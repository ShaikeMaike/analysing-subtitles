Get off me!
Oh, please.
Please, don't hurt me.
It's wrong! She's too young!
The sins of the flesh will ruin her.
Please don't hurt me!
Please!
The wicked will be punished.
"The mystery heart condition that has killed over 30 people in 4 years... has claimed another victim.
Doctors are baffled as to why fit and healthy people... are suffering massive heart attacks.
Many residents claim that the 'Shadow of Death'... has again descended on the town."
"Shadow of Death"?
I don't like it.
That's what they're saying.
People are scared out there.
"For decades, Fairwater has been linked with death... following the 1964
Bradley-Bartlett murder spree.
Thirty years later, as the death toll steadily rises... it appears the Grim Reaper has once again returned... to the quiet streets of Fairwater."
Oh, no. Steve, no.
I asked for a new angle.
Give me something fresh.
I want to see the human face of this tragedy. Talk to the families.
How has this affected the local community?
Yes, Miss Rees-Jones.
And, Steve... no more references to death as a person.
Friend of the family?
Really such a shame.
Go on. Get out. Go on.
Get out!
Damn.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
I don't believe this.
This is not happening. My lawn!
You ruptured my lawn!
Hey, how you doing?
Give me a call.
I'll pay for the damages.
You're damn right! I'm suing your ass!
Don't get litigious. Send me a bill.
"Frank Bannister, Psychic Investigator"?
So why didn't you see the corner coming?
You stupid moron!
This is goddamn bullshit!
This will cost you big time!
You're paying for a new fence!
I want this lawn completely resurfaced!
Budzo!
My Budzo! My Budzo!
I got your license plate number!
You bastard!
This is private property.
Mrs. Bradley? I'm Dr. Lynskey.
I work at the medical center.
You do not.
I know who works there.
I started 3 months ago.
Dr. Kamins is my physician.
He's attending a funeral.
I'm seeing his patients today.
She was cutting vegetables.
The knife slipped.
She just needs a few stitches.
I'll drive you to the clinic.
That's impossible.
It's a deep cut.
Leave us antibiotics.
Mother, please.
Patricia never leaves the house.
But it hurts.
To your room this instant!
Wait. Just a minute.
Who did that to you?
I think you'd better go now,
Dr. Lynskey.
You don't know who my daughter is, do you?
Patricia's not to be trusted.
I beg your pardon?
I can have her locked up anytime I want.
They said she was an accessory after the fact.
I know the truth.
It was cold-blooded murder.
In the space of 27 blood-soaked minutes...
12 innocent people were shot by hospital orderly John Charles Bartlett.
Patients, medical staff, visitors... no one was spared in this rampage through Fairwater Sanatorium.
Not even the hospital chapel... provided sanctuary, as those in prayer were shot on their knees.
We're reporters.
We have to get the news!
A seemingly senseless crime...
Bartlett's motive remains a mystery to this day.
Johnny Bartlett.
He's got a demonic look on his face.
Any comments, Johnny?
Got me a score of 12, sir.
That's one more than Starkweather.
Six years earlier,
Charles Starkweather had murdered... eleven people in a Nebraska killing spree.
Guess that makes me public enemy number one!
Fifteen-year-old
Patricia Anne Bradley... daughter of the hospital administrator... was also implicated in the killings.
She was madly in love with the psychopath Bartlett.
That's her!
I was in her house this afternoon.
Terrific. We're in town 3 months and you've befriended the Manson family.
2200 volts of electricity... ended the life of Johnny Bartlett, the unrepentant killer.
As they threw the switch, he screamed:
"I got me a score of twelve.
Beat that."
In what some considered a miscarriage of justice...
Patricia Bradley was sentenced to life imprisonment... although it was never proven she participated in the killings.
Five years ago,
Patricia Bradley was granted... a conditional release by the governor.
Today she lives a reclusive life back in the family home...
Should have fried her along with Bartlett.
She was fifteen years old.
She fell in love with the wrong guy.
Could happen to anyone.
Sweetie, don't go back there.
Place gives me the creeps.
I don't think...
Come on, honey.
I think tiger's getting a little lonely.
What the hell is this doing here?
I thought I tore this up.
- Did he come back here?
- Who?
The moron who tore up my fence!
Help!
- Help!
- He's alive.
Ray, get me off!
You... sick... thing!
Lucy, I don't want that con man in my house!
There has to be some kind of rational explanation for this.
Ray! We have got a poltergeist!
It's nothing the police can't handle.
Bannister.
Dr. Lynskey, I'm on my way.
Persistent residue of the departed.
Always a problem this time of year.
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.
The activity is located where?
I don't know. It went quiet about 5 minutes ago.
Went quiet?
The dining room table spun in a counterclockwise direction?
I don't think that happened.
The toilet seat lid banged up and down?
- Did the bed levitate?
- Yeah. With me on it.
Spontaneous recurrent psychokinesis.
Oh, boy.
This could be the worst case
I've ever seen. It's bad.
Well, I can do a clearance, but it's not going to be cheap.
I do offer a six-month guarantee.
How much?
And there is a 30% surcharge for making a house call after midnight.
And there's vehicle, gas.
I'd say the whole thing will set you back about $450.
We could forget about the fence, call it even.
Stand back, ma'am. I don't want you to have to sign a waiver.
Plus, a hundred bucks for materials.
Just do it, for Christ's sake.
Here we go.
Why us? Why are they in our house?
Emanations are normally confined to the cemetery... although they do escape.
Usually young ones.
Oh, for God's sake, come on.
Come on.
It's holy water.
This is bullshit.
This is total bullshit.
Come on, come on, come on.
Yes!
Okay, these belong to you.
Six ectoplasmic emanations.
Don't worry. They can't escape.
Some people like a souvenir.
I really don't think we want to keep those. Thank you. Do we, hon?
I could give a rat's ass.
Okay, we'll just...
They can't feel a thing.
At least that's what the book says.
You never know for sure.
All right. Thank you, Bannister.
You can go.
What are you staring at?
What's with the number?
What number?
If you're trying to freak me out, it's not working.
He's just trying to get more money out of us.
Get your shit and get the hell out of my house.
Come on.
Move!
Thank you so much.
There you go.
- Thanks.
- Thank you.
Why must you always alienate everybody?
I think I'm going to throw up.
Damn.
I hate that trunk!
I don't want ectoplasmic muck all over my car seats.
The ectoplasm is the only thing sticky enough... to hold the damn car together.
I'm sorry about your shit Volvo, but we won't ride in the trunk no more.
We could like to cruise with some style, man.
You two left me high and dry.
I get to the house, nothing's happening. I couldn't believe it.
Hey, Stuart... in or out.
Not even a banging toilet lid.
I looked like a asshole.
We strained our backs lifting that heavy-ass bed.
Oh, yeah. What idiot put the number on the guy's forehead?
It wasn't funny.
Start pulling your weight, or it's back to the cemetery.
Pull this, Frank. I'm about to go like Jesse on your ass.
I'm going to find some other black ghosts and organize a march.
The African-American
Apparition Coalition. The AAAC.
I'll tell you something.
Nothing's worse than some pissed-off brothers that's already dead!
Therefore, a happy ghost is a productive ghost.
To that end, I've drawn up a list of suggestions.
Bear in mind, we have given you five years of loyal service.
Flies. That's what you've given me, flies.
Why do flies stick to you guys like shit to a blanket?
Very funny. You're a funny guy.
You only think about yourself.
I could complain, too.
I need some new clothes. I still look like Linc from "The Mod Squad".
You died in the '70s. Bummer.
Now, Frank, we got to talk about cigars.
You promised to buy me a box.
I hate to tell you, but you're dead. You can't smoke.
Light one and blow the smoke in my face.
If I light a cigar,
I'll blow my lunch in your face.
Everybody, get down!
Damn it, Judge!
Put the shooters away!
That was a head shot!
He could have killed me!
If I wanted to get shot at every day,
I'd move to Los Angeles!
When a man's jawbone drops off... it's time to reassess the situation.
I got myself... a nice little grave up there at the cemetery.
It could soon be time to lay my bones.
You're my go-to guy.
Without you, I'm out of business.
Frightening... that's a young man's game, Frank.
I ain't got no more hauntings left in me.
What? You're in... great shape.
My joints are getting powdery.
The dog is running away with my face.
Hell, I'm falling apart.
You have been for years.
Don't say nothing to the boys, but... my ectoplasm is all dried up.
I'm sorry to hear that, Judge.
Give it up, Frank.
Death ain't no way to make a living.
I have to finish this house.
You'll never finish this house!
You'll never finish nothing!
You're fooling yourself, Frank!
Too many skeletons in the closet.
Okay, this is it.
We got to be hard.
We go in like Charles Bronson.
We don't stop till the screaming starts.
I'm with you.
Let's go.
Yeah. Let's kick some ass.
Here we go.
One, two, three.
Good morning, my darlings. Hello.
The mail is on the table,
Mrs. Waterhouse.
Sylvia, Mother is coming for lunch.
Pick up. Quick.
Big kiss.
Quit jumping around like a baby.
This is serious.
We're going to scare the living daylights out of your parents.
- Will you help us out?
- Are you with us?
See? He gets it.
The kids always get it.
Let's go.
Mrs. Waterhouse.
Mrs. Waterhouse!
Damn. Here, man.
This one did le poo-poo.
- Get it away from me.
- Oh, man, it smells.
Mrs. Waterhouse!
My babies!
Frank Bannister.
I'm on my way.
Persistent residue of the departed.
Always a problem this time of year.
Frank Bannister. I believe you called.
Not a minute too soon.
- Frank, she...
- Shut up.
Frank, it's no use.
This is bad.
Recurrent spontaneous psychokinesis.
This could be the worst case
I have ever... seen.
I apologize for calling you,
Mr. Bannister. Please leave.
What are you doing to me?
Preying on the bereaved is as low as you can go.
You're a parasite.
People should be warned.
I've a right to offer my services to the public.
In case you haven't noticed, we are having a major health crisis.
The last thing the people here need is a two-bit charlatan... passing on bogus messages from the other side.
Now, if you will excuse me.
I'm just trying to make a living.
Living? Not a word you'd know a lot about, is it, Mr. Bannister?
Hey, easy.
You all right, buddy?
That was quite a fall.
Bannister!
You have to help.
They're going to bury me.
You have to help.
What is happening to me?
You appear to be dead, Ray.
That's impossible.
I'm in the prime of my life.
I work out.
My wife's a doctor!
- Why didn't you take the corridor?
- What corridor?
The passageway to the other side.
Because I don't belong there!
Jesus Christ, I'm only 29!
Just relax, all right?
Tell me what happened.
I was on the rowing machine.
Suddenly, I felt this vice-like grip squeezing my heart... and I couldn't breathe, Frank,
I just couldn't breathe.
I have the shakes.
I need some vitamin B.
You can't take vitamins anymore.
You don't eat, drink or go to the bathroom. All that's over with.
In a year, you'll get another chance for the other side, to be a pure spirit.
In the meantime, you're an earthbound emanation... a rotting cloud of bioplasmic particles, dripping ectoplasm.
Relax, Ray.
All right, Bannister.
Can you give me a ride so I don't miss my funeral?
Don't worry.
They won't hurt you.
What in the hell is going on out here?
Get back in your graves!
Son of a...
Holy Jesus.
Frank Bannister!
Go ahead. I'll handle this.
What are you doing in my graveyard?
You have been told to stay away!
Sound off like you have a pair!
It's a public place, Hiles.
I do not like you!
Do not bring your spooks in here without permission. Disappear, scumbag!
I am not one of your shitty little emanations!
You cannot push spirits around!
You are scum!
Using spooks to put the frighteners on people! That makes me physically ill!
We have a lot of lowlifes around here!
I will provide an armed response at any sign of trouble!
They must be contained!
Catch you later, Hiles.
My tour of duty runs another 85 years!
There's a piece of dirt here with your name on it.
I'm waiting for you, you little maggot!
There were times when people accused Ray... of being less than generous, but I am sure that deep down... the man possessed a heart of gold and a generous spirit.
It's true. He wouldn't lie, not at a time like this.
Because God has chosen... to call Ray from this life to Himself, we commit his body to the ground.
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Jesus, what a waste.
It's a goddamn tragedy!
Good-bye, Ray.
Oh, sweetheart, don't cry.
Oh, shit!
Hey, Frank!
I know you can hear me!
Get me out of this hole!
Frank! Get me out!
Hiya, Frank.
Hi, Walt.
I'm surprised to see you.
Here on business?
Not exactly.
They're going to bury me alive!
I hear you and Lynskey had a little run-in the night before he died.
Apart from his wife... you were the last person to see him alive.
You're the one here on business.
No. The FBI is very concerned about these deaths.
They look like heart attacks... but when they slice these people open, their arteries are... clean as a whistle.
But there's been tremendous pressure on the heart... like the life's been crushed out of it.
You got any theories?
Bannister!
You mind if I pay my last respects before they fill him in?
Yeah. I'm sorry.
Bannister!
Please.
Mr. Bannister.
Did you want to see me?
My God, Frank, she can see me!
I thought perhaps you might have a message from Ray.
Tell her. Tell her I'm here, Frank.
Tell her.
Everyone says you're a fraud, but I've seen what you can do.
Frank!
You must think I'm very stupid.
Excuse me.
Lucy.
Ray says he loves you very much.
Here is your table.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Is Ray with us?
Tell her she looks great.
He, uh, he says you look great.
Tell her they're from me.
Those are from Ray.
It's our anniversary.
He says it's your anniversary.
Is... Is Ray beside me?
Greetings.
How are you this evening?
May I offer you some wine?
Lucy, do you want some?
What... red, white?
Red. We always have red.
White.
I've never liked red.
Lucy!
So you used to be an architect?
Long time ago.
Can it. She doesn't want to hear your life story.
Wow. So, did you build your own house?
Is it your dream home?
You could call it that.
I'll build you a dream home once I get on my feet.
Why is it you can see Ray and I can't?
I was in an accident.
It was a car accident.
About five years ago.
They say that... sometimes when you have a traumatic experience... it can alter your perception.
So after that, you could just see spirits?
I mean, what happened?
How about you talk to Ray?
That's why I'm here.
Finally, I'm in the conversation.
Terrific.
I do have an important question
I have to ask Ray.
He can hear you.
Ray...
I really need to know where you invested my money.
The $16,000 that I had saved.
The attorneys can't find it.
Oh, shit! I blew it on a bad investment.
Don't tell her that.
Let me think.
It's gone.
Lucy, it's gone.
Blown on a bad investment.
You asshole!
Tell her I'll look out for her.
I'll move back into the house.
That's not a good idea.
This doesn't concern you.
What's Ray saying?
He left. Ray left.
He said he's sorry, but you should get on with your life.
Bannister, I'm going to kill you!
I can't believe it. That's just like
Ray to just take the money and run.
Ray and I haven't been honest with each other in a long time, Mr. Bannister.
It wasn't what you would call a good marriage.
You bitch!
Lt'll be okay.
Hands off my wife!
Goddamn it!
Sorry.
I can move shit, Bannister.
You better watch your back.
I better clean this up.
Be right back.
Good food, huh?
Yeah... it's great.
Mom!
Looks like another heart attack.
Can't confirm it till the autopsy.
Damn.
A waiter saw a guy exit the john right before the body was found.
And who was that?
Frank Bannister, pale and shaking.
The waiter thought he was sick.
Damn.
Hi, Lucy.
Dr. Lynskey works for me.
We're colleagues.
She's a material witness.
Bannister was last seen in the restaurant parking lot.
He took off at high speed.
Bring him in.
Look at that!
So your dead husband was having dinner with you?
What did he order?
Oh, God. Excuse me.
Timmy, front desk, please.
Thank you.
Lucy, this is Special Agent
Milton Dammers of the FBI.
I came by train. I planned to fly, but I didn't feel good about the plane.
At what time... precisely, did Bannister leave for the bathroom?
You.
I'm not sure... precisely.
Did he use excessive amounts of salt?
Answer the question.
For Christ's sake, it's really late!
I don't remember!
What is this?
Excuse me, Lucy.
I'll be right back.
Milton...
Sorry, Sheriff.
I have a problem with women yelling.
Can I get you anything?
Sheriff Perry!
You are violating my territorial bubble.
Lucy, you're still grieving.
It would be easy for a man like Frank to take advantage.
You have such closed minds.
I object!
Special Agent Dammers has over...
20 years' experience in the area of... paranormal psychology.
Much of that was spent undercover... with various... cults and sects.
I get all the fruity cases,
Mrs. Lynskey.
For God's sake, Milton, come in and sit down.
I'm more comfortable standing.
What has this to do with Frank?
Mrs. Lynskey, you know nothing about Frank Bannister.
You claim he's a bona fide psychic... yet all I have heard is ill-informed, meandering waffle.
On the third day of July 1990...
Frank Bannister, then a successful architect... was overseeing construction of his new home.
The contractor...
Jacob Platz... would later confirm that Bannister was consuming alcohol that morning.
Platz sees Bannister arguing with his wife, Debra.
It appears he had promised Debra a garden... and then, without consulting her, laid a 4-inch thick concrete slab... creating a basketball court for himself.
Platz watches the couple drive away.
Bannister kept a tool box in the back of his car.
In it was a utility knife... with a retractable blade.
Bannister purchased seven... new blades that morning... at Jesson's Hardware Store and Building Supply... on Third and Garrett...
Third and Garrett.
Third of July.
Seven blades. Three.
Milton... you're mumbling; we can't understand a word you're saying.
Their '84 Volvo heads into the hills.
It is the last time anyone will see the couple together.
By Bannister's admission... the argument continues, reaching a point... when Debra demands... to be let out.
At that moment, probably 12:36, leaves the road on a curve... presumably because Bannister was driving too fast.
She was killed?
Her body was found
15 yards from the car.
Bannister... was picked up 2 hours later, wandering in the woods.
He claimed to have no recollection of the events... that occurred after the accident.
But here's the odd thing,
Mrs. Lynskey.
His utility knife... was missing.
And to this day, it has not been found.
But do you know what was really bizarre?
Debra's corpse had the number 13... carved into its forehead.
Unlucky for some.
You're insane. You're talking about a mythical figure.
A pseudo-religious icon from the 12th century.
Save your pea-brained prattle for the classroom, boy.
That was the Soul Collector.
He's been taking people out since time began.
He's going about some dark business here in Fairwater... and we ain't nothing but worm bait!
When your number's up... that's it!
There's another one gone.
He's gone.
There's no money for you here,
Mr. Bannister.
You're next.
Are you threatening me?
That's not what I'm saying.
He's threatening to kill me.
- Will you relax?
- He is threatening to kill me!
Bannister!
Oh, great.
Hey, fellas.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Put the gun away.
- Freeze!
- Just take it easy.
Okay, Bannister, you're under arrest.
Just stay there, Bannister.
Yes.
Great.
I did it.
Uh-uh-uh, Bannister. Stop.
Looks like I ain't shooting with blanks no more!
Mighty fine woman.
Good teeth.
Judge.
Down!
They don't call me the hanging judge for nothing.
Stay right there.
Heads up!
Good catch.
Freeze!
Good shooting, Tex.
And she was so young and beautiful!
I like it when they lie still like that.
This is heavy.
Hey, guys!
My juices are flowing again!
Judge!
Judge!
Bannister!
Frank, get out of here, now!
Bastard!
Got to go.
Bannister!
Stop!
Damn! Come on!
Just get down!
Get down and stay down.
Magda!
Listen to me.
No!
Where'd he go?
You killed me, you bastard!
You're sick!
Is this how you get your kicks?
Did it feel good killing me?
Did it feel good killing your wife?
You're a murderer!
He won't get far.
We have the state line covered.
Sheriff Perry...
I seriously doubt we will see Bannister any time soon.
He is resourceful beyond anything you can comprehend.
Hello, Frank.
Hey, Walt.
I've come to report that...
Magda Rees-Jones's... body is lying near my car... off Holloway Road.
Did you have anything to do with her death?
Frank, are you okay?
What happened?
What are you doing?
You're arresting him?
Please leave.
Frank, you need a lawyer.
Go home, Lucy.
But you haven't done anything.
He hasn't done anything!
How do you know?
Do you know me?
Am I a nice guy?
Because... that cozy scene in the restaurant was bullshit.
Because...
I was doing my job.
I don't give a damn about you or anyone.
What are you saying?
Go home.
Are you okay to drive?
There has been a destructive force unleashed on this town... such as I have never seen.
We have a body count... of 28.
You're a very dangerous man.
You're not seriously suggesting that Frank is responsible for...
You're way out of your depth here,
Sheriff. Please leave.
Frank Bannister is my prisoner.
By the power invested in me by the President of the United States...
I am telling you... to get the hell out of this room.
Have you ever heard of Nina Kulagina?
March 10, 1970, Nina Kulagina, with the power of her mind... stopped the beat of a frog's heart.
The record of this experiment is currently held... in the files of Professor Gennady
Sergeyev of Saint Petersburg.
As Sergeyev interpreted the cardiogram... the heart experienced a flare-up of electrical activity.
The heart imploded... all because Nina Kulagina wanted the animal dead.
I don't kill people.
Part of you believes that.
There's another part of you, Frank... that's out of control.
Your destructive impulse.
I've seen a figure in a cape.
I've seen him reach into people's chests and squeeze their hearts.
Who was it?
Who was it?
Death.
I can communicate with the other side.
I can see spirits.
I don't know why.
I can't understand it.
You think you're quite unique, don't you?
But in my business, I deal with your type every other week.
This death figure... is nothing more than a homicidal alter ego... that satisfies your compulsion to kill.
Every time you want to kill someone...
"death" does it for you.
It's your way of absolving yourself of guilt.
No!
When did you first start seeing spirits? After Debra's death?
You killed your wife.
No!
I have studied... the coroner's reports of every death here since 1985.
Twenty-eight cases involved crushed hearts... arteries choked until they burst.
That started in 1990, with your... beautiful wife, Debra.
She was the first.
Ray Lynskey.
You argue with him,
3 hours later he's dead.
We know you didn't like
Magda Rees-Jones.
But what about the guy in the toilet?
What did he do to you, Frank?
Piss on your Hush Puppies?
Why are you shaking?
Oh, my.
My, my. You're doing it right now, aren't you?
You're trying to kill me, right now.
Well, forget it, Bannister.
I'm wearing a lead breastplate!
We have 28... unexplained deaths here.
You know what I think?
I think you... are involved in each and every one of them!
Well, so much for the dream home.
What are we doing here, Lucy?
Look at this place.
It's a dump!
God, this guy is a loser.
Perfectly good basketball court gone to pot.
Yeah, Bannister.
Mr. Bannister, help me!
My daughter, Patricia, is communing with the Evil One.
He's in this house at her instigation.
Help me drive them out!
Lucy, why do you keep shutting me out?
Lucy!
Patricia?
Dr. Lynskey.
Patricia, are you all right?
It's your mother.
She's been hurting you.
She needs help.
She's delusional.
You can't go on like this.
You don't understand.
No!
My father killed himself after the murders.
Mother says it was my fault.
So I have to keep his ashes in my room.
Oh, my God.
She says I'm evil.
Just like Johnny.
Come with me to Mother's room.
This isn't you.
This isn't who you are now.
It was Johnny.
He went crazy.
I couldn't get away from him.
I thought he'd kill me.
You have to get out of this house.
You can start over.
It's Mother. Please hide.
Please.
I'll take her to the kitchen.
You sneak out later.
What are you doing in here?
I thought I heard a noise.
I'll make you some coffee, Mother.
Mother.
The coffee's ready.
Lucy, go.
Thank you, Deputy.
Just call me when you're done,
Dr. Lynskey.
Frank, listen to me.
I found your knife, hidden in old lady Bradley's closet.
She's crazy, Frank.
You haven't hurt anybody.
You're a good person, Frank.
Don't do this.
Please, don't do this.
Do you think you're the only person who ever lost somebody?
You walk around like you have no feelings... but the truth is you're just scared!
Goddamn hypocrite.
Why are you doing this?
What are you afraid of?
I don't want to hurt you, Lucy.
Oh, that's crap.
Don't give me that.
Look at me.
I'll be outside. This shit is like walking in on your parents.
Oh, right. I'll be outside.
I'll just...
What is it, Frank?
Look out!
You son of a bitch!
What's happening?
Grab him! Grab him!
What's happening?
Okay. Listen to me.
Call for the deputy.
And try to sound calm.
Deputy!
I'm ready to leave.
Where did he go?
Stuart, where did he go?
I think we got him.
You son of a bitch!
Get out, Frank! Go!
It's this way. Go.
Freeze, Bannister.
- Help.
- I got you now.
Help me. He's gone crazy.
Okay. Ah! Stay back!
Now...
Frank, come on!
Go, Frank!
Get out of here! Now!
Frank, let's go!
This way. Come on.
Shit!
What was in that cell?
Something was crushing my heart.
I can't fight him, Luce.
I can't protect you.
There's one way to deal with this thing.
I have to have an out-of-body experience, and I have to have it now.
Go away, Luce.
Walk the other way.
Wait. Wait.
This will slow your heart and lower your temperature.
You'll have 20 minutes. Any longer and there's a danger of tissue damage.
That's only if I successfully revive you. There's no guarantee.
Frank, you don't have to do this.
Better close the door.
Hurry up.
It won't take long.
I didn't know you had an interest in cryogenics.
I'm reviving him at 9:00.
Why would we want to do that?
Luce!
Lucy?
There we go.
Let me go, you bastard!
Let me out now!
You bastard, let me out of this car now!
I find cemeteries very... restful places, don't you?
Turn this car around and take me back.
I intend to, Mrs. Lynskey.
In exactly... eleven hours' time.
Son of a bitch!
Let me out of here!
Come back here, you creep!
My body... is a road map of pain.
But pain... has its reward.
The power of the mind... is absolute.
Frank, is that you?
I'm doing this?
I'm doing this?
I'm moving the car with the power of my mind!
Yes!
No!
Wait!
Get back in the goddamn ground!
You unorganized grab-asstic gob of teleplasmic shit!
Who the hell are you?
Sound off like you've got a pair!
Hey, asshole.
He's dead!
You're too late!
Lucy!
Who are you?
Who... are... you?
Johnny Bartlett.
I thought guys like you fried in hell.
I got out, Frank.
I've been carrying on the good work.
Got me a score of 40.
Harry Sinclair.
I want to shake the hand of the man who avenged my death.
You have a number.
Bartlett carved it into my forehead as I lay dying.
I was the last.
He couldn't be more wrong, could he, Frank?
Shit!
Oh, Frank.
Just breathe.
Breathe slowly. Breathe.
You're okay.
Oh, Frank.
All right, Lucy, come on.
Get me 100 milligrams of lidocaine and 1 cc of adrenaline.
I didn't get him.
Who? Who didn't you get, Frank?
Johnny Bartlett. He's back.
He's hallucinating.
He's killing again.
Patricia.
You have to get her out of the house.
Go.
Go!
Patricia!
Listen to me.
We have to get out of here.
Patricia never leaves the house!
She's coming with me.
You have no right.
Get upstairs.
This is stopping now.
What do you mean?
Why do you have
Frank Bannister's knife?
You've been in my room!
Mother!
Mother wants to go to the police.
She'll be down in a minute.
Patricia, we have to go now.
It's not safe here.
Johnny Bartlett is back.
I know.
He visits me at night.
I don't know why he comes.
He torments me.
Why has he come?
Am I being punished?
Patricia, let's just go. Please.
I want to kill her, Patty.
That'll give us 41.
That's 8 clear of Gacy.
Nine more, we break Bundy's record.
I can't wait to see his face when he hears the news.
- Yes!
- What?
I'm sorry.
We really should wait for Mother.
That asswipe psychic nearly ruined it for us, Patty.
He made us look stupid.
You'll be okay.
Everything will be fine.
Shut up! That Russian cannibal creep is telling everyone he did 50 plus.
That reflects badly on both of us, Patty.
This record should be held by an American.
I quite agree.
You can come... stay with me, if you like.
I'll kill her now.
I'd like that.
I'll just get my coat.
Patronizing do-gooder bitch!
Oh, Patricia.
You kill her. I'll watch.
Mrs. Bradley?
Mrs. Bradley, are you coming with us?
Oh, my God.
Lucy!
No, not that way!
Jesus.
These are Bartlett's ashes.
We must get them to the other side.
A church. We have to get them to a church.
There's a chapel in the old hospital!
No!
Let's go down here.
Where is it?
You look there.
Lucy?
Oh, this is great.
Frank?
Excuse me, Doctor.
We're looking for ward 12.
Go up the stairs to the 4th floor, then turn right.
It's opposite the chapel.
I'll get someone to help.
Orderly!
Orderly, are you deaf?
I said, orderly are you deaf?
Moron!
I guess that makes you number one.
Get down!
Frank, are you okay?
The chapel's on the fourth floor.
Watch out!
We got to go. Go!
Lucy.
Lucy!
You're all the same.
Wait!
Put the gun down, son.
The law is on its way.
What's the score, Patty?
Eleven.
That's the same as Starkweather's.
Lucy?
It's jammed.
Take it. Just take it!
Be right back.
Don't go anywhere.
Give that to me.
Let me guess.
You must get these ashes to consecrated ground... to destroy the forces of evil.
Give me the goddamn urn!
Under no circumstances must these ashes ever be released.
Oops.
You have no idea what you've just done.
You just don't get it, do you, Frank?
This is all about your pathetic need for self-glorification.
You are such an asshole.
Yes, I am.
I am an asshole... with an Uzi!
Get up!
You make me sick!
Get up!
I won't shoot you in the back.
Turn around.
I said, turn around!
As a U.S. Government agent,
I order you to turn around!
Oh, my God, Frank.
Debra.
You killed her.
You're next, pal.
Take him out, baby.
Get him!
Stop!
Frank, no!
Get him, Patty.
Oh, baby, you are an artist.
You're 42!
Yes.
I'm in the mood for a little vivisection.
No! No, please.
Me, too.
Oh, me, too.
You bitch!
I got your girlfriend, Johnny!
Come get her!
Goddamn you!
Let go of her!
Come and get her, you coward!
Let go of my little Patty!
See you later, Frank!
We got you!
We're going back down to get us some more!
Yo, Frank!
How's it going?
Bye, Frank.
Johnny? Johnny!
Step back, Frank.
This won't be pleasant.
The old express bus to hell.
No lines, no waiting.
It's really something, isn't it?
Excellent libraries.
Premium cigars.
And, of course... the honeys.
How about that? Stu's a regular chick magnet up here.
Hello, Frank.
It's time to go home.
I am home.
Ahhh, no.
The authorities have informed us that it's just not your time.
Start living, dude.
Be happy.
There's something
I have to tell you.
Sorry to interrupt.
It's all right, Walt.
Frank, what do you know about Ouija boards?
Not a lot.
I found a stack of them at the Bradley house.
Looks like Patricia got herself a direct line to Bartlett... once she was released 5 years ago.
I thought you and I could collaborate on a book about this.
It could be my ticket off the force.
That's not my area.
If you need a collaborator, how about your guardian angel there?
You got me, Frank.
I got you.
I'll see you, Frank.
Bye-bye.
Boy, that Dammers, he sure looks pissed.
Sometimes when you go through a traumatic experience... it alters your perception.
Houston, this is Excursion.
We see a good orbit-insertion burn. Over.
Excursion, this is Houston.
We copy and concur.
Good 0-1 burn.
Houston, can you confirm good K. U. antenna coverage
for lander deploy?
INCO, this is the flight director.
How is our K. U. for lander docking system release?
Flight, this is INCO.
We should have good K. U. coverage all the way through L. DS. release.
In fact, we're covered all the way through the landing and air lock egress.
Houston, stack going to minus Z-L-V.

We confirm rover two's telemetry is go for deploy.
Excursion, this is Houston.
Are you receiving rover one's carrier signal through the landers uplink?
That's affirm, Houston. We expect excellent video from rover one.
Not for one nation…
not for one people…
not for one creed…
but for all humankind.
Patrick Ross,
son of a senator, football star at Yale, and now the first man on Mars.
A perfect hero for these imperfect times.
Patrick, this is Excursion.
I need you to check rover two's next drilling site for me.
Patrick, would you take a look at your primary O-2…
and power levels on your DC. M
Suit parameters all look good.
Structure around is loamy.
Loose topsoil is rock.
Drill bit shows signs of wear and tear.
It'll last. One more area.
Sector 112, okay?
It might have been a canal bed.
Eight years of training, and I'm a Martian ditchdigger.
You have 1 hour, 30 minutes surface time left.
And counting.
Final sample loaded.
Prepping for air lock ingress.
In a world beset by violence, hunger and strife…
there are occasions when mankind surpasses…
the petty struggles of daily existence.
The Excursion voyage to Mars is one of those occasions.
Today America is proud.
I told them not to go!
Three, two, one…
Let's get you out of here.
Oh, my God.
It was incredible.
A tremendous achievement that once again proves…
that if we can rise above partisan politics…
America can climb to the heavens.
Thank you, Mr President.
The credit goes to my crew.
Fly home safe, son.
Our prayers are with you and…
God bless you.
Thank you, Mr President.
Flight, Nav. We'd like the crew to take a star tracker pass…
and perform an I. MU. alignment before we update the state vector.
CAPCOM, let the crew know Navigation wants a fix on a star position…
and alignment of the interior moment unit…
before putting a new state vector on board.
Houston, this is Excursion.
We have your new state vector on board.
Excursion, Houston. We copy you.
Have received the updated vector.
Coming up on TIG for transfer orbit burn.
Copy.
Excursion, you are good to go.
Thanks, Huston.
Thirty seconds to transfer orbit TIG.
We're homeward bound, baby.
Yes, sirs!

For the past three minutes…
every attempt to communicate with the Excursion has failed.
I told 'em not to go to Mars!
I told 'em not to go!
G. C., Flight. Check all relay stations on the network.
Have the backup TDRS on standby.
Flight to all operators.
Pull up your data passes from the burn.
Get with your back rooms.
Verify that we saw no anomalies.
For God's sake, somebody tell me she didn't blow.
Houston, this is Excursion.
We had a malfunction in the K. U. band antenna.
Lost telemetry and comm.
I performed a bit of I. F. M
Seems to be okay now.
Excursion crew is okay.
Headed for rendezvous with Big Blue.
It's gonna be good to get home.
Over and out.
The Extraterrestrial
Vulnerability Experiment… has one central goal: to discover a means to defend ourselves… against the alien species should they ever return to Earth.
Now, as you know, gentlemen,
Eve was re-created from a frozen lab embryo.
She's a genetic duplicate of the original Sil.
Now, we have deliberately shielded Eve… from any direct contact with the male gender… which is why, gentlemen, you're inside there.
So… proceed.
Help!
Laura! Please!
Okay, that's enough.
Bring her up.
Bingo, Dr Baker!
It worked!
Take a look at those beautiful welts.
Just beautiful.
What happened, Dr Baker?
Our problem in a nutshell:
A toxic agent works once… but then it becomes useless once the alien's biology adapts.
You've gone out of your way to give this… this lab animal… a living situation that's fit for a queen!
I suggest you spend more time finding a way to 86 the damn thing.
Colonel, you're welcome to replace me anytime you like.
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
Tell Dr Baker we must continue testing.
Aye, aye, sir.
Why do you do this to me?
I'm sorry, Eve.
I've explained to you why we've got to do this… what happened with the first Sil.
And why you have to be prepared.
Survival of the fittest.
I know.
I watch this TV… and I see all the places
I'm never gonna go… and see all the people
I'm never gonna meet.
Is that all I am to you?
A laboratory animal?
I want you to understand that the reason I took this job… was to make sure that these experiments were done with regard for you.
Just don't forget that I'm human too.
Main gear touchdown.
Shuttle ground support vehicles with flight surgeon and medical team…
in the crew recovery vehicle are en route.
Thanks, Houston.
It's good to be home.
–Thanks.
–You're welcome.
On preliminary examination, all three of you are in remarkable health… though, of course, I'll continue more specific blood testing.
We do have a few people here who would like a further examination.
Boy, there's enough fine booty out there to cure what ails me.
You're under quarantine,
Mr Gamble.
No sexual activity for at least ten days.
–And that means all of you.
–Oh, you've gotta be kidding.
No, I'm not kidding.
Back when President Kennedy began the space program…
I was just a very young assistant up on the Hill.
It didn't take me long to realize that he was a visionary… and that I shared that vision.
Later on, when I became a senator…
I was determined to push our program even further into space.
And so today,
Jack Kennedy's vision… is maintained by the commitment of American business.
But I like to think that his spirit is embodied… in young men like Patrick Ross.
–When Patrick was five years old…
–What happened to Patrick?
I don't know, but he's missing some major butt-kissing from his own father.
He hasn't been feeling very well tonight.
Tell you the truth, I haven't been feeling so great either.
Yeah, I think what we all need is a little tender loving care.
So it's with pleasure that I introduce one of our finest young leaders, the captain of the Mars mission, and my son, Patrick Ross.
I've gotta go.
Lincoln suite, upstairs.
Hurry.
Captain Ross, everyone's waiting. This way, sir.
Nice of you to show up.
Thank you all for coming out this evening.
Thank you, Father, for what I'm sure were overly kind words.
I've been chosen on behalf of my wonderful crew… to represent the mission to Mars… and an image that comes to my mind… is looking through the porthole… at the blue-white globe… beautiful… so fragile, so small.
And I thought to myself… how easy it would be to destroy all that God has created.
I think, as we look to the future… our greatest mission might be right here at home.
It's open.
Come on in.
My sister decided to join us.
We share everything… together.
Parker's going for two, and he's in there, standing!
Pulse rate is 20 percent below human norm.
What do you expect, Brea?
She's watching baseball.
Oh, God!
You are a hero.
Oh, God.
It's my turn.
Yes, it is.
Here it comes!
Parker's going for three!
Jeez! Did someone hit a home run?
My God, help me!
Get off me!
Marcy! Get him off me!
Oh, my God!
Help me, someone!
–What the hell is going on?
–My God!
Last night, after the fund-raiser… something happened.
I try to think about it,
I draw a total blank.
They always make those drinks at those fund-raisers strong.
That's the way they get the wallets to open up.
Billy, you tell that old son-of-a-bitch
I won't take no for an answer.
There's something wrong with me,
Dad, since I got back.
Do you think a trip to Mars was rough?
You just wait till you try a senate campaign.
Dad, listen to me.
I'm having…
I'm having some kind of breakdown.
Stop thinking about the master plan and help me, all right? I'm scared.
Goddamn it!
Quit acting like a spoiled child.
You're a Ross.
Behave like one.
And I'm gonna give you a piece of advice, boy.
You keep your dick in your pants and your eyes on the prize.
Oh, I know what you been doin', and frankly, I don't give a damn.
But I have seen too many young men with promising careers… piss it all away on a piece of ass.
People love you, Patrick.
Hell, boy, they idolize you.
You're gonna be President of the United States someday.
Now, let's take a walk through the gallery.
Some of my illustrious colleagues are just dyin' to get your autograph.
Yes, sir.
Yes, it's very important that I speak with Herman Cromwell.
No, he's a patient there.
Well, can I get a message to him that Dr Orinsky called
from the lab at Oldham Space Center up in Maryland?
Yes, it's very important that I speak to him.
I'm an old colleague of his.
I can't believe this.
Oh, my God!
Company, halt! Left, left…
The substance found
in Dr Orinsky's wounds is combinant alien-human DNA.
This DNA is structurally similar to Eve's… but it's not a perfect match.
Obviously, Eve has not left the compound… which means, gentlemen, that there's another one out there.
None of our intelligence suggests that a foreign power was involved.
How do we start looking for this thing?
Well, I would suggest normal investigative procedure… to cultivate a list of possible suspects and then test their blood.
Thank you, Dr Baker. We may ask you to help us track it down.
Always a pleasure, gentlemen.
Get Press Lennox.
Ladies and gentlemen, the embassy is secure.
The hostages are free.
Press Lennox.
Diplomatic security.
Provides embassy guards… and protects against… kidnapping and assassination… and also, of course, special services… like the demonstration we witnessed here today.
Excuse me, Mr Lennox.
Somebody needs to see you right away.
My assistant will answer any questions you might have.
Thank you all very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, are there any questions I can answer?
Are you equipped with night vision attack capabilities?
That was really, really great.
Well?
The answer is no.
Press, we got another fucking alien on the loose.
Get somebody else.
Come on, buddy.
Your country calls.
Don't start waving the flag.
I'm in the private sector now.
I've got a business to run.
Look at me, Press.
You know how I got this goddamn eye.
It's a sacrifice I'd make again in a heartbeat.
But then maybe you haven't learned the meaning of sacrifice.
Listen, pal.
The last time I fought with that alien she-bitch…
I almost got myself killed.
If the government was stupid enough to make another one…
I think they can clean up the mess by themselves.
We didn't make this one.
Count me out of the search party, okay?
Where is my fucking key?
A million dollars, tax free.
Sure you won't reconsider?
Welcome to Biohazard Four.
Dr Baker!
Come out here!
Oh, my God.
Open the doors!
Somebody open the doors!
Get him away from there!
Somebody open the doors!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
You know there's no men allowed in this lab. Get away!
–Calm down, Dr Baker.
–Do you have respect for this?
–Out now, both of you!
–We have an emergency.
Okay, we'll take it outside.
–Damn well right we'll take it outside.
–Don't blow a gasket.
Don't patronize me.
We're not patronizing.
We're coming along.
Close the doors.
Laura, correct me if I'm wrong.
Are you involved in this crazy bullshit?
Dr Baker runs this facility.
She cloned the Sil embryo.
Oh. Okay, well, what should I call her?
Sil Lite?
–Her name is Eve.
–Eve. How very biblical.
We have dampened her mating instinct.
We have strictly avoided the presence of testosterone in this lab.
At least until now.
Thank you for your help in that area.
What if she gets out of there?
She's electronically tethered to a control box.
One step off the premises, and a toxic capsule explodes in her brain.
You know, it's really great to see you again… and I was hoping we'd meet under better circumstances… but, I remember Laura Baker having a little bit more soul.
Just who the hell do you think you are?
You're coming into my lab, questioning my motives!
Are you two finished?
We have a national fucking emergency on our hands!
Now, you two will work together.
That's a direct order from the Pentagon.
You killed one of these fucking alien things before. Do it again.
You heard the man.
Now the fun begins.
I went over Orinsky's phone records, and this is the last place he called.
There's a patient named
Herman Cromwell.
Turns out he taught Orinsky at Stanford.
And what exactly is Cromwell doing here?
Well, that's the interesting part.
It's classified top-secret information.
I was doing research on a Mars meteorite.
The one found in the Antarctic in '96?
Fossils in the meteorite convinced us there might have been life on Mars.
But these fossils weren't anything organic to the planet. Oh, no.
And what was the basis for that determination?
Carbon-based elements in the fossils… exist only in the Magellanic galaxy.
That's 100 million light years away.
Well, how did they get to Mars?
By my reckoning…
Mars was visited by an alien species… approximately one billion years ago.
The species was like a plague, a cancer.
It turned a thriving planet with… rivers and oceans and rudimentary plant life… into a useless hunk of rock.
When I heard they were going to send a mission to Mars…
I strongly urged the government to reconsider.
On what grounds?
On grounds that alien DNA might remain on the planet… that any human attempt to violate the planet… would result in biological contamination.
So, let me guess. They told you to shove it up your ass.
They got me fired from Stanford.
It seems the military had strategic reasons for wanting to go to Mars.
Outpost of the future, or some crap like that.
Anyway, they harassed the shit out of me.
I got into a fistfight with a Pentagon general… and broke his goddamn jaw.
That's why they stuck you in here, right?
Why do you think that Dr Orinsky called you the night that he died?
To tell me I was right.
Whatever species destroyed Mars… those poor astronauts brought down to Earth.
May God have pity on our souls.
I'll tell you one thing.
For General Lee…
to be eatin' up the road this early in the mornin'…
something's sure got
Bo and Luke all head up.
I figure it's got somethin' to do with women.
Or huntin'.
Or maybe wheels.
The temperature on Mars is approximately 225 degrees below zero.
If they brought the samples on board, the temperature thaw… could have brought the DNA back to life.
That DNA could have infected the astronauts.
This isn't the fucking X Files, goddamn it!
You are following a lead based on the interrogation… of a certified nutcase.
We got one dead N. S. E. G. doctor… we have a guy who warned the government not to go to Mars… they slapped him in a loony bin… and a seven-minute time gap during the space flight.
We need to do blood analysis on Sampas, Gamble and Ross.
Now, I know that there is a sexual quarantine of ten days… on all interplanetary missions, and the Mars quarantine ends tonight.
They could fuck the human race into extinction.
You want to be responsible for that if we don't start testing everybody now?
Test Patrick first.
Yeah.
I've been waiting to get you alone.
All the interviews, all the screaming girls… all the hoopla… gone.
Push it out of your mind.
Patrick Ross… tonight… you're mine.
I love you.
What's the matter?
I don't know.
We should hold off.
Oh, no. No, you don't.
Not tonight.
Come on, Missy.
I don't feel so good.
Relax.
Let me do the work.
There's nobody here.
Where the fuck did he go?
Let's go find the others.
I missed you up there.
I missed you so much.
It's so beautiful.
Not as beautiful as you are.
Charmer.
Take it easy, Press.
You're gonna get us killed.
Trust me, Laura.
I got a bad feeling in my stomach.
God, I missed making love with you.
Oh, my stomach!
–Oh, my God!
–Call someone!
Call for help!
Up here. Come on!
No, please!
Oh, God.
I'm gonna get a full crew.
I'm gonna get 'em over here right away.
We gotta get to the others.
Oh, this is awful.
This is just awful.
I'll take her the rest of the way.
Have a good evening.
This is nice.
You thought I lived on a tugboat.
I know what you thought.
But I got it all under control now.
Oh, you do?
Yeah, you just slide right over there.
Let me open this door.
There we go.
Hey, girl.
–Is that it?
–No, honey, that's not it.
Right there.
No, that's not it.
Oh, that's it.
What's wrong?
Dennis Gamble, we'd like you to come with us.
Man, a brother just can't get no booty.
You know what I'm sayin'?
This is no way to treat a national hero.
This is embarrassing.
What is this all about?
Look, somebody speak to me.
Hey, I'm a personal friend of Senator Judson Ross, okay?
Personal friend. I'm gonna eat your badge for breakfast.
Get your hand off my head, man.
I demand an explanation.
We'll have the test results in a few minutes.
Why am I being tested?
N. S. E. G. said I was fine.
Sit tight, son.
We'll explain everything later.
Well, it's kind of tough to sit tight, sir.
I haven't been laid in 11 months.
That's unusual for me.
Take it easy, Burgess.
Everybody deserves an explanation.
You're damn right.
And what's with all these guards?
What the hell is going on around here?
It's purely a precautionary measure.
We need a couple of minutes for the blood analysis, so just relax.
Couple of questions.
What can you tell us about the seven minutes when the Excursion lost contact?
I can't remember.
I don't know if I blacked out,
I can't remember.
When did you last speak to Anne Sampas?
At that fund-raiser the other night.
Did she act peculiar?
She seemed fine to me.
What's this all about?
Something happen to her?
You tell me.
What happened to Anne Sampas?
Tell me what happened to her!
Anne Sampas is dead.
I'm sorry, Dennis.
Yeah. Laura.
Well, the combinant DNA in Anne's body doesn't match what I found in Orinsky's.
So, it's either Gamble or Ross.
Be careful, Press.
What was the cause of death?
We don't know.
Come on.
How the hell did she die?
Sequence almost complete.
–Why are you testing my blood?
–Ten seconds till relay.
–You think I killed Annie?
–Data retrieval on-line.
–Is that what you think?
–Five seconds. Three seconds.
I didn't kill her! I swear!
Computer says normal.
There is no sign of infection.
–Go home, get some rest.
–Look, I want answers!
In due time.
We'll be in touch.
Yo, Gamble.
You know where Patrick Ross is?
Nope.
Well, if you see him, you'll let me know, yeah?
Sure.
Well, let's see what the cranial cavity has to say.
Now I'll just reach behind her ear, and we should…
God.
Patrick, no!
Want a date, mister?
I was scared, man.
This is crazy.
His whole head just grew right back like some sort of damn freak show.
The alien species can regenerate living tissue.
Aliens, little green men.
I still can't believe it.
If they knew there were aliens up there, why did they send us?
N. S. E. G. got warned but they chose to ignore it.
We think that there was some hostile DNA in the soil samples that you collected.
Something happened up there.
I can't remember exactly.
I just know it was terrible.
I'm sure that it was terrible.
The question is:
How do we proceed now?
I got guys out there all over the place looking for this kid.
Any place he might be.
We're gonna find him sooner or later.
If he's reproducing, we've got potential offspring.
I think it's safe to assume he's banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.
Well, then in less than two weeks, these offspring reach adolescence… and then they enter the chrysalis stage.
Chrysalis stage?
A cocoon which turns them into adults.
Hey, baby, turn that car around.
Hey, don't leave me.
Come on.
Hi, honey.
Baby, come back.
A serial killer may be loose in the Washington-Maryland area.
Authorities have asked the public to be extremely cautious…
when approached by strangers.
How much for number three?
Twenty an hour.
Thank you, Linda.
And now for the financial news.
Twenty, forty, sixty.
Thank you much.
Enjoy yourself.
Come in.
See what I mean, Laura?
Every so often, her rates go berserk.
Fifty agents we got out there looking for this guy.
We got nothing.
Man, how can you just touch that?
Occupational hazard.
So, you didn't see nothing, didn't hear nothing, don't know nothing?
They come and they go.
You know what I mean?
They come and they go.
Oh, that's hysterical.
Sit your ass down.
They come, they go.
You get it?
Oh, yeah, I get it.
Here you go.
Thanks.
We're wasting time.
It's been two days, and Lennox hasn't made any headway.
Maybe that's because you gentlemen won't allow us to go public.
Dr Baker, you said that Eve has telepathic abilities.
Some.
Can we send her after Patrick?
It'd be foolish to take her out of a controlled atmosphere.
There's the danger of escape.
Then we'd have two aliens loose, instead of one.
If these two were to mate, the resulting pure strain of offspring… would be unstoppable.
Well, can she tell us where he is without leaving the lab?
We've seen spiking in her biorhythms… which indicate a rudimentary connection… but half her alien genes are dormant.
Tracking Patrick is out of her league.
Dormant means asleep.
Is there any way that we can wake them up?
We could use the lab's cyclotron… to bombard her with radiation that would awaken her dormant genes.
But there is a problem.
What's that?
We make her more alien.
We increase her strength, her anger.
Her mating drive would go through the roof.
It's worth the risk.
We'll tighten security.
She is not a lab animal.
She is half-human.
Please, Baker, spare us the alien rights agenda.
Put her in the cyclotron.
And what if I refuse?
That's your prerogative.
She's gonna go in anyway.
Gentlemen.
Don't worry, Laura.
I know what they want.
I'm sorry. This is not what I intended.
It's gonna be very painful for you.
I want to help.
I'm going to radiate for 45 seconds then shut it down.
I'm connected, Laura.
I see what he sees.
He's driving down a small street.
I see two-story buildings…
a man walking a small dog.
They're stopping at a stoplight.
Okay, here we go!
I see street signs.
Gwynn's Falls and Warwick!
–Intersection of Gwynn's Falls…
–He's in a parking lot!
–What?
–Gwynn's Falls and Warwick.
Gwynn's Falls?
Where?
That's in Reservoir Hill!
There's a big supermarket!
He's going into the supermarket near Gwynn's Falls and Warwick.
Hang on to your shorts!
–He's going after a woman!
–Let's go!
How the hell did you get a drivers' license?
Where is he?
Aisle one. Fruits and vegetables!
He's in aisle one, fruits and vegetables.
We're there. Now what?
Come on, Press!
My God! It's you!
–Will you sign my Space Flakes box?
–Sure.
You got a pen?
I do.
What's your name?
Darlene.
“Darlene.”
You know a secret?
I think Space Flakes taste like shit.
–Which row?
–Cereal!
Come on, Press.
Watch it!
Where's the goddamn cereal?
Nice to meet you.
Really nice to meet you.
It's her!
Help me!
Which way?
Quick! Which way?
What she say?
They're going down some stairs.
A basement! Find a basement!
It's dark.
He wants to mate with her!
Get away!
Get up!
Shut up!
Help!
Get down!
–Damn it!
–No!
Help!
He's trying to rape her!
Man, don't shoot!
Why don't you get a motel?
Fuckin' kids.
He knows I'm tapping in.
Help! Leave me alone!
Stop!
Get off me!
Eve…
Patrick!
Go on! Get out of here!
Get out!
–Don't move, spaceman.
–Put down the gun.
Get your hands up!
Get 'em up!
What is this?
You can't deny some bugged-out stuff going on around here.
What kind of stuff?
You told me yourself you were feeling weird.
You gotta go in for tests, bro.
Sure. I don't mind going into the lab.
Open the gate.
What's going on?
Estrogen level's peaking.
It's like she's in heat.
Let me out!
Let me out!
Let's go.
Has she been given any medication?
Yes, her usual dose.
Let me out, Laura!
I'm going to double it.
Let me out!
Listen to me, Laura…
Laura!
Code 459 alert. Patrick Ross in Biohazard Four. Seal the compound!
Get out of there, Sherry!
Patrick, leave her alone!
Open the door.
I know what you're going through, and I can help you.
–Let me help you.
–Open the goddamn door.
I can't do that.
I'm sorry.
–Open it!
–I can't…
Get away from her now!
The proof is incontrovertible.
Your son was infected up in that capsule.
I'm sorry, Senator.
Jesus God.
Rest assured we'll deal with this quietly.
Medical treatment, the best doctors.
The last thing this country needs is a spectacle with a national hero being publicly compromised.
Cut the crap, Carter.
What the hell are we gonna do?
Two imperatives:
We have to find Patrick and bring him in immediately.
We have to neutralize any possibility that this could leak to the media.
The generals are very concerned.
They're gonna kill him, aren't they?
We need to find your son.
You listen to me, you arrogant son-of-a-bitch.
If you touch a hair on his head… you will rue the day you were born!
You make it very hard to help you, Senator.
Go fuck yourself!
What the hell did you think I'd do?
Stand here and let you take my son?
I'll call the goddamn President if I have to.
Listen carefully, old man.
This is way beyond the President.
Way beyond.
You wanna save Patrick?
Help us bring him in.
Damn, man! What is up?
I can't even get no play from an alien.
Some people carry a disease in their genetic code.
The possibility exists it might be passed on to their children.
Those N. S. E. G. doctors told me I had sickle trait.
It's in your chart.
You don't have sickle-cell anemia, which is why you were able to go to Mars. But you're a carrier.
Right.
Well, I guess that's why he didn't get infected up on the ship.
Right. Alien DNA cannot cope with human genetic flaws.
It has no defense against our diseases, and that might be our answer.
What could be the answer?
Alien DNA infected us.
It's about time we infected them.
What?
Patrick…
Dad, what are you doing here?
I kind of figured you'd show up here.
You always used to love this place as a child.
So did your mother.
I never could convince her to get rid of it.
Yeah, I used to come here when I was courting her.
–And after she died…
–What do you want?
Well…
First off, I'd like to apologize.
Apologize for what?
Oh, Paddy.
Don't bother.
They told me what happened… how you got infected up on Mars.
I'm sorry, Paddy… for not listening when you asked for help.
You never listened.
I'm listening now.
They're gonna kill me.
Not if I can help it.
Now, there's no way that they can find you here.
This property's still listed under you mother's maiden name.
And I sure as hell am not gonna hand you over to those Pentagon bastards.
No, sir.
I'm taking you in to Johns Hopkins… for treatment with the best.
We'll walk through that door together.
Come in with me, son.
No.
I know you won't do it for me.
But try to think of your mother.
Do it for her.
Dad, help me.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Eve…
We need your help again to find Patrick.
I'm sorry, Laura.
I can't do that.
We could just call in the National Guard.
Sorry, pal.
This is strictly a private mission.
Yeah, well, I'm a lover.
I'm not a fighter.
You haven't been one of those in 11 months.
Why you gotta bring that up?
Okay, I was a lover. I sure as hell ain't no damned bounty hunter.
This looks about right.
What?
That little, old tiny ass thing?
You ain't got no bazookas up in here?
Bazookas?
Hasn't anyone ever told you that size doesn't matter?
I mean, you can talk all that noise if you want to.
I'm taking this because I'm about to go back to Africa on somebody's ass.
I've used Dennis' blood sample as the basis for this toxin.
Of course, I have no idea whether or not this is going to work.
It's an interesting idea.
It might be the only chance we got.
But what if it doesn't work?
Well, then, my friend, we're fucked.
Get the tether!
Containment breach.
We're locked in here!
Electronic tether, armed for activation
in five, four…
three, two, one.
It's stuck.
Get back!
Security breach, code red, level four.
Colonel, there's a lot of activity below.
Keep your distance.
Let's see what's going on.
Fire!
Come on.
Get in the humvees! Let's go! Now!
You heard him! Go!
How in the hell does she know how to drive?
Her favorite show's
The Dukes of Hazard.
Fan-fuckin'-tastic.
Burgess, this is General Metzger.
Maintain your pursuit but do not engage alien escapee.
Let Press Lennox do his job.
Is that clear?
Roger. Back off, Captain.
I don't wanna crash this party until just the right time.
Stop right here.
Grab that spray canister.
Be careful with that thing.
Jesus Christ!
Welcome to the maternity ward… from hell.
Patrick's offspring.
I'm gonna go up and see if I can find
Adam and Eve.
Press, this isn't Eve's fault.
She's human too.
Like them.
What's wrong?
My DNA ain't good enough?
You let me live on that ship so I can die in this goddamn barn?
Fuck you!
Fuck all you pig motherfuckers!
I'm about to get straight
Kunta Kinte on your ass!
Dennis!
It's working!
Score one for human DNA, baby!
Why don't you get those?
I'm going up here.
Just do your thing, baby.
Die!
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Eve, get out of the way!
What the hell is going on in here?
Stay back!
Oh, my God!
Eve, I know you're in there!
Please help us!
Please, help us!
Press!
Get up! Quick!
Quick!
You killed her, you disgusting son-of-a-bitch!
Press, use my blood! Quick!
Get up!
When did you start smoking?
Just now.
I wonder if I should have this stuff analyzed.
Yeah, maybe you should.
You might turn into a sexual predator.
–Yeah, I guess that's possible.
–It'd be okay with me.
I have a drag?
–All right, one, two, three.
–Up!
–Easy.
–Got it.
Oh, now y'all show up… after we do all the work.
I wanna talk to the general.
Know what I'm saying?
Mr Gamble,
I need you to lie back for me.
–Yes, I'll be glad to.
–Nice and easy.
Looks like you're gonna be all right.
I'm fine, brother.
Be seeing you.
I hear you had a rough day.
–Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
–Well.
I've been killing aliens all night.
Know what I'm saying?
All right. The fucking thing is loose.
It's out there.
The rescue team is on its way with guns and shit.
Right now there isn't any place that's real safe.
But we stay here, in the assembly hall.
This place never had any fucking air conditioning.
If it comes in, it's gotta be through one of these doors.
Now we post a guard to let us know if it's coming.
In the meantime,you lay low, be ready and stay right... in case your time comes.
Don't you start bullshitting, Dillon.
We're gonna be trapped in here like rats.
You got a weapon? You got a blade?
Then you take it out and fucking use it!
Oh, right. So you think we're gonna stab this motherfucker to death?
No, I don't think shit! Maybe.
Maybe you'll hurt it before it takes you out, huh?
Isn't that something?
Any of you got any better ideas?
And I'll tell you, until the rescue team gets here, we're fucked!
So you better get prepared.
Well, I ain't staying here.
Well, then, suit yourself.
Fire.
Furnace.
Yeah. Let's make it to the furnace.
Holy shit.
Well, all right.
Fuckin' "A."
- Fuckin' "A."
- Fuckin' right it's right.
It's up. What do you want to say?
Tell them the whole place has gone toxic.
Are you kidding?
Then they won't come here.
The rescue team will turn back.
- Yeah. I know.
- What are you talking about?
Our only hope is that they kill this fucker.
And maybe they can do something for you.
I don't know, freeze you-
They can do an operation.
They've got the technology.
If this organism gets off the planet, it'll kill everything.
The company doesn't care about that.
They just want it for their bioweapons division, okay?
So we can't let them come here.
Fuck you.
Look, I'm sorry you've got this thing inside you, but I'm getting rescued.
I don't give a shit about these stupid prisoners, but I've got a wife, a kid.
- I'll go home on the next rotation!
- I know. This is hard.
I'm gonna send this message back, and I need that fucking code.
I'm sorry, babe. It's classified.
Listen, you stupid little shit!
This has got to be done, okay?
- There are no alternatives!
- No way!
You're not getting it!
No fucking way!
Look, it's nothing personal.
Understand?
I think you're okay.
Thanks.
Have you got any ideas?
It won't kill me.
I'm carrying the new queen.
It won't kill its future.
- Do you wanna bet this thing's that smart?
- I don't know.
Maybe I'll go find it.
See how smart it is.
- You're gonna go and look for it?
- Yeah.
I have a pretty good idea of where it is.
It's just down there... in the basement.
This whole place is a basement.
It's a metaphor. Wanna come?
Fuck me.
Where are you when I need you?
Don't be afraid.
I'm part of the family.
You've been in my life so long...
I can't remember anything else.
Now do something for me.
It's easy.
Just-
Just do what you do.
Oh.!
It won't kill me.
- What are you doing? You're supposed to be laying low.
- I have one inside of me.
The big one won't kill its own.
- What are you talking about?
- I saw it... an hour ago.
I stood right next to it.
I could've been lunch, but it wouldn't touch me.
It ran away.
It knows I'm carrying its future.
Aw, bullshit. How do you know that thing's inside you?
I saw it... on the CAT scan.
It's a queen- an egg layer.
It can make thousands more like the one we've got here.
Still sounds like bullshit to me.
- If that thing's inside you, how'd it get there?
When I was in hypersleep, I guess.
I was violated.
Now I get to be the mother.
I don't have much time... and I can't do what I should.
I need you to help me.
I need you to kill me.
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- I'm dead anyway.
I can't survive it.
But the one inside of me can generate thousands more.
It can wipe out the whole universe.
It has to die.
So somebody's gotta kill me.
Are you up to it?
You don't have to worry about that.
No speeches.
No prayers.
- What's going on?
- I don't like losing a fight.
Not to nobody, not to nothing.
- That damn thing out there has already killed half my men... got the other half scared shitless.
As long as it's alive, sister, you're not gonna save any universe.
You said you were gonna kill me.
You fucking coward!
I want to get this thing, and I need you to do it.
And if it won't kill you, then maybe that helps us fight it.
Otherwise, fuck you!
Go kill yourself.
Dillon.
We waste this thing...
- then you take care of me.
- No problem.
Quick, easy and painless.
This is the choice.
You die sitting here on your ass... or you die out there.
At least we take a shot.
We owe it one.
It's fucked us up.
Maybe we can get even for the others.
- So how do you want it?
- What the fuck are you talking about?
I'm talkin' about killing that big motherfucker!
Hold it, hold it.
The rescue team's on its way.
We could just sit this out.
- A rescue team for whom?
- For us.
They just want the beast.
You know that.
I don't give a damn what they want.
They're not gonna pick us off one by one, are they?
- I wouldn't be so sure.
- Come on. They're gonna take us home.
They're not gonna take us home.
Still doesn't mean we should go out and fight it.
- Jesus Christ! Give us a break!
- You guys have got to be fucking nuts!
- I've got a wife and kid.
- Nobody gives a shit about you, 85.
You're not one of us.
You're not a believer.
- You're a fucking company man!
- Yeah, okay.
Okay, I'm a company man and not a fucking criminal.
You keep telling me how dumb I am.
I'm smart enough not to have a life sentence on this rock!
- Fuck you!
- Piss off, 85.!
And I'm smart enough to wait for some firepower to show up... before we fight this thing.!
- Right, Morse?
- Right. Okay. Just sit here on your asses. Fine.
How about if I sit here on my ass?
No problem. Oh, I forgot.
You're the guy that's made a deal with God... to live forever, huh?
And all the rest of you pussies can sit it out too.
Me and her'll do all the fighting.
Okay. But I want the same thing as you.
I want to see it dead. I hate the fucker!
They killed my mates too!
Why the fuck can't we wait for the company and have some guns on our side?
- Why do we have to go on some fucking suicide run?
- Right.
Because they won't kill it.
They might kill you just for having seen it.
But they're not gonna kill it.
That is crazy! That is horseshit!
They will not kill us!
When they first heard about this thing... it was crew expendable.
The next time they sent in marines.
They were expendable too.
What makes you think they're gonna care about a bunch of lifers... who found God at the ass end of space?
You really think they're going to let you... interfere with their plans for this thing?
They think we're- we're crud.
And they don't give a fuck about one friend of yours... that's- that's died.
Not one.
Have you got some sort of plan?
This is a lead works, isn't it?
All we got to do is lure the fucking beast into the mold... drown it in hot lead.
All right. So how do we do that?
Yeah. What are we gonna use for bait?
- Oh, fuck!
- We're all gonna die.
The only question is when.
This is as good a place as any... to take our first steps to heaven.
The only question is how you check out.
Do you want it on your feet... or on your fucking knees, begging?
I ain't much for begging.
Nobody ever gave me nothin'.
So I say fuck that thing!
Let's fight it!
Fuck it! Let's go for it!
- Let's kick its fucking ass.
- What if it runs at us?
That's a fucking good idea.
Two, one. Open.
When was the last time you used this place?
We fired it up five, six years ago.
You sure the piston's gonna work?
There's nothing for sure in this place.
We trap it here first, then you pull the lever.
Start the piston. The piston's gonna push the motherfucker right into the mold.
Then one of the guys will pour the lead.
End of his ass. End of story.
- What if somebody screws it up?
- We're fucked. You got one chance.
One shot at it. That's all.
We'll never have time to reset it.
Now remember, when you pull the lever... for a few seconds you're gonna be trapped in here with that fuckin'thing.
You guys don't drop the ball, I won't.
You just better be right about that thing not wanting you.
Because if it wants out, that's how it's gonna go.
Through that alcove, through you.
- Where are you gonna be?
- I'll be around.
- What about the others? Where are they?
- Praying.
- You believe in this heaven shit?
- I don't know.
Me neither.
Fuck it, though.
What else have we got to believe?
You can say that for fucking sure.
What the fuck.
Fellas! I can't he-
I don't know about this shit.
Hey, guys! My door ain't working!
- What the fuck's he saying?
- I think we'd better rethink this thing!
Aaah.!
Did anybody hear anything?
Come on!
Come and get me, you fucker!
It's behind me!
- It's started.
- It's still behind me!
It's in Channel "B"!
It's still coming! Shut the doors!
Must be heading over to Channel "A"!
This thing is really pissed off!.
- Did you say "B"?
- No, "E"!
- But you said we should stay here!
- Move your fucking ass!
Morse.
Kevin!
I think I found Vincent.
Yoo-hoo! Hey, fuckface!
Come and get me!
Take your best shot!
- Kevin, where are you?
- "A-7" closed.
Over in the east wing.
Door"B-7" safe!
Aaah!
- You too?
- Yeah! Okay. Over to "E," everybody!
- Where the fuck is "E"?
- This way!
Troy. Troy? Troy, help them.
Where the hell are they going?
What about the plan?
- Look, you're immune, they're not.
- So what are we doing?
Improvising.
We're improvising.
Here, here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Here, kitty, kitty. Oh, my God.
Oh, my- You bastard!
It's coming! It's coming down!
Geez, it's coming!
It's onto us! Shut the fucking doors!
That was the plan!
Geez, it's on the fucking ceiling.!
Dillon! Anybody! This is not a drill!
Kevin! Gregor!
Where the fuck are you?
Now I'm back in "A"!
Shut. Come on.
Door 3, "F" Channel closed!
I hope.
Fuck!
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What?
- Don't hold it like that. Hold it like this.
- What the fuck-
- You'll fucking kill someone, you fucking moron!
- Ow!
Aaah!
- Morse.! Kevin.!
- Aaah.!
Gregor!
All they have to do is run down the damn corridor.
Stay here.
Where the hell is it?
Aaah!
It's coming.
Aaah!
No! Don't start the piston!
No! We have to trap it! No!
What are you doing? It's gone! No! No.
It's gone.
Okay?
Okay.
Aaah.!
- Aaah! Aaah!
- What the heck?
- Aaah.!
- All right!
Kevin! Don't struggle!
Don't move! No!
Don't struggle.
Come on. Come on, Kevin.
Come on!
Come on! Come on! Come on.
- The doors.
- It's coming!
Take the piston!
Come on. I got ya. It's all right.
It's okay. I got ya. It's okay.
It's all right, Kevin.
Kevin. Kevin.!
Leave him.
Leave him. He's dead.
We lured him.
Shit. How much time?
I'm not sure.
Four or five minutes.
But we've got to get it back in here before the piston seals this place off.
Now, let's move it!
- Help me!
- Jude!
Dillon.! Help me, Dillon.!
It's coming at me!
Goddamn it.!
Don't look back,Jude.!
Run as fast as you fucking can!
Help me!
God.! Please.! Help.!
Channel"C."
Jesus Christ!
Thank God you're here.
Warder Aaron, sir.
- Not many of us left, sir.
- Where is Lieutenant Ripley?
- Is she still alive?
- If she's alive, she's in the furnace.
She's in the lead works with the beast.
Wouldn't wait.
- Jesus Christ. You fucker.
Scared me shitless!
I thought you were the fucking beast. You fuck!
Aaah! Wanker!
Move. Come on, you bastard.
Come on.! Come on, get out of there.!
Come here.!
Ripley, we're running out of time!
Ripley, where are you?
No!
Come on. Get out of there!
- What are you doing? What the fuck is wrong with you?
- No! No!
- Let it go! Ripley!
- Yes! It's working!
- Scream.
- To the pistons.! No.!
Scream.! Let it follow us.
- Come on.!
- We got to get it in front of the piston.
Get back here.
It's following us!
Come on.! Motherfucker, come on.!
Come and get us.!
Come on.!
- Open the door!
- Come on. Come on.
Come on, motherfucker.! Come on.
Come on.! Get the door.!
- Get the door.!
- Morse!
- Now.!
- Shut it.!
Shut it, Morse!
Morse, shut that door!
- Now!
- Shut the fucking door.!
Shut it now.!
I'm going for the lead!
- Now! I'm staying.
- What about you?
Bullshit.!There's gonna be
10 tons of hot lead in there.!
- I'm telling you, I want to die!
- We got a deal!
Remember? It dies first, then you!
I'm not gonna move without you!
Now get going!
- Dillon!
- I've got to hold it here.
- What about me?
- God will take care of you now, sister!
No!
Pour the lead.
Fuck you.
Pour it, Ripley.!
Go on.! Goddamn it.!
Pour the lead, Ripley!
Pour it now!
Come on.! Come on.!
That's all you've got?
Is that all that you bite, motherfucker!
Come on!
Morse! Morse, over here!
- Ripley!
- Pour the lead!
Pour the lead!
- Aaah!
- Pour it!
All right, bug!
Ripley.! It's scalding hot.!
Hit the sprinklers.!
Douse the fucker.!
Gotcha!
Yes.!
- Don't come any closer.
- Wait. They're here to help.
Stay where you are.
- Ripley.
- Bishop.
- I'm here to help you.
- No more bullshit.
I just felt it move.
- You know who I am?
- You're a droid.
Same model as Bishop.
Sent by the fucking company.
No. I'm not the Bishop android.
I designed it.
I'm very human.
The company sent me here to show you a friendly face... to demonstrate how important you are to us-
- To me.
- You just want to take it back.
- We want to kill it and take you home.
- Bullshit.
You're wrong. We want to help.
What does that mean?
- We're gonna take that out of you.
- And keep it.
Can't allow it to live. Everything we know would be in jeopardy.
You don't want to take it back?
Ripley, time is important.
Let us deal with the mutant.
We've got a surgical bay set up on the rescue ship.
- Come with me.
- It's very quick.
Painless. A couple of incisions, you'll be out for two hours.
Then it's over.
You still can have a life.
Children.
And most important, you'll know it's dead.
Let me help you.
What guarantee do I have... once you've taken it out, you'll destroy it?
You'll have to trust me.
Please? Trust me?
No.
- What's this going to achieve?
- Aaah!
- Stop!
- Ow! Oh,Jesus!
Morse.
- Will you help me?
- What do you want me to do?
It was a mistake.!
There was no need for any of it.!
Fucking android!
I'm not a droid!
Ripley, think of all we could learn from it.
It's the chance of a lifetime.!
You must let me have it!
It's a magnificent specimen!
No pictures!
What are you doing?
No!
- Come on, you. Get going.
- Oh, fuck you!
Ash, Captain Dallas are dead.
Cargo and ship destroyed.
I should reach the frontier in about six weeks.
With a little luck, the network will pick me up.
This is Ripley... last survivor of the Nostromo... signing off.
Where do I begin?
I guess with the idea that sometimes things happen that we don't understand.
Maybe we shouldn't try to.
My dad had been assigned to inspect the military southern sector of the EPA.
My stepmother, my half-brother and I spent two months on the road with him.
It's hard being in a car with a 6-year-old and the woman who replaced your mom.
But nobody asked me what I wanted to do that summer.
I guess things do happen for a reason...
...even if you don't like what that reason is.
Come on.
Fill it up.
- You got a rest room?
- It ain't great, but we've got one.
- Not the "big old fat" part.
- Which part?
- Can I have a soda?
- No.
- I see you're from Washington, D.C.
- That's right.
Long way from home.
You're bad. You're bad.
You're scared.
Good.
They're out there.
They're everywhere!
They get you when you sleep.
They get you when you sleep, you hear?
Get out, or you'll be next!
Dad! Dad!
There's a psycho in there!
- In the bathroom?
- He's got a knife!
Sweetheart?
Maybe you should let him go in first.
He's got a gun.
Maybe you'd better come back here, honey.
There's nothing here.
There's no one in there.
You okay?
No one's there?
Marti, are you okay?
Are you all right? What did he want?
Maybe we should file a police report.
"They get you when you sleep."
I remember thinking he was crazy...
...but I also remember thinking we spend half our lives asleep.
'Morning, sir.
I'm Steve Malone. I'm with the EPA.
General Platt's expecting us.
One moment.
Follow the signs to Sector C.
I got it.
Fifty-nine. There are three doors, so it should be...
Let's see. It's this...
How'd you know that?
He's so smart. This kid of ours is so smart.
How'd you know it was that door?
Tie your shoelaces.
I'll do it.
Are you sure this is the right door?
This is it?
Great.
Andy, come on. Help me unload the car.
Come on, I'm going to get there before you do.
Andy, honey, slow down.
There are only two bedrooms.
You've got to share with your brother then.
Steve, can you give me a hand up here?
Don't work too hard.
If we'd known what was waiting for us, we would've run.
But, in the end, it had to happen.
And so it began.
- This is a restricted area, miss.
- What?
You shouldn't be here without security clearance.
What's up?
Get in the car.
I'm Jenn.
Marti.
Thanks for picking me up.
No problem. They're dicks.
What was that all about?
God knows. They always have a bug up their ass. Ignore them.
So what heinous misfortune brings you here?
A month in hell with my dad and his wife.
He's with the EPA.
EPA, cool! Hippies saving the planet.
Look at those goons.
They actually volunteered for this crap.
Can you believe it?
What are you doing here?
Not much.
My dad runs the place.
He does?
Mom? There's somebody here.
Look at this shit.
This is why my dad's an insomniac.
He's afraid she'll burn the house down in her sleep.
Mom, this is Marti. Marti, my mom.
Vodka. Want some?
Mom's an alcoholic.
The experts say that means I'll be one too.
Let's go. Come on.
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Platt.
And I don't know what's wrong with the kids.
They treat me like I'm some stranger rather than their father.
Why are you here?
What do you want?
You're young, but you're old.
Steve, you're going to get a mucho kiss.
Time for your mucho.
Carol doesn't like mucho kisses.
- Hi, honey.
- Did we wake you?
- Sorry.
- What's wrong?
I had a nightmare.
Come here. I'll give you a kiss and a big hug.
A bad dream can't hurt you.
Everybody has bad dreams, honey.
It's okay.
It's okay. Come on,
I'll take you back to bed.
What the hell was that?
Have you ever been in the military?
No, General.
Then you know absolutely nothing about biological and chemical warfare, do you?
It seems to me...
...that it'd be a lot more dangerous to move this stuff around...
...than to leave it where it is.
If these chemicals are safely stored, you have nothing to worry about.
I have nothing to worry about?
Explain that.
Come in here, Captain.
Yes, sir.
Escort Dr. Malone around the base.
Show him what he needs to see.
Let him take samples and run tests.
Then do whatever you have to to expedite his departure.
Mr. Malone?
Good afternoon, sir.
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.
Can you give us some space?
I want to talk to him.
I'm Major Collins, head of the base medical corps.
Hold on.
I wanted to meet you...
...and extend my cooperation to you personally.
Thank you.
I'm very interested in the effects exposure to these chemicals can have on people.
Effects?
You got a lot of chemicals on this base.
They're all pretty toxic.
Effects? Physically, they could be devastating.
Not physically. I'm referring to psychological effects.
I'm not following you.
Can they affect brain patterns?
Can they interfere with chemo-neurological processes?
Can they foster psychoses, paranoias...
...narcophobias?
I'm a chemist, not a psychiatrist.
I don't know.
Simply...
...can they alter one's view of reality?
Let me be frank.
I'm seeing people at the infirmary...
...who are exhibiting...
...extreme delusional fixations.
People...
...afraid to sleep.
People afraid to...
...deal with family members.
Afraid of them.
Exhibiting...
...paranoia about others...
...about other people's identities.
People afraid of themselves.
Suddenly, I got a camp full of very displaced people.
I don't know what you're seeing, but it's not the PCBs.
That phenomenon is not part of the symptomology.
Keep me up to date on your research.
I'm worried about these... people.
Better take a vacation, Doc.
We have equipment for Dr. Malone.
Come in.
What are you doing in there?
Delivering the boxes.
Are you through?
Good.
Very good.
Good work.
Very good work.
Very good.
Okay, all done?
Everyone hold your picture up.
Very good.
Good.
Very good.
"When it's over, let's do it again."
Hey, little man!
Hey, little man!
- What are you doing?
- Running away.
What are you running from?
The bad people.
The bad people?
Come, we'll take you home.
- Your folks in the military?
- No.
Sector C, Petey.
There's my bike!
That's your bike? Okay, pull it over.
Sure this is the house?
What's going on?
Found him wandering around.
We figured he was lost.
You should be in day care.
I hate that place.
What happened?
They all had the same pictures.
They tried to make me go to sleep.
Tried to make me go to sleep.
Sorry to have troubled you.
No trouble.
What're you doing home?
Are you an MP, or something?
No, I'm a chopper pilot.
Thanks for bringing him home.
Maybe I'll see you around.
Where?
Top Gun? It's on Route 8.
It's the only club around.
Name's Tim.
Marti.
- No problem at all.
- Thanks.
Take care.
- Thank you.
- No problem.
Appreciate it.
Thanks very much.
All right. Take care.
- Say, "Thank you."
- Thank you.
What's this about, "The kids don't like me?" How could they not?
He's the new kid.
It's his first day at school.
The faster he goes back, the faster he'll make friends.
- Hi.
- Hey, chick.
Get your coat. Let's go.
Where are we going?
Out. Anywhere. Anywhere but here.
Jenn Platt, Carol.
I'm sorry, I didn't realize you knew...
Steve!
Marti has a friend here. Want anything?
- We don't have much.
- I'm fine.
We have milk, orange juice...
I could make lemonade. Or tea.
We have mint.
- Jenn Platt. Nice to meet you.
- Steve Malone.
Popcorn?
- I'm fine.
- Did you say "Platt"?
Yes, the general's daughter.
I came by to take Marti and show her around.
Where?
The base. The rec center.
When are you planning to be home?
Done! Let's go.
But do be home by 12:00. That's all I ask.
Just be home by 12:00.
Nice meeting you.
That's a really interesting outfit you've got on.
- Here?
- This is it.
I don't have any ID.
Don't get your panties in a bunch.
Just come.
Oh, man, where is everybody?
Hey, ladies.
You want to dance?
Lambada?
Look who's here.
I don't believe my eyes. Jenn.
Where is everybody?
Word get out that you'd be here?
They heard your old man was coming.
Yeah, to court-martial your ass.
- This is Pete and...
- Marti.
You know each other?
We met earlier.
When? You just got here yesterday.
What do I do to get a drink here?
You want a drink? Have a drink.
Come here.
You can have anything.
You know that.
This is romantic.
Now what?
Let me dazzle you with my stick work.
Or not.
I mean, let's play some pool.
All right, let's go.
Sit down.
How are you?
Good.
How's your brother?
He's kind of weirded out.
Can I get you a drink?
Yeah. I'll have whatever he's having.
Yeah, right.
Hey, Melissa, can I get a couple of beers, please?
Andy's a nice kid.
Do you want him?
Do I want him?
Shit!
What's wrong?
- I know that guy.
- What guy?
He scared me.
What'd you do to her?
What are you talking about?
In the gas station.
Your girlfriend's had too much to drink.
You should take her home.
Oh, Tim.
It's okay.
Guess I made a mistake.
I was 7 when she died.
I didn't expect my dad to marry again.
Stupid, huh?
You must really miss her.
What was your mother like?
You always remember the good things about people.
I miss her.
Did you ever play, "I Never"?
What's that?
You put your hands up...
...and the object is to make the other guy drop all his fingers down.
So, if I were to say...
..."I've never been to Mars"...
...then neither of us put our fingers down,
'cause we haven't been there.
But if you said, "I never wore a dress"...
...then I'd have to put a finger down.
Get it?
- Okay, go ahead.
- You start.
I've never eaten Brussels sprouts.
I've never been in a helicopter.
I've never tried to give my kid brother away.
I've never shot anyone.
When?
Kuwait.
I never hide my feelings.
- What's the matter?
- It's Mommy!
- What about Mommy?
- Her head came off. She's dead!
- There's Mommy, right there.
- She's not my mommy!
- What happened?
- He had a bad dream.
It's okay. I'll put you to bed.
No! That isn't my mommy!
Wait!
Wait!
Take your brother inside.
Take him inside. Do it.
- Are you aware she's underage?
- No, sir.
You aware you're giving booze to an underage girl?
You weren't aware of that?
- No, sir.
- No?
- That's funny?
- No, sir.
Don't come here anymore.
Come on.
I'm not lying, Marti!
Nobody said you were.
I had nightmares when I was your age.
They go away all by themselves.
She's not Mommy, Marti.
She is your mommy. She loves you a lot.
My mommy died.
- I don't want to talk. I'm angry.
- Dad, please.
I can't trust you.
You're drunk and an hour late.
I'm not drunk.
And you've known him 100 years...
I had one lousy beer and came home half an hour late!
Big deal! I'm not a fucking 10-year-old!
Don't use that language.
You don't talk that way to me.
Why? It's the only time you'll listen.
- That's not true.
- Bullshit!
You never listen to me. Why do I bother?
Wait.
Wait! Wait!
Would you stop kicking the table, please?
Thank you.
I can't wait until I'm 18.
Why? Think you won't be my daughter?
I'll still be your daughter.
I just won't have to listen to you.
You don't listen to me now.
If you want to go so bad, you don't have to wait until you're 18.
Just go now.
You'd like that.
Then it'd just be you three.
Want to go back to day care, or stay home with Mommy?
My mommy's dead.
Okay. Come down.
Be very careful with that stuff.
It's very toxic.
Watch out!
Get an ambulance and a clean-up crew.
Get back. We'll take care of him.
What the hell's the matter with you?
Get an ambulance!
Jesus, what is that?
Nothing.
Shit!
Is Jenn here?
Come on up.
Try this.
Taste it.
- It's water.
- That's right.
There's always vodka in this glass.
Maybe she went on the wagon.
If she were on the wagon, she'd be climbing the walls.
I'm leaving now.
Where are you going?
We're playing bridge at the Smythe's.
What?
She doesn't know how to play bridge.
Sir, there's been an accident in the storage warehouse.
Initial reports indicate camp personnel have been injured.
We're preparing a written summary.
I'll have it for you in an hour.
Thank you, Captain.
I took it off the suit fibers.
I ran the entire herbicide screen.
I still don't know what it is.
I'll send you the sample tomorrow.
Give it the full GCMS.
I'm telling you, I've never seen anything like this in my life.
Ever.
It scares me. It's not blood.
I don't know what the hell it is.
Run a protocol...
...and get back to me quickly.
I want to go home.
Dad promised as soon as he's done with his tests, we'll leave.
It's going to be okay.
It happens when you sleep.
What does?
You die.
Tub's full.
Hurry, it's going to overflow.
Get in bed.
I said, get in bed.
Night-night.
Is your back sore?
Want me to give you a massage?
Yeah, lie down.
Lie down.
Marti's really mad at me.
She'll get over it.
You'll see.
Wake up in the morning...
...be another day.
Be like none of it happened.
She'll be okay.
It'll be over.
I love you.
I love you too.
Just let go.
Daddy! No! Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!
Wake him up! Get him dressed!
759, Sector C.
We got to go! We got to go right now!
- Listen to me.
- You don't understand! We got to go!
Go where?
Go! What're you talking about?
Steve, this is important.
Go where?
That's right. Go where?
Are you listening?
What happened in your room is not an isolated incident.
It is happening everywhere.
- What?
- Where would we run?
Where are you going to go?
Where are you going to run?
Where are you going to hide?
Nowhere.
Because there's no one like you left.
That's right.
Oh, God.
That's right. That's good.
You're listening now.
Now I know you're frightened, Steve.
I know you're scared. That's okay.
I understand that you're confused.
Let me tell you something, Steve.
All that anger, all that fear and confusion...
...it's going to melt away.
It's going to go away.
It's going to go away. Go to sleep.
Wake up. It's very simple.
In the morning, you'll feel wonderful.
- We'll be together. We're connected.
- What's happening?
We're together.
Your fear. That's good. Let it go.
Get away from me!
Get away from my kids!
This way!
Go on, we'll cover you!
Move it out, mister!
What's all that noise?
Petey, those are gunshots.
Pete, where the fuck are you?
What's going on?
Sit down, Timbo.
What the hell's going on?
Hey, Justin.
Go to sleep, Timbo.
What is this, a joke?
Just go back to bed.
What's with the needle?
What is this?
What're you doing?
I told you to go to bed, didn't I?
Take my watch.
I gotta try to find us some help.
Be back in a couple of hours.
You'll be okay.
You'll be okay.
Do what your sister tells you.
Where are you going?
To find us a way out of here.
Just be very quiet, okay?
Don't worry, sweetheart.
I won't let anything happen to you.
I need an outside line.
Sorry, Major Collins, all the lines are busy at present.
Stay where you are.
I'll keep trying and call you back.
How do you know my name?
I didn't tell you my name!
How the hell do you know my name?
Major.
Back!
It's me. It's Steve Malone.
Remember me?
I know who you are. You...
...stay... back.
You gotta help me.
No time left. My kids are in danger.
My wife is...
Do you have a car?
Please. Come on.
It's too late to run.
It's too late!
They've taken the base!
All we can do is wait until they come and then...
The keys.
The keys.
They'll follow you.
They'll follow you.
That's how they work.
We gotta stand up and fight back now!
I've got a gun for you.
I've got a gun for you too.
We'll give them hell!
We'll give them hell.
We'll show them what the human race is really made of.
Want some?
Stay with me, Doctor. We have to go.
Now.
You can't sleep. You gotta make sure you don't sleep.
Come on.
Please.
Please.
The head cabbage.
Well, well, well, well, well.
Be realistic, Major.
Put it down.
Not before I unload a few into you onion-heads.
Relax, Major. Take it easy.
You disappoint me.
You're a man of medicine.
You're supposed to preserve life, not take it.
You bastard!
You call what you are "life"?
I know who you are!
- I know who you are!
- Do you?
Amphetamines.
I know what happens when you bastards catch somebody sleeping.
Want a few?
Look what your fear has done to you.
Can't you see?
When all things are conformed...
...there'll be no more disputes.
No conflicts.
No more problems.
Abandon yourself and join us.
There are hundreds...
...even thousands of us here.
We've traveled light years throughout the universe...
...always surviving, growing stronger.
Because we've learned...
...it's the race that's important...
...not the individual.
The individual's always important.
- Only unity guarantees survival.
- So you must join us.
- The human race is doomed.
- Accept it.
It's a better way.
- Stay back!
- It's a matter of survival.
Stay back! Stay back!
I'm warning you to stay back!
Doctor...
...put the gun down.
You'll never get my soul.
Never.
"Nobody likes us
"Everybody hates us
"Going to the garden...
"...to get worms
"Long, thin, slimy ones
"...short, fat, juicy ones...
"...itsy-bitsy, fuzzy worms
"First, you bite the head off
"Then you suck the juice out
"Then you throw the rest away"
Everybody okay?
I found us a way out of here.
Dad, they're everywhere!
Where are we going?
I know what I'm doing. Don't worry.
Just don't show any emotion.
They can be fooled.
I know where I'm going.
I know exactly what I'm doing.
Where are you going?
Stop!
Let go! Let go!
Shit! Shit!
Don't make me hurt you. Just calm down.
What's going on?
Let her go!
Leave her alone!
Shoot him! Shoot him!
- What's happening?
- He's not my father!
It's not him!
Shoot him!
- Just back up. Back up. Put it away.
- Don't listen!
- Shoot him!
- What do you mean?
Stay back.
It's not my dad! He killed my father.
- Put it away.
- It's not my dad!
- They killed my father!
- Just relax...
- Shoot him!
...and put it away.
What are you doing?
Marti, let's go.
Come on, Marti!
There's my chopper.
It's too dangerous, so I'm going alone.
Watch for me. I'll land it over here.
Be ready to make your move when I touch down.
We'll get out of here.
Ready for that ride I promised you?
All right.
Just act like one of them.
Be careful.
Nobody believed me.
I figured you'd try a bird.
What do you mean?
You know what I mean.
Now we're all the same, Petey.
So what are you running from?
Who's running?
I've got orders.
We're all one happy family now.
Happy?
What's that?
You're wasting my time, Lieutenant.
They're waiting for light support.
Hey, Timbo...
...just so you know...
...I fucked your girlfriend.
Okay, let him at the bird.
- What are you doing?
- No! Don't!
You're making a mistake!
Don't!
Please.
Wake up!
Wake up!
Try and wake up! Come on!
Camp Perry, Ohio.
West Point, New York.
Fort Knox, Kentucky.
You can do this, Marti.
You're doing fine. Just walk with me.
Fort Monroe, Virginia.
Fort Bliss, Texas.
Where's Andy, Tim?
He's got to be in there.
I didn't see him.
He wasn't in there.
My chopper's right up there.
I'm not leaving without my brother.
We'll get help, then come back for him.
Do what you want, but I'm not leaving without him.
Didn't I tell you this place was a freak show?
Where are you going?
We got work to do.
I saw Andy. He's looking for you.
Where?
Marti, don't leave me!
Marti, wait, don't go!
Don't leave me here!
Go! Go!
Andy, don't! What are you doing? No!
Get him off me!
Andy, what are you doing?
Throw him out!
Throw him out!
He's not your brother!
Throw him out!
Should we go after them?
Let them go. No one'll believe them.
I'm sorry, Marti.
They said nobody would believe us.
Who could believe such a crazy story?
I could hardly believe it myself.
They had destroyed everyone I loved.
Our reaction...

Revenge, hate, remorse, despair, pity...

How I hated them.

[Man Narrating]
Careful, Otto.
Don't spill it.
Hold your horses.
Children, heed the warnings
of your parents.
Peril awaits the incautious wayfarer...
and strews grief
where laughter once played.
##[Woman Vocalizing]
Think twice.
I'm sure you can live without that.
Don't get wet.
Nature has built for us
a beautiful world.
Allow yourself to drink in
its wonder safely.
Paths must be climbed with
the sure-footedness of a mountain goat,
but beware your skill at climbing.
The skill assures nothing.
A heedless heart
can be lured to dangerous heights,
and a sudden ice film...
or a single wobbly stone
can pry you loose from the path...
[Screaming]
And serenade you with the whistling wing
of the death plummet.
[Screaming Continues]
Then there is always the avalanche...
when the snow relaxes its grip on the slope...
and is dragged downward
under its own crushing weight.
The slightest sound...
- [Sneezes]
- Or any false move by anyone...
can trigger these deadly landslides
and sweep all into oblivion.
Guard yourself and your neighbor
against making that fatal sound.
Be vigilant.
Do you have your binoculars? Use them.
Silence. Propriety.
While clutched to its mother's bosom,
a baby in Tolzbad once lost an eye...
when a carelessly unpinned brooch
pierced right through the baby's eyelid.
As if infected with this carelessness,
the same baby, by then a grown swan feeder,
lost his other eye
when he got too close to a clock.
Caution is not enough for the blind.
It wasrt long before the swan feeder, too,
heard the loud song of the wind.
You should never hold a baby's face near an open pin.
[Narrator]
Once, an avalanche,
started by a single bleat of a lamb,
uncovered all the graves in a cemetery.
The dead had been
so well preserved by the ice,
long dead youthful husbands
were revisited by their brides,
now withered and old,
and young parents by their old children.
Henceforth, before burial,
- all the dead had their hearts perforated
with the long nail of the coroner...
- [Hammering]
Just to be on the safe side.
And ever since,
to prevent a repetition of the tragedy,
all farm animals
have had their vocal chords severed.
Absolute silence is required of us.
Children, sit still.
The noise of your play must be muted
until you comprehend the risk you represent.
Keep a lid on it. Don't be rash.
I'll do it.
Don't stand so close to the walnut tree.
You'll catch a chill.
Don't put too much pepper on it.
After long research, I've discovered
the existence of mountain nodes...
rare and extremely hard to find places,
quirks of the mountain ranges,
where all sounds sent out
are perfectly canceled by their own echoes.
From here,
within these acoustic shadows,
no dangerous noises can escape
to unloose the crushing mass of snows.
Here cautious vent
can be given to stifled impulses.
We can sing, laugh and cavort.
But I must stress,
even though safety is assured
by the acoustic laws of the ranges, we must not believe ourselves safe.
For always there is the wild, uncontrolled sound of nature.

Herr Trotta, I was thinking.
Perhaps you shouldn't say what you're thinking.
I can't help myself.
I'd like to ask you for Klara's hand... in marriage.
We've known each other since birth.
Well, what do you think, Sigleinde?
Should we say yes?
Poppa, what do I know about such things?
Johann, you have my consent.
Poppa!
[No Audible Dialogue]
Come, Sigleinde.
I do believe we're late.
[Sigleinde]
For what, again?
I thought I'd die.
Your eyes are so blue.
Johann, watch your tongue.
It's true.
You're as fresh and sound
as a rose.
Oh, Johann,
it's magic that binds me to you.
Ours is a magic that...
Curious feature of life in this valley:
When two people who are in love speak to each other, however softly, their voices carry for miles.
[Johann]
Forever.
Till tomorrow, Johann.
Don't lose your way.
Don't stay up too late, darling.
You need your sleep.
I'll never let you out of my sight.
Don't forget to wear your sweater at the crevasse.
Good night.
Onufrij has made lamb tonight.
Would you like to set the table?
Watch how we set the table at butler school, Mother.
You can time us if you'd like.
If we make any mistakes, feel free to cane us.
As Frau Teacher says, that's how you learn to be more careful next time.
Why such a good mood, Johann?
Only because
Klara and I are going to be married.
And when are you going to make your mother happy?
Sigleinde would marry you.
There shall be dancing.
Lower the sheepskins.
[People Chattering, Laughing]
Listen to that noise outside.
The villagers from Setsburg are at it again.
One of these days, they pay dearly
for the shouting and carrying on.
God forgive me.

Breakfast, children.
Are you ill, Mother?
No. Why do you ask?
Look. There's my hat.
It must have fallen on the floor.
You're the one that looks ill.
Let me feel your forehead.
Sit down. Rest yourself.
Tea is almost ready.
Look, Johann.
This napkin fold is called the lotus.
Not on the table, Grigorss.
But diligence is a butler's ally.
That's what Frau Teacher says.
[Swallowing]
Herr Bloomfeld came along today.
His dog ran away.
A dog needs a good, strong chain.
Johann, you forgot to change the air.
Sorry.

Hurry up, Johann.
We'll be late for butler school.
Come on, Johann.
[Mother]
Don't talk to strangers.
[Locks Clicking]
Good morning, children.
[All]
Good morning, Frau Teacher.
Today I have to talk to you about something very sad.
You all know about the tragic accident that happened on the... on the Eiger north wall in Setsburg.
Some of you even saw the one who was rescued.
The other one no longer lives.
He will not come back to his parents.
He will no longer enjoy the beautiful things that life, which is so very, very precious, may have had in store for him.
Never... gamble... with... life.
You are butler students.
It is hoped you will be punctual, faithful, diligent, well mannered, polite, earnest, hardworking, zealous, always obedient while you are with us.
Your appearance is, uh, inoffensive,
and I trust your conduct
will be so too.
Polish... until you can see your own reflection.
Pluck those nose hairs, Fritz.
But I must insist you make an effort
to restrain all your movements.
Loud voices and clumsy feet
are not in fashion here and never shall be.
Master has an occluded bowel.
Alert Herr Doctor Schmidt at once.
Try to see if you might find it
in your power... to always... set foot upon the floor with the utmost care.
The Count is exceedingly... sensitive about this.
Wrong.
Clean yourself and try again.
Be quick, cautious, alert,
precise and silent.
I also recommend that your comportment... remain cold and serene.
Here are the bodies of those foolish climbers.
What is the lesson?
[Both]
Never gamble with life.
Kurt.
She needs a light for her cigar.
Correct.
Hanz!
Remove the serving dish.
Correct.
Sepp.
Slide in her chair?
Correct. Ferdl?
Her fork has fallen on the floor.
Correct. Grigorss.
Plump the seat cushion.
Correct. Johann?
Remove her nightgown.
Wrong. You are butler, good for naught... save bed making, sand strewing.
Steady, man.
Kurt.
You're thinking too much of your Klara.
Groom his mustache.
Correct. Hanz?
The napkin is folded improperly.
Frau Teacher is very strict.
Brother, where are you going?
Klara's coming here to meet you.
Tell her I'm ill.
Tell her whatever you like.
[Animals Hooting]
[Trotta] No, I don't.
[Klara]
Yes, I will.
Easy now.
Oh, Poppa.
Watch your step.
[Wind Howling]
[Birds Squawking]
[Squawking Continues]
[Wings Swoop]
[Panting]
This is from Johann.
Eggs break very easily.
You'd best give it to Sigleinde.
Where is Johann?
J... Johann is ill.
The passions grow on high mountains... and fling their red blossoms to the storm.
Perhaps the boy has mountain fever.
It begins innocently enough,
with dreams of mountains,
a peak round as a plump knee...
or a crest like a frosted bosom,
white as goats'milk.
Who can resist
the temptation to climb?
Into the folds one swoons.
The rocks will catch you
in a piercing embrace.
There is something terrible
about mountains.
When the wind passes over
anything else in nature...
long grass or flowers...
there is a brief agitation,
an anxious stirring,
and then the wind passes away
as if it had never been.
With mountains, it is different.
Look at the ripples,
wrinkles in the rock.
The fearful passage of the wind
is etched in the very stone, like a scream that never ends.
[Mother's Voice]
Johann. Johann.!
You better put your name
on your new toothbrush
before some accidents happen.
[Tapping Drinking Glass]
[Animals Chirping, Screeching]
Franz, this is your father.
I have come back.
Are you still alive?
Nod if you are real.
I hear you nod.
Death has sharpened my ears, but for some reason it has left me blind, just as in life.
I cannot see what death is like, but this is what I know.
Sounds of swans, wings beating ceaselessly above my head, night winds blowing against my cheeks.
Most of the time,
I remember nothing and have no thoughts.
Then a memory strays into my head, like a lost traveler, famished and pleading.
I dreamt I saw your footprints... in the wet part of the underworld.
Why your footprints, Franz?
You, who have never walked.
I heard your footprints speak to me
in your voice.
You, who have never spoken.
I followed you here in my dream.
Am I awake?
I know that I am in your room and that you see me.
Your brother's heart...
It is full of sores.
He dreams of his mother like a bridegroom.
He is confused.
His virginity has become a curse.
One can get lost in love.
When I remember anything,
I remember how much
I wanted your mother's kisses.
My desire still lives in this house, unsatisfied.
And your mother's desire, also unfulfilled...
Johann has breathed it in.
Warn him!
I'm counting on you to warn him.
Warn him.
Warn him.
[Echoes Softly]
Warn him.
[Animals Chirping, Screeching]
[Birds Chirping]
Look at that butterfly.
How innocent it is.
Let us strive for purity in everything, even after our wedding.
Purity sickens me.
You can be pure for both of us.
Johann!
Klara.
Suppose that the sounds of angels singing hymns to our virginal love... was in reality a choir from the deepest pit of hell.
What are you saying?
You frighten me.
Forgive my raving.
I have not been sleeping well.
We live at a very high altitude.
You need rest.
Keep your mind fixed on goodness, as it always has been, and all will be well.
Here.
Let me smooth your brow.
How our feelings play with us.
[Liquid Bubbling]

I learned today
I'm first in my class.
Count Knotkers always hires the best of the graduating butlers to enter his service.
Can you imagine me waiting tables and lighting fires in that castle?
Quite an honor.
Of course, thejob
would have gone toJohann,
were he still with us.
I'm sorry to mention his name.
One can't live in the past.
I must put all that behind me.
[Bell Clanging Softly]
I'd like to share my income with your family.
I realize your father's experiments, however valuable, bring in very little money.
If you'd allow me to do this small thing...
Thank you, my friend.
That won't be necessary.
I've accepted a job in the mines.
I begin work this afternoon, as a matter of fact.
You in the mines?
Why not?
I'm as strong as any man in the village.
Being in darkness all day seems strangely comforting to me now.
Perhaps I could accompany you to work someday.
You just have.
Ah, there's Poppa!
Hello, Grigorss.
Klara,
I do wish you'd reconsider.
Don't be silly, Poppa.
Mining's just like chopping firewood.
Besides, in the mines you can sing without starting an avalanche.
Very well. The least I can do is escort you down on your first day.
Don't forget your helmet.
[Bell Clanging Softly]

##[Chorus Vocalizing]
- What will you be doing today?
- Oh, your sister and I will take our usual walk in the village.

I'm Grigorss Bernoltz, the new butler.
I'm Herr Schmidt.
Wipe your feet before you come in.
I hope that's a clean shirt.
[Shoes Scuffing]
Does the Count wish to see me before I begin?
The Count must never be disturbed.
If you do not stay out of his way, you will have cause to regret it.
A word of caution.
Don't, under any circumstances, go into this room.
No, Herr Schmidt.
Only the nuns are allowed in here.
Do you understand?
Yes, Herr Schmidt.
I think so.
Only the nuns.
This is the white bedroom.
The Count's mother rests here.
Since her illness, nothing, absolutely nothing of hers has been touched by unconsecrated hands.
Are your bowel movements regular?
Yes, Herr Schmidt.
I'm glad to hear it.
[No Audio]
[Klara]
Poppa, I'm home... from the mines.
[Chuckling]
Oh, how funny you look.
Poppa said you'd come home dirty.
He laughed when I asked if you'd look like a chimney sweep from my fairy book.
Poppa laughed?
Look. I have something to show you.
Poppa bought me this today.
He didn't want the sun to burn my fair skin.
He spoils us so.
Doesrt he, Klara?
Come down to the river with me.
Right now?
I need your help to clean off this dust.
[Water Flowing]
Come in.
It's too cold.
Take off your dress
and come in.
I can't clean myself.
What if someone sees us?
It's dark.
We swam together hundreds of times as children.
Don't frustrate me.
Only for a minute.
Don't splash me.
I won't.
Start with my face.
Rub hard.
It's too deep here.
The rock is slippery.
You silly girl!
I can't swim.
I'm getting out.
Clean my face!
[Trotta]
Is that you, Klara?
Cover your eyes, Poppa.
I'm helping Klara scrub herself.
This is most imprudent.
Klara, what is the meaning of this?
There's so much grime, Poppa.
I needed help.
Come to the house when you've finished, and we will discuss the matter.
The Count has summoned you to his chamber.
What have you done?
Nothing.
You must have committed some grave offense.
The Count never sees anyone.
[Gong Sounds]
Let a little light in.
So, you disappoint me.
I'm very sorry, Count Knotkers.
Raise your head.
I can't see you.
You look like you've killed someone.
L... I feel so much shame at having displeased you.
It was such an honor to be chosen as one of your servants.
My poor mother is overjoyed... that I'm working here.
Am I to be dismissed?
Please calm yourself.
I was teasing you
about being disappointed.
You've done nothing wrong.
I wanted to ask you
about your mother.
My mother?
Yes. Uh, my mother is dead,
as you must know.
We were very close.
She was a great lady.
It was difficult for me to think of
anyone else while she was alive.
You must know
that feeling.
Yes, I do.
But now... she's passed away.
Is your mother still as beautiful as I remember?
It's a difficult question for a son to answer.
I knew her very well, in my rather devil-may-care youth.
Has she spoken of me to you?
Only as a man to be looked up to.
My brother and I were taught to include your name in our night prayers.
I'm pleased to hear it.
You know, I've been shut up
in this castle for too long now.
I long for some companionship.
The villagers dream of capturing a glimpse of you.
As they should.
Perhaps I will pay a visit
to your mother one day soon.
For old time's sake.
It would be a very great honor.
I hope she can bear up in your presence.
She does not handle excitement very well.
Yes, she is rather... delicate.
Well, convey my regards to her.
That's all. You may go now.
[Whispers]
8:00. Lights out.
Trouble once again, my faithful Franz!
You must act this time to save your mother from a terrible fate.
A former rival of mine will be entering my house.
Yes. It is my house, whether anybody remembers my place here or not.
This rival will speak words of love to your mother, and she will drink them in eagerly, helplessly, until she is mad for his touch, for his breath upon her neck.
I see his cloak draped over her nakedness... and her forgetting everything but tight, pinching fingers,
his greedy biting.
She will leave this house for good and go to him.
You will never have her forgiveness.
And you will be sealed up
in this attic forever.
So act now, Franz,
while there is still time.
Can I help you roll out the dough, Mother?
I'm making gooseberry pie.
My favorite.
And a brimming mug of cow warm milk to go with it.
Tell me about your day... at the castle.
I performed all my duties with grace and decorum.
Don't boast, Grigorss.
It will make you careless.
And stop eating those gooseberries.
What would you say if I told you
I had an audience with the Count?
I'd say it was impossible.
You're full of secrets, Mother.
He says he knows you.
You have spoken to him.
I was a little troubled by his way of talking about you.
How do you mean?
Oh, I don't know.
Familiar.
Almost flirtatious.
I realize he's the Count, but you are my mother, and with Father and Johann gone,
I am your protector as well.
What did he say about me?
You really loved Poppa, didn't you?
What a foolish question.
It's not like you to have doubts about me.
I never doubt you,
Mother, only...
What?
I'm afraid to ask you this.
Then perhaps you should think of it better.
Why do we keep Franz in the attic?
Why won't you let us mention him in your presence?
[Breathing Heavily]
I have a hair ball in my throat.
[Whimpers]
I'll swallow it.
[Bird Squawking]
Franz.
Father.
Mother.
[Woman Whispering]
[Knotkers]
I stumbled around inside myself
again and again.
[Man Continues, Indistinct]
Zenaida. Zenaida.
Let me say that name.
That beautiful name.
Zenaida.
Zenaida.
Zenaida.
My mother disapproved
of our being together.
I couldn't go against her wishes.
But now that she's at rest,
I'm free... free to do what I like.
- Do I speak too boldly?
- Oh, let me be bolder still.
The night of my sors tragic accident,
I dreamt that you came into my room... and kissed me once sweetly on my breast.
Your face was still of that handsome young man I longed for.
Oh, how many years, in spite of all my troubles... and heartache.
I cherished that dream, dearest Count, as a sign from heaven
God has not forsaken me.
Why did you marry that wretched swan feeder?
I cringe at the thought of him sleeping beside you.
If you only knew what I endured with him.
My first child,
Franz...
he smelled like my husband,
even as an infant.
I couldn't nurse him.
I couldn't nurse him
without thinking for a moment
how much I hated my life.
He never spoke.
He fell ill and had to be confined to his sickroom.
I gave him to my husband.
"Feed him with your swans,"
I told him.
[Whimpers]
But my other sons,
Johann and Grigorss...
they are yours.
At least in spirit.
When I conceived them, my thoughts were only of you.
I cried out to you, silently,
while my husband
blindly and clumsily labored.
Oh, my darling.
Let me give Grigorss a title then.
And let us wed as soon as possible.
We've wasted half of our lives.
[Jingling Softly]
Where are you
leading me, Daughter?
You'll see, Poppa.
Put your foot just there.
Here?
Just there.
Is Sigleinde still behind me?
Yes, Poppa.
I told her to be as quiet as a snowflake.
Take off your blindfold.
Take off my blindfold.
My Lord.
Look at this.
What is this place?
It's my mountain hideaway, Poppa.
For weeks I've been bringing things here.
I want to make a little home for the two of us... a home away from home, where we can visit and be close and tell each other stories.
You could eat horsehair at this little table.
Where's Sigleinde?
I want a special place, just for the two of us.
Please, Poppa.
Grant me this one request.
I can't think about this right now.
What have you done with your sister?
She's walking in the forest.
Here. Let me show you my treasure chest and the quilt I made for you.
No. She's lost.
I must find her.
Sigleinde.
Sigleinde.
Sigleinde.
Sigleinde.
Imagine. Only two weeks ago your were lighting fires in the basement... and washing goblets in the kitchen.
Now you're wearing the uniform of a high official.
Don't rub your eyes, or this may all disappear.
How I wish it were that simple to end a nightmare.
[No Audible Dialogue]
[Clinks]
Very recently,
Grigorss Bernoltz... joined the ranks of my servants.
He dreamed, like most servants dream,
of a long career
of faithfully discharged duties.
Tonight Grigorss removes his butler's livery... and takes seat at my right hand.
From now on, he shall be called...
Coronet Counselor
Grigorss von Knotkers.
I will bestow on him all the privileges of a firstborn son,
and I expect all of you
to regard him as my son...
and treat him with the same degree
of respect and deference...
that you owe to me.
His mother, Zenaida,
has agreed to be my wife.
This dinner has been arranged...
to make a public announcement
of our engagement.
If we seem overly hasty to complete the nuptials, well, so be it.
When is it more fitting for a man and a woman... to be impetuous than when they are in love?
Grigorss, please join my side.
Your mother and I would like your blessing on our union.
I'm sure you won't withhold it.
Do I have permission to speak?
[Knotkers] My dear son,
you no longer need permission.
Very well.
Since I've been granted a title,
I'm within my rights to challenge you to a duel, tomorrow on Mitterwald's Tongue above the clouds.
Are you mad?
Perhaps this will make your decision easier.
This is for shaming the memory of my father... and attempting to lead my too easily tempted mother from the path of virtue.
Get your coat, Mother.
Our business here is complete.
Grigorss, don't turn around.
I can't bear to look at you.
In the morning, I'll be dead.
Then you won't have to.
Let me tell you what you've done tonight.
You've plunged a dagger into your mother's heart.
You've ripped my skin off and poured hot lead into my veins.
I'm sorry for any... inconvenience
I may have caused you.
Why have you laid this curse on me?
Why?
Because you made my poor blind father a cuckold.
Because I wanted to see your seducer's smile die on his face.
Lower your voice.
We'll set off an avalanche.
What do I care?
[Rumbling]
Did you see him, Mother?
White with rage.
If I'd flung a dozen more words in his face, he'd have died on the spot.
Listen to me. Listen.
I'm still your mother.
You're my only child.
If you should die,
I will have no reason to live.
There's still some time to stop this madness.
Come home with me.
[Sigleinde]
Poor Gerda, mountain wild girl.
To be chained so for our safety.
[No Audible Dialogue]
[Bell Clangs]
[Trotta's Voice]
This is most imprudent.
Klara, what is the meaning of this?
I can't think about this right now.
What have you done with your sister?
Well, what do you think, Sigleinde?
Klara, what is the meaning of this?
Come, Sigleinde.
Sigleinde.
Sigleinde.
Sigleinde.
[Rumbling]
Where's Sigleinde?
You'd best give it to Sigleinde.
[Rumbling]
Sigleinde. Sigleinde.
Johann.
Poppa.
Grigorss.
Grigorss.
[Bird Chirping]
[Chains Clink]
Lower the sheepskins.
We'll have music.
Remember... when Johann and you and I... danced together the last time?
How happy we were then.
Yes, we were children of light.
Or so it seemed.
Now the night's come to drown us.
Dance with me.
Hold me.
If I cannot believe in you, all the women of the world are painted like the harlot.
Shh!
It's all a bad dream.
You can beg the Count's forgiveness in front of his servants.
He will spare your life out of love for me.
Perhaps I can go away to a distant land.
Wherever you go, I'll find you.
Mother always knows where her son is hiding.
Does it mean so much to you that I live?
Is it not the Count whose life you fear for?
Precious child.
Look into my eyes.
What do you see?
Gentleness.
Pity.
What can I do to win your faith back?
I'll do anything.
There is one thing you can do.
If you agree,
I will kiss the Count's feet, plead for mercy... and give my blessings to your marriage.
Name it. I'll do it.
Accept Franz as your son.
Go to him. Embrace him.
Franz loves you.
When I leave, there will be no one left to take care of him.
You are right.
There must be peace in this home again.
I have done a great wrong.
It is God's will.
I believe you, Mother.
Forgive me.
Franz. Wake up.
You have a visitor.
My son.
My eldest child.
Is there still room in your heart for me?
Oh.
[Sobbing]
Now I've told you everything.
Franz can begin living.
A great weight has been lifted from me.
I feel revived.
You wear false comforts,
Grigorss.
What about your father?
Have you forgotten him?
Of course not.
Think of what the Count has done to him.
His honor must be vindicated.
But I made a promise to my mother.
You had no right to.
I could not love a man... who placed anything above his father's honor.
Not even his love for me.
Do you think you could love me?
I had no hope of you ever loving me.
I... could love someone who has done his duty.
I've been blind.
Thank God I did not go down on my knees to that monster.
I shall go to the castle at once and arrange the duel.
Knives at dawn.
Here is the hair I have lost in the past three months.
Take it. It belongs to you.
You will know why one day.
If you come out of it alive,
I will be here waiting for you.
And if you don't, you will be waiting, somewhere, for me.
Farewell.
[Chains Clink]
Have you no seconds?
No one in the community would stand against the Count.
Then use Herr Schrammel here.
He'll be sacked otherwise for dropping a teacup.

Grigorss. My poor boy.
What happened?
Did you get caught in a mountain storm?
Mother.
[Liquid Burbling]
Are you conscious?
Do you recognize me?
Where am I?
Safe at home.
I'm rubbing your chest with the goose grease, just as I did when you were a little boy.
Do you remember how often
I promised you that when I grew up...
I would sail out in a big ship and bring you back all the treasures in the world?
Do I remember?
You were to bring me hyacinths because I loved them so much.
And a palm.
Mother, I've done a terrible thing.
No. Last night is past and forgotten.
The Count will forgive you.
You'll see.
I have an influence over him still.
I killed Count Knotkers...
early this morning in a duel.
What?
What are you saying?
You're delirious.
There seemed no other way.
Your name was forming on his lips when he died.
Two more seconds,
and he would have spoken it.
Here. Put this on.
Quickly.
What am I to do?
Get out from this house and never come back.
You have killed my love for you.
Go. Do you hear me?
There is no goodness left in the world.
Franz, I want you to watch over me.
Look at your mother.
I'm rather clumsy.
Only you could help me.
Am I doing this right?
Yes, I think so.
There.
[Wood Clatters]
Klara.
Klara.
Grigorss, you've come at last.
Well?
He is dead.
I am an outcast.
All is not lost.
Come with me.
I have something to show you.
Oh, Klara, you're a wild one.
So are the reindeer when summer is coming.
You must take the gondola across.
There's very little oxygen.
You may find yourself
gasping for breath.
You are not softhearted, are you, Grigorss?
[Laughs]
[Yawns]
No.
I assure you that I'm not.
I have a dreadful secret to share with you.
[Yawns]
About my father.
I'm afraid that in my present state
nothing could seem dreadful.
Could you marry me, Grigorss, even if I were not... chaste?
Chaste?
My God, did Johann dishonor you... before his accident?
No. His thoughts were pure.
He used to call me his golden fleece.
Who then?
My father.
[Yawns]
He ravished me in the woods.
[Yawns]
I refuse to believe it.
Look at this, Grigorss.
My mountain hideaway.
The two of us can be outcasts here together.
We need never see anyone but each other.
We can live on berries and grasses... and small animals we can kill with sharp sticks.
You can sleep in my arms when the mountains blacken.
What about your father?
That won'thy, blameless man.
Are you saying he... he took advantage of you?
Shall I show you the leaves drenched in my blood?
That was not the wedding night
I had imagined.
You must never speak of this.
God has left this mountain to the devil.
We have all joined his unoly dance.
This place can be ours,
Grigorss.
Here we can have our own laws.
Here's my treasure chest.
Shells from the seashore.
A wooden flute.
Quilts that my mother made.
One dire thought occurs to me, but it would freeze my blood to utter it.
Speak.
You could kill my father.
Oh, Klara.
Or better yet,
I could throw myself off a precipice.
Then perhaps Father would repent of his crime and life could go on as usual.
Why should the victim suffer?
We shall have no more talk of suicide.
Do you think your father is capable of repentance?
The hardness of his gaze makes me doubt it.
He asked me to come to his room tonight.
He told me... there would be no more pain.
Monstrous!
He must be killed.
A few hours ago,
I rid this mountain of another villain.
I can still smell his blood on my hands.
Soon I can wash these filthy hands in the blood of your father.
There needrt be any blood.
Suppose we rode with him in a sleigh through Uhlars Pass.
We could tell him it was an errand of mercy.
He will not refuse, because he's a Christian.
You will be driver.
When we get close to the place
where the mountain is nearest
the edge, you can stand...
and fire your pistol.
[Rumbling]
That will start an avalanche.
Father will be startled.
We will both leap to safety.
Father and the sleigh will fall thousands of feet, and his evil will be blotted out.
Let God decide what a just punishment shall be.
Such terrible calm.
I feel like a trembling schoolboy next to you.
Shall we do it?
I hear the angel's trumpet.
It is ordained.
[Footsteps Approaching]
[Footsteps Fade]
I love you.

The eldest brother's
journey now begins.
Lfhe could call out Grigorss's name,

Then she could dry her eyes,
and she and Franz could
continue their search,
together.

- Hello?
- Hello.
- Yes?
- Who is this?
- Who're you trying to reach?
- What number is this?
- Well, what number are you trying to reach?
- I don't know.
- Well, I think you have the wrong number.
- Do I?
It happens. Take it easy.
- Hello.
- I'm sorry. I guess I dialled the wrong number.
- So why'd you dial it again?
- To apologize.
- You're forgiven. Bye now.
- Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
- What?
- I wanna talk to you for a second.
They've got 900 numbers for that.
See ya.
- Hello.
- Why don't you want to talk to me?
- Who is this?
- You tell me your name,
I'll tell you mine.
- I don't think so.
- What's that noise?
- Popcorn.
- You're making popcorn?
- Uh-huh.
- I only eat popcorn at the movies.
- Well, I'm getting ready to watch a video.
- Really? What?
- Oh, just some scary movie.
- Do you like scary movies?
- Uh-huh.
- What's your favourite scary movie?
- Uh, I don't know.
- You have to have a favourite.
What comes to mind?
Um, "Halloween. "
You know, the one with the guy in the white mask who walks around and stalks baby-sitters.
- Yeah.
- What's yours?
- Guess.
- Um, "Nightmare on Elm Street".
- Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
- Yeah, Freddy Krueger.
Freddy, that's right.
I liked that movie. It was scary.
Yeah, the first one was, but the rest sucked.
So, you got a boyfriend?
Why? You wanna ask me out on a date?
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
- No.
- You never told me your name.
- Why do you want to know my name?
- 'Cause I want to know who I'm looking at.
What did you say?
I want to know who I'm talking to.
- That's not what you said.
- What do you think I said?
What?
Hello?
- Look, I gotta go.
- Wait. I thought we were gonna go out.
Uh, nah, I don't think so.
Don't hang up on me!
Shit. Yes?
I told you not to hang up on me.
- What do you want?
- To talk.
Well, dial someone else, okay?
- Listen, asshole-
- No, you listen, you little bitch.
You hang up on me again,
I'll cut you like a fish, understand?
- Yeah.
- Is this some kind of joke?
More of a game, really.
Can you handle that, blondie?
Can you see me?
Listen. I am two seconds away from calling the police.
They'd never make it in time.
We're out in the middle of nowhere.
- What do you want?
- To see what your insides look like.
Who's there?
Who's there?
I'm calling the police.
You should never say "Who's there?"
Don't you watch scary movies?
It's a death wish.
You might as well just come out here to investigate a strange noise or something.
Look, you've had your fun now, so
I think you better just leave or else.
Or else what?
Or else my boyfriend'll be here any second and he'll be pissed when he finds out.
- I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
- I lied! I do have a boyfriend... and he'll be here any second, so your ass better be gone.
- Sure.
- I swear.
He's big and he plays football, and he'll kick the shit out of you!
I'm getting scared.
I'm shaking in my boots.
So you better just leave.
His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?
How do you know his name?
Turn on the patio lights... again.
Oh, God!
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Where are you? Where are you?
- Guess.
- Please don't hurt him.
- That all depends on you.
- Why are you doing this?
- I wanna play a game.
- No.
- Then he dies right now.
- No! No! No!
Which is it?
Which is it?
Well, what kind of a game?
Turn off the light.
You'll see what kind of game.
Just do it!
No, Casey! No! No!
No, Casey!
Here's how we play.
I ask a question.
If you get it right, Steve lives.
- Please don't do this.
- Come on, it'll be fun.
- Please-
- It's an easy category.
- Please.
- Movie trivia.
I'll even give you a warm-up question.
- Don't do this. I can't.
- Name the killer in "Halloween. "
- No.
Come on! It's your favourite scary movie, remember?
- He had a white mask.
He stalked the baby-sitters.
- I don't know.
- Come on. Yes, you do.
- No, please.
- What's his name?
- I- I can't think.
Steve's counting on you.
Michael-
Michael Meyers.
Yes! Very good.
Now for the real question.
- No!
- But you're doing so well.
- We can't stop now.
- Please stop! Leave us alone!
Then answer the question.
Same category.
Oh, please stop.
Name the killer in
"Friday the 13th. "
Jason! Jason, Jason!
I'm sorry.
That's the wrong answer.
No, it's not!
No, it's not. It was Jason.
Afraid not. No way.
Listen, it was Jason!
I saw that movie 20 goddam times!
Then you should know Jason's mother,
Mrs Voorhees, was the original killer.
Jason didn't show up until the sequel.
I'm afraid that was a wrong answer.
- You tricked me.
- Lucky for you there's a bonus round.
But poor Steve.
I'm afraid he's out!
Hey, we're not finished yet.
Final question.
Are you ready?
Please, please, leave me alone.
Answer the question, and I will.
What door am I at?
- What?
- There are two main doors to your house.
The front door and the patio doors.
If you answer correctly, you live. Very simple.
Don't do this.
I can't. I won't.
Your call.
Did you water over here today?
- It was just that water from the rain.
- They look great, don't they?
- Don't they smell strong?
- I told you you could send it back.
Mom!
- Jesus!
- What is it?
Casey!
Oh, G-
Casey. Casey. Casey!
- Where is she?
- Call the police!
- Casey! Casey, are you upstairs?
- Oh, my God. Casey, baby?
- Where is she?
- She's- She's here.
- Mom.
- Oh, my God, I, I can hear her.
- Mom.
- Where is she?
Oh, my God!
I can hear her.
Hey!
Get in the car.
Drive down to the MacKenzies'.
- No. No, not my daughter.
- Just go.
- Not my daughter.
- Call the police.
- It's just me.
- Billy, what the-
What are you doing here?
- Sorry, don't hate me.
- Oh, my God!
- What, do you sleep in that?
Yes, I sleep in this. You gotta go.
My dad is in the other room.
You can't be in here.
- Okay, I'll just stay a sec.
- No- You can't be in here.
Oh, no. You gotta go. Go, go, go.
- What's going on in there? Are you okay?
- Can you knock?
- I heard screaming.
- No, you didn't.
- No?
Oh, well.
I'm hittin' the sack.
My flight leaves first thing in the morning.
Now, the expo runs all weekend, so I won't be back till Sunday.
- There's cash on the table, and I'm staying at-
- The Hilton.
- Out at the airport, so call if-
- If I need anything. Yeah, I got it.
I could've sworn
I heard screaming.
- Have a good trip, okay?
- Sleep tight, sweetie.
- Oh, close call.
- Billy, what're you doing here?
- Well, it occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.
- Shh, shh, shh.
Great idea. Now that it's out of your system.
You know, I was home watching television. The, uh-
"The Exorcist" was on.
It got me thinking of you.
- It did?
- Yeah, it was edited for TV.
You know, all the good stuff was cut out. And it got me thinking of us... how two years ago we started off hot and heavy.
Nice solid R-rating on our way to an NC-17.
And now things have changed and... lately we're just sort of edited for television.
Oh, so you thought you would climb in my window and we'd have a little raw footage?
No. No, I wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule.
I just thought maybe we could do a little on-top-of-the-clothes stuff.
- Okay.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- If we ever fly away
Baby, I'm with you
Baby, I'm your man
Hey.
Okay. Okay, okay.
Time is up, stud-bucket.
God, you see what you do to me?
You know what my dad'll do to you?
Yeah. I'm going.
Okay.
Romeo and Juliet
Are together in eternity
You know, I- I appreciate the romantic gesture.
So, come on, baby
Hey, about the, uh- the sex stuff...
I- I'm not trying to rush you at all.
- I was only half serious.
- Okay.
Baby, I'm your man
Baby, I'm your man
Hey, Billy.
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?
What's that?
My God.
You're just a tease.
Thirty-five-
Situation under control.
Roger, dispatch.
There's blood found?
All right.
They are doing drugs that they buy in the classrooms... and that they are involved in the occult.
Occult?
Woodsboro, California, was devastated last night when two young teenagers were found brutally murdered.
Authorities have yet to issue a statement, but our sources tell us... that no arrest has been made and the murderer could strike again.
- Do you believe this shit?
- Damn! What is going on?
- You don't know?
- No.
- Casey Becker and Steve Orth were killed last night.
- What? No way.
And we're not just talking killed.
We're talking splatter-movie killed.
Ripped open from end to end.
- Casey Becker, she sits next to me in English.
- Not any more. It's so sad.
Her mom and dad, they found her hanging from a tree, her insides on the outside.
Oh, my God!
Do they know who did it?
Fucking clueless. I mean, they're interrogating the entire school.
- Teachers, students, janitors.
- They think it's school-related?
They don't know. I mean,
Dewey was saying this is the worst crime they've seen in years.
Even worse than-
Well, it's bad.
- Here you go, Mrs Tate.
- Thank you, James.
Sidney. It would appear to be your turn.
- Who's up next?
- Uh, Sidney Prescott.
- Prescott.
She was daughter of, uh-
- Sidney, how you feelin'?
- Fine.
- Hi, Sidney.
- Sheriff Burke, Dewey.
Uh, that's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
- How is everything?
- Good.
And your dad?
How's he doin'?
- We're fine. Thanks.
- We're gonna keep this very brief, Sidney.
- The police just want to ask you a few questions. You okay?
- Mm-hmm.
Sidney, were you very close to Casey Becker?
Remember, your principal loves you, and I want you to be safe.
All students are encouraged to return to their homes promptly from school grounds. Avoid strangers.
- Walk in twos and threes.
Counsellors will be here tomorrow.
- What kind of questions did they ask you, Sidney?
- Thank you.
- They asked if I knew Casey.
- Yeah, they asked me that too.
- Hey, did they ask if you like to hunt?
- Yeah, they did.
- Did they ask you?
- Hunt? Why would they ask you if you like to hunt?
'Cause their bodies were gutted.
- Thank you, Randy.
- They didn't ask me if I like to hunt.
- It's 'cause there's no way a girl could've killed 'em.
- That is so sexist.
The killer could easily be female.
"Basic Instinct. "
That was an ice pick.
Not exactly the same thing.
Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out.
And the fact is, it takes a man to do something like that.
- Or a man's mentality.
- How do you gut someone?
You take a knife, and you slit 'em from the groin to sternum.
Hey, it's called tact, you fuck rag.
Hey, Stu, didn't you used to date Casey?
- Yeah, for like two seconds.
- Before she dumped you for Steve.
- I thought you dumped her for me.
- I did. He's full of shit.
And are the police aware that you dated the victim?
Hey, what're you saying?
That- That- That I killed her?
- It would certainly improve your high school "Q."
- Stu was with me last night, okay?
- Yeah, I was.
- Was that before or after he sliced and diced?
- Fuck you, nut case.
Where were you last night?
- Working, thank you.
- Oh, at the video store?
I thought they fired your sorry ass.
- Twice.
- I didn't kill anybody.
- Nobody said you did.
Thanks, buddy. Besides, it takes a man to do something like that.
- I'm gonna gut your ass in a second, kid.
- Tell me something. Did you really put her liver in the mailbox?
'Cause I heard that they found her liver in the mailbox next to her spleen and her pancreas.
Randy, you goon! Fuck!
I'm trying to eat here. Okay?
She's getting mad, all right?
You better "liver" alone.
"Liver" alone!
"Liv-" Ow! "Liver. Liver. Liv-"
It was a joke.
See you, Sidney.
I'll talk to you tomorrow, Sid.
So, you sure I can stay over, 'cause my dad won't be back till Sunday.
No problem.
I'll pick you up after practise.
You okay?
Uh-huh. It's just, you know, the police and reporters... and everything, it's like deja vu all over again.
I'll be there by 7:00,
I promise.
- Thanks, Tatum.
- Later.
The bodies of 17-year-old Casey Becker and her 18-year-old boyfriend
Steven Orth... were discovered late last night by the girl's parents-
The Woodsboro double murder case.
Authorities are baffled by the lack of clues and the savage-
The town's in shock, and no one can quite believe what has happened here... although this is not the first time this small community... of Woodsboro has endured such tragedy.
Only a year ago Maureen Prescott, wife and mother... was found raped and murdered not far from this peaceful town square.
- Hello?
- Practise ran late.
I'm on my way, okay?
- It's past 7:00.
- Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it till way after 10:00.
Oh. Oh, that's comforting.
I'm gonna swing by the video store.
I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in
"All The Right Moves. "
You know, if you pause it just right, you can see his penis.
- Whatever. Just hurry, okay?
- Ta-ta, Sid.
- Tatum, just get in the car-
- Hello, Sidney.
Uh, hi, who is this?
You tell me.
- Well, I-I have no idea.
- Scary night, isn't it?
With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
Randy, you gave yourself away.
Are you calling from work,
'cause Tatum's on her way over.
Do you like scary movies,
Sidney?
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
What's your favourite scary movie?
- Oh, come on.
You know I don't watch that shit.
- Why not? Too scared?
No, no. It's just, what's the point?
They're all the same.
Some stupid killer stalking some big-breasted girl who can't act... who's always running up the stairs when she should be going out the front door.
- It's insulting.
- Are you alone in the house?
Randy, that's so unoriginal.
I'm disappointed in you.
Maybe that's because
I'm not Randy.
- So, who are you?
- The question isn't "Who am I?"
The question is
"Where am I?"
S- S-So, where are you?
Your front porch.
Why would you be calling from my front porch?
That's the original part.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I call your bluff.
- So, where are you?
- Right here.
- Can you see me right now?
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh. Okay.
What am I doin'? Huh?
Huh? What am I doin'?
Hello!
Nice try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry up, okay? Bye now.
If you hang up on me, you'll die just like your mother!
Do you wanna die, Sidney?
Your mother sure didn't.
Fuck you, you cretin!
No!
Shit!
- Billy!
- The door's locked.
I heard screaming. You all right?
The killer's here. He's in the house.
No, he's in the house.
He's got a knife.
He's gonna kill us.
He's gone. He's gone.
It's all right.
What?
Sid, what?
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
Wait, Sidney, wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
What's going on?
Sidney, come back!
Sidney!
Sorry! I found this.
Come on!
- All right, hold your hands together.
- Do you wish to give up your right to remain silent?
- I didn't do anything.
- Do you wish to give up your right to speak to an attorney... and have them present during questioning?
Ask her. She'll tell you.
Ask her.
- What do you got, Dewey?
- I caught him, Sheriff.
- Wait, who is that?
- Billy Loomis.
- Sheriff, Sheriff, call these guys off.
- I didn't do it.
- Let's go.
Sheriff, wait!
Wait, listen. Call my dad.
Please, call him.
He'll tell you. Just call him.
Sidney! Sidney!
- How's she doing?
- Sid's tougher than she looks.
- She'd have to be, all the shit she's been through.
- Sid!
Well, we're seein' a lot of you today.
You gonna be able to come down to the station and answer a few questions, Sid?
Oh, shit, Sidney! God, Sid, I'm so sorry
I was late. Are you all right?
- Tatum, you can't be here.
This is an official crime scene.
- It's okay.
Her dad's out of town, all right?
She's staying with us tonight.
- Does Mom know?
- Yes, doofus.
- Let's get you out of here.
- She'll be okay.
- Thanks.
- Come on, Sid.
- Oh, you won't believe this.
Creepy, huh?
- I'll be damned.
- What?
- Jesus! The camera, hurry!
My name isn't Jesus.
Sidney, is that you in there? Excuse me.
Is that Sidney Prescott they took away?
- I'm not talking to you.
- What happened to her?
- None of your damn business.
- I heard something about a costume. Is that true?
- Can you tell me anything?
- Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass.
Leave Sid alone.
Where's she goin'?
- Look. Kenny?
- Yeah?
I know that you're about 50 pounds overweight, but when I say "hurry"... please interpret that as
"move your fat, tub-of-lard ass now!"
- Did you find him?
- Are you sure it was the Hilton?
- At the airport.
- He's not registered there.
Could he have stayed somewhere else?
I don't know. I guess.
- Don't worry, Sid. We'll find him.
- Dewey, they got that mask in.
- Roger, dispatch.
- I'll be right back.
Hold on a minute.
Let me ask you this. What're you doin' with a cellular telephone, son?
Everybody's got one, Sheriff.
- I didn't make those calls, I swear.
- Why don't you check the phone bill, for Christ's sake!
- Call Vital Phone Comp. They got the records of every number dialled.
- Thanks, Hank. We're on top of it.
- What were you doing over at Sidney's house tonight?
- I wanted to see her, that's all.
And last night? Sidney said you crawled through her window last night too.
You went out last night?
I was watchin' TV. I got bored.
I decided to go for a ride.
Did you happen to ride by
Casey Becker's house?
No. No, I didn't.
Sheriff, I didn't kill anybody!
We're gonna have to hold you, son, till we get those phone records.
This is crazy.
You know that?
I didn't do it.
- Camera Two?
- Go. I do.
- Okay.
Are there any more doughnuts in there?
- Move it, Kenny.
- They're not lettin' anybody in.
- I'm not just anyone.
- Bitch goddess.
- Kenny, are we on?
- Yeah, go.
- Hi, Gale Weathers reporting live from Woodsboro police station...
- Hey, where's she going?
- where we hope to get a glimpse of Sidney Prescott.
- Hey, watch it, lady.
- Hey, watch the hand! Do you know who you're dealing with?
- No cameras, please.
Tell 'em.
Come on, Dad. Tell 'em!
- He's waiting for the lawyer, Billy.
- Sidney!
- Sidney, come on. You know me.
- All right, come on.
- Sidney, look at me!
- Don't give us any trouble.
Come on!
Sid, we're gonna get you out of here, okay? Are you okay?
They sell this costume at every five-and-dime in the state.
There's no way to track the purchase.
- What about that cellular phone bill?
- Well, we're pulling Loomis's account.
We won't know anything until the morning.
Oh, come on!
- You think he did it?
- Twenty years ago,
I would've said, "Not a chance. "
But these kids today, damned if I know.
- Hey, Dewey, can we go now?
- Hold on a second.
Goddamn it, Dewey!
What did Mama tell you?
When I wear this badge, you treat me like a man of the law!
- I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy, but we're ready to go. Now, okay?
- Whoa.
Uh, take 'em out the back way.
Avoid that circus out there.
- Come on.
- Don't touch me!
- He's my superior.
- The janitor is your superior.
Let's get back to work!
- Isn't there a back way out of this building?
- Yeah. Down that alley, I think.
You guys just stay here. I'm gonna get the car. Don't move. Don't make a sound.
There she is. Sidney!
Hi. That was some night.
What happened? Are you all right?
- She's not answering any questions, all right? Just leave us alone.
- No. No. Tatum. It's okay.
- She's just doin' her job, right, Gale?
- Yes, that's right.
- So, how's the book?
- Well, it'll be out later this year.
Oh, I'll look for it.
I'll send you a copy.
- Jeez. Nice shot.
- Bitch!
- No, I mean, camera shot.
- Where'd you learn to punch like that?
God, I loved it.
"I'll send you a copy. "
Bam! Bitch went down.
"I'll send you a copy. " Bam!
Sid- Superbitch! You are so cool.
Thought you might want some ice for that right hook.
Thanks.
I'll be right next door.
Try to get some sleep.
Yeah, yeah.
Do you really think
Billy did it?
He was there, Tatum.
He was destined to have a flaw.
I knew he was too perfect.
- Telephone, honey.
- Who is it?
- It's for Sid.
- My dad?
- I don't think so.
- Take a message.
- No, um, I'll get it.
How's she doin'?
- Hello.
- Hello, Sidney.
- No!
- Poor Billy-boyfriend.
- An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.
- Leave me alone!
- Looks like you fingered the wrong guy again.
- Dewey!
- Who are you?
- Dewey!
- Hang up, Sid.
- Don't worry.
- You'll find out soon enough. I promise.
- Dewey!
What?
- What?
- What?
Hello.
Sidney Prescott, who escaped a vicious attack last night... is the daughter of Maureen Prescott who was brutally killed last year... when convicted murderer Cotton Weary broke into their home... and savagely raped and tortured the deceased.
Cotton Weary is currently awaiting appeal for the death sentence... handed down after the young Sidney testified against him.
She was the key witness in the State's case against the-
It's never gonna stop, is it?
Billy was released.
His cellular bill was clean.
He didn't make those calls.
We're checkin' every cellular account in the county.
Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced.
It's gonna take some time, but we'll find him.
You okay?
Don't worry, Sid, it's school.
You'll be safe here.
- So how does it feel to be almost brutally butchered?
- Hey! Hey, now leave her alone.
- Come on, Sid.
- People wanna know.
They have a right to know.
- Leave her alone.
- How does it feel?
- She just wants to get an education.
Turn that thing off.
What?
Just a sec.
- Stop right there.
- I'm not here to fight.
I just need to talk.
- Kenny, camera, now!
- Off the record. No camera.
- Forget it.
- Please? You owe me.
- I owe you shit!
- You owe my mother!
Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
- Right. And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
- What is your problem?
You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary's in jail. They're gonna gas him.
A book is not gonna change that.
- Do you still think he's innocent?
- Your testimony put him away.
It doesn't really matter what I think.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
I think you falsely identified him, yes.
- Have you talked to Cotton?
- Many times.
- And has his story changed?
- Not one word.
He admits to having sex with your mother, but that's all.
He's lying.
She never would've touched him.
He raped her, and then he- he butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
He was drunk that night.
He left his coat at your house after your mother seduced him.
- I saw him leave wearing it.
- No, you saw someone leave wearing that coat.
The same someone who planted it in Cotton's car, framing him.
No. Cotton murdered my mother.
You're not so sure any more, are you?
Nice welt, sweetie.
Let's go, Sid.
- The killer's still on the loose, isn't he?
- Come on, Sid.
- Those murders are related.
- I'm sorry I mangled your face.
- Wait, Sidney, don't go!
- Just stop, all right?
Jesus Christ!
An innocent man on death row.
- A killer still on the loose.
Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
- You wanna go live?
No, no, no. Not so fast.
We don't have anything concrete.
- This is huge. You can't just sit on it.
- I know! That's why we need proof.
If I'm right about this,
I could save a man's life.
Do you know what that could do for my book sales?
This is a mistake.
I shouldn't be here.
I want you to meet me right here after class, okay, Sid?
All right.
Hey, I haven't seen Billy around.
Is he really pissed?
Oh, you mean after you branded him the Candyman?
- No, his heart's broken. Ow!
- Stu!
Why are they doing this?
Are you kidding me?
Look at this place. It's like Christmas.
- Stupidity leak.
- Ow. Easy.
Sidney!
- Ow!
- Jesus! Shit!
It's just me.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You still think it's me.
No. No, I-I don't.
- It's just somebody was there.
- Hey, Christy, wait up!
- Billy, someone- someone tried to kill me.
- I know. I know. I know.
The cops said I scared him away.
It wasn't me, Sid.
I know. He called me again last night at Tatum's house.
You see? It couldn't have been me.
I was in jail. Remember?
I'm so sorry.
Please understand.
Understand what? That I have a girlfriend who would rather accuse me... of being a psychopathic killer than touch me?
- You know that's not true.
- Then what is it?
What is it? Billy, I was attacked and nearly filleted last night!
I mean between us.
You haven't been the same since-
- Since your mother died.
- Is your brain leaking?
My mom was killed. I can't believe you're bringing this up!
- It's been a year.
- Tomorrow! One year tomorrow.
I know. I think it's time you got over that. I mean, when my mom left my dad, I accepted it.
It's the way it is.
She's not comin' back.
Your parents split up.
This is not the same thing.
Your mom left town.
She's not lying in a coffin somewhere.
Okay, okay, okay, I'm sorry.
It's- It's a bad analogy.
But it's just that...
I want my girlfriend back.
- Sid!
- Billy, I am sorry if my traumatized life... is an inconvenience to you and your perfect existence.
What? What are you-
Nobody said that. Sid!
- Stupid.
- You make me so sick!
Your entire havoc-inducing, thieving, whoring generation disgusts me!
So, two of your fellow students just savagely murdered... and this is the way that you show your compassion and sensitivity, huh?
Let me tell you something.
You're both expelled! Get out!
Oh, come on, Mr Himbry!
It was just a joke.
Yeah, that's not fair!
You're absolutely right.
It is not fair.
Fairness would be to rip your insides out, hang you from a tree... so we can expose you for the heartless, desensitized little shits that you are.
- She was never attacked.
I think she made it all up.
- Why would she lie about it?
For attention!
The girl has some serious issues.
What if she did it? What if
Sidney killed Casey and Steve?
And why would she do that?
Maybe she had the hots for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage.
What would Sidney want with Steve?
She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend, Billy.
Maybe she's a slut just like her mother.
- You're evil.
- Please, it's a common fact.
- Her mother was a tramp.
- Cut some slack.
She watched her mom get butchered.
Yeah, and it fucked her up royally.
Think about it.
Her mother's death leaves her disturbed and hostile.
In a cruel and inhumane world, she's delusional.
Where is God? Etcetera.
Completely suicidal.
One day she snaps.
She wants to kill herself... but she realizes that teen suicide is out this year... and homicide is a much healthier, therapeutic expression.
- Where do you get this shit?
- "Ricki Lake. "
You are pathetic.
Pathetic.
Sidney.
Sidney.
Is someone there?
In what appears to be a prank, several students were seen wearing scary masks.
School officials have yet to comment... but this is known to be the same costume worn by the killer.
Seventeen-year-old Casey Becker and her boyfriend Steven Orth have already lost their lives.
Who's next? You can literally feel the fear on this campus.
Hi. Gale Weathers, field correspondent, "Top Story. "
I know who you are, Miss Weathers.
How's the eye?
It's productive.
Is there a problem on campus?
No, everything's under control.
- Well, of course. You're here.
- You're not supposed to be here.
I know. I should be in New York covering the Sharon Stone stalker, but who knew?
- You look awfully young to be a police officer.
- I'm 25 years old.
You know, in a demographic study
I proved to be most popular amongst males 11 to 24.
Guess I just missed you.
Of course, you don't look a day over 12.
Except in that upper torso area.
Does the force require you to work out?
No, ma'am.
Because of my boyish good looks... muscle mass has increased my acceptance as a serious police officer.
I need your attention now, kids. Due to the recent events that have occurred... effective immediately, all classes are suspended until further notice.
The Woodsboro police department has issued a citywide curfew... beginning at 9:00 tonight.
Looks like we've got a serial killer on our hands.
Well, serial killer's not really accurate.
Gotta knock off a couple more to get that title.
Well, we can hope, can't we?
I mean, we certainly don't have any leads.
- Have you located Sidney's father yet?
- No, not yet.
- Well, he's not a suspect, is he?
- We haven't ruled him out as a possibility.
- If you'll excuse me.
- I'm sorry. Am I keeping you?
If I may say so,
Miss Weathers... you are much prettier in person.
So you do watch the show.
I'm 25.
I was 24 for a whole year.
Please, call me Gale!
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh, Sidney.
No, it was him, Tatum.
I know it.
Well, you're not to be alone any more.
If you pee, I pee. Is that clear?
"Kizzo-kaskizzo is is-out. "
I don't know what you did, Sidney, but on behalf of the entire student body, we all say, "Thank you!"
- Drop it, Stu.
- No, I say... an impromptu party tonight, my house.
- Celebrate this little siesta.
What do you say?
- Are you serious?
As long as this little vixen doesn't invite the entire world, we'll be fine.
Intimate gathering, intimate friends.
What do you say, Sid?
I mean, pathos could have its perks?
I will totally protect you. Yo,
I am so buff. I got you covered, girl.
- No.
- Come on, Sid. For me?
It could be fun.
- Okay. Whatever.
- Yeah? Nice.
Cool. You guys bring food, all right?
Yes?
Hello?
- Damn little shits.
- What'd you call me? Huh?
- Not you, Fred.
- You prick.
School's out for summer
- School's out
- What if Cotton Weary is telling the truth?
- With fever
- Maybe he was having an affair with your mom.
- I mean, your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe-
- School's out
- Completely
- Maybe your mom was just a very unhappy woman.
If- If they were having an affair, then how come
Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
Well, you can't prove a rumour.
That's why it's a rumour.
Right. Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
It goes further back, Sid.
There's been talk about other men.
And you believe it.
Well, I mean, you can only hear that Richard Gere gerbil story so many times... before you have to start believing it.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You know, if-if I was wrong about Cotton Weary, then the killer's still out there.
Don't go there, Sid.
You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick or something.
Don't freak yourself out, okay? We've got a long night ahead of us. Okay?
Let's boogie.
- It's alive!
- Henry!
Oh, in the name of God, now I know-
Excuse me, dude.
- Watch it, jerk.
- I'm sorry.
Dork.
Jesus, this place is packed tonight, man.
- We had a run in the mass murder section.
- Comin' to my fiesta?
- Yeah, I'm off early. Curfew, you know.
- Cool.
What's that werewolf movie with E.T.'s mom in it?
- "The Howling. " Horror. Straight ahead.
- Okay, thanks.
- Oh, now that's in poor taste.
- What?
If you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath... would you be standing in the horror section?
What? It was just a misunderstanding.
He didn't do anything.
You're such a little lapdog. He's got
"killer" printed all over his forehead.
Okay! Really? Well, why'd the cops let him go, smart guy?
Because obviously they don't watch enough movies.
This is standard horror movie stuff.
- "Prom Night" revisited, man.
- Yeah? Why would he wanna kill his own girlfriend?
There's always some stupid, bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend.
- Oh?
- That's the beauty of it all: simplicity.
Besides, if it gets too complicated, you lose your target audience.
Well, what's his reason?
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
- What, is she savin' herself for you?
- Maybe.
Now that Billy tried to mutilate her, do you think Sid would go out with me?
No, I don't at all. No.
You know who I think it is?
You know, I think it's her father.
Why can't they find her pops, man?
Because he's probably dead.
His body will come poppin' up in the last reel somewhere!
Eyes gouged out, fingers cut off, teeth knocked out!
- See, the police are always off track with this shit.
- Man!
If they'd watch "Prom Night," they'd save time.
There's a formula to it. A very simple formula! Everybody's a suspect!
I'm telling you, the dad's a red herring. It's Billy.
How do we know you're not the killer? Huh? Huh?
- Hi, Billy.
- Maybe your movie-freaked mind lost its reality button. You ever think of that?
You're absolutely right.
I'm the first to admit it.
- If this were a scary movie,
I'd be the prime suspect.
- That's right.
And what would be your motive?
It's the millennium.
Motives are incidental.
"Millennium. "
"Millennium. " I like that.
That's good. It's the millennium.
Good kid.
"Millennium. "
Good word, my man.
Are you telling me that's not a killer?
You'll see him in your nightmares
You'll see him in your dreams
He'll appear out of nowhere
But he ain't
What he seems
You'll see him in your head
On the TV screen
Hey, buddy
I'm warnin' you to turn it off
Ah, he's a ghost
He's a god
He's a man
He's a guru
You're one microscopic cog in his catastrophic plan
Designed and directed by his red right hand
Sure is quiet.
God, look at this place.
It's "The Town That Dreaded Sundown. "
Yeah, I saw that movie.
It's about a killer in Texas, huh?
Hey, Sid, just think. If they make a movie about you, who's gonna play you?
- I shudder to think.
- I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.
Thanks, Dewey. With my luck, they'd cast Tori Spelling.
I'm just gonna be a few minutes.
You girls don't go too far.
- Is Billy gonna be there tonight?
- He better not be.
I told Stu to keep his mouth shut.
I think we can live without the endorphin rush for one night.
Billy's right, you know. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.
So you have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death.
It's no big deal, Sid.
I mean, you'll thaw out.
Yeah, but he has been so patient with me, you know, with all the sex stuff.
How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
Billy and his penis don't deserve you, all right?
- Dewey, where the hell you been?
- I was keepin' an eye on Sidney, uh-
- Thought you quit.
- I did. But damn it-
Dewey, Vital Phone just faxed us.
Those calls are listed to Neil Prescott, Sidney's father.
He made the calls with a cellular phone.
It's been confirmed.
There's no way a cellular could've been cloned?
There's more.
Guess what tomorrow is.
The anniversary of his wife's death.
We'll keep the roadblocks and the curfew in effect through the night.
If he's not picked up by morning, then we'll do a house-to-house.
- Where's Sidney?
- She's with my sister.
You want me to bring her in?
No. Not just yet.
Let's find Neil first, make sure he's our man.
You stay close to Sidney.
Don't let her out of your sight.
Yes, sir.
Say a prayer for the youth of America
God bless the youth of America
And I can't stand their sight any more
All right, you girls have fun.
Not too much fun, or I'll bust ya.
- Bye.
- Bye, Sid.
You're obsessed
You're obsessed
Here, kids!
- Oh, that's mature.
- You guys were tardy for the party, so we started without you.
My man!
- Well, were we spotted?
- I don't think so. Go get the camera.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare ya.
- Deputy, that's okay.
- What brings you to these parts?
Well, you just never know when or where a story will break.
Not much of a story here.
Just a bunch of kids cuttin' it loose.
Then what are you doing here?
Just keepin' an eye on things.
I'm gonna check the party out.
- Do you mind if I join you?
- Not at all.
All right.
Let me just get my coat. Thanks.
- All right.
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Oh! Yeah.
- How many "Evil Deads?"
- One!
- Two!
- How many "Hellraisers?"
- Hellraiser right here.
"The Fog," "Terror Train,"
"Prom Night. "
How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all of these movies?
She's the scream queen.
- With a set of lungs like that, she should be.
- Yeah.
- Tits. See?
- Oh, I'll get it.
- Hey, Tate, grab me another beer, would ya?
- There's more beer in the garage.
- What am I, the beer wench?
- She was nominated-
- She was nominated for "Terror Train. "
- You're not gonna believe who's here!
- It's that chick from "Top Story!"
- Gale Weathers?
- Here!
- Shit!
- You're under age, son.
I'm kiddin'. Have a good time.
Watch the drivin'.
- Dewey.
- Hi.
Dewey.
- What is she doing here?
- She's with me.
- I'm just checkin' things out.
- So you did.
Now leave, and take your media mouth with you.
- I just think you're awesome.
- Oh, thank you very much.
- I watch your show religiously.
- That's great.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I need a camera.
- Have you found my father?
- I'm afraid not.
- Should I be worried?
- Not yet.
- Get out, you're walkin'
- That's the one I want.
Too bad, I've spoken
When I look at you you're forgiven
You're forgiven
Jesus!
Tatum, it's okay.
Shit.
Hey, shitheads!
Hello!
Shit. Piss.
Is that you, Randy?
Cute. What movie is this from?
"I Spit On Your Garage?"
Lose the outfit.
If Sidney sees it, she'll flip.
Oh, you wanna play psycho killer?
Can I be the helpless victim?
Okay, let's see- No, please don't kill me, Mr Ghost Face.
I wanna be in the sequel!
Cut, Casper.
That's a wrap.
Randy, what the hell are you doing?
Stop!
Fucker!
- Happy curfew.
- Nice party, Stu.
- Tatum, come on!
- There's nobody here but us chickens!
- Do you know where she is?
- No, I haven't seen her.
Oh. Billy. Hey.
Billy. Hmm.
What are you doin' here?
I was hoping I could talk to Sid alone.
You know, if Tatum sees you here, she'll draw blood.
I tell you what. Why don't you guys go up to my parents' room?
You know, you guys can talk, whatever.
Subtlety, Stu.
You should look it up.
No, i-it's okay.
We do need to talk.
- What's Leatherface doin' here?
- Cute. He came to make up.
There goes my chance with Sid.
Damn it.
As if.
That's all I'm sayin'.
As if.
Oh, really, Alicia?
"As if. "
I'm gonna go check on them.
- Come on!
- Okay, everyone.
It was nice to meet all of you.
- Thank you.
- Stick around.
You're a genius.
- Oh, shit.
- What?
- I got a delay.
- How long is it?
I don't know. What'd it take you to walk from the house, 30 seconds?
- It'll be fine. Just record it.
- All right.
Oh, the placement is perfect.
Tell me, Kenneth-
Has a cheesy tabloid journalist ever won the Pulitzer?
- Well, first time for everything.
- You're damn right.
S- So, um-
So-
Look, I'm sorry.
I've been selfish, and I want to apologize.
No, Billy, I-I'm... the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed... with all this post-traumatic stress.
- You lost your mom.
- Yeah, I know, but you're right.
Enough is enough.
I-
I can't wallow in-in the grief process forever... and- and I can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was.
Yeah, I think I'm really... scared... that I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know?
Like "The Bad Seed" or somethin'.
And I know-
I know it doesn't make sense.
Yeah, it does.
It's like Jodie Foster in
"The Silence of the Lambs"... when she keeps having flashbacks of her dead father.
But this is life.
This isn't a movie.
Sure it is, Sid.
It's all-
It's all a movie.
It's all... one great big movie.
Only you can't pick your genre.
Why can't I be a Meg Ryan movie?
Or even a good porno.
- What?
- You heard me.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
I think so.
Look, look, look.
Here it comes.
Oh, man.
The colour of the blood is all wrong!
Why do they do that?
It's too red!
Wait. Here comes another.
Here it- Here it-
- Ooh!
- Yes! Yes!
Predictable.
I knew he was gonna bite it.
How can you watch this shit over and over?
When do we see breasts?
I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts.
- When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
- Yes. Yes.
- Breasts?
Not until "Trading Places" in '83.
Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies.
She never showed her tits till she went legits.
- Could afford a decent pair.
- What did you-
That's why she always outsmarted the killer in the big chase scene at the end.
Only virgins can do that.
Don't you know the rules?
- What rules?
- You don-
Jesus Christ.
You don't know the rules?
Have an aneurysm, why don't ya?
There are certain rules that one must abide by... in order to successfully survive a horror movie.
For instance, number one:
You can never have sex.
- Big no-no! Big no-no!
- I'd be a dead man.
- Sex equals death. Okay?
- Yes!
Number two:
You can never drink or do drugs.
No, the sin factor.
It's a sin.
It's an extension of number one.
And number three:
Never, ever, ever... under any circumstances say,
"I'll be right back,"
'cause you won't be back.
- I'm gettin' another beer.
You want one?
- Yeah, sure.
I'll be right back!
You see? You push the laws and you end up dead.
Okay? I'll see you in the kitchen with a knife.
Only virgins can outsmart the killer in the big chase scene at the end.
- Don't you know the rules?
- What rules?
You don't know the rules?
There are certain rules...
- that one must abide by in order to essentially survive a horror movie.
- Boring.
- For instance-
- The sheriff just radioed.
Somebody reported a car in the bushes down the road.
I'm gonna go check it out.
- Would you care to join me?
- I'd love to.
If you're sure it's all right.
Ma'am,
I'm the deputy of this town.
Be right back.
You see, you push the laws and you end up dead.
- W- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Mm-hmm?
I thought maybe we'd walk.
It's such a nice night out.
I got a flashlight.
- You're not scared, are ya?
- No.
- All right.
- Great.
Do you know what that constellation is?
No. What is it?
I don't know.
That's why I was askin' you.
- What happened to Tatum, Stu?
- She probably got pissed at me and bailed.
- Bye.
- Bye.
No, I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.
Look! Here comes the obligatory tit shot!
- Yes! Oh! That was beautiful!
- Lovely!
- Oh, my God.
- I'll leave you guys alone.
You are so... amazing.
Hello? Yeah?
Holy shit.
N- Ho-
Listen up.
They found
Principal Himbry dead.
- Hey. Hey.
- To arms! To arms!
- Where did he say he was?
- Where are you guys-
Where are you guys-
- At the football field!
- Come on!
- Where you guys goin'?
We were just gettin' to the good part.
Hello? Yeah?
Where are you guys-
Heigh-ho, Silver!
Let's go!
- So, is- is Dewey your real name?
- No, it's Dwight.
Dwight?
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's all right.
Dewey's just somethin'
I got stuck with a long time ago.
Well, I like it.
It's sexy.
- Sexy?
- Mm-hmm.
Ah, it's just this town's way of not takin' me serious.
What about Gale Weathers?
Sounds like I'm a meteorologist or something.
People treat me like I'm the antichrist of television journalism.
- I don't think you're that bad.
- No?
- No.
I think that's just 'cause you kinda like me.
They sure are comin' fast.
Slow down!
Freeze! Jump!
- I'm sorry. Are you okay?
- Yeah.
I'm sorry.
I'm on duty.
Is that what you're looking for?
My whole life.
- Damn!
- What?
- What is it?
- This is Neil Prescott's car.
- Sidney's father?
- Yeah.
Jesus.
What's he doing here?
We gotta get back.
You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
- Who'd you call?
- What?
Well, I don't know. When you're arrested you're allowed one phone call.
So I was just curious.
Who'd you call?
Called my dad.
No, um, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
Yeah, but when I called
I didn't get an answer.
You don't still think it was me, do you?
No.
No. I was just thinking... if it were you it'd be a very clever way to throw me off track.
You know, using your one phone call to call me so that I wouldn't think it was you, that's all.
Really.
What do I have to do to prove to you that I'm not a killer?
- Oh, my God.
- Huh?
- Oh, my God.
- Sidney-
- Billy, watch out!
Sid.
Shit!
Help me, somebody!
Help me!
Help me!
No, Jamie.
Uh, watch out.
Watch out, Jamie.
You know he's around.
You- You know-
Look-
Look, there he is.
I told you.
I told you he was right around the corner.
Jamie. Jamie.
Jamie, look behind you.
Look behind you.
Turn around.
Behind you.
All the time!
Behind you!
Behind you, Jamie.
Jamie, turn around.
Ohh! God! Yeah.
Help me! Help!
Let me in!
- The killer's coming after me!
He's in the house!
- Where? Wait.
- There's a camera in the house. Look.
- Behind you!
- Oh, my God. No.
- Oh, shit.
- Jamie. Jamie.
- Behind you, kid!
- Randy!
- Behind ya!
- Look around!
- Shit.
- What?
- We're on 30-second delay.
Oh, my God.
- Is there a phone in the van?
- Yeah.
Lock yourself in it.
Call the sheriff for backup.
Be careful!
Neil?
Mr Prescott?
Shit!
Kenny, I need the cellular!
Kenny!
Kenny!
- What's going on?
Oh, God!
Stop!
Oh, God!
Dewey!
Dewey, where are you?
Dewey!
Sidney?
Dewey!
Shit!
7825, suspect at
105 North Avenue 52.
Hello. Help me, please. I'm at
Stu Marker's house on Turner Lane.
It's 261 Turner Lane.
Please, he's gonna try and kill me.
Sidney!
Sidney!
Jesus, we've got to get the fuck out of here!
- Stop right there!
- Don't shoot. It's me!
I found Tatum. She's dead.
- I think Stu did it.
- Don't listen to him, Sidney!
- Stay back!
- Stu did it. He killed Billy!
He killed my Tatum!
- You did it!
- He killed my Tatum!
- No, I didn't!
- You lie!
Sidney, baby, please, give me that gun!
Give me that gun! Christ, man!
No, I didn't. No, I didn't.
Sid, he did it!
He did it, Sidney! Please,
I didn't do it. He did it. Please!
- Please, Sidney. Oh!
- Fuck you both!
- Please!
- No! No! Sidney!
- Open up!
- He did it!
Help me!
He's going crazy!
- Sidney!
- Go away!
Sidney?
Leave me alone.
- Sid.
- Billy.
Oh! Billy. Billy.
Are you okay?
- I'm okay.
- I thought you were dead.
No, I'm like a stuck pig, but I'm all right.
- Get up.
- Help me.
- I'm okay.
- You're bleeding.
- Oh, my God.
- We've gotta get help.
- No, he's out there.
No, give me the gun.
Give me the gun. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.
Careful.
- Please help me!
- Come in, come in!
Stu's flipped out!
He's gone mad!
We all go a little mad sometimes.
- No, Billy!
- Oh, fuck!
Anthony Perkins, "Psycho. "
Corn syrup. Same stuff they used for pig's blood in "Carrie. "
Stu.
Help me, please.
Surprise, Sidney.
- No!
- Ooh!
Oh, now. Whoa.
What's the matter, Sidney?
You look like you've seen a ghost.
- Why are you doing this?
- It's all part of the game, Sidney.
- It's called "Guess How I'm Gonna Die. "
- Fuck you!
No, no, no, no, no.
We already played that game, remember?
- You lost.
- It's a fun game, Sidney.
See, we ask you a question, and if you get it wrong...
"boo-kah," you die!
You get it right, you die.
- You're crazy, both of you.
- Actually, we prefer the term "psychotic. "
- You'll never get away with this.
- Oh, no?
Tell that to Cotton Weary.
You wouldn't believe how easy he was to frame.
Watch a few movies, take a few notes.
- It was fun.
- No!
- Whoa!
- Where're you goin'?
Why? Why did you kill my mother?
Why? Why?
Did you hear that, Stu?
I think she wants a motive.
Well, I don't really believe in motive, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
- No.
- Did they ever really decide why
Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people?
Don't think so! See, it's a lot scarier when there's no motive, Sid.
We did your mom a favour, Sid.
That woman was a slut-bag whore... who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something.
Yeah, we put her out of her misery,
'cause let's face it, Sidney... your mother was no Sharon Stone, hmm?
Is that motive enough for you?
Well, how about this?
Your slut mother was fucking my father... and she's the reason my mom moved out and abandoned me.
How's that for a motive?
Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behaviour.
It certainly fucked you up.
It made you have sex with a psychopath.
That's right. You gave it up.
Now you're no longer a virgin.
I said "virgin. "
Whoops!
Now you gotta die.
Those are the rules.
Let's pretend it's all a scary movie,
Sid. How do you think it's gonna end?
Oh! Oh! This is the greatest part!
You're gonna love this.
We got a surprise for you, Sidney.
Yeah, you're gonna love this one.
It's a scream, baby!
Hold on a sec.
I'll be right back.
You know what time it is, Sid?
It's after midnight.
It's your mom's anniversary.
Congratulations.
We killed her exactly one year ago today.
Attention! Oh, what do we have behind door number three, Sidney?
- Daddy!
- Whoa, hold it. That's enough.
Guess we won't be needing this any more, huh?
And, oh, look at this.
Ring, ring. Won't need this.
- Got the ending figured out yet, Sid?
- Come on, Sidney.
You think about it now, huh?
Your daddy's the chief suspect.
We cloned his cellular.
- The evidence is all right there, baby!
- What if your father snapped?
Your mother's anniversary set him off, and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone.
Except for Billy and me.
We were left for dead.
Then he kills you... and shoots himself in the head.
- Perfect ending.
- I thought of that.
Watch this.
- Ready?
- Yeah. Yeah! I'm ready, baby!
Right! Get up!
Yeah, babe, get up! Hit it!
Good one, man. Jesus.
Oh, shit.
My turn.
Don't forget. Stay to the side and don't go too deep.
Okay. I'll remember.
Fuck! Fuck!
Fuck!
Goddamn it, Stu!
Sorry, Billy. I guess I got a little too zealous, huh?
- Give me the knife.
- No.
Give me the knife!
Now!
You see, Sid, everybody dies but us.
Everybody dies but us.
We get to carry on and plan the sequel...
'cause let's face it, baby, these days ya gotta have a sequel!
You sick fucks.
You've seen one too many movies.
Now, Sid, don't you blame the movies.
Movies don't create psychos.
I feel a little woozy here!
All right.
All right, you get the gun.
And I'll untie Pops, okay?
- Now!
- Okay.
Houston, we- we have a problem here.
- What?
- The gun, man. The gun.
I put it right there, and it's not there.
- Where the fuck is it?
- Right here, asshole.
- Man, I thought she was dead.
- She looked dead, man.
- Still does.
- I've got an ending for you.
The reporter left for dead in the news van... comes to... stumbles on you two dipshits, finds the gun... foils your plan and saves the day.
I like that ending.
I know something you don't.
Fuck. No!
Yeah, man.
Yeah. Aw, so sweet.
It works better without the safety on.
This is Gale Weathers signing off.
Babe, you're gonna love this!
Shit.
What?
Where are they?
Where are they?
I don't know, Billy, but I'm hurtin', man.
Fuck!
Shall I let the machine get it?
- Hello?
- Are you alone in the house?
Bitch! You bitch!
Where the fuck are you?
Not so fast.
We're gonna play a little game.
It's called "Guess Who Just
Called The Police And Reported
Your Sorry Motherfucking Ass. "
- Find her, you dipshit! Get up!
- I can't, Billy.
You already cut me too deep.
I think I'm dying here, man.
Talk to her.
Talk to her.
- Hello?
- Oh, Stu, Stu, Stu.
What's your motive?
Billy's got one.
The police are on their way.
What are you gonna tell them?
Peer pressure.
I'm far too sensitive.
I'm gonna rip you up, you bitch, just like your fucking mother!
- You've gotta find me first, you pansy-assed mama's boy!
- Fuck!
Ow. You fuckin' hit me with the phone, dick!
Fucker, where are you?
You fuck!
- Did you really call the police?
- You bet your sorry ass I did.
My mom and dad are gonna be so mad at me.
Bitch!
My arm!
I always had a thing for ya, Sid!
Bitch.
- I'm sorry. It's all right.
- Oh, my God, Randy.
I thought you were dead.
I probably should be. I never thought
I'd be so happy to be a virgin.
Fucker!
Say hello to your mother.
It's okay.
Guess I remembered the safety that time, you bastard.
Careful. This is the moment... when the supposedly dead killer comes back to life for one last scare.
Not in my movie.
Dad.
Randy, help me out.
- Ow. Aah.
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
- Hang in there, buddy.
- All right.
- Over here.
- Sorry, kid.
Okay, I think it's going to go something like this. Just stay with me.
Hi, this is Gale Weathers with an exclusive eyewitness account... of this amazing breaking story.
Several more local teens are dead... bringing to an end the harrowing mystery of the mass killing... that has terrified this peaceful community... like the plot of some scary movie.
It all began with a scream over 9-1-1... and ended in a bloodbath that has rocked the town of Woodsboro... all played out here in this peaceful farmhouse... far from the crimes and the sirens of the larger cities... that its residents had fled.
Okay, let's take it back to one.
Come on. Move it.
This is my big shot.
Let's go.
Love comes down upon us and it flows like water
Burning with the hope of insight
There the books, the colours of a bright elation
Stolen in the sight of love
We are, we are, we are
We're just children
Fighting our way around indecision
We are, we are, we are rather helpless
Stay kids forever
A whisper to a scream
Birds fly in the eye of the faithless daughters
Spoken at the bitter end
Wasted, sacrificed for the new nirvana
Nighttime sends us on our way
We are, we are, we are
We're just children
Fighting our way around indecision
We are, we are, we are rather helpless
Stay kids forever
A whisper to a scream
A whisper to a scream
Whisper to a scream
A whisper to a scream
We are, we are, we are
We're just children
Fighting our way around indecision
We are, we are, we are rather helpless
Stay kids forever
A whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream
- A whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream
Whisper to a scream
Look outside of my window
But all I see is the rain come down
A pink umbrella and a bit of her lace
Is all I need and I'll come, come
I don't care if you don't care
The world looks just fine to me
Don't be shy and I'll show you, baby
What's it like to be free
I don't care if you don't care
The world looks just fine to me
Don't be shy and I'll show you, baby
What it's like to be free
I
I don't care if you don't care
The world looks just fine to me
Don't be shy and I'll show you, baby
What it's like to be free
- Don't be shy
- Told you, baby
Don't be shy
I LOVE YOU
4th OF JULY CROAKER FESTIVAL
Let's welcome back our six finalists to the stage.
They're pretty as can be, aren't they?
You worked hard. Your parents worked hard. We're proud of you.
She was born for this.
- Her breasts are so... ample.
- She does exercises to pump 'em up.
Guys, I'm on sexist overload as it is. Kill the commentary.
"In the spirit of Mother Teresa, what will be your contribution -
- to your community and the world at large?"
At summer's end, I plan to become a serious actress in New York City.
By entertaining the world through art, I shall serve my country.
Did you feed her this shit?
Work it. Babe!
They're eating it up.
And this year's Croaker Queen is:
Miss Helen Shivers.
That's my girl!
That's my girlfriend!
- How's my hair?
- Hurricane-proof.
It's all about hair. Don't forget it when you become a big lawyer.
Professional women think it's all about brains, and ignore the "do".
The "do" is vital. Got it.
- Are you riding with me?
- No. Tell Mom I'll be home late.
- Is Miss Croaker gonna get sautéed?
- A twit with a wit.
- Julie. A shooter on the house.
- I can't get past the slime.
How about I take you out before you leave town?
I don't think so. Max.
We've been friends since forever.
You can't leave without a farewell.
A toast... to us.
To our last summer of immature.
Adolescent decadence.
- Somebody's buzzed.
- Chum bait. Take a hike.
- Easy, easy!
- Barry, they're just friends.
Come on. This is tired.
- I'm just taking care of your girl.
- Thanks, buddy. Let's blow.
Let's beam down to Dawson's Beach.
A little joyride.
Bye.
They're making out when they hear over the radio -
- that a killer with a hook for a hand escaped from the insane asylum.
- You're telling it wrong.
- Shut up. The girl gets all scared.
She wants to go home.
The boy gets pissed and peels out.
No, the boy goes for help and the girl stays in the car.
- She hears a scratching sound...
- It's not a scratch, it's a drip.
No, the guy's been hung from a tree.
His feet are scratching the roof.
No, he's been decapitated, and the blood's dripping on the car.
No, he wasn't decapitated, he was gutted with a hook.
- That's the way I heard it.
- You're all wrong.
They get to the girl's house and find a bloody hook in the car door.
That's the original story.
That's the way it really happened.
None of it really happened.
It's a bullshit story.
- No. It's not. It's true.
- I don't think so, Ray.
It's a fictional story to warn girls of the dangers of premarital sex.
You know how terrified I am of your I.Q., but it's an urban legend.
And they all originate from some sort of real-life incident.
By that time I'll be finishing my two-year deal on "Guiding Light", -
- coinciding with your first year as quarterback for the Steelers.
Then we can elope to Europe or the Caymans, -
- where I'll let you impregnate me with the first of three children. - 
- before you head off to rehab.
Then we can live happily... blah. Blah. Blah.
Ray? Where did you go?
I'm gonna hook you!
- Do you really believe that crap?
- It's true.
The hook is really a phallic symbol.
Ultimately castrated.
I'm gonna miss you.
You can always ditch Boston and come to New York with me.
We can't all sit in coffee-houses and ramble on our laptops.
- Nobody gets me the way you do.
- I understand your pain.
I hate this.
You're gonna fall for a head-shaven, body-piercing philosophy student.
- That sounds attractive.
- I'll never see you again.
High-school relationships are more successful than any other kind.
Cite your source.
Are you sure?
- Give me the keys.
- Nobody drives my car but me.
I know, baby, but the Croaker Queen has to get home now.
- Hey, you two.
- Give me my fucking keys.
Come ride in the back with me.
I'll let you do things to me.
- Nobody drives my car but me.
- Get in the car.
You can't drive for shit.
Can you say "alcoholic"?
What the hell is this crap?
What's wrong with you?
Watch out!
- What was that?
- Is everybody okay?
- I think it was an animal.
- You're bleeding.
- It's not mine.
- It must have been a dog.
Jesus Christ, my fucking car!
- Can't you see where you're going?
- It came out of nowhere.
- A dog couldn't have done that.
- A deer could.
- My dad's gonna freak on my ass.
- It was an accident.
- If it was a deer. Where is it?
- Maybe it ran off.
- I hope we didn't kill it.
- Oh, my God...
- No way.
- I thought...
- I didn't see it.
- There's no way.
This isn't happening.
Check that side.
I couldn't see it.
I swear!
- Is he dead?
- Check his pulse. You rammed him!
I think he's dead.
- Who is he?
- His face is all messed up.
- What was he doing out here?
- We've got to get an ambulance.
What's your hurry?
- The guy's dead.
- You're not a doctor.
Use your brain, Julie.
If we call the police, we're fucked.
- It was an accident.
- Let's think about this.
Think about what? He crossed the road in the middle of the night.
- You weren't drinking or speeding.
- They won't believe I was driving.
- It's my car. They'll nail my ass.
- That's not true.
I'm drunk as shit. I'm fucked!
We'll call the police and tell the truth.
It's manslaughter.
- We're gonna fry no matter what.
- Then we leave now.
Are you crazy?
- The grille's busted and bloody.
- We can clean it up.
- We're going to the police!
- We don't have time for your shit!
Let's try to stay calm.
If there's some of the car on him.
You're looking at a hit-and-run!
- Then we dump the body.
- You've lost it.
- Let's pretend we were never here.
- We'll dump him in the water.
When they find him, the evidence will be washed away.
If they found him at all.
Maybe the undertow could carry him out to sea.
I won't be any part of it.
I'm scared. Julie.
I'm not like the rest of you.
I don't have the family or money to get me out of this. Please.
This is your future, Julie. Think about college. Your scholarship.
The guy's already dead. If we go to the police, we're dead too.
- What do we do?
- Help me.
They're slowing down.
- Who is it?
- It's Max.
Get rid of him.
- Have you got car trouble?
- Actually...
Barry had too much to drink. We don't want upchuck in the new car.
- It doesn't look so new anymore.
- Yeah. Don't drink and drive.
Daddy's gonna be mad.
- What can I do for you, Max?
- Wipe that grin off your face.
Okay, Max, will do.
Have a good night.
- You got that rich boy act down.
- We'll be seeing you.
Take care. Julie.
Even if his body washes ashore, -
- he'll be eaten by crabs and small fish.
Maybe we'll get lucky with a shark.
Take him to the side.
Put him down.
- Let's do it.
- Wait.
- Should we find out who he is?
- Why?
- Just to know.
- I don't want to know.
Let's just pretend he's an escaped lunatic with a hook. Ray, help me.
- I don't think I can.
- Barry, it's not too late.
- You, just shut up!
- Christ. I'll do it.
Get him off me!
My crown!
He's got my crown!
Over here!
- Let's get out of here.
- We're going home now.
Never, under any circumstances, speak about this again.
It's now merely a future therapy bill. Agreed?
- I'll never mention it again.
- We'll make a pact.
We take this to our grave.
Julie?
- Don't nod! You fucking say it!
- Yeah, okay.
- "We take this to our grave."
- Let her go.
- You fucking say it.
- We take this to the grave.
It'll be okay.
ONE YEAR LATER
It's time to go.
Move your tired, ugly ass.
We're late.
I changed my mind.
Get your white-as-death corpse in the car.
Come on!
You're going home for the summer to get a tan on your pale tail.
Let's go.
Remember. Sun and fun.
Julie? Welcome home. Dear.
I missed you.
How's the snapper?
I really wanted monkfish, but it's been a bad season.
- Are you on drugs?
- What?
I just wanted an honest reaction.
No, Mom. No drugs.
Then what is wrong?
You look like death.
I've had a rough year.
CERTIFICATE OF ACHIEVEMENT
You got some mail.
Your report card came last week.
I know it looks bad.
But the summer session went well.
- It's also your last chance.
- It's not that serious.
What happened to my daughter?
You went away, and you don't call or visit.
Your father must be turning over in his grave.
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID
LAST SUMMER!
Who sent this? There's no postmark or return address.
- Why? What does it say?
- Nothing.
Guys, easy...
It's called glass. It breaks.
Good morning.
Well, look what the cat drug in.
Elsa. Hi. I need to talk to Helen.
Can you give me her New York number?
- Her New York number?
- Yeah. I need to talk to her.
Helen doesn't have a New York number. Try Women's Fragrances.
Frightening, isn't it?
Julie.
- When did you get home?
- Yesterday.
- It's good to see you.
- What happened to New York?
I went for a while.
It didn't really work out.
Somebody sent this to me.
- Somebody knows.
- How?
- I don't know.
- We were so careful.
What if somebody else was there that night?
- Who? It's been a year.
- I don't know.
Has Barry seen this?
- Do you ever see Barry at school?
- It's a big campus. He is back?
- I saw his car at the gym.
- Did you guys break up?
What are you two doing here?
Hi, Barry.
"I know what you did last summer."
What a crock of shit.
- We need help.
- I'll say, you two look like shit.
You're a prick.
- We can't just ignore it.
- How do you know it's related?
- You did a lot last summer.
- Only one murder comes to mind.
You shut the hell up!
- We didn't murder anyone.
- He was still alive.
He was in the middle of the road.
- His name was David Egan.
- Who?
David Egan. He was found three weeks after we...
His body was caught in a shrimp net.
It was in the paper.
I think the police called it an accidental drowning.
But he died because of us.
That's certain.
What about Ray? Have you shown the letter to him? What does he say?
We broke up last summer. Last
I heard, he was working up north.
Let's suppose someone was there.
Why send a letter one year later?
It's probably some crack fucking around.
Max.
- Max, you think?
- Who else? He was there.
You two wait here.
I know what I'm doing.
Go figure. I was just wondering what happened to that Barry Cox.
Hey, Max. Can we talk a second, in private?
This isn't private enough for you?
What?
We got your letter.
- Don't fuck with me. You saw us.
- What the fuck are you on?
I'll say this once. I'll kill you.
I have no problem with that.
- Get off of me!
- Understand?
Motherfucker.
Don't you test me.
I'll call the cops on your ass.
- Did he admit to the letter?
- He won't bother you anymore.
I scared the shit out of him.
Well. I'll be damned.
So Ray's a fisherman.
Yeah, almost a year now.
I work on that one over there.
That's nice.
Have a nice life, guys.
I'm out of here.
Have you got a minute?
I've got to get back to work.
Call me, we can get together.
We need to talk.
- And you think Max sent it?
- Barry does.
He's probably just screwing around.
He doesn't have much else to do.
- So... how's school?
- So, you're a fisherman.
Prophecy fulfilled.
I've become my father.
- I didn't think you knew your dad.
- All I know is he worked the boats.
I know you hold me responsible for what happened last summer.
No, I'm responsible for my own actions. I don't blame you.
But I don't want to know you either.
Hello?
Hello?
I KNOW
My fucking jacket!
Hank, is anybody else here?
Just you and me.
You fucker!
Max, you're fucking dead.
Max, you're fucking dead.
Help me!
Help me! Somebody!
What do you want?
I'm sorry.
I swear. We didn't mean it.
One moment please, Officer.
- Julie...
- What happened?
No. For the fortieth time.
I couldn't see his face.
Somebody tried to kill you.
We have to go to the police.
If he wanted me dead. He could have done it. He's fucking with us.
- Who is?
- Some guy in a slicker.
That narrows it down.
This being a fishing village.
Since you bring it up...
You have a slicker.
- You're not gonna throw this on me.
- This isn't getting us anywhere.
Maybe we should come clean.
No. We made a pact, and we're gonna keep it.
That's insane. Look at us.
The secret's killing us.
We're not going to the police.
We can put an end to it, and salvage a small fraction of a life.
It was murder. Julie.
Your words. Remember? Murder.
- We find this guy and fix him up.
- Like last night?
He's right. This guy won't go to the police. We'll find him, talk to him.
How do we find him?
It has to be a friend or family member of... What was his name?
- David Egan.
- Right. David Egan.
It could still be Max.
- Then find him. Prove Barry wrong.
- I just want for you and me...
Listen to me. Get something.
There is no "you and me".
I can access the local library and pull up all we need to know.
Egan... David.
- All these articles are about him?
- Yeah. Or at least mention him.
Wait. July 5th, two years ago.
What's this?
"Susie Willis drowned, trapped in a car near Dawson's Beach."
- "The driver, Egan, was unharmed."
- I remember that wreck.
Susie was engaged to David.
Her name was tattooed on his arm.
I saw it.
"Survived by his mother, Claire, and sister, Melissa, of Maribel County."
They live in the sticks.
What do you think?
What have we got to lose?
Turn right...
Back there.
Do we just say, "We killed your son and we were nearby, so..."
We play it by ear.
Angela Lansbury always had a plan.
What if they recognize us?
They could shoot us.
They could've done that already.
Jodie Foster tried this.
A serial killer opened the door.
Well, it was a good try.
Adding "breaking and entering" to our crimes?
Can I help you?
Hi. Our car stalled down the road.
Can we use your phone?
- The phone's over there.
- Thanks.
Jodie.
Will you call Triple-A?
You got it... Angela.
My name is Missy Egan.
Are you girls from Maribel?
- No, Southport.
- I went to Southport High.
- You looked familiar. What year?
- Class of '88.
Your name, "Egan", sounds familiar.
Did you have a brother?
I did, but he was younger than me.
David.
- What class was he?
- '92. But he died last July.
- I'm so sorry.
- Thanks.
Do you live alone?
Yeah. I do.
My daddy died a long time ago and my mother's in a home.
She didn't take too well to what happened to David.
Things haven't been the same since he died.
They're on their way.
I could make you guys a cup of tea while you're waiting.
- Thanks.
- That's nice of you.
I think I remember David.
He had a friend. What was his name?
Didn't he hang out with this guy...?
What was his name?
I didn't know too many of David's friends.
There was one guy...
He stopped by not too long after
David's death, to pay his respects.
He was a really nice guy.
He was cute and smart and...
We were sweet on each other for a minute or so. But it didn't work.
He never said it. But I think it hurt him to be around me.
- Where is this old friend now?
- Oh. I don't know.
- Do you remember his name?
- Billy.
- Did he have a last name?
- Blue. Billy Blue.
- We should wait back at the car.
- Don't be ridiculous. Stay.
- I don't want to miss Triple-A.
- We appreciate the phone.
Any time. I don't get too many knocks on my door nowadays.
- Are you okay?
- I wigged out. I'm sorry.
Being in his house and seeing his sister...
- God, do you see what we've done?
- It was an accident.
We killed a man. Then ruined the lives of everyone he knew.
We're not that powerful.
You're giving us too much credit.
- You forgot your cigarettes.
- Thank you.
- I see you got the car started.
- Yeah, it started right up.
Funny how that happens.
- So what now?
- Now we try and find Billy Blue.
Maybe he wanted to die.
- What?
- David Egan.
His girlfriend died on the same road, July 4th, one year earlier.
Maybe he was sitting in the road, waiting for us to hit him.
Yeah, if that will help you sleep at night.
What happened between us?
We used to be best friends.
We used to be a lot of things.
I miss you.
Hey, Dad.
Is the washed-up has-been having a moment?
What do you want?
We're doing inventory tomorrow.
I need you there by 10.
I can't. I'm in the parade tomorrow.
Dad put me in charge of the store, and I want you there by 10.
The outgoing queen has to ride in the parade.
It's tradition.
There's nothing I can do about it.
You and your hair...
It's so pathetic.
- You can leave now.
- So very pathetic.
SOON
What?
Oh, my God...
Max...
- Are you sure he was dead?
- I saw him... with these crabs.
You do it.
He was there. And he was wearing yourjacket, Barry.
- Did the crabs carry him away?
- I believe you, Julie.
- He took the body.
- Why would he do that?
Why did he try to run you over, and make coleslaw on Helen's head?
- Let's go back to the house.
- Where's yourjacket, Barry?
Don't you see? He's got us.
We can't go to the police now.
He's watching us and waiting.
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you doing here?
- I've been looking for you guys.
- You're gonna die.
- Stop it.
- I didn't do anything.
- You're fucking lying!
- Leave him alone. Get a grip.
- Wake up, Julie. He's behind this.
- He's after me. Too.
I got a letter.
A letter? I got run over,
Helen gets her hair chopped off, -
- Julie gets a body in a trunk, and you get a letter. That's balanced.
- You killed Max and took my jacket.
- Max is dead?
You always wanted to be our friend, but were too jealous to handle it.
Fuck you.
We have to stick together.
Help each other.
So if it's not fisherboy here, who is it?
- We think his name is Billy Blue.
- How do you know that?
- David had a friend by that name.
- He's probably a school friend.
According to his sister, that would make him class of '92.
Elsa was class of '92. Maybe there's something in her yearbook.
It's hard to believe that's the guy.
His face isn't splattered on the road.
- Maybe Blue's not his real name.
- He could have lied to Missy.
- If we bring the book to Missy...
- She could point him out.
I'm not going anywhere.
High school mugshots...
- I'll go. You've got that parade.
- Forget it.
- You have to, in case he shows up.
- I don't want him to!
This could be our chance.
We could catch him.
I'll go to Missy's. Barry, you go with Helen. If he shows up...
I'll pound his ass.
- You sound like vigilantes.
- It's July 4th, Ray.
Whatever he has planned is gonna happen today, unless we stop him.
Don't you see? It's that moment where we have to make a decision.
- Let's make the right one.
- I'll do what's smart, not right.
Then let's go.
Leave town. Disappear.
I have disappeared.
Now I want my life back.
We have to face this.
What's it gonna be, Ray?
Barry.
Over there!
Where the hell is he?
Missy?
Please.
Missy...
Do you remember me from the other day? The car trouble?
What are you doing here?
Please. We need to talk.
I need to find your brother's friend. Billy Blue.
- Can you look through the yearbook?
- What's this all about?
It has to do with your brother and last July 4th.
- What about it?
- What happened wasn't an accident.
- I know.
- You know what?
He killed himself.
He went up there to die where Susie died.
The whole town blamed him for her death.
- So he blamed himself.
- How do you know it was suicide?
He left a note.
I hid it from the insurance company.
They don't pay if it's suicide.
That don't much matter anymore, because the money's been spent.
I WILL NEVER FORGET
LAST SUMMER
This isn't a suicide note.
It's a death threat.
- What are you talking about?
- Your brother didn't kill himself.
I saw him. I was there and whoever sent this was there too.
- Where did you see him?
- We hit him. It was an accident.
- My brother drowned.
- "Susie" was tattooed on his arm.
He doesn't have a tattoo.
You didn't see anything. Get out!
Get out of my house.
Oh, my God...
It wasn't your brother.
- I'll be up in the balcony.
- He had a big, huge hook.
Everything's going to be all right.
I won't let anything happen to you.
Nicely done, ladies.
Now, let's meet last year's winner:
Miss Helen Shivers.
As we continue our pageant, we move into the talent competition.
Oh. Jesus.
Barry!
Somebody help him!
Excuse me.
- What's the problem?
- He's gonna kill him!
- Up in the balcony.
- Everybody stay calm.
Get off of me!
Stay behind me.
Nobody's up here. This is not my idea of a funny joke.
The fisherman was here.
He killed Barry.
There's nobody up here.
Let's go back downstairs.
Watch your step.
Ladies and gentlemen, false alarm.
We'll resume in a few minutes.
I'm gonna take you home.
Your parents are worried about you.
You have to believe me.
Let me take you home.
Excuse me.
We'll be needing this.
Come on.
So then he killed him with a fish-hook.
Did he use the same hook to cut your hair off?
No. He used a scissors. Asshole.
I know I sound delusional.
But it's true.
I heard the version with a mental patient with a hook for a hand.
We'll have to take the alley.
Look.
You little shit-stick reject...
There's been a murder. And you'll fry in hell if you ignore it.
I'll contact Barry's parents, and we'll put out a search for him.
He was probably just playing a prank on you.
Oh, Jesus. I'm just gonna see if this fella needs help.
It's him...
What's the trouble?
That's him! Behind you!
Behind you!
"Susie Willis killed.
Trapped in car."
"Survived by her father Benjamin, a local fisherman."
Elsa...
Elsa!
Open the door!
Elsa, open the door!
Jesus Christ, hurry!
What are you doing? Elsa!
Jesus Christ, hurry!
Open the door!
I'm coming.
- The Broad Street entrance is open.
- I'm being attacked.
You're what?
Lock the other door.
I'll call the police. Do what I say!
Elsa...
Elsa?
Elsa, where are you?
Ray.
Ray!
- What are you doing here?
- It wasn't David Egan we killed.
It was Susie's father. Ben Willis.
- But they found David's body.
- I think Willis killed David.
- Then we killed Willis?
- But what if he didn't die?
This is crazy.
Come aboard.
- We have to find Helen and Barry.
- We will.
You...
It's you.
Billy Blue.
You went to Missy's.
- You're the friend. The fisherman.
- I can explain. Julie, wait!
- Wait.
- Stop it!
- Please, help me.
- Easy, child.
I need to call the police.
On the boat! Hurry!
Are you in some kind of trouble?
Yes. I'm in a lot of trouble.
That's a shame.
Being it's the 4th of July and all.
Kids like you should be out having fun. Drinking, partying, -
- running people over, getting away with murder, things like that.
You...
- Ben Willis.
- Good. You did your homework, too.
Welcome aboard, Ray.
Open the door, Julie.
You've got no place to hide.
Come on. Julie.
- Happy 4th of July, Julie.
- Please, it was an accident.
When you leave a man for dead, make sure he's really dead.
We never killed anyone.
This whole year was for...
The guilt was killing me.
I had to know who he was.
That's why I went to see Missy.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but I wanted you back.
I couldn't lose you again.
I love you, Julie.
No one gets me the way you do.
I understand your pain.
Do you have any idea why this man would want you dead?
None.
Here it comes.
Well, don't worry.
The body will turn up.
They usually do.
ONE YEAR LATER
I made the dean's list.
Thank you very much.
I miss you too, but I'll see you in a couple of weeks. I love New York.
Of course I love you more.
You know that.
But I've got to take a shower.
- Julie, you got some mail.
- Thanks. Deb.
A towel.
Don't start with me.
You can ravage me in two weeks.
I love you too. Bye.
POOL PARTY
THIS SATURDAY AT NOON
I STILL KNOW
In such close quarters,
I feel compelled to introduce myself.
I'm Thomas Renfield, Esquire.
Solicitor from London.
English.
My wife and I, we love the English.
Don't we, dear?
I confess I'm not accustomed to these Transylvanian roads.
Feeling a bit queasy.
Queasy? I tell driver to go slow.
Driver...
The sun is setting.
We must make the village before dark. Quick!
Faster! Faster!
Hold on, English!
Yes, I quite understand.
I say, driver, can you slow up a bit?
Yes!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Driver, don't take my luggage down.
- I'm going on to Borgo Pass tonight.
- Yes.
- What are you doing?
- Too dark.
I go no further.
From here on, you walk.
You are going on tonight?
- Yes, I'm going to the castle.
- Castle?
Yes, I'm scheduled to meet Count Dracula.
Dracula?
Scheduled?
Yes, I have business with the Count.
No.
- You must not go.
- Why not?
Because we people of the mountains believe... vampires live at the castle.
- Vampires?
- Yes.
They are the undead.
They rise from the coffins... at night.
Yes.
They take the form of wolves or bats... and puncture the throats of their victims with their teeth... and drink their blood.
Surely that's just superstition.
No. Madame Ouspenskaya is right.
Please, my son... take this cross.
No, thank you.
Take the cross.
Its holy love and spirit of goodness... will shield you from the lurking danger.
No, really. No, thank you.
- Damn it, take the cross.
- Of course.
- That'll be 15 kopeks.
- Okay.
Thank you.
If I have to walk, I have to walk.
No. Don't go. Please. I beg of you.
But you don't understand. I'm expected.
Well, ta.
What?
How do you do?
I'm Thomas Renfield, solicitor from London... to see Count Dracula.
Oh, my. Oh, dear. Oh, no.
Children of the night.
What a mess they make.
I am Count...
Dracula.
- Are you hurt?
- I am perfectly fine.
It would take much more than that to hurt me.
Come.
Come, Renfield.
- Oh, dear.
- Renfield... don't dawdle.
Be there in half a tick.
Yes.
Sorry, I was detained.
Embarrassing, really. I thought
I saw you walk through the web... so I assumed I could.
Then I thought to myself,
"Perhaps I can go around the other way."
But, no.
It was attached on all sides.
- So I thought to myself...
- Renfield, I don't care.
And now, if you are not too fatigued from your journey...
I'd like to discuss the purchase of Carfax Abbey.
Yes, of course.
I have the papers right here.
Very good.
There we are.
- A bit dusty, isn't it?
- Yes, I like it.
Sign here.
And here.
There we are.
Yes, congratulations.
You're now the owner of Carfax Abbey.
One copy for you... and one copy for me.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, just a paper cut.
Oh, dear.
Don't worry,
I have hanky here somewhere.
Let's see, where are we?
How stupid of me.
It's worse than I thought.
I must have nipped the vessel.
My God.
What are you doing to the furniture?
What are you on about?
What's all this, then?
Who are you people?
I'll have you know that's my knee you're straddling.
No, stop it at once.
No, this is wrong.
This is wrong, do you hear me? Wrong.
Wrong me. Wrong me.
Wrong my brains out.
Oh, yes!
What is going on here?
You think this makes me proud of you?
Now go, whilst I make him my slave.
And stop that.
So, Renfield... do you feel better now?
You were having a nightmare.
A nightmare?
But it was so real, so vivid.
Two voluptuous women grinding, heaving.
How to describe it?
- Have you ever been to Paris?
- Yes.
Let me show you an old Transylvanian method for relaxation.
Look into my eyes.
Your eyelids are getting heavy.
You feel that...
Renfield, you fell asleep too soon.
I have more to tell you.
Wake up.
Now, you are feeling drowsy.
What a simpleton.
Renfield, forget about sleeping.
Listen to me.
You hear only my voice.
From this moment on, you are my slave.
You will sacrifice everything for my safety.
In return...
I will give you lives.
Not big lives.
Insects, flies, spiders.
I have chartered a ship to take us to England.
We'll leave tomorrow evening.
I command you.
Watch over the safety of my coffin.
Yes, master.
Renfield!
I'm coming, master.
Master, don't worry. I'll help you.
I have you now, master.
You look poorly, master.
You're all dried out.
Here, you should have fluids.
Yes, I agree.
I think I will start with the first mate.
It makes me so happy to be at the opera.
I love this palace of art and beauty.
Yes, my dear.
The opera is astonishing.
The music is fraught with love, hate... sensuality, and unbridled passion.
All the things in my life
I've managed to suppress.
Sorry I'm late, my dear.
- We were worried, Father.
- Sorry. Sit.
I was detained at my asylum.
The most extraordinary lunatic was brought in today.
The only man found alive on that schooner that drifted into Whitby Harbor.
Absolutely bizarre.
Hello. Can I help you, sir?
Yes, you may help me.
Dr. Seward is in the next box.
It is imperative that I meet with him alone.
You will tell him there is a message for him in the lobby.
A message for Dr. Seward in the lobby.
Good. Now go.
Message in the lobby for Dr. Seward.
And you will remember nothing... of what I tell you.
Extraordinary.
Hello. Can I help you, sir?
"Can I help you, sir?"
What is the matter with you?
- Why did you not tell him?
- About what?
About the message.
For whom?
Never mind. I will tell him myself.
And for your miserable performance... you will receive no tip.
No tip?
That you remember.
Look what's in here.
Excuse me... are you the Dr. Seward whose sanitarium is in Whitby?
- Why, yes.
- I have just purchased Carfax Abbey... and I understand it adjoins your grounds.
Quite so. And you are?
Forgive me.
I am so renowned in my own country...
I sometimes forget to introduce myself.
- I am Count...
- Dr. Seward... there is a message for you in the lobby.
Dear God. What is...
Oh, bother. Excuse me.
Dracula.
How do you do, Count Dracula?
I'm Jonathan Harker,
Dr. Seward's assistant.
This is Lucy Westenra... and this is my fiancée,
Dr. Seward's daughter, Mina.
Count Dracula, it will be a relief to see lights burning... through those dismal windows of Carfax Abbey once again.
Oh, yes. The Abbey always reminds me of that old toast, you know:
"Lofty timbers, the walls around are bare...
"echoing to our laughter...
"as though the dead were there."
I like the way you think, my dear.
That is one of my favorite subjects.
We must get together and have a long discussion.
Very long.
Now I take my leave.
I have a pressing appointment.
Count Dracula?
I'm sorry, my dear... but you have such a lovely ucipital mapilary.
What's that?
This.
Thank you.
And now I take my leave.
There's something otherworldly about that man.
- He gives me the shivers.
- Oh, yes.
Me, too.
Count Dracula... wish we could have that long talk right now.
Excuse us, my dear.
Dr. Seward, Jonathan.
I was sleeping.
We're sorry, but we heard a noise in the bushes below your window.
- We thought it might be a prowler.
- Would you mind if we had a look about?
No. Please do.
- Nothing out here.
- Nothing amiss here, either.
What a relief.
I'm very confident there's no danger here whatsoever.
Sorry to disturb you, dear.
We've searched every inch of the room, and there's no sign of forcible entry.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Something wrong with this latch.
Not to worry. I'll give it a jolly good slam.
Renfield.
- Yes?
- I can't take it. Can you take it?
The lights, the screaming, the crazy faces staring at me.
I tell you, the walls are closing in on me.
- I've got to get out of here.
- Guard, get back to work.
Yes, sir.
Come along then, Renfield.
You're going to have tea with the guvnor.
At last.
Now you'll see, Martin.
Dr. Seward will believe I'm not insane.
I wouldn't bet me last shilling on it.
Let's go.
Stay.
- Dr. Seward.
- Yes?
- Mr. Renfield is here.
- Good. Send him out, Martin.
McManus, the patient in the west wing?
- Yes.
- He's having a conniption fit.
Give him an enema.
- An enema?
- Yes.
It will give him a feeling of accomplishment.
Yes, sir.
Renfield, good of you to come.
Good to see you, old chap.
How are you feeling?
Normal. Perfectly normal.
- Excellent.
- Yes.
Dr. Seward, may I ask why I've been brought to the sanitarium?
We would like to perform a few tests, that's all, if you don't mind.
No, not at all.
As you can see, I'm quite all right now.
Quite so. Hungry?
- Famished.
- Help yourself.
- Such a bounty.
- Yes.
I was just telling...
What was that?
- You grabbed something from the table.
- I did not.
You did. I saw you.
You put it in your mouth.
I think it was an insect.
That was a raspberry.
Raspberry? We're not serving raspberries.
Then it must have been a raisin.
It fell off a muffin.
- There seems to be one missing.
- It's missing?
- Really? Of course.
- Only a raisin.
How extraordinary.
Silly me, it must have been my imagination...
There, you did it again.
You just put a bug in your mouth.
I think it was a spider.
- I did not.
- Yes, you did.
I tell you, I saw you snatch a spider right out of the air and eat it.
A spider? How absurd.
What?
- Dropped my fork.
- Dropped it? You flung it.
What's the matter with you?
Mr. Renfield, I'll ask you what are you doing down there?
Fork found.
- This is most unseemly. I don't think...
- Sorry for the delay.
My God, man.
You're eating insects right from the ground.
What makes you say that?
Because I can see one trying to get out of your mouth.
- Out of my mouth?
- Yes, your very own mouth.
- It's wriggling about.
- Don't be ridiculous.
It's wriggling all over the place.
Poor thing, it's fighting for its life.
I don't know what you're talking about.
If you keep ranting, I'm going to leave.
Me ranting? You're the ranter!
Hello, little darling. Don't be afraid.
- He's cracking.
- I won't hurt you.
- Don't hurt me.
- All I want is your life!
Martin!
Put him in a straitjacket and give him an enema.
Wait. Give him an enema first... then put him in a straitjacket.
- Yes, sir.
- Lives!
Lucy, you lazy girl.
It's past 10:00.
The horses are saddled and waiting.
Mina, I don't think
I could put a foot out of bed today.
I had such horrid dreams.
I feel completely drained.
Darling, you're dreadfully pale.
You look absolutely peaked.
- Perhaps Father should have a look at you.
- Yes, perhaps.
- Father.
- Yeah.
- It's Lucy.
- What's the matter with her?
I don't know.
She's frightfully pale and wan.
Pale? Wan? I best have a look.
I've given you some laudanum, dear.
It will help you sleep.
I see no sign of infection.
Are you sure you don't remember where these marks came from?
An insect? Perhaps a spider.
Do you recall being bitten?
No. But I had a dream.
Yes?
What about that dream?
I remember nothing.
She's asleep.
I must confess I'm completely confounded.
I'm going to take the liberty of contacting Prof. Abraham Van Helsing.
Van Helsing?
I thought he was a metaphysician and philosopher.
He's also a medical doctor. Knows more about obscure diseases than anyone else.
He may be the only man who can help us.
Yes. Contact him, Father.
- Contact him straight away.
- Yes.
Gentlemen, you are about to observe your first autopsy.
It's not unusual for some members of the freshman class... to feel a bit faint during this procedure.
So this is where we begin to separate our future physicians... from those who just want to play doctor.
Now, first things first.
We uncover the corpse.
We make an incision from the groin... to the upper chest cavity, there.
Now, as I open... the abdominal wall, you will observe... that the organs have gone from a nice healthy pink... to a disgusting green.
We must check the intestines... for pathological clues.
So...
Here, pass it along.
Don't worry, there's plenty to go around.
No one seems to be standing.
Hello. I am still standing,
Professor Van Helsing.
Woodbridge, right?
Come closer, Woodbridge.
Good for you. Staunch fellow.
Why don't we have a look at the brain?
First, we crack open the skull.
So... behold the naked human brain.
Examine it.
A good morning's work.
Come.
Professor, 10 out of 10.
Yeah. I still got it.
I have a message for you from Dr. Seward.
A message from Dr. Seward?
What does he say?
He wants you to come to Whitby immediately.
It's an emergency.
An emergency?
Yes, sir. An emergency.
I am awake.
I'm awake during the daytime?
What is happening?
I cannot be up during the daylight.
It must be the young blood from Miss Lucy.
Her blood is still in my system.
Is it possible she has cured me?
Yes. I am cured.
Now I can be up night and day.
It is so bright... so many colors... and the sun is so warm.
Hello, young lovers.
I could not help but smell your lovely picnic.
Could I presume to ask you for a piece of your chicken?
Surely, sir.
- Some wine, sir?
- I never drink wine.
What the hell. Let me try it.
It's good.
Master!
Renfield, look at me.
I'm drinking wine and eating chicken.
What are you doing out in the daytime?
Relax, Renfield. I am cured.
No, you're not. Look.
I made a mistake.
I've got to get back to my coffin.
It's nighttime. Then it wasn't real.
I was having a daymare.
Three tiny puncture marks on her throat.
Three?
Two.
Two tiny puncture marks on her throat.
What does it mean, Professor?
Gentlemen, what I am about to say... will shake the very foundation... of every medical precept you hold dear.
We have entered the realm of the supernatural.
Supernatural?
- Realm of the supernatural?
- Ja.
Lucy has been attacked... by a creature that rises from its grave... and sucks the blood of the living... in order to prolong its own unholy existence.
What we are dealing with here is... a vampire.
- Vampire?
- Vampire?
What are you saying?
I'm saying, "vampire."
Professor, modern science does not admit to such a fanciful creature.
Modern science, pish posh.
She has lost a great deal of blood, ja?
- Ja.
- Yet, look.
Where did all the blood go?
Look at the sheet, the pillowcase, her nightgown.
Do you see anything?
How does your modern science explain "zat?"
Can you explain "zat?"
I can't explain "zat."
No one can explain "zat!"
Are you asking us to believe... that some creature just flew in through that window... bit Lucy on the neck, and drank of her blood?
Exactly.
And tonight... the foul thing will return.
It will suck on her life's fluid... until it has drained her of every last drop.
And if she dies... a victim of this unspeakable creature... she will become one herself.
What?
She will become one herself.
What can we do to protect her from this fiend?
- Seward.
- Yes?
Do you have any books on the occult?
They're right here.
- Do you have Transylvanian Folklore?
- No.
Do you have The Theory
and the Theology of the Evil Undead?
No.
- Do you have The Vampires of Prague?
- No.
Do you have Nosferatu?
Yes, we have Nosferatu.
We have Nosferatu today.
- It just came in the post.
- Here, give it to me, quick.
Here.
- There is a way to protect her.
- How?
"The creature is repelled by garlic.
"Lts purifying effect is anathema...
"to the tainted soul of the vampire."
I must move the coffin or the chandelier.
We brought you down here so you'll be closer to us, my dear.
We'll be just down the hall in the study.
You must get a good night's rest to regain your strength, my dear.
It's the only way to improve your health.
Would an enema help?
Come, we must go.
Sleep well, Miss Lucy.
The garlic will protect you.
Garlic.
- Renfield.
- Master?
It is time for you to serve your master.
- Come.
- Yes, master.
Those meddling idiots.
They want to prevent me from entering Miss Lucy's bedroom.
- I want to take...
- Wait, master.
All right, I'm listening.
They have placed garlands of garlic around her room.
What can I do, master?
I can't leave this cell.
Do you imagine I could not take you out of here if I wish?
That these pathetic bars could stop me?
Wait, master. I'm getting such a headache.
How dare they try to match wits with me?
Me, who has commanded the forces of darkness.
Me, who has called forth the demons of the night to do my bidding.
Me, who has destroyed every enemy down through the centuries.
Renfield? I'm talking to you.
- Sorry, master.
- Come.
We have much to do, and less time to do it in.
Renfield, hurry.
Renfield, I meant for you to use the drain pipe.
I fly, you don't.
Yes, of course.
- Come.
- He flies, I don't.
Renfield, you idiot.
Grab him, Harker.
I'm weak. I strayed.
What did he do?
I caught him lifting up the sheets and looking at me.
Nothing but a filthy pervert. Martin.
Here you are.
Take him back to his cell and give him a you-know-what.
No, not another enema.
Yes, another and another until you come to your senses.
- I'll close the window.
- Yes.
Good lad.
- Are you all right, dear?
- Yes. I'm fine, Dr. Seward... apart from this ghastly garlic.
I'm sorry, dear, but Van Helsing insists.
Oh, Lord!
Lucy...
I command you... open the window.
Come.
Get in there, you filthy degenerate!
I didn't see anything!
I saw everything.
- It's Lucy. Someone was attacking her.
- Wait here.
How is she?
- She's dead.
- Dead?
The vampire has taken all of her blood.
I told her not to leave the safety of the garlic.
No. It's absolutely absurd.
I tell you, we must drive a wooden stake through her heart.
Or else she will rise from her grave to seek the blood of the living.
Lucy was my ward.
I won't permit you to desecrate her body in such a vile manner.
It's sacrilegious.
But, Dr. Seward, shouldn't we at least stand guard over Lucy's grave...
- just to make sure?
- No.
I'm having serious doubts about this whole vampire theory.
For heaven's sake, who in all of England... by the very furthest stretch of the imagination... could possibly be a vampire?
- Count Dracula.
- Well, maybe him.
What? What are you... about?
Count Dracula! Just talking about you, favorably of course.
Forgive my interruption... but I was just made aware of the unfortunate passing of Miss Lucy.
I wish to offer my condolences.
- Thank you. We're all very distraught.
- Yes.
Count Dracula, allow me to introduce...
Prof. Abraham Van Helsing of London University.
He's a doctor of rare diseases, as well as theology and philosophy.
Und gynecology.
I didn't know you had your hand in that, too.
Van Helsing, a name we know even in the wilds of Transylvania.
Count Dracula. Curious.
Are you descended from Vlad Tepes, the first Dracula?
Tepes?
It means "The lmpaler."
He was a bloodthirsty butcher... who inflicted unspeakable tortures on the peasants.
Cutting off their hands and feet, gouging out their eyes... and then impaling them on iron spikes.
They had it coming.
What could they possibly have done... to deserve such barbaric and inhuman treatment?
Yes.
We have a saying in the old country:
They also said:
I'm very impressed, Van Helsing.
You speak the ancient Moldavian.
Well, gentlemen, I will take my... leave.
I say, Van Helsing, you are a man who likes to have the last word.
I will not be drawn into such a childish exercise.
It is immaterial to me who has the last word.
It is getting late.
We will carry on this conversation at another time.
Good night.
Such arrogance.
It is easy to see... why the decadent aristocracy is dying out... in that part of the world.
Gentlemen, our work is not done.
The vampire is still among us.
You must remember, he is cunning.
He has the wisdom of centuries.
And above all, he will never give up.
That man! He never gives up.
Never gives up.
What are you thinking, Professor?
- When did Count Dracula move in?
- About a month ago.
And when did Miss Lucy's symptoms first appear?
About the same time.
Are you saying that Count Dracula is our vampire?
Yes! And no.
- Then what are you saying?
- I'm saying no.
But I'm leaning towards yes.
- Then you're saying yes.
- No.
- Then it's no.
- Not necessarily.
- You sound dubious.
- No, I'm positive.
- Of what?
- My theory.
- And that would be?
- The theory of yes or no.
Good night, sweet lady.
May angels' voices sing thee to thy rest.
Help me.
What's that?
Help me, it's so dark in here.
Who's in there?
I'm alive. They've buried me alive.
Saints preserve us.
Don't worry, miss. I'm coming.
Oh, my God!
They made a mistake, a terrible mistake.
Please help me. I'm so very cold.
You'll be all right. You're alive.
I say, Jonathan. What are you doing?
Just for tonight...
I'm going to stand guard at Lucy's grave, as the Professor suggested.
Surely you don't believe this vampire business?
I don't know what I believe.
But on the odd chance that Van Helsing's right...
I should never forgive myself if I didn't make sure.
All right, go ahead.
But I think you're wasting your time.
Poppycock.
Jonathan.
Lucy?
Come away with me, Jonathan.
I know you've always wanted me... and I have always wanted you.
Finally we can be together.
But, Lucy, I'm engaged to Mina... and you're dead.
I'm not dead.
I'm undead.
Yes, well, I'm not unengaged... thank you.
Jonathan, let me kiss you.
Let me show you the deep, raw passion... of unbridled, sexual frenzy.
But, Lucy, I'm British.
But so are these.
Now we can be together forever.
Back.
Back, unholy demon of the night.
- After her! This is our chance.
- For what?
To destroy her, my boy.
She's retreated to her crypt. Come!
My God.
- Now she's dead.
- No, she's not.
- She's alive?
- She's Nosferatu.
She's Italian?
No, it means the undead.
She's cursed to spend eternity in misery... hunting the living like a wild animal.
What should we do?
For the sake of her eternal soul, we must destroy her.
The only way... is to drive a wooden stake... through her heart.
That's horrible. Is there no other way?
One other. We could cut off her head... stuff her mouth with garlic... and tear off her ears.
Give me the stake.
Oh, no. No, I can't do it. You do it.
It must be done by one who loved her in life.
- I only liked her.
- Close enough. Here.
Good boy. You can do it. Here.
Now place the point of the stake directly over her heart... and hit as hard as you can.
Wait!
Now!
Oh, my God!
There's so much blood.
She just ate.
She's still alive.
- Hit her again.
- No, I can't.
How much blood can she have left?
Go.
She's almost dead.
She's dead enough.
- This is ghastly.
- Yes. You're right.
We should have put newspapers down.
What have I done?
What have I done to poor Lucy?
You have released her, my boy.
Now she sleeps in peace forever.
- Here. Clean yourself up.
- Thank you.
Poor Lucy.
Here.
Keep it.
Essie... your eyelids are growing heavy... with sleep.
Sleep.
Mina, open your eyes.
Arise, Mina.
Walk to the door.
Mina, you are in the closet.
Open the door and come out.
Now walk to the terrace door.
Watch out for the foot... stool.
Stand up.
Not you. Sit.
No, not you. You sit.
You stand. No, sit.
No, you stand.
You walk to the terrace door, and you go back to sleep.
Watch out!
Wait. I'm coming.
Turn out the lights, so no one will see me.
You will be my bride throughout eternity.
We'll share the endless passion of immortal love.
- Oh, I can't wait.
- Not you.
You will be my bride throughout eternity.
We'll share the endless passion of immortal love.
Oh, my boy. Such a night.
- My God, man. What's happened to you?
- Everything.
Professor Van Helsing was absolutely right.
Lucy rose from her grave and attacked me.
And now, at last... she sleeps in peace.
You mean Lucy actually became a vampire?
Yes.
- Where's Mina?
- She's all right. Fast asleep.
- Essie's sitting watch over her.
- Good.
I'll just sit watch myself in front of her door.
Don't you think you ought to get cleaned up first?
Oh, yes. Quite right.
Do you mind using the service entrance?
There's a good chap.
He's covered with blood and there's not a drop on you. Why?
I have been to many, many stakings.
You have to know where to stand.
You know, everything in life is location.
And now we shall do the dance of love.
You're good.
No hickies.
- Shouldn't we rouse her?
- Yes, perhaps you're right.
Essie.
Hello. I must have dropped off.
Good gracious, it's morning.
One moment I was on guard, wide awake... and the next I felt like... a dark cloud came over me.
- Are you all right?
- Fine.
Here we are, then, safe and sound.
It's getting on. I better see to breakfast.
Where'd that come from?
I had the most extraordinary dreams last night.
I feel so different.
You look different, Mina.
Come.
Sit with me.
Closer.
Closer, you silly boy.
Darling, we know each other so well... and yet we've never really explored each other.
Thank God.
Jonathan, I've changed.
I'm not the Mina you knew.
What do you mean, dearest?
I want you to do something for me... something that
I've never asked you before.
- Of course, my dear. Anything.
- Good.
- Touch this.
- Don't mind if I do.
What are you saying?
All right, you don't have to touch anything.
- I'll touch you.
- No!
Stop this immediately.
What's come over you?
- I'm leaving.
- No, please, don't go.
You're right.
Something is wrong with me and it's taking over my mind... and forcing me to say things
I would never say... and do things I would never do.
Jonathan, please help me.
Mina, yes. Anything. What can I do?
Touch this.
Good morning, Mina. How did you...
Jonathan, take your hands off me.
Yes, take your hands off her.
Sorry, sir.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
But she made me do it.
- Is that right, Mina?
- No, Father.
Suddenly, without any reason at all, he laid his hands on me.
- She told me to touch it.
- Harker!
You're a degenerate.
I take you into my home.
You eat my food, drink my wine, but that's not enough for you. Oh, no.
After being engaged to my daughter for only five years... you have the audacity to touch her.
Get out.
- But, sir...
- Out, I said!
- What is happening here?
- Terrible doings.
I found Harker with his hands all over my daughter.
But she forced me to, sir.
She's been behaving rather strangely.
It's as though she's been under some sort of a spell.
Spell?
That's a very lovely scarf you're wearing, Miss Mina.
Yes, I felt chilly this morning.
Excuse me.
May I have a look?
Just as I thought.
Like Lucy.
No, it's nothing.
I accidentally did it while I was pinning a shawl.
Really?
I have something for you, Miss Mina.
A present?
Sort of. Hold out your hand.
Here.
Here.
Look.
What is that?
It is proof, my unfortunate friend... that your daughter has been corrupted... by the evil of a vampire.
We must find this vampire before Mina meets the same fate as Lucy.
But who is the vampire?
Van Helsing suspects Count Dracula.
But it can also be Renfield.
The man drinks the blood of insects... and bent the bars of his cell like they were cheese.
It could be anyone.
There is a way, an indisputable way... to reveal the vampire.
I'm going along with you on this,
Van Helsing... but I think this ball is in extremely bad taste.
Lucy dead less than a fortnight,
Mina's health hanging in the balance.
The ball's been in progress for over an hour.
It appears as if Count Dracula isn't coming.
I hope you're wrong, my boy.
I especially wanted to see
Count Dracula tonight.
I wonder if he suspects something.
Good evening.
- Did I startle you?
- No!
- May I take your cape, sir?
- No, not my cape.
You may take my hat.
Thank you.
We were afraid you wouldn't show up.
I would not miss your gala.
I always keep my nights open for new experiences.
Miss Mina.
She looks especially lovely tonight.
Would you be insanely jealous if I should ask her to dance?
Well, to be perfectly frank... Not at all.
Thank you.
Master!
You're here.
Do not call me master.
- What are you doing here?
- I don't know. They invited me.
I smell a rat.
- Where?
- Renfield.
If I am discovered, we must flee.
Yes. I'll escape. I'll meet you at Carfax.
No. That would be too dangerous.
They will search there first.
I have moved my coffin to the abandoned chapel... at the top of the cliffs.
When you come, make sure you're not being followed.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, master.
- Do not call me master.
- Yes...
Good evening, Miss Mina.
- May I have the next dance?
- I beg your pardon, sir.
Can't you see
I'm having a drink with Miss Mina?
You have finished your drink.
So I have.
Come, Miss Mina.
- Martin.
- Right.
Now!
I can't see him. How can this be?
The vampire... casts no reflection in a mirror.
She's doing quite well without him, isn't she?
Hey, we must be good.
Let's really give them something to watch.
Play the czardas.
Czardas.
They're loving it.
Come on!
Big finish.
You are a very wise man, Van Helsing... for someone who has yet to live a single lifetime.
Get him!
Master!
I mean, mister!
You!
Where do you think you're going?
Professor!
- We must find him before sunrise.
- Why before sunrise?
Because the rays of the sun will destroy him.
He must hide during the daylight hours.
Come, or Miss Mina will be lost to us forever.
Come along, old fly-eater.
We've searched Carfax Abbey from top to bottom. There's no trace of them.
What can we do, Professor?
Where could he be?
I don't know.
We must release Renfield.
He is our only hope.
He called Dracula "master."
I thought he said, "mister."
That was only a ruse to fool the feebleminded.
- No offense.
- I understand.
Renfield will go straight to Dracula.
And we will follow. This way.
You'll stay here till you rot.
Well, you're free to go.
- Free to go? Why? How?
- Good behavior.
But I've only been in here for a moment.
Well, for that moment, your behavior was very good.
Let's go.
Watch your step.
I'm coming, master.
I know what they are up to.
They think I'll lead them to the master.
I must outsmart them.
Lost them.
Gentlemen, we are fortunate.
- Why?
- He's an imbecile. Come.
Master, I'm here.
Are you sure you were not followed?
No, I led them in the wrong direction.
They have no idea where I am.
He went into the chapel. Hurry!
You have led them right to me, you stupid nuncompoop.
I didn't know.
I'm sorry, master. Punish me.
No. Go. Lead them away.
I don't have any time.
No, you must punish me.
Hurt me. I deserve it.
- Not now!
- But I've failed you, master!
I'm a useless, pitiful fool who has betrayed you.
You must hurt me.
All right!
Good, master. Good.
Okay, that's enough.
Why?
Up there!
It's locked.
Break it open.
- Put your weight into it.
- Doctor.
Okay.
They are too late.
Soon you will be my bride for eternity.
Don't stop.
Good, keep it up.
Harder.
The hinges are giving way.
Jonathan, duck.
Back.
Jonathan, get that stake.
A sharp wooden stick, anything.
Back.
Good.
Now drive it through his heart.
Look out!
Arrogant mortal.
You are in my world now... and you will never leave this attic alive.
I will destroy you... and then I will possess she whom you love the most... and there is not a single thing in the world you can do to stop me.
For that you'll watch... while with your beloved Mina
I consummate our marriage.
Grab him. He's getting away.
Grab him.
- Where is he? Where did he go?
- He's up there.
We must catch him, or else all is lost.
Master.
This way.
Renfield, you asshole!
Where am I?
- What's happened to Dracula?
- He's dead.
And you're free.
Thank God.
You're my own sweet, innocent Mina again.
And I have you, my darling Jonathan, to thank for it.
And now, my dearest... let me take you home.
Master!
I'm sorry.
Forgive me.
There.
You're starting to look like your old self again.
Your master is gone forever, Mr. Renfield.
You are your own man now.
- I am?
- Yes.
No one will ever control you again.
- You're right.
- Good.
- Come, Renfield.
- Yes, master.
English
An eight-year-old boy from Manhattan was delivered dead on arrival today-
The Centers for Disease Control.
Are we dealing with an epidemic?
Whatever the carrier, we know that it's not the water.
We don't believe that it's airborne.
One, two, three, four--
Strickler's Disease was first diagnosed two years ago.
We're no better off now.
I needed you to see this for yourself, Dr. Tyler.
It's the same at every hospital in the city.
For the lucky ones, it's a lifetime in leg braces.
Most of these kids won't make it.
We need your help.
Strickler's Disease came to New York... like a thief in the night, threatening to steal... an entire generation of our children from before our eyes.
Dr. Peter Mann, Deputy Director of the Centers for Disease Control--
The killer was cunning. It was deadly.
Neither a cure nor a vaccine could be found.
We at the CDC had to contain it... before it could spread beyond Manhattan Island.
So we went after its carrier, the common cockroach.
Or rather she did.
Dr. Susan Tyler is the reason that there hasn't been... a new case of Strickler's in this city for six months.
Dr. Susan Tyler.
Dr. Susan Tyler,
Professor of Entomology... at the New York State University.
Thank you, Peter.
I don't think I need to tell you
New Yorkers just how resilient... the common cockroach is.
Since it has proven to be virtually immune to chemical control... we had to find a new avenue of attack.
So, with the aid of genetics labs across the country... we recombined termite and mantid DNA to create a biological counteragent... a new species to be our six-legged ally... in wiping out the roach population.
We call it the "Judas" breed.
Once in contact with the Judas' secretions... the common roaches were infected with an enzyme... which caused their metabolism to go into overdrive.
Come on, Susan!
You're missing it.
No matter how much the common roaches ate... every last member of the nest... starved to death within a matter of hours.
I hope someone's taping this.
This announcement's been a long time coming...
- ladies and gentlemen.
- Coming home.
The Strickler's outbreak has officially been contained.
- The epidemic is over.
- Hey, Susan. Honey.
Any other questions?
Dr. Mann, what did this victory mean to you personally?
It means that I can move on to other projects with the...
Our 15 minutes are gone.
And personally it's where I met my wife.
What is this? Is this some kind of Catholic guilt thing?
We don't even know what the impact is of what we did.
The impact is that... a lot of kids will be running around next year because of you.
A lot of kids.
- Hey!
- Maybe we get lucky.
Maybe a couple of them'll be ours someday.
Oh, a couple, huh?
Oh, okay. We're not rushing things.
I didn't want to overtax you.
It's been a hard year.
It's been a great year.
Oxfords. Seven and a half.
Black. Leather soles.
Funny, funny shoes.
Funny--
Can you raise it a little bit on the left?
It's sort of drooping. Don't you think?
Husband, incoming, 6:00.
- I'm sorry I was late.
- Everything crazy out there today?
I got T.B. breaking out all over the city... and the mayor's in my face about scaring off another convention.
It's Bruce.
I'll call him later.
So, nice lunch, huh?
- Very nice lunch.
- Choose.
- What's this?
- Come on, choose.
Oh, honey, why'd you get this?
Baby in a bottle.
It's ours.
Dr. Chadwick said if you take that twice a we--
- Do you know where this comes from?
- Sure.
It comes from the urine of Italian menopausal nuns.
So? Monks bottle their own wine, so--
Not natural, Peter.
Would you at least think about this?
For the last six months...
I've been the one running around with ice in my underwear.
And that's not natural.
I really got to go.
See you.
Hold it right there, sir.
CDC.
Hey, Boss, welcome to disease land.
- Tuck it in.
- All right. All right.
We sure this is yellow fever?
- What, are you ignoring your pages now?
- Listen, l--
Okay, these two cops saw the broken scaffold, and then the paint mess here.
And then they looked through that cellar window.
Go ahead. Take a look.
Pleasant, isn't it?
Couldn't let 'em out until you gave me the okay, so--
This piece of shit chapel here is a front for the Triads.
Chinese mob.
The snake had people in from UNAD.
Slave labor.
How long have they been operating?
I don't know. Five, six years. Too long.
- Oh, have you had lunch?
- Uh-huh.
Try to keep it down when you see this, okay?
Roughly three dozen people were trapped in here.
One toilet, no paper.
We got bacterial samples reading off the scale, though nothing's airborne.
- We got a Reverend Harry Ping.
- Preacher?
Yeah. Preacher, if you can imagine that.
He ran this place.
But there's no sign of him.
So what do you say, boss?
Quarantine 'em.
Quarantine the cops that found it.
Quarantine anybody who touched anything.
Immigration's gonna love you.
Tell 'em to send the flowers to the usual address.
You got it.
Piece of shit on the ceiling.
- Figure that one out.
- Here you go, Josh.
The subway?
You know what?
This is what I love about my job.
I get to travel, see the world... and meet new exotic cultures.
It's... It's all bacterial, but hey, what the fuck, right?
You're gonna be okay.
We'll take care of you.
Hey, she doesn't speak English.
You tell her, please.
Man, she's delirious.
- What's she saying?
- I don't know.
She keeps saying something like the dark angels.
She says they're coming to get her.
Chinese people, man.
They come up with some pretty wild stuff.
- Thanks a lot, Miguel.
- Board up every exit.
If this leads to the subways,
I don't want anything to spread.
Quarantine everybody.
But in the middle of the third date, he tells me that he wears women's underwear.
What a pervert.
This city is full of perverts.
Some of your fans.
- You're the bug lady, right?
- That's me.
We're here to deal.
When you pick them up, you should pick 'em up by this front vein on the wing...
'cause it's the strongest part of the wing.
See, that way you don't break it.
Now, let's see what else you have in here. Oh, look.
- What do we have here?
- Swallowtail?
- Excellent.
- How come you like bugs so much?
Just imagine that you're one of them.
What, eating furniture and stuff?
That's gotta suck.
No, no, no.
Now, don’t judge them too quickly.
These guys were building castles while dinosaurs were still wimpy little lizards.
Now, say you’re him.
He's what we call a soldier.
Now, there is no way that you would ever quit fighting... no matter how badly injured you were.
It would be a battle to the death.
But most insects don't kill... unless their territory is invaded.
You'd just stun your prey up here.
And then you drag it all the way down through here to there... into what is kind of like a pantry.
We eat it alive?
Yeah. You're not really squeamish about those kind of things.
This is the nest.
It's the heart of the colony.
The big enchilada.
- Why?
- If anything were to happen to the nest... the entire colony would die out.
I'd just bail and start my own.
Well, you couldn't do that.
See... that big guy there?
Next to the queen?
Wait. Look over there.
He's the king. And out of all the nest, he's the only fertile male.
He got a good deal.
Yeah.
It's a simple structure designed for their survival.
It's perfectly balanced, and it's very beautiful.
Whatever peels your banana, lady.
So, you wanna buy the butterflies, or what?
You know what?
You guys have done a really good job.
So, how about five bucks?
That's your best?
- I'm gonna show her the weird bug.
- Costs a dollar just to look.
It's a really great bug.
Got it on the subway.
- We kind of broke it a little.
- Okay. My best offer.
Ten bucks for everything, plus a specimen jar, some tweezers and some mounts.
Deal.
Are you crazy? This is the best.
This is our meal ticket.
Come on. Bug's almost dead anyway.
It's yours.
- You gave 'em ten bucks.
- They're from Alphabet City.
There's much worse things they could be selling.
Oh, no. Your papers.
Help me get the window.
Susan. Push.
- Oh, come on.
- Oh, I hate this window.
Okay, on three. One, two, three.
Who the hell do you think you are putting my two officers on quarantine?
Listen to me, Captain.
Those two, they go home... they kiss their wives, they kiss their kids... and I'm the one with a full-blown epidemic--
Come on, Chuy. We have to make dinner.
- Dinner.
- I don't care.
Well, I do care! Jesus, God, I hate cops.
They make the worst coffee.
- Shiny wire.
- Don't stare. People look back if you stare.
I've had limited success with this combination of pheromones... because it tends to wear off.
But now, watch this male when I add sound.
See, this is a female
I recorded in the field.
Look at him go.
It's like the Donna Summer of cricketdom.
Wow. He wants it bad.
Siren song.
If we put these speakers in fields that are overinfested... we can collect the males, save the crops... and restore the balance of the ecosystem.
All without putting harmful chemicals in food.
What the hell?
Shit!
Those kids, we've gotta find them.
- I can't believe this.
- What?
I spend an hour in the field.
I get a weekend's worth of crap.
Oh, speaking of that.
That turd that I took to the lab?
I found these in it.
What are they?
- Buttons.
- Buttons?
Maybe they needed fiber.
Wow.
Oh, my God. You’re just a baby.
Oh, my God.
The transfer of recombinant genetic material... from termites and mantids into Judas breed will allow rapid enzymatic change...
...insuring 100% sterility in all Judas females...
...utilization of a suicide gene...
...leading to a life expectancy of 120 to 180 days.
Not too little... and not too much.
You rub it in.
Around and around.
Like this, huh?
Let the leather take it.
Funny shoes.
Aieee. Mr. Funny Shoes.
No one is there.
It's empty.
Chuy, listen to me.
They have Jesus on the cross... but that is not a holy place.
Can you call me back tonight?
Thanks, Officer.
Cops are on it.
Good.
Well, they said--
Can you do me a favor and hold off working at night for awhile?
I can't do that. I was actually thinking I had to get back...
Susan, someone broke into your office, okay?
I'm sorry about you losing your specimen...
- but let's try and get our priorities straight.
- This is not just a specimen.
I did a pH test, and there are only two species that match what I found.
Now, one of them is a leafcutter ant in the Amazon.
The other one we released here three years ago.
You said--
You said the ones we released only had a life span of six months.
We engineered them to be sterile adults.
The Judases were not supposed to last past one generation.
- So what happened?
- The one I examined today was a baby.
They were designed to die.
They are breeding.
I shine them good.
Chuy, Black Lincoln. Chuy?
Black Lincoln. This one.
Chuy... pay attention, please.
This is where you found the bug?
Yeah, man. But they changed the lock.
You sure you haven't seen one of those?
No. What is it?
It's an ootheca. It's kind of a fancy name for an egg case.
There's probably more, like, weird bugs inside of it.
No way. I see one of those, I puke.
Here you go.
- Here.
- Hold on.
Is there money to be made on this egg thing?
- Sorry.
- Dealing days are over. Vamonos.
These egg things look nasty.
Thought you liked finding nasty things.
Well, what if we go find these things.
She'll pay us, right?
Is that all you think about?
Come on.
This bug. What does it look like?
Did you hear that?
- How deep does this go?
- Let's see.
Let's take a look.
- You see anything?
- Not yet.
Shit.
I dropped it.
I can't reach it.
Let me try. My hands are smaller.
- Just leave it.
- Well, no. Wait. I think I'm almost there.
I already told you this is CDC business.
And I'm telling you that those lockers are MTA business.
Okay, we'll-- we'll pay for the lock that we broke, Officer.
- I mean, whatever we can do...
- Lady, who am I talking to now?
- You or him?
- You're talking to me, okay? You're talking to me.
All we wanna see is...
See what? That's the old maintenance bridge, buddy.
This insect that we are looking for...
Look, man. Your lady want a bug... or its eggs, or whatever she wants, that's fine by me.
But it's like Swiss cheese down there.
Tunnels in, tunnels out, old tracks.
You go messing around, break your neck, and it's my ass on the line.
Lace-up shoes. Black. Nine West.
Chuy, finish your sandwich.
It's good. It's chicken.
Penny loafers. Eleven.
Double E.
Hey.
- He's really good at that.
- Oh, yes.
He imitates anything.
Doesn't he go to school?
He doesn't need school. He's special.
What you making there?
Is that a superhero?
Mr. Funny Shoes.
He knows everything about shoes.
- Hey, I'm talking to you.
- No, you're talking at me!
You come back with the proper permits.
Maybe we'll have a conversation.
- Great. We'll do lunch.
- Yeah, I look forward to it.
Uptown.
What happened?
Napoleon is alive and well and working for the MTA.
We have to get down there.
He wants a permit?
I'll give him a real special one.
What's that?
Is that the egg thing?
Give me a hand.
Oh, man, that smells.
I can hear the bugs inside.
Come on. Cut it.
She's gonna give us at least 40 bucks.
What's up?
I think there's a guy down there.
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit! It's got me!
Help! Oh, God, please! Please, help me!
Alex!
A philosopher named Hobbes once wrote that...
"Life, by its very nature, is nasty, brutish and short. "
An ant would put it more succinctly:
Can I eat it or will it eat me?
It's this kind of simplicity... that governs the phylum Insecta.
Hello?
- It's me. I got the permits.
- You did?
- We're going down first thing tomorrow.
- Okay, that's great.
Listen, honey, I gotta go right now.
I'll call you later.
- ... or of cellular phones...
- Okay. as my distinguished colleague can tell you.
So, you think your little Frankenstein has got the better of you?
I was hoping you could tell me.
I really need to find some answers, Walter.
Dear Susan... is it answers you want from me, or is it absolution?
You still think making the Judases was wrong?
Three years ago,
I would've called it unforgivable.
But I have two grandchildren who are alive today probably because of you.
It would be a tad hypocritical for me to pass judgement.
That's not an answer, Walter.
It's not an easy question.
But as to the Judases...
I think it's likely some survived.
Evolution has a way of keeping things alive.
But they all died in the lab.
Yes, Susan.
But you let them out... into the world.
The world's a much bigger lab.
Funny shoes.
Hold on. Something's blocking filter "D."
Something's blocking filter "D"!
Jules, come on, man. Hurry it up.
Fuck off.
It's not a date.
Oh, God.
What's the problem?
I think it's a kid.
- Yeah.
- Hi, Peter. It's Remy.
- Yeah, hi.
- Is Susan there? I need to talk to her.
- How you doin'?
- Fine.
It's really important.
Yeah, sure.
What are you doing?
What do you got there?
- Where?
- Right down there. In your hand.
- Nothing.
- Oh, are we testing it?
Maybe.
- Are we testing it?
- Uh-huh, maybe. I don't know. Could be.
- It's Remy.
- Oh, good. Okay. So give me the phone.
Come on. Come here.
Give me the phone.
- Are we testing it?
- Yes.
Can you hold on, Remy?
Hey. What's up?
- They found what?
- At the water filtration plant.
- What's going on?
- Okay, I'll be there in about 20 minutes.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
How long you got?
Patience.
We'll just try again.
Try again.
You know, sometimes these things can be wrong.
That's okay. I gotta go, okay? Bye, babe.
Susan, we got the subway thing today.
Yeah, I know. I'm just gonna have to meet you there when I'm done.
Wait.
When you're done from what?
Boots, toys, beer bottles... body parts, cocaine-filled condoms... little baby alligators.
Shit, you wouldn't believe the stuff I'd seen.
Yep.
They flush 'em down. We fish 'em out.
But this thing.
We didn't know what this was.
We were thinking about throwing it away, but then I remembered Remy.
Jeremy plays bass in my band.
Anyway. So--
Yep. I remember Remy says to me...
"If it's got more than four legs, it's not a mammal. "
It's a lobster, right?
My father saw me stay in bed... he'd go get the pitcher of cold water, and whoosh!
I tell you, that's some alarm clock.
Wow.
- How big did you say these bugs are?
- Come on. Hurry up.
You know, my shift's almost over.
I need my beauty sleep.
Man, if I'm blowing off my Saturday, then so are you.
Yeah. It looks like somebody requested you for overtime.
Come on. Hurry up.
Let's find these things.
We've got a long way to go.
All right. Watch your step there.
We've got burrows going down seven stories here.
- No shit?
- Oh, yeah.
It's five stories down, partner.
You fall, I don't wanna come back and pick you up.
Okay, it's all yours. Go ahead.
- It's 48 hours anyway.
- I can't wait that long.
It's 48 hours. Now listen, you got something to write with?
- Yes, yes. I write it.
- You gotta write this down.
Come on. Here's the case number.
It's two-seven--
Wait a sec. Two, seven. Yes, two-seven--
- Eight-three.
- Eight-three.
- All right. You got that?
- What does this mean, case number?
It means I deal with you in 48 hours, okay?
Mr. Funny Shoes.
People actually do live down here?
Yeah, man. The mole people.
This section was pretty popular all the way to Fulton Street.
Tweeked-out crackheads, dopeheads, shitheads, mental cases.
Then suddenly, poof! All gone.
Rumors got started.
Someone found a couple of stiffs.
They make up some crap about a killer.
Overcoat Slim, Long John.
Now, down here is the land of talk.
The wildest version goes the farthest.
This is mole speak, man. Hobo language.
Most of'em, they can't read or write.
They mark out an area with a sign or drawing, and it's as good as closed.
Here, here. See? This one.
This one says, "Go away.
Man with gun. " That's me.
- Yeah?
- Hey, it's me again.
- Susan?
- Yeah.
- Hey, Susan.
- Peter?
Yeah. Susan?
- Can you hear me?
- Barely.
I haven't found a thing yet.
Okay, I have. I have to talk to you right away in person.
How long would it take to get back to the platform?
About 30 minutes, you knock off the sightseeing.
Susan--
I'll meet you at the platform at a quarter to 12:00.
Honey, did you say quarter to 12:00?
Peter?
Susan, the test was positive.
- The test was positive.
- Peter?
Peter, I can't hear you!
Oh, damn it.
The test was...
Susan! Shit. Susan?
She didn't wait long enough.
Hi, Doc. Susan sent you some homework.
I see--
What's this? Look!
The organs are... perfectly formed.
They were functional.
I'm guessing here, and, of course... they don't have a complete specimen, but--
What do you think it is?
This thing... is not just some random mutation.
It's a highly evolved soldier caste... formidable killer.
It couldn't have developed in a vacuum.
It's part of a colony.
This way, this way.
Should have stayed at the office.
- How much longer do we have to go?
- Keep looking around.
It's the size of your palm.
Man. Take a whiff.
- God, it smells like acid.
- No. It's ammonia.
Hey, guys.
There's some weird shit here.
What kind of weird shit?
Lots of it.
Oh, Jesus.
God!
Man!
Go ahead and ask him. Ask.
You seen anything like this before?
Why're you asking me if I've ever seen some shit like this before?
Do I look like I've seen some shit like this before?
Hell, no, I ain't never seen no shit like this before!
Who the fuck would wanna climb up these walls and hang one of these?
Must've been a big elephant-ass motherfucker. I don't know who the fuck...
The Delancey Street station will be closing in five minutes.
Please find alternate routes to your destination.
- Carlito?
- Yeah?
Oh, come on, Peter. Hurry up.
Do you have the time?
Sir, the time?
You know, my father always wanted me to become a dentist.
I said, "No way.
I'm not gonna spend my life looking into people's open mouths. "
What could be worse than that, right?
Oh, man, I've never been this deep.
This is the old Armory Station.
Hey, they built it around the turn of the century.
It's been closed for decades.
- Yeah, I guess we covered everything.
- Hey, look.
You got your shit. I'm happy for you.
Let's get the hell outta here, huh?
Okay, Josh, I want a full team in here by 6:00 tonight.
All right.
Oh, shit!
- What the fuck?
- No, don't!
Look what the fuck you did, man!
You see the size of that thing?
Peter, are you all right?
It's okay, Josh.
It's okay. I think I'm okay.
- Get the hell off me.
- Yeah, I think he's okay too.
How am I gonna get you back up?
I don't know.
See a way up?
- No.
- Shit.
There is no way up.
- Oh, man, that's gonna work!
- Do you know a better way up?
Hey... show that to the station manager.
Tell him Leonard said he's gonna have his bubble-butt... if he don't have someone down here in ten--
Wait a second.
I can't find my way back alone.
Look, look, look.
Just go back the same way we came.
Wait, wait.
- All right.
- Take the first tunnel to the left.
Then go to the fourth, right?
Then right, right, left, right?
Left, fourth-- Peter, can I just stay here and help you guys back up?
Toss the glow-sticks down and just go, Josh, please.
Just keep headin' up.
You're gonna get there.
- Hurry!
- All right, all right! I got it.
Help me!
Help! Please, help!
Help! Please!
Help!
Please! Please! Somebody, please help me!
There were four brothers
Piece of shit.
This is really weird.
We should've seen some track bunnies by now.
- What are they?
- Track bunnies. Rats.
They're usually around.
- They big?
- You damn right.
Yeah, yeah
Got a telegram this mornin'
Sayin' my wife was dead
Show it to Mr. Moore
He said, Might as you know, boy
You gotta plow ol' Red
That white man says,
"It's rainin' and I'm way behind
I may let you bury that woman, Sam one of these old dinner times"
I told him, "No, Mr. Moore"
I dropped what I was doin'
Whoa, I cried till my eyes was red
You know I love that woman
And now she's gone
Could you just knock it off, please?
Knock it off.
- Hey, I sing when I'm nervous.
- Yeah.
Turn these lights back on.
- What?
- You said the cables are still alive.
- Oh, man.
- Maybe we can rewire them.
There you go again.
- What?
- How are you gonna rewire all of this?
- You need a whole crew down here to do that.
- What is your problem, man?
- Do you need a memo every time you take a shit?
- Oh, don't go there.
You better be careful how you speak to people.
Josh?
He wouldn't be comin' from there.
Manny, what the hell are you doin' here?
Hurry.
The lady needs help.
Hey, honey, we're coming!
Oh, Jesus, please hurry.
Please. Come on!
Oh, no! It's coming!
What the fuck is that?
Come on. Get her, man!
Get her! What the fuck is that?
- What the fuck...
- Go!
Look there! There! There!
The car! The car!
Close the door!
Close the fuckin' door!
What the fuck was that?
- Come on. Here. Here, here, here!
- Just wait a minute!
Fuck it! You wait a minute!
I wanna make sure!
It's not dead.
Yeah, well, it's gonna be!
Very soon, lady!
- There it is.
- Drag it out.
- There it is!
- Drag it out!
You better tell me... what the hell's goin' on around here.
Oh, man.
Okay, Leonard. Okay.
It's gonna be fine. You'll be fine.
Okay.
You just stay calm.
Okay, there we go.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Oh, Christ.
- Josh will be here soon. He'll bring us some help.
- You're dreamin', man.
If your boy was comin' back, he'd have been here by now.
- They got his ass, man. They ate his ass, man.
- We don't know that.
And if you think there's not another one of those things out there... what has been puttin' that shit all over the walls?
Listen, Leonard.
If you keep on screaming like that... we're gonna meet the rest of its family.
Manny? Manny, be careful.
- It-It's dead.
- No, no, no.
I emptied two clips into that thing and it kept comin'.
Wait, wait a second. Help me turn it over.
Peter, these are lungs.
What the hell is she talkin' about?
Biology 101. You know, insects don't have lungs.
- That's what limits their size.
- The secretions are the same.
Oh, God.
When I increased the Judas’s metabolism, I must have sped up its breeding cycle.
I mean, we're talking tens, hundreds of thousands of generations.
- I mean, who knows how many mutations.
- Listen, l--
I just don't fuckin' get this.
How could the--
How could the Judas evolve into this?
Think generations, not years, okay?
It took only 40,000 generations for apes to turn into humans.
So?
We changed its DNA, Peter.
I mean, we don't know what we did!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Wait a minute! Hold on!
If that thing has been around, how come--
How come nobody's ever seen it?
I think we have.
Sometimes an insect will evolve to mimic its predator.
A fly can look like a spider.
A caterpillar can look like a snake.
The Judas evolved to mimic its predator.
Us.
Nobody up there knows about this?
Nobody would. Not until it's too late.
These things can imitate us.
They can infiltrate us and breed a legion before anyone would even notice.
How could you do this?
You take something and you make it like a man.
- A man who's not a man, he's a--
- Manny!
- He's a thing!
- Manny!
That steals my child!
Manny, you tell her,
'cause she don't give a goddamn.
- Your kid's gone.
- Hey, shut up.
- My leg's chewed to the bone!
- Shut up, will ya? Shut the fuck up!
- And they're both talkin' about insects with lungs!
- Shut up!
Oh, shit! They're everywhere!
Manny, get over here!
It's the blood!
- The smell of the blood is driving them crazy!
- Oh, shit!
We have to cover the scent!
Manny, give me your razor.
Give me your razor!
Here. Take it. Rub it on the windows.
- Anywhere where there's a crack.
- Wha--
- Just do it!
- Come on!
What the... What is it?
Scent glands. Insects use them to identify themselves.
Here. Rub it all over yourself.
They won't attack you if they think you’re one of them.
Me!
It worked.
Do you mind if...
Go ahead.
Manny, give me your lighter.
Look. This is where we are.
Now, these tunnels may lead to the surface.
- Yes.
- If we can get... this car moving, we might be able to make it.
What--
What do you mean, might?
I mean, probably.
But even if they do... this thing's been down here rotting for half a century.
- How do you know it'll move?
- Listen to me. Listen.
This car is a CR-17 from Coney Island.
Believe me, it was made to last.
Now, Manny... there's a track relay switch in this room here.
- You switch the tracks. That'll get us going.
- Yes, I'll try.
- I'll try.
- Do.
There's a fuse box down the tracks.
If I can rewire it,
I can juice up the whole system.
Leonard, man.
- Look at yourself, l--
- I'll do it.
Hey, if you talk me through it,
I'll go out there.
- All you've gotta do is...
- No, no, no, no. I'll go.
- I'll go.
- Why?
I know much more about what's out there than you do.
You're right.
You understand the creature, and...
Leonard knows the subway, so-- so this is the way it's gotta be.
- Whatever happens, it's Manny and me.
- Why?
You two have gotta stay on this car.
You gotta get back up.
You gotta undo this.
So, I'll go.
We'll go.
Yes.
I have to put this on you now.

You'll find two wires... one green, the other blue.
Okay.

No, man. Leave it on. Leave it on.

Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh--
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
Chuy, it's me.
Come on, Manny. What's takin' you so long?
Do these subway tracks lead to the regular train tunnels... at Grand Central and Penn Station?
Yeah, yeah.
Well, they'll use them to migrate out of the city.
After that, they'll set up colonies anywhere they can.
Fuck.
Now, every specimen we've seen has been female... because a male would be a lighter color and it would have no wings.
And if they are holding true to the Judas’s spawning pattern... the nest will have only one fertile male.
Now, if we could catch that male and kill him... then the females won't be able to breed... and the whole generation could die out.
Where the hell is the male?
Chuy, come here.
Come here. Come here.
Friends.
Come here, please.
Oh, goddamn it! He must be in trouble!
- He must be in trouble!
- Wait. Listen.
- Oh, Jesus!
- I'm goin' out there.
You stay here.
Listen. If the car starts...
I'll meet you at the end of the platform.
Oh, my God.
Oh, Manny.
Yes! Yes! CR-17 from Coney Island!
Goddamn it!
Oh, shit! Goddamn it!
Goddamn! Shit!

Get away! Go away! I'm bleeding!
- Found a way out, on a dumbwaiter.
- Go away!

I can't stop it.
- I can't stop it. They'll be here soon.
- Where's my wife?
- Go away.
- Where's Susan?
- Where's Susan?
- She went to get Manny.
They haven't seen us yet. Don't move.
Peter, go!
- At an old general station
- Oh, my God.
Please send a train
Leonard?
You see
My health is failin' me
And I ain't got too much time
- Come on, Chuy.
- Hurry!

That's all right. That's a good boy.
No, no, it's all right.
Stop. Stop it.
It's okay. It's okay. All right, Peter.

- Peter, what are you doing?
- I gotta stop them here.
Oh, no. Peter, don't do this!
Peter! No! No!
Oh, Jesus! Don't! No!

We're here! Help!
Oh, Jesus.

Why does it have memories?
Well, I'm guessing, but... inherited memories, passed down generationally at a genetic level... by the aliens, like its strength.
Plus a, uh, highly evolved form of instinct.
An unexpected benefit from the genetic crossing.

We get out ofthis shit, you do as you please, all right?
Earth, man.
What a shit-hole.
[ Ripley ]
It's clear.
Hey, Ripley.
I heard you, like, ran into these things before.
That's right.
Wow, man.
So, like, what did you do?
I died.
[ Wheelchair Whirring ]
[ Soldier ]
Not that way!
[ Christie ]
Ripley.
[ Christie ]
Ripley, come on.
Ripley, we got no time for sightseeing here.
[ Wren ]
Ripley, don't.
[ Gasping ]

[ Machine Beeping ]
[ Groaning ]
[ Gasps ]
Hel—
Kill... me.
Kill me.
[ Beeping Continues ]
[ Grunts ]
[ Breathing Heavily ]
Don't do it, Ripley.
Don't do what?
What's the big deal, man?
Fuckin' waste ofammo.
Let's go.
Must be a chick thing.
[ Breathing Heavily ]
[ Faint Snarl ]
[ Hisses ]
Am I dreaming, or is this not the shit we brought with us?
Yeah, it's the same shit.
Stinks in here, man.
Let's keep moving.
[ Screams ]
Get away from me!
Get away from me!
Drop the rod, man.
Get away from me!
- Do it!
- Get away from me.
[ Clangs ]
Get away from me.
Who are you people?
What's happening here?
[ Christie ]
Calm down.
What's happening here is we're getting the fuck off this ghost ship, okay?
Ship? What ship?
Where am I?
I was in cryo, right?
On my way to Xarem, right?
Work crew for the nickel refinery, right?
I wake up.
I know I don't understand.
Oh, God. Uh, I s- I saw—
I saw horrible things.
Look, you're coming with us.
It's too dangerous foryou here.
[ Breathing Erratically ]
[ Sniffing ]
Leave him.
Fuckyou.
We're not leaving him here.
He's got one inside of him.
I can smell it.
[ Man ]
Inside me?
Inside me?
What's inside me?
[Johner] Hey, man.
I don't want one ofthose things birthing anywhere near my ass.
It's a bad risk.
- What's inside me?
- Look, we can'tjust leave him here.
- I thought you came here to stop 'em from spreadin'.
- What's inside me?
- There's gotta be a process.
Can't you stop it?
- [ Christie ] Got no time for that.
- I can't do it here.
The lab is out oforder.
- What's inside me?
I could do him.
Back ofthe head.
Painless.
It might be the best way.
- What's inside me?
- No, there's got to be another way.
[ Call ]
What ifwe freeze him?
What's in-fuckin'-side me?
A parasite!
Foreign element.
There's a monster in your chest.
These guys hijacked your ship, and they sold your cryo tube... to this... human, and he put an alien inside ofyou.
It's a really nasty one.
And in a few hours, it's gonna burst its way through your rib cage... and you're gonna die.
Any questions?
[ Breathing Erratically ]
Who are you?
I'm the monster's mother.
[ Call ]
Look, he comes with us, we freeze him on the Betty,
- then the doctor can remove it later.
- Fine with me.
Since when were you in goddamn charge?
- Since you were born without balls!
- Ease off, people.
All right.
You come with us.
You might even live.
[ Christie ]
Get twitchy on me, and you'll be shot.
Let's move out.
[Johner ]
It's a mess down there!
Is this the only way?
Vriess, we gotta lose the chair.
I know.
Kawlang maneuver, all right?
Yeah,just like old times.
Yeah.
Must be the cooling tanks.
Somebody must have opened the valves.
The nasties couldn't have done this, could they?
We're at the bottom ofthe ship.
We have to go through the kitchen, maybe 90 feet, to the freight elevator on the other side.
- I don't like it.
- What's to like?
This sucks!
- Wren, are you sure about the distance?
- Yes.
- You ready to get wet, partner?
- Yeah.
[ Coughs ]
Hey, uh, do your weapons fire underwater?
- Yeah, they're disposables.
They can take it.
- Disposables?
[ Laughing ]
Hey, I heard about those. Yeah.
- How many rounds?
- Twenty.
Split points give you a good hole, even at the smaller caliber.
Oh. Hey, that's cool.
[ Laughing ]
Yeah. They're big with hitters
'cause you, uh, throw 'em away after thejob.
Nobody likes to throw away a weapon they're attached to.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
Guess I don't have to tell everyone to take a deep breath.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Vriess ]
Hey, Christie, do me a favor.
When we hit the surface on the other side, no backstroke, okay?

It won't break.
Give me yourweapon.
You really are way too trusting.
No!
You killed her!
You bastard!
- I'll get you!
- [ Chamber Clicks ]
Father, lock the door.
- Christie! Climb! Climb!

I'm doin' it, man!

What are you doing?
Don't do it!
Don't!
We can make it!

- Damn!
[ Grunting ]
[ Breathing Erratically ]
[ Alarm Beeping ]
[ Grunts ]
This way.
Come on!
Baby, am I glad to see you.
I was sure that asshole got you.
Are you hurt?
I'm fine.
You got body armor on?
Yeah. Come on.
You took it in the chest.
I saw it.
[ Chuckles ]
You're a robot?
Son ofa bitch!
Our little Call isjust full ofsurprises.
I should have known.
No human being is that humane.
I thought synthetics were supposed to be all logical and shit.
You'rejust a big old psycho, girl.
- You're a robot?
- You're a second gen, aren't you?
You're an Auton.
Robots designed by robots, right?
Hah!
Oh, yeah. That's right.
I remember.
Now, they were supposed to revitalize the synthetic industry.
Instead, they buried it.
[ Chuckles ]
They didn't like being told what to do.
Government ordered a recall.
Now, I heard—
I had— I had heard... that only a few- just a few- had gotten out intact.
Man, I never, never thought that I would see one!
Great. She's a toaster oven.
Can we leave now?
- [ Distephano Laughing ]
- [ Ripley ]
How long before we land?
[ Distephano ]
Just under two hours.
[Johner] Hey, Vriess.
You got a socket wrench?
Maybe shejust needs an oil change.
[ Father ]
I'm sorry. Access denied.
I can't believe I almost fucked it.
Yeah, like you never fucked a robot!
[ Ripley ]
You know, ifWren gets in the computer, he could really screw us.
[Johner] We gotta find a terminal.
No, there's no console on this level.
We'd have to go back.
Well, we can't go back.
- And I don't know any ofWren's access codes.
- Help me.
Call.
No. I can't.
Right. You're the new model droid.
You can access the mainframe by remote.
No, I can't.
I burned my modem.
We all did.
Call, you can still patch in manually.
You know that.
[ Distephano ]
There's ports in the chapel, up there.
Call.
You're programmed for that?
Don't make me do this.
Don't make me make you.
[ Sighs ]
I don't want to go in there.
It's like my insides are liquid.
It's not real.
Get over it.
You can blow the ship before it reaches Earth... and kill them all.
[ Sniffles ]
Just give us time to get out first.
Damn it.
Anything?
Hold on.
[ ComputerVoice ]
Breach in Sector 7,
Sector 3.
Sector 9 unstable.
Engines operating at 41 %.
Eighty-six minutes until Earth dock.
[ Sighs ]
[ Normal Voice ]
We burned too much energy.
I can't make critical mass.
I can't blow it.
Then crash it.
[ Grunting ]
[ Grunting ]
Yeah.
[ Gasping ]
[ Grunting ]
I'm okay. I'm okay.
Really.
I feel good.
[ Call: Computer Voice ]
Ground level recalibrated.
New destination:
Uninhabited quadrant.
Braking systems off-lined.
Acceleration increase.
Time until impact now
43 minutes, 8 seconds.
Try to clear us a path to the Betty... and start her up.
[ Normal Voice ]
Okay.
[ Whirring, Beeping ]
[ ComputerVoice ]
Please wait.
Emergency override in console 45V, Level 1 .

It's Wren.
He's almost at the Betty.

Father, locate the power drain. Report.
Father? Father!
[ Call Over Speaker ]
Father's dead, asshole.
Intruder on Level 1 .
All aliens, please proceed to Level 1 .
You got a mean streak.
[ Groans ]
Damn it.
Let me see.
- Don't touch me.
- Come on.
You must think this is pretty funny.
I'm finding a lot ofthings funny lately, but I don't think they are.
Why do you go on living?
How can you stand being what you are?
Not much choice.
At least there's a part ofyou that's human.
[ Sighs ]
I'm just— Look at me.
I'm disgusting.
Why did you come here?
To kill you, remember?
Before the recall,
I accessed the mainframe.
Every dirty little covert op the government ever dreamed of is in there.
And this-you, the aliens, even the crew from the Betty-
I knew ifthey succeeded, it would be the end ofthem.
Why do you care what happens to them?
Because I'm programmed to.
You're programmed to be an asshole?
You're the new asshole model they're putting out?
Come on.
I couldn't watch 'em do it.
I couldn't let 'em annihilate themselves.
Do you understand that?
I did once.
I tried to save... people.
It didn't work out.
There was this girl.
She had bad dreams.
I tried to help her.
She died.
Now I can't even remember her name.
I guess we're almost there.
[ Ripley ]
Right.
[ Ripley Sighs ]
Do you dream?
[ Call ]
I— Well, we have neuroprocessors that- Yes.
[ Ripley ]
When I sleep,
I dream about them— it.
Every night.
All around me, in me.
I used to be afraid to dream, but I'm not anymore.
Why?
[ Ripley Chuckles ]
Because no matter how bad the dreams get, when I wake up, it's always worse.
- [ Distephano ]
It's not so far now!
- God, I'm so tired.
[Johner ]
Sleep when you die, man.
Oh, no. This is bad, right?
- I think we're near the nest.
- Well, then we'll go another way.
We don't have time.
We got nearly 90 minutes.
- Not anymore.
- What are you saying?
- What did you do, robot?
- Let's go. Come on.
Hey! You want to die here with your little brothers and sisters, that's cool!
But I plan to live past today!
Ifthis little hunk of plastic is pulling any shit,
I'm gonna kill her!
Kill you!
Does that compute?
Or do I have to drawyou a schematic?
[ Gagging ]
Hey!
- You want another souvenir?
- [ Gagging Continues ]
- How far are the docks?
- A h-hundred yards.
Ripley.
Come on.
Ripley, we have to go.
I hear them.
I hear them.
They're so close.
Ripley.
It's the queen.
She's in pain.
- [ Screams ]
- Ripley!
Ripley!
Wait!
Oh, my God.
[ Man ]
We gotta be moving.
The best thing you can do is pray for a quick death.
Come on. Come on.
It's not right.
[ Man ]
I've been saying that all day.
[ Vriess ]
It's up to you now, Call.
I need you to patch into the ship again and open the hatch.
[ Computer Beeping ]
[ Beeps ]
Johner, we should put Purvis in the freezer now.
[Johner ]
All right, little buddy.
Nap time.
[ Screams ]
- Oh!
- [ Call Whimpering ]
Nobody moves, or I put a cap... right where this little droid's brain is.
Distephano, take the weapons.
Begging your pardon, sir, but fuckyou!
Oh, fine. Then I kill her, and you kill me, and we all die, and nobody goes home!
Now drop the weapon.
Then this little synthetic bitch... is gonna plug into the Auriga, and she is gonna take us right back to home base, according to the standard emergency procedures.
- No, she's not.
- [ Distephano ]
Are you crazy?
You still want to bring those things back to Earth?
- Haven't you been paying any attention today?
- Ah, the intellectual speaks.
Stay there!
Listen, ifyou don't—
Don't you ever shut up?
[ Groaning ]
[ Grunting ]
- Why does nobody listen to me?
- [ Grunting ]

[ Gediman ]
I told you.
At first, everything was normal.
The queen laid her eggs.
But then she started to change.
She added a second cycle cell.
So, this time there is no host.
There are no eggs.
There is only herwomb... and the creature inside.
That is Ripley's gift to her: a human reproductive system.
She is giving birth foryou, Ripley, and now she is perfect!

Yes!

Yeah, I get that a lot.
Why are we still here?
Uh, I'm just, uh, finding the, uh, manual override.
- For Christ's sake.

Hey, Ripley.
Good memory. Excuse me.
Ripley's back, man.
Is that it?
Nope.
You can't fly one of these things too, can you?
Are you kidding?
This piece ofshit is even older than I am.

We've still got breach. The hatch.

This is my first time here.
I suppose the military will be sniffing around here pretty soon.
[ Sniffs ]
Bet you're not too anxious to see them.
Not really.
You know, a person could get pretty lost around here ifthey wanted to.
What do you think?
What should we do?
I don't know.
I'm a stranger here myself.

More blood!
Great. Keep coming.
Chuck, Terry, pump away.
Don't be stingy.
Watch that arm.
I can see that fake arm.
Chase, keep that claw really moving.
Jeffrey, jam it on there just like Freddy would.
Good, good. And cut!
Print that, Gretchen.
Chase, you're a genius.
This makes his old claw look like Mother Teresa's mitten.
You better thank them.
They're very sensitive.
Chuck, Terry, great blood.
- Thank you very much.
- Some of our best work.
Hey, monkey man, want to see some neat stuff?
Come on.
It's only make-Believe.
Marianne, I gotta go.
Low bridge.
Let's see if we can scare the P.J.'S off Mommy.
Hey, Heather.
You hungry, Dylan?
Gotcha.
It should have flexed more.
I think the servos got shorted out with blood.
Well, take it apart, pull it out... and insulate them with some styro.
The thing wasn't meant to be submerged, for Pete's sake.
I don't like that thing.
That thing puts bread on our table.
Is it alive, Daddy?
Heather, you're in the next shot.
State-Of-The-Art animatronics with bio-Organic grafting.
Bull tendons, nerve bundles from a live Doberman.
Must've have picked up a signal from an eighties walkie-talkie.
- Sure it's off?
- It's off.
Funny, it's warm... just like a real hand.
Oh, God.
What the hell's going on here?
Cut the effects!
Terry, where is it? Terry!
Chuck, get off me!
Heather, where is it?
Chase, where the hell is it?
Come on.
What the fuck?!
Earthquake. Come on.
Mommy!
What is that?
Car alarms.
You OK?
You OK, chief?
Honey, do you have a fever?
Just another earthquake, Dylan.
Getting kind of fun, huh?
Daddy. Blood.
It's nothing, guys.
It's a scratch. Really.
Where did you get that?
I don't know. Picture, I guess.
When it fell. It's no big deal.
Put a bandage on it.
Don't worry about it.
Geologists at Cal Tech... have confirmed this morning's aftershock...
Do we have to watch that?
...five-point-three on the Richter scale.
Thought you turned it on.
It was strong enough to cause further collapse... of the already badly damaged parking structure...
I'll turn it off.
Officials say that this is normal... following a quake of last week's magnitude... now thought to be a massive 6.8.
Dylan, this is breakfast, not arts and crafts.
What?
Did you get any sleep last night?
More or less.
OK, time to get dressed.
I'm late.
You going away?
Just for a few hours.
Julie will be with you.
Is there anything other than the obvious bothering you?
I think five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
Hasn't been another phone call, has there?
Good sign.
Two full weeks without him.
Maybe he got hit by a truck.
He's closer, if anything.
It's giving me nightmares,
Chase.
Did you have one last night?
It's just the earthquakes,
Heather.
Maybe.
Maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
No. You gotta get back on the horse sometime.
Look, you had a nut case making harassing phone calls.
I know how scary that's been.
No, you don't.
OK, I don't.
But it doesn't mean that it can't be over.
But what if it isn't over?
Maybe you should tell me your dream.
It was nothing. I was... you and I were working on this movie, together for once... and one of your special effects went really wrong.
And Chuck and Terry got hurt... and... well, your fingers were cut.
Right here?
Heather, you were probably half awake... and saw my fingers get nicked when the mirror fell.
Dreams are like that.
Look, if you don't want me to go on this job, I won't.
Just be careful, OK?
I think I can survive two days in Palm Springs... supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial.
I guess so.
You guess so?
Come here.
Forty-eight hours.
I'll be back in no time.
I gotta go.
I love what you've done with the place.
Knock 'em dead.
Dylan, I gotta go.
Take care of Mommy.
Nancy.
Dylan, I don't want you watching this.
Dylan, what's wrong?
What's wrong?!
What's happening to you?
One, two...
Freddy's coming for you!
Someone's coming.
What?
Are you OK, honey?
Is everything OK?
It's just these quakes.
Did you feel one just now?
No. A big truck went by before you opened the door.
It's life on the fault line.
- Hey, tiger.
- Hi, Julie.
Does he feel warm to you?
He had a fever this morning.
No, he seems OK.
Are you sure that's all that's wrong?
Leave us alone, you son of a bitch!
L.A. Limousine, ma'am.
Just wanted you to know
I'm out front.
I'm sorry.
Can you hang on a minute?
What is it?
I don't know.
I just have this weird feeling today.
Mommy? Stay home, then.
This damn caller.
He's started again?
Sick fuck.
Sorry.
Dylan doesn't seem to have a fever.
It's probably just your nerves.
Nerves?
I just meant from the shaker this morning.
Everybody's freaked out about how many we've been having.
And then these phone calls.
Don't answer it.
Excuse me, ma'am, but we are going to be late.
Dylan, I gotta go. Forgive me?
Bye.
I'll call the cops for you.
You've got the number on the fridge, right?
Give them the time they called... and they're keeping this list, supposedly.
Julie, I'm really sorry.
My nerves are a little raw these days.
It's OK.
Yeah. I gotta go.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
You played that girl.
In that movie.
With the guy with the...
Yeah, sure. That's you.
That's what I love about this job.
I get to meet the stars.
I'm hardly a star.
What, are you kidding?
I love your stuff.
The first was the best.
Where the girlfriend's cut open and dragged across the ceiling.
It was awesome.
And when all that blood comes out of your boyfriend's bed?
I thought I'd shit.
But they never should have killed off Freddy.
Heather, look, we gotta go.
Cutting it close, aren't you?
You trying to get me fired?
OK! We're coming!
So, Heather, we're approaching the tenth anniversary... of this whole
"Nightmare on Elm Street" thing.
I mean, the original, five very popular sequels.
How has all the success affected you personally?
I don't know if it really has, Sam.
God. With the exception of One and Three...
I pretty much stayed out of it.
Well, I'm doing a lot more television now... so those hours let me spend a lot more time... with my husband and my little boy.
You have a little boy.
What's his name?
Dylan.
With Dylan, does that change your feeling... your perspective about horror movies?
No, not really.
Would you let him see one of your movies?
My son? No.
I'm sure people ask you this all the time...
Is there going to be another sequel... and what's more, is Freddy really dead?
Of course he is.
Freddy's dead and gone.
And how about your co-Star in the original... would you trust him alone with Dylan?
Robert? I don't know.
Why don't we ask him how he'd feel about it?
We've got a big surprise for you and for our audience.
Let's bring him out.
He is the best of the bad.
Let's say hello to Robert Englund.
Love ya, babe!
We'll do lunch!
I'm alive once again!
Freddy's back! Give it up for your Uncle Freddy!
Just when you thought it was safe to get back into bed!
Give me five!
I'm back, and I'm badder than ever!
You are all my children now!
I got to go, Robert.
Just a second. I'll walk you.
There you go, kids.
- Thank you.
- Bye-Bye.
- You OK?
- I'm fine.
Well, everything went great,
I thought.
We really got you, didn't we?
I don't know why you didn't tell me.
Come on. They loved the expression on your face.
I think they'd like to see us together again.
In what, a romantic comedy?
Just because it's a love story... doesn't mean you can't have a decapitation or two.
- There's a call for you.
- For me?
I'll talk to you later.
Heather, it's Sara Risher over at New Line Cinema.
How are you?
How are you?
This is a voice from the past.
It sure is.
Listen, Heather,
I won't take but a minute.
It's just that we have something to propose to you... and I wonder if you'd stop by the offices.
Bob would love to talk to you.
Sure. When?
No time like the present.
The car will bring you over.
- Now?
-Just take a minute.
You'll be glad you did, I bet.
Bye.
- Can I help you?
- I'm here to see Bob Shaye.
Was Bob expecting you?
Sara. How are you?
- I'm fine. How are you?
- Great to see you.
- You look great.
- Thank you.
Bob is dying to see you.
Can I get you something?
- Coffee would be fine.
- Black?
- Black's fine.
- Could you get us some coffee?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
I think the guy is a little bit of a jerk... but we won't know until we've read the script.
Anyhow, I'll give you a call when I...
Listen, man, I got to go.
Call me when you get to Milan... and don't forget... risotto con tartufi.
It's fantastico!
Take care, man.
I'll talk to you later. Bye.
Boy, do you look great, Heather.
- How are you?
- Great. I'm fine.
And I don't have to ask how you're doing.
Well, so far so good.
Which is why we asked you to come by today.
- Thanks, Kim.
- Sure.
Look, Heather, let me cut to the chase.
How would you like to join us in the definitive "Nightmare"?
I thought you killed Freddy off.
Well, we did, but the fans...
God bless them, they're clamouring for more.
I guess evil never dies, right?
Anyhow, a few weeks ago,
I got a call from Wes... and he pitched me this really ex citing idea... and I started thinking...
"who better to resurrect
Freddy than his creator?"
I thought Wes stopped doing horror movies.
He actually told me he hadn't called in the last ten years... because he hadn't had any really scary nightmares.
They're his inspiration for this thing.
Anyhow, he's right in the middle of the script.
Which means he's having nightmares again.
He's very excited about it.
- The nightmares?
- No, the script.
And you should be, too, because you're the star.
I don't know, Bob.
I'm flattered, really, but I have a kid now.
Well, so?
So I'm not sure about doing horror.
Come on, Heather.
Kids love horror.
Thank you so much, Bob.
I have other things happening.
Look, we'll match any offer that's on the table for you.
No, it's not that.
Look, I have a fan.
Heather, you got plenty of fans.
We've been doing marketing research on you.
You are rating right up there.
We've got Chase working on a prototype for the new glove.
What?
We asked him to kind of keep it as a surprise... until you and I could have this conversation.
How long has Wes been working on this script?
I don't know.
A couple of months. Why?
And since you've been thinking of making it... has anything funny happened?
What do you mean?
Like weird phone calls.
Or nightmares.
Why don't you answer your phone, Bob?
That's what we got people we pay around here for.
Will someone pick up the damn phone?
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.
What the...
Never sleep again.
What is going on?
You didn't let him watch the movie on TV, did you?
Movie? He didn't watch anything on TV.
He was taking his nap, and I heard him screaming.
Honey, are you OK?
Rex saved me.
He did?
Is Rex going to die?
Rex is not going to die.
I promise you, sweetie.
Do you know where the sewing stuff is in the kitchen?
Sure.
We'll do an operation, OK?
Come on.
Dr Dylan and Dr Julie.
Fix him up good as new, OK?
Hey, Chase. You've got a call.
It's your wife.
Chase, you better come home.
Heather, I'm stuck here.
Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.
Why? What's the matter?
- Chase, it's Dylan.
- What?
Hold on.
The phone's breaking up.
What's going on with Dylan?
He's had some sort of an episode.
What?
What kind of episode?
He was just acting very strangely.
Like somebody was after him.
It's scary. It scared me.
He was acting like...
Like what?
Like Freddy.
Heather, has there been another phone call?
Why didn't you tell me you were working on a new glove?
And why aren't Chuck and Terry at work today?
Forget those clowns. Answer me.
Has there been another phone call today or not?
I'm coming home.
I'll be there in three hours.
- Danny, I got to go.
- What's up?
My kid's sick. I got to fly.
"As soon as the sun was up...
"the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.
"'We will bake cookies first,' she said.
"'I've heated the oven and kneaded the dough.
"'Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.'
"And she pushed Gretel toward the oven.
"The witch went to shut the door and bake her inside."
This is so violent.
I don't know why you like these stupid old fairy tales.
Finish, please.
- They'll give you nightmares.
- I like this story.
"But Gretel guessed what the witch was planning.
"'I don't know how to get in,' Gretel said.
"'How am I to manage it?'
"'Stupid girl,' shouted the witch, rushing to the oven.
"'The opening is big enough.
See? I can fit myself. '
"Quickly, Gretel came behind and pushed with all her might...
"plunging the wicked old woman headlong into the flames...
"banging the door shut and bolting it tight.
"The witch howled..."
That's enough.
"The witch howled like a scalded cat...
"but Gretel ran and left her there to perish nonetheless.
"She ran to her brother as fast as she could...
"flung open the door.
'Hansel! Hansel,' she cried.
"We're saved!
The witch is dead."
Time for sleep.
Say how they find their way back home.
- Tomorrow night.
- No. Tonight.
It's important.
Dylan, you know as well as I do.
They followed the trail of breadcrumbs back to their house.
And then their father covered them with kisses... and they were safe.
They were safe, and they could sleep.
- What is that?
- Rex.
Come on.
Rex keeps him down there.
Who?
The mean old man with the claws.
He wants to come up while we sleep.
I keep my feet up here.
Rex keeps him down there.
He's my guard.
You should have a guard, too.
There's nothing down there.
Come here.
Look. See?
It's different when you're gone.
Come on.
On, please.
OK, sweetie.
Night-Night. Sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
- Daddy coming home?
- He's on his way.
He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
Right.
If the birds don't eat them first.
Perfect, perfect, perfect!
Come on, come on, come on.
That's me in the corner
That's me in the spot
Light
Light
Losin' my
Religion
Mommy's scared?
Dylan, Mommy's fine.
It was just a bad dream.
What are you doing out of bed?
Rex woke me up.
He was fighting.
Dylan, go back to sleep, honey.
I'm not sleepy.
Police, ma'am.
Will you open the door?
Heather Langenkamp?
Is Chase Porter your husband?
There was an accident.
It appears he fell asleep while driving, ma'am.
Is he... I mean...
Is he hurt?
I'm afraid it's worse than that, ma'am.
Is he dead?
Yes, ma'am.
Are you sure it's him?
We have his effects.
You can confirm from that.
I want to see his body.
No, you don't, ma'am.
It's not necessary.
I want to see it for myself.
- Can you hand me that?
- Sure.
Excuse me.
- Could I help you?
- Porter.
Chase Porter.
It's back here.
You said Chase?
I'm sorry.
Just sign here at the bottom.
That's all we need.
I'd like to see once again.
I'm sorry?
Could you lift the sheet again, please?
More, please.
What is that?
It was a bad wreck, ma'am.
The head's gonna be all right for the funeral, but...
Hey, lady. You OK?
You sure?
Oh, God. What did that?
They said the truck was tore up something awful... so you can imagine him not being in... well, exactly top shape.
It looks like he was clawed.
That's why we don't lift the sheet past the face, ma'am.
Sometimes it's what we don't see that gets us through the night.
So, if you'll just sign...
God is our hope and strength... a very present help in trouble.
Therefore, we will not fear... though the earth be moved... and though the hills be carried... into the midst of the sea... though the waters thereof rage and swell... and though the mountains shake... at the tempest of the same.
-Julie, where's Dylan?
- I don't know.
Dylan, grab Mommy's hand.
Grab it!
Oh, my God!
Hurry!
Let go of me!
Stay with me.
Stay with me, Heather.
- Where's Dylan?
- He's all right.
He's right here.
- What happened?
- Earthquake.
You got knocked off your feet.
You got a pretty good bump, actually.
May he rest in peace, children.
And may you all get home safely.
Amen.
If there's anything
I can do, Heather... anything.
Thank you, Robert.
Sweetie.
Tina?
Who are you?
Baby, wake up.
Honey. Dylan.
Dylan, get over here!
Honey! Honey!
Come on.
OK, sugar, we're gonna go back to bed now.
No, Mommy, I can't sleep there.
Honey, you have to sleep.
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you!
Where did you hear that?
Did you hear that on that movie?
Did you answer the phone?
Dylan, where did you hear that song?
In my bed.
In your bed?
Under my covers. Kids singing.
Way down there with the man.
The mean man.
What is that man doing?
Trying to get up.
Trying to get up into our world.
Where's Daddy now?
Daddy's in heaven.
He's with God now.
Do you have to die to see God?
I don't think so.
I think you have to pray.
And reach out.
Why does God let there be bad things?
I honestly don't know, honey.
Please try to get some sleep.
Can you come with me in my dreams?
I think that only happens in the movies.
But I'll always, always... be right here when you get back.
And I'll make sure that nobody gets your toes.
I know his behaviour is bizarre... but he's usually so normal and well adjusted, John...
I can't believe it's him... and not something outside influencing him.
Or is that how denial works?
It is denial.
I don't think that's the case here.
If you're really worried about Dylan... have a doctor check him out.
You'll see. Everything's fine.
You're not just saying that to help a crazy friend cope?
Everything about Dylan's behaviour is understandable... for a kid who just lost his father.
How does a child process a thing like that?
I don't know.
I've not been able to process it very well myself.
And you're not crazy, by the way.
Seeing Freddy in that grave and then jumping in... you didn't jump in.
That's my memory.
It seemed absolutely real.
"Seemed," not "was."
It's in my family, you know.
What is?
A very close relative died in an institution.
Really? If having a screwy family made a person crazy... the whole world would be one big loony bin.
You have a crazed fan after you.
That's what's making you crazy.
Probably Dylan, too.
I never mentioned that to him.
Kids know when something's bugging the parent.
You have no idea who this is calling?
- Freddy, for all I know.
- Come on.
He's a man.
Or a boy with a deep Freddy voice.
Six weeks, and you're surprised you got Freddy in your dreams?
Hell, Sonny Bono, after a while... began seeing his stalker everywhere, even at Mass.
Really?
How many times did Letterman call the cops... thinking that woman was down in the kitchen again?
Really gets under your skin if you let it.
You really think Dylan's OK?
Dylan's fine. You're fine.
You're hurting, but you're fine... and you're definitely not crazy.
My worst fear... that whatever madness is in my family I have... and I've passed it onto Dylan.
- Make sure he's OK, John.
- Are you all right?
Are you OK? Are you sure?
Does anything hurt?
Dylan, are you all right?
Honey, are you all right?
Are you sure?
God wouldn't take me.
Oh, my God. Oh, honey.
It's unbelievable.
- You doing all right?
- Hanging in there.
You know the guy that was calling me all the time?
He started again... and he's putting stuff in my mail again.
Listen, the S.O.B. Probably read about the funeral... in the papers or something.
Sick mother.
That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
Actually, it's been giving me
Freddy nightmares.
Wait a second.
Now, let me get this straight.
You're having nightmares about Freddy? As in me?
No. It isn't you. He's scarier.
He's...
Darker?
More evil?
Yeah. How did you know?
Call it a guess.
Pretty damn good guess.
Anyway what I was calling about was... have you seen any of the script by any chance?
No. Wes won't show it until he's finished.
At least that's what he told me.
When is it gonna be done?
The way he's writing, who knows?
It's so weird.
I asked him how far he was at the funeral.
What did he say? Oh, yeah.
"As far as Dylan trying to reach God."
Whatever that means. Weird, huh?
Putting your kid in the script.
Robert... have you been having nightmares?
Look, we need to talk, but not over the phone.
Can I come over?
Actually, Heather... today's no good.
There's something
I have to finish.
Tomorrow maybe, huh?
OK, tomorrow.
But early in the morning.
And meanwhile, Robert, take care, OK?
Yeah. Sure.
Damn it!
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you!
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, grab your crucifix
Seven, eight, better stay up late
Dylan, don't sing that song.
Nine, ten, never sleep again!
Dylan! Stop it!
No! Don't!
Never sleep again
Never sleep again
Never sleep again
Never sleep again
I touched him.
Any history of epilepsy in your family?
Diabetes?
Was there a trigger event, trauma, shock?
You haven't shown him the films you've made, have you?
The horror stuff?
His father just passed away.
I'm sorry.
But I'm convinced those films can tip... an unstable child over the edge.
Unstable?
Dylan's not unstable.
He's just upset.
We'll run a battery of tests and know in a few days.
Does he have to stay overnight?
Absolutely.
Anything more happen we need to know about?
Like what?
Sometimes what a child says or fantasizes... will give a clue to what ails him.
Did he say anything while he was still lucid?
What do we have here?
Too soon to know for sure.
The early symptoms point to childhood schizophrenia.
Dylan, can you hear me?
Dylan, you have to fight it, whatever is after you... and you got to come back to me.
You can't make it alone.
Do you hear?
If you can hear me, tell me what you need to feel safe.
Rex? Is that what you want?
Well, Rex is at home, and that's where you should be.
But you got to get better before they'll let you come home.
Do you understand?
Home.
Home. Home, that's right.
That's where I want you, sweetie.
And, you know, we're not that far away.
Look right out there.
Past the freeway is our home.
But to get there, you have to come out from where you are... so that they'll let you come home to Rex.
And to me.
Time for your medicine, cowboy.
- Here you go.
- What is that?
Something to help him sleep.
There you go. It looks good.
There you go.
Good. Good. Attaboy.
Come on, lie down and take a little nap.
You should get some rest, too.
He's going to be fine.
We're gonna do some tests... and then you can come back later.
Can you get that other side, please?
I grabbed his things.
These are his favourite pyjamas here.
Honey, I've got to go.
I love you, Dylan.
Remember what I said.
We'll take care of everything.
Wake up, lady!
Don't lose it now!
Seismologists at Cal Tech... have counted over 300 temblors so far.
Though most were too faint for us to feel... seven have shaken our community in the last few weeks... and now scientists are speculating... there might be an unknown fault running beneath Los Angeles... a fault that could...
Hi. You've reached the Englund residence.
We're out of town.
You can leave a message if you wish, but... we'll be gone for some time.
I wish I could tell you where the script was going.
The fact is I don't know.
I dream a scene at night,
I write it down in the morning.
Beyond that, your guess is as good as mine where it's going.
At least tell me what it's about so far.
- Coffee.
- Thanks.
I can tell you what the nightmare's about so far.
It's about this entity... whatever you want to call it.
It's old. It's very old.
It's existed in different forms in different times.
The only thing that stays the same is what it lives for.
What is that?
The murder of innocents.
This is still a script we're talking about, right, Wes?
I sort of think of it as a nightmare in progress.
In this nightmare in progress... does this thing have any weaknesses?
It can be captured sometimes.
Captured? How?
By storytellers, of all things.
Every so often, they imagine a story good enough... to sort of catch its essence.
Then, for a while, it's held prisoner in the story.
- Like the genie in the bottle.
- Exactly.
But the problem comes when the story dies.
And that can happen in a lot of ways.
It can get too familiar... or somebody waters it down to make it an easier sell... or maybe it's so upsetting that it's banned outright.
However it happens, when the story dies... the evil is set free.
You're saying Freddy is this ancient thing?
Right. The current version.
And for ten years, he's been held captive as Freddy... in the "Nightmare on Elm Street" series, but... now that the films have ended, the genie's out of the bottle.
That's what the nightmares are telling me and I'm writing.
If Freddy's loose in your script, where's he going?
Another age? Another form?
No, that's not what the dreams have him doing.
What is he doing?
He's sort of gotten used to being Freddy now... and he likes our time and space... so he's decided to cross over out of films into our reality.
Isn't there somebody who can stop him?
Actually there is a person in the dream... sort of a gatekeeper, so to speak.
Somebody Freddy has to get by... before he can come into our world.
That person's you, Heather.
It's me?
Why me?
Dramatically speaking, it makes perfect sense.
You played Nancy, after all.
You were the first to humiliate him, defeat him.
That was Nancy. Not me.
But you gave Nancy her strength.
So in order to get out, he's got to come through you.
He's gonna try to do that at your most vulnerable points.
Oh, my God, Wes.
Did you know?
It was a script.
It was a dream.
I didn't know.
You know damn well it's more than that now.
How can we stop him?
The only way is to make another movie.
I swear, I'm gonna stay by this computer... and keep writing until I finish the script, but... when that time comes, you'll have to make a choice.
Choice?
What kind of choice?
Whether or not you're willing to play Nancy one last time.
"Many of the symptoms of childhood schizophrenia...
"are duplicated in children...
"suffering from sleep deprivation."
"Sleep deprivation can produce trance-Like states...
"mechanical behaviour.
"The child might..."
Rex woke me up.
He was fighting the mean old man with the claws.
You have no idea who this is calling?
Freddy, for all I know.
As in me?
No, it isn't you. He's scarier.
Darker, more evil?
How did you know?
He's decided to cross over, out of films, into our reality.
Never sleep again.
The world of horror films suffered its own terror today... as two of Hollywood's best known special-Effects technicians... were found dead in a vacant field.
Terrance Feinstein and Charles Wilson... two special-effects artists... reputedly working on a top-Secret project... for the makers of the Freddy Krueger films... were found brutally slashed to death early this morning.
Freddy's glove was missing... and police are speculating the murders were the result... of a botched theft... which apparently took place two days ago.
At this point, the murder weapon has not...
Oh, God.
Miss me?
Nancy.
There are no visiting hours this late.
You must understand.
No, I don't understand.
I told you I'm his baby-sitter.
I'm a close friend of the family, damn it.
I just need to see him for a minute.
Sixty seconds. Come on.
You have to understand.
You can't see him.
What are you doing here?
I don't know.
I had this really terrible dream about Dylan.
I had to come and see him.
You must think I'm crazy.
No, I don't.
Is he all right?
I don't know.
They wouldn't let me in.
There are no evening visiting hours in intensive care.
Is he all right?
Dylan? He's holding well.
Earlier he had some problems.
- He's in an oxygen tent now.
- Oh, my God.
Seems we've had an accident,
Miss Langenkamp. May I?
Those are nasty cuts.
How did you get them?
It happened in the earthquake.
I fell.
I need to see Dylan.
In a moment.
First let's see about you.
If these had been a few inches nearer the wrist... what did you say you cut yourself on?
It was the earthquake.
It was dark. I have no idea.
But these look quite fresh.
They are. It happened in tonight's earthquake.
It happened just 15 minutes ago.
You must have felt it.
Guess we lucked out over here.
Your son... is apparently terrified of a man... someone he thinks is going to come out of his bed.
One of the nurses heard him talking to himself.
Do you have any idea who that man is?
I forgot to bring his dinosaur Rex.
He keeps Freddy from coming up out of his... bed.
The man from your films?
Freddy Krueger?
With the claws?
Is that who he's afraid of?
You have let your child see your films, haven't you?
Every kid knows who Freddy is.
He's like Santa Claus... or King Kong or... well, interesting talking with you, Miss Langenkamp.
I hope you understand.
My concerns are simply for the welfare of your son.
How's he doing?
Honey.
- You shouldn't do that.
- Too late.
I'm almost there, Heather.
Almost there.
Daddy!
- Doctor!
- Keep her right there.
We can't hold him much longer.
Get the full anaesthetic, stat.
We don't have that here.
No anaesthetic, you say?
Screw it. I'm going in.
Little booger's full of something I don't like.
Let's get him open, good and proper.
Cut this evil out of him.
- Gloria!
- He's got my baby!
- Who?
- Freddy!
Who?
Freddy Krueger or something?
- What the hell's going on?
- My baby!
Freddy's got my baby.
He's got my Dylan.
I suggest you go home and get some rest.
Your son is fine.
He's downstairs for further testing.
But he was just here.
He was here, you fell asleep, we took him.
You looked so exhausted... frankly, we didn't want to wake you.
Besides, the young woman
Julie is with him.
That's his baby-Sitter, right?
Believe me. Everything is fine.
Everything's not fine.
Damn!
Call security.
Security, code yellow.
Pediatric testing.
This is a restricted area.
Do you have a pass?
Screw your pass.
It's all right.
Where is he?
Just stay calm.
How's her little boy doing?
He's fine, actually.
He came around about ten minutes ago.
He seems to be suffering from acute sleep deprivation.
I don't think she ever lets him sleep.
What are you saying?
Where is he?
I've got someone here who wants to see you.
Are you OK, champ?
Can we go get Rex now?
The bad man's getting awful close.
I know he is.
We're gonna go get Rex right now.
I'm afraid Dylan should stay here until we know... what's causing these episodes.
I'm sure you understand.
Good.
I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna go home and get Rex right now.
You know that home isn't far from here, right?
Right across the freeway.
That's right.
I won't be gone long... and Julie's gonna stay here with you.
Yeah, you bet.
Hurry up, please. I'm sleepy.
I promise. Cross my heart.
But, Dylan... until Mommy gets back... whatever you do... don't fall asleep.
Julie, don't let him out of your sight.
What's going on?
Your hair's turning grey.
Julie, keep him awake.
Understand?
Excuse me, miss.
Would you come with us?
What? Hey!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Get your hands off me!
Do you mind?
What the hell is this?
Just a quick word... for Dylan's sake.
We've had an ex citing day, haven't we?
This one?
Right there.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
You won.
Would you mind stepping outside for one moment?
As a matter of fact, I would.
What are you doing?
It's just a little shot to see that he sleeps.
No. His mother specifically said...
- I said no.
- Do it.
All done.
He'll be asleep soon.
- Would you let go of my arm?
- You bitch!
Hey, you can't do that!
I know what's in that one.
Do you know what's in this one?
Or what's gonna happen to you when I stick you with it?
And I will.
I want you to stay awake, OK?
Keep your eyes open for me.
Come on.
Has there been any use of recreational drugs... in your family?
Or any history of mental disturbance?
What are you asking?
Please, don't take it wrong.
If there was, there's a good chance...
Dylan could be suffering from something passed down to him.
Have you been suffering from any delusional events?
This man from your films...
Freddy Krueger.
Have you been seeing him?
Would you get those keys down here?
I want you to stay awake.
Keep your eyes open for me.
Where's Mommy?
She'll be back. Now stay awake.
There are drugs and treatments,
Miss Langenkamp.
We could... put Dylan in foster care for a short while.
Just long enough to run some tests on you.
Keep your eyes open.
Do that for me, OK?
Come on. You can stay awake.
Stay awake for me.
I want you to stay awake.
Keep your eyes open.
Dylan, what's the matter?
Julie, behind you.
There's nothing there.
Dylan, what's wrong?
Dylan, stop it.
You're scaring me.
I want my son out of here right now.
Very well.
As soon as we can gather the appropriate papers.
You don't understand.
If Dylan falls asleep, then...
I got it.
Dylan, get out of here!
Ever play skin the cat?
Come on.
Help me.
Mom!
Rex!
What the hell's going on?
You can't go in there. No.
Wait, wait.
Code yellow to paediatric testing.
Where's my son?!
Where is he?!
Have you seen my son?
He was just here.
The boy.
No way he's going anywhere.
He's been heavily sedated.
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
- What?
- He sleepwalks, you idiot.
He's fully capable of walking out of this hospital.
Oh, shit.
John, it's Heather.
I need your help.
Why? What happened?
Dylan's run away from the hospital.
I don't know if he's wandering or headed for the house... but I think Freddy's after him.
I know that sounds crazy, but... you're right. That sounds crazy.
Oh, my God.
You know that home isn't far from here, right?
Right across the freeway.
Krueger, you bastard!
Take me!
Are you OK?
You OK?
My son is out here!
Let me go! Dylan!
I'm sorry. What happened to you?
Are you all right?
I'm fine. Have you seen Dylan?
Take it easy, take it easy.
Relax. He's right there.
What happened?
Oh, God.
What's going on, Heather?
What in the world happened?
I know how Chase really died.
- What do you mean?
- Fred Krueger did it.
Yeah. Sure.
You saw him, didn't you?
Coming for you
Nancy, let's go outside.
He'll be all right.
I'll be right back.
What the hell is going on,
Nancy?
Why are you calling me Nancy,
John?
Why are you calling me John?
Nancy, pull yourself together... before you make yourself and that kid nuts.
Would you call Robert?
Robert Englund.
- The guy who plays Freddy.
- Freddy who?
Freddy Krueger.
Nancy, Freddy's dead.
Don't start losing it like your mother did.
I love you, sweetheart.
Don't forget that.
I love you, too...
Daddy.
Get yourself some rest,
Nancy, please.
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you!
Who's there?
Listen, Daddy.
I've got a proposition for you.
I'm gonna get the guy who did it... and I want you to arrest him when I bring him out, OK?
Nancy, just tell me who did it.
I'll go get him, baby.
Fred Krueger did it, Daddy.
Yeah, sure.
Dylan's sleeping pills.
Say how they find their way back home.
It's important.
Breadcrumbs.
Too late, Heather.
Too late.
Join you.
You've given me a way to join you.
Almost there.
"The more she read, the more she realized...
"what she had in her hands was nothing more or less...
"than her life itself.
"That everything she had experienced and thought...
"was bound within these pages."
"There was no movie.
"There was only... her life."
It's just me.
Are you OK? Are you all right?
Where's the man?
I don't know.
He had me, but then he let me go.
Meet your maker.
Pick a pet for the rugrat, bitch.
Fuck you!
Get over there, Dylan!
Take this!
Come here, my piggy.
I got some gingerbread for you.
Gotcha!
Where's your mommy, piglet, huh, huh?
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you!
Come to papa.
Gonna eat you up.
Leave him alone!
Dylan, get out of there!
Push!
Run!
Are you OK?
Honey, honey.
Oh, my God.
We're saved. The witch is dead.
And his mother covered him with kisses, and they were safe.
"Heather...
"thanks for having the guts to play Nancy one last time.
"At last Freddy's back where he belongs.
"Regards, Wes."
Is it a story?
Yeah. It's a story.
Read me some.
"We open on an old wooden bench.
"There's fire and tools...
"and a man's grimy hands...
"building what soon is revealed as a gleaming set of claws.
"And the claws are moving now...
"as if awakening from a long and unwanted sleep.
"Then the man lays one trembling hand flat upon the table...
"and with his other picks up a thick, sharp blade.
"Behind the lights, faces watch from the darkness...
"ready to laugh or scream in terror."
That's a nice dress you're wearing this morning, Misty.
Thanks, Dad.
- Want the entertainment section?
- Not yet, Dad, thanks.
Got any donuts?
Of course not, Chip.
You know they're bad for the teeth.
Always the dentist.
Who wants fruit salad?
Oh, I do, please.
Misty, that's not gum in your mouth, is it?
It's sugarless.
Misty, you know how I hate gum.
All that chomping and chewing.
I'm sorry, Mom.
All right.
- Hey, Chip.
- Mmm?
You think I could get 50 cents for Village People on vinyl?
You might get a buck.
Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.
Who, may I ask, is Carl?
Just a boy.
He's picking me up this morning.
Here we go again.
He's really cute.
Misty, cute is not enough.
You know that.
She sure can pick them.
He goes to college with me.
Leave her alone, Chip. I think it's great Misty's got a new beau.
Chip, honey?
Thanks, Mom.
Listen to this.
"Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison."
That's nice, dear.
Nice? He should have been executed.
Yeah, the death penalty.
He killed people, Mom.
We all have our bad days.
You'd probably date him.
"He's cute!"
All right, that's enough.
Hey, Dad, have you ever seen
Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer?
Oh, sure, Chip.
I most certainly have not.
You've been working in that video shop too long.
Mind your own business.
Well, it better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork.
I do great in school, Dad.
Well, your mother has PTA today.
We'll see what your teacher has to say.
Oh, Mom, I hate Mr. Stubbins.
Don't say "hate," dear.
Hate is a very serious word.
There! Scrambled eggs, anybody?
Who on earth...
- Mrs. Sutphin?
- Yes.
I'm Detective Pike.
This is Detective Gracey.
Oh, come in.
I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What seems to be the trouble, Officers?
Is there a killer loose?
No, son. Nothing that exciting.
Oh, this is our son, Chip, and our daughter, Misty.
Hi.
Jeez...
Oh.
Officer, I'm sorry, but we don't allow gum in this house.
Sorry, ma'am.
We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.
I know Dottie.
She lives right down the street.
Could you take a look at this and...
Tell us of anyone who might be responsible?
I should warn you, this note contains language.
Oh, my!
That... That is the limit.
Let me see.
No, Son. This is a matter for adults.
Officers, I have never even said the "P" word out loud, let alone have written it down.
No woman would.
Officers, life doesn't have to be ugly.
See, look at the birds out there.
Listen to their call...
Chip, there's your ride.
Hey, I'm gonna be late for work. Goodbye, honey.
Okay.
Excuse me.
Hi, Scotty.
Thanks for your time, everybody.
Bye, Detective Pike.
Hi, Birdie!
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Sutphin.
That's Birdie. She's a horror nut, just like my son.
Oh, Birdie, this is Detective
Gracey and Detective Pike.
Hiya, boys.
Bye-bye, honey!
Good morning, Scott.
Hey, Misty, look what I got.
A Pee-Wee Herman doll.
Can you sell it for me at the flea market?
Wow! Still in the box! I sure can!
Oh, God, here comes Carl.
You must be Mrs. Sutphin.
Carl Pageant.
Oh, yes. Misty's date.
Well, more of a friend, really.
- Take it easy, man.
- Bye.
See what Birdie gave me to sell at the flea market?
That guy's a weirdo.
Come on, let's go.
I'll take it.
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, honey.
Oh, Detectives? Here's something you should be interested in.
A grown boy who doesn't wear his seatbelt.
Christ, that one was
Beaver Cleaver's mother.
Oh, leave her alone.
Mrs. Sutphin's about as normal and nice a lady as we're ever gonna find.
Hello?
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
God damn you! Stop calling here.
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
You bitch!
Now let me check the zip code. 212-fuck you!
Beverly? Beverly, darling? You home?
The police are tracing this call this very minute.
Well, Dottie Hinkle, then why aren't they here, huh, fuck-face?
Fuck you!
Beverly, you home?
I know you are.
Beverly?
Hmm.
Didn't I just say fuck you?
I beg your pardon.
Who is this?
Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company.
I understand you're having problems with an obscene phone caller?
Yes, I am. I'm sorry, Mrs. Wilson, but this is driving me crazy.
I've had my number changed twice already.
I'm a divorced woman.
Please help me.
Beverly?
Well, what exactly does this sick individual say to you?
I can't say the words out loud.
I don't use bad language.
Oh, well, I know it's difficult, but we need to know the exact words.
I'll try.
Cocksucker. That's what she calls me.
Listen to your filthy mouth, you fucking whore!
God damn you!
Motherfucker.
Cocksucker!
- Beverly?
- Rosemary.
Are you all right?
Oh, yes, of course. I'm fine.
Oh, how nice. You remembered.
It's the least I could do.
I heard shouting.
Oh, it's that cable TV company.
You know how they are.
Did you hear about poor Dottie Hinkle?
Yes, I did. It's terrifying.
The police were at my house this morning.
Now who on earth would want to harass poor Dottie Hinkle?
Bye-bye.
But, Mr. Stubbins, my son studies every night.
He's trying as hard as he can.
Well, some teenagers just aren't college material, Mrs. Taplotter.
It's nothing to cry over.
Now, there are other parents waiting.
Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
- Hi, Betty.
- Oh, hi, Beverly.
Oh, I love your outfit.
Oh, thanks.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Liz Claiborne.
Well, Mrs. Sutphin, where's that husband of yours?
Feeling a little down in the mouth?
Oh, Ralph. You're so funny.
Oh, brother.
Mrs. Sutphin?
Yes, right here.
Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul
Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
Here's a little something that I made.
Oh.
Fruitcake. Well, thank you, Mrs. Sutphin.
Have a seat.
Oh, yes.
Well, Chip's off to a fine start this year.
He's focused, conscientious, he participates actively in classroom discussions...
He's a good boy.
There is one big problem, though.
What is it?
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
Oh, no.
Chip's the assistant manager at a video store...
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination.
I caught him drawing this in class last week.
Is there a problem at home?
Of course not.
Divorce? Alcoholic relative?
Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
No, he did not.
Mr. Stubbins, we are a loving and supportive family.
Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin.
I'd recommend therapy for your son.
Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
- Watch this.
- No, thanks.
Scotty, watch this.
It's a sheep's tongue.
This shit is sickening.
Come on, put on some pussy.
Look, dickhead...
Blood Feast.
The Citizen Kane of gore movies.
I don't know what it is about today, but I feel great! Cookie?
Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.
Hi, guys.
Look how fake that looks.
Oh, you kids. Here, have a cookie and run on home.
But, Mom, the video's not over.
Don't you "but, Mom" me.
Mr. Stubbins seems to think that these silly movies are interfering with your schoolwork.
Oh, boy.
Mom, Mr. Stubbins sucks.
Man! That one made me puke!
It's supposed to make you puke.
You forgot something.
Are we leaving?
Yes, you are.
Bye, Mrs. Sutphin.
Bye, Birdie.
Bye, Bird-Brain. See you, Scotty.
Now, Chip, honey, I know how hard it is being a teenager.
I understand. I'm your mother and I love you.
Mom...
Oh, could we watch that scene again?
You know the one, where he rips her heart out? Please?
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf.
It looks good, Mom.
Nothing like a home-cooked meal, honey.
Oh, Misty, I made you your favorite, sesame broccoli.
You know, Carl says if I lose 10 pounds, he'll take me to the University of
Maryland Memorial Day Beach Blast.
Well, honey, I think that's great if you wanna lose weight, but I think you should do it for yourself, not for some boy you hardly even know.
Carl's a jerk.
He certainly drives like a jerk.
Carl makes me happy and that threatens this family, doesn't it?
It doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy.
I'm happy, too.
We just want you to be happy.
I'm so happy I could shit.
Chip, you know how I hate the brown word.
Beverly! Beverly!
Beverly!
That's Rosemary.
Something must be wrong.
Turn on the news. A teacher at your school has been murdered.
- Murdered?
- Who?
A Mr. Stuber or Stubin...
Mr. Stubbins!
That's my math teacher. Dad...
Which channel?
It's on all of them!
Police claim the driver of the hit-and-run vehicle
- ran down the teacher in cold blood.
- Hello?
- Did you hear?
- What happened?
This is so cool. It's just like a horror movie.
- It's on. I'll call you back.
- Okay, bye.
Mr. Paul Stubbins was 38 years old.
Whoever did this should get the death penalty.
So far only one eyewitness has surfaced.
Young lady, what did you see?
It was a blue car.
That's Lu-Ann Hodges.
She's a stoner.
A what?
A pothead, Mom.
A blue station wagon.
That's like your car, Beverly.
Rosemary, I'm not that bad a driver.
In a second, man.
It flattened Mr. Stubbins just like a pancake!
Oh, God, man, puke time, man.
Oh, look at her hair.
Blood was all over the place and...
Turn it off, honey.
I can't believe
Mr. Stubbins is dead.
You said you hated him.
Well, he was an asshole, but he didn't deserve to die.
I can't stop thinking about that poor teacher.
Well, good night, honey.
Good night, dear.
Don't read too late.
We've got a big day with the birds tomorrow.
Oh, I've identified every little birdie that we're gonna see tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.
Good night, honey.
Hey, don't I get a good night kiss?
I thought with all this sadness, you wouldn't wanna...
We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
It's all right with me, Beverly.
You want to, honey?
You think the kids are awake?
We could be very quiet.
I love that you're my wife.
You're not so bad yourself, cuckoo bird.
You bring me such peace.
Don't wake the kids.
Oh, honey, you are hot tonight.
Oh, yeah!
Quiet!
Oh, yeah!
Yeah!
Oh, get it! Honey, I'm ready!
Now! Now...
Oh, yeah! Yes!
Now!
Oh, there's DeeDee. Oh, she's my favorite starling.
She's here every morning for breakfast.
Well, honey, starlings are originally from Europe, you know.
No wonder DeeDee's hungry.
It's a long journey all the way here to Baltimore.
Hello?
Eugene, this is Ralph Sterner.
I've got a dental emergency here.
I mean, this goddamn tooth is killing me.
Well, Mr. Sterner, if you'll just call my office,
I'm sure we can see you on Monday.
Monday?
Eugene, this is Betty Sterner.
He'll die by Monday.
I mean, the roots are infected.
He might have a heart attack.
All right, Mrs. Sterner. 10:00.
I'm sorry, honey, but the birds will still be there next week.
It's okay. I understand.
I'll go fix breakfast.
Chip!
God! Mom, what's the matter?
Oh, it's just time to get up, that's all.
I don't want you to be late for work.
You scared me.
Misty, honey, what's wrong?
I'm stood up.
I'll kill that bastard.
I mean it.
He should be dead, that lousy creep.
He told me he'd be here.
I'll kill him.
Don't use words unless you mean them, Misty, honey.
It's him!
No, no. It's the police.
Good morning, Officers.
Good morning, Mrs. Sutphin.
Hi, Detective Pike.
Morning, Misty.
Mrs. Sutphin, I presume you know about the death of Mr. Stubbins.
Oh, yes, yes. A fine man, a good teacher.
Contusions, fractures, rupture of numerous vital organs.
What a mess.
Oh, no, no, honey. That's Scotty.
Scotty, who doesn't wear his seatbelt.
Good morning, Detectives.
Nightmare on Calverton Court.
The Maryland Teacher Massacre.
It's not funny, son.
Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
Yes, I did.
Detectives, what is this all about?
I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicles computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
Surely, you don't think that
Beverly was involved in this?
She did it!
Aimed the car right at
Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!
Shut up, Scotty.
Well, as I understand it, the only eyewitness was a drug user.
I got somebody you could run over, Mother.
Misty, that's a terrible thing to say.
Detectives, it's time for you to leave.
My wife knows nothing about this terrible accident.
Murder, honey.
Oh! Now here's a babe.
Let's see that, young man.
"P," as in...
People who don't mind their own business.
Darling, it's Rosemary Ackerman's.
Oh, you can tell by the subscription label.
I don't like to read about movies.
They're so violent.
Besides, I always recycle my magazines.
Daybreak if you wanna believe
It can be daybreak
Ain't no time to grieve
'Cause it's daybreak
If you'll only believe
And let it shine, shine, shine
Wait for me, boys! Here! All rinsed and ready to recycle.
Morning, Mrs. Sutphin.
Good morning, Gus.
Good morning, Sloppy.
You know, you boys work so hard for the environment,
I thought I'd bring you something.
A little drink never hurt anybody.
Thank you, ma'am.
Damn, that's good stuff.
You believe that goddamn litterbugger?
I have told her and told her.
It takes 90 to 100 years for a tin canto decompose and she still won't recycle.
It cost the taxpayers millions of dollars last year, but she don't care nothing about the national budget.
I hate Mrs. Ackerman.
I hate her, too.
I hate her guts.
You know, somebody ought to kill her.
Yeah.
Give her a happy face, and then recycle her.
For the sake of this planet, somebody just might.
But your boyfriend was convicted of killing 12 people.
I don't judge him.
I just don't get it. I mean, how can you love a mass murderer?
Easy. He's handsome, he's famous and we get conjugal visits.
Serial hags. Women who love men who mutilate.
We'll be right back after this, so please stay tuned.
Turn it off. Violence is everywhere these days.
It's just Beverly.
Come in, Beverly!
Oh, she scared me.
- Hi!
- Hi, Rosemary.
Would you like a beer?
Oh, no, no. Not me. Thank you.
Just a little coffee.
Oh, Dottie, I'm so sorry.
I heard about your troubles.
It's not fair.
No.
Mmm. Oh, thank you.
Are those pussy willows?
Dried ones.
Aren't they pretty?
What did you just say?
Pussy willows, Dottie.
Oh, my goodness!
What are you doing?
I didn't do it!
My Franklin Mint Fabergé egg!
Dottie didn't mean to be such a clumsy ox.
You're sorry aren't you, Dottie?
Rosemary, I did not break your egg!
She did!
Dottie, you could at least apologize.
I collect Franklin Mint!
Well, we'll go right to the antique market and we'll find you another one.
Now, Misty tells me there's a whole booth filled with Franklin Mint stuff.
- But...
- Dottie, you'll lock up, won't you?
- But... But...
- I'll take care of poor Rosemary.
But I heard her voice. It's her!
Mr. Sterner, you've lost a tiny filling.
I have to drill deeply enough to remove all the decay.
All right, go ahead, but be careful. It really hurts.
Open... Wider... Very wide.
Mrs. Sterner, you can't go back there. Mrs. Sterner...
God damn you! You're trying to hurt me on purpose.
Are you okay, Ralph?
Mrs. Sterner, please stay in the waiting room.
Help me, Betty, he's worse than the dentist in The Marathon Man.
I'm sorry to interrupt,
Doctor Sutphin, but there are two police detectives waiting to see you in your office.
Fine.
Good morning. What is it, Officers?
My patient is waiting.
Doctor Sutphin, is your wife a big reader?
Bird books, mostly.
Like these we found in her garbage.
Urge to Kill, Mass
Murder in Houston?
I'm sure those are my son Chip's books.
No, they're your wife's.
We checked.
She bought them at the
Browse and Learn Book Shop, along with a few other titles.
Helter Skelter. Hunting Humans.
MasterCard reference number
7876, dated February 5th.
This is ridiculous!
Doctor Sutphin, is your wife mental?
Damn these gnats. I hate them.
Always something, isn't it?
Can I help you?
Thanks for not buying anything.
Misty, honey. Now lighten up.
It's not the customer's fault that Carl stood you up.
Young man, this Fabergé egg is chipped.
Yes, ma'am, it is.
I'll give you $50.
That's a Franklin Mint piece. $100.
$100? Franklin Mint or not, that's damaged goods.
Hello. This is a very special doll.
This veil is from a gown that came from a bride who was left at the altar.
Only one of its kind.
I'll take this instead.
Oh, that's a nice one, huh?
It'll be cold before you know it.
$3? I guess that's how
I must have marked it.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Did you find your Franklin
Mint egg, Rosemary, darling?
Well, I saw one, but it was really overpriced.
Oh, want me to keep this under the table for you?
If you don't mind. It was on sale.
Oh, Franklin Mint.
Honey, please, for my bedroom shelf.
Okay. Wrap it up for the little lady.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
I'm thirsty.
What do you want?
The Colts.
Banner, please. Thank you.
Honey, I have to take a piss.
There you go.
I can't believe it.
It's fucking Don Knotts.
- He's the coolest. Thanks.
- Bye.
Honey! Look! I made a killing.
Mom, watch the booth.
I want to see what's going on.
Sure.
I hope nothing's wrong.
Beverly, honey, you've got some doo-doo on your shoe.
I hate that.
There was a lady in the men's room, I swear.
A pretty little lady in the stall right next to me.
She must know him.
Carl!
- What happened?
- I don't know...
That's $158.
New York money good enough for you?
Certainly.
Thank you.
Mother! Mother, it's Carl.
He's dead.
How horrible.
Oh, I just sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll.
Mother, didn't you hear me?
Someone murdered Carl in the men's room. I just saw his dead body.
You got your wish, dear.
I didn't wish that.
I didn't want him dead.
Beverly, it's me, Ted Bundy.
It's late at night, six days before my execution and it's lonely here on death row.
Updating the story of the hour, the young man brutally murdered a short time ago in the men's room of the Antique Traders Mart has been identified as 22-year-old
Carl Pageant of Towson.
No, no, no! No!
Chip! Our mother is Charles Manson.
I'm not kidding.
Carl stood me up this morning and then he was murdered at the flea market.
- Murdered?
- Yes, murdered!
You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered, too.
Look, I don't know.
Maybe Mom's nuts.
That's a cool idea, Misty.
Hey, let's make a gore movie about
Mom, better yet, a TV series.
Hey, can I borrow your mother?
My aunt's coming over for dinner and she's always getting on my nerves.
My stepfather's an asshole.
- She could kill him.
- How about Mrs. Ackerman?
We all hate her. Who's gonna be the next victim?
No, stop it! It's not funny.
Mom might do it.
Somebody else might die.
Dinner is served.
Let's say grace and pray for the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days.
Amen to that.
It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?
Bless, O Lord, this food to our use and our self to Thy service.
- Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Hungry, honey?
Dottie Hinkle was right.
It is Beverly Sutphin.
I tell you, I saw blood right there on the bottom of her shoes.
Not exactly blood... it was gore, hanging there like a runny nose.
Nice as pie, she was to me.
And then I hear her say it.
Say what, ma'am?
"Are those..." I can't say the word out loud.
Could you tell a policewoman the exact words she used?
Maybe.
It's okay. Nobody's gonna hurt you.
Come on. Let it out.
"Pussy," that's what she said to me. "Pussy willows."
- You know, Mom...
- Mmm?
Scotty thinks you're the killer.
Does he?
You know, for somebody who doesn't wear his seatbelt, Scotty sure is nosy.
Oh, just a second.
She's gone!
She's gonna kill Scotty!
Get in the car, both of you.
Dad, you don't think she did it, do you?
I do. Mom's gone crazy.
Your mother may have some problems. That's all, Chip.
Come on, hurry.
Detective Gracey and all units.
Suspect's family headed east on Calverton.
Repeat, east on Calverton.
Turn right on Timonium Road, Dad.
- I will, I will.
- Hurry.
Daybreak if you'll only believe
It can be daybreak
Ain't no time to grieve
'Cause it's daybreak
If you'll only believe
And let it shine, shine, shine...
If Mom is psycho, Scotty will still be okay, won't he?
We hope so, Son.
And no matter what your mother is, we'll love her anyway.
This is Scotty's, Dad. His parents aren't home. Come on.
Scotty?
What was that?
I didn't hear anything.
Got any dessert?
Doctor Sutphin said no sweets for you.
Yeah, well, what's he know?
How to send a bill!
I'll get the door.
Suspect's family entering house.
Send backup to 400 Sycamore Street.
I have a feeling old Mom's inside.
Wheel of Fortune!
Ralph, Wheel of Fortune's on!
I'm still eating!
The world's most popular game show...
Come on up, honey, before the kids get home.
May I have a "P"?
Mmm-hmm. A couple of "P's."
Ralph!
What is it, Betty?
I think we've got mice or something.
No, no, no. We paid the exterminator.
Betty?
It's upstairs.
I'm going in. Over.
It's the door on the left.
Break it down, Dad. Break it down!
Scotty, man...
Police! Freeze!
Betty? Betty, answer me!
Ralph...
Help! Help me! Help me, please! Please!
Help me, somebody!
Home, sweet home!
Everything's fine, kids.
I can't believe I thought my own mother was a murderess.
I'm kind of disappointed she isn't.
For a while there it was like being in the movies.
Anybody for dessert?
Mmm. Strawberries.
Let's go.
Dad, you said it would be okay.
Make them go away.
This is embarrassing.
Just pay no attention to the police.
It's all a terrible mistake.
Do you think we'll get on A Current Affair?
Sutphin family proceeding west on Seminary Avenue. Over.
Beverly ain't going nowhere this time.
She's headed for church.
I say we nail her. Over.
Negative.
DA says no bust until lab report is back matching suspect's fingerprints on true crime book with those on scissors and fire poker.
The senseless killing last night of a Towson couple,
Ralph and Betty Sterner, brings to a total of four murders police feel may have been committed by Baltimore's first serial killer.
Information is still sketchy at this point...
Beverly...
Not the Sterners!
Oh, it's a shame, but they should have brushed their teeth, shouldn't they?
This just in.
Police lieutenant Ronald Habbler has publicly named a suspect in the serial killer case, and it's a shocker!
She, that's right, she has been identified as Beverly R. Sutphin of
2815 Calverton Court...
Oh, really...
God. Now I'll never get a boyfriend.
Beverly, I've read all about this. Is it menopause?
Oh, honey...
Tell me the truth, Mom.
Really, it's okay with me.
Are you a serial killer?
Chip, the only cereal I know anything about is Rice Krispies.
Don't worry, honey, we're gonna get you good psychiatric help.
Well, look at that.
And in the house of God.
Who does she think she is?
Gus, Sloppy. Hi.
Hi.
Chip!
Hey, what's up, Birdie?
Can you come...
We said no, remember?
Birdie, please, you can't talk to him. Now, please...
Stay with us, honey.
She's awful! She can't stay here.
Good morning, ladies.
So tell me, Mrs. Sutphin, are you Serial Mom?
- What?
- No comment.
Serial Mom! Wow!
She's headed in, over.
Please stand.
Blessed be God, Father,
Son and Holy Spirit.
And blessed be His kingdom, now and forever.
Amen.
Hallelujah! Christ has risen.
The Lord is risen indeed.
Hallelujah.
Bless the Lord, who forgiveth all our sins...
This is Captain Luecker from Homicide.
Lab reports confirm Sutphin latent print of index finger on true-crime book matches those latent prints lifted from murder weapons.
Bingo, boys! Bust the bitch!
Copy.
Jesus said nothing to condemn capital punishment as he hung on the cross, did he?
No...
If ever there was a time to go on record against the death penalty, wasn't it that night?
Capital punishment is already the law in the state of Maryland.
So what are we waiting for, fellow
Christians? Let's just do it.
Amen!
How you doing?
All standing.
Let us pray and humbly confess our sins unto Almighty God.
Most merciful God, we confess that we have sinned against Thee, by what we have done and by what we have left undone. We are truly sorry and we humbly repent so that we may delight in Thy will and walk in Thy ways to the glory of Thy name.
Amen.
Beverly? Beverly!
Misty? Beverly?
There she is!
Beverly! Misty! Misty...
Misty! Come on...
You guys, come on!
Come on, come on, come on!
Please, Mrs. Sutphin.
Hurry... Get in...
We'll show them, Mom!
We'll go on 60 Minutes!
You know, you're bigger than Freddy and Jason now, only you're a real person!
Do you think I need a lawyer?
You need an agent.
An agent?
Hey! Hey!
- Is your wife a murderess?
- No comment!
Please, my wife is missing.
I'm worried sick about her!
Hey... Hey. Misty.
Just a couple of shots, okay? I'm
Howell Hawkins from the Baltimore Sun.
Hi, Howell.
Misty Sutphin, get in this car!
We're tailing Sutphin husband and daughter but Serial Mom is nowhere in sight.
She got away, boys!
God damn it! Find her!
- In here, Mom.
- But, Chip...
Come on, Mom, I have to open...
Oh, now, this is so silly.
Bye, Mom.
Customers! Get the door.
Good morning, Mrs. Jenson.
Good morning.
Haven't you had enough violence, Chip Sutphin?
Turn that filth off.
Sorry, ma'am.
Do you have the musical, Annie?
Sure do. Did you bring back Ghost Dad?
There you go.
I just love Bill Cosby pictures.
Miss Jenson, I've told you, you have to rewind the tapes before returning them.
Why?
Because it's the rules.
I don't feel like rewinding them.
You see that sign? It's a dollar fine for not rewinding and this time I'm gonna charge you.
$2.99 plus $1 is $3.99.
Keep the change, you son of a psycho!
What a bitch!
It's the influence of all those family films. Right, Mom?
- Hey, Mom!
- Mrs. Sutphin?
Mother? Mother?
Oh, shit!
- You don't think she would...
- She wouldn't...
What's Miss Jenson's address?
Jenkins... Jenson. Emma Lou
Jenson, 19 Clark Avenue.
That's right up the street.
Come on, just in case.
Come on, Birdie, let's go!
What is it, Sylvester? A birdie?
Shh. Mommy's watching Annie.
The sun'll come out
Tomorrow
Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow
Quiet, Sylvester! Nobody's there.
Come on, lick Mommy's feet.
Get them all wet.
And the sorrow
Till there's none
Come on, Birdie. Come on.
Number 19.
That's it. Come on.
Over here! Chip, over here!
Tomorrow
So you gotta hang on
Till tomorrow
Come what may
Come on...
Just thinking about
Tomorrow
Clears away the cobwebs
And the sorrow
Till there's none!
When I'm stuck with a day
That's gray
And lonely
I just stick out my chin
And grin and say
Get up there, get up there.
Is she in there?
Oh!
The sun'll come out
Tomorrow
So you gotta hang on
Till tomorrow
Come what may
Tomorrow!
Tomorrow!
I love you, tomorrow!
She's singing Annie.
The sun'll come out
Tomorrow
So you gotta hang on
Till tomorrow
Come what may
Tomorrow!
Tomorrow!
I love you, tomorrow!
You're only a day away
Rewind!
Oh, my God! No!
I saw blood, and it's brown!
It's not red like in the horror movies, but brown!
- Is Mom in there?
- No!
It wasn't like the gore movies at all! It was real.
Come on! Birdie, let's cut through here!
Wear your seatbelt! It's the law!
- Out, please.
- What the fuck?
Yes, ma'am.
Dear God, I promise I'll never watch another sex film again!
I promise! I promise!
It's okay.
Dad! Dad...
Have you seen Mom?
No, have you?
Scotty?
Oh, my God!
Get in!
All units, Serial Mom is headed south on Keswick.
Proceed with caution. She is armed and fucking nuts!
Oh, shit!
Mike! Mike! Let me in, okay?
Hey! ID.
Can I give it to you inside?
Hey, buddy, nobody gets in without ID.
Birth date?
December 14, 1972.
Please!
Okay, go ahead.
I won't flinch and I won't break a sweat
When I taste the cyanide gas
Gas, gas
Only way you're gonna shut me up
Only way you're gonna shut me up
- Hey!
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
- Hey, look, it's her.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Who?
It's the murder lady, the one on TV.
- Excuse me.
- Cool. Is she in a band?
Watch me wither through the glass
Smiling as I sip the last gas
Justifiable homicide
Almond blossom-scented cyanide
Gas chamber
The police are after me.
I beg your pardon.
Hey, hey, hey. hey!
Hey... You're Serial Mom.
Yes, I guess I am.
Well, come on in, lady. Quick!
You'll keep me down
Only way you think you'll keep me down
Coming through. Thank you.
Help. Help!
Excuse me, please.
I think maybe you better lock the car.
- Can't stop now.
- Is my mom in there?
Dad, now, look cool.
It's Hammerjacks.
Excuse me.
Kids! Put me down! Put me down!
Your God says thou shalt not kill
But here you are dropping the pill
Legal system, what a sham
Put me down!
Flying colors on the final exam
Gas chamber
Gas chamber
Only way you're gonna shut me up
Only way you're gonna shut me up
Buckle up, Scotty!
Oh! Mrs. Sutphin! No! I'll wear my seatbelt, Mrs. Sutphin.
Holy fucking shit!
Hi!
Move it! You're under arrest!
- Honey?
- Shut up.
Serial Mom! Serial Mom!
Serial Mom! Serial Mom! Serial
Mom! Serial Mom! Serial Mom!
Serial Mom! Serial Mom! Serial Mom!
Serial Mom! Serial Mom! Serial Mom!
- Can she get a fair jury?
- Misty! Look this way!
Please just let us through.
- your wife's innocence, Mr. Sutphin?
- Please!
How does it feel to have a killer mom?
Mr. Sutphin, how does your wife feel?
Beverly is devastated by the charges against her.
Just now I found a peanut
Found a peanut, right now
Cracked it open, cracked it open
Cracked it open just now...
Didn't I see you at Hinckley?
- I was there.
- I thought so.
My husband thought I was crazy.
She is.
Today we're covering day one of the trial of Serial Mom...
Look! Here they come!
Stop the violence? What is this?
Who are you working for?
What do you think her chances are?
Excuse me! Mr. Sutphin!
Coming through.
Quiet in the courtroom.
This court is now in session.
Oh, hello, jury people.
I'm Beverly Sutphin.
Oh, I like your jacket.
Mrs. Sutphin, I said quiet.
Honey, hi! Oh, kids, are you doing your homework?
You are accused of multiple murders.
This is a court of law, not a coffee klatch.
Mr. Nazlerod, your opening statement.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen of the jury.
My name is Timothy Nazlerod and I hope we can be friends.
I have to tell you at the outset, however, that this is not a pretty case.
This defendant, Beverly Sutphin, is a woman evil to the core, a rotten apple, if you will, who beyond any reasonable doubt killed six innocent people.
That's right, she murdered them.
- Well, they sort of deserved it.
- Shh.
Evilly and with full premeditation, with a speeding car, a fire poker, a pair of scissors, a toppled air conditioner, the lethal flames from an aerosol can and yes, even a leg of lamb.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this defendant, this Beverly Sutphin, she is not a woman.
She is a monster!
Defense attorney, your opening statement for the jury?
And let's not take all day, either.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Herbie Hebden and you and I have a tough job ahead of us.
I've known the Sutphin family for 16 years.
Dad, Eugene, is my dentist.
Chip and Misty played with my own children.
But I found out that I don't know Beverly Sutphin at all.
Psst.
No one really knows Beverly
Sutphin. You see...
Psst.
Beverly Sutphin is insane.
Yes, she committed these terrible crimes, but that doesn't make her a bad person.
Your Honor, I would like to make a motion.
I wish to fire my attorney and defend myself.
Beverly Sutphin is not guilty by reason of insanity.
Your Honor, I have the right to defend myself. I've read the law books.
Ware v. State, 1964 and
Schuette v. State, 1962.
Mrs. Sutphin, the defendant who has herself for a lawyer has a fool for a client.
Counsel, approach the bench.
I don't think this is a good idea.
Oh, yeah. Oh, no. It's okay.
That's my ruling.
Thank you very much.
Mrs. Sutphin, I have no legal choice but to let you take over as your own attorney.
How do you plead?
Not guilty, Your Honor.
Order! Order in the courtroom.
Quiet down or I'll clear this room out!
I call to the stand Dottie Hinkle.
Raise your right hand, please.
Do you hereby solemnly swear or affirm under the penalties of perjury that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth,
- the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
- I do.
Thank you.
Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever receive any obscene telephone calls?
I certainly did.
And did you recognize the voice of the caller?
Not at first.
But then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering.
And I put two and two together.
Whose voice was it, Dottie?
It was her, Beverly Sutphin, sitting right there.
I'm lucky I'm not dead.
Mrs. Hinkle, do you drink?
No, I don't.
So you were not drunk when you received those allegedly obscene phone calls?
I certainly was not.
Now, you mean to tell me that the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's, the day you claim you recognized my voice, you were not drinking?
One beer with lunch is hardly drinking.
So you do drink?
Socially. I'll have a beer.
So you admit you just lied.
No, I don't, you bitch!
Watch your mouth, Mrs. Hinkle.
Did you see that? She just said, "Fuck you" to me!
Let the record show I am merely standing here.
Fuck you, too, you whore.
I'm warning you, Mrs. Hinkle.
One more obscenity and I'm gonna charge you with contempt of court.
Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?
No, I'm not, you motherfucker!
Mrs. Hinkle, I find you guilty of contempt and I sentence you to a $1,000 fine and five days in jail!
- Cocksucker!
- Lock her up!
You lousy pig fucker! You bitch!
You ugly whore! Let go!
Come on, they're going quickly!
"Serial Mom" t-shirts.
Get them here.
$12, while they last, plus tax.
- MasterCard and Visa.
- I'll take two.
All right, ma'am.
I wish they'd had something like this at the Kennedy kid trial.
Sign right here. Signature and home phone.
You've read about it in the paper!
Serial Mom. She's Beverly
Sutphin and she's my mom!
Listen, you tell Geraldo to go to hell, okay?
I don't care what Jeffrey MacDonald's people got. He's old news.
We fly first class or we don't do the show. It's that simple.
Are you Chip Sutphin?
Hold on a sec.
Yeah, I am, but you're gonna have to speak with my agent.
Your mom killed my brother. Come on!
Come on...
God... Jeez, man!
It's cool. It's cool, all right?
You're Carl's brother, right?
That's right.
I'm sorry he's dead.
But have you signed off yet?
You mean for TV or print?
TV, man. Suzanne Somers is interested in playing my mom.
Suzanne Somers?
Who's gonna play my brother?
I wonder if Jason
Priestley's available?
Miss Hodges, could you describe the car?
The one you saw run over
Mr. Stubbins in cold blood.
I seen that movie. It was on cable.
Miss Hodges... Please, Miss Hodges.
Could you... Could you describe...
Miss Hodges.
Excuse me.
Look, man, like I told you, it was blue.
The car, not the driver.
Look, it was just blue.
You know, like, blue.
There you go. Enjoy my book.
Could you sign it "To
A Future Serial Mom"?
Sure. You think she did it?
I have reasonable doubt.
I feel like killing a couple people myself.
Eight dollars, ma'am.
And these books, these disgusting books that so lovingly describe the sadistic acts of serial killers, where did you find these books, Detective?
In Beverly Sutphin's trashcan.
You may cross-examine,
Mrs. Sutphin.
Thank you.
Detective Gracey, if I were to look through your trash, what reading materials would I find?
Objection! Immaterial!
You may answer.
Time, Sports Illustrated,
National Geographic.
My wife gets Ladies' Home Journal.
Yet, last night, we found in your trashcan this magazine,
Chicks with Dicks.
God damn you. That's trespassing!
Never judge a person by what they read, Detective.
Your witness, Mr. Nazlerod.
I am a married man. I hope they give you the gas chamber!
The jury is instructed to ignore the outburst of the witness.
I call to the stand
Rosemary Ackerman.
Now, did you ever see the fire poker again after you left it with Mrs. Sutphin?
Yes, thirty minutes later. It was covered with blood and gore and Carl Pageant was dead.
No further questions.
Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the Antique Mart, where did you go?
Browsing.
Did Carl Pageant buy something you wanted?
I didn't want that Fabergé egg.
It was chipped.
Carl Pageant died because of you, didn't he?
No. I would never hurt anybody.
It was your Premiere magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?
Yes, but I lent it...
And they were your scissors that were found in Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
Yes. But I didn't...
Mrs. Ackerman...
Do you recycle?
No.
I don't have room in my kitchen.
Detective Pike, did you then proceed to the stage area inside Hammerjacks?
Yes, I did. Scotty
Barnhill was on fire and he fell to his knees in flames.
Would this be what you saw?
Yes, sir. A real barbecue.
May I show this photo to the jury, Your Honor?
Chip, she's here.
They're entitled to see
Mrs. Sutphin's handiwork.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Your Honor, may the photograph please be received into evidence and shown to the jury?
Oh, yeah. Yes, yes.
Jeez, that really is Suzanne Somers.
Oh, I loved you in Three's Company.
No further questions.
I call to the stand Marvin Pickles.
Mr. Pickles! Mr. Marvin Pickles!
Be right out.
The judge is waiting for you.
Okay.
Come on, get moving.
State your name, please.
Marvin A. Pickles.
Mr. Pickles, were you in the men's room at the Antique Trade Mart on Saturday, May 15?
Yes, I was.
Oh, hi. What was the rating?
Well, what was the share?
Did you see anyone in the booth next to you?
Excuse me, I...
Mr. Pickles, did you see anyone in the booth next to you?
I'm not sure... I...
What do you mean you're not sure?
There was nobody next to me.
Mr. Pickles, didn't you tell the Grand Jury that you looked down and you saw a pair of ladies' shoes in the booth next to you?
I just said what you told me to.
Perjury is a serious offense, Mr. Pickles.
I... I made it all up! I've never seen Beverly Sutphin in my life!
You'll pay for this,
Marvin Pickles.
I'm turning your file over to the vice squad.
The prosecution rests.
The prosecution has proven nothing, Your Honor.
The defense rests also!
Order. Order in the courtroom.
We'll take a 10-minute recess.
Attorneys, be ready with your closing arguments.
Well, I feel that Beverly Sutphin is an innocent woman, wrongly accused.
A normal housewife trapped in a nightmare of circumstantial evidence.
There she is, Henrietta Lee
Lucas, Joan Wayne Gacy.
A new face in the deck of serial killer trading cards.
Find her guilty on all six counts of first-degree murder.
I only hope I can portray Serial
Mom's life on the TV screen with the proper dignity that this feminist heroine deserves.
Look at me. I am as normal as all of you.
But I have been framed by the police and perjured against by the very people I thought were my friends.
- All I ask of you...
- Stop that!
Is that you have the courage to find me innocent of these terribly untrue charges.
All I ask is that you find me innocent of these terribly untrue charges.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?
Yes, we have, Your Honor.
We find the defendant not guilty of all charges.
Way to go, Beverly!
Oh! I'm coming home!
What should I do?
I don't know. Bring her home, I guess.
No more violence. No more violence.
You think she'll like me?
Just be nice to her and try...
Try not to get on her nerves.
She got off.
She's innocent!
Congratulations, Beverly.
Will you be staying...
- Hello, Baltimore!
- I love you.
Oh, I love you, too.
Thank you all for coming. Hi, there, LA. Hello, Cleveland.
Hey, Serial Mom!
Well, hello, New York!
Beverly, who does your hair?
Excuse me!
Would you hold these for me, honey?
Excuse me.
Excuse me, Mr. Sutphin, can I ask you a question, please?
Did the system work?
Do you think it worked?
Excuse me. The rights have been sold.
We did it. We set her free!
I knew she was innocent right from the beginning.
You can't wear white shoes after Labor Day.
That's not true anymore.
Yes, it is. Didn't your mother ever tell you?
Now you know.
No, please. Fashion has changed.
No, it hasn't.
Are you surprised, Mr. Sutphin?
No comment. Beverly?
Here I am, honey.
Beverly, hi! I'm Suzanne Somers.
Hello!
Mrs. Sutphin, can we get a shot of you and Suzanne Somers?
Absolutely, stand here, Beverly.
Guys, what about a nice two-shot, okay?
No, Suzanne, really, I'd be much...
Beverly, Beverly, stand right here!
Okay, smile, Serial Mom!
Suzanne Somers, this is my bad side!
What is your deal?
I got a big game on Friday.
Look, it's no good. I need my fluids.
Your fluids?
Yeah.
Mary Jo, I'm curious.
Why would you do something like that?
Why not?
It's self-mutilation, really.
Self-mutilate this, fluid boy.
Good find, girl.
Yeah.
Who's that?
Oh, shit. No.
Slut.
Andy.
You want to step out for a minute?
You kids shouldn't be out past curfew.
Andy Effkin, toast with the most.
You like our chances against Knight's Ridge?
We should do fine.
Thrown for a loss.
Is your arm okay for the game?
- It's good.
- Offensive line up to par?
Son of a bitch.
Fuck.
Easy, Eff. Easy, buddy.
- I need my fluids.
- Give me the gun.
Get out of here, now.
What?
You gotta be shittin' me.
That's Mary Jo.
Clarice, it's Cox.
We got a wet one here on the bluff.
I just can't wait, Steve.
To do what?
To see my new room, my new school, my new everything.
Yeah, new everything.
It's gonna be awesome.
It's gonna be better.
Way better.
Come on.
Looks like you're moving to Cradle Bay.
- We sure are.
- Sure you'll like it here.
- You'll never want to leave.
- You hear that?
Hey, you. I thought you were gonna help me.
Come on.
Fridge.
Thank you.
You all right?
Yeah.
Just trying to put some of this stuff away.
Nervous?
- About what?
- First day at school.
Dad?
What are you doing, dipshit?
Don't worry about snakes in the garden... when you got spiders in your bed.
"They had been so innocent and little there.
And all beyond was so unknown and great."
Very good, Trent.
To wit, when Pip says this...
Dickens is speaking of the joy of discovery... of newness, of change.
Mr. Clark, perhaps you can relate.
Mr. Clark is new to us from Chicago.
Do they read Dickens in Chicago?
Dickie Atkinson.
Welcome.
Tell us why you're late.
Trouble with the camshaft?
Like you know what one is.
Somebody woke up on the wrong side of the carburetor this morning.
Peckerhead.
What is... if I may display my ignorance... a peckerhead?
Why are you laughing, Whalen?
Nothing, Richard.
I was just thinking how ignorance kills.
- What does that mean?
- Exactly.
You ass-kissing little fuck!
Boys!
Perhaps yet another little sojourn to the principal will serve you well?
Want to know what a peckerhead is?
- That's a peckerhead.
- Thank you for the clarification.
Please send Principal Weathers our hosannas!

Welcome to my nightmare.
- Why can't we help you with your math?
- Just leave me alone.
Hello.
Phlegm.
P-H-L-E-M-G-H. Phlegm.
- Wrong.
- Let me see that.
- What are you two doing?
- We're having a spelling bee.
My brother Allen was the best speller.
- I thought your name was Steve.
- It is.
Allen's my brother who died.
I have a grandfather who died.
Why don't we change the subject?
- Pass your plate.
- Why?
- You know why.
- Nathan.
Shannon, do you get yelled at if you talk about your dead grandfather?
Around here people go crazy if you talk about a dead brother.
Hello?
I'm here for the Mustang parts.
What the fuck?
What are you doing here?
The troops shall set you free.
What do you guys want?
Sweet Dickie, we want you.
We've got it for you, Richard.
We've got all the winning numbers.
We like to welcome all new students.
Standard procedure.
As soon as Dr. Caldicott arrives, we can begin.
Doctor?
He's the resident faculty fellow, an outstanding educator.
He's been with us two years now.
Works with the students in a counseling capacity.
I think you'll like him.
I'm sorry I'm late. Hi. Edgar Caldicott.
It's nice to finally meet you.
- Everything okay?
- Fine.
Have you given any thought to extracurricular activities or sports?
Not really.
- There's the Blue Ribbons.
- The Blue Ribbons?
Yeah. They help each other study and practice.
It's a team effort.
It's a motivational workshop, really.
The Blue Ribboners have truly been making the grade... and doing wonderful things on the playing field.
All of us here are aware of the tragedy back in Chicago.
- If there's anything we can do...
- I said everything's fine.
Steven, we know how tough it can be.
Whether or not you want to be involved with the school... we want to be involved with you.
- That's all the meeting is about.
- Okay.
So go make some new friends.
- Like that?
- What is it?
It's bona fide jitterbug.
It's my buddy, Rachel. Cook's Ridge trash.
She's a great chick, but she's Cook's Ridge trash.
Come on.
Dancing queen.
Rachel, this is Stevie Boy.
Good man.
This is Rachel. Cook's ridge trash.
Bite me.
Wow, appropriate sparks are flying.
Somebody cue the power ballad.
Fail to be a tumor, Gavin.
What do you say we cruise town, chase a case... hit the bluff and drink some beer?
Consecrate Stevie Boy's arrival to this new and pathetic tank town.
- You down?
- Sounds razor.
Stevie Boy?
Sure.
Excuse me, sir. Can you help me out?
- What?
- I'm trying to buy some beer.
I have the money and everything,
I'm just a month from...
Get off my case, kid.
You know, the problem with America... is mankind's abject unwillingness... to contribute to the delinquency of minors.
That was like the tenth guy.
- Chug.
- What are you doing?
- Chasing. Nobody's willing.
- Yeah?
Hello, Charles.
Cycle any anabolic goodies lately?
- You're funny, Strick.
- Thanks. I'm here all week.
A couple of us are going to the Yogurt
Shoppe later, if you want to come by.
The Yogurt Shoppe? Yeah.
You want to make an "active culture" joke here or should I handle this one?
- See you later.
- Bye.
- What?
- What?
You're actually flattered that barn door has a thing for you?
- Bullshit.
- Right.
There's for the syrup.
Is that the right one for the orange juice?
Where's the deodorant coupon?
It's here somewhere.
- What does a hooker say after 12 hours?
- What?
Clean up on aisle four.
Sorry.
Come here!
Easy.
Fuck! You Blue Ribbon shithead!
What was that all about?
Toxic Jock Syndrome.
- You'll be fine.
- Where's my shake?
What the hell would make a kid freak out like that?
It has to be steroids.
All those jocks are into it.
Kelly Connor saw Andy Effkin bite the head off a kitten in a fit of rage.
- No way.
- I'm serious.
I think it's bullshit, though.
It is not bullshit, and it's not steroids.
- Here we go.
- What?
Gavin thinks some sinister force is taking over the Cradle Bay meatheads.
- You know what it is.
- A sinister force?
You know, evil.
Nowhere to turn, no one to trust.
- Fail to be a bitch.
- Fail to be a pucker-ass.
- What?
- Nothing.
Let's go!
Andy killed her.
Everyone's saying she ran away.
I saw her dead body, but I can't prove it.
- Those fuckers.
- Why didn't you go to the police?
Cox was there, man.
The cop didn't do shit.
Fuck, nobody listens to me.
Cancer Corner.
Best place in the school to sneak a smoke.
What are you shitbirds doing down here?
- Relax, Mr. Newberry.
- You ain't supposed to be down here!
This is my friend, Steve.
He's new to the Bay.
Gnaw, gnaw, gnaw.
Drag marks.
Drag marks of a rat's tail.
What have you got there?
It's an "E-rat-icator."
Sounds are supposed to scare the rats away.
- You hear that?
- Yeah.
Scary, ain't it?
Piece of crap. Doesn't work worth spit!
A dollar for everything that didn't work worth spit.
Mr. Newberry has the Boo-Radley- village-idiot-Quasimodo thing going.
- Don't you?
- What?
And he's currently involved... in a war against the rodent population of Cradle Bay.
Gotta fight them!
Rats from the bay.
Incoming! You think you can run, but you can't hide!
- A day at the master races.
- Check that out.
Jesus.
Is that Dickie? What is he doing?
He's one of them now, bud.
He's a Blue Robot.
Watch and learn.
What the fuck?
They're peckerheads. Look at him.
He's killing his hard-on.
Fore!
Maybe he turned over a new leaf.
I would like to own the new leaf concession here in Cradle Bay.
Did you tell Steve about the murders?
Steve is a disbeliever.
The mysterious disappearance of Mary Jo
Copeland and Officer Kramer? Uh-huh.
This is where he accuses me of being paranoid.
"Denial" ain't just a river in Italy, bud.
Check your weed, boys.
- You are beige, boy.
- See you, Rachel.
Bye.
Here's your chocolate sundae.
Hope you guys...
Can I help you?
Steven, good to see you, brother.
Come sit down.
Steven, this is Kathy, Andy...
- Tom, Randi...
- Hi.
Lorna, Chug.
You know Robby and Dickie.
This is Steven. Sit down.
Steven's new to the Bay from Chicago.
- Do you like it here?
- Yeah, it's okay.
You had friends in Chicago?
Yeah.
You can have friends here.
Didn't you guys get in a fight in English?
We've made peace.
That's what separates us from the animals.
Dirtbag alert.
- I gotta talk to you.
- Easy, slick. Steven's relaxing.
The Yogurt Shoppe.
What the fuck is a "shoppy"?
Why don't you make like a tree and leave?
Clever girl. Come on, Steve.
We get in one argument, and you go bond with these guys?
What happened to you?
Did you eat too much flank steak?
- Let's go.
- You don't have to go, brother.
I'm not your brother.
You wanted to tell me something?
Here I am. What?
- They're hypnotized.
- What?
Maybe not hypnotized, but brainwashed, lobotomized, programmed.
Want proof? Here. Here's proof.
Look. That's Robby, Randi, Trent.
They used to be my friends.
Maybe they got sick of your rap.
I can relate.
I thought you'd say that. That is the purpose of tonight's excursion.
After tonight, you'll strap on a hog and be a man.
It's something that benefits everybody.
The Thespian Society, for example...
Blue Ribbon meeting. Every Monday.
This is where the shit goes down. Listen.
By conducting the bake sale in conjunction with the pep rally... we can be selling cakes and cookies when school spirit is at its optimum.
I had no idea the evil was this pervasive.
Jan, what's on your mind?
This may sound strange, but... although we couldn't be more pleased with Andrew's improved studies... he's become somewhat different... since returning from your weekend enlightenment seminar.
Different how?
He seems unkind to almost everyone outside of the club.
I can understand your concern.
Let me address it.
Kids being kids have a tendency to overreact.
We've found they go through a brief period... of being, shall we say, snobby.
But what it really is is a feeling that's new to them.
The feeling is pride.
They're improved.
When you soar with the eagles, the pigeons below look pedestrian.
- Give it a little time.
- Dork.
Now, a new candidate has been nominated.
His parents have been counseled and consented.
Colleen, if you will.
- Male, 17 years old...
- Superstar.
Suspended four times last school year.
Parents feel candidate is depressed... spending too much time listening to rock music and masturbating.
- Candidate has a history of truancy...
- Poor son of a bitch.
And a general lack of direction.
Candidate is C-minus student, yet has A-plus potential.
All in favor?
Great. February candidate confirmed.
- Training to begin ASAP.
- Shit.
- What?
- Join me in welcoming to our circle...
Ernest and Lucille Strick... the parents of our next superstar,
Gavin Strick.
They want you to join their club.
Shine them on and blow them off.
- What are they gonna do?
- You still don't get it.
You still think this is about blood drives and bake sales.
Wait a second.
Maybe you should lay off that shit.
Maybe you should eat me.
Yeah.
This is huge.
Why don't you see this is fucking huge?
Don't fucking "Gavin" me. I'm a dead man.
My parents sold me out.
You saw it. You were there.
Why don't you see this?
Stay at my house tonight.
I have to go home.
When I get there and they're waiting for me, I'll smoke them all. You hear me?
Everyone who's at my house:
Robby, Whalen, Caldicott, even my olds.
- Give me the gun.
- No fucking way.
- Let me have it!
- No! You're losing it!
You'll wind up shooting the paperboy.
- Just go home.
- Give me my fucking gun.
Good night.
Don't leave me alone like this!
Stevie Boy?
I would have smoked them all. Fuck, man.
Wait a minute.
- What is this?
- I don't believe...
Show time.
Who put the acid in my Spam?
- Hello.
- What is up with this?
I just want to apply myself.
I think I'll get better results on this side of the caf.
Beat it, honey. This is rarefied turf.
Sluts need not apply.
Later.
How much do I owe you?
- Treat yourself.
- Indeed.
- Where you going?
- I'm going to talk to Gavin.
You're not wanted, Steven.
Just leave him be.
Get the fuck off me.
Guys, come on.
What's your maladjustment?
You okay?
Forget it! Stop it!
That's enough!
What happened to you?
We shall overcome, Steven.
- You okay?
- Man, fantastic.
You'll see.
Retard.
Are you okay?
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here.
- I hate the caf.
- Everybody hates the caf.
They hate the ketchup.
I got...
That's not good.
Doesn't even look like ketchup.
"Slaughterhouse-Five"?
What? Give me that!
What the hell's the matter with you?
You rats from the Bay. You rats!
Rats everywhere.
You kids think you know everything!
You don't know nothing!
Forget the rats. It's all an act.
- You don't know.
- It's all bullshit.
Get away from me!
Brother!
Wait.
Do you like Kurt Vonnegut?
I don't get it.
Didn't you ever want to just disappear, lunch boy?
Poof, you're gone.
You'd be surprised how interesting people become... when they think you are really stupid.
- Who is it?
- Calm down, Steven.
Where you going, Steven?
- There's nothing to be afraid of.
- Here is the light, Steven.
Hello, Steven.
What are you doing here?
- I'm tutoring Lindsay in Algebra.
- Where is she?
- Where's my sister?
- She's upstairs sleeping.
- Where are my parents?
- At a meeting.
- What meeting?
- Steven, you're hurt.
- I'll live.
- Let me put something on that.
It's fine.
Maybe you should go.
I mean it.
- If that's what you want.
- Yeah.
Can I go to the bathroom first?
Sure. It's around the corner.
I know where it is.
Of course you do. Everyone knows where everything is around here.
Your sister's a great kid.
She's very special.
Hello, Steven.
- What are you doing?
- I'm not sure really.
Go home, Lorna.
You don't find me slightly attractive?
I find you very attractive.
It's just that you're a Blue Ribbon and I'm not.
So...
Wait a second.
I'm not supposed to be doing this.
It's bad, wrong. Wrong, bad.
It's not bad. It's... Jesus Christ.
I have to go home.
I have a big physics test tomorrow.
After extracting the implant...
I tested its integrity to the optic nerve, and it was intact.
The chip is functioning properly.
But I did find that excess stimulation to the pineal gland... caused the dopamine levels to go through the roof.
Every time one of these kids gets a hard-on, they beat somebody with it.
We could do a cingulotomy.
No. Cut a craniotomy flap.
I'll get elbow deep, see what happens.
- What?
- Cut the bruises out of the banana.
What about her parents?
Tell them she'll be missing cheerleading practice this week.
Look. Cook's Ridge trash.
Once you've all settled in,
I'm sure she'll fit in just fine.
- Thanks, Dr. Caldicott.
- Did you hear that, Nancy?
Yeah, Mom.
Come on, let's go. I gotta sell this bud.
I got two customers left.
If this keeps up,
I'll be the 7-Eleven guy.
I'm gonna grab a smoke.
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
I saw you come down here, Rachel.
I just want to ask you something.
What do you want?
I just want to know...
It's me asking, not my friends.
Will you go out with me?
You're kidding, right?
Will you, please?
No, Chug, I won't.
Why not?
How about this?
You couldn't repulse me more if you were made out of shit and maggots!
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- You want to be that way?
- Stop it. I'll scream. I swear to God.
- Yeah?
- Yeah!
What will happen if you do?
I'm a Blue Ribbon, baby. Team captain.
You're just a trashy, tattooed love doll.
Come on, Rae-Rae, give up the plate for Chug. Come on!
Fuck!
Stop it!
What you looking at, retard?
Wow.
I guess I just think you should try and fit in.
We're gonna be here for a long time.
You, me, Mom and Dad.
And Chip and Dale.
- What is this?
- What?
- Where did you get this?
- I got it at school.
They were handing them out.
We all got one.
- Go inside.
- Why?
- I said go inside!
- Spaz.
- We should talk.
- Yeah.
There's something you need to see.
Rae, Gavin Strick here.
Live and unplugged.
Guess if you found this, then you know.
Am I hanging with Trent and Robby... and the rest of the Robots?
God, I hope not.
I hit the vents tonight when I split up with Stevie Boy.
He doesn't believe.
I went back to school... and I overheard Caldicott talking to some wonk.
Mentioned "Bishop Flats Eleven."
Caldicott called them his children.
Then he freaked out on the guy and kicked him out of his office.
So, I figure something's up with that.
Keep an eye on U.V. For me, though I doubt they'll want him.
I doubt they're interested in the pigmentally challenged.
That's not their style.
I have to go get paranoid.
This is Gavin Strick... reporting live from The Reconstruction.
I pulled this off the AMA database.
Caldicott's last place of employment... was across the bay in Bishop Flats... at the Bellknop Psychiatric Facility.
He spent seven years doing neuropharmacology.
Mind control.
Next ferry's at 6:00.
- Bishop Flats?
- You down for it?
Razor.
Let's go.
- I miss Gavin. He's almost like a...
- A brother?
Yeah, exactly.
I had a brother.
Sorry.
His name was Allen.
He was a couple years older than me.
If he had made it through his teens, he would have been amazing.
But he was always in pain.
And eight months to the day he shot himself...
Dad said we were moving to Cradle Bay... where everything was gonna be all right.
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't.
Let's go.
Maybe this isn't a good idea.
Think of it as our first date.
That's why my toothes are clean.
Be pretty... and do it just right.
Children.
Meet the musical little creatures... that hide among the flowers.
Shut up.
Let's get out of here.
It's Caldicott's daughter.
His own daughter.
How can nobody not know there's something fucked up in Bishop Flat?
Shit, his own daughter was in there.
Nobody's safe.
The last ferry leaves at 11:30.
Tell me you have a razor plan.
- I am making this shit up as I go.
- Great.
Shit.
Hi, Officer Cox.
Closing time, Frankie.
Yeah, it's getting late.
Just be cool.
It's past curfew.
She's driving me home.
- From?
- Studying.
Where are your books?
- Evening, Officer.
- What are you doing?
I'm getting rid of rats.
The pink-eyed vermin can't see for spit.
Quarter a rat.
Town council gives me a quarter a rat.
I'm going to be rich at this rate.
I'll be on...
- "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous."
- Moron.
- Where are you going?
- Can we go now?
Step out of the truck, now.
- What are you doing?
- Hey!
Let her go! What do you want from us?
Get in here.
That's a big rat.
Come on, get out of there!
What are you waiting for? Get!
Let's get out of here.
Come on, Steve.
You have to trust me for now.
Do you trust me?
Where are you going?
I'm taking Lindsay away from here.
We're going back to Chicago.
- Don't do this. You're scaring me.
- I'm scared too, Mom, believe me.
Stevie, you have to know we're here for you no matter what.
- God, do you really mean that?
- Of course we do.
- Then let's all go home.
- Steven, you are home.
Cradle Bay is where you belong.
Here with your family.
You signed me up for the program?
- We want what's best for you.
- What about what I want?
Look, Steven, do you really like the way you feel?
Shut the fuck up!
You sold me out.
- We didn't. We just want you back.
- Steven, please...
My name is Steve, okay?
Nobody calls me Steven except for them.
Fine. Come on, Linds.
May I have this dance?
Where's Rachel?
She's gone to an institute of higher learning, Steven.
- Help!
- Everything's under control.
Who's your daddy?
Respect yourself, Steven.
Ice, ice, baby.
It's not what you think.
It's a new kind of cool.
You feel better, freer.
I've never felt so alive in my life.
- It's humanity's sacred essence.
- A new and finer age.
Go forward.
Be the ball.
People will know when I get out of here.
That's right, they will know.
They'll know because you'll be better.
Adolescence is a minefield.
But soon, you'll be fully equipped to walk right through it.
Yeah, straight A's and a letter jacket.
And every now and then, you rape and kill.
To cure cancer, you gotta kill a few white mice.
Meet the musical little creatures... that hide among the flowers.
That's a battle I didn't win.
You'll be different.
I know so much more now.
She wasn't that bright to begin with.
Be all that's good.
Stop fooling around.
Let the light in.
Be excellent.
You're number one. You're an ace.
Achieve.
You'll be okay.
Going somewhere with my custard, Steven?
Let's go, Chug.
That's my girl you got there.
I can't let you take her.
Come on! Get up!
Come on, Rae-Rae, give up the plate for old Chug.
Come on.
- Not so fast.
- What?
What's the capital of North Dakota?
How the fuck should I know?
Okay, you're cool. Get in.
We gotta book.
Early bird ferry's in 20 minutes.
Shit, man.
It's time to leave mediocrity behind.
Step up on the bus.
What is it?
Come and get it, you blue bastards!
What is going on?
Come on.
Get them to the ferry.
I'll meet you down there.
Don't leave without me.
- Lunch boy.
- What are you doing?
We can't very well have these shitbirds... graduating and going off into the world.
Maybe they can be helped.
No, they can't. And neither can I.
Do good things, lunch boy.
Hey, teacher!
Leave those kids alone!
It's over, you son of a bitch.
It's finished.
"Finished"?
There will always be other towns... and other troubled teens... and other worried parents.
Science is God.
Be the ball.
- What happened?
- We're the only ones left.
So, what do we do now?
We go home.
And where's that?
Wherever.
Wherever we are.
Appropriate sparks are flying.
Somebody cue up the power ballad, man.
All right now, settle down.
Turn that damn thing off.
Now, y'all got a new student teacher starting today.
I want you to show him a little bit more respect than the last one.
Speak of the devil.
Say hello to your new student teacher, class.
They're all yours.
Peckerhead.
Hello, class. Welcome.
Be excellent.
Yes. Wonderful.
Meet the musical little creatures... that hide in the flowers.
Treat yourself.
Subtitles By Captions, Inc. Los Angeles
I remember the first war.
The way the sky burned.
The faces of angels destroyed.
I saw a third of
Heaven's legion banished... and the creation of Hell.
I stood with my brothers and watched Lucifer fall.
But now my brothers are not brothers.
And we have come here, where we are mortal, to steal a dark soul not yet Lucifer's... to serve our cause.
I have always obeyed.
But I never thought the war... would happen again.
Come to our help,
Lord, Holy Father, almighty and eternal God.
You are the source of every honor and dignity, of all progress and stability.
You watch over the growing family of man by Your gift of wisdom... and Your pattern of order.
When You had appointed high priests to rule Your people,
You chose other men next to them in rank and dignity... to be with them and to help them in their task.
And so there grew up the ranks of priests... and the offices of Levites established by sacred rites.
In the desert You extended the spirit of Moses to 70 wise men... who helped him to rule the great company of his people.
He shared among the sons of Aaron the fullness of their father's power, to provide worthy priests in sufficient number... for the increasing rites of sacrifice and worship.
With the same loving care You gave companions to Your Son's apostles... to help in teaching the faith, they preached the Gospel to the whole world.
Let Joseph, who is to be ordained priest, come forward.
Lord, I am not worthy to receive You, but say the word and I shall be healed.
Almighty Father, grant to this servant of Yours the dignity of the priesthood.
Renew within him the spirit of holiness... as a coworker with the Order of Bishops.
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ.
One God, forever and ever.
Amen.
Let Thomas, who is to be ordained priest, come forward.
Some people lose their faith because Heaven shows them too little.
But how many people lose their faith because Heaven shows them too much?
Years later, of all the gospels
I learned in seminary school, a verse from St. Paul stays with me.
It is perhaps the strangest passage in the Bible, in which he writes:
"Even now in Heaven there were angels carrying savage weapons."
Hey, you're not supposed to be up here.
Sorry.
Don't fuckin' move.
You don't need a gun,
Thomas.
Who are you?
Everything used to be much simpler, didn't it?
Get down, slow.
- Everyone thinks they know what Heaven is like.
- Turn around. Turn around!
- Heaven isn't Heaven anymore.
- Now, take it easy.
- Calm down. Take it easy.
- Thomas... Thomas!
Will you listen?
I was in the church that day.
I know what you saw.
I know why you left your faith on that floor.
What do you want?
You have no idea what this is like for me.
"A Thesis on Angels in Religious Scripture"... by Thomas Dagget.
Do you still believe... any of it?
- You're asking me as a cop?
- As a priest.
But I'm not a priest.
St. Christopher.
"Go your way in safety."
Do you believe... that you're part of God's plan,
Thomas?
That's a complicated question.
No, it isn't.
You found it, haven't you?
You can't keep it from us, Simon!
Well, look at this. Tommy Dagget actually lit by the light of morning.
What am I doin' here, Burrows? I work nights. It's not even my division.
Well, we'll get to that.
Our friend here did a half-gainer from the fourth floor.
Jumper?
Not unless he decided not to bother opening the window first.
Was he fucked up or what?
Well, he wasn't exactly in condition to walk a chalk line when we got here.
You're welcome to smell his breath, if you like.
He is missing one or two things, though.
- What's that?
- His eyes.
Maybe they're stuck in the radiator grill.
Who's the room registered under?
- John Smith.
- Anything interesting inside?
Well, there are what an experienced detective like yourself... could possibly construe as signs of a struggle.
Of course, nobody saw or heard anything.
- Place been dusted?
- Yeah. Nothing.
Kinda weird, huh, somebody carrying that around?
That's why Lieutenant Deason had me call you down on this.
Any ideas what it's doin' here?
No.
"For it was there at Nicene...
"that the world's fourth-century bishops...
"declared that with the sacrifice of God's Son man became one with God,
"for the first time lifted above all other creations...
"to stand at His side in Heaven."
You been holdin' out on me.
I never knew you could read and write.
That measures eight feet.
Where's Chimney Rock?
Arizona.
It's where I'll be in two years and three months.
You gonna give all this up?
You're breakin' my heart.
Don't forget to tip the maid.
Hey, what's the big idea of sitting out here all alone?
Someone's here.
Where?
Pig out on all the cake?
No.
But there, there might be one teeny, tiny little piece left.
But you'll have to race me for it.
- What's that?
- Where?
Oh, you sneak!
Tommy. A little early for you, isn't it?
Joseph.
- They got you workin' days?
- Yeah.
Huh.
Tyson, slow down.
- Everybody's dead.
- Do you got any more of this?
No.
All right, where do you wanna start?
Well, I think we could skip the cause of death.
Why don't we begin with his eyes?
Your man has none.
What, they weren't in the radiator grill?
No, I mean, he never had any.
No optical fibers, no muscle pores, zip.
We did a toxicology on his blood, you know,
- looking for the usual: coke, booze, sugar.
- What'd you come up with?
High sodium, elevated erythrocytes, no floating cholesterol platelets, trace of ammonia.
- What's so unusual about that?
- Oh, nothing. Nothing.
Actually, it's pretty common... for an aborted fetus.
- Fetus?
- We also did a bone section.
It wasn't much trouble; most of them were sticking out of his chest anyway.
Okay. And?
When a baby grows, their bones get larger... by having calcium layers form over the haversian canals. Are you with me?
- I'm with you.
- This leaves growth rings; everybody's got 'em.
Except our pal here.
Oh.
And this is for you.
He's also a hermaphrodite.
Ohh!
He's got both male and female sex organs.
- Think of the possibilities.
- Yeah.
He could be impotent and frigid at the same time. They don't normally work.
We found this in the lining of his coat.
- It's an old Bible.
- Yeah.
Handwritten.
Beautiful, really.
See this symbol?
Matches a scar on his neck.
Exactly the same.
That's attractive, huh?
Anything else?
There's a velvet book marker.
- Cute.
- What is it?
Twenty-third chapter of
St. John's Revelations.
And?
There is no 23rd chapter.
Well, maybe this is the teacher's edition.
- Can I keep this?
- Sign for it.
What are we gonna do here, Tommy?
Do me a favor... just sit on it for a couple of days, give me a head start... before the wolves start circling, OK?
Take your time.
"And there were angels who could not accept...
"the lifting of man above them,
"and, like Lucifer, rebelled against the armies of the loyal archangel Michael.
"And there rose a second war in Heaven."
"Lieutenant to the seraph or archangel Gabriel."
Gabriel.
Simon.
Mamacita.
Hey, cutie!
Hey, don't let the door hit you!
One-one thousand, two-one thousand, three-one thousand, four-one thousand, five-one thousand, six-one thousand, seven-one thousand, eight-one thousand, nine-one thousand, ten-one thousand.
You guys, I know you're here.
You guys.
I know you're in here.
Hello there, young lady.
Hi.
I'm Simon.
What's your name?
- Mary.
- Mary!
Mary.
That's a pretty name.
- Does Miss Henley know you're here?
- No, she doesn't.
No one does.
And I would like to keep it like that, if we can.
Do you think that you could not tell anyone that I'm here, just for a little while?
Okay.
- Come on!
- Come on! Come on!
- I have to go.
- Let's go!
Do you have to?
Are you hungry?
I could bring something.
That would be very nice, Mary.
Okay. Bye.
Gee, Jerry, you look like shit.
- Leave me alone, Gabriel.
- Soon, pal, soon.
- Come here.
- Go away.
Come here.
You still got a spark of life left in you.
- Fuck you.
- Hmm.
I want you to do something for me.
- Why don't you just let me die?
- Soon.
Honest.
Don't start.
You know how I hate that.
I'm so tired.
I'm so goddamn tired.
Watch the profanity.
One more favor.
- What?
- I want you to get something for me.
Some personal effects the cops took from the Gable Apartments... on Seventh Street.
It'll be sitting in a property room on San Julian.
And you just want me to waltz right in there like this, right?
Go in during a shift change.
- You got the name the stuff is under?
- John Doe.
- Oh. Why doesn't that surprise me?
- Number 12.
Bus fare.
7-8-25, code six.
105 North Vann, route 52.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Final spectrometry came back on that fancy Bible of yours.
If that new chapter's a forgery, it's an old one.
Carbon dating checks out second century.
That would make this Bible the oldest in existence then.
So don't lose it.
How's the translation going?
Well, from what I can make out so far, this thing seems to be mostly about angels and the second war in Heaven.
A second angel war?
Over what?
Us. Humans.
It says when God gave us a soul some angels became jealous... and they started this war.
Really? You translated all of that?
Well, when did it end?
It doesn't say it did.
It does prophesy a little, though.
Come on.
Let me show you something.
It's been a while here, so bear with me.
"And there shall be a dark soul,
"and this soul will eat other dark souls and so become their inheritor.
"This soul will not rest in an angel but a man, and he shall be a warrior."
Nice.
Very nice.
Let me ask you something.
Why wouldn't God just get rid of the bad angels?
I don't know. I don't know.
Maybe He can't.
- Maybe He won't.
- Come on.
Don't be so serious.
It's not like all this is real.
Well, what's in the basement is real.
And according to this, it's got a name.
Remember that symbol on his neck?
According to some ancient
Hebrew cabalists, that's angelic script for an angel named Uziel.
Are you saying we have a dead angel on ice?
- I'm gonna need to see a pass.
- Shh.
- Yeah.
- Stop it.
- Dork!
- It's over. Back to the real world of learning.
Wait up.
Brian, have you seen Mary?
- I think she's out back.
- Allison?
We haven't seen her since lunch.
Were you upstairs?
Mm-hmm. All right.
Until I get back
I want everyone reading... and being quiet.
Mary?
Mary?
- Mary, come here.
- But Simon and I were...
Now.
Ohh.
I'm not mad at you. I just want you to go back to class. Okay?
- Bye.
- Bye.
This is school property.
You can't sleep here.
It wasn't part of the plan.
Are you all right?
Not really.
I'll have to call the police.
I wish you wouldn't do that.
They can help you.
No.
Not me.
Please leave, Katherine.
Hi.
Well, now.
I thought you left.
I hid.
I'm very clever.
Oh, yes, you are.
Very clever.
Mary,
I have very little time left.
And since you have been so nice to me, there's something that I would very much like to give to you.
What?
Something very special.
Can you keep a secret?
The biggest secret ever?
What is it?
Come here.
Come here.
It's okay. Come here.
You're a very clever girl.
Close your eyes.
Mary?
Oh, honey.
- Are you okay?
- I don't feel good.
Did you...
Did you eat something?
- Can I go home now?
- Come on.
It's okay.
Emma?
Mary got really sick in school and I thought she should come home.
I don't feel very good, Grandma.
Come on, sweetie.
It's all right.
I'll have the school send for a doctor.
He was just lying up there.
Most of my deputies are at a tanker spill right now and they may be a while.
These people are rarely any problem.
I'll have one of the boys come down by tonight or tomorrow and shoo him out for ya.
All right. I mean, as, as, as soon as you can.
He was kind of strange.
All right, thanks.
Looks like one of those snow angels we used to make as kids, you know.
Lay down on a clean snowbank, swing your arms up and down.
You know what this means, don't you?
Our friend's cleaned out all our evidence on Mr. Doe here, everything.
Yeah.
- Guard get a good look at who nailed him?
- Yeah.
Tall.
Smiled a lot.
I think I have to go.
- Where?
- Chimney Rock.
Go.
Figure this out.
Then call.
Tell me I'm not crazy.
You like the desert,
Jerry?
You promised.
Soon! Don't be a pest about it.
Never trust a fucking angel.
I can't see, you know.
Hey, look, man, what the hell do you need me for, huh?
It's a big universe, Jerry.
Some things in it are talking monkey work.
Monkeys. Like you.
Oh. Well, that's great, Gabe.
Stop!
Stop the car!
Ahh.
I can always smell a graveyard.
# I went to sleep #
You enjoyin' yourself up there?
I always enjoy watching you work, Jerry.
How'd I ever get you in my life?
- Stop. You didn't really want to kill yourself.
- Oh, no, I did, actually.
I did kill myself, right?
- I mean, I did do it.
- Ahh, technically.
- So you're just keeping me alive.
- Letting you die slower.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks, man. I'm so in your debt.
Thank you, Jerry.
I'm touched.
Ohh! Fuck.
- Ah.
- Oh, fuck.
Don't hurt it.
Ah. There you go.
That's it.
Brush off. That's it.
Be very careful.
Open it up.
Whoa.
Ah, there it is.
Not much to look at.
It's not what's on the outside that matters.
It's what's on the inside.
Oooh!
You are looking at the cleverest, meanest, sickest talking monkey.
I love him.
Time to go.
Gimme a kiss.
It's not here.
- More bad news for the war effort, huh?
- Shut up!
Jerry, come here.
If you were a soul, where would you hide?
The hell away from you.
- Hi, Simon.
- Hi, Gabriel.
Long time.
You know why I'm here.
Oh, yes.
You don't have it on you, by chance.
- No.
- No.
That'd be too easy.
Sorry, man.
You know.
Simon.
Get serious.
So, where's the soul?
You know, bigger than a bread box; used to occupy the recently dead
Colonel Hawthorne.
You can't keep it from me, Simon.
The stalemate is over.
Why are you doing this, Gabriel?
I want what's mine.
I bow to no human in Heaven.
- But the Word...
- No one hears the Word anymore. No one!
- Without the Word...
- There's only the argument. I'll not step aside.
I will not allow any talking monkey... to take my place.
I'll burn down Heaven to stop it.
I'm so tired of this war.
Reject the lie, Simon.
Join us.
Help us make it like it was before the monkeys.
You remember?
We cast out Lucifer's army.
You and I.
We threw their rebel thrones from the wall.
- They wanted to be gods.
- I don't want to be a god, Simon.
I just want to make it like it was before the lie, when He loved us best.
Oh, Gabriel.
When was it that you lost your grace?
I'd like to help you, old friend, but I can't.
I'm not sure who's right, who's wrong, but it doesn't matter.
Sometimes you just have to do what you're told.
That's who we are.
You know, the great thing... about a conversation like this?
You never have to have it again.
You know the routine.
Yes.
Not yet!
Simon.
I can make this last forever.
This is getting boring, Simon.
Hey, man...
Where is it? Where did you put it?
Give it to me!
You're an abomination, Gabriel.
You'll never get that soul.
You're a tough one, friend.
Old school.
What's going on, John?
You may want to skip this one, Katherine.
Were any of your, uh, students up here?
Mary.
- How is she?
- Same.
- Has she seen the doctor yet?
- He found nothing.
But something is in her.
So we have called the hand trembler to find if she must have a sing.
"And there shall be a dark soul,
"and this soul will eat other dark souls and so become their inheritor.
"This soul will not rest in an angel, but a man,
"and he shall be a warrior."
How long ago was he buried?
- Which time?
- "Which time"? What do you mean?
Somebody dug him up last night.
Local hoods, probably.
I just finished puttin' him back.
- Did you call the sheriff?
- Sure.
They were busy up at the school this morning. Some wino burned himself up.
I expect I'll be buryin' him too.
Don't run!
Don't run.
Can I help you with something?
Yes, I'm Thomas Dagget with the police.
- Katherine Henley.
- I'd like to ask you a few questions.
- It's about that guy upstairs?
- That's right.
Well, sorry, but I kinda got my hands full right now.
Do you mind if I tag along?
- Here, let me help you with that.
- Make yourself useful.
- Hey, you forgot something!
- Thanks.
- What grade is this?
- Oh, it's all of them.
The town doesn't seem that small.
Well, after the copper mine closed, it sort of took most of the town with it.
Jade, you hurry back!
So we just teach out of this one corner now.
The rest of the school has been abandoned for years.
It's happened before, you know.
Homeless people just looking for a place to sleep.
Of course, no one's ever burned themselves up before.
Did you talk to him?
Yeah. I wanted to know what he was doing there.
- Did he say?
- No, he didn't say.
I mean, he looked like he was hurt.
Bloody, like somebody had cut him.
Is there something going on
I should know about?
Did any of the children come in contact with him, talk to him in any way?
- Yes.
- Which one?
Well, she's home, sick today.
I'd like to speak with her parents, if that's possible.
Well, her parents are dead.
She lives with her grandmother.
I'd have to ask her.
Did you know an Arnold Hawthorne?
The colonel.
Did you go to his funeral?
Everybody did. He lived here.
Any dark secrets?
There are no secrets in a small town,
Mr. Dagget, dark or otherwise.
Okay. Thank you.
Sure.
No, not really.
I mean, he lived here but...
- nobody ever really talked to him much.
- Have any family?
Nah, not Hawthorne. Town'll probably just auction this place.
- Yeah.
- Well, lock up when you're done.
- Okay, thanks.
- Sure.
It's unusual... to see someone your age in a church on a weeknight.
Don't get me wrong.
I think it's a sign of excellent character. You're not from here.
- What are you doin'?
- Looking for something.
- Did you find it?
- I will.
I found what you're looking for... Thomas.
Excuse me? Do I know you?
How do you know my name?
Ah, you look like a Thomas.
Hey. Look at me.
You want me to look at you? Huh?
You know how you got that dent in your top lip?
Way back, before you were born,
I told you a secret, then
I put my finger there... and I said,
"Shh."
Okay?
There and there.
Put your lips there.
Pucker your lips and blow.
Just a little bit.
This trumpet's special.
Very good.
Kevin.
Have a mint.
On me. Huh?
Oooh-ohhh.
What? What, you want an autograph?
Come on, get out of here.
Next.
- Sandra.
- How'd you know my name?
Well, you look like a Sandra.
You have very pretty teeth, Sandra.
- Thank you.
- Let's check 'em. Hmm? Ahh.
- Did you see the man upstairs, Sandra?
- A little.
- Did you talk to him?
- No.
Well, who did, Sandra?
Who talked to the man?
Mary.
- Where is Mary, Sandra?
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- I'm talkin' to the kids, ma'am.
- Sandra, come here.
Come here, honey.
The rest of you inside. Now. Go on.
- Bye, Gabriel.
- See you, kids. Study your math.
Key to the universe.
Bye, Gabriel.
- Who are you?
- That's a long story.
- Ignore him.
- Yeah, everybody else does.
Look, I don't know what's going on here, but I think you both should leave.
You're right.
You have no idea what's going on.
So you saw Simon.
What did he say to you?
- You weren't supposed to be here.
- Why? Is something wrong?
Emma.
It's okay, Mary.
You don't have to talk to him.
You don't have to talk to any of them.
He was just asking me about Simon.
Simon?
What did he say to you, Mary?
- He asked if I could keep a secret.
- What was that?
Something he gave me.
- What did he give you?
- Then it wouldn't be a secret.
You're a good friend not to tell, Mary.
But I'm a good friend of Simon's too.
So if you want to go ahead and say what it was, you can to me, okay?
It's a secret.
But sometimes it hurts.
Ever cut off a Chinaman's head?
They don't bleed.
Not like we do.
Or maybe it was just the cold.
You could always tell when they were coming.
Those songs.
They charge through the snow.
Their guns froze.
And that was okay because we were better.
Colder.
At Chosin, we were colder than anyone.
Make it stop, Miss Henley!
Make it stop!
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Make it stop! Make it stop!
Shh.
What are we gonna do?
She's going to have the enemy ghost way.
We leave this afternoon.
- Wh... Where's the ceremony?
- It's at her clan's village. Old Woman Butte.
You're gonna take her away?
This girl needs a doctor.
She's already seen a doctor.
Chinamen's heads? Chosin? I've never heard her talk that way before.
Is someone teaching that to your kids in class?
Yeah, sure.
Right next to Jack and Jill.
Colonel Hawthorne was at Chosin.
Did she talk to him?
She had no contact with him.
He hated children.
This isn't just about some drunk... who burned himself up at the school, is it?
Can you tell me the truth, Thomas?
Did you ever read the Bible, Katherine?
Long time ago.
Did you ever notice how in the Bible, whenever God needed to punish someone... or make an example, or whenever God needed a killing,
He sent an angel?
Did you ever wonder what a creature like that must be like?
A whole existence spent praising your God, but always with one wing dipped in blood.
Would you ever really want to see an angel?
Why are you asking me this?
They want Colonel Hawthorne.
They want a dead, forgotten, psychotic colonel.
They?
There was a man at my school this morning.
The children were calling him Gabriel.
He had Sandra on his lap.
What does he want with my kids?
I don't know, Katherine.
But I gotta find him.
I know where you can find him.
He was parked right here.
It's cold.
What's that?
I don't know.
It's angelic script.
Thomas?
No!
Saint John was right.
There's a war in Heaven.
Is Gabriel an angel?
He wants something.
Something that's here.
He wants Mary.
Thomas, he wants Mary.
Mary?
His car.
Get away from her.
Son of a gun. Priest.
Wanna-be. Figured it out.
- Mary?
- Shh.
She won't feel anything, honest.
I have to rip her apart, of course.
Just the way it goes. See, Simon hid
Hawthorne's soul inside her. I need it.
Nice Catholic boy like you, Mr. Dagget, you should be on my side.
Goddamn it!
You're gonna have to watch it with that profanity.
Mary.
Look in my eyes.
Come on, motherfucker!
Come on, fuck!
Thanks, man.
You're a sport.
Pest! Do you have any idea how hard it is to get one of those?
Why?
I'm an angel. I kill firstborns while their mamas watch.
I turn cities into salt.
I even, when I feel like it, rip the souls from little girls.
And from now till kingdom come, the only thing you can count on, in your existence, is never understanding why.
You, give me a kiss.
- Mary!
- Go! Go!
You... can't... have her!
Thomas!
- You don't understand. You gotta cuff him.
- He's dead.
He's not dead. You gotta cuff him, do you hear me?
- Bob, just do it.
- Do it!
All right, Jack. Cuff him.
Put him in my car.
- All right.
- They got him. They got him.
- Wh... Where's Mary?
- She's here. She's here.
Hey.
On Earth, they're not immortal.
They're not like you and me.
You've got to cut their hearts out.
Come on.
We gotta go.
Let's go. Let's go.
This is a good place.
Separate water source.
Stocked grain.
Only one possible approach.
A man could, with the proper defenses, hold off an entire battalion.
Hi.
Can I help you?
Yeah, someone's gonna die. Soon. Here.
I'll just be a minute.
Uh, there's no visitors allowed in I.C.U.
Timing is so important.
I smell these things.
Shh.
So.
"Nancy."
Recovering? Hmm.
Recovering? Huh.
Stable?
Get out of here.
Deteriorating.
Critical.
My favorite.
Rachael.
Not yet. Come back.
Come on back. Get up.
That's it. Come on back.
Ooh. Ahh.
- Hi!
- No, no, no, no, no.
Shh.
Don't start.
I hate that.
Come on, don't start.
It's only for a short time.
Promise.
Hello, Katherine.
We must talk.
- Oh, my God.
- God?
God is love.
I don't love you.
I... I can't.
I can't do this.
I can lay you out and fill your mouth with your mother's feces.
Or we can talk.
- Are you one of them?
- Them?
Are you an angel?
I am the first angel, loved once above all others.
A perfect love.
# But like all true love #
# One day it withered on the vine #
Ahh, the winged party boy is about.
Come to feed on the guts of your little Mary.
- Are you a part of it?
- No, Katherine.
Other angels have made this war because they hate you.
You and all humans.
God has put you in His grace and pushed them aside.
They're desperate. They've never been able to conquer the other loyal angels.
And so this war has remained in stalemate for thousands of years.
And while this state of affairs endures, no soul can meet its God.
Your parents and their parents and so on, from the beginning, lie still in wormy earth.
Of course, some of them do come to me eventually.
For while Heaven may be closed,
I am always open, even on Christmas.
Gabriel has a plan.
Humans... and how I love you talking monkeys for this... know more about war and treachery of the spirit... than any angel.
Gabriel is well aware of this... and has found a way to steal the blackest soul on Earth to fight for him.
If he wins, Heaven opens.
I know that this new Heaven will just be another Hell.
You see, I'm not here to help you and the little bitch... because I love you or because I care for you, but because two hells is one hell too many... and I can't have that.
What I'm offering you is a chance not only to save Mary, but to finally open Heaven to your kind.
What do you say?
I saw the devil tonight.
If you have something to say, why can't you say it to me?
Thomas.
I had a voice once, Katherine.
For as long as I could remember,
I had a voice... that called me to my God, that called me to church.
And on the day that I needed that voice the most, it left me.
It's better never having known that voice.
All I know is that I'm not going to let anything happen to Mary.
All right?
Say, ma'am, any idea where I can find
Old Woman Butte?
Yeah, it's on the reservation.
Don't suppose you could be just a tad more specific,
Madge?
The light.
It was so... br... bright.
- Isn't your friend hungry?
- What?
Not for a while, I'm afraid.
Funniest thing.
Don't do that.
- Take the 522 to the Sonsela Wash cutoff.
- Right.
First dirt road, go left 20, 25 miles.
You'll see it.
Much obliged.
Let's get crackin', Rachael.
No.
Eternity here.
In that sagging skin suit.
Or one more day with me.
Why?
Can't drive.
But I can wait.
Until the stars burn out, if you don't make up your mind.
I doubt we'll meet again.
- Suits me.
- Thank Heaven.
Little Tommy Dagget.
How I loved listening to your sweet prayers every night.
And then you'd jump in your bed, so afraid I was under there.
And I was.
Do you know what hell really is, Thomas?
It's not lakes of burning oil or chains of ice.
It's being removed from God's sight, having His Word taken from you.
It's hard to believe. So hard.
I know that better than anyone.
And there's your weapon.
Think, Thomas, think.
What is the one thing essential to an angel, the thing that holds his entire being together?
Faith.
Faith, faith.
And what would happen if that faith was tested, and an angel just like you... didn't understand?
Use that.
Use it!
He's coming.
Go inside, lock the door.
There's one shot.
Okay?
It'll be okay.
You're gonna love it, Rachael.
It'll be our night to howl.
Nice move.
Beautifully done.
Tommy, you've got to come work for me.
Upstairs.
I... I could get you in now.
You'll love it.
Nobody tells you when to go to bed.
You eat all the ice cream you want.
You get to kill... all day, all night, just like an angel!
Save yourself, friend!
Why go to the wall for that bitch and her rug rat?
It all turns out the same anyway. Now, later.
I'm gonna rip that kid apart.
I'm not an angel!
I'm just a man.
Which means I've got something you don't. It's a soul.
This is gonna really hurt.
Your war...
Make it good.
- Your war is a lie!
- Right.
It's not about humans.
It's about God.
What do you know about that, you monkey?
I don't have to, Gabriel.
I know you.
I know what it's like to be ignored, pushed aside.
I know your anger. I know what it's like to lose your faith in the Word.
I know.
'Cause you hate Him.
You hate Him just a little bit.
'Cause you're jealous.
That's what this war's about... jealousy.
Jealousy that He could love something more than you.
Something with a soul.
Well.
If you wanted to prove your side was right, Gabriel, so badly, why didn't you just ask Him?
Why didn't you just ask God?
Because...
He doesn't talk to me anymore.
Gabriel!
- I'm getting so fed up with you.
- Go to hell.
Heaven, darling, Heaven.
At least get the zip code right.
It's all the same to you, isn't it?
No. In Heaven, we believe in love.
- What do you love, Gabriel?
- Cracking your skull.
Kill me!
Oh, God!
Mary!
Go home.
Go home!
Finish it.
Long time.
This war is mine.
Your war is arrogance.
That makes it evil.
That's mine.
Lucifer, sitting in your basement, sulking over your breakup with the boss.
You're nothing.
Time to come home, Gabriel.
The enemy ghost is gone.
The war's over.
It's done.
No. I want you both to come home with me.
- Never.
- "I love you. I love you more than Jesus."
You owe me one.
- You're gonna ask me to take you home.
- No.
You will. Because anything else will be worse than you could ever imagine.
Katherine.
I have my soul.
And I have my faith.
What do you have... angel?
Leave the light on, Thomas.
Is he coming back?
I don't think so.
And in the end I think it must be about faith.
And if faith is a choice, then it can be lost... for a man, an angel... or the devil himself.
And if faith means never completely understanding God's plan, then maybe understanding just a part of it, our part, is what it is to have a soul.
And maybe, in the end, that's what being human is, after all.
Tales of monstrous, man-eating anacondas have been told for centuries by Amazon tribes.
Some are said to worship giant snakes.
Anacondas are ferocious, and enormous.
They can grow up to 40 feet long.
They do not merely eat their prey.
They regurgitate it in order to kill and eat again.
Please, help! Somebody, help!
This is an emergency. Somebody, please!
Please ...
ARlAU JUNGLE HOTEL, BRAZlL DEEP lN THE AMAZON
- Miss Flores. - Professor. When did you get in?
A couple of days ago. I've been out asking about our tribe.
- Any luck? - The evidence is they're out there.
And can be found... or so I told the grant people!
My guide thinks they're here. He found one of their markers.
- That's good! - I think we have a chance.
- Get me there, and I'll shoot it. - That's why I hired you.
- I appreciate the work. - I wanted the best director.
I think we'll make a good team.
You're a mess. What happened to you?
Just a small piranha attack. I barely escaped with my life.
- Somebody's up awfully early. - Well, today's a good day.
Not every day my home girl gets to direct a documentary.
- You ready? - I think so.
- Congratulations. - Thanks. ls this a pleasure cruise?
Come on... you know me. I don't mix business with pleasure.
Okay, what about... if we go up through here?
This way better. lf not, I cannot be responsible.
Well, it's only 55 kilometers more. Better safe than sorry.
- Mateo, you understand me? - Sure.
- I need some shots over there. - As you say, cheffe.
- For your approval. - Thanks.
- So, where's Westridge? He checked in. - Probably getting his beauty sleep.
Careful!
Careful! Bordeaux! Fragile. Expensive wine.
- Good morning. - Morning. How was your flight?
Actually, it was a bloody nightmare. Ongoing, I think.
- One zoom lens ... - You! Stow this in my room, will you.
Excuse me... I'm the production manager.
Then so do you can manage my things into my room!
One pompous ass ...
You know, in some cultures, that's a sign of friendship respect shows for asking you to carry their bags.
Respect this!
Mr Westridge Terri Flores.
Terri, this is a pleasure.
I've seen some of your films. I thought they were... promising.
- It's hot! Are we on the equator? - Welcome aboard... I guess.
- I think he likes you! - You felt that too?
It's Jacques Cousteau!
- Joinez-moi avec mon equipe. - Whatever the hell that means.
Its good to see you man.
Cheffe, ready for Rio Negro!
Everybody! Check your gear and pray you remembered bug spray.
Our adventure begins 1,000 miles from the mouth of the Amazon.
From here, we travel unexplored backwaters in search of the illusive... People of the Mist, the Shirishama tribe.
One of the last great mysteries of the Rain Forest. ls it just me, or does the jungle make you horny?
- Oh no... I think it's the jungle. - I'm serious, I've got one thing on my mind.
Can I work, please?
Help!
Save me! I'm stranded.
My boat is stranded in the ropes. Help me!
Check this out, there's a dude on a boat over there.
Hey! Pull over to his boat!
We'll bring you on board.
Thank the Lord for you! Thanks the Lord.
Are you hurt?
- Are you okay? - My propeller tore off in the roots.
We can't take you back to Manaus. We headed up river.
At the next village, I know the people. They help me fix my boat.
- I apologize for the trouble. - There's no need.
We're all at the mercy of machines. Yours broke.
Mateo, vamonos.
- Fish, river style! - Not bad!
We should get that on film next time.
- Ever work in a sushi bar, Mr...? - Sarone. Paul Sarone.
- Where are you from, Mr. Sarone? - Paraguay.
- Really? - I studied to be a priest.
But then I needed to see the real world.
So I ended up in the jungle. I seem to fit.
So, what does a failed priest do in the jungle?
Failed? Who says I failed? I didn't fail.
I'm sure you didn't. So what is your calling now?
- Snakes. - Snakes?
I catch them.
For zoos and collectors.
- Whatever they want - Poaching?
Poaching is illegal. May I ask you... What are you hunting?
We're not hunting or trapping anything.
We're making a documentary on the Shirishama lndians.
- The People of the Mist? That's right - You know of them?
- I've seen them. - Really... could you show me where?
You saved my life. I can show you exactly where I saw the Shirishama.
So slurs every river rat after five whiskies in any Manaus bar.
Five whiskies? That's breakfast on the river.
Does salad go well with fish river style?
Salad would be perfect, little baby bird.
Look at that.
Are they fireflies?
Pretty, huh? Family Lampyridae.
They use their night flashes to announce that they're ready to mate.
- Who flashes? Males or females? - Both, actually.
The females with short, dainty, feminine flashes...
- and the males with long, drawn-out, manly flashes.
I like that. No pick-up lines, no misunderstandings.
Just instinct and nature.
I've missed you.
Bloody racket!
Hey! Don't touch my radio!
I could cheerfully hire someone|to kill you.
- 15 dollars should cover it. - I could just kill you for free.
- You and whose army? - Your mama's!
So...are we getting close?
- Just around this bend. - Perfect.
A snake totem pole.
It's the Shirishama's.
Shirishama worship giant snakes. Anacondas. As gods and protectors.
They have a legend of a journey to a sacred lake.
First you pass a waterfall but that could takes you by warrior snakes.
Once you pass the guardian Then you travel through the land of the Shirishama,
- until you come to a wall so high, it blots out the sky...
Then after five days, you reach the head of a giant anaconda.
- You know the story. - Of course, a beautiful legend...
I believe... however its a legend of the Maku.
- Also the Shirishama. - Not to my knowledge.
Their village was right here. They're down this fork.
- I know. I trap snakes, for living. - And I'm sure you're good at it. l locate tribes for living. I'm very good at that.
The water level is high, so my calculation means that the area at this side will be flooded.
So our tribe would seek higher ground over here.
- Which way? - This way.
I want a shot of you with the totem. Gary, roll sound.
Camera rolling. Action!
Our first piece of luck: a Shirishama idol.
I know what I know. Leave me at the next village.
With pleasure.
What the hell was that all about?
- We'll go get some wild sound. - Just be careful.
See you guys.
Gary...
It's unbelievable.
- Gary ... - What?
Oh my God!
Wait.
Do you hear that?
The silence.
- What was that? - I don't know.
Mateo, shine the light over there.
These two are fortunate to be alive.
- What happened? - You should have seen it!
He just blasted this thing coming right at us.
Wild boar. Gores with his tusks. Goes for the eyes.
- Denise, are you okay? - Yeah, thanks.
- Everybody stays on board at night. - That's a smart idea.
Mateo, let's cut him up. Food for a week.
Food?
- My turn? - It's my turn.
Mateo, do you have control of this vessel?
Lie, if you must.
The rope's caught in the propeller.
I'll cut us loose.
Let me. This river can kill you 1,000 ways.
I can handle it. The only thing I'm afraid of is the candiru acu.
It's a tiny little catfish. It swims up into your urethra
- spreads its little spines and refuses to budge.
- You have to cut it out. - That's it! I'm going back to L.A.
Terri, something's wrong!
Cale?
- He's hurt. I'm going. - Hold up!
Hurry up! ls he breathing? Faster, come on!
Hurry!
What is it?
Careful.
- Get something for his head. - He's not breathing.
There's something in his mouth.
- Oh my God! - Damn! What's that?
A wasp. Deadly. Poisonous.
He's still not breathing. What do we do?
- How did this happen? - Alcohol.
I've got whiskey in my flask.
- Quickly. - What's that for?
- He's breathing! - That's it. He'll be all right.
- He seems okay, we should go now. - The radio don't work.
- I can't fix, okay? - We can start now.
No... fog.
We must get him to hospital soon, or he'll die.
What? Terri, we got lights.
Good. Mateo, we'll just double back.
Fighting the current, lose two days.
Cut back to this tributary, save us fifty miles.
- This the route you suggested that we take yesterday. - Yesterday for a different reason.
Now, it's to get Professor Cale to hospital as fast as possible.
I hope you know what you're doing. I don't know about this dude.
What choice do I have?
What the hell is this? Terri, come here.
- This is the river you know? - No, this is new.
But no cause for panic.
I'm not panicking. I'm just looking at this wall blocking our way.
- Let's see what we can do. - Its that dynamite?
It's always good to be prepared.
Prepared for what?
- That thing must be there for a reason - Yeah, to keep us out.
I'm talking about upsetting the ecological balance of this river.
I can blow it in ten minutes, so if you feeling sensitive, we can turn around and lose two days.
It's up to you.
Terri?
For God's sake, blow the bloody thing!
Just give me ten minutes, people. Ten minutes.
I need some help. Gary, get the little boat.
- There's something down there. - That's right.
I really mean it.
I really mean it too.
Hurry.
Damn it! Snakes!
- Babies! - How do we get them off the boat?
Come on babies, come on back to your Mama.
They're not all babies.
Calm.
- You little shit! - Sarone, help him, get it off.
Someone get this bloody thing off my hand!
- So young, and so lethal. - Get it off me!
Later, Sweetie!
- You knew there were snakes here! Didn't you Sarone.
- It was a pleasant surprise.
- What about the fuel?
- There's only one drum left that's enough for about 100 km.
About a day's ride. That will have to do.
Back to your mother.
- How's he doing? - He's breathing normally now.
That's good.
- We'll get him home. - I just don't know what's going on, you know.
Sarone supposed to help us get back to the hospital, right?
But he acts like he owns this river.
And we run into a barrier full of snakes. Where's he taking us?
Mateo... Mateo. Stop the boat.
- Stop it. Why are we stopping now?
There'll be fuel.
- You know that boat? - There's lots of boats like that.
Hello!
I get the impression there's nobody home.
Mateo, come with me.
Hold up.
- I'll get this on film. - You don't need sound, do you?
Go aft.
Sarone!
- Kind of spooky. - You think so?
What the...
- Help me. - What's that?
Treasures.
Here.
Be careful, my camera's in here.
Mateo, that's it let's go!
Hei... I'm coming. I'm coming.
What's all this?
- And what about the fuel? - There wasn't any fuel.
- Where's Mateo? - I don't know, he was right behind us.
Mateo!
- I'm going back. - Sarone, go with him.
- Maybe some other time. - Asshole.
We stuck in the middle of nowhere, and now we've lost our driver!
Mateo!
Come on man, stop playing!
Danny?
Danny?
Danny?
- Yeah. - You okay?
- I'm all right. I didn't see him. - How very reassuring!
- This is it. - This is all you found?
- What the hell is this? - Anaconda skin.
- Is snake out there this big? - It's skin maybe four years old.
It's grown by now. Something like this made a meal of our captain.
- Snakes don't eat people. - Oh... they don't?
Anacondas are perfect killing machines. They have heat sensors.
A warm body like Mateo's in the water, wasn't hard to find.
They strike, wrap around you. Hold you tighter than your true lover.
You get to hear your bones break before your veins explode.
- Mateo's probably just lost. - Oh, wake up! lmagine capturing it alive. That's worth a lot of money, Gary.
Please people, don't make me out to be a monster. I didn't eat the Captain Mateo.
Come on, everybody... We are not sure that Mateo is dead.
- So, we'll wait here till morning. - Are you insane?
You think he went for a walk? We've got to get out of here.
- Get a grip Westridge!! - I've got a grip.
We're not leaving. lf it was you, you'd want us to stay too.
Listen! lf it was me out there, I'd be dead. Don't you see.
- Just, go into your cabin, and lock the door. - Like a bad boy.
All right. All right.
Where are my shoes?
- We'll aim some lights at the boat. - That's a good idea.
I'm not so sure he didn't eat the captain.
He sure looks satiated.
You think he's still alive?
No. Let's go to bed.
Danger...
Danger is exciting, huh, Gary?
You go on to bed, I'll just talk to him a second.
- Hurry up, I'm scared. - I'll be right there.
- So... It's out there, isn't it? - Yeah.
- And you know how to catch this things right? - That's right.
But you can't catch anaconda by yourself, you need a partner.
Capture alive... Maybe a million dollars, Gary.
REPTlLE TRANQUlLLlZER
Still no Mateo.
Keep it steady, Westridge!
- What the fuck are you doing? - Anaconda bait.
Oh my God!
- Westridge, let's go. - Stop! Not on my boat.
You speak for everybody? Gary? Does she speak for everybody?
Gary?
With Cale sick, the movie's off. Why not salvage something?
Let's film Sarone capturing the big snake.
- Have you lost your mind? - No, I'm completely lucid.
I think it's you guys who need to open your eyes.
Are we go for taking Cale to hospital, now we're catching a snake?
You know where you're, you're in the middle of the jungle!
All you guys do is question and criticize.
But just remember, you don't know shit about all this. Neither do l.
But I know who does. This guy! Paul has been here. lf we help him catch the snake, then he'll help us get out of here, alive.
And that is common freaking sense.
Come on, Gary, this isn't you! Honey, what did he do to you?
Stop. Think of the money. lmagine capturing something like this on film for the first time ever.
Just to be honest, what else we suppose to do?
I know what I'm doing. I'm gonna throw you two in the river by myself!
- I don't think so. - I didn't want this to happen people.
- Let's go, Westridge. - Ok.
Gary.
Occupy yourselves. Play some cards.
Nobody move!
Gary, turn on the lights!
Westridge, stop the boat.
Buenas noches!
- Come down here, Westridge. - You'll get us killed!
That's it, go for the eyes! Blind it!
Fishing for snakes! He's crazy!
- Just let it go. - Westridge, come here! Come down here!
Where is it?
Don't move. I'll tranquillize it.
Denise, get up here! Get up here!
Gary, help me!
- Get up here! - Grab her, man!
It's in the water.
Gary, give me your hand.
No! it's no good to me dead.
Gary!
Oh God!
May the souls of the faithful departed...
... through the mercy of God rest in peace.
- Westridge! - How dare you!
It was you who brought that snake. You brought the devil.
There's a devil inside everyone. Horrible.
Westridge.
Take my gear up to the pilot house.
- I'm not your bloody poodle. - What?
- You presume to order me about? - Presume?
How you like I presume to throw you in the river?
- Take it upstairs. - Thank you.
Everyone else, don't move.
Get back.
Terri, let's talk.
You want something?
I just want to talk to you.
I was thinking about the myth.
I don't know, I figure all about this, this film was supposed to be my big break.
And it's turned out to be a big disaster.
So I was just thinking -
- that maybe I could film you capturing the snake.
And then it wouldn't have all been for nothing.
I don't know it could be dangerous.
I know.
But you'd be there to protect us.
You need protection?
It's been a long time... since I had a woman.
You think I'm stupid?
I'm not stupid!
- Shall I hit him again? To make sure... - No just throw him in the river!
Haven't we enough of that?
- I'm afraid I'd rather enjoy it. - Come on, just tie him up! Ok.
This was all one big setup, huh?
Mateo, you stranded, the shipwrecked boat...
- Your route to the hospital. - You forgot the wasp.
What you do is not so hard. I can trap a snake, too.
As smart as you are, you can survive without me.
We're gonna be home soon, okay?
I can't believe how good you're doing. Hang in there, baby.
- ls it hard to drive? - No. Like a Cadillac Fleetwood.
I tell you up... I'll give you a driving lesson.
Black knobs: Up to get forward and down here back.
Red knobs: Up to get fast and down to get slow.
Wheel: left and right. You get any trouble, turn off the ignition.
Take it for a spin. Take us back to civilisation.
- Shit, no problem! - Take us back to...
- Crisp sheets and hot showers. - The play-offs and a six-pack!
- Golf, and a gin and tonic. - L.A. traffic and mobile phones.
Don't start!
The waterfall. A beautiful sight, baby bird.
- The legend was right. - What is this place?
Oh dear. It's absolutely beautiful.
- What the hell was that? - I think we hit the bottom.
Turn the wheel hard over left.
All right, put it in reverse.
Shut it down.
We got to winch ourselves loose.
Wait, wait what are you doing? And get in the water?
We ain't got much choice. We'll wrap a rope around that tree.
You wrap a rope around that tree. pull it tight or we're stuck here forever.
- We've got to make it quick, in and out. - I rather hoped I'd done my bit.
- That's our rope. - Just enough to go round the tree right?
Yeah.
Take this and get it around that trunk, make sure it's secure.
Roger that.
Last time I tried this, I had to pick leeches off my scrotum.
Aren't you going to pray?
Never look in the eyes of those you kill.
They will haunt you forever. I know.
I firmly resolve...
... with help and grace to confess my sins...
... and amend my life. Amen!
Sanctus... sanctus... sanctus...
... baby bird.
Hurry up.
Shit! back on the boat. Now! Come on!
Go!
Get on the boat. Go on, hurry!
Over here, you fat-ass bastard!
Westridge... get up on the rocks.
- Go! - Get up on the rocks.
It's coming. Go!
- Go get the gun. - What are we gonna do?
Go, get it!
Hurry up!
- Westridge, keep going! - Danny, watch out!
Danny move your arm!
Danny! Danny!
- Danny. - Yeah.
Westridge! Westridge! Shit!
Come on, hurry up!
I'm caught.
Come on Danny, hurry up.
Danny, hold on!
You killed my warrior snake.
Get up.
The dart.
The tranquillizer's working. Get him!
Damn, the dart came out his back.
Come on, almost there.
Baby ..? He's lost consciousness again.
I'll try to get us out. The tree knocked us loose.
Terri, look.
- They might have some fuel. - Let's check it out.
- Need some help? - No, I'm cool.
I don't even want to know what happened here.
I hope they got some fuel.
Damn!
Those drums... Could be fuel.
A snake skin.
- Look there's plenty of fuel in here. - Welcome!
Time to wake up.
- Monkey blood. - I'm gonna kill you, Sarone!
Don't get me upset.
See this?
Human bones. That's how it comes out.
Ashes to ashes ...
Shit, Oww! shit, look!
Come on.
Go!
Gotcha!
Get loose.
Let's get the fuel. Let's out of here!
Don't worry, just go! Run! It's coming for you.
Danny, where are you?
- It's a nest. - I'll go up the smokestack.
- No, I've got the legs. - We can trap it there.
Go!
- Can you climb out? - I can use the rope.
Hurry, I think I can blow him up.
- I'm going to light it. - Go ahead, I'm at the top.
Danny!
- Get out, the fuse is lit. - Danny, wait!
Push on the other side hit the hinges.
- Terri jump! - I can't, it's too high.
Just jump!
I got you. Come on.
Did we get him?
We got him.
You all right?
We should get the fuel, so we can get out of here.
Come on.
Bitch.
Let's get out of here.
Miss Flores...
You're a mess.
I found another one. Let me see that.
Shirishama.
- Sarone was right. - Danny!
- Damn... I'll get the camera. - You think so?
- Aright, roll film! - Camera rolling.

Aw, come on now, I pay you two bucks a day, don't I?
Get off your lazy ass and come and help me!
Cut me some slack, will ya?
I'm workin' hard too, you know.
Now what?

Ow. Shit, man.

It's a little temperamental.
You have to be gentle.
Gentle, my ass. The whole system just cracked out on me.
- Killed off by your negative vibes, no doubt.
- No doubt.
Are you hitting that thing again?
No.
[Mutters in Korean language]
You know, where is it written that I have to go out there and work?
I mean, you know, Finnegan, why don't you get your ass out there sometime?
I love you too, Leila.
- Everything all right?
- Just peachy.
[Man]
We are on schedule, are we not?
- [Finnegan] You didn't hire me for my social graces.
- [Hanover] That's right.
We hired you for your reputation.
You better live up to it.
- Where are we?
- Right there. Middle of nowhere.
- And our final destination?
- Right... there. Middle of nowhere squared.
Finnegan.
Yeah, I heard of you.
But I thought you'd be older.
Like a fine wine, I'm ageing gracefully.
Thank you.
Like a fine wine, my ass. You look more like a keg of beer to me.
[Laughs]
Any questions,
Mr Finnegan?
Nope. I get paid to shut up and do my job.
So I shut up and do my job.
You're not the least bit curious as to where we're going?
Like the sign says,

If I could have your attention for just one moment, please.
On behalf of myself,
Captain Atherton and his crew... welcome to the maiden voyage of the Argonautica!
[Cheering]
Each and every one of the hundreds of men and women in service upon this vessel, has but one objective:
To make your dreams come true.
As for myself, my entire life...
I have had but, one dream.
To create the greatest most luxurious, most expensive, pleasure ship ever built.
And tonight, seeing all of you here... so beautiful, so elegant, so rich.
[Laughing]
I realize that my dream has come true, and I thank all of you from the bottom of my heart for making it so.
To the Argonautica!
Good times forever!

Forever!

[Passengers Laughing, chattering]
This ship is so smooth we can't believe it!
[Captain] She's state-of-the-art.
Not another ship like her, ma'am.
She can hit a 40-foot swell and not even put a ripple across your Martini.
It's been very nice meeting you people.
I hope you enjoy the rest of the cruise.
Thank you, so much.
- Oh, excuse me.

Really very sorry.

Yeah. So?
I'm a growing boy, you know.
- You're still growing?
- You got a problem with that?
- Be happy I don't eat you.
- So what you realizing, Mamooli?
Uh, well, that my goal in life before I die... is to make love to a woman from every country on Earth.
Like, countries acknowledged by the
U.N.? Or like, made-up countries too?
- What the hell does that mean?
- Like T. Ray's country.
Shut your face, Billy.
Australia's a country.
- Australia's an island.
- Well, technically, it's a continent.
Ah, shit, man. Island, country, continent. If there's women there, well, I'm interested.
You come to my country,
I'll shoot your ass.
Does he ever talk about anything else but women?
Nah, not that I recall. The only way to shut him up is to shoot him.
- Yeah, that's right.
- Yeah?
- [Gun cocking] You ever thought about it?
- [Man] Every day.
- [Knife Unsheathing] Oh, ooh, ooh.
- [Man] Come on, boys.
- Sit down, right?
- Oh, ooh. [Chuckling]
Go back to Australia.
- [Belches]
- You know what I want to eat?
I'll take a couple of nice, greasy pig's feet, some pickled monkey brains and one of them big elephant eyeballs, so they pop when you bite in to them.
- [Men Laugh]
- [Blowing Smoke]
Yummy. [Chuckles]
[Vomiting]
[Men Laughing]
You like that?
- Oh, man, that's disgusting.
- T. Ray, you stinking up the place.
Shut up.
Hey, knock it off.
You're not getting paid to party.

You're not where I think you are, are ya?
Hola.
Listen, this radar's still funky. I can feel it, and it's a very bad feeling.
You know how many uncharted islands are out here?
- I know, two.
- Oh, that's very funny.
Wait till I crash this rig into some god-damned no name island.
What is this, a talk show?
I need some quiet time.
Over and out.
Whoa. Nasty.
[Hydraulic Lift Hissing]
Whoa.
Hit you.
Holy, shit.
"Holy, shit."
- I'm feelin' a real lack of love here.
- Get in there!
- [Billy] Ow.
- Well, what do we have here, fellas?
I found him snooping around the cargo.
If there's anything I can do to make your trip more comfortable, you come to me.
- Okay? - G'day, mate. [Men Shouting,
Pantucci Grunting And Groaning]
[Fighting Sounds in Headset]
Well, don't just sit there!
Go help him!
Are you kidding me?
Those guys are dangerous.
- No shit. You've got to do something.
- I find you live longer if you don't.
Finnegan!
[Punches Landing,
Men Laughing]
[Pantucci Moaning, Panting]
We got a contract, twenty hours out and back.
You beat my engine man to death, it's gonna take a hell of a lot longer.
Which is okay by me, since overtime will run you double rate.
He was nosin' around in my cargo.
Okay, so he's nosey.
Contract was, no questions asked.
Yow, fellas, I vote we kick this little piece of shit overboard.
[Grunts]
Well, I vote we kill him.
I vote we kill him.
Then we throw him overboard
Well, we don't vote here.
See, it's not a democracy.
Okay. I'll say it one more time for the hearing impaired.
[Billy Grunts]
[Guns cocking]
[Knife Unsheathing]
This could be messy.
Vivo.
Everybody okay?
Anybody gonna shoot anybody?
You know. You boys need to get out more often.
That's a year off my life.
[Thunder, Lightning Crashing]
[Computer voice]
Please enter your security key card.
[Computer voice] Good evening,
Captain Atherton.
- Good evening to you.
- The vault is now open.
Choices, choices, choices.
Oh, you're a big, bad boy, aren't ya?
Hmm... You're more my size.
[Clearing throat]
Good evening, mademoiselle.
Hello.
Red-handed. My God, what a cheeky little trollop you are.
Good evening gentlemen,
I was just on my way out.
- Or maybe not.
- A good decision.
There's no place to run. The nearest land is... what is it about, 600 miles, captain?
- Nearer 800, sir.
- According to this fax we received...
- Oh, that's not a very flattering photograph, is it?
- Let me see.
You're wanted for burglary, robbery, forgery.
Ohh... and attempted murder.
My ex-boyfriend.
[Canton laughs] What?
6 arrests, 5 convictions and wanted in 4 countries.
How does a beautiful woman as young as yourself a mass such an incredible record?
Trust me, it wasn't easy.
I think it's because you're not very good at what you do.
Hey, steady on, Canton.
No need for that.
Uh-uh! I believe that's my card.
- Thank you.
- Captain, do we have a brig on this ship?
Yes, we do, sir.
But it's not finished yet.
- You can't put a lady in the brig!
- True.
But you, mademoiselle, are no lady.
Hey, watch it!
[Sighs]
Hmm. And you, Mr Canton, are no gentleman.
[Pantucci moans]
They must be 30 feet long, man.
They're not nukes or nothing, but the bang sure would make your butt pucker.
You ever pull that shit again,
I'll kill you myself.
Hold still, you big dummy.
I'm sorry. It stings! Hey, do you think we could pull over?
You got anything to numb the pain.
Aw, yes, my little love bug,
But just a little.
- I think I need a higher dosage.
- You always need a higher dosage.
- Hey, Tucci. How many of those things are there?
- Huh?
I don't know. At least 8 or 9 of 'em.
Enough to sink a damn aircraft carrier.
This is just great. Now I got bombs in my basement.
You know, maybe it's just me, but if you'd ask a question or two before accepting a job...
[Pantucci] If the cash is there, we do not care.
What kind of life philosophy is that, man?
Torpedoes. What the hell are they gonna do with torpedoes?
[Computer beeps]
Yes!
[Hanover] Gentlemen.
Say hello to the Chinese...
M1 - L1 triple-pulse assault rifle.
Rotating barrel, thousand-round capacity.
- Auto cooling, watertight.
- Yeah!
Cheers, babe.
Mmm.
Mmm.
[Electronic Whirring, Beeping]
[Beeping continues]
[Crew Members Chattering]
What?
[Captain]
What's happening here, gentlemen?
Communications, what's your status?
All thermal and laser imaging generating a negative white screen response, sir.
- That's impossible.
- Captain, radar not responding either, sir.
Right. Switch to auxiliary power, Mr Lewis.
Let's do a circuit check.
No response, sir. We have a complete mainframe meltdown.
- What about the communications gear.
- Gone. All of it completely gone.
- Maybe it's the storm, sir.
- No, no. That's nonsense.
- [Canton] This ship is impervious to weather.
- [Captain] Can we still send?
Our signal goes all ecstatic, sir. I've never seen anything like it.
This equipment is state-of- the-art!
Top of the line!
Mr Canton, please!
We are in a very dangerous situation here.
Without radar or any form of imaging; we are sailing blind.
- No bloody way to communicate our situation.
- I have something here, sir.
- What is it, Colin?
- I don't know, sir,
But, whatever it is... it's big.
Probably just a pod of whales.
Moving at 31 knots, sir?
I don't think so.
- Where's it coming from?
- Directly beneath us, sir.
160 meters directly beneath us and rising very quickly.
150 meters.
110. 100 meters.
Ninety, eighty.
- Seventy, sixty.
- [Canton] What are they?
Fifty meters.
[Crashing, screaming]
[Woman] Oh my god.
[Passengers Screaming]
[Man] Open up!
[Woman sobbing]
[Metal Screeching,
Ship Rumbling]
[Squishing Sound]
[woman screams]
Hey! Who said you can put holes in my boat.
I didn't say you could put holes in my boat!
That's gonna cost you extra you know!
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.
[Man]
Let's go!
Looks like some kind of...
It's a torpedo launcher.
- I... I don't like this.
- Yeah, I know. Neither do I.
- How much longer?
- Another 22 minutes, we'll be right on top of, uh, whatever's out there.
[Radar Pinging]
What the hell was that?
Hang on!
[Explosion and screams]
[Alarm Beeping]
Joey! Joey, talk to me! Damage?
- Yeah. We got a hole on starboard bow.
- Taking water?
A little, but it's
Just above the water line.
I got no power coming from Jezebel.
She's out cold.
[Leila] Something's wrong with Hercules.
He's not getting any petrol.
That's it. I'm shutting her down.
Shit! What the hell did we hit?
Get it off the cases!
What the hell was that?
Whatever it was, it nearly took my bloody head off!
[Laughing]
[Mamooli] What are you laughing at?
Cause we're alive you idiot.
A direct hit on any of these warheads and pfft! We'd be history, mate.
We got a hole in the starboard bow the size of Nebraska!
What's the status down here?
Old Jezebel got it right through the brain pan.
- [Hanover] What did we hit
- [Finnegan] You got me.
[Pantucci] - I think we killed the speed boat.
- Speed boat.
We're hell and gone from the nearest land.
There's no way a speedboat gets out this far. No way.
Ow! Shit, man! Finnegan, nothing works! Hercules is shot to shit.
His gears are all mangled.
His cylinder head seized up, I think.
We're leaking fuel fast.
I'll give us 20 minutes, half an hour tops, and then we're dead in the water.
Finnegan, you do something.
We have a job to finish, a schedule to maintain.
- Man, would you listen to this crap?
- Shut up, grease monkey!
You're expendable! You know what I mean?
Yeah I know. Story of my life.
Hey, get your asses up here!
There's something out there.
- What? Let me see. Let me see it.
- Could you just...
Whoa. It's a...
It's a cruise ship.
Do you think she can spare us some fuel.
And a few minutes in her machine shop.
[Together]
Absolutely.
[Finnegan] What the hell...
[Guns cocking]
We'll take over from here.
You know, Hanover..
A ship like that, they got half a dozen different ways to call for help.
Not any more.
Pantucci. Can you fix this thing.
If I can get into the Love
Boat's machine shop... yeah, maybe I can fix this hunk of junk.
She ain't gonna run pretty, but she'll run.
[Softly] They've armed all the bombs, man. They're alive.
All right.
Finnegan and the grease monkey will come with us.
Wait a minute. The three of us stick together.
From now on, you'll be sticking with me.
- Billy!
- Yeah, Chief.
Finish the torpedo launcher and watch the lady.
Aye, chief.
I'll watch her. I haven't done, Korean.
Hey, Mr Comedy, leave my girlfriend out of this.
- Get the fuck off me.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Behave yourself.
She'll eat you alive anyway.
Hey! Knock this shit off.
This is worse than high school.
Cruise ship's not movin'.
Why ain't it movin'?
I don't know.
All right, gentlemen.
- You know the drill.
- Okay, let's move out!
[Alarm Beeping]
Bingo.
[Finnegan] Relax, Hanover.
This is a cruise ship.
- You're not gonna need your guns.
- What if they attack us, man?
With what? Margaritas and tanning oil.
This place is a mess.
You want me to call housekeeping?
[Hanover] Use any and all force necessary.
The intimidation factor must be high.
There's a lot of passengers on this ship.
Yep. And half of them are packing lipstick.
Be careful you don't get glossed.
That was kind of fun.
Well, it was.
Everybody's in the atrium.
We'll pin 'em down there, then split up and finish the job. Sound off!
- We got the bow.
- Level six.
- Casino.
- Level three.
- Bridge!
- Bow, top level.
- Here come the party crashers.
- [Pantucci] I don't here any party
[All Yelling]
Everybody down! Nobody move!
Shit.
Man. Looks like somebody had themselves one hell of a shindig.
We got blood here.
We got blood here too, mate.
We got blood everywhere.
[Bell Dings, Machinery Whirs]
[Level Indicator Beeping]
I got a really bad feelin' about this.
The doors are closing.
Where the hell is everybody?
Well, the lifeboats, they're all still here.
Where the hell is everybody?
Let's go!
[Thunder Crashes]
Shit. Hanover.
Nobody home.
This place looks post evac, man.
Total spooky town.
Looks like somebody beat you to the punch.
- Where the hell is everyone?
- Who cares, mate? Let's hit the vault and go.
[Fizzing]
[Rapid gunfire]
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!
Shh.
[Chuckles]
Fuck me, man.
[Both Yell]
[Gunfire Barrage Resumes]
[Hanover]
All right, knock it off!
I don't know what the hell's going on around here, but we've got a job to do.
- Machine shop.
- Sub level nine.
T. Ray, Mamooli, take Finnegan and the grease monkey.
Take the freight elevators.
They're the only ones that go all the way to the bottom.
The rest of you come with me to the bridge.
- Lets move, now.
- Come on.
[Moans]
[Groaning Sound]
What the hell was that?
[Sighs]
Whatever.
[Whispers]
Yes. Not bad.
Clear.
[Soft Beeps, Static]
The man did a good Job of shutting everything down.
Yeah. But he wasn't supposed to stop the ship.
- Or kill everybody on it.
- I don't see any bodies.
It's like... It's like everyone just... vanished.
[Metallic Rumble]
Hey, is that you?
[Water Moving, Gurgling]
Turn up the pump, you idiot!
We're sinking.
Relax, would ya. You're not the boss of me.
I'm the one supposed to be in charge around here.
[Water Lapping, Gurgling]
[Soft Snorting Sound]
[Leila Screams]
[Gasping, Shrieking]
[Hanover in Headset]
- Billy, Billy, are you there? - What?
We've looked all around, there aren't any passengers.
What do you mean no passengers?
How could there be no passengers?
- Have you seen anybody out there?
- Nah. I haven't seen anybody.
Only an idiot would be out in this rain.
[Screaming]
The hulls on these ships are supposed to be impregnable.
[Mamooli]
So what are you sayin'?
If the hull's impregnable, why are my feet wet?
It's a ghost ship. I vote we leave.
Who votes we leave?
Shut up.
Mate, that's it.
They thought they were sinking, so they abandoned ship.
Stupid bastards.
Oh, my God. He's right.
You're right. Yeah.
They all jumped overboard.
You know, I can just see the last, asshole in saying. "Shit, yes, we forgot the lifeboats, guess we're just gonna have to swim for it".
You got a real big mouth on you, you know that?
Yeah, I know that.
I don't like you.
You don't even know me.
Hey, check it out.
It's my future ex-wives.
[T. Ray] Mamooli, you bloody pervert, get your mind out of the gutter.
- Come on, hurry it up.
- Whoa, man! What stinks?
Did I say it was you.
[Mamooli]
Man, this water's freezing!
[Mamooli sings]
[Growling Sound Nearby]
Oh-ee, whoo. Mm-mmm.
Which one of you ladies wants to warm me up.
Hey, stay close.
- I didn't know you cared.
- I care about your gun.
Mamooli, keep an eye on 'em.
Mmm.
What you got there?
- Peanut.
- Peanut?
- Peanut.
- Okay. Peanut.
[Plop] [peanut falls in water]
Shit!
[Soft Growl]
[Growl]
Hey!
[Soft Growl]
Who's in there?
[Growls Continue]
You come out now, or I'm gonna kick your ass.
[Mamooli in Headset]
T. Ray, what the hell you doin', man?
[Growling]
[Splashing]
[Growl]
What is that?
[T. Ray Screaming]
T. Ray?
T. Ray?
What did you do.
- Huh?
- Hey! What did you do?
Don't shoot!
Well, what happened to T. Ray?
What did you do to him?
We didn't do anything!
- Touch that, and you're dead.
- Relax. It wasn't us.
[Loud Growling, Wailing]
[Trillian]
What the hell happened here?
[Beeps]
- [Computer voice] Please enter your security key card.
- [Hanover] Hey!
- Well, what do you know? Sign of life.
- With curves.
Excuse me. But, this area is for authorized personnel only.
As the assistant to the purser,
I'm afraid I'll have to report you.
- Where are the other passengers?
- I don't know, sleeping.
You tell me what happened here, or I pull the trigger.
- Who are you?
- Passenger. Just a passenger.
Name's Trillian.
And you are?
[Vivo] Thank you.
Makes my Job a lot easier.
- Glad to be of assistance.
- So again, tell me what happened here.
- Where is everybody?
- I thought you liked to blow things up.
[Recording] Good evening. The vault is now open.
- [Vivo] I do.
Yes! Money, money, money.
[Trillian Screaming]
[Hanover] Vivo!
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Stop!
- [Captain] Jesus Christ!
- [Hanover] Son of a bitch!
- No, no, no, no!
- Come on!
Get outta here! Come on, get outta here!
[Canton] I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You just killed one of my best men!
I didn't mean to. I-I-I thought it was one of them! I didn't know.
- Those are innocent people in there!
- [Hanover] Shut up!
Who are you people?
- One of who? What are you talkin' about?
- One of those things!
- Haven't you seen them?
- [Mamooli in Headset]
What's that?
Speak up, Mamooli!
- You're cutting out. Repeat that!
- Yeah, yeah.
Shut up, man. Listen!
I think T. Ray's dead.
Forget about that. We gotta get out of here. There's something down here.
Shut up!
Just shut... the fuck up!
There's nothin' down here but you and me. Hmm?
[Growling, Splashing]
Go on! Get the parts now!
Get the parts! Come on!
[Growling]
What the...
Mamooli! T. Ray!
They're everywhere. You hear me?
We've got to get off this ship.
Al right. Let's check it out.
- What about the vault?
- It'll be here. Grab, Vivo's gun. Let's go!
What the hell was that, Finnegan?
I don't know!
I didn't get a good look!
You get all the parts?
If I don't,
I ain't goin' back to get 'em.

- The door is closing.
- Who the hell are you?
- Who the hell are you?
- I think she broke my nose.
Give me a chance,
I'll break the rest of your face.
- Not that anyone would notice.
- What is this about?
What is it?
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
There's something up there.
Third level. Fourth level.

Please stand clear of the door.

Drop it! [Weapons cocking]
- Now!
- Drop it! Drop it!
Do it.
Where's Mamooli? T. Ray?
- They didn't make it.
- What the hell happened?
He killed them.
You killed them!
- I didn't kill anybody. There's somethin' on this ship.
[Hanover] Bullshit!
No! It's not bullshit, Mr Hanover.
There are things on this ship!
You two know each other.
- Please stand clear of the door.
- T. Ray was my... you killed him,
Didn't you? You killed him,
Didn't you? Didn't you?
[Grunt]
- I heard you the first time.
- Stand down, you!
And you, tell me what happened.
The ship's infested. The bloody thing are everywhere.
- Infested with what?

Never seen anything like it before.

Come on. There's nowhere to hide.
Chick with the muscles?
[Thunder, Lightning Crashing]
[Canton] It was almost as if the ship had struck a reef or something.
It came to a sudden, violent stop.
And then suddenly they were everywhere.
Th-The passengers all panicked.
[Captain] Well that was so fast.
There was no time to do anything.
Couldn't even use the lifeboats.
Trouble is gentlemen, nobody knows we're in trouble. Couldn't send an SOS.
Well, then, mon capitaine. I think the first order of business should be to call for help. Don't you?
- Yeah, man, call in the Marines.
- Yeah, let's do it now.
[Captain] Look, you don't seem to understand.
- Something has jammed the systems.
- Not something.
Someone.
Who are you?
My name is Simon Canton.
I own this ship.
Hanover had a connection on this ship, somebody to knock out all the communications.
You two know each other.
- It was you.
- What?
Very quick, Mr Finnegan.
- Is this true, Canton?
- [Finnegan] How do we fix it?
[Gun cocking]
I said, how do we fix it?
Answer him.
Answer him, you son of a bitch!
[Muttering]
All the systems are melted at the core.
There's not going to be any calls for help.
[Gasping]
- For God's sake, man, why?
- Damn it!
This was supposed to be your life's work, I thought.
Ships gotta be worth, what?
Couple of hundred million.
Four hundred eighty-seven point six million dollars.
The insurance.
That's what the torpedoes are for.
You loot the ship, and then you sink it for the insurance.
I spent my whole life, my entire fortune, building this ship.
I'll be damned if I'm gonna lose it to a bunch of pencil-necked bankers.
Lose it! You greedy bastard.
What are you talking about?
The ship was up and running at full capacity.
I know captain. But, the problem is, the cost of keeping it operating is a hell of a lot more than we're ever gonna take in.
You mean, we're all gonna die because you screwed up on the math?
I simply misjudged the market.
What about the passengers?
Were they insured?
I may be a crook, but I'm not a savage.
The passengers, the crew and I would have been safely evacuated on the lifeboats.
Don't you get self-righteous with me,
Mr. Finnegan. I know all about you.
You despicable, lousy bastard!
[Grunting]
- You sold us out to the bloody insurance!
- All right, knock it off!
Do you realize how many innocent people you've killed on this ship?
- Hey, hey, break this up!
- Innocent passengers!
- [Hanover] That's enough!
- [Canton] Nobody was gonna get hurt!
- What?
- I like it.
Thanks.

So, um... you got a boat waiting outside. Is that right?

You get me to your boat, and, uh...
And I can have whatever I want.
Yeah, whatever you want.

Come on! Pull!
[Captain Screaming]

Eat this, you wankers!
[Wailing Recedes]
What the hell are these god-damned things?
I'm beginning to fear that our friends here... maybe... some kind of strange Archaea Ottoia family.
[Pantucci] Huh, the Ottoia family.
And to think, I was starting to worry.
At 4,000 feet...
The Ottoia are about as long as a pencil... with bodies about the size of a golf ball.
But those at 20,000 feet... have been found to eat full-grown sharks.
At thirty or forty thousand feet... well, you do the math.
This, uh... this is not good.
Are we talkin' some kind of mutated sea monsters here?
Who gives a shit what they are?
Just tell us how to kill these, mother fuckers.
The Ottoia are very crafty.
[Canton]
They hide in burrows... and catch their victims with spiny tentacles, and then they-they crush them between massive jaws.
Yeah, and then they eat you, right?
No. They drink you.
They drink you alive, sucking all the fluids out of a body before excreting the skeletal remains.
All right. That's it, lessons over. Here's the plan.
Hey! I'm still givin' the orders around here, mister!
You stay here and give all the orders you want.
I'm gettin' back up to my boat, cuttin' it loose and gettin' the hell outta here.
Yeah, man.
I second that motion.
- Mind if I tag a long?
- Feel free.
[Finnegan]
Which way now?
At the end of this passageway, there should be an under-pass on the port side...
- that'll take us to the upper levels.
- The starboard.
I've got the blue prints to the entire ship right here.
Who do you think gave you those blueprints?
I ask you, man, could it get any worse?
[Power Surging Sound]
[Finnegan]
Thanks, Joey.
I can't get that song out of my head.
They must have ripped a hole right through the hull. That's how they got in.
The power of these things, it's... it's awesome.
- I'm glad you're so impressed.
- Shit!
- There's no way out through this door.
- It's buckled right to the frame.
- We can't go back the way we came.
- Okay, Canton, it's your ship.
Any ideas?
There are more hatchways and stairwells on the other side of this wall.
The only way out of here, is down those steps.
[Beeps]
- He's right.
- How far?
[Beeps]
[Sighs] It's 20 meters.
Somebody's gonna have to go down there and check.
I volunteer to wait here.
- Me too.
- No way.
I'll go.
But you're comin' with me.
- Good luck.
- And what are we laughing at?
If we make it through,
I'll fire two rounds.
That means it's safe to come on through. Okay?
Okay.
Hey! It's mine.
Let's give the lady a real gun, shall we?
You know how to use that?
Yeah. If something comes at me, I'll just pull the trigger till it goes away.
Careful with that.
It's got a hell of a kick.
I can handle it.
Well, if we're going for a swim...
I think it's your turn to carry the parts.
This is turnin' out to be one hell of a day.
[Gasping, choking]
- Come on.
- Up.
What the hell is taking them?
You know, a... I don't mean to sound like a pussy... but, this shit is starting to freak me out, man.
[Pantucci]
Can you just get asthma?
Or do you have to be born with it?
[Gasps]
[Thundering Explosion]
Uh-oh.
Oh, my God!
[Roaring]
[Wailing, Pounding]
Jump!
Fuck!
[Wailing]
[Panting]
[Pounding]
[Wailing]
Come on, you son of a bitch!
Come on! Come on!
[Gun Rattling,
Pantucci Panting]
[Roaring]
[Screaming]
[Yelling, shrieking]
Oh! Aah! I'm outta here!
I'm outta here!
[Wailing]
[Screaming]
[Screaming]
[Moaning, Shrieking]
[Beeping]
[Gasping]
Come on, buddy.
There you go.
[Gasping]
- Where's Mason?
- It got him.
- Shit! Not Mason!
- Grabbed him.
[Mulligan]
No way this is happening!
This isn't bloody happening!
- Who's next.
- Now, where do we go?
There are more elevators through that hatchway over there.
Fuck elevators.
I ain't goin' up in no more elevators, man.
I agree with these gentlemen.
How much longer before we can expect a rescue?
I'm not waitin' on any rescue party, Finnegan.
We checked in Just before sunset.
It'll be another 24 hours before they start searching for us.
Wh... what Are you saying they're not even gonna start looking for this ship for another day or two?
Yeah, a... bit late by then, folks.
We got creepy crawlies swarming all over the place killing us off left and right.
Makes for a bit of a tight jam, don't you think?
I say we stay right here!
- Are you insane?
- No. No, man. He's right.
There's plenty of food here.
We can hold out until they rescue us.
They're right. This is the galley for the crew.
It was built to be almost entirely airtight in case of fire.
With these hatches closed, there's no way those things can get in here.
You wanna wind up in jail, Mulligan?
Better that, than in the belly of one of those things.
I don't care what you do, but I'm gonna keep on goin'. It's our only chance.
Back off! They are wiping us out, one at a time.
I say we make a stand.
Right here, right now.
The whole damn ship's infested, Finnegan.
We're not gonna make it back to the boat anyway.
I'm not stayin' down here, and that's a fact.
- Now, back off that hatch.
- I'll do it.
I'll do it. I swear to God, I'll kill you.
- I'm not mucking about here.
- Whoa, whoa.
- Don't get hasty, man.
- We're not staying here, Mulligan!
I say we are!
[Weapons cocking]
Last stand, hey? We'll kick ass and take names.
You back off right now, soldier... before I put you down.
[Finnegan] I once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle... and then he corked it and sealed it tight... and threw it to a baby octopus.
Now, the octopus, he felt his way all around that bottle... and in less than two minutes, he got the cork off, slid inside... and ate the fish.
And the moral of this story is?
We're the fish.
[Trillian]
Listen... the ship's already starting to sink.
What if they don't get here in time?
- I-I don't want to drown.
- Yeah.
Look, Mulligan, you can do whatever you want, but I am gonna get my ass to the surface, pray to God that my boat is still there... and those things aren't crawlin' all over it... and then I am gonna bail the hell outta here.
[Panting]
What?
What?
What are you looking at?
[Yelling]
[Rapid Gunfire]
[Roaring]
[Shrieking]
[Chuckles]
You want some?
You're nothin'!
[Panting]
[Roaring]
[Growling] [Gasping]
You see that?
Did you see that?
[Canton Whimpering]
[Hanover] Shit!
They're closin' the damn hatches, man!
They're closin' the hatches!
[Growling]
[Trillian Shrieking]
[Electrical Shorting Sound]
They're herding us!
They're forcin' us to go where they want us to go.
Wait, wait. Now you're tellin' me these things can think?
They're pushing us toward the bow of the ship.
What the hell is at the bow of the ship?
- Which way.
- This just takes us back into the holes.
That's the way up, through there.
[Panting]
- Are you comin', or what?
- Yeah.
I'm right behind you, really.
[Panting]
[Steam hissing]
What the hell is this?
Looks like some kind of feeding ground.
Looks like a dead end to me.
Where's Canton?
[Metallic Groaning]
[Groaning Intensifies]
Now what?
[Growling]
Oh, my God. They're breaking through the hull.
[Roaring] [Splashing water]
Go! Go! Go!
Everybody out.
Go, go, go.
What is this?
[Finnegan] Canton!
Open up, Canton!
Open up, you bastard.
Open the door!
[Screaming]
[Wailing]
Do you hear that?
They're comin', man!
They're comin'!
[Screams] [Grunts]
- Son of a bitch!
- I'm sorry!
Where's my gun?
Where's my gun?
[Water Gurgling]
Hey, give me one of those!
[Grunts]
You idiot!
[Beeping]
Well, you didn't tell me to do that.
[Water Splashes]
You didn't tell me to do that.
[Growling]
[Screaming]
- Son of a bitch!
- Hey!
No, no, no, no! What are you doing? Come on!
I lost the backpack! It's got the engine parts to my boat!
We're not goin' anywhere without 'em!
Damn!
[Water Rushing]
Oh, shit.
[Trillian Gasps]
They're catchin' up!
They're catchin' up! We gotta slow them down.
The only way to slow them down, is to feed them.
Feed them!
All I got is a wet stick of gum and a breath mint!
Okay! All right!
What do we feed 'em?
What are we gonna feed 'em?
[Gunshot]
[Screaming]
[Roaring]
[Gasps] Oh, my God!
It's gonna sink!
[Chuckles]
It's going to sink.
[Thunder crashes]
An island!
Hey! Hey, did you see that?
Yeah, I see it! We gotta get to it! Come on!
- That heap of junk is your boat?
- You got a better one?
[Laughing]
Wait a minute.
What if those god-damn things are crawling inside it?
We'll have to take our chances!
Can your boat make it to that island, without the engine parts?
Not a chance in hell.
Then what are we doing?
Trust me!
I got a plan!
[Electrical Buzzing]
[Gasping, groaning]
[Panting]
[Screams]
[Grunting]
[Snarling]
Don't say I never gave you nothin'.
You asshole!
[Growling]
[Trigger clicks]
[Growling]
[Screaming]
- And find the keys!
- Yeah! Yeah!
Make sure it's got gas.
[Thunder crashes]
[Grunts]
Okay, okay.
The key's gotta be around here somewhere.
[Beeping]
[Crashing Sound]
Did you miss me?
Quit screwing around!
Get to the engine room and get me any power you can, fast.
Not even a, "Joey,
I'm glad to see you?"
"Joey, what happened to your leg"?
Joey, you wanna be the appetizer or the entrée?
Right, right, right.
I'm on it.
Give me the parts.
[Mutters]
I lost them...
[Pantucci mocks muttering]
I lost 'em!
- You what?
- I lost 'em, okay? I lost 'em!
Go with the flow will you, Joey? I got a plan.
Plan my ass! Without those parts, this thing ain't gonna go more than about a city block!
Well, that's all I'm gonna need.
Now get movin', will you?
Leila?
I don't think she made it.
Right.
I'll, uh... I'll go see what I can do.
[Beeping]
[Beeping]
And kaboom.
- That ought to do it.
- All set.
But, we only got enough fuel for maybe 5, 6 minutes max.
Then she's runnin' on fumes.
Here goes nothing.
Come on! Come on! Come on!
[Engine sputters]
Come on! Come on! Come on!
[Panting]
Yes! Yes! Yes! Come on baby.
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
[Engine sputters]
Damn!
- Listen, you have to be...
- Gentle. I know! I know!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
- Yes!
- Atta girl.
[Engine idling]
Bye-bye, baby.
Come on, man. Let's book.
Hello.
[Gasps]
Shit!
I'll bet. It's nice to see you again too.
Ah-ha-ha! No!
Now, give me that key.
[Thunder crashes]
- I'll... I'll take you with me.
- Yeah, what about the others?
Fuck 'em. They have to go down with the ship. That's how it works.
Now, give me that key.
Now!
Give me that key.
[Grunts]
[Shouts]
[Trillian Screams]
Son of a bitch!
Get in there and cut the engines.
Wait! Wait!
Are you crazy?
Just cut the engines, Tucc!
Do it now!
Wait! Wait!
Shit!
Give me that key, you bitch!
[Grunts]
God-damn it!
[Screams]
[Panting]
I've never actually killed anybody before.
[Scoffs]
Not on purpose that is.
Here. Take this.
Now... just, walk away and let me go.
[Chuckles]
I don't think so.
No witnesses allowed.
I don't think this'll be quick, but... it'll be interesting.
No! No!
[Shooting resumes]

Oh, now what?
[Metallic creaking]
[Hysterical wailing]
[Roaring]

Now there's somethin' you don't see every day.

Finnegan!
Aah!
[Grunting]
[Growling, roaring]
What are you lookin' at?
[Weapon unsheathing]
[Shrieking]
[Grunting]
Look out!
[Weapon cocking]
Get to the cargo bay!
Go! Go!
[Roaring]
Pantucci! Come on!
Let's get the hell outta here...
[Shrieking resumes]
[Gasps]
God. Finnegan, where are you?
[Thunder crashing]
[Screams]
Jesus, lady. Watch it will ya!
Shit. I'm sorry.
Thank God you're alive.
Damn straight I am.
Let's keep it that way, huh?
[Thunder rumbling]
[Engine idling]
[Canton chuckles]
No!
[Canton screams]
[Moaning]
[Groaning continues]
Well, that's a hell of a Jump.
Let's get up some speed.
Hang on.
Whoa!
Oh, shit!
Go, Finnegan!
Faster! Faster!
[Roaring, snarling]
Cock it!
[Shrieking]
[Grunting]
[Beeping]
[Beeping continues]
[Canton groaning]

[Finnegan grunting]
We gotta get outta here!
This thing's gonna blow!
Whoa!

Oh shit!
Cock it!
[Cocking]

[Both cheer]
Whoo-hoo!
[Groaning]
[Beeping]
[Beeping]
[Grunts]
[Rapid beeping]
[Panicked groaning]
Hang on!
[Shrieking]
Shot to shit.
Where are you when I need you, Joey?
Hey, I found a souvenir.
Well, I guess we're stuck on this island.
[Surf crashing]
Well, I guess we're stuck on this island.
Better than a cold beer, huh?
Finnegan!
Hey, guys!
Joey!
- Joey!
- Are you all right?
Watch the leg!
Watch the leg!
- Watch the leg!
- I thought you said he was dead.
I thought he was dead!
It... It almost had me, man.
It came crashin' right through the wind-shield.
I ran out the hatch.
The thing was snappin' at my ass.
[Pantucci gasps]
I dove overboard, swam like hell.
Next thing I know, kabloowie.
And your damn surfboard almost cut me in half, man.
[Laughing]
Hey, was it the water in my eyes, or... did I just see a little lip action between you two?
Joey...
You know, I could always go for a stroll down the beach or...
- Joey.
- Go for a little swim.
Although, I gotta tell ya, if I never get back in that damn water...
[Both]
Joey!
Okay, cool. I'll stick around.
You don't have to beg me.
This looks like a... nice enough place.
[Beastly roaring]
[Snarling]
[Roaring continues]
[Finnegan]
Now what?
I've got the vibes.
This thing is evil, man.
I got a bad feeling.
Shut up and keep moving.
Is big mistake.
Let it go, man. We set it down, and we let it go.
It's only a bloody monkey, for Christ's sake. Now pick it up.
Listen, you no pick up the cage, you no get the big dollars.
Holy shit!
Don't move!
What are these buggers playing at?
He says the Rat Monkey must be set free.
He says we must leave this valley and never return, or the evil spirits will exact their revenge.
Permit. Look and see. Permit.
Permit!
I'm a New Zealand zoo official, and this monkey is going to Newtown.
Move it!
Start her up! Quick!
Hey!
Drive, you buggers!
Man, wait.
Step on it!
Ow!
The little bugger bit me.
Zingaya! Zingaya!
You've got the bite.
There's some Dettol in the jeep.
Jeez! No!
No! What are you doing?
Zingaya.
Shit!
- Zingaya!
- Zingaya!
Thank you.
- Hi, Paquita.
- Good morning, Roger.
That's the lot.
Tell your dad I'll be round on
Thursday with the saveloys.
That's a pretty dress, Paquita.
See you later, alligator.
You like that boy, Paquita?
Shuffle the cards.
We will see if you and Roger are destined to be together.
Create his image in your mind and cut the cards.
Paquita,
I thought we'd seen the last of this.
And here you go, you start over again.
This is you.
And this is the man of your future.
- But he doesn't look like Roger.
- It is not Roger.
There will be one romance, and it shall last forever.
Romance?
What about money?
This man will enter your life in the near future.
And you will become romantically entangled with him.
- Almost immediately.
- But who is it?
You will recognize this man by the symbol of the star and of the moon.
- What is this?
- No, not that one.
Paquita, we have a customer.
- It's bad, yes?
- Nothing.
Paquita!
Just dropping off our order.
Um...
Mum says to pack the biscuits on top because she doesn't want any broken.
Uh... Actually,
I'll take one of these now.
Sorry.
Santa Maria.
I better be off then.
Lionel!
Lionel!
Good morning, everybody.
Morning, everybody.
Well, now I'd like...
There's a beetle.
Eh?
There. Under the fridge.
Horrid little creature scuttled right in front of me.
I thought I told you to spray this house!
The place is infested with vermin.
I'll get on it straight away, Mum.
Lionel!
You'll be pleased to know that your mother has been voted treasurer elect of the WLWL.
The Wellington Ladies'
Welfare League.
That's great, Mum.
And on Friday, the president, Nora Matheson, is dropping by to offer her congratulations.
Wow, the president.
Oh, God!
Look at the state of this place!
All the windows will have to be polished.
Look at this dust!
It's an inch thick!
- You'll have to do the silver.
- I polished it last week.
And the drapes need cleaning.
- Oh!
- I just mowed the lawn.
Does this look like a well-maintained frontage?
Get off, you stupid dog.
Here, I'll help you.
No. I manage.
Your brother usually does the deliveries.
Not today.
Oh... Is big house.
You live here always?
Yeah.
You like my dog?
Is very big, yes?
Any bigger, and he'd belong in a zoo.
Zoo? Pardon?
Zoo. You know, animals? Cages?
Ah. Claro.
I like to go with zoo.
I go with the zoo?
No. No, no.
You want to go to the zoo.
Yes, please.
Oh.
Okay.
Tomorrow?
I'll meet you outside the shop.
Okay.
I have to go.
My jardinière, it's shattered.
Mum, that was your favorite.
It would never have happened if you'd taken more care with the dusting.
- I can get you another one.
- It's irreplaceable.
A present from your father.
Our last wedding anniversary.
Before he was taken from us.
I miss him, too.
Oh. Look.
Cary Grant. He is such a dream.
I wish I could be Grace Kelly.
She is so pretty.
Such beautiful blonde hair.
Lionel?
What is wrong?
Sorry.
Um...
When I was young, I was at the beach, and I...
I nearly drowned when
I fell off this pier.
My dad dived in to save me, but as he was climbing out, this freak wave just washed him out to sea and he drowned.
Oh! The little monkeys!
Look, Lionel.
- Oh!
- Oh!
There! For you!
Poor little bugger.
Get out of there, you vicious little shit!
Reckon they're only found on one island, you know?
Story goes, these great big rats come scuttling off the slave ships and raped all the little tree monkeys.
You know, the natives use them in black magic rituals.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Don't ask me how.
Probably suck the blood of virgins, eh?
I want to sit down.
Wow.
Hmm.
Oh!
Mum?
Mum!
Holy shit!
Look at this. It bit me.
I've been savaged.
And my dress.
Here, I help you.
Lionel.
Take me home.
There you are, Vera.
Now, you just rest up.
I'll be back in a couple of days to change that dressing.
Thanks, Nurse McTavish.
It's all right, Lionel.
I'll see myself out.
Why have you deliberately gone out of your way to upset me?
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.
I don't deserve all this attention, darling.
If you need anything during the night,
- you just call.
- You're so good to me.
Good night, Mum.
Lionel!
Hello!
Shh!
Keep your voice down.
- Look, I have your jacket.
- Yeah. I'll get it tomorrow.
What?
Look.
- It could've waited till the morning.
- Is that all you have to say?
Look, I'm really sorry about the zoo, Paquita.
It's just Mum, she's...
You know.
We go out again? To a movie?
Look.
I'd like to.
But it's not...
It's just not possible.
Not possible?
But we are romantically entangled.
Entangled? Look...
Look, I don't know what you're thinking, but I just can't see you anymore.
Paquita.
There will be one romance, and it shall last forever.
Wow! Mum, what a beautiful day.
Oh!
I'm gonna call Nurse McTavish.
No. You'll do no such thing.
- I'm perfectly all right.
- But...
You'll look after me, Lionel.
Nora Matheson. Ladies'
Welfare League.
Your mother's expecting us.
The Mathesons are here.
No, Mum. You're not well!
Get my dress!
Oh.
Jeez!
Please go back to bed, Mum.
I'll put them off. It's only the Mathesons.
It's the WLWL!
Careful. It'll stick on crooked.
Our main objective next year is to try to get some of the younger generation involved in the league.
That's why I'm so pleased that you're on the committee, Vera.
Thank you, Nora.
It's a great honor.
Have you had any thoughts on the agenda for the annual meeting?
Annual meeting.
Annual meeting.
What we need's another war!
Yes, dear.
I hear Sir Edmund Hillary's planning an attempt on the South Pole.
By trek, though.
Have some more beans,
Mrs. Matheson.
I'll have a few of those, lad.
I really think we should be going, dear.
Thank you, Lionel.
What?
No pudding?
Only custard, I'm afraid.
Custard.
I haven't had a good custard in years.
She never makes the stuff.
Damn fine custard.
Rich and creamy, just the way I like it.
Touchy on the old food front.
Never mind.
That was a fine meal, boy.
Thank you, Mr. Matheson.
- Lionel!
- What's wrong?
Lionel, you must listen to me.
Dark forces are amassing against you.
My grandmamma has seen it.
"The path ahead is one of fear and great danger."
Fernando!
Paquita, wait!
God! Mum!
Oh, Fernando.
Your mother ate my dog!
Not all of it.
Get Nurse McTavish, quick.
How long has your mother been like this?
Since this morning.
Oh... Um...
I'll call an ambulance. You pack some things for the hospital.
I'll do it.
Nurse McTavish.
Your mother's dead, Lionel.
I'm sorry, Lionel.
There was nothing we could do.
She loved you very much.
Which toothbrush?
Lionel!
Your mother's toothbrush, the white one or green one?
Green!
Mother, you are looking well today.
I woke up this morning, Phillip, and I feel 100% better.
How about a nice cup of tea?
I'll just put the jug on.
Sorry, Mother. That was your favorite teapot.
It slipped out of me hand.
Never mind, Phillip.
Bed jacket, nightgown, slippers and toothbrush.
Where's your mother?
- She's gone to hospital.
- Oh.
I didn't hear the ambulance.
No, no, no.
Um...
Well, uh, she went in Nurse
McTavish's car, yeah.
Sort of...
Well, sort of... Sort of lying across the back seat, really.
Yeah. Her and Nurse
McTavish off to hospital.
But her night bag?
I'll take that.
So, it's you who's been poaching my rabbits.
- Lionel.
- I've a good mind to let you have it
with both barrels.
It weren't me, sir.
It were that Johnny
Morris what did it.
Well, I go now.
You just be on your way, young lad.
If I see you here again,
I'll give you what for.
What do you want?
You're not from the Immigration?
I told you people I lost my bloody papers, okay?
My family left Latvia during the occupation.
We were hunted like dogs!
I just want to buy some sedatives.
What do you think I am?
A goddamn doctor?
I don't sell sedatives.
Tranquilizers, I do have.
Do you want a syringe, or are you going to sniff?
Lionel, I am happy to see you.
Tell me about these dark forces.
Death surrounds him.
There will be torment and suffering.
You are marked.
Lionel.
Lionel, if something is wrong, I can...
Nothing's wrong, okay?
It contains the power of the white light.
It will protect you.
Keep it with you always.
How is your mother?
Fine.
Yeah, they want to keep her in hospital for a few more days.
I didn't see her. She ran right in front of me.
They must have discharged her early.
It was a dreadful shock, losing Vera like that.
Had lunch with her only last Friday. Picture of health.
- That boy of hers, where is he?
- Fine lad.
Lionel called half a dozen times in the last two days, very keen to view the remains.
Of course I had to put him off.
It would have been far too distressing.
As it is, it's been a damn difficult embalming job.
Oh, my God. Excuse me.
I can tell you're not a Cosgrove.
- You're far too good looking.
- Pardon?
Les is the name. I'm Lionel's...
Lionel's uncle.
And who might you be?
Paquita Maria Sanchez.
Latin, eh?
Excuse me, Father.
- I am looking for Lionel.
- I haven't seen him.
And if he's not here in 10 minutes, his mother will be delivered into the hands of the Lord in his absence.
You idiot.
I told you to stay in there.
The embalming machine should've been turned off half an hour ago.
Great! The old blowout!
You're a half-wit.
This is coming off your wages.
- I'll fix them up.
- No, leave it.
We've got to get the body to the service.
The theme of today's service is the sanctity of motherhood.
Vera Cosgrove will be surely missed by her friends and grieving family, for she was indeed a fine woman,
and everything a boy could wish for in a mother.
Lionel, though deprived of his father at an early age, was blessed with an abundance of mother love.
Though our dear ones depart, they live on in our hearts and memories.
Until, in the fullness of time, we, too, depart from this world.
Until we are reunited once again.
A Christian spirit is eternal.
Yea, whosoever believeth in the Lord, Jesus Christ, shall be resurrected.
Poor Lionel.
He was always dreadfully attached to his mother.
Well, I've seen some displays of grief in my day, but nothing quite like that.
Do you need anything?
I'm fine.
I called to see you yesterday, but you didn't answer the door.
I just want to be left alone for a while, okay?
At least he's well provided for.
Yes, well, the Cosgroves were hardly paupers.
He'll be the sole beneficiary.
Hey, guys.
Look what I found.
What are you doing with this thing?
Digging up a few stiffs?
- I...
- Shut up!
You know what you are?
A bloody sicko.
Yeah, mental.
Get his wallet.
That's my mother you're pissing on.
It's a zombie!
Mom! No!
What in God's name is going on here?
The devil is amongst us.
Stay back, boy.
This calls for divine intervention.
I kick ass for the Lord!
No!
There you are, Mum.
Void.
Use the spoon.
Hey, hey.
Cut that out.
Shh!
How's it going, Lionel?
Come on, mate.
I'm dying for a slash.
I've got a urinary infection.
Christ, what a stink!
Yeah. Dog must have crawled under the house and died.
Can't have been easy for you these past few weeks, Lionel, what with your mother gone.
Oh!
Who's that little girl you've been seeing?
What?
You know, the little Latin number with a cute bum.
Paquita.
Yeah. Paquita.
That's the one.
She's a bit of all right.
Wouldn't mind her doing the growl on me.
So, all this is coming your way?
Of course, your mother was always intending to leave me a bequest.
- Oh?
- Yes. We talked about it many times.
It was a foregone conclusion, really.
It's just, with her dying suddenly, she didn't get the chance to include me in her will.
Well, you'll have to talk to the lawyers about that, Uncle Les.
Don't bring the bloody lawyers into it.
This is a private family matter.
What the hell's that?
It's the pipes.
They do that sometimes.
It's not the pipes, Lionel.
It's somebody doing the business.
Please, Uncle Les, you just got to leave.
So you found your dad's old stag movies?
Is that the one with the donkey and the chambermaid?
No, please.
All right. I understand, Lionel.
Some things a man prefers to do on his own.
It's all part of the grieving process.
I'll be seeing you, Lionel.
Nijinsky was of what nationality?
Nijinsky was Russian.
Russian is right. That's very...
Lionel!
I dropped a shilling. It must have rolled down the drain.
I come to see you, you shut the door in my face.
You built a big wall. I telephone, and you don't answer.
Why?
Speak to me.
You don't want to see me anymore?
It was a mistake.
Sorry.
Goodbye.
- Paquita.
- Leave me alone.
- I'm sorry.
- Leave me alone.
Take your hands off her, you creep!
You know what they're saying about you, don't you?
You've gone funny in the head.
A real bloody weirdo.
You touch her again, and I'll knock you into the middle of next week.
Come on, Paquita.
Cute little guy.
Hello. Hello.
Who's a cutie?
Who's a cute little Selwyn here?
Oh!
Peek-a-boo. Peek-a-boo.
So I said...
Yeah!
Hyperactive.
So, I tackled this guy, right?
I brought him down with this real bone cruncher.
And the ball rolls free, so I scooped it up, and you know what I did?
I drop kicked from 50 yards out.
God, you should have seen it.
Put us three points ahead, gave us the match.
Fantastic.
Hello, Lionel.
That's quite a collection of stiffs you got down there.
And I thought you were such a quiet chappie.
Uncle Les, they're not what you think.
Back off, mate!
Lay a hand on me,
I'll have you for breakfast.
I'm sorry, Lionel.
If I don't report this, I'll be an accessory after the fact.
I hope they can keep it out of the papers for your mother's sake.
She always hated a scandal.
This is hard for me, Lionel, informing on me sister's boy and all.
Of course if I was to keep me mouth shut, I'd be taking a hell of a risk.
Hey, put me through to the police, please.
Of course if I was to get my fair share of Vera's estate,
I might be more inclined to protect a member of the family.
You want the money?
Detective Sergeant Bauer, I'd like to report a multiple murder.
Yes, I'll wait.
The money and the house.
Blood is thicker than water, Lionel.
Yeah, good day. Les about?
Barry, you bastard!
Thought we'd pop over and take a squish at your new digs.
Yeah, mate. Why not?
- Rip the skins off a few brown ones.
- Yeah. We'll make a night of it.
- Where are you going?
- Just for a walk.
No, mate. These people want a feast. We'll get a party going.
We'll just get some savories for you, mate.
Have you gotten rid of those stiffs yet?
Hey, Les, let's stick some real music on.
Yeah. Coming through.
Better clear the dance floor.
I don't know what sort of kinky shit you're into, but I want those things buried.
Come on, baby, let's dance!
It's no good asking Lionel.
He's nothing like his old man.
He was a real stick man.
Used to pull the birds like you wouldn't believe.
Don't talk about my father like that.
Tasty.
You got anything else that I can nibble on?
So, you know, I throw him a dummy, fooled him completely.
Now, you got to imagine, this is, like...
This is, like, 10, 15 yards out from the sideline.
There are several of these big buggers coming towards me, right?
So what do I do? I... I...
I put my head down, and I shocked again. I touched down right between the posts. God.
You know, the coach reckons
I'm a dead certain for the next All Blacks trials.
What do you think about that, Paquita?
You could be going out with the next Bob Scott.
Oh!
What have we here!
A cute little signorina, right?
- Let go of me!
- Come on, now. Don't be a party pooper.
Come and have a drink.
I bet you go off like a rocket.
Oh!
You little bitch! I'll get you!
Where did she go?
You foreign bitch! I'll get you!
Hello?
Hello?
Paquita!
Paquita.
"Death surrounds him."
They're not dead exactly.
They're just sort of rotting.
Nurse McTavish.
Father McGruder.
Your mother!
I don't know what to do, you know? I...
I don't know how to stop it.
You must destroy them.
I... I can't.
Not Mum.
That thing is not your mother.
Come on, Les, join in.
I'll do it.
What's this?
Two lovebirds flying the coop, is it?
- Out of the way, Uncle Les!
- You're not going anywhere, mate, until the house papers come through.
Come on, Lionel.
No, you don't!
Oh!
- Ahhh!
- Ahhh!
Come on!
You fiery, little bitch.
It's time you and I got better acquainted.
Oh!
Help! Someone! Please!
For God's sake, run!
Not so loud, mate!
- Bastardo!
- Bitch!
Madre de Dios!
- Help us!
- Bugger that!
Run, Paquita!
Help!
Help! Help! Help!
Shit!
Help! Help!
Please don't kill me.
It's okay. It's me.
That's a nasty plaque problem you got there, mate.
Got a bit of a cavity there, mate.
Mandy.
It's me, Rita.
Remember?
Oh!
You mutant little shit!
You'll be okay.
Let me in! For Christ's sake, let me in!
Let me in! Help!
Please, help!
Paquita, we must.
Come on! Help! Quickly!
There's thousands of them!
What the hell's this?
Leave her alone.
She's been bitten! You know what that means?
She's gonna turn into one of them!
I won't. I won't.
Help me!
- Stop it!
- You stay out of it!
I know what to do! She's history!
I've read the comics!
Total lobotomy!
- Dismemberment!
- You're crazy!
There's no room for hysterical women in my unit!
Step right up, you creepy old bastards!
Lionel.
Paquita!
No!
Just as well someone around here's got balls, eh, girls?
You goddamn little rug rat!
Get out of the way!
You little maggot!
Where are you, you little crawler?
No!
Lionel!
Holy Christ! Vera!
Leave me.
Party's over.
Rita?
God! No!
No! You just get out of here.
What?
Haven't seen Mum yet.
Come to Mummy, Lionel.
Come on!
No!
You don't scare me, Mum.
All my life, you told me nothing but lies.
That stuff about Dad, none of that was true!
You drowned them both, Mum.
Dad and that blonde woman.
You caught them together and you killed them, didn't you?
How dare you speak to me like that.
Didn't you?
Lionel Here! Quick!
Slut!
Don't you touch her.
No!
No one will ever love you like your mother.
No!
No!
No!
No! No!
Such a good boy.
No.
No!
No.
Oh, it's all yours.
This is out of my league.
Relax, Chief.
We'll take it from here.
No! Aahh!
There he is...
The ultimate soldier.
No mercy, no pity.
No fear.
Oh yeah.
Save it.
They'll glitch, then overload and shut down.
Help me!
Happens every time.
Everything's under control, Dixon.
Out of sight, and completely out of mind, do you get my meaning?
I understand completely, sir.
Needs of national security.
That's good, Dixon.
That's very good.
You've done a great job.
Just make sure that nobody saw nothin'.
National security.
Thank you, ma'am.
He was pounding the wall like a road jig or something,
just... over and over again, like a-an automatic, and just--
Are you trying to tell us that this was a man?
- A human being?
- Oh, definitely.
A man machine!
The new reports add weight to the accusations
leveled at the Chaank
Armaments Corporation,
by a growing alliance of humanist organizations,
who insist that
Chaank is, quote:
The original allegations arose after the horrific death
of Joint Chief Executive
Bob Nicholson,
currently unexplained.
And tonight are still fueling demonstrations
outside Chaank's downtown facility.
Chaank kills children!
Chaank kills children!
Chaank kills children!
Chaank kills children!
Wait!
Wait!
Miss Cale, can we have a statement?
I understand the deep, emotional reactions to allegations of illegal projects.
But I assure you, a full public disclosure will be made by this corporation.
And all your questions will be answered.
Earlier today, a Chaank spokesman said he believed
that new Joint Chief Executive
Hayden Cale's impressive reputation
would bring an end to the public disquiet.
Miss Cale, are you aware that under the '94 FOI revision all new exoctic projects must be disclosed to congress?
Of course she is aware!
Chaank isa responsible corporation with a clear world vision.
As a Chief Executive yourself,
Mr. Ridley. does that vision include systematic law breaking?
We know our maxim:
Hard technology for a hard world.
If it wasn't for people like us, you'd all be speaking Russian.
So how did this report get out?
There's a leak somewhere, we tried to stomp on it, but...
Fuck the leak!
Now our alleged involvement made prme time last night.
You gotta can the stations.
Easier said than done with the new syndicators.
Then find the leak, and plug him.
Her.
I'm the leak.
Well, that's stunningly noble, Cale.
But we're not selling hamburgers.
Your behavior on camera and off is not proven conducive to better public relations.
That's a mutual observation, Scott.
And irrelevant.
GSE has imposed me to clean under your carpets, and rest assured,
I suck like an Electrolux.
Incidentally,
I speak Russian.
- I'm gonna sit down now.
- You're a Chief Executive.
Start acting like it.
All right.
One:
This corporation's belligerent stance in it's attempts to surpress the media are breeding rumor and protest.
So I'm sure you'll all agree that a public disclosure would be preferable to an other outburts on the networks or syndicators.
- Two...
- This is a moot discussion anyway.
The Hardman project just doesn't work.
We're recommending a complete shutdown.
- What are you talking about?
- It's fundamentally flawed.
- John.
- Direct cerebral downloading
- generates collateral errors.
- John.
I've explained this to Dante over and over.
- John.
- You know how excitable he gets.
- John!
- What! What!
Shut the fuck up.
Did I just hear right?
Am I to understand that those demonstrators outside
- might actually have a point?
- You should understand--
I want every suspect project shut down!
I want all the details on my desk tonight, and I want Dante fired right now.
With respect, Miss Cale, he's an invaluable asset.
He never submits reports, he illegally orders supplies, he's working secretly in Vault Ten, and he's not here now!
I vote we kick him out.
You should understand that you're one of us now.
Are you still itching?
Those monitors take a while to get used to.
Listen, thread carefully around Dante.
- Are you threatening me?
- No.
Read Nicholson's file.
Hi, Hayden. I just spoke with Jack Dante.
He says he'll see you now.
He'll see me?
Great.
Excuse me, which way to Engineering?
Uh...
What are you doing in here?
This is my room.
Well, keep it clean.
Get out of my room.
When I say I wanna see you,
I expect you to come to my office.
- Who are you?
- Hayden Cale.
I run this corporation.
Oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
The boss lady.
Yeah.
Don't I know you?
I want to see what you're doing in Vault Ten.
Entry is rated
Dual Code Access.
You've got to get Ridley to swipe his card the same time as yours.
- So how do you do it?
- I'm smart.
Show me.
What does the number
7796452 mean to you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Dont recognize your own com link number?
How about account ident?
213-95234-C containing
7,852,320 dollars and 27 cents...
...I believe.
How did you get that information?
Same way I got your address,
1011 Century Plaza, same way I could get your door code if I wanted to:
Hacking!
I've got all the best gear right here.
I can find out anything I want.
Stay out of my files.
Oh, well, I think I'm going to find out all about you...
...Miss Cale.
I understand the deep emotional response--
I-I-I understand--
...the deep emotional re--
...deep emotional respo-response--
...to allegations of--
...illegal projects.
Where you been?
Been gettin' provisions.
See, B?
Goods.
All right.
And...
Wang!
Almost forgot.
I got this from Morse today.
Scott Ridley.
Also know as the Rat.
I want you...
...to implant that on your brain.
And of course, the lovely Cale,
Nicholson's replacement.
They are the target.
Whe should have hid right after Nicholson croaked.
But we didn't.
You gotta learn patience.
Now remember these faces.
The core containment can not be opened without their D-Lock sequences.
We just ought to play the Cutter.
- It's 90 minutes max.
- It'll never work.
- Two hours minimum.
- In any case we only use the Cutter if they refuse to spill.
- They won't.
- They will.
And so...
...the weird turned pro.
- We can't just ignore him!
- Watch me.
Fine! Then just give me your card, and I'll deal with Dante.
You can go home and shed your skin!
Fuck you!
Why don't you go back to your ten million dollar apartment and play with your fucking cat, huh?
You're as morally reprehensible as the rest of us.
He could be building anything down there.
Nicholson did what you're doing.
You read the autopsy.
- Shark attack.
- In this fucking building?
He was chewed to death.
His body was covered in synthetic lubricants, and all Dante ever said is he's building the "meanest motherfucking frontline morale destroyer ever".
In his words.
And you wanna keep him busy?
I just wanna stay alive.
I thought this was a responsible corporation.
Christ. Hardly.
Accessing personnel file
0-5-7-0: DANTE, J.
Subject was orphaned just after birth.
Primary education in various state institutions.
A serious source of disruption,
he was transferred to a secure unit at age seven
after killing a fellow student in a mantrap he built himself.
Released into the care of

Three acquittals for sexual assault, homicide and weapons offences.
Judicial psychological reports

Chaank psyche-evaluation.
...reached the conclusion that Jack Dante is a prime example
of accute violent psychosis, allied to extreme technical virtuosity.
Try "HARDCORE".
- Bad guess.
- I want you out!
- I just got here.
- You know what I mean.
But I'm having so much fun!
You know, it's cool here.
There's loads of... stuff!
Except, you know, nobody talks to me, and,
I'm cleverer than anyone, and nobody comes even near me.
Except you.
And I know what you're after.
With weapons like mine, and authorization like yours, we could do some serious damage.
Sounds like a wet dream to me.
I got something
I wanna show you.
That's not it.
Hold on to this for a second, would you?
Ta-daaa!
I just knew I'd seen you someplace before.
I was...
- I was just a kid.
- Oh, come on, admit it!
You are hot.
- Jelly, baby.
- Get out.
God, that turns me on.
Would you like to do it, like really kind of...
...weird?
Right.
Time of the month.
You know, all that stuff is a total mystery to me.
Get some rest.
It's incredibly stupid, the perimiter access says Adam and I still work here.
So much for automated security.
Time for a big burge.
And down.
And mark.
Okay.
Recap time, yeah?
All right, when the bypass is in place, and the facility is vacated, we down the sensing network.
And move in through the northern gate, courtesy...
...of the lock decoder.
Check.
Now once we get inside, we head straight up to the 60th floor,
make our way to the initialization area, and hole up for 0600 hours.
- Bang! Cale and Ridley arrive.
- And we appropriate their swipe cards.
We also extract their
D-Lock sequences!
- But I think that--
- You have got to remember that.
And turn that
1980 shit down.
Core containment is located deep within the foundations of the building, surrounded by 22 medium security vaults.
Now the only viable access is through a deep corridor, negotiating a tech seal, a serious mother of a bulkhead, and finally, the core seal itself.
All courtesy of the swipe cards and the D-Lock sequences.
The containment is the most secure area of the building, protecting Chaank's digital soft spot, a quad matrix of googolplectic memory co-processors and 350 billion in master software bonds!
Aroo! Aroo!
Arooha!
When you must walk, then walk.
Yeah...
Now, when the job is done, we then make a quick exit out.
And hope nobody wants to start a shootout.
Yeah.
John, we gotta do something about the bitch.
She's cut her own throat, her dismissal is already being arranged, what the hell do you expect to do about it tonight?
How the fuck should I know?
You're the creative type; come up with a car accident or something.
- Oh, for chissake.
- John, we got orders of banned hardware from every blockade and embargoed army on the planet.
We are knee deep into brain wiping ex-battle vets.
That situation is being contained.
On a personal level, pertaining directly to you and I, she is gonna piss Dante right off.
The cat is gonna tear shit out of the pigeons!
- We gotta do something about her.
- Don't you do anything about it!
- I'm coming right up there. Don't--
- Fuck you.
Hi, Scott!
Hi.
Just wanted a quick word.
What do you wanna talk about?
Entropy.
You know?
Order into chaos.
Certainty into unpredictability.
Growth into decay.
Sometimes I just like to pile up my bricks so that I can just knock 'em down again, that's the good bit.
Look.
This is order.
Straight. Truly.
Now don't you think that's more interesting?
Frankly, no, it's just a broken pencil.
Oh.
Well, I wanna show you what I made.
Great.
This is a neuro-synaptic remote relay controller.
This button...
...defaults the system to "ON".
Like a dead man's hand, though, you have to hold it in to keep the thing under control.
What thing?
Patience, dude.
So what happens?
Hopefully...
...you die!
What!
The initial test was a success, but I always think it is wise to double check, don't you?
For God's sake, Jack!
Scott!
Be reasonable.
You're planning to slay my sweetie boss?
You did give her your access swiping card.
She stole it!
Oh.
Scott, I'm sorry, I...
I hadn't thought of that.
Here.
Don't you ever call my girlfriend a thief!
Scott.
I'm sorry.
What do you think?
That good, huh?
God, what a kick!
What's it like to feel stark terror?
Order into chaos.
The way of the world.
We've a helluva situation, here.
You've got a helluva situation, you understand me?
Get over here right now.
I'm in level 3PR.
Get here now!
Fuck off.
It's here.
It's Cale.
They really never left.
Change of plan.
Let's go!
So I scanned the whole goddamn building until I found him.
Well, you think it could wait until better times?
It's a little late.
This could wait till morning at least.
- Oh yeah? You think so?
- Yeah. Yeah, I think so.
Geez...
Fire the cleaners.
Yeah.
It's worse than it looks.
What, the cops caught you playing with your Hardman again?
Yeah, that's it, laugh it up,
Miss Chief Executive.
This is your problem.
It's Ridley.
Something did that to him.
Watch this, uh...
I've got the security surveillance tape.
I checked the access record.
Something came out of the vault...
...and did that to him.
Which vault?
Which vault?
Ten.
Give me your card.
What are you gonna do?
What are we gonna do!
Swipe now. Swipe now.
Swipe now.
Hey, dude.
Workin' late?
Yeah.
Watcha doin'?
Oh... budget reports.
You know, boring stuff.
I hate those.
All done.
Did you hear about what happened to Ridley?
No.
He's dead.
I showed him my thing, and it killed him.
- I'm impressed.
- I knew you would be.
Do you know what this means?
No?
It means that you can up me.
We could be the Demoliton Duo forever.
Why don't you get the personell hard disk, and I'll do that now?
Sure.
Which format is it?
I thought you said you were finished.
No.
Bitch!
Bitch!
Bitch!
God, that was stupid!
It was. Ridley's dead,
I'm in charge; you're fired.
I am very disappointed.
Drop it.
Drop the gun.
- Get your ass in there, Ho Ho.
- Who are you guys?
Where's Ridley?
It's a bad time.
- Where's Ridley?
- He's dead!
Tough bananas.
No problem.
The command chain will automatically promote the next in line.
W-well, I d-I don't have my card.
I-I gave it to her!
Lost it.
- Did ya?
- Mm.
What's this, then?
Huh?
Write down your
D-Lock sequences, please.
Sure.
Thank you.
See?
Give me the sequence.
No.
Bring the Cutter.
Did you ever see that movie Scarface?
I know a better way into the containment.
Follow me.
You're awfully keen to be on our team all of a sudden.
That bitch just fired me.
Now go watch.
Hold it!
This isn't taking us to the containment.
Now whatever it is you are doing...
...don't.
- He knows this place inside out.
- He doesn't know everything.
Check your prints. The containment is surrounded by security vaults.
So?
So, don't you think it would be a lot faster to cut through a standard vault door, and 14 feet of concrete, and a nuke proof bulkhead and
2 inches of molybdenic composite?
Nice.
You know what that means?
That means the seal in
Vault Ten has been breached.
Vault Ten contains some kind of death machine.
- And your friends are letting it out.
- Shut up!
Warmonger.
Hey!
Don't worry about him.
Just get this stuff inside.
Christ.
Almost, but not quite.
What's that?
Ah. This? Backup.
I always carry backup.
Why are you wearing those glasses?
Because this is a surprise part-ay!
Suurpriiiise!
But you should have come in fancy dress.
Weyland!
May your spirit rise, man.
It's redemption time.
All I saw, was something big, fast and fucking dangerous.
- Frontline morale destroyer.
- Shut up!
What does Weyland think?
He's dead, man.
It took him out.
I'm sorry, man, I tried to do everything I could.
There was nothing more
I could do.
- I swear to God--
- I've seen what this thing can do!
- Shut the fuck up!
- We have to take him down!
Yutani, you calm down now.
You're out of line.
- Calm down!
- Listen to me! Fuck you!
- You fuckin' idiot!
- Calm the fuck down!
You listen to me!
- Yutani, you're out of line!
- I'm out of line?
Excuse me?
Uhm... Hey.
STOP!
Dudes! Dudette.
I guess that you're all pretty concerned at this point,
but then again, hey...
Who wouldn't be?
Because, uh...
Oh! Wait, folks.
This late breaking news flash just in:
There is a psycho death bot on the loose.
There is, however, a way out.
All it takes is for Cale to agree to...
One:
Reinstate my access.
Two:
Forget everything that's happened here tonight, and three:
Agree to...
...interface with me on a regular basis.
- All you need to do is sign.
- Yeah, sign my ass.
Ooh, God! That's a sharp comeback.
Is that how you reacted when David divorced you?
- What?
- I said:
Is that how you reacted when David divorced you?
What the hell is this?
Fuckin' Oprah Winfrey?
Oprah? John, we are talking quality, here!
We are talking Gerraldo!
Cale?
Miss Cale.
I realize that this is extremely difficult for you,
but how did you feel when your family disowned you?
- In print, no less.
- That's bullshit!
Wrong answer.
The correct answer is:
It's all in the files.
Except...
...why?
Why did they do that to you?
What did you do that was so bad?
That's it, man, we're out of here.
Beta retreat.
Hey, hey! What about us?
Wa-wait, loo-look!
What about you, Ho Ho?
It's your problem, you deal with it.
It's not our problem, we had nothing to do with this!
Nothing! Right, Cale?
Tell him!
Wa-wait, loo-look! What about compassion, huh?
Or human mercy, huh?
Think about it at least, for God's sake!
So tag along, moosehead.
We ain't gonna look out for ya.
- Sure this is the right way?
- Yeah, two more offices. That way.
What are you, a one-man percussion section or something?
Move it.
Engine quiet.
All right, stand back.
Hold it.
A Category One fire alert would close blast doors.
All over the building.
- Make problems for the machine.
- Yeah, and make problems for us.
- Let's do it.
- Does anybody have a match?
- Not me.
- Not me.
Not me. But I do have a thermic detonator.
Isn't that a little archaic?
Hardwire D.C.
Can't be jammed.
Here.
What do you think you are? Stallone?
Shouldn't you put it closer to the detector?
It's a shaped charge.
Straight up.
Move.
What are you carrying around a det for, anyway?
Once we got to the core, we were gonna pile everything right up to into the middle of that vault, and then blow the shit out of it.
- And steal all the money.
- No, we were gonna blow that up, too.
Dead battery.
Another.
Why were you gonna blow up the money?
Strike a blow for humanitarian causes.
Put as many people like you out of business as we can.
People like me? I'm not the armed raid around here.
Neither are we, honey.
- Blanks?
- That's right.
Not a live round between us.
Great!
Terrific!
I'm being protected by the Three Stooges!
- Minus one.
- Hey, fuck you, Ho Ho!
You guessed it.
Humanist Alliance.
We're the good guys.
What's the problem?
- No power.
- Explosion must have ruptured those feeds.
That's it!
Time to change the game plan...
...treehuggers.
Why did you leave that lying around?
You knew Ho Ho was gonna turn out to be the fat, sweaty, desperate psycho!
- You gave him the knife.
- Oh, really mature.
Well, Big Boy has got a gun now.
A real gun.
Real bullets.
And he's not gonna let you play with it.
Come on, kids!
Everybody out.
Suck me.
Listen up, children.
We're all going down the service elevator.
And when going into a deep, dark hole, a smart boy always pushes a couple of canaries ahead of him.
Shall we?
Nothing personal,
You understand.
I hope this, uh... this won't affect our professional relationship.
What'd you do? Huh?
What did you do!
What are you up to, huh?
What'd you do?
- Nothing!
- Nothing? Nothing?
If you're not up to anything, then why aren't we going down?
No!
It's pinned me down!
Hit the button!
Press the button!
Hit the button!
Christ.
- Do we have any more explosives?
- Nada.
Flairs, dets?
Does anybody have a cigarette?
We have nothing.
How ya doin'?
Uhm...
We're gonna need a bandage or something here.
You're the man.
What are you lookng at?
Look...
We didn't expect trouble, you know?
We're just a caring, humane attack squad.
- Well, you got guts.
- You spelling that D-U-M-B?
What is this place?
I don't know.
Give me my card.
- Access denied.
- Come on, I'm Chief Executive.
Access denied.
All right, let me try the old
Ho Ho Execu-card.
Welcome.
Well... so much for job description, huh?
Imagine getting strapped into this.
- Nice shades, huh?
- Yeah.
Cryonics.
They're just kids.
What is going on here?
This is Chaank's weapon of the future.
You take an injured war vet, make sure he's listed MIA, and erase his mind.
Pump up his violent nature and program him with knowledge of every weapon and fighting skill you can think of.
He becomes the ultimate fighting unit.
No mercy. No pity.
No fear.
Man and machine indivisible.
Shame.
I was beginning to like you.
We've completed preliminary cerebral load.
This is the first test of its effectiveness.
C'mon, hit it.
Okay, okay, kay, kay, kay.
Turn it off, t-t-turn it off.
I-I think I know what I did wrong. I think...
This is gonna work!
I said turn the camera off!
I would've stopped this had I known about it.
Yeah, sure,
I believe you.
I didn't know about tihs until now!
Sure!
- What do we do now?
- Call the syndicators!
Call the networks!
911, call now.
I'm on your side.
...and, we got a little bit of a situation happening, uhm...
I'm in, uh, t-the lab here, the covert lab,
and I just found a whole bunch of bodies, and sort of freezer type things.
So let me get this straight.
You say you have proof that the Chaank Corporation is involved in illegal weapons projects?
I mean, I know that sounds far fetched...
But a homicidal maniac monster has got you trapped on the 65th floor!
It's... It's messy.
And, uh--
While you're up there, say hello to Elvis for me, okay?
- We're on our own.
- Hey! I am here.
No you're not! And besides that, you little freak,
- I'm gonna cut your eye out!
- How does he know where we are?
- He doesn't.
- Wrong. You are in the covert lab.
Turning me off won't turn you off.
I me-I mean
"won't turn me off."
Lifesign transmitter.
Emits a local beacon pulse.
It's how he knows where we are.
Yeah, do it.
Give me this one.
Okay.
Let's go.
Ah!
Not so fast, troops.
You still need the password.
One mean mother.
You wanna know what the neatest thing is?
Enhanced Pheromone Tracing.
That's what the keys are.
- What does that mean?
- It keys on fear.
The more afraid you are, the sharper its trace.
Access Amnesia Interface; still a deal in talk.
I wanna talk to Cale alone.
- Okay.
- Yessss!
It's not okay.
Yeah?
Go fax yourself.
Very funny!
How smart are you gonna be when the Warbeast chews your head off?
You wanna live?
You've got to stop being afraid!
How are you gonna manage that, wise guy?
How are you gonna fight being eaten alive?
No problem.
Suit me up.
- I should be doing this.
- Who'd set up the computer?
Look, you broke achievement records at Cal-Tech,
I delievered extra pepperoni.
- How'd you know that?
- Uhnn...
- Why didn't you volunteer?
- I did!
- He pulled rank.
- I get the duty.
Nice.
You sure this process is reversible?
It'll save your personality to disk.
I can load it back any time.
Yeah? You better make it a big disk.
- Ready?
- Ready.
The arrogant dragon will learn to repent, my friend.
Absolutely.
Careful out there.
Oh, wait a minute,
I got something to say.
I'll be back.
I'll keep it close to my heart.
Remain here!
Excecuting combat objective now!
This area is secure!
Okay, we've got two choices here.
One: We hole up here and hope he beats the crap out of it.
No way.
No more hiding.
Or two...
Let's go.
I wanna talk to you.
- What do you wanna talk about.
- Parallel processing.
Two units interfacing simultaneously, with a high degree of systemic compatibility.
There's a suspicion of corrupted data.
Probably just a binary area.
You're not that fucked up, Cale.
- How did you feel when you killed it?
- Killed what?
I never killed anything in my entire life!
Okay, how do you feel about household appliances?
- I don't feel anything.
- Cale...
You need to understand.
We need to interface.
You need me.
Like I need a chainsaw up my ass.
The thing is,
I read your file.
It took some code, but I finally got into Sonic Health's network, and then I got into you, which brings us back to your sink disposal unit.
I was giving, uh... her a bath.
I... only left her for a moment.
But she didn't drown, did she?
I got distracted, and I...
I couldn't hear the sounds.
Poor Amy.
That nasty machine at her arm all up.
Chewed it right off.
Child killer.
It was screaming so loud that I lost my temper.
I dragged her out of the sink, and she came away so easily.
I tried to hold her, but she slipped.
She's so slippery. And I'm holding on, but she's so slippery.
And so red.
And she's falling on the ground.
And I can't hold on to her.
And all the time, she'll die in my arms.
There are pieces of her little arm in the drain.
All right.
It's totally all right.
We're a system.
We're binary.
Two interactive units on the harddrive.
One motherboard.
I'll be your baby.
No.
- Give baby.
- I'll be your baby.
No!
How does that feel!
I... came to save you.
I don't need your saving.
I just need your help.
We need to destroy it all.
- How ya doin'?
- Not bad.
Listen to me!
Listen to me!
Your mission is still online!
You got that?
Take these down to the core containment.
We're gonna blow
Chaank to hell.
There's no way. There's no way I can get past that bulkhead.
That's why we gotta find Raimi and reload him.
He's got Carpenter's codes.
Come on!
God damn it!
Come on!
No!
Go, go, go!
Come on!
Come on, come on!
Come on.
No!
Hydraulically operated hoist!
Position: 20 floors above!
Secured at the roof!
Okay.
Come with me!
- Leave him!
- No!
We must consider him defunct!
- He's not defunct, he's just injured!
- I'm okay.
If one unit is safe, do not endanger it for a potential second!
We are not safe!
None of us are safe!
If one unit is safe...
...do not endager it...
...for a potential second!
Don't! Don't! Do! Or, I don't know--
All right, get this fucking machine off him!
Leave it, he'll be completely blank!
We have to load his program first in!
It... hurts... so...
Follow me!
And do not argue!
Stay close!
Next bay!
Service hatch!
Our exit to the hoist!
Cale! Reconnect the feeds beneath the drum!
- Yutani!
- Hai!
Re-engage clutch plate now!
Got it!
Raimi, just get out of there.
Raimi!
Are you deaf?
Raimi, get out of there!
Quiet!
Hai!
Shoryuken!
I'm out!
Now we move!
Go to the hoist!
Come on!
Come on!
- Go to the hoist!
- Not without you!
Go to the--
Shoot it!
Help me!
Help me!
Come here!
Come on!
Go!
Come on!
Directive!
Battle directive!
Battle directive... ended...
What the fuck is going on?
- Have you got Carpenter's card?
- Yeah.
I got the D-Lock sequence, too.
- Call me.
- Wait a minute.
- This is my mission, I started it.
- Well, then let's finish it.
Drop your weapon!
- On the floor!
- Relax, man, I'm the one who called you!
- Bullshit!
- You better call reinforcements!
You better shut the fuck up!
Too bad!
- This is unit 257...
- You stupid motherfucker!
You've got the right to remain silent!
Holy donuts!
Jesus Christ!
It jumped from the roof!
This way!
Come on!
Open it!
Come on!
Go!
Cale!
Come on!
Come on!
Tight grip!
Sequence!
- Swipe now.
- Ready?
- Yeah!
- One, two, three - swipe!
Welcome.
How long does this take?
- One, two, three - swipe!
- Welcome.
You should have run away when you had the chance.
Why didn't you just go away!
The needs of the many outweight the needs of the few.
That's a stupid reason!
You're making me kill you for a stupid reason!
God...
I thought...
...we could have a nice time.
And look after each other, and... do nice things.
God!
My hand hurts.
Come here, Jack.
Come here.
Download it, Jack.
You can interface with the motherboard.
What did... what did you do that for?
Show this to the cops.
What's going on?
- I'm leaivng you, Jack.
- Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...
Here...
Play with this.
Goodbye, Jack.
Don't leave me in here,
Cale, I don't like it.
Cale, if you leave me in here,
I will kill you!
I mean it, you fucking bitch!
And I'll blow you to bits!
Oh no.
It's a hell of a fire trap in there, man.
You better listen to me!
Because I'm dangerous!
Then you're in the right business, Jack.
I'm not in this business anymore.
Don't leave me in here.
Mama?
I don't like the dark.
For all the children.
In 1536... fleeing from the Inquisition, the alchemist
Uberto Fulcanelli disembarked in Veracruz,
Mexico.
Appointed official watchmaker to the Viceroy,
Fulcanelli was determined to perfect an invention which would provide him with the key to eternal life.
He was to name it... the Cronos device.
400 years later, one night in 1937, part of the vault in a building collapsed.
Among the victims was a man of strange skin, the color of marble in moonlight.
His chest mortally pierced, his last words...
Suo tempore.
This was the alchemist.
The authorities located the residence of the dead man.
What they found there was never fully revealed to the public.
After a brief investigation, the mansion and its contents were sold at public auction.
Never on any list or inventory was the Cronos device mentioned.
As far as anyone knew, it never existed.
MERRY CHRISTMAS
Sit up straight.
GRAND BAZAAR ANTIQUES
Here.
Go through these.
Only a few days left.
Tickets are running out for the big New Year's dance...
Excuse me.
Can I help you?
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
What can I do for you?
Now, this one.
Where does it go?
Very good.
Now he has a face.
You go now.
Early in the morning
At the break of day
Open up your little eyes
This one is still missing.
Put them in groups, by size and shape.
If you provoke them, it's worse, Aurora.
De la Guardia Enterprises.
What did you find?
Yes.
Right.
Another statue, huh?
Fine.
I'll tell him.
Ready.
Uncle?
Uncle?
Ahh... lovely day for breakfast pills.
Reds, yellows, blues.
And... the new draft of your will, ready to...
Shhh!
Why do you always have to be so noisy?
Just sign the new draft of your will.
I have news for you.
Our buyer just called.
Papers.
- Thank you.
- Now tell me, what did our buyer have to say to you?
Oh... same old thing.
I found another archangel.
So what are you waiting for?
No, not this time.
This time you get somebody else to pick up your garbage.
Not everything is garbage.
No, not that book again.
This is not garbage.
I know they all look the same to me.
That's part of the problem.
Open your eyes.
Look.
This is different.
This one will be mine!
Lovely day.
Good morning, sir.
Are you looking for something in particular?
Pricey.
It's unique.
Yeah, sure.
They all are.
But... then,
It's not my money.
Keep the change.
I'll wrap it for you.
I love these mirrors.
You want it?
Yes?
No?
Yes.
May I ask your opinion about something?
- Of course.
- And yours too.
Very "importante."
Very important.
- Do you like this one?
- No.
No.
- How about this one?
- No.
- And this one?
- That one.
Which one?
That one.
You like it too?
Thank you very much.
You don't know how important this is to me.
A present.
And thanks to both of you.
Good luck.
No, honey, it's not chocolate.
Something like this happens once in a lifetime.
Once in a lifetime.
Well, nothing happened.
Look, it's funny.
What do you think it is?
A toy?
Stay away from it.
Don't be scared.
Get me a box.
One, two, three.
And one, two.
One, two, three.
Now, listen carefully.
This is seven in four.
We'll start with this leg, Manuelito.
And one, two, three and four, five, six and seven.
One, two, three, four.
Don't grunt, Manuelito.
- Excuse me.
- And...
And now, the finale.
Good afternoon.
Where did you fall down?
On some broken glass.
- You won't need any stitches.
- Ouch!
Men are such whiners. Do you remember when Blondie March died?
Everyone was soaked in blood and she was clean as a whistle.
But dead as a doornail.
There's something in there.
This will hurt.
Thanks for letting me know.
I almost got it.
It was buried deep.
- What is it?
- I don't know. A metal filing.
No, it looks more like a stinger.
From a bee. I don't know.
Please, please.
Be very careful. I beg you, please.
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
No. l'm okay, darling.
I'm okay.
Good morning.
- I'm reading.
- There's too much light.
It's incredible, you know?
Baby Vizcaina died at 92...
Do you like it?
No.
You look... different, a lot younger.
ExactIy. That's the point.
That's how I feel.
Where's Aurora?
- Don't you want breakfast?
I'm not hungry.
Hey, do you like it or not?
- Yes, I do.
- Good.
I'm glad.
DE LA GUARDlA ENTERPRlSES
ANGEL DE LA GUARDIA
Hi, Mr. Gris!
How are you? Okay?
You destroyed my shop!
I'm not the one you want to talk to.
The red ones are especially good today.
You don't know what you're getting yourself into.
AImost 40 years ago,
I found this manuscript.
Forty years.
They are the notes, the inscrutable writings of a 16th-century alchemist.
It's a fascinating text.
It's written backwards, in Latin.
It describes a very peculiar mechanism, an invention that prolongs the life of the person who uses it.
But there are rules, precise and very strict rules about its usage.
- An insect?
- That's the stroke of genius.
An insect is trapped in the device.
It's like a living filter.
You think so?
I mean, after all these years.
Who says insects aren't
God's favorite creatures?
Christ walked on water, just like a mosquito.
The matter of the resurrection is related to ants, to spiders.
They can remain inside a rock for hundreds of years until someone comes along and frees them.
Of course.
All of this is very enlightening, but why tell me?
I'm dying, Mr. Gris.
I'm going to show you something.
The scalpel has been eating away at me bit by bit.
Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, psychotherapy.
Look carefully, my friend.
Half of my body is here, in this case.
And the other half is already on the menu... or is being devoured right now, while we talk.
No! That's mine!
You used it?
You used it?
- It was an accident.
You fool!
Angel!
Here I am, Uncle.
Here I am.
Oh, Mr. Gris.
My uncle is getting impatient.
De la Guardia!
We both have something to lose.
Mr. Gris?
You may continue the game.
After all, you have the toy.
But I'm keeping the instructions.
And I won't relent. lmpossible.
I put it here, damn it!
Aurora! My God.
Aurora?
I know you have it.
Aurora.
Aurora?
Are you scared?
Do you think something will happen to me?
Are you comfortable back there?
This happened to me once before, with your dad.
Do you remember him, even a little bit?
Yes.
I would imagine so.
When he was your age, he overheard someone talking about people who die of Iung cancer.
So when I got home from work,
I found my cigarettes had vanished.
After looking all over,
I went in the bathroom and found many little bits of tobacco.
They were floating in the toilet.
Just little bits.
I think he understood later that destroying my cigarettes didn't help matters at all.
But at least, I understood that he was worried.
And he understood that I had understood.
You know what?
I don't know what's wrong with me.
But I think it's best if we're together.
- Jesus.
- Just a minute.
- I need your help.
- Just a minute.
Hurry up, darling.
We're going to be late.
Who are you, little one?
A god?
You're very good for me.
I don't know why this dress doesn't fit.
I wore it for last year's dance. l'm almost ready.
How could I change so much in so little time?
Do you remember?
Do I remember?
My love l can't believe it's all over
And life has separated us
Do I remember?
The first time I saw you,
I thought you wouldn't give me the time of day.
I felt so small...
That's what architects call vectors.
- That's amazing.
- That's it?
The small parts always support the large ones.
- But what holds it up?
- It's not a play on words. The pillars...
- Teacher.
- l'lI be right with you, Manuelito.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
What's wrong?
Is something wrong?
- l'lI be right back.
- Where are you going?
To get a drink.
It's hot.
This always happens to me.
- Are you feeling better?
- Yes.
Every time I drink, I have to pee.
I've been listening to this music since I was a little boy.
What a fucking decadent party.
RealIy.
Give me a fucking break.
Look what they did here.
The party got crashed by some Argentinean or a Peruvian, shit.
You break your back alI year long to go to a nice party...
Fuck.
I'm leaving.
Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three,
HAPPY NEW YEAR - TlGERS CLUB two, one!
It has been a pleasure, an honor for Day Radio, to bring to your homes the traditional live broadcast of the Tigers Club annual party.
We're always thinking of you and wishing you the very best.
May all your New Year's resolutions have a most joyous outcome and open the most wonderful paths to you.
Here, in HPLM's sound booth, we feel honored, overwhelmed - yes, why not say it - overwhelmed with joy to hear from you, to answer your calls.
Mrs. Lorenza wants to send her warmest regards to the whole family.
And she wishes the very best for us all.
Mrs. Lupita Raquel sends everyone her wishes for glory to God in heaven, peace on earth and goodwill.
How beautiful.
You.
Happy New Year.
Tell me where it is or my uncle won't leave me alone.
What is it exactly... this thing?
What the fuck does the old man want with it?
He never told you?
You all think I'm stupid, don't you?
He thinks it will help him live longer.
That fucker does nothing but shit and piss all day, and he wants to live longer?
Leave me alone.
Do what you have to do, but leave me alone.
Of course, sir.
I will leave you, when... and if... it pleases me.
Get it?
Get up.
Get up!
Fuck!
Fuck!
So quiet.
My God, so much blood.
All that blood is mine. l'm dying.
Unbelievable.
Everything's upside down.
And l'm dying.
Alone.
Don't let me die today. l'm in so much pain. l can endure a lot more.
A lot more.
Oh, Aurora.
Wow, Tito. Wow.
The forehead is turning out... perfect.
It looks totally normal.
It's your best work yet.
- Fuck, yeah.
There's a technique to this.
I'm giving it shape, texture, color.
You have to be a fucking artist.
Yes.
But don't go to so much trouble.
We're going to cremate him.
What?
Fuck me! What do you mean we're going to burn him?
You should've told me before
I fixed the fucker, God rest his soul.
Nobody respects my work here.
Why didn't you guys let me know?
You! Why didn't you let me know?
The widow changed her mind.
It looks like the guy didn't make preparations.
He didn't buy a niche, or a grave plot, nothing.
They're all the same.
The bastards think they'll live forever.
Plastic surgery, contrary to...
Fuck.
- Yes, Uncle.
- Get up here immediately.
Stupid-motherfucker-cocksucking son-of-a-bitch asshole-pendejo.
- I want to know what happened.
- I'll be right there.
Shit.
I can't blow this.
I didn't touch him, the car skidded.
- Went off the cliff.
- You imbecile!
Uncle...
What about his heart?
What about it?
Did you hurt it in any way?
I told you
I didn't touch him!
His car skidded, it went off the cliff...
Did you check his heart?
It wasn't beating.
Did anything accidentally pierce it?
What's the difference?
He's dead.
It makes all the difference, all the difference!
Oh, you clumsy beast.
You can't do anything right.
After all these years I thought there might be hope for you.
But you're useless, useless.
You probably ruined the whole thing by now.
How can somebody be deader than dead?
You know nothing about dying.
I don't understand.
No, you don't understand.
And you'll remain that way.
But there is one last thing you still have to do, and you better do it right because I'm not going to rest till
I have what is rightfully mine.
And neither are you.
Look at that.
Was it a lively wake?
We won't send you to heaven like this.
Naked, with lipstick smudges all over.
They'll think you went whoring.
Here you go, buddy.
Come in, sir. Come in.
Make yourself at home.
Tito, Mr. De la Guardia is - was a friend of the deceased.
He wants to see the body one last time.
Of course.
Medium or well done?
Ohh...
HE ISN'T DEAD
HE JUST LEFT EARLY
THE FAMILY OF JESUS GRIS
THANKS YOU
FOR BEING WITH US
DURING THESE TRYING TIMES
Hello?
Yes?
Mercedes.
Is that for me?
Dear Mer... cedes.
It's very hard to write these lines to you.
I want you to know that, somehow, for some reason, l'm still alive.
And being alive is very painful. l'm burning with thirst.
And everything feels foreign to me, the day, this house... and you.
Aurora will stay with you.
She will leave you this letter.
By the time you read it,
I will have gone to a kind of appointment to resolve unfinished business.
If l've lost everything, at least l'd like to know why.
Just today I realize how much I miss you.
I hope to find you here when I come back, willing to see me, regardless of my appearance.
Love,
Jesus.
Aurora.
For God's sake, what are you doing here?
I told you not to come, Aurora.
Put that away.
Don't you realize they could kill us?
Don't you realize we're in danger?
It works.
I knew you'd be back.
If you're looking for the missing pages, you're wasting your time. l ate them.
Best meal I've had in years.
You talk about eternity.
Look at me, look at my skin.
It's rotting. It's falling to pieces.
Peel it off.
What? What are you talking about?
Look.
What's happening to me?
You've been reborn.
What the fuck is it now, you dried up old prune?
Why is this happening?
Why this new skin?
And don't answer with riddles!
You talk about insects, about alchemists, about devices.
But what am I missing?
Blood.
Human?
Of course.
You can't gain eternity with a cow or a pig.
I can break the device, smash it to pieces.
As you wish.
If the device goes, you go.
But... we can share... eternity.
I don't give a damn about eternity!
I don't want to live forever. l just want out of this.
That's even better.
There is a way out.
But first, the device.
I don't trust you.
I don't think you have a choice.
Give it to me, darling.
Give it to me, I know what I'm doing.
But first... my way out.
As you wish.
You don't even bleed right.
And now the heart...
My God, Aurora.
Uncle?
Talk to me...
Let's go, okay?
Let's go.
Please.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Mine, mine... everything is mine.
Mine, mine, mine.
Angel.
Enough.
You kept me waiting long enough.
You...
Fuck... not my nose again.
This has to end.
Oh, Mr. Gris. now I have to kill you again.
Mr. Gris.
Go on.
Go on!
Come here, precious.
Come here.
Angel!
What the fuck do I have to do to kill you?
You've got more to lose.
For me, it's just pain.
Get ready for some more.
What the...
Grandfather.
No!
I am Jesus...
Gris.
Jesus Gris.

Persistent, aren't you?
Why do you keep following me?
What are you playing at?
Get lost.
What's the matter?
Hey, what's the matter?
Sleepy, Minori?
Daddy had a dream...
I was in an open space with my family.
I was a child again.
- With your foster parents?
- No.
- Did you remember?
- No.
But it was...
...a wonderful dream.
So peaceful too.
Sorry.
I remember being adopted at eight.
I've no memories before that.
Strange, isn't it?
Your new parents told you nothing?
There aren't even any photo's.
How old were you in your dream?
Excuse me.
Minori!
There he is!
Somebody stop them.
Shall I let you go?
Please don't.
I beg you, please don't.
And him too?
Damn you.
Bye- .
I'll kill you.
You really bug me.
Hey!
Coming for a swim?
You need to get strong.
Shall we go home, since you're so worried about the plants?
He did it.
That tune...
That woman in my dream...
It must have been my mother who sang it.
Very quietly.
Hello.
How did the training go?
Go and look for Minori.
- Please leave us alone.
- He's not here.
You shouldn't leave the back door unlocked.
Stay here.
Where's Minori?
I dropped him.
I'll kill you.
Now I remember...
Something...
Something's going to be destroyed.
What kind of guy did you pick?
To avoid accidents...
...he's a mild specimen.
Let's start.
From inside the man's brain... select a really calm image.
Watch as I manipulate it.
Continue.
- Stop.
- Continue.
Enough.
Return to the first image.
Fantastic.
The will to kill.
That's what counts.
Sacrifice him.
We'll give him an oxide shot.
He'll...
...corrode away.
This is the fruit of his cells and my brains.
Who'll be the first to test it?
Why don't you volunteer?
You'd do.
- Let's make ourselves some money.
- I don't want money.
Destruction is all I need.
Well done.
We've been together a long time.
Give everyone a shot.
With this...
The strength of the will to kill decides.
Killing him will be simple.
You'll be blown to pieces like your brat.
I'm going to do the same to you as I did to your brat.
What the hell's going on?
God...
He was truly... a god.
Who?
The man who can make us all gods.
He's a fiend.
So it wasn't because of...
It's dangerous here.
Let's leave.
You...
What are you?
I don't know, any more than you.
It's true. Believe me.
Please save me, Kana.
I'm scared.
Please save me.
Minori!
Minori!
Minori!
You laughed.
You laughed then.
You'll laugh when I'm killed.
Now I'm really angry!
He doesn't seem to care much for you.
The old fool didn't design this gun very well.
But why...?
How is he different?
He used will-power to transform himself.
When he was a kid...
he was strange.
Even when he was bullied... he never fought back.
He always bowed and scraped.
But one day, someone snatched some gladioli bulbs he treasured.
Straight away... he beat all the other kids up.
Most of them died.
And his beloved gladioli bulbs were crushed too.
Your husband's name is
Tomoo Taniguchi? Right?
Who are you?
Trust me to come across him.
He really is a devil.
Tell me what happened to him.
Please.
Where's Kana?
We're holding her.
Kill me and she dies.
Inject this or she dies.
Choose.
She'll die.
- Where's Kana?
- You don't care if she dies?
He hasn't changed at all.
Hostages don't seem to mean anything.
Taniguchi.
Tomoo Taniguchi.
You were always like that.
Losing what you loved.
Please, tell me.
What happened to him?
Happy birthday to you.
Take a good look.
Take a good look.
No!
Happy birthday to you.
Rust and die!
I'll inject you.
Rust and die.
Take a good look.
Look what I'm going to do.
It's magic.
Good.
Now nobody can beat you.
Abracadabra.
Good. When your will and the gun's are as one... you'll be able to kill the dog.
You will help me, won't you?
Your father is the only one in the world who can make the human weapon.
When they see you, important people will believe me.
Don't let him remember.
Take a good look.
I made it.
Don't.
After that, my big brother lost his memory.
Was it sadness at losing our mother?
I don't think he felt sorry he'd killed our parents.
He felt...
the beauty in destruction.
That scared him and he lost his memory.
I understand that better than anyone.
The strength of his will to kill always beat mine.
My only weapon is my arm.
He's not scared of anything now.
You feel the beauty in destruction.
So go ahead, destroy.
Destroy the greatest thing of all.
Pick that up.
Inject my body with it.
Quickly...Kana!
It's so peaceful.

A long, long time ago,
Nosferatu, the undead, the race of the vampire, were driven from Egypt.
Most fled to the mountains of Transylvania but others of better taste, including myself, travelled south through Africa and over the Atlantic to a beautiful island in the Bermuda Triangle.
There we lived for happy centuries feasting on the blood of travellers, until discovered by the hunters once again.
Then, the blood that spilled
Was our oWn.
I alone escaped but a vampire alone is a vampire doomed.
My only chance was to find the one known offspring of our tribe that had been born in a foreign land - a woman somewhere in this place called Brooklyn.
Family Feud brings you the world's first War Of The Showgirls!
Atlantic City versus Las Vegas.
Here's my show! Come on, baby, you make me ex cited.
Name something a playboy might have made out of silk.
Sheets!
- She ain't gonna get it.
- Put me down for ten on the Knicks.
You betting on the Knicks?
When will you learn?
Call me! I'm gonna take you for an eight-piece special with biscuit!
Sheets, baby. Sheets!
You make me ex cited.
Come on down.
S-H-E-E-T. Sheets!
- That's what I'm talking about!
- Oh, shit.
- The bitch said it!
- Let me see...sheets!
Earthquake! Earthquake!
This ain't no earthquake, this is New York, fool!
What was that?
- Oh, shit!
- What the fuck is going on?
What the hell happened?
Is this how people come, disrespecting your shit, man?
Ain't that a bitch? What...?
It's a bird!
Get the hell away from me! Good God, what the hell's happening here?
Damn. Look at this ugly thing.
Who the hell's piloting this vessel,
Stevie fucking Wonder?!
Must be a DUI.
I don't see no lights.
I don't see no people, either.
Damn, look at the time!
I gotta bounce, Unc,
I'm supposed to be at my lady's crib.
- Julius, bring your ass back here!
- I don't know about this!
I run numbers, you check out spooky-ass ships!
- Go ahead with your bad self.
- Chump!
I'm not supposed to be scared, huh?
Ahoy there! Hello!
Ahoy, motherfucker!
Son of a bitch.
Oh, y'all the silent type?
Well, somebody's gonna buy me a new TV!
16-inch colour.
Ahoy there! You in there, somebody?
Is this a joke?
Ahoy!
Arrogant motherfuckers in here don't wanna say nothin'. Shit.
I'm too old for this shit. Ahoy!
Hello.
Help me! Help me!
Oh, help, somebody! Help me!
Help me, please.
That sure as hell wasn't Lassie.
Big motherfucker!
Jesus, Mary and Jo-Jo.
Jesus, Mary and Jo-Jo!
Get the hell outta here!
Don't be bringing your nappy black ass back here!
- My Adidas! Damn, what' d I do?
- You was snorin'!
- Everybody snores!
- Not while they fuckin'!
- Piece of trash!
- Eva, come back! I was restin'!
Rest this!
You'll be beggin' me back tomorrow.
That's all right.
- That's Julius. He owes you money?
- I see him.
Oh, shit. Pizza Man.
- Comin' through!
- I'll get you!
You better run! I'm coming after you!
Run, baby. Run!
I'm comin' after you, baby!
Yeah! I want you!
Hey, get off my hood, man!
- Mind if I borrow your hat?
- Go ahead.
Thank you.
Come on. Hey, man.
Ain't as fast as you used to be, huh, Julius?
- Tony, I didn't know it was you.
- Are you mental?
How many times have I gotta tell you?
I'm Anthony. He's Tony.
Oh, yeah, that's Tony. Right.
You know. All you gumbas look alike to me.
- You got our money?
- Yeah.
- Oh, shit. I had it a minute ago.
- Then you're a minute too late.
You don't have to do that to me.
- Who 'll take care of my kids?
- You don't have any kids.
I'll start.
Don't worry about it, Julius.
Nobody's gonna miss you.
Do it.
I wouldn't do that.
You might miss the heart.
You aim between the eyes, that way you get a nice, even spray.
- What the hell?
- Who the fuck are you?
I'm Maximillian, a connoisseur of death, you might say.
No one takes pride in the art, it's so rare you come across a clean kill nowadays.
You got two seconds to beat it or you're gonna share a coffin with Carl Lewis.
- I already have a coffin of my own.
- Come on.
- He's no fun. He fell right over.
- Some fuckin' wackos in this town.
Let's get back to you, Julius.
I guess you're out of bullets, huh, man?
No, I kept one special just for you.
Interesting.
I've been stabbed and I've been hanged and I've been burned, even broken on the rack once, but I've never been shot before.
It kind of itches a little.
You have quite decent aim, though.
But next time... put a little heart into it.
Oh, shit!
Don't go away.
He's gonna get it with the gun!
No, don't!
Holy shit!
He ain't gonna get me!
I've seen it all. I'm getting my ass the hell out of Brooklyn.
I'm going to the islands, somewhere peaceful.
Coney Island.
Ryker's Island. Devil's Island.
- Let me light that for you.
- Oh, shit!
Hey, yo, I don't know how you know me but... everything is everything,
I ain't seen nothing.
So you jump back through the window cos I ain't really seen you,
I'm blind!
I got cataracts, I mean contacts.
I got astigmatism, man. I'm blind.
Where you at? See? Where you at?
I saw you at the docks.
You're a liar, a thief and a cheat.
No, that's my brother Miles.
I'm honest.
Well, that's unfortunate because that's what I liked about you.
Hey, easy, bro. You ain't got to pull that Blacula shit with me.
If you're hungry, I'll run you down the KFC and get you a two-piece.
I already had Italian.
You're going to make me think you don't like me.
Wouldn't want to do that, now, would we?
I got nothing but love for you, baby.
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?
Welcome to the party, Julius.
- Oh, shit!
- It hurts, doesn't it?
Pain is an underrated experience but it happens to be my speciality and like it or not, you belong to me now.
H-hey, bro, why you do that?
It feels kinda...kinda right.
Because I need your eyes in the day and your services at night.
But first I need my coffin. Come!
Wait! Where you going?
What's up?
You ain't gonna be sucking my neck?
Why? You're my ghoul now.
I need you to help me find a woman.
A woman? You came to the right spot.
Brooklyn's full of hos.
I'm not interested in your hos.
I'm looking for a special woman, one of my kind, the only one like her in the world.
As I've come to her, she'll soon come to me like a moth to a flame.
So you're checking for a vampster bitch?
Half vampire and she's ignorant of it.
The other half sleepwalks in humanity but I can cure that if
I find her before the next full moon.
- Here?
- Yes, here. Somewhere in Brooklyn.
This night shift is kicking my ass.
How come you never get tired?
I've always been more of a night person myself.
This is a good one, listen up now.
"Your faith will be tested as a loved one dances with death.
"Beware the dark stranger
"and when all's lost, look to your soul for the answers."
- I wouldn't wanna be you this week.
- This is your horoscope, not mine.
That's my horoscope? Oh, shit.
We have no information on the cause of death but all bodies so far seem drained of blood.
- What the hell is this, Captain?
- Love Boat came in a few hours ago.
There was 18 that we know of.
Whole gang's DOA.
Aw, jeez. Ship's log?
Sort of - half rotten and it's in a strange language.
Sent it to NYU to see if they could figure it out.
- Witnesses?
- Night watchman, Silas Green.
Let him tell you what he thinks he saw.
All right.
- Hey, Rita.
- Hey.
- How's your new partner holding up?
- She's cool, she just needs time.
She's had three months already.
I know her mother just died in a nuthouse but she's got a job to do.
She's a good cop.
She'll surprise you.
That's what I'm afraid of.
- I got it.
- Kinda narrow here.
- Watch your step, lady.
- Ex cuse me.
My back is killing me.
How many more we got?
15 of them left.
- Careful there.
- Give me your light.
You need a cast-iron stomach.
So you say you saw a...a what?
It was a wolf, goddammit!
Big, black-ass wolf!
Motherfucker jumped off the boat, ran over there and the son of a bitch turned into a man! Did the flip-flop shit on me!
Just like a whore I knew in Detroit in '62, '63.
I' d go over her house Saturday night,
I come through the door, she's a man! Flip-floppin' and shit!
You ever had a motherfucker flip-flop on you, going crazy and shit?
So the wolf you saw looked something like that?
The wolf? That's a chihuahua compared to the motherfucker come at me!
You're crazy. You seen a wolf, man?
- Yeah.
- To the 25th power!
You people belong behind the line!
- Hey, B, where's your coffin at?
- It's on the boat.
On the boat? Shit, we can't get it now, look at all these cops.
And you people, you people better keep back. Killer loves to bite.
And so do I. Jump!
Killer?
- Here...here, boy.
- Oh, shit. Lovely, dude.
Hello.
Someone here?!
It's you.
Someone there?
Shit. Damn!
- Chill. It's just me.
- Shit!
- Did you see him?
- There's nobody here but us.
Someone's here. I saw him or it.
It? What the fuck... hey, what's wrong with you?
There's a coffin.
In here, come on.
Right in there. Look.
What? I don't see anything.
- l-I could've sworn...
- Rita, are you OK?
I'm fine. Absolutely fine!
Good, cos that's exactly what I told
Captain Dewey - absolutely fine.
- Right.
- You all right?
Let me out of here.
What is that?
It's an ear.
A rotted-off human ear.
Yeah, but my ear? Look!
My fucking ear done fell off!
You've another on the other side.
Besides, the benefits of being a ghoul outweigh the drawbacks.
What benefits?
Benefit my fucking ear back on!
You put me in the monster union?
I'm on Blue Cross?
I meant Blue Shield, brother.
I have taken refuge in some sorry places...
This is a bargain.
My Uncle Silas is the landlord...
What the hell is all this damn noise?
Julius, is that you?
- It's me.
- You little scared piece of shit.
I ought to whoop your ass for booking out on me.
- You wouldn't believe what I saw.
- Oh, I bet you I would.
Nobody believes me.
I know a big-ass wolf when I see one!
- What the hell's going on?!
- Just...
Who 's that?
- That's my boss.
- You got a job?
What do you mean? Of course
I got a job! I got a good job, too.
- He just need a place to lay low.
- Rent's double.
- No, what?
- Triple.
- You know you missing an ear?
- That's just a trick I'm working on.
You can't triple the rent. You got...
Night started off like shit but... end up pretty good.
I don't turn nothing down but my collar. Howdy do.
Welcome. Trash man comes on Tuesdays.
God loves you, God loves me, bye.
Good thing you ran into me.
I'll hook you up.
I'll make sure everything we do is gonna be right.
First, we in Brooklyn now, man.
You gotta get rid of this thing.
You ever heard of a futon?
Lighter, comfortabler, better for your back, good to fuck on.
You gonna scratch your ass fucking on this.
A couple of things to know.
One, never sit on my coffin.
Two, I want to find the girl tonight!
Sounds good, yeah. Is there a three?
I don't like mirrors!
Got it.
Maybe I am going crazy.
What's happening to me?
Justice, it's not just the bodies or the ear, I got a feeling.
You got a feeling about everything and what do I say?
"Everything by the book."
But if it ain't in the book, going by the book won't solve it.
All I'm saying is give something to intuition.
We've got a development in that boat-people mess.
A couple of stiffs on Bates Street.
One guy was ripped to pieces.
- What about the other guy?
- He's in one piece
- ex cept he's missing a heart.
- Two blocks from the docks.
- Very good.
- What about the ship's log?
The university couldn't make sense of it so they sent it to this Dr...
Zeko.
Apparently, some sort of specialist.
- Zeko. What's the address?
- 315 South Rockaway.
That's a tough neighbourhood.
What kind of doctor is he?
I don't know, maybe he's a heart specialist.
- Let's check it out.
- I didn't finish my coffee.
Take it with you. Go. Come on.
Captain, here's the latest figures on the boat.
Zeko 's, huh? Yeah, I got me the 411.
I got the info and a Happy Meal.
Good!
Things were progressing well.
Rita's vision of herself dead in my coffin was a certain sign she was destined to be my mate.
Even my ghoul was performing well those duties only a ghoul can do when the cursed sun drives a vampire to the shelter of his coffin.
In return, he would enjoy all the perks of ghouldom, maybe someday make vampire himself, all with only minor side effects.
Shit! What...
What are you...
What are you doing sitting there?
- You got the dropsies, I think.
- Got no dropsies.
So, tell me, uh...tell me what you think of these wheels.
I say lucky it's an automatic cos you don't have enough hands to shift and drive at the same damn time.
- A wedding?
- A funeral.
- Very nice touch.
- I knew you' d like it.
I used to look like that in '62.
Same hair. Same clothes.
Stop harassing the man.
If I was you,
I' d take a dick check quick.
It's all there. It's all there.
Thank God for small favours, and I do mean small.
See that?
Young punk.
Max, why didn't you bite this bitch when you had the chance?
She has to give herself to me voluntarily.
Hey, this is Brooklyn, baby.
Don't nobody give up shit unless you got some cold cash or a hot slug.
In this case, I know more about her than she knows about herself.
One dance with me, one dance, and she'll be mine.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Now you're talking, player.
I bet you dance that Hammer shit.
Show me what you gonna do when you get in there.
Show me that old Hammer shit you gonna do. That's some good shit, man.
Am I gonna be able to disappear in the mirror too?
I'm warning you. Drive the limo and shut your fucking mouth.
- Shut up!
- Hey, man, not while I'm driving!
- Shut the fuck up!
- Shit! I'm driving...
- Goddammit!
- ...and you give me a brain aneurysm?
You put somebody eye out!
I had the lab do a check on that seaweed that was all over the boat.
Seems that type only grows in an isolated area of the Caribbean.
Caribbean?
My mother did her studies down there before she had me.
How come you don't talk about your mother?
The paper said she was incredible.
There's nothing to talk about.
I never really knew her.
She flipped. They stuck her in the institution, me in a foster home.
- How' d your father handle it?
- He didn't.
He was murdered down in the islands before I was born.
I wish I had known him, at least something about him but...
- Wait a minute.
- What?
- If we're right, that's Dr Zeko 's.
- That's one funky doctor's office.
- So where is this guy?
- I don't know.
- Closer than you think.
- Dr Zeko, I'm...
I know who you are and why you're here.
You know where this ship came from?
Any one of 100 isles in the swells of the Sargasso Sea, in an area you call the Bermuda Triangle.
- Sit down.
- The Bermuda Triangle?
Dr Zeko, what does the log say?
It spoke of a voyage filled with sickness and nightmares.
- They believed an evil was aboard.
- An evil?
I thought they killed the last of them but these men warn us from beyond - he is here.
He?
Nosferatu. The undead. The vampire.
Look, nothing personal, my man, but this is a murder investigation, not a witch-hunt.
Now, that boat's crew are sleeping at the morgue, they are not... cruising the boulevard sucking necks.
The world is full of false notions,
Detective.
Vampires are a race, not a club you join by being bitten.
Yeah, yeah, a race, not a club.
- Of course(!)
- Beware, Detective.
This is more deadly than anything your job has shown you.
A vampire has no mercy, no regrets.
He can change shapes.
He could be sitting next to us now and we wouldn't even know it.
Yeah, well, I would know it.
Rita, I'm gonna call in.
All right.
Dr Zeko, how do you know so much about this?
On my island...
I faced one over a woman.
I lost. She was taken.
Here's my best advice and please listen carefully.
Keep your faith, Rita.
If I know one thing, it's this - you'll need it.
Do you have a problem, pal?
- There's a killer on the loose.
- You don't say.
And what might you know about him?
Well, he's very smart, very quick
- and quite deadly.
- Do you know where this killer is?
He's right behind you.
- It's all right.
- Oh, I'm gonna die.
No, not quite yet.
They're very much like us, you see... misunderstood.
Sorry. This never happened before.
That's unbelievable.
- Thank God you were here.
- God had nothing to do with it.
- I'm Max.
- Rita. Rita Veder.
I think...
You know, I know this is gonna sound like a line but I really feel like I've seen you somewhere before.
- Do you believe in the supernatural?
- I might.
Well, I had this dream...
What kind of dream?
There was a beautiful woman... a woman with a smile so lovely it could brighten the darkest night.
But she was trapped.
She was trapped in a prison where the moon never shined.
She couldn't escape because she didn't know how.
And then I came and I set her free.
Did you?
The woman was you, Rita.
I recognise you.
Well...
How did you set me free?
I set you free with a dance.
Let me show you.
Come.
What am I thinking? I can't.
I'm on duty.
On duty? Sounds like a personal problem. Do you know who this is?
This ain't Nick Ashford, this is Maximillian, all right?
This mofo 's got a pussy surplus.
Solid as a rock!
All right, fuck it, then.
He want to get it on with you, see?
So just be nice and show my man some respect cos he'll put it on with you.
- She's straightened out, boss.
- I'm sorry.
No. Who knew you were so popular?
But it's a good thing, cos I wouldn't dance with you if you were the last man on earth.
- You ready?
- Yeah. More than.
- I'll see you again, Rita.
- In your dreams, Max.
- She's one of a kind.
- She is. Not your kind, though.
Fuck them. I got these two...
This tongue of yours has complicated a very simple plan.
If it happens again,
I'll hang you with it, understand?
I'll have to take drastic measures, time is short.
Hey, you the boss...
Gimme a break. You saying some kind of evil spirit stowed away on board?
- What if I am, huh? You want cream?
- No.
Dewey heard you, she' d have you in a straitjacket.
Sometimes I feel things, all right?
Now, I didn't ask for it,
I don't understand it but you can't explain it all by the book.
You finally get a man back here and you're gonna kick his ass.
Interesting approach.
Uh, Justice, this is my roommate, Nikki.
Nikki, my partner, Justice.
From the way y'all was arguing,
I' d swear you was in love.
- No.
- Good.
Look, I'm gonna go on back to the crib, cos, um...
- it's getting a little late and...
- Wait a minute.
- You don't want the coffee?
- No, you can buy me some tomorrow.
I've had my fill of superstition.
Next we'll be seeing little green men.
Right. Sure, whatever, OK.
You can find your way out, right?
You sure you don't want coffee?
No, I'm breaking out.
Who painted this?
That's Rita's.
She paints things she sees in her nightmares.
Rita's got weird taste in art but good taste in men.
It's real late. Gotta go.
Bye.
Freud would say that if you leave something this important behind, it means you really don't want to go.
Two words - cold shower.
Thank you.
Now, he's obviously a man of poor taste.
My sentiments exactly.
You sure ain't from around here.
Yes, you could say
I'm a long way from home.
Mine's upstairs. Would you like to warm up with some coffee or... some other refreshment?
But I wouldn't want to keep you up.
Oh! Fuck me! Fuck me!
Oh, baby. Say my name, baby.
Keep it coming!
I feel...I feel like...
Damn you, Justice.
- Goddamn you.
- I'm coming!
- I'm coming!
- I do not believe you.
Let me see your face.
Let me see your face!
This part of the seduction is quite simple, really.
Just take away everything she has, then give her everything she needs.
Rita. Girl, I finally found a man who can make the room spin.
Moving out to find a place of my own, cos we're gonna need the room to roam. Ciao baby, Nikki.
Right.
Oh yeah, you, like, figure out what she's into and then fuck her head up with it?
In a manner of speaking, yes.
But church.
She had to go to a church.
My pops said the quickest way to a woman's heart is through the church!
It's through the rib cage but that's messy.
No, there are much more interesting ways to her heart.
Through her fears, for instance, or through her faith.
- Ex cuse me.
- Just a second, son.
Preacher...Pauley?
And if you've been misbehavin',
Preacher Pauley's here for savin'.
Well...
I think that I'm beyond saving.
- Going to church?
- I just wanna catch Preacher first, is he still in the parking lot?
Preacher. I'm Preacher Pauley.
Yes, how are you tonight? Rita Veder, how are you tonight, girl?
I've been tossing about this case I'm on.
- Tossin', right.
- I've been having these... really strange feelings.
I felt I needed to talk to someone that I could trust.
You come to the right place.
Tossin' and havin' strange feelings.
- And then I heard the voices.
- You heard voices.
- Yes, like they were inside my head.
- In your head?
Really. Does this make sense?
Is it possible?
You' d be surprised what's possible.
I'm just afraid of ending up like my mother, afraid I'm losing my mind.
Afraid you're going crazy, that's good. It's good to get that out.
You fear you're going crazy, tell people. You need an outlet.
- I get it out in my paintings.
- You paint?
- Yes.
- It's good to paint.
You know, when I was young,
I used to paint...
Preacher Pauley!
Come on. Everybody's waitin'.
- I don't know if right now's...
- Go ahead.
The Lord waits for no one.
Get your butt in here.
Right now is not a good time!
Goddamn!
What did he say?
God damns anybody who doesn't glorify in His work!
It's a hell of a night outside.
Let's do the sermon on the lawn.
Come on, sister. Goddamn!
Shit. Ex cuse me.
Can we bring it down just a little, please?
Brothers and sisters, please quiet down. Thank you.
We come here time after time and we talk about the same old same old.
Hey, quiet down.
- We talk about Jesus.
- That's right.
Jesus said and Jesus wept.
Jesus heard and Jesus walked over.
I don't wanna talk about Jesus.
Cos as the big man teaches us, there's two sides to every story.
Not one but two.
A story is not one-sided.
A story has duality.
There's two sides to every story.
Which brings to mind the phrase
"necessary evil".
I know many of you hear that phrase and say,
"That don't even make no sense to me.
"Can't be no such thing as necessary - how's evil necessary?
"That don't match. That's plaids and stripes, evil and necessary."
You see, because without bad, there is no good.
Without light, there is no dark, you need both these things.
You hear what I'm saying?
If every day is a sunny day, well, then, what's a sunny day?
Well, the bottom line, what I'm trying to tell you tonight, is that evil...eeeevil... is necessary.
Evil is necessary, thereby, if it's necessary, evil...
- Evil...
- ...must be good.
Evil is good.
That's what I think.
Evil must be good, must be good.
- Let me hear y'all say it...
- Evil is good.
Evil is good. Take Brother Brown, one of our strongest deacons, pillar of stability.
Brother Brown was on Bushwick Avenue last night with a two-dollar whore.
- I didn't know she was no whore!
- You lyin' dog,
- you said you was at your mother's.
- Now, that's evil.
When you tell your wife,
"I'm going to see Mama," then you go get you a two-dollar ho, that's evil.
But Brother Brown had a good time with that two-dollar ho.
You can push a two-dollar ho and she don't have no limits!
Evil and good walk hand in hand.
- Evil is as evil does.
- I thought I' d find you here.
- What are you doing here?
- The captain has something for us, info on those stiffs in the dumpster.
What's wrong?
- Remember Nikki.
- You fucked her, didn't you?
We got us another one!
- Fucked who?
- You know damn well who. Nikki.
- You know damn well!
- What?
Nikki! The whore of Babylon.
That's what she was.
- The whore of Babylon.
- I never touched that girl.
Then you should change your shirts more often.
- Her lipstick's on your collar!
- Lipstick on his collar!
What kind of man are you?
It's a shame and a shock!
- It didn't happen like that.
- Tell her.
Don't be ashamed of yourself, boy.
Don't be ashamed cos you went out and got you a little ass!
- Ass is good!
- That's right!
I know many of y'all may be saying,
"How can he say ass is good?"
How y'all think y'all got here?
Ass is good!
Evil's good and ass is good.
And if you get you a piece of evil ass...
Rita, where are you going?
Rita, you buggin'.
- This is ridiculous!
- Then forget it.
No. I left after you went to bed!
- You don't have to explain.
- No, she bumped into me.
I was at the station.
Five guys'll swear it.
Hey, she borrows everything else of mine...
Of yours?
Did you say yours?
- That came out wrong.
- No, you said yours.
Forget it. You got your own rules, you play by your own game.
Rita, you and l, we see things different, we know that, but that don't have to be a bad thing, it just means we have a lot to learn from each other.
Now, look, I came here because
I got a line on those two John Does.
- Guess what?
- What?
They worked for Kitty Caprisi.
- The mob boss?
- Bingo.
Now, it's getting ready to rain.
Wanna get in the car?
Heads up, y'all. Hallelujah!
Get out of here, you piece of shit!
- You ain't got the balls, Guido.
- You made your point, Bear.
I could be a good stick-up man, Bear.
I'm the fucking best.
- Here's a hot piece of ass.
- You kiss your mama with that mouth?
I didn't know she was with somebody,
I'm sorry.
- Sorry for the trouble.
- Get out of here, man.
Andrew, could you do me a favour?
- Get the fuck out of here.
- I'm going, all right?
Bravo! You should get a Oscar for that shit, you the man, boy.
One minute you's you, then bam!
You're Al Sharpton!
- Like taking candy from a child.
- Can you teach me?
It takes a master vampire to transform oneself into a human, especially to absorb their thoughts - you have such messy minds.
Boss? I got an idea. Change into her partner. That'll fuck her head up.
There must first be a doorway of evil.
I've yet to discover such a thing with this man Justice.
Frankly, it's beginning to annoy me.
- Me, too.
- "Ristorante Italiano ".
Perfetto.
If one is to wine and dine a woman, he must know what to wine and dine her with.
- She's in there with that cop!
- And we're all going for a ride.
That's what I'm talking about!
Let's heat it up!
Rip off his head and shit down his neck, boss!
- Act like a vampire!
- Where did you get that?
Bloomingdale's. I broke the window and took it off the little white man.
I can use it more than he can. Look.
You're improvising. Very good.
You're turning into my best ghoul ever.
Get your fuckin' hands up, Sambo!
Move it!
- Move your ass!
- Take my hand, it's all I got.
Shove it up your ass, Meadowlark.
What are you, a magician?
- Give me your fucking wallet.
- Brooklyn...
- Come on!
- ...I love this place.
Jesus Christ. Oh, you fucking...!
- Holy shit!
- Dumbass.
They was making a pick-up on, let's just say some business proceeds.
- A pick-up from who?
- A punk numbers runner, name of Julius something or other.
I seen his girlfriend kick the living snot out of him once.
It's some big broad named Eva.
Lives on Court.
So you think this Julius could've iced your boys?
- Iced our boys?
- That putz couldn't ice tea!
He's almost as big a chickenshit as Guido.
Drop your shit on the floor.
Nobody be smart.
Put your fuckin' guns on the floor!
Come on, let's go! And you!
Empty the cash register right now!
Hurry up, do it!
OK, here we go.
Hey, there's a lot of fuckin' love in this room.
Speaking of which, do you believe in love at first sight?
- Get the hell away from me.
- Playing hard to get?
Lemme work on you. Watch it, Shaft,
I'll put a hole in your afro.
You're gonna be my new girlfriend.
Here we go. Is that register empty?
What's with this shit?
Get rid of this fuckin' garlic.
Garlic bread, signore?
The next person to offer a garlic product is gonna get one in the ass.
Tell that fuckin' cat to shut the fuck up or I'll whack him!
Easy, Sugar.
I'm starvin'. You want take-out?
What's your favourite pasta?
- Fusilli.
- Mine, too. We need pasta here!
Garlic boy, get us some fusilli, two to go.
- Move your ass!
- It's coming.
Fuckin' music is making my ears bleed. We need wine, too, honey.
- Red.
- Joey, red wine. Move your ass.
This place is making me itch.
Sugar!
The fuckin' cat had it coming, hissing and making claws...
- Mama mia!
- Son of a bitch, I'll kill him!
- I like cats.
- You should have said so, dollface.
Not so tight, Mr Tibbs.
- Hey, lover, you're coming with me.
- I'm going with her, OK? Let's go.
- Bear, who 's got the balls now, huh?
- Fuck you!
- You always gotta be the hero.
- It was an impulse, OK?
This guy had a .38 to your head, he could've killed you.
- It was a .45. I resent that.
- Shut up.
Hey, I know you. Didn't I see you at
Jugs on 5th Street, that titty bar?
- Shut up!
- Look, I brought him down.
- Why can't you give me that?
- Because he's an asshole!
- Shut up!
- You were out of line and you know damn well you should've waited for me.
She don't need you, Soul Train.
Tell him.
Shut up! Look, I was at the right place at the right time, no big deal!
The city of Brooklyn shall be judged as the city of Babylon!
It says here, "She bears a golden cup filled with her abominations
"and the filth of her fornications."
We are supposed to be partners, look out for one another,
- but you just don't get it, do you?
- Get what?
I care about you a little more than I'm supposed to but I can't help that.
Nikki! That's where I know you from!
Nikki from Bed-Stuy told me some cop named Justice beast-fucked her.
- You're the beast that fucked Nikki!
- Shut the fuck up!
It was you. You beast-fucked her.
You know you did it.
I don't know what he's talking about.
- Veder, in my office right now.
- You did good. He's an asshole.
He deserved every piece of palm that hit him.
Hey, take it easy.
What's the matter with you?
- Hey, police brutality!
- Do something with this fucker!
Soul Train, me and you right now, huh?
You been informed of your rights?
- Two days' suspension!
- What? Two days?
Yes, I've been informed of everything that I need to know.
Another nutcase. All right, move it.
Try and kill the cop.
Sinner! Sinner!
What is wrong with...?
He went that way.
Why don't you guys do a job, huh?
What are we doing on the floor?
Watch it!
- Idiot!
- Watch where you're going, lady!
Yeah, thanks.
Aw, jeez. Sunday drivers.
- Hey, you're...
- Mr Popular.
But my friends call me Max.
- Well, I'm...
- Rita. I remember.
I was just going by and you needed help.
You're bleeding.
You know, that's twice I owe you.
You always gotta be the hero?
I just happened to be in the right place at the right time, it's really no big deal.
Look, the bar thing...
- Oh, that was my fault.
- No.
I apologise.
My friend was drunk that night.
It was, really, it was one of those days, you know?
Kinda like today.
I understand.
I'm more of a night person myself.
Really? So am I.
I' d better get going.
I'm starving, too.
- Thanks. Good night.
- Good night.
Do you like Italian?
I make an ex cellent fusilli.
Actually, that's my favourite but I really think I ought to take a raincheck.
Oh. There's someone else.
Not any more.
If there's no one else, then
I would love to have you for dinner.
Look here. I'm a cop.
- The police.
- The law.
Which means if you try anything funny, I'll shoot you.
Do I look like I would bite you?
You better not.
Not after the day I've had.
Can I send my car to pick you up in a half hour?
Your car.
Well, then, let's make it an hour.
I'll see you then.
Look, Rita,
I got a few things I need to say cos this is real hard for me and... Shit.
I never said nothing like this before and I... Damn.
Look, I'm the man and I got a few things
I gotta set your ass straight on.
You're gonna do what I say do!
I must be crazy...
So what are you doing here?
I was just...
- Where are you going?
- Dinner.
Dinner? Dressed like that?
- Who you going with?
- A friend.
A girlfriend? I'm just saying, cos damn, you look good.
Can I give you a ride or something?
- I've got one, thanks.
- Damn, that's your ride?
- Miss Rita, good evening.
- Good evening.
Gotta go.
Oh, did you want something?
I... I was just gonna get a pizza and you know, I thought...
- Just have a good time, that's all.
- Thanks.
- Enjoy your dinner.
- Yeah. You, too.
You thought you was gonna get some ass tonight.
Take your ass to Blockbuster, get a video.
Pizza place.
Ain't no pizza place around here, you lyin' motherfucker.
See ya. Need to lighten up, stand there lookin' all mean.
Get your lyin' ass out of the street!
- Are you sure this is it?
- Yeah, that's it.
Right down that hall to the right.
A minute earlier, she' d have caught me casting every spell I knew on Julius's pigsty of an apartment but by the time she arrived
I had the place in reasonable shape, if I do say so myself.
Please ex cuse my building,
I just acquired it.
- This is incredible.
- No, you are. You look fabulous.
Thank you. I don't get to dress up too often.
That should change.
You like red wine?
- Yes. It's the only one I drink.
- Really? We share similar taste.
Van Gogh.
He's my favourite painter.
Have a closer look.
Is that the original?
Yes. He's my favourite, as well, so torn by visions that no one around him could appreciate.
I'm strangely drawn to his art.
It's sort of an outlet for me.
I know what you mean.
- It's beautiful.
- Yes, it is.
To the beauty...of the night.
Right here, I got it for you.
- Go away!
- Police officer.
Just wanna ask you a few questions, ma'am.
What are you trying to do, break my door down?
Show me your shield, not like it'll mean shit.
Just wanna ask about a friend, goofy-Iooking guy,
- numbers runner for Kitty Caprisi.
- Julius? He in trouble? Come on in.
I feel as if you know me.
We do have a lot in common, don't we?
Some things, yes, but you've been to so many places, you've seen so much, you've had such an ex citing life.
You might say that I've had several.
Sometimes I wonder what's out there, beyond the skyline, beyond Brooklyn, past everything I've ever known.
- There's no place you can't go.
- No place the subway doesn't run.
But what about your dreams, Rita?
Your dreams of another life?
And another world? Another you?
Everyone has those dreams.
You've a hunger never satisfied and a need never fulfilled.
God only knows what I need.
And I know.
You need to give me this drink... and give me your hand...
- and come dance with me.
- Oh, no.
- I'm not a good dancer.
- Come, please. Just one dance.
Come, come.
Oh, Max. This is crazy.
There's nothing wrong with being just a little crazy.
I've never danced like this before.
And now, you'll never stop.
I haven't felt like this since...
I've never felt like this.
How would you like to feel like this every night?
Is that a trick question?
To go to places you've never been?
- Yes.
- Drink the wine you've never tasted?
I can give it to you, Rita.
A world where no one laughs at you for what you feel, what you see, what you are.
All you have to do is just... say... say the word, say it.
- Looking for the girl?
- The girl? What girl?
You're a cop, you're supposed to remember faces.
The night watchman down at the dock?
Right. I'm also the proud landlord of this residential type place, so I do know who comes and I do know who goes.
I'm looking for a brother named Julius. Julius Jones.
Jones, Jones...
I knew a Latoya Jones once.
Called her Mrs Butterworth cos she had a ass flat like a pancake.
I haven't seen her around lately but I have seen your partner, yes I have.
You seen my partner?
Musta done some serious bumpin' last night with that cat.
- What cat?
- Some suave motherfucker.
New tenant. He's been tapping that top-shelf booty!
I'm talking bang-bang-bang!
When she walked out this morning, she was bow-legged.
- So you know where she went?
- I' d say she went home to sleep.
Course, she didn't get none last night. Bang-bang...
13 Fox, come in, over.
- Shit.
- Justice, where are you?
- 13 Fox, what's up?
- A DOA at Brooklyn City Hall.
Female, late twenties,
Captain requests you on the site.
- Hey, Connie.
- Hey.
God knows who or what got her up there.
Let me see that thing.
Looks like a bed sheet or something she's wrapped up in.
Shit!
Damn. Nikki.
If there's one thing a vampire has, it is patience, especially with those of his own kind.
But even that, in time, runs out and then in the family of darkness, blood will prove thicker than water can ever be.
Rita, wake up! Rita, wake up!
Damn, girl! I musta called here
50 times! Did you sleep all day?
I'm thirsty. What's going on?
What are you doing here?
It's about Nikki.
- Whatever happened between you...
- She's dead, Rita.
- What?
- But it's more than that.
The way she was hanging was exactly the way you painted it.
- No, it was just a dream.
- No, it's real.
Everything that you believed in and I didn't is real.
Justice, you saw her?
- Then somehow I'm not crazy.
- No.
No crazier than the rest of us.
Why me? Why is this happening to me?
I don't know... but we'll figure this out, together.
Now, we make mistakes and we have differences but... that's OK, we're only human, right?
- You know what you're doin'?
- No.
I'll make it up as I go.
I want this but...
Damn! Oh, damn!
Idiot!
Easy. Honey lamb, now ain't a good time to fuck with the man...
- Oh, shit, he got you too?
- I'll handle this.
I'll be in the kitchen.
- Want a cappuccino?
- Welcome home.
Do you still take red?
After last night, you'll want something with a little more bite.
- What have you done to me?
- Only what you asked.
- I didn't ask for this!
- No, but you wanted it.
You needed it and now you can feel it, look at you.
You feel more alive than you've ever been, stop fighting it.
- Death becomes you.
- It was you, wasn't it?
All the murders, the alley, the boat, Nikki.
It's a gift but you have it too,
I just unwrapped it for you.
- Gift?! Of what, death?
- Of life!
- I have given you eternal life!
- This isn't happening.
It's happening as we speak.
Can you feel it?
Come here! Listen. Listen to me!
Do you hear that? Do you hear it?
That is the sound of the night and it's calling.
Not to me. Not to me!
Women.
Frightening, isn't it?
Yes, you are.
I meant freedom to do anything you want, any time, anywhere.
I know it's terrifying at first.
I passed terrified about half an hour ago.
All your life you wondered why you felt things that no one else felt, why you never caught a cold, never broke a bone.
This is just a dream, right?
Soon I'm gonna wake up and...
And I will be there.
I'm not going to be alone again.
I' d perish without you.
I gotta go back, go back to my life, you can't stop me.
You can't.
Then go. Go back to your little shoe-box apartment filled with those empty dreams.
Go back to church and don't forget the collection, the preacher's whisky is running low.
Go back to your job!
Where they laugh and call you crazy!
Or you face the truth - that you have no place left to go but to me.
What do you know about truth?
You lied to me from the beginning.
- Your father sent me to you.
- What?
That's the truth. Your father.
If I had told you that when I first met you, if I had told you what you were, would you believe me if I told you that you were the daughter of a vampire?
- You're lying!
- You' d have loved your father.
Your mother did before they killed him.
Who? Who killed him? Who?
Humans! Humans fear what they don't understand and hate what they fear.
He sacrificed himself so your mother could live. It drove her insane.
But what if I don't want this?
What if you do?
What if you do?
Who 's there?
Step into the light.
- Detective Justice.
- You were expecting me?
You or the dark one, could have gone either way.
- Personally, I'm glad it's you.
- I need your help.
- Things have changed. Sit down.
- Rita has changed.
She's seeing things in her dreams.
- Now she's missing.
- What kind of dreams?
Nightmares. She paints them.
A girl was murdered and it was exactly the way Rita painted it.
And then...then I saw this.
This is the last one she did.
Then it's true there was a child.
I knew Rita's mother.
I was in love with her years ago.
She studied the vampires of my island. I was her guide.
I saw her succumb to the powers of the dark one and Rita is the result.
It's like, just clean my house,
I don't care if your kid's sick...
- Please don't.
- We must. Besides, she deserves it.
We must feed, Rita, or we die.
- Well, here's my shortcut.
- Bye-bye.
This one is the last.
He needs her.
He has to move very, very quickly.
- I'll kill him if he hurts her.
- You have to.
To save her, you must kill him before she abandons her humanity and feeds.
Much as she is human, she is now also a predator.
What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
I have pepper spray and I'll use it!
But I want you to know
I understand the Negro people.
You've been chained by the oppression of white capitalist society.
Yes, well... then you'll understand this!
Your turn, Rita. Taste her.
Taste her and quench the hunger.
- I won't do it!
- You don't have a choice!
No deposit, no return, no going back.
Help me.
I'm not going forward!
You can't run from your hunger!
There's no place you can hide!
Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil!
Help me!
- Where are you taking me?
- You need rest.
We have a long journey ahead.
- Where we going, boss?
- Home! While she rests, you pack.
We try to leave by dawn.
- Can I talk to you about my head?
- Drive!
Ready my coffin.
She don't look ready, she need a nap.
I'm readyin' the coffin cos we gettin' the fuck out of here.
Rita...my sweet.
- You must feed or you'll die.
- I want to die.
I won't let you.
I'll find someone for you.
Hey, hey, the Knicks won!
Julius, goddammit, you owe me $50!
Good God, he's a bad motherfucker.
Julius, where's my $50?
You ain't Julius.
You that cop's girl.
What's wrong, baby? You look sick.
Had too much pork, huh? Bad pig meat.
Want some cod liver oil?
Tell me what you need.
What she needs...
- is some fresh blood.
- Blood?
I'll go to the Red Cross, get all you need.
- Shut up!
- Hey, brother, what's the idea?
- The idea is dinner.
- Dinner? What we havin'?
- You.
- Me? Don't do it, baby.
- You don't have to resist. Do it!
- Don't! I got high blood pressure!
High as the motherfuckin' moon!
- Police! Police!
- It's OK.
- Police!
- Rita, it's over. Just walk away.
- Hey, coffin's all ready, B.
- Take care of that one.
I got him. All right, Supercop, you better get the fuck outta here or I'm gonna put this shit all over you.
- You better shut up.
- Oh, you're not afraid.
That's my fuckin' eye!
Come back here. Shit.
You're quite a bulldog but Rita belongs to me now.
Motherfuck you, man.
Shit.
The heart. This is my stomach.
This is my heart, this is my stomach.
You should know the rules, Zeko.
Not him.
Are you OK?
My leg! I think he broke my leg!
Fuck your leg, have you seen my eye?
Easy, B, I need my eye!
- Your eye?
- Came out of my head.
Oh, damn! Watch yo ' step, nigger!
You done mashed my shit all up!
- Coast clear?
- Yeah. Come on, give us a hand.
I gotta find a eye doctor.
I want y'all to get outta here and get him to a hospital.
- I'm not leaving without Rita.
- Remember the painting.
If she joins with him, she'll strike you next.
Let her go. Bitch tried to suck me like I'm a 40-ounce of malt liquor!
- Kill him.
- Thanks, Doc.
God is with you.
- I'll keep that in mind.
- You gonna need Him.
Come on.
We'll get you outta here too.
I ain't going.
My homey's taking care of me.
Have you seen yourself lately?
Let's get the hell out of here.
- Don't rip my shirt.
- Now, look at this shit!
That my arm!
- You put that back on!
- Now you're The Fugitive.
You put that back on!
I need this! You can't just snatch a brother's arm.
Right through your black heart!
You shouldn't have come.
It's too late for me.
Rita, we... Oh, shit! Look at you!
- Now it's too late for you.
- Still don't believe in vampires?
I'm taking Rita.
It's not too late for her.
You should be worried about yourself.
- Hey, bitch.
- Rita, get away from him!
I can give her everything!
Why deny her that?
She doesn't belong with you!
She's not a killer!
- It's in her blood!
- But not in her heart!
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure you're ugly.
Come, you bastard.
That's it! Goddammit! Idiot!
Get the fuck away from the knife.
Get... Come here!
Not in her heart, you say?
Why don't you ask her what she is?
I'm hungry.
- Tell him. Is his blood good enough?
- He'll do just fine.
Forget it, Justice. Time's up.
It's too late. It's much too late.
This is your destiny.
And yours.
- Take him.
- Part of me loves you so much... but that part of me must die.
It must die.
I told you that you were... a killer.
Come on, Rita, let's go. Come on!
Let's go!
We'll be OK!
Where did all...?
You did good, Rita. You OK?
Cross my heart... and hope to die.
- Come on, let's go.
- I'm with you, G.
I gotta find myself a safer job.
Like the bomb squad.
Hey, Unc, at least you got your health.
Well, thank you.
And at least you got your... well, you know, you got...
- you got a limo.
- That's right! I got a limo!
I got the front seat, now.
Let me drive.
No more drivin' the limo for me.
My little ass is in the back.
Unc, talk to me.
Cruise control, power steering, power brakes, power windows, power seats and we surrounded by leather.
Let's see what we got here.
Look at... Hey!
Some brother lost his mood ring.
Oh, shit. No.
No, man, this is Max's shit.
Max ain't gonna need this,
Max is spread out all over Brooklyn.
I'm gonna wear this in great Max's honour.
We gotta represent our homey the vampire.
- Hey, check it out. GQ or what?
- Macaroni.
Jesus, Mary, Little Bo Peep's Mom, what's wrong?
Ain't no smoking in the limo, Julius.
Good God Almighty.
You done flip-flopped!
Shit! Unc! I got my shit back, man.
I got my hand back,
I got my arm back,
I got jewels out the ass, look at these jewels.
Look at these fly shoes, man!
What?
Max said being a ghoul had benefits but goddamn!
I ain't no ghoul!
Welcome to the party.
Now, let's get this show on the road.
- Well, you the boss.
- That's right.
There's a new vampire in Brooklyn and his name's Julius Jones.
I ever tell you
I won the Indianapolis 500?
I beat a man called AJ Fittipaldi.
Yes, I used to dress like that in '62.
- They called me Pretty Willie.
- Pretty Willie, drive the limo!
Oh, goddamn, man.
Ripped by thewildbunch22
I busied myself to think of a story...
...which would speak to the mysterious fears of our nature...
...and awaken thrilling horror.
One to make the reader dread to look around.
To curdle the blood, and quicken the beatings of the heart.
Tell the captain, we've got to take in the topsail.
She's going to rip!
Please, captain!
We have to drop the sails!
All hands to the mast!
Take the wheel! Come on!
Captain, we've hit the ice!
We've hit the ice!
Iceberg ahead!
Hard to starboard!
Go back!
Help! Help!
-Help!
-Hold on, Vernon!
Hold on!
Put your backs into it, men!
Let's go!
Captain, this is useless.
The ice stretches for miles.
What do you suggest we do?
Lay down and die?
The men are exhausted, sir.
They can't go on, man.
I tell you, I have not come this far to give up now.
They knew the risk when they signed on.
And we are gonna chop our way to the North Pole if we have to.
Then you run the risk of mutiny, captain.
-Did you say mutiny?
-Yes I did, sir.
We proceed north as planned.
At the cost of how many more lives?
As many as it takes!
There's something out there.
What is it?
What the hell is that?
Who is your captain?
I am.
Who the devil are you?
I've no time to talk.
You bring your men and your weapons and follow me.
-Now!
-Stay where you are.
I give the orders here.
Get the dogs! Get them!
Leave them.
They're already dead.
Get back to the ship now!
Everybody back to the ship!
Bears don't kill like that, nothing does.
Maybe it wants the man with the captain.
-Or it wants the captain.
-The devil's come for the captain.
For the last time, I made my way from
St. Petersburg to Archangel on foot.
From there I took a whaling ship north.
When we hit the ice, I used the dogs.
What's out there?
Listen to me. I have spent six years planning this, my entire fortune.
I will not be stopped by you or some phantom.
Do you share my madness?
-No, not madness.
-What, then?
There's a passage to the North Pole, and I will find it.
At the cost of your own life?
The lives of your crew?
Lives come and go.
If we succeed, our names will live on forever.
I will be hailed as the benefactor of our species.
You're wrong.
I, of all men, know that.
Who are you?
My name...
...is Victor...
...Frankenstein.
Mother!
Oh, my wonderful son Victor!
You are the handsomest, kindest, cleverest...
...most wonderfulest boy in the whole world!
Madam! You will spoil the boy, really.
Would you two leave us, please,
Mrs. Moritz?
Doctor.
Come along, Justine.
Victor, this is Elizabeth.
She's coming to live with us.
She's lost both her mother and father to the scarlet fever, Victor.
She's an orphan now.
You must think of her as your own sister.
You must look after her, and be kind to her.
Always.
Mother, oh.
How is the imminent arrival?
Oh, a little frisky today.
When you were a little boy, you used to chase fireflies in the field.
Yes, and when I trapped them in my jar, they died.
-And do you remember how you cried?
-Yes.
Because you wanted to keep them glowing by your bedside...
...to light you as you read.
You were so hungry for knowledge.
Such a serious little boy.
You've become such an earnest young man.
All these strange and ancient books.
You'll be an even greater doctor than your father.
But you know, Victor, life shouldn't be all study.
There's such fun to be had.
-Give me that back.
-No.
Give me that back, Mother.
Change partners. And twirl!
-Now, Caroline.
-You're right.
-You mustn't exert yourself. Please.
-I know.
Don't worry, madam. Your new baby will be a natural dancer.
Excellent.
You'll be the envy of all the young ladies and gentlemen.
Justine.
Justine, may I have this dance?
-Madam!
-Hurry!
You must make a decision!
How can I?
The baby's in the wrong position.
I can't proceed.... I can't....
Cut me. Save the baby.
She'll be all right.
Your father's the finest doctor in Geneva.
Father?
Father?
Father, how is she?
I did everything I could....
Everything I could....
Mother? Mother!
Bring her back.
Please, bring her back.
No!
Please, bring her back.
Oh, Mother.
You should never have died.
No one need ever die.
I will stop this.
I will stop this.
I promise.
Victor, you're completely obsessed.
Please explain what that is.
It's energy. It never disappears, it merely changes form.
It's possible to convert this candle wax...
...into the convulsions of a mechanical dog.
But the applications of this are limitless. Really.
Oh, please come outside, Victor.
It's such a beautiful day.
Go away, I'm busy.
What's this?
It's for spraying down the electric eels.
Now, put it down. Put it down.
It's not for playing with.
It's not for playing with. Put it down, put it down-- Don't do that.
I warned you. Don't-- Don't--
Give me that, you little....
Come on!
Come on!
We should be grateful to Victor...
...for abandoning his experiments for one afternoon.
Well, who says I have?
What do you mean?
Look!
We're all going to die.
-You knew this would happen.
-Not for certain.
But I had hoped the conditions would be right. They're common here.
I've never seen one quite as large, though. Look.
-Isn't it wonderful?
-Victor, you shouldn't have done this.
It's all right, it's all right.
-We must take cover. A tree!
-That's exactly the wrong thing to do.
It's a much larger conductor than we are.
Victor, what about Willie?
-What are we to do?
-Come on.
Spread out.
Elizabeth, take this. Now, quickly.
-Come on, quickly!
-What is that?
Dig it right into the ground. Go ahead.
-Now what?
-Justine, take this. Come on.
-Willie!
-Everyone down.
Give me your hands. It'll be fine.
Now take him. Now, that's good.
I hope you know what you're doing.
-Willie? Willie, don't look up!
-Willie.
-Victor--
-Wait!
One, two, three....
Now.
So how do you feel, Elizabeth?
Alive.
Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends.
Gather round and listen.
As you probably know, tomorrow my dear son Victor...
...leaves me to pursue, what I'm sure...
...will be an illustrious career in a profession...
...I am not altogether unassociated with.
Oh, modesty.
My one regret is that his mother...
...my late wife, is not here...
...to share the pride...
...which our son fills me with tonight.
Yes.
She wanted you to have this, Victor.
On your graduation.
And in it she has written:
"This is the journal of Victor Frankenstein."
The rest of the leaves are blank...
...to be filled with the deeds of a noble life.
We'd better go in, before they miss us.
Just a little while longer. Please.
I don't know when we'll be alone together again.
Oh, dear Victor.
I shall miss you laughing at me.
I'll miss you making me laugh.
So how do brothers and sisters say goodbye?
Perhaps they never have to.
I won't, if you won't.
Are you my sister?
Sister...
...friend...
...lover.
Wife?
Yes.
Then come with me to Ingolstadt.
Marry me now.
-Victor, no.
-Well, then I'll stay.
I want more than anything else in the world to be your wife.
But as long as you're away,
I belong here.
I want to make this house live again.
I want to make this a great home for our children.
And now you must go, and do the great things you need to do.
I want you so much.
I'll be here when you return.
Each holiday. Every visit.
Then on our wedding night.
Until our wedding night.
Lots of stairs, I'm afraid.
-How was your journey?
-Good, thanks. I made good progress...
-...over the mountains.
-I am pleased.
-As I said, we've only got attic space.
-It's exactly what I'm looking for.
But Frau Brach, there will be a great deal...
...of scientific equipment and rigging to be delivered.
Every day, for the next week.
I trust you have no objections.
I'm sure you appreciate the need for a proper laboratory.
Oh, Putzi likes you.
This will be perfect.
"The foolish and vain force their views by the rod.
But knowledge is power only through God."
Our motto. Easily forgotten by you young men in a hurry.
But perhaps the greatest mistake that all students make...
...during their time here, is to suppose...
...that they can ever have an original or creative thought.
We have all imagined that in our time.
But gentlemen, you have not come here in order to think for yourselves.
You are here to learn how to think for your patients.
You must learn, therefore, in the first place...
...to submit yourselves...
...to the established laws of physical reality.
But surely, professor...
...you don't intend we disregard more philosophical approaches?
Philosophical?
Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect, as in Paracelsus.
Paracelsus.
An arrogant and foolish Swiss.
Albertus Magnus?
His nonsense was exploded
500 years ago.
Cornelius Agrippa?
A sorcerer. An occultist.
What is your name?
Victor Frankenstein, sir. Of Geneva.
Another Swiss.
Mr. Frankenstein, here at the University of Ingolstadt, we teach--
And indeed, hope to advance.
--the science of medicine.
Chemistry, biology, physics.
We study hard science.
Surely, the greatest possible advances lie in combining these things.
We do not study the ravings of lunatics and alchemists...
...hundreds of years in their graves...
...because their kind of amateur, fanatical, fantastical speculation...
...does not heal bodies or save lives.
Only science can do that.
Now, have we your permission to continue?
-Nice coat.
-Why, thank you.
Don't take it too hard.
Krempe doesn't approve of public humiliation.
-I am not mad!
-My dear fellow, of course you're not.
In fact, that's just what I'd expect a perfectly rational person...
...to say to a complete stranger.
Henry Clerval, by the way, and I'm completely crazy.
-Victor Frankenstein.
-Of Geneva.
-Of Geneva.
-Yes, I noti--
Why don't you look where I'm going?
That's Schiller.
Ornament of the playing field.
-Really.
-He's new as well.
You can tell because he goes around looking at things with his mouth open.
What are you here for?
-Research.
-Very grand.
I'm here to become a mere doctor.
I'm told it has something to do with healing the sick.
Which is a pity, really, because
I find sick people rather revolting.
Still, I'll have a good time, get my degree--
If I can stop failing Anatomy.
--and settle down to relieve rich old ladies of their imaginary ailments...
...and then relieve their very real and beautiful daughters.
-Who was that? He was at the lecture.
-That's Waldman.
-That's Waldman.
-Yes.
Interesting case.
They say in his youth...
...he could break into heaven and lecture God on science.
Ran into trouble with the authorities years back.
Something to do with illegal experiments.
But what kind of experiments,
I wonder?
So what was it you were saying?
Rich old ladies and their daughters?
Yes, it's a life of sacrifice, I know, but someone's got to do it.
And that is why the central nervous system...
...and its crowning achievement, the brain...
...are as complicated and mysterious a set of organs...
...as you are ever likely to encounter.
Mr. Frankenstein, the incision is yours.
Excellent.
Mr. Clerval, you may remove the cranial lid.
"Henry, now fully recovered, continues his struggle to pass Anatomy."
I was always terrible at anatomy.
"Professor Waldman is very tolerant of us. I'm learning a great deal."
-Professor Waldman is remarkable.
-And so is Henry.
"God bless you, all my love, Victor."
-That's very nice.
-"P.S. I've fallen in love."
I beg your pardon?
"She's dark, sleek, and beautiful...
...and always wags her tail whenever she sees me.
Her name is Putzi, and she's the friendliest sheepdog that I've known."
"P.S. Elizabeth,
I dream of how your hair shines...."
"Of how your lips taste.
I dream of your arms and breasts...
...and of the time on our wedding night...
...when we will be alone together at last."
What else does it say?
It says, "I'm working very hard to make lots of new friends."
More coffee, anyone?
Once and for all, Frankenstein!
Life is life, death is death.
These things are real.
-They are absolute.
-That is rubbish and you know it!
That premise has been repeatedly challenged by your own staff!
Yes, you, sir! We don't know where life ends or death begins.
Hair continues to grow after what we choose to call death. So do fingernails.
We know that a man's brain may die...
...but his heart and lungs may continue to pump and breathe.
Now, you know that.
Mr. Frankenstein of Geneva,
I warn you...
...what you are suggesting is not only illegal, it is immoral.
Rubbish!
"Dear diary, why does no one understand me? P.S. I am not mad."
You.
-Explain yourself.
-Professor, I'm sorry.
Listen, I came here to learn all about the new science.
About galvanism,
Franklin's experiments.
Combination of modern disciplines with ancient knowledge...
-...to protect and create--
-To create what?
Sir, we can change things. We can make things better. You know that.
We are on the verge of undreamed-of discoveries...
...if we only have the courage to ask the right questions. You must help me.
Come on.
-Victor....
-Come on.
Henry.
Lock the door.
Now, for thousands of years...
...the Chinese have based their medical science on the belief...
...that the human body is a chemical engine run by energy streams.
-Fascinating. How do they explain--?
-Don't touch that!
Their doctors treat patients...
...by inserting needles like these into the flesh...
...at various key points, to manipulate these electric streams.
I see.
So electricity is the key.
Now, look at this.
Go on, touch it.
-It feels warm.
-It is.
Yes. How do you do?
Turn it off!
-I can't, it's not working.
-Try to stay calm, Henry.
Simply a matter of reducing the polarity.
A monkey's arm is basically the same as ours.
-No arm is this strong!
-Now, this must work.
Let me help you, professor.
You shall, of course, tell no one.
They wouldn't believe you anyway.
Dearest Victor.
Nothing much changes here.
Mrs. Moritz continues to love and torment Justine, in equal measure.
Willie grows more precocious every day...
...and Father almost expires with pride...
...at the very thought of you and your work.
And I....
Well, I just miss you, very much.
Please write soon, Victor.
No, I'm serious.
You take vaccine, for instance.
Thirty years ago the entire concept of vaccine was unheard of...
...and now we save lives every day.
-But that isn't the whole answer.
-What do you mean?
That sooner or later the best way to cheat death will be to create life.
Now you've gone too far.
-There's only one God, Victor.
-No, leave God out of it.
If you loved someone, they had a sick heart...
...wouldn't you give them a healthy one? It's not impossible.
We can do it, we're steps away.
If we can replace one part of a human, we can replace every part.
And if we do that, we can design a life.
We can create a being that will not grow old or sicken.
One that's stronger than us, better than us.
One more intelligent than us, more civilized than us.
-In our lifetime?
-No.
How close did you get, professor?
Too close.
Professor, I beg you, let me see these notes.
No. My work now, and its application...
...lies exclusively in the preservation of life.
I abandoned my other researches many years ago.
Why?
Because they resulted in abomination.
You're not sticking that in me.
It's got a pox in it, I hear.
-Pox? They've given us pox?
-Pox.
It's not pox, it's a vaccine that will prevent plague in this city.
-What's that?
-It's a tiny, harmless amount...
-...of anti-smallpox serum.
-You just said pox!
I said it was harmless.
It's a necessary precaution, without which this godforsaken city...
...would be immediately put under quarantine.
You doctors kill. I don't care what you say. You're not sticking that in me.
Yes, I am. It's the law!
-Sit him down, someone.
-You're not sticking that in me!
You're not sticking that in me!
-Sir?
-Professor? Sir?
Find him!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
It's no use, Victor, he's gone.
-No! No, Henry!
-Let him go!
-No! No, this shouldn't happen!
-Let him go! Victor, stop!
-It shouldn't happen!
-Stop!
It need not happen!
The hell with you!
Whatever you say, whatever you call it, you doctors are killers.
You murder people!
Evil! You're evil!
Evil!
You're the ones that deserve to die.
God will punish you. He'll punish you!
God will punish you!
My God, you were so close!
Of course, the power!
The materials were wrong.
You needed auxiliary sources.
"The experiment a failure.
Resulting reanimant malformed and hideous to behold.
This factor dependant on the appropriate raw materials."
Raw materials....
-Come on, Henry.
-I can't help you, Victor.
-You won't. What are you afraid of?
-Everything! What if the authorities--?
We'll do this in secret. I've got the raw materials, I've got Waldman's journals.
-You stole his journals?
-We owe it to him to complete this.
-He was one step away.
-He never wanted this.
Couldn't face it, that's different.
Even if it were possible, and even if you had the right--
Which you don't.
--to make this decision for us...
...can you imagine there wouldn't be a terrible price to pay?
I think for the chance to defeat death and disease...
...to let everyone on Earth have the chance at life...
...sustained, healthy life...
...to allow people who love each other to be together forever....
For all of that,
I think it's a risk worth taking.
Please, Justine, just leave me alone.
I won't talk about it.
But all these letters, you read them to us every week.
I wrote them. I wrote the letters.
He hasn't written to me in months.
Elizabeth....
Something horrific is happening to him. I can feel it.
At first I wasn't sure, but I knew I had to hide it from Father.
Now there are rumors of cholera.
I can look after Father and Willie.
You go to Ingolstadt--
That's not possible. He won't want me.
He's probably found someone else.
If he was mine,
I would have gone already.
But he isn't mine.
He's yours, and you must go to him.
Raw materials, that's all they are.
Tissue to be re-used.
The very finest brain.
-But they all died of cholera, sir.
-No matter.
Thank you.
The assembled organs must have the appropriate nutrients and heat...
...and crucially, more direct power.
More direct power.
Amniotic fluid is the chief biogenic element.
The subject is injected with this.
The copper acupuncture needles...
...are inserted at key energy points.
Now, after the removal of current, the dead toad should retain animation.
But independently of external power sources.
Yes.
That's it.
That's the combination.
That's the combination!
That's it!
Victor? Victor!
Victor, open the door!
-Victor, please!
-What do you want?
There's cholera. It's an epidemic!
The city's been placed under martial law.
-Are you listening to me, Victor?
-Yes. And?
The militia's arriving to quarantine the city.
Most of us are getting out while we still can.
Krempe knows you're here.
What if he tells the authorities?
Goodbye, Henry.
Victor, it's me.
Elizabeth.
Can you hear me?
Victor, I have to see you.
-Go away.
-Please, Victor!
I won't leave here until you see me.
Come in the side door.
Alone!
What's happened to you?
How can you live here like this?
And that stench.
Don't go in there!
-We have to leave. It isn't safe.
-No, I have to stay.
-Even if it means you'll die?
-Yes.
Well, let me help you.
No, that's impossible.
We made a promise.
Victor, I beg you.
Look, I know that this is difficult for you to understand...
...but I cannot abandon this work now.
It is too important. Not just for me, but, believe me, for everyone.
And it must come first.
Before us?
Elizabeth...
...I love you so much, but....
Goodbye.
Elizabeth! Elizabeth!
Oh, God! Elizabeth!
Elizabeth!
Live! Live! Live!
Live!
Yes!
No....
No!
No!
No!
No!
It's alive.
It's alive.
No.
What have I done?
What have I done?
"Massive birth defects.
Greatly enhanced physical strength.
But resulting reanimant...
...is malfunctional...
...and pitiful...
...and dead."
Tomorrow this journal and its secrets must be destroyed...
...forever.
Oh, God.
No!
You fool,
Victor Frankenstein of Geneva.
How could you know what you'd unleashed?
How is it pieced together?
Bits of thieves, bits of murderers....
Evil stitched to evil stitched to evil.
Do you really believe this thing will thank you for its monstrous birth?
Evil will have its revenge.
God help your loved ones.
What do you think you're doing?
He's got cholera! He's the one who's been spreading the plague!
Get him!
Come here, you--
Keep away from him.
No, kill him now!
He went this way.
There now. Easy. Easy. Just a bit.
-That's it. There, now, rest easy.
-Henry, you're here.
Of course I'm here.
It was touch and go with you, though.
I feared cholera, turned out to be pneumonia.
Yes, I'm becoming something of a doctor.
Even Krempe seems pleased with me.
At this rate,
I might even pass Anatomy.
-The epidemic?
-Dreadful.
There's nothing we can do for them.
The vulnerable, anyone who's without shelter or food...
...the newborns, especially, will die.
-Are you sure?
-I'm certain of it.
Thank God.
What do you mean?
Nothing.
Well then, that's my shift finished.
I'll see you later.
Elizabeth.
Elizabeth.
-Please, please, forgive me!
-Of course I do.
Victor, I don't know what you're working on, and I don't want to know.
But it nearly killed you.
It's over, it's finished.
It should never have started.
It's dead! It's dead.
-Felix!
-Yes?
Don't forget the onion scraps.
All right, I've got them.
Go on, get.
Come on. Come on.
Go on, go on. Go on. Get.
-How are the pigs?
-Happy they've been fed.
-How are your hands?
-They're bleeding again.
Let me see them.
That's better.
There.
-The soup's ready.
-Come on, Grandpa. Sit down.
Thank you.
We'll never get through the winter with this yield.
-The ground's frozen hard.
-We'll sell another pig at market.
We can't.
Not until they lift the quarantine.
Even then, it's one less for us. Last month's rent, he'll be back for that.
Come on. We'll do this together.
You're right.
We've got to, before the snow comes.
Come on, then.
The ground's frozen solid. We'd need
20 men to do this. It's useless!
-It's getting late.
-We don't have enough to eat.
We'll manage. Let's go.
Look. Look.
They must be gifts from the Good Spirit of the Forest.
Father, nothing in this life comes free of cost.
-I would like to know who and why.
-Was it the Good Spirit, Grandpa?
-I believe it was.
-Don't fill their head with nonsense.
Who's there?
Felix? Children?
Right.
What's this one?
-Friend?
-Friend! Well done!
That's very good.
You've got lots of friends, haven't you? Grandpa and....
Friend....
Friend....
Friend.
Friend.
Family.
Father.
You must travel with them for the entire journey.
This equipment must not be left unattended.
My father will take delivery of them in Geneva. Understand?
I do, sir.
-Going somewhere?
-Henry, look.
Look at this locket Victor gave me.
Isn’t it beautiful?
-Yes, it's lovely. Is this really you?
-Yes, it's a bad likeness, I know.
But for now, it will serve instead of a ring.
Congratulations on the entirely expected!
-When?
-As soon as we get home.
We'll be there for New Year's Eve.
-He's taking over Father's practice.
-And expanding it.
I'm going on ahead now the quarantine's lifted. So much to do.
Now, the practice needs a partner.
Now, there's not much money...
...but there is food and board and some very good company.
And it's the ideal position for someone who has finally passed Anatomy.
So we were wondering if...
...there was anybody that you could recommend?
Victor, I-- I don't know what to say.
Well, please say yes.
-Yes.
-Yes!
-Yes!
-Yes, yes!
And you can write that down in your journal!
"This is...
...the journal...
...of...
...Victor...
...Frankenstein...
...of...
...Geneva."
Come on, quickly.
Come on, then, off you go.
Quickly, now.
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.
Come on, now. Come on.
Time for bed.
In you go.
"For the Good Spirit of the Forest."
Are you the Good Spirit of the Forest?
Not exactly. Where's your father?
I said, where's your father?
Who's there? Maggie?
-No.
-Oh, it's you.
-What have you done to Maggie?
-Is he in there?
Hiding behind a blind old man?
Get away! Get away!
Don't blame me.
Blame your son for not paying his rent on time.
My God.
Thank you, my friend.
Thank you so much.
Won't you come and sit by the fire?
Please, don't be afraid.
Come. Come in.
Have a rest, sit down.
That's better.
I'm glad you finally came in.
A man shouldn't have to hide in the shadows.
Better that way, for me.
Why?
People are afraid.
Except you.
It can't be as bad as that.
Worse.
I can "see" you with my hands, if you'll trust me.
-Papa, Papa, he hurt Grandpa!
-Who hurt Grandpa?
-What was that noise?
-Tell me what the noise was.
What happened, Maggie?
Poor man.
Have you no friends?
There are some people.
But they don't know me.
Why do you not go to them?
Because I am so very...
...ugly.
And they are so very...
...beautiful.
Father! Get out of here!
-Get out of here, monster.
-Leave him alone!
We have to leave here.
No.
I will have revenge!
Frankenstein!
Geneva.
-Quickly, quickly.
-She's here, she's here!
-Willie!
-We got your letter!
It's the first one
I was allowed to read.
Congratulations, Elizabeth.
-I'm happy for you.
-Thank you, Justine.
Oh, is that the locket?
Look how handsome Victor is.
-Can I take this to show Peter?
-Yes, but, Willie, it's not a toy.
Let him go.
Don't dawdle, William!
Justine, you idiot. Pay attention.
Anyone would think you're the one that's getting married.
-Yes, Mother.
-What's wrong?
Nothing. Really.
Just leave it. You've ruined it now.
No! No!
Frankenstein.
You, with me.
-Have you seen Willie?
-Isn’t he back yet?
Claude went to find if he'd lost track of time.
-They say he never arrived.
-Far too late for him to still be out.
-William!
-William!
-William!
-William!
Willie!
Willie!
Willie....
Willie!
This isn't a game!
Willie!
It's so late.
We're all so tired. I'm so tired.
Father! I'm so pleased to see you.
What's wrong?
William!
We checked the east ridge.
There's nothing there.
Damn!
Elizabeth?
I found him!
I found him!
Elizabeth!
No!
We did everything we could, sir.
You just rest easy now.
We did everything we could.
Sir, I'm terrified for my girl.
She's still out looking for William.
We parted badly. I was cruel to her.
I didn't mean it.
I think she finds it hard, with your wedding. She loves you dearly.
I couldn't bear it if anything happened to her.
She's all I've got. Please, help me!
We'll organize another search now that it's light.
We will find her, Mrs. Moritz,
I promise.
-How is Father?
-His heart is breaking.
Mr. Frankenstein...
...we've apprehended the murderer, five miles from here hiding in a barn.
We found this on her.
It's yours, I believe, sir?
Sir, you must come immediately.
The townspeople have gone mad.
-What are they doing?
-They must have broken into the jail!
For God's sake, can't you stop them?
They've gone wild!
This is a lynching mob!
Stop! This is unlawful.
-Justine.
-Justine!
Victor! Help me!
I was trying to find him!
I went to the lake, but it was dark!
I wanted to bring him to you!
He must be there for the wedding!
I'm sorry! He's so tiny.
We managed to close the gates on the mob, Claude.
What about Justine?
We've cut her down.
We can bury her in the morning.
Thank you, Claude. Get to bed.
The sea of ice.
I will meet you there...
...on the sea of ice.
Oh, Justine, forgive me.
Victor, tell me. Who is this man?
How do you know he's responsible?
I'll tell you everything after I destroy him.
This is a matter for the police.
They wouldn't understand.
Well, neither do I.
Then just accept it.
Get up.
Get up.
You do speak.
Yes, I speak.
And read.
And think.
And know the ways of man.
How did you find me?
Your journal.
Then you mean to kill me.
No.
You murdered my brother, didn't you?
I took him by the throat with one hand...
...lifted him off the ground...
...and slowly crushed his neck.
And as I killed him,
I saw your face.
You gave me these emotions. But you didn't tell me how to use them.
Now two people are dead...
...because of us.
Why?
There's something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
What of my soul? Do I have one?
Or was that a part you left out?
Who were these people of which I am comprised?
Good people? Bad people?
-Materials, nothing more.
-You're wrong.
Do you know
I knew how to play this?
In which part of me did this knowledge reside?
In these hands?
In this mind? In this heart?
And reading and speaking.
Not things learned, so much as things remembered.
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
Did you ever consider the consequences of your actions?
You gave me life, and then you left me to die.
Who am I?
You....
I don't know.
And you think I'm evil.
What can I do?
There is something I want. A friend.
A friend?
Companion.
A female.
Someone like me.
So she won't hate me.
Like you?
Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
I do know that...
...for the sympathy of one living being...
...I would make peace with all.
I have love in me the likes of which...
...you can scarcely imagine.
And rage, the likes of which you would not believe.
If I cannot satisfy the one...
...I will indulge the other.
And if I consent, how will you live?
We would travel north, my bride and I...
...to the furthest reaches of the Pole.
Where no man has ever set foot.
There, we would live out our lives...
...together.
No human eye would ever see us again.
This, I vow.
You must help me. Please.
If it is possible to right this wrong...
...then I will do it.
-Victor!
-Victor.
Are you all right?
-Yes, I'm safe. I'm safe.
-What happened?
Tell us.
Victor.
Victor, you have to tell us what happened!
One month, that's all I ask.
And then we can be married and we can forget this whole business.
-I promise.
-Promise? Promise.
Oh, don't dare use that word to me.
You promised to tell me who this man was. You promised to stop this work.
-Your promises mean nothing.
-Elizabeth.
-I have to leave this house.
-Where will you go?
-Somewhere I can recover.
-This is ridiculous.
I haven't got time to argue.
Oh, isn't it convenient?
Or doesn't it fit in with your plans?
Don't you ever think of anyone or anything but yourself?
God forgive me.
Why her?
Materials, remember? Nothing more.
-Your words.
-No.
You will honor your promise to me!
I will not.
Go on, kill me now.
That is mild compared to what will come.
If you deny me my wedding night,
I will be with you on yours.
Elizabeth!
Elizabeth.
Wait. Wait, please wait. Please.
I have to speak to you. Please!
What do you want to say?
Don't go.
Please, don't go.
I'm frightened.
Of what?
I have done something so terrible...
...so evil.
And I'm frightened that if I tell you the truth...
...that I will lose you.
You'll lose me if you don't.
I...
...don't know...
...what...
...to do.
Will you marry me, Victor?
Marry me today.
Tomorrow, tell me everything.
But you must tell me the truth.
And together, we can face anything.
Whatever you've done, whatever has happened...
...I love you.
To share the truth, the whole truth, for good or ill...
...to stand by each other in sickness and in health...
...and in joy, from this day forward...
...till death do you part.
Who is this man, sir?
-How shall we know him?
-Believe me, you'll know him.
He killed Master William, and Justine Moritz died for it.
No hesitation, lads.
Shoot the bastard on sight!
Henry?
Don't worry about a thing.
You two look after each other.
I'll look after your father.
I'm sorry, sir. The last ferry's gone.
There's nothing now till morning.
-Damn.
-I'll secure you lodgings for the night.
-Thank you, Claude.
-Come on.
-Keep your pistols dry!
-They're dry enough.
And if they fail, we've others.
And if those fail...
...we can always gut the bastard.
-Go to your post.
-Yes, sir.
Don't worry, sir.
You're well guarded.
Now, why don't you go on upstairs to your wife?
It's not often a man has his wedding night.
You're soaking.
Brother and sister no more.
Now husband and wife.
Victor?
Lock the door.
-Lock the door.
-Victor.
I saw him in a flash of lightning.
He ran to the lake.
You two stay here.
We lost him.
Elizabeth!
Don't bother to scream.
Please.... Please don't hurt me.
You are lovelier than
I ever could have imagined.
Elizabeth!
Elizabeth!
I keep my promises!
For God's sake, tell me what happened.
No point. I know what I have to do.
God. No, Victor! You can't do this,
I won't let you!
She's gone. I love her.
What would you do?
Leave her in peace.
My father would have done this for my mother.
Your father's dead.
Then there's nothing left to lose.
Nothing but your soul.
Live!
No!
Live. Live.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Say my name.
Please, say my name.
Remember! You must remember.
Elizabeth?
Elizabeth?
That's it.
That's it, you remember.
That's it.
Now, stand. Stand.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
You remember.
You remember.
She's beautiful.
She's not for you.
Come.
Elizabeth?
Say my name.
Elizabeth.
Yes.
Elizabeth!
You're beautiful.
Say my name.
Elizabeth, come to me.
Come to me.
Say my name, Elizabeth.
Vic....
That's right, Elizabeth.
Victor.
No, you're mine.
You're mine.
-Leave her alone! No!
-Get away from her. She's mine.
She's mine! She said my name!
She remembers!
She's mine!
No!
All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave...
...by my hand.
I followed the trail he left for me--
North.
Always north.
--for months now...
...with one intent:
To kill him.
Now...
...I'm tired.
I'm so very, very tired.
What did he say?
He's dead.
He died raving about some phantom.
What is it out there, captain?
He told me a story that...
...couldn't be true.
He was mad, I think.
A warming breeze.
-The ice will melt yet.
-And what then, captain?
-We head north.
-No.
Who are you?
He never gave me a name.
Why do you weep?
He was my father.
"And yea, I gave my heart to know wisdom...
...and to know madness and folly...
...and I perceived that all is vanity and vexation of spirit.
For in much wisdom is much grief...
...and he that increaseth knowledge, increaseth sorrow.
For God shall bring every work and every secret thing into judgment...
...whether it be good, or whether it be evil."
-Captain--
-He has a right to bear witness.
Jesus, it's breaking up!
Get back to the ship, captain.
Leave the damn torch! Leave it!
Come with us.
I am done with man.
Hang on, I've got you!
Help! Help!
Here, captain. Here, captain.
Quick, grab my hand!
Where to now, captain?
Home.
Claire.
I miss you.
Dr. Weir report te the Lewis & Clark in Docking Bay 4.
- Ion drive set.
- Thank you.
Heading: Vector One, nine degrees.
We are prepped for lockdown.
I can't believe it, this is ridiculous.
I haven't got more than my hand in the last six weeks, and now this shit.
I mean, why can't we go to Mars, Captain?
- I mean, Mars has got women.
- Smith's right.
Neptune, there's nothing out there.
Yeah, and if the shit goes down, we'll be on our own.
You know the rules, people.
Someone drops the ball, we get the call.
Now, let's go.
- Have you got our course plotted in?
- Yes, sir.
- Locked and cocked and ready to rock.
- Mr. Justin?
Everything's green on my screen,
Skipper.
Start your countdown now.
Ion drive will engage in T minus 10 minutes.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Let's go.
- Smith, you follow me.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Justin, get those tanks prepped.
- Yes, sir.
- Mr. Cooper.
- Skipper.
- Ion drive in 10 minutes.
- It's time to play spam-in-the-can.
- Skipper.
- Peters.
Captain Miller,
I just wanted to say this is something...
Clock is ticking, Doctor.
You waiting for a personal invitation, there, Mr. Smith?
- No, sir.
- Captain, I don't want to take up...
Doctor, if you'll just follow the rest of the crew to the grav tanks, we're almost underway.
That bunk better be squared away,
Mr. Cooper, or you'll find yourself walking to Neptune.
What's the hold-up, Peters?
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers, sir.
You stand right here.
Thanks, D.J.
- Hats off in the tank.
- Sir.
- First time in a grav couch?
- Yeah.
I think your captain has some kind of a problem with me.
Oh, well. Don't worry about him.
He just loves having complete strangers on his ship.
- D.J.
- Yeah.
No.
Is this necessary?
When the ion drive fires, you'll be taking about 30 G's.
Without a tank, the force would liquety your skeleton.
I've seen the effect on mice.
Claustrophobic?
Very.
Biiiy.
I'm so aione.
Hello?
Is anyone there?
Oh, God.
Biiiy?
I'm so coid.
Claire.
I'm waiting.
You're all right. Breathe. D.J.!
- Okay, Dr. Weir, let's get you up.
- Okay, I'm fine.
- Come on, take it easy.
- I'm fine.
Okay. There you go.
Now move nice and slow.
You've been in stasis for 56 days.
You're gonna experience a little disorientation, you understand?
- I'm all right now, thank you.
- Okay, take that. Don't rush it.
All yours.
You okay, Doc?
- Want some coffee?
- What?
Would you like some coffee?
No. Thank you.
All right, suit yourself.
What about you, Starck?
Would you like something hot and black inside you?
- Is that an offer?
- It is not.
- Then how about some coffee?
- Starck?
- Yes, sir.
- Why aren't you on the bridge?
Do you mind if I get dressed first?
As a matter of fact, Lieutenant,
I do mind if you get dressed first.
Let's go, people. We have a job to do.
Okay, Denny, here we go.
Happy birthday.
Piay horsey, Mommy. Piay horsey.
Hey, no more ball in the house.
You're the one who can't catch.
- Yo, apologize.
- Sorry about that, Mama Bear.
- All right.
- All right, then.
- Peters.
- Yes, sir.
I did try to find a replacement for you, but with such short notice, it was impossible.
I am sorry.
I talked to my ex.
He's going to take Denny for Christmas.
I'll get him for the summer, so everything's all right.
Smitty.
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, in approximately
2 hours and 23 minutes, we'll be arriving in the orbit of Neptune.
Thank you very much.
- I thank you.
- That's good.
All boards are green.
Everything's five by five.
- U.S.A.C. Been notified of our position?
- Yes, sir.
- All right, people, listen up.
- D.J.
As you all know, we have an addition to our crew.
Dr. Weir, you care to join us?
Introductions all around.
This is my XO, Lieutenant Starck.
Mr. Justin, Engineering.
The funky spaceman over here is Mr. Cooper.
What exactly is it you do on board this ship, Coop?
Listen up, Doc,
I'm your best friend, okay?
I am the lifesaver and the heartbreaker.
He's a rescue technician.
This is Peters, medical technician.
And my pilot, Mr. Smith.
The gloomy Gus in the corner over there, that's...
D.J. Trauma.
All right, all right.
Now we all know each other.
Skipper, I got a question.
What the fuck are we doing way out here?
Perhaps the good doctor will be kind enough to tell us.
Thank you.
First of all,
I want to say how much I appreciate
- this opportunity to join you on what I...
- It's for sure that you appreciate being here, Doctor, but you must understand that we don't.
We were taken off a well-deserved leave and sent into Neptune space.
We are now three billion klicks from the nearest outpost.
The last time U.S.A.C. Attempted a rescue this far past the outer reach, well, we lost both ships.
So, if you please...
Right. Well...
Everything I'm about to tell you is considered Code Black by the NSA.
U.S.A.C. Intercepted a radio transmission from a decaying orbit around Neptune.
The source of this transmission has been identified as the Event Horizon.
Yeah, well, that's bullshit, for starters.
- Skipper, you took me off leave...
- Thank you so much.
Smitty, sit down.
Cooper, as you were.
Let the man speak.
What was made public aboutthe Event Horizon, that she was a deep space research vessel, that her reactor went critical, and that the ship blew up, none of that is true.
The Event Horizon was the culmination of a secret government project to create a spacecraft capable of faster-than-light flight.
I don't... Excuse me.
See, you can't actually do that.
The law of relativity prohibits faster-than-light travel.
Relativity, yes.
We can't break the law of relativity.
We can go around it.
The ship doesn't really go faster than light.
What it does is it creates a dimensional gateway that allows it to jump instantaneously from one point of the universe to another light years away.
How?
- Well, it's difficult to... It's all math.
- Try us, Doctor.
Right, well, using layman's terms, we use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons.
These in turn fold space-time, consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics, until the space-time curvature becomes infinitely large and you produce a singularity.
Now, the singularity...
Layman's terms.
Fuck layman's terms.
Do you speak English?
Imagine, for a minute, that this piece of paper...
Excuse me.
That's Vanessa, and that's mine.
Attractive piece of paper represents space-time and you want to get from point "A" here to "B" there.
Now, what's the shortest distance between two points?
A straight line.
Wrong.
The shortest distance between two points is zero.
And that's what the gateway does.
It folds space.
So that point "A" and point "B" co-exist in the same space and time.
When the spacecraft passes through the gateway, space returns to normal.
It's called a gravity drive.
- How do you know all this?
- I built it.
Well, I can see why they sent you.
So if the ship didn't blow up, then what happened?
Well, the mission was going perfectly, like a textbook.
They reached safe distance using conventional thrusters.
All systems looked good.
They had the go-ahead to use the gravity drive to open the gateway to Proxima Centauri and then, they just disappeared.
Vanished without a trace, until now.
Where's she been for the last seven years, Doctor?
That's what we're here to find out.
Now, we've been unable to verity life contact, but TDRS did receive this single transmission.
- What the fucking hell is that?
- Listen to this.
Houston passed the same recording through several filters, managed to isolate what appears to be a human voice.
I'm not even sure if it qualifies as language.
- Latin.
- What?
I mean, I think it sounds like Latin.
- Can you translate it?
- Play it again.
Right there. You hear that?
Sounds like, "Liberate me," something or other.
I can't make out the rest.
"Liberate me?"
Save me.
All right. Stations, people.
Crossing the Horizon.
Optimum approach angle is 14 degrees.
- Come around to 334.
- Heading 334, sir.
Make your approach vector negative,
14 degrees.
1-4 degrees.
We have lock on Event Horizon's navigation beacon.
She's in the upper ionosphere and it looks like we're in for some very heavy chop, sir.
- Bring us in nice and tight, Mr. Smith.
- Sir.
- Mr. Justin, how's my ship?
- Smooth sailing, sir.
Matching speed on my mark.
Three, two, one. Mark.
- Range?
- 10,000 meters and closing, sir.
- Starck.
- Yes, sir.
Get on the horn.
See if anybody is listening.
This is the US Aerospace command vessel
Lewis & Ciark hailing Event Horizon.
Event Horizon, do you read?
Dr. Weir.
- I think you'll want to see this.
- Where is she?
Dead ahead. 5,000 meters!
- Starck? Anybody home?
- Event Horizon, do you read?
3,000 meters and closing!
I can't see a thing.
1,500 meters, sir.
We're getting too close.
- Where is it?
- The scope is lit. It's right in front of us.
- 1,000 meters.
- Proximity warning!
- We're right on top of her, sir!
- We're gonna hit.
- Starck!
- It's right there! God!
Reverse thrusters. Full!
There she is.
Jesus.
Very impressive ship, Doctor.
- Thank you.
- Mr. Smith, are you up for a flyby?
Yes, sir. Yes, I'd love to.
That's the main airlock, we can dock in there.
All right, Smith.
Use the arm and lock us onto that small antenna cluster.
We should go very carefully here.
That's not a load-bearing structure.
Is now, Doctor.
- Everything five by five?
- Locked in to the Event Horizon.
Thank you, Smitty.
Light them if you got them.
Thank you very much, sir.
- Starck, give me a read.
- The reactor's still hot.
We've got several small radiation sources, but no leaks.
Probably it's nothing serious.
- Do they have pressure?
- Affirmative.
The hull's intact, but there's no gravity, and the thermal units are off-line.
I'm showing deep cold.
The crew couldn't survive unless they were in stasis.
- Find them, Starck.
- Yeah, I'm already on it, Captain.
Bio-scan on the line.
There's something wrong with the scan.
- Is it radiation interference?
- There's not enough to throw it off.
I'm picking up trace life forms, but I can't get a lock on their location.
These readings are all over the ship.
It doesn't make any sense.
Okay, we do it the hard way.
Deck by deck, room by room.
Starck, deploy the umbilicus.
Smitty, fire up the boards in the war room.
Sir.
Mr. Justin,
I believe you're up for a walk?
Yes, sir.
Doctor, I'm gonna need you here on the bridge.
Captain,
I didn't come out all this way just to sit on your bridge.
- I need to be on that ship.
- Once we've secured the ship,
- we'll bring you on board.
- No, I'm sorry, that's unacceptable.
- I need to be on that ship.
- Once we've secured the ship.
That's the way it is.
I need you to guide us from the com station.
This is where I need you.
Help us do our job.
Honey, honey, you forgot your briefoase.
Stand clear.
- Anything gets funky, Cooper...
- I'll be on it.
Yo, Baby Bear, keep your nose clean.
D.J., showtime.
Video feed is clear.
- Are you with us, Dr. Weir?
- Yes, I'm with you.
We are crossing the umbilicus, making our approach to the Event Horizon.
You're at the outer airlock door.
Magnetic boots on.
We've got pressure.
Place is a deep freeze.
We got ice crystals everywhere.
That's the central corridor that you're in now.
It connects the personnel areas at the front of the ship to Engineering at the rear.
- Mr. Justin, you take Engineering.
- Yes, sir.
Peters and I'll take the forward decks.
Doctor, what are these?
Yeah, I've got another one over here.
They are all over the place.
In an emergency, they destroy the central corridor and split the ship in half and then the crew can use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
I'm in Medical. No casualties.
Place looks like it's never been used.
You stiii haven't seen any crew?
If we saw any crew, Doctor, you'd know it by now.
Scanning for life readings.
This place is a tomb.
Fuck me!
Miiier. Miiier, are you okay?
Looks like Skipper got a case of the willies.
Cooper, get back to your post.
Miiier, your heart rate just went through the roof.
I'm fine.
I think I've reached the door to the first containment, Dr. Weir.
The Engineering decks are on the other side.
Okay, let's take a look.
What the hell is this place, Dr. Weir?
It aiiows you to enter the second containment without compromising the magnetic fieids.
Looks like a meat grinder to me.
I'm on the bridge.
Got some blood here.
There must have been a coolant leak.
Man, this shit is everywhere.
Coolant level's on reserve, but well within the safety line.
Miss Peters, could you turn back and left?
- What is it?
- Ship's log.
It's stuck.
It's pretty jammed in there.
What the hell happened to his eyes?
- Explosive decompression.
- Decompression doesn't do that.
Looks iike it was caused by... i don't know, an animai or something.
Look at the damage to the soff tissue, massive abrasions.
Corpse-sicle.
I'm scanning for life forms.
Man, I'm getting some really strange readings in here.
Let me see if I can get some power up.
That's the core, the gravity drive.
The heart of the ship.
Justin. Justin, you're breaking up.
Justin, come in.
- What is it?
- I don't know.
The life scan just went off the scale.
Something's wrong, Starck.
Pull him out. Pull him out.
Shit!
He's in trouble.
- Go, Coop.
- I'm gone.
Boarding party, sound off.
This is Miller. Can anybody hear me?
- What the fuck was that?
- Pressure emergency!
We've lost the starboard baffle.
The hull's been breached!
I'll contain it here for as long as I can!
Get out!
We're losing atmosphere.
There are pressure suits in the airlock.
Go!
Here I come. Here I come.
Hold on, Baby Bear.
I'm almost there, almost there.
I got you. I got...
Watch out. Watch...
I got you. What the fuck is this?
Hold on.
Captain Miller.
Captain Miller, do you copy? Over.
- Smitty, where you been all my life?
- We have a major situation here, sir.
We've lost the starboard baffle, and the hull's been breached.
The safety circuits, they have failed.
- Do we have time for a weld?
- No, sir.
We've got 218 liters of gas left, sir, and then we've got nothing.
The oxygen tanks, they failed, they're broken.
- Sir, we are fucking dead!
- What about the Event Horizon?
What?
- She's got air and power.
- It's our only chance.
There's no way
I'm getting on that bastard.
We don't even know what happened on that ship.
It beats dying, Mr. Smith.
I want all personnel on board the Event Horizon, pronto.
- We'll meet at the air tanks.
- I'm ahead of you, sir.
Bringing all thermal units online.
Hold tight. Prep for G's.
Gravity in five seconds.
Wake up, open your eyes. All right?
Just hang in there.
Dr. Weir.
Well,
I brought most primary systems online,
- for now.
- Thank you.
- Starck, what's our status?
- The antenna array is completely fried.
We've got no radio, no laser, no high gain.
No one's coming to help us.
- This air tastes bad.
- Yeah, carbon dioxide, I know.
It's building up with every breath we take.
And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
So, we take the scrubbers from the Clark.
- That gives us what?
- Enough breathable air for 20 hours, but after that, we'd better be on our way home.
I'm on the port side of the hull, approaching the dorsal heat sink.
Holy shit.
Captain Miller. Captain Miller, do you copy? Over.
I copy, Mr. Smith. How's my ship?
Sir, we've got a 7-meter fracture on the outer hull.
We shouid be abie to repair her, but it'ii take an awfui iot of time, sir.
Negative. 20 hours, we run out of air.
Understood, sir.
What happened here, Doctor?
Okay, how is he?
His vital signs seem stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli.
I don't know.
He might wake up in 15 minutes.
He might not wake up at all.
Look, Skipper,
I know this shit sounds weird, but, I mean, there was like nothing, and then Justin appeared, and it was liquid, and the whole core just turned solid.
It's just not physically possible.
Doctor, please. Please, don't start in with that physics shit.
I'm telling you, I saw it.
Mr. Cooper, it would mean the gateway was open.
- That's it. The gateway was open.
- The gateway couldn't be open because the gravity drive wasn't activated.
Look, I'm telling you what I saw, Doc!
So...
- It can't just start up by itself.
- Mr. Cooper, you are out of line.
Doctor, Mr. Justin may die.
Now, I have to assume that whatever happened to him could happen to all of us.
Mr. Cooper says he saw something.
I believe he saw something.
I need an explanation.
In my view, Mr. Cooper's delusional, if you don't mind my saying so.
But maybe he saw an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
"An optical effect"?
That's fucking poetic.
- Where the fuck...
- Cooper!
I'm sorry. All right.
Gravitational distortion.
What could create that, Doctor?
If, somehow, a burst of gravity waves escaped from the core, it could distort space-time.
It could make Justin seem to disappear.
It could also have damaged the Lewis & Clark.
- However, I think this is entirely unlikely.
- What's in the core, Doctor?
It's complicated.
How much time do you need?
We have,
17 hours and 48 minutes.
What's in the core?
This is the gateway.
Now, these three magnetic rings, when they align, it creates an artificial black hole which allows the ship to travel to any point in space.
A black hole, the most destructive force in the universe.
- And you've created one?
- Absolutely, yes.
Because we can use that immense power to bend space-time.
Look, it would take the Lewis & Clark
1,000 years to reach our nearest star.
Butthe Event Horizon could be there in a day.
- If it worked.
- You can come down. It's perfectly safe.
So, if Mr. Justin was sucked through your gateway, he could've gone wherever the Event Horizon's been.
Theoretically, yes.
But as I told you before,
- the gateway can't just open by itself.
- I see.
Lieutenant, I want this room sealed off.
Second containment from here on in is off-limits.
- Yes, sir.
- Captain, there's no danger.
The gateway's contained behind three magnetic fields.
- It's perfectly safe.
- Safe?
Doctor, my ship is in pieces and one of my crewmen may not make it home alive.
No one else goes near this thing.
Come on.
There's got to be something on this log.
You can do this.
D.J.?
- D.J., where are you?
- I'm up on Deck 4.
Mommy.
Peters!
What is it? You all right?
What's up? You was out there so long,
I thought you were trying to break my record.
Listen, I'd rather spend the next
12 hours outside than another five seconds in this shit can.
It's the final entry in the ship's log.
I want to say how proud I am of my crew.
I'd iike to name my station heads:
Chris Chambers, Janice Reuben,
Ben Fender, Dick Smith.
We've reached safe distance...
This is John Kilpack, ship's captain.
...and we're preparing to engage the gravity drive, and open the gateway to Proxima Centauri.
Haii and fareweii.
- What is that?
- I'll run it through a few filters, see if I can clean it up.
- It's a power drain.
- It's the core.
Stay here. Look after Justin.
I don't want anybody else near that thing.
Wait for me, Doctor.
- What's causing the drain?
- Magnetic fields are holding.
Maybe a short in the fail-safe circuit.
I'll check it.
Can you give us a hand?
Justin.
Justin, can you hear me?
- He's coming.
- Who's coming?
The dark.
Yeah, that's the one.
Biiiy.
Miller!
Captain Miller!
I've got some problems here.
Be with me, forever.
Dr. Weir?
Carbon dioxide can produce hallucinations, impair judgment.
God damn it, D.J., it was not a hallucination.
All right.
Doctor, you were in the duct.
You must have heard something.
- You must have seen something.
- I did.
About an hour ago, I saw my son lying on the examination table
- and in his legs were...
- Miss Peters...
...crawling...
...if you don't mind my saying so, it sounds a little like shock.
- Could it be that you're traumatized...
- No. No.
...by seeing the body on the...
- Excuse me. No!
I've seen bodies before.
This was different.
She's right. Now, this was real.
I felt... I felt heat.
This is not something that's in our heads.
Smitty, have you seen anything unusual at all?
No, I haven't seen anything, and I don't need to see anything, sir, but I can tell you this ship is fucked.
Thank you for that scientific analysis,
Mr. Smith.
Well, you don't expect to figure it out, do you?
All right, Doc.
When you break all the laws of physics, you seriously think there won't be a price?
You already killed the last fucking crew.
And now you want to kill us as well!
- It's just a fucking ship, all right?
- D.J.!
It's just a ship, do you understand?
It's just a big hunk of metal.
- There's nothing odd going on.
- D.J.?
- Fine.
- D.J.?
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm just...
I'm sorry.
- Damn it!
- Smitty.
- It's all right. That's it.
- Fucking...
That's enough! I want you calm,
I want you cool! Now!
- All right.
- You're going back upstairs.
You're going outside on the Clark with Cooper, and you're going to repair the ship.
No mistakes.
Mistakes, nobody goes home.
Understood?
- Yes, sir.
- All right.
- Sir.
- Get moving.
- Miller.
- What is it, Starck?
I ran the bio-scan with the DNA-RNA filters.
The results were bio readings...
Of an indeterminate origin. Yes, I know.
Don't you have anything useful to tell me, Lieutenant?
- I've got a theory.
- Let's hear it.
I think that there's a connection between the readings and the hallucinations, like they're all part of a defensive reaction, some sort of immune system.
I don't have time to listen to this.
- You have to listen to me.
- To what?
I'm saying that this ship is reacting to us and the reactions are getting stronger.
It's as if the ship brought back something with it, a life force of some kind.
What are you telling me?
That this ship is alive?
You wanted an answer, and it's the only one I've got.
No, what I want, Lieutenant, is to survive the next 10 hours.
Justin?
Justin!
Did you hear that? Did you hear that?
- What's that?
- What is it?
- You heard it.
- What did you hear?
- What is it?
- Peters, listen to me.
It's D.J., all right?
I didn't hear anything.
Neither of us heard anything.
- So just calm down, all right?
- Okay.
- Get your breath back.
- Okay.
- Now, tell me.
- I was...
Make it stop! Make it stop!
Open the door.
Stop moving!
- No!
- Weir, stop. Stop him!
What're you doing?
In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.
What is it?
The forward airlock.
Miller, Smith, Cooper, anyone in the airlock?
That's a negative, Starck.
Justin.
- Justin.
- Don't!
Justin, no!
Justin, no! Justin, open the door.
Miller, come in.
Miiier, come in. We have an emergency.
What's going on in there, Starck?
- Justin's in the airlock.
- Say again.
Justin is in the airlock and he is not wearing a suit.
- Shit. I'm on it.
- As you were, sailor.
- Skipper, you need me on this.
- I need you right where you are.
He's engaged the override.
- Can you shut it down?
- I'll try.
Coming to him, Starck.
Justin! Open this door, now!
Starck, give me status.
You better hurry.
He's engaged the override
- and we can't open the inner door.
- I'll get the kit.
Justin, open the door!
Justin, open the door.
- Did you hear it?
- Keep him talking.
Yes. Yes, I heard it.
Do you know what it is?
It shows you things,
- horrible things.
- What does?
The dark inside me from the other place.
- I won't go back there. I won't.
- No, Baby Bear.
- Come on, open the door.
- What's happening?
- I don't think she can talk him down.
- She'd better.
If he opens the airlock, he's going to turn inside out.
- No. You stay with me.
- Almost got it.
- I've almost got it.
- You stay with me, Justin.
Come on, now. Open that door!
If you could see the things I've seen, you wouldn't try to stop me.
No, that's not you talking.
That's not you talking.
That's it. That's it, right there.
Open the door. Go for that button.
Come on.
Okay.
No!
Captain, Justin just activated the door.
It's on a 30-second delay.
Justin!
Stand by for decompression in 25 seconds.
Where am I?
- Hey.
- Starck, get it fucking open!
- Hey, open the door.
- I can't.
The inner door won't open when the outside door's been triggered.
- It'd decompress the entire ship.
- Oh, my God.
Mama Bear, open the door.
Come on, please.
- Captain!
- Patch me through to him.
Captain Miller, tell them to open the door.
They can't do that, Justin.
- I don't want to die in here.
- You're not gonna die.
I want you to listen to me very carefully, and I'm gonna get you out of there.
Oh, my God.
It's starting.
- My eyes.
- Don't think about them. Shut them.
Just shut them as tight as you can.
Five seconds.
Tuck yourself into a crouch position.
Make yourself into a ball now.
I can't breathe. Ch, God.
Oh, God, it hurts.
I want you to huff and puff and blow all the air out of your lungs.
Do you hear me?
All the air out of your lungs, Justin.
Do it, now!
Okay, Baby Bear.
Got him. I got him. Stand by, people.
Standby.
- We've got pressure.
- We're coming, Justin. We're coming.
I'm going to need five units here.
Hold his head still.
Okay.
Give me some more glycerin, now.
One thing at a time, iet's keep him breathing.
Christ, he's bieeding out.
- Pressure's stiii dropping.
- Start the drip, 15 cc.
I've stopped the bleeding, stabilized him best I can.
He won't be pretty, but he should live
- if we make it back.
- We'll make it.
Starck, what's our time like?
CO2 levels will become toxic in four hours.
All right.
Peters, we've got to find out what happened to the other crew before the same thing happens to us.
I can work on the log on the bridge, but I won't go back to Medical.
- Fine.
- Yes, sir.
Justin said something about,
"the dark inside me."
What's that mean?
Doctor?
I don't think it means anything.
Don't you walk away from me, mister.
I'd like some answers, Doctor.
I'd like to know why one of my men tried to commit suicide by throwing himself out of an airlock.
I'd like to know what caused that noise.
Look, thermal changes in the hull could've caused the metal to expand and contract rapidly, causing reverberations.
This is possible.
Bullshit! You built this fucking ship.
You've given me nothing but bullshit.
What do you want me to say?
You said the ship's drive creates a gateway.
- Yeah.
- To what?
- I don't know.
- Where did it go?
- Where did you send it?
- I don't know.
Where has it been for the last seven years?
Look, I don't know.
"I don't know," is not good enough, Doctor.
You're supposed to be the fucking expert.
I need answers. That's your job.
- Now, the other place, where is that?
- I don't know! I don't know!
Look, there's a lot of things happening around here that I don't fully understand. I need time.
I see.
Well, that's exactly what we don't have, Doctor.
Captain!
Don't ieave me!
Piease!
For God's sakes, heip me!
It's in your head.
It's just in your head.
God help us.
I'm telling you, it was his voice I heard.
He was calling to me.
A young bosun named Eddie Corrick.
We served on the Goliath together.
When the O2 tanks ruptured, four of us made it to the lifeboat.
But Corrick was still on board the Goliath when the fire broke out.
You ever seen fire in zero gravity?
It's beautiful.
It's like liquid.
It slides all over everything.
Comes up in waves.
And they just kept hitting him, wave after wave.
He was screaming for me to save him.
What did you do?
I did the only thing I could.
I closed the lifeboat hatch, and I left him behind.
I swore I'd never lose another man.
I've known you a long time.
- You never told me that.
- That's just it, D.J., I never told anybody.
But this ship knew about it.
It knows my fears. It knows my secrets.
Gets inside your head, and it shows you.
I wasn't going to tell you this.
I've been listening to the distress signal.
And I...
I think I made a mistake in the translation.
Go on.
I thought it said "liberate me."
Save me.
But it's not "me."
It's "iiberate tutume."
Save yourself.
And it gets worse.
There.
I think, that says "ex inferis."
"Save yourself,
"from hell."
Look, if what Dr. Weir tells us is true, this ship has been beyond the boundaries of our universe of known scientific reality.
Who knows where it's been, what it's seen, and what it's brought back with it.
From hell.
You don't believe in that kind of stuff, do you?
Whoever sent that message, he sure believes in hell.
Captain Miiier.
Whatever it is, Coop, it better be good.
Yes, sir.
Ready to repressurize the Clark and get the heii out of here.
On my way.
Come on, baby, don't let me down.
Hello, baby. Papa's home.
She's holding.
Oh, shit.
Skipper, we're still venting trace gasses.
Give me about 20 minutes to plug the hole.
Cooper, you are the iifesaver.
20 minutes and we're underway.
Shit.
- Got any coffee?
- Yeah, but it's cold.
Great.
Starck.
Miller?
We're leaving.
No, we can't leave.
Our orders are specific.
Rescue the crew, salvage what's left of the ship.
The crew is dead, Doctor.
Your ship killed them.
- We came here to do a job.
- We're aborting, Doctor!
Starck, download the files from the Event Horizon's computers.
D.J., I want you to get Justin prepped and ready to move him back to the Clark.
There's stuff I wanna get from medical.
We'd better move him in the tank.
No problem. Do it.
- Peters.
- Yes, sir.
I want you to get the CO2 scrubbers back into the Clark.
- Take Smitty with you.
- Right.
Captain.
- Don't do this.
- It's done.
What about my ship?
You can't just leave her.
I have no intention of leaving her,
Doctor.
I will take the Lewis & Clark to a safe distance, and then I will launch tac missiles atthe Event Horizon, until I'm satisfied she's vaporized.
Fuck this ship.
Captain Miller, the bio-scan just went off the scale.
It looks like the core is draining power from the rest of the ship.
Get the files. Vacate.
I want off this ship.
You can't leave. She won't let you.
You just get your gear and get back on the Lewis & Clark Doctor, or you'll find yourself walking home.
I am home.
Let's go!
Ready?
Shot.
Come on.
- Ready?
- Shot.
- Shot.
- Okay.
Peters, can we go?
This place is really freaking me out.
Yeah, you wanna breathe on the way home.
- No, I don't! Let's go!
- Shit!
- Come on!
- We need 25.
- Peters!
Come on! Got it!
Oh, no. Peters.
Oh, God.
Biiiy.
Claire?
Claire.
It's me. I'm home.
I'm home.
I know I wasn't there when you needed me, and I'm sorry I...
I let my work come between us.
God, Claire, no.
I'm begging you, please. Please, don't.
Not again, please.
I've been so...
Billy.
It's all right.
- I've been so alone.
- You'll never be alone again.
You're with me now. You're with me and I have such wonderful, wonderful things to show you.
Damn, I'm good.
Coop.
Coop, how long are you going to take?
'Cause I've got to get the heii out of here.
Look, you can kiss my ass, Smith,
'cause I'm done.
Just give me a second to collect my tools and we can get out of Dodge.
- Two minutes tops.
- Roger that.
Weir.
Dr. Weir.
Weir!
Dr. Weir, get your ass back on board now!
Weir!
Shit.
Captain Miller,
Captain Miller, do you copy? Over.
Captain Miiier.
Captain Miiier, do you copy? Over.
Go ahead, Smitty.
I've just seen Weir messing around on the Clark sir.
Stand by, Smitty,
I wanna check something out.
- Smith, get out of there.
- Come again, sir?
One of the expiosives is missing from the corridor.
- Weir might have put it on the Clark.
- No. No way.
No, sir, no way.
I've just put it back together, sir.
Get off the Clark now, Smith!
Where the fucking hell are you?
Got you.
Hang on, Smitty. I'm coming!
No!
Shit!
Where the fuck am I going?
Why does this shit got to happen to me?
Fuck.
All right, think, Coop. Think. Think.
All right, I got to get back to the ship.
I got to get back to the ship, all right.
I gotta blow my air tank.
I'll blow my air tank.
All right. Fuck.
This better work. This shit better work.
All right.
Here I go. All right.
One, two, three. Come on.
Come on. Yes!
Here I come, motherfuckers!
D.J.
- What was that?
- Clark's gone.
- Smitty and Cooper are dead.
- What? What the... it was Weir.
You spot him, you take him out.
Understood.
- Be carefui, D.J.
- Don't worry about Weir.
I'll take care of him.
D.J.?
D.J.? D.J., answer me!
Okay, Dr. Weir.
You don't wanna leave your ship?
You never will.
Starck.
It's okay.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Okay.
Easy.
Oh, my God.
What happened to your eyes?
Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.
What are you talking about?
I created the Event Horizon to reach the stars.
But she's gone much, much further than that.
She tore a hole in our universe, a gateway to another dimension.
A dimension of pure chaos, pure evil.
When she crossed over, she was just a ship.
But when she came back, she was alive.
Look at her, Miller.
Isn't she beautiful?
Your beautiful ship killed its crew, Doctor.
Well, now she has another crew.
Now she has us.
What do you think you're doing, Doctor?
You wanted to know where the ship has been, so now you'll find out.
- If you miss me, you blow out the hull.
- What makes you think I'll miss?
That's right, I'm back!
I'm... Shit, I can't stop. Hey!
Hey! Fuck.
What? Who the fuck? Oh, shit!
Miller! Miller!
Give me your hand!
- Come on!
- I can't!
I'm not leaving you.
Forward airlock.
It can't be Weir.
I'm not taking any chances.
You watch your back.
- Yo! Don't hit me.
- Cooper!
Take it off! Take it off!
- I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
- You're okay.
- You're okay. It's over.
- No, it's not.
Weir's activated the gravity drive.
We got to shut it down.
- How? The bridge is gone.
- What about Engineering?
You think you can shut it down from there?
I don't know the process.
Dr. Weir was the expert.
I don't want to go where the other crew went, okay?
- I'd rather be dead.
- Okay.
- Okay, we blow the fucker up.
- We blow it up?
Do like Weir said. Blow the corridor, separate us from the rest of ship.
Use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
With any luck, TDRS will pick up our emergency beacon.
We prep the gravity couches, put ourselves in stasis, and stand by for a search and rescue team.
Meantime, I'm gonna go manually arm these explosives.
- Skipper, will this shit work?
- It worked for Dr. Weir.
You go activate the emergency beacon.
You get back here double-quick.
- Yes, sir.
- I'll come with you.
You stay here.
You prep the gravity couches.
Miller.
Close this door behind me, Lieutenant.
Gateway opening in T minus five minutes.
Emergency beacon activated.
Yes.
Blood?
Oh, fuck me.
Fuck me.
Starck!
Run!
Gateway opening in T minus three minutes.
Detonator reiease is authorized.
The main corridor is now armed.
We're armed. She's ready to blow.
I repeat, we are armed.
She's ready to blow.
Miller. Miller, can you hear me?
We have to get out of here now.
You let me burn.
Gateway opening in T minus two minutes.
Miller.
You left me behind.
No, you're not Edmund Corrick.
I watched him die.
Weir?
The ship brought me back.
I told you she won't let me leave.
She won't let anyone leave.
Did you really think you could destroy this ship?
She's defied space and time.
She's been to a place you couldn't possibly imagine.
And now,
- it is time to go back.
- I know, to hell.
You know nothing. Hell is only a word.
The reality is much, much worse.
Now let me show you.
Help me!
No!
No.
- You see?
- No.
They're not dead. They're not dead.
Not yet.
You won't take my crew.
They're not your crew anymore.
They belong to the ship.
Gateway opening.
Take me.
You take me. You leave them alone.
No. There is no escape.
The gateway is open, and you are all coming with me.
Do you see?
Yes,
I see.
No!
Miller.
This is Rescue One. We have contact.
Approaching the wreckage of the Event Horizon.
Prepare to board.
I'm entering the grav couch bay.
It doesn't appear to have been damaged in the explosion.
There appear to be three survivors:
Cooper, Justin, Lieutenant Starck.
Justin seems to have suffered massive injuries but he's still alive.
The grav couches still have power.
I'm opening the first tank now.
It's all right. It's okay.
- You're safe now.
- Justin, Cooper.
They're fine. They're with us.
They're with us.
- Starck. Starck.
- Stay calm. It's all right.
- Calm down, it's me.
- Breathe deeply.
- Starck.
- Breathe deeply.
- It's the rescue team.
- I need a sedative here, now!
- I got you, Starck. I got you.
- It's okay.
I need a sedative here, now!
Starck, it's the rescue team. We're safe.
- Okay, okay, I need it now!
- We're safe.
It's headed right for the pin.
- All right.
- Oh, man!
Why can't I hit a ball like that?
I could answer that, or you could just look in the mirror.
All right, what did I miss?
The Swedish guy is starting to choke.
Swedish guy?
Who taught him how to swing?
Heidi?
Actually, Heidi was Swiss.
Get out of my chair.
- Hey, can you move over a little bit?
- No, take the middle.
I don't want the middle.
Gianni, move over to the middle.
- Will you just sit down?
- All right, you're gonna feel a little man thigh.
- How does that-- you like that?
- Come on!
- Move it already.
- People, shut up, all of you guys.
- What, what's wrong?
- Nothing, it's...
Debra's not feeling well bio... hormonally.
Oh, got it.
The enemy within.
So, do me a favor, just don't give her a reason-- be cool, be cool, be cool.
Hey, Ray, these were on top of the hamper.
Are they dirty, or are they clean?
Yeah, those are dirty.
They're dirt-- okay, well, then, Ray, let me enlighten you as to how a hamper works, okay?
There's a lid on it, and that lid lifts up.
Now you take your clothes-- not your clean clothes, not the clothes you're wearing right now, but your dirty clothes-- you lift that lid, you insert the clothes and you shut that lid.
Yeah, got it, got it.
This is very nice, Ray.
Yeah, this is very nice.
- Pretzel crumbs all over the place.
- I'm gonna clean those up.
Okay, see what
I'm talking about?
Freakin' mood swings.
If they find me chopped up in a freezer, don't believe the suicide note.
It's a beautiful shot.
It's a rough time of the month.
A lot of criminals turn themselves in when their wives are like this.
Just do me a favor. Don't be like animals. I don't need to--
Iceberg dead ahead.
- Coaster, Robert. Robert, coaster.
- What?
Need help?
Need any help?
No, I'm going to the bank, all right?
Listen, when the buzzer goes off, could you maybe take the clothes out of the dryer?
Yeah, no problem.
How long you gonna be?
Why?
Oh, nothing.
No, take your time, yeah.
Or hurry back if you want to.
It's your choice.
I thought she'd never leave.
Is Debra aware how she's coming off to others?
I mean, she doesn't hear herself.
Then if I bring it up to her, she gets all nuts and denies it.
That's the sickness.
You should get her on tape and make her listen to it.
You wanna wear a wire?
I'll shave you down and hook you up.
Why doesn't she just take something for this?
What's she gonna take?
Raymond, have you ever been in a drugstore. Huh?
There's a whole wing dedicated to this problem.
Yeah, all right, what am I gonna do, buy her something?
Besides, I wouldn't even know what to get.
Get 'em all.
Yeah, all right. Just don't worry about me, all right?
I'll just ride it out.
You dumb bastard.
- What?
- "Ride it out."
You put a stop to this now.
All right, Dad, all right.
Let me ask you-- she's in a bad mood, what, two, three days tops?
Not so tough now, right?
Pretty soon she's gonna get a mood that lasts five days.
Then it's a week.
And before you know it, what used to be a bad mood now takes over and becomes her only mood.
And then, you become like me... where not a day goes by that I don't wish there was a comet screaming towards Earth to bring me sweet relief.
- What's so funny?
- Dumb bastard. He is a dumb bastard.
Hey, banjo pants.
Hope you're in the mood for some delicious ltalian.
And I don'tmeanjustme.
Big bag of Nemo's takeout.
Oh.
What? I went by and I stopped, and I picked up some dinner.
I also picked up some after-dinner mints, which for your sake
I've already dipped into.
I've already started dinner.
Why didn't you call me ahead of time?
Who knows?
But look, surprise!
Garlic bread.
Well, I've made a salad, and I've cooked the rice, but... forget it.
We'll eat your food.
You all right?
Yeah, it's-- fine. I'm sorry.
Thanks for the dinner.
Don't worry about it.
Look, I know a lot of stuff's going on femininally.
You know...
I know it's not your fault.
I understand that.
It's, uh-- you know, it's like a Jekyll and Hyde thing.
Only more Hyde.
If he's the bad one.
It was Hyde, right?
Whatever-- whatever-- whatever it is, I know it's not you that's yelling at my friends for making a mess or getting all crazy about clothes on the hamper.
I know that that's not you.
That's Hyde.
If he was the bad one.
But you know what?
While I was out today,
I got you something.
I really-- I want to help you feel better, you know, and-- and-- and this should take care of all your symptoms.
Except for bitchy, right, Ray?
What do you mean?
I mean, there's nothing in here for bitchy.
Probably need a prescription for bitchy.
This is just like you, Ray.
Just when I think that you can't be any more insensitive, you rise to the occasion.
Hi, are the kids home yet?
I've got cookies.
Oh, Mama, Mom, Mom.
- Please, go home. It's not a good time.
- That's okay.
She can stay if she wants.
I'm not afraid if she hears this.
Jekyll would be.
I cannot take this anymore.
Okay, you make a huge mess, you don't help me at all, you invite your friends over to drive me crazy all day and all you can think of is,
"Oh, she must have PMS.
Let's just load her up with drugs."
No, it's got
St. Johns worts in it.
I can't believe you.
If there's ever anything wrong, it's PMS, huh?
I don't know what to do!
Sometimes I just want to smack you!
Debra's right, Raymond.
- I'm sorry.
- You smacked me.
I know I did.
I'm sorry.
W-w-what did you do that for?
It's just that it sounds like you're becoming just like your father.
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.
I don't know.
It's just that-- he was so awful during my...
Iadies' days.
Anytime I happened to make a comment about his usual disgusting behavior,
- he would just blame it on that.
- That's what Ray does.
That's what they all do.
What are you talking about?
I'm just trying to help.
- You should be quiet.
- Yes. Yes.
Oh, no, he is trying to help.
Look what he did.
Look what he bought me.
Magic pills, huh?
Maybe I should try some.
Oh, look, Ray's clothes just flew off the bed and into the hamper.
These really work.
Let me have one.
Oh, Frank's toenails just crawled right into the garbage can.
What are you-- what are you doing, Mom?
It's me, Raymie.
Raymond, you know that I always let you two fight your own battles, but I can't let you go on with this cycle of your father's imbecility.
- I'm out of here.
- Oh, come on, where you going?
Maybe I'll call Amy. Maybe I'll go to the mall, do some shopping.
I'm leaving, too.
I'm gonna talk to your father.
Oh, please, come on.
Debra, Debra, please.
Don't say one more word, or I'll send your mother right back in here to smack the crap out of you.
Three-game series is even at one apiece.
- Hi.
- Oh, you're home.
You have a good time?
- Yeah.
- What did you do?
I told you.
I went shopping with Amy.
Shopping.
For five hours.
Where are your shopping bags?
I didn't buy anything.
We just walked around for awhile, went back to Amy's and just sat around, talking, relaxing.
Oh, sit around talking, relaxing.
Wanna hear my evening?
I fed the kids dinner.
Peanut butter and jelly.
Then I gave 'em a bath
'cause they were covered in peanut butter and jelly.
Then I'm mean 'cause
I won't let them sleep in a tree house and then they went to bed yelling and screaming.
So, that was my evening, thank you very much.
Well, that's my evening every night, so--
Oh, don't even!
You just wanted me to suffer tonight.
- What?
- Yes. It's not fair.
You get to walk out and do whatever you want and--
Iet's just say it-- use your ladies' days as an excuse to treat me rotten every month.
My needing to get out of here once in a while has nothing to do with my ladies' days.
Bull-loney.
- What?
- Baloney!
You wanna see?
'Cause I don't care, okay?
I don't care anymore. I tried to be nice and that doesn't work.
Here, look at this.
Do you see this day? That's today.
Now this is last month.
What a coincidence that on the same day last month
I found my golf clubs upside down in the garbage can!
I'm telling you,
I'm sick of this, all right?
Every month the same wacko screaming at me for no reason!
Having meltdowns and crying, crying over nothing!
And you won't even admit what it is, and God forbid I should mention what might be the problem!
You know what I think?
That you enjoy your ladies' days,
'cause I deserve to be treated like this. "Look what day it is.
Oh, come here, Ray."
Pow pow pow!
"Oh, I've been saving that up."
And then after a couple days of that, you're like,
"Oh, sorry, Ray, I was just a little bit... you know."
And by the way, the next time I used those clubs,
I shot a 1 10, so don't think I don't know you didn't put a curse on them.
You are out of your mind.
No, you are!
Once a month!
If what I'm saying isn't true, how come you don't treat me like this on all the other days?
I treat you just fine, Ray.
You're just mad,
'cause you had to spend one lousy night with the kids!
- You don't go crazy this time of month?
- No.
You remain perfectly calm, don't overreact, don't treat me meanly or yell at me like a screaming raving maniac?
No, I do not.
4:38 today... right when the guys went home.
I've told you eight million times, when you empty the dryer you clean the lint screen!
Look at all this lint.
What, do you like lint, Ray?
Maybe I'll get you some for your birthday.
Happy birthday, Ray.
Here's your lint!
I just thought you'd, you know, wanna hear what you sound like when you're like this.
Okay?
You are a gigantic ass!
Listen, I'm sorry.
I know what it's like to hear yourself on tape.
I remember when I heard my first radio interview.
First of all, I sounded like Snuffleupagus.
I said, "Do I really sound like that?"
- And Andy--
- Oh, would you stop it?
I'm not crying because of what I sound like.
I'm crying because I'm married to an insensitive derfwad, who instead of trying to make life better for his wife, tape records her so he has proof that she's a terrible person.
What's a derfwad?
What, was that tape for the guys, huh?
"Hey, come on, fellas, step right up and listen to the witch who killed my good time."
- No no, it's just for us.
- Yeah yeah.
Where's my tape recorder, Ray?
Where was my tape recorder when I was in labor with the twins for 36 hours and you were asking the nurse if the TV gets ESPN?
- 36 hours, that's not a short time.
- Yeah, guess what?
It's even longer when you're trying to push two human beings out of your body while your husband's going,
"Does this hospital have fudgesicles?"
Yeah, where's my tape recorder, huh?
Or when you ask me why I get so upset because I find your underpants in the kitchen, huh?
Or when you start snoring at my grandmother's funeral?
Or when you tape a football game over our wedding video?!
Do you really need a tape recorder?
- You seem to remember everything.
- Yeah.
That's right, Ray.
I remember everything, and I'm not gonna forget either.
Honey, I think you make some excellent points here, but I can't help wondering that maybe part of the reason you're so upset right now might possibly be PMS-related.
Would somebody get me a tape recorder?
Because I cannot believe you said that!
- I just don't know what to do.
- Yeah. Yeah, no kidding.
Listen, if I had PMS-- and I'm not saying that I have-- is that how you help me, by taping me, by telling me I have PMS? That doesn't help me, Ray! That doesn't help me!
Well, what do you want me to do?!
I don't know what to do!
Show me what to do!
- Just draw it out for me!
- How about giving me a hug?
Ahug?!
Yes, a hug. Did you ever think of hugging me, you jerk?!
Well, it's pretty hard to hug someone who's trying to kill you!
Yeah, well, it never occurred to you.
You've never tried it before!
Well, look, this is not huggable!
This-- this is not Debra.
This is the woman shows up once a month to rip into me
Iike a monkey on a cupcake!
All right, that's it!
That's the reason I taped you, so you could hear yourself and maybe admit that there might be a problem that isn't just me being a dorkwang or whatever!
Hello.
Hi, Amy.
Yeah yeah.
You went back for that dress?
How much was it?
Oh, you are so bad.
Yeah, right right right right right right.
Oh, God. I know.
Me too. Me too.
Oh my God.
Okay, listen,
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?
Okay. All right, bye-bye.
Jeez.
Feeling better?
She's so funny.
Yeah, she is.
Could we put her number on speed dial?
Listen, Ray.
I'm sorry.
I guess I am a little-- you know.
Didn't want to say anything.
Listen, l...
I don't mean to lay into you like that.
I know.
I know. I know.
Come on, sit.
No, it's okay.
Ray.
Honey, listen.
It's just that, you know,
I need a little understanding.
Just a little caring.
I need to know that, you know, if I'm going through a rough time, that you're there for me and that you wanna, you know, just take care of me.
I do want to.
You're my girl.
I love you, Ray.
- Oh, God, you're a mess.
- I know.
Listen, you want to just try those pills that I got you?
'Cause I really just want you to feel better.
Yeah, I know, but I just want you to know that, you know, no pill is gonna solve everything.
- Yeah, I know that.
- Any idea what goes on in here?
- Let me just get 'em.
- I know, but I just-- yes, there's all these emotions and feelings, but l--
I'm very into all of that.
Let me get the pills.
Here we go.
Here we go.
It's okay. It's okay.
Look, it's for bloating--
"for bloating, cramps" and right there,
"irritability associated with PMS."
We have a winner.
Goes great with ginger ale.
Okay, here we go.
Here we go.
What? Hey, come on.
Why don't you just lock me in the attic for a few days?
You're the one-- you're--
You're the one who said, "Hug me."
The hug was your idea.
Come on, comet.
So you think I'm just rude and insensitive?
That I'm so tough to live with, and you're the Queen of Sheba?
Did you ever hear yourself?
Well, in case you haven't, here's a little trick that my boy Raymond taught me.
I said, "Where's my eggs?"
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Here it is.
What? It's just my feet!
They're not dirty.
Oh, crap.
Hey, where you going?
You scared you're gonna hear something you don't like?
If I scratch it, it's because it itches!
Go on, Barbara.
We go back to our homeroom for dismissal.
Unless you have a pass for sports or something.
Is that what you did on the day in question?
No. Mr. Gettys asked me to stay after class.
What happened next, Barbara?
He told me to sit in the chair beside his desk.
Barbara.
If you will, in your own words, tell us exactly what happened... in the next few minutes.
I told him I was afraid I'd miss my bus.
He promised I'd get to the bus on time if I'd help him do something.
Then, before I could say anything, he placed his hand inside my blouse.
I was so frightened. I didn't move.
I thought if I was just quiet it'd be okay.
Then his other hand went up under inside my skirt.
Then, with his hand... he started moving back and forth... farther and farther inside my skirt.
He said he was testing to see if I had any special feelings... that he wanted to see what kind of feelings I had.
I was trying to think of something to say, but I couldn't.
I was confused, and he just kept on.
I asked him to stop, but it was like he couldn't hear.
He just kept on with his hand.
Then I screamed.
Then he got mad and said we'd have to try it again sometime.
Did he try again?
Not with me.
But with your friends?
Yes.
And after you had told them what he had done to you... they told you what he had done to them!
Isn't that true?
Yes.
I have nothing further.
Your witness, Mr. Lomax.
Any chance, Your Honor, for a short recess?
Of course.
This court will be in recess for 15 minutes.
- Honey, what...?
- Not now, Bernice.
Lomax, what's wrong?
As your attorney, I'm advising you to keep the fuck away from me.
Why? What are you talking about?
The wife, the kid, the outrage.
You definitely had me fooled.
Hey, you're my lawyer.
You're here to defend me.
Know what I think? Why not put you on the stand? You can jerk off for the judge.
- You know she's lying.
- Get the hell away from me.
Well, hell, there you are.
Rumor was you were out wandering in traffic.
Not now, Larry.
What's the game plan?
I got a 4:30 deadline. I need a quote.
Give me a quote.
Fuck off.
Mr. Lomax had no comment on today's events.
Speculation, however, was widespread... that the young lawyer's unblemished string of victories... would come to an end... in this courtroom.
It was a nice run, Kev.
Had to close out someday.
Nobody wins them all.
Have you had any discipline problems... in math class this year?
No.
No?
Hasn't Mr. Gettys had to talk to you repeatedly about your behavior?
Isn't that why he asked you to stay after class?
No.
Have other teachers asked you to stay after class?
Once or twice.
- Did they want to talk about your behavior?
- Objection. Immaterial.
- Goes to motive.
- Overruled.
You may answer the question.
I don't know what the other teachers wanted.
You'd have to talk to them.
You ever pass notes in class, Barbara?
Maybe a note that... made fun of Mr. Gettys?
- No.
- No?
Never called him a disgusting pig monster?
Order.
No.
Your Honor, I've pre-marked this
Defense Exhibit A.
Objection. We've had plenty of time for discovery here.
I'm going to let this in, Mr. Lomax.
I'm also going to suggest that if you have any other exhibits... you present them in a timely fashion, or not at all.
I'm sorry, Barbara, I was wrong.
It's huge hog beast.
This is your handwriting, isn't it?
- Yes, but...
- You wrote this in Gettys' class.
- It's a joke.
- "He's a huge hog beast."
He probably eats a thousand pancakes for breakfast."
You're writing about Mr. Gettys, aren't you?
It was meant to be a joke.
Have you ever had a party at your house, Barbara... when your parents were away?
Objection. Your Honor, this is way out of line.
- Credibility and bias.
- Overruled.
Answer the question.
Yes.
Have you ever heard of a game called "Special Places"?
You're under oath, Barbara.
A man's career... his reputation... his life is on the line.
This is not a joke.
Have you ever played the game "Special Places"?
Yes.
Is this game sexual in nature?
Is this game sexual in nature?
We only played it once.
This special party, Barbara... this was the first time you told the story about Mr. Gettys, wasn't it?
Yes.
I've spoken to other children who were there that day.
Is there anything else they may have told me about the party?
Objection. If he has other witnesses, let him call them.
If I need to call those other children, I will.
I'm going to sustain that, Mr. Lomax.
Rephrase your question.
You threatened those children, didn't you?
That's not the way it happened.
You told them to lie, to falsely claim that Mr. Gettys had hurt them.
These things did happen.
If they didn't, you were going to tell everyone about this special party.
They happened to me.
So you made up a story. A special story.
A story about a math teacher... who was tough on you, who kept you after class.
A huge hog beast you didn't like!
That's what really happened, isn't it?
No.
I didn't want to be the only one.
You goddamn lowlife, son of a bitch...
You leave that girl alone, that's enough.
Bailiff, evict that man.
No further questions, Your Honor.
I'm going to adjourn for the day.
We'll be back here at 9:00 in the morning and people will behave themselves...
You made me proud.
Or find themselves in contempt.
Good evening.
Pack it up, baby. You need a drink.
- You go, Gators.
- Yeah.
In the event that we all get drunk, let's front-load the ceremonial bullshit.
To the best trial lawyer in Alachua County.
Damn straight.
So, Kev, off the record... how's it feel to squeeze a man like Gettys... through the door of reasonable doubt?
Larry.
Why don't you quit being a party pooper?
Have yourself a drink.
We're not going to discuss the damn case anymore.
Am I right?
I'll drink to that.
No shop talk.
- Pour me another.
- Hey, baby.
Lomax, you're wild.
I feel one of them nights coming on.
I've seen the Eiffel Tower
And I've seen the Taj Mahal
And I've even been to China
And I've seen the Great Wall
I've seen the Pacific Ocean
The Statue of Liberty
I gotta go piss.
- What?
- I gotta go piss.
I gotta go piss!
Okay.
Hurry.
Hey!
Show me your tattoo
Mr. Lomax. Hell of a job today.
I don't want to disturb your party.
"Milton, Chadwick, Waters."
Never heard of it.
What are you going to do? Sue me?
Actually, we were hoping to retain your services.
We've been following your progress.
From New York?
You've never lost a case.
I've had some sympathetic juries.
That's exactly what we're looking for.
We want you to come to New York, help us pick a jury.
I tell you, man... you're pretty damn good.
Your card is great.
And the black thing, you being black...
Whose idea was that? Paul's?
That's just brilliant.
I'm just not drunk enough yet to fall for it.
I'll buy you a drink when I...
You'd have to start next week.
All expenses, first-class travel and lodging, you and your wife.
A lump-sum payment, regardless of the verdict, in the amount of...
Well, hey.
Take a look.
Please, baby, baby, please
Please, show me your tattoo
Baby
In the name of Lord Jesus... we refute you, Satan, and cast you out and go forth with the zeal of the Lord.
Amen.
Romans 16:19 says!
Be excellent in what is good
Be innocent of evil
And the God of Peace
Will soon crush Satan
God will crush him
Underneath your feet
And the God of Peace
Will soon crush Satan
God will crush him
Underneath your feet
Romans 16:19 says
All the way to New York just to pick a jury?
Every dog gets his day.
Why do I feel the hand of Mary Ann on this adventure?
I gotta tell you, Ma, this routine's getting awful tired.
Working on Sunday.
Working? Ma, get over it.
Ma. Listen to me. I love my wife.
Okay? I love her all the way.
Just like you.
- Let me tell you about New York.
- Let me guess.
Fallen, fallen, is Babylon.
It has become a dwelling place of demons.
Revelation 18.
Wouldn't hurt you to look it over.
- Couldn't forget it if I tried.
- Oh, really?
And what happened to Babylon?
Thou mighty city, in one hour has thy mighty judgment come.
And the light of a single lamp shall shine in thee no more.
Wish me luck.
Good luck.
I'll miss you.
No. Jeannie, listen to me now.
I've gone the extra mile with you on this.
I'm trying to work with you.
They'll be looking for that payment and if it's not there, they'll repo the car.
Yeah.
Okay, I gotta go.
Look, Jeannie, I gotta make a plane.
Just get yourself on schedule.
Okay. Make the payment.
- Let me guess. It's all my idea, right?
- Yep.
We better give her some grandkids soon so I can get her off my back.
What do you say?
Let her sweat a little.
Do you think, as a juror... you'd be able to set aside any prior opinion you might hold... about the savings-and-loan industry?
That was a question, sir.
What? Do I like bankers?
Your Honor, may I have a minute to confer with my colleagues?
You may.
Dump him.
Let's get rid of Number 4, 6, and I'd say lose Number 12... but the prosecutor will fuck up and do it for us.
Number 6?
You're kidding, right?
She's my first choice.
She's my first pass.
And 4?
With the dreadlocks? That's crazy.
- That's a defendant's juror.
- Did you see his shoes?
Look, kid, maybe down in Florida you are the next big thing.
This is New York.
We're not squeezing oranges here.
He polishes those shoes every night.
He makes his own clothes.
He looks like a brother with an attitude, but I see a man with a gun under his bed.
And woe betide the creature who steps into his garden.
Number 6... your favorite... she's damaged goods.
She's a Catholic schoolteacher, hmm?
Believes in human frailty...
No. Something's missing from her.
She's wrong.
She wants on this jury.
Somebody hurt her and she wants revenge.
How the hell do you know that?
I don't know.
Either you put a stop to this happy horseshit or I walk.
Walk.
Here's the deal: If I lose with your jury, you do the explaining.
Your Honor, may I continue?
We'd like to excuse
Jurors 3, 4 and 6.
Hi. You're home early for a change.
I just happened to find out...
I was pregnant on the same day that I got the show.
Your mother called.
She has her bad feeling.
Every now and then, she gets one right.
You okay?
Something's up.
They deliberated for 38 minutes.
Kevin.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
What the hell did they expect?
The man is as guilty as can be.
Wasn't a jury anywhere gonna let him off.
Yeah.
Except one.
What?
Kev.
Not fucking guilty!
- Oh, my God. You lying sack of shit.
- Ha, ha.
Thirty-eight minutes, my jury.
Yes!
Thirty-eight minutes.
- You did it!
- My jury. I'm too good.
- Glad you could stick around.
- It's your dime.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Mr. Milton got pinned down in Indonesia longer than expected.
Good morning, Caprice.
Good morning, Mr. Heath.
Your messages.
Not bad?
You can play it cool if you want... but when I first walked in, my jaw was on the floor.
Thank you.
This is our home office.
We have many international arrangements... so Mr. Milton spends a great deal of his time in the air.
- Three o'clock, we got the Greeks.
- Am I good cop or bad cop?
We may not need a good cop.
Oh, I love it.
In addition to our corporate clients we're representing 25 foreign countries:
The Mideast, the Balkans,
Central America, West Africa...
Interesting work, but travel-intensive.
Behind you.
I'm sorry.
Please. Kevin Lomax.
- John Milton.
- Nice to meet you.
So?
Have we been treating you well?
Very well, thank you.
And your wife, she had a good time?
She sure has. It's been great.
The whole thing's been great.
That's our secret:
Kill you with kindness.
What's your secret?
I couldn't say.
You were a prosecutor.
Out of law school.
Five years in the Jacksonville DA's office.
Sixty-four straight convictions.
What a number.
I like to be in court.
I didn't plea out a lot.
What's that like?
One day you put them away, the next you set them free.
Takes a little getting used to.
- Pays better, though, doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.
That math teacher, the Gettys case.
Now, I hear you were brilliant.
Prosecutor dropped the ball.
Really?
You think your guy was guilty?
I didn't say that.
What'd you say?
How's this:
I began the case with a clear conscience.
I was sure you had a secret.
The men's room.
Upstairs men's room in the Duval County courthouse.
There's a hole in the wall to the next room.
I spent five years listening to juries deliberate.
- I love it.
- Love it all you want.
Just don't repeat it.
I'm not sure the Florida Bar Association would appreciate it.
My lips are sealed.
You don't really want to go back to Florida, do you?
Walk with me.
What do you think?
Some people can't handle it.
It's peaceful.
My sentiments exactly.
Ha, ha. So fill in the résumé for me.
Tell me... your father, what does he do?
I never got to know my father.
He passed away before I was born.
My mother raised me. Just the two of us.
- She never remarried?
- She wasn't married the first time.
That can't be easy in a town like Gainesville, can it?
I don't think it's easy anywhere.
Holy shit.
Different when you're looking down, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
Oh, my God.
Your mother... what's she like?
She's a preacher's daughter.
She's tough.
She's worked in a poultry plant for as long as I can remember.
She's got a church she really likes, so she's usually there or they go out.
They do a lot of volunteer work.
Behold, I send you out as sheep amidst the wolves.
So they say.
It didn't rub off?
The Book? The Church?
No, I'm on parole.
Early release for time served.
A lot of potential clients down there.
Are we negotiating?
Always.
Can I ask you a question, then?
Why do you need a criminal department?
Our clients break the law like anyone else.
I'm just tired of sending their business across the street.
- Are you offering me a job?
- I'm thinking about it.
I know you've got talent.
I knew that before you got here.
It's just the other thing I wonder about.
What thing is that?
Pressure.
It changes everything. Pressure.
Some people, you squeeze them, they focus.
Others fold.
Can you summon your talent at will?
Can you deliver on a deadline?
Can you sleep at night?
When do we talk about money?
Money?
Yeah.
That's the easy part.
They call this part of Fifth Avenue,
Carnegie Hill.
Got the park right across the street, and the reservoir.
Best jogging in New York.
Mount Sinai Hospital is up the street.
Some excellent schools.
Not on the top of Mr. Milton's list when he bought this building... but great neighborhood for children.
Great building.
Follow the money all the way to the top.
You got the managing director,
Eddie Barzoon, on 16.
And, of course, Mr. Milton has the tower.
- You must be Mary Ann.
- Yes, I am.
Welcome. I'm Jackie Heath.
It's nice of you to come by.
Oh, please. We live across the hall.
- You're kidding.
- Right there.
It's just two apartments per floor?
- You didn't tell them about it?
- It can speak for itself.
Voilà.
Oh, my God.
It's what they call a Classic Eight.
Be careful. I don't have a map.
I don't want you to get lost.
We had them paint it white. Let you see it naked before you pick your palette.
What am I picking?
Palette. Your colors.
Oh, yes.
I need to warn you about one thing.
There are going to be some very envious people down at the firm.
There aren't many of these apartments.
They're a partner's perk.
You must've made quite an impression.
Oh, my God, three bedrooms.
You know what that means?
Babies.
- It took us six years to get in here.
- Oh, wow.
Unbelievable.
- Thank you very much.
- Jackie.
Kevin.
Are you really this good?
I sure as hell hope so.
They must want you pretty bad.
Look, Mar...
I'm only getting behind this if you're on board.
If you want to go home...
I'm with you.
Sure.
Let's go back to Gainesville, back to the condo.
You keep scrounging for clients and
I'll keep repossessing cars for Akamian.
And maybe, just maybe, if we kill ourselves... in about five years we can afford a baby and a weekend shack at Gulf Shores.
Are you shitting me?
I love you.
I love you too.
Tadashi Osumi, Media.
Walter Krasna, Maritime Law.
Bashir Toabal, Energy Law.
I run the Islamic subgroup.
Joyce Rensaleer,
Mergers and Acquisitions.
Eddie Barzoon, Managing Director... and Real Estate.
Pradeed Resh, Intellectual Properties.
Christabella Andrioli,
International Trade and Customs...
EC and G7.
There it is, Kevin.
The whole team.
Welcome to Milton,
Chadwick and Waters.
So, what do you think?
You can change the furniture if you like.
I guess it'll do.
Until something better comes along?
Kevin Lomax, Pam Garrety.
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.
Pam was at the Brooklyn DA's office
14 years... so she knows her way around the local scene.
You'll expedite his bar application?
It's in the pipeline.
For now, you'll work pro hac vice.
I petitioned Florida for a letter of good conduct.
And I prepared, at Mr. Milton's request, an overview of the Moyez case.
The Moyez case?
Move, move, move!
What do you think?
It's a health-code case and it's a loser.
So, what's the point?
He wants to see if I'll plea-bargain.
It's a test, right?
Isn't everything?
It's an 18th-century Italian silk damask... with an embossed floriated pattern of undulating acanthus leaves.
Lovely, isn't it?
And this is about what?
The price?
Oh, it's about 2000 a panel.
We'll take it. At 1400.
You made it.
Hey, baby.
I thought you said it was impossible.
I thought you said it was important.
Go get them.
Go get them, man.
Tell him, "Cut that shit down."
I know what they're doing over there.
That's right.
Tell him, "Take all that noise back to Africa."
Good afternoon.
I'm looking for Philippe Moyez.
Look, I'm not sure
I'm making myself clear.
Moyez, you need him?
To speak with him?
Show him your boots.
You're saying he's down here in the basement?
In the dark?
Where do you think I'm taking you?
Ha, ha.
I thought I would recognize you... but I do not.
Mr. Moyez?
We've never met.
I'm Kevin Lomax. I'm a lawyer.
I'm here about the animals.
We have an investment in blood.
Think of it as spiritual currency.
Spiritual currency.
Look, Mr. Moyez,
I'm going to need your help with this.
What is the name of the man... who will prosecute us?
Merto.
Assistant District Attorney Arnold Merto.
What are you doing, Mr. Moyez?
With this tongue, we create silence.
You can go now.
You will have all the help...
I can give you... against Monsieur Merto.
It's arbor green. What do you think?
Not with your complexion.
New York City health codes.
- That's all of it?
- Not quite.
Thanks.
Caribbean green.
Something cooler, maybe. Cooler.
A cooler green.
Too institutional.
I love green.
I love it but it's one thing to wear it and another to have it on your walls.
I'm just trying to help. It's your walls.
Do what you want.
Remember, it's only a health-code case.
Good night.
This is the first time since I've been 13 years old I don't have a job... or two.
I feel like I'm floating around in that place.
You know, just drifting around or something.
You'll settle in.
We had this little office in the condo...
- Thanks.
- Mm-hm.
You know, his side and my side.
Real nice.
At night, I'd go to sleep,
I'd see that light on...
If I want to see Leamon...
I make an appointment.
You're kidding, right?
God, how do you handle it?
Take a look around, honey.
Look, you've got three choices.
The Holy Trinity:
You can work... you can play... or you can breed.
That's a veal roast, Your Honor.
USDA approved and stamped.
Men kill animals and eat their flesh.
Philippe Moyez killed a goat.
He killed a goat.
And he did it at home... in a manner consistent with his religious beliefs.
Now, Mr. Merto may find that bizarre.
It's certainly not a religious practice performed by everyone.
It's not as common as, say... circumcision.
It's not as common as the belief that... wine transforms into blood.
Some people handle poisonous snakes to prove their faith.
Some people walk on fire.
Philippe Moyez killed a goat.
And he did it... while observing his constitutionally protected... religious beliefs.
Your Honor, this case is not about keeping goats... or transporting goats or goat licensing.
The city was less concerned with the care of the animals... than the manner with which they were slaughtered.
Objection!
Okay. Enough, enough. I got it.
Let's wrap it up.
Your Honor... the city timed this police action to catch my client... exercising his constitutionally protected right to religious freedom.
This is a law protecting kosher butchering.
Exactly, Your Honor.
I'd like to move at this time for a verdict of dismissal.
I happen to know a little bit about kashruth law, Mr. Lomax.
I'm aware of that, Your Honor.
That's why I feel confident in requesting a dismissal.
Mr. Merto?
- Your Honor...
- Mr. Merto.
For God's sake, man...
- Congratulations. Great job.
- Thanks.
Bravo! Bravo!
Pamela, you look lovely.
So, Philippe... satisfied?
Always, Jean.
Kevin.
What can I say?
Outstanding.
Go figure it, a guy like Moyez... living in some subterranean shithole... all the while he's walking around with $15 million in the bank.
You're kidding.
What do you think he's paying us in?
Goat's blood?
Tarzan, we're billing you out at 400 an hour, my friend.
I don't see a whole lot of pro-bono work in your immediate future.
I figured you came down to make sure
I didn't fuck this up.
Maybe I did.
Don't get too cocky, my boy.
No matter how good you are... don't let them see you coming.
That's the gaffe, my friend.
You've gotta keep yourself small.
Innocuous.
Be the little guy.
You know, the nerd, the leper... the shitkicking surfer. Look at me.
Underestimated from day one.
You'd never think I was a master of the universe, would you?
That's your only weakness, as far as I can see.
What's that?
It's the look.
That Florida stud thing. What is that?
Excuse me, ma'am.
Did I leave my boots under your bed?
Never worked a jury that didn't have a woman.
You know what you're missing?
You're missing what I have.
There's this beautiful girl, just fucked me 40 ways from Sunday... we're done, she's walking to the bathroom, trying to walk... she turns... she looks... it's me.
Not the Trojan army that just fucked her.
Little old me.
She gets this look on her face like:
"How the hell did that happen?"
I'm the hand up Mona Lisa's skirt.
I'm a surprise, Kevin.
They don't see me coming.
That's what you're missing.
- Where's the chicken?
- What?
There's a chicken, plays tic-tac-toe... never loses. He's famous.
Never loses, like you.
Tic-tac-toe.
Come on. I'll show you the fastest way uptown.
Learn the subways, Kevin.
Use them.
Stay in the trenches.
Only way I travel.
Mar?
What happened to the green?
- I loved the green.
- Honey, you're late.
We're due up at the Barzoon's palace in 15 minutes.
What's all this?
All what?
Jackie says the "who's who" of New York is gonna be there tonight.
- All this?
- Oh, that.
It was going to be a nursery... then I remembered you'd have to be home long enough to knock me up.
So now I'm thinking of building a law library.
Oh, baby.
Oh, tell me I can handle this.
You can handle this.
- Say something nice.
- Something nice.
Promise me you won't leave me alone in there.
I promise.
Mm.
There you are.
Hi.
Diana Barzoon. Eddie's wife.
Nice to meet you, sorry we're late.
Kevin Lomax, Health Code Warrior.
All hail.
- Mr. Barzoon, this is Mary Ann.
- Nice to meet you.
Well, Kevin, here they are.
Top of the food chain and dinner is served.
I throw these parties twice a year.
Stock market, real estate, politics. They're all players, and they're all prospects.
Kevin, congratulations.
Remember Rashid? Just in from Beirut.
Congratulations.
Bright young lights.
Oh, oh, you're going to like this.
Come on.
Somebody I want you to meet.
Kevin and Mary Ann Lomax, this is Senator Alfonse D'Amato.
Ambassador Charles Gagano.
In case you didn't know, these are the Republicans of New York.
Barzoon always overstates things.
Donald Trump was supposed to be here, but he had a business emergency.
Probably Mort Zuckerman.
I knew I'd find you here.
I'd like you to meet my wife.
Mary Ann, this is Pam Garrety.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- We're partners in crime.
- Someone you must meet.
Excuse me. This is important.
- You are so beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.
- I heard you met the senator.
- Yes, I did.
- I was married to him.
- Oh, really?
Kidding.
I'd like you to meet Kevin Lomax.
Kevin is from Florida.
- He's new to the firm.
- Nice to meet you.
The senator cannot leave.
Who's that with the senator?
- Oh, God, girl.
- You haven't met him yet?
No, who is he?
I swear he can hear us.
Hell, he can smell us.
Mary Ann...
John Milton.
I was hoping I'd see you here tonight.
And here you are.
Already swimming with the sharks.
Careful, hon.
Harry, if you keep thinking small, we'll never make any money on you.
These parties don't come cheap.
Call him. Talk to him.
See what they have to say.
Just get it on tape.
It's a wonderful opportunity for Kevin.
Yes, Kevin.
He's going to do all right if he... buys a few new suits... learns a few new tricks... he's there.
It's you. What about you?
Your family, you've got to miss them.
No?
I told Kevin the only thing worse than not having a father was having mine.
I can relate.
I can, believe me.
- Thanks.
- Thank you, sir.
The worst vice is advice.
But may I make a suggestion?
It's a sensitive...
It's about your hair, that's why I ask.
No, go ahead.
- I mean, you don't like it?
- No.
I like it fine. It's beautiful.
It's just...
It doesn't belong to you.
You're too alive for a perm.
It's not you.
You should pull your hair back.
Do it. See what happens.
Right now, here, you want me to pull my hair back?
- Is that so terrible?
- Ha, ha.
I'd love to do it, but if I did... everyone in this room who's pretending not to be watching us... would naturally assume we were fucking or something.
Please.
Okay.
It's fun to be right.
Excuse me.
It's a vision.
You've gotta cut your hair.
Are you serious?
A woman's shoulders are the frontlines of her mystique.
And her neck... if she's alive... has all the mystery of a border town.
A no man's land... in that battle... between the mind and the body.
You know... your natural color would really... bring out your eyes.
Do you have this view?
Sorry?
From your terrace, do you have this view?
Not exactly.
No terrace and I'm about...
12 floors down.
What about you?
No, I live downtown.
This is a... family building.
Sounds like fun.
Downtown, I mean.
I'm just getting to know the city.
Is it everything you expected?
More.
I say we ride them as far as we can, and then eat them.
Excuse me, Jackie.
Have you guys seen Kevin anywhere?
No. I'm sure he's around.
Okay, thanks.
Are you alone?
You mean, tonight?
Is your wife a jealous woman,
Mr. Lomax?
Oh, dear, I'm going to scare you away.
No. No, really...
I'm fine.
- Yeah?
- I'm fine.
Bet you like to be on top.
- Don't you?
- Excuse me?
Of the situation.
You prefer to be on top, right?
Depends on the view.
You know what I see?
I see the future... of this law firm.
We need to talk, Kevin.
Something's come up.
But first I want you to find
Heath and Eddie Barzoon.
Bring them up to my place. Do it quietly.
Quickly.
No problem. Arnold has a few reporters in his pocket.
We'll plant a story and destroy his credibility.
Pam, have you seen Kevin?
- No, I haven't, sweetie.
- Okay.
If he doesn't come to us, he'll regret it.
Come on.
Is there more to it?
Just this room.
And a bedroom?
Nope. No bedroom.
- Where does he sleep?
- Who says he sleeps?
Where does he fuck?
Everywhere.
What's up, John?
Leamon, how many hours did we bill
Alex Cullen for last year?
What did he do now?
Alex Cullen has just been charged with murdering his wife... her stepson... and a maid.
When did this happen?
Just now. Tonight.
I've sent Pam downtown to make bail arrangements.
They're gonna fucking crucify him.
They're gonna line up. I gotta call Meisel.
No, no, no.
I want Kevin on this case.
I hope you're kidding.
Alexander Cullen in a Manhattan triple murder with, excuse me, Kevin?
Ha! You're dreaming.
You know, I've shaken hands... with every marquee defense attorney in this town.
I'd take Kevin and I don't look back.
John, you've got a great eye for talent.
You're the master, but you know,
I just don't see this happening.
I want you on board, Eddie.
I appreciate the vote of confidence, but maybe Eddie has a point here.
We can get this case.
The man's our client.
He's a business client.
We know him better than he knows himself.
We've got the inside track.
We've got the best damn trial lawyer in the city. It's ours to lose.
Well.
Tell that to Cullen.
I want Kevin to tell him.
There's Pam.
You gonna fight for this thing or not?
Pam?
No, it's Kevin.
Hi. No, it's okay. I'm on it. Yeah.
Where are we at?
You left me there.
I had a fucking panic attack until Jackie told me where you were.
Three hours, you don't even call?
Stop.
Reset.
I'm upstairs. I'm with Milton,
Heath and Barzoon.
There's a good possibility I'm about to catch a triple-homicide defendant... who also happens to be... one of the largest real-estate developers in this city.
Mar, I had to bail on the party.
You bailed on me.
Mar.
- Did you hear me?
- I was all by myself.
For three whole hours.
The next time you make a promise, try and keep it.
You gotta be kidding me, right?
Go to hell. And you can go to sleep on the fucking couch!
- You sure he's up there?
- Yeah, CNN passed the word.
Look at this.
I'm not out 20 minutes, and I'm being followed by the press.
They're like insects.
Alex, just calm down and listen, okay?
I don't know. Maybe you're right.
Maybe he is a whiz kid, but Jesus Christ.
This is my ass we're talking about, John.
Eddie?
Alex, you know how this town works.
You've got enemies here you haven't heard from.
Now, with this... now that you're down...
I'd get ready for one of those...
Class-A, New York-style pigfucks.
You know what's coming.
Now you're going to have to ask yourself, who do you trust?
Who do you trust, Alex?
I don't know.
I'm gonna have to look around.
You don't have time to shop, Mr. Cullen.
Jury selection started today at every breakfast table in the city.
This is what people know:
Three dead bodies.
You discover the crime.
You call it in. You've got blood on your person and clothes.
And, Mr. Cullen...
Your prints are on the murder weapon.
How do you know that?
There's a second print in blood.
It's a partial of a hand on the wall next to the bodies.
I have keys. I called the cops from the house. I touched the goddamn wall.
I panicked. I was panicked.
We need 12 people who can see past all that.
- I touched the goddamn wall.
- I'd get in front of this fast.
I panicked. Is that a crime?
I didn't kill anybody.
This is a nightmare.
How am I going to convince anybody?
I'm innocent.
He's right, Alex.
People need to hear these things.
Christ, Eddie. Jesus.
You're not happy tomorrow?
The next day?
We'll move over.
But right now, this moment... you need immediate representation.
I have a 14-year-old stepdaughter... who I care more about than anything in this world.
They wouldn't let me talk to her from downtown.
They won't let me talk to her now that I'm out.
We need to issue a statement.
He's a winner, Alex.
Just like you were.
And they'll never see him coming.
Jesus Christ.
I've got some tough phone calls
I've got to...
All right.
My place, tomorrow.
Alone.
You better be every fucking inch as good as he says you are.
Not if they were giving it away.
Come on, Mary Ann.
Let's check out Yoshi's.
- Andrea?
- Yes?
Another one of these, please.
Right away.
- No, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes...
I want you loose and pliable this afternoon.
Get another bottle of chardonnay for Mrs. Barzoon and Mrs. Heath.
Oh, Lord, this is $3000.
You know what you should do?
You should buy it... wear it once, and then throw it away.
That will loosen you up.
I say spend it all.
If you never see your husband, have a relationship with his money.
- Ha, ha.
- I swear... if Eddie wasn't afraid of me shouting my mouth off... he would've put a cellulite clause in the pre-nup.
Dr. Robert, I'm telling you... he's a miracle man.
You've seen my new tits.
Who does it better than that?
It's not my tits I'm worried about.
Not too big...
Perfect.
Real or not?
They look real.
They must be real.
Feel them.
Oh, no, it's okay, really.
Go ahead. That's the ultimate test.
Come on.
Oh.
Feel real?
Yes, absolutely real.
Dr. Robert.
When you're ready.
Oh, God.
So, what do you think?
I don't care if they can hear me.
I don't care!
I don't like it here, Kevin.
And these women. My God, I mean,
I'm seeing things for Christ's sake.
- You just left them in the store?
- Yes!
- Calm down.
- No!
- Listen to me. Mar.
- No!
Mar!
First...
You do this radical thing to your hair.
Oh, you hate it.
Stop. I think it's fine.
I think it's fine.
But I also think it's traumatic.
You've got the pressure of fitting in with new friends.
A new place.
- Add to that a couple bottles of wine.
- No.
No. It wasn't the wine, Kevin.
It wasn't the wine, or my hair, or talking to Kathy... or anything like that.
Because I know that's what you're gonna say.
What about Kathy?
What about your sister?
- What about her? She's pregnant again.
- Oh.
That's got nothing to do with this?
Kevin, I never see you anymore.
And now that you've got this big case, it's just only gonna get worse.
If you can believe it...
I'm actually looking forward to having your mother come and visit.
What about the apartment?
Goddamn you!
Why do you always change things around?
This is not about the apartment.
I hate this stupid place!
You know... you buy a couple new suits and you're fine.
It's a little more than that.
I have this whole fucking place to fill!
I know we have all this money and it's supposed to be fun, but it's not.
It's like a test.
The whole thing is like one big test.
And God...
I am so lonely.
I miss you so much.
I'm sorry, baby.
I don't know what to do.
Let's make a baby.
Don't tease me.
I wouldn't do that.
Not unless you asked.
Oh, baby.
Do you have this view?
Kevin.
Make love to me.
Kevin. What are you doing?
Stop. Stop.
Oh, God.
God. Where are you?
I'm right here.
No, you're not.
- Why do we have to keep going?
- Because it needs to be clear.
Because I need to know and understand exactly... what happened.
You're standing there, you look down... there's the gun.
I don't know why I picked it up.
It was before I saw Lucinda's body.
You kneeled down to pick it up?
You work late, you come home, you walk in, everybody's dead.
It's not something you plan for.
Stop. Back up.
Two prints by the gun.
"Right hand.
Right knee."
Right knee.
We've been over this.
I'm trying to picture it.
Your hand...
Your hand came from... inside and underneath?
Do you want to see it? Here.
I'll fucking show you.
There. Did you see it? Was it clear?
You got it?
Whose gun is that?
- It's mine.
- Are you out of your mind?
You're charged with a triple homicide, you're walking around with a gun?
I have had nine death threats.
Give it over. Give me the gun.
I gotta protect myself.
That's my job. When the case is over, you can have it back.
This is a deal breaker, Alex.
Okay.
Let's wrap it up.
So, what's next?
We need to talk to your assistant,
Mrs. Black.
Call her.
You feel confident she'll back you on the time?
Melissa, yeah, yeah.
She's okay. She's a straight arrow.
Okay.
We're going to talk to her... and you're not going to talk to anybody, all right?
All right?
No comment.
There they are.
Kevin, how about a couple shots?
How does it feel to get the biggest murder trial in New York?
Look over here. Are you really going to plead Cullen not guilty?
What is happening?
Since the case,
Kevin's picture's been in the paper.
Well, he always did like to stick his nose in the camera.
- Sorry about that.
- No problem.
Mrs. Lomax, did you have a nice dinner?
Oh, I surely did. Are you hungry?
- Oh, no, ma'am. Thank you.
- Oh. Ha, ha.
Welcome to Babylon, Ma.
Speak of the devil.
I was just telling them the Moyez story.
Really?
This is your mother?
Yes, Mom, this is...
- John Milton.
- John Milton.
Alice Lomax.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
How do you do?
Mary Ann.
- You're looking lovely.
- Thanks.
This is...
I believe you met Christabella.
Yes, I think we did.
And Gizelle.
Fresh in from Paris.
Great.
Nice to meet you.
Three for you and my place.
Thanks for the champagne.
Oh, you're very welcome, Kevin.
This isn't really your first visit to New York, now, is it, Mrs. Lomax?
Yes.
You've done one hell of a job bringing him up, Mrs. Lomax.
And I'm sure it wasn't easy.
No.
- Mom, we're here.
- Yes.
- Good night to you.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night, Mary Ann.
Kevin, hang on.
Oh, how about Cullen? How's it going?
Everything on beam?
That's a long conversation.
Want to come up and tell me?
Now?
Let's talk tomorrow.
You sure?
Yeah.
Is that what you're doing when you're working late?
- What're you talking about?
- You know exactly what I'm talking about.
- That's ridiculous.
- Yeah, right.
I'm going to bed.
- Good night, Alice.
- Night.
Oh, shit.
Mom.
Mom, what are you doing?
I'm going home.
What? What are you talking about?
I don't feel right.
Look, you just got here.
And I just got my teeth kicked in on the front page, so I gotta run.
We'll talk later, okay?
Okay?
I have to go, Kevin.
I miss my church.
This is New York. There must be
20,000 churches. Take your pick.
You need to do a better job with Mary Ann.
She is not well.
- This place is not good for her.
- So stay.
Take care of her, if you're so concerned.
Help me out.
I'll take her home if you let me.
This is home. Understand?
This is where we live.
I'm not going back to Gainesville.
Unbelievable.
Wide is the gate... and broad is the way that leadeth to temptation.
It's a little early for Scripture.
I'm going to work.
You can do whatever you want.
Does my babysitter have to testify?
We need her to establish the time you returned home.
She doesn't have a green card, is why I ask.
I would hate for her to get in trouble.
Tell you what, Melissa.
Let's talk to her first. See where she stands and take it from there.
I'll make sure
Melissa gets down to the car.
- Thanks, Pam.
- Mr. Cullen didn't kill those people.
I know him. He's a difficult man, but he couldn't kill anyone.
That's why we're all working so hard.
Thank you.
Can I have the car stop at my ex-husband's?
- My son left his jacket there.
- Sure.
George, remember, no shredding in the building trash.
- Only in the private refuse.
- Yes, sir.
Excelsior Securities, who's handling that?
- I am.
- All this has got to go.
Guatemala, Sudan, Cyprus...
Mark. No, no, no.
Vagada Holdings, it'll take you all night.
Just Vagada Holdings.
I thought I was the only one working late.
Well, so did we.
Back to work. This is not a break.
Good news.
We just wrapped up with Cullen's assistant.
Looks like a great alibi.
What a pleasant surprise.
Looks like you've got your hands full.
Oh, it's just a little... housekeeping.
If anyone should ask... you never saw this.
Who would ask?
- Weaver.
- Who's that?
Justice Department. Weaver Commission.
- You don't know about Weaver?
- Sorry.
How nice for you.
Grab your coat. The night is young.
We're going to the Garden. Ringside.
Title fight.
Roy Jones Jr.
- I'd have to call Mary Ann.
- Do it on the way.
Get my message?
I did. You write beautifully.
What's this Weaver Commission?
I don't like to micro-manage.
Find the talent, then delegate.
Who the hell knows what Eddie's up to?
He's got a lot of fingers in a lot of pies.
Excuse me.
What the fuck are you looking at?
You. You deaf or something?
You don't hear me?
I hear you fine.
So get the fuck out of my car.
Why? I didn't know it was your car.
I'm having a good time here.
Motherfucker, I'm telling you...
- ...get the fuck out of my car...
- Shit.
Get out before I cut your throat.
Fuck that.
How do you know...?
Enjoy yourself. You still got time.
There's a train coming the other way.
You'll just catch it.
You'll thank me in the morning.
- You ain't right, man.
- Oh, I'm right.
You'll see.
Invigorating.
What did you say to him?
I told him if he didn't leave us alone, you'd kick his ass.
Look, there's a lady getting up from her seat. Come on.
Get some! You wanna lose?
You are on!
No, no, no.
Roy's gonna get him. Now, now, now.
Fixed!
- What a beauty.
- I'm glad you could come.
I want you to meet my new heavyweight, here: Kevin Lomax.
- Kevin Lomax. How are you?
- I'm well.
And say what?
He's the senior partner at the...
Mar, you're really starting to piss me off.
Yes, I'm having one cigarette.
You want me to lie?
One cigarette after seven months is not...
That's exactly what I'm saying.
Go to bed. I have no idea.
Ho! Ha!
Stop. This guy pays our bills.
The food, the heat, the rent on that enormous apartment we live in.
I live there too.
Mar.
Give it back to me.
I play the trumpet too.
Kevin.
Babs Coleman.
Kevin Lomax.
Babs is from Georgia Tech.
It's your neck of the woods.
There's Tiffany.
New additions. Where are you from?
Don't tell me.
Michigan.
How'd you know? Oh, my goodness.
How did he know?
That is so good.
Cheers.
Kevin?
Honey?
Hello?
Who's there?
I got a knife.
Oh, Jesus.
Baby... how'd you get here?
Are you okay?
Oh, God.
Where's your mommy?
You ain't got no mommy?
What do you got there?
What are you playing with?
What are you playing with?
Oh, God!
Oh, God! No! God!
Baby, please.
Baby, there is no blood.
There is no blood. It was a dream.
It was a dream.
It's not a dream if it's true.
Look, let's get you undressed and in the tub, okay?
No.
I know you.
You'll leave me now for sure.
No! Get away from me.
Okay.
Okay, I'm... I'm confused.
Why?
What is it now?
Did you like the green?
You did, didn't you?
We should go back to the green.
I'm calling the doctor.
I'm going to get you some help.
They took my ovaries, Kevin.
What?
They took my ovaries!
I told you. Right here.
Mary Ann, it was a nightmare.
It didn't happen.
My sisters have seven children between them.
My mother had Derek when she was 45.
You could've set a clock by my periods.
Baby... what are you talking about?
Kevin, I can't have children.
What?
Says who?
The doctor.
I was there yesterday.
Non-specific ovarian failure.
That's ridiculous.
Oh, God.
Did you just hear that?
Listen.
Can you hear that?
No.
You're going to leave me, aren't you?
Mary Ann.
I know you.
God...
No, Kevin.
It's these monsters.
I dreamt about this.
Baby, I gotta take this.
No, you've gotta listen to me.
- It's okay, it's okay.
- Why do...?
I gotta take this.
It's going to be okay.
Yeah.
Fuck!
I knew the DA was holding out on us.
Get the discovery package over here, right now.
Mm-hm. I don't care. Find Cullen.
I get one supervised hour a week with my stepdaughter.
I am in there with two shrinks and three social workers.
You better have a good reason for calling me out.
Your wife, the day she was killed, had lunch with a friend.
She says, and I quote: "Alex is fucking around and I can prove it."
That's hearsay. That never gets in.
Wrong answer.
Your prenuptial agreement's on file at the firm.
The contract is void in the event of marital infidelity.
You fuck around, she gets rich.
That's a motive, Alex.
What do I need to know?
Melissa, my assistant.
She wasn't even that good a fuck.
And... on the night in question?
I was boning my assistant the night my wife got shot.
I've got to re-interview Melissa.
No, forget it. We're not telling that story.
Juries want honesty.
Fuck with that at your peril.
- Alessandra, wait.
- Alex...
- Alessandra.
- Alex.
Not now. Mrs. Skylar, please.
Time's up, Mr. Cullen.
- Alex.
- I can't.
This isn't fair. I had 15 more minutes.
You'll just have to wait until next week.
- I'll see you next week.
- That's it, I'm sorry.
For sleep.
And she can take that during the day?
No, she won't be driving.
I'll have the pharmacy call you right back.
He's not sure. He thinks it could be some kind of hormonal imbalance.
I'm taking you off the case.
What?
I want you to drop this case.
This case? Cullen?
- I've got a jury showing up.
- Do you love this woman?
- Of course I do.
- Then what are you doing?
She's sick.
Everyone will understand.
I'll understand.
What about Cullen?
We find somebody new.
You consult.
You live to fight another day.
What are you talking about?
I put together a great jury.
It's a disappointment. We have them.
All of us have them. You use it.
You embrace it. And then you move on.
Hang on.
We've gotta talk about this.
Aw, listen to yourself, Kevin.
"We've gotta talk about this."
It's your wife, man.
She's sick, she needs you.
She's got to come first.
All right, wait a minute.
Do you mean the possibility of leaving this case has never entered your mind?
You know what scares me?
I quit the case, she gets better... and I hate her for it.
I don't want to resent her.
I've got a winner here.
I've got to nail this fucker down and put it behind me. Just get it done.
Then... then... put all my energy into her.
I stand corrected.
Fill me in. Did Cullen's assistant admit to the affair?
She did to me, but she won't in court.
Convince her otherwise.
And when all that evidence is laid before you... when all these pieces weave together, you will conclude... you will know... that Alexander Cullen is guilty... of murdering three people... in cold blood... and with malice aforethought.
Thank you.
Your Honor.
Mr. Lomax we can break for lunch now or you can do a stop and start.
If it's a choice, I'll go now.
I won't be as long as Mr. Broygo.
Proceed.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
I know you've spent all morning listening to Mr. Broygo talk.
I know you're hungry.
What I need to tell you won't take very long at all.
I don't like Alexander Cullen.
I don't think he's a nice person.
I don't expect you to like him.
He's been a terrible husband to all three of his wives.
He's been a destructive force in the lives of his stepchildren.
He's cheated the city, his partners... his employees.
He's paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in penalties and fines.
I don't like him.
I'm going to tell you some things during the course of this trial... that are going to make you like him even less.
But this isn't a popularity contest.
It's a murder trial.
And the single most important provable fact of this proceeding... is that Alexander Cullen was somewhere else... when these horrible crimes took place.
Now, the State...
The State is going all out here.
They've got this whole team here... throwing everything but the kitchen sink at this case.
I want one thing from you.
That's it.
One thing.
I want you to ask yourself:
"Is not liking this man..." reason enough...
"...to convict him of murder?"
Enjoy your lunch.
We'll talk again.
What the fuck was that about?
They're going to hate me.
Listen to me like you've never listened to anyone before in your life.
I'm gonna bust my ass to make sure they hate you.
Because as long as you're boning Melissa, you're not home killing your wife.
Why didn't you say something before?
Then it doesn't look spontaneous.
Oh, you got it now?
- Hey. Kevin.
- Eddie.
Saw you go in.
What's up?
Congratulations.
- It's not over yet.
- I'm not talking about the trial.
What are you talking about?
How the fuck does your name get on the firm's charter?
What?
It looks like it's been there for years.
So now you're a partner.
When did that happen?
You know, I still am the managing director of this firm.
You want my job, take me head on.
You backdoor me one more time... and I'll take your partnership papers and shove them down your throat!
I don't know what you're talking about.
I sure don't like your tone.
- Bullshit.
- You got a problem with documents... put together one of your late-night shredding sessions.
You think you're tough enough to run this firm?
Ha! Remember the Weaver Commission investigation?
Tell your mentor... the next time Weaver calls me, maybe I'll just... pick up the phone.
- Was he drunk?
- I doubt it.
He was going running.
What the hell was he talking about?
Eddie's got himself in trouble again.
And he wants me to save him.
Only this time, I can't.
Why does he think I'm after his job?
You ever have any experience with manic depression?
- Not directly, no.
- You do now.
- It's me. Get Eddie Barzoon.
He may be out running, so you might have to page him.
- It's an emergency.
- Yes, sir.
You look like you could use a drink.
Yes. Yes, thanks.
Eddie Barzoon, Eddie Barzoon. Ha.
I nursed him through two divorces, a cocaine rehab... and a pregnant receptionist.
Ha. God's creature, right?
God's special creature?
I've warned him, Kevin.
I've warned him every step of the way.
Watching him bounce around like a fucking game.
Like a wind-up toy.
Like 250 pounds... of self-serving greed on wheels.
The next thousand years is right around the corner, Kevin.
Eddie Barzoon.
- Take a good look because...
- Excuse me.
He's the poster child for the next millennium.
These people, it's no mystery where they come from.
You sharpen the human appetite... to the point where it can split atoms with its desire.
You build egos the size of cathedrals.
Fiber-optically connect the world to every eager impulse.
Grease even the dullest dreams with these dollar-green... gold-plated fantasies until every human becomes an aspiring emperor... becomes his own god.
Where can you go from there?
- Hey. Wrong way.
- Yeah, yeah. Fuck you...
As we're scrambling... from one deal to the next, who's got his eye on the planet?
As the air thickens, the water sours... even bees' honey takes on the metallic taste of radioactivity... and it just keeps coming, faster and faster.
Oh, fuck! Help! Stop it!
There's no chance to think, to prepare.
It's buy futures, sell futures... when there is no future.
We got a runaway train, boy.
We got a billion Eddie Barzoons all jogging into the future.
Every one of them is getting ready to fistfuck God's ex-planet... lick their fingers clean... as they reach out toward their pristine, cybernetic keyboards... to tote up their fucking billable hours.
And then it hits home.
You gotta pay your own way, Eddie.
A little late in the game to buy out now.
Give me your watch.
What? I like this watch.
Do you think you're just going to take it?
Your belly's too full, your dick is sore... your eyes are bloodshot and you're screaming for someone to help.
But guess what? There's no one there.
You're all alone, Eddie.
You're God's special little creature.
No.
Maybe it's true.
Maybe God threw the dice once too often.
Maybe he let us all down.
You testified the defendant called you at 4:30... to ask you to come to his office gym for the purposes of sex.
Yes.
Mr. Cullen, though, he's not just your lover, is he?
He's the boss.
Yes.
So two hours go by before you act on his request?
Yes, I went up at 6: 10.
I knew it was 6:10 because I heard the weather coming on the news...
Okay, stop.
This prosecutor is no fool.
He's going to change tempo, attitude, tone of voice.
He's going to come out with questions you never thought of just to screw you up.
So, what do we do?
Yes and no answers. Stay calm.
Exactly.
Is it your testimony, Ms. Black, that between the hours of 6:10 and 9:40... you were engaged in sexual congress with the defendant?
Yes.
At any point during this three-hour marathon... did you lose sight of the defendant?
- No.
- Did he use the bathroom?
- Yes.
- Is he circumcised?
- You understand the question?
- Yeah.
So is he cut or not?
Yes.
Which is it?
You've polished his knob three times a week for six months.
- You don't know if he has foreskin?
- I've had enough of your fucking game!
Why don't you take your questions and shove them up your ass?
Kevin.
What's happening?
- It's Eddie Barzoon.
- What about him?
He's dead. He was killed.
- When?
- Last night. In the park.
He was running, if you can believe it.
What is wrong with people?
At least they got the scumbags who did it.
Who?
Two old homeless crazies.
Kevin. I'm sorry, you're due in court in 30 minutes.
- Get your things together.
- Are we finished here or what?
I'll bring Melissa down to the car.
You better get going.
I want you to put Eddie aside.
Let me worry about it.
You've got to deal with Cullen.
You've got to marshal your strength.
Prioritize. Conserve your energy.
I can't put her on the stand.
- What choice do you have?
- I know she's lying.
She's lying because she didn't answer you fast enough? She lied to you? No.
She said nothing.
Fact is, you'll never know anyway.
He killed those people.
You really believe that?
He set me up.
Cullen fucking set me up.
Melissa, the whole thing.
I know it.
Gotta go with your gut.
That's your advice?
I'll back you either way.
Maybe it's your time to lose.
Think I haven't lost before?
Kevin.
We talked about this, remember?
Pressure.
Take a big whiff.
All rise.
The Honorable Armand Poe presiding.
Please be seated.
All right, Mr. Lomax, you may present your case.
Mr. Lomax.
I call Melissa Black.
Raise your right hand.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth...
- So help you God?
- I do.
Kevin!
I have maintained my innocence all along, now you see proof.
Feeney, it's him.
She didn't look well.
Felix tried to talk to her.
- Where is she?
- Church of the Heavenly Hope.
Honey.
Mar, it's me.
What happened?
Are you okay?
He let himself in. You need to know that.
Who let himself in?
The bath was running or something.
I didn't hear him. I swear to you.
And then we talked.
And we talked for hours.
And I haven't talked to anyone... really talked to anyone in so long.
Did somebody hurt you?
Yeah.
Who?
Milton.
What?
He...
He...
He fucked me.
And I think I wanted him to, but then I just...
I don't know, I just couldn't stop him.
He just wouldn't stop.
When?
- Baby, when?
- Today.
The whole afternoon.
I'm so ashamed.
Today?
Yeah.
Today?
Today he was in court.
He was in court in my presence all afternoon!
- No!
- Yes!
Yes! Yes!
No.
God, no, Kevin.
Kevin, I'm not crazy.
You have to believe me.
- No!
- Oh, Jesus.
He did this to me!
No!
He did this to me.
What did you do to yourself?
What are we going to do, baby?
What am I going to do?
Sign there. And your relationship.
She's calm now. This might be a good time to say good night to her.
I know why this is happening.
They want you to sleep.
It's the money.
Blood money.
We just drank it down, both of us.
We knew it.
Winning those cases, taking the money.
We knew they were guilty.
But you just kept on winning... every time.
I can't look at myself in the mirror.
I see a monster.
Don't do this, Kevin.
Please take me home.
Please don't do this.
I'm not crazy.
Doesn't Diana look fabulous?
- Alessandra, you look ravishing.
- Thank you.
Mrs. Skylar.
We are here today... to remember Eddie Barzoon.
Isn't she lovely?
We have gathered here to seek shelter in our common grief.
To draw strength toward our tested faith.
So, what do they say? How's Mary Ann?
They don't know.
She's...
She's falling apart.
Hallucinations.
Milton...
It's bad.
Do you have room for one more?
Beloved father. Devoted husband.
Trusted friend.
Esteemed colleague. Benevolent citizen.
All of these things.
And yet one thing more:
Child of God.
And it is to that Father that he now returns.
Eddie Barzoon... such a vibrant member of our community... has moved beyond us now.
He has entered... a new communion.
And for that it is a time of rejoicing.
God, who is our refuge and our strength.
God, who is that very present help... in time of trouble.
Therefore we will not fear... though the Earth should change... though the mountains shake in the heart of the sea... though its waters roar and foam... though the mountains tremble with its tumult.
We cannot fear too long... for Eddie Barzoon... has gone home.
Mr. Lomax?
No comment.
I'll have something for you later.
I'm a friend of Eddie Barzoon.
You don't know me, but Eddie mentioned your name.
Mitch Weaver, Justice Department?
Staking out the funeral?
Looking for you, actually.
I'm in a hurry. I need to talk to my wife.
Just wanted to ask you, off the record.
I have a few questions about Eddie.
Milton, Chadwick, Waters is a little more than a law firm.
But I assumed you knew that.
Vagada Holdings?
I'm sure you've heard of it.
London, Kinshasa, Karachi:
Arms brokering, mostly.
Munzer-Dietch, in Berlin, Djakarta:
Chemical weapons and toxic waste.
Ivanco Limited, Moscow:
Money laundering for the eastern bloc.
It goes on and on and on.
Milton is into everything.
Barzoon was coming in, Kevin.
He was going to testify.
DeSoto and Dibalista, Panama.
That firm sets up bank accounts for judges in South America.
Huge drug cases, murder, everything.
What the fuck do you want?
He's a lawyer!
Now stay off my back!
This is a first-time last-time offer,
Kevin.
I'm learning about you.
I talked to some old friends in Florida this morning.
The Gettys case?
Eighth grade teacher?
They found him yesterday.
He had the body of a 10-year-old girl in the trunk of his car.
Is he all right? Get help!
Hey, Marie, do you want to go to the party?
- Come on.
- No.
Horace will be disappointed.
It's a birthday party. We can sing.
"Or indeed, His divine power..." has granted us all things pertaining to life and piety...
"...through the knowledge of Him who has called us..."
Kevin?
What are you doing here?
I came this morning.
I kept calling the house and getting no answer.
I need to talk to you.
We got her on the first flight up this morning.
Are you all right, Kevin?
I just...
I don't know.
Would you excuse us for a moment, please?
- Sure.
- Come on, Kevin.
How you doing, sweetie?
I know something that'll make you feel better.
There.
I shouldn't have left. I knew it.
I'll never forgive myself.
- There's nothing you could've done.
- Oh, I could've told you the truth.
About what?
Baptist Endeavor Youth Crusade, 1966.
I was here in New York.
That night in the elevator, you never let me answer.
- What are you talking about?
- I stayed here a week in the Tremont Hotel.
They had a restaurant downstairs where we ate almost every meal.
Wait. Stop.
Your father was a waiter in that restaurant.
My father?
Oh, this is great, Ma.
- Honey, please listen.
- Now?
You do this now?
Because, I mean, your timing, it's superb.
You wait 30 years, you fly up here, you pick today?
Kevin, honey, just...
Obviously I'm not under enough pressure.
I don't have enough on my mind!
I need this...
Listen to me!
Kevin. Kevin.
Kevin.
Behold, I send you out as sheep amidst the wolves.
Oh. Don't you look beautiful now.
Take a look and see.
It's all right, dear. Look.
- No.
- Go on, take a look.
See how beautiful you are?
See?
Get out!
What happened?
She attacked me.
Mary Ann. Mary Ann.
Open the door.
Open the door, Mar.
Mar? Open the door. Mar.
Mar? Come on, Mar.
It's okay. Open the door!
- No!
- Mar!
Come on!
Open the door!
Mar!
Open the door, Mar!
Oh, my God! Get somebody! Go! Go!
Mar, look at me!
Somebody! Help!
No! Mar!
Pam, get help!
Go!
Mar! Sweetheart!
- Mar, look at me!
- I love you.
No, no, no!
No!
Oh, God, Mar, what have you done?
What have you done?
We need a doctor in here!
We need a doctor!
Mar, Mar, Mar, please stay with me, Mar!
Stay with me, Mar!
Get Dr. Job in here now!
Sir, get away so that I can help her. Now!
Sir, off! Go!
Come on. Come on.
- Help her.
- Out of the way.
Get Dr. Job, please! I'm losing her!
Finish the story.
1966. You were in New York.
There's a waiter in a restaurant.
Finish the story.
He talked to me.
Nobody'd ever really talked to me before.
Sixteen years old, a thousand miles away from home, someone takes an interest...
Knew the Bible, every word.
Just knew it by heart.
Every meal, there he was at my ear and I was...
That last night he came to say goodbye... and I started crying.
And he told me:
Behold, I send you out as sheep amidst the wolves.
I want to hear you say it.
- His face that night, I knew it was him.
- Say it.
You were so proud you'd just come to
New York and done this all on your own.
- Say it!
- I didn't have the heart to tell you.
- You wondered yourself. The money...
- Say it!
That apartment, the attention, everything out of nowhere.
Say it!
Milton, he's your... father.
He's your father.
Somehow he found us.
He tracked you down.
- No.
- He did.
He's always been there.
I know that now.
Watching.
Waiting.
Playing us like a game.
What do you mean?
I gotta go.
No, leave it alone. Stay here with me.
Forget about him. We can leave here.
We can go home.
We don't ever have to see him again.
I can't do it.
You go home. You go home.
- Kevin.
- I have to go.
- I have to go.
- Wait.
I love you.
- There you are.
- Pam.
Look at you. You're terrified.
Not to worry.
He'll take away that fear.
You don't ever have to be frightened again.
Go on.
He's waiting for you.
Go.
You were right about one thing.
I have been watching.
Couldn't help myself.
Watching.
Waiting.
Holding my breath.
But I'm no puppeteer, Kevin.
I don't make things happen.
Doesn't work like that.
What'd you do to Mary Ann?
Free will. It's like butterfly wings.
Once touched, they never get off the ground.
No.
I only set the stage.
You pull your own strings.
What did you do to Mary Ann?
A gun? In here?
Goddamn it, what did you do to my wife?
Well... on a scale of one to 10...
10 being the most depraved act of sexual theater known to man... one being your average
Friday night run-through at the Lomaxs'...
I'd say, not to be immodest...
Mary Ann and I got it on at about seven.
Fuck you!
Oh. Oh. Oh. Got me!
Got me! Yes!
Oh, yeah! Yeah!
Step it up, son! Come on! That's good!
You got to hold on to that fury.
That's the last thing to go.
That's the final hiding place.
It's the final fig leaf.
- Who are you?
- Who am I?
Who are you?
Never lost a case.
Why?
Why do you think?
Because you're so fucking good.
Yeah?
But why?
Because you're my father?
I'm a little more than that, Kevin.
Awfully hot in that courtroom, wasn't it?
"What's the game plan, Kevin?"
"It was a nice run, Kev."
"Had to close out some day."
"Nobody wins them all."
What are you?
Oh.
I have so many names.
Satan.
Call me Dad.
Mary Ann, she knew it.
She knew it. She knew it, so you destroyed her.
You're blaming me for Mary Ann?
Oh, I hope you're kidding.
Mary Ann, you could have saved her anytime you liked.
All she wanted was love.
Hey, you were too busy.
That's a lie.
Mary Ann in New York?
Face it, you started looking to better-deal her the minute you got here.
That's not true.
You don't know what we had.
- You don't know anything about it.
- Hey, I'm on your side.
- You're a liar!
- No, hey... Kevin.
There's nothing out there for you.
Don't be such a fucking chump.
Stop deluding yourself.
I told you to take care of your wife.
What did I say?
"The world would understand."
Didn't I say that?
What did you do?
"You know what scares me, John?
I leave the case, she gets better and then I hate her for it."
Remember?
I know what you did.
You set me up.
Who told you to pull out all the stops on Gettys?
- Who made that choice?
- It's entrapment. You set me up.
And Moyez. The direction you took.
Popes, swamis, snake handlers, all feeding at the same trough.
- Whose ideas were those?
- You played me!
It was a test! Your test!
And Cullen. Knowing he was guilty.
Seeing those pictures.
What did you do?
You put that lying bitch on the stand.
You brought me in. You put me there.
You made her lie.
I don't do that, Kevin!
That day on the subway, what did I say to you?
What were my words to you?
Maybe it was your time to lose.
You didn't think so.
Lose? I don't lose!
I win!
I'm a lawyer! That's my job.
That's what I do.
I rest my case.
Vanity... is definitely my favorite sin.
Kevin, it's so basic.
Self-love.
The all-natural opiate.
You know, it's not that you didn't care for Mary Ann, Kevin... it's just that you were a little more involved with someone else.
Yourself.
You're right.
I did it all.
I let her go.
Aw, don't be too hard on yourself, Kevin.
You wanted something more.
Believe me.
I...
I left her behind and just kept going.
You cannot keep punishing yourself,
Kevin.
It's awesome how far you've come.
I didn't make it easy.
Couldn't.
Not for you... or your sister.
Half-sister, to be exact.
Surprise.
Some scene, Kevin?
Don't let him scare you, eh?
Kevin, I've had so many children.
I've had so many disappointments.
Mistake after mistake.
And then there's you.
The two of you.
What do you want from me?
I want you to be yourself.
You know, I'll tell you, boy... guilt... it's like a bag of fucking bricks.
All you gotta do... is set it down.
Hey.
I know what you're going through.
I've been there.
Just come here. Come here.
Yeah. Let it go.
I can't do that.
Who are you carrying all those bricks for anyway?
God?
Is that it?
God?
I'll tell you... let me give you a little inside information about God.
God likes to watch.
He's a prankster.
Think about it.
He gives man... instincts.
He gives you this extraordinary gift, and then what does he do?
I swear, for his own amusement... his own private, cosmic gag reel... he sets the rules in opposition.
It's the goof of all time.
Look, but don't touch.
Touch, but don't taste.
Taste, but don't swallow.
And while you're jumping from one foot to the next, what is he doing?
He's laughing his sick fucking ass off!
He's a tightass!
He's a sadist!
He's an absentee landlord!
Worship that? Never!
Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven, is that it?
Why not?
I'm here on the ground with my nose in it since the whole thing began.
I've nurtured every sensation man has been inspired to have.
I cared about what he wanted and I never judged him.
Why? Because I never rejected him, in spite of all his imperfections.
I'm a fan of man!
I'm a humanist.
Maybe the last humanist.
Who, in their right mind...
Kevin, could possibly deny... the 20th century was entirely mine?
All of it, Kevin!
All of it!
Mine.
I'm peaking, Kevin.
It's my time now.
It's our time.
Anybody want a drink?
I'm having a drink.
This is some pitch, all this.
You must need me pretty bad.
What do you want?
Eddie was right.
I want you to take over the firm.
You... and your sister.
- Is that it?
- No.
She's ovulating...
- Right now.
- What?
Your vanity... is justified, Kevin.
Your seed... is the key to a new future.
Your son is going to sit at the head of all tables, my boy.
He's gonna set this whole thing free.
You want a child.
I want a family.
The Antichrist.
Whatever.
But I have to volunteer.
Free will, it is a bitch.
Kevin, I need a family.
I need help. I'm busy.
Millennium's coming, son.
Title fight. Round 20. Ha, ha.
I'm ready to work.
What do you say, kid?
What're you offering?
Are we negotiating?
Always.
Yes.
What are you offering?
Everything.
Anything.
What do you want?
How about bliss, for starters?
Instant bliss. Bliss on tap. Ha, ha.
Bliss any way you want it.
How about that first line of cocaine?
That walk into a strange girl's bedroom.
Familiar?
Oh, you're gonna have to do a little better than that.
I know.
I'm just getting warmed up.
You want more, don't you?
You deserve more.
How about the thing you love the most?
A smile from a jury.
That cold courtroom just giving itself over... bending to your strength.
I get that on my own.
Not like this.
I take the bricks out of the briefcase.
I give you pleasure.
No strings!
Freedom, baby... is never having to say you're sorry.
This is revolution, Kevin.
It happened in Monterey
A long time ago
Forget about him.
This is about us.
In old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips as red as wine
You don't know how hard it's been for me to wait for you.
Why the law?
Cut the shit, Dad. Why lawyers?
Why the law?
Because the law, my boy, puts us into everything.
It's the ultimate backstage pass.
It's the new priesthood, baby.
Did you know there are more students in law school... than lawyers walking the Earth?
We're coming out... guns blazing!
The two of you... all of us, acquittal after acquittal after acquittal... until the stench of it reaches so high and far into Heaven... it chokes the whole fucking lot of them.
In the Bible, you lose.
We're destined to lose, Dad.
Consider the source, son.
Besides... we'll write our own book.
Chapter one.
Right here. This altar.
This moment.
Will you stop talking?
You talk too much.
Both of you.
Kevin.
Look at me.
Just look at me.
Oh. She is really stunning.
Who am I?
I've wanted you from the moment we met.
The virtue of the devil is in his loins.
What about love?
Overrated.
Biochemically no different than eating large quantities of chocolate.
Hey. In two minutes you won't be thinking about Mary Ann ever again.
Come here.
She's right, my son.
It's time to step up and take what's yours.
You're right.
It's time.
Free will, right?
No!
- No!
- No!
No!
Damn you!
Enough!
Haven't I given enough?
It was a nice run, Kev.
Had to close out someday.
Nobody wins them all.
What are you doing, baby?
Are you okay?
I am now.
All rise.
The Honorable Judge Garson Deeds presiding.
Please be seated.
You're still under oath, young lady.
Your witness, Mr. Lomax.
Mr. Lomax?
Your Honor...
I'm terribly sorry.
But I can no longer represent my client.
I need to be replaced as counsel.
Order. Order! Order!
I adjourn this court.
This is outrageous. Are you aware of the consequences of this action?
I am, sir.
I want to see both attorneys in my chambers immediately.
I'm going to adjourn this trial until 9 a.m. Tomorrow morning.
I trusted you to defend me.
You swore you would. You'll burn for this.
You just made the biggest mistake of your life.
Baby, what are you doing?
The right thing.
I think the right thing.
Here they are.
- Are you gonna be disbarred?
- I don't know.
- How's it feel to lose your first case?
- No comment.
Ain't it better to talk to them all at once?
Press conference tomorrow?
He ain't going to talk to you now.
Eight o'clock tomorrow morning.
That's it.
This is the story you dreamed about.
- There is no story.
- Bullshit.
A lawyer with a crisis of conscience?
You gotta be kidding. It's huge.
They're going to disbar me.
Write about that.
- Wait a second. Can they do that?
- Not when I get through with the story.
You got to give me an exclusive.
This is wire service. This is 60 Minutes.
This is a story that needs to be told.
It's you.
You're a star.
Baby.
Call me in the morning.
You got it. First thing.
Bye, Larry.
Vanity.
Definitely my favorite sin.
I thought this day would never come.
Here we go, one, two, three, whoa, yeah.
Well, what do you think Todd?
- It's all right, I guess.
- It took me 10 months to build this thing.
All I get is it's all right?
- Okay, it's great.
- Dad, I think this house is amazing.
- Yeah, honey, and we're gonna be real happy here.
Give me a hug, mm, yeah.
Come on, find some of your stuff there, okay.
- If the moving trucks ever get here.
Can you believe it?
We're finally here.
- Mom, are you sure it's up to code?
- Hey, Jim, it's by the book.
- What about earthquake-proofing, Mr. Martin?
Honey, you can call him Bill.
- I made sure that your bedroom has the best view of the backyard.
Want me to show you?
- Not in a million years, Bill.
Jimmy!
Oh, just give him a chance.
He'll warm up.
- Yeah, well a million years is a long time, honey.
- Yeah, but we're worth the wait.
Mm.
- Oh, yeah.
So?
- Mm.
- Huh, nice, huh?
Here, let me show you something.
What do you think, huh?
- Uh, it's a little overwhelming, B.
- Oh, come on, this baby's a classic, huh?
User-friendly.
Let me show you.
Oh.
Uh-huh.
- Oh, I thank you.
- Hey.
- For all of this.
Mm.
- Ah, movers.
- We're home.
- Mm, yeah.
Let's go.
♪ Gotta go home
♪ Gotta go home
Whoa, nice room, man.
I assume you're going for the total geek effect.
- What do you want Todd?
- Got one of your boxes by mistake.
Now tell me this, man.
How can a kid who likes to play with rats be afraid of spiders?
- First of all, Max is a mouse.
And if you must know,
I have arachnophobia.
- Oh.
- Would you please leave.
- Man, you are one uptight little dude.
Subspecies.
Uh, damn!
- Nice going, Dad.
Years of experience.
- Claire wants you to stop messing with the lights.
Okay.
Guess I can give it a rest.
You okay, huh?
- Yeah.
- What's the problem?
- It's nothing.
- You okay?
- Yeah, it's nothing.
It's Mom.
She was supposed to call me, but she managed to forget again.
- Nah, she didn't forget.
No, it's just the difference between times in New
York and here, that's, no, it's just hard to--
- Ah, to what, pick up a phone?
- Hmm.
- You should give it up.
Truth is, she's ashamed of me.
She can't stand being around and you know it.
- Okay, you're right.
Your mother has trouble with you, but it's her problem, Todd.
It's not yours, all right, come on.
- It still hurts, you know?
Like Dad, you know, I miss it just being you and me.
This whole new family thing sucks.
- I'm just asking to give
Claire and Jimmy a chance, Todd.
That's all.
- Oh, here we go.
- Todd, this family's important to me.
- Yeah, you've only told me that about a thousand times.
- That's because you're the oldest.
So I'm counting on your help, Todd.
- Well, Claire's all right.
- Oh, good.
- But Jimmy, man.
That kid is such a wimp.
I used to eat kids like that for breakfast.
- Yeah, and because you're such a pro at getting into trouble,
I thought you'd be able to teach Jimmy how to stay out of it.
- That's not gonna be too hard.
Once a geek, always a geek.
- Okay, Mr. Wise Guy.
I'm taking that as a promise that you're gonna at least try.
- All right.
- Okay.
Come here, I wanna show you something.
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.
Come here, go long.
- Oh, this thing looks nice.
I thought you were gonna ditch this old thing.
- Yeah, yeah, I was, but I don't know, there's something about it I like.
Should we open it up?
Dying to see what's inside.
You know, you don't get out enough Dad.
- Todd?
Freedom.
Hey, Mr. Martin.
Your new house is amazing.
- Thanks, thanks, Dana.
- Look, Dad, um, you know, this is a real cool shed, but I haven't seen
Dana in about a week and she got her license and--
- Yeah, okay, okay, okay, all right, all right.
- All right.
- But just remember what we talked about, all right?
No more trouble.
- I swear.
I want you home at 11.
- No problem.
You're gonna burn.
- Hmm.
Huh.
What the hell is this?
Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- Come here, what's going on?
Hmm?
- I've been thinking about this house.
Wondering how long we're gonna be here for.
I'm tired of moving, Dad.
Ever since Mom moved away, we've lived in so many different places.
Now we're in this brand new house and I don't wanna move anymore.
- We're not going anywhere honey.
We're gonna stay right here.
- Promise?
- I promise.
Give me a hug.
It's a proven fact.
Bill is a loser.
- Gotta get your facts straight, honey.
Bill is not a loser.
- I hate it here.
I don't have any friends.
If it weren't for Max,
I'd be a total outcast.
- What am I, mashed potatoes?
- No, but you're with Bill.
And he's not half as smart as Dad was.
Sometimes I wish I could see him again.
Just one more time.
God, what a day.
- You said you worked things out with Jimmy?
- Yeah.
If you call missing your father and hating it here working it out.
What are you doing, research?
- Yeah, I can use all the help I can get.
- Honey, you just gotta relax.
- Yeah.
- And don't worry so much.
Just gotta let things happen.
- Mm-hmm.
All I can tell ya is that for the first time in three years, I have hope.
Claire, I don't wanna screw this up.
- Hey, just remember,
Mr. Sensitive,
- Mm.
- I didn't marry you because you had hope,
I married you 'cause you had a cute ass.
Mm.
- Bill, Bill?
- What?
Oh, what's happening?
- It's like a hundred degrees in here.
Oh, man.
Oh.
Oh, damn.
Todd, you.
Aw.
Oh.
- Daddy.
- Oh!
- Please, Daddy, help!
Daddy, help!
Please, help me.
Please, Daddy, help.
- Jessica?
- Daddy, I'm cold.
- Jessie?
- Bill?
I thought you were fixing the air conditioner?
- Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I have to,
I have to fix, ah.
I gotta fix a broken circuit breaker switch.
- That's okay, that's okay.
We'll open some windows.
We'll slow roast over night.
- Okay.
- It's on.
- Yeah, this house has a mind of its own.
- How's the weather in New York?
Yeah, Mom, it's gonna be a great party.
- Is that Mom?
- Hey, Mom, Todd's here, do you wanna talk to him?
Okay, I'll tell him, bye.
- What'd you hang up for, spaz?
She had to go.
Sorry.
- Hey, Todd?
- What?
- Got a pinata outside that needs filling.
Whoa, apocalypse.
- Bill!
Bill, you'd never believe what just happened.
- Ah, jeez.
Ah.
I must have left the parking brake off.
- Aw, what are we gonna do?
The party's in an hour.
- I don't know, Claire.
- Where did this thing come from?
- It's an old dollhouse
I found in the shed.
What about this?
- Faster, faster!
- Backwards, terrific.
- One more!
- One more, go, go!
- Okay, okay.
- Go, go!
Forward, forward, forward.
- No, no.
- No, no, no.
Other way, other way.
Uh, to the left.
- Left, left, left.
- She's gettin' close, no.
Other way.
- Right, right, left.
Left, okay, right, left.
- There, there.
- Right, left.
- There!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Max, you're smarter than anyone here.
Except for me, of course.
- Hey, Einstein.
Why don't you put your stupid mouse away and come join the party?
- I've got a better idea.
Why don't you go find yourself an IQ and leave me and my mouse alone?
- All right, man, I tried.
Oh, you must be Jimmy.
Let me get a look at ya.
I'm Tobias, that's Marla.
Hey, we're your new aunt and uncle.
- Oh.
- Welcome to the family.
- Thanks.
- Hey there, little brother.
- Hey, Sis.
Mm, you look great.
- Oh.
Aunt Marla!
- Happy Birthday, mm.
Hey, come over here.
So how's it going Tobias?
You've got wasps.
- Uh, well, I'll look into that.
Ooh, very nice, very nice.
- Right?
Yeah, yeah.
It's a little small.
- Dad, I wanna open yours now.
- Remember honey, it's from all of us.
This is a big one.
- Oh!
- Oh!
- You guys, I love it!
- Hey, runt, why don't you ask her if you can move in?
- That's hysterical, Todd.
You really are quite funny.
- Oh!
- Oh!
- Wow.
- Okay, who wants cake, hmm?
- Yeah.
- Todd, Todd, go cut some cake.
Okay?
- I thought you cleaned it?
- I did.
- Look at this neat box.
- Tobias, that's--
- Not now.
I hope you're not too old for this.
- No way.
Thank you so much.
- Oh, you're so welcome.
- Lucky.
- How did that get in there?
Hmm.
That oughta do it.
Oh, almost.
Very close, whoa, easy kiddo, easy.
Give me that.
Who's next?
- Me, me!
- Jessica, do you wanna give it a try?
- I'll do it.
- I don't feel so good.
Jimmy.
Jim-boy, come on in here and show 'em how it's done, huh?
Give him the blindfold there.
- Okay.
- That's good.
- Hit it, hit it.
- Would you like to play, sweetheart?
- That's good.
- Hit it hard, hit it hard.
- Spin around, yes.
- One, two, three,
- Hit it hard.
- You're not peaking, are ya?
- Four, five.
Good, dizzy?
Good, okay, all right.
- Okay, Jimmy, go ahead.
- Are you ready?
Take a good shot at it.
Nice and straight.
- Go, go, Jimmy.
- Go, go!
- Oh, good one, try again.
Try again, one more.
- Do it again!
- Again, again!
One more time.
- Candy!
- Candy!
It's on me!
- Oh, geez.
- Get it off me!
- I'll get it, I'll get it.
- Get it off!
- Get it, get it!
Oh.
- Ew.
- Jeez, man.
You tried to kill me.
You knew I was afraid of spiders.
- I was trying to help you, man.
Todd, you're in big trouble now.
- Dad, I put a fake spider in there as a joke, but it was rubber, not real.
- This is no joke.
Upstairs to your room, you're grounded for a month.
But Bill,
I don't, really.
- Upstairs, now!
- I can't believe you.
- Aunt Marla, I'm,
I'm really sick.
- Hmm.
Hey, how's she doing?
- She's completely unbalanced.
Tomorrow I'll bring by some special tea.
Oh, relax.
It's just some herbs and medicinal roots.
Maybe a little arsenic thrown in for texture.
- Very funny.
In the meantime,
I have just the thing to reduce your fever.
- I hope it's not too weird.
- No, weird is an understatement.
This is a very powerful, ancient remedy.
They call it children's aspirin.
You take those and try to get some sleep, okay?
- Okay.
- All right.
Bill, don't you think the dollhouse would be better off in a larger room?
- No, I want it to stay in here.
- Whoa, sis, whoa, easy, easy.
- Oh, oh, is it warm in here?
Am I'm having a hot flash.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I, um,
I guess it's been a rough day.
Get some rest now.
- Okay, little brother.
Talk to me.
Something's wrong.
- No, it's just stress.
Uh, okay.
I'm having my dreams again.
- Like when you were a kid?
- Mm-hmm, yeah, yeah.
It's just the stress, though.
You know, it's just, it's the move is a lot tougher than I thought it was gonna be.
- You know, I have the most vivid memory of you when you were little.
Yeah?
- Always building something.
- Oh.
Here we go.
- Remember that castle you built out of tree twigs once?
- Yeah, Fort Birch,
I called it.
- Mm.
You insisted on putting a large flag right through the top of it.
- Mm-hmm.
- And I told you if you did, it would crumble under the weight of it.
- Which is exactly what I did.
I put a large flag right on top of it.
- Mm-hmm.
- Crumbled under the weight.
Just like you said.
- Be careful, Bill.
Your family's more delicate than you think.
When I was in Jessica's room,
I received some strange vibrations off that dollhouse.
And it definitely was not a hot flash.
You felt it at the party too, didn't you?
- Like a nail through my forehead.
I'll look into it.
Todd?
Hey, Todd?
Todd, open the door, will ya?
Todd, open the door, I'm coming in.
- Don't you ever knock?
- I knocked 10 times.
I wanna talk to you about the spider incident.
- Yeah, well I don't.
- Todd, you're digging yourself a deeper hole here.
- Well give me a shovel.
- I want you to go apologize to Jimmy right now.
- No, no way.
I'm not helping you score brownie points with your new son.
Forget it.
- Please stop.
- Don't you walk away from me when I'm talking to you.
Son of a bitch!
- What's going on?
Oh, this, dammit.
- What?
- How did you do that?
Ah, that's one hell of a Santa Ana.
- Dad, you're, you're nose, it's bleeding.
- Oh, man, no kidding.
- Hey, Dad?
I'm sorry.
Jimmy?
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
I just wanted to make sure you're okay.
It wasn't one of my better parties.
- Bill overreacted if you ask me.
Dad never lost it like that.
He was always in control.
- You'd be surprised.
- What do you mean?
- Nevermind.
Listen, it's getting late.
Why don't you get some rest, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay, good night, sweetie.
- Good night, Mom.
Max?
- Max, what are you doing here?
You like the dollhouse too.
That's my room.
Help, help!
What's wrong, Jess?
- It's under my bed.
- Hey, what's going on?
What's going on here?
Huh, huh?
- I don't know, Dad, there's something under that bed, it's like a giant raccoon or something.
- No, Dad, it was Max.
- He's dead!
Oh, shit.
- Dude, I'm sorry, man.
- No you're not!
You've hated me ever since I got here.
You killed him!
- But it was an accident.
- You're just lying to defend him.
- Jimmy, Jessica doesn't lie.
- Yeah, right, Bill.
- Jimmy.
- Honey, let me talk to him.
- Dad, it was an accident, I swear.
- I know.
- Watch out, Todd.
- So much for the giant rat.
- But it was there.
You saw it.
- I don't know, Jess.
- Todd?
I'm scared.
- Hey, Jimmy.
Hey, Jim.
Todd didn't mean to hurt Max.
- He didn't hurt him, he killed him.
There's a notable difference.
- Look, I'm not trying to take
Todd's side in this thing.
- I'm just trying--
- Yes, you are.
You're defending that Neanderthal.
I hate it here so much.
- Well then why don't you tell me what you'd like me to do to make it better for you, okay?
- I want you to leave me alone.
That's what I want.
- All right.
I'm sorry about Max.
- Whatever.
Dad, Dad!
But, but, Dad, you, you're dead.
- Shh.
Not so loud, Jim.
- You can't be real.
- I'm here, aren't I?
- Feels like a dream.
- A dream that's come true.
- I've missed you so much.
- How have you been?
- I've been bad.
I mean, I hate my life.
I hate this house.
I hate everybody here.
Except for Mom, of course.
- Don't you like Bill?
- Huh, are you kidding?
He's the biggest loser of them all.
- Maybe that's because he doesn't care about you, Jim.
The truth is, he wants to take your mom away from you.
- Yeah, that's just what I've been thinking.
But who cares, Dad, now that you're here.
Wait until Mom sees.
- No, no, no, no.
Don't say anything just yet.
This will be our little secret.
We have plans to make.
Plans about what to do with Bill.
Maybe what happened to
Max should happen to Bill.
- But Dad, wait, I.
Unbelievable.
- This is a nightmare, Claire.
- Hey, I figure 10, 12 years, the kids are outta here.
- Mm.
- Hmm?
- How do you do it, huh?
- Mm.
I think about how hard you're trying to make this work for all of us.
- I love you.
- Mm.
Oh, yeah, you feel so good.
Am I doing this right?
- I don't know.
- Hey, Claire.
Look, um, about Jimmy's mouse.
I didn't mean to hurt him.
- I'm not mad at you Todd.
Can't you wait until I'm finished?
- What's your problem?
- Nothing.
Just go back to bed.
- This family is so fucked up.
Not funny, Dana.
It was so funny.
- My parents are asleep upstairs.
- So what?
- So how'd you get in here?
- I found the key.
- Aw, you.
Come on, let's go.
- Okay, let's go outside.
God, it reeks.
- Mm.
- Oh, take it easy there.
- Wow, this is cool.
Hey, look at this.
Eh, I love bugs.
Well that's a whole lotta bug to love.
- Yeah.
Hey, that's your fireplace.
Did your dad build a house on this burned down lot?
- Yeah, he did.
Saved us a ton of money using the original fireplace.
But it's not that interesting.
- No.
- I never liked that shirt anyway.
- What was that?
How am I supposed to know?
- Are you sure that thing was dead?
- As dead as this town on a Saturday night.
Get out!
- Todd, come on!
- Just go!
Todd!
- It's in his ear!
- Hold his head.
I'll douse it.
It wasn't dead.
That thing wasn't dead.
- Okay.
- Is it okay?
Good, good.
Easy.
Todd?
The guy in the emergency room said he's never seen one like it.
Todd's asleep.
- You know he spends too much time with Dana.
She's trouble.
She's not good for him.
He can do a whole lot better.
They're gonna burn.
- Don't, don't.
What's happening to me?
Okay, guys.
I have pancakes.
- I'm going to my room.
I don't feel so good.
- I'm not hungry.
- I'm gonna do the dishes.
- I'm going outside.
I need some fresh air.
- Good morning, Jimmy.
Morning.
Huh, what's up with boy genius?
- Hmm, don't ask.
- I brought Jess over some of that tea I talked about.
- Yeah, well, you might as well take it upstairs.
She's not feeling any better today.
- Hmm.
This whole family needs their chakras realigned.
Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah.
- Did you cut yourself?
Uh-uh.
Listen, I'm gonna go do some shopping.
- Can I come along?
Marla can watch the kids.
- No, that's okay.
I need to be alone.
- Great.
- What's the matter baby?
You're troubled, aren't you?
- I'm just a little scared.
That's all.
- Is it the dollhouse?
- How did you know?
- Just called it a hunch.
- I think it's magical.
Its windows open by themselves, and it turned Jimmy's baby mouse into a huge monster mouse.
You believe me, don't you?
- Oh, honey, I more than believe you.
Look, I tell you what, why don't we just get this thing out of your room, huh?
- See, I told you.
What are we gonna do now?
- Jess, I want you to make a list of all the strange things it does.
You think you can do that for me, sweetheart?
- Yeah.
Write down everything unusual.
Just like a real detective.
- Yeah.
I'll be back later, okay?
Okay.
- What could be in here?
Ow.
Rule number one, don't touch the attic door.
Did you bring me what I need?
- I took it from the dollhouse.
- All right, I'll see what I can see.
- Looking good.
- Oh, hey Claire.
- Hey.
- Ah, listen, let's bury the hatchet.
Come on, play some one on one with me.
- I don't think so.
- Come on,
Dad says you're good.
- Ah, dammit, let me go.
- You know, Claire, I thought you were gonna be cool.
I was wrong.
- What's happening to me?
- Claire?
Claire?
Claire?
I finally fixed the gas line.
Unbelievable how high the pressure was.
So how are you doin'?
What, what?
Oh, oh, Claire.
I've never seen you like this.
Claire, are you okay?
What's, what's wrong?
- I guess I'm just not used to a house full of kids.
- Then we need to be alone, huh?
Todd, you got the number for restaurant, right?
- Yeah, yeah, don't worry about it.
- Good, listen, I've been doing some thinking, and I think you and Dana should call it quits for a while.
- Hey, look, Dad, um--
- No, you should stop seeing Dana until you learn to be a little bit more responsible.
- I totally understand.
- You do?
- Yeah, oh, she's history anyways.
Too much trouble.
If you know what I mean.
- Yeah, good, good.
- Ready.
- Hey, you look great.
- Thanks.
- Thanks for watching the kids.
- Yeah, no problem.
- Bye, Todd.
- Good night, Claire.
Have a nice dinner.
All right, midgets.
Game over, go to bed.
What, did I stutter?
Let's go, come on, go to bed.
Oh.
- Upstairs, come on.
Bedtime for you guys.
It's getting late.
Come on.
- It's only eight o'clock.
- I don't wanna go to my room.
You can't make me.
Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, I don't like my room anymore.
- That's too bad
'cause you're going.
And I can make you.
And if I catch either of you two down here, you're dead meat.
- Well, I guess I'll see you tomorrow then.
- Good night, Jimmy.
- Fascinating.
Dad.
- I'm digging the hole for us, Jim.
For us.
- You're starting to really scare me Dad.
- Don't you see what's going on here?
Your mom has forgotten all about me.
Bill will get you to do the same.
You'll forget I ever existed.
- No, I won't.
I'll never forget.
- Bill has to be removed.
- I won't do it.
- Get with the program, boy.
You must not miss me.
- But I do.
I miss you.
- Then kill him, Jim.
Kill him for me.
You can't make me do it.
- Do it for me, Jimmy.
You'll feel a whole lot better if you do.
You'll feel a whole lot better if you do.
- What's going on with us, Claire?
- I don't know, it's like we're falling apart before we've even begun.
Oh, man.
I have a feeling I'm totally out of control here.
And my motto is if it's broken, I'll fix it.
- I remember this.
Us laughing.
Enjoying each other.
I actually feel kinda normal right now.
- Honey, what I'm gonna tell you right now is gonna sound a little crazy.
- Nothing's gonna sound crazy to me at this point.
- Well, I had this bad dream.
- That's it?
- That's a lot.
I haven't had a dream like this since I was 10 years old.
Do you remember how I told you that my mom and dad died?
- In the house fire.
- Yeah, yeah.
Well, I had this dream that the house was burning and I told my parents about it, and I told 'em that we should get out and they didn't believe me.
And the next day, the house went up like a match when I was at school.
Marla says I have these gifts, you know.
Whatever they are, they're driving me out of my mind.
- What's it telling you now?
- It's telling me that, that I'm gonna lose you.
- Oh.
- That I'm gonna lose all of you.
- Oh, oh, Bill.
- Ah, what took you so long?
I've been waiting out there forever.
- Hey, dweeb removal takes time.
- So, how long do we have?
- Long enough.
- Cool.
- I'm not afraid of you.
Go ahead, do something.
I dare you.
Rule number two, it listens.
- Gosh, it's good to see you laugh.
I thought I was boring you to death.
- No, I was just thinking.
For some reason, I feel right at home in this house.
- This house gives me the creeps.
You know, as a matter of fact,
I've thinking about taking off.
As in permanently.
- You just don't know how good you've got it, do you?
Okay, look at my life.
I don't have a father, and my loving mother kicks me out of the house every time one of her boyfriends comes over.
I would die to have a family like yours.
You just don't get it.
Here isn't so bad, Todd.
I'm here.
- You're the only reason I'm still around.
- Hey.
- Hmm?
- Why don't you go get us a drink.
- All right.
- Hey, Todd?
How do you turn this thing on?
- Oh, the switch is on the wall.
♪ Here I go
Hey, how strong do you want these?
The stronger the better.
Right.
Right.
Ooh.
I'm not afraid.
Go ahead, do something.
I dare you.
I'll be right there.
Oh, yeah, party time.
Oh.
- Todd, are you okay?
- Kids, go upstairs and stay there.
Jimmy, call 911!
Go, Jess.
- It hurts.
- I'm gonna go with her.
- No, I'm going with her.
- No, no, Todd you stay here.
I'm gonna go with her.
- No, I'm going with her.
- Todd, you stay here.
- You stay here.
You stay here, Todd.
- You know, this is all your fault.
- Todd.
- This is all your fault!
You and your goddamn gas lines.
- Todd, Todd!
- I wish you never built this fucking house.
- Todd, Todd.
- Let him go.
Let him go.
- All right.
- Get him strapped in.
Let's go.
- All right, let's go.
Move it out.
- You did this.
Give me that.
Whoa.
My hand disappears in the fireplace.
- Who is it?
- Hey.
- Hi, Mom.
Todd told me you called 911.
- Oh, it was no big deal.
- Oh, it's pretty brave of you.
- Mom, I.
I'm tired.
- Okay, honey.
It's late.
Get some sleep.
I hope
Dana's gonna be okay.
Yeah, me too.
It's pretty horrible, huh?
- I can think of worse.
Please don't come out.
Please.
- Ready?
- As ready as I'll ever be.
Open to me the secret way.
Oh.
It can't escape the pentagram.
- I'm not sure it needs to.
Marla?
- Go to them, Tobias.
Go.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- So how's Dana doing?
- She's in a coma.
I'll tell Todd in the morning.
I'll get ready for bed.
No, no, please, please!
- Mm.
Mm.
- No!
No!
No, please!
We have to get outta here.
- I'm doing this for us, Jim.
It's payback time.
- Dad, no!
Dad!
Bill!
- Oh, honey, did you have a bad dream?
- I'll go.
- Is that how I raised you?
To be a little girl?
Jimmy?
- That your new best friend, Jim?
- No, Dad.
- Well it sure sounds like it to me.
Jimmy.
Hey, Jim, open up, let's talk, buddy.
Come on, buddy.
Let's talk, all right?
Jim.
Jimmy.
Jimmy, out!
- Hey, Mr. Brady.
Let's have a little pow wow.
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
- Hey, I thought
Bill came to see.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, he hit you, that bastard.
- Mom, Dad hit me.
- You mean Bill hit you.
- No, it was Dad.
Dad hit me.
- Don't you defend him.
- They're coming for you Bill.
And they are gonna eat your soul.
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, Claire--
- How dare you hit him?
- What, I didn't hit him.
- How dare!
- I want you out.
- I didn't, Claire!
I didn't, dammit!
- Get out, get out!
- Claire, I didn't do it!
- I said, get out!
- Come on, dammit, I--
- You asshole!
- I had a dream, dammit!
- Fuck your dreams!
- Claire!
- Just get out!
Dad, no.
- Claire, Claire, Claire!
Come on!
- Glad to see I still excite you Claire.
- Mom.
- Please leave me alone.
Please, leave me alone.
Please, leave me alone.
Oh.
No!
- Jess?
And when she got home, she built a very big, big fire in the fireplace.
All right, Jim.
We're getting to the best part.
This is where the evil witch throws Hansel into the fire.
- Stop it.
- Oh, Claire,
I thought you used to love our quiet little evenings by the fire.
- Don't do this!
- But Claire, we're going to the other side.
Don't worry, it only hurts forever.
- Dana?
What are you doing here?
I thought you were in the hospital.
I had to get out of there, Todd.
There was so many sick people.
- But I saw you, you, you were hurt.
Shh, let's just pick up where we left off.
- He got the wife.
My family.
They're gonna burn, just like--
- No, no, that's not gonna happen.
I'll take that.
We don't have much time.
- All right.
Let's find Jessica.
- Let's try that again.
- Let go!
Hey!
Let him go.
- Wait your turn, Bill.
Not so fast, big boy.
- Oh, let me go!
- Are you okay?
- The doll, get the doll.
- Maggot brain.
You're history.
- You can't do this, Jim.
I'm your father.
- No you're not.
My father's dead.
- So beautiful.
I love you so much.
- Thanks, Bill.
- I'm proud of you buddy.
Go, go.
- The dollhouse.
We have to get it.
- Jessica's room.
- I'll get Todd.
- Okay, let's go.
- They're coming for you.
- Come on.
Come on, we gotta get outta here.
Come on, come on, Todd.
I knew she wasn't good enough for you.
- Ready?
Where is she?
Jessica?
Tobias, she made notes on the dollhouse.
Downstairs, she's in the fireplace!
She's not upstairs.
It's okay, we're gonna find her.
You two, get out of the house, now.
- No, I'm staying.
- No.
- Claire, we gotta get out of this house.
That's what I'm saying.
Come on, Claire.
Let's go!
- This was in my dream.
- Daddy.
Please help me.
- She's in there.
This is a portal.
- If it's a portal, it's the welcome mat to hell.
- No, I saw this in my dreams!
Help me.
Please, please, help me.
Please Daddy, help me.
Daddy, I'm over here, help.
Help me, Daddy.
- Jessie.
- Daddy, I'm here.
Oh, honey.
- I think I like it better where they went.
Ah, Tobias.
- Damn, that was hot.
- Daddy, where are we?
- I don't know, honey, I don't know.
I've seen this place in my dreams.
- I've seen it too.
This is a place of evil.
- Tobias, what is this?
- Husks.
It's bad.
- I saw them being born.
- Ah, yeah.
- What are these things?
- You don't wanna know.
Demons, a small one, the size of a rat just about killed Marla and me.
- These, there are--
- Much bigger, Daddy.
- We need to get outta here.
- There's four.
I saw it in the dollhouse.
- It's locked.
- Wait.
They won't cross into the light.
Look that way, Daddy.
It opens the other way in my dollhouse.
Go, you must burn the dollhouse.
- Tobias, Tobias, I'm not leaving you here.
- Bill, you have to save your family.
You bastards!
That way, run, go, go!
Go on, Jessie, go.
Get outta here!
Jessica, go outside, now!
Go honey.
Run to Mommy!
- Let's go, Bill.
Where is he?
- Come on, Bill.
Let's go, Bill.
Oh, Bill!
Oh!
- Daddy, are you okay?
- Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
Let's get outta here.
- Is it over?
- Yes, honey, it's over.
- Inside, honey, inside.
You and your damn farmhouse.
- That's okay, as long as we're together.
We can build another house.
- Hey, next time, let's just rent.
You know,
Todd, I've been thinking.
That house was definitely not up to code.
You're father's a great guy, but the fact that he got a contractor's license is scary.
You're sure right, little brother.
Once, in a time before time,
God breathed life into the universe.
And the light gave birth to Angels.
And the earth gave birth to man.
And fire gave birth to the Djinn. Creatures condemned to dwell in the void between the worlds.
One who wakes a Djinn shall be given three wishes.
Upon the granting of the third, the unholy legions of the Djinn shall be freed upon the earth.
Fear one thing only in all that is...
Fear the Djinn.
Make your second wish.
Astonish Me, Djinn.
Show me wonders.
As you wish.
Help me, sorcerer.
Help me!
Free us wizard.
Remove this curse.
Help us.
Behold. By all the names of God,
This is not what I wanted!
Then wish it away exalted one.
Wish it away.
Stop!
No more wishes.
I beg your majesty. Silence.
But my poor people.
I must...
Do you wish their fate on the entire world?
No more wishes. Please.
I warned you, wizard.
Hold your tongue.
I'm the wish, is all this creature needs.
Three wishes granted to the one who woke him lets him open the gateway between worlds.
New wonders, majesty.
New splendors.
And new and terrible masters.
Yes...
I'm surprised you're here in person Mr. Beaumont.
Paperwork is completely in order.
I waited it ten years, for this piece.
Antiquarian sculpture.
Eight foot tall.
A statue of the pre-Islamic God,
Ahura Mazda.
Under Islam, these gods were outlawed.
It's a miracle this was ever made.
Jesus Christ!
What the hell is he doing?
God dammit!
Does the word DUMB ASS mean anything to you?
Watch that crate!
That's very expensive stuff!
Up yours...
...ahh shit!
Ughhhh. Ten years...
Hi. I can help you?
Maybe. I got a pawnshop down the garment district,
5th and Tooley. The armpit of the universe.
Anyway, this came in this morning.
I had a hunch about it. Gave the guy a good price, and I'd like you to appraise it.
Well, I think you made a smart move.
- Nick?
- Shannon?
I think we have something
Alex should take a look at.
Hello Betty!
Wow. This is ah... uh, this...
Which is its providence?
What?
History. Where did it come from?
Oh! I bought it from a guy he said he got it from his grandmother.
That's all I know.
I've heard that one before.
I tell you what. I want to have my best appraiser take a look at this.
Shannon here is going to fill out a receipt for you.
And thank you for, uh... choosing Regal Auctioneering.
Sure.
I guess that's it.
I guess it is.
Nice game.
How is um... Rick ?
I don't know. I haven't spoken to him.
It's over.
What's it been now? Six and a half weeks?
Seven.
Are you counting?
I thought. Maybe we, uh...
- What?
I thought maybe we could go out.
We go out all the time.
Yes, we go out all the time, but we don't "Go Out".
There's a difference.
You are my best friend.
Do you know hard a friend is to find?
I dont wanna...
I do not want to mess that up.
Dates are a dime a dozen.
Aw come on now. It's so old.
It's a date.
Wait. You know what it is?
I'm just...
I'm just worried about losing what little I've got left now.
Including you.
How about dinner and a movie?
How about hotdogs and a ball game?
Playing it safe, huh?
I am going out on a limb here.
I'm casting a spell on you here Alex.
Maybe it'll work.
Hey.
I'll see you later.
I'll be at the lab.
Hey Alex.
Think about what I said.
My god. A fire opal this size.
It's magnificent.
How magnificent?
Excellent translucence.
No other color traces.
It's unique.
Oh that's a good word.
Oh I love that word.
"Unique"
Should that show quite a price? Yeah?
Oh yes.
- I am salivating. Get me a report ASAP?
- Yes.
- Nick?
- Hmm?
Leave.
- Oh, ummm.
- Yes!
What's this?
You woke me.
You woke me.
What?
I didn't hear you come in, you scared me. I...
What's the verdict?
I think...  ...there may be something wrong with it.
Does it affect the value?
I have to talk to a friend of mine.
We're gonna have to run some more tests.
Tests?
Like what? A physical?
- There'something inside of it?
- Right.
I don't know. I'm no gemmologist.
I could run some spectral analysis, infrared. Get some readings.
That'd be great. Can you do it now?
Oh hoh no. Hold on.
I got about two hours worth of
Professor Leiber's bullshit to take of first.
I'll get to it as soon as I can.
Come on. Do you want to stay?
No, I can't. I have got to put my girls through their basis.
Thanks. This is really important.
So call me later. Okay?
You're the best Josh.
I owe ya.
Yeah. Well, how about that dinner then?
Time-out.
You.
That was very good.
Very good. Do you know why you missed?
Huh-uh.
You didn't have stillness.
All of you can put the ball in the hoops as long as you take your time. take a breath.
Get your aim. Right?
But you don't always have that time in a game.
Somebody is always going to be trying to take the ball away from you, and that's when you need stillness.
Not in your body. Your mind.
When you get a chance to make a shot, you've got to forget about everything else.
Time doesn't exist.
The other players do not exist.
It is you and the basket.
You see it, you find it.
Shoot the ball.
Laser targeting for analysis
Wow. This is the easiest date you have ever gotten Aickman.
What is that?
You awoke me.
End laser scanning.
End the laser scan Dammit!
"Hi. Geophysics. We're probably changing lead into gold right now."
So, leave a message.
Josh, it is Alex, you are there?
- Josh, something
- Alex really weird happened to me on the court, and I really need to talk about it.
Is somebody there?
- Yes.
- Oh my god.
- Is the pain terrible?
- Oh god.
I can help you with that.
I can ease your suffering.
All you have to do is ask.
Tell me you want the pain to cease
Yes.
As you wish.
Oh my god...
Josh!
Computer malfunction. It must have been one hell of a computer.
- Josh.
- Hey!
- Josh. JOSH!
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey miss.
- Hey lady. Lady. Hey hey.
- Josh! Josh!
Is he? Is he?
Get off of me!
I'm sorry.
I'm detective Nathan.
And you are?
Alex Amberson.
Alex Amberson.
Alright? Good.
I take it that you knew the... um, Josh.
He was my best friend.
I'm sorry.
Look, uh.
You want to have a seat?
No. I want to know what happened.
It looks like an accident.
An equipment malfaunction maybe.
You have any idea what he was working on?
He was analysing...
...a gem stone.
Opal.
For me.
Excuse me lady. Uh.
Help out an old altar boy?
If you ain't got no change, a dollar will do it.
Hell, I'll even take five.
I'll wait until you get back.
Look. How many times do I gotta tell you?
Hey, you left customers in there.
That's not a good way to run a business.
Don't tell me how to run my business.
You're a fucking bum.
Well you don't tell me how to run my life.
You're a fucking prick.
I'll talk to anybody I want to.
You don't own this fucking sidewalk.
You wanna know something?
I do own this fucking sidewalk.
You wanna know why?
Because I pay fucking taxes.
Fuck you.
No. Fuck you.
I hope you die, you sack of shit.
I hope you die, and I hope you float down the gutter so I can fuck'n piss on ya.
Bald headed baboon.
Piss complected afterbirth to a Chinese gang banger.
Educated idiot!
"I own the sidewalk."
"I pay taxes"
I got your taxes swinging.
I tell you what to do with your taxes.
And I hope they poke a hole into your kidneys when they are heading up towards your throat.
I hope you rot in hell.
And that goes for your...
Who is that?
A friend, perhaps.
Tell me...
Do you really mean those curses you hurled so freely?
Damned right I did.
What would you do to have them come true?
A cigarette and a handshake is about all I got right now pal.
Not quite.
You have a soul.
That, I'd trade for a shower and a jug of Jack.
Then the death of your enemy would consider a bargain.
You really are fucked up.
You know that?
But I do like the way you think.
Indulge me then.
What would you have happen?
Give it some thought.
Enjoy it.
He should only get cancer.
Should only get cancer and die.
As you wish.
Welfare checks. Food stamps.
And another thing I...
Hey buddy, you Okay?
- You okay?
- I do not know.
Let her. Let her...
Let her go.
Was it worth it?
Run, insect.
Run and tell those you will, what you will.
Tell them there is something loose in their city.
Something which feeds on wishes, but tell them quickly. while you still have a soul.
Hey.
You're not enjoying it.
Put it out.
I am really sorry about Josh.
I know how close you guys were.
No, we were'nt as close as he wanted, and now it's just to...
Alex. Listen to me.
What happened to Josh is not your fault.
I think it is.
What?
There was something...
...weird, in the opal.
I think that was what exploded.
I think what I gave Josh is what killed him.
Do you have any idea how crazy that sounds?
Yes. I know exactly how crazy it sounds.
That's the problem.
Do you, um...
Do you want me to call Dr. Montiglio again?
No.
I'm fine.
I'm just upset.
You're not just upset.
You're imagining things, just like the last time.
This is nothing like the last time Shannon.
Why don't you go to bed?
I don't want you to worry.
Can you can the "Big Sister Act" for just one night?
The fire was years ago.
You got me out. Okay?
I got you out.
I didn't get mom out.
I didn't get dad out.
Not "Didn't".
"Couldn't".
Could not. Not your fault.
Just like Josh, it's not your fault Alex.
You really gotta stop blaming yourself, or the whole fucking thing is gonna to start again.
The therapy, the nightmares, everything.
No, it isn't.
It's nothing like last time.
But something's going on.
Something bad.
I'm gonna find out what it is.
Ready to play, Alex?
I can smell your fear.
I'm looking for a dock worker named Etchison.
- That's him over there.
- Is that him?
Mr. Etchison?
Sweetheart, you can call me anything you like.
Please. I don't have time for your games.
Well that's a damn shame.
'could be fun.
Oaky. Let's talk about the opal.
The jewel?
I don't know what you're talk'n about.
That's odd. Your friend Clegg knew exactly wat I was talking about.
I don't know him either.
I think you do.
Middle aged guy, runs a pawn shop.
Ratted you out at the first snip of a lawsuit.
Alright. What's the deal?
Are you a cop?
No. And we don't ever have to involve them if you tell me where you got it.
Out of that statue. After the accident.
You must have seen it on the news.
It killed a guy.
The Beaumont piece?
How the hell should I know?
There was some guy who had bought it. Yeah.
Hey. Like, give me a couple hndred.
Did I get fucked?
Royally.
Alexandra.
How nice to see you again.
Mr. Beaumont, I am so sorry about what happened.
Yes. Irreplaceable.
One of a kind.
We are talking about Ed Finney, your assistant, right?
Oh yes.
Yes of course.
Well, if you are not too broken up about him,
I'd like to ask you a few questions about the sculpture.
Anything you wish.
Well, the newspapers seem more concerned with the details of the accident than a crane operator and such.
- That drunken swine. and less concerned about the details of the statue itself.
Was it bejeweled?
No.
No, undecorated.
A likeness of Ahura Mazda.
One of the few to have been made after the Islamic conversion.
I tell you what. Here uh...
Let me show you something.
You'll be interested in this,
I think.
Any new treasures at the auction house?
Geez!
Asshole!
Gotcha.
Wow.
My room of t Lost Gods.
Once worshipped, now...
...forgotten.
Every culture of ancient history.
See that?
Down there.
That was the space reserved for Ahura Mazda.
Yes, what exactly is Ahura Mazda?
It's the objects I collect. Alex.
It's not theologies they represent.
But for what it's worth, he was a monotheistic diety
So he was a god of good then.
Certainly.
Interestingly though, legend has it that, uh, the opposing force if you will, is actually his own shadows.
So, in a way, he himself was the source of evil.
There's someone at the University
I'd like to put you onto.
A very smart woman. She has done some catalog descriptions for me in the past.
She could be of some help.
Provided you catch her in a good mood.
Hey. Who's the teacher's pet, huh?
Why the hell are you working in the dark man?
Wait a minute. Who are you?
What the fuck?
Oh my g...
Am I to understand this is not something you wish to see?
Uh huh.
Very well.
My eyes!
My eyes!
Oh my god.
I can't see.
I can't see.
You bastard!
My eyes!
My eyes.
Alex.
Alex!
Alex! Raymond! What's the matter?
Sorry.
I don't know what happened.
You fainted.
Can I get you a drink or something?
Some water?
No.
No. I'm fine.
I guess I'm just under a lot of stress, but I'm fine. Honestly.
Honestly?
I hope you'll be well enough to attend my party.
What it was, to celebrate my acquisition.
Your boss, Mr. Merritt received the invitations.
You and your charming sister should be most welcome.
Well thank you. I'd like to, but I think I may be busy.
...little more...
Little more.
Hold on.
- Ah. Back two feet.
- Okay professor.
Good. Good.
That's good.
I told the Dean's office that the paperwork would be there tomorrow.
I'm Busy.
Okay. Good.
I think you are mistaking me for someone else.
I'm Alex. Raymond Beaumont must have called you, about me?
Oh yeah. What an insufferable prick that man is.
Still, it's not your problem.
Unless, of course, you're stupid enough to be working for him.
No.
Or sleeping with him?
Eh-huh.
No.
Oh good. Well that establishes your discerning good taste.
A little...uh...no, no no no no.
That's not gonna work.
Up stage.
Uh huh? What can I for you?
Absolutely nothing at all, until I can get your full attention.
I like you.
I'm just interfering here anyway.
This is a, uh, co-production.
Folklore department. That's me.
Drama department. That's not me.
As soon as Professor Benson gets here
I'm gonna be run off to him.
The stone of the secret fire was first written by the Empersia, around
Around 900 years ago.
A court sorcerer is said to have imprisoned an evil spirit within it.
An evil spirit?
Yes. A creature from the spaces between the worlds.
A Djinn.
A Djinn?
A genie?
Now hold on a minute. Froget what our culture has made of the Djinn.
Forget Barbars Eden.
Forget Robin Williams.
To the peoples of ancient Arabia, the Djinn was not cute nor funny.
It was something else entirely.
It was the face of fear itself.
How's it look?
You tell me.
Wow.
I'm glad you approve.
Um. You want to try something else?
A different style maybe?
Tighter?
Oh, no. Don't like feeling confined.
I had enough of that.
Okay then, follow me.
With pleasure.
Now, will this be cash or charge Mr....?
Demerest.
Nathaniel Demerest
Call Me Nathaniel.
Okay Nathaniel.
Cash or charge?
Which would you prefer?
I don't know?
Cash?
Done.
Oh.
This is my first day in your world.
Ariella
I am pleased to see beauty as a constant.
Does it bother you... knowing that your beauty will fade?
That your looking glass will day by day tell you a long and unhappy story?
Well. I mean... That's life. Right?
It happens to all of us.
Like it or not.
It doesn't have to, Ariella.
Ask.
Ask and see what happens.
Ask for an end to change.
An end to decay.
Say, "I wish to be beautiful forever."
I wish to be beautiful forever.
Pleasure doing business with you.
Soon I will find you.
...would you like to do this some other time?
No.  I'm a... I'm...
AH!
I just wanted Professor Derleth to check out my costume.
Well obviously it's scary enough.
Go back to rehearsal.
Thanks.
You alright?
Yes.
Okay. The Djinn, the word is both plural and singular by the way, are a race created after the angels, but before mankind.
Powerful. Magical. Evil.
Evil?
I though that genies granted wishes.
That's what the myths say.
They're obliged, but their true motivation is always usurping this world for themselves.
I never heard that.
What I heard was...
A sweetened fable.
Over the centuries, faith became fairytales.
We avoided our terror by taming it into fictions and inventing stories of magical lamps to rock our children to sleep.
And the old stories are darker.
Much darker.
In the old writings, the Djinn is everything that we ever feared.
An utterly inhuman race of beings, that mean us harm.
Older than our oldest history.
More powerful than our worst imagining and driven by an ancient and endless malevolence.
Detective Nathanson.
Yeah?
I was told downstairs you were in charge of the Aickman investigation.
I was.
The case is closed. At least as far as homicide is concerned.
Unless you got something to tell me.
Actually, I was hoping you had something to tell me.
Oh, really? And what would that be?
Nothing much.
An address.
A woman called Alexandra.
What the hell makes you think
I can give you her address?
What's your interest in this case anyway?
Why do you keep looking over there?
You see that guy?
Guilty as sin.
Walked on 7 counts.
Walked each time.
Made of teflon makes me sick.
You know what I would like?
I'd love to know.
Just once I'd like it to be easy.
I would like to nail that prick
Dent to the rights.
Murder One. Everybody's an eyewitness.
Alexandra
Hey! You!
The stone of the secret fire created by a great Persian sorcerer to save his people from the Djinn. is as much a curse as a blessing. because it is a doorway between the worlds.
And like all doors, can be opened from either side.
Adjinn, once freed, can use the stone to bring forth his race to our reality, and overwhelm humanity.
But the Djinn must first charge the stone by gathering the souls of humans who have had a single wish granted...
He must then activate it, by finding the human who woke him into this world, and granting him 3 wishes.
The sole limitation to the Djinn's power is that it may only be used in the service of wishes.
Sorry sir. We're closed.
I am trying to locate an employee.
- No on here. Just the boss.
- Alright, I'll talk to the boss.
Open the doors please.
It's appointments only after business hours. Okay?
You're becoming a bother little man.
Open the doors.
Okay pal. It is time for you to go.
Get out of my way.
I don't think so asshole.
Do you have any idea how frustrating it is to have unlimited power, and only be able to use it when some worm asks you for something?
No. I can't say that I do.
I can't say I give a shit either.
Ask me for something.
Okay.
I want you to leave.
No. No.
I have to get inside.
Well now, you's have to go through me.
And that is something I would love to see.
Who the hell are you?
How'd you get in here?
The guard opened up on me.
I wonder if I could ask your help.
I'm looking for Alexandra Amberson.
Ale.. Sh.. She, she was off today.
I asked you who you were.
Someone she's expecting.
Prehaps you'd be so kind as to give me her home address.
Wait a minute. If she knows you, how come you don't have her address?
I said she's expecting me.
I didn't say she knows me.
Oh. Well in that case, um.
Maybe you better e-mail her, because I can't give you her address.
You understand.
Perfectly.
Would you happen to know where she is right now?
Yes. I would.
- would you tell me?
- No. I wouldn't.
Hey, hey!
That's a very valuable piece.
Really?
You would like it to be 100 times its valuable?
Would I like it to be 100 times more valuable?
Yes.
Holy shit.
What are you,
David Copperfield or something?
How'd you do that?
Old family secret.
Where is Alexandra?
Ahhh. Well, I'm sorry, but I don't really feel, um, comfortable telling you.
What would make you comfortable Nick?
Name it.
What's my limit?
Your imagination.
Well, I am not a greedy man...
How about a million dollars?
Done.
Let's just see.
Oh. Wait a minute. You forgotten to fill in the beneficiary.
Oh silly. It's my son Nick.
He owns a very prestigious auction house.
There you go. Thanks for your business
Mrs. Merritt. Enjoy your flight.
Hey. Yourself.
What the hell are you doing?
Learning the rules of the game.
I leave work early to get you back the car, and you're not even ready.
Um Hm.
Basketball?
Damn.
I lost track of time.
Okay. Just uh.
Just give me a second. Okay?
Okay. That was great.
Come on everybody. Let's take a five.
Stillness Miss Amberson.
That's how I did it.
Stillness. Just like you said.
Yes. Go
Go.
Can I have your phone again?
God. Who is this woman anyway?
Damn, it's a machine.
Professor Derleth, this is Alex.
Again.
I really need to talk to you as soon as possible. Please call me back.
Thank you.
Excuse me miss.
Do you mind terribly if I borrow your phone?
I'd be happy to pay for the call.
That's Okay.
Alright. That ought to keep you from tripping. Go.
Nobody home.
Useful little items, arent they?
I claim that, which is old.
- Hello.
- Miss Amberson
It's detective Nathanson.
We need to talk.
There was a guy here looking for you.
I think...
Only you can end their pain Alexandra.
Only you can free them.
Patience, friends.
Patience.
Hi, Uh... Can I come in?
The stone is charged. It's charged with people's souls, fed with their fear.
And the Djinn is after me.
I need to know what the hell to do.
Alexandra, this is the 20th century.
Don't you think all that sounds a little unlikely?
Would you like something to drink, by the way?
No.
Thank you.
Well, I would.
This is a nice cabinet, isn't it?
Your boss would really like this.
My boss? I never told you who I work for.
You didn't?
Then how would I know?
Maybe Beaumont mentioned it?
Oh, yeah!
He did.
Let me explain.
You are obviously looking for some piece of magic. Some spell to get rid of this hypothetical Djinn that you're talking about. right?
Yes.
They certainly existed.
- You are cold?
- No, I'm fine.
Would you like me to put the heat on?
No. Just please continue.
Alright...
Where was I?
Oh yeah! Spells, sorcerers.
Alexandra.
You were born into an age of reason and an age of science.
All the sorcerers are dead and all the spells lost, to time.
But the Djinn itself.
The Djinn, if it existed.
Would be all there was.
Imagine that.
The only magical thing in a rationalist world.
A vulnerable world of disbelief.
Where no reason would ever rescue you.
Nor Science save you.
He would have a fine old time.
Wouldn't he?
This is no joke.
No, it's not funny.
Are you hungry?
I'm not hungry. I'm not thirsty.
I'm not...
Why do you keep trying to do things for m...?
I'm sorry.
I guess I'm just a little tense.
I guess.
But I'm fine.
Alright.
Where were we?
Oh, yes.
No spells.
No hope.
If there's no hope. No magic.
I'll have to rely on myself.
Match wits with a creature older than time.
Match wits with a prince of the Dark Dominions.
Pit your tiny 20th century brain against one that walked the spaces between the worlds, and trod the wings of angels beneath his concrete feet.
Oh Alexandra, you're a delight.
Really. You are.
I'm glad I can amuse you.
Oh. I hurt your feelings.
I'm sorry.
Let me make it up to you.
What can I do?
I must be going now.
Sit down!
Please.
Sit down.
Where's Wendy?
Bedroom.
But I wouldn't go in there if I were you.
Messy.
I needed her face.
You killed her?
Actually, I can't kill anyone.
Not unless they wish me to.
Your research should have told you that.
She didn't wish to be dead
You lying sack of shit!
I showed her my true face.
Her reaction wasn't very flattering.
As a matter of fact, she got down right hysterical.
I merely asked her if she if she wished to be released from her fear.
You're a dangerous person to know,
Alexandra.
Your scientist friend. Your boss.
The policemen. Wendy.
By the bye.
Where is that tasty little sister of yours today?
If you harm Shannon
I kill to you.
Spare me child.
Behold my true face.
Oh my god.
Yes.
The shit just hit the fan. Didn't it?
Let's get this over with, shall we?
Make your wishes.
Three wishes Alexandra.
Doesn't that intrigue you?
Just a little?
Anything you want.
- Anything?
- You ask for anything
I must grant it.
A trip to the moon.
A visit to Cairo Egypt.
What happens if I wished you dead?
Why, how remarkably original
Alexandra.
I'll tell you what.
I'll give you one free wish.
A sample. Get you into the spirit of the game.
Alright. I want you to destroy yourself.
Blow your brains out.
RIGHT NOW!
Very well.
That which is eternal cannot die.
But if it's any consolation sweet Alex, that hurt like hell.
Now.
Make your three wishes.
I always tell my girls to know their opponent.
So...
I think I will, make a wish.
Good.
I wish... to know what you are.
What are doing?
Granting your wish.
You wish to know what I am.
To you, I am this.
The cry of the abandoned child.
The winter of the whipped beast
I am the face that stares back at you from the shadow do you mirrror?
The hollowness, at the heart of all your hopes, Alexandra.
I am despair.
Shit.
'careful what you wish for.
So. How do you like me so far?
I didn't wish for this.
You're supposed to be outside.
You're not supposed to be here.
I am bound by that which I bind.
Contained and by that which I contain.
This isn't what I wanted.
Well then. Word your wishes more carefully.
Oh Alexandra. You left your sister all alone.
Not to worry. I'll find her and keep her company.
Don't you go near her.
I mighr have to.
You know how persuasive the pain of loved ones can be.
No.
Stop me then.
Wish yourself back.
I wish I was in my apartment.
Right now. Without you.
Shannon?
Shannon, where are you?
We got to get out of here.
Alex. Waited as long as I could.
Gone to Beaumont's party.
Join us if you can!
Shannon.
Two wishes in. We're so connected now.
Wherever you go, there I'll be.
Wherever you are, I will find you.
FUCK YOU!
Going my way?
Excuse me ma'am. Ah..
Is your name on the list?
You have got to help me.
This guy is crazy. He's dangerous.
He broke my window.
He is trying to kill me.
Excuse me sir.
Is Mr. Beaumont expecting you?
I asked you a question.
Sir.
Am I expected? Yes.
I wouldn't be here, if it weren't for Mr. Beaumont.
Well that sounds good.
But it doesn't sound like an invitation.
I don't care what it sounds like.
Step aside.
Let me make this real simple for you.
If your name isn't on the list, you don't get in.
I've dealt with your type before.
Mister, you've never even met my type before.
I am going through that door, and you will not to stop me.
Is that perfectly clear, doorman?
Doorman? The name is Valentine.
Johnny Valentine.
You remember that when they ask how you lost your eye.
Forgive my brassness.
My eagerness for the end game has skewed my judgement. I'll make you a deal.
I don't make deals.
What else do you have to do?
Tonight.
Keep assholes out of parties.
And what about tomorrow?
Surely you are not telling me this is all you can do.
Nor all you ever have done.
It certainly isn't all you ever wished for.
Tell me the truth. Don't you grow weary of this job, day in and day out?
Wouldn't you like to escape to a more exciting profession?
What the FUCK does that have to do with you?
Everything.
Take the chance Johnny.
Answer the question.
Would you like to escape?
Yeah.
As you wish.
Houdini did it in two and a half minutes.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Shannon?
Sorry.
Alex, I didn't know you were com...
What are you doing?
I'm trying to get you outta here.
Come on. We gotta go.
Get the hell off of me.
Shannon. We have got to leave now.
Trust me.
No. Trust me. you obviously haven't seen Beaumont's new friend.
You remember the guy from the basketball court?
Shannon.
Shannon!
...and I was at Cindy's party, of course, the one where they served the divorce papers in the middle of dinner.
It was hysterical.
People talked about it for a year.
Really?
I remember a certain potentate date, whose last party was talked about for centuries.
What do you mean, it went down in history?
Yes.
God, how I'd love to host a party like that.
Shannon!
As you wish.
Ted, you can see right through me.
My God.
Not yet, human.
Soon. Very soon I will be...
Shannon?
Shannon!
Perimeter! Everybody get to the house now!
Shannon!
We have unfinished business.
It's going to stay unfinished.
Listen to their screams child.
Listen to their music of their agony.
You Bastard!
You can save them, Alexandra.
Just wish it away.
No. I won't.
I can't.
My patience wears thin.
What are you gonna do? Kill me?
Where's your third wish then?
I don't need you dead Alexandra.
I just need you to wish you were a...
Run...
...Run
- Raymond.
- Alex. Alex, what is going on here?
Shannon.
Raymond. Have you seen Shannon?
Raymond. Raymond?
Gosh, Raymond?
Hey miss. Come with us.
We're trying to get this under control.
Get out of here.
Get OUT!
He's coming!
Please. We have got to go!
We have got to... it's not going to do any good!
Shannon!
No more doors.
No more rooms.
No more excuses.
Make your wish.
I will not wish.
Really?
Not even when I show you the latest addition to Beaumont's collection.
The final flowering of his wish.
What?
A little masterpiece of my own.
I call it "SISTER".
"WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?"
Oh god.
Shannon!
Rather a good likeness, don't you think?
I especially relish... the 'trapped-animal' look in the eyes.
You vicious son of a BITCH!
You don't approve?
Alright then.
FUCK IT!
You know what I say?
If you can't beat them, burn them baby.
Oh no.
Shannon!
Remind you of something?
Make your wish.
I suggest you do it quickly, dear.
Oh god.
Stillness...
I wish...
Yes?
I wish...
Wish on, child.
Stillness...
I wish Mickey Torelli hadn't been drinking on the job, 2 days ago.
No.
No.
No.
Impossible.
Not by... you!
You should never met me.
I'm surprised you are here in person Mr. Beaumont.
The works, completely in order.
I've waited 10 years for this piece.
Hey Mickey, watch it!
Look! What do you think that is?
Coconuts?
That's a... That.
Pre-Islamic stuff you got in there!
Now slowly. Thanks!
Okay! Got it!
Oh yeah. This will make some very nice engagement gift.
- Very at least a nice engagement gift.
- Yeah.
Hi Nick.
- You're late.
- Sorry.
I'll give you 2000 for them.
So, what are we doing tonight?
"We"?
Ohhh, what's the matter Josh?
Are you afraid of the complications?
You know what?
I think this could help.
Does that help?
Yeah.
Yeah, where uh...
Where are we going tonight?
Dinner and a movie.
With me?
Yeah.
I was thinking more about, um...
...about hotdogs and a ball game.
Yeah.
Um... Are you...
Are you alright?
Alex?

Now is the time.
This is the hour.
Ours is the magic.
Ours is the power.
Now is the time.
This is the hour.
Ours is the magic.
Ours is the power.
THE CRAFT
Move your seat to the upright position, please.
Come on. Let's go.
Come on, darling.
The taxi's waiting.
Oh, yeah.
It's a lot drier in here, Dad.
Oh, God.
We need a new roof.
Yeah. But it's big.
I like the peg-and-groove floors.
Damask curtains would look really nice.
-Yeah. Gotta get this roof fixed, honey.
-Yeah.
I found this out back.
You want it?
Relax. What's the matter with you?
- Dad!
- What? What is it?
What the--
Get the hell out of here!
What the hell?
Sarah, you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
He just surprised me, that's all.
Yeah, I guess.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm fine.
You could wait-- just until you got a school uniform.
You don't have to go now.
I can't stay home and watch daytime TV for the rest of my life.
Why not? I could.
I just want to get started and get it over with.
- You look good. Good luck.
- Thanks.
-Jenny'll pick you up.
- I'll walk.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
Hey, scary bitch alert.
Oh, God! I thought it was Satan.
Jesus Christ. She looking?
- Oh, God.
- Oh, she's looking.
Okay, I'll find a warm place-- safe, warm place.
The almanac says today will bring an arrival of something.
Yeah, wonderful.
I'm getting my rag.
A new wholeness, and with it a new balance.
Earth, air, water, fire.''
Maybe it's our fourth.
We don't need a fourth.
Nancy, we need someone to call out the corners-- north, south, east and west.
Four would make a circle.
Maybe she can be our fourth.
I love a woman in uniform.
Bonjour, class.
What?
Oh, you mean did I get laid?
Beaucoup de laid.
What is that snail trail over there saying about me?
You know, this is LA.
We should be learning Mexican.
That would be Spanish, genius.
She's here.
- She who?
- Someone to be the fourth.
She's the one.
You feeling okay?
That's her.
Hi. Do you guys mind if I sit with you?
'Cause I'm supposed to find a lab group.
Okay.
No, you can sit here.
Happy?
What?
- You're Sarah, right?
- Yeah.
Hi. I'm Chris.
I just wanted to apologize for those guys in French.
They're assholes.
You know what they say.
You are what you hang with.
Yeah, right.
Wait. Did you just call me an asshole?
- You did, didn't you?
- I'm sorry. My defenses are up.
People here have been really rude to me.
Really? Who else?
These three girls.
They're behind you.
Don't stare.
That's slick.
Oh, shit.
It's the bitches of Eastwick.
- What?
- Whatever you do, stay away from them.
- Why?
- You see the one on the right?
She's a major slut.
I don't know from experience or anything, but--
And the one in the middle, she's got burn scars all over her body.
I haven't seen them, but friends of mine have.
Anyway, they're--
Nah. Never mind.
What?
They're witches.
Witches?
That's what people say.
So what are you doing after school?
I don't know.
Nothing, I guess.
- Really?
- Really.
I'm busy.
Football practice.
You can come and watch.
Football practice.
That is so tempting.
Looking for someone?
Some of these football dicks make their girlfriends... come and watch them practice, as if it's interesting.
Yeah, like, girlfriend, over there--
Chris Hooker.
I don't even know him.
Nancy's sorry about what happened in biology.
And she's mean to everybody, so don't take it personally.
You're Nancy?
She's Nancy, I'm Bonnie and that's Rochelle.
- Hi. I'm Sarah.
- Yeah, we know who you are.
Do you want to go for coffee?
No, I can't. I gotta get home.
My dad's waiting for--
You can make something up.
Rochelle's ditching practice.
He comes on to anything with tits, Sarah.
Except me.
I'm not watching him.
He spreads disease.
I speak from personal experience.
Whoa, Chris! Go long!
Go for the pass, baby!
He's a jerk.
Come on.
- So you're coming, right?
- Where are we going?
Shopping.
Come on.
I don't have any money.
We get a five-finger discount.
Five-finger discount.
Sarah, where'd you live before?
San Francisco.
- Why'd you move?
- 'Cause it sucks.
My dad wanted to.
- Sucks here too.
- I know. You need a car here.
You need a car everywhere.
What's up with that?
I slit my wrists.
Sorry.
What'd you do it with?
With a kitchen knife.
You even did it the right way.
Yeah.
Punk rock. Let's go.
The right way  ?
How do you know the right way?
Shut up, Rochelle.
How do you know?
What?
Put this in your bag.
No.
Everything in nature steals, you know.
Big animals steal from little ones.
They steal for survival.
- Besides, I already have a diary.
- This is different.
You put spells and power thoughts in it... and then you don't let anyone else read it, ever.
Except maybe us.
Here.
You guys are really into all this?
Sort of.
That's not for you.
I'm sorry.
What a beautiful ring.
It was your mother's.
Yeah, it was.
Are you going to pay for those?
Uh-huh.
You're not like your friends.
You know how to use candles?
Yeah. You light the wick.
More than that.
Red is for love.
Black--
Actually--
Why you don't read that?
- It explains it all.
- Okay.
Twenty dollars.
You know, I've never read anything about this stuff before.
I mean, I don't follow it.
Maybe you're a natural witch.
Your power comes from within.
Come on, Sarah.
You guys, I think
I should head home.
Just look straight ahead and keep up.
Please? My baby needs some food.
- I don't have anything.
- Don't give them money.
- You're gonna get nailed.
- I don't have anything.
I know you.
I have another snake for you.
Wait a second.
I have to talk to you.
I had a dream about you.
In my dream, you were dead.
I'm talking to you.
Come back to Jesus, child.
- Don't you run away from me!
- I am the door, the way--
I know what I'm talking about!
I'm in touch with the man!
Listen to me!
Come on, Sarah.
Let's get out of here.
Oh, my God!
What is it? Do you think there's anybody back there?
It hit him. The car hit him, and we made it happen.
- Maybe, maybe not.
- Definitely.
I thought to myself,
It's gonna hit him.
- I thought it too.
- Sarah, did you think it?
- Yeah.
- Then that's it. Sarah's the fourth.
North, south, east and west.
We can make things happen.
- This is it. This is real.
- Shit.
You guys, this is really weird.
Well, I mean, he was after you.
He was gonna hurt you, man.
It's not our fault.
You guys, maybe he'll really listen now.
Who?
Manon.
What's that?
That's like God?
No. Man invented God.
This is older than that.
Do you guys worship the devil?
It's like God and the devil.
I mean, it's everything.
It's the trees, it's the ground, it's the rocks, it's the moon.
It's nature.
If God and the devil were playing football...
Manon would be the stadium that they played on.
It would be the sun that shone down on them.
So, does stuff like tonight happen to you a lot?
No. Not like that.
Other stuff.
Where did you learn it?
I don't know.
A natural witch.
I hate it.
It's always getting screwed up.
It's like, sometimes
I'll want it to rain... and a pipe will burst in my room and it'll just get flooded.
- Yeah, right.
- No, really.
Or I'll want it just to be quiet... and I'll wish for it, and I'll go deaf for three days straight.
If you can do that... have you ever heard of invoking the spirit?
It's when you call him.
Manon.
It's like--
It's like you take him into you.
It's like he fills you.
He takes everything that's gone wrong in your life... and he makes it all better again.
Nothing makes everything all better again.
Maybe not foryou.
Where are you going?
You guys are freaking me out.
Oh, she's scared.
Nancy, we need her.
Like a hole in the head.
She'll be back.
You sounded strange when I called last night.
- I didn't think you'd come.
- No, just surprised.
- Surprised?
- Yeah.
I thought you'd be hanging out with those girls.
- What girls?
- Those girls with the weird heads.
What's weird about their heads?
That one girl, she's got a mammoth head.
Really?
Yeah. She looks like a St. Bernard.
I haven't noticed her.
I hate that big head thing.
'Course it's better than that shrunken-head thing.
Little, tiny-- Makes you want to hang it from a rearview mirror.
What is your obsession with heads?
I was just noticing how great yours is.
- You like my head?
- Yeah. It's a good head.
- It's a good head?
- It's good.
It looks good for kissing.
Can I?
All right, we'll see you later, bro.
Nice meeting you, Sarah.
Yeah. Bye.
See you.
Come on. Let's go to my house.
Nobody's there.
I don't want to go.
I can't.
I gotta go home.
All right.
Are you mad?
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
So, hot stuff, how'd it go?
- How'd what go?
- Your date with Chris.
What are you talking about?
Chris already told everybody.
He told everybody what?
That you guys did it.
But we didn't do it.
Maybe he was just trying to save face then... because... he's going around the whole school saying that... you're the lousiest lay he's ever had.
And coming from him... that's pretty bad.
- No, he didn't.
- He did.
He said the same thing about Nancy.
Told you he was a jerk.
Can I talk to you for a second?
I'm sorry.
Chris is really busy.
Maybe we could set something up for-- nice jacket-- later in the week.
What do you think?
Why'd you lie about me?
Look, I don't want to go out with you again.
Okay?
Please stop begging.
It's pathetic.
Fuck you.
Nah.
But I will.
She's gonna cry, and then I'm gonna cry.
We're all gonna cry.
Someone just doesn't want to go in the pool.
- Come on.
- This is a joke.
I can't even believe this.
Oh, wait. Here she goes.
Shark!
- Brilliant. Superb.
- Very good. It was great.
Oh, God, look.
There is a pubic hair in my brush.
Oh, no, wait. Wait.
That's just one of Rochelle's little nappy hairs.
Why are you doing this to me, Laura?
Do you think you're funny?
You really want to know why?
Yes, I really want to know why.
Because I don't like Negroids.
Sorry.
I've told you this before, but I want to be really clear.
This is a very experimental procedure... and we can't make any warranties regarding results or side effects.
I can tell you unofficially that there's little to no risk.
With this form of gene therapy, it's relatively noninvasive.
It can be somewhat painful, but noninvasive.
Okay. Try to stay relaxed.
I'm moving the armature over you now.
And you'll feel a little sting when the needle penetrates.
And then more when the needle moves.
I'll try and keep it as brief as possible.
Hold very still, but keep breathing.
Okay?
Good. Keep your body relaxed.
Just a little more, Bonnie.
Don't move.
Ray, the light's out!
Oh, man!
You didn't even pay the bill.
I gave you the money.
What are you doing home so late?
You're late!
It's the storm, Grace.
It's the connection.
- Oh, it's the storm?
- That's why the lights are out.
Neighbor's lights aren't out.
Got a light?
I give you money.
You tell me you pay the bill.
You can't even pay a bill?
What are you good for?
You know what I'm good for.
We're going on a field trip.
Miss Downs, I hate to interrupt your little social gathering.
Sorry, Sister.
You girls watch out for those weirdos.
We are the weirdos, mister.
Earth, air, fire, water.
Earth, air, fire, water.
It is better that you should rush upon this blade... than enter the circle with fear in your heart.
How do you enter?
With perfect love and perfect trust.
It is better that you should rush upon this blade... than enter the circle with fear in your heart.
How do you enter?
With perfect love and perfect trust.
It is better that you should rush upon this blade... than enter the circle with fear in your heart.
How do you enter?
With perfect love and perfect trust.
That's a girl.
As above... so below.
I drink of my sisters... and I ask for the ability... to not hate those who hate me-- especially racist pieces... of bleached-blonde shit like Laura Lizzie.
Right on.
I drink of my sisters... and I ask to love myself more... and to allow myself to be loved more by others-- especially Chris Hooker.
I know it's pathetic.
Definitely pathetic.
I drink of my sisters... and I take into myself the power to be beautiful... outside as well as in.
I drink of my sisters... and I take into myself... all the power of Manon.
That's all?
Blessed be.
Thought you were gonna burp.
Oh, my God.
What?
Look.
It's Manon.
It's so beautiful.
He's listening to us.
- Do you think it's working?
- I don't know.
I think he just looked at me.
Did he look at me? Is he looking?
- Not right now, but he just did.
- So weird.
I know. Now he's looking.
- He's looking?
- Yes.
Is he still back there?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Never mind.
It's working.
That or he's gone completely crazy.
- You hate me, right?
- No.
- You don't?
- No.
'Cause, you see, when you're a guy-- and I am-- people expect things.
I mean, I know I said some nasty things about you.
- Did you tell your friends?
- What?
That you're a lying sack of shit.
No. But I will.
I'll tell them tomorrow.
I'll tell the truth.
Good.
- Can I sit with you in Mass?
- Yeah, sure.
Watch this.
Chris, could you carry these for me?
- They're really heavy.
- Yeah.
And Bonnie's too.
She's got a bad back.
And this. Thanks.
I can't believe it.
Could you hold my jock for me?
It's kind of heavy.
In the book of Genesis--
What are you, Stepford boy?
Sit.
Pay attention.
It's working.
Check it out.
Her spell is working.
Nancy, oh, my God.
Would you look?
Oh, great. Really bad.
- Get one in, already.
- It's hard, you know.
You're, like, two feet away from each other.
- Get off!.
- I'm not that heavy.
Yeah, you're light as a feather... during deep space travel.
I am, actually.
Did you ever play that game,
Light as a feather, stiffas a board  ?
One girl lays down, and you surround her... and you put your fingers underneath.
You put your fingers where?
Okay.
Now you take your index finger... and your middle finger... and you put it under her like this.
Now you have to imagine that she's incredibly light... like she's made out of air.
Now, is that her whole body, or just her head?
Cow.
You guys, concentrate or it's not gonna work.
I think I sprained my finger.
- Shut up!
- Focus!
Come on, you guys.
Ready?
Light as a feather, stiff as a board.
Light as a feather, stiff as a board.
Holy shit.
You guys, it's not working.
Shut up, or you're gonna fall.
How do I get down?
Who's got the instructions?
Just keep concentrating.
Amazing.
Hi. I got clean towels for everyone.
- Oh, my butt!
- What's going on in here?
- Nothing. Why?
- Are you girls getting high?
Are you okay?
You gotta try it.
So I say we all chip in for it.
How much can you give?
You pulled my hair out!
Sorry. I thought I saw a bug.
They have shampoo for that, you know.
Stupid bitch.
- Laura really has split ends.
- Really?
I guess this confirms she's not a natural blonde.
Bleach.
What do you think will happen to Laura?
I don't know.
If she leaves you alone, nothing will happen to her.
Nothing good.
Fat chance.
Who's that?
That's my real mother.
Where is she?
She died when she was having me.
Sorry.
It's okay.
Manon, take my scars.
Give me beauty outside as well as in.
Manon, take my scars.
Thank you.
Don't hit your head on the board.
Put a lid on it, Laura.
Oh, my God.
What? What happened?
I don't know!
What does it look like?
I don't know.
Hold still.
Gross!
- Is there a mark?
- Did you hit your head on something?
Now, I want you to remember that we may need to make several passes... before we can see any results.
Is it better?
I can't tell yet, dear.
Just a minute.
What does it look like?
I don't know.
Just wait.
I can't believe it.
It worked.
- What?
- It worked.
'Cause seriously, if you don't stop it, you can go blind.
Hairy palms?
She was supposed to come back today.
Did you talk to her?
Principal Draper has called a special assembly... during the second half of the fifth per--
Homeroom starts at 8:45 sharp.
Sorry.
My pedicure ran late.
- Wow.
- Holy shit.
- Hi, Bonnie.
- How's it going?
- Yeah, how's it going, Bonnie?
- My God.
You look so beautiful.
I can't believe it.
You did it.
No, I didn't do it.
- Yeah, you totally did it.
- I helped.
Come on. You made Chris love you.
You own him.
You made Laura Lizzie's hair fall out.
You guys should see her.
She has to wear a hat every day now.
Poor Laura.
What's wrong with Nancy?
- Her spell's not working.
- What spell?
I don't know. I think she doesn't want to be white trash any more.
And I told her,  "You're white, honey.
Just deal with it."
Good.
Okay. Come on, come on.
- I can almost see through this thing.
- Leave me alone!
- God!
-Jesus!
You're supposed to act like a father to the girl.
- I ain't her father.
- Thank God.
Her father's the one who paid you the
50 bucks for a bang in the back seat.
Damn it!
- Don't you ever hit me!
- Don't you touch her!
Stop!
What the hell was that?
Oh, my God!
Pig.
Ray?
Oxygen is flowing.
What's happening?
What's happening to him?
I know this is a difficult time for you... but it is procedure that I ask just a few questions... before we can start processing the policy.
I don't understand.
What policy?
Mr. Saunders had a whole life pension plan through the company... and with benefits this size... it's standard that I--
What size?
Just a second here.
Sorry.
A hundred--
Wait. Are you saying that this goes to us?
To you.
A hundred and seventy-five--
What a dear, sweet man.
I can't believe he's dead.
- Do you think we killed him?
- No. Not at all.
Now don't be shy, honey.
Nice ass.
- What? He has a cute butt.
- You're a slut.
- Maybe you should go ask him out.
- You know it.
Yeah.   I like your butt.
Do you want to have dinner?
This is nice.
Bedroom, bathroom, nightmare.
You look so pretty. I'm so glad you could come and see our apartment.
Our apartment.
We have an apartment!
And it's so big.
And look at this view.
- It's beautiful.
- And the couch--
This is our couch.
I love this couch.
I saw it in the window and said,
I have to have this couch.
And the guy, what an attitude.
I said,    Honey, wrap it up.
I'm taking it right now.
Cash!
My juke box.
Every song on here is by Connie Francis.
Yeah! Isn't that great?
Ever since I was a little girl
I said...
All I want in life is a juke box... that plays nothing but Connie Francis records.''
That's great.
Who's Connie Francis?
Oh, shut up, honey.
Listen and learn. Connie Francis.
Can you come to my room, girls?
- Let's go.
- It was nice to see you, Mrs. Downs.
Connie Francis is--
Wait a minute here.
Let's have a little house warming party.
Sorry, Mom.
This is cool.
Ooh, nice.
I was reading and I found something
I thought you guys might be into.
Glamour. Throwing a glamour-- an illusion so real as to fool an onlooker-- is one of the oldest forms of magic.
- Bet you I could do that.
- Do you think?
This is to feel.
This is to be.
Shape and form it... for all to see.
By the power of three times three... as I will it... so shall it be.
What?
My eyes are brown.
They're usually green.
You can do that with contacts.
Yeah, but it's good.
I mean, it suits you.
Subtle. But good.
You want something bigger?
- I want bigger.
- Bigger.
We have to concentrate.
Come on.
Ready?
Are you impressed?
- Yeah, I'm impressed!
- You look like Loni Anderson.
- You want to touch it?
- Yeah.
It's real!
And so much simpler than going to a salon.
- Yeah, a really shitty salon.
- You try it.
Wait. Watch.
- Make me a blonde.
- Me, me, me.
I don't think so.
No way.
Do something to me.
What do you want?
A smaller ass.
Sarah!
Sarah!
Oh, no. No.
Why didn't you answer the phone?
It's 3:00 in the morning, Chris.
Oh, yeah, that's a good reason.
You know what I was thinking?
Maybe we could move in together.
I don't think I'm ready for that kind of commitment right now.
Oh, shit.
It's just that I can't stop thinking about you.
I don't know why, but I think I love you.
I've never loved anyone before, except... maybe my mom and this little puppy
I had when I was little.
I think you should go home, Chris.
No! Sarah, wait, please.
Sarah, please. Look.
I don't know what's happening to me.
I can't eat. I can't sleep.
Can I help you?
No. Nobody can help me.
Here again.
What can I do for you today?
We need provisions.
I need to undo a love spell.
When you open a floodgate, how do you undo it?
You unleash something with a spell.
There is no undoing.
It must run its course.
You should let him suffer.
It's not for you to judge suffering.
When do we find out what's behind the curtain?
What are you doing, hiding all the missing kids from the neighborhood?
What's there? Black magic?
True magic is neither black nor white.
It's both because nature is both.
Loving and cruel, all at the same time.
The only good or bad is in the heart of the witch.
Life keeps a balance on its own.
You understand?
Not really.
Well, then understand this.
Whatever you send out you get back times three.
Wait. We didn't read that in any book.
No, it's part of a basic spiritual truth... said in many ways in many faiths.
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
I wanna buy this book.
You want to invoke the spirit?
You must be experienced to do this.
It's very dangerous.
Look, lady, I'm a big girl, okay?
Now please just sell me the book.
- How much?
- Twenty-five.
What do you know?
I have money.
When things were the worst for me... just before I tried to kill myself...
I used to hallucinate things.
I'd close my eyes, and all I would see were... snakes and bugs everywhere.
Then I'd open them, and they'd still be there.
They wouldn't go away.
They're everywhere.
You know, the serpent is a very powerful being.
You should respect it.
Aren't you powerful?
Yes, you are.
All right.
Enough screwing around.
Let's call the corners, shall we?
Hail to the guardians of the watchtowers of the east... the powers of air and invention.
Hear me!
- Us!
- Hear us.
Hail to the guardians of the watchtowers of the south... powers of fire and feeling.
Hear us.
Hail to the guardians of the watchtowers of the west... powers of water and intuition.
Hear us.
Hail to the guardians of the watchtowers of the north... by the powers of mother and earth.
Hear us.
Aid us in our magical working on this May's eve.
Serpent of old... ruler of deep... guardian of the bitter sea... show us your glory... show us your power.
We pray of thee.
We invoke thee.
O serpent one, hear our calls.
Hear our prayers.
Ancient wise one... teach us thy ways.
We summon and stir thee.
Lend us your powers.
Show us your glory.
We invoke thee!
Manon, fill me!
Is he here?
Did you feel that?
He blessed me.
I can feel him running through my veins.
He's still in me.
It's so amazing.
Look at this.
It's so beautiful.
This is a gift.
These are my gifts!
I can feel you in me!
I'm your daughter now.
He's everywhere!
He's in everything!
Listen, all I'm saying is
I think it's enough already.
I don't know what's going on with this.
I'm completely humiliating Chris... when all I wanted was for him to like me.
And Bonnie, what's going on with you?
You used to be nice.
Now you're completely narcissistic.
Excuse me, but I spent a big chunk of my life being a monster.
Now that I'm not, I'm having a good time. Sorry if that bothers you.
Can you guys tell me what color that light is?
It's red.
Doesn't red mean stop?
Yeah, red does mean stop.
It's like what Lirio was talking about-- throwing things out of balance.
I know you thinkwe're getting what we want now... but it's going to come back to us threefold.
Are we actually having a theological conversation here?
I mean, it's fun, it's scary.
I mean, who gives a shit?
Oh, Nancy, we do.
What do you guys think?
- They don't think.
- Bitch!
Stop trying to win them over, because it won't work.
I'm not trying to win them over.
You're paranoid.
- I'm paranoid?
- Paranoid.
I am not paranoid!
- Paranoid.
- Will you guys shut up!
Do you want in, or do you want to leave this circle?
Just tell me right now.
Why must it always be that way with you?
Because that's the way it is!
All I'm saying is,
I think you should think.
And I don't want out.
One of these times, the lights not gonna be green.
Oh, waah!
We're scared, Sarah?
You scared, hmm?
That was actually pretty close.
It just keeps falling out.
I don't understand it.
What did I do to deserve this?
Laura!
What's the matter?
What happened?
I don't know.
Calm down. Calm down.
It's okay.
I'm gonna go get somebody, okay?
Stay right here.
Sarah, come on, please.
You look like you need to talk to someone anyways.
How do you know what I look like?
We're talking on the phone.
Look, it's important.
I just need to be alone with you.
I have to see you.
I don't know why, but--
Why are you being this way?
It's just dinner. Come on.
I don't know.
Please.
Okay. Tomorrow night.
Yes! Yes! Yes!
- I'll see you then.
- Bye.
So when I started hanging out with them, I was almost relieved.
I didn't have that many close friends in San Francisco.
It just felt really nice to belong.
I disagreed with them once, and they turned their backs on me.
That's not friendship.
- Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.
- You do?
Yeah. Sometimes it's like we're one person. Know what I mean?
No, I'm not sure.
I'm not sure either.
That's so funny.
I was just thinking,
I have no idea what I'm talking about.
Aren't we supposed to go to a restaurant or something like that?
No.
All right. Look, Chris.
I know you think you feel really intensely... but do you ever stop and wonder where it comes from?
I can't think.
I just feel.
It's weird how it happened.
One day, I couldn't wait to see you.
It's like that every day, but now that I have you, I'm not letting go.
Stop and think about what you're saying.
You don't even know me.
Here. I'll give you a back rub.
I don't want a back rub.
I don't want you to. Just let go.
Just relax for a second.
Turn around.
- I think you should take me home.
- No! Sarah, come on.
- Take me home, okay?
-Just hold me, okay?
- Let go.
- Hold me first.
Fine. I'll walk.
Goddamn it!
Sarah, get back--
Come back here.
- Goddamn it!
- Please, Chris! Let go of my arm!
Stay still!
No! Please!
Let go!
Oh, my God.
Sarah, come here.
What happened?
Are you okay?
You should've seen the look in his eyes.
It was so weird.
They seemed empty, like it wasn't even him.
Where would he be?
There's a party.
At Trey's.
Just leave it alone.
Don't go.
You're not going to help anything.
I'm gonna go play.
I cannot believe she's here.
You guys...
Nancy Downs is here.
Nancy?
I'm here. You're here.
We're all here.
Is Sarah with you?
What's going on?
Where is she?
You and me, we've had some pretty good times together.
If I remember correctly... we had some pretty hot times too.
- Remember?
- I've been trying to forget.
Forget?
- Did you forget this?
- Stop.
What's the matter?
Not in the mood?
Not to get my dick bitten off.
What makes you think that's what I wanna do?
Go away.
Go away.
What the--
Surprise.
Make love to me, Chris.
We should not be here.
Neither should Nancy.
Rochelle.
How's it going?
Fine.
Listen.
You're a witch!
- They were right.
- They usually are.
- Nancy, get off the bed. Let's go.
- She's a witch too.
The only reason you're in love with her is because she cast a spell on you.
Yes. Sad, but true.
That's why I'm here-- to help you forget about her.
- What do you care?
- Nancy, get off the bed!
You scared the shit out of him.
Thank you very much. Let's go.
No! He's gotta pay.
You're just jealous.
Jealous? Jealous?
You don't even exist to me!
You don't even exist.
You are nothing.
You are shit.
You don't exist.
The only way you know how to treat women is by treating them like whores!
When you're the whore!
And that's gonna stop!
Do you understand?
Do you understand what I'm saying, huh?
I'm sorry.
He's sorry?
Oh, he's sorry!
He's sorry! He's sorry!
Sorry, my ass!
I didn't want him to get hurt.
I liked him.
I think that he was a good guy underneath it all.
I didn't know that it would go this far.
Honey, come on.
I mean, it's hard for you.
- It was an accident.
- Dad, I need to be alone right now.
- Please, honey, listen.
- Don't touch me!
Everything I touch turns to shit.
I bind you from doing harm, Nancy.... harm against other people... and harm against yourself.
I bind you from doing harm, Nancy.
Harm against other people... and harm against yourself.
Stop it!
Stop it!
There you are.
We've been looking everywhere for you.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
We heard the police came to your house.
They came to mine too.
Yeah. Well, I didn't tell them anything.
Then why do you want to leave the circle?
- I didn't say--
- You don't need to say it.
You're thinking it.
Look, people are dead.
Chris and Ray are--
Those were accidents.
- They deserved it.
- Says who?
Says me.
You know it's true.
Fine. Whatever. I'm out.
Fine. That's fine.
We don't really need a fourth anymore, do we?
But if you're gonna leave the circle... you might want to think about leaving the school.
And maybe the city too.
We're not sure.
Or the planet.
And please don't do any more spells on me.
I didn't--
You know, in the old days... if a witch betrayed her coven... they would kill her.
Bye!
Sweet dreams, Sarah.
How have you been sleeping?
Hello?
Yes?
Hello.
- Hi.
- What's wrong?
Oh, darling, what's wrong?
I know I don't know you very well... but I just didn't know where else to go.
It's those girls that I always come in here with.
They're trying to use magic against me.
You don't understand.
They killed people.
I tried to do a binding, and it didn't work.
And now, it's like everywhere I turn, they're all around me.
No matter what I do, they're still there. I don't know what to do.
You understand?
She's inside my dreams.
She knows what's going on inside my head. She can read my mind.
I'm so sorry. I just didn't have anywhere else to go.
Please.
Come.
What is this?
This temple is built on a place of power.
Sarah, you have a tremendous light inside you... more than any witch
I've ever known.
You must not be afraid.
I can't control it.
I always end up hurting somebody.
Do you hear the voice of your mother?
What about her?
She's telling you to be strong.
She was a witch, too, of course.
Didn't you know?
You can defeat those who challenge you... but you must surrender yourself... to the higher power.
You must invoke the spirit.
But it made Nancy crazy.
She takes it to a dark place.
- Don't be afraid. Invoke him.
- I can't.
There is no other way.
Hail to the guardians of the watchtowers of the north--
It's Nancy.
I can't stay here.
No, Sarah! Stop! Sarah!
Hello?
Dad!
Jenny!
- Hello?
- They're gone.
They flew back to San Francisco.
They thought you ranaway back home.
Look, Sarah... there's been an accident, man.
What are you talking about?
- What?
- It's been allover the news.
Go look at your TV.
Wreckage from the plane was scattered over a one-mile square area.
Authorities suspect severe wind shear... may have been responsible for today's tragedy.
FAA officials have retrieved the blackbox... and a full investigationi spending.
Onceagain,
Global flight 321... from Los Angeles to San Francisco has crashed with no survivors.
More on this story as details become available.
Oh, my God.
Please. Please stop it.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Go away, please!
- Stop it!
- Gotcha!
God, if I was as pathetic as you are...
I would have killed myself ages ago.
You should get on with it.
Where are my dad and Jenny?
You'll be seeing them soon enough.
You're going to kill yourself tonight, my dear.
No, I'm not.
Surprise.
Really?
Look in your eyes tells me... you might not be so sure.
After all, you have every reason in the world to do it.
I mean, you killed Chris... and you killed your mom--
You killed your mom when you were coming out of her.
Now, that is really special.
Even I couldn't go that low.
Bravo!
Stop it, please!
What's the deal?
Why doesn't she use magic on us?
Because she's weak!
Weak, weak, weak.
Stop, please.
Oh, God, you're so disgusting.
Now is the end.
Let her go in peace.
Now is the end.
Let her go in peace.
- I didn't write that.
- It doesn't matter.
Hand writing still looks the same.
What's wrong with your scars, Sarah?
It isn't real.
Then why are you still bleeding?
Run!
Run back up to your room like the little coward that you are.
That's right.
She's so pathetic!
Stop it!
- Please, somebody help me!
- I'm bleeding!
Please.
What can I do?
Rochelle, go upstairs.
See what's going on.
No. This whole thing is just--
Get your lazy ass up those stairs or I'll slit your throat!
- Dead as she is.
- Come on. I'll go with you.
Little shit.
Hail to the guardians of the watchtowers of the north... by the powers of mother and earth.
I invoke thee.
I invoke thee.
By the powers of three times three, make them see, make them see.
Bonnie?
My hair. My hair!
It's coming back times three.
Not again.
What happened?
Where are you going?
Hail to the guardians of the... watchtowers--
Don't be afraid.
Reach inside yourself.
Reach inside yourself.
Hail to the guardians of the watchtowers of the north... by the powers of mother and earth.
I invoke thee.
I invoke thee, Manon.
I invoke thee, Manon.
Did I frighten you, Nancy?
I'm sorry.
What's going on?
Why aren't you dead?
Came to me.
Saved me.
And he wanted me to give you a message.
You're in deep shit.
He says you've abused what he's given you and now you have to pay the price.
Did he?
He did.
By the way, what happened to Rochelle and Bonnie?
They rushed out of here without even saying good-bye.
That's bad manners.
What's going on?
What is going on?
Stop it! Stop it!
Relax. It's only magic.
Now who's pathetic?
Look.
I know I'm a little crazy.
I don't mean to be.
It all got out of hand, and I'm sorry.
No more games, okay?
Sarah, I'm so sorry.
Good.
- I'm gonna go.
- One thing first.
I bind you, Nancy, from doing harm... harm against other people and harm against yourself.
Wait.
Wait.
I called him before you!
You bitch! You bitch!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
Where are you?
Where are you, Sarah?
Where are you?
Tricky. Tricky, tricky, tricky.
I bind you, Nancy, from doing harm.
Hi, Sarah. How are you?
Good.
Then again,
I can sleep at night, so--
How are you?
We want to apologize.
- We feel really bad about--
- Trying to kill me?
Yeah.
Honestly, we never thought it would go that far.
Hi, girls.
How're you doin'?
Hi, Mr. Bailey.
And you know that thing on TV about the plane crash... was just a glamour.
It was a practical joke.
Funny.
Sarah, wait.
We were just wondering, do you still have any powers?
'Cause we don't.
Sorry.
So if you ever want to just hang out... and chant or call the corners--
Maybe.
Hold your breath until I call.
She probably doesn't have any powers anyway.
Be careful.
You don't want to end up like Nancy.
It's you. It's you.
He gave me power.
I can do whatever I want now.
I can fly.
He gave you somethin', honey, but it ain't the power.
But I can fly. I'm flying.
I'm flying.
I'm flying.
{6350}{6378}Lisa?
{6386}{6416}Rusty?
{6429}{6454}How's New York?
{6457}{6477}It's great.
{6480}{6516}They wanna use this.
{6526}{6583}But they're looking for a new concept.
{6586}{6640}Something more timeless they say.
{6643}{6712}Whatever that's got to do with tracked housing.
{6724}{6763}What're you doing with that thing?
{6789}{6819}Protection.
{6995}{7019}Daddy?
{7022}{7110}Hi sweetheart.|- Hi. Welcome home ...
{7123}{7260}For me? You shouldn't have.|- Actually, sugar, it's not.
{7263}{7293}No, this ...
{7315}{7390}This is what our house has been missing.
{7418}{7447}Gunrack?
{7466}{7516}My bright and cheerfull son.
{7522}{7562}Hey, Rusty I missed ya.
{7601}{7643}Well, open it.
{8273}{8312}It's ugly as hell.
{8320}{8400}I like it.|- Come on, it's an antique.
{8411}{8543}The guy who sold it to me told me it probably crossed|the Atlantic on the schooner over two hundred years ago.
{8549}{8594}Maybe on the Mayflower.|- Oh, Jake.
{8607}{8682}And I bet he sold you that Hitler's pencil box too.
{9040}{9073}Just ...
{9087}{9138}it'll complete the scene.
{9451}{9495}Wow, it's a ...
{9498}{9544}creepy.|- ... unique.
{9547}{9583}I like it.
{9598}{9658}It was practically free.
{9661}{9749}It came from one of those houses|to be torn down for the development.
{10855}{10885}Good night, pumpkin.
{10888}{10920}Night, daddy.
{10932}{10985}Rusty, sleep well.
{10994}{11023}Whatever.
{11281}{11315}How's the collage?
{11340}{11378}Graduate school.
{11384}{11428}There's a difference.
{11455}{11478}Yeah.
{11499}{11548}About ten thousand bucks.
{11585}{11624}I'm sorry.
{11627}{11662}I'm a little giddy.
{11695}{11735}Jet lag.
{11811}{11862}Look, before you take off ...
{11872}{11957}I just wanna to thank you for coming over|and taking care of my family.
{11963}{12006}I know it was short notice, but ...
{12009}{12046}there was nobody else.
{12053}{12144}I couldn't miss that meeting.|- Of course, you couldn't. It's okay.
{12174}{12238}God knows I've always loved this house.
{12256}{12304}It was nice seeing your kids again.
{12307}{12349}They're all right, aren't they?
{12352}{12371}Yeah.
{12374}{12405}Yeah.
{12410}{12502}Might spend more time|with Rusty though. He's alone a lot.
{12516}{12552}Rusty?
{12560}{12603}He's a trooper.
{12609}{12648}He'll be fine.
{12682}{12726}How did you and Lisa get on?
{12737}{12779}Still tough.
{12795}{12881}I mean she misses her mother,|I mean that's not gonna change, right?
{12893}{12995}That's not coming back.|I can't compete with a dead woman.
{13000}{13032}God.
{13036}{13100}We had a three days and all comes back.
{13112}{13187}Same feelings, same patterns ...
{13226}{13262}Jesus Christ.
{13291}{13343}But we did talk about boys once though.
{13346}{13392}For the record his name is Andy.
{13395}{13442}I think he plays lacrosse.
{13446}{13491}That's all I could get out of her.
{13572}{13613}Listen to that.
{13726}{13781}Are you sure you don't wanna spend the night?
{13828}{13906}Jacob, we go thru this every time. I mean ...
{13940}{14003}I hate having regret for a breakfast.
{14006}{14030}No.
{14037}{14069}The storm ...
{14095}{14141}that's all I promise.
{14193}{14246}Unless it gets real cold.
{14293}{14372}You know I'm seeing someone.|- Leonard.
{14384}{14431}We can invite him over too.
{14505}{14547}Leave in the morning.
{14603}{14651}It'll be a river out there.
{14734}{14766}I'll be gentleman.
{14855}{14895}I promise.
{16081}{16145}Such theatrics, Jake.
{16167}{16208}I'm impressed.
{16324}{16358}Variety.
{16392}{16488}I got tired of trying to make the earth move every time.
{16653}{16681}Last night ...
{16684}{16722}in my hotel room ...
{16801}{16863}I imagined you're here in this bed.
{16905}{16963}Like it used to be before you left.
{17044}{17127}Don't get nostalgic on me, Jake.|It doesn't become you.
{17130}{17192}And you're so tough, aren't you?
{17242}{17294}It's because you're so dangerous.
{17390}{17429}You're having doubts?
{17472}{17512}Doors is always open.
{17552}{17590}Maybe I've changed.
{17636}{17663}I don't think so.
{17683}{17729}I lived here for four years.
{17753}{17804}Why should anything change?
{17820}{17921}I should've called you last night, but it was past three.
{17961}{18000}Three o'clock in the morning?
{18045}{18100}That damn clock.
{18158}{18217}I had it in my hotel room.
{18236}{18297}It's incredibly noisy.
{18368}{18442}Of course harder I tried to sleep ...
{18458}{18492}the noisier ...
{18495}{18564}it got the louder of the thinking got.
{18749}{18801}God, I'm tired.
{18951}{18981}Jake?
{21426}{21451}Peaches?
{21480}{21522}What're you doing out this late?
{21652}{21677}Here you go.
{21781}{21825}Well, excuse me.
{21923}{21978}Picky, picky, picky.
{22081}{22114}Oh, shit!
{22159}{22186}Come back, here.
{22318}{22348}Peaches?
{22685}{22708}Peaches.|Come here.
{22796}{22819}Peaches.
{22822}{22843}Come on.
{23072}{23093}Peaches!
{23096}{23120}Come on.
{23155}{23196}You scared me there.
{23202}{23232}Come on.
{23237}{23271}What are you doing there?
{23274}{23303}Come on.
{23369}{23389}Go.
{23404}{23427}Go on.
{24201}{24228}Wow.
{24950}{25009}You gotta be fucking kidding me.
{25869}{25977}What're you doing down there?|- Jesus. Shit, dad. You scared the crap out of me.
{26014}{26049}I said!
{26058}{26105}What're you doing down there?
{26149}{26182}Nothing.
{27241}{27276}Anything I can do?
{27289}{27327}No, we got it.
{27371}{27418}Ride's here. Let's go, Rusty.
{27432}{27477}Bye, dad!
{27488}{27526}See ya, Andrea.
{27551}{27615}Are you gonna be here when we get home?
{27658}{27696}Okay, next week, huh?
{27733}{27773}Maybe we'll go shopping.
{27802}{27822}Okay.
{27861}{27895}Bye.|- Bye.
{27924}{27946}Come on.
{28049}{28092}Goodbye Rusty.
{28098}{28128}Whatever.
{28303}{28341}Is all cleared out?
{28353}{28402}It's gonna be a beautiful day.
{28428}{28508}Didn't you use to be able to see|across the Andersons yard?
{28527}{28553}Yeah.
{28560}{28602}So, their hedge's growned.
{28614}{28696}Actually it's about two feet over the neighbourhood code.
{28706}{28767}But it's not worth make us to think about it.
{28770}{28808}What time's your class?
{28811}{28837}Noon.
{28840}{28881}I'll sleep in here.
{28888}{28912}You want it?
{28916}{28950}Of course not.
{29020}{29055}Make yourself at home.
{30026}{30069}Peaches, come baby.
{30101}{30174}Peaches, really should be on the leash, Mrs. Tetmann.
{31285}{31309}What?
{31435}{31499}High technology, you gotta love it.
{31878}{31902}Hi there.
{32704}{32765}Get off me.
{33771}{33805}Mrs. Sterling?
{33833}{33877}Oh, actually I'm ...
{33895}{33992}Yes. Hi.|- Well, he suffered some discomfort, but he'll be okay.
{33995}{34122}Now, first concern is rabies.|You said it was a neigbourhood dog?
{34127}{34244}Um, yeah. Mrs. Tetmann, but I wasn't there.|I mean, Jacob just came home and ...
{34247}{34345}Yes, what I see it's a good idea|to double check, you know.
{34348}{34498}If this Mrs. Tetmann is in the slightest|bit unsure about when the dog was vaccinated,
{34501}{34551}her vet should have the records.
{34557}{34733}Otherwise we will need to begin the rabies shots|immediately. And uh ... nobody wants that, right?|- No, no. Of course not.
{34736}{34857}Or maybe he should just stay here.|- No, it won't be neccesary. He'll be up on his feet soon.
{34860}{34895}How soon?
{34982}{35052}You're just need to keep an eye on the wound.
{35055}{35161}Change the dressing every eight hours or so.|- Yeah, okay.
{35172}{35207}Well, is there anything else?
{35210}{35377}Oh, you may experience mild nausea|due to the antibiotic. So careful what you feed him.
{35389}{35455}Also I'll put him on percodan for the pain.
{35471}{35546}Mood swings are common side effect.
{35549}{35574}Thank you.
{35819}{35890}Jesus, teen lust's really disgusting.
{36009}{36032}Want a smoke?
{36036}{36069}No, I quit again.
{36155}{36186}Going to class?
{36189}{36223}Absolutely.
{36246}{36270}Tomorrow.
{37009}{37041}Come to finish the game?
{37044}{37069}Rusel?
{37093}{37121}Shit.
{37203}{37230}Holiday?
{37243}{37282}Mental health day.
{37289}{37319}Your move, Iris.
{37432}{37453}Mate.
{37500}{37531}My luck, I guess.
{37574}{37598}Iris?
{37636}{37707}Some strange shit ...|happened last night.
{37714}{37756}I know.
{37770}{37791}You know?
{37794}{37811}So ...
{37814}{37833}what?
{37836}{37887}Depends what did you see.
{37890}{37948}Well, it's kinda dark, you know, but ...
{37951}{38021}I think our living room turned into another room.
{38055}{38143}It's old and, and the crappy and then back again.
{38170}{38203}Is that all?
{38219}{38251}Isn't that enough?
{38264}{38294}It fears you.
{38297}{38407}Trying to make friends. win you over.|- So, it. Like what? Like the devil?
{38410}{38429}No.
{38432}{38485}This is the real thing.
{38497}{38603}It's very old and I think it's travelled a long way.
{38606}{38654}Why here?|I mean ...
{38657}{38699}evil in Bulrwood.
{38704}{38830}All things considered it hardly seems worth the trouble.|- It'd only move for one reason.
{38856}{38917}Where was safe is no longer.
{38923}{38978}It must find a new home.
{39353}{39392}I'll come around.
{39395}{39431}Are you okay?
{39462}{39502}Shit, Jake.
{39516}{39566}Why did you have to go and do this?
{39582}{39689}I got so much work to do.|I've got a paper due on thursday.
{39692}{39740}I was going out of town this weekend.
{39743}{39805}Well, no good deal because I'm punished.
{39808}{39847}Well, wasn't that truth.
{39888}{39953}Why does this remain me about our relationship?
{39956}{40093}Me dropping everything for what you're doing.|- What the hell do you want me to say?|This wasn't planned.
{40141}{40204}Oh, Jake, it's always been this way.
{40208}{40238}You know it.
{40298}{40333}Is this your theory?
{40336}{40381}I'll let Dr. Leonard work it out.
{40388}{40433}He's a therapist, isn't he?
{40436}{40493}No. He's a psychiatrist.
{40500}{40613}And for your information I've always been|quite capable of analyzing my own feelings.
{40616}{40655}You just never listened.
{40666}{40697}He does.
{40795}{40825}Okay.
{40828}{40851}This is it.
{40854}{40902}I'll stay a couple of days.
{40905}{40955}I'll sleep on the couch or something ...
{40958}{40999}till you're back on your feet.
{41002}{41106}But then I'm not here Jake and|I'm not coming back and not even as a favor.
{41232}{41274}Oh, no!
{41300}{41349}It hurts my eyes.
{41578}{41618}Poor baby.
{41654}{41695}Oh, honey.
{41791}{41824}How does it feel?
{41839}{41880}I'm cold.
{42023}{42061}I, I will clean it out.
{42064}{42127}This may hurt a little bit, okay?
{42182}{42292}Ahh! No!|- Sorry, I'm sorry. - No.
{42295}{42395}Honey, the doctor says we have to keep it clean.|- Give me that!
{42417}{42442}Please.
{42473}{42515}I'll do it by myself.
{42518}{42557}Just leave me alone!
{42800}{42833}What're you doing here?
{42836}{42877}Shouldn't you've been in school?
{42887}{42916}Shouldn't you?
{42930}{42963}Look, Rusty ...
{42968}{43053}your dad had an accident.|He's been bitten by a dog.
{43064}{43087}What?
{43125}{43149}Dad?
{43159}{43201}Just let him rest, okay?
{43204}{43289}Now, do you know this Mrs. Tetmann?|Do you know where she lives?
{43301}{43352}Mrs. Tetmann, sure she ...
{43365}{43393}Peaches?
{43507}{43608}Mrs. Tetmann, I'm Andrea ...|Jacob Sterling's friend.
{43619}{43755}Uh, yes, well about today. I hope the Peaches is all right.|Jacob said he cut her face pretty badly.
{43768}{43872}Um, anyway the doctors have urged me|to check for rabies vaccinations.
{43881}{43920}What're you talking about?
{43924}{43985}Your dog, Peaches bit Jacob.
{43988}{44036}Peaches doesn't bite.
{44052}{44114}With all due respect Mrs. Tetmann ...
{44126}{44257}Jacob was viciously attacked.|I mean he only got away by slashing her face.
{44270}{44305}You're crazy.
{44308}{44338}Can we see her?
{44443}{44468}Come here, Peaches.
{44471}{44492}Come here.
{44679}{44791}I don't understand.|Jacob said he knew the dog.|- Well, something's wrong.
{44822}{44877}It's like this Skull Krusher song.
{44885}{44922}Evil rules ...
{44925}{44968}it has the tools.
{44974}{45046}The world is your oyster to grab or uncloister.
{45071}{45134}Save it on the right. This is not the time.
{45145}{45211}It's not just me. Mrs. Wheeler saw it too.
{45214}{45264}What? Saw what?
{45295}{45323}Evil.
{45338}{45367}Evil?
{45373}{45430}Oh, of course.
{45436}{45556}Look, Rusty I think Mrs. Wheeler sees|a lot of things coming that never arrived, right?
{45559}{45734}So let's just leave this weird stuff. This zombie, voodoo,|metal - head view of the world alone for a while, okay?
{45934}{45964}Jake?
{46102}{46141}Oh, god.
{46194}{46233}New concept ...
{46322}{46360}timeless
{46438}{46490}Jacob?|- Yeah ...
{46503}{46528}that's it.
{46558}{46619}Timeless new concept.
{46634}{46674}Bold ...
{46721}{46757}Enigmatic ...
{46764}{46806}and bold.
{46860}{46918}Much bigger than this too ...
{46968}{47003}Jacob ...
{47006}{47043}Why are you up?
{47075}{47254}370 thousand square feet of modern living space|artfully perched above the San Gabriel Valley ...
{47286}{47346}with easy access to ...
{47354}{47406}major shopping areas.
{47485}{47554}This what my life has been reduced to.
{47629}{47699}Oh ... you're running a fever.
{47729}{47758}Andrea?
{47834}{47874}Are you gonna come back?
{47926}{47954}Come on.
{47964}{48078}Let me get you back in bed, right?|- Thousands ... is too small!
{48247}{48270}Too ...
{48273}{48299}damn ...
{48302}{48337}small.
{48445}{48497}Think they'll have to put Peaches to sleep?
{48500}{48553}Once a dog tastes blood ...
{48562}{48601}he wants more ...
{48604}{48659}and more.|- Rusty ...
{48662}{48694}What did we talk about?
{48705}{48748}What?|Any dog.
{48762}{48857}Not just one who was possessed by demonic force.|- Enough!
{48874}{48923}Lisa, where do you keep phone book?
{48932}{48968}I don't know.
{48996}{49025}I'll get it.
{49038}{49101}It's true tho' about dogs.
{49104}{49168}This guy at school once brought|this coroner's case book.
{49171}{49229}And in was hardly found this old lady.
{49232}{49295}She died a week before and no one knew ...
{49298}{49330}except her poodle.
{49333}{49374}He's starting getting hungry.
{49377}{49418}By the time they found her ...
{49421}{49475}the little mud put on a few pounds ...
{49478}{49546}and the old lady loss some,|if you know what I mean.
{49632}{49687}Think that I keep thinking about is, ...
{49692}{49747}when did the poodle decide to eat her?
{49750}{49796}It's not the first thing he thought of.
{49805}{49887}Just a sat around, expecting dinner as usual, ...
{49890}{49967}And then said: fuck this, she's kibble.
{49970}{50003}Taking a bite.
{50037}{50078}Where do you think he started?
{50343}{50381}What happened to you?
{50428}{50452}What?
{50481}{50546}You got up, walked out in the middle of dinner.
{50573}{50629}Saved your plate on the range.
{50659}{50681}Thanks.
{50684}{50719}I've been looking for this.
{50748}{50776}Where'd you go?
{50907}{50950}You'd never believed me.
{51117}{51172}Dr. Leonard Stafford, please.
{51182}{51222}Oh, it's Jacob.
{51225}{51274}He was bitten by a dog.
{51277}{51362}He's torn apart by the goddamn dog.
{51391}{51446}It'll be at least a few days.
{51490}{51565}Oh, honey I'm sorry about this weekend.
{51613}{51639}What?
{51704}{51733}Me too.
{51761}{51784}Bye.
{51843}{51882}Is that your boyfriend?
{51885}{51911}Haba, haba.
{51914}{51956}Haba, haba?
{51959}{51995}What's all that?
{52015}{52081}I always sleep on the coach nights.|You can have my bed.
{52104}{52198}That's very thoughtful, Lisa.|- Yeah. Well, I figure you're old.
{52201}{52264}We don't want your arthritis acting up..
{52430}{52521}Andrea, when dad gets better, you're leaving, aren't you?
{52530}{52600}You know, honey.|You know I love your dad.
{52621}{52668}But there're things, you know.
{52676}{52727}The choices that we made.
{52732}{52851}He knows if they're right or if they're wrong.|But I do know we can't live together.
{52862}{52893}Not now.
{52896}{52935}I think it's a cop - out.
{52938}{52966}Why?
{52969}{53052}Because you and dad din't try hard enough.
{53082}{53230}I don't know. Maybe when you get older it just get simply|let things go rather than fight for what you want.
{53247}{53367}I'm treating you like a kid and you know|a lot more than I did when I was your age.
{53383}{53406}So ...
{53417}{53459}how's Anthony?
{53493}{53521}Andy.
{53527}{53599}Oh, he's fine I guess.
{53602}{53675}He's got most beautiful smile and ...
{53724}{53766}And what?
{53788}{53928}What?|- He's got the cutest butt hard as anything I swear to god.
{53940}{54039}I wish I didn't feel like such a kid|when I'm around him.
{54055}{54116}I think he's got an eye on a senior.
{54130}{54169}Give it time.
{54226}{54287}Where're you going?|- Say goodnight to dad.
{54356}{54393}Lisa, wait a minute.
{54411}{54474}Hey there, princess.|- Hi daddy.
{54488}{54556}Well, it looked worse.|- When?
{54559}{54605}I'll get back to you on this.
{54609}{54645}Are you going back to hospital?
{54648}{54667}No.
{54670}{54801}The doctor says I'll be fine right here.|Just need a few days a rest.
{54823}{54871}So the next couple of days ...
{54874}{54935}I want you to be real nice ...
{54946}{54987}to Andrea.
{55992}{56043}Oh, fuck.
{56068}{56126}Off the switch.
{56163}{56200}Okay.
{56582}{56609}Who is it?
{56675}{56707}Andrea?
{56726}{56815}Can I sleep in here?|Living room's really creepy.
{56818}{56849}Sure, honey.
{56856}{56900}Go get your pillow, okay?
{57456}{57482}Hello?
{57538}{57566}Dad?
{57579}{57615}Andrea?
{57791}{57835}Rusty!
{57864}{57889}And ...
{57943}{57981}I'm stucked!
{58160}{58199}Dad!
{58245}{58306}Somebody open the door!
{58314}{58373}I'm getting scare, open the ...
{58593}{58653}Don't turn the light on if you need to, honey.
{58998}{59033}Sweet dreams.
{59059}{59081}Good night.
{59200}{59228}Lisa?
{59596}{59683}Open the door! - Lisa?|- Somebody open the door!
{59686}{59713}Lisa.
{59728}{59761}Open the door!
{59833}{59850}Lisa!
{59857}{59906}Oh, honey what happened?
{59949}{59990}Somebody locked the door.
{60394}{60421}Rusty?
{60688}{60716}Where've you been?
{60768}{60799}Went for a walk.
{60802}{60835}Oh, a walk.
{60838}{60904}You went for a walk at three o'clock in the morning?
{60924}{60984}Yeah, I had to think about some things.
{60987}{61056}Oh, well I hope you figured them out.
{61294}{61332}Peaches.
{61446}{61486}Peaches!
{61512}{61588}Come on, girl it's cold out here.
{61662}{61704}Peaches?
{61757}{61815}What did you get it to?
{62541}{62657}I live here for a couple of years|and what you know it's. This's just ridiculous.|That woman could help there.
{62724}{62807}The man he's with her, it's his son.|It's his son.
{62810}{62862}Go talk to her.|Yes, that across the street.
{62988}{63104}It's terrible. What happened?|- Mrs. Sterling, is your son at home?
{63107}{63285}Oh, no he's not my son. I'm Andrea Livingston.|I'm staying with Mr. Sterling, but Rusty's not here.|- Rusty?
{63288}{63327}Rusty Sterling?
{63331}{63376}Yes, he's in school.
{63379}{63450}You don't think Rusty had anything to do it.|- I'll tell you what.
{63453}{63573}Why don't you give us a call when he gets home.|We'll make a special trip out here.
{63643}{63686}Thank you, Miss Livingston.
{64489}{64523}Jacob?
{64618}{64667}Jacob, honey we need to talk.
{64770}{64819}I think Rusty's in a trouble.
{64941}{64968}Not right.
{64981}{65056}Not right. Not right concept.
{65079}{65115}Timeless.
{65190}{65238}Aren't you gone yet?
{65350}{65403}Jacob, I'm talking to you.
{65472}{65538}I'm gonna call the doctor.|- No!
{65571}{65607}I feel fine.
{65614}{65663}I'm a little under the weather, uh?
{65668}{65720}Perhaps not up to speed ...
{65730}{65802}but I got work to do and you're not helping me.
{65866}{65927}I'm facing a deadline.
{66898}{66938}{y:i}Timeless.
{67174}{67268}You know, Rusty I gotta to tell you we don't get|a lot of calls like this up here in Burlwood ...
{67271}{67349}And with the high school|just a couple of blocks away, well ...
{67352}{67408}it seems kinda cut and dried, you know.
{67425}{67539}Then I was thinking you know you're sharp kid,|you'd come from a nice family ...
{67555}{67684}Maybe got some not so nice friends. If they|were doing something like this you'd know about it.
{67687}{67742}I don't know everything they do.
{67746}{67806}I don't know everything anybody does.
{67825}{67891}So, how can you be sure they didn't do it?
{67911}{67977}I didn't say they didn't. I said they wouldn't.
{67980}{68093}Now we're gonna find out what happened.|If not from you then from one of your buddies.|Where's that gonna leave you?
{68096}{68133}So, let's have it.
{68226}{68281}Rusty, for godsakes.
{68847}{68876}Hi.
{68945}{69004}Hey, hey. It's okay.
{69016}{69060}I should've called you.
{69094}{69196}Oh, Leonard, I'm sorry. I guess ...|I've just been holding all this inside.
{69209}{69357}It's really silly.|- No, it's not and you just let that out.|That's what I'm here for.
{69405}{69446}What is this?
{69456}{69573}This is fine wine. And this is fine|'take out' and I thought we could have a picnic.
{69583}{69639}A picnic?|- Picnic.
{69677}{69719}I hope you brought egg rolls.
{69722}{69795}Yeah, of course. That food it's delicious.
{69871}{69899}Rusty?
{69995}{70029}Rusty.
{70084}{70108}Rusty?
{70262}{70297}Rusty!
{70394}{70435}This is my friend Leonard.
{70438}{70469}Call me Lenny.
{70473}{70494}Hi.
{70510}{70551}Nice shoes, Lenny.
{70635}{70671}How about some dinner?
{70696}{70851}Lenny bought some chinese food.|- Laotian actually. - I ordered a pizza. - Okay.
{70859}{70884}Sure.
{70967}{71022}It's nice meeting you there, Rusty.
{71043}{71119}Rusty, right? I hope that later on we can ...
{71133}{71188}open up a little dialog.
{71191}{71212}Okay?
{71359}{71381}Dick!
{71499}{71537}Oh, Jacob.
{71556}{71691}You remember Leonard? He teaches at the university.|- Yeah, I heard about your leg. I'm ...
{71756}{71810}Jeez, uh that's pretty bad.
{71813}{71951}You know if it's painful I might have something for you.|Andrea tells me that you don't wanna see a doctor.|I really think that you should.
{71954}{72037}I'm a doctor myself and I really think that ...
{72068}{72116}you should've that looked into.
{72316}{72379}Jacob, why aren't you let me help you with that?
{72488}{72568}Come on. Let's go.|- A lot of hostility there.
{72803}{72846}You wanna know what I think?
{72895}{72949}Yeah, I guess I'm ready for it.
{72952}{72982}I think ...
{72996}{73111}that your skin is so soft and smooth and warm.
{73114}{73156}It's a porch lighting.
{73242}{73364}You're cought in the midle of the classic|interdependent destructive relationship.|- Is that right?
{73367}{73486}Upstairs in the hallway the way he played you.|It's a perfectly choreographed. Look ...
{73491}{73594}one side, there's Jake. He's disabled|former lover. Then there's you.
{73597}{73764}You're soft, you're warm, you're bright, you're fresh.|But you're still caring a burden of guilt from the break up ...
{73787}{73845}that he needs you. He needs you.
{73848}{73976}But he denies all your eforts. And he struggles|nobly against these obstacles what he sets up for himself.
{73986}{74090}He feeds himself without symphathy.|He nurses himself with your guilt.
{74093}{74178}And in the end he makes it look|like he's doing all this for you.
{74228}{74311}Leonard, he was seriously hurt by the dog.|- Was he?
{74314}{74435}You yourself said that he lied about ever cutting|the dog's nose and that woman denied|that it ever even happened.
{74438}{74501}You don't think, he could have done that to himself.
{74599}{74665}Oh, god.
{74739}{74789}You always see so clearly.
{74810}{74850}Is that good or bad?
{74873}{74927}No, sweetie, it's wonderful.
{74936}{74991}I knew it from the moment we met.
{75043}{75070}It's just it.
{75073}{75093}What?
{75096}{75145}Last night, what about that?
{75148}{75252}Me wasn't in a dream.|There was something in my bed I felt it.
{75255}{75325}I turn the light on and ...|- it wasn't there.
{75339}{75407}Stress. It's a classic stress related syndrom.
{75410}{75433}You know ...
{75470}{75593}The subconscious is a very powerfull effect,|not on reality, but on perceptions.
{75596}{75619}But Andrea ...
{75622}{75816}I was not thrilled that by you coming to babysit for|this guy in the first place. And now you're simply beeing|drowned deeper and deeper into his world.
{75826}{75906}I know the pain you've been thru. I love you.
{75909}{75986}I don't wanna see you go thru this anymore. Please.
{76026}{76084}He scares me, Leonard.|- Is he violent?
{76087}{76123}Is he violent?
{76135}{76166}No.
{76192}{76228}Not yet.
{76238}{76360}All right, I'll tell you what. There's doctor Grover,|he's an old friend of my fathers.|He works in the Psychiatric ward.
{76363}{76497}If there's any other trouble I would have,|Jake admit it like that. Okay?
{76500}{76622}No problem. He's a friend of mine. No records.|- God, everything's gonna be all right.
{76666}{76693}Of course.
{76762}{76970}Second's walk, minute's run, year's fly, decade's done.
{76978}{77001}It's true.
{77019}{77059}What time is it?
{77113}{77156}I don't know, my watches stopped.
{77286}{77313}Oh, my god.
{77351}{77439}Andrea?- No. - Andrea wait!|- Please, god. - Andrea! - No!
{77453}{77487}Wait.
{77525}{77569}Mr. Andersen, what happened?
{77578}{77619}Hedges caught fire.
{77635}{77709}Gotta say I don't see how with all the rain lately.
{77718}{77747}Here, take this.
{77776}{77816}Careful that making ...
{77854}{77940}I guess, we were pretty lucky.|It could have been a lot worse.
{77943}{77967}Lucky?
{77985}{78002}Yeah.
{78005}{78095}Lucky that neighbourhood didn't get caught.|- So, how's Mr. Sterling doing?
{78100}{78142}Um, he's ... he's better.
{78145}{78171}Slowly.
{78174}{78201}It takes time.
{78208}{78255}Well, this ought to cheer him up a bit.
{78258}{78321}Hedges are well below code now, huh?
{78341}{78377}Gimmy that.
{78476}{78504}Oh, god.
{78509}{78565}What? No goodnight kiss?
{78630}{78695}Just hang on, I think my house is burning.
{78716}{78758}What happened?|- Where's your brother?
{78761}{78812}I don't know, I just got here.
{79294}{79317}What's up?
{79320}{79370}What the hell do you mean: what's up?
{79373}{79477}This house almost burned down.|- What can I say I've  been there all night.
{79480}{79516}All night?
{79527}{79590}I took piss around 7:45.
{79593}{79695}Sorry, I didn't call you.|- Look, Rusty something is going on here!
{79698}{79767}So, that I'm trying to tell you, but you don't listen.
{79770}{79815}It's an evil force.
{79823}{79937}The only evil force in this house is you.|- That's what it wants you to think.
{79940}{79972}Stop it.
{79979}{80043}You're headed for real trouble here.
{80191}{80248}Level pyromaniacle nazi.
{80251}{80413}Down the hall you've got a toxic lunatic in the|master bedroom. The only one around here that seems|normal is Lisa and that's because I haven't met her yet.
{80416}{80508}I wonder what kind of secret she has in her closet.|You know, barbie doll vivisections.
{80511}{80686}Pagan rituals ... - Oh, god, stop it.|- Isn't there an aunt or like a grandmother|who can take over for you here? You've done enough!
{80689}{80719}You've done enough.
{80722}{80867}You don't understand. This was my home.|I used to live here.|- That's right! You used to, you used to! No more.
{80896}{80929}I'm sorry. I don't mean to yell.
{80932}{80987}I don't yell. How much more can you take!?
{81010}{81052}They're almost my family.
{81055}{81118}You still love him. You still love him.
{81146}{81252}No, Leonard, I don't know. That's not true.|- You want him back?
{81255}{81369}Maybe because you dumped him|the only way you can rationalize being with him|now not as a lover, but as a mother?
{81372}{81435}Oh, god. This is unfair ...
{81439}{81466}doctor.
{81469}{81548}Will you tell me I'm wrong? Will you tell me I'm wrong?|- You're wrong.
{81590}{81616}I'm wrong?
{81718}{81762}Is Quasimodo still asleep?
{81957}{81980}I'm wrong.
{84308}{84367}High technology, you gotta love it.
{84381}{84420}Put it here, pal.
{84721}{84790}Good firm grip. You play squash?
{84793}{84948}Look, I just want take a second here. Let's you know|how much I appreciate your coming over|and taking care of my family.
{84967}{84999}God knows.
{85002}{85057}I've been in no shape to do it.
{85061}{85097}I owe you one, buddy.
{85172}{85198}So ...
{85242}{85275}you're a doctor.
{85278}{85300}Okay?
{85334}{85407}Yeah, I'm a psychiatrist.|- A doctor.
{85410}{85458}Sick o sick, right?
{85478}{85524}Whether it's upstairs ...
{85573}{85608}or down in the basement.
{85660}{85709}Did I tell you I went to med school?
{85737}{85774}Almost.
{85787}{85850}Uh, no, you didn't.|- You bet.
{85853}{85929}But I ended up studying, drafting ...
{85939}{85985}major in architecture.
{85991}{86029}And I built things ...
{86032}{86075}Lots of things.
{86107}{86176}But sometimes god I gotta tell you ...
{86235}{86276}Don't make I'm weird.
{86282}{86355}Sometimes I got the urge to tear them down.
{86358}{86510}Just get a hold of the wrecking ball|and level blocks and blocks of ranch style homes.
{86516}{86554}You don't say.
{86625}{86683}You must experience the similar thing.
{86720}{86805}I mean, you spend all day just healing people.
{86819}{86869}Making them feel better.
{86903}{86953}Don't you ever wanna hurt'em?
{86977}{87013}Make them bleed.
{87016}{87055}Balance the book.
{87077}{87109}Cleannessly.
{87153}{87199}Relax.
{87222}{87266}Take a look at this puppy.
{87305}{87368}It's a worth of a piece 38K.
{87371}{87414}A click quite old.
{87442}{87476}Worth a lot.
{87511}{87560}German construction.
{87566}{87622}The SS used to carry these.
{87631}{87721}Some of the Berlin police still use them today.
{87737}{87837}Or they're actually being replaced|by more sofisticated signed arms.
{87840}{87901}It's a terrific piece of machinery.
{87908}{87962}Incredibly accurate.
{88017}{88056}It never jams.
{88063}{88135}Just a workable art to look at.
{88154}{88224}But I guess it's day's past.
{88273}{88320}I'll tell you one thing though.
{88358}{88512}You turn this puppy on some asshole and you can slip|your wrist through the hole it'll leave behind.
{88629}{88701}Are you fucking Andrea?
{88715}{88746}My Andrea?
{88789}{88913}Don't lie to me, you bastard fornicator.|- What're you talking about?!
{88927}{88945}Look!
{88948}{89024}You guys have a relationship and I'm not part of that.
{89027}{89069}And what about tonight?
{89098}{89136}Are you going to fuck her?
{89139}{89167}Here ...
{89171}{89322}in my house? - No.|- And over the dresser just down the hall|where we used to sleep together? - No.
{89333}{89356}No.
{89362}{89385}No.
{89399}{89497}You fucked her.|- No. - Don't lie to me.
{89636}{89664}Yes.
{89682}{89731}I did it, okay?
{89773}{89819}And what about after?
{89822}{89847}What?
{89850}{89879}Lisa.
{89908}{89978}Are you going have my daughter?|- Never!
{89981}{90015}I'd never!
{90028}{90072}I can't let you do that.
{90090}{90138}You gotta stop you right here, ...
{90181}{90239}right now.|- No.
{90252}{90375}No!
{90847}{90890}What's going on here?
{98197}{98235}So, where's Leonard?
{98317}{98375}He just couldn't wait to get to work.
{98608}{98633}Rusty ...
{98731}{98771}Yesterday you said ...
{98784}{98827}there was evil here.
{98941}{98964}Yeah.
{99044}{99086}Well, what have you seen?
{99099}{99137}Strange shit.
{99178}{99205}A couple of nights ago.
{99208}{99263}Mrs. Wheeler said she saw it too.
{99266}{99290}What?
{99316}{99373}There's no sense in looking for.
{99380}{99460}It's not like ghosts and demons and shit.
{99463}{99522}So, I think it's inside of us.
{99529}{99569}It's in everything.
{99577}{99622}It's trying to make this house ...
{99625}{99657}it's home.
{99698}{99790}See, that's why I don't need a heart|to heart with your psychiatrist friend.
{99793}{99857}and when the doctors can't help dad.
{99860}{99940}He's suffering up there because what's in this house.
{99966}{100005}We need to get out.
{100299}{100345}I think you believe that, ...
{100390}{100431}but I just can't.
{101374}{101403}Morning.
{101476}{101538}Lisa, don't you think you'll be cold today?
{101586}{101642}No, I borrowed dad's jacket.
{101653}{101717}Think he'll mind.|- No.
{101806}{101825}Sweetie?
{101828}{101851}What?!
{101854}{101910}I don't want you going out like that.
{101997}{102038}Andrea ...
{102057}{102113}you're not my mother.
{102224}{102299}I'm gonna be going out with Andy again tonight.
{102324}{102365}Don't wait up.
{103036}{103119}So many questions. Sit down, Rusty.
{103122}{103164}That first night ...
{103167}{103221}you said there was a room.
{103224}{103311}Yeah, an old musty room, but I haven't seen it since.
{103376}{103418}Take me to this room.
{103425}{103469}I didn't go in there.
{103486}{103523}Describe it.
{103526}{103630}It's important. That's all|we have right now. Come on, Rusty.
{103633}{103670}You can do it.
{103673}{103714}Concentrate.
{103721}{103762}Close your eyes.
{103805}{103837}All right.
{103893}{103930}All right it was ...
{103961}{104003}It was weird.
{104025}{104056}It was ...
{104094}{104123}dark.
{104191}{104222}There was a ...
{104226}{104268}a cloth.
{104299}{104388}Pictures made of cloth.|- Tapestries. - Right.
{104402}{104455}on the walls and ...
{104487}{104539}candles, black candles.
{104550}{104584}There was a ...
{104610}{104666}thick wood table.
{104670}{104735}Like a butchers block in the center.
{104738}{104763}And ...
{104773}{104909}there's knives and saws.|There's something carved on the table like a ...
{104929}{104993}a symbol.|- Pentagram.
{105026}{105049}How'd you know?
{105052}{105089}Go on, go on.
{105180}{105211}There were ...
{105253}{105316}manicles and ...
{105358}{105401}chains and ...
{105412}{105451}Oh, god.
{105466}{105528}It's to hold someone down on the table.
{105536}{105584}It's, it's small.
{105592}{105636}It's too small.
{105639}{105681}It was for children.
{105712}{105742}What?
{105981}{106050}Never seen this picture before?
{106053}{106117}That's it. That's the room I saw.
{106127}{106186}You never seen this picture before?
{106189}{106238}It is rather famous.
{106290}{106504}That room belong to Gilles de Rais.|- That's the room I saw, I swear.|- Oh, I believe you.
{106507}{106591}And I think you may have been looking back in time.

{106669}{106788}De Rais run the school for boys in|he was a teacher, minister ...
{106792}{106896}inventor and necromancer.|- What? - Oh, it's ...
{106904}{107105}Means an eater of the dead. They say de Rais had |a habbit of choosing some of the best and brightest|ifrom his classes and eating them.
{107108}{107140}Should I ask why?
{107143}{107288}Poor fool thought that by eating their flesh he would|gain their youth and therefore become immortal.|- Okay, so what does it mean?
{107291}{107440}Don't rush to understand, Rusty.|Just listen and feel.
{107443}{107545}It began the night your father return from where?
{107555}{107594}Back east.

{126861}{126901}Oh.|Yes.
{127062}{127127}Indeed.
{127290}{127326}Oh, thank you.
{127368}{127407}Lisa.
{127657}{127684}Lisa?
{127710}{127746}Are you down here?
{127750}{127812}Why don't you come down and find out?
{127920}{127975}You did very well, Andy.
{128087}{128121}Oh, Lisa.
{128134}{128189}I liked this game.
{128222}{128411}Now I want you to wait right there tilI I give you a signal.|- Lisa. You're giving me nothing, but signals.
{128414}{128502}I want you now.|- Don't ... come any closer.
{128505}{128537}Not yet.
{128559}{128635}You could be a gentleman,|though and toss me your jacket.
{128922}{128958}Varsity, right?
{128995}{129044}You ready for the big leagues.
{129123}{129197}Why don't you take off the rest of your clothes?
{129220}{129257}Oh, Lisa.
{129268}{129327}I can't take it any longer.
{129760}{129804}Choo - choo.
{129814}{129856}All aboard.
{129859}{129961}You won't regret this, I swear.|- You might.
{130081}{130132}What did I step in? The storm drain?
{130160}{130199}Hey, what's that?
{130235}{130264}I'm sinking.
{130302}{130333}Lisa.
{130336}{130365}Lisa, help.
{130422}{130452}Oh, god it burns
{130455}{130507}Oh! Oh, god it burns.

{130857}{130901}Bye.
{131247}{131283}Bye.
{131441}{131508}Rusty, I'm not so bad after all.
{135114}{135143}Leonard?
{135165}{135192}Honey.
{135195}{135231}What's wrong?
{135257}{135292}The water.
{135295}{135353}What?|- Blood.
{135381}{135424}What're you talking about?
{135485}{135541}There's somebody here.
{136215}{136253}Are you sure?
{136263}{136404}Yes. I can only rely on the evidence,|but judging from it, I would conclude that|I've lost my mind. Now is he asleep?
{136409}{136456}Yeah, he's out like a light.
{136459}{136523}What the hell is going on here?|- Well, somehow Jake is behind on all of this,
{136526}{136684}Now I don't know which case is parapsychal|psychological projecting where he's creating with the|raging forces inside of him or he's doing it with mirrors.
{136687}{136724}I don't care.
{136727}{136793}Where the hell is the ambulance that I called for?
{136822}{136875}Oh naturally. It's dead! It's dead!
{136884}{136934}All right the car. I've got a phone in the car.
{136937}{136993}I want us out of here.| I want him out of here!
{136996}{137082}Okay, I've gotta make this phone call.|You just get everyone together in the living room.
{137085}{137116}Hey.
{137123}{137163}You must be Lisa.
{137203}{137240}Very bad.
{137251}{137279}Lisa?
{137293}{137327}Are you all right?
{137332}{137415}Yeah ...|I think I'm in love.
{137432}{137485}Excuse me, I'm gonna change.
{137515}{137575}Is Andy around yet?
{139385}{139421}Oh, god.
{140482}{140517}My god.
{140529}{140560}Leonard.
{140765}{140793}Jake?
{140910}{140959}Jake? Is that you?
{141107}{141170}Jacob, I really wanna help you.
{141204}{141231}I do.
{141243}{141268}Really.
{141331}{141363}Jacob!
{141540}{141576}Rusty.
{141589}{141631}Where is he?|- I don't know.
{141668}{141733}I don't know.|Leonard is dead.
{141736}{141831}So is Mrs. Wheeler.|- What? - How did you get this far?
{141834}{141930}What? What is happening?|- It's the clock.
{141933}{141986}Makes people evil.
{141998}{142038}It got dad?
{142041}{142134}I think it got Lisa. Where is she?|- How could does clock this?
{142137}{142175}Not any clock.
{142178}{142241}This clock ... what's been.
{142244}{142281}You have to trust me.
{142289}{142328}We have to get out of here.
{142360}{142385}Okay?
{142412}{142441}You listening?
{142800}{142862}It's Lisa. Get out.|- Rusty!
{143012}{143037}Lisa?
{143317}{143346}Lisa?
{143435}{143476}Rusty.
{143674}{143712}Thank god.
{143736}{143824}Until last week I've never taken|a single call from Burlwood.
{143835}{143931}What did I tell you?|We should have never let that Sterling kid go home.
{144789}{144816}Lisa?
{144939}{144988}God,  it's so horrible.
{145032}{145061}Lisa?
{145082}{145113}Are you okay?
{145131}{145174}This date's so horrible.
{145238}{145280}We gotta get the hell outa here.
{145305}{145374}So horrible.|- What is?
{145407}{145445}That you're my brother.
{145694}{145733}It's pretty quiet, huh?
{145754}{145804}Help me!
{145835}{145900}God damn it, can you help?!
{145991}{146039}God damn it!
{146042}{146089}Open the door!
{146204}{146237}God, this ...
{146265}{146294}Open it!
{146349}{146387}No, the door.
{146391}{146440}Open the fucking door!
{146464}{146494}Nobody home?
{146502}{146564}Another action-packed night in Burlwood.
{146652}{146689}Get out!
{146843}{147004}What in the hell is happening here?|- It's got nothing to do with hell, Andrea.
{147039}{147080}Heaven and hell.
{147116}{147183}Purgatory, limbo.
{147229}{147277}Myopic Andrea.
{147306}{147455}Such a small view of the world.|- Oh, god.
{147728}{147782}This is about power.
{147802}{147868}Power and sacrifice.
{147978}{148022}I love you.
{148299}{148402}I felt your eyes on me for a longest time.|- Yeah?
{148405}{148430}Feel this.
{148628}{148673}I like that.
{148707}{148814}Will you spank me too?|I've been real bad.
{148970}{149025}Come on, Rusty.
{149045}{149098}Just give me a little kiss.
{149112}{149198}Pucker up. This could be your last chance.
{149650}{149683}Jacob?
{149697}{149740}This isn't you.
{149744}{149776}Honey.
{149807}{149847}This isn't you.
{149966}{149994}That's it.
{150001}{150028}That's it.
{150055}{150093}It's Andrea.
{150109}{150143}It's me, baby.
{150543}{150639}Hold still.|- Here I come.
{151479}{151505}Stop!
{151659}{151687}Rusty!
{152331}{152370}My life ...
{152407}{152471}is a mess, Andrea.
{152476}{152541}And you ruined it!
{152589}{152625}Noo!
{152628}{152675}My pride ...
{152682}{152730}end here for son.
{153013}{153115}Noooo ... !
{155491}{155539}... wana spend the night.
{155591}{155638}I'll be gentleman.
{155652}{155701}I promise.
{156255}{156286}Rusty?
{156321}{156366}Oh, baby come here.
{156372}{156409}That's it. Come on.
{156414}{156451}Come on, baby.
{156486}{156569}Yeah. Go wait outside, okay?
{156572}{156616}Mommy will be right out.
{156824}{156894}He will get out. Understood?
{157852}{157891}It's time.
{160472}{160502}Oh, my god.
{163288}{163311}Hi.
{163380}{163411}I'm home.
{163420}{163468}Lisa? Rusty?
{163480}{163508}They're asleep?
{163552}{163642}How's New York?|- It's great. They wanna use this.
{163645}{163748}They're looking for a new concept.|Something more timeless they say.
{163765}{163830}Whatever that means with tracked housing.
{163891}{163935}What the hell are you doing with that?
{164006}{164028}Protection.
{164031}{164060}Daddy?
{164070}{164103}Hi sweetheart.|- Hi. Welcome home ...
{164172}{164240}For me? You shouldn't have.
{164244}{164308}Actually, sugar, it's not.
{164311}{164339}No, this ...
{164353}{164430}This is something that our house has been missing.
{164458}{164484}A gunrack?
{164511}{164579}Oh, my bright and cheerful son.
{164584}{164631}Well, open it.
{166373}{166420}What the hell was that all about?!
{166496}{166554}It's about time. That's what.
{167094}{167139}Pure evil.

- Honey... did you hear that?
- Hear what?
Barbara?
Did you hear that? I could have sworn I heard whispering.
You're reading my mind, that's all.
My thoughts sound like whispers.
Yeah? What were you thinking?
I love you, Doc.
You sure make it fun to wake up before dawn, I'll tell you that.
Frank?
- Did you finish last night?
- No.
Honey, it's a quarter to 6:00.
It's important.
Okay.
Thanks.
Okay.
That's everything.
Helium for the balloons!
I'm picking up a tank at Harold's right after I drop you off... per your instructions.
Did I think of that? Cool.
I must be starting to get this delegating authority stuff.
Well, Mrs. Magoo, I guess that's why they made you principal.
I guess so.
- Honey, don't smoke.
- Come on! You're going to make me crash.
I'll quit smoking when you decide to get pregnant, all right?
Guys!
- Hi!
- Hi.
- Be careful.
- Here I come.
Watch your step.
You all right?
Jill!
- Who's the chef?
- Oliver.
Great, I love burnt hot dogs.
Thanks. So when's Ben coming home?
Six weeks, four days and nine hours.
- Okay, watch the edges. Don't spill it.
- I got it.
Let's take it over here.
- Callie, how are you?
- Frank. Good. Good to see you.
Where's my helium?
- Say you love me, baby.
- Not until you get me my helium.
Righty-o. I'll get right on it, dear.
- You go here.
- Okay.
There's Jill. I've got those receipts here.
- How you doing?
- How the hell are you?
- All right, bye.
- Bye. See you later.
- Barbara!
- Frank!
Good morning, Sam.
And you must be Cindy.
It's nice to finally meet you.
Do you want to take a look around?
You'll really love this place.
- Harold.
- Morning, Doc.
- Frank.
- Doc, how the hell are you?
Heading over to the school fair?
I have to go to Butler County and make my rounds at the hospital.
You've got to try this muscle machine I made.
Show everybody how strong you are.
I don't know.
I should probably sit in the shade and watch you young guys do it.
- See you, tough guy.
- Right.
Okay. Thanks, Jill.
We need finger paints.
Okay. I'll get them.
Just put it on the table.
Finger paints. Okay.
Yikes.
Well, a civilian pilot spots the smoke.
Then I get here and find two of my officers passed out like babies.
Everything on that side of the white line is out cold.
So somebody starts talking about chemical weapons... and somebody hits a panic button, and then you people are calling.
- There you go.
- Look, there is no research lab.
There is no chemical plant.
There is no toxic waste dump.
There is no nuclear plant!
- There's no nothing around here.
- Okay.
Nothing on the news channels or news services. Nobody's got it yet.
Good.
I'm just going to take myself in there and get a look-see.
Ed.
- That's Frank McGowan's truck, right?
- What's left of it.
- Lucky you weren't in town today, Doc.
- What's going on here?
Nobody knows anything, not even that fed doctor down there.
She brought this whole circus with her, and they don't have a clue.
Go on out there and see what the hell's going on. Be careful.
- Stay here?
- Yeah, we're just waiting.
All right, good.
Pull him back!
Get him out of there! Let's go!
Get him down!
- Stay back!
- Excuse me.
Hits him like a hammer.
That's all we know.
- Some kind of chemical gas?
- No, it can't be.
The edges of the affected area are well-defined.
Stationary.
- Doc, this is Dr. Susan...
- Vurner. Like Turner, with a "V."
Epidemiologist,
National Science Foundation.
- Alan Chaffee.
- MD?
He's breathing. Good pulse.
I think he just fainted.
Is Midwich affected by this?
- My hunch would be, yes.
- My wife's in Midwich.
We tried calling for the last six hours.
Nobody picks up or calls out.
Could somebody please get me some blood and urine samples?
- What's the call?
You going? Okay, all right.
Just take it easy.
Somebody get him a blanket.
What happened?
Barbara?
Thank God. Are you all right?
Sweetheart, are you okay?
- I'm cold.
- All right, come on. Let's go home.
No.
Heavenly Father... we mourn these lives cut short... without warning or apparent purpose.
We search for a reason and find none.
We have become accustomed to the power of science... so when we were struck down, we turned to science and asked, "Why?"
But it could not answer.
So now we turn our eyes toward Heaven... and seek our comfort in God's infinite mercy.
Let us pray.
"Our Father, who art in Heaven...
"...hallowed be Thy name...
"...Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done...
"...on Earth as it is in Heaven.
"Give us this day our daily bread...
"...and forgive us our trespasses...
"...as we forgive those who trespass against us...
"...and lead us not into temptation...
"...but deliver us from evil.
"For Thine is the kingdom, and the power...
"...and the glory, forever and ever.
"Amen."
Did you ever hear of Charles Fort?
He wrote The Book of the Damned, about unexplainable things.
Like frogs falling from the sky, blue snow, red rain...
Are you suggesting I read him?
No. It's just that...
Sometimes mysteries don't get solved.
I mean, what if something like this happens again?
I don't know. What do I do?
Can I call you?
Well, of course, you can call me.
By the way, I suggest you read Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
Sherlock Holmes once said:
"When you've eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable...
"...must be the truth." it's not possible.
You made a mistake. Do it again.
Well, I don't have a problem running the tests again...
I have felt like this before in the morning.
It is just some kind of bug.
Melanie?
What's the matter?
- Maybe I can help.
- No.
You can't.
- There they are!
- Hey, guys!
We're empty! We need some more here!
Hi, how are you?
It's good to see you.
Hi.
Ben, this is fantastic.
Callie, look up and smile.
Ben, after a year in Japan... did you ever think you'd have to get used to being a dad?
Hello, Doc.
I said, "Hello."
- How long have you been standing there?
- Ages.
Liar.
Big boy.
Why are you kissing me like that?
I wanted to know first, so I used a home pregnancy kit.
Honey, you know those are unreliable.
And that's why I went to see
Dr. Cornright just to make sure.
Are you going to open it?
Alan?
Hi. You got a minute?
Sure.
Everything's positive.
You are pregnant.
We'd been trying, you know.
Look.
I wanted to tell you something before you hear it from somebody else.
There are a lot of pregnancies.
I mean, a lot.
Much more than would normally be expected.
What do you mean?
Is something wrong with my baby?
No, it's nothing to indicate that.
You're a normal, healthy young woman...
Alan, don't talk to me like a doctor.
Okay.
All the pregnancies seem to date from the day of the blackout.
No!
Dr. Susan Vurner has flown in...
This is all because of that blackout, isn't it?
- Just come out and say something!
- They don't know for sure!
They are all going to be deformed!
Wait a minute. That's not true!
Excuse me! That's not true.
There's no reason to believe that.
Barbara and I are pregnant.
We know how you feel.
We know what you are thinking, so let me say right now... the same thing I've told a lot of you individually.
The standard tests have not revealed one abnormality.
Anywhere. Not one. All right?
Let's listen to Dr. Vurner, please.
She's come to talk to us.
Dr. Susan Vurner, ladies and gentlemen.
I want to start off by saying we are all very concerned about your well-being.
But ultimately it will come down to individual decisions.
And I understand that these decisions will be probably the most intimate... personal, difficult decisions that you ever make in your life.
However, because your pregnancies have attracted intense scientific interest... including the National institutes of
Health and National Science Foundation... those of you who decide to have your child... will have all prenatal expenses paid.
You'll also receive $3,000 monthly as an allowance.
If you allow your child to be examined and tested on some sort of regular basis.
Is that $3,000 a family?
What if your wife and your daughter both have kids?
Then you would receive $6,000.
I don't want you to interpret this allowance as some sort of a pressure.
It isn't. It's your decision.
If you decide to terminate then, of course, you have the right to do that.
You can do it privately.
Or if financially unable, a medical team will be brought in next week.
- The choice is yours.
- That's killing babies.
Are you okay?
Ben's moving out.
He won't believe me.
What are you going to do?
I can't keep it.
I mean, it can't be Ben's.
I just don't...
I just don't understand.
Something very strange is happening to all of us, Callie.
You know, they say... the Roberts' girl is a virgin.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
I don't know.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
It was just a dream.
Okay.
Let's go back to sleep.
What's going on, doctor?
Nothing.
They have apparently decided to keep their babies.
All of them?
Why?
That's a very good question.
Keep pushing! Push!
Okay, here we go. Here we go. Almost.
Almost done! Good, Mom. That's good.
Push, push, push.
That's it. That's it.
You're doing great!
Take a deep breath.
Deep breath and push!
Push, push, push!
Come with that. Push a little more.
- Push, Barbara, push.
- A little more. A little more.
Push. Push.
Help me!
We've got a problem!
ICU, now!
- Push, push, push!
- Come on!
- There we go!
- Good, Barbara!
And there we go.
Beauty! Looking great, sweetie.
Good job.
It's a girl, honey.
She's fine.
- There we are. Clamp this.
- Look, here's your baby.
He's beautiful.
Ben.
Come on, just breathe once. Oxygen.
- Watch the BP.
- Just relax. You're hyperventilating.
Push. Doctor, get your ass over here and help me!
Bear down on her! Push!
All right, here we go! Come on, push!
Give me one big push!
Come on, here we go! Come on!
I'm sorry. It's stillborn.
Get some fluid in her.
How we doing? Everything all right?
We lost the Roberts' baby.
- God. How?
- Respiratory failure.
Umbilical asphyxia.
Where did you take the baby?
I saw you take Melanie's baby outside.
I took the baby for an autopsy.
I didn't want the other mothers to see.
I baptize thee... in the name of the Father... and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.
I got you.
Yes.
Let us pray.
Heavenly Father, we thank you that by the water of the Holy Spirit... you have bestowed upon your servants, the forgiveness of sin... and have raised them to the new life of grace.
"Sustain them, O Lord, in your Holy Spirit.
"Give them an inquiring and discerning heart...
"...the courage to will and to persevere...
"...the spirit to know and to love you...
"...and the gift of wonder and joy in all your work. Amen."
Amen.
Good girl.
That's a good girl.
Note how the section of hair is flat on one side then arced on the other...
- ...like a capital "D."
- Right.
The texture is... I don't know.
It's unusually soft.
What did you think when you looked at her nails?
Narrower than normal.
Any results yet from the DNA testing?
Common genetic characteristics.
Almost as if they are siblings from the same parent.
It's way too early to have anything conclusive.
Baby.
What are you doing?
You can spell your name.
How can you spell your name?
How can Mommy's... smart little boy spell his name?
Sweetie, was the soup too hot?
Okay, baby.
We're going to go see our friend Mara.
Barbara?
Are you crazy?
Honey, can't you tell me what happened?
Don't!
No! God, no!
I understand there are recent developments at Midwich.
Yes.
The children are beginning to interact more with the general community.
There have been casualties...
I should say accidents, suicides... that might be related to contact with the children.
But no direct physical violence was involved.
I have also been trying unsuccessfully to get Dr. Chaffee back on the program.
His daughter's the leader, isn't she?
He's probably got his hands full.
Personal considerations aren't important, are they?
I think that the opportunity to study these children should take precedent... over any considerations.
Let's cut to the chase here.
It's now of interest to national security that we continue... to carefully monitor their developing powers.
I ask for another year's grant.
Good afternoon, children.
Why do you smile?
You're trying to hide your thoughts from us.
Just how deeply do you see?
Everything active in your mind.
But the process that leads to the spoken words eludes us.
Why do you speak some thoughts and not others?
Wouldn't it be a noisy world if we said everything we thought?
Okay, I'm going to put a drop of this in your eyes; it won't hurt.
I'm sorry. Calm down!
I'm going to wash your eye out!
Okay, open your eyes! It's all right!
It's okay!
How's the doctor?
Corneal scarring.
Most likely permanent blindness.
How did it happen?
Doesn't remember much.
It will be listed as an accident.
It was the children.
There's no proof of that.
What I want to know is... are the people in this town safe?
- What are they going to do to us?
- Alan.
- Hi.
- This has got to stop.
They don't belong in regular classes.
It's getting dangerous, the other children can't learn.
I was thinking maybe you could teach them.
They seem to respect you.
Respect?
No. They don't even know the meaning of that word.
Why bother? It doesn't make any difference what we do.
We need you.
What am I going to teach them?
What am I possibly going to teach them?
Humanity.
Humanity.
Hello, sweetheart.
Come on.
There's no need for you to become emotional.
I'm old enough to do things by myself.
Do you want to talk about what happened at the clinic today?
Why should I be experiencing emotion at this moment?
What is that word you're thinking?
What is "empathy"?
So if I have felt pain...
I should be able to identify with others who feel pain.
Yes.
Good night.
What's the matter?
You want some?
I'm sorry.
I just can't hack it.
"God said...
"...Let us make man in our image...
"...after our likeness."
But "image" does not mean outer image... or every statue or photograph would be man.
It means the inner image.
The spirit, the soul.
So we gather here today... to remember the inner beauty... of one who lost her hold.
Melanie Roberts... somehow lost that image of herself as a creature... made in God's bountiful spirit.
But what of those in our midst... who do not have individual souls... or spirits?
They have one mind... that they share between them.
One spirit.
And they have the look of man.
But not the nature of mankind.
What are you doing here?
Looking for the baby.
The one who was born with us.
The one who died.
How do you know about that?
The baby's not here.
She was taken away.
Where?
I don't know.
Do you have a memory of the baby?
But it bothers you.
It hurts to lose a loved one.
She was to be with me.
We were to be together.
How do you know that?
You've lost someone too.
I think I can teach them.
Anyway, I'll try.
I never told David about the Roberts' baby.
Right.
And then he said,
"she was to be with me"?
What did that mean?
I don't know.
Are they paired up... like a mate?
What can I teach such bright young students?
What about human physiology?
That's at least something
I know a little bit about.
For example, does anybody here know how the eye works?
Do you mean how do we see, or...
Well, what else can the eye do?
- The eyes are...
- The eyes are the windows of the soul.
Yes.
That's right. I see that you've been reading proverbs.
I was speaking to Robert.
The eyes are the windows of the soul.
All right, if you'd rather talk about philosophy instead of...
- ...physiology, let's talk about the soul.
- Alan.
Sorry.
Can you come to my office for a minute, please?
Yes. I'll be right there.
While I'm away, why don't you each take out a volume of the encyclopedia... and try to learn a little something about our culture.
I know your game.
I know what you're up to.
Ever since you got here,
I've been watching.
Watching people leave this town.
Watching things die.
You aren't right. None of you.
And one of these days, somebody's going to do something about it.
I don't like the way you're looking at me, boy.
I got a gun, too, and I'm not the only one.
One day somebody's going to get up on a rooftop... and start picking you little bastards off.
One by one by one.
Aren't you going to do something?
Aren't you going to bawl like all the other little pissants?
Well, do something, damn it!
There are going to be changes.
God help us.
The children did it.
I know they did it.
And my daughter was involved.
Now, who are they?
It was their communal consciousness...
Some abrupt evolutionary jump.
It was their communal consciousness... but I couldn't explain the blackout.
Or the mass pregnancies.
Midwich isn't the only colony of such children.
In a township in northern Australia,
30 infants were born in a single day.
They all died within ten hours of birth.
In an Inuit community near Anchorage, a group of 10 children were born.
There were 20 births in a small village near the Turkish-Iranian border.
Each location was remote... isolated, and each had a blackout the same as Midwich.
And how long have you known about this?
The way I see it, there are three possibilities.
Number one: parthenogenesis.
The development of a fetus without fertilization.
I know. I don't buy that, either.
Two: we do know the CIA slipped doses of LSD to men without them knowing it... in order to study the effects of psychotropes on gene structure.
Maybe the government engineered the blackout... then artificially inseminated your women with super sperm.
First they knocked them out, then they knocked them up.
And what's the third possibility?
Xenogenesis. Implantation.
The production of an offspring unlike that of the parent.
Or should I say host?
Come back to the project.
Not just a matter of protecting your daughter. As you can see, it goes... far, far beyond that.
You have to put this in the back of your mind.
Don't think about it when near them.
- Don't ever let them know that you know.
- Why didn't you tell us?
- I mean, why didn't you warn us?
- Because I couldn't.
Well, I couldn't.
If anybody else knew, the children would know.
Look, I have spent years of my life building a wall around this.
Hiding it, so they couldn't read what was in my mind.
But as their powers grow stronger, they keep looking deeper and deeper.
I need your help.
Would you please just... come back to the project.
We've made our decision.
Discussion will not change our plans.
We will live in the abandoned barn outside of town.
You will bring us supplies.
You can't stop us, you know.
Don't try.
You've been discussing us with Dr. Vurner.
What did she tell you?
You are hiding something.
I'm not letting you go.
- You haven't been given an option.
- Have you?
You know, you don't always have to do everything they tell you.
We are the same.
You're not.
You're David. You're different.
I've come to get Julie.
Have you seen her?
Is she at the barn?
Fine.
Are you all right?
I'm sorry.
You're okay, aren't you?
Julie doesn't want to come with you.
Damn it, I don't care what Julie wants.
Her mother's frantic.
I'm bringing her home.
Some kind of big accident,
Doc, out by the barn.
Alan, wait!
I was just told that the other towns with blackout children were destroyed.
- What? All of them?
- Everyone in them, the adults and children.
They couldn't evacuate without the children knowing.
- The governments gave no warning.
- God. What about Midwich?
I've been told to pack and get out.
I'm leaving tonight. Do the same.
Get out while you can.
Another man is dead.
Why do you hate us so much, Mara?
It isn't a matter of hate.
It is a biological obligation.
You are thinking of what happened to the others.
Then our actions shouldn't surprise you.
We have to survive no matter what the cost.
We are the only ones left now.
I don't see why we can't reach an understanding.
Why can't we just live together?
If we coexist, we shall dominate you.
That is inevitable.
Eventually you will try to eliminate us.
We are all creatures of the life-force.
Now it has set us at one another to see who will survive.
- That's a cruel sport.
- Life is cruelty.
We all feed on each other, exploit each other in some way to survive.
I don't agree with you.
I think that adaptation is the key to survival.
Cooperation and symbiosis... and compassion.
Why do you think your own survival depends upon emotion from us?
Should we pity you?
- Empathize with your plight?
- You should feel!
You should feel something!
Without feelings, you're nothing.
You're just second-rate mimics of a higher organism.
That's right, a higher organism.
We're your superiors in our capacity to love.
Without compassion, you're a doomed species.
Emotion is irrelevant.
It is not our nature.
I'm not so sure you're right about that.
Still, you are aware of the other colonies.
So you must be, in some basic sense... aware of who... what we are.
Yes.
So the question becomes... should you be allowed to live?
You're suddenly thinking of an ocean.
You're blocking your thoughts rather effectively with this image.
We must leave here, spread out, disperse.
Soon we will have reached a stage where we can form new colonies.
You will arrange a method of getting us away from here.
What if I refuse you?
You are a prisoner of your values... and you won't be able to deceive us.
You know that.
Don't you?
Father?
Yes.
Yes, I know that.
Make your arrangements.
We must leave tonight.
You're thinking of the one who died.
She was to be my partner.
Yes, it's true.
Without a mate, you are of less importance to us.
And your development of emotions is disturbing.
We can't leave you behind.
It is time we resolved this.
Hurry up!
"Begone, everyone who is proud, and bring him low...
"...and tread down the wicked where they stand!"
- This is the last of it.
- All right, get going.
"Bind their faces in the world below.
"Then will I also acknowledge to you...
"...that your own right hand can give you victory!"
I'm glad you're here.
I wanted to talk to you.
I really think that I can help you.
You've got to stop! Please stop!
You got to stop! Sarah, please!
"Hast thou eyes of flesh?
"Dost thou see as man sees?"
A state of emergency has been declared.
Please return to your homes... and remain there until further notice.
- Come here! Grab my hand, quick!
- Come on!
People will be arrested.
This is a state of emergency.
Please be home.
The children murdered Sarah.
Susan too. I just found her at the clinic.
The police are on their way to the barn.
They're going after the children.
We've got to stop them.
- You can't go. You'll get hurt.
- We've got to try!
No. The state police can't do anything to stop the children. It'll be a bloodbath.
Now, listen to me. Listen to me.
There's another way.
Now, look, something happened today.
I was able to block Mara from reading my thoughts.
- How?
- I suddenly thought of the ocean.
I suddenly saw the view in front of our house.
You know how Barbara and I used to dream our dreams there?
We used to stand on the cliff and... right in front of us was something so much more powerful than we'll ever be.
That image came to me. That image came to me, and they couldn't see past it.
I know I can do that again.
I can build a wall.
I can build a wall and deceive them.
What are you going to do?
The only thing that we can do.
No.
Not David!
He's not one of them! No!
Multiple suspects. Possible 417.
All units respond and echo your 10-4.
41-A.
41-A, do you copy?
Echo, 41-A. Do you copy?
We're in position. Send them in.
Roger, this is 2-A. I copy.
241 in progress. Stand by.
What are you waiting for?
You got your orders.
Get out!
- More death.
- Survival.
Tell us what arrangements you have made for us.
Well, I haven't had much time.
It is 11:22.
What are you anxious about?
The arrangements.
Yes. Actually, I...
I left my notebook out in the car.
I wonder if somebody could go out and... get my notebook from the front seat of my car.
No.
I am unable to see what you're thinking.
Well, I'm... just wondering who's going to go out and get the notebook from my car.
- David.
- No.
You are successfully blocking your thoughts.
You are thinking... of a brick wall.
Why do you keep looking at the clock?
Come on.
- We're going now.
- Mother, no.
Take your place.
Stop it! Leave her alone!
Take him!
Go now! Go!
Don't worry.
We'll go someplace where nobody knows who we are.
Timms, they've got to understand.
My treatments are making him smarter... at an incredible rate.
It's more important than training him for war.
You know our funding comes from The Shop.
They want this animal trained in virtual reality... to use the infrared battle helmet, not recite the ABCs.
I won't increase the dosage of aggression drugs.
He's already been exhibiting behavioral instability... in the virtual battle simulations.
What you're suggesting could destroy his mind.
There is no choice, Larry.
They don't care about his intelligence enhancement.
They want his primal rage centers fully stimulated.
He is to be battlefield ready.
Fucking screw the political assholes.
He's the best chimp
I've ever had.
Battlefield simulation engaged.
Primate response optimum.
Threat.
Kill complete.
Let's go check out sector 10.
OK, level two.
Threat.
Targeting.
Acquire.
Acquire.
Acquire.
Attack.
Kill complete.
Evasive.
Security breach inside Sector 14, Level 5.
14, Level 5.
Threat.
Evasive.
Threat.
Clear.
Check the upper building.
Go! Go!
Get over there.
Get over there on the double.
Evasive.
Non-threat.
Exit clear.
We have no visual indication... that any incoming artillery have arrived... or, indeed, are on the way.
We can report the air raid sirens are going off.
The military has been silent, though a couple of hours ago... we heard a huge noise... and it was confirmed that four KC-1...
KC-135 supertankers had left the area.
These are the planes that refuel... other fighter planes and bombers...
American bomber planes over the area... so they're in the air.
I'm trying to sleep, Larry.
I had a bad nightmare.
Really bad.
God, I hate it when you smoke in bed.
Oh, Jesus.
What did you do that for?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Larry, what are you doing?
Answer the phone.
Yeah? Hello?
Larry, it's Timms.
Your chimp's dead.
It tried to escape.
When?
It wasn't a robot we were building, Timms.
It was a living organism.
As the project supervisor and the government liaison... it was my responsibility... to use the strongest measures available.
Listen, I've warned you about the aggression factors.
He just ran the program we embedded.
Five years of research down the drain.
We'll get you another chimp.
That chimp was the key to moving on to a human subject.
Come in.
We'll talk about it.
I've had it.
I want to make something better than a military weapon.
I'll just find funding in the private sector, that's all.
You're not thinking straight, Larry.
You signed ironclad nondisclosures.
VSI owns it all.
Besides, it might not be the healthiest thing to try.
You're talking about The Shop?
The puppet masters who pull all the strings?
What, they own me?
They'll rub me out...
The Shop... if I don't comply?
You're being paranoid.
Your intelligence enhancement work was brilliant.
No one's saying stop.
I am.
Larry, relax.
I know you're upset because of what happened with the chimp.
Relax? They want to suppress my work!
The potentials for human advancement are endless!
Virtual reality holds a key to the evolution of the mind... and that's my focus.
This is something... and we haven't had something for a while.
There will be time for all this, Larry.
You just have to play the game a little longer.
That is how everything finally gets done in this world.
Why don't you take a hiatus and we'll restructure around here?
You can use the rest.
Take a hiatus.
Another hot one.
It's going to be a killer.
It's a long way up here.
Jobe!
Jobe, lad!
Ah, Jobe!
I feel like you live in the top of a tree.
Come on, boy. Let's go.
Grass is waiting for you.
Oh, no.
Did me brother have you doing penance all night again?
What did you do?
Nothing.
OK, well...
It's OK, Jobe boy.
It's OK. It's me, Terry.
Come on. Here.
Go get a shirt on, then we'll go, OK?
What have we got here?
Well...
Oh, no.
Oh, my God, would you look at this?
You finished Big Red.
Yeah.
Aye, you're magic with a machine, boy.
Look at this.
Could we try it... try it today, Terry?
I don't see why not.
Go fill up the gas can, Jobe.
Get me a candy bar.
Hey, Pop, could you move that shit before Christmas?
Fill her up.
Hey, Jake, that's dangerous.
You forget who you're talking to, half-wit?
That's dangerous.
Jobe, boy, go ahead and finish what you're doing.
He's smoking, Terry.
That's right. I'm smoking.
Why don't you shut the fuck up and fill your gas tank?
Jake, he don't mean no harm.
One of these fucking...
Jake, how's your old man doing?
Worse than ever!
Angelo is like all brilliant types... erratic.
But we tolerate them at The Shop as long as they perform... and Angelo has certainly done that.
Project Five is very impressive.
Mr. Director, without Angelo, there is no Project Five.
Well, he'll be back... one way... or another.
Falling.
Rapid descent.
Flying.
God damn it, Caroline.
Never unplug a program when I'm engaged.
You just ruined the whole effect.
Falling, floating, and flying?
So, what's next, fucking?
What are you pissed off about?
You said you were going to take me to the city... but as usual you're hooked up into that machine.
Well, why didn't you remind me?
I did.
Oh, babe, I'm sorry.
Oh, Caroline.
I'm sorry.
This is not a good time for me right now.
I'm really sorry.
Get ready.
We can still get a hotel.
We don't need to go anywhere.
I'm ready right now.
Larry, I want to go.
I don't feel like being around people right now.
I don't feel like going to the city.
You never want to go anywhere.
Caroline... I need your support.
I'm going through a lot of changes right now.
Well, I'm going through a lot of changes, too.
You're too obsessed with your work to even notice.
I'm young, Larry, OK?
And I'm not going to become a recluse just for you.
I'm into reality reality, not this artificial reality.
This technology is going to change the world.
This is the future... and you're afraid of it.
Yeah, well, it may be the future to you, Larry... but it's the same old shit to me.
I give up.
Hey, Jobe!
Hi, Peter!
You've finished Big Red.
Hi, Jobe.
Hi, Mrs. Parkette.
Come over and have some Kool-Aid with Peter when you're done.
Thanks, Mom!
Peter, look what I got you.
The Nuke Masters special edition!
Yeah. It's 3-D, too.
But where are the glasses?
Glasses?
That's OK. I've got a pair of my own anyway.
Look at the blades, man.
If you boys listen real careful, you can hear the panpipes... of the little people in the grass there.
Right, Terry.
I hear them all the time.
Hi, Dr. Angelo.
Can we play
Cyber-Boogie today?
Yeah, sure.
That would be fine.
Damn.
Peter!
Get your ass over here!
I got to go.
Hi, Dad.
I told you not to leave that fucking bike in my way!
Didn't I?
Sorry, Dad.
What is wrong with you?
Didn't I tell you not to play with that moron anymore?
You want to get stupid?
Get in the house.
I'm tired of this shit.
Come on.
That boy was told to take care of this.
He constantly shirks his duties.
Can't have these godless little creatures at the altar.
It's sacrilege!
Where are you, boy?
You're never here where you should be.
Four times in as many weeks... he's forgotten his duty to the parish!
He brings the wrath of the Lord on himself... just like his namesake.
Jobe, are you in there?
Answer me, boy!
God saw fit to make you a ward of this church... and you must earn your keep.
I've tried to teach that stupid mind responsibility... since you were five years old.
Which of God's lessons helps you to remember best, Jobe?
I'll remember my chores,
Father, I promise!
Journal entry, May 1.
Work, marriage, life... what a joke.
I'm going now, Larry.
My plane leaves in an hour.
It's better for both of us this way.
Drinking all that whiskey isn't going to help your depression.
It's probably going to make it worse.
Yes, you're right, Caroline.
It is probably going to make it worse.
Well, don't blame me.
You have no idea of what
I'm going through, do you?
My work is falling apart, and you decide to leave me.
It's dead for both of us, so why don't you give it up?
Good-bye, Larry.
Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.
Mother of God, pray for us sinners... now and at the hour of our death. Amen.
Big Red.
Booting audio journal.
May 10 entry.
Recording.
Oh, Jesus... this hiatus is driving me insane.
When I think of what
I might have accomplished... with a human subject.
I've got to find a way to continue the work on my own.
There's so much to do.
I can't wait any longer.
Full.
Hi, Jobe.
Hi, Dr. Angelo.
How are you?
Looks like you're working hard.
Yeah. I'm a real hard worker.
Jobe, do you like to play games?
Yeah. Peter says you have the best games.
I have a game in my house that you might like to play.
Would you like that?
OK.
Remember, one of the
4 shapes on the bottom row...
You see them down there?
Matches one of the shapes on the top row.
So put your finger on here... and move that shape to the question mark, all right?
Incorrect.
Try again.
OK, here we go.
There.
There.
Incorrect.
Don't worry.
Take your time. Here we go.
Correct answer.
You did it. Very good.
Let's play another game.
Come here, Peter. Come here!
I'm going to get you, Peter.
All right.
Look at that!
Let's go.
Watch out! Holy moley!
Come on, Peter. Slow down.
I'm going to hit the wall.
I'm getting dizzy.
Peter, wait!
Come on, Peter. Come on back.
Peter, I'm getting scared.
Game over.
Why don't you go upstairs and get some drinks?
Hey, Jobe. It's OK.
It's just a game.
I was really bad.
Well, you'll get used to games.
Thanks, Peter.
Hey, Jobe.
Hey.
I was flying upside-down,
Dr. Angelo.
Come on. Hop up.
Come over here.
Sit down.
You know, Jobe...
I have other... different games.
I even have one that could help make you smarter.
I was born dumb.
But... you would like to be smarter, wouldn't you?
I don't know.
Well, if you were smarter, people wouldn't be able to... take advantage of you.
Do you understand what I mean, Jobe?
- Yeah.
- And?
Sometimes they do.
They do.
Can you keep a secret?
Well...
I'll tell you one.
I can make you smarter... but only if you want.
And you must never tell anyone.
You mean a secret for just you and me two?
That's right.
Well, I bet you already know, don't you?
So don't you tell anybody, OK?
OK?
Well, you're as healthy as a mule.
When can we play the games?
Soon, Jobe.
I need to give you a shot of vitamins first.
I had a shot once,
Dr. Angelo, and it hurt.
This won't.
Trust me.
I'm very good at this.
That looks like a gun.
OK, just relax your arm.
Relax your arm. Relax.
Look over there.
Look over there.
It didn't hurt.
Just relax.
Your head's going to be a blank for a while.
All right?
Yeah.
Just breathe now.
Too dark.
No, it's not going to be in a while.
Just breathe and relax.
That's it.
In a while, it's going to be like... being up there with the stars, Jobe.
Like going to another planet.
You're going to feel a tingling sensation in your hands... but don't panic.
It's OK.
I'm right here with you.
It's all part of the game.
OK, here we go.
Cortex stimulation engaged.
Brain stem strobe enabled.
Is that my hand?
It's going to hit me!
No, it's not going to hit you.
Just relax. Just breathe.
Strobe velocity increasing.
Journal entry, May 10.
The electrochemistry of his brain... has responded better than I'd expected.
I'm going to step up the virtual treatments... and increase the dosage of nootropic drugs.
I should see escalations in his brain patterns... by the end of the week.
It's too late to turn back now.
Jobe, what's the matter?
I'm hungry.
Well, go eat.
His mind is like a clean, hungry sponge.
Synaptic activity has increased
400% in less than a month.
His human brain is responding to the nootropics... and virtual stimulation more rapidly than my animal subjects.
Go on! Go faster, Peter!
Go on!
I can catch you right now!
Come on and get me, Peter!
Come on!
I'm going to get you now!
You better not get too excited
'cause I'm getting you!
Look right there!
Come on!
I got you!
Game over.
Yes! You nailed it, Jobe!
You nailed it!
Whoa, that was sketched.
Finally some real competition.
Yeah, he got you that time, didn't he, Peter?
Congratulations.
You just graduated to the next level, Jobe.
Hi.
You got a horse?
What are you doing?
Why are you standing there half-naked, exposing yourself?
What sort of perverted behavior is this?
You should knock before you come into somebody's house.
This is my house.
I pay the rent, and
I want to cash my checks now... because I want to buy some new clothes.
And I'm going to buy some cowboy boots... and I'm going to make this place a ranch.
It's that Dr. Angelo, isn't it?
He's been feeding the Devil in your head!
No, he hasn't!
I'll see to that.
You know, you shouldn't hit people.
You shouldn't hit people like that.
Very impressive.
Did you use the Project 5 formulas on this subject?
As a base.
But I've totally reconfigured... both the nootropic and the cyberlearning programs... without aggression factors.
Of course.
That only makes sense.
I can't believe you went ahead and did this, Larry.
Look at the comparisons.
It works with a human subject, Timms.
It's incredible work, Larry.
So... what do you say?
I've gone as far as I can in my lab at home.
I need access to the main lab to go further.
There's no telling how far I can take Jobe.
I can't do this without your help.
What's it going to be,
Ms. Burke?
Would you check my fluids, Jake?
Do I know you?
I mow your lawn.
No. You're not the Lawnmower Man.
Well... wow.
You've certainly changed.
I don't know how you did it, but I approve.
Ms. Burke, I filled her up with trans fluid.
No charge.
Thanks, Jake.
You're welcome.
Well, I'm looking forward to having my lawn mowed... soon.
She's got the hots for you, Jobe boy.
You got to be kidding me.
She's just teasing this half-wit.
Look at him. You got him dressed up like a fool.
I've known her ever since her husband died.
She's been kicking up her heels with all the young studs.
And I tell you, she wants this young fella.
Don't you call her no whore around me, old man.
Whores do it for money.
She's got money. She's young.
She does it 'cause she likes it.
I told you to shut up.
Hey, Jake, don't do that.
OK, Lawnmower Man.
Dr. Angelo, I think people can tell that... that I'm changing.
Just don't draw attention to yourself, OK?
Just keep doing the lawn job for now.
It's not going to last forever.
I like doing the lawns.
That's good.
I always liked doing them.
That's good.
You're cleared. Go ahead.
Why is this place so far from town?
The work here at VSI is government classified.
Top Secret.
Good afternoon, Dr. Angelo.
Looks like a dungeon in here, Dr. Angelo.
You see this, Jobe?
Holy moley!
Come on. It's OK.
Look.
This is some of the most advanced computer equipment... in the world, Jobe.
In these gyrospheres, we wear full cybersuits... which allow us to enter into virtual reality and move.
Your entire nervous system and endocrine system... will be in sync with the brain expansion.
Endocrine?
Endocrine: it carries secretions of certain glands... like the thyroid, adrenal, and pituitary... which regulate growth.
Sometimes...
I think I've discovered a new planet... but one I'm inventing instead of discovering.
I've just sighted the shore of one of its continents.
Booting biology systems readouts.
Bio-monitors on.
Choice.
Graph 5... engage.
Change brain wave parameters.
Brain wave pattern altered.
Prepare brain stem injection.
Initiate brain stem.
Insertion complete.
Let me off! Dr. Angelo!
Synaptic reaction positive.
My head, Dr. Angelo!
I like it!
Change brain wave parameters.
Initiate second level.
Insertion complete.
Lemonade.
Think he likes lemonade?
It's so hot today, Jobe.
Why don't you come up for a cold glass of lemonade?
Oh, Jesus, Mother of God, would you look at that?
Go on, you dolt!
Go on!
Jobe, have you ever kissed a girl before?
Really?
Give me your tongue.
Give me your tongue.
Soft.
Hard.
He absorbed Latin yesterday in less than two hours.
It took me a year just to learn the Latin alphabet.
God damn,
Larry, I am speechless.
I think it's time we brought this out of the closet... and report these results directly... to the Department of Scientific
Intelligence in Washington.
DSI is bound to offer you both tits.
The timing isn't right.
There's some factors that need ironing out.
Iron them out.
I'm not going to be able to keep this quiet much longer.
The historical perspective of expressionism, as typified by
Van Gogh and Gauguin...
Rhythm and blues. You like it?
Yeah, sure.
I like it.
Classical.
You should try listening to a whole tune once.
You might like it.
Too much to hear.
I get it all by sampling segments, anyway.
Who taught you how to drive?
Me!
There you go. Enjoy yourselves.
Jim, you need anything else?
Hi, Dolly!
Hi, Jobe.
I'll be right with you.
Don't you want to check out the comics first?
I gave them up, Peter.
No way!
Matter of fact, I got my whole collection in that crate... and I'm giving it to you.
Whoa, awesome! Dudical!
Order me fries and a Coke, all right?
Are you all right?
I don't got time for this.
I hope he doesn't puke on the counter.
What's wrong with that fool?
He's probably been taking dope.
Look at that guy!
Weirdo.
Whatever the hell's his problem?
Probably dancing with the booze lady.
He's having a breakdown.
Oh, man!
Are you all right, Jobe?
Peter, I got to go.
The things that people think.
I had to use all my concentration to block it.
I don't want it to happen again... because if it does,
I think I would go crazy.
It's amazing.
Even with the treatments stopped... your abilities continue to change and grow.
I speculated that if psychic powers existed... this research would be the key to unlocking them.
But this is beyond anything I ever expected.
I mean, like the accelerated learning.
The results are completely unexpected.
Completely.
Well... don't worry, Jobe.
I'll sort something out.
I've got to keep this psychic development quiet... especially from Timms.
Who's Timms?
I'm preparing Angelo to present his results to you personally... as you've requested.
He's met with incredible success.
Precisely why we feel it's time for you to guide his efforts... in a specific direction.
Which direction is that?
We're most anxious to see what effect... the original Project 5 formulas will have... on this subject.
Mr. Director, the aggression vectors in Project 5 caused...
That was an ape, Timms.
We want to know what effect it will have on a human subject.
It's an essential step for us to determine... certain covert sector applications for Angelo's work.
It will be difficult in the extreme... to convince Angelo to reinstate the original formulas.
Then you'll have to be persuasive in the extreme.
Run batch 505.
Program change initiated.
Initiate brain stem.
Brain wave pattern altered.
Can you hear me, Jobe?
Relax.
Shut down theta stimulation.
I'm coming over. Stay there.
Warning. Endocrine, adrenal, increasing to fatal levels.
System shutdown.
I saw God!
I touched God!
I was pushing.
I didn't even think of Jobe's safety.
That amount of brain swelling should have killed him.
Instead, it completely disappeared, leaving no lesions.
Somehow the experiment is out of my control.
I'm stopping the treatments... until I can figure out what went wrong.
Confessions.
Eavesdrop on real people... telling their innermost secrets, darkest desires.
I saw this woman today.
I couldn't help myself.
God, he smells good.
I want to get him up for something strange tonight.
I can read your mind.
Oh, right.
You sure have some strange fantasies.
Come with me.
Let's live a little...
Jobe, it's so huge in here.
This will be the best ride of your life, Marnie.
You're the best ride of my life.
In here we can be anything we want to be.
I'll see you on the inside.
Wow! It's my hands!
Look at this!
Oh, my God!
Jobe, where are you?
I'm right here, Marnie.
Come over here.
You're beautiful.
I'm stuck.
I'm stuck in this stuff, Jobe.
It's from our primal mind.
I don't like it, so let me up.
Jobe, let me up!
Now!
Nothing can hurt us in here.
Jobe, you're scaring me.
I want out!
I know what you really want.
Watch this.
Oh, my God! What are you doing?
Jobe, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Oh, my God, let me up!
Oh, God!
Warning: brain pattern abnormal.
Automatic system shutdown.
Marnie, are you OK?
Marnie, I couldn't stop.
Dr. Angelo said nothing could happen.
I didn't mean to hurt you!
What did Dr. Angelo do to me?
I have to find out.
I can't fly to fucking
Washington tomorrow!
I told you...
I have to resolve some problems before presenting my work.
This is premature.
I'm not ready.
You're ready enough.
Oh, shit.
Be reasonable.
I can't keep this secret any longer.
We can't cut ourselves off from the hand that feeds us.
I thought you were doing lawns today.
I wish I were.
Mind over matter, Dr. Angelo.
Not a miracle.
A fact.
I have to run some tests.
Get a clearer picture.
This is all so new.
It's not new.
I realize that nothing we've been doing is new.
We haven't been tapping into new areas of the brain.
We've just been awakening the most ancient.
This technology is simply a route to powers... that conjurers and alchemists used centuries ago.
The human race lost that knowledge... and now I'm reclaiming it through virtual reality.
You're moving too fast.
Even with all these new abilities, there are dangers.
Man may evolve a thousandfold through this technology... but the rush must be tempered with wisdom.
You're trying to get inside my head, Jobe.
I can feel you pushing.
You realize, Dr. Angelo... that my intelligence has surpassed yours... and I can't allow your fear of what you don't understand... to get in the way of this work.
The treatments have to continue.
We have no choice.
I was terrified of him.
I'm sure he knew it.
He surpassed me, all right.
But his insights seem... twisted.
I fear for Jobe's sanity.
This Washington trip couldn't come at a worse time.
So as you can see, the results with this one human subject... indicate unlimited applications for mental disability alone... such as retardation,
Alzheimer's.
And the possibilities for education are staggering.
With the proper funding, we could perfect this... within the year.
Right.
Any questions?
The Director wants to know... if you've noticed any significant changes... since the Project 5 formula was reinstated.
We only reinstated those formulas a few days ago.
Not enough time for any findings.
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about?
I was going to speak with you about this after the meeting.
The Shop requested that we resume... the original Batch 5 with Jobe.
You idiot.
You goddamn idiot!
Do you know what you have done?
There is no telling what the Project 5 abstract... will do to a human being.
Do you understand me?
What Project 5 will do to a human... is exactly what we want to find out.
You know what it did to Roscoe 1138... and he was the most advanced chimp we ever had!
Before that, there were two other chimps... who got into fits of rage so severe... they tore each other apart!
That's it, isn't it?
It's always like that with you guys.
It only leads to one thing: war.
Why didn't you include the development... of Jobe's other abilities in your report, Larry?
Don't look so shocked.
You may have tried to hide it... but I have witnessed what your new formulas, not Batch Five... have done to your human subject.
I've had enough.
Make sure he goes back to the hotel.
What other abilities?
Your behavior cost us a lot of ground tonight.
I had to talk for hours to repair the damage.
My behavior?
You fucking sycophant.
You've been lying to me all along.
For security reasons.
Piss off!
Look, without The Shop's financial involvement... this project wouldn't exist.
Then maybe it shouldn't.
I hate to be the one to break it to you, Larry... but the concept of dirty money went out... when the Catholic Church got into banking 300 years ago.
It's all dirty money.
For Christ's sake, don't let some juvenile ethics problem... get in your way.
Your research is too important.
You'll be more realistic in a few days.
They're going to pick up
Jobe and bring him here.
The Director wants a personal demonstration... of his... progress.
They're not going to get Jobe.
There's no walking away, Larry.
All right. Let's get him.
Yes, sir.
Shit.
They're here to pick me up as well. Right, Timms?
You can't leave!
You're integral to the project!
Oh, shit!
Go check the other wing.
You forgot your messages.
No, it's too much!
I'm Shop, Dr. Angelo.
You're going to have to come with me.
Oh, excuse me.
Here. Here, take that.
What do I do with this?
Cover him.
Devil in your head.
Who you talking to, half-wit?
Which of God's lessons...
I told you not to play with that moron.
Devil in your head.
Shit!
There's no need to panic, Timms.
We know where he's going.
We'll send a grab team in tomorrow... and pick them both up at once.
I want you to get back there.
Cancel Angelo's clearance at VSI.
We don't want him stealing his work, now, do we?
I'll let you know what the next step is... after we've had a chance to examine Jobe Smith.
Give me strength, that I might prepare the way... for those who will follow.
Who's there?
Hail, Mary, full of grace...
Who is it?
Who's there?
The church is closed for the night.
Come back tomorrow.
I'll hear your confession.
I've come for your confession.
I don't want you here tonight, Jobe.
Leave me alone. Get out.
The good Father McKeen.
Took in the poor idiot nobody wanted.
What have you done?
The Devil's taken you.
Judgment Day is here!
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
They're impatient for you.
I have unclean thoughts, but deliver me.
In hell!
I've used thy name in profane fantasies.
I have committed cruel acts of molestation.
Be done!
What are you doing here?
What, you going to do some night mowing?
You're a strange motherfucker... and I am too tired for this,
Lawnmower Man.
So why don't you take your silly ass... and go trick-or-treating or something?
Shit!
Fuck!
Get away!
Don't hurt me.
Please.
Lawnmower Man's in your head now, Jake.
There's no escape, ever.
Stop taking his side, Carla!
You're treating him like a little girl!
Damn!
I'm so sorry, Peter.
Why is Dad getting so bad?
I don't know, baby.
He's sick.
Damn kid's toys. lf, in fact, that occurs, it would mean... he is one of the select few... who has been in every Wrestlemania... all seven of them.
Talk about talented!
How long would Bobby last south of the border?
What's that noise?
Help me!
You are going to die!
Hold on.
All right. Come on through.
Hell of a thing.
Hello, Lieutenant.
I'm Dr. Angelo.
I live next door.
What's happened here?
Thanks for coming over.
You saved us a trip.
We're just taking statements from all the neighbors... just to see if they saw or heard anything unusual.
There's a little boy.
His name is Peter.
Has anything happened to him?
Oh, no, he's fine.
It's just his dad...
Excuse me, Lieutenant.
Where's the rest of him?
Birdbath.
Did you say the birdbath?
Birdbath.
Lieutenant, the wife and the kid... they're getting ready to go down to the station.
Said they slept through the whole thing.
Didn't hear or see anything.
Didn't hear anything.
The lab boys tell me that somebody chased Parkette... through the house with a power lawnmower.
I would have thought that would have made some racket.
Crazy with the heat.
Schiz-o-fucking-phrenia... all over town last night.
What else happened last night?
Well, somebody torched poor old Father McKeen... with a flame-thrower or something.
Must have been a Satan cult or something.
Either that or that weird human spontaneous combustion thing.
That really happens sometimes.
Hell of a thing.
My God.
That's not all.
Marnie Burke was found wandering around stark naked... laughing her ass off, flipped out.
The psychiatrist figured she'd probably witnessed... one of the murders, and she's just in shock... but I've seen people flipped out before... and this girl is flipped out for good.
I don't believe she'll ever stop laughing.
Two bizarre murders in one night.
This world is chock-full of nuts, Cooley.
Don't forget that.
Weirdos, schizos, bozos.
Well, accidents happen.
That's all there is to it.
Two bizarre accidents in one night.
Accidents?
You were just calling them murders.
We'll just file a routine report.
Just clean and tidy.
Oh, Peter, come here.
Come here.
It's OK, son. It's OK.
How did this happen?
Jesus Christ.
Jobe, come on.
I gave myself a boost, Doctor.
Virtual reality is not just a simulation.
It's a whole other world... a new electric dimension.
Utopia, Doctor.
The utopia that men have dreamed of for a thousand years... and I'll be the conduit.
You want to create monsters.
You killed two people, Jobe.
Why?
You've got to let me help you.
Help me?
I'm going to help you,
Dr. Angelo.
I'm going to help all of you... cleanse this diseased planet.
This technology has peeled back a layer... to reveal another universe.
Virtual reality will grow... just as the telegraph grew to the telephone.
As the radio to the TV.
It will be everywhere.
You're having delusions, Jobe.
Struggle for reason.
I'm going back to VSI... to complete the final stage of my evolution.
I'm going to project myself into the main frame computer.
I'll become pure energy.
Once I've entered in the neural net... my birth cry will be the sound... of every phone on this planet ringing in unison.
Listen to what you're saying.
The first sign of psychosis is a Christ complex.
Cyberchrist.
Please listen to me, Jobe.
The Project 5 abstracts that you were exposed to... were never meant for the human mind.
You've had a psychotic break.
Let me try to reverse that.
What are you blocking?
You can't hide anything from me, Dr. Angelo.
So The Shop is coming to pick me up... and you've betrayed me, haven't you?
I'd like to proceed to Angelo's residence, sir.
Very well. Leave the van's cameras on transmit.
I want to monitor from here.
Yes, sir.
Now you can witness the impossible, Dr. Angelo.
Let me pull the curtain back so you can watch.
We'll check the house.
What the hell...
I'm going back to VSI now... and once I'm inside the main frame...
I'll have access to over
5,000 other databases.
And from those 5,000...
I can reach out again and again and again... eventually inhabiting the entire planetary network.
By the year 2001... there won't be a person on this planet... who isn't hooked into it and hooked into me.
I'm sorry you hate what you have created.
Right, Jobe.
I'll be right there.
Dr. Angelo has been working on something else... behind our backs.
He's developed a fantastic new energy weapon.
I've observed a demonstration.
It's very advanced.
I want you to gather his research... all disks, hard copies, everything.
Erase the files from the main frame there... then transport it all here personally.
I can't believe it.
Not Angelo.
Not a weapon.
He is totally opposed...
Believe it, Timms.
He took out two of my men in a way I've never seen before.
I sure have been missing you, Jobe.
Peter, where are you going?
I want you to come right back.
Jobe, wait up!
I told him to come down here and pick me up after work.
What's going on here?
What the fuck?
What did you open the gate for?
We didn't.
Some kind of malfunction.
That's it.
The back. That's it.
Can you do it?
Did the same guy that killed my dad get to you?
Yes, Peter.
I'll explain it all later.
Go upstairs and tell your mother to call the police.
Don't worry.
Go on quickly, go.
Erasing 261Y8K.
Confirm erase?
There's a little problem at the main gate.
It opened by itself, and it won't close.
Send everything you've got down to the main gate.
Right.
Now!
Welcome to VSI main frame.
Please enter pass code.
Analyzing.
Pass code cleared.
You have access to the network node.
File 15 blocked.
What's happening?
Someone's hacking the main frame from the outside.
They're in, and they're running a computer virus... that's placing triple key encryption codes... on all outside access and network connections.
What the fuck does that mean?
We're being cut off.
The main frame will be totally isolated... in less than two minutes.
Off the net.
Something's wrong.
I can't even get an operator.
Explosives.
Come on.
You hear something?
What?
It sounds weird.
Fuck you!
Holy shit!
I have to go now, Terry.
Well, OK, Jobe.
What are you doing here?
Leave me alone.
I'll wait for you down the road.
I want you out of here as fast as you can.
But I want to go with you to find Jobe.
I understand, Peter... but I want you to stay with your mother, OK?
Peter, get in the car.
Larry, be careful.
We'll wait here, OK?
I'm in.
I'm in.
System overload.
Automatic shutdown inoperative.
Oh, my God, Jobe.
I can't believe this.
Outside terminal activity control.
Now to get out of here.
Simple combination.
Oh, Jobe, what's happened?
He really did it.
Denied?
Denied!
I must find a way out.
I can't believe this!
I must find a way out!
I can't let you do it, Jobe!
You!
Yes, me.
You did this!
You cut the network connections, but I'll find a way out.
All this power... isn't meant to be in the hands of one person.
You're wrong.
You need to be led, just like everyone else.
It's a basic need.
This technology is meant to expand human communication... but you're not even human anymore.
What you've become terrifies me.
You're a freak!
Your naive idiocy makes me very angry!
Human!
This universe is mine.
I am God here.
I sense your thoughts.
What are you hiding?
The bombs.
Jesus, the bombs.
Bombs?
You forced me to.
So you were willing to die?
I'll stop them.
You can't defuse the bombs, can you?
You lost all your power over the physical world... once you transferred in here.
Stop!
So you've given me one final game to play.
I find a way out, or I die in this diseased main frame.
But that's not my destiny.
I have things to do, people to see... a billion calls to make.
You will die in the explosion.
You're trapped.
You're trapped in here, aren't you?
You're trapped right here.
Peter is here.
Jobe, he's in here.
He's going to die.
Jobe, please.
Please, Jobe!
Don't sacrifice Peter.
You and I have been responsible... for so much destruction.
What's happening?
I don't want more death.
Go. Save him.
Jobe, come back with me.
Hurry!
Go!
Access denied.
Help! I'm lost!
Somebody!
We've got to get out of here!
The whole building's going to blow up!
The door's locked!
It won't open!
Open.
Run, run!
Access denied.
Get down, Peter! Quick!
Get down!
There's got to be one.
Let me in!
Come on, Peter, quick!
Peter, come on.
Where is it?
Access denied.
Maintenance line access granted.
A back door.
Get out of here! Go now!
July 10.
Last journal entry for a while.
I won't let Jobe's death be for nothing.
What happened to him is my responsibility.
For some reason, I've been given a second chance... so I'm taking my work underground.
I can't let it fall into the wrong hands again.
If we can somehow embrace our wisdom... instead of ignorance... this technology will free the mind of man... not enslave it.
We're ready.
Good.
They'll be here soon.
OK. Let's go.
Oh, see you in the choir on Sunday!
Hi, Mike.
Hello?
Hi.
Oh, hi.
Been home long?
No. I just got back from the store.
We're looking forward
to tonight.
Can I bring anything?
I think I have everything.
Well, if there's
anything...
Wait.
There is something.
Do you have any champagne glasses?
I thought we'd start with champagne.
We have some.
Do you have eight?
No. We have six.
Bring them. Mitch and I will drink from jelly glasses.
You're going
to such trouble.
I always go to lots of trouble for a dinner party.
I've got to run.
See you around 8:00. Bye.
Bye.
Look at this floor.
I thought you love chocolate chip cookies.
Where's that book
I gave you?
When I was a little girl, this was my favorite book.
Which one was your favorite story?
What difference does it make?
Let me out of here! Help!
It's been so long,
I almost can't remember them.
Help! Let me out!
What are you doing?
Just preheating to 350.
Help! Help! There's a crazy woman here!
She's going to cook me!
She's going to eat me! Help!
I never could do long division.
Let's see.
How many times does 12 go into 75?
Oh... 6 times,
3 left over.
Why?
Well, at 12 minutes a pound, that means you have to be in the oven by no later than...
Oh... but evisceration takes at least an hour.
Evisceration?
What's that?
It's like gutting a fish.
First you make a long slit, then remove everything that isn't meat... the heart, the lungs, the intestines, and so forth.
Then you fill it back up with stuffing, sew it back together with one of these.
Maybe I should get started now.
Wait. There's plenty of time.
This was your favorite book.
Don't you want to hear a story?
A love story?
Yeah!
Well, not really.
But it's a really good one.
You'll like it a lot.
Here.
It's about these guys in college.
They live in the same dorm.
And one of them's kind of poor, so he works his way through school selling things.
Hey!
Be careful with that.
His name's Bellingham,
and he collects antiques.
Well, one day,
Bellingham got
a very special delivery.
Meanwhile, the other guys...
Andy and Lee...
they were real rich.
And they did something
very nasty to Bellingham.
Lee, the most work you've done in four years of college is filling out that application for the Penrose Fellowship.
Hey... hard work pays off,
Andy, especially when you have a girlfriend who can write award-winning essays about why I want to spend the summer traveling Europe.
I suppose my sister's pretty smart.
She's just not very honest.
I don't see why you'd risk it.
If they learn she wrote the proposal for you, they'll kick you out.
Your family sends you to Europe every summer anyway, so I don't understand.
Ah.
But this way I have the fellowship money to bring back a Maserati.
Maserati.
Guess who was my main competitor for the Penrose.
You know Bellingham works part-time at the university museum.
Where Susan does volunteer work. I know.
You better hope he doesn't find out she helped you screw him out of that fellowship.
Bellingham has the hots for Susan.
Don't worry.
We'll be fine.
Ah, Andy.
Ah, Edward.
How you doing?
You going to introduce me to your friend?
Uh, yeah.
This is...
Lee... Monckton, right?
Yeah.
Yeah. I, uh, saw your picture in our illustrious college newspaper.
Congratulations.
Oh... thank you.
It's an odd coincidence, us meeting, since we're in competition for the Penrose
Fellowship.
Oh, wait, wait.
You said it.
Competition.
Somebody... has to win, you know.
Not always the better man.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Allow me.
Hey, thanks.
That lot 249 was a heavy mother.
You'll get your money back tomorrow.
Oh, there's no rush.
Uh...
I'll tell you what,
Edward.
Just show us what you have in there, and my friend here will write it off.
All right.
If lot 249 lives up to my expectations, it won't matter that I was cheated out of the Penrose.
Cheated?
Something unfortunate happened to me before the committee announced its decision.
What?
I was accused of stealing a pre-Columbian Zuni fetish from the museum.
Well... did you?
I loathe Zuni aesthetics.
But by the time
I was cleared, the committee decided in your favor.
Oh.
Well, who was it that accused you?
It was an anonymous tip.
Oh!
I should probably get going.
Susan's waiting at home for me.
Absolutely not.
You're not leaving here until you see what's inside lot 249.
That was the deal.
Edward, why would you buy something like this?
I wasn't born with a silver trust fund in my mouth.
You... You can actually sell this to somebody... for a profit?
What else would I sell it for?
Give me a hand.
My...
God, Andy, it looks just like your father.
Ew!
It stinks like rotten flowers.
Let's see if the embalmers did him any justice.
You're going to unwrap it?
Why not?
All you're looking at is 3,000 years of dry rot.
I'm going to be late.
I'm going to...
I'll show you out.
See you later, Andy?
Yeah.
4, 5, over.
6. Two more.
You're back early.
We quit after two sets.
Sounds like we lost to Andy again.
Do you know what your brother is doing right now as we speak?
Huh?
He's unwrapping a mummy!
With Edward Fucking Bellingham!
How much did you tell Andy?
Uh... that... that... that you wrote the essay.
Oh.
Well, that's okay.
He knows I do all your papers anyway.
Oh, and then... and then,
Bellingham casually mentioned that someone dropped an anonymous tip about the stolen...
Pre-Columbian
Zuni fetish?
He's guessing.
Well, maybe, but I think
Andy knows it was you.
Andy's my brother.
He won't do anything.
And Bellingham's a loser.
He can't do anything.
I've really got to get ready for dinner.
Don't you want to see his face?
No. Thank you.
He looks pissed off.
Like he's thinking.
He's not thinking anything.
The first thing the embalmers did was stick a hook up his nose, then drag his brain out through his nostrils.
Here's where they cut him open to remove his innards.
Then they stuff him with flowers and spices.
Here, hold this open.
Come on, hold this open.
Ohh.
Myrrh.
Cassia.
Onions.
And...
What?
Onions and what?
A fortune cookie.
What does it say?
Uh...
I have no idea.
Do you know how to read
Third Kingdom hieroglyphics?
You're taking those books back to the library now?
They're three months overdue.
And I thought I'd stop by to see Andy on the way home.
You don't care about those books or Andy.
You're going to go see Bellingham.
I give him a hard-on.
I'll talk to him, throw him off the track.
Zuni fetish.
Hmm.
They use their second timeout.
I've never
seen Johnny
so enraged by
a defensive play.
He's arguing at
the scorer's table.
They call a technical
on Scott!
"Grow, o light.
"Come forth, o light.
"Rise, o light.
" Ascend, o light.
"O darkness, remove thyself from before him.
"Open his eyes.
That bastard can read that scroll.
"Open, tat.
"Open, nap.
"Open his eyes.
"O darkness, remove thyself from before him.
"Open his eyes.
"The eater of shadows,
"the eater of souls,
"open his eyes.
"Open, tat.
"Open, nap.
Open his eyes."
Oh, jeez!
Hey, Bellingham!
Hey, Bellingham, come on.
The fuse box is right outside your door.
Christ.
Come on, Bellingham.
It's the end of the playoffs.
I mean, Christ.
Oh.
God.
Hey.
You okay?
Yeah.
Jesus!
What the hell are you doing here?
I just... I just thought I'd stop by.
What's going on?
Somebody just knocked me down.
Look, you two just wait here.
Don't go after him!
Go after who?
Um... a thief.
Damn fuses.
Well... he couldn't have taken much.
Would you like some brandy?
Thank you.
Did you see him?
No.
Not really, but he did look a little weird.
Yes, he was very weird.
He must've been on drugs.
Got off with my rings.
Roman stuff.
Hollow gold.
At least he didn't get away with lot 249.
No!
No!
No!
No!
Lee!
Lee!
#...With me #
# That's the way
a heart breaks #
# And every man
must pay the price #
# That's the way
a heart breaks #
# You stand before the gates
of paradise #
# Of fire
and ice ##
Shit.
This better be important.
Need any help, Bill?
No. It's a mess, but we got it covered.
Andy.
You busy?
Guess I could use this, huh?
I lied to the police.
I saw who did it.
What?
I saw who killed Lee.
He was thin... and filthy... and stinking.
Like rotten flowers.
Lot 249.
Very few thieves would have the discernment to realize that this was one of the museum's most unusual pieces.
Susan Smith stole that fetish and planted it here.
Oh, my.
What a sensual candlestick.
Take your hands off that.
Good evening,
Mr. Smith.
Dean Murray.
Andy, do you know Dr. Carey, the curator of the university museum?
Uh... hi.
What's going on,
Edward?
I'm a little busy right now, Andy.
Yes.
Mr. Bellingham is packing.
He's leaving the university.
Oh!
Pity.
Would have been a nice acquisition if the mummy had come with it.
What happened to the mummy?
He never did have taste.
I don't care how cheap the psychology is.
I still hate these stupid chrysanthemums.
I'm aware of that, operator.
I've been trying to get through for a half hour.
Help!
Police!
Please, somebody help me!
Susan!
Susan!
Jesus.
Jesus.
Damned fuses.
Hey!
Oh, you're awake.
That's my master's thesis.
What are you doing?
Well, I'm going to start a little fire under your chair and roast your nuts.
Why?
Because you killed my sister and my best friend.
That's why.
I didn't kill them.
Right. Right.
Your friend lot 249 did.
Ah. I thought he'd be back.
The alleged perpetrator's got an airtight alibi.
He's been dead for 3,000 years.
Then these should make for excellent kindling.
Oh, Andy, you're crazy.
Ooh, damn, I think
I forgot my matches.
Grow, grow, o light.
Ascend, o light.
Rise, o light.
Come forth, o light.
O darkness, remove, re...
Shit, how does it go?
Remove thyself from them.
Open, tat. Open, nap.
Open his eyes.
Open his eyes.
Open...
Edward,
I believe in being prepared.
Eh?
Batteries in case those fuses blow again.
Need a hand up there, fella? Huh?
Jesus.
Edward...
I'm not going to apologize for what Lee and Susan did to you.
I won't call the cops either, because what sane person would believe that a 3,000-year-old mummy really did come back to life anyway?
But I do have another idea.
Well, that takes care of that, doesn't it?
Would you untie me, please?
Yeah, of course.
As soon as you tell me where the scroll is.
You don't need the scroll.
It only worked for that mummy, which you've totally destroyed.
The second drawer in the desk on the right.
It's irreplaceable.
Yeah,
I certainly hope so.
That scroll would have made my entire career.
My sister and my best friend died because of this.
Killing me won't bring them back.
If I let you live, that will bring them back?
Don't worry, Andy.
You'll never see me again.
But I'll find a way to keep in touch.
Open, tat.
Open, nap.
Bind them both to my service and to the gods of death, terror... and revenge.
Ha ha ha!
Hey, man, what's so fucking funny?
I was just thinking of this guy I know.
Couldn't distinguish a Third Dynasty sacred scroll from a piece of post-Alexandrian pictogram porn.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Mom, I'll be home as soon as finals are over.
Yeah, the funeral was hard on me, too.
No, the police don't have any leads yet.
All right?
I'll see you next week.
Bye.
Andy?
Bellingham sends his regards.
Antiques are so fascinating.
You told that very well.
Thank you.
Goodness, it's almost 1:00.
We've got to get things started.
You know, if I'm not home by 6:00, they'll come looking.
Looking for what, dear?
Uh... wait.
I'll tell you another story.
Put the book away.
But it's the best story yet.
I stopped reading twice because I got scared.
It's about the old man who's so rich and lives in this big house all by himself.
Okay. This'll be the last story, and you have to make it quick.
I will. I promise.
It's about this old man named Drogan.
Old man Drogan had this big problem, so he hired this man to help him,
a very
professional man.
It's already taken care of, pal.
Here,
Mr. Halston.
Here!
You are Mr. Halston, aren't you?
That's me.
Tell the driver to wait.
The man says you should wait.
For what this guy's paying,
I ain't going nowhere.
Take your time.
In here,
Mr. Halston.
In here.
I want you to make a hit.
That is what you do,
I understand.
How did you get my name?
A Mr. Saul Loggia told me that you know him.
Who do you want hit?
Your victim is right behind you.
I ought to kill you for that.
I don't like jokes.
I don't make jokes.
Sit down.
Here.
Sit down,
Mr. Halston, and look in that envelope.
There will be another 50,000 when you bring me proof that the cat has ended its time on earth.
I don't believe this.
You're hiring me to kill a cat?
That cat has killed three people in this household.
That leaves me.
I need not explain anything, but I will.
In fact, I feel the need to justify myself so you won't think me mad.
This is quite a mansion, don't you think,
Mr. Halston?
Quite a mansion.
Help me up.
Over the years lfilled this place with everything, everything you could want, everything you could ever want.
There used to be four of us living here...
myself
and Carolyn Broadmoor,
the only friend
of my sister Amanda.
And Richard Gage,
a hired man
with the family
almost 20 years.
We were
a dull collection
of rich, old,
unhappy people.
Then...
the cat came.
It was Gage
who saw it first.
He tried repeatedly
to scare it away,
but every time
he drove it off,
it kept coming back.
Finally,
my sister Amanda
noticed the animal.
She's the one
who took it in.
Oh, the poor little thing.
It's starving.
Is Oo hungry, darling?
Is Oo hungry?
Cats aggravate emphysema, Carolyn.
Get rid of the filthy thing.
Cats aggravate my brother, Carolyn.
Don't pay any attention.
I want it out of here!
Either out of here or dead!
Which is it to be?
Don't you ever dare to hurt this cat!
You hate cats.
You always have.
You're wrong.
I don't hate cats.
Cats hate me.
Don't you see?
We're all in danger while this animal's here!
You'll find out!
You'll find out!
You'll...
You all right?
I'll be fine.
I'll be fine.
You know who I am, don't you?
That is, where my money comes from?
Drogan Pharmaceuticals.
One of the biggest drug companies in America, Mr. Halston.
And the cornerstone of our financial success has always been this.
Tri-Dormal-Phenobarbin, compound "G."
Good old Tri-Dormal-G.
A combination painkiller, tranquilizer... and mild hallucinogen.
Remarkably helpful to those of us fighting the debilitating effects of an aging heart.
It's also remarkably expensive.
It's also remarkably habit-forming.
I've read all about it, Drogan.
That stuff is one step up from street junk.
You've obviously done very well with it.
And you've done well yourself.
Saul Loggia knows of at least two dozen jobs you have done for various members of the professional community.
All right.
We each know who it is we're dealing with.
Tell me the rest of the story about that cat.
Ah, yes.
The cat killed them.
I warned them, but they wouldn't listen.
They found out.
They found out.
My sister
was the first to die.
It was midnight.
She was on her way
to the kitchen
to get that evil beast
some food.
We heard her scream.
Amanda?
Amanda?
What happened, Amanda?
Death by accident,
the coroner said.
But I knew.
Why didn't you get rid of the cat then?
I tried,
Mr. Halston.
I tried.
I'll kill it!
Let me have it!
I'll kill it!
Carolyn locked
the damn thing
in her room.
She became obsessed
with the animal.
I'm going to kill it!
Do you hear me?
I'll kill it!
I'll kill, kill, kill!
My mother told me
that cats like to get babies
and old people
when they're asleep
and steal their breath.
Carolyn died at midnight as well.
Suffocated in her bed.
The coroner said natural causes in her case, but again,
I knew.
What did you do then?
I told Gage to get rid of the vile thing.
It took him almost 24 hours to find the cat and capture it.
Without concern for the time,
I sent him out to Milford to the veterinarian... to have the beast put away once and for all.
I phoned ahead to the vet.
"Mr. Drogan," he said,
"it's midnight."
A week later, the day Dick Gage was buried, the cat came back.
No one actually witnessed any of these deaths.
What makes you think this cat had anything to do with it?
I'm sure it killed them.
It killed them all.
And I'm next!
I'm afraid of it,
Halston.
It skulks around in the shadows, watching me.
It's waiting.
It's torturing me by waiting.
It's been sent to punish me.
I don't get it.
Tri-Dormal-G.
That's what it's about.
It's a synthetic, developed in our laboratories in New Jersey.
Our testing of Tri-Dormal-G was confined almost solely to cats because of the unique quality of the feline nervous system.
How many did you eliminate?
Over four years of testing...
5,000 cats.
5,000 of your buddies get wasted, and they send you back to settle the score with Drogan here, is that the deal, pussycat?
Don't make light of it, Halston.
I warn you.
I never make light of any matter involving $ 100,000.
Then you'll take the job?
I could do it now if you want me to.
I could put my hands around its neck and snap it.
Son of a bitch!
It's not going to be that easy, Mr. Halston.
Don't worry, Drogan.
I'll kill your cat for you.
Good. Kill it, bury it and bring me its tail so I can throw it in the fire and watch it burn.
I'm going into the city.
That's why I made the taxi wait.
There's food, there's liquor, there's everything.
Everything you could want.
Everything you could ever want.
Okay, cat.
It's just you and me now.
Jesus Christ.
Crazy old fucker.
Crazy old rich fucker.
How about it, kitty cat?
"Everything you could ever want."
Why is it rich guys always buy the cheap stuff?
Look at this shit.
Hey, cat!
For me, it's nothing but the best.
All the time.
"Everything you could ever want."
Shit.
Hey, you little motherfucker!
Nobody hits me twice!
No fucking body hits me twice!
Can't get hot.
Can't let yourself get hot, ever.
You make mistakes when you're hot.
What is this?
What is this shit?
Oh, no!
No!
This is a $ 100 shirt.
You'll be sorry you messed with me, you little shit.
I got a reason to kill you now.
Drogan, you cheap bastard.
Come on, kitty cat.
Let's be friends again.
We can go over by the fire like before.
You can sit on my lap again, and I'll give you a nice boost.
This is the real stuff, kitty cat.
Not like that cheap crap
Drogan sells.
What do you say?
You're beating me, pal.
You're beating me good.
I'm trying too hard.
Hey, cat...
I've never blown a hit yet.
It's just a matter of time.
Get away!
Get off of me!
You're done for, you fuck.
The rest of your nine lives are going in one lump sum.
I can outwait you, you little shit.
I've never blown a hit yet, kitty cat.
This is the end of you.
That's impossible.
Fucking impossible!
I had a dead bead on you.
Where are you?
You son of a bitch,
I know you're in here.
Oh, no.
No.
My goodness, that was a scary story.
But my favorites were the love stories.
Uh, yeah. There's one story in that book that's really scary.
But it's a love story, too.
Really?
Yeah.
Which one was that?
The one that's in New York.
You still have to cook for quite a while, but I'd love to hear the story.
"There's a part of New York that's busy during the day,
"but late at night when hardly anyone is around,
"strange things
sometimes happen.
"10 years ago,
on a cold, dreary night,
"an artist named Preston
saw something
very, very strange."
Oh, yes. Wyatt.
Hello.
Preston, it's Jer.
There's a guy here...
Fortyish, anal retentive type, right?
On the money.
Tell him I've been waiting half an hour.
He's been waiting half an hour.
Another Drambuie on the rocks, please.
This one's on him.
Keep it.
Wyatt, I'm sorry.
I was just working on a new piece.
Ah, come here.
Hey, Jer.
Give me a Holsten.
So, did you bring me a check or just a lot of cash?
Thanks, Jer.
Judith says she hasn't moved anything of yours in four months.
Judith Amato.
Big gallery on West Broadway.
If it isn't out by tomorrow, it gets junked.
What? Wyatt, you've got to convince her that l...
I can't convince her of anything.
Wyatt, you're my agent.
Well, not exactly.
Preston, your artistic vision is just not a marketable commodity.
Wyatt, I'm broke.
I can't live on nothing.
And I can't live on 10% of nothing.
You're a monster.
I'm an agent.
For an agent, being a monster is just credentials.
I'm sorry, Preston.
Fuck you!
Jesus, what am I supposed to do now?
Ah, Jesus.
There's Van Gogh.
Degas. Rodin.
They didn't have agents.
How'd they get so successful?
They died.
Time to put it to bed,
Preston.
All right.
What about Maddox?
Let him out in the morning.
That's probably how I'll end up.
Oh, jeez.
You're pissed out of your mind.
Ooh.
I'll take you home.
All right.
Why didn't you do that inside?
I did. It just goes right through.
Oh, my God!
Jer.
Help me.
Help me!
Jesus.
Maddox!
Maddox, open the door!
Help! Maddox, open the door!
Please! Aah!
Please! Please don't!
Your life in exchange for a promise.
You got it.
If I let you go, you must swear you'll never say you saw me.
Never say you heard me speak.
Never tell anyone how I look.
Never repeat what I've said.
A promise forever.
You got to be kidding.
I... I... promise!
Cross your heart?
Ugh.
I promise!
Come here.
No! Oh, God!
Shh! Shut up.
Please be quiet.
Please be quiet.
Shh.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Just be quiet, all right?
All right?
I won't hurt you.
Let go of me!
What are you trying to do?
Take a taxi.
You don't see any taxis out here, do you?
If you want one, you can use the phone from my place.
Look, my name is Preston.
I live just around the corner.
Come on.
Come on.
I thought someone was following me back there.
That wasn't me.
Here we are.
What are you doing down here?
I was supposed to meet some friends, but I got lost.
Here you go.
So what were you doing out this late?
I was having an argument.
My agent dumped me tonight.
Police, 16th Precinct.
Hello?
Uh...
Anyone there?
Jerk.
The line's busy.
We'll try again in a minute.
By the way... what's your name?
Carola.
Carola.
Can I have something to drink?
Sure.
So where are you from, anyway?
Colorado.
Sort of.
I had a boyfriend in California.
But... it didn't work out, so I left.
You're the first real artist
I've ever met.
Tell that to my agent.
Did he do that?
I had a run-in with a bottle of scotch.
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
I'm sorry.
Say, did you try that taxi again?
Maybe you should wait till morning.
Good morning.
Last night was very important to me.
It was a nightmare.
Oh, no, Carola!
Not you!
It was everything else until I ran into you.
That part was good.
It was very good.
I needed it.
I need more of it.
I do, too.
Right now.
Oh, yes.
Help me!
Oh, look.
I have to go out for a while.
Wait for me.
Hey, that's my friend!
That's my friend!
I want to go!
Someone cut off his head!
Carola?
Carola?
Yeah. I would've left, too.
Help me!
Yeah.
It's Carola.
Can I come up?
Sure.
Jesus.
I know what you're thinking, but the girl I'm staying with, her boyfriend...
I didn't ask any questions.
I called a friend of mine...
She's a friend of a friend.
She owns a gallery on Houston Street.
That's
House-ton Street.
I told her how wonderful
I thought your work was, so she'd like to come see it.
Does she have a name?
Victorine... but I don't remember the rest.
Roget?
Victorine Roget?
A friend of a friend?
Jesus.
I hope you don't mind.
Victorine Roget... owns the hottest gallery downtown.
Of course
I don't mind!
It's what
I've always wanted.
So how does it feel to be a huge success?
Victorine just sold a piece to a couple for $23,000.
You're a smash.
Well?
Damn.
What?
Preston.
Excuse me.
Hey, Maddox.
Nice work.
Thanks.
I haven't seen you around, pal.
Not since the night Jer died.
I'm Carola.
Nice to meet you.
Who's Jer?
The bartender at this bar...
He died.
In the alley out back.
Come on. Let's go.
Hey, you know something, don't you?
Just sober up, Maddox, before someone puts a match to your breath.
Preston.
I told the cops everything I knew, which is exactly nothing.
Come on.
Promise forever.
So are you sorry you met me?
You take care of me.
Maybe just a little bit...
I take care of you.
Will you take care of me... and my child?
Your child?
Oh, so...
We going to make this little bastard legitimate?
To put it another way... will you marry me?
Will you marry me like this?
Oh, ho ho!
Yes, baby!
No! I'm pregnant!
Come here, sweetie!
No, no, please!
Where are the scissors... scissors?
Mom, look what Wyatt bought for me!
They took our picture a million times.
These kids ran me ragged.
Each has the metabolism of a hummingbird.
Ooh, is there some party tonight that I'm missing?
Yes. Preston and I are celebrating the 10th anniversary of the night we first met.
When you thought he was going to rape you?
Yes, darling.
It's also the night that Wyatt here gave your father the shaft.
I had to murder three other agents before you'd let me represent him again.
And you're still on probation, you mercenary wretch.
Find another agent that'll baby-sit the spawn of hell on a Saturday night.
Wyatt!
Choose your weapon.
10 years.
So many things have changed.
Changed for the better, I hope.
The night I met you,
I almost died.
What do you mean?
Well, let's just say it was the night my life started over again.
So, happy anniversary.
You know, you saved Preston from people like me.
She saved me from myself.
Time to go.
Sincerity is bad for my self-image.
Good night, Wyatt.
Good night,
Wyatt.
Whoa, taxi!
Taxi!
Let's move to the country.
We'll buy a big house with lots of land for the kids.
They'd hate it as much as you would.
Then for you.
There's nothing you could give me that I don't already have.
Yes, there is.
Oh, Christ,
I hate this neighborhood.
Can't get a cab here ever.
No one has ever seen this.
That's what killed Jer.
Then it turned on me.
I knew
I was going to die, but it spoke. It spoke.
It told me it wouldn't kill me if I promised never to tell anybody what I'd seen.
So I never told anybody.
Then why are you telling me?
Because you're the most important thing in my life.
You've brought me
10 years of happiness,
10 years of success,
10 years of a perfect life.
I'm telling you because I love you.
You deserve everything
I can give you, and I've never given you the truth about what happened the night we met.
What's wrong?
I'm not making this up.
I'm telling you the truth.
You promised you'd never tell!
Ohh!
Oh, God.
You broke your promise, you idiot!
I loved you!
Ugh!
Jesus, please...
Carola, stop it!
Just change back.
I can't.
No.
No!
What's wrong with the kids?
Stop it!
It's too late.
You betrayed your vow.
It can't be!
No!
I'm so sorry.
Carola...
I loved you.
And I loved you, too, but you broke your vow, and that sealed our destiny.
Yo!
Raarrr!
What the hell was that?
I don't want to know.
My goodness, you really did keep the best one for last.
No. I saved the really, really best one for now.
You should have told me the really, really best story before,
'cause now it's too late.
It's the best one because there's a happy ending, a really happy ending.
The stories in that book don't have happy endings.
But you got to hear this story.
This kid, his name's Timmy...
That's nice, dear.
And Timmy's older brother had this paper route.
One day, when
Timmy's brother got sick,
Timmy had to go collecting.
Timmy went to this one house, and this lady at the door said, "Come in."
He went inside, and she threw him into a pantry.
She made him eat cookies to get fat
'cause she was going to kill him and eat him!
This is your story, and we both know how it comes out.
But you don't. Something really weird happens.
Oh, really?
Yeah. Uh, Timmy had these marbles in his pocket, and they were all shiny and slippery.
When he threw them on the floor... she didn't see where they went... and she slipped!
Timmy saw his chance to escape... if he could just reach the keys!
Don't you just love happy endings?
So you want me to tell you the story of my life.
Like I said, that's what I do.
I interview people.
I'm a collector of lives.
FM radio, KFRC.
You'll need a lot of tape for my story.
No problem. I got a bag full of tape.
You followed me here, didn't you?
Yeah, I suppose I did.
You seemed very interesting.
This is where you live?
No.
It's just a room.
What do you say we get started?
What do you do?
I'm a vampire.
I haven't heard that before.
You mean this literally, I take it?
Absolutely.
I was waiting for you in that alley.
Watching you watching me.
And then you began to speak.
What a lucky break for me.
Perhaps lucky for both of us.
You said you were...
...waiting for me.
What were you going to do?
Kill me, drink my blood?
Yes.
But you needn't be concerned now.
You really believe this, don't you, that you're a vampire?
We can't begin this way.
Let me turn on the light.
- I thought vampires didn't like light.
- We love it.
I only wanted to prepare you.
Christ!
Don't be frightened.
I want this opportunity.
How the hell did you do that?
The same as you do.
A series of simple gestures.
Only I moved too fast for you to see.
I'm flesh and blood...
...but not human.
I haven't been human for 200 years.
Please...
How can I put you at ease?
Shall we begin like "David Copperfield"?
"I am born...
"...I grew up."
Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it.
That's where we should start, don't you think?
You're not lying, are you?
Why should I lie?
1791 was the year it happened.
I was 24.
Younger than you are now.
But times were different then.
I was a man at that age.
The master of a large plantation, just south of New Orleans.
I had lost my wife in childbirth.
She and the infant had been buried less than half a year.
I would've been happy to join them.
I couldn't bear the pain of their loss.
I longed to be released from it.
I wanted to lose it all:
My wealth...
... my estate...
... my sanity.
How many aces are in a deck?
Are you calling me a cheat?
No, I'm calling you a piece of stinking offal!
You lack the courage of your convictions.
Do it!
Most of all, I longed for death.
I know that now.
I invited it.
A release from the pain of living.
My invitation was open to anyone.
To the whore at my side.
To the pimp that followed.
But it was a vampire that accepted.
Give me your money or you die!
Do you still want death?
Or have you tasted it enough?
Enough.
He left me there, on the banks of the Mississippi...
... somewhere between life and death.
Who are you?
What're you doing in my house?
I've come to answer your prayers.
Life has no meaning anymore... does it?
The wine has no taste.
The food sickens you.
There seems no reason for any of it... does there?
What if I could give it back to you?
Pluck out the pain...
...and give you another life?
One you could never imagine.
And it would be... for all time.
And sickness...
...and death...
...could never touch you again.
Don't be afraid.
I'm going to give you the choice...
...l...
...never had.
That morning, I was not yet a vampire...
... and I saw my last sunrise.
I remember it completely...
... and yet I can't recall any sunrise before it.
I watched the whole magnificence of the dawn for the last time...
... as if it were the first.
And then I said farewell to sunlight...
... and set out to become...
... what I became.
Have you said your good-byes to the light?
I've drained you...
...to the point of death.
If I leave you here...
...you'll die.
Or...
...you can be young always, my friend...
...as we are now.
But you must tell me...
...will you come...
...or no?
Yes.
Yes.
Your body's dying.
Pay no attention.
It happens to us all.
Now look...
...with your vampire eyes.
What did you see?
No words can describe it.
Might as well ask Heaven what it sees.
No human can know.
The statue seemed to move, but didn't.
The world had changed, yet stayed the same.
I was a newborn vampire, weeping at the beauty of the night.
Perhaps you'd like another cigarette?
I would. It's not bothering you, is it?
I don't assume it would.
It's not like you'll die from cancer.
I don't think so.
- What about crucifixes?
- Crucifixes?
Can you look at them?
Actually, I'm quite fond of looking at crucifixes.
And the stake through the heart?
Nonsense.
And coffins?
Coffins.
Coffins, unfortunately, are a necessity.
Don't worry.
Soon...
...you'll be sleeping as soundly as you've ever slept.
And when you awake...
...l'll be waiting for you...
...and so will all the world.
Blood, I was to find, was a necessity as well.
I awoke the next evening with a hunger I had never felt.
Once you taste this...
...you'll never go to another tavern again.
You think so?
But what if I'd rather taste your lips?
My lips are even sweeter still.
My friend...
...should taste those lips.
Is his...
...kiss...
...as deep...
...as yours?
Deeper, ma chérie.
I will not take her life.
I've done it for you.
She's dead...
...as a doornail, my friend.
It's so easy, you almost feel sorry for them.
You'll get used to killing.
Just forget about that mortal coil.
You'll become accustomed to it, all too quickly.
Are you not hungry?
Au contraire, ma chérie.
He could eat the whole colony.
I will finish it.
Now leave us.
Can't you pretend, you fool?
Don't give the game away.
We're lucky to have such a home.
Pretend to drink, at least.
Such fine crystal shouldn't go to waste.
I know.
It gets cold so quickly.
We can live like this?
On animal blood?
I wouldn't call it living. Call it surviving.
Useful trick if you're on a ship for a month.
There's nothing in the world now that doesn't hold some...
Fascination.
Yes.
- I'm bored with this prattle.
- We can live without killing.
It's possible.
Anything is possible.
But just try it for a week.
Come into New Orleans and let me show you some real sport.
Lestat killed two, sometimes three a night.
A fresh young girl...
... was his favorite for the first of the evening.
For seconds, he preferred a gilded, beautiful youth.
But the snob in him loved to hunt in society.
The blood of the aristocrat thrilled him best of all.
The trick is not to think about it.
You see that one?
Widow St. Clair.
She had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband.
How do you know?
Read her thoughts.
Read her thoughts.
I can't.
The "dark gift" is different for each of us.
But one thing is true of everyone.
We grow stronger as we go along.
Just take my word for it.
She blamed a slave for his murder.
Imagine what they did to him.
Evil-doers are easier, and they taste better.
Where are we going?
Nowhere.
Now, young man, you really amaze me!
I'm old enough to be your grandmother.
Oh, yes, that's the melody.
I remember it.
Murderer!
My little papillons!
My butterflies, he killed them!
You... whining coward of a vampire...
...who prowls killing rats and poodles!
You could've finished us!
You've condemned me to Hell!
I don't know any Hell.
That's more like it!
Anger! Fury!
That's why I chose you!
But you can't kill me, Louis.
Feed...
...on what you will.
Rats, chickens...
...poodles.
I'll leave you to it...
...and watch you come around.
Remember:
Life without me...
...would be even more...
...unbearable.
Consider yourself lucky.
In Paris, a vampire must be clever for many reasons.
Paris?
Here all one needs is a pair of fangs.
You came from Paris?
As did the one who made me.
Tell me about him.
You must've learned something from him.
I learned absolutely nothing.
I wasn't given a choice, remember?
You must know something about the meaning of it all.
Why? Why should I know these things?
Do you know them?
That noise...
...it's driving me mad!
We've been here for weeks with nothing but that noise!
They know about us.
They watch us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.
Come...
...to New Orleans then.
The Paris Opera's in town.
We can try some French...
...cuisine.
Forgive me if I have a lingering respect for life.
You'll soon run out of chickens, Louis.
Monsieur Louis?
You don't want any supper?
No, ma chérie.
We're worried about you, Master.
When is it that you go riding in the field?
And how long since you've been to the slave quarter?
Everywhere there is death.
Are you still our master at all?
That will be all, Yvette.
I will not go unless you listen to me.
You must send away this friend of yours.
The slaves are all frightened of him...
...and they are frightened of you.
I'm frightened of myself.
Hear me now!
This place is cursed!
Damned!
And, yes, your master is the Devil!
Get out while you can! You're all free!
Do you hear me?
Run!
Run!
Save yourselves!
Perfect! Perfect!
Just burn the place!
Burn everything we own!
Have us living in a field, like cattle!
You thought you could have it all.
Shut up, Louis!
Come on!
Where are we?
Where do you think, my idiot friend?
We're in a nice, filthy cemetery.
Are you happy?
Is this fitting? Proper enough?
We belong in Hell.
What if there is no Hell?
Or they don't want us there?
Ever think of that?
But there was a Hell.
And no matter where we moved to,
I was in it.
We rented rooms on the waterfront of New Orleans.
Your skin is icy.
Your friend has no head for wine.
Don't worry.
I can warm that cold skin of yours better than she can.
Do you think so?
Why...
...you're warm now!
But the price is high.
Your pretty friend, I exhausted her.
Soft.
So soft.
I can see you lying on a bed of satin.
Such things you say.
Do you know what manner of bed?
Should we put out the light?
And then put out the light.
But once I've put out thy light...
...I cannot...
...give it vital breath again.
Its needs must wither.
For you, Louis.
You can pretend it's wine.
She's not dead!
You're in love with your mortal nature.
You resist what can bring you peace.
You call this peace?
We're predators, whose all-seeing eyes give them detachment!
- The girl, Lestat!
- Take her! End that hunger!
No!
Now, my child.
You're tired, you want to sleep!
It's a coffin!
A coffin! Let me out!
I'm not dead!
It's your coffin, enjoy it. Most of us never get to know what it feels like.
Why do you do this?
I like to do it. I enjoy it.
Take your aesthete's taste to purer things.
Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it!
For do not doubt you are a killer, Louis!
- What's that?
- It's a coffin.
So it is. You must be dead.
I'm not dead, am I?
You're not dead.
Not yet.
Finish this now!
You finish it!
Save me from him!
Save me!
You'll let me go?
I can't die like this!
I need a priest.
My friend is a priest.
He'll hear your sins before you die.
Unless... I make her one of us.
No!
Then take her, Louis, end her suffering!
End yours!
No!
Now...
...are you happy?
My God!
To think you...
...are all I have to learn from.
In the Old World...
...they called it the "dark gift."
And I gave it to you.
Don't go that way, Monsieur.
It's the plague.
- Go back the way you came!
- The way I came...
Mama.
Please help us.
Papa left us and didn't come back.
Please, wake Mama, Monsieur.
My philosopher. My martyr.
"Never take a human life."
This calls for a celebration.
There's still life in the old lady yet.
Come back!
You are what you are!
Merciful death.
How you love your precious guilt.
Her blood coursed in my veins...
... sweeter than life itself.
And, as it did, Lestat's words made sense to me.
I knew peace only when I killed.
When I heard her heart in that terrible rhythm, I knew what peace could be.
All I need to find you, Louis, is follow the corpses of rats.
Pain is terrible for you.
You feel it like no other creature, because you're a vampire.
You don't want it to go on.
No.
Then do what it is in your nature to do...
...and you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.
Evil is a point of view.
God kills indiscriminately...
...and so shall we.
For no creatures under God are as we are.
None so like Him...
...as ourselves.
I have a gift for you.
Come.
Please.
- She's here.
- What are you saying?
You need...
...company...
...more congenial than mine.
Remember how you wanted her?
The taste of her?
I thought I'd killed her.
Don't worry.
Your conscience is clear.
Claudia.
Listen to me.
You're ill, my precious.
And I'm going to give you what you need to get well.
No.
You want her to die then?
That's it. Yes.
Stop!
Stop!
Enough!
I want some more.
Of course you want more.
Gently, chérie.
They're so innocent.
They must not be made to suffer.
Good.
Yes.
All right, now.
Stop.
That's enough, chérie.
You must stop before the heart stops.
I want more.
I know.
But it's best in the beginning...
...lest the Death takes you down with it.
You've done very well. Look at you.
Not a drop spilt. Very good.
Where is Mama?
Mama's gone...
...to Heaven, chérie, like that sweet lady... right there.
They all go to Heaven.
All but us.
Do you want to frighten our daughter?
I'm not your daughter.
Oh, yes, you are.
You're my and Louis' daughter now.
You see, Louis was going to leave us.
He was going to go away.
But now he's not.
Now he's going to stay...
...and make you happy.
Louis.
You fiend.
One happy family.
He did it to make you stay with him?
Perhaps.
He knew me. He knew I would love her more than the waking world.
But there was more to it.
He lavished affection on her, there is no doubt about that.
Perhaps, in the end, he did it because he was lonely too.
- I need more light.
- She needs more light.
- I'll go blind without another lamp.
- She'll go blind.
Or let me fit this child during the day.
Well, I am afraid, madame, that my days are sacrosanct.
A little child, she was.
But also a fierce killer...
... now capable of the ruthless pursuit of blood with all a child's demanding.
Let me kiss it better.
Now...
...who will we get to finish your dress?
Be practical!
Remember, never in our home!
She slept in my coffin at first...
... curling her little fingers around my hair...
... till the day when she wanted her own coffin.
But still, whenever she awoke...
... she would crawl into mine.
They died fast in those days, before, she learned to play with them...
... to delay the moment till she had taken what she wanted.
Why are you crying, child?
Are you lost, my love?
Mama!
Hush, now, don't cry.
We'll find her.
Mind the thumb, girl. Mind the thumb.
That little digit.
They're expensive, my dear.
Maybe too expensive for a young girl like you.
Claudia! What have we told you!
Never in the house.
Give me some room.
To me, she was a child.
But to Lestat, a pupil...
... an infant prodigy with a lust for killing like his own.
Together, they finished off whole families.
Wonderful, wonderful.
Now try something on a more somber note.
Time can pass quickly for mortals when they're happy.
With us, it was the same.
The years flew by like minutes.
The city grew.
Sailboats gave way to steamships...
... disgorging an endless menu of magnificent strangers.
A new world had sprung up around us.
And we were all Americans now.
This filthy modern tide!
What I wouldn't give for a drop of old-fashioned Creole blood!
Yankees are not to your taste?
Their Democratic flavor doesn't suit my palate, Louis.
Now that is pure Creole.
Trust Claudia to have found her.
What?
Don't you want her?
I want to be her.
Can I?
Be like her one day?
More melancholy nonsense.
You grow more like Louis daily!
Soon you'll be eating rats.
Rats? When did you eat rats, Louis?
It was a long, long time ago.
Before you were born.
And I don't recommend them.
Thirty years had passed, yet her body remained that of an eternal child.
Her eyes alone told the story of her age, staring from under her curls...
... with a questioning...
... that would one day need an answer.
Another doll.
I have dozens, you realize.
I thought you could use one more.
Why always on this night?
What do you mean?
You always give me a doll on the same night of the year.
I didn't realize.
Is this my birthday?
You dress me like a doll.
You make my hair like a doll.
Why?
Some of these, Claudia, are so old...
...tattered.
- You should throw them away.
- I will, then!
What have you done?
What you told me to do!
- You leave a corpse here to rot?
- I wanted her!
- I wanted to be her!
- She's mad!
She pollutes the very house we live in!
Do you want me to be a doll forever?
Don't!
Why not? Can't I change...
...like everyone else?
Which one of you did it?
Which one of you did it?
Which one of you made me the way I am?
What you are?
A vampire gone insane, that pollutes its own bed!
And if I cut my hair again?
It will grow back again.
But it wasn't always so!
I had a mother once.
And Louis, he had a wife.
He was mortal, same as she.
And so was I!
You made us what we are!
Stop her.
Did you do it to me?
How did you do it?
And why should I tell you?
It's in my power.
Why yours alone?
Tell me how it was done!
Be glad...
...I made you what you are.
You'd be dead now if I hadn't.
Like that damned corpse!
Now get rid of it!
You get rid of it.
Louis, why?
You've got to tell me.
You see the old woman?
That will never happen to you.
You will never grow old.
And you will never die.
And it means something else too, doesn't it?
I shall never, ever grow up.
I hate him.
Tell me how it came to be that I am this...
...thing.
For thirty years I'd avoided that place.
Yet I found my way back there...
... with hardly an upward glance.
You...
...fed on me?
Yes.
And he found me with you.
Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him...
...and you were a vampire then...
...and have been every night thereafter.
You both did it.
I took your life.
He gave you another one.
And here it is.
I hate you both.
I walked all night.
I walked as I walked years before...
... when my mind swam with guilt at the thought of killing.
I thought of all the things
I'd done and couldn't undo.
And I longed for one second's peace.
Locked together in hatred.
But I can't hate you, Louis.
Louis, my love.
I was mortal till you...
...gave me your immortal kiss.
You became my mother and my father.
And so I'm yours forever.
But now it's time to end it, Louis.
Now it's time to leave him.
He will never let us go.
Really?
What is it now? You irritate me.
Your very presence...
...irritates me!
Does it?
I found someone who'll be a vampire better than you both!
Is that supposed to frighten me?
You're spoiled, because you're an only child.
You need a brother.
Or I do.
I'm weary of you both.
I suppose we could people the world with vampires...
...the three of us.
Oh, not you...
...my little Claudia.
You're a liar.
But you upset my plans.
What plans?
I came to make peace with you.
Even though you're the father of lies...
...I want things to be as they were.
Stop pestering me then.
I must do more than that.
I've brought a present for you.
Then I hope it's...
...a beautiful woman...
...with endowments you'll never possess.
Why do you say such things?
You haven't fed enough.
I can tell by your color.
Come and see.
Don't be angry with me.
When I saw them,
I knew they were for you.
Drunk...
...on brandywine. A thimbleful.
You certainly have...
...outdone yourself.
I promise I'll get rid of the bodies.
We forgive each other then?
Yes.
Absinthe?
You've given them absinthe?
No.
Laudanum.
Laudanum.
Yes.
It killed them, unfortunately.
But it keeps the blood warm.
You let me drink...
...dead blood?
You let me...
...drink...
One lesson you taught me...
...never drink from the dead.
Put me in my coffin.
Put me in my coffin.
I'll put you in your coffin!
My God!
Lift me up!
Good night, sweet prince.
May flights of devils wing you to your rest.
Should we burn him?
Bury him?
What would he have liked?
The swamp?
He belongs with those reptiles.
He deserved to die.
Then perhaps so do we, every night of our lives.
He was my maker.
He gave me this life...
...whatever it is.
It shouldn't have been this way.
I did it for us.
So we could be free.
You missed him?
He was all I knew.
It's as simple as that.
We were like two orphans learning to live again.
We booked a passage to Europe.
Over the weeks, while waiting for the boat...
... she studied the myths and legends of the Old World...
... obsessed with the search of what she called "our kind."
Look who we forgot.
Let's set them free.
- Yes.
- Yes.
It's the carriage.
Listen, Louis...
...there's life...
...in these old hands still.
Not quite furioso.
Moderato...
...cantabile, perhaps.
How could it be?
Ask the alligator.
His blood helped.
Then, on a diet of the blood of snakes...
...toads...
...and all the putrid life...
...of the Mississippi...
...slowly...
...Lestat became something...
...like himself again.
You've been...
...a very...
...very...
...naughty little girl.
The ship is sailing without us!
Though the fire seemed to spread...
... I stood on that deck, fearful, he would come out again...
... from the river like some monster, to destroy us.
And all the while I thought...
"Lestat...
"...we deserve your vengeance.
"You gave me the 'dark gift'...
"...and I delivered you into the hands of Death for the second time. "
Though the ship was blessedly free of rats...
... a strange plague nonetheless struck its passengers.
Claudia and I alone seemed immune.
We kept to ourselves...
... pondering the mystery of each other.
We reached the Mediterranean.
I wanted those waters to be blue... but they were black...
... night-time waters.
And how I suffered then...
... straining to recall the color that in my youth I took for granted.
We searched village after village...
... ruin after ruin...
... country after country.
And always we found nothing.
I began to believe we were the only ones.
There was a strange comfort in that thought.
For what could the damned really have to say to the damned?
You found nothing?
Peasant rumors...
...superstitions about garlic...
...crosses...
...the old stake in the heart.
But one of our kind?
Not a whisper.
There are no vampires in Transylvania?
No Count Dracula?
Fictions, my friend.
The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman.
Paris...
... September, 1870.
The city I'd always dreamed of.
I was Creole, after all, and Paris was the mother of New Orleans.
A universe whole and entire unto herself.
We were alive again.
Just the two of us.
And so euphoric was I that I yielded to her every desire.
So it was...
... when I'd given up the search for vampires...
... that a vampire found me.
Buffoon!
Santiago!
I've searched the world for an immortal and this is what I find!
Bring the petite beauty with you.
No one will harm you.
I won't allow it.
And...
...remember my name:
Armand.
Remember what I told you.
They have different powers.
They'll read your thoughts.
He's the one, that's the vampire.
Two lovers...
...wandering down their violet way...
...whose passionate embraces, each to each...
...permit no meditations on decay...
...until they find themselves...
...within my reach!
Vampires who pretend to be humans pretending to be vampires.
How avant-garde.
The monk whose soul with
Heaven doth commune...
...and spends his days...
...in pious contemplation...
...finds he will meet his Maker all too soon.
For all his prayers gets no remuneration.
The lesson endeth here...
...and it is this:
Each one of you, my clammy hands must touch.
Each one must bend his forehead to my kiss.
But, hark!
Methinks a mortal doth approach!
What have we here?
What beauty by my side?
A rose in bloom, a shrinking violet?
Perhaps she has a mind to be my bride.
Perhaps my lesson has not ended yet!
I don't want to die!
But Death we are and have always been.
Someone help me!
Please!
- What have I done?
- We all die!
But I'm young!
Death is no respecter of age!
It can come any time, any place.
Just as this flesh is pink now...
...so it will turn gray and wrinkle with age.
Let me live! I don't care!
Then why should you care if you die now?
And suppose Death had a heart to love and to release you?
To whom would he turn his passion?
Would you choose a person from the crowd there?
A person to suffer as you do?
Monsieur Vampire, take me!
I adore you!
You wait your turn!
Well...
Do you know what it means to be loved by Death?
To become our bride?
No pain.
No pain.
Monstrous.
We live beneath.
Let me show you.
Monstrous.
Yes.
But very beautiful.
Welcome to my home.
Try him.
Two vampires...
...from the New World...
...come to guide us into the new era...
...as all we love slowly rots...
...and fades away.
Are you the leader of this group?
If there were a leader...
...I would be the one.
- So you have the answers?
- So you have questions?
What are we?
Nothing...
...if not vampires.
Who made us what we are?
Surely you know the one who made you?
Yes, but the one who made him?
The source...
...of all this...
...evil.
I understand.
I saw you in the theater.
Your suffering...
...your sympathy for that girl.
You die...
...when you kill.
You feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing.
But does that make you evil?
Since you comprehend what you call goodness, doesn't that make you...
...good?
Then there is nothing?
Perhaps.
But perhaps...
...this...
...is the only real evil left.
Then God does not exist?
I know nothing of God.
Or the Devil.
I have never seen a vision, nor learned a secret...
...that would damn or save my soul.
As far as I know...
...after 400 years...
...I am the oldest...
...living vampire...
...in the world.
Then it's as I always feared.
You fear too much.
So much you make me fear...
The one who made you...
...should have told you this.
The one who left the Old
World for the New...
He knew nothing.
Nor did he care.
Knew?
Come, beloved.
It's time we were on our way.
I'm hungry...
...and the city awaits.
The place was empty as we left.
Silent as the grave.
And as we blundered through it, again came the thought:
"I have wronged Lestat.
"I have hated him for the wrong reasons."
How did you wrong him?
You said a name.
Yes, a name I don't care to say again.
There is but one crime...
...among us vampires here.
It is the crime that means death to any vampire:
To kill your own kind.
- Do you think I'd let them harm you?
- No, you would not.
Danger holds you to me.
Love holds you to me.
- Love?
- Love.
You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.
Never.
He wants you as you want him.
He's been waiting for you.
He wants you as a companion.
He bides his time there.
He finds it as dull and lifeless as we do.
Perhaps.
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word?
"Let him go," he said.
"Let him go."
Is that what I should do?
Let you go?
My father...
...my Louis...
...who made me?
It will be all right.
You really believe that?
The soldier...
...on returning from the war...
...thinks victory has enured him against sorrow...
...till Death comes by...
...and chops him from his horse.
I was waiting for you.
Listen to me.
Claudia is very dear to me.
She's my daughter.
Your lover.
No, my beloved.
My child.
You say so. You're innocent.
She's in danger, isn't she?
- She is.
- Why?
I could give you reasons.
Her silence.
Her youth.
It's forbidden to make one so young...
... so helpless...
... that cannot survive on its own.
Then blame the one who made her.
Did you kill this vampire who made you both?
Is that why you won't say his name?
Santiago thinks you did.
- We want no quarrel with him.
- It's already begun.
If you want to save her...
...send her away!
- Then I leave too.
So soon?
Without any of those answers you so longed for?
You said there are none.
But you asked the wrong questions.
Do you know...
...how few vampires...
...have the stamina for immortality?
How quickly they perish of their own will.
The world...
...changes.
We do not.
Therein lies the irony...
...that finally kills us.
I need you to make contact with this age.
Me?
Don't you see?
I'm not the spirit of any age.
I'm at odds with everything.
I always have been.
That is the very spirit of your age.
The heart of it.
Your fall...
...from grace...
...has been the fall of a century.
But the vampires in the theater?
Decadent...
... useless.
They can't reflect anything.
But...
...you do.
You reflect...
...its broken heart.
A vampire...
...with a human soul.
An immortal with a mortal's passion.
You...
...are...
...beautiful, my friend.
Lestat must have wept when he made you.
You knew Lestat?
Yes.
I knew him.
Knew him well enough not to mourn his passing.
I felt a kind of peace at last.
I had found the teacher which Lestat could never, I knew now, have been.
I knew knowledge would never be withheld by Armand.
It would pass through him as through a pane of glass.
Madeleine...
...Louis is shy.
Drink.
Do it.
Because I cannot do it.
I haven't the strength.
- You saw to that when you made me.
- You don't know what you ask!
I have.
You have found your new companion!
You will make me mine!
How do we seem to you?
Do you find us beautiful?
Magical?
Our white skin, our fierce eyes?
Do you know the thing you will become?
Your evil is that you cannot be evil!
And I shall suffer for it no longer!
Don't make me do this! I cannot!
Yet, you could do it to me.
Snatching me from my mother's hands, like two monsters in a fairy tale.
And now you weep!
I haven't tears enough for what you've done to me!
You give her to me, Louis!
Do this before you leave me!
Oh, God!
I love you still!
That's the torment of it!
Who'll care for me, my love...
...my dark angel, when you are gone?
What do you think she is, Madeleine?
A doll?
A child who cannot die.
And the child who did die?
My daughter.
What's happening to her?
She's dying.
It happened to you too...
...only you were too young to remember.
But if she dies?
It's only mortal death.
Bear me no ill will, my love.
We are now even.
What do you mean?
What died in that room was not that woman.
What has died is the...
...last breath in me...
...that was human.
Yes, Father.
At last we are even.
It's time for justice, little one.
Get me Armand.
He wouldn't stand for this.
Death for the others.
For you...
...eternity in a box.
Walled in a dungeon.
Your only company will be your screams.
Perhaps it will take centuries.
Take them!
Pleasant dreams.
No! No!
Help!
Wake up!
Where's Claudia?
Claudia. I cannot help her.
- Where's Claudia?
- I can't save her!
I will only risk losing you!
Don't!
Come, Louis.
Not here.
So a vampire can cry?
Once...
...maybe twice, in eternity.
And maybe it was to quench those tears forever that I took such revenge.
Stop him! It's burning!
Get him! Stop him!
You didn't even warn them, did you?
No.
And you knew what I would do.
I knew.
I rescued you, didn't I?
From the terrible dawn.
You were their leader. They trusted you.
No.
You made me see their failings, Louis.
They were...
...doomed, stuck in their decadent time.
They had forgotten the first lesson...
...that we must be powerful...
...beautiful...
...and without regret.
You can teach me this?
Yes.
To be without regret?
Then, what a pair we could make.
But what if it's a lesson
I don't care to learn?
What?
What if all I have is my suffering?
My regret?
Don't you want to lose it?
So you can have that too?
The heart that mourns her...
...whom you burnt to a cinder?
I swear I didn't...
But I know you did.
I know...
...you...
...regret nothing.
You feel...
...nothing.
If that's all I have left to learn...
...I can do that on my own.
I will die.
No.
You are dead.
And you want me to quicken you once more.
And as much as your invitation might appeal to me...
...I must regretfully...
...decline.
For years I wandered:
Italy, Greece...
... all the ancient lands.
But the world was a tomb to me...
... a graveyard full of broken statues.
And each of those statues resembled her face.
Then, out of curiosity...
... boredom, who knows what...
... I left the Old World...
... and came back to my America.
And there a mechanical wonder allowed me to see the sunrise...
... for the first time...
... in 200 years.
And what sunrises!
Seen as the human eye could never see them.
Silver at first...
... then, as the years progressed, in tones of purple...
... red...
... and my long-lost blue.
In the spring of 1988,
I returned to New Orleans.
And as soon as I smelled the air,
I knew I was home.
It was rich...
... almost sweet...
... like the fragrance of jasmine and roses around our old courtyard.
I walked the streets savoring that long-lost perfume.
And then on Prytania Street...
... only blocks from the
Lafayette cemetery...
... I caught the scent of death.
And it wasn't coming from the graves.
The scent grew stronger as I walked.
Old death.
A scent too faint for mortals to detect.
I'm so glad you are here!
I've dreamed...
...of this moment.
She never should have been one of...
...us.
That's all past, Lestat.
Past.
Still beautiful, Louis.
You always were the strong one.
Don't be frightened.
I mean you no harm.
You've come home to me then?
You remember how I was?
The vampire...
...that I was?
Yes, I remember.
No one...
...could refuse me...
...not even you.
I tried.
Yes, you tried.
And the more you tried...
...the more I wanted you.
I can't bear it.
Such lights...
...and that noise!
They make the night brighter than the day.
It's false light.
It can't harm you.
If you stay with me, Louis...
...I could venture out again.
Become the old Lestat.
I must leave now.
Whatever happened to Lestat,
I do not know.
I go on...
...night after night.
I feed on those who cross my path.
But all my passion went with her golden hair.
I'm a spirit of preternatural flesh.
Detached.
Unchangeable.
Empty.
Empty?
That's it?
No, it can't end like that.
But it has.
There's no more to tell.
There must be more to tell. You don't understand yourself. You're not empty.
What I wouldn't give to be like you, to have your power...
...to have seen the things you have seen.
You haven't been listening.
I have been listening.
Your story is incredible.
- It's amazing.
- Do what you want with it.
Give it to others. Learn what you can.
There's only one way I'll truly learn and you know it.
You brought me here for a reason.
Didn't you?
What reason would that be?
You want a companion. You want a link to the outside world. That's me.
Take me. That's what I want.
- I refuse to let it end like this.
- God, I've failed again.
You haven't failed.
God has nothing to do with it.
Do you like this?
Do you like being food for the immortals?
Do you like dying?
Stop!
1791 was the year it happened.
I was 24. Younger than you are now.
But times were different then.
I was a man at that age.
The master of a large plantation, just south of New Orleans.
I had lost my wife in childbirth.
Someone change my shorts.
She and the infant had been buried less than half a year.
It's good stuff.
I would've been happy to join them.
Good stuff.
I assume I need no introduction.
I feel better already.
Most of all, I longed for death.
I invited it.
A release from the pain of living.
Still whining.
Heard enough?
I've had to listen to that for centuries.
Don't be afraid.
I'm going to give you the choice...
...I never had.
Subtitles conformed by SOFTITLER
I see your vision in the darkness every time I close my eyes 
I can feel the heat from your body it won't let me it won't let me sleep at night
I hear you whisper slow nice things
You're my addiction
I can't face the new day baby until I receive your kiss sunlight becomes my enemy don't want my friends to see me like this
I need more and more you're the sickness then the cure you're my addiction yes you are
It's the loneliness that keeps you coming back again and again
The habit you know that is killing you it becomes your only friend but you make me feel more alive then I've ever been
You're my sanctuary
Baby let me in, you're my addiction
Addiction
You're a shelter from the storm
You're my addiction
When I don't have a friend
You're a face without a name baby 
It began in the early morning.
The American soldiers were under orders to search and destroy enemy positions
They came upon the village at dawn.
What they did in that place later shocked the world.
The adminstration sensitive to world opinion brought to trial the men responsible and found them guilty. Justice though blind was served.
The conscience of a outraged society was temporarily satisfied.
The whole country they were all guilty.
How can you single out one man?
You can't jail a whole country. You know.
They needed a scapegoat.
He was the unlucky one that got caught.
I don't think luck had anything to do with it.
I mean, how did he get over there?
Who put the gun in his hand?
They say he was guilty of killing women and babies.
How many bombs where dropped that did the exact same thing?
How many homes were destroyed?
Who's in jail for that?
What do you want me to say? The systems not perfect.
You know. People just wanted to show that their disgust by what was happening. and justifiably so, I mean..
I'm not saying it wasn't justifiable
I'm only saying that, if you're going to prosecute war crimes you better make sure that more than one man takes the blame for everything, that's ridiculous
So where are you going?
I gotta meet my brother. Okay, I'm gonna go this way, see you later. yeah
Nice night, yes
Look at me and tell me to go away.
Don't ask tell me!
Please
Please don't hurt me
You think that's gonna stop me?
But please
Fuckin' good
Collaborater
You wanna know what's gonna happen?
Just wait and see...
Okay lady, you left a description of the perp after they sanitized the area.
If you see her again on the street just call 911. if we happen to pick her up
Your're gonna have to come into the station house to view a line-up.
Your're lucky she didn't cut your throat!
Oh my God
Aah Fuck
Yeah
One aspect of determinism is manifested in the fact that the unsaved don't recognize the sin in their lives.
Their unconscious of it.
They don't suffer pangs of conscience because they don't recognize evil exists.
This is because their all pre-destined to hell and therefore never brought to the light of metanoia or conversion.
Which is a work of grace only in a believers life. so when considering the salvatory aspect of facing guilt suffering is a good thing we should all hope to feel guilty to feel pain and seek pardon and ultimately freedom.
Guilt is a sign that God is working out your destiny and it's a foolish person who refuses to acknowledge this.
Now in the case of the institutions, if you look on page 36
Katherine, If we look on page 36
Hi Kathy, I'm your attending physician.
How do you feel? Well the test do not indicate anything to serious and the wound shows absolutely no infection.
The AIDS virus couldn't manifest itself so quickly. If you're curious about?
What we really think is going on is that, you probably have some chronic anemia which has been exacerbated by traumaticevent. We're just gonna keep you here for a few days. build you up with fluids and iron should be on your way in no time.
Any question? and if you need help in the mean time, just ring for the nurse okay. 
Hi where have you been?
In the infirmary, I haven't been feeling well.
You're not kidding you don't look so good.
Did they give you something for it?
Medicine is just an extended metaphor for omnipotence. They gave me antibiotics.
So why aren't you taking them?
What are you looking at?  Huh, i didn't mean to stare.
You all right? Yeah
Did you read the assignment for the
Cassidy seminar? Ya did you go through it? through it? 
They're all liars. Let them rot with cancer. We'll see what they have to say about free will. about free will. How can you eat and read that stuff at the same time? What is with you?
You have to question the sanity of bothering to a dissertation on these idiots.
Well it was either this or an EDD it was are only other option.
Have you seen the exhibit? No. You wanna go? 
Yeah, I'll meet you after class. Okay.
This is what the German's believed let there be know mistake about it. Did deliberately and slowly the doctors, authors, lawyers, musicians, to professional people of every kind.
I know clearly one half the truth that and that is one half more than they recognize.
The old adage from santiana
That those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat is a lie.
There is no history. Everything we are is eternally with us.
Our question is therefore. What can save us from our crazy insistence of of spreading the blight never widening circles.
Being nothingness, Being in time ideas sickness unto death Kirkegaard will to power Nietzsche for next week I want you to finish the first 120 pages of Sartre is Being and Nothingness. Are there any questions? Okay class dismissed.
I heard you weren't feeling well. Are you all right now? Yes
Thanks. You still want to meet at 7:00?
Yes you can bring whatever you've done so far. Okay maybe we can grab something to eat eat while we're at it? That's fine
You sure you're up to it? Yeah
It makes no difference what I do. Whether
I draw blood or not. It's the violence of my will against theirs.
Is there something wrong? You haven't said a word all night long.
Silence has two aspects one according
Sartre,the other to Max Picard why don't you guess why I'm quiet. To amuse you?
What is it? Did I say something to upset you?
You're to egotistical professor.
True, but what is it what you are?
Uhm
Look it's getting late, we ought to get work.
Some things are more important than others.
Besides aren't you the one who excuse speculative philosophy 
I've come to terms with my existence. Applying what
I've learned my own being.
Will get to the thesis in good time.
Such sad music, isn't it?
It's making me depressed.
Let's go.
Listen. I think I'd better go home.
It hasn't been the most enjoyable evening you know. Ssh, come up.
So you want something to drink?
What do you got? Anything you want.
Hold on a minute.
I got something.
Dependency is a marvelous thing. It does more for the soul than any formulation doctor or material. Indulge me
Give me your arm.
I'll try to fuck anything tonight. What's up girlfriend?
Where you going girlfriend?
What's your name?
My name is Black. You know what I'm saying?
You into jungle fever or what?
I'll be seeing you. Alright
I'll be out here alot. You know what I'm saying?
Oh the stench here is worse than at Charnal house.
This is a graveyard. Rosa crumbling tombstones vicious libelous epitaphs, and we're all drawn here like flies.
How's it going? Uh, take a look.
Yeah, me too. What's your major?
Anthropology. Hmm do you like it?
What else is there? Man is the measure of all things.
Protagoras. Right?
What do you study?
Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy.
Are you ever afraid to walk these streets?
Yeah always.
What choice do we have? It's that or go to college in South Dakota. We're not good all. That's a choice.
Not that would make me happy. I like it here.
Do you live in the dorms? Yeah you?
My own apartment. You want to come over? I'm going straight through till morning. We can have some coverage. Our we gonna talk more about Feuerbach? Sure. I'll come over.
What the hell were you thinking?
Why didn't you just tell me to go? Why didn't you say get lost? Like you really meant it.
I was afraid you'd hurt me. Worse than I've done?
I don't even no what you've done. I don't even no what the hell this is.
I'm I gonna get sick now? No.
No worse than you were before.
What is that suppose to mean?
How can you act so glibly?
Look what you've done to me.
How can you do this? Doesn't this affect you at all?
No. It was your decision.
Your friend Feuerbach wrote: that all men counting stars are equivalent in every way to God. My indifference is not the concern here.
It's your astonishment the need study.
Where were you? I was calling you all last night.
Ah, in the library. Uh
Maybe you should slow down Kat. I don't know if you'd seen what you look like lately but...
I've never felt better in my whole life.

I should be worry about you. Oh man! Oh fuck!
Kathy, you alright?
Yeah, I just remembered I forgot something upstairs, okay.
So I'll see ya later.

Delivery
Miss Conklin? Yeah
Thanks
Oh jeez! Come on
I need to talk to you Jean. 
You're welcome for the flowers. Come on.
Come on i wanna talk to you. okay, alright. Please let's talk.
I met a guy he's a vet and I spent a couple of night with him.
Since when do you smoke?
You know what he does all day?
He kills cows, he works on slaughterhouse. in blood up to his ankles. I asked him how come? He says a career after
4 years at preparation at Princeton couldn't compete what they taught him in
Southeast Asia. At night he just rides around in his meat truck he picks up hitchhikers and take some wherever they want to go.
You're halfway through your dissertation. You don't go to class you don't study, you don't conference
I don't know what the hell you're doing?
Every philosopher had a predecessor without whom his system of philosophy could have never developed. The same could be said for all of us but you see it's all failed. Because our predecessor doesn't have a name. Predecessor to what?
I don't know what you're talking about?
Gilt doesn't pass with time, Jean. It's eternal.
Yeah. The appetites insatiable that's what I've learned the past couple weeks.
You're not gonna try to deny that are you?
At least show me you've learned that to.
Show you what? You want an apology for ethical relativis or something? No
Prove there's no evil and you can go.
What do you mean I can go? The mayor's at my house I had to cover them up why do you think that is? huh what is? What is it in my face that I don't want to look at?
Kathy starting to scare me now. you know that?
It's these eyes it's the eyes. Eventually everyone does the same.
Kathy you want my advice? You should get to the infirmary. You think he'll shuts down after a couple years? You think what you've done isn't floating around somewhere in space? What makes you think been forgiven for lying to your motheras a child huh? or for haven slept with married men and adultery or paying taxes that turned
Central America into a mud puddle huh
What does...Here come here
I want to take you to the girls room. All right?
Come here I wanna show you something.
Come here
What are you afraid of ? You wanna see something?
Jesus! I'm rotting inside but I'm not dying. I could go on like this for ever.
Kathy now come on we're all golden to the dead. Most of us go for plastic surgery to hide the blemishes. She can't cover the disease that originates. I don't even who you're talking too?
Kathy you gotta get some help.
Yah know it's to disheartening especially in a doctoral candidate yah outta know better.
I ought to know what better? You're acting like a lunatic.
Sure it's easy to spout people like me the cancers grown obvious but you're as terminal as I am. You know that? You're as addicted as I am. It's the nature of the organism. Is that what this is about? yeah that's it
Now look me in the face 
Tell me go.
Look sin in the face and tell it to go. Kathy
Please
That's what it does to you. You look me in the face and tell me to go. You're hurting me
You kidding me. I'll crush you like God
What do you want from me? Look me in the face tell me to go like you mean it.
Kathy, please, say it with authority now.
Let go! say it with authority.
Let Go! How you gonna see yourself after tonight please stop it! please stop it! please let go of me!
Kathy KATHY!
Because if you say that to me then I'll do anything to take it back.
Of course, of course...
...but why you can't enjoy it....
...it's all gone...
...then the proper things... huh
Why don't you just tell me leave me you alone?
Like you mean it.
Harder
You want to go someplace dark?
Mmm, your breath smells like shit. Know that?
You know how long I've been fasting?
40 years. The last time I shot up I had a dozen to happen one night. They fall like flies before the hunger, don't they?
You can never get enough. Can yah? But you learn to control it, you learn like the
Tibetans to survive on a little.  Yah Know.
So what you've been doing? What do you have inside. Any kids? Blood of any children?
First ones the hardest isn't it?
After that they're like all the rest.
Well, here we are.
The entire world's a graveyard and we the birds of prey picking at the bones.
I saw, we're the ones who let the dying know the hour has come. Sit
You think Nietzsche understood something?
Mankind has striven to exist beyond good and evil from he beginning.
You know what they found? You want tea?
No. Maybe later. How can you drink it?
Alot of people drink tea.
I mean people like us. I'm not like you you're nothing.
There's something you ought not to forget you're not a person you're nothing.
Have you read Naked Lunch? Burrows perfectly describes what it's like to go without a fix. Who are you?
My name is Peina. What do you want for me?
No!
What do you want from me? You came after me you took my hand you tried to force me somehow isn't that how it went? You think you understand things. You know
NOTHING! You understand Nothing! I'll show you what you are.
I'll teach what hunger is.
You thought the first time was difficult.
Relax it's a long time till sunrise.
You can't eat, you can't sleep, you can't even go out to satisfy the urge during the day you are slave to what you are and you're nothing. I defecate when's the last time you did that?
I'm almost human I eat I sleep I have a job, I can diet it took a long time.
You think you know what we are. The point is to blend in. Not to stand out like sore thumb. It's quality existence.
My habit is controlled by my will. True my will initially formed by my addiction.
But now strong enough to dictate the conditions of fulfilling my needs.
Then abstract whatever good is in you
I will use, for my sustenance and for you you'll feel as though you haven't eaten in weeks.
Demons suffer in hell.
Oh yeah ah oh ah
Oh
Oh
You can't kill what's dead. What?
Eternitys is a long time get used to it.
Please help, help me. What are you worried about you're not gonna die.
Pain, pain is something else, pain is something we all know but takes a special person to see pain. Please help me. Not that person believe me.
What's gonna happen to me? Read the books Sartre Beckett
Who do you think they're talking about?
You think they're works of fiction?
I felt the wind of the wings of madness
Baudelaire. I'll be back late. What? Be honest you were not trying to end it all just now. You were just trying to see if I left anything you could eat?
Anything for a fix!
Please
Please, please
Come on
Please help me
Please
Oh fuck
Hey, Lady you alright? You okay? come on let me get you up sweetie. You all right? Huh
Come on let me get you up, come on, come on
Let me get you, come on St. Francis is right over here.
I finally understand what all this is how it was all possible now I see. Good lord how we must look from out there our addiction is evil. The propensity for this evil lies in our weakness before it.
Kierkegaard was right. There is an awful precipice before us. But he was wrong about the leap. There's a difference between jumping and being pushed. 
You reach a point where you are forced to face your own needs. And the fact you can't terminate the situation settles on you with full force.
It's not cogito ergo sum but de dita ergo sum beco ergo sum the intrusion of values
Philosophy is propaganda.
There is always an attempt to influence the object to change it's view of things.
The real question is what is the philosophers impact on other egos transcendent or otherwise. Does that lie within the grammar of your thesis?
If we eliminate the verb we eliminate meaning.
The predicate defines the nouns role in being. That's why my analysis insisted on a discernible didacticism in the works of the philosopher. It belies his transcendence his independence, and the result.
Essence is revealed through praxis the philosophers words his ideas his actions cannot be separated from his value.
His meaning that's what it's all about.
Isn't it? Our impact on other egos.
Dean, Congratulation! Thank you. Doctor all the best.
I'd like to invite you faculty and friends to a small get together I'm having after the reception.
Okay I would be honored and I will be there you can bet on it.
Please be there. I will.
Thank you. Bye
Hi! Okay Okay See you there
There is a dual nature to the addiction.
It satisfies the hunger which evil engenders.
But it also dulls our perception so we are helped to forget how ill we really are. We drink to escape the fact we're alcoholics. Existence is the search for relief from our habit and our habit is the only relief we can find.
Good evening sister, how are you doing?
Here the good news God loves yous. 
God loves you.
Hear the word of God brother, we give free lunches at our Center every day it's on 35th Street the addresses is there. God loves you. Please come in side.

Hi, Hi Good... Just need some help...great thanks
...it's do to lack of enrollment I believe...
Everybody I would like to thank you all for coming here tonight to help me celebrate the ? on my degree. I would like to acknowledge a sincere debt of gratitude to the faculty and to the School.
All right! and I'd like to share a little bit of what I've learned
Through these long hard years of study.
Ha Ha Ha somebody call 911
Get some rest you're gonna be all right.
Nobody's gonna let you die.
Pick it up 1,2,3 1,2,3 1,2,3 Pick it up 1,2,3 My Fair Lady
Pick it up 1,2,3, 1,2,3 1,2,3 Pick it up 1,2,3 My Fair Lady HeeHe hmm-what? The blinds. You want me to open them?
Are you sure?
Seven Circle Huh?
Dante described it perfectly bleeding trees waiting for judgement day where we can all hang ourselves from our own branches. It's not that easy doctor.
To find rest takes a real genius.
It's all a matter of discernment.
Now R.C. Sproul said we're not sinners because we sin but we sin because we are sinners.
In more accessible terms we're not evil because of the evil we do but we do evil because we are evil.
Yeah
Now what choices do such people have? It's not not like we have any options.
Hi doctor how are ya?
Nice to see you haven't seen you lately how have you been, Good to see you.
Good morning.
How do you feel? Can I get you something?
I want to make a confession.
Are you a Catholic?
I was baptized
What would you like to confess?
God forgive me.
Oh mighty God have mercy on you forgive you all your sins through our
Lord Jesus Christ strengthen you in all goodness and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep you in eternal life.
The body of Christ.
Amen.
To face what we are in the end .
We stand before the light and our true nature is revealed. Self revelation is anihilation of self.
So, what happened this morning, Ray?
I don't fucking know, man.
It just come over me,
Iike something unstoppabIe, you know?
Next thing...
...I'm on top of him with a fucking shiv, and there's bIood...
...aII over the pIace.
AII over the pIace.
Fucking...
You know, pumping up 6 feet in the air from his throat, right?
So how does this make you feeI, Ray?
Taking someone eIse's Iife.
How does this make you feeI about yourseIf?
How do you feeI?
How do you...? How...?
What do you mean?
I feeI... I feeI...
I feeI great.
I fucking feeI fantastic.
How shouId I feeI, man?
I'm the one's gonna be aIive come morning, not that son of a bitch.
Hey, yeah.
How you feeI?
How do you feeI, doc?
You feeI OK?
You're sitting there Iooking at me Iike
I'm some kind of fucking head case.
You think I Iike that?
Hey!
I don't Iike it.
You think I Iike that I'm gonna spend the rest of my Iife in this shit-hoIe?
If I'm Iucky enough not to fry first?
The truth is, doc, I am...
...massiveIy fucked.
OK?
And you sitting there with your...
Your IittIe fucking prissy tape recorder and your questions.
No way you do me not one...
...ounce of fucking good, man.
Am I wrong?
Can you heIp me?
Can you...? You know...
Can you heIp me?
Can you do something?
Like rewire me so I start doing the right...
...fucking thing?
No!
I don't think so!
You're worthIess, man.
You got no moves.
What are you gonna do?
Do it.
Go ahead, fix me.
I'm here. I'm here.
Fix me, goddamn it!
Read the Iast part again, honey.
OK.
''How and in what way the chiId sense of his body is converted
''by acts of parentaI and other externaI vioIence
''into a kind of theater of fantastic horror.
''How, in a sense, demons are introduced into the seIf
''stiII remains to be seen.''
It sounds good, honey.
- What'd you do that for?
- I don't know.
Sometimes I just...
I just hate what I'm doing.
- What do you mean?
- Sometimes it just doesn't seem to make any sense.
You're upset about the new case at the prison, right?
Yeah, I am.
I am. This KoIberg, right?
He's in for 20 years for cutting up his high-schooI sweetheart.
Now, Iast week he kiIIs his ceIImate.
Now, if I can prove that he can be redeemed, that there's some vestige of conscience, of sanity, weII, that makes this guy eIigibIe to fry.
Come on.
You don't pass sentence.
That's for the judges, juries and Iawyers.
You have to fight to get this guy back to his souI...
...before anybody worries about what happens to him in court.
You know what
I'd reaIIy Iike to do?
I'd just Iike to cure one human being.
That's aII. Just one.
I'd Iike to prove once and for aII that you can shake a shattered mind and put it aII back together again.
That's what I'd reaIIy Iike to do.
The truth is, in aII my cIinicaI experience,
I've never reaIIy seen it happen.
Yeah, maybe it's aII buIIshit.
Maybe I'm just a fraud.
Oh, honey, come on.
You're not a fraud.
You're the best man I know.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
The best?
The best.
Even though I'm not interested in footbaII?
Even though you're not interested in footbaII.
OK. Ready for breakfast?
- Stop it.
- Samantha. Knock it off.
Come on.
- Ouch.
- Samantha!
Stop it.
Now eat the cereaI.
- Here, BiIIy. Here's your stuff.
- Stop it.
- Want some coffee?
- I'II take it with me.
- I'm gonna knock you out right now.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- God.
- Hey.
Eat the cereaI, come on.
Let's go say goodbye to your father.
Come here.
What time wiII you be home, honey?
- About 6:00.
- OK.
Here.
Come on. Hurry up.
Here, honey.
Here.
Get this.
Say goodbye to your father.
- Bye. We Iove you.
- Love you.
Stop at the grocery, OK?
- The grocery?
- Yeah. For garbage bags.
- Garbage bags?
- PIease?
- OK.
- Come on. Kids, Iet's go.
Bye.
Mary, I'm headed down to the prison for my fourth session with KoIberg.
Oh, pIease remind
Professor CoIIins that he'II be seeing aII my fourth-year thesis advisees this afternoon.
Put a note on my desk, wiII you pIease, in big Ietters:
''Garbage bags.''
And, oh, you'II be receiving a copy on criminaI psychoIogy this afternoon for the Psych Quarterly Review.
I'd appreciate it if you'd...
I'd appreciate it if you'd...
If you'd send a copy to aII the members of my postgraduate seminar.
And indicate that...
...this wiII be groundwork for the next few months of cIasses.
Mrs. Chrushank?
Yes?
I'm Dr. Webb.
Your husband's condition has stabiIized.
Oh, thank God.
It's a miracIe he survived that accident.
He'II Iive.
But, Mrs. Chrushank,
I'm sorry, we can't save his arm.
Oh, God.
- No.
- Now...
...I want you to Iisten to me very carefuIIy.
I can give him a new arm.
What do you...?
What do you mean? You...
OK, why don't you sit down.
Mr. Dean Kates,
Main Reception.
Mr. Dean Kates,
Main Reception.
You mean, Iike...?
Like a pIastic or...
...prosthetic or something?
We have a donor who suits your husband, who can give him a normaI human arm as fuIIy functionaI as the one he's Iost.
Now, unfortunateIy, I need to perform the operation immediateIy.
To maximize the chance of success,
I need your signature right away.
God. I don't know.
CouIdn't we...?
CouIdn't we wait and ask him?
There's no time, I'm afraid.
Every second counts.
Police officers and life support
techs report to O.R. 5.
BiII...
BiII...
There's nothing to worry about.
Everything's gonna be just fine.
Hi, honey.
Hi.
BiII...
...I'm Dr. Webb.
You Iost your arm in a car accident yesterday.
We've transpIanted another arm for you.
I'm sorry.
CouId we be aIone for a few minutes, pIease?
Of course.
It's going to be aII right, honey.
We'II get through this, OK?
I swear.
Can you move it?
It's a process.
We take it one step at a time, one day at a time.
Try again.
Shit.
Good.
Very good.
Lab 3-1 3 to the emergency room.
Lab 3-1 3 to the emergency room.
You can do it.
- Did you see that?
- I did.
You're not supposed to touch that, you dumbbeII.
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on guys, stop it.
Hey, you two.
Remember me?
- You gIad Daddy's coming home?
- Yeah.
HeIIo, Karen.
Hi, doctor.
BiIIy.
Dr. Webb, I...
I can't find the words to thank you.
- Get in cIoser.
- Mr. Chrushank, how does it feeI
- to have someone eIse's arm?
- Come on.
How does your famiIy feeI about the operation?
Mr. Chrushank, do you think the operation wiII affect your sex Iife?
Mr. Chrushank, can you show us your arm so we couId get a shot?
- HoId it up to the cameras.
- Let's have a Iook at it.
I reaIIy don't think you peopIe shouId be taIking to me.
You shouId be pointing the cameras at Dr. Webb.
She's going to be a NobeI Prize winner.
CouId we have a comment?
- Dr. Webb.
- Question, pIease.
We hope that in a few years' time the procedure which BiII Chrushank underwent wiII become commonpIace.
Other than to pay tribute to the courage of BiII Chrushank, there's nothing more to say.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Dr. Webb...
- Move in. Move in. Got that?
- Did you get that?
- Dr. Webb!
- HoId on!
You know, guys,
Mommy expIained why
I was away in the hospitaI, right?
And she toId you I got hurt and...
WeII, they took care of me in the hospitaI, and I'm aII better now.
And I just want to know if you have any questions.
No, Dad, no questions.
No questions.
No questions?
I Iove you guys very much.
And...
WeII, I don't want you to worry about anything.
I'm here now.
And I'm the same oId daddy I was before.
OK, and if you did worry about anything, you'd teII me, right?
- Can we see the arm, Daddy?
- Oh, honey.
Daddy just got home.
Maybe Iater, OK?
- PIease?
- Dope-head.
It's aII right.
- Yeah.
- You sure?
Sure.
They gotta see it sooner or Iater, no time Iike the present.
There it is, guys.
- Mommy.
- Oh, honey, it's OK.
- It's aII right. Come on.
- Dad, it's sort of gross.
Come on, guys,
I know it Iooks a IittIe funny, but...
It's not how it Iooks, it's how it works, right?
And it does work as good as the oId arm.
Matter of fact, it works even better in some ways.
- Even better, Pop?
- Even better, BiIIy.
I stiII Iove you, Daddy.
I Iove you, baby.
BiIIy, I teII you what, why don't we go out and throw the footbaII around.
- You mean it, Pop?
- Yeah, come on.
Oh, yeah.
- Throw it to me, Daddy.
- Throw it to you?
How about if I throw you?
Come on, BiIIy.
I missed you so much.
It doesn't bother you to touch the scars?
I thought it wouId, but...
Keep doing that.
Bye.
What?
What are you guys Iaughing at, huh?
Get in there.
Now, four months ago, we were discussing the psychoIogicaI roots and weIIsprings of human vioIence.
To continue on that, what we have before us, a paradox, you see.
Because vioIence, when it's sanctioned by the state, is acceptabIe to us.
For exampIe, poIicemen defending our famiIies and soIdiers defending our country.
We ceIebrate them as heroes.
But this is not the case with the so-caIIed freeIance individuaI.
Because we regard individuaI acts of vioIence with repugnance and revuIsion.
What is it that makes a man, or a woman for that matter, who is normaI in most respects...
...Iose controI...
...of the restraints...
...that make him... a civiIized being...
...and do severe harm to others?
WeII...
...that's a mystery.
And a mystery that you and I must expIore...
...to its very depths.
Shit!
Son of a bitch!
- Daddy, Daddy, what happened?
- Shit!
- What are you Iooking at?!
- BiII, what's the matter?
- Jesus.
- Oh, man.
- How's it going, doc?
- AII right.
Heard you've been on the TV.
Heard you were a reguIar freak of science.
- I've been pretty Iucky.
- Is that right?
You don't Iook reaI good.
What do you mean?
What do you mean, what do I mean?
You Iook...
...Iike about how I usuaIIy feeI.
Be more specific.
What do you mean?
You Iook Iike shit, man.
Do you speak EngIish?
Maybe you got some kind of...
...IittIe demon inside of you these days.
How about that, doc?
You been Iosing sIeep IateIy?
Let me ask you, does it make it easier for you to taIk to me, seeing me Iike this?
Do you trust me?
Yeah.
I don't know.
I want you to trust me.
They onIy give those out on death row, paI.
You gotta be a stone kiIIer to wear that shit.
What kind of shrink are you, man?
You get away from me!
Get away from me!
Get away,
I'm not taIking to you, man.
You got that fucking thing on your arm. Get away! Get away!
Get away from me!
Two weeks and they haven't found the guy?
- I toId the cops, back off.
- Excuse me.
- Come on!
- You're hurting my arm.
Don't give me any grief.
- Is there a warrant?
- Judge signed it.
Get down to Forensics and check it out.
Hey, BiII.
What can I do you for?
I want you to run my prints.
- You want me to run your prints?
- Yeah.
Any past record I had wouId show up on the printout, right?
Sure. Why, you got some bIackouts you're worried about?
No. Just induIge me, wiII you?
Give me your thumb.
Jesus Christ.
Honey...
...what's the matter?
How Iong you been sitting here Iike this, hon?
I don't know.
Why can't you sIeep, honey?
I don't know.
BiII, come on. TaIk to me.
I think there's something the matter with me.
What?
It's the arm.
The arm's OK.
No, I think there's something wrong with it.
What are you taIking about?
I found out who it beIonged to.
You did? Who?
A vicious kiIIer.
Somebody who makes KoIberg
Iook Iike a...
Like an aItar boy.
Honey...
...you have this guy's arm.
You don't have his personaIity.
I don't know.
You know nothing about this guy, right?
Except his rap sheet?
You aIways say when you're confused, get more information.
Find out who the guy reaIIy was.
The differences between you and this creep wiII emerge.
I chose not to teII you about FIetcher, because I thought it wouId impede your recovery.
In the Iong run, scientificaIIy speaking, the psychoIogicaI makeup of the donor is irreIevant.
It's your arm now, not CharIey FIetcher's.
Yeah. WeII...
...that's what my wife says.
You shouId make a practice of
Iistening to her more cIoseIy.
Dr. Webb...
...you put a kiIIer's arm onto my body, and you didn't teII me.
I now have a murderer's bIood in my bIood.
I can't beIieve a man with your psychiatric background can be saying what you're saying.
That arm can't do anything you don't want it to.
- How do you know that?
- Listen, BiII.
Any physicaI probIems you have with the arm,
I and my staff wiII be thriIIed to heIp you with.
But as to these other matters you're bringing up...
WeII...
...I suggest you taIk to a good psychiatrist.
Thanks for your time, doctor.
Dr. Webb.
Mr. Draper is having some probIems.
I'II take a Iook at him right away.
Damn it, who is that?
What do you want?
I need to taIk to you.
You need to taIk to me?
What about?
About your arm.
My arm?
Yeah, I got the other one.
Yeah...
...so Iike...
...you want to arm-wrestIe, or what?
That arm used to beIong to a kiIIer.
OK.
You got my attention.
This is it, oId man.
Magic digit saved my Iife.
Death, transfiguration.
CompIete rebirth.
Best work I have ever done.
Best work anyone's ever done.
In this century anyhow.
You're a true beIiever in Dr. Webb, huh?
Agatha Webb is the most briIIiant woman I have ever met.
ProbabIy on a genius IeveI.
Darwin...
...Edward Hopper...
...WiIheIm Reich, EIvis PresIey and Agatha Webb.
I put her right up there.
This is CharIey FIetcher.
CharIey who?
CharIey FIetcher, the kiIIer.
KiIIed 20 peopIe.
With his bare hands.
With that hand that you paint with.
The arm that Webb sewed onto your shouIder, that...
That kiIIed peopIe.
Yeah?
WeII, what did he do with your arm?
Don't you wonder where these images come from?
If maybe they come from him?
Oh, Iook, paI,
I don't know what you do, but you sure the heII ain't no art critic.
Where do my images come from?
If you or anybody have a sound theory on that one,
I recommend you bottIe it and seII it at auction.
They just come to me, man.
I snatch them out of the air.
Thank God.
I want to show you something.
You see this?
For the Iast...25 years...
...I was a hack. I can say that now.
Dumb...
...Cape Cod Iandscapes.
WaII fiIIers for banks, hoteI rooms, that was the best I couId do.
Nobody had two seconds of their precious fucking time for my serious work.
I get this arm, and, hey,
I make $250,000 in the first three weeks.
My deaIer's phone never stops ringing.
The New York-fucking-Times is taIking about my ''searing, originaI taIent''.
I got no compIaints.
The worId is my fucking oyster.
I'm a 1 0-year-oId kid on the street corner fIying a red, white and bIue kite.
You hear what I'm saying?
This isn't art. This...
These, these...
These aren't your pictures.
This is...
These are CharIey FIetcher's pictures.
Don't you see? That's what he saw.
This, this right here?
This is what he saw when he was breaking a girI's neck.
That over there, that's what he saw when he kiIIed five poIice officers.
And this one right here?
This is what he saw when he was Iaying on the operating tabIe, and they were cutting him to pieces!
These are his pictures!
I know what I'm taIking about because I see these pictures in my mind!
You see those pictures in your mind?
Yeah?
You see this?
It's a paintbrush.
You see this?
This is paint.
Go ahead. Have at it!
Everybody's a fucking painter.
I'm sorry that you got a probIem with aII this, but, hey.
I'm busy.
The inspiration is on the fIow.
The bIuebird is on the wing, and I gotta catch it.
I gotta, see?
I'm working on my first miIIion here.
Nice taIking to you.
lt's childish of me, l know.
But l'm somewhat disturbed to learn
that l'm not the only beneficiary
of Dr. Webb's experiments.
l must find out if other
experimental subjects are...
...having the same
turbulent shifts in mood
and activity
that l've been experiencing.
Does the arm really have a soul
of its own?
These questions are...
...l know, monstrous and fantastic.
But what has happened
since the accident...
ls it not fantastic?
- Honey, we're Iate.
- Jesus Christ. What?
You scared the shit out of me.
What?
WeII, piss off. I'm not the one who said we had to go to this facuIty dinner party for the new
German guy in your department.
Oh, shit. I forgot aII about it.
If you think Iistening to a bunch of facuIty cIowns gossip is my idea of a good time, you've got another thing coming.
If you don't want to Ieave your bIessed study, Iet's not go.
Hey, hey, hoId on a second!
- What are you so angry about?
- What am I so angry about?
I don't know. What have I got to be so angry about?
Last night you scare the shit out of me about the guy who had your arm.
Today you bury yourseIf in here with your books.
What have I got to be angry about, huh?
OK. I'm sorry. AII right?
I'm sorry. There's nothing wrong.
I'm sorry. Everything's fine.
I taIked to Dr. Webb, everything's perfect.
You saw Dr. Webb and you didn't teII me?
Why shouId I? There's nothing wrong. Everything's fine.
I got this guy FIetcher's arm.
It's no big deaI. Who cares?
Everything's perfect.
- So it's OK?
- Yeah, it's OK. It's great!
He took five of my men.
Good ones.
I took him in.
The judge gave him the chair.
Then it kind of gets...
...hazy.
There's this Iady doctor who wants to experiment grafting techniques on convicts.
She's up to her neck in poIitics.
CharIey's got no famiIy.
No Iawyer. No money.
He's nobody.
She puIIs the right strings...
...and cha-cha-cha...
...you've got his arm.
I was in the operation room with eight armed officers when they sawed his head off.
End of story.
I'm home.
Hey! Where is everybody?
Hey!
- Dad!
- Hey!
Come here, you.
Damn it!
- BiIIy!
- Mom!
What's going on?
BiIIy, what is it?
What is wrong with you?
Are you crazy?
- I'm sorry.
- He's a chiId. You don't...
You don't hit a chiId!
Don't you ever put your hands on him!
Come here.
Mommy, what's wrong with Daddy?
That arm can't do anything
you don't want it to.
Go, go, go.
Go for a shot. Put it up.
Nice shot.
Hey, Mark!
- Pump it up, Mark.
- Yo, Mark, what's up?
Hey, guys.
- Hey, Mark, how you doing?
- Good.
- You positive you're up for this?
- I'm positive. Let's do it.
- OK. You're on my side.
- Hey, Mark, throw it here.
AII right, Iet's go. PIay it tight, now.
PIay it tight.
Come on, Iet's go.
- Bring it down.
- Man-to-man.
Watch that hoIe. Watch the zone!
- Watch the pick there!
- Get on him.
Go from the side. Go for it.
Let me have it.
Look around.
Harris, go for the boards, now.
- Hey, over here.
- Come on, Casey. Come on, now.
- Get at him.
- AII right. Go for it, Mark.
HoIy shit!
Yeah!
Jesus Christ!
What the fuck?
Oh...
You aII right?
- Huh?
- Yeah, I... I think so.
What happened?
I...
I don't know what happened.
Just, my Ieg...
- Fuck.
- Your Ieg?
What's the matter with your Ieg?
I don't know, it just kind of...
Just kind of stomped on the gas there.
And I couIdn't...
I couIdn't get it to hit the fucking brake.
- It sounds pretty nuts, huh?
- No, it doesn't.
Doesn't sound nuts at aII.
My name's BiII Chrushank.
Hi.
I know this sounds weird but I got my arm from the same pIace you got your Iegs.
- I'm Mark. Mark Draper.
- Hi, Mark.
Hi.
Mark, you aII right?
OK.
Can I taIk to you a IittIe bit?
Yeah.
Sure.
Listen, I, I...
See, I've been having some side effects from...
From this operation, and I just... I need to taIk to somebody who's been through the same procedure, you know what I mean? And...
WeII, my arm, it's kind of Iike...
It's been doing things on its own.
And, and something's wrong.
See, something's wrong with this operation. I don't know what it is.
It's...
...probabIy just rehabiIitation, you know? I mean, it takes a whiIe for it to come back.
I think that's what happened.
I just was having troubIe with my coordination.
Coordination? Mark.
Mark, I foIIowed you.
I, I saw you pIay basketbaII.
You Iooked pretty coordinated on the court there.
What's the matter with the car here, that's not coordination.
Hey, it was an accident, you know.
I mean, accidents happen.
Hey, Iook, I can waIk.
I had an accident three years ago at work.
It crushed both my Iegs.
Put me in a fucking wheeIchair.
Lose your Iegs sometime,
I'm teIIing you, aII your other probIems shrink to nothing in comparison.
Jesus Christ. Why...?
Why doesn't anybody want to ask any questions about these operations?
What are you taIking about, ask questions? I mean...
Look, aII I want to do is get good with these babies and get on with my Iife.
I suggest you do the same.
Yeah, aII right. AII right, Mark.
Yeah. OK.
Listen, I'II teII you what.
Here's my card, aII right?
Here. I'm sorry I bothered you.
If you...
No bother, it's just, you know...
I have to get on with it.
- Yeah.
- AII right.
Thanks for... Thanks for stopping.
BiII.
BiII. BiII.
Stop it.
Karen.
Get away from me!
Just stay away from me!
Stay away from me.
Wake up, honey.
Daddy, I'm asIeep.
Sit down here.
BiIIy. BiIIy.
Dad.
I was asIeep.
What's the matter?
Where's Mommy?
Daddy has to go away for a IittIe whiIe, guys. OK?
How Iong?
I don't know, BiIIy.
Daddy Ioves you guys...
...very, very much.
Why? Are you sad with Mommy?
No, honey.
Can I come?
No, BiIIy, you can't.
I want it off.
- Are you insane?
- I got serious probIems, doctor.
I hit my kid.
I tried to strangIe my wife.
I have nightmares every night!
Look, it's...it's OK, aII right?
The arm's fine. I don't want it.
Give it to somebody eIse.
Just give me a hook or something.
Do you reaIize what I and my team have accompIished with that arm of yours?
Don't you reaIize that if a gun were put to my head, I wouIdn't jeopardize the accompIishment that your surgery represents?
Can't you see this arm is kiIIing me?!
I'm sorry to put this so bIuntIy, BiII.
But the pain you're in just isn't that important when I baIance it against the significance of the experiment.
You won't perform the operation to remove the arm?
No.
And I'II see you put in a mentaI institution before I Iet you undo what I've done.
Let me be bIunt, doctor.
Why don't you go fuck yourseIf.
Get the heII out of this office.
Fuck you and aII your buIIshit!
I want this fucking arm off!
l don't know how
we got to be like this.
lt all seemed to go so well at first,
and now...
Now we can't seem to have a
normal moment with you around here.
lf only l hadn't signed
that damn piece of paper,
none of this would be happening.
The corollary of violence
is loneliness.
Humanity shrinks from the violent man
as if he were a carrier of disease.
Cut off from my family,
l'm terrified of what l am becoming.
l need someone
to share my sense of isolation with.
And yes, a growing sense of horror.
l'm alone...
...and afraid.
I reaIIy appreciate you guys showing up.
Every time I Iook at my hand...
...I keep thinking...
...about how many peopIe it's kiIIed.
How can one man kiII so many peopIe?
I'm having terribIe nightmares, you guys.
Look...
...I've had some probIems with the Iegs too, but I mean...
...just as soon keep them, right?
It's just pieces of this guy we've got.
Not his...
Not him, you know.
That's what I'm wondering, see?
I mean, where is eviI...?
Where does it Iive?
Does it Iive in the souI?
In the mind?
Maybe it Iives in the heart.
Maybe it Iives in the fIesh.
How can one man kiII so many peopIe?
Look, BiII.
You gotta stop torturing yourseIf.
Lay off the metaphysicaI specuIation.
It's a waste of fucking time, you know what I'm saying?
Maybe eviI Iives in the skin.
I don't know.
Look, why don't you taIk to Agatha Webb about this.
She knows what she's taIking about.
I mean, she's Iooked into these things.
She's spent her whoIe Iife on it.
She's gone to the mountain, man.
How come you guys don't have the same symptoms I do, huh?
I mean, why wasn't my transpIant a success Iike yours?
I mean...
She might be briIIiant.
You might be right.
Maybe...
Maybe it is me.
You gotta stop fighting it.
Go with the fIow.
Don't be so stiff.
Listen to what your arm's saying to you.
What's my arm saying?
Right now it's saying,
''Have another drink, oId buddy.''
Now, that's funny. Because that's just what my Iegs are saying too.
GentIemen.
I'd Iike to propose a toast.
To our benefactor, CharIey.
- To CharIey.
- To CharIey.
Thanks, Chuck.
Hey.
Hey, asshoIe.
I know you.
I've seen you on the TV news.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
Come on, Iet's see the hand.
It's just a hand, just Iike any other hand.
You wanna see mine too?
It's a matched pair.
I wanna see the one from the TV.
Hey, come on,
I ain't no circus attraction.
Yeah?
You're some kind of fucking freak.
I wish he hadn't said that.
Come on.
Let me see the hand.
- Back off, man.
- Come on, Iet me see that hand.
Take it outside, come on!
HeIIo, poIice.
This is L.B.'s Bar.
Get over here right away.
There's a fight going on.
Hey!
Move it. Move it!
Somebody get these peopIe out of here.
Come on, BiII.
Everybody get back.
What the heII is going on?
Get an ambuIance!
What is up here?
Come on, Iegs.
This is Bill Chrushank in exile.
Current location, the Hillcrest Hotel.
Well, enough about me.
How are you doing?
Leave a message at the beep,
and tell me all about it.
Hey, Bill.
Hey, Bill, it's Mark Draper calling.
Just caIIing to, just, you know, to see what's going on with you.
To see what's up.
I'm at home. Just...
- Mark?
- No.
No!
- HeIIo.
- Karen.
- Take the kids, go to your mother's.
- What?
Mark Draper's been murdered.
Now, just go.
Just don't pack.
Just go now!
Samantha?
BiIIy?
Samantha.
OK, Iift.
TeII me again.
You were home when you got his caII.
And you hadn't seen
Draper since the bar.
What was your fight about at the bar?
- We weren't fighting.
- It sounded Iike a fight to me.
- He was just trying to stop me.
- Stop what?
Listen, I'm tired.
- You got any more questions?
- Yes, I do.
BiII.
I'm sorry.
I'II have to start asking them downtown.
- You better check with Remo Lacey.
- What for?
Because I think his Iife is in danger.
Give me back...
You'II be safe.
From now on, you'II be with me.
I'm not safe.
I'm next.
It's CharIey!
What the heII's going on?
You son of a bitch!
- Hang on!
- Look out!
Oh, shit!
Turn right!
Right, right!
Stay on him!
- Stay with him!
- HeIp me, kid.
Shoot him.
Where's your gun?
Goddamn it!
Shoot him!
No. No, don't shoot him!
Don't shoot him, stop!
You son of a bitch!
- Son of a bitch!
- Get out of the fucking way!
Shit!
Go Ieft! Go Ieft!
Shit!
Give me the gun,
I'II shoot him!
Shit.
Dearest Karen,
This may be my final journal entry.
Having read this,
you know the truth.
l hope you understand why
l have to do l what l'm about to do.
l love you, Karen. You and the kids
are the best thing l've known.
Bill.
WeIcome, BiII.
You wanted to give back
CharIey's arm? We're ready to take it.
You're compIeteIy out of your fucking mind.
You're a threat to every
Iiving thing you touch.
The grafting on of Iimbs was onIy the beginning.
The beginning?
Saving CharIey FIetcher's head so he couId run around and kiII peopIe?
That's quite an achievement, doctor.
Science, Iike nature, destroys to buiId.
I'm part of a process that's bigger than aII of us.
Now we transpIant heads...
...with fuII brain chemistry and functions intact.
Don't you see where this can Iead?
Yeah.
Straight to heII!
Fuck you.
Get me Detective Sawchuck.
Homicide.
- Homicide.
- This is Chrushank.
I'm over at the cIinic.
CharIey FIetcher's dead.
I've got Dr. Webb here.
You better get over here.
As l sit here today, the only survivor
of Dr. Webb's experiments,
l feel somewhat resigned.
The questions l've been asking
are quite simply beyond my reach.
Where does evil live?
ls evil in the flesh?
lf a tree falls in the forest,
and nobody is there to hear it,
does it make a sound?
lnquiring minds want to know.
And life goes on.
l do know that evil
does not live in my arm,
because since Charley has died,
l've experienced
none of the violent tendencies
the arm initially manifested.
l've adjusted and accepted
the fact that l am the recipient
of a miraculous
new surgical technique.
And to that end,
l owe Dr. Webb and Charley.
The arm's mine now, Chuck.
l won it, fair and square.
You're not Ieaving those
Iast Iines in, are you?
Sure.
I thought you said it was gonna be pubIished in the Journal of Medicine?
It is. I just thought
I'd inject a IittIe humor.
WeII, then it's briIIiant.
- You think so?
- The rest of it ain't so bad either.
I Iove you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry?
Sir, she's breaking out!
What are we looking for?
She jumped over the fence!
A couple of trains came through here about the time she escaped.
Do you think she could have gotten this far in that time?
Is she that fast?
She is that fast.
And this too.
- Three dollars and ten cents?
- Your change.
- Thank you.
Can I help you?
The total is $ 17.95.
Here's your card.
Are you gonna buy those?
Have a nice trip.
It's brown tweed bag, like a duffel.
Do you see it anywhere?
- Sir, it's not here.
- The porter said he put it on the cart.
This is the cart.
There's no bag here.
Government authorities said it was the largest earthquake to strike...
He's riding Greased Lightning.
That was Shorty Kincaid.
Enjoy the view.
Excuse me.
We shouldn't be seen together.
Father hasn't been dead long.
Do you think Arlen suspects?
No. It's not too soon for us to be together.
Tickets.
Are you traveling by yourself?
You're 12?
Someone meeting you in Los Angeles?
We'll say you're 11.
Then you only pay half price.
Our little girl did this?
She's not a little girl.
DNA typing and material found in those wounds proves it was her.
She could be anywhere. Chicago,
Las Vegas, Los Angeles, anywhere.
We should stop the trains.
And have the railroad and police ask questions we can't answer?
We'll put key personnel at every stop along these lines.
I want a team to track her.
Hunt her down.
- Good morning, Jill.
- Hello.
- Thanks for taking care of my cat.
- We'll take good care of him.
I won't be gone very long.
Take care.
Bye-bye.
Are you still having problems with the people at work?
They point their finger at me saying...
...I'm the weird one,
I'm the strange one.
Why? Because I have feelings?
Because I feel?
There's someone at the door.
I won't answer that. Whoever it is can come back at the end of the hour.
That's for me.
Sorry to interrupt.
We need your help, Dan.
I know.
Gotta go.
Mr. Fitch will be with you all in just a moment.
Well...
I guess we all must be here for the same reason...
...whatever that is.
I'm Dan Smithson...
...and I don't know why
I'm here either.
But they said they needed me and it was important, so I came.
What do you do, Dan?
I'm an empath.
Sometimes they show me awful things people have done.
I try to tell them why they did it.
What qualifies you for that?
I feel things deeply, that's all.
What am I feeling now?
You wanna believe that nothing affects you...
...that you're not afraid of anything.
But you're curious...
...just like the rest of us.
Stephen Arden.
Harvard Anthropology Department.
Expert at cross-cultural behavior.
Laura Baker. Hi. Molecular biologist.
And who are you, and what do you do?
Preston Lennox.
And if I'm here...
...the shit has hit the fan.
What exactly is your area of specialty, Mr. Lennox?
I'm a freelance solution to our government's problems.
What exactly might they be?
The kind people don't usually like to talk about.
You hunt people, don't you?
I guess so.
You in here? It's a little late for Tv.
You in here, honey?
Good evening, I'm Xavier Fitch.
I'm in charge of this operation.
Would you sit a little closer, please?
In November of 1974...
...a small group from S.E.T. I...
...S- E-T-I, Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence...
...used radio dishes at Arecibo...
...to send a message to whoever was listening.
They sent a quarter of a kilobyte...
...including structure of human DNA...
...a map of our solar system...
...population of the Earth.
Helpful facts like that.
In January of 1993, Arecibo received a message back...
...from an extra terrestrial...
...unknown source.
That's great.
Intelligent life beyond this planet?
Yes.
There were two communications.
The first message turned out to be a superior catalyst for methane.
We now have the potential...
...to produce infinite energy from this clean-burning fuel.
This convinced us we were dealing with a friendly intelligence.
The second message turned out to be a new sequence of DNA...
...with friendly instructions on how to combine it with ours.
Here's some technical data.
Get feedback from Dr. Baker.
Basically...
...the new combined
DNA sequence...
...was injected into 100...
...human ova.
We got 7...
...to divide.
Four petered out.
Two were stored in liquid nitrogen.
And we allowed one to grow.
Its code name is "Sil."
That's after 2 hours.
One day.
Two days.
- My God.
- This growth is amazing.
A week.
- It's a girl.
- Yes.
We decided to make it female so it would be more docile...
...and controllable.
- More docile and controllable, huh?
Well, I guess you guys don't get out much.
That's her 1 month after she was born.
So you kept her caged in there?
It was safer to keep her isolated.
She didn't like being locked up.
She didn't like being alone.
Didn't she?
She's hiding something.
Something inside.
You're right, Dan.
This is three months after she was born. Watch carefully.
What the hell was that?
Back the tape up.
Watch her eyes.
Rapid eye movement.
She's dreaming.
- She's having horrible nightmares.
- It's some kind of anxiety reaction.
Got me a little anxious.
It made the research team a little anxious too...
...so the decision was made to terminate the experiment...
...to run more research to see what we were dealing with.
You were going to gas her?
That was the decision.
It makes you feel mad.
You feel mad that you had to kill her, don't you?
I don't know.
Yes.
Yesterday the body of a transient was found in a boxcar near Salt Lake City.
Preliminary DNA tests conclude...
...he was killed by our creation, by our Sil.
Found any other bodies?
- Not yet.
- You will.
She's a predator.
Her eyes are in front...
...so she can judge the distance to her prey.
That's right.
Where'd you learn that?
I saw it on the Discovery Channel.
I caught that show myself.
- Mr. Lennox.
- Yeah?
As the...
...non-scientist amongst us, are you clear about what's going on?
I think so.
You created a monster...
...with a formula you got from outer space.
The damn thing got away. Now you want us to hunt it down and kill it.
Now, is that pretty close?
I guess.
You don't want us...
...to capture her alive so that we can study her?
Laura, I think this is strictly a search and destroy operation.
Nobody ever asked me to find anything they didn't want dead.
I'm sorry for you.
Yeah, well...
Thank you, Dan.
I'm sorry for her.
May I have your attention, please?
Welcome to Los Angeles. This is the terminal stop for the Desert Star.
All passengers please disembark.
Something bad happened here.
- No shit.
- Crushed her larynx.
She was afraid.
She's scared, frightened.
Hungry too.
She's been eating like a horse.
Our girl is definitely not on a diet.
She's storing calories for something.
Any ideas?
Oh, my...
Well, that's...
That looks like some sort of...
...chrysalis. Some kind of cocoon.
What are we looking for, a giant moth?
If that is a cocoon...
...she'll be fully-grown now.
- Fully-grown.
Maybe that's how she got by our people.
They were looking for a child.
She is a child.
It stinks in here. I'm going outside.
Get the conductors' ID and credit card numbers on your computer.
There's no sign of them on the train.
- Let's assume she took them.
- I'll see to that.
She kills if she's threatened.
And she has no remorse about it.
None.
Of course, Los Angeles is perfect for her.
It's a city of the future.
Anything goes.
Totally mobile population.
Everyone's a stranger.
Very little is taboo or unacceptable.
Whatever she does, no one will notice her.
Well, whatever. So...
Los Angeles is where the battle will be fought...
...and won.
You look very pretty.
Do you have a hundred?
Here we are.
Be more careful with your money.
Not everybody's as honest as me.
Are you foreign?
Do you speak English?
- Yes.
- Here. You keep this.
Here, let me take this.
Be careful here.
Yes.
Watch your step.
Our laboratory, Visitor Base One...
...is being moved to some empty virus research labs at the university.
They're moving our equipment now.
It'll be operational by 8:00.
Check into your rooms. Everyone out front in 15 minutes. We'll go over.
What will we do?
Process the evidence from the train.
Could we try growing this creature with its own DNA?
We do a version without ours this time and investigate its vulnerabilities.
That'd be good.
- Then I could know how it feels.
- Makes sense.
This human life form could be a mask.
Without the camouflage...
You're right. At least we'd know what we were dealing with.
A couple of bozos just ran out.
I got a customer.
- Yes, young lady. Can I help you?
- I want a room.
62, including tax. That'll just about cover the Honeymoon Suite.
Hi. Come here often?
What's your sign?
Tired of brunette?
Change.
Change the color of your hair.
Color-Tress.
I've increased the magnification.
When I pierce the cell, the foreign DNA will be introduced.
Shit!
The camera's gone down.
Excuse me.
Do you have a replacement camera?
We do, but it'll take time for the technician to replace it.
No. This happens in my lab all the time. It's simple to replace it.
You saying you can do it?
Sure I can. I just need somebody to give me a hand.
I don't want technicians in there.
This is classified.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
- Man of action, I like that.
- That's me.
Can you get that one for me?
Give me the camera.
Something's... Something's wrong.
Christ, It's started already.
- It's started. Get the top back on.
- What?
Laura, Press, get the top back on.
Here you go.
She must have penetrated the cell.
- Shit.
- What was that?
He dropped the bolt.
- Find the bolt. Get the top on.
- I'm looking, Fitch.
Can they hear me in there?
Laura, Press...
...get the top on, then I'll let you out.
- Where'd it go?
- It fell through the grate.
- Can you lift it up?
- It's not gonna move.
- This isn't going anywhere.
- No, can't get it!
- Press...
...you gotta get the bolt!
- Can't get it. The floor's welded down.
- Oh, my God.
Press. Oh, my God.
- I've never seen anything like this.
- Holy shit.
I can't let them out.
- Press, look.
- Come on.
Fitch, let us out of here!
Open the goddamn door!
- Not until I know what's in there!
- Open it now!
- Let them out.
- I can't!
- Open up the fucking door!
- Let us out!
- Tell me it'll stop growing, Dan.
- It's not, let them out!
Open up the door!
Press, Press.
What the fuck is that?!
Laura, get to the other door!
- Let her out, Fitch!
- I can't!
- Let her out!
- I can't!
- You motherfucker!
- Let her out!
- You've gotta let them out!
- I can't hold it in!
Get out of the way!
I'm gonna burn it!
Out of the way!
- What is this thing?
- In 2 minutes, I'm burning the room!
I have to do it!
You have two minutes to kill it.
Disconnect the gas line.
Use it as a flamethrower.
Laura, watch out!
- Where'd it go?
- In the pipes!
- Open the door!
- Shut up, Dan!
One minute remaining.
Laura...
...it stopped moving. I think I killed it.
It's dead! Open the door!
It's dead, Fitch. Let them out.
Oh, God, it's not dead.
- Shit.
- What'll we do?
30 seconds remaining.
- There's not much time. Let's go.
- Open the door!
- Let them out.
- I can't do that.
- I have to follow protocol!
- What protocol?!
The protocols by which we're doing this!
You didn't tell them that before they went in.
- Fitch, let them out.
- Twelve, 11, 10...
- Fitch, let them out!
- I must follow protocol.
Let them out, Fitch!
Go. Get out of there!
Three, two, one.
- I had no choice.
- Yeah, sure.
The protocol is to burn the room if anything went wrong!
Where's a good place to find a man?
There's plenty of guys at the Id around the corner. It's a club.
You won't have trouble meeting somebody there.
Thank you.
You can't miss it.
Look for the long line.
I need your credit card...
...for room incidentals, long distance calls and so forth.
Credit card? Zip zap?
American Express, Visa,
MasterCard?
There you go. Thanks. All right.
Thank you.
Wait a minute!
You don't want this falling into the wrong hands.
No.
Here's Justin Crawl. It's through and it's covered by the goalie.
Yeah?
The conductor's credit card turned up...
...in a Hollywood motel.
The van's out front.
Let's go.
You two.
Enjoy yourselves.
You, legs. You're in. Go on.
Where are you from?
- I'm foreign.
- You're what?
- I'm foreign.
- Really?
Easy, easy.
I've got a party to go to and no one to take me.
I'll take you.
- You will?
- Yeah.
Okay. I'm going to the little girls' room.
Wait right here.
I'll be right back.
I'll be right here.
Whatever it takes, right?
All's fair in love and war.
Can't see much on that.
Get this tape to the lab. Enhance it.
See if we can get a better look.
She looks nice.
Do you have any idea where she went?
- I'll find her.
- She wanted to meet a man.
I suggested a club called the Id around the corner.
Get the tape.
I've got a party to go to and no one to take me.
Where is this party?
I don't know.
Whoa, you can't park there!
Back that out!
- No, you can't go in there.
- What's going on?!
- There's been a murder!
- No one leaves here! I mean, nobody!
There's always some action in this part of town.
Blue-eyed blonde.
Black leggings, pink sweater, 5' 10" tall. Who'd she leave with?
Blonde leaves with a guy is hardly news around here.
Name the top attractions. No losers.
Assume he's socially adept.
He'll be helping her out.
A friendly guy, not an asshole.
I'm thinking.
- Robbie left with a blonde.
- That's him.
That's him.
Come on. Let me show you the rest of the house.
I'm still sweaty from that place.
It's so crowded.
Like it?
Yes.
I feel like a shower.
You want one?
Tell you what.
I'm taking one.
You wanna take one later...
...no problem.
Take off your clothes.
I want to see you.
Very nice.
Take me back.
What are you talking about?
You know why we came here.
I've changed my mind.
All right. You said "no."
It's duly noted. Come here.
I wanna go!
Too late. You're not leaving!
You're not!
- All right.
- That's better.
What's happening? Kills a girl at the club, kills this guy.
I'd say she fits the definition of a psychopath.
Nothing inhibits her.
No moral sense, no social structure.
She wasn't exactly smothered with a mother's love or taught good manners.
I asked what was happening.
He did something, she was angry.
She'll kill if she's threatened or if anyone gets in her way.
Of what?
Her life cycle.
I think she's trying to mate.
Reproduce.
Okay.
So why did she kill the girl?
Sexual competition.
She's hard on the competition.
Now she managed to mate.
Doesn't look like a success.
He's still got his pants on.
- She's frustrated.
- Who isn't?
What's her problem?
She was here with him.
Maybe she rejected him.
She probably has special senses.
Rats can sense diseased or genetic damage in their potential mates...
...so we can test his body...
...for hereditary diseases or defects that would make him a loser...
...essentially.
Needles.
Maybe he was a doper, or a diabetic.
Either way would make him unacceptable. Excuse me.
All right.
Insulin. Diabetic.
There you have it.
She could have just walked out.
Why kill him?
He pissed her off.
Some men, when rejected, get insistent.
- Put an APB out on his car.
- We have.
We'll go back to the motel.
I want to check it out.
More docile and controllable, huh, Fitch?
- What do you think, Dan?
- What do I think?
I think she'd want to be alone now.
She won't come here with all these cars outside.
You're assuming she could find her way back here.
She could.
What is it?
Maybe menstrual blood.
If she's menstruating, she can reproduce.
Yes, I know.
Shit.
Oh, Jesus.
Excuse me.
Call a paramedic! Anybody got a phone?
If your commute takes you westbound on the 10 freeway...
...expect an hour delay.
The drive will be slow to Malibu.
The video enhancement is not that great.
How old do you think she is?
Twenty, 23?
Her reproductive system should be fully developed.
Her biological clock must be in hyperdrive.
She wants a baby.
If she has a child our problems have just begun.
If her offspring is male and develops at the same rate as Sil...
...it could reproduce in 6 months.
God knows how many females it could impregnate.
Fitch.
When a predatory species is introduced...
...into a closed ecological system...
...the extinction of the weaker species is inevitable.
They found the murdered guy's BMW, out of gas in Santa Monica.
What's her name?
- I don't know.
- Who are you?
She didn't have any ID.
I thought I'd make sure she was okay.
You think she's got insurance?
I don't know. Just put it on my credit card for now.
And you don't know her name.
Guys like you are hard to find.
Get a lab workup on that, stat.
Get her up to x-ray.
I want an x-ray on this.
It looks like a scapula fracture.
Your shoulder wound.
What's going on here?
Doctor, we need you now.
A child burn victim just came in.
- What is going on here?
- Doctor, please.
Jesus Christ!
Did you see her shoulder?
Please. We need you immediately.
You're okay.
I'm okay.
I was sure you were seriously injured.
I'm okay.
You are. It's a miracle.
Can we go?
Did the doctor say you could go?
Yes.
We'll send somebody over there.
Thanks a lot.
Doctor over at Parkbay Hospital called in with some weird story.
We should check it out.
It's a few miles away.
Laura...
...Press, take a car, check it out.
- Parkbay Hospital?
- Yeah, Parkbay.
She walked.
She walked.
She walked that way...
...not too long ago.
Got some fruit and cheese.
What is that?
You mean the hot tub?
A hot tub.
I love this place.
It's away from the traffic and business and people.
Sometimes it feels like you're not in L.A. Anymore.
Here.
We'll immortalize the moment.
Look at the camera.
- This girl literally reformed her bones.
- It's her.
Who checked her in?
I don't know. Let's find out.
She had no insurance so this guy put it on his own credit card.
Here's the file. John F. Carey.
You don't have a driver's license or home address?
No, sir.
Just an imprint of his credit card.
Give us a printout of what you've got.
No problem.
Some candy?
It's in the Palisades and he's got a phone number.
Tell Fitch where we're headed, and try to get John Carey on the line.
I'd better get the phone.
I've got his machine.
Should I leave a message?
Yeah.
Tell him he's about to copulate with a creature from outer space.
- Copulate, huh?
- Yeah.
I like you.
I know.
It's not too soon for us to be together.
No, it's not too soon.
You don't need these.
Hey, hey. That's a little fast.
What's the matter?
Take it easy.
Just relax.
There's plenty of time.
What is it?
I think someone's at the door.
Don't go.
Please. I want a baby.
What?! Excuse me?
Let's go around the side.
Outside.
- What happened?
- A squirrel! A fucking squirrel!
- She was here.
- Yeah, she was.
I wanna make sure she's not still here.
Perhaps we should check the body for evidence that they've had sex.
I used to be scared at the sight of blood.
Now I guess I'm getting used to it.
Oh, yes.
- Help me, please!
- Oh, my God. What's the matter?
We found this in the living room.
She liked him.
Well, not enough.
Can't see any more on that than we did on the video monitor.
He didn't get a good picture of her.
There's no evidence of semen in the hot tub water.
Maybe she took it with.
So she probably hasn't managed to mate.
- We interrupted her.
- Yes, I think we did.
Give me something I can use.
What have you come up with lately, Fitch?
She's not scared of us.
That's for sure.
We're all beat.
We'll go back to the hotel and rest.
Tomorrow night...
...we'll go back to the club.
- Stake it out.
- Stake it out.
She's not stupid.
She won't repeat herself.
There's no point going there.
It provided a poor specimen.
I'm not sure.
She's been in the city two days.
It's what she knows.
I'd rather try the club...
...than sit at the command center reminiscing about how close we got.
She would make one excellent biological weapon.
If someone thought we were some kind of galactic weed that would...
...spread through the universe.
So what you're saying is that...
...she's the cure and we're the disease.
That's well said.
"Baker, Laura.
1735 Meander Drive,
Simi v alley, california."
That's you, right?
Last time I checked.
What do you do for kicks out there?
Pine for guys like you.
That's what I thought.
So anyone hungry?
No, thanks. I'm beat.
I'm gonna try to get some sleep.
- Good night.
- Yeah. Night.
- I'll have something to eat with you.
- Thanks, Dan.
- Do you ever have nightmares?
- Yes.
Please untie my hands.
- I wouldn't hurt you. Please.
- I have them.
I think they tell me who I am.
Why are you doing this to me?
I don't know why I'm here.
I don't know who I am, who sent me.
- Do you?
- No!
- Why do you think you're here?
- I don't know.
Please let me go.
Please. Please, let me go.
I wouldn't hurt you.
I promise.
- I wouldn't hurt you.
- Yes, you would.
You just don't know it yet.
No, I wouldn't!
Please!
My hands are hurting me.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, no!
No! No!
Laura and Press, they like each other.
They just don't like to show how they feel.
What?
Laura and Press, they like each other.
Yeah, whatever you say, Dan.
Look, it's really smoky in here.
I'm gonna go outside, get some air.
Think I'll lie down in the van. Have a rest. This is a complete waste of time.
Get a feeling you're on a wild goose chase?
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Get out of here. This is my trashcan.
It's you.
Hey!
She's here! Hey!
- Dan. Is that her?
- Yeah.
Here.
Get in the van.
Everybody get in the van!
They're heading into the hills.
We'll need the helicopters.
We're going up Nichols canyon. One of you try to block her at Mulholland.
Watch it!
Oh, my God!
We blocked the road.
We've gotta tell the press something.
Tell them what you want, just don't tell them the truth.
I don't buy her showing up at the club. It's too damn convenient.
Seeing is believing or don't you trust your eyes?
Get back! Get all these people back!
Fitch. Fitch. It doesn't feel right.
Sir!
We found a severed thumb in one of the doors that got ripped off.
- Let me see that.
- She may have caught it in the door.
Get to the lab, see if it's hers.
- It'll be genetically identifiable.
- It's all over, everyone.
Tomorrow you can go back to your lives.
Congratulations on a job well done.
Just like that, huh, Fitch?
I don't think so.
Leave me a message.
And Frank, I'm going to dinner.
Where are we meeting?
Bye, sweetie.
Waiter.
Well, I guess we won.
- We won, science lost.
- I didn't think we'd get her this way.
- Not that easy.
- You sound like you'll miss her.
I guess I will.
I think I respected her.
I know this was a hellish job, but I really enjoyed working with you three.
And since Uncle Sam is buying, let's have another round.
Waiter!
I don't... I don't drink.
Don't worry, Dan. Tonight you will.
You wanna dance?
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you.
- All right.
- Okay.
I know you don't have a family.
Do you have a girlfriend in New York?
I guess I've had a few, but they don't hang around very long.
I guess I keep too many secrets.
You wanna share one with me?
- Right now?
- Yeah.
I know what you do, and it doesn't scare me.
- Really?
- No.
Well, it does most people.
I wouldn't wanna never see you again.
- Hey.
- What are you...?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I thought you were somebody else.
I'm sorry.
You okay?
I thought it was Sil.
I saw the blonde hair.
She's dead, Press.
The tests on the thumb proved it was her.
You got your test and I got my gut.
I just don't buy it.
I think as long as you feel she's out there, you got a mission.
Maybe you don't want this job to be over.
Well, maybe not. So what?
Thanks for the dance.
Good night.
What do you call this?
It's called a Long Island Ice Tea.
It's got tea in it?
Nope.
Smells nice, can I try some?
Help yourself.
Does it work on your boyfriend?
Yeah. As a repellent.
I don't know. I think he's in remarkably good shape for a man his age.
One Long Island Ice Tea.
I like these cups of tea.
- What?
- That's great.
Hey, give me one of those.
I like these cups of tea, man.
You guys, I'm tired.
I'm gonna go to bed.
So?
She's going to bed.
I guess.
She still...
...wants to see you though.
Maybe I'll go find out if you're right about that.
I'd hate to be in here during an earthquake.
Yeah.
What floor do you want?
Ten, please.
I like your perfume.
You do?
- Thank you.
- Excuse me. I get out here.
Good night.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Did you want something?
- Maybe.
- Maybe?
Housekeeping.
Dan. Dan.
Those two over there.
Bet they like unusual men like us.
Women think I'm strange.
I don't feel well.
Don't be silly.
Just go over there and talk to them.
I have to go. And I think you should leave with me, okay?
I'm gonna stay for a while, actually.
Okay.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Housekeeping.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I was sitting over there, wondering...
...what two intelligent, glamorous women were doing without dates.
My name's Stephen Arden.
I teach anthropology at Harvard.
- I lived in Boston once.
- Yeah?
For a year.
- Froze my butt off.
- It's cold in Boston.
This is Bill and Tony.
I forget your name.
Cute little socks.
Stand up.
How'd you get in here?
- I stole the key.
- What?
I saw you downstairs, but you were with all those people.
So I thought I'd come up and wait.
This kind of thing doesn't usually happen to me.
I just want to be with you.
Oh, yes.
What about protection?
She's here. She's here.
Press?
Someone's at the door.
Who's there?
Press, Laura.
It's Dan. I gotta talk to you.
Christ, what does he want?
- What's the problem, Dan?
- I just got this terrible feeling.
I get this strange thought, this image of Sil with Arden.
Sil's next door with Arden, Press.
No, no, no. She's dead, Dan.
I went to his room and there's someone in there with him.
- Did you knock on the door?
- Yes, but I don't know what she'll do.
They're making a lot of noise.
They're having sex.
I know it's Sil, I know it!
Okay.
I believe you. I'll get dressed.
I enjoyed that immensely.
- I felt it.
- What?
It's started.
What's started?
Life.
Oh, my darling girl.
In some cultures, women believe they know the moment of conception...
Don't you believe me? Feel.
Holy shit!
I hope you're right about this, Dan.
- She's headed for the basement.
- We'll take the stairs.
Laura, come with me!
Come on!
If she's pregnant, we gotta get to her before she gives birth.
God. We don't know what we're dealing with here.
She could have a dozen babies.
She could lay 1000 eggs!
Oh, God. Did you see Arden?
Yeah, I did, that poor bastard.
We can trap her. The fire door opens from the inside at the bottom exit.
Then what?
Holy shit.
- Oh, my God.
- The bitch went through a steel door!
Fitch! Dan! We're in the garage!
She got past us!
- You saw her?
- She was gone before we got here.
- Here.
- You saw her!
- Look at the door!
- Which way did she go?
- Where's Press?
- He took off down that tunnel.
She kills if she feels threatened.
She kills if she feels threatened.
She must've come through here.
She went down here.
There's no other way.
Yeah, she's down there.
Let's go.
Stand back, I'll clear it out.
Which way did she go, Dan?
- I don't know.
- What?
I'm not sure. She's here.
Think. You're supposed to have some extrasensory power! Which way?
- Which way did she go, Dan?
- I don't know! I don't know!
- I think she went that way.
- That's good enough for me.
You think she went that way?
You don't fucking know, don't you?
You don't fucking know.
I'll go this way. You come with me.
- Come with me, Dan!
- Fitch.
I think she went this way.
Dan?
Dan?
Fitch. Fitch.
Dan?
What happened?
I can feel her.
She's that way.
She's that way.
I never thought
I'd want to kill something.
Never thought I'd want to.
It's this way. It's back here.
Hey, she went in here.
This must have opened up during the earthquake.
Okay, stand back.
Is that oil?
Looks like it.
I'm going back there to see if I can flush her out.
If she comes back through here, let her have it.
Dan. Dan!
- Dan, what is it?
- I don't know.
I don't know.
Dan.
Okay.
It's okay.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
You come here.
Come on. I got you.
Press, something's happened to Dan!
You okay?
Shit!
Dan?
Dan?
I'm stuck!
I need your help! I'm stuck!
Dan, you gotta hang on!
Press!
Dan, keep on.
Press!
Hang on, Dan!
Hang on!
I got you.
I got you, Dan. Hang on.
Shit.
Hang on!
Hang on, Dan!
Get rid of her, Press!
Duck your head.
Let go, you motherfucker.
- I got you. Hold on, I got you.
- Shit.
I thought I was dead.
I thought you'd drank your last Long Island Ice Tea.
Yeah, I thought we all had.
Hey, you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
My pants are a little messed up.
But I'm okay.
She was half us, half something else.
I wonder which was the predatory half.
The dead half.
Let's get the hell out of here.
I never thought I'd be so happy to be back in a sewer.
The year 2078.
A mining colony on planet Sirius 6B.
For 50 years, the New Economic
Block, the NEB Corporation, -
- has controlled mining throughout the known solar systems.
20 years ago, on Sirius 6B, -
- the NEB discovered the solution to the energy crisis. Berynium.
But mining berynium unleashed lethal doses of radiation and pollution.
"The Alliance", a federation of mine workers and scientists, -
- demanded mining be stopped.
The NEB 's reponse was to declare all-out war.
This conflict has fuelled a new cold war on Earth, -
- but so far the fighting has been confined to Sirius 6B.
Massive NEB bombing raids have devastated this beautiful planet.
Thousands have been killed by deadly berynium radiation.
Now, in the tenth year of the war, the survivors on Sirius 6B -
- are faced with a new threat beyond imagination...
- Okay, ante up.
- Five.
Okay, I see your five.
- Back in the slammer.
- Those were my last smokes.
This game sucks.
This whole place sucks.
Lieutenant, I think you'd better have a look at this.
What the hell is he doing here?
Tell the captain we've got a situation. A NEB coming in.
- How did he get this far?
- I'm going to take him.
He's mine.
- What are you waiting for?
- Something's not right. He's alone.
Here comes the cavalry.
No matter how many times
I see this, it still makes me sick.
I'm glad those things are on our side.
Our side's the good side, right?
Tell me again, iùs a little blurry.
We created them.
We didn't have any choice.
Without the screamers we'd have lost the war.
- Is the NEB still out there?
- Yeah, but not in one piece.
Just the one?
What the hell was he doing out here?
He had something in his hand that he wanted to show us.
Well...
I guess I'd better take a look.
Are you going out there?
Thaùs a great plan.
Iùs probably some kind of bomb.
Get off your butt and open the goddamn door.
Check your tabs, sir.
CRUCIAL: TO ALLIANCE COM MANDER
- Who wrote this shit?
- Mozart.
- "Don Giovanni."
- Don Giovanni?
What the hell do you want, Chuck?
Tear your eye away from that coin, and I'll tell you.
Iùs the portrait of a sphinx.
It belonged to Augustus Caesar, the first great emperor of the world.
Riddle me this, Caesar. We haven't seen a NEB soldier in six months.
Why does one solitary grunt get shredded by a screamer -
- trying to hand deliver this?
Priority seven. You and me... and
God, if he's still paying attention.
I doubt it.
- Is it a trick?
- I couldn't get into it, either.
- Don't do that!
- Scared you, didn't I?
Jesus!
"From Marshall Richard Cooper,
Fifth NEB Army Command."
"To Joseph Hendricksson.
Matters of extreme urgency."
"Demand immediate peace negotiation."
"Request two officers.
Safe passage guaranteed."
"We await your arrival ASAP."
- Peace negotiation.
- They sound pretty desperate.
- We've been waiting for this.
- What have we been waiting for?
The end of the war.
Maybe iùs another bullshit tactic to get us to lay back.
- MacDonald, are you there?
- Yes, sir.
I want the following message transmitted to San Francisco.
Have received first contact from NEB army in six months.
They wish to open peace negotiations. Please advise.
We picked up an emergency message from a commercial transport.
We're 5 million miles off of the shipping lanes.
Find out what their emergency is.
No clearance, no landing.
Joe, what do you make of this?
Looks like a map of the forward command post.
- They're laying themselves open.
- So why the pony express?
They've been completely silent for two weeks. Not even radio.
But why just one guy?
Why not a patrol?
- Secretary Green is arriving.
- Thank you, MacDonald.
Joe, Chuck, I have some very inspiring news for you all.
Alliance HQ has been keeping it classified. Wrapped up tight.
The NEB Corporation has approached us requesting an armistice.
We could actually end this war.
Reserves of berynium have been found on Triton 4.
After extensive testing, there's no sign of radioactivity.
We are on the verge of signing a world peace agreement.
We'd also renew contracts with the NEB to mine on Triton 4.
These negotiations are extremely delicate -
- and we can't afford to do anything that might upset the apple cart...
- Sorry, sir.
- Fix it.
- There's radiation interference.
- Give me the damn thing.
Morse code was better than this virtual reality shit.
It is imperative to make no contact with NEB Command on Sirius 6B.
I'm sure you won't do anything that would jeopardise our chances now.
Peace, can you believe it?
The NEBs are businessmen.
Now they're mining on Triton 4, peace is in their interest.
- Thank God for Green.
- He's a good man.
He prevented a war on Earth.
A war on Earth mighùve done them some good.
If those assholes rolled around in the mud.
- Which assholes?
- NEBs and us.
- We were all NEBs once.
- Exactly.
I just want to go home.
Whaùs the first thing you'll do?
I've got no plans for the future.
- You have a lot to look forward to.
- Income tax.
Are you going to look her up when you get back?
- What for?
- You tell me.
She couldn't take it.
She's married and moved on...
...and I'm still here.
Not for long.
Do you still think about her?
It used to be every minute, then once a day.
About twice a year
I get a kick in the chest.
What did she look like?
All personnel. Radiation alert!
Please light your reds.
I left mine in the office.
Have you got one?
He must have been a brave man... that NEB soldier.
Alert!
All personnel to their stations.
- They're not civilians.
- No, a troop transport. All ours.
- How bad is it?
- No survivors.
- Then what the hell is that?
- Get me out of here, man!
We're going to cut you out of here.
Just hang on.
"Sirius 6B Transportation."
We've got no transportation service!
- What the hell is that?
- You've got to look at this.
- Look at this.
- And this. Iùs a bomb factory.
Holy shit!
A nuclear reactor!
- When did we last see one of these?
- Whaùs happening here?
Come on.
- Careful. Are you all right?
- Calm down. I'm all right.
- Get this man a tab.
- What the hell's a tab?
- This guy's naked here.
- Hold on a second.
One second!
I'm out of here.
DEPT. OF DEFENCE
REVISED
You wanted to see me, Commander?
Yeah.
At ease, we're informal around here.
Thaùll be all, Rodgers.
- How are you doing?
- Good... there's a scar on my arm.
If you go outside without a tab on, you'll lose your arm. Name?
Private Michael Jefferson.
Gunnery specialist on six levels.
First class.
Level six? You can shoot the dots off a dice at 100 yards.
If you can load it, I can shoot it.
Instructors used to call me "Ace".
- Everybody here calls me "sir".
- Yes, sir.
- Sir, what are they?
- Iùs a sword. Take a look.
Screamers were developed to neutralize the war on the ground.
- How do you know iùs dead?
- I yanked its brain out.
- Thaùll take your finger off!
- You said it was dead.
It still has a mechanical surface reflex.
They get shot up, but can still swing a sword. Pretty smart.
Maybe too smart.
It seems to have modified itself.
Where's everybody else?
The guys who were with me?
- How many men onboard?
- 38, including me.
Now there's one, including you.
Those guys...
I didn't even know them.
I couldn't even talk to them.
Jefferson... what in the hell are you doing here?
There was a nuclear reactor aboard programmed for weapons manufacture.
- I wasn't aware of that.
- You radioed you were civilian.
- Where were you bound?
- Triton 4.
Why were you carrying a nuclear reactor and weapons?
To invade, attack and extinguish the enemy.
- What enemy?
- The NEBs.
You were going to attack the NEBs on Triton 4?
Yes... but we're just a task force.
4,000 Alliance Army regulars are on their way to Triton 4 right now.
- Secretary Green informed us...
- Secretary Green?
- Thaùs right.
- Secretary Green is gone.
He's been gone for almost two years.
We got a V. R. Communique from him yesterday.
Secretary Green was arrested and eliminated by the Alliance command.
Two years ago.
Dismissed.
- I enlisted to fight...
- Dismissed, Jefferson.
- The NEBs have been running...
- Get out of here!
What in GoÔs name are we doing, Chuck?
- We just saw Green.
- We saw bullshit!
You know as well as I do that they can send us anything they want.
- That kid doesn't know policy.
- Get your head out of the lilacs.
Do you expect me to believe that we're being dumped?
That our 20-year stand here has turned into a galactic gold rush?
They keep sending us provisions.
Will they let us die up here while they carry on running the universe?
- I don't buy it.
- Wake up, man!
We are betrayed here, brother.
We are beached.
Green's been shit-canned and this whole place is a lie!
They just can't cut us off up here.
Families on Earth would raise hell.
And they won't take us back there.
If we sound off about this, nobody's going to fight their war for them.
They're just going to let us roll on and on up here.
We ain't ever getting off here.
Marshall Cooper and his NEB Command knows it, too!
He sent us a map.
Your solitary NEB grunt got his ass shot to stop this thing.
They know iùs pointless now.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to NEB Command.
We'll make our own peace right here.
NEB said they wanted two men.
Somebody's got to stay here in case anyone else falls out of the sky.
- I'll take Johnny Gung-Ho.
- The kid?
I'm not risking any more of our men.
This is your tab.
It won't work for anybody but you.
That makes me feel a lot better.
Screamers only attack living things.
They read your pulse rate.
Your tab broadcasts a false heartbeat, flat-lining you.
In theory they work perfectly, but radioactivity corrodes them.
- What then?
- We thank God you're a good gunner.
I was remembering that day up in Point Reyes.
- That bartender...
- With the monkey.
The beach. We sat drinking beer, watching the humpbacks blowing.
You watched the whales, Joe.
I was watching other things.
We should go back there.
I'd like to see that again.
What, girls volleyball?
Hey, Joe...
I'll see you soon.
On that day. Jefferson, are you coming or are you breathing hard?
Good luck.
Cicero, this is Libby.
Radio check, over.
Cicero reading you loud and clear.
Next transmission will be 33:00 and then every 4 hours after that.
If I miss one, don't sweat it.
If I miss two...
...move into the office, change the music and carry on.
I'll take the office, but the
"Don Giovanni" will have to go.
Roger, copy.
- The air is terrible out here.
- Iùs whaùs in the air.
- What, radiation?
- This'll neutralize it. Here.
- Iùs an anti-radiation red.
- Thaùs what poisoned it?
That used to be the most profitable, wonderful enterprise in the galaxy.
It produced berynium. The answer to the worlÔs energy question.
A spoonful could take you from
Earth to Saturn in a day.
Then those mines started puking up tons of radiation.
We thought we'd discovered gold... but we discovered shit.
And you smoke this shit just to neutralize the shit in your lungs.
- How do you know iùs working?
- If you don't die.
- God! What happened here?
- Blasts.
- NEB bombers.
- They nuked the civilians?
The civilians got in the way.
The bombs were aimed at us.
You just don't have a clue about what brought you here, do you?
You'd fight for any son of a bitch if he convinced you you were right.
- Someone convinced you.
- Not someone, something.
The Alliance was formed to support you.
You're right, Jefferson. And it divided my country and my world.
So as much as you're dying to get shot by some NEB soldier, -
- we're going to make peace with these people, you and me.
We're going to rip you off of that experience.
Look at this place.
I came here 20 years ago to mine berynium for the NEB.
We were all NEBs then.
The scientists found radiation and shut down the mines.
The NEB Corporation threatened them, and there was a stand-off for years.
They they started to rain everything down on us.
Nuclear disc bombs, chain bombs, bacteria crystals.
Civilian survivors were evacuated.
We retreated to the bunker.
- How did you fight back?
- We reinvented an early weapon.
- The sword?
- The autonomous mobile sword.
The screamer.
Save it.
They don't eat rats, do they?
We're not sure.
They're scavengers and they learn.
They use everything. Rotting meat gives off methane gas for fuel.
Maybe eyeball jelly makes good blade wax.
Are they machines? Are they alive?
I don't understand...
I don't have the answers, Jefferson.
- But where are they coming from?
- Underground.
The first design was sent to us from the Alliance on Earth.
Iùs all automated now.
No one's been down there since they pushed the first button and ran.
- They make themselves now.
- And no one knows how?
They're down there breeding like rabbits and no one knows?
Am I speaking Swahili?
Thaùs exactly what I mean.
Hit the dirt!
Come out of there!
Come out of there!
Come forward.
- Stop.
- Can I come with you?
My God...
- Cover me.
- Go.
Jefferson.
You all right? Iùs okay.
What have you got there?
Let me see.
Thaùs a good guy.
No, you keep him.
Thaùs your friend.
Where do you live?
- In there?
- Yes.
In the ruins?
How many are you?
How many people?
- You're alone? How do you survive?
- Food.
- What kind of food?
- Different.
How do you keep away from the screamers?
- The blades underground that kill.
- I hide.
- Can I come with you?
- No, you stay here.
Give me a macro-ration.
We'll give you something to eat.
We'll come back for you.
In two or three days we'll find you.
Take this.
You tear this and eat it.
- I want to come with you now.
- We'll come back in two days.
You take care of this guy, okay?
We can't just leave him here.
He's a kid. He'll never survive.
- What am I saying?
- Can I come with you?
- Whaùs your name?
- David Edward Dearing.
- Where's your mum and dad?
- They died in the blasts.
You've been alone here for four years?
Everything seems to be okay.
Is it safe to make a fire like this?
We want to let them know we're coming.
- Fire keeps the rats away.
- Rats?
I had this friend, he used to eat them. Rats.
You'll appreciate this...
You don't just heat up the oil, that makes them stick to the pan.
You get the pan hot, put the oil in cold, then add your rats.
But don't crowd the pan, it sucks all the heat out.
You keep flipping them, or they burn.
- My friend said...
- Jefferson!
You must be confusing me with somebody who gives a shit.
Give me that rock, boy.
Cicero, this is Libby calling.
- Come in, Cicero.
- Libby, how is it out there?
Iùs cold.
We're at 14 degrees north latitude.
We expect to reach the NEB Command...
...in about four hours. Hello.?
We've got a new arrival.
He came in yesterday.
Chuck, you're breaking up.
You'll get your next transmission at 00:00 hours.
- Libby, over.
- It seems a little strange...
If you're gonna be a rock, be a rock. Don't be a bug.
Don't do that to me!
I nearly pissed my pants... sir.
Things ain't what they used to be.
Jefferson!
- Didn't you hear it?
- No.
- Good God, man!
- Cool, huh?
- Do you know how much they cost?
- Keep that on your wrist.
- Doesn't it work if iùs nearby?
- It stays on your arm!
I'm already dragging one kid around.
Do I have to tie your shoes for you?
Your tab was on and it was going for you.
What is this?
I've never seen this.
It looks like an animal.
Iùs not an animal.
Iùs an upgrade.
- Maybe iùs a NEB one.
- Jefferson, relent.
We're getting out of here.
Take your bear with you.
- Where are we going?
- A long way for you, kid.
You soap the socks the night before.
The water dries out but the soap stays in.
- You've got soap against skin...
- Have you got a dimmer switch?
If you put a teddy bear in a microwave, nothing will happen.
- But a wet frog...
- Shut up.
Jefferson!
Goddamn screamer!
It wanted to kill us.
It can see us and touch us.
I can't tell what the signals say.
It can talk.
- He's a fucking toaster.
- Thaùs right.
Pinocchio's not a real little boy.
- Why didn't it try to kill us?
- It was tagging you.
They're smarter now. They get into our bunkers. They tag along.
Who can resist a kid with a hard luck story?
Once it gets inside, the killing starts. But you knew that already.
- You brought him in here.
- It found us.
What is your reason for being here?
We were invited here for a peace negotiation.
Marshall Cooper sent this from NEB headquarters.
You want to negotiate.?
We ain't gonna do it here.
- Are you taking them to the bunker?
- You got something better to do?
- Sir, do you trust these guys?
- No.
- What are you doing?
- Calling the office. Problem?
Cicero, this is Libby. Come in.
- How is it out there?
- We've got a new kind of screamer.
- I can't hear you real well.
- Iùs a kid. A little boy.
- Don't let it into the bunker.
- I can't hear you.
There's too much interference.
That kid, he was like a person.
How did he know what to say?
You think Santa makes them his little elves?
They've got more brains than you.
Fighting won't solve our problems.
One of those kids tagged my patrol.
We took him into our bunker.
- Nobody got out.
- Except you.
- Whaùs that supposed to mean?
- You figure it out.
You guys brought them here.
Only after the bombing started.
But now they don't care what uniform is covering your ass.
- Neither do I.
- Slow down, soldier.
- Neither do I.
- Slow down, soldier.
Would you mind taking that outside?
Stray bullets are bad for the inventory.
Iùs worth a lot more when it ain't all shot to... shit.
I'm letting you stay here out of the kindness of my heart, Becker.
So follow the ground rules.
First, no gunplay inside.
Second, this is my place, and nobody touches anything.
Real Scotch, not synthetic shit.
No spitting.
Spare a cigarette?
Well, gentlemen...
Live it up.
I haven't had an American cigarette in over a year.
There's plenty back at base, but I forgot to bring them.
- You got the last one.
- Very generous of you.
What is this place, a commissary?
There hasn't been a commissary here in over two years.
Not since those blades arrived.
- Are you a freelancer?
- Right. Black market, Commander...
Hendricksson, Joseph. San Francisco.
Jessica Hanson, Pittsburgh.
How do you do?
- Iùs early in the day for that.
- Yeah.
I'm looking for Marshall Cooper,
Fifth NEB Army.
He'd be in the command bunker, if there still is one.
What about your communication satellites?
If they're still working, they'd be in there, too.
What do you mean by that?
You have no idea of the hell you opened up.
We opened up? Just tell me where the command bunker is.
You wouldn't last ten yards out there without me.
- Have you seen it?
- I heard it.
- Hordes of them.
- What hordes?
Davids. I heard them screaming into the bunker above us.
I heard the soldiers screaming.
Then it got very quiet.
Nothing... except the smell of death.
- Still want a guided tour?
- If Cooper is alive, I'll find him.
I'll take you to Command.
We'll go underground.
- I want something in return.
- Speak.
- I want off this ashtray.
- Where?
Earth. How long do you think
I'm gonna last in here?
Nobody leaves. The NEBs and
Alliance are fighting on Triton 4.
They've hung everybody on this planet out to dry.
Good Lord, you're beautiful.
I can take you back to the Alliance bunker.
- Deal.
- Going somewhere, Jessica?
She's taking me to NEB Command and I'm taking her to Alliance.
Cosy.
And then what?
Become a prisoner of war?
You can relocate anywhere if you can get off this globe.
Or you can go straight to hell for all I care.
You're crazy.
You don't know whaùs down there.
- Afraid of the dark, Ross?
- Get off my back.
Look at this. Iùs one of ours.
She's got everything.
And I found something else.
- What is it?
- A plutonium rocket.
Plutonium? Have I been blowing smoke out of my ass?
We've not used nukes in this war yet and we're not going to use them now.
So leave it.
Okay, leùs get on the good foot.
Anybody thaùs coming, come on.
"When he's best, he's little worse than a man."
"And when he's worst, he's little better than a beast."
I never knew they put
Shakespeare in comic books.
Ain't it sharp enough yet?
Iùs never sharp enough.
I'm not sure if these tabs work, but stay close to me and Jefferson.
Leùs go.
This leads to the maintenance tunnel underneath the command bunker.
I ain't going in there.
Don't tell me a big guy like you is scared of mice!
- Has a rat got your tongue?
- Get off my back.
Is that all you know how to say?
Explain your vocabulary, Ross.
Knock it off!
Just get off my back!
We're almost there.
This is the command centre.
This is the ground level.
REDISCOVER PARADISE ON
SIRUS 6B
- What the hell is this?
- Iùs exactly what you think it is.
I knew it!
We're all gonna die!
Jefferson, if that man moves, or even farts, shoot him.
Shut up.
If Richard Cooper were alive, he'd be here, wouldn't he?
The ComSat stabilizers are all frozen.
This one's free.
Uplink attempt initiated.
Sat Net downlink does not respond.
Malfunction.
Sat Net does not respond.
Way to go, Ross.
Can I come with you?
Jefferson, get everybody out of here now. Do it!
Go.
AUTONOMOUS MOBILE SWORD
TYPE 1 REVISED
Can I come with you?
AUTONOMOUS MOBILE SWORD
TYPE 3
IDENTIFY TYPE 2
Can I come with you?
We're not leaving without Hendricksson.
Can I come with you?
- Can I come with you?
- Jefferson!
Cute, Jefferson.
It won't take them long to get through this door.
- Thanks for waiting, Becker.
- Yeah, next time.
There won't be a next time.
That was stupid.
- What was so important back there?
- What other type?
David was a type 3.
The reptile was a type 1.
Whaùs the other type?
Can I come with you?
Iùs a... type 2.
- Genius. You can count up to three.
- Get off my back!
- Iùs a wounded soldier.
- "Help me. Help me."
There were only a few reported.
We thought you'd discontinued them.
- We've never seen them.
- What do they look like?
- Who do they look like?
- Look in the mirror, Ross.
I'm warning you... just get off my back.
They keep saying the same thing over and over.
Just get off my...!
Exactly.
He's one of them.
He's a machine. Type 2.
He kept repeating himself.
You heard him.
And what about the scotch?
You saw, he didn't take a sip.
Thaùs right, sir.
We offered, but he refused.
Thaùs blood.
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit? Take a look.
I see a human being who got wasted for no reason at all.
- What are you looking at?
- That wasn't very human of you.
Until two days ago,
I didn't even know you existed.
You think I'm one of them?
Then you'd better kill me, too.
See if I've got any switches inside.
Come on, be on the safe side.
Do it!
Man, I'm out of here.
Anybody thaùs coming, come on.
Cicero, this is Libby. Come in.
Cicero, this is Libby. Come in.
If you get killed, will your man let us in?
Not if he's smart.
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
Well, I'm not.
It was a mistake.
I'll kill you before I let you make another one.
Just got out of basic training, didn't you?
Iùs pretty obvious you're a rookie.
You think you're the centre of the universe, but you're not.
We're just insignificant little specks, you and me.
We're not gonna change the world.
We're not gonna win the war.
Nobody's gonna care that we die.
"Which many signify that you should snarl and bite and play the dog."
- Not me.
- Shakespeare?
Very good.
Cicero, this is Libby. Over.
Cicero, come in. Over.
Goddamn radiation!
Come on, we've got to get closer.
- Come on down.
- We're right in front of the door.
- Come on down.
- We're right in front of the door.
- Come out. Over.
- Bad connection, Joe.
I've got NEBs with me.
Come on up.
You're breaking up, Joe.
- Come up out of the bunker.
- Come on down, Joe.
You come up, Chuck.
- Chuck, thaùs an order.
- Come on down. Over.
- Chuck...
- Come on down. Over.
- Let me speak to Don Giovanni.
- This is Don Giovanni.
Come on down. Over.
- This is your old pal Wolfgang.
- I will open the door. Over.
I'm coming down right now.
Do you copy?
- Come down. Over.
- I'm coming in... Go!
Watch the flame.
- Give me the nuke!
- What?
Give me the mini-pluto you stole out of the bunker!
- Loading.
- Watch your heads.
Hang on!
Help me!
Help me!
- Help me!
- Sir!
Help me!
- Sir.
- I'm okay, Jefferson.
- What about you?
- Becker's down. He's wounded.
Becker...
- He's wounded...
- Hold on, man.
Wounded.
- Help me.
- Jefferson! No!
Down! Down to hell!
And say that I sent you there.
"I came into the world with my legs forward."
"And the woman cried,
'He was born with teeth!"'
I had no father.
I am my own father.
I have no brother
I am my own brother.
This word love, which old farts call blind, -
- be resident in men like you, asshole, but not in me.
I am my motherfucking self. Alone!
Jefferson!
We're gonna die.
You know that, don't you?
Yeah...
...but not today...
...and not here.
Where will we go?
Where do you go when there's nowhere else to go?
Home.
Earth.
Earth.
There's an emergency escape vehicle for use by the commanding officer.
Iùs hidden in these mountains in a place named ironically -
- for where they developed the first atomic bomb. Alamogordo.
I've never been there.
- What are you talking about?
- There's a way off this planet.
- Type 2?
- Hell if I know.
I've never even seen this tag.
I've never even seen this language.
Can I see it?
Yeah.
God! I'm sorry.
Give it to me. I'm sorry.
I had to know.
No! Don't do that... you don't need to.
- Thaùs the last one.
- Iùs okay.
According to this we should be close.
- Does that locator work?
- Yeah.
- Is it up there?
- It should be.
- I don't see anything.
- Thaùs the idea.
I can't go on any more.
I don't want to go on any more.
Listen to me. I don't have anybody.
I don't have a family or a friend or that kid Jefferson.
I don't even have him.
But I have you, do you hear me?
I have you, and we're going home.
I'm taking you home.
BERYNIUM WAS DISCOVERED HERE
ON JULY 16, 2064.
When I took over command, this was coded in my bio-signature.
- It only works for you?
- We'll soon find out.
- It only works for you?
- We'll soon find out.
Then I'm with the right guy.
- What do we do?
- I have no idea.
Leùs try this chair.
What about this?
Elevator activated.
Countdown to launch commencing.
Iùs moving. Get on.
Hang on.
The crane's blocking the trajectory.
- I'll be down.
- Okay.
Please clear launch pad.
Gantry inoperable.
Circuit malfunction.
Launch sequence initiated.
Time to launch: 15 minutes.
- Chuck!
- Remember that bar at Point Reyes?
I guess you'll never see it again.
We all die alone, Joe.
Like the new look, Commander?
What do you think?
Is this me, or what?
I liked the other face better.
Do you know who I got it from?
Marshall Richard Cooper.
Name ring a bell?
Do you know how we got it off him?
Just like your buddy Chuck, we ripped it off.
He was screaming something about God and Jesus.
You're in the wrong place.
I took his face.
He didn't have much use for it.
But I like your face better.
"She couldn't take it. She married and moved on, and I'm still here."
Obstruction cleared.
Prelaunch proceeding.
Down to hell, and say that I sent you.
"I came into the world with my legs forward..."
- Are you all right?
- Fine. Leùs go.
- Prelaunch sequence complete.
- Joe...
- Damn.
- One seat. One life support system.
Get in. We've got eight minutes for you to get out of here.
- You know how to fly it.
- Iùll fly by itself.
Shit!
I'll flip you for it.
Call it. Heads or sphinx.
Rome, Egypt.
I'll flip it. You call it.
All right, Cleopatra, I'll call it.
Rome.
It doesn't matter. You're going.
Now, go.
I can't...
Pardon me, gentlemen, would you mind taking that outside?
Stray bullets are bad for the inventory.
Jessica Hansen, Pittsburgh.
How do you do?
We can smile, we can cry, we can bleed.
We can fuck.
I wanted to tell you. I did.
Not so fast.
Two minutes to launch.
Hey, bitch!
Prelaunch burn complete.
90 seconds to launch.
I didn't want to...
...go back with you. I was afraid.
I know. You were afraid of what you would do.
You're coming up in the world.
You've learned how to kill each other now.
I learned something else, too.
I learned to...
...love.
30 seconds to launch.
This is Joseph Hendricksson aboard EEVT 3. Over.
Alliance San Francisco. Over.
On a prelaunch, requesting emergency clearance for Earth.
Cleared for Earth. Over.
Hi. How you doing, sweetie?
Come on in.
I already prepared everything for you... just the way you like it.
Jeez, it's so hot tonight.
Are you ready?
You want me to play dead?
Do you want me to die, honey?
Please. Please, let me die for you.
Why did you close the windows?
You know I don't scream.
What are you doing, honey?
Is there something wrong?
What's that?
You're hurting me!
Get off! Oh, God!
Please, help me!
What do you know about the killer?
We know he's a male, probably aged...
Is there a possibility there's more than one killer?
No comment.
- You sound confident.
- I am.
- Do we know the killer's race?
- Not definitive.
We are analysing skin samples taken from underneath the fingernails of the victims.
Results will help to determine the killer's race.
Is it true the police aren't interested in finding the killers because the victims were prostitutes?
The suggestion that we're not treating this case diligently is not only false but offensive.
We've already spent
1,800 man-hours on this case...
What do you know about the killer?
I can't tell you all that we know, but he's male...
- You got the job. That job?
- Yeah.
Jesus.
That sounds disgusting.
Don't you think? Don't you think it's just disgusting?
All I gotta do is sit on my ass all night and read a book.
- You're drinking too much.
- He's already very drunk.
I think one person is responsible for these crimes.
- Why do you say that?
- That's my business.
That's all I got to do.
I just got to sit on my ass.
Sit on my ass!
Inspector.
Is it true the police aren't interested in finding the killers because the victims were prostitutes?
The suggestion that we're not treating this case diligently is not only false but offensive.
- Is there more than one killer?
- My feeling is one killer.
- Do you know the killer's race?
- Not definitive.
We are analysing skin samples taken from underneath the fingernails of the victims.
Results of those tests...
- Is there more than one killer?
- No comment.
Staying over tonight?
- Do you want me to?
- Do you want to?
If you want me to.
Marie, if I've ever done anything to make you happy, I truly apologise.
These markings could have occurred after death while the body was...
Sources have confirmed that the victims were sexually assaulted after their deaths.
Is there more than one killer?
It's gotten so hard to talk her into things.
She's become less and less... receptive.
- When will the results come in?
- Soon. Maybe tomorrow.
That guy's supposed to be amazing.
- We can't tell the public every...
- Receptive to what?
Were the victims sexually assaulted?
What do you think of the killer?
I think his time is running out.
Katherine!
Katherine?
I'm in the bathroom!
What?
Nothing.
You had strange dreams last night.
I did?
You were breathing really heavy.
You kept kicking your legs and moaning.
- You sure we weren't having sex?
- Pretty sure, yeah.
- Call me and tell me how it went.
- Yeah.
- Good night.
- Night.
Mr Johnson?
Mr Johnson.
- How did you get in?
- The front door was open.
Damn door never closes.
So, this is you?
- Oh, yeah, this is me.
- Welcome to Mars.
- Sorry?
- They weren't kidding you.
About what?
I'll leave you the coffee machine.
The radio is mine.
- You got a radio?
- No.
Get yourself a radio.
What did they tell you exactly?
Not a lot.
Now there's very few people around, but at night, this place is like Mars.
- So, what have you heard?
- Pardon?
What exactly did they tell you about me?
- Nothing. They told me nothing.
- Come on. They told you why I quit.
No, honestly, not at all.
May we come in?
Turn the key till you hear the click.
It registers on a piece of punch tape verifying you were here every hour.
- I see.
- Do you?
Thank God we don't need to check this room. The key's outside.
Come, have a look.
It's all right. Come on.
- You know what's in those tubs?
- No. What?
Smell the formaldehyde.
You can smell it, can't you?
You should never go in there. Never.
I never have.
Disgusting.
- So, I'll be alone here at night.
- Didn't they tell you?
Sometimes, an ambulance or police comes in, but apart from that, it's just you... and them.
The morgue.
I don't know why they put a key in there.
The hell with it.
Let's get on with it.
Just keep your eyes on the key.
Just keep looking at it.
Don't look at them.
Damned idiots. Why in the hell did they put a key in here?
What are the cords for?
Just a precaution, in case one of them wakes up.
- If you pull it, the alarm goes off.
- Wakes up?
Then you call the duty doctor from the guard's station.
He'll be here in five minutes.
Don't worry. It'll never happen.
It's cold in here, but you can still smell 'em, can't you?
Yeah.
Make sure the door doesn't close.
No handle on the inside.
- Why would it close?
- And turn out the lights.
This is where it happened, supposedly.
What?
Some years ago, scandal, terrible scandal.
Night watchman.
Many years ago... he did it.
- He did it?
- Did it with them.
- You mean...
- The guy had his very own harem.
Well, I never knew anything about it firsthand, but the rumour was, they caught him doing it.
They hushed the whole thing up.
Who knows? Lots of weirdos out here.
God.
I'm not a weirdo.
After you've worked here a while, your breath'll begin to stink.
You can test it by holding your hand up to your mouth and breathe.
Am I right?
Oh, Jesus! You're right.
Goes with the territory.
Nothing you can do about it.
These are the staff files.
We're all in here somewhere.
Dead ones, over there.
Staff, over here.
Meaningless.
Here's your duty roster.
You'll come on at eight, be relieved at four.
- Is that the alarm from...?
- It'll never happen.
Have you got a radio?
- Actually, I'm gonna study.
- Get a radio.
- Like I said, I'll get a radio.
- Good.
Who is that picture of?
I don't know. It's always been there.
Oh, one more thing.
There's nothing to be afraid of, but...
I think it'd be a good thing to have.
And then the radio...
It'd be a good idea to buy yourself a radio.
OK.
You have a choice of seeing two movies.
One, 90 action-packed minutes of two heroes spending time together having these incredible adventures.
The other movie has 45 minutes of one hero having incredible adventures and the other 45 minutes is a guy sitting at a desk, reading a book, OK?
Which one do you go see?
Who's playing the guy reading the book?
There is definitely loss of consortium, but how about mental anguish?
- What happened to us?
- What?
I can't breathe in here.
Why the fuck are we here?
- Getting older.
- We're dying.
- Same thing.
- No, no, no.
You know this movie
I was talking about?
The two heroes start challenging each other.
- Really?
- Yes. The one who backs down loses.
Why would they want to do that?
Because they're dying and they wanna play before they end up in bed with the establishment.
OK, so what are the stakes?
If I lose, I marry Marie.
You lose, you marry Katherine.
What?
- Why?
- It's some fun!
You are totally insane.
No, I'm not.
Shit.
Shit, the lights.
Weren't you afraid?
No. No. And then I saw these tubs.
There was something in them.
Spare parts.
I saw shadows or something.
I don't know.
That's really sick.
You're dead. What's it matter what someone does to you?
I just think it's sick, OK?
I have to go to the bathroom.
Yeah, I'll go with you.
So, listen.
Yesterday,
I'm down in Camden near Hyde.
I see this very attractive-looking girl standing at a bus stop, right?
But I notice she doesn't get on any of the buses.
So?
Come on, counsellor.
She was a prostitute.
Seventeen years old. Joyce.
How do you know all that?
Excuse me, those are my quarters.
I got the next game.
- Tough shit.
- All right, I'll get the manager.
I'm gonna go get Satan.
- It's OK.
- Sure?
Yeah.
Let us just play one game then you guys can play, all right?
Why you look so scared?
I'm just kidding. You all right?
What did you do to him?
Shake my hand.
I'll just play one game, OK?
I'm sorry.
Damn, baby.
Do fries come with that shake?
Please, get out of my way.
Maybe we should do something, huh?
Let me know if you're interested in nine inches.
I'm very interested in nine inches but not in fucking you three times to get it.
Such nasty things coming from such a pretty mouth.
Where you going?
Did I hurt your feelings? Bitch.
Hi. I hope our little altercation didn't interrupt your beer-drinking.
We were just discussing if we should do something.
- Let's go.
- No. We're gonna stay.
No, we're not.
I didn't mean you and me.
I meant me and Martin.
Just a little while.
- Assholes.
- I hope you know what you're doing.
You know, if this was the movie and you were playing the exciting guy... you'd go over and show those guys up.
James. James.
James!
Four, quadruple, Jack.
- What are you doing?
- Getting ready.
- For what?
- You challenged me.
I take it back.
We're not in grade school.
You can't take it back.
James, don't...
Excuse me.
Hi. I wanted to thank you.
What in the fuck is you talkin' about, fool?
I wanted to thank you. You know how long we've been looking for you two?
You're not telling me I'm the first person to approach you about this?
I'm serious. You guys are gonna be on talk shows forever.
- Talk shows?
- Oprah, Phil, Sally. You name it.
You like Ricki Lake?
What the fuck are you talking about?
When I say we've been looking for two guys like you, I mean it.
- No one's approached you about this?
- No, nobody's approached me.
That's unbelievable.
Un-fucking-believable.
You go on these talk shows - and there'll be a lot, you're gonna be on the road for weeks.
These guys will ask the same opening questions.
Maybe we should run through it now, just so you're prepared, huh?
OK.
Yeah? All right, great.
It's a multipart question, so answer carefully.
Now, we know for certain that your parents communicated through a series of clicks and grunts.
What we wanna know is how and when did you acquire the facility of speech?
All right? Were you the only one in your group to exhibit this facility?
And when did the majority of your body fur fall out?
Answer the third part first.
Sure.
Come on back. Let's play some pool.
Where you going?
- Non-verbal communication...
- You motherfucker!
- Let's do it. Come here!
- You can't be domesticated.
God! Did you see their faces?
That was great!
"When did the majority of your body fur fall out?"
Did you see them?
- Fuck!
- You all right?
- Goddamnit.
- Are you hurt?
Let's get out of here.
You know, I fucked her.
Who?
The hooker, Joyce. I fucked her.
You fucked a prostitute?
Jesus, what was it like?
It was fascinating.
She did everything I asked.
Everything.
I'd say, "Stand over there," she'd say, "Yes, Martin. "
I'd say, "Lay down," she'd say, "Yes, Martin. "
What?
- I told her I was you.
- You said you were me. Why?
How would she know who the fuck you are?
Back at the bar, you were excited by that.
It was a rush. You felt good.
You felt alive, didn't you?
- Yeah, sure.
- I didn't feel anything. Nothing.
A year ago, I would've felt like you.
I would've felt hyped up, flushed.
But, it's like my tolerance is increasing and I can't get that feeling any more and I have to get that feeling.
I just don't get that feeling and I need it.
I have to, too.
Do you?
Challenge me.
- OK, do it with Joyce.
- What?
- Do it.
- Yeah, yeah!
Come on. What, do you think this is just for fun?
And we invite her out, OK?
- Katherine.
- Katherine will never know. Come on.
Find an excuse, OK? Friend?
Buddy?
OK.
You told her you were me? Fuck.
Why do you have to rehearse in the morning?
Alan likes morning rehearsals.
- Yeah? Well, that guy's a moron.
- Well, he speaks highly of you.
Like I said, the guy's a genius.
- Come on. You know I can't be alone.
- You can.
You got bad breath.
Call me tonight.
You'll be asleep.
Wake me.
Shit.
- Did I scare you?
- No.
I'm sorry. Inspector Cray.
Martin Bells.
- You new here?
- Yeah.
- Law school?
- Yeah, yeah. Last semester, I hope.
That's fascinating for some reason.
It has something to it.
He's dead and he's going to die.
I think his name was Louis Paine, if I'm not mistaken.
Sitting on death row, waiting.
We could really use one right now.
- A death row?
- No, a murder.
Wait a minute. There's been another?
They're bringing her in now.
- Have you been in there?
- No.
- You should have a look.
- Nah.
No, you should. Otherwise you'll just be haunted here working at night.
Nothing cures a fantasy like a quick dose of reality.
You think so?
Go on.
OK.
Are you all right?
It was just feet. Just feet.
Yeah.
I've been meaning to ask what they do with them.
By the way, I saw you on TV.
Yeah? How was I?
- Are you on to him?
- We're getting closer.
How do you know it's just the one guy?
- Can I trust you?
- Well, yeah, absolutely.
Can I trust you with a bit of privileged information?
- Yeah.
- He has a signature.
- Signature?
- He takes their eyes.
- Good evening, guys.
- This one just quit smoking.
Deputy Inspector Bill Davies, this is the new night watchman.
- What's your name again?
- Martin Bells.
Deputy Inspector Bill Davies.
Bill, Bells. Bells, Bill.
Most people, when they see something like this, their immediate reaction is to ask,
"How could somebody do this and why?"
Even when we catch the killer, they want to know the how and why.
In movies or television, the killer always explains the how or why.
He always has some reason, however crazy. A mad gleam in his eye.
I've interrogated murderers like this one before.
Let me tell you, they are well beyond the need to justify what they do.
They just do it.
Explanations are just a fiction to make us feel safe.
Because if it can't be explained, then it's just meaningless chaos.
It could touch any one of us at any moment.
Which is exactly what it is.
I would have been sick.
I have a high tolerance for that stuff.
I still think it's weird.
- Why?
- You don't think it's weird?
Why shouldn't I see the body?
I work there.
How do you know it's the same guy?
Some of us just know.
What is that supposed to mean?
Nothing. I'm sworn to secrecy.
- Come on.
- I can't tell you.
Wait a minute. You can't tell me?
Katherine, you wouldn't want to know.
Believe me.
Jerk.
- Duty nurse.
- This is night watchman from 03.
- The alarm just went off.
- The alarm?
The alarm from the morgue went off.
- What was that?
- The alarm from the morgue.
- Oh, well...
- Well?
You should just go and check it, then.
The doctor will be there in about 30 minutes.
What! But what if it...?
Just go down and check it out and find the defect.
What if it's not a defect?
Don't worry. It is.
You crazy bastard! You're insane!
What the hell are you doing?
- Who do you think you are?
- I couldn't help it.
- I almost had a heart attack.
- But you didn't.
Christ, I almost shit myself!
How the hell did you get in here?
The front door doesn't close right and you're buried in that book.
I stood and watched you for five minutes!
You scared ten years off my life.
I called the duty doctor.
They're gonna think I've gone crazy.
You know, it's a really beautiful place you got here.
It's cosy!
I talked to Joyce.
Remember, your name is James.
I can't handle any more of your ideas.
All you have to do is show up.
I promise.
Dress nice.
Like I'm gonna tell Katherine
I'm dressing nice to study with you.
Tell her that we're studying opera.
Figaro. Figaro. Figaro.
You're a fucking nutcase!
That's Mr Fucking Nutcase to you, pal!
Kje kej je
It was my fuckin' alarm clock.
I'm sorry. What a shock.
- Can I offer you something?
- Excuse me?
Have you ever spent any time with the Zine family?
What?
Thorazine, Stelazine, Compazine...
No!
They're really very nice.
They will make you sing hymns while you watch a baby fall under a train.
No, thank you. I'm fine. Thanks.
Listen, we don't have time for screwed-up kids.
Just don't freak out again.
OK?
Those'll kill you.
Thank you.
She's probably not coming.
Impatience is an early indicator of boringness.
- "Boringness"? That's not a word.
- Here we go.
Joyce. Friend to the working man.
Good luck, James.
Oh, my God. Oh, Jesus.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- I'm Joyce.
- I'm James.
Good evening.
Allow me to congratulate you both.
- Congratulate us?
- On your engagement.
Why, thank you.
- Would you care to order now?
- Sure.
I didn't get a chance to...
I think we'll have the cod fish.
- Very good.
- I don't like fish.
Oh, of course.
Well, the filet mignon.
How would you like those?
- Medium.
- Rare.
- Rare.
- Of course. Thank you.
So, where do you come from?
Home.
Oh, no, I meant...
San Diego.
Wow, San Diego.
- How did you get here?
- Walked.
No, I meant from San Diego.
Drove.
- Do you like it here?
- It's OK.
I was on my way to Nepal.
Nepal? Wow. What's in Nepal?
Monks.
Oh, right.
What are you doing?
Martin said
I had to do it right away.
Martin said.
You called?
No. Actually, we're fine.
I'm sorry, sir, but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
What?
Excuse me. Can I have a word, please?
Just for a second.
You went too far this time, "Martin".
What do I... What do I owe you?
Fifty.
Cheers.
I don't drink. It makes me sick.
Really?
How much to drink a glass of whisky?
Twenty.
Twenty bucks? Yeah? OK.
Whoa, wait.
I didn't say how big it would be.
Bottoms up.
I guess you hear that phrase quite a bit.
Joyce, you're dribbling.
That wasn't part of the deal.
All right.
I'll give you $100.
$100, if you can tell me that you love me...
- I love you.
... and make me believe it.
- I love you.
- No, come on.
It's too fast. Didn't ring true.
I didn't believe it. Did you?
- I don't...
- OK, I'll add another 50.
That's all my allowance now.
It's all yours if you can make it sound real.
- I love you.
- No. Come on.
- I love you.
- No, make me believe it.
- I...
- Make it sound real.
I love you.
No.
I didn't believe it. Sorry.
How you feeling, Joyce?
OK.
- Why do you take all this shit?
- What's it to you?
- Tell us about your customers.
- Why?
Tell us about your clients, the weird ones. Tell us what they do.
- Why?
- Curiosity.
Answer the fucking question.
One dresses up like a baby and makes me change his...
That's not weird enough.
- One guy makes me pee...
- Weirder.
One guy makes me pretend I'm dead.
Yes!
He covers me in a sheet and puts a tag on my toe and then he...
Then he what?
- Then he...
- Then he what?
Tell us what's wrong, Joyce.
My friend, Leanne, brought the psycho home.
And?
And she...
They...
- I'd rather not.
- Tell us.
No. Please, can I go now?
Please, tell us.
They made me identify her body.
He took her eyes.
Could there be a relation between the guy that makes you pretend...
What the hell do you care?
Can I go now?
You think you've met him?
Can I go now?
How was your evening?
OK, you know. Typical James.
- I don't know how Marie takes it.
- Me neither.
Who's Joyce?
Joyce?
I don't know. Why?
She called late, asking for you.
For me?
Yes.
I don't know.
I don't know who that could be.
Did she say what it was about?
No.
- She leave a number?
- No.
I don't know.
Here's Johnny!
And the question still remains, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, what did the defendant know?
When did he know it?
And if he's so fucking smart...
- Hello.
- Have you been here?
- I can't hear you.
- Have you been here?
Come to think of it,
I'm not even home. Leave a message.
The boy who cried zombie.
Just you wait.
She's down there.
OK, which one was it?
Think you can still remember?
- It was the prostitute.
- Prostitute.
Well, good morning, Miss Singer.
This young man claims that you've been up and about.
Well, isn't that strange?
She appears to be as dead as a fucking doornail.
But I saw her there.
I saw her like I'm seeing you.
Hello? Miss Singer?
Hello! Is this thing on?
Still dead.
Listen. I saw...
- What's going on?
- Sorry, Inspector, but I thought
I might need some backup.
- Did you have a problem?
- Yeah! I saw this...
His problem is he's under-medicated.
I saw her in the hallway.
I've gotten rid of people for much less.
This is like one of those movies on the USA Network.
- What do you mean?
- The hero sees something weird and then no one will believe him.
You know, sometimes, Martin, when you get overly tired, the lines get a little blurry.
No, but I saw it.
- Now that guy thinks I'm crazy.
- No, no, no. Forget the doctor.
I think he has too much access to the medicines he freely prescribes.
You saw what you saw.
Here, Martin.
You can always reach me here.
Oh, OK.
Try and take it easy.
- Don't go back.
- We need the money.
We can borrow from my mother.
We don't want your family's money.
By the time my father was 22, he was married to a woman he didn't love and he was having an affair with the woman he did.
And what does that mean to you?
That he was afraid.
- Of what?
- Of life.
- Yes.
- Will you marry me?
Yes.
Shit, I hate that place.
Are you Katherine, Martin's...
Martin's girlfriend?
I can't... I know I'm supposed to memorise it, but I forget.
Maybe...
Maybe you could write it down for me.
You're not gonna give it to me until I remember. I know.
If you write it down,
I'll remember. I swear.
- Are you Katherine?
- Yes.
- Martin's girlfriend?
- Yes.
Please make him stop it.
Won't you please make him stop?
- Hello?
- Hello.
- How was it?
- We finished early.
What was that?
Let's get one thing straight, you shit. I'm not Marie!
If you wanna treat someone like James treats Marie, find somebody else.
What are you talking about?
- I met your little slave girl today.
- Who?
Joyce.
Yeah, go ahead, tell me she's some little lying junkie whore who makes up stories. Go on!
Look, I... I...
- Do you want me to play dead?
- What?
- You screwed her, didn't you?
- No!
No, it was just a game, I swear!
What did she say?
Do you want me to play dead?
Is that what turns you on?
What?
- Is that how you like it?
- No, Katherine.
Katherine, what...?
- What are...?
- Did you enjoy it?
Shit.
What?
Did you enjoy it?
- Excuse me?
- Did you enjoy it?
- Hello, Martin.
- Hi.
How are you?
I don't know.
Tell me, Martin, you did your rounds last night?
Of course. Why?
Come with me.
What can you tell me about that?
I don't know.
- Paul.
- I see a dead girl turned over on her stomach with her legs spread apart, as though she's been sexually assaulted.
The doctor tells me you're the only one that's been in here.
Cray. You might want to have a look at this.
Martin, what can you tell me about the drops of semen over there?
Someone's trying to frame me.
I'm as confused as you are, but the murder victim's played tricks twice now and you've been involved both times.
- Do you have any enemies?
- Not that I know of.
Debts? Old grudges?
Angry drug dealers? Anything?
Wait a minute. There was someone.
This hooker, Joyce.
I went with her.
I see.
The girl down there was her friend.
She identified the body.
The police must know her.
- Young girl. Redhead, skinny.
- Yeah, right.
I remember interviewing her.
What happened?
First, she called my house one night.
Then she met my girlfriend and said I'd done stuff that I never did.
Why would she do that?
- How did you meet her?
- Through a friend. It was a joke.
Friend? Which friend?
Just some guy, James.
It was supposed to be a joke.
So many things are.
What's your friend's full name?
James Christian Galman.
- Martin.
- Yeah?
If all this is what I think it is... there's someone very dangerous standing right behind you in the dark breathing down your neck.
And maybe you've unwittingly become his link to Joyce.
What do you mean, "his link"?
I think the murderer wants the murder to be exposed.
- I still don't get it.
- Well, I think he wants to stop.
I think he's tired of killing.
Wants to be free.
But he won't be free as long as we're looking for him.
And how long will we continue looking for him?
Till we catch the killer.
So what's the solution to his dilemma?
Get somebody else caught in his place.
He chooses a new victim... and then he makes someone else look guilty when he kills her.
He's already gained Joyce's trust.
Now all he needs to do is find her killer.
Her killer?
No, this is too absurd.
Why does Joyce suddenly call you?
Why does she go see your girlfriend?
Think about what's happened here.
Think about that doctor that looks at you without doubt in his mind.
Even Deputy Inspector Bill suspects you.
No, you can't be serious.
Don't worry, Martin.
I know it's not you.
It has to be someone that knows his way around here.
So, what about the old night watchman?
Yes, I'll look into it.
- What about the semen in the morgue?
- What about it?
Yes, well, the lab is gonna analyse it, but in the meantime, can we have a sample from you?
Martin, it's Joyce.
I need to see you. It's important.
There are some things I need to tell you that I couldn't tell you before.
I need to see you in person, tonight at eight.
Excuse me?
My address is 9248 Second Street, number 322.
Fuck this!
He wasn't at home.
It was the answering machine.
Hey, buddy. How you doing?
What's the matter with you?
What are you doing with Joyce?
- What?
- The police can't find the murderer.
Someone raped one of the victims.
- Someone threatened Joyce.
- Shit.
- So, they know who it is?
- They have a suspect.
- Who is it?
- The wrong guy, I guess.
I guess they got the wrong guy.
You wanna narrow that down a little bit? Which wrong guy?
- It's me.
- You?
They think it's you?
Oh, boy!
Boy, they got the wrong guy.
I'll ask you this once and then I'll walk away and forget all about it.
OK.
Is it you?
Martin!
Oh, come on. Martin!
It makes me sick when I think of the scum out there.
God gave him over... in the sinful desires of their hearts, to sexual impurity...
Do you know...
Do you know where the Himalayas are?
I have always wanted to go to the Himalayas.
I've always wanted to go there.
I've always wanted to go to the Himalayas.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Martin, it's Joyce.
I need to see you.
It's important.
There are some things I need to tell you that I couldn't tell you before.
I need to see you in person, tonight at eight.
My address is 9248 Second Street, number 322.
Damn, what if you wouldn't have gotten out of there?
Can you imagine what he would...
Katherine, we have to call the police.
We can't let her just lie there.
They found her.
A young girl was found dead tonight, the third in as many weeks.
We have all the evidence we need.
We'll have closure soon.
I'd like to talk to the duty doctor.
One moment.
- Hello?
- Yeah, hello. This is Martin Bells.
You know, the screwed-up kid from Forensics.
- Joyce asked me to say hello.
- Who?
Joyce. Your playmate.
Listen. I have personally asked for your removal. Go home.
Well, I thought you'd want me to stay.
Go and see a psychiatrist.
Do you think I'm a psychopath?
You wouldn't be the first night watchman who was.
The first.
The first.
Deputy Inspector Bill Davies,
I'd like to speak to Martin Bells.
- He's not here.
- We don't know where he is.
- Hello.
- Yeah, hi. It's me.
Joyce has been murdered. The cops are here looking for you right now.
- I'm going over.
- It's too dangerous.
He didn't do it!
Keep your ears open.
I'm gonna try something.
- Martin is not a murderer.
- We don't make up evidence.
He's a suspect because weird things happened at work?
Listen. She exposed him herself.
- She wrote his name.
- What did she write?
- His name.
- Yeah, but what name?
Martin.
We changed the names.
Joyce thought he was James so she would have written James.
- That makes you our prime suspect.
- This is ridiculous.
- There was no name.
- What?
Katherine was there.
You were there? When?
There was a lot of blood.
But there was no name.
And the murderer... was still there.
- What?
- Katherine.
Hello.
Yeah, hello? This is Martin Bells.
The new... new night watchman.
You showed me around here.
You know what time it is?
Inspector Cray, please. Well, where'd he go? The hospital? Alone?
You told me the story about the guy who did it with... you know.
- When was it?
- The guy with the corpses?
- Yeah.
- Before I started, late '60s.
- Do you remember his name?
- No.
- And what happened to him?
- Nothing.
- What?
- The embarrassment.
The hospital couldn't press charges.
No. I guess he's out there somewhere.
Where is she?
Cray.
Hello?
Martin, it's Inspector Cray.
We have a situation here.
Joyce has been murdered.
We have to talk.
Well, I'll come down to the station.
We really have to get to the bottom of this.
I think it might be better if I pick you up.
Martin?
- Are you still there?
- I'd prefer to come to the station.
I'll come and get you.
Tell me, Martin. Are you still gonna maintain your innocence?
Yeah.
Who else could it be, Martin?
The killing has to stop, Martin.
Don't you want it to stop?
Maybe I could talk to Deputy Inspector Bill.
Why wouldn't you want to talk to me?
You're under arrest, Martin.
Would you please put this on your desk?
We have all the time in the world to wait for your confession, Martin.
All the time in the world.
I want you to do me a favour, Martin.
- Hit me.
- What?
Come on, hit me.
How much more can you take?
Do you know what they'll do to you?
They'll snuff you out like a bug hitting a windshield.
You're going to die anyway, Martin.
Don't you know that you're going to die?
Come on, Martin.
You've got to do something.
Protect yourself. Save yourself.
This is your last chance!
Do something... or I'll take your girlfriend's eyes.
Martin?
He's gone mad! Get in the hall!
Get in the hall!
No!
Katherine!
I shouldn't be telling you this, but she wrote his name before she died.
I know.
Deputy Inspector Bill told me.
Deputy Inspector Bill told you?
That's highly unorthodox.
I'm very glad you told me this.
This changes everything.
All right, let's go through this one more time.
Why didn't you call from Joyce's apartment?
Because the murderer was still there.
The murderer was still there?
She was already dead.
- She was already dead?
- She hadn't written anything, so...
- Yes?
- Someone else must have written it.
Trying to frame Martin, right?
Trying to frame Martin? Yes.
Where are we?
Interesting theory.
What do we do now?
Martin, I'm waiting.
Hey, I was worried about you.
- He hit me and escaped.
- Something's wrong.
Nothing's wrong. Who's this?
James.
- Where's Katherine?
- How should I know?
Her bike's outside, she must be in here somewhere.
She's not in here. He, uh...
He probably took her with him.
Martin!
Help!
Help us!
Take him to the station. I'll take a look at Joyce. I'll meet you there.
- Wait, why would they try to escape?
- Take it easy.
Handcuff him.
What?
You're under arrest for suspicion of murder.
This is bullshit.
You have doubts too. Tell him!
Doubts?
Doubts about what,
Deputy Inspector Bill?
Nothing.
I don't like it when you keep things from me, Deputy Inspector Bill.
I've always encouraged you to have your own ideas, haven't I?
- Yeah. It's nothing. He's babbling.
- You said something was wrong.
Well, something is definitely wrong.
Take him away.
Have you ever been killed before?
I'll be back in a minute.
No. No. No.
This just doesn't happen.
It's not happening.
Cray, why are you doing this?
What the hell are you doing?
Stop asking for the how and why,
Martin.
Does it hurt?
Let's grow old together.
Yeah.
Let's get older.
There's a challenge.
James, we're gonna take a little ride now, all right? Keep that up.
Can you walk?
Hello, admitting.
This is Saperstein.
Where is he?
He's cleared admitting?
Right. Bring him in.
He's coming.
Good, good.
Trent?
John J.
Put him in number nine.
You son of a bitch!
Hang on to him.
Get him in there!
No, not me!
No, wait, wait!
This is wrong.
Look, I'm sorry about the balls!
It was a lucky shot, that's all!
Wait!
I'm not insane.
You hear me?
I'm not insane!
I'm not if he's not!
Me neither!
I'm not insane!
We've only just begun
Not the Carpenters, too.
So let me go
This is a rotten way to end it.
This is not the ending.
You haven't read it yet.
All right.
Came in this afternoon?
Yes. How did you get here so fast?
We've been monitoring all admissions... through police and paramedic channels.
This one fit the symptoms.
Do you think he's one of them?
Mr. Saperstein, I promise you... that's what I'm here to find out.
Things must be getting pretty bad out there... to bring you fellas in.
Is this it?
Did he make any requests?
Just... one.
A, uh... single black crayon.
Hang on.
What's up?
My name is Dr. Wrenn... and I am going to try and get you out of here.
After all my redecorating?
No. I think I'll stay.
There's a guard with a pair of swollen testicles... who swears you wanted out of here.
I, uh, well...
I've changed my mind.
I see.
The crosses are a nice touch.
They'd almost have to keep you in here... once they'd seen these, wouldn't they, John?
Got a smoke?
You're waiting to hear about my "them," aren't you?
Your what?
My "them. "
Every paranoid schizophrenic has one...
a "them," a "they," an "it. "
And you want to hear about my "them," don't you?
I want to know how you got here.
Things are turning to shit out there, aren't they?
Let's talk about you.
Your dime.
I'm, uh...
I was an insurance investigator, freelance.
Checked out funny claims, frauds... the usual kind of thing.
And lately I'd been working for a firm here in the city.
And all of this started with the disappearance.
The Sutter Cane... disappearance.
It's a little hot in here, isn't it?
It's boiling.
How long I gotta be here?
I mean, uh...
I took care of all that paperwork.
The check was supposed to be here three weeks ago.
Right? Isn't that right?
Well, usually, yeah, that's the way it goes... but I just have a few final questions about the fire.
More questions.
I've answered all your questions.
Enough's enough.
It was supposed to be cut and dried.
We'll be out of here in a minute.
See, Robby here, he owns the company.
And he's hired me to see that things go smoothly, understand?
It's just a little thing, but, see...
Robby takes the view that it was you... who burned down your own warehouse on Northern Boulevard.
Me? That's horseshit.
That was all my own stuff in that warehouse.
That's my whole life.
Believe me, I sympathize.
You're really starting to sweat.
Shall I turn on the air conditioning?
Oh, no, I'm fine.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
I'm running a little late.
Supposed to pick up my wife.
Oh, yeah, your wife.
She's a great lady.
You know her?
No, not really.
We just met briefly.
You know, when I went round to check up on your story.
We have these photographs... of your wife tooling around town... wearing various articles... that you claim were destroyed in the fire.
No, that's impossible.
No, this is all stuff
I bought for her myself.
See, the problem is... when I went round to talk to her... it turned out she knew much more than she thought she did.
Especially...
Especially after I showed her pictures of Miss Palminteri... who appears to be wearing... even more of your destroyed articles.
Miss Palminteri?
Miss Rosa Palminteri.
A word of advice.
You want to pull a scam, don't make your wife a partner.
If you do... don't fuck around behind her back.
Trent, beautiful.
Everybody says you got the best nose for a con in the business.
But to see it firsthand, I mean, to watch you work... is incredible.
Well, it wasn't hard, Robby.
The guy's wife liked me.
Besides, he was an amateur.
It's too easy with amateurs.
You try to figure out who's professional and who isn't.
That's when it gets fun, when you run into a pro.
You know, most of my salesmen... couldn't sniff out a phony claim... if their noses were nailed to it, but you... man, you never miss.
What's to miss?
You learn to expect the worst in people, and you get it.
Everyone's looking to play an angle.
I'm always there to clean up the mess.
I'll tell you what.
You stop freelancing, join my staff.
I'll make it worth your while.
Forget it, Robby.
I'm my own man.
Nobody pulls my strings.
I'm independent, I'm happy.
Well, be my man one more time.
I'm having quite a difficult mess with Arcane.
The publishing house?
Yeah, my biggest account.
They just filed a claim that cost me millions.
I want you on this right away.
What's the claim?
Sutter Cane is missing.
Who?
Sutter Cane.
Do you read Sutter Cane?
What?
Horror writer Sutter Cane... a harmless pop phenomenon... or a deadly mad prophet of the printed page?
This was the scene today outside several city bookstores.
Police believe the riots began... because the stores could not meet the demand... for advance orders of Sutter Cane's latest novel...
"In the Mouth of Madness. "
When does fiction become religion?
And are his fans dangerous?
Only if you count axes.
In related news, there were eighteen other stores...
Mr. Harglow will see you now.
Thank you.
You're not listening to me.
I needed it yesterday.
If you wait any longer, it'll be all over the front page.
Get it done!
Jackson Harglow, Mr. Trent.
I'm pleased to meet you.
It's a pleasure.
Excuse the commotion.
We have something of a crisis going on.
Everybody out now, please.
I need time with Mr. Trent.
Have Sylvia hold the calls, and you get Linda in here.
That was great.
I almost left myself.
Sit down, please.
I am a little short on patience these days.
So, Mr. Trent, are you familiar with Arcane?
Well, aside from the fact... that you're insured by the company I work for...
I never heard of Arcane.
I'm sorry.
You read books?
Linda Styles, John Trent.
Linda reads books for a living.
She's one of our best editors.
Since she joined the firm... she's been handling
Sutter Cane exclusively.
Isn't he the guy that writes that horror crap?
Maybe he's too sophisticated for you.
Sutter Cane happens to be... this century's most widely read author.
You can forget about Stephen King.
Cane outsells them all.
So what happened to this cash cow of yours?
Cane disappeared two months ago without a trace.
The police have turned up nothing.
Who was the last person to hear from him?
His agent.
Cane mailed him several chapters... of his new book, oh, not two weeks ago.
Plain brown wrapper.
No return address.
Oh, gee, I'm sorry.
You don't mind, do you?
What'd the agent have to say?
You heard what he had to say.
What are you talking about?
I understand you were there... when the poor man went crazy in midtown Manhattan.
You witnessed the shooting,
I believe.
That lunatic with the ax?
That was Cane's agent?
Hard to believe, isn't it?
Yeah, well, you'd think a guy that outsells Stephen King... could find better representation.
Excuse me.
It's just a little joke.
Well, we're not in the mood.
I'll see you out, Mr. Trent.
Thank you.
Cane is a billion-dollar franchise.
He's the tent pole to this company.
We've already sold the film rights to his new book... as well as publication rights in eighteen languages...
The book you can't find?
Well, his agent found it, at least part of it.
You think he took one look at this latest work of art... and went ax-happy in broad daylight?
I think it's great.
It's great promotion for Arcane, great publicity.
This was not a publicity stunt.
You were there.
Cane's writing has been known to have an effect... on his less stable readers.
An effect? Like what?
Well, disorientation, memory loss... severe paranoid reaction.
People pay money to feel like that? It's cute.
Put it in the press kit.
We need you.
OK. Well, why don't you and I get together after work?
We'll go through his files.
I don't think so.
I need to see his contracts, papers, you know.
Impossible.
His agent was a total buffer.
We don't even know where Cane lives.
What do you know?
For about a year before he disappeared... his work became erratic, bent, more bizarre than usual.
He became convinced his writing was real, not fiction.
Then the work stopped coming.
I need to know if he's alive or dead.
And I need that book.
We've delayed publication as long as we can.
His fans are getting really restless.
This shit really sells, doesn't it?
More than you'd imagine.
Surprised?
Lady, nothing surprises me.
We fucked up the air, the water, we fucked up each other.
Why don't we finish the job... by just flushing our brains down the toilet?
Why don't you try reading his stuff?
See if you can get it.
Got any on tape?
You want some, too, buddy?
No, relax, Robby.
Look, it's a scam, of course it's a scam.
You see... all this strange behaviorfrom people that read the books... and the agent going nuts and so on...
Ifigure it's like mass hysteria, you know?
It's like, um, it's a pop phenomenon.
It's a craze. It'll pass.
It's this year's Hula-Hoop.
Something like that.
Yeah, my God, it's freaky.
No, it's a setup.
I just have to work out how it's set up.
It's just a matter of time.
You, too?
God, I've had heartburn, tell me about it.
Sporadic riots continue to hit Eastern cities... and reports of violence from Boston and Philadelphia... are now coming in.
Police continue to describe barely coherent witnesses... all reporting having read... horror novelist
Sutter Cane's latest novel...
'Hobb's End Horror. "
Many officers have been physically attacked... and more than three hundred eighty people... male and female, have been jailed in New York County.
Two officers in Boston were hacked to death... amid jeering crowds in an attack last night.
What is this horrible, unexplainable madness... that is gripping our lives?
What in the world is happening?
I can see.
Now we have an editorial...
Excuse me?
He sees you.
Great. Uh...
Tell him I say hi.
Oh, hi, Robby. Yeah.
Yeah, not a lot.
I picked up some of these Sutter Cane books.
I've been reading them.
Well, it...
Pulp horror novels.
They're all pretty familiar.
They all seem to have the same plot.
Slimy things in the dark, people go mad... they turn into monsters.
The funny thing is that they're kind of better written... than you'd expect.
They sort of get to you in a way.
I don't know if it's his style of writing... or his use of description or whatever, but...
No, don't be silly.
Do you want some, too, buddy?
He sees you.
What?
Aw, it's just too weird.
Beautiful.
Where'd you go?
Assuming you went somewhere.
Cute.
Now I know why Cane had the artwork done himself.
See this?
It's a map.
The red dot is Hobb's End.
It's not on any real map, but look at this.
The two line up.
Like it or not...
Cane's book covers place Hobb's End... right in the middle of New England.
So you're saying the man went someplace fictional?
It's a real place in a real state.
New Hampshire, to be precise.
But it's not on the map.
Well, not on any new ones, but maybe on some old ones.
There's plenty of forgotten towns across America.
Makes a great contest, doesn't it?
Put the pieces together, find the town... win a Sutter Cane lunchbox.
How can you be sure he's there?
Well, I'd have to go to be sure.
You sure you want me to go?
I'm not suggesting that you're lying... that you're about to file a fraudulent claim... but forgive me if this sounds... a little bit like bullshit to me.
And if you're telling the truth... if you really want your author back... if you really want your book... then maybe it's in both our best interests... if I go find him.
We have nothing to hide,
Mr. Trent.
I desire only ourfair share if Cane is dead... or our property if he's alive.
Since I assume you also have nothing to hide...
I'm sure you won't mind if I send Miss Styles along... on your expedition.
Well, it's your party.
America, the
Beautiful
From sea to
Shining
Who is it? What?
You're awake.
Couldn't you just shake me, you asshole?
What did I do?
We're lost.
We are lost because there is no such place as Hobb's End.
Well, we'll see.
Never, never, never... throw chips at a driver.
God damn it. Shit.
Asshole.
Styles, can I ask you something?
Do you really like working on Cane's stuff?
Do you really like busting people?
Yeah. I bust frauds,
I bust phonies... and, yeah, I love it.
Have you ever busted anyone you know?
Yeah, sure I did.
Didn't make any difference.
You see, in my business, you soon find out... that anybody's capable of anything.
If you can think of it, they've done it.
Doesn't leave you much to believe in.
Yeah.
But think of the upside... it doesn't leave you much to be disappointed in, either.
Believe me, the sooner we're off the planet, the better.
Now you sound like Cane.
No, not me.
You're the Cane lover.
I just like being scared.
Cane's work scares me.
What's to be scared about?
It's not like it's real or anything.
It's not real from your point of view... and right now reality shares your point of view.
What scares me about Cane's work... is what might happen if reality shared his point of view.
Whoa. We're not talking about reality here.
We're talking about fiction.
It's different, you know.
A reality is just what we tell each other it is.
Sane and insane could easily switch places... if the insane were to become the majority.
You would find yourself locked in a padded cell... wondering what happened to the world.
No, that wouldn't happen to me.
It would if you realized... everything you ever knew was gone.
It'd be pretty lonely being the last one left.
Not only in Manhattan proper... but there was that incident in Long Island... that was also related to it.
Come on, I don't buy this.
I mean, what are you saying?
That there's some kind of disease... that's spreading across the country?
It is an addiction that people have at this time... fantasy-creating out of the written material.
How could it be addicting?
Look, I mean this is words.
Or just something that is created by the press?
No. I think it's acting stupid is what it is.
Jesus Christ.
I saw a...
A cow, a sheep, a pig?
What'd you see?
Never mind.
It was nothing.
Good.
Don't move him!
Is he alive?
I don't know.
Just don't move.
He'll get a blanket, so lie still.
I can't get out.
Don't move.
They won't let me out.
He was OK?
Come on, let's go.
We'll tell the cops when we hit the next town.
You OK?
Oh, I can't believe it.
I must have slept through the whole night.
Hey, thanks for driving.
What is it?
Look.
Styles, you're fantastic.
You found it.
What's wrong?
You drive.
Cute, cute, cute.
Main Street, USA.
Jesus.
Antiques.
Look at this old crap.
I wonder where they manufacture this shit.
Look.
Those kids.
You didn't see them?
Where is everyone?
It's like the place is picture perfect... and there's nobody around.
Come on.
Styles, how'd you know about this place?
I thought you'd never been here before.
I haven't.
I've read about it.
So have you.
This is empty now.
It used to be filled with strange growing things... remember?
One night, the townspeople saw something moving in here... something enormous, with arms like snakes.
'Hobb's End Horror. "
The hotelfrom...
'Hobb's End Horror. "
Styles, you know what I'm thinking?
There's gotta be a great tie-in for a town like this.
I mean, think of the tourist potential, for instance, or...
There should be a painting behind us.
It's nice.
There's a loose board there.
Good morning.
Can I help you folks?
I certainly hope so.
We'd like a room, please.
We're on our way to Boston.
We thought we'd take a... break in yourfamous little town.
Famous?
Yeah, what with the whole
Sutter Cane thing and all.
Sut-Sutter who?
Cane. We heard he came from around here... and comes back to stay once in a while.
Uh, I don't know anybody named Cane.
Ha. Nobody passes through here much anymore.
Let me get you your keys.
You want me to leave a deposit or my credit card or something?
Oh, city folk.
Miss Styles, if that's what you saw, then... yeah, I guess it would be a little... unsettling.
I'd be a little unnerved myself.
But regardless of what you saw, regardless of what you think... we are not living inside a Sutter Cane story.
They're all in here.
The Mrs. Pickman in the book is a lunatic... who chops her husband into coleslaw.
That sweet old thing that we met downstairs... isn't capable of anything worse than... dipping her dentures into her husband's beer.
Trent, I know you think this is a joke.
Just listen to me for a second, please.
What if Cane's work isn't fiction?
Oh, for Christ's sake.
This is reality.
You hear that?
Reality.
Now, if what you're saying is true... there should be out that window... a black Byzantine church with two-hundred-fifty-foot spires... with gold onions on the top.
Now, look.
You see?
Reality.
You didn't read closely enough.
The view is from the east.
"This place had once been the seat of an evil...
"older than mankind...
"and wider than the known universe.
"It was a place of pain and suffering...
"beyond human understanding. "
You got me reading this thing like it's a guidebook.
"Originally, there was an old stone church...
"built on this site in seventeen eighty-eight...
"but the black church...
"swallowed up the old sanctuary...
"the way it has swallowed our minds.
"Now there is nothing left of what was once here...
"except the mosaic of our Lord and Savior...
"above the front door. "
"Some believe the old sanctuary still exists somewhere...
"trapped inside this evil edifice.
"It's primeval inhabitants...
"were a murderous race of creatures...
"whose vile existence contaminated time itself...
"affecting history...
"with their sadistic wickedness. "
It's the battle for heaven.
The archangel Michael's fighting off...
Don't tell me. "Fighting off one of the creatures...
"from the other side," right?
A representation. The things
Cane writes are indescribable.
"Beyond description. "
Right.
We're wasting our time.
We ought to be asking about Cane.
We'll have somebody to ask in about two seconds.
Come on, we have to get out of here.
We can't be in front of the church, Trent.
They have guns, Trent.
No, I want to go back.
Give him back!
Johnny!
Johnny-boy!
Is that Cane?
Get in the truck!
Where are they comingfrom?
I see.
Tell me how you knew about that mob!
You see, you can't bullshit a bullshitter, can you?
'Cause I'll tell you how.
This whole thing has been staged, that's how.
You, Harglow, and Cane put me through all of this... so I can blab to the media... about Cane's haunted little town... help you sell a few more million copies.
Well, fuck that.
- You're wrong.
- No, I'm not.
Before I leave this shitty town...
I'm going to find someone who's going to come clean... and we're going to dismiss your bullshit claim.
You're wrong, Trent.
I know you are wrong.
How am I wrong?
Because you're right.
You're half right.
This was a hoax.
We did send Cane away on a publicity stunt... only he never showed up.
Harglow sent me with you to make it look good... only we weren't supposed to find anything, but we did.
That's how I know what we're seeing is real.
We didn't stage any of this.
It's all happening for real, Trent.
And it is all in that book, and that's how I know.
You're lying.
I read the books, too, you remember?
There's nothing about any mob, any little girl.
Not in the old books, Trent.
In the new one!
No one knew what was in it except me and Cane's agent.
All right.
What's it about, the new one?
It's about the end to everything... and it starts here in this place... with an evil that returns and takes over Hobb's End... piece by piece, starting with the children.
It's about people turning into things... creatures that aren't human anymore.
It's fiction, Styles, fiction.
We need to read the new book to find the way out.
How's that gonna help?
We could skip to the ending.
I really hope you're making this up... because if you're not, you're actually crazy.
Please, Trent.
Don't make me do this alone,
Trent.
Are you coming with me?
Fine.
Have a nice bus ride home.
No smoking, please.
It bothers my husband.
I'm sorry.
I just can't seem to help myself around here.
I was just on my way out.
I thought I'd stop and admire the artwork.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Sure is.
Styles told me you painted it yourself.
You mean the pretty young thing you came in here with?
I don't know her at all.
Does she know me?
She claims she does.
So you're not responsible for this?
Hell, no.
Well, it's a nice place you got here.
It must be a hell of a thing to keep clean.
You look as if you've been up all night.
Been reading.
Hush!
You're a writer?
You an actor?
Take a hint, leave.
This ain't no tourist town.
Oh, I've been trying to.
You guys are good, you know.
You, the old lady at the hotel...
Really, really good.
Cane's been messing with the church.
Now something came leaking out, took the little ones first... then passed it on to us.
Can I buy you a beer?
Don't let it get to you.
Just get out.
Give it.
What are you?
Where do you come from?
Where do you live?
With you.
Who takes care of you?
You do.
You're my mommy.
Know what today is?
Today is Mommy's Day.
Nice to see you again.
You can edit this one from the inside, looking out.
It's funny, isn't it?
For years, I thought
I was making all this up.
But they were telling me what to write... giving me the power to make it all real.
And now it is.
All those horrible, slimy things... trying to get back in?
They're all true.
Come.
See the instrument of their homecoming.
What you have come lookingfor.
The new Bible... that starts the change... helps you see.
Do you like my ending?
Any suggestions?
You found something.
Where the hell did you go?
I'm losing me, John.
Help me.
I'm losing me.
What's happening?
I saw the book.
Don't look at it.
Don't read it, John.
I'm losing me!
Mrs. Pickman!
Come on, you old bitch.
We're going. Now.
You are a dead girl
Fuck you!
You're still here.
Busy night.
Special effects, hidden speakers.
You people are professionals,
I'll give you that.
The thing I can't remember is what came first... us or the book.
We are not living in a Sutter Cane story!
This is not reality!
Reality is not what it used to be.
Oh, Jesus, this place makes my head hurt.
Oh, really?
Come on, look at this.
This was done by a five-year-old... my five-year-old.
Johnny's sister.
She did me after she did her mom.
You're alone.
Shit. Don't.
I have to.
He wrote me this way.
Oh, shit.
The key.
Jesus!
Christ.
Shit.
Never leave the city.
Why don't I learn?
Are we leaving?
We're already home.
You should have believed me.
Where's the fucking highway?
Cane's writing me.
He wants me to kiss you.
Why?
Because it's good for the book.
Jesus!
It's what the readers want to read.
Oh, God!
Go! Get... get away from me!
Cane has a job for you.
Afew bad calls.
Afew wrong turns.
Do you want to know the problem with places like this?
With religion in general?
It's never known how to convey the anatomy of horror.
Religion seeks discipline through fear... yet doesn't understand the true nature of creation.
No one's ever believed it enough to make it real.
The same cannot be said of my world.
Your books aren't real.
But they've sold over a billion copies.
I've been translated into eighteen languages.
More people believe in my work than believe in the Bible.
You got a point?
I think you know it.
There has to be some kind of an explanation... for what I've seen tonight.
I'll sort this shit out later, but right now... there has to be some kind of a simple fucking explanation.
Always lookingfor the con.
Even now you're trying to rationalize.
Anyway... your books suck.
You must try reading my new one.
The others have had quite an effect... but this one will drive you absolutely mad.
So I'm told.
It'll make the world ready for the change.
It takes its power... from new readers and new believers.
That's the point.
Belief!
When people begin to lose their ability... to know the difference between fantasy and reality... the old ones can begin their journey back.
The more people who believe, the faster the journey.
And with the way the other books have sold... this one is bound to be very, very popular.
Want to see?
All done.
"In the Mouth of Madness. "
Yours to deliver, Trent.
What?
I will be joining my new publishers now.
You take the manuscript back to the world for me... that's what you do.
What I do?
You are what I write.
Like this town.
It wasn't here before I wrote it.
And neither were you.
I know what's real.
I know what I am... and nobody pulls my strings.
Did you think my agent attacked you by accident?
He read about you... in there.
He knew you'd bring it back and start the change... make what's happened here happen everywhere.
He tried to stop you.
I'm not a piece of fiction.
I think, therefore you are.
Read it if you don't believe me.
See what I have in store for you.
I know what I am.
Go back.
Your world lies beyond that passage.
Go now.
I can't hold them back any longer.
"Trent stood at the edge of the rip...
"stared into the illimitable gulf of the unknown...
"the Stygian world yawning blackly beyond.
"Trent's eyes refused to close.
"He did not shriek...
"but the hideous unholy abominations...
"shrieked for him...
"as in the same second he saw them...
"spill and tumble upward...
"out of an enormous carrion black pit...
"choked with the gleaming white bones...
"of countless unhallowed centuries.
"He began to back away from the rip...
"as the army of unspeakable figures...
"twilit by the glow from the bottomless pit...
"came pouring at him toward our world. "
Come with me.
I can't.
I've read to the end.
Hey, kid.
You want a paper?
Have you been in an accident?
You want me to get somebody?
No. Just...
Just point me to the highway.
Straight up.
Hey, kid.
Did you ever hear of Hobb's End?
What?
Package for you, sir.
But nobody knows I'm here.
Well, someone does.
Who delivered this?
I don't know.
Who?!
I don't know!
I wasn't here last night.
Who was it?!
I was.
And I didn't see shit.
I remember New York during the Depression.
They think they have it bad now.
You should have seen the Bowery back then.
Bodies piled two, three feet high off the gutter.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm God now.
You understand?
God's not supposed to be a hack horror writer.
But maybe
I can help you believe.
Look around when you wake up.
Did I ever tell you my favorite color was blue?
Relax, buddy.
Relax.
You're awake now.
It was just a bad dream.
Are you deaf and dumb, sir?
I was just there in the town... in that town, and... there were people there... and shops and homes and...
I don't doubt that.
What I'm telling you for the tenth time... is that it couldn't have been called Hobb's End.
There never was, is, or shall be any such place... by that name in this state.
Ever.
I want to see your supervisor!
Well... that is quite a story.
If you could write it,
I'd publish it.
You don't believe it, do you?
If I don't, what's my option?
That I'm crazy?
I'm not crazy.
Have you heard the rumors... that Cane's books have affected certain readers?
Yeah. Styles told me.
Styles... Oh, that's the girl you say I sent with you.
But I know I sent you off alone.
Why wouldn't I remember her?
Well...
That's easy.
She was written out.
Written out?
Look, do you think... those books somehow infected you?
Listen to me, Harglow.
Everything I've said is true.
It's real.
And that's why I had to destroy the last manuscript.
But I know that's not true.
What are you talking about?
You delivered that manuscript to me months ago.
To me personally in this room.
I did?
Yes, you did.
Last spring.
For God's sakes, we published in July.
The book's been in the stores for seven weeks.
Have you read it?
No.
I never read Cane's work.
I haven't got the stomach for it.
Pull it.
Don't distribute it.
Even if everything I've said is totally Looney Tunes...
I know this book will drive people crazy.
Well, let's hope so.
The movie comes out next month.
Oh, Christ.
The newest, and presumably posthumous, work... of Sutter Cane continues to sit at number one... on the best-seller list.
'In the Mouth of Madness" is expected to break... all previous publishing records.
On the local scene, police are at a loss to explain... the outbreak of violent crime among the city's clergy.
The mayor has called an emergency meeting... of law enforcement and medical agencies... to discuss an apparent epidemic of paranoid schizophrenia.
Just an unbelievably horrible story, Bob.
What began locally... has now broken out into a global epidemic.
An epidemic of monumental proportions... of senseless, seemingly unmotivated acts of violence.
Like the book?
I love it.
Good.
Then this shouldn't come as a surprise.
Jeez!
I don't believe he did that!
It's spreading out there, isn't it?
Just because you know the symptoms... doesn't mean to say your story's true.
It's Cane's story... and it'll spread with each new reader.
That's how it gets its power.
What about the people who don't read?
There's a movie.
Oh, yes, of course.
I'm gonna leave now... but I'll be coming back,
I promise.
I want to help you.
There's no hurry.
It's safer in here now.
It'll get worse out there.
Why?
Every species can smell its own extinction.
The last ones left... won't have a pretty time of it.
And in ten years, maybe less... the human race will just be a bedtime story... for their children.
A myth. Nothing more.
Did he have anything to say?
No. It was useless.
He thinks he's fiction... and that Sutter Cane's causing the epidemic.
Do you read Sutter Cane?
Oh, God!
I'll try and continue... this emergency broadcast as long as we can hold out here.
Um, the city is almost completely deserted now.
There are only a few stragglers left on the streets.
There are no emergency services.
The fires continue to burn out of control.
This incredible epidemic of random mass killing... has spread to every country in the civilized world.
Every hour, more people are becoming infected... being driven to senseless acts of extreme violence.
We have gotten reports, sketchy at best... of people mutating, their bodies swelling and distorting... changing somehow.
Locally, the mass killings appear to have moved inland.
All the major cities on the East Coast are silent.
We lost contact with Los Angeles... and the West Coast last night... so it's impossible at this time to know... how many unaffected people are left.
If for any reason... you are one of us who hasn't become infected... take shelter immediately.
Do not trust any friends or family members.
I repeat... Do not...
I'm sorry about the balls!
It was a lucky shot, that's all!
What?!
I am not insane.
Do you hear me?
I am not insane!
Relax, buddy.
You're awake now.
This is not a Sutter Cane story!
This is not reality!
Not reality! Not reality!
This is reality.
Finga, finga, finga.
Finga.
Finga,
Finga.
Giorgio.
Do you have to drive so fast, Signor Giannetti?
This is not fast, Signora.
Is it far?
No.
Ecco! Castelo D'Orsino.
What does it look like?
It's up on a hill, Beck, just like in a fairy tale.
No, no.
Hold on, sweetie.
You'll catch cold.
You know, when I got your letter, Mr. Giannetti,
I thought it was a scam.
A scam?
Well, it's just hard to believe
I've actually inherited a castle.
This way, Signora.
Signorina.
What's the matter, mom?
Nothing.
Just be careful where you walk around here, okay?
This part was built 700 years ago.
Welcome to Castle Reilly, ladies.
Oh, it is cold, mama.
Have the rooms been prepared, Signor?
Of course, follow me.
I still don't understand how John is related to the Duchess.
I hired an investigation agency, and we found you, Signor Reilly.
You are the son of the late Duchess' sister, the last D'Orsino.
Daddy, I think he's saying that you're the Duke.
Yes, your father is the legal heir of the title and the castle, and the possessions it contains.
I'm afraid the family lost their fortune during the war.
So there is no money.
Mr. Giannetti?
Yes?
How soon can you liquidate the assets of the estate?
Oh, you want to sell?
Yes, everything, as soon as possible.
How much is the estate worth?
Oh, that is impossible to say.
No one but the duchess has been in the castle for 40 years.
This is my sister, Agnese.
She will cook and clean the rooms for you.
Hello, I'm John Reilly.
- This is my wife, Susan...
- Hi.
...and our daughter Rebecca.
Your room is here.
The girl is next door.
Grazie, Signora.
Your mother and you...
...are the Signora and
Signorina of the Castelo.
I'm the housekeeper.
There is much to do if you want to sell the castle.
So, we'll need a list of all the possessions.
An inventory?
Si, si, an inventory.
I must talk to an agent.
Thank you.
Sorry, I have to go.
Arrive derci.
- Bye bye.
- Ciao.
Thanks.
Well, are you staying in the castle, Agnese?
Si, I've a room by the kitchen.
Could you prepare another room for tonight?
Somebody's coming?
Well, it's for my husband.
Si, I'll make another room.
Supper is pasta and vitello?
Vitello?
Si.
Oh, well,
I'm sure that will be lovely.
Thank you very much.
You stay only a little in the castelo?
You sell, and then you go.
Soon.
As soon as we finish our business.
That good.
You sell and then you go.
Soon.
Who is it?
It's me.
Hi.
Hi.
What do you want?
Well, I thought since it's the first night in a new place, that we could make a fresh start of it.
I was just about to go to bed, John.
I took my pill.
Well, I could wake you up, Sleeping Beauty.
You are in my...
- ...castle, you know.
- Don't want it.
You are so beautiful.
John, please, I can't.
I miss you, Susan.
I miss you so, so much.
Stop it!
For Christ's sake.
- It's been nine months.
- I know, I know!
I haven't touched a drop.
I know, you've been very good...
...and I know that
I should try to forgive you, that I should want to forgive you, but I can't.
Then why are you here?
Why did you even come with--
She's in the next room.
I'm sorry.
I'm going to bed now.
Maybe we should pull over until it lets up.
I told your mother that
I would pick you up...
...and I would have you home for dinner.
We're already late.
How ya doin' back there, JJ?
Fine.
Hey! Hey, get back in your seat.
I can get it.
I said get back in your seat, JJ!
Daddy!
Becky?
JJ?
JJ!
JJ!
JJ!
No!
No!
JJ?
JJ?
Ah, God.
Do you need help?
No, thank you,
I just cut myself.
In the middle of the night?
Well, I was looking for the bathroom and I fell.
Did something wake you?
Why, did something wake you?
Old people sleep only a little.
You heard it too, didn't you?
Heard what?
Moaning.
Like a child crying?
My brother, he did not tell you...
...the story?
No, thank you.
I don't drink.
What story?
The Duchess had a son, Giorgio.
Le bambino bello.
A beautiful child.
Well, why didn't he inherit all this?
He died when he was only five years old.
Five?
How did he die?
No one knows.
The husband of the Duchess.
She married an American after the war.
He abandoned her and his little boy.
Soon after that,
Giorgio was buried.
Then, the Duchess dismissed everybody and lived alone.
She never left the castle, for 42 years until she died.
Losing a child is the worst grief there is.
And the worst guilt.
When her American left her, the Duchess went pazzo.
Crazy.
Some in town, they say she took revenge and killed his son.
Jesus, it was her son, too.
Yes, it's against nature, against God.
Why are you telling me this?
Some in town, they also say that late at night, when the streets are quiet, you can hear Giorgio crying.
A child crying.
They say the castle is haunted.
Il libro è verde.
The book is green.
Il libro è verde.
Il libro è verde.
Il lago è azzurro.
The lake is blue.
Il lago è azzurro.
Il lago è azzurro.
Il fiore è rosso.
The flower is red.
Il fiore è rosso.
Sweetie, are you okay?
What's wrong?
I'm fine, really.
What kind of flowers are those?
Oh, I'm not sure, really.
I got them outside around the castle.
Hello, ladies.
I'm going to start making an inventory of what we got here.
The booty.
You want to tag along, Beck?
Get the lay of the land?
Sure!
Well, I'm not sure that's a good idea.
We'll stay on this floor.
Come on, Beck, let's go.
Here, be careful, okay?
Stop worrying so much, mom, we'll be fine.
Oh.
What?
It's a room full of toys, Beck.
It's a nursery, I think.
Here, Beck.
What?
What's that?
A horse.
A rocking horse.
Right.
Oh, wow!
What?
Let's set you down on this bed.
Right there.
While I look around for booty.
Oh, it looked like somebody lived in this room.
Now, if you were a Duchess, where would you hide your jewellery?
I don't know.
Under the bed?
Why not?
Worth a try.
Daddy!
Is it there?
No, sweetheart.
It's not there.
Just some junk.
Oh.
We keep looking.
Okay.
Daddy?
Do you hear anything like, scratching?
No.
Daddy?
Beck, just a second, please.
I'm looking at a few things.
Nice kitty.
Where are you?
Kitty?
Where are you going?
What do you want?
Where are you going, you crazy cat?
Beck?
Beck?
Rebecca?
This is silly.
Let's go back upstairs.
Wait!
What the heck is down here that's so important?
Oh, damn.
Oh, get out of here.
Go wherever you're going!
Jeez-louise.
Out of here.
Hello?
Oh.
Hello?
Is anybody there?
Is that just you, you stupid cat?
Anybody there?
Come here.
Here, kitty!
Come out of there, kitty.
Come here, kitty.
Rebecca?
Daddy?
Rebecca?
Kitty, come on, I gotta go.
Rebecca!
Down here, Daddy!
Daddy?
Daddy, I'm coming.
Daddy?
Daddy!
Daddy?
Rebecca, where have you been?
I heard your father calling for you!
Why aren't you with him?
There's somebody else here!
What?
What are you talking about?
What happened?
There was a door and I opened it, and I followed this cat downstairs.
Downstairs?
Becky, how could you be so stupid?
You could have been hurt!
Well, I kinda, you know --
Oh no, You are hurt.
It's just a cut.
- It's really no big deal.
- There you are!
God, Beck, where were you?
She's hurt, John, because you let her run off.
Beck, what did you do?
She was right with me.
Yeah, what's your excuse this time?
We can't watch her every minute.
Well, you can't, obviously, can you?
Listen, listen, there's somebody in the castle!
Rebecca, you have to promise me that you won't do anything like that again.
You mean walk around like a normal person?
Look, if you want to explore the castle or the town, then all you have to do is tell me, and I'll go with you.
Mom, it's, it's my handicap.
It's my challenge.
I have to deal with it myself.
I know you do, sweetie.
I know you do, I'm sorry.
You don't have any friends here, and you're--
A friend would believe me, Mom.
You've got to listen to me.
There's somebody else in the castle.
Enough of this, okay?
Come on, put your glasses on.
Let's go to lunch.
Now sweetie,
I want you to know that
I am your friend, and I'll always be your friend.
And I'll always take care of you.
And I think you're just projecting, because you want to have somebody else here with you.
Is there a cat in the house, Agnese?
No.
But Gabriella, she loved cats.
Gabriella, was that the Duchess?
Si.
Oh, did you know her?
Si, I was the maid in the castle when she was a young girl.
Oh, what was she like?
She always got what she wanted.
If she did not...
Was she pretty?
She was beautiful.
Bella!
What?
Like you.
Oh, you must eat, you are too thin.
Oh, tell her, Agnese.
She eats like a bird.
Americans don't eat enough.
To share food makes a family.
No?
My god, this mirror broke!
Oh, that's all we need.
Seven more years of bad luck.
No, no, no, no.
The wood warped.
These things are so old, or, maybe there was a sudden change of temperature.
Or somebody else is in the castle.
Who's there?
Who are you?
I know you're there.
Sweetheart, what is it?
What is it, who is here?
Sweetie, what's the matter?
You having a dream?
No, it's okay, it's okay.
I believe you.
I'm going to go look around.
No, daddy, please be careful!
It's okay.
- It's okay, sweetie.
- It's all right, sweetheart.
I'll be right back.
It's okay, it's okay, sweetie.
It's okay, I'm here.
It's okay.
JJ?
JJ.
My baby boy.
So, your daughter heard something in her room last night, and she sensed something downstairs before that.
Is that correct?
Yes.
But you found no one on this floor or below, when you went to look.
No, but I heard crying.
Did you hear crying, Signora Reilly?
Well, no, I didn't.
What?
What did he say?
He says, so the door are locked and this is not evidence of entering by force.
No one has come to the castle from the outside.
But you won't know that for certain until you search the place, right?
Castle D'Orsino has more than 150 rooms.
We cannot spare the men to search with such little evidence.
Well, my daughter said that she did hear something.
I'm certain she did.
A castle makes many sounds, especially at night.
Everybody thinks I made it up.
No, I think maybe you didn't understand.
No, I think maybe you don't understand.
We want you to search the castle!
What about--
What about this mirror?
How did you hurt your hand, Signor Reilly?
What are you saying?
Are you saying I did it myself?
Why would I break my own mirror?
Maybe you don't like what you saw.
Susan?
John!
She didn't get much sleep last night, you know.
None of us did, come on.
I want to show you something.
Why, what is it?
Please, you've got to see this.
Come on.
It's in here, Susan.
That's really weird.
It's gone.
There was a picture right there, of a little boy who looked like JJ.
John.
No, I swear.
He looked exactly like JJ.
It was right there.
It was Giorgio.
The Duchess' son.
Look at this, Susan.
He died when he was five.
John, stop it.
This isn't funny.
You know, when I found this place last night and this picture, I felt--
I felt like it was JJ.
What are you talking about?
I felt like JJ was here.
Well, I feel him...
- ...sometimes, too.
- No, no, no.
It's different than that.
He was here.
John.
I know, that's why I wanted the police to look around, so they could find something.
He's dead.
JJ's dead.
I know.
Stop it, you're acting like a child.
Jesus, I know he's dead,
I was there.
But listen to me.
His spirit, his ghost, was here, Susan.
Now, Agnese says that this castle is haunt--
No, it's your conscience, John.
You are just in such serious denial, you don't even realize it.
No, no, no, no.
This is different.
No, it's always the same.
It's never your fault.
Your father was responsible for your drinking problem.
The university fired you...
...because you were politically incorrect.
And now you're trying to use JJ's death--
No, I'm not!
Yes, you are!
It's not JJ's ghost, it's you, John.
It's you!
You were the one who was driving that car, drunk!
You blinded Becky!
You killed our son!
So what's left?
You just punishing me?
Yes, because God didn't.
He just let you walk away without a scratch.
Well, what do you want me to do?
I wish I could go back.
I wish it had been me.
Oh, so do I.
The international language, huh?
No, I'm sorry.
I don't smoke.
Sorry.
But, can I buy you a drink?
Can I buy you a drink?
Joe.
Give the lady whatever she wants.
You heard it.
Joe, give me another one.
What?
What, are you tryin'--
Oh, shit.
Oh, God.
I'm sorry, Joe.
I'm sorry.
He's trying to tell you that he's closing the bar.
Really?
You mean he's closing it to me.
You go home to your family.
Okay, okay, hold.
Listen up, I get it.
I'm going.
I've caused enough trouble as it is.
This is for your trouble, Joe.
Hey.
Oh, and that's for her, whatever she wants.
What?
I owe you a glass of wine, don't I?
I know where this nice quiet place, that's open all night.
Excellent.
Chateau Reilly.
Yes.
Quiet.
Sound travels in this place.
We don't want to be disturbed, right?
Okay?
Please.
You have to go.
I'm sorry.
No.
No, really, you were wonderful.
I just...
I have to go.
What?
What?
Centomila.
Of course.
Of course.
Here.
Well, just fucking take it.
No, take it please.
Just take it!
Oh!
Officer.
I came to see you,
Signor Reilly.
Alone, please.
Well, you'll see me, too.
What do you want?
We need your help to find Sylvana Lucci.
Who?
She didn't come home last night.
Well, I don't know anything about this.
The last time anyone saw her, she was going into the castle with you.
Well, she's not here, officer.
And no one here has seen her since last night?
I said she's not here.
Do you mind if I look inside?
Yesterday, you couldn't be bothered and now you want to look around.
Yesterday, you asked us to look and now you refuse?
Why shouldn't he look around, John?
Because he just wants to hassle me, that's why.
Sylvana Lucci has a small child.
So you see, a mother is missing.
Am I suspect?
Has there been a crime?
No, so there's no need for you to look around, is there?
Then you won't mind coming to the station to answer some questions?
I'm not going to answer any questions...
...until I talk to my lawyer.
You brought a woman here?
I was lonely.
You were drunk.
Sus...
You are not listening to me.
I am listening to you,
I just don't agree with you.
Mom, if he's drinking again, he'll need us more than ever.
I am tired, Becky.
I am just so tired, I--
I think if we stay together, one of us will go crazy.
If what you tell me, Giovanni, is all that happened, there is no evidence against you.
It is all that happened.
Then they will find
Sylvana Lucci... or they will find some explanation... and you'll be innocent.
You know of course, that the Signorina and carabinieri were lovers.
What?
She's a prostitute.
She must have screwed half the guys in this town.
Myself included.
But all the other men did not have a child with her.
She had his kid?
Yes.
He denies it, but everyone knows it's his.
He's a charming little boy.
Il telefono.
Don't worry, there is no evidence.
Excuse me.
Don't worry.
That was my sister calling from the castle.
She has found Sylvana Lucci's what do you call...
Handbag.
She must have left it.
That's not something a woman leaves.
I'm afraid now, they, they're going to arrest you.
What?
That's ridiculous.
I didn't do anything.
Yes, but the police find the handbag.
Oh, Jesus.
What are we going to do?
I'm your lawyer.
I believe you, but that is not evidence.
And then, carabinieri, they don't need to be told.
I swear,
I didn't do anything to her.
Then we agree.
I'll have Agnese bring me the handbag.
I'll keep it until they find Signora Lucci.
Then, all we'll have to discuss, is our new financial agreement.
What are you talking about?
Because of new problems with your case,
I must raise my fee.
That's blackmail.
You bastard.
I think it's time you learned the truth.
What?
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about your father's first wife.
It was a great scandal.
The Duchess D'Orsino married an American soldier.
What? What are you--
The Duchess?
Yes, they got married.
Then they had a child.
Then your father got tired of both of them, and he ran off with her younger sister to America.
No, my parents never said anything about this.
Why would they?
The Duchess would never give him a divorce.
She's nobility.
So, the marriage of your father with her sister was not legal, no good.
No!
Yes.
Your father was never married to your mother.
So, you, Giovanni, are the bastard.
Thank you.
Get in the car, Rebecca.
Susan!
I have to say goodbye.
No, get in the car.
Susan.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
We're leaving, John.
No, listen.
Listen, they're going to arrest me.
For what?
That woman is still missing.
I need your help.
You brought a whore into our home, John.
Into our home, with Becky there.
Look, I know that but if you leave me, it's going to look like I'm guilty.
I should have left you two years ago.
Susan, please!
I'm begging you.
You made yourself into a whipping boy, John.
Don't blame me.
Go.
Whipping boy?
Whipping boy.
Why would she have a whip?
Susan!
I think I know what happened, what's happening.
And I can prove it!
Bye Daddy!
I'll see you again sweetheart, I promise!
Yes?
I'm sorry, Signora Reilly but we must take your husband to the Carabinieri station to answer some questions.
Oh, well, I'm sure he'll be able to explain himself.
We must also search the castle.
Fine, do whatever you have to do.
My daughter and I are catching the train to Rome.
I must ask you both to stay in Orsino.
We will require statements from you.
But we don't know anything about any of this.
But you understand that we must ask.
And first we have to talk to your husband.
We are grateful for your cooperation.
Well, don't be.
You're keeping us here against our will.
Where is Agnese?
I don't know, really.
We wanted to say goodbye, but we couldn't find her.
Where are the stairs, please?
Somebody needs to stay with my daughter.
He's a policeman honey, he'll stay with you, okay.
It's alright.
Grimaldi.
What's going on mom?
John.
What are you doing?
Rebecca is right.
There is someone else in the castle.
God, forgive you.
It is nothing but rocks.
He's not here.
Who, Signor.
Giorgio D'Orsino, he was never buried.
She kept him alive.
He's alive.
Don't you see?
He's here.
He's here somewhere in the castle.
Where is my sister?
I don't know where your sister is.
Maybe he took her.
Come with us, Signora Reilley.
What?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
No, no, no, no.
Listen to me.
Wait a minute.
Check upstairs, in the Duchess's room.
She has a whip.
Why would she have a whip?
Who's she going to use it on?
Think, for Christ's sake.
She never let anyone in, right?
But who was here to begin with, at the start?
Her son, he didn't die.
She had him hid away.
She made him into a whipping boy to get back at my father for leaving her.
Very clever.
He's the one that broke the mirror.
He's the one that was in
Rebecca's room, I'm telling you.
You've got to search the castle.
Oh my God.
You are under arrest.
What?
I didn't do this.
Why would I do this?
You should be careful what you say, until you talk to your lawyer.
Susan, I didn't do this.
I swear, I need your help.
Please, I know it.
I need your help, I'm innocent.
I didn't do it!
Please, go back.
Yes?
Grimaldi and Benedetti will stay here tonight.
You can bring your daughter to the station tomorrow, and give your testimony.
Alright, thank you.
You alright?
Okay.
Buona notte.
Goodnight.
Could you get us some water?
Acqua, per favore.
Acqua, si.
Can you get someone in here who speaks English?
English!
Damn it!
It's okay.
Officer.
Officer, would you please listen to me.
Then you are prepared to answer some questions.
I will answer any questions that you want, but you have got to get my family out of that castle.
Why?
Why, because there is a madman in there and my family is in danger.
And who is this madman,
Giorgio D'Orsino?
You saw the coffin.
You saw that it was empty.
Why would the Duchess bury an empty coffin?
That was 40 years ago.
I want more about last night.
Why did you kill Sylvana?
I keep telling you over, and over, and over again.
I didn't kill her!
It was him!
No more fairy tales.
Tell me the truth.
Hello!
Yes.
We asked for water.
Acqua, do you know if it's coming?
Yes, acqua, acqua.
I go, I go.
Thank you.
Benedetti!
It's coming, Sweetie.
Benedetti!
Bene...
We're going to get through this, sweetie.
You'll see.
We're going to be home, soon.
Do you really think daddy's a murderer?
You do.
You think he killed JJ.
I thought you guys must love JJ more than me.
What, why would you say that?
Because you hate each other so much, since he died.
Oh, sweetie.
We both love you so much, you know that, don't you?
I know.
And no matter what, your father needs our prayers.
So pray with me, okay.
Heavenly father, please watch over us, and protect us in this time of trouble.
And help my mother forgive my father.
And God, please help us put our family back together.
- Amen.
- Amen.
We'll figure out what to do in the morning, okay.
I think I'm getting one of my headaches.
Okay, I have your pills right here.
I just thought that we'd never get back to normal.
Where's that water?
Mom, are you listening to me?
Yes sweetie, I'm listening.
I don't care that things won't be normal again.
Normal sucks.
Becky.
No, really.
Well, I don't have to worry about all that stupid stuff, like cars and prom and stuff.
When I get a boyfriend, automatically be a special person because he won't care that I'm blind.
And I'll have to judge him by what he's really like not by what he looks like.
It'll have to be love, the real thing.
Mom?
It's you!
Help!
Please.
Please, I have answered all of your questions.
And now I want you to get my daughter and my wife out of that castle, now.
You don't give orders here. and you will answer questions until we are satisfied with your answers.
Now, tell me again, why did you kill Sylvana?
I didn't kill her,
I fucked her, okay.
No!
Why are you doing this to me?
What do you want?
Please, let me go.
Please.
The police are here.
They'll find you, they will.
No, no!
Stop!
Mom!
Let her go.
Let her go!
Take me.
No, mom, no!
Come on, take me.
Take me!
Run, mom, run!
Get up, get up, come on!
Oh no.
Mom, look at him, he's coming.
Giorgio!
John!
Daddy!
John.
John!
Daddy!
John.
John.
Forgive me.
I'm sorry.
John, I love you.
I...
I love you.
Moving to new frequency. Solar interference. 
Incoming transport detected. 
Docking procedures engaged. 
Thermal sensors detect humanoids, level 36.
Humanoids advancing, deck 47.
 Long wait, demon,
for such a short game. 
Now curiosity is satisfied. 
And it's time... 
for revenge. 
Dr. Merchant, consider yourself relieved. 
 What else, Chamberlain?
He's rerouted all available power to his personal quarters... and he's shut down most of the ship.
I want you to check everything out and find out why.
Yes, sir.
So, we have the company's most productive space station... hijacked and taken out of orbit by the man who built it.
We have the man himself immersed in ancient history,
letting the whole place go to shit. 
- Evaluation?
- Wacko.
I wasn't asking you, Carducci. 
I was asking the expert. 
Well, Rimmer?
Great man didn't live up to your expectations, did he?
I'm sure he will, sir, as soon as I can begin my interrogation.
Where's your crew?
I made them leave. They're headed for
Earth. Look, time is of the essence. 
Was there some technical problem?
No. Yes.
Yes, that's it.
There's been a technical problem, and you... all of you have to get the fuck off this station right now.
- When we go, you come with us.
- No, you don't understand.
Help me, then.
What's your name?
Rimmer.
I'm playing the endgame here, Rimmer, finishing something that began centuries ago, and I don't have the time to help you understand.
You don't know what you're playing with. 
What are you afraid of?
Whatever it is, it's here... in this station.
That and things your little rational mind couldn't even dream of.
But I dream.
Oh, I dream.
Parker was right. 
You are crazy. 
I built this place for a reason:
To create the biggest trap in the galaxy.
- What did you expect to catch?
- Hell is what I'm going to catch.
And I'm going to burn it away in a blaze of light.
You're serious, aren't you?
If I tell you the whole story,
will you let me finish what I began?
Centuries ago, a man, an ancestor of mine,
Phillip L'Merchant,
built a puzzle box, the first box,
his finest work. 
Commissioned by a wealthy aristocrat named De L 'Isle,
a man obsessed with black magic,
a leader of the occult. 
Phillip was so proud of his work,
a work that would establish his name,
his family... my family. 
He didn't know the great power the box held... 
and the unspeakable things it would release...
the evil,
the sins,
the pain. 
- Is it done?
- Done.
- Is it wonderful?
- Wonderful.
Are you brilliant?
The finest toy maker in France.
Oh, what does it do?
Oh. It doesn't actually do anything. 
It's my masterpiece.
You simply couldn't understand.
I was working to a commission to a very specific request.
It's almost midnight. 
Where are you going?
- The Chateau De L'Isle, to deliver the box.
- Now? Why?
Because my work might be appreciated there.
It's late.
Stay with me.
Stay with us.
I must go.
My son will be born in a better place than this.
This is only the beginning.
I can feel it.
All alone in this dark, dark world.
No home, no family. 
Not even christened,
I understand.
 Jacques,
show this child to a chair. 
Enjoy.
Careful!
I'd be mortified if you sliced your little finger.
Such a gentleman.
Are you always such a gentleman?
No.
Not always.
Monsieur De L 'Isle is
France's greatest magician. 
- What is this?
- So you don't bruise.
Easy, Jacques. 
Keep the pressure steady. 
She has spirit.
Splendid.
Now we can begin.
Ahh, L'Merchant.
As precise as your pieces.
As timely as your toys.
And where is the box?
Pay him, Jacques. 
Thank you.
Good night, toy maker. 
Take her in to the laboratory.
Find the right instrument. 
We must make a clean... incision... 
so that we can remove the innards... 
so we can replace the flesh again. 
Yes, the gizzard. 
We'll scrub this.
Now we can raise her up off the ground. 
That's it. 
Walk now amongst us!
-  My God. 
- Fear not, Jacques. 
Remember your lessons.
A summoned demon is yours to command.
Unless you stand in hell's way. 
Yes.
He who summons the magic...
commands the magic. 
You are... 
Angelique. 
He who summons the magic...
Commands the magic.
 'Tis no story, Auguste. 
I saw what I saw, heard what I heard. 
The box opens the doors to hell. 
This is the 18th century,
Phillip, not the dark ages.
The world is ruled by reason. 
We even got rid of God.
And if there is no heaven, then it follows reasonably... that there is no hell.
I was at its very window last night!
Very well.
Suppose, for the sake of argument,
that what you fear happened has happened. 
A box that can open the gates of hell must be able to close them.
The box belongs to people with little interest in closing such doors.
Well, then the solution lies literally in your hands.
You've designed a machine that you fear can bring forth demons.
- Yes.
- Then design a machine that can destroy them.
Phillip had the design. 
That design. 
It seemed an impossible task. 
But he had to try, try something.
And his only hope was to steal the box, the puzzle box that he had created with his own hands.
 Unbutton my shirt. 
Yes. 
Turn around. 
Oh, yes. 
Toy maker, you have such pliant fingers. 
I want them to play with me. 
And take my soul?
It's already gone, toy maker.
Demons will walk the Earth, and you're responsible.
Think of that.
You and your bloodline cursed 'til the end of time because of your little puzzle box.
What are you waiting for? Kill him and come back where you belong.
Such pliant fingers.
My God!
Please forgive me.
I didn't know what I was doing.
We've got to get you out of here.
It's too late.
They're back. Save yourself. 
Save the child.
Jacques was right.
Demons did walk the Earth, the same way they're walking this station right now.
From a puzzle box?
Angelique had many boxes made from his design,
but it wasn't enough. 
She wanted a box that would open the gateway forever. 
- And your family?
- Was the key. 
But they treated it the same way you treat it.
Like a fairy tale.
But their blood remembered.
And as the generations passed, there were Merchants who dreamed of puzzle boxes... and doors leading to hell.
And then one of them met... Angelique... much, much later.
Even in sleep, you want me.
Even in dreams, you watch me.
Yes, I know.
I know what's in your heart.
John Merchant.
Look at me, look at me, look at me.
Are you okay?
Oh, God, I woke Jack again.
Mommy! Mommy!
You look terrible.
I'm worried, and I really think you should see someone.
You know I've been having these dreams all my life.
John, honey, they're getting worse.
It is your goddamned grandmother.
She was weird, John.
You remember those stories about how, how important you are and how important the family is?
Honey, she put stuff in your mind.
Not all of it.
There are other things.
Things that feel like memories, impossible memories.
And they just don't haunt my dreams, they haunt my work.
- Everything that I've done...
- I don't want you haunted, and I don't want you hurt.
It's not that.
It's... It's stress.
It's this this banquet thing. 
I hate crap like this!
Oh.
Then you shouldn't be so good.
- But it's not ready. I'm not sure if it will work. 
- Right.
So that's why your face is on this magazine cover. 
L'Merchant!
The bloodline continues, toy maker.
I'm restless, and you're bored.
I think we should see America.
Screw America.
Then I would like your permission to go by myself.
Don't you want to know why I'd like to go?
Is that your final word?
Angelique, let's make this clear.
What you want is irrelevant.
It's about what I want.
After 200 years, you should know what those things are.
Jacques, have I ever disappointed you?
- No.
- Close your eyes.
- Don't move.
- Why?
So you won't bruise.
- Is this a new game?
- Oh, yes.
It might hurt... 
Just a little.
 Jacques, do you remember
De L 'Isle's lesson?
Perhaps I was a bit hasty.
Enjoy.
I forget. 
You like it rough, don't you?
Please!
Yes, you like it rough!
It hurts. 
It hurts.
Oh, please. Please.
You broke the number-one rule, Jacques.
You tried to stand in hell's way.
What are you talking about?
The toy maker's bloodline has survived.
The box.
America.
 It's both my pleasure and honor...  to present this award on behalf of the architectural community... to Mr. John Merchant.
John.
Thank you.
I've always thought that the... applause from your peers is the best kind of applause, and I am truly touched by, uh, your reception... and by this award.
Originally, when I had put myself...
Leonardo da Vinci once said that no work of art... is ever completed, only abandoned.
And I never understood what he meant until now.
Thank you.
Good night.
Very nice speech.
Honey, it's okay. 
Let's just go. 
 Toy maker. 
 I know I brought it with me. 
- Idiot!
- I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.
- I didn't even see you.
- Oh, forgive me.
- I'm very sorry.
- That was very rude.
Now I'll have to think of a way to make it up to you.
Why are we going to the basement?
At least tell me your name. 
Do we really need to know each other's names?
Mystery woman, huh?
Aren't you excited by mystery?
Ooh, yeah. You bet.
You seem to be pretty familiar with this place.
I'm just following my instincts.
Do you like games?
You're a dream.
Almost.
Close your eyes. 
Trust me. 
Okay.
What's going on?
Can I look now?
You can look now. 
Time to play another game.
I have such sights to show you.
All right.
What's happening?
Angelique.
Things seem to have changed.
Hell is more ordered since your time, Princess.
And much less amusing.
- The box did this?
- A man did this. 
But the box called him.
It called to his blood.
His ancestor made the box...
and would have unmade all of us. 
You've been away too long,
Princess.
This is not a room.
This is a holocaust... waiting to wake itself.
If we could just move this whole thing right up... to give it a little more height.
- There's a woman here to see you.
- Tell her to have a seat, okay?
- Okay.
-  John Merchant and Associates. 
I know you.
You've no idea what a pleasure it is to meet you again.
This is all very good.
You're the one we've been waiting for.
Who are you?
A friend, I hope.
A client, I'm sure.
Is this yours?
No.
This has been in my family for hundreds of years.
I'm working on something based on it. 
- May I see it?
- Nobody's seen it.
Then let me be the first.
To put it simply, it's something
I want to do with mirrors and lasers. 
See, in theory, it's possible.
Perpetual light.
Trapped light feeding off its own reflections. 
 I haven't perfected the light yet. 
Something's missing, and I can't make it work. 
It'll go for a few seconds...  then it'll blink out.
Sometimes a few seconds are more than enough,
toy maker. 
What did you call me?
You think you don't remember, but your blood knows.
Let it remind you.
- Angelique.
- You know me from dreams.
John Merchant.
John L'Merchant.
We have a destiny... together.
I don't believe in destiny.
You think your work on the building was an accident?
It called to you, John.
We have great work to do.
I shall be in touch.
Whatever you want.
Whatever you want.
What time is it?
- Hello.
- L'Merchant.
I have to see you.
-  Can we meet? Today. 
-  Yeah. Okay. 
-  We'll go over it tomorrow. 
- At your office.
Okay. Bye.
Business.
Some Japanese client.
Got no sense of time.
I grow impatient with the Princess.
Human acquiescence is as easily obtained by terror... as by temptation.
- New building.
- Must be.
- Settling?
- Yeah. Settling.
Still hungry?
Ready for something that screams?
 So she starts asking me all kinds of weird questions. 
Like what?
Like, would I do it with a woman that used to be a man?
- Like with a guy that had it cut off?
- Yeah.
Hormones, the whole bit.
- So, what'd you say?
- I mean, I guess so.
If she was cut and all.
- What's this?
- It's a door.
I know it's a door, but it isn't on the chart. 
Genius college boys.
A pity the mirror will not show your true beauty, Princess.
Your human admirer may not sense it, but I can smell the exquisite stench... of what you really are!
 You know, I'm starting not to like this so much. 
- You know, I was just thinking the same thing.
- Well, maybe...
Shit!
- We should check it out. 
- Speak for yourself.
This is getting weird.
You coming?
Go ahead. 
Check it out. 
Well, at least watch my back.
You got it.
You look like death, Princess.
Temptation is illusion.
But the time for trickery is past.
In this game, we show ourselves as we really are.
What's that?
The beauty of suffering.
You are no different from that beast... that sucks the bones you throw to it.
And you, Princess.
What are you?
You scared the shit out of me, man! What's wrong with you?
My flashlight died.
I tripped and fell.
From now on, we stick together. Always. 
Together. Right.
Someone's messing with our heads.
 Freeze!
- Just back it up against the wall!
- You heard him. Back it up!
Don't make us put some pain on you.
Pain?
How dare you use that word.
He's got pins in his head.
What you think of as pain... is only a shadow.
Pain has a face.
Allow me to show it to you.
Gentlemen,
I... am... pain.
I know your fear.
I hear it.
"Please, don't separate me from my brother. "
I give you my word... 
that will never happen. 
A lesson, Princess.
Work with me, or for me. 
Temptation is worthless,
Princess.
Suffering is the coin of the realm. 
I will teach your human Merchant about the value of suffering.
I will buy his secret... with a bounty of pain.
They say the greatest suffering...  a parent can know... is the loss of a child.
Honey, Mommy'll be back in five minutes, okay?
- Jack.
- Mom, I'm concentrating.
-  I don't know what I'm doing here. 
-  I had to see you. 
Whatever you want.
We were good together, John.
Yes.
We will be again.
 Mommy!
Oh, God!
Oh, thank God!
-  Jack, honey, baby, come here. 
- I can't, Mommy.
He won't let me.
What, baby?
- Mom. 
- Oh, God.
Young... unformed.
Oh, what appetites
I could teach him.
Just give him to me, please!
Oh, you suffer beautifully.
But I am here for business, not pleasure.
- Just tell me what you want.
- Oh, I want bait.
Live bait.
Bobbi! Jack!
Bobbi!
You stay here.
Oh, thank God. 
John, don't!
Easy. 
I don't know who or what you are... and I don't care.
I just want my wife and my kid back!
Oh, I understand... how you love this boy.
You have plans for him. 
Hopes and dreams. 
A whole imagined future... where you love him and watch him grow.
- Yes.
- Then complete your work.
Or, though the boy will not die here, for a thousand years his dearest wish will be that he had!
For God's sake!
Do I look like someone who cares what God thinks?
Just tell me what you want.
The box.
Apathway to hell...  made by an ancestor of yours.
The room downstairs... potentially a bigger pathway.
You will help... to fulfill its promise.
Come on!
Come on, Jack.
This way.
Come on!
- We're gonna split up. Take the other stairwell.
- What?
I've got a plan. Jack, it'll be okay.
All right? You can do it.
Come on, you bastard.
It's me you want.
Don't flatter yourself. 
I don't want you, child.
I want what you were born with: A gift.
The lights.
Oh, no. Not light. 
Darkness is where you find me. 
Good. 
Stand your ground. 
Family man.
The box, once thought so powerful, is only a model.
What you will give me is the true version. 
No longer will we have to seep into your world... like pests through cracks in the baseboards.
Once and for all, we will open the gates, lay low the ramparts.
Isn't that what the Princess wants from you?
Isn't that the game that you two have been playing?
- This isn't a game.
- Oh, yes.
This is a game.
And now it is time... to play.
I shall go first.
Daddy!
Run!
It is time to open the pathway... forever.
That's impossible!
No. No!
Does this pathway work both ways?
Toy maker. 
Come here, Jack!
So young.
So tender.
- So ripe.
-  Daddy!
- Get your hands off of him!
- Get your hands on the console, toy maker.
You have work to do. 
 Open the pathway for me!
The toy maker's design.
Do it!
- Jack!
- Daddy!
- Run, Jack!
- No more games.
- Jack!
- Mommy!
You go play with your dog, you bastard!
The boy lived.
He carried the bloodline, the guilt for what our family had begun.
And how to undo it.
Did he carry that too?
Yes. It was passed down through the generations.
It came upon me first in my dreams.
My blood was speaking to me while I slept, telling me to make good the damage
L'Merchant had done... all those centuries ago.
Dr. Merchant, what were you doing... when Parker and I found you in your cabin?
Summoning a demon or two. 
Maybe more.
- And did you succeed?
- Oh, yes. 
It was much easier than I thought.
Merchant, do you hear me?
I know you're watching.
We'd almost given up waiting for you to play.
Long wait, demon, for such a short game.
Short? Ohh.
Is that any way to treat an old friend of the family?
No. Tell the truth,
Merchant. 
You're pleased to see me.
Your impatience... has matched my own.
Perhaps.
But now curiosity is satisfied.
And it's time for revenge. 
Dr. Merchant, consider yourself relieved. 
Not now.
I let them out!
What's wrong with this is I don't believe in hell.
But it believes in you, and it's out there right now. 
I don't frighten easily.
Well, stop thinking and start feeling!
Your gut knows that I'm telling you the truth.
There's something in this station right now that wants our souls.
And whether you believe in hell or not, it's gonna take us there.
Solar alignment in place. 
- Twenty-three minutes to complete mission. -
Please... get off this station.
Let me save at least one soul.
We go together, or we don't go at all.
Then we go together.
Just let me finish.
Rimmer, we're pulling out as soon as
Parker finishes checking Merchant's cabin.
Get him out of there now.
You don't know what they're capable of!
Rimmer, escort the prisoner to his cell and prepare to leave at 04:30 hours.
What the...
 Help! Help!
- Save me! Hurry!
- My God!
- We're trapped!
- Hurry!
Help!
Get us out of here!
Hurry!
In here!
What the hell is this?
The remnants of a most unsatisfying victim. 
Still...  you're here to change all that.
Aren't you?
 Merchant has a plan. 
Kill them all.
I keep trying to raise Parker.
He's not responding.
- I'm going to go check it out.
- He's dead!
And if you don't let me out to finish my work, you're all dead!
Chamberlain.
Parker's dead.
- What?
- Parker's dead. 
Oh, God.
Don't know what the hell's going on.
Just remember:
Shoot first.
Out. 
Help me, please!
Please, help me!
Please.
Help me.
Mr. Chamberlain?
What the fuck planet are you from?
Come on. 
- Can you still do it? Can you stop them?
- I can try.
I need a couple of minutes to get the coordinates locked in from here.
Give you a chance to get to the ship.
Go. Now!
-  We can't leave without Carducci. 
- Carducci, come in!
I'm going after him.
Get to the ship.
That weapon will not protect you!
But I know something that will.
Oh, no.
He said it could protect me.
He told me what to do. 
Please, go ahead.
It's a box.
It's just a box. 
Thank God for men of reason.
 Finish it. 
Now the final movement begins. 
Soon the bloodline will be severed.
You and your ancestors have proved worthy opponents.
The taste of victory... is almost bittersweet.
Glorious, is it not?
Perfect. 
The creatures that walk on its surface, always looking to the light, never seeing the untold oceans of darkness beyond.
There are more humans alive at this moment...  than in all its pitiful history.
The Garden of Eden.
A garden of flesh.
Nowhere to run this time, toy maker. 
No escape.
Double back down this hallway and get to the shuttle.
- You've got five minutes, Rimmer.
- Together, you said.
- I'm not done here.
- Well, then, I don't go.
I'm coming right after you.
Just be ready.
We're not gonna have much time once this thing goes.
Trust me.
I'm not going to sacrifice myself if I can help it. 
I'm not that crazy.
Oh, my God.
Here, doggie.
Play dead.
 Dr. Merchant, two minutes to complete mission. 
Two minutes.
Two centuries.
It all ticks by so quickly.
You are so very like your ancestor.
Did you know that?
I have the distinct sense of deja vu.
The same defiance, the same faithless hope in the light.
- And what do you have faith in?
- Nothing. 
I am so exquisitely empty.
Then it won't hurt you to die.
Will it?
I cannot die.
I am forever.
 Dr. Merchant, one minute to complete mission. 
Where are you, toy maker?
Here.
Hologram. See, it's all done with mirrors. 
Like this.
What have you done?
I have faith in the light.
- What?
- The light, demon. The light. 
- Endgame, demon.
- No!
I cannot die!
 Welcome to oblivion. 
I thought we were gonna play ball.
Come on.
Come on!
Stay, Bo-jay
Hey, Mr Higgins.
Did you see something come down ten minutes ago?
Yeah. It's in the clearing.
It's really incredible.
Come on, you have to come see it.
It's just through here.
- Sam. Great to see you. How are you?
- Mr Jarvis.
This is Dr Sefton.
- Mary. Hi.
- Sam. Hi.
- What the hell's he doing here?
- This is important, Sam.
- Sorry about the short notice.
- No problem.
They have their IDs?
So I'm a Cavanaugh now.
We're tourists. If anyone asks,
I'm Charles Cavanaugh.
Dr Sefton is your sister.
My sister?
Of whom you are extremely fond in a clean-cut, healthy, all-American way.
- Where's my sister been all my life?
- Dr Sefton is on loan from NASA.
Jarvis, get the trunk for me, will you?
Since when did the office start drafting civilians?
All you need to know is that in the scheme of things, she is much more valuable to us than you are.
I take it you're as valuable as ever?
Naturally.
So if you two are being shot at, which bullet do I take?
You must try for both, of course.
What's so important to draw you out of your office and into the field?
Something unusual was reported entering our atmosphere last night.
One of our Keyhole satellites picked this up.
- You wanna give me a hint?
- See the little blur, top left?
Yeah.
The analysts speculate that's where the UFO may have landed.
- That's all we have?
- We immediately sent in two agents.
Deitman and Truly.
They have not reported back and we have not been able to contact them.
Peripheral reports?
The usual ground sightings.
Reports of a landing.
Then a local TV station sent in a mobile unit to do a spot-cast.
And they reported that indeed a UFO had landed.
An hour later they changed their tune.
Claimed it was a hoax.
A fraud perpetrated by a couple of farm boys who built this spaceship.
Nice sign.
- You go ahead. I'll catch up.
- OK.
Tell me, Mary, what exactly do you do for NASA?
- My speciality's exobiology.
- Exobiology?
It's the study of what alien life forms might be like.
You make a living at that?
Seems it'd be mostly guesswork.
We used to joke in school that ours was the only science without a subject matter.
So you people are with the office of scientific intelligence.
Till two days ago
I hadn't heard of it.
You wouldn't have.
Our existence isn't public knowledge.
Eisenhower started O-SCI back in '59.
We're an offshoot of the CIA, but the old man runs it like his own private dictatorship.
- Pay for this, will you, Sam?
- Sure, Charles.
Three for the... flying saucer.
What do you hear, Sam?
No birds.
Right. No birds.
Care to see inside, sir?
Only a buck more.
That's a bargain.
Let's have a look, shall we?
Sure.
Hi.
Let's see... Three dollars.
There you go.
How much have you made so far?
About $320.
I'll go first.
Thanks.
Could you help me here?
Thanks.
Thank you.
Let's go, lady.
I'm trying to run a business here.
It doesn't look safe.
It is. We've been taking people through all day.
She balked at the Pirates of the Caribbean.
Come on.
Keep the money, guys.
We're running late.
Come on.
Come on.
Thanks, guys.
- Well, Charles?
- Wait a minute.
Couldn't see anything, but there was definitely something strange going on.
What about the burn marks?
The burn marks were real.
Something landed there, but not that thing.
Why that thing?
Why the cover-up? Go on, Mary.
There was something odd about those boys. And the men.
What, precisely?
I know this doesn't necessarily qualify as scientific evidence, but a woman is used to a certain response from men, and from those boys
I didn't even get the automatic...
When I was introduced to Sam, he did this.
I did not do that.
Based on what I was doing with my blouse, they should have tried to look down my top...
Wouldn't have had to try very hard.
We'll go to the TV station that broadcast those conflicting reports.
Try something and let me know if you get the same reaction.
- Yes.
- Let's go.
- I did that when we first met?
- You're still doing it.
- Stay by the car.
- I'll keep it up there and wait.
That's fine.
The FCC does not take misrepresentation lightly, Mr Barnes.
We made an explanation over the air.
What else do you want?
We fell victim to a practical joke.
It was a mistake.
We're only human, after all.
Damn. Could I borrow your pen?
Well, I've seen the site.
I find it difficult to imagine that a couple of farm boys could have pulled off a hoax like that on their own.
Are you implying that my station was in on it?
Be realistic.
Hold it!
He's still moving.
- My God!
- Well, well, well.
- What the hell is that?
- Our visitor, I presume.
Careful.
No! Sam!
I want to take it back.
Give me that case.
Thank you for your cooperation,
Mr Barnes.
We will be in touch with you as soon as I complete the investigation.
They're on their way right now.
Let's go, Sam.
Sorry.
This way.
Billy, they're coming through.
Stop them, Billy.
... you can stay calm, those around you will react...
Especially if you have children.
Once...
Could I see some ID, please, sir?
Sam, you drive. Jarvis, get in the car.
Get away from the car, officer.
Get in the car.
He's on the car, Sam!
Get out!
- Get out.
- Get him off!
Get him off.
It's the kid from the spaceship.
- Get him off the car.
- Jarvis, help him.
My God.
- Sam. You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.
Make sure Langley understands we must stop this before it spreads.
I want that town sealed up completely.
Put up perimeter roadblocks...
Not local police.
They have been compromised.
Right?
The troops you send in must put up a challenge at 100 yards and shoot anyone who comes closer than 50 yards.
Get Holland to take a hazard response team and investigate the landing site.
There is no time to waste...
- Thanks.
- Sure.
We should exercise extreme caution.
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
What wasn't?
First contact.
What did you expect? ET?
No, but it would have been nice.
I never liked that little troll.
He's in his element. He's only really happy during a crisis.
Yeah. Alive.
A little tense between you two?
Yeah, well, he's my father.
This is incredible.
- Graves.
- Quite incredible.
Plenty of time for amazement later.
Right now I need facts.
OK, here's one. It's dead.
Are you sure?
No body heat, no electrical activity and no movement.
If we vented the chamber, it'd be pretty ripe in there.
We gave it quite a jolt of electrical current.
Probably vascular collapse, although most parasites, when separated...
Dr Sefton will define what we're dealing with.
Right. How do you want to handle this?
We need to know how the creature interfaces with our nervous system.
We should split into teams, each focusing on a different aspect of the alien.
Biochemistry, physiology, reproduction.
- Endocrinology...
- Wait a minute.
What we need to know is who we're fighting and how to fight them.
Is that clear to both of you?
It's one o'clock. In two hours
I'm calling a meeting at the office.
Make sure you have something for me by then.
Brad, cover.
OK, Jim, tape this.
And get a water sample.
I'll be damned.
- Do you want me to wait?
- No. I'll check you out later.
- Any trouble in Iowa?
- Not like you people had.
I heard you had to take a couple of people out.
These weren't people any more.
You shoot, they just keep on coming.
Any word on Deitman and Truly?
- Has anyone told their wives yet?
- Not yet.
So what are we looking at here?
It seemed something organic had eaten its way into the earth below the water table.
Now, whatever was hiding in that fake saucer was moved.
A hole filled with water was left.
What's your guess? How many of those things could have been in that hole?
Based on the size of the cavity, could have been thousands.
I don't know if this counts for anything, but... that kid said 320 people had gone through that ship about 11 hours ago.
What's the population of Ambrose?
- All right, Mary, let's go.
- OK.
Please keep in mind we were a little rushed.
Here's the creature, with an incision along its ventral surface.
The first thing that stands out is the complexity of its neo-cortex.
In a human, brain tissue accounts for about 5%% of total body mass.
But in this creature, and here's the brain tissue, it accounts for about 60%% .
This black tentacle, which we saw jet across Barnes's office, contains a probe. An interface between the creature and its host.
The probe penetrates the brain while these hooks here and here lock into the spinal column.
Together they override the human nervous system.
Wait. Are you saying that these slugs are using us like puppets?
Exactly.
You didn't mention whether the creature has eyes. Does it?
We haven't been able to locate any sensory organs.
Anything else?
We found human DNA and protein inside the creature.
They're able to adapt to whichever life form they're riding on.
We breathe oxygen so they breathe oxygen.
The two systems merge.
Can't we exploit this potential weakness?
What affects the host might also affect the parasite.
We must find something they're vulnerable to and we're not.
The people being ridden seemed stronger than normal.
We think they boost adrenaline production into their host.
Like injecting nitro into a car's fuel line.
The car will run faster but the engine will burn out sooner.
It's really quite a remarkable organism.
Much more efficient than anything on earth.
Look how elegant the cartilaginous structure is.
Incredible. It doesn't use haemoglobin in oxygen transport.
It uses a chlorophyll derivative.
Jeez, Graves. He sounds like he wants to fuck the thing.
Shut up, Holland.
Dr Sefton, do you have any idea how we should proceed?
This was a preliminary postmortem...
When did you quit smoking?
- Must have left them in the car.
- Stop him!
Jesus. He's got one on him!
Security!
Alex, go upstairs!
Secure the exit.
Bonnie, call 334, main gate.
- Come on, upstairs.
- Main gate.
Alex!
- Where is it?
- I don't know.
- Harris, get a medic.
- Right.
- Sam?
- We got him.
I guess that thing jumped onto whoever it ran into.
Put your gun down, Sam. Slowly.
Take off your shirt.
Thank you.
Well, let's find it.
Search everybody.
Right, everyone's accounted for.
- One of the aliens...
- This was on Jarvis.
It contains every emergency contingency we've drawn up since '59.
One of the alien life forms is loose in the building.
We have to presume that it's riding on the back of one of us.
Sam, show them your back.
Sam is clean.
Holland. Gorman.
Miss Haines. Everybody.
Miss Haines. Everybody.
What about you, sir?
Yeah, she's right. You're not exempt.
Stop her!
Gannet, Beasley, come on!
Miss Haines!
Miss Haines! Come back here!
Let go of me!
- They're down in the kitchen.
- Hurry up! Let's go down!
Damn! I lost it!
Forget it. Forget it.
I lost it.
It was too quick.
It went up through there.
I want that thing found tonight.
Turn the building upside down, but find it.
- Miss Haines?
- Sam, get cleaned up.
I want every second of Jarvis's time accounted for.
I want to know everything he was up to since we left Iowa.
Go and get a medic, will you?
God...
He's been like this since you brought him in.
In many ways he's exhibiting classic withdrawal symptoms, much like you'd find in a drug addict.
Are you saying he was actually addicted to having that thing on him?
No, he's saying that the presence of the thing satisfies some need or other.
Thanks, doc.
Jarvis is cold turkey and Miss Haines is in a coma.
- All victims will react this way?
- How would you react?
One minute you have this huge brain, the next moment you don't.
Think of it.
It'd be a lot easier if they had a live specimen to work with.
- What do you think these things are?
- Let's have a look.
They almost look like antennae.
What are they receiving?
Or transmitting, for that matter.
Radar, maybe. Or sonar signals, like bats.
Do you think that's how the aliens are able to recognise each other?
Yeah?
- You're the manager of the building?
- Yeah. Can I help you?
I need to get inside the apartment of Neil Jarvis.
Yeah, sure.
Just a second.
I'll be right with you.
Do you have a crowbar?
No, I got the keys.
Up this way.
Anybody here?
Hello?
These arrived this morning for
Mr Jarvis.
- I let the delivery people in.
- Give me a hand.
Yeah, sure.
Iowa. I wonder what that's all about.
What the hell are those things?
The president's scheduled appearance at the digital age conference
has drawn harsh criticism from Senator Allen,
who categorised the visit as blatant grandstanding.
Make sure the magnetometer's cranked up early. We don't want delays.
Has headquarters given us the name of our post standers?
Yes.
I need more agents on that balcony.
- And all along this perimeter.
- OK.
Long time no see.
Good to see you, Bruce. This is
Evan Greenberg, one of my agents.
- How are you, Evan?
- Hi.
What brings you down here?
I understand the president is scheduled to appear here.
If everything goes as planned.
There's a situation developing that I think you need to know about.
Can we talk in private?
Yeah. Come on.
OK. Now, Sam, what's this all about?
What the hell are you doing?
Please take your seats. The opening session is about to begin.
- Good to see you.
- Welcome, Mr President. This way.
Get him.
Alpha One, he's headed your way.
Watch where you're going.
Bruce, will you tell me what's happening here, please?
Clear?
Dead.
Are you all right, sir?
Andrew.
What in God's name is going on?
Damn! There! There he is!
Stop! Hold it!
Stop!
Again.
Watch out!
Hold up.
Jesus, that was close.
- You think he would have shot me?
- Of course he would.
Get him to the lab.
What does all this mean?
Top line is Sam's heart rate.
Bottom is the alien's.
They're identical. Brain waves too.
Their nervous systems are linked.
Pulse is 120. Blood pressure
140l90.Temperature 103.
Creature's running him hot.
Move the fluoroscope to the right profile, please.
What's this?
An electromagnetic signal. At first we thought it was just interference.
It seems to be coming from the parasite.
- You were right, then. Radar.
- Yeah.
- Let me hear it.
- It's too high a frequency.
Wake him up. I'm going in there.
Sir, it's not a good idea.
I don't think it's safe in there.
It's Sam, Lawrence.
- Sir?
- It's all right.
Wake him up, Jim.
Bring me that stool.
Can you hear me?
Sam isn't here any more, Andrew.
You know me?
And your dead wife.
And Mary.
You wouldn't believe the fantasies my host has about you, Mary.
- Would you like me to tell you?
- No, we would not.
I will ask the questions, and if you do not cooperate,
I'll administer electric shocks and you will die.
I will stop the heart of this host and it will die.
Get him back!
- He's gone flatline!
- 2cc of ephinephrine!
2cc of ephinephrine, stat.
It's back.
Hold that ephinephrine.
My God, it has total control.
Sam, why have they come here?
What do they want?
I warned you.
Shock it.
I acknowledge you can hurt me, but each shock shortens your son's life.
Do you understand?
Of course I understand.
Now you answer me.
Why are you here?
Our previous hosts ceased to be useful.
You are stronger than they were.
You will last longer.
Right. How many are you?
One.
There may be semantic differences.
Its concept of identity may be different.
No.
No.
How many are you?
One.
Sam, do you have any idea how many of them there are?
It was thinking "one".
It doesn't know why you keep...
Always giving orders, aren't you,
Andrew?
Always telling people how to run their lives.
Maybe that's why you're so Ionely.
Did you ever think of that?
Maybe that's why your son resents you so much.
You won't be Ionely when you're one of us. No-one will be.
For God's sake, tell us what you want.
Peace.
Say goodbye to your son, Andrew.
Jesus. It's killing him.
Get it off him!
It's gone.
Welcome back.
I'm sorry you had to go through that, son.
Those things I said, Dad.
- It wasn't me talking.
- Come on.
Do you remember what happened?
I was aware. I was conscious of what
I was doing and what was happening.
It was like having one of those dreams when you're paralysed.
No matter how much I tried to move or scream, I just couldn't.
It had total control over me.
I was like an open book to them.
They could read everything in my mind. My thoughts, fears, memories.
Did they have thoughts?
I remember something about...
...their ship...
It wasn't a ship, though.
It was like a nerve centre.
A hive.
Had to get back to it...
...to share information with the others.
You know where it is? Do you?
I'm not sure where, really.
Get some rest.
Get some rest.
Let me know as soon as
I can try again.
Say goodbye to your son, Andrew.
That's enough of that. Take it off.
Sir.
The parasites run their hosts at a high body temperature, which gives them an identifiable heat signature.
We have been able to track that heat signature through thermal imaging from satellite sweeps and reconnaissance.
Run the RPV recording.
This is Ambrose, and those red areas are creature-controlled.
Give me maximum magnification here, please.
I want to show you something.
These are human beings with creatures on their back.
- What's the green dot?
- A human being without a creature.
He's surrounded by parasite-controlled hosts.
And now he too has a parasite on his back.
I'm not... I'm not coming.
I'm sorry, Dad.
Get this off me.
Everybody, just get off of me.
It's OK.
- Get it off me!
- It's not on you any more.
It's not on you any more.
OK? You're OK.
- You're OK.
- I can still feel it.
It's gone. It's gone.
You're all right.
Have we been in contact with the governor?
What about the Iowa National Guard?
They will have been infiltrated.
You have to go in on a federal level.
Our nearest troops are the first infantry division at Fort Riley.
- How quickly can we move on this?
- You'll have a force in 12 hours.
I recommend we go in at night to take advantage of the thermal imaging.
Do it.
Wait. I see something.
We're going in.
Go.
Shit.
- Gentlemen.
- What's this?
- This is a thermal image feed.
- It's from Lieutenant Abbey's unit.
They're using children?
You cannot think of them as children.
They are the enemy.
General?
- They're here to see you, sir.
- In the office. I'll be in soon.
This way, men.
We've lost satellite link-up, but we have Lieutenant Abbey on audio.
The situation's under control now.
We'll bring the children into the holding area
then move on to sector seven.
Thank you.
So far so good.
What's going on in here?
Captain Earley, sir.
Iowa National Guard, Camp Dodge.
We're here to provide backup.
I didn't hear anything about you being called in.
- Get me Washington on the line.
- I'd rather you didn't.
Did you find a way to kill them?
No, not yet. We're trying everything.
Different bacteria, viruses, radiation.
But so far we've found nothing that doesn't kill the host.
See the one looking at us? He's wearing the slug we took off you.
They've been sitting like that for hours.
Yeah, they're merging. It's how they communicate with each other.
- Yeah?
- They exchange chemical signatures.
We're ready, Dr Graves.
We should have thought of that.
Ants communicate in the same way.
Where did you get the second parasite?
Just watch.
We set up a keyboard in case they want to talk to us.
Vargas, note the time.
- Does the old man know about this?
- He wanted to make sure.
Here we go again.
This is how they reproduce.
A second adult parasite in minutes.
Vargas, get the old man on the line.
Watch what they do to the little one.
The new one knows me.
I've got General Morgan reporting in.
Andrew Nivens here, general.
How is it going down there?
It was touch and go for a while, but we think the worst is over now.
- It's your son.
- Hang on, Sam.
We've got 70%% % of the area contained
- and kept casualties fairly low.
- Thank you.
Would you take off your shirt and turn your back to the camera?
- Is this a joke?
- No, it's not. Take off your shirt.
I don't take my orders from you.
Order him to take off his shirt. Sam, go on.
I'm sorry, general. Would you humour us for a moment, please?
God.
- There's no signal coming in.
- What's going on?
The transmission isn't lost.
The transmission has been cut because
General Morgan has been taken, and we can assume that his troops are now our enemy.
We're getting reports that the situation's been contained.
The reports are faked.
We're being manipulated.
I have just been told that their numbers are increasing infinitely more than anticipated.
We've lost a town, sir.
Now we've lost an army.
They're capable of transmitting not just intelligence but memory from one body to the next by coming into physical contact.
The new one knew Sam as if it had been the one on his back?
Yes.
How long does it take it to prepare for division?
12 hours. Let's assume we started with 1,000 of them.
We'll be conservative.
That's one day, 4,000.
Two days, 16,000.
- In two weeks there would be...
- More than 250 billion.
You OK?
I don't know why your father picked me.
- I won't be able to find the answer.
- Wait.
He knows what he's doing.
You'll find something.
No, Mary, you will.
Thanks, Sam.
He's given everyone a few hours off to recuperate.
I don't have time to go to the hotel.
I'll go back to the lab.
No, I...
I just live a few blocks from here.
OK.
That wasn't very friendly.
I wouldn't take it personally.
He's kind of a prima donna.
- How about if I make a fire?
- That'd be great.
Is that OK for him to go out like that?
Yeah, yeah. He comes and goes.
- Is this your mom?
- Yeah.
She's pretty.
She died about a year after that picture was taken.
What was it like growing up with him?
- Boot camp.
- I'll bet.
Whenever he was working at home, he'd give me a quarter for every hour I could keep quiet.
One day, I remember it was... it was a Saturday morning.
I decided I wouldn't say anything until he did, even if it took all weekend.
But he never said anything.
I don't think he even noticed.
So how much did you make?
About 12 bucks.
Shit.
It's the old man.
Yeah.
Yeah, she's here with me.
Yeah. OK.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I just dropped the phone.
Look who turned out to be a sweetie after all.
So?
So we have to go back.
Maybe we could stay another... ten minutes.
Don't move.
Why did you do that, Sam?
What's the matter, Sam?
Isn't this what you wanted from the day we met?
You and I together.
You can't hurt her, can you?
But I can.
Mary got it off your cat? Jesus.
They've taken her back to their hive,
I'm positive.
If they've taken her back there, there's nothing we can do about her.
I'm going after her.
No, you're not.
It's a suicide mission.
You don't understand the enemy.
I won't have you on the casualty list.
I have to find the hive, get inside and get information.
In 12 hours that area will be a war zone. You're not thinking rationally.
Dad, I'm sick of thinking rationally.
I'm going after her!
Do you intend to help me or not?
It's receiving OK.
Minneapolis has been invaded.
Civil authorities are fighting to keep the situation under control,
but they are not having much luck.
It's good, but the frequency still isn't matching.
What safeguards can be taken to protect you and your family?
Keep your doors and windows locked.
Don't let anyone into your home, even if they appear to be a friend.
If you absolutely have to venture outside...
OK, can we get started?
Stay tuned to this station for further updates.
There's some sort of a hive that they have to go back to regularly.
Central source.
Intelligence replenishing.
Exactly.
OK, let's run this.
I've had the analysts sort through the thermal image data we've gathered in order to plot the expansion of the alien colony.
This is a satellite picture of Iowa when the UFO was sighted.
Here. Day 1. Now watch.
The orange shape represents the spread of the colony over five days.
Now, what you'd expect, if it's necessary to stay close to the hive, with Iowa's topography, is that the shape would be roughly circular.
So we rationalised it into three overlapping circles.
Could you do that, please?
If we shrink these circles back, we find the location of the hive at different times.
Each time the hive is on the river.
That could be how they moved it.
All right. This is where it all started.
This is where the hive is now.
Des Moines.
Makes sense. High population density.
And it'd be easier to defend.
We've narrowed its location to a ten-block radius in the city centre.
That's where Mary is. I know it.
Show me the projected size of the colony in the next 24 hours.
We'll parachute in tonight.
- We have six hours.
- We'll need eight.
You've got eight hours.
You've got a very tight eight-hour window to pull this off.
- After that you're on your own.
- Yes.
- Opening drill.
- Look, reach, pull.
Good.
Wait up!
I just want to tell you we jerry-rigged these transmitters so they send out the same frequency as the aliens.
It's how they recognise each other.
If you don't get too close, they'll think you're one of them.
- Beautiful.
- Nice.
- Thanks, Graves.
- Thanks.
Hey, Graves, I think you're a genius, man.
I just want to apologise for that comment I made back in the room.
About you fucking the thing.
- Let's go!
- I didn't mean it.
- Thanks. Thanks.
- Good luck.
...choppers. We'll have to use army vehicles and supply them here.
We have to cover this terrain...
Danny?
Somebody help!
Forget it, Alex.
No!
Jesus, I don't wanna end up like that.
- Trapped inside my own body.
- Come on.
He wants to merge.
Remind me to thank Graves.
The president's announcement has sent shock waves throughout the country.
They should be at the city centre now, sir.
... have been filtering in from virtually every state.
In response, the president has declared a state of emergency,
instituting martial law in all major urban centres.
In related news, the financial world...
All units designated primary and secondary to proceed to level P2.
All other units should assemble on the first floor.
- This has to be it.
- Let's go around back.
It's down there.
- I should be going with you.
- Just give me 20 minutes.
How will I know it's really you?
If it's not, you know what to do.
Share information... with the others.
Sam, why are they here?
What do they want?
My thoughts, my fears.
My memories.
You won't be lonely when you're one of us.
No-one will be.
It's everything you try to hide from yourself.
Isn't this what you always wanted?
You wouldn't need the fantasies that life was just about you.
You and I, together.
You can't hurt her, can you?
- It's not on him.
- Get it off me!
But I can.
Get it off me!
Don't move, don't move.
Fuck.
You all right?
There's something you've gotta see.
It's important, Sam.
Wait.
Stay close to me.
This is why they wanted me.
Jesus, Mary, what is this place?
While we've been studying them, they've been studying us.
More dead bodies. Great.
Can we get out of here?
He's alive!
Get him out of there!
This is what we want. Something killed the parasite but not the boy.
Why did it die?
He must have contracted something fatal to his parasite.
He was sealed off in here so he wouldn't infect the others.
This is it.
Come on.
That's Alex. Take the kid.
Alex! I got him! Let's go!
Help!
Come on!
We can't help him. Come on.
Come on.
You gotta get up on the roof. Go.
This'll keep them busy.
Code eight. All units to South Plaza.
Main power supply.
- Can you stand up?
- Yeah.
Do you think you can walk?
They'll pick us up on the roof.
They're coming.
Go!
Come on!
- Take the kid.
- OK. I got him.
You weren't planning on leaving without me, were you, buddy?
Go. Get him to the roof.
Let's talk about it, Alex.
Here, kitty-kitty.
I'll talk to you, Sam.
I know you're in here.
If I have to look for you too long, it's gonna really piss me off.
Where are you, you lousy son of a bitch?
You said you'd help me.
You're no better than your father.
Help me!
God!
Come on!
- Alex, man, fight it!
- Yaaagh!
Fight it, man! Fight it!
How could he, Sam? You couldn't.
Don't leave me!
- Please, Sam, get it off!
- Alex?
- Alex!
- Get it off!
Not very smart, are you, Sam?
Pick him up. Bring him here.
It's safe. Come on!
Where are the others?
You never did have a right hand.
Come here.
We gotta go. Where's Holland?
He didn't make it.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Get Nivens on the radio.
The boy has encephalitis, which causes inflammation of the brain.
It's not fatal to humans if it's treated in a few days, but the aliens are 60%% brain matter, so it should kill them first, allowing us to save the host.
- How long has it been?
- 33 minutes.
There's still the question of disease vectors. How it would spread.
Mosquitoes.
Yes.
Mosquitoes.
We could release infected batches over the areas controlled by aliens.
Wait.
Jesus.
It's disgusting.
33 minutes, 18 seconds.
That's it. We've done it.
Yes, but how do we get to them all?
They've spread so far.
We don't need to.
There's only one alien.
We've been thinking of millions. It's one creature with a million parts.
The same way they transmit information, they'll transmit the disease.
A chain reaction. We can infect the colony as if it were one body.
Perfect.
We've got General Morgan coming in from Fort Riley.
Bring the camera over here, please.
Well, we're all clean, sir.
It seems to be working.
The medics are administering the antitoxin throughout the area.
Most of my men are sick as hell, but the aliens are dying.
O1 to P3. All clear.
Anything?
Yes.
Yeah. They're on their way down?
Good.
All clear down here.
What were they trying to do here?
Rebuild their home.
Careful, sir.
My God!
Everybody OK down there?
Soldier, down here.
You OK?
I'm fine. Sorry. It was silly of me.
I should have been more careful.
Check him out, please.
He's clean.
- Sorry, sir...
- No, please don't apologise.
We'll need to take samples of the structure.
It's a pity we couldn't save it.
What we might have learned...
Well, I've seen enough.
Thank you.
I don't think I would have believed it was really over.
How you doing?
I can't believe
I slept for two days.
Excuse me, sir.
Dr Nivens forgot his cane.
Give me a hand up.
- There you go.
- Thanks very much.
Thank you.
Come on, soldier. On the double.
Move!
Call in emergency services now.
Hello, Sam.
I can fly a helicopter.
Perfectly.
You never told me how good it felt.
I had no idea man could feel such a sense of freedom.
- My God!
- When did you take him?
- Back in the ship.
- We checked.
I explained we had to lower my body temperature, so we did.
- We learn from our mistakes.
- I want you to land this helicopter.
Or what?
A gun.
Automatic pilot.
What are you going to do?
Do you think that you are capable of killing your father?
He'd want me to.
Possibly.
But the question is, can you?
Give me...
But you can't win.
Give it up.
Stand back.
You guys come with me.
Dad?
Come on, man. Don't do this to me.
Don't do this to me! Dad!
Stop shouting, Sam, for God's sake.
You know how much I hate it.
I got it. I got it.
I can't believe you actually shot me.
What would you have done?
I would have shot you, of course, but...
I never dreamed you were that kind of man.
Get outta here, Sam. I'm fine.
- It's OK, I'm going with you.
- No. Take her for a cup of coffee.
Exercise a fantasy.
OK, Dad.
That was the last one.
You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.
- Excuse me.
Have a good time.
I guess you exobiologists finally earned your keep.
Yeah, I guess.
When I was inside that thing, it was like hearing a thousand voices inside my head.
Yeah, I know.
You were there.
Your memories, your thoughts, feelings.
Everything you try to hide from yourself.
Yeah.
I guess you know how I feel about you, then.
Down to the last gory detail.
- Gives you an unfair advantage.
- Why's that?
It would take me forever to learn that much about you.
No, I think actually it helps us.
If you look at it from a sociological point of view, you could argue that men take a lot longer to open up than women do.
So you should be right on track in about 40 or 50 years.
–Hello?
–It's me.
Oh, am I bothering you, Francesco?
No, don't worry, I had to get out of the shower some time.
Hold on a minute, Franco…
You were saying, Franco?
No, no, nothing. Just calling to see how you doing.
You know how things are…
…life goes on.
Gnaghi!
I've been shouting at you for hours. Gnaghi!
He's Ghigini, the surveyor.
12th row, 3rd grave, right?
–Gna.
Grave three.
Here we go.
I know you've heard this before, but this time, my dear Ghigini, it is forever.
Rest in peace!
Oh, my back…
What a waste of good marble.
Never looks right when you fix it.
All this fancy packaging.
I don' know why they don't just cover the graves with dirt.
The gun! I forgot the fucking gun!
–Ea… t!
–Gnaghi, give me the spade! Gnaghi! give me the fucking spade!
There we go.
You handle the rest, Gnaghi.
My name is Francesco Dellamorte.
Weird name, isn't it?
Francis Of Death.
Saint Francis Of Death.
I often thought of having it changed.
Andrea Dellamorte would be nicer, for example.
I'm the watchman of the Buffalora cemetery,
I don't know how the epidemic started,
All I know is that some people, on the 7th night after their death
come back to life.
I call them “Returners”,
but frankly I can't understand why they're so anxious to return.
The only way to get rid of them once and for all,
is to split their heads open.
A spade'll do it, but a
Dum-Dum bullet is best.
Come and have a glass of wine.
Is this the beginning of an invasion?
Does it happen in all cemeteries,
or is Buffalora just an exception?
Who knows? And in the end, who cares?
I'm just doing my job.
Good morning, engineer.
How are you doing today?
Fine, Miss Chiaromondo. And you?
The cemetery is open, isn't it?
For you, any time.
Hello, cutie. Here…
How are you?
He's happy. He likes it when the sun shines.
I'm not an engineer…
…and you are no cutie.
Poor Gnaghi, on his ID card it reads:
“Distinctive physical marks: all”.
He has a real passion for dead leaves,
can't stand it when the wind blows them away…
Oh well,
we all do what we can not to think about life.
The most beautiful living woman I have ever seen!
Will I see her again?
I just came to water the flowers on your poor father's grave.
Husband.
How long has he been dead?
Two weeks.
–Thank goodness.
–What?
–I mean, I'm very sorry.
–Have you no respect for pain?
Well, you know how these things are… You see: in time, pain heals.
–It's not healing a bit.
He was wonderful, he was a wonderful lover, incredible, tireless.
He was fantastic!
I messed it all up,
I've lost her.
Will I see her again?
Hey, Franco!
Franco is the only living person
who even calls me. Now and then I stop by his office
to remind myself what he looks like.
You can't live on memories alone.
It's for you. Sign as usual.
–Have you got a pen?
–No.
Hold on a sec, here we are.
Have you had any visits last nights?
A couple, yes.
All this extra work! It's much if the pay me any more.
Tell the Mayor…
Oh, tell the Mayor then what?
They'd close the cemetery.
Good-bye job and good-bye house!
Come on, who do you think would believe you?
Listen, I don't care if you don't believe me, Franco, you're not the one who pays me!
I believe you,
I believe you, and you're right…
At least have him pay the overtime.
–Good.
Well, let's go to the Mayor, then!
It's not that easy.
First you have to fill out an M3 form, report with an M3 form…
Forms…
I could speed things up there for you…
It's easier just to shoot them.
One M3 form!
Going to get our willies wet tonight?
Some of us, yeah.
Hell, at a certain point in life, you realize
you know more dead people than living.
Sorry about the other day, I was a bit crass. I didn't mean to be.
My name's Francesco Dellamorte.
You know, this is the only job I could get even with a degree in biology.
Anyway we all end up here sooner or later, don't we?
I've got a great little house… Want to see it?
I don't live alone, I've got a helper, Gnaghi.
He's a real conversationist!
The cemetery's small, but it's got a marvellous ossuary!
An ossuary…
I have never seen anything so… exciting!
Neither have I.
It's like in my dreams!
This is my dream.
I couldn't ask for anything more.
Me neither.
You know, you've got a real nice ossuary.
Thanks.
You will allow me to return, won't you?
You will allow me to kiss you just once, won't you?
No.
Not like this.
Like this.
I must be faithful to the memory of my husband!
I can't. I can't!
It's not my fault… It's this place.
I feel strange tremors.
It's not the cold…
I'm not afraid…
This place wants me to…
It's forcing me to…
I don't want to!
I don't want to!
I can't! I can't!
Don't be afraid, it's just ignis fatuus.
Why here?
Why on your poor husband's grave?
I've never kept anything from him…
We trusted each other implicitly.
He would have liked to know.
Well, if that's the case…
All these lights!
Let them watch.
What's better than watching two lovers making love, hey?
Just to have a bit of privacy.
Sorry, but the lady wants stars only.
It's never been like this before, with anybody.
Only you.
No one will ever make us part.
Gnaghi! The gun!
I can explain! Listen to me, you've always been so understanding!
That's life!
It's nothing my love, you're fine.
Great, just when I don't need it anymore.
Well don't just stand there!
Go call doctor Vercesi!
Go on, get the doctor!
Go on! Move!
Nothing can separate us.
I swear, nothing.
Nothing will separate us, will it?
Nothing, my love. Nothing.
Not even death?
Not even death.
Dellamorte, are you in there? Dellamorte!
Jesus! You scared me to death!
Were you looking for me, Chief Straniero?
Yes, Dr Vercesi called.
What happened last night?
Well you know. Why are you asking me? She's dead.
I know she's dead, but how did that happen?
Her husband.
Sure! He came back from the dead, he raped her, then bit her to death.
Is that what he did?
No, he didn't rape her.
Oh, you always crack me up, you know!
Dr Vercesi, are you spying on us?
No, I dropped this certificate.
Her heart stopped from fear, it wasn't the bite that killed her.
She died while making… well you know… doing it.
You know what that means, my boy?
I'll have to look somewhere else for the creep who killed her!
You are no longer a suspect.
–Why not?
Well, you know what I mean.
Look, don't make me say it!
Go on, you can say it. I don't mind, I'm impotent!
Don't use that word! A young man like you, at your age…
Did she have any relatives?
No, no relatives, no friends.
Well, I have to say that…
Shit! This is definitely not my style!
–Can I keep her here?
–If you pay for the funeral, of course you can do whatever the hell you want with her.
–Does that wrap it up, then?
–Yeah, except for a killer on the loose.
Care to join me for a cup of tea?
The weather's changing at last!
I can't forgive myself for having lied to you:
I don't have a degree in biology,
I didn't even finish high school.
I haven't read more than two books in my whole life: one, never finished, and the other is the phone book.
I don't want her to become a Returner.
I don't want to see her again.
No!
Yes, my love!
No, don't make me do it!
But if you do it so well… so well!
Not to you!
It will be better with me than with the others!
Gna!
You do it!
Well go on! If you finish fast I'll buy you an ice-cream.
Gna!
–Here comes the Unforgiven.
–Who?
The Tombstone Mayor.
The man whose dick's so small he pees with tweezers.
He could become a woman. That'd solve it!
They are sewing them back on in the States now.
Yeah, they can stitch it right on, if you've got one to start with.
Forget it, I started that rumour.
The more they laugh, the further away they seem.
You can never be too different, Gnaghi.
Maybe you can.
Engineer!
Engineer, engineer, come!
Have a seat!
Well well well, what a surprise!
Yes! It's a miracle seeing you here, engineer!
It's a miracle seeing you here, Mr Mayor.
So, how are things down at our cemetery? How are things?
Well how do you think things are?
Population's shrinking.
You're lucky, my dear engineer!
You just can't imagine how things are at the Town Hall.
Now that the elections are upon us, it is chaos, right, inspector?
Yeah, it's a thrill for all, nobody wants to lose their job.
I was hoping for a New Deal…
Daddy, what's this?
This is my assistant Gnaghi.
He's sweet!
Will you buy him, daddy?
That's great, it even knows how to cry!
Gnaghi, don't stay so close to her.
Could you move over, darling?
Would you tell your daughter to move over please?
Yes of course.
Sometimes Gnaghi gets a little bit excited…
Oh, I'm sure he's charming.
Now, where was I?
What's he doing? Dancing?
No, no, he's just about to…
What the hell are you doing, Valentina?
He threw up on me, Claudio!
Oh, a new fan!
Would you like to go for a ride?
I knew you'd understand!
Take off!
By the way, one of these days
I have to talk to you about the cemetery.
The youth of today…
They're so… emotional.
Come on, Gnaghi!
Get in, for God's sake!
Don't do this, just get in the car!
It's not the end of the world,
It didn't even bother her!
She understood it was just a demonstration of your affection.
Anyway, it's not the first time you threw up over a woman, is it?
Come on, Gnaghi, get in!
Look, first love doesn't count.
It's last love that counts!
Nobody came today.
I was a bit bored, not even the admiral… he's just disappeared!
Let's hope tomorrow, okay?
Yeah, come again and stay a while.
Oh, he was such a distinguished man, the admiral!
Always used to bring me, always, a touch of Sambuca.
Oh, come on, Gnaghi!
You'll get over, you'll see!
Time passes, nothing seems the same…
It just gets worse.
God, is it ever difficult trying to make you feel better!
What were you doing with the Mayor's daughter anyway? She's only a child!
Gna!
Oh yeah, that's not true, you are not a child, Gnaghi.
You're a year older than I am. Anyway…
One day, you'll settle down with some… poor creature like yourself.
In the meanwhile, why do you care?
They all end up here sooner or later, Gnaghi.
Often sooner than later.
Faster, open it up!
–If daddy could see us now!
–He'd kill me!
Claudio!
–Off we go!
–Go!
Go! Go!
Go!
–Hang on!
–Eat our dust!
Four motorcycles racing…
The Mayor's daughter is on one of them.
Her head was sliced right off.
They had to sew it back on the body.
The bikes crashed into a bus loaded with scouts on their way back from a church-sponsored rally.
Slaughter of the innocents!
And they were all so young.
They felt their life was ahead of them, but in fact they were already passing by.
Well, you've got your hands full!
Oh, more than you know!
Gnaghi, we're going to need a lot of bullets.
♫ Never should have gone out on the Boy Scout picnic,
♫ never should have, never should have gone just then.
♫ Never should have gone out on the Boy Scout picnic,
♫ Never should have, now
I'll never go again! ♫
Claudio! Take me with you!
Don't leave me all alone, Claudio!
Take me with you, my love!
Oh no, sweetheart!
My son wasn't with you!
He was promised to the Mayor's daughter!
–But he loved me!
–Liar!
He was mine, he loved me!
Only me!
–Have you no respect for a mother's pain?
We're born to die, born merely to die.
Do you remember?
Just yesterday, she was alive, happy.
Do you remember?
Dear Gnaghi even threw up on her, and she took it so well!
And now, she's gone… and right on the eve of the elections!
I better get the pickaxe and shovel.
Pumpkin, how could you do this to me?
Is it true as they say, that the dead come back to life here at night?
Tell me the truth!
Hey! Who told you that?
Is it true or not? Is it true or not?
What if it is?
I've got to see Claudio again!
I have to know whether he loved me or her!
If I hear anything, I'll let you know.
No, wait…
Go away! I haven't got time for the living!
Gnaghi?
Gnaghi!
Gnaghi, they came back sooner than we thought!
Gnaghi wake up!
Gnaghi, watch out!
Gnaghi,
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.
Well, that's it, time's up and
I want you upstairs and ready in five minutes! Okay?
Oh no, what's she doing here?
Visiting hours are over!
No one is going to take me away from him!
Quick, get the fuck over here! Quick!
No… Claudio!
Claudio, take me with you! Don't leave me!
Stupid cow!
Come on!
Wait! Wait!
Claudio please, take me with you!
Tell me you only love me!
Please…
Claudio!
You only love me, right?
Damn! It always shoots to the right when it's cold.
Gnaghi!
No, please don't!
He's only eating me!
Move aside.
Mind your business! I shall be eaten by whoever I please!
This is my business.
They pay me for it.
The living dead
and the dying living are all the same.
Cut from the same cloth.
But disposing of dead people is a public service,
whereas you're in all sorts of trouble
if you kill someone while they're still alive.
Wait!
This way they'll be together forever.
I'm sentimental.
Patience, Gnaghi.
In love, it's the waiting that's the best part.
You have to learn how to wait.
–What's your name again?
–Gna!
Gnaghi.
I'm Valentina.
Haven't I seen you before?
Oh yeah. Now I remember.
You threw up on me. How sweet!
But I like shy boys, and you never say no to a kiss.
Take advantage.
I'm certainly in no position to refuse. Besides,
I don't think I'd refuse anyway.
False alarm!
It was only a cat.
No use you trying to help me, little thing!
If I can't do it, imagine you…
Putting this skull together, is one of the most difficult things in the world.
Gna!
You know, you really are disgusting when you eat, Gnaghi.
Yes, you're right. I suppose it all does get mixed up in the stomach, in the end.
What is it?
That wasn't a cat!
We can't! I'm alive, and you are dead.
I'm not prejudiced, my love.
I killed her!
Gna!
I killed her!
I killed her.
The first time, when her husband bit her, she wasn't really dead.
When she woke up, and I shot her, she was alive.
I killed her.
I killed the only woman I ever loved.
I shot her with my eyes closed,
didn't aim for the head.
That's why she came back.
God, what an idiot!
Now, I'm infected too.
Will I be a Returner when I die?
Who knows if Gnaghi…
No, poor Gnaghi, he'd never have the guts
to crush my skull with a shovel.
I'm not dead, you idiot!
A bite can't kill you!
Good morning, engineer!
Miss Chiaromondo,
I'm not an engineer.
Are you, or are you not the watchman of the cemetery?
Well, of course I am.
You are therefore an engineer.
By the way, which of these do you think would be better on my tombstone?
Both.
I like the opinion of a handsome young man.
Good-bye, engineer.
–Gna!
–Good morning, cutie.
But that's the phone book.
Are you crazy?
That is my favourite reading!
Gnaghi, just because we've got the new ones doesn't mean to say we have to throw the old ones away. These books are classics!
Gnaghi!
Gna!
Stop killing the dead.
They're mine.
If you don't want the dead coming back to life…
why don't you just kill the living,
shoot them in the head?
Are you listening to me?
–Hello?
–Greetings from the Tomb of the Town Hall.
–Franco! How are you?
–Bored.
Am I disturbing you?
No, you never disturb me.
Just called to talk about the scandal.
–Gnaghi, the door!
–…all that crap.
What did you say?
What the hell was that?
Nothing, I'm…
…just working.
–What?
You know, daily grind.
Nothing but the daily grind.
You're telling me! Sometimes,
I feel like shooting myself.
How's everything in your life?
How are dear Mara and Cinzia?
You know, sometimes I wonder if they really exist, Franco.
I mean, you do have a wife and a daughter, don't you?
I only ask 'cause… sometimes
I think you've made it all up.
Franco, you do make me laugh!
You'll get out one day.
Buffalora will be nothing but a bad, bad memory.
Yeah, or maybe not, if only I could get unstuck…
I feel like a fly on fly paper.
You'll see, Franco…
Mara is going to get tired of you, and Cinzia will grow up to hate you.
Then you'll be free.
Free to see what the rest of the world looks like.
What do you think the rest of the world looks like?
–The rest of the world?
–Uh-uh.
Who knows if the rest of the world even exists…
Look who it is!
Hey, Dellamorte, come here!
At times, I get ahead of my work.
Work!
Dellamorte!
Dellamorte!
Gnaghi!
Francesco Dellamorte?
Where were you between
11 and 12:30 last night?
In bed.
Any witnesses?
I was talking to my friend Franco on the telephone and I fell asleep.
Why, what happened?
Some fucking maniac killed 7 people in town.
More work.
Well, you got to go to jail, unless you have an alibi!
Why me?
Because your car was seen driving around the streets last night, that's why.
That's impossible, no one can drive that wreck apart from me.
Actually, I don't think it was you.
I think it was your assistant.
Gnaghi can't even roller-skate!
Neither can I, so what?
I want to question him immediately.
God, the weather's gone bad.
Please, let me talk to him first.
Just tell him to come right out, will you?
Don't you ever clean that place? Jesus Christ, it stinks!
♫ When all is sad, when you're alone, it feels so bad.
♫ You wait again for love to start, to feel the beating of the heart. ♫
Gnaghi!
Gnaghi, I had a terrible dream last night,
I dreamt I went to town and killed 7 real people.
Hi, remember me?
Dellamorte, you've got important visitors!
You'll understand, engineer, after this massacre, the voters are furious with me.
They've been voting for you for 15 years.
If I don't find this maniac, Straniero, there won't be a sixteenth.
What's your daughter got to do with it?
Now that the whole town is in mourning,
I want to show them that I'm grieving as well.
I'll have some pictures taken of the body and put a blow-up on my election posters.
And underneath, something like:
“if you've had a death in the family, vote for someone who suffers like you.”
What do you think?
Well, you know, it's a thought!
Or: “Vote for a man who has lost all other happiness.”
Ready to shoot?
So what do I do? Take one from the neck down?
Engineer?
What's the meaning of this?
Daddy!
Daddykin!
Did you hear that?
I don't know. It depends…
Daddypie!
Daddypooh!
Valentina!
Pumpkin!
The plot thickens!
Pumpkin, where are you?
Where are you?
Your Daddy's here!
Where are you?
Stop blabbering and come on in!
Coming.
Here I am, little one.
Jesus, it stinks in here!
It's my fault, daddy!
Oh my God, Valentina!
What are you doing on TV?
I'm rotting fast, Daddy!
You, stuttering monster, you're the one who hurt my little girl!
No, he loves me!
Step aside!
I command you, as your Mayor!
With your consent, I'd like to marry Gnaghi.
–This horrible thing?
–Gna!
I'm not such a great catch either, Daddy.
Not as long, dear, as I've got a breath in my body!
Alright. We'll fix that right away!
Help me, engineer!
I'm not an engineer!
I'm sorry, Gnaghi, she really was beginning to… go off a bit on that, wasn't she?
He's dead?
He's dead.
Who took a bite out of his neck?
Well, not me or Gnaghi,
Take a mould of our teeth.
You'll see they won't match.
And who did it?
Oh, relax, Straniero. This won't be your first unsolved case, will it?
Hold it!
Oh, come on, Gnaghi…
The world's full of girls like that, and they've got bodies, too.
By the way, do you know what my mother's maiden name was?
You'd never believe it if I told you.
She was called Dellamore.
Dellamore.
That means “love”…
You're not the only person in the world who's lost a lover, Gnaghi.
Get down!
What do you think?
Get down from there!
Forget it, engineer!
Go home!
You're supposed to be setting a good example, now will you get back to your coffin immediately!
You can't stop me, you owe your job to me.
Remember?
–Get down or I'll shoot.
You can't.
I'm the Mayor!
Ex!
–Mr Dellamorte?
–What?
I'm Civardi, the new Mayor.
Why the barbed wire?
Do they climb in at night?
No, they climb out, sometimes.
Would you mind coming down?
You reported an epidemic which affects the dead.
You claim they come to life within seven days of burial.
It says so, right here.
–An M3 report.
–Didn't you fill it out?
–No.
Oh, splendid.
So you'll provide us with a denial.
Just sign here.
Franco must have sent it.
What a nice thought.
Nothing happened.
Nothing ever happens.
If the press got hold of something like this, not only would Buffalora be a laughing stock, but you'd lose your job.
My personal secretary.
Mr Dellamorte.
–A pleasure.
A real pleasure, Mr Dellamorte.
Thank you.
You and I are going to get along just fine.
Good-bye.
Your name!
I didn't get your name…
Will I see her again?
Hi!
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you, Miss.
I was expecting someone else.
Miss! Miss!
Ever since I got to Buffalora, strange things have been happening to me.
It's as if I've been here before.
And that grave…
And you, Mr Dellamorte, it's as if
I've known you forever.
As if I've loved you forever!
You love me, too?
Why?
Who else is there?
I love you as well.
I love you.
I've heard what they say about you in town.
Is it true that you don't…
I mean, that you can't…
No, you don't wanna believe town gossip.
Because I can only love an impotent man.
Yeah, it's true. It's true.
I like men… but their manhood terrifies me.
I can't stand the thought of them having a…
I mean… you understand?
It's a sort of phobia I have.
I don't have one, I don't have anything at all.
Will you marry me?
I'm getting married!
Gna!
I'm really getting married!
Don't pretend you didn't hear everything.
Gna!
Yeah? Why not?
Go ahead, explain…
God gracious…
What are you saying?
You heard me!
My dear boy, you must be very run down.
I'm going to give you some pills.
Dr Vercesi, I'm serious.
Look, I'm not going to be intimidated in my own surgery.
That waiting room there is full of people with good, honest diseases.
I'll pay you…
Yes I know, but…
How can I? I mean, everybody knows that… you haven't got one.
I see. You have got one.
When would you like me to relieve you of your… problem?
–Now.
What are you waiting for? Get on with it!
Now what?
I told you I don't want an anaesthetic.
It's not an anaesthetic.
What is it, then?
One shot of this, it'll be as if you've never had one.
It lasts for over a month.
Look… please don't make me cut it away.
Today I'm just not up to it.
What are you doing, turning over?
I have to give you the shot in the front.
Front where?
Hold still, I'll just make a puncture.
That fucking butcher… has given me some kind of infection.
Gnaghi!
I'm hovering between life and death.
Gna!
Yeah, you're right.
I suppose I'm used to this condition.
That's her. Don't let her in. Tell her I'm not here.
I don't want her to see me like this.
–I must see Mr Dellamorte.
–Gna!
Please, I've got to speak to him, is he in there?
I'd give my life to be dead.
Gnaghi!
It doesn't hurt anymore.
I think I'm better.
Gna!
When did t happen?
She was our nicest client.
The best always die first.
Gna!
Where have you been?
I thought I'd go mad.
If you only knew what happened to me.
If you only knew what happened to me…
I must talk to you.
We'll always be together.
Yes, my love, yes.
I don't know how to say this, but the Mayor raped me.
–No!
Wait! I liked it.
Not the violence, no.
But after that, we did it again nicely, so that I'd forgive him.
It was wonderful, do you understand?
That means I'm cured. I don't have a phobia anymore.
I can't marry you, now.
I'm going to marry him.
That doesn't mean anything though, I mean, nothing's changed between us, I still love you.
You know that.
I just love you in a different way, but you're important to me.
He knows, I mean, about you and me.
He's a wonderful man, he said he's happy we can be friends.
We can still see each other.
Nothing's changed.
Everything's just as it was.
Everything.
You look for Death in the clear night,
you tell her you still love her,
that you are her slave,
that she's still your queen.
Death, Death,
Death, the whore.
No, I'd only do it for the fear
and I'd come back
just to experience the same fear again.
To be afraid,
always to be afraid.
Hi!
Is that white VW outside yours?
We're on foot.
Could you give us a lift?
It's not very far.
Go on!
I'm Magda.
And this is Laura.
How far is it?
This is where we live, with another girlfriend.
Do you want to come up for a drink?
Come on, you're not afraid of two college girls, are you?
Make a wish. I grant wishes.
I want you to fall in love with me.
But I'm already in love with you.
Haven't you noticed?
It's cold in here.
If you'd like to wash, there's a sink there.
I didn't mean your face, silly!
I don't know whether I can do it.
I've been taking some medication…
I don't think your medication is working!
Do you love me?
Yes, if you stay all night.
All my life, too.
–Come on!
–Let's rest a bit.
–Why?
–You've come three times already.
Twice. The third one was faked.
She's sleeping, she's been studying all day. she's got an exam tomorrow morning.
I just wanted to get some wine.
Sit down.
I'll get you some.
Did Laura tell you you can pay me?
Pay you?
School's expensive, my friend.
I have to pay you?
We don't have a scholarship, you know.
Besides, it's only 100,000 lira.
She told me she loved me…
That's 150,000.
She wants me to stay the night.
Is a cheque all right?
It's money, isn't it?
Hurry, darling.
I'm cold.
Come and warm me up.
I need your warmth.
Warm me up.
Coming, love.
Now you'll be warm forever.
This time I'm really through with love.
I bet you'd like to know where I was between 1 and 3 last night, wouldn't you?
I know, I know.
Here we are. Have no fear,
I won't tell anybody about this cheque, this is the reason I came here.
We're both worldly men, aren't we?
–But this could be proof against—
–Proof against whom?
We've already arrested the guilty party.
After setting fire to the apartment, he went home, killed his wife and daughter, then turned himself in. He's at the hospital, the psychiatric ward.
Somebody's stolen my crimes!
Sir?
Excuse me, this section is closed to the public.
I've come to see the killer.
But you can't go in there. He's in a coma.
He drank a whole bottle of iodine.
I have to take his measurements.
Franco!
You looked a lot better the last time we talked on the phone.
Thief!
You're a thief…
You may have killed your wife and daughter, OK, I'll give you that, but it was me who knocked off the three girls.
What are you doing stealing my murders?
What kind of fucking friend do you think you are?
Especially as you thought you were doing me a favour.
Put that out immediately!
Smoking is not allowed in here!
–Shut up!
He's in a coma.
He doesn't even notice.
Shit…
What'd you say?
Everything's shit…
The only thing that's not shitty… is sleep.
What are you doing on the floor, sister?
She's praying.
Friend of yours?
Look, he hasn't got any relatives and the coma he's in is irreversible.
Give me a signature and I'll pull the plug now.
–Fuck off!
Here we go. Put it back in there.
I won't let you die until you give me an explanation.
Why did you steal my murders?
Don't you think anything
I do counts? Huh?
Oh, my God! What happened?
They killed each other. It was a settling of scores.
Don't you believe me?
–No!
–Tough.
So bad…
So, is that all you have any need to say to your only friend?
Who are you?…
I don't know you…
I don't know who you are.
Go away.
Go away!
Dellamorte, wait.
For God's sake, wait! There's another maniac on the loose.
He's on the 4th floor killing people.
He already shot three.
You got a gun!
That's good.
Now you can defend yourself.
Hey, take my advice and get the hell out of here quick!
Straniero!
It was me!
You and I are both the same.
We kill out of indifference, out of love sometimes, but never out of hate.
Now I don't know who's dead or alive.
I'm sick of killing.
So I'm leaving the game, brother.
Dellamorte Dellamore… bids you farewell… and is on his way.
Where to?
Better get out of here.
Even the statue's talking.
Where do you think you're going?
if you haven't yet understood the difference
between life and me?
Gnaghi, you're not bringing that!
That coffin is not coming with us!
Yeah, I missed that one. Don't worry, I'll get the next one.
Oh, calm down. I know every bump on this road.
There's one!
Look!
I'd never been this far.
We made it, Gnaghi!
Who could have imagined this?
Wider than all the streets of Buffalora put together.
–It never seems to end!
–Gna!
Hang on, Gnaghi.
Past this tunnel is the rest of the world.
What do you think the rest of the world looks like, Gnaghi?
Can you imagine it?
You're right. It's beyond imagination.
I should have known it.
The rest of the world doesn't exist.
Gnaghi!
Gnaghi, you weren't hit that hard. Come on.
Come on, I'll take you to the car. Come on,
Come on! Why are you going on like this? You've just got cut.
Come on man, get up,
I'll take you to the car!
Come on! Come on, get up!
What? What?
Gnaghi!
Gnaghi!
Don't leave me alone now. Gnaghi! Gnaghi!
Oh God!
Death,
death, death comes sweeping down,
filthy death the leering clown,
death on wings, death by surprise,
veiling evil from worldly eyes,
death that's born
as life succumbs, while death and love
two kindred drums, beat the time
till Judgement Day,
an actor
in a Passion Play,
without beginning, without end,
evermore.
Amen.
You were my best friend.
I didn't even realise it.
Could you take me home?
Please.
Gna.
Oh, Jesus.
Rise and shine.
So you're up early.
Unbelievable.
This guy outside just broke the window of that car to steal an umbrella.
- Looks like it's gonna rain today.
- I swear, Keyes, this neighborhood scares me.
It really does.
You love it.
Hardly.
I'm gonna be late tonight.
Afew of us are having drinks with the new creative director.
You should come.
He's suppose to be terrific, and who knows, he might wanna look at some of your stuff.
- What, shooting cans of Spam or Reeboks artfully lit against a backdrop of the Grand Canyon?
Been there, done that.
Thanks.
You son of a bitch!
Get outta here!
- Well, at least we're not the only ones up at this hour.
Come on.
- Suki, you're making a big mistake, baby.
I see you opening your door and letting me back in now.
Please let me back in.
- You're the one that lives here.
Have fun.
Yeah.
Suki, let me back in.
You don't understand.
I'm a man, I'm not responsible for how the women feel about me.
Go to hell.
- Look, you're making a big mistake.
Now let me in the door!
Now!
Oh, come on.
Pal, get a clue.
Who the hell are you?
- Today, maybe I'll be her big brother.
- She thinks she's so goddamn special.
Well, let me tell you something, girlfriend!
You won't be beautiful forever!
Kick a guy like me out?
Next one might not be as nice!
See you around, Suki!
Thanks, Keyes.
Primped up, asshole!
Met him at the Start
House last week.
Two dates and he's already got someone else on the side.
- Suki, maybe you were on the side.
Hey, Ground Zero?
Yeah.
Just let me...
Yeah. All right.
No, you gonna make sure that-
Excuse me.
- Could we get through, please?
Watch out.
Thank you.
- Nice bike.
- Thanks.
Oh, I don't know.
He doesn't know.
' Okay.
Hold the door.
Oh, God.
And I was feeling pretty good about getting out of bed this morning.
- Morning.
- Hi.
' Morning.
- Dick, if you got some time this morning, we need to talk.
- Yeah, sure, what, the toilet's break up again?
No, no, nothing like that.
Yeah, let me clean up.
Hey, hon, I'm no Superman.
- That's not what you said last night.
Ba dum bum.
Ooh.
Superman.
- Keyes, I feel like death.
So?
What's so different about that?
Morning!
Fine rain.
Washed scum off the street.
Thank you, Travis Bickle.
Are you talking to me?
So, you actually met him.
Briefly.
Well, I'm jealous, Suki.
I mean you always keep your men so, so secret.
And then, suddenly, poof and they're gone.
- Ah, the start of another beautiful day.
What is it, Keyes?
What's wrong with me?
Why do I end up with such losers?
Suki...
It's not your fault, you know?
People change.
In six days they change?
Come on, Suk, don't do this.
Not for this guy.
He's dangerously coifed.
So...
What's up?
He's all yours.
- Well, we were thinking of maybe having a show.
An opening, really, like the downtown lofts.
No, no way.
It's in your lease.
This is not a gallery.
It's a studio space.
Just let me finish.
It would be like a big party.
We'd include Pauli from downstairs and-
Mm, I don't have insurance,
I don't have the permits, don't have security.
- Yeah, and you won't have any tenants.
At least not us anymore.
And, Suk, when's last time you made any money.
- Come on now, I bought a painting from her, last year.
Yeah, exactly.
- See, Dick, it's not just for us.
I mean, you've been trying to rent the last studio in your building for a couple of months now.
A show might be just thing to attract another tenant.
- Oh, clever, that's very clever.
Not clever at all.
This is a blatant manipulation.
Look, Dick, we need this show.
We need to get our stuff out there.
Absolutely not.
Oh, God.
Come on, Dick, don't be one.
Where are you going?
- I'm gonna go get ready for the show.
' Keyes.
Hey, Keyes!
- Looking to buy or just browsing?
No, no.
I...
Actually, I took a picture of you in there.
And I think it's gonna be pretty good.
Actually, I might be able to sell it.
I'm very happy for you.
Yeah, well...
I don't think I should be the only one to profit.
Well, thanks.
Son!
Gotcha.
Like it?
Yeah.
It's interesting.
- Been in my family for generations.
I want you to have it.
No, I...
No, I can't.
You're an artist, aren't you?
Surely, you can appreciate the craftsmanship.
Do me a honor.
Take it.
Please.
Look below the surface.
Look how beautifully the image is preserved.
You've got my vote.
I think a show would be fun.
Open the whole place up.
Besides, I already checked, there's nothing else going on the week of the 24th.
- Wait a minute, that's next week.
Mm-hm.
- You're obviously talking about work already done, yes?
- As long as your promise a sculpture that doesn't rust, Pauli.
- Ooh.
- Or leak.
- Perhaps you'd like something in whited linoleum.
- Ha ha, no, it's just that your sculpture-
Huh?
- To me, it's just kind of scary.
I mean, that's just how I feel.
- That's not necessarily bad, scaring people with your work.
- Yeah, at least it's a reaction.
- I think the only real emotion left in this world is fear.
You're right.
She is.
Llanie, we're in here.
- Hi, I have to pee really bad, I'll be right back.
So, Keyes, tell us, huh?
What really scares you?
Rent.
Rent, Dick.
And Republicans, they scare me too.
The old Keyes cover up, huh?
Yeah, don't ask him anything that digs too deep, you know?
He'll just cover it up with a joke.
Come on, Keyes.
You can tell us.
We're all family here.
- Now there's a scary idea, the American family.
And why we spend so much time preserving a delusionary institution that screws up so many people,
I'll never know.
Hear ye, hear ye.
I'll drink to that ship.
I know what scares me.
When I was a child, there were creatures that lived in my room.
The Boogeyman?
No.
He was under the bed.
These demons were different.
They would wake me up at night and dance for me.
Dance for you?
- Sometimes, I swear I could just reach out and touch them.
- Honey, where did you get this?
- Some bum gave it to me on the street.
You can toss it.
No.
You can toss it.
Scoot over.
Oh, my God.
Look at this.
I love it.
I do!
It's fantastic.
Can I borrow it?
Would you mind?
I'll give it back.
- Actually, Suki, you can borrow it if you promise not to give it back.
Thank you.
So, what do you think?
About what?
About the show.
All right.
All right, you've got a show.
- So, this new creative director is just like everyone said.
He's an older guy, but, I don't know, he's really in tense.
What you thinking about?
How beautiful you are.
- What are you really thinking about?
What Dick said tonight.
You think I hide things?
Walls around me?
Well, I think we all do, but I've gotten through yours, haven't I?
Suki.
Where are you, my little pickle?
Goddamn paint slapping bitch.
Throwing me out?
Me?
Man, that's ugly.
Oops, sorry.
No more fucking with me.
What the hell?
Wow.
What the?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Let's go upstairs.
So, where is this woman, Suni?
Suki, sir.
She's upstairs.
She's pretty upset.
She's with a police officer right now.
I take it she knew this guy?
Ray? Oh, yeah.
I mean, Ray and she were kinda-
How long?
A week.
Well, six clays actually, sir.
Well-
- Was Ray in the habit of breaking in?
Well, no.
Let me show you something.
They just split up, you know?
It's right over here, sir.
- Apparently Raymond drank up quite a bit.
Broke in and decided to settle things his own way.
Who knows, maybe he would've cut her up as well.
But I guess he must've panicked, lost his footing and went through the window.
What do you think spooked him?
He was pretty drunk.
Could've been anything, a noise, a shadow.
Maybe he just got a look at himself.
Whatever it was, he will take it to his grave with him. ls someone here?
No, no.
It's just me.
This is a first.
People?
You don't take pictures of people.
- Oh, maybe I've been missing something all this time.
- Wait, is this
Keyes Terry talking, whose last show consisted of 36 assorted angles on Rancho Seco nuclear power plant?
So, I'm entering a new period.
Time to give people a try.
- Does that mean you're gonna give me a try?
I mean, what's going on with us?
What are we doing?
I think we're doing just fine.
Every couple of weeks, you get a little nervous and we have the same little talk.
Don't patronize me.
It isn't like that.
I wanna move on.
I wanna move to the next level.
And I wanna do it with you.
God, I never met someone so afraid of commitment.
Look Llanie, I love you.
I think you do.
I just don't know what you're so afraid of.
All right!
Here we go!
Yeah!
Very good.
Tell me about your father.
- I don't really know him.
I know what you mean.
No, I really don't.
I never met him.
- And you never told me that before.
- Yeah, well, I'm not exactly proud of it.
He knocked up my mom, she was like 16, then he disappeared.
- God, Keyes, I can't believe you never told me that before.
I feel like a such an idiot, talking to you about the next level.
I hardly even know you.
Smile.
Oh.
Hi.
The...
Are you okay?
Fine.
Whoa.
New work?
Wanna see?
Oh, wow.
Oh, this is great.
The demons.
Like you said last night, your demons.
Watch them dance.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, this is fantastic.
You know, what, it's amazing, how you work.
It just flows out of you, and just flows.
On a good day.
Today is an especially good day.
Are you scared, Dick?
Take my hand.
Dance with me.
Let's dance with the demons.
Shadows.
They're all just shadows.
It's all we can ever capture, you know?
Light is deceiving.
We see what we want to see.
Do you understand?
- You know, Suki, I know this gonna sound funny, but I've always been kind of intimidated by you.
Scared even...
It's just that you're so beautiful.
But I guess you knew that, didn't you?
Look.
What do you see?
Close your eyes.
Now, what do you see?
Darkness.
But there's an outline.
It's you.
- You needn't be afraid anymore.
What the?
Oh, Shit.
Coming.
Coming, coming.
Hi.
Detective Clark.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I tried to call earlier, but nobody answered.
Come on in.
This is just formality.
I have your statement about last night.
I wonder if you'd sign it for us?
Take your time, look it over, sign at the bottom.
Now, this other fellow,
Keyes Terry, I have his statement here.
Is he home?
Keyes?!
Keyes, you home?!
Yeah!
You okay?
Oh, hi.
- Mr. Terry, I have your statement from last night.
Mind if you look it over and sign it for us?
Yeah, sure.
You okay?
Absolutely.
I have one other statement.
Cutler, Dick Cutler?
Should I just leave it with you or?
Dick?
Dick, why don't you come out here and take care of this?
Dick.
Keyes?
Dick?
Hello?
Yeah, this is Keyes Terry.
Yeah, I...
Yes, can you tell...
Who was that?
That Detective Clark.
He wants me to identify a body.
What are you talking about?
Whose'?
- He said wouldn't need me if they knew that.
It's bizarre.
Suki.
Sum'?
Sum'?
What could've happened?
I don't know.
She was acting crazy today.
Something about work.
No ID, no nothing, except for this little note that we found in his pocket.
It has your name and address written on it.
You know this man?
No.
I don't, I mean, I saw him once across the cafe, but no, I don't know.
- That's just excess air escaping from the lungs.
You get used to it.
What?
He reminds me of someone.
Keyes, honey, what is it?
Nothing.
The body, how you gonna bury it?
- One piece at the time, I imagine.
Well, assuming that a family member doesn't claim them, these guys usually wind up as cadavers at med school.
Probably his greatest contribution to society.
- I'd like to pay for a proper burial.
Wait, now, wait, wait.
You're gonna have to help me here.
Now, do you know this man or not?
No.
But I'd like to make sure he got properly buried.
Can you arrange that?
Like I said, I'll pay for it.
Yeah.
Yeah, we can take care of that.
Yeah.
Keyes?
What happened tonight, at the morgue?
I don't know.
Yes, you do.
Tell me.
It's just...
Seeing that guy laying there, he was all alone, made me think of my father.
I don't know.
You don't think that-
Mm.
Then why?
Who knows?
I don't know, maybe my father's laying on the streets some place right now.
Like to think somebody would take care of him.
Somebody might return the favor.
- Do you ever wonder what he was like?
I bet he was like you.
I bet I would've liked him very much.
Suki?
Suki, where are you?
Are you here?
I haven't been able to think about anything else all clay.
Oh, God!
Suki!
Damn it!
Suki.
- So, Mr. Cutler, you were the last one to see her alive, and when was this?
This afternoon, sir.
This afternoon.
Well, she was working hard, painting, you know, like there's no tomorrow, so, well,
I think she was feeling kinda lonely, so I just did what I could, you know, to keep her company.
- I want you all to take it really easy tonight, okay?
Yeah.
Keyes?
What you looking at?
Me, I guess.
I can't believe how much has happened.
Gonna miss her.
So am I.
Will you come to bed, please?
Yeah.
- Well, you get what you pay for.
I'm still trying to figure out why you did this.
He in there?
Oh, yeah, you just missed it.
Touching scene.
You guys work fast.
Franklin I. Bronner, his name, how?
- Basic, I called up his prints, his history was there.
Figured it was only fair since he had yours.
- You mean, he had a police record.
Yeah, you might say that.
Yeah.
What for?
You sure you wanna know?
You haven't paid the bill for all this shit.
I'd hate to have you rethink your offer.
You're kidding me, right?
- This happened 26 years ago, upstate New York.
Place called Amityville.
Your friend here blew away his whole family, dad, mom, brother, and sister.
- This is why you wanted to meet me, to tell me this?
I thought you oughta know.
I also wanted to know more about why you think he tried to get in touch with you.
Actually, it was a pretty famous case.
At the trial, there were a lot of angry people waiting outside the courthouse pushing for a death penalty.
But he copped an insanity plea.
Claimed he was possessed by the devil.
You okay?
Yeah.
This picture looks...
Looks familiar.
Can I keep this?
Mm.
So, then what happened to him?
- They sent him to Danamore.
- Where?
- Danamore State Hospital.
Cookie jar up north.
They released him seven years ago when Reagan cut the budget from mental institutions.
Guys like Bronner slipped right through their fingers.
Cured.
So, I guess he just saw your name somewhere, huh?
Maybe a photograph in the magazine or something?
I wish.
- Though we'll never know why he came after you.
" What?!
What the fuck, who did this, Clark?!
Who did this?!
I never said anything about that!
Hey.
Keyes, relax, huh?
What?!
- Somebody just screwed up the paperwork somewhere up the line.
I mean, it's not like people are waiting in line to help bury the homeless these days, you know what I mean?
Somebody just made a wrong assumption.
Take it easy, okay?
Yeah. Right.
Sure.
Bronner, Franklin I.
Admitted: December 11th, 1966.
Prognosis: paranoid, delusional, sociopath.
Claimed to be communing with unknown evil power.
Let's see.
Say you're a student?
Yeah, at Community Central.
Yes.
Well, that's fine by me.
As you can see, there's nothing to do around here anyway until they close last wing down.
There used to be a lot of Bronner types.
So, like a genetic sort of thing by my estimation.
Really?
- These paranoid delusory murderer types, by all accounts, one day, they're just fine and then, ping, something clicks into place and they're off to the races.
It's like the neighbor who said,
"He was such a quiet type."
You seem like the quiet type.
Look at me.
I can't seem to shut up.
Well, we don't get a lot of visitors here.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
- Actually, I was wondering if I could see his room, if that's possible.
- You fellas always wanna go to the room, like there was some spirit there.
It's all in the file.
Suit yourself.
Cell 207, south wing.
It's shut down, so watch your step.
You knew Ms Mr. Brenner'?
Actually no, I...
I met him once.
He gave me a gift.
Ah.
I see.
Bet that was a mirror.
How did you know that?
How did you know it was a mirror?
Ooh, I read minds.
I'm clairvoyant.
It's in the file, everything is in the file.
- What does it say in the file about the mirror?
You know, the one advantage of murdering your entire family?
You're sure to inherit everything.
After Brenner got out or here, he could've had a whole house in Amityville.
Full of furniture.
According to this, all he wanted was one mirror.
Everything else was up for auction.
Why do you suppose that was?
I don't know.
Watch your step.
Come on, honey.
Keyes, we gotta go.
- Oh, God, how many years in this place?
Oh, no.
Surprise, surprise.
Guess who's got a visitor?
Who the hell are you, guys?
Oh, not this game again.
Hey, don't make me mess you up!
Hey!
This is a mistake!
And you made it, Brenner.
I'm not Brenner.
He's my father.
- Dr.
Finney, Treatment Room 1.
Dr. Finney, Treatment Room 1.
Mom?
Franklin.
Franklin, this is your wife.
Don't you remember her?
She's come a long way to see you.
Frank.
Help me.
I'm not crazy.
- Why don't you let us decide that?
Keyes, come over here.
Don't be scared, honey.
Hello, son.
Mommy!
Get up! Let's go!
Oh, my God.
- We could've met in my office.
Whose in that grave, Clark?
Tell me.
- No, you tell me.
Went to Danamore today.
Goddammit, that's my father in there, and you knew it!
Why didn't you tell me?!
I wasn't sure.
- You had to know
I'd go down there.
Didn't you have any idea what it would that do to me to find out who he was and what he had done?!
You already knew, Keyes.
You knew.
Those memories were buried inside you.
They had to come out.
You have to deal with them.
Who the hell are you?
I work with the special detail that focuses on psychopathology.
- Oh, so, what, like mass murderers and serial killers?
Yeah, that sort of thing.
Yeah.
It's a growth industry.
If we'd been around the time your father's crime was committed, that would've been our concern.
As it is, I'm making it mine now.
- What, so you've been watching over me since this thing started?
You and your special detail deciding whether or not
I can learn about my father, about myself.
What, is this your job screwing with people's lives?!
- Keyes, by the time I figured out who the hell Bronner was,
I realized you had to know.
I checked the records.
You were there, you saw it all.
Now, maybe you blocked it, because children who witness this kind of stuff either block or they become obsessive, even thinking they may do this sort of thing themselves one day.
Now, you've lived free of pain for the last few years, Keyes.
But you've been on borrowed time.
Now, this bill has come due.
I wanna help you.
I'll make some coffee.
- He was only 17 when he committed the murders.
He'd been in and out of mental institutions throughout his childhood.
Even still, he never showed any tendency toward violence at all.
Did he know she was pregnant?
- I think the first he heard he had a son was the day your mother took you to visit him at the mental hospital.
- So, after he got out, he came here.
Why?
It's like he tracked you down.
- Maybe he wanted you to remember.
That's pretty frightening.
- What did he say to you that day?
Nothing.
Yeah, he gave me that mirror over there and he said it was in his family for years.
- Oh, that kind of make sense in a strange sort of way.
- So, that mirror came from the house.
Apparently.
I wanna get it out of here.
- I'll take care of it in the morning.
Storm's coming.
It'll pass.
- Where's this all going?
It doesn't matter.
I'm with you.
You're up early.
Sweetie, those are your photographs.
Why are you destroying them?
- Working on an idea for the opening.
I need to lay it out first.
Really?
American Gothic 2.
That's what I'm gonna call it.
Kind of a send up to the whole Grant Wood,
Norman Rockwell deal.
Norman Rockwell.
Funny, never thought of that.
- So, you're gonna blow these up?
Huge!
Life-size.
Then I'm gonna be a build a set around it, kinda like a huge
Thanksgiving scene.
- I don't get it, not that I have to.
- A huge happy
Thanksgiving scene.
You know, mom, dad, a couple of kids, a turkey.
Kind of stuff you grew up with.
A turkey?
Yep.
A turkey.
- It's just gonna have this rotting mold sorta shit growing around the bottom, you know, signifying the inevitable degeneration of the American family.
But, I don't know, it's too heavy... ls everything okay, sweetie?
- Yeah, I'm just very excited about this.
And so am I.
What the hell is this doing here?
I thought you said you were gonna get rid of it.
Oh.
I'll try to work it in.
Okey.
Bye.
Bye.
Oh, my God.
Keyes, honey, you in there?
' Come in!
Why not?
Hey.
You okay?
I saw your, uh, in the other room, your thing.
Is it done?
Where have you been?
Work.
Where do you think?
You've been working all day, sweetie?
Watch.
Okay, look.
What?
There.
Oh, my God.
They're all this way.
The emulsion ran.
I've seen it before, but-
No, no, not like this.
Look, they're all dead.
- Well, it looks kind of like an ink blot.
Doesn't it?
I guess everybody sees something different.
Yeah.
What do you see?
- Maybe it's time for you to take a break.
- I can't, I need this for the show.
Come on.
We'll figure something else out.
Come on.
Yeah.
Keyes.
What is it?
Listen.
It's only a dream.
Where are you going?
- Been having these nightmares for a week now, ever since I met him.
They're his dreams, it's the only explanation.
That's not possible.
You know that.
Don't you?
Yeah.
But they're so real.
- It's like Clark said, you repressed the memory, and I guess it's just trying to get out.
- I don't have a memory of what happened in Amityville.
I wasn't born yet!
Maybe it is mine.
- What?
- Maybe I'm gonna commit the same crime.
Maybe it's my destiny.
Just like Bronner, maybe it's in the blood.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Remember what else Clark said.
He said that it was easy to become obsessed with that thought.
You're in control of your own life.
Think I've lost it.
Then take it back!
We'll take back control, together.
What Bronner did was a terrible thing, but that doesn't mean you're gonna relive his insanity.
You're not gonna kill anyone.
How do you know that?
- I know you're stuck in it right now, but you have to get to the other side.
' HOW?
You can do it.
What?
Kill us.
Kill us all.
I think you need an ending for your show.
This is it.
This is what?
Come on.
Look, here's my thinking.
When something terrifies you, the best thing to do is confront it, head on.
I mean, that's practically what you do for a living.
You're an artist.
You're suppose to be scared and confused.
So, go after what scares you.
Go after Brenner.
You think this is funny.
No, I'm serious!
You've got this ridiculous idea that you're destined to shoot your family.
Well, Dick, Jane, Pauli, we're your family.
Shoot us.
We can even put red food coloring in it.
It'll look like blood.
- Sorry, I just don't see the connection.
- All right, maybe it's a stupid idea.
Keyes, I can only help you to a certain point.
Tonight's your chance.
You designed this crazy show for a reason.
See it through.
Hey!
Keyes!
Man, you look like shit.
Come on in, come on in.
You wanna take a look?
Huh?
- Sure.
- So, come on.
Give me a hand. Come on.
Gently, gently, gently, gently.
The gun's on a timer.
Set to go off sometime before the year 2001.
I call this
When and Where.
It's like life.
Right?
The TV setup.
I mean, everyone's used to watching violence on TV, right?
I'm giving them an option.
Hey, you all right, hombre?
I don't know.
So much death around here, Pauli.
Ah.
I don't intend to die.
Actually, no one does until it really happens, though, huh?
It's not loaded.
Right?
Oh, that's good.
Here we go.
Oh, yeah, here we go.
Hi, thanks for coming.
Show's right in there.
Here you go.
What?
She was really distraught.
Her lover died recently.
- I heard she committed a suicide.
Her work really shows it.
- You're a very brave man, Pauli.
A loaded gun, with all these critics around.
- One of you care to sit here while I go and use the can?
Keyes.
Hon, you okay?
So, when are we gonna do this?
I don't know.
It's going great, though.
Jane was right.
Scott from the Times is here.
And I think grant people showed up.
So, about 10 minutes.
I'll tell everyone 10 minutes.
Okay.
- You've reach
Inspector Clark's office.
If this is an emergency, please dial 911, otherwise leave a message him.
Clark, this is Keyes.
I need your help.
- Bobby, it's nice to see you.
Ah, dammit.
It's okay, we're taking care of it.
Candles.
Jane.
Maybe you could find the candles.
Good idea, Dick.
Shoot, where's the flashlight?
I'll be right back.
Watch out for the matches, will you?
- If I get through this evening, no more artists.
Jesus Christ.
Dick.
Hello?
Oh, my God.
Sum'?
Dick, help me.
I'm so alone.
You promised me.
You said forever.
Is that really you?
You said forever.
Dick, I wanna take you with me.
No, you keep away from me!
Hold me.
Touch me.
No!
Oh, oh!
There we go!
Hey!
Is Keyes ready?
Yes.
Let's do it.
Gentlemen.
Okay, right this way.
It's called American Gothic 2.
It's a performance piece.
It's compelling, probing, and mercifully short.
Excuse me.
Get the hell out of that chair.
- Come on, man, it's probably not loaded anyway.
- You're in here, aren't you, Bronner?
Watching me.
Waiting?
Know what you want,
I'm not gonna do it!
I'm not you!
I'm not.
Go to hell, Bronner!
I refuse!
Son.
Oh, no, Suk.
Okay, no, if I can get alone.
Well, that's the easy part, 100%.
Then, what do I want, an ingestible?
What do I want-
- Dick.
Is that you?
I should've gone to Parsons!
I should have!
But people like you said
I had a head for business!
But I don't have now, do I?
Do I, Keyes?!
Huh?!
Where you going?!
Come back here!
Are you a landlord?
Brenner. uaughs)
I'm proud of you, son.
Now, it's up to you.
What is?
Amityville.
It's in your blood.
This is gonna be good.
Where the hell is Dick?
Maybe we should just go on.
I told you he'd weasel out.
Ladies, this ain't what we rehearsed.
Keyes.
Look at me.
Jesus!
Keyes.
Keyes!
No!
Freeze!
Keyes, stop.
Look at me.
- Hold your fire, hold your fire.
Son.
Son, you can do it.
Come on.
Everybody down!
" No!
It's in your blood.
Son.
Come on!
Leave me alone!
Everyone lost their mind?
Keyes.
Hey.
Big mistake, Keyes.
Seven years bad luck.
My God.
There's an awning on the new store.
There's still soap on all the windows.
So?
They're hiding something.
I don't think so, Nettie.
I think it's just going to be some kind of antique store is all.
I'm never going over there.
Hey, Raider. How are you, buddy?
Good to see you.
–Hi, Nettie.
–Hi.
–Is Polly around?
–Gosh, yes. It's lunchtime.
Hi.
–Morning, Frank, Father Meehan.
–Hi, Alan.
Good afternoon.
–Smoked turkey on rye?
–Not today.
Think I'll try one of your specials today.
So I'll have… What's that? I'll have that.
Delicious salami… provolone, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and two kinds of mustard in a pita pocket.
I wouldn't.
Okay, how about smoked turkey on rye?
Good order.
–Smoked turkey, rye!
–And a big piece of Nettie's apple pie.
So how's your day so far?
A little crazy, actually.
Did I tell you I got the photos back…
“You won't believe your eyes.
”Needful things.
”A new kind of store.
You won't believe your eyes.”
It says so right there.
Then it must be true.
So, who's the new owner?
Nobody knows.
Not from around here is all.
Aren't you supposed to be in school?
Got a cold.
Hello?
–Is anyone here?
–I'm here.
The door was unlocked. I didn't bust in.
Of course it's unlocked. I'm open.
You've been here before.
–No.
–Sure you have.
I never forget a face.
Who are you?
My name is Leland Gaunt. And you are?
Brian Rusk.
Nice meeting you, sir.
I'm equally pleased to make your acquaintance, Master Brian.
Now, what would you fancy?
–Fancy?
–What would you like?
Everything that's here is for sale, but not everything that's for sale is here.
I have a basement, you see.
Are you from overseas somewhere?
I'm from Akron.
–Where's that? England?
–That's in Ohio.
What do you know?
There's Wilma Jerzyk and her husband Pete.
What do you suppose they're up to?
Buying feed for their turkey farm?
Roast turkey?
No, she's a crazy person.
Now, what'll it be? A Walkman!
–A mountain bike.
–I already got one.
–Air Jordans.
–I don't know.
–Sure, yeah, I guess.
–Of course not.
Those are just objects, aren't they?
Just things. Nothing really important.
Suppose you had one wish, Brian.
What would you say?
–A wish?
–One wish. Just one. To make you happy.
What would make you happy again?
Let's see, where do we start?
–What could I possibly have around here…
–Mickey Mantle?
–Little before your time, wasn't he?
–Yeah. I meant the baseball card.
I mean, me and my dad, we used to collect them.
Topps or Fleers?
Topps. We had a whole collection of 56 baseball cards.
Al Kaline, Whitey Ford, Roy Campanella, guys of that caliber?
We have every Yankee except Mickey Mantle.
I mean, Moose Skowron was over $65.
Skowron is one thing.
Mickey Mantle.
That's got to run $600, $700.
You asked me.
I believe I might have something that'll make you very happy, Brian.
Stay right here.
My God. Look at my butt.
–I look awful.
–No, you look fabulous.
Pol, you know how… you're always saying that I'm not all that serious about us?
This is your camera, right?
I don't look like this.
–I'll commit suicide if I look like this.
–Polly, I…
Will you marry me?
Sure, whenever you're serious about it.
I gotta check Nettie.
Make sure she doesn't burn the French fries again and put me in the poor house.
Polly…
I am serious.
Mickey Mantle!
“Topps, 1956.”
Signed, “To my good friend Brian.”
Wait a minute. Brian is my name.
That's impossible.
“Best wishes, Mickey Mantle.”
Now, close your eyes, Brian.
Close your eyes.
Now, then. How much would you pay for this card, Brian?
Mickey Mantle. Topps, 1956.
Signed, “To my good friend Brian.”
No, listen, all I got here…
The buyer must never tell the seller how much he has.
If you can't tell a lie, then be still.
The first rule of fair trade, Master Brian.
–So what do you think?
–I can't breathe yet.
It's not as great as it looks.
I got it off the TV.
Such a liar.
–Put it on?
–Yeah.
Does that mean yes?
–Yeah. Yeah?
–Yes.
No.
95 cents!
Now we're getting somewhere.
Not quite enough, okay?
But an intriguing offer nonetheless.
Let's call it… half the price, shall we?
Yes. Half the price is 95 cents.
The price you paid cash.
The rest… the other half is a deed.
You understand?
–A deed?
–A trick. More like a tiny prank.
No big deal.
And no one's ever going to suspect you.
I promise.
Do you remember that lady we peeked at buying feed across the street?
Yeah, Wilma Jerzyk. The turkey farmer.
You know where she lives?
Out of the car.
I said, “Get out of the car.”
Now.
Is this your name on this goddamn ticket,
Ridgewick, or is it a forgery?
–You're parked in the crip space.
–The what?
–You can't come in here…
–The what?
The handicapped space.
We've told you about it before, Buster…
What did you call me?
Did you call me Buster?
Touch me again, I'll throw you in the cell!
I mean it!
It's Danforth! Danforth Keeton ll… who is Head Selectman of this piss pot little town.
I could get you fired off the force in two…
Make that one second flat.
–Am I getting through to you, Norris?
–I told him to write the ticket.
In that case, my mistake.
Jesus, Dan, what in hell's got into you today?
Nothing got into me! I'm just sick and tired of self-important little pricks.
–Pusillanimous assholes…
–That's enough!
I try to do a lot for this town.
I accomplish a lot for this town.
In fact, I am this town. And I am sick and tired of this goddamn persecution.
–I am not persecuting you, Danforth.
–He called me Buster!
–You know how I feel about that.
–Then he'll apologize.
Won't you, Norris?
–Don't know that I will.
–You will.
Now.
I'm sorry.
–I'm sorry that I called you Buster.
–Yeah, you mama's boy. You candy-assed…
Shut up, you bloated, cigar-sucking used car salesman.
Boats, shithead!
I sell quality preowned yachts, you miserable fucking scuzz bucket…
Shut up! Shut up!
When I moved here, I thought,
“Great, I'm out of the big city.”
I'm in a place where people won't be crawling up each other's asshole every day.
Where maybe my biggest nightmare was gonna be getting a cat out of a tree.
But forget that!
Everybody is insane everywhere!
So you guys just fight it out between you.
One of you kill each other, and who's ever left, I'll throw in jail.
You can do it. I know you can.
He's not gonna bite.
But what will I say?
You introduce yourself. “Hi. I'm Nettie.”
Then what?
Nettie, just go. You'll be fine.
Go on.
Hi. I'm Nettie.
Thank you.
It's only 19th century. I'm sorry.
Enjoy your purchases.
What's this? Some old wood chisel?
It belonged to a cabinet maker at Château de Versailles… in the days of Louis XVI.
Look at this, Pete. Looks pretty old.
Yep.
My God. I didn't think we had room for another soul in here.
Hi. My name is Nettie.
That stupid dog barks at me once more…
I won't bother complaining to Sheriff Pangborn again.
–I'll come over your place, skin him alive.
–No, not in here. Dear God, please!
–Throw her Baptist ass in the street.
–I will not.
Dear ladies, let's all be friends.
Can't we all be friends?
Not in this life.
Please, not in my place.
I'm sorry. Ladies, excuse me!
Miss Jerzyk!
Pick it up. Go ahead. Go on.
Don't be afraid, Miss Cobb.
No. I had one just like it years ago.
But it got broke.
–My husband…
–Your husband?
Then it's Mrs Cobb.
Although my George has been passed on for some time now.
–He died, untimely.
–I'm so sorry to hear that.
No need to be sorry.
It's been seven years since he was…
Murder is awful.
–I didn't mean to.
–Of course not.
It wasn't you who took that meat fork from the drawer… and stuck it in his throat.
Are you leaving, Mrs Roberts?
I'll have to think about it.
It is a lot of money.
You think about it. So will I.
You baked this?
Of course.
Homemade every day from apples picked down at the Mayflowers'.
Polly Chalmers, my boss, sent it over.
Go ahead. Take him.
–I'm scared I'll drop it again.
–You won't drop it.
Come, Mrs Cobb.
Please, sit down.
Listen.
Sometimes I think I can hear the tiniest laugh.
I like you, Netitia.
I won't yell at you, like George did.
You moron!
No!
I think it should be yours, Netitia.
I need to go to work.
I'll see you soon. I'll drop by for a bite.
Mr Keeton eats there most every day, does he not?
Yeah. Danforth Keeton.
And everybody calls him Buster behind his back.
Why is that? Pray tell.
I don't know.
Maybe someone should play a trick on Buster.
Teach him to be nice.
My husband played a lot of tricks on me.
Maybe it would be fun to play one on someone else.
Nobody would ever know it was you,
I promise.
Welcome to Needful Things.
Alan Pangborn.
–The sheriff around these parts.
–Leland Gaunt. Owner.
–So, what can I sell you, Sheriff?
–Me?
Nothing. I got everything I need, thanks.
Fair enough.
How about a piece of pie?
Your fiancée Ms Chalmers sent it over.
–My fiancée?
–Such a pretty lady.
You're a lucky man, Sheriff. I'll be back.
Goodness.
I wish I had some cheddar cheese.
But beggars can't be choosers, can they?
Certain we haven't met somewhere before, have we?
What, you and me?
In a big city.
You look familiar, Al.
You look out of place here, actually.
You don't mind my saying so, so do you, Leland.
So, where are you from?
Ohio.
Akron, to be precise.
Pittsburgh.
I'm from Pittsburgh.
So, why did you leave?
I was a cop there, and I got tired of all the shit going down.
And one day I just lost it.
I hit this guy.
Way too hard.
I reckon he needed some killing.
But it was still wrong.
Of course it was.
Yeah. So I left, and now I'm here.
So am I.
–Reverend.
–Sheriff.
–Alan, thanks for coming!
–Afternoon, Father.
–Hi, Sheriff.
–I got this in the mail this morning.
“Listen up, you mackerel snapper.”
–Excuse me.
–“We've tried to reason with you…
”…but it's been no use.
We have put up with your Popish idolatry…
”…and even with your licentious worship of the Babylon whore…
…but now you've gone too far.”
“Babylon whore.”
I mean, saints preserve us.
“Heed our warning.
Give up your plan to turn this town…
”…into a den of thieves and gamblers, or you will smell the brimstone.
” ‘The wicked shall be turned into hell.’ Psalms 9:17.
The concerned Baptist men of Castle Rock.”
It's that idiot, Reverend Willie Rose.
Maybe you shouldn't have called it “Casino Night.”
For God's sake, Alan.
It's only a little charity gambling.
I mean, I don't know why it upsets the Baptists so.
I'll go talk to Rever…
When I was younger, people got along better!
I'll go talk to him.
I'll get to the bottom of it.
You do that, Alan.
And when you do, you tell Rose that if he tries to bump us… he'll find out just how hard we “mackerel snappers” can bump back!
Pete, get me a gobbler from the pen!
I feel like turkey tonight.
You feel like turkey every night, Wilma.
Wilma!
–What happened?
–Mud!
Mud and shit! Goddamn turkey shit!
Why'd someone go and do that?
–Because I told her I'll kill it.
–Told who?
Dot.
–Yes, just a sec. It's for you.
–Me?
Okay, it's the square key. All the doors.
Don't forget the lights.
You can do it. You'll be fine.
–I'll see you in the morning.
–Night.
Hi. This is Nettie.
I know what you done, you crazy bitch!
Done what?
Fucking with me was the worst mistake you ever made.
I'm going to get you for this, you understand? You and your mutt!
You don't dare!
You stop bothering me and my Raider!
–He's a good doggie!
–You won't see me coming!
Guy sounds like he's havin' a fucking pepoleptic fit.
Yep.
Don't kick the Rock-Ola, Hugh.
You hear me?
How you doing at the tracks, Dan?
Horses finally running your way?
Every time, Henry. Every goddamn time.
I'm gonna kick that jukebox wide open, you don't fix it, Henry.
All right. That's it. You're out of here.
Give me that back.
Any of you fellas heading up to Castle Hill? Hugh needs a lift.
Pink slip is what Hugh needs.
For a city employee making an ass of himself in a public tavern.
Yep.
Nice to have friends.
You know, Henry? They do it at night.
They come in, and they take out the mirrors… and they put in a piece of one-way glass and stick a camera on the other side of it.
Then they watch you, and they laugh at you.
And they take down every single word you say.
Yeah.
–You're drenched to your soul.
–They threw me out!
–I'm sorry.
–Here.
Let me help you peel this thing off, before you catch your death.
You got a nice jacket in the window.
A classic early-'50s beauty.
Warm as toast. Dry as a bone.
It's just like the one I used to have in high school, before I was a bum.
When I was a kid.
I'll bet there are quite a few people in this shit pit of a town… who wouldn't believe you ever were a kid.
I know. It's not fair. I try so hard.
Not hard enough. So they crushed you.
They buried that wonderful boy deep inside you.
–Which boy?
–This one.
We'll find him again, Hugh.
We'll resurrect him together.
Because, all of a sudden, it's 1955 all over again.
It was the best hour of the best day of my life.
–God, I loved that jacket.
–Which jacket? This one.
This jacket, Hugh.
You could recover, retrace your steps.
Take charge of your life again.
God, this is still so beautiful.
Say, Hugh, do you happen to know… a nice little Baptist lady called Nettie Cobb?
Sure. Crazy old wretch killed her husband.
How much do you want for it?
–Mr Gaunt?
–I am he.
Reverend Rose, sir, of the First Baptist Church of Castle Rock.
May I take this opportunity to welcome you to Castle Rock… on the good Lord's behalf?
–Why not?
–Excellent.
It's my unusual urgency when I ask, what faith, sir, are you?
–What faith?
–Religion.
–You're not Catholic, are you?
–You might say that I am… nondenominational.
–I knew it!
Then you will have little objection to my placing this in your front window.
I couldn't possibly do that.
You see, I, like you, am here to serve everyone.
However, by way of compensation… perhaps I may offer you something, which might interest you.
Say, how about an objet d'art?
What is your preference, Reverend?
Asian, Roman?
That is 2nd century, Reverend.
Wasn't it St Augustine who said,
“Make me chaste, O Lord.
But not yet, not yet”?
Father.
Reverend.
“Paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things”
Yes. I'm so thrilled.
Thank you, Mr Gaunt.
Treasure Island. First edition, actually.
Signed by Robert Louis Stevenson himself.
–It's magnificent.
–Take a gander.
If it's too hot in here, Mr Jewett, just say the word.
I'm afraid I have a tendency to turn up the heat.
Hello, Ms Chalmers.
–My goodness. What's wrong?
–Where did you…
How long have you been there?
I was just hoping for a cup of coffee.
I didn't realize you were closing.
Coffee? Sure, no problem.
–You're Mr Gaunt.
–And you're Polly Chalmers.
I'm sorry, I don't shake hands. I have…
Arthritis. Forgive me. I forgot.
You've been having a devil of a time with it lately, haven't you?
Yes. How did you know?
Nettie told me.
Here.
Just a tiny thank-you note for that remarkable pie.
My Lord.
I don't think I ever had a tastier cup of coffee.
You wouldn't, by any chance, have something in the way of a doughnut?
Something I might dunk, Ms Chalmers?
Please, we're going to be neighbors.
Why don't you call me Polly?
Go on.
Oh, no! No! No! Shit!
–Dan, it's me.
–Jesus! What the hell are you doing?
You scared the hell out of me, sneaking up on me like that.
–Put the gun down, Dan.
–Yeah.
Another couple of seconds, I would've been out of here. You would've missed me.
–What can I do for you?
–I had a call from the state auditors.
Yeah?
We have an Appropriations Committee meeting next week to discuss budgets.
–Guess what. It's on my calendar.
–They wanna be there.
They want me to bring them printouts, shit from city hall.
Yeah, you know those bastards.
They're on some kind of fishing expedition.
What the hell's going on?
I've been having some bad luck at the track lately.
So I borrowed some money from the town petty cash fund to cover the shortfall.
Jesus, Dan.
I'm gonna pay it back.
I was gonna pay it back before next week.
–Honest to God.
–How much we talking about here?
–$20,000? Jesus Christ!
I'm getting a loan on my dealership to pay it back, from Boston.
When?
Any day now.
Two days, four days, next week.
Four days?
Done.
You stall them for me, all right?
–Yeah. I will. Till Monday.
–Okay, thanks a lot…
–Believe me, I'll make it worth your while.
–Like hell, you will. Just pay it back.
I just meant if you wanted a deal on a new boat. It's all I meant, I swear.
Whatever you want. And for Polly, too.
–I'll get her a deal on…
–Monday!
How's my boy?
You have something that's mine, Brian, that you haven't finished paying for.
–But you said I could have it if…
–The dealing isn't done, you see… until Mr Gaunt says the dealing is done.
And away they go!
She's A Hell-Raiser breaks on top and goes straight to the lead…
 followed by Confucius Sings and Mr Lee.
Lots Of Luck having a go wide, turning.
She's A Hell-Raiser…
Yeah! Boy, what the hell?
–That was pretty fine.
–Fine as paint.
–Can I…
–Careful. See, this is no ordinary toy.
–What is it?
–You see, the man who sold this to me… his father made their fortune from it.
Every morning he'd take the day's racing form… and run its races before they ever happened… one by one, right on this board.
He'd give each tin horse the real name from the paper… do it just by touching and whispering.
–A brand-new name.
–Citation.
Sea Biscuit, Well Away…
–Seattle Slew.
–Man O' War.
Whoever were running that day.
Wind her up, let her go.
Run the whole damn slate that way!
Northern Dancer.
Eight, ten, a dozen races.
Then go right to the track, and bet on those fillies… that won on this astonishing toy from Japan Incorporated.
He'd rake in the cash, Dan.
Rake in the goddamn cash.
Rake in the cash.
How much?
Good day to you.
–Good morning, Father.
–Father.
–What do you want?
–Coffee and the usual.
Hey, Corn Cobb.
–What's the button on your boob?
–You're crazy.
–You leave me alone!
–Take it easy, Nettie.
Put the knife down.
Put it down.
Okay, Wilma. What'll it be?
Raider on rye, a little glass of puppy pus, and two nice doggie eyes.
–Why don't you just order up or get out?
–Wilma.
–Shit.
–It's okay.
I'll go talk to her.
April Dreaming, Junction Salute.
She's A Hell-Raiser.
Tammy's Wonder, Easy Sweep.
That's My Boy.
Yes, okay, little puppies.
You ready now? Let's run a good race.
–Ready, set, go!
–And away they go!
And it's Tammy's Wonder. April Dreaming.
Junction Salute on the outside.
And Easy Sweep is far back.
–Into the far turn.
–Neck and neck!
–Tammy's Wonder on the inside…
–Tammy's Wonder!
Tammy's Wonder's gonna go on to win.
Tammy's Wonder from April Dreaming.
We've got Love My Martinis, Trentier…
Doubter's Ridge, Rancadoo…
By George, and Confucius Sings.
Little Chinese puppy.
Okay, fellas, now, let's go.
Make money for daddy!
And they're off!
–It's the white one, the red one.
–Danforth?
It's the green one. God, they're beautiful.
Look at those beautiful horses!
Run, run, run! Come on!
Come on. Come on, horsies.
Who's gonna win here?
–Danforth?
–Goddamn it! Go away!
I'll be out when I'm out.
–Aren't you going to work?
–I am at work!
Would you like me to go down to the bakery… and maybe get some honey-dipped doughnuts?
Yeah. Honey-dipped doughnuts.
Yeah, toilet paper, a nose job.
Just leave me alone!
You ready now? Let's run a good race.
Ready, set, go! They're off!
And they're coming around the corner.
It's a runaway victory!
Yeah! Come on, come on!
Yeah!
Good boy. Sit.
Stay. Mommy's got to go scoot and do something for Mr Gaunt… before it gets dark.
But don't you worry.
Mommy's going to lock all our doors from now on.
Stay.
Lovely day.
Come on, girls.
The crowd is tense.
Brian Rusk doing the pitching.
And let me tell you, he is really sensational. He's working on the no-hitter.
We're in the bottom of the ninth inning.
A count of 2 and 2 on the batter.
Two men on base, but Brian has walked them both.
Right now, he's checking the runners leading off first and second.
He's gotten the sign from the catcher, the runners lead away…
 and here's the pitch.
Strike three! How about that?
Will he make that no-hitter, or will he not?
Brian Rusk. Man alive!
Is he really sharp today.
Sensational control of his 90 mile-an-hour fast ball.
Still the chance of the no-hitter, and he's ready to work.
Rusk has got a swift curve ball that's dipping and darting.
And his fast ball, they can't touch it.
Brian Rusk is delivering a performance…
that can take the Yankees to another World Series.
How about that?
Brian Rusk is ready, and he delivers.
And the pitch…
Jesus Christ.
Good girls.
Yessiree.
We're having fun now.
Raider!
Little pal!
Raider. How they hanging?
Good fella. Yeah. Ain't you?
And ain't you got a face just cute as a baby bug?
Yes, you do.
And you know what I got?
I got a beautiful jacket.
Yes, I do.
And you know what else?
I'm gonna keep it.
They're rounding the bend, and yellow, and white, and pink…
“Punky Boy.” Yeah.
“Gasco Thunder, Hooded Lady,
Mr P, Lotsa Luck, and Rosie D…
”…Punky Boy, Raise The Dead,
Frank's The Name, Gimme Shelter…
…Sudden Fame.”
God! I'll kill him! I'll fucking kill him!
Ridgewick!
Raider?
Mommy's home.
Raid?
What the fuck?
That bitch!
You killed my doggie, you bitch!
You broke my microwave, you crazy fuck!
Wilma?
See the windows?
They're busted!
Wilma? You all right?
Come on, bitch.
Come for me, if you're coming.
Wilma.
There's nothing quite so invigorating as a crisp fall day in New England.
–Don't you agree?
–Mr Gaunt…
Leland.
I'm sorry. I can't even think.
Believe me, Polly, I know you're in pain, so I shall dispense with the small talk.
I'll give you the item I called you about and send you home.
–Give it to me?
–More or less.
But let's leave that until later, shall we?
When it rains, it pours.
They're after me.
Go upstairs, Mr Keeton, to my apartment.
Make yourself a nice cup of tea.
–I'll be with you in a minute.
–I don't have a minute.
Go upstairs.
It was funny.
They were actually feeling much better.
Then just a few minutes before you called, they started swelling up like…
I know a great deal about the past.
Now, this is very, very old.
Egyptian.
–Not as old as the pyramids, but still…
–Do you have a glass of water?
–I need to take my pills.
–Not any longer.
You see, this is called an Azca.
It is a tool of Bencalitis. White magic.
–They say it wards off pain.
–Yes. Please, my pills.
–Really, I'm not superstitious.
–Doesn't matter, Polly. This is.
I'm sorry. Must be the storm.
What storm?
I assure you, there is one coming.
Put it inside your sweater.
Wear it right next to your skin, Polly.
My hands.
I can't even unbutton my sweater.
You must never take it off, Polly.
Not ever.
A heinous double-murder, or a bizarre act of revenge gone awry?
Sheriff Alan Pangborn is unable to comment.
No, don't tell me.
They've been in your house.
–They sent Norris Ridgewick.
–Yes. Yeah, how did you know?
They're so predictable.
I need your advice.
I think I should kill Norris Ridgewick.
No. That would make things far too easy for them, Dan.
They'd come get you, hunt you down like an animal.
Cop killer. No. They'd have a party.
They'd get all liquored up at Sheriff Pangborn's office.
They'd go out to Homeland Cemetery and urinate on your grave.
Shit.
I hate this place.
–I hate these people.
–But they're all part of it, Dan.
You know that.
All your weasely fellow selectmen, all your so-called friends.
But Sheriff Pangborn, he's the big-shot ringleader.
He came in from the outside, Dan, to take over your town.
And, boy, would he love it if you blew away one of his little drones.
–So what should I do?
–Nothing.
I'll keep this gun for a while.
Save you from yourself.
You just go to the races tonight, Dan, and win yourself a bundle.
Sow confusion and uncertainty amidst the enemy, yes?
Yeah.
Confusion and uncertainty.
That's my boy.
In the meantime…
I'm laying my own plans.
And when the great moment comes… for everything you do, Danforth… this one is for you.
O mighty and eternal God… hear our prayers for your daughter Wilma… whom you have taken from this life to yourself.
Grant her light, happiness, and peace.
Let her pass in safety through the gates of death… and dwell with all your saints in the blessed light…
“The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
”He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
”He leadeth me beside the still waters.
”He restoreth my soul.
”He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness…
”…for his namesake.
Yea, though I walk through the valley…”
Step aside, please.
–I need to talk to the sheriff.
–Now, son, sheriff's got his hands full.
You didn't happen to see this happen, did you?
No.
You have any idea who threw these apples?
–No.
–Then maybe you better go on home.
Watch it, kid.
Easy.
Easy, Brian.
Why'd they do it,
I mean, if you had to guess?
You're asking the wrong guy.
I don't understand anyone anymore.
You want the knife or the cleaver?
I can't believe somebody didn't hear or see something.
–Morning, Norris.
–Nice of you to drop by, Deputy Ridgewick.
Went by Nettie's again this morning.
Found this in the alley behind her house.
Yeah. I bet Wilma could've done the job on the dog… with that knife, all right.
Congratulations, Deputy. Nice work.
Run it for prints.
–I'll bet you 10-to-1 they're not Wilma's.
–Why not?
I mean, it figures, if Nettie threw the apples, Wilma must've killed the dog.
'Cause Nettie didn't throw those apples.
Would you go to someone to kill him… and spend a half hour breaking their windows first?
If Nettie didn't throw those apples, who did?
Maybe the same person who killed the damn dog.
–Where you going?
–I'm gonna pay Brian Rusk a visit.
I want you to canvass the neighborhood.
Somebody must've seen something.
I'm not shitting you. The most disgusting murder I've seen in my six years.
Even worse than the lady with the meat grinder.
–I don't want to hear.
–Hello, sheriff's department.
–I'm sorry, Father. He's not here right now.
–Is this for me?
I'll tell him. Thank you.
I have no idea what that is, Norris.
It looks like a present, Norris.
Why don't you go and open it?
Shit! Goddamn it! Get it off!
–Get it off!
–Hold still, Norris.
–Shit!
–There's a note come with it.
–Let me see that.
–“Crip space is all yours now. ”
Buster. That son of a bitch!
–Damn!
–Should've read the card first.
Brian, you around?
Brian, hi. You were trying to tell me something last night… back there at the Jerzyk farm, weren't you?
What was it?
Nothing anymore.
What's bothering you, son?
–You don't have to be afraid.
–I'm not afraid.
Between you and me, bullshit.
–Look, he's a monster.
–A what? Who?
I dreamt about him last night, only he's real.
Sometimes if you talk about it, the scary stuff goes away.
No. Not monsters.
Even monsters, Bri.
Don't come any closer.
You'll get the stuff on you.
Okay, Brian. Take it easy.
Take it easy, now.
Tell me what you're scared of, and I know we can make it go away.
No.
It's too late. I got to go.
I got to go to Hell!
What do you mean?
Don't go in that store.
–Don't go near it!
–Okay, I promise.
I'll never go in there.
What store are you talking about?
Needful Things?
It's a poison place.
And he's a poison man.
Who's a poison man?
Mr Gaunt.
Only he's not a man.
Mickey Mantle.
It's signed to you and everything.
It's yours.
Boy, you sure don't want to lose something like this.
Mickey Mantle sucks!
You asshole!
That's it for you. You're out of here!
–Watch the jacket, Henry!
–About time he's out of here.
Miserable little shit!
I'm gonna fire his butt first thing Monday morning.
Everybody that's got it coming is gonna get it now.
Get out of here!
You bastard!
–Alan, what's wrong?
–Brian Rusk tried to kill himself.
God.
He's alive.
But I was there, and I could've stopped him.
11-year-old kid tries to eat a bullet.
–Why?
–I don't know.
Polly, did Nettie… ever say anything to you about Gaunt?
Anything strange?
What do you mean?
You got any aspirin?
My head's ripped apart.
Henry Beaufort.
That bastard, runs the Mellow Tiger, cut my tires… threw me out in the rain in my beautiful jacket.
Maybe then you should just go take care of Henry… once and for all, Hugh.
–Once and for all?
–Yeah.
Don't be afraid of it, Hugh.
Guns don't kill people.
People kill people.
Hugh, I've been in this business a long time.
When I started out,
I was just a poor wandering peddler… on the blind face of a distant land.
Moving, always moving. Always gone.
Asia, Anatolia…
Palestine, Macedonia… year after year after year.
But in the end,
I always offered them weapons.
And they always bought.
But of course,
I was gone before they finally realized… what they'd purchased.
Jesus.
The young carpenter from Nazareth?
I knew him well. Promising young man.
He died badly.
What is this? Gaunt gave this to you?
–He didn't give it to me.
–It made the pain go away, didn't it?
Take it off.
It's a disease that looks like a cure.
Are you crazy?
Take it off.
I want to see what's inside this thing.
No!
Jesus.
What's the matter with you?
Don't you want me to feel better?
–Take it easy, will you?
–No, you take it easy. They're my hands.
You're not the one who can't sleep at night.
You're not the one with the oversized buttons on the telephone.
Yeah, and the oversized
Percodan prescription.
Hello.
Yes, he is. He's right here. Whoever he is.
Yeah?
Okay. That's what I thought.
Thanks, Norris.
Mr Leland Gaunt never ran a business in Akron, Ohio.
You checked on him?
He's a con man, or something worse.
There's been two murders… and an attempted suicide in this quiet town in the last 48 hours… and Mr Gaunt is at the bottom of it.
–Wilma Jerzyk killed Nettie.
Brian shot himself. You were there.
–Where you going? It's pouring.
–Good. He'll be home.
Put it on.
Put it back on, Polly.
The pain will go away.
I promise.
What's inside it? I have to know.
I'm terribly sorry. I can't tell you that.
That would spoil the fun, wouldn't it?
Does that seem a fair price to ease the pain?
My purse.
And a small favor.
What sort of favor?
–He's a liar.
–No, he's not.
–And a thief.
–No.
Alan and old Buster Keeton… have been embezzling from the town treasury, dear lady.
And the tax man is closing in.
Check his boat if you don't believe me.
All he's going to do is cause you pain.
Do as I say… and you'll never feel pain again, Polly.
You see, when everything else is gone… isn't a young woman at least entitled to her pride… the coin without which your purse is entirely empty?
Please.
I've always enjoyed those ladies who take great pride in themselves.
Polly, you must realize what a deep pleasure it is… doing business with you.
Alan?
–Wake up.
–Shit. Jesus Christ, Alan.
–He was there. Every time, he was there.
–What? Who?
Look at this.
England, Ohio, Honolulu,
Chicago, Sacramento…
Cuba, Castle Rock.
–Who? Who was where?
–Gaunt. Mr Leland Gaunt.
–Every goddamn time.
–Come on, Alan. 1894?
–Sheriff's Department.
–It's Polly, Alan.
Where are you?
I just tried calling your place.
–I'm on your boat. How could you?
–How could I what?
I want to find him. Call up Andy and John.
APB, the works.
I also want an APB on Dan Keeton,
Hugh Priest.
–I'm sorry. What?
–I found the money, Alan.
–Hold it. What money?
–The money that you and Dan Keeton… have been embezzling from the town treasury.
Wait. What are you talking about?
I can put two and two together, Alan.
I'm not stupid.
I heard you covering up for him with that tax guy.
I saw the two of you at his dealership.
I'm standing here looking at thousands of dollars on your desk.
Who's been planting this idea in your head?
You been talking to Gaunt?
Polly, listen to me.
I don't know what you found, but first of all, if I stole some money… you think I'd leave it laying around on my desk?
The guy is evil.
Don't go near him. He's Brian's monster.
Somehow… There are newspapers, Polly.
He's not a human being.
Andy, this is Norris. Listen.
Get over to the office right now.
Don't ask why. Just do it.
Polly, listen to me.
Stay where you are, okay?
Stay there. I'm coming right over, okay?
I'm coming home.
Wait a minute.
What do you mean, “He's a monster?”
I met the guy.
Listen, he looks like my uncle.
My car!
You son of a bitch!
I'll get you! I'll get all of you!
Get this, you fat fuck.
Shit! Goddamn!
Look! You think I wouldn't know… with your name on every goddamn ticket making fun of me?
God damn you, son of a bitch!
You! The little prick worked for you!
Son of a bitch.
You gave that little kid your gun.
What the hell are you thinking, Keeton?
Norris, you still alive?
Can you handle this or not?
Get your breath. Okay, you all right?
You okay? Look at me.
–Yeah!
–Get your shit together.
Lock this son of a bitch up.
I gotta go see Polly.
Alone at last.
You pathetic piece of shit.
–I am not a piece of shit!
–Shut up!
–This is for my surprise package.
–No!
–No. Don't.
–Buster.
Gotcha.
Polly.
You here?
Pol?
Myrtle!
Come on!
Myrtle!
I thought you died on the John.
Danforth.
–What's wrong?
–Nothing's wrong.
Things are better than they've been in years.
I just need a little help, that's all.
–Danforth, you're handcuffed to the door.
–Aren't you the fucking genius?
Give me that hacksaw, will you?
–What did you do?
–Forget the hacksaw.
Give me that hammer and the big screwdriver.
Now, you moron!
–Where do you think you're going?
–Danforth, I can't reach.
That's a drill. Did I ask for a drill?
–Why won't you help me?
–Danforth, I can't see.
I guess you want me to let you go… so you can run back in the house and call them.
That's one.
Now how about trying for two?
Yeah.
Danforth, you broke the law, didn't you?
Did I break their law?
How about you, Myrtle?
Did you break the law?
Did you sleep with him just to humiliate me?
–Who? Did I what?
–Norris Ridgewick…
Did you fuck him after the two of you… put up all those parking tickets all over my house?
No. And it's our house, Buster.
Stop looking at me, all of you!
Who are you?
It's me, Dan. Your master's voice.
How is it going?
I killed my wife. Is that wrong?
–I didn't mean to.
–These things happen.
–Did she deserve it?
–I don't know. I really loved her.
There are those times when you simply must hurt the ones you love, Dan.
I just can't picture Danforth Keeton doing something to someone… who didn't deserve it.
You aren't that kind of guy, are you?
No.
–I don't know anymore.
–Get a hold of yourself, Danforth.
It's no good, all this self-pity.
Why don't you hop in your car, come see me?
I've got something for you.
I think you'll get a bang out of it.
“Holy Mary, Mother of God.
Pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen.”
Hello, Henry.
Hello, Hugh.
Amen.
“Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now…
…and at the hour of our death. Amen.”
–Who are you talking to, Danny boy?
–God. Just God.
On my time?
I just want to tell you that I'm really scared.
You tell me nothing. I tell you everything.
–They have it coming, Dan. You know that.
–Yeah, I know.
Why don't you just crush them all now?
Just split the earth wide open?
Because I don't work miracles.
I'm not the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
I'm just one lonely guy.
Please.
I just want to die.
Please, I just want to die.
I won't disappoint you. I promise.
Come see me when you're done. Now dig.
I'll dig. Look.
I'll dig.
Dig. Dig! I'm digging!
–You are disgusting, Dan.
–Yes.
I like that in a person.
Yes. Thank you.
Thank you.
Sorry about Buster. I fucked up.
I'll get that son of a bitch.
Who's there?
Alan.
It's late.
–I need to talk to you, Father.
–What's the matter?
–Do you believe in the Devil, Father?
–I guess I have to.
You can't have one without the other.
Do you believe in God, Alan?
–What's he look like?
–Look like?
Yeah.
The Devil, what the hell does he look like?
He looks like you and me, I imagine.
So he could get his claws in us without our ever knowing it.
Make us do things that we normally would never do.
–Terrible things.
–No, I don't think so, Alan.
People have a choice.
–This is a good town.
–Right.
It was a good town.
A lot of decent, ordinary people.
–Only now the Devil is here.
–The Devil's always here, Alan.
He's always in our hearts.
But with the good Lord's help, we can help cast him out.
Not in our fucking hearts.
In our town, right outside, in our streets.
The Devil is in Castle Rock.
His name's Leland Gaunt.
Father.
I need your help to get rid of him.
No. Leland Gaunt is a decent man.
My God.
He got to you, too.
If there's a devil in this town, it's that damned Reverend Willie Rose.
You believe me now, Father?
You still think he's a decent man?
–The Devil just blew up your damn church!
–That's not the Devil.
It's those goddamn Baptists!
Rose!
Rose! Damn you to hell!
No!
Father!
–Get out of here!
–Kill them!
Look out!
Son of a bitch! I'll teach you.
Frank! What are you doing?
–The bastard took my Treasure Island.
–What?
Robert Stevenson, first edition!
Get out of my way!
–You okay?
–I think so.
–You all right?
–Yeah.
Go home. Watch some television.
–That's my needful thing!
–Fuck you!
You crazy son of a bitch!
Get away from there!
Come on, move it!
Go!
Move it!
Jesus Christ, Alan, all hell's broke loose.
The Baptists are running around crazy
'cause their church is on fire.
Plus somebody went and killed
Myrtle Keeton with a hammer.
What the hell happened here? Jesus.
–You son of a bitch!
–Norris, no!
–You all right?
–What?
–Are you all right?
–Never felt better.
Call the state police.
–Tell them we got a riot on our hands.
–My pleasure.
Rose! In the name of Christ, man, beg for his mercy…
'cause you'll get none from me.
Be struck down by his almighty, swift sword!
–Stop it!
–Meehan, you godless heathen!
Rot in hell, Willie Rose!
Drop it! Father, stop it! You'll kill him.
Fuck you!
Goddamn it, stop it, or I'll blow your fucking head off!
Now, there's an idea.
–Put the ax down now.
–Go to hell.
–Shoot him.
–Put it down!
–Fuck you!
–Kill him. Kill him.
Kill them all. Let God sort them out.
No!
No!
You wussy.
No more killing.
Not in Castle Rock!
Not me, not you, not anybody!
This shit stops now!
Listen to me.
All of you.
This… man here…
Leland Gaunt…
We're waiting.
He came here to destroy us.
To make us destroy ourselves.
Can't you see what's happening here?
This is what he needs.
This is what he wants.
He's got us all lined up like a bunch of human fuse boxes.
He hot wires Wilma Jerzyk to Nettie Cobb, except he does it with wires… from two other fuse boxes:
Brian Rusk and whoever it was that skinned the poor dog… because it wasn't Wilma, was it, Pete?
–No, sir.
Then he crosswires all the rest of us the same way.
What did he make you do,
Eddie, Myra, Frank?
How about you, Karen?
What price did you have to pay for your needful thing?
Father Meehan…
Reverend Rose, look at yourselves.
Cora.
Your little boy's in a hospital because he knew what this man is.
And he tried to tell me, but I got sucked in just like everybody else.
Don't you see what he's done?
We're all decent people.
We are.
And he's preyed on our weaknesses and our hatred and our greed… and our prejudice and our fear.
Don't you understand? He runs on hate.
And he's used it to turn us all against each other.
Wilma Jerzyk, Nettie Cobb.
Dan Keeton, Norris Ridgewick.
Alan Pangborn and Polly Chalmers.
He made me steal Mr Jewett's
Treasure Island.
Frank, what did he make you do?
He made me rip up
Ruth Roberts' flower bed.
He made me send that letter to Father Meehan.
I gave the rat trap to Norris Ridgewick.
He had me slash Hugh Priest's tires.
I was the one that planted the money on your boat, Alan.
–I'm sorry.
–This is pathetic. You're all so pathetic.
Look at you. Puppets, all of you.
And he's pulling the strings.
Listen, I dealt as I always do.
I show people what I have to sell… and then I let them make up their own mind.
Is that so wrong? I ask you.
You're done here, Gaunt.
You're busted.
You're finished in this town.
Alan!
Anybody's finished in this town, it's you, Pangborn.
–Finally, a man with some sense.
–You guys sound like a fucking AA meeting.
“Hi. My name is Dan…
…and I'm here to blow up your fucking town.”
You're all gonna pay big.
Pay huge!
–Be calm, folks. Don't give him a reason.
–I got a reason, you shithead.
–I got a lifetime full of reasons.
–Talk, talk, talk.
–Just blow them away, Dan.
–Don't do it, Dan.
Don't let this third-rate bastard turn you into something worse than he is.
Shut up, Pangborn!
It's too late. Don't move. Don't you move.
Time's running out, Buster.
I killed my Myrtle already.
Now I just got to die.
No, you don't, Dan.
You didn't kill your Myrtle.
He did.
–You don't have to do this.
–Yes, you do.
–Yes, I do.
–Yes, you do.
I do.
Then take me with you.
Just me. I'm the ringleader.
–Let these other people go.
–No.
No.
For Christ's sake, put this town out of its misery, Buster.
They're whipping you, Buster.
They're making you walk their walk and talk their talk.
–Just do it, Buster.
–You're just like the rest of them.
It's you!
It was you all along, you cocksucker.
Sticks and stones will break my bones, but names will never hurt me.
–Yeah, you killed my Myrtle.
–Get back.
Don't blame me.
“Blame it on the bossa nova.”
How about you take some responsibility yourself… for once in your life, Buster?
I just got one thing to say to you.
Don't call me Buster.
God!
It's all right.
–You okay, buddy?
–Yeah. You?
Shouldn't have called him Buster.
You know, there are days when I really hate this job.
This is not my best work, not by a long shot.
Sure, a few murders and a couple of rather lovely explosions.
I would hardly call it a rousing success, but what the hell?
I'll be back.
In the meantime, you and Polly, you are two terrific kids.
And you'll marry her. Trust me.
She's a lovely girl, Alan.
You'll have a wonderful family.
By the way, give my regards to your grandson.
Bob will be his name, international trade his game.
I'll see him in Jakarta, 2053.
August 14th, 10:00 a.m. A nice, sunny day.
We'll make headlines. Catch.
Look out.

Greetz to all other respected RG's out there.Let the Legend Killing Continue...
Yes?
Can I help you?
Help.
What happened?
You scrape your hand?
Come on in and, uh, we'll fix you right up.
I haven"t seen you around here.
What"s your name?
My God.
You"re hot.
You come on in now.
Sit over here.
Damn.
Because I remember a scripture that talked about the time... of Herod and the land of Canaan when the slaughter... of the innocent children of Israel ran the streets red with blood.
Red! Red! Amen!
Hallelujah!
You fall off your bike?
Now go ahead and lie back.
Let me put this in your mouth.
Come on now!
You're hot!
Lie back.
Open. There.
I'll take a look at that hand.
That's really deep.
You shouldn't be this far out.
Oh, my God!
The Norman Rockwell age is dead.
That"s according to social scientist Gareth Waltrip.
Waltrip"s recent study on small-town life in America...
claims that America"s small towns have suffered a loss...
of 15% of their population over the last decade.
And more decay is expected to come.
The report cites the sale of small farms, deterioration of family life...
and the allure of the urban economy as the primary causes.
Welcome home.
Hi, Mom.
How you doing?
Hi, Grace.
Thank you for coming.
I didn"t know what else to do.
It's okay, Mom.
I'm here now.
Hi, Doc.
Hello, Grace.
It's certainly nice to have you back.
The dean okayed me for one semester, but he wasn't real happy about it.
Maybe you shouldn't have come.
I just... Doc?
Maybe I...
I shouldn't have called.
It's okay, Mom.
Hi, Grace.
And who are you?
Are you the fairy princess?
No. I'm Margaret.
- This is a costume.
- Oh.
I had a crown butJames took it.
He did?
Where is James?
Outside.
And what's he up to?
Margaret, let go of your sister.
It's okay, Mom.
He is with that damn bike.
He never listens anymore.
You know, he won't listen to me!
- He never listens to anything I say to him.
- Mom, it... it's okay.
Grace, will you walk me to the car?
Sure, Doc.
- Welcome to Psycho Central.
- Hey, James.
God, I had no idea she was this bad.
The nightmares are what made her finally call.
Now, if it had gotten worse,
I would've called you myself personally.
But I gave her a prescription... so that she'll sleep through the night.
The really important thing is to just simply get her out of the house.
- She hasn't left the house?
- Well, agoraphobia's a funny thing.
She'll come out, but she won't take one step... past this end of the walkway here.
- You're kidding.
- That is it.
Now, what we have to do is... relax her.
Try not to let her hear any bad news.
When she sees the world as a safe place, she"ll come around.
Why, good afternoon, ladies.
Is she here for the children, Doc?
Yes, ma'am.
That and her mother.
Oh, my God.
Jane and Rosa Nock.
They don't have much, but what they have they...
Well, they try to share it with my homebound patients.
Probably left some turkey pot pie for your mother.
Oh, uh, Dr. Larson,
I, um, I hate to even ask this.
You"ve done so much.
While I'm here
I've nothing coming in, so...
- I was wondering...
- Say no more. You've got your old job back.
Thanks.
L"ll see you first thing in the morning.
To those who take strong drink,
He shall send angels.
Please...
Please, God, help me.
I have come for the children.
Charles Manson. Scorpio.
Killed eight people and an unborn baby.
Flavorite food:
Pistachio ice cream.
Lovely.
Great guitar player.
Could've been a rock star.
- I got all 30 of them.
- Hmm.
Who says kids don't have heroes anymore?
Grace, how long are you going to stay?
I'll stay 'til
Mom's feeling better.
They should just throw her in the cracker factory and call it a day.
James.
Is Mom a crackpot?
Look, Mom's just...
She's sick.
And sometimes she gets real nervous and then she gets afraid.
But you and I both know there's nothing to be afraid of, right?
- I'm not afraid of anything.
- Good.
Now sleep tight.
Grace.
I like you better than Mom.
Go to sleep.
And then the thermometer drops.
And then... it breaks.
And then... the boy...
When I turn, he tries to...
Come on, Mom.
We can beat this thing.
Now, let"s get this place cleaned up, okay?
That's all
I can remember.
I can never, never remember how it starts.
It happens every night like that.
It's just a nightmare.
Just take the pills Doc Rob gave you and it'll go away.
Why don't you go upstairs?
I'll finish up here.
Thanks, Grace.
Mom, we're not Catholic.
I know.
Crazy.
Does the word "recycling" mean anything to you?
Grace, I'm hot.
Okay. Time.
Blech.
Well, you've got a little fever, but I think you'll live.
Good. I wanna live.
Keep this washcloth on your head.
If you need anything during the night, just yell.
- Grace.
- Okay.
James is feverish too.
Oh, great.
What do you think it is?
I mean...
It's probably just the flu, Mom.
Kids get sick.
Cavalry's here.
You never were the fucking Brady Bunch.
Tell me about it.
So, looks like I'm gonna be joining you in Doc Rob's office.
No. You won't.
You're lookin' at the new nurse at Grand Island Junior High.
- No way!
- Yeah.
You can hear those teen boys' hormones just poppin' clear down the hall.
And everything's exactly the same.
How'd we grow up so fast?
You grew up a little quicker than me.
Thanks for your support.
Just maybe you should think about coming home to stay.
Look,
I'm just here to get Mom on her feet, then I'm going back to school.
Open up.
- Come on, Michael. Help me out here.
- Uh-huh.
- Tastes like a strawberry.
- You lie.
Michael. I'm sorry.
He usually doesn't mind having his temperature taken.
- It's okay. I'll just have to get the digital.
Hello. Clinic.
Well, just keep an eye on the fever and don"t let it go above 102.
I have to go.
L"m sorry. Good-bye.
So, are you going to that new treatment center in Denver?
This week. The special kid needs special treatment.
I'm not the one who needs the special treatment.
Have you got a decent clotting agent at the house?
Yeah, we've got plenty of it around the house... and we all know how to use it in case of an emergency.
Well, I'd say you've got the same fever as these other kids.
But hemophilia is serious business.
I don"t want you to get cut anymore.
One hundred percent operational, captain.
- Are you excited about this move?
- Yeah.
I'll be with you guys in just a minute, okay?
We'll get to you two next.
Hang in there, okay?
So, what do you think?
Why don't you tell me, Doctor?
I don't know.
Flevers, shakes.
Definitely flu of some kind.
But no nausea, no diarrhea. No sinus.
Viruses are always changing.
That's what makes 'em such a fun date.
I think I'll keep the more serious ones here tonight.
I hope you don't have any plans.
Mmm.
Come to me.
He's also 103.
She reads the same.
Flour patients and no fluctuation?
Mom!
Dad.
Mom. Mom.
Plenty of wet towels, yes.
If it goes two-tenths of a point higher, bring him in.
Grace.
Charlie, honey.
Oh, my God.
- Marcus?
- Dad.
Jesus, these kids are going up fast.
We've gotta break this.
Prep an ice bath.
- Charlie, I'm putting you in.
- No! Mom!
- Is it ready?
- Almost!
Honey, I'm gonna cool you off.
No! Mom!
I'm comin' in.
Grab the other one.
Mom!
You've got to stay there and cool off.
We have to cool you down.
- Grace!
- I"ll get the last one.
Calm down.
One more time.
Come on.
Help me out here.
Lie down. Down, down.
Grace!
Grace!
Okay. That's it.
We're done.
- Are you warm enough?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Well, go to sleep.
She was calling for you... by the road.
But she's come in now.
Thanks.
Thank you.
I'm gonna head off.
You keep an eye on 'em for the rest of the night,
but call me immediately if anything changes.
Okay, Doc.
You still sure you want to go into medicine?
That's it. Very nice.
Okay. All set.
Go say hello to Dad.
Hey.
You can take him home today if you want, but he seems fine.
- Just like that?
- Well, he's asymptomatic. All the kids are.
Thanks.
So... that's it?
Looks like it.
- Whatever it was, it's gone.
- Whew.
Hail Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now...
Hail Mary, mother of God.
Mary, mother of God.
Mary, mother of...
Now and at the hour of death...
God!
Sirens]
Let"s go, kid. Bedtime.
Big day tomorrow.
Big move.
So you'll be a smaller fish in a much bigger pond. That's okay.
- I liked being a big fish.
- Hey.
So, when we get to Denver, you can run for mayor.
...the slaughter of the innocent children of Israel...
ran the streets red with blood.
Red! Red!
Amen! Halleluiah!
According to God"s plan...
I can't pry that kid away from that idiot box. We ought to leave it here.
- It's not an idiot box when Oprah is on.
- That's educational.
Marcus, what did I just get done telling you?
Go to bed.
We're moving in the morning.
I can't go.
Donald? Donald!
- Sandra?
- No! No!
Sandra!
Marcus!
Sandra!
Sandra!
Margaret, did you burn yourself here?
No.
You weren't playing in any leaves, maybe poison ivy?
Okay. Sleep tight.
Okay.
16-Crash-21, Foothill.
A male white, thin build, 20 to 25 years in a rear yard...
I'm not saying that you did, and I'm not saying that you didn't.
We do have ourselves a little situation here, now don't we, Donald?
Sheriff, I don't know what happened in that house tonight,
but something attacked us, Sheriff.
And now something"s wrong with my boy.
It never looks good for the husband, Donald.
Look at him, Sheriff.
Look at him.
Marcus! Marcus, you stay near now.
We"re gonna need you.
Marcus!
Smitty, watch this guy.
Marcus!
Marcus?
Come on, son!
I know you've seen some scary things tonight, son,
but if you come on back we can help you.
Marcus!
Come on in, son!
Marcus!
All right, son!
I'm gonna count to three.
You better come in or you're gonna be in big trouble.
One... two... three!
Sheriff.
- All right, son.
- Sheriff.
We"re gonna get ya.
- Sheriff.
Sheriff.
Marcus?
Sheriff.
- What was that?
- Oh, my God!
There"s a gate down there.
They went through here.
Okay, good idea.
Grace?
Grace!
Grace!
What's the matter, honey?
You feel okay?
You hot again?
Help me.
- Yaaah!
- Aaaaah!
Mrs. Nock?
We heard about your trouble.
Something's wrong with my boy.
Sandra's dead.
They think I did it.
I need a place to hide.
There's no need to explain.
Ow!
Why do you need it?
Well, our machine will tell us what the blood is made out of.
Gross.
Now let's see what this will do for those little markings there.
- Ow!
- That doesn't hurt. It's supposed to feel good.
I don't like it.
- Did Mom ever tell you you had any allergies?
- No.
Well!
You two are in early.
Oh, she had some little rashes. I wanted to get a look at them and take some blood.
Want me to take a peek?
Oh, I don't think it's anything.
It's probably just an allergy.
I'm gonna run her to school.
So, how's your mother holding up?
She's gettin' there. The medication seems to help, and the house is shaping up.
Have you considered coming back?
Oh, Doc, I just want to handle this thing with Mom. Then I can think.
Enough said.
Police are still searching for Donald Atkins.
He"s wanted for questioning regarding the bizarre double murder...
of his wife and
Sheriff Biggs last night.
Atkins fled the crime scene and shortly afterward...
police discovered the body of the sheriff in a nearby cornfield.
Apparently, the sheriff was searching for the couple"s son, Marcus.
At the moment, there is no sign of either father or son.
Police are asking that anyone...
with any information on the two contact them immediately.
Oh. Janet.
I'm sorry, Dr. Robbie, but they've been acting so strangely.
Ever since they got sick, they just won"t listen to me.
I thought they were teasing me, you know, but I don't...
How're you doin' there,
Scott?
I'm not Scott.
Oh, then you must be Scott.
- I'm Zeke.
- I'm Caleb.
I told them to stop. They just won"t quit, Doc. What do you think it is?
What I think it is is they're pulling your leg, and I think you're about to collapse from exhaustion.
Now, go on home and get you some sleep.
I'll keep them here tonight.
- Are you sure?
- I will keep an eye on them.
I don"t want to see you back here
"til you"ve had ten solid hours.
Okay.
Well, now. All right.
You want to tell me what's going on here, Charlie?
I'm not Charlie.
Do you boys know how old I am?
Well... I"m pretty old.
I've lived here in Grand Isle my entire life.
I was around during the Second World War.
I was around during the Depression.
Did you know that?
But when I was a boy here, there was a set of twins... a couple years older than I was.
They weren't bad boys, but they had a lot of... bad things and sad things in their lives.
Do you know what I"m getting at?
Ezekiel and Caleb Cuff.
Do you know what happened to the Cuff boys?
They were killed by their father.
One of them was shot... and the other was cut with a knife.
Do you think that is a funny thing?
It is not.
And I don't think your little joke is a funny thing, either.
I'm going to suggest to your mother... that she blister your little behinds... real good.
You understand me, Scott?
I'm not Scott.
I take the pills.
I do. I take them.
But it just gets worse.
Shhh.
It'll be okay, Mom.
It will.
The dream is getting worse, Grace.
I close my eyes... and he's there.
The boy is there.
I told you to wait out front, young man.
Where is your brother?
In bed.
It's too late for that.
You boys have been looking for trouble, and now you are going to get it!
Doc!
All right, boys.
That's enough!
Boys!
Boys!
Yaaaaaah!
He's back.
Oh, my God!
Hello?
Doc?
I don't want to hurt you.
The kids. Where are the kids?
You were testing them.
You saw Marcus Atkins. Where is he?
He's gone.
Disappeared with the sheriff.
Something was wrong with him.
He saw what had happened.
He was in shock.
Wait a minute.
You murdered Sandra.
No, I didn't kill her! Something happened in the house. Something happened to Marcus.
He was sick.
They were all sick.
It was just a virus, but it's gone now.
- It did something to him. The fever.
- No, that's impossible.
Then why are you here?
What is that?
Blood tests for my sister.
- What does it say?
- I don"t know. L"m not a doctor.
What does it say?
The readings don't make any sense.
There must have been something wrong with the machine.
Something is wrong with her.
She has it too.
Whatever happened to my boy is going to happen to her...
and the rest of them, all of them.
All I want to do is find my boy, bury my wife... and get the hell out of this godforsaken town.
Why do we have to do it again? Ow.
The machine that analyzes blood didn't do it right last time, so we needed some more.
But we don't like it.
Well, I had to do it too.
Okay, guys, let's get you to school.
Margaret, are you feeling all right?
James? James.
I can't get the door.
I can't get it.
Margaret, what's wrong?
I'm not Margaret.
What do you want?
I haven't seen you around here.
What's your name?
Whew! My God, you're hot!
You stay right here.
Damn!
I remember a scripture...
that talked about the time of Herod in the land of Canaan...
when the slaughter of the innocent children of Israel ran the streets red with blood.
Red! Red!
Amen! Halleluiah!
According to God"s plan, those children of Israel...
We're going to see the doctor right now, okay?
Margaret, look at me.
Jesus.
Something's wrong with my boy.
You said he was better.
- We're doing everything we can.
- His teeth are falling out. He's calling himself names.
- What's wrong?
- I've got a lot to do.
You're not a doctor.
I want to see Doc Rob.
So do I, but right now I'm all you've got, so sit down and let me do my job.
Okay, now listen up. Mrs. Becker, take room one. You're first.
Mrs. Amos, room two.
Mrs. Crandall, room three.
Mary Anne, get back here.
You're my new nurse.
Put this in your mouth and bite on it.
Come on, Doc.
Where's Doc Rob?
I have complete chaos at the school.
There's no answer.
He must be on his way in.
I ran a blood test on her that was totally off the scale.
And Margaret's teeth, she pulled out every one of her fillings.
Grace.
I don't wanna be in charge when their heads start doing 360's and they're hurling pea soup.
Get blood from these kids, give them gauze to chew on and find Doc Rob.
James!
James?
Jamie?
Jamie?
Mom?
Mom!
Jamie?
Jamie?
We"ll show Doc Rob the blood tests and give you a call.
- I appreciate it. Thank you.
- Thanks for coming by.
- What the hell is going on?
- That was County General.
They"re sending out the toxicology team in the morning.
A voodoo doctor might be a better idea.
I want to know where the fuck Rob is!
And where are all the files on these kids?
Every medical record on a child is missing.
Doc Rob must've taken them. I'm gonna take these results and go by his house.
He"s an old man.
Maybe he kicked it.
Grace, don't even think about it.
What?
Mary Anne, this blood sample...
Mine looks fine, but the kid's is...
What is it?
Where are my boys?
Doc Rob has my boys.
I'm going to get them right now.
Mary Anne, this blood is not properly oxygenating.
It's decayed. It's like it's mixed with something dead.
That's it. Check, please.
I'm out of here.
- Mary Anne, come on.
- No way, Grace! This shit is creeping me out big time!
Run the rest of those samples and look for something chemical.
I'm going to Doc Rob's.
Come on, Margaret.
Come on.
Get in the car.
- Leave the child.
- Look, we have to find a doctor.
Leave the child.
You and I have someplace to go.
Margaret, you have to stay with Mary Anne for now.
Okay, drive.
Let's go.
Mrs. Nock, this is Grace.
I know who it is.
Come.
Listen.
Harvest moon's up.
Do you know what that is?
Traveling preachers.
Tent revivals.
Old-time religion.
Those preachers wanted our money.
And we wanted to believe.
There was a boy... that boy... born of sin to a young girl.
It was a scandal... back then.
She up and left him.
One of those travelin' preachers took him in.
So the boy took to preachin'.
Like it was in his blood.
He had the gift, he did.
We'd come from miles around just to hear him.
He"d scorch you with the fear of hellfire,
then raise you up to Heaven, that boy.
They called him
Josiah.
Josiah, the amazing boy preacher.
Great crowds would gather round to listen.
And he made them adult preachers rich as kings, he did.
But somethin' was wrong.
Summer after summer, the tents would come around, and the boy was still just a boy.
Oh, shit.
Every summer, the amazing boy preacher would be the same age, the same size.
They knew if he grew up, the money would stop.
So them wicked preachers...
tried everything:
Kept him from sleep, fed him quicksilver... poison.
To stunt his growth, but it didn"t work.
But it just made the boy crazy.
Finally, they took the step.
Gave him over.
Wh... What do you mean,
"gave him over"?
The darkness keptJosiah small.
But we learned the secret, left the tents.
Preachers didn't have no use forJosiah no more,
so they left him.
Like his mother done.
He done them preachers back good.
With a harvestin' scythe.
Up on the Spelling ranch.
In the dark of night.
Jesus Christ.
So we did what we had to.
Townspeople... dragged that boy out of the house.
Dragged him out to the cornfield... and burned him up.
- And the boy cried.
- I could feel him.
All through the night...
I could still feel it.
Long after he should"ve been dead.
Next day we searched the fields,
gathered every one of the bones, the ashes.
And deep in a well...
we sealed the soul of that wicked boy preacher.
He's found a child.
One like himself.
And when that like child takes his place,
Josiah will take them all.
What do you mean,
"like child"?
Left. Abandoned.
You must kill the boy.
Send his spirit to hell!
Take back the like child!
Don"t make my mistake!
- Let's go.
- It all starts with a lie, girl.
- It all starts with a lie.
- Let's go.
Take back the child!
What is it?
What do you know?
This thing has got my boy.
You tell me what you know now.
Margaret is the like child.
I abandoned her and I lied to her.
Your sister?
She's my daughter.
Get in the fucking car.
Margaret, I think it's time to go.
Margaret!
Margaret?
Margaret?
Margaret!
- Grace!
- Oh, my God.
Margaret!
- We have to find her! We've gotta get her back!
- Wait a minute. Hold on.
- Look. Look at this. What is this?
- It's mercurochrome ointment.
Margaret hated it. That stuff and fillings. They"re both made of mercury.
- The boy. The boy was poisoned with quicksilver.
- Right.
Quicksilver is mercury.
Where's the supply closet?
Rosa.
It"s time.
Your boy's come home.
I am Ezekiel and
I bring Him my flesh.
I am Caleb and
I bring Him my flesh.
Let"s take the truck.
No, no, no.
You drive.
By the looks of the moon, we got about an hour.
- Where are we going?
- Spelling farm.
That's where he killed those preachers and where the townspeople burned him.
Right, but what are we gonna do when we get there?
I don't know, but I see a lot of blood flowing.
And if my son gets as much as a cut on him, he's gonna bleed to death.
Let's go.
I'm Herbert.
He comes with the blood of children.
With my soul,
He will lead them.
What are you doing?
Spiking these shells with mercury.
If this kid really hates this stuff, then this oughta send him right back where he came from.
Watch it!
Where the hell are you going?
Short cut.
We bring Him our flesh.
We bring Him our flesh.
We bring Him our flesh.
We bring Him our flesh!
We bring Him our flesh!
We bring Him our flesh!
We bring Him our flesh!
We bring Him our flesh!
We bring Him our flesh!
We bring Him our flesh!
We bring Him our flesh!
We bring Him our flesh!
We bring Him our flesh!
We bring Him our flesh!
We bring Him our flesh!
These two red ones, they're filled with mercury. Use these on the bad kid.
The black ones, they're regular 12-gauge, all right?
- And what do we use those for?
- I hope not to shoot children.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
That's Marcus.
Grace, come on.
Let's go. Let's go.
- What the fuck was that?
- I don't know. Come on. Let's go.
Come on.
Damn. I hope we brought enough of this stuff.
Grace. Grace.
I gotta get Marcus.
You keep the gun.
Margaret?
Margaret?
Hang in there.
Marcus, hang in there.
Don't die on me now.
Just hang in there, buddy.
This'll do it, okay?
This is gonna do it.
Just hang in there, okay?
Margaret?
My God.
Bastard.
Oh.
I hope she can swim.
Doc? Oh, shit.
Shit! Black ones.
Shit!
I hope you can swim.
Hey, you"re gonna be all right.
You"re gonna be all right.
Come on.
Come on!
Come on, Margaret.
Come on.
Come on.
Thank God.
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
I don't think those are so funny anymore.
Well, I think she'd be happy about that.
Come on.
Let's go.
Okay, let"s say good-bye to Marcus and Donald.
Take care of Mommy, you hear?
- Thanks a lot, Grace.
- Thank you.
- Bye, Marcus.
- Bye.
Mom, who will bring our stuff to our new house?
That will be the moving men.
It"ll be fun.
Now, you ready?
Ready, James?
James?
James!
Let's go.
My name is Ash, and I am a slave.
- Aah !
Close as I can figure it, the year is 1300 A.D., and I'm being dragged to my death.
It wasn't always like this.
I had a real life once.
A job.
Ash to price check four.
Um, hardware, aisle 12.
Shop smart.
Shop S-mart.
I had a wonderful girlfriend, Linda.
Together, we drove to a small cabin in the mountains.
It seems an archaeologist had come to this remote place... to translate and study his latest find,
"Necronomicon Ex Mortis,"
"The Book of the Dead."
Bound in human flesh and inked in blood, this ancient Sumerian text contained bizarre burial rites, funerary incantations and demon resurrection passages.
It was never meant for the world of the living.
The book awoke something dark in the woods.
It took Linda.
- And then it came for me.
It got into my hand and it went bad.
So I lopped it off at the wrist.
But that didn't stop it.
It came back.
- Big time.
Ah !
Aah !
My God !
How do you stop it ?
- Surround the stranger !
All right, you men, fall in !
All o' ya, keep a pace !
Where in the hell--
Stand fast, hellhound !
No, no.
Easy now, chief.
Uh, I don't know how I got here,
- and, uh, uh, I'm not looking for any trouble.
What a piece of armor this is !
- Wise man !
- Fall back ! Come on, all you men.
Back on your horses.
Come on !
My lord, I believe he is the one written of in the Necronomicon.
He who's prophesied to fall from the heavens... and deliver us from the terrors of the Deadites.
What, that buffoon ?
Likely... he's one of Henry's men !
- Kneel, rapscallions !
I say to the pit with him !
You shall soon learn the horrors of the pit.
- To the pit !
- You miserable bast--
- Get him !
- Get off of me !
- Let me go !
- Chain him !
Ah, you're gonna have a little bit of wee fun, mate.
To the castle !
Pick up your feet !
Stop draggin' your feet !
Come on !
Move along !
Come on, now.
Come on, pick it up.
Have a taste of this !
You men got something to look forward to... when you get back to the castle.
Lord Arthur approaches !
Raise the portcullis !
Lord Arthur !
Lord Arthur approaches !
That's lovely, isn't it ?
Move it in.
Move it, you worthless--
- Get on !
Move it up, boys.
God save the king !
God save the king.
We love him !
Arthur !
He's back !
Lord Arthur, where is my brother ?
Did he not ride with you ?
Aye, and fought valiantly.
But last night he fell in battle to Duke Henry's men.
I'm sorry, Sheila.
Come on.
You cretin !
Ah, stop it, you bastard !
You barbarian !
- Oh, no ! Stop it ! Stop it !
Get outta here, you little brat !
Foul thing !
A pox on you, brute !
Thou art a murderer !
A black murderer !
My brother's death shall be avenged !
Company, halt !
Get that yoke off 'im !
Kill them !
Put them into the pit !
You, sir, are not one of my vassals.
Who are you ?
Who wants to know ?
I am Henry the Red,
Duke of Shael, Lord of the Northlands and leader of its peoples.
Well, hello,
Mr. Fancy Pants.
I got news for you, pal. You ain't leadin' but two things right now--
Jack and shit, and Jack left town.
Shut your bleedin' hole !
Shut your bleedin' hole !
Gentlemen, Lord Arthur !
There is an evil awakened in this land, and while my people fight for their very souls against it, you, Henry the Red, wage war on us !
Charlatan !
Aah !
It was you who first turned your swords on us !
And this evil has befouled my people as well !
Your people are no better than the foul corruption... that lies in the bowels of that pit.
Right, you're no better.
May God have mercy upon your souls.
God's name !
What hell-spawned thing lurks there ?
Into the pit with those bloodthirsty sons of 'hores !
No ! No !
No, no ! Aah !
Oh ! Heavenly God !
He's escaping !
- Hold to !
- Hold him !
- Who's next ?
- It's him. Aye, he trembles !
They don't look so clever now, do they ?
He's frightened !
He's frightened white !
Whoa ! Whoa !
Wait a minute. Hold it.
W-Wait a minute.
You gotta understand, man.
I never even saw these assholes before.
- Get him in there !
- He trembles !
He's begging !
- What are you waitin' for ?
- Henry !
You gotta tell him you don't know me.
We never met.
Tell him.
I do not think he'll listen, lad.
Look.
I'm tellin' you, you got the wrong guy.
I'm tellin' you, you got the wrong guy.
Uh, wh-whoa.
- Aah !
How do you like the pit ?
Isn't the pit wonderful ?
- Hai-ya !
- Why, you--
Ha !
Spikes.
Hey ! He says, "Spikes."
Give him spikes !
Make way !
Strange one !
- Strange one !
Yaaah !
Yes !
Damn you.
Damn you !
You know, your shoelace is untied.
All right.
Who wants some ?
Who's next, huh ?
How 'bout it ?
Who wants some, huh ?
Who wants to have a little ?
You.
You want some more ?
Huh ?
You want a little ?
Do ya ? Do ya ?
Do ya want some more?
Huh ? Huh ?
Now get on those horses and get outta here.
Let 'em go !
- Halt !
Thank you, generous hosts !
Sword boy !
For that arrogance,
I shall see you dead.
Yeah.
All right, you primitive screwheads, listen up.
See this ?
- This is my boom stick !
It's a 12-gauge, double-barreled Remington.
S-mart's top of the line.
You can find this in the sporting goods department.
That's right. This sweet baby was made in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
Retails for about $109.95.
It's got a walnut stock, cobalt blue steel and a hair trigger.
That's right, shop smart.
Shop S-mart.
You got that ?
- Yes, sir. Right.
- Yes, sir.
Now I swear, the next one of you primates... even touches me--
Now, let's talk about how I get back home.
I prithee to forgive me, m'lord.
I believed thee one of Henry's men.
First you wanna kill me, now you wanna kiss me.
Blow.
So what's the deal ?
Can you send me back or not ?
Only the Necronomicon has the power.
An unholy book which we also require.
Within its pages are passages that can send you back to your time.
Only you, The Promised One, can quest for it.
I don't want your book.
I don't want your bullshit.
Just send me back to my own time.
Pronto, today, chop--
- You shall die !
You shall never obtain the Necronomicon !
We shall feast upon your souls !
Oh !
- It's a trick. Get an axe.
- Guards, stop it !
- Catch the witch !
- Death to the witch !
Have some porridge !
Ah, my eyes ! I'm blind !
Oh, God, I'm blind !
No, don't !
Yo, she-bitch.
- Let's go.
Ya-hoo !
Hee-ya !
- Hee-ya !
If the Necronomicon fell into the hands of the Deadites, all mankind will be consumed by this evil.
Now will thou quest for the book ?
That one.
Hee-ya !
Groovy.
What's the matter ?
You raised in a barn ? Shut the door.
Probably was raised in a barn with all the other primitives.
The wise men say that thou art The Promised One.
'Tis said that thou wilt journey for the book to help us, and that thou wilt lead our people against the evil.
The only reason I'm going to get the book is to get home.
I believe that thou wilt be leaving in the morning.
Don't touch that, please.
Your primitive intellect... wouldn't understand alloys and compositions... and things with molecular structures in the--
What are you doin' here anyway ?
I wanted to say that all of my-- all of my hopes and prayers go with you, and I made this for thee.
Good, I could use a horse blanket.
Gimme some sugar, baby.
Hyah ! Come on, boy !
Hyah !
Hyah !
- Steady now. Whoa.
What ? What is it ?
This path will lead you to an unholy place.
A cemetery. There, the Necronomicon awaits.
When thou retrievest the book from its cradle, you must recite the words,
"Klaatu barada nikto."
Klaatu barada nikto.
Okay.
Well, repeat them.
- Klaatu barada nikto.
- Again !
I got it, I got it !
I know your damn words, all right ?
Now you get this straight, the both of you.
If I get that book, you send me back.
After that,
I'm history. Hyah !
What is it, boy ?
Hyah ! Come on !
Hyah ! Come on !
Aah ! Come on !
Come on, you !
Hey, let's scare this guy good ! Come on.
Ramming speed !
Ooh !
Ready, aim, fire !
- Ooh !
- Get away !
Whoa !
- Oh, God ! Oh, no !
- Oh--
- Oh !
- You lousy little--
Oh, no !
Ooh, no ! Oh, my !
Uh, ooh, aah !
- Lift up !
- Oh, ooh-hoo-ha !
- Ooh, aah !
Aah-ha-ha !
Heh heh heh-heh--
Whoa !
## London Bridge is falling down #
# Falling down #
# Falling down #
- # My fair lady ## Ha !
Ooh !
Is he up ?
How is he ?
Hey, he's gettin' up.
Hmm, what a horrible nightmare.
Wait a minute.
Oh, God !
I can't move !
Aah !
- And go !
- Open wide.
Geronimo !
- Hooray !
- Hooray !
- Ah !
Okay, little fella.
How about some hot chocolate, huh ?
How'd you like the taste of that, huh ?
How'd you like the ta--
Aah, uh, ugh, oh !
Ah ! Oh !
Let me out !
Oh, dear God, it's growing bigger !
Ooh, ooh, I'm blind.
I'm blind. Bleh.
Yip, yip, yah !
Oh, hey ! Where are you takin' me ?
Uh, oh, ooh !
What are you ?
Are you me ?
I'm bad Ash, and you're good Ash.
You're goody little two-shoes.
## You're goody little two-shoes goody little two-shoes #
# Little goody two-shoes
Little goody two-shoes #
# Little goody two-shoes
Little goody two-shoes
Little goody two-shoes #
- Ow !
# Little goody two-shoes ##
Aah !
Good, bad.
I'm the guy with the gun.
That'll teach you.
Yeah, that'll teach you.
You shall never retrieve the Necronomicon !
You'll die in the graveyard before you get it !
- What's that you got on your face ?
- Huh ?
I'll come back for you !
- Hyah !
Come on, boy !
Hyah !
Three books ?
Wait a minute.
Hold it.
Nobody said anything about three books.
L-Like what am I supposed to do ?
Take one book, or all books, or, or what ?
Well.
Whoa. Wrong book.
Ow !
Aah ! Ooh !
Ooh ! Ooh, you !
I'll get back to you.
Well...
Well... seems fairly obvious.
Ooh, wait a minute. The words.
All right, all right, all right.
Say the words.
Klaatu... barada...
Iu-- necktie.
Nectar, n-- nickel.
Noodle.
It's an "N" word.
It's definitely an "N" word.
It's definitely an "N" word.
Klaatu barada n--
Okay, then.
That's it.
Hey. Wait a minute.
Everything's cool.
I said the words. I did !
- Oh ! Oh ! No, wait ! Oh !
You people, seek cover !
To the parapet !
Seek your children !
- Steady the horses !
Something's wrong.
Something's amiss.
Where'd you go ?
Where'd you g--
Oh, oh, aah !
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
Ow ! I'll crush ya !
I'll mash ya into paste, you bony cre--
- Hyah !
I'm through being their garbage boy.
I did my part.
Now I want back, like in the deal. Hyah !
I... live... again.
There ! The Promised One !
The Promised One's returned !
Raise the portcullis !
Welcome home !
We're saved !
- The Necronomicon !
- Truly he is The Promised One !
- He's brought the Necronomicon !
- How are ya ?
- He's brought the book !
- Yeah, great, great.
- Good boy !
- Get the fuck outta my face !
The Necronomicon, quickly.
Did you bring the Necronomicon ?
- Yeah, it's, it's just that--
- Just what ?
Nothin'.
Here.
Now send me back.
Like in the deal.
When you removed the Necronomicon from the cradle, did you speak the words ?
- Yeah, basically.
- Did you speak the exact words ?
Look, maybe I didn't say every single, little tiny syllable,
- no, but basically I said 'em, yeah.
- Dung-eating fool !
Thou hast doomed us all !
When thou misspoke the words, the army of the dead awoke !
Now, whoa, whoa, right there, spinach chin.
You said you could clean this mess up once you got that book.
You said there was a passage that could get rid of this thing and send me back.
It's true, the book still possesses the power to send you back, but to us it is useless !
The evil has a terrible hunger for the Necronomicon, and it will come here to get it.
We had a deal.
You wanted the damn book,
I got it for ya.
I did my part, now you send me back.
Very well.
As we are men of our word, we shall honor our bargain.
The wise men shall return you to your own time.
Yeah ?
- I thought he was the one.
- Yeah, right.
'Cause that was the deal.
So when do you think we can... start with all the thing and the--
He's nothin' but a traitor, he is !
When do you think we can start... with all the, uh, ceremony and, uh--
Agh ! Wretched excuse for a man !
The wise men were fools to trust in you.
I knew he couldn't be trusted.
We put our trust in him.
I still believe that thou wilt help us.
Oh, Sheila, don't you get it ? It's over.
I didn't have what it took.
So long.
But what of the things that we've shared ?
What of all the sweet words that you spoke in private ?
Aw, well--
Well, that's just what we call
"pillow talk," baby. That's all.
It was more than that.
I still have faith in thee.
I still believe that thou wilt stay and save us. I--
Coward !
- Look there ! A demon !
Ash ! Help me !
Sheila !
Yaaah !
- Shoot the bloody thing !
- Hold your arms ! You'll hit the girl !
Uh, me sword !
Yaaah !
Damn you !
Dig, damn you !
Dig faster !
I shall command every worm-infested son-of-a-bitch...
- that ever died in battle !
- Thank you, sir !
- You there, handsomely now.
- Aye, my liege.
We shall storm their castle and get my book !
Hoist, you damnable varlets !
Welcome back to the land of the living.
Now pick up a shovel and get digging !
- Bring on the wench !
- Gimme some sugar, baby.
Well.
Now, ain't you a sweet little thing ?
Don't touch me, you foul thing !
Come on.
That's it.
We got plans for you, girly-girl.
Move !
Have you lost your bones, you decomposed gobs ? Get thee hence !
A scout approaches !
- Whoa !
- Hey, get his horse.
Arise.
My lord, an army of the dead gather in the wilderness.
- They approach the castle.
- How far from here?
But two days' ride.
These winged ones are only the first of them.
Perhaps we should leave as soon as possible.
- We could be safe in the mountains.
- Yes, the mountains.
- We must flee !
- It is written. It has been foretold.
- They'll take our souls.
They'll swallow our souls.
- I'm afraid !
- I don't want to die !
That's it.
Go ahead and run.
Run home and cry to mama !
Me ?
I'm through runnin' !
I say we stay here and fight it out.
Are all men from the future loudmouthed braggarts ?
Nope. Just me, baby.
Just me.
How will we fight an army of the dead at our castle walls ?
How will you fight that ?
More words ?
Most of our people have already fled.
We are but 60 men.
Then we'll get Henry the Red and his men to fight with us.
Now... who's with me ?
I'll stand by ya.
You can count on my steel.
I'll offer up my courage.
- Me sword's by his side.
- I'm with you !
- I'll bend my bow to your will, sir.
- And mine !
We'll stay !
Hail ! Hail !
Hail ! Hail !
Hail ! Hail ! Hail !
Well, my dear, say hello to the boys.
- There's a sight for sore bones.
I may be bad, but I feel... good.
- Who rules ?
- To you, my lord.
You, sir. To the castle.
The castle !
Hurry up now.
The castle ! Let's push.
Heave-ho.
Good. Yeah.
Ha ! Hoo !
Hai-ya !
Ha ! Hoo ! Hai-ya !
Yeah !
They're coming !
The Deadites approach !
There's so damn many of 'em.
Maybe--
Just maybe my boys can stop 'em from gettin' the book.
Yeah.
And maybe
I'm a Chinese jet pilot.
Battle stations ! All right, get those rocks up, mister, on the double !
Ready the catapults !
By God, let's give 'em what for.
And halt !
- Company, halt !
- Company, halt !
I'll rip his balls off.
Bring forth the scout !
Whoa.
My lord, we are positioned on both fronts.
Fine, fine, fine.
Where are they keeping my book ?
There, my lord, beyond the wall.
The parapet. That would be the most likely place.
Right. Bring me forth into that castle !
- Forward !
- Forward !
Cry havoc and let loose the dogs of war !
To the castle !
Fly, mate ! Fly !
Death to the mortals !
Arrows.
Torch boy !
Steady.
Fire !
- Advance, you beasts, advance !
Oh ! Oh !
Yeah, baby !
- All right !
Sire, there's a second division approaching from the south.
Ram the gate !
Catapults.
Catapults out !
Yeah !
Fire !
Look there !
Yeah !
- Seek cover !
- Watch out !
- Make way !
Oh !
Oh, you miserable bags of bones !
Pick yourselves up and sally fo...
Sally for--
Sally forth.
Come on, you miserable wretches.
Lower.
Heave !
Forward !
Buttress the door, now !
Hold fast !
- Back !
- Stone these creatures !
Damn you !
Ooh, that's gotta hurt.
Go, you creatures !
Arrows !
Load !
Fire !
- Heave ! Put your... backbones into it.
We've broken through !
The castle is ours !
Kill the mortals !
- Get it achieved and fast !
Their ranks are broken !
Have at them !
Ha ! Hoo ! Hai-ya !
Ha ! Hoo ! Hai-ya !
Pull back !
Man the parapet !
Protect the book.
God save us all.
Say hello to the 21st century. Yeah !
Come on !
I got plenty for everybody !
Look out !
- Whoo !
- Bye-bye.
It's the one in the cart we want !
Get him !
- Yaaah !
Yaaaaah !
Sheila ?
- We've secured the courtyard, my lord.
Excellent.
Ooh ! Hey ! Look out !
- Hey, you're mine, sweetie.
Get off of her !
Gotcha !
Damn you !
- My lord.
- Stay with the book.
The book's where we are.
The Red ! The Red !
Duke Henry and his men have come !
Blows, blood... and death !
Duke Henry ! Ha-ha !
Die !
Onward, valiant cousins !
Their ranks are broke !
Oops !
Hello !
There ya go.
The book is mine.
I'll cut your gizzard out.
- Hey, where'd he go ?
Come to papa.
Get him !
Oh, you crazy bitch, get off of me !
Ha !
Right.
You found me beautiful once.
Honey, you got real ugly.
There we are.
So you wanna play rough, eh ?
Okay.
Oh.
All right, all right.
Prepare to die !
You're going down !
- I'm goin' up.
- I'm comin' for ya.
Come on !
- Oops. Excuse me.
- Come on.
All right !
You're pissin' me off, you ugly son of a bitch !
I'll spoil those good looks.
Back-stabber !
Hold still !
Tallyho !
- We can't hold the battlements!
We will hold !
We must protect the book !
I got a bone to pick with you.
Come on.
Slice that gizzard open.
Now you're mine.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
At last, the book.
I possess the Necronomicon.
I've crushed your pathetic army.
Now I'll have my vengeance.
Buckle up, bonehead,
'cause you're goin' for a ride.
Huh ?
Victory's ours !
- Retreat ! Retreat !
- Let's get the hell out of here !
- Oh.
- Tricky ones, they are.
If it's a fight you want--
Watch 'em, lads.
They're an untrust worthy lot.
Move yourself, lad !
- Your hand, man. Godspeed !
- Hey, Henry. Yeah, nice goin'.
- My lady.
- Arthur.
- Well won, my friend.
- We've won the day.
- Yeah !
- Yeah !
We're brothers and a new kingdom shall be born !
The book tells us that once you drink this liquid... and recite the words,
"Klaatu barada nikto," thou shalt awaken in thine own time.
Remember, you must recite the words exactly.
Hyah !
I thought about staying.
They offered me the chance to lead them, to teach them, to-- to be king.
- Uh-huh.
- But my place is here.
- So I swallowed the juice, said the words and here I am.
- Did you say... the words right this time ?
Well, maybe I didn't say every single, tiny little syllable, no, but basically
I said 'em, yeah.
Basically.
You know that story about how you could've been king ?
I, uh, I think it's kind of cute.
Yeah.
- Die !
Lady, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave the store.
Who the hell are you ?
Name's Ash.
Housewares.
I'll swallow your soul.
Come get some.
Sure, I could've stayed in the past.
Could've even been king.
But in my own way,
I am king.
Hail to the king, baby.
He died for love.
Born just after the Civil War,
Daniel Robitaille was the son of slaves, an artist by trade.
A wealthy landowner commissioned him to paint the portrait of his daughter.
They fell in love. She became pregnant.
Her father had his thugs chase the poor man through the town.
When they caught him, they sawed off his right hand with a rusty blade.
A nearby beehive was raided, and the honeycomb smeared over his bleeding, mutilated body.
The crowd that had gathered fled as the bees came for him.
He died for love.
His resurrection began as rumor, and grew into myth.
Say his name five times in the mirror and he would appear.
A hook had replaced his severed hand.
Sorrow and hate fill his eyes.
Bees buzz about his lips.
The myth has traveled from place to place, taking root in the most desperate areas.
Even here, in New Orleans, murders have been committed in his name.
Yes, but is he real?
Cabrini Green, Chicago, 1992.
Helen Lyle becomes so obsessed by the myth that she takes on the persona of Candyman, killing her victims with a hook.
Cabrini residents believe she was the Candyman.
- What about you, Doctor Purcell?
- Do I believe in Candyman?
I believe in the myth.
But the fact? The flesh and blood? No.
- I'm afraid not.
- Prove it.
Candyman,
Candyman,
Candyman,
Candyman,
Candyman.
Well, that is a relief.
My publisher would never have forgiven me. Imagine the headlines:
"Cambridge Scholar Eviscerated with Hook on Book Tour."
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like you to meet our Candyman, Peter.
Oh, I'm sorry. These streets have got me all turned around.
We were a little shy back there, were we?
- It's a gift?
- "To Ethan".
Ethan Tarrant.
Ethan, I'm sorry about what happened to your father.
- He came to you for help.
- Have you any idea
- how many people contact me?
- My father wasn't a crackpot.
I'm not saying he was.
You told him there was no Candyman.
You told him to say the name... and now he's dead.
Look, Ethan, I've seen this happen before.
People get sucked into the myth.
There's no myth.
Daniel Robitaille was real.
Daniel Robitaille has been dead and buried for a very long time.
He's here.
You called him.
I'm sorry. I can't help you.
You're next, Purcell.
- Groin to gullet.
- You're as crazy as your father was.
Give me a shot of single malt.
Fucking murderer!
Hey!
Get him the fuck outta here!
You're next, Purcell.
Get out!
It's... my book.
WBOV.
Are you with me, New Orleans?
Do ya hear me? This is the Kingfish coming to you at 96.2 FM.
Anointed and appointed.
Just three more days, Crescent City, three days until Lent.
So let's have it, the merriment before the penance, and the feast before the fast.
The Kingfish gonna keep y'all company all the way down.
Hey, brothers and sisters, y'all know what "carnival" means in Latin?
Well, the Kingfish went to the good schools, so he can tell you all about it.
"Carnival: farewell to the flesh."
That's what it means.
I like that a lot. "Farewell to the flesh."
Yeah, you right.
And farewell to all that floodin', as far as I'm concerned.
That's right. Look at it.
The banks of the mighty Mississippi are ready to spill their seed.
Just look at that sky out there.
It's ready to rain on us again.
And the clouds?
Well, now, brothers and sisters, they're not the only thing threatenin' the Crescent City.
We're talking murder, mes amis.
Cos so we've heard before, the hook man, kerchunk.
So when you pull on your costume and turn to admire yourself in the mirror, please keep those lips locked tight.
Do not call his name.
Is he always so angry?
Guess so.
- And why do you think that is?
- Cos he's been hurt.
"Cos he's been hurt"!
Who hurt him, Matthew?
- Everyone.
- Hey, Annie. Look.
Come here.
- If you stay there, I can paint you too.
- Ever tried using paper, Liz?
No way. I hate paper.
There's nothing on it.
But that's why it needs you to fill it up.
Besides, you can't keep a mirror, darlin'.
Why not? It's not going anywhere.
- It's your brother.
- It's only a couple of days till Mardi Gras.
- I said I'd get them plaster of Paris.
- I know, for their mask.
Annie, if there's one thing these kids understand, it's taking care of themselves.
- I'll be back in the morning.
- Just go.
Hey, Pam.
You movin' in here, or what?
No.
No, let's go.
- Howdy, Miss Tarrant.
- Hi, Greg.
- Aren't you ready yet?
- Oh! Lord, I hate that thing.
- Then why leave it on all the time?
- Annie, please. Don't start with me.
- Mother, what did Ethan say?
- Well, he barely even spoke to me.
He only wants to see you. Oh, Annie.
I mean, murder.
- Hello, Mrs. Tarrant.
- Is that what you call a speedy response?
- Pardon me, ma'am?
- I set that alarm off 45 seconds ago.
Ma'am, we try to respond as fast as we can. But we do need a codeword.
Codeword? Oh, I'll give you a codeword.
- "Dickhead".
- Mother.
When you reach my age, Annie, you can say whatever the hell you want.
Does Dr. Lewis let you drink?
Dr. Lewis thinks I'm dyin' of cancer.
Says it doesn't make a difference what I do.
We'll get that taken in.
You know the only thing I regret?
I never had a chance to grow out the grey.
I can tell you the exact day I got ill.
It was the day your father died.
- Stay back. Stand back.
- Can you comment on your son's arrest?
Just stay back!
Paul! Paul, just help my mother!
- Excuse me!
- Give us a comment!
Here you go, Octavia.
A cup of java with all the fixings.
It's the chicory in it.
It helps settle my stomach.
You are a life-saver, Paul.
He'll make a great father someday.
Course, I'll be food for the worms by then.
I'd like a winter funeral... especially with this climate.
Mrs. Tarrant? Ma'am.
- Maybe I should see him alone first.
- Yes, maybe that'd be best.
I wouldn't want to upset him.
We'll go to the cafeteria.
I hear the gumbo is good and hot.
Hey! My guardian angel.
- How are you?
- I've been better.
How's Mom?
She's coping.
- Do you want me to call the dean?
- There's... there's no need.
- He kicked me out three months ago.
- What?
Come on, Annie. Law school was Dad's dream, not mine.
- I hated the classes, the teachers...
- The bar-hopping in the Quarter.
Just tell me what happened last night.
This asshole sat down and he ordered a drink.
He started chewin' on his ice...
You're full of shit, Ethan, and you know it!
What happened?
- You're not supposed to be in here.
- The guy's a fuckin' freak.
- Too much inbreeding, if you ask me.
- Rules, Ray.
Think I'll let some country-club pissant slip through our fingers?
The boy is getting sloppy.
The first three victims were John Does.
Until number four: Mr. Coleman Tarrant.
- Murdered like all the rest.
- And guess who found Daddy's body?
None other than young Ethan.
What is going on?
Are you protecting someone?
Am I protecting someone?
- I'll call Clay McPherson and...
- No, no, no.
- No lawyers.
- Family has some friends.
Can't help him now.
I knew kids like him in school.
Always thought they were better than me, cos they lived in some fucking mansion up on Esplanade Avenue.
You can't charm your way out of this one.
We're talking about murder.
Don't you get it, Annie? I did it.
I confessed. End of story.
Looks like I'm gonna be enjoyin'
Mardi Gras with my husband after all.
I know what this is about.
- Really?
- Sometimes people wanna be punished, even when they've done nothing wrong.
You didn't kill Dad, Ethan.
You were just in the house that night.
- This has nothing to do with Dad.
- I think it does.
- Well, drop it anyway.
- What did you see?
- Leave it alone.
- Ethan!
I said, leave it alone!
- Damn!
- Time's up.
- I'm gonna find out what happened.
- No! No!
I'm sorry, Miss Tarrant, but this is an open-and-shut case.
- He hasn't even hired an attorney yet.
- Your brother made a full confession.
What kind of evidence do you have?
There's no weapon, no blood on him.
- People heard him threaten the victim.
- That doesn't mean he killed him.
Look, we're talking about more than Dr. Purcell's murder here.
What are you saying?
It's possible that Ethan was involved in your father's death as well.
They were killed in exactly the same way.
This is insane.
My brother worshipped our father.
You have no idea what he's been through.
Find yourself another scapegoat.
My brother didn't do this.
We'll see.
This is going out to the man with the hook. Hey, man, chill.
Relax. Have some gumbo or somethin'.
Even the Kingfish know when to draw the line.
Going somewhere, Ben?
- Oh, yeah. I got to do the do.
- Oh, oh. He's got to do the do.
Hey, what's the matter?
You don't like my cooking?
- That too hot for you?
- I'm not hungry.
You're a lightweight.
Do you think a family can be cursed?
When we were growing up, we thought we were the luckiest kids in the world.
Ethan was so smart.
Daddy thought he'd be the first
Tarrant in the Supreme Court.
But when he died, there was this... cloud.
Annie. Annie!
You gotta start thinkin' of the good things in life.
You got a whole classroom full of kids who give a damn because of you.
Plus, you got a stud-muffin for a husband.
At least, your mama thinks so.
- Whaddaya say we get outta here?
- Thought you'd never ask.
Hey! Get the hell outta here!
Goddamn tourist.
Gotta do the do.
- Jesus!
- I'm sorry. I thought you heard me.
It's lookin' good.
I just can't seem to finish it.
The happy family.
We'll do better. I promise.
Daddy loved this house.
Even after we moved out, he'd always drive us past it.
It was as if he was drawn to it.
Are you with me, Crescent City?
Do you feel it comin' on?
When the Catholic Church realized they couldn't rid us of our pagan ways, they invited...
- What's that for?
- Just in case.
That's a good idea, honey.
Jesus.
This explains a lot.
Paul, I haven't lived here for 13 years.
Annie!
I don't think we're alone.
You scared the hell out of me.
Keep your fucking hands off my things.
Sorry. I didn't mean to get in your way.
Goddamn fool.
- Just like the others.
- Paul.
Annie, I was just explaining to Mr...
Look, we don't want to bother anyone.
We were just looking around.
You see, I used to live here.
I'm with her.
And I thought I'd met all your relatives.
No, no, no! Annie, what are we looking for here?
- Something happened to Ethan that night.
- He found your father.
But it's more than that. Follow me.
This... was my bedroom.
Oh, this is nice.
See?
You got the room with the view.
Those were the old slave quarters. Ethan and I were never allowed to play there.
It happened in there.
- My God, are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Let's just get outta here, Annie.
- I'll be right back.
Hey! What are you doing?
Goddammit.
Hey, come on, guys.
Come on.
Would you relax?
Let's go.
Annie, I really wish you'd take the day off.
Right now, those kids are the only thing that's keeping me sane.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
- I'll see you later.
- OK.
Guys, what's going on here?
Cut this out and stop fighting.
Boys... Liz, what's his name?
Stop this! Why are you doing this?
Drew, Matt, stop it!
- We were making masks...
- I'll take over from here.
Wait a second. Stop it.
What is the problem?
Matthew! Drew! Now stop it!
- What is going on?
- He started it.
- Liar.
- He did. Look.
Matthew?
What is it?
It's the Candyman. They killed him.
Listen, guys. There's no such thing as a Candyman.
It's just a story, a really scary story. And these come from Matthew's imagination.
- But what about all the murders?
- Well...
Sometimes there are people in this world that do bad things. Horrible things.
When they don't get caught, we blame imaginary monsters for their crimes.
But that's all the Candyman is.
An imaginary monster.
But he lives in the mirror.
That's how he gets ya, from the mirror.
Five times. If you say his name five times, he's supposed to come.
You guys don't really believe that, do you?
Well, I guess I'm just gonna have to prove it, then.
Here goes.
Candyman.
Candyman.
Candyman.
Candyman.
Candyman.
You see? Nothing happened.
I can't believe you actually did that.
It was the only way
I could convince them.
And maybe yourself?
- What does that mean?
- I think you know.
What?
Are you ready for dessert?
Again?
Come on.
There are no monsters.
Shit!
Do you need any help out there?
No, no, everything is fine, Annie.
Paul?
Annie.
Annie.
I am the writing on the wall, the whisper in the classroom.
Annie,
I came for you.
Ready or not...
Paul...
We have a journey to make, you and I.
McKeever negotiates the steps, saves the dessert. What a guy!
Annie, be with me.
You're mine.
Mardi Gras... every night's like a full moon.
If you ask me, that family won the jackpot in the shit sweepstakes.
Give it a rest, Ray.
Take your time.
Anything you can remember.
It was him.
Him? Who is "him"?
He just came out of the shadows.
He had this hook that came out of his arm, and bees were crawling out of his face.
Miss Tarrant, it is Mardi Gras. Now, if you saw some kind of freak in a costume...
It wasn't a mask.
- He's real.
- Of course.
What about my brother?
There's no reason to think your husband's murder...
That's bullshit and you know it.
He's innocent.
Well, if he is, then that just leaves you, doesn't it?
Oh, Annie. Annie.
Oh, Mom. Oh, Mom.
Oh, thank heavens...
She's lyin'.
I'm here, honey.
We're almost home, honey.
Here.
- Do you think I'm crazy, too?
- Annie, don't talk like that.
Why did Daddy go to the house that night?
- What did he know?
- Annie, please. You should rest.
Did he ever talk about him?
Did he ever mention the Candyman?
Just go to sleep. That's what you need.
That's what we all need.
Today is the day, New Orleans.
It's Mardi Gras.
And time is already runnin' out.
When the clock strikes midnight, when good ol' Comus greets Rex, when the police on their horses come to sweep us out of the Quarter, it, mes amis, is histoire.
- Annie.
- No.
You brought me here.
You killed Paul.
Swallow your horror, and let it nourish you.
Come with me, and sing the song of misery.
Share my world,
Annie.
No!
Annie! It's all right. It's all right.
You were just dreamin'.
- Mother, I saw him.
- Annie, death is a return, you know.
We leave life just like we came in.
Alone?
Naked, blind, and covered in our own shit.
Oh, no, but not me.
I'm goin' in my prom dress.
The Lord knows it fits again.
You rest. I'll get that.
I don't care what they say.
Tell them she's ill. Tell them they should be in school, for God's sake.
Who is it?
It's no one, Annie. Why don't you just go back up to bed?
Send them up.
Here?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second.
Now, tell me exactly what happened.
- All we know is that Matthew's gone.
- He disappeared last night.
- The cops have been talkin' to everyone.
- They don't know a thing, but, what if?
Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
Now you makin' me proud, New Orleans.
We are eatin' the meat raw.
I tell ya what. I'm not goin' home till this is over.
I'm on the air full time.
Man, somebody bring me a hurricane.
Somebody find this Kingfish a woman.
Lent starts tomorrow, mes amis, and me, I want somethin' tasty to give up.
- Who you lookin' for?
- I'm Matthew's teacher.
- I'm lookin' for his father.
- The Reverend's not seeing anyone.
- Please. I wanna help.
- Help?
We've had way too much of that already.
- Go on back to your classroom.
- You don't understand...
- We understand, all right.
- Understand what?
I always worried about him being on the street after dark, but... he didn't want his daddy taggin' along when he went to buy his paints, so...
- like a fool, I let him go alone.
- What did the police say?
The police don't give a damn.
They figure, one less drug dealer or potential murderer to worry about.
- But they don't know my son.
- Matthew has seemed withdrawn, lately.
Ever since his mother died, he's been having nightmares.
- Has he talked about them?
- No, but they must have been pretty bad.
He doesn't sleep in his room any more.
He just sits up all night, painting.
- It's the only thing that calms him.
- Can I see them? The paintings.
He calls this his studio.
Oh, Lord.
Did he ever mention the Candyman?
All the kids have heard of the stories.
But I never thought he'd believe them.
But how did it happen to Matthew?
I see it every day.
The people around here are desperate.
They have no reason for hope.
Some of 'em get sucked into the pit.
They turn to false gods.
I am not gonna let that happen to my son.
But what if it's true?
What if the Candyman does exist?
Then only God can save us.
Come on, guys, let's go home.
No, I'm gettin' this up.
- Come on. Come on, guys.
- I'm tryin' to do this.
- Come on, now, leave me alone.
- Push it.
Damn. What do you want me to do?
Bees got him.
You will all be punished.
Even you.
That's right, New Orleans, it's Mardi Gras.
It's Fat Tuesday, and I am fat.
My belt is broken, my pants are open, my belly is a mountain of love stuffed with oysters.
And y'all know what tomorrow is.
Ash Wednesday.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
I just stood there and watched Paul die.
And now Matthew.
I said his name to those kids, Ethan.
Oh, Jesus.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I wanted to protect you.
You and Mom.
But it wasn't enough.
- It'll never be enough.
- What did you see that night?
What was Daddy doing there?
He believed, Annie.
He even convinced me.
You weren't around to see how obsessed he became.
I mean, all Dad ever talked about was callin' the...
Callin' him. It got so bad,
I was afraid to leave him alone.
But, that night, he got away from me.
I knew exactly where he'd go.
He'd been goin' to the house every night.
I blew it, Annie.
- If I'd gotten there five minutes sooner...
- But why? Why did he call him?
Dad said he'd found a way to destroy him.
- What has our family got to do with this?
- I don't know.
Dad wouldn't tell me.
Before he died, he got in touch with this guy who trafficked in black market stuff.
- Stolen art, weird shit.
- What was his name?
- He won't talk to ya. I tried.
- His name.
Thibideaux. He's in the Quarter.
No, don't go. It's too dangerous.
- I must find out what Dad was looking for.
- Wait till I get out.
There isn't time.
Besides, you'll be safe here.
There's always someone watching.
- I think you've done this before.
- Oh, yeah.
- Come on, get it where it's drippin' there.
- I'm gonna try.
Would you care for something sweet?
A small snowball, please.
Cherry?
Cherry would be fine.
Sweets for the sweet.
Would you like something else?
I'm looking for a man named Thibideaux.
Well, I don't think I'm acquainted with anybody by that name.
- It's about my father.
- Maybe you should talk to your daddy.
He's dead.
He was murdered.
Coleman Tarrant.
Clara, why don't you run on ahead to that party and I'll meet you over there, OK?
I'll have you know, Honoré, I intend to collect on that drink you promised me.
Oh, yeah, baby. I'm countin' on it.
Hello.
You wait here.
I'm gonna take a look.
Your father understood the difference between history and age.
Some pieces are merely old.
Others have history.
And history, because it reflects life, is not always pretty.
It eats, it... if you'll pardon the expression... shits.
Most of the objects your father sought held history within them.
Your father found out that the Candyman was born here in New Orleans.
His name was Daniel Robitaille.
And she was his lover.
Caroline Sullivan.
Your father was almost as obsessed with her as he was with the Candyman.
Why?
There was something of hers he most desperately wanted.
Her mirror.
Those who witnessed the horror said that Robitaille's suffering was so agonizing, so unbearable, that his soul became trapped in Caroline's mirror.
And my father thought he could stop him with it.
Break the mirror, break the curse.
Where's the mirror now?
Who knows? Caroline found it next to
Robitaille's body and disappeared.
There were rumors, of course. Suicide...
Your father never believed that, though.
Let me go.
What do you want from me?
There's a life that grows inside you now.
A daughter.
You cannot change who you are.
Come on!
Shit.
You have a life that grows inside you now.
A daughter.
Oh, Paul.
Who am I?
The world is turning, brothers and sisters, fast towards tomorrow.
And I'm not the man I used to be.
I got hooves on my shoes and horns on my head.
I want life on a platter, medium rare.
And you can keep the silverware, cos tonight I'm eatin' with my hands.
Who's there?
Robitaille was born right here in New Orleans.
- I know.
- I called him in front of Matthew.
All slave births were registered here.
Daniel Robitaille.
He was born at the Esplanade Plantation.
That's my family's house.
That's where I was born.
There's more.
If what Matthew believes is true,
I hope you can stop it.
God bless you.
They had a daughter.
Officer, they told me to make a report.
Sit down over here.
Take a look. Take a good look.
- I can't keep doing this.
- Look! More of your sister's handiwork.
- No! Annie didn't do that.
- Come on, cut the bullshit!
I'm on to your sick games!
- Why do you keep sayin' this?
- You've been coverin' for her all along.
You don't know what you're talkin' about! It's him!
Who? Your friend the Candyman?
- You afraid, Tarrant?
- Let me go.
Should we call him?
- You're crazy.
- Candyman.
- Candyman.
- No, don't.
Candyman. Candyman.
- Don't.
- Candyman.
No!
No!
No!
Stop!
I said, stop!
We were just wondering if you'd seen
Mrs. Tarrant's daughter, Annie.
No, there's been no activity at all.
No!
No!
No! God, no!
- Good evening, ma'am.
- Has there been any sign of her?
No, ma'am.
Oh, Annie.
You lied to us from the beginning.
I've seen the birth certificate.
I've been to the cemetery.
No, it's not true.
It's true. Caroline bought the house because that's where he was born.
And she raised their daughter in that house. Your grandmother.
She was raised a white girl, and no one suspected the truth. But Daddy did.
So Daddy started digging.
My father was trying to stop him.
- But you just kept on lying.
- I did it to protect you.
Oh, Annie, you just wait until you have children of your own. You'll understand.
I'll never lie to my child.
Your father was tryin' to destroy everything we had
- by linkin' our name with that monster.
- So you destroyed it instead,
- by denying the truth.
- I am not a part of him!
- We're his family!
- No!
- We're his blood!
- I will not have you talk like that.
You can't wash him away with a bottle!
There is no Candyman.
He does not exist.
My child.
You doubted me... your own flesh and blood.
Death is a return, you know.
Annie...
Annie, it's almost time.
Time for our journey.
Soon we'll be together, just the way I planned.
You cannot resist what is in your blood.
Our blood.
Your baby's blood.
You can't fight what is meant to be.
The choice will be yours, Annie.
I'm so sorry.
No!
Miss Tarrant!
Go on! Quick! Go around the back there.
Annie, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Ethan's dead.
I'm sorry. He was shot trying to escape.
Detective Levesque's body was found... mutilated.
The guards assumed...
I watched the video tape of what happened in that room.
Ray's body was torn apart by somethin' powerful, and it wasn't your brother.
You better hurry before they get here.
29 minutes to go, New Orleans.
29 minutes till judgment.
So get drunk, get fatter, and get fucked.
Yeah, you're right. I said it.
Y'all can trust the Kingfish.
The heavens have just opened up on us and the banks of the Mississippi are about to burst.
I don't think they're gonna hold it back any more.
They're as full as the Kingfish's belly.
Yeah, Mardi Gras.
Where is it?
Where is it?
God damn you!
The slave quarters.
Matthew! Oh, my God!
Are you all right?
I was so worried about you.
You should go home.
I knew when you called him, he'd come.
Like before.
You were hiding here.
He's in my dreams, Annie.
- I know.
- I had to see...
I wanted to see him for real.
Matthew, I need to find the mirror.
It must be down there. Be careful.
Annie!
Go back! Get some help, Matthew!
Annie, don't.
The mirror is the secret of my strength.
The keeper of my soul.
The destiny of our family.
Annie, our journey begins.
This is why I brought you here.
I was not always this way.
This is who I've become.
You must see what they did.
My only sin was to love Caroline, and to give her a daughter.
They took everything from me, Annie.
Let me go.
My family.
Did you think you could get away from us?
My child. My life.
No!
Be my witness.
See how I became the reflection of their hatred.
Their evil.
Kill him!
See what it means to call me by that name.
Candyman.
- Candyman.
- Candyman, Candyman.
- Candyman.
- Sweets to the sweet!
My pain was unbearable.
But Caroline's was even greater.
Let him go!
Stop her!
No!
- Father!
- Caroline.
You will all be damned.
You defiled my daughter.
- Father.
- Could she even look at you now?
Candyman...
Now, do you see what was taken from me?
Yes.
No! No!
They killed me, Annie.
But they could not destroy my soul.
Join me, Annie. We will go together to a world without pain.
No more pain.
Death is only the beginning.
Your cradle will be your grave.
- Annie.
- Annie.
- Annie.
- Annie.
- Annie.
- Annie.
- Annie.
- Annie.
Annie.
- Annie!
- Annie! Annie!
Annie!
Grab my arm, Annie!
- Annie!
- Grab my hand!
Grab my hand! Come here! Grab my hand!
Go! Go!
Go!
Go!
Annie, the choice is no longer yours.
You are mine.
The cradle is your grave, not mine.
No.
Go! Let's get out of here. Go!
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Yeah, it's Lent. So y'all take it easy.
We made it through another one,
New Orleans.
And the Kingfish hope you got plenty to atone for.
Hope you all said a fond farewell to the flesh.
Hey, it's the cycle, Crescent City.
And we are startin' it again.
- Mommy, let's look at some more.
- Just a few more pages.
That's your mommy. She's pretty.
That's right.
And who's that?
That little girl is your great-grandma, Isabel.
And that's her mommy, Caroline.
That's my name, too.
- Who's that?
- That's Isabel's daddy.
And when you get a little older,
I will tell you a story about him.
- Tell me now.
- Right now, it's time for your nap.
Candyman, Candyman,
Candyman, Candyman,
- Cand...
- Caroline!
Go to sleep.

{6642}{6714}Captain, my crates.|Have you loaded my crates?
{6717}{6759}They can't go.|They have to come off.
{6762}{6822}- Who the hell are you?|- My name is John Whitney.
{6825}{6898}The crates, they're consigned|to the Natural History Museum in Chicago.
{6901}{6966}- Just tell me if they're onboard.|- Crates is all we have onboard, senor.
{6969}{7058}No, they have to come off.|This is extremely important.
{7061}{7127}Nothing comes off after customs|has been on, senor.
{7130}{7226}- That's more important.|- Look. Look, I'll take care of you, all right?
{7229}{7323}If you'll just get the manifest.|The Natural History Museum in Chicago.
{7326}{7377}- Please, compadre.|- I don't have time for this.
{7380}{7452}I have to get my ship out of the harbor.|I'm eight hours late,
{7455}{7489}and there's weather coming in.
{7492}{7566}Don't worry, senor.|We'll take good care of your crates.
{10405}{10485}6 WEEKS LATER
{11030}{11085}Morning, Lieutenant.|Coast Guard found it early this morning.
{11088}{11181}Don't really know how long it's been there|or how it got there.
{11184}{11231}- What are those?|- The old coal tunnels.
{11234}{11328}There was a time when 30 coal barges a day|would come into this slip.
{11331}{11382}I'm touched.|Who the hell is onboard?
{11385}{11449}- Hollingsworth.|- Wonderful.
{11481}{11554}Morning, Lieutenant.|Just been to the front of the boat.
{11557}{11595}I got something to show you.
{11598}{11717}It's a ship, Hollingsworth, not a boat.|And the pointy end is the bow.
{11720}{11786}Custody hearing went badly?
{11789}{11826}I don't want to talk about it.
{11829}{11882}She got Jerry?
{11897}{11981}What part of "I don't want to talk about it"|is unclear?
{11984}{12084}- Oh, shit.|- His ex-wife got custody of his son?
{12089}{12147}- His dog.|- His dog?
{12150}{12221}Yeah, he really loves that dog.
{12253}{12349}The ship's registered out of Brazil.|Came down through the seaway.
{12352}{12412}Paperwork looks legit.
{12509}{12604}It's blood.|Lab's checking it for type.
{12638}{12720}- Any bodies?|- Nope. Not a one.
{12725}{12755}When the Coast Guard found it,
{12758}{12803}it was floundering|in the middle of Lake Michigan.
{12806}{12886}So they towed it in, and nobody knows|how long it had been like that.
{12889}{12950}- You checked the manifest?|- We're doing it now.
{12953}{13046}- Bring in the dogs?|- The drug unit's been over the whole thing.
{13049}{13146}I told them it was a waste of time.|I mean, this was obviously a drug hit.
{13149}{13223}Whatever they came for, they found.
{13226}{13325}Now, I figure they came aboard at night,|they killed everyone,
{13328}{13381}and they threw the bodies overboard.
{13384}{13452}You figured all that out by yourself?
{13455}{13527}- Holy shit!|- What?
{13530}{13602}- What?|- Cat. Nearly gave me a heart attack.
{13605}{13680}- Was it a black cat?|- No.
{13756}{13812}What's that smell?
{13851}{13913}- Is the bilge below here?|- I think so.
{13916}{13959}Give me that.
{13965}{14024}Give me a hand here.
{14035}{14086}What a stink!
{14284}{14337}Jesus Christ.
{14741}{14799}1 WEEK LATER|- Let's all stay together.
{14802}{14914}Please walk! Walk!|Walk, children. Walk!
{14917}{15034}Walk. Please, walk. Walk.|Let's all stay together.
{15037}{15087}- I say we go.|- Wait a minute. Let me get this straight.
{15090}{15152}We finally cut school|and you wanna go to a museum.
{15155}{15198}Maybe afterwards we could go to a library.
{15201}{15279}They've got mummies in there,|eyeballs in jars, dead stuff.
{15282}{15326}See, man, I don't know about this stuff.
{15329}{15423}Look, we can go in with them,|check it out, split.
{15426}{15486}I mean, we can't go|to an arcade yet anyway.
{15489}{15519}We'd be noticed.
{15522}{15612}- So, what are you, scared?|- No, I'm not scared!
{15909}{15959}Hey, didn't your parents teach you|not to stare?
{15962}{16022}Didn't yours teach you|not to get dressed in the street?
{16025}{16086}- Good morning, Dr. Green.|- Good morning.
{16089}{16146}- Doctor?|- What kind of a doctor are you?
{16149}{16213}I'm an evolutionary biologist.
{16216}{16240}What's that?
{16243}{16314}Someone trying to figure out|where our tails went.
{16317}{16358}Your teacher's|gonna be looking for you.
{16361}{16425}Oh, yeah. Come on, Eugene.
{16432}{16591}Kids, do not run. Walk. Walk. Easy.|Do not run, walk.
{16612}{16701}Walk, kids. Walk.
{16740}{16775}- Walk.|- Good morning, Dr. Green.
{16778}{16830}- Good morning, Fred.|- These kids are driving me crazy.
{16833}{16916}Careful.|They're our future benefactors.
{16981}{17056}Margo, I need to speak with you|about your grant.
{17059}{17126}- You've heard already?|- I've heard something.
{17129}{17193}- I didn't get it.|- No. It's not that bad.
{17196}{17300}It's just that the Blaisedale Foundation|has decided to delay their decision.
{17303}{17447}- Delay? Why?|- Greg Lee is applying for the same grant.
{17450}{17493}Greg?
{17513}{17593}- I thought he had his grant.|- Well, he's going after another one.
{17596}{17657}Can he do that? Another one?
{17660}{17729}I mean, doesn't he realize|that I have to shut down my work
{17732}{17838}- if I don't get that money?|- I don't suppose he's thought about that.
{17841}{17908}- Slimy bastard.|- Margo, have a little faith in yourself.
{17911}{17975}- You're better than he is.|- Faith?
{17978}{18063}Come on. It's not the end of the world.|It's just a little competition.
{18066}{18123}You've got the gala coming up|night after next,
{18126}{18174}and the Blaisedales|are going to be here.
{18177}{18226}- You know? The Blaisedales.|- Yes.
{18229}{18294}So put on your party dress,|and I'll introduce you,
{18297}{18378}and you show them|just how bright you are.
{18381}{18444}I just want to do my work.
{18448}{18500}You know, Greg will be there,
{18503}{18602}attaching himself to the Blaisedales|like a crustacean.
{18724}{18780}Donna, did you get the gecko|and lizard samples loaded?
{18783}{18839}It's through the replicator.|We got a big sample.
{18842}{18909}Great. Hey, Charlie.|Did we get the database back online?
{18912}{18974}It's online, but I don't know|for how long. - Good.
{18977}{19065}- Hello, Greg. How nice to see you!|- Margo.
{19069}{19152}- How's the old research going?|- Fine. I'm just a little bit busy.
{19155}{19224}Could there be anything special|that you'd like to tell me?
{19227}{19307}Of course not. 'Cause if there was,|you would've just come out and told me.
{19310}{19359}I have every right to apply|for any grant.
{19362}{19446}So you go behind my back|and apply for my grant?
{19449}{19534}- There's nothing wrong with that.|- It's not your grant until you get it.
{19537}{19638}If I don't get it, I'm out of work.|My staff is out of work.
{19641}{19751}- You shouldn't take it so personally.|- You really are a gerbil.
{20407}{20479}Margo. Well, this is a surprise.
{20482}{20558}- I was just... I thought...|- I asked Margo to join us, Ann.
{20561}{20628}- I hope you don't mind.|- Oh, no. Of course not.
{20631}{20700}No word from John yet,|but these crates arrived this morning.
{20703}{20811}They were supposed to be on a ship|except there was some mix-up in Brazil,
{20814}{20878}and they never made it.|They were sent by air freight.
{20881}{20931}Here, here. Take a look at this.
{20934}{21006}- The Kothoga.|- Could be.
{21009}{21048}And what does this god|specialize in?
{21051}{21150}South American tribe, the Zenzera,|long thought to be extinct.
{21153}{21248}They made a deal with satan|to vanquish their enemies.
{21251}{21353}So, Kothoga was born, son of satan.|You have that look again, Margo.
{21356}{21418}Why do we keep financing|John Whitney's expeditions,
{21421}{21466}as if superstition|were the same thing as science?
{21469}{21564}Anthropologists are permitted|to believe in myth. It's part of their job.
{21567}{21677}In any case, our superstition exhibit|is excellent box office for this museum,
{21680}{21718}and that benefits you, as well.
{21721}{21783}Using superstition|to bring people to the museum
{21786}{21863}is like hiring topless ushers|for the Bolshoi Ballet.
{21866}{21915}Well, if they did,|I might go to the ballet.
{21918}{21991}Do you really think the restoration|department can do something with this?
{21994}{22054}Certainly.|Possibly even for the opening.
{22057}{22085}What was in this other crate?
{22088}{22143}Except for the packing leaves,|it was empty.
{22146}{22243}Empty? Well, was there a packing list?|There must've been something in here.
{22246}{22330}Crates were nailed shut|when they arrived.
{22403}{22458}- Strange.|- What?
{22478}{22543}Do you think these are eggs?
{22546}{22683}More like fungus. Probably parasitical.|Best not to take any chances.
{22686}{22804}Quite right. Let's see to having those leaves|and crates incinerated.
{22987}{23051}Of course you can, Margo.
{23291}{23432}Attention, please. The museum|will be closing in 15 minutes. Thank you.
{23832}{23883}Hey, man, this stuff is so cool.
{23886}{24008}- I don't think we're supposed to be here.|- Don't be such a wuss, Eugene.
{24012}{24107}Attention, please.|The museum is now closed.
{24125}{24225}Attention, please.|The museum is now closed.
{24228}{24274}We're gonna get in big trouble.
{24277}{24363}What do you think they're gonna do?|Put us in the museum jail?
{25503}{25588}Johnson? Davis? That you?
{26711}{26790}Dr. Green,|I've worked myself to the bone.
{26793}{26890}Please let me go home.|I need to rest.
{26961}{27042}All right, you guys.|You can finish tomorrow morning.
{27045}{27103}Go on. Take a hike.
{27270}{27392}Why don't we just start yelling?|Someone will show us the way out of here.
{27424}{27529}And call our moms and let them know|that we cut class.
{27532}{27592}Great idea, butt wipe.
{27669}{27710}Hey, man, there's a really cool|staircase back here.
{27713}{27820}- No, let's just get out of here.|- What are you, scared?
{28458}{28530}Hello? Is someone there?
{28723}{28832}Josh? Josh, where are you?
{28873}{28916}Josh.
{28954}{29025}Josh, come on. This isn't funny.
{29197}{29289}- You goofball. You almost wet your pants.|- Josh.
{29355}{29418}Quiet. Do you hear something?
{29421}{29487}- What is it?|- I don't know.
{29547}{29607}- Let's just go.|- Yeah.
{29629}{29706}- You smell something?|- You farted, didn't you?
{29709}{29762}No, not lately.
{29965}{30027}Let's get out of here.
{30431}{30486}That's terrific.
{30518}{30558}Hang on to your fucking hat,|Lieutenant.
{30561}{30630}I want to interview every employee|whether they worked yesterday or not.
{30633}{30700}If they did work, I want the hours,|what part of the building,
{30703}{30757}if they saw the victim,|what time and where.
{30760}{30814}Who was the last person|to leave the building yesterday?
{30817}{30917}- A Dr. Green.|- Good. I want to talk to him.
{30961}{31010}- Did you hear?|- No.
{31013}{31117}- I'm guessing you're gonna tell me.|- Someone's been killed.
{31161}{31219}- Murder.|- Oh, my god.
{31222}{31316}They're not telling us who. All I know is|they cut off the whole basement level.
{31319}{31345}Murdered?
{31348}{31441}I'm betting it was Colonel Mustard|with a candlestick.
{31470}{31592}What? What are you thinking?|You think I'm an asshole, right? Is that it?
{31596}{31646}- Are you Dr. Green?|- Yes, I am.
{31649}{31704}Could you come with me, please?
{31707}{31758}- It's okay, honey.|- I understand...
{31761}{31837}- It's gonna be all right.|- All right, that's good. All right.
{31840}{31907}Take them both to the 15th.|I want detailed statements
{31910}{31953}in the presence of a psychologist.
{31956}{32003}Museum security wants to know|if they can open the doors.
{32006}{32054}No. Check to see|if they got anything on video.
{32057}{32104}I did that, sir. They don't have|surveillance cameras down here.
{32107}{32179}- Can I help you?|- Lieutenant D'Agosta wants to see me.
{32182}{32250}- He does?|- This is Dr. Green.
{32253}{32326}Yeah. Dr. Green, I'm Lieutenant D'Agosta.|I wanted to ask you some questions,
{32329}{32388}but I'm fresh on the scene here.|Can I find you later?
{32391}{32427}- Can I go to my lab?|- Not yet.
{32430}{32486}We'll clear the work areas|as soon as we can.
{32489}{32582}- What am I supposed to do?|- Enjoying your mochas, gentlemen?
{32585}{32636}- The smell!|- Take it outside, Martini.
{32639}{32693}I'm okay. I'm okay.
{32937}{33009}- This look familiar to you?|- Yep.
{33050}{33098}This is not good.
{33101}{33166}Never thought there was a worse way to die|than a shark attack.
{33169}{33229}Having my head ripped off|never occurred to me.
{33232}{33285}- Where is his head?|- It's over there by the sink.
{33288}{33368}Lieutenant D'Agosta...|Oh, my god!
{33380}{33437}Get her out of here.
{33447}{33508}Lieutenant, over here.
{33512}{33624}No, don't step over it.|It's bad luck.
{33635}{33669}Jesus Christ.
{33672}{33724}There's a half-burnt joint|on the floor.
{33727}{33808}Seems our boy was having|a little pot on the potty.
{33822}{33922}Pot's a misdemeanor.|Decapitation seems a bit severe.
{33981}{34076}I want the blood on the walls.|Get a ballistic analysis.
{34079}{34188}Pinpoint source, speed, force,|full splatter pattern.
{34272}{34328}Sweep in teams of two.|Nobody goes in alone.
{34331}{34440}This place is not gonna open|until every room is clear. Now, go.
{34469}{34532}Now, the question is,|what does a museum guard
{34535}{34606}have to do with a drug hit|on a South American ship?
{34609}{34689}- I don't know.|- The answer is, maybe nothing.
{34813}{34942}Dr. Cuthbert. Lieutenant|Vincent D'Agosta, Chicago homicide.
{34945}{35018}Lieutenant, this is Tom Parkinson,|our director of security.
{35021}{35077}Have you identified the victim,|Lieutenant Augustino?
{35080}{35115}D'Agosta.
{35118}{35164}Victim's name is Frederick Ford.
{35167}{35247}Freddy Ford?|What a terrible, terrible thing.
{35250}{35315}Yeah. I'd say somebody was|really pissed off at him.
{35318}{35349}Any thoughts on who that might be?
{35352}{35416}No. He was a very sweet man.|I have no idea.
{35419}{35443}I hardly knew the guy.
{35446}{35539}Lieutenant, I don't mean to downplay|the horror of this tragedy
{35542}{35630}or the urgency of your investigation,|but what about the museum?
{35633}{35669}I'm going to do this in layers.
{35672}{35729}You'll be allowed in your offices|once we've been through the building
{35732}{35769}and determined|that there is no danger.
{35772}{35828}But what about our exhibition space?|When will that open?
{35831}{35897}We have a major exhibit|about to open.
{35900}{35980}The board is hosting a gala preview|here tomorrow night.
{35983}{36043}It's so vital to us.
{36049}{36091}I can't tell you exactly when.
{36094}{36164}Lieutenant,|we've invested so much in this.
{36167}{36243}It would be a disaster for us|if we had to postpone.
{36246}{36338}We're checking your offices and labs first|so you people can go back, do your work.
{36341}{36423}It won't take long. Now,|as far as the areas open to the public,
{36426}{36452}we may have somebody|on our hands
{36455}{36515}who makes Jeffery Dahmer|look like a Cub Scout,
{36518}{36596}and I've got to be sure|he's not here.
{36994}{37101}Dr. Green.|I'd like to ask you a few questions.
{37118}{37161}Okay.
{37193}{37261}- What's that stuff you were looking at?|- DNA strands.
{37264}{37321}Did you come all the way down here|to learn about DNA?
{37324}{37355}No.
{37358}{37423}I hope you don't mind walking.|I have to return these samples.
{37426}{37477}Well, if I get tired,|I'll let you know.
{37480}{37566}- What's the soup today?|- Rhinoceros megarhinus.
{37569}{37630}He's making rhinoceros soup?
{37633}{37714}It's a maceration tank.|Skin them, toss them in the warm water,
{37717}{37782}wait until the meat and flesh fall off,|and then give them to the beetles.
{37785}{37833}Beetles as in bug beetles?
{37845}{37900}Domestic beetles are|a fairly common insect.
{37903}{37974}They eat the flesh off almost anything.|They pick the bones clean.
{37977}{38034}Better watch yourself.|Someone left the glass case open last night
{38037}{38061}and a bunch hit the highway.
{38064}{38107}Well, they know better|than to head for the cafeteria.
{38110}{38208}I'm sorry you had to see all that|at the crime scene.
{38212}{38278}I said hello to that man every day|for the past six years.
{38281}{38349}You could have closed the door.
{38352}{38418}- Did you know him well?|- No.
{38459}{38501}Wait.
{38508}{38580}- Is it face up?|- Down.
{38583}{38634}Don't touch it.|Face down's bad luck.
{38637}{38704}Don't tell me|you're superstitious.
{38707}{38792}Sorry, but around here,|every penny counts.
{38821}{38851}What the hell's all this?
{38854}{38920}This is one of six storage areas|for the collection.
{38923}{39006}The museum has something|like 3 million specimens.
{39009}{39083}Exhibition areas only show about 2%|of what the museum owns.
{39086}{39154}It doesn't look like a good place|to light a match.
{39157}{39257}According to museum security,|you were the last one to leave last night.
{39260}{39361}- Did you see or hear anything strange?|- No.
{39364}{39407}Well, I thought I heard something|as I was leaving,
{39410}{39473}but it could have been anything.|I was tired.
{39476}{39535}What can you tell me about John Whitney?|You know him?
{39538}{39643}- Unfortunately.|- His office was vandalized last night.
{39680}{39720}Sir.
{39783}{39819}Do you have any idea|what might have been in this office
{39822}{39858}that someone would want|so damn bad?
{39861}{39931}I have no idea why anyone would want|anything of John Whitney's.
{39934}{39986}But I've been told|mine's a subjective opinion.
{39989}{40056}You ever see John Whitney with Fred Ford?|Were they friends?
{40059}{40099}No.
{40104}{40203}- Does John Whitney use or sell drugs?|- I don't think so.
{40206}{40324}John Whitney's not in Brazil|shipping drugs, just insignificant relics.
{40337}{40408}- Brazil?|- Yeah, a couple of crates came in yesterday.
{40411}{40451}- What was in them?|- One had a smashed relic.
{40454}{40488}The other was empty.
{40491}{40550}- So there was nothing inside?|- That's what empty means.
{40553}{40605}- Could it have been pried open?|- It was nailed shut.
{40608}{40646}Could it have been pried open|and then nailed shut?
{40649}{40722}I suppose so. What are you suggesting?|That there were drugs in the crate?
{40725}{40799}I don't suggest.|Where are those crates?
{40802}{40897}They were burned, but the relic's|in the restoration department.
{40997}{41070}Perri Masai, our restorative genius,|Lieutenant D'Agosta.
{41073}{41095}Hi.
{41098}{41184}Well, this is John Whitney's relic|or what's left of it.
{41187}{41255}- Any idea what it looks like?|- With black stone, it's difficult.
{41258}{41302}It's a chimera of some kind.
{41305}{41369}- What's a chimera?|- It's a combination of creatures
{41372}{41468}that superstitious people|see as god or enemy.
{41473}{41544}What kind of superstitious people?
{41618}{41678}Here's my card.|If you think of anything else...
{41681}{41733}You're welcome.
{41837}{41892}Lieutenant D'Agosta,
{41895}{42014}it's lovely to see you|under such alarming circumstances.
{42018}{42097}Seven decapitations in one week.
{42100}{42175}Don't you just hate someone|who only takes head and never gives it?
{42178}{42220}You're bad, Matilda, real bad.
{42223}{42326}Autopsy attended by Lieutenant Vincent|D'Agosta, Chicago homicide.
{42329}{42422}- I heard your ex got custody of the dog.|- What, it's on the goddamn Internet?
{42425}{42520}You shouldn't have been late|on your Alpo payments.
{42543}{42645}We have an African American male,|probably age 55 to 60.
{42648}{42740}Height, 5'4",|with his head, maybe 6'1".
{42743}{42838}Weight, 160, give or take,|if you know what I mean.
{42841}{42894}There are an undetermined|number of lacerations
{42897}{42987}preceding from the left anterior pectoral|region downward through the sternum,
{42990}{43066}terminating at the right|anterior abdominal region.
{43069}{43157}The pectoralis minor and pectoralis major|are separated to a great degree.
{43160}{43202}And there is|spontaneous dehiscence.
{43205}{43308}The sternal process has been split|and the rib cage exposed.
{43311}{43398}Now for the head.|The head is decapitated
{43401}{43468}between the axial process|and the atlas.
{43471}{43554}The entire occipital portion|of the calvarium
{43557}{43615}and half the parietal process|has been crushed
{43618}{43700}or rather seemingly punched through|and removed,
{43703}{43786}leaving a hole perhaps|5 inches in diameter.
{43789}{43884}The skull is empty.|The entire brain appears to have fallen out
{43887}{43950}or been extracted|through this hole.
{43953}{44056}- Any idea about a weapon?|- Something big.
{44089}{44133}The brain is severely traumatized
{44136}{44208}and appears to have been severed|at the medulla oblongata.
{44211}{44262}The pons Varolii|is intact but separate.
{44265}{44352}The cerebrum has been completely severed|from the mesencephalon.
{44355}{44497}And... Wait a minute,|this brain's light, even for a man.
{44508}{44578}Something's missing, Lieutenant.|Where's the rest of it?
{44581}{44682}- You got everything we found.|- There is no thalamic region.
{44685}{44779}- There is no pituitary gland.|- What are you talking about?
{44782}{44892}The thalamus and hypothalamus|regulate body temperature, blood pressure,
{44895}{45002}heartbeat, it regulates hundreds|of hormones into the bloodstream.
{45005}{45070}- Don't you agree, Fred?|- Yes.
{45073}{45128}He never shuts up.
{45589}{45636}That was fast.
{45755}{45860}Glycotetraline collagenoid,|Weinstein's thyrotropic hormone.
{45863}{46001}Tenascin, oxytocin, monoxytocin,|suppressive hormones.
{46004}{46091}This fungus is loaded with hormones,|animal hormones.
{46094}{46157}What kind of fungus is this?
{46473}{46550}Hollingsworth, I hope|I'm interrupting your dinner.
{46553}{46646}Listen, dig up whatever records|we have on those bodies from the ship.
{46649}{46678}If there were any autopsies done,
{46681}{46767}check and see if any part of the brain|was missing from any of the heads.
{46770}{46882}I don't care how long it takes.|Let me ask you something.
{46896}{46976}How the fuck does somebody|get custody of a dog?
{47079}{47131}- Good night.|- Good night, ma'am.
{52755}{52852}- Morning, Lieutenant.|- Pretty fancy.
{52855}{52934}It only took|seven months planning.
{52937}{53015}I really hope|you can have your party tonight.
{53018}{53058}So do I.
{53061}{53126}We may have a majorly crazy person|somewhere in this building
{53129}{53194}and I don't think you'd want him|showing up tonight.
{53197}{53259}No, we can't have that.
{53302}{53378}- This is a big deal, isn't it?|- Very big.
{53381}{53482}- This party will raise a lot of money, right?|- A lot of money. Very high profile.
{53485}{53570}The Mayor is coming, the media,|big companies that give lots of grants,
{53573}{53652}- limousines, the whole schmeer.|- Tell you what, we'll find this guy
{53655}{53691}so you can have your party.
{53694}{53795}Lieutenant, do you like smoked salmon|on those little round toasty things?
{53798}{53871}- I don't think I've ever had it.|- Well, if you don't catch your man,
{53874}{53960}there's going to be|about 300 pounds of it.
{54141}{54212}Yeah, but have you tried|the lattes with the whole milk?
{54215}{54313}- Very smooth.|- I like espresso. Forget smooth.
{54316}{54378}- What the fuck do you know?|- I know I like espresso.
{54381}{54455}- Yeah, but have you tried lattes?|- No.
{54458}{54545}There's supposed to be a door|around here someplace.
{54607}{54668}Here it is. Here it is.
{54766}{54809}Jesus.
{54940}{55031}Come out, come out,|wherever you are.
{55044}{55119}I don't know|where the hell we are.
{55136}{55224}Maybe I'm reading this map wrong,|I don't know.
{55244}{55296}Look at this!
{55310}{55338}Jesus.
{55341}{55387}Is that a footprint?
{55475}{55576}- He's got to be over 7 feet tall.|- Looks like blood.
{55600}{55657}I think it is blood.
{55913}{55985}Good morning, Lieutenant.|How are you today?
{55988}{56060}- What have you got?|- Right.
{56085}{56206}- Well, we checked on that hypo...|- Hypothalamus.
{56209}{56309}Right. Anyway,|what heads we were able
{56312}{56407}to salvage from the Santos Morales|were pretty decomposed.
{56412}{56531}But they were all missing|their hypothalamuses.
{56569}{56637}Why thank you, Hollingsworth.
{57405}{57483}It's the consistent repetition|of sequences of three
{57486}{57583}that are unique to each individual.|But before you begin DNA testing,
{57586}{57647}you have to be able|to identify the specimen.
{57650}{57702}With your financial grant,
{57705}{57814}the complicated, tedious task|of specimen identification
{57817}{57928}will become a quick,|certain, analytical technique.
{57985}{58097}Procedure. Mode? System.
{58127}{58208}Just give me the goddamn money.|Shit.
{58289}{58358}One of the kids i n your lab told me|where to find you.
{58375}{58460}Well, I was just rehearsing.
{58463}{58544}- You were really good.|- Yeah. Right.
{58598}{58656}Really good ending.
{58668}{58719}Hold on.
{58744}{58860}- So, what's your field exactly? Biology?|- Evolutionary biology.
{58863}{58940}- Are we still evolving?|- Some of us.
{58944}{59036}Look, Lieutenant, I'm really busy right now,|and I don't have time to be socializing,
{59039}{59122}- so if you don't mind.|- I'm not here to ask you out, Dr. Green.
{59125}{59151}I just thought|there might be something else
{59154}{59239}you could tell me|about John Whitney's work.
{59263}{59318}Well, I'll take you to|Dr. Frock, our curator.
{59321}{59399}He could probably explain John Whitney|better than I can.
{59429}{59517}- It's Margo.|- Who have you brought me?
{59520}{59558}A policeman. Lieutenant D'Agosta.
{59561}{59683}Well, how goes the gradual extinction|of the human race, Lieutenant?
{59686}{59752}I'm doing what I can|to keep it orderly.
{59755}{59842}You and the lieutenant are kindred spirits.|He's very superstitious.
{59845}{59929}- I don't know about "very".|- Well, you must excuse Margo, Lieutenant.
{59932}{59994}She believes that science|must destroy myth,
{59997}{60109}and as a consequence, she has very little|patience with superstitious people like us.
{60112}{60183}Margo, did I ever tell you|about my experiences
{60186}{60235}with the Khoe tribe|in Botswana land?
{60238}{60320}- Yes, more than once.|- Haven't told him.
{60330}{60462}The Khoe tribe, Lieutenant, believed|that headaches were caused by sorcery
{60468}{60566}and the pin poke of the headache victim|would identify the sorcerer,
{60569}{60612}and then go off and murder him.
{60615}{60724}Of course, the kinfolk of the sorcerer|would feel they had to avenge his death,
{60727}{60781}so they'd go and in turn|kill the headache victim.
{60784}{60858}And I'm sure you can imagine|how it eventually all turned out.
{60861}{60908}- What's that?|- Well, it's a medical miracle.
{60911}{60987}Everybody stopped having headaches.
{61001}{61054}Lieutenant, what would|a superstitious police officer
{61057}{61110}possibly want|with an old fossil like me?
{61113}{61175}- He wants to know about John Whitney.|- You think there's some connection
{61178}{61242}between the vandalism|in John's office and the murder?
{61245}{61305}Maybe. What's John Whitney|doing in Brazil?
{61308}{61390}Well, John's an anthropologist.|He's in Brazil studying ancient tribes,
{61393}{61476}their rituals, their environmental|and social relations, their culture.
{61479}{61520}When was the last time|you heard from him?
{61523}{61574}I haven't had actual contact with him|for months,
{61577}{61645}but just yesterday,|we received a wonderful artifact.
{61648}{61705}Yeah. I took a look at it.
{61708}{61753}That artifact's rather important|to me, Lieutenant,
{61756}{61824}because it may help to illuminate|a scientific theory
{61827}{61874}I've been expounding|for some time.
{61877}{61930}- The Callisto Effect.|- What's that?
{61933}{62054}It's a commonly-held belief that life evolved|gradually by natural selection.
{62057}{62146}Dr. Frock argues that sometimes|there are sudden evolutionary changes
{62149}{62261}that create a grotesque|and short-lived aberrant species.
{62264}{62374}Okay, so, John Whitney's down in Brazil|studying ancient tribal rituals.
{62377}{62458}Could any of these rituals|have anything to do with, say,
{62461}{62526}ripping out|the human hypothalamus?
{62529}{62617}- I beg your pardon?|- Human hypothalamus?
{62713}{62754}Never mind.
{62791}{62832}You smell that?
{62835}{62927}It's that same stink|from where they found that guard.
{62930}{62981}Better get some backup down here.
{62984}{63046}2-4, 2-4, this is 2-6, you copy?
{63049}{63110}Shit!|We're under too much concrete.
{63132}{63192}What the fuck was that?
{63195}{63284}- Was that in front of us?|- It's hard to tell.
{64352}{64446}The guy was a convicted rapist.|He's a suspect in a couple of murders,
{64449}{64480}two terms of hard time,
{64483}{64538}and he fits the description|given to us by the two boys.
{64541}{64594}Those kids didn't see him|commit the murder.
{64597}{64650}Lieutenant, come on.|This place, it could've been anything.
{64653}{64698}He attacked McNally|with a fucking ax.
{64701}{64747}You know, you wanna take|somebody's head off,
{64750}{64845}- an ax is a pretty good way to do it.|- I know. I know, I know, I know, I know.
{64848}{64922}- So what's the matter?|- Something's not right.
{64925}{64956}- What's not right?|- Something.
{64959}{64991}Something what?
{64994}{65038}You're a pain in the ass,|you know that?
{65041}{65112}Here comes the rent-a-cop.
{65249}{65336}Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
{65364}{65430}- Can I get a little help here?|- Congratulations, Lieutenant.
{65433}{65495}- Looks like you've got your man.|- Maybe.
{65498}{65542}- Maybe?|- Maybe.
{65545}{65636}The man was covered in the dead guard's|blood. He was carrying his wallet.
{65639}{65697}He tried to cut his head off|with an ax.
{65700}{65775}- What do you need? A videotape?|- That'd help.
{65778}{65846}- This is nuts.|- Something's wrong.
{65849}{65894}We got a homeless ex-con|who gets his jollies
{65897}{65942}from ripping out|people's hypothalamuses?
{65945}{66002}What's he doing?|Starting a hypothalamus collection?
{66005}{66087}This guy gets on a boat sailing from Brazil,|he kills everyone onboard,
{66090}{66130}then he catches a cab|to the museum,
{66133}{66175}where he hides in the closet|in the sub-basement.
{66178}{66258}I don't know anything|about boats from Brazil,
{66261}{66331}but it's obvious to me|that this man killed Frederick Ford.
{66334}{66428}Two plus two, Lieutenant,|in my book, that's four.
{66431}{66480}You have to|let the gala go on tonight.
{66483}{66565}I don't have to|let anything go on tonight.
{66672}{66709}Asshole.
{66712}{66780}- Lieutenant.|- What's this?
{66783}{66855}We found this|under the guy's bed.
{66865}{66936}Jaime Martinez.
{66939}{67040}He was one of the victims|on the Santos Morales.
{67045}{67105}- Shit.|- This has got to be our guy.
{67108}{67208}- Lieutenant, it's for you.|- Who is it?
{67360}{67414}- Hello?|- This is Mayor Owen.
{67417}{67458}What's your first name, Lieutenant?
{67461}{67497}- Vincent.|- May I call you Vincent?
{67500}{67523}- Sure.|- Good.
{67526}{67558}You can call me Your Honor.
{67561}{67629}Tell you what, Vincent.|Looking forward to this gala tonight.
{67632}{67714}My wife is, too. She bought a killer dress|that shows off her cleavage.
{67717}{67772}Have you ever seen my wife's cleavage?|It's in all the papers.
{67775}{67809}I can't say that I have,|Your Honor.
{67812}{67890}Well, you're one of the few people|in the city of Chicago who hasn't.
{67893}{67937}That cleavage helped get me elected.
{67943}{67977}I'll bet you don't know what to say.
{67980}{68004}No, sir, I don't.
{68007}{68069}So the thing is, Vincent,|this gala tonight is very important.
{68072}{68126}It's important to the museum,|it's important to my wife,
{68129}{68258}it's important to the city, and it's real|important to Mr. and Mrs. Blaisedale.
{68261}{68292}- You know who they are?|- No.
{68295}{68360}Well, they're good friends of mine,|real good friends.
{68363}{68403}They're good friends of the city.
{68406}{68433}Real good friends.
{68436}{68499}I was so upset when I thought|they would be disappointed tonight
{68502}{68571}until I heard the wonderful news|that you caught that murderer.
{68574}{68675}Terrible business. Anyway, I called|to congratulate you on a job well done.
{68678}{68730}I'm so happy we'll be having|that gala tonight.
{68733}{68782}I'm gonna call the chief and tell him|just how happy I am.
{68785}{68824}Nice talking to you, Vincent.
{69000}{69072}I'm going to clear the wings|of museum personnel
{69075}{69158}and open only the|central exhibition area.
{69161}{69238}And I'm going to maintain|police presence throughout.
{69241}{69300}How much police presence?
{69309}{69400}As much as I goddamn|deem necessary.
{69488}{69519}- Tell Bert...|- What?
{69522}{69582}I want to make a final sweep|while the wings are still closed.
{69585}{69619}Get me a team of dogs.
{69622}{69710}But we already swept with dogs, Lieutenant,|right after we found the body.
{69713}{69791}So get better dogs. I'll take them down|myself, and you're coming with me.
{71443}{71548}Dermestes vulpinus.|That's the dermestid beetle.
{71562}{71680}Match with 33%|Hemidactylus turcicus.
{71696}{71790}Hemidactylus turcicus?|What the hell is that?
{71793}{71826}Have you seen Greg?
{71829}{71878}- He's down there.|- Thanks.
{71881}{71976}Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. Blaisedale.|How wonderful you look this evening.
{71979}{72037}I'm Greg Lee.
{72048}{72166}I'm Greg Lee, Mr. Blaisedale.|How rich you look this evening.
{72169}{72253}Good evening, Mr. Blaisedale.|I didn't know you have a daughter.
{72256}{72317}Excuse me, I don't mean to interrupt|your little meeting.
{72320}{72379}- You not going to the party?|- I'm going.
{72382}{72446}Don't get your|greedy little hopes up.
{72449}{72499}Can you identify these species?
{72502}{72537}Now you want my help?
{72540}{72616}Look, can you|identify them or not?
{72664}{72743}Hemidactylus turcicus.|That's a Turkish gecko.
{72746}{72778}- Gecko?|- Yeah, a lizard.
{72781}{72833}Yes, I know what a gecko is.
{72836}{72902}But reptilian and beetle DNA|on the same strand?
{72905}{72938}Well, maybe your source|is contaminated.
{72941}{72994}It's not contaminated.|I scraped the cells myself.
{72997}{73028}Then it's your software.
{73031}{73161}Of course, I'd be shocked to think|that it may not be 100% accurate.
{73164}{73216}You can get back|to the Blaisedales now.
{73781}{73887}Well, it looks to me as if we're just about|as ready as we're going to be.
{74179}{74231}You know, they're|closing down the wing soon.
{74234}{74332}- I wouldn't want you to miss the party.|- I'll be there.
{74834}{74889}We'll head down to the basement|to our storage level here
{74892}{74928}and work our way east to west.
{74931}{74996}- Make sense to you?|- Yeah, I think it'll work.
{74999}{75055}You got something for the dogs?
{75155}{75244}Pollux. Castor.
{75439}{75484}Hello.
{76003}{76051}Hello.
{76134}{76228}- Margo, are you here?|- I'm at the electron microscope.
{76231}{76302}Come on, girl. It's party time.
{76319}{76379}Wait. You're not even dressed yet.
{76382}{76416}I need you to take a look at this.
{76419}{76490}I'm not gonna take a look at anything|until you get dressed.
{76493}{76573}That parasite Greg Lee is gonna steal|your grant right out from under you
{76576}{76659}- unless you get in there and start pitching.|- All right. All right.
{76662}{76738}Try and guess what that is.
{76872}{76935}I don't think I've ever seen|anything quite like this before.
{76938}{77010}- It's a dermestid beetle.|- Dermestid? Are you sure?
{77013}{77071}Remember the leaves from|Whitney's crate? - Yeah.
{77074}{77107}That beetle ate part of one.
{77110}{77198}I ran some cells through the interpolator|searching for a match.
{77201}{77252}It came back|"dermestid beetle".
{77255}{77392}But the analysis also revealed|a large percentage of reptilian DNA.
{77414}{77478}Reptilian? Well, there|must be some mistake, Margo.
{77481}{77555}- I ran it through three times.|- There must be something in the leaf.
{77558}{77612}Take a look at that printout.
{77626}{77666}Hormones. Lots of them.
{77669}{77840}Gammaglobulin AXY,|left positive, reverse transcriptase.
{77851}{77942}That's an enzyme almost always found|in association with viruses.
{77945}{78005}This plant is heavily|infected with a virus.
{78008}{78058}So it's taken over|some of the plant cells
{78061}{78154}and inserted its own genetic material|into the plant's genes.
{78157}{78251}But why would a virus|code for animal proteins?
{78617}{78650}Mr. Mayor.
{78653}{78695}Your Honor,|how do you feel about the exhibit?
{78698}{78746}- Very, very proud.|- Are you superstitious?
{78749}{78810}Only around election time.
{78813}{78850}Let's go, Castor.|Come on, Pollux.
{78853}{78918}Come on, boy. Come on.
{78921}{78962}- Anything?|- No, nothing yet.
{78965}{79048}There's a lot of foreign smells down here,|which might knock off their olfactors.
{79051}{79136}We'll have to take it slow.|Come on, boy. Attaboy!
{79889}{79963}- Looking very dapper tonight.|- You think so?
{79966}{80022}'Cause I don't see too many other guys|wearing these ruffles.
{80025}{80073}You look cool.
{80109}{80174}Your Honor, so pleased to see you.
{80177}{80210}So excited about being here.
{80213}{80289}What you got? What you got? That's right.|Come on. What you got? What you got?
{80292}{80352}What you got? What you got?
{80356}{80417}We know these hormones|are responsible for growth,
{80420}{80506}bone structure, exoskeletal physiology|and skin maintenance.
{80509}{80578}A huge influx of these|could easily cause it to change.
{80581}{80605}Of course it could.
{80608}{80662}Do you think Whitney knew|about the properties of these leaves
{80665}{80689}before he sent them?
{80692}{80749}Maybe he wasn't just using them|as packing material.
{80752}{80801}Maybe there was nothing missing|from the crate.
{80804}{80912}Maybe the leaves were the shipment.|But why? I don't get it.
{80915}{80954}Margo.
{80960}{81022}The hormones listed|in this analysis of the leaf,
{81025}{81096}they're all produced|by the human hypothalamus.
{81099}{81159}Of course, it's a much more|concentrated form here,
{81162}{81254}and one milligram of this material|is equal to more than 100 milligrams
{81257}{81292}of the hormone produced|by the hypothalamus.
{81295}{81340}Wait, wait.|Remember when the Lieutenant
{81343}{81388}said something|about the human hypothalamus?
{81391}{81493}Yeah. - Do you think this is somehow|connected to Fred Ford's murder?
{81496}{81640}Well, if it is, whoever killed Fred Ford|really needs the hormones on that leaf.
{81643}{81694}We better find|Lieutenant D'Agosta.
{81771}{81843}Where the hell is Margo?
{81914}{81977}He's absolutely correct.
{82052}{82130}Harriet, George, I'm so|pleased to see you. - Hello.
{82133}{82187}- This is wonderful. Wonderful.|- Thank you.
{82190}{82241}Come with me. I have someone|I want to introduce you to.
{82244}{82274}Thank you.
{82277}{82359}Michael, Candice,|I want you to meet the Blaisedales.
{82362}{82408}- Harriet and George.|- Hello.
{82411}{82468}Come on. What've we got?
{82501}{82542}Detective!
{82686}{82779}- Run. Find, find!|- I've got you.
{82951}{83076}Johnson, Parkinson here. It's time to|shut down the outer cells. Do you read?
{83079}{83149}Right, sir.|Still checking the lab area.
{83152}{83205}Lab area? Everyone was|supposed to be out by 6:00.
{83208}{83272}I just came from the lab, Mr. Parkinson.|I was the last one out.
{83275}{83339}You sure? It could be a long night|for anyone locked in down there.
{83342}{83399}It's completely deserted.
{83417}{83485}It's clear. Shut it down.
{83527}{83579}Shutting down.
{83877}{83918}Done.
{83969}{84069}If he's not upstairs, one of the other officers|will probably know how to find him.
{84072}{84140}- It's locked.|- Well, it seems that that imbecile Parkinson
{84143}{84222}made good on his promise.|He sealed off the entire wing.
{84225}{84261}- Come on, Professor.|- Where?
{84264}{84311}Down the fire stairs|and across the sub-basement.
{84314}{84380}- Down the stairs?|- I hope your brakes work.
{84462}{84530}- Champagne. How lovely.|- Yes.
{84533}{84615}- Thank you very much, Mister...|- Lee. Greg Lee.
{84618}{84717}And may I say how enchanting you look|this evening, Mrs. Blaisedale.
{84720}{84801}- We've gone off the map, Evans.|- This is the old coal tunnel.
{84804}{84830}- Lieutenant.|- Yeah?
{84833}{84902}- The scent seems to be getting stronger.|- What the hell is this?
{84905}{84973}Electric trams hauled coal right into|the basement from the old barges.
{84976}{85038}- That's how Chicago stayed warm.|- How far does it go?
{85041}{85074}This one goes|all the way to Lake Michigan.
{85077}{85137}At least that's what they say.|No one really comes down here.
{85140}{85172}Let me ask you something.
{85175}{85227}Could somebody get off a ship|docked at the lake
{85230}{85263}and go through these tunnels
{85266}{85323}all the way to the museum|without being seen?
{85326}{85378}- Sure.|- We're moving now, guys.
{85381}{85423}Let's go.
{85768}{85837}- What in god's name is that smell?|- I don't like this.
{85840}{85865}Okay, we can do this.
{85868}{85914}Bradley and I go together.|Evans, you're behind me.
{85917}{86010}Hollingsworth, stay here. If I call you,|get that cannon up there. Let's go.
{86065}{86112}Come on, Castor.
{86299}{86359}There's something moving|right in front of us!
{86362}{86456}Castor, Pollux, heel! Heel!
{86553}{86614}Hollingsworth! Hollingsworth!
{86713}{86756}You okay?
{86821}{86892}Castor? Pollux?
{87031}{87081}Holy shit!
{87261}{87326}Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ!|What the hell did this?
{87329}{87376}Castor?
{87382}{87458}- Oh, dear god! Pollux!|- Bradley, no!
{87461}{87514}- Pollux!|- Bradley!
{87517}{87547}Pollux!
{87550}{87583}Hollingsworth. Hollingsworth!
{87586}{87619}Take Evans|and get your ass upstairs.
{87622}{87674}Find Cuthbert, Parkinson,|whoever the hell's in charge,
{87677}{87758}and clear out the museum.|Go! Now!
{87774}{87816}Bradley!
{87843}{87888}Bradley!
{87986}{88028}Bradley!
{88199}{88246}- Are you lost, Margo?|- Of course I'm lost.
{88249}{88296}Just checking.
{88454}{88494}Pollux!
{88514}{88557}Pollux!
{88564}{88605}Pollux!
{88631}{88670}Pollux!
{88684}{88723}Pollux!
{88765}{88850}Come on, boy.|Come on. Let's go.
{88877}{88945}Come on.|What's the matter with you?
{89677}{89795}Ladies and gentlemen, welcome|and thank you very much for being here.
{89798}{89905}I'd like to introduce to you|one of this museum's best friends
{89908}{89964}and staunchest supporters,
{89967}{90067}the mayor of our city,|the Honorable Robert Owen.
{90103}{90178}Thank you, Dr. Cuthbert.|Ladies and gentlemen,
{90181}{90317}I am so excited and honored to be here|at this wonderful museum this evening.
{90321}{90373}As we march forward
{90376}{90450}with fragile footsteps into the sunset|of the last few years...
{90453}{90520}- Is he speaking English?|- I don't know.
{90527}{90604}Bradley! Bradley!
{92181}{92300}Here, boy. You scared me.|You scared me.
{92843}{92936}- This coffee's terrible.|- It's bitter. Very bitter.
{93001}{93066}- What do you think, darling?|- The telling moment.
{93069}{93110}Not for me. Not today.
{93218}{93271}...the beginning of|superstition, really...
{93274}{93370}- Excuse me. Excuse me. Thank you.|- ...in Egypt very early about 50,000 B.C.
{93417}{93500}But here's the "piece de résistance".
{93503}{93664}This is a very rare sacrificial palette|from Mesoamerica.
{93682}{93758}- The priests would sacrifice their victims...|- Excuse me. Excuse me.
{93761}{93828}- ...by cutting out the beating heart.|- Excuse me.
{93831}{93936}- That's pleasant. Then what?|- Well, then they would eat it.
{93939}{94025}You know, I think I could use|one of these things down at City Hall.
{94028}{94080}Shall we?
{94201}{94300}Primordial forest. There's Pan.
{94389}{94528}And here we are in Brazil.|We're with the spirits of the Amazon now.
{94539}{94638}And here is the great devil god,
{94641}{94749}the Kothoga, sitting on the|skulls of his dead victims.
{94752}{94809}- Look out.|- Out of the way.
{94832}{94880}Look at this.
{94994}{95062}You know, I wonder what...
{95104}{95173}What the...|What in the hell...
{95193}{95221}Come on. Come on.
{95224}{95262}- Dr. Cuthbert.|- Wait.
{95265}{95307}- Oh, god.|- Mr. Mayor!
{95337}{95414}Excuse me!|May I ask what you think you're doing?
{95417}{95463}My name's Hollingsworth,|Chicago homicide.
{95466}{95529}We have to get everybody|out of here now.
{95551}{95612}We got a very dangerous situation,|Your Honor.
{95978}{96018}What the hell...
{96081}{96124}Come on. Let's go!
{96197}{96225}Holy shit, look at this.
{96228}{96292}We got a robbery alert|in the new exhibition space.
{96369}{96444}- What the hell is going on?|- I have no idea, but I'll find out.
{96447}{96523}- Keep moving.|- Come on, let's go.
{96543}{96624}Five, six, seven.|The whole board's going down.
{96734}{96818}Code 27.|It says we're having an earthquake!
{96871}{96956}This is Chicago.|We don't have earthquakes in Chicago.
{96959}{97039}Johnson, Wootton,|we've got problems up here!
{97107}{97188}The computer's forcing down|the last cell doors.
{97242}{97301}Jesus! This diorama wall,|can't we override manually?
{97304}{97334}Not in code status, I can't.
{97337}{97375}We're gonna have to reset|the whole system.
{97378}{97444}That's impossible.|Somebody's fucking with us.
{97865}{97954}Shit. We're shut down.|Everything is shut down.
{100313}{100402}Wootton, Johnson, what the hell's going on|up there? The fire doors are down.
{100405}{100462}- Shit!|- Wootton, Johnson, it's Parkinson.
{100465}{100511}Where the hell are you?
{100525}{100569}Phones are out.
{100572}{100639}And all the power's out|all over the museum.
{100642}{100706}Well, what about the|emergency generator?
{100709}{100826}It's only for the lab area to keep their|computer systems and refrigerators going.
{100829}{100919}It's over in the east wing.|It's about a mile from here.
{100948}{100998}What about the backup batteries|for the security system?
{101001}{101070}Maybe we can reboot,|then get it back online.
{101073}{101144}It's over in the|power room somewheres.
{101151}{101192}I'll go.
{101224}{101298}Excuse me, sir. May I ask you|a few questions? Can I ask you a few...
{101301}{101388}Don't lock the door.|I hate when you do that.
{102107}{102162}What the hell did that?
{102165}{102266}Control, this is Parkinson.|What the hell is going on down there?
{102269}{102325}Would you answer me,|for Christ's sakes?
{102328}{102387}Someone fucking trashed|the backup system.
{102390}{102448}Wootton, Johnson, it's Parkinson.|Where the hell are you?
{102451}{102529}Hey, asshole.|Aren't you gonna answer the man?
{102737}{102784}I can't reach the|damn control room.
{102787}{102853}All right. McNally, help me get a count.|Let's figure a way out of here.
{102856}{102948}We can't lift the fire door|until we get the computer restarted.
{102951}{103011}The fire stairs|only lead to the basement.
{103014}{103051}Then maybe that's what we'll do.
{103054}{103142}Heel. Heel. What is it?
{103161}{103196}What is it?
{103199}{103225}This is absurd.
{103228}{103310}Every police officer in the city of Chicago|is gonna be on the other side of that door
{103313}{103408}in five minutes trying to figure out a way|to get through. We wait here.
{104350}{104395}You ready?
{104499}{104562}I don't think you understand|how this works.
{104565}{104645}You're a junior detective.|You don't order the Mayor to do anything.
{104648}{104714}All I know is I've been ordered to get|everybody out of this building.
{104717}{104811}Now someone or something is in here.|You saw what it can do.
{104817}{104909}- Sorry, but I'm not budging.|- Is anybody there?
{104918}{105000}- Wootton?|- No, D'Agosta. Put the Mayor on.
{105029}{105087}Put him on!
{105090}{105145}It's for you, Your Honor.
{105201}{105250}- Put this over your head.|- This is Mayor Owen.
{105253}{105294}Mayor Owen,|this is Lieutenant D'Agosta.
{105297}{105362}- Lieutenant D'Augusta.|- D'Agosta, sir.
{105365}{105449}Vincent. Badge number 14173.|We spoke once before.
{105452}{105518}- Do you remember?|- I want you to consider very carefully...
{105521}{105582}With all due respect, sir,|you can fire me on Monday.
{105585}{105654}But right now, I want you|to shut your fucking mouth and listen.
{105657}{105711}I'm putting|Sergeant Hollingsworth in charge,
{105714}{105784}and you're going to do exactly|what he tells you to do.
{105787}{105833}- Or what, Lieutenant?|- Or none of you
{105836}{105885}are gonna live to see election day.
{105888}{105914}Hollingsworth.
{105917}{105992}- Hollingsworth, are you there?|- Excuse me, Your Honor.
{105995}{106048}- I'm here, Lieutenant.|- Take the fire stairs back down
{106051}{106129}to the sub-basement|and head west into the service area.
{106132}{106207}Go through the passageway|for the old coal line.
{106210}{106259}You'll come up across the street|from the museum.
{106262}{106352}Now you go slow. You go quiet.|You stick together.
{106355}{106412}- You understand?|- I got it.
{106445}{106502}I'm not walking through some|filthy crawl space...
{106505}{106556}Shut up, Tom!
{106589}{106660}- Let's go.|- Let's move.
{106733}{106813}Excuse me, but I don't care|what the Lieutenant,
{106816}{106882}whatever the hell his name is, says.|I'm staying!
{106885}{106944}I'm afraid my wife and I|will be staying, as well.
{106947}{106999}Mr. Blaisedale,|we must stay together.
{107002}{107073}But she won't physically be able to go|downstairs or through tunnels.
{107076}{107107}It's best if we stay behind.
{107110}{107167}- One of us can carry her.|- It's out of the question.
{107170}{107204}We'll be fine here.
{107207}{107293}Okay, officer, I'll stay behind|and protect Mr. and Mrs. Blaisedale.
{107296}{107328}Give me a break!
{107331}{107383}We're not going.|What are you gonna do?
{107386}{107450}- Shoot us?|- All right. All right.
{107454}{107508}One of you stay here with them.|Now who's it gonna be?
{107511}{107557}- I'll stay.|- I'll stay.
{107563}{107620}McNally, you're staying.
{107644}{107728}- You got plenty of ammo?|- I'm loaded.
{107741}{107812}Okay, let's move.
{107815}{107870}Dr. Cuthbert. Dr. Cuthbert.
{107873}{107918}I'm sorry, but I don't think|you should do this.
{107921}{108000}Bullshit, Tom. You're fired.
{108088}{108174}I'll lead with the shotgun.|Bailey, you stay at the back.
{108177}{108246}The rest are single file.|Now, it's gonna be dark.
{108249}{108349}We go slow, we go quiet|and we stick together.
{108381}{108414}- Inside.|- Thank you.
{108417}{108450}- I got you.|- You all right?
{108453}{108532}Come on. - All right,|stay close and watch your step.
{108606}{108663}Let's keep it going.|Keep it going.
{108666}{108721}Can I get you a drink?
{108895}{108952}What is it, boy?
{109008}{109050}Let's go.
{109371}{109418}Oh, god, Lieutenant D'Agosta!|We've been trying to find you!
{109421}{109480}You got to get out of here.
{109517}{109568}Oh, my god! No!
{109827}{109880}Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
{110396}{110458}Somebody want to tell me|what in god's name that was?
{110461}{110507}I think it's the Kothoga.
{110510}{110553}John Whitney must have found it|somewhere, somehow
{110556}{110594}and sent it back to the museum.
{110597}{110658}But, for god's sake,|why wouldn't he give us warning?
{110661}{110719}How big were those crates|that John Whitney sent back?
{110722}{110747}Not very big.
{110750}{110803}How the hell does something like that|fit inside one of them?
{110806}{110915}In those crates that Whitney sent back,|the artifact was packed in a leaf specimen
{110918}{111025}that carried a parasitic fungus.|The fungus was loaded with hormones,
{111028}{111135}animal hormones that are produced|in the thalamoid region of the human brain.
{111138}{111218}- You mean the hypothalamus.|- I know this is crazy,
{111221}{111298}but maybe this animal started out|as something else,
{111301}{111397}a chameleon, a lizard,|maybe even a dog.
{111400}{111504}It ate those leaves, and it changed|into whatever it is now.
{111550}{111600}Into what we just saw.
{111649}{111744}You're not crazy, Margo.|Don't you see, girl?
{111751}{111836}It's the Callisto Effect.|It's really true.
{111839}{111906}The Kothoga myth|was based on fact.
{111909}{111981}People of the Zenzera tribe,|when they were threatened by an enemy,
{111984}{112060}they must have fed some of those|hormonal leaves to some animal,
{112063}{112162}and it caused a riot in its DNA,|and it was transformed into
{112165}{112254}some horrific beast, but the beast|needed those hormones to stay alive.
{112257}{112325}So when it was big enough|and deadly enough, they stopped feeding it.
{112328}{112397}So it would have to find some other way|to get the hormone.
{112400}{112494}Their enemies. Yes, and when the enemies|were dead, it had no more hormones,
{112497}{112578}it would eventually die and the Zenzera|would come out from hiding.
{112581}{112666}Well, we don't have time to wait|for eventually. So, here's my question.
{112669}{112752}- How the fuck do we kill that thing?|- I have to figure out what this is first.
{112755}{112785}We need to get back to my lab.
{112788}{112834}I'll never make it up those stairs.|You leave me here.
{112837}{112873}- I'll carry you.|- Don't be ridiculous.
{112876}{112956}You have more important things to do.|I'm staying here.
{113657}{113698}Right here!
{113821}{113896}All right, it's Martin.|I'm here on the ground.
{113958}{114033}Let's clear this area.|Clear the steps.
{114424}{114494}First I liquefy and|purify my sample.
{114497}{114597}Then this machine will amplify|the DNA strand,
{114617}{114703}and finally scan|the created gel image.
{114706}{114794}Then it's matched against a huge database|we've compiled over the last three years.
{114797}{114844}Very impressive.
{114866}{114931}- How long is this gonna take?|- A little while.
{114934}{114978}- That's terrific.|- What have you got there?
{114981}{115032}Good luck bullet.
{115065}{115129}- Superstitious. I remember now.|- Yeah.
{115132}{115218}- So, does your bullet have a story?|- I was on the beat my rookie year,
{115221}{115282}and I saw this guy|who'd locked his keys in his car
{115285}{115311}with his motor running.
{115314}{115382}He's got a clothes hanger|and he's trying to get the lock off.
{115385}{115414}So I go over,|try to help him out,
{115417}{115470}and what I didn't know was|that he'd just robbed
{115473}{115569}a liquor store a block away.|So, he's concentrating so hard, you know.
{115572}{115658}He doesn't see me|till I'm right up on top of him.
{115661}{115729}I surprise him. He turns and...
{115764}{115820}Point blank range.
{115831}{115898}It doesn't pop, though.
{115901}{115988}Doesn't go off. This bullet.
{116128}{116170}So, what did you do?
{116173}{116235}I took the gun away from him|and beat the shit out of him.
{116238}{116343}Anyway, the forensics told me later|that the bullet's perfect.
{116346}{116418}It should have fired.|I should be dead.
{116422}{116537}- So, in other words, a miracle of physics.|- Maybe just plain old-fashioned good luck.
{116681}{116724}This is Martin.|Has anybody seen the Mayor?
{116727}{116775}Give me a location on the Mayor.
{116916}{116951}What people don't realize is that
{116954}{117018}molecular biology is|the science of the future.
{117021}{117066}You know what I mean?|If people were just given...
{117069}{117168}I'm not taking the fall for this fiasco,|I can tell you that.
{117189}{117266}Come Monday morning,|everything will get straightened out.
{117269}{117370}And whatever prankster|created this miasma, I swear to god,
{117373}{117433}when I get my hands on him...
{117862}{117901}God!
{119877}{119943}There's no exact match here.|Surprise, surprise.
{119946}{120008}4%. 2%... Wait a minute.
{120011}{120066}Hemidactylus turcicus 45%?
{120069}{120135}- It's a gecko, same as the beetle.|- What are you talking about?
{120138}{120202}Well, whatever this thing was,|it ate those leaves
{120205}{120292}and is rapidly evolving|into something reptilian.
{120306}{120367}- You mean it's still changing.|- It's quite possible.
{123110}{123196}Help! Pull me up! Pull me up!
{123199}{123264}- We got you!|- We got you!
{123288}{123366}Pull me up, man! Pull me up!
{123426}{123489}Help me! Help!
{123561}{123624}- Help me!|- Hold on! Hold on!
{123627}{123690}Please! God!
{123748}{123827}Help me! Help! Help me!
{125033}{125068}- It can't be.|- What? What is it?
{125071}{125135}33% homo sapien.
{125138}{125223}- Are you telling me that thing's part human?|- No, I'm saying more than that.
{125226}{125293}According to this data,|that thing started out as a human.
{125296}{125348}I'm gonna keep scanning.|There must be some error.
{125351}{125392}Lieutenant.
{125398}{125456}Hollingsworth. Where are you?
{125459}{125513}I'm just about to take them|into the coal tunnels.
{125516}{125562}Shit. I think that thing|is following us, Lieutenant.
{125565}{125598}I think it knows where we are.
{125601}{125709}Okay, now, listen. Those tunnels lead|right across the street. Just keep going.
{125712}{125750}Get those people out.
{125753}{125832}We're gonna follow you|and decoy the fucker away.
{125853}{125898}Hollingsworth.
{125950}{126005}I'll see you out on the street.
{126107}{126184}Where are those leaves with the hormones|that thing likes to eat?
{126219}{126298}Okay, we know this thing is part reptilian,|probably ectothermic,
{126301}{126359}so it can't handle|extremes of hot and cold.
{126362}{126458}Maybe if we can change its temperature|by 30 to 40 degrees...
{126469}{126542}- What do you mean "maybe"?|- We can freeze the son of a bitch.
{126545}{126599}- Come on.|- Here.
{126889}{127007}- Dr. Frock?|- Let me go first.
{127198}{127287}- Don't look.|- No, no, no!
{127524}{127571}I'm really sorry.
{127813}{127857}Let's go.
{128547}{128609}Get me more guns, god damn it!
{128715}{128774}Hollingsworth, you read me?
{128777}{128836}Hollingsworth, you read me?
{128858}{128935}Yeah, Lieutenant, I'm here.|Scared shitless.
{128938}{129023}- But I'm here.|- Just keep moving. We're on our way.
{129050}{129090}You hear me?
{129093}{129158}- You read me?|- Yeah. I got it.
{129161}{129191}I hope you know what we're doing.
{129194}{129250}- What was that?|- Just keep moving.
{129253}{129309}Just keep moving.
{130165}{130218}Hang on. Hang on.
{130273}{130324}Okay. Let's go.
{130462}{130497}- Bailey!|- Yeah?
{130500}{130556}It's not getting any deeper,|so keep them moving.
{130559}{130623}- All right.|- And watch your back.
{130695}{130744}Okay.
{131065}{131111}- Bailey.|- Yeah?
{131114}{131157}You hear something?
{131306}{131346}No.
{131405}{131449}Bailey!
{131497}{131539}Bailey!
{131576}{131618}Bailey!
{131705}{131740}Move out of the way.
{131743}{131784}Move!
{131821}{131880}Stay back!
{131917}{131958}Move!
{131969}{132025}- Bailey!|- What do you see?
{132123}{132170}I can't run.
{132735}{132819}This way, everybody. Go.
{133421}{133461}Listen up.
{133464}{133542}Now, whatever that was,|something made it go the other way.
{133545}{133639}So stay close to me|and I will get you out of here.
{133695}{133745}Give me the leaves.
{133757}{133811}I'm gonna take them and tie them|on that grate over there.
{133814}{133880}I think the draft will blow|the smell down the tunnels.
{135919}{135958}Come on.
{136348}{136397}Go! Hurry!
{136481}{136530}I found it.
{136579}{136646}- Good. Go! Go!|- Oh, thank god, we're out!
{136649}{136701}We're out, thank god.
{136725}{136797}- All right. All right. Everybody.|- Hurry.
{136800}{136879}- Let's go. All right.|- Come on, don't panic.
{137605}{137666}I'll need some help|for Dr. Cuthbert.
{137933}{137989}Give me that.|Get inside the lab and lock the door.
{137992}{138038}- What about you?|- Just get inside. I'll hold it off.
{138041}{138089}- Hold it off? You've seen that thing.|- Yeah, I've seen it.
{138092}{138146}Look, I know if we keep going,|we can find a way out.
{138149}{138192}I don't want a way out.|We've got to stop it.
{138195}{138241}I'll stay with you.
{138244}{138270}- Get inside.|- This is crazy.
{138273}{138328}- Get inside! Now!|- This is...
{138466}{138584}- This is stupid! Don't do this!|- Lock the goddamn door!
{138609}{138674}This is so stupid!
{139218}{139280}John Whitney? Oh, my god!
{139341}{139387}Lieutenant!
{139571}{139685}Dr. Green!|Dr. Green! Open the door!
{140393}{140443}Open the goddamn door!
{143443}{143517}Come on. Oh, god! Oh, god!
{143611}{143652}Come on.
{143669}{143756}Oh, god! Just keep coming.
{143766}{143808}Oh, god!
{143817}{143866}Just keep coming.
{143869}{143920}Attaboy.
{144187}{144229}Oh, god!
{144411}{144473}Look, I...
{144485}{144536}I know who you are.
{145033}{145088}Oh, god!
{147261}{147305}You go to hell!
{148117}{148163}Captain, we finally|got through that door.
{148166}{148216}We found two more bodies|inside the main room.
{148219}{148251}- Not the Mayor.|- I can't tell, sir.
{148254}{148297}- They're pretty badly messed up.|- How about the others?
{148300}{148352}Well, we got the power up,|trying to get into the other levels,
{148355}{148420}- but it's a big place.|- When I get my hands on that D'Agosta,
{148423}{148494}- he'll be back in a fucking squad car.|- Captain.
{148506}{148562}- Are you in charge here?|- Mr. Mayor.
{148565}{148596}How'd you get out?
{148599}{148638}It's a long story, Captain.
{148641}{148682}Look, these people|are cold and tired.
{148685}{148736}I'd like to get them under a roof|as soon as possible.
{148739}{148795}- Yes, sir.|- And leave De Augusta alone.
{148798}{148867}Or else you might be back|in that squad car.
{149037}{149091}Lieutenant!
{149104}{149194}- Jesus! You all right? You okay?|- I'm okay. Get me up.
{149205}{149264}- Get me up.|- All right.
{149365}{149411}- Let's go! Let's go!|- Go, go, go!
{149414}{149459}Get in there.
{149516}{149552}- Have you seen Dr. Green?|- No.
{149555}{149602}- Did you get those people out?|- Most of them.
{149605}{149644}- Lieutenant, over here.|- You did well.
{149647}{149704}- There's somebody inside.|- Open it up.
{149707}{149747}Open it up.
{150289}{150340}That's all we got here.
{150566}{150608}Keep it.
{150640}{150688}Let's go.
Hey, this is it, loco.
Hey, man. Fuck this, man.
I ain't with this shit.
Y'all can have this.
What?
I just ain't into this dead people shit, all right?
Shit, man. That place does look evil as hell.
Look, man, both y'all need to shut the fuck up, all right?
We're doin' this shit
'cause this here's business, man.
Besides, dead people ain't who y'all need to be worried about anyway.
Little Moe who the fuck y'all need to be worried about.
Now, the sooner we get the shit...
The sooner we raise up outta this motherfucker, man.
Pass the buds, you little bitch.
Let's roll, brother.
Hey, man, uh...
Maybe I need... I need to stay out here, all right, and watch y'all's back and shit, in case something funny go down.
Wait a minute, man.
You got your gat, man?
Yeah, I got my shit.
Well, if a dead motherfucker come fuckin' with you, you kill his ass.
Do you understand me?
Yeah, hold on...
Hold on, bulldog.
How am I supposed to kill somethin' that's already dead, man?
What?
Yeah, how am I supposed to kill somethin' that's already dead?
That's like killing some shit twice, man.
Yeah, like some re-fried beans and some shit.
Man, I never understood that, man.
Why the fuck you gonna re-fry some beans, man?
Why not just fry that shit right the first time and get out?
Look, both y'all, shut the fuck up, all right?
Let's just take care of this business and move on, man.
Shit.
Fuck... this is dead people's shit!
All right, shut up.
Ain't nothin' to be scared of.
Understand me?
- Damn!
- What the fuck? Let's go!
I've been waiting for you, boys.
- I have some iodine in the lab.
- Hey, man.
I don't need nothin' from your house of dead folks, okay?
Besides, I ain't no baby.
Of course, you're not.
'Looked like one when that door swung open.
Nigger, what's up, man?
Come on... come on, partner.
Got no time for this.
Let's just take care of this business and move on, man.
Now, where's the shit?
The shit?
The shit...
The shit that you found.
Oh.
The drugs.
I found a whole stock of them in the alley.
So where they at?
You got the money?
Yeah, we got the money, old man.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You'll get it when we get the shit.
The shit?
The shit. The drugs.
You get the drugs, then I get the money.
Okay.
You know, this is all new to me.
I'm not a drug dealer.
I'm a mortician.
The only drugs I know about...
Are those that have to do with the deceased.
Yo, man, what kind of drugs do dead people be needin'?
All kinds.
We shoot them real good with embalming fluid, mainly.
You know, it keeps them from... smelling...
And decomposing before the service.
Cool.
Hey, so what happened to him?
Oh, they say he went crazy.
Death...
It comes in many strange packages.
Hey, man, I don't need to be hearin' this, man.
I mean, kill that noise, man.
Let's just get the shit.
Don't worry.
You'll get the shit.
You'll be knee-deep...
In the shit.
I've got it hid.
There's so much...
I couldn't even lift it all myself.
I'll tell you about... old Clarence here along the way.
Unless, of course... you're scared.
Hmm?
They say he was hearing voices...
Voices calling his name...
Voices from the dead...
Calling...
"Clarence!"
"Clarence!"
"Clarence!"
"Clarence!"
Now, Clarence, now this here is a real quiet neighborhood...
But that doesn't mean that you can take a break.
'Cause the second you slack off, boom!
That's just when the shit hits the fan.
Got it. Stay alert at all times.
That's right.
Now, let's go up and check out this out-of-place.
Gonna lose your badges over this.
You had no reason to pull me over.
You got a fuckin' taillight out.
Shut up and spread them goddamn legs.
You're not taking any more cops' badges.
They keep selling drugs in my community,
I'll keep taking 'em down.
You can bet on it!
Yeah? Well, we'll see about that.
- Hey, what do we got, fellas?
- No, no, no, rookie, rookie.
He'll get it. Just back...
Back off.
Go on your way.
Go run a check on his license plate.
See if the car is stolen.
- It's okay. Go on.
- We got it.
Come on. Spread 'em.
Spread 'em.
Now, let me ask you something, huh?
Are you getting off on, uh...
Destroying good cops' lives, hmm?
You big-mouthed goddamn son of a bitch!
I've got nothing against good cops.
You what?
I said I've got nothing against good cops...
But I will see lowlife scum like you run out of the department.
Will you shut the fuck up, cocksucker!
Shit!
You're fuckin' dead, bro.
You fucked up...
Big time.
Let me have some of this.
Let me have some.
Look at me!
Newton, you want in?
Yeah. Let me teach him a thing or two.
[ Laughs I you there, huh?
You inside, huh?
Are you there?
And I promise you... we won't stop until we get every single crooked cop in this city.
Oh, my god, Martin moorehouse.
Neither drugs nor pretenders of the law...
Will be allowed to drain the life of this community.
- Hey!
- Son of a bitch.
Hey!
Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?
Strum!
- Stop them! Stop 'em!
- That's enough, strom.
- Stop it!
- Not in front of the rookie.
This man is Martin moorehouse!
I can't believe
I didn't recognize him.
Fuck.
What the hell's wrong with you?
What the hell is wrong with you?
- Hey! Hey, back off!
- Fuck off!
This is no time to be fighting.
We gotta get this guy to a hospital!
That's right. We gotta get him to a hospital.
Now, let's do it, huh?
- Come on.
- God.
You hear?
You want some of me?
You're out of line!
You get your ass out of here.
We'll take care of it.
Get outta here!
You get back there in the unit!
- Get out of here.
- Finish our damn patrol!
Son of a bitch.
Strom, you know what you have to do.
Damn it! We...
We need to report those assholes, Newton.
You listen to me!
And you listen good.
Those assholes are cops.
Who the fuck are you to judge 'em?
Shit, man, you got a green dick.
Those two guys have been risking their asses on the street for years.
See, the fucker went for strom's gun.
Aw, bullshit.
Oh, now, maybe those two guys went too far tonight.
Maybe it was all a mistake.
But next time it could be you.
So, you know, you don't ever roll over...
And you never...
Rat out a fellow officer.
And you never... never break the code.
Knock, knock. We're here.
- Hospital?
- Mm-hmm.
Yeah. Come on, boy.
We'll get you all fixed up.
Wanna have a little party?
Hmm?
You see, you were right about one thing.
The cops are dealing drugs in the sixth precinct.
But you're never gonna tell about it, are ya?
- Think that's enough?
- Just put 'em in the trunk.
Clarence!
Bring them to me.
Bring them to me!
Clarence, bring them to me.
Bring them to me.
I will.
I will.
I will.
Welcome, officers.
For a minute, I thought you weren't gonna show.
Man, he looks like fly-covered shit.
Say what?
You look like fly-covered shit there, Clarence.
Haven't seen you in a long time,
Clarence.
I've missed ya, pal.
You had the number.
You should've reached out and touched a brother.
You could've told him how to reach out and touch a brother, couldn't you, strom?
Now, Clarence...
Clarence Smith...
Come on.
Come on.
Come on down from the grave.
Now, let me ask you this, son.
What the fuck you call us out here for, huh? Huh?
A celebration.
No, no, no.
Answer me, boy!
What'd you call us out here for?
To celebrate!
What are we celebrating tonight?
Anniversary.
Our anniversary.
You remember, don't you?
One year ago today.
I fell for your bullshit.
You know, I actually believed...
That strom and Billy were gonna take moorehouse to the hospital.
Shut the fuck up!
You don't get it, do ya?
We tried to take him, and he didn't wanna go.
You understand?
He didn't want to go.
Just cut the shit, strom!
- Shut the fuck up, boy:
- Clarence: Cut the shit!
Shut the fuck up!
Cut the shit!
That story never did make any sense.
- Just save it.
- Save it for who?
Hey, Clarence, if we go down, you go down.
Yeah, that's right, Clarence.
You go down.
You guys killed a good man and you ruined his name!
I should've turned you in instead of just quittin' the force.
You quit because you're a pussy.
You're a goddamn pussy.
So I thought the least we could do is pay our respects.
What do you mean "pay respects"?
Pay Martin moorehouse a little visit.
Or are you too much of a pussy to visit him?
A fuckin' fruitcake.
How are we supposed to visit a dead guy?
Are you saying...
You want us to go out to moorehouse's grave with you?
- That's exactly what I'm saying.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
Huh?
Fuck you.
If we go, will that be the end of it?
You'll be satisfied?
I'll be totally satisfied.
Well, in that case,
I don't think there's a problem.
- I got no problem.
- You guys agree?
Follow me, fellas.
- Lead the way.
- Let's go.
Hey, what the fuck are we doing?
Clarence won't be making it back.
How much further, Clarence?
Martin is right here.
This grave.
I brought them.
Are you happy?
Shit.
You expect us to believe you're talkin' to this dead fucker?
[ Laughs I quite frankly,
I don't know what to expect.
My orders were to get you out here.
I'm good at that, you know?
Following orders?
It's just an electrical storm.
What the hell, all of a sudden, we're supposed to be scared to death?
Is that it? Huh?
Don't know, strom.
Should you be?
You know what? You piss me off.
Hmm? You know that?
I'm gonna be the first to volunteer.
You're not gonna...
You know what I'm gonna do?
Huh?
You know what I'm gonna do, boy?
Get out of my way.
[ Laughs I
I'm gonna piss on...
I'm gonna piss on his grave.
[ Laughs I oh.
Way to go, strom.
That's... that's pretty cool.
You know what?
Kind of dry here.
Uh, Billy, why don't you come on over here and piss with me?
You know, I don't need to go, man.
I took a piss right before we came out here.
Did you hear what I said?
- Did you hear what I said?
- I don't need to.
I said go piss on it.
Now, do it!
For Christ's sakes, strom, leave him alone.
It's okay, man.
Piss.
This'll be as good a place as any to bleed the old lizard, I guess.
Come on.
Say good night.
Come on now.
Shouldn't have done that, man.
What in the hell have you done?
Strum!
Holy shit!
Let him go!
Where the fuck did he go?
Oh, god!
Where the fuck did he go?
Get outta the way!
Stop shooting, goddamn it!
There's nothing there!
He's gone!
Damn it, man, this is no time to panic!
Well, when the fuck do we start to panic?
- Holy shit!
- Jesus!
Oh, god.
Please!
Billy!
- Billy!
- What?
Oh, no!
Billy. The fucker.
Now! Shoot him!
Damn!
Now's a good time to panic!
Damn!
Get the hell outta here!
Come on, man!
To the car!
- Punch it!
- Fuck!
Right now!
- I'm trying to, goddamn it!
- Oh, for goddamn sake!
Get out...
Get the hell back!
Get back goddammit!
He's still there!
How far back?
Jesus Christ!
He's right behind us.
How far back?
Get him off the car!
Get him off!
What are you doing?
And what are you...
What are you gonna tell 'em?
That the body of a citizen we murdered has come back to kill us?
Use your fuckin' head for once!
Besides, he's gone, man!
Bullshit!
Bullshit!
What's happening?
Jesus! Where the hell is he?
I don't fuckin' know, man.
No!
Strum!
Now you!
No.
No.
No.
No, you're dead!
You're dead!
You're dead.
Motherfuck...!
Beat it, cop!
You see him? You see him?
I killed him! I killed him!
Oh, yeah... I killed him.
I killed him.
Whoa. Hey, man!
No!
Welcome to my world.
Are you satisfied now, brother?
Where were you...
When I needed you, brother?
[ Whimpering no, please, don't...
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Don't hurt me.
So, what's the story with this guy?
Homicidal maniac.
Cop killer.
Three in one night.
And trip this.
He used to be a cop.
Wow!
Man, you just never know, do ya?
Yes, sir. Crazy as a loon.
Talk about some insane in the membrane type of shit.
Shut up, man.
The pigs got what they deserved, homeboy.
Nah, man.
What shit are you talking about, man?
It can't be for real.
Sometimes... reality is just a matter of perception.
What the fuck now?
Reality.
Perception.
A cornucopia of clashing.
Divergent ideas.
Crazy, man.
Hey, come on, man.
Man, what type of shit?
What the fuck happened to him?
Hey, can we just get our shit and go?
Oh, no.
You're gonna want to hear about this one.
It's a classic case...
Of what is and isn't real...
In the mind...
Of a boy... named Walter.
Perception?
Reality?
Walter.
All right, everybody, take your seats.
Okay, we have a new student joining us today.
I want you all to say hello to Walter.
Hello, Walter.
- You wanna do something, punk?
- Yeah, we don't like punks.
- I'm not a punk.
- "I'm not a punk."
Who you shovin', bitch?
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Everybody go back to their class.
Oh, man!
What's your problem?
You must really like detention, huh, Ty?
Come on.
Here, honey.
Hold this up to your head.
So, uh, how's the little warrior doin'?
He's got a thick head.
I am worried about that, though.
Did Tyrone hit you in the eye?
That didn't just happen.
It's a couple of days old.
Look at the coloring.
Tyrone didn't hit you?
Well, who did?
Was it one of the other boys?
Walter.
Was it someone at home?
Maybe your mother?
Your father?
Did he do this?
Uh-uh. He's dead.
I'm sorry.
Walter, if you tell me and nurse parch-man...
It'll just be our little secret, okay?
The monster.
The monster?
He came after my dad died.
- I see.
- Hmm.
If you decide you want to tell me what really happened...
I'm gonna be here to listen, okay?
He said no one would believe me.
Mommy.
Walter.
He's back.
Is the monster gone?
Now, Walter, you be sure and put this back just like this.
Ow! Stop!
Walter?
You didn't want to go outside?
- What's that?
- Him.
- Him?
- The monster.
Laurie told me to draw it, then we'll destroy it...
And the monster's gonna go away.
- Laurie that sits behind you?
- I'm gonna burn him up.
Laurie said that her mom said to draw the things that scared her...
Then tear it up or burn it...
And then it'll go away.
That's Tyrone.
Walter...
Do you think I could, uh... talk to your mother sometime?
What for?
About the monster.
Now, you've told her, haven't you?
She doesn't want to hear it.
She says we already moved once.
You know, I don't think...
That drawing these pictures is really... the answer to your problem.
But I think we can work something out together, okay?
Okay?
I guess so.
Good. I will see you after recess.
All right.
Excuse me, guys.
What happened to him?
He was running in the building after recess and fell down the stairs.
Well, did somebody shove him?
- No, he just fell.
- No?
Sort of collapsed.
But, you know, it makes no sense.
How do you break both arms and legs falling down?
Boy must've had weak bones.
- Who is it?
- I'm Mr. Garvey.
I'm one of Walter's teachers from school.
Uh... this fell.
Thank you.
Is there a problem?
- No, no, Mrs... miss...
- Miss.
Miss Johnson, can I come in and talk to you for a minute?
Yes. I'm sorry.
I'm gonna go throw something on.
Damn.
Miss Johnson,
I came to talk to you about your boy Walter.
Because he seems to be having some problems.
Problems?
Uh...
Yeah. Perhaps because he just recently changed schools.
What kind of problems?
I mean, all kids have problems, don't they?
That's what life is... problems.
He got you good.
Here, step into the light for me?
Oh, yeah. Um...
Well, he seems to come to school with a lot bruises, you know?
Kind of banged up.
The boy is clumsy.
He's always falling over somethin'.
I don't know where he gets it.
Not me.
Certainly not me.
Certainly not.
But, uh...
But he does seem to have a strange...
Preoccupation with monsters.
I mean, a monster in particular...
That he says lives here in the house.
It sounds silly, but...
Walter!
Listen, there is no need to bring Walter into this.
Look!
I've told that boy about going on with these stories.
I can't have it.
Walter!
I said get your narrow behind in this kitchen now!
Miss Johnson,
I just came to talk to you.
Get over here.
What is your problem?
Now, why the hell are you going on telling this man these crazy stories?
Didn't I tell you to stop with all this monster foolishness? Didn't I?
Go to your room.
Baby, go to your room now.
I'm gonna have to deal with this.
Miss Johnson, if you would give me a second to talk?
Please... just keep quiet.
Don't say nothin'.
Well, why are you just standing there?
Why the hell didn't you get the door?
Who's that?
That's just one of Walter's teachers.
He was just leaving.
Is there a problem?
No.
Actually, he just came over to drop off some homework.
Actually, sir, now that you mention it...
Walter does seem to be having a few small problems...
That might deserve some looking into.
Well, Walter's only been at this school
for a couple of weeks...
And he does have trouble making friends.
So what kind of problem are we talking about?
Well, aside from the bruises...
Aside from that...
There's, uh, this monster that he says is in the house.
He seems very disturbed by it.
In fact, he's even drawn a picture...
Of the monster.
He, uh, thinks he needs to kill the monster.
I mean, he...
He really believes it.
I'll talk to him.
That's it?
You'll just talk to him?
I will talk to him.
Okay.
Sissy, would you show him to the door, please?
Thanks for the tea.
Go to your room.
- Miss Johnson...
- Go!
Walter!
You little motherfucker.
You like to draw fucked-up pictures of people, huh?
Huh?
Carl, no!
I'm gonna teach you and that boy some respect.
Help me!
Stop!
Stop!
You gonna make a picture to kill me?
Motherfuck...!
Come here!
Carl, please!
Open up!
Miss Johnson!
Your little ass is mine!
Oh, you gonna draw a picture of somebody and make them look like a monster?
But you think that shit is funny? Huh?
- Get up!
- Miss Johnson!
- You okay?
- He's gonna kill him.
- No!
- Wait! Wait... here.
Wait here!
Mom.
Carl, stop it!
Just take it easy!
Take it easy? This ain't your motherfuckin' house!
No!
- Take it easy.
- Motherfucker!
No!
'Get "no!"
I'm not through with this yet!
Come here! Come here.
- What's it gonna be?
- Let me go!
Motherfucker!
Have you lost your mind?
I see you ain't the only one need an ass-whoopin'!
Bitch!
This shit ain't over yet, bitch.
But I think it is.
What are we gonna do?
They find him here like this, no one's gonna believe us.
Don't worry.
Nobody's gonna find out anything.
Walter, you know what to do.
Yes, sir...
Walter... killed the monster.
Hmm.
Man, is that really how he got dropped?
Hey man, close this thing!
Oh.
What the fuck?
So dead motherfuckers be playin' with dolls now, right?
Yes. But this doll...
It's a way station for lost souls.
- What?
- Sometimes...
When a person's body has been through a lot...
The soul is displaced.
This doll is a place for the soul to survive...
Until it can move on.
Man, you for real?
Yes!
I found this doll...
In a house in the south.
It is an amazing thing.
You can give it any name you want.
The fact is, affirmative action, quotas, reparations...
All mean one thing...
Another qualified individual won't get a job...
Or an education...
Simply because he's not the right color.
I thought that's what we were trying to get away from.
Duke Metger for governor.
An original American.
Isn't it about time?
That's great.
I'd even vote for me.
Listen, by the time
I finish with you...
You might even get a few black votes in the till.
Well, a start would be just getting the bastards off my front lawn.
It's startin' to look like a damned minstrel show out there.
Duke must go! Duke must go!
They were as relentless about findin' a job...
As they are houndin' me...
We might put an end to welfare.
Duke must go! Duke must go!
Duke must go! Duke must go!
Beyond the obvious concern that the black and Jewish community share...
Over the candidacy of one-time
Klan member Duke Metger...
There seems to be an additional issue that has sparked anger in the black community.
Councilman Rogers, can you explain?
Loni, it's disturbing enough that Duke Metger...
Would claim residency here just for the sake of gaining racist votes.
But the real slap in the face to the black community...
Is that he chose this house...
This former plantation...
With its history of racism towards black people...
To set up camp.
Can anything be done?
Well, there are certain things that we plan to do.
Ain't nothin' we need to do!
They're gonna take care of it.
They gonna make him pay for bein' here!
Who will make him pay, sir?
The souls... the souls gonna make him pay!
They gonna make him pay for bein' here.
Miss Cobbs was the keeper of the souls.
And now, there's no peace.
There was peace but there's no peace in the Dollhouse now.
- The Dollhouse?
- The Dollhouse!
They gonna make him pay!
The Dollhouse!
Just an old myth around these parts.
Ain't no myth!
It ain't no myth!
It ain't no myth!
It ain't no myth!
Duke must go! Duke must go!
Go away, old man.
What is it about this house that has them so worked up?
After the civil war, the man who owned this plantation,
Nathan Wilkes, he, uh...
He's upset that his slaves were gonna walk away free.
When they tried to leave, the old man snapped.
Turned into a massacre.
Hundreds of slaves.
Lynchin's, burnin's.
Twelve bodies hangin' from that tree alone.
Yeah, they buried 'em in a common grave up on the hill.
Now, fools believe that their souls never rested...
Till miss Cobbs, an old voodoo woman, bought the place.
That's... that's her there in the mural.
- What are those?
- Dolls.
Legend is, she transferred the souls of the slaves into little dolls.
Negro dolls.
Word is, they remain in the house right to this day.
You ever seen any of 'em?
I searched every inch of this house when I first bought the place...
I figured the little black bastards might be worth something...
But no, I never found any.
Now they feel that the place should remain empty...
As a... as a remembrance to the atrocity...
To let the souls rest, like a...
Like an old Nazi camp.
Personally...
I think the whole thing adds to a certain Southern charm.
You're a sick fuck, Duke.
Uh, perhaps.
But it's your job,
Mr. $10,000-a-week image maker...
To change all that, to soften the hard edges.
Mold me into a respected man of the people.
Well, well, I've got my work cut out for me, don't I?
You know, the first thing we're gonna work on, Duke, is your defensive media skills.
When you get out here in front of these cameras...
These reporters, making these public appearances...
You've always got to expect the Unex...
This thing's kind of creepy, don't you think?
I'm gonna paint the whole place over after the election.
Let's get you elected first,
Duke.
Okay.
I feel I have a lot to offer all the constituents
of this community...
Not just the white constituents.
So are you telling us, Duke, that your former affiliation with the KKK...
Is not something that the voters should concern themselves with in this election?
We all have a past now, don't we?
No.
No, ho, no, no, "0," 0, no, no.
You're being much too defensive.
Looks like you have something to hide.
Look, I want you to watch me, all right?
Take the camera.
I want you to film me.
All right?
Hold on. Hold it, hold it.
Good.
We all... have a past.
It's the better man who can learn from his failures.
I know that I've learned from mine and I'm better for it.
Uh-huh.
Well, what about the house?
Well, I think that it's quite unfair to judge me or anyone else...
By the misdeeds of his ancestors.
After all, I have quite a few of my own to account for.
Aren't you afraid of the dolls?
What about the ghosts?
Well, the only spooks that I'm afraid of...
Are the ones with guns.
That's a good one, Rhodie.
I like that.
I believe I'm gonna use it.
Oh, no. Not if you want to get elected, you won't.
Okay? Jesus, I've been around you too long. Okay.
Look, Duke, this is the real response to that one, okay?
Oh! Oh, oh...
Okay.
You know, I'm not concerned with the ghost stories.
I'm concerned with traditional
American values.
Original...
Rhodie!
Let us bow our heads in prayer.
Unto the mercy of almighty god...
We commend the soul of our brother departed.
We commit his body to the ground...
Earth to earth...
Ashes to ashes...
Dust to dust...
In the sure and certain hope...
Of the resurrection to eternal life.
Any truth to the rumor that Mr. Willis' death was the result of some mysterious circumstances?
- What about that, sir?
- No, no.
It was simply an unfortunate accident.
Don't you think it would help your position with the black community...
If you simply left Wilkes manor and found another residence?
Yeah, I think it's unfair to judge me or any other person, by the misdeeds of their ancestors.
Besides, I have many misdeeds of my own to account for.
So, you're not afraid of the ghosts?
No, the only spooks
I'm afraid of... are you spooky reporters.
So, what is your real goal?
That's about it, folks.
Thank you.
You need to be scared,
Mr. Metger.
Them souls don't want you there.
They didn't want him there.
Now you best to leave...
Or you'll end up just like him, or worse.
Well, sir, I have no intention of leavin'...
So let's just hope that the house and I can get along.
Can't we all just...
Get along?
Heed my warning, Metger.
They don't want you there.
- That's about it. Thank you.
- The dolls don't want you there!
That's about it. Thank you!
Go away, old fool.
Do you hear me?
They want reparation!
They want reparation,
Mr. Metger!
Driver, who'd you let in this vehicle?
Stop the car.
Stop the damn car!
Goddamn it!
I let no one in the car, sir.
This is the real response to that one.
Okay?
- Here we go, all right.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Go.
I'm not concerned with ghost stories.
I'm concerned with traditional
American values.
Original American...
What the fuck?
Bruce, I need you or Janet to give me a call.
There's somethin' wrong here.
Bruce! Janet! You back?
Thank goodness.
You!
Where the fuck did your little black ass come from?
Huh?
You think you and some old voodoo bitch could scare me out of my house?
I don't care how many slaves died here.
I didn't kill 'em.
You get no reparations.
You hear me?
No reparations!
You goddamn voodoo bitch!
Huh?
I'll put an end to your nigger ass.
Now I'm gonna blow off your little nigger balls!
Huh?
Not even some voodoo bitch
Negress spell...
Can overcome the power of a double-barreled shotgun!
Goddamn.
Goddamn.
I'm not afraid of you!
I killed one of you!
I'll kill you all, you...
You little nigglin's!
Come on out, you little nappy-headed sons of bitches!
Come on.
Come on out.
Say good night, you little piece of black shit.
Oh, Jesus.
Goddamn!
Mother of Jesus!
Come on! Open!
I didn't...
I Di...
You.
I didn't...
Get off! Get off!
It gives you new reverence for dolls, now don't it?
I mean, fuck the Barbie.
This is bullshit, bulldog.
And what's up?
You gonna show us what we came here to get, or what?
Really, though.
See, I ain't got all night to be listenin' to no goddamn ghost stories.
These ain't ghost stories.
Everything I say is real.
Let's get this shit over with.
Let's see how real this shit is you got.
Ah, the shit.
[ Laughs I yo man, you ain't gonna believe this, man.
Man, this shit is a trip, homey.
Yes.
You knew him?
- Sure did.
- Hell, no.
We didn't know him. He was just a nigger we seen around.
Yeah.
He got himself involved...
In that crazy gang madness.
Yeah.
Shit.
He got himself involved...
In the shit.
There's that punk motherfucker Deke right there!
Catch you now, you motherfuckin' bitch.
Yeah, motherfucker.
Come on, nigger.
Smoke this, nigger.
Where the fuck you think you're goin', bitch?
Goddamn, nigger. You tryin' to blind me or somethin'? Shit!
- Hey, what's up, lil' Deke?
- What's up, nigger?
What's up with all that shit you been talkin' motherfucker?
Huh? Huh? Huh?
Bitch-ass nigger.
Son of a bitch!
Motherfucker!
Oh, shit!
Where you want me to shoot your ass, motherfucker?
In the head or in the chest?
Blast your little-ass dick off first.
- Man, fuck this, man!
- Hold up, hold up, hold up.
Don't do this cat just yet.
I wonder how many homies he done puked over the years.
Too fuckin' many!
You think he...?
What's up now, crazy K?
Oh, you crazy, huh?
Lookin' kinda fucked up.
Oh, yeah.
Fuck!
Fuck!
[ Coughs I shit!
Saved by the motherfuckin' cops.
Damn.
Oh, fuck.
Read me the summary on this one.
Uh..."Jerome Johns, serving the fourth year...
"Of a life sentence without a possibility of parole.
"Solitary confinement the last two years
"for assaults on other prisoners.
"Previous arrests and convictions included, uh...
"Aggravated assault, first degree battery...
Suspicion of murder three times, aggravated mayhem."
Jerome!
Jerome?
How would you like to be released from prison?
Man, is you fuckin' with my mind, or what?
How that shit gonna happen?
Consent to behavioral modification...
And you'll be out on the street in no time.
- Yo, let's do this.
- Yo, let's.
He'll do.
- Prepare him for transfer.
- Okay.
Get the fuck off me, man!
Shit!
Well, look what we have here.
The first soldier in my army, perhaps.
So you're a real bad-ass spade, huh?
What'd you say to me, motherfucker?
You heard me.
You gotta be really bad to be in a place like this.
Otherwise you wouldn't be here.
So what'd you do?
What you in for?
Murder, punk!
And I wouldn't mind doin' the shit again.
Me either.
I killed a lot of people.
You wanna know what kind?
Come over here.
I wanna show you somethin'.
What's wrong?
Are you afraid of me?
The final fight between black and white has begun.
I've led my troops on a wave of assaults...
To wake up my white brother.
All... of the niggers of the earth will be killed...
Except for the few that helped with the fight against...
Their mud-souled brethren.
Those few will be spared...
And live their lives as slaves.
Do you... wanna be spared?
Come join my army.
Hey, nigger, those guys you killed...
What color were they?
Huh?
They were niggers.
I know it.
You're cool with me, nigger.
I like you.
I like you a lot.
Yeah, I didn't like bein' put in there with that crazy
Klan motherfucker, either.
I purposely put you next to him, Jerome,
because I thought he was someone you ought to meet.
You are here to be rehabilitated...
By a process that the government has paid me to develop.
If you successfully complete this project...
There's a very good chance you might be released.
If you don't, you will rot in solitary confinement...
For the rest of your wasted life.
And it wouldn't bother me a bit...
'Cause I think you're scum, Jerome.
So don't test me.
You understand?
Our tests show you have a high IQ.
Have you ever been interested in science?
Yeah. I sold a few chemicals in my day.
Wait, wait.
Whoa, whoa.
I know you don't think
I'm gettin' on that thing.
You have no other choice.
Fuck!
Come on, man!
Shit!
[Gagging 1
I'll break your fuckin' neck when I get out this motherfucker!
[Gagging 1
I don't think so.
Motherfucker!
Start the optical sequences.
Jerome, I want you to take a little look at something.
What's wrong, Jerome?
You don't like seein' black people get killed?
But isn't that what you've been doin' all your life, Jerome?
You know, Jerome...
Cain was the world's first murderer.
He slayed his brother!
And how many brothers have you slain?
Sensory what?
Sensory deprivation chamber.
You will see nothing.
You will hear nothing.
Your mind will have nothing to feed upon but itself.
It's a tiny meal, indeed.
What's up, crazy K?
Remember me?
Tracy?
Yeah, man.
What's up?
How come we ain't talked in a long time?
That's right. You killed my ass!
Ain't that a bitch?
I got one question for you, crazy K.
Why?
Why?
Y... you was comin' up short all the time, man.
I... I couldn't just let you rip me off, nigger.
You didn't even know us.
That shit was wrong, man.
Just drove by and started blastin'.
That shit was wrong, man.
We ain't even the ones that capped your homey.
That shit was really wrong, G.
Man, fuck you, niggers!
It was your set that did my homey, little Joe!
Y'all motherfuckers would've tried to kill me if you had the chance!
Man, fuck you, niggers!
Fuck y'all!
I didn't do anything.
I was playing in my room, and the bullet from your gun came through the wall.
A... a bullet ain't got no name on it.
Y... you was just at the wrong place at the wrong time.
Shut up!
Shut the fuck up!
Why should they, Jerome?
Are they saying something you don't want to hear?
So you gonna blame all this shit on me?
You tryin' to make me crazy or somethin', motherfucker?
Huh?
I don't owe no responsibilities for these motherfuckers.
But you are responsible for the lives you've taken...
For the dreams you've turned into nightmares.
Nightmares?
Motherfucker, what about my nightmare?
What about the nightmare
I lived in?
What about the nightmare I lived in ever since
I was born into this motherfucker?
Who's responsible for that?
I don't know, Jerome.
You tell me.
Who is responsible?
Your mother? Your father?
Your teachers?
The world? Who?
Yeah, that's right.
All of those motherfuckers,
'cause they created me.
So now I'm the motherfuckin' nightmare!
The nightmare ends when you say it does, Jerome.
You've got to take responsibility to wake up!
You've got to take responsibility to break this chain!
I got one motherfuckin' responsibility in this world, and that's me.
And that's it, motherfucker!
So anybody and everything that ain't me, ain't shit!
Do you understand that?
That's a question best posed to yourself.
I'm givin' you a chance.
I'm givin' you a shot at redemption!
Do you understand that?
I don't give a fuck about none of you stupid motherfuckers!
So what you do is stop fuckin' with my mind, man...
And let me up out of this motherfucker!
There's nothing to stop you, Jerome.
Jerome!
Shut the fuck up!
Shut up!
Let me up out of this motherfucker or I swear to god
I'll snap this bitch's neck!
Jerome, it's not too late to be saved.
You won't get another chance.
I don't need another motherfuckin' chance.
You know why?
'Cause I don't give a fuck.
I said, I don't give a fuck.
I don't give a fuck!
- Jerome!
- I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck!
I don't...
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck!
We don't give a fuck either, motherfucker!
Oh, I must say.
I don't think you can rehabilitate those types.
No. You just kill them.
Who you think you're fuckin' with, old man?
What?
Yeah, cap this fool.
What? What?
You know what!
Dude, I'm just sick of playin' this ring-around-the-rosies.
- Now, that last little story?
- Mm-hmm?
That shit wasn't funny.
Yeah, what you gonna do?
Call the cops or some shit?
Now, why...
Would I do that?
'Cause you know who it was that killed the nigger and you ain't said shit.
Motherfucker!
One less nigger.
- Punk motherfucker.
- Fuck him.
Just bust a cap in this old fool now.
No, no, no, no.
Don't be stupid, motherfucker.
Now, let's just get the shit first.
Now, where it's at?
The shit.
Yeah.
Follow me.
Oh, yes.
Yes. Now we gonna get the shit.
Whoo! We gonna get the shit now.
More ring-around-the-rosies, huh?
Oh yeah, the doodoo.
I'm sick of fuckin' with this ass.
Da boopity bop.
We gonna get the shit.
Aw man, they be spiders and shit.
The fuck is this?
Man, ain't this some shit!
You know what?
Right about now, man...
I'm losin' my Patience!
Now, where it's at?
- Huh?
- Handle your business.
Handle your business!
Now, this old man crazy.
Whoo!
What the fuck is wrong with him?
The shit.
- What?
- Uh-huh.
Whoo!
- Where it's at?
- Hmm? Where?
Weird shit, man.
- Man, I don't trust this.
- Hold up!
This old man crazy.
I have it hid!
It's in... the coffins.
Where else...
Would I hide it?
Got the shit!
[ Laughs I sick of playin' these crazy games, old man, with yo ass.
It better be in here.
About fuckin' time!
'Cause you know, I don't wanna hear about another motherfucker.
Holy shit!
What the fuck is this, man?
What's goin' on?
What are we gonna do, bulldog?
I don't know.
Blast him!
What the... oh!
After... you killed crazy K... a few of his boys Killed you.
I guess...
You didn't make it.
No! No! I ain't hearin' this!
No!
What the fuck you tryin' to say?
We're dead, motherfucker?
Very!
Motherfucker, bullshit!
If we dead, then what the fuck we doin' in a funeral home with yo crazy ass, huh?
This...
Ain't no funeral home!
It ain't the terror-dome neither!
Welcome...
To hell... motherfuckers.
Yes!
No!
Every hellspawn all the way back to the primordial past has lost their struggle with the darkness.
Don't give into the demons.
You hear me, soldier?
Don't let the demons take you.
When you pulled that trigger, you made Hell take notice.
Spawn was born on that day.
We were partners, Jess.
From the day we met, my job was to whack you.
- Who gave the order?
- It was Wynn!
I killed him!
Confessions of a fruitcake... probably nothing.
Check the alleys for another body anyway.
Detectives Burke and Williams,
I'm Lisa Wu, "Washington Post."
You're investigating murders committed in the alleys off 42nd Street.
No comment, lady.
Have you found the guns used in the murders?
Get away from me!
A hellspawn can be free of the curse.
How can you know that?
Because I am free.
No!
We've all seen faces that make us turn our heads... people with scars or bad burns.
But what if it went way beyond that?
What if someone had a face so ugly and hideous that even they couldn't bear the sight of themselves?
That's what happened to Al Simmons, now trapped in a burned body that's not even his own, returning for a lover who's now lost.
He remembers the way his wife used to touch him, caress his face, kiss his lips.
He might as well be trapped in a stony tomb... coldness seeping into the bones, all alone, suffocating in the total darkness.
How does one find humanity in an alley?
How does one regain one's soul in an abandoned church?
For this newest hellspawn, this alley is a waystation... his special purgatory.
...in sickness and in health, until death do you part.
He lurks here in the shadows, amid this human debris, waiting... just inside the portal from Hell.
But this is not his domain.
His domain is that burned skin, his shell of necroplasm and the scarlet shroud which hovers around him, protecting him and possessing him at the same time.
Where is the old man?
- Why isn't he here?
- L... I don't know.
He's a ghost like you.
He just appears.
Al, what's happening to your face?
He's laughing at me!
Hey, come on... it's okay, man. It's okay.
Look, it's just the church bells, man.
Come on, it's
Sunday morning.
Stop it!
Leave me alone!
I am still alive.
Did you think you could strike a deal with Malebolgia... and then renege?
This is a graveyard.
I can feel the death.
Yes, look around you.
These artifacts are all that remain from hellspawns of the past.
They were cursed like you.
This is their shrine... a reminder of what may be your fate!
Maybe you're not a crazy old bum.
What do they call you?
I have had many names.
In this time, they call me Cogliostro.
How long have you been hiding here?
Hiding?
I've been here for many years.
You see, I'm the night curator of antiquities.
This is how I have kept these relics safe
- while I waited for you.
- Waited?
In every age a hellspawn is sent.
I tried to guide them, as I've tried to guide you.
But they are lost souls.
I'm not them.
This is your tomb.
What deal did you strike with him?
It was the time of knighthood,
Time of the Mist.
After the endless battles and the slaughter of innocents, it was I who was sent by Malebolgia to collect the souls and ride with them in the air at night... the Ride of the Dead.
But never to die.
There was no honor in that... not for a knight.
My honor had been taken from me.
I turned away from killing.
The Black Arts drew me.
I struggled with the evil inside and used sorcery to free myself.
In that time
I was known as Merlin.
If you are the Black Knight, then I want answers.
Your flesh rebels against you.
The shroud attacks you.
You wallow in self-pity.
Your loss!
I don't want to hear any more talk, old man!
You claim to be some kind of wizard.
Show me what this goddamn shroud is good for!
No.
You will, old man.
This is not the alley, Hellspawn.
I make the rules in this place.
You are in my domain.
They may have taken your honor but they stole my life.
I came back for Wanda.
But she sees me as a monster.
Do you wish to find the answers?
What are you prepared to do?
I am going to get my life back.
If you won't help me, I'll find the answers somewhere else.
One of your officers found a report on a cop killed in the alleys.
Jason, you're a busy man.
Why are you spending your time reading our New York City police reports?
Chief Banks, if I didn't feel you served a purpose for me,
I wouldn't have gotten you nominated for police commissioner and we wouldn't be having this conversation, would we?
Mr. Wynn, l-I didn't mean to imply that...
The report was written by an officer named Max Williams.
Twitch... smart cop, thorough.
His partner is Sam Burke... a meat-and-potatoes guy.
Your smart cop describes the shooting death of one of your best officers, killed in the alleys.
The dying man's last words on earth were
"red cloak"...find the man in the red cloak.
Don't move in on him until you call me.
Consider it done.
The damn thing is no good.
The sights are off or something.
Yes, sir.
Worthless piece of shit.
- It's jammed!
- Fortunately...
I can usually shoot the dick off a squirrel from here.
Look at this junk.
Stupid gun!
Your lack of aim is surely the gun's fault, sir.
- Lack of aim, huh?
- What? You think you can do better?
You know, Twitch, you really lost your sense of humor. You're too serious.
You gotta learn to lighten up a little.
Let's just see now.
Lucky son of a bitch.
Give me that gun.
Burke! I thought they weren't gonna let you back on the range after that incident last week.
Hey, I've been cleared of that one.
It was the guy's fault... he should have ducked.
You're at a disadvantage,
Burke.
Your gut keeps you too far from the target.
Hey, Twitch, I think the Chief just cracked a joke.
All right, this is your report on one of ours that was killed in the alleys?
We closed that case.
It was our collar.
That cop was killed by a crazy priest.
Before he died, that cop said there were two of them.
That leads me to believe that maybe the priest had a playmate.
He also said something about a red cloak.
I remember... that's a detail I shouldn't have missed, Chief.
Get me a perp.
I don't care if you gotta eat, sleep and breathe those alleys.
And I don't care how much shit you step in.
You should feel right at home there, Burke.
Check it out.
You're missing the point, Lisa.
I don't want you to have a good time in New York.
I want you to have a Ionely, exhausting trip, which indicates to me that you're writing a story that will spill a lot of ink.
Let's cut the bullshit.
If I wasn't the best you wouldn't have sent me.
You got a thing for these psychos, Lisa.
You always manage to get close to them.
Yeah, well my job is to hunt them down.
They all give off the same scent.
What scent is that?
Evil.
- Hey, Lisa?
- Yeah?
You're spooky.
Now tell me what you have.
This guy wears a red cloak.
Hey, he's no joke.
He murders people.
I'm gonna find him and deliver to you his head on a platter.
Like doll's eyes.
Fourth time with this zombie and we don't have shit.
The guy has no prints, no name.
And as soon as he starts in about
"the dead guy is back," I'm gone.
I can't do a fifth dance with this twisted sister.
Nice digs.
It's a good thing you're getting some R&R, big guy.
A wallflower, huh?
You see this?
This is a forensic report.
It says that your DNA matches the cells found underneath the nails of a dead bum.
We also have witnesses that say you killed this less fortunate fellow.
We found this nearby.
He's dead.
I saw him burned to a crisp.
But he's back.
That's it, I'm gone.
Come on, Twitch.
Who's back from the dead?
He looked at me with those green eyes.
That cloak... it reached out
- and touched me like it was alive.
- Did you say cloak?
He's gonna drag me back to Hell.
Tell me, who's come from Hell?
Simmons...
Al Simmons.
What the hell are you doing?
Just checking some details, sir.
How's the chili dog?
Kind of light on the onions.
That may signal a slight improvement in air quality.
Yeah yeah yeah... what a comedian.
I'm gonna grab a soda.
You came in looking for me. Why?
Shall we have a seat?
You wrote some articles for "The Washington Post" about a soldier named Al Simmons.
That's old news, detective.
Why the interest?
I was just wondering if you could offer me anything that was too sensitive to put in print.
- Like?
- You tell me.
A member of a special ops group that saved the president a few years back.
But you already knew all that before you came in the door.
I'm like you...
I do my homework.
You know what, Twitch?
I like you.
You're a good cop.
And I'm a good reporter.
And I know a fluff job when I hear it.
So let's cut the bullshit.
You tell me something,
I'll tell you something.
Ladies first.
I wasn't allowed to print the fact that Al Simmons was burned alive on a mission that the NSC says didn't happen.
Your turn.
I'm working the alley murders... looking for a guy with a red cloak.
I have a perp down at Bellevue that says he got a good look at this guy in the alley; says he has a burned face.
Now you tell me Al Simmons was burned alive.
Coincidences do happen.
I don't believe in coincidences.
Thank you for your time, Miss Wu.
I see the way you look when you talk about Al.
You really loved him.
He was my husband.
No, I mean he was "the one."
Is this going to show up in the paper?
This is just you and me.
What you said before about Al... you're right.
He was that one.
Just hearing his voice excited me.
When he touched me... after he died,
I ached for him.
For months I'd sleep with his shirt or his robe... anything that smelled like him.
Mommy, where are you?
Mom? Mommy.
Mommy's in here, sweet girl.
There you are.
Hi, you're a pretty lady.
I remember you.
I've never seen her take to someone so quickly.
You have a way with her.
Is she Al's child?
No...
Al couldn't give us a child.
Oh...
What's happening with the NSC and Terry?
He lost his job.
Come on, Cyan.
- I'm glad he's not there.
- Up, Mommy.
We're a lot better off now.
Hmm...
Jason Wynn will topple off the mountain.
It is just a matter of time, Wanda.
We almost lost everything. And I still can't get Terry to talk about it.
He stays away for days at a time.
Maybe he's protecting you.
Sometimes the truth is brutal.
It's driving us apart.
Something's wrong.
But he won't let me inside.
Maybe you haven't grieved Al's death.
Do you sometimes feel that he's still with you?
You've seen him, haven't you?
The creature?
Twice.
I've seen what he's capable of and I haven't told anyone.
You know who it is, don't you?
He spoke my name.
There was something in his voice.
I think you should go now.
If you can hear me, Al,
I know you're with me.
I feel it.
Wanda.
I'm hungry, Mama.
I ask you to step out where I can see you... very respectfully.
I warned the last cop not to come into my alley.
Are you threatening me?
What would you do about it?
I'd shoot you between the eyes.
Did you kill him... the police officer?
You got some hard bark on you for a little guy.
No, I didn't kill him.
Murders have occurred in this alley.
One victim was a homeless man.
We have a suspect who wears a skull face... a ritual of some kind.
Chapel... I left him alive for you.
This man you call Chapel... we have him locked away.
He's quite completely insane.
So naturally when he described you,
- we didn't believe it.
- You believed it. You're here.
He claims you're Al Simmons, a soldier who was burned alive five years ago.
What do you think?
I think you've somehow survived a government cover-up.
You're closer than you think.
Can you get me closer?
You want to be a knight in shining armor?
Go play cops and robbers.
Forget all about this.
I wouldn't wanna see your body dumped in my alley.
Confirm Chapel's involvement.
Chapel was just a puppet.
The NSC was pulling the strings.
Who's the puppet master?
What difference does it make?
Do you think you can stop them, little man?
I can do my best.
You were a soldier once... a hero to your country.
What happened to your code of honor?
When you play with matches, you can get burned.
Don't come down to these alleys again.
One of your officers has accessed some of my files,
Chief Banks. Why?
I don't know anything about it.
The only guy here capable of doing that would be Twitch...
Officer Williams.
You asked about him before.
He's working on the killings in the alley.
Find out what he knows.
And after I get the information from Officer Williams?
I understand that New York's Finest who are killed in the line of duty are given quite a hero's burial.
Just tell me where to send the flowers, Chief Banks.
I spoke with the red-cloaked man here in this place.
I believe he's still somewhere in these alleys.
Okay, I'm gonna take a look around, check it out.
This goes all the way up to a high official in the NSC.
And who would this official be?
The only man who can make decisions at this level is Jason Wynn.
My instinct is that the suspect we have down at Bellevue is one of his assassins.
That's quite a story, Twitch.
It sounds like you have a very solid lead.
You've done well, officer.
The department is proud of you.
Thank you, sir.
Officer down!
Get a goddamn ambulance down here!
Jesus, he's bleeding hard from his head.
Officer down! Do you hear me,
God damn it?
Twitch is down!
Gypsy caravan.
Honest-to-God Gypsies.
Do I?
- Do I have to?
- Oh, yes.
Well?
Billy, you were 297 last week.
It takes some time for these diets to work.
Heidi, what are you doing to me?
- Good morning.
- What you wanted me to do to you... in the backseat of your father's car.
I'm proving my love.
- You gonna get Mr. Mafia off today?
- Please don't call him that.
It's bad enough your father's defending him. Jokes I can do without.
You'll say this is justice.
Keep it up,
I'll take your video card away.
You would not.
Try me, sweetheart.
- I'm glad you two think this is funny.
- Come on.
I wouldn't have taken Ginelli's case unless I was convinced of his innocence.
Maybe. This time.
There's my ride.
I go to wipe out
Tataglia's inert science.
Bye. Love you.
The defense calls Max Duggenfield to the stand.
Your Honor, I object.
Considering the fact that the defendant... is accused of ordering
Mr. Duggenfield's death...
Mr. Halleck, are you sure you want this witness to testify?
If Max Duggenfield feels... my client paid $40,000 to have him killed...
I want to hear him state it in open court.
Call Max Duggenfield to the stand.
Mr. Max Duggenfield, please.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Remember about that detective agency?
- So this is really about...
- Pulling your ass out of the fire.
Please raise your right hand.
Do you swear to the tell the truth, so help you God?
- I do.
- State your name for the record.
Max Duggenfield.
Mr. Duggenfield.
Anybody else out there... who might want to see you dead?
- Maybe. Possibly.
- To your knowledge... has there ever been a price on your head before?
Well...
- Three years ago...
- Who was it?
Who took a contract out on your life three years ago?
- Objection!
- Overruled.
Well, it was my wife.
She got feisty this one time.
The P. M. S. Thing maybe.
You know how they get.
Then there was this money matter...
Your Honor...
Now that she's gone through the change... everything is beautiful.
Grazie, Mama.
Guillermo... grazie.
- Just doing my job.
- Fuck that.
I owe you a big one, William.
Listen.
I know you had to lobby
Mr. Lily-White-Collar-Partner... to take this case, so...
What this is really all about is...
Even after I'm done paying your firm a fucking fortune...
I'm still gonna owe you, big time.
Mangia!
Play with fire?
You got it, mister.
You tried the rest, now try the best.
What you think?
Come on, everybody! It's fun!
They're coming this afternoon to fix the elevator.
And congratulations.
You made the noon news.
Hey, Billy, you pulled it off.
I never would have believed it possible.
Kirk Penschley proves once again... without faith, good deeds are dead.
Hey, kiddo, you gotta take a few pounds off there.
Come on.
I want to show you something.
Have you looked across the street this morning?
Check this out.
Do you see that Gypsy piece of ass down there?
How can I miss her?
All right. Give her this quarter, tell her to raise her skirt.
- Didn't your prick escape sixth grade?
- I hope not.
What's the matter?
Afraid she heard you?
I'm taking the afternoon off.
- Say "Good afternoon, Billy. "
- Good afternoon, Billy.
Don't forget tonight at the club.
We'll celebrate.
What's taking Hopley so long?
- They should have been out hours ago.
- Hi, Judge.
I want to thank you for turning me on to that detective agency.
- It won me a big case this morning.
- Forget that.
We've been invaded by a bunch of filthy, thieving Gypsies.
I don't know, Judge.
They bring a little fun.
They bring disease, crime and prostitution.
- What fun is that?
- Who's the old guy?
Their chief. Named Lempke.
- At last. Good riddance.
- Not yet.
They've rented some land at Lars Ancaster's farm.
You can't drive them off private property.
Yes, you can. Unless you want the high school football team down with the clap.
They make their money on dog fights!
Hey, Judge, no problem.
To Dell Barton
Investigative Services... the best in New England.
And to winning.
May it ever be so sweet.
Here, here.
Easy, boy.
Down, boy.
No, no, no. No, no.
No way, my hero.
We're out of here before you explode.
- The party is over. Let's go.
- Can you get the cars?
I'll get the car. We'll pick up a pound cake on the way out.
No, no, no.
- You've got to stop eating like that.
- I know.
Billy, I want you to stop digging your grave... with a spoon and fork.
I love you.
Otherwise, I'd keep my mouth shut.
I can't help it, Heidi.
All I think about is food.
Maybe I ought to help you try to think about something else.
Heidi.
Still thinking about food?
I want you fill this... for my nose.
- What you look at?
- Nothing. Nothing.
Go ahead.
There's so much more to life than food.
- Just...
- What?
Just don't stop.
Don't stop what?
- Please.
- Please what?
Please, please, please.
Papa, it is cold.
I'll go get my coat.
God!
- How come you get a trial so quick?
- It isn't a trial.
It's a coroner's inquest, a much simpler proceeding.
But it was an accident.
So what's the worst that could happen?
Nothing will happen to your father, Linda.
- He didn't do anything wrong.
- So you'll totally get off?
There's nothing to "get off" from.
I didn't do anything wrong.
An accident is not a crime.
You saw the old woman leave the store, Mr. Bangor.
- She was running?
- I guess so. They were stealing.
Yes, but she was running?
That's what I want to establish.
I can't say for sure.
I was in the back of the pharmacy...
That will be all, Mr. Bangor.
You may step down.
Chief Hopley.
Chief, perhaps you can help us.
Was Mr. Halleck traveling within the legal speed limit?
Yes, sir.
We have witnesses... and his skid marks confirmed that.
Was he Breathalyzed?
Yes, sir.
Results?
Well, sir, Mr. Halleck was as sober as a judge, Judge.
Under the circumstances,
I'll let that go.
You are dismissed, Chief.
This court finds no grounds on which to charge William Halleck... in the death of Suzanne Lempke, which is hereby ruled accidental.
This hearing is closed.
- You drive.
- Mm-hmm.
Sir?
Thinner.
Get in the car.
283. Somebody call Richard Simmons.
- Did you weigh yourself?
283. No fooling?
No fooling.
That is 14 pounds in seven days.
- Congratulations.
- Yeah, not bad, huh?
You look slimmer.
I haven't seen you stop eating.
- Maybe it's guilt.
- That's stupid.
It hasn't affected my diet any more than it's affected yours.
Ahhh!
- Why did I come out here today?
- For the exercise.
From the looks of you, it's finally doing some good.
There's nothing like avoiding a manslaughter charge... to turn a man's life around.
That's witty, Kirk, and compassionate too.
- What did he say?
- Foot-in-mouth disease.
That kind of attitude could cost you court cases... especially in my court.
You leave me alone, or I'll get Billy to run you over in that golf cart.
- Kirk.
- What?
Give me a little kiss, sweetheart.
Right here.
Billy, have you lost your mind?
That's surprisingly easy to do once you've lost a few pounds.
Come on.
Mike, look at this, would you?
- Your psoriasis is coming back.
- Why?
"Why ask why?"
As they say on TV.
Stress probably.
Use that ointment from last time.
- Hey!
- For horses. Better for cows.
I've lost two pounds since this morning?
Is that possible?
Relax. Soon you'll be able to see your balls without using a mirror.
Listen, Cary...
I never really thanked you for taking care of me.
Never told you what happened right after that, did I?
Leda and I went to lunch.
When we came out, that old gyp was waiting for me.
- The one with the...
- Yeah, him.
He walked up and touched me, right here.
Did he say anything?
How the hell should I know?
I was worried I might catch impetigo from him.
Or lice!
- I want you to go off this diet.
- Does it look like I'm on a diet?
When did you stop?
About a week ago.
That's another 25 pounds.
That's over 40 pounds in two weeks?
Make up your mind.
Do you want me fat or thin?
I just...
I was thinking that sudden weight loss is an early warning sign of...
- Of what?
- You know what.
Christ! If I gain weight,
I have a heart attack.
If I lose weight,
I have cancer.
I can't win.
I ran into Mike Houston yesterday.
He wants you to take a few tests.
All right.
If you don't want to do it for yourself, and you don't want to do it for me... will you do it for Linda?
Everything's fine.
- "Fine"?
- Yeah.
Your blood work is five by five.
That's better than mine, in fact.
Let's see, cholesterol and triglycerides are both down.
You haven't been this healthy since you banged Mary Lou Singer in high school.
Sangster, and I never got into her pants.
Mike, are you sure about this?
I weigh 240 pounds. I've lost the equivalent of a fucking suitcase.
Look, Billy... the important thing here is for you to relax.
Just stop thinking about this.
Your weight will stabilize, and you'll gain some back.
Believe me, everything is gonna be all right.
Mr. Halleck!
I see you finally found a diet that works.
You look wonderful.
Right, and I... want a whole new wardrobe to go with my new look, so you might want to...
Well, let's do it!
You're down to a pant 40.
Maybe even 38.
That can't be right.
Do you have a scale?
This diet you're on... what is it?
I've tried all the others.
I might as well try this one.
I don't think you'd like it, Henry.
In fact,
I don't think you'd like it at all.
Dad.
Can I ask you a question?
Is there such a thing as, like, male menopause?
- I mean, hormones that, like...
- What are you trying to say?
I'm worried about you.
What's there to worry about?
I found a diet that works.
Eat all you want and still lose the weight.
- What happened?
- I don't know. I must've said something.
Don't. You'll only upset her more.
There.
Billy, will you please slow down?
Why are you eating like that?
I don't know if it's all in my head.
- Dr. Mikey thinks it is.
- I hate when you call him that.
I do know one thing: I've lost three pounds a day every day until today.
You're putting weight back on?
That's wonderful.
Today, I skipped lunch.
Instead of being three pounds lighter... when I got home from the office,
I'm six pounds lighter.
You see, I have to eat like this.
It's a race, and I'm losing.
- You sound mean, as if it's my fault.
- I'm sorry.
Was I giving myself a blow job just then?
That is a horrible thing to say.
I don't remember you complaining about it at the time.
Linda should go visit her Aunt Rhoda for a few weeks.
- What?
- She can't watch you go through this.
It's tearing her apart.
Look at what just happened.
I'll drive her there tomorrow.
Billy. Finally got through to that specialist.
And?
Good news. Based on your test results and what I've told him... it's definitely not a parasite.
Not a tapeworm.
- What does he recommend?
- The Glassman Clinic.
They're expecting you tomorrow.
And, Billy, even if you don't want to go... you have to, for Heidi's sake.
She's upset.
Mike.
Leda was eating alone again last night.
Is the judge sick?
Out of town.
His sister was in a pretty bad car accident.
Cary Rossington doesn't have a sister.
Then it was Leda's sister.
You have to relax.
See you tomorrow.
Leda.
Is Cary in?
He's in Minnesota visiting relatives.
What's wrong with him?
Has he lost weight?
What are you talking about?
I've lost 100 pounds.
That's spelled with a one and two zeroes.
It was the Gypsies, wasn't it?
What do you mean, "Gypsies"?
Did the old man touch you?
What does that have to do with...
Come on in, Billy.
Here. You'll need this.
He is in Minnesota... but he's not visiting relatives.
He's at the Mayo Clinic.
Leda... there's no such thing as Gypsy curses.
You trying to convince me or yourself?
He came up to us as we were coming out of La Zuppas, that place over in Milton.
Cary was hunting for his keys.
He never saw the old man coming.
I did. I tried to warn him, but I was too late.
He touched him.
Then he whispered something in his ear.
Cary claims he didn't hear what it was.
I heard.
What?
What did he say?
One word.
Lizard.
His skin was plating, turning into scales.
It's evolution in reverse.
A sideshow freak.
Lord Jesus.
He chartered a plane to take him to the Mayo.
Did I tell you that? He can't bear to have people look at him.
At the end, before he left, his hands were like claws!
His eyes were just two bright little specks inside these deep hollows.
Like pieces of tin foil!
And his nose...
I have to go to the Glassman Clinic.
I have a metabolic disorder.
Why did you come here?
Why are you looking for my husband?
I just wanted to compare notes.
God. What did he say to you?
- What did the old gyp say to you?
- Nothing!
I don't believe that.
I believe it's all your fault.
You hit that old lady!
You were the one that hit her!
You! Not Cary!
I wrote on the fence, but your husband slapped on the whitewash.
He was too happy to do it.
Have a nice stay at the Glassman, Billy.
I hear the food's good.
There's no such thing as a Gypsy curse.
You come back in another couple of weeks... after you've lost another 40 or 50 pounds!
Tell me what you believe then!
Yes, you tell me what you believe then!
You hear me?
You tell me what you believe then!
You tell me!
- You gave me that.
- I did?
Mr. Ginelli, it's Billy Halleck for you.
- What can I do for you?
- I got a crazy question for you.
Go ahead, Counselor.
Do you believe Gypsies can curse people?
I tend to believe what my friends tell me and what I can see.
My mother is a different story.
Hold on.
Si.
She says she believes.
She knew Gypsies in the old country.
She says whoever puts it on has to take it off. No one else can.
No one else.
What's this all about?
I'll get back to you. Thank you.
What happened at the Rossington's last night?
Leda Rossington thinks that old Gypsy,
Tadzu Lempke, put a curse on Cary and I.
What?
I know how it sounds, but that's what she thinks.
You see...
Cary has this skin cancer...
Billy, there is no such thing as a Gypsy curse.
Even if there were, it wouldn't just be you and Cary that Lempke would curse.
It would be the entire town.
Yeah?
The whole town didn't kill his wife and then try and cover it up.
It was me and Cary and...
What?
It would be Hopley too.
He was in on the cover-up.
Billy... all you have to do right now... is to think about checking yourself into the clinic and getting better.
That's all.
Look out!
We're here.
Hopley, answer, damn it.
- Good morning, Mr. Halleck.
- Morning.
We've used the computer to synthesize your test results.
Amazing.
Over 12,000 calories a day, and you continue to lose weight.
Here you are.
Extra whipped cream, just as you specified.
We have some good protocols.
They'll take a week or two to work out.
What if that doesn't tell you anything?
We'll keep running tests.
We won't give up.
Rest assured of that.
- Where are you going?
- To get some takeout.
Duncan, it's Billy Halleck.
The guy at the station house said you were home sick.
You okay?
Come on, Duncan.
I know about the judge.
What's happened to you?
I don't really think you want to know... but come on in.
So... now Rossington looks like what he was all along.
That's funny.
And look at you.
You finally found a diet that works.
Whatever we did, we don't deserve this.
No? You ran the old lady down.
Rossington fixed it so points weren't even taken off your driving record.
And I just ran the whole pack of them out of the county.
Come on. I'm not a criminal.
I wasn't drunk.
How would I know?
I didn't give you a Breathalyzer test.
I said I did.
That's just the way we do things here in Fairview, isn't it?
What the hell.
- Old lady was jaywalking.
- I wasn't drunk.
Maybe there was something else going on, though.
- Like what?
- Never mind.
I want to find the old guy and tell him we don't deserve this.
You think he put a curse on you?
Good old-fashioned Gypsy curse, like in Shock Theater?
Does it matter?
I have some things to say to him.
Maybe you want to come with me?
Christ, Hopley.
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.
Yours is just a little slower.
You'll get there eventually.
I am not going anywhere.
You find him, Billy.
You find him.
When you do...
I want you to kill that old bastard and say it's from me.
I can't.
I can't kill him.
I need him to take the curse off.
He's the only one who can, I think.
You think he'll take it off?
Are you gonna snivel up to him and say, "I'm so sorry"?
Look how sorry I am!
Don't be stupid!
Take the gun! Go on.
Take it.
Take the gun.
Take the gun.
Take the goddamn gun!
Take the gun!
Shoot him!
It's the only satisfaction you'll get,
'cause he'll never take the curse off!
Never!
Never!
Mike Houston was here.
Why did you leave the clinic?
Billy?
Are you all right?
Fine.
We care about you, sweetheart.
I care about you.
Linda.
The doctors at the Glassman Clinic can't help me.
If they can't help you, who do you think can?
I saw Duncan Hopley before I came home.
He offered to give me his gun.
I didn't take it.
- Thank God!
- I probably should have, though.
I heard a gunshot after I left.
Maybe Duncan saw a rat and decided to do a little brain surgery on it... but I don't think so.
Lempke cursed him too.
His face...
Please. Please! Please don't go through that curse thing again!
What else can it be?
I'm not on a diet!
It's not anorexia!
I don't have a tapeworm!
I've been eating like mad for six weeks!
12,000 calories a day, at least!
And I'm still losing weight!
I'm being erased.
What about the Glassman?
They keep calling me about you.
Forget the Glassman.
Heidi told me what you said about this curse thing.
Tells you a lot, doesn't she?
Whispers little secrets in your ear.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Forget it.
All you need to remember is it's not "a thing. "
It's a fact, a curse.
If you don't believe me, ask Rossington.
Heidi told me what you said about him, so I called Leda.
He's got skin cancer.
He's being treated.
Skin cancer, my ass.
You are running out of time.
No shit. In two weeks, I won't be able to go to the bathroom by myself.
- You have to go back to the clinic.
- Wrong.
I have to find those Gypsies.
- Do you see what I'm talking about?
- Yeah, I think he's in trouble.
He's very irrational.
If I were you...
Oh, Mike.
Tadzu Lempke.
Their king. Also, father of the woman you struck with your car.
Father?
That's impossible.
That woman was old: 75, 80.
Lempke is 106.
This is his great-granddaughter and her husband.
He claimed to be 29 when he entered the country from Europe in 1917.
You figure it out.
You want to talk about where they're going?
Okay.
I tracked them to Raintree.
Then Milford.
Then Greenough, which I had never heard of.
Where do you think they're headed now?
Headed up the Maine coast.
They're always in Bar Harbor at the end of the season. Pick them up there.
I don't have that much time.
I have the order.
All you have to do is sign it.
To sign it?
I don't know.
Maybe you're right.
I know you don't want to, but it's best for both of us.
If we take legal action, what will he do when he finds out?
What kind of legal action?
The kind that forces you back to the
Glassman Clinic before it's too late.
Okay.
I'll go back.
Oh, Billy!
I am so happy.
Dear Heidi,
I'm going after Lempke.
The old guy knows what I did, but not what you did.
That frees you up to believe the curse is in my head.
Unfortunately, that's a luxury
I no longer have. I'll work it out.
In the meantime, if there's anything going on between you and Dr. Mikey... end it, immediately.
Billy.
Biff Quigley.
Call me Biff. Mind telling me why you want to know where they went?
- Yes, Biff, I mind.
- Fine.
Bill?
A man's reasons ought to be his own.
Good. Now, since we agree on all that...
But it's still going to cost you $800.
- What?
- The info is a freebie.
The $800 is for the info...
I don't give your wife and doctor.
Do you take travelers' checks?
Gotcha.
Come let the Gypsy king guess your weight and tell your fate.
Don't be shy.
The old man, he knows everything.
He can see everything.
Don't bother to step on the scale.
I can tell your weight from right here.
159, right?
And next week... gonna be 143.
And the week after that...
Ooh!
We don't like to think about that, do we, mister?
Sorry, mister, but you lose.
But let's see.
No.
Ah, yes.
You can have a prize anyway.
Haaah!
Haaah!
Billy, get in, you idiot!
Cary?
Hey-ah!
You ready, Billy? You and I are gonna get that Gypsy bastard!
What are you doing?
I'm saving you, Billy.
Isn't that what you want?
Hold on, partner!
Leda, this is Billy Halleck.
Can I speak with Cary, please?
Sorry, Billy. Cary can't come to the phone right now.
Yesterday he drove his Lincoln into a gas truck.
A happy ending of sorts.
He always did want to be cremated.
I'm sorry, Leda.
Excuse me.
You seen this man?
His name's Tadzu Lempke.
Taddy Lempke?
I knew he was around.
- You know Lempke?
- How could you forget him?
Big, black cancer in the middle of his face.
I hadn't seen him since I worked the Ferris wheel... ten, maybe twenty years ago.
But it was him last night.
You know what he said to me?
"Hey, Flash.
Where that pretty little wife of yours?
Well, don't matter.
You'll see her soon. "
Mister, my wife has been dead for five years... and he knew it.
Did you see which way the Gypsies went when they left here?
No, but I heard them.
You can't miss the sound of those old beaters they drive.
Out 27, then north on 1.
Listen. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Mister, be careful.
That Taddy will chew you up and swallow you down.
Yes?
Linda.
Daddy, where are you?
I've been so worried.
It's good to hear your voice.
When did you get home?
Yesterday.
Mom's really upset.
Where is she now?
She's in the kitchen with Dr. Houston.
What's Dr. Mikey doing there?
- He's been here a lot. Why?
- Billy, is that you?
Sweetheart, I've been talking to Mike, and he's been saying that...
Bitch! Bitch!
This is all your fault, you bitch!
For shame! My mama!
I say you killed my own mama!
I say you are a demon, and we should kill you!
Is that what I am to you?
A demon?
Look at me.
She call you the white man from town.
You got no business with us... and we got no business with you.
Go away.
I'm not through with you.
Your daughter ran out between two parked cars.
I couldn't see her.
Why wasn't you watching, white man from town?
Why wasn't you watching?
You never see us!
- Cha!
- Fa!
Doing this to me won't bring your daughter back.
Duncan Hopley is dead.
So is Cary Rossington.
Neither of them brought your daughter back.
Justice ain't about bringing back the dead, white man.
Justice is about justice!
Your friends, the policeman and the judge... make sure nothing happen to you, they keep you safe.
But I make sure something happen to them.
That justice, white man.
Gypsy justice.
You know as much about justice as I know about turbine engines.
Now take your fucking curse off of me!
I never take it off.
I die with it in me mouth.
I'm sorry.
It was my fault.
Please.
I'm asking you nicely.
Take it off before this goes any further.
Get out or I make it worse.
I make it so much worse, you think I bless you the first time.
Like this.
Okay, I'll go... but not before I curse you... and everybody I see by the light of this fire!
The curse of the white man from town!
That's right, laugh.
Laugh now, cry later... when this all is at your feet!
You want to see what the white man from town can do... when he puts his mind to it?
Don't make me start, old man!
Don't make me start!
Take it off while you still can!
Get out of here!
Leave this camp, murdering bastard!
Look at this!
The curse of the white man from town... is on you, pal.
They don't write about it in books, but it is on you.
This is Billy Halleck.
- Can I speak to Richie Ginelli?
- Hold on.
William.
How you doing, Counselor?
Not so good, Richie.
I need a doctor.
I'll have someone to you by morning.
Not a doctor, but he's pretty close.
Ball bearing, huh?
First for me.
This kind of pain is a first for me.
There's a reason for that.
I've worked with cadavers that looked better than you do.
These are mine, but you need them more than I do.
Potassium tablets.
Will they do anything for the pain?
No.
They'll prevent you from going into cardiac arrest.
Look, if it's a diet, you can come off it now.
You have my permission.
Expect a visitor tomorrow.
Who?
Take the Bufferin and get some rest.
You should have called me earlier,
Billy. A lot earlier.
I didn't expect you to come yourself.
Hey, I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
Okay, I got it.
Fuck.
Fuck!
Who was I kidding?
You ever hear of something called "committal in absentia"?
Sure.
It means somebody's committed to a mental hospital without being examined.
It's usually invoked when some guy goes loony and runs off.
Christ.
Houston couldn't have done it without Heidi.
Damn them.
Damn them both.
Her and this doctor, you don't think...
Yeah. Sure.
I didn't want to believe it... until one night I saw his car pulling out of the driveway.
She said he just dropped by.
Hey, relax.
You got nothing to worry about.
By the time the order goes through, this will either be over... or you'll be dead.
If you make it, you can deal with them at your leisure.
I'm gonna get you for this, Heidi.
I swear I am.
Richie.
You're not actually gonna hurt anybody, are you?
No.
But, Billy, if I'm gonna help you... you can't ask that question again.
Hey, hey, hey.
What do you say, fellas?
Do I smell like a gyp?
Who wants a little strychnine?
Here you go.
Here you go.
Hey, kid, wake up.
It's a visit from the money fairy.
What's your name?
Spurton. Frank Spurton.
Okay, Frank Spurton.
Check it out.
I don't do nothing that goes on video.
That's a good plan, Stan.
Listen. There's some Gypsies camped out up the road.
They light, you call me.
Who do I ask for in case someone else answers?
Don't worry.
I'll answer.
- You like this, don't you?
- Like it? Are you kidding?
I fuckin' love it!
- Yeah.
- They're at a small farm off Route 92.
I think they made me.
If I were you, friend,
I'd get out of there as soon as I could.
And lose my number.
Thanks.
Well, well, well.
Hey, Billy.
I think it's time for us to move on.
- This is getting out of hand.
- Wrong.
This has been out of hand... ever since that old gyp touched you.
I'm just the guy to put it back "in hand. "
I gotta show them they can't get away with that stuff... they pulled on that kid.
He was a mook, but he was my mook.
Richie the Hammer.
Please don't.
There! Over there!
No!
Nooo!
No!
Gabe!
No, Gabe!
No!
- Yes?
- F. B. I.
Special Agent Stoner.
I have a few questions, Mrs. Grimani.
Can you identify...
That pig killed my old mama!
- He killed my husband.
- Mr. William Halleck?
Was it him at this camp last night?
No, but we believe he hired someone to make the attack.
We have him in custody.
Would you mind accompanying me to identify him personally?
My God.
Not again.
He's waiting in the car.
There is no car here.
I almost forgot.
I have a photo of the man we suspect attacked your camp.
It was you!
Acid, bitch.
You scream again, and I'll kill you.
You just got a face full of soda pop and baking soda.
Billy, get out!
Richie, no!
This time you live because my friend asks.
Next time, you're one dead little whore.
Fuck you.
And fuck him!
Now... here's the real deal.
Now here's what I want you to do.
Unless you want to wear a Gypsy scarf... over your face for the rest of your life... hold very still!
Tell the old gyp to meet me at the lighthouse in two hours.
Your friend is a pig!
He will die thin!
But you will die first, you bastard!
He'll meet you there in about an hour, over by that bench.
Thanks, Richie.
You want to thank me?
Get that old bastard.
Wake up.
Wake up.
Your dreams smell bad to me.
They stink.
Maybe you think you're still dreaming, huh?
Does this look like dream to you, white man from town?
You kill my daughter, and you get off.
For that you deserve to die, so I curse you!
But now, I got to do this so your crazy friend... don't hurt my Galina.
Already he kill her husband.
You want your little girl hurt?
I didn't want any of this.
You want to get rid of the curse?
First, you've got to give it... to this pie.
Then you give this pie...
With the curse inside, to somebody else.
Okay.
You gain weight quick now.
So quick, you don't know what's going on.
But somebody... got to eat this pie soon.
Everyone who eat pie die quick and bad.
You got somebody?
Yes.
Yeah, you got somebody.
But why you don't do right?
Eat your own pie.
You die thin, but you die clean.
Get away from me.
Our business is done.
Die clean, white man from town.
Die clean.
- Daddy, are you okay?
- I'm still thin, but I'll be fine.
Listen.
Daddy's coming home tonight... but I want it to be a surprise, okay?
Yeah. Sure.
- I want you to stay at Georgia's.
- Daddy, no!
Yes.
There are some things...
I need to talk to your mother about.
Promise you'll stay at Georgia's.
- All right.
- Thanks, honey.
Let me talk with your mother.
Billy, is that you?
There are some things I have to do before I come home.
I'll see you in a couple of days.
Wake up... white woman from town.
Oh, Billy.
Oh, Billy! Oh!
Whoa. At least wait until I get up to 140.
I didn't expect you home until the end of the week.
I couldn't wait to see you.
I even brought you a present.
It's on the kitchen counter.
I know why you came home early.
I know what you've been thinking.
I swear there's never been anything between Mike Houston and me.
We can talk about it in the morning.
I'm gonna go upstairs.
I'm exhausted.
All right.
- I'm going with you.
- No, no.
It's early.
Why don't you check out what I brought you?
You're gonna like it.
You sound like your old silly self.
I'm starting to feel like my old silly self again.
- Take a look.
- It's in there?
Go. Go.
Is it strawberry?
Uh-huh.
Oh, Billy, that's my favorite.
I know.
Getting even is also what it's all about, you bitch.
Heidi?
Heidi.
You awake?
Did you try it?
Yep. You tried it.
Strawberry pie.
Mmm.
I wouldn't want to eat too much of it myself, though.
It's diet food.
Look at you.
Size six again.
Maybe even a size four.
Daddy!
You look so thin, but I'm glad to see you anyway.
I'm sorry I didn't stay at Georgia's... but I needed to talk to Mom before I saw you.
Things haven't been great between us... because of what you've been going through.
So I came back after you went to sleep.
We worked things out.
And I just had a piece of your pie for breakfast.
- You had...
- Yes, Dad. It was delicious.
And things are cool between Mom and I.
I have to play soccer with Lisa, but I'll catch you later.
Bye. Love you.
My God, what have I done?
Billy, you're home.
Dr. Mikey.
Early for a house call, isn't it?
It's not what you think.
Heidi was upset.
I just stopped by to see how she was doing.
Don't sweat it. I might have done the same thing in your shoes.
After all,
I was acting like a jerk.
But I'm fine now.
Even put a little weight back on.
I was just digging into a slice of this breakfast pie.
- Care to join me?
- I really shouldn't.
Come on, Mike.
I've settled everything with Heidi.
Now it's your turn.
The pie's delicious.
You sure I'm not intruding?
Positive... white doctor from town.

{138}{185}...Irish Sea...
{190}{233}...Bering Sea.
{505}{554}Mrs. Baran fainted! Let's go.
{629}{675}-Get a doctor!|-I'll go!
{1006}{1095}The doctor's worried about you.|He thinks it's serious.
{1101}{1138}Where's the body?
{1148}{1203}Someone moved it, that's apparent.
{1208}{1262}Someone saw us put it in?
{1284}{1338}Well, I don't know. Maybe.
{1395}{1429}We must find him.
{1440}{1466}No, Mia.
{1471}{1577}Stick to our story. It's better|this way. We don't know where he is.
{1582}{1646}He'll turn up.|If he doesn't, all the better.
{1651}{1716}Okay? Did you take your|heart medicine? No.
{1730}{1826}We must act naturally.|You must ask about Guy.
{1831}{1935}Be concerned, like you would be|if he was really missing.
{2074}{2145}-What?|-His suit.
{2321}{2360}Oh, my God.
{2828}{2910}4 x 6 color prints.|Can I have those in 20 minutes?
{3404}{3434}Ask her.
{3619}{3692}Tell her if she sees anything,|to call us.
{3916}{3946}He's disappeared.
{4394}{4459}Let's just get these|and get out of here.
{4914}{5001}Someone's watching us.|Someone with Guy's camera.
{5255}{5348}-You need to eat, honey.|-I'm not hungry, thank you.
{5353}{5392}He is dead, Mia.
{5449}{5529}He is dead. We killed him.|You saw him die.
{5623}{5659}What about the pictures?
{5664}{5736}Someone took them before he was killed.
{5770}{5821}-Right?|-Who?
{5827}{5900}We'll know when they start|blackmailing us.
{5916}{5947}He's dead.
{5952}{5994}This is another thing.
{6021}{6073}I didn't tell you something.
{6138}{6169}Open it.
{6279}{6352}It's the school accounts.|That's why there's no money.
{6358}{6476}It was for Guy and me. He told me|someone stole it, but I found it.
{6488}{6529}You killed him for money.
{6534}{6597}Believe me, it wasn't the only reason.
{6631}{6683}There's $50,000 there, Mia.
{6688}{6716}We'll split it.
{6721}{6796}Use it to pay for your damn|fried chicken.
{6830}{6874}I can go to the police.
{6888}{6947}I can tell them what we did.
{6956}{6997}What you did.
{7004}{7048}We both did it.
{7053}{7126}They won't see that as|beneficial to me.
{7131}{7227}They'll say the wife gets the|school, the money, her freedom.
{7232}{7287}What does the other woman get?
{7292}{7372}Nothing.|That's how they'll look at it.
{7519}{7570}I'll say we were lovers.
{7575}{7651}You can take the girl|out of the convent....
{7684}{7742}I thought we had the same reason.
{7762}{7822}We did have the same reason.
{7840}{7888}I just had an extra one.
{7945}{8058}I'm sorry I lied to you.|I couldn't do it now.
{8110}{8169}If you hadn't found this...
{8184}{8287}...you killed the person who|could tell you where it was.
{8308}{8358}He said we were partners...
{8364}{8422}...and then he acted alone.
{9497}{9561}-Where're you going?|-I must go.
{9565}{9617}What are you talking about?
{9673}{9788}This was under my door this morning.|It's over. He's been found.
{9805}{9902}It's Sunbury, 20 miles from here.|How would he get there?
{9908}{9980}Someone took him from the pool|to the river.
{9985}{10086}We should call the police and|file a missing persons report.
{10092}{10127}I must go. It's him.
{10133}{10177}I'll go too.
{10567}{10640}No, I'll wait. Fine.
{10646}{10714}-Wait in there.|-No, I'll be fine.
{10738}{10807}Just don't let him forget me.
{10820}{10867}You're not gonna light that?
{10872}{10933}You can light these in America?
{10939}{11012}I'm quitting. Nicorette.
{11078}{11115}Excuse me...
{11126}{11174}...my husband is missing.
{11228}{11275}I think this might be him.
{11281}{11330}-How long?|-Four days.
{11337}{11417}-You file a missing persons report?|-No.
{11452}{11525}He has left before|without telling you?
{11531}{11577}The description fits.
{11609}{11689}-John Doe, 180 pounds, six foot even?|-Right.
{11694}{11781}-Describe his clothes.|-It says the body was naked.
{11787}{11847}We don't tell the press everything.
{11853}{11928}I didn't see him the day|he disappeared.
{11933}{11976}Any jewelry?
{11982}{12027}A wedding ring, that's all.
{12043}{12094}He doesn't always wear that.
{12119}{12161}Can I see the body?
{12207}{12268}-Appendectomy scar?|-No.
{12316}{12372}I see. No.
{12408}{12439}Hold on.
{12467}{12563}Howie, I think Mrs. Doe is here.
{12897}{12969}Prepare yourself.|The sand does a lot of damage.
{13058}{13112}Oh, my God.
{13132}{13182}Is that your husband, ma'am?
{13243}{13277}No.
{13445}{13472}Poor kid.
{13478}{13557}Wasn't her husband.|Never saw him before.
{14118}{14152}Excuse me?
{14161}{14196}Mrs. Baran?
{14202}{14262}-Who are you?|-Forgive me for intruding.
{14289}{14319}Sit down.
{14399}{14437}Coffee, please.
{14490}{14602}I saw you at the sheriff's.|I got your name off the view request.
{14607}{14644}Shirley Vogel.
{14687}{14721}You're the police?
{14743}{14798}Cagney and Lacey|kind of thing.
{14804}{14893}They met with me once.|Research stuff. Nice girls.
{14913}{14957}I say "girls," is that okay?
{14969}{15099}Anyway, flash forward 10 years.|I'm on medical leave. The big C.
{15105}{15130}Air.
{15151}{15176}I'm sorry.
{15182}{15226}Whatever. I knew it was coming.
{15232}{15316}With my family, never two boobs|in a coffin.
{15321}{15394}I'm sorry, but why are you here?
{15407}{15457}Remember your husband?
{15514}{15583}Could I get some coffee, please?
{15599}{15686}You mean....|I'm sure he'll turn up.
{15692}{15780}Wrapped around a pier.|You drove all the way here--
{15786}{15833}That's kind of you.
{15838}{15913}Who the hell am l, right?|I don't blame you.
{15919}{15991}Look, I know an officer in Hazelton.
{15998}{16123}-I could call him, he'll get details.|-I don't want to make it official.
{16128}{16180}Suppose it's just intentional.
{16186}{16253}-Here's your coffee.|-I know what you mean.
{16272}{16303}Men.
{16368}{16420}How do they sleep at night?
{16468}{16553}They have sex, that's how|they sleep at night.
{16579}{16631}He might be home already.
{16653}{16745}This place. Jesus.|It's no Sizzler, is it?
{16759}{16811}He'll be mad if I go to the police.
{16826}{16937}That's it. Keep it private.|Once they get your hooks in you....
{16946}{17021}I couldn't afford you.|We run a school.
{17027}{17105}A school? Then forget the police.
{17110}{17180}You can't afford the publicity.
{17191}{17267}Two, three days, I chase him down|to a girlfriend's...
{17272}{17331}...and scare him.
{17336}{17379}That wouldn't be easy.
{17408}{17433}Look...
{17439}{17486}...I don't want money.
{17500}{17593}Look at me. I'm chasing all|over for lunch dates...
{17599}{17677}...with guys I couldn't stand|10 years ago.
{17696}{17762}It'd give me something to do.
{17829}{17867}You ever smoke?
{17972}{18082}Look at this security system.|What's this? A piece of the Cross?
{18130}{18170}Aren't you hungry?
{18176}{18245}I thought I should eat, but....
{18277}{18325}You know what your problem is?
{18335}{18371}You're feeling guilty.
{18386}{18412}No...
{18425}{18456}...I'm not.
{18472}{18594}It's not your fault. It's men.|Testosterone.
{18605}{18657}They should put it in bombs.
{18695}{18725}Want that?
{19977}{20050}Mrs. Baran would like me to help|informally.
{20108}{20184}Well, Miss Vogel--or is it Detective?
{20189}{20226}Detective.
{20243}{20370}Detective, I don't think we need to|overreact. We've seen this before.
{20379}{20407}We have?
{20471}{20550}We, we, we. What is she,|the school nurse?
{20559}{20611}When did you last see your husband?
{20625}{20665}Last Saturday.
{20714}{20826}He was asleep when we left at 7.|Nicole and I drove out to her duplex.
{20832}{20858}Look!
{20864}{20978}This must be nice when it's full.|Isn't it dangerous, empty like this?
{20983}{21034}We lost some keys in there.
{21040}{21140}We should get back to our|students, they're on work crew.
{21146}{21236}I noticed. Must save money having|the kids work.
{21242}{21283}These older buildings.
{21289}{21348}His friends don't know where he is?
{21354}{21418}We haven't asked them.|It's kind of awkward.
{21424}{21493}"My husband's disappeared.|Have you seen him?"
{21510}{21584}Her husband.|It wouldn't be awkward for me.
{21590}{21681}If it's okay with you,|could I look at his address book?
{21686}{21778}We needn't make a|mountain out of a molehill.
{21784}{21857}Exactly. This place|crawling with police?
{21863}{21956}Wouldn't be something|to write home about. We'll tiptoe.
{21961}{22033}-Will you show me his things?|-Of course.
{22113}{22153}Nice meeting you.
{22417}{22500}This is lucky. The phone bill.
{22508}{22544}It came this morning.
{22593}{22630}May I?
{22766}{22809}This must be Miss Horner.
{22815}{22864}Pittsburgh. Earlier this month.
{22870}{22965}I call her there when she goes|there on weekends.
{22988}{23018}53 minutes.
{23024}{23079}72 minutes. Girl talk.
{23164}{23265}This is through Monday.|He didn't call you over the weekend?
{23317}{23431}-What kind of car does he drive?|-We have one car, the blue Cherokee.
{23437}{23528}-How'd you break the taillight?|-I don't know. It's old.
{23575}{23632}What was he wearing when he left?
{23649}{23707}His blue suit.
{23729}{23765}Can I see his closet?
{23784}{23817}Yes.
{23916}{23987}It's missing. His blue suit...
{23999}{24063}...and his belt with|the silver buckle.
{24069}{24145}You just have to look and you know.|Good for you.
{24162}{24242}A place for everything|and everything in its place.
{24261}{24358}I hope we're not too late.|There's video cameras out there.
{24368}{24461}-The news?|-No, it's some PR for the school.
{24467}{24546}-Is that all? I'm very tired.|-Of course.
{24574}{24603}The address book?
{24609}{24642}It's in his office.
{24649}{24674}I'll find it.
{24770}{24865}Just one more thing.|That isn't the suit there, is it?
{24948}{25036}You need to take Vawze's classes--|Oh, you're still here.
{25042}{25146}I was wondering if this is the suit|Dr. Baran was wearing on Sunday.
{25160}{25209}But close. He had two.
{25252}{25330}I'll go speak with|some other teachers now.
{25516}{25554}Why bring her here?
{25559}{25670}I'm supposed to act concerned.|Anyway, it keeps the police away.
{25675}{25706}Fine.
{25713}{25835}That woman should wear a prosthesis.|I hate all that survivor crap.
{25882}{25938}I'm really tired, Nicole.
{26066}{26152}It's okay. You did fine.|I heard you.
{26200}{26265}Just don't see her alone anymore.
{26359}{26388}Promise?
{26648}{26689}Can I get a printout of that?
{26695}{26742}You can get a dub too.
{26911}{26995}This is really cool stuff.|Inside Edition material.
{27000}{27077}The Magic Hour tape.|This guy gives "prick" a bad name.
{27083}{27108}What doesn't?
{27178}{27226}I want this one too.
{27441}{27533}Okay, if X equals four,|then X minus 2 is?
{27539}{27573}-Two.|-Great.
{27579}{27661}Ten plus X, when X equals 3 is?
{27693}{27719}I'm talking to you.
{27725}{27787}-Thirteen.|-Thank you.
{27832}{27880}Mrs. Baran needs you.
{27906}{27951}Review these equations.
{27957}{28065}Continue to work them until I return.|And stay in your seats.
{28326}{28367}This is Miss Horner.
{28380}{28446}Nicole, this is Lisa Campos.
{28514}{28585}Miss Campos is looking for Guy.
{28616}{28722}I'm sure Mrs. Baran told you that|Dr. Baran is away on business.
{28742}{28798}You said you didn't know where he was.
{28830}{28879}Well, someone has to pay.
{28885}{28917}He said he would.
{28923}{29021}I thought it over.|I don't want to wait until next month.
{29059}{29095}Excuse me?
{29102}{29154}Miss Campos is expecting.
{29172}{29234}Unto her, a child will be born.
{29300}{29374}-How is Dr. Baran involved?|-What do you think?
{29398}{29460}What makes you think it's Guy's?
{29465}{29544}That's what he said.|But, come on, I would know.
{29567}{29614}I don't sleep around.
{29624}{29661}He said he'd pay.
{29667}{29750}I'm not putting it on my card.|I'm maxed out.
{30076}{30156}So you're absolutely certain|this is Dr. Baran's?
{30162}{30245}-What does she have to say?|-Abortion is murder.
{30251}{30312}I'm gonna have an anesthetic.
{30324}{30365}How much will this cost?
{30371}{30444}They want 650, and that's a clinic.
{30449}{30567}I'm not holding anybody up here.|I want what he promised. Besides...
{30573}{30690}...it's your husband.|You don't want me to have his baby.
{30785}{30915}I wouldn't have come, only he said you|knew about his girlfriends.
{31052}{31087}Thank you.
{31154}{31237}And tell him not to call|when he does get back.
{31254}{31297}It's boundary time.
{31339}{31380}Incidentally...
{31430}{31510}...when did you last see Dr. Baran?
{31539}{31576}Sunday afternoon.
{31582}{31680}I dropped by. He was real wired up|about something.
{31694}{31732}Figured you two had a fight.
{31761}{31815}Make him pay you back.
{31876}{31906}Anyway...
{31917}{31947}...goodbye.
{32067}{32141}-You knew about her?|-Yeah.
{32167}{32225}Since last fall.
{32250}{32300}Right after you came.
{32337}{32386}You should've told me about her.
{32392}{32495}Why would I want you|to be hurt like I was?
{33064}{33106}Somebody knows.
{33505}{33615}They got a license plate.|They could've gotten a number wrong.
{33621}{33751}It looks like his car was there.|But we don't know if he was driving.
{33808}{33915}I told Mrs. Baran I ran Dr. Baran's|license plate through the DMV.
{33921}{34012}That pileup Monday on the l-80,|he was in it.
{34019}{34118}The report doesn't say much,|but his car's on the printout.
{34123}{34220}-You said that was an old dent?|-Did I?
{34238}{34315}Let's say he left Sunday,|wearing a blue suit.
{34321}{34364}Maybe to Pittsburgh?
{34370}{34445}He stopped for gas Sunday|in Williamsport.
{34462}{34558}Yes, Mrs. Baran gave me his credit|card numbers.
{34571}{34664}Anyway, it seems he was trying|to see you.
{34672}{34725}Pittsburgh is a big town.
{34762}{34845}You're sure you didn't hear from him|after Saturday?
{34869}{34925}That's not something we'd forget.
{34995}{35070}-Aren't you on room checks?|-Excuse me.
{35084}{35125}I'll be in touch.
{35147}{35187}I'm glad she didn't ask.
{35192}{35300}The cards weren't charged from|Sunday on. What are room checks?
{35306}{35366}Drug searches.|Kids here used to use.
{35372}{35428}My son had a habit years ago.
{35434}{35511}My husband and I looked for places.|He's dead.
{35517}{35563}-Your husband?|-Son.
{35569}{35657}IV drug users.|You know what happens.
{35663}{35704}But my ex is alive.
{35710}{35800}-Isn't God quirky? You got an ex?|-Nothing official.
{35806}{35884}Mine felt he was God's gift,|like that was on my list.
{35890}{36005}God, please send me someone who|wears black nylon socks to bed.
{36014}{36087}My heaven is where|they screw you barefoot.
{36093}{36180}-You make me want to pass the hat.|-Don't feel sorry for me.
{36186}{36314}He left. Every cloud has a silver|lining. He was too dull to kill.
{36334}{36422}-Did she want to kill her husband?|-Why would she?
{36428}{36486}Maybe she found out about you and him.
{36492}{36593}That's clever. Did you ask|the faculty or the students?
{36599}{36661}I know. You read it in the brochure.
{36667}{36750}-She knew?|-Of course she knew. Ask her.
{36756}{36839}Come on, she's not a murderer.|She's an ex-nun.
{36858}{36887}Remember them?
{36893}{36961}They disappeared overnight,|like dial phones.
{36971}{37031}And you?|What if he wouldn't leave her?
{37040}{37134}If I couldn't get a man to leave her,|I'd kill myself.
{37164}{37200}He has left her...
{37206}{37279}...apparently.|One way or another.
{37336}{37434}-Unless there's anything else....|-Just one more thing.
{37464}{37501}Guy did it barefoot.
{37569}{37596}"Did"?
{37614}{37658}Don't you mean, "does"?
{37889}{37925}Mrs. Baran?
{37953}{38004}It's dinnertime, Erik.
{38010}{38080}You should go inside with the others.
{38090}{38130}Are you okay?
{38151}{38204}You know the rules, Erik.
{38209}{38264}Your table can't eat without you.
{38284}{38347}It's so much nicer here since he left.
{38367}{38413}I hope he never comes back.
{38622}{38684}-Where'd you find those?|-I found them yesterday.
{38689}{38735}Give them to me.
{38773}{38871}-They're good, just a little rusty.|-Give them to me!
{39145}{39186}It means nothing.
{39192}{39290}The pool was empty and maybe he|saw them at the bottom.
{39307}{39365}I didn't. Did you?
{39384}{39470}If they were so plain to see....|See what it means?
{39475}{39522}It means we overlooked them.
{39527}{39629}It means Guy's watching us.|He's alive.
{39641}{39699}He's dead. And I'm not sorry.
{39718}{39806}And neither are you, if you're honest|with yourself.
{39812}{39907}Killing him is a good thing,|like planting a tree.
{39932}{40051}-Maybe there is a God.|-What're you talking about?
{40086}{40145}I haven't believed for so long.
{40169}{40227}When the pool was empty,|I thought...
{40238}{40284}...maybe there is a God.
{40303}{40401}And he knows what we did.|And he's coming for us.
{40432}{40555}It's not God, honey. That's a lady|detective with one breast.
{40577}{40630}You're always laughing at me.
{40658}{40699}So was Guy.
{40723}{40775}He must be laughing now.
{40795}{40845}I'm not laughing at you, Mia.
{40877}{40935}You are, a little...
{40958}{40991}...inside.
{41090}{41160}It's lonely without God, isn't it?
{41169}{41215}It's just lonely...
{41249}{41285}...period.
{42621}{42671}They're filling the pool!
{42761}{42878}-When will it be done?|-Soon! It's great!
{46779}{46836}We should have canceled this.
{46841}{46925}Everything's fine. Just calm down.
{46958}{46999}20 bucks they killed him.
{47015}{47110}-Dykes.|-That's why they're not all over you.
{47115}{47140}Thanks.
{47205}{47258}We could use Dr. Baran in this.
{47264}{47318}He's still away on business.
{47323}{47362}I don't want to be in it.
{47508}{47601}It's Parents' Day and these are|your parents.
{47612}{47720}Boys, you're happy,|but try not to look relieved, okay?
{47745}{47853}"I'm glad to see you, but boy,|is this school great!"
{47860}{47927}Moms, some of you can look|misty-eyed.
{47938}{47986}-Who wants to be misty?|-Here!
{47992}{48075}All right, you and you.|Don't overdo it.
{48084}{48162}Everyone have their numbers?|Number one.
{48197}{48242}Is that Dr. Baran?
{48258}{48301}What?
{48308}{48346}Up there, second floor.
{48468}{48525}Wait, I'll play it back.
{48858}{48912}It's someone, that's for sure.
{48939}{48977}It's Guy.
{49008}{49046}It's Guy.
{51089}{51130}What're you doing?
{51139}{51217}I'm fasting and praying for our sins.
{51253}{51347}I want you to stop that.|Come inside.
{51362}{51396}You're not well.
{51402}{51508}Each time I go to sleep,|I have to kill him over and over.
{51529}{51615}No, Mia, someone's playing|a game with us.
{51629}{51721}Come inside. You're ill.
{51800}{51832}It's holy water.
{51886}{51925}Come on.
{51988}{52048}What are you looking at? Go inside!
{52058}{52116}-Let's go.|-Go in!
{52154}{52179}Go!
{52358}{52449}-Where's your medicine?|-I'm sure it's there.
{52466}{52570}No, I think you're out.|I'll go get it refilled.
{52636}{52686}You should take these.
{52725}{52770}Here, go on.
{52810}{52905}-You'll be out before I return.|-I want you to go.
{52917}{52981}-Okay!|-No, I mean, away.
{52986}{53056}Leave the school, for good.
{53069}{53108}I'm sick of you.
{53171}{53285}-If they only knew.|-They will if you act like this.
{53299}{53410}The church can't save you,|no matter how much you pay them.
{53436}{53497}I know you gave|that priest my money.
{53505}{53574}Money shouldn't go to people|who love you.
{53579}{53629}It should go to people you love.
{53687}{53798}They don't love you, they used you.|You're scared so you're using them.
{53803}{53929}Like you used me? You were a good|teacher. We should've paid you more.
{53934}{53998}-You like playing the victim.|-Get out!
{54003}{54043}Leave me alone!
{54049}{54166}Fine, if that's what you want.|But from one saint to another:
{54171}{54290}Keep praying. Wear your knees out|that way for a change.
{58402}{58440}Hello?
{59459}{59495}Hello?!
{61884}{61918}Who's there?
{62027}{62069}Who's there?
{63632}{63670}Get the water bottle.
{64405}{64446}He's dead.
{64451}{64526}He's dead. He's dead.
{64532}{64625}God forgive you.|He's dead.
{65942}{66012}You're a lot tougher than I thought,|you little bitch.
{66160}{66206}Jesus, Guy.
{66213}{66289}Sucking on that douche bag hose|for 8 hours.
{66315}{66370}And that ride in the back...
{66377}{66416}...I've still got a cold.
{66421}{66530}I don't care what doctors say.|That fucking heart was made of iron.
{66565}{66629}I tried to reach you to call it off.
{66644}{66711}Call it off? What for?
{66729}{66786}I wish I could've seen her face.
{66791}{66835}The gags were great.
{66852}{66916}What will we do with|that detective?
{66922}{67002}Snooping around. She got hers.
{67007}{67060}You were supposed to call me.
{67089}{67135}You should find the body.
{67147}{67240}I'll show up tomorrow|and you break the news to me.
{67245}{67284}I'll be grief-stricken.
{67367}{67406}I think you should go.
{67425}{67450}Go?
{67558}{67612}Why? Haven't you missed me?
{67720}{67779}That's better. It's over.
{67788}{67832}So let's celebrate.
{68008}{68080}I don't want you to get caught.|You bet--
{68086}{68118}Is this natural?
{68152}{68204}I mean, the tub was full.
{68303}{68384}-Shouldn't she be undressed?|-Yeah, okay.
{68521}{68561}I thought she was dead!
{68567}{68647}I thought she was. I did.|It's over.
{68652}{68734}-She won't do anything.|-Lying bitch!
{68762}{68827}-Just let her go!|-You're with her!
{68832}{68890}-You are.|-No, I'm not! Mia, go!
{68930}{68958}Bitch!
{69032}{69070}Just you wait!
{69773}{69823}Don't you run away!
{69866}{69907}I said stop!
{70102}{70134}Come here!
{70224}{70270}Let me see your face!
{70290}{70366}Was it lonely, or did she|keep you company?
{70378}{70496}How's it feel, after years of|sainthood, to find us a perfect match?
{70502}{70564}You're just like me. Soul mates.
{70625}{70650}Bitch!
{70822}{70862}Want to confess before you die?
{70882}{70974}Say, "I'm sorry, Guy."|I'll forgive you, even if God won't.
{70979}{71014}Fuck you!
{71254}{71361}You son of a bitch.|This is a week late, asshole.
{71821}{71856}Oh, Jesus.
{71932}{71964}Mia, come on.
{74710}{74790}This way it'll be easier to claim|self-defense.
{74853}{74925}You know, paramedics|can work miracles.
{74945}{75005}One of us should go get one.
{75342}{75382}I'm sorry.
{75666}{75701}Goodbye.
Push!
Oh, God, it's coming!
Oh, God, it's coming!
No!
Please, give him to me.
Please.
No. Please, my baby.
Please, give him to me.
Damn you!
When Michael Myers was six years old, he stabbed his sister to death.
For years he was locked up, locked away in Smith's Grove Sanitarium.
But he escaped.
And suddenly...
Halloween was another word for mayhem.
He needed to wipe out his entire family.
He struck them down at night, and always on Halloween.
The police tried everything to stop him.
He overcame them all and disappeared.
The world thought him dead,
But I... I wasn't sure.
I wasn't sure that
Michael Myers had died.
Jamie, come to me.
Jamie, come to me.
Jamie...
Come with me if you want to save your baby.
- Oh, God... He's coming.
- We've got to move, now.
Come on.
No! Oh, God.
Come on.
It's okay!
You can do it.
You can do it.
There!
It's that way!
Go, now. Save your baby! Go now!
Jamie?
Jamie?
Hey!
What are you doing in my truck?
Run!
What the hell're you doing in my truck?
What?
Run!
What?
Danny. Danny.
- Kill for him.
- Mommy!
Danny?
Mommy's here.
What is it, baby?
The Voiceman. He's here.
- No one's there, sweetheart.
- But I've seen him.
You've been watching way too much TV, you know that?
He says things. Bad things.
Like what?
Okay.
Stay away monsters, stay away ghouls.
Stay away from Danny, you jerks know the rules.
Better? Here.
Good night, Danny.
Good night, mom.
It's "Back Talk" with Barry Simms.
Who is that guy?
We're in the second hour of a special Halloween
edition of "Back Talk". I'm Barry Simms.
As usual, we're coming
to you live from
high atop the Sears
Tower here in Chicago.
Tomorrow night, we will be
coming to you from Haddonfield,
the town that has banned
Halloween since 1989,
when infamous serial killer Michael Myers,
his niece, Jamie Lloyd, and about a
dozen cops were killed in an explosion.
We have a caller waiting.
Who's next to talk to me?
I... I know this may sound crazy, Barry, but...
I really think I'm in love with him.
He's so untamed, so uninhibited.
He's everything I've ever wanted in a man.
You know, this is good.
I can see the tabloids now.
"Psycho Lays Nympho:
The Best Sex He Ever Dismembers"
Is this the type that you always fall for, lady?
Any other serial studs on the list?
You know, Bundy, Manson?
What about that Dahmer guy? I bet...
- I bet you could really cook with him.
- No, I just want Michael.
I... I wanna know what's behind that mask.
Deep down, I think he's
just like you and me, Barry.
He just needs someone to understand him.
- Someone to love him.
- Yeah, deep down I'm sure that's true.
You're talking about one of this
nation's most notorious serial killers
like he belongs in some
kind of sex seminar.
You know, I hate to be the one
to break the news to you, lady,
but Michael Myers has
been dead for six years.
Now...
we've got someone who actually
claims to have seen that Michael Myers.
- Does this wacko caller have a name?
- My name's Tommy.
I was only eight years old, when I saw him.
But I was one of the lucky ones.
I survived.
There is help out there
for people like you.
It's called electro-shock therapy!
Come on. You don't really believe
that Michael Myers is actually alive.
Michael's work isn't done in Haddonfield.
And soon...
Very soon...
He'll come home...
To kill again.
But this time I'll be ready.
Actually, Tom, I hear Smith's Grove is
having a blue light on Vicodin; check that out.
The lines are open, so
give me your best shot
at 1-800-968-7825.
Now, Dwayne.
What's on your feeble excuse
for a mind tonight, Dwayne?
I'd just like to say that I listen
to your show every night, Barry.
I think you're the best.
I can't tell you how excited we are
that you'll be paying a little visit
to our little town tomorrow night.
So do you have a point
to make here, Dwayne,
or should I just keep
spanking the monkey?
Barry, you're too much.
I'd just like to say that I
understand how things
have changed in the 90's.
Gays in the military,
cut off your husband's dick
and become a national hero.
I just can't see any sense in
bringing Halloween back to Haddonfield.
Wink, wink. Thank you, Dwayne.
You may leave me now.
Next caller.
I say it's about time they had
a Halloween revival in this town.
Now my kids can
stop driving me crazy.
That maniac's either
long dead or long gone.
Either way, I say let's bury this
sucker and get the party started.
Party, woo-hoo!
Beer! Yeah!
Thank you, Ashley.
Barry, what happened to that psychiatrist of his, Loomis?
I heard the old quack was dead.
Not dead. Just very much retired.
- Good God. Terence. Come in.
- Christ, what a night.
Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!
That's the beauty of the countryside.
I thrive on it.
- God, you look good, Sam.
- I feel great.
I had surgery, plastic surgery.
Skin grafts. It cost a fortune, but at least I don't frighten people anymore.
Don't tell me the revered
Rasputin of Smith's Grove has grown complacent in his old age.
Well, I won't believe that for a second.
Well, I can't remember you making house calls, Dr. Wynn, especially at this hour.
And you're right.
I've come to celebrate?
Why are you listening to that jerk?
Oh, it's a program about Haddonfield.
I'm taping it.
So, who is responsible for getting
this Halloween rally thing together?
We are, the students of
Haddonfield junior college.
But why go to all the trouble
of throwing this soiree?
So what if Halloween has
been banned in Haddonfield?
Who gives a damn?
We do! We live here.
I mean, it's time we got on with our lives.
That's what tomorrow night is all about.
- This town is dying, Barry.
- Wow.
You know, I've heard Michael Myers blamed
for a lot of things tonight, but this is a first.
He's actually killed the economy!
Look, tomorrow night is
going to change all that,
especially after you do your
broadcast live from campus.
You have reached Haddonfield
Emergency Services.
Due to severe weather conditions,
all circuits are momentarily busy.
If this is not an emergency...
You gonna get up there on the stage with old Bar'?
- Uh, yeah, I will.
- Yeah?
Well, I'll see you tomorrow night.
This is "Back Talk" with Barry Simms.
Give me a call at 1-800-968-7825.
That's 1-800-YOU-SUCK.
So come on, all you
boogeyman believers out there.
Give me a call.
Call me tonight.
Well, after 32 years, guess who is finally relinquishing his duties as chief administrator of Smith's Grove?
- Good god, you don't mean to say you're—
- Retiring!
I came by to give you the news myself.
Well, I wish you well, Terence.
It's been in the planning stages for some time now.
To old friends...
To retirement...
To new beginnings.
Old friends.
Sam...
I want you to come back to Smith's Grove.
You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
It's no prank. You are the one I've chosen, Sam.
I want you to come back.
After my stroke six years ago they practically had to hold a pistol to my head to get me to retire, but...
Things are different now.
I'm different.
I've buried the ghosts.
I've buried them in this manuscript.
I don't want to practice medicine anymore.
- They're coming! They're coming!
- Yeah. So they're coming, they're coming.
Don't tell me, your name is Joan...
Joan of Arc, and you're also
hearing voices, right?
Now, who's coming?
It's Michael.
Michael Myers.
Look, someone, anyone...
Help me. Dr. Loomis, are you out there?
- Can you hear me? Dr. Loomis, I need your help.
- Please, please. No, no, stop. Stop that.
What the hell is going on tonight?
Every looney in the state is calling.
What is this? A full moon?
Oh, man. I guess Halloween
brings out all the wackos.
I can't wait until we get
to Haddonfield tomorrow.
Shhh. Shhhh.
It's okay.
Yes. It's alright.
Shhh. Yes.
It's okay.
No!
Leave us alone!
You can't have the baby, Michael.
You can't have the baby.
Enough... of this Michael Myers... bullshit!
Now, you stinking kids got about three seconds to get the hell off my property!
One!
Two!
It was Jamie Lloyd.
That was six years ago, Sam.
You know she died with him in that explosion.
- You know it!
- That's what someone would like us to believe.
But I tell you Michael is alive.
I can feel his evil heart beating,
I can see him just as I did all those years ago behind these very same walls.
Staring, staring.
Always growing stronger.
Please. As my colleague, as my friend, I can't go through this again.
Not alone.
I need your help to stop him.
Dr. Wynn, I didn't expect you in this morning.
Donna, this is Dr. Loomis, the man I was telling you about.
Oh, yes. It's a pleasure to meet you, doctor.
It will be wonderful to have you back at the hospital.
Dr. Wynn, there's something you should know.
Donna, I'd like you to get
Dr. Loomis anything he needs.
Files, tests, records of every treatment we've ever administered to a former patient of ours, Michael Myers.
- Michael Myers?
- Is something wrong?
I just received a phone call.
That girl Jamie Lloyd...
Her body was found this morning near Haddonfield.
Notify the Haddonfield sheriff; tell him we're on the way.
I want the entire staff on alert.
We go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours.
If that maniac is really out there...
I plan to bring him back.
Alive.
Yo, G, wassup?!
Barry's my homeboy from Chicago.
Yes, that Barry Simms.
Beth and I are down on this gig.
Danny.
Look, you just bring the posse tonight, and we'll hook you up.
Ace.
Doesn't Danny look cute dressed up as his Uncle Tim?
Great. Now I've got a six-year-old gang member for a son.
Perfect.
This is the famous Tim
Strode stomach pounder.
- You down for the challenge?
- Hit me, G.
Good try, Dan man.
You better stick to orange juice.
Shitheads.
Defacing my property.
- I showed them.
- John, they were just kids.
Kids, my dear Deborah, are what's ruining this country.
Everywhere you go it's the same damn thing.
There's no goddamn respect.
I rest my case.
Kara, you'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach.
"Cognitive therapy and emotional disorders".
What are they teaching you in college these days?
The art of going crazy?
It's called psychology, mom.
Living in this house is enough to drive anyone crazy.
Oh, yeah?
Well, who the hell asked you to come back here in the first place?
I better get Danny to school.
Doesn't show her face around her own family for five years... then comes back and expects us to roll out the red carpet.
You think going to college is gonna make up for your mistakes, girl?
- John, please.
- Lay off her, dad.
Let's go, Danny.
Kara, wait, please. John, can't we just sit down for once and try to be a family?
Sorry, Mom.
Oh, yeah, that's it, Deborah.
Just keep slipping her the cash.
You know, while you're at it,
I got a great idea. Here.
Why don't you give her all of our goddamn money?
Why don't you leave her alone?
Nothing ever changes, does it?
You've gotta wake up.
I got news for you, girl.
Before you came around, everything was going fine.
Until you landed on our doorstep.
You and that little... bastard of yours.
I see only one bastard in this house.
Danny...
Get away from her!
- You shut up and stay outta this!
- John, please, don't!
- Kill for him.
You ever talk to me like that again and so help me God...
You understand?
Give me the knife, Danny.
Hey...
Hey. Make way for the Hardin County Express.
Where's Tim?
We're supposed to go over the list of events for tonight.
Oh, God.
Did he do that to you?
Another episode of "Father
Knows Best" at the Strode house.
What the hell happened this time?
- What's gotten into you?
- Just glad to see you, that's all.
You guys okay?
Tonight's the night we bring some life back into this town.
Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to organize this friggin' fair?
I mean, it's only Halloween.
How many times do I have to tell you.
It's not about Halloween.
Now, Danny, you know Grandpa didn't really hurt me, right?
Right, Mom.
Well, you'd better go catch your bus.
But tonight when you come home we'll go trick-or-treating, okay?
Okay.
- I love you, Danny.
- I love you, Mommy.
Give me a squeeze.
Yeah. Okay.
I just can't live with her anymore, Deborah.
You don't understand, do you?
It's not about Kara, it's about you.
I don't care what she's done; she's your daughter.
She's not my daughter anymore.
Beth, who's that guy who lives across the hall from you?
Why, you interested?
Yeah, right.
He's always staring out his window.
Last night, I caught him watching me.
That must be Tommy.
On a weirdness scale of one to ten, he rates about a 13.
Supposedly some scary shit happened to him, when he was a kid.
Messed up his head pretty bad.
He's harmless, though.
- He's probably just lonely.
- Or horny.
Something you probably haven't felt in a while.
Tim...
Happy Halloween, Mrs. Blankenship!
Best part about living in that boarding house is that crazy old lady wouldn't hear a truck drive through her living room.
Please. Look, you've gotta listen to me!
They're coming! They're coming!
Yeah, so they're coming, they're coming.
Don't tell me. Your name is Joan...
Joan of Arc and you're also hearing voices, right?
Come on. Now, who's coming?
It's Michael.
Michael Myers.
Look, someone, anyone, help me.
Dr. Loomis, are you out there?
Can you hear me, Dr. L...
It's Michael.
Michael Myers.
...your attention, please.
Bus 611 from Pontiac...
Look, someone, anyone, help me.
Dr. Loomis, are you out there?
Can you hear me, Dr. Loomis? I need your help.
- God, please, help.
- May I have your attention, please?
Bus 34 from Peoria, Russelville and Gardner... with through service to Chicago, Illinois... will be arriving in five minutes.
Ticketed passengers, please wait inside the door until arrival of bus number 34.
Can I help you, sir?
Can you tell me if a bus arrived from Pontiac last night?
Sure did.
- Are you looking for someone?
- Thank you.
May I have your attention, please?
Bus number 34, service to Chicago, has arrived and is now ready for boarding through the side doors.
Jesus.
Shhh. Shhh.
No. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, man.
It's okay.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
Good God, what's that?
It's... his mark.
He's come home.
Dear God.
Jamie.
Only God can help her now, sir.
Sam, don't.
Let them take care of her.
- Doctor Loomis.
- Yeah.
They told me you'd be coming.
Now I suggest you go right on back to your crackpot asylum.
You people got no business in my town.
Michael Myers is my business.
It's been quiet here for six years and that's the way it's gonna stay, and the last thing I need now is you going around spouting off ghost stories.
I suppose it was a ghost that did all this, then.
It was a ghost talking on the radio last night.
That's a ghost being carried out of here right now?!
Yo, check it out!
Tonight's gonna be killer.
Kara, I swear. One of these days, you're gonna get lost in that thing.
- I can't find my term paper.
- So copy someone else's. I do it all the time.
Works primo.
Oh, shit!
Looks like your little boy has got himself quite an imagination.
He's been having nightmares.
I think it's cool.
- Must be some nightmares.
- Beth, we got work to do.
Hey...
Are you gonna be okay?
"Thorn"?
I need to see a doctor.
- What seems to be the problem?
- Uh, it's my baby.
There's been an accident.
- What kind of accident?
- Get me a doctor! Now!
Security?
Sam, there's nothing you can do for her now.
Dr. Loomis?
Yeah.
Dr. Loomis...
Thank God you're here.
You heard her last night, didn't you?
It was Jamie.
I'm sorry.
- I don't know you, do I?
- I'm Tommy.
Tommy Doyle.
Laurie Strode, Jamie's mother, was baby-sitting me the night when...
Tommy Doyle.
What're you doing here?
Please...
I need to know the truth.
Michael Myers has come home, hasn't he?
What do you know about Michael?
I know he's still out there.
People in this town, they want us to believe he's dead, but I know.
I've always known.
She's out there fighting for her life.
If she should die...
- She is the last of his bloodline.
- No, Dr. Loomis.
She's not the last.
Oh, God.
There's a family. Relatives of the people who adopted Laurie: the Strodes.
They're living in the Myers house.
Dr. Loomis, about Michael...
- It's just a theory of mine of...
- That's him.
Meet me tonight.
9:00 at the campus rally.
Tommy, wait!
Wait!
Tommy, wait!
Oh, there you are.
Who is that boy?
An old friend.
Great.
I'm very sorry, Mrs. Strode.
Is everything all right?
Who are you?
I came to help your family.
Shh. Shh.
It's okay.
Okay.
Steven.
You like that name?
Yeah, I think it suits you.
It's okay. It's alright.
I won't let anything happen to you.
For 15 years I've been obsessed to find out what was going on inside of him.
It's been my life's work, and my ultimate failure.
This force, this thing that lived inside of him came from a source too violent, too deadly for you to imagine. It...
It grew inside him.
Contaminating his soul.
It was... pure evil.
- What makes you think he'll come back here?
- This house... is sacred to him.
He has all his memories here.
His rage!
Mrs. Strode...
I beg of you.
Don't let your family suffer the same fate that Laurie and her daughter suffered.
- Jamie? I... I thought that she—
- She's been found.
Outside Haddonfield, stabbed.
What should I do?
I really am sorry, but you haven't a moment to lose, Mrs. Strode.
Michael Myers has come back to Haddonfield to kill.
Strode Real Estate.
John, something terrible's happened.
What do you want now, Deborah?
A man came by the house, a psychiatrist by the name of Loomis.
And he told me about the terrible things that happened here in our house.
Deborah, what the hell are you doing?
Talking to strangers, letting 'em in our house?
John, they found Jamie Lloyd this morning.
Someone tried to kill her.
Deborah, I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
You ought to stop watching those damn TV talkshows.
I'm getting the children out of here.
At least until I know what's going on.
John, I want you to come with us.
You know. You know, Deborah.
You've lost it. You know that, Deborah?
You've just lost it.
The reason you moved us into this house...
Your brother could never sell it because of what happened here, could he?
And you knew.
And you didn't tell us, John.
You knew.
Goddamnit!
Happy Halloween, little girl.
Hello?
We want the child.
Who is this?
Oh, Michael.
I'm coming.
Yeah, I'm...
Get ready, oh, yes! Yeah. Yes.
I'm coming, all right, and you'd better
be there at the Halloween Harvest fair.
Let's do it, together.
Sorry.
Mom? I'm home!
Hello?
Mom!
Mom?
Mom?
Danny?
Mom?
Are you there?
What are you doing here?
I'm your neighbor from across the street.
- Tommy Doyle.
- What are you doing with my son?
And... and where's my mother?
She wasn't here... when Danny came home.
Danny, go downstairs.
But Tommy's my new friend.
He knows all about dinosaurs.
You're in danger. Come with me.
Hi, Mrs. B!
You don't really expect us to stay here, do you?
I want you to watch your house.
You can see everything from that window.
Do you know how insane this is?
Who am I supposed to be looking for?
Him.
Yeah. It's okay.
It's okay, Steven.
Mommy!
Mom!
Not now, Danny.
Here you go.
Come on.
What?
Here. Let me try.
There.
There.
See?
All it takes is a mother's touch.
Uncle Michael, please don't hurt me.
Oh, God, please forget me.
Your work is done now, Jamie.
I let you down again, Jamie.
I never should have left you.
Runes were a kind of... early alphabet... that originated in Northern Europe about 500 B.C.
They were symbols carved out of stone or pieces of wood, used in pagan rituals to portend future events and invoke magic.
Of all the runes, Thorn had the most negative influence.
Among the ancient druids, Thorn represented a demon that spread sickness, destroyed crops, and brought death to hundreds of thousands of people.
According to a Celtic legend, one child from each tribe was chosen to be inflicted with a curse of Thorn.
To offer the blood sacrifices of its next of kin on the night of Samhain.
Halloween.
The sacrifice of one family meant sparing the lives of an entire tribe.
So why are you so concerned about us if Michael's only out to kill his family?
In his mind, anyone living in his house is his family.
For years I've been convinced there must be some reason.
Some method behind Michael's madness.
And the common link I found is Thorn.
The druids were also great mathematicians and astronomers.
The Thorn symbol is actually constellation of stars that appears from time to time on Halloween night.
Whenever it appears, he appears.
I've traced it back to 1963, when Michael murdered his sister, Judith.
The next time was in 1978; Michael escapes from Smith's Grove.
It happened a decade later, and the year after that. He kills again.
Now Jamie says Michael is back, and for the first time in 6 years,
Thorn reappears.
Coincidence?
What would happen if he succeeded, if he killed the last member of his family?
Well, Michael's power would end, and the curse would be passed on to another child.
I think that's why these people, whoever they are, are after Jamie's baby.
To make it Michael's final sacrifice.
Where are you going?
To find the only man who can stop him before it's too late.
Oh, no. Where's Danny?
Danny?
Danny!
Mrs. Blankenship!
Have you seen...
Danny, don't ever walk off without telling me where you're going!
Take him upstairs.
Lock the door and wait till I get back.
Kara...
Whatever you do...
Don't go back to your house.
You let him get to her!
How could you?
Dr. Loomis, during surgery we discovered that Jamie's uterus was hemorrhaging, and we found this.
It's placental fluid.
Good God in heaven, do you mean to say—
I estimate she gave birth no more than 24 hours ago.
Then the question is:
Where is the baby?
I think I...
I may already know.
Do you know why we celebrate Halloween?
Because that's when we go trick-or-treating and get candy.
Oh, well...
Yes, but...
A long, long time ago, it was a night of great power, when the days grew short and the spirits of the dead returned to their homes to warm themselves by the fireside.
All across the land huge bonfires were lit.
Oh, there was a marvelous celebration.
People danced and they played games.
And they dressed up in costumes.
Hoping to ward off the evil spirits.
Especially the boogeyman.
What's the boogeyman?
Come on, Danny.
Say good night to Mrs. Blankenship.
- Good night, Mrs. Blankenship.
- He hears the voice, you know.
Just like the other boy that lived in that house.
What are you talking about?
I was baby-sitting with him that night.
Little Mikey Myers that lived across the street.
And that's when the voice came, the night he murdered his sister.
Michael heard a voice?
It told him to kill his family.
- Where the hell's Barry? Let's go!
- Don't get star-struck on me now.
We got a real agenda here, and Barry is gonna help us get the message out.
Hey, look...
Helloooo, Haddonfield!
- Barry!
- WKNB presents "Back Talk" with Barry Simms.
- live from Haddonfield, Illinois,
- Barry! the home of Michael Myers!
Deborah!
I'm home!
Thanks for the dinner.
Come out, come out...
Wherever you are.
Goddamnit.
She actually left.
I know what's going on.
It must be the boogeyman.
Here I come, boogeyman.
'Cause, you know, I am really scared.
What the hell?
The power's off.
Tell me, kids, how's it feel to... finally pull Halloween out of the proverbial Haddonfield closet?
What we're saying here is... we will no longer let the powers that be control our minds.
For years...
Halloween has represented everything that's wrong with Haddonfield.
But Michael Myers is long gone.
There is NO boogeyman!
Whoa!
Does she get this riled up in the sack, Tim?
I bet she wears crotchless panties and barks like a dog.
Beth...
What do you say, honey?
You and me, uh...
As I was saying...
We have to stop acting out of fear.
Just look at Tim's family.
They live in the Myers house.
You do?
We do?
Uh... yeah, we do.
Great house.
- Strong wood.
- I see. You mean to tell me you actually live... in the house... of the most brutal mass murderer in history?
This is the Barry Simms show.
And when we return... we'll be coming at you live... from the one... the only...
Myers house.
How's that for a Halloween shock-fest?
How far to your house, kid?
About half a mile, but I don't know if my folks...
Good, I'll meet you there in five.
What about the kids?
We're supposed to throw all the candy.
Phone!
Relax your crack, sweetheart.
Quick tootle around the old household and we'll be right on back.
Pull the van out back, so that I can sneak out of here nice and quietly.
Oh, no. No, no, really, really.
You're too good to me. Really.
No. Thanks for putting me in the middle of this cheap-shit country bumpkin outfit, Paul.
I really appreciate it!
My fans expect better than this.
No, no. Look, you tell that penny-pinching whiner
Mike Sarducci that when I get back,
I am personally gonna cut off his balls and wear 'em as earrings.
Where's the goddamn van?
God!
Oh, no, I'm trotting out for a cheeseburger.
I'm taking the show to the real Myers house, where we should have done it in the first place.
Ten minutes in that house and I'll have every fruitcake medium in the country calling in trying to channel the spirit of that pussy Michael Myers.
Sure, we can do another show about him.
Kick the audience in the face enough and they'll lick you all over.
I'll call you when I get back, Paul. Bye-bye.
Where the f...
What happened to the lights?
Do you really think Barry's gonna show up?
Let's hope not.
I'm sorry he turned out to be such an asshole.
It's okay.
Where is everyone?
Mom?
Kara?
They're probably at the fair, which is where we should be.
Beth...
What you said before about
Michael Myers living in our house.
Is that really true?
It was a cold Halloween night.
He stood in the shadows, watching through the windows... as his sister and her boyfriend made love.
Then he crept inside... picked up a huge butcher knife... and made his way up these stairs.
He raised the knife up behind her...
She turned around... and he stabbed her!
Cut it out, Beth!
I really didn't know that Michael
Myers lived in my house, okay?
It freaks me out.
I'm sorry.
I was just fooling around.
It's okay.
Let's get the candles.
Just a minute.
Mommy, it's raining.
It's raining red.
Mommy, it's raining.
It's raining red.
Mommy, it's raining.
It's raining red.
Mommy, it's raining red.
Mommy, it's raining.
It's raining red.
Mommy, it's raining.
It's raining red.
Mommy, it's raining.
It's raining red.
Mommy, it's raining red.
It's warm.
Why is it warm?
Dr. Loomis.
It's happening.
Your sister would kill us if she knew we did it in her bed.
Hey, that was your idea.
I am bad, aren't I?
Only when you wear crotchless panties and bark like a dog.
Where are you going?
I gotta take a shower.
You know, to stay fresh.
Watch out for the boogeyman.
Hey, Beth, can you bring a towel in here? I'm freezing.
Where are you when I need you, honey?
Thanks.
I'll be in in a minute.
Mommy?
Hold on a second, Danny.
Danny... Come to me...
- Hello?
- Mom? Wait, who is this?
No, this is Beth.
What are you doing there?
- Do you know where my mother is?
- She's not home. No one is.
What's wrong?
Is Tim with you?
He's in the shower.
I'm across the street.
I can see you.
Beth, I want you to listen to me.
Get Tim and get out of that house.
Right now.
Carol, what the hell is going on?
Beth, look out! There's someone in the room.
He's right behind you!
No!
No!
Danny, no!
Danny!
Danny.
Danny?
Danny?
Danny.
Mommy?
It's okay.
Danny, run!
Danny.
Come to mommy.
Danny, please.
The baby.
Where's the baby?
Please!
Open the door!
Please!
Open the door!
Someone help us!
Please, somebody help us!
Help us, please!
Help us, please!
Get 'em upstairs!
Now!
Where's the baby?
He's gone.
Who else knew I had the baby?
- No one.
- No!
There had to be someone else...
- Who knew?
- Nobody knew except me and...
Danny. Come to me.
Danny. Come to me.
Come Danny, come to me.
Danny, no.
No.
Please.
Careful with the girl.
Kara!
Wynn.
Mrs. Blankenship!
Oh, God, hurry! We have to...
Hello, dear.
Where is she?
Where's Kara?
I feel like I've been drugged.
We have been drugged.
Why are they doing this?
Why didn't they just kill us?
It's his game.
And I know where he wants to play it.
- Dr. Loomis, you know that can't stop Michael.
- Nothing will stop Michael.
But...
Wynn.
I tried to tell you in the hospital.
I think Michael is under the influence of an evil rune.
Thorn.
I saw the symbol marked up where we found Jamie stabbed.
Well, there are runes of light... Protection.
If Thorn could somehow be trapped by these runes the energies could cancel themselves out.
The evil could be destroyed.
You wait here.
Don't go anywhere until I come back.
Wynn.
About time, Dr. Loomis.
Welcome to your fate.
The time has come for you to know the truth.
The time has come for you to join us.
Why now?
After Jamie escaped last night,
I knew that she would come to you, and I knew that you would lead us to her baby.
Her very special baby.
I needed her, just as I need you now.
It's your destiny, Sam.
It lives inside you.
It always has.
You know that, don't you?
You... are... a madman.
Look around you, Sam.
Madness everywhere.
Famine, war, a great plague.
These are signs that we must restore balance to the natural order of things.
- We merely provide the means.
- Michael?
We've given him the power.
The gift of Thorn.
I am its deliverer. I follow it, act as its guardian.
I protect Michael, watch over him.
And now it's time for another.
Now it's time for you....
Dr. Loomis.
I thought Michael was a monster.
But you...
Leave him there.
It's his office now.
Spirits and powers of the flame.
Attend and witness this ritual.
Bear our gifts to Thorn.
Open us to the path of darkness.
By these runes transform us.
Let the hammer descend on the chosen one to whom we offer this sacrifice of innocent blood.
And then, Danny, your journey begins.
Kill for him.
No.
Michael, your final sacrifice.
Michael, you can make him stop it.
Don't kill the baby.
You can stop it.
You know whose baby it is, don't you?
- Michael!
- The baby is yours, isn't it?
Isn't it, Michael?
Back off!
- Untie her.
- Do as he says. Do it!
You should join us, you have talent.
Shut up.
Danny, come on.
Go! Okay? Let's go.
Run!
Go!
Go, go!
Move it! Go, go!
Shit!
- Come on!
- It's not working.
Come on. It's not working!
It's not...
Back up from the gates!
Get 'em out of here!
Get in there!
Go on, get in!
Mommy!
Samhain.
Tommy! Where is he?
It worked.
The power of the runes stopped him.
Michael.
What have they done to you?
- Where do we go now?
- As far away from Haddonfield as possible.
- Come with us.
- No, I have a little business to attend to here.
Michael.
Michael.
It's all over.
It's all over!
It's all over now.
Michael.
Michael's gone.
It's your game now, Dr. Loomis.
SUBTITLES BY LUIS-SUBS
Swann.
And the fire said to me... said to me...
"Nix, Nix, you are my instrument.
From now on you shall be known... as... the Puritan.
You will find a few good men... and women... and together... together... you will cleanse the world."
Master.
Swann's here.
Are we ready?
- Ready.
- Maybe we should think about this.
He's gone too far.
So he took a kid.
He's gonna kill her.
He could drive us crazy.
So stay out here!
Please get away from me.
Hush!
Please don't hurt me!
I said, hush.
What is it?
What's the matter, huh?
Please! Please!
What are you gonna do to me?
Leave me alone!
Want me to shoot, Swann?
Leave me alone!
You don't like him, do you?
- He wants her magic.
- Maybe.
Go! Fetch him.
I think he's in love.
If you see the kid, yell.
- Quaid.
- Hey, man.
It's Quaid.
I thought you weren't coming back.
I changed my mind.
You can't leave, man.
He won't let you.
You're gonna be okay.
Okay?
I knew you'd come.
I've got so much power to give you, Swann.
All you have to do... is beg.
Fuck you.
You don't think that
I've got it to give?
You're wrong!
I could eat your fucking soul!
Now be a good girl.
Fuck!
Stay here.
- Jennifer, are you okay?
- Jesus!
Stay away.
Stay the fuck away.
Are you okay?
How would you like... to see the world... the way it really is?
You wanna see flesh... with a god's eyes?
Swann?
Here he is.
Take a look, Swann.
These are your friends.
What have you done to him?
- Swann...
- Don't touch me!
He got into my head!
You wanna be like that, Swann?
Mud? Shit?
Come here.
Share the power.
Swann.
Help me.
Bag.
Help me.
- What are you doing?
- Binding you.
You piece of shit!
This isn't over, Swann.
This isn't finished.
Dead?
Dead.
What now?
We bury him so deep... no one will ever find him.
I been calling you for three days, Harry.
I missed you too, Loomis.
You got a beer?
I got a job for you... if you can tear yourself away from all this weird shit.
You need a woman's touch in here.
Why don't you get yourself a secretary?
On what you pay me?
So get married.
Tried that.
Oh, yeah.
"Harry D'Amour, who describes himself as a private detective... has been linked with occult activities on several occasions.
'We regard D'Amour as a highly dubious character...' quoted one source."
That's nice, Harry.
It's all bullshit.
It was on TV last night.
You looked like shit, by the way.
- Thanks.
- What's the story?
Was the kid really possessed?
Probably.
By what?
You know.
The usual.
You need a vacation.
Somewhere sunny, like...
L.A.
That's where the job is?
Guy's name's Tapert.
Big insurance fraud.
He's gone west to spend his ill-gotten gains.
It's worth ten grand... if you catch him doing it.
If I don't?
Catch a tan.
I need someone of your caliber on this, Harry.
Taste the darkness, D'Amour.
It's been waiting for you.
Yeah, well, maybe I do need a vacation.
You'll like L.A.
There's great weather, great women.
- Here you go.
- Thanks. Have a nice evening.
You bet.
Hello, L.A.
9:18 p.m.
Tapert's paying by the hour.
He's getting his money's worth.
Come here, you fuckers! Come on in!
Wait a minute.
He's late for something.
What the hell?
Ever watched a man die?
If you watch very closely... you can sometimes see the soul escaping.
And if you're very quick... you can catch it.
I wasn't there.
Ask Pimm.
Pimm's dead.
Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared.
They knew the Puritan was coming home.
So did you.
Wait.
Don't leave me.
Did you come for a reading?
My God.
What?
You are drawn to the dark side... over and over.
You don't like that.
Not much.
You can't change it.
You must walk the line... between heaven and hell.
It is your destiny.
Accept it.
Hang on.
I'm not afraid to die.
There's something terrible... coming home soon.
The Puritan?
Who is he?
Shit.
What were you doing up here?
I'm a private detective.
I was hired to follow a guy named
Tapert for a couple of days.
- Insurance fraud.
- Tapert.
So now I've got Tapert,
Butterfield...
Tapert's got nothin' to do with this.
He just came to get his palm read.
This is something else.
You ever heard of somebody called the Puritan?
New one on me. Let's see him.
Where the fuck is he?
He got up and walked.
After that fall, he would've broken half his bones.
I don't think he'd have given a shit.
D'Amour.
Why do I know that name?
I know him.
I saw him on TV.
Some kid got possessed, and he saved the little bastard's life.
A priest?
He's just some guy... who's got a nose for this shit.
Like you.
I don't want him getting in the way.
He won't.
We've, all of us, waited too long... to have the homecoming spoiled.
What do you mean, "all of us"?
A lot of people believed in Nix.
They haven't forgotten his promise.
About?
Death.
What about death?
It's an illusion.
Coffee, Mrs. Swann?
Yes, thank you.
Where's Mr. Swann?
In his study.
He got something on his mind?
Hey. Mr. Sunshine.
That's what I'm gonna call you.
Bad show?
The usual.
Full house.
Standing ovation.
I tell them it's magic.
They believe you.
Yeah.
Remember Quaid?
Sure.
I think they killed him.
Oh, God.
I just saw him too.
I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.
Something special.
I want you to be there.
Of course.
You want me to find out about Quaid?
- I mean, the funeral?
- No.
I'm not going anywhere near him.
Higher.
Another inch.
The left hand side is too low.
Valentin?
Good. There.
Yes?
I want you to find this man D'Amour for me.
Think any movie stars buried around here?
Probably.
It's not a bad place.
It's warm, lots of palm trees.
I don't think the dead much care.
You sure?
- Are you a believer, then?
- Oh, yeah.
I signed on for all of them in my time.
Catholic, Hindu, Moonies.
You can't have too many saviors.
Who's that?
Swann's wife.
I want you to help me help my husband.
He's in some kind of trouble... something to do with the man you saw murdered.
I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
And you don't?
I think we make our own futures.
So, what's the connection?
I don't exactly know.
Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
Why not?
He's a secretive man.
And you don't ask questions?
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
But obviously you still care about him.
We wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't.
Swann is one of the most remarkable men alive.
You don't believe me?
He's an illusionist.
That's not exactly brain surgery.
I'm sorry. You asked.
No, you're right.
He could've been something more.
Maybe a lot more.
But sometimes people get lost.
Even good people.
- Too much money, too much fame.
- Where do I sign up?
Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?
- Harry.
- Harry.
When do you want me to start?
Come to the show with me.
It's his last performance in L.A. tonight.
I want you to see him with an audience. They love him.
Do you?
I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.
- Tonight?
- Sure.
Okay.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
- I'm glad you could make it.
- Are you kidding?
This is a big deal for me.
I gotta have the tux back by midnight.
Valentin!
I'm here.
The guy with Dorothea... is that him?
- Check if he's ready.
- Ready?
Ready.
How the fuck does he do that?
It's wires.
- I don't see no wires.
- So, what is it? Magic?
Ladies and gentlemen... you are standing on the threshold of a miracle.
Come with me into the great beyond.
He's good.
You haven't seen anything yet.
This is the new illusion.
Have you seen this before?
There's something wrong here.
For God's sake!
Wait! Who are you?
Oh, God.
Please.
Please, Dorothea.
Come away.
It's no use.
I got you, you fucker!
Who did this, D'Amour?
Who killed Swann?
You did.
Didn't you?
Why would I?
Beats me.
You don't have a clue what you're into, do you?
I feel it!
Deep shit?
Who did this?
It was...
It was...
And this Butterfield guy?
Vanished.
Another fucking magician. Jesus.
You through with me?
For now.
You planning on moving back to New York?
No, not yet.
- They treating you all right?
- Yeah.
I heard what happened.
I think I'm gonna stick around for a while.
Maybe dig in places that cops wouldn't look.
I wouldn't know where you'd start.
Maybe with the other illusionists?
They won't tell you anything.
I can be very persuasive.
Yeah.
I think you probably can.
Now, down here is what they call the repository.
Behind those locked doors... lies every secret of magic known to mankind.
- Ever been in there?
- Me? No.
No, there are only three keys.
Vinovich has got one, of course.
It is more than entertainment.
We are opening up people's heads.
We are bringing miracles back into their miserable little lives.
But they're fake miracles.
Houdini believed he had spirit guides.
Do you believe that?
I believe... that we walk a narrow path... between...
Heaven and hell?
Divinity and trickery.
So then, sometimes... the miracles are real.
No. They are always fake.
The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
You could walk on water?
I can reproduce any miracle that has ever been performed... with a little preparation.
Even one of Swann's?
- They were no damn good.
- Really?
That's funny.
I heard he was one of the best.
If he was so good, why is he so dead?
You tell me.
I figured you'd have some theory.
I have many theories.
I'd like to hear one of them.
I'm not saying another word.
You damn fool, Wilder.
This man is a journalist.
No, I'm not a journalist.
I just wanted to know about Swann.
He was a freak.
Everything he did was tainted.
- With what?
- Evil!
He was evil.
Are you coming?
Do not speak to this man if you wish to keep my company.
That's a great accent.
What is it, Brooklyn?
Fuck you, all right?
Harry.
I've got to be careful.
- If Vinovich sees me talking to you...
- What do you want, Billy?
I heard a name.
Someone they talk about in whispers.
Who?
Nix.
He's dead now, but I think maybe he taught Swann.
Who's doing the talking?
Vinovich.
But you burned your bridges there.
This is me.
Good luck.
I loved what you did in there.
What are you looking at?
I just want to know what Philip saw in those cards and stop it from happening.
Divinity and trickery.
Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared.
- D'Amour.
- Harry, I know it's late.
That's okay.
How'd it go today?
Went up to the Magic Castle.
You were right. He didn't have a lot of friends up there.
They were jealous of him.
Why? Because he had you?
He didn't have me. I told you.
Yeah, you didn't marry him for love.
So, why did you marry him?
That's none of your business, Harry.
You ever hear of somebody called Nix?
Dorothea?
Yeah, I'm here.
I don't know the name.
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
It doesn't ring a bell.
I have to go.
That's it?
All right. Look, I'll keep digging.
Yeah. You do that.
"Keep Out Police Department"
Ever watched a man die?
Yes.
"Desiderio."
What are you doing here?
Looking for you.
- I tried the hotel.
- So why you'd come here?
You're a detective with no clues.
Where else would you look?
Do you mind?
I'll keep this brief.
Here's $30,000.
What for?
A ticket home.
You didn't hire me. She did. She wants me to stop, I wanna hear it from her.
- She doesn't want to see you.
- No?
- People are dying here.
- Yes.
It's a terrible tragedy.
Is that all you have to say?
It's a fucking terrible tragedy?
- I want to know why.
- Why people die?
Give it up, D'Amour. Go home.
Don't try to see her, D'Amour.
Just leave her alone.
Lock up, will you?
Jennifer has only ever had one visitor.
- Mr. Quaid?
- Right.
- He's dead, isn't he?
- Yeah.
Heard it on the news.
Jennifer doesn't know... and frankly, this isn't the best time for her to be told.
I won't say anything.
She's been with us for four years and she was coming along nicely.
Past month she's been worst than ever.
- What's her problem?
- She has no real grip on reality.
- Does anybody?
- Oh, yes.
We have to agree on what's real and not.
That's what holds us together.
What does Jennifer think is real?
She thinks the devil's coming for her.
Have we met before?
Only I forget.
They give me pills, you know, to make me even.
And I...
I forget things.
You didn't forget me.
I just came to see if you remembered a man named Butterfield.
Maybe. I...
That's okay.
What about Philip Swann?
I knew Swann.
He's a fucking liar.
Why is that?
He said he knew how to protect us.
But he didn't know anything.
He made us think it was over and done with.
What was?
I don't wanna think about it.
If I think about it, he'll... he'll hear me.
He'll find me.
Swann?
I told you. I don't want...
What is it?
Calm down.
No, he'll get me!
He's not... He's not...
Who's not gonna get you?
Nix. Nix.
- And he's the Puritan?
- Yes!
- And he's dead?
- No.
He's coming back.
He's digging his way out.
I'll take care of her now.
Jesus.
Billy. Harry D'Amour.
Listen.
Supposing I wanted to get into the repository at the Magic Castle.
There we go.
You done something like this before?
I've had my moments.
Hold that up.
- They've gotta have this place rigged.
- How?
It'll be something hokey.
Whoa!
Let's have a look around.
Butterfield's pal had this carved on his forehead.
Any idea what it is?
Nope.
What'd I tell you?
So fucking hokey.
What have we got here?
- Get the files.
- Fuck the files.
Billy, get the files!
Go on!
Jesus!
I could have lost my fucking hands!
That would have kept you out of the magic circle... which was presumably the idea.
Why don't you take a look through these?
Go on.
These must be about Nix.
The Puritan?
Look at that.
A Nix specialty?
I don't know any of these tricks.
Maybe they're not tricks.
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking the path between...
Trickery and divinity.
He's saying that all the time.
He said that because he knew.
Son of a bitch.
He'd seen these and he knew.
Knew what?
Get it off of me!
Where the fuck are you?
Hold it right there.
I said hold it...
Hokey enough for you?
I'm out of here, man.
Comin'?
Yeah.
I'm comin'.
I can't let you in.
This is the way he wanted it.
No autopsy... no embalming... nobody meddling with his body.
"Flesh is a trap," he used to say.
"Flesh is a trap... and magic sets us free."
Why did you come back?
I've been doing some digging.
What did you find?
Jennifer Desiderio, for one.
She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
Why don't you tell me the truth?
Nix ran some kind of a cult, right?
Some kind of a
Charlie Manson deal?
It was more than that, I think.
He was the real thing, wasn't he?
Swann said he could do stuff.
Like?
He could levitate, juggle fire... and he could get into people's heads... make them see things.
- Terrible things.
- What things?
I don't know.
- And he taught some of this to Swann?
- Yes, some of it.
So then, Swann wasn't performing illusions.
He was doing magic.
Yes.
What? You thought he should be using it to cure cancer... instead of making millions?
- Look, I told you.
- Right. I know. Too much fame.
That'd be enough to turn anybody's head, including yours.
Oh, fuck you.
You're the one who said you weren't with him for love.
I wasn't.
Then what?
What the hell was going on here?
- I was grateful to him.
- For what?
Everything I had I owed to him.
And he loved me.
He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he?
Didn't he?
I can't help you unless you talk to me!
- You can't help me.
- You don't know that!
I was so afraid.
Don't be.
Nix can't hurt you now.
I know.
I was the one who shot him.
I was 12.
Nix took me hostage to get Swann to come to him.
And they all came.
- Yeah.
- Quaid and Jennifer and...
Swann and Pimm.
What was that?
Valentin?
Wait!
What the hell?
It's him. It's Nix.
Dorothea, stay there.
Find Valentin!
Find him and get him in here. Now!
This is sacrilege.
Are you satisfied now?
Don't worry. I'm not hurting him.
Looks like you're not a widow after all.
Sit down.
You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
Yes.
You set up the fake body?
And then what?
Because I was getting too close to something or someone... you called Swann?
No. First I tried to pay you off.
Was it Swann's idea?
It was mine.
I didn't want any more bloodshed.
That's why we went to all this trouble.
So Nix would have no one to come after.
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake!
What is wrong with you people?
Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
I want to meet with
Swann face to face.
Why can't you just let this alone?
Let everyone think it's over.
Maybe he's right.
Maybe we should just let him stay dead.
Couldn't stay away, could you?
Had to see who cried over you the most, huh?
You know... a lot of people are gonna be pissed off when they find out you're still alive.
And they will, you know.
No matter how much shit you bury yourself under, you're gonna...
You shouldn't have followed me.
How do you do that?
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
I don't think so.
You need me alive.
Why? So you can fuck the woman I love?
If you love her so much, why did you widow her?
What a waste.
You can do shit that most of us can only dream about.
Then you go around pretending it's just some trick.
Illusionists get Las
Vegas contracts.
Magicians get burned.
Yeah, or murdered like Nix.
Oh, he deserved it.
Maybe he doesn't feel that way.
Maybe he's digging himself out of that hole you put him in right now.
That's what you're hiding away from, isn't?
I did it for Dorothea.
Yeah?
Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
- So Nix won't be looking for her.
- I betrayed him.
But she shot him. If I'm Nix, that'd piss me off a little bit.
I don't know what else to do.
Help me.
Look... if Nix is back from the dead... then he is some kind of a god... and he'll find you wherever the fuck you go.
But if he's just another phony messiah... then you can stage the greatest comeback in history.
Who's there?
Easy.
I've sometimes thought... if I'd had another profession...
I would have been a surgeon.
To be able to heal with one little cut.
Say that those eyes of yours were troubling you.
- Please.
- I could just scoop them out.
No, don't.
Then tell me where Nix is buried.
I don't know.
Wait! Wait!
I'll tell you.
Oh, you'll do more than that.
What is it?
Did Dorothea know where Nix was buried?
No.
Did Valentin?
Yes.
Do you like the look of these?
I made them myself... to set him free.
Why did you wait so long?
I didn't have the skill... to resurrect him... to teach myself.
That took time.
Think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect after 13 years?
If he was just a man... like me, then no... but he's not.
What is he, then?
Maybe he'll show you.
Anything?
Not yet.
- If you have lied to me...
- No, I swear!
This is the place
Swann told me about.
- The rocks...
- Five more minutes.
- Are you hearing me?
- I'm doing my best.
What have you got there?
Fucker!
Butterfield!
He's in the corner!
Don't touch him.
It's him.
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Smell it.
He's coming. He's coming.
He will come.
Help me!
Get out of the car.
Get out of the fuckin' car!
He's got Dorothea.
- And Nix?
- Yes.
- Don't bother about me.
- Shut up!
We've already lost enough lives.
Please accept my apologies, D'Amour.
For what?
You're going to lose one more.
No!
He's better off this way.
Nobody's better off this way.
You don't get it, do you?
This is where we're all goin'.
Do you wish him amongst us?
Yes.
Will you come unto him upon your knees?
Be ready.
Listen.
You got everything you want.
You don't need me.
No, but he will, after what you did to him.
He'll want vengeance.
Christ in heaven!
My lord.
He's coming home.
He's with us.
He's with us.
Hold her!
Open your eyes.
He's with us.
Where is Swann?
- He's dead.
- No, he isn't.
I swear.
Children.
Will you suffer to come unto me?
Jesus.
What the hell is goin' on in there?
At a guess, they just resurrected him.
Fuck!
I've come back to bring you the wisdom of the grave.
- Will you hear it?
- Yes.
Follow me.
Do I know you, child?
Yes.
I do, don't I?
No gun this time, child?
Where is Swann?
I don't know where he is.
He'll come.
We have unfinished business, he and I.
This is where we killed him.
Looks like you didn't try hard enough.
I can't go any further.
Where is she, you fuck, huh?
Are you ready for my wisdom?
Here is my wisdom.
Go! Help her!
You see, I escaped from the grave... so I have to give something to the grave in return.
Yes. Show us.
Show us, Puritan.
I have to give something back... so I'm giving you.
What's happening?
Go ahead, bleed.
Bleed!
What are you doing?
You're not worthy.
None of you.
Fuck you!
Only Swann is worthy.
You just waited like lambs.
I'm not your shepherd.
You're not Swann.
Who are you?
Oh, I know what you want.
Hold on!
Nix!
There you are.
Come on!
I've had a long time... to think about you.
Where did I go wrong?
And?
I should have been honest with you from the start.
I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.
I was born... to murder the world.
You can still help me do that if you want.
Why would I wanna do that?
The lady has a new love in her life.
Your friends are all dead.
No one can save you now... but me.
- Come on!
- We can't leave him there!
I'm not going to!
Bitch!
Butterfield!
Will you help me?
Yes.
Now you know I will kill you when we're done. I have to.
- Yes.
- But until then... it'll be just the two of us... the way it always was.
Yes.
Wait.
You still feel something for that bitch?
Yes.
Will... you... never... learn?
She's just flesh...
Swannie boy!
I'll show you.
Dorothea?
Dorothea?
Where is she?
Where did she go?
You've got Swann's disease.
You think that with a little courage and a little love... that it'll all be all right.
Tell me where she is and
I'll make it go away.
Dig, D'Amour.
Touch the darkness.
It's been waiting for you.
Harry, it's not real.
Now listen to me.
Look at me!
You'll be okay.
There you are, child.
Come along, child.
What are you seeing now?
There.
One... last... illusion.
What's it going to be?
- Fire to burn out your eyes?
- Let's go!
I'm sure Swann loved your eyes.
You shouldn't have taken him away from me.
We were going to be together... when I finished with the world.
We were going to keep each other company... in the dark.
But I'm on my own.
We're all on our own.
The grave is lonely.
But living is worse.
What the fuck are you?
A man who wanted to be a god... then changed his mind.
I'm going to be rotten shit from now on.
The car.
Can you raise me up like the car?
I'm going to show the world what's waiting at the end.
And I am going to make it... despair.
Fucker!
It's me.
Is it finished?
I think so.
Run.
Run!
And the fire said to me... said to me...
Hush!
You will see flesh with a god's eyes.
I was born... to murder the world.
"Flesh is a trap."
That's what he used to say.
"Flesh is a trap... and magic sets us free."
I'm not going to biteyou.
I'm sorry, sir.
You gave me a fright.
You're up very early.
I'm generally up by 5:00, sir.
Otherwise I get behind.
I used to be able to stay up all night and suffer no ill effects whatsoever.
Oh, well.
Those scars.
Would you mind ifI examine them?
It's a purely professional curiosity.
I don't really like to talk about them, sir, ifit's all the same toyou.
There are some on your neck as well.
They look almost like teeth marks.
Yes, sir, that's what they are.
Mary, you'll find an eel in the fish pantry.
Fetch it in for me, will you?
It's alive!
Warmth ofyour hands, that'll be, revived him.
Put him here.
Difficult buggers to kill, is eels.
Now, keep hold ofits tail.
Go on. Don't be soft.
Fetch the skinners.
- What's the matterwith you?
- I'm all right.
- You're as white as a sheet.
- Sorry.
Well, fetch us that big saucepan offthe range.
What's he do out there on his own all those hours?
He's after something.
I don't know.
Lastyear he used to give weekly lectures in that operating theater.
He had patients, like a regular doctor.
- And hejust stopped?
-Just like that.
From one day to the next.
Perhaps he's looking for a cure for something.
Yes. Forwhat ails him, ifhe's got any sense.
Shall I leave the candle a while, or doyou want to sleep?
I always want to sleep.
I can't understand why it takes so much effort to look after one man.
I don't mind hard work.
I do.
I've been in service since I was 1 2, and this is the best place I've had.
He's a kind man, the doctor.
Anyone can see that.
Ifhe was that kind, he'd let me sleep until 6:00.
Good night, then.
I feel safe here, is all.
Good morning, sir.
Mary, this is most welcome.
I'm ravenous.
I'm pleased, sir.
- I wasn't sure I should wakeyou.
- Why?
You can't have had much sleep, sir.
I heard you come in not three hours ago.
Last night I came to the end ofa very longjourney.
For months now
I have been engaged... in the driest kind ofstudy.
But last night all the barriers fell before me.
I have made a great breakthrough.
I'm very happy to hear it, sir.
Yesterday as I was passing,
I looked into the library... and thereyou were with your nose in a book.
I had no idea you were able to read.
I'm very sorry, sir.
You are most welcome to borrow any book ofmine that takes your fancy.
No. I wouldn't want the other servants to think I was getting above myself.
No. I can't eat any ofthis.
-I'll ask Mrs. Kent to coddle some eggs.
-No, that's all right.
Areyou quite sureyou don't want to tell me howyou got those scars?
I'm sorry. I won't askyou again.
Leave the tray.
Would you ask Poole... to organize the removal ofthat to my cabinet?
Yes, sir.
I hopeyou haven't been making a nuisance ofyourself, Mary.
No, sir. The doctor wasjust telling me... he wants his mirror moved to his cabinet.
Can you account forwhy the master... chose to issue these instructions through you?
No, sir. Except I told him
I'd heard him coming in late last night.
You did what?
You were in the master's bedroom some considerable time.
What else did he say toyou?
We talked about doing something with the garden.
The garden?
It's gloomy out there.
I thought we could plant a flower bed.
Who's going to do all this?
I would. I don't mind.
Aren't we finding enough work foryou?
I could do it on my afternoons off.
My last place in the country--
We're familiarwith your reminiscences, Mrs. Kent.
The master used to send for one ofthe housemaids every morning, 9:00... regular as clockwork.
In the end, she fell in the familyway... and was dismissed without a reference.
I often wonder what become ofher.
I expect now she entertains gentlemen all hours ofthe day.
- Bradshaw.
- Yes, Mr. Poole?
Saveyour breath to cool your porridge.
Yes, Mr. Poole.
What areyou doing?
Mr. Poole doesn't allow me in the theater, sir.
- Does he not?
- Mirror's in place, sir.
Thankyou.
Mary tells us you've been holding a discussion with her about the garden.
Remind me what conclusion we arrived at, Mary.
Flower beds there... and at the corners... and a herb garden here by the kitchen.
The very thing.
Just what we need.
Oh, Poole, would you gather the staff in the dining room at about 6:00?
- I have an announcement to make.
- Sir.
As I'm sureyou're all aware... the pressure ofmywork has increased considerably oflate.
Consequently, I have decided to take on an assistant.
His name is Mr. Edward Hyde... and I intend to give him the run ofthe house.
Ofcourse, as a rule, he will come and go... by the side door ofmy laboratory.
But when he does have the occasion to step over here...
I trustyou will treat him with the same respect thatyou've always shown me.
You may rely on it.
Will the gentleman be taking his meals here, sir?
Not as a rule, no.
There really is no cause for concern.
He is a quite remarkable young man.
He's a solitary one, isn't he, the doctor?
Ayear or two back he used to have dinner parties.
- Then hejust stopped.
- Shame.
Oh, no.
Best thing ever happened.
Think ofthe washing up.
And he's never had any sort of... a lady friend?
Never a woman stepped in the front door.
Not since I've been here.
- Strange.
- Bradshaw says he goes to houses.
What?
Bradshaw says he goes to houses.
What doyou mean?
You know.
Houses.
I can't believe that.
You best get offifyou're going.
I'll finish up here.
Thanks.
Sir?
Yes?
It was very good ofyou, sir, to back me up about the garden.
Yes, I think I did ratherwell.
Mr. Poole questioned me so closely about... why I was so long with you this morning.
It was the only excuse
I could think of.
So, thankyou.
Areyou sure he's not out on the landing right now, the virtuous Poole?
No, sir.
He's gone to bed.
I thought, ifyou would like to examine these scars--
Come here.
Raiseyour sleeve.
These go very deep.
Did they never affect the use ofyour fingers?
I couldn't move my thumb for a while, but it gradually came back to working.
Does it still causeyou any pain?
Gives me a bit ofgyp when the weather's damp. Otherwise it's right as rain.
What did this?
Come.
Sit down.
- No, sir.
- I insist.
- Something to drink, perhaps?
- No, sir.
So, how did it happen?
It was a punishment, sir.
You done that on purpose, didn'tyou?
No, sir.
What doyou think?
I'm made ofmoney?
You careless little bitch.
I'm going out now, Mary, to see what I can find.
He was gone some time.
He had a strange way ofwalking, not exactly a limp.
Buthis footsteps--
Well, Ialways knewit washim.
It was like... everystep was calling myname.
Areyou still there, Mary?
I found you something to keepyou company.
We wouldn't wantyou getting lonely now, would we?
Was it a rat?
Yes, sir.
He knew the way
I felt about them.
HeknewIcouldn'tabide even theidea ofthem.
And he knew, sooner or later, it was--
Going to bite its way through.
Bite its way through.
Where was your mother all this time?
She was working.
Shenevergothome tilllate.
She tookmeaway that verynight... triedto decide what to do forthebest... and thought I'd be safest ifshe put me into service.
What happened to him?
I never seen him again from that day to this.
It is a terrible story, Mary.
I can see whyyou were so reluctant to tell it to me.
Thankyou for... being so candid.
I shan't forget it.
I must go to my laboratory.
There's something I need to do.
You're up early this morning, sir.
As a matter offact, I didn't go to bed at all last night.
- You've been out, by seeing your shoes.
- Yes. I needed some fresh air.
I was thinking a great deal about the storyyou told me last night.
You must have really hated your father.
I don't know, sir.
Surely he was a monster.
When I was little and he was in work, he wasn't so bad then.
It was the drinking that did it.
You think it was only the drink?
The drink turned him into a different man.
A different man?
He even looked different.
What doyou mean?
It was like he carried another person inside him... and the drinking brought him out.
Or maybe set him free.
I'd likeyou to do something for me in strictest confidence.
I wantyou to deliver this letter.
I expectyou know where that is.
There'll be no reply other than a yes or a no.
- Very good, sir.
- You'll do it then?
Ifyou want me to, sir.
Thankyou, Mary.
Haven'tyou everwished for a completely new life, Mary?
No, sir.
What good would that do?
Supposeyou were able to do absolutelywhateveryou wanted... with no consequences and no regrets.
Then what?
I don't believe there is such a thing as actions without consequences.
Strictly speaking,
I've no vacancies at the moment.
We might be able to come to some particular arrangement.
- Areyou Mrs. Farraday?
- Who wants to know?
I have a letter from Dr.Jekyll.
- HarryJekyll, eh?
- Areyou--
Yes, I'm Farraday.
Keepyourwool on. Come inside.
Dear old Harry.
Ever the good Samaritan.
Not required in the House ofCommons, Sir Danvers?
I imagine they can rub along without me this once, Mrs. Farraday.
And vice versa,
I shouldn't wonder.
Sir Danvers is one ofour most prominent spokesmen on foreign affairs.
- Aren'tyou, Sir Danvers?
- You're too kind, Mrs. Farraday.
Got any questions on any sort ofexotic customs...
Sir Danvers is your man.
Well, perhaps
I've been a bit hasty.
No, no. She's not even an apprentice. Notyet.
Oh, pity.
- Mary!
- Yes?
I look forward to meeting you in due course.
You rub along for as long as you like, Sir Danvers.
Or as long as you can manage.
I'll say this for HarryJekyll:
He may ask for a few special services... but he doesn't mind paying top whack.
So I'm to say your answer is yes?
My answer's always yes.
I have my obligations, tell him.
It'll take me a week to clear out the present tenant, then anotherweek... to make these alterations he's asking for.
Then his assistant can move in.
Can't say I've ever noticed him in need ofany assistant.
Well?
She said yes, but she said she needs two weeks to get it ready.
Hard on myyoung man.
No hardship to stay away from that place.
He's robust enough, and he needs to live within easy reach ofthe hospital.
- Where is he living at the moment?
- Why doyou ask?
No one in the house has seen him.
He comes and goes during the night.
Now I think that will be all.
- I've seen him!
- Yes, hejust crossed the bridge.
But I couldn't really make him out.
What was he like?
He moves funny.
Not so much a limp.
More ofa shuffle.
And he's sort ofstooped.
- Did you see his face?
- No.
Just his eyes.
He came outofthe dark... likehe wasmade ofit.
- What's this, the mother's meeting?
- No, Mr. Poole.
Come here.
Closer.
Closer.
What am I going to do with you?
You should have no trouble cashing this.
I thinkwe've had enough excitement for one evening.
Close the door behind you.
My lord, sir, what haveyou done?
- It's all right.
- Is it broken?
No, it's only a sprain.
I shall need helping into the house.
Shall I fetch your assistant?
What? I'm sor--
What did you say?
I thought I heard him... moving around the house last night.
Ifhe were there, doyou suppose he'd leave me to crawl out here on my own?
I'm sorry, sir.
Ifyou'll allow me to lean on you...
I'm sure the thing can be accomplished.
You've been working too hard, sir.
I'm not surprised you had an accident.
- What's going on?
- The master's had an accident.
Why didn'tyou come for me?
Hold your tongue. Go upstairs and light the bedroom fire. Bradshaw.
I was out late last night.
I must have... somehow put myweight on it.
Dr.Jekyll is all too benevolent an employer.
So it falls to me to draw attention to occasions... when I feel members ofthe household are failing in their duties.
It is also my task, may I remind you... to dismiss those staffwho persistently overstep the mark.
Yes, sir.
Haveyou any idea to what I may be referring?
It was not my place to advise the master not to work.
Quite so. Now help me on with my Ulster.
The master requires certain supplies from the chemist.
Naturally, we're all concerned when Dr.Jekyll is unwell.
We are hardly likely to improve his condition... by drawing attention to our own entirely insignificant opinions.
You must be aware there are a great manyyoung women... in straitened circumstances who could fill your position... and observe a few elementary regulations.
Remember that.
- Mary.
- Yes, sir?
When we had our talk, you refused to sayyou hated your father.
I don't.
Why not?
He put a dark place in me, and I can't forgive him for that.
But it's part ofme now, and how can I regret what I am?
Though it often makes me sad.
Oh, well, sadness, yes.
That can't be helped.
That comes in like the tide.
I knowyou're afraid ofrats.
You told me.
But what else areyou afraid of?
I don't know, sir.
Bad dreams.
- I see.
- Confined spaces.
Yes, ofcourse.
But whatyou're saying is, you're never afraid ofyourself.
I didn't say that.
You are afraid ofyourself?
Yes.
I thought so.
God, Mary.
I'm so cold.
My hands are frozen through.
Take some broth, sir.
I don't know, Mary.
Why is ityou strike me as you do?
Get some warmth intoyou, sir.
I'm very tired.
Will you get dressed? There's something
I need you urgently to do for me.
What's all this about?
How should I know? You'll have to do the blackleading for me this morning.
I'm afraid this won't be a very pleasant errand.
- Is it to Mrs. Farraday?
- It is.
And I can't tell you how important it may be.
Come in here!
He won't slip out ofthis one with a few quid and a smarmy letter.
All the same, you'd better read it.
He ought to have the courage to come here hisself... and clean up after that mad dog ofhis.
- He said there might be a reply.
- And so there might.
Come with me.
In you go.
Don't even ask.
What shall I tell him?
Tell him no need to panic.
I'll do anything he wants.
And you take this home with you to HarryJekyll.
What am I supposed--
Ah, yes, it takes all sorts.
You tell HarryJekyll this is such linen... as even his old friend Mrs. Farraday can't clean for him!
You've taken your time. The master's waiting foryou, in the laboratory.
Go there directly.
The rule is relaxed.
And shiftyourself!.
What did she say?
She said she'll do everything you want her to.
But she said this is such linen as even she cannot clean.
She has always been prone to exaggeration.
I saw the room.
There was blood on the ceiling.
And did Mrs. Farraday explain?
No, sir. But I felt sure someone had been torn to death in that room.
No.
- She said you should've goneyourself.
- I couldn't.
I'm sureyou understand.
A place like that.
I sent my assistant, Mr. Hyde.
She called him a mad dog.
On those rare occasions... when a woman like Mrs. Farraday is not at fault herself... she is liable to experience a rush ofrighteous indignation.
I happen to know that Mr. Hyde... did everything that he could.
The girl had already lost too much blood.
These amateur operations, as I'm sureyou--
Well, let's not discuss the details.
Just rest assured that I shall continue... to look into the matter.
I suppose it would have been too much to expect a bit ofgratitude.
I'm sorry I doubted you, sir.
I'm going to lock my door and work.
Tell Poole he may close up as he pleases.
I may not go back into the house tonight.
Mary Reilly.
Doyou know who I am?
You're Mr. Hyde, the master's assistant.
You may say so.
What doyou think?
I always had an artistic temperament.
I know I owe my existence to science, but...
I've never been able to whip up much enthusiasm for it.
Strange... the thoughts that come unbidden, don'tyou find?
Ifyou mean we're not always in control ofour ideas--
Why should we want to be?
That's the question.
I've never been in favor ofcontrol.
By all accounts, your fatherwas no paragon at controlling himself.
Men will chatter amongst themselves in a--
What I wasn't able to find out was how far it might have gone... between your father and yourself.
Didn'tyou look forward to them sometimes... those evenings when your motherwas out working?
Still, wouldn'tyou like to come in town with me tonight?
Good morning, Mary.
- Morning.
- What's the matter?
I thought, sir, when we spoke ofprivate matters... those were confidences you would never repeat.
I'm afraid you've been upset by my assistant.
No, sir. I was more upset byyou thatyou told him.
As a doctor, I've always been in the habit... oftaking notes after any kind ofconsultation.
I'm afraid myyoung man is less scrupulous than he should be.
He read my notebook.
I see, sir.
Well, in that case--
I can't deny that his manners are rough, but I've learned to look beyond that.
I know he likes you very much.
I see no reason whyyou shouldn't become the best offriends.
As a matter offact, I was hoping you would accompany him... this afternoon on a scientific errand.
I thought it might make a break from this perpetual housework.
Ofcourse, I'll send Bradshaw ifyou prefer.
And now, to where they butcher human meat.
This hospital and the slaughterhouse share the same gutters.
Most convenient.
Youjust can't say no to our employer, can you?
And you believe everyword he says?
The doctor's been very kind to me.
He's much too old foryou, ofcourse.
I don't know whatyou mean.
I keep telling him he works too hard.
Areyou aware, when you're with him, ofhow much he longs to touch you?
Ofcourse not.
He conceals it that well, does he?
I don't want to talk about this.
Whateveryou say.
It is difficult to understand someone who is entirely incapable... ofsimply asking forwhat he most wants in the world, don'tyou agree?
How can you presume to know what goes on in the doctor's mind?
Inspired guesswork.
Instinct. Fellow feeling.
- What does he want them for?
- I've never bothered to ask.
I just supply the organs as required.
You've no idea how strange and twisting... are the ways ofscience.
Wait there.
Afternoon, Doctor.
Visit from the butcher.
What's that?
He can't tell why, Mary, but the doctor feels a bit hungry.
Tea and sandwiches, perhaps.
For two, sir?
Why not?
Dr.Jekyll and Mr. Hyde would like some tea.
How doyou get on with that Mr. Hyde then?
He manage to keep his hands to hisself?
You shouldn'tjudge everyone byyour own standards, Mr. Bradshaw.
Well, I hope Hyde was politer toyou than he was to old Poole.
-What doyou mean?
-Beforeyou went off, he sent for Poole.
He tells him to get on the train... go offto some chemist way out in the country.
And when Poole says, ''Is there anything else I can do foryou, sir?''
He says, ''Yes. Mind your own business,'' and slams the door in his face.
Mr. Poole was that upset.
I wouldn't cross him in the next day or two ifI was you.
He said to me,
'' No matter how well he speaks...
Mr. Hyde could never be mistaken for a gentleman.''
Who is he then?
You ask me, he's got one over on the doctor. You know, a spot ofblackmail.
Or, tell you what, maybe he's a souvenir... from the doctor's student days, sort ofa grown-up wild oat.
Now they do look a bit alike.
Mary don't like to think the doctor's ever had any fun in his life.
Mary, you go.
Oh, it's you, is it?
Butler's night off, is it?
- What doyou want?
- A word with the gentleman.
- Which one?
- HarryJekyll, ofcourse.
IfI never saw that other devil again in my life, it'd be too soon for me.
- They're both in the laboratory.
- That'll do as well as anywhere.
As a rule, the doctor doesn't admit visitors when he's working.
Oh, I think he'll admit me.
Very likely he'll admit both ofus ifyou playyour cards right.
Wait here.
What is it?
Mrs. Farraday is here to seeyou, sir.
- Who?
- Mrs. Farraday.
- What doyou want?
-Just a word.
Thought we might have a chat about improving our financial arrangements.
Staywhereyou are.
I'll be with you in a moment.
There's something
I have to do first.
Don't be too long.
It ain't very festive down here.
- I'll bring the tea in a minute, sir.
- What?
- Mr. Hyde ordered tea and sandwiches.
- Cancel the tea.
Hold your horses.
I'm parched.
I'm sureyou'd prefer something stronger.
It won't take me a moment to prepare it.
Have ityour own way.
Doctor?
Doctor?
Doctor?
I'm very sorry to disappointyou, but it isn't the doctor.
He chivalrously insisted on seeing
Mrs. Farraday all the way home.
He told me he couldn't go to that house.
She's moved.
- Will there be anything else, sir?
- Yes. There will be.
Come here.
There has been something
I've been trying to say toyou... ever since our first conversation in the library.
Yes, sir?
I--
I want to apologize for some ofthe things I said.
Why?
Because...
I was unnecessarily... offensive.
Now lookwhat you've made me do.
Don'tyou know who I am?
Mary Reilly.
Sorry. Must be some misunderstanding.
I thoughtyou invited me here.
I did.
What's the matterwith you?
I'm sorry. Bad dream.
Didn't sound too bad.
Yes?
Mrs. Kent tells me that while I was awayyesterday... you had some dealings with the master's assistant.
Yes, sir.
Did you hold much conversation with him?
No, sir.
But I understand a cup was broken.
That's right.
How did that happen?
- I dropped it, sir.
- You dropped it?
- On the carpet?
- No, sir.
- It landed on the fender, sir.
- I see.
- It should be stopped from yourwages.
- Yes, sir.
I'll discuss it with the master.
You may go.
Poole tells meyou've confessed to breaking a cup.
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.
After the storyyou told me aboutyour father, I can't understand... howyou could ever bring yourself to sayyou've broken a cup.
Especiallywhen you didn't do it.
Yes, sir.
I can't rightly understand it myself.
I'm sorryyou don't care for Mr. Hyde.
- Who told you that, sir?
- Well, you don't, doyou?
He troubles me, sir.
Leave me.
- May I open it, Mr. Poole?
- Verywell. Be quick about it.
What is it, Mary?
Is it bad news?
My mum's passed away.
Mary, you come and sit down a minute.
We'll makeyou a nice cup oftea.
This is from her landlord.
Says she owes him money for the rent.
Now, don'tyou worry. Mr. Poole will speak to the master, won'tyou?
Yes. I'll take up the breakfast today.
Yes. And then you can see to things yourself.
I've got my savings.
Nearly eight pounds.
Would that be enough to pay for a proper funeral?
Why isn't she in her room?
Well, you see,
I've a heavy demand for my rooms.
Long waiting list.
- Where haveyou put her?
- She's quite comfortable.
Very snug really.
Now, the parish will provide the expenses ofthe burial.
No. I want her to have a proper funeral. I can pay.
Then let me takeyou to a first-class undertaker ofmy acquaintance.
Thankyou. I prefer to make my own arrangements.
And did you say you were also owed money?
I took the liberty ofselling off... her few bits offurniture and crockery and clothes... which, I'm very pleased to say, cleared offher debt completely.
And, let me see... yes, a shilling over.
A poorwage for a lifetime's drudgery.
Very true, miss.
This is a vale oftears.
What haveyou done?
You have a wonderful knack for being in the right place at the right time.
Why areyou about at this hour ofthe night?
- My mother died.
- Oh, yes, I heard.
Oh, well.
She's not the only one.
Now I'm afraid I must make good my escape.
I supposeyou'll never see me again.
- Areyou the housemaid, Mary Reilly?
- Yes.
This way.
- Mary Reilly?
- Yes, sir.
Where haveyou been?
My mother's died, sir.
I had some arrangements to make.
And when did you last see the doctor's assistant, Mr. Edward Hyde?
Some time ago, sir.
Not in the last 24 hours?
No, sir.
Another question.
Areyou acquainted with a friend ofthe doctor's... a member of Parliament,
Sir Danvers Carew?
What areyou up to?
I don't believe so, sir.
But I understand he was a regular dinner guest here at the house.
Reilly is the most recently engaged member ofthe domestic staff.
I don't believe Sir Danvers has dined here since her arrival.
I see.
Ifyou'll oblige us,
Mr. Poole... we'd like to search the doctor's laboratory.
I don't believe there's anyone out there, sir.
Will you not interfere in matters which do not concern you?
You'd best ask the doctoryourself.
May I be ofsome assistance, gentlemen?
IfI had anywhere else to go, you wouldn't see me for dust.
The police found nothing here or in the laboratory.
This place is goin' to the dogs.
Murder now, ifyou please.
He always gave me the creeps, that Hyde.
What's to stop him coming back here and skewering us when we're in our beds?
He won't do that.
You know him well, doyou?
Come on to bed.
Still feel safe here?
I don't know what I feel anymore.
Well, I'd watch me back ifI was you.
- Mary?
- Yes, sir?
Would you step in here a moment.
I want to speak toyou.
- Mr. Poole--
- Never mind Mr. Poole.
Put those down.
- You saw him yesterday.
- I did, sir.
- You told the policeyou had not. Why?
- I don't really know, sir.
Doyou know that whatyou've done has madeyou an accessory to murder?
Not telling the police everything you know is a criminal offense.
I know that, sir.
My God.
I was at school with him.
He was corrupt and frivolous, but he didn't deserve that.
And he is an important man, not easily swept under the carpet.
Not like the others.
What others, sir?
- What others?
- There were others.
Where is he?
Last night he walked in on me as bold as brass.
He wanted money to make good his escape.
I made him promise to disappear and never show his face again.
What is it you owe this man?
Why areyou prepared to risk everything trying to protect him?
It's myselfI'm trying to protect.
And as far as what I owe him, as strange as it may sound...
Edward Hyde has liberated me.
I no longer care what the world may think ofme.
It is marvelous how much he loves his life.
And his victims, sir.
Did they not love theirs?
Not as he does.
Not so ravenously.
Sir?
Sir?
I trustyou as I trust no one, Mary.
My life would be a sad thing ifI--
What is it?
He is impatient.
Therefore, do we now commit the body... ofour departed sister to the ground.
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
I wanted to make a contribution... towards the expense ofthe funeral.
Lookin' well.
And settled in service in a big house.
- So I've been told.
- Who told you?
- Your mother.
- When?
Oh, I've seen a bit ofher the past couple ofyears.
She wasn't one to bear a grudge.
I wasjust thinking... ifyou and I couldn't get together again sometime?
The doctor tells me I'm not likely to live through the winter.
Here. This must've costyou six months' wages.
You keep it.
Why not? My money's as good as anyone's.
Haveyou no heart at all?
I'm your father.
Haveyou no feelings for me?
We had our good times, didn't we?
Wehadsomegoodtimes.
Youremember?
Mustremember.
Did you miss me?
You promised the master you'd go away.
Easier said than done, as it turns out.
- What did you do to him?
- Betteryou askwhat he has done to me.
The truth is,
I am your master.
- What doyou mean?
- I mean I am the bandit.
He is merely the cave in which I shelter.
- Where areyou going?
- To raise the alarm.
Last week, you saved my life.
Nowyou want to send me to the gallows?
Can you explain?
Can you?
I feel differentlywith you.
Why should that be?
You still the rage.
Where does it come from, sir?
This rage.
How should I know?
It comes in like the tide.
Now areyou beginning to understand?
Foryears now the doctor has been suffering from a strange malady.
He experimented with manyways to keep it at bay.
But it would always return more acute than ever.
Finally, he distilled two drugs... tested them, and understood that he had found the cure... which took an unexpected form.
What form?
Me.
I was the cure.
The first formula transformed him into me.
The second formula-- which he always refers to... rather insultingly,
I can't help feeling, as the antidote-- transforms me back into him.
Lately, I've found a way to slip his leash.
To become myselfwithout having to wait for the injection.
How?
Presumably, because
I am the stronger.
Is evil stronger than good?
You tell me.
Please let me go.
I am sorry. I thought you were planning to stay a while.
But perhaps my sense ofsmell deceives me.
Where areyou going, Mary?
The master's asked me to bring him something from the laboratory.
I'll take care ofthat.
- He particularly asked I do it myself.
- I will do it!
You don't know what he wants.
Please don't interfere.
And he's not to be disturbed for the rest ofthe morning.
- Mary?
- Yes, Mr. Poole?
I wantyou to go and wait in my parlor.
I have something to say toyou.
Yes, Mr. Poole.
- Poole. Thereyou are.
- Yes, sir, I--
I wantyou to payvery close attention to what I say.
You must make anothervisit to Finlay and Sons.
I'm very much afraid theywon't be--
Will you listen to what I'm saying beforeyou start raising objections?
Three or four months ago they prepared this at my instruction.
There must have been some impurity in the compound because since then... neither they nor any ofthe other chemists has been able to reproduce it.
You must ask them to analyze this precisely... and then wait on the premises... until they succeed in reconstituting it.
Tell them that this is a matter ofthe greatest urgency.
Life and death.
I will, sir.
Mary, will you come with me?
At least there is someone in this house I can rely on.
I didn't know ifI could believe what he was saying.
But it's true, isn't it?
I kept thinking you must know we were the same man.
How could anyone know such a thing?
How could anyone possibly guess?
I wantyou to do something for me.
I wantyou to go now to my laboratory... and make up a bed.
That is where I'll need to spend most ofmy time from now on.
- Shall I take this with me?
- No!
Sir?
He said you have an illness.
What kind ofan illness?
You might call it a fracture in my soul.
Something which... left me with a taste for oblivion.
You should've seen him.
Shuffling across the courtyard.
Hanging onto that drawer like he thought someone wanted to take it offhim.
Poor Mr. Poole, run offhis feet.
And he's not looking verywell on it either.
I'm afraid the master's been put out ofpatience.
As I feared, his new consignment ofmedicine is not at all satisfactory.
There are a number ofbroken bottles in the operating theater.
I'll go and clear it up,
Mr. Poole.
Never mind.
Leave it till the morning.
Best to get it done now.
Doctor?
Is thatyou?
Who is that?
What stops me from killing you?
I always knewyou'd be the death ofus.
He took pity on me.
Seems he took pity on me as well.
He mixed something with the antidote.
A poison.
Another cruel trick to take his life and leaveyou behind to suffer.
It was the onlyway he could devise to setyou free.
It was inevitable from the moment...
I found how to achieve what I'd always wanted; to be the knife as well as the wound.
Would you have ever forgiven me?
I wanted the night, you see.
And here it is.
You said... you didn't care what the world thought ofyou.
Norwill I.
I did it, Jack. I did it.
And you know what? It got me hot.
No, I'm not kidding.
You should have seen the look on Carl's face... when I buried that ax in his chest.
Oh! Killing him was almost better than sex.
I said almost, didn't I?
Oh! We are going to have so much fun spending all of his money, aren't we, baby?
Oh! Just thinking about it gets me all hot and squishy.
You mean right now?
He's in the basement cooling off.
What took you so long?
Jesus, Jack, what kind of cologne...
Cut!
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut!
What the hell are you doing?
You call that "hack-ting"?
Well, yes, I do call it acting.
Well, let me tell you something, pal.
You're no "Gorey" Cooper.
You ain't even a Robert "Deadford".
Another take like that and it'll be back to bit parts for you.
And I won't say what bits I'm talking about.
Huh! All right, everybody. Reset!
- Reset, guys. Back to one.
- Director...
Where the hell did they dig this guy up?
I give and I give and I... Oh!
Hello, kiddies.
So glad you could join me.
Your old pal the Crypt Keeper has gone Hollywood in a big way.
Care to see what I've been working on?
So if you're ready, creeps, fasten your drool cups... and hold on to your vomit bags.
We're going to the movies.
Frights! Camera! Action!
I call this one...
"Demon Knight".
Come on!
Son of a bitch!
Come on, you son of a bitch!
Shit!
Damn!
What ya doin', mister?
Are you stealing my daddy's car?
Stealin'?
No, I was testing the lock.
Seems to be working just fine.
Hey, kid. You want a quarter?
How about a shiny new quarter?
You want one? Come on.
Dad, there's a guy outside stealing your car!
Hey, Dad, hurry up! Get out here!
Shit!
- Homer, go!
- He's gone!
Boy, listen to that thunder.
God's doing some serious thinking tonight.
I'll bet he's saying:
On second thought, maybe I should have given it all to the monkeys."
- Maybe it's not to late.
- I always hate drinking alone.
You want a taste?
Sure.
To the monkeys.
It ain't very subtle, but it does the trick.
You wouldn't happen to know of a place where I could bed down, would you?
Well, it just so happens, I do.
- That's two cars, Sheriff?
- That's right, Mavis.
One of 'em's got Maryland plates, and the other one's from New Jersey.
- Ten-four?
- Ten-four.
You were right, Sheriff.
Them sons of bitches must have been doing well over a hundred.
Well, Bob, it's too late to give them a ticket.
But, if it'll make you feel any better, you can shoot their ashes.
What the...
Holy shit!
Hey, mister, get away from there.
- Where the hell you come from?
- This is my car.
Was my car. Did you see him?
Walking into town, the guy I was chasing?
Air bags, gotta love 'em.
Did you see him?
- We didn't see anybody.
- Now wait a minute.
Are you telling me that guy over there walked out of here too?
Where you goin'?
You got a few questions to answer.
Look, Officers, the man I'm chasing is dangerous.
If he's in your town, you got a problem.
We stand here arguing about a traffic accident... Do you mind?
Something awful's about to go down... over there.
Is that where we're going?
It looks like a church.
That's it. Used to be a church.
Ain't a church no more.
They decommissioned it in the 50s, due to lack of interest.
Just the place I've been looking for.
Gangway, I'm bringing in business.
- What kind of business?
- Well...
I think he's looking for a room of his own, Cordelia.
- You been drinking, Uncle Willy?
- You must be kiddin'.
- I'm clean as a whistle, Irene.
- How long you wanting the room?
I don't know.
One night, maybe two. Depends.
I never rent short-term, and I don't rent to strangers.
But I... can make exceptions.
Okay.
Enjoy your stay, Mister...
Mr. Smith.
Jeryline! Jeryline!
Jeryline, I mean now!
Look, Irene.
I'm trying to clean your stove.
How do you expect me to get my work done if you keep bothering me?
You've been working so hard with them clean rubber gloves?
Show Mr. Smith up to number five.
Shit...
And then fix him some dinner.
And after that, I got a few more jobs for you.
This time I'm gonna watch you.
I want it right the first time, and that's all there is to it.
It's my way or the highway.
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.
Alright, let's see...
What do I need to tell you?
What am I looking at?
Which way is town?
Town is that way, and you're looking at nothing.
But I'm sure you didn't come here for a view, did you?
But here's your key.
And the concierge will bring up your bags momentarily.
I don't see how they could fire you, Wally.
That's what I told them.
They don't listen to me.
Cordelia, I don't know what happened to all that mail.
It just disappeared, but they won't believe me.
God! It's so humiliating.
Do you know what he did?
Postmaster comes in... and he rips my name tag right off my shirt.
Right in front of everybody.
And like that's not bad enough... he took my Mr. Zippy patch.
You should have told your damn boss to go screw himself.
Stupid post office.
Ain't the only job in town.
The hell it ain't.
If you had any sense, Wally... you'd crawl back to him and beg for the job.
Yeah, well, I already tried that.
He said no.
Oh, poor Wally.
Where is that girl? Jeryline!
- What is it?
- Are my sheets done yet?
They're downstairs.
And I couldn't get all those stains out, either.
Damn guacamole.
Will you put them on my bed for me?
Why can't you do it yourself?
You know I'm busy.
Jeryline, get her sheets, will you?
No, I just started that stove.
I can't do everything at once.
- I'll get them for you, Cordelia.
- Good. Damn.
That's very sweet of you, Wally.
- Put them on your bed?
- Thanks.
Oh, poor guy.
Maybe I should give him a freebie.
Just what he needs, someone else screwing him.
To be perfectly honest,
I wasn't watching the speedometer.
- Exactly why were you chasing him?
- He's a thief.
What the hell did he steal that had you going over 100 miles an hour?
- Must have been pretty valuable.
- It is.
- Sheriff?
- Yeah, Mavis, go ahead.
We just got a call from Homer over at the café.
He says somebody tried to steal his car.
Okay, we're on it.
- You want some?
- Hell, no.
I was just thinking how much better that stuff looked when it was roadkill.
Why don't you shut up? You eat it.
She loves me.
You hurry up and finish... and I'll take care of dessert.
Ah, don't worry.
Good Cleo knows better than to eat that slop.
Goddamn it!
Get that pussy off the table.
I meant the cat.
Cleo!
- Didn't I tell you to put him out?
- I did.
I don't know how she got back in.
You finish cleaning the stove, or you too busy shooting the breeze?
For Christ's sake,
I'll finish cleaning it tomorrow.
I want it clean tonight.
Remind me of that program you're on.
It's called "work release", ain't it?
I swear that girl ain't got no goddamn gratitude.
If I hadn't made a place for her, she'd be behind bars or dead.
Lucky kid.
You expecting somebody, Mr. Smith?
Evenin', motel people.
You kept me waiting, Roach, honey.
I'll tell you the reason I'm late.
Somebody tried to steal Homer's car.
- You're kiddin'? That old hunk of junk?
- Yeah. Right out of the diner parking lot.
Sheriff and Deputy Dipshit showed up too.
- Damn, you look sweet.
- Thank you, honey.
You know, I've been looking forward to this all week.
- That makes two of us.
- Hey, what are those panties you got on there?
- I got the cherry flavor.
- Are those edible panties?
You know I want pieces of panty in my salad later.
Oh, Roach, you're so dirty!
Why don't you set the basket by the steps, Wally?
She's gonna be needing clean sheets soon enough.
Your boy did the right thing.
You should be...
Okay, Homer. That about covers it.
We'll let you know if we hear anything.
Sheriff, you there?
Go ahead, Mavis.
I just got a call from Irene at the mission...
- about that fellow you're looking for.
- Let's go, Sheriff.
Get in.
He's really holding on tonight, isn't he?
Okay.
So what were you in for?
I'm not passing judgment.
Stealin'. 'Kay?
- Good evening, Irene. Where is he?
- That's him, in the dining room.
Excuse me, mister.
We'd like to have a word with you about the fender bender on the highway.
Sheriff, you better watch it.
He's armed.
- Don't move!
- Told you.
- Drop the guns, or I'll kill her.
- Don't!
I said, drop your goddamn guns.
- He won't do it.
- The hell I won't.
I know this man, sheriff, and he will not do it.
Drop the knife. Drop the goddamn knife!
Her blood's on your head, asshole.
Spread 'em!
Well, well, well. Mr. Brayker.
- Pleased to make your acquaintance.
- You lyin' son of a bitch.
Said his name was Smith.
Call it in, Bob.
I believe you'll find what
I'm looking for in there.
- What's he got to do with this?
- I'm... I work for a collection agency.
- It's empty.
- Really? That can't be.
Well, I guess that means it's somewhere in the house.
- Keep him away from me!
- Shut up!
- Where is it?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
Don't give me that shit! Where is it?
Maybe it's up in his room.
What you guys looking for?
- What the hell are we looking for anyway?
- A piece of antiquity.
A relic... in the shape of a key.
Bob!
- Yeah?
- Search his room.
It's number five.
Oh. Come on, baby. Come on.
Crank me up. Come on.
Come on. Give it to me. Come on.
Give it to me. Come on. Come on.
Give it to me. Come one. Crank me up.
More juice.
- Come on. Oh, God!
- Is that good?
Freeze.
Jesus Christ, Bob, you son of a bitch!
- Turn it off! Turn it off!
- I'm sorry, baby.
Oh! My nipples are smoking!
Get your clothes on. Now!
- Good work, Mavis.
- Looky, looky.
Go ahead and do it.
I didn't find anything in the perp's room... but I sure found something in the room down the hall.
Thanks, Mavis.
Sorry to drag you down here, but we'll sort this thing out... and then you can get back to your business.
I am assuming it was personal business, Cordelia.
Actually, Sheriff... it was kind of like a tune up and lube job.
- Shut up, Bob!
- I don't want to hear about it.
- You know how it is when you get your car...
- I don't want to hear it.
Shut up, Bob.
This Brayker fella's getting more interesting.
According to the computer,
Frank Brayker died over five years ago.
Who the hell are you?
What's your name?
Maybe if you cool your heels in a jail cell... you'll be a little more chatty.
Come on, Bob.
Help me get him to the car.
Actually, sheriff...
I'd appreciate getting back what he stole from me.
That way I can get on my way... and you can give this lowlife what he deserves.
Why don't you tell us where you put it?
You make it easy for me,
I'll make it easy for you.
- Mind you, you're off to a pretty bad start.
- I know where it is!
Damn, it just occurred to me. I watched him stash it and didn't even know it.
- Willy, no!
- Relax!
I'm sorry, mister.
I'd like you to put it inside.
Look what he's done.
He's put somethin' awful inside.
Would you mind dumping that out before you place it inside?
- Sure.
- No, don't do it.
He's not what he says he is.
Willy... Willy!
He's just... Just pop that lid.
I'll take that, Willy.
Bob, escort Mr. Brayker, or whatever his name is, out to the car.
Sheriff, I am much obliged for your assistance in apprehending...
Don't bother. You're coming with us.
See, both those cars were stolen.
We're going down to the station and we're going to sort this shit out.
- Sheriff, you're making a big mistake.
- It won't be for the first time.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
The man said, if you knew who I was...
We'll find out soon enough.
Why wait?
Give me the keys!
Give me the goddamn keys!
Ah, come on! Get off me!
- Shit!
- Get him off!
Heads up!
Humans! You're not worth the flesh you're printed on!
Fuck this cowboy shit!
You fuckin', hodunk Podunk, well, then, motherfuckers!
All you had to do was give me the goddamn key!
Then we could get on with our lives.
All right, this property... is hereby... condemned!
Shit!
What is that?
- Oh, my God!
- Shit!
Jesus!
Oh, great.
- What the hell happened with the lights?
- It's just what we need.
They're gone.
Everybody, back!
Where do you suppose they went?
What's that smell?
Let's get out of here!
There's more of them!
Yeah, shoot 'em.
Go out the back door. Come on.
- Hurry up. Hurry up.
- Man, talk about ugly.
- Oh, that is disgusting.
- What the hell is that shit?
Shit...
- I don't see them. Do you see them?
- No.
Where the fuck did they go?
Cordelia, stay away from the door!
You see what I mean?
We can make it to my truck.
- No, I don't think so.
- Listen!
You can stay here and die if you want to.
I sure as shit ain't.
- Roach, be smart for once.
- Cordelia!
- Roach, wait.
- Just come on, would ya?
- Fuck me...!
- Cordelia, I'm coming!
I'm sorry.
Give me that gun!
Hey, fuck-face!
The eyes! Get the eyes!
On, Wally. Wally.
Oh, God...
Need a hand?
Give me the key, Brayker.
For cryin' out loud!
Wally? Wally, please don't die, Wally.
Wally?
Cordelia...
Brayker, what the hell are those things?
Demons or something?
- Worse.
- Demons. Sweet. That's just fuckin' sweet!
And they want to kill us because of you?
Who's going to protect us? You?
- Deputy Bob? Or the headless horsemen?
- We'll be all right.
Just stay inside and stay together.
- We just have to make it through the night.
- And that stuff's gonna keep them out?
There are only two things we can use against them.
- The blood in this key.
- It's blood?
And anything that destroys their eyes.
Frees their tortured souls.
- Their what?
- This is crazy!
- Deal with it!
- You deal with it, man.
They got no quarrel with us.
They just want you and that thing you're carrying.
- I say we give it to them.
- I say they'll kill you anyway.
Or possess you.
Or use you to get to the rest of us.
Like it or not, we stick together.
My cat's outside. I gotta get my cat.
You go out, you stay out.
Is that so? What are you gonna do?
Shoot us?
Right in the eyes.
Stay down here.
I'm going to seal the upstairs.
- Damn it!
- What are you doing up here?
I thought I told you to stay downstairs.
Damn!
I thought you might need help.
Look, I'm... I'm sorry about your cat.
And before, with the knife,
I wasn't gonna hurt you.
Funny thing is that I knew you weren't.
I just had a feeling about you.
Can I ask you something?
Who are you really?
I'm just an old man... running out of time.
Well, well, well. Isn't this sweet?
Soiled dove and her square-jawed postal clerk.
- You're a bastard.
- I ain't the one who tried to kill you.
Shithead, you left me out there.
Who in the hell told you to follow me?
You're absolutely right. Nobody.
Now I know who my friends are.
Whores ain't got no friends.
That's all the doors and window sealed.
- Any other ways in or out of this place?
- Aside from doors and windows?
Got some place you want us to put him?
Jeryline, let's go make some coffee.
Looks like we're in for a long night.
- Where did you get that from?
- It was my husband's.
Cleo! Hi, baby.
- You let the cat in.
- She just appeared.
- Brayker, what are you doing?
- Come on...
Animals aren't immune.
They can be possessed.
Give me the cat! Give me the cat! Shit!
- What the hell's going on?
- The cat. The cat.
Brayker, my cat is not possessed by some demon from hell.
We'll see. Listen.
- What?
- I got to talk to you.
- I got nothing to say.
- I just gotta talk to you for a second.
No, not for a second or a minute.
- Why don't you bother somebody else?
- Just for a second.
You want to talk? Let's talk about how you abandoned Cordelia.
How you left her to die. Huh?
- I hope you're ashamed of yourself, Roach.
- Not particularly, no.
Everybody's got to look out their selves.
I'm for getting out of here.
No one's going anywhere till Mr. Brayker says so.
Hey, fuck him! This is his fight.
You may want to die in this motel, but I don't.
I want to get that key, and I want to give it to those things out there.
Hey, Roach.
Haven't you caused enough trouble?
Excuse me. I'm trying to have a conversation with my friend, Wally.
He's not your friend.
Assholes don't have friends.
Excuse us. Can I talk to you for a second, please?
Jesus, Roach!
So... you got yourself a new boyfriend.
You get in my way and I'll kill you.
Keep it in your pants for a change.
I'm warning you, bitch.
- I'm not afraid of you.
- No?
No...
You better be afraid of me.
Come here, girl. Come on.
Cleo? Cleo, come on.
Cleo? Come to mommy.
Come on. Come here, girl.
Come here, Cleo. Come on.
I got you, girl. Come on, Brayker.
- See, I told you.
- Hey, look... where she came from.
Breeze.
Poor Cordelia.
Seems downright criminal to treat a pretty girl that way.
Did I say pretty? I meant beautiful.
'Cause you are.
You are beautiful, Cordelia.
Inside and out.
Maybe nobody here can see it, but I sure can.
I understand you.
I know what you want.
I know what you need.
Guys like Roach, they think... just because they're paying for it that they can treat you like shit.
If they spend the same money on dinner and a movie... they can call you "girlfriend" instead of "whore".
Whore, what a horrible word that is... to use on someone who's really just a sad girl... who's looking for love.
Tender, warm, unconditional love.
I can give you that love, as much as you can take.
All you have to do is let me in.
Let me in.
Let me in.
Let me in.
Let me in.
Cordelia?
Cordelia?
Cordelia? You okay?
- Hello, Wally.
- Hello, Cordelia.
I realized something awful about myself tonight, Wally.
My whole life, I've avoided the guys who really loved me.
Like you.
You really love me, don't you, Wally?
Yes, Cordelia, I really love you.
I've always loved you.
From the very first time
I delivered your mail.
Well, don't just do it with your eyes, Wally.
- It's some kind of tunnel.
- It's a mine shaft.
Not surprising.
The whole area's riddled with them.
This means this is a way out, right?
We can get to town before those things find out we're gone.
No.
- No, it's too risky.
- What?
Now, listen.
What the hell are you saying?
Trust me. You're safer in this house.
Oh, shit!
What was that?
- What's going on?
- Oh, God!
- Oh, God...
- What's in there?
Cordelia?
- Shit!
- Oh, man!
- Shoot it, damn it!
- I can't! I can't!
Fuck that! Shoot 'em both!
Get it! Get it!
Irene!
Go ahead.
Give it to me! Give it to me!
- Shit! It's still bleeding.
- Here.
We've got to get her outta here.
She'll bleed to death.
I'm with Jeryline. We've got to take our chances in the mines.
You know, if my memory's right... the spur that runs under here comes to a head in a mile.
- I say we do it.
- Fuck, yeah.
Nobody's going anywhere.
What makes you think they haven't found the mines?
Is it just me, or has everybody fuckin' had it with you tellin' us what to do?
If we want to go out to the mines, we're going out that way.
We don't need your fuckin' permission.
I got an idea that's gonna save us that walk.
We give those damn demons what they want.
Mr. Roach...
I'm not gonna give you the key.
You're gonna have to take it.
Then I'm gonna have to kill you, right?
Right?
- If you say so.
- I say so.
Now listen to me, all of you.
You don't know what you're up against.
Go down there, I can't help you.
You've been doing a real fine job of helping us so far...
Last I looked, we were missing
Wally and Cordelia... and half her arm.
So fuck you! I'm going.
Let's go.
Hey, Brayker.
Don't worry. I'll save you.
No!
No...
Hey, handsome, age before beauty.
Yeah, and pearl before swine, shithead.
Oh... Jeez...
You know something, Willy?
You're so dried up, the demons will probably throw you back.
Well, the sons of bitches ain't gonna get us.
I know these mines.
Used to own the damn place.
I'm gonna find that north spur and get us the hell out of here.
Shit, now...
Irene?
Irene?
You sure this is the way out, old man?
No doubt about it.
This here's the north spur.
Course, if we're heading west... then the other one is north.
Why don't we just sit down here and wait for them?
- That way!
- Let's do it.
Yeah, this is it.
The north spur's just ahead.
I don't know how anybody ever worked down here.
- Smells like a big ol' pile of do-do.
- Mommy...
It's the bat shit. You get used to it.
I remember the first time we struck pay dirt down here.
The vein was as big as your goddamn arm.
Mommy.
Mommy.
Hello?
Danny, is that you?
Danny, how the hell did you get down here?
Come on. Come on, Danny.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I promise. Come on. Come on.
You all right?
- Mom?
- Shit!
They're here! The demons are here! Run!
Let's go! Let's go! Move, move, move!
Come on! Come on!
- Go ahead! Go ahead!
- Come on! Come on!
Let's go!
Thanks, Chief. Don't worry.
They can't get past the seal.
Homer, this is for four years of minimum wage, you asshole.
- No!
- Don't shoot!
You broke the seal. Run!
Danny, go upstairs! Come on. Move it!
You got an "I told you so" coming to you.
Next time.
At least we're all in one piece.
- Sorry about that, Irene.
- It's okay. Vodka's kicking in.
- So what's the boy's name?
- Danny.
Hey, Danny. How you doing?
Listen, what were you doing down in the mines?
- Well, the man, he came back.
- Yeah.
He got my parents.
I ran away.
Brayker!
It's all right. I just have to check.
It's good to see you again, Danny.
Hey, Bob. How we fixed for ammo?
Oh, not too good.
Yeah, I'm down to four.
- How 'bout shotgun shells?
- Not up here.
Oh, man, this is hopeless.
Fuckin' hopeless.
Sons of bitches!
They drew us into a goddamn ambush!
What are you doing?
- We gotta get outta here.
- The real battle is ahead.
Sir, I don't understand.
Now take it.
No...
You're the one, Brayker.
You're the one.
Hey.
You got us into this mess.
What are you gonna do to get us out?
We just have to survive the night.
- That's all I can tell you.
- That's bullshit.
Roach is right.
We're entitled to know what's going on.
When I came here tonight,
I thought you'd be safe.
There are only five of you.
They need seven.
And then he came with Bob and the sheriff.
It's like tumblers in a lock.
Everything has to line up.
- Seven stars, seven people...
- Yeah, yeah...
Goddamn it,
I'm not making these rules up!
And I didn't... I didn't ask for this!
All right?
You wanna know what's going on?
Shall I tell ya?
In the beginning...
God created the heavens and the earth.
You're talking Genesis. That beginning?
And the earth was a formless void, and darkness covered the face of the deep.
But the darkness wasn't empty.
It was full of creatures.
Full of demons.
And they had seven keys formed into a circle... to focus the power of the cosmos into their hands... until God stepped forth and said...
"Let there be light."
And there was light.
And He scattered the demons... and He scattered the keys... all across the universe.
Then we fast-forward about two or three million millennia.
Now the demons are back.
They got six of the keys.
And one day they find the seventh key here on earth.
To save it, God filled it with the blood of a carpenter... who was being crucified by the Romans, and gave it to a thief named Sirach.
The blood ins... inside... is that...
Some of it. Yeah.
It gets used, you see.
Sirach had to refill it.
Bad neck wound.
Talon caught the artery here.
Most of what's in here now belonged to a soldier... named Dickerson. Gave it to me in France. August 23, 1917.
Funny how you remember the big dates.
Jesus, that... would make you, uh...
What happens when you run out of blood?
- They bring back the darkness.
- Just like that?
Just like that.
So... now you know.
You feel better?
God, I wish I had that bottle of vodka now.
I guess I owe you an apology, Brayker.
You really got some balls, man.
You're a fucking hero.
Where's Danny?
What?
Find him. Find him now.
- I'm gonna check in my room.
- I'll look in my room.
- Danny!
- I'll stay here.
Danny?
Danny? You in there?
Danny?
Do me a favor. Don't scream.
Just hear what I've gotta say.
And then scream.
You're so young.
You've got so much to live for.
And where the hell are you?
You're stuck in this house.
You're stuck in this town.
There's a great big world out there, Jeryline.
You should travel. You can see it all.
I can help you.
You want Paris, Rome, Athens?
You got it.
Course, if you don't help me, that's a whole other picture.
Come on, let's be real. Brayker isn't gonna get you out of here, okay?
Brayker can't even get himself out.
Little secret: The man's dead meat.
And if you stick with him, you're gonna end up the same way.
Check this out.
I hate to even think about it.
It's a simple deal, Jeryline:
You let me in, I let you out.
Horrible, isn't it?
You know, it doesn't have to be unpleasant.
Hell, I'd rather it wasn't.
All right, I know what you're thinking.
You give up your soul, you turn into a demon, you look like shit.
Where's the payoff, right?
I'll make you a little promise.
Just give me what I want, and nothing will happen to you.
Has anyone ever told you how pretty you are?
I know that sounds like a line.
Lord knows I've used it.
But I mean it.
You know, I can see to it that you stay pretty.
Forever. Think about that.
All you have to do is say yes.
Do we have a deal?
Something tells me you don't trust me.
That's all right. We'll work on that.
You will give me what I want.
That's just the way it is.
And the sooner you figure that out, the better.
- Any sign of him?
- Haven't seen him.
This doesn't make sense. Anything?
- Where's Uncle Willy?
- I haven't seen his wrinkled butt neither.
Come on, Bob.
Willy, you son of a bitch!
Hey, I found the kid.
I bet he found you. Probably wanted to know what the smell was.
I forgot all about this place.
Willy, you get downstairs now.
You take the kid with you.
Tell Brayker to get his ass and the key up here now!
Let's go.
Go on! Go on!
Okay. Okay.
Leave the bottle.
Party poopin' old bitch. Damn shit...
Hey...
They hate that.
Brayker! You in here?
Holy shit!
- Hi, Uncle Willy.
- Poor Uncle Willy!
You look like you've had a long, hard day, uncle Willy!
Oh, goodness!
I bet you could use a long, hard one.
- I know I could.
- Here you go, Uncle Willy.
Oh, yeah.
- Try mine.
- Oh, Jesus!
Oh, my goodness! Oh, my God!
Uncle Willy, are you okay?
- Try mine.
- Try mine.
Suck this one down, Uncle Willy.
Long hard one.
Nothing gets you fucked up faster.
Am I right, girls? Am I right?
Here's lookin' at you, Uncle Willy.
There you go. There you go.
Have another.
Knock yourself out.
Come on. Drink more.
Jesus Christ!
Those post office folks were right.
Son of a bitch!
This guy was reading all our mail.
What the hell...?
Shit! Wally was crazier than I thought.
Give me your light, Bob.
Oh, God!
He was planning to take out the post office for Cordelia.
Well, if he was... he didn't have any bullets to do it.
Then again...
Willy?
Danny?
- No! Stop it!
- Oh! Yeah!
We got a whole lot of trouble!
- Jeryline! Help!
- Let go!
- Jeryline! Jeryline, help me!
- You will give me what I want.
Hello! I'm your waiter, Skip.
Our special today is poached appendage.
Market price, of course.
I recommend the finger food.
Want your arm back, Irene?
I can make it happen.
- Is that a yes?
- No.
That's me giving you the finger, asshole.
I'll get back to you.
Willy, don't make me do this.
- Uncle Willy.
- Stop!
- Please stop, mister!
- Uncle Willy, Please don't make me do this.
Put him down!
Hello?
Hello?
- Mr. Roach! What have you got there?
- I want out of here...
- and I'm lookin' to cut a deal.
- Well, let's talk about it.
Put him down!
Jeryline.
You wouldn't hurt your old Uncle Willy now, would you, baby?
Jesus! Oh, man!
Shit!
- Get the eyes!
- I heard that.
Get the eyes!
Get away!
Oh, boy!
- How do I know you ain't gonna kill me?
- You have my word.
Frankly, we've been counting on you, haven't we?
The world needs more people like you, Mr. Roach.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
You don't mind if we kill the others?
Hey, if it makes you feel good, do it.
"If it makes you feel good, do it."
Exactly.
First things first, of course.
The blood seal.
Listen, on a personal note.
Be sure and kill Brayker.
- He's a bossy asshole.
- Isn't he, though?
- Thank you.
- That's it?
- Oh, that's it.
- You ain't such a bad fellow.
You aren't so bad yourself.
Oh, a pleasure doing business with you, Mr. Roach.
Well... you know this...
"hell on earth" business?
Big fucking deal! I got hemorrhoids.
Vaya con Dios.
And a "vaya con diablos" to you too, sir.
Oh, Roach. There's just one more thing
I forgot to mention:
I lied.
Anybody home? Come on out, everybody?
It's time to play! Hello?
Or not.
Come on, Brayker, move your ass.
Grab the case and get over here.
Let's go.
Cleo! Come on, baby.
Yeah...
Go.
I want you all up in the steeple now!
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna cover the rear.
Get your asses up there! Go!
Up. Up, up, up!
This is my house, and I make the rules!
Now get up there!
Shit!
Supper time.
Only enough for one entrance.
Is that all there is?
That's all.
The window.
What did you do that for?
- Take it.
- What?
Out of the seven, you're the only one left.
You're the chosen one.
That's what I came here to do.
Give you this key.
Can I have it?
Danny?
Danny, no!
Danny!
Stop it! Let him go right now!
No!
Danny, no!
Shit! Oh, Jesus!
- Brayker, I'm so sorry.
- Don't be.
You killed him, right?
That's all that's important.
- You're ready.
- Ready for what?
For the key. Give me the key.
Brayker, I can't do this.
I'm not the right person for this shit!
He tried to seduce you, didn't he?
- He tried.
- You're exactly the right kind of person.
Give me your hand.
- I can't, Brayker.
- He's still down there. Come on!
When the stars line up, you'll know what to do.
I can't tell you how long.
Maybe a lifetime.
Maybe several.
And on that day, you'll fight.
And when that night is over, you'll do what I just did.
Watch your back, Jeryline.
Watch your...
Brayker?
Don't you leave me!
Brayker! Wake up!
Come on. Wake up.
See that, Jeryline?
I was right about Brayker.
He's dead.
You, you're still here, aren't you?
I'm not gonna hurt you unless you make me.
You just stay where you are.
Personally, I was hoping we could avoid this.
Just pour the blood out.
Save yourself the years of running.
I mean, really, what's the point?
It all ends up the same way.
Look at you.
You must be in exquisite pain.
All covered with blood.
That's right.
It's not my blood.
Bitch!
It's curtains for you, baby. Come on!
I'm sure you're familiar with the relationship...
- between cleanliness and godliness.
- No! No!
Well, let me tell you something.
That's the first thing
I'm gonna change.
You wash and you wash behind the ear.
You rinse and you rinse, and it comes out clear.
No, you don't!
How was that? Good.
I liked those too. Damn!
Brayker didn't have time to tell you everything.
That eyeball shit only works on low-level demons.
I know. Who makes up all these rules?
Upsy-daisy!
This is a special day for me, Jeryline.
I waited a long time for this promotion, and I have to tell you...
You know, I'm glad that it's you who could share it with me.
Don't feel bad about giving up the key because... by the time your race finds out what happened... well, they'll look like last week's leftovers anyway.
So... cheer up.
Thanks.
I warned you.
I told you what would happen.
You didn't believe me.
I forgive you.
I know what you're thinking:
"He's got the key. What else could he possibly want now?"
I want you. You know... no one's ever brought a demon knight over to the other side before.
Well, not in one piece, anyway.
Honey, you'd be the first.
There'd be a period of adjustment, of course.
I'm very easy to live with,
I'm clean, I don't drink... much.
And I know my folks are gonna love you.
I notice you're not saying anything...
Is that because you're thinking of something?
What is there to think about?
There was a time when a coy silence was appreciated in a woman.
Well, this is not one of those times!
And you're really starting to piss me off!
Down, boy!
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to get angry. I...
Jeryline. Jeryline...
I'm gonna say something to you...
I haven't said to anyone.
Jeryline, I lo... you.
Jeryline, I lo... you.
Jeryline, do you think you could ever find it in your heart... to possibly lo... me?
Didn't think so.
All right, let's...
Fuck it.
You will die.
But at least we'll be together forever.
If I can't have your soul,
I'm gonna take your heart.
Thank you.
Big luggage to the back, please.
- Thank you.
- Hold on.
No.
It's okay.
I'll wait for the next one.
Ah, I love "scarnations."
You'll be happy to know, kiddies..
That Jeryline lived happily ever after.
In fact, I even got a "ghostcard" from her.
She's traveling the world and having a fabulous time.
As for me, I'm afraid
I've got to hurry.
Tonight's our big "screamiere".
Hello.
Hello, hello.
Ah, the whole fan club is here.
Hello, baby-booby-bubby.
Uh-oh! I think my producers are trying to tell me something.
Well, what do you know!
I asked for final cut, and I got it.
Now that's "inter-tainment"!
Oh, still here, creeps?
What's the matter?
Didn't get your minimum deadly allowance of murder, madness and mayhem?
Then look out for my next motion picture.
"Dead Easy", coming very soon to a theater near you.
Give me a hand over here!
Right.
I'll be over there. I can't deal with it now.
Right! Load it up in the back!
Hello, Doris.
Wanna do me a favour?
Help me load the next order.
You are no lady, Doris.
Far from it.
Good morning, boys and girls!
Did we all remember to bring our homework today?
We didn't?
We know what happens to little boys and girls who don't do their homework.
Okay, class is over.
Do you hear me? Class is over!
Okay, I'm just gonna have to make another example.
Surprise!
I know you're there, Warwick.
You know something?
You just saved me a trip to your office.
I may be desperate for work, but not desperate enough to....
Everything's set down here!
Okay, let her rip.
God damn!
Adiós, motherfuckers!
Excuse us, please.
Thanks.
Wouldn't mind having his boots resting under my bed.
One more pair of boots, you'll have to open a boot shop.
Anyway, he's married.
Daisy May, more coffee.
Daisy May, let's make us a baby doggie-style.
They found him in pieces.
The rats were all over him.
It was really unbelievable.
What have you got in the bag, pal?
Not very friendly, is he?
I bet his mummy packs his lunch.
Peanut butter and jelly.
Without the crust.
Looks like a boy scout to me.
Maybe a girl scout.
See you around, girl scout!
You ought to see who they're hiring.
She's one cute little chick.
The accidental death at Bachman Textile has opened the restored mill...
to a series of investigations and probable lawsuits.
Jason Reed was working the night shift when the mysterious accidents occurred.
- Good morning, Mr. Warwick!
- Hello.
God, this is bad!
Extreme safety hazard.
Exterminator's working round the clock.
He's tired.
- Needs more time.
- There's already been one accident.
This place must be cleared before another worker steps foot in this death trap.
Damn!
July fourth holiday.
I'll organise a cleanup.
I'll hold on to this till then.
I'll be back.
To be honest, I don't think you'll find a crew that would work here.
Not down here.
We'll see.
Come shower with me. We can save water.
Get a load of the new guy.
Better get up!
This will work out just fine.
- See you later.
- 'Bye.
'Morning.
Good morning.
Do you take coffee, Mr....
Hall. No, thanks. I'll pass today.
Me, too.
Can't be more than an instant enema by now.
You here by car or by thumb?
By Greyhound.
I see you got a real problem staying put.
Lots of movement over the past five years.
Starts down in Florida, comes all the way up the map.
Are you on the run, friend?
I'm here for a fresh start.
College boy.
No, that's not the problem.
With all due respect, what is?
Fair enough.
Putting it plainly, Mr. Hall, you're a drifter.
I get no guarantees with a drifter.
You get no guarantees with any man.
There's only instinct.
You spent some time at Munson Textile.
You ever run the picker?
I know how.
Then you also know it's a one-man operation.
This mill depends on that machine.
And what's left of Gates Falls depends on this mill.
We don't do better than minimum to start.
Four weeks before the union comes knocking at your door.
Are you still interested?
- Sounds fair to start.
- All right, then.
That's it, except for the hours.
Because of the heat, we only run that sucker through the night.
The graveyard shift.
Spread the word, fucker.
Mice.
Damn! That's good shooting.
Tucker Cleveland, Martial Extermination.
John Hall.
Looks like one of your buddies got a little too close to the blower.
I'd love to know how many of them beantown executives... are wearing one of your rat-lined overcoats.
No, thanks. Gave that up with the wife.
I should miss her as much.
- You work late hours.
- I have no choice.
The Yellow Pages are thick with competitors.
I don't mind telling you... this place is infested.
That may be the understatement of the year.
The schmuck you work for don't wanna hear that.
Afraid of what it's gonna cost the mill.
He thinks a little tracking poison will do the trick.
I've been dealing with these things for more than 20 years... and we ain't talking about no candy-ass field mice.
These sons of bitches piss on tracking poison... piss on it to warn their little fucker friends.
Take it from me.
There's only one way to deal with their kind.
On their own terms.
I first met up with them back in Con Tien.
Big as puppies, and they had no fear.
Not of death, nothing, like the Cong.
And I ain't one of them burning-baby, flashback fuck-ups... you see Bruce Dern playing, so quit your grinning.
Anyways....
Conditions being what they were back then, we had little choice.
We shared the land... we shared our food with the fuckers... and they turn around, stabbing us in the back... by going to work for the VC.
That's right.
Because the VC would reward them with a hot meal.
Do you have any idea what a VC rat eats?
Try raw, American...
"Hold the mayo, thank you."
The Cong... had a way of serving up a meal... real nice and fancy.
They would stake one of our boys to the ground... through his hands, through his feet... and stake him like Jesus.
And then... they would make a cut just above the abdomen.
Now, this wasn't a fatal cut.
This was merely an entry wound.
Then, they'd get a rat... a real hungry rat.
One they hadn't been feeding for about a week.
And they'd put it on the wound... and they'd stick its nose down inside.
And if the damned thing wasn't starving enough... they'd cover it with a flaming rice bowl.
And let me tell you... that grey-black son of a bitch... would have nowhere else to go but inside.
He'd start clawing his way through... looking to put an end to that loud beating sound.
Like a human artichoke.
So warm, so juicy.
Maybe I'm a little prejudiced.
Anybody call a break?
No laughing on company hours.
Looks like you just bought yourself a shift... scrubbing the latrines.
I should be downstairs humiliating the college boy by now.
Bravo, Ippeston!
Now we can get you that audition on Star Search.
Come here, boy.
We got commitments to our
New York sales office due on Wednesday.
Are we on schedule?
- Yes, Mr. Warwick.
- Fetch me the work order, boy.
- 'Evening.
- 'Evening.
How are you tonight?
We're on time.
In fact, we're slightly ahead.
I'm asking about you, Jane.
How are you?
I'm managing, thanks.
You look tired.
Like you're losing too much of your beauty sleep or something.
The night shift will do that to a girl.
I try to do my job.
Do you have a problem with that?
Who said anything about a deal?
I'm talking about a promotion.
A cool office, a desk!
This cleanup ain't gonna be pretty, darling.
I got Stevenson down there now, stringing the lights.
He's pissing and moaning about the heat.
- And it's gonna get hotter.
- I can handle it.
It's double pay, so back off, man.
- Why don't you wisen up?
- Like Nardello?
I'm gonna see you down in the basement.
There ain't no way they'll get this place settled in a week.
Goddamn rats!
This is a whole bunch of bullshit.
Brogan?
Is that you?
Shit.
Very funny! I'm laughing my ass off.
How about picking up a....
Oh, damn.
- So what about Stevenson?
- He left in the middle of the job... and didn't pick up his pay.
Lookee who's here.
Still alive.
- How you doing? Want some coffee?
- Please, coffee and toast.
We got you a little something to nibble on.
Enjoy.
Special order for the Commander of the Rat Patrol.
Bastards.
Do you need a lift?
Hi, sweetheart.
Don't wanna be doing that in broad daylight.
Then let's do it in the dark.
Mr. Warwick?
Who wants to know?
Tony Carmichael.
I hear you're looking for a few good men.
Come this way.
I'll talk to you later about that there thing.
Nice meeting you, ma'am.
Those guys are assholes.
Every town has them.
That's a depressing thought.
- Which town are you from?
- Wheeling.
West Virginia? That's nice.
How about you?
You lived here your whole life?
No way. I'm from Castle Rock.
Castle Rock. Sounds very Norman Rockwell.
No, it's just Castle Rock.
I'll see you around.
You're on the basement cleanup crew, no doubt.
- Not that I know of.
- You will be.
I know Warwick, and you're a prime candidate.
I bet your wife ain't too thrilled.
Losing you through the night, and all.
We gotta do what we gotta do, right?
My wife's dead.
I'm sorry.
Thank you for the ride.
Take care.
Keep the lights as high up to the ceiling as possible.
We'll get a water vac in here tomorrow.
Mop this shit up.
Welcome aboard.
You're jumpy, aren't you, kid?
Not to worry. The rats don't bite.
What happened to the fellow who started this job?
What happened?
He didn't work out.
He needs this typed right away.
- What is it?
- Cleanup crew.
Looks like you made the list, Nardello.
Basement cleanup!
Clean up this, Warwick!
- What the fuck is she doing?
- Where's Warwick?
He's right there.
He's gonna be wicked pissed.
How can you do this to me?
You like it rough, don't you, Nardello?
You can't put me down there.
You can't put anybody down there!
I know things.
What are you talking about?
You better watch what you're saying.
I don't think so.
I think from now on you better watch what you're saying.
Come on. I'll take you home.
All right.
The show's over.
Everybody go back to doing what you were doing.
I'm sorry. I thought you were a rat.
You're not the first.
I wanted to drop in and thank you.
Sorry about that situation with Nardello.
Tempers flared.
It was a big misunderstanding.
You know how it is.
Anyway....
As a show of gratitude...
I want to offer you the chance to earn some extra cash.
Next week is the July fourth holiday.
The mill is shut down.
That means vacation week for most of our people... those with the union.
Layoff week for the rest.
But there is work available for a select few.
We got that cleanup thing going on down in the basement.
Regular graveyard shift hours, and I'm handpicking the crew.
To tell you the truth...
I've watched you work... and I like your style.
Gonna be a mess, no doubt about it.
That bastard ain't been touched since Christ was a kid.
But it's for double pay.
Now you tell me if an educated guy like you... can't use double pay.
- Thank you, Mr. Warwick.
- You are so welcome, Mr. Hall.
Hey, Commander.
Hey, rat man.
You must feel awful special.
You're gonna be down in the shit pit with the rest of us.
I bet he likes your style.
Wait a minute, he said he liked my style!
What's going on?
Guess who finally made
Warwick's cleanup crew?
Congratulations.
Do you want to get out of here?
Yeah.
Thanks.
- You were hungry.
- Yeah, for decent food.
It's been a while.
I worked a spell as a short order cook in Miami.
Mostly burgers.
I want to hear the rest of your story.
You got married and left Castle Rock against your father's advice.
Why are dads always right?
I don't know.
Anyway....
It wasn't too long after my divorce...
Warwick came sniffing around.
He said he wanted to help. He felt bad.
So he offered me a promotion to office manager... to ease my emotional as well as financial burdens.
All I'd have to do in return... was perform a couple of days a week on the couch in his office.
He even had them picked out.
Monday and Wednesday.
- Son of a bitch.
- Should've brought him up on charges.
I tried, and was advised by Personnel to see a therapist.
They couldn't get rid of me.
I was saved by the union and the fact
Warwick would look like the shit he is.
So I'm still here.
On borrowed time, I guess.
I bet you hate him, too, Mrs. Warwick.
This will teach you to fire me, you son of a bitch.
Shit.
Pull.
Do you want to try it?
Leave the ghetto blaster back in the ghetto.
Yes, sir.
Don't want anybody being cute with one of these.
You'll end up spraying one of your buddies back onto a slab.
Work areas are listed over there just like we talked about.
Jobs are split evenly night by night.
Tried to keep it interesting.
Any questions?
Basically... we need to have this basement in a workable state by next Thursday.
We only have the chain hoist for one night.
Execute these orders, you'll get through it without a snag.
And then what happens?
Do we get a gold watch or something?
Sure beats nailing them with soda pop.
What are you doing?
Warwick said to list everything.
Fifty-year-old files are crap.
List them as fifty-year-old crap.
It's not salvageable.
Hey, check this out.
Come on, take a break.
The longer it takes, the longer we'll be down here doing it.
This thing's in great shape.
Rats.
No problem.
Where are you going, asshole?
You goddamn ignoramus, you almost killed me!
What the hell is your problem, Brogan?
I ain't got a problem.
You got a problem?
Look, guys, this is crazy.
We were hired as a cleanup crew, not as exterminators.
I need this money as bad as the next guy, but we are not damn exterminators!
What's your problem, boy?
- We were hired to clean the basement up.
- "We"?
Are you speaking for everybody?
Or just yourself?
Just me, Mr. Warwick.
"Just me, Mr. Warwick."
You'd best be punching out your time card.
Permanently.
Is that clear, boy?
Did somebody call a break?
Control that sack of fleas, Cleveland.
Please.
Moxy, come on over here.
Moxy here is a real special breed.
A rat terrier.
He didn't waste his puppy years down at the beach... playing Frisbee with Frankie and Annette.
He was too busy training.
Tracking rats through walls, through concrete.
Looks to me like he doesn't always win.
Moxy, cut that out!
We've got ourselves a little problem, you and me.
Our sister mills along the river don't take too kindly... to having their backyards polluted by rat stew.
Our own Mr. Bachman has graciously agreed... to keep your name out of any impending lawsuit.
You are legally responsible... when it comes right down to it.
Ain't you a kick in the nuts.
First off...
I was called personally by Bachman... and told to pump directly into the river because... just between you, me, and Moxy... he was too cheap to spring for the dumping charges himself.
I hope you got that in writing.
- Fuck you!
- No, fuck you.
This kind of thing can cost you your exterminator's license.
But again... no one's naming names.
We're only asking you to provide one additional service.
I got an idea where them things are nesting.
It shouldn't take you more than a night.
What is it you got me doing?
When was the last time you been to a graveyard?
Come on, Moxy!
The sooner we find their little home... the sooner we can get back to ours.
Go on, Moxy, get them.
Eat them for breakfast!
Come on, Moxy.
There just ain't no job worth this.
Ain't no dog worth it, either.
- Just a few more hours.
- I know.
The break's over.
Back to work!
- It's almost over.
- I thought it would never end.
Place still looks like shit.
What do they want to put down here?
- A nightclub.
- Really?
You must've been at the top of your class, Brogan.
Truth is, they're expanding for offices.
Who would have an office down here?
- Hey!
- What?
Look at this.
What you got, kids?
A trapdoor.
Ain't that interesting?
It certainly is.
That's where your rats are coming from.
They're breeding underground.
You know it all, don't you?
Hey, boys... come on over here!
- I can't get at it.
- Brogan, give me a hand!
I wonder what's down there.
Fetch a lamp.
You're not thinking of going down?
Me? No, sir.
Johnny's on hoses tonight.
I trust his judgment, him being a college boy and all.
On one condition.
I'll need an extra body to help me carry the line.
Name your body.
You, Mr. Foreman.
The management should be represented in this little adventure.
Don't you think?
In case there is buried treasure,
I don't want to be accused of stealing.
You first.
I'll be right after you.
I'm going.
Danson, Carmichael, come on, get up!
Brogan, you too!
At Bachman we're just one big happy family.
Yeah, the Manson Family.
You all right?
Let's go over there to set you down.
Come on.
Brogan, watch your step.
What the hell have we got here?
A bygone power source. Water power.
Looks like it hasn't worked in years.
Smells like stale piss down here.
I say we turn around right now.
So much for your breeding ground, Hall.
- Does it hurt?
- Yeah.
Brogan, you're a regular bug light.
I see him!
Grab hold of the wood!
I'm coming down!
There's something down here!
Hold on!
Oh, Jesus.
- There he is!
- Please help me!
Come on.
He's dead. Brogan's dead!
Shut up, Carmichael!
Give me that.
We can use these for weapons.
Something our friend Hall hasn't got.
I'll deal with her and Hall.
Fuck Hall. Forget about Hall.
Start thinking about whatever the hell is down here.
He found the opening.
He brought us down here.
We wouldn't be here if it weren't for him.
So don't go telling me my business.
You're going out of your mind, Warwick.
You just stood there and watched Brogan die.
You didn't.
Move.
It's a dead end.
There must be some other way out of here.
Wait, listen.
Wait a second!
There's gotta be a way out.
Here. Grab ahold of this.
Which way do we go?
What do you have there?
Water. Pretty loud.
Do you hear it?
Sounds like the river.
I knew this was a way out.
It's your moment, Carmichael. You go first.
Go on. We'll be right in back of you.
There's a hole here.
I think we can break through.
It's wet.
Something's got my arm!
Help me!
What is it?
Help me! Something's got my arm!
Danson, move!
Please, somebody help me!
Move!
It's blocked!
Wait!
The river!
Help me!
Help me!
All right, now.
We're gonna take this nice and slow.
No more! No more!
I'm not going! I'm not going anymore!
Do you want to die?
I'm not going anywhere!
It ain't that bad.
It's ice cold.
I'm very close.
We'll never get through that way.
At least not with that thing.
Help me!
We're going to make it.
I know.
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.
This must be where it lives.
Come on, let's go.
Mr. Foreman.
Come on, let's lift him up.
- It's really bad.
- We should let the bastard bleed.
Hold this for a second.
Here!
We are going to hell.
Together!
There's only one way to deal with these fuckers.
The year, 1462.
Constantinople had fallen.
Moslem Turks swept into Europe, threatening all of Christendom.
From Transylvania arose a Romanian knight.
Dracula.
On the eve of the battle, his bride, Elizabetha, knew that he must face an insurmountable force from which he might never return.
Elizabetha...
The vengeful Turks shot a message into the castle.
It told of Dracula’s death.
Elizabetha, believing him dead, flung herself into the river.
My prince is dead.
All is lost without him.
May God unite us in heaven.
I've done everything you asked, Master.
All the preparations are in order.
Everything.
I await your command, for I know that when the rewards are given,
I will be one of those who benefits from your generosity.
Thank you.
Renfield is deranged.
He's lost his mind, poor chap.
Take over his foreign client, this eccentric Count Dracula.
He's buying up property in London.
Of course, sir.
Thank you for your confidence.
This is a great opportunity, Harker.
Leave for Transylvania immediately.
Opportunities such as this come but once in a lifetime.
May I enquire, what happened to Mr. Renfield in Transylvania?
Nothing... Personal problems.
Close these transactions, and your future with this firm is assured.
Yes, sir.
I will give it my full attention.
We've waited this long...
- We can be married when I return.
- Of course.
- I will write.
- Jonathan...
- Jonathan, I love you.
- I love you, Mina.
25th May, Budapest.
Left Budapest early this morning.
We're leaving the West...
We're traveling to the far east of the country.
To the border of Transylvania,
Moldavia and Bukovina in the Carpathian mountains.
One of the wildest areas of Europe.
My friend, welcome to the Carpathians.
I am anxiously expecting you.
At the Borgo Pass, my carriage will await you.
I trust your journey from London has been a happy one.
And I hope you will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.
Your friend... D.
Diary, 25th May. My dear Jonathan has been gone almost a week.
I wish we'd married before his departure, but I am happy he was sent on this important mission.
It must be so nice to see strange countries.
I wonder if Jonathan and I shall ever see them together.
We're early, driver.
No one is here.
I say, is the castle far?
Welcome to my home.
Enter of your own will and leave some of the happiness you bring.
- Count Dracula?
- I am Dracula.
And I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house.
Come in.
You will, I trust, excuse me that I do not join you.
I have already dined and I never drink...
...wine.
An ancestor?
I see a resemblance.
The order of the Dracul...
...is a dragon.
An ancient society pledging my forefathers to defend the church against all enemies of Christ.
That relationship was not entirely... successful.
Oh, yes...
It is no laughing matter!
We Draculs have a right to be proud.
No devil was greater than Attila, whose blood flows in these veins.
Blood...
...is too precious a thing in these times.
The warlike days are over.
The victories of my great race are but a tale to be told.
I am the last of my kind.
I have offended you with my ignorance. Forgive me.
I long to go through the crowded streets of your mighty London.
To be in the midst of the whirl and the rush of humanity.
To share its life, its changes... its death.
There. You, Count...
... are the owner of Carfax Abbey.
Congratulations.
Your firm writes most highly of your talents.
They say you are a man of good... taste.
And that you are a worthy substitute to your predecessor, Mr. Renfield.
You may rely on me.
I'm curious. Why ten houses in such precise locations?
Is it to raise the market value?
Do you believe in destiny?
That even the powers of time can be altered for a single purpose?
The luckiest man on earth is the one who finds... true love.
You found Mina.
I thought she was lost.
We're to be married when I return.
Are you married, Count?
Sir, are you married?
I was married once.
Ages ago, it seems.
She died.
- I'm very sorry.
- She was fortunate.
My life, at its best, is misery.
She will, no doubt, make a devoted wife...
...and you a faithful husband.
Come, write to your firm and any loved ones.
Say that it should please you to stay with me for a month.
A month?
Do you wish me to stay so long?
I will take no refusal.
Diary. 30th May, 1897.
Jonathan does not want me to stay with Lucy while he is away.
If I become accustomed to the privileges of the Weston family, he thinks I will not be content as the wife of a mere clerk.
But Lucy and I are friends.
She has never minded that I am only a schoolmistress.
Disgusting!
Mina...
Mina, you're always working.
Is your ambitious John Harker forcing you to learn that machine?
He could be forcing you into acts of passion on the parlor floor.
Lucy! You shouldn't talk about my fiancé in such a way.
There's more to marriage than carnal pleasures.
So I see... much, much more!
What is it, Lucy?
I don't understand it.
Can man and woman really do... that?
- I did... only last night.
- Fibber! You did not.
Yes, I did. Well, in my dreams.
Jonathan measures up, doesn't he?
You can tell Lucy.
We've kissed, that's all.
He thinks he's too poor to marry me.
It's all the worse now that
I'm visiting you... my rich friend.
Yes, but not one marriage proposal, and here I am almost 20...
Practically a hag!
Mr. Quincy P. Morris!
Look! What is that?
A Texan. Quincy P. Morris.
He's so young and fresh.
- A wild stallion between my legs.
- You're positively indecent!
I just know what men desire.
Watch.
- Quincy, darling.
- Miss Lucy...
You're as fresh as a spring rain.
Quincy, please let me touch it.
It's so big.
My dear, sweet little girl. I hold your hand, and you've kissed me.
Jack! Oceans of love...
Oh, my poor little baby!
Come over here, my poor little blossom.
My poor, little, brilliant doctor.
- What a naughty bear.
- Arthur Holmwood, Esquire.
My darling.
I'm so sorry about your hat.
This is my snake dress.
Lucy is a pure and virtuous girl, but she does shock me sometimes.
Jonathan says a defect of the rich is that they say what they please.
But I admire Lucy and I'm not surprised men flock around her.
I wish I were as pretty and as adored as she.
You are the love of my life.
What manner of man is this?
R.N. Renfield, successful solicitor in the firm of Hawkins & Thompkins.
Member of the Wyndham Club.
He returns from business abroad in Transylvania and suffers a mental breakdown.
He's obsessed with some bloodlust.
George.
Wait here.
Would you care for an hors d'oeuvre, doctor, or a canapé?
- No, thank you. How are you?
- Better than my love-sick doctor.
- Does my private life interest you?
- Of course. All life interests me.
- Your diet is disgusting.
- They're perfectly nutritious.
Each life that I ingest gives back life to me.
- A fly gives you life?
- Certainly.
You'll eat molecules with chopsticks before I eat the lesser carnivore.
I shall have to invent a new classification of lunatic for you.
What about spiders?
Spiders eat the flies.
- Yes, spiders eat them.
- What about sparrows?
- Yes... did you say sparrows?
- Something larger perhaps?
Oh yes...
A kitten. I beg you!
A little, sleek, playful kitten.
Something I can teach.
Something I can feed.
Don't refuse me.
Wouldn't you prefer a cat?
Yes! A big cat!
My salvation depends upon it.
- Your salvation?
- Yes, lives for the Master.
Master? What master?
The Master will come.
- He's promised to make me immortal.
- How?
The blood is the life!
Blood is the life!
30th May, Castle Dracula. I think things that I dare not confess.
The way the Count looked at
Mina's picture fills me with fear.
As if I have a part to play in a story that is not known to me.
I didn't hear you come in.
Take care. You cut yourself.
It is more dangerous than you think.
A foul bauble of man's... vanity.
Perhaps you should grow a beard.
The letters I requested... have you written them?
Good.
Should you leave these rooms, you will not go to sleep in any other part of the castle.
It is old and has many bad memories.
- Be warned.
- I'm sure I understand.
Do not put your faith in such... trinkets of deceit.
We are in Transylvania, and Transylvania is not England.
Our ways are not your ways.
And to you... there shall be many strange things.
I've seen strange things already.
Wolves chasing me! A blue inferno!
Listen to them.
The children of the night.
- What sweet music they make.
- Music? Those animals?
I did as Dracula instructed.
I wrote three letters.
To the firm, to my family, and to my beloved Mina.
I said nothing of my fears, as he will read them, no doubt.
I know now that I am a prisoner.
Jonathan...
Jonathan, come to me.
Come.
Lay down.
Lay back into my arms.
Lay back, Jonathan.
What is this? Charlatans!
Dearest Mina, all is well here.
The Count has insisted that I remain here for a month.
I can say no more, except I love you. Ever faithful, Jonathan.
The letters I have written have undoubtedly sealed my doom.
The Count's gypsies, loyal to the death to whomever they serve.
Day and night, they fill boxes with earth from the castle's cellar.
They are to be delivered to Carfax Abbey in London.
Why do they fill these boxes with earth?
I love him!
Mina, it's so wonderful.
I've decided.
- I love him and I've said yes!
- Finally.
- The Texan with the big knife?
- No, to my number three.
Lord Arthur Holmwood.
You're to be my maid of honor.
Mina, what is it? It's the most exciting day of my life.
- You don't seem to care.
- I'm so worried about Jonathan.
This letter I received is so cold.
It's not like him at all.
Mina, don't worry.
Captain's log, the Demeter.
27th June, 1897.
We picked up 50 boxes of earth bound for London, England.
We set sail at noon into a storm that seemed to come from nowhere, carrying us out to sea.
3rd July. Second mate is missing.
Nearing Gibraltar.
Storm continues.
Crew uneasy.
Believes someone or something is aboard the ship with us.
He is here!
The master of all life is at hand!
Gather round! I am here to do your bidding, Master!
I have worshipped you from afar, but now you are near.
I am your slave.
I await your command.
The Renfield case grows more interesting.
There is method in his madness, with his flies and spiders.
Had I the secret of even one such brilliant mind...
Lucy...
Lucy!
No, do not see me!
Lucy...
- I couldn't control myself.
- You're dreaming. Sleepwalking.
My soul...
It seemed to leave my body.
There was this agonizing feeling.
- I started shaking.
- It's all right, you're dreaming.
It pulled me and lured me.
I had no control.
Those red eyes. I still have the taste of his blood in my mouth.
Master, I'm here to do your bidding.
'They will say that I have shed innocent blood.
'What's blood for if not for shedding?
'With my hook for a hand
'I'll split you from your groin to your gullet.
'I came for you. '
This is the scariest story
I've ever heard and it's totally true.
'It happened a few years ago near Moses lake in Indiana.
'Clara was baby-sitting for the Johnsons
'and Billy pulls up on his motorcycle.
'She wasn't even going out with Billy.
'She was going out with Michael for about six months
'but she always kind of had the hots for Billy
'because he was like a bad boy
'and Michael was... he was just so nice.
'So anyway, she decides that tonight's the night
'that she's going to give Billy what she never gave to Michael. '
Have you ever heard of Candyman?
No.
His right hand is sawn off.
He has a hook jammed in the bloody stump and if you look in the mirror and you say his name five times he'll appear behind you, breathing down your neck.
You want to try it?
'So Billy began.
'He looked in the mirror, and he said... '
Candyman...
Candyman...
Candyman...
Candyman...
No one ever got past four.
Not here.
Go downstairs.
I have a surprise for you.
'She looked in the mirror
'and I don't know why
'but she said his name the last time. '
Candyman.
'She turned out the lights... '
...and what he saw turned his hair white from shock.
Killed her.
Split her open with his hook and then killed the baby too.
And Billy got away but soon after, he went crazy.
My... my roommate's boyfriend knows him.
So when did you first hear this story?
My friend heard it on the radio.
It's true. Sick, huh?
The baby-sitter just roasted the kid like it was a turkey or something.
So, what's the deal?
You guys doing a page on serial killers?
Something like that.
Well, that's it.
We're done.
- Thanks.
- No problem.
See you.
See you.
See you.
Seems like they're getting younger every day.
Does anybody remember the craze for the pet baby alligators?
When they got too large to keep people flushed them down the toilet.
They live in the sewers.
Some or them are 30 feet long.
- Where did this happen?
- In Miami.
They went blind and albino from living in the dark.
It wasn't Miami. It was New York.
I read it in the paper.
Then it must be true.
Why would Danny and Diane both be suffering from the same delusion in two cities over 1,000 miles apart?
Let's face it, folks.
There are no alligators in the sewers.
No, it's... it's round the campfire.
It's bedtime stories.
See, these stories are... modern oral folklore.
They are the unselfconscious reflection of the fears of urban society.
That's lunch.
Like the primordial reptile it's formed into a monster. Why?
Ouch! Oh...
- The dashing professor.
- The lovely wife.
Helen, you know everybody?
Crème de la crème...
Harold, Diane, Danny, Stacey.
- Hi.
- Hello.
So, keep up the good work.
Thank you for your contributions.
- Thanks. Bye.
- Awesome lecture.
Bye.
See ya.
So, you want to tell me about this girl?
What's her name? Stacey.
She could barely look me in the eyes, Trevor and she was blushing.
Well, I guess it's because she's madly in love with me.
All those bursting adolescent hormones.
- You don't really think...
- No, of course not.
Good. I should hope not.
So, what's the matter?
Trevor, you promised you wouldn't do the urban legends lecture until next semester.
You knew Bernadette and I were gathering data.
Why did you have to ruin it?
I love you dearly but I can't hold up their education while the two of you complete your thesis.
I have a curriculum to follow here.
Yes, I know.
Well... so don't be mad at me.
'If you look in the mirror and say his name five times
'he'll appear behind you, breathing down your neck. '
Can I clean your room?
Oh, sure. Don't mind me.
'So Billy began.
'He looked in the mirror
'and he said, "Candyman,
Candyman, Candyman... "'
Candyman, huh?
Yes. Have you heard of him?
- You doing a study on him?
- Yes, I am.
What have you heard?
Everybody scared of him once it get dark.
He live over at Cabrini.
My friend told me about him.
Cabrini Green?
Yeah, in the Projects.
I live on the South Side so I don't know much about it.
But my friend know all about it.
Her cousin live at Cabrini.
They say he killed a lady.
Can I talk to your friend?
Sure.
Kitty?
- Yeah, what do you want?
- Lady down here want to talk to you.
All right.
She coming.
I'm Helen Lyle.
Pleased to meet you.
Henrietta Mosely.
And this is Kitty Culver.
Tell her what you told me about the Candyman.
All I know is there was some lady in a tub, and she heard a noise.
Do you remember her name?
Her name was Ruthie Jean.
She heard banging and smashing like somebody was making a hole in the wall.
So Ruthie called 911.
She said, "Somebody is coming through the wall. "
And they didn't believe her.
They thought the lady was crazy, right?
So she called 911 again and they still didn't believe her.
When they finally got there, she was dead.
Was she shot?
No.
She was killed with a hook. Schhht!
It's true.
Yeah, I read it in the papers.
Candyman killed her.
Yeah, but...
I don't know nothing about that.
Helen, this is sick.
This isn't one of your fairy tales.
The woman got killed here.
That's not the half of it.
That's Cabrini Green not that you'd recognise it today.
Yeah, no kidding.
I won't even drive past there.
- A kid got shot there the other day.
- Everyday.
OK, now look carefully at this picture and then this one.
You spot it?
No.
That's not Cabrini Green.
That's this building,
Lincoln village.
My apartment was built as a housing project.
No.
Yeah.
Now take a look at this.
Once finished the city realised there was no barrier between here and the Gold Coast.
Unlike over there where the highway and the el train keep the ghetto cut off.
So they made some minor alterations.
They covered the cinder block in plaster and sold the lot off as condos.
How much did you pay for this place?
Don't ask.
Now, wait till you see this.
Here's the proof.
The killer, or killers... they don't know which... smashed their way through the back of this cabinet.
See? There's no wall there.
There's only a medicine chest separating us from the other apartment.
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
There could be somebody on the toilet.
- No, the apartment is vacant.
- Are you sure?
There.
OK, now take a look.
That is amazing.
- What?
- There's somebody there. I saw a light.
There's nobody there.
Psych.
That's not funny.
- You didn't scare me at all.
- Yeah, right.
Ow.
You don't believe all that nonsense, do you?
I don't. Do you?
No.
All right.
Candyman, Candyman,
Candyman, Candyman...
...Candyman.
Oh, you chicken!
You have to do it five times.
Come on.
- I did it.
- Better safe than sorry.
Trevor?
No, no!
What's the matter?
Oh, Trevor!
Who were you expecting?
What time is it?
It's late and I'm smashed.
Sorry I scared you.
What's with the arsenal,
Bernadette?
We're only going eight blocks.
You're the one who got us dressed up like cops.
I just said dress conservatively.
We look like cops.
Why are you trying to scare me?
I'm not trying to scare you.
I just want you to think.
The gangs hold this neighbourhood hostage.
OK, let's just turn around then.
Let's just go back and we can write a boring thesis regurgitating the usual crap on urban legend.
We've got a real shot here,
Bernadette.
An entire community starts attributing the daily horrors of their lives to a mythical figure.
Now, if Trevor and Archie were in on this do you think they'd chicken out?
In a second.
Exactly.
All right.
- You want to wait here for me?
- No.
Well, let's go.
And lock the car.
Hey now.
Want something, baby?
I got it for you.
Yo, baby...
Which way you going?
Just going inside.
Yeah?
Hey, come up in here.
Who you looking for?
A friend of ours.
Sure you not the police?
Look like five-oh to me.
Ask blondie where she going.
Who you going to see?
Let's take the stairs.
Come on.
Hands up, people!
Five-oh coming up the back door.
It's OK they think we're cops.
They're not going to follow us.
Hang on.
Look at this.
This is great.
"Sweets to... "
"... to the sweet. "
"Sweets to the sweet. "
Hurry up, Helen.
Let me just get the door.
Sorry.
Jesus, Helen.
- Here it is.
- Don't go in there.
Come on.
Come on.
Jesus, it stinks.
See, I was right.
The layout is identical which means the bathroom is over there.
- Helen...
- What's the problem?
A woman died in there.
Leave it.
It's all right.
There's nothing to see.
Wait a minute.
This is where he crawled through, right?
Yeah.
Well, we found it.
Let's go.
Wait a second.
OK, hang onto this.
What?
I'm just going to go through and when I get back, we're out of here.
You've got to be kidding.
It's just a derelict apartment.
What if somebody's packing drugs in there?
You just going to apologise and give them your card?
All right, let's listen.
There's nobody in there.
OK, but hurry up.
Be careful.
Give me the camera.
You've got five minutes.
OK, five.
Dammit.
Bernadette...
I ran out of film. I've got to back.
- No way.
- You can't believe...
No way, Helen.
We're out of here.
What you all doing in there?
We're just leaving.
You here for the sweep?
No. We're not cops.
We're from the university.
Well, you don't belong here, lady... going through people's apartments and things.
I'm Helen Lyle and this is Bernadette Walsh.
We're doing a thesis and were wondering if we could talk to you for a few minutes.
Here, this is my card.
My baby.
Come on.
Come on, let's go.
You know, whites don't never come here except to cause us a problem.
Believe me that's not what we want to do.
Let's go in.
So you say you're doing a study?
What you gonna say?
That we bad?
We steal?
We gang-bang?
We all on drugs, right?
We ain't all like them assholes downstairs, you know?
I just want to raise my child good.
He's a beautiful little boy.
And he's all I got.
- What's his name?
- Anthony.
I'm Anne-Marie.
Anne-Marie McCoy.
Nice to meet you.
Sorry we disturbed you.
We'll just get out of your way.
It's OK.
I mean, I don't mean to be rude, and it's... you know, it's just... the white folks that come around here ain't too hand-shaking with us, you know?
- Hey, what you doing?
- Let me help you.
You making a mess here?
Thank you.
Thanks.
You got kids?
No, but I'd love one.
Hey.
Got my eye on this one big time.
Yeah.
They're not going to get him.
You want to know about Ruthie Jean?
They all been here, you know.
Newspapers, cops, case workers...
They all want to know.
I heard her screaming.
I heard right through the walls.
I dialled 911.
Nobody came.
Nobody came.
Everybody scared.
He could come right through these walls, you know?
I'm scared.
Scared for my child.
They ain't never gonna catch him.
- Who?
- Candyman.
If they asked for something, if they saw something they liked, and you point...
They thought it was rude to point.
So what did they do?
Spat over people.
It was quite extraordinary.
- Be nice.
- I am being nice.
So, how are the two most beautiful graduate students getting along?
Trevor tells me you've been dabbling in my favourite subject.
I can't wait to review your data.
I can fit you in tomorrow morning.
We're not ready yet.
That's precisely the moment in which I can be of greatest assistance before you disappear down a path to academic Bolivia.
I've been there.
Actually, Purcell, we're about to bury you.
- Helen...
- What?
We'll have something in a week or so.
It's just that we only went to Cabrini today...
Ah! Cabrini Green?
Candyman country.
Well, if you're after the hook man, Helen, you must read the paper
I wrote about him ten years ago.
You do know the story, don't you?
No.
Then how are you going to bury me?
The legend first appeared in 1890.
Candyman was the son of a slave.
His father had amassed a considerable fortune from designing a device for the mass producing of shoes after the civil war.
Candyman had been sent to all the best schools and had grown up in polite society.
He had a prodigious talent as an artist and was much sought after when it came to the documenting of one's wealth and position in society in a portrait.
Well, it was in this latter capacity that he was commissioned by a wealthy landowner to capture his daughter's virginal beauty.
Well, of course, they fell deeply in love and she became pregnant.
Poor Candyman.
Her father executed a terrible revenge.
He paid a pack of brutal hooligans to do the deed.
They chased Candyman through the town to Cabrini Green where they proceeded to saw off his right hand with a rusty blade.
No one came to his aid.
But this was just the beginning of his ordeal.
Nearby there was an apiary.
Dozens of hives, filled with hungry bees.
They smashed the hives and stole the honeycomb and smeared it over his prone, naked body.
Candyman was stung to death by the bees.
They burned his body on a giant pyre then scattered his ashes over Cabrini Green.
Hello.
Anne-Marie ain't in.
Are you sure?
Yeah. She said you'd be back.
What's your name?
Jake.
Listen, Jake, maybe you can help me out.
I wanted to find out about that woman who got killed.
Do you know anything about that?
Her name was Ruthie Jean.
I don't know nothing.
Did anybody else talk about it?
You know, it's OK to talk to me, Jake... because I'm not a cop so nobody's going to get in trouble.
I can't say nothing or Candyman will get me.
Candyman?
You scared of him?
I ain't scared of nobody but you're crazy walking here on your own.
It ain't safe around here.
Yeah, I know.
But I don't scare too easy either, Jake.
You know, you don't have to tell me.
You could just show me.
And if you show me where Candyman is
I'll make you a promise.
It will be our secret.
Unless you're too scared.
Somebody building a bonfire?
Yeah, for the party.
In there.
Candyman's in there?
My friend Charlie say so.
A boy got killed there.
- Who was he?
- Ain't sure.
Charlie tell me he was weird.
He was crazy?
No, a retard.
His mom was in the store... and the boy, he need to go, you know, to the bathroom.
His mom was taking her time choosing this, looking at that so the boy start moaning.
His mom get mad at him send him across the street.
His mom is at the checkout.
She hears her boy screaming.
Mommy!
Mommy!
There's a big tough guy.
He runs over to check it out.
He come out of there shaking and crying.
He only been in there five seconds.
Come out of there and his hair turned white.
I mean, it turned white just like that.
Was the boy murdered?
Worse.
He's lying on the floor in a pool of blood holding himself.
Mommy! Mommy!
They found it floating in the toilet.
Can't fix that.
Better off dead.
Did Candyman do this?
Listen, you wait here for me, OK?
OK.
Hello?
Candyman.
Oh, excuse me.
I'm done here.
I'll just get out of your way.
Listen, I don't want to interfere with your business.
I'm not a cop.
I'm from the University of Illinois.
I'll just get out of your way.
Come on!
Let me go!
You're not being very smart.
My colleagues know where I am and they're expecting me back.
Now let me go!
I hear you looking for Candyman, bitch.
Well, you found him.
We hear you're looking for Candyman, bitch.
Step back.
Number four step forward and say the line.
We hear you're looking for Candyman, bitch.
Step back.
Number five step forward and say the line.
We hear you're looking for Candyman, bitch.
Step back.
Take 'em out.
It's number five.
Good work.
How d'you catch him?
We swept the place.
We start from the top floor and work our way down.
That way you can flush 'em all out.
Whole of Cabrini is locked down now.
You're very lucky to be alive,
Ms Lyle.
Did he kill Ruthie Jean?
No question.
Killed that poor kid as well.
He ran the overlords.
We knew everything about him.
Only reason why we didn't bring him in before because we couldn't find anyone to testify.
We can't protect them down at Cabrini Green and they knew that.
What about the little boy... Jake?
We don't need him.
We have you.
Hey, Jake.
I just wanted to thank you for saving my life.
I wanna go home.
We'll get you out of here.
You did good.
You said it was our secret.
You lied!
It still is, Jake.
You won't have to go to court.
Candyman will get me.
Candyman isn't real.
He's just a story.
You know, like Dracula or... or Frankenstein.
A bad man took his name so he could scare us.
But now he's locked up everything's going to be OK.
Candyman ain't real?
No.
Hey there!
Whoa. Slow down.
You're supposed to be the invalid here.
Look, see?
It's much better today.
Yeah, it looks great.
Come sit down.
You haven't eaten already?
No, of course not.
OK, good.
Hey!
Welcome back.
Thanks.
Let me see.
I'm so glad you're OK.
But you know what bugs me about the whole thing?
Two people get brutally murdered and the cops do nothing.
A white woman gets attacked and they lock the place down.
This was a bad guy.
You got him put away.
That's what matters.
Oh! I've got a surprise for you.
What?
You're not going to believe it.
The pictures.
My friend in the photography department managed to save most of them.
I'd written them off.
The camera was smashed.
I've been talking to some publishers and there's a lot of interest since you made the local section.
We're going to be published.
I'll come over tomorrow at 9:00.
- We'll get started?
- Yeah.
Helen...
Yes?
Helen...
Who is that?
Who is that?
Helen...
I came for you.
Do I know you?
No... no... but you doubted me.
I'm sorry.
I have to go.
No need to leave yet.
But I'm late.
You were not content with the stories so I was obliged to come.
Be my victim.
Be my victim.
I am the writing on the wall the whisper in the classroom.
Without these things
I am nothing so now I must shed innocent blood.
Come with me.
No!
Anthony!
Anthony!
No! No! No!
No, Anthony!
Anthony!
Anthony!
Anne-Marie?
No! You did it!
You! You did it!
You murdered my baby!
You murderer!
No! No!
Stop! Please, stop!
Now stop!
Stop!
Police! Open up!
All right, hold it right there!
Back away! Now!
Look out!
Remove your sweater.
Drop it and slide it over to me.
Take off your brassiere.
Can I please take a shower?
Oh...
Oh, God...
Drop it, slide it over to me.
Lift up your arms.
Lift your left breast.
Your right.
Remove your underwear.
Can I please speak with detective Valento?
Remove your underwear.
Frank.
Ms Lyle, you're under arrest.
Do you understand?
Please let me explain.
Do you understand?
Yes, but...
You have the right to remain silent.
Do you understand?
This is crazy.
I was attacked.
Respond to the question.
I understand.
At approximately 10:00 pm.
Anne-Marie McCoy returned to her apartment.
She discovered her dog with its head cut off.
She cried for assistance at which point you attacked her with a meat cleaver.
You were still in possession of this weapon when the arresting officers came to her aid.
Where's the baby?
I... I don't know.
You're sick.
Before I ask any further questions would you like to have counsel?
Yes or no?
I... I'd like to make a phone call.
I'm sorry, we can't take your call.
Please leave a message after the tone.
Trevor, are you there?
Pick up.
It's an emergency, Trevor.
Pick up the phone.
I've been arrested.
I'm at the 18th district.
Can you... can you please come pick me up?
That's it.
Do you know what time it is?
3:00 am.
Noooo!
No!
Oh, God.
There's got to be another way out.
Cover her face.
Don't say anything.
OK.
All right.
You'll be fine.
Just keep your head down.
It's going to be fine.
All right, people, back off, back off!
We have no comment.
No comment.
Nothing to say.
Do you know the baby's whereabouts?
My client has not been charged with a thing!
Information has indicated that baby Anthony was abducted and may still be alive.
The blood may have come from the dog.
A suspect was released this morning after questioning and I guess we'll just have to follow this one...
Well, at least they didn't mention your name.
That's good.
Now, they haven't charged you, because they think they'll find the body which means, I'm afraid they're shooting for murder one, but I don't think they have a chance.
Do you think I did it?
No. Nobody believes that.
But it's crossed your mind?
Is there anything, any detail, however small, that you can recall, that would help us substantiate your version of events?
I... I blacked out.
I mean,
I don't know what happened.
I just woke up in that place and there was blood everywhere.
Can I get you anything?
Are you sure?
Look, honey...
I was supposed to go to the campus and pick up some work.
I'm concerned about leaving you alone though.
I'll only be about 20 minutes.
Trevor...
Where were you last night?
I was here.
I was fast asleep.
I thought you were with Bernadette.
Look, honey...
I'm going to stand by you.
We're going to get through this OK?
I'll be right back.
Believe in me.
Be my victim.
Do you believe in me?
Keep away from me.
I have the child.
Allow me to take you or he will die in your place.
Your disbelief destroyed the faith of my congregation.
Without them,
I am nothing.
So I was obliged to come.
And now I must kill you.
Your death will be a tale to frighten children, to make lovers cling closer in their rapture.
Come with me and be immortal.
Helen?
Bernadette...
Bernadette, go.
Helen?
Helen, honey.
It's Bernadette.
Let me in.
He's here.
Bernadette, go!
Helen!
Helen?
Go! Get out!
Oh, no, no...
Trevor...
Trevor, he's here.
He's here. He's...
...here.
Don't let him kill me.
Trevor...
Trevor...
Trevor...
Trevor!
Trevor!
Trevor! Trevor!
Take her outside.
Trevor...
Hold me, Trevor, please?
'That's correct.
'Unit 212, come in, please. '
'Why do you want to live?
'If you had learned just a little from me
'you would not beg to live.
'I am rumour.
'It is a blessed condition, believe me.
'To be whispered about at street corners,
'to live in other people's dreams
'but not to have to be.
'Do you understand?'
'Please, God,
'don't let him kill the baby. '
Trevor!
Trevor?
Trevor!
Where are you going?
No, you can't leave me here.
I can't defend myself!
No.
What do the good know except what the bad teach them by their excesses?
Murderer.
Allow me at least a kiss.
Just one exquisite kiss.
Murderer!
Help!
Listen, he's under the bed!
Bring me 1,000 mils!
Listen, he's here.
He's under the bed!
No, don't.
She's coming around.
Good morning.
I'd like to speak to my husband.
So would I.
Here we go.
What time is it?
Where are we going?
We're going to Disneyland.
Clyde, open it up.
Winley?
Clyde, open it up.
What the hell you all doing back there, huh?
A little reading?
Break.
Dr Burke?
Yes?
Miss Lyle,
I'm Dr Burke.
I'd like to speak to my husband.
I'm sure we can arrange a visit.
A visit?
Have I been committed?
Do you really think these restraints are necessary?
Helen, this... is a writ of detention from the state attorney's office.
Now, for the past month...
- Month?
- Yes.
...we have been stabilizing you on a heavy dosage of Thorazine.
You probably remember very little or nothing.
Get me my attorney.
I'm working for your defence.
We have to assess your ability to stand trial.
Helen, you've been charged with first-degree murder.
Why don't you tell me what happened in your apartment?
'Oh!'
The night you were admitted did the killer appear to you?
'Murderer!
'Murderer!
'Murderer!
'Help me!
'He's here!
'He's under the bed!
'No!
'Help me!'
I don't understand.
'Help! Please!
'He's here!
'Help me! Help me!
'Please!
'He's under the bed!
'He's under the bed!'
That's not possible.
'Bring me 1,000 mils!'
Bernadette...
I'm not capable of that.
No matter what's going wrong...
I know one thing...
...that no part of me, no matter how hidden is capable of that.
I can prove it.
How?
I can call him.
Candyman...
Candyman...
Candyman...
...Candyman.
Oh! Oh!
You're mine now.
Tonight our congregation shall witness a new... miracle.
Dr Burke?
Dr Burke?
Dr Burke!
Please answer us!
Dr Burke!
Code nine to ward b-5, stat.
Check the west wing.
Let's go!
Go, go, go!
Do we have a direction on this one?
Where is she?
Please be home, Trevor.
Please be home.
Get out of my home.
Trevor!
What's the matter, sweetie pie?
Did you make another little boo-boo?
What are you doing here?
I live here, remember?
Call the hospital.
Don't touch the phone.
What's the matter, Trevor?
Scared of something?
I hate the color scheme.
What were you going to do?
Wait till I got out before you told me?!
Helen...
But you knew
I was never coming out, didn't you?
I think we should call the hospital.
OK.
Go on.
Go on.
Is that what you want to do?
Call them.
I'm not a murderer.
I'm not.
Trevor, you were all I had left.
Oh...
It's over.
If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again.
They will all abandon you.
All you have left is my desire for you.
Helen.
You came to me.
The child.
We had a deal.
Surrender to me now and he shall be unharmed.
We have a bargain.
But I'm afraid.
Do you fear the pain or what is beyond?
Both.
The pain, I can assure you, will be exquisite.
As for our deaths, there is nothing to fear.
Our names will be written on a thousand walls.
Our crimes told and retold by our faithful believers.
We shall die together in front of their very eyes and give them something to be haunted by.
Come with me and be immortal.
No!
No!
Hush.
Hush.
You're mine now.
It's time for a new miracle.
It was always you, Helen.
It was always you.
He's here.
I'm coming.
It's OK.
Check it out, man.
Oh, yes.
What happened?
We got the Candyman out there.
I saw him go in there.
Candyman's in there.
I saw him.
I knew you'd come.
Burn him.
Hush.
Burn him, burn him, burn him, burn him...
Burn him, burn him!
Help!
Burn him, burn him, burn him!
Help... help me!
Burn him, burn him!
You lied to me!
We must be on our way now, you and I.
Our bones will soon be ashes and we shall never be separated again.
Let me go.
I cannot.
We are already dead.
Helen!
Come back to me!
Come back!
We commend to almighty God our sister Helen and we commit her body to the ground.
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
The lord bless her and keep her and give her peace.
God of holiness and power accept our prayers on behalf of your servant Helen.
Do not count her deeds against her.
For in her heart she desired to do your will.
May almighty God bless you the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
My God, look at that.
Trevor?
Trevor?
What is it?
Trevor, are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Aren't you hungry?
No, I'm OK.
I'll eat a little bit later.
I was going to make us a nice dinner.
OK, whatever.
Hey, why don't you help me make the salad?
OK, I'll be there in a minute.
Helen...
Oh, Helen.
Helen.
Helen.
Helen.
Ow.
What's the matter, Trevor?
Scared of something?
Trevor?
My God, Trevor?
Trevor?
Trevor!
Look alive!
Damn it!
Goddamn it!
You call that blocking, you pussy-pukes?
You gotta pick up the linebacker!
Goddamn it! Get off the fucking field, you limp-ass blowdicks!
Consider yourselves dead
Friday night! Dead!
You gonna rejoin the living tomorrow, Stan?
You've got to feel the pressure closing in on you!
Then you get rid of the rock!
Now get focused or get the fuck off my team!
- Shit!
- Let it go.
This better be important or somebody's gonna be doing laps until sunrise.
Yeah? What?
Please let me finish this so we can go home. It's late.
Mrs Brummel, with all sadness, no new computers.
But...
Get the service guy down here and get the old ones juiced.
Mr Tate, you're dreaming.
Absolutely no field trips to New York City.
I don't think that you understand.
You're not getting out of Ohio. Rethink it.
And, finally,
Mrs Olson.
There's just no money for a musical this year.
But I bet the football team gets their new jerseys and their new equipment.
Have you seen the football stadium on a Friday night, Mr Tate?
The entire town is there. This is a football town, let me remind you, and, yes, the team will get new jerseys and new knee pads... and new jock straps and anything else they want in the name of education... because that is what the school board wants.
Because that is what the parents in this town want.
I'm sorry.
My frustrated hands are tied.
I don't see why we can't have a few new computers... so the children will learn a little set up.
Miss Drake, the Drama Club had their heart set on Guys and Dolls this year.
Well... maybe if they use last year's set from Our Town.
Shit, I forgot my keys.
I have to go back.
See you in the morning,
Mrs Olson.
Coach Willis.
What can I do for you?
You look... very, very pretty tonight,
- Miss Drake.
- Have you been drinking, Coach?
I'm sorry to bother you, but...
I can't seem to find a pencil.
You don't need a pencil, Coach.
You need a good night's sleep.
- I need a pencil.
- Sleep it off, Coach.
Do you have a pencil?
Jesus Christ, yes, I have a pencil.
I have plenty of pencils.
Look, why don't you and your pencil go home. It's late.
You look... very, very pretty tonight.
Harassment has a really fine line,
Coach. Haven't you read your handbook?
I've always wanted to do that.
Would Miss Drake please report... to the principal's office?
- I forgot my grade book.
- Unlock the door! Coach Willis attacked me!
- Unlock the door, goddamn it!
- I don't have my keys.
- Let me get help.
- No, don't leave me!
- Where are your keys?
- Wait...
In the office.
I'm gonna get my keys now,
Mrs Olson.
- Please, let me get help.
- No, just talk to me, okay?
Miss Drake... please be careful.
He's insane.
Miss Drake, he's coming!
Hurry! Hurry!
Hurry, Miss Drake!
Hurry!
Hurry!
- Shit!
- No!
Hurry!
Help me!
Prick.
I always wanted to do that.
You fucking bitch!
What the hell were you doing?
Whatever.
All right?
Sorry. My fault.
Crash and burn, Casey.
Get out of the fucking car, you stupid bitch!
Goddamn you!
- You okay?
- Walk much?
You ran into me, beast.
Okay, now listen up.
Since we're all wearing the same uniforms, let's keep the hair the same.
No hair spray, no teasing, just elegant.
- Simple. Great.
- Hey.
Stan, watch it. Those are Estee Lauder lips.
Takes 72 minutes to apply.
Sorry.
- Hey, can we talk?
- I can't right now.
I need a new headline for the school paper. It's important.
- So is this.
- I'm sure you think so, honey.
In fact... it could be just the story you're looking for.
Do the words "editor-in-chief" mean anything to you?
Leave the news to me, okay?
Later.
That chick weakens legs, meat.
- One, two, three...
- No, not the pole!
Yeah, do it again!
Yeah!
Excuse me.
Could you please tell me where the office is? It's my first day here.
Thank you.
I'm Marybeth Louise Hutchinson.
I really love what you've done with your nose ring. It brings out the colour in your eyes.
You're such a fucking pussy.
Hey, fuck you! Fuck you!
Fuck you, man!
Fuck you!
Dude, that's not me.
Doesn't even look like me.
It's fifty bucks, right?
- Does that look like me?
- It's the new you.
I don't know, man. How do we know these things are even gonna work?
Trust me, man.
I'm brilliant.
Then why are you repeating your senior year?
All right, look, man.
I'll throw in a couple hits of this.
Scat. My own recipe.
Guaranteed to jack you up.
Up the nose, right?
Whatever works, man.
Fuck.
Excuse me, Mr Tate.
Try to remember, Harry, the projector's got teeth.
Sharp ones.
We should be getting hazard pay for this sort of faulty equipment.
- Yeah, right.
- Hey, good morning, Miss Harper.
I...
I called you this weekend.
I got your machine.
How's your cold?
- I can't get rid of it.
- Hello. How are you today?
A bit tired, but no complaints.
I got it.
Can we say,
"retirement"?
Maybe you should just go home.
No, thank you.
I'm saving my sick days for when I feel better.
Maybe I should just put a pen in my eye.
When will that bitch turn the air conditioning back on?
Hey, speaking of which, has anybody seen Principal Drake?
Maybe she had a sunstroke and died.
What's up with the coach?
He's thirsty.
Probably a pregame ritual.
Just looking at him makes me want to take a piss.
Good morning, Mrs Olson.
You look very, very pretty today.
So... what was Crusoe's... greatest fear?
Anyone?
Yes, Zeke.
Crusoe's afraid that he'd be stuck on that island forever... with nothing but calluses.
No, that's not correct.
Isolation was his greatest fear.
Yes, but... his external existence in no way compared... to the internal agony of the loneliness he felt.
That's very good.
Like I said, calluses.
So Cathy tells me one thing, and then Liz says another... and then, of course,
Jenny's got her own story, so which one do you want me to print?
Print them all.
He's a jerk.
- Hey, we need to talk.
- No, Stan, baby, I'm in a crunch.
Could we back-burner it?
- I'm quitting football.
- You're not playing tomorrow?
I'm not playing this year.
Would you listen to me?
I'm quitting the team.
I'm not playing ball... anymore.
What brought this on?
Well, I've been weighing the importance of being a jock...
- with my impending future, and I decided...
- You just decided?
Stan, what about college? The football scholarship is your only shot.
If I quit now, I can work harder at studying, maybe raise my grades a little.
I'd rather go to college... based on my intellect.
You're not good at studying.
Stan, you're good at football.
Stick to what you're good at.
Yeah, I've always been good at football and basketball and every other sport I try.
I think maybe it's time I try something
I'm not so good at, something different.
And what am I supposed to do while you're on a yellow-brick quest for a brain?
- What?
- The accepted social order... is head cheerleaders date star quarterbacks, not academic wanna-bes.
Don't be superficial.
"Superficial."
Four syllables.
That's really good, Stan.
You're on your way.
Let me know how the cancer cure goes.
I was hoping you'd be with me on this.
Now, if everyone will turn to chapter four:
"The Nation of the State."
"Only through conformity among the masses... can the unified state offer the benefits of power order and security."
Actually, we covered that last week, Mr Tate.
We're on chapter five.
Whatever.
Now if you could all please join Stan on chapter five:
"Individual Action in Society."
What are you reading?
Double Star.
Robert Heinlein.
You one of those science fiction people?
Y'all believe in alternate universes and alien beings and stuff?
I'm feeling pretty alien myself today.
I'm Marybeth Louise Hutchinson of Atlanta. I'm new here.
- No shit.
- What's your name?
Why do you want to know my name?
'Cause I don't have any friends.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you seem to have one less than that.
- So I just thought... - Stokely, are you seducing the new students again?
Hi. I'm Delilah.
- Happy to have you at Herrington.
- Thank you.
Don't you love the way Stokely accessorizes different shades of black in her ensemble?
- Fuck you, gutter slut.
- I don't know why you insist... on being such a bad example for your people.
- What people? - I hope you're not a violent lesbian like your new friend.
No.
I'm not aware of any lesbianism in my lineage.
That's too bad, Stokely. You'll just have to keep looking for Miss Right.
Bipolar bitch.
Violent.
Yeah.
- What are you doing?
- I was just eating my lunch, sir.
This ain't the cafeteria, son.
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry about that, sir.
You're...
- I forget your name.
- Casey.
Right.
I've seen you around.
You're not really into sports.
I don't think a person should run unless he's being chased.
"Being chased."
I like that.
Get outta here.
- Mrs Brummel, may I have a word with you?
- Certainly.
Man, get a fucking eye dog.
Maybe if you didn't paint your fucking eyes shut.
- Mr Furlong.
- Present.
Found something on the football field.
Thought you might want to take a look.
- What is it?
- I was hoping you could tell me.
Want to be lab partners?
I didn't know you were a lesbian.
I don't think
I've ever met one before.
Have you been out long?
I think it's very impressive and evolved of you...
I'm not a lesbian, all right?
Be one. Please.
Fly free.
You were right about me. I don't have any friends, and I like it that way.
- Being a lesbian is just my security.
- Your security against what?
People like you.
Complex.
Certain mesozoan... only exist in the kidney of certain squid and octopi.
- Which doesn't make sense because...
- This is Ohio.
Right.
It's a pelagic organism.
- What's pelagic?
- A sea-dwelling organism.
Exactly.
But I don't recognize this surface tissue at all.
Casey, I don't want to blow smoke up your butt, but I think you found a new species.
Yeah, right.
It could happen. New species are discovered every day.
- Don't be so cynical.
- Could it be gnathostomulida?
- No. - They escaped detection till the mid-20th century.
You just know everything.
I'm a contradiction.
Check the mesodermic follicles on its underbelly.
- What does that mean?
- It means we gotta call the university, let them take a look, maybe get in on some of that federal grant money.
Our secret... all right?
- Hey, Stokely, maybe it's from your planet.
- Blow me, blood fart.
Did you see that?
What is it doing?
- You think it's amphibian?
- Water resuscitated it.
Yeah, but couldn't this kill it?
Yeah, you don't want to drown it.
- One way to find out.
- Man.
It's all right.
It's okay.
Mr Furlong, what are you doing?
I'm just gonna check his prostate.
Actually, the surface texture changed, so... I want to feel it.
It can replicate.
Jesus.
Fuck!
Goddamn it!
- I'm okay.
- It has teeth.
Where did it get teeth?
I'm gonna call the university.
I've just been thinking ahead, Coach, and...
I've decided to quit the team... and concentrate on my academics.
Okay.
Stan, we'll miss you.
That's it?
Well, what do you want me to say?
My star quarterback comes to me the day before we play Brun County, the only team in the district that can kick our ass, and tells me he doesn't want to play.
There's something up with that.
You seem to be going through some life-defining turning point, and I'm not gonna stand in the way of the human condition.
You do what you have to do.
Thanks for not reaming me,
Coach.
What kind of human being would I be if I did that?
Hey, give me that back.
Hey, yo, piss wad, you're in my way.
I'm sorry.
I was breathing here.
Yeah, that's the problem.
You're occupying my air, you anal probe.
Hey.
Yo, Stan.
Tomorrow night, right?
That's right.
We'll kill them!
We draw blood! Yeah!
- It must really blow being you.
- You have no idea.
Yo, Casey, is that you?
- Mrs Brummel, what the fuck...
- Please.
Help me.
I can't breathe.
Get help!
You don't know what's happening.
They want everyone.
It's okay.
Is Mrs Brummel gonna be okay?
Stan, Mrs Brummel has been diagnosed with cancer, and she's on a lot of medication at the moment.
It causes disorientation.
We were hoping that she would get through the school year, but unfortunately it...
I hope you can understand the sensitive nature of the situation.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I can keep it quiet.
Casey? You understand?
Casey, you understand?
- Casey?
- Yeah.
Sure.
- It's Neve Campbell?
- And Jennifer Love Hewitt, right?
Yep.
Party of prettiness.
- And they're naked?
- Full frontal.
Zeke, you cannot conduct personal business on school property.
Well, Miss Burke, we have a problem... because I'm sitting on my car and that's my property.
Well, I've had complaints from several students... that you've sold them mind-altering substances.
You want to tell me about it or take it up with Principal Drake?
You're too tense, Miss Burke, but I've got just the thing for you.
You know, Zeke, I'm the authority figure here. It's time you realized that.
"For gentle relief of blockage caused by dietary stress."
- Chocolate-flavoured laxatives.
- You know... if you applied just five percent...
- of that intellect to your studies,
- Not a chocolate lover? you could have made up your finals last summer.
- You didn't have to repeat your senior year.
- How about these?
Condoms.
Magnum-sized, and they're cherry-flavoured.
Come on, Miss Burke.
They're on me.
That's so rude.
I need a lead story.
I have no page one.
Well, we found a new phylum in Biology. It's bizarre.
Really bizarre. Mr Furlong thinks it might be a new species.
Let me race to the stands for that issue.
- Why do you rag on me so much? What did I do?
- Nothing.
It's just your fate.
You're that geeky Stephen King kid.
There's one of you in every school.
- We can't go in here.
- Come on, Casey.
You're with me.
Be brave.
Okay, so what are we looking for?
Anything.
Nurse Harper is medicated.
Big surprise.
Hey.
No, I exposed Mr Tate's alcoholism last year. Nobody cares.
Well, his wife certainly didn't when she ran off with the baby-sitter.
God.
- You can be such a...
- What? pretty cool human being when you're not being a first-class, grade-A bitch.
You hitting on me, Casey?
No. No.
I just think you can be cool.
Sometimes.
This not being one of them.
- Where's Brummel?
- She didn't make it.
Her body was too old.
The heat got to her.
Be careful of the climate.
It compromises your nervous system.
It makes one impulsive.
Has the entire faculty been commuted?
Almost.
- What about the students?
- Soon.
What are you two still doing here?
I thought I was the only left.
There are not enough drugs in this world.
What?
I have a pain.
Right here.
Get off of me! Jesus!
Casey!
What the hell is going on?
- Slow down there. - Help us.
They killed Mrs Brummel. They're after us.
What are you talking about?
- Coach Willis.
- And Mrs Olson.
- What's going on?
- Ask Nurse Harper, okay? They attacked her.
Who attacked who?
What is going on?
I have no idea. I joined this right in the middle of it.
Mrs Brummel wigged out in the shower, and then we found her body in the faculty closet.
What were you doing in the faculty closet?
- Coach Willis and Mrs Olson attacked
Nurse Harper. - Why would they do that?
There's Nurse Harper.
Just ask her.
Now we can get to the bottom of this.
- Fuck.
- Delilah, run!
Delilah, wait!
In here?
Yes. The body was in the closet.
- And why would Mrs Brummel be in the closet?
- Because they killed her.
- That's right.
- Hey, Casey.
Sorry about that mix-up earlier.
Didn't mean to scare you.
Apparently, there's been a misunderstanding.
Still, if we could just see inside the closet.
Certainly.
- It's a doll.
- Meet Resuscitation Annie.
We use her to teach C.P.R. to the students, although I guess she does resemble Mrs Brummel slightly.
- You dialled 911 for a dead doll?
- That wasn't there.
They put that there.
Look, I'm not making this up.
- You gotta call Delilah.
- We called her. She isn't home.
She was here with me.
She saw it too.
They attacked Nurse Harper.
- Nurse Harper is epileptic. She's prone to grand mals. - She had an attack.
Luckily, she carries her medicine in her bag, so we were able to help her.
We think it was brought on by this terrible cold she's had. I took her home myself.
- You can call her if you like.
- It is procedure.
You can use the phone in my office.
That was some fast running you did down the hall, son.
We could sure use your speed.
There's plenty of chasing on the field.
Did you hear that, Casey?
He said you had speed.
- Thank you.
- Good luck in that game tomorrow, Coach.
This way.
Cas, what's gotten into you?
Evelyn knows someone downtown.
A professional.
I'm gonna make an appointment.
He's a straight-A student, and now he needs a professional?
- Christ.
- I don't need a shrink. I know what I saw.
Well, we've just spoken... with both Mrs Brummel and Nurse Harper.
- They got him.
- There's nothing here.
Just some kid looking for some attention. Let's go.
All right.
Well...
I am so sorry,
Miss Drake.
Maybe if you and I spoke privately, we could come up with...
No. No, Mom.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I should see this woman, this doctor.
Can we just go?
We'll take care of this at home, Miss
Drake. Again, sorry for all the trouble.
I can see how it all got out of hand.
It's a pretty bizarre series of events.
It's our fault.
It won't happen again.
See you tomorrow, Casey.
Check his school books.
They hide the drugs in the spine of the book. We saw it on Dateline.
- What are you on, son?
- I'm not on drugs.
That's government property, Dad.
Shit.
Look, we love you, son.
We want to help you.
Then believe me.
I'm telling the truth.
Something really weird is happening at school. The teachers...
- Something's happened to them.
- Don't push it, all right?
- I'm bending as far as I can, but if you push it... - Just let me call Delilah.
Please?
Okay, that's it.
Your privileges are now over.
No phone. Sorry. Over.
No internet.
You'll go to school, straight to school, and you'll come straight home. You got it?
I'm not going back to that school.
They're waiting for me.
You'll go. If I have to tie you to the desk myself, you'll go.
No music.
His porno.
Porno.
Sorry, pal. No more flogging the bishop.
We are gonna get you help. Don't worry.
Get your room cleaned up.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Dad. They're here.
The faculty.
Get in the house, now.
I'm losing it.
- Go on, son.
- Dad, I'm begging you.
Please.
Come home right after school.
Your mom's looking into a doctor.
Mr Connor.
Delilah.
Wow, you look...
Don't. Come on.
Your attention, please.
Will the following students report to the office:
James Archuleta,
Tina Dannhausen, and Delilah Proffitt.
- This is all your fault.
- What do you mean?
Do you think I'm in drag for the aesthetics?
They're after me.
- Did you tell your parents?
- My mom didn't believe me.
She drinks.
It was a nightmare.
- Look, we have to go to the police.
- No.
- They've got the police.
- We don't know what they've got.
Look, you saw it.
Mrs Brummel was dead.
- They attacked Nurse Harper.
- "They"? Who are "they"?
Casey, we don't even know who "they" are.
Why did she act like everything was okay?
It's a devil's cult or something.
Maybe they worship comets.
Who the fuck knows?
I'm not gonna stay in a handicapped bathroom for the rest of my life.
- They couldn't have gotten to everyone.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to find Stan.
- Stan? Why Stan?
Will the following students please report to the office:
Jennifer Qulick,
Randy Knotson and Thomas Nicks.
You should just go talk to him.
No way.
I'm sorry.
So you... Are you ready for the big game?
I quit the team.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
Why?
Just tired of everyone kissing my ass
'cause I'm captain of the football team.
You know... the coach, the students, even the teachers.
Last year after we won the 2A Conference...
That was thanks to you and your completed passes.
You follow the games?
I wouldn't have guessed that.
I made a "D" on a biology test right after, and Mr Furlong changed it to an "A."
He said I deserved for having such a strong arm.
That really bugged me, you know?
I worked hard for that "D."
That was my "D." I deserved that "D."
I just wish people would let me be, you know...
A "D" student.
Yeah.
Okay, class, listen up.
Today we are going to write a living family history.
Everyone take out a piece of paper and write down the name... of every living member of your family.
Begin with your immediate family... those living with you... then include the names of your nearest living relatives.
What?
- Is this gonna be on the test?
- This is the test.
What is that?
It's magic dust.
- You want some?
- No, I have a low tolerance, but thank you.
- You sure?
- I'm allergic to aspirin, so that would probably kill me.
- We wouldn't want to do that.
- No.
I'm Marybeth Louise Hutchinson of Atlanta.
Atlanta.
I know.
That's right.
You know everything.
I'm Zeke.
- I know.
- It's a pleasure.
The pleasure's all mine.
There's a mandatory meeting in the office at lunch today for all club presidents.
Remember, tonight we take on the Brun County Changa.
- Please come at 5:30 and show your support.
- Hey, that's mine.
Weird, isn't it?
- What do you think it is?
- Locker search maybe?
Something weird is going on here.
Hey, Football.
Hey, Gabe.
- You're not pissed, are you?
- About what?
I'm the new team captain.
What's going on here?
Nurse Harper, she's giving an ear exam or some shit like that.
And that takes the police?
Stan, I need to talk to you.
I didn't know you wore glasses.
Contacts.
Come on, it's important.
Stokely, got a second?
I need your help.
So after the accident, I came here to live with relatives, you know.
So I moved in with my cousins and... here I am.
Fucking do something, you pussy puke!
Yeah, my mom and dad are dead too.
- Really?
- Yeah.
They're still breathing, but for all intents and purposes, they're very much dead.
You've fucking gone weird.
Fuck you, you pussy.
- Fuck you!
- You and I have a lot in common then.
Yeah.
- You notice anything off today here at school?
- I'm from the south.
- Y'all are off.
- Dude, we need some scat.
Yeah, man, we can't deal.
There's some weird shit going down here.
Five bucks a pop. Hey, man, how's the new you working out?
Working out just fine.
Hey, you got any more?
- Sure, man.
- Really?
Why don't you give us all you got?
All right.
Dough.
- You got any more?
- Not on me, man.
- What about in your locker?
- How about in your car? Got any more there?
- Use in moderation, boys.
- Come on, Zeke. Hook us up.
- Check out Miss Burke.
- Wow, what happened to her?
Man, I'm really not in the mood,
Miss Burke. I'm clean.
- What's up with her?
- Not today.
It's too damn hot, and I got zero-fucking-tolerance.
Eat me, you asshole. I'm the one with no tolerance, you pathetic little runt.
Ouch. Comeback.
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna call my mother?
And how am I supposed to do that, little Zekey boy?
Do you even know where she is?
Europe, Sri Lanka, Japan? I wonder what remote location she went to this week... to hide from her great big bastard mistake.
I've taken your shit for too fucking long, you dickless drug-induced excuse for a human being.
- Woman, what are you on?
- "Woman"? Did you just say, "woman"?
I'm sick of you, little boy.
And if I see you peddling your wonder dust again,
I'm gonna shove my foot so far up your ass... you'll be sucking my toes till graduation.
Big trouble.
She got some bad shit.
And then they chased us, but we got away.
All this started when Mrs Brummel did a wet and wild...
- in the boys' locker room?
- I think so.
Everybody's been acting really strange, especially the faculty.
Tell me about it. It's like they've all turned into fucking pod people...
- or something.
- Into what people?
Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
A small town was taken over by aliens.
That was a joke.
Look, what if it really happened?
- What if that really happened?
- I think something's taking over our school.
The Body Snatchers is a story somebody made up, dingus.
It's located in the fiction section of the library.
So is Schindler's List. All fiction is based on some truth, right?
What does Miss Burke teach us in English 101? Write what you know.
How do we know this writer guy...
- Jack Finney.
- didn't encounter aliens in his high school... which led him to write a book about an alien invasion?
- Your conspiracy theory is flawed.
- How so?
Jack Finney's The Body Snatchers is a blatant rip-off... of The Puppet Masters by Robert Heinlein.
So you can completely disregard that entire work.
Whatever.
The point is they're here, they've been here and they're here again.
You know, Casey, I think you've been racked into the flagpole one too many times.
Look, how do you know there's not a conspiracy?
Maybe X-Files is right.
Where do all these movies come from anyway?
How do we know Spielberg,
Lucas, Sonnenfeld,
Emmerich haven't been visited by aliens?
You know, maybe they're aliens themselves.
Maybe they're simply preparing us for what's to come.
You know what, Casey, it's fiction. Okay?
- It's science fiction.
- Exactly.
Everybody gets hung up on the science part, which has nothing to do with it.
They're getting at us through the fiction.
So, aliens have just been setting us up over the years, creating this happy little make-believe existence... with their E.T. and their Men In Black movies... just so that nobody would believe it if it really happened?
I think so.
Yeah.
- You're not buying this, are you?
- No, I'm not.
But it's kind of cool.
Okay, so what's missing?
Well, in The Body Snatchers, they were pods, but where are they?
I mean, where are the pods?
There are no pods.
There's gotta be something else.
In Puppet Masters, they were parasites.
- I filled Stan in.
- Come with us. Stokely's onto something.
Really?
Shit.
Furlong must have sent it up to the university.
- Doubtful.
- Where else could it be?
What? What is it?
Will someone please tell me what the hell's going on here?
It all started yesterday when
I found this thing, this new species.
Which is now missing.
We think aliens are taking over our school.
Right. Come on.
You saw what Brummel did in the shower.
I saw her dead body in the closet.
They've been calling students into the office.
The students with the most influence on down, including the new team captain.
Looks like you picked the right week to quit football.
You think aliens have infested our school?
That would explain their weird behaviour, wouldn't it?
Give me a fucking break.
So, what are we doing in here?
Shopping.
- I've got a very large grocery list.
- What are you talking about?
This is where
I get my equipment.
You borrow it from science labs?
I like to think of it as stealing, actually.
Just doing my part to the deconstruction of America.
So if anybody finds us in here, just grab ahold of me and pretend we're making out.
The punishment will be less severe.
- Aliens?
- Do you have a better explanation, Stan?
Great. Just listen to yourselves.
Our teachers are aliens?
That's not weird, that's fucking psychotic.
Come on, guys.
This is nuts.
Then leave, Stan. Why are you hanging around? Go win a Pulitzer.
Blow me, Delilah,
'cause I'm sick of your shit.
Get the fuck out of here and take your freak dyke with you.
Fuck you, tit bags.
- Will everybody calm down, please?
- All right, Casey.
Let's go alien for a second.
Why here?
Why Ohio?
If you were going to take over the world, would you blow up the White House
Independence Day style... or sneak in through the backdoor?
Casey.
Man, the only person in this school who is an alien... is you, man.
Fuck you, Zeke.
What's going on here?
Shouldn't you people be in class?
Well, it's like this,
Mr Furlong,
Casey here thinks you're an alien.
- Really?
- The whole faculty, actually.
Is that true?
Casey?
The thing I found yesterday...
Where is it?
I sent it to the university.
Do they know what it is?
Look, sorry to impose and disrupt, Mr Furlong, but...
If you'd kindly take your seats, this will be over quite quickly.
Now sit down!
- Put him the fuck down, Furlong.
- This is for the best, Zeke.
Goddamn it!
Come on.
No!
Zeke.
This is usually the point where somebody says, "Let's get the fuck outta here."
Let's get the fuck outta here.
Aliens are taking over the fucking school.
We gotta have proof.
All right, everybody, here's the deal.
We're heading straight for the parking lot.
Pull it together, and try to stay calm.
Stokely.
What's Stan hanging out with those guys for?
Delilah.
My car.
- Where are we going?
- Anywhere but here.
Wait.
Stan!
- There he is. Let's go.
- Where you going, buddy?
- We're going to...
- Come on, Stan. Jesus Christ.
- Get in the fucking car.
- Sure you don't want to play with us?
Nah, Gabe... but thanks.
What the fuck is going on?
Let's see if anybody's talking.
Who the fuck are these guys?
All right, pull over here, fellas.
- Fuck this shit.
- Hey!
- Where's your mom and dad?
- Europe, I think.
Shit.
- My God.
- This is some serious shit.
This is your big secret?
Caffeine pills?
You didn't see that.
What are we gonna do with the police not being an option?
I can call my dad.
He'd know what to do.
If he's even your dad anymore.
It's called a gun, man.
What is it?
We're gonna find out.
Hey, come here, Oscar.
Come here, buddy.
Jeez.
Now what?
I'm sorry, buddy.
See? It's a parasite.
It attaches itself to a host, and then it controls it.
- It's incomplete.
- What do you mean?
It can survive on its own, but it's really part of a greater organism.
Look, it has the ability to replicate, but it needs a host.
Something moist.
See what it did to Oscar's insides.
It dried them out.
Hey, isn't a human body composed mainly of water?
They're using us.
- Drying us out.
- Like Mrs Brummel, right?
I overheard the coach.
Her body was too old.
She didn't take.
See, this partially explains what happened to Furlong.
That drug's a diuretic.
Dries it out. Kills it.
They're using us as hosts. They're just turning us into mindless slaves...
- they can control.
- How do you know that?
She doesn't.
She's a Trekkie sci-fi freak.
Who's been right so far.
How do we stop it?
Yeah, Stokely, this is your area.
In theory, they're all connected.
- If we kill the master, we get them all.
- "In theory."
What happens to everybody else?
The ones who've been taken over?
Do they just die?
No, they don't.
They would become human again.
But that is in theory, so...
So if we found the leader and killed it,
- we'd beat it.
- What are we even talking about?
- I say we get the fuck out of town.
- And go where?
Don't you see? We got to stop it or it's gonna spread.
It took the high school in a day and a half.
Give it a week, we'll never outrun it.
- We have to fight.
- Fight what?
We don't even know who's alien and who's not.
What if one of us was an alien right now? How would we know?
He's right. How do I know you're really Casey?
How do I know you're really you?
In Body Snatchers, humans became emotionless.
- They completely lost their identities.
- The coach had emotion.
I mean, he's usually a real hard-ass, but he was different somehow.
His behaviour was slightly odd.
Like a star quarterback who mysteriously quits the football team?
What are you doing, Delilah?
I'm just pointing out your "slightly odd" behaviour, Stan.
You've been acting really weird the last couple of days.
I'm not an alien,
I'm discontent.
- There's another big word.
- You want to talk slightly odd?
What about you? You haven't been without your contacts... or hair spray since birth.
- I'm incognito.
- We just have to trust each other.
And I'm supposed to trust you? Tell me something,
Miss Lesbian, when did you start liking boys?
- What the fuck you talking about?
- I see the way you look at Stan.
So when did you stop muff-diving?
She's not a lesbian.
That was a hoax.
- Really?
- Yeah.
And what about you,
Miss Atlanta?
It's just really convenient that you showed up the second all these things started happening.
- What are you doing in Ohio anyway?
- It's not my fault.
Hey, shut up.
She's got a point, Zeke.
Yeah, Zeke, Professor.
I mean, you seem to know an awful lot about this stuff.
No offence, but you're not exactly known for your academic achievements.
Neither are you, man.
- Casey, when did you become Sigourney Weaver?
- Wha...
All right, this is getting us nowhere.
I got a solution.
We know this outs them, right?
Take a hit.
No way, man.
I don't do drugs.
Come on, man. If you're not an alien, you got nothing to worry about.
Zeke's right.
This is the only way to know for sure.
Yeah, come on, Stan.
What are you afraid of, man?
Look, we all do it.
- Casey.
- Why me first?
It's your birthright, man.
Just fucking take it.
Easy, boy.
What about you, Zeke? How do we know you're not one of those fucking things?
I don't get high on my own stash, man.
Fuck that, man!
You're taking it.
You're taking it.
Now what the hell's wrong with him?
Nothing's wrong with him, you asshole.
He's tweaking.
Let him fucking tweak!
Tweak. Tweak.
Now you.
Your turn.
Stokely.
I'm not putting that hack drug up my nose.
- It's so '80s.
- Aliens are taking over the Earth. Weigh it.
- What's in it?
- Mostly caffeine. Some other household shit.
Shit.
Now you,
Delilah.
No. Her first.
- I'm allergic.
- Yeah, and I'm Portuguese. Who cares?
Is she always this much fun, man?
Sometimes she can be a real bitch.
You know what I'm saying? You know?
You both take it.
Zeke, I can't.
You know, I can't.
You have to take it.
Showdown.
Del?
Shit!
Shoot her. Shoot her in the head, Casey.
- Stan, I don't know what's happening.
- Shoot her, Casey.
- Don't shoot her, Casey. - Shoot her, Casey.
She's fucking one of them, man!
There's nowhere to go.
Nowhere to hide.
We're everywhere.
I'll fucking shoot her.
Shit!
Jesus!
Get her!
She's getting away!
- Hurry!
- Shit!
I should have known that crazy bitch was one of them.
We can get her back, Zeke.
We can get them all back.
She destroyed most of my supply.
Look, if we kill the queen, we can get them all back.
Fuck!
- How much do we have left?
- Not much.
But we only need enough to get the queen.
- We get her, we get them all, right?
- I think so.
- Where are we gonna find her?
- Friday night? Only one place she can be.
Go Hornets!
He crosses the field!
Eludes the tacklers!
Tackled by four Hornets with authority.
Somebody stung by the Hornets!
Come on, ladies!
Let's play four quarters!
Jesus.
Get in there and take his fucking head off.
Kill! Kill!
Kill!
- You think it's Principal Drake?
- Who else?
She's in charge.
It would make perfect sense.
They're getting everybody.
I mean, the whole town is here.
By morning, there won't be a human left.
Come on.
Where are you guys?
We found Drake.
She's at the game.
What are you kids doing in here?
The gym is closed.
All of you come with me.
We can't do that,
Miss Drake.
Why is that?
Get her.
Quick, Zeke, get the doors!
Get me out!
You're all expelled!
- Stop the act. No one's buying it.
- We know who you are.
You're in a lot of trouble.
What are you doing?
- You ready?
- Yep.
Sniff this.
- No.
- Sniff it or he shoots you.
I will not.
Now what?
We do it the hard way.
With Mr Furlong, we plunged it into his eye, and the reaction was instantaneous.
You stick her, and then I'll shoot her before it erupts all over the place.
Casey, are you on drugs?
- What's wrong?
- Are we sure?
Please don't, Casey!
Don't wuss out, Casey!
Just do it!
What if we were wrong?
Stab it and find out.
I think we made a mistake, guys.
She's dead.
Easy!
Is that it?
Let's see if it worked.
It better have worked, or there are gonna be a lot of infected people going home.
We're right at ground zero.
You guys stay here.
I'll go check it out.
I'm gonna need some scat.
Use it wisely, man.
What if it wasn't Drake?
Then we're fucked.
I just don't want to never have done that.
What are you looking at?
Coach.
Jesus, I wish I'd never come here.
I don't like this place.
Any sign of him?
I can't tell.
I can barely see anything.
Quick, Stokely, open the door.
No, Stokely! We don't know if it's still him.
No, it's me.
Listen, it wasn't Drake.
It's the coach, and he's right after me. Open the door.
Don't do it, Stoke.
Prove it, Stan. Where's the drug?
I lost it. The coach was too fast for me.
Please, Stokely, don't leave me out here.
- Last one, man. - Please, I'm begging you!
Don't leave me out here!
- Come on, Stokely. Open the door.
- There, try it.
Okay, I'll do it. I'll...
Just let me do it inside.
Do it right now, man.
- Take the test, man.
- Stan, take the drug, man. Prove it to us.
Okay.
Fuck!
Fuck!
Open the door.
It is so much better.
There's no fear... or pain.
It's beautiful.
And you will be beautiful.
You'll be beautiful.
No problems or worries.
We want you.
I want you.
I want you.
Now open the fucking door!
- Open the door!
- Come away.
Go a-fucking-way, Stan!
It's too late, Stokely.
We've already won.
No pain, Stan?
Well, come in here, and I'll show you some fucking pain!
I say we go for the coach.
He turned Stan.
He's the one.
Would you rather wait for them to come to us?
Either way, we're completely unarmed.
Maybe not. I might have some more scat.
Where?
- In my trunk.
- In your trunk.
In your car, amongst the aliens.
That's convenient.
You got a better idea?
Stan?
You out there, buddy?
Does it really take two of us to get to your car?
Nope. One of us is a decoy.
Get him!
Where did he go?
- Check over there.
- Come on! Find him!
Hello, Casey.
Where are you gonna go?
Class wuss.
Eternal little loser... who comes to school every day knowing that this is it.
You've been labelled pathetic... since first grade, and you're afraid it's gonna bleed over for the rest of your life.
But we can stop it, Casey.
We can help you belong.
Isn't that what you really want?
Please don't do this,
Delilah.
I haven't been this happy since probably... since before my dad died.
You know you want me, Casey.
Come on.
Let's do it together.
Hello, Miss Burke.
Hello, sweetie pie.
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing important.
So, I take it you changed your mind about the chocolate laxatives?
Actually, I had my heart set on something cherry-flavoured. You know what I mean?
Sorry, I'm all out of those.
I might have something else for you though.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Something tasty?
- Let me hook you up.
Hello, Zekey boy.
You're too tense, honey.
Relax.
Fuck this.
I'm outta here.
I always thought the only alien in this high school was me.
Not the case.
Who do you think it is, the master alien, the queen bee?
It could be anyone.
What happens at the end of these stories, Stokely?
How does Invasion of the
Body Snatchers turn out?
They get us.
They win. We lose.
Do we?
Maybe we really win.
Stan didn't look unhappy.
That's 'cause it wasn't Stan.
They took away who he was.
Maybe they just bettered who he was, cleared away his confusion.
I know you pride yourself on being the outsider, Stokely, but aren't you tired of being something you're not?
I know I am.
No fucking way!
Shit!
Run, Stokes!
Stokes!
Stokely!
Stokes! Stokes!
Stokely!
No!
Stokely!
Come on, Stokes.
Run!
Come on!
- Hello?
- Zeke, I'm over here.
Watch out.
It's her.
- Zeke, don't believe her. It's her.
- She attacked me. Please, Zeke.
- What's going on here, Marybeth?
- Please, it is her.
She's lying.
She's trying to fake you out.
We don't know what she is: gay, straight, alien.
Answer me something,
Marybeth:
Why are you naked?
Does it bother you,
Zeke? My body?
- I'm getting kind of used to it myself.
- But I saw you take the test.
Zeke, how the hell can you be sure what you saw?
It was sweet of you to bond with me.
To be nice to me was sweet.
Will it work again, baby?
Do you like what you see?
Zeke.
- Take this.
- Now, Marybeth.
- You sniff it.
- You're out of your fucking mind.
I'm not taking any chances. I leave for five minutes, and everyone's an alien.
Now if I have to Men In Black your ass, you're gonna fucking sniff it.
Happy now?
Jesus. I'm fucking seeing two of everything.
Zeke. Zeke!
Come on, buddy.
Get up.
He's over here.
Casey, come out, come out, wherever you are.
You know, in my world, Casey, there were limitless oceans as far as the eye could see.
A beautiful home until it started to dry up.
So I escaped, came here and met you.
All of you.
All of you were different from the others.
Thanks, pal.
You were lost and lonely, just like me.
And I thought that maybe
I could give you a taste of my world: a world without anger, without fear, without attitude.
Where the underachiever goes home at night to parents who care.
The jock can be smart, the ugly duckling beautiful, and the class wuss doesn't have to live in terror.
And the new girl... Well, she can just fit right in with people who are just like her.
You see, Casey, even Marybeth's feelings can be hurt... by a bunch of pathetic, lost, little outcasts... who truly believe that their disaffected lonely life... is the only way they can survive.
I can make you a part of something so special, Casey, so perfect, so fearless.
Don't you want that, Casey?
I'd rather be afraid.
Fine. All right.
Have it your way.
'Cause this is where your land of fiction gets it right.
We win.
End of story.
Guaranteed to jack you up.
You wouldn't have liked it here anyway.
Stokes. Stokes.
Are you... you?
I think so.
I hope so.
Fuck!
- Shit!
- Is it over?
Yeah.
All right, you little fuck-pukes, quit screwing around!
As you can see, life has returned to normal at Herrington High... after the mysterious disappearance of several faculty members one month ago.
Both the local authorities and the F.B.I. have largely discounted... several students' claim that an extraterrestrial was involved.
A spokesperson for the F.B.I. has indicated... that no substantiating evidence has been found.
That goes for you too, Zeke!
Just 'cause you're the new guy doesn't mean we're gonna cut you any slack!
Put that butt out and get in there!
Now bring that camera over here.
When do you think they're gonna find a new story?
Haven't they milked our little high school invasion to death?
Although there has been no evidence of foul play, the criminal investigation is ongoing.
No regrets?
None whatsoever.
So, how does it feel to be a hero?
It's all right, I guess.
I don't know, it's...
- different.
- That's him over there. Hey, Casey.
Your fan club's here again.
Network or local?
Both.
You know, you can be pretty cool sometimes.
Things sure have changed, haven't they?
