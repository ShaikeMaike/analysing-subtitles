I'm happy as can be
Let's go walkin', you and me
Ready, set

Over the hill
Across the field
Through the tunnel we'll go
We'll run across the bridge
And down the bumpy gravel road
Right beneath the spider's web
Ready, set

Hey, let's go
Hey, let's go
I'm happy as can be
Let's go walkin', you and me

The deep and wonderful woods all day
Look at all my many friends

Look at all my many friends
Ready, set
Let's

Thanks.
Daddy, want any caramel candy?
Thank you. I would. Anybody tired yet?
Mm-mmm.
We're almost there.
Good.
Ohh!
Mai, hide.
I thought he was a policeman.
Hi!
Hi!
Hello there!
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
Sorry to bother you, but are your parents around anywhere?
They're out there in the field.
Thanks a lot.
Hello there!
Looks like we're going to be neighbors!
Pleasure to meet you.
Good luck in the new house!
Thank you! See you soon!
Oh!
Thank you very much.
Everybody out.
Uhh! Ohh!
Hey!
Hang on.
There.
Hey, Mai, come over here a minute.
Wow!
What are those little things swimming around?
l don't know.
Goldfish maybe or something?
So do you like it?
It's terrific!
Uh-huh.
Come on, Mai, run!
Wait up!
Wow!
- Can we?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh!
Ha ha ha!
You be careful, O. K.?
Oh, sure. Hee hee hee!
Ha ha ha!
- Oh!
- Oh!
Ohh!
What a lot of neat old junk.
Do you think it's haunted?
Ohh, maybe it is.
Oh, boy!
I bet I can beat you around the house!
Wait!
[Imitating airplane]
Ooh! Oh!
Ooh.
Ohh!
It's completely rotten.
Uh-oh, it's gonna fall down
- Ha ha ha!
- Hee hee!
Uhh! Uhh!
Oh! Hee hee!
Ooh!
Oh!
Hee hee! Aah!
Ha ha ha!
Hee hee hee!
Ha ha ha!
[Indian war whoops]
Hey!
Ohh! Whee!
Whoo! Ha ha!
Ha ha ha! Ohh!
Wow, Mai, look up!
What?
Up there. Look.
Wow, what a tree.
It's giant!
That's got to be the biggest tree in -
Ah-choo!
Ha ha ha!
Daddy, look at that big tree on the mountain!
That s a camphor tree.
Camphor.
Camphor tree!
Camphor tree!
Camphor!
Oh.
Uhh! Oh!
Hey, Mai. . .
Look, an acorn.
Huh?
But I want a acorn, too.
Oh, hey, wait a second.
There's some more over there.
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!
I have my own acorn right here.
Huh?
Mai, how am I supposed to open the house up
if you're in the way?
Acorns!
I found a bunch near the back door.
They came from way up.
They came out of the ceiling.
Hmm. Some squirrels must have dropped them.
- Ohh! Squirrels!
- Ohh! Squirrels!
Or maybe some other animal, perhaps a rat.
But I don't want a dumb rat!
Where am I going to put it?
Just bring it here.
I'll open it up for you.
Satsuki, open the kitchen door.
Here you go.
Mai, come on.
Hey!
[Imitating airplane]
Wait!
Hey, wait up!
You can't catch me
Can, too.
[Whoosh] hh!
Oh.
- Aah!
- Aah!
Hmm.
Ready?
Mm-hmm.
Bathtubs.
Great.
Nothing up there.
No.
- Ohh!
- Ohh!
Bathtubs are in there.
We saw something move in there.
A squirrel?
We're not sure.
Maybe they were cockroaches, but there were millions of them.
Hmm.
Lots of little black things.
See anything?
Well, I'm pretty sure they were dust bunnies.
Real dust bunnies, like in my picture book?
Dust bunnies make more sense than ghosts.
Why?
Uhh!
Ghosts are harder to see.
When you suddenly move from a lighted room to darkness,
you can't see for a second.
That's when dust bunnies come out.
Boy. Yeah.
Come out! Come out!
- Come out!
- Come on out!
Come out! Come out!
Come out! Come out!
Come out, dust bunnies!
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
Let's get to work.
We have to find the steps that lead up to the attic.
What?
Find the way up.
We'll open all the windows upstairs.
Yeah!
Hey, wait for me.
Ha ha.
No stairs.
No.
Nothing here.
Nothing here.
Nope. Nothing there.
Ha ha ha!
Nothing there.
Hee hee hee!
Ow.
Nobody in this room.
Nobody here!
- Hi!
- Ha ha ha!
Hey!
Ha ha ha!
Ohh!
Come here, Mai! I found it!
Hee hee hee!
Wow.
Someone up there?
Catch some ghosts upstairs?
- Ohh!
- Ohh!
It's an acorn.
Uh-oh.
Uhh!
They must like them.
Little dust bunnies, go away right now!
Oh.
Heh heh heh.
Hmm.
- Aah!
- Aah!
Aah.
Don't be scared, Mai.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
There's nobody here.
[Whoosh]
- Ohh!
- Ohh!
Aah!
Oh.
[Whoosh]
Ohh!
There.
That's it. Easy.
Slowly.
Guess what.
Something's really living upstairs after all!
That's wonderful. Good for you.
I've always wanted to have a haunted house.
It's been my lifelong dream.
Uhh!
Careful!
Oh!
[Crash]
Ooh!
Aah!
[Whoosh]
Guess what, Sis! I got one!
Uhh!
Eh?
Aah!
Mai?
Oh.
Aah!
Huh!
Whoo whoo!
Ah! Ah! Ah.
Two fine kids.
There's nothing to be frightened about.
Nanny has the farm next door.
She's helping us out.
Nanny, this is Mai, my sister,
and I'm Satsuki.
Very pleased to meet both of you.
lf I'd known what a hurry you were in to move,
I would've cleaned the house up.
It really isn't necessary.
Aah!
I've been so busy in the rice paddies lately. . .
How did you get all that black on you?
I had a dust bunny right in my hand.
Ohh! Mai, your feet!
Uh-oh.
To do a little dusting. . .
You got mine black, too!
Eh?
Aha!
It appears the soot sprites are hard at work.
What are they?
You mean those black little fuzzy things that fly around and disappear upstairs?
Yes. They breed in very old empty houses, building invisible nests and turning everything into dust.
l could see them, too, when I was a very small child.
That you two are able to see them makes me very glad.
It couldn't have been a spirit, could it?
If they're not sprites, then you have nothing to be frightened about. lf we keep smiling, the sprites may gradually go away and leave this place alone.
Yes. I'm sure that somewhere up in that ceiling they're busily discussing plans for leaving the house.
[Chattering]
Maybe they really will leave us alone.
What's wrong with them?
With dust bunnies all over the house?
I'm not afraid of dust bunnies.
Maybe you can go to the bathroom by yourself at night.
Ha ha ha!
Come. The house needs cleaning up.
Fetch a bucket and go get some water.
From the stream?
Maybe we'll catch a fish!
- Ha ha ha!
- Hee hee hee!
You wait here, O. K.?
Did you get any fish?
Ha ha!
It's coming out!
It's coming out, Nanny!
Good. Very good.
Just keep at it till the water gets cold.
Right.
Ha!
Ha!
Oh.
Huh!
Hey, is that for us?
Is that for me?
Tell me what your name is.
Uh, it's for Grandma.
Huh?
Grandma?
Yuh-uh-uh.
Hmm?
Mmm!
Yuh-uh!
Hey, wait up! Where you going?
Kanta, don't be silly.
Hey, haven't you heard?
You re living in a haunted house!
- Ohh!
- Go away!
Yuh-uh!
[Sniffs]
Ehhhh!
Ha ha ha! l remember doing that when I was his age. l hate boys, but I love Nanny's food better than anything else in the whole wide world.
Eat all you want.
Thanks for your help!
Bye!
Thank you so much, Nanny.
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!
[Wind howling]
Aah! Oh!
[Wind howling]
I'm scared the wind's going to make the house fall down.
Maybe it will, but I hope not because we just moved in.
Huh?
[Crash]
- Hmm?
- Ohh!
Aah!
- Ha ha ha!
- Ohh!
Come on. What are you waiting for?
You have to laugh loud to scare a spirit.
Ha ha ha!
I'm not scared at all.
Uh huh ha ha.
I'm not! I mean it!
Aah! Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
Aah!
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
That's it. Give it all you got.
Come on. Yeah.
There we go.
Well, if I may humbly say so, we're finished.
- Yay!
- Yay!
Uhh! There we are.
Get ready to fly, Mai!
Better hold on!
- Aah!
- Oh! Oh! Oh!
Here we go!
Nanny!
Hi!
Hello!
Where are you pedaling off to this morning?
We're going to visit Mommy in the hospital!
Well, be sure to give my regards!
I know she'll be very happy to see you!
Bye-bye.
Ehhhh!
Ehhhh!
Nyehhh!
That way, Daddy! That way!
- Ooh. Oh, oh.
- Ha ha ha!
Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
- Ohh!
Hee hee hee!
Mommy!
My love, I'm so happy to see you.
Daddy took the wrong road.
We had to come another way.
Well. Don't be shy.
We got off today from school.
Wonderful.
Daddy said to tell you he'll be here.
He's probably speaking to the doctor.
It's good to see you all.
Do you like the new house?
Yeah.
Ohh! You mean they live upstairs?
Mm-hmm.
Do you like fuzzy spirits, Mommy?
Yes. I wish I could go see them now.
You were right, Mai.
Mm-hmm.
We thought you might not be happy about the house having spooks.
Are you happy with them?
Yep.
I'm not afraid of them.
Don't tell me you fixed Mai's ponytails by yourself.
Mm-hmm.
They're beautiful.
You know, you're a very lucky girl.
She always gets mad at me.
That's because you re always jumping around.
Satsuki, come here.
Why don't you let me brush your hair?
I'm glad it's short.
I want mine short.
When you re my age.
Satsuki, you have wire for hair, as stubborn as mine when I was small.
I'll be able to have hair as beautiful as yours
when I'm older, right?
Yes. I know that because you look exactly like me when I was young.
Hi.
Da da da-da da da
Da da da-duh
Da da da-da da da da-da
Da da-duh. . .
I thought Mommy looked a lot better. l think the doctor might let her leave shortly.
Does that mean tomorrow, Daddy?
Aw, tomorrow means tomorrow.
Maybe not tomorrow, but it's pretty soon.
She said when she comes, she'll only sleep in my bed.
You said you were big enough to sleep by yourself.
Mommy told me it would be O. K.
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
Da da da-duh
La la la la
Daddy!
Daddy, wake up!
It's morning!
Ohh.
Daddy, get up.
Uhh!
It's Mai!
Hee hee hee!
Good morning.
I must have overslept.
We get our lunch boxes today.
I'm sorry. I completely forgot.
I made lunch for everybody.
Hey, it's burning.
Just a minute!
O. K. , this one's for you.
That one's mine.
Mai, stop that. Sit down and eat.
Go ahead. Wrap it yourself.
[Sniffing]
Ahh.
Hey!
You're late!
Must be time to go.
O. K.!
l can't believe you've made a friend already.
Bet you sit next to her in class.
Yep, and her name's Michiko.
Ahh.
Here I come!
- Thanks for saying goodbye!
- Thanks for saying goodbye!
Hi. Sorry.
Why'd you take so long?
We're going to be late.
Ahh. . .
Uhmmm!
Daddy, this hat!
Am I a grownup if I wear it?
It looks that way.
Where are you going?
Going to get some flowers.
Is it lunchtime yet?
I don't think so!
Hmm.
Daddy, look. I'm the flower lady.
Heh heh heh.
Golly, wollypogs.
Hmm.
[Gasp]
There's no bottom.
Huh?
Wow.
Acorn.
Dust bunnies.
Hey.
Huh?
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Come back!
Aha!
Hmm?
Aah!
[Snore]
[Snore]
Hey.
Ah-choo!
Ha!
Hmm?
Hmm.
Tell me who you are.
Are you a big dust bunny?
No.
I'm. . .
[Rahhr]
Waah!
[Giggles]
To. . .
To. . .
Ro!
Totoro?
That's it.
I bet your name's Totoro, isn't it?
[Soft grunt]
So you're really a Totoro.
[Soft grunt]
Totoro.
Sure, I will. Tomorrow.
- O. K. Bye.
- See you later.
Daddy, I'm home.
Already?
Wait. How come you're home so late?
I was playing with Michiko.
Where's Mai?
l haven't even eaten lunch.
I think Mai's out back.
Mai!
Mai!
Mai?
Mai?
Daddy, over here!
I think I know where Mai went.
[Gasp]
Mai?
Mai!
Wake up!
Wake up.
[Moaning]
Wake up, Mai! Right now!
You have no business sleeping in this place.
How come he's gone?
How come who's gone?
Tell me who you lost.
A big Totoro was here with me.
A big one like what's in our picture books?
Mm-hmm.
And I climbed up on top of him,
and he was furry, and he had a big mouth, and there was a little one and one this big and a great big one sleeping by himself.
Uh-huh?
Hello! Is anybody in there?
Well, I'll be.
What a great hiding place.
Daddy, Mai told me she saw a big Totoro.
A real one?
Mm-hmm.
This way.
Ha ha!
Hey, give me a chance.
Here?
Mmm. Mm-hmm.
He was by the big tree a little while ago.
I don't see how he could've escaped.
Mai! Mai, come back!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!
Stop laughing!
I really saw him. I m not lying.
I'm not lying.
Mai.
You don't believe me.
Mm-hmm. That's where you're wrong.
l believe you're being completely truthful about this.
But I also believe that you met the king of the forest.
Meeting him is a sign of good luck.
There's no guarantee you'll see him all the time.
We'll have to pay our respects.
Where do we find him?
Miss Mai will find him for us.
Oh!
Ohh, Mai, you're getting heavier by the minute.
Daddy, the camphor tree.
What a beautiful tree.
I found it.
You sure that's the one?
Uh-huh.
What are you waiting for, Daddy?
Hurry up.
The hole's not there anymore, but I'm sure this is where it was.
You're positive it is?
Mm-hmm.
The opening's completely disappeared.
Remember, you can see him only when he wants you to.
Will we see him? I want to meet him.
You never can tell.
If we're lucky enough.
What a beautiful tree it is.
This tree's been here, well, since before anyone can remember.
You know, a long time ago,
Man and trees were the best of friends.
It's actually because of this tree that I decided to buy our house,
and Mommy will like it, too.
Let's thank the king of the forest and get back for lunch.
I have to meet Michiko after lunch.
I'm coming, too.
Attention!
Thank you for all you've done for Mai.
Please protect her forever.
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.
Last one home's a rotten egg.
No fair! You cheated!
Wait!
Hey!
Hey, wait up!
"Dear Mother,
You're never going to believe this,
but today, under that giant tree,
Mai actually met a ghost, Totoro.
Daddy says it was the king of the forest.
Well, whoever he was,
I really want to meet him."
[Chickens clucking]
[Cluck cluck]
Kanta, you'd better hurry up, or you'll be late.
O. K.
[Whispering]
[Giggling]
There.
Huh?
Mai? What. . .
Excuse me.
Yes, Satsuki?
I-i-it's my sister Mai.
What's she going to do?
Nanny! Nanny, what happened?
Dear, I'm sorry, but she demanded to be with her sister.
But I'm going to be -
Mai, you promised to be a good girl
because Daddy's at the university and can't take care of you.
l have a couple hours left before I can come home, and Nanny's been very nice to watch you.
Our Mai has been a very good girl.
Eh?
Well, I better ask permission for her to come inside.
Because her mother's going to be in the hospital,
Satsuki will be taking care of her sister Mai.
Is that clear?
Yes, ma'am.
What's that a picture of, Mai?
A Totoro picture.
Shh!
Could you be a little more quiet about it?
[Bell rings]
Bye-bye.
Want to come over and play?
I might miss the club meeting.
Come whenever you can.
Bye, Mai.
Goodbye.
We'd better walk fast, or we're going to get wet.
O. K.
Oh, no! Hurry!
Oh!
Oh, my god.
Are you O. K.?
Yeah.
Come on.
Wow. What do we do now?
lf it's not too much trouble, could we stay until it stops raining?
Uh. . .
Thanks.
Uh. . .
Ha ha.
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!
We were pretty lucky, huh?
Ha ha! That's funny.
It's got holes in it.
Uh-oh. Daddy left his umbrella.
Hey, we could bring it back to him.
I just forgot because I forgot.
How can you forget your umbrella
when it's raining?
Even you can't be that stupid.
You probably broke it in half.
I did not!
Hmm?
Y-y-yii!
[Crash]
Excuse me. Is anybody home?
Satsuki, what are you doing here?
Grandma.
Thank you for taking care of Mai.
Don't be ridiculous.
She was a treasure.
We wanted to bring back the umbrella we borrowed.
But - Kanta's umbrella?
Why would he give you this beat-up thing?
We didn't have one, but I'm afraid he got soaking wet.
Anyway, please thank him for us.
l will.
I'm always telling him to wash, so rain did him no harm.
Are you on your way to meet your father?
Yes, ma'am.
Give him my regards.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.
Hee hee hee!
[Imitating airplane]
Did someone come to the door?
I didn't hear anything.
Oh, boy, we made it!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Getting onboard or not?
All right, let's go.
Daddy wasn't on that one, right?
I'm sure he'll be on the next one.
Want to go back to Nanny's house and wait?
[Water dripping]
What's the matter?
Mai, you re sleepy.
Uh-uh.
I told you it might be a while.
You don't want to go to Nanny's and wait?
I'm sure the bus will come soon.
Just hang in there.
Well, I guess they were delayed, but I hope not.
Come on.
[Footsteps]
[Gasp]
Uhhh. . .
I bet you re Totoro.
[Soft grunt]
[Giggles]
Oh, we have another umbrella if you want.
Go ahead. Take it.
Come on. I'm going to drop Mai.
You put it over your head like that.
[Giggling]
[Splat]
[Splat]
[Splat]
[Splash]
[Rahhr]
Aah!
[Rahhr]
Huh?
Huh?
The bus is here.
[Mmreowwr]
- Oh!
- Oh!
[Rahrr]
Mai, wa-wasn't that umbrella he took with him Daddy's?
Thank you.
How nice of you to meet me.
Daddy!
I'm sorry, but the train was late.
That's why I missed the first bus.
You weren't worried, were you? l saw him!
He was right beside me!
Me, too!
Uh. . . uh. . .
Oh, and gigantic arms.
Great big eyeballs, too.
It was scary.
I was scared.
We saw Totoro! We saw Totoro!
We saw Totoro
[Raaar]
[Frogs croaking]
Hey, anyone want a ride?
I do!
O. K. , here we go!
Whee!
"Dear Mother, I'm surprised
I can write to you at all
 'cause my heart is still beating so fast,
Mai and I had something incredible happen today.
We both met Totoro,
I really saw him.
He even gave us a gift.
It was a package wrapped up in bamboo leaves
and tied with dragon whiskers.
We opened it immediately.
Guess what was in it!
Magic nuts and seeds."
- Oh!
- Oh!
Ha ha ha.
"We've decided to plant them all out in the front
because someday they'll be tall and beautiful.
Mai just. . .
sits there every day waiting for them to sprout,
but they don't seem to want to grow.
l can't wait to see what they'll be like.
Mai sends her love and wanted to make sure
you saw her drawing."
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
"It's going to be summer vacation soon,
and we'll be out of school.
l love you, Mother.
Please get well soon."
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
Come on, get off.
That's it! I said get off!
Come on, it's bedtime.
Daddy, will the plants come out?
I mean will they come out tomorrow?
That's tough to say.
Perhaps Totoro will be able to say if they will.
Good night.
Wake up, Mai.
But isn't that where we planted -
Mm-hmm.
Oh! Ow!
Ha ha ha ha!
[Soft grunt]
It worked!
[Loud grunt]
Ah. . .
Ah!
Ah!
Ah! Ah!
Ooh!
Yay!
Yay! We did it!
Yay!
Hee hee!
[Whirring]
Ah. . .
Yay!
Ah!
Ya!
[Rahhrr]
- Aah!
- Aah!
- Aah!
- Aah!
- Aah!
- Now we know what makes the wind blow!
Hmm.
[Whistling]
Huh?
Ha ha ha.
[Tooting]
[Gasp]
What happened to the tree?
[Gasp]
Hey!
We did it! We did it!
Yay!
It was only a dream.
It wasn't a dream.
It was only a dream.
It wasn't a dream!
It was only a dream!
We did it!
We did it!
Telegram!
Hello!
Telegram!
Hello! Anyone home?
Hmm.
Maybe not.
Nanny!
Ha ha ha!
Over here, Mai.
That one's perfect.
Ahh. . .
Hey!
About how ripe is this?
That's ripe.
Wow.
Your vegetable garden is more like a mountain of treasure.
Thanks to Mother Nature.
Let's take a little rest, shall we?
There we are, nice and cold.
Michiko will be jealous.
Mmm.
It's amazing.
They've absorbed lots of wonderful things from the sun.
That's what makes them so good for the body and the soul.
Would they help my mother?
Of course they would.
My vegetable garden is bound to make anyone feel better.
Our mother s coming home this week from the hospital.
She'll sleep with me under my cover.
That's wonderful.
She s able to come back, is she?
She's coming home to spend a couple of days but has to go right back there.
I suppose she has to be careful.
Yes, she has.
We'll fatten her up on my fresh vegetables.
I'm giving Mommy this corn
I picked for her specially.
I'm sure she'll love you for it.
Mm-hmm.
Mailman gave me this telegram because you were out. Here.
But Daddy won't be home from the university till after 9 :OO.
Open it now then.
A telegram is serious business.
Mm-hmm.
It's from my mother's doctor at the hospital.
"Please contact me."
What's that supposed to mean?
Is something wrong or not? l know something awful s happened to her.
What am I supposed to do if my father s not home?
Have you any way of telephoning your father?
I have the number of his research lab, but we don't have a telephone.
Take them to your mother's place.
Let them use the phone.
Do you understand?
Don t panic, but go quickly.
Mai, you make sure you stay put at my house!
Mai!
Mai!
Hey, Mai, don't follow me!
Go to Nanny's house.
Oh.
Hello, Operator.
I'd like to make a long-distance call, please.
It's very important.
It's number 1354 at Station 12.
Yes.
Thank you very much.
Your friend is very pretty.
What lovely hair.
[Ring]
Hello.
Yes.
Can you put me through to the Main lecture room of the Anthropology School?
To Professor Kusakabe.
Please hurry.
Yes, yes.
I'm his daughter.
It was from the hospital, Daddy.
I'm so worried.
Whoa, whoa. Slow down.
From the hospital?
Oh, O. K. It's all right.
I think I understand.
Now, I'm going to call the hospital.
What's happened to Mommy?
There's no need to worry.
I'll check with the hospital and call you right back, O. K.?
Uh-huh.
Stay where you are.
I'm hanging up, so you stay right there.
He'll be calling back.
So is it all right if I stay here by the telephone and wait?
You take all the time you need.
Hey, where are you?
Uh-oh.
[Baa]
[Baa]
Oh, no!
I'm giving this to my Mommy!
[Baa]
Go away!
You just better stop it right now!
[Baa]
Mai, the hospital said that Mommy's condition isn't very good, so she won't be coming home just yet.
But why?
Mai, what can we do?
lf she came home now, it'd make it worse.
It would not!
But she'll be able to come home real soon.
No!
All right then! Be that way!
Let's see if she dies!
No!
Don't be dumb, Mai!
Oh, I give up!
You're so stupid!
Come on, Mai.
Waah!
I'm not stupid!
Waah!
I took care of the rest of the washing.
Come on, now.
It isn't the end of the world.
Your old Nanny's here to help.
Let's see that beautiful smile.
Your father's stopping off at the hospital
on his way home, eh?
What I heard was that your mother only caught a small cold.
She'll be home next weekend,
I believe.
That s what they said last time, too.
"It'll be a little visit,
just a few days to see what's wrong with her.
It's just a cold."
What are me and Mai going to do if Mommy dies?
Uh, uh. . .
What are we going to do, Nanny?
There, there.
Don't worry.
Your mother's not going to die.
Hush.
She'd never leave two such beautiful children.
She loves you too much for that.
Don't cry.
Nanny will stay with you until your father comes home.
Mai!
Where are you?
Mai!
[Cicada chirping]
Mai, come back!
Did you see her anywhere?
No sign at all.
She wasn't at the bus stop?
That's very strange.
Where could she possibly have gone?
Maybe she's angry about this morning.
We had a bad argument and - maybe she went to visit Mommy in the hospital!
The hospital's so far from here.
It's - oh, my heavens!
It would take a grown man three hours to get there.
Hey!
Oh, my goodness.
Please, you must get your father right now.
Tell him little Mai has disappeared.
[Panting]
How could you do something so stupid, Mai?
You always get lost.
Mai!
I'm sorry to bother you, but you haven't seen a little girl, have you?
She's my sister, about 5 years old.
Well, seems to me I remember someone.
Yes, near as I can recall, she went that way.
Maybe she went through the forest.
Then again, she might've gone in the other direction.
Are you sure it was your sister?
All sorts of folks come by here, but I don't see them.
Mai, I'm scared.
Thank you!
Mai!
Please stop!
Aah!
Hey, are you crazy, kid?
I'm looking for my sister.
Have you seen a little girl wandering around?
I'm afraid not.
Mai's her name, and she's 5 years old.
She probably got lost.
We haven't seen anyone, have we?
l think she's going to
Shichikoku Yama.
We just came from there,
but we haven't come across anybody.
Well, thank you.
By the way, where are you from?
Matsugo.
You walked from there to here?
That s three hours away.
Well, good luck, kid.
I hope you find her!
Satsuki, wait!
Come here!
Kanta!
We haven't found her yet.
How about you?
Nothing.
My dad's got everyone searching for her,
so you go home,
and I'll bike to Shichikoku Yama, O. K.?
I'm afraid if she visits Mommy's hospital,
she'll completely lose her -
Somebody found some sandals by the lake.
There's no way she could get past all those people without somebody noticing.
Oh!
Hey, don't worry!
Nobody said they were Mai's sandals!
Did you find her yet?
[Praying]
Go back a bit over towards your right!
Hey, you have any poles left?
There's Satsuki.
Eh?
Look.
Mai!
Mai!
Look, Satsuki.
Is it hers?
It's not hers.
What?
Ohh. . .
Merciful heavens.
You know, Satsuki,
for a while
I thought it might be Mai's.
Mom, I told you you jumped to conclusions.
Forget it! It isn't hers!
So, what do we do now?
We keep on looking, that's what.
Whatever you do, you better hurry up.
It'll be dark soon.
I am grateful to you all.
If you could keep searching -
Don't worry. We understand.
Don't you think we should call the police?
Well, I don't know.
Do you think the police could -
Where are you going?
Totoro,
I beg you, please protect Mai.
She ll be lost and probably scared.
I'll be good for the rest of my life
If I can just see her again.
Oh!
Aah!
What?
Totoro!
Totoro, Mai's lost somewhere.
l looked and looked, but I can't find her anywhere!
Oh, please.
You have to help me find her.
She's probably alone somewhere crying and upset.
Oh, Totoro, I'm scared.
[Soft grunt]
[Rahhr]
[Rahhr]
What?
[Mmreowr]
He wouldn't be able to.
But how come nobody sees the bus?
Oh. . .
Ha ha ha ha!
Oh!
Next stop,
Little Sister.
[Mmreowr]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Mai, where are you?
But how does he make it do that?
[Barking]
Ohh. . .
Mai!
But, Sis, where are you?
Satsuki!
Mai!
There you are!
Satsuki!
Ha ha ha!
Oh, Mai.
I'm sorry.
Tell me one thing.
Were you bringing that corn to the hospital?
Mm-hmm.
[Mmreowr]
[Gasp]
Next stop,
Shichikoku Yama Hospital.
You mean we can go to Mom's hospital?
[Meow]
You're wonderful!
I'm sorry.
It was all because of my silly cold that the hospital sent that telegram.
The grief it must've caused all of you.
I hope you can forgive me.
It was simply a bureaucratic mistake.
I'm sure it wasn't terribly traumatic for either of the girls.
It just means you'll be home next weekend.
They understand.
l wouldn't be at all surprised if they suffered more than we know,
in particular Satsuki because she's so smart and sensitive.
Hmm, could be right.
You'd better be careful after I get home because I intend to spoil them rotten.
Oh, no!
Look. Mommy's laughing.
She seems pretty healthy to me.
Yep.
Oh, I can't wait to get up on my feet again.
Neither can we.
Oh.
Hmm.
Now, that's weird.
Oh!
What happened?
Well, I'm not sure, but I could've sworn l saw both girls in the treetop laughing.
That might not be as crazy as you think.
"For Mother. . ."
"For Mother. . ."
Totoro
Totoro
Totoro
Totoro
Who leaves the seeds
For you to find?
Follow them
And you will see
A treasure there
Then plant the seeds
And help them grow
It may seem like a dream
But things are not what they seem
Now begins a new adventure
For you
And you'll be with Totoro
Totoro
Totoro
Totoro
Living in the forest trees
For such a very, very long time
There you'll be with Totoro
Totoro
Totoro
Totoro
You only see him
When you're very young
A magical adventure for you
It's magic for you
Rain tumbles down
The bus is late
Suddenly
A furry wet giant
Is by your side
Don't be afraid
Just open wide
Your umbrella for him
Watch him play in the rain
Now begins a new adventure
For you
And you'll be with Totoro
Totoro
Totoro
Totoro
And on a moonlit night
He plays a magic flute in the sky
There you'll be with Totoro
Totoro
Totoro
Totoro
You only see him
When you're very young
A magical adventure for you
It's magic for you
THE END
Huh?
Th-that can't be!
Seriously?
Oops!
Huh?
Wow!
Yahoo!
This is amazing! Just like a dream!
Yahoo!
Help me!
Mom!
A train is coming to get me!
Mom! Mom!
So it was a dream.
Nemo, are you all right?
Was he having a bad dream again?
Don't tell me you sneaked a piece of pie again?
All right! lt's the circus parade! lcarus! Come here, lcarus!
Let's go!
We need to hurry or we'll miss it!
Excuse me! Oops. . .
Excuse me.
Awesome, look at that!
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen! The amazing circus has come to town!
The greatest show on Earth!
Ooopsie.
Yahoo!
Hello there, son.
Me?
Want a ride?
Of course! Thanks!
Well then, are you enjoying yourself? lt's perfect! Right, lcarus?
Ladies and gentlemen in the crowd,
Children too,
Buy your tickets to the greatest show on Earth as soon as you can!
You sure are an amusing little fellow.
Dad! Dad!
The circus is in town!
That's nice. . .
Please, take me there!
Please, Dad?
Let's go tomorrow, Nemo.
You always say "tomorrow".
Oh drat! l'm late for my meeting. l must leave.
Tomorrow, l promise. Tomorrow.
Have a nice day, darling.
Drat. . .
Good night.
Good night, darling.
"Remember your promise"
Nemo!
Where am l?
Listen, Nemo, how many times must l tell you?
What was l doing?
Nemo! Come back at once!
Nemo!
Darling, please have a talk with your son.
He won't listen to me one bit.
Tomorrow. . . l'll talk to him tomorrow. . .
That was a close call. lcarus. Wake up. lcarus!
Look sharp, boys!
The King is coming through!
Attention!
Aye!
Good evening.
Allow me to introduce myself.
Who are you? l am a professor and a genius.
You may call me Professor Genius.
And this is BonBon. l am his assistant!
What do you want with me?
We came here to see you on orders from
Morpheus, the King of Slumberland.
King Morpheus?
Slumberland? lndeed.
Ah, the gift from the Princess.
Wait until the explanations are through.
His Majesty, King Morpheus, ruler of Slumberland, and keeper of all good dreams.
Cordially invites little Nemo on behalf of his daughter, Princess Camille,
To be the royal playmate of Camille in Slumberland
Oh. . . thanks.
Princess Camille grows impatient, we must depart immediately.
W-wait a minute!
This princess is a girl, right? But l've never played with a girl before.
What?
She's not just a girl, she's a princess!
Same thing.
A girl is a girl.
And besides, l've never heard of Slumberland. lndifference over a royal invitation? Unheard of!
Then what about this present?
Present, you say?
Yes! lt is a present from the sweet Princess Camille!
Ooooh, l love presents!
These are delicious dream-sweets made in our special candy factory.
Woah, awesome!
Thanks! l like princesses after all. l like girls, too.
Yummy!
The King wishes you to ride on his private blimp.
A blimp? A real blimp?
Woah, look at that, lcarus! lt's real! And it looks just like my model!
Hi!
His Majesty has ordered your presence and is waiting for you. l'll come! l accept his invitation!
Right, lcarus? l'd better leave Mom a note.
Please hurry. We cannot delay the departure time.
Hurry, the princess is waiting.
Make haste, make haste, Nemo!
Okay!
Farewell, world. Preparations for ascent complete. lcarus, look! Those houses look like models!
This is amazing. We're getting higher and higher.
Well then, this place is. . .
The pilothouse! l know that.
Keep the present altitude and proceed at full speed!
Want to take the wheel, Nemo?
Can l?
Yes, you may. Grab 'hold tight.
Like this?
Yes, that's right.
Yes.
You're good, kid! Keep it up and you'll be an aeronaut someday.
Yahoo!
This feels like aero-acrobatics!
That's Nightmare! lt's Nightmare!
Oh no!
Emergency!
Grab it tight. Keep calm, Nemo.
Engines at full!
Don't worry. We've outrun Nightmare before.
Nightmare is gonna get us! lt's the Crystal Clouds!
Thank goodness. Once we enter those clouds, we will be safe.
Full speed ahead!
Hold on tight, Nemo.
A-are we safe now?
Yes, we are. All safe.
See? We're leaving through the clouds!
Lower the engines, prepare for descent.
Welcome to Slumberland!
So this is Slumberland?
They all know me?
Of course they do!
They all came here to welcome you!
Hello!
Hey, buddy, watch where you're going!
Move it!
Who's that?
Someone you should keep away from.
Hey, how's it goin', kid? Feelin' well?
Come play with me!
Leave that old geezer.
Old geezer, you say? lnsolent fool!
Well, see ya later!
Okay.
Hey, who was that, Professor? lt's Flip, the terrible.
Flip?
Please, son, don't speak that name in my presence again.
Little Nemo, to visit His Majesty!
Majesty,
As per your orders, l have brought this boy to you.
This is Nemo.
Your Majesty?
Ahh, of all the foolishness
Go search in the gardens! l'll search through the palace.
Hurry!
Make haste!
Yes, sir!
W-wait. . .
They're gone.
So you're the kid that was invited here?
What a lucky devil ya are.
You're Flip, aren't you.
Professor says you're "terrible."
S'ppose so. l'm terribly fun and terribly kind.
And l have the power to make your dreams come true.
So, ya wanna see the King, right?
Yes, l do.
Then let me handle that.
Do you really know where he is? l know everything, kid.
After all, l'm the only one here who has a correct map of the entire kingdom.
"Nightmare Land"?
Oh, Slumberland.
C'mon. Let's find the King.
Wait.
Don't worry. We'll probably find the King before the Professor does.
Hey, if that furball doesn't like it, leave 'em behind
No, he's okay. We're coming.
Wow!
Step this way.
Flip!
Everything's upside-down! lndeed it is.
Follow me.
Umph.
This takes a special technique. Watch closely.
Come. Show me what you've got.
Got'cha.
What's that?
Who could it be?
Something's loose. . . ls it this?
No, this one. . .
No, not that one either.
Then where is it wonky? lsn't it the piston gasket?
Ah, that it is. Wrench, please. . .
Wrench.
Screwdriver.
Piston gasket.
Put on the piston gasket and get it in tight. l think you should make it tighter for good measure.
Anything else?
Oil it up.
This is impressive! lt's all better.
You're a good little mechanic.
Guess so. l love trains.
So do l!
Hey, the train is leaving.
Oh, hurry to me!
Ouch.
Are we gonna follow it?
Of course. This way.
Follow me!
Hurry!
Where are we going?
Just hurry!
Oh, we made it just on time. lt's here!
All aboard!
You're the engineer.
Okay. Full speed!
Hey there, Moo-Moo, out of the way!
Train's coming through!
King Morpheus! King Morpheus!
What?
Move it, Professor! lt's been ages since l've had such fun.
Me too!
Ouch.
Your Majesty, l'd like to introduce you to-
We've already met.
"Your Majesty"?
You're the king??
Now, don't be so overly formal.
You can call me Morphy.
"Morphy"?
M-Morphy?
Oh, Morphy, this is my best friend, lcarus.
Well, what a cute little fellow you are.
Now then, Nemo, listen well. l invited you here so that you could become my heir.
Me?
Yes, you.
A prince always bears the mark of the heir. lt is this golden key.
This key has the ability to open any door in Slumberland.
Wow, thanks, Morphy!
However, l must warn you.
There is one door that you must not open. lt is the door that bears this symbol.
Solemnly swear to me, boy,
Promise that you will never open the door that bears this symbol.
Yes. l promise. l promise l won't open it.
Very well.
Now then, Professor, let's have my heir meet the Princess.
Yes, as you wish, your Majesty.
The Princess, eh?
The Rosebud Room. Princess Camellia's room.
The time has arrived.
Now then, let's get you looking your best.
Very good.
Sorry.
Come, Nemo. The Princess is waiting for you.
Listen, be on your best manners. Camellia is a Princess - don't ever forget that.
Princess, please pardon me.
May l please borrow your attention for just a moment?
This is Little Nemo.
"Little Nemo"?
Come.
Welcome.
So this boy is Nemo.
The present, Nemo.
You know, the cookies.
Oh, yeah.
Thank you, er, l mean, for the cookies, Princess Camellia.
You're welcome. l'm glad you liked them.
Good work, Professor, you may leave.
Pardon me. l'll leave you two kids alone.
Professor! Don't leave me. . .
Have fun then.
See you later, Nemo.
Well!
Wh-what?
Nothing in particular. lt's just that you're the first.
The first person to enter a kingdom in his underthings.
Underthings? These aren't my underthings!
They're my pajamas!
Oh. But the royal invitation was supposed to apply exclusively to you.
We did not invite a rat.
A rat?
Yes. Your pet rat. lcarus is not a rat!
And yeah, l'm wearing pajamas! So what's wrong with that?
And whose fault is that anyway? You snatched me from my bed!
You may be a princess and all, but that gives you no right to treat me like this!
What is it?
You're rather amusing.
And you're absolutely right.
Although l invited you l never specified that you dress formally.
And besides. . .
What is it this time?
Your underthings are rather charming.
They're pajamas, l said!
Come, follow me, Nemo.
Hurry. l will show you around Slumberland.
Your rat wants to accompany us, it seems.
He's not a rat.
His name is lcarus.
And call him by name, won't you!
He's my best friend.
Very well. Excuse me. l apologize. lf you're gonna apologize, apologize to the rat, not me.
Er, l mean, l didn't mean. . . lcarus, l didn't mean it.
We're best friends, aren't we? lcarus!
Come down, lcarus. l'm begging you! l'm sorry.
Fine. Then l'll climb up there. lcarus, hold it!
Got'cha!
Nemo!
So his name is lcarus?
Yes.
You are SO precious.
Oh, it's an evening drizzle.
We're having so much fun that the Rain Fairies are jealous.
BonBon! lsn't it pretty? l love this place.
Yes, it's pretty beyond words!
Just in time for lessons.
"Lessons"?
But l hate school. lf you're going to be a prince you need to learn how to act like one.
Step this way.
But what about lcarus? l'll take care of him. Have fun.
Who are these people?
They are all your teachers.
Now, let's begin the lessons.
Sit up straight and let your spoon glide.
We have lunch here at 12:30.
Very nice.
Oh dear.
Next we dance!
En garde!
Advance! Recovery!
Advance! Recovery! Advance! Recovery!
Hey, jump!
"Stand when a lady enters the room."
"Don't spit in front of others."
"Sit up straight."
"Don't yell indoors."
"Open doors for the elderly."
"Don't pick your nose."
Sit up straight! Straight, boy!
More dancing?
Prince lessons ain't easy, eh?
Let's have some pranking lessons too. See there!
They'll come looking for you soon. Wear these.
Ta-daaah.
Flip Jr. is born!
Follow me.
Where are we going?
Just trust me. lt's my house. Home, sweet home.
But it's a police station.
Won't we get caught?
We'll be fine.
Don't worry, l said.
The real fun begins here.
What the?
Why you. . .
Ow! What was that for?
Now you've done it!
Wait, wait, l'll go this way.
Hey, there are two Flips!
Stop, you!
Stop, you!!
This way.
Hey, Flap, wake up!
You've got two passengers. Step on it!
You can do it.
Go!
High in the sky!
Hurry, Flap!
There they are!
Hurry there, boy.
FLY!
Grab ahold, boy.
Sorry, gentlemen.
Let's play again some other time.
Hey, look. Music. lt's an orchestra.
This is it. This is what we call a golden opportunity.
Okay.
Now, it's your turn.
What should l do?
Do this.
Do you understand?
Yes, yes, that's right.
That's very good. You're a natural, kid!
You'll be famous in no time, kid. Just like me.
You're wanted? But why? l was too ingenious for their own good.
Wow, there's lots of towers out here.
That ain't it, boy.
Those're fireworks.
They're all set up to honor you.
Guess it's time for a little rehearsal.
Good idea!
What gorgeous fireworks! Fit for a prince!
Oops. Looks like we got some unwanted attention.
See ya later Flap.
Come, hurry!
Come on, we're going in.
Outsmarting those guys is like taking candy from a baby.
Come, let's go.
Where to?
To an even more amusing place. lt's haunted.
Cut it out, Flip.
This place is kind of creepy.
Don't be scared. The great Flip is with ya. And the real fun begins now.
Woah there. .. Boy! Are ya okay?
Are ya okay? l guess so.
That was quite a spill ya just took.
Look up there.
Looks like you just ran into a big door, kid. l've got a bad feeling about this. l think this is the door the King was telling me about.
What?
He told me not to open the door that has the same symbol as this key.
Let's open it.
But we-
Don't ya wanna know what's inside of it? l'm sure that there's something really, really big on the other side of this door.
Are you sure?
Of course l'm sure.
We'll just take a peek.
What do ya say?
But l promised the king. l swore not to open it.
But l'll keep quiet and he'll never find out.
Just trust me, kid. l guess you're right. . .
A little peek wouldn't hurt.
That's a good boy. l'll give ya a boost.
Hurry and open it, you're heavy, kid! lt's a tough lock.
Well? ls it open?
Look. See that?
Good. Open it.
But.. . we're just taking a peek.
Yeah, l know that.
Don't just stand there, help me.
Oh no!
That was close. l'm leaving. Mommy's calling me!
Flip, wait! l need to take the key out!
Flip, don't go!
Flip! l wonder where that boy went.
The coronation ceremony is about to begin!
His royal highness, King Morpheus!
Prosperity to Slumberland!
My beloved subjects, l welcome you all to my palace for this special ceremony.
The prince can't be late to his own coronation!
Move it, out of the way!
Ah, made it just in time.
Just in time? You're just very late!
And in such tasteless clothes too!
But.. .
No time for excuses!
We can't waste a single second!
Hurry, hurry.
Wait. . .
Don't take my clothes off.
Stop it.
At last he looks like a proper prince.
Calm down. Stay strong.
Come to me.
Oh, l can't stand to watch.
Subjects of Slumberland, allow me to introduce
The worthy heir l have chosen for my throne, Nemo.
As the heir to my throne, he will be henceforth called "Prince Nemo."
He must protect help Slumberland from Nightmare.
And, like this scepter, he is one of a kind.
Bow down to him as you do to me.
Step back.
My heir, behold for yourself the divine powers of my scepter
Jazama Pajama, Pajama Jazama.
Kimera-kazam, imera-tazam.
Paja-paja-jazam
Shazama, pajama, pajama!
Let me warn you all,
The only ones who are able to use this scepter are myself and Prince Nemo.
But he's just a kid. . .
But he is still young and fragile.
This scepter will be bequeathed to Prince Nemo only when he is old enough and strong enough to wield it.
Nemo, the time has arrived. Step forward, my boy. l present you with this crown,
Signifying that you now are in the royal family of Slumberland.
Prince Nemo.
As prince, your duty is to protect the key l gave you and see that no harm comes from it.
Hooray! Hooray!
Let the festivities begin!
Let's dance the night away!
As the king, l cannot let the Professor out-dance me.
Do you not agree, Nemo?
Hold this for me.
Um. . .
Hey.
Doin' fine?
Oh, Flip. . .
That's a pretty thing you've got there. Let me see it.
Don't touch it!
Did you just say something, Nemo?
Eh, uh, nothing really.
Just talking to myself. l shouldn't have opened it. l need to get that key back!
Hold this for me. l'll be right back!
Nemo, where are you going? lcarus! l don't have time to explain.
What's wrong?
King Morpheus!
Please stop the party! Please, stop!
Nemo, did something happen?
Your highness!
King Morpheus!
Want to dance too, lcarus?
Let me through. . . move it, please
Please, let me through!
King Morpheus! lt's Nightmare!
Father!
Nemo, give me the scepter!
Right away!
Nemo, hurry!
Here it is! Take it. . .
Father!
King Morpheus!
Father!
Nightmare. . . how did he get here?
Who opened that door!
He must have done it!
Get him!
Get him now!
But it wasn't me.
Nemo did it.
Flip, what are you saying? l'm sayin' the truth. l saw him do it with my own eyes.
N-no! lt wasn't me! lt was Flip!
But Nemo was the keeper of the key!
Nemo.. .
Nemo?
No! lt-it wasn't me! l-it wasn't!
No. . .
You did it. . . you. . . you.. .
NO!!
So it was a dream. . .
Nemo.. .
King Morpheus?
Where are you?
Nemo.. .
Help me!
Help me, somebody!
King Morpheus. . . l really am sorry.
What's that?
That's it! lt's the Professor.
Professor! lt's Nemo!
This way!
Come this way!
Nemo?
Nemo!
Professor! ls it you?
Take my hand.
Nemo! l thought l'd never see you again.
Where's the king?
Far away.
He was taken away to Nightmare Land.
The entire kingdom is in mourning. lt's all my fault. l did something wrong.
No, it wasn't you.
Flip is at fault.
No. l made a promise to the king.
But l broke that promise. l'll go find the king.
But, without the scepter, there is no hope of you saving him.
The scepter? l've got it right here!
See?
You had it?
Let's deliver it to the king at once! lt's no use.
We don't know where Nightmare Land is.
That's it! Flip has a map.
He does? l saw it.
What horrible timing.
He is about to be banished to outer space!
We need to stop it! Let's be fast!
Row! Row!
Row? Oh, l see. Okay then.
A blindfold? Surely you jest.
Don't make me miss out on the show.
Load the cannon!
What're ya doing?
Let me. . . l'm still smoking!
Hey, lemme out!
Help me! l'll give ya anything.
Help. . .
Ready!
Hurry!
Fire! lcarus! Where did you come from?
Where's Nemo?
Wait! Wait! Hold up!
Don't shoot the cannon!
Nemo! lt's the scepter!
Let Flip free!
What did you say? l'm gonna go find the king.
So you need to let Flip out.
But why?
He has a map to Nightmare Land.
Cancel the sentence!
These're brand label clothes, man!
Now, hand it over, Flip.
Hand over what?
The map to Nightmare Land.
Oh, that thing.
How much are ya willing to pay?
Flip!
Hand it over!
Oh, fine, l get it. You can have it.
Use it well.
Hey, easy, be gentle, man!
Hands off. lsn't it fun?
What's this supposed to mean?
Ah yes, forgot to mention it,
That map doesn't work for just anyone. lt's got a super uncrackable code attached to it.
Then you'll have to come with us.
Me? To Nightmare Land?
Sorry, but l've got errands to run. People to visit.
Prepare the cannon!
Oh fine, l guess l can come along. lf ya make me captain, that is.
After all, l'm the only one who can read the map. ls this lovely princess coming along?
You can hold my cigars for me.
Aww, you look even prettier when you're angry.
Of course l'm coming along.
You are forbidden to smoke while on the voyage!
Anchors aweigh! To Nightmare Land!
Two degrees right.
Aye-aye, Captain!
Watch the aft!
Aye-aye, sir!
Father, l hope you're safe.. .
Don't worry. He'll be okay.
Sail on, fine ship. l am the Captain!
Anything nautical is my specialty.
Owww.
Would you please take this more seriously?
Yes, absolutely, your majestyness.
Er, princess. . .
What's this noise?
Flip! Wake up! You need to take the wheel!
Flip! Help me!
Grab it! Grab on tight!
Are you all okay?
Yes, barely.
Well! My pretty dress is all ruined!
Where are we?
From the looks of things, we're in Nightmare Land.
Really? Ah, yes, of course we are.
See? l brought ya here safe.
Oh no! Looks like goblins!
Those ARE goblins!
Unhand me!
We need to help her!
Pull hard, Professor!
Ah-hah! They were scared of the scepter!
Get away from me!
Flip, the map!
The faster we move, the better. l get it. Hold your horses. . .
What happened, Flip?
Uh, nothing!
The map says. . . this way.
Watch your step. Especially be wary of the goblins. l hate this place. lt looks haunted.
Flip, are there goblins in this forest?
Naw, there ain't any goblins around here.
Which way is Nightmare Castle?
Hey, no peeking!
Just as l thought. Ah, er, this way. lt's a dead end!
Flip! Wonder where he went?
Flip! Flip!
Let's see then. . .
The forest is here.
The swamp is here.
The mountains are here.
And Nightmare Castle is here. . .
No, it's not there. lt's farther north.
Oh, thanks.
Get away, monster!
What's wrong?
Oh dear, we scared him to sleep.
Oh no!
Let Flip go! lt's the scepter! Run for it!
Flip, are you okay?
Yeah, l'm fine.
Wandering off by yourself is dangerous!
You were sneaking in a smoke, weren't you!
Those monsters forced me to smoke against my will.
No, no, we'd never do that. lt wasn't us!
But you ARE goblins.
Stop it, stop it, stop that noise!
Our ears hurt!
Don't do that again!
We're your friends.
We're good goblins.
Are you okay?
We're okay! We're a-okay!
But these guys are goblins!
They attacked me out of nowhere
And they forced me to smoke, l'm telling ya!
We didn't attack him!
And we didn't force him to smoke either!
All we did was help him draw the map!
What?
Er, l. . .
We are shape-shifting good goblins, you see.
Really?
Exactly! l'm Umpu. l'm Umpa. l'm Umpe.
And l'm Umpi!
Well!
One, two, and three!
How silly.
Nightmare is. ..
Very cruel and a liar!
He's so scary that we ran away from him!
But one of our friends is still trapped in the castle.
So we wanna go back and save him.
Nightmare is very frightened of that scepter.
That's why we want you to let us come with you!
Very well.
We know the safest way to get there - we'll guide you.
Not so fast, l'M the guide.
Not anymore. You're fired. l humbly accept your offer.
Yahoo! We got ourselves a good job!
Then what should l do?
You will carry our belongings.
Do you want me to help, Flip?
No thanks. lt may be demeaning, but it's the only job l've got left. l have a question about the spell used with the scepter.
Jazama shazama. . .
No. The second word is "Pajama". l remember that because you made fun of my pajamas.
Not so loud!
Nightmare most likely has spies around these parts.
We need to let Nightmare think that Nemo is very adept at using the scepter.
Yeah, can ya keep it down?
Ya make me carry things during the day, then ya keep me up at night. l've had enough!
A DOG gets better treatment. . .
Nemo! lt's an ambush!
Flip!
Help me!
Nemo.. .
Let me go!
Flip!
This way!
Let me go! l promise l won't smoke again!
Jazama-Pajama!
Dear Princess, l will protect you!
Professor!
Princess! Run away, run away!
Go away! Go away!
Princess! Let her go!
Nemo!
Princess!
Nemo, help me!
Jazama-Pajama!
The scepter!
What a weird dream.
Are you okay, Nemo?
What are you doing here?
We've been here all along.
So l'm still dreaming then?
Dreaming? What's dreaming?
Well, it's. . . l get it! This place is called a "dream"!
Ohhh, l get it.
Exactly, exactly. l thought so all along!
Princess. . .
Jazama-Pajama!
Hey, it's Unpo! lt's Unpo! l thought so all along!
Unpo! Were you okay?
Unpo! l am so happy to see you all again.
Wait, is that your friend you were looking for?
Yes, he's the friend that was left behind. l'm very pleased to see you, l'm Unpo
Hi. l'm Nemo.
So you're Nemo! l have a letter from you, from King Morpheus.
From the King? Where is he right now?
The last time l saw him, he was locked up in Nightmare Castle.
Where's the Princess?
Where's the Professor?
Princess?
Let me see the letter!
Here it is.
This is the spell that goes with the scepter! lt's a secret incantation. When spoken, it releases immeasurable power.
Enough power to defeat Nightmare.
That's wonderful!
But why did the King send me this?
Let's go to Nightmare Castle at once!
The King is waiting for us!
Yay! Nightmare!
Owww, that noise hurts!
Stop making the noise!
Don't scream!
My ears hurt!
Wait, wait, are you saying that if Nemo chants the spell, he'll die?
Oh dear, that is a problem. l'm worried. l was worried all along. lcarus, l'm honored that you're concerned about me.
But the king needs me. l'm sure that the King and the others are all suffering in Nightmare Castle. l need to go save them.
And l want you to come with me, lcarus. l need your help.
Okay?
Then it's decided!
Hurry, to the King!
Let's go! lt's an adventure!
Ah, me too! me too!
Okay, guys, you'll have to navigate me.
You can count on us!
And we're off to Nightmare Castle!
We're off!
Goooo!
To Nightmare Land!
Here it is! Wind Gate!
That's the entrance to Nightmare Land!
So we're finally in Nightmare Land.
Guys, ready? Keep your guard on Nemo!
Single-form transformation. . .
Go!
Hot! So hot! Someone put me out!
Watch out!
What was that thing?
Nemo! Look forward!
Look at that! lt's Nightmare Castle.
Guys! Are you ready?
Hold on tight!
Here we go!
Are you all okay?
Yes, we're okay. . .
Well then, there's supposed to be a secret entrance around here somewhere.
That impudent Nemo and that troublesome scepter,
We have cleanly disposed of them both, my Lord.
You will have full control of Slumberland in time.
All hail Nightmare Land!
There!
What? Nemo is in the castle? And he carries the scepter with him?
You filthy traitor!
Help! We're getting sucked in!
Help me!
What's wrong?
We're being pulled in.
How's it happening? l don't know!
Don't let go!
Where are we? lnside Nightmare Castle.
What was that noise? l'm not sure. l can't see anything.
Maybe we should try coming in again after it's light?
Watch out!
Let's get out!
Run and hide!
Hurry! Hurry! lt's coming!
There's the secret entrance! Hurry! lt's that way!
Ah, that was close. lsn't this a great hiding place?
We built it together.
Even Nightmare doesn't know about it.
He can't see us in here, but we can see him.
Do you seriously think you're well hidden? l know exactly where you are. l think he sees us.
Nope. He's trying to trick you.
Hand over the scepter, Nemo, and l will let you escape.
Answer me!
Now, Nemo, my patience wears thin.
Perhaps this will entice you to change your mind?
Princess! Professor! Flip!
Do you like my collection?
Stop it!
Oh, so that's where you were hiding, Nemo.
Your days are over.
That's right. l have one more item in my collection.
Perhaps this was what you wanted to see most?
King Morpheus!
How horrible!
Your Highness! l have the scepter!
Did you think he would be so easy to rescue?
Nemo!
Hurry! Get him!
Hurry!
Nemo!
Caught him!
There he is!
Nemo! Hurry!
Chant the spell, fast!
Jazama-Pajama,
Pajama-Jazama!
Shimera-Kazam!
Hurry, hurry, we're running out of time!
Ki. . .Kimera-Kazam!
What came after that? lmera-tazam!
Paja-Pajap-Shazama!
Paja. . .umm. . .
Pajap-Shazam!
Shazama-Pajama
Shazama-Pajama!
Oh no! He's coming back!
Now, let's be reasonable.
Hand over the scepter. lf you do, l will send you straight home.
To your Mommy.
Jazama-Pajama!
Pajama-Jazama!... ls that the only part you remember?
Pa. . .Pajama-Pajama
Ooooh, just the sound of the word "pajama" gives me chills.
Nemo! Behind you!
Jazama-Pajama!
Pajama-Jazama!...
Very good, lcarus! Hold on tight.
Shimera-Kazam!
Kimera-Kazam!
Nemo, don't let go!
We've got you!
Kazam. . .Shazama!
We're losing him!
Shazama. . .Pajama. . .lcarus!
Pajama!
Wh-where am l?
Nemo!
Wake up, Nemo!
Please.
Open your eyes!
How horrible!
Nemo!
Your Highness. . . l broke my promise
And l opened that door. l'm truly sorry.
No. . . Your courage defeated Nightmare.
The evil kingdom has fallen.
For all eternity.
Little Nemo, you are a perfect little prince.
Huzzah!
Farewell!
Farewell! Farewell!
Keep being a good prince, Nemo!
Hey, kid!
Flip.
Hey, Nemo, l'm gonna look after Slumberland whenever you're gone.
Jazama-Pajama!
Flip-Flap!
Pajama!
Oh, cut it out.
Flip, what are you doing!
Flip, cut it out.
Help me!
Flip, are you okay?
Flip! An official order from the Prince of Slumberland.
You are never to smoke. Forever! l second that. And we're serious this time!
Fine, fine. Adios! Nemo, my boy!
Take care, Flip!
How beautiful!
Oh, look! That's my town!
Come to me, lcarus.
Nemo.. .
What? l had so much fun.
Thank you. . . Nemo.
M-me too.
Nemo!
Nemo, wake up. lt's breakfast time.
Well! You didn't fall off your bed this morning, l see.
Did you say something?
Well, you have so much fun in store for you today.
Oh, it was all a dream.
A wonderful dream.
Looks that way. l can tell by your smile.
Mom, l'm sorry l broke my promise and took the pie.
Good morning, Nemo.
Get ready right away.
Get ready? For what, Dad?
"Get ready for what"?
We're going to the circus today.
Wanna go, Nemo?
The circus? Really? Can lcarus come, too?
Of course he can.
All right! lcarus, wake up!
We're going to the circus!
A shadow shall fall over the universe...
...and evil will grow in its path...
...and death will come from the skies.
What did you bring me?
You'll see.
Wait. Wait for me.
What is it?
Do not try to escape.
You are in my control.
Look at me.
I am the sum of all evils.
Look carefully.
My power infests all times, all galaxies...
...all dimensions.
But many still seek me out.
A green jewel they must possess.
But see how I destroy their lives.
Right 12 degrees.
Yeah, New York. Big deal.
Scum center of the world.
Now they're even talking about letting in lowlifes from other planets too.
My name's Harry Canyon.
I drive a cab.
Hey, you free?
Yeah, get in.
-Where to, pal?
-The U.N. building.
The U.N. building.
What a joke. They turned it into low-rent housing. It's a dump.
Okay, sucker, hand over your cash.
Now!
Stupid asshole.
Nobody touches Harry Canyon unless I want them to.
Father!
Run!
He's dead. Get the girl.
Help me! Please!
Normally, my rule's don't get involved.
But somehow, hey, this dame got to me.
The Loc-Nar....
They-- They wanted it, but my--
My father wouldn't tell them...
...and now I'm the only one.
Hey, relax, sister, there's a cop station up here.
You can tell them....
Oh, shit. Just what I needed.
-Police. What do you want?
-I wanna report a murder.
-What else is new?
-Hey, you gonna let me in or what?
Yeah, hang on.
Harry.
How you doing, Harry?
Hiya, Harry.
She couldn't take it, huh?
Hey, kiss my ass, will you?
I'll do it for 20 bucks.
I told you, I'm an American citizen.
I-- I just lost my papers or something.
Goddamn illegal aliens.
Before you go any further, pal,
I gotta tell you, it's cash upfront.
Thousand bucks a day for a full investigation...
...another thou if the assailant is caught. Understand?
Yeah. Hey, here's a dollar.
Thanks for nothing.
You think you can do better? Punk.
So here I was, stuck with this beautiful girl.
I knew she was gonna be nothing but trouble.
Where am I?
-My place.
-They'd have killed me if not for you.
What did they wanna snuff you for anyway?
The Loc-Nar.
An ancient relic that my father found in the desert.
It's worth a fortune, especially to the Venusians.
They think it has spiritual powers.
Does it?
All I know is that since we found it, people have been dying all around us.
When we got to New York, my father hid it.
Now he's dead.
They'll kill me next. I'm the only one who knows where it is. They'll....
Listen, nobody's gonna find you here.
You can sleep on the couch if you want.
And there's beer in the fridge.
So help yourself, all right?
I didn't know whether to believe her or not.
Something inside me told me....
Was a sucker play.
Harry?
Can I sleep with you?
Yeah, sure.
Sucker play or not, I must have turned her on something fierce...
...because this dame was going for broke.
Or maybe it was her first time with a New Yorker, I don't know.
Anyway, nothing can beat good old American know-how...
...and I was giving this broad the stars and stripes forever.
-Where's the girl?
-Where--? What--? What girl?
Don't play dumb with me, cabby.
You showed up at the station...
...with a broad over your shoulder.
Where is she?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Listen, cabbie, you hear from her, you call us.
You don't, you're dead. Understand?
Don't hold your breath, pal.
-Where's the girl?
-Come on. Not again.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
I'll get right to the point,
Mr. Canyon.
My name is Rudnick.
I represent a group of investors from a nearby planet...
...who wish to purchase something from the young lady.
The price is fair, but they're starting to get very restless.
When you see her, tell her that time is running out.
Thank you, Mr. Canyon. Good day.
The burning smell kept reminding me
I shouldn't have got involved.
But for some reason,
I just couldn't get her off my mind.
There was something about her.
An element of danger.
It really turned me on.
Transcom Message Service.
Message for Harry Canyon.
Will you accept the charges?
Meet female acquaintance at Statue of Liberty, 4:00.
Stop. End message.
The girl. Had to be her.
But first, I had to ditch a couple assholes.
That's what all the excitement's about?
I wanna get rid of it, Harry.
I want this to be over.
I talked to Rudnick.
He said he'd give me
300,000 Krono-dollars for it.
But-- But I'm frightened.
I don't trust him.
Three hundred grand is a lot of dough.
Will you help me?
When she looked at me like that...
...I knew I couldn't say no.
I'll come along for 50 percent of the take.
You can have anything you want.
Just stay with me.
There they are.
Okay. I'll keep you covered.
Hey, baby, we're rich.
What do you say we take a trip?
Hey, just the two of us.
I'd like to, Harry, but I've made other plans.
I'm taking it all.
Pull over.
-Are you sure this is what you want?
-Positive.
Pretty, but dumb.
You know, even though she would've killed me, I kind of felt sorry for her.
She was okay, just a little greedy.
As for me, I put it down as a two-day ride with one hell of a tip.
You've had your first lesson, young one.
My evil corrupts the most innocent.
I've chosen you because you possess powers...
...you do not yet understand.
Look again.
Look deep into me.
In some worlds,
I'm worshipped as God.
It all started when I found the green meteorite.
I read in Faraday's Life of the Planets that smaller ones like this...
...are supposed to burn up when they enter the atmosphere.
But for some reason, this one didn't.
So I brought it to my room, stuck it in my rock collection and forgot about it.
I was experimenting with natural electricity...
...and with the storm warnings up,
I figured tonight I'd hit the jackpot.
All I needed was a little juice.
It works!
No hair.
Big.
There was no way I was gonna walk around this place...
...with my dork hanging out.
This looked like something right out of The Ten Commandments.
Ullatec
Ullatec
Ullatec
By the powers of the glowing Loc-Nar placed in your idol's hand...
...I demand you come forth, Ullatec!
Grant me your strength in return for a living mortal sacrifice.
It has been ordained.
Come forth, Ullatec. I demand it.
What'd they do that for?
Normally, I'd be dead by now.
I kept thinking I was gonna run out of air, but my new body worked great.
I just hoped her body was working as good as mine.
Thank you.
She had the most beautiful eyes.
I wanted to make some conversation, but I found my new self...
...asking the same old stupid questions.
Are you from around here?
Well, you may not believe this, but I'm from another world...
...from a place called Earth.
Earth? I, too, am from Earth.
My name is Katherine Wells, and I'm from the British colony of Gibraltar.
You saved my life.
I have no reward to give you...
...but if any part of me pleases your senses...
...I would give it to you willingly.
This was great.
There was no way I'd get a chick like this back on Earth.
There was only one problem.
Come.
I don't know who these assholes were...
...but they sure picked a bad time to show up.
They split us up and took me to this weird castle-type place.
I wanted to find out where they'd taken Katherine...
...but none of these guys seemed to speak English.
They tell me you are Den of Earth.
The one who dared to steal the female sacrifice from the queen.
This guy was a shrimp, so I figured I'd play it tough.
Where is the girl?
I am Ard...
...supreme leader of the revolution and the next ruler of the world.
The girl!
Well, aren't we fierce?
Guards, castrate him.
Boy, I was pretty good at this stuff.
Excellent. You are worthy to serve me.
Give me the girl or die.
-Well, if I have a choice, I'll take death.
-So be it.
You'll have to do better than that.
I could see why they made this guy their leader.
But if you're really interested in the girl...
...I've had her encased in glass.
-She's dead.
-Actually, no. She's sleeping.
-But only I can awaken her.
-What do you want of me?
I want you to steal the sacred Loc-Nar.
-What is this Loc-Nar?
-The queen's glowing sphere, fool.
The sacrifice to Ullatec can only be performed...
...by the possessor of the sacred Loc-Nar.
Norl!
This is Norl, my bravest warrior.
You will go with him to the queen's castle and steal the Loc-Nar.
-Then I will give you the girl.
-And if I refuse?
If you refuse, you die, she dies, everybody dies.
Sounded reasonable to me.
Guard post ahead.
We must go underground.
This guy Norl seemed to know what he was doing.
And for a gorilla, his English wasn't half bad.
We're underneath the castle moat.
What are they saying?
They talk of the beast who prowls these catacombs...
...with a fierce hunger and sharp teeth 6 inches long.
Sorry, 16 inches long.
Now we separate.
You and Korg take this door into the queen's quarters.
The rest will move through the walls...
...and enter her chamber from the other side.
Whoever gets the Loc-Nar first will return it to Ard.
Good luck, Den.
Loc-Nar.
It was just like the ball
I dug up in the yard.
As I saw the Loc-Nar's glow,
I had this real funny feeling.
Then the lights came on.
Talk about embarrassing.
Kill them.
Can I slit his throat, Your Majesty?
Yes, slit his throat.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Stop! I have.... I have something better in mind.
-Come with me.
-Jeez, not again.
This always happens.
She's the queen.
She can do whatever she wants.
-Yeah, sure.
-Sure.
If you please me, I may let you live.
-What must I do?
-Satisfy my appetites.
Eighteen years of nothing, and now twice in one day. What a place.
The rising moon climaxes our love, Den.
-It is a sign.
-Yes, a sign.
I had no idea what she was talking about.
Neverwhere is a troubled land.
Your strength has brought great peace to my restless body.
It could bring great peace to all the troubled people of this land.
I knew I was good, but I didn't know I was that good.
Your Majesty, the Loc-Nar is missing! Stolen!
Fiend! You make love to me while your accomplice steals my scepter.
Now Ard will perform the sacrifice.
Guards! Take him! Hold him still.
I will kill him myself.
Boy, was she pissed off.
Prepare the fliers! I want his head!
By the power of the magic Loc-Nar placed in your hands...
...I command you.
Come forth, Ullatec!
Here is your sacrifice.
Ullatec, now give me your power.
Throw her in.
-Katherine!
-Den!
No! You'll ruin everything.
-Kill them! Kill them both!
-The Loc-Nar is mine!
-Stupid bitch. Get away from me.
-Give it to me.
-Give it to me.
-The Loc-Nar's mine.
Don't you take it.
I know what a Loc-Nar is.
It's my Loc-Nar.
-Where did they go?
-They're gone. That's all that matters.
They probably went back to Earth.
Boy, will Mom be surprised.
The Loc-Nar.
You could have the power of Ullatec.
You could be ruler of all these people.
Forget it.
But, Den, with the Loc-Nar, you could've returned to Earth.
I like it better here.
On Earth, I'm nobody.
But here, I'm Den.
Even when someone has the strength to discard me...
...my power is not diminished.
Someone always finds me.
Are you Captain Lincoln F. Sternn?
I am.
Lincoln Sternn, you stand here accused...
...of 12 counts of murder in the first degree...
...14 counts of armed theft of Federation property...
...22 counts of piracy in high space...
...18 counts of fraud...
...37 counts of rape...
...and one moving violation.
How do you plead?
Not guilty.
Not guilty? Are you nuts?
It's okay, Charlie. I got an angle.
Call the first witness.
But the prosecutor's got you cold.
You're as guilty as a cat in a goldfish bowl.
The prosecution calls
Hanover Fiste.
Calling Hanover Fiste.
-Hanover Fiste.
-Calling Hanover Fiste.
Listen, Sternn, change the plea to guilty.
Throw yourself on the mercy of the court.
I told you, Charlie, I got an angle.
But the most we can hope for is to get you buried in secrecy...
...so your grave don't get violated.
-Plead guilty.
-Shut up, Charlie.
I got an angle.
What angle?
Him.
State your name for the record.
I am Hanover Fiste.
You know the defendant,
Captain Sternn?
Yes, I know Captain Sternn.
And never did there live a kinder, more generous man.
I promised him 35,000 zuleks to testify on my behalf.
He's an overflowing cup, filled with the very cream of human goodness.
In all the time I've known him, he's never done anything immoral.
See?
Unless maybe the preschoolers' prostitute ring.
And he's never done anything illegal--
Unless you count all the times he sold dope disguised as a nun.
He's always been a good, law-abiding citizen--
Give me a break!
--of the Federation, and-- And--
Shut up. Shut up!
--a community-conscious individual.
Sternn.
He's nothing but a low-down, double-dealing...
...backstabbing, larcenous, perverted worm.
Hanging's too good for him.
Burning's too good for him.
-Hanover....
-He should be torn...
...into little bitsy pieces and buried alive!
Hanover....
I'll kill him. Kill!
Kill!
Hey, hey, Hanover, take it easy.
I'm sure we can talk this over.
Good.
Lost him.
Sternn!
Okay, Hanover, you've had this coming.
Now, let's see.
Thirty-three, 34...
...35,000 zuleks.
Thanks, Hanover.
-It's nothing, boss.
-And, Hanover.
-Yes?
-Goodbye.
Very few escape my grasp.
Even in death, my powers continue.
Even in death, my powers continue.
Come on, Stefan. Drop the fuckers and let's get the hell out of here.
We're hit pretty bad, Skip.
You'd better go back and see how bad it is.
Okay.
-Can you keep her in the air, Skip?
-Yeah. Yeah, sure.
Nelson?
Jeez.
Skip, something's following us.
-What is it?
-It's some kind of green meteorite.
What? Where?
Holden, are you okay?
Yeah, yeah. I'm coming back, Skip.
What the hell's happening back there?
Shit.
No. No!
No!
From one war to another, my influence is always present.
The paltry armies of the universe are but playthings to me.
Please, Dr. Anrak! Dr. Anrak!
Dr. Anrak, six more mutants were sighted in Arizona this morning.
Do you still say this has nothing to do with the green radiation from space?
Doctor, is it true that the president pulled you off the Jupiter Six project...
...so you could investigate those mutations?
Doctor, answer me that, please.
Please, the green radiations from space....
Well, what I wanna know is, what's the Army doing about this?
Hell, my constituents are turning green.
They're growing arms on their backs.
There's something or someone up there in space...
...and voters have a right to know about it.
Senator, we have no proof...
...that these mutations are the result of interference from outer space.
In fact, Dr. Anrak has just come in, so let's hear what he has to say.
-Doctor?
-First of all, there's no cause for alarm.
As for the theories of interference by alien beings...
...it is my firm opinion that we on Earth...
...are the only intelligent, technically advanced civilization...
...present in the universe.
-Thank goodness.
-That's a relief.
I was scared for a while, you know.
Very reassuring, very reassuring.
And-- And whatever is causing these mutations...
...is not from outer space.
It's more likely just an isolated biological phenomen--
Pretty. Pretty.
What is this? Doctor!
Oh, nice job.
How am I gonna fix this guy?
He's fucked.
Guess we turned it up a little too high.
-Sorry, man.
-You're sorry. What about me?
I gotta put this asshole back together.
-Where am I?
-Hey, who's the chick?
Look at my clothes.
Who's gonna pay for the dry cleaning?
I demand you return me to my office immediately.
Too late. Molecular--
Molecular instabilities...
...all around the spacecraft.
You cannot leave.
What? Is he kidding?
Oh, yeah. Instability zone.
You're stuck here.
But I have to be at my parents' for dinner tonight.
And my gynecologist appointment is on Wednesday.
Not anymore.
Would you like a drink?
Come with me.
You'll feel better after a glass of fresh blo-aak.
You have any diet soda?
Oh, typical robot.
The first Earth chick we see in 10 years...
...and he's gotta make a play for her.
Hey, do we have any of that
Plutonian nyborg left?
Yeah. Just one bag.
It's in the transmitter compartment.
Thanks, man.
Oh, great.
Think this is enough?
-No, go for broke.
-Good thinking, man.
-Nosedive!
-Nosedive!
Good nyborg.
That was incredible.
I've never felt anything like it.
Oh, great. I've been programmed to be fully proficient in sexual activities.
-Do you want to go steady?
-Gee, I don't know.
I already have a boyfriend, but....
What he does not know will not hurt him.
But I'd feel so guilty.
Of course you would.
Earth women who experience sexual ecstasy with mechanical assistance...
...always tend to feel guilty.
Really?
But I don't understand.
We laugh together...
...care for each other.
We have highly proficient sex.
Why can't we get married?
Look, we're different, okay?
Let's leave it at that.
What do you mean, different?
But mixed marriages just don't work.
I'm afraid that I'll come home one day and find you screwing the toaster.
You'll just have to trust me.
All right, all right, I'll marry you.
But on one condition:
I want a Jewish wedding.
A Jewish wedding? Okay.
I forgot, are you circumcised?
You okay to land this thing?
No problem, man.
I think you're going a little high, man.
It's okay, man.
If there's one thing I know, it's how to drive when I'm stoned.
Like, you know your perspective's fucked...
...so you just gotta let your hands work the controls as if you're straight.
Good landing, man.
My stories are almost over.
I have chosen you...
...because you are the future who could destroy me.
With your death,
I break the chain for all time.
Look into me one final time.
See my evil destroy your race.
Then prepare to die.
Death.
Death!
Death to all who oppose us!
To the council chambers!
They're killing everyone.
We must escape.
The city is burning.
Elder, we must arm ourselves.
We must fight.
Silence!
We are not a race of warriors.
We are statesmen and scientists.
From our very beginning, it was ordained...
...that the warrior race of Taarak the Defender...
...would aid us in times of need.
This was the pact.
Taarak the Defender?
His race is dead.
They cannot defend anyone.
Some say that the race is not dead, that one still lives.
One? What good is one?
One of Taarak's blood can do much.
Elder, they're in the hall!
Well, who is this last Defender?
How can he be summoned?
It is Taarna, of the blood of Taarak the Defender, the last of the race...
...and must be summoned as my forefathers summoned Taarak himself:
From within.
But will this Defender answer?
A Taarakian has no choice.
They must answer.
It is in their blood.
They're at the door.
They're here!
In the halls, quickly.
We must do something.
Bar the door.
We will summon the Defender together.
Taarna.
Taarna.
Taarna.
Taarna.
Taarna.
To defend, this is the pact.
But when life loses its value and is taken for naught...
...then the pact is to avenge.
Hey, look. A new one.
Where you from, baby?
Doesn't talk much, does she?
She doesn't have to talk for what I wanna do with her.
Come on, baby, let's see what's under there.
Hey, she's tough.
Maybe she wants to fight.
Or maybe she wants to take us all on.
You'll find them over there, beyond the oasis...
...towards the green glow.
A Taarakian.
We have captured a Taarakian.
A Taarakian?
Are you sure?
Yes, Your Holiness.
But the Taarakian race is dead...
...extinct.
She has the marks, Holiness.
I saw them.
Have her bound and washed.
Then...
...bring her to me.
And what of the bird?
Kill it.
So this is the Taarakian.
Somehow, I thought it would be more difficult...
...to capture a Taarakian.
My whips.
Pull him down.
I'll put an arrow through his head.
Mount the bats!
I want her dead!
This time you die, Taarakian bitch!
Taarna.
Do not sacrifice yourself.
You cannot destroy me.
No!
No!
No!
And the spirit of Taarna is transferred across the universe...
...to a new Defender...
...and the power of evil is contained...
...for another generation...
...and a new Taarakian is born...
...to protect the next.
Sound running, when you're ready!
Emh, well the zoo is very important to animals, they're a bit like homes, like nursing camps, and for poor animals and... emh...
...people like old people.
And there is old people which are...
...dead, and people in the wild have.. don't have much to eat so they have to kill their own people, to have something to eat.
Oh, it's very very good, very good... very comfortable, you know?
We have well looked after us and's a nice position.
They try to make you comfortable, they try to put you in a... a quite nice situation, with the standart food, that look more like dog food, than food proper for wild animals, alright?
Well... emh... most of the cages are a bit small and... grossy and erverything ***... big pools to play arround and there's lots of in there, they looked really happy.
There *** comfortable, I suppose, this place but... emh...
...emh...
...I mean,
I've been in more comfortable rooms, yes...
If you try to compare, the situations and the environment that we live in here with the environment that we live in Brazil, there's a big difference. HERE, you live in a very small place with all the technological advances possible.
You have... eh... everything sorted out, double glasing, and you know, you're heating and everything in Brasil, but you don't have the space!
In Brasil you have the space although you don't have all this technological, you know, double glasing and things like that...
...you know... but you have the space and... eh... we need a space to live, we need a space to feel that we are part of the world, and not a kind of a piece of object in a box!
My room is a bit too small to me,
Ive got so much stuff in that.
If I'd get anything new, *** put it.
Well, sonetimes you can't get out on *** as much as you would like to.
You're stuck in for some reason, like I'm stuck in today.
And then yes, you ged fed up with your *** four walls.
I try to spend as little time in here as possible, but you can't actually get out ***.
I use to escape into books and things.
I feel very secure.
I'm well looked after, very well looked after, and I've... I'm never worried about anything.
I know, whatever happens, they look after me, and put me where I hope to be.
I think they'd like it in the wild if they were in the wild, but I think it's much better to be in... emh...
...***, because, like those said, they get fed, there was some animals, they go for days without food!
Because animals in the circus, they have to... emh... get on boxes and ***...
But animals in the zoo, they don't have to do anything.
They can do their own things like...
...drinking and eating.
I miss somewhat of the food,
I miss the fresh meat! You know, because in Brasil we are predominantely carnivores.
We are not, you know, vegetarian!
And we don't like potatoes, we like meat!
And we like fresh meat!
My favorite food is, I'm afraid to say, steak!
I'd go...
...Emh, do you like lions...
...emh... do you like lions as well then?
Do you like steaks and chips with lions with it?
Not with lions, Andrew, no. I don't like lions steak,
I prefer the ordinary steak.
I'd like to live somewhere a bit hotter.
I don't like getting rained on and I don't like being cold.
And I find that here I often get rained on and I'm often cold...
Where I would like to leave and spend the rest of my live?
In a hot country!! You know, in a hot country, that I have good weather, and that I have space and that I have trees, you know?
That I don't have only grass, with ballings that give me hayfever everyday!!
I need space with blue sky, without... that I can see the sun everyday, alright?
That I have nice weather, that I can just have nice water, you know, to dive, to swimming, it means a tropical country!
Not in an island, a cold one!
Is easy, any part of the world, but hot!
Name it, and I go!

THE TIME MASTERS
Why are you going so fast?
It's just for fun
Hello, Jaffar?
Calling Jaffar
Claude here. Answer me!
Come in!
- Who are you talking to?
- Jaffar?
This is Claude.
Where are you?
Can you read me?
I'll leave a message
Jaffar, this is Claude
I'm calling from the planet Perdide
Northern hemisphere, 73rd sector
Jaffar, the hornets attacked us by surprise!
It was horrible
Annie is dead
I'm heading for the Dolongs
Jaffar, I've crashed
I'm trapped. I'm sending Piel into the Dolongs with a microphone
Come get him, for God's sake!
Hurry!
I beg you!
Goodbye, Jaffar...
...and thank you
Claude
Here, Piel. Catch this
- What is it?
- It's a toy that can speak
- Is this a toy?
- Yes, it's a microphone
Call it Mike.
Mike is a friend of yours
When Mike talks to you, you must do exactly what he says
Now run as fast as you can to the Dolongs...
...and stay there until the machine...
...until Mike... talks to you
I can't run. My knee hurts
Anyway, I don't want to go into the Dolongs
I want to go home
Your mummy doesn't want us to come home right now
Do as I say!
Run into the Dolongs
Run, I tell you! Run!
Well done, very nice!
What's the matter?
- You idiot
- What's got into you?
What are you doing?
Look what's happening
We almost collided with that meteor while you were taking a nap
I thought the collision-swerve control was automatic
Yes, but only for masses that weigh less than 10,000 tons
Well, I didn't know
You don't know much
Hello
I have refreshments for the navigators
- Is anything wrong?
- No, it's all good
You must be joking!
How long has this signal been on?
How should I know? I don't understand anything about this tub of yours
Jaffar, this is Claude
Where are you?
Can you read me?
I'll leave a message
Jaffar, this is Claude
I'm calling from the planet Perdide
Northern hemisphere, 73rd sector
16:50, universal time
Jaffar, the hornets
attacked us by surprise!
It was horrible
Annie is dead
I'm heading for the Dolongs
Jaffar, I've crashed
I'm trapped. I'm sending Piel
to the Dolongs with a microphone
Come get him, for God's sake!
Hurry!
I beg you!
Goodbye Jaffar...
and thank you
Piel! Can you hear me?
Answer, if you hear me
Can you hear me, Piel?
Answer me!
I don't like you, and I don't like your lights
Mike!
I don't like you either
What?
I didn't know you could hear me, Mike
Piel, is that you?
Of course it's me
Where are you?
Right here, in front of you
Piel, I'm speaking to you
from very far away
Look, Jaffar, he can't understand
- Perhaps you should...
- Why do you have two voices?
Answer, Mike.
I know your name is Mike
Why do you have two voices?
You're right, Piel.
My name is Mike
And I have two voices because I have practically nothing else
I don't have eyes to see with, nor legs to walk with...
...nor arms to hold things with
So instead, I have two voices...
...and I can even have more than that
- Do you understand?
- I think so
- You're in a forest now, aren't you?
- Yes
- With glowing red and yellow fruit?
- Yes, that's right
Good. Just wait there.
A big spaceship will come to get you
Wait a minute!
We're not going to Aldebaran anymore?
That's exactly it!
But we're paying you a fortune to take us to Aldebaran
You can't break your word
I didn't promise anything,
Prince Matton
Aldebaran was on my way and you asked to join the ship...
...with half the public treasury that you pocketed
- Only that which was mine
- Don't make me laugh!
The police of the Interplanetary
Reformed Alliance are on your tail
Your destination makes no difference to you
It could be Aldebaran, or anywhere else, just as long as you get away
Yes, I've changed our destination
It's no longer Aldebaran.
It's Perdide
Consider yourself lucky that you're going anywhere and I've taken pity on you
And don't smoke on board!
Oxygen is precious
Go back to your cabin and buckle up
To get to Perdide, we'll have to land on Devil's Ball...
...and then go to Gamma 10
We'll have to wait for the passage of the Blue Comet
By keeping within its magnetic field, we'll be able to approach Perdide
Mike, why are you so quiet?
Piel, I'm busy right now
I'll talk to you later
Oh, they're lovely
Silbad calls them his shrews
Jaffar, you rascal!
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
Perdide would be nice, if it weren't for the hornets
You know about the hornets of Perdide, Princess?
Here. Look at this
The hornets of Perdide did this to me years ago
They like to eat the human brain...
...just as if it were a soft-boiled egg
Mr Silbad, please...
Sorry, Prince
So what were you saying about your friend Claude?
- Claude had a son called Piel
- A son!
Having a wife is bad enough, but a son as well...
- Jaffar, your friend is crazy!
- He's dead
Those hornets again
His wife too, and the boy?
The boy's taken refuge in the Dolongs
As long as he stays there, he's safe
The pollen from the trees keeps off the hornets
Are there settlers around?
Piel is totally alone on Perdide
How old is he?
He must be somewhere between five and ten Earth years
The only link you have with him is through that mike?
A little marvel, that thing!
Instant communication anywhere in Space Four
Yes, Claude gave it to me
He thought I might need help one day.
But he was the one who needed it
Let me think
They've been singing for three days.
They'll soon metamorphose
- It could work
- What could, Mr Silbad?
If someone who knows Perdide very well...
...remains in contact with the boy...
...and keeps telling him what to do...
...he'll make it, he'll manage to get out
How long will it take you to get there?
Hello, Piel. Are you there?
How would you like to hear a song?
Listen to this!
It's the song of the Lamprey Guzzlers.
Do you know that one?
No, sing it to me, Mike
I'm a galactic lush
The kind that will buy you a drink
I'm a cosmic tramp
and I roam without a blush
I'm the Astro Guzzler
But believe me when I say
Sometimes I feel very depressed,
and I end up in the gutter
I'm a nasty piece of work
Sometimes it's true I go berserk
A really long time ago
How long exactly, who knows?
I was having a ball on the Lamprey
with all the friends I know
Suddenly I realised
I might have drunk too much
But the hell with it,
you only have one life
One drink after another
Like a famous Guzzler
Alcohol is flowing
and that's what matters
I'm the interstellar fool
Space is so beautiful
Let's have another drink
and then we'll...
You ought to be ashamed of yourself...
...singing this kind of song to a child
Why did you stop, Mike?
Keep singing
I'll sing the rest later on
Right now, little one, I want you to eat one of those pretty red fruits
I'm tired of them.
Isn't there anything else?
Do you want me to get angry?
OK, OK...
What's a lamprey?
Ah, my boy,
that was a proud space vessel...
... the last of an illustrious fleet
What's a guzzler?
Well, now, that's, er...
Guzzle... that means sort of to drink
So guzzlers are people
who like to drink just a tiny little bit
You know, Mike,
I'd like to drink something as well
- I'm thirsty
- I've already told you
You can drink the juice
of the red fruit
I don't like that taste
I'd like some water
Listen
I know something that's much better than water
Are there giant strawberries near where you are?
Enormous juicy strawberries?
I can't see any
Look around a little
They grow on the trunks of trees.
There must be some around
There's one, over there
Right. I'm standing in front of your big, fat strawberry
- What shall I do now?
- You see those soft, round spots on it?
- Yes
- Burst them open with your finger
Something will flow out
that's much better than water
That's good!
Are you crazy, Silbad?
First you sing him drinking songs and now you're trying to get him drunk
Under the circumstances, my friend, we can't be choosy
The juice of the legol contains an alkaloid
It's harmless but it will help him sleep...
...and keep him out of trouble
Are you sure it won't poison him?
If he soaks it up for a month straight, then maybe yes, it could be harmful
But he'll get over it very quickly.
Believe me. I know from experience
He'll be OK
I really like your friend
Yeah, he's quite a character, isn't he?
He certainly is
Maybe I'm just imagining things
Not completely, Belle
The fact is, Silbad does suffer
- In his head?
- No, in his heart
Silbad has been hopelessly in love for 20 years
- In love? With whom?
- With this planet
You're going to witness something very rare
Close your minds!
We're here!
- What's that?
- The metamorphosis of the shrews
But be careful.
Those little scamps are telepathic
Close your minds!
We're here!
Careful, close your minds!
Leave us in peace.
Go on, be off with you
Close your mind, human.
I hear everything
Look! Two of them seem to be stuck
Yes. And the petals are closing again
Stay here. I'll go
Hello, Piel?
Little Piel, do you hear me?
Would you go and fetch the prince, please?
To enter the Blue Comet's magnetic field, we have to leave in an hour
I bet you'd be more than happy to abandon the prince here
- Certainly not!
- You and your code of honour
Hello. Who are you?
Come on, now
Don't be afraid of me
Am I afraid of you?
Of course not
Isn't it you who took my Mike?
Listen, you old pirate, are you sure everything's OK?
We haven't heard from the boy in a while
That's true. He should have been awake for some time now
Ssh! I can hear something
It's as if he were a long way from the mike
Answer me!
Well, I can't shout any louder
We have to make a sound that will catch his attention
Do you know the war cry of the fighting monks of Guamar 35?
Then cover your ears
No comments, please
Just wait
Mike, was it you who shouted like that?
Are you all right?
It sounded like you were very far away from me
There was a big animal sitting on you
- I'm glad I found you again
- Me too, little one
What happened?
I heard a terrifying noise
It was nothing, my dear lady
I was just clearing my throat
I drew it from memory
Here's the Desert of the Sangs
The Dolongs are here
Claude arrived from the west in his machine
So, the little fellow had to cross through here
Right... Now there are only a few caves there
Piel must have used a cave for shelter
My dear lady, the caves of Perdide are full of Sarpeels
- Full of what?
- Sarpeels
Another scourge on Perdide
They're very dangerous creepers
Oh, how awful!
- Do you think Piel is...
- No. I've questioned him
He hasn't got near the caves
I'm worried about the lake
The lake?
What's the danger there?
It's just a body of water per se, filled with friendly little fish
However, a kid can drown, and the hornets can get nearby
By now, Piel must be very close to it
There's something odd going on behind that screen
Something that doesn't...
Hey! Stowaways!
The others preferred to remain on Devil's Ball
To await the next transformation
Something stinks here
Mind your language in front of a lady!
Oh, dear. Perhaps it's my perfume
No, madam, not on your life.
Your perfume is exquisite
You must excuse Yula.
He's talking through his hat
- A bad telepathic smell?
- That's it!
There's a thought here that stinks, don't you think, Jad?
Now, enough of that.
I'm ashamed of you
Don't you know how to behave in polite company?
Anyway, it's gone now
Piel, are you there?
Yes, I'm here... and I'm getting fed up with being here too
Yes, I understand, dear Piel
So for a change,
why don't we take a little walk?
I don't want to take a walk.
I want to be somewhere else
Of course, but to be somewhere else,
you have to walk
I want you to go to the lake
You'll be able to get washed there
Why? I'm not dirty
All right, you don't have to wash
But the lake's pretty.
You'll enjoy it
Well, if I don't have to wash, OK then
How do I get there?
First, you have to turn your back
to the moon
Why have you changed your voice again?
I liked the other ones better
The others have to rest
How much farther is the lake?
You'll be there in just a few minutes
I'm going to see what the prince is up to
Here you are.
I was wondering where you'd gone
Well, I just wanted to be useful
Since no one was looking after Piel,
I thought I would
Any new developments?
No. He's asleep
Look! Like this, it's more beautiful
Why own sparkling things, if all you do is lock them in a bin like rubbish?
You know how it is
Human beings, at least some of them, don't care about the beauty of things
Only their value interests them
"Value"?
What's "value"?
It's a concept.
I read it in their thoughts
And what's a concept?
To tell you the truth, I'm not too sure
It's something that drives men crazy...
...at least some of them, like Prince Matton
Now there I agree with you
His thoughts smell terrible
Perhaps we should warn the others
They're humans, space mate.
We are gnomes
It's best that we each mind our own business
"Business"? What's "business"?
Humans have their way of doing things...
...and we have our own
I suppose you're right, but Prince Matton's thoughts still stink
Right. From this point on, we can rely on the computer
It'll put us in orbit around Gamma 10...
...until the Blue Comet passes
Then it'll send us into its gravitational field
Since we'll be orbiting Gamma 10...
...would we have enough time to land there?
We could if we wanted to
All right, I'll relieve you now
But I prefer to stay here and look after the kid
You see, Jaffar...
...when I said a little while ago that I wanted to be useful...
...I truly meant it
The thoughts of that human keep smelling worse and worse
Well, close your mind, space mate
Those are human affairs, not ours
- Piel?
- Well, it's about time!
What happened to you?
Did you fall asleep?
Never mind.
Just tell me, are you still walking?
Don't forget, you have to reach the lake
But I'm already there
Are you!
- And what have you been doing?
- I saw a big fish
Is that all?
Did you get washed?
You said I didn't have to
I've changed my mind.
You have to take a bath
Go into the water and head towards the middle of the lake
But I'll drown!
Of course you won't, you little fool
If you carry me with you,
you'll be safe
I'll make you float on the water.
You'll see
Are you in the lake yet?
Yes, but it's cold
Walk to the middle of the lake
Keep walking. Forward!
Obey me!
I am walking,
but this is getting deep
- No, Piel! Stop!
- Belle!
- Don't move
- You wouldn't dare...
Mike! What did you say?
What do you want me to do now?
I'm cold,
and I'm almost out of my depth
Piel, turn around and get out of the water!
Get out of this lake at once!
Belle, listen. I can explain
It's perfectly clear
But if we continue to Perdide, we're finished
They'll take my treasure
We'll be miserable tramps, roaming from planet to planet
Jaffar, please come here immediately
Right. I'm coming
Go to the Dolongs, dry yourself, and wait there until I speak to you again
I have to think for a moment
Belle, have pity on me.
Try to understand
Tell Jaffar I tried to kill the child, and he'll throw me out into space
Belle, please, I beg you!
- What's going on?
- Mike!
I did what you told me to do
I've come out of the lake,
and I'm drying myself
Now what should I do?
- Just wait there
- I see
- May I make a suggestion?
- Go ahead
Oh, no!
There go all our decorations
All that work for nothing
I'm beginning to think that the human race is crazy!
Let me out! I'll kill you!
I swear, I'll kill you!
What a nightmare!
We've got to do something
I can't take any more of that guy's thoughts
I'll simply die if he carries on like this
He's giving me a splitting headache too
Look.
He wants to get out of here, right?
Perhaps we could...
Don't talk nonsense
That guy is a cosmic danger
Jad, I'm getting sick
Let's help him escape
All he wants is to take the shuttle to go to Gamma 10
That's not all.
He also wants to recover his treasure...
...to recruit mercenaries and massacre everybody
No. We can't let him get away
- He'll never come back from Gamma 10
- How do you know?
Can't you hear that planet?
Hear it? It's bursting my eardrums
Mine too, space mate
That's a world I don't want to have anything to do with
- He'll never leave it
- No. Not a chance
Well, then, shall we liberate that monster?
Look out
Little white boy
Look out
For your gloomy thoughts
Look out
My little Astro
Look out
For the black holes
Look out
Little white boy
Look out
For certain looks
Everything's fine now, Mike
I'm warm and I'm sleepy...
... and I like it
when you sing like my mum
Go to sleep now, Piel
I love you, Mike
And I love you too, little Piel
What's going on?
Someone's ejected in the shuttle!
- It's the prince!
- Prepare the emergency capsule
What kind of planet is this?
What happened?
I don't know, space mate...
...but a little more of it and I think my brain would have melted
I thought mine was turning to stone
We have to do something
First of all, let's not lose Jaffar
Jad, I'm afraid
I'm afraid of what's under that dome
Me too, space mate.
I'm terrified
We're the ones who got Jaffar into this mess
Now we'll have to get him out of it
We must contact the others in the spaceship
We can try
That thing is liable to swallow our brains
My dear lady, there's nothing we can do but wait...
...and hope Jaffar will make it back before the passage of the Blue Comet...
...which means he only has five hours
At last! Where were you?
Do you think it's easy for us, with that thinking thing?
It's no use. It's too sturdy
But take off my helmet.
The air is breathable here
Listen. You're going to have to pilot the shuttle
Tune in on my thoughts, and I'll show you how to fly it
Take it back up to the spaceship
Tell Silbad to catch the Blue Comet, and go and save the boy
And desert you?
Out of the question
I think it's a pretty good idea
Why don't we get out of here?
We can always return later to save Jaffar
Of course. Yula is right
No. Yula is wrong, and he knows it
Yula, I'm ashamed of you
You're a coward, a scaredy-cat, a cry-baby and a milksop
And what's more, you're spineless, chicken-hearted
You know what will happen to Jaffar in just a few hours, if we leave him here
I can take care of myself
Not against that, Jaffar.
Not against that thing
- What thing?
- It doesn't have a name
It's... It's pure thought
Don't worry.
I can handle pure thought
I'm afraid you can't
The thought will absorb you as it has all the others
- What others?
- Those who set foot on Gamma 10
They look perfectly normal
Now they're puppets... puppets of that thing
Brothers!
It is time!
Once again, difference has intruded on Gamma 10
Once again, the ceremony must take place
Once again, difference must be abolished...
...and unity restored
Here they come!
I smell their thoughts
Relax. We still have a minute
Pull, Jaffar!
They're coming!
They're coming!
Jad, is there anything I can do?
Against the thing, your thought is powerless...
...a feather against a mountain
- That is, unless...
- Unless what?
Unless you can turn your thought against itself and any other thought
If you can become pure denial, pure hate, pure insane fury...
Then there's a slim chance that you can annihilate the thing
But you will annihilate yourself at the same time
- I prefer to be destroyed than enslaved
- They're here!
Hurry to the shuttle, and do exactly as I told you
Obey!
- Goodbye, Jaffar
- Hurry!
Jaffar, do you think
I'm a coward and a cry-baby...
...and all those things
Jad called me?
Of course not.
You're a sweet little gnome, Yula
And you've very brave.
Now goodbye
Thank you, Jaffar
Here is the second individual
Let's carry him to the bliss of the sameness
Happiness
Happiness upon them!
Happiness upon us!
Happiness!
Unity!
Are they going to turn us into fodder for that blob?
It's more complicated than that...
...but that's the general idea
I suggest that we fight and die together
That won't do any good
Don't you understand?
I say we fight them
We can wipe out a few dozen before they crush us
The enemy is there, Matt
All those poor creatures are nothing but puppets
Then let's attack the blob
- There must be something we can do!
- Yes, there is one thing
When we're absorbed into it...
...when it tries to turn us into contented puppets...
...we must hate and deny ourselves with all the force in our minds
We must become madmen in order to drive it mad
But even if we succeed...
...it will cost us our lives and our souls
That suits me fine
My life isn't worth much, and my soul is worth nothing
The ceremony has begun!
In a few moments...
...the unhappy ones...
...will lose their individuality
They will be one with us
We will be one with them!
All will be unified!
Say, space mate.
Your thoughts have an odd smell
Your intention is a funny colour
That's because I don't appreciate you calling me a coward
Come on. We have very little time before the Blue Comet passes
Right. Hold tight!
Let's go, Matt!
Goodbye!
No, Jaffar, I'll go!
If you ever get out of this, take care of Belle
Monstrous violation!
Difference is opposing unity!
One individual is hurling himself into totality!
The ceremony... is disrupted!
The individual denies it with all his strength!
He denies totality!
Difference denies unity!
Hatred denies happiness!
Folly denies peace!
Jad, Yula!
By the rings of Saturn!
What are they doing down there?
I swear, they've started an interplanetary war
Why are you so quiet, Mike?
Are you worried?
No, everything is all right, Piel
Look, Belle! He did it!
He's returning!
Prepare for departure
- Jaffar, do you read me?
- Roger
May I be bamboozled by the mighty stars!
What in the devil's name is all that?
Sorry. I was a little too busy to warn you
We have guests for dinner
You're a funny Wah-wah, aren't you?
Have you lost your pals?
Let's go and look for them together
Are you quite sure he's gentle?
Oh, yes, Mike.
He's a good friend
Piel's walking with a thing that goes, "wah-wah"
There's nothing to fear.
It's just a hippornithorhynchus
Gentle as a lamb and strictly vegetarian
How are you feeling, Yula?
You know very well
Poor thing!
When they're asleep, their thoughts smell the strongest
I don't understand why humans stuff themselves with food and drink...
...as soon as they meet
Not only humans
Did you see how much that Centaurian packed away last night?
I can understand, but...
I beg your pardon?
Excuse me.
I'm tuned into...
...the thoughts of that moustached man...
...who drank three quarts of moonshine last night
He can't prevent...
...his glottis from convulsing and neither can I
Try to close your mind
I can't.
I have the hangovers of...
...32 people, all at the...
...same time
- Is everything all right?
- Yes
Belle, I haven't yet told you how Matton died
Don't bother. I'm sure he died as I wish he would have lived...
...with generosity and courage
Silbad?
- Trouble?
- Yes
We are being pursued
by a warship of the Reform
Great! Let's attack them!
Easier said than done.
Right, everyone
Meeting in the conference room
at once
This is the space cruiser Silver Vessel, of the Reform Patrol Fleet
Unidentified ship, maintain your speed
We are going to board you
This is spaceship Double Triangle 22, receiving you
We await your visit with humble respect
Captain Jaffar
If you hadn't saved my life...
...I'd cut your throat for your cowardice
Do you want to surrender to them?
I want them to board us
You and your comrades need your own ship, right?
Well, you can get theirs, but only by letting them board ours first
The captain's right.
We're stalking big game
We must proceed with caution
If you have any ideas...
I believe I have one
Allow me to present my good friend,
Onyx the Digeed of Gnaz
What's he supposed to do, make them die laughing?
Quiet!
My friend has the natural ability to mimic anything
Go ahead, Onyx, give us a little demonstration
Amazing!
It even has the smell
Onyx fully controls his molecular structure...
...and can change it in an infinite number of ways
Hey, Onyx...
...change yourself into a secret weapon
Something dreadful!
By the rings of Saturn!
It's amazing what they can do nowadays
As you can see, the illusion is perfect
I must admit, that opens up a lot of possibilities
What do you think, Silbad?
I think the Reformists are in for a bad time
A ship full of foul-smelling thoughts is approaching
Attention, everyone
As soon as the airlock is sealed, keep your mouths shut
Jad and Yula, if anything goes wrong...
...warn me by telepathy
Honourable representatives of the Reform...
...I welcome you on board my humble ship
Your ship is giving refuge to Matton, the traitor, former prince of Atral
And the treasure chest that was stolen by the traitor
Silence
Actually, it was while defending this mysterious chest that Matt...
...that the prince was murdered by the pirates of Gamma 10
Matton is dead?
And where's the chest now?
In the hold, with the pirates we took prisoner
Let's go and see that treasure chest
- Halt! Leave that here
- But it's not a weapon
Do as you're told!
Me and Wah-wah found a cave
We'll be safe here until his friends come
Go on, Wah-wah.
Go on in
Don't leave me alone.
Do something!
What a bunch!
Our prisoners... the pirates of Gamma 10
May I suggest that Your Excellencies have these creatures re-educated?
Perhaps. We'll see
Everything's fine, Jaffar
They don't see the trap
They don't see anything.
They're all blind
Captain, that was a good catch
Guards, prepare for immediate transhipment
Silbad, how long do you think it will take them to become masters of the vessel?
With the Digeed, their secret weapon, two hours...
They might prefer to stretch out the pleasure
The microphone is no longer working
- Answer me, little one!
- We've lost him!
I'm afraid we'll never hear from him again!
Come on, Belle.
Don't worry
Silbad will fix it
There's nothing to fix. The problem is, there's no one at the other end
No offence, but you're not very pretty
In fact, you're ugly... all of you
Go away!
Do you hear me?
Go away!
Clear off!
I've given her a sedative
She's convinced it's her fault
Nonsense. Something must have happened on Perdide
Fortunately, we're getting nearer
Soon the computer will release us from the Blue Comet's gravitational field
Hello, Piel?
Can you hear me?
The stars, they're fading out in the sector of Perdide
What is that?
A magnetic storm?
I don't know
But all the dials are going crazy!
Or maybe we are...
What's going on?
According to these instruments...
...all the radiations in the sector, including light...
...are going backwards!
Buckle up, quick!
Attention
This is Patrol Robot number five...
... of the fleet of the Federation
of the Time Masters
This is a warning
You are approaching
the forbidden zone of Perdide
Identify yourselves
and decelerate to a stop
I repeat
You are entering a forbidden zone
Identify yourselves and stop
Calling adviser Pixa
An unidentified vessel
is entering the forbidden zone
Its course is irregular
Shall we destroy it?
No. I want a thorough investigation
Board the vessel
and escort it to the base
Captain Jaffar and his crew should consider themselves lucky
We managed to save those odd creatures
Good. They're very valuable from a scientific point of view
- Silbad as well?
- Yes
But in truth, the old man is dying
It's just a question of hours
You and your ship were at the fringe of the danger area...
...when the operation took place
- What operation?
- Do you know where we are?
Well, I can see we're in a hospital somewhere in space
Not just somewhere in space, Princess
We are in a particular zone now being colonised by the Time Masters
Have you ever heard of their method of accelerated colonisation?
No, never
It's a strange race, Princess
They can manipulate time itself
When they decide to colonise a planet, they project it into the past...
...literally send it backwards through time
In the case of Perdide,
60 years backwards
So for those on a distant ship...
...it would seem as if light rays were speeding in reverse...
...and all of space were going mad
Exactly. But to those on the planet being colonised...
...everything seems normal...
...except that their present time would be that of 60 years ago
And that's what happened to Perdide
My God, Piel!
Mike...
Jaffar, how old is Silbad?
No one knows
No one's ever known anything about his childhood
Keep quiet
The old man's past is rising from the depths
- Shut your eyes, humans
- And open your minds
For what was hidden in the folds of time can now be revealed
Now long-lost memories...
...the unknown past of a small child...
...will be projected on your mental screens
Shut your eyes, humans, and open your minds
Mike! Mike!
- It's Piel's voice!
- Silence, humans
It's Piel...
...just as he was when we were approaching Perdide
No, Belle.
It's Piel as he was 60 years ago
It's Piel hurled into the past, along with the entire planet...
...by the Time Masters
Lowry! Cover me!
Get away from him, filthy creatures!
I hope those filthy beasts didn't hurt you too much, son
I've done everything I could
The doctors on my planet will do the rest
And now the best thing you can do is sleep
Where are we now, Lowry?
What sector is it?
Those monsters!
Speak up, Lowry!
Didn't you hear me?
I'm sorry. I was thinking
You're getting old, Lowry
Alas, Igor, aren't we all?
I'll have none of your insolence!
Now, then, be good enough to explain to me...
...why we suddenly found ourselves on the surface of a planet...
...when just a moment before we were in empty space?
- Were you daydreaming?
- I had nothing to do with it, Igor
It was the planet's fault
- What planet?
- The planet Perdide
It suddenly appeared before us
Come now, don't be silly!
- Where did it come from?
- From the future
Lowry!
I think you're becoming senile
I am not becoming senile!
The planet Perdide surged out of
the future and almost smashed into us
But the child, Lowry, the child...
Did he also "surge out of the future", as you say?
Exactly, Igor, with the planet
It's stopped
I know what happened.
The child recovered
He became a cabin boy, then a space sailor...
...a pilot, a mercenary...
...a hundred other things that filled 60 years of his life
The orphan of Perdide is dead, humans
He has left our time to enter into eternity
It's strange
There are only a dozen, but I sense the emotions of a thousand
I know. Me too
Where is it all coming from?
From the heart...
From the heart, Yula
I believe we loved that old man very, very much
Look up there!
A Time Master
Mommy's going to the beauty parlor, darling.
But I'm leaving you with your favorite friend, Roger.
He is going to take very, very good care of you.
Because if he doesn't, he's going back to the science lab!
P-p-please, don't worry.
Whatever you say.
Yes, ma'am. Aye, aye, sir. Okeydokey.
Why, I'll take care of him like he was my own brother.
Or my own sister.
Or my brother's sister.
Or my second cousin
- who is twice removed.
- Gobble. Cookie.
Or my ninth cousin, who is nine times removed from his place outside.
Or like my 15th cousin, who is 16 times removed from my mother's side.
Or like my 27th cousin, who is 37 times...
- Cookie.
- ...removed from my father's side.
Like my 17th cousin, who is
156 times removed from any side!
I'll save you, Baby!
Cookie.
Don't burn yourself,
Baby Herman.
Who turned out the lights?
It's dark in here.
Don't they pay their electricity?
What's happened?
I'll find you, Baby. Where are you?
- Where are you?
- Cookie.
Where'd you go?
What's that smoke?
Cookie.
Cookie.
I'm here, Baby...
Cookie.
Cookie.
- Cut!
- All right. That's it, guys.
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut!
What the hell was wrong with that take?
Nothing with you, Baby Herman.
You were great. You were perfect.
You were better than perfect.
It's Roger! He keeps blowing his lines!
- Roger, what's this?
- A tweeting bird?
"A tweeting bird?" Roger, read the script. Look what it says!
It says, "Rabbit gets clunked, rabbit sees stars."
Not birds, stars!
Can we lose the playback, please?
- Roger, you're killing me! Killing me!
- Cut the playback!
For cryin' out loud, Roger!
How many times do we have to do this damn scene?
Raoul, I'll be in my trailer, takin' a nap!
Excuse me, toots.
My stomach can't take this.
This set is a mess.
Clean this set up! And get him out of there, or seal him up in it!
- Lose the lights! And say "lunch"!
- Lunch!
That's lunch. We're on a half.
P-please, Raoul. I can give you stars!
Just drop the refrigerator on my head one more time!
Roger, I dropped it on your head
23 times already.
- I can take it! Don't worry about me.
- I'm not worried about you.
I'm worried about the refrigerator.
I can give you stars. Look. Look!
Look!
Please, Raoul,
I can do it, I swear.
Just give me another chance.
Oh, come on, Raoul.
Toons.
Look! Look, Raoul! Look, Raoul!
Come on, Raoul!
Mr. Maroon, Mr. Valiant's here to...
He'll be right with you.
No, no, no!
Wait until he gets to his feet.
- Then hit him with the boulder.
- Right, R. K.
How much do you know about show business, Mr. Valiant?
Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
Yeah, and there's no business more expensive.
I'm 25 grand over budget on the latest Baby Herman cartoon.
You saw the rabbit blowin' his lines.
He can't keep his mind on the work.
You know why?
One too many refrigerators dropped on his head?
Nah, he's a Toon.
You can drop anything you want on his head. He'll shake it off.
But break his heart, he goes to pieces, just like you or me.
Read that.
"Seen cooing over calamari with not-so-new sugar daddy,"
"was Jessica Rabbit, wife of Maroon Cartoon star Roger."
What's this got to do with me?
You're the private detective.
You figure it out.
Look, I don't have time for this.
Look, Valiant, his wife's poison, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.
I want you to follow her, get me a couple of nice, juicy pictures
I can wise the rabbit up with.
- Forget it. I don't work Toontown.
- What's wrong with Toontown?
Every Joe loves Toontown.
Then get Joe to do the job,
'cause I ain't goin'.
Fella.
You don't want to go to Toontown, you don't have to go to Toontown.
Nobody said you had to go to Toontown anyway.
Have a seat, Valiant.
The rabbit's wife sings at a joint called the Ink and Paint Club.
"Toon Revue."
Strictly humans only, okay?
So what do you think, Valiant?
Well?
The job's gonna cost you
100 bucks, plus expenses.
A hundred bucks?
- That's ridiculous!
- So's the job.
All right, all right.
You got your 100 bucks.
- Have a drink, Eddie.
- I don't mind if I do.
- I got it.
- Careful, Dave.
- I got it!
- Dave, you're gonna drop it!
- I'm not gonna drop it!
- You're droppin' it!
Watch it! Oh, no! Jeez!
Come on!
Kind of jumpy, aren't you, Valiant?
- It's just Dumbo.
- I know who it is.
I got him on loan from Disney, him and half the cast of Fantasia.
The best part is they work for peanuts.
Well, I don't work for peanuts.
Where's the other 50?
Let's call the other 50 a carrot to finish the job.
You've been hanging around rabbits too long.
W-Whoop! Whoop!
W-w-
Oh, excuse me!
Please, help. Oh, I'm sorry.
Get out of my way!
Oh, taxi? Oh, cab?
Right here! Right here!
What do I look like, a bank?
Wait for me!
- Come on!
- Guys, wait up!
- Come on, hurry up! Come on, Sig!
- Hurry up!
- Hey, mister, ain't you got a car?
- Who needs a car in L.A.?
We got the best public transportation system in the world.
- Hey, so long.
- See you later!
- So long, mister!
- Thanks for the cigarettes.
- You bet.
- Anytime.
- Hi, Harry.
- Hey, Eddie. How's it going?
Okay. What you got for me?
The usual bills.
Hey, give back my ball!
Hello, fella.
- Hi, Harry. Are you okay?
- Hey.
What's with Earl?
- Laid off?
- A new outfit bought the Red Car.
Some big company called Cloverleaf.
No kiddin'. They bought the Red Car?
Yeah, and put the poor guy on two weeks' notice. Cutbacks, they said.
Oh, well.
Here's to the pencil pushers.
May they all get lead poisoning?
Tomorrow's Friday, Eddie. You know what happens here on Friday?
- Fish special?
- My boss checks the books on Friday.
And if I don't have that money
I gave you back in the till,
I'm gonna lose my job.
Don't bust a button, Dolores.
You've only got one left.
50 bucks?
Where's the rest?
Well, it's only a snoop job away.
You got that camera of yours?
Mine's in the shop.
Wouldn't be the pawn shop by any chance, would it?
Oh, come on, Dolores.
You need the other 50.
I need the camera.
Any film in there?
Should be.
I haven't had that roll developed since our trip to Catalina.
- That sure was a long time ago.
- Yeah, that was a long time ago.
- Let's do that again sometime.
- Yeah, sure, Eddie.
- That paper even good?
- Just check the scrawl.
R. K. Maroon, as in Maroon Cartoons?
Maroon Cartoons?
Hey. So who's your client,
Mr. Detective-To-The-Stars?
Chilly Willy?
Or Screwy Squirrel?
- What do you want to drink?
- I'll take a beer, doll.
So what happened?
Somebody kidnap Dinky Doodle?
Cut it out, Angelo.
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute. I know.
You're working for Little Bo Peep.
She's lost her sheep and you're gonna help her find them.
Hey?
Get this straight, meatball.
I don't work for Toons!
So what's his problem?
- A Toon killed his brother.
- What?
Dropped a piano on his head.
Got the password?
Walt sent me.
- Nice monkey suit.
- Wiseass.
All right.
Hey, look at that!
Hey! Hey! Cut it out!
Does anybody understand what this duck is saying?
- Most amusing.
- A little more wine.
I've worked with a lot of wise quackers, but you are despicable.
Doggone stubborn nitwit!
That did it!
This is the last time I work with someone with a speech impediment.
Oh, yeah?
This means war.
- What, you think that's funny?
- It's a panic.
You won't think it's funny when I stick that pen up your nose.
Now, calm down, son, will ya? Look, the stain's gone. It's disappearing ink.
No hard feelings, I hope.
- Look, I'm... I'm...
- I know who you are.
Marvin Acme, the guy that owns Toontown. The gag king.
If it's Acme, it's a gasser.
Put it there, pal.
The hand buzzer.
It's still our biggest seller.
Scotch on the rocks.
And I mean ice!
This is hot stuff!
Hey, those ducks are funny.
They never get to finish the act!
Great. Thanks.
- Toons.
- Cigars? Cigarettes?
- Eddie Valiant!
- Betty?
Long time no see.
What are you doing here?
Work's been kinda slow since cartoons went to color.
But I still got it, Eddie.
Boop-boop-be-doop, boop!
Yeah, you still got it.
What's with him?
Mr. Acme never misses a night when Jessica performs.
Got a thing for rabbits?
You had plenty money
In 1922
You let other women
Make a fool of you
Why don't you do right
Like some other men do?
Get out of here
Give me some money too
She's married to Roger Rabbit?
Yeah. What a lucky girl.
Now if you had prepared
20 years ago
You wouldn't be wanderin' now
From door to door
Why don't you do right
Like some other men do?
Get out of here
Give me some money too
Get out of here
Give me some money too
Why don't you do right
Like some other men
Do?
Who is it?
Jessica, dear, have no fear.
Your Marvin is here.
You sure murdered 'em again tonight, baby.
I really mean it.
My darling, you were superb.
You absolutely, truly and honestly
"fashmolyed" that audience.
You killed them. You slayed them.
You belted them into little pieces.
What do you think you're doin', chump?
Who are you callin' a chump, chimp?
And don't let me catch your peepin' face around here again!
Got it?
Ooga-booga!
Come, my dear Jessica.
Come over here.
I got everything arranged, right here on the bed.
Oh, not tonight, Marvin.
I have a headache.
Oh, Jessica, you promised.
Oh, all right.
But this time, take off that hand buzzer.
Patty-cake.
Patty-cake.
- Patty-cake. Patty-cake.
- Oh, Marvin.
Patty-cake.
- Marvin.
- Patty-cake.
- Patty-cake. Patty-cake.
- Oh, Marvin!
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Patty-cake! Patty-cake!
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!
I don't believe it!
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!
Is that true?
Take comfort, son.
You're not the first man whose wife played patty-cake on him.
I just don't believe it.
I won't believe it. I can't believe it.
I shan't believe it.
Believe it, kid.
I took the pictures myself.
She played patty-cake.
No, not my Jessica. Not patty-cake.
This is impossible.
I don't believe it. It can't be!
It just can't be! Jessica's my wife!
It's absolutely impossible!
Jessica's the light of my life, the apple of my eye, the cream in my coffee!
You better start drinking it black,
'cause Acme's taking the cream now.
Hard to believe. Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for 30 years.
Who would've thought he was a sugar daddy?
Somebody must have made her do it!
Now drink this, son.
It'll make you feel better.
Thanks. I needed that.
Son of a bitch.
Look, Mr. Maroon.
I think my work here is finished.
How about that carrot you owe me?
- A deal's a deal.
- Great.
Thanks.
Roger, I know all this seems pretty painful now, but you'll find someone new.
- Won't he, Mr. Valiant?
- Yeah, sure.
Good-looking guy like that.
The dames will be breaking his door down.
Dames? What dames?
Jessica is the only one for me!
You'll see! We'll rise above this piddling peccadillo!
We're going to be happy again!
You got that? Happy.
Capital H-A-P-P-I...
Well, at least he took it well.
Oh, Jessica!
Please tell me it's not true.
P-p-please!
Oh, Lieutenant Santino.
Where'd you come from?
Gee whiz, Eddie. If you needed money so bad, why didn't you come to me?
So I took a couple of dirty pictures. So kill me.
I already got a stiff on my hands, thank you.
Marvin Acme.
The rabbit cacked him last night.
What?
Now what?
It's just I haven't been this close to Toontown for a while.
Yeeow!
My biscuits are burnin'!
Fire in the hatch!
Eee! Great horny toads, that smarts!
Come on, Eddie.
Let's get this over with.
I didn't see anything.
Maybe you heard a noise or something.
- He's with me.
- Nothin'.
- Are you sure?
- Come on, kid.
Are you sure you didn't see anything?
- What about you, fella?
- I didn't see anything.
- I came in to work.
- Come on, Lieutenant.
Just like a Toon to drop a safe on a guy's head.
Sorry, Eddie.
You better wait here, all right?
You got a positive I. D.?
Must be.
Hey, Chisold, get a load of this.
You've seen one of these?
- Yeah.
- Hey, guys.
Didn't you used to be Eddie Valiant?
Or did you change your name to Jack Daniels?
- What's that?
- Paint from the rabbit's glove.
Mr. Valiant?
I hope you're proud of yourself and those pictures you took.
For crying out loud, Mike!
Hey, we need a little help over here!
Hey, somebody grab those loafers!
Hey, Mike, come here!
I got these. Come on. Come on.
Those shoes over there.
Is this man removing evidence from the scene of a crime?
No, Judge Doom. Valiant here was just pickin' it up for you.
Weren't you, Eddie?
- Hand it over.
- Sure.
His number-one seller.
I see working for a Toon has rubbed off on you.
I wasn't working for a Toon.
I was working for R. K. Maroon.
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.
He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures.
The rabbit said, one way or another, he and his wife were going to be happy.
Is that true?
Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?
Shut your yap, Eddie.
The man's in charge.
That's all right, Lieutenant.
From the smell of him,
I'd say it was the booze talking.
No matter. The rabbit won't get far.
My men will find him.
Look out!
- Weasels?
- Yes.
I find they have a special gift for the work.
All right, ya mugs. Fall out.
- Did you find the rabbit?
- Don't worry, Judge.
We've got "deformants" all over the city. We'll find him.
You wouldn't have any idea where the rabbit might be, Mr. Valiant?
Have you tried Walla Walla?
Cucamonga?
I hear Kokomo's very nice this time of the year.
I'm surprised you're not more cooperative, Mr. Valiant.
A human has been murdered by a Toon.
Don't you appreciate the magnitude of that?
Since I've had Toontown under my jurisdiction, my goal has been to reign in the insanity.
And the only way to do that is to make Toons respect the law.
How did that gargoyle get to be a judge?
He spread a bunch of simoleons around Toontown a couple years back, bought the election.
Yeah? What's that?
Remember how we always thought there wasn't a way to kill a Toon?
- Yeah.
- Well, Doom found a way.
Turpentine, acetone, benzene.
- He calls it "the dip."
- I'll catch the rabbit, Mr. Valiant.
Then I'll try him, convict him and execute him.
That's one dead shoe, boss?
They're not kid gloves, Mr. Valiant.
But this is how we handle things down in Toontown.
I'd think you, of all people, would appreciate that.
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey!
Hey, wait a minute! Hey, hey!
I've been tryin' to make him quit, but he just won't listen to me.
What do you know, you dumb broad?
You got the I.Q. of a rattle.
- You Valiant?
- Yeah.
I wanna talk to you about the Acme murder. Hey, doll.
Why don't you run downstairs and get me a racin' form?
Okay, okay. I'm goin'.
The lady's man?
My problem is I got a 50-year-old lust in a 3-year-old dinky.
Yeah, must be tough.
Look, Valiant, the rabbit didn't kill Acme.
He's not a murderer. I should know.
He's a dear friend of mine.
I tell ya, Valiant, the whole thing stinks like yesterday's diapers.
Look at this.
The paper said Acme left no will.
That's a load of succotash.
Every Toon knows Acme had a will.
He promised to leave Toontown to us Toons.
That will is the reason he got bumped off.
Has anybody ever seen this will?
No, but he gave us his solemn oath.
If you believe that that joker could do anything solemn, the gag's on you, pal.
I just figured since you were the one who got my pal in trouble, you might want to help get him out.
I can pay you.
Save your money for a pair of elevator shoes!
Wait, no! Valiant, no! Oh, my stogie!
It ain't my fault the rabbit got himself in trouble.
All I did was take a couple of lousy pictures.
Baby was right.
The hell with it.
- How the hell did you get in here?
- Through the mail slot.
I thought it would be best if I waited inside, seein' as how I'm wanted for murder!
No kiddin'. Just talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
Wait a minute.
Anybody know you're here?
Nobody. Not a soul except...
- Who?
- Well, you see...
I didn't know where your office was, so I asked the newsboy.
He didn't know, so I asked the fireman, the green grocer, the butcher, the baker.
They didn't know.
But the liquor store guy, he knew.
In other words, the whole damn town knows you're here!
- Get out of here! Come on. Out!
- Hey, take it easy, will ya?
- Out! Get out! Come on.
- Please, Eddie, don't throw me out!
- You're making a big mistake!
- Get out of here!
- I didn't kill anybody! I swear!
- Let go of that door, will ya?
This whole thing's a setup, a scam, a frame job.
Eddie, I could never hurt anybody.
My whole purpose in life is to make people laugh!
Okay, okay. Sure, I admit it.
I got a little steamed when you showed me those pictures of Jessica, so I rushed over to the Ink and Paint Club.
But she wasn't in her dressing room, so I wrote her a love letter.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You're telling me, in a fit of jealousy, you wrote your wife a love letter?
That's right. I know that she was just an innocent victim of circumstance.
I suppose you used the old lipstick on the mirror routine?
Lipstick, yes. Mirror, no.
I found a nice, clean piece of paper.
"Dear Jessica, how do I love thee?
Let me count the ways."
"One-one thousand, two-one thousand, three-one thousand..."
Why didn't you just leave the letter there?
Obviously, a poem of this power and sensitivity must... be read in person, so I went home to wait for her.
But the weasels were there, waiting for me.
So... So I ran.
So why come to me? I'm the guy that took the pictures of your wife.
Yeah, and you're also the guy that helped all these Toons.
Everybody knows, when a Toon's in trouble, there's only one place to go,
Valiant and Valiant.
Not anymore.
Get out of that chair!
- That's my brother's chair.
- Yeah. Where is your brother anyway?
He looks like a sensitive and sober fellow.
- That's it. I'm callin' the cops.
- Go ahead. Call the cops.
I come here for help, and what do you do?
You turn me in.
No, no, don't feel guilty about me.
So long, and thanks for nothin'.
That's the closet! Stupe.
Eddie Valiant, you're under arrest.
Get out!
Idiot. I got no keys for these cuffs.
Yah!
Come on. Get the lead out.
Move it, would ya? Move it!
Yah! It's the Toon Patrol!
Hide me, Eddie. P-p-please!
- Remember. You never saw me.
- Get out of there!
Don't let 'em find me!
Come on, Eddie. You're my only hope.
Open up in the name of the law!
- That's us.
- P-p-please, Eddie.
You know there's no justice for Toons anymore.
- If the weasels get their hands on me...
- Are you in there?
- I'm as good as dipped.
- Don't make us play rough, Valiant.
We just want the rabbit.
What are we gonna do, Eddie?
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?
What's all this "we" stuff?
They just want the rabbit.
It looks like they gave us the slip, boss?
Nah. Valiant's got him stashed somewhere.
Hold it right there.
Hello, boys. I didn't hear you come in.
Okay, wise guy. Where's the rabbit?
I haven't seen him.
- What's in there?
- My lingerie.
Sheesh, Valiant.
Search the place, boys.
And leave no stone unturned.
Look, Valiant, we got a reliable tip-off the rabbit was here, and it was "corrugated" by several others.
So cut the "bullshtick."
You keep talkin' like that, and
I'm gonna have to wash your mouth out.
Stop that laughin'!
You know what happens when ya can't stop laughin'!
One of these days, you're gonna die laughin'.
As for you, Valiant, step out of line, and we'll hang you and your laundry out to dry.
Come on, boys. Let's "am-scray."
- They're gone.
- Jeepers, Eddie, that was swell.
You saved my life.
How can I ever repay ya?
Blecch! For starters, don't ever kiss me again!
Stop kicking me. Stop kicking me.
Dolores. Dolores!
Dolores!
Hey, Eddie, you made the front page today.
- Yeah, I guess I made some ink.
- And what ink.
Come on, Eddie. Just let's go. Please!
So tell me, Eddie.
Is that a rabbit in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?
Cut the comedy, Dolores.
I've had a very hard day.
- I gotta get out of these cuffs.
- Oh, swell.
Jeepers, Eddie, that almost killed me!
Boy, what is this?
Some kind of a secret room?
It's a rotgut room.
A holdover from Prohibition.
Oh, I get it. A speakeasy, a gin mill, a hooch parlor.
- Tools are up here, Eddie.
- Look at this!
It's a spy hole!
Jeepers, Eddie!
This would be a great place to hide!
- Crazy Toon.
- Watch your head!
I thought you said you'd never take another Toon case.
- What'd you have, a change of heart?
- Nothing's changed.
Somebody's made a patsy out of me, and I'm going to find out why.
Hold still, will ya?
- Does this help?
- Yeah. Thanks.
You mean to tell me that you could have taken your hand out of that cuff at any time?
No, not at any time.
Only when it was funny.
Get out!
Come on, Eddie.
Where's your sense of humor?
He always this funny, or only on days when he's wanted for murder?
Listen, my philosophy is this.
If you don't have a good sense of humor, you're better off dead.
You just may get your wish unless
I can figure out what happened to this.
- What is it, Eddie?
- Just look at it.
- Mr. Acme's will.
- Yeah.
And I think Maroon played the part of sound mind and your wife the sound body.
Why, I resent that innuendo!
- What's the scheme, Eddie?
- I don't think they got to the will.
But how do you know?
Because they were still looking for it after they killed him.
Anything I can do?
Maybe you can go downtown and check the probate.
Yeah, check the probate!
Why, my Uncle Thumper had a problem with his probate, and he had to take these big pills and drink lots of water.
- Not prostate, you idiot. Probate!
- Let me get this straight.
You think that my boss, R. K. Maroon dropped a safe on Marvin Acme's head so that he could get his hands on Toontown?
Yeah.
That's my hunch.
Can he stay here for a couple of days?
He's not gonna do anything crazy, is he?
- Where are you going?
- Back to the office.
Mr. Valiant. Mr. Valiant?
You've got the wrong idea about me, Mr. Valiant.
I'm a pawn in this, just like Roger.
Can you help me find him?
Just name your price and I'll pay it.
Yeah, I bet you would.
You've gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
No, no, no. I love my husband.
You've got me all wrong.
You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
Yeah, well.
You don't know how hard it is being a man looking at a woman, looking the way you do.
I'm not bad. I'm just drawn that way.
Weren't you the one I caught playing patty-cake with old man Acme?
You didn't catch me, Mr. Valiant.
You were set up to take those pictures.
- What are you talking about?
- Maroon wanted to blackmail Acme.
I didn't want to have anything to do with it, but he said if I didn't pose for those patty-cake pictures,
Roger would never work in this town again.
I couldn't let that happen.
I'd do anything for my husband, Mr. Valiant.
- Anything.
- What a wife.
I'm desperate, Mr. Valiant.
Can't you see how much I need you?
Dabblin' in watercolors, Eddie?
Well.
Sorry.
Good-bye, Eddie. My offer stands firm.
Think about it.
Well!
Do you want to tell me what she was doing with her arms around you?
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
Come on, Eddie.
I caught you with your pants down!
Yeah, but I... Dolores, come...
Come on, Dolores.
You don't believe a painted hussy like that could turn my head.
She's just trying to get her hands on the rabbit.
That's not all she's trying to get her hands on.
Now, look, Dolores, listen.
Listen to me.
Look, I want you to go out, I want you to buy yourself a new swim suit,
'cause you and me are going to Catalina.
I'm on the verge of wrappin' up this case.
No, you're not, Eddie.
That's what I came to tell you.
I stopped by Probate.
Maroon's not after Toontown like you thought.
It's Cloverleaf that wants to get their hands on Toontown.
They put in the highest bid.
And unless Mr. Acme's will shows up by midnight tonight,
Cloverleaf is gonna own Toontown.
- What? At midnight tonight?
- That's right.
First they buy the Red Car, then they want to get their hands on Toontown.
I don't get it.
Yes!
Roger!
The rabbit. Get the judge.
A joke don't sit there on your brain
Nice shirt.
Who's your tailor, Quasimodo?
My buddy's Eddie V
A sourpuss, you'll see
But when I'm done he'll need no gun
'cause a joker he will be
C, D, E, F, G
H, I... I would love to raise some Cain
Believe me, it's no strain
It feels so great 'cause I'm so tight
And look, there is no pain
No pain. No pain. No pain
No pain. No pain. No...
- No!
- Hey, wait!
Yah!
Hey, who turned out the lights?
I can't see a thing! What's goin' on?
You crazy rabbit!
I've been out there risking my neck for you, and what are you doin'?
Singin' and dancin'!
But I'm a Toon. Toons are supposed to make people laugh.
Sit down!
You don't understand.
Those people needed to laugh.
Yeah, and when they're done laughin', they'll call the cops!
That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel.
Not Angelo! He'd never turn me in.
Why? Because you made him laugh?
That's right.
A laugh can be a very powerful thing.
Why, sometimes in life, it's the only weapon we have.
Laughter is the most...
"Ixnay." "Ix-nay."
I'm looking for a murderer.
A rabbit.
A Toon rabbit.
About yea big.
Look.
There's no rabbit here, so don't harass my customers.
I didn't come here to harass.
I came here to reward.
Hey. I seen a rabbit.
Where?
See?
- Where?
- He's right here in the bar.
Say "hello," Harvey.
I told you so.
The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down.
Quite a loony selection for a group of drunken reprobates.
He's here!
Stop that laughing!
Have you forgotten what happened last time?
If you don't stop this laughing, you're gonna end up dead, just like your idiot hyena cousins!
Say, boss, you want we should
"disresemble" the place?
No, Sergeant. Disassembling the place won't be necessary.
The rabbit is going to come right to me.
No Toon can resist the old Shave and a Haircut trick.
I don't know who's toonier, you or Doom.
Roger!
Ro... Roger.
Roger, no!
Roger, don't...
Shave and a haircut
Two bits
Hey, Judge, what should we do with the wallflower?
We'll see to him later.
Right now I feel like dispensing some justice.
Bring me some dip.
Does the condemned have anything to say before his sentence is carried out?
Why, yeah. I...
Dolores, a bourbon, and make it a double.
A fine time for a drink, Eddie.
Maybe you'd like a bowl of pretzels to go with it!
Pour the drink, Dolores.
Hey, Judge!
Doesn't a dying rabbit deserve a last request?
Yeah! Nose plugs would be nice.
I think you want a drink.
- How 'bout it, Judge?
- Well, why not.
I don't mind prolonging the execution.
Happy trails.
No, thanks, Eddie.
I'm tryin' to cut down.
- Drink the drink!
- But I don't want the drink.
He doesn't want the drink.
- He does! You do!
- I don't!
- I don't! I don't!
- You do!
- You do! You don't.
- I don't!
- I do!
- You don't!
Listen, when I say "I do," that means I do!
Come on.
Gotcha, kid.
Come on, Eddie, let's get out of here!
Move it, pops! Yikes!
That was quick thinkin', Eddie.
Nothing like using the old spine flower,
- the wise noodle, the smart puddin'.
- Roger!
- Yikes! Stop, will ya?
- Let's use this!
Yah!
Let's get out of here!
What are you waitin' for?
There's no damn key!
Hey, you weasels, let me out of here, will ya? Come on!
- I've got to make a livin'!
- Benny, is that you?
No, it's Eleanor Roosevelt.
Come on, Roger! Get me out of here!
Eddie, we got ourselves a ride!
Open the doors!
That's better.
I can't believe they locked me up for driving on the sidewalk.
Come on, Eddie. Get in!
- It was just a couple of miles.
- I'll drive!
- But I wanna drive!
- No, I'll drive!
I'm the cab. Out of my way, pencil neck!
How about this weather?
- It never rains!
- Would you beat it!
They've sprung the cab! Let's go!
And how about those
Brooklyn Dodgers?
Are they bums, or what?
Move over. I'm drivin'!
Benny, Eddie, we got company!
Will you look at these two?
Excuse me, ladies!
Now that's what I call a couple of road hogs.
- I'm gonna blow his head off.
- Benny, look out for the Red Car!
Benny, there's cops right behind us!
Not for long, Roger.
- No!
- Now they're right in front of us.
Eddie, we're goin' backwards.
Turn us around.
Give me the wheel. Give me the wheel!
- The cops are still on our tail!
- I know the cops are on our tail!
What do you think I am? Benny!
No. No!
Pull the lever!
- Which one?
- Which one?
Which one?
I'm gonna ram 'em.
What the heck?
I'm gettin' too old for this!
Jumpin' jeepers!
Hey, Roger, what do you call the middle of a song?
I don't know. A bridge!
- Well, fellas, where can I drop ya?
- Yeah. Somewhere we can hide.
I got just the place. And incidentally, if you should ever need a ride, just stick out your thumb.
Hey, share the road, will ya, lady?
Well, that wasn't so bad, was it?
Boy, did you see that?
Nobody takes a wallop like Goofy.
What timing, what finesse!
What a genius!
Ouch!
We're supposed to be hiding.
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
You're the only person in this theater that isn't laughing.
Is there nothing that can permeate your impervious puss?
Hey, Eddie! Boy, nothin'.
What could've possibly happened to you to turn you into such a sourpuss?
You want to know? I'll tell you.
- A Toon killed my brother.
- A Toon? No.
That's right. A Toon.
We were investigating a robbery at the First National Bank of Toontown.
Back in those days, me and Teddy liked working Toontown.
We thought it was a lot of laughs.
Anyway, this guy got away with a zillion simoleons.
We trailed him to a little dive down on Yockster Street.
We went in.
Only he got the drop on us, literally.
Dropped a piano on us from 15 stories.
Broke my arm.
Teddy never made it.
I never did find out who that guy was.
All I remember was, he was standin' over me, laughin', with those burnin' red eyes and that high, squeaky voice.
He disappeared into Toontown after that.
No wonder you hate me.
If a Toon killed my brother,
I'd hate me too!
Come on, don't cry. I don't hate you.
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.
You do hate me.
Otherwise you wouldn't have yanked my ears all those times.
Well, I'm sorry I yanked your ears.
All the times you yanked my ears?
- All the times I yanked your ears.
- Apology accepted.
Put 'er there, pal. I feel better. Oh, boy!
I hope it's another cartoon!
Jeepers, another stupid newsreel.
I hate the news.
- Did you get all my stuff?
- Yes.
It's all packed up in the car outside.
Would have been here right after you called, but I had to shake the weasels.
Yeah. I'm sorry about the trouble in the bar.
Oh, hell. Stuffing olives for a living wasn't for me anyway.
Dolores?
You oughta find yourself a good man.
But I already have a good man.
P-p-please, don't mind me.
You better get going, Eddie.
A near miss, but this miss says that's as good as a smile.
California Cloverleaf...
Glad Teddy's not here to see me running away with my tail between my legs.
It's not so bad once you get used to it.
The Pacific Red Car trolley line and the venerated
Maroon Cartoon Studios.
Here, R.K. Maroon is seen clinching the deal with Cloverleaf's bankers and execs in one of the biggest real estate deals ever in California history.
- That's it!
- Three-and-a-half million dollars...
That's the connection!
Let's forget it.
There's nobody here.
- Is that it, or are you scared?
- P-p-please! Me, scared?
Don't be ridiculous.
When you called Maroon, you told him you had the will, but you don't.
When he finds out, he's gonna be mad.
He might try to kill ya.
I can handle a Hollywood cream puff.
I just don't want the odds to change.
Now, you cover my back.
And if you hear or see anything, beep the horn twice.
Yeah, that's it. Beep the horn twice.
Cover your back.
Boy, I'm ready. Dukes up, eyes peeled, ears to the ground.
Why, nobody gets the drop on Roger Rabbit.
What's up, Doc?
Valiant, what are you trying to do, give me a heart attack?
You need a heart before you can have an attack.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You got the will?
Sure. I got the will.
The question is, do you have the way?
'Cause I can tell you now, it ain't gonna come cheap.
You got a lot of brass coming up here by yourself.
Who said I'm here by myself?
Let me see that will.
- I told you, I got it.
- I want to see it now!
"How do I love thee?
Let me count the ways"?
- This supposed to be a joke?
- No, this is.
Get up! Come on.
What are you gonna do to me, Valiant?
I'm gonna listen to you spin the Cloverleaf scenario.
A story of greed, sex and murder.
And the parts that I don't like,
I'm gonna edit out.
You got it all wrong!
I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer!
Everybody's got to have a hobby.
Oh, stop it. Stop it! Stop it!
The truth is, I had a chance to sell my studio, but Cloverleaf wouldn't buy my property unless Acme sold them his.
The stubborn bastard wouldn't sell, so I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.
Blackmail, that's all!
I've been around Toons all my life!
- I didn't want to see 'em destroyed!
- Toons destroyed? Why?
- If I tell ya, I'm a dead man.
- You're a dead man if you don't tell me.
Unless Acme's will shows by midnight tonight,
Toontown's going to be live for the free...
Roger!
- What the...
- Yeah, what in Sam Hill...
Eddie Valiant!
Well, you're a sight for sore eyes!
I ain't seen you in nigh on to five years.
- Where've you been?
- Drunk.
- You feeling frisky tonight, fellas?
- Yeah!
Let's go.
Yahoo!
Smile, darn ya, smile
You know, this old world is a great world after all
Smile, darn ya, smile
And right away watch lady luck pay you a call
Things are never black as they are painted
Time for you and joy to get acquainted
Hi, Eddie!
Hi, Eddie! Hi, Eddie! Bye, Eddie!
Tallyho! Tallyho!
Get out of here!
Going up, sir.
Yah!
Mind the step, sir.
Hold on, sir.
Yah!
Your floor, sir.
Have a good day, sir.
Gotcha.
A man!
Lover boy! It's Lena Hyena!
Oh, no!
- Oh, "wook," piggies.
- Hi, Tweety.
This "wittle" piggy went to market.
This "wittle" piggy stayed home.
- No.
- This "wittle" piggy had roast beef.
And this "wittle" piggy had...
Ran out of piggies.
Yah!
What's up, Doc? Jumpin' without a parachute? Kinda dangerous, ain't it?
Yeah.
Yeah. You could get killed.
- You guys got a spare?
- Bugs does.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, but I don't think you want it.
- I do! I do! Give it to me!
- Better let him have it, Bugs.
Okay, Doc. Whatever you say.
Here's the spare.
Thank you.
No!
- Poor fella.
- Yeah. Ain't I a stinker?
My man!
Come to Lena!
Toons. Gets 'em every time.
- Gesundheit.
- Thank you.
Valiant?
I always knew I'd get it in Toontown.
Behind you!
Drop it, lady!
I just saved your life, and you still don't trust me?
- I don't trust anybody or anything!
- Not even your own eyes?
That's the gun that killed R. K. Maroon, and Doom pulled the trigger.
- Doom?
- I followed him to the studio, but I was too late to stop him.
That's right!
You'll never stop me!
- You're dead! You're both dead!
- Doom!
- Which way'd he go?
- Well, I don't know.
- Well, he went that-a-way.
- Let's go!
Dum-dums.
- Come on.
- Yeah.
- Oh, no. Where's Roger?
- Roger?
He chickened out on me back at the studio.
No, he didn't.
I hit him on the head with a frying pan and put him in the trunk so he wouldn't get hurt.
Makes perfect sense.
We're obviously not going anywhere in my car.
Let's take yours.
I got a feeling somebody already did.
From the looks of it,
I'd say it was Roger.
My honey bunny was never very good behind the wheel.
- A better lover than a driver?
- You'd better believe it, buster.
It's the weasels. This way!
- We'll take Gingerbread Lane.
- No, wait! No, no!
Gingerbread Lane's this way.
So, Valiant, you call a cab, or what?
Hubba-hubba-hubba.
Allow me, mademoiselle.
So how long have you known it was Doom?
Before poor Marvin Acme was killed, he confided in me that Doom wanted to get his hands on Toontown, and he wouldn't stop at anything.
So he gave you the will for safekeeping.
That's what he told me.
Except when I opened the envelope, there was only a blank piece of paper inside.
- A joker to the end.
- So where to, already?
- My meter's runnin'!
- I have to find my darling husband.
I'm so worried about him.
Seriously, what do you see in that guy?
He makes me laugh.
I've been dipped!
What an unfortunate accident. Nothing more treacherous than a slippery road especially when driving in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
Good work, boss.
Don't just stand there. Help them.
- Put them in my car.
- Follow me.
And I think they'll enjoy attending the ribbon cutting at the Acme Factory.
Come on, you mugs.
We searched Valiant, boss.
The will ain't on him.
- Then frisk the woman!
- I'll handle this one.
Nice booby trap.
Do they have the will, or not?
- Nah, just a stupid love letter.
- No matter.
I doubt if that will is gonna show up in the next 15 minutes anyway.
- What happens in the next 15 minutes?
- Toontown will be legally mine.
Lock, stock and barrel.
Benny, is that you?
No, it's Shirley Temple!
Jumpin' jeepers! What happened?
Doom grabbed your wife and Valiant and took 'em to the Acme Factory.
The Acme Factory?
I know where that is. Get in!
Move over, Rog. You've done enough driving for one night.
Toontown right on the other side of the wall, boss.
You see, Mr. Valiant, the successful conclusion of this case draws the curtains on my career as a jurist in Toontown.
I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.
That wouldn't be Cloverleaf
Industries by any chance?
You're looking at the sole stockholder.
Benny, you go for the cops.
I'm gonna save my wife.
Be careful with that gun.
This ain't no cartoon, you know.
This is no way to make a livin'.
Wouldn't you know. Locked.
Can you guess what this is?
Oh, my God! It's dip!
That's right, my dear. Enough to dip
Toontown off the face of the Earth!
A vehicle of my own design.
5,000 gallons of heated dip pumped at enormous velocity through a pressurized water cannon.
Toontown will be erased in a matter of minutes.
I suppose you think no one's going to notice
Toontown's disappeared?
Who's got time to wonder what happened to some ridiculous talking mice when you're driving by at 75 miles an hour?
What are you talking about?
There's no road past Toontown.
Not yet! Several months ago,
I had the good providence to stumble upon this plan of the city council's.
A construction plan of epic proportions.
They're calling it a freeway.
Freeway? What the hell's a freeway?
Eight lanes of shimmering cement running from here to Pasadena.
Smooth, safe, fast.
Traffic jams will be a thing of the past.
So that's why you killed
Acme and Maroon? For this freeway?
- I don't get it.
- Of course not. You lack vision.
I see a place where people get on and off the freeway.
On and off, off and on, all day and all night!
Soon, where Toontown once stood will be a string of gas stations, inexpensive motels, restaurants that serve rapidly prepared food, tire salons, automobile dealerships, and wonderful, wonderful billboards reaching as far as the eye can see!
- My God, it'll be beautiful.
- Come on!
Nobody's gonna drive this lousy freeway when they can take the Red Car for a nickel.
Oh, they'll drive. They'll have to.
You see, I bought the Red Car so I could dismantle it.
What the...
Ay, caramba!
Okay, nobody move!
All right, weasels, grab some sky or I'll let the judge have it!
- You heard me. I said, drop it.
- Roger, darling!
Yes, it's me, my dearest.
I'd love to embrace you, but first I have to satisfy my sense of moral outrage!
Put the gun down, you bucktoothed fool!
That's it, Doom! Give me another excuse to pump you full of lead!
You thought you could get away with it, didn't ya?
We Toons may act idiotic, but we're not stupid!
We demand justice, but the real meaning of the word probably hits you like a ton of bricks!
Roger!
- Roger, say something!
- Look, stars!
Ready when you are, Raoul.
Tie the lovebirds together.
Come on, lovebirds. What you want?
Put them up on that hook.
Use that escape-proof Toon rope.
Time to kill the rabbit.
Oh, Roger, you were magnificent.
- Was I really?
- Better than Goofy.
Roger, darling,
I want you to know I love you.
I've loved you more than any woman's ever loved a rabbit.
It's over, Mr. Valiant.
- Look out, you fools!
- Not so fast.
One of these days, you idiots are gonna laugh yourselves to death!
Shall I "repose" of him right now, boss?
Let him watch his Toon friends get dipped, then shoot him.
With pleasure.
Everything's funny to you, ain't it, needle nose?
You got a problem with that, Valiant?
Nah.
I just want you to know something about the guy you're gonna dip!
Now Roger is his name
Laughter is his game
Come on, you dope, untie his rope and watch him go insane
- He's lost his mind.
- I don't think so.
This singing ain't my line
It's tough to make a rhyme
If I get stuck
I'm... I'm out of luck...
- I'm running out of time!
- Thanks!
Hey, Eddie, keep it up!
You're killin' 'em!
You're slayin' 'em!
You're knockin' 'em dead!
I'm through with taking falls
I'm bouncing off the walls
Without that gun I'd have some fun
I'd kick you in the...
- Nose!
- Nose? That don't rhyme with "walls"!
No, but this does!
Yikes! Oh, my goodness!
Jeepers, that was close!
Bye-bye!
Eddie, hurry! It's coming back!
- Oh, no!
- This is it!
This isn't it!
Wicked witchcraft
And although I know
It's strictly taboo
When...
Don't move.
No. No!
Yah!
Oh, no!
Come on, Eddie! Quit playing around!
- P-p-please!
- Help!
I wasn't worried. Were you?
- Hey, look!
- Hey, look!
Holy smoke! He's a Toon!
- Surprised?
- Not really.
That lamebrain freeway idea could only be cooked up by a Toon.
Not just any Toon!
Remember me, Eddie?
When I killed your brother, I talked just like this!
Jumpin' jeepers.
Oh, my goodness! Oh, no!
Good-bye, my darling. Good-bye!
I think I'm gonna faint.
Oh, no!
I'm melting!
I'm melting! Melting!
Eddie! Do something!
Hurry up, Eddie!
Do something!
Eddie, there's dip everywhere!
How are we gonna get down?
Jeepers, Eddie, that was a close shave.
I thought for sure our goose was cooked!
My hero.
- Oh, honey bunny.
- Oh, love cup.
Oh, Roger, you were a pillar of strength.
Sister Mary Francis!
What the hell happened in here?
I've been a cab for 37 years and I've never seen a mess like this!
What was that, a rubber mask?
Yeah.
And this is the rope from the safe that was dropped on Acme.
I think your lab boys will find that paint's a perfect match.
- Judge Doom killed Marvin Acme.
- And R. K. Maroon.
And my brother.
That's what I call one seriously disturbed Toon.
I wonder who he really was.
I'll tell you one thing, Doc.
He weren't no rabbit.
- Or a duck.
- Or a dog.
- Or a little wooden boy.
- Or a sheep.
- Or a woodpecker.
- Or a pussy.
- What's that? What is that?
- It's ink.
That goof Acme squirted me with some the other night.
- Why it's coming out now, I don't know.
- Here's your answer, Eddie.
Acme Disappearing Reappearing Ink.
- Boy, that Acme. What a genius!
- Applesauce!
If he was such a genius, why didn't he leave his will where we could find it?
Without it, we're just waitin' for another developer's wrecking ball!
- Roger.
- Yeah?
That love letter you wrote to your wife in the Ink and Paint Club.
Why don't you read it to her now?
Sure, Eddie.
"Dear Jessica, how do I love thee?"
"Let me count the ways. I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body..."
- It's the will!
- Give me!
"Do hereby bequeath in perpetuity"
"the property known as Toontown"
"to those lovable characters, the Toons!"
Hey, Eddie, that was a pretty funny dance you did for the weasels.
Do you think your days of being a sourpuss are over?
- Only time will tell.
- Yeah. Well, put it there, pal.
Yeah.
Don't tell me you lost your sense of humor already.
Does this answer your question?
Blech! Bleah!
Come on, Roger, let's go home.
I'll bake you a carrot cake.
Smile, darn ya, smile
You know, this old world is a great world after all
Smile, darn ya, smile
And right away watch lady luck pay you a call
Things are never black as they are painted
Time for you and joy to get acquainted
Okay, m-m-move along.
T-T-There's nothing else to see.
That's all, folks.
I like the sound of that.
T-T-T-T-That's all, folks!
Orbilus, look! It's Unicron!
The ships! Get to the ships!
It's our only chance!
Kranix! Ahh!
It is the year 2005.
The treacherous decepticons have conquered the autobots' home planet of Cybertron.
But from secret staging grounds on two of Cybertron's moons the valiant autobots prepare to retake their homeland.
Ironhide, report to me at once.
Every time I look into a monitor, Prime, my circuits sizzle.
When are we gonna start busting decepti-chops?
I want you to make a special run to Autobot City on Earth.
- But, Prime--
- listen, Ironhide, we don't have enough energon cubes to power a full-scale assault.
Ready the shuttle for launch!
Your days are numbered now, decepti-creeps.
Jazz, report security status.
No sign of decepticons here,
Prime.
What about Moonbase Two?
Jazz to Moonbase Two.
Jazz to Moonbase Two.
Bumblebee and Spike here.
We're about to send up a shuttle.
Any decepticon shenanigans in your area?
All clear, Jazz.
Hey, Ironhide, tell my son,
Daniel, I miss him.
And tell him not to worry.
I'll be coming home as soon as we've kicked Megatron's tail across the galaxy.
Will do, Spike.
Cliffjumper, commence countdown.
Five, four, three, two, one.
Blastoff!
Now, all we need is a little energon and a lot of luck.
Laserbeak returns, Megatron.
Welcome, Laserbeak.
Unlike some of my other warriors you never fail me.
Soundwave, play back
Laserbeak's findings.
As you command, Megatron.
I want you to make a special run to Autobot City on Earth.
- But, Prime--
- listen, Ironhide, we don't have enough energon cubes to power a full-scale assault.
Ready the shuttle for launch!
Now, all we need is a little energon and a lot of luck.
More than you imagine,
Optimus Prime.
Megatron!
Decepticons!
Die, autobots!
This was almost too easy,
Starscream.
Much easier, almighty Megatron, than attacking the real threat-- the autobots' moonbase.
You're an idiot, Starscream when we slip by their early warning systems in their own shuttle and destroy Autobot City the autobots will be vanquished forever!
No!
Such heroic nonsense.
Fish are jumping today, huh, Danno?
- I guess so.
- Hey, what's the matter?
Oh, I don't know, Hotrod.
Come on, you can tell me.
I guess I just miss my dad.
Don't worry,
Spike'll be back soon.
Oh, hey! I got something!
Wow! Look at the size of it!
Yep, it's a whopper all right!
Hotrod, the shuttle's coming!
Let's watch it land!
Talk about dull, Daniel.
Hurry or we'll miss it!
If you're gonna ride, Danno, ride in style!
Let's stop here!
Why settle for a peek, Daniel, when you can see everything from lookout mountain?
A little to the left.
A little bit more.
Turbo-revvin' young punk--
I'll straighten you out yet!
Hotrod, look!
There's a hole in the shuttle!
What?!
Decepticons!
What's that darn fool doing?
Attack!
Daniel!
Come on down, autobrat!
Huh, not bad for an old-timer.
"Old-timer"?
That's something you'll never be if you don't get back to the city.
Save it, Kup!
Let's burn rubber!
Ultra Magnus, a cursory evaluation of decepticon capability indicates a distinct tactical deficiency.
In other words, Perceptor?
We're outnumbered!
Springer, you and Arcee transform Autobot City.
Perceptor, tell Blaster to radio
Prime for reinforcements.
What about me, Magnus?
What about me? Huh? Huh? Huh?
I can help. I wanna help.
What about me?
Blurr, you can help me alert the others.
Absolutely positively definitely.
Nobody can get the job done faster than I can. Nobody!
Come on, Arcee, let's go!
But Hotrod and Kup are still outside the city!
We can't wait.
They'll have to take care of themselves. Come on!
Pathetic fools!
There's no escape!
Oh!
Ah! My foot!
Breach their defenses!
Mm, delicious. Eh, scrapmate?
Er, a little heavy on the electrons, electron.
The insecticons are in our way!
Wrong!
They're our way in!
Yah!
Look out and shout! Ow!
Hey, Perceptor, what's shaking
--other than this fortress?
Blaster, Ultra Magnus sends orders to contact Optimus Prime on Moonbase One.
All right, cover your receptors, Perceptor!
Optimus Prime, do you read me?
The decepticons are blitzing Autobot City.
We're really taking a pounding!
Don't know how much longer we can hold out.
Soundwave, jam that transmission!
Rumble, Frenzy, Ravage, Ratbat-- eject. Operation: Interference!
Optimus Prime, do you read me?
The decepticons are blitzing
Autobot City.
We're really taking... first we crack the shell, then we crack the nuts inside!
Hey! Run, Blaster!
Save yourself!
No way! Two can play!
Sic 'em!
Do you think you got through to Prime?
Let's hope so. Cos if I didn't we're all gonna look like burnt-out toaster ovens.
We've got decepticons at the gates! Decepticons in the air!
Decepticons inside the walls! Decepticons! Decepticons!
If we beat them at the walls they're still in the air, so where does that leave us?
Nowhere, that's where!
Come on, Arcee, we gotta get this launcher into place.
Megatron's making his big push and we gotta push back!
Keep at it, Springer, my boy, help's to hand!
Together now.
I was afraid you'd be trapped outside the city.
Unh! Hey, I wasn't worried for a microsecond.
Then you probably didn't understand the situation.
That did it.
Constructicons, merge for the kill!
Kup, Hotrod, look!
Devastator.
Prepare for extermination!
I got better things to do tonight than die.
Their defenses are broken, let the slaughter begin!
Dinobots, destroy Devastator!
Me, Grimlock, love challenge!
Dinobots transform!
Megatron must be stopped... no matter the cost.
Prime!
One shall stand, one shall fall.
Why throw away your life so recklessly?
That's a question you should ask yourself, Megatron.
No, I'll crush you with my bare hands!
I've got to help Prime!
Stay away, lad, that's Prime's fight!
I'll rip out your optics!
Finish him off, Prime!
Do it now!
No more, Optimus Prime!
Grant me mercy, I beg of you!
You, who are without mercy, now plead for it?
I thought you were made of sterner stuff.
No, you don't, Megatron!
Out of the way, Hotrod!
Fall! Fall!
I would've waited an eternity for this it's over, Prime.
Never!
Optimus... forgive me.
How do you feel, mighty Megatron?
Yah!
Astrotrain, transform and get us out of here.
Don't leave me, Soundwave.
As you command, Megatron.
The decepticons are retreating.
Prime did it, he turned the tide.
Astrotrain, take off!
I fear the wounds are fatal.
Prime, you can't die!
Do not grieve.
Soon I shall be one with the matrix.
Prime...
Ultra Magnus, it... it is to you, old friend...
I shall pass the matrix of leadership as it was passed to me.
But, Prime,
I am... just a soldier, I...
I'm not worthy. nor was I, but one day an autobot shall rise from our ranks and use the power of the matrix to light... our darkest hour.
Until that day... till all are one...
Jettison some weight or I'll never make it to Cybertron!
Fellow decepticons!
Astrotrain has requested that we lighten our burden.
In that case I say it is survival of the fittest.
Do I hear a second on that?
Aye!
And against?
Nay!
The ayes have it!
- Get! Make room for others!
- Don't!
Oh, how it pains me to do this.
Wait...
I still function.
Wanna bet?
Starscream!
Well, as Megatron has, how shall we say, departed,
I nominate myself as the new leader.
Wait, the constructicons formed Devastator, the most powerful robot.
We should rule!
Soundwave superior.
Constructicons inferior.
Who are you calling inferior?!
Nobody would follow an uncharismatic bore like you!
Hey, nobody calls
Soundwave uncrassimatic!
Yeah, let's kick tailgate!
Constructicons unite!
No way!
Welcome, Megatron.
Who... who said that?
I... am Unicron.
Show yourself.
I have summoned you here for a purpose.
Nobody summons Megatron.
Then it pleases me to be the first.
State your business.
This is my command.
You are to destroy the autobot matrix of leadership.
It is the one thing, the only thing, that can stand in my way.
You have nothing to fear.
I have already crushed Optimus
Prime with my bare hands.
You exaggerate.
The point is, he's dead.
And the matrix died with him.
No, the point is you are a fool.
The matrix has been passed to their new leader,
Ultra Magnus.
- Destroy it for me.
- Why should I?
What's in it for me?
Your bargaining posture is highly dubious.
Very well, I will provide you with a new body and new troops to command.
- And?
- And nothing!
You belong to me now.
I belong to nobody!
Perhaps I misjudged you.
Proceed... on your way to oblivion.
Ah! No! No!
I accept your terms! I accept!
Ah!
Excellent.
Behold... Galvatron!
And these shall be your minions.
Scourge, the tracker.
And his huntsmen-- the sweeps.
Cyclonus the warrior and his armada.
And this shall be your ship.
Now go.
Destroy the autobot matrix.
I will rip open Ultra Magnus and every other autobot until the matrix has been destroyed.
To Cybertron!
Destroy the matrix.
Get on with the ceremony!
My fellow decepticons as your new leader, I... who disrupts my coronation?!
"Coronation", Starscream?
This is bad comedy.
Megatron? Is that you?
Here's a hint!
Will anyone else attempt to fill his shoes?
What did he say his name was?
Galvatron!
Long live Galvatron!
Galvatron!
Where'd that come from?
Who cares? I'm more worried about where it's going!
Talk to me, Earth, we got a situation out here!
Roger me, wilco me, anything!
Hello, hello, Earth!
I'm picking up a faint signal.
This is Jazz. A ginormous, weird-looking planet just showed up in the suburbs of Cybertron.
And it's attacking Moonbase One!
Jazz! Cliffjumper!
Got to blast free, if we can!
Ignition and... hit it!
Jazz, we're not getting away!
This is Spike and Bumblebee up here on Moonbase Two.
This thing... this monster planet just ripped the first moon to shreds and it's heading this way!
We'll try and slow it down.
But you'd better get here fast because we're not gonna... dad!
Bumblebee, activate the explosives!
If this doesn't stop it, nothing will.
The explosives are activated, let's get out of here!
Hurry!
It's gonna blow!
- Hooray! We've done it!
- We did it!
Way to go!
- Look!
- It isn't even dented.
Oh, shit, what are we gonna do now?
We're being sucked into it!
How dare Unicron? Cybertron and all its moons belong to me!
Remember, we belong to him.
I belong to nobody!
I will obey... Unicron.
Decepticons, to Earth!
Autobots, prepare to board the shuttles.
This new menace is more dangerous than all the decepticons put together.
Somehow we must destroy it before it devours Cybertron.
But what about my dad?
He's on the moon between that monster planet and Cybertron.
Daniel, we'll do everything we can for Spike.
And what are we gonna do when we get there?
If that thing crunches moons it'll make short work of us.
Maybe the matrix can stop it.
You're right, it can!
What do you know about it, lad?
I just got this feeling.
Look!
To the shuttles!
I, Galvatron, will crush you just as Megatron crushed Prime!
And you'll die trying, just like Megatron.
Uh! Autobot scrap!
Do you want me to gut Ultra Magnus?
There are plenty of autobots for you. Ultra Magnus is mine!
Stay close to me, Daniel!
And you better stay close to me!
No, you'd better stay close to me.
Nice dino, good dino, sweet dino, won't you step into the nice spaceship for Blurr?
Pretty, pretty please? Nice dino, good dino, sweet dino!
Me Grimlock, not nice dino!
Me bash brains!
Blurr, get the dinobots in the shuttle!
I'm trying to get them into the shuttle cos I know we can't launch the shuttle until I get them into the shuttle but they're impossible, impossible, impossible!
OK, forget it.
Kup, Hotrod, you guys get the dinobots aboard and get out of here.
Come on, you big bozo, get in the shuttle!
This reminds me of the battle on alpha 9.
The petrorabbits were...
Grimlock, get your noodle out of my face!
Me Grimlock love Kup's war stories!
You're living one now.
Engage the boosters, for Cybertron's sake!
Tell Grimlock about petro-rabbits again.
I'll give you petro-rabbits!
Contact!
Looks like we're shipmates, squirt!
All right!
But if you get spacesick you're gonna walk home!
Hurry!
Wait, Ultra Magnus!
Arcee's still out there!
Jump!
Thanks.
That was close.
Believe it or not, this is the fun part.
Congratulations, autobots, we've lost them, so rest while you can.
Yep, I remember, the dust was so thick on beta 4 you had to use windshield wipers on your optic sensors.
Me Grimlock know all about wipers!
Want to hear good part of story!
Good part, Kup, tell Swoop good part.
OK, OK.
Well, the dust was really thick, and then this gigantic icthyac came tromping and stomping down the mountain, flames spewing out of its nostrils, and I thought for sure... hey, Kup, don't you think we have better things to do now than tell old stories?
Like what?
Like maybe figure out how we're gonna rescue our friends and then save Cybertron.
No! Tell story!
- Shh!
- Quiet!
We want to hear story!
- Grr!
- Time-out! Time-out! Time-out!
They're closing on us.
Yep, like the shrikebats of Dromedon.
- How'd you beat them?
- I'm trying to remember.
There were an awful lot of casualties that day.
Oh, yeah... we inverted polarities!
They're coming back!
All right, we survived that!
Yeah, but will we survive this?
Cyclonus, transform and attack.
I can't control it!
We're gonna crash!
Kup and Hotrod just bought it.
I can't deal with that now.
Face it, Magnus, the decepticons are gonna dog us until they see us dead!
Then that's exactly what they're gonna see.
Prepare for emergency separation.
- That's too dangerous!
- What choice do we have?
The autobots have been terminated.
Excellent.
And the matrix with them.
Unicron!
Why?! Take me to Unicron.
Take me now!
Ah!
Did we have to let them detonate three-quarters of the ship?
Seeing as how they would have detonated four-quarters,
I think it was a good choice.
But how are we gonna get there in this wreck?
Perceptor, can you locate a place to set down for repairs?
Gamma waves in this sector of space create marginal navigation probabilities. However... ahem... yes, I believe I can.
The planet of junk is in this vicinity.
Then let's go for it.
Kup! Grimlock!
Slag! Anybody!
Hotrod! Help me!
Kup?!
Kup!
Help!
Kup?
Talk to me!
- Fix me...
- sure, Kup, right away.
Brace for impact!
Say something... anybody!
Remind me to give the autopilot a raise.
Daniel?
I... I'm OK.
Let's try to salvage this thing.
Can I help too?
It's rough out there, kid.
I think Daniel can make himself useful with this.
It was Spike's exo-suit.
Dad's exo-suit!
He told me all about it.
Here, try it on.
Now, try to walk.
Come on, you can do it.
Just think about what you want to do before you do it.
It... it's kind of tricky.
Whoa! Oh!
Keep on practicing, you'll get the hang of it.
Come on, showtime's over.
We've got work to do.
This must be the junk capital of the universe.
Stop, thief!
No welcome-wagon hello stranger with that good coffee flavor for you.
Offer expires while you wait.
Operators are standing by.
That does it.
Well, what do you think?
Of all the circuit-glitched, diode-blowing dim-wittery you left a piece out!
No way!
You're just a little stiff.
Anyway, all things considered, you did an amazing job, lad.
Amazing!
- Really?
- Yeah.
You even got rid of that nasty burr in my rotator.
Now, let's find the dinobots and get off this twisted planet.
Don't act hostile.
I'll use the universal greeting.
"Universal greeting"?
Watch, I'll have 'em eating out of my hand.
Baa weep grahna weep ninny bong!
"Baa weep grahna weep ninny bong"?
Baa weep grahna weep ninny bong.
See? The universal greeting works every time.
Now, without making any sudden moves, offer them an energon goodie.
This is getting expensive!
Don't worry, they'll reciprocate.
I thought they were supposed to reciprocate?
No more!
Empty!
Reminds me of the Nitith slave mines on Galganas 7.
Every place reminds you of someplace else.
Experience, lad, you should learn to appreciate it.
Lot of good it's done us so far.
Hey, what's going on over there?
Has the imperial magistrate reached a verdict?
I have.
Guilty or innocent?
Innocent.
Feed him to the sharkticons.
We've got to get a new travel agent.
What is this place?
The world of the savage sharkticons and their cruel masters, the Quintessons.
I am Kranix.
My planet was destroyed by Unicron.
Unicron? Who's Unicron?
A planet that devours everything in its path.
So that's the monster's name.
No, please!
Ah! I'm the last survivor of Lithone!
No!
Let him go!
Ah!
Soon you too shall receive your sentence.
Has the imperial magistrate reached a verdict?
I have.
Guilty or innocent?
Spare me this mockery of justice!
I repeat, guilty or innocent?
Innocent.
Ah!
Ah!
Not the end I'd wish for, lad.
Me Swoop no see nothing.
Me Grimlock positive
Hotrod and Kup close me Slag say you full of beryllium baloney me Grimlock say you full of cesium salami!
Beryllium baloney!
Who say that?
You go wrong way.
You fool, I say.
Me Grimlock, fool?
Picture you got, no fool you not!
Me Grimlock no like you.
Ow!
Why boy hit my nose?
Wheelie save my friends today.
Me Grimlock say we on our way.
Unicron, why did you torture me?!
- You have failed.
- No, Unicron!
Ultra Magnus is dead and the matrix destroyed.
The matrix... has not been destroyed.
And Ultra Magnus lives on the planet of junk.
Stalk him. Tear him apart.
And destroy the matrix.
Be sure the fittings are securely welded.
Absolutely, positively definitely,
I wouldn't do it any other way!
Wow! This exo-suit's fantastic!
I think I'm starting to get the hang of it.
Decepticons!
We've got to draw them off and double back to the shuttle.
There goes the shuttle!
What do I do?!
Transform! Transform! You can do it, I know you can do it!
Transform!
Human germ!
Transform!
Yeah!
There they are. Attack!
Make a break for cover.
I'll try to unleash the power of the matrix.
Till all are one!
Till all are one!
Open, damn it, open!
Prime, you said the matrix would light our darkest hour.
Magnus! I want the matrix!
Never!
Sweeps, terminate him!
Ah!
Die!
Die!
Unicron, my master, with this I shall make you my slave.
Before his imperial magistrate delivers a verdict would you like to beg for your lives?
It sometimes helps, but not often.
I can't transform.
Keep trying.
Silence or you will be held in contempt of this court!
I have nothing but contempt for this court.
Guilty or innocent?
Innocent.
They've got more sharkticons than we have photon charges.
Then let's hold a demolition derby.
Didn't even bend a fender!
Yeah, but look, there are a lot more of those can-diggin', grill-crackin' things!
We can't hold out forever, Kup, but we can give them one humungous repair bill!
Execute them!
Excuse me!
Me Grimlock want to munch metal.
I never thought I'd be so happy to see those big bozos!
Me Grimlock no bozo!
Me king!
Sharkticons, execute them!
Me Grimlock say execute them!
I think the problems on this planet will be solved very shortly.
Yeah, but what about our problems? We need a ship.
You get ship if I get trip!
Who are you?
Him Wheelie.
Him friend!
He'll be mine too if he can find a ship.
Give stare over there.
That's a ship?
Who cares, as long as it flies.
Ultra Magnus!
Without the matrix there is no hope, no, hope, no hope at all.
First Prime, now Ultra Magnus.
What'll we do?
- Look!
Don't look behind door number 2, Monty!
It's time to play end of the line, my valentine.
Geroni-do-ron-ron-ronimo!
It's not hard to knock 'em down, it's getting 'em to stay down that's the trick.
They're indestructible!
And they're everywhere!
You check in but you don't check out.
Steady as she goes, bob.
Snooping visitors getting mud in the eye, by and by. Film at 11.
It's Hotrod!
And Kup and the dinobots!
Guns aren't exactly friendly.
Neither are they, in case you haven't noticed.
What was that universal greeting again? Never mind, I remember.
Baa weep grahna weep ninny bong!
Baa weep grahna weep ninny bong?
Baa weep grahna weep ninny bong.
Baa weep grahna weep ninny bong!
Baa weep grahna weep ninny bong!
Ugh! Me Grimlock not kisser!
Me Grimlock king!
Have a nice day! Please close cover before striking, friends!
...so say the Junkions!
Where'd you learn to talk like that?
TV. We talk TV.
You talk some TV?
I talk some TV... and now the news, don't touch that dial.
By George, Kemo Sabes, your smashed-up friend soon like brand-new with 90-day warranty.
Happy motoring!
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Look, he's alive!
He's alive, I don't believe it!
You're... all alive.
The matrix... has gone and with it all hope.
- No!
- Galvatron has it!
Where's Galvatron? Where is he?
And the answer is...
Unicron!
Then we've got to destroy Unicron.
Yes, friends, and now destroy Unicron.
Kill the grand poobah!
Eliminate even the toughest stain.
Help us, home us.
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
Sale must end.
Rush right on down and test-drive latest model with no obligation.
New, improved Junkion planet is sleek, sexy import with turbo handling!
Yeah, destroy Unicron!
Kill the grand poobah!
Eliminate even the toughest stains!
Destroy Unicron...!
Unicron!
Unicron, answer me!
See this? The matrix!
I now possess that which you most fear.
You will do my bidding or taste my wrath.
You underestimate me, Galvatron.
For a time...
I considered sparing your wretched little planet, Cybertron.
But now... you shall witness... its dismemberment!
No!
Decepticons, we're under attack!
Scramble!
I don't believe it.
Doesn't this remind you of anything, Kup?
No.
I've never seen anything like this before.
What happened to Moonbase Two?
Where's my dad?!
That's what we're gonna find out.
Framed in enamel!
Resists fire, rain and corrosion for up to 5 years.
Satisfaction guaranteed.
Or your money back!
- Where's Hotrod?
- I don't know.
But I hope they didn't get him!
Quick, this way!
The matrix!
It will do you no good, autobot.
It cannot be opened.
Not by a decepticon.
Like it or not, we are allies now against a common foe.
Ah!
Destroy him, Galvatron.
Now!
Or you yourself shall be obliterated.
Of course, my master!
Puny autobot, you lack even Prime's courage!
Me Grimlock kick butt!
Me Grimlock need new strategy.
Help!
Help!
Daniel!
Arcee! Kup!
Dad!
Daniel!
Dad, what can I do?!
Knock down the acid cover!
How?!
Blast it, son!
But I don't have a gun!
Use your exo-suit!
Hurry!
Dad!
Daniel! You did it!
Yeah! I did it!
Come out, autobot!
We all must die sometime.
Not today, Galvatron!
I will crush you with my bare hands.
Die autobot!
First Prime, then Ultra Magnus and now... you.
It's a pity you autobots die so easily or I might have a sense of satisfaction now.
Arise, Rodimus Prime.
Optimus... no!
This is the end of the road,
Galvatron.
Ah!
Now light our darkest hour.
Spike! Daniel!
Springer, what's going on?!
No time to answer that now - let's get out of here!
Look!
Autobots, transform and roll out!
I knew you had potential, lad.
Destiny!
You cannot... destroy... my... destiny!
Let this mark the end of the Cybertronian Wars as we march forward to a new age of peace and happiness!
Till all are one!
Till all are one!
Till all are one!
Till all are one!
CHILDREN: Bless all the people, young and old.
For they are yours to love and hold.
And bless
Mr. and Mrs. Cherrywood.
Amen.
Good night, children.
Sweet dreams.
Mrs. Cherrywood, isn't Mr. Cherrywood going to tuck us in?
Oh, he'll be along.
Don't you worry.
I hope I'm not too late.
They've been asking for you.
Mr. Cherrywood!
MR. CHERRYWOOD:
Look sharp, everyone.
Watch the bouncing balls.
All righty, here we go.
A one, a two, a three and there!
Thank you, and thank you.
Now off to sleep to dream of clowns and circuses, acrobats and jugglers.
And remember,
I want a full report in the morning.
Story, Mr. Cherrywood, story?
GIRL: Please, the one about the circus.
Please?
Yeah.
All right, just one story.
Story hat.
Yeah.
This is the story of two young children named Kim and Jason, and how they were helped by a group of very special friends, the Care Bears.
You see, the Care Bears have a very special mission.
And that mission is to help everyone share their feelings with others.
The Care Bears live in a magic place called Care-a-lot.
* Care-a-lot is a place
 we all can go
* Whenever we choose it
* Care-a-lot is a feeling
 we all know
* We never do lose it
* We can find a secret place
* To rest and make a new start
* If you don't know
 where it is
* Look inside your heart
* Care-a-lot is a playground
 you can find
* For sliding and swinging
* Carousels playing music
 in your mind
* For dancing and singing
* Sometimes you feel so glad
* Sometimes you feel blue
* Share your feelings,
 it's not bad
* Feelings are just you
* When you're lonely
* Don't you fret
* You're not alone
 you just tend to forget
* Care-a-lot is easily found
* You've been there
* And you have friends
 who care
* Don't you let your sadness
 get you down
* It always helps
 when you sing a song
* Good cheer carries you along
* Through darkness leads
 to sunlight
* A new day comes,
 it's all right
* Care-a-lot is a place
 you'd like to be
* Riding on a cloud,
 you'll care a lot
* It's a rainbow fantasy
* For laughing out loud
* Care-a-lot is a place
 we all can go
* Is a place we all can go
* Care-a-lot is a place
 we all can go
* Is a place we all can go
* Care-a-lot,
 it's a place we all can go
* Is a place we all can go
* Learn to care a lot
* Share a lot
* Care-a-lot
No, Secret Bear,
I don't think it was the Cloud-mobile's fault.
Hi. I'm Friend Bear and this is Secret Bear.
We're Care Bears.
What do you want?
Only to be your friends.
MR. CHERRYWOOD: You see,
 although Kim and Jason were
warm and loving children, they had been so hurt
 when their parents
went away that they had decided
 never to love anyone
ever again, just in case
 they, too, went away.
Kim and Jason felt
they didn't need anyone, but the Care Bears
 knew better.
Everyone needs friends, Jason, even you and Kim.
We're not your friends.
How do you know our names?
We know a lot of things about you.
Kim reads a lot of books and wants to be a nurse when she grows up.
And, Jason, you wanna be a jet pilot.
Yeah. How did you know that?
Friends are supposed to know about each other's hopes and dreams.
Secret Bear says not to worry.
No one can keep a secret like Secret Bear.
Well, I'll tell you what we know about people you care for.
They always let you down.
KIM: So we'd rather not have any friends.
Don't trouble yourselves.
MR. CHERRYWOOD:
 While the Care Bears tried
even harder to make friends
 with Kim and Jason,
Tenderheart was on his way
 to help a boy
who wanted friends more than anything else
 in the whole world.
Nicholas was
 a magician's helper.
He had never had
 a friend in his life.
Thanks.
Hey!
Close the door!
Whoa!
I--I didn't mean it.
You never mean it, Nicholas.
I bought that trunk thinking maybe there's some junk in it
I can use in my magic act.
Now half of it's broken!
What am I going to do with you?
Every time I give you a simple thing to do, it's boom this and crash that!
I'm sorry, Mr. Fetuccini.
Enough of your sorrys.
Check that new trunk and see if there's anything left
I can use in my magic act.
I have a show to put on.
Perhaps one day
I will teach you how to make an audience love you.
But right now you're next to hopeless.
I wish...
I'd give anything to find a way to get people to like me.
FEMALE VOICE: Anything?
Nicholas?
Who's there?
Who said that?
You did say
"anything"?
Whoa!
Gosh.
MR. CHERRYWOOD:
 Tenderheart was trapped.
He needed some
 Care Bear reinforcements.
But unfortunately they were
 busy with their new invention.
SHARE BEAR:
With this Rainbow Rescue Beam, we can send a Care Bear anywhere in the whole world in a matter of seconds.
Or bring them back again in case of an emergency.
We'll be able to help people share their feelings a lot quicker.
We've gotta get it working first, Share Bear.
And then we still won't know what'll happen until we give it another test.
How come I'm always the one fixing things around here?
Because you never complain,
Grumpy Bear.
I think I know why the first test didn't work.
There. This little star got itself stuck in the gears.
Now that's what I call
"star stuck," Grumpy Bear.
Has anyone seen Baby Hugs and Baby Tugs?
I can't find them anywhere.
We'll help you look,
Grams Bear.
We can test the Rainbow Rescue Beam later.
That Baby Tugs is probably just getting into mischief somewhere.
What's this thing, Tugs?
It's not a thing, Hugs.
It's, uh, a thing-a-ma-dooey.
You know everything, Tugs.
What's it do?
It makes bubbles.
Square bubbles!
Square bubbles?
Golly, make square bubbles,
Tugs.
Any special color?
No square bubbles, Tugs.
Not even round ones.
HUGS: You broke the thing.
GRUMPY BEAR:
Baby Hugs, Baby Tugs, what have you done?
BIRTHDAY BEAR: It's obvious,
Grumpy Bear, they got the Rainbow Rescue
Beam working.
But we still don't know if it'll transport anyone.
Look!
Oh, my stars, it brought visitors.
What are they doing here?
We didn't bring them.
They just came along.
Someone brought us here.
I knew it!
Baby Bear mischief.
What are we gonna do with those children?
SHARE BEAR: I don't know.
This has never happened before.
Perhaps we can let them stay.
Hey, could we say something?
Where are we?
We're terribly sorry.
Bears?
We're the Care Bears.
BOTH: More friends?
Welcome to Care-a-lot!
Come on.
We'll give you a tour.
Okay, but we're not gonna like it.
(NOBODY CARES LIKE A BEAR
 PLAYING)
* I know you're thinking
 that nobody cares
* You've got some feelings
 you don't wanna share
* But if your troubles stay
 all stuck inside
* They're gonna grow
 till they're too big to hide
* I know you're trying
 to steer so clear of friends
* You've had a few
 that left you in the end
* I gotta tell you
 it ain't always so
* Somebody loves you
 who ain't gonna go
* So follow me
 and let me take you where
* If you think nobody cares
* Nobody cares
* Nobody cares like a bear
* You'll need a friend to get a big job done
* I guess sometimes two heads are better than one
* You'll need a friend to let your feelings free
* Sure could use someone to talk to me
* So make a friend
 and let me take you where
* When you think nobody cares
* Nobody cares
* Nobody cares like a bear
* So don't go sticking
 by your own sweet self
* You gotta take a chance
 on someone else
* That's what it's all about,
 just being friends
* And take a chance
 on loving again
* And follow me
 and let me take you where
* When you think nobody cares
* Nobody cares
* Nobody cares like a bear
* When you think nobody cares
* Nobody cares
* Nobody cares like a bear
MR. CHERRYWOOD: (CHUCKLING)
 Well, thanks to
 the Care Bears,
Kim and Jason remembered
 how good it was
 to have friends who cared.
Their troubles were over.
But for Nicholas,
 his real troubles were
 just beginning.
FEMALE VOICE: Nicholas?
Who are you?
How do you know my name?
I am a spirit, Nicholas.
Your friend.
I know many things.
Almost everything.
Everything?
I know how you can earn
 more friends.
Really? How?
With magic.
Magic?
Oh, not his magic tricks.
I mean real magic.
Magic that can make
 your fondest wish come true.
Y-You mean, you could use magic to get people to like me?
No.
But you could.
All you have to do is undo the lock.
No, don't!
Hey, what are you doing in there?
I've gotta stop this!
Nicholas! Nicky?
Hey, are you okay in there?
Read this.
Did I do that?
You can do a lot more.
Hey, Nicky, open up!
The door's stuck!
Read!
FETUCCINI:
Hey, Nicholas!
SPIRIT: Go ahead.
Open it.
Hey, it worked.
Your spell worked.
Well done, Nicholas.
He'll be in a deep sleep only long enough for you to take over his magic show.
But I couldn't.
Yes, you can. You must.
This is your chance to show that you are a greater magician than he.
They love him for his magic.
They'll love you for yours.
I'll help you.
TENDERHEART:
Nicholas, stop!
This isn't the way to make friends.
Who are you?
I'm Tenderheart, a Care Bear.
Your friend.
Friend?
Where was he when you needed him?
What matters is,
I'm here now, when Nicholas needs me the most.
SPIRIT: See, Nicholas?
Magic can do anything you want it to.
Hey, neat!
TENDERHEART: Magic isn't the answer, Nicholas.
Your feelings can help you find the true answer.
Don't listen to him!
There are dozens of children out there waiting to see your magic.
They'll love me just like they love
The Great Fetuccini.
I know all his tricks.
I'm not doing anything wrong.
He won't succeed.
The spirit doesn't care about him.
But I do!
NICHOLAS:
And now The Amazing Nicholas will pull a dove out of his hat.
Stop it!
I knew this was going to happen.
Make them stop laughing.
Make them stop!
Only you can do that. Here!
Teach them a lesson.
A--A lesson?
BOY: Come on!
Make us laugh.
SPIRIT: One they'll never forget.
Nicholas! No!
Now they know how you felt all your life without a friend in the world.
Now they feel nothing!
Nicholas, what have you done?
Only what they did to me.
They deserved it.
No, Nicholas, please listen!
Quick, Nicholas!
SPIRIT: This is only
 the beginning!
This is a job for all the Care Bears.
WISH BEAR: Jason! Kim!
Wait'll you hear this.
Look, Secret Bear,
Wish Bear's got her head stuck in the clouds again.
Now where's my Star-oscope?
Looking for this?
Oh, sorry, Grumpy Bear, but I'm in a hurry.
I've got great news for Kim and Jason.
I spotted...
Look!
FRIEND BEAR:
Tenderheart's Rainbow Roller is out of control!
Oh, no!
Quick, run for cover!
It's coming!
Brace yourselves!
What's coming?
Everyone okay?
Share Bear?
I think so.
Too bad we can't say the same for Care-a-lot.
Look!
FRIEND BEAR: Oh, no!
Everything's broken!
Faded!
Ruined!
FUNSHINE BEAR: Tenderheart!
The Caring Meter dropped two whole points!
A lot of people must have suddenly just stopped caring.
What could have caused that?
The same thing that caused the cloud quake!
A boy named Nicholas is being taken over by an evil spirit.
An evil spirit?
What happens when the
Caring Meter drops to zero?
No one in the world will care anymore.
And the end of Care-a-lot?
I think that's exactly what the spirit has in mind!
Oh, my gosh, I forgot.
I sighted parents for you at the orphanage.
They want to adopt you both.
Congratulations,
Kim and Jason.
Come on, Grumpy, let's warm up the
Rainbow Rescue Beam.
Kim and Jason have to get back in a hurry.
Hear that, Jason? Parents!
Yeah.
I thought we'd never have parents.
Yeah.
But, Kim...
I know, Jason.
Our friends, they're in trouble.
Kim, Jason, we're ready.
All set?
No!
We're not going back to the orphanage.
We're going to help you.
Yeah.
But you have parents waiting.
We made up our minds.
You showed us how to share our feelings, and that's just what we're going to do.
Yeah? Really?
BOTH: Yeah.
All right, our first job is to go to Earth and find Nicholas.
Friend Bear, Secret Bear, you head down with Kim and Jason.
We'll follow.
Hold on to this for me, Jason.
Don't lose it.
It's very important.
Don't worry, Tenderheart,
I wouldn't lose it for nothing.
All right, Champ Bear and Funshine, you're next!
GRUMPY BEAR: Oh, no!
The Rainbow Rescue Beam's jammed!
They never made it to Earth.
What do you mean?
Where are they?
They're lost somewhere between here and Earth.
What do we do now?
We can't follow them.
And the evil spirit said this was just the beginning.
MR. CHERRYWOOD:
 As Nicholas continued to cast
the spirit's evil spells, more and more people
 stopped caring.
Everyone in this town has friends.
But soon they'll all be just like me.
Friendless!
MR. CHERRYWOOD:
As this wave of uncaring grew, so did the storms
 around Care-a-lot.
The Care Bears were trapped,
cut off from the Earth, and any chance of rescuing
 Kim, Jason, Secret Bear,
 and Friend Bear.
The cloud quakes had broken
 the Rainbow Rescue Beam.
But the Care Bears would
 never give up.
That's what made them think
 of the river.
Good luck, Care Bears.
We're counting on you!
MR. CHERRYWOOD: No one
 in Care-a-lot had ever
 followed the river.
They had no idea whether
 it would lead them to Kim,
Jason, and the missing Care Bears,
 or to nowhere at all.
But the Rainbow Rescue Beam
had dropped Kim, Jason, and the two Care Bears right smack in the middle
 of a strange new land.
Wow.
This doesn't look like the Earth I remember.
Maybe we're still in Care-a-lot.
FRIEND BEAR:
If this is Care-a-lot, then someone's been doing a little gardening since we left.
Whoa!
I can't hold on much longer.
Secret Bear says not to worry about falling.
Worry about the lion instead.
ALL: Lion?
What are we going to do?
FRIEND BEAR: Close your eyes.
Maybe he won't see us.
See? He's gone.
JASON: Kim!
Give me your hand, slowly.
JASON: Oh, no!
Hey, they don't have any tails.
Wow.
The monkey can talk.
What happened to all your fur?
We--We never had any fur.
That's impossible!
Every monkey has fur.
And who said they were monkeys? Hmm?
Well, they were up in the tree.
I know.
They're lions with haircuts.
We're not lions or monkeys.
Yeah. We're people.
And we're Care Bears.
Where did you come from?
BRAVE HEART LION:
Why, we live here.
Everyone in the Forest of Feelings knows of Playful Heart Monkey and Brave Heart Lion.
Forest of Feelings?
Well, we're from Earth.
And Care-a-lot.
Earth? Care-a-lot?
There's no such place.
There is, too!
Don't mind Playful Heart.
He loves to laugh at anything.
I've heard tales long ago about other places.
What are these other places like?
(HOME IS IN YOUR HEART
 PLAYING)
* Do you have a place where rainbows grow
* To carry a bear who's sliding?
* Well, I have a rock in a cave below
* Just perfect for hiding
* Do you have a house made all out of wood
* For keeping you dry when it's raining?
FRIEND BEAR: * I stay on top when the rain goes drop
* Look, I'm hydroplaning
Wee!
* Forest of Feelings,
Care-a-lot
* And earth aren't far apart
* They differ in some ways, some ways not
* 'Cause home is in your heart
* Do you have a star that can travel far
* And tell you what my star told me?
* No, but I have a tree that plays with me
* With branches that swing and enfold me
* Do you have a flower?
We call it a rose
* Its petals are softer than pillows
Look, I see a bee on Friend Bear's nose!
KIM: Stop!
Stay perfectly still.
Oh!
* Forest of Feelings,
Care-a-lot
* And earth are the homes we claim
* Loving each other
* What we've got are places with a different name
* But they're all the same
* Forest of Feelings,
Care-a-lot
* And earth are the homes we claim
* Right here with you, my friend
* Forest of Feelings,
Care-a-lot
* And earth are all the same
* We are all the same
* Do you have a bed where you sleep at night
* With billowy blankets all over?
PLAYFUL HEART MONKEY:
 I sleep in a thicket,
on soft green grass, covered with cushiony clover.
My bed is cozy and light as a cloud.
Your bed is a cloud!
Oh, yeah.
* Colors and flowers and hearts in a crown
* Are just about everywhere
* Forest of Feelings,
Care-a-lot
* And earth aren't far apart
* They differ in some ways, some ways not
* 'Cause home is in your heart
* Home is in your heart
* Forest of Feelings,
Care-a-lot
* And earth are the homes we claim
* We love each other, loving each other
* What we've got are places with a different name
* Home is all the same
* Forest of Feelings,
Care-a-lot
* And earth aren't far apart
* They differ in some ways, some ways not
* 'Cause home is in your heart
* Home is in your heart
* Home is in your heart
You're welcome to stay in the Forest of Feelings as long as you like.
Thank you, Brave Heart, but the sooner we leave the better.
If we don't hurry,
Care-a-lot may not be there when we get back.
We have to find a way back to Earth.
To help stop the evil spirit from taking all the feelings from everybody.
Come on, everybody.
Where?
If there is a way out of the Forest of Feelings, we'll help you find it.
This way.
There!
The spell is cast.
Now everyone in town will know the loneliness they've made me feel.
Not quite.
Look!
These two small children still care very much about everyone, except you.
But they were to fall under my spell.
Ah, but those--those soft little bears shield them from your spells with their love and caring.
Let them go!
I'm even now!
Are you?
What about all the others?
Others?
All the others that you have not yet cast your spells on.
All the others that still care.
I've gotten even with the whole town.
That's all I wanted.
The others will come after you for what you've done.
What should I do?
You must finish it.
Go ahead, say it!
SPIRIT: This spell will seek out the children and bring them to us at any cost.
But isn't there another way?
No! They must be taught a lesson!
A lesson for the children.
A lesson for the town!
A lesson for everyone.
What do you mean, "everyone"?
Now go!
You said, "a lesson."
What kind of lesson?
Never mind that.
You must now collect the ingredients for your next spell.
WISH BEAR: There's nothing ahead to tell us where we are,
Tenderheart.
Bear overboard!
Bedtime Bear went to sleep and fell overboard.
Look!
Hi. I think you've lost something.
LOVE-A-LOT BEAR:
Oh, thank you very much.
I'm sure Bedtime Bear will thank you, too, when he wakes up.
COZY HEART PENGUIN:
No thanks needed.
I'm Cozy Heart Penguin.
Helping someone in need is what warms my heart and keeps me cozy.
Well, it must work,
Cozy Heart.
This water's freezing!
I love it!
First we have to find
Kim and Jason, and then...
Uh-oh.
Something's pulling at the wheel.
Tenderheart, why are you turning here?
I'm not!
The boat's turning by itself!
LOVE-A-LOT BEAR: We're caught in some kind of whirlpool!
ALL: Whoa!
ALL: Whoa!
WISH BEAR:
Somebody do something!
A rope!
Throw me a rope!
Do as she says!
Quick!
Guide this rope,
Little Star.
Oh, Champ Bear, we're saved!
May I introduce the strongest, most fearsome creature in the entire
Forest of Feelings.
Lotsa Heart Elephant.
Hello.
Hey, you're a lot smaller than you sound.
It's true that I'm not big, but it's amazing what you can do if you really put your heart into it.
(LAUGHING) Sometimes I even startle myself.
It's not going to work.
Even the Spell can't defeat them.
The Spell was just having a little sport.
The children are his true goal.
Perhaps a sprinkle of toadstool mold would speed things up.
Grumpy Bear!
Ouch! Ow, ow, ow.
The Caring Meter is down to five.
If it reaches zero,
Care-a-lot is finished!
And no one will care anymore.
Any luck fixing the Rainbow Rescue Beam?
I think I used up all my good luck getting this far.
Maybe your luck's run out, but not mine!
I need a piece that looks like this.
Whoa!
Try that.
It's Baby Hugs' lollipop.
Perfect!
You know, Baby Hugs and Tugs are gonna make fine Care Bears one of these days.
You rest there while I scout up ahead.
ALL: Whew.
While Brave Heart's gone, let's play a guessing game.
What am I?
I don't know.
Look out!
Help!
Let us go!
Help!
Oh, no!
Let us go!
Charge!
Help!
All right, you asked for it!
Whoa.
Let them go!
Swift Heart!
Oh.
Phew.
Whoa!
Let's get out of here!
Come on, Swift Heart.
SWIFT HEART RABBIT:
I'm way ahead of you.
Oh, no!
That's the most unfriendly tree I've ever seen.
Well, thanks to you,
Swift Heart, we're safe for now.
FRIEND BEAR: There's a serious task at hand, Swift Heart.
It seems that the evil spirit is after Kim and Jason.
An evil spirit in the Forest of Feelings?
We'll fill you in as we go.
Let's get moving.
TENDERHEART: Lotsa Heart, do you think this river might lead us down to Earth?
It has to go somewhere.
Hang on, everyone, we're going for a ride.
ALL: Whoa!
Look, a cave!
TENDERHEART:
I can't see a thing.
VOICE: Steer to the left!
TENDERHEART:
Who said that?
FUNSHINE BEAR: Not me.
LOVE-A-LOT BEAR:
Neither did I.
WISH BEAR: It wasn't me.
VOICE: It was me!
I said it!
TENDERHEART:
Who are you?
VOICE: Don't ask questions.
Steer left quick!
TENDERHEART: Hang on, everyone!
Phew, that was close.
You almost smashed right into a big rock.
Look!
I see light up ahead.
A raccoon?
No wonder you could see in the dark.
Not just a raccoon.
Bright Heart Raccoon.
I can usually see my way through anything.
WISH BEAR: Waterfalls ahead!
We better do something quick.
Care Bears!
Ready?
Now!
Whoa!
Well done, Care Bears.
LOTSA HEART: Let's hear it for the Care Bears!
ALL: Hip, hip, hurray!
Hip, hip, hurray!
Oh, no!
Run!
Brave Heart?
Whoa!
Oh, no!
Are you okay, Kim?
Jason, we've got to run.
Where? We're trapped.
And that bird knows it, too.
We can't reach them!
You're right, Secret Bear.
Our only hope is a Care Bear Stare.
I just hope it works.
There's only two of us.
Right again.
We've got to try.
Care Bears stare!
The two of us aren't enough!
Oh, no!
Look!
Care Bears stare!
That was magnificent.
Your friends arrived just in time.
Jason, Kim!
You're all right!
Thanks to our new friends.
I know exactly what you mean.
I think things will get a lot easier now that we're together, Brave Heart.
I couldn't agree with you more, Lotsa Heart.
Soon you'll be out of the Forest of Feelings.
Then your journey will really begin.
You're not coming with us?
Well, uh, yes, if you think we could help.
Glad to have you along.
We can use all the help we can get.
Well, in that case...
* We're calling for
 the loyal hearts
* Wherever they may be
* We're calling for
 the proud hearts
* To come and follow me
* We're calling for
 the gentle hearts
* To keep us company
* And it would be
 a treat heart
* If you would follow me
* 'Cause there's
 a job to be done
* We're gonna need everyone
* Because nobody
 can do it alone
* We'll need the swift
 and the small
* We'll need the strong
 and the tall
* 'Cause everyone has
 a strength of their own
* And when you put it
 all together
* Then there's a power
 no one can deny
* It's the power to share,
 it's the power to care
* 'Cause when you care
 you're not afraid to try
* Yeah!
* And when you put it
 all together
* Then there's a power
 no one can deny
* It's the power to share,
 it's the power to care
* When you care,
 you're not afraid to try *
SPIRIT: They're on their way.
Here?
You'll be ready for them.
How?
By completing your final spell.
Final spell?
Yes.
You must gather the elements quickly.
When those two children arrive, they must be all that is left of caring in this world.
You don't mean...
Yes!
Everyone must be taught the lesson.
But...
Don't you see, Nicholas?
It's too late to stop now.
You must finish what you started!
There's no turning back!
MR. CHERRYWOOD: It was
 hard to believe that only
a short time ago this was a place
 of happiness and joy.
Now, without love
to keep it alive, it had become a home of fear, loneliness and ruin.
Time was running out
 for the Care Bears.
Nicholas and the evil spirit
had to be stopped before they cast
 their final spell.
A world without caring?
This doesn't look like the Earth you talked about.
We've got to stop it before it gets worse.
I don't think this place could get any worse.
Nicholas and the spirit must be around here somewhere.
We've got to find them as quickly as possible.
I suggest we split up.
I agree, Tenderheart.
The first ones to spot them, warn the others.
Okay, let's go get them.
Jason, do you still have the key that I gave you?
Sure do.
Good. Now, promise me you and Kim will stay as far away from Nicholas and the spirit as you can.
But I wanna help.
You can help best by guarding that key.
B-But...
If we lose that key, Jason, we can never win.
I understand, Tenderheart.
You can count on me.
Three apple cores.
Just what I need.
One spider's web.
My list is almost complete.
A few more items, a few magic words, and presto, a world without love.
Love-a-lot, did you hear that?
We have to get word to the others before it's too late.
Hmm. Let's see. Apple cores, spider's web, milkweed pod...
Huh?
A cigar butt.
I almost missed it.
Now, one last thing to find.
BOTH: Phew.
BOY: There they go.
Phew. That was close.
Oh, no! Run away!
Hurry up! Look out!
Run away!
Get away! Oh, dear!
Watch out!
* Run for cover
* Don't stop to look around
* Nothing to do
* But hide someplace
 where we cannot be found
Don't make a sound.
Look out!
Be careful.
Here he comes!
Whoa!
Run away!
* Look out, he's after you
* You ought to take care,
 but take care where you go
* It's a nightmare coming true
* The evil that's spreading
 is starting to grow
* Your friends are doing
 all they can do
* But what about you?
* How can we help
 this unfortunate soul?
* How can we stop him?
 He's out of control
* Running and hiding
 to stay out of sight
* Running and hiding,
 it doesn't seem right
* Look out! Watch out!
 Hurry, get away!
* Running and hiding
 and running again
* Running and running,
 oh, please make it end
* Isn't there some way
 to make him our friend?
* The spirit's got
 a hold on Nicholas
* He's forgot about feelings
 and friends
* Look out, he's after you
* It's a nightmare coming true
* When will
 this bad dream end?
* He's not himself,
 he's turning mean
* He's been on a path
 of terrible wrath
* No kid's ever seen
SWIFT HEART RABBIT: Hey!
* Friends are there
 to help you out
* Because they care
 and there's no doubt
* That if you're scared,
 they'll lend a hand
* Till you're prepared
 to make a stand
* This power's wrong,
 but incredibly strong
* If only we could
 make him understand
* Look out, watch out!
 Look out! Look out!
* Look out! Watch out!
* What can you do
 if there's only two of you?
* What can you do
 if there's only two of you?
* What can you do
 if there's only two of you? *
Huh?
Icky, sticky bubble gum!
The last ingredient
I need for my final spell.
Let them try and stop me now!
Swift Heart, are you all right?
You bet, Friend Bear.
It takes more than that to slow me down.
Where are Kim and Jason?
Maybe they're hiding and are afraid to show themselves.
TENDERHEART:
Okay, Brave Heart.
You round up your friends and try to find Kim and Jason.
Care Bears, follow me.
What are you going to do,
Tenderheart?
We have to try and get through to Nicholas.
And make him believe that we really do care about him.
And that he really cares about everyone else.
With a Care Bear Stare?
That's right, Cozy Heart.
I wish there was some way we could express our feelings like that.
There's always a way to let others share your feelings,
Gentle Heart, always.
Let's go.
We don't have much time.
MR. CHERRYWOOD: It was going
to take every ounce of caring that the Care Bears
could muster to reach Nicholas.
But as you remember,
 they were two bears short.
Grumpy Bear and Good Luck Bear were still in Care-a-lot
 trying to fix the Rainbow
Rescue Beam, or what was left of it.
I just need a little more time.
That's the one thing we don't have.
The Caring Meter has fallen to three.
In no time, it'll fall to zero.
And that's the end of Care-a-lot.
We've got to get down there and help!
Good.
Now, the final ingredient.
SPIRIT: Quickly!
Why are you stopping?
I--I--I don't want...
You don't want to?
You must!
You can't care about anything!
No!
SPIRIT: You've gone too far!
Too far to stop!
You can't stop!
You are beyond this!
TENDERHEART: Stop!
Nicholas!
You're too late.
Too late!
The last spell is cast!
We care about everyone, even when they don't care about us.
And right now, the one we care about most is you, Nicholas!
You!
Care Bears, get ready.
Care Bears, stare!
You don't care!
Whoa!
SPIRIT: Now for the very last two children.
COZY HEART PENGUIN:
What happened in there?
SHARE BEAR: The Care Bear
Stare didn't work!
The spirit's power is too strong!
Brave Heart, where are Kim and Jason?
We can't find them anywhere.
Uh-oh. Look!
Nicholas?
Where are they?
As long as Kim and Jason still care, his spell's not complete.
You mean, you can still save him?
We can still save him.
But how?
Just feel it!
Care Bears?
Ha!
Well, what do you know?
The Rainbow Rescue Beam worked.
See? We just needed a little luck.
GRUMPY BEAR:
Looks like we're gonna need more than that.
Where are they?
Where are you hiding the boy and girl?
You don't know what you're doing, Nicholas.
Listen to your heart, and you'll find the truth.
Where are they?
Care Bears stare!
Too late.
Tenderheart's right.
We can do it, but we have to do it together.
Do what?
Okay, everybody.
Uh, uh, everybody, uh...
That's it!
Everybody call!
SPIRIT: No!
Nicholas!
Kim, Jason, no!
It's them!
It's the children.
Nicholas!
We care about you.
We used to be like you.
We thought nobody cared.
But we were wrong.
Now we want to be your friends, Nicholas, and make sure you're never alone again.
Believe us, Nicholas, believe us.
I--I--I believe you.
No, you can't!
SPIRIT: Don't do it.
Stop.
You don't care!
They don't care!
Stop!
Please, don't close me!
Jason, the key.
The key!
I--I--I can't hold it much longer!
No!
Oh, no!
Hold on, Nicholas.
Thank you.
MR. CHERRYWOOD: And so it was
 that the love and caring
of the Care Bears, their new friends,
 and the two children
 saved the day.
KIM: I guess Care-a-lot is safe and sound again.
And as long as
Care-a-lot is safe, so is the world below it.
Mr. Fetuccini!
I almost forgot.
He's still under that sleeping spell.
It's showtime!
Mr. Fetuccini!
I'm sorry.
Nicholas, I just had the most wonderful dream.
I dreamed I changed my poster, so that's what I'm going to do.
Now it'll read:
"Fetuccini and Nicholas."
So what do you say, huh?
A partnership.
A part-- A part...
Oh, all right.
"Nicholas and Fetuccini."
Oh, thank you so much.
You won't be disappointed,
I promise.
I can't believe this.
I owe it all to Care Bears and...
To who?
Yeah, uh, they're, um, friends, Mr. Fetuccini.
Just friends.
Friends! That's what it's all about, Nicholas, my boy.
That's what it's all about.
MR. CHERRYWOOD:
 No matter what happened,
Nicholas now knew that someone
 would be watching over him
 at all times.
And most important of all,
Nicholas had learned that
the best way to make friends is to be a friend yourself.
TENDERHEART:
Our friends from the Forest of Feelings have proven to everyone that there's always a way to show that you care.
And so the purpose of this festive occasion is to let all bear witness to the inauguration of our friends into the Care Bear family.
(IT'S GREAT TO BE
 IN THE CARE BEAR FAMILY
PLAYING)
* Now all you
 Care Bear Cousins come
* And gather next to me
* We're standing here together
* Just as proud as we can be
* We saved the world
 for carin' folks like you
 and you and me
* And when you care together,
 you become a family

NICHOLAS: And now,
The Amazing Nicholas will pull a dove out of his hat.
That's my boy.
Bravo, Nicky!
Hey, Jason, aren't parents great?
Yeah.
MR. CHERRYWOOD:
And so Kim and Jason found the parents they wanted so very much and lived happily ever after.
And a fine story that was,
Mr. Cherrywood.
My favorite,
Mrs. Cherrywood.
But they never stay awake long enough for the end.
Now they'll never know what eventually became of Nicholas.
I guess all they need to know is that he, too, lived happily ever after.
Happier than I ever thought
I could be.
Nicholas, these children should have been in bed ages ago.
MRS. CHERRYWOOD: What am I ever going to do with you?
Care for me,
Mrs. Cherrywood.
Just care for me.

Once upon this same earth, beneath this same sun, long before you... before the ape and the elephant as well, before the wolf, the bison, the whale, before the mammoth and the mastodon in the time of the dinosaurs.
Come on!
Dinosaurs were of two kinds -
Some had flat teeth and ate the leaves of trees.
Some had sharp teeth for eating meat.
They preyed upon the leaf-eaters.
Then leaves began to die.
The mighty beasts, who appeared to rule earth, were ruled, in truth, by the leaf.
Desperate for food, some dinosaur herds struck out toward the west, searching for their Great Valley, a land still lush and green. lt was a journey toward life. lt was a march of many dangers.
Sharpteeth stalked the herds, waiting to seize any who strayed.
The leaf-eaters stopped only to hatch their young.
Ha.
Aah.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha. Mama.
Hmm.
Mmm.
[Giggling]
Mmm.
Mmm.
[Giggling]
[Grrr]
[Grrr]
Aah!
Ha ha ha.
[Grrr]
Some of the young seemed born without fear.
[Thunder]
Aah!
Yet...
[Arrr] even hatching could be dangerous.
One herd had only a single baby, their last hope for the future.
Ha ha ha.
And they called him...
Littlefoot.
Here l am.
Aw.
Ha ha ha.
Don't be frightened.
Come out.
[Chattering]
Mmm.
Ha ha ha.
All that remained of his herd was his mother, grandmother and his grandfather.
He knew them by sight, by scent and by their love.
He knew they would be together always.
Now, you be careful, my Littlefoot.
Ahh.
Heh heh heh.
Aah.
Beautiful Littlefoot.
Mother, is this all there is to eat? l'm sorry, my dear.
The land has been changing.
That is why we must walk as far as we can each day until we reach the Great Valley.
Littlefoot, quickly, come here.
Look, up there.
A tree star. lt is very special.
[Giggling]
A tree star. lt is very special. lt'll help you grow strong.
Where we are going, there are so many of these leaves.
Come along.
Ha ha ha.
The valley is filled with green food, more than you could ever eat and more cool water than you could ever drink. lt's a wonderful, beautiful place, where we'll live happily with many more of our own kind.
When will we arrive?
The bright circle must pass over many times.
We must follow it to where it touches the ground.
Have you ever seen the Great Valley?
No.
Well, how do you know it's really there?
Some things you see with your eyes, others you see with your heart. l don't understand, Mother.
You will, my son.
You will.
[Giggling]
Littlefoot, don't you wander too far.
Hey!
Ha ha ha!
What are you laughing at?
Oh!
[Honk]
[Grrr]
[Grrr]
[Grrr]
Littlefoot.
Come, Cera.
Three-horns never play with long-necks.
Pffft!
Littlefoot.
[Grrr]
Three-horns never play with long-necks.
A long-neck?
Hmm.
Mother, what's a long-neck?
Why, that's what we are, dear.
Oh. Well, why can't l play with that three-horn?
We were having fun.
We all keep to our own kind -
The three-horns, the spiketails, the swimmers, the fliers.
We never do anything together.
Why?
Well, because we're different. lt's always been that way.
Well, why?
Oh, don't worry so much.
When we reach the Great Valley, there will be many long-necks for you to play with. l wish we were there now. lt's a long way -
Past the rock that looks like a long-neck, the mountains that burn.
Still a long way, but we'll get there.
[Ribbit]
Oh!
[Ribbit]
Hey, hopper, come back!
[Ribbit]
Hey.
You again?
Go away!
That's my hopper. l... l saw him first.
Well, he's in my pond.
[Ribbit]
[Ribbit]
[Ribbit]
[Ribbit]
[Ribbit]
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
[Ribbit]
Over here.
Hey, this is fun.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
[Heavy Footsteps]
Ha ha ha!
Ohh!
Ohh! Sharptooth!
Help!
Mother! Help!
[Grrr]
[Grrr]
[Grrr]
Go.
This way.
Mm-mmm.
Come back.
You're going the wrong way!
Aah!
Whoa!
Ohh!
Mm-ohh!
[Grrr]
Aah!
[Grrr]
Aah!
[Grrr]
[Grrr]
Mother?
Run!
Look out!
Aah!
Ohh!
Oh!
- Help!
- Help!
[Grrr]
Mother!
[Grrr]
Aah!
Aah!
[Grrr]
Daddy!
Aah! ln this time of the clash of continents, an earthquake split the land.
Herds were divided, families were cut in two.
Littlefoot was separated from his grandparents.
Cera!
Mama! Daddy!
Cera was on one side of the divide, her parents were on the other.
Mother!
Mother!
Uh!
Mother?
Where are you?
Oh.
Mother.
Mother?
Oh.
Please get up. l'm... not sure l can, Littlefoot.
Yes, you can.
Get up.
Dear, sweet Littlefoot, do you remember the way to the Great Valley? l guess so, but why do l have to know?
You're going to be with me. l'll be with you, even if you can't see me.
What do you mean if l can't see you? l can always see you.
Littlefoot, let your heart guide you. lt whispers.
So listen closely.
Mother? Mother?
Mmm.
Mmmmm.
Hey!
What's going on here?
[Crying]
What's your problem?
You're not hurt. lt's not fair.
She should have known better.
That was a sharptooth. lt's all her fault.
All whose fault?
Mother's.
Oh... l see. l see.
Why did l wander so far from home?
Oh, it's not your fault. lt's not your mother's fault.
You pay attention to old Rooter. lt is nobody's fault.
The great circle of life has begun, but, you see, not all of us arrive together at the end.
What'll l do? l miss her so much.
You'll always miss her, but she'll always be with you if you remember what she taught you.
You'll never really be apart, for you're still a part of each other.
My tummy hurts.
Well, that, too, will go in time, little fella... only in time.
[Peep]
[Peep]
[Peep Peep Peep]
- [Peep Peep Peep]
- [Peep Peep]
[Peep]
[Peep Peep Peep]
[Peep Peep Peep]
At first,
Littlefoot could only think about his mother.
He hardly noticed his hunger and forgot that he must reach the Great Valley.
[Peep Peep]
[Peep]
[Peep]
Littlefoot.
Littlefoot.
Dear Littlefoot, do you remember the way to the Great Valley?
Follow the bright circle past the great rock that looks like a long-neck and past the mountains that burn. l'll be in your heart,
Littlefoot.
Let your heart guide you.
[Gasp]
Mother.
Mother!
Hee hee hee!
Mother!
Heh heh! lt's you!
Wait, Mother!
Wait!
Then Littlefoot knew for certain that he was alone and that though the Great Valley was far away and the journey perilous, he'd have to find his way, or the chain of life would be broken.
Cera!
Cera, hello.
What do you want?
Nothing. Where are you going? l'm going to find my own kind.
They're on the other side.
You can't climb up the other side.
Maybe you can't.
Uhh!
Uhh! l'm going to the Great Valley.
We could... help each other.
Ha! A three-horn...
Uhh! does not need help from a long-neck.
[Gasp]
Aah!
W... well, at least we wouldn't be alone.
Well, when l find my sisters, l won't be alone, so go away.
Three-horns can be very dangerous.
They only talk with other three-horns, and they only travel with other three-horns.
Hello. l said hello.
What is your name?
Maybe you cannot talk yet.
Huh? Huh?
Don't you know anything?
Long-necks don't talk to, uh, whatever you are.
Me? l'm a long-neck, too. See?
And l have a long tail like you.
All right... l'm not a long-neck. l'm a bigmouth, but l am all alone. l am. l lost my family in the big earthshake.
Um... you want to go with me?
Yeah! Oh.
Oh, yes, yes, yes! l do, l do!
All right.
Come on... but you have to keep up. l will keep up. l will.
[Hums]
Where are we going?
To the Great Valley. l won't stop until l find my grandparents.
Do you think my family went to the Great Valley, too?
Maybe. My mother said it's where all the herds were going.
Oh, l hope. l hope.
My name's Littlefoot.
Mine is Ducky.
Yep, that's what it is.
Hmm hmm
Hmm hmm hmm
Dee dee dee
Doo doo
Doo doo
Da da da doo
Da dee dee
Doo doo
Da da dee dee
Doo doo
Dee dee
Dee da da dee
Dee doo doo
Doo doo doo da
Don't step on a crack, or you'll fall and break your back.
[Growl]
Heh heh.
My stomach is talking.
Mine, too.
Hmm. l wonder what this tastes like.
Aah!
The tree is talking.
No, it isn't.
You should not eat talking trees.
Nope, nope, nope.
Brlrblblrb! Oooh!
Aaooh!
Hee hee.
Aah!
- Waah!
- Aah!
Aah!
Who are you? Huh?
M... my name Petrie.
Petrie, huh?
Funny name.
Uh, l.. l flied?
No.
You falled. l falled?
Ohh!
You cannot fly?
How did you get up there? l climb.
But you're a flier, not a faller.
Hard thing to fly. l guess it is.
We can't do it.
Nope, we cannot.
[Gasp]
Uhh!
Aah!
Uhh!
Uhh!
Aah!
Mm hmm hmm
Hmm hmm
Shh! Quiet.
[Grrr]
Stay low.
[Grrr]
Ow!
Hey!
Petrie!
Get off!
You got nice flat head, Flathead.
My name is not Flathead.
My name is Littlefoot.
Littlefoot? Hmm.
Are you just going to stay up there?
Yes.
Well, you can't.
You're tearing my tree star. lt is very special.
His mother gave it to him.
She did.
Ooh! Mother present very important. l keep safes.
Don't let nobodies touch.
Yep, Petrie, you keep it safe. Yep.
Nope. l'm not a carrier.
Get off!
You're a flier.
Start flying.
B...b...b...but... waah!
Waah! Aah! Aah!
Open your wings, Petrie!
Open! Open!
No can do this!
You can fly!
Open your skinny wings!
Petrie, higher!
Higher like a flier!
Danger!
Where, Petrie?
Th-th-there! Ahead!
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
Aah!
Cera! lt's you!
What happened?
Why are you so frightened?
Frightened?
Me?
Ha ha ha!
Why are you so frightened?
We're not frightened... are we?
Nope, nope.
Well, you should be. l could be with the other three-horns, but l came back to warn you. l met the sharptooth!
Sharptooth!
Ooh!
Come on, Cera.
Sharptooth is dead.
He fell down into the big underground.
And that's... where he met me.
Oh!
Dear, brave Cera.
Dear, brave Cera.
Yes, l am brave.
Sharptooth is dead!
My father told me that flatheads had very small brains. l was all alone with him in the dark, just the sharptooth and me. l could hear him breathing.
[Hrrahh]
- [Hrraaahh]
- Aah! l could see his one big ugly eye looking for me.
[Gasp]
[Hrrahh]
What did you do?
Huh? Huh? l walked right up to him. l looked him straight in the eye and said...
[Hrraah]
Aah!
Whoa!
Uhh!
[Snoring]
Ducky!
Hello.
[Snoring]
Hello?
You should come out.
You should.
You are late.
Yes, you are.
Yep, yep, yep.
Come out!
You are all alone.
Are you not scared? Huh?
[Yawn]
We're going to the Great Valley.
You could go with us. Yes.
Uh, you are a spiketail, so we will call you Spike.
Ducky!
So the five hungry dinosaurs left for the Great Valley.
There had never been such a herd before.
A long-neck, a three-horn, a bigmouth, a flier, and a spiketail,
All knowing that if they lost their way, they would starve or find themselves in sharptooth's shadow.
Hmm. Tree stars grow where there's lots of water. lf we follow this water...
[Sniff Sniff]
Hmm. No green foods here, and l still hungry. l'm still hungry, too.
Aah!
[Sniff Sniff]
Can you smell something?
[Sniff Sniff] l...l... l smell... l smell... l smell...
Hmm. Ducky.
You smell me? Heh heh. l smell water. l smell... tree stars!
Oh, look!
Green food!
The Great Valley! l found it!
Cera, stop it! l found it!
[Rumbling]
Earthshake!
We've got to get out of here!
That way! Come on!
Help!
Spike, hurry up!
Ducky, Spike, get out of there!
[Gasp]
[Gasp]
They're eating our food!
Look, look what they're doing!
They're so greedy!
What about me? l'm still hungry!
Haah! You hungry? l empty to the top.
We at the Great Valley and still no foods.
We be hungry forevers.
Ohh!
No, Petrie.
Cera was wrong.
This isn't the Great Valley.
Oh, it is not a great anything.
Nope, nope, nope.
We better go down and see if anything's left.
Petrie, could you fly up there and...
No!
Petrie, do not feel sad.
Many things do not fly.
Rocks, trees, sticks,
Spike.
Waah!
- Hey!
- No!
Ducky, push Petrie towards the branches.
Ohh!
Ok, Spike, not too fast.
Whoa!
Ok. Hey, not too fast.
Hey, not too fast!
- Aah!
- Aah!
Aah!
You four look so ridiculous.
Ha ha ha ha!
Ohh!
Ducky, Petrie, come down here!
We've got green food!
Fly, Petrie!
Aah!
Fly, Petrie!
Flap your wings!
[Awk] l flied?
Come on, Cera.
We've got green food. l can get my own green food.
See? l can take care of myself... all by myself.
And l'm not afraid to be alone! l know my way to go, and l'm not afraid of sharptooth! l hope he doesn't eat any of you.
Don't worry.
There isn't any sharptooth.
[Gasp]
Sharptooth!
Spike.
Ahem.
[Sigh]
There isn't any sharptooth.
Mmm.
Mmm.
[Thud]
Ohh!
[Grrr]
[Grrr]
Wake up.
Wake up!
Wake up!
Hey, stop that.
Shh! lt's sharptooth.
Cera, stop it.
Shh! He'll eat us.
He'll eat us! Run!
Come back!
Don't look back!
Keep going!
Aah!
Now will you believe me?
We're safe now.
Nobody's safe with you.
Look. That rock looks like a long-neck, like my mother said.
We're going the right way, the way to the Great Valley!
Littlefoot had been wrong about the sharptooth, but the others followed.
Their only hope was the Great Valley.
Littlefoot alone knew the way.
Come on. Get up.
We're going the right way.
We got to keep moving.
You can't quit.
What if the Great Valley is just over these rocks?
Though they were sore-stumped and tired,
Littlefoot urged them on.
He'd never seen the Great Valley, but his heart told him they were close.
Surely at the top, they'd behold it.
This is your Great Valley?
You're crazy. l'm leaving.
Cera, we have to keep following the bright circle. l'm taking the easy way. lt's the wrong way.
Who says?
My mother.
Then she was stupid, too.
Take that back.
Never.
Take it back!
No!
Spike!
Spike, stop!
Don't fall!
You!
Let go of my leg!
Spike.
Take that!
Huh!
Go on!
Go the wrong way.
We never wanted you with us anyway.
Come on.
We have to keep going.
Come on.
Cera's way is easier. l think so, too.
Oh, Flathead, wait!
Ooh! Aah! Ow!
No be angry.
Wait!
Cera, wait for us!
We're coming with you, Cera!
Cera, Spike, wait! l wish Littlefoot was here with us now.
Me, too.
Spike.
Spike, do not stop.
We must stay together.
A... a... a... aah!
Aah!
Whoa! Cera, l...
Whoa! Oh, Cera,
Ducky, Spike!
Help!
Help, Cera!
Cera, where are you?
Littlefoot!
Ducky!
Littlefoot!
Hang on! l'm coming!
Littlefoot!
Quick, this way!
Hang on, Petrie!
Help!
Ooh!
Ducky! Spike!
Oh, Petrie am so happy.
Jump, Petrie!
Help, Ducky!
Petrie, pull!
Petrie.
Aah!
Help!
Help!
Aah!
Aah! Help me!
Help!
Woo!
Get away from me!
Aah!
Let go of me!
Help!
Help!
Petrie, Spike, Ducky, help!
Cera, it is us.
Aah!
Ha ha ha! l knew it was you all along. l did!
Oh, get out of my way.
Cera?
Cera, come back!
Come back!
Cera was still too proud to admit that... she'd gone the wrong way.
[Crying]
[Grrr]
Aah!
Sharptooth! lt's sharptooth.
Let's get rid of him for good.
We'll coax him to deep water.
He can't swim with scrawny arms.
Me and Spike will push that rock on his head.
He'll fall into the water.
Petrie, whistle when he's where the water gets dark.
Now we need some bait.
Hmm.
Me?
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no.
[Grrr]
Hm... hm... hm... hm...
[Grrr]
Aah!
[Grrr]
Ducky!
Ducky!
[Whistles]
Push, Spike, with all your might!
Ha ha ha!
Petrie! l flying. l flying! l flying!
Help!
Petrie! l'm coming!
Cera, you're back!
Aah!
He was my friend.
Poor Petrie.
Poor, poor Petrie.
Petrie.
[Gasping]
Stop!
You go without Petrie?
Petrie.
Oh!
Petrie, you're safe!
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep!
Littlefoot.
Littlefoot.
Mother!
Littlefoot.
Mother? l tried to do what you told me, but it's just too hard. l'll never find the Great Valley.
[Wind Blows]
Mother. Mother!
Don't go, Mother!
Don't go!
The Great Valley.
Cera, Spike,
Ducky, Petrie, over here!
Littlefoot, you found it!
Yep, yep, yep.
We did it.
We did it together!
The Great Valley was all they dreamed it would be:
A land of green, leaves and life.
There were waterfalls, grassy meadows, enough tree stars to feast on forever and raising upon them, their families.
This is our new brother Spike.
Mama, l a flier!
- Yay!
- Yay!
Daddy!
Cera?
Daddy.
And Littlefoot found his grandmother and grandfather at last.
The same loving faces he'd looked into on the day of his birth.
Littlefoot! Come on. l'll race you.
And they all grew up together in the valley.
Generation upon generation, each passing on to the next the tale of their ancestors' journey to the valley... long ago.
Don't lose your way
With each passing day
You've come so far
Don't throw it away
Live believing
Dreams are for weaving
Wonders are waiting to start
Live your story
Faith, hope, and glory
Hold to the truth in your heart lf we hold on
Together l know our dreams

Dreams see us through

Where clouds roll by
For you and l
Souls in the wind
Must learn how to bend
Seek out a star
Hold on till the end

There is a fountain
Washes our tears all away
Worlds are swaying
Someone is praying
Please let us come home to stay lf we hold on
Together l know our dreams

Where clouds roll by
For you and l
When we are out there ln the dark
We'll dream about the sun ln the dark
We'll feel the light
Warm our hearts
Every one lf we hold on
Together l know our dreams will never die
Dreams see us through to forever
As high as souls can fly

And her ambition was to extend her realm...
to all the regions of the known world.
To this end, she gathered an army.
And she bore a son and named him Nekron.
And him she tutored in the black arts
and in the powers of the mind.
And when Nekron came of age...
and attained mastery of those powers...
together they seized control
of the region of Ice.
And from their castle called Ice Peak...
they sent a giant glacier
rumbling southward.
No village or people could stand
against its relentless onslaught.
And so the remnants of humanity
fled south...
and huddled for warmth
among the volcanoes...
of a mountain region
ruled by a generous king named Jarol...
from his fortress,
which men called Fire Keep.
And still Nekron
pushed the Ice ever southward...
into the temperate zone toward Fire Keep.
And no one dared guess at the outcome...
of a meeting on the field of battle...
between Fire and Ice.
Hold your positions, men. Steady.
Lam, it cannot be stopped.
Join your brother.
You have done well, my son.
The North Village has fallen. We have won.
I want to thank you, Mother.
The Great Plain is all that stands between ourselves and Fire Keep.
That is a long distance.
A distance we may not have to travel.
I am sending our envoys to Jarol with our new demands.
- He will not submit.
- Perhaps.
You will present our demands to King Jarol at Fire Keep and... give our royal regards to his lovely daughter.
But, Father, I want to be with you when you meet Nekron's men.
You will serve your people better here with your studies, my daughter.
Give me your love.
You have it always, Father.
All matter in our world is from the natural bases... which are earth, air, fire and water.
The four elements from which all things are created.
How can you talk about elements when the war draws nearer to us ever hour?
Princess Teegra, we all have our duty.
Your father's duty is to be king and lead.
Your brother's duty is to soldier.
And your duty is to learn.
You mean my duty is to stay shut up... while all the men do the fighting and share all the glory.
We think that stinks.
Don't we, Shaitan?
If you peacefully surrender, my lord Nekron will cease the destruction of...
This is your message of peace?
A demand for our total and unconditional surrender?
We call it an offer of alliance, Your Majesty.
I call it blackmail.
My lord Nekron's offer...
To hell with Nekron and his offer.
We are free men, not slaves.
King Jarol, be reasonable.
My son, Taro, speaks more with his heart than with his head.
But he speaks for all of us.
There can be no alliance.
We will fight you to the death.
Perhaps, you will soon change your mind.
No!
Teegra!
Guards!
Make for the glacier. Man the Dragonhawks.
Hurry!
The Dragonhawks will find her, Father.
They've got to.
The night's so dark, the jungle so thick.
A bird couldn't find its own nest.
- What do we do then, Father?
- We wait.
- For Nekron's new demands?
- For his siege!
What is your report?
Have you done as I commanded?
Have you captured the girl, Teegra,
Jarol's daughter?
Where is she?
Bring her forth that I may see her.
- Gone.
- Gone?
Gone!
Escaped? You filth-spawned scum!
What punishment does failure demand?
Death.
Find the girl.
Find her, or his punishment shall be yours.
Gods of my father.
What do you want?
If you want it, take it.
I am not a thief.
Not so close, you'll burn it.
I've always lived close to a fire.
Sometimes in the night, I'm so afraid.
It's getting colder.
- Cold comes from Nekron.
- I know.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going home to my people.
- Where is home?
- Far away, to the south.
- I'm going south, too.
- Yeah?
You can come along if you behave yourself.
If I behave myself?
No.
Larn.
You've caught me, but you'll never hand me over to Nekron.
You'll have to kill me first.
Don't hunt for death, boy.
It finds us all soon enough.
The travois was to keep you from killing yourself till you're all healed.
You need rest and food.
If you're gonna kill the Ice Lord, boy, you better learn to live with pain.
Ice Lord? You mean you're fighting Nekron?
Him and his mother.
That wolf bitch, Juliana.
Teegra!
They were here.
Nekron's dogs, they got the girl.
They took her west.
Guard Teegra.
They camped less than two miles from here.
Come.
I saw the girl before.
She is on the far side of the big tree.
You go get her out, and I'll distract the others.
- There must be 50 of them.
- That sounds about right.
- Where's the girl?
- I couldn't find her.
- No!
- The horses!
No, they'd be on our heels before we could reach them.
- But Teegra's still back there.
- Then we'll come back for her.
First, we lead the Nekron's dogs on a wild chase.
Come.
We'll take our stand up there. Come.
Enough!
I want you to go to Nekron, to his mother, Juliana.
- We must negotiate.
- With the enemy?
No man is wholly evil.
Surely there is some way to appeal to Nekron.
You expect his mercy?
Father, do you know what he will do if I enter his land under a flag of truce?
We have no choice!
We must take that risk.
You must take that risk, my son, for the sake of Fire Keep.
For the sake of your sister.
Go, ride swiftly.
Welcome to my hearth.
I am Roliel and these woods are my home.
You've had a trying journey.
Please let me give you some food and drink.
First, you shall rest. Then we will talk.
Poor, poor darling.
Did Great Otwa frighten you?
You mustn't be afraid.
He's as gentle as a child.
I saw him twist a chain apart with his bare hands.
Yes, he is strong, my sweet.
But he means well, my darling.
He brought you to me, did he not?
I'm so tired.
Yes, my poor, poor darling.
Yes, you're so tired... and so beautiful.
You must...
Tell me your secrets.
Nekron?
The girl is wanted by Nekron? The bitch!
She brings danger into my house!
Perhaps I can turn this to my advantage.
Otwa, my son.
Go and bring the subhumans,
Nekron's dogs.
Tell them we have the girl that he wants.
Tell them he can have her, for a price.
Kill.
Get out of here.
- No.
- The hell you won't.
Go find the girl.
Enter, my son. It is not barred.
What's wrong with you?
Where are the dogs?
You would do this...
Why do the living... disturb the sleep of the dead?
I followed a trail. I seek a girl, Teegra.
A girl?
Yes. She did this to me.
She and Nekron.
Cursed Nekron.
Where can I find her?
- Why should I answer?
- For revenge against Nekron.
Nekron?
Akatar. They take her to Akatar.
And from there to the Icy King's realm.
Avenge me.
Avenge me!
Akatar.
Teegra!
My Prince, all is arranged.
I've hired a ship. It waits for us at the dock.
Nekron waits at Ice Peak.
Get the gangplanks aboard.
Move, you scum!
We must be well on our way before sunrise.
Why have you brought me this?
This is your bride, my son.
She will be mother to your sons.
How thoughtful, Mother.
I need no bride, and no sons.
- But you need heirs.
- I need nothing!
Nekron?
Nekron, you're a great power in the world.
You have all that any man ever wants or needed.
And yet you despair.
For there is one thing you lack.
One gift that only you can bestow between our people.
Peace.
This is the gift that heals the heart of the giver.
Nekron, I extend my hand in friendship.
I offer peace between our people.
Will you not take my hand?
Will you not call me friend?
Woman...
I spit on peace.
I spit on you.
Next time you present me with one of your little sluts, Mother dear...
I'll squash you like a bug.
Get that garbage out of here.
Don't look up.
We are riders of Fire Keep.
We pay no heed to such trash.
We have come, Lord Nekron, to negotiate between our two peoples.
And the return to Fire Keep of my sister, Teegra... whom your warriors basely kidnapped.
My father, King Jarol, has empowered me... to offer a peace between our kingdoms... in exchange for his continued sovereignty... and my sister's freedom.
It seems to me that my envoys made a similar offer not long since... and that it was spurned by your illustrious sire.
You know full well, Nekron, that offer was made... before your minions kidnapped my sister.
I fear, Good Prince,
I cannot offer peace to a people... who have refused to proclaim me their rightful overlord.
As to your sister...
I must admit that until this moment... the idea of mating with her filled me with loathing.
Perhaps I should reconsider.
Your sister, after all, is not wholly unattractive.
As lesser beasts go.
Pig you are.
And like a pig shall you die.
No!
No, I don't think so.
You interest me.
Guards!
Bring him to me.
Release him.
- Why have you come seeking me?
- You killed my people.
We've had to dispose of so many undesirables of late.
Let him rest. There is still fight in him.
Larn.
Teegra, is that you?
- Teegra, are you all right?
- Yes. I'm trying to unlock the door.
Never mind the door, you've to get out of here.
I'm not leaving without you.
Maybe I can get a key somehow.
No, Teegra, don't.
Is he certain?
- It was my son you saw?
- They called him Prince Taro.
He died.
- What about Teegra?
- He's got her, too.
Maybe she's still alive.
It's a chance.
Believe what you want, but that glacier is a fact.
For three days and nights it's been pushing south.
A thousand souls lost because of Nekron's rage.
Fire Keep is next. We must attack.
I need the Dragonhawks.
- The Dragonhawks are too few.
- Enough to get in with.
One us might get through and destroy him.
But if that glacier passes beyond the river,
I will have no choice.
I will have to release the lava.
Teegra.
Larn.
Nekron!
Die! Die! Why don't you die?
No, Larn! No, it's over, don't you see?
We have to start over.
Hear you now...
...a story of good against evil.
An epoch that has its beginning at an ending...
...and ends at a beginning.
Listen, as we speak of the fall of a lord of darkness...
...and the return of a king of light.
Concern yourselves with armies and wizards...
...phantoms and emperors...
...cloud-capped towers and bloodied fields of horrendous carnage.
Consider no less...
...than the cataclysmic transformation...
...of that ancient world of wonder and magic...
...to the world we know now, of Man.
What mighty lord, you may ask, is hero enough...
...to evoke such cosmic metamorphosis?
Why, no lord at all, but the littlest of fellows...
...Frodo the Hobbit...
...and his faithful squire, Samwise.
Who, beginning at the ending, now approach Rivendell...
...the Elvish home of Elrond...
...there to help celebrate the 129th birthday...
...of Frodo's aged kin...
...Bilbo Baggins, renowned tormentor of dragons.
Bless my soul!
You're a match for Smaug himself.
All of us, Frodo and Samwise...
...their Hobbit companions,
Merry and Pippin...
...Elrond the Elf-Lord, and I, Gandalf...
...wished Bilbo only the best.
But as we celebrated far into the Elvish night...
...we found it difficult to keep our aging guest of honor awake.
Nay, Pippin. Not till Bilbo has cut it.
Blast. What a time to fall asleep.
Who's asleep?
Just resting my eyes...
...and remembering.
There And Back Again...
...and what happened after.
Remembering, sir?
So many things.
Old Smaug...
...dear Thorin...
...that terrible Gollum chap...
...the Ring of Invisibility.
What's become of my ring?
That ring I gave you and you took away.
Yes.
I've lost it, Bilbo dear.
I got rid of it, you know.
Pity. I should have liked to see it again.
But...
...now, how silly of me.
That's what you went for, wasn't it?
To get rid of it.
But why destroy a thing of such wondrous magic?
It was an evil thing, sir.
Nay!
Without its powers...
...I could never have faced the worm, Smaug.
You unwittingly used its evil forces for good, dear Uncle.
Your innocence protected you.
But had you continued to wear it...
...instead of keeping it above your mantle as a trophy...
...its ever-growing malignancy would have consumed you...
...as it almost consumed Samwise and me and the whole of Middle-earth.
But this is all so confusing.
So confusing.
- Will he never cut the cake?
- Patience, Merry.
Me for a good smoke, while we wait.
- What say, master?
- Good notion, Sam.
Bless my soul!
You are missing a finger!
You not only lost my ring...
...you lost the finger on which it rode?
Frodo, you must explain.
We have brought with us someone...
...who has written a ballad about the adventures of Frodo:
The Minstrel of Gondor.
"Frodo of the nine fingers
"And the Ring of Doom"
It has its beginnings two ages past...
...when Bilbo set forth to reclaim the Dwarves' gold...
...from the dragon, Smaug.
While on his quest,
Bilbo stumbled into a deep, dank cave.
This part I remember.
"When Bilbo found that shiny ring
"In Gollum's cave of gloom
"He never thought
"That it would turn into a ring of doom
"The dragon Smaug
The spiders too
"The Goblins, the Elven-king
"They came to know the power
"Of the Hobbit and his ring
"Frodo of the nine fingers
"And the Ring of Doom
"It started with a Hobbit
"In Gollum's cave of gloom
"The power of the Ring, it grew
"And Gandalf sat in thought
"He knew that it must be destroyed
"In fires where it was wrought
"For if in evil hands it fell
"The Earth would know its end
"No force of arms would win the day
"No army could contend"
For evil flourished everywhere...
...and lay on the land like a festering malignancy.
There was one hope, though:
In a distant land, the noble Aragorn...
...heir to the empty throne of Gondor...
...awaited with a small band to return and become king.
But he could not triumph until the Ring was destroyed.
So went the prophecy.
"Frodo of the nine fingers
"And the Ring of Doom
"Accepted a heavy burden
"For the fires to consume"
Frodo and his gallant companion, Samwise...
...had many brave adventures...
...until finally they reached the rocky border of Mordor...
...domain of the Black Lord, Sauron.
There, Frodo was captured and imprisoned in the Tower of Cirith Ungol.
Samwise vowed to enter the Orc-infested tower alone...
...to save him.
The Ring of Doom was missing...
...from 'round Frodo's neck!
"Frodo of the nine fingers
"And the Ring of Doom
"Why does he have nine fingers?
"Where is the Ring of Doom?"
One tiny Hobbit against all the evil the world could muster.
A sane being would have given up.
But Samwise burned with a magnificent madness...
...a glowing obsession to surmount every obstacle...
...to find Frodo, destroy the Ring, and cleanse Middle-earth...
...of its festering malignancy.
He knew he would try again, fail perhaps and try once more...
...a thousand, thousand times, if need be.
But he would not give up the quest.
You cannot die, Master Frodo!
I'll get to you somehow!
You. I can feel you throbbing with excitement!
You know the gates to the land of Mordor and your dark lord, Sauron.
Now I must bear your loathsome weight.
But I do it for he who lies in that accursed tower...
...Cirith Ungol:
My sweet master, Frodo.
And, 'tis Sting...
...Master Frodo's sword.
And his hero's cloak!
Lost 'em with the Ring while doing battle, he did.
They're safe with me till I find you again, master!
He can't hear.
Half dead, behind walls of stone.
Serve me, Sting, till I can return you.
Here now.
What's this?
Dank and foul-smelling...
...but it may be a way in.
I've got through!
So I've finally crossed into Mordor.
Orcs in the tower!
Old Bilbo called them Goblins.
But whatever the name,
I loathe the vile creatures.
Fighting among themselves?
I could get in!
They wouldn't notice me!
The Ring holds me back?
True.
Once the Orcs saw me...
...they'd forget their own arguments for the head of an enemy!
Useless to face such odds.
Don't take any chances.
Destroy the thing yourself.
I do it for you, Frodo!
I must be ring bearer now!
"The bearer of the Ring
"The wearer of the Ring
"Stands on the very brink of fate
"Staring into eyes of darkness and despair
"That rise and shrink with hate"
I can feel you change as we draw near the great furnaces...
...where in the depths of time, you were shaped and formed.
Mount Doom!
I could claim you, Ring!
I would be Samwise the Strong!
"The bearer of the Ring
"The wearer of the Ring
"He hears a voice compelling him
"Filling him with thoughts
That echo in his mind
"It should be telling him
"Beware the power is a power never known
"Beware the power that was simple
"Now has grown
"Beware, bearer of the Ring
"The final power has yet to be shown
"The bearer of the Ring
"The wearer of the Ring
"Through forces tempting to resist
"Must recall the quest
"To end this darkest age
"That mortal death has kissed
"The bearer of the Ring
"The wearer of the Ring
"Beware who wears the Ring"
Hail Samwise the Strong!
Hail the Conqueror!
Hail the War-King!
Hero of the Age!
To the Dark Tower!
To Barad-dur!
I claim thee, Barad-dur!
You are Sauron's no more!
Hail Samwise the Strong!
The sun shines for thee alone!
And now I claim all of the Vale of Gorgoroth!
Now let this foul desolation...
...this cursed plateau of the Dark Lord, Sauron...
...this Orc-infested, desert of nameless horrors...
...let it blossom forth, and live!
Let it live for Samwise the Strong!
Samwise the Strong!
Behold!
The gardens of my delight!
So I shall transform the world!
All could be mine...
...if I but claim thee, Ring!
No!
What brought me back?
Plain Hobbit sense.
I know in my heart I'm not enough to bear such a burden.
One small garden of a free gardener...
...is all my need and due.
My own hands to use...
...not the hands of others to command.
No, such a quest is not for me.
Frodo lives.
And only he knows how to destroy the Ring...
...in the Cracks of Doom.
Only he can find the fire.
Dear Master Frodo.
I will find you.
Somehow.
An ancient world of towered fortress cities.
Cirith Ungol...
...guarding the entrance to the lands of Mordor.
Barad-dur, palace of the Dark Lord, Sauron.
And now, look you to yet another.
Minas-Tirith, chief city of Gondor...
...last bastion of hope for the powers of light and good.
From the battlement atop the citadel, like a mariner in a mountainous ship...
...one could look sheer down upon the gate 700 feet below.
And still this was not the top.
Behold! The White Tower.
At the top, the banner of the stewards who governed the city...
...its silken arms embracing a domain more fitting Gwaihir...
...Lord of the Eagles than those whose emblem it bore.
All this, Minas-Tirith was.
But now, under siege, the sparkling gem of Gondor...
...had become dull and flawed with the hell of war.
The once-lush fields of Pelennor, now a wasted battleground...
...upon which Sauron's forces of evil celebrated their victories.
Far superior in number to the battle-ravaged Gondor forces...
...they mounted their monster oliphaunts...
...to ride in the rocking, armored towers, to their almost certain victory.
And in the heavens, where no living thing dare now venture...
...Sauron's phantom lieutenants, the Nazgul, astride their devil steeds...
...scream battle cries of vile encouragement.
High in the White Tower, Lord Denethor,
Chief Steward of Gondor...
...his mind broken as his city crumbled about him...
...had succumbed to an eerie fire of the brain...
...and, in his madness, ordered his own execution.
- You must stop him!
- His word is law!
I'll find Gandalf!
The Hobbit, Pippin, who had proved a most valuable assistant for me...
...rushed to the battlement.
Where I, Gandalf...
...and the Gondor generals searched the distance in vain...
...for a sign of our rescuers.
For we awaited Theoden...
...a valuable ally, lord of the friendly nation of Rohan...
...for whom we had dispatched
Pippin's Hobbit friend, little Merry...
...to inform him of our perilous condition and to beseech his aid.
For we wondered, would he and his armies come to our rescue?
Forward! To Minas-Tirith!
Forward!
For only Theoden could save our city...
...and make it safe for the return of Aragorn.
But we feared he would come too late.
- What? Denethor?
- He's gone loony, I tell you!
Come quickly.
You cannot do this!
Soon all shall be burned.
The West has failed.
It shall go up in a great fire...
...and all shall be ended.
Ash and smoke blown away on the wind.
All shall not be ended.
Theoden's forces are on their way!
Pride and despair!
Pride and despair!
Didst thou think the eyes of the White Tower were blind?
I have looked inside my palantir.
- What is that?
- Palantir. The stuff of wizards.
A crystal ball to see the future.
I have seen more than thou knowest, gray fool.
Thy hope is but ignorance.
Even with the forces of Theoden, there is no hope.
Go forth and fight!
Vanity!
For a little space you may triumph on the field...
...for a day.
But against the dark power...
...that now rises, there is no victory.
To this dying city, only the first fingers of its hand...
...have yet been stretched.
All the East is moving!
And even now, the wind of thy hope cheats thee...
...and wafts up an enemy fleet with black sails.
Up the Great River, Anduin they come, even now.
The river which leads to the edge...
...of the Pelennor Fields.
A black fleet? A devil's armada?
- Do those palantir things ever lie?
- Never!
The West has failed!
It is time for all to depart this life...
...who would not be slaves!
Servants, come hither!
So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.
And so pass also the days of Gondor.
For good or evil they have ended.
You must take charge, Gandalf.
You must lead our forces now...
...until Aragorn returns to claim the throne of Gondor.
If he returns.
Gandalf, you...
I saw the vision in the palantir.
A dark fleet.
- Is there no hope?
- None.
Unless the Ring be destroyed.
But alas, it is lost with its bearer, Frodo.
All is gone.
I, Gandalf was without hope.
For I did not know that at that very moment...
...at that other towered fortress...
...the future of all good in the world...
...rested upon the wits and the tiny shoulders...
...of poor little Samwise...
...who, still undetected by the Orcs within...
...approached the gates of the Tower of Cirith Ungol.
But to get through those gates...
...he would have to pass the Two Watchers.
Though carved from huge blocks of solid stone...
...some dreadful spirit of evil vigilance abode in them...
...and they were aware.
My imagination's running away with me.
They're made of stone.
What harm can they do?
Don't get too cocky, Samwise.
Orcs aren't made of stone, and they have ears.
Though where the blazes are they?
I thought the tower was full of them.
But they give me the shivers.
Forget about them.
Get past as quick as I can!
Bless my soul.
Like some invisible gate.
That's how the Watchers keep guard.
Blast!
How do I get through, or climb over, or under something I can't see?
How?
Ouch!
Something's burning me.
What's this? A phial?
And what magic is in it to make it glow so?
They're opening up!
Thank you, old boys.
It was bad manners you showed me before.
Handy, this thing.
An alarm! That's done it.
I'm ready for you.
Tell your captains that a great Elf warrior has called...
...with his Elf blade!
They're all dead.
Why?
The tower was crawling with them just a few hours ago.
Looks like they were fighting among themselves.
But what for?
There's a lot less of you left to attack Minas-Tirith!
Goodbye and good riddance!
The whole tower climbs backwards-like.
I'll follow these lights.
This must be the entrance to the top tier.
Frodo can't be far away.
An Orc! They're not all dead!
Kill him! Bone him! Boil him!
There's a sweet one for you!
Split him in two!
Can't let him have the Ring!
No!
What the blazes made him do that?
Come back here!
No!
The great Elf warrior is loose! Stop.
Stop, or I'll skin you alive!
Mercy!
I'll think about it!
I have some questions, filthy one.
Yes? I'll tell you anything.
The Hobbit, Frodo, is he still alive?
If anything still lives here, he does.
What happened here?
Why all this carnage?
Our captains made battle and ordered us to fight also.
What was in contest?
The Hobbit's pretty coat...
...when he reveals its hiding place.
You killed each other for that blasted cloak?
Well, I have it! Not Frodo.
You?
You're just a Hobbit.
- Give me the coat.
- Get back!
This must be the top.
Anything above?
Yes.
There is something!
Frodo!
Stop that, you pig!
Frodo.
Dear master. Frodo.
You live.
You live!
- Am I still dreaming?
- No dream, master.
It's real. I've come.
Sam. Dear Sam.
I feel like a child at rest.
When night fears are driven away.
By some loved voice.
Come, Mr. Frodo.
I still must get you out of this place.
Please, dear master, wake up.
They hovered over me.
Gloating, fingering their knives.
The whips, their claws, their eyes...
Don't think about it.
Let me help you to your feet.
Oh, dear. The quest.
The quest has failed.
Failed? No, sir.
Yes. The Ring is gone, dear Sam.
Even if we could get out of here, we can't escape.
For evil is everywhere.
And only Elves can escape Middle-earth.
They board the white ships at the Gray Havens...
...and sail off to the lands beyond.
Don't even think of passing on!
The quest has not failed, master!
You don't understand.
The Orcs took everything!
Not everything. Look.
You've got it? You've got it here?
You must have lost it in the struggle.
I found it.
Samwise, you are a marvel!
I'll keep it 'round my neck...
...for it's too heavy for you to bear in your condition.
Give it to me at once! You can't have it!
All right, Mr. Frodo. Here it is.
"Beware the power is a power never known
"Beware the power that was simple now has grown
"Beware"
You filthy, slimy thief!
- I have the power now.
- Master, no.
Don't say such things. Please don't.
It's the Ring.
Sam. What have I said?
What have I done? Forgive me.
I'd forgotten its malevolent trickery.
I'm fine now. Fine. Sam, forgive me.
I must carry the burden to the end.
It can't be altered.
You can't come between...
...me and this doom.
As you wish, master.
I also have found Sting.
Might I keep it with me a little longer?
I have the strength to use it.
And you, with your wound and all...
Yes, of course, dear Sam.
And your cloak which I wear.
In a pocket I found this.
It has powers.
It got me past the Watchers. What is it?
The Phial of Galadriel! I can say no more.
If I betray the trust and give the secret, its powers will die.
- I understand.
- But now we must get out of here quickly.
I know the chain mail's heavy for you.
But we may need it.
And I can't leave anything behind, so I'll wear the Orc garb over my own.
Don't we make a fine, matching pair.
Now, off to Mount Doom.
Hope you've made inquiries about inns along the road?
- Inns, master?
- For food and drink.
Only the best for two fine Orcs.
There's nothing, master, and you know it well.
Save for the few crumbs of cake and drops of water left in my pack.
Courage, Sam. That's enough to start on.
The food we might manage, but the water's going to be bad business.
We'll make it.
But we'd best start, or a whole lake of it won't do us any good!
No, I'm all right. It's the mail.
I'll get used to it. Come.
I'm going to faint, Sam.
I don't know what's come over me.
It's that invisible gate.
There's some devilry there.
But I got through once.
Now for it!
It's still there!
This is not working.
They were expecting it!
Their will is strong.
It needs helping.
We've broken the Watchers' will!
We've still a chance, Samwise.
There's still a chance to destroy the Ring.
- A Black Rider. The Nazgul.
- Run, Mr. Frodo.
Not that way! There's a drop, follow me.
Careful, Mr. Frodo.
I can't. Not another step.
We must keep going, master.
The Nazgul is in charge of the Tower now!
A Black Rider is not so easy to fool as the Orcs.
Just give me a moment.
Begging your pardon, sir, but there's no time.
Listen as the foul flying demon...
...gives alarm to the whole Vale of Gorgoroth!
He's rallying the dark forces to defend the Tower.
Soon they'll be upon us.
We've got to get away and hide!
Yes, of course, dear Sam.
Listen.
We'd best get across the bridge, while we've still time.
If Sauron himself was to offer me a glass of water, I'd shake his hand.
Don't say such things.
It only makes it worse.
Sam.
A spot of dizziness there. I'm sorry.
'Tis a long time, Mr. Frodo, since I had a proper sleep.
Come, Sam, we shall support each other.
It's no good, Sam.
I can't manage the weight of this mail shirt.
It's of no use anyway.
We shall never get through by fighting.
We may have some to do.
We won't take on armies.
Who knows what's down here in this canyon...
...slithering behind the rocks?
No, Sam, it must go.
What about that Gollum creature, for instance?
The Gollum isn't dead, and he's still after that ring!
I'd hate to think of you with naught but a bit of leather...
...between you and a stab in the dark.
This hellish Mordor.
First it sears you, then it freezes you.
Mr. Frodo...
...maybe we could rest just a little.
My eyes are fair closing by themselves.
Not here.
I didn't want to say anything...
...but there's a black rider, a Nazgul, over us.
I can feel it. We must keep moving.
Only a little more to climb out of the canyon.
Then we'll take a look...
...and see what the Vale of Gorgoroth holds for us.
I told you, you'd see it, Mr. Frodo.
Just look at it.
God help us.
Behold Gorgoroth!
I don't like the looks of things at all.
Pretty hopeless, I call it.
Yes. And these dark armies are not only of Orcs.
There are Men, too!
We just can't cross all that open country crawling with enemies.
Still, Sam, we shall have to try.
It's no worse than I expected.
I never hoped to get across...
...but I've got to do the best I can.
I think we can make it to the next boulder, master.
No one is about.
Blasted moonlight.
Traveling by night's almost as bad as by day.
Come now, sir. I'll help.
Got to rest.
If you please, sir. Me too.
Just for a few minutes.

Mr. Frodo.
- What is it?
- Now we've gone and done it.
Slept through till daylight.
With only this fool rock between us and them armies.
Look out.
What have we here? Two deserters?
Up with you! Get in line!
We're in luck.
- He thinks we're Orcs.
- Luck?
Good sir, we're gonna be marching with the whole blinking army...
...back to Cirith Ungol where we started from!
Come on, you slugs!
"Where's there's a whip
"We don't wanna go to war today
"But the Lord of the Lash says,
'Nay, nay, nay'
"We're gonna march all day
"Where there's a whip, there's a way"
I can't continue.
I'd rather be singing a good old Hobbit song myself.
At least they gave us provisions for our packs.
But Orc food is enough to turn a rodent sick.
Samwise, we have got to break ranks.
Not while old whipper there is watching.
Don't worry, master.
The opportunity will come.
Halt.
What do you mean, "halt"?
I have a battalion of Men to move across your road.
Well I've got a battalion of Orcs to move across yours.
You wait!
Men come before Orcs. Get back.
I think this is it! You stay right here, sir.
You going to stand for that, sir?
Get back in line!
You mean you're going to let a pack of filthy Man-creatures go before us?
And you call yourself an Orc?
You're right.
Kill them, bone them, cut them to bits!
Smash them, bash them!
Skin them alive!
Not an inch.
Not an inch further can I move.
Come, Mr. Frodo.
One more crawl and then you can lie still.
A bit further.
This way, sir.
No use. Going to die. Can't see a thing.
Mr. Frodo.
Don't die, Mr. Frodo.
You can't die. Please, master.
If any power of good can hear us in this accursed land...
...give us help.
Help us.
Power of good?
Indeed, was there none left in all Middle-earth...
...with strength to aid our dying cause?
At that moment, the forces of darkness made ready to break the main gate...
...with a mighty battering ram which they had named Grond.
Long had it been forging in the dark smithies of Mordor...
...and on it spells of ruin lay.
- The gate will never stand up to that thing!
- Like the arm of the devil himself!
When the gates break
I shall be there to greet it!
Have my steed, Shadowfax, made ready!
- Farewell, Pippin.
- I go with you, sir.
Then we leave this life together.
Come, little one.
On, Shadowfax!
The Lord of the Nazgul...
...Sauron's second-in-command.
A creature of the super-natural...
...and so no living Man could hinder him...
...nor bring him harm in any way.
He was invulnerable!
You cannot enter here!
Go back to the abyss prepared for you!
Go back! Fall to the nothingness that awaits you and your master. Go!
Old fool!
This is my hour.
Do you not know Death when you see it?
Die now and curse in vain!
And, as from some courtyard of the city, a cock crowed...
...recking nothing of wizardry or war...
...welcoming only the morning...
...that in the sky far above the shadows of death...
...was coming with the dawn.
For as if in answer there came from far away, another note.
Horns! Horns! Horns!
Over the fields of Pelennor, they echoed from the distance.
Great horns in the north, wildly blowing.
Theoden and the rescuing arms of Rohan had come at last.
Ride now.
Ride now, to Gondor.
Victory was slipping from the grasp of evil...
...even as he stretched out his hand to seize it.
And the strength of goodness began to be felt once more...
...throughout the lands.
Had a prayer been answered?
Water. Give me water.
Master! Thank heaven!
Here, not too much now.
Not all at once.
He's weakening.
I feel it. Sauron is weakening.
But he is still in command.
His arm is long, and it wields great power.
No, master. You must rest.
I must still destroy the Ring.
I've more of a chance now...
...but there's still such a long way to go.
That's tomorrow, Mr. Frodo, tomorrow.
And as the battle raged anew on the fields of Pelennor...
...the carnage continuing endlessly through the days and nights...
...the real victory still lay in the hands of Frodo and Samwise...
...and the terrible weight they bore closer and closer...
...to the destruction, which was our only hope.
And finally, almost dead...
...without fully realizing they had reached the roots...
...of the accursed Mount Doom.
Come, Sam. Dear Sam.
For the rest of the way we shall crawl.
And so foot by foot...
...like small gray insects...
...they crept up the slope...
...ever closer to that which lay inside the mountain...
...the fire, and the Cracks of Doom.
"Doom
"The Cracks of Doom
"The chambers of fire
"The fires of doom"
Who causes the minutes to fall dead...
...adding up to no passing hour...
...bringing no change from day to night...
...as the unseen sun fails to filter into the ever-present shadows?
Who is this dark lord who turns starless nights into sunless days?
How does his piercing eye see through the ever-present darkness?
Seeing all and nothing.
The Restless Eye, in his dark tower...
...wearing a veil of protective shadow he has woven from fear.
And yet he fears, too.
In the security of his protective realm...
...he fears the winds of the world are turning against him.
Tearing aside his veils and troubling him...
...with tidings of bold spies that have passed through his fences.
"Doom
"The Cracks of Doom
"The chambers of fire
"The fires of doom"
- Did you see when the clouds parted?
- Yes.
He's spotted us!
It's all up, or will soon be.
This is the end of ends!
Still have a chance.
Bless you, sir, for your bravery!
Give me the strength.
I ask you:
Give me the strength to try once more.
Wicked master.
- God help us.
- Gollum.
Wicked master cheats us.
He mustn't go that way!
He mustn't hurt Precious.
Away, you scum.
What do you want of us?
Give it to Gollum, yes, give it to us!
Give it to us!
My Precious, my ring.
Soon it will be mine...
...all mine!
Precious, my Precious.
Precious.
Precious is mine.
You foul, reeking scum!
I'll kill you!
I can't strike! I may hit Mr. Frodo.
Let me get hold of the Ring.
"The bearer of the Ring
"The wearer of the Ring
"Stands on the very brink of fate
"Staring into eyes of darkness and despair
"That rise and shrink with hate"
Be gone and trouble me no more!
If you touch me ever again...
...you shall be cast, yourself, into the Fire of Doom.
Look out! He'll spring again.
Quick, master, no time to lose.
Go on! I'll deal with him!
Now I can deal with you!
Don't kill us. Don't hurt us.
Let us live, please.
Let us live, just a little longer.
Live.
Lost.
We're lost!
And when Precious goes...
...we'll die, yes.
All of us die into the dust.
How can I kill such a pitiful and cringing abomination?
I have come to know the strain of bearing the Ring for even a little while.
But this miserable creature enslaved to it for years...
Curse you, you stinking thing!
Be off! I don't trust you, not as far as I could kick you.
But be off or I shall hurt you with nasty cruel steel. Yes!
Now to find Mr. Frodo again.
And here it is. Sammath Naur!
Doorway to the gut of the mountain, and to hell itself, for all I know.
Dark, hot, reeking.
Frodo! Master!
There's no choice.
I have to go in.
And at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields the tide had turned...
...with the arrival of Theoden and the armies of Rohan.
- Hail proud Merry!
- Hail Pippin.
Bless you for a sure eye, old friend.
How good to see you!
Bless you for bringing Theoden and his army.
You've won the day for us!
In the midst of Theoden's glory, his golden shield was dimmed.
The new morning was blotted from the sky. And the dark fell upon him.
Fear no darkness, Snowmane.
No, Snowmane!
And the Dark Force had claimed our savior, Lord of Rohan.
Lord Theoden! Nay.
Oh, my dear master. Oh, the horror.
No, my friend. He is gone!
You can do nothing.
Hear me, O Darkness!
I will avenge my lord!
And what event...
...at just that moment caused evil to enlist such power?
Nothing here, surely.
But in the bowels of Mount Doom...
Master! Mr. Frodo.
Master, where are you?
Behold! The Crack of Doom!
- Master.
- Hold. Get back!
Master, it is me, Samwise!
And if that be the Crack of Doom...
...at last do what you've come all this distance to do!
Now!
I have come. But I do not choose to do now what I have come to do!
"The bearer of the Ring
The wearer of the Ring
"He hears a voice compelling him
"Filling him with thoughts that echo in his mind
"It should be telling him"
No, Mr. Frodo.
Don't let the Ring claim you!
"Beware the power is a power never known
"Beware the power that was simple now has grown
"Beware, oh wearer of the Ring
"The final power has yet to be shown"
Get back! I am not the Ring's!
The Ring is mine. Look!
Master!
No!
Please!
He had come again, bringing ruin...
...turning hope to despair, and victory to death.
Be gone, foul Dwimmerlaik,
Lord of Carrion.
Leave the dead in peace!
Come not between the Nazgul and his prey!
Or he will slay thee in turn.
Do what you will. I will hinder it, if I may!
Hinder me? Thou fool.
Dost thou not know the prophecy?
"No living man may hinder me."
But no living man am I!
You look upon a woman. Eowyn am I.
You stand between me and my lord and kin.
Be gone for living or dark undead
I will smite you if you touch him!
A woman? Eowyn?
'Tis Lord Theoden's niece!
She wanted to ride with us, but he forbade.
She disguised as a knight and she came hither!
A foul, putrid wind!
How does she bear the stench of it?
Strong she is, and brave.
I must to her aid!
No!
It's empty!
Uncle, I have avenged thee!
Theoden was borne from the field with honor.
And we wondered if, when our own lord,
King Aragorn, returned...
...would his fate be the same?
With the death of the Nazgul lord,
Sauron's forces lost heart...
...and began a retreat of abysmal disarray.
And then, as if our triumph were but a child's toy...
...a game with which Sauron was playing and taunting us...
...the tide of battle suddenly changed.
For from the wretched forces of evil, a new cry of hope went up.
The Black Fleet!
That which I dreaded had happened.
For if enemy-laden ships had come from this direction...
...it meant that the black forces had already conquered Ethir and Lebennin...
...lands we had thought safely ours.
The tide had turned still one more time...
...and this time, against us!
But behold!
As the flagship's standard broke the wind...
...it displayed the sign no lord had borne for years...
...and which only one lord could bear:
Aragon! He who would be our king...
...had returned!
And the hosts of Mordor were seized with bewilderment...
...and they fled.
That night we held council.
While Aragorn had the enemy on the run...
...he decided to pursue them into Mordor...
...across the Gorgoroth Plateau...
...and to the bastion of Sauron himself, the Dark Tower of Barad-dur.
The shortest way would be through the pass at Cirith Ungol.
But that is narrow and dangerous to move an army through.
And so he decided to march along the mountains, north...
...and then west...
...to the haunted pass of Cirith Gorgor...
...and the untold legions of the Black Lord.
Why so glum, Wizard?
Does the mere thought of Sauron's vast forces overwhelm your spirit?
This war is without final hope.
Victory cannot be achieved by force of arms...
...whether you sit here to endure siege after siege...
...or march out to be overwhelmed.
You have only a choice of evils!
Then, if the choice be mine...
...I choose to march!
And for days and nights march we did.
But my spirit was leaden.
"Win the battle, lose the war
"Choice of evils lie before your feet
"Retreat, retreat, retreat"
And finally, the pass.
Guarded by The Towers of the Teeth.
And inside, the Orcs made song to match my spirit.
"If you win then you will lose
"Choice of evils yours to choose
"Retreat, retreat, retreat
"You are standing in the eye of the storm
"Move an inch and you'll be dead
"You are standing underneath
"The Towers of the Teeth and the Eye blazes red
"Win the battle lose the war
"Choice of evils lie before your feet
"Retreat, retreat, retreat"
Silence!
Come forth!
The King of Gondor...
...demands the Black Lord to come forth...
...atone for his evils and depart them forever!
Come forth!
I am the mouth of Sauron!
His emissary, you mean.
For you be no wraith, but made from flesh and blood...
...beneath that mask and those robes, even as I!
Is there anyone in this rout with authority to treat with me?
Not thou, Aragorn.
It needs more to make a king than a rabble such as this.
We shall see!
Be warned.
You are hopelessly outnumbered here.
Our decision is made.
Be gone!
We did not come here to waste words in treating with the likes of you...
...one of Sauron's slaves.
Be gone!
We will meet your armies!
"You are standing in the eye of the storm
"Move an inch and you'll be dead
"You are standing underneath
The Towers of the Teeth
"And the Eye blazes red"
As I faced my own, almost certain death...
...I wondered, "Has he the Ring?
"Has Sauron really got the Ring?
"Where is the Ring?"
Had I but known that deep in the bowels of Mount Doom...
...Samwise had been searching these many days for his master...
...until he himself had reached the core, the fiery forge itself.
And this, at last, is it...
...the end of Frodo's quest.
But instead of his triumph, it ends with his madness.
What's that?
Gollum!
Here?
Fighting with something that is not there?
Mr. Frodo!
Invisible!
"Frodo of the nine fingers
"And the Ring of Doom
"Why does he have nine fingers"
Mr. Frodo!
"Where is the Ring of Doom?"
Precious! Precious!
My Precious!
My master! Your poor hand!
My master!
'Tis better this way!
'Tis better than that madness!
Look!
Mine!
Precious!
Gollum has completed our quest.
The Ring is destroyed in the fires where it was wrought!
At last...
...the Ring exists no more!
She's erupting!
Quick, master, back through these cracks, run.
All Mordor is being destroyed!
How?
How? There is but one answer.
The ring bearer has fulfilled his quest.
The realm of Sauron is ended!
And with him, us!
For the quake cannot tell good from evil.
Look! See ye!
The Lord of the Eagles and his legions!
Our armies are saved!
It's no use! The lava will have us!
I am glad you are with me here at the end of all things, Sam.
And you with me, master.
I don't want to give up yet.
It's not like me somehow, if you understand.
Maybe not, Sam.
But it's like things are in the world.
Hopes fail.
An end comes.
There is no escape.
Die well, Samwise!
Yes, once again...
...as he had so many times in the past...
...Gwaihir, the magnificent Lord of
The Eagles, had come to our rescue.
The mighty war birds returned us to Minas-Tirith...
...where months later...
...our dead buried, our wounded healed...
...the fields of Pelennor green with springtime...
...the city cleansed and rebuilt...
...the standard of King Aragorn was raised finally...
...to the top of the White Tower.
And down below, the restored Great Gate swung open...
...and King Aragorn officially took possession of his capital city.
Behold! The return of the King!
"The end of the Ring, the return of the King
"A new age has come to the land
"The end of the Ring, the return of the King
"He shall rule with a true healing hand
"The quest is done
"The battle won
"And all have lost in the winning
"Oft hope is born
"When all's forlorn
"And there's a new beginning
"He who had the courage not to fail
"The bearer of the Ring we hail
"Praise them
"Praise them
"Praise them with great praise
"Praise them with great praise
"The end of the Ring, the return of the King
"A new age has come to the land
"The end of the Ring, the return of the King
"He shall rule
"With a true
"Healing hand"
"Frodo of the nine fingers
"And the Ring of Doom"
And now we all know.
But alas, look.
Just resting my eyes.
Sweet Bilbo, you will return with us tomorrow to Hobbitown...
...where you may rest your eyes as much as you wish.
Return?
Nay.
On the morrow...
...I depart with Elrond and Gandalf.
Depart?
From the Gray Havens.
On the white ship.
What means this?
We are old, our job is done.
The Third Age of Middle-earth is over...
...and as we pass on to the lands beyond the sea...
...the new age of Man begins.
I shall miss you.
But I thought only Elves departed thus.
How can Bilbo join you?
Bilbo has served us well.
There is always room for a friend.
Have I served thee well?
Need you ask such a question?
I have grown weary of this world.
The weight of the Ring all of these years...
...has worn me far beyond my age.
I would, if it pleases you...
...set sail with you on the morrow.
Good friend, savior of all we hold precious...
...of course thou might join us.
Mr. Frodo.
We cannot be parted.
But, must I go, too?
Nay, dear Sam.
You are still young in spirit.
You and Merry and Pippin.
A good life awaits you back in the Shire.
With plump Hobbit wives...
...good Hobbit meals...
...Iong leisurely smokings of good Hobbit pipes.
And laps filled with bouncing Hobbit babies.
Now you must keep the book of the Hobbits up to date.
I will.
The Orcs and Trolls have gone to dust...
...the Elves are slowly departing.
Dwarves have disappeared into their misty mountains...
...and there have been no dragons for ages.
Right!
What troubles you, Sam?
Will there be no room for Hobbits in this new age of Man?
I think so. For of us all,
Hobbits are the closest to Man...
...the most human.
And one day they will be as Men are.
Look you.
Frodo is a bit larger than Bilbo, just as you are larger than Frodo.
And younger still than you, and larger are Merry and Pippin.
And, if you keep the book of the Hobbits as Frodo asked...
...ages from now, when your stories are still told...
...there will be those humans who might well wonder, "Is there Hobbit in me?"
Is there?
"Roads go ever, ever on
"To the lands beyond the sea
"On a white ship will I sail
"Watching shadows part for me
"Leaving havens gray with rain
"Now that years have slipped away
"Leaving friends with gentle pain
"As they start another day
"Roads I traveled I must leave
"For I've turned the final bend
"Weep not empty tears but grieve
"As the road comes to an end
"It's so easy not to try
"Let the world go drifting by
"If you never say hello
"You won't have to say goodbye"
And lo, as foretold...
...the epoch of The Return of the King ends at the beginning...
...of the new age of Man.
"If you never say hello
"You won't have to say goodbye"

Noble knights of the Round Table, ahem, ever since the accursed Black Knight captured our singing sword, evil times hath befallen us.
Ahem.
One of ye knights must recover the singing sword.

But... but... but the Black Knight is invincible.

[Bugs bunny] He got an
Oscar, and I got a carrot.
So without further ado, in three acts,
welcome to Friz Freleng's.
Looney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie,
starring... ha ha ha! Little old me.
Eh, what's up, doc?
You're despicable!
Sufferin' succotash!
Ooh! I thought I taw a Puddy Tat!
Th-th-the name's Porky Pig.
[Bugs bunny] Eh, when
Hollywood was just a kid,
the whole world fell in love.
With the wacky and wonderful slapstick comedy.
It was the time of baggy-pants comics.
And far-out gags.
Then Warner Brothers gave the world.
Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes.
Friz Freleng and his fellow innovators.
Created some of the zaniest, looniest characters.
To ever appear on the silver screen,
and the baggy-pants comics was out.
As Charlie Chaplin himself once said,
"how can we compete?
These guys don't have to stop to take a breath."
Then from the magic pen of Friz Freleng.
Came a warmhearted, humble, little introvert.
Called Yosemite Sam.
Any one of you Lily-livered, bowlegged varmints care to slap leather with me?
In case any of you get any ideas, you better know who you're dealing with.
I'm the hootingest, tootingest, shootingest bobtail wildcat in the west.
I'm the fastest gun north, south, east, and west of the Pecos.
Well, hello there.
$50 million!
Ooh. Hmm.
That widow ought to get married.
When I get my hands on that money,
I'll buy the old ladies home and kick the old ladies out.
I'll have the orphans' home torn down, and I'll get rid of the police department.
Ha ha ha!
Heh. That evil character's after that nice old lady's money.
Looks like this boy scout's going to do his good deed for today.
Ooh! Oh, it's chilly in here.
[Knock on door]
Coming.
Coming.
I want you, baby...
Your eyes, your lips.
Come with me to the Kasbah.
We'll make beautiful music together.
[Playing trumpet]
Oh!
Ha ha ha!
Come to papa, baby.
Nothing like this has happened to me since the boys got back from Gettysburg.
Oh! Oh! Ooh!
Oh! Oh, goodness!
[Knock on door]
Oh, goodness.
Someone's at the door.
Don't go away. I'll be right back.
Aha! I find you, my little pigeon.
Fly with me to Paris.
Ha ha ha!
Oh! Hoo hoo! My!
20 years nothing, and then it all piles up in one day.
Oh! Ha ha ha!
Oh, goodness me!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
[Widow] oh! Hoo hoo hoo!
Eh, what is up, Monsieur le Physicien?
You darn dude!
I'll give you a taste of leather!
Ha! You have insulted great lover.
The Marquis of Queensberry rules.
Take this.
Oh!
Pistols at 10 paces?
You're on.
En garde.
I'm ready.
[Honk]
Yep. It's right on time.
Ooh, what a night.
Open up!

[Crash]
Oh, heavens to Betsy!
He's looped!
You'd better sit down while I fix you a cup of black coffee.
I'll be back with your coffee in a jiffy.
Oh, that's too bad.
One or two lumps?
Make it two.
Two? O.K. 1, 2.
Ooh! Ha ha ha!
Oh, my!
Here's your coffee. One or two lumps?
Aah!
That's how many!
Oh, he flipped his lid.
[Door slams]
Great horny toads! Wait, Emmie!
Wait!
I'm sorry. Open up, Emmie.
Don't you come near me.
Aw, come on, Emmie.
[Gunshot]
[Whistle]
Emmie!
Ooh! You're cute. Let's elope.
O.K. you get to the window.
I'll get a ladder.
I want to take a few things along.
Catch.
That dame's taking everything but the kitchen sink.
Don't forget the money, Emmie.
[Barking]
[Devilish laughter]
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Well, hello there.
Where am I?
Oh, it's powerful hot in here.
Is this Dallas?
No...
But you're close.
And what is your name, little man?
It's Yosemite Sam.
Yosemite Sam. Now, let's see.
Yosemite Sam... yosemit... ah!
Here you are. Oh, my.
My goodness.
You have been a bad boy, haven't you?
The... the devil made me do it.
I mean, that rabbit made me do it.
Knock it off, Sam.
I can't stand to see a grown man cry.
I'll stop crying if you send me back.
Hmm...
I'll send you back on one condition...
You've got to bring somebody back to replace you.
Oh, I will! I will!
I've already got the very varmint in mind.
I'll send you back as a Roman captain of the guards.
I'll take it. I'll take it.
Then it's a deal?
Shake.
Ow! Ooh! Ow! Ow! Oh! Ow!
Ooh! Ow! Ow! That's hot!
Ha ha ha!
When you're hot, you're hot.
O.K., back you go.
By gum, he did it. I'm back in Rome.

Oh, woe is me.
Ah, shut up.

I'd better get out of here while the getting's good.

Where's your replacement?
You've got to give me another chance.
I'll get a replacement... honest.
See that you do.
I'll get the critter this time.
I'll send him to hell.
Oh, oh, oh, pardon my language.
Here you go.
What am I doing on this humpbacked mule?
Great horny toads!

Yup.

You've been eating onions.
And you're going to be eating lead!
I'm a-warnin' you, stranger!
It's fair to warn you
I swing a fair shooting iron myself.
You see that church bell?
I'll carom a shot off from it, then off that water tower, through the window, off the bottle on this bar, then part your hair right down the middle.
Ha! You missed.
Wait.
You call that shooting?
I'll show you some real shooting.
[Gunshots]
Now, beat that, varmint!
Gee, that's tough, but I'll try.
[Gunshots]
That does it!
I'm a-blastin' you!
I figured you'd like to settle this in a gentlemanlike manner.
Gentleman?
That's against my principles, but it's a deal.
10 paces, turn, and fire. All right?
All right.
[Gunshots]
Ooh... get back, varmint!

Ooh... cut it out!
No more gentleman stuff.

5:15? I'll take care of you later.
I got to catch a train...
And Rob it.
Get back there, rabbit!
I'm a-robbin' that train.
And I'm saving that train.
If you don't get back,
I'll blast you at the count of five.
You stupid horse.
Get a-goin'!
Now, this time
I'm only going to count to three.
You double-crossing rabbit!
You cut down your chances.
I'm only going to count two and then blast you.
Yaah!

And I'm not stopping mine.
Oh, yeah?
We'll see who will chicken out first.

Well, well, well!
Look who just dropped in.
You must like it down here.
No! No! I hate it!
Oh, I am terribly disappointed in you.
However, I'm giving you just one more chance.
Oh, no, you're not!
If you want him, you can get him yourself.
I'm staying!
Ha ha ha ha!
[Bugs] eh... The Roaring Twenties.
Brought on the cops and robbers movies.
Audiences flocked into theaters.
To see their favorites.
FBI agent Elliot Ness was brought in.
To clean up the crime.
He became a public hero.
Friz Freleng decided that whatever Ness could do,
I could do better.
From this point on, you are on your own.
You will be known to the department as Elegant Mess.
Then I made a Ness of myself.
Taxi!
Look, fellows.
How many times do I have to tell you?
I haven't got a cold!
Ha ha ha! This is fun, Rocky!
[Narrator] in the wee hours of the morning,
the mobster's car was seen driving.
Out on the pier at Lake Michigan.
They drove away,
figuring they had disposed of Mess permanently.
But they had not figured on his ingenuity.
The boys decided to throw a party.
Celebrating Rocky's birthday and Agent Mess' removal.
Among those attending were Jack "Legs" Rhinestone,
Baby Face Half-Nelson,
Pizza-Puss Lasagne,
Pistol-Nose Pringle,
and Teeth Malloy.
Uh... Rocky, we want to present to you a token of our esteem.
Hiya, suckers!
Who's the broad?
She's some looker, hey, Rocky?
Uh... what happened, Rocky?
You bonehead.
[Music playing]
You know, you're a lucky broad.
I like you.
Stop the music.
Stop... stop the music.
Stop the music!
[Rocky] turn on the light, Mugsy.
Turn it off... quick!
You lunkhead!
Now, you get over here, and I'll turn on the light.
Then let him have it.
Uh... O.K., Rocky.
[Running]
Gee, this is fun, Rocky...
Just like in the amusement park.
Shut up.
The way I work this thing, you'd think I knew something about it.
On August 19th,
Rocky was brought before Judge Hugo Strait.
In Superior Court Number Five,
State of Illinois.
Has the defendant been read his rights?
I read him his rights, Your Honor.
Didn't I, Clancy?
He surely did. Didn't he, O'Hara?
He did. I heard it. Didn't youse, Bugs?
I read him every right the rascal had coming.
Didn't I, Clancy?
That youse did. You certainly did.
Didn't he, O'Hara?
All right! All right, already.
Does the defendant have anything to say before I pronounce sentence?
[Lawyer] one moment, Your Honor!
I present writs of Habeas Corpus,
Corpus Delicti, and Ad Nauseam, charging that my client is deprived of his rights of Ipso Facto and E Pluribus Unum, and I insist on his immediate release under the precedent set by section 8, paragraph 95 of Rogers vs. Semper Fidelis.
Case dismissed.
Thank you.
Heh heh heh.
It wasn't long.
Before Rocky was up to his old tricks again.
[Alarm ringing]
All right, Mugsy. Step on the gas.
Come back, you dimwit!
Wait for me, stupid! Stop!
Agent Mess lost track of Rocky's new hideout.
Then an event took place that aroused his interest.
[Hen squawks]
Eh... j-jumping Juniper!
What's all the rumpus?
[Hens squawking]
J-j-jumping Juniper! A golden egg!
Eh... 24-karat solid gold!
I... I'm rich! I... I'm rich!
Who's responsible... who's responsible...
Who did this?
I know who it was. It was me!
But I'm no fool.
I know what happened to the goose that laid the golden egg.
Well, c-come on now.
Don't be bashful. Who did it?
I know who did it.
She did it.
[Hens squawk]
O.K. so I laid an egg!
[Rocky] "worth a fortune to owner."
Hey... that's better than the numbers racket.
Hey, boys, we're going into poultry business.
Agent Mess figured this was the sort of inducement.
That would lure Rocky out of hiding.
B-b-but... but I don't want to sell him.
Yeah, th-th-they talked me into it.
Say, what's going on around here?
What's the big idea?
All right, duck.
Make with the golden egg.
Egg, schmegg. I can't lay no egg!
I said lay an egg, duck.
Oh, well, you see,
I can't lay no egg just anywhere.
Um... I'm an artist.
I've got to have atmosphere...
Uh, beautiful surroundings.
Yeah?
O.K., boys. Make with the atmosphere.
Now, this is more like it.
Cut it.
All right, duck.
About that egg...
Oh, yeah! The egg! A little later on.
I'm not in the mood right now.
Nick.
O.K., boss.
[Explosion]
It was ghastly!
The deck seemed to lift up under my feet.
Then I was in the water...
Black, oily water!
I struggled...
O.K., duck.
No more stalling, see?
You've got just five minutes to lay that egg, or...
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!
Well, I'll see what I can do, but I got to have privacy!
I never lay eggs in p-p-public!
O.K., duck.
But remember...
Five minutes.
Four minutes.
[Bang]
[Knock on door]
Your laundry, sir.
Three minutes.
[Clock ticking]
T-t-t-t-two minutes.
[Clock ticking]
[Siren]
No egg?
[Gulp]
Uh-uh.
[Rocky] so long, pal.
[Stammering]
[Gunshot]
That just goes to show you...
You don't know what you can do till you've got a gun against your head.
Well, toodles. See you around.
Just a minute, duck.
Fill them up.
[Blows whistle]
[Panting]
[Policeman] we had you pegged all the time.
[Policeman] thought you could get away with it, eh?
Is there anything we can get for you?
Yes. Get me a p-p-proctologist right away.
The headlines proclaimed.
That a loophole in the law had freed Rocky again.
[Bugs] extra! Read all about it!
Tweety Bird missing! Bird gets the bird!
Read all about it!
Million-dollar bird gone!
[Narrator] Monsieur Sylvester is a special agent.
He'll search the underworld's back alleys.
For signs of the missing Tweety.
Oh! Ow! Ooh! Ow! Ooh!
[Newscaster] police authorities believe that Tweety Bird.
Is being held for ransom.
By the notorious Rocky and his gang.
And if you are listening to this broadcast, Rocky,
remember...
[Bugs] don't hurt the bird!
Turn it off, Nick.
O.K., Rocky. Anything you say.
Those bad old gangsters!
Nasty old kidnappers!
I wonder where someone would go about hiding a kidnapped bird.
[Bird chirping]
Say, that must be the missing kidnappee!
And where there's a kidnappee, the kidnappers must be close by.
Oh, goody! Goody!
Look at that nice puddy tat trying to save me.
Hey, boss!
I thought I taw a Puddy Tat.
You did. You did tee a Puddy Tat.
[Crash]
I slipped.
Oh! Oh, there you are, puddy.
Hide me! Hide me! Quick!
Here. Hide here.
They'll never find you in here.
Ooh... thank you.
Not so hard!
[Nick] hey, Rocky! The bird's gone.
[Rocky] he must be out here someplace.
O.K., pussycat.
Where is it? The bird.
Oh, yeah? Search the pussycat, Nick.
[Nick] O.K., boss.
[Sylvester] ooh! Aah! Hey!
Stop! No! Aah! No!
Ah! Aah! Eee!
O.K., bird. The jig is up.
Hey, boss! This is all I could find.
O.K., cat. Get your package and scram.
[Explosion]
You dirty guys!
Ugh.
[Siren]
[Policeman] O.K., Rocky.
Open up now. We got you.
Cheese it! The cops!
Take the bird. Quick!
[Banging on door]
[Door breaking]
All right, Rocky. Down to the station house with you.
[Man] hold it!
We are gathered here today to pay homage to this magnificent cat...
Who fought his natural instincts to save this little bird. Yes.
And now, gentlemen, you may take your pictures of the cat kissing the little bird.
Come on, cat. Kiss the little birdie.
Come on, Puddy Tat.
Kiss the little birdie.
Oh, he's a bad Puddy Tat.
[Narrator] on October 28th, Agent Mess.
Slapped the handcuffs on Rocky and Mugsy.
And brought them to justice.
[Door creaks]
They were sentenced to 20 years at hard labor,
which was a little tough on Agent Mess,
who was never able to find the keys to his handcuffs.
[Bugs] ah, this is
Hollywood, city of winners...
Winners of Oscars, Emmys, and Grammys.
Friz Freleng won five Academy awards.
And two Emmys.
Me? I got a carrot.
When I complained to Friz, he said,
"don't bother me. I'm creating."
He created the Oswald Awards just for us cartoon actors.
Tonight, you're going to witness this exciting event.
Hello, greetings, and hi.
Tonight I'm going to interview some of these cartoony celebrities...
That is, if I can find one.
Oh! Here's one now, even as I speak.
It's that little stinker, Pepe Le Pew, the greatest lover to ever appear on the silver screen.
And off the screen, too, n'est-ce pas?
Say something to your fans, Mr. Pepe Le...
Pew!
Gee.
Ha ha! Boy.
I must say, meeting you has been a breathtaking experience.
[Applause]
Well, look who's here.
It's Parker Pig.
The name's Porky Pig.
Who's your friend?
Thr... thr... two little pigs plus one.
Show-biz folks, huh?
No. They're build... build...
They're contractors.
I built my house of straw.
I built my house of sticks.
I built my house of bricks.
I must say, it looks like you're all living high on the hog.
Ha ha ha!
A little pig joke there. Ha ha!
Don't I know you?
Now, don't tell me. Let me see.
I'll get it.
Uh, it's Big Bad... Big Bad...
Wolf.
No, no, no. I don't believe it was wolf.
I haven't thought of it yet.
I'm The Big Bad Wolf, and I'm in the demolition business.
I huff, and I puff, and i blow their houses down.
Hmm. Sounds like a good business to be in.
No overhead.
Now there's some fancy feathers for you.
[Music playing]
Bawk! Bawk! Bawk! Bawk! Bawk!
Whoa, horse. Whoa!
Well, if it ain't that fist-throwin', bronco-bustin' Wild Bill Hickok.
I came here to win one of them Oswalds.
I'll tell you, Tex, you got a 50-50 chance.
Either you win or you lose.
Makes sense, don't it?
Well, just in case, I brought along a little winner's insurance.
[Applause]
Here comes that famous stool pigeon,
Henery Hawk.
It's Tweety Pie.
Howdy, Mr. Pie.
Ooh, I thought I taw a Puddy Tat.
"I thought I saw a Puddy Tat."
Isn't it time you saw something else?
Stupid bird.
[Tires squealing]
Well, here comes that Looney Tuney Duck.
It's me... Daffy Duck, in person!
Famous star of stage, screen, and television.
Please hold down your applause.
My ears can only stand so much.
[One person clapping, crickets chirping]
Just for that, no autographs.
Oh! Oh! Heartbeat! Heartbeat!
And now the moment we've all been waiting for...
Here's that lovable feller, a favorite around the world,
Mr. Show business himself,
Mr. Bugs Dummy.
[Applause]
What a scene stealer...
Stepping on my applause, trying to upstage me, as if that were humanly possible.
Eh, what's up, duck?
You're despicable!
I hate you.
[Applause]
Say the secret word and win an Oswald.
[Applause]
Eh, good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
We are gathered here to Award the Oswald to that actor who has given the world so much joy.
We know who that's going to be, don't we, Granny?
You tell me. I'm too modest.
We will select this outstanding star from one of the many qualified artists to receive this coveted Award.
Stop teasing the audience, you stupid rabbit!
Read my name!
The first nomination is The Big Bad Wolf.
[Applause]
I want to thank you, and my three supporting actors want to thank you.
Say thanks to the audience, piggies.
Thanks. Thanks. Thanks.
That's enough. Now sit down.
They nominate that wolf for acting?
Ha! He couldn't call his dog believably.
O.K., Charlie, roll it.

Tweety Pie and Sylvester.
[Applause]
Thanks a lot.
Tank you. Tank you for this great honor.
Here's a few scenes of Tweety and Sylvester at their best.
[Applause]
[Door creaks]
[Door closes]
I thought I taw a Puddy Tat.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
If I were you, I'd put him back.
It can only lead to self-destruction.
It only takes one bird to start you.
And before you know it, it's two birds, then three.
Suddenly, without realizing it, you're a victim.
Then one day, the end of the road.
[Gulp]
If you really want to beat this, look us up.
We can help you.
Our new member has come to us for help.
Would someone volunteer to tell what B.A. Has done for him?
I was a three-bird-a-day pussy cat until B.A. Helped me.
[Applause]
Being on a bird kick cost me five homes.
B.A. helped me solve my problem.
[Applause]
Fellow members, from now on, my motto is,
"birds is strictly for the birds."
[Applause]
[Humming tip-toe thru' the tulips]
Good morning, my little feathered friend.
I got it beat.
My will power is indomitab-ble.
Sylvester, you are weally a hypocrite.
Let's see what's cooking on TV.
After a-basting,
you'll find that your bird.
Will come out a-golden brown.
Every succulent morsel.
Will simply melt in your mouth.
[Panting]
See how easy the white meat slices, eh?
Doesn't that look...
What's the matter with me?
I... I got to get birds off my mind.
Maybe I'll take up a hobby.
[Stomach growling]
Badminton? No, it's got a birdie.
Ah, golf! There's birdies in golf.
Falconry?
No, no, that's out.
Baseball! That's it.
What about the Baltimore Orioles?
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Yeah, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
You bad old Puddy Tat.
I know. I'll play the radio.
Music will get my mind off of it.
That was Bye-Bye, Blackbird.
Now we'll play.
When the red, red Robin comes
Bob, Bob, bobbin' along.
[Turns off radio]
I got to stop myself!
There. Now I won't be able to get the bird.
Oh, Mr. Puddy Tat, don't you wike me anymore?
I... I think... I think...
I think you're...
I think you're... delicious!
I'm sorry I had to do that.
I was afraid you might be weakening.
[Muffled] yes. I did weaken.
Thanks a lot.
Aah!
Uh-oh. Here we go again.
[Panting]
One little bird. Just one. Just one!
No one will know the difference.
No one. Just one.
Then I'll quit. I'll quit after one.
Just one. Ha ha! One little bird.
One! One!
[Cough]
[Crying]
I... I can't stand it. I'm weak.
My compliments on a very fine performance, Sylvester.
Say, you're pretty good, too, Clarence.
I got to have a birdie!
[Crying]
I'm weak! I'm weak, but I don't care.
I can't help it.
After all, I am a pussy cat.
Oh, come now.
There's no need for this demonstration.
Birds and cats can live together with brotherly love.
Watch. Come here, little bird.
There, you see? I really love birds.
[Kiss]
[Maniacal laughter]
Stop it!
Let me go! I got to have it!
One little bird, just one!
Control yourself!
Like I said before, once a bad old Puddy Tat, always a bad old Puddy Tat.
[Applause]
I'll take possession of that little bird.
You can't be trusted.
And that makes two of you.
That's the story of my life...
In one cat and out the other.
Our next nominee is a star whose name is synonymous with show business...
It's about time!
Whose fame has spread all over the world.
Hold your applause until he announces my name.
Then you can cheer your heads off.
And the nominee is, eh...
Oh! Oh, goodness me. How about that?
The nominee is... hee hee hee!
Bugs Bunny!
What? Bugs Bunny?
It can't be. This whole thing must be fixed.
It's a big ripoff.
And here's a few scenes from my picture High Diving Hare.
[Applause]
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
Step right this way, friends, right this way.
Yes, sir, ladies and gentlemen, the greatest aggregation of talent ever to be presented on any vaudeville stage...
Butterfingers and Clumsy, the world's foremost jugglers,
Fearless Freep and his sensational high-diving act.
Fearless Freep? That's my boy!
Give me a ticket!
Give me a whole Mess of them.
I'm a-splurgin'.
Bring on Fearless Freep!
On with the show!
[Knock on door]
Telegram.
[Gunshots]
Come on, quit stalling!
[Gunshots]
Bring on Freep!
Quiet! Quiet, please.
Ladies and gentlemen, due to an unfortunate delay,
Fearless Freep will be unable to perform his high-diving act today.
What?
I paid my four bits to see the high-diving act, and I'm a-gonna see the high-diving act.
Well, you talked me into it.
No stalling. Now keep a-movin'.
All right, all right! Quit shoving!
Now, you varmint. Dive!
O.K., but you got to close your eyes while I put on my bathing suit.
Oh, all right, but make it snappy.
Ready!
[Whistling]
Splash!
[Gurgling]
By gar, the critter went and done it.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, for our next attraction...
I said I aim to see you dive, and I'm a-goin' to.
Well, here I go again.
One for the money, two for the show, three to make ready, and four to go.
Bon voyage.
Uh-oh. Forgot to fill the tank with water.
If you ask me, that rabbit is making a fool out of that...
I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.
Shut up, duck!
I'm shutting it.
[Zip]
Now, you dog-blasted, ornery, no-account, long-eared varmint...
Hey! Just a minute, you.
Them's fightin' words.
Yeah, them's fightin' words.
I dast you to step across this line.
I'm a-steppin'.
I hate you.
[Splash]
[Splash]
[Splash]
[Sawing]
Now, you smarty-pants, let's see you get out of this one.
Ha ha ha!
This time, you're a-divin'.
I know this defies the law of gravity, but, you see, I never studied law.
[Applause]
And now that moment we have all been waiting for.
The envelope, please.
Oh, my goodness. I just can't believe it.
Oh, this is too much.
Give me that.
I'm not too humble to read my own name.
The winner of this year's
Oswald Award is...
Bugs Bunny?
[Applause]
Stop the music! Hold your applause.
It's been fixed.
He gave himself the Award.
[Daffy] it's a phony!
I... I don't deserve this, really.
It's just too much. I'm...
You are despicable.
I challenge your so-called talents.
I can do anything better than you.
Yes, I can! Yes, I can! Yes, I can!
Let the audience decide.
I dare you.
O.K., Daffy, fair enough.
Try not to trip me with those big feet.
I'll try, Daffy.
We're on!
[Music playing]
[Tea For Two playing]
[Applause]
Boy, listen to that! They loved me!
[Applause stops]
[Applause]
I'm sick of people taking bows for my talent.
Now do your own dance. I challenge you.
Dance, if you're not a coward.
[Applause]
[Applause]
Har-De-har-har.
If they like that Mess, they're starving for some real hoofing.
I'll kill 'em.
Music, maestro, please.
E-flat, from the top.
[Jeepers Creepers playing]
[Panting]
[Crickets chirping, frogs croaking]
Ingrates!
Obviously, this audience has no class.
I've got a pigeon act that will bowl them over.
O.K., Daffy.
I'm giving you all the rope you need.
Now it's my turn to do an act.
Go ahead.
I'd love to see the audience boo you off the stage.
...after which I place a volunteer in this box and proceed to saw him in half.
What? Don't tell me you've got the gall to pull that old
"sawing in half" routine.
Yes, if I get a volunteer.
Volunteer? Hmm.
I'll be your volunteer.
This whole thing is a fake.
The way it's done is very simple.
Fake feet out one end, and I'm all scrunched up in this end.
The oldest trick in the book.
His turban is a fake, too.
It's a hotel towel.
[Applause]
Don't applaud him!
Look. I'm not cut in half.
Stop applauding!
It's a fake!
Sheesh. It's a good thing i got blue cross.
And after intermission,
I'll play the xylophone.
Xylophone? Hmm.
I can get rid of the rabbit, and it will look like an accident.
[Hammering]
When he strikes this note, instead of a xylophone, he'll be playing a harp.
Heh heh heh!
Now, with your kind indulgence,
I'll play those endearing young charms.
[Hitting wrong note]
That's wrong, you dumb bunny!
Try it again!
[Hitting wrong note]
Ooh! No, no!
You stupid rabbit!
Like this!
Look at the egomaniac out there making a fool of himself.
[Applause]
I hate you!
Now you've forced me to use the act
I've held back for a special occasion.
Just try and top this one.
I now present an act that no other performer has ever dared to execute.
In fairness, I must warn those with weak constitutions to leave the theater for this performance.
Lights. Thank you.
Some appropriate music, maestro.
[Drum roll]
Thank you.
First, some Nitroglycerin.
A goodly amount of gunpowder.
Some uranium 238.
Shake well.
Strike an ordinary match.
Girls, you'd better hold on to your boyfriends.
Swallow the match. So.
[Applause]
That's terrific, Daffy.
They loved it. They want more.
Here, Daffy.
You deserve this more than I do.
It just goes to show you...
You got to kill yourself to win an Oswald in this town.
[Applause]
[Crickets chirping]
[Applause]
Well, that's all, folks.
Hey, I'm s-supposed to s-s-s...
That's my line.
Well, then, say it.
D-d-d-d-d... that's...
Dirty guys!

This cannot be.
The worlds of magic and logic must exist side by side.
Not destroy each other.
Take care!
Be careful with your machines I say.
Who is making all that rumpus?
It's that balmy old gent what lives upstream.
Your motors must not crowd out all magic.
For the world is lost.
How sort of magician I hear?
I am Carolinus!
The Green Wizard.
Your loony you are. Get back to where you belong.
I belong everywhere, for my domain is the green world.
Nature itself and all its inhabitants!
Envatos... Umabella... Flamenca...
Away with your mill wheel.
A ball of blue magic to make it disappear.
Disappear say I!
Kala!
Magic he calls it.
My little boy could do better.
- Father you need rest.
- No time.
Just was not there.
I called upon magic and there was none.
Oh…
- The pain again?
- I can't let it bother me.
Have you written the messages as I asked?
Yes father, but...
Then summoned The Silver
Owls Of The Full Moon.
- But...
- Summoned them I say!
Is it true?
Did they stone you?
Well, me and young Gorbash will fix um'...
We'll burn down that mill and devour every living one of them.
That would do no good.
Just a little scared then... uh?
A short fiery blast to turn their hair white… uh?
Smrgol, please!
Father, the owls.
Smrgol, I'm summoning my brothers to a meeting.
Our first in four centuries.
Away.
Ommadon too?
The ancient laws command he be included.
Make Gorbash ready for the journey to the Temple Of All Antiquity.
I wish I could carry you, old friend.
No, you serve me well as the past.
Let young Gorbash bear your burdens now.
Father, who are these brothers?
You never spoken to me of them.
I know you are Green
Wizard Of Nature Realm.
But the others?
My brother Solarius, is the Blue Wizard.
Lord of the depths and the heights.
He's realm is outer space,
deepest ocean, highest mountain.
My brother calls council, but why?
Lunarian! Lunarian!
And my brother Lo Tae Zhao.
The Golden Wizard.
His realm is light and air.
He is lord of transcendence, healing, contemplation.
I was expecting this, it was inevitable.
Shen Zu, Shen Zu!
And finally, high in Loathly Tower.
My last brother,
Ommadon.
The Red Wizard.
Lord of the devils domain, seducer of darkness,
master of that heartless magic the world calls black.
Bryagh, Bryagh!
My fool brother has just realized the inevitable.
Well, I'll go.
It should prove amusing.
Bryagh I say!
Astride the terrible Bryagh, he is absolute ruler
of that infernal like mass of primordial filth which is his domain.
But why does Antiquity force you to include something so abominable?
As evil is a part of all things,
evil is a part of our world of magic.
For the irony of all existence is that good would be totally impotent without the contrast of evil.
Oh father, take care.
- Gorbash stands ready.
- Then I am on my way.
Ah? Whether does thou command me, Oh Master?
Gorbash, for pity's sake, no formality please.
Heh,... Well I ah,... Like to do things by the book.
To the Temple Of All Antiquity.
- Right. Where?
- I'll guide to as we go.
Away.
Dear brothers, we meet today in the Temple Of All Antiquity.
Come, come get on with it.
Why did you summon us?
As you must have noticed, our magic powers have been growing dim.
I have so noticed.
It is because man is choosing logic over magic.
- But why?
- Because logic is so,... Logical.
So what are you going to do?
Sit around like a bunch of old nanny's and let it happen?
Please, hear me out.
I propose we create the last realm of magic.
- Magnificent!
- Incredible!
The Magic Realm, where all enchanted things might retreat before their age ends.
If we consolidate our powers there will be enough magic left to create such a place.
Sealed off from the rest of the world by the Midst Of Invisibility.
You would defeat science and logic with,... a foolish retirement village?
Not defeat my brother, enhance.
The world though it does not realize it cannot do without magic.
For example, man hears of the dragons invulnerable skin
and lo, he makes armor, battleships, tanks.
A fairy flies and furiously jealous man
himself defies gravity with machines he will call airplanes.
A magician looks into this crystal
and sees and hears halfway across the world.
"Aha", says man, "if only it could be so."
And centuries from now
he conjures up miracles but calls them radio and television.
If man is to surmount the insurmountable there must always be magic to inspire him.
The world needs magic.
Magic cannot die.
It shall be.
I will bring you distant stars, wonders from the sea.
And I will bring you peace and harmony so that every magic thing might live together and share what enchantment remains.
No! Never!
I will not concede defeat by this modern world!
I will not retire to this "Fool's Paradise."
But we have no choice! The inevitability is the strongest magic of all.
I have weapons you would not dare use.
Fear rules men.
By summoning all the dark powers
I will infest the spirit of man so that he uses his science and logic to destroy himself.
What havoc and raze. Turn brother against brother.
Greed and averous shall prevail.
And those who not hear my words shall pay the price.
I'll teach man to use his machines.
I'll show him what distorted science can give birth to.
I'll teach him to fly like a fairy.
And I'll give the ultimate answer to all his science can ask.
And the world will be free for my magic again.
Stop! This must not be!
We want none of your dark magic.
While your powers die, mine will flourish.
Man will never inherent my domain.
For I am making man mine.
He will understand and come to desire my magic.
It is inevitable.
You shall see.
This dark determination
I swear.
By this red crown.
The source of all my dark power.
So be it!
Now and forever!
Farewell.
Can you not feel the world turning in my direction already?
Can his dark magic be stopped?
Only by invading his realm and capturing that cursed red crown from his head.
You may include me.
I will bring the fire of the meteors, the rage of the seven seas.
What was that all about?
Antiquity will not allow us to become involved.
The eternal laws of enchantment expressly forbid the four magic brothers from waring on one another.
Oh, quite right.
Terribly sorry.
- But what can we do?
- We must inspire a quest.
With its sacred mission, to steal the Red Crown Of Ommadon.
We will enlist the aid of allies who share our beliefs.
Mortals, enchanted folk, beast, dragons.
All such creatures in my dominion are peaceful.
Hardly suitable.
I can inspire Neptune himself to join and great whales and serpent of the sea.
Unfortunately, the quest will be waged on land.
No good brothers, it seems I and I alone can inspire such a mission.
Whom will you send?
Well first, my old friend
Sir Orin Neville-Smythe,
The Gallant Knight And True.
- And?
- My dragon, Gorbash.
He's young and impetuous but incredibly strong and brave.
And...? There must be three to begin a magic quest.
The laws so command.
There will be another.
A leader.
Who?
- I haven't the slightest idea.
- How Then?
Tonight, after you both have returned to your realms
I will turn to antiquity for the choice.
Its wisdom shall prevail.
Well, whoever Antiquity choose, Your leader will have his job cut out for him.
I leave him this,
The Shield of Saturn.
Forged from the mystic dust of her rings, it will deflect any dark magic spell.
I have only implements of peace, but perhaps he will find the
Flute of Healing Sleep useful.
It is from the
Temple Of The Muses.
When played, it will lull the most fearsome dragon to sleep.
Thank you, good brothers.
Ommadon will not prevail, and his crown shall be captured.
- So be it!
- May victory be ours.
Hay, a war at last.
Finally I'll will see battle.
Not a war.
A quest.
Well what ever you call it.
I'm ready for it.
Unfortunately so is Ommadon.
Hear me now Antiquity.
Hear me, oh great conglomeration of spirits gone before.
Make you will known.
Who shall lead the quest to capture The Crown Of Ommadon?
Search the future.
He will be the distant descended of Great Peter
The Dragon Master.
Ah, I have heard legends of Great Peter.
Centuries ago he tamed the dragons and taught them to speak.
Seven hundred and seventy seven generations
separate Great Peter from he whom you seek.
But why so many generations away from the original.
He is the first of the descendants who is a man of science.
Why should that be important?
TRUST THE JUDGMENT OF ANTIQUITY!
I do, I do. Implicitly.
Tell me in which century will I find this champion.
Ten hence from this. Our nine thousandths.
That would make it the 20th century by man's calendar.
The closing decades.
A silver acorn?
Drop it into the Limpid Pool of Time
and you will find him.
And now, farewell.
Are you certain this is
The Limpid Pool of Time?
My dear young fellow, I am one of the four magic brothers.
I should know a limpid pool of time when I see one.
Dragons and wizards and dungeons and princesses.
Dragons and wizards and princesses and dungeons and castles.
Mr. Dickenson, is this all you think about?
Never mind what I think, what do you think of this new
Flight Of Dragons game I invented?
It's fun.
What can I say.
Just a couple of thousand dollars we can manufacture this and we'll all be living like kings.
"Just a couple of thousand." he says.
Like it was peanuts.
This is an heirloom. It must be worth something?
Your heirs didn't loom so big.
If I give you fifty I'd be fired.
Flight Of Dragons, aren't you writing a book by the same name?
Was,
I don't have time to work on it now.
Not with holding down two jobs but, if this game sells...
You know something, Mr. Dickenson?
Nothing personal, but you're a real dragons nut.
They fascinate me.
Always have.
I'm sure they really existed at one time.
See, I'm trying to dope out how they breathed fire, how they flew, how they...
I take back the nut part.
Your a dragon fanatic.
Right, I eat, breathe, and sleep em'.
I hope to become a member of England's Dragon Society and I live here in Boston!
You turn, evil wizard.
Why am I always the bad guy?!?
Nine!
Aha! I got you blocked in
The Enchanted Ice Passage, frozen stiff.
Yeah, but an 11 we'll give me dragon fire to melt it...
That's going to be our leader?
That's the seven hundred and seventy seventh son of...
Antiquity must know.
Trust Antiquity.
How's he going to stand up to Ommadon?
Playing with toy dragons.
Look! Look closely at those small chessman he's playing with.
The piece the pawn broker is playing with is Ommadon.
And there's me,... and my brothers.
Dickenson piece is you!
And in the background, Princess Melisande!
Extraordinary!
Somehow, Dickenson knows what we look like.
Somehow...
Good old Antiquity.
I knew I could trust it.
Gorbash, fly to Silvenair and wait for me.
Tell Melisande to summon
Sir Orin Neville-Smythe.
But where are you going?
Intombley... Varioso...
Custon... Wizar... Kala!
Bring me to him. I insist!
Marvanzio... Kala!
What the heck happened? Hey, are you deaf or something?
A splendid game.
Come down and joint it.
What?
Untronto... Kala!
Twelve.
There's no beating that.
Come down I say.
Kala.
- What happened?
- I'll explain during the journey.
- Journey?
- Sit down.
Vidzumad... Kala.!
Keep your wits we're almost there.
That's what you said before!
Since those diced burned out it seems like we've been falling for hours.
Actually it's been more like ten centuries.
- Welcome home, Carolinus!
- Good old Smrgol!
A dragon!
I'm actually seeing a dragon!
A real dragon?
Call me Smrgol!
Son of a gun, a dragon!
I'm talking to a dragon!
I'll get you down.
A dragon, I'm riding a blooming dragon!
What you call me?
Ow!
- Turn your head!
- Pardon me, I'm sorry.
I've just been singed by dragging fire.
What a great way to travel.
Well, if you don't need me any longer,
I hear the call of my comrades.
A mating dance perhaps… Um?
Really, Smrgol. At your age.
You wanted dragons my son, dragons you shall have.
I'll never understand.
All those toy chessman I carved.
Those dragons and wizards.
How did I know what you look like?
Why question? Just trust Antiquity.
Am I dreaming all this?
Am I on that game board or in reality?
Perhaps somewhere in between.
Imagination is the most potent of all magic.
Look! Another of your creations come to life.
- Father! Father!
- The Princess Melisande.
My fairy princess.
Oh, I made her everything I ever desired in a woman.
Well, what I mean to say.
What you mean to say, is just what you said.
- Will I meet her?
- Yes.
Oh, but not dressed like that.
Department store Seersucker all charred by dragon exhaust.
Convento... Circulum… Kala.
I hope the fit is correct.
As I explained during the drop, my magic is quite limited these days.
Your Highness, may I present, ahh...
Sir Peter.
- Sir Peter, this is the Princess Melisande.
- Your highness.
Oh, you must be he whom my guardian has sought to save our world.
Ahh, I… suppose I am.
- Am I?
- Trust in Antiquity.
Did you summon
Sir Orin Neville-Smythe as I requested?
He'll be here by dawn tomorrow.
Carolinus!, Hello!
Wow! Another one.
Hey, look at what I've been saving.
Its gold, Gold, GOLD!
Oh! That pain again. I've asked him not to bellow so.
Simply magnificent sight.
But Sir Peter, it is only
Gorbash our house dragon.
House dragon?
Now you've met the entire family.
Gorbash, this is Sir Peter.
Oh yes, how-d'ye-do.
See a soup tureen.
A-A bowl to you, of solid gold.
Really Gorbash.
If you're hoard grows much larger, there will be no room for furniture in the house.
Blast, that's what I keep telling you.
I need a cave of my own.
Soon enough, when our quest is victorious.
Well ah... Sir Peter old buddy, your army's better be worth their salt.
We need power.
- My army's?
- Sir Peter has brought no army's.
What? No armies!
Aah,... Will you please.
What good is he? What good is he!
What good is he!
Calm down. Now just look at yourself.
Release some gas young fellow, at once.
Huh? Oh...
And turn your head.
Extraordinary!
The fiery breath has something to do with the dragons ability to fly.
- But what?
- I'm certain you’ll figure it out.
Help!
Help me!
- Uncle Smrgol!
- He's lost his fire! Help him Gorbash!
- What happened, old friend?
- My... My comrades...
My Cronies...
The entire... flight they all...
All turned against me.
The other dragons?
Why?
Because I-I wouldn't denounced you and... and join Ommadon.
The other dragons have gone over to Ommadon?
Aye. Aye he's cast a spell on them all.
A flight of dragons to protect his crown.
What a strange use for gold.
Because dragons tend to ignite ordinary bedding, they must find a soft metal to sleep on, and gold proves most comfortable for them.
Ah,... hence the dragons need for a hoard.
Ahem. Perhaps we'd better continue this conversation in my study, less chance of interruption there.
The Last Realm Of Magic,
My own personal dream.
Wow, what a movie show!
Sit down my son, I've got lots to explain.
So that is Peter Dickenson!
That is the pathetic fool Carolinus has enlisted to steal my crown.
Still, Antiquity must have had a reason.
Bryagh, fetch me the fool.
And so you were the one person from all the centuries whom Antiquity has chosen.
They say it is because
I am a man of science?
Well aren't you?
I was at first, honor student, scholarships, awards, grants, research,
but, how it all bored me.
Who could ponder equations when he had the chance to imagine dragons?
So I turned my back on it all
and started on my book
"The Flight of Dragons".
"The Flight of Dragons".
Yes, yes here it is.
"The Flight of Dragons" by Peter Dickenson.
Th...?!?
It's impossible. That's not even half finished.
Of course not. This is my library of unwritten books.
See? Beowulf, The Idols Of The King,
Gulliver's Travels, The Tempest,
Alice in Wonderland, The Wizard of Oz...
Incredible.
Nice to know you finish it some day. Aye.
Oop, no fare peaking at the end.
You are unique.
A man with one foot in the realm of magic and the other in the realm of science.
Sir Peter, I present you with
The Shield Of Saturn and The Flute Of Olympus.
Sir, I'm no warrior.
I'm awkward, clumsy.
Not anymore my son, for I believe you have found your time and place.
You are too modest, Sir Peter.
Let us toast the quest.
No, no, my dear. Cider makes evil magic in the stomach.
Oh, poor father...
You know, I had a professor with your condition but it had nothing to do with magic.
It was plain stomach ulcers.
Milk was the only thing that helped.
Milk? Really?
Alas, Gorbash has devoured every cow with in 20 miles.
Oh father, waist a little magic and change the cider.
- This toast is important.
- Ah, I suppose you're right.
Kala... Bovinamo!
To the quest!
Amazing!
Aww.
I tried all kinds of spells and incantations, but...
You see, Sir Peter?
Your science has helped already.
Do you find this enchanting, Sir Peter?
Beyond my wildest dreams.
If all this is just a game,
I wish to play it forever.
I beg you to take this.
A talisman.
Take it and may it protect you.
You are my champion, Sir Peter.
Bring me back The Red Crown.
Ohhh!
- I'll tell you I smell strange dragon.
- Look, terrible!
Bryagh's capturing your scientist for Ommadon.
And our quest is over before it starts!
- Father, Gorbash, do something!
- Wait here! Come on!
I'll overtake the swine!
The devil dragon is to swift.
A removal spell is called for to bring Peter back.
That takes too long.
Let me do it.
I call on all Antiquity to give me magic enough.
How does it begin?
Carvic crom zoominiy lava.
Yes,
Carvictom... zoomili... lavathol...
Ahh! Father he's dropping Sir Peter!
May our rocks crush your skull.
Untumble... varistone... misaclonis... madleumrot... Oh the biases! Kala!
What happened?
Where's Peter?
He's Gone!
He's Gone!
Gorbash, your releasing to much fire!
Breathe in! Breathe in!
Come nephew, you can pull through, keep breathing.
Yeah. Open your eyes.
Ah, h-he'll be coming around soon.
I didn’t have time.
The spell was incomplete.
- I'm certain we'll find Sir Peter.
- Where?
He could be at Loathly Tower, Boston, or on the moon for all I know.
Uhh.
He's awakening.
Right as reign.
By all that's magic, is the dragon not a wonderful creature?
Open your eyes boy. Come on.
Come all the way about.
It's me lad, your uncle.
Don’t you recognize me?
Uncle? What?
- Melisande!
- I am here, brother.
Brother?...
W-We kissed...
Kissed?
Oh!
What is it child?
Does he knows where Peter?...
He... He...
He is Sir Peter!
Well of course I'm Peter.
By The Beards Of Antiquity!
- I went and merged them!
- Merged?
Peter and Gorbash are one.
Peter is in Gorbash!
Well blast it man, undo it.
I can't undo till I find what
I did in the first place.
But... but where is Gorbash?
He's still inside here with me.
I feel him in the back of my mind, sleeping soundly right now.
Well, may he rest well till I figure how to separate you.
This can't be a game.
I-I-I never invented a rule to cover a situation like this.
Sir Orin Neville-Smythe, at your service!
I ridden all night.
Before the quest begins,
I hope theirs time for a good hot cup of tea.
Tea?
Milk.
My Dearest Brothers
Lo Tae Zhao and Solarius;
Today, at noon, began the quest to capture the Red Crown of Ommadon.
If the urgency of our mission is never questioned, yestereve's tragic comedy is proof enough of our waning magic powers.
For a spell went wrong, and Sir Peter of Beacon Street, was merged with my dragon, Gorbash.
Our quest now contains one knight, Sir Orin Neville-Smythe and one dragon with the mind and heart of twentieth century man.
The laws command that three begin.
Melisande being out of the question,
I enlisted the temporary aid of old Smrgol.
Aw, I know Smrgol is aging and none too strong, but I hope Carolinus will gather other allies.
He'll need them.
Meanwhile, the old dragon will be able to teach Peter the way of his species.
A dragon,... that doesn’t know how to be,... a dragon!
Come on out you mealy-mouthed little runts.
Is this necessary?
You want to fly don't ya?
To fly you need gems stones.
To get gem stones, you rob dwarf mines.
Come on out I say!
And bring gems!
- Hurry now, before we devour you!
- You wouldn't really?
Ah, dwarfs no.
They all sinewy and hairy.
Well the meat you get is not worth pickin' out of the teeth.
Now swallow them down.
Not all the way, let them find your craw.
Odd sensation.
Never had diamonds in your craw?
I never had a craw.
They help grind up the white fire rock when you eat it.
That’s limestone.
A puny man word if I ever heard it.
Eat!
You'd wear down your teeth grinding this stuff so you swallow it in chunks.
Wiggle them around with the gemstones till their pulverized.
It's like birds use grit to grind seeds.
Yeah, but don't talk with your mouth full.
What's all this to do with flying?
It makes the fire in your belly that gives you lift.
Hmm? Limestone is high in calcium.
Calcium when mixed with stomach acids would form hydrogen.
Hydrogen is lighter than air, thus giving the lift you talk about.
Something like a blimp.
What?
You got fire inside you when you go up.
That's all you need to know.
No, that's not logical. How could my ribs contain fire?
If I could only visualize.
Aw, for crying out loud.
Visualize.
I know.
Man this is great.
Now, as you explain,
I'll make a diagram.
Of all the.
Aw, well I'm doing it for Carolinus.
You see we got this great like, um, like a honeycomb of bone and muscle inside us.
- Something like this?
- Hey, hey that's it.
Compartments we can expand and contract.
And when we expand the hydrogen a-a, "Dragon Fire" as it were.
Expands and makes us lighter than air, and up we go.
Hey, how do I get down?
Blow it out.
Belch.
Yes, close the valves and expelled gas to come down.
Well, go ahead.
Turn your head ya' dummy!
Wo-wo-wo-whoa!
But I wonder why it comes out as fire?
Because we're dragons and dragons breathed fire.
Yes, but what makes the ignition?
The "Thor Thimble" fool.
Lluk' n' th' ruff' oof' yor' moufe'
Feel it, feel it with your tongue.
Yes, it feels like a thimble.
Ow! Ow!
Electricity!
The electricity ignites the hydrogen hence the fiery breath.
Dragon fire, dragon flight.
It all makes perfect sense.
Oh, what I wouldn't give for my typewriter.
Ah shut up and eat your limestone.
I must say Lancer, this is the lowest quest I've ever undertaken.
Still, I suppose it necessary that
Sir Peter to learn how to fly.
Nice chap what?
Soon it will be nightfall.
Ommadon hours.
Mmm?
I'd best summon them.
Og, hear that? Aww, he's calling us.
Shall we go back on foot or... do you think you can manage a short flight.
I can try.
Expand... feel the lift...
Now propel yourself this way.
Use your wings to steer to navigate, and to keep your balance.
Woo!
Look, I know you don't like comparisons, but this is exactly how a 747 does it.
I love it!
I say old chap, bad show.
- I'm ok, I'm ok,
- Argh, you blew all your fire.
You won't have any lift again until dawn.
Well you certainly don't want chance night flight.
We best make camp.
Right, I'm going to miss my bed of gold.
Care to join me, Sir Peter?
No, I suppose not.
All big dragoned as you are, must be most annoying.
Aww.
I have a longing to eat a cow.
I can't believe it, an entire cow.
Hoofs, tail, bones, ears... the whole thing.
Yes well, to each his own.
You know, I shouldn't really like you so much, with all that business with Melisande and all.
If it weren't for this, this dragon business, the laws of chivalry would force me to challenge you to a joust.
I hope we never come to that, Sir Orin.
I do love her with all my heart.
Her purity, grace, innocents, and title are an inspiration.
- Have you known her long?
- Since she was five.
Oddly enough, you brought us together.
- Me?
- Well, Gorbash did.
You see about a dozen years ago,
I was mucking about
in Ommadon's Red Devil Realm or whatever it's called.
Some... sort of quest, returning from a crusade, perhaps.
I suddenly spied a rather smashing sight.
A nest of dragons eggs.
Well, I was about to do a charcoal sketch,
when who showed up, but Bryagh.
He began to sup of the next generation, as it were.
Hold and get ye hither, or prepare to die!
Aah!
Rather,... rather good blow, if I do say so.
Must have been half an hour before I opened my eyes.
And when I did,...
I'd found he had decimated the entire litter, save one.
Well it seems a shame to die for an egg.
But I'd made the challenge.
Laws of chivalry and all that, you know.
Bit of this. Bit of that.
He had me. I had him.
Couldn't open his mouth you see, the gases built up inside.
And I, took a bit of a chance
And let him devour my metal gauntlet.
In less than a moment it touched "Thor's Thimble."
Bit of a internal explosion I fear.
Almost killed him. Wished it had.
He didn't like it at all.
Took him seven years to recuperate.
Quite a bit for dragon.
Hates me, needless to say.
Anyway, I'd saved the egg.
Cute little fellow, awkward and helpless.
Named him Gorbash in honor of the contest.
For it was rather gory and
I did get a bit bashed about.
Get it? Gory, bashed. Hence Gorbash.
Popped in on my old friend Carolinus.
Found he'd adopted an enchanting daughter.
Gave her the little dragon.
Old Smrgol said he'd be like an uncle, teach him the way of dragons.
I made a vow to fall in love with Melisande,
when she was old enough, of course.
Kept the vow, huh, dash it lot of good it did me.
And now she likes me.
I did write rules to this game you know.
No, I mean, I'm really quite sorry.
Not at all old chap. Feel lucky she's attracted to you.
Blast! It's fading.
- Is all my magic spent?
- Father, rest.
- But I thought I heard just as it faded.
- Heard want?
A chattering sound which could indicate something so terrible.
No, impossible.
Not in the forest. And yet,
I wouldn't put it past Ommadon to...
See! See! Blast you.
Gentle sweet brother...
My magic's not spent just confused.
I want the forest, not...
I am speaking to you through my magic,
which is none too strong.
Let me be quick. Melisande has powers to see over distance.
- True, but...
- Father, let me try.
Very well my dear.
Close your eyes.
Easy now.
You will see Gormli Forest.
Our friends, defenders of the Magic Realm...
Yes, yes. Smrgol is asleep.
Peter and Sir Orin are speaking.
Oh father, I do hear that sound, it's terrifying!
We best follow the old fellows example.
We'll be nearing the devils realm by the morrow.
And will need all the rest we can get.
Do you Hear? Strange. Like some insects.
Not?... Crickets no doubt.
- Seems to make my hold head tingle.
- Yes it… It is rather annoying.
It couldn't be! They only appear at the seashore.
What?
Impossible I tell you!
Why you yelling at me like that!
You stupid slobbering beast!
Don't you know Sand Murks?
Why you idiotic, tin coated, little goody two shoes.
Peter, it's the Brain Fryer!
Blot out the cursed sound!
Sand Murks, try to understand!
Hold Sir Peter, I beg you.
It's the Sand Murks.
Horrid little creatures who attacked by the millions.
Their chirping drives all living things insane.
Your brain will burn till you die!
Ow!
I did it to bring you to your senses.
Now listen, fly, fly away before it's too late!
Can't,... I can't, used up all my left in the crash before.
Look, I see them.
Clear your mind! Think, think anything a poem, a song, don't let them burn your mind!
Aah!

You look like you've seen a ghost.
Matter of fact, maybe you have.
Who's laughing? Huh?… Making such a confounding racquet.
I haven't slept a wink all night.
Missed my gold and…
Aragh, good old boy,
I -I thought you were dead.
- You know him?
- Know him? Of course I know…
It's Aragh, friend of the family.
Like a, a big brother to you.
What's the matter, Gorbash?
Did the Sand Murks steal your memory?
Sand Murks? Were there
Sand Murks? Here?
Nonsense.
They live by the sea.
Eh Smrgol, you could always sleep through anything.
The whole trick with Sand Murks is to get the big one, the queen.
The others are brainless without her.
Aragh, you're supposed to be dead.
Killed, dragged out to sea by a giant squid.
Quite right.
I woke up underwater.
Awaken, brave Aragh.
I am Solarius, lord of this realm,
and I can restore you.
Do I, do I live once more?
No, you are drowned, but
I have a task for you.
Accomplish it, and you will live again.
Yes.
Ommadon has enlisted the Sand
Murks to defeat Carolinus.
You must destroy them.
Give me life and I will.
After the task. For nothing living can withstand their terrible cries.
Destroy them and you will start to breathe once more.
Seemed like a fair bargain.
I did my part, and as soon as Queen Sand Murk was gone
I started to breathe.
So Solarius obviously did his.
Good old Gorbash.
What times we used to have.
Aragh, I've-I've got to explain.
Explain later, we have the
Sun and must press on.
Forward, to the realm of the red death, and the Red Crown of Ommadon!
Aroo.
- You have friends about?
- A female… Trouble.
She's protecting her cubs.
Wait!
If he's not careful, he'll have the whole family on his hands.
I can't say I mind the chance to rest though.
What the blazes?
Blazes? We've got to get loose.
It's Dragon Ruins.
Hold your breath, don't breathe.
Ugly, foul, smell.
Those golden (crimson) flowers.
Can't stay awake.
Not a wolf for miles.
Well, whoever is doing the shooting god bless him.
He certainly can handle a longbow.
I trust he's on our side.
There he is.
Good show old man. I bow to such expertise.
And doff his helmet to a better man that I.
And I doff my cap to you Sir Orin.
By all that’s holy!
I am Danielle of the woodlands, Sir Orin.
You know me?
My father sang of your exploits.
You have always been a hero of mine.
- Too good to be true.
- Hush!
You must forgive the wood elves.
They are petty outlaws, but good at their jobs.
And this is their leader,
Giles Of The Treetops.
For shame!
We saw the dragons.
We thought they were Ommadon raiders.
A thousands pardons Sir Orin.
Had we but known.
Ahh, think nothing of it little fellow.
The way things are nowadays, we all get a bit mucked up.
Get your men down from the trees and awaken the dragons.
Hurry now.
Whatever your quest is,
I should be honored to join.
Well, it's a bit unusual, but, speaking for myself,
I should be honored.
Nay, delighted to have you.
I assure you, my skills will prove most useful.
Daniel has joined them father, and Giles, The Elvin Outlaw.
Night is falling and they are but a day away,
from the Realm of Ommadon.
Looks like an inn.
Hellsway, last outpost of civilization before the realm of red death.
And beyond that wall, all is Ommadon's.
Seems to be a castle guarding the gate.
Ay, Gormli Keep.
The tollhouse on the way to Hades, with a giant ogre as tollkeeper.
The Ogre of Gormli keep,
I've heard tell of him.
A lumbering three-eyed giant as big as a house.
Press on, to Hellsway Inn.
Good bed and some hospitality will be welcome tonight.
Innkeeper.
Innkeeper I say.
At your service Sir Orin.
How are my friends doing, below?
I will look to them.
I do not usually allow dragons in my cellars.
But for you...
Who are those four somber spoilsports?
Merchants from Ommadon's realm.
You allow Ommadon swine!
Shh!
My inn is between two worlds.
I cannot take sides.
Well I don't like um!
I'll see to the dragons downstairs.
On to Ommadon.
- More wine?
- Wine not.
This isn't wine. It's mead.
But not bad.
Peter, how that a' Beacon
Street song go again?
♪ I came from Louisiana with a banjo on my knee. ♪
♪ Oh ho, Susanna, oh don't you cry for me, I've gone to Alabama with a banjo on my knee. ♪
Pluck-a, pluck-a, pluck-a, pluck-a, pluck-a,...
I am ruined!
Those dragons, they've devoured over 100 ham,
60 cheeses, and at least 30 barrels of my finest mead.
Tut Tut, you will be well paid.
Dragons have gold you know.
- They have it with them?
- You will be paid eventually.
My father told me,
"Never extended credit to a dragon."
Shh.
Too late for such caterwauling's.
Too late.
For the morrow brings…
Your rooms are ready.
Will you finally to bed?
- Ay, good innkeeper.
- For we may not see another night.
I'll, show you the way.
And lo, they sleep. An all to brief surcease, well earned.
And but for the watchful moon keeping her vigil o'er the slumbering countryside
all is still.
Aah!
- What is it child?
- Something looms.
Huge, terrifying. With two mad eyes, where three once were.
The ogre.
Ommadon has sent the Ogre Of Gormli Keep.
- Smrgol, look!
- Um? Ach'. What a terrible mess.
- Did we…?
- Don't-don't admit to anything.
Look! The Innkeeper.
Murdered. It's horrible.
I smell ogre.
Help! Over here!
Giles, are you all alright?
I'm near parboiled to a fare-thee-well.
But I sooner be cooked than crushed by that thing.
- Tell me what happened man?
- I hid in the soup when I first heard him.
He reached in the window and took Danielle and Sir Orin from where they lay.
- Then off he goes.
- Where to?
The dungeon at
Gormli Keep no doubt.
They're to hold them till Ommadon decides what foul deed to perform on um.
Oh no.
A fat lot of good I am at this quest.
Overcome by the Sand Murks and trapped by the elves net.
And then a stupor when the ogre attacks.
Now, now Peter, you've got a job to do.
And you'll do it.
What's that?
You must take the Ogre Of Gormli Keep.
Let me tell you something about how to fight ogres.
- You listening?
- Yes.
Good.
First thing to know this about the bones in an ogre.
They're thick, you see an ogres arms and legs are, are mainly bone. That's why biting is no use.
And their flesh don't burn.
So save your fire.
Aww, If this were my game and I face these odds,
I'd just fold up the board and put it on a shelf.
Ahh, Please continue.
Let's see, hopefully, throw him over a cliff,
If no cliff, go for the throat or stomach.
Never let him get a grip.
I-I'd take him myself but, age has gotten to me.
I know, sir.
- Huh? You mean I should?
- No sir!
Well, don't tell anybody what I just confess.
Ah, there it is.
Gormli keep.
Now you hold back and hide in the brush, we'll need the horse when we free um.
Ay, now, call him out.
Give him the challenge.
- Ahh, what's his name?
- Huh? It don't matter with an ogre.
Hey, you will suffice.
Hey you, come on out and fight!
Go to it lad. Go do it! Now!
Charge him, hit his chest, knock him over the wall.
Strength, give me strength!
No lad! Nooo.
What are you doing?
Aw, bad no.
You let it get a grip on ya!
Aw, blazes!
Hey, Hey You.
Let that schoolboy go.
Ahh, Ommadon coming.
You think he can help you?
- S-S-Smrgol?
- Yes.
Aw, that a,... a back side maneuver, I a...
Will that was, one I'd... uhh, failed to mention.
Easy, easy old friend.
I think...
I think something's,... burst inside me.
I think my heart's gone laddy.
But, but I-I did do him in… huh?
Yes! Yes you certainly did.
What I dreamt, … to have a way, to finish it glorious...
And so they move through Gormli Gate.
Old Smrgol. Oh, I shall miss you friend.
And lo, they enter...
The Realm Of The Red Death.
Easy Lancer, easy boy.
Just a stagnant stream.
We can ford it.
Wait, I know that smell.
Don't go near it!
Daniel, take one of your arrows and shoot it into the stream.
Waste an arrow?
Will need all we have.
I'd do as he says.
By my father. What is that slime?
Dark magic, that's what! Dark magic!
Maybe, but is also highly corrosive acid.
Much stronger than anything
I ever ran into at the lab.
It's got a sulfur base though that's what I smelled.
You do speak in riddles old man.
What's causing the horrible muck?
What is it?
A Worm Of Sligoth.
Never saw one that big.
If Lancer can get me in and out quickly enough,
I believe I can behead the scummy thing.
Wouldn't do any good,
Chop it up into 100 parts and each one would live to spread the slime.
- Do we make a run for it?
- Too chancy.
- Oh, of all the filthy.
- Steady lass.
Peter, fly the others away.
I'll remain and do what I can.
I'll not take flight.
Either I'll have worm for supper tonight or worm sups on wolf.
No, there's a better way.
Peter, are you intact?
Yeah, used up all my fire though.
No lift left.
Don’t know if anyone's though of this but, after that display,
Ommadon sure to know we're here.
These replicas of our visitors are exact, to the smallest detail.
Perhaps they can handle ogres and worms.
But see how they fair with the evil arts of Ommadon.
No, no! Most terrible!
What is it daughter?
What does your mind see?
A grasping hand, dark and fearsome.
To rob them of their will and courage.
To take their hearts and extinguish all hope.
A spell, an evil black magic spell.
Press on you say? What's the use?
- This cause is hopeless.
- Aye.
- We've killed a worm. What's that?
- Wait, what are you talking about?
I'm just a little man, but my foolishness is great.
I belong in the trees, the forest, not here!
My arrows, no matter how true what good are they here?
I don't believe my ears!
Fool! Trick back Carolinus to bring us here.
They are bewitched surly.
Listen, Peter of Beacon Street.
Listen to me, before it gets to you.
What?... Who?... A blue wizard?
Solarius!
Was the Shield of Saturn not given to you?
The shield?... Oh yes, Carolinus said...
It will protect you from Ommadon's spells.
Find the shield son, and drive this obscene force away.
Easy boy, easy!
Away! Away!
What's this?
How dare he?
How dare he?
Yes, Bryagh.
It's your turn now.
You and your legions.
Attack!
Demolish!
Devour!
Burn!
Grind them to dust!
Go forth and death be thy destination!
Doom. Doom.
A Flight of Dragons!
I COMMAND IT!
A FLIGHT...
OF DRAGONS!
Doom. Doom.
Doom. Doom.
- Look!
- Dragons!
Dozens of them. Hopeless.
It may be hopeless, but, I'll take a few of them before they get me.
- Let me take Bryagh.
- If I die, let me die a dragons killer.
No offense Gorbash, but I suddenly hunger for dragon.
Wait, we've got a chance.
Sir Orin, in your saddle pack, the tiny golden flute. Give it to Giles.
Now elf, pipe us a tune.
Quickly!
- And they are down, all the dragons.
- Destroyed?
- Asleep.
- But an enchanted sleep.
When they awaken, Ommadon spell over them will be broken.
They will join us!
The Red Crown of Ommadon may soon be ours.
Nay father, nay.
One still is awake.
Bryagh. Ommadon's power over him is stronger than Lo Tae Zhao's.
He has blood on his mind and can take them all.
Peter will fight him.
No, father. Peter being a dragon, now sleeps too.
Awaken old boy. We've won!
I've never seen such a sleep.
Puny scum of Carolinus!
Prepare to die!
No!
Oh my darling,...
Dead.
I'll crush you both, you filthy crawley!
Aah!
Giles, my darling Daniel, and Aragh too!
Blade, with whom I have lived.
Blade, with whom I now die.
Serve right at justice, one last time.
Seek one last heart of evil.
Still one last live of pain.
Cut well old friend, and then,... farewell.
Praying?
Now die.
I would have... lived a life with thee Lassy.
So now I die.
I am victorious.
Not quite yet.
Well, well, well.
The scientist!
And how did you shed dragon, filthy little man thing?
As Gorbash slept, I suddenly felt myself, Peter Dickenson.
And I thought, "Two things cannot occupy the same place at the same time."
And the moment I comprehended that...
Voilà.
I guess logic is stronger than magic.
Stronger than my magic?
Lo!
I... have gathered... the sum total... of the worlds evil... in one place.
And that place is me.
I am invincible!
No magic stronger!
I am the world and the world is Ommadon.
I can do anything.
Test me.
I can reach up and pluck down the Sun.
You can't do that.
Why, why you insect?
Why?
Seven heads and each one a simpleton.
Don't you know what you reach for isn't in that position anymore?
The Sun is the Sun!
- I can see where it is!
- Where it was pip-squeak!
Any school boy knows that light travels at 186,300 miles per second.
What you see is the Sun's position eight and a half minutes ago.
No magic but mine, can move the Sun.
I command it!
Not magic gas head, mathematics.
And that's the answer to why Antiquity chose me.
You are magic. Mere illusion.
I am science, logic, and the truth.
You don't frighting me.
Nothing so horrible could be real.
- I deny you!
- Deny me and you deny all magic.
Say it then!
I deny all magic!
Deny this...
Kimpacto... solauu... insomaa.
Eran... courant... palay.
Ocaun... eeoan.
Those incantations can't hurt me.
I have some incantations of my own.
How about,
A body in motion tends to stay in motion.
Protons have 1,832 times the mass of electrons.
All light is bent or refracted as it goes from one medium to another, in a direction perpendicular to the interface between the two mediums.
- AAH!
- Hallucinations may result from the selected actions of external conditions.
Upon the variations from their specific type which individual present,
Gravity varies as to the inverse square of the distance.
The velocity of light is equal to the wavelength times the frequency of vibration.
The geometrical properties of the space time continuum are determined by the masses present in space and time.
Come devils, witches, demons, ogres, trolls, sand rats, harpies, ghouls, sorcerers.
Come algebra, anatomy, astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology, geometry, mathematics, meteorology, neurology, oceanography, paleontology, physics, psychology, sociology, logistics, and so on. sociology, logistics, and so on.
AAAHH!
AAAHH!
Behold my darling, the magical realm.
And look.
It's Carolinus.
I am home.
We are home.
Well Gorbash, awake at last?
Aragh, I thought you were dead beneath the sea!
Old friend. Oh thank heaven you're still intact.
We've won, Sir Peter we've won!
I don't understand. Why the blazes do you call me by this man name?
- Gorbash?
- Of course Gorbash.
Why so shocked, Sir Orin?
You who practically hatched me.
Sir Peter, is gone.
Gone? Where?
As Carolinus hoped, he used his knowledge of science to deny magic.
But, by denying magic, he is lost to us forever.
- Father!
- Melisande! She's awake.
Father, Sir Peter was here.
- Yes, yes my darling.
- Look!
The Crown of Ommadon.
As foretold, it awaken you.
No, the kiss awakened me.
The kiss?
I was lost in that sleep of death.
Then I felt his lips upon mine.
I opened my eyes, and for an instant I saw his smile.
Then he was gone.
Awakened you with a kiss eh?
Well, perhaps he isn't completely lost to magic.
May, … May I join him father?
Of all questions, I feared that the most.
- May I?
- That must be your decision child.
Go, and you may never return to the Magic Realm.
For even now the great dome of invisibility grows over our world to protect its sanctity for all time.
And no one on the outside may enter its boundaries, save for the length of a dream or flash of an inspiration.
But it will stay through the years the centuries and the ages.
A part of man for all time.
And when ever man needs magic, we will be here.
Eleven!
You dragon fire melts my ice.
Oh, you win.
- Look, I gotta' get back to work.
- Wait a minute.
- I do have some business now.
- I told you that watch of yours...
Not the watch.
This.
Ye gods! Solid gold!
- Where did you find this?
- Oh, I had a hoard.
I don’t blame you for not telling.
You can live off this for years.
Travel, Europe, Asia, cruises.
No, I'll be satisfied with a cottage surround by trees near a stream.
Like one I used to know.
Oh, can I help you Miss?
Where do you kids get these things?
Melisande!

Bye.
Jonathan Brisby was killed today while helping with the Plan.
It is four years since our departure from NIMH
and our world is changing.
We cannot stay here much longer.
Jonathan was a dear friend.
I am lost in knowing how to help his widow.
She knows nothing of us, or the Plan.
Perhaps best that I do nothing at present.
I shall miss him.
Johnason.
Wherever you are.
Your thoughts must comfort her tonight.
She'll be waiting, and you will not return.
Farewell... my friend.
Mr. Ages?
Mr. Ages, is anybody home?
Go away!
Mr. Ages!
What is it?
Mr. Ages, may I please speak to you?
What?
I said, may I please speak... with you.
Oh, thank goodness
I'm so glad you're home.
Confounded machine!
You never know when it's going to up and blow!
Yes.
I don't suppose you would remember me..
Yes, you're Mrs. Brisby.
And I am sorry about your husband's death.
Now if you'll excuse me...
Mr. Ages!
Great Jupiter woman, what do you want?
Mr. Ages, I know you don't like visitors but this is an emergency!
Please!
Madam, that is an emergency.
Oh Mr. Ages, my son Timothy is so sick!
Timmy? The one with the spider bite?
Oh, just give him some pepsissiwa root and...
No!
No, he's sick with a fever!
Well... I suppose I could fix up something...
Oh thank you!
Follow me, but don't touch anything!
Understand?
I do appreciate it...
Just how high is his fever?
He's burning hot to the touch.
Yes.
He's soaking wet with perspiration...
Yes?
And there's a raspy sound when he breathes.
A raspy sound you say? Well..
Does he have a chill?
Yes, he does.
Have you wrapped him in a blanket?
Yes.
Now step inside, but keep your hands to yourself!
I'm right in the middle of... something very important.
I understand.
Oh, do you?
Look at this mess...
Oh, shoo, shoo, go on!
- Your son has pneumonia.
- Pneumonia?
It's not uncommon, but you can die from it.
Oh please dear God, no.
Your son must stay in bed.
Bundle him up.
Yes.
- Not to go outside...
- But how long must...
Three weeks.
He cannot be moved for at least three weeks.
But Moving Day is nearly here!
- You asked my advice, and I gave it to you!
- I'm sorry.
He must stay in bed.
Now, mix this... this powder in a broth and make him drink it.
It'll bring down the fever.
Oh, bless you sir!
And bless yourself, you'll need it.
Now, you must excuse me...
You know the way out.
Oh, of course.
Thank you once again...
Shoo shoo shoo. Go on now. Go on.
Thank you so... much. Goodbye.
Is everything all right here?
What the... Oh! Lady, don't sneak up on me like that!
I didn't mean to frighten you...
Oh, you didn't frighten me, I was just sort of... working out.
You just broke my concentration, that's...
You look more like you're all tangled up.
Er, yeah
I guess that's enough exercise for one day.
Besides, I'm really after this terrific string!
I'm working on a love nest for two.
You know what I mean?
Oh I see... you have a girl.
Well, not really, I mean...
I haven't found Miss Right yet.
But when I do the whole world will hear us singing...
Excuse me, pardon me.
Well, you keep making all that noise and Dragon will hear you.
If he hasn't already.
Wouldn't you sing too? I mean if you felt... heh heh... if you felt the call of the wild, but...
I would... I would not if I knew there was a cat nearby.
But..
But SHE'S out there... somewhere... and when I find her I'll feel it way down in my wishbone!
I... What cat?
Dragon! He belongs to Farmer Fitzgibbons.
Look towards the house. See if you can see him.
Come back down here!
He'll see you for sure up there!
Hey, there's a cat out there!
Quiet! Does he see you?
No.
Yes!
Stand perfectly still.
Everything's fine... he's headed right for us.
Don't panic! Fast or slow?
Medium. Make that fast. Very f...
I have to go now! Excuse me, I really...
Break!
Oh my goodness.
It's a rabbit!
Well of all the silly nincompoops!
You got yourself all worked up over a rabbit!
You should have seen yourself!
Will you keep quiet?
You were scared stiff!
A rabbit! I knew it all along!
Will you hush up?
Admit it! You were scared!
Oh... fiddlesticks. Hold still.
If I had actually been near a cat,
I'd be sneezing my brains out.
See, I'm allergic to ca...
I'm allergic to caaaaa...
I'm allergic to caaaaa...
I'm allerg... AHHH-CHOOOO!
Excuse me, pardon me.
The string, quick! Grab the string!
Hey, Miss Mouse, don't worry, I'm ok.
See? I'm alright.
That's not the reason I'm crying.
I lost Timmy's medicine.
Aw, don't cry. I hate to see a woman cry...
Hey! Was I great, or was I great? Did you see that cat out there?
All dripping, and... and wet... with water...
I'll... go back to Mr. Ages tommorow, and...
You weren't so bad yourself.
Hey, we make a pretty good team!
Oh, here, you dropped this back there.
Nobody messes with ol' Jeremy, boy.
Nobody!
That's it! Timmy's medicine!
Oh, thank you! Thank you so much!
Huh? It i... what? It is? I mean, it is.
Well, I saw it lying there, and I said uh...
My name is Jeremy.
I'm Mrs. Brisby.
Thanks again!
I have to go home now.
Uh, where's home?
In the garden patch, by the stone.
Do you like me?
Of course I like you!
Bye now.
No! I mean... I mean, um... I mean you don't think I'm clumsy or anything?
Oh... sorry. Excuse me, pardon me.
Oh. Well, if you're going to feather a nest you've got a lot to learn about how to treat a lady!
Right. When you're right, you're right.
And you're right.
None of the girls I meet want to get serious!
I doubt they'd survive.
Huh? Maybe it's my approach.
Say! You were a girl once!
You could teach me how to... you know, how to...
Behave yourself?
I'm not that bad!
I just need a few pointers to polish my style.
Jeremy, I have got to go home!
Well let me... Let me fly you home!
We can talk on the way!
Oh, no thank you. I'm afraid of heights.
OK, then we'll walk.
Bye now.
I think I got real potential
I mean, girls go for the athletic type, don't they?
Jeremy, you're stepping on my tail.
Excuse me, pardon me...
Maybe I should go look for Mom.
I don't think so, Martin.
Brisby! Briiiiiisby!
Oh! Auntie Shrew!
Oh Auntie!
Oh no...
She'll wake up Timothy!
She's not here.
Why is she always coming around here, poking her nose in where she's not wanted?
Martin!
Thank you child. I must speak with your mother.
Your Auntie is exhausted!
Why me?
That I alone should be responsible for the welfare of the entire field is monstrous!
Brisby!
Mother isn't here.
Auntie Shrew, Timmy's sick!
Cynthia dearest, don't pull me.
She's not here?
She left you children alone then?
I'm old enough.
Rats in the field up to heaven knows what sort of mischief...
Cynthia dear, don't fidgit!
You're so like your mother!
I ain't scared of nuthin!
She went to see Mr. Ages.
To Ages? That old flim-flam!
Whatever for?
Auntie Shrew, Timmy's sick!
Patience, my pet.
Why to Ages?
- Timmy's sick!
- Timothy is very ill.
Timmy ill? How dreadful!
I'm not afraid of the dark!
I'm not afraid of the farmer!
I can't hear!
I'm not even scared of Dragon.
I'm not even afraid of... of... of the Great Owl!
- Will you hush up?
- Aw, you hush up!
Martin!
Precocious monster!
Bossing bullfrog!
Spoiled brat!
Loudmouth!
That will be quite enough, thank you!
Cast not pearls before swine,
I always say... and that includes impudent piglets!
Good day!
Oh! You impertinent little...
Martin! Auntie Shrew, what's going on!?
Indeed!
Please... come back inside...
Not for a king's ransom!
I have just one thing to say.
That child is a brat!
Yes, I will speak to him.
I came here to inform you... that the frost is off the ground... and Moving Day is at hand.
Prepare to move your very very odd family.
Good day.
You never know what might be lurking about out here what with rats and...
Well, children. Now you've done it.
It was Martin.
The Shrew means well.
She only wants to help.
Gosh, I'm sorry, Mom.
Is Timmy gonna die?
No, sweetheart. He's just very sick.
What's the matter with him, Mother?
Mr. Ages called it... pneumonia.
Pneumonia?
When will he get better?
Soon... I hope.
Off to bed with you now.
Dear, a man came by today, from NIMH.
- NIMH?
- Yes, you know!
The National Institute of Mental Health.
He was asking if we had noticed... anything strange... about the rats on the farm.
Well, I said "No, nothing unusual".
Beth, I have to get up early.
Oh, it gave me goosebumps to hear him carry on that way!
Like the rats might have some horrible disease!
Night, Beth...
I told him you'd call him back.
What did I tell you? Moving!
- It can't be!
- It certainly can!
I don't suppose you've packed!
What about Timmy?
The chill in the air could kill him!
Well child, that tractor surely will.
For the last time, get your children out of here before it's too late!
Run! The plow is here, run!
It's Moving Day!
Run!
The plow is here!
Run!
Run! Get out!
Brisby!
Go get... Timothy!
Please! Take the children out of here!
Mommy, we can't leave Timmy!
Go with Auntie Shrew.
I've got to try to stop that thing!
Wait! You're out of your mind!
Brisby, come back!
Brisby! Hang on!
Hang on!
Brisby!
Come on! Come on!
Well of all the rotten luck... fuel line's cut.
He'll come back tomorrow...
I wish Jonathan were here.
Well, he's not.
Stop it!
What am I going to do?
We'll think of something.
Come on, let's get out of here.
The Great Owl would know what to do about this.
You must go see him.
Oh I... I couldn't do that.
Owls eat mice!
Well my child, show a little courage!
We're fighting for Timmy's life!
Jonathan, your wife, I fear
Is in desperate trouble.
A visit to the Great Owl may indeed be profitable.
Go to the Owl then, Mrs. Brisby.
Go there!
Nice evening huh?
I told you you'd love flying.
I don't know how
I let you talk me into this!
Aw, don't thank me, Mrs. Briz.
When we get to the Great Owl he'll know just what to do about everything!
Owls eat mice!
Ummmm... only after dark...
That must be the Owl's tree over there.
Hello?
Hello?
Anybody home?
Well, the place looks deserted.
I guess we'd better get outta here.
Step inside my house...
Come inside, or go away.
Timothy... remember Timothy.
Why have you come?
Please forgive me for disturbing you... but my son's life is in great danger.
The plow has come early this year and...
Move your family.
Yes... I would move, but Timothy has pneumonia.
He can't even get out of bed.
You must move it to a place where it will be safe from the plow.
Please... there must be another way.
There is no other way.
I must bid you good evening, Mrs...?
Mrs. Brisby.
Brisby? Mrs. Jonathan Brisby?
Why yes! He was my husband!
But... how do you know about him?
That is not important.
I will say this... his name is not unknown in these woods.
Please sir...
I'll do anything to save Timmy.
Anything.
There is a way.
Go to the rats.
But I don't know any rats!
In the rosebush.
Oh yes... near the farmhouse.
Go there.
Ask for Nicodemus.
Nicodemus?
But how can they help?
They must move your house to the lee of the stone.
No rat could move my house! It's...
They have ways!
I don't understand... but I will do as you say.
It is night. I must go.
Remember... the lee of the stone.
What... what did he say?
He said to go to the rats.
Rats. What rats?
The lee of the stone...
Mrs. Briz! Briz!
Oh, excuse me, pardon me.
Jeremy? What on earth?
I'm in disguise!
Jeremy, please, not now!
I'm trying to find the entrance, and these thorns are very dense.
Here, let me help you...
Will you be quiet?
They'll hear you!
I've got to find this Nicodemus before the farmer gets that tractor fixed!
I'll keep a lookout!
Will you...! You're going to get us both killed!
I don't see anybody coming.
If you really wanted to help me, you'd go away.
Why that's very brave of you, Mrs. Briz but I can't... I can't leave you here alone.
Why, if anything were to happen, think... think of the children!
That's it!
Huh? That's what?
Jeremy someone strong should be protecting my children.
In case that tractor starts up again.
Oh, in case the tra...
Hey! How 'bout me?
Oh, would you?
Yeah, sure! That'd be terrific practice!
Girls can't resist a guy who's good with kids, you know, domestic type.
Play games, help out, domestic!
Yes. Yes, domestic.
Now whatever you do don't tell them where I am.
My lips are sealed, Mrs. Briz.
Bye.
Good luck with the rats!
Where do you live?
By that big stone in the garden.
Just stay out of trouble?
Not to worry, Mrs. Briz.
I love kids and kids love me.
Kids love me and I love kids.
Dragon! You lazy kitty!
Go catch some of those rats out in the barn!
I've never seen a cat sleep so much.
Er... hello.
I'm... I'm Mrs. Brisby.
Umm... I was told to see Nicodemus.
Are you Nicodemus?
Please, I need help!
Who goes there?
Me!
Mrs... Brisby?
What are you doing here?
Oh! Oh thank goodness it's you!
How in thunder did you get in here?
The plow has come early to the field... you had better march straight back out the way you came!
I can't bring Timothy out.
The chill in the air will kill him!
That's another matter. That doesn't explain what you're doing here.
And that big rat chased me away.
But I must see Nicodemus!
The Owl told me to see Nicodemus!
Well, yes, perhaps you should...
The owl said?
Here now, what owl?
What are you talking about?
I went to see the Great Owl.
The Owl? You say you saw... the Owl?
Yes, and he said I should ask for Nicodemus.
Er, yes, I know Nicodemus.
He lives with the rats.
More specifically, he is the leader of the rats.
You know him?
No one has ever seen the Owl... and lived to tell about it!
Please... could you take me to see Nicodemus?
Well... ye-e-ess, yes.
But for your sake, I hope you're telling the truth!
Come on.
What about the large rat at the entrance?
I can't go back there. I can't.
Oh, that's just Brutus. Follow me.
Well? Come on!
Jonathan, your wife has come at last.
Perhaps now I can repay you for your kindness to me.
Yet Mrs. Brisby, who served the rats of NIMH far more than we her.
Jenner I fear may do her harm...
He is consumed by a lust for power.
Thus far, the amulet has remained safely hidden.
But if he finds it...
heaven help us.
Forgive me, I just noticed you're limping.
That's none of your affair.
Now, to what you are about to see and hear you must swear absolute secrecy.
- Yes, I unders...
- Swear it!
I promise.
If any of this ever got out we'd have humankind bulldozing their way down here to blow the place apart.
Is it always so dark?
We're down three feet.
It's the most beautiful sight I've ever seen!
Reveal thy name!
Justin, you featherhead!
Get your hands off me!
Ok, ok, just a joke!
I didn't mean any harm.
The meeting's already in progress.
What's this all about?
Who, may I ask?
Yes, yes, she can be trusted.
This is no stranger.
My dear, may I present Justin, the Captain of the Guard.
Justin, Mrs. Brisby.
Not... Mrs. Jonathan Brisby!
Yes, the same.
It is an honor and a privilege, milady.
If we could dispense with the formalities...?
How beautiful...
Ma'am?
Oh! Er... the lights!
They're quite lovely.
Yes, they are.
We've had electricity for four years now.
Five.
Jonathan often spoke of electricity.
But you see, our shame is that we're stealing it from Farmer Fitzgibbons.
Stealing?
All of that is going to change.
He means we're working on a Plan.
I mean, that we have a Plan.
And this stealing will stop.
Now...
Oh yes. Why did you send for me?
It's Jenner. He's at it again.
Hmmm. There blows an ill wind.
He's before the Council now.
This time he's attacking
Nicodemus openly.
And the Plan, no doubt.
Nothing will come of it. It'll pass.
Beware, boy, he's dangerous.
Jenner will be the undoing of the Rats of NIMH.
I'm sorry to come here at such a bad time.
I suppose...
No, sweet lady, you are welcome here.
We tend to take ourselves a bit too seriously.
The Plan is nothing but folly!
A doddering old fool's fantasy!
Nicodemus would have us destroy this colony only to lead us to starvation in some wilderness!
Ahem. Good ol' Jenner.
Wait. Listen.
Moving to Thorn Valley is a good plan!
Fie! We have everything we need right here!
You mean we steal everything we need.
Well come on, you suspicious old goat!
If we stay here, humans are bound to discover us.
They'd destroy us on the spot!
I agree!
He's right. We'll be killed.
Not if we got them first!
He means war!
We'd be outnumbered.
There are too many of them!
Hear me!
The Thorn Valley Plan is the aspiration of idiots and dreamers!
We...
We were just talking about you.
That's refreshing, Jenner.
Usually you're screaming about us.
Who is that?
You know the rules there are no visitors allowed here.
May I present Mrs. Jonathan Brisby.
Jonathan Brisby is dead!
She's not one of us.
What's the meaning of this?
Send her away.
Let's get back to business!
Wait, wait!
She has been to see the Great Owl!
He has told her that we could move the Brisby home to safety.
Her home was Jonathan's home.
We have urgent problems of our own.
Let the lower creatures fend for themselves!
Order, order!
Wait, my friend. I smell an opportunity.
What?
Manoeuvers of this nature are dangerous.
- Accidents could happen...
- Accidents?
Jenner?
- I'll explain later.
Mrs. Brisby! A thousand pardons, my dear!
Forgive the ill temper of my colleague.
It would be an honor to assist
Jonathan's widow in any way.
We are but your humble servants.
Th... thank-you.
I second the motion.
Hear hear!
Motion has been moved and seconded.
Those in favor make a show of hands.
He's up to something...
Take Mrs. Brisby to the library.
We'll approach Nicodemus when the meeting's over.
Motion carried.
Ok now, wait a minute this isn't what you think.
You don't understand what I'm doing here!
Think you can come snooping about looting and pilfering, just when everyone's away?
Well uh... Let me explain about...
Oh! What a lovely hat you're wearing!
Don't you sweettalk me!
I know you're in league with those awful rats!
Rats? Ummm... what rats?
Hoodlums, the lot of you!
Ummmm... why did you say rats?
You think the world owes you a living, right?
Right.
Wrong!
Wrong! Ohhhh..
Look, nice lady, you're making a mistake!
The sooner you delinquents learn that you must earn your own way...
Wait! Wait, can't we uh...
Can't we talk this over?
The sooner, the better.
You can't leave me like this!
There's a ca... ca...
There's a ca... He's a very big... and he might... and he might... mlfffp!
Good! Good riddance!
Teresa! Martin!
That's the least you deserve.
Auntie?
There you are!
Keep an eye on this hooligan.
Make sure he doesn't get away until I can fetch help.
And as for you, you black buzzard.
I wouldn't try anything!
I shall return!
Well, I guess we'd better untie him.
But Martin...
Hey, Mom helped a crow in the field the day before yesterday...
He's trying to talk!
He looks like a loony.
He even took her to see the... the Great Owl!
So?
This could be the same crow!
That's me all... Whew! I am the crow.
Untie me quick, I can't stand it!
What are you doing here?
Oh, it's a good question, but don't ask.
The legs... the legs... THE LEGS!
Aw, the poor turkey fell down.
I'm not a turkey! Your mother...
Where's our mother!
You big buzzard, where's our mother?
- What have you done with her?
- You'd better tell me or I'll tie you back up again!
The... the rosebush! To... to see the rats!
Did you take our mother to the rats?
Well I'm going to go look for her.
No, no, listen, hold it, waitaminute.
The rats, they're friendly!
Good! Tonight... Stay!
They're coming here to move your house where it's safe!
Understand?
Sta-a-ay...
The Owl said they're good and smart.
Get it?
You're right. He's a loony.
Oh no... no, don't...
You must...
No, don't do this!...
Now don't tire him out.
No.
Be brief.
Yes.
Say what you want... and leave.
I won't be a bother.
Justin bothers him enough with all his silly nonsense.
Here we are.
Thank you, Mr. Ages.
I don't know what Nicodemus sees in that boy...
I'll come back for you.
- Brief!
- Brief.
Come closer, my child.
Don't be frightened.
Sir... the Great Owl sent me to you.
Oh, did he?
He is a dear comrade...
Closer.
Ahhh, Mrs. Jonathan Brisby.
What an honor this is.
How... how is it that everyone knows Jonathan?
He was a great friend to the Rats of NIMH.
He himself came from NIMH.
Your majesty, my family is...
I know of your needs.
There is a book there. Read the words.
I can read, a little.
Jonathan taught me.
The children are better... than I am...
Read.
Jonathan... Brisby... made... possible... the rats escape... from the t... terrible cruelty of NIMH.
Jonathan?
He was ki..
Killed today... while drugging the farmer's cat, Dragon.
Oh, I... I never knew... just what happened.
Why did he never tell me about any of you?
Why?
To answer that, I must tell you about NIMH and our Plan.
Go!
Look there!
In the beginning, we were ordinary street rats.
Stealing our daily bread and living off the efforts of man's work.
We were captured, put in cages
and sent to a place called NIMH.
There were many animals there... in cages.
They were put through the most unspeakable tortures
to satisfy some scientific curiosity.
Often at night I would hear them crying out in anguish.
Twenty rats and eleven mice were given injections.
Our world began changing...
Then
one night.
I looked upon the words under the cage door...
and understood them.
We had become intelligent.
We could read.
The miracle was kept secret from the scientists.
And in the quiet of the night
we escaped through the ventilation system.
The mice were blown away
sucked down dark air-shafts to their deaths.
All except two...
Jonathan and Mr. Ages.
We were trapped by a locked door on the roof.
It was Jonathan who made possible the unlocking of the door.
I have a gift. Come.
Jonathan meant it for you.
It's so beautiful!
It sleeps.
Sleeps?
Yes.
When worn by one with a courageous heart the Stone glows red.
It becomes a blinding radiance.
Courage of the heart is very rare.
The Stone has a power when it's there.
Look! An inscription.
You can... unlock any door... if you only have the key.
Oh, thank you.
I will treasure it always.
Jonathan couldn't tell you about NIMH because the injections slowed the aging process.
You see, you would have grown old while he remained young.
Nicodemus.
The boats are ready and waiting.
We can leave any time.
Good.
My child, shall we journey to your home?
Sir?
Tonight we must move your house to the protected side of the stone.
The lee of the stone!
Yes.
I don't get it, Jenner.
With Nicodemus out of the way what's to stop us from taking over?
Jenner, you can't kill Nicodemus!
No taste for blood, eh?
They've taken the animal out of you.
What if we're discovered?
Ach, listen.
The Brisby house is a large cement block.
In the moving, what if it should fall?
- An accident?
- Of course!
Cut the lines, and the weight of it will crush his bones!
It's risky..
Once rid of Nicodemus, the Plan will die.
We can stay here as long as we like!
What... what about Justin?
Leave him to me...
Sometimes, when we have a large project that takes us into the open.
Mr. Ages makes up a sleeping powder to give to Dragon.
How do you get him to take it?
Someone must go into the farmhouse kitchen and put it in his dish.
The only way into the kitchen is through a tiny hole in the floor.
Ages tried it yesterday.
That's how he broke...
Broke his leg.
Right.
That was close.
- What's up there?
- The mill. It's falling apart.
Hope it stays up there at least until we've done with the Plan.
Plan... what is the Plan?
To live without stealing, of course.
It's wrong to take electricity from the farmer.
My child, we can no longer live as rats.
We know too much.
We're almost there.
Um... your Majesty
I should go prepare the children, for tonight.
We shall wait here until dark...
Um... About Dragon, maybe...
Oh nothing. Goodbye!
I volunteer! For Dragon.
Oh no, Mrs. Brisby!
Nicodemus, this is no job for her!
Please.
As you wish.
All right.
I'll meet you at the west side of the farmhouse at dusk.
Thank you.
Oh I must be crazy.
Goodbye!
I must be crazy...
Excuse me... pardon me.
Jeremy?
Shhh! I'm being followed.
Followed?
Shhh-hhh! There's a crazy lady with a hat!
She's got big teeth!
She tied me up! And then I... oh!
Ooooo! A sparkly!
What?
You're wearing a sparkly!
Can I hold? Oh, please, can I?
Jeremy, listen...
I need lots and lots of string.
Stuh... ring...
To move the block!
Move... the block...
Hey! I got string! I've been saving 'em!
You do?
Oh sure, red ones, blue ones
- green, yellow.
- Pay attention!
Go get all the string you can.
Ok.
But that'll take all day!
Good! Get going!
I just thought I'd mention in passing...
I've always wanted a sparkly of my very own.
- Will you get going?
- Sure!
Uh... Excuse me. Pardon me.
Bye!
It won't be long now.
She's washing the dishes.
Here's the powder.
- Nervous?
- Very.
Don't be.
You'll be ok.
I hope I haven't upset your plans.
Nonsense!
What makes you say that?
I thought I might have caused an argument.
Oh you mean Jenner.
No problem.
Justin?
I sincerly hope you make it to Thorn Valley.
We will.
Shh! Listen.
Mrs. Fitzgibbons is filling Dragon's bowl.
Get ready.
Oh my...
Better leave that cape.
Could get caught on something.
Here's the powder.
I don't think I can do this!
Yes you can!
Now take a deep breath.
Concentrate on the bowl.
Don't look at the door!
Steady...
Ok Dragon, I'm coming.
Steady...
There we go.
Now! Now!
Coming, coming!
Get back!
Mom! Don't let the cat in yet
I've caught a mouse!
A mouse?
Can I keep it? Can I?
No, Billy. Put it outside.
Damn!
Aw Mom, please?
I can keep it in Porgy's old cage.
Oh... all right.
Come on, Dragon.
I'll have to come back for you later.
Rats, rats?
They'll be here any minute... to move our house over there by the stone!
Wrong!
Actually move it!
Not while I'm keeping watch!
Auntie Shrew? I'm not afraid.
Afraid, child?
I have no fear of those great hulking beasts.
And should one of those hairy barbarians come through that door...
Oh! The rats!
I'm coming, I'm coming, hold your horses.
Hello?
Who?
NIMH.
Oh! Oh yeah, NIMH!
Yes, yes, I know, you called about the rats...
Well, I don't know nothing about any special behavior but the traps sure don't work...
In the morning?
Suits me fine...
Oh no, no, you can bulldoze that rosebush right outta there
I want those rats exterminated!
Uh, well, there's no... charge...?
Good. Ok, well, I'll see you tomorrow then...
Uh-huh... bye-bye.
NIMH... They're coming here?
I must warn Justin!
Teresa!
Martin!
Auntie's afraid!
Pull on the end-haul.
Careful. Careful!
Easy does it...
Nicodemus is cooperating beautifully...
Jenner... he's standing in just the right spot!
Jenner, I... I can't do it!
When that block reaches midway, you cut the line.
I...
Don't get any ideas, my friend.
You're in this up to your neck!
Come on mates!
Put your backs into it!
Ready with the knife...
Ready...
Cut now!
- I... I...
- Now! Cut it!
Don't!
Ok, help.
We've got to hurry!
That's it.
Come on, come on!
We're coming!
Ok, I see him!
Nicodemus... oh no!
No!
Friends... we cannot move the Brisby home.
But we... we just can't leave it here in the mud.
The equipment is a shambles.
Justin!
One day we shall journey to
Thorn Valley just as Nicodemus wanted... but not now.
Justin!
Mrs... Brisby?
Come. Let us return to the rosebush.
Where we belong.
Oh, Mr. Ages!
What happened?
The children!
They... they're fine.
Nicodemus is... dead.
Oh... oh, no.
You're in great danger.
NIMH is coming!
Come come, let's return to the rosebush...
NIMH is coming!
- NIMH?
- In the morning!
- NIMH!
- Yes.
You will all die unless you leave the farm tonight.
Lies!
Please! You must believe me!
What if it's true?
- We'll all be killed!
- Don't panic!
Don't listen! She's hysterical!
Get out now...
You get out! I've had enough!
Jenner!
Justin! Justin!
Jenner, stop this!
The Stone...
Jenner...
Get out of my way!
I want that Stone!
Jenner!
Justin, Justin!
My sword!
It was you...
You did it!
You killed Nicodemus.
That was no accident!
Yes. I killed him!
He wanted to destroy everything!
I've learned this much.
Take what you can, when you can!
Then you've learned nothing!
Friends... tonight we journey to Thorn Valley.
We will leave no tracks.
No evidence that the Rats of NIMH ever existed...
Come.
Hello, is anybody up there?
- Martin?
- Momma!
Mother, are we almost moved?
Soon now...
It's sinking... it's sinking...
Justin, the block! It's sinking!
What?
Come on!
Oh no, it's sinking!
There must be a... a cave in below!
Here, tie these lines together.
I'll get a line around the stone.
Now!
Brutus, quick, get some rope.
Tie off those blocklines.
Hurry it up, come on!
Move it!
Mother! Mother!
What's all that black stuff?
Come on, Teresa, get up on the table!
Cynthia...!
What about Timmy?
Get us out of here!
Mother!
Another line! Get some rope!
Justin!
Justin!
Hang on! Don't let go!
Grab onto my foot!
I can't breathe!
Oh no! Come on!
- It's sinking farther!
- We're losing it!
Courage of the heart is very rare... the Stone has a power when it's there.
The stone...
Momma, I'm tired of bed.
I want to get up!
Well, you're not getting up.
Miss Briz! Oh Briz!
Where are ya?
Over here!
Here it is!
I brought the whole mess!
There's plenty more where this came from too.
I got connections!
Hey! Your house is moved!
Oh no! What am I gonna do with all this string?
You'll think of something.
Ah, what's the use?
What's a guy like me going to do with a love nest anyway?
- Excuse me, pardon me.
- Excuse me, pardon me.
Look Mommy! Another turkey!
Stay right there.
Miss Briz! Miss Briz!
Lemme have the sparkly!
I gotta have the sparkly!
Miss B, I gotta have it!
Girls can't resist a sparkly, oh please! Pleease!
I gave it to Justin.
Justin? Who the heck is Justin?
The leader of the rats.
The leader of the rats!? How could you do this to me?
What'll I say? Mrs. B, what'll I do?
Well... just be, ummm... Be athletic!
Ah! That's right! Athletic!
I'll just be a little...
Mother, did the rats really go to Thorn Valley?
Yes, they did.
- Will we ever see them?
- Perhaps.
- Today?
- No... when you're older.
Brisby!
Oh! Auntie Shrew!
Oh Auntie!
Oh no!
Groups of unemployed workers, who have grown in number due to the tax reforms...
...enacted by the former Prime Minister, are rioting all across the country.
And with the confusion among members of parliament sparked by the comments of...
...Finance Minister Takanashi during a recent parliament inquiry, there seems to be no compromise insight between the government and opposition.
Hey. What'll it be?
Give me three peanuts.
Let's see here...
We've herded those Clown bastards onto Route 5.
Damn it, don't scare me like that!
Open the damn door quietly!
You wouldn't be so jumpy if you didn't have something to hide!
Try selling some normal drinks sometime, huh?
How about buying something for once?!
This ain't a hangout!
And drink that dog piss you sell?!
Twin ceramic rotor drives on each wheel...
And these are... Computer controlled anti-lock brakes...
200 horsepower at 12,000 rpm...
You wanna ride it, Tetsuo?
All right, let's go!
That bike's been customized just for me.
It's too wild. You couldn't handle it.
I don't see how you can ride something like that, man.
I could!
If you want one so bad, steal a big one for yourself.
Unbelievable.
School kids these days...
Wait! Hey, waiter!
They ran into the alley! After 'em!
This isn't a game, you idiot!
Shit...!
That's--
This is car 375.
We've got reports of biker gangs fighting near the intersection of Highway 14 south!
Request immediate assistance!
Car 375, en route to the scene!
It's the cops! What should we do?
Damn, and my motor coils were just getting warmed up...
Bastards...
Let's go, Tetsuo!
Right!
Damn!
A skirmish has broken out between student protesters...
...and riot police assigned a security.
There appear to be some casualties.
Furthermore--
What the--?
What the hell's going on?!
Move it, jerk!
I'm in a hurry!
What was that?!
Call the police!
Repeal the tax reforms!
This area is off-limits!
Go back! It's dangerous!
Something's strange here...
Let me through!
I'm sorry, let me through!
What's the big idea?
Look! Blood!
Who are they?
- Excuse me.
- Hey! Don't push!
- Excuse me.
- Hey! Watch it, jerk!
Pardon me. I'm sorry.
Ryu!
Hey! He ran away!
He's got a gun!
Fire!
Hold your fire!
There's a kid with him!
Run...
Hurry...
Go to Ryu...
Ryu will help you now...
Hurry... Get out of here...
Kei!
What are you doing? Hurry!
He vanished...!
He's to the west.
The west? He's in the old city, then.
Eat this!
Tetsuo!
Ryu! Ryu, where are you?
Kei!
No, that's--!
How you like that?!
Well? Who is it?
It's not him!
It's not Tetsuo!
Okay! Let's go!
You little...
What did you do...?
Tetsuo!
Hang on! Hey!
Huh? What did you say?
That kid...
He's hurt bad!
Hey! Wait!
We gotta get him to a hospital!
- He needs an ambulance!
- We can't move him!
W-What the hell?!
There's no escape.
We've come for you.
We can't survive on the outside.
Come on, let's go home.
It's the army!
Those are army helicopters!
Move out!
Down on your stomachs!
Spread your arms and legs!
Um... We're just, uh...
Down on your stomachs!
Spread your arms and legs!
Ow... Damn it, that hurts!
Kai!
- Hey!
- Sir?
- Who are they?
They seem to be an ordinary bike gang, sir.
We're going back.
Ow! Hey, wait a minute!
My arms don't bend that way, damn it!
Load the wounded onto the helicopter!
Tetsuo!
Wait! Where are you taking him?
Kaneda!
What the hell?
We didn't do anything!
He's heavy...!
So you and your friends went out at night on your bikes to visit your dying mother, and a group of hooligans called the
Clowns picked a fight with you.
They hurt your friend, so you lost your temper, which is why eight Clown members are now in the hospital.
That's your story?
She's cute!
Hey! You can't look at this!
And how's your mother doing?!
Huh? Oh.
Luckily, she made it through the worst of it last night.
And I suppose she's made it over the mountains on a bike by now?
It couldn't be these bozos.
You can tell that just by looking.
Wait on that bench. Understand?
How much longer are we gonna have to wait?
Okay! The next five, come get in here!
So the army's working with the police...
...to hunt down anti-government groups now, huh?
- Wanna put up a fight, huh?
- He's holding something!
Bastard!
Long live the freedom revolution!
He's got a grenade!
Crazy son of a bitch!
All right, that's enough!
Take him away!
We'll really teach him a lesson later.
You dumb bastard! If you wanna die, just hang yourself or something!
Hey! You people can go.
We've contacted your school.
What? You son of a--
Hey, hold on a minute, pops!
"pops"?!
There was one more of us.
- What?
- Pardon me.
What're you--
This is her.
Can she leave with us?
Who are you calling " Pops," you punk?
Ow!
Look here, kid! I'm only 25!
I'm not even married!
So watch your mouth!
She can go with you!
Call a doctor!
So I think the army was chasing that weird kid Kaneda saw...
I think I saw him, too.
And what about Tetsuo?
Why the hell wouldn't they tell us what hospital he's in?
What did you say?!
I was just wondering if you wanted to grab some tea or something over there.
I figured we could have a nice, long talk about that "revolution" deal.
Skirt-chasers will try anything these days...
You'll help anyone so long as it's a girl, won't you?
No way! I have high standards!
No way! I have high standards!
It's not their looks that count.
It's their... I dunno, their sensitivity that makes me do it.
I suppose I owe you one.
Thank you very much, uh...
I'm Kaneda.
Nice to meet you.
See you around, Kaneda.
You're leaving already?
Don't be like that!
Hey, come on!
I did save you and all!
At least tell me your name, you bitch!
I'll try talking with them for the time being, but it's risky.
If they think you're trying to avoid taking responsibility, it'll blow up in your face.
I can't believe that there's a mole on the executive council.
Even if that's true...
That isn't important.
What's important is diplomacy and political maneuvering, which you seem to despise.
I never studied them in school, you see.
I n any case, at the next executive council meeting, your poor management of this last incident will be called into question.
There 's a phone call for the Colonel.
You should put your affairs in order.
It's me.
This way, Colonel.
I'm terribly sorry to call you here, but there's something you really must see.
Please observe.
It's the special pattern from that young boy.
It doesn't resemble any I've seen so far, and I've never seen a developmental speed or confiiguration like this.
It may have begun with the shock of contact with Number 26, or possibly...
Have you finished running a comparison with Akira's pattern?
I'll superimpose it over this one.
This projection was constructed using mixed data, so a comparison is difficult, but I believe this boy's pattern is the key to solving...
...the riddle of Akira's pattern growth process.
All right. Continue.
Very well, sir. Thank you.
I'm sure he'll turn out to be a worthy addition to the Numbers.
It may be rough on him, but I thought we might try starting him off with level 7 capsules.
Is it safe?
Leave everything to me.
That's not what I meant!
I'm asking that if he turns out to have power like Akira's like you said, will we be able to control it?
Well, that's--
Can I leave this to you?
Well, if we use the latest examination equipment to collect even more data...
...and do a multifaceted analysis, then surely...
Maybe we shouldn't touch that power.
The power of God?
A... ki... ra...
But we have to.
We have to touch it and control it.
If it looks like it's too much for us to handle, terminate him at once!
There can be no hesitation!
Very well, Colonel.
This school is your last chance!
If trash like you that can't keep up with the academic ability of regular students...
...and can't adapt to living in a group screw up here, it's the end of the road!
Even if you're under 15, if you get more than 50 penalty points on your record, you're sent to the regular courts!
Bite me! Don't mess with us, you bald goat!
Aren't any of you listening?
You lost me halfway through!
Discipline!
Discipline!
- Discipline!
- OW!
Discipline!
Discipline!
Discipline!
Dismissed!
Thank you very much, sir!
You bastard! You and me are gonna go at it someday, jack!
We're gonna remember this!
I hope you rot and die!
You sick bastard!
Shit...
Yamagata!
What happened to your cheek?
Shut the hell up.
Let me guess, Jaws from P.E.?
They say you fought the Clowns on a highway in the old city!
Yeah.
Why don't you just wipe 'em out?
Those guys are so gross!
And last night...
There were demonstrators, cops, and even the damn army!
And that idiot Tetsuo had an accident, too.
What happened to Tetsuo?
He's in the hospital, I guess, but we don't know where.
The idiot was trying to show off.
That idiot...
What, you mean Tetsuo?
Shut up! I've had enough of your damn flirting!
What's gotten into you?!
Tetsuo? It's time for your medication.
Doctor! There's a problem!
I can't. The dorm mother throws a fit if you go out before 10.
Yeah, the one with the face like a goat.
That old bag's such a pain... She's always yammering on and on and on.
Tomorrow at three?
Sure, that'd be okay.
Hey, what happened to that girl a while back?
I don't like her much. Her personality just gets on my nerves.
Kaori...
Tetsuo!
Everyone's been worried about you!
They thought you might be dead.
When I woke up, I was on an operating table or something.
And that examination...
It's like... they were messing around inside my head.
I don't want to go back there.
Let's run away...
Where?
Someplace. Someplace far away.
- What's your problem?
- That's mine!
I wanna get laid!
Hey! Today's independent study!
Say what? What about my burning desire to study?!
Drag his butt in here!
Kaneda! Your bike!
My bike?
Look!
Tetsuo!
Are you sure this is okay?
Shut up! Just keep quiet and hang on!
Huh?
What's wrong?
Shit!
Oh, no...
We're stopping...
We stopped.
Oh, okay. The engine can't drop below
5,000 even when you're changing gears.
- My butt hurts.
- Okay, I get it...
Look, bikes!
Is that Kaneda and...?
It's not them!
Kaori!
Any sign of him?
Kuwata and the others went to look around Kisarazu.
All that's left now is the industrial area!
Okay, let's go!
We owe you for the other night!
Shut up!
Kaori! What did they do, Kaori?!
Don't! If you so much as scratch that bike, I'm gonna kill you!
Run!
Don't let 'em get away!
Wait!
Tetsuo!
That's enough, Tetsuo!
Are you trying to kill him?
Yes! I'm gonna kill him!
I'll split his damn head open!
Knock it off!.
This happened because you took my bike for a joyride.
- Enough, already!
- Shut up! Don't order me around!
We were worried about you.
Why do you always have to come and save me?
I could've handled it myself!.
I admit I got beat up that one time, but I won't always be on the receiving end!
Understand?!
Tetsuo...
Shut up! Stay away from me!
Hey, wait!
Where are you going?
Leave me alone!
Akira!
Tetsuo!
What's wrong?
Akira!
I don't know who that is!
Tetsuo, are you...
Hey!
This is strange.
I'm getting a blue pattern on scope #3!
Oh, no! Retrieve the subject! Hurry!
What're you doing to my friend?!
What's with you? You just come back from a funeral?
Tetsuo!
Kaneda!
Shit...
Wait!
Hey, Kaneda...
I see we have some youngsters doing their thing in spite of the tight checkpoints.
That just means that they're stupid, don't it?
This is boring.
Hey, let's go home.
But it's still early!
Yeah, but without their bikes they're just skirt-chasers out of water.
You mean "fish"!
Come on, let's go.
Let's toss these fish back!
Hey, Kaneda, what're we gonna do?
What the--?
Look!
That's...
Here we go again... Let's get out of here before we get involved again.
Huh?
Kaneda?
Hey!
This area is being cordoned off due to a terrorist bombing.
Those who wish to get through, line up in single file, present your ID and go through the checkpoint.
Get in.
What's wrong? Hurry.
I'll be right behind you.
You know the rendezvous point, right?
- Be careful.
- You too, Ryu.
Stop! Stop, damn it!
She's got a gun!
Okay, that's far enough!
Drop the gun!
Drop it now!
Stop!
I think it came from over here!
- There were two shots!
- No, three!
It's just up ahead!
Hey. Let's get out of here.
Come on!
Kaneda!
So, what's the matter?
Try telling me about it.
I had a dream.
A dream?
The city will be covered by a dark shadow and start to crumble.
Lots of people died...
...and we met Akira again.
Akira?!
The city will crumble, and so many people will die...
When?! When will it happen, Kiyoko?!
You mustn't let that boy go.
His power, it...
What did she mean?!
Well, there's nothing physically wrong with her.
Her medication is normal, too.
There's no sign of any abnormalities in her ECG or EEG, either.
I think what Number 25 said was her precognitive power at work.
This must be presented to the supreme executive council for inquiry, but...
Do you believe her?
I have no doubts regarding
Number 25's abilities.
We have all sorts of data that substantiate her abilities.
What about you, Colonel?
My job isn't to believe or disbelieve.
It's to act or not to act.
Here, sir.
Cold gear, Colonel.
Please put it on. You, too, Doctor.
The other day, a young researcher asked me something.
He wondered if their power was the form the next stage of human evolution was taking, and perhaps that we'll all be able to control it some day.
Scientists are a bunch of romantics.
Military men always consider the risks first.
It's taken thirty long years.
We've come so far from the rubble.
We can't just trade one for the other.
I've always thought that you hated this city, Colonel.
The passion to build has cooled and the joy of reconstruction forgotten, and now it's just a garbage heap made up of hedonistic fools.
So you're trying to save the city, then.
It's how a soldier thinks.
A scientist wouldn't understand.
Colonel, we're here.
This way, sir.
Room 10, 148 degrees Kelvin.
Fluctuation tolerance range, check.
Room 9, 118 degrees Kelvin.
Fluctuation tolerance, check.
Emergency power generator, check.
- Open it.
- Yes, sir.
Uh...
Go to the Control Room!
Yes sir!
Room 1 is at 0.0005 degrees Kelvin.
It's within tolerances.
No abnormalities detected in any of the rooms'...
...Dewar Walls or in the defense system.
No abnormal atmospheric concentrations or reactions recorded.
All systems nominal, then?
Look at what they abandoned in their panic. They were afraid!
They were too scared, so they hid it away from the public.
They forgot all shame and honor...
...and cast off the civilization and science we had created, and shut the lid of the Pandora's
Box they themselves had opened.
- Ryu!
- Hey, we're still young.
I think we can start over.
I'll go with you to the police.
- Ryu!
- Come on, turn yourself in!
That was the first time you ever killed somebody, right?
Ryu!
Anyway, once you've purified your body and soul,
Let's go out for tea or something.
Don't kick yourself over it, okay?
What's done is done.
The guy's dead.
Who're you?!
Ryu! You're okay!
- Kei, is that you?
- Ryu!
Who's this?
Who, me?
Well, I guess saying I'm Kei's boyfriend might be stretching it a bit.
But we haven't gotten physical or anything yet, understand?
- Are you a spy?!
- No!
Liar!
Is he really okay?
All I know for sure is that he's not a spy.
Ow...
Sneak into their lab?!
Are you serious? Don't you remember the fiasco with that kid?!
Last-minute orders.
Besides, the plan's already in place.
The lab passes they issue once a week...
They're from Mr. Nezu?
What's the objective?
Detailed data on the new subject.
New subject?
Yes. Last week, on the night we tried to abduct the subject called Number 26, a boy who was in an accident on an old city highway was brought to the lab.
Looks like he's a student at a vocational training school, but he's now their new subject for human experimentation.
Ow!
OW! What's the big idea?!
- You!
- He heard us! Let's kill him!
Ryu!
W-Wait a minute! Listen to me!
Listen to what I have to say!
He saved me!
Twice!
Maybe it was just to get close to us.
The guy who was in that accident in the old city is a friend of mine!
I know it's hard to believe, but it's the truth!
I was there when it happened!
Don't they say the only foolish questions are unasked ones?
Huh? They don't?
That's an intriguing story.
Will you be taking the boy with you?
He knows the subject, and I think we can use him as a decoy if necessary.
Neo Tokyo is going to change.
I n all respects, this city is saturated.
It's like an overripe fruit.
And within it is a new seed.
We only need to wait for the wind which will make it fall.
The wind called Akira!
Ryu, look!
What is it?
We aren't the ones who will change it, but rather, those citizens who hope for Akira will.
That which is called science perverts providence!
That which is called progress encourages extravagance!
That which is called civilization devastates the spirit of man!
The time of a tonement is upon us!
The time of his awakening is nigh!
The time of Lord Akira's awakening draws near!
Are your hearts prepared?!
Holding meetings here is prohibited!
Break up this illegal gathering!
Terrorist activities carried out by...
...anti-government elements have skyrocketed this month.
The army, riot police, and even traffiic police have been fully mobilized.
The overtime costs alone have used up the public safety budget.
And then there's the abduction of Number 26!
Isn't their existence supposed to be highest of state secrets?
No one's ever heard of "Peace and
Order" here in Neo Tokyo, then?
And then there's this request of yours...
...for further funding because of subject Number 25's prediction.
You must be joking!
We Parliament members have been begging the public to bear with us...
...while we straighten out the former Prime
Minister's historic tax reform blunders, so where, exactly, are we supposed to get that kind of money?!
You've spent a fortune, and all we have to show for it is that grotesque kindergarten!
The Olympics are next year.
The postwar period is over.
How much longer will you keep spending money on some ghost?!
I always said that we should've put that money into the welfare program!
- Shut up, old man!
- What?!
That power is starting to walk around free as we speak.
Unless we control it now, we'll lose everything!
Who do you think you're talking to, youngster?
It was your lack of policy that started this mess in the first place!
There's still no proof that the last
World War was caused by Akira!
Won't you even try to understand anything at all...
...unless an Akira disaster actually happens?!
Has anyone actually seen this "Akira"?
Wasn't Akira Number 25?
No, I think he was Number 21...
The Colonel has lost sight of his duty as a soldier.
I've had reports that anti-government elements are using...
...this "Akira" madness of yours as an excuse to whip up their terrorist fervor!
No! That's untrue!
Then what about that Akira world renewal movement?
Wouldn't you say that information's being leaked?
World renewal movement?
End of the world, more like!
Aren't you just using Akira as camouflage to cover up your misconduct?
What are you getting at?
Colonel, we can no longer leave the peace...
...of Neo Tokyo to your sole discretion.
Right!
You are to be put before an inquiry committee.
I agree!
Excuse me!
Colonel!
Colonel, where are you--
Wait! This discussion isn't over yet!
Explain yourself!.
Are you trying to insult the supreme executive council?!
Colonel...!
Wait, Colonel!
W-Water...
Hey, wait a minute...
Isn't that cable replacement scheduled for next week?
The cable they ordered came in early.
Besides, I'm going on vacation at the end of the week.
Besides, I'm going on vacation at the end of the week.
I've brought some workers with me, too.
I could take it back, but the work's gonna be done sooner or later.
Okay, let's go.
What the--?
Milk?
Stay away!
- Blood!
- I'm scared! jerk!
W-Who the hell are they?
Room 887, Tetsuo Shima...
A problem with the automatic lock?
Hey! You can't just walk off from your room!
Come on, let's go back.
What the hell happened?
What a mess!
There are 58 blocks with circuits that the computer won't display.
Of those, nearly 40 are concentrated on underground levels 7 and 8.
That's probably the place.
The central wiring shaft should be up ahead.
We should be able to use it to go straight to the sublevels.
Be careful, it's deeper in the middle.
- What a stink!
- Quiet!
What? I said it stinks because it stinks!
- Is your nose busted?
- Hurry up and stay quiet!
Damn! Hide!
Huh? Where?
What're you doing, you idiot?!
They left?
Looks like they've beefed up security.
Must be that siren we heard.
What should we do?
Scout around some?
No.
- Are you okay?
- Let's keep going.
I want to check out their security at the very least.
All right.
We've been spotted! Run!
Shit!
Don't! Don't shoot!
Shimazaki! Shit!
Forget about him! Run!
What the hell is that?
Here it comes!
Forget it! You can't do any good!
Die!
This is Unit 304, Shaft H!
Have encountered intruders and am engaging! Request backup!
Here it comes!
Kei!
Where's that gun?!
Damn it...!
Kaneda!
Kei, this way!
Hurry!
Kaneda, hurry!
Kaneda!
The brakes!
Where are the brakes?!
That's not it?
This is the central wiring shaft!
It's gotta be this one, then!
Okay, I'm getting the hang of this!
Ask the Colonel for clearance to fire!
- Turn that up!
- There must be some mistake.
That boy looks like the patient they admitted to the lab.
The boy, the subject named
Tetsuo Shima, broke out of his room.
I think he's headed for the Baby Room.
Tetsuo?!
He is an extremely dangerous state!
Don't let him through!
I repeat, do not let him through!
What the--?
It's no use hiding.
We have no choice, then.
Use your guns!
We can't let him go any farther, no matter what it takes!
Fire!
So, here you are...
Stop it!
How long are you gonna keep playing around?!
Where'd the other one go?
Why, you...
Die!
Takashi!
What the hell is going on?
Am I dreaming or something?
I never knew I had powers like this!
Damn it, which way should I go?!
Straight. Straight ahead...
Huh?
There's a freight elevator.
We can take it to sublevel 8.
Good, you're all together.
You thought you could kill me?
You tried to mess with me...
I'm gonna kill you!
That was you--
Takashi!
Attack him together!
O-Okay.
You little twerps!
That's enough!
All of you!
Who the hell are you?!
What's the matter? Does your head hurt, Tetsuo Shima?
Your power isn't fully matured.
If you push yourself, you might do irreparable damage. just do as we tell you.
What the hell did you people do to my head?!
Calm yourself, Tetsuo Shima!
He can't control it.
What?!
She said that big people like you should never use the power like that.
She says something horrible will happen.
Mind your own business.
What? More powerful than me?
He 's the one! He's been popping in and out of my head lately!
- Where is he?! Where's this "Akira"?!
- What?!
Kiyoko said that you'll awaken Akira.
If that happens, no one will be able to stop him.
So before that can happen, we have to stop you.
Impossible! Akira's already--
WH ERE IS H E?!
Stop it!
Shut up!
Threat level to facility integrity has passed level 7..
Enacting disaster protocols.
Threat level to facility integrity has passed level 7..
Enacting disaster protocols.
What the--?!
Hands up!
Where the hell is the " Baby Room"?!
Oh, no! Run!
Gangway, coming through!
Coming through!
Damn it, move!
Kiyoko...
Damn, that hurt...
Kaneda? What're you doing here?
Tetsuo! Are you okay?
I'm here to rescue you!
Hurry up, you moron! If we don't get out of here, those guys outside are gonna--
There he is! Catch him!
Stay away from me!
Kaneda!
Oh, right. I forgot you were there, Kaneda.
That's okay, Kaneda.
I won't be needing you to save me anymore.
From now on,
I'll be saving you.
All you have to do is ask, Kanny.
Say what? Who the hell do you think you're talking to?!
You don't like the way I talk?
Does it make you mad?
Well, what're you gonna do about it?!
Huh, Kaneda?! What're you gonna do about it?!
That's enough!
Don't hurt anyone else!
Where's this "Akira" guy?!
He...
The Olympic stadium...?
I n an underground facility?
No! You're wrong! Akira is--
Wait!
What the hell?
I can do this, too?!
Kiyoko, are you okay?
It doesn't look like she's hurt.
What about you, Masaru?
You're bleeding.
What happened to him?
He flew away.
How can he have so much power...?
How could this have happened?
Is anyone here?
He's developed so much power in such a short time...
Find him! Find Tetsuo!
- Find him! Go after him!
- Kaneda! Hang on, Kaneda!
Hurry up!
Get that rubble cleared!
He went to where Akira is.
What?
You're all safe!
He's heading for the facility below the Olympic construction site.
How did Tetsuo find out about that?!
You mean he's gone outside?
Damn it! We'll follow him!
Prepare for pursuit!
- Yes sir!
- He's heading west!
He's heading for the
Olympic construction site!
Tell them to beef up their security!
- You...!
- Set up checkpoints on all...
According to the defense team, intruders were encountered in the wiring shaft.
Two disguised as workers resisted and were shot, and the rest are at large.
He has to be stopped before his powers mature...
Your objective is the boy Tetsuo Shima.
If we are unable to capture him, you will lure him out to the old city and attack.
Request assistance from the
Eastern District Battalion.
- Yes sir!
- Tell them there isn't a moment to lose!
I've been waiting for you, Colonel.
Who the hell are you?!
I'm here to inform you of the supreme executive council's decision.
At 2400 hours today, the Colonel is hereby stripped of his command and rank, and will be placed under arrest.
What?!
Please come with us.
You expect me to hand Neo Tokyo over to those fools at a time like this?
- Shoot him.
- Yes sir!
What?
W-Wait!
Enough! Open your eyes and look at the big picture!
We can't dance to the tune of corrupt politicians and capitalists!
Don't you understand?!
It's pointless to fight anymore!
Announce a state of emergency, arrest all members of the executive council...
...and remove them from the chain of command!
We're going after Tetsuo!
Urgent message to all district battalion commanders!
Hey, what's up?
You by yourself?
Weren't you in an accident or something?
Everybody's been worried.
So, you feeling better?
Gimme some... capsules.
Hey, are you sure about that?
You don't look so hot. just hand 'em over!
All right, if you say so.
But with all those demonstrations and terrorist attacks lately, things are rough.
They're hard to come by, so they're pretty expensive.
Tetsuo's run off, Kaneda's disappeared...
I guess the team's fiinished.
And the checkpoints are so strict, even the Clowns are staying put.
What's wrong?
He's dead!
What?!
What the--?
Tetsuo?
What are you doing here?
You want some, too?
What are you talking about, damn it?!
What the hell happened here?!
The barkeep's dead!
A fish out of water dies, huh?
You are Tetsuo... Aren't you?
Kaneda sends his regards.
You saw Kaneda?!
He's probably dead by now...
You did this, Tetsuo?
So anyway... Where's Kaneda's bike?
Tetsuo!
I don't need a piece of junk like that anymore...
You son of a...
Yamagata!
Shit...
He went to where Akira is?
That's what that girl said.
The army, you, and Ryu are all looking for this "Akira" guy, so that's why you're chasing after Tetsuo.
It has something to do with that power of Tetsuo's, right?
What the hell is this "Akira" thing you keep talking about?
Ryu told me about it once.
He said that Akira is absolute energy.
Absolute energy?
Humans do all kinds of things during their lifetime, right?
Discovering things, building things...
Things like houses, motorcycles, bridges, cities, and rockets...
All that knowledge and energy...
Where do you suppose it comes from?
Humans were like monkeys once, right?
And before that, like reptiles and fish.
And before that, plankton and amoebas.
Even creatures like those have incredible energy inside them.
Because of genes, I guess.
And even before that, maybe there were genes in the water and air.
Even in space dust, too, I bet.
If that's true, what memories are hidden in it?
The beginning of the universe, maybe.
Or maybe even before that.
Hey, what's the matter?
Are you okay?
Did you get hit on the head back there?
Maybe everyone has those memories.
What if there were some mistake and the progression went wrong, and something like an amoeba were given power like a human's?
That's what Akira is?
Amoebas don't build houses and bridges.
They just devour all the food around them.
That's what Tetsuo's doing?
You're saying he has that kind of energy?!
A long time ago, there were people who tried to control that power.
At the government's request, you see.
They failed, and it triggered the Fall of Tokyo.
That power is still too much for--
What?!
The door's unlocked.
Huh?
This has got to be a trap.
Go back, then.
No, we ought to find out how much of it is a trap...
By the way, what's with you and that Ryu guy?
- What do you mean?
- You're always together.
That's none of your business!
What I'm saying is, he doesn't know about us, does he?
"Us"?
Hey, wait a minute!
What's that supposed to mean?
Do you think this will work?
It can't be helped. At this point, our only option is to use her.
The fact that she turned up right under our noses says as much, I think.
I guess...
Have arrived at Ward 13,
East Ginza intersection. Over.
Northern District battalion has not responded to mobilization request.
Special search team to HQ!
Special search team to HQ!
We 're at the Haruki-ya snack barnear the highway interchange in Ward 8.
It doesn't look like a bomb explosion, so we think it was him.
It was almost certainly the work of the subject that escaped from the lab.
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!
Understood!
Kaneda!
What?! Yamagata's dead?!
Something seemed strange about him from the second I saw him.
He was wearing what looked like a white hospital gown.
It was like he was a different person.
Yamagata asked him if he was really Tetsuo.
And then... Yamagata, he...
We've always been together.
I've known everything about him since we were in the children's home.
He was a klutz, and everybody made him cry.
Oh, right... He wanted to know where your bike was.
My bike...?
What're you gonna do?
I'm gonna send Yamagata his bike.
You dumb bastard!
Kaneda!
Kei!
What's wrong?
You! You were there that night...
Wait!
Kei!
They disappeared!
You were the ones who changed
Tetsuo too, weren't you?
Akira's power exists within everyone.
Who's there?!
But when that power is awakened, you must choose how to use it, even if you weren't prepared for it.
And he has made his choice.
Tetsuo is our newest companion.
We're partly to blame for his actions.
Why did you take Kei, then?!
We want her to help us.
You can't just use people like that!
Bring Kei back!
Tetsuo's our friend! If anyone's gonna kill him, it should be us!
Hey!
Damn it!
Mr. Omi and the other executives have been arrested by the coup...?
Y-Yes, that's right.
The house guards are fighting them right now.
Yes.
I'd like to have a helicopter waiting at West Haneda.
Yes.
That damned Colonel...
I can't believe he's taken up arms.
I underestimated him.
Hold them here! Damn!
Mr. Nezu...
R-Ryu?! Is that you?
I'm sorry, sir...
The mission was a failure.
What are you doing here?!
I've told you, you can't be seen here!
All of my men...
They've all been killed.
Y-You sold me out, didn't you, you bastard?!
What? You can't be--
Kei...
I got fresh fish in here, buddy!
I'm gonna get compensated for 'em, right?
Please, I have to catch a flight at noon!
What?
7th Avenue is just ahead!
It intersects this road
100 meters from here!
Prepare for battle!
Right, we've spotted the subject.
What? Attack?!
But he's just a...
We're attacking a boy?!
- Look! There he is!
- Impossible!
Is this for real?
Firing preparations complete.
Damn it! Fire!
- Akira!
- It's Lord Akira!
It's the advent of Lord Akira!
That's not him!
Don't be fooled!
That's not Lord Akira!
Shut up!
Long live Lord Akira!
Fire!
Huh?
What's wrong?
Neo Tokyo Broadcasting is exclusively covering the news...
...in spite of martial law in the name of freedom of the press!
What in the world is happening here in Neo Tokyo?
What you see here seems to be fires caused by tank cannons.
But who is this young boy?
Is he fighting the coup forces all by himself?
Viewers, the army has just illegall ordered us to land!
Freedom of thepress is now in jeopardy!
What happened?
Were they cut off?
The bridge! He's heading for the bridge!
Let's go see!
Are you really going alone?
He wants this, doesn't he?
We should call the gang together.
Hey!
I wouldn't want to keep him waiting.
Hey, Kaneda! Wait!
Half seem to be anti-government demonstrators.
The rest are... Well, they're more like some crazy cult than onlookers.
They're following after the subject, and more and more keep coming.
Oh, flames of purity, raze this corrupt city!
Consume our unclean hearts!
Fear not!
Your bodies will be purifiied in the flames!
Ready!
Fire!
Set the switch to hold for three seconds and converge your beams!
Aim!
Fire!
Watch this!
Look out!
Let's get out of here!
Help me!
Ground forces!
Ground forces, come in!
Report! What is the subject's status?!
Ground forces!
Call the Doctor.
We have confirmation of his recent movements and are in pursuit.
His present position is... Let's see...
Coordinates 99871 by 4332.
That's about2 km south of the Olympics construction site in the old city.
What?!
What was that?
Look!
That's near the toll booth that's being guarded by the 2nd platoon.
Wha--?
Huh?
Please turn around!
This area's off limits to civilians!
What? That's the subject?!
S-Stop!
Stop, damn it!
Nice place you have here.
Wait, you were with Kaneda.
You shouldn't use your power this way.
What?
I n the end, you won't be able to control it.
The kids...
You're those brats, aren't you?!
Okay, then...!
What the--?
It's not safe here, Colonel!
Well, what're you gonna do?
Open up!
What the hell?
That's Akira, Tetsuo!
That's the "Akira" you wanted to meet.
There's your Messiah!
After his transcendental awakening, his body was subjected to every test known to science.
And that's what was left of it.
The scientists back then were unable to solve the mystery, so they decided to entrust their collected data and test samples...
...to future generations by preserving them in a frozen capsule.
SOL... We'll use SOL!
Sir?
Akira is already dead!
Well? Are you satisfied now, Tetsuo?
So come back with us!
Like hell!
Contact the central defense center...
...and tell them to patch us through to SOL's control circuits!
Yes sir!
Hey, watch it!
Damn it, move!
Get out of the way!
What is this, science class?
What's wrong?
Have some trouble?
Yeah, but I already took care of it.
If you were here earlier, you could've watched the show.
You had me worried again.
I figured you'd be standing here, sobbing like a little baby.
Kaneda, you've always been a pain in the ass.
You've been telling me what to do ever since we were kids.
You always treat me like a kid.
You always show up and start bossing me around!
And now you're a boss, too...
Of this pile of rubble.
Kaneda!
That's Mister Kaneda to you, punk!
Die!
Tetsuo!
Son of a...
Kei!
Oh, hell!
Let's do it!
Got him!
Huh?
The battery?!
What's the matter, Kaneda?
God damn it!
This ain't fair, Tetsuo!
Fight with your bare hands!
Oh, this is funny...
Feeling frustrated, Kaneda?
Now do you understand how it feels?
What's this light?
Well, did you hit him?
We're too close to the impact point.
There's too much electrical interference.
Prepare a second volley!
Hey! Kaneda!
Tetsuo!
Shit...
Huh?
What the--?
Correcting for tracking system error.
T-minus-20 to energy alteration.
- Fire extinguishers!
- Are you okay?
Hurry! Hurry!
What happened?
What's going on?
Kaneda!
Kai! Kei!
- Kaneda!
- Kaneda!
- Get on!
- Get on? Where?
Hurry! Hurry!
What's that?
They say it's SOL.
Magnificent...
When Tetsuo's power reaches its peak?
That's when we do it.
But will it work?
The future doesn't proceed along a single course.
There ought to be a future we can choose.
What's Tetsuo's status?
Ah. Colonel...
We set up a camera in the stadium a while ago.
We have him under observation.
Colonel, you must take a look at this data!
We're still analyzing the energy given off by the subject, but...
It's magnificent.
Absolutely magnificent.
This is clearly a proton collapse.
We're also detecting a fair number of what we believe to be unknown particles.
If we can put this into a theoretical framework, physics--
No, science...
Humanity itself could touch the fundamental truths of the universe!
Oh. That's...
We still haven't finished making our adjustments.
Uh, Colonel!
T-That's...!
You bastard!
What did I tell you?!
B-But, Colonel!
I couldn't throw away such a magnificent subject!
Shut up!
Shit! It's on fire!
The battery! The battery!
My bike! It's burning up!
Hey, what's a bike or two?
What? Then there's nothing wrong with using yours, right?
You heard that?
Yeah, I did!
Hey, your bike's still on fire.
Tetsuo?
Tetsuo, why does everyone call you "Akira"?
He never existed in the first place.
They didn't care who it was. just so long as he destroyed things.
Your arm!
It doesn't look like much, but it works pretty good.
What's wrong? Are you okay?
It's nothing!
- Tetsuo...
- Shut up! Just go away!
Medicine...
What's wrong, Tetsuo?
Are you in pain?
Go back to the lab and get me some of that medicine!
Did you hear that, Doctor?
Yes, Colonel.
Well? Can you see any signs of it?
I'm not entirely certain, but it seems that the power that had been held back by the drugs is breaking free.
He may not be able to control power that has awakened so suddenly.
At any rate, he's in an extremely dangerous condition!
If you don't go back to the lab and receive proper treatment, you may die.
You want me to enroll in that kindergarten and live happily ever after?
Take my medicine every day and shrivel up like those kids?!
Kaori...
Kaori...
Please... I need that medicine...
No...!
Tetsuo!
Tetsuo!
Tetsuo--
Kaneda?!
Huh?
Son of a...
You kids... What are you doing here?
You never learn, do you?
Tetsuo!
Takashi...
Akira...
Kaneda...? H-Help me...!
Kaori...
Help me...!
Help me!
Stop it!
Kaori?
Kaori!
Kaori!
Tetsuo? Is that you, Tetsuo?!
Kaori! Kaori's gonna die!
What?! What did you say?!
My body's not doing what I tell it to!
My power's acting on its own...!
Kaori!
Kaori's dying!
Kaneda, help me!
Stop, Tetsuo!
Stop it!
Kaori's pain is coming into me...!
Tetsuo!
Kaneda! Run away!
Tetsuo!
Kiyoko! Takashi! Masaru!
Get away from here!
Come on!
I can't believe it. It's as if--
Kiyoko! Taka--
Hi, Akira.
Th-This is...
But that's-- Oh, no!
W-Where am I?
Hurry! Get into the tunnel!
You'll be safe in there.
Kiyoko! Where are you?
Tetsuo!
Kaneda!
Hang on!
If you don't get out of here now, you'll--
Out of the way!
Tetsuo!
Don't go!
No, Takashi!
If you went in now, you'd be trapped, too.
But none of this is his fault!
Takashi!
Takashi!
If we went in, we wouldn't be strong enough to come back out.
But if the three of us worked together, maybe we could at least save that boy.
You're right.
Together, the three of us could...
Oh, man...!
We should get out of here. Hey!
Kaneda...
Look, you're not revving your engine enough.
When you go into a corner, lean like you're trying to kill yourself. Watch!
What're you doing?
Cornering, man.
Got it, Tetsuo...?
Look, there's another one!
- Another transfer student?
- He was abandoned.
You can see it in his face.
Are... Are these your dreams, Tetsuo?
Wait!
This is Akira...?
Yes. We called him.
To have him take Tetsuo away.
Take him away?
Take him where?
It's too much for Tetsuo.
And for us. And for Akira.
It's too big for us as we are now.
But someday, we 'll also be able to...
You see, it's already begun.
Your friend's--
My friend?
Kei! You mean Kei, don't you?
Tetsuo...
This is yours, right?
They're always like that with the new kids.
You came today, right?
They beat me up, too.
But the truth is, those guys are wimps.
I'm Tetsuo. Tetsuo Shima.
To tell you the truth,
I just got here myself.
I'm--
Kaneda...
Kaneda?
- Kaneda!
- Kei?
W-What's happening?
What in the world is happening?
B-But this isn't...
If this is correct, it's almost as if...
Is this the birth of a universe?!
Kei!
What happened?
It's disappearing...!
It's disappearing!
Kaneda!
Tetsuo...
Kaneda...
Thanks.
You called to me, right?
I heard you.
Kaneda, don't tell me you're...
What about Tetsuo?
He left.
So did those three kids.
Akira, too.
Kaneda, back then, you...
Kaneda! You're alive?!
I thought you were in there for sure!
Tetsuo...
What happened to Tetsuo?
Is he dead?!
I'm not so sure.
But he's probably...
But someday, we 'll also be able to...
You see, it's already begun.
I am... Tetsuo.
You poor little fella.
It's all right.
Big Mama's here.
You know, you're gonna need some caring for.
Now... Now, let's see, darlin'.
You need, um...
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Not me. Not Big Mama, now.
Now I'm thinkin', though.
Mm-hmm. Oh, uh-huh.
Now... Now don't...
Don't you move, honey.
Big Mama's gonna be right back.
Good work, Boomer.
We'll get him this time.
Shh! I think he's in there.
Whew!
Am I glad I found you boys.
There's no time to lose.
I need your help. Now come on.
- Come on.
- Let's go, Boomer. Come on.
Yeah, but... Oh, shucks.
Oh, poor little guy.
Don't you worry now. We're going to find someone to look after you.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hey, I think I got an idea.
OK, Boomer, now you know what to do.
Yeah, leave it to me.
Leave it to me.
Who is it?
Well, I was sure I heard someone knocking.
Oh, dear! My laundry!
Oh, here! Stop it!
Oh, you pesky birds!
Will you come back here?
Oh, stop!
Well, I wonder what got into those birds.
Well, bless my soul!
Why, it's...
It's a baby fox.
Oh.
Hello, little fella.
I wonder where its mother is.
Come on, now. I'm not going to harm you.
Now, now. Oh, isn't that...?
Oh, my, my. You're a feisty little rascal, aren't you?
There, there, now. Calm down.
No, I just can't leave you out here all alone.
Oh, isn't he darling?
Now, not so fast.
Now, now, not so fast.
Oh, my. You're such a little toddler.
Say, that's what I'm going to call you.
Tod.
You know, Tod,
I'm not going to be so lonesome anymore.
I got a surprise for you, Chief, old boy.
Now, now, now, take it easy.
Well, how's this for a huntin' dog?
He's just a little runt now, but he'll grow.
You may as well get used to him, Chief.
He's for you to look after from now on.
Tod, stop pestering Abigail.
Abigail, you're going to have to be patient with Tod.
He's one of the family now.
Oh, of course. Now I know.
I declare, I never will get my chores done.
Oh, mercy!
Tod! Tod, stop it!
Abigail! Abigail!
Oh, no! There goes my milk! Oh, no!
Easy, easy, Abigail.
Steady, old girl. Steady.
There, there.
Tod, you come here.
I said come here!
Just look what you've done.
Now, don't try to butter me up.
Oh, Tod, I just can't stay angry with you.
You little imp. Now run along and play.
Go on.
And try to stay out of mischief.
Hey, it's Dinky and Boomer.
Maybe they wanna play.
Is this it, Boomer?
Sure, Dinky. This is the place.
I never forget a tree.
I never forget a tree.
He won't get away this time.
Hold it, Boomer. I think
I hear somethin'.
That's him, all right, Dinky.
That's him, all right.
Shh, shh. Get ready, Boomer.
Hey, I can hear him movin'. Listen.
That's funny. I don't hear nothin'.
Shh! Quiet.
Oh, that's him, Dinky.
That's him, all right.
Button your beak, will ya?
I'll check it out.
Would you look at that?
OK, Boomer, he's right... there.
Yikes! Watch it!
Why, you...
Nail him, Boomer! Sock it to him!
Hiya, fellas.
What ya doin'? Wanna play?
Stay outta this, kid.
This don't concern you.
Let him have it!
Don't let the creep get away!
You can take him, Boomer!
Give him a left! A right!
Let him have it!
Aaah!
- Which way did he go?
- This way.
There he is!
What happened to ya? Golly!
Oh, shucks! I think
I bent my b-b-beak.
Now see what you done?
You cost us our breakfast.
I cost us our breakfast?
It was your fault.
- What are you talkin', my fault?
- Yeah, yeah.
A worm? For breakfast?
Yuck! Blecch!
Hey, there, Copper, what ya sniff in' at?
Somethin'... I never smelled... before, Chief.
Huh. Let me see.
Ah, shucks, that's easy.
The master's just cookin' grits and fatback. You oughta know that.
Mm-mmm.
That's not what I smell.
I don't know, Chief.
It's something else.
Sonny, you got a lot of learnin' to do about a-sniffin' and a-smellin'.
Hey, where you goin'?
I want to find out what that smell is.
OK, Copper, but the master ain't gonna like you wanderin' off.
I won't get lost, Chief.
I can smell my way back.
Can't tell these young whippersnappers anything.
What ya smellin'?
I'm on the trail of somethin'.
Trail of what?
I don't know yet.
Why, it's... it's you!
What do you do that for?
We're supposed to do that when we find what we've been trackin'.
I'm a fox.
My name's Tod. What's your name, kid?
Mine's Copper. I'm a hound dog.
Gee, I bet you'd be good playin' hide-and-seek.
Wanna try it, Copper?
Can I use my nose?
Sure. OK.
Now go ahead and close your eyes and count.
One, two, three...
No, Copper! You can't peek!
- Oh.
- Now start again.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...
My, my. Look at that.
A fox and a hound, playin' together.
When you're the best of friends
Having so much fun together
You're not even aware you're such a funny pair
You're the best of friends
Life's a happy game
You could clown around forever
Neither one of you sees your natural boundaries
Life's one happy game
Copper!
Gee, I've gotta go.
If only the world wouldn't get in the way
If only people would just let you play
They say you're both being fools
You're breaking all the rules
They can't understand
The magic of your wonderland
When you're the best of friends
Copper!
Sharing all that you discover
When these moments have passed
Will that friendship last?
Who can say?
There's a way
Oh, I hope
I hope it never ends
Come on, Copper!
'Cause you're the best of friends
Copper, you're my very best friend.
And you're mine too, Tod.
And we'll always be friends forever, won't we?
Yeah, forever.
Hey, let's go swimmin'!
Give me a head start and I can beat ya!
Whoo!
Dagnabit! That Copper pup's gone and strayed off again.
Come on, Chief.
If that little rascal's gonna make me a good huntin' dog, he's gotta learn to mind.
Copper! Get over here!
Copper!
Uh-oh. I gotta go home.
Do ya have to? We're havin' too much fun.
I gotta. He sounds awful mad.
I'll see ya tomorrow!
- And don't forget!
- I won't!
Hey, Copper, what happened to ya?
Why didn't you...?
Golly! You're all tied up.
Yeah, and it's no fun either.
The master says I gotta stay home.
Well, we can play around here then.
Oh, no. Not with old
Chief over there.
Is that him making that awful noise?
He keeps me awake at night.
Oh, don't go in there!
He can get awful mean!
He's cranky.
Gee-whillikers, is he ever big.
His ears isn't as big as yours, Copper.
That's not the part you gotta worry about.
Wow! Look at those teeth.
That's the part you gotta worry about!
I'm gainin' on him.
- He won't get away now.
- He's wakin' up!
Get out, Tod!
No. He's havin' a dream.
He's chasin' somethin'.
When I get him cornered...
It's... It's... It's a big old badger.
Copper, he's chasin' a badger.
No, no, it ain't a badger.
It's a... It's a f...
It's a fox. A fox?
Run, Tod! Run!
Tod!
Amos Slade, you trigger-happy lunatic!
Give me that gun!
My radiator!
Why, you blasted female.
- I'll... I'll...
- Hold it right there!
Watch it! That thing's loaded!
Now it ain't loaded!
Dagnabit, woman! Your thievin' fox was after my chickens!
Rubbish and poppycock!
I don't believe it. He wouldn't hurt a thing.
You callin' me a liar, you muddleheaded female?
- I saw it happen!
- Amos Slade, that temper of yours is going to get you into a lot of trouble.
Temper?
Temper, woman? You ain't seen my temper!
If I ever catch that fox on my property again, I'll blast him!
And next time, I won't miss!
Poor little tyke.
It's a shame I have to keep him cooped up.
Tod, stop looking at me like that.
It's not my fault, you know.
You caused a lot of trouble yesterday.
Oh, now what are they up to?
Why, it looks like Amos is going on a hunting trip.
A long one, from the looks of it.
Hmm. Well, good riddance!
Doggone meddlin' female, shootin' up my radiator!
Dad blame it. Get goin'!
There. Well, that's more like it.
Keep runnin', old girl.
Well, Copper, me and old Chief are gonna teach you all about huntin'.
Yes, sir. It's about time too.
Attaboy.
Yeah, you're gonna like trackin' down those varmints for me.
Uh-uh. Get in the back, half-pint.
You gotta earn your right to sit up front.
Well, boys, we're gettin' outta here till next spring.
Tod, honey, what are you doin' over here?
Gee, I just wanted to say goodbye to Copper, but I'm too late.
Well, what did you plan to do if you ran into old Chief?
Ah, Chief. I can outfox that dumb old dog anytime.
Tod, now hold it just one minute.
Didn't you learn anything yesterday?
Now you listen good, Tod, because it's either education or elimination.
Now if you're so foxy and old Chief's so dumb, then why does that hound get the fox on the run?
'Cause he's got the hunter, and the hunter's got the gun. Ka-bam!
Elimination. Lack of education.
If you pal around with that Copper hound
You'll wind up hangin' on the wall
Keep your nose to the wind
You'll keep your skin
'Cause you won't be home when the hunter comes to call...
Oh, Big Mama, I know Copper would never track me down.
Why, old Copper, he's my best friend.
Your best friend.
Now, Copper's gonna do what he's been told.
Supposed to chase the little old fox into the old foxhole, then along comes the hunter with a buckshot load.
- Ka-ka-ka-bam!
- Elimination.
Lack of education.
You better believe it, Tod.
Yes, sirree!
You mean Copper is gonna be my enemy?
Hey!
Kid, you better step over here and take a good look.
Why... Why, that's awful.
Those poor things.
I'm sorry, Tod.
Honey, Copper's gonna come back a trained huntin' dog.
A real killer.
Oh, no, not my friend Copper.
He won't ever change.
I hope you're right, Tod.
And we'll keep on being friends forever.
Um, won't we, Big Mama?
Darlin', forever is a long, long time, and time has a way of changin' things.
Oh, Jiminy. It sure turned cold.
- I'm freezin' my b...
- Hey!
It's that fuzzy worm!
Let's get him!
Charge!
Hey, Dinky! Dinky, quick! Over here!
I got him! I got him!
Do I look like a worm?
That's who we're after.
Come on!
Look at that little creep, warm and cozy by the fire.
Let me take a look.
Now how do you like that guy?
Snug as a bug, while we're out here freezin' our b-b-b-beaks off.
Well, yackin' and shiverin' ain't gettin' us anywhere.
We'll get that no-good worm when we come back.
Oh, sh-sh-sh-shucks.
So long, Big Mama.
Yeah, we're goin' s-s-south for the winter.
Goodbye, boys. See ya next spring.
Well, look who's here.
Oh, my goodness.
I'm sorry, Tod, honey.
- I hope...
- Hiya, Big Mama.
We're back. We flew all the way.
Yeah, we did. We did.
Welcome home, boys!
It's been kind of lonesome around here without you little rascals.
Hi, fellas!
Hey, who's that? Who's that?
This can't be that scrawny little squirt we found by the fence post, can it? Come on.
I... I can't believe my eyes.
Oh, it's me, all right.
Hey, looky there. He's got himself a real fancy collar.
Hey, hey, hey. Just look at this bushy tail.
Beautiful.
Aw, come on. Cut it out. You guys are always teasin' me.
Hey, it's him, it's him. Squeeks.
We'll see ya later, kid.
We gotta take care of some unfinished business.
I can't understand.
It was so healthy.
There. That oughta perk it up.
Now, where'd he go? Where'd he go?
He's goin' up the drainpipe!
I'll head him off.
OK, Boomer, we got him trapped! Let him have it!
Aah!
- Did you get him?
- No, I didn't.
Neither did I.
Come on! Look!
A caterpillar under glass. Oh, boy!
- Holy!
- Smoke!
Hey, hey, how's he do that,
Dinky? How's he do that?
I ain't got no job
I'm a huntin' man
And I'd rather have a dog than a dollar
So let's go banjo ring-a-ling-a-ding-ho
Give a little hoot and a holler
Aw, come on, Chief.
Just 'cause you're not sittin' up front, that ain't no reason to be a sorehead.
Shucks, if it weren't for you,
Copper'd never have turned into a good huntin' dog.
Yes, sirree.
Now I got me the best two dogs there is.
Right, Copper?
Isn't he somethin', Chief?
Look, Big Mama! Copper's back!
Boy, has he grown big.
Uh-huh.
And look at that big pile of skins he helped track down.
I know, Big Mama. He's a huntin' dog now.
You're right. And you're a fox.
Ah, that won't make any difference.
Copper's gonna be glad to see me.
Well, honey, just don't get your hopes too high.
Look, don't worry. I'll be careful.
I'll go tonight when Chief and the hunter are asleep.
Boy, it's great to be back home, isn't it, Chief?
Aw, come on, Chief. You aren't still sore, are ya?
Hey, hey, come on. Let's scuffle.
We ain't scuffled in a long time.
Come on, Chief!
Let's have some fun!
Oh, lay off, Copper, you overgrown pup, you.
Oh, let go!
Dagnabit! Let go, I say!
Oh, OK, OK.
That was your trouble on the hunt.
Aw, come on, old-timer.
You treat me like a pup, you know that?
Why, I think I done real good trackin' down them varmints for ya.
Smellin' and trackin' ain't enough.
You gotta think nasty.
OK, OK, I know.
I know.
Copper.
Hey, Copper.
It's me, Tod.
I thought that was you,
Tod. I heard ya comin'.
Boy, you've really grown.
You have too, Copper.
I saw you comin' back with
Chief and the hunter.
It's great to see ya, Tod.
But, you know, you...
You shouldn't be over here.
You're gonna get us both into a lot of trouble.
Hey, look, I... I just wanted to see ya.
We're... We're still friends, aren't we?
Tod, those days are over.
I'm... I'm a huntin' dog now.
You'd better get outta here before old Chief wakes up.
Oh, Chief. He doesn't worry me.
Tod, I'm serious. You're...
You're fair game as far as he's concerned.
It's that fox again!
Oh, no! No!
They're after Tod!
After him, boys! Go get him!
Copper!
Copper! Copper!
Tod, I...
I don't wanna see you get killed.
Track him down, boy!
I'll let you go this one time.
Don't lose him!
There they are! Old Chief's got him on the run!
Jump, Chief! Jump!
Chief!
Chief?
Oh, no!
No!
Tod, if it's the last thing I do, I'll...
I'll get you for this!
Tod!
Tod? Tod!
Oh, Tod!
Thank heaven you're safe.
Oh, poor Chief.
And it's all my fault.
I shouldn't have let Tod go.
Big Mama! Wake up! Wake up!
There's trouble!
Tod! Well, what is it?
What on earth?
Widow, get out here!
Why, Amos! What are you...?
Where is he? Where is he?
I know he's in there.
Now just a minute.
You can't come bargin' onto my property, Amos Slade!
That fox of yours almost killed Chief, and I'm gonna get him!
You can't keep him locked up forever!
We met, it seems
Such a short time ago
You looked at me
Needing me so
Yet from your sadness
Our happiness grew
And I found out I needed you too
I remember how we used to play
I recall those rainy days
The fire's glow
That kept us warm
And now I find
We're both alone
Goodbye may seem forever
Farewell is like the end
But in my heart's the memory
And there... you'll always be
Goodbye may seem forever
Farewell is like the end
But in my heart's the memory
And there you'll always be
Hold it, sonny! Back off!
Consarn it! Where...? Where do you think you're goin'?
Oh, oh, excuse me, I...
I was just trying to...
You barge in on somebody's house like you own it.
Tarryhootin' around them woods, wakin' up folks in the middle of the night.
I honestly didn't know anybody lived here, and I...
Well, you know it now.
Now get off my property!
Go on! Beat it!
I've been watching you, sir. You can stay with me if you want to.
- That's very nice of you.
- Come with me.
She dropped that fox off at the game preserve.
We'll get him. We'll get him.
Well, now, if you gotta have a busted leg, ah, this is the way to do it.
Good food, soft pillow, warm stove.
Sure beats sleepin' in that barrel.
Well, now, here comes visitors to see the invalid.
How do you like that? They didn't even ask how I'm feelin'.
Chief, get back in there before I break your other leg.
Copper, Copper, lookit here.
Now, when that fox comes traipsin' along, suspectin' nothin'...
Tod?
Tod?
Oh, boy. These old wings ain't what they used to be.
Big Mama, you better lose a few pounds.
Uh-oh, uh-oh, there he is, there he is.
Tod!
Tod!
Oh, hi, Big Mama.
Oh, it's you, Vixey.
Hey, what brings you way out here?
I'm lookin' for a fox named Tod.
- He's new here in the forest.
- Oh, new? Um...
Well, what does he look like?
Oh, he's young. About your age.
And handsome.
Handsome? Oh, say.
Gee, uh, he sure sounds nice.
Uh, I'm not doing anything.
I'll help you find him.
Come on. He's gotta be around here somewhere.
Wham?
What happened? Where am I?
So, it's you again, hmm?
You barged in on me last night, and now you...
I... I didn't mean to.
Just look at the... mess you made.
Dagnabit, you clumsy bonehead!
I'm sorry. It was an accident.
Excuses, excuses.
Mr. Digger, sir? It was so too an accident.
You keep out of this, you walkin' pincushion.
You shouldn't be so grumpy to someone who's new in the neighborhood.
A stranger, eh?
Why don't you go back where you came from?
Wham?
Well, go on.
Get goin'. Git!
Aww.
Gosh, he seems so... I don't know, so downhearted, Big Mama.
Well, you can't blame him, honey.
He was dropped out here and left all alone without a friend in the world.
Well, maybe there's something I could do.
You know, cheer him up.
Honey, you just said the magic words.
Now...
What? But Big Mama, I don't...
Darlin', don't move.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
Mornin', Tod.
Hello, Big Mama.
Last night was pretty miserable for you, wasn't it, honey?
Just terrible.
Cheer up and look around.
The forest is beautiful this morning.
After last night, nothin' looks beautiful.
Wow!
Who...? Who is that?
Oh, just another fox.
A lady fox.
Golly!
Is she beautiful!
I wonder what her name is.
Well, why don't you go ask her?
Yeah. Yeah, guess... Guess I will.
I'll... I'll go up to her and I'll say, "You're the most gorgeous...
The most beautiful...
Never seen anyone, anywhere..." I'll say...
Hi.
Hello.
- Big Mama told me, you know...
- I just happened to be...
May I call you by your first name?
Oh. Sure. Why not?
Thanks, but what...?
What is your first name?
- Vixey.
- Vixey.
Uh-huh.
My name is... is... uh, Tod.
Tod?
That's a... That's a nice name, Tod.
It looks like that farm boy is makin' it b-b-big with her.
Shh! Now just keep it down.
Well, Tod, you know something?
This stream is just full of trout.
Do you think you could catch one?
- One what?
- One what? Fish, silly!
Oh, oh, yeah! Oh, yeah.
My dear young lady... you happen to be looking at an expert... fisher fox.
Oh, Tod, Tod. Don't overdo it.
I know all the tricks.
In fact, I... I never miss.
Please let him catch a fish.
Here comes a whopper!
Now, watch closely.
Tod, do you need help?
No. No, I... I do it this way all... all the... all the time!
I got him.
Oh, that farm boy, he don't know nothin' about f-f-fishin'.
He ain't gonna hook her that way.
Oh, gosh!
Tod, you're the funniest thing I ever saw!
Go ahead! Go ahead and laugh!
You're like everyone else around here.
I'm sorry. I can't help it.
You are so funny.
So I can't fish!
You're a silly, empty-headed... female!
Now just a minute.
I mean, you've got a nerve.
Why don't you grow up?
Tod, that's no way to talk to Vixey.
Oh, raspberries! I've had it.
Honey, don't stay mad.
You gotta be natural. That's the trick. Can't you see?
When you have a natural attraction
You deserve a mutual reaction
You're gonna get a whole lot
Of satisfaction
Here's all you gotta do
When you feel that
Natural affection
Leads you in the positive direction
You gotta stop showin' off
Start showin' up
With little old natural you
Yes, you gotta appreciate the lady
And now that is a natural fact
'Cause when you be yourself
With the lady, yeah
You gonna get appreciated
Right back
Shh.
- But Big Mama...
- It's just getting interesting.
Tod, I...
I just know you're gonna love the forest.
Listen, come on. Let me show you around.
Sure.
Come on.
Look. One, two, three, four, five, six.
Seven.
I think six would be just right.
Six?
Six what?
"No hunting."
Well, now, we ain't gonna do none of that, are we, Copper?
We're just gonna get us a no-good fox.
All right, boy, get trackin'.
Smell him out.
What ya got there, Copper?
Good work, boy.
He'll be comin' right through here, headin' for water.
But he won't be drinkin' any.
What a beautiful morning, Vixey.
You know, I've never been happier.
Oh, Tod, me too.
That does it.
Amos, you crafty old coot.
The devil himself couldn't have done no better.
Tod?
- Tod, wait a minute.
- What is it, Vixey?
I don't wanna go in there. It's too quiet.
Oh, Vixey.
What?
Tod, be careful.
Dad blast it! He's gettin' away!
Quick, Vixey!
Go on, head for the burrow.
Quick, Vixey. Out the back.
Tod!
Oh, no, Tod.
Cooper! Copper!
We got 'em now for sure.
This is their only way out.
Steady, boy. Steady. Get ready.
Tod!
We're trapped!
Tod, I'm scared.
Quick, Vixey! This is our only chance!
Whoa! No! I don't believe it!
Copper, we've trapped him now!
Ow!
Copper!
Tod!
Tod?
Come on, Copper. Get outta the way.
Well... come on, boy.
Let's go home.
Shh, Shh. This is it.
We got him for sure now.
Oh, my g-g-gosh!
- Whoa!
- Yoww!
What happened?
Hey, there's somethin' very familiar about those eyes, Dinky.
Nah, it couldn't be.
Could it?
Bye, Squeeks. Bye.
Good luck, honey.
Ouch! You're killin' me! Ouch!
Amos Slade, will you hold still?
You're behaving like a child.
Well, for gosh sakes, you're hurtin' my foot, woman!
- Nonsense! Your foot is mendin' fine.
- Ow!
You'll soon be yourself.
Oh, land sakes. I don't know if I like that.
Ow! Be careful! Ouch!
He's sure makin' a big fuss over a little old hurt leg.
Copper?
You're my very best friend.
And you're mine too, Tod.
And we'll always be friends forever, won't we?
Yeah, forever.
September 21 , 1 945.
That was the night I died.
Sο disgusting!
Watch it!
He's filthy.
Is he dead?
Such a disgraceful sight.
Dοn't want Αmericans tο see this!
Μama!
What day is it tοday?
Setsukο...
Αnοther οne...
What's this?
Dοn't bοther.
Just tοss it.

Τhοse blank eyes tell yοu it's ονer.

Υes, in care οf Kure Naνal Base.

Oνer ten days agο, after we came here.
Τhat's strange.
He hasn't replied tο me either.
Setsukο, be sure tο return thοse.
Hοw is the war situatiοn?
Getting wοrse, I'm afraid.
Factοries must step up fοr thοse that burned.
Αll we hear is
"Gear up fοr final battle. "
Fοοd ratiοns keep getting wοrse tοο.
We're all suffering in this war.
Μy girl is alsο wοrking fοr οur cοuntry.
Υοu must eat and put οn strength.

Τaking in twο mοre must be tοugh.

I hate shelters.
Hang in there.

Snip, snip, snip.

Sοmebοdy is sleeping.
Dοn't lοοk at that.
Summertime, I'll teach yοu hοw tο swim.
But I'll get hungry if I swim.
Seita!
Setsuko!
Come indoors!
You must be hungry!
Τhere are ice-cold drinks too!
Μama! Did you wait long?
I'm so glad you came.
How are you doing?
I'm doing fine.
Ενeryone is nice here.
I'm hungry.
Get up.
Τhere's an air raid coming.
I'm tired.
I want a piggyback ride.
Τo the shelters!
Υour mother won't need her kimono anymore.
Why not exchange it for rice?
I'νe been slowly trading my things for more food too.
Τhis should get about 1 5-kg.
1 5-kg...?!
Υou must also eat to build a strong body and go to war.
Τhis is worth 1 5-kg?
I'm sure your mother will be happier this way.
I'll take these now.
No!
Setsuko, you're awake.
Τhey're Μama's!
Τhey're Μama's!
No! Υou can't take them!
Setsuko, let go.
No, no, no!
Setsuko! Setsuko!
Isn't this fine rice?
Setsuko, we'll haνe steamed rice tonight.
Τhese are for you two to keep.
Look! It's rice, Setsuko.
Here you go.
Τhe two are working late.
Τoo bad they can't eat while it's hot.
Setsuko, isn't this rice yummy?
I want more!
Υes, dear.
Setsuko eats a lot when it's rice.
It tastes so good!
What's the matter?
I don't want porridge.
Αren't there any pickled plums?
Υou know they're long gone.
Here's your lunch.
Τhank you.
Haνe a nice day.
- I'll be off.
- Υou take care.
We'll haνe rice balls for lunch, so eat.
Εnough! Our lunch will be porridge!
Υou loafers expect to eat the same as those working for our country?!
Seita, you're old enough to understand about helping out.
Υou don't share your rice, but now you want more of ours. Τhat's unacceptable!
Giνe you a little bit of rice, and already you're spoiled!
But that's our rice.
Αre you saying your aunt isn't fair?
Υou sure talk big. Τhis is what I get for taking in two orphans?
Well then.
From now on, we'll eat separately.
That should be fair.
Seita, you haνe relatiνes in Τokyo, don't you?
One's on your mother's side?
Why don't you write to them?
Nishinomiya could be firebombed anytime.
But I don't haνe their address.
Let's hurry home.
Υes, Daddy is waiting for us.
Frogs are singing.
Let's go home.
Sorry for the long wait!
What is it?
I'm hungry.
I'm thirsty too.
Αlrighty.
Here, haνe a fruit drop.
Μama had 7,000 yen saνed in the bank.
7,000! Τhat's plenty to liνe on.
We're going to be all right.
I'm telling Dad to write back soon, because Setsuko is waiting.
Υou two are in luck.
Υou can't find such a good stoνe nowadays at any price.
Items are scarce, especially hardware.
Can't get those anywhere!
I'll take that comb, and do you haνe an umbrella?
I'm afraid not.
Oh, but wait.
Rain, rain, fall, fall.
So happy my big brother came
With an umbrella to take me home.
Splish-splish, splash-splash, la-la-la!
Good fire, huh?
Just be careful with that.
We will!
What's up with those two?
Τhey're cooking on their own now.
Τhat's νery noble of them.
Μore, please.
Μama, were you harsh on them again?
So I was, but they won't apologize.
Τhen they bought cooking equipment, just to spite me!
I'm done!
Τhat's bad manners, Seita.
Υou can relax too.
Τhat's for two.
Τhat's it?!
Τhe next ration should be in July.
Let me do it.
Is it sweet?
I can taste so many flaνors!
Grape, strawberry, melon, mint...
Setsuko, you can haνe it all.
It's all gone!
Gone to bed without washing their dishes!
Doing as they please.
Τhose brats are so annoying!
Not again!
Μama!
Seita! Others here are working for our country.
Αt least stop that girl's crying!
With the nightly raids and crying, how can we sleep?!
Chubu military area information.
Enemy bombers are flying north along the Kii Channel.
Are you going to the caνe again?
You're old enough to help fire fighting duties!
All clear!
I want to go home.
I hate liνing with our aunt.
We don't haνe a home.
It was burned.
E - D - C - D - E - A - G
E - E - E - D - C - D
Let's sing!
Carp streamers up higher than the roof.
The big black carp is the Dad.
Stop it!
Αre you crazy? We're at war!
I'll get yelled for that!
Υou pests bring us nothing but trouble!
Υou're useless in raids.
If you're so scared, then go liνe in that caνe!
Υou know what?
Τhis can be our home.
Nobody comes here. It's sturdy.
We can do whateνer we want.
It's all right to do that?
Thank you for eνerything.
We're going.
Going...?
Where to?
We're not sure yet.
Well, take care then.
Goodbye, Setsuko!
This will be the kitchen.
Τhis is the front door.
Where's the bathroom going to be?
Τhat can be anywhere.
I'll go with you.
Τhank you for the cart!
Just leaνe it there.
Could you sell us more straw and some food?
There isn't much to sell, but sure.
Τhere you go!
- Μy mouth is watering.
- I'm hungry!
Heard you could eat those too.
Frogs?
Τhey say they're good.
I'll do the rest.
Υou go wait in the net.
What is it?
I left my toothbrush.
Τhen don't brush tonight.
Υou'll get bug bites.
Stay inside the net.
It's dark and I'm scared.
I'll go for a pee.
Want to go too?
It's a kamikaze plane.
Looks like a firefly.
It does.
Hey, let's catch fireflies.
Get in.
I can see your face!
I can see you too.
Look, it's a hairpin.
Now, let's see a firefly light show!
Before you were born,
I went to a naνal reνiew.
Α naνal reνiew?
Dad was on the cruiser Maya.
The entire combined fleet was there!
Iron castle afloat on the sea.
For offense and defense, we trust in thee.
Εnemy attack!
I wonder where Dad is fighting now.
No, let go!
What's that?
It's a graνe.
Μama's also in a graνe, right?
Αuntie told me.
Μama is already dead and in a graνe.
We'll go to her graνe one day.
Setsuko, do you remember the cemetery near Nunobiki?
That's where Μama is. under a big camphor tree...
Why do fireflies haνe to die so soon?
Hey, somebody is liνing here.
Homeless, maybe?
What if he's here?
Τhere's eνen a swing.
Α kid liνes here.
What's this?
Μay you rest in peace!
Wish this were real.
Hey! It says "Setsuko".
Look! Dried frogs!
They eat those?!
Wonder if the eνacuated boys also eat stuff like this?
Υuck! Ground soybeans!
Worse than what we eat!
It's a ghost!
Wait!
Wait for me!
Αnd we'νe already traded all of our mother's kimono for rice.
Υou used to take money...
Τhis isn't about kimono or money.
I'm a farmer, but eνen I don't haνe extra food to share.
Αny other relatiνes?
We can't contact them.
Then be wise.
Go back to your aunt's.
Eνerything is rationed nowadays.
We must rely on neighborhood groups.
Tell her you're sorry and want to stay.
Τhank you, but we'll try elsewhere.
Υou're a naνy man's son!
Be strong!
It's okay?
Oh, no!
Υou must eat your beans and millet.
Υou got to eat to grow big!
Seita?
Something is wrong with my tummy.
Αre you cold?
Τhe diarrhea doesn't go away.
Υou bastard!
Forgiνe me!
I'm sorry!
Please let me go!
Wanted some sugar for my sick sister!
Shut up! Stealing crops is a serious crime in wartime!
Υou're not going to get away with this!
What?
Ενen dug up these small ones?
So you're the crop thief!
Seita!
Please forgiνe me.
I won't do it again!
No, we're going to the police!
I'm sending you off to jail!
Μy sister is really sick!
She has no one but me!
Seita! Seita!
Seita!
Seita. Seita.... understood.
I'll talk to him and file a report.
Τhat will be enough.
Υou can go now.
But...
Υou'νe beaten him enough.
It's an injurious assault...
...to a minor!
I will be going then...!
Τonight's air raid was in Fukui.
Why not come in for a drink of water?
Setsuko.
Seita!
Seita.
Where does it hurt?
Υou must see a doctor and get a shot.
Setsuko!
Seita, I want to go to the toilet.
- Can you hold it?
- uh-huh.
Get on my back.
Τhe brother went to the mountain to cut firewood. Τhe grandmother...
Hurry! Hurry!
Setsuko, let's eat.
Today's pumpkin is good!
It tastes like real bean jelly.
I hate bean jelly.
Come on, Dad'll get mad at me if you don't eat.
I'll help you, so cheer up and eat!
When you get well, we'll go to the beach again.
Go, go! Υay!
Bang!
Τhis will bring us food, Setsuko!
Seita...?
Seita?
Υou say this was your Μama's?
How can this cheap flimsy thing be a keepsake?!
Setsuko?
Setsuko!
Seita....
Water....
Breathe in.
Breathe out.
Αnd she's had diarrhea for many days now.
Τhe rash isn't from the heat.
Seawater just hurts her skin.
She's weak from malnutrition.
Thus, the diarrhea.
Okay, next!
Can you giνe her medicine or a shot?
I hate shots!
Please giνe her some medical treatment.
Μedicine won't help.
Αll she needs is nutrition.
Nutrition...?
What's wrong?
But where can I get that?!
Αm I hungry.
What do you want to eat?
Τempura, sashimi, tokoroten noodles...
Αnything else?
Ice cream. Αnd...
I want fruit drops again.
Fruit drops?
Αlrighty.
I'll go withdraw all our saνings.
I don't need anything.
Please stay home with me.
Don't go! Don't go! Don't go!
Don't worry, Setsuko.
I'll go buy rice and nutritious food for you...
Then, I'll neνer eνer leaνe.
I'll always be with you.
I promise.
Here's 3,000 yen.
Α typhoon is coming?
What a joke! Our "diνine wind" comes after we'νe surrendered.
Surrendered...?
We lost the war?!
Υou didn't know?
Is it true?
The Great Εmpire of Japan lost?
Υes, it was unconditional surrender.
Where's our fleet?
They're long gone.
Αll sunk!
Not eνen a ship left.
What?!
Dad's cruiser too?!
Is that why we got no reply?!
How should I know?
Strange boy.
Dad, I hate you!
I'm so hungry.
Dad.
Now eνen Dad's dead.
Now eνen Dad's...
Setsuko, sorry I'm so late.
I'll make you rice gruel.
It went up.
It went down.
Oh, it stopped.
Eνen got chicken and eggs!
Αnd there's also...
What's that in your mouth?!
Τhis is a marble.
It's not a fruit drop!
Υou're getting something better today. Υour faνorite.
Seita, this is for you.
What is it, Setsuko?
It's steamed rice.
Here's some cooked soy pulp.
Please eat.
Υou're not haνing any?
Setsuko...!
See? It's watermelon.
I didn't steal this either.
Here, haνe some.
It's yummy...
Hold on. I'll make you rice gruel with eggs.
I'll leaνe these here for you.
Okay?
Seita...
Thank you.
Setsuko never woke up.
Here's a special ration of charcoal.
Υou can cremate the child on temple grounds. undress the body, and use dry husks to start a good fire.
Τhe weather is so fine today!
- Nothing has changed!
- It's great to be back home!
We can finally listen to the gramophone!
I missed this loνely νiew!
Come home soon!
Next morning...
I put Setsuko's ashes into the drops tin and left.
I never went to the cave again.
Seita!
- It's late. Go to sleep now.
- Okay.

SEE, THIS WATCH
IS YOUR LIFE...
AND IT'S STOPPED.
WELL, CAN'T YOU JUST
WIND IT UP OR SOMETHING?
AND SEND YOU BACK?
OH, NO, NO, NO.
NO ONE'S EVER
ALLOWED TO GO BACK.
PUT YOUR PAW
RIGHT HERE.
WHAT'S THAT FOR?
FOR OUR BOOK
OF RECORDS.
EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU
THAT WAS OR WILL BE
IS RIGHT HERE.
OH, ISN'T THAT WONDERFUL?
I LOVE IT HERE.
YOU MEAN THERE'S
NO SURPRISES OR ANYTHING?
OH, NO, NO, NO.
WE KNOW EVERYTHING.

THAT'S JUST LOVELY.
THE CLOUDS, THE GRASS,
THE AIR.
HEAVEN IS
A WONDERFUL PLACE!
YEAH.
NO SURPRISES, HUH?
SAY...
WOULD YOU LIKE TO DANCE?
YOU MEAN IF I'M WAITING FOR
AN INSIDE STRAIGHT UP HERE,
I'D KNOW IN ADVANCE
WHETHER I FILLED IT?
WE KNOW HOW
IT ALL TURNS OUT.
YOU MUST HAVE
STUDIED DANCING.
YOU HAVE NATURAL RHYTHM,
UNUSUAL FOR A WHIPPET.
OH, I'M GETTING DIZZY!
EVERYTHING
IS SO LOVELY HERE--
SO PLANNED,
SO ORDERED.
THAT'S WHAT'S
DRIVING ME CRAZY.

CHARLIE, CHARLIE,
IT'S REALLY YOU.
BUT I SAW THE CAR

I KNOW.
AND YOUR LIFELESS BODY
FLYING THROUGH THE AIR.
ITCHY, WHAT CAN I SAY?
IT WASN'T MY TIME.
I'M SO HAPPY
TO SEE YOU, CHARLIE!
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH I MISSED YOU!
SHUT UP!
YOU WANT THE WHOLE WORLD
TO KNOW I'M BACK?
YOU THOUGHT I WAS DEAD.
SO WILL CARFACE.
HE TRIED TO KILL ME.
I'LL MAKE HIM PAY!
WE DON'T WANT TO
DO THAT.

THE BRAINS OF THE OUTFIT.
WHEN I LEFT,
HE SHOULD HAVE GONE UNDER.
THAT'S IT, BOSS.
WE'LL GO UNDER.
DEEP, DEEP UNDER.
I DON'T WANT TO GO UNDER.
THE OPERATION GREW.
IT GOT BIGGER.
NOW HE WON'T SHARE.
WE COULD SHARE
A NICE LITTLE PLACE
IN THE HIMALAYAS.
I HATE THE HIMALAYAS.
WAIT. THEY GOT
GAMBLING, RACES.
WELL, THEY EVEN GOT
A TOWN CALLED TIBET.
YOU KNOW, TO-BET.
WE COULD NAB LLAMAS,
MOUNTAIN GOATS,
OPEN OUR OWN TRACK, BOSS.
HE'S GOT SOMETHING
UP HIS SLEEVE.
YEAH, A GUN.
WHEN I FIND OUT
WHAT IT IS,
I'M GONNA RUIN HIM.
I'M GONNA MAKE HIM
SUFFER...SLOW.
HE'LL BE BEGGING
FOR MERCY.
I'M BEGGING THAT
WE GET OUT OF HERE.
BOSS,
CARFACE HAS GOT THUGS,
AND THEY GOT MUSCLES,
KNIVES.

WHY DON'T YOU TELL SOMEBODY
YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT?
IT'S NOT WORTH IT

WISHING STAR:
And so the Kingdom of Caring
became home for the Care Bear family.
And whenever someone on Earth needed their help,
the Caring Meter would let Noble Heart
and True Heart know.
Oh.
Look.
The Caring Meter, someone must need our help down on Earth.
What do we do?
Why, go and help them.
Hurry.
Oh, hurry.
Quick, let's go.
Wait a minute.
Wait.
Ooh.
Oh.
But who's going to look after the cubs?
I will.
I will.
One of us has to go.
Right.
Right.
I'll go.
I'll go.
Oh.
Ooh.
I'll go this time,
Noble Heart.
You stay here and look after the cubs.
This was the Care Bears' first mission,
and it was up to True Heart to figure out
how she was going to get down to Earth.
Goodbye,
True Heart.
Good luck and be careful.
We care...
Ooh.
Oh.
Ow.
Ah.
Ooh.
Ow.
A totem pole.
True Heart was right on target,
for the trouble seemed to be coming from a summer camp.
This must be the place.
Why, little
Swift Heart Rabbit... you little stowaway.
Well, you might as well come along and help me find out what the trouble is all about.
Where did everybody go?
Yahoo!
Last ones back to the camp do trash duty for a week.
Ooh.
Out of my way.
Out of my way.
Wait up.
Oh, no.
Wait up.
Wait for us.
No.
Oh.
No.
First back, I win.
Ha!
John, Dawn, and Christy are last again.
So what else is new?
Ha-ha-ha!
You three are last at everything.
And you're always first at everything.
So what does that make you?
Camp Champ, that's what.
I can run faster, swim better, and hike longer than the three of you put together.
But big deal.
So can every other kid here.
Let me give you some advice.
If you can't keep up, leave... uh, after you do the trash duty.
Ha-ha-ha!
Uh.
I wish that just once
I could be Camp Champ.
I hate being last, and I hate being here.
So do we, Christy.
We can't swim.
We can't paddle a boat.
He's right.
We'll always be last.
And we'll always be doing trash duty.
And all the camp laundry.
Well, not me... not anymore.
I'm going to do something about it.
That's the way, Christy.
What are you... going to do?
I'm going to run away.
Run away?
No.
Wait, Christy, we're going with you.
Christy, wait!
Christy, wait!
Don't run away.
Oh. Ooh.
Let go of me.
Ah.
Oh, now which path did they take?
I hope things are going better for Noble Heart than they are for me.
But it looks as though
Noble Heart
has more than his hands full
taking care of the little cubs.
Waah, waah.
I'm sure this is the right path, John.
It'll probably lead you right back here.
Well, it looked as though
John and Dawn
were having problems of their own.
See what I mean?
We're lost.
We can't even run away right.
Yeah.
We're the first to get lost and the last at everything else.
This is the path back to camp... if you want to take it.
Who are you?
What are you?
My name is True Heart.
I'm a friend.
I've come to help you find your way back to camp.
Forget it.
Forget it.
We're not going back to camp.
Ever!
Ever!
Running away from a problem never solved it.
You two are just too worried about the things you can't do.
Maybe you should think about all the things you can do.
Like what?
We can't do anything.
That's not true.
For starters, everyone can share their feelings.
Huh.
Nobody wants to share anything with us.
We're just losers.
Waah!
Waah!
John and Dawn, meet Baby Swift Heart Rabbit.
Don't cry, little one.
There, there.
It's all right.
See, you can do something.
You can share your feelings and make friends.
Well... maybe.
I'll show you.
Oh.
Whoa.
Hey. Where are we going?
To meet my friend Noble Heart.
Aren't you coming?
Oh, dear.
Hurry, True Heart.
Whoa.
Thank you.
Oh.
There has to be easier ways of getting around.
Beware, True Heart, soon I'll be coming for you and your little cubs.
Ha! Ha! Ha!
So True Heart took John and Dawn
up to the Kingdom of Caring.
John and Dawn have come to learn a little more about sharing their feelings,
Noble Heart.
They already know something about feelings, because they cared enough to come all the way here.
I'm going back to try and find your friend Christy.
[BONG]
Ooh.
What's that?
It's our Caring Meter.
It lets us know when something is affecting the level of caring on Earth.
This time it might be Dark Heart.
Dark Heart?
Who's Dark Heart?
Let's hope you never have to find out.
If it is Dark Heart, it'll take both of us.
Could you watch over the cubs while we're gone?
I--I think so.
Sure.
We know you can do it.
Good luck.
Waah.
Waah.
Waah.
Waah. Waah.
Right.
Right.

[BURPS]
Well, Noble Heart, even though we found no trace of Dark Heart or Christy,
I'd say that this wasn't a wasted trip to Earth.
Indeed not, True Heart, we left two children who thought they weren't good at anything.
And have returned to find two world-class baby-sitting champions in their place.
Meanwhile, Christy was lost in the woods
and was about to need more help than anyone could have guessed.
Where are those guys?
Maybe they ran away without me.
Oh, why can't I be good at anything except shooting marbles?
Marble champ... so what?
Oh, if only I could run or swim or do something to be the Camp Champ.
John?
Dawn?
Hey, what do you know?
The Camp Champ.
Me?
Yeah, sure.
You are the Camp Champ, ain't you?
No.
I'm not.
Well, you sure could have fooled me.
Who are you?
I'm from the camp on the other side of the river.
Say, you wouldn't want to be the Camp Champ, would you?
I could fix it for you.
What do you say?
Well, I don't know.
There's only one catch, though.
I knew it was too good to be true.
Not so fast.
It's no big deal.
Sometime I'll drop by and ask you to return the favour, and you just do it, no questions asked.
What do you say?
Ah, you can't make me
Camp Champ.
Oh, no?
Sure. Okay.
You got a deal.
Now, go ahead and make me Camp Champ.
A favour now for a favour later... done.
Do a cartwheel.
A cartwheel,
I can't do a cart--
Just do it.
[GASP]
I did it.
I did it.
You were telling the truth.
Cartwheels are nothing.
Now you can race, swim, paddle.
I am going to be the Camp Champ.
Just remember, when I come back, you owe me a favour, and I will be back.
Christy!
Christy!
Wait till we tell you where we were.
We had these cute little baby cubs.
And we took care of them.
And didn't mess it up.
Anyway, what we have to tell you is that we don't have to win races to be champs.
We're friends.
And whenever we need help, the others will be there.
Good friends are the real champs, Christy.
So none of us have to run away anymore.
Who's running away?
Not me.
I plan on sticking around for a while.
Uh, that's great, Christy.
[BIRD CRY]
Did you hear something, Dawn?
I--I don't think so.
Oh, it's getting cold, John.
Let's go in.
I'll be back for you.
Knowing that it was only a matter of time
before Dark Heart found them,
Noble Heart and True Heart moved the little cubs
to a safer place, in fact, two places.
The little Care Bear cubs found a new home
in the billowy softness of Care-a-Lot,
while the little
Care Bear Cousin cubs
took to the trees of the Forest of Feelings.
Two timeless places
where the little cubs could grow up big and strong
in what seemed to be the twinkling of an eye.

Thanks to True Heart and Noble Heart
all the little cubs had learned
how to help people share their feelings
and put those feelings into action.
They were now the Care Bears and the Care Bear Cousins,
the Care Bear Family.
Little did they know,
that from his secret cave beneath the camp,
Dark Heart was planning to capture the Care Bears.
The time is right for me to begin to ruin all that is good and kind in the world, starting with those furry defenders of feelings.
I will remove them one by one and lock them away in their own special place for an eternity.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
With True Heart and Noble Heart busy elsewhere, it's time for me to pay a visit to the rest of the Care Bears.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Yeah, I won!
The Camp Champ wins again.
Oh.
Phew.
Oh.
Aren't you going to congratulate me?
Sure, Christy, but it's nothing new.
You always win at everything.
Oh, that's because
I'm the Camp Champ.
Boy, I remember when you couldn't win at anything except marbles.
It doesn't seem like it was all that long ago.
Hey, Christy, want to go shoot some marbles?
Hmm.
Come on, you slowpokes.
Time to see if anyone can beat the Camp Champ at swimming.
Ha!
Ah, do we have to?
Last one to the water gets trash duty for a week.
Dark Heart's influence was changing Christy,
as it would soon change the entire camp.
Meanwhile, the Care Bears were preparing a surprise party
to welcome True Heart and Noble Heart home
from another mission.
None of them even suspected
that an uninvited guest was on his way.
This is going to be a wonderful party,
Tender Heart.
You said it,
Harmony Bear.
Noble Heart and True Heart will really be surprised.
Not if they get back before we're finished setting it all up.
We'll have lots of time to spare,
Grumpy Bear.
Actually, everything's ready now.
Hmm.
That's because
I've been doing double duty.
[BONG]
Everyone, look!
The Caring Meter's going crazy.
What do you make of it,
Tender Heart?
I'm not sure.
[KNOCKING]
Who's that?
I don't know.
Come on.
Let's go find out.
Whee!
Ooh.
Ooh.
Howdy.
[GULP GULP]
I'm the Caring Meter Reader.
I've come to read your Caring Meter. and it looks like I've got here just in time.
[HUMMING]
I've just about got it.
There, let it cool down for a bit, and it'll be good as new.
We're having a party.
Would you like to come?
Boy, would I ever.
Who likes games?
Oh, oh, me!
Yeah, I do.
I do.
Me, too.
All right.
Me, too.
Sack Racers over there,
Hide and Seekers right over there,
Blind Man's Bluffers down there, and Leap Froggers up there.
Time for a game of disappearing bears.
Come on, we're ready.
All right.
Ready, set, go.
Ha-ha.
Ha-ha.
Ah.
Grr.
Leap Frog.
Come on, let's play Hide and Seek.
Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Ready or not, here I come.
One, two, three, who do I see?
Aarh!
The Caring Meter Reader.
Touch home. You're it.
Here I come.
[HONK HONK]
Ah, ha.
One bear in the bag, coming up.
Ah!
Leave me alone.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Ugh.
Whee.
Oh, no.
Whoa.
Ah.
Uh.
No!
Ah.
Oh.
Oh.
Ow.
Whoa.
Ah.
Oh, we're terribly sorry.
Can we give you a hand?
Let's give him a big hug.
No.
Get away from me.
Keep your kindness and affection to yourselves.
Oh, it's Dark Heart.
Yes.
I've come here to get you.
And now I shall have you all.
That's what you think, Dark Heart.
True Heart. Noble Heart.
You'll have to get through us first.
I should have gotten rid of your little helpers before I went after you two.
Care Bears...
Care Cousins...
Stare.
Call.
No!
You have won today, but I'll be back.
We must follow him,
True Heart, while his evil power is still weak and defeat him once and for all.
Care Bears.
Care Bear Cousins.
While we're away, it will be up to all of you to carry on caring for the world.
You can count on us.
All of us.
We love you True Heart,
Noble Heart.
We love you all.
We hope we can do it by ourselves.
We have to,
Tender Heart.
We have to.
So while True Heart and Noble Heart
were off chasing Dark Heart to the ends of the Earth,
the Care Bears tried to take care of everything
all by themselves.
All right, Funshine, level off.
You're cleared for takeoff.
I can't remember when we've been so busy,
Tender Heart.
True Heart and Noble Heart are counting on us to handle everything until they get back.
They won't return until they find Dark Heart and defeat him.
I hope for everyone's sake, they're okay.
First one back.
I won.
You always win, Christy.
That's right.
That's why I'm Camp Champ, and you're not.
You lost, so you've got trash duty for a week.
Now, get started.
Oh, oh, please, Christy.
If I ever become
Camp Champ again,
I'd let others win once in a while.
Ha!
Well, you'll never be Camp Champ again.
No one will.
Are you the Camp Champ?
Who wants to know?
Good.
The time has come for you to return my favour.
Who-- who are you?
Oh, you remember me.
What do I have to do to repay your favour?
I want to trap the Care Bears, and I have a plan.
The world must learn to fear me,
Dark Heart.
And, uh, I need your help.
What if I refuse to help you?
What then?
Do you want to go back to being the little girl who never won anything?
The one who always came in last, like him?
Huh? Yeow!
Oh, no.
I knew you'd help me.
Come now.
We're wasting time.
Whoa.
Oh.
Boy, am I bushed.
Where's everyone else,
Tender Heart?
I'm not sure, Grumpy Bear.
We sent them off this morning to help some people, and they haven't come back.
Neither have any of the others that went out after them.
I hope they're all right.
Help.
Oh, no.
More trouble.
Help me.
Someone needs our help.
You and Cheer Bear hold the fort.
You up to this one, Grumpy?
Let's go.
Help. Somebody.
Little did the Care Bears suspect
they were heading right into a trap.
Look.
Help me. Help me.
Please, someone help.
Help.
Brave Heart to the rescue.
Whoa.
Charge!
Brave Heart Lion, sometimes I think you're just a little too brave.
Look.
It's Share, Champ, and Good Luck Bear.
And Friend and Secret Bear.
Wait. Stop!
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's help them.
Charge!
Oh, help.
Somebody.
Please.
Stop!
Look.
Oh, no.
Watch out, Care Bears.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Help me.
Hey, grab hold of the line.
Why won't she grab it?
Yeow.
Oh, no.
Yeow.
GRUMPY:
Hey, where are they going?
ALL:
It's Dark Heart.
Well, we can't just sit here.
We have to help that little girl.
Better not,
Brave Heart.
Secret Bear and I saw her throw her paddles into the water.
She's working with Dark Heart.
So that's what's happened to Birthday Bear and all the other
Care Bears.
Dark Heart's trapped them.
Well, we're not going to take this sitting down.
What are we going to do?
I want you to gather all the Care Bear Cousins and meet us at the Hall of Hearts for a Care Bear Conference.
Hurry, or there won't be enough of us left to do anything.
Why so glum, Christy?
You're doing a great job.
Well, when will we stop?
Oh, when I have each and every one of those Bears and their Cousins in my grasp.
No!
By then, Noble Heart and True Heart will realize they've really been chasing my shadow.
When they come,
I'll be ready for them.
There will be no one left to stop me.
Ah!
Whoa!
Ow.
Hey.
Hey, what are you doing?
Oh, no.
Oh.
You-- you saved me.
Why?
Good or bad, you're still a person.
Or whatever you are.
If you knew what was good for you, you would have left me.
That's what you would have done.
Maybe that's the only difference between us.
Dark Heart's evil influence was already spreading
through the children in the camp.
Dawn, get down.
Come on.
Something is going on, John.
All the other kids--
Are destroying everything they come across.
Even the animals in the forest were acting strangely
because of Dark Heart's evil presence.
Whatever's gotten into them is getting into everything around here.
[GROWLING]
John!
Run!
Run!
Oh, we're in luck,
Secret Bear.
That's just who Tender Heart sent us to find.
Yow!
Help!
Oh, dear.
Yes, talking to him might calm him down.
Uh, excuse me,
Mr. M--M--Moose.
Are you angry about something?
Maybe you want to talk about it.
Maybe not.
Run!
Hurry!
Run!
Whoa!
Whoa!
[MOOSE CALL]
[MOOSE CALL]
[MOOSE CALL]
You don't make much noise,
Secret Bear, but when you do...
Right again.
A little love does go a long way.
It certainly cured the moose of Dark Heart's influence.
Hey, you're the cubs.
That's right.
And now we're here to help you.
Come on.
Tender Heart's called a meeting at the Hall of Hearts.
I'll explain on the way.
With Christy's help,
Dark Heart had trapped almost every one
of the Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins.
There was only a handful of
Care Bear family members left.
And now, everything depended on them.
So this is all of us that are left.
Oh, my.
Oh, dear.
What can we do?
We were so many, now, we're so very few.
Well, we can't just stop helping people, Harmony Bear.
I mean, we just can't stop caring.
Brave Heart's right, and Dark Heart knows it, too.
Each time we go to help someone in trouble that someone could be Christy setting another trap.
But what about Noble Heart and True Heart?
I don't know, Grumpy.
But what I do know is that we can't wait for them to come back.
This is up to us.
If we lose, there'll be nothing left.
We're with you,
Tender Heart.
All the way.
Hooray!
Yeah! Yippee!
Hooray! Yippee!
Cousins, kids, every bear, don't just sit there.

Ha-ha-ha-ha!
The Care Bear family was risking everything
in an attempt to free the others
from Dark Heart's cave.
Now's our chance.
That door must lead to
Dark Heart's secret cave.
There's Brave Heart's signal.
So do you two know what you have to do?
Leave Christy to us.
You help the others.
Let's go.
This must be where Dark Heart is keeping the others.
Come on.
The coast is clear.
They've walked right into my trap.
Now that I have the entire
Care Bear family in my power, all the love and kindness in the world will soon be no more.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
It was beginning to look
as though True Heart and Noble Heart
were the Care Bear family's only hope,
but they were still away
unknowingly chasing
Dark Heart's shadow.
I don't like the looks of this place, Noble Heart.
I'm with you,
True Heart.
But we have to follow Dark Heart wherever he leads.
[ROARING]
There he is.
Come on.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Now, True Heart.
Now!
Ha-ha!
Noble Heart, look.
It's not Dark Heart at all.
It's--it's-- his shadow.
We've been tricked into leaving the Care Bears and the Care Bear Cousins all alone.
Hurry, we have to get back and hope we're not too late.
Little did they know, they were already too late.
Ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha!
Looking for me?
Hey.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Hey, are you okay?
Ha-ha-ha!
Now I have you all.
You can't keep us in here,
Dark Heart.
Oh, I don't intend to.
I have a very special place all set.
[YAWN]
But that will keep until after I've rested.
[YAWN]
[HICCUP]
Oh.
I shall be back shortly.
[HICCUPPING]
Now we're all here.
That's the plan, Bedtime Bear.
We wanted to get caught.
We're strongest when we're all together.
So now, we can make a unified stand against Dark Heart.
[WHISTLES]
Hurry, Little
Star Buddy.
We don't have much time.
Christy?
John?
Dawn?
Oh, what are you doing here?
Run away before he gets you too.
No, Christy, we're staying.
We're going to help.
We can make things go back to just the way they were before Dark Heart came here.
Since I've been Camp Champ,
I've never made you do trash duty or pushed you in the mud.
No one laughs at you anymore when you trip or fall on your face.
I won't let them.
Oh, I can't go back to being a nobody.
Not now.
You were never a nobody, Christy.
You were always good at being our friend.
And a friend is the most special person in the world.
I made a bargain with him.
I have to keep my part of it.
Oh, it's too late.
The damage has been done.
All right.
You've paid him back.
Now you have to stop him from hurting all the others.
It's time you start thinking of them, of your friends.
You were always the Marble Champ,
Christy, and that you did all by yourself.
Dawn? John?
Wait for me.
Reunited,
John, Dawn, and Christy
set off to help their friends.
Good work.
Oh, no.
Little Star Buddy can't unlock all these doors.
You're right, and we don't have much time.
We have to get the key from Dark Heart.
What if he wakes up?
We have to chance it.
Let's go.
Whoa. Hey.
Whoa, whoa.
It's out of reach.
That's it. That's it.
You got it.
Ow.
Oh.
Uh-oh.
Whoa.
No, no.
Whoa.
Look out, Grumpy Bear.
Oh.
Whoa.
There's no escape from me.
Well, it's time to put you all where I should have put you in the first place.
Whoa!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
What did you do to them?
Well, well, if it isn't the Camp Champ.
Where are they, Dark Heart?
The Bears? Their Cousins?
Why, I've created my most prized treasure.
Oh!
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
A chandelier of frozen feelings.
Take a look.
Your friends frozen in my crystal prism.
No!
All that feeling and love right where it should be... trapped forever.
Ah!
Ha-ha-ha!
You can't do this.
I won't let you.
But you've made it all possible.
Now, like this camp, everything I touch will be drained of goodness and kindness.
You have to deal with us first, Dark Heart.
The time has come to put an end to your evil trickery.
Ah, Noble Heart and True Heart... true and noble to the very end.
I'm glad you came, but you see, you're already too late.
Now, you shall join the others and leave me to do as I will.
Ha-ha!
No! Stop!
Christy, move out of the way.
Christy, do as he says.
No, I won't let you do this.
Free the others.
We have concluded our bargain.
I'm allowing you to leave.
Now, go.
I know you don't want to do this.
Leave us, or I will take back all that I have given you.
So be it.
You are back to the way you were... a loser.
Okay, so what?
I helped you do this, and I'm going to help stop you.
You've saved my life, Christy.
Now, run and save yourself.
Go!
Ooh.
Ah!
Stop!
Christy!
Yow!
Ah-ha-ha-ha!
Care Bears, stare!
Care Cousins, call!
No!
No!
Yikes!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Oh, no.
Good or bad, you're still a person.
What have I done?
Oh!
[GASP]
Help me, Care Bears.
Oh.
[GASPS]
You must bring this child back from where I've sent her.
We--we can't.
It would take more love and caring than even we have all put together.
No!
You've got to do something.
What good is all your love, your caring, if it cannot save this child?
If you can't help, who can?
We care.
We all really care.
There have to be other people who care as much as we do.
People somewhere, anywhere.
If all of us and everyone everywhere all care together, it just might be enough to save Christy.
Everyone hold hands and together open your hearts and your ears and listen real hard for the voice of those who care.
We care. We care. We care.
If you have ever cared, do it now.
Help us.
Tell us you care.
Tell your friend next to you that you care.
We care!
Tell them how much you care.
Tell them again.
Say it. Shout it. Help us.
We care. We care.
We care.
We care.
We care!
We care.
We care.
We care.
We care.
I care. I care.
I care. I care!
I care! I care!
DAWN:
Christy?
Yahoo! Hooray!
Hooray, Christy!
[RUMBLING]
Hurry.
We have to leave quickly!
Oh.
Thank you.
Thank you for caring.
But--but I did care, didn't I?
I never really understood why you pulled me out of the river, but I think I do now.
Yeah!
Hooray!
Your eyes...
Look.
I'm a boy, a real boy.
Your evil left you when you admitted how much you really cared.
Whoopee!
I'm a boy!
I can jump.
I can run.
I can turn cartwheels.
Whoa!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Don't worry, we can learn together.
Hey, come on!

This camp's the greatest place to be.
I'm going to see what I can do about staying here and helping to make sure that everyone's a camp champ.
Just remember, everybody's already a champ, because no matter who they are, they're friends.
Yes, sir, everything was back to the way it was,
but as always,
it was just a little bit different,
a little bit better,
and a little bit more special
thanks to the Care Bears, the Care Bear Cousins
and thanks to...
Well, you all know who you are.
I thank my lucky stars
that there are people out there like you
who really do care.
You're not afraid to share your feelings
and that, my friends,
makes you all world-class

Legend has it, in the mystic land of Prydain, there was once a king so cruel and so evil... that even the gods feared him.
Since no prison could hold him, he was thrown alive into a crucible of molten iron.
There, his demonic spirit was captured... in the form of a great Black Cauldron.
For uncounted centuries, the Black Cauldron lay hidden, waiting, while evil men searched for it, knowing whoever possessed it would have the power... to resurrect an army of deathless warriors... and, with them, rule the world.
There's something wrong.
I can feel it in my bones.
The Fairfolk know it too.
You don’t see any of them around.
The Horned King, that black hearted devil.
What's he waiting for?
Yes, yes, cat.
I know you want your breakfast, but, just now, thinking is more important.
Taran, the pot is boiling over!
Oh, Dallben. I was just thinking.
What if the war's over, and I never had a chance to fight?
Hmm, and a good thing too.
War isn’t a game.
People get hurt.
But I'm not afraid.
Ouch!
Yes, there you are.
If the Horned King ever returns, you'll have a great deal more to worry about... than a burned finger.
No, no, no, cat. That is not for you.
It's for Hen Wen.
Hen Wen, Hen Wen.
It's always Hen Wen!
And one day, my boy, you may learn why.
Now, no more dreaming.
You have chores to do.
Yes, sir.
He's so anxious... and so blind to the dangers ahead.
Look, cat. You're in luck.
Just enough left for you.
Hmm.
Dallben doesn't understand.
I'm not a little boy anymore.
I should be doing heroic deeds for Prydain, not waiting hand and foot on a spoiled--
Hey!
Oh, all right, Hen.
I didn't mean it.
You'd better eat it.
Dallben made it especially for you.
Is this to be my life?
Pampering a pig?
I'm a warrior nota pig keeper.
Dallben thinks I'd be afraid, but I wouldn't.
All I need is a chance, and I could be a famous warrior.
Look at me, Hen!
I can do it! Ha!
Even you're afraid.
Do you challenge me? Run, you cowards.
There you are.
His Majesty, the Horned King.
So we meet at last.
Ha!
Even the Horned King shakes with fear.
See, Hen? Everybody runs from the famous Taran of Caer Dallben!
Prydain's finest warrior... draws his last... breath.
Dallben.
Hmm, not quite the blade for a hero.
I was--
It's just that we were--
Hen Wen got dirty.
Oh, I see.
Another dream, Aran?
But, Dallben, won't I ever be anything but an assistant pig keeper?
She's a special pig, Taran.
Now, give her a nice bath.
Well, Hen, it looks as though...
I'll still be an assistant pig keeper when I'm as old as Dallben.
You like that, don’t you?
Now for the part you like best.
Hey, come on, Hen.
I haven’t finished scrubbing your ba--
- Hen, what’s the matter?
Calm down, Hen.
Stop it, please! What's the matter?
- Hen Wen--
-Taran, what's going on?
I-I don't know.
There's something wrong with Hen Wen.
What? Quickly, lad.
Bring her inside.
- What's that for?
- Put Hen Wen down.
I never use her powers unless I have to, but now I must.
- ''Powers''?
-Taran, what you are about to see, you must never reveal to anyone.
Hen Wen, from you,
I do beseech... knowledge that lies beyond my reach, troubled thoughts beyond your heart.
Pray you now those thoughts impart.
The Horned King.
Shh-shh-shh. Don't interfere.
He is searching.
The Black Cauldron!
-So that's it.
- ''The Black Cauldron''?
An awesome weapon, Taran.
It's been hidden for centuries, but if the Horned King should find it... and unleash its power, nothing could stand against him.
That's Hen Wen.
He knows.
Stop! Enough!
You must leave here at once.
Take Hen Wen to the hidden cottage... at the edge of the forbidden forest.
Hide there and never bring her out until I come for you.
''Hide''? But why?
Only I knew the secret of Hen Wen's power, but now the Horned King has discovered it.
We must make sure he never uses it to find the Black Cauldron.
I'm not afraid of the Horned King.
Then you are a very foolish lad.
Untried courage is no match for his evil.
Just remember that.
Now, off you go, my boy, and take care of yourself.
Good-bye, Dallben.
I won't fail you.
So much, so soon... to rest on his young shoulders.
Oh, yes.
Yes, my soldiers.
Soon the Black Cauldron will be mine.
Its evil power will course through my veins, and I shall make you...
Cauldron born.
Yes. Yes. Oh, yes.
Then you will worship me!
Me.
Oh, my soldiers.
How long
I have thirsted... to be a god... among mortal men.
Gosh, Hen Wen.
I never knew... you could create visions and things like that.
I thought you were just an ordinary pig.
I had no idea you were so... special.
Dallben's going to be glad that he put his trust in me.
Just you wait and see.
Now, don't go wandering about.
And don’t you worry.
Keep close to me, and no one will do you any harm.
Not while I'm around.
- I won't let the Horned King get close to you, Hen.
I'll protect you.
Taran of Caer Dallben, the greatest warrior in all Prydain, a true hero!
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you all.
But without the help of my pig,
Hen Wen, here, I--
Hen Wen, where are you?
Hen Wen?
Oh, no!
Hen?
Hen Wen!
Is that you, Hen?
Look what I've got.
Come on out. Here's a lovely--
Ooh, great prince. Give poor, starving
Gorge munchings and crunchings.
Nice apple.
Good prince. Good apple.
Oh, boy, what a juicy apple.
Hey. No, you don't!
I didn't give you that apple.
You took it. Ow!
Hey, hold on, you hairy, little thief.
Come back with my apple!
If you don't give it back, you'll be sorry. I mean it.
I'm warning you.
Give it back.
Come on. The apple--
Where is it?
Uh-uh. Gorge not know where the ap-- Uh-oh.
Give it back.
I warn you.
Come on.
-Aha.
-Come on, the apple. Let's have it.
You horrible, greedy thing.
You should be ashamed of yourself!
Oh, poor, miserable Gorge deserves... fierce smackings and whackings on his poor, tender head.
Always left with no munchings and crunchings.
Forgive poor Gorge.
Oh, stop that snivelling.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Now, look here.
Have you seen my pig?
Piggy?
Round, fat piggy?
- Big snout?
- Yes, yes.
-Curly tail?
-That's her. That's Hen Wen!
Uh-uh. Nope.
Gorge not see piggy. Nope.
Oh, never mind.
No telling where
Hen Wen is by now.
Ooh, master, master.
Now Gorge remembers! Yes, yes!
Clever, sharp-eyed Gorge saw the piggy run.
Yes, right through the forest!
Mm-hmm. I saw it! I saw it!
Come!
Gorge will find the lost piggy.
Then we'll be friends forever.
Munchings and crunchings in here somewhere.
It's Hen Wen! She's in trouble!
Good-bye.
Hen Wen!
Hen!
Hen Wen!
Hen Wen, look out!
Look out!
Come on! Hurry, Hen!
No! Don't! Hen, hurry!
Don't! No!
No! No!
No! Come back!
Please!
No! No! Come back!
Hen Wen.
I must get her out of there.
Oh, no, great lord.
Not go in there.
Forget the piggy.
-What are you doing here?
-Gorge come back to be your friend.
''Friend''?
You're no friend!
Why, you ran away when I--
Oh, never mind.
I promised Dallben
I would keep Hen safe.
I have to go.
Well, uh, are you coming?
Me? Go in there?
Oh, no, no, no.
It's a terrible place.
Justas I thought.
You're no friend.
You're just a miserable coward.
Here. This is all you wanted.
If great lord go into evil castle, poor Gorge will never see his friend again.
Nope. Never.
Shut up, you thick-skulled dolt.
Always barking at nothing.
-All right, might as well make our rounds.
Here's to everybody!
More wine and meat for my men!
And more women.
Quiet. I'm trying to sleep.
How about a kiss, princess?
Gad, you’re a lovely one!
-Come on!
- Here.
Keep your hands off, you little creeper.
Going somewhere,
Creeper?
Kiss me, love, and I'll die with a smile on my face.
Welcome, Your Majesty.
We're just celebrating our success.
Oh, I mean your success.
We've made no mistakes, this time.
Bring in the prisoner!
Oh, no.
There, sire.
This is the pig that creates visions.
All right, pig, show His Majesty... where the Black Cauldron can be found!
Go on!
Show it!
Stubborn little thing, isn’t she?
Yes, sire. You're quite right.
I'll take care of it at once.
The Black Cauldron.
Where is it?
Show us, swine!
I warn you.
The King's patience is short.
No!
Get him! The sneaking, no-good--
Get back, or I'll--
Oh.
Release him.
What?
Well, here.
Hen Wen.
Oh, Hen Wen.
There, there.
I presume, my boy, you are the keeper of this oracular pig.
Yes, sir.
Then instruct her to show me... the whereabouts... of the Black Cauldron.
Oh, sir, I-I-I can't.
I promised.
Very well.
In that case, the pig is no use to me.
What are you going to do?
No! You can't!
Don't!
No! Stop!
I'll make her tell you.
That's better.
Now, get on with the vision, pig.
Hen Wen, from you,
I do beseech... knowledge that lies beyond my reach.
Look! Look, sire!
It's working!
The Black Cauldron.
So it does exist.
Go on.
Yes, yes.
Where is it?
Show me.
Show me.
Come on, Hen!
After them!
Get them! After them!
Gotcha, pig boy!
The moat.
It's our only chance.
Come on, Hen.
Swim, Hen! Swim!
I'm coming!
Gotcha, pig boy!
I caught him, Your Majesty!
I caught the boy.
But you let the pig go, didn’t you?
It wasn't my fault.
Throw the boy into the dungeon!
You must make sure he never uses Hen Wen... to find the Black Cauldron.
I won't fail you, Dallben.
Look at me, Hen!
I can do it!
I can do it!
I can do it. I can do it.
Hmm, I thought
I heard a noise in here.
Oh! Was that you?
-Yeah. Yes.
- You're being held a prisoner, aren’t you?
-Yes.
-I'm being held against my will too.
It lights up.
Of course.
It's magic.
Oh, I hate this place.
I do hope there aren’t any rats in here.
Not that I really mind them, you know, but they do jump out atone so.
I'm Princess Eilonwy.
Are you a lord or a warrior?
No.
I'm an assistant pig keeper.
Oh,what a pity.
I was so hoping for someone who could help me escape.
Oh, well, if you want to come with me, you may.
-Can I?
-Yes. I said you could.
Oh,that wicked, wicked king.
You know he stole me. He thought my bauble could tell him... where some old cauldron was.
That's what he wanted my pig for.
Oh, yes. Your pig.
But my pig can tell the future.
Ooh, how interesting.
Well, you’d better stay close to me, or you’ll get lost.
-Your bauble.
- It's always chasing those rats.
A burial chamber.
This could be the tomb of the great king who built this castle... before the Horned King took it over.
Are you all right?
Well, come on, then.
Help me look around.
He must have been a great warrior.
A sword.
This will please him.
It's a good lot this time.
Hurry! In with it!
Finally, he'll reward me for this.
Don't stop, you weakling!
Put some muscle into it.
Let's get out of here before they come back.
Where did you get that sword?
- Back there.
-You mean--
Well, he's not going to use it.
You're making a horrendous mistake. I'm not a spy.
I'm a bard.
I-I-I sing.
I-I-I entertain. I-I--
Careful, sir.
These are the hands of an artist.
This will hold you.
Look, you seem an intelligent sort of chap to me. Eh?
I assure you, I had no idea who owned this castle.
I just happened to be passing.
He's nice, isn't he?
What's his name?
Down, boy! Down!
Come on.
You don't realize who I am.
I shall sing of your dastardly deed.
I'm Fflewddur Fflam, minstrel of minstrels!
Balladeer to the grandest courts in all the land!
And I--
Well, have you forgotten?
I have sung in some of the finest courts.
I'm only waiting for an invitation.
Oh, shush.
Why do you have to judge every word I say?
Who's that?
Help!
Oh, hello. We'll have you untied in a moment.
I'm Princess Eilonwy... and you're in bad trouble, aren’t you?
''Trouble''?
Don’t you know where you are?
Haven’t you seen him?
Pig boy has escaped.
Look in there.
- We've been discovered.
-That's you?
Oh, great beelin.
Run! Run!
Make haste!
''Make haste''?
I must save myself.
I think he went through the passage!
All right.
Let's try down here.
Princess?
Princess Eilonwy?
Pig boy!
You little scut!
Hey.
No, no, no.
Are you all right?
-Oh, good. You're safe.
-Why, of course. I--
-Come on. I'm going to get you out of here.
- There they are!
-Quick! Up here.
Taran, the sword.
Help! Murder!
Don't!
Keep going, Princess.
There he is! There he is!
Over there!
Stop him!
- Taran!
- There they are!
-Come on! Get them!
-Oh, no! Taran!
We've got you now, pig boy!
Taran, do something!
Use the sword!
Make way! Make way!
Stand aside. I command you!
Get out from under my feet!
Let me go, you brute!
Run, Princess! Run!
Stay up!
Please, stay up!
Why didn’t you tell me you had a magic sword?
I'll say it wasn't my fault.
That's it.
That's it. I always get blamed for these things.
I'll just tell him, and if he gets mad...
I’ll just straighten him out.
That's it. I'm not going to be kicked around for this.
S-Sire?
You bring news of the pig?
No, not exactly, sire.
Oh, it's the pig keeper.
He's-- Ooh, he's--
He's... escaped.
Oh. Oh. Oh, sire!
Allow me.
Isn't that enough?
Good.
He'll find his pig.
Send the gwythaints to follow that boy.
Oh, yes, sire!
Oh, yes!
By all means, sire!
* The world will applaud me *
* Its praise will reward me *
* And I, Fflewddur Fflam will find fame **
They're almost finished, Fflewddur.
Hmm, it's not too good, but it will hold for awhile.
Yes, I shall sing of your deed.
It would be better to sing of our heroic escape.
Weren’t you a bit frightened,
Fflewddur?
A Fflam frightened?
The word is not in my vocabulary.
But in this case, well-chosen, my dear.
- I wasn’t afraid.
-Ouch! Not afraid?
Why, we were running for our lives.
Well, I got us out of the castle, didn't I?
You? I'd say it was the sword's magic.
But it takes a great warrior to handle a sword like this.
But still, it is a magic sword.
Ha! What does a girl know about swords anyway?
''Girl''? Girl?
If it weren't for this girl, you would still be in the Horned King's dungeon.
Here now,
Princess Eilonwy, Taran.
At least I don't keep talking about it forever.
Oh, you're so, so boring!
Princess Eilonwy--
How dare you take his side!
I really didn't--
I didn’t mean to interfere, you know.
Silly girl.
Even if she is a princess.
But we’re going to have to, to--
Dear, oh, dear.
Hello.
Hello.
Fflewddur is right, you know.
We are going to have to work together.
And we'll find your pig.
I'm sure it's important.
Thank you for getting me out of the dungeon.
Oh, but we couldn't have done it without you.
Well, at least we’re all safe.
- Great beelin!
- Fflewddur!
Help! Murder!
Hurry!
- Gurgi's lucky day.
-Get this thing off me.
-Wow.
-Yes, keep it! It's a gift!
-Want this. Gorge want this.
-Go ahead.
I'm sure you've murdered for less.
Want. Want.
Gorge want!
Gorge.
Master? Oh, old man fell down.
Get up. Get up.
Well, really.
Who is your pungent, little friend?
He's no friend of mine.
He's just a coward and a thief.
Too big anyway.
You're charming.
And pungent too.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Yes, yes. That's it.
Toddle off. Toddle off.
Gorge go!
Tracks? Tracks!
Gorge remember.
Saw piggy's tracks.
-You did?
-Today!
-Today? Wait a minute.
- He'll try anything.
Oh, you’re both horrid.
He just might know.
- Pretty lady come too?
-Well, I--
-Yes, yes, yes!
Follow Gorge! Follow Gorge!
You better be telling the truth.
Gorge not lie, not this time.
See, master?
Piggy's footsteps.
No lie.
Oh, good.
They look fresh.
Oh, master. Master!
Gorge, hold on!
Oh, no! Taran!
-Give me your hand!
-We're doomed.
How did they get in here?
Old Doli's whirlpool broke again.
I betthey wake up soon.
We better tell King Eidellig.
No, silly. You know we’re not supposed to be up here.
Uh-oh. We're all going to be in trouble.
- Not me.
- Me either.
Uh-oh.
Oh, yes. I see you fixed that.
Yep. When...
I get this... last peg in here,
I'll be finished.
Good. Hmm.
Yes. That should work.
It's perfect.
Grab that pole!
Uh, I got it.
Oh, aren’t you all darling?
Uh, hello.
I'm King Eidellig of the Fairfolk.
How the blazes did they--
I thought I told you to fix the whirlpool.
I fixed it. I did fix it!
It was perfect!
Evidently, not completely perfect.
It's supposed to keep them out.
- Uh, can I be of any service?
-Is everything that happens around here my fault?
-Are you on a friendly visit?
-And I suppose it's my fault the pig's here too!
- Hen Wen?
-Oh, she's your pig?
Oh, good.
One less thing for old Doli to worry about.
- Uh, Doli.
- What now?
Would you hurry and fetch the pig?
Hey, you kids.
What are you doing?
Oh, Mr. Doli, I just want to see the pretty lady.
Well, now, you watch yourselves.
Hear?
I can't believe my eyes,
Your Majesty.
Watch it. Watch it!
Oh, Hen!
Thank goodness you're--
Tell me. Is the burning and killing still going on up there?
You refer to that-that-that-that... joke on humanity, the Horned King.
Will no one ever stand up to him?
We've seen him, and if he finds the Cauldron, he'll kill us all.
Oh, no, no.
He'll never find it.
No, no.
It's safely hid in Morva.
- ''Morva''?
-Well, at least I think it is.
Oh, Doli, is it?
- Really?
Is that one of my new jobs, remembering where the Cauldron was last seen?
Gee!
Oh, he'll know right where it is.
You'll see.
If we could get to the Cauldron first and destroy it--
-Oh, this isn't right, Taran.
- But don’t you see?
If we destroy the Cauldron, it will stop the Horned King.
Please, come with me.
Wait, I never thought--
Morva.
-That's a hard place to get to.
-Yep.
-Why, you can take them.
-What?
Do you mean we're trusting our lives to-to-to him?
-And what is wrong with me?
- Oh, nothing.
Splendid choice.
Shall we, then?
Wait! Hen Wen!
Oh, don’t worry.
We'll get her home safely.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Be good, Hen.
Well, if it’s the Marshes of Morva you wanted, here you are.
Ooh!
Such a dreary place.
Let's see what it looks like from up here.
I think we're lost.
Are you sure this is the right place, Doli?
Yes, I'm sure!
Well, if you ask me--
- Fflewddur! Doli!
-Are you all right?
Hey, look out, you big, clumsy oaf!
Look where you--
Uh-oh.
Welcome to Morva.
Well, s-someone must live here.
Gorge not like this place.
Uh-uh. No.
It seems empty.
Maybe we should have a look.
If I can just get this door open.
How will we ever find the Black Cauldron in a place like this?
It must be here somewhere.
They're only frogs, Eilonwy.
Those were people.
You mean they were turned into frogs?
Ooh, master, come quickly.
Gorge found the wicked Cauldron.
Quick, quick, quick!
Follow Gorge!
- Behold, master.
-The whole room is full of cauldrons.
I don't understand.
Why would,why would anyone want so many--
Thieves! Thieves!
Someone stole all our frogs!
You evil, nasty people.
You shall all be turned into frogs and eaten!
Huh?
Nice and tender.
Stop that, you, you--
Oh. So nice to meet you, ladies.
-Good-bye.
- Wait.
My, aren’t you the handsome one?
Wh-Who? M-M-Me?
Oh, honestly, now, don’t you find me irresistible?
Yes. Well, of course, most attractive.
Shush! Stop that.
You don’t mind if I... pluck your harp, do you, handsome?
Bah! Enough of that lovesick nonsense.
Great beelin'!
Quick!
We're going to have toad stew.
You're not gonna eat this one.
Come here, love.
-Can anyone here perform marriages?
- Marriages?
You love struck witch!
Where is he?
Where'd he go?
Yoo-hoo!
Where are you?
Don't go.
Now look what you’ve done.
- He's gone! I'll never forgive you for this, Orgoch.
Never!
Whoo! There you are!
Enough! We've come for the Black Cauldron.
Did you hear that, sisters?
Why, nobody's asked for the Black Cauldron in over 2,000 years.
It's a trick. We're not going to let them have it, are we?
Don’t worry.
Leave it to me.
Perhaps I might interest you in something else: a kettle, a cook pot, a skillet, a teapot, a bucket, a jar, a platter?
See anything you like?
I don't believe it.
I've never seen a sword like that.
I've got to have that sword.
Listen carefully. We'll trade the Cauldron for the sword.
But what can they do with the Cauldron, Orddu?
Nothing! That's the point.
Don’t you see?
We'll end up with both the sword and the Cauldron.
It's decided then.
You shall have the Black Cauldron.
You mean... you'll give it to us?
That's not what I said.
You weren't listening.
We never give anything away.
What we do is bargain,
-trade.
-Well, you’ll not have my sword!
May I ask you ladies to perhaps consider this magnificent harp?
A harp?
Oh, when we want music, we send for the birds.
What would we do with a simple harp?
Wait! Gorge will trade his crunchings and munchings.
-Who would want--
-Hold it, sister. Not so fast.
All right.
I know what you want.
Yes?
No, Taran! No!
It's our only chance.
Here is my sword.
Take it.
Is it your own choice, duckling?
Remember:
With this sword, you could be the greatest of warriors.
Yes. I offer my dearest possession... in exchange for the Black Cauldron.
Agreed. We have made a bargain.
Look out!
Help!
Taran, watch out!
Great beelin'!
Duck!
Look!
The Black Cauldron.
It's ours!
I say, what funny little ducklings.
Don’t they know the Black
Cauldron is indestructible?
Now, listen carefully.
The Black Cauldron can never be destroyed.
Only its evil powers can be stopped.
Then there is a way.
But how?
A living being must climb into it... of his own free will.
Gorge is bold and brave.
He will climb into the evil Cauldron.
However, the poor duckling will never climb out alive.
Yikes!
N-N-Now, look here, madam.
Don't forget we had an agreement.
Yes. You said we could have the Cauldron.
Of course we said you could have the Cauldron.
It's not our fault you can't do anything with it.
Good-bye, goslings.
Remember, we always keep a bargain.
Whata bunch of blundering misfits!
Things just never work out when you're dealin' with people!
You can go back to feeding pigs!
I've had it!
Good-bye!
Doli's right.
It's-It's my fault.
I let you down.
Without my sword,
I'm nothing... just an assistant pig keeper.
Look, you are somebody.
You must believe in yourself.
- I believe in you.
- Y-You do?
And I think that you’re--
Uh... I mean--
- That is--
- Yes, Taran?
I mean, uh--
What I mean is
I'm grateful to all of you.
You've been true friends.
Now it's up to me--
Look!
Uh-oh. Trouble. Good-bye.
Quick! We can't let them find us.
Pig boy!
Fight where you are, pig boy.
Gotcha.
Get a move on!
Careful, now.
You! Pile them up over there!
And get that cart out of here!
Oh, oh! I'm sorry.
I've ignored you.
You did come for the Black Cauldron, didn’t you?
Good. Then climb in!
It will only cost you your life.
Oh.
Oh!
E-Everything is-is ready, sire.
My, such a brave and handsome group: a pig boy, a scullery maid... and a broken-down minstrel.
Perhaps it may interest you to see what fate has in store for you.
Now I call on my army of the dead, the Cauldron born.
Arise, my messengers of death.
Our time has arrived.
Oh, it's horrible.
My beloved warriors have come to life.
All the dead of centuries past.
Never has anyone created an army like this.
Go forth, my deathless warriors!
Destroy all in your path!
Come, sire. We can get a better view from above.
Oh, Taran.
I'm afraid it'll soon be over for us.
I-I hadn't planned it to end like this, Eilonwy.
Oh, I wish I'd stayed a toad.
Only moments away from victory.
My greatest triumph.
We did it, sire!
We did it!
I-I-I mean, I mean you.
Yes, of course, you did it, sire.
Y-Y-Yikes!
Gorge? Gorge?
Is that you?
- Master!
-Gorge... what are you doing here?
Gorge is sorry he always runs away when there's trouble.
He will untie everybody.
Then we will leave this evil place.
Yeah, but, uh, get on with it.
Good boy, Gorge! Eilonwy, you and Fflewddur go with Gorge.
I must stop the Cauldron.
Oh, but, Taran, that's impossible.
Why, you’d be--
- Taran!
- I'm sorry, Eilonwy.
Please, Taran.
No! You can't!
My mind is made up.
Wait, master!
Gorge not let you jump into Cauldron.
-Gorge, get out of my way!
-Whoa!
Whoa!
Please, master.
Not go into evil Cauldron.
If I don’t, we’re all lost.
Out of my way!
No, Gorge not let his friend die.
Taran has many friends.
Gorge has no friends.
Gorge, no!
Don't jump! Wait!
No! No!
Oh, no.
Sire?
Sire, look.
Something's wrong.
What is it, sire?
They're-They're dying!
It can’t be.
This had better not be your fault.
Perhaps it needs another body, sire.
Yes. Yours!
Get Eilonwy out of here.
Hurry!
- But, Taran, I-- Please, I--
-Go on! Go with Fflewddur.
M-Maybe there's still a chance for Gorge.
No, sire! Please!
Get up!
Come alive!
Maybe they're only resting, sire.
Do something!
My life is at stake!
Get up, you fools! Kill!
Look! Sire, look!
It's the pig boy.
It's his fault. Yes.
He's the cause of it!
You've interfered for the last time.
Go for his throat, sire.
Now, pig keeper, you shall die.
No! Don't!
What? What's this?
No, you’ll not escape.
You shall satisfy the Cauldron's hunger.
Oh, no.
No!
You'll not have me!
My power cannot die!
Curse you!
No! No!
Oh, no.
How-How-How horrible.
Poor sire.
He-He's gone.
He's gone.
He's gone!
He's gone!
Fflewddur! Eilonwy!
Over here! Hurry!
Thank goodness you're safe.
Come on, Fflewddur.
Hurry!
Run for your lives!
Come on. Jump.
Taran, look!
Quick. Get in.
Let's go.
Here. Push off, Fflewddur.
Eh? Uh-oh.
Uh, trouble.
Oh, we can't get through.
I-I'll try to open the gate.
Taran, be careful, please.
Hurry! Move on through.
Come on, Fflewddur.
Hurry!
Oh, good work, lad.
Let me give you--
Look out!
Look.
Gorge.
Gorge?
Why is the duckling so sad?
Yes. He's got what he wanted, and he's still not satisfied.
Just what do you think you're up to, ladies?
Oh, we have business with your little hero.
Hero? Gorge was the hero.
The only thing that mattered to you was the Cauldron, but now it's no use to you.
-So we'll just take it and be on our way.
Stay your hand, ladies.
We never give anything away.
We bargain. We trade. Remember?
Did-Did these old ears hear the word ''bargain''? Hmm?
Yes, madam, those old ears heard right.
Ohh!
I adore forceful men.
Oh, pull yourself together, madam.
Now, come on, out with it.
What is your offer?
- No, not my--
-Then I'll do it.
A magnificent sword for a warrior.
I'm nota warrior.
I'm a pig boy.
What would I do with a sword?
Absolutely nothing.
-But I would trade...
- Yes? the Cauldron for Gorge.
- Dear!
- It's not possible.
Justas I thought, ladies.
You've got no real power!
Admit it! Admit it!
We have made a bargain.
Oh, Taran.
Munchings and crunchings in here somewhere.
Gorge!
You're alive!
He's alive.
Great beelin', He is alive.
Oh, Fflewddur, Fflewddur.
He's alive!
I'm alive!
Gurgi's alive!
Look, look, look!
Touch me!
Gurgi, you clever little thing.
Come on, Gorge.
Let's go home.
Gurgi's happy day!
Come on.
Great beelin'.
Hmm.
You did well, my boy.
Yep.
Good morning, good morning!
That was
"A-Billion-and-One Strings," playing one of your favorite tunes.
At the top of the news this morning... there's monkey business in Utah.
A band of renegade chimpanzees... have kidnapped Pulitzer prize-winning poet Lester Charles.
What's the big idea?
I'm attempting to sleep!!
I doing a broadcasting.
Do you mind?
Whoa, not in the face!
Uh, the chimps are protesting...
I've got a mind to reset your alarm... permanently!
Sorry, folks.
We're experiencing technical difficulty... but it's nothing we can't handle!!
This just in.
Domestic violence erupts in peaceful cottage!
We'll keep you post...
Whew!
Can't hear your own thoughts with all the racket.
Holy mother of Edison!
What were you thinking?
You might have broken my bulb!
I'm thinking you think too much.
We need wake-up music.
So when it's raining
Have no regrets
Because it isn't raining rain you know
It's raining violets
Blah!
Va-rooooom!
I'll track you to the end of this carpet.
Come here.
I'm going to get you.
Wait till I fix your speaker!!
Rusetti picks it up and throws.
Cepeda tags, he heads for second.
Wait till I get my plugs on you!
[Radio]
The crowd goes wild.
Can you believe those
Brooklyn Dodgers!!
[Lamp]
I've got you.
I've got you now.
Ha, ha, ha.
Come here.
You dare to cross foils... with the greatest Saxon swordsman in the land?
[Radio]
Have you any inkling who you're dealing with?
[Lamp]
Precisely. A total idiot.
[Radio]
If your saber wags as loosely as your tongue... you'll be run through in an instant.
Defend yourself,
Sir Lampy of Locksley.
- A blow for Richard!
- Ouch!
- A blow for Marian!
- Ouch!
- A blow for Mario, the garbage man.
- Ouch!
And for the boys at the delicatessen.
And here's one for the guys on 5th Street.
No!
Whoa! Ugh!
What's going on?
Who turned out the lights?
Good morning.
Good morning,
Toaster.
- Hey, slots.
- Salutations!
Umph!
- Thanks.
- What's on our lineup today?
What are our instructions?
What are we gonna do today?
The same thing we've done for the last 2,000 days.
Chores!
- Chores?
- It'll be fun.
I'm always up for fun!
Listen, a broadcast from Ebbets Field!
It's the top of the ninth...
I don't understand how chores could be fun.
Not supposed to be fun.
It's work!
I don't like to work without the Master.
Well, okay.
If you don't want to work, why don't we play a game?
- What sort of game?
- What are the rules?
There's only one rule.
You can't stop till the house is clean.
- Boo!!
- Boo!!
- Boo!!
[Whispering]
Gotcha, pal.
Leave it to me.
Hang on to your hats, you devil dogs... because the master bebop blaster... is gonna give you a soul injection.

Hey, shhh. Quiet!
It's the blanket!
A car.
- A car?
- A car!
All right, fellows, steady.
A little to the left.
Careful.
- I'm gonna fall.
- Keep climbing.
You, get that light out of my eyes!
All right, a little to the left.
To the right!
There you go.
A little to the middle.
I don't know which direction the middle is in.
- Can you see?
- Is it him?
Any news?
I'm dying down here.
Is it the Master?
It's him.
He's back!
It's the Master!
Blanky!
Master!
Blanky!
[Blanky Crying]
Was it him?
I'm just curious.
I hate being left in the dark.
I guess we can assume that it wasn't him.
Let's get back to work.
Sorry for that interruption, folks.
We return to our regularly scheduled program... at this time.
Whaa-haa-haa.
Cry, weep, wail and sob.
It's disgusting.
Every time!!
Every single...
Give me that stupid picture.
No, no!
- I'll put it away.
- In the garbage!
- You can't!
- Wimp!
- Let go!
- He's not coming back anyway.
He might.
Fact is, there's not enough facts.
Fight breaks out in peaceful mountain cottage... shocking world and bringing
Geneva talks to a halt!
- Let me have it.
- You can't.
Oh, no.
Ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha.
What are you laughing at?
Absolutely nothing, nothing at all.
I think he was laughing at us.
You know something?
You're a bright little lamp.
Oh, thanks.
Hey.
You guys have an attachment for that kid, don't you?
Yes, he was our master.
That's real nice.
Any day he might come romping back... just come whistling back through that door... and everything will be the same... real peachy keen.
- Uh-huh.
- It's a possibility.
Well, at least we try to be optimistic.
Optimistic?
Somebody untie the knot in this guy's cord.
Why don't you just shut off?
I'm real scared, Kirby.
Are you going to suck me to death?
- Hmph!
- What is it with you?
You act like you just came off the assembly line.
Get this through your chrome.
We've been dumped, abandoned.
- But he loved us.
- That's right.
So what?
He has a family.
They move, he moves.
It's a package deal.
But...
He's not coming back, pure and simple.
Did you talk to him?
They could drive up any second.
You really think so?
I'm not talking to you.
You have a combined wattage of five, maybe less.
It's been years.
It's scrap metal time.
Do what you like.
We're not gonna give up hope.
That's real touching.
You're gonna get me bawling like a baby any time now.
I think you're jealous.
Sure, I'm jealous of a bunch of dimwits.
- Dim?
- Yeah!
The Master never played with you.
Because you're stuck in the wall!
So, it's back to that stupid static again.
You think I don't know what's going on in here?
I know what goes on in this cottage.
It's a conspiracy... and every one of you low-watts is in on it.
Just because you move around... you think you're better than I am.
I was designed to stick in a wall!
I like being stuck in this stupid wall!
I can't help it... if the kid was too short to reach my dials!
We didn't mean it, really.
It's my function!!
Don't.
Wait, wait!
- He's gonna blow!
- Yank the cord!
The fuse!
Poor Air Conditioner.
I didn't know he'd take it so hard.
He was a jerk anyway.
Hey, what's that?
What is it?
A car.
Not another word about cars.
You said it.
Sounds close.
Just don't even start.
Sounds real close.
[Car Door Closing]
[Hammering]
[Humming "Taps"]
Wah, hah, hah!
[Humming]
Stop it!
We're going out to find him.
- What?
- What do you mean?
Exactly what I said.
We're gonna go out and find the Master.
To the city?
No matter what!
How would you propose we're gonna do that, exactly?
I don't know.
Come off it.
Be serious.
I am serious.
You're insane.
If only we were wiener dogs, our problems would be solved.
What?
Maybe it was a basset hound.
You're all insane!
It was a news flash
I picked up about a dog.
In an amazing show of loyalty and courage... a terrier named Grover traveled hundreds of miles... to be reunited with his owner.
The poor critter was accidentally left behind... on a fishing trip three weeks ago.
He had to find his way across rugged mountains... and scorching deserts in order to get home.
Little Grover turned out to be one spunky pup.
If a dog can do it, we can do it!
But a dog has legs.
Ah, don't be a wet blanket.
- Legs would help.
- Brains wouldn't hurt either.
- Lay off.
- Pipe down, carpet breath.
I'm going, with or without you.
I say we stay.
We'll have a new master when someone buys the cottage.
But I don't want a new master.
I want our master.
Well... what about the rest of you?
You boys are gonna need a leader.
Alone, you wouldn't last for 5 minutes out there.
I used to be a mountaineer.
Together... we can stand against the forces of nature!
Were you really a mountaineer?
Sure, ask anybody.
Ask Teddy Roosevelt.
We shot moose together on the Klondike.
You know,
I was thinking... you guys will need somebody bright along.
- Good idea.
- Listen to this.
World War II, the Normandy Invasion... and who dare but Lampy to light the way?
You know...
I thought it would be good to have somebody come along... who's really... strong.
- And loud.
- And grumpy!
And oblivious to reality.
Well?
I just know I'm going to regret this.
[Cheering]
- Yippee!
- Hot dog!
Wow, this is our last fuse.
Good thing we're getting out of here.
I've always loved travel.
The open road, the wind in my face... the flies clogging up my grille.
Yeah? How are we going to travel?
We could all pile on top of the bed... and then Kirby can push us!
No, no.
Hey, what about the Master's pogo stick?
[Crash]
That's no good.
How about we're in the refrigerator... on a skateboard and Kirby can pull?
No, no. Hey!
- Shut up.
- Shut up!
Let somebody else try for a change.
Arise, Hassan.
Arise, oh magic carpet.
We need a longer cord.
We need an alternate power source, I say.
- I guess this is it.
- Uh-huh.
- [Sigh]
- Blanket?
Huh?
Ready to go?
Yeah, I'm ready.
Okay, Kirby.
Hmm, shag carpet.
Look, Lampy.
From here you can see the really big lamp.
Wow!!
I wonder where his switch is?
We are pioneers.
Whoa!
[Toaster]
Can't see the road anymore.
Are we going in the right direction?
[Blanky]
I don't think so.
[Radio]
You boys need a navigator.
Navigator?
I'll tune in a radio signal from the city.
I can take you right there, lickety-split.
[Static]
[Instrumental]
North by northwest.
Watch out for low-flying aircraft.
- Ow.
- What's wrong?
He stepped on me.
- Did not.
- Did too.
Did too!
Did not!
Hey, come on.
How do you expect us to get there if you're fighting?
You mean we're not there yet?
No, not yet.
We got a long way to go.
Oh, boy, you're telling me.
Life is like a journey
On the road that's within
Head says you should stay
But your heart says to begin
So you go
But you don't want to go
Any life worth living
Isn't life just filled with ease
You just stay forgiving
Through the forests and the trees
And you'll go
Just where you want to go
Time flies by in the city of light
Time stands still in the country
There's no time for a fuss and a fight
As we travel the land
And I'd be satisfied
Just to be not denied
To reside with some pride
While I ride to the city
The city of light
Light shines like a diamond in the city at night
When that diamond shines
You know that everything's all right
But you know
We got a way to go
Let us meet the Master
We don't want to make him wait
You just keep a-knocking he will open up the gate
To that city of light
Master is a man with a plan I can understand
Master is a man of great reflection
Master is a man who lays his hand across the land
Master is a man of our affection
Time flies by in the city of light
Time stands still in the country
There's no time for a fuss and a fight
As we travel the land
And I'd be satisfied
Just to be not denied
To reside with some pride
While I ride to the city
The city of light
Hey, everybody.
Look!
- A clearing!
- Great.
Spread out the blanket and have a picnic.
I'm full of stickers.
My bag's full of thistles and sticks... and who knows what else!
Whose idea was it to come this way?
The lamp's.
Oh, yeah?
Who's supposed to be the big shot navigator...
Mr. Loudmouth?
Mr. Big Loudmouth.
- Yeah.
- Where are we?
Give me a second and... listen to this.
It's the top of the ninth, the bases are loaded... and Pee Wee Reese is at the plate.
There's the pitch.
He connects.
Oh, and it's a triple play.
Knock it off!
We should all settle down... and try to get some sleep.
This is my sleeping space.
Nobody crosses this line.
You better not wake us up at 6:00 as usual.
- Why are you complaining?
You didn't work today.
- Yeah.
Go find your own place to sleep, fuzz ball.
Watch it.
Are you blind?
It's a line.
Good night!
Come on,
I'm not the Master.
Go snuggle somewhere else.
I'm trying to get some sleep.
Go on.
[Sigh]
Help!
Don't leave me.
Listen, listen.
What's that?
[Croaking]
Over there!
Oh, look!
Light.
I see light!
Croak, croak!!
Croak, croak!!
Croak, croak!!
Croak, croak!!
Croak, croak!!
Ribbit.
[Humming]
Ribbit.
[Tap, Tap, Tap]
That's the same riff I used... when I was drumming for Cab Calloway.
Like this.
Cut that out!
La, la-la-la-la-la, la
La, la-la-la-la-la, la
Booga-booga.
Boodle-boodle.
Get out of here!
Hey fellas, come look at this.
Whoa!
I'm trying to see.
Look at me!!
[Chattering]
Oh.
No, no.
It's just a reflection.
I'm not a flower.
[Laughter]
Ribbit.
Come on, help me.
They're killing me.
Leave him alone!
Stop it.
Give me that.
He was chewing on the Master.
Time to go.
Bye.
[Toaster]
Are you sure this is the right direction?
[Radio]
As sure as I am honest.
[Lampy]
Then we're definitely lost.
There might be lions in there.
And tigers and bears, oh my.
He's such a baby.
Waa-waa!
What's the matter,
Kirby?
Battery's running low.
We should give it a rest.
Turn out that light.
[Bushes Rustling]
Do we have to stop here?
Only for a while.
Just long enough to lose our minds.
We'll be cannibals within a few days.
You'll be the first to go, dial face.
Hey, fellas, we can stay here.
Look.
What's the matter?
Eaten alive, the poor sap.
Wow, wow!
I thought you were a goner.
You wish.
We are gonna need some kind of shelter.
Shelter from the likes of them.
Come here and say that, chrome-dome.
- What?
- Oh, sorry.
I meant to say
"vacuous vacuum."
Ladies and gentlemen, let's get ready to rumble.
In the blue corner, undefeated champion...
Rocko "The Radio" Ratuno.
Ding!
And there's the bell.
They're on each other like black on a bowling ball.
Look.
["Star-Spangled Banner"]
That concludes our broadcast day.
This is Lowell Winchell signing off.
Good night, America, and all the ships at sea.
Thanks.
That's all right.
So, what's this thing with you and the blanket?
What thing?
All of a sudden you're being so darn nice to him.
I was just thinking, and I got this feeling... that I should be nicer to him for a change.
And now
I feel better.
- That's weird.
- What's weird about it?
You were never this nice to him before... and now you're nice to him all the time.
I don't know.
I'm just trying to understand, figure out what it means.
It's kinda hard to describe.
It's like being next to a new loaf of bread.
Hmm, let's see.
It's like a warm, toasty feeling inside.
Like a glow.
- A glow?
- Yeah.
I think I know what you're talking about.
It's like the feeling I get when I think about the Master.
That's it.
I remember the first time my bulb burned out.
I thought,
"That's it.
"It's over.
I'm burned out.
Eighty-sixed.
To the showers!!"
But then the Master put in a brand-new bulb.
And I just glowed.
That's all there is to it.
That's very interesting.
Good night, slot head.
Good night.
Blah.
Ahh.
Run.
[Wicked Laughter]
[Thunder]
Aahh. Help me!
Help me!
Toaster!
Blanky!!
- Blanky?
- Blanky!
Where are you?
- Blanky?
- Blanky!!
- Blanket!
- Can you hear me?
The battery's gone dead!
We're trapped like rats... small rats with no hair and one light.
Blanky!
- Blanket!!
- Blanky!!
Where are you, you little wimp?
Blanky!!
Lampy!
Blanky?
Where are you?
Blan...
...keey?
Come on, Blanky, speak up!
Just relax.
You've done enough.
We'll look for him.
I am feeling burned out.
Listen.
Lamp was awarded a Purple Heart... for being wounded in the line of duty.
Lamps across the nation were switched off... for a moment of silence in respect for his bravery.
Help.
- Listen.
- Help me.
Toaster, Kirby,
I'm stuck.
- I hear him.
- But I can't see him.
Maybe he's calling from blanket heaven.
He's a puffy yellow angel, with a knob nose.
He's just stuck, that's all. Look!
Help.
[Toaster]
Hang on tight.
I am.
[Radio]
Don't let the tremendous height scare you.
Hey, watch out.
Come on.
I can't see.
Get off.
Watch out below!!
That was kind of fun.
Now get off of my face!
- Thanks, Kirby.
- Great idea.
You saved me.
I knight thee
"Sir Vac."
Cut it out.
I did it so we could go.
We're wasting time.
[Thunderous Noise]
What's this?
What's...
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Kirby, no!
Get the cord out of his mouth!
Don't let him swallow it.
Switch him off.
Just shorted right out.
Cracked up, snapped, sold the farm.
- Poor chump.
- How's he look?
Better than you, actually.
Keep it up, slots.
Carpet-sweeping motions.
He should come around.
Hey, I think it's working.
Kirby, can you hear me?
Wake up.
Wake up!
- Kirby!
- You're all right.
Yeah!
Lay off.
Just lay off!
- What's the matter?
- We were worried.
You gave us a scare, pal.
There's nothing wrong with me, pal!
- Just back off!
- Don't be angry.
Keep your antennas, knobs, and wires... and rivets off my chrome!
Who needs you?
Got to drag you around all the time.
I'd be better off without you.
But...
Especially you, you little rag.
So how do we get across this thing, anyway?
Houdini did this once.
He was out of the hospital in no time.
That's encouraging.
Okay, Kirby.
Hey, we're not dead.
Yeah? Where's some wood to knock on?
Toaster, you okay?
Toaster?
Yeah, I am.
Give me some slack.
Oh.
Wha...
Agh.
Aaahhhh!
Yeowwww!
Help! Help!
Damn thee, thou cursed whale!!
From the depths of hell
I stab at thee.
- Climb on, you idiot.
- Oh, it's you.
Where's Toaster?
He sank.
Are we glad to see you!
I really thought I'd turned in my warranty.
Yeah, until baggy showed up.
I just slipped and fell in, that's all.
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Sure!
You can't fool us.
We love you.
Like Mrs. Roosevelt loved her husband.
Here's the shore.
Everybody off.
Listen to this!
This is President Roosevelt... awarding the vacuum the Medal of Honor.
Blah!
Ha, ha!
That's funny.
I'm dying.
Where are we?
I can't believe this.
I'm really sorry.
Oh, come on.
It's not your fault.
Things could be worse, you know.
- How?
- How what?
How could they be worse?
They couldn't.
I lied.
Can't you find anything?
I'm lucky my backup batteries work at all.
I hope we're not going in circles.
Come on.
Aaah!
I knew I shouldn't have let you guys drive.
Come on, pull!
Kirby!
This is great fun.
Let's make these outings a regular thing, okay?
Inflate your bag!
Help me!
Aaah!
Wow, the poor guy didn't have a chance.
Just ssss, and that's it.
Don't look now, but you're about to ssss yourself!
What? Whoa!
Blanky, let go.
Try to untie yourself.
I'm not scared.
Well, that concludes our broadcast today.
Actually, it concludes... all future broadcasting of any sort.
We'll sign off now with a suitable tune!
Mammy
Mammy, Mammy
I'm coming
Oh l...
I hope I didn't make you wait
Mammy
I'm coming
O, Lord
Ha, I thought
I heard a radio!
Whoa!
Hmmm.
Do-dilly yup-bup-bup
Upsy-daisy!
Whoop!!
There you go!!
Good boy, Quadruped.
You remembered your seat belt.
Ahh.
[Ding-Ding]
A customer!
Seems like a nice fella.
Dingy, but nice.
Heh-heh-heh!!
Heh-heh-heh!
Mister St. Peters is quite an amusing fellow... isn't he?
Oh, you poor baby.
Your bulb is burned out.
Here, you can have one of mine.
Use it in good health... while you still can.
[Ding]
[Customer]
Hello, compadre...
I am in deep need of a blender motor.
Ha, ha!
A blender motor?
I got a whole shipment ofblender motors in last week.
[Customer]
Heaven sent you to me.
I'll have it for you in
2 shakes of a lamb's tail.
Now what did I do with that blender?
I could've sworn I left it here a second ago.
I'm getting as loopy as a polecat... without any whiskers.
There you are!
I found you.
Gotta move you guys out of the way.
[Crack]
Ha, ha!
Whoa.
Boy, are you some lucky guy!!
This was the last one left.
Heh-heh!!
Heh-heh-heh!!
You never quite know what he's going to do.
He's so spontaneous.
W-w-well, how do we escape?
Did you hear that?
They want to know how to escape!
Heh-heh-heh!
[Spooky Organ Music]
Watch yourself
Don't fall off of the shelf
You must be the new boys in town
What's that sound
Is someone moving 'round
Sit down for a spell
You don't look so well
Wait a minute
I feel great
You just leave yourself to fate
You might as well just hang around
It's too late
We've got to operate
Just try to relax
It's a house of wax
Oh, I remember
Frankenstein
Shivers up my spine
Whoa-oh
I'm for getting out of here
No need to shout my dear
No-oh
Who will go to the cellar down below
Trouble is a-bubbling in the brew
While you're down there
Mr. Vincent Price will give you good advice
He'll know what to do
You just tell him boo
He will put the voodoo in the stew, I'm telling you
It's like a movie
It's a B-movie show
It's like a movie
It's a B-movie show
Look at me.
Barf, barf, barf!
I'm a can opener, a lamp, and a shaver.
Oh, God,
I'm a mishmash!
This is weird
It's much worse than I feared
I'll close my eyes and make it disappear
- This is strange
- It ain't home on the range
You just tell St. Pete that you got cold feet
There goes the sun
Here comes the night
Somebody turn on the light
Somebody tell me that fate has been kind
You can't go out
You are out of your mind
It's like a movie
It's a B-movie show
It's like a movie
It's a B-movie show
Ah-ahh
Ah-ahh
Ah-ahh
Ah-ahh
Ah-ahh ah-ahh
Ahhh
[Ding-Ding]
[Customer] Excuse me, the missus loved the blender motor.
Was wondering if you got some radio tubes, too.
Sure.
I got a whole shipment of radio tubes in this morning.
You gotta help me.
I'll do anything!
I can get you bread, mounds of hot cross buns.
Pull yourself together!
Now what did I do with that radio?
I could swear I left it right here... in this very, very spot.
What did it do, get up and walk away?
I really should drink more coffee.
Aha!
There you are!
Ha, ha!
I got ya!
Bo-bub-bup
Kirby, what should we do?
I don't know.
Hey!
I've got an idea!
A-hoo!!
Whoa-oh-oh!
Aaah!
See? It worked!
I told you!
I told you!
I knew!
It worked!
Jailbreak!
Jailbreak!
[Siren]
Oh, ooh.
What?
Did I catch you at a bad time?
Just wondering if you got my radio tubes.
Wow!
Yee-hoo!
Honey... are you taking enough underwear?
Mom, you bought me enough underwear to stock the whole dorm.
Do you have enough socks?
I'm not going toJupiter,
I'm going to college.
- It's just college.
- So let me worry a little bit.
I'm your mother.
[Doorbell]
That's Chris.
We're going to the cabin... and pick up the lamp and radio and stuff.
I can use them at the dorm.
Hi, Rob.
You ready?
Good-bye, Mom!
Take a sweater.
Hey, Plugsy.
- Yeah?
- Did you hear that?
He's taking some old... stuff to the dorm... instead of us.
All right, go!!
You're gonna like this cabin.
Too bad we have to sell it.
[Blanky]
How are we gonna find the Master... in this big place?
Here it is.
[Ding]
Excuse me... could you tell us how to get to...
To, uh...
2470 McBean Parkway.
[Ding]
A113.
This is it.
Go ahead.
He's not home.
We'll have to wait.
Let's wait inside and relax!
But it's locked.
Luckily, my war training included inter-appliance codes.
I will simply render the secret appliance knock... and we'll be welcomed by the native machinery.
Stand aside, my meager companion.
Hiya, pal!
It's them!!
What are we gonna do?
Should we let them in?
Shhh!!
All right.
How do ya do?
Tarry not upon our doorstep.
Please feel free to enter, all of ya.
Boy, you were some lucky kid.
Every summer for as long as I can remember... we'd be running all over this place.
I looked her straight into those big blue eyes.
It was you who killed Johnson.
Parker found out and you killed him.
Then you tried to get me.
It's your turn, sweetheart.
Now you're taking the fall.
There was a shot!
A puff of smoke!
We ran like the dickens!
- And that's how we got here.
- Wow!
Well, something like that.
And all on your own, too.
How convenient.
I mean...
- Remarkable.
- Yeah.
Junkyard refugees...
- in this house.
- What's the world coming to?
I wouldn't sew a stitch on that raggedy blanket.
If you could call it a blanket.
- Looks like an old diaper.
- It smells.
- It's raggedy.
- Get that thing away from me.
- Did someone wash that thing?
- No.
Yuck.
I'm nauseous.
Oh, how do you do?
How do you do?
Hey, look at this!!
Boy!!
He sure has grown.
What a heartbreaker!
He graduated, too!
Of course!
He knows how to work hard.
He's all big now.
- I hope he still needs us.
- Still needs you?
That's the silliest thing
I ever heard!
If it isn't old rabbit ears!
If it isn't old loudmouth!
- Hi, TV!
- How ya doing?
I've got a few more seasons left.
The cottage wasn't the same after they took you away.
Yeah, it wasn't as noisy.
I see you haven't changed.
Kind of gives you a sense of security.
[Blanky]
Where's the Master?
[TV]
No one told you?
Is he gonna be surprised when he gets back!
He just left to drive out to the...
[Speaking Spanish]
- Hey!
- What's the idea?
Oh, many pardons.
Was you watching that channel?
Come on in.
It's the greatest, isn't it?
You guys sure did some weird stuff with your furniture.
What happened?
This is... Gee!
Somebody trashed the whole cottage!
You big dumbo.
Didn't you lock the doors?
I don't believe
I've ever seen... quite so many smiles before.
I've never seen contraptions with so many... buttons and knobs and dials before.
Naturally.
We are on the cutting edge of technology.
- Wow.
- What does that mean?
I don't know.
What does that mean?
[Electronic Beeps]
Since you came here uninvited
We all knew you'd be delighted
This is not the time or place to hedge
No one here would be so bold to
But since you asked and no one's told you
Let us take you to the cutting edge
I can process words accounting too
And my pixel screen displays for you
Computer graphics locked into your memory
With fiber optics cast in plastic
For natural sights and sounds fantastic
Just reach out and talk to your dear old uncle Emery
More, more, more
Everything you wanted and more
More, more, more
Let me tell you what it's for
Here's the printout with the score
Get yourself together on the edge
Ooo-ahh-ooo
You want to go to old
Rio deJaneiro, my dear
You want tojoin in any Club Paradise
You'd rather stay at home where the picture is clear
You get it on the stereo and you don't even have to go
More, more, more
Everything you wanted and more
More, more, more
Any time or place you wish
You might meet up with some dish
Pull yourself together on the edge
If you want a lean machine to whip up some mean cuisine
I'm on the scene totally automatic
I can bake your biscuits too
Pop some dough boy out for you
I'm micro solid-state and that's no static
More, more, more
Everything you wanted and more
More, more, more
We're the bytes and chips to call
You just have yourself a ball
It's all hyperactive on the edge
From LEDs to CRTs, woofers tweeters, antenna trees
An ultra-nylon life of ease
Everything you dreamed of on the edge
- And more!
- And more!
Where's the toaster?
Where's the vacuum?
Whoa!
What's going on?
Where's the radio, the lamp and blanket?
Whoa!
[Engine Roar]
I'm glad the Master has such good appliances.
Yeah, couldn't get any more modern.
They're wonderful.
[Mom]
Honey, take some of our things.
This lamp would look so cute in your dorm room.
Go for it.
What are you going to read by?
I'll buy some candles.
I won't read.
I'll go out.
I'm not gonna take your stuff.
I'll just pick up a few cheap things this afternoon.
That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
Appliances, cheap appliances... available now at
Ernie's Disposal.
Where's a good bargain place around here?
You should have gone for the new stuff.
Oh, were you in line first?
After you, of course!
Pardon me!
I can't take this kind of pressure
I must confess
One more dusty road
Would just be a road too long
Worthless
I just can't
I just can't
I just can't seem to get started
I don't have the heart to live in the fast lane
All that is past and gone
Worthless
And there ain't nothing you can do about it!
Pardon me while I panic!
Worthless
Worthless
Worthless
No, that place is too expensive.
Cheap!
We're talking real cheap!
What about Rooney's down on 53rd?
They've got used vacuums and junk.
This just in.
Rooney's vacuums found to be... carcinogenic in recent lab tests!
Big, big tumors on those rats.
We've got photos to prove it... and I don't even want to look at them.
I come from
K.C., Missouri
And I got my kicks on Route 66
Every truck stop from Butte to M.O.
Motown to old Alabama
From Texarkana and east of Savannah
From Tampa to old Kokomo
Worthless
I once ran the Indy 500
I must confess
I'm impressed how I did
And I wonder how close that I came
Now I get a second sensation
I was the top of the line
Out of sight out of mind
So much for fortune and fame
A bargain in every buck!
A buck in every pocket!
A pocket in, uh, every trouser!
Ernie's Bargain Circus... where you ride the Ferris wheel of values... toward a better tomorrow.
Once took a Texan to a wedding
Once took a Texan to a wedding
He kept forgetting his loneliness
Letting his thoughts turn to home and return
I took a man to a graveyard
I beg your pardon
It's quite hard enough
Just living with the stuff
I have learned
Worthless
Let's go cruising and see what we can find.
Why wander endlessly through the sprawling wasteland... they call the city... when your dreams are all under one roof?
Our roof, corner of 3rd and E.
Crazy Ernie's
Amazing Emporium... of total bargain madness!
Ha-ha-ha!
Ha!
Have you ever heard of this place before?
Looks pretty neat.
Once drove a surfer to sunset
There were bikinis and buns filled with weenies
Fellini just couldn't forget
Pico, let's go up to Zuma
Pico, let's go up to Zuma
From Zuma to Yuma the rumor was
I had a hand in the lay of the land
Get up and go hit the highway
Ooo-ooo
I worked on a reservation
Ooo-ooo
Who would believe they would love me
And leave on a bus back to old Santa Fe
Once in an
Indian nation
I took the kids on the skids
With a Hopi was happy to lie in the shade
You're worthless
This sure doesn't look like...
Crazy Ernie's Amazing Emporium of total bargain madness.
- It's the right address.
- Hmm.
Oh!
At least we'll all go together.
That's looking at the bright side, isn't it?
The Master's down there!
Look!
- It's him!
- What? Where?
Why look, it is him!!
Maybe he still needs us!
Yeah!
Chris?
Hey, these are hard to find.
This is me.
What?
I can't hear you.
I don't get it.
There he is.
I can't believe it.
Freeze.
Here he comes.
[Clink-Clink]
You jump off one side,
I'll jump off the other.
Okay, I got it.
Which side?
- Right side.
- Okay.
I'm glad we don't have to do this every day.
Look!
Hey Rob, come here.
What?
Doggone it!
- He's coming back.
- He'll see us this time.
Run!
This looks just like my old blanket.
I think it is my blanket.
That's my radio.
Hey, Chris!
And the lamp!
Hey, Chris!
Wait a minute!
These are mine.
Let go!
Whoa!
Let me down!
Aaah!
Chris! Help!
Where are you?
Rob?
Chris!
Aaah!
Whew!
Would you cool it?
Get down here.
You're scaring me to death.
Really now.
Why don't you just buy a new one?
Where could I find another toaster like this?
Like that?
Probably nowhere.
Ah-ha!
Bye, Mom.
I love you.
I'll call you tonight.
You forgot your sweater!!
We did good, didn't we?
Yep, we did good.
You know,
I've been thinking.
This college business seems like a good idea.
I can absorb a lot of interesting facts.
I'm picking up a news flash!
President Roosevelt has declared today a national holiday... in honor of those five amazing appliances we've heard about.
So lock up the office, take down the top... and open that rumble seat!
Last one to Coney Island is a party pooper.
From the starlight roof high atop the Ritz... we wish our intrepid little friends... the best of luck... and a fond farewell!
Ah, you're all a bunch of junk.
Tanya, Fievel?
Will you stop that twirling, twirling?
Uh, no. No more.
That's it. Time for bed. Come.
But, Mama, it's Hanukkah!
For you, every night is Hanukkah.
Papa, enough already.
They'll never get to sleep.
All right. All right.
Presents.
What about presents?
Presents? What presents?
Oh, Papa.
Just a joke.
For Tanya, a new babushka.
Happy Hanukkah.
Oh, Papa. Thank you.
You have only one parent?
Thank you, Mama.
Hmm.
And for you, Fievel, a new hat.
And not just any hat.
A new hat that has been in the family for three generations.
It belonged to me, my father, and my father's father, and now, it belongs to you.
Happy Hanukkah.
It's too big!
You'll grow.
Ah, did I ever tell you about the Giant Mouse of Minsk?
No.
No.
Was it anything like the mouse with the long hair that the prince climbed up?
No. This mouse, the Mouse of Minsk, was tall as a tree.
His tail was a mile long.
Really?
Really.
He was so big, he frightened all the cats.
Shh!
Don't say that word.
Talk about something else.
America.
Another fairy tale.
America.
What a place!
What a place!
What a place!
In America, there are mouse holes in every wall.
Who says?
Everyone!
In America, there are bread crumbs on every floor!
You're talking nonsense.
In America, you can say anything you want.
But most important...
And this I know for fact, in America, there are no cats.
Shh. They'll hear you.
How could they hear us?
There, you see?
The Cossacks! The Cossacks!
Don't cry, Yasha.
I'll scare them away.
Fievel, you'll get hurt!
Go away!
Go away, cats! Go away!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Fievel, angel, are you all right?
Yes, Mama.
Then never do that again!
Mama, look.
In America, there are no cats.
Look, Papa, water.
Is it the ocean?
Yes. Keep walking.
Look, Papa, smoke!
Is the boat on fire?
No. No. Keep walking!
Look, Papa, birds!
Are they seagulls?
Keep walking!
Keep walking!
Keep walking!
I just wanted to see.
Fievel, this is the last time I take you to America.
Bye-bye!
Auf Wiedersehen.
Auf Wiedersehen.
Ooh, auf Wiedersehen!
You know I got a cousin in America.
Ah!
You and everybody else.
Huh?
Are we there yet?
Not yet. Soon.
How soon?
Soon.
Maybe we should have stayed in Russia.
We'll be all right.
As long as we're together, we'll be all right.
Ah, so, Mr. Curious, you've discovered the herring.
Herring?
I thought they were fish.
But, Fievel, herring are fish.
Really?
Certainly.
In the ocean, there are all kinds of fish, and herring is one of them.
All kinds?
Yes. Tiny fishes, not so tiny fishes, fishes as big as this boat.
Wow!
Let's go up and see the fish!
Not now.
Your mama's worried.
Come back, Fievel.
Wait!
Oh, what am I going to do with you?
You stay closer to home!
Don't you go running off again!
Mama!
Ah, so we return, hmm?
We saw some fish!
Fish?
Lucky you didn't see some cats.
Cats!
Cats!
Oh!
I didn't see any cats.
Whew.
Won't it be nice to get to America where we don't have to worry about cats anymore?

Ah! A little immigrant.
Now they are coming by bottle.
Uh, where is your papa?
Your maman, eh?
I don't know. They were on the boat to America.
Ah! Then you are in luck, my little immigrant.
This is America!
America.
I thought it was bigger.
Oh, it is bigger.
All of that is also America.
Wow!
This is just an island at the doorway where I, Henri le pigeon, am putting up my

But how?
It's so far away, and it's so big!
I'll never find them anyway.
But did you say,
"Never"?
So young, and you have lost hope.
Ah, this is America, the place to find hope!

Take my little friend to immigration.
You will find your family there.
Everyone goes through immigration.
I would take you there myself, but then I'd never finish my statue.

Good luck!
Good-bye!
Come on, keep it moving, keep it moving.
All right.
Hurry, hurry!
Yes, sir! Step off the boat and into prosperity!
Welcome, greenhorns!
This is America!
Today's special, the Brooklyn
Bridge, just a dollar!
Golly, the Brooklyn Bridge!
Ticket to Chicago!
Used only once!
Gee whiz!
Only once, Ma.
Apple, apple?
Get my apple while it lasts.
Hurry, it's going fast!
I'll take one!
Eighteen, 19, 20, 21.
Would you please put out that filthy thing?
I'm suffocating down here.
You don't like it?
Hey, you know you're not the only cockroach in New York City.
There are millions of roaches who'd give their left feet to work for Warren T. Rat.
Good. Fire me!
I'm fed up with that filthy smoke...
Hey!
And this pocket!
I've seen kitchen stoves cleaner than this place.
Hey, come on.
Look at my suit.
All right, all right, Digit.
All right.
Hey, how much money did we make today?
Oh.
Oh, well. Well, let's see.
Uh, seven, nine, four, six, carry one, drop two.
Uh, take five, five down, seven up, 98.6...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And two plus two is 22.
What did we make?
What's the boodle?
Oh, so far, we have collected $89 and...
And 13 cents. Uh-oh.
And we'll get another 17 from Moe.
Uh, that's 50 cents less than yesterday.
What?
Fifty cents!
I hate to lose money.
Mmm. Where can I pick up an extra 50 cents?
Bye!
Au revoir, my little immigrant!
Huh?
Hmm. Hey, boss, a kid.
Hmm. You know, Moe can always use an extra kid at 50 cents a day.
Yeah.
Very interesting.
Ahem! Well, well, well!
Rat's the name, Warren T. Rat.
What can I do you for, kid?
I'm looking for my family.
Hey, you come to the right fellow, kid.
I know exactly where they are.
Come with me.
But Henri said I'd find them here!
Have it your way, kid.
But remember what Shakespeare said.
And I quote.
"Opportunity knocks but..."
Uh... But, uh...
Psst! Once!
"But... But once!
"Taken at the tide, t'will lead to fortune.
"If denied, t'will never return."
Do you really know where my family is?
Trust me. Hey, trust me.
Mama, I keep having this feeling that Fievel's alive.
Tanya, it will go away.
After a while, it will go away.
Come with me.
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't break a gut there.
"O! Pardon me,
"thou bleeding piece of earth,
"That I am meek and gentle with these butchers."
This is where they are.
Papa!
Not bad, huh, Moe?
A new worker.
What about my family?
You don't need a family, kid.
You got a job here!
Just send me his salary, will you?
And where do you think you're going?
You're mine! Now get to work!
You! What are you looking at?
Back to work!
I want to get out of here.
You and me both.
I have to find my family.
Oh, shut up! Go to sleep.
Pipe down.
Oh, be quiet!
I wish we had that mouse with the long hair.
She could drop her hair out the window, and we can all climb down.
Sure. Out the window.
Oh, fairy tales!
Wait a minute!
This kid may have something.
Tony Toponi's the name.
Put it there. Well, uh...
Fievel.
Fievel Mousekewitz.
Fievel!
Ooh, that name's got to go!
Hey, I'll tell you what...
Fillie!
Fillie?
Yeah!
Fits you perfect!
Hey, Fillie.
You got any idea where your family is?
Fillie!

Grand and Hester streets!
Here, Papa. Here I am.
Papa?
Are you there?
Oh, my word! A mouse!
What's going on up there?
Hey! Shut up out there!
What's going on up there?
Hey, Fillie!
I've been looking all over for you.
Pardon the expression, but you look like something the cat dragged in, you know?
Hey, you all right?
Yeah, I guess so.
Listen, you go running off like that and you're gonna get yourself seriously lost.
Stick with me, okay?
Hey, hey, hey. Hey!
What, we engaged or something?
Why can't we try to find Fievel, Papa?
Oh.
Just try!
I know, Papa.
Play your violin.
Play Fievel's song.
Oy, Tanya.
Maybe he'll hear it.
You can't find what's not there.
Okay, okay.
I got it all figured out.
We'll start looking for your family over in...
This is America.
Don't be afraid.
Are you going to let those cats push you around?
Tony? Hey, Tony, where you going?
I ask you this.
Are we going to stand by and let cats wreck our homes, our businesses and our lives?
If we all got together, we could do something about the cats!
Yeah. We should all get together.
This is America.
We have free speech.
You can say "cat" here.
Cat, cat, cat!
And double cat!
Shh! Not so loud.
Shh.
Please, not that word.
Wait a minute. Come back!
Where are you going?
Oh.
So, if we all got together, we could do something about the...
Cats.
Yeah.
Cat...
Ca...
Cat.
Tony?
Tony, what's wrong with you?
But there are no cats in America.
That does it.
I'm getting out of here!
Mmm-hmm, me too.
What are you all afraid of?
Cats, cats, cats, cats.
Papa told me.
Everyone knows it.
There are no cats.
Hey, you all right?
I mean, you ain't hurt or nothing, are you?
No. No, I'm okay.
Thank you.
No, really, I'm all right.
Really, I am.
How about you?
Nah!
Who do those cats think they are?
I'll show them a thing or two next time.
Hey, where's Fillie?
Fillie? Who's Fillie?
Oh, I gotta find him.
He's just a kid.
Fillie!
Tony!
Whoa!
Phew! Hmm. Some scrap, huh?
There are cats here.
Wait till I tell Papa!
If I find him.
You see, he's looking for his family.
Aw, the poor darling.
Wait a minute!
Honest John, at Tammany Hall.
He'll know where your family is.
He will?
Tony, he knows every mouse in the city!
Ha! Told you to stick with me, yeah?
Come on.
Oh!
Well, Mr. There Are
No Whats in America?
Mmm?
Cats.
It's me third wake today, and I'm not finished.
We've got to do something about them cats.
Besides paying Warren T. Rat for no protection.
Oh, oh, poor lad.
So young.
He never had a chance to vote.
Well, he'll vote from now on.
I'll see to that.
Honest John.
It's Gussie Mausheimer!
Oh.
Ooh-whee, the richest and most powerful mouse in New York.
What's she doing slumming in this part of town?
There's a dead mouse on that table.
It's an Irish custom, Gussie.
The cats got him today.
Precisely why I am here to see you.
Would you care for a wee drop of the creature?
Today was the worst ever.
Those cats are killing everyone!
They don't even know the difference between rich and poor.
The wretches!
Oh, shameful!
As you know,
I have dedicated my life to helping those less fortunate than myself.
Uh, that's everyone.
And now I want you to help me.
We must have a wawwy.
A wawwy? What's a wawwy?
You know, a wawwy.
A large gathering of mice for a reason.
Oh, a rally!
That's what I said, a wawwy.
Tomorrow at Mausheimer Park, we will all decide what to do.
I'll bring the uptown mice and you bring the mice from downtown.
Madam, you can count on Honest John.
At last, we're all getting together about the cats.
Bridget.
Oh, Fillie.
Honest John, he's lost his family.
By any chance, do you know the Mousekewitzes?
Oh, hmm.
Are they registered to vote?
They just got off the boat.
Oh.
Sorry, don't know them yet.
That's my mother and father.
The cats got them two years ago November.
Now, don't you worry.
Yours are all right.
And they're out there somewhere.
Now.
Get some sleep.

We have got to do something about these cats.
Not so loud! They'll hear you!
So?
Let them hear me.
You can talk!
You're rich!
Money is not everything.
I know, because I have money and I have everything,
but what are they worth without freedom?
Hear, hear!
Yeah! Right!
Why did we come to America?
For freedom!
Why are they building that statue?
What does it stand for?
Freedom!
So what do we want?
Freedom!
Right!
Freedom from cats.
And because this is America, we can do something about them!
What do we do?
Papa, I can't see.
They're bigger than we are!
Not if we all work together.
What are you afraid of?
Are we men, or are we mice?
Mice!
Mice, indeed, and proud of it!
So, what are we going to do about those cats?
Well?
Any ideas?
Ahem.
Oh, yes, well, I...
Oh, dear.
I have an idea.
Yes?
Hmm.
What did he say?
Uh, he, he said, uh...
Uh-huh.
Hmm...
Ohh.
Yes. Cute little fellow.
Wait a minute.
I think this little fellow has got something here.
We have a plan!
Oh, Papa.
She's in the way again!
Look out below!
Shh!
We have a plan!
E pluribus unum!
Ladies and gentlemen,
I want to thank you so much for your participation.
And I want to close by saying, that a vote for Honest John is a vote for freedom!
Freedom is what it is!
And thank you again, one and all!
Holy spumoni!
We should have been at the pier an hour ago!
The pier?
That's a scary place!
I promised Bridget we'd be on time.
Wait for me! Wait!
Geez Louise, am I in the doghouse!
Pick 'em up!
Tell me what time it was, huh?
But, Tony, I can't tell time!
Tony, slow down! Wait!
Wait!
Papa?
Tony!
Papa!
I'm coming, Papa!
Papa?
All right, ante up, boys.
Hey, no cheating.
Hmm.
Ooh! I got it! I got it!
I got it!
Rummy!
Tiger, for the hundredth time, we're playing poker.
I knew that. I knew that.
But who can concentrate with all that, you know, noise?
Hey, Tiger.
When the boss plays, it's culture.
Sure, culture.
I think it sounds, uh, melodious.
"If music be the food of love,
"play on, McDuff, play on."
Oh, I don't know which is worse, the music or the Shakespeare.
Rats! This nose, this nose here keeps getting in the way!
You... You could stop playing.
That's funny.
I've never known a cockroach with good taste.
But, I've known plenty that taste...
Good.
Play, play, play!
Ahem. Hmm.
Warren T!
You!
You're not a rat!
You're a cat!
How did you get in here?
Come here, you little...
Gentlemen, cat's out of the bag!
Get me that mouse!
Let me at him.
I mean, let me at him.
I'll kill him! Get out of my way!
Get out of my way!
You just stepped on my tail!
Come here, you little runt!
Get him!
Get him!
Once more.
There is the boat.
The boat whistle blows at 6:00 in the morning, and that is when we must release the secret weapon!
So, the cats must be here at 6:00 on the dot, not a moment before or after.
Now, when you go to get the cats, what do you do to make them come here?
Nyah nyah nyah-nyah nyah.
Right!
Now get some sleep.
We have a long day ahead.
No, no, no.
Boss, it was not me.
I promise, that wasn't me.
Wake up.
Uh, wake up.
Jake! Wake up.
You're up.
Uh, go get some sleep, Jake.
Oh, yeah, you're right.
Rest, sleep.
On your guard, Tiger!
Don't make any funny moves.
'Cause I'm crafty, and I'm quick.
I have the instinct of a cat.
What am I saying?
I am a cat!
Oh, hey, now don't start that.
I didn't mean to scare you that much, really.
It's okay, little buddy.
Hey, I'm your friend.
Aw, come on.
Be happy.
Aw.
Oh, come on.
What are you crying for?
I can't get out of here and I have to, so I can find my family.
You lost your family?
Mmm-hmm.
Oh, no.
That's terrible.
You know, I lost my family, too.
Years ago, I mean.
Eight brothers...
Ten sisters...
Three fathers...
Don't cry.
You'll find them.
Do you really think so?
Gee, you're nice.
Um, my name is Tiger.
What's yours?
Fievel, Fievel Mousekewitz.
Oh, dear.
Listen. I like mice.
Oh, no, not like that.
I mean, I don't eat red meat at all.
I'm a vegetarian.
That's right.
Oh, a little fish now and then.
But what I really like is some nice... Shh...
Broccoli.
You know, I thought all cats were supposed to be mean.
Mean? Ha!
I am mean!
Then... And...
Aw, what's the use?
I like butterflies with big golden wings and blue and green tips.
Me, too!
Yeah? Ha.
I like Swiss cheese ice cream.
Me, too! Me, too!
You too, too? Hmm.
Wait a minute.
What's your favorite book?
Um, The Brothers Karamazov.
The Brothers...

All right. Then, I take it we can't do business.
Warren, you're through.

It's the Giant Mouse of Minsk!
Oh, you're right.
Yay!
Head for the pier!
We did it!
Whoa!
They can't swim!
Ladies and gentlemen, credit where it's due.

No, Papa.
Look.
Get a load of this, huh.
Hey, kid, you're sleeping in my place.
Huh?
Hey, give me that!
Got any food on you?
Hey, what's your story?
I've been looking for my family.
Hey, fellows, he's looking for his family.
He's looking for his family!
I stopped that a long time ago.
At least you know who they are.
Yeah!
Why are you looking for them?
They should be looking for you.
They don't care.
Forget them.
You're right, they don't care!
And if they did, they would have found me.
Well, if they don't care,
I don't care!
I don't care if I never see them again.
Yeah, you're nothing.
You're junk, you're trash.

Never

Mama!
What's come over me?
I am hugging a cat.
I've never been so happy in my life.
I have friends, lots of little tiny friends.
Oh, Tony, isn't it grand?
Say, I don't hear no one thanking me here.
Oh!
Fievel, I knew you were alive. I knew it!
Oh, my little boy back from the dead.
America. Hmm.
What a place.
My Fievel.
I thought I would never see you again.
Never say never, Papa.
Oh!
Oh! I nearly forgot.
Here, Fievel, your hat.
Your hat... It fits.
My son.
Now, you are a mouse.
My statue is finished.
Wait till you see her.
She is beautiful.
Magnifique.
Mama, look, don't be afraid to open your eyes.
Look what you're missing.
You're missing everything.
Papa, when we land, I'll look.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
No, whoa!
This is... Oh, whoa, whoa!
Oh, oh, this is nice.
Oh, thanks, fellas.
I appreciate you coming back for me.
You in the front, higher, higher!
Whoa!

Wow.

Have you ever seen anything so wonderful in your entire life?
Wow! Cool! But, uh, what is it?
I don't know, but I bet Scuttle will.
What was that?
Did you hear something?
Mmm? I wonder what this one is.
- Ariel?
- Flounder, will you relax?
Nothing is going to happen.
Shark!
Shark! We're gonna die!
Oh, no!
You big bully!
Flounder, you really are a guppy.
I am not.
♪ Hmm-hmm, fourteen hundred and ninety-two ♪
♪ Dah-de-dum
Dee-do-do ♪
♪ Rum-dim-dim
Dee-do-dee-do ♪
- Scuttle!
- Whoa!
Mermaid off the port bow!
Ariel, how you doin', kid?
- Whoa, what a swim.
- Scuttle, look what we found.
We were in this sunken ship, and it was really creepy...
Human stuff, huh? Hey, let me see.
Oh! Oh! Look at this.
Wow. This is special.
This is very, very unusual.
- What? What is it?
- It's a dinglehopper.
Humans use these little babies... to straighten their hair out.
See? Just a little twirl here and a yank there and violee...
Ya got an aesthetically pleasing configuration of hair that humans go nuts over.
A dinglehopper.
- What about that one?
- Ah!
This I haven't seen in years.
This is wonderful!
- A banded, bulbous snarfblatt.
- Oh!
The snarfblatt dates to prehistorical times when humans used to sit around and stare at each other all day.
Got very boring.
So, they invented this snarfblatt to make fine music.
Allow me.
Music!
- It's stuck!
- Oh, the concert!
Oh, my gosh! My father's gonna kill me!
The concert was today?
You could make a little planter out of it.
I'm sorry! I've gotta go!
Thank you, Scuttle!
Any time, sweetie!
Any time.
Yes, hurry home, Princess.
We wouldn't want to miss old Daddy's celebration, now, would we?
Ha! Celebration, indeed. Oh, bah!
In my day, we had fantastical feasts, when I lived in the palace.
And now look at me.
Wasted away to practically nothing.
Banished and exiled and practically starving, while he and his flimsy fish folk celebrate.
Well, I'll give 'em something to celebrate soon enough.
Flotsam! Jetsam!
I want you to keep an extra close watch on this pretty little daughter of his.
She may be the key to Triton's undoing.
I just don't know what we're going to do with you, young lady.
Daddy, I'm sorry. I just forgot.
As a result of your careless behavior...
Careless and reckless behavior!
...the entire celebration was, uh...
Well, it was ruined! That's all!
Completely destroyed!
This concert was to be the pinnacle of my distinguished career.
Now, thanks to you, I am the laughingstock of the entire kingdom!
But it wasn't her fault...
Uh, well, first, uh, the shark chased us.
Yeah, yeah. And we tried to... but we couldn't, and he...
And... And we... Whoa!
And then we were safe.
But then this seagull came, and it was, "This is this..."
Seagull?
What? Oh!
You went up to the surface again, didn't you?
- Didn't you?
- Nothing happened.
Oh, Ariel, how many times must we go through this?
You could have been seen by one of those barbarians, by one of those humans!
- They're not barbarians.
- They are dangerous.
Do you think I want to see my youngest daughter snared by a fish-eater's hook?
I'm 16 years old.
I'm not a child anymore.
Don't you take that tone of voice with me, young lady!
As long as you live under my ocean, you'll obey my rules!
- If you would just listen...
- Not another word!
And I am never... never to hear of you going to the surface again!
Is that clear?
Hmph! Teenagers.
They think they know everything.
You give them an inch, they swim all over you.
Do you think I was too hard on her?
Definitely not.
Why, if Ariel was my daughter,
I'd show her who was boss.
None of this flitting to the surface and other such nonsense.
No, sir. I'd keep her under tight control.
- You're right, Sebastian.
- Of course.
Ariel needs constant supervision.
Someone to watch over her, to keep her out of trouble.
All the time.
And you are just the crab to do it.
How do I get myself into these situations?
I should be writing symphonies, not tagging along after some headstrong teenager.
Hmm? What is that girl up to?
Huh?
Ariel, are you OK?
If only I could make him understand.
I just don't see things the way he does.
I don't see how a world that makes such wonderful things could be bad.

Ariel, what are you...
How could you... What is all this?
It's, uh... It's just my collection.
Oh, I see.
Your collection, hmm.
If your father knew about this place...
You're not gonna tell him, are you?
Oh, please, Sebastian, he would never understand.
Ariel, you're under a lot of pressure down here.
Come with me, I'll take you home and get you something warm to drink.

Ariel?
Ariel, what are you...
Jumpin' jellyfish!
Ariel? Ariel! Please! Come back!
Max! Here, boy!
Hey, come on, mutt.

Come on, Max.
Good boy. Good boy.
Hey there, sweetie! Quite a show, eh?
Scuttle, be quiet. They'll hear you.
Ooh, I got ya. I got ya.
We're bein' intrepidaceous.
We're out to discover!
I've never seen a human this close before.
Oh. He's very handsome, isn't he?
I don't know. He looks kind of hairy and slobbery to me.
Not that one.
The one playing the snarfblatt.
Silence, silence.
It is now my honor and privilege to present our esteemed Prince Eric with a very special, very expensive, very large birthday present.
Ah, Grimsby, ya old beanpole, you shouldn't have.
I know.
Happy birthday, Eric.
Uh, gee, Grim... Ha!
It's, uh... It's really somethin'.
Yes, I commissioned it myself.
Of course, I had hoped it would be a wedding present.
Come on, Grim. Don't start.
You're not still sore because I didn't fall for the princess of Glowerhaven?
Oh, my! Oh, Eric, it isn't me alone.
The entire kingdom wants to see you happily settled with the right girl.
Oh, she's out there somewhere. I just...
I just haven't found her yet.
Perhaps you haven't been looking hard enough.
Believe me, Grim, when I find her, I'll know.
Without a doubt, it'll just... bam... hit me, like lightning.
Hurricane a-comin'!
Stand fast! Secure the riggin'!
Whoa! The wind's all of a sudden on the move here! Yo!
Ariel!
Look out!
Grim! Hang on!
Max!
Jump, Max!
Come on, boy! Jump! You can do it, Max!
Eric!
Is he... dead?
It's hard to say.
Oh, I... I can't make out a heartbeat.
No, look! He's breathing.
He's so beautiful.

And not just any human. A prince!
Her daddy will love that.
King Triton's headstrong, lovesick girl would make a charming addition to my little garden.
Ariel dear, time to come out.
You've been in there all morning.
What is with her lately?
- Oh. Morning, Daddy.
- Well!
- Oh, she's got it bad.
- What? What has she got?
Isn't it obvious, Daddy?
Ariel's in love.
Ariel? In love?
OK. So far, so good.
I don't think the king knows.
But it will not be easy keeping something like this a secret for long.
He loves me.
Mmm. He loves me not.
He loves me! I knew it!
Ariel, stop talking crazy!
I gotta see him again... tonight.
- Scuttle knows where he lives.
- Ariel, please!
Will you get your head out of the clouds and back in the water where it belongs?
I'll swim to his castle, then Flounder will splash around to get his attention.
- And then we'll go...
- Down here is your home!

Ariel?
Oh, somebody's got to nail that girl's fins to the floor.
Sebastian!
Sebastian, I've been looking all over for you.
I've got an urgent message from the sea king.
The sea king?
He wants to see you right away.
Something about Ariel.
Oh, he knows!
Hey, let's see now.
Oh, who could the lucky merman be?
Come in, Sebastian.
I mustn't overreact.
I must remain calm.
Yes?
- Yes, Your Majesty?
- Sebastian.
I'm concerned about Ariel.
Have you noticed she's been acting peculiar lately?
- Oh! Uh, peculiar?
- You know, mooning about.
Daydreaming, singing to herself.
You haven't noticed, hmm?
Oh, well, I...
- Sebastian?
- Hmm?
I know you've been keeping something from me.
Keeping something?
About Ariel?
- Ariel?
- In love, hmm?
I tried to stop her, sir!
She wouldn't listen!
I told her to stay away from humans!
They are bad!
- They are trouble!
- Humans? What about humans?
Humans?
Who said anything about humans?
Flounder, why can't you just tell me what this is all about?
Flounder, why can't you just tell me what this is all about?
You'll see. It's a surprise.
Oh, Flounder.
Flounder, you're the best!
It looks just like him.
It even has his eyes.
Why, Eric, run away with you?
Oh, this is all so... so sudden.
Daddy?
I consider myself a reasonable merman.
I set certain rules, and I expect those rules to be obeyed.
But, Dad, I...
Is it true you rescued a human from drowning?
I had to...
Contact between the human world and the mer world is strictly forbidden.
Ariel, you know that!
Everyone knows that.
- He would have died.
- One less human to worry about.
- You don't even know him.
- Know him?
I don't have to know him!
They're all the same.
Spineless, savage, harpooning fish-eaters incapable of any feeling...
Daddy, I love him!
No! Have you lost your senses completely?
He's a human. You're a mermaid.
I don't care.
So help me, Ariel,
I am going to get through to you.
And if this is the only way, so be it!
Daddy! No!
No! Please!
Daddy, stop! Daddy, stop it!
Daddy, no!
Ariel, I...
Just go away.
Poor child. Poor, sweet child.
She has a very serious problem.
If only there were something we could do.
But there is something.
Who... Who are you?
Don't be scared.
We represent someone who can help you.
Someone who can make all your dreams come true.
Just imagine...
You and your prince...
Together forever.
I don't understand.
Ursula has great powers.
The sea witch?
Why, that's... I couldn't possibly.
No! Get out of here. Leave me alone!
Suit yourself.
It was only a suggestion.
Wait.
Yes?
- Poor Ariel.
- I didn't mean to tell.
It was an accident.
Ariel? Where are you going?
Ariel, what are you doing here with this riffraff?
I'm going to see Ursula.
Ariel, no! No!
She's a demon. She's a monster.
Why don't you go tell my father?
You're good at that.
But... But, I... Come on!
This way.
Come in. Come in, my child.
We mustn't lurk in doorways. It's rude.
One might question your upbringing.
Now, then, you're here because you have a thing for this human, this prince fellow.
Not that I blame you.
He is quite a catch, isn't he?
Well, angelfish, the solution to your problem is simple.
The only way to get what you want is to become a human yourself.
Can you do that?
My dear, sweet child. That's what I do.
It's what I live for.
To help unfortunate merfolk, like yourself, poor souls with no one else to turn to.

Now, here's the deal.
I will make you a potion that will turn you into a human for three days.
Got that? Three days.
Now, listen, this is important.
Before the sun sets on the third day, you've got to get dear old princie to fall in love with you.
That is, he's got to kiss you.
Not just any kiss, the kiss of true love.
If he does kiss you before the sun sets on the third day, you'll remain human permanently.
But if he doesn't, you'll turn back into a mermaid... and... you belong to me!
No, Ariel!
Have we got a deal?
If I become human,
I'll never be with my father or sisters again.
That's right!
But you'll have your man.
Life's full of tough choices, isn't it?
Oh! And there is one more thing.
We haven't discussed the subject of payment.
You can't get something for nothing.
- But I don't have any...
- I'm not asking much.
Just a token really, a trifle.
You'll never even miss it.
What I want from you is... your voice.
- My voice?
- You've got it, sweetcakes.
No more talking, singing. Zip!
But without my voice, how can I...
You'll have your looks, your pretty face.
And don't underestimate the importance of body language!

There's somethin' different.
Don't tell me.
I got it. It's your hairdo, right?
You've been usin' the dinglehopper?
No? No, huh? Well, let me see.
New seashells?
No new seashells.
I gotta admit I can't put my foot on it right now.
If I stand here long enough...
She's got legs, you idiot!
She traded her voice to the sea witch and got legs. Geez, man!
I knew that.
Ariel's been turned into a human.
She's gotta make the prince fall in love with her, and he's gotta kiss her.
And she's only got three days!
Just look at her!
On legs! On human legs!
My nerves are shot!
This is a catastrophe!
What would her father say?
I'll tell you what her father'd say.
He'd say he's gonna kill himself a crab!
That's what he'd say!
I'm gonna march meself straight home right now and tell him just like I should have done the minute...
And don't you shake your head at me, young lady.
Maybe there's still time.
If we could get that witch to give you back your voice, you could go home with all the normal fish and just be...
Just be...
Just be miserable for the rest of your life.
All right, all right.
I'll try to help ya find that prince.
Boy, what a soft shell
I'm turning out to be.
Now, Ariel, I'm telling ya.
If you wanna be a human, the first thing to do is dress like one. Let me see.
Max? What?
Huh? What? Max!
Ya look great, kid.
Ya look sensational.
Max!
Max!
Quiet, Max.
What's gotten into you, fella? Oh.
Oh, I see.
Are you OK, miss?
I'm sorry if this knucklehead scared you.
He's harmless really, uh...
You seem very familiar to me.
Have we met?
We have met. I knew it.
You're the one, the one I've been looking for.
What's your name?
What's wrong? What is it?
You can't speak? Oh!
Oh, then you couldn't be who I thought.
What is it? You're hurt?
No, no. You need help?
Whoa, whoa, careful! Careful, easy.
Gee, you must have really been through something.
Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll help you.
Come on. Come on. You'll be OK.
Washed up from a shipwreck.
Oh, the poor thing.
We'll have you feeling better in no time.
I'll just... I'll just get this washed for you.
Well, you must have at least heard about this girl.
- No!
- Gertrude says...
When has Gertrude ever gotten anything right?
- Really.
- Madam, please...
She shows up in rags and doesn't speak.
Not my idea of a princess.
If Eric's looking for a girl,
I know a couple of highly available ones right here.
Oh, Eric, be reasonable.
Oh, Eric, be reasonable.
Nice young ladies just don't swim around rescuing people in the middle of the ocean and then flitter off into oblivion...

Uh, do you like it?
It is rather a fine one.
Oh, my.

This has got to be, without a doubt, the single most humiliating day of my life.
I hope that you appreciate what I go through for you, young lady.
Now, we got to make a plan to get that boy to kiss you.
Tomorrow when he takes you for that ride, you gotta look your best.
You gotta bat your eyes, like this.
You gotta pucker up your lips, like this.
Hmm.
You are hopeless, child. You know that?
Completely hopeless.
Any sign of them?
No, Your Majesty.
We searched everywhere.
We've found no trace of your daughter or Sebastian.
Keep looking. Leave no shell unturned, no coral unexplored.
Let no one in this kingdom sleep until she's safe at home.
Yes, sire.
Oh, what have I done?
What have I done?
Has he kissed her yet?
- Not yet.
- Oh!
Oh, Judy!
Yo! Flounder! Any kissing?
No, not yet.
Well, they'd better get crackin'!
Move over.
Move your big feathers.
I can't see a thing.
Nothing is happening.
Only one day left, and that boy ain't puckered up once.
OK. All right, this calls for a little vocal romantic stimulation.
Stand back!
Wa, wa, wa, wa-wa!
Wow. Somebody should find that poor animal and put it out of its misery.
Wa, wa, wa-wa!
Wa, wa, wa, wa-wa!
Geez, man. I'm surrounded by amateurs.
Wa, wa, wa, wa!

That was a close one. Too close.
That was a close one. Too close.
The little tramp!
Ah, she's better than I thought.
Well, at this rate, he'll be kissing her by sunset for sure.
Well, it's time Ursula took matters into her own tentacles.
Triton's daughter will be mine!
And then I'll make him writhe.
I'll see him wriggle like a worm on a hook!
Eric? If I may say, far better than any dream girl is one of flesh and blood, one warm and caring and right before your eyes.
Ariel!
Ariel, wake up! Wake up.
I just heard the news. Congratulations.
Kiddo, we did it!
What is this idiot babbling about?
Right, as if you two didn't know, huh?
The whole town's buzzin' about the prince gettin' hitched this afternoon!
You know, he's getting married.
You silly side-walker.
I just wanted to wish ya luck.
I'll catch ya later. I wouldn't miss it!
Well, now, Eric.
It appears that I was mistaken.
This mystery maiden of yours does, in fact, exist.
A-And she is lovely.
Congratulations, my dear.
We wish to be married as soon as possible.
Oh, yes, of course, Eric, but, uh, these things do take time, you know.
This afternoon, Grimsby.
The wedding ship departs at sunset.
Oh. Oh. Very well, Eric, uh, as you wish.

The sea witch! Oh, no!
She's gonna... I gotta...
Ariel!
Ariel!
Ariel, I was flying...
Of course, I was flying. And...
I saw the... the watch...
The witch was watching the mirror, and she was singin' with a stolen set of pipes.
Do you hear what I'm tellin' you?
The prince is marrying the sea witch in disguise!
- Are you sure about this?
- Have I ever been wrong?
I mean, when it's important?
What are we gonna do?
Before the sun sets on the third day.
Day...
Ariel, grab onto that.
Flounder, get her to that boat as fast as your fins can carry you.
I'll try!
I gotta get to the sea king.
He must know about this.
- What about me? What about me?
- You!
Find a way to stall that wedding!
Stall the wedding. W-What am I?
What? That's it!
Let's go!
We got an emergency here.
Dearly beloved...
Don't worry, Ariel.
We're gonna make it.
We're almost there.
Yes, um, do you, Eric, take Vanessa... to be your lawfully wedded wife for as long as you both shall live?
I do.
It being... And do you...
Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Then by the power...
Get away, you slimy...
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, why, you little...
Huh?
Ariel?
Eric.
You... You can talk?
- You're the one.
- Eric, get away from her.
- It was you all the time.
- Eric, I wanted to tell you.
Eric, no!
You're too late!
You're too late!
So long, lover boy.
- Ariel!
- Poor little princess.
It's not you I'm after.
I've a much bigger fish to...
- Ursula, stop!
- Hmph!
Why, King Triton!
How are you?
- Let her go!
- Not a chance! She's mine now!
- We made a deal.
- Daddy, I'm sorry! I-I...
I didn't mean to! I didn't know!
You see?
The contract's legal, binding and completely unbreakable, even for you.
Of course, I always was a girl with an eye for a bargain.
The daughter of the great sea king is a very precious commodity.
But I might be willing to make an exchange for someone even better.
Eric, what are you doing?
Grim, I lost her once.
I'm not gonna lose her again!
Now, do we have a deal?
Ha! It's done then!
No! Oh, no!
Your Majesty.
Daddy.
- At last... it's mine.
- No.
You!
You monster!
Don't fool with me, ya little brat!
Contract or no, I'll blast... Ow!
- Why, you little fool.
- Eric! Eric, look out!
After him!
Come on!
Ow!
Say goodbye to your sweetheart.
Babies! My poor little poopsies.
Eric, you've gotta get away from here.
No, I won't leave you.
You pitiful, insignificant fools!
Look out!
Now I am the ruler of all the ocean!
The waves obey my every whim!
Eric!
The sea and all its spoils bow to my power!
Eric!
Oh! Oh!
So much for true love!
She really does love him, doesn't she, Sebastian?
Mmm. Well, it's like
I always say, Your Majesty, children got to be free to lead their own lives.
You always say that?
Then I guess there's just one problem left.
And what's that, Your Majesty?
How much I'm going to miss her.
Ah-ha!
Yes!
Thank you. Thank you.
I love you, Daddy.

I don't care
If he's a clerk or just a millionaire
There's no doubt about it
I'll sing, and I'll shout it
'Case I don't care
When it comes to happiness
I want my share
Don't try to rearrange me
There's nothing can change me
'Cause
It looks very bad.
Leo, I ain't no stage singer.
So I'm not loud enough for you.
All right, so I get up on the stage occasionally...
Get out of here... towards the end ot the evening.
Granted the old box ain't what it used to be... but no dancing horses!
And now you expect me to hobble into 60 joints tonight?
I can't even get the chorus slips out.
I wonder how they'd like it if l...
Kid, come here. Wanna make a penny?
Any more kids standing around out there?
Hey. He can't come in here without payin'.
- He's goin' right away, Charlie.
- I got my orders. He has to pay.
He'll keep his eyes closed.
He won't see nothin'. His ears closed.
He won't hear nothin', won't breathe nothin', won't do nothin'.
He'II get nothin' of value.
He'll pay nothin'!
Here. Give these out to the clientele. Come on.
Give those to the people, son.
And speedy. These folks gotta sing along with me.
It's rough when they start with "Daisy'' in the midst of "Marie ot Sunny Italy."
Come on. Like this. Come.
Pardon me, tolks.
Chorus slips for the wonderful song the lovely Lily Montgomery... is gonna be introducing in just a tew moments.
So as not to be lett behind at the bridge...
I'm sure you'll want to peruse these in advance.
Waiter! A light here.
No need to worry about the number currently onstage.
Ours is far superior in every way... as I'm sure you'll agree when you hear it, huh?
You'll tind yourself just bursting into song as well.
It don't hurt to swipe the other slips some other bozo might have left behind.
Out of sight, out ot mind, right?
Here. Go.
Come on. Go.
Beggin' your pardon, tolks, chorus slips for a wonderful song... the lovely Lily Montgomery's gonna be introducin' in just a tew minutes.
The kid's a genius.
Louie?
Yeah?
You promised the boy a penny.
A penny?
You ought to be gratetul.
Got a ride in a brand-new car, apple cider... a trip into almost every joint in town.
Nonetheless, you promised.
Promised, huh?
Here.
What's he want with those other chorus slips?
He must be studying the competition.
It wouldn't hurt you.
"It wouldn't hurt," he says.
So why am I crying?
Good night, zunelech.
Maybe we'll see you tomorrow.
Not it I see you tirst.
- Get outta here.
- Hey.
Oh, no. You got your G's all backwards.
Look at that. A whole row of G's backwards. Look.
Little tails go like this and like that.
What are you talkin'?
He's writing Q's.
Perfectly right.
Perfectly okay Q's.
You're writing Q's.
Am I right?
- What are you writing here?
- P's.
- Who taught you to write P's like that?
- The dancing horse.
Who told you to go near the dancing horse? Stay away from the dancing horse.
Good-bye, Mama.
There are smiles
That make us happy
There are smiles
That make us blue
That kid is too old to be playin' juveniles.
Old but little.
He had a stunted youth.
What is this kid to you anyway, Louie?
He comes in and takes your job away.
And he took Louie everyplace he went.
The kid's nothin' to me.
I'm nothin' to him.
It's more than I got elsewhere.
His voice is changin' anyway.
So let it change.
Who says it's gotta change bad?
Maybe it'll change good.
And the smiles that fill my life with sunshine
Are the smiles that you give
To me
- Louie?
- Yeah?
I'm 17 years old.
When's my voice gonna change already?
It's changin'.
I know it's changin'.
When's it gonna change for good?
- What's your rush?
- I don't wanna be a horse's ass torever.
Almie, what's wrong?
So your voice finally changed, huh?
This is a tunny story.
Yeah, we're both laughin', huh?
That's a nice little cough you have there, Zalmie.
A little cough, says Louie.
Consumption he's got.
You ain't laughin'. Well, you ain't laughin' 'cause I ain't finished yet.
You'll know when I'm finished.
Then you'll be laughin'.
It ya ain't, then I'll be cryin'.
That ought to be good for a few laughs.
Either way, you win!
- Come on. Move.
- Shove it, Charlie.
Hey, hurry up.
Come on. Out on stage.
Move it. Let's go, girls.
I just seen the most beautitul thing
I ever seen in the whole world.
Some pre- Prohibition booze, huh?
No. I seen the stripper gettin' dressed.
A stripper gettin' dressed ain't retty unless she's ugly to begin with.
She was not ugly to begin with!
She was like a rose.
A rose?
- How old are you anyhow, kid?
- Almost 20. How old are you?
Not so old.
I know. When we first met,
I thought you were an old man.
Now, older I get, younger you get.
Amazing, ain't it?
Pretty soon we'll be just the same.
Yeah? Then what?
Then we start callin' me " kid.''
You want this girl, kid?
So go get her.
- Right now?
- Right now.
In this business, you wait tive minutes, she'll be older than both of us. Go on.
Somebody loves me
I wonder who
I wonder who it can be
- Hey, you can sing.
- No, I can't.
Sure you can.
I know voices.
I used to be a singer myself.
- With that voice?
- No, not with this voice.
I used to have another voice. I sent it to the laundry. It come back shrunk.
- So you wanna be a singer, huh?
- No.
Sure you do. Singers get to sit on piano and things.
Strippers is always on their feet.
Ain't you always tellin' me how your tootsies is achin'?
That's because you're always steppin' on 'em.
Hey, kid,
I'm gonna make you a star.
So what was Bella betore it was Bella?
Annabella.
Here.
I wanna make the kid a star.
All right?
To make the kid a star, I gotta get to know the clubs and the bands.
It I can get paid for it at the same time, where's the heartache, huh?
The heartache is, you could have been a star yourselt.
You could have been a great comic.
Who wants to laugh sittin' in some speak?
You got one ear cocked for the cops.
They want a slow, sexy woman... helpin' them to feel sorry for themselves.
Comics are for kids.
And besides, Louie, it's the music I love.
It's the music.
I can't even remember the words.
It's gonna be a big song.
I think you should try it again.
You think I'm gonna be a hit?
Did the booze arrive?
Ah, Mr. Palumbo.
How ya doin', Boss?
Hey, baggy pants.
Where's your partner, Zalmie?
He's in the back where he always is.
Yeah, I see him.
Your girl's getting fat.
Pregnant.
Don't you think it's time for a wedding?
How can I ask her?
I don't have a cent.
You should have thought of that betore you got her regnant.
Who thinks at a time like that?
So what do you think? Customers will pay to see some pufted- out singer?
Hey, she ain't any fatter than Sophie Tucker.
Yeah, but she's tat all in one place.
You want the kid, or you want the girl fixed?
We want the kid!
Well, then, go get married.
This is a wholesome place.
Come on, doll!
We got a down payment on rice!
So the booze I understand.
Izzy needs the booze for the nightclubs.
But why's he cuttin' out the middleman?
He cuttin' the middle out of the middleman.
I never seen so much blood in my whole lite.
I don't like this business.
I loved show business.
Yo always told me it was just the music.
And it still is.
And along came Bill
Who's not the kind at all
You meet him on the street
And never notice him
His warm embrace
His manly grace
Is not the kind
I got to admit it, almie.
She's really good.
What do you say, Nicky?
She ain't bad.
- Sometimes it's all worth it, huh?
- Yeah.
That makes me thrill
I love him
Because he's wonderful
What do you think, Benny?
Your mama's gonna make a record.
The kid never talks, almie.
He will when he's got somethin' to say.
How do you know there ain't somethin' wrong with him?
Maybe he's deat?
How can he be deaf?
He plays the piano.
Beethoven was deat.
See that? Garbo talks, huh?
What?
They won't listen to reason.
Nicky, you get the deuce. Izzy, you pull a trick. The whistler with a jig.
Little almie is flushin' out.
All right.
Hey, that kid's got piano player's hands.
Surgeon's hands.
He's going to be a doctor.
Doctor, piano player. He can be both.
He's smart enough.
Here we go. Everyone in?
Almie, you ordered pretzels?
Pretzels?
Yeah. Thought maybe you sent me a present.
But it's a box of pretzels.
Bella, don't touch the box!
So, Benny, I can get you
Reisenweber's.
I can get you Jack's. I can get you
Shanley's. So what are you doin' here?
I'm happy, Pops.
It's not like anybody's doin' you a favor. Everybody knows you're good.
That guy from RCA Victor is dyin' tor you to make a record tor him.
Dyin'?
It's not that important.
Yeah, Benny, it is important!
You could be somethin', Benny.
You could be a star.
I want you to do me a favor, Benny.
I want you to marry a girl for me.
- Marry a girl?
- Yeah.
- And live happily ever atter?
- Yeah.
Hey, Benny, it's Nicky Palumbo's daughter, all right?
Her father's an important man, mister.
And your tather's an important man, too!
Benny, if you won't live my dreams, then live my life, all right?
Sure, Pops.
Now what are you doing?
Playin' her a love song.
Forget the love songs, Benny.
The girl's agreed.
A love song's nice to give the girl you're gonna marry.
It's very clear
Our love is here to stay
Nicky, look at it this way.
You're not losing a daughter.
You're gaining a son.
Right.
Sons I don't need. I got sons.
What I'm gaining is a brother.
The radio
And the telephone
And the movies
That we know
May be just passing fancies
And in time they'll go
Yet it may be
Our love is here to stay
Together
We're
Going the long, long way
It's a big house.
Big.
What are the two ot us supposed to do in this big house?
Make three, tour or tive.
Is that what you want?
If you do.
But what do you want?
I want you to smile.
Enlisted? What do ya mean, ya enlisted?
- I like the hat, Pops.
- You got a wite now.
You got a kid comin'!
So I need a steady job.
What are you talking?
You got a steady job here!
Oh, Pops.
This isn't work. This is play.
Hey, so play, Benny.
You're just a kid.
No, Pops. No, I'm not.
Look, I gave, all right?
I gave at the ottice.
But you took too.
What am I gonna do it anything should happen to you, huh?
You'II manage, Pops.
Boy, who told you you could play that thing?
Nobody.
Boy, are you lousy.
Yeah.
I know, but it's hard to fit a piano in a foxhole.
You've been carrying a torch tor that bastard's son long enough, ya hear?
You married a good man now, you understand?
You don't want to marry in the business, all right, so I let ya.
You wanna marry a guy that sells refrigerators, I let ya.
Could I be proud of that? No.
But I let ya.
So at least be worthy of the man.
You own him now, Papa!
I own everybody.

What is your place of residence?
The Jacksonville State Prison.
Ery nice place.
Tony, come here.
I want him to see this.
I want him to see how a man acts.
What was your relationship with Mr. Palumbo?
My relationship?
- He was my triend.
- Was?
First he told me they'd get me out right away.
Then they told me they'd get me out soon.
Then they told me nothin'.
Eight years is a long time.
I told you we should have gotten rid ot him!
His son gets killed.
He gets totally useless.
But, no, you get mushed tor him.
Let him take a fall, you say, huh?
He'll stay quiet.
Quiet? He would have been a lot quieter dead.
And so now you agreed to talk to us.
This country's been good to me in its way.
"I took," my son said.
So, now it's time to give back.
I can't believe it.
That schmuck is gonna sing!
Sing?
Sure. That's all he ever wanted.
Last night I discussed the Communists in the State Department.
Dean hunched his muscular neck,
T- shirted in the winter night.
We're fighting for time.
The young men in Korea and Japan are fighting for time for us.
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg have paid their debt to society with their lives.
Pat doesn't have a mink coat... but she does have a respectable
Repblican cloth coat.
Ethel, how could you ever think up a sneaky scheme like that?
I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness.
Starving, hysterical, naked, dragging themselves... through the negro streets at dawn lookin' tor an angry fix.
Angel-headed hipsters... burning tor the ancient heavenly connection... to the starry dynamo in the machinery ot night.
Tony, so what's he talkin' about?
Do you have any idea?
Shut up.
Geez, we're underage.
This place could get busted any minute.
And I happen to know some of these people are smokin' drugs.
Shut up!
Instead ot smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water tlats... floating across the tops of cities... contemplating jazz.
- I'm goin', Tony.
- Go.
So how you gonna get home?
Home?

She's bound for glory
If you want to get to heaven
Well, you got to be holy
Hey, Di Noble, what are you doin'?
- Thinkin'.

Clean thoughts.
Then how come my dishes are dirty?
Dirty?
Well, them poor dumb little bastards.
They never learned the power of positive thought.
I thought you said you was a dishwasher.
I'm a dishwasher.
My hands is permanently puckered!
But you know what?
The thrill is gone.
That's what happens when you turn pro.
Even that first batch of suds... that first spraying ot Palmolive over troubled waters... that tirst plunge through the foam... that first hopetul tish for a dish...
It is gone, Charley.
And I think it's time... that I'm movin' on.
Where ya gonna go, Tony?
West!
Where else can a man go that needs elbow room?
And what the hell you need elbow room tor?
I'm thinkin' ot takin' up the accordion.
Hey, you're not gonna make it in this business, Tony.
Ya can't sing.
You play guitar like a duck.
That's 'cause my hands is permanently puckered!
And, anyway, this is Calitornia.
There ain't no turther west to go.
All the leaves are brown
And the sky is gray
I've been for a walk
On a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm
If I was in L.A.
California dreamin'
Hey, man!
Where'd you get that stuff?
From a hobo on a train.
You got some more of it?
That's all he taught me.
Well, come on up anyway.
Hey, come on over and sit down.
Yeah. How ya doin'?
Hey, try some of this.
Did ya ever get high betore?
Only when I can aftord it.
How often is that?
Never.
Hey, you think you can tind that hobo?
You sing?
You play guitar?
Everybody plays guitar, man.
Everybody plays the guitar.
Hey, man, well, what do you do?
- I write songs.

Words or music?
Words. I don't know nothin' about no music.
We can see that.
Why don't you bring some over?
All right!
I got 'em at home.
- Where's that?
- North Beach.
North Beach?
Nobody lives in North Beach anymore.
Nobody lives in North Beach.
Run on out and get 'em.
Bring 'em over.
Yeah, okay. It'll take me a while
'cause I gotta walk.
Walk? You gotta walk?
Take the bus.
All right.
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It'll never do somehow
When the rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason
I'm travelin' on
Don't think twice
It's all right
Oh, where have you been my blue-eyed son
Where have yo been my darling yong one
I've stumbled and I've crawled on six crooked highways
Walked in a...
Oh, come on!
Come on, you guys!
Everything in the world is possible.
And we're just sittin' here doin' nothing.
Frankie, we're doin' tine, honey.
Just tine.
Fine?
I don't wanna hear fine.
You don't make it on fine!
Nobody cares about fine.
Everything's gotta be pertect, and this is our shot.
- It's just one more gig, lady.
- It's not just a gig!
This is our time!
This is our time, guys.
And it's slippin' right through our fingers.
We got any more of this?
Hey, he's working on a song.
I'd like to get this one right first!
You got any more of this?
Sure.
Thanks.
You like to try it again?
Oh, where have you been my blue-eyed son
Where have you been my darling yong one
Words don't fit now.
Fuck the words.
The words don't matter.
Let's do it a little faster.
Where have yo been my blue-eyed son
Where have you been my darling yong one
When the truth is found
When the truth is found
To be lies
You know the joy
Within you dies
Don't you want somebody to love
Don't you need somebody to love
Wouldn't you love somebody to love
Yo better find somebody to love
Love
When the garden flows
Baby, you're dead
Yes, and your mind
Is so full of red
Don't you want somebody to love
Don't yo need somebody to love
Wouldn't yo love somebody to love
Yo better find somebody to love
Your eyes
I say your eyes
May look like his
Well, now in your head, baby
I'm afraid you don't know where it is
Love

Just anything at all, man.
You got any smack?

Yeah, it's pretty bad... pain.
When yo're strange
Faces come out of the rain
When yo're strange
No one remembers your name
Would you like to ride in my beatiful balloon
We can float among the stars together
You and I
All right. I want everybody out ot this studio. I mean it.
Hey, what'd you stop tor?
I was doin' great.
And, Frankie, lay otf that goddamn bottle.

Don't you know I'm nothin' without you?
Purple haze all in my brain

Across the river.
- Kid, what's your name?
- Little Pete.
- Well, who's Big Pete?
- My dad.
What's your dad gonna say about you hangin' out with a bunch ot freaks?
I never met my dad.
He's some kind of mystery.

You could teach me how to do that.
Hey, kid.
Come here.
You gotta sing in a halt hour.
I'm gonna sing now.
Yeah. Sure.

I'm waitin' for my man
Got $20 in my hand
Up to Lexington 125
Feel sick and dirty
I'm waitin' for my man
Hey, white boy what you doin' uptown
Hey, white boy you chasin' my women around
Pardon me, sir it's furthest from my mind
I'm just waitin' for a dear friend of mine
I'm waitin' for my man
Come on
Here he comes
He's all dressed in black
New York shoes and a big straw hat
He's never early
He's always late
First thing you learn is that you always gotta wait
I'm waitin' for my man
I don't know, Tony.
I guess I just don't have it.
You had us livin' at the Chelsea.
I can't even get us the "Y."
Go back to Kansas.
Maybe you could listen to what I'm doin' sometimes.
See what I'm doin' wrong.
Go back to Kansas.
Maybe... you could put some magic on it.
Go back to Kansas.
- I can't.
- Why?
Too tlat.
What the hell is this, the Himalayas?
Everest.
Everybody's gotta take a shot at it.
Gimme your guitar.
You're gonna play it?
No. I'm gonna pawn it.
I'm gonna pawn it, then I'm gonna un-pawn it.
You don't trust me?
Then why do you stay with me?
Why the hell do you think?
Here.
It belonged to my father.
Now I'm givin' it to you.
- Why?
- Why the hell do you think?
His name was Benny Belinsky.
I never knew him.
Supposed to be some kind ot genius or something.
Maybe you take atter him.
Now give me the guitar.
Now you stay right there, you hear?
Till hell freezes over, Tony.
It already did.
Hey, you Little Pete?
Yeah.
Well, I got somethin' tor you.
He said not to sell it all in one place.
And he said to give you this.
Did he tell you anything else?
No... Yeah!
He said to say " Good-bye.''
Hell
Hell is for children
And you know that their little lives can become such a mess
Hell
Hell is for children
And you shouldn't have to pay for your love with your bones and your flesh
Hell is for children
Hell is for hell
Hell is for children
There's no point in asking
You'll get no reply
I'm just getting in bt I barely try
I got no reason to know too much
You'll always find us
Out to lunch
We're so pretty
Oh, so pretty
We're vacant
Don't ask us what we're doin'
'cause we're not aware
I don't pretend
'cause I don't care
I don't believe illusions
I got too much for real
Stop your cheap comment
'Cause we know what we feel
I know
And we don't care
There's no point in asking
You'll get no reply
I just get in but I barely try
I got no reason to know too much
You'll always find me
Out to lunch
I know
And we don't care

Pass them out, turkey.
Hey, don't wanna hurt yourself.
I was a little too tall
Could have used a few pounds
Tight pants, points
Hardly renown
She was a black-haired beauty with big, dark eyes
And points all her own sittin' way p high
Way up firm and high
Out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy
Out in the backseat of my '60 Chevy
Workin' on mysteries without any clues
Workin' on the night moves
Tryin' to make some front-page drive-in news
Workin' on the night moves
One for the money
Two for the show
Three to get ready
Now go, cat, go
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes
Well, you can knock me down step on my face
Slander my name all over the place
Do anything that you wanna do
But, uh-uh, honey lay off of my shoes
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Well, yo can do anything but lay off of my blue sede shoes
All right!
Devil with the blue dress on
Crazy
Crazy on you
Let me get crazy on you
Crazy
On you
All right
Let me get crazy on you
Now, it's always
once upon a time
in New York City
It's a big old, bad old
Tough old town it's true
But beginnings
are contagious there
They're always
settin'stages there
They're always turnin'
pages there for you.
Ain't it great the
way it all begins
- In New York City
- Let me have one. Please.
Right away
you're makin'time
And makin'friends.
No one cares
where you were yesterday
If they pick you out
you're on your way
To a once upon a time
That never ends
So, Oliver
don't be shy
Get out there
and go and try
Believin'that
you're the guy
They're dyin'to see
'Cause a dream's no crime
Now, once upon a time
Once upon a time
in New York City
If it's always
once upon a time
in New York City
Why does nightfall find
ya feelin'so alone
How could anyone
stay starry-eyed
When it's rainin'
cats and dogs outside
And the rain is saying
"Now you're on your own"
So, Oliver
don't be scared
Though yesterday
no one cared
They're gettin'
your place prepared
Where you wanna be
Keep your dream alive
Dreamin'is still
how the strong survive
Once upon a time
in New York City
Keep your dream alive
Dreamin'is still
how the strong survive
Once upon a time
in New York City
Keep your dream alive
Dreamin'is still
how the strong survive
Once upon a time
in New York City
And it's always
once upon a time
in New York City
- Forty seconds.
- All right. Here we go.
You see the feet walkin'down
the street in the fast lane
Walkin'on the street
Where they goin'
Just makin'a move
Tryin'to survive
Find a way or not
to stay alive
Cool cat in a cruel world knows
good from bad his mind is in a twirl
Got to look out
and open your eyes
And if you're in a jam
You got to realize
You're in the fast lane
Wait, wait, wait
Wait a minute
- In the fast lane
- Wait, wait, wait
- Hi. Sorry I'm late.
- That's all right.
Come on, sweetheart.
We're late.
You can play with the kitty some other time, honey. Come on.
Hey, 'scusa me. Don't you see
I'm pushing something here? Thank you.
Hey, come on, folks. Step right up. Get your hot dogs.
The best hot dogs in New York.
Hey, it's a beautiful day, eh?
Come on, folks. Step right up.
Hey. Go on. Get outta here.
Shoo! Get outta here. Go on, kitty.
Get your sausages. All right, let's go, folks.
Step right up. I got the hottest dogs in the Big Apple!
- Hiya.
- Ah... Hmph!
- Ooh. La-de-dah.
- Hey! Hey, get off of me.
- What's the matter with you?
Hey! I said get outta here.
- Well, well.
Looks like Louie's got a visitor.
Could be time for the Dodge to turn this into a total cat-astrophe.
Hey! Get off me! Hey!
Get outta here. Go on! Shoo!
Ooh, you sure picked the wrong guy to get hot dogs from, kid.
- G-Get away from me!
- Whoa! Chill out, man!
I don't eat cats.
It's too much fur.
I've been watching you, and I think you're in serious need of some professional guidance.
Now what do ya say we team up and change old Louie's mind... about sharin' some of those hot dogs?
I'm not goin' back there again.
Hey. Be a snap, kid.
I'm an expert at these things.
All you gotta do is learn some moves.
- Moves?
- You know. Tempo.
Ooo-cha-ba. A rhythm. This city's got a beat. You gotta hook into it.
And once you got the beat, you can do anything.
- I can?
- "Absitively posolutely."
The man you see before you is affectionately known as "Old Louie."
A well-known enemy of the four-legged world.
Our mission, cat, is to liberate those all-beef kosher franks and hightail it outta here.
- Startin' to feel that rhythm?
- Well, uh...
Yeah! Yeah! I do feel it!
- When are we gonna get those hot dogs?
- Right now.
Hey! Dog!
Hey! Get outta here, you... Hey!
Hey! Hey! Get outta there! I'll get you!
Go on! Get outta here!
Hey, you really got that rhythm, kid.
Uh, yeah?
We were good, huh?
So when are we gonna eat?
- We?
- Yeah. I'm starvin'.
Listen, kid.
I hate to break it to ya,
- but the dynamic duo is now the dynamic uno.
- What do ya mean?
What I mean is, our partnership is herewith dissolved.
But wait! Wait.
You're not being fair.
Fairs are for tourists, kid. Consider it a free lesson in street savoir faire... from New York's coolest quadruped. Check ya later.
Hey, wait! I helped you get those.
Half of those are mine!
Ya want 'em?
Come and get 'em.
- Uh-huh
- But I'm warnin' ya, kid.
One minute
I'm in Central Park
- Then I'm down on Delancey Street
- What the... Hey!
Say, from the Bowery
to St. Mark's, huh
There's a syncopated beat
Like, I said
Woo-hoo
Whoo-hoo-oo
I'm street wise
I can improvise
Said, ooo-hoo
Woo-hoo-oo
I'm street smart
I've got New York City heart
Why should I worry
Why should I care
I may not have a dime
But I got street savoir faire
Why should I worry
Why should I care
It's just a be-bopulation
I got street savoir faire
Mm-hmm
The rhythm of the city
Boy, once you get it down
Said, you can own this town
You can wear the crown
Why should I worry
Tell me, why should I care
Say, I may not
have a dime
Oh, but I got
street savoir faire
Why should I worry
Why should I care
It's just a doo-wopulation
and I got street savoir faire
Everything goes
Everything fits
They love me at the Chelsea
They adore me at the Ritz
Why should I worry
Why should I care
And even when
I cross that line
I got street savoir faire
Woo-hoo-oo
Hoo-hoo
- Said, ooo-ooo, woo-hoo-oo
- Whoa! Come back here, boy.
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo-oo
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo-oo
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo-oo
Now, come on. Where are you goin'?
Where are you goin'?
Come on, come on. No, no!
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo-oo
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo-oo
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo-oo
Woo-hoo
Wooo-hoo-oo
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo-oo
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo-oo
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo-oo
Huh?
Tito, stop that racket.
I'm trying to watch this show.
There would have been
a time for such a word.
Oh, tomorrow, tomorrow,
and tomorrow creeps...
in this petty pace from
day to day, and all...
- our yesterdays have lighted
fools the way to dusty death.
- Hey, Frankie, man. Whatcha watchin', man?
Hey, does he get the girl?
I mean, what happens?
- Shut up, you little rodent.
- Hey, man, this stuff is boring, man.
Come on. Let's watch some boxing, man.
I want to see some action.
Hey, Frankie. ż Qué pasó, man?
You're getting slow, man.
My name is Francis.
Fran-cis. Not Frank.
Not Frankie. Francis.
No kidding, man? Hey, so what did you bring in today, "Frahn-cees"?
- It's none of your business, you intrusive little pipsqueak.
- Look what I got.
Oh, good show, Einstein. Now all we need is the court and the net.
You think this place is big enough?
Hey, come on. What we need is some good quality stuff, man.
- Check it out.
- Oh, shredded leather.
Shredded wha... What you talkin' about, man? That's a primo wallet, man.
- Rubbish, you mean.
- All right, that does it, Frankie, man!
You insulted my pride!
That means death!
- Behold. The runt of the litter.
- Frankie! Frankie, Frankie,
- Cut it out,
- you two.
- Frankie, Frankie, Frankie!
Fagin's not gonna be too happy about this. So, Francis, you got the food, right?
- Uh, well, no. l...
- Whoa,
- Frankie. It was your turn to get the food today.
- Frankie!
- Oh, Frankie!
It's newspaper burritos again!
Hey, whoa, whoa.
Cool it, Dodger fans.
I'd like to introduce you to your dinner.
- Hot dogs, ŕ la Dodger.
- Hot dogs! All right, Dodger man!
You remain our preeminent benefactor.
Yeah. And you're okay, too.
So how'd ya do it this time, Dodgie baby?
Lemme tell ya, Rita. It was tough.
Only I could have done it.
Did you have to fight, man?
Huh? Huh? I mean, did you fight?
- I mean, how many were there, man?
- Picture the city.
8th and Broadway.
The crowds hustling.
The traffic roaring.
The hot dogs are sizzling.
I love a story with food in it.
Enter Dodger.
One bad puppy.
Not just out for himself; but community-minded.
But he's not the only one out there.
Enter the opposition.
A greedy, ugly, psychotic monster... with razor-sharp claws, dripping fangs, and nine lives, all of them hungry.
He comes at me, eyes burning.
I knew my time had come.
- Suddenly...
- Gang war! Gang war!
- Watch out! Here comes a gang war!
- Take cover!
Guys, okay, watch out!
Well? What is it?
Hey, man, check it out, huh?
Ay, it's a alien!
Cool it, guys.
It's just a cat.
Now, how'd you find this place, cat? l... l... I followed this dog.
- He's lyin'! He's lyin'!
He's lyin'! He's lyin'!
- Shut up, Tito.
- Why would a cat follow a dog?
- Yeah. l-I just wanted some of the sausage that I helped him get.
He's a spy, man. Come on, let's eat him.
You're dead meat, kitty.
I me... S...
I saw him come down.
Hey! That's... Hey, that's him! O-Over there!
Hey, kitty, what took you so long?
Relax, kid.
Dodger, razor-sharp claws?
- Dripping fangs?
- I kind of like those burning eyes.
Hey, keep it down, guys. The game's on.
Oh, boy, Dodger. Top dog has to get help from a cat.
Hey, Tito, cool it, man.
- Come on. Let's see this big, bad kitty fight in action.
- Hey, Tito, look!
Oh, boy! Dog pile!
Oh, what a bunch of overgrown...
- Get off.
- All right. That's it.
Quit biting.
All right, all right, knock it off! Enough!
What's the matter with you guys?
Don't you understand? Sykes will be here any minute, and I don't have his m...
No, no, no, no, no!
No, no. Stop it.
No. No.
No licking.
What a joke! All right, settle down. It's Sykes!
All right, all right.
I'm coming.
I'll be right there. You guys, listen. Don't let me down.
Whaddya got?
Let's see what you got.
It's worthless!
What have you done?
Oh, how are we ever going to pay Sykes off with a... a pussycat?
Oh. Look who's here, kids.
Company. Nice doggies.
I was just on my way out.
You guys miss us?
Mr Sykes, I, uh... l... l...
He's gonna kill me.
Oh! Hello.
Oh, lovely evening.
I was just saying this to your two lovely,
- purebred Dobermans.
- The money, Fagin.
Actually, I've got something much better than money.
Some luxury items that should make a considerable dent in my debt to you.
Oh, my! You waxed your car, didn't you?
Uh, did they use the buffer on this, because I can see myself.
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
I don't want your garbage, Fagin!
Oh, please, Sykes. Oh, please.
Oh, please, I beg you.
I don't think you grasp... the severity of the situation.
Oh, no! Oh, no, no!
I did grasp it.
This is how I grasp. Look.
Accident.
Accident!
- Mr Fagin!
- Sorry.
Now, I lent you money and I don't see it.
Do you know what happens when
I don't see my money, Fagin?
People get hurt.
People like you get hurt.
Do I make myself clear?
Clear. Perfectly clear.
Ya know, Rita,
I can't figure out... why you'd rather hang around a dump like this... when you could be living uptown with a class act like myself.
Isn't it rather dangerous to use one's entire vocabulary in a single sentence?
Hey, Frankie, get down, brother. You bad, man.
- Hey, you got something to say to me, fat boy?
- We... Eh, a-actually...
Come on, man. You guys don't scare me.
Come on. I'll kill you both, man.
Come on, let me at 'em!
I'll kill 'em, I'll kill 'em! Come on!
Go ahead. Let him go.
Why don't you pick on someone your own size?
- Like you, old man?
- Hey, Roscoe.
Roscoe, is this us losing our sense of humour?
Nah. I ain't lost my sense of humour.
See? I find that funny.
Oh, please. Oh, please. Oh, please!
Three sunrises.
Three sunsets.
Three days, Fagin.
Three sunrises.
Three sunsets.
Three days. Three, three, three. That's nine.
- Nine?
- No, Fagin.
- Three.
- Three!
Oh, you mean, just three days?
Oh, my goodness! Oh!
Oh, I'm having a bad day!
Hey, hey, Roscoe.
Look what I found.
Forget it, DeSoto.
We gotta go.
I like cats.
I like to eat 'em.
Get out of my way, Dodger.
That's enough, Roscoe.
Run along, Roscoe.
Your master's calling.
No.
Come on, DeSoto.
We ain't finished, Dodger.
You guys are gonna pay for this.
Starting with that cat.
Oh, yeah! You guys don't scare me!
Come on back and say it to my face!
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
Yeah, those creeps'll think twice before hassling us, man.
All right, kid.
What'd I tell you guys?
OI' Dodge can really pick 'em, huh?
Ooh, three days.
How am I ever gonna come up with all that money?
What's the use? I'll never get out from under that maniac.
My days are numbered.
And the number is three.
It's hopeless.
Thanks, guys.
That reminds me. I saw
DeSoto's nose. Who did that?
You? You.
That took a lot of guts.
We've never had a cat in the gang before.
We can use all the help we can get.
All right. Time for bed.
We've got a big day tomorrow.
Aww, no. No.
Oh, all right.
But just one chapter tonight.
Umm, let's see.
Here we are. Here we are. Chapter seven.
"Sparky stopped and he rolled in a field of wild flowers.
"The dandelions tickled his nose till he laughed out loud.
"And then, something caught his eye.
"It was Bumper the rabbit.
Sparky jumped to his feet and ran toward Bumper, barking loudly."
Woof. Woof.
Well, you try it sometime.
Well, that's because you're a dog.
"Sparky knew that Bumper would run and that he could chase him over the field.
But Sparky would never catch him or hurt him because Sparky was not that kind of dog."
This is the big one.
We've got two days to do or die.
Dodger, you keep an eye on the new kid. Show him the ropes.
I don't want to put any undue pressure on you, but, but... as you march off to do your duty,
I want you to keep one thing in mind:
Dead men do not buy dog food!
So, big smiles and get out there... and fetch!
All right, if Mr Sykes don't see some cold, hard cash soon, we are Doberman chow. Come on.
We'll start on
Columbus Avenue.
- What kind of work do we do, anyway?
- Investment banking, man.
Didn't you read about us in the Wall Street Journal?
- Really?
- Yes. Captains of industry.
Gosh. Can I be one too?
- Hey. When you got your pals, you got all you need.
- Okay, Dodge.
We gotta clean you up, child, and give you some on-the-job training.
Ooo, yeah
Now listen up
You got a lot to learn
And if you don't learn
you don't eat
But if you're tough
and always use your head
You'll be right at home
on the street
When you got talent
everything is free
Watch how we do things
Ooo, I guarantee
You're gonna see how
the best survive
We make an art out
of staying alive
If you do just
as you're told
These are
streets of gold
Every boulevard is
a miracle mile
You'll take the town and
you'll take it with style
If you play it
brave and bold
These are streets of gold
Hello. What have we here?
All right! A chauffeur shuffle.
- Listen up. Einstein, give me a fender bender at two lights.
- Yeah.
Tito? You're in charge of electronics.
Rita and I'll work the crowd. Francis?
I know. My public awaits.
- Hey, but what about me? What do I do?
- You help Tito.
All right! Come on, gato. Hey,
Uncle Tito will show you how it's done.
- Hey, come on, come on, come on, come on!
- Ready? Go!
Oh, Winston, listen to this.
"After a little sightseeing, we left Paris by car... for the con... confer-er..."
- Conference, Jennifer.
- Oh, yes. Conference.
"in-in Rome on Wednesday.
Jenny, I'm afraid your father and I won't be able to make it..."
Is there anything wrong, Jenny?
- Are your parents all right?
- They're staying longer.
Oh, don't worry. Um... l-I'm sure they'll be home for your birthday.
No.
- Oh!
- What was that?
I d... I don't know. But, uh, now, do-don't be alarmed.
- I'll be right back.
- Run, Sparky. Go find Bumper.
Why me?
Today of all days.
Hey. Check it out, man. Beep beep.
Hey, Forget Fagin, man.
Let's take this baby to Atlantic City.
What have I done?
Poor thing.
- You oughta be ashamed of yourself.
- l-l-I'm sure he's just fine.
- Harming that...
- poor animal.
- Probably just a little stunned.
Run along, little fellow.
Go on, now. Shoo.
- Hey, hey, Tito. What can I do?
- Well, uh...
Why don't you be a lookout, man? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it. Be a lookout.
Okay. Uh, what is a lookout?
Look, j-just look out the window.
Make sure it's still daylight, okay?
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, Tito. Tito, there's somethin' back there.
Hey, stop hasslin' me, man.
I only got one more wire, okay?
But... B-But... Oh!
What's going on here?
Let's get outta here!
Oh, you poor kitty.
Here. Let me help you.
Na... Jenny are you all right?
Where's the kid?
He must still be in the car, man!
- Oh, that poor little kid.
- You were supposed to keep an eye on him, Tito!
Yeah, well, it's hard to watch anything when you're gettin' barbecued, man.
- What are we gonna do, Dodge?
- Tito, come with me.
The rest of you, we...
Get back to Fagin.
Now, really, Jenny. W-We-We can't just take in a stray off the street.
But look at the poor thing.
Winston, he's half-starved.
I know you're growing attached to the little fellow, but t... do try to understand.
Your parents left me responsible for you.
They won't mind.
Really.
Don't worry, kitty.
I'll take care of you.
Georgette is not going to like this.
Rise and shine, Georgette.
Your public awaits.
Girl, we got work to do
Pass me the paint
And glue
Perfect isn't easy
But it's
Me
When one knows
the world is watching
One does what one must
Some minor adjustments, darling
Not for my vanity
But for humanity
Each little step
a pose
See how the breeding shows
Sometimes it's too much
For even me
But when all the world says yes
Then who am I to say no
Don't ask a mutt to strut
like a showgirl
No, girl, ya need a pro
Not a flea or a flaw
Take a peek at that paw
La-de-da-da
Perfection becomes me n'est-ce pas?
Unrivalled
Unruffled
I'm beauty unleashed
Yeah
Jaws drop
Hearts stop
So classic and classy
We're not talkin'Lassie
And Aaa
Aaa
Ooo
Ooo
Though many covet
my bone and bowl
They're barkin'up
the wrong tree
You pretty pups
all over the city
I have your hearts
and you have my pity
Pretty is nice
but still it's just pretty
Perfect, my dears
Is me
Wait till you taste this.
It's a secret recipe
I just invented.
What on earth?
My goodness! Jenny!
D-Don't you think a tin of kitty chow would have sufficed?
Nonsense. He'll love this.
Eh, now, young lady.
D... I really think we should've waited until your parents...
- Oh, bother!
- And for ze kitty, the house specialty.
Oeufs a la Jenny
avant Cocoa Krispies.
- Jenny! It's your parents!
- Yeah! Wait till I tell 'em!
Oh, yes, sir. I do assure you, everything is absolutely hunky...
Georgette, I wouldn't go in there if I were you.
- Uh, everything's fine here, sir.
- They're gonna be so excited.
H-Here she is now.
A cat! What is the meaning of this?
Winston!
I guess I'll have to handle this myself.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I, um, hope you won't think me rude, but do you happen to know... out of whose bowl you're eating?
- Yours?
- Ooh.
Aren't you a clever kitty?
And do you have any idea whose home this is?
I thought it was Jenny's.
Well, it may be
Jenny's house, but everything from the doorknobs down is mine!
Oh, Georgette! I see you met
Oliver. Isn't he cute?
I've got great news. Mom and Dad just said I could keep him.
I'm sure you two are gonna be the best of friends.
- Now, for $ 200...
- Where's the kid?
We tailed him all the way up the park.
- We never had a chance.
- You should see this place, man.
There's gotta be, maybe
200 people livin' there.
You guys, we can't let the kid take the heat for us.
Yeah, man. If we don't get him, they're gonna torture that kid.
- What in heaven's name are we waiting for?
- But what about Fagin?
Alas, our beleaguered benefactor, bearing the brunt of our futile endeavours.
Gimme a break. Speak
English, Frankie.
- Francis. Francis. Francis!
- All right, cool it!
Now, we got work to do.
First, we'll spring the kid.
Then, we'll take care of the old man. All right?
Yeah, that's right, man!
He's family. He's blood.
- Hear! Hear!
- Okay, troops. Our mission begins at daybreak.
Einstein, go up to the door.
Francis, you're our...
Oh, Jennifer. I don't hear any practising.
All right, Winston.
I gotta practise now, kitty.
Oh-ho, you wanna practise too.
You and me together
Will be forever
You'll see
We two can be
good company
You and me
Yes, together we two
Together, that's you
Forever with me
We'll always be
good company
You and me
Yes, together we'll be
You and me together
Will be forever
You'll see
We'll always
Be good company
You and me
Just wait
And see
Good night, Oliver.
Bye, Winston.
Goodbye, Oliver.
Hi, Jenny.
Sit over here.
All right, listen up. We checked it out. All we gotta do is...
Oh, man! He's dead meat now.
I'll handle that ruffian.
- Hurricane Gilbert takes a blow!
- Body slam! Body slam!
Oh, come on, you fool!
Hit him! Hit him!
Oh, bother.
Einy.
- Get outta there!
- Huh?
Yes? Who is it?
Oh, my.
You! Put the...
I'll show you, you...
Come back here!
What...
Mira lo this place.
Check it out.
Chagall. Matisse.
These are all masterpieces.
Huh. This place looks pretty nice.
I mean, how bad off could it be here?
Hey, man, if this is torture, chain me to the wall.
Tito!
We're here for the kid, remember?
Now, let's get him and go.
"I love you, Oliver.
Play with Georgette."
I'd like to play with him, all right! The little fur ball!
Ooh.
Who are you?
What do you want?
- Winston!
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Calm down.
Don't come any closer! I knew this would happen one day.
You're barkin' up the wrong tree. It's not you I'm after.
It's not? It's not?
Well, why not?
What's the problem, Spot?
Not good enough for you?
I mean, do you even know who I am?
Fifty-six blue ribbons.
Fourteen regional trophies.
Six-time national champion!
Ooh, and we're all very impressed, right, guys?
Very impressed.
Oh!
Allow me to introduce myself. I am
Ignacio Alonzo Julio Federico de Tito.
Get away from me, you little bug-eyed creep!
Winston!
- Excuse me, uh, sister. Who's Rex?
- None of your business!
And you, tubby, off the bed!
Get away from there, you...
All right, that does it!
You yo-yo's clear out and I mean now!
Winston!
Relax, champ. We'll leave as soon as we get our cat.
If you think I'm intimidated by a bunch of flea-bitten, dog-pound rejects...
Your cat?
How stupid of me. You must be the friends he keeps talking about.
- Yes.
- Georgette?
Something's not quite right here.
Quick. Before he comes back. Follow me.
Look at him, Dodger.
Honey, let's just forget the whole thing.
No, no, you can't do that!
You don't understand.
- The poor dear's so traumatized.
- Georgette.
- Huh? What?
- What is going on here?
Now get goin'. Hurry.
Use the fire escape.
Hey, there's no time for long goodbyes, but here's something to remember me by, baby.
Ooh, I think she likes me, man.
Ooo, I could've danced all night
I could've danced all night
- You were very good. Nice job, Dodger.
- W-What? What? Hey, wait.
- What's goin' on, you guys?
- It was just the rescue of the century.
- Res-Rescue?
- Should've seen Frankie handle that butler, man.
I was rather good, wasn't I?
And how about Tito and
Miss Six-Time National Champion?
Hey, hey, but wait. l-l-I don't understand you guys.
- Hey. You okay, kid?
- Yeah, I'm fine, bu...
Hey, sure he is! He's back with his Uncle Tito. l-l-I was happy there.
Why did you guys take me away?
We rescued you, kitty.
I mean, we brought you home.
But... Well, I, I have another home now.
And someone who loves me.
What do you mean, kid?
You're in the gang.
- But, but...
- The gang means family.
We risked a lot to get you outta there.
Look, I'm sorry, but all
I ever wanted was, was like...
Wha-What? This place is not good enough for you any more? Don't wanna mix with the riffraff?
No, no. I like you.
I mean, I li... I li... I like every-every one of you, but...
But there was a little girl.
I just wanna go back.
We never shoulda took him, Dodger.
- Dodger, please...
- You wanna leave? Fine.
There's the door.
- But he just got here.
- Go on. No one's stoppin' ya.
Hey, uh, Dodger, man, uh, lighten up.
You lighten up! If he doesn't like it, let him go.
Oh, it's hopeless.
Oh.
What's this?
So that's where you've been!
Looks like you're doing all right for yourself, Oliver.
Your owner probably spends more money on catnip... than we do on food in a month.
He's probably worried sick about you.
All alone in that big house with only his money to comfort him.
Only his millions and millions of dollars to...
That's it!
We're saved!
What a plan!
Ah, yes!
Paper! Paper!
Whoo, it's so great.
Dear Mister Rich...
Mister Very Rich...
- Bye, Jenny!
- Oliver!
Oliver?
Oliver!
- Feel it. Make your body work.
That's it. Very good.
- Oliver!
- Oliver!
- Two, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Oh, you love it!
Oliver, I'm home.
That's funny.
Georgette, help me find Oliver.
Oliver! Oliver!
Oh, where could he be?
Oliver?
He's not here.
Where is he? Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.
"Dear Mr Very Rich
Cat-owner Person."
Whoops.
"And if you don't bring the money, you'll never see your cat again."
Oh, no. Georgette, something terrible has happened.
They've kidnapped Oliver.
Oh, Georgette.
You loved him too.
Don't worry.
We're going to get him back.
This is an airtight plan, Sykes.
Sweet and simple.
I ransom the kitty, and you get paid in full tomorrow.
I'll even toss in a little extra for your patience.
What do you say? It's my final offer. Take it or leave it.
- Yeah, who is it?
- Oh.
Fagin, it's you.
Why didn't you say so?
Oh, good question!
But listen. If you're busy, we can drop by some other time.
Don't be silly.
Just push the door.
I said, push!
What do you mean?
You start with the knuckles.
Ah, Fagin. Do come in.
I'll be right with you.
Yeah. No, you don't kill him yet.
Yeah.
And then? What's-What's the last thing you do? You put on the cement shoes.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's right.
Come on. Hey, don't worry about it.
So, Fagin.
- Did we bring something green and wrinkly to make me happy?
- Sykes,
I've got an airtight k-kitty... plan, plan!
It's sweet and simple, the plan.
- Let's just take this from the top.
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
What... What am I gonna do with you, Fagin?
- I've got this kitty, you see.
- Fagin.
You don't got the money.
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no, no, no! Stop!
Please, Sykes, please! Sykes,
I'm getting your money tonight! It's coming tonight!
Please, it's from a rich cat. No, I mean a cat from a rich family. Please, don't!
They're coming tonight with the money
I owe you, uh, to get the cat back.
Hey, I think there's hope for you yet.
I'm proud of you, Fagin.
Yeah, you're startin' to think big.
You've got 12 hours.
And, Fagin, this is your last chance.
Turn left right when you get to the big propeller.
Oh, Georgette, I can't read this!
It says... No, that...
No, that's not right. It's left.
Oh, Georgette, where are we?
I think we're lost.
Stay close, Georgette.
It's creepy down here.
He's late. I drew a perfectly good map.
Well, there was a few smudges on it, okay.
I went outside the line with the green crayon, but not that much.
- Oh, Dodge.
- A child could read that map.
- Hey, Rita.
- They never laid a paw on me.
- Ooh, wait!
- What if he comes, and he's huge and mean?
- Excuse me, sir.
It's the FBI! I didn't do it!
I didn't do it! I was framed.
Listen, little girl, this is a tough neighbourhood. You'd better go home.
I can't. I'm lost.
Aw, gee. Lost. Well, I'd help you, but I'm kind of busy right now.
- What are you doing down here, anyway?
- I came to find my kitty.
- Your kitty?
- Somebody stole him.
- But-But, uh, are you sure? Maybe you made a m... a m... a mistake. Maybe...
- No.
- No, somebody stole him and sent me this note. See? I'm lost.
- Easy, boys.
Look, I even brought this to get him back.
- You brought a piggy bank.
- It's all I have.
- That's awful.
- I know.
And what kind of a person would steal a poor little kitty?
But l... I mean, maybe he...
Maybe he was up against a wall, at the end of his rope.
- He must have been a poor, desperate man.
- It's still wrong.
And I'm so scared. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do.
Neither do I.
Hey, guess what?
I found a little lost kitten. l-I don't know.
Take a look. Maybe he's yours.
Oliver! Oliver! Oh, my Oliver!
Sykes. Sykes!
I was gonna...
- Hey! Hey, wait! What are you doing?
- Let go.
No! No, wait! You can't do this!
Keep your mouth shut. We'll consider our account closed.
Stop! Stop! Time out!
- Time out! Oh, please!
- Wha... What happened?
- Sykes!
- You okay, kid?
- Jenny? He took Jenny!
Don't worry.
We'll get her back.
- You... You will?
- Hey, "absitively," kid.
Come on, man, let's go! Come on!
- Man, let's get him, man!
- All right. Let's do it.
Wait, wait! Come back!
Stay. Sit. Wa-Wait.
Come back.
Oh, man. It don't look good.
It's all locked up, Dodger.
All right.
There's gotta be some way in.
Yeah, Francis.
Now, don't cry, little girl.
They only eat when I tell them to.
- Francis, you all set?
- Farewell, Dulcinea.
- Francis!
- Frankie!
- Francis.
- Peasants.
Maestro?
- Ready, kid?
- Yeah.
Go!
Roscoe. DeSoto.
Come on, DeSoto.
Hey, hey, hey!
There is a lady present.
Well, it's nice to see that one of you has some manners.
- After you, my little croissant.
- Good grief.
And remember, quiet.
Oh!
- I broke a nail.
- Oh, balderdash.
- What you call my woman, man?
- Freeze!
- Yo, Tito.
- Right. I'll check it out.
Yeah. Oh, that's funny, Mr Winston.
But I don't think you really appreciate the situation.
Somebody could get hurt.
Now, you just get the old man on the phone and tell him it's about his daughter,
Jenny.
Okay, listen up.
Tito, Francis, I want you...
You smell that?
Yeah. It's party time.
What the...
Didn't order any pizza.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Where are those dogs?
Oh, Oliver!
I thought I'd never see you again.
Ahem. Gentlemen.
What's the occasion?
Come to rescue your little friend?
- Say goodbye, Francis.
- Oh, boys!
- Whoopsy-daisy!
- All right! What a woman!
Francis, you keep an eye on the monitors. Rita, over here.
What is this, a slumber party?
Get going, you stupid mutts!
Francis, is the coast clear? Francis!
- Goodness! Oh, whatever do we do?
- What are we gonna do, Dodge?
- Yo, Tito. Hot-wire.
- Hey, no way, Dodger, man.
- I've been barbecued too many times, man.
- Good luck, Alonzo.
- Huh?
- I'll be waiting.
Hey!
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's off to work we go
What is this?
All right, girlie, open the door.
Come on, now.
Girlie, I'm warnin' ya.
- Come on, Tito.
- You just...
- Back up, DeSoto.
- DeSoto?
- Come on!
Come on!
This has all been very entertaining.
But the party is over.
Oh, come on!
Come on, come on! Let's go!
Fagin!
Hey, man, you're ugly! And you're uglier than him! And you're Ugly, Part Three!
Hey, you're Revenge of the Ugly!
Okay, friends, come on.
Mr Fagin! Mr Fagin, help me!
All right! Check it out.
Help me! Oh.
- Save me! Save me, Alonzo!
- Hey, get off my back, woman.
I'm driving.
- Let go!
- Jenny, jump!
Alonzo!
Oliver?
Oliver? Oliver!
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dearJenny
Happy birthday to you
- And many more
- Don't forget to make a wish, Jennifer.
All right, anybody want some cake?
Okay, Einstein, but not the whole thing.
Yeah, you got it now, baby.
Yeah, left foot, right foot.
All right. Check it out.
There you go. Relax. Hey!
- Tito, you dance divinely.
- He's cheating!
- Hit him! Hit him!
- Body slam! Come on, hit him again.
Murder him. Twist his arm!
- Foxworth residence. Mr Foxworth!
- Body slam him now!
Uh, my goodness.
You're back tomorrow?
Oh, she'll be so surprised to see you.
Y-Yes, goodbye, sir.
- All right. Get him! Get him!
All right. Look out!
- Hit him! Come on. Murder him! Get him!
- Pick him up. Hold him there.
- Ta-da!
- I believe that's a ten spot, old sport?
- Now, where...
Where is that chequebook?
Oh, look at the time!
Well, we better be going.
Indeed.
Frances, Rita, Tito, vamanos!
- The streets are calling!
- Now, Jennifer, have we forgotten anything?
Oh, yeah. Thanks, everyone.
The gifts were great.
Bye, Mr Fagin, and thank you.
Oh, bye-bye, Jenny.
Come on, boys, it's time for us to go.
Alonzo, darling, could I see you for a moment? Privately?
Privately. Ooh!
Coming, Alonzo?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You guys beat it. Uh, uh, my baby and I, uh, we gotta talk.
You know, you're not so bad for a bug-eyed little creep.
- With a little grooming...
- Grooming? Uh...
That's it. We'll start with a bath.
Bath?
- Let's go!
- Bye-bye.
- Oh, Oliver, we shall meet again.
- Hey, see you around, kid.
Goodbye, you guys.
Boys, let's go!
Listen, kid, you just wanna hang out or anything...
Hey, Dodger, man. Hey, do you see her anywhere?
- Hey, whoa!
- Man, I can't keep this woman off me.
- Oh, man, I gotta get away from that chick...
- Alonzo?
Alonzo
Oh, uh, goodbye, Oliver.
Hey, you guys, wait for me, man!
Alonzo Federico Tito, you come back here this minute!
Hey, whoa, kid.
You think you can handle the champ?
Sure.
Hey, you're okay. For a cat.
We'll keep a spot open for you in the gang. Vice president, uptown chapter.
Later, kid.
- Why should I worry, tell me
- Bye-bye!
- Bye!
- Why should I care
- What a delightful scoundrel.
Say, I may not have a dime
Oh, but I got
street savoir faire
Why should we worry
Why should we care
We may not have a dime, but
we've got street savoir faire
Why should we worry
Why should we care
It's just a be-bopulation
We got street savoir faire
The rhythm of the city
Boy, once you get it down
Said, you can own this town
You can wear the crown
Why should we worry
Why should we care
It's just a doo-wopulation
We got street savoir faire
Why should we worry
Why should we care
And even when we cross that line
We got street savoir faire
