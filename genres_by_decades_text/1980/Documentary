That stupid punk rock.
I don't, you know...
I just think of it as rock 'n' roll
'cause that's what it is.
You know?
PENELOPE:
What do you like about it?
Well, I like that it's like...
It's something new and it's just reviving like old rock 'n' roll.
And it's like it's raw again.
It's for real.
And it's fun, and you know...
It's like, it's not bullshit.
There's no rock stars now, you know.
Okay, attention!
Attention!
For the third time, attention!
Hey, wait a minute!

-[CROWD APPLAUDING]
Punk music generally, that is, hardcore punk is characterized by its speed.
It has a lot of "fuzz" as musicians call it, cranked into the music, it's high volume, high speed, usually monotone volumes, vocals, uh, characterized by protest type lyrics.
I think a lot of the time that it gets out of hand is because of the speed of the music, which is way above the normal rhythm of a dance.
You know, if you take a four-four disco time signature, you know, just comfortably, you can kind of...
...dance easily to the disco rhythm which is,
I understand,
126 to 132 heartbeats a minute.
[PUNK ROCK PLAYING]
Whereas the kind of music that the Germs or the Black Flag is playing is upwards of 250,
300 beats a minute.
Which is not comfortable or normal to dance to.
One, two, three, four!
One, two, three...
[PUNK ROCK PLAYING]
And this is why this dance that you'll see in the film, the Pogo dance, which is, you know, jumping up and down and bouncing off walls and stuff like that.
This kind of an abnormal level of adrenalin.
And uh...
And so sometimes, some violence breaks out.
Wow! Man!
Nowadays, I don't...
I think the kids are,
I don't know, more desperate or something like that or more bored.
Some of the better of the punk bands that developed into, son of, like, folk music.
I don't mean folk music as a traditional folk music.
But the allegory can be drawn in the 60s when protesters used acoustic guitars.
Now, instead of acoustic guitars, you know, they have high-speed,
300 beats a minute speed rock.
And yelling about the same things.
About how their air was poisoned out there.
You know, the air in utopia is poisoned.
You know, the final joke, so...
It's Black Flag.
It's Black Flag.

[MIC FEEDBACK]
[SCREAMING]
[SINGING]
Okay, the Church, uh...
It used to be a Baptist church and now they just rent out all the rooms in it and stuff.
And there's some other bands in here.
We practice here.
And Ron lives here and Robo lives here.
PENELOPE: What's the most people that ever lived here?
[GIGGLES]
A bunch of hippies rent.
PENELOPE: What about the hippies?
You get along with the hippies?
They're okay
'cause they just get loaded.
And they're pretty mellow.
[LAUGHING]
Mellow dudes!
They're neutralized.
The smoke so much pot that they're neutralized.
And you don't smoke pot?
Even if they get pissed off, they have a joint and they talk about it, instead of doing something about it.
Ron, can you show us where you live, please?
You mean, like, specifically, where I sleep?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Well, this room is where I live.
[SIG HS]
This is a two-room apartment here.
Rig ht here, this is a three-room.
It's not exactly what you would call a penthouse or anything like that but this is my...
[WHOOPING]
This is where all the action goes on, rig ht?
So, yeah, all these, uh...
There's autographs from all these girls and stuff, you know.
Some used panties and shit like that.
[WOMAN LAUGHING]
This is one of my victims, right?
[BAND MEMBERS LAUGHING]
Robo's place is a little less sleazier than mine.
He's up here.
[LAUGHING]
- PENELOPE: Has that got a bed?
- Mmm...
PENELOPE: Okay, let's see.
Is that a bed?
- Yeah, it is a bed.
- PENELOPE: How much does it cost?
Uh, $16 a month.
How much do you make per month, when you, uh... as a performer?
Uh...
- Pretty much nothing.
- BAND MEMBER: Negative.
Negative, yeah, actually.
And I mean
Well, like Greg was saying, we don't make very much off gigs and most of it goes back into, like, the promotion.
And, you know, expenses.
Usually, maybe I could get a meal out of it here and there.
Otherwise, I'll just have to find rich girls and stuff like that.
[LAUGHING]
I can't rent a house because
I owe the gas company money.
I owe the electrical company money.
I owe the telephone company money.
Sol cannot rent a house under my name.
Sol might as well live in a fucking closet for $16 a month, you know.
PENELOPE: Where are you from?
- Well, I'm... Puerto Rico.
-Yeah.
[IN MOCK ACCENT]
But I like to live in America.
[ALL LAUGHING]
PENELOPE: How come the songs are so fast and short?
They're fast because that's what gets us off, okay?
- That's the energy level.
- Yeah.
And they're short because that's how long the inspiration lasts.
If you take the amount of verses that they have and the amount of lyrics and stuff, they're...
You know, they're as long as any other songs.
PENELOPE: What clubs have you been banned from?
Well, the ones we've been banned from are like, uh,
Bla-Bla Café, The Whiskey,
Gazzarri's, Club 88,
Hong Kong Café.
PENELOPE: Why were you banned?
Um, I don't know.
Somehow we got a...
Well, you know, a lot of people that...
You know, when we play, they get pretty violent.
Some of the clubs, they just aren't used to that.
And we got a bad reputation for some reason and then they kind of...
By the press and by the club owners talking to each other, it kind of spreads around.
PENELOPE: What does Black Flag mean, the word Black Flag?
Um, it means anarchy.
Okay. Here's what it is.
When I was in fucking high school, in Junior High, everybody told me how things were.
And you know, how it...
It just didn't work for me, you know?
It's fucking fucked up like crazy.
PENELOPE: Fucked up, how?
Just things, things didn't work right and I was always bummed out.
- PENELOPE: So?
- So when I got in school,
I mean, I didn't know what was going on.
I didn't have any consciousness of what to do or what and when and where, so I just stayed in school.
I just kept on going because
I didn't have any idea of what to do.
I thought, "Well, okay.
I'll study psycho-biology."
I'm worried about brains and all that shit, you know?
I did brain operations. I did...
You know, put hooks, you know...
I cut open their brains and I put...
Stick little wires in their heads and...
Zapped out pans of them and zapped drugs into them and I watched what they did.
4 did a lot of that.
- PENELOPE: You learned from it?
Yeah, I learned a lot from it.
That's where I came up with all my ideas.
PENELOPE: What do you think of his haircut?
Oh, oh, his haircut.
It's okay.
PENELOPE: Why did you cut your hair like that?
Why did I? 'Cause I'm searching.
- PENELOPE: 'Cause you're what?
-'Cause I'm searching.
[ALL LAUGHING]
He knows where it's...
He knows where it's at now.
I'm looking for something.
In other words, it's the search.
He's tried...
So far he's tried, uh...
He's tried punk rock.
He's tried...
- CHUCK: Jesus.
Jesus.
- No, I'm trying them all.
- Harvey Carson.
[LAUGHING]
PENELOPE: What are you searching for?
I really don't know.
No, I'll know when I find it.
[BOTTLES CLINKING]
You know, I did this because I felt like...
To set myself aside and make myself different, maybe, maybe it would just come to me.
PENELOPE: What is it?
[BAND MEMBERS
HUMMING MEDITATIVELY]
No, that's not it.
[ALL LAUGHING]
Shit!
Okay, this next song...
This is for the LAPD.
We got arrested the other night at Blackie's for playing punk rock music.
They called us
"nuisance in public" or something like that.
Anyway, they put us in jail, and this song is called Revenge.
And it's for them.
[SINGING]
It's not my imagination
We got a gun on my back
Promises you made
Never become fact
We're gonna get revenge
You won't know what hit you
We're tired of being screwed
Don't tell me about tomorrow
Don't tell me what HI get
I can't think of progress
When just around the comer
There's a bed of cold pavement
Waiting for me
Revenge! I'll watch them bleed
Revenge! That's all I'll need
I won't cry if you die!
Die!
We're gonna get revenge
You won't know what hit you
We're tired of being screwed
Revenge!
Revenge!
PENELOPE: Why don't the club owners hire the Germs any more?
Mmm, we do get shows occasionally but it is getting harder.
I think there's a lot of bands now.
And when we were first doing it, there weren't that many bands.
And a lot of the new bands are just more co-operative as far as doing a sedate, safe stage show.
There's no threat of, um...
...an imminent riot.
I've had promoters grab me and shake me and say,
"Stop this show. It's on the verge of becoming a riot."
[DRUMS BEATING]
[PEOPLE SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
[GUITAR STRUMS]
DARBY: Find me a fucking beer!
PENELOPE: How did you get the reputation that you have?
I guess we used to do stuff.
I mean, it was good to have that kind of reputation and you know...
But not any more
'cause now we can't play anywhere.
[PUNK ROCK PLAYING]
PENELOPE: Tell me how is it that you're always getting hurt?
Well, first,
I did it on purpose.
- PENELOPE: Yeah?
- To keep from being bored.
He's come out of shows with huge scrapes and scratches and claw marks all over him and just pouring blood, but it always looks a lot worse than it is.
PENELOPE: What's the worst time that you ever got hurt?
Hmm, The Whiskey.
I cut my foot open.
PENELOPE: What happened?
I came down the stairs to do an encore and then I jumped on half a broken glass like that.
And, like, I had to get
30 stitches.
So I was standing like right in front and...
I was looking at his face and, like, you ended up sitting down on the ground.
And you were holding your foot like this and you looked at it and you just started going...
"Ah!" you know and then you stopped playing and stuff.
And you were running around trying to find your tennis shoes.
[CHUCKLES]
And I had to go to the hospital with blue hair and stuff and they were bringing all the nurses in and stuff to look at me.
[PUNK ROCK PLAYING]
PENELOPE: Why do you get so loaded to perform?
Because that way I don't feel myself getting hurt.
And it's scary out there.
You know, it's real scary, like,
'cause when we play we're right down there in the audience and there's lots of creeps out there.
And there's lots of people that have grudges against you now, too.
And so, if I don't get loaded,
I wouldn't be able to do it.
- Do you want some more coffee?
- I just broke this egg.
Well, we've tried everything,
-to get him to do that.
- To do what?
To sing into the mic.
It's just, like, almost like the enemy or something, stay away from it at all costs, it seems.
PENELOPE: So tell me why you never sing into the mics, Darby?
I just don't pay attention to it, once I'm loaded.
We've tried everything short of gluing his mouth to it.
Yeah, this mic's not working.
Things get broken, monitors, mics, but you kind of have to expect that if you're hiring an energetic young band.
Darby, pick up the mic!
The mic!
One...
[GUITAR FEEDBACK]
[PLAYING RIFF]
[DARBY SINGING]
Well, when they first got together as a band, they didn't know how to play their instruments.
And they did things to, kind of, camouflage that.
Darby would smear peanut butter all over him.
He'd dive through broken glass.
He'd break glasses on his head.
And eventually, they learned how to play.
[PLAYING PUNK SONG]
[SCREAMING]
Oh, you are manly!
[SCREAMING]
PENELOPE: What kind of drugs do you take when you're on stage?
LORNA: What doesn't he?
Anything-
Usually, I do speed or something.
And then that gets too nervous so I do some kind of downers.
Then I start drinking.
4 see.
- LORNA: Give me a beer.
Somebody give me a beer.
Damn it, somebody give me a beer.
A beer, damn it! A beer!
Damn it, one of you give me a beer.
Give me a beer, you fucking...
Well, it's more like... being the mother of four three-year-olds who... are always fighting with each other, but not really seriously fighting.
Just, “He did this to me.
She did this.“
I can't stand it and sometimes I get to the end of my rope and just wanna batter my children.
PENELOPE: What happened to your throat?
We were at some party and we were taking pictures and, um, Shannon had like this switch blade like this and I went like that.
Like this side, just missed my jugular and the Swiss knife just missed my wind pipe.
Do you feel like you wanna quit sometimes?
Oh, yes. Almost all the time.
PENELOPE: Tell me about the painter.
MICHELLE: Oh, the dead painter.
My parents were in China.
And we were just finishing having the house painted.
Coffee.
And Darby and Donny and Dinky and Mark Plummer and my brother were all at my house.
And my brother and I went to take the trash out at, like, one in the morning or something.
And we hadn't been out in the backyard...
It was on a Tuesday, we hadn't been out in the backyard since, um, my parents left, since like the Friday before.
And so, anyways, um,
I went outside and I must have walked right over the guy
'cause I couldn't see anything anyways. [LAUGHS]
And then my brother, my brother goes,
"Isn't there somebody sleeping in the backyard?"
And I just went, "What?
What are you talking about?"
And, um, I went over and looked at him and I was just joking,
I went, "This guy's dead."
And I gave him a kick in the stomach, you know?
And he was dead.
He was dead.
My brother thought we killed him.
He goes, "What should we do?"
Like, "Should we hide the body or something?"
So anyways, um, we went.
And Donny had a camera and we went and we lied down.
I lied down next to him and we all got around him and we took a bunch of pictures, like family pictures and we're all going, "Hi", you know and taking pictures and stuff.
What really happened to the guy?
Um, they think he had a heart attack and fell off the ladder and no one found him for a few days.
[CLEARING THROAT]
It was really funny, actually.
And the paramedics came and they were joking with us.
And the coroner came.
Oh, you remember all those jokes?
Oh, yeah! What was the jokes?
Instead of John Doe, they put down Jose Doe because it was a wet back.
PENELOPE: Didn't you feel bad that the guy was dead?
No, not at all.
Because I hate painters.
[PLAYING SHUTDOWN]
This is Malissa's Song.
Let me

Inculcated desire
And brush the fettered
Veil away
Shut down
[MUTTERING]
In the depths I lay
Shut down
In the depths I lay
Shut me
Touch the tips of inculcated
Desire
And brush the fettered
Veil away
Shut down
In the depths I lay

Gonna miss joy

One more time
This is Melissa's song!
Shut down
Shut down, go away

Hey!
Hey!
Go away from here.
Get away from here!

DARBY: Hey, can we do more?
[SCREAMING]
-[WHISTLING]
-DARBY: No more?
ROBERT EGGS'. Slash Magazine began in May of 1977.
It was an idea of Steve Samiof and Melanie Nissen.
And it was basically, at that point, a fanzine
about the local, uh...
Los Angeles bands, garage bands.
And would be better than garage bands.
And the first print run was a thousand as pretty thin paper.
And then it just kept growing until now we're at 20,000, uh, circulation.
[TYPEWRITER CLACKING]
It's a major accomplishment that we come out every month
because there a lot of problems
tugging at the whole thing every month.
I mean, it seems like each month we seem to, uh, alienate
at least one record company by a review
or a band or someone, you know, that's pissed off at us.
And everyone seems to get on everyone else's nerves.
And there are things that happen like one of the contributors got on another one's nerves, so he broke the other guy's collar bone.
And then, uh, another contributor punched out one of our photographers who refuses to contribute any photographs until he gets a written apology.
I have excellent news for the world.
There's no such thing as "new wave."
It does not exist.
It's a figment of, uh... a lame cunt's imagination.
There was never any such thing as "new wave."
It's just a polite thing to say when you are trying to explain you were not into the boring old rock 'n' roll, but you didn't dare to say punk because you were afraid to get kicked out of the fucking party and they wouldn't give you coke any more.
There's new music, there's new underground sound.
There's noise, there's punk, there's power pop, there's ska, there's rockabilly.
But "new wave" doesn't mean shit.
"Hey, I'm writing to you because
"I'm told you're an expert in the field of punk rockers.
"The question I have arises out of an experience I had
"on a recent Saturday on Pico Boulevard.
"As I approached a close-by phone booth, a nasty-looking lad
“who was standing in the middle of the crosswalk.
"He stood there for a few seconds
“while a couple of weirdos ran around
“to the backside of my car
“and attached themselves to my bumper.
“They continued to hang on while! drove away
"and seemed to be enjoying themselves.
"Is it the music they listen to
"that causes them to act this way?
"Sincerely, Confused."
KICKBOY FACE:
We get letters, right?
But we get letters from the hardcore,
from the fanatics, you know?
And the letters we get, it's either, "We love you.
“You're great. You're fantastic.
You saved my life!“
Or you know, "Suck my dick!"
You know, "You pieces of shit!"
"Go back to France, go back to England.
"Go back to Missouri."
I mean, whatever.
And you know, "Shut up!"
"You're horrible."
"You're a bunch of faggots."
"You're a bunch of communists."
"You're a bunch of fascists."
"You're a bunch of sexists."
"We don't like you."
Personally, I've been through one too many youth movements.
[LAUGHING]
- PENELOPE: What are you doing?
- Proofreading.
Are there mistakes in the paper?
Yeah, our typist makes too many mistakes.
Why?
She's a little stoned most of the time.
You'll find little cigarette burns and stuff like that.
[PHONE RINGING]
Yes, Slash Magazine?
There was a riot at the Hong Kong last night?
God, what happened?
Hold on a second.
The firemen got a report saying there were too many people inside?
Uh-huh. And then what did they do?
You mean people thought that the firemen were part of a band?
Why? Because they came out on the stage?
Oh, there were five of them?
[LAUGHS HEARTILY]
Yes. And uh...
And when did everybody find out they were not pan of a band but they were the real thing?
Oh, nobody ever found out?
[LAUGHING]
PENELOPE: Does Kickboy have a lot of enemies?
Uh, I should hope so otherwise
I'm wasting my fucking time.
I mean, I'm not writing, you know, to be pleasant and just have everybody say,
"What a pal!
What a great guy!" You know?
I mean, I'm not using all these fucking hatred and contempt, you know, as a style 'cause
I don't have a style, you know?
I mean, you pick up one article, you pick another article next month and there's no style.
Except it's always overkill so if that's a style, you know...
- The intent is...
- But the intent is to really piss off people that you know,
I really hate and I want to see them dead.
And I really despise everything they stand for, every word they say, the way they live.
And I really want them to hate me.
It makes me feel good.
[CHUCKLES]
CLAUDE:
This is a trendy one here!
[UNDERGROUND BABYLON PLAYING]
Sitting in a room
Surrounded by bottles
My friends have all left
But my head is on fire
it's already morning
But pieces of the night
Are still stuck to my hair
What we did is fading
In the light of the day
What we say is bullshit
We live the modem way
And I guess HI never find out
Which one of you wrote
With a greasy lipstick
Babylon must fall
Babylon must fall
Babylon must fall
on the bathroom mirror
on a spotty mattress
I will lay for hours
Adding up all my sins
And inventing new ones
I'm proud of my life
And I stand by my doom
I can't tel! right from wrong
And ifs never stopped me
AH the prophets have died
The books have been written
Salvation in a jar
We'll laugh so hard it hurts
And I guess HI never find out
Which one of you wrote
With a greasy lipstick
Babylon must fall
Babylon must fall
Babylon must fall
on the bathroom mirror
I like the taste of guilt
8 know the taste of death
It makes me want to sing
it makes me want to bite
When all the dumbfucks sleep
With their bland little brains
Full of bland little dreams
We try our new curses
Experiment with fear
Experiment with fear
Sit in each others soul
And rehearse our downfall
“Catholic Discipline.“
It's, uh, a graffiti that a couple of years ago when I was... working at the Masque uh, pan time,
I was cleaning up this shit on Monday mornings.
Uh, it's the graffiti that
I found on the mens' room wall in big dripping red letters.
[PEOPLE CLAPPING]
PENELOPE: How do you feel when you're performing?
I feel powerful.
I feel like I'm making an ass out of myself but I'm getting away with it.
That's what I feel like.
There used to be a punk club in Warsaw, Poland.
And they used to send us letters all the time, um, real stilted English and everything.
And then we'd get letters from Madrid, and Tokyo, Sweden, all over the place... about Punk!
[LAUGHING]
PENELOPE: Why do they like it so much?
It's... It's... They gotta do something with their time and it's the most fun so...
Nothing else is going on.
It's the only form of revolution left, I think.
In the 1980s, you know?
KICKBOY: "I felt compelled to speak out against
“all the sniveling, blithering idiots to you.
"Sniveling, bleeding heart liberals,
"who want to shut down nuclear plants in California."
Right.
"I lay odds that the same entire technology of freaks and hippies
"whining about reducing this and waste that
"will be the first on their knees begging
"for nuclear power at the first sign of a blackout
"when their fucking stereos won't come on.
"I say lets get these plants on their feet
“and cranking out some real power.“ Yeah.
“As far as waste goes,
“there are thousands and thousands of miles of ocean
“just sitting there doing nothing.
“So what are we waiting for?
“Throw the plutonium or strutonium 90
“or whatever the hell it is in there,
“along with all the blubbering idiots who can't accept the fact
“that the future is here and they goddamn well
“ought to try and be a pan of it.
"And as far as the animals on the extinct list go,
"they obviously don't have what it takes to make it."
Yeah.
"Survival of the fittest and we are winning. [LAUGHING]
"I say kill them all off.
"And let's start worrying about some real problems instead.
“Now don't get me wrong.
"I love nature as much as the next guy
“but enough is enough.
" And I, for one, have had enough.“
Anyway this is, uh...
This is the way young people feel.
This is a fucking off song so you better be fucking respectful because it's not about much love, it's about a handful of love.
But a handful of love is better than no love at all.
I mean, there's no more brotherhood shit, you know?
PENELOPE: [LAUGHING]
Why not?
It's not like, uh, you know, we're not all grooving on the same vibes any more.
Everybody's grooving on different vibes.
Ugly vibes.
[SINGING] You're so pink
You're so smooth
My Barbie Doll mistress
You're so clean
You're so small
You live in my pocket
We take the bus together
But I just pay for one
We sit by a window
Away from the black kids
I wait a little bit
Then I stick a finger inside
Of my pocket
I rub for your blond hair
And you try to bite me
Tiny bits of plastic
Tiny bits of plastic
Tiny bits of fantastic
Uncontrolled, pressed for more
Barbie doll lust
R's not normal
Barbie doll lust
R's not normal
Barbie doll lust
R's not normal
When no one is looking
I gently pull you out
Holding you by the neck
Your legs between my knees
Your minute eyelashes
Flicker incessantly
While funny pip-squeak sounds
Come from your rosy lips
I pull on your prom dress
Until it rips apart
While someone on the bus
Pukes on an old lady
Pukes on an old lady
"Dissolve and die, lie through your teeth,
"accepting the fact that these masses,
"these perpetual bourgeois never leave
"their happy homes in the suburbs
"and refuse to learn new ideas, they still disgust me.
"Do I belong?
You see them laugh.
"They laugh at themselves and call it comedy.
"They laugh at each other and call it satire.
“They laugh at cripples and call it cruelty.
" Mass middle class laughter permeating every conversation.
"They keep themselves in stitches
“and think they're happy.
“Do not fear the new.
“Must not let this bourgeois
“control the factors of your life.
“Bum the books of poetry for they encourage hope.
“Do not give them purpose for existence.
“Now listen to the fervent cry
“of the bourgeois self-destruction.
"Watch them. Watch them drain their hope and mission.
"Death and destruction.
"I have respect for the middle class.
"I have respect for the mundane.
"I respect the middle class.
I know l am one of them
"and they never let you scream."

There's laughing outside
We're locked out of the public eyes
Some smooth chords
on the car radio
No hard chords

We set the trash on fire
And watch outside the door
Men come up the pavement
Under the marquee
There's laughing inside
We're locked out of the public eyes

[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
Oh, okay-
Yeah. Chain from each one, chain from this.
And a chain from the heart to an eight ball.
PENELOPE: Did you think a long time about what kind of tattoo you were gonna get?
If you don't, you're a fool.
Yeah, yeah. I just didn't want to write, you know, like, fuck between my knuckles or some bullshit like that. I mean, I'll be wanting to get...
MAN: That's what
I was going to get.
[LAUGHING]
No, well...
Yeah!
I mean, if I'm going to get a tattoo,
I want it to be cool, you know?
You give a lot of thought about what you're gonna have
'cause you wanna have something stupid but after you get that thing done, then it stands.
PENELOPE: You can look back and say,
"Well, at least l had fun in those times, huh?"
Well, but its not fun.
At least, I had that time.
I can remember that time.
And hopefully, we're together enough to rem ember when we got it.
[LAUGHING]
I'm going to wake up with another funny haircut and more tattoos.
- Are you going to get a tattoo?
- No.
- Why?
- I don't want a tattoo.
How come?
Um...
I don't know.
I just don't want one.
Don't wanna be too trendy.
Two dozen pink roses from The Whiskey.
PENELOPE: For what?
Um...
- MAN: For being so...
- For being cute.
'Cause we do a good job whenever we play there
'cause when we play there, they do better business than anybody else.
They're real happy with us.
They come backstage and talk to us and everything.
They like us, you know?
Anyway, it was real cool when we came in there, it was just this mass of roses.
PENELOPE: Do they do that for everyone?
No! Of course not.
PENELOPE: Where do they come from?
The Whiskey, but I don't know where they got them.
- No, but...
-[HISSES]
PENELOPE: Where did the song
Beyond and Back come from?
Beyond and Back is about sleeping on the couch.
And the word "Beyond"...
The title, Beyond and Back comes from a Bible pamphlet.
There was one called,
Beyond and Back which is what I felt like, to, like, reach this hideous state but then return to normal, you know, normal situations.
PENELOPE: And that's what you...
Sleeping on the bed in the master, the master bedroom.
PENELOPE: Do you get a lot of trouble about how you look when you walk down the street?
Sometimes. Not so much.
What do you do about it?
- Kill them.
- MAN: Pulls out his knife.
Pass on by unless
I'm in a bad mood.
PENELOPE: And if you're in a bad mood, what do you do?
Then I turn around and look at somebody with the expression that Jimmy taught me, which is,
"You're gonna die or you're gonna walk away."
[LAUGHING]
And usually they walk away.
I haven't had to...
PENELOPE: Kill anyone yet...
Do you think your songs look on the dark side of things?
They look on the realistic side of things.
Realism is dark and they're on the dark side of things.
PENELOPE: How long have you been playing?
- Guitar?
- Yeah.
- Ever since I was six.
- Right.
Before that I just played piano and violin and accordion.
PENELOPE: Why do you stand like that on stage?
Like what?
With your legs apart.
I wondered, do you know?
I think because he's so sexy,
I don't know.
- BILLY: I don't.
- I think it's real sexy.
I guess that he's just one of the last...
Maybe his style.
The last people left that are just like have lots of style and lots of like sex appeal and can just... And don't give a shit, you know, about being that way and that's not like...
-[INDISTINCT]
-...punk or anything.
-It's just like this...
4 know, I know.
Everybody's got their style.
That just be Billy's style.
He just stands there and he's cool.
And he doesn't need to do anything else
'cause he's already cool enough.
Is my make up okay?
PENELOPE: Why do you collect those little pamphlets?
Because they're cool.
And because they say...
They're really ridiculous.
They say the most insane things.
And you cannot believe that society's gotten to the state where there are these things you find in the gutter that say,
"The activities of homosexuals and lesbians,
"a detailed expose of the activities
"of these depraved humans would be so revolting that
"it might 'cause a sane person to vomit.
"If you wish the sordid details, consult sexual pathology,
"pathology or sexual pathology
"or the dictionary book for some information.
"Shalom, Israel, the everlasting nation."
But they said that...
- Where does that come from?
- This is so gross.
If you want to find out more, here you can find it.
[HICCUPING] I found that on Hollywood Boulevard...
- Do you have the hiccups?
- Mmm.
And this one's real good,
"What to do to go to hell?"
And you open it up and it's empty.
[LAUGHING]
Did you know that here in this city of LA...
Uh, uh, uh. No.
Wait, there's one thing about public schools.
I think it's on the back of this.
Oh, yeah.
"The product of a public school wanders aimlessly asking,
"'Where did I come from? Why am
I here and where am I going?
"Public education makes leeches and sends people to hell."
[HICCUPS]
[CHUCKLES]
I don't understand this.
Isn't it so weird that people could say that?
"Public education makes leeches."
[HICCUPING]
Anyway, suppose it is true after all. What then?
Yeah. You don't wanna die and you're just this cripple, you're just this idiot and you can't believe that everything's gonna...
BAND MEMBER: Hey, what the fuck is going on in there?
Shut up, you bastard!
[HICCUPING]
PENELOPE: Where did you guys meet?
We met in Venice.
Venice, California.
- EXENE: In a lovely paradise...
- How long ago?
- That's not even possible.
- EXENE: No!
- Three years ago.
- PENELOPE: Yeah.
And you just started doing...
No, there was six months of very bad, bad times.
- Yeah. What was that?
- Between she and me.
Just not getting along and not really...
- PENELOPE: And then you did?
- Yeah.
[SINGING TOGETHER]
Yeah.
We played in our little apartment in Venice where all the winos lived and went to sleep at 8 o'clock.
- Tell 'em about the wine bottle.
- We couldn't wake him up.
Yes, I lived in an apartment in Venice, California where a throat cancer patient had died.
In his refrigerator, he left all his throat cancer medicine, six bottles of beer, and a half empty bottle of red port.
We drank all the beer.
And decided that we were gonna drink the rest of that red port.
And we knew that we were like fucked up.
I mean, we're drinking throat cancer red port, man.
[WHOOPING]
Come on.
-[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
-[IMITATES ENGINE REVVING]
Yeah!
Pick an ear.
- Now, I see one ear.
- Okay.
- One up, one down. Together?
- One down, three up.
- Right ear moving. Left ear.
- Right on.
How did you learn how to do that?
I don't remember.
[CHUCKLES]
PENELOPE: And do you get letters from people in various places other than in Los Angeles?
EXENE: Yes.
JOHN: Yeah, we had a fan club ad in Slash once.
And we got letters from
North Carolina, Pennsylvania,
- Ontario.
-They called from County Jail.
Right, Chuck called us from the County Jail.
I called there once from jail and you weren't home, you asshole.
[ALL LAUGHING]
Why are you on the floor, Exene?
Mmm.
Well, you know why.
'Cause that guy there, the filmer moved our chair and I'm gonna be sitting here.
- No, no I didn't.
- Look the cock knocker moved it.
[INDISTINCT TALKING]
PENELOPE: W m does the FUN stand for'?
MAN: Fuck the World.

- One small story about--
- How Jimmy couldn't get a life.
Come on, Johnny.
About when Darby Crash came over and tried to stuff all these little cars in his mouth, I hear Exene scream,
"Don't eat the car.
You'll kill yourself!"
PENELOPE: Are you a happier person now, do you think?
PENELOPE: Are you a happier person now, do you think?
No? Yes?
I don't think of myself as a happy person but I had fun tonight.
[HICCUPING]

[CLAPPING]
JOHN: Exene wrote the line,
“Johnny hit and run Pauline“.
I wrote the song around it.
PENELOPE: Mmm-hmm.
JOHN: Uh, basically a fantasy, wish.
The whole idea of the line, that she was still awake,
is that,
you know, yeah...
there's this rape but it's son of a seduction.
It's every man's, like, dream to be able to be
so potent that they can have sex like that.
- EXENE: John.
- If you could have sex once... lf l can have sex once an hour for 24 hours, I would do it.
[PLAYING JOHNNY HIT
AND RUN PAULENE]
He bought a sterilized hypo
To shoot a sex machine drug
He got twenty four hours
To shoot old Pauline
Between the legs
Ninety six tears
Through twenty four hours
Sex once every hour
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
LA bus doors open
Kicking both doors open
When it rested on 6th Street
That's when he drug a girl inside
He was spreading her legs
And didn't understand dying
She was still awake
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
When he was waking up
Beside the bed
He found clumps of hair
The last, Paulene wouldn't cooperate
She wasn't what you call living really
She was still awake
Johnny hit and run Pauline
Johnny hit and run Pauline
Johnny hit and run Pauline
Johnny hit and run Pauline
Oh!
[AUDIENCE CHEERING]
Could you turn the monitors down some, Scott.
[WHISTLING AND APPLAUDING]
BOY-
I guess your mama didn't know what hot was until she got up under some lights.
Man.
Ye-ouch!
We're desperate, um...
John wrote that song.
PENELOPE: Yeah!
When he lived in Venice, he wrote it for me to sing.
And it's really weird because at one point! started thinking,
there's gonna come a point
when we keep performing this song.
People are gonna be going,
“Sure they're desperate.“
I just paid six dollars to see this band,
you know, they 're not desperate.
There's worse ways of being desperate than being poor.
PENELOPE: But you don't have money right new?
- And so...
- Well, we're not rich
- We got enough to pay our rent.
- JOHN: We got six dollars.
You know, we bought the ink and the pins.

JOHN: Hey, woah, hey...
Altamont, all rig ht!
Summer of '68, all right.
Give them a flea bath, quick.
There's a fine line between
There's a fine line between pogo dancing and fighting.
And the fact that if you see somebody you know...
Come up, come here Dutch.
If you see some, somebody over here grabbing a girl and shakin' and shit and throwin' them up against the stage, you know, grabbing her ass or whatever, they are dancing, they're having a good time.
You know, she may be crying, but she may be loving it as weird as these kids can get.
PENELOPE: You think there's gonna be trouble now?
There better not be.
Do I think there's gonna be trouble?
Well, there better not be any trouble.
PENELOPE: Why?
What happens if there is?
Well, where are you gonna put on your next show if there is trouble here?
The bands have to work with the promoters of these shows or it just won't work at all.
And we're only too happy to work with them.
I think I understand what pogo is,
I put on a couple of shows out here and they've come off with no real problems.
PENELOPE: Yeah.
The last show l was out here, you had a cat that had, uh, long, blond hair.
And soon as uh...
Well, he did not understand as you're pointing out.
He did not understand the difference between pogoing and... and real violence.
There is no actual difference, violence is violence.
But, I mean, if they're bashing each other and enjoying it, well, that's up to them.
Um, the only performance that ever makes it and is a success is the performance that causes total madness.
Yeah, I don't really want to be a party to that.
PENELOPE: Dutch, what's the worst problem you ever had?
Uh, one time three guys came up on stage and they were hassling the lead singer for uh...
Exene, I believe it was, from the band X.
And they were trying to rip off her dress or something.
I had to go out and kick them in the face.
-[WALKIE TALKIE CRACKLES]
- PENELOPE: Yeah.
Go ahead, we'll talk in the back.
Go ahead.
MAN: Let's get them in place.
I want to get the doors open.
Okay, on location.
- PENELOPE: Okay, thanks a lot.
- Thank you.

[CROWD SHOUTING]
MAN: Whoo!
It's like...
When I go to concerts, it's like my friends get beat up by my friends, you know.
Then it's like fucked, you know.
'Cause it's like they're not beating up the rig ht people.
They're not beating up the fucking posers.
They're beating up just, like, just my friends.
It's fucked, you know.
It seems like little crowds, you know, they'll be dancing.
And they'll start punching and then they'll just like, move over to the side, you know, and it'll just go back and forth and back and you can't... you can't dance.
Like, when you see a fight, like, all these people start running over to the fight.
They don't care who it is.
They just start kicking.
You know, going, you know...
PENELOPE: Why do you think they do that?
Just to get aggression out, you know.
'Cause they're fucked.
I don't know.
That's why I do it.
Just to get aggression out.
All this fucking pent up shit.
And, uh...
They cut their hair and you know, they dye it.
Then they come up there and you know...
A lot of them cause problems.
You know, you see the young kids with their head shaved and they really get belligerent.
Short hair, you just see Am...
The clean-cut American look.
Man, it's just cool.
Yeah.
I put a guy in the hospital you know, a little while back.
PENELOPE: What happened?
Uh, broke his nose and his jaw.
I cut up his face.
They said I hit him with a chain.
I guess I did.
Just a little bit drunk.
Didn't remember.
What's the pent up aggression?
Where does that come from?
Well, with me, it just comes from like, living in the city and just seeing everything, seeing all the ugly old people and just the fucking...
The buses and just the din.
That, you know, it just...
That's what I see all the time.
So, just all the time you're fucking bummed.
You're just thinking about that, so when I go there, I just... sometimes I get out some aggression.
Maybe by beating up some asshole, you know.
There's a lot of violence in the music. There should be.
PENELOPE: Why are they so angry?
Um, they don't know.
I don't know.
You know, they think that's what punk rock is, violence.
A lot of people are afraid of me.
But that's just like, they go by appearance.
Guess I'm a scary looking person.
I've probably punched out everybody I know one time or the other, but I've always ran afterwards.
'Cause I'm...
I can't fight.
I like making a spectacle of myself.
I'm a total rebel.
I rebel against everything.
I guess I'm an alcoholic.
[CHUCKLES]
I just hang by myself mostly, you know.
Why?
Well, fuck, I don't know.
I don't know.
I'm just like that.
You know, I just like being by myself.
The police are all calling me names and they made me take a shower
'cause they said I smell.
They asked me why I don't wash my clothes more often.
I swear to God,
I hate cops to the max.
Sometime, when niggers come up to me, they're like, you know...
They'll wanna...
They'll go, "Hey!"
And then they'll start chasing me, like...
You know most times I ran.
Yeah, in LA I get chased a lot.
You know.
But it doesn't really mean I...
You know, I'm sure
I'm gonna go kill a Jew.
You know, I'm not gonna do that.
Maybe a hippie, though.
I mean, you know, the punks...
You know, punks against hippies, that's another thing if the hippies are starting it.
But then again, punks against punks, you know, that's not... that's not what it's meant to be.
In Hollywood, most of the people are like posers.
They're just wimpy, you know.
PENELOPE: When you fight, how do you feel?
When you're actually in a fight?
How do you feel?
Violent.
Yeah?
I feel very violent.
I feel like I'm doing something
I'm good at.
What?
Beating people up.
[LAUGHTER]
And everyone shouldn't be afraid to be as different as they want to be.
People hold back a lot.
I've probably hit lots of girls in the face.
I don't like girls very much.
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- No.
- How come?
- Don't have girlfriends.
Why?
Girls are terrible.
Now, I'm very good at hiding my feelings so I, I don't feel depression anymore.
It's easy for me not to do that.
I... It's easy to be very detached.
My mother's dead, so...
My step-dad, he's a cop.
You know, I haven't talked to him in a long time.
Seen him at the movies one night.
He didn't talk to me.
He walked away.
Acted like he didn't know me.
I don't know where my parents are.
- Where's your real father?
-Don't know.
Don't even know who he is.
Society stinks.
We were trying to change something.
The music industry, the way we live.
You know, to be accepted the way we want to, you know...
Why do you wear those clothes like that?
I'm comfortable.
At one time, maybe,
I was considered different, but now, I'm in a comfortable lifestyle and I can be myself.
Everyone's hair should be blue because that's the best color.
It looks... it looks so good.
I figure, when I get tired living the life I am now, think I'll go into classical music.
Is the time up now?
PENELOPE: Show me your head.
Why did you do that?
I'm an X-head.
Fuck!
[PLAYING PROWLERS IN THE NIGHT]
[PLAYING PROWLERS IN THE NIGHT]
People are longing
They keep disappearing
Their secrets are turning
Thinner than air
Watching your basket
Knowing it's stupid
You lift up the box lid
To see what you can
Prowlers in the night
Ready for the kiss-off
Than the fight
There is a light on of hidden reaction
The words mean to say
Kiss or fist
No easy answers
To unsolved questions
A string of opportunities missed
Prowlers in the night
Ready for the kiss-off
Than the fight
Laugh if you're able
They all die slow
Suicide reasons are stupid excuses
Everyone's saying there's nowhere to go
Prowlers in the night
Ready for the kiss-off
Than the fight
[P LAYING GLUTTONY]
A nice pot roast just dropped in
Dressed in clogs, your yummy friend
Watch the hunger pangs set in,
Watch the calories go marching in
ifs more mass gluttony
Add those pounds to hide the tears
Nights rise, dough boys crumble
But the need consumes us all
Munch and feed to heart's desire
Heartburn can only set us free
From gluttony, gluttony, gluttony
Wallow in your cow disease
Pay no mind to the salivating brood
Find your comfort in your food
[CROWD CHEERING]
PENELOPE: Wayne, can you tell me what you thought the first time you saw them dancing?
Well, to me, it was just another form of dance.
It didn't really surprise me because I've been a... a dance fan myself for many years and
I've probably tried most types of dancing.
But, the pogo dance is just exactly what the name implies, is people gyrating up and down in a vertical position as though they were in fact riding a pogo stick.
[LAUGHING]
But I can't say that
I was really surprised by it.
Well, I was.
I never saw anything like that in my life.
I thought they were starting something.
I don't know.
I just... It scared me.
PENELOPE: Why do you think they act like that?
It's an energy outlet.
It's...
They're really nice kids.
They just have to be doing something different.
PENELOPE: Yeah.
It's a release from their daily tensions, I guess.
- What ever that may mean.
- In our day we ate goldfish.
[LAUGHING]
Right.
LEE: I want all you assholes that are standing back there sucking that overpriced shit come up here, closer.
They wouldn't let us play here tonight they thought on account that we didn't play here a long time and they said the last time we played here there was a riot.
So, you're not going to disappoint us, are you?
Let's see a little motion up here.

Oh, it's, uh, it's a musical journey.
That's really what it is.
What the movie is... is about is when a band is developing, it goes through certain stages, and for us, like, we're not the same band we were when we recorded the War album, for instance.
And we captured that on
Under a Blood Red Sky, and we just wanted to capture this period of... of the band to...
Ah, fuck it. l don't know.
That's Larry doing the...

He felt the healing, healing
Healing hands of love
Like the stars shining from above
His hand in his pocket
His finger on the steel
The pistol weighed heavy
His heart he could feel
Was beating, beating, beating, beating

Thank you.
Well, we wrote the song l Still Haven't Found
What l'm Looking For, which is a gospel song pretty much. lt doesn't sound much like a gospel song the way we do it, but if you look at the lyric and the basic music, that's exactly what it is.
We got a cassette from a friend of ours at lsland Records of a gospel choir covering the song, and it sounded like-- lt sounded totally different, but it sounded really exciting and new.
So we traveled down to Harlem and visited this church in the middle of Harlem where this choir were going through a rehearsal, and we played with them and got the idea to do a kind of combination arrangement.

Jesus, say something l am someone l am someone l am someone
Captains and kings ln the ship's hold
They came to collect
Silver and gold
Silver and gold
Ooh
Ooh l see the coming and the going l've seen them captains and kings l've seen their navy blue uniform
See them bright and shiny things
Bright and shiny things
Yeah
The temperature is rising
The fever white-hot
Mister, l ain't got nothin'
But it's more than you got
Chains no longer bind me
Not the shackles at my feet
Outside are the prisoners lnside the free
Set them free
Set them free
A prizefighter in a corner is told
Hit where it hurts
For silver and gold
Silver and gold
Yeah.
Silver and Gold.
This song was written in a hotel room in New York City... round about the time a friend of ours,
Little Steven, was putting together a record of artists against apartheid. lt's a song written about a man... in a shantytown outside of Johannesburg...
A man who's sick of looking down the barrel of white
South Africa, a man who is at the point where he is ready to take up arms against his oppressor...
A man who has lost faith in the peacemakers of the west while they argue and while they fail to support a man like Bishop Tutu...
[Crowd Cheering] and his request for economic sanctions against South Africa.
Am l bugging you? l don't mean to bug you.
O.K., Edge, play the blues.
[Crowd Cheering]
[Woman]
Have you already started writing for this next album, and being so influenced by American music, will it incorporate some American music?
We went to Sun Studios in Memphis.
Even though it's been a barbershop and even though it's been a few other things, like a store, the exact same studio exists and even the same tiles.
And we got Cowboy
Jack Clement down.
He recorded
Jerry Lee Lewis'
Whole Lotta Shakin'
Goin' On.
And we recorded five new songs in five hours.
[Playing Angel Of Harlem]
[Bono]
Angel Of Harlem.
[Music Stops]
[Man]
Larry Mullen, Jr. l don't have a mike on.
You don't know what l'm saying.
[The Edge] lf l had those feet, l wouldn't want them in the film. lf l had a head like yours, l'd bleedin' bury it.
[Playing Angel Of Harlem] lt was a cold and wet
December day
When we touched the ground at JFK lt was sunset over Uncle Sam
Charlie and the birdman
And Angel
New York like a Christmas tree
At night, this city belongs to me
Angel
Soul love
This love won't let me go
Oh, oh, oh
So long
Angel of Harlem
Blue light on the avenue
God knows when they got to you
Strung out, you learn to sing
Your eyes swollen like a bee sting
Birdland on 53
The streets sound like a symphony
We got John Coltrane and the Love Supreme
Miles, and she's got to be
An angel
Soul love
Well, this love won't let me go
So long
Angel of Harlem
Mmm, hmm, hmm
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah
Well, when you're on the road for that long, sometimes you just feel like doing something that isn't on the schedule and just shaking it up a bit. lt's just, like, music can get so boring, so conservative, so predictable.
[Crowd Cheering]
We've got a flatbed truck set up in front of the plaza with your gear.
Whenever you're ready, we can go.
We're ready right now.
We've got to work out
All Along the Watchtower.
Who do we know that knows the words to
All Along the Watchtower?
There must be some way out of here
What's going on?
We could try it in C.
There must be some way out of here
[Adam]
B, C, A-flat--
A-sharp, rather.
[Playing
All Along The Watchtower]
O.K.
"There must be some way out of here"
Said the joker to the thief
"There is too much confusion here"
"l can't get no relief" l think that's close. ls that O.K.?
Are we going?
[Adam]
Let's go.
[All Along The Watchtower

"There must be some way out of here"
Said the joker to the thief
"There is too much confusion here"
"l can't get no relief"
"Businessmen, they drink my wine"
"Plowmen dig my earth"
"None of them know along the line"
"What any of this is worth, yeah"
"No reason to get excited"
The thief, he kindly spoke
"There are many among us, yeah"
"Who think that life is but a joke"
"But you and l, we've been through that"
"And that is not our fate"
"So let us not talk falsely now"
"Because the hour is getting late"
Hey, hey, hey
Uh, uh, uh
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While her husband came and went
Barefoot servants, too
Yeah.
"Rock 'n' roll... stops the traffic."
All l've got is a red guitar
Three chords, and the truth
All l've got is a red guitar
The rest is up to you
"There's no reason to get excited"
The thief, he kindly spoke
"There are some among us here"
"Who say that life is just a joke"
"You and l, we've been through that"
"And that is not our fate, at least today"
"So let us not talk falsely now"
"Because the hour is getting late, late"
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ln God's Country.
[ln God's Country Begins]
Desert sky
Dream beneath the desert sky
The rivers run, but soon run dry
We need new dreams tonight
Desert rose
Dreamed l saw a desert rose
Her dress torn in ribbons and in bows
Like a siren, she calls to me
Sleep comes like a drug ln God's country
Sad eyes, crooked crosses ln God's country, yeah
Yeah
Naked flame
She stands, a naked flame l stand with the sons of Cain
Burned by the fire of love
Burned by the fire of love
Whoa, oh, oh,
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, whoa
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
That was good.
Really smashing the cymbals there, huh?
You want to change this?
Pass me a tissue please, Fintan.
Thank you.
[Bono]
Right, with the B.B. King song, watch for the third verse.
Not the first verse, the first chorus, not the second verse--
But the third verse.
But the third verse, which comes after the chorus. l start to count.
Then you come in.
Keep looking at me.
Stand beside me.
We should all look at Larry?
Just be in the right.
Make sure because when we get on there, so we're all prepared, just stand beside me-- boom, and in-- because Edge is on a completely different timing, as usual.
[Bono]
Let me introduce to you-- l'd like to introduce to you somebody whose music we've just come to know and love over the last year or so and his incredible band.
This is B.B. King and B.B. King's band here.
Where's B.B.?
Believe it or not,
B.B. King came to Dublin, lreland.
He was playing in this club in Dublin, lreland, and we wrote this song for him. lt's called
When Love Comes To Town. l went to listen to the tape. l was able to kind of get some of it together. l hope you liked the song. l love the song. l think that the lyric is really...
Real heavy lyrics.
You're mighty young to write such heavy lyrics.
Ha ha ha!
You know, l'm one of those rebel-like guys. l like to get in there and see what's going on.
Break the mold a little.
That's right. Yeah.
They kind of... look at me kind of weird.
They say,
"Here he is, a 62-year-old, and look what he's trying to do."
You're 62?
Yeah, l'm 62. l'm no good with chords, so what we do is... get somebody else to play chords, and--
Well, Edge will do that.
There's not much chords in this song. l think there's only two. l'm horrible with chords.
[Band Playing Quietly] l don't know what to do there. l'm just-- l'm just--
Go ahead. yeah.
Was that a joke?
Ha ha! l was a sailor, l was lost at sea l was under the waves before love rescued me l was a fighter, l could turn on a thread
But l stand accused of the things l've said
When love comes to town l'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town l'm gonna catch that flame
Baby, l was wrong
To ever let you down
But l did what l did
Before love came to town l used to make love under the red sunset l was making promises l was soon to forget
"Pale as the lace on her wedding gown."
Are you scared?
"l left her standing before love came to town."
Ran into a juke joint
When l heard a guitar scream
The notes were turning blue
And l fell into a dream
As the music played l saw my life turn around
But that was the day before love came to town
When love comes to town l'm gonna catch that train
When love comes to town l'm gonna catch that flame
Baby, l was wrong
To ever let you down
But l did what l did
Before love came to town
Hey, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
"l held the scabbard when the soldier drew the sword. l threw the dice when they pierced his side, but l've seen love conquer the great divide."
When love comes to town, l'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town, l'm gonna catch that flame
Baby, l was wrong to ever let you down
But l did what l did
Before love came to town
[Bono]
Thank you. Good night!
Ha ha ha!
All right.
Might as well go for it.
[B.B.]
Lot of emotion right there.
That's all right, young man.
That's all right.
See the sun rise over her skin
Don't change it
Woo!
See the sun rise over her...
Yo!
Thumb a lift there, Edge.
Dawn changes everything
Everything
And the Delta sun
Burns bright and violent
Mississippi and the cotton wool heat
66, a highway speaks
Of deserts dry
Of cool green valleys
Gold and silver mines... l was a little bit disturbed about going to Graceland, to be honest, because unlike what some of the other guys are saying, l loved the Elvis movies. l used to watch them because it was great to see a film star who was a musician. ln every single one of his movies, he wasn't acting as a car salesman.
He was acting as a car salesman who loved to play guitar. l really related to that because l worked myself for a couple of years. l was a glorified messenger boy, but l loved to play the drums. l related to that. l loved the Elvis movies.
Over her skin
She feels like water in my hand
Freeway like a river cuts through this land lnto the side of love like a burning spear
And the poison rain brings a flood of fear
Through the ghost ranch here
Can we get a photograph on the bike?
Um, well, we can--ha ha!
How about the snowmobile?
The snowmobile.
Well, this man--
What Harley-Davidson means to this man, you would not know.
[Woman]
How about--
How about off-camera?
That would be fine.
Just like a personal photograph.
We'll keep this away.
O.K., you can do that. ln this heartland
Heaven knows, this is the heartland
Heart, heartland,
Hey, yeah
Heaven knows, this is the heartland
Heartland
Heartland l was worried that our involvement, that us going to Graceland would take away from him and take away from us.
When l got there, l enjoyed it and all that, but seeing the graves and, like, the eternal flame and all that just seemed-- it seemed very distant. l wish he hadn't been buried in there-- in the, uh, back garden. l really wish that he'd been buried somewhere where l couldn't have gone. l would have felt better. l don't know why. lt's just one of those things, you know.
[Bad Begins] lf you twist and turn away lf you tear yourself in two again lf l could, you know l would lf l could, l would let it go
Surrender
Dislocate lf l could throw this lifeless lifeline
To the wind
Leave this heart of clay
See you walk, walk away lnto the night
Through the day lf l could, through myself
Set your spirit free l'd lead your heart away
See you break, break away lnto the light
Through the day lnto the half-light
Through the flame
Singing
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

So let it go, uh-huh

Wide-awake l'm wide-awake
Wide-awake l'm not sleeping
Oh, no l'm not sleeping lf they should ask
Well, maybe they'd tell me what l should say
True colors fly in blue and black
Through silken sky and burnin' flag
Colors crash, collide in bloodshot eyes lf l could, you know l would lf l could, l would let it go
This desperation
Separation
Condemnation ln temptation lsolation, revelation lsolation, revelation

[With Or Without You Begins]
See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side l'll wait for you
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails, she makes me wait
And l wait without you
With or without you
With or without you
Through the storm, we reach the shore
You give it all, but l want more
And l'm waiting for you
With or without you
With or without you, oh l can't live
With or without you
Yeah, you
And you give yourself away

There are--There are people who would say that you shouldn't mix music and politics or sport and politics or whatever, but l think that's kind of bullshit.
[Crowd Cheering]
[The Star-Spangled
Banner Playing]
[Bullet The Blue Sky Begins] ln the howling wind
Comes a stinging rain
See it driving nails lnto the souls on the tree of pain
From the firefly
Red-orange glow l see the face of fear
Running scared in the valley below
Sky
Whoo
Sky...
Whoo
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue
Bullet the blue ln the locust wind
Comes a rattle and hum
Jacob wrestled the angel
And the angel was overcome
You plant a demon seed
You raise a flower of fire
See them burning crosses
See the flames, higher and higher
Sky
Whoo
Sky...
Whoo
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue
Bullet the blue
Yeah
All right... now it's you.
So this guy comes up to me
His face red, like a rose on a thorn bush
Like all the colors of a royal flush
And he's peeling off those dollar bills
Slapping 'em down
And l can see those fighter planes l can see those fighter planes
Across the mud huts where the children sleep
Through the valleys and the quiet city streets
We take the staircase to the first floor
We turn the key and slowly unlock the door
A man breathes into his saxophone
And through the walls, we hear the city groan
Outside, it's America
Outside, it's America
So back in the hotel room
With John Coltrane and the Love Supreme ln the next room, l hear some woman scream out
That her lover is turning off
Turning on the television
Well, l can't tell the difference
Between ABC News,
Hill Street Blues
And the preacher of the Old Time Gospel Hour
Stealing money from the sick and the old
Well, the god l believe in lsn't short of cash, mister l feel a long way
From the hills of San Salvador
Where the sky is ripped open
And the rain pours through a gaping wound
Pelting the women and children
Pelting the women and children
Who run...who run... lnto the arms...
Of America
[Crowd Cheering]
[Running To Stand Still Begins]
And so she woke up
She woke up from where she was lying still
Said l--l gotta do something
About where l'm going
Step on a steam train
Step out of the driving rain
Maybe run from the darkness in the night
Singing ha, ha la la la de day
Ha la la la de day
Ha la la de day
Mmm
Sweet the sin
But bitter the taste in my mouth l see seven towers
But l only see one way out
You got to cry without weeping
Talk without speaking
Scream without raising your voice
You know, l took the poison
From the poison stream
Then l floated out of here
Singing ha, ha la la la de day
Ha la la la de day
Ha la la de day
Oh...ooh
Ooh, oh
She runs through the streets
With her eyes painted red
Under black belly of cloud in the rain ln through a doorway she brings me
White gold and pearls stolen from the sea
She is raging, she is raging
And the storm blows up in her eyes
She will suffer the needle chill
She's running to stand...
Still l'm still running
Still running
Still running, yeah l'm still running
[Audience]
Still running

Still running

Still running
Still running

[Crowd Cheering] l don't-- l'm not even sure that that song should be in the film--
Sunday
Bloody Sunday-- because l-- you know, that day, the day of the Enniskillen, uh...bombing, you know, will soon long since be forgotten, and people will not understand the way we felt onstage.
[Crowd Cheering]
Well, here we are, the lrish in America.
[Crowd Cheering]
The lrish have been coming to America for years... going back to the great famine when the lrish were on the run from starvation... and the British government that couldn't care less... right up to today.
You know, there are more lrish immigrants here in America today than ever-- some illegal, some legal.
A lot of them are just running from high unemployment.
Some run from the troubles in Northern lreland, from the hatred of the H-blocks, the torture-- others from wild acts of terrorism like we had today in a town called Enniskillen, where 11 people lie dead, many more injured, on a Sunday, bloody Sunday.
[Sunday Bloody Sunday Begins]
Ooh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh l can't believe the news today l can't close my eyes and make it go away
How long, how long must we sing this song?
How long, how long?
Tonight
We can be as one
Tonight
Broken bottles under children's feet
Bodies strewn across a dead-end street
But l won't heed the battle call
That puts my back up, my back up against the wall
Sunday bloody Sunday
Sunday bloody Sunday
And this battle's yet begun
There's many lost, but tell me, who has won?
Trenches dug within our hearts
Mothers, children, brothers, sisters torn apart
Sunday bloody Sunday
Sunday bloody Sunday
How long, how long must we sing this song?
How long, how long?
Tonight

Oh!
[Bono]
Yeah
Yeah
And let me tell you something. l've had enough of lrish-Americans who haven't been back to their country in 20 or 30 years come up to me and talk about the resistance, the revolution back home... and the glory of the revolution and the glory of dying for the revolution.
Fuck the revolution!
[Crowd Cheering]
They don't talk about the glory of killing for the revolution.
What's the glory... in taking a man from his bed and gunning him down in front of his wife and his children?
Where's the glory in that?
Where's the glory in bombing a remembrance day parade of old-age pensioners, their medals taken out and polished up for the day?
Where's the glory in that?
To leave them dying or crippled for life or dead under the rubble... of a revolution... that the majority of the people in my country don't want?
No more! Sing!
[Audience]
No more
No more
No more
No more

Good night.
God bless you.
You say you want
A diamond and a ring of gold
You say you want
Your story to remain untold
But all the promises we made
From the cradle to the grave
When all l want is you
You say you'll give me
A highway with no one on it
Treasure just to look upon it
All the riches in the land
You say you'll give me
Eyes in a moon of blindness
A river in a time of dryness
A harbor in the tempest
But all the promises we make
From the cradle to the grave
When all l want is you
You say you want
Your love to work out right
To last with me through the night
You say you want
Diamonds and a ring of gold
Your story to remain untold
Your love not to grow cold
Oh, the promises we break
From the cradle to the grave
When all l want is you
You l want is you
All l want is you
All l want is you
I always was a rebel.
But, on the other hand, I want...
to be loved and accepted by all facets of society...
and not be this loudmouth, lunatic poet-musician.
But I cannot be what I'm not.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
People say, "Why are you recording your life like a diary?"
The thing is that, as a Beatle, every song and every album...
and every record and every film was a diary of who we were at the time.
But we were in the dark about it till later.
So when I got with Yoko...
we were able to turn a light on in the middle of the creation of it.
The back is going to be eyes with two sunsets in it.
Freaky, isn't it?
What's the tune of lmagine?
It just goes, "Imagine there's no heaven...
"it's easy if you try. No hell below us.
"Only sky. Imagine all the people.
"Living for today." Whatever.
You'll hear the record.
When I think of Ascot,
I think of making Imagine...
and also just being together, strolling around in the gardens.
And it was a very intense and beautiful time for us.
- I should do How? First.
- All right. Set up How?
We built a studio connected to the house...
and we recorded some songs there, too.
I was raised by my auntie.
My father and my mother split when I was about 4.
I had spent some time with my mother up till about 4.
Then my father split.
He was a merchant seaman.
You can imagine, it was the 1940s, in the war and all that.
And he left, and I was brought up by an auntie.
I had to be solid because I had a boy to bring up.
It was my job to be there.
He never came into an empty house.
What he could not make out was how I knew... when he was up to something.
He was inventive and was always the leader.
Every time he sat down, he never wasted a minute.
And it was always either drawing or writing poetry...
or reading. He was a great reader.
And he sang himself to sleep every night.
And then when I was 16...
I re-established a relationship with my mother for about four years.
She taught me music.
She first of all taught me the banjo... and, from that, I progressed to guitar.
And then, unfortunately, she was run over by an off-duty policeman...
who was drunk at the time.
I lost her twice. Once as a 5-year-old when I was moved in with my auntie...
and once again when I was re-establishing a relationship with her.
That was really a hard time for me...
and it just absolutely made me very, very bitter.
The underlying chip on my shoulder
I had as a youth was really big then.
It was very traumatic for me.
I had no idea about doing music as a way of life...
until the rock 'n'roll hit me.
Then when rock 'n'roll hit me that changed my whole life.
You know, you went to see those movies... with Elvis or somebody in it, when we were still in Liverpool.
And you'd see everybody waiting to see him. And I'd be waiting there, too.
And they'd all scream when he came on the screen.
So I thought, "That's a good job."
He was rough, ready... and not my type at all. To start off with.
But again, this enigmatic character... you couldn't resist.
He was like a Teddy boy.
He walked around without his glasses... a guitar over his shoulder... and a look that said, "Kill."
Paul met me the first day I did
Be Bop a Lula live onstage.
A mutual friend brought him to see my group, called The Quarry Men.
And we met and we talked after the show.
And I saw he had talent.
He was playing guitar backstage...
doing Twenty-Flight Rock, by Eddie Cochran.
And I turned around to him right then on first meeting and said:
"Do you want to join the group?"
And I think he said "yes" the next day.
Now George came through Paul...
but the person I actually picked as my partner was Paul.
Hamburg? That city of sin?
No, certainly not. You can't go there.
He said, "Oh, come on, Mimi.
We'll get 100 pounds a week. "
So in the end, he went.
I can remember the time when one drunken Kraut... tried to get onstage and John Lennon was eating onstage... and he threw his knife at him.
And then, not deterring the fellow... he promptly kicked him in the face to boot him off the stage.
And so you had this town full of gangsters...
who used to love the Beatles...
and used to send them crates of ale onstage.
And they'd be legless.
Absolutely legless onstage.
Everywhere they played, they would finish up in a fight.
In actual fact, one place that I sent them to play...
they used to have to hide behind the piano...
because the popular thing was to throw the chairs at the group.
Then we went back to Liverpool, and there were quite a few bookings.
You know, they all thought we were German.
Anyway, Bill was from Hamburg, and they all said, "You speak good English."
I was told that he was playing in a place called The Cavern.
It was an old wine cellar...
that had been turned into a sort of lunch club.
It was Brian that went there.
And he was only at the back of the hall...
listening to those four boys, but whatever he saw...
he saw that little spark.
And he went right around and offered himself as their manager.
I was immediately struck by their music, their beat... and their sense of humor, actually, onstage.
And even afterwards, when I met them...
I was struck again by their personal charm.
And it was there that, really, it all started.
It took about eight months to... get to the stage where we had a recording contract... and we were having the first record issued.
That was Love Me Do.
I think it was a very fortunate coming together... that we seemed to hit it off very well.
When we were in the studio, we did really collaborate as a team.
There weren't any egos protruding through.
But I was very, very lucky to have met up with them.
George had done no rock 'n'roll when we met him...
and we'd never been in the studio, so we did a lot of learning together.
He had a very great musical knowledge and background.
So he could translate for us and suggest a lot of things. Which he did.
And he'd come up with amazing technical things.
When the Beatles were depressed, thinking the group was going nowhere...
and this is a shitty deal, and we're in a shitty dressing room...
I'd say, "Where are we going, fellas?"
And they'd go, "To the top, Johnny!"
And I'd say, "Where's that, fellas?"
And they'd say,
"To the toppermost of the poppermost!"
And I'd say, "Right!"
Then we'd all sort of cheer up.
When I was a Beatle...
I thought, "We're the best fucking group in the goddamn world. "
And believing that is what made us what we were.
It was just a matter of time before everybody else caught on.
Thank you.
For our last number,
I'd like to ask your help.
For the people in the cheaper seats, clap your hands.
And the rest of you, if you'd just rattle your jewelry.
We'd like to sing a song called,
Twist and Shout.
Maybe we should just go on and do lmagine, then.
What's this one, a ballad?
Yeah, go on. I'll teach you it.
Imagine was one facet of him.
It crystallized his dream for the world.
It crystallized his idealism.
And it was something that he wanted to really say to the world.
That's a nice one.
Yeah.
- That's the one I like best...
- What if there's another piano?
Because if we get the same kind of piano, and do an octave higher or something...
- it would be beautiful.
- We can always use this...
Instead of the electric guitar.
It's a delicate song.
He could do it on the top half of the piano, maybe.
We could get a mike through to the front...
That's it.
- The white piano?
- Yeah.
I'll go on the white one 'cause that's what I wanted to do, use that one.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Because we want to do the house.
When Dad moved to Tittenhurst...
it was the first time that he actually called me in quite a long time.
It was an exciting thing for me to go and see him again... after not seeing him for such a while.
And at the time, I was living in...
I won't say a small house, but it was a completely different situation.
It was on a street with lots of houses, lots of friends.
And Tittenhurst was this enormous... palace-like place with 99 acres... golf-cart buggies, a lake, a little island in the middle of the lake...
It was like a house of fun.
It was a completely different experience.
It was wonderful. I loved the place.
I don't remember seeing him as a child.
It was the height of the Beatle thing so I was working all the time.
I never considered what it was doing to him. I didn't even count it.
The mother was at home. I was away.
Like most guys at 24 or 25, they're too intent on their career really, you know.
John, as a father, was forced,
I'm afraid, to be a part-time dad.
He wrote to me saying that...
"I'm so sad and I'm so sorry that I've missed the fact...
"that Julian has been growing up...
"that he is now a little man and I miss him dreadfully.
"And I've been a right bastard...
"because I've taken no notice of him...
"and I've read the papers and pushed him out of the room...
"because he's been making noises."
That was the point when he suddenly realized that he was a father...
Julian was a special little person... not just a figment of his imagination when he came home in the early days.
You're going over to the States early in the new year... and you're going to top the bill on the Ed Sullivan coast-to-coast show.
John, so far, all
British pop stars have not made a tremendous impact on the States.
How do you think you're gonna fare?
Well, I can't really say, can I?
I mean, is it up to me? No.
I mean, I just hope we go all right.
Are you going to vary your act at all for the American audience?
No. We haven't really got an act, so we'll just do what we do.
The journey to America was exciting but I had to keep a low profile...
because it wouldn't do for the frenzied fans...
to know that John had a wife and a baby at home.
What do you think of the comment... that you're nothing but a bunch of British Elvis Presleys?
It's not true!
Are you going to get a haircut while you're here?
- No, thanks.
- I had one yesterday.
- That's no lie. It's true.
- It's true.
You know, I think he missed some.
- No, he didn't.
- You should have seen him the day before.
What do you think your music does to these people?
It pleases them, I think.
It must do, 'cause they're buying it.
- Why does it excite them so much?
- We don't know, really.
If we knew, we'd form another group and be managers.
We came here at 6:00 in the morning, 5:30, to see them.
And all they did was push us farther and farther away.
Then they don't even let you see them.
I got every Beatle record at home and we didn't get to see them.
What kind of police protection?
I'd really like to get a piece of them...
It was like being in the eye of a hurricane.
You thought, "What's going on?"
And, "How did I get here?"
The last thing I remember was playing music in a club, and the next minute, this.
Did you ever have a chance, John, to just get away, on your own... without anybody recognizing you?
We borrowed a couple of millionaires' houses.
Sure we did.
You could afford to buy a couple of millionaires' houses, couldn't you?
We'd sooner borrow them. It's cheaper.
We did a bit of water skiing.
Well, sort of, anyway.
Did your wife enjoy it over there?
She loved it. Who? Who?
Don't tell them he's married.
It's a secret.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
There was no sort of particular security...
and one of our assistants told us that there was this strange guy...
that was just staying in our gardens almost every night.
John always felt responsible for these people...
because they were the result of his songs.
That's how he felt.
Don't confuse the songs with your own life.
I mean, they might have relevance to your own life, but a lot of things do.
So we met, you know. I'm just a guy.
I write songs.
I figured that if we met.
I'd know, just by meeting you.
Know what?
That it all fits.
Anything fits, if you're tripping off on some trip.
Anything fits, you know.
Like when you said:
"Boy, you're going to carry that weight for a long time." That was just...
- That's Paul who sang that.
- Paul sang that?
But that belongs to all of us.
He's singing about all of us.
Remember that one:
"You can radiate everything you are.
You can penetrate anywhere you go?"
Yeah, I was just having fun with words.
It was literally a nonsense song.
I mean, Dylan does that.
Anybody does that, you know.
You just take words, and you stick them together... and see if they have any meaning.
Some of them do, some of them don't.
See, that last album of mine was me coming out of my dream.
You can last your whole life on that dream, you know... and then it's all over.
You weren't thinking of anyone in particular when you were singing all that?
How could I be?
How could I be thinking of you?
I don't know, maybe, I don't care, me.
But it's just all... It's all somebody.
I'm thinking about me or, at best, Yoko, if it's a love song.
I'm saying, "I had a good shit today and this is what I thought this morning...
"and I love you Yoko," or whatever.
I'm singing about me and my life... and if it's relevant for other people's lives, that's all right.
You hungry?
Yeah.
Let's get him something to drink.
Finally, I've got it.
It's great working with you, Phil.
Really great.
I've worked with a lot of cats in my time... and I want to say, really great.
Sincerely, really great.
Don't you think the Beatles gave every sodden thing they've got...
to be the Beatles?
That took a whole section of our youth, that whole period.
When everybody else was just goofing off...
we were working 24 hours a day.
The whole Beatle thing was just beyond comprehension.
And I was eating and drinking like a pig...
and subconsciously was crying for help.
Shea Stadium was a happening.
You couldn't hear any music at all.
But then it just became like lip-syncing, miming.
Sometimes things would break down and nobody'd know.
Last month, 75 teenagers from Pennsylvania... petitioned Her Majesty, the Queen, to have the Beatles knighted.
Well, this hasn't happened.
But today, I'm pleased to say that they have been made members... of the most honorable
Order of the British Empire.
Congratulations, John, George,
Ringo, and Paul.
How did you all react to this?
Well, I went...
Which means in sound?
Whoopee.
You all live in, well, good domestic splendor.
Has this affected your writing,
Paul and John?
No, it's easier to write with cushions,
I'm sure... than on pieces of hard bench.
But you know we were on hard benches before we met... a known terror of Liverpool.
It's much easier on a nice cushion.
From obscurity in a cellar in Liverpool four years ago...
and now to Buckingham Palace.
We're all delighted.
- Thank you very much.
- Congratulations.
The Beatles arrived in Japan today, as their tour of the Far East continues.
Across the Pacific, in the United States, a furor is developing over comments...
John Lennon made: "Christianity will go.
"It will vanish and shrink.
We are more popular than Jesus. "
Here in Tokyo, violence broke out when right-wing fanatics...
demonstrated against the Beatles and their effect on Japanese youth.
This is Tommy Charles.
If you, as an American teenager, are offended by statements...
from a group of foreign singers, which strike...
at the very basis of our existence as God-fearing, patriotic citizens...
then we urge you to take your Beatles records...
pictures and souvenirs to the pick-up points about to be named.
And on the night of the Beatles' appearance in Memphis, August 19...
they will be destroyed in a huge public bonfire...
at a place to be named soon. Stay tuned to Rocky for further developments.
Now this religious controversy...
I know that you don't want to say too much about it... does it worry you it's gonna boil up when you get to the States?
It worries me, yes, but I hope everything will be all right in the end, as they say.
I think the Beatles are a real talented group... but I think they need to watch what they say because... they're in such a position that a lot of teenagers... really think of them as something really big.
When they say things like that... some teenagers are gonna just believe anything they say.
I'm not saying that we're better or greater... or comparing us with Jesus Christ as a person... or God as a thing, or whatever it is.
I just said what I said, and it was wrong, or was taken wrong. And now it's all this.
Did you mean that the Beatles are more popular than Christ?
When I was talking about him, it was very close and intimate with this person... that I know, who happens to be a reporter.
And I was using expressions on things that I'd just read, and derived... about Christianity, only I was saying it in the simplest form that I know... which is the natural way I talk.
What's the most enjoyable thing for you four about this adulation... this almost godhood on earth that you've achieved?
Don't say that.
- It was him. He said it.
- You all saw that.
The Ku Klux Klan, being a religious order... is going to come out here the night that they appear at the Coliseum here.
And we're gonna demonstrate with... different ways, tactics, to stop this performance.
We are known as a terror organization and I think we have...
A terror organization?
We have ways and means to stop this, if this is going to be the case.
What ways and means?
I don't want to say this, but there will be a lot of surprises...
Monday night, I believe, when they get here.
You officers that are stationed... in front of the stage, behind the barricade... you will go to Mr. Morris Shapiro, the first-aid man... and he will furnish you with earplugs... so as to keep you from having a headache.
If he runs out of earplugs, he has got some cotton.
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.
The music wasn't being heard.
It was just...
a sort of freak show.
The Beatles were the show, and the music had nothing to do with it.
The only reason to be a Beatle was to make music...
and not just to, sort of, be in a circus.
After the Beatles'last tour...
which was the one where the Ku Klux Klan were burning...
Beatle records, and I was held up as a Satanist or something...
then we decided, no more touring.
That's enough of that.
But I was really too scared to walk away.
I was thinking, this is like the end, really.
There's no more touring.
That's when I started considering:
"What the hell do you do all day?"
So I said yes to Dick Lester...
that I would make this movie with him and went to Altamira, Spain for six weeks.
At a studio in London...
the Beatles have just come together for the first time in four months...
to record some songs.
The songwriting team, they will keep going on, whatever happens, will it?
Yeah, we'll probably carry on writing music forever... whatever else we're doing,
'cause you just can't stop.
You find yourself doing it whether you want to or not.
Do you think the tours, like the American tours and the English one...
It stands in England?
There must be a point where they don't work anymore... because they're not to do with what we're doing... record-wise or film-wise.
Before we did Sergeant Pepper, we were given a license to kill, so to speak...
because we were already successful.
And I knew that I could do in the studio just what I wanted.
And I knew that they wanted to experiment a bit more.
So we just let our hair down and went for broke.
In fact, when I say Pepper, I mean
I'm starting off with Strawberry Fields...
which was the beginning ofPepper, although it wasn't on the album.
That was one of the great songs he did.
I really wasn't aware of their taking drugs much before that.
I was aware of them smoking pot.
And even during the Sergeant Pepper bit...
I wasn't too sure about what they were doing.
I didn't really want to know,
'cause I didn't approve of it.
And they were rather like school kids.
They used to keep it away from me.
If they wanted to go and have a drag of a smoke... they wouldn't do it in the studio.
They would nip into the canteen and lock the door... like naughty boys in the lavatory.
They would go away and hide, away from the schoolmaster.
Surrealism had a great effect on me
'cause then I realized that...
my imagery in my mind wasn't insanity.
Psychedelic vision is reality to me.
Some newspaperman came up and he said, "Have you had LSD?"
So I thought,
"I'll either be cagey here or be honest."
So I said, "Yes."
And it was his responsibility, reporting it.
So they had him on TV saying,
"Why did you say this?"
Very much like that statement...
They kept asking him, "Did you take it?"
So he says, "Yeah."
But on TV, he says,
"You don't print this bit of film.
"I don't want to tell anybody about that.
It's private"...
Almost like the situation with the Christ statement.
But see, they just asked me a question. I gave them an answer.
And then it was blown up.
I mean, you know, I just spoke the truth and it's sometimes painful.
This is the truth.
My son came home with a drawing... and showed me this strange-Iooking woman flying around.
I said, "What is it?" He said,
"It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds."
I thought, "That's beautiful."
I immediately wrote a song about it.
The song had gone out, the whole album had been published... when somebody noticed that the letters spelled out "LSD."
And I had no idea about it.
And, of course, after that I was checking... all the songs to see what the letters spelled out.
They didn't spell out anything.
None of the others.
It wasn't about that at all, you know.
The terrible news came that Brian had died.
Apparently, he'd taken an overdose.
We were so shocked because
Brian was such a kingpin...
of what was going on in our lives.
He was the father figure.
And, all of a sudden, that had finished.
That really sent things into chaos.
Tickets, please. Thanks very much.
Following a lecture that everybody had been to, to see the Maharishi...
they were invited to go to Bangor for a weekend...
to do meditation and to feel the experience of meditation.
I think they needed a break from the madness.
So we all ended up getting on a train to Bangor, for this trip.
And I, as usual, was trailing behind with the hand baggage.
And a massive policeman put his arm out and stopped me.
I couldn't get on the train. And the last thing that I saw was John's head.
I can't imagine what he was saying, but it was probably pretty rude about...
"For Christ's sake, Cyn, you're too slow again. Why couldn't you run with us?"
And at that point I just felt, "That's it."
Somehow, I can't explain it.
And normally I would not have broken down.
I would have been pretty cool and calm... and I knew that I would get there anyway.
But at that point, I just felt so sad... that this is symbolic of our life now.
It's like,
"I'm getting off at this station."
And it was pretty true after that.
Yoko was having an art show in London at a gallery called Indica Gallery.
And I heard this was going to be a happening.
So I went down the night before the opening.
And the first thing that was in the gallery...
as you went in there was a white stepladder...
and a painting on the ceiling and a spyglass hanging down.
I walked up this ladder and I picked up the spyglass.
It was balancing there.
And in teeny little writing it just said "yes."If it had said "no"...
- or something nasty...
- Something nasty.
Like "rip-off," or whatever, I would have left the gallery... but because it was positive, it said, "Yes"...
I thought, "This is the first show I've been to that said something warm to me."
Then I decided to see the rest of the show, and that's when we met.
We didn't really get together till 18 months later.
She came over for a date, as it were...
I had a little studio, which was really just a lot of tape recorders.
And we made Two Virgins and I was showing her...
all my different tape recordings, and all that.
I thought, "This is great."
And I was going...
on the tapes, and she was going...
And we did, we made a tape all night.
And in the morning we made love as the sun came up.
"Surprise, surprise."
We shot the cover ourselves, privately, and put out Two Virgins.
And it was a kind of statement as well, an awakening for me, too.
This is me, naked, with the woman I love.
When you were with the Beatles... you didn't express yourself politically at all, did you?
On our first tour... there was a sort of unspoken thing... that Mr. Epstein was preventing us talking about the Vietnam War.
And before we came back the second time to America...
George and I said to him:
"We don't go unless we answer what we feel about the war."
'Cause you were being asked?
'Cause we were asked about it all the time... it was just silly, and we had to pretend to be like in the old days... when artists weren't meant to say anything about anything.
"When you talk about destruction, count me out... in."
What did you mean by that, John?
That means I'm not sure. I really think... if it gets to destruction, you can count me out, but I'm not sure.
I'm human and I'm liable to change, or depending on the situation.
I prefer nonviolence.
Yesterday, John Lennon and his girlfriend, the Japanese actress, Yoko Ono...
were arrested and charged with the use of marijuana.
And today they were arraigned here, at Magistrate's Court, in London.
He's the one who's known as the most "way out" of the Beatles.
Right now, John Lennon is looking very hard for his car...
because if he doesn't get to his car, he's likely to be mobbed.
John, Cynthia is better than her!
That girl next to me just a moment ago said, "Cynthia is better than her."
Initially, when we met...
I think there was a feeling of... not really wanting to get together.
Because... we knew this was a big one, both of us... and we didn't want to get in.
And, then, when we got together...
I think we basically knew that it was going to be it.
And after that, it took about a year,
I think...
before we finally got married.
Yes, fortunately... we both agree.
Unfortunately, not always.
But in the end... we get into something and forget that we ever disagreed.
Fortunately, I met you at the right time.
Unfortunately, that's right.
But... in the end...
I wonder what's going to happen?
Fortunately, we don't know.
Fortunately...
I'm in love with you.
Unfortunately, I'm in love with you, too.
This is another peace protest, by the way.
Why the bag?
Because we believe in total communication.
That means, if we have something to say, or anybody has something to say... they can communicate and not confuse you... with what color your skin is, or how long your hair's grown, or...
How long is your hair?
You have to guess!
It is not important. It's only what I say, that's what we're here for.
All we're saying is give peace a chance.
Or if the least we can do is give somebody a laugh... we're willing to be the world's clowns... because we think it's a bit serious at the moment and a bit intellectual.
John Lennon, Man of the Decade.
Take one.
How hopeful are you about the future, John?
I'm full of optimism, knowing that there's other people around... who...
I can get on, agree with.
I'm not insane. I'm not alone.
That's just on a personal level.
Of course, the Woodstock, Isle of Wight, all the mass meetings of the youth... is completely positive for me.
And when I'm negative, I've got Yoko.
The '60s were just waking up in the morning.
And we haven't even got to dinnertime yet.
I can't wait. I just can't wait.
I'm so glad to be around.
And it's just going to be great, and there's gonna be...
You're driving it, too. I see.
Sorry. This is for love, I'm doing this, you understand. And for art.
- He just wanted to...
- For the sake of art.
If you think you know me or you have some part of me because of the music...
and then you think that I'm being controlled like a dog on a leash...
because I do things with her...
then screw you, brother, or sister.
You don't know what's happening.
I'm not here for you.
I'm here for me and her.
Is that the audience you're keeping out there?
I'll try and get them to let you in.
This way.
Can I put something to both of you... about this creative phase that you're both going through at present?
I think you've got to accept, John and Yoko, that, particularly you, John... that it's alienated you from the people who originally loved you in this country.
- A lot of them.
- They don't understand you anymore.
The alienation started was when I met Yoko.
And people do not seem to like people getting a divorce.
It's all right to do it quietly, but we can't do it quietly.
So everyone has this impression that John's gone crazy.
But all I did was fall in love, like a lot of people do... who are already married, who married somebody very young.
We're not superhuman and we really get hurt by abuse.
We don't mind criticism of our work at all.
But the British press actually called Yoko ugly in the papers.
I've never seen that about any woman or man... even if it was that the person is ugly.
You don't normally say it in the paper.
"That ugly woman." And she's not ugly.
And if she was, you wouldn't be so mean.
They even say "attractive" about the most awful-Iooking people, just to be kind.
That's the kind of treatment we were getting at that time... and it really hurt us.
John!
Yoko!
You're sending us the
"in the middle of the night" verse.
We don't want that one.
We want the one on clouds.
We're going to do the harmonies to "in the middle of a cloud" bit.
What's the matter with you, Philip?
It's the last fucking verse.
"In the middle of the cloud
I called your name.
"Oh, Yoko."
We stopped here once, remember?
That's the one you're playing now.
We don't want that one.
We want the one that he recorded afterwards.
"All new and free." That was from
"In the middle of a cloud," after the end.
He did a new version, remember?
- That's the one we want. Okay.
- We're just there. All right.
The end of the song is just like the fucking rest of it.
We're going to sing the harmonies to "Oh, Yoko." Come on!
Why don't you just forget about this, darling?
Relax until we say, "okay."
John, why don't you just sing it for him once?
Okay, now we'll deal with it.
Okay, let's go on to the next track.
Yoko and I... when we got together... decided that whatever... We knew... whatever we did was going be in the papers.
Whether it's Richard or Liz... or so-and-so gets married... or whatever people like us do is gonna be in the papers.
So we decided to utilize the space...
we would occupy anyway, by getting married...
with a commercial for peace.
And also a theatrical event.
And what we basically had was a seven-day...
press conference in bed.
It's a bed-in, folks.
The first day they fought at the door to get in...
thinking there was something sexy going on.
And they found two people talking about peace.
Even if you can beat the establishment at their own game...
I don't believe in that game. I think the only way to do it is Gandhi's way.
That's nonviolent, passive, positive or whatever they call it these old days.
Is there not a more positive way of demonstrating in favor of peace... than sitting in bed eating three square meals a day...
Now, it's a different age.
It's gimmicks and salesmanship.
And if that's what'll put it across, that's the way to do it.
Whether you're protesting against the conditions you live in... or the conditions you work in, or the conditions of the whole world.
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah, sure.
Okay. Okay Rog.
I think we got the message over, Roger.
I think the message is catching on.
The peace message.
Chuck, don't you think so, the peace message is catching on?
Right, he thinks so. We met a lot of groovy people, made some good contacts.
- Right?
- For tomorrow?
For tomorrow? Who knows?
I'm a dreadful Neanderthal fascist.
How do you do?
John and Yoko, meet cartoonist Al Capp.
We've had all sorts in here.
I'm sure you have.
One of the things that had... interested me was that you said that you were very shy people.
Yes, we are.
And yet, these are...
- Does that prove you're not shy?
- Certainly not.
Only the shyest people in the world would take pictures like this.
Do shy people...
Do they ever become naked or not?
You think that people that are shy...
Am I quarreling with your description of yourselves?
If that isn't a picture of two shy people...
I'd like to know what shyness is.
- What filth!
- Do you think that's filth?
Certainly not.
I'm denouncing people who think it is.
I think that everybody owes it to the world to prove they have pubic hair.
And you've done it.
You've done it and I tell you that I applaud you for it.
If you want to prove it, you can prove it.
Why don't you prove it now...
I don't feel that there's any great interest in it.
Clearly, you must have felt the world wanted to know... what your private parts looked like.
And now the world knows.
I tell you that's one of the greatest contributions... to enlightenment and culture of our time.
I'm glad you noticed.
I wanna thank...
I wanna tell you it's hard not to notice.
Now you have a song and one of the lines, and correct me if it isn't:
"Christ, it ain't easy. Everywhere I go, they're gonna crucify me."
Rubbish. I didn't say it. The lyric goes:
"Christ, you know it ain't easy.
You know how hard it can be.
"The way things are going, they're gonna crucify me." And you, baby.
This isn't my song.
These don't express my...
We are all together in this world.
Let's face it. You and I are married together in this world.
You see, it's like being stuck in...
That is a very unkind thought to plant in my mind.
I want to tell you that this may stay with me... and I'll wake up screaming.
This is not true.
You say that to him, not to me.
That's your paranoia.
Everybody's married in this world...
No, it's just a matter of taste.
What do you want to know?
In the lyric, you said they were going to crucify you.
- Yeah. If you take it literally.
- How did you mean it?
- It means everything you want it to mean.
- What did you want it to mean?
They're gonna crucify me and you and everyone else.
But you said,
"They're going to crucify me."
- Lf you're gonna take it literally...
- Me is you.
Me... And I say that we're all one.
I didn't permit you to speak for me.
Who are you speaking for?
I took that liberty, Mr. Capp.
It's too much of a liberty...
I was speaking on behalf of the people in general...
- in a poetic sense.
- You're speaking for yourselves...
As a representative of the human race...
I'm speaking for us all whether you like it or not.
Whatever race you're the representative of, I ain't part of it.
Maybe yours is the human race and mine is something less hirsute.
But whatever race, it's your race.
- You belong to a race on your own.
- Everybody in this room... represents humanity.
Everybody in this room.
No, you don't represent me, though.
You don't write songs for me.
I want to make that clear to all of Canada.
Especially for you.
I'll let Kate Smith sing my songs.
Who do you write your cartoons for?
I write my cartoons for money.
Just as you sing your songs.
Exactly the same reason.
And exactly the same reason much of this is happening, too... if the truth be told.
You think I couldn't earn money by some other way... by sitting in bed for seven days, taking shit from people like you?
I could write a song in an hour and earn more money.
Now look here, don't say this.
You got into bed so people like me could come and see you.
But not for money, that's what you're saying.
It won't do you any real harm... except you might get some bedsores.
But I could earn money in more easier ways than doing this.
I tell you what would do you harm.
So could I.
I could make a lot more drawing people like you, than confronting you.
And I must say it's much more appetizing drawing them... because I can leave them.
I prefer singing to doing this but I'm doing this for a good reason.
What you've just done is when you said:
"Taking shit from people like you."
Now, I was invited here.
You knew I was coming.
- Yeah, sure.
- That's right.
So we're not doing it for money.
- You indicated...
- You haven't any manners at all.
And you have manners?
- I'm your guest. And, really even if...
- And I'm yours.
No, you're not! This is your bedroom!
Mr. Capp, may I say one thing?
I'd be delighted with any conversation.
Okay. I'd like to add to that...
Good God, you've gotta live with that?
It's good to just...
Nice guy.
I can see why you want peace.
God knows you can't have much.
I'm delighted to have met you,
Madame Nu.
You are our answer to Madame Nu...
It was great meeting you, Barabbas.
But I'm sure the other three guys... the other three fellows are Englishmen.
What does that mean?
- You think about it.
- Get out.
I'll try to work it. Now, Derek.
Oh, really, come on!
But I'm not having these people insulting you.
Leave it. We asked him here. He's right.
Forgive me.
Look, Derek, it's not for me to forgive you, it's for your psychiatrist.
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going they're gonna crucify Capp
Okay. A one, two. A one, two, three, four.
When John hitched up with Yoko... he said, "Yoko is now a part of me.
"In other words, as I have a right and left hand, so I have Yoko. That's me.
"And wherever I am, she is."
That was a bit difficult to deal with.
Suddenly, she would appear in the control room.
Nobody would say anything to me.
I wasn't even introduced to her, but she would just sit there...
and her influence would be felt.
To begin with, everyone was irritated by it.
By the time we got to Let it Be, we couldn't play the game anymore.
We could see through each other...
and therefore we felt uncomfortable.
Because up till then, we really believed intensely in what we were doing...
and the product we put out.
Everything had to be just right.
And we believed.
Suddenly, we didn't believe.
I don't mind. I'll play whatever you want me to play.
Or I won't play at all, if you don't want me to play.
Whatever it is that will please you,
I'll do it.
So we couldn't do it anymore.
It came to a point where it was no longer creating magic.
And the camera sort of being in the room with us made us aware of that.
That it was a phony situation and that was the end of it.
Out of that frustration came the crazy idea...
to do a concert on the roof above the Apple offices.
Of course, none of us had the vaguest idea...
that would be the last time the Beatles would ever perform together in public.
Now, does this mean a business or emotional split... within the Beatles?
Actually I think a bit of both.
But I think it's more of a break.
He asks this himself... but doesn't know if it's temporary or permanent. That's the truth.
I think none of us know that.
His financial interests in Apple and the organizations will stay?
Yes. Contractually they have to... and I think emotionally they'd all want it to.
They never argued about money.
What are the personal differences that he refers to in...
I don't know.
It's probably to do with growing up.
There was a time when there were just four of them.
But now they're married and there are children.
Will anyone ever replace the Beatles for you?
- No.
- No.
It's just one Beatles group. That's it.
There could never be another.
- What is it about them?
- We grew up with them.
They started when they were younger, and we were younger.
And all through these years we've just developed with them... and grown up with them.
They, like, belong to us, you know?
But there could never be another Beatles. Never.
Yoko, is that a fresh pot of tea?
- Yes.
- It's fairly fresh.
This is actually a Beatle wife fixing the tea... for one of the fab four ex-Beatles.
- Fab three.
- Fab three.
I see Beatle Phil making a pig of himself.
You see much of the Beatles these days, other Beatles?
I saw a Beatle. Beatle Ed.
- Beatle Ed. How is he?
- He was all right.
But he was just going off on a tour.
Beatle Ed's not doing too well these days, is he?
- He's number five in Sweden.
- In Sweden, I see.
Paul wrote some song that was...
like a private message. So to speak.
John was upset about those songs.
And so that's how it happened.
It was, like, a reply to Paul, rather than a message to Paul.
Okay. Stop.
I wrote a sort of song of How Do You
Sleep? On Walls and Bridges.
I can't remember the name.
Steel and Glass, which I thought was about a few people.
But then I realized, no, it's me again.
It's not about Paul. It's about me.
I'm really attacking myself.
But I regret the association.
Well, not really regret.
He lived through it.
The only thing that matters is how he and I feel about those things.
And not what the writer or the commentator thinks about it.
Him and me are okay.
Great.
I am a very busy housewife, to put it mildly.
Oh, no! They have to say that it was all a hoax.
What was?
"Lennon lie-in."
"Dear Mr. Lennon. From information
I received while using a Ouija board...
"I believe that there will be an attempt to assassinate you.
"The spirit that gave me this information was Brian Epstein.
"He said the attempt will be made in place on March 6...
"Mr. Epstein also said that Paul McCartney was alive in London."
"John Lennon doesn't affront the queen by sending back his MBE.
"He doesn't make ha'penny's worth of difference...
"to attitudes on Biafra or Vietnam.
"Or to the place of his drug-orientated record in the charts.
"He makes an ass of himself."
- We waited for hours.
- Remember me?
If I'm going to get on the front page...
I might as well get on the front page with the word "peace."
But you've made yourself ridiculous.
To some people. I don't care...
- You're too good for what you're doing.
- Lf it saves lives...
You don't think... My dear boy, you're living in a never-never land.
You talked to a...
You don't think you've saved a single life?
What do you know about a protest movement, anyway?
I know a lot about it.
It consists of a lot more than... sending your chauffeur in your car back to Buckingham Palace.
You're just a snob about it!
The only way you can make...
You're a fake!
Can't give up something that means a little more?
It was no sacrifice to get rid of the MBE, it was an embarrassment...
Then what kind of protest did you make?
- You said I don't know what this...
- It is an advertising campaign for peace.
- Can you understand that?
- No, I can't.
A very big ad campaign for peace.
I think it's vulgar and self-aggrandizing.
Are you advertising
John Lennon or peace?
Do you want nice, middle-class gestures for peace?
And intellectual manifestos... written by a lot half-witted intellectuals?
And nobody reads them. That's the trouble with the peace movement.
I'm someone who admired you very much.
I'm sorry you liked the old mop-tops, dear... and you thought
I was very satirical and witty.
And you liked Hard Day's Night, love, but I've grown up.
- But you obviously haven't.
- Have you?
Yes, folks.
John Lennon stopped during his busy peace campaign today...
to give an interview in which he spoke candidly about drugs.
It's no good us preaching at people and saying:
"Don't take them," because that doesn't work.
It's like the church telling you not to drink or not to have sex... when you're a kid. There's nothing on earth that's going to do it.
But if people take any notice of what we say... we say we've been through the drug scene, man... and there is nothing like being straight.
But you need hope, and hope is something... that you have to build up within yourself.
London police today confiscated a number of erotic lithographs...
by pop musician and artist, John Lennon.
A local district court will rule...
as to whether the art is pornographic...
and whether or not it can displayed publicly.
But even with drawings and things.
I have been talking to Yoko.
And she convinced me that anything
I draw or write...
is just as important communication-wise.
I shouldn't just show it to friends.
I should put everything out.
While we were living in New York... we started to see the resemblance between New York and Liverpool.
And the docks, the piers, you know.
I said, "This is like going back to Liverpool. It's a big Liverpool. "
I've met a lot of New Yorkers who complain about it, but nobody moves out.
It's the greatest place on earth.
Documents released today reveal that a massive FBI investigation...
in the early 1970s...
was part of a government effort to deport John Lennon.
You don't think there's any possibility that... the government is trying to harass the Lennons?
Absolutely not. This is the kind of treatment we would dish out... to anybody convicted of a narcotics offense.
When it first started,
I was followed in a car.
And my phone was tapped.
And people thought I was crazy then.
They do anyway, but I mean more so.
"Lennon, you big-headed maniac, who's going to follow you?
"What do they want?"
That's what I'm saying.
What do they want? I'm not going to... cause them any problem.
Everywhere John went, people asked him that question...
the one about the Beatles getting back together.
And even though we were friends...
I was a reporter at that time and the question was almost obligatory.
Will they ever team up again?
It's quite possible, yes. I don't know why the hell we'd do it, but it's possible.
- Would you like that to happen?
- Lf it happens, I'll enjoy it.
Would you want to initiate that happening?
I don't know, Elliot. 'Cause you know me.
I go on instinct.
If the idea hit me tomorrow...
I might call them and say,
"Come on, let's do something."
I couldn't really tell you.
If it happens, it will happen.
So, it is not something you'd totally rule out as never taking place again?
No. My memories are now all fond and the wounds are healed.
If we do it, we do it.
If we record, we record. I don't know.
As long as we make music, you know.
Crowds have been gathering all day...
in anticipation of
John Lennon's appearance...
here tonight for a charity concert.
John has rarely been seen onstage...
since the Beatles' final tour six years ago.
Ladies and gentlemen, John Lennon!
By then it was getting very obvious...
that the world didn't want us to really work together.
So, it was 1973. I just felt like saying to John:
"Look, why don't you just go to L.A.
And have fun?
"Leave me alone."
I just wanted to think straight, because I couldn't think straight anymore.
She had literally said, "Get out."
And I said, "Okay, I'm going."
I had been married before Yoko, and I immediately married Yoko...
so I've never been a bachelor since I was 20 or something.
So I thought, "Woo-hoo!"
The lost weekend was a combination of a remarkable party... an exercise into the depths of foolishness... and, I think, John's last effort to assert his manhood.
I think it was his departure... from his innocence and from his youth... to becoming a man, to becoming serious... to wanting to be with Yoko, to having a child.
And this is...
Some people have bachelor parties.
John had a lost weekend... that went on for 14 months or however long it went on.
Clearly it was necessary for somebody to be with John...
and Miss Pang seemed like a logical choice.
Nothing gets done with John unless there's somebody there.
And Yoko suggested that she would be the ideal companion...
for John for this mission.
That lost weekend that everybody keeps talking about, it wasn't so lost.
People saw more of John than they had in the previous years.
And he was out and about a lot.
He had recorded several albums...
starting with Mind Games to Rock 'n'Roll to Walls and Bridges.
And he worked with Ringo on his album.
There's also David Bowie... when they collaborated on...
David Bowie's first number one hit song, Fame.
And also Elton John, when we went to Caribou. So there was a lot going on.
We had a lot of fun.
There was Keith Moon, Harry, me,
Ringo all living together in the house.
We had some moments, folks.
But it got a little near the knuckle.
I hit the bottle like I was 18 and 19...
and I was acting like
I was still at college.
The only terrible thing...
that I can say about John Lennon is he was an absolutely miserable drunk.
He could not stop once he started.
Two Brandy Alexanders, and he was absolutely charming, delightful... told the old stories, was witty and lovely.
By the third... he started to snarl, and after that, he was uncontrollable.
It was the first night
I had drank Brandy Alexanders...
which is brandy and milk, folks.
And I was with Harry Nilsson, who didn't quite get as much coverage as me.
They just sort of said, "Okay...
"you better leave, Mr. Lennon."
And then they took me out.
It was a mistake but, hell, I'm human.
I was drunk in Liverpool and smashed phone boxes... it didn't get in the papers then.
Fred Astaire and Ginger Beer!
All right, dancing over with.
- We've done the dancing one.
- Let's make the commercial now.
I'm gonna impound all those photos till I get my green card.
I was out of control and nobody was looking after me.
I needed somebody to love me.
There was nobody there to support me and I fell apart.
The worst was being separated from Yoko...
and realizing that I really, really needed to be with her...
and wanted to be with her...
and could not, literally, survive without her.
Sean was born on October the ninth...
which I was, so we're almost like twins.
It's a pleasure for me to hang around the house.
I was always a homebody.
But I think a lot of musicians are.
I've been so locked in the home environment...
and completely switched my way of thinking...
that I didn't really think about music at all.
My guitar was hung up behind the bed, literally.
I don't think I took it down in five years.
The fact that my father... almost completely stopped his musical career to raise me.
It makes me feel good. I know that.
He would play music around me.
I never really registered that he was a Beatle...
until I saw a movie called Yellow Submarine.
And I just put it together.
I would ask about it. He would say,
"Yeah, this is the Beatles.
"I was a Beatle, but that's over now."
"That's over now and I'm spending time with you."
What's your favorite part of the circus?
I like the clowns and the little dogs.
Would you give it all up to run away and join the circus?
I've already given it up, but I haven't decided where to run, though.
Say hello.
Hello. We're having lunch on Sunday, April the 12th.
Hello, we're having lunch on TV!
I'd go through periods of panic because I was not in the Billboard...
or being seen at Studio 54 with Mick and Bianca.
I didn't exist anymore.
And I realized there was a life without it.
I thought, "This reminds me of being 15."
"I didn't have to write songs at 15.
I wrote it if I wanted to. "
That's when I suddenly could do it again with ease.
All the songs that are on Double Fantasy all came within a period of three weeks.
When I was singing and writing this and working with her...
I was visualizing all the people of my age group.
I'm singing to them. I'm saying,
"Here I am now. How are you?
"How's your relationship going?
"Did you get through it all?
"Wasn't the '70s a drag?"
"Here we are. Let's try and make the '80s good. "
- John Lennon, can I have your autograph?
- Yeah.
I got to shake your hand, man!
What's up, man? I can't believe I met you.
I swear to God.
When are the Beatles getting back together?
Tomorrow.
You're full of it.
When are you getting back together?
I love your album. I like your blue album.
- Hey, who's that guy?
- John Lennon, from the Beatles.
I can't believe it.
It's not out of our control.
I still believe in love...
peace, I still believe in positive thinking.
While there's life, there's hope.
Because I always considered my work one piece...
and I consider that my work won't be finished...
until I'm dead and buried.
I hope that's a long, long time.
There was a lot of feeling of premonition, when you look back at it now.
But I was very worried about him.
And... in fact, I told John:
"It's getting very busy.
"And it's a strain on us.
"The schedule is a strain on us and I think you need a rest.
"And you and Sean should go back to Bermuda."
And... he said, "Not this time.
"I'm going to be with you, no matter what."
And... that's how it was.
John Lennon shot yesterday in front of his New York apartment building...
Residents say a man in his late thirties had been waiting for hours...
He died in the emergency room at Roosevelt Hospital...
... once called the guiding spirit of the Beatles, dead tonight at the age of 40.
There was no... there was no wall facing us anymore.
There was always something in between us... but it had been knocked down.
We could actually...
"Hi, Dad, I'd like to come see you.
Is that okay?" "Yeah."
It's hard to explain emotions... in dealing with... that situation especially... especially when we were... getting so close.
His music... will live on forever in my heart and in many people's hearts.
Because it was so vulnerable.
It showed such a vulnerable man... who cared so much about people and expressed himself so well.
The first few years after his death...
I would always cry when I heard the music.
But now I got over it.
The thing I miss most about him is just him being around... taking me places, doing things with me, talking with me.
He tried to show me how to play the guitar once. It didn't really work out.
Just his presence was all I needed.
He was my husband, he was my lover.
He was my friend.
He was my partner.
And... he was an old soldier that fought with me.
English
Reality.
You mean, this is the real world?
I never thought of that.
My mother and I, we had a house in Chicago.
We figured... we'd get out of there, you know, while the getting's good.
And so, then when I got to Vernon...
I called up these real estate people.
They sent me their phone number.
So then I see the picture.
The property was $2,200.
Of course, it was cheap.
They claim it was too much.
Well, it wasn't too good.
It wasn't a castle... but it was a house. Five lots.
So, okay, bought it.
Had a mortgage for four years, paid off... so I don't have to pay no rent, see?
No taxes.
Old age?
No taxes.
You gotta like outdoor sports.
And I've always loved it.
Especially turkey hunting.
I killed my first turkey when I was 10 years old.
I can't tell you how many I've killed, but I've killed a lot of them.
I run a business. I close the business down if I have to... to go turkey hunting.
It's just something that I like.
It's just in me.
I can't tell you how I feel.
It's just a hell of a sport, that's all.
Sometimes you can be standing around and hear one jar the ground.
And you just look at the roads and fire trails... untiI you pick up fresh tracks and know which way he's going.
And just go to that area, stop, listen... and hope that you hear one.
Sometimes they gobble quite often, early.
Sometimes it's 5, 10, 15 minutes.
And later on in the morning, sometimes it's every 30 minutes.
You just can't tell.
They're a smart bird.
The smartest we got in this country.
See now, we spend time like this day in and day out... and not hear nothing.
But you know they're here.
I sent them two checks.
One check for $12, a three-year membership... and $3 insurance.
So I waited. I don't know,
I waited a month or longer... and I didn't get no answer from them.
So then I had this lady copy the checks, you know, on the copier?
So then I sent the copies to them, and now they sent me the jeweI, see?
I don't know if the jewel is genuine or not. Take a look.
I don't know what I'm looking for.
I don't know.
What does a jeweler look for?
You know, those guys, when you go into a jewelry store?
If you want something examined, they look through a lens.
What are they looking for?
You ask them, they'd go...
You ever seen a man's brains?
I've seen them.
I've picked them up, scooped them up.
Put them in, do them up like brains.
You buying brains?
But there's a ball right here, and there's a ball here.
A ball here and a ball there.
Now, they're connected to the spine, the spine goes down the backbone.
And if all four... of these balls or brains is functioning... you're not a one-track mind.
You're a four-track mind.
And you can...
I've seen a lot of folks.
They can type one letter...
Write me a letter and you a letter on a typing machine.
And write one way with this hand... write your letter with this hand, and my letter with that one.
And I can take a penciI and sit down and write...
"cat shit" with this hand and "dog shit" with that one.
Both at the same time.
Two pencils.
I've done that lots of times.
These brains...
Now, what I was telllng you... if I can't stand up...
I don't believe, without propping against something.
It gets me out of balance.
There you go. You run one...
Now, if you ain't got that... and I've often, all over this town, time and again... pointed out to anybody that would listen.
If you run that foot in a circle this way, and then your hand that way... then just pick up your pistol and keep wiggling your arm... and singing a song.
That's four, in other words, that's five things.
That's five things I can do on this.
On one, with this old knot up here.
Good tire.
Vernon-30 to ControI.
Go ahead.
Quincy, can you give me the correct 10-36?
By my watch it's getting to 17.:31.
That's a big 10-4. Appreciate it.
We don't have too much traffic coming through now.
Sit here, watch them come shooting off the end of that bridge a little bit.
About the only thing I do this time of day... sit around and wait.
You have to do this in a hurry... because you have to cover several places at one time.
Not at one time, but... as quick as you can, because theygobblE better... earlier part of the morning.
The later in the morning it gets, the less theygobblE.
So you usually kill by...
6:00, 7:00 at the latest.
There's been a lot killed after that.
That's the cream of the hunt.
From daylight to 6:00, 7:00.
He's looking for a fresh track now... and if he finds a fresh track, he'll stop, listen, and go in on it.
That's what he's doing.
Walking and listening, right now.
Looking for a fresh sign he's crossed the graded road.
Where there's smoke, there's fire, you know.
You find a fresh track, you know there's agobblEr there...
'cause this is a prime area for turkey.
Look how that's bogged down there.
Bogged an inch deep there in that dirt.
He weigh 18, 20 pounds.
Look at the size of the track.
Look how he's bogging up that hard dirt.
He probably crossed late yesterday afternoon... and roosted right back down here in these woods.
If he's got a hen with him, it's very hard to call him away from that hen.
You can believe that.
Anybody that'll tell you they can... call agobblEr away from a pack of hens, just anytime...
Did you hear that?
Sounds almost like a turkey gobbling, but it's not.
It's one of them big woodpeckers pecking.
FooI you a lot of times.
Occasionally, you'll call a biggobblEr... away from some hens... but very seldom.
I'd rather not even try to call one away.
Well, you always try, but you can't do it.
I never have.
Very seldom.
I have different areas
I like to sit around and wait.
I sit here a lot of times.
Since this car was sitting around so much... a lot of people, they don't know for sure... if we have a police officer on duty here or not.
I can sit here and catch a lot of them as they come across the bridge... or come down through town.
Like this tanker.
He sounds like he's getting on it now.
Try to hold them down.
I hate to have to get out and chase every one of them down... but I try to let them see me sitting here.
So then, if I have to write them up... it's their own fault, because they can see me sitting here.
I'm not trying to hide now.
But there is a few places I sit around where you can hardly see me.
That's for my radar gun, when I have it.
I don't have it with me today.
I had to send it back in and get it recertified.
So I'm waiting for it to get back here.
It should be in Friday or Saturday... and then I can sit out here and catch a bunch of them.
They said he was 65 years old.
I don't know about that now.
That's a long life for a mule.
But he eventually died.
They rooted him over into that pond.
Just an old skeleton Iying there with the hide all on him.
Just as tough as anything you ever seen.
And a big hole in his throat here... where the buzzards and things had eaten... every bit of him as they could.
They couldn't eat him all.
I was a-fishing in there one day... and dropped my bait down there at that hole... that old mule laying in there, you know, all puffed up.
Dried up on the skeleton.
And there was a big warmouth perch run out him up here and bit my hook.
Took it in, that old mule, that quick, you know?
And he got off of there. Got loose.
I went to pull the hook out... and I must have hung it on one of his ribs in there.
I had to break it off.
But I put on another hook... and dropped it down there and I caught a big one.
The bones had come out of his legs, the skin was laying there.
And it was tough as a bear.
I got over, it was about this deep in the water.
I went down and then got a hold of them legs... and drug that old mule out on the hill.
There was 114 warmouth in him, warmouth perch.
I could hear them a-fluttering just 'cause I run out on the hill with it.
The water run out of him.
I could hear them a-fluttering in there.
It was in planted pines.
But he'd roosted in a branch, the other side of planted pines.
I eased into a row of planted pines, you know.
Planted pines.
They're not exactly in a straight row like that.
They'll be, you know, offset.
So you got a variation about 2 foot, maybe.
And getting in planted pines,
I walked across the rows... crossways to the rows, till I got right even... with where he was at in the swamp.
And I knew. I said, "Right yonder he's at. "
I walked crossways to the rows till I got to that row.
I knew he was right at the end of it.
I was working my way in and out.
And I slipped up there.
I slipped up close enough to the branch.
I could see the turkey in a pine tree.
He was a-gobbling.
I got to that pine, and I looked.
It was about 30 foot over there to that other pine.
And it was about 25 to 30 foot more to the turkey.
I looked at that turkey, and I looked at that open spot.
I said, "There ain't no way
I can get no further. "
I just eased that gun up reaI slow behind them pines.
And eased down.
And, lo... there he is, right there. I think he's got about an 11-inch beard.
He hit the ground.
It sounded like a ton of bricks.
Now, this here is a gopher.
He's not a turtle.
He's harmless. He won't bite you.
I don't know just how come him to be way down in here.
He don't like this kind of land here.
It's a high, dry, sandy land for him.
And he'll dig his den to be as far as...
20 feet deep sometimes.
And he's good to eat, too.
I don't eat him, but people do eat him.
He's just a fine piece of meat for the dining table.
I believe he wants to walk now.
His motor's slow-paced.
I said, "Y'all just leave my gun here.
I got to use the bathroom.
"You've got to come back this same way. "
And they said, "Yeah. All right. "
I got my gun.
I didn't get to use the bathroom, though. I was fixing to... but right out in them pines
I heard onegobblE.
And they'd done left.
And I said, "My God. "
Boy, that's the best diarrhea medicine in the world.
You hear a turkeygobblE, you forget all about diarrhea and everything.
Headaches, everything.
That'd cure anything.
I grabbed my gun, and I tore out.
I must have went a quarter of a mile.
Went through a bunch of pines.
And he double-gobbled.
I knew right then that I had a pretty good chance of killing him.
Man, it hadn't been 30 minutes since one had been killed.
Bless your heart. The next time hegobblEd, there he was.
Right out there in that wiregrass and broom-sage.
I just yelped reaI low to him.
HegobblEd.
He was coming straight towards me.
He wasn't walking. He wasn't running.
It was sort of in a little fast trot.
I had a good blind in some palmettos.
I was sitting behind some palmettos.
I done had my gun on him.
When he got up there... he was walking a little too fast to shoot him, 'cause I wanted a sure shot.
And what I done, I just whistled.
And he stopped, and he looked... and when he looked up, that was the end of it.
That's him right there in the middle.
With about an 11-inch beard.
Now, this opossum.
I didn't catch him myself.
Another fellow did.
He was eating his chickens.
He caught him, and he brought him down here to me.
He said I was the only fellow that knew what to do with an opossum.
I'm gonna keep him for the fun day in Wausau... and sell him to the fellows.
They auction them off over there from $1,200 to $1,500.
That's a great price for an opossum, don't you know?
I'll put him back?
You've got to be carefuI with one of them things.
They'll bite you.
I've been bit by them.
I've been bit by everything there is in the country.
Wild game, you know.
Except a rattlesnake.
I was sure enough watching for him.
He just walked.
No rain in it. Got to looking.
And his track was in that track, that trailer track...
We had just talked to the man five minutes behind us.
The trailer made a track. We come out the same way he come in.
And you know, that's got to be a red-hot track...
'cause it's on top of that trailer track.
You understand what I'm saying?
We just talked to him behind us.
He's right out here.
Stepped outside, yelped one time, and he come right back, gobbling.
We started grabbing guns and getting into position.
And I told Snake. I says, "Snake...
"that turkey's not coming back across that road.
"There ain't no way he's coming back across that road.
"He's going the other way. "
We'd sit there and we'd yelp to him.
And he'dgobblE.
He'd go over this way, and he'dgobblE.
Go back that away, and he'dgobblE.
He wanted us to come on.
But we wasn't going on.
We was expecting him to backtrack.
And I told Snake he wouldn't backtrack and come back to us.
This went on for about half an hour.
I told Snake. I said, "I'm tired of this.
I'm gonna Kill that turkey. "
I yelped one time. And he double-gobbled.
And that's all I yelped.
And the next thing you know, here he comes.
Just gobbling all the way.
I shot him and he hit the ground.
I mean he was doing a da-do, bouncing around about 3, 4 foot high.
I run down there to pick him up, and he got up.
He had a broken wing, and I knocked him down.
I said, "God, he's fixing to get away. "
And I just tried to shoot his head.
I just shot a big old hole in the ground.
I missed his head, 'cause if I'd shot the whole turkey, he'd be in pieces.
And I missed him. He got out. He was going right down the pine run... and I said, "Well, one more shot. "
And I shot him and just rolled him over.
And it was cloudy, like I said.
During all this time and around in them pines, everything looks alike.
To me it does. Anybody else that's ever been in there...
You can't... Excuse me.
You can't tell where you're at.
I got in there.
And when I Killed the turkey...
I didn't know where I was at, you know.
I walked around.
I got lost.
I was hollering for Snake.
I'd walk the direction I thought it was.
I was going in the right direction. But in them pines, everything looks alike.
And I started hollering, "Snake," just as loud as I could.
And they know I was turned around.
And they sat up there just laughing like the devil at me.
And they wouldn't answer me or nothing.
But anyway, I drug that one out the next morning... after them two mornings before.
There his beard is.
About the same length.
About an 11-inch beard.
The one on the far right here.
Thirty-five, 40 years ago there weren't no wigglers.
These wigglers is kind of a new thing in this country.
These wigglers have been in here about 20-something years.
These wigglers is a new thing come in here.
I reckon they was here... but I don't know where they accumulated from.
I got the seed of these from
South Florida. That's where I got them.
This is not a regular wiggler...
Like everybody's got here.
This here is what they call an orchard-worm wiggler.
That's the reason people come here and wants to beat me out of them.
I don't know where all this water comes from.
You must have a lot of ditches up there.
Of course, if you're taking the history of Vernon... well, I can't tell you.
All I can tell you about the river is... somebody told me that boats used to come down here.
And I says, "That river must have been wider, you know. "
The creek they call it.
But they said no.
So, I mean, freight boats used to come down here.
Justlike freight on the Mississippi River.
But I don't know.
I can't figure it out.
Maybe they used big canoes.
There's a big red wiggler.
There's a wiggler that they call the eel worm.
And this orchard-worm wiggler.
Then they got a big ring-neck wiggler.
And then they got one they call the night crawler.
He weighslike that.
I've got some of them from up in Joplin, Missouri... and brought them down here.
They up there.
I brought up down here and put them in a little old bed I had yonder.
And they all left.
They crawI at night.
You can't keep them in a place.
They stay around in the edge of the swamp.
Out there, there's a lot of muddy water.
That reminds me of the story about the two sailors.
They were looking at the water and one says:
"It's a lot of water out there. "
And the other guy says,
"Yeah, that's just the top of it. "
Hey, those snakes out here, they can swim.
Be careful of that.
Those snakes can crawl over water like they're crawling over the ground.
My.
And some people, they says,
"You going swimming?"
You're swimming around, and then you look up... and you see this snake coming towards you. Oh, brother!
See that jump?
You know what kind of fish that was?
That could have been a garfish.
Usually, the garfish, they feed on top... and if there's little minnows on the top, they snap them up.
You ever see a garfish?
He's got a blLI aboutlike that, his nose.
And when he...
He usually catches what he goes after.
I've never studied no book on these wigglers.
What I know about them is just self-experience.
They got books on them, but them books is wrong.
They don't teach you right on them.
Teach you what kind of feed to feed them.
How to do them and all that.
And it's all wrong in my book.
Why he wanted to take his shoe off to pull the trigger, I don't know.
The very next damn day, after we was working...
And, he said, that day:
"That'll be the last thing I ever do, is to shoot myself. "
Which it was.
There weren't none of his brains working. Period.
I tell you, he had two shells laying under the slLI of the house.
He crawled under there and got them.
Come out and told his wife, says,
"I've got one for you, and one for me.
"We're going. "
She run him down and took one of them away from him.
He sat down in an old, homemade, straight chair... and he pulled his shoe off... and he set that gun barreI right there... and pulled the trigger.
Pulled his shoe off to use his big toe to-
Yeah, but, hell, if I was gonna do that
I'd reach down there with my finger!
What? It'd have moved his head from the gun barreI.
- No, it wouldn't have.
- He had to stoop over there...
He pulled his shoe off in order to use his big toe to-
Everybody don't do things alike, but that's the way he done it.
Knowing that the Lord had called me to preach...
I had to pursue what the Lord had placed me on this world to do.
So I started back into the ministry.
In this line of work, you don't have the finances you'd like to have.
You see things that you'd like to have... you sometimes wish you're back in a secular position making better money.
But then I have a better situation than most people realize.
When I have a need, I just pray for it.
Justlike the van that I have now.
I felt I had a need for it.
So I began to pray, and then I began to go price vans.
But I didn't feel like my prayers and the prices I found on the vans... just coincided the way they ought to
'cause they were far out of my reach.
But stlLI, I feltlike if the Lord wanted me to have a van, I'd get one.
So in the process, a couple of weeks after I'd given up the idea... of finding one that I could afford...
I ran into a man, and he had a van.
I was looking at it.
He gave me the price on it.
I told him, "That's out of my range. "
He said,
"I've got a friend over in Marianna...
"that has a brand-new '79 van.
"It's been on his lot for eight months...
"and he's priced it down to $5,000 where it can be bought. "
He said, "I know it can be bought for $5,000."
That's kind of the range I was looking for.
And sure enough, I called the man.
He brought it to me... and in the process of three hours,
I owned the van.
God made all things... that was made.
All things that was made.
And he looked on it, and pronounced it... good and very good!
He made all these things that we've got today.
And he said it was good and very good.
But you could go to the extreme on anything.
Make a hog of yourself.
But as long as you let it golike God intended it, you need never worry.
He'll give you power and strength and wit to take care of the deaI.
There was a huge oak right on the bank of the creek.
I went and stood under the oak and I said:
"Lord, I don't know if you want me to have this lot or not.
"But if you do, well, then you make it possible for me to have it. "
So I went along for over a year.
And I didn't know if the lot had sold or anything.
But a year later, I had as much money as the man was asking for the lot.
I went to him to find out if he stlLI had it. Sure enough, he did.
He said, "You know, it's really ironic.
I've had this thing sold three times.
"And every time that I've had it sold, something's come up...
"and the party that was going to buy it didn't go through with the deaI."
He says, "I hope yours goes through. "
I says, "It's gonna go through because
I know this is an answer to prayer. "
Sing the wondrous love of Jesus
Sing his mercy and his grace
In the mansions bright and blessed
He'll prepare for us a place
When we all get to heaven
What a day of rejoicing that will be!
When we all see Jesus
We'll sing and shout the victory!
I was reading Romans not too awfully long ago.
And over and over, this word "therefore"... which is the first word in our Scripture this morning, began to pop out at me.
And I begin to think about it.
Because I remembered somewhere back yonder when I was in school... that an English teacher taught me about the meaning of words.
And this word "therefore" had a specific meaning.
And I think, well, if Paul is using this word so many times... there must be a reason for it.
So immediately,
I went to Webster's Dictionary... and I began to look up what the word
"therefore" was all about.
And I found the word to be a conjunction.
Now, I had long forgotten what a conjunction was.
And so, as soon as I realized it was a conjunction...
I thumbed back through the dictionary to the word "conjunction"... to see what a conjunction was, and Webster's Dictionary said... that a conjunction is an indeclinable word... that connects two thoughts together.
And so I said, "What does this word
'indeclinable' mean?"
And so I looked up the word "indeclinable"... and found that it meant that it was unchangeable.
And so I found out that "therefore" was a conjunction... that could not be changed that connected two thoughts together.
And so, therefore, whenever I found this out...
I looked at that word again in the first verse of our Scripture, and I said:
"Paul must have said something that this word is connecting together. "
So let's see what it was.
And when I began to look back,
I found out... that Paul had used that word "therefore"... many times in Romans before this, and many times in Romans after this.
And so I really got interested, so I looked in my concordance... and I found out that Paul used the word "therefore"... over 119 times in his writing.
And so, I think, well, if he used the word "therefore" over 119 times...
I need to find out what the Greek says about it.
So I looked up what the Greek meaning was... and the Greek word was "on, " which had a triple meaning.
The first one was "accordingly"... the next one was "likewise then, " and "then therefore. "
Paul says,
"Therefore you receive the peace. "
So if you're here this morning, you're Christian... and you don't have that peace,
I'll tell you what's happened.
You have taken back over the controls of your life... and you're holding on to that... which you ought to leave in God's hands.
As a result, you've lost the peace of your salvation.
And you won't gain it back... until you have another "therefore" experience.
I thank God this morning for the
"therefores" of Paul, here in Romans.
Perhaps there's someone here this morning who's never received Christ... they've never let him come into their hearts by faith.
They've never said, "Lord, I want you to have your way in my heart. "
You know what God's way in your heart is?
God wants to come in and cleanse you from your unrighteousness... and make something beautiful out of your life.
He wants to forgive you of your sins.
And God says, "You, come on!
Just believe, and I'll forgive you. "
The most important thing about turkey hunting is knowing your woods.
You can snatch me, or snake up... and carry us off to a place that we're not famlLiar with... we don't know the woods, the country...
Hey, man, you're lost.
You'relike taking me out of Vernon and sending me to New York City.
You just can't do nothing with them.
Knowing the woods.
Knowing which way they traveI.
So, in fact, just knowing the woods is one of the...
Just knowing the range.
And when you go to a new part of the country... man, you're lost, or I am.
Any turkey hunter's lost.
I don't really know of any crimes that's going on here.
Justlike any town, anywhere you go... you're gonna have little incidents... of things popping up.
Like someonewill walk in one of the stores and might pick up an apple... or clothespins or bobby pins or razorblades or somethinglike this.
But this goes on in all towns.
Nothing really more serious than that.
Not at this time that I know of.
I traveled along the road, you know, with a fellow in a car... and I was looking, and I say, "Barney.
You see that water over there?"
And he says, "Yeah. "
Then we come right up to it, and there was no water there.
It was just a mirage. In other words...
Well, to be... scientific about it... the lights, or the rays, the light bends.
So, if you get a different reflection, say, for instance... maybe a diamond don't even shine.
Maybe it's just the way it's cut, and the way the light hits it.
It's justlike some day after the rain.
You take a picture of those drops on the trees, and you can see them.
It's almost more beautifuI than the diamond.
I was out here in these woods one night.
And I just had the feeling that someone was out there.
And I heard that someone had fired a couple of shots out there.
It kind of had me worried that someone was out there.
I didn't know whether my walkie-talkie was working right or not.
But one time I was worried, or scared, whatever you might want to call it.
But this'll happen to the best of them.
Sometimes you just have that feeling... that there's someone up-close to you, or trying to get to you... when you're outlike that by yourself.
I had the camera. And I was lucky.
I held the opera glasses against the lens of the camera, and snapped it.
Of course,
I just about judged where the...
I couldn't line it up any other way... because when you had the opera glass on the lens... you couldn't see nothing.
And I held it up and it turned out.
Now, I don't know if this is the moon or not. It lookslike some clouds.
I don't know if this is a star or what.
Well, no, it couldn't be that because...
That's a picture of the star.
I just took the camera and pointed it up there. I didn't even sight it.
And then I took the picture that way.
Of course, as you can see, that picture ain't too good.
It's a cheap camera, you get a cheap picture.
Luck, you know.
I mean, when something turns out, you say, "Gee, I'm lucky. " Right?
Well, of course... you see, when you have a camera and you point it at a certain...
Justlike if you had a gun, you don't shoot, do you?
If you had a gun and you pointed it at something... you're liable to hit what you're pointing at. Then again, you might not.
The bullet came in... at just about this angle and went into my seat here.
You see, I haven't had that repaired.
It's a small hole there.
It went in there and lodged in the back of the seat.
The county sheriff's office came out to investigate.
They had to dig it out of the back seat, out of the back part of the seat.
It came in at an angle from the road.
I stlLI don't know why they did it.
Probably just to frighten me a little bit.
I'm not one that's gonna frighten easy about things.
It don't bug you too much... but the closer you get on him, you want to make the Kill so bad.
It's in your blood, or you wouldn't be out here hunting.
And believe me, it's in mine, and Snake's, too.
And the closer he gets... it's justlike you're going to be electrocuted.
Each day, it comes closer... the tension bulLds up.
It bulLds up in me.
I don't realize it.
But it's always bulLding up.
And the closer it gets, the worse it gets.
And after a whlLe, it comes to a point that you forget about it.
When he gets right there on you,
I mean, you go blank.
You're concentrating on making the Kill.
And once you make the Kill... you shoot, run, get the turkey, or run him down or miss him.
Then all that tension... that's bulLt up in you... it makes me sick.
You get the dry heaves,like you get on a morning after a Saturday night.
The dry heaves from a drunk.
Gag and puke. Just gag.
It's nothing but your nerves bulLt up that's dying down.
That's all it is.
In four, five minutes, I'm all right.
Every star you see up there, maybe it is a world.
You know, I mean, it was made for some purpose.
You know, it's just up there, see, and maybe... in the future there'll be one Irish world... one German world, one Russian world... and one colored world.
I mean, each party has their own world.
But who knows?
You don't know God's plan.
Even Jesus Christ didn't know.
It says right in the Bible... that no man can find out the answer to that... when the end of the world is.
Well, not the end of the world, but the end of our world.
Our scheme of things.
Politicians, you know.
In a little town when you talk to somebody... and you tell them about the lights on the road, they're not blinking.
They don't want to take no responsiblLity.
I says, "Who do you call? DOT?"
They didn't know, see. They don't care.
They should run them out of town, on a ralL, tar and feathers.
Yeah, Ilike that.
That tar and feathers.
Boy, wouldn't youlike that?
To see some guy, or some kid that did something wrong... and they'd tar and feather him?
Well, he'd have something to think about, wouldn't he?
Next time we'll give you the hot seat, buddy.
I've never seen anything more perfect in my life... than to see the perfection of God himself.
You hear so much.
That thing just happened.
That just happened.
Folks think that way all the time.
"That just happened. "
There was an old fellow talking to me in that house up yonder.
He said,
"There ain't no such thing as a God. "
I said, "Mr. Day?"
I said, "You believe you're here, don't you?"
"Yeah, I believe I'm here. "
I said, "Do you believe any man on earth made you?"
"No, I didn't make me. "
I said, "Do you believe any man on earth made Adam and Eve?"
He said, "No, I don't believe it. "
I said, "What made them?
How come I'm here?"
He said, "That just happened. "
I said, "You saying 'just happened,' let's call that God. "
Let's give it another name.
And say, "That just happened. "
That's what God is: just happened.
Whenever I got through work... had a vacation coming in... the boss man give me a bonus.
I come in home, and we left that evening and started out.
We drove all night and all day.
We didn't stop-
1,413 mlLes out there.
White Sands Missile Base, out there.
That's where the first atomic bomb was ever dropped.
There are sand dunes in there.
And that sand, it crawls.
It crawls over the roads.
They're sweeping it all the time to keep it from covering up the roads.
It's growing sand.
That sand grows.
That desert runs out an average of 14 feet a year.
They've got graders.
They keep grading it off the road.
There's graders out there all the time grading that sand off the road.
Pushing that sand back off of those roads, where you get in there.
Build new roads every day.
Wind come in over that dry sand.
It wraps up so deep by sand overnight.
I reckon, it runs as high as a telephone pole.
Paid and went in there... and got where the white sand's at.
We got us some white sand.
I got a jar here where it grows in it.
See now, I had just a little bit of this in this jar whenever I brought it out.
And now, you see, my jar is nearly full.
It grows. It crawls.
It crawls up the side of the jar, you see?
I reckon it's gonna fill up this jar.
In two more years, itwill fill up this jar.
They say it grows 14 feet a year... out where the town that Billy the Kid got Killed.
They say itwill cover that town in a year to come.
This century, less than 100 years...
- that desertwill eat it up.
- Itwill cover that town.
WILI you look at that tree?
There's 1, 2, 3, 4...
Thirty-fifth one flew.
Thirty-five on one cypress stump.
Listen to that sound.
Hear that sound?
Getting in and out of trees?
That flop-flop sound?
That soundwill sure mistake you for turkeys.
Listen.
Hear that flop-flop. Limbs breaking.
Hear that good flop, then?
Listening to that gives me the turkey fever.
I wish there were as many turkeys as there are buzzards.
[John F. Kennedy]
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon...
We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.
We set sail on this new sea... because there is new knowledge to be gained... and new rights to be won, and they must be won and used... for the progress of all mankind.
We shall send to the moon,
240,000 miles away... from the control station in Houston, a giant rocket... more than 300 feet tall, made of new metal alloys, some of which have not yet been invented, capable of standing heat and stresses... several times more than have ever been experienced, fitted together with a precision better than the finest watch, carrying all the equipment needed for propulsion, guidance, control, communications, food and survival, on an untried mission... to an unknown celestial body.
And, therefore, as we set sail, we ask God's blessing on the most hazardous... and dangerous and greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked.
Thank you.
[Alan L. Bean] Just like a person waiting in the wings to go on stage, they probably have less time to daydream... because they're trying to remember what they've gotta do.
You know, I had the feeling I really ought to concentrate on remembering... the things that I had to do at the moon and all that.
[Charles M. Duke, Jr.] Gosh, here we are, and we're gettir down close.
I hope the suit checks out okay.
You get sweaty palms... and heart starts pounding.
It's like the big game about to start.
[Richard F. Gordon, Jr.] You're in your work clothes, ready to go to work.
But you still have to stay there.
You have to schedule it in conjunction with the booster schedule itself.
You're plugged into a console that's supplying 100% oxygen.
There's kind of a catch-up time... if there's a problem with the booster or something, we're there at the pad until the count gets to a certain point, and then we're called to proceed to the spacecraft.
[Woman]
Y'all take care, now.
Godspeed, men.
[T. Kenneth Mattingly, II]
At the last minute, there was a psychological block there... that said,
"Don't count on this so heavily.
It might not happen."
This is such a big thing. I frankly don't see how you can do it.
Even when participating in it, I think it's audacious that you would try.
I clearly could never understand, as a crewman, how to make it work.
I could only learn how to operate my share of it.
Beir command pilot, I was sittir in the center seat, so that meant
I climbed in last.
I just stood around and waited till they strapped in.
And here was kind of a strange quiet.
You can look out and you can see a large part of the state... and the ocean and this thing out here.
You have the feeling that it's alive.
That's the kind of thing that sort of, for the first time, begins to bring home the fact... that today is not the game we've been playing in training for years.
This is reality.
I had the only window at this point, and I looked out, and doggone if the moon wasrt visible in the daylight... right straight out the top of the window.
I know they're doir their job, because the moors right ahead... and that's where we're pointed.
They're just gonna launch us right straight to this thing.
[Public Affairs Officer]
This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control.
All still go on the Apollo mission... the flight to land the first men on the moon.
The spacecraft also now is on full internal power.
Up to this time, it had been sharing the load with an external power source.
Once we get down to the three minute and ten second mark in the countdown, we'll go on an automatic sequence.
All aspects from there on down will be automatic, run by the ground master computer here in the firing room.
We have some 7.6 million pounds of thrust pushing the vehicle upward, a vehicle that weighs close to six and a half million pounds.
[Mattingly] We all are in this together as a team effort.
We're gonna make it work.
And I don't know how to make it work.
I don't know how to do most of this mission.
But I do know that I can assure you that my piece of it is gonna work, and it won't fail because of me.
[PAO] The members of the launch team here in the control center... are monitoring a number of what we call red line values.
These are tolerances we don't want to go above or below... in temperatures and pressures.
They are standing by to call out any deviations from our plans.
The supervisor has informed launch vehicle testing you are go for launch.
Three minutes, 25 seconds and counting.
We are still go at this time.
[Mattingly]
There's a long period of time... when you've done all the things you can, and there are few things left to say.
You don't know any new jokes to tell.
There's just not much left to say except just sit there and wait.
[Air To Ground/ Mission Control]
And it feels good.
[PAO] Astronauts report it feels good.
One minute, 25 seconds and counting.
Our status board indicates the third stage completely pressurized.
Guidance system goes on internal at 17 seconds, leading up to the ignition sequence at 8.9 seconds.
Power transfer is complete.
Firing command coming in now.
We are on the automatic sequence.
T minus 60 seconds and counting.
We're on internal power with the launch vehicle at this time.
All the second stage tanks now pressurizing.
Thirty-five seconds and counting.
[Mattingly]
It won't fail because of me.
[PAO]
T minus 20 seconds and counting.
Guidance internal.
10, 9, engines on, five, four, three, in two, launch commit.
[Air To Ground/ Lunar Module Pilot]
Yahoo!
[Mattingly]
It feels just like it sounds.
[AG/MC] I got a pitch and a roll program and this baby is really goir.
Roger that.
Stand by for mode one bravo.
Mark one bravo.
That's a lovely liftoff.
That's not bad at all.
[James R. Irwin] There's a moment there just of supreme elation, a complete release of tensions.
To feel all that power precisely directed, to know that we're on course, first of all for Earth orbit, and then precisely inserted onto the right orbit, the right trajectory, for rendezvous with the moon.
[AG/Capcom] Apollo, Houston. You're right smack dab on the trajectory.
Your I.U.'s doir a beautiful job.
[AG/MC]
I got a yaw program.
[AG/CC]
Trajectory's good. Thrust is good.
[AG/MC]
We're on our way, Houston.
[Irwin] At last, I'm leaving the earth, and I'm destined for the moon.
[AG/LMP]
What a ride. What a ride.
[AG/CC]
Roger. We copy, Pete.
[AG/MC]
Roger. Looks good up here too.
Roll's complete.
[AG/LMP] This is really a rockir rollir ride.
[Stuart A. Roosa]
You can feel it shake.
There's a real strong vibration.
Of course, you're up at the end of this beauty.
Here you are, going along with the G on ya.
It's up to about four Gs, but you're psyched up, good shape and all that.
Even liftir your arm to move switches... no problem.
[AG/CC]
Apollo, you are go for staging.
[Roosa]
Here you are comir up on staging, and when staging happens, it's, like, man!
[AG/MC]
We got skirt step.
And that's for ignition,
Houston.
- [AG/CC] Thrust is go.
- [AG/MC] Roger.
[AG/CC] Trajectory, guidance,
C.M.C. Are all go.
[AG/MC]
Thank you, Joe.
[AG/CC] Houston, you're lookir good here, right down the center line.
[PAO] That was shutdown right on the money.
17 Houston, you are go for orbit.
[PAO]
And we're out over the Canaries.
[AG/CC] Apollo, Houston through the Canaries. How do you read?
[AG/MC] Loud and clear, Houston.
Over the Canaries.
[AG/MC] Boy, it's just beautiful up here lookir out the window.
It's just really fantastic.
[AG/CC]
Roger.
[AG/MC] Let me tell ya a little bit about the ride.
[AG/CC]
Uh, John, this is Houston.
If there's nothir startling to report about the ride, we'd rather hold off.
[AG/MC] No, there's nothing really different to report on the ride.
We'll hold off on that.
[AG/MC] The sunset is just as beautiful as always in this business.
[Mattingly] In Africa, there are a lot of nomads out in the desert.
Clear desert nights, you see the fires from all of these... these little yellow dots that represent the fires... from all these nomads camping out.
And you realize the broad area you're looking at.
And each of those little dots represented people... other humans that are out there in an environment...
I would consider more strange than they might think about... me.
[Duke]
When you get there into orbit, the engines shut down and things sorta feel sorta funny.
And you sorta unbuckle your seat belt... and wiggle around in your seat or tap your toes... and all of a sudden you're just bodies everywhere in the room... and you're just doir flips and can'twheels and spins.
[Eugene A. Cernan]
Your first feelings of weightlessness as it hits you... is like going down a country road about 60 miles an hour,
And then you get over the bump, and you get that good sensation feeling... and then, boom, you're back down again.
Only when you're in space and you go into weightlessness, you go over that bump and you never come down.
[AG/CC] Uh, 12 Houston, your program alarm was an integration problem.
Can you give us a verb 96 to stop your integration... and we'd like you to do an E mod dump.
Give us a 3-2-1 mark when you do your verb 74, and if we get it done now, we should have an answer for ya on your erasable memory... by the time you get to Guaymas.
Do a verb 96 first.
[Mattingly]
We had a great deal of difficulty... paying attention to what our job was.
Already I was getting the impression... that this is such an amazing thing that I'm gonna forget these things.
I know I'm going to lose this image.
It's going to be replaced with another.
Each image came up, was there for a flash to be appreciated and savored... and then let go because you know it's gonna be superposed with others.
[AG/LMP] And, Houston, we're beginning to see a beautiful sunrise here.
[AG/CC] Okay. We're giving you a go for your E.V.A. At this time.
[AG/LMP] Okay.
The hatch is open. No sweat.
Ah, it stayed just where I wanted it.
Dave, come on out wherever you are.
[Russell L. Schweickart] When you're outside in one of those spacesuits, you're really in space.
There are no boundaries to what you're seeing.
It's like having a goldfish bowl over your head... which gives you unlimited visibility.
And then the portable life support system is just very, very quiet.
You know, there's a water pump in it that's circulating water... through your underwear... you know, cooling water.
And there's a fan that's pumping the oxygen through, but they're very quiet.
You can't hear them at all.
It's as if you're out there without anything on.
[AG/LMP]
Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Houston.
[Schweickart] There's a total complete silence and that beautiful view... and the realization, of course, that you're going 25,000 miles an hour.
You recognize that you're not there because you deserve to be there.
You were just lucky.
You're the representative of humanity at that point in history... having that experience, in a sense, for the rest of mankind.
[AG/CC]
The flight director says get back in.
[PAO] Apollo Control Houston. Two hours, 25 minutes ground elapsed time.
It will be during this pass that we will have the translunar injection burn.
[Dean Krantz]
Capcom, we're go for T.L.I.
Roger. Guys, I've got the word you wanted to hear.
You are go for T.L.I.
You're go for the moon.
[Mattingly] If there's anything to be remorseful about on going to the moon, it was you didn't get to spend as much time around the earth as you'd like... because there's an awful lot of very interesting things to see.
[AG/MC]
Three, two, one, ignition.
[AG/CC] We confirm ignition, and the thrust is go.
You guys are really haulir the mail out of there.
[AG/MC] Boy, you'd better believe it.
It's like we're climbing straight up.
It's a fantastic sight.
Just like we were shot straight up.
[AG/CC] Uh, you're goir about 6,000 feet a second.
[PAO] Their present altitude is now about 3,000 miles, and the spacecraft moving at nearly 35,000 feet per second.
These three crew members... are traveling faster than any man has ever flown before.
[James Lovell, Jr.] There's not much sensation of what's really happening... except we're looking at the computer and the computer is adding up the velocity, and suddenly we really knew that we were really traveling.
And shoot, when that engine lit off, it was on for a long time.
[AG/MC]
Shutdown.
[Lovell]
But it really hit us when it stopped, and we turned around and looked at the earth.
Suddenly, the earth had started to shrink.
[AG/CMP] Hello, Houston. You'd have to see this planet to believe it.
[AG/LMP] This is just so you guys don't get too excited... and forget what your job is down there.
[AG/CC] We're ready for what we're about to receive.
[Frank Sinatra On Tape]
# Fly me to the moon #
# Let me play among the stars #
# Let me see what spring is like #
# On Jupiter and Mars #
# In other words #
# Please be true #
# In other words #
# I love you ## which you could listen to music.
We were allowed to carry a personal cassette so you could play the music.
Mine was country music.
[Man On Tape] Hi, this is Buck Owens from the Buckaroos.
We came down to the studio and thought we'd put together a little thing... that you could take along with you on your trip.
Now when you get back, they're probably gonna put you in the movies, so the first thing we're gonna do for ya... is to play a little song called "Act Naturally."
It goes like this:
# They're gonna put me in the movies #
# They're gonna make a big star out of me #
# Well, we'll make a scene about a man that's sad and lonely #
# And all I gotta do is act naturally #
# Well, I'll bet you
I'm a-gonna be a big star #
# You might win an Oscar
You can never tell #
# The movies are gonna make me a big star #
# 'Cause I can play the part so well #
# Well, I hope you'll come to see me in the movie #
# And I know that you're gonna plainly see #
# Mmm, the biggest fool that's ever hit the big time #
# And all I gotta do is act naturally #
By the way, you know we're makir this tape, and they're goir to the moon.
They're on their way to the moon right now. Oh.
[AG/CC] Hey, anybody up there read me? This is Houston.
[Roosa] You don't think of it as Texas or the United States.
You really think of it as Earth.
The three things that
I associated with Earth... were people and green trees and fresh water.
[Man On Tape] This is different for me. My name is Merle Haggard, and this is my band, the Strangers.
I hope we will be able to do somethir you'll enjoy on your way to the moon.
And of course, we hope that you come back, but we want you to leave this tape there, okay?
We want this tape to be out of sight.
# Someday when our dream world finds us #
# And these hard times are gone #
# We'll laugh and count our blessings #
# In a mansion all our own #
# If we both pull together #
# Tomorrow's sure to come #
# Someday we'll look back #
# And say #
# It was fun #
[Roosa]
When you get ready to eat, they'll say right on there, "Command
Module Pilot, day three, meal two."
So you take that packet out, and you may have two drinks... and three or four different types of food in there.
So you've gotta find a spot to stick these, or they're gonna float off.
And then you've gotta get the water gun.
You gotta mix up the drinks and mix up the food... and knead 'em around... and not let everything float off in the interim.
# And someday #
# We'll look back and say #
# It was fun #
# Someday #
# When our dream world finds us #
[Duke] The only bad part about zero gravity in Apollo... was goir to the bathroom.
We had a very crude system.
For your feces, it was a bag, and you'd put this bag in the right position.
So you go, but nothir goes to the bottom of the bag in zero gravity.
Everything floats. So you've got this bag and then the problem... is gettir it off and closir up the bag, makir sure everything's still in the bag.
# Someday #
# We'll look back and say #
# We had a good time on the way to the moon, didn't we ##
[AG/Command Module Pilot]
Are you still planning to have
TV at the scheduled time?
[AG/CC] Right. You can go ahead with the TV now. We're standing by.
[AG/LMP] Hello, Houston. We've got a beautiful view of the earth here... that is absolutely fantastic.
[PAO] We're standing by at this time to receive... the first TV transmission from the spacecraft.
[AG/CMP] Houston, we're now showing you a view of the earth... through the telephoto lens.
This transmission is coming to you... approximately halfway between the moon and the earth.
[AG/LMP] It makes you realize just what you have back there on Earth.
The earth from here is a grand oasis in the big vastness of space.
[AG/MC] I keep imagining, if I'm some lonely traveler from another planet, would I land on the blue or the brown part of the earth?
[AG/CMP] Okay, world.
Hold on to your hat.
I'm gonna turn ya upside down.
[PAO] The spacecraft at the present time... is in a slow roll as part of the passive thermal control program... to maintain temperatures.
[Cernan] You have to, literally, just pinch yourself... and ask yourself the question, silently,
"Do you really know where you are at this point in time and space... and in reality and in existence?"
When you look out the window and you're lookir back... at the most beautiful star in the heavens... the most beautiful because it's the one we understand, and we know it... it's home, humanity, people, family, love, life.
And besides that, it is beautiful.
We can see from pole to pole and across oceans and continents, and you can watch it turn and there's not strings holding it up.
And it's movir in a blackness that is almost beyond conception.
[AG/CC]
Rog, how's that tape recorder?
Is the R.P.M. Up to nominal?
[AG/CMP] Yeah. It works pretty good here in zero G.
It works better than it does down there on the ground.
We're ready for the news now.
[AG/CC]
Okay. Let's see.
The Beatles have announced they will no longer perform as a group.
The quartet is reported to have made in excess of a half billion dollars... during their short musical career.
Rumors they will use this money to start their own space program are false.
That's about it for news. A recap of how the top ten teams did yesterday:
Ohio State beat Purdue,
42 to 14,
Texas beat T.C.U.,
69 to 7.
Tennessee lost to Mississippi.
Final score on that one was 38 to nothing.
Notre Dame won over Georgia Tech last night, 38 to 20.
And, of course, Purdue lost to Ohio State.
[Cernan] When the sunlight shines through the blackness of space, it's black, but I was in sunlight, and I was able to look at this blackness.
I mean, what are you looking at?
Call it the universe, but it's the infinity of space and time.
I'm looking at something called space, that had no end, and at time, that has no meaning.
You can really focus on it... because you got this planet out there... this star called Earth... which itself is in this blackness, but it is lit up... because the sunlight strikes on an object... strikes on something called Earth.
And it's not a hostile blackness.
Maybe it's not hostile because the beauty of the earth... that sort of gives it life.
[Mattingly]
Throughout the flight, the times when one could sit back... and really appreciate what an amazing adventure this was... was only during those little periods of time... when you had a chance to stop and do the things you werert programmed to do.
A lot of times, when there was nothing else to do... or after everybody'd gone to sleep and I couldn't,
I'd open up the window and look around.
One thing every spacecraft ought to have is a huge window.
Looking back at the earth was a pastime that I never really got tired of.
[AG/CC]
Uh, who've we got up now?
[AG/MC]
The other two guys are pretty sleepy.
They sacked out again, so
I'm holdir the fort down for a while.
[PAO]
Biomedical data recently was monitored, and the C.M.P. Was soundly asleep... while the commander was resting... but perhaps not soundly asleep.
[AG/CC] We got the black watch watchir you tonight.
[AG/MC]
You picked the midnight shift, I see.
[AG/CC] Yeah, it's turnir out to be kind of quiet too.
[AG/MC]
We like it that way.
[Bean] When you're out there in this little command module, you see the risk you're taking because you realize... that, if the glass breaks or the computers quit workir... or the electrical system quits workir, you're not gonna get back.
And you have time to contemplate this.
You have time to think about it.
And you have time to run it through your mind a lot of different times.
[AG/MC] How far away from Earth now,
Jim... about?
[AG/MC] It looks like you're approaching 150,000 miles.
[AG/CC] Frank, we had a little egg nog over at Charlie Duke's tonight.
Val Anders dropped by. She's lookir fine. Tell Bill she's doir real well.
[AG/MC]
Rog, thank you.
[John L. Swigert, Jr.]
Everything that I know... my family and my possessions, my friends, my country.
It's all down there on that little thing, and it's so insignificant in this great big vastness of space.
[PAO] Here in Mission Control, the coffee cup... has become an appliance... second only to the headset... in usefulness here.
[PAO] Let's, uh, cycle through some of our consumables... and other items this morning, and I'll tell you what we see.
And all this looks quite nominal.
[AG/CC]
Lights, camera, action.
We'll show you some of the type meals that we have on Earth.
Matter of fact, on this flight, we've carried along pieces of bread.
And along with the bread... we have a ham spread.
And I'll show you, I hope, how easy it is... to spread some ham... in the environment of zero G.
I think we've discovered that it is quite easy to...
[AG/CC] That's great.
You all ought to set this to music.
Oh, you want music?
## [Theme From 2001]
This little tape recorder has been a big benefit to us... in passing for the time away in our transit onto the moon.
And it's rather odd to see it floating like this, in odyssey, while it's playing... the theme from 2001.
- [AG/CC] We've lost our picture.
- What the...
[AG/MC] Okay, Houston.
We've had a problem here.
I got three fuel cell lights, an A.C. Buss light, fuel cell disconnect, A.C. Buss overload one and two, main buss A and B, out.
[AG/CC]
This is Houston. Say again, please.
[AG/MC]
Gang, I don't know what happened here.
We had everything in the world drop out.
[AG/MC]
We are venting something.
[AG/CMP] I don't think this is gonna be a simple problem.
[PAO]
We have an apparent serious problem... with a leak in the cryogenic oxygen in the service module... which provides breathing oxygen for the crew.
[AG/CC] Apollo, Houston.
Try S.C.E. To auxiliary, over.
[AG/CMP]
N.C.E. To auxiliary.
[AG/CC]
S.C.E. S.C. E to auxiliary.
[Krantz] Okay. Let's make sure we don't do anything... that's going to blow our C.S.M.
Electrical power with the batteries... or that will cause us to lose fuel cell number two.
[AG/CC] On panel 276 under instrumentation and power control, open C.B. Number three and number four.
Close ascent feed one and two circuit breakers.
Cycle the Parker valves, and then open the S.M.C. Circuit breakers on panel 11.
[AG/CMP]
Hey, it's off. It's off.
[AG/CC]
That sounds beautiful, troops.
That's exactly what we wanted to see.
[AG/CMP] Charlie, my hats off to the guys in the trench.
I love 'em.
[AG/CC] And, by the way, welcome to the moors sphere.
You're in the influx.
[Bean] One of the things different about a lunar trip... is you don't pass anyplace on the way.
Going to the moon, you leave the launchpad, then you leave Earth orbit.
And then a couple of days later, after passing nothing, all of a sudden, you're at the moon.
And that lack of way points, to me, had an effect of making it seem a little magical and mystical getting there.
[AG/CMP]
This is really a rugged planet.
[PAO] We're drawing close to the moon with the Apollo spacecraft.
Our L.O.S. Clock, our loss of signal clock, continues to count down until that time... that the spacecraft will pass out of communications range... over the backside of the moon.
On approach, the spacecraft just sort of dives towards... and behind the moon.
[Michael Collins]
It was a totally different moon than any moon I had ever seen before.
It was in this eery shadow.
No motion. Utterly silent.
It sort of gave one a feeling of foreboding.
It didn't seem like a very friendly or welcoming place.
[AG/CC] Apollo, this is Houston.
You are go for L.O.I.
[AG/MC]
Go ahead, Houston.
[AG/CC] Jim, you are go for the burn.
Go for the burn.
[AG/MC]
Okay. Apollo is go.
[Roosa] You're going too fast to orbit the moon. You're rockir on ready.
[AG/CMP] Okay. Two minutes, babe.
Give it a final trim.
Burn time is 15 seconds, so it's gonna go in a hurry.
[Roosa] You're in the burn position.
You're ready to go.
[AG/CMP]
Baby, let's make this one.
- [Roosa] Then there it is.
- [AG/CMP] Thirty-five seconds.
[Roosa]
It's 2001 type stuff.
That old moors just growir magnificently fast, and it's just fillir up that hatch window... and you're driftir into the shadow.
[AG/CMP]
Okay, baby. Eight, seven, six, five, three, two, one.
Burn. Burn.
[AG/CC] You're burnir.
Okay. Seventy-eight to go,
50 to go, 20 to go.
- Standby, Tom.
- [AG/CMP] Shut down.
[AG/LMP]
Oh, beautiful, beautiful.
[AG/MC] Apollo, Houston. You got the burn off. We're in good shape.
[AG/MC] Boy, I tell you.
We is down among them.
We is going backwards.
You know that?
[Roosa] You've worked so long and so hard, and finally you're here.
The burn has gone well.
You know you're in lunar orbit.
You know the orbit is good.
You're right where you wanted to be.
And it just looked like you could reach out and touch it.
[PAO] Apollo now traveling over the backside of the moon.
The crew should be seeing the features, the rugged features, moving below them at a high rate of speed.
[AG/CMP] Charlie, we just saw Earth rise and it's gotta be magnificent.
Charlie, it might sound corny, but the view is really out-of-this-world.
[AG/MC] Dave, you ought to start gettir your hatch closed.
[AG/CMP] Say again.
[AG/MC] Start gettir your hatch closed if you're not already doir it.
[Gordon]
I was disappointed.
I wanted to go with them so bad
I could taste it.
As far as I was concerned, that's what it was all about... not only goir to the moon, but goir down to the surface and walking.
[PAO] We're now less than two minutes away from the separation burn, which will be performed by the command module.
When we next hear from them, the lunar module... should be undocked from the command and service module.
[AG/CMP] You'll never know how big this thing gets... when there ain't nobody but one guy.
[AG/LMP] Yeah. Don't get lonesome out there, John.
[Gordon]
I wish I could go down there with 'em.
You may not talk about it much, but part of your training is comir back by yourself.
[AG/CMP]
See you later.
[Gordon] I wish the damn thing would hold three people.
[PAO] It's grown quiet here in Mission Control.
A few moments ago,
Flight Director Gene Krantz... requested that everyone sit down, get prepared for events that are coming, and he closed with,
"Good luck to all of you."
[AG/MC] We's go and we's down among 'em, Charlie!
[AG/CC] Rog, I hear ya weavir your way up the freeway.
[AG/MC] You're goir right down U.S. 1, Mike.
[AG/CC]
Rog, copy. Looks great.
[Krantz] Okay, all flight controllers, go, no go for landing. Retro.
- Go.
- Econ.
- Go.
- Surgeon.
- Go.
- Fido.
- Go.
- Guidance.
- Go.
- Telcom.
- Go.
- G.N.C.
- Go.
- We're go for landing.
[AG/CC] Eagle, Houston.
You are go for landing, over.
[AG/MC] Okay, Houston.
We'll give you a countdown.
Four, three, two, one. Fire.
[AG/LMP]
Pitch over. There it is. Oh, baby.
[AG/MC] We are sure comir down to that drop. Look at that rille.
That's gotta be, gotta be probably Diamondback right there.
[Pete Conrad] When the pitch is over and you get your first look, you know... there's nothir but nine million craters out there.
A terrible sinking feeling.
I obviously didn't recognize a thing after studying all these photographs.
Nothir looked right.
- [Krantz] How you doir, control?
- We look good here. Fine.
- How about you, Telcom?
- Go.
- Guidance, you happy? Fido?
- Go. Go.
[AG/CC] You are go.
You're go to continue power descent.
You are go to continue power descent. Over.
[Irwin] All during this power descent
I kept telling myself,
"This is not for real. You're back in the simulator. Just remember that."
[AG/CC] Eagle, Houston.
It's descent two fuel to monitor, over.
Eagle, Houston.
Everything's lookir good here, over.
[AG/MC] Houston, I'm getting a little fluctuation in the A.C. Voltage now.
[AG/CC]
Roger. Stand by.
[AG/CC] Lookir good to us.
You're still lookir good.
[AG/MC] Houston, you're lookir at our delta eight.
[AG/CC]
That's affirmative.
Lookir good to us, over.
[AG/CC] Eagle, Houston.
We'll monitor your delta eight.
[AG/CC] Six plus two-five throttle down. Six plus two-five throttle down.
[AG/MC]
Roger. Copy. Six plus two-five.
[AG/MC] Let me try auto again now... see what happens.
[AG/CC]
We got data dropout. Roger. Stand by.
[Krantz] We're go on that alarm?
If it doesn't reoccur, we'll be go.
[AG/CC]
We are go on that alarm.
[AG/MC]
Roger. I understand. Go for landing.
[AG/CC]
Roger. We got good data.
[AG/LMP]
Altitude velocity lights.
[AG/CC] Eagle, we got you now.
It's lookir good, over.
[AG/LMP] Four forward, driftir to the right a little.
Comir at us 23, 21 down, 33 degrees.
[AG/CC]
We're go. Same type. We're go.
- [AG/LMP] Kickir up dust.
- [AG/MC] A couple of big boulders.
[AG/LMP]
Comir right. Got a good spot.
[AG/MC]
Not too bad. Here comes the shadow.
[AG/LMP]
Oh, are we comir in.
- [AG/MC] Stand by for touchdown.
- [AG/LMP] Stand by.
[AG/LMP]
Bam!
[AG/MC]
Houston, uh, Tranquility Base here.
The eagle has landed.
[PAO]
There's a cheer in this room.
What we're witnessing now is mars very first trip into space... with a station stop along the route.
[AG/MC]
We gonna stay, Houston?
[AG/CC]
Eagle, you are stay for T-1.
[Bean]
This thing came to a stop on the moon.
It was kind of a letdown saying,
"You know, we're gonna have to get it going fast again to get back home."
[AG/CC] Neil, this is Houston.
What's your status on hatch opening?
[AG/MC]
Okay, Houston. I'm on the porch.
[AG/CC] Neil, this is Houston.
Loud and clear by radio.
Check and verify
TV circuit breaker in.
[AG/MC]
Roger. TV circuit breakers in.
[AG/CC] Houston, roger. We copy, and we're standing by for your T.E.D.
[AG/MC]
I'm gonna pull it now.
Houston, the mesa came down all right.
[AG/CC]
And we're gettir a picture on the TV.
[AG/MC]
Got a good picture, huh?
[AG/CC] Okay, Neil. We can see you coming down the ladder now.
The surface seems to be very, very fine-grained... as you get close to it.
I'm at the foot of the ladder.
Okay. I'm gonna step off the LM now.
That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.
[Conrad] I had a bet with somebody who didn't...
Really felt that Neil spent a great deal of time... before he went figuring out his famous words, and they were not extemporaneous on the spot historical words.
He actually felt that these words... might have even been written for Neil by somebody else.
And I said,
"Well, I'll bet you 500 bucks...
"that when I get to the bottom of the ladder...
"nobody ever remembers what the second person to do something does anyhow...
I'm gonna say,
"It may have been a small step for Neil, but it's a big step for a little fella like me."
[AG/LMP]
Are you ready for me to come out?
[AG/MC] Okay.
I want to back up and partially close the hatch, making sure not to lock it on my way out.
[Conrad] So this person says,
"Ah, no way you're gonna do that.
They're gonna tell you what to say."
I said, "Okay, a bet's a bet."
So I bet this person $500, and when I got to the bottom of the ladder, I said it.
And that may have been a small one for Neil, but that's a long one for me.
[AG/CC] 12 Houston, we have you in blushing black and white.
[AG/LMP]
What happened to the color?
[AG/CC]
Maybe the color wheel will come up.
[AG/LMP]
I can feel the wheels running... because I can feel something in motion inside.
[AG/CC] Why don't you put your glove in front of the lens?
[AG/LMP]
All right. Will do.
- [AG/CC] That's comir in there now.
- Got the ol' camera running.
[AG/CC] Okay.
What change did you make?
[AG/LMP]
I hit it on the top with my hammer.
I figured we didn't have a thing to lose.
I can't believe it.
[AG/MC]
I want you to watch this.
[AG/LMP] I don't know if this'll work or not, Charlie.
Well, in my left hand
I have a feather, in my right hand, a hammer.
And I guess one of the reasons we got here today... was because of a gentleman named Galileo a long time ago... who made a rather significant discovery... about falling objects in gravity fields.
And we thought that where would be a better place... to confirm his findings than on the moon?
And so we thought we'd try it here for ya.
The feather happens to be, appropriately, a falcon feather, for our falcon.
And I'll drop the two of them here, and, hopefully, they'll hit the ground at the same time.
How about that?
That proves that Mr. Galileo was correct in his findings.
[AG/CC] We've got a beautiful picture of you guys up down here.
Let me tell you, Bob. This flag is a beautiful picture.
Hey, John, this is perfect, with the LM, you and the ol' flag.
We really should set the flag up on a hill, Charlie, but there just ain't one.
I know, John.
I'll put it right here. Big rock.
[Duke] I was proud for our country more than I was proud for me.
And it was nothir that I did.
I just happened to have gotten there at the right time.
My background carried me through.
But there were a lot of other qualified people that didn't go.
Why my name came out,
I don't know.
And we very proudly deploy it on the moon... to stay for as long as it can, in honor of all those people who have worked so hard to put us here... and to make the country and mankind something different than it was.
[Duke] It was like sittir in the last row of the balcony, lookir down at that play goir on.
While I was in the play, it was more like I was a spectator.
[AG/CC]
Tranquility, this is Houston.
We'd like to say, from all of us down here in Houston, and, really, from all of us... in all the countries in the entire world, we think that you've done a magnificent job up there today, over.
Thank you very much.
Have you had enough TV for today?
[AG/CC] Yes, indeed. It's been a mighty fine presentation there.
Thank you. Couldrt have enjoyed it as much as we did.
[AG/CC] Get some rest there and have at it tomorrow.
Okay. Signing off.
See you again tomorrow.
[PAO] All systems on the lunar module are in good order.
We have not heard from Tranquility base since saying good night.
[Duke] My mind's one that just goes constantly, so I took a sleepir pill.
Slept like a baby.
I had one dream that was very vivid.
In my dream, we were drivir the Rover up to the north.
And you didn't really feel like you were out there.
It was untouched.
The serenity of it... had a pristine purity about it.
We crossed a hill.
I felt, "Gosh, I've been here before."
And there was a set of tracks out in front of us.
So we asked Houston if we could follow the tracks, and they said yes.
And we turned and followed the tracks.
Within an hour or so we found this vehicle.
It looked just like the Rover.
The two people in it... they looked like me and John... had been there for thousands of years.
It was not a nightmare-type situation... nothir like that.
Probably one of the most real experiences in my life.
[Mattingly] I'd have traded on the drop of a hat... to go and land on the moon.
I'm one of these nuts.
I like classical music, and I almost learned to like country and western.
One of the things I took was Berlioz'
"Symphonie Fantastique," which seemed like that was appropriate to be taking to the moon.
And I was floatir along, just layir back and enjoyir life.
I had just crossed the face of the moon, goir towards the darkness.
And here's this strange scene, this music.
And it just seemed to put it all together in one moment... that you could completely forget that this is a real situation.
[PAO]
This is Apollo control Houston... at 104 hours, 31 minutes now into this historic mission.
The lunar surface temperature in the sun should be around 135 degrees today.
In the shade, the temperature would again be around minus 100... to minus 150 degrees Fahreneit.
That would be in the shadow of the lunar module.
Ah, look at that!
Ah, it's a panoramic scene of beauty!
Al, can you find the earth?
[AG/LMP]
Oh, there it is. I see it.
Lookir at the earth down there, Houston.
It looks like you're littler than a golf ball at arm's length now.
Sure looks pretty, though.
Really looks spectacular.
[Bean]
It seemed very unreal to me... to be there, looking back at the earth, thinking how far, far away it was.
This is the moon.
That is the earth.
I'm really here.
[PAO] We're allowing about five minutes for the drive to station three.
[AG/LMP]
Okay. Safety belts on.
And here we go.
[AG/LMP]
How's the drivir, John? Pretty easy?
[AG/MC] Drivir good.
[AG/LMP] Man, Indie's never seen a driver like this. Barney Oldfield.
[AG/MC] Charlie, what should we be headir for?
- [AG/LMP] Those craters up there.
- [AG/MC] Don't tell me that.
[AG/LMP]
Boy, this is so neat.
You look like you're headed just about for our spot.
- See Survey Ridge down there?
- [AG/MC] Yep.
[AG/LMP]
This is gonna be spectacular!
No, not through this crater.
- Yeow! Whoa!
- Tryir to see if you're nervous.
[AG/LMP]
OI' Barney's really drivir this beauty.
[AG/MC]
Only way to fly, Tony.
[AG/LMP] This is gonna be such a spectacular view, you can't believe it.
[AG/CC]
Well, that's good news.
[AG/LMP]
We're here! You did it!
Hey, that was a good stop.
Those wheels just locked.
Marked off! Super.
[AG/CC]
John, did you dust that TV lens?
[AG/MC]
Get some dirt in your eye, Houston?
[AG/CC]
That does a good job on the lens there.
[AG/LMP] You want us to go up and travel along that ridge?
[AG/CC]
Yeah, why don't you press on up there?
[AG/LMP] I think the best place here for the ALSEP... is to the LM's
[AG/CC] That sounds good, Charlie.
And, John, it's 2-6-6.
[Cernan]
I felt very welcome there.
You know, the moors been waitir for us for thousands of years... millions of years, maybe, unless someone else has already been there before us at some time.
That's possible, although we didn't see any evidence of that.
I felt like I was the only one there, but not an alien... not an alien in terms of invading someone else's domain.
I didn't find the moon hostile.
I found it very majestically beautiful.
Bland in color, but majestically beautiful.
[AG/LMP] There's a look at that glass-covered one right there.
Pretty good size, isn't it?
It looks like it's about three days old.
So it must be on the order of four billion.
So let's fill this one up, and then...
Ah, rats!
Betcha that looked like a comedy of errors on the tube.
Yeah.
Hold still.
That is a crystalline rock if I've ever seen a crystalline rock.
- First one today.
- Yeah.
We gotta get over this ridge, John.
Do you want to take off and go that way now?
Yeah.
John, did you make those little footprints here?
Yeah, I guess I did.
Aah, the old footprints on the crater rim.
There's a good rock right there.
Look at the size of that rock!
I thought this thing was just right next door to us.
Well, Tony, that's your house rock right there.
It's got black streaks coming out of it.
This is tough going here.
Let me have the shovel.
I'll get it. Just a minute.
Good deal, boy.
There you go.
I can't get going here.
[AG/CC] You've got about ten minutes left before we have to leave.
- Is that okay for you?
- Yep, sure is.
[AG/LMP]
338 is the soil sample.
That is the best sample we got.
- I know it.
- I'll tell ya.
[Cernan]
You just had to steal time now and then.
You just had to stop chipping at a rock... and figure out that bringing back some kind of thought and feeling... was as important as bringing another chunk of rock back.
And not being a machine but being a human being, you have to stop and say,
"Do you know where you are and what you're looking at?"
And try and take in, in those few moments of privacy you have, everything there is to take in in that moment.
[AG/CC]
You've got five minutes here.
[Cernan] And all of a sudden, you've got to get to work.
Okay, Houston, as I stand out here... in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley,
I realize there's a fundamental truth to our nature:
Man must explore.
[Cernan] One of the things you gotta stop and do... is make sure to have fun too.
Because you're only probably gonna come this way once.
# I was strolling on the moon one day #
# In the merry, merry month of December #
- No, May.
- May.
# When much to my surprise #
# A pair of funny eyes #
## [Humming]
Boy, is this a neat way to travel.
Isn't it great?
## [Humming]
- I like to skip along.
- Not me, boy. Skip.
Well, whatever you call it.
I can't get my left leg in front of me.
## [Humming]
[Duke]
It was almost dangerous.
You lose sight of the fact that it's a vacuum out there, and if you spring a leak in that suit, you're gonna be dead.
Uh-oh.
Nice soft Navy landing.
Yahoo!
Boy, do I like to run up here.
I feel like Bugs Bunny.
This is neat.
Here come the Bobbsey twins.
You're pretty agile there, twinkle toes.
I'm goir out for the ballet when I get back.
You learn another line of work up here.
[AG/CC] And while you're bouncing around there, you might keep your eye out for a nearby crater.
Ah, rats. I been on my knees twice to get that.
- John.
- Yes, sir?
You are black from the knees down.
No way to avoid it. That's why I'm glad the pressure suit bends.
John, you are filthy.
I'll tell you, that's the pot calling the kettle black.
Hey, here's a rock they'll be glad to see in Houston.
Man, Tony, you don't know how much fun this has been.
[AG/CC]
We concur, John.
[Schmitt]
Having gotten away from the spacecraft,
I was able to really realize... what this place was like that we had landed in.
I had tried to anticipate what it would be like for many years, but it was obvious that there was no way one could have anticipated... what it would be like to stand in the valley of Taurus Litterol, a place deeper than the Grand Canyon and equally as spectacular, and see this brilliantly illuminated landscape... with a brighter sun than anyone had ever stood in before, with a blacker-than-black sky, and then to top the whole scene off, in this blacker-than-black sky... was a beautiful, brilliantly illuminated... blue marble that we call the earth.
The path of evolution is now in space as much as on Earth.
Man has shown that as a species... mankind was willing to commit itself... to living in environments that were completely different... than those in which the species evolved.
We put a shield of life around ourselves... in order to protect the life within, but the willingness to go out there is there.
We've shown that.
The curve of human evolution has been bent.
[AG/CC]
Okay, it's time to load up right now.
[AG/LMP]
We're on our way again, Tony.
[AG/CC] We'd like you to drive gingerly up to the ALSEP area there.
[AG/LMP]
Okay, we'll go on up.
[LG/MC]
You want to go right or left?
We want to head...
Just keep going west.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hook a left.
You gotta expect trouble from backseat drivers.
[AG/CC]
Okay, we copy that, John.
Look at this baby. I'm really getting confidence in it now.
[AG/LMP]
This back wheel's off the ground.
Charlie, whatever you do, don't hit that brake.
[AG/CC]
The Grand Prix drivers are at it again.
This is about the neatest thing I ever saw.
It's back to the LM, right, Tony?
[AG/CC]
You bet your life.
And you're well ahead on the time line.
[AG/MC] We must've forgotten something. That's all I can say.
[AG/LMP]
Well, everything's running.
We're just about to start upslope here.
Have we been climbing, John?
Look at that pitch meter.
It's pegged out high.
Yeah, we have been climbing.
Tony, we've really...
It doesn't feel like we're climbing, but we've been climbing for a while here.
We're going up a steep, steep slope, John. I'll tell you.
[AG/MC]
Look at that, Charlie.
[AG/LMP]
I don't see. What? What?
[AG/MC]
Well, I'll be doggoned.
[AG/LMP]
Look at that!
[AG/MC] You said you were gonna see some other tracks on the moon.
[AG/LMP]
I knew it.
We're going back down our tracks, Tony.
[AG/CC]
Okay, good show.
[AG/LMP]
There she is, John.
[AG/MC]
Somebody up there likes us.
[AG/LMP]
Don't run into our home.
[Irwin] I felt like I was an alien as I travelled through space.
But when I got on the moon,
I didn't feel that at all.
I felt at home there, even though the earth was a long ways away.
We could see it directly above, about the size of a marble... and realize that we were there but by the grace of God.
I felt like I was at the end of a thin cord... that could be cut at any time.
It was precarious, but yet I felt comfortable.
I felt something other than what we can visually sense.
A spiritual presence was there.
Perhaps it was because so many people on the earth were focusing their attention.
They were maybe sending signals to us somehow.
I sensed,
I guess in a way, much like maybe the first man on the earth would have sensed... like Adam or perhaps Eve... as they were standing on the earth and they realized they were all alone.
There was no one else on the earth, but yet they had that special communication.
And I guess it was similar to the feeling I had... when I realized that Dave Scott and I... were the only two on this vast planet.
Another world.
We were the only two there.
We felt an unseen love.
We were not alone.
Hi, big guy.
[AG/CC]
Hi there, Charlie.
Bob, this is Gene, and I'm on the surface.
And as I take mars last step from the surface, in everlasting commemoration... of what the real meaning of Apollo is to the world, we'd like to uncover a plaque... that has been on the leg of our spacecraft... that we have climbed down many times over the last three days.
The words are...
"Here man completed his first exploration of the moon.
"May the spirit of peace in which we came...
"be reflected in the lives... of all mankind."
[PAO] Some 7 minutes,
22 seconds away from ignition... on the LM ascent back into lunar orbit.
- Capcom.
- Go.
- Surgeon.
- Go.
- G and C.
- Go.
- Fido.
- Go.
AFD. Oh, we don't have an AFD. FAO?
Network. Recovery.
Capcom, we're go for liftoff.
[AG/CC] Tranquility Base, Houston.
You're cleared for takeoff.
[AG/MC] Roger. Understand.
We're number one on the runway.
[Irwin]
The moon is different.
It's become mars first outpost, our first footstep in space.
Where man was able to look back at the earth and see the earth, and see himself in a different perspective.
[AG/MC]
Six, five, four, three, two, one, ignition.
[Cernan] As you leave, you're leaving this unbelievably beautiful... naked charcoal ball out there in space.
And you've been around the moon.
You've been on it.
You're seeing something that's familiar to you.
That's home.
That's where we lived.
There's where we left the lunar rover.
There's the mountains and the valleys.
It has, in a sense, been a home, a life-sustaining home for you.
And when you leave it and you see those things, you leave it with the same kind of feeling and awe... that you left the earth with several days earlier.
[Bean] When we were about 30 minutes from rendezvous with the module,
Pete said to me,
"You want to fly this thing?"
And I said,
"Well, yeah, I'd like to fly."
As I took the controls,
I said, "Wait a minute.
The people on Earth in Mission
Control aren't gonna like this."
And to show how he thinks about things, he said,
"Don't worry. We're on the back side of the moon. They'll never know."
[AG/CC]
Houston. You're looking good.
[AG/MC] Roger, Houston.
We are returning to the earth. Over.
[AG/CC] Glad to have you on the way back home.
[AG/MC]
I think I must have the feeling... that the travellers on the old sailing ships used to have.
You've gone on a very long voyage away from home, and now we're headed back.
I have that feeling of being proud of the trip... but still happy to be going back home and back to our home port.
[John F. Kennedy]
We set sail on this new sea... because there is new knowledge to be gained... and new rights to be won, and they must be won and used for the progress of all mankind.
[Cernan]
As time goes on, I truly believe that you are able to pull out of the subconscious... a great many things that you absorbed... in those moments while you were there looking back at the earth.
And I can almost transform my body, certainly my mind, through time and space instantaneously to that spot on the moon.
I know where I am when I look at the moon.
It's not just some abstract, romantic idea.
It's something very real to me.
The stars are my home.
In October, my brother and I left Ohio.
We were driving to California.
We got into Dallas on a Thursday night.
Friday morning, while I'm eating eggs and drinking coffee, I get a good job.
I mean, it's, you know... all these people are supposedly out of work.
I'm not in town a half a day, and I've got a job.
Everything clicked.
It's as if I was meant to be here.
I'd run away from home a couple of times. Once or twice. I don't know.
And this all started,
David is running away from home.
And he takes... I took a pistol of my dad's and a shotgun.
Took a neighbor's car.
I had broken into their house and got the keys to it.
I forget exactly what it was.
Ended up coming to Dallas.
I went to work and no one showed up.
Being a weekend, sometimes they worked, sometimes they didn't.
On the way home, I ran out of gas.
And as I was walking down the street with the gas can... a person, at that time, pulled over.
I guess since I had the gas can... he figured I was out of gas.
I wasn't 100 yards from the car.
And being Thanksgiving weekend, there was no gas stations open.
He stopped and asked me if I needed any help.
I'm driving down some street somewhere in Dallas.
I had just turned 16.
And there was a guy over there,
I think he'd run out of gas...
I took him to get some gas.
This was Randall Adams.
Ended up following him where him and his brother were staying.
Eventually, that evening... we went out and got some beer.
We smoked a little marijuana and what have you.
Went to a movie that night.
I get up, I go to work on Saturday.
Why did I meet this kid? I don't know.
Why did I run out of gas at that time?
I don't know. But it happened.
The day they picked me up, December 21.
They took me upstairs.
What floor, I don't know.
But they put me in a little room.
Gus Rose walked in.
He had a confession there he wanted me to sign.
He said that I would sign.
He didn't give a damn what I said.
I would sign this piece of paper.
I told him I couldn't.
"I don't know what the hell you people expect of me.
"But there's no way I can sign that."
He left. He came back in 10 minutes.
And threw a pistol on the table.
Asked me to look at it.
Which I did. I looked.
He asked me to pick it up.
I told him no, I wouldn't do that.
He threatened me.
Again, I told him no.
He pulled his service revolver on me.
We looked at each other for...
To me, it seemed hours.
I do not like looking down the barrel of a pistol.
I do not like being threatened.
When he finally saw that he would either have to kill me... or forget the signature...
I guess he forgot the signature, because he put his pistol up.
He took the pistol on the table, put it up and stormed out.
I had a casual, friendly conversation with him to start with... to try to size him up... to see what he liked and what he didn't like.
I found almost immediately that he didn't have much conscience.
Anything he had done, it never really bothered him.
He had done other things that he told me about... that didn't seem to bother him in the least.
He showed no expression whatsoever.
It's just like he's sitting here talking about the color of this wall... or the shooting of the police officer.
He showed no reaction to any of the questions.
He almost overacted his innocence.
He protested he hadn't done anything.
Couldn't imagine why we were bringing him in.
He didn't fight or he didn't resist.
He just protested his innocence.
I told them what happened that
Saturday, that I had met this kid.
I kept telling them the same thing.
They didn't want to believe me.
Never once was I allowed a phone call.
Never once was an attorney there.
I don't know how long this had been.
I had smoked two packs of cigarettes and had been out for a long time.
Wood didn't take his ticket book out of the car.
He left it in the car on the front seat... which indicates that he was not going to write a ticket.
What he was probably going to do was have them turn on the headlights.
He didn't know that the car was stolen.
I think that there's a very good chance... that he was going to check the driver's license... and tell him to turn on his headlights, and let the guy be on his way.
Officer Wood's wife had purchased him... a bulletproof vest and had it under the Christmas tree.
Or had it stored away, to give to him at Christmastime.
His partner was one of the first female police officers... that was assigned to patrol.
They were from the Northwest Station.
Just patrol officers following the clock.
Working the graveyard shift and everything.
They had been into a fast-food restaurant. And she had a malt.
This car came by, these two dudes in it, with no lights on.
It wasn't a serious problem...
but he just pulled up, turned his lights on to stop him.
Just to warn the man that his lights were off.
Got out of the car and walked up.
Before he got to the window, where the driver was... he was in the right position.
This man just turned around and just... with a little small-caliber pistol.
The first shot hit him in the arm.
He had his flashlight. It hit the flashlight and went into his arm.
The next one hit him right in the chest.
The officer falls in the street and he was in the first traffic lane.
He lay there and bled to death.
So she's out of the car.
She empties her pistol at the fleeing suspect...
and she runs to his aid.
Procedure says you grab the radio and call for an ambulance.
Common sense would tell you that.
But what do you do?
And that time, she's so... just tore down.
And the blood.
An enormous amount of blood.
How do we hold her responsible for not following procedure?
But the main thing was, she couldn't remember the license number.
When we started putting facts together on how much information we had... from the leads we had, we found out we didn't have anything.
The only thing that we knew we were looking for was a blue Vega.
Probably every Vega that was registered in the state of Texas...
was stopped and checked.
We had people calling the office... saying, "I've got a Vega and it's not blue.
"But would you come out and be sure to check it.
"Be sure it's not mine, because
I don't want to get stopped anymore.
"I'm afraid."
If you're the investigator assigned to the murder... you get frustrated with other witnesses.
But when you got a police officer that witnessed it... you expect that they would know a little more than she knew.
Procedure.
When there's a two-person unit, when either one approaches the car...
the other positions himself to the right rear...
where they can watch all the activity in the car.
And if the man on the left of the driver gets in trouble...
their partner is in a position to help.
Speculation was, at the time... that his partner was sitting in the car.
That's where the discrepancies were.
Just a matter of time, and whether or not she was out of the car...
completely out of the car, or partially in the car...
or just sitting in there with the door closed.
And the thing I think we did then that really helped...
It didn't really help anything at all.
Let me back up.
But it was interesting, and it cost a lot of money... but it was worthwhile.
You got to cover every trail.
A guy out of California...
I don't recall his name, he was an expert in hypnosis.
He came down, hypnotized her and questioned her.
What was interesting was... she couldn't remember anything particularly about the car.
She remembered getting a malt.
They'd stopped in the fast-food.
It was a Whataburger.
They remembered all that, and stopping the car.
Got back on the road.
She didn't remember anything.
But she remembered a license number off a hit-and-run vehicle... that they had worked earlier in the night.
It was getting awfully close to Christmas.
We'd never gone that long in Dallas without clearing a murder of an officer.
We'd had several killed, but we'd cleared them pretty quick.
And this case had gone a month, or nearly a month... and we still hadn't cleared it.
We finally got the break that cleared it.
It came out of Vidor, Texas.
Mr. Calvin Cunningham, who lives in Vidor, had his home broken into... and his little Mercury Comet stolen.
We felt as though
David had committed that crime.
For several days, though, he was missing. We couldn't find him.
It was one afternoon, one of our officers spotted Cunningham's car... on North Main Street, here in Vidor.
David abandoned the vehicle and ran on foot.
We started getting little bits of information, though... that David had been involved in a shooting in Dallas of a police officer.
We would always get third-hand rumor, fourth-hand rumor.
So we went back to a few of his other comrades in crime, we could call them.
They said,
"We thought he was just bragging.
"We didn't really take him seriously."
Sitting down, watching the evening news, well, the night news.
My father was asleep on the couch.
Heard somebody knocking at the door.
It was David Harris.
I let him in. He came in.
He was standing there beside my chair... and a news broadcast advertised about a police officer shot in Dallas.
Right then and there he starts swearing up and down.
He says, "I swear to God,
I shot that fucking pig."
He says, "I'm the one that killed him."
Somewhere around Dallas, they got pulled over.
I think he said because they were checking out a stolen car.
He said that the cop had pulled him over... and walked up to the window.
When the cop came, he rolled down the window... and just pulled the gun up and shot him.
He swore up and down.
He made a big scene about it.
Jumped up and down... trying to get anybody and everybody... to listen to him.
"Yeah, I shot that son of a gun."
And everybody said,
"Sure you did, David. Sure."
"I swear to God I killed that cop."
I asked him if he'd been to Dallas.
He denied having been to Dallas.
I asked him if he'd been involved in any shooting... or knew anything about a shooting, and he denied that to the end.
Which is fairly consistent with David.
Even if he had some involvement... his first way that he always treats you, he would deny.
Then, if he felt as though you really knew he had done it... then he would be truthful with you.
He give me a pistol, a .22 caliber pistol.
He showed it to me. He says,
"That's the one I shot him with."
He gave me the pistol.
I didn't really consider it that much.
I don't guess I really realized he did shoot the cop.
He led me to a swampy area... several hundred yards behind his residence in Rose City.
There was a sock under water.
He said, "There it is."
And he had sprayed this sock with boot oil.
When we retrieved the gun...
I said, "I better do something with it.
It's going to rust up."
Even the time that I saw the gun at the trial in Dallas... it looked just as good as when I'd taken it out of the swamp.
So he had taken pretty good care of it, even though he did put it under water.
He got to thinking...
"I didn't do that and I've been saying that I did...
"and I'm in over my head now,
I better tell them what happened.
"Because they are going to send me to the penitentiary for life...
"if I don't tell them what really happened."
So he said,
"I am just bragging about this.
"I didn't do it, but I was there, and I know who did do it."
And, of course, he came clean then.
He tried to hide no facts.
He just seemed like a friendly kid.
I may have talked to him
15 or 20 minutes on a friendly basis... just to keep him friendly.
We didn't want to make him mad.
But we didn't want him to tell us something that he thought.
We wanted him to tell us what we knew.
It wasn't very long until I realized that what he knew... was the facts of the case, and it matched with what we knew.
And it had to be right.
The story that I told was...
It was like 12:00 something.
So it was the next day... early in the morning. We were stopped.
When we were stopped, the officer came up to the car... and asked to see the driver's license, and he just started shooting.
I don't know why, but it's always seemed like time just stopped.
It didn't seem like any time passed.
It just seemed like it was, boom!
Time stopped or something.
I don't know what it is.
It's like a flash.
We went back to his room.
He was supposed to ask his brother if I could stay there that night.
But he said that his brother don't like to do that.
Anyhow, he went in and never came back out. So I left.
Ended up pulling into a parking lot.
I slept there I think, for a while.
Then, finally, the next morning, early or something...
I found my way to Freeway 45.
And went back home.
After riding around with him,
I come to find out he's got an arsenal.
He's got pistols. He's got rifles.
He's got this pistol.
He's waving it around. He's doing this.
I told him, "Hey, why don't you put those in the trunk of the car?"
We stopped at a restaurant... and ordered and ate sandwiches in the car.
I bought a six-pack of beer.
He pulled this pistol back out.
And I ask him why he got the pistol out.
And he kind of laughed... rolled the window down, and fired the pistol outside the car.
And I asked him to please put it up.
And I think he handed me the pistol, and I put it under the driver's seat.
He wanted to go to the movies, so we went to the movies.
We got there probably at about 7:00.
He was the one that had picked the movie out.
I call them drive-in movies, beer-drinking movies.
$0.50, put them together and make a bunch of money...
with a bunch of people getting drunk at the drive-in.
- Are you going to concede?
- Please, sit down...
What is this, Mr. Brooks?
- Anybody can see it's an ashtray.
- Wrong!
Anybody can plainly see it's a wall-breaker!
I'm trying to speak for you!
I'm trying to speak for all of you!
I am the student body!
The show that was on was half over.
We watched half of the one show...
we started watching the first part of the second show.
We want a victory, and we're gonna get it.
I didn't really care for the second feature...
which is an R-rated, cheerleader-type thing.
I don't know what it was.
May I have some wine?
It's good, Ross.
I didn't know you could cook.
It is good, isn't it?
You got to try my celery rémoulade.
No.
I told him I wanted to leave.
"I don't really care to sit here and watch this. Let's go."
He's acting strange, he wanted to watch the end. Anyway, we left.
We drove back towards Dallas and we drove to the motel.
There's a little store.
I bought a pack of cigarettes...
and a newspaper.
And when I left, this kid was still sitting there.
I leaned against the car and we talked to him for a few minutes... and I told him that since he was looking for a job... and there hadn't been anybody at work... that if he wanted to stop back
Monday morning... that sure, he could ride out and follow me to work... and he could talk to the boss.
And he would probably get a job.
I told him that I would catch him
Monday morning if he showed up.
I told him what time I went to work.
Why, I left.
I walked around the store and went to the house.
When I walked in, the television was on and my brother was sleeping.
He had been home this whole time that I had been gone.
So I made me a sandwich...
and sat there and watched the end of
The Carol Burnett Show.
When it went off, the news came on and I watched 15 minutes of it.
And that was it.
I turned the TV off and went to sleep.
Finally, they bring in a stenographer.
She sits down and I run the story.
I tell them what happened this Saturday.
She leaves. She types.
She comes back in about 25 to 30 minutes...
with a copy of this statement.
I read through it...
and when it was basically what I liked...
yes, I signed it.
He admits driving the car and taking a right on Inwood Road... off of Interstate 35... or Highway 183.
He admits driving it.
After he made his right turn on Inwood Road...
this is where our statement ends.
He says he does not remember anything after that.
He didn't remember anything about a shooting.
He didn't remember anything about a police officer stopping him.
That part of his mind just conveniently went blank.
He remembered driving the car... and he remembered approaching the scene of the shooting... and then, from that point, he blacks out... and can't remember until he gets to the motel room... which is some 10 minutes later.
Everything else he remembers vividly.
And that's just a convenient memory lapse, is all that is.
The Morning News in Dallas County... stated that I had signed a confession... that I had confessed to the killing of Robert Wood... and they had their killer and they were ready to go with it.
The statement that I signed for Dallas County... was never... and never would have been anything as "a confession."
But yet, they labeled it as such.
Of course, I couldn't dispute this because I didn't even know about it.
I heard no news.
I knew nothing for two weeks.
They kept me completely away from everybody.
Several times we talked to her, trying to get her to recall.
"Do you recall the license number?
Do you recall anything to help us?"
And she gave us a pretty good description of the car.
As it turned out, her description of the car was real close.
It comes out that we weren't looking for a blue Vega.
We were looking for a Comet.
No telling the man-hours we literally wasted... looking for a blue Vega.
There is a difference between a Vega and a Mercury Comet.
So in reality, in regard to cars... every piece of information that was called in... they were calling in regard to a Comet,
I mean, a Vega.
The people that called in were truthful, trying to help.
They really were trying to help.
We just all had the wrong information.
There wasn't a mark on this car
David Harris had stolen.
Wasn't a mark.
Do you think a car sitting still... starting from a stop, heading up a hill... with a woman standing right behind it...
that is a very good shot with a pistol...
She should have hit the damn thing one time. She didn't.
I wish to God she had blown whoever was driving the car's head off... because I wouldn't have been here.
I went back several times... and with Mr. Cunningham, he and I both searched... and could find no indications that that car had been hit by gunfire.
Later on, he finally found one place... that he felt as though that a bullet had been creased on it.
But before he could tell me about it, his daughter totaled the car out.
Totally demolished it.
I was doing burglaries and some robberies... and a few possession cases and stuff like that.
I think he just came up to me and said:
"Are you Edith James?
I'd like to talk about my case."
That's the way I remember it, anyhow.
And I said, "Sure."
And I said, "What sort of a case is it?"
He said, "It's a capital murder." And I said...
Inside, I kind of thought:
"I've never done one, but I can surely talk to him about it."
I hate to be considered... some kind of dummy that believes in the innocence of her clients.
A lot of people think,
"A woman lawyer...
"she's bound to stupidly believe anything she's told."
I admit, I'm sort of a gullible person.
But on the other hand,
I've seen an awful lot of people... who admitted guilt or were found guilty... and all but Randall turned out to be guilty, in my opinion.
Douglas Mulder had a perfect win record.
I believe he resigned from the
D.A. 's office without any defeats.
That's why he's legendary.
Everything, as I recall, that Mulder ever said... was about what a great guy Mulder was...
and how marvelous it was that he was getting all these convictions.
I wanted somebody else in on it, so I got Dennis interested in it... because Dennis has a lot more trial experience... and Dennis wins practically all of his jury cases.
And Dennis was very enthusiastic about the Randall Adams case... because he kept saying,
"This is one we can win.
"They don't have substantial evidence.
All they've got is David Harris."
I prepared a motion for a continuance to get more time to try the case... and in doing that had to lay out my schedule for several weeks... as to exactly what time
I'd be in Vidor, Texas.
Vidor is the headquarters of the
Ku Klux Klan for the state of Texas.
It's a city where black people will not spend the night.
Black people won't even stop there to get their car filled with gasoline.
And furthermore, the people of Vidor were under the impression...
that the policeman that was murdered was a black man.
I had to stop at a motel on the way.
My wife and I stayed in one room, the lady lawyer in another room.
We arranged to get up very early, go to Vidor and start our investigation.
At about 6:00 in the morning...
Edith James, the lady lawyer, got up... and was looking for me.
While she went out in the parking lot to find me, she went to one room... and someone in the parking lot said:
"If you're looking for the lawyer from Dallas...
"he's in room..."
And he gave her the room number.
I immediately began to suspect... from the time I was that close to Vidor,
I was being followed and observed.
Doug Mulder had been there the week before I had...
and had told the people in Vidor that I was... an Eastern-educated civil liberties attorney... and that I was down there to discredit David Harris.
And then I had been recommended to see one particular policeman... who had been led to the solution of this case.
And I had the impression... that he was the one honest policeman
I could trust in Vidor.
He told me that after the policeman was killed...
David Harris went back to Vidor.
But before he was arrested, he committed a robbery down there... and had someone on the floor of a 7-Eleven type of store... with a shotgun at her throat.
Got back there... robbed O'Bannion's 7-Eleven with a.22 rifle.
Committed some other burglaries and what have you.
All this time I was on probation.
Juvenile probation.
Eventually I turned myself in for this stuff in Vidor.
I think I made a confession.
I can't even remember exactly.
So I'm told I did.
He had told us he had robbed stores, and we laughed.
"Sure, we know you have."
I'd given him one of my hats.
It's an old Bonnie-and-Clyde-looking hat, it's turned sideways.
We said, "We'll draw you a little mustache, walk in with that gun.
"Nobody'll know who you are."
About 2:00 that morning,
I was asleep and the phone rings.
I said, "Hello?" He said, "This is
David." "This is David Harris?"
"Yeah," he said, "I did it.
Will you come and get me?"
I said, "I'm not coming to get you.
I'm asleep."
He didn't have a conscience.
If I do something bad, it kind of gets to me.
I feel, "Shucks, I shouldn't have done that. I feel bad about it."
But it didn't bother him.
Didn't bother him at all.
We asked the D.A. In Vidor, Texas... what they were going to do with little David. They said:
"We'll send him to the Texas Youth Council."
And we sort of tried to inquire... didn't he think it was strange that there was a robbery committed... with that same pistol.
And here it was David Harris' pistol...
David Harris' automobile that picked up Randall Adams.
Didn't he think it was a little odd... that all the utensils for committing this so-called murder... were furnished by David Harris who got off scot-free... and was being a witness for the prosecution?
And all he said was, "We don't feel that way in Vidor, Texas.
"Our people just are not that...
"We're not that keen on ruining a young man's life."
I tried to introduce the crime spree theory.
The theory that David Harris was on this series of crimes... both before and after the killing of the policeman.
That he would be the person who had... the heart filled with malice most apt to commit a murder.
But the judge would not allow me to introduce any of those crimes.
They'd had a 28-year-old man.
The only alternative would be prosecuting a 16-year-old... that could not be given the death penalty under Texas law... where our 28-year-old man could.
That's always been the predominant motive, in my opinion... for having a death penalty case against Randall Adams.
Not that they had him so dead to rights.
But just that he was a convenient age.
The judge is supposed to have said...
That Don Metcalfe is supposed to have said... to Jeanette White,
Dennis White's wife...
"What do you care? He's only a drifter."
I grew up in a family... where I was taught a great respect for law enforcement.
I became acutely aware of the dangers... that police officers go through, law enforcement officials go through... that I think much of the public is not really sensitive to.
My father was an FBI man.
Probably at the worst possible time to be in the FBI.
It was from 1932 to 1935 in Chicago.
He was at the Biograph Theater the night that Dillinger was killed.
It was a hot summer evening.
Little air conditioning in Chicago...
and people were out for a walk.
My father would tell me that when Dillinger was killed...
within a matter of two minutes...
people were dipping their handkerchiefs in the blood... to get souvenirs.
And he vividly remembered one lady... who, all she had was a newspaper, held it up and said:
"I bet I'm the only lady from Kansas
City with John Dillinger's blood."
He told me, the "Woman in Red"... she had on an orange dress.
This is trivia, okay?
It looked red under the lights.
He said it was really orange.
So she got to be known as the
"Lady in Red" that fingered Dillinger.
He said, "It was really the Lady in Orange."
As her reward, she got a new fur coat... and a one-way ticket back to her native Romania.
His whole story from the start was two hours late.
I met this kid at around 10:00 in the morning.
He says we met at noon.
I say we were at the Bronco Bowl at 2:00 or 3:00.
He says it was 5:00 or 6:00.
Everything that we did coincide with, he was two hours late.
Two hours later.
Two hours into the night.
His testimony is that...
as we were getting off the freeway on Inwood Avenue... he stated that I'm driving the car... that we're pulled over.
He gets scared and he slumps down in the seat of the car.
That, as the officer walks up...
and shines his flashlight, and I roll down my window...
I pull the pistol out and blow this man away.
His testimony is... when I finally do drive to the motel...
I get out. I tell him,
"Don't worry about it.
"Forget this ever happened."
That's crazy.
The police officer was killed at 12:30... which is about two and a half hours after he last saw me.
Just before he went into the motel... he'd gone across the motel courtyard... to a little store over there and bought some cigarettes.
And I was supposed to go and find out if the man remembered him... coming in there just before 10:00 to buy the cigarettes.
I didn't get over there to Fort Worth for a long time.
We got some pictures from his family that didn't show him in jail clothes.
I took the pictures in to show them to the man behind the counter.
He was very cooperative and he wanted to help us.
But he honestly... He said:
"I don't remember anything about this guy coming in there...
"I couldn't tell one night from another.
Might have been that night or another.
"Cause they were always coming for cigarettes."
His brother... at first... was saying that at the time of the murder, that he was home... watching... I believe it was a wrestling match on TV.
And he said, "Me and my brother likes wrestling matches. He was with me.
"Randall, my brother, was with me all night long.
"He couldn't have done it."
He was trying to cover for his brother.
Later, as I recall, he changed... because he said:
"If I get down there and perjure myself...
"there's nothing that they can do because they've got the case."
This is the way I think that he thought.
"They know that my brother did it.
"If I get up there and lie, they are going to have me for perjury.
"I'll be in the penitentiary with him, and it ain't going to do any good...
"so I just ain't going to testify.
I ain't gonna say nothing."
So he backed off of his story completely... and Adams was left without any witnesses.
Her in-court testimony and her original statement... which should be the best.
You're talking 15 to 20 minutes after the killing.
Should be the best eyewitness testimony she's got.
It doesn't match. Doesn't match at all.
In court, she testified... he got out of the car, she got out of the car.
She positioned herself at the back of the automobile.
Her original statement,
15 minutes after the killing...
"a fur-lined collar on the killer."
In court,
"It might have been bushy hair."
The kid testified that I had a Levi jacket on... which is the same type collar, basically the same as this.
He testified at pretrial that he had a fur-lined parka.
She's telling you who killed the man.
One person in the car with the fur-lined collar.
Very convenient that the driver happened to have bushy hair.
All she's got to do is look at a picture they took of me.
But that is not her original statement.
It's a hell of a big difference from "fur-lined collar" to "bushy hair."
It's crazy.
She went through two weeks Internal Affairs... when she comes out, her testimony changes.
She goes in saying one thing, she comes out saying another.
Something happened. What?
"We refreshed her memory."
Friday afternoon,
I think it was Good Friday... we came back in the courtroom that afternoon...
and we were sort of elated because we thought...
"He's gonna walk."
And there's nothing really in that evidence.
There's just little David Harris, and nobody believes him.
And so we were very optimistic about his chances... until we walked into the courtroom... and here were all these people standing in front of the bench.
Three of them, anyway.
They were taking the oath to be sworn as witnesses.
Mrs. Miller got on the stand that last afternoon.
And she said,
"That's the man, I saw that man!
"I saw Randall Adams' face just right after..."
She said, "I saw the gun sticking out of the car...
"when he shot that police officer.
And that's the man."
And she waved her finger right toward Randall Adams.
She's the one that got him convicted.
When I was a kid,
I used to want to be a detective... because I used to watch all the detective shows on TV.
When I was a kid they used to show these movies with Boston Blackie...
and he always had a woman with him.
I wanted to be a wife of a detective or be a detective... so I always watched detective stories.
I'm always looking because
I never know what might come up.
Or how I could help.
I like to help in situations like that.
I really do.
It's always happening to me, everywhere I go... lots of times there's killings or anything.
Even around my house. Wherever.
I'm always looking or getting involved, to find out who did it, what's going on.
I listen to people.
And I'm always trying to decide who's lying, or who killed who... before the police do.
See if I can beat them.
Yeah.
I was working at a gas station.
My husband and I both.
We weren't getting along well at all.
We were arguing back and forth.
We didn't wanna go home, because we'd rather talk it out in the car... than go home with the kids and fight.
Had to listen to them, too.
So we were really arguing, and decided to get something to eat.
About that time, a police came out of a restaurant... on the right hand side of the road...
and he went to pull the man over.
She turned around.
She was looking hard. She looked.
I didn't think she seen the guy, but she did.
Because I said, "What you looking at?"
I knew something had went wrong.
She said, "You just shut up and drive."
And I kept telling my husband:
"Slow down so I can see."
He said, "Come on, we're getting out of here.
"You're too nosy.
You don't even know what's going on."
I had no idea that somebody was gonna get killed or shot.
So I just drove on.
He was one of these kind that didn't like getting involved.
He wanted to go on. He told me to shut up and turn around. Don't look.
I turned around and looked anyway.
So we heard something, like backfire or firecrackers.
And so we drove over the bridge, and I got to thinking.
I said: "Em, there're no firecrackers this time of the year."
I was thinking to myself:
"That couldn't be somebody shooting."
It was real dark, and it was cold.
It was hard to see in that car.
But his window was down.
The driver's window was down.
This is how I got such a good look.
I really couldn't see anything inside.
It was kind of... shadows on the window and stuff.
But when he rolled down the window, what made his face stand out so.
The car was dark blue.
He had a beard, mustache... kind of dishwater-blond hair.
But, like I said, when he was in court, he sure looked a lot different.
All I could just tell by this and this, that it was him.
I knew that there was some shots over there.
But I didn't want to be involved in it... because West Dallas is a high-crime neighborhood.
One of the biggest.
He was more scared of it than I was.
But when you have black people like that... they don't like getting involved in nothing.
That's just common.
Like here, nobody wants to see nothing or hear nothing.
And they'll stay completely in the background.
That's why they were having such a hard time there... finding anybody that would come forward.
Because it was in a totally black neighborhood.
She believe in, see somebody done something wrong she should tell it.
'Cause she told on me... a couple of times... that I was hauling drugs out of El Paso.
Called the sheriff down there, going to make me open my trunk.
So I ended up opening it, but there was nothing in it.
Good grief.
She's a ho, but she find out you done something, she turn you in.
Mrs. Miller had testified at the trial... that she had gotten off early from her gas station job... and gone down to pick up her husband to help him with the bookwork.
We found out that she was not doing any bookkeeping for that station... because she had been fired from her job two weeks earlier... for till-tapping, for stealing.
The reason that they were talking to the police at all... was that there'd been a three-day running knife fight in their apartment.
And they were all booked... for disorderly and drunk behavior in there... including assault with knives, and all kinds of stuff.
When they were at the police station, they suddenly decided to volunteer... all this information about what they had seen...
about the police officer's killing.
A woman called me at my home... and said that she knew this woman... who had testified and identified
Randall Adams from a passing vehicle.
This woman had never told the truth in her life.
She also told me that she had tried to call the D.A. During the trial... and give this evidence that this woman was not believable.
If their case hinged on this testimony, this was not believable testimony.
They were scum. They were just... actually scum.
He was a black man and she was a white woman.
He came to work the day after.
He told me about the policeman that had gotten shot the night before.
And I hadn't heard anything about it.
And I thought it was another one of these stories.
And he brings in these newspapers... and he says he didn't see a thing.
He couldn't see nothing, it was dark.
Wheels started rolling in his head about money.
That's when he got the idea.
Let me put it in his words.
For enough money, he would testify... to what they wanted him to say.
He would say anything they wanted him to say.
Or he would see anything that they wanted him to see.
Those were his words.
I was shocked that he did go ahead... and get up and tell that he saw the actual shooting... and recognized the boy. Identified him.
That's when I called Dennis White.
I told him, "That man's lying."
Nobody has that good of an eyesight.
From where the policeman was shot and from where they were at...
I doubt if you could have even seen them with binoculars.
I'm a salesman.
And you develop something like total recall.
I don't forget places, things... or streets.
Because it's a habit, something I just picked up.
I just stare intensely at people and try to figure them out.
Being nosy, I just stare.
I was leaving the Plush Pub one night... driving a 1977 Cadillac...
heading west on Hampton.
I noticed an officer had two individuals pulled over... to the curb in a blue...
some type of vehicle.
It was a blue...
It was a blue Ford.
It was a blue something.
The driver, I think, had long blond hair and a moustache.
And the other one didn't have no hairs on his face.
A person that is white going through that area at night... he's a sore thumb, he stick out for the first reason.
And if they don't look right, they're gonna stop you.
The officer, he walked up to the vehicle.
His car was behind...
I don't know if it was behind or in front... but I know he had him pulled over, and he was up to the car.
I think he was up to the car.
Let me think.
Yeah, he was up to the car.
As we was coming by he had to have been up to the car.
I didn't see no bullet.
I didn't see no gunfire.
Because I went on.
We have three people that testified and identified him... positively as being the driver at the time that Wood was walking... right beside the car.
So we know that he was the driver from the witnesses... and we also know... that it was the driver that shot Officer Wood... coming from his partner.
We couldn't have made a case...
with the voluntary statement that we got from Adams.
We had to rely on witnesses.
And this is what we did.
I always tried very hard, every judge I know of does... to not show emotion on the bench.
The reason, if you do show emotion... the jury might take it that you're favoring one side or another.
So you try to remain passive, emotionless, objective.
I do have to admit that in the Adams case... and I've never really said this...
Doug Mulder's final argument was one I'd never heard before.
About the "thin blue line" of police... that separated the public from anarchy.
I have to concede that there my eyes kind of welled up... when I heard that.
It did get to me emotionally, but I don't think I showed it.
In death penalty cases... we have a question, or we did at the time... of whether or not that person is of a dangerous mentality... and might be expected to commit other crimes.
To answer that question...
the Dallas District Attorney sends psychiatrists to the defendant's cell... to discover whether he is without remorse... and therefore is a dangerous and psychopathic personality.
Of course, in the instance of a person... who did not commit the crime, they're not going to show remorse.
There were two psychiatrists that appeared again and again.
Holbrook and Grigson, the "Killer Shrinks."
There was certain criticism directed against these two people... because, in effect, whenever they showed up, the purpose of their visit... was to kill the defendant.
It was April 15th, tax day.
I think I was filling out my taxes at the time.
Afraid I might be late.
A guard walks up to the door... tells me, "There's someone out here who wants to talk to you."
I ask him who it was.
He said he didn't know... but the court ordered me to talk to him. I said, "All right."
And here come this real tall, ostrich-looking dude.
He introduced himself as Dr. Grigson.
He pulled a pad out of his coat pocket... that had a line drawn across it.
On this pad, on the upper half... he had six images.
I will say a box, a square, a circle with a diamond in it.
I don't... It's been awhile.
He slides this piece of paper across to me and he hands me a pencil.
He says,
"I'm going to get a cup of coffee.
"Please copy what's on this piece of paper."
I'm looking at this man.
I said, "What? You want it copied just the same way you did?
"Or you want me to change them around? What do you want me to do?"
He said, "Just do whatever you think you want to do."
And he left.
So on the bottom half of this piece of paper...
I made my boxes and X's... and zeros with diamonds in it.
Exactly like his.
He asked me...
"What's the meaning of
'A rolling stone gathers no moss?"'
I'm looking at this man.
I said, "Are you kidding? Is this a joke? What are you doing?"
He said, "No, I really want to know your answer to that question."
I said, well,
"A rolling stone gathers no moss."
I said, "To me...
"it would represent that a person that doesn't stand still long enough...
"it's kind of hard for people to cling to him.
"If he keeps moving around, it's hard to get close to him."
He shook his head.
He said, "What about 'A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"'?
I said, "If you have a hold of something, why give it up...
"for a chance of getting something that might be a little better?
"It doesn't make sense. You've got something good, why let go of it?
"If you can get the other one, get it if you can...
"but don't let go of what you got to try to get something else."
He asked about my family.
He asked about my background.
And he left.
Total time we had talked, maybe 15, 20 minutes.
Dr. Grigson was up there testifying he would commit violent crimes... in the future if he was released.
Grigson is known as "Dr. Death" because he always testifies that way.
In about 99% of the trials...
that he's been a witness for the prosecution, he always testifies...
that they will commit violent crimes in the future.
You can't tell what somebody's gonna do years from now.
Not really.
Except based on your past record, which anybody can do.
Randall never had any prior record.
And as far as we know, he never had any history of violence whatever.
Grigson testified for... two and a half hours about all these degrees he's got.
He's been here, and he's been there, and he's studied here.
He called me Charlie Manson.
He called me Adolf Hitler.
He said I'm the type of personality... that can work all day and creep all night.
He testified, Grigson... that the future seriousness... of my mental state... would be such that if they released me...
I would go crazy and probably butcher half of Dallas County.
Even though he talked to me
15 minutes...
I have no prior convictions, no prior arrests...
I was nonviolent for 28 years.
On one instance... and that's saying if I did this, which I didn't...
he's stating that, that's enough...
For the rest of my life, watch me.
Don't ever turn your back on me.
And he talked to me 15 minutes.
He's crazy.
You can understand why a man might steal if he needs money... to put food on the table.
I can understand why a 17-year-old boy who doesn't have a car... would steal one to ride around in.
I can understand why the heroin addict needs heroin.
But it's very hard to understand why anybody has to kill a police officer.
It just doesn't have to be.
When I'm asleep and I close my eyes and think...
"Why would he do it?
"He had no background that would lead to murder...
"no reason to commit a murder."
And I look at the facts of the case and say...
David Harris knew the car was stolen, knew the guns were there... knew the guns were stolen... was on a crime spree... had had a criminal record prior to stealing this car and these guns.
He was the one that wanted to commit the murder... and get away from the scene.
He was the one that, after the murder was committed... went right back home and bragged about it to his friends.
I looked at all the evidence... and I found that I believed that David Harris committed murder.
The jury looked at the same evidence... and found they believed that
Randall Adams committed murder.
And it was their verdict that counted.
You have a D. A... he doesn't talk about... when they convict you or how they convict you... he's talking about how he's going to kill you.
He don't give a damn if you're innocent.
He don't give a damn if you're guilty.
He's talking about killing you.
You get numb. You get...
It's like a bad dream. You want to wake up, but you can't do it.
Fifteen times, 20 times a day,
I hear this same story... about what happens when a man is electrocuted.
His eyeballs pop out.
His fingernails pop out.
His toenails pop out.
He bleeds out of every orifice he's got.
They don't care...
They don't care.
All they want to do is talk about how they're going to kill you.
That's the only thing that they cared about and talked about.
At that point, that's all they're wanting.
I didn't have any idea what happened to him.
After I testified, I was gone.
I never really concerned myself with it.
Maybe I didn't want to know.
I don't know.
I didn't have any interest in knowing... otherwise I might have tried to find out.
Dennis filed the motion for a new trial...
then we filed an amended motion for a new trial.
About 20 days later, we were to have a hearing on it.
Both Robert Miller and his wife testified there.
But we could not bring out the fact... that they had said that they were gonna get that reward money... and that they didn't care whether they saw anything or not... but their car was too steamed up.
We were not allowed to get any of that in... because it was held that it was impeaching testimony... and therefore it came too late.
We kept running into blank walls.
A reporter from the Dallas Morning News... discovered that one week after the trial was over with... the daughter of this woman had a robbery case in this court.
She offered her testimony...
at a time when her daughter was in danger of going to jail for life...
and got her daughter out of jail.
How can you believe her... when the very next week the same judge dismisses that case?
The Millers are the kind of people that would do anything... if there was something to be gained... such as her daughter not being sent to the penitentiary for armed robbery... or for money.
When we went to court that day, the District Attorney was hard-nosed.
Wouldn't let me answer any questions.
He'd ask me questions, but then he'd cut me off real short.
And that's when he said something about my big fat nose.
If I'd kept my big fat nose out of their business... the Millers would be better off.
When I started to leave out of the courtroom... he started laughing, like:
"Didn't do you any good to get up here."
It really didn't.
Didn't help the guy at all.
To the best of my recollection... the brief conversations
I have had with Mr. Adams... and they have been brief...
I don't even recall ever asking him, or my having told me... that he did not do it.
Because, for my purposes, representing him on appeal...
it's totally irrelevant.
When the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas... voted 9-0 against us,
I was a little upset about that.
I felt we, A: Should have won...
B: Certainly shouldn't have been slapped so hard... with the unanimous decision against us.
I was with my family in an ice-cream parlor... and the judge and his family happened to come at the same time.
And he came over to me and made the comment...
"I see where the Court of Criminal
Appeals gave me an 'A'...
"in the Adams case."
Our highest state appellate court... the Court of Criminal Appeals in Austin affirmed the case, 9-0.
Then it was reversed by the
United States Supreme Court, 8-1...
When the Appellate Court reverses a case... they are never saying the trial judge was right or wrong.
They are saying they disagree with the judge.
You can't, for instance, in the Adams appeals... say the appellate courts were saying I was right or I was wrong.
After all, if in Austin... in our state appeals court,
I was 9-0 correct... and in Washington, I was 1-8 incorrect.
If you tally all those votes,
I come out 10-8.
Yet the case was reversed.
Eight justices of the Supreme Court were the first people to agree with me.
They're the only people anywhere that ever agreed about that statute...
were eight justices of the Supreme Court.
The Dallas Morning News had a very nice front-page story... either the same day... or the day after the reversal was announced by the Supreme Court... in which Henry Wade, the District Attorney...
vowed a retrial of Randall Dale Adams...
because there was no room in his book for a cop-killer...
getting off with anything less than the death penalty.
I took that to heart. I thought
I was going to get my chance.
For reasons that were never really made public...
Mr. Wade requested the governor to commute...
Mr. Adams' death penalty to life... and that eliminated the possibility of a retrial... based on the reversal.
I was absolutely shocked.
I can't help but believe... that some of the motivation behind that decision... was a fear that...
Adams may be vindicated at a retrial.
I just felt they prosecuted the wrong person. I don't know why.
I felt that some policeman, whether in Vidor or in Dallas... made a decision to prosecute and set the wheels of justice in motion... in the wrong direction and they got going so fast no one could stop them.
So I felt it was up to me to stop them and I didn't.
I felt it was up to the Supreme Court and they did what they could, but... it's all gotten messed up and derailed again.
Since his trial, I have given up my practice of criminal law.
I have not had a jury trial... since I heard the verdict of this jury in this case... and don't intend to.
I just feel like...
I'll let other people handle these problems for a while.
Because if justice can miscarry so badly...
I'd rather do something else.
Prosecutors in Dallas have said for years...
"Any prosecutor can convict a guilty man.
"It takes a great prosecutor to convict an innocent man."
To this day, I think Mr. Mulder... believes that the Adams conviction was one of his great victories... probably because of some reservations he has about Adams' guilt.
I got a call one morning, a lady here in Vidor... had been hit over the head with a rolling pin... and the attacker thought she'd been knocked unconscious... when, in reality, she wasn't.
And she recognized the attacker to be David Harris.
He voluntarily came to the police station.
I told him,
"David, this girl knows who you are.
"I don't even have to tell you
I know the truth.
"You know I know the truth this time."
He said, "I was wrong.
I smoked marijuana, I was drinking.
"I don't know what got over me but something just came over me."
But he forgot to mention one thing, that he was only wearing underwear.
I felt as though the attack was sexually oriented.
He never wanted to admit that... and, as I recall, he never really finally admitted it.
He'd just get to where he wouldn't deny it.
He posted his bond and went to Germany.
We had a crime with basically the same M.O. As his... and so it led me to want to check and see if he was in town.
I contacted the Worldwide Military Locator... to see if, through the military,
I could locate him.
I did, and found out that he was in prison at the time.
He really didn't remember what happened.
He said he woke up in the stockade...
and he'd been told that he beat up one of his ranking officers.
We had another occasion to have a crime that fit his M.O. A lot... so I started looking for him again, and this time...
I found him in prison in California.
So I realized again that unfortunately, he hadn't straightened up.
He was still having a lot of problems.
I was 16 years old.
I really didn't have no real dealings with the court systems, etc.
Didn't know how they worked, really.
Didn't know much about the law.
Just a young, dumb kid.
Police give you the time of this and the time this happened... and you just correlate from those events.
You just estimate from that event what time it was.
You don't know.
You're taking a guess.
Police tell you, "It was 12:30 when this crime happened.
"What time did you leave the movie?"
"I know it was somewhere around midnight.
"It might have been before then.
I don't know.
"I didn't have a watch on."
He went over my testimony with me pretty extensively.
How I should answer certain questions... things of this nature.
That's what you call
"coaching the witness."
Let's get this evidence in a spectrum where it's going to be most effective.
At the time,
I didn't really ponder on it... but he was deceiving the jury.
He wanted to deceive justice.
That's why I think that statue with the scales...
Justice? What is she called?
I don't know what she's called.
She's got that blindfold on.
We don't see what goes on behind the closed doors.
I had another woman in the car.
I didn't tell them about that.
My wife'd kill me.
She would've tore my head off if she knew I was out with another woman.
Would you tell?
That's what happened.
I was trying to get her home.
The driver's side was down because... the lady was a little sick.
She needed some air.
Because she was pretty drunk.
See, the Millers, one is black and one is white.
They said I was going with...
The reason I was over that night...
I was over there messing with this man's wife.
And I ain't never gone with her in my life. She was too old and ugly.
Like I said, the D.A. Will put something into their mouth.
They could have prefabricated the whole story.
They sure could have.
But what I saw is just what I saw.
That was it.
So if they got paid, they got paid for lying.
They already decided what to do with you in the hall.
That's why they call it the Hall of
Justice, the scales are not balanced.
The scales are in the hall, and they go up and down.
They might go up for you, favor one way, they might go down against you.
So if the D.A. Wants you to hang
15 or 20 years, you're hung.
I had all these charges still pending in Orange County.
I could have been certified as an adult... maybe given a life sentence.
I don't know.
I'm 16 years old.
I know I don't want that.
That District Attorney told me,
"Don't worry about them charges."
"I'm gonna ask your...
Defense Attorney is gonna ask you...
"if you had any kind of deal...
"or anything of that nature...
"in exchange for your testimony in this case...
"as relating to those charges.
"Don't answer that 'Yes.'
Answer it 'No."'
My husband, he didn't get that good a look at him.
He wasn't sure, because they put a bunch of them that looked alike.
They had about three or four in the lineup that had bushy hair... but he had his combed down, different to what it was in the killing.
I didn't pick him out right then... because I picked out this bushy-haired man.
I understand one other witness did pick out the man at the lineup.
I'm not sure, but I think he did.
Of course I picked out
Randall Adams just like that.
I don't know about the others.
Evidently they did at that time.
I just took off.
It's like, kids run away... they don't think about where they're going to stay... how they're going to eat, all these things.
They had that roof over their head all their lives.
They don't really think about those things... till you get out there and you say,
"My stomach's growling now."
Or, "It's getting cold out here.
It's raining."
There was ice on the road.
I remember there was a car coming pretty fast up the road behind me... and didn't see me or something... or was in one lane and came into the other lane and I was in that lane... and tried to stop me.
He went off the side of the road.
I remember this car went off the side of the road.
I'm just looking back.
I remember that.
I got a call at my house about 3:30 one morning.
One of the patrolmen in my department called... and said, "We just arrested this boy named David Harris...
"and he won't even tell us his name.
He said he wants to talk to you."
They told me something that really made me interested. He'd been shot.
David had initially told me that he had gone to a bar in Houston... and was flirting with a young lady and her boyfriend became upset... and chased him out with a pistol, shooting at him.
We knew that wasn't true.
I said,
"David, I know you're lying to me.
"We go through this all the time, all my dealings with you in the past.
"I don't know what you've done just yet.
"I know you were shot.
"I know you were shot doing something that you shouldn't have been...
"we know you burglarized a gun shop.
We know you were driving drunk.
"Got witnesses who can identify you, who can identify your truck."
I said, "You're caught.
So tell the truth."
And David said, "Okay, I killed him."
Their home was entered while he and his girlfriend were there alone.
The man was sent into the bathroom at gunpoint and told to stay there.
David took the girl and was starting to leave.
The man exited the apartment with a gun.
The man fell to the ground, or near the ground... holding onto a pole there in the parking lot of the apartment complex... and these last, whether it be two, three, or how many shots...
I don't know, were fired at point-blank or near point-blank range.
David thought that the one that was really at fault that night... was the guy that got killed.
He said, "That guy's crazy.
"He came after me with a gun."
I told him,
"David, you'd broken into his house...
"you abducted his girlfriend, what was he supposed to do?"
He said,
"Man shouldn't come out with a gun.
"That dude's crazy.
He should have been killed."
When we went to retrieve the pistol...
I had to go into the water to get it.
It was a bayou and it was grassy, snaky-looking area.
I was not real pleased about being there myself... but David enjoyed watching me have to go down there and look for the gun.
I'd been searching several minutes, he was up on the bridge... and probably 25 feet from me... directing me to where he thought that the gun had landed in the water.
He was handcuffed.
Traffic would come by, and he would turn around... and show them his handcuffs and holler at them, "Help me!
"The officials will throw me in this water and drown me."
Just anything he could do to make a joke and cut up out there.
He was just really having a good time.
The kid scares me.
To think that he could actually be out there, walking the streets... and Dallas County let him go.
The kid had seven crimes coming down on him.
He had armed robberies.
He had firing on a peace officer.
He had breaking and enterings, aggravated assaults.
God knows what all this kid had.
And Dallas County gives him complete immunity for his testimony.
Just lets him walk.
My mom had a good phrase.
She said the first night she pulled into Dallas, it was raining... and that it was lightning.
And they're coming into Dallas... and she said if there was ever a hell on earth, it's Dallas County.
She's right.
You deal with people who you sense bad vibrations, more or less.
You feel, this guy doesn't like me anyway because I'm a policeman.
You can just kind of sense something.
Maybe I shouldn't even be saying it... because police shouldn't take these things to the bank.
When you deal with people over and over, you sense a lot of things.
Talking to David, you don't ever feel hostile feelings coming from him.
I have never seen David any way... other than cordial, friendly to me as he could be:
"Yes, sir." "No, sir."
Never disrespectful.
I've never seen the bad side.
I've seen the results... and I've talked to him about it, and he's aware of it.
He remembers the bad side.
But I've never seen him committing a crime... or in a violent or volatile state.
When his crimes were confessed to... he seemed to feel better and do better during those times.
His parents would tell me he would to do better at home... he seemed to get along better with the people in town... his neighbors and friends.
But something happens to David...
I don't know what it is. I don't know if anybody can put their finger on it.
But there's no other indication of anything in the family...
that would lead you to believe he had exposure to these activities.
David's got at least one other brother and sister that I know of.
And he had one brother that drowned numerous years ago.
I was 3 years old...
I had a 4-year-old brother... and he drowned in 1963...
right after President Kennedy was assassinated, I believe.
Sometime right after that, during the summer.
We was living in Beaumont on Harrison Street...
and my dad was working on his truck out in the yard...
and mom was in the house doing her housework or fixing dinner.
Me and my brother, we had one of these little blow-up pools...
and we were playing in that.
My dad was supposed to be watching or keeping an eye on us or something.
My brother wandered off down the street...
and these people had a swimming pool in their backyard...
and they were elderly people.
They never used the pool.
I guess it had a bunch of leaves and stuff in it.
And he, evidently, fell in there and drowned.
I used to sit up in my room at night and talk to him and he wasn't there.
So that might have been some kind of a traumatic experience for me.
I guess my dad...
I don't know, maybe he couldn't get rid of the responsibility... or the guilt or something.
I don't know what it was.
I was there and I guess maybe
I reminded him of that... all the time, growing up.
It was hard for me to get any acceptance from him.
When my younger brother was born...
it was kind of like he was Daddy's favorite or something, I don't know.
Everybody's life is going to take some kind of path regardless of what happens.
I think maybe that a lot of the things
I did when I was younger... was an attempt to get back at him or something... for the way he treated me.
But I wasn't doing nothing but hurting myself.
Hi, I've got a tapewriter to play.
"Psycho Killer"
I can’t seem to face up to the facts I’m tense and nervous and I can’t relax.

"Heaven"
Everyone is trying to get to the bar. The name of the bar, the bar is called Heaven. The band in Heaven they play my favorite song. They play it one more time, they play it all night long.
Oh heaven, heaven is a place, a place where nothing, nothing ever happens. Heaven is a place, a place where nothing, nothing ever happens.
There is a party, everyone is there. Everyone will leave at exactly the same time. When this party’s over it will start again. It will not be any different, it will be exactly the same.
Heaven is a place, a place where nothing, nothing ever happens.
Heaven is a place, a place where nothing, nothing ever happens.
When this kiss is over it will start again. It will not be any different, it will be exactly the same. It’s hard to imagine that nothing at all could be so exciting, could be this much fun.
Oh, heaven, heaven is a place, a place where nothing, nothing ever happens.
Oh, heaven, heaven is a place, a place where nothing, nothing ever happens.
"Thank You For Sending
Me An Angel"
Oh, Oh, baby you can walk, you can talk just like me. You can walk, you can talk just like me. You can look, tell me what you see. You can look, you won’t see nothing like me if you look around the world.
Oh, baby you can walk, you can talk just like me. With a little practice, you can walk like, talk just like me. If that’s what you wanna do. Well, you can look, you’II walk in circles around me. But first, I’II walk in circles ’round you. But first, I’II walk around the world.

"Found a Job"
"Damn that television what a bad picture!" "Don’t get upset, it’s not a major disaster." "There’s nothing on tonight," he said, "I don’t know what’s the matter!" "Nothing’s ever on", she said, "so I don’t know why you bother."
We’ve heard this little scene, we’ve heard it many times. People fighting over little things, and wasting precious time.
They might be better off I think the way it seems to me. Making up their own shows, which might be better than T.V.
Judy’s in the bedroom, inventing situations. Bob is on the street today, scouting up locations. They’ve enlisted all their family. They’ve enlisted all their friends. It helped saved their relationship, And made it work again.
Their show gets real high ratings, they think they have a hit. There might even be a spinoff, but they’re not sure ’bout that. Just look at Bob and Judy; they’re happy as can be, Inventing situations, putting them on T.V.

"Life During Wartime"
Heard of a van that is loaded with weapons packed up and ready to go
Heard of some gravesites, out by the highway a place where nobody knows
The sound of gunfire, off in the distance I’m getting used to it now
Lived in a brownstone, lived in the ghetto I’ve lived all over this town
This ain’t no party, this ain’t no disco this ain’t no fooling around
No time for dancing, or lovey dovey I ain’t got time for that now
Transmit the message, to the receiver hope for an answer some day
I got three passports, couple of visas don’t even know my real name
High on a hillside, trucks are loading everything’s ready to roll I sleep in the daytime, I work in the nightime I might not ever get home
This ain’t no party, this ain’t no disco this ain’t no fooling around
This ain’t no mudd club, or C. B. G. B. I ain’t got time for that now
This ain’t no party, this ain’t no disco this ain’t no fooling around
No time for dancing, or lovey dovey I ain’t got time for that now
Heard about Houston? Heard about Detroit? Heard about Pittsburgh, PA?
You oughta know not to stand by the window somebody might see you up there
I got some groceries, some peanut butter to last a couple of days But I ain’t got no speakers ain’t got no headphones ain’t got no records to play
Why stay in college? Why go to night school? Gonna be different this time?
Can’t write a letter, can’t send a postcard I can’t write nothing at all
This ain’t no party, this ain’t no disco this ain’t no fooling around I’d love you hold you, I’d like to kiss you I ain’t got no time for that now
Trouble in transit, got through the roadblock we blended in with the crowd We got computers, we’re tapping phone lines I know that ain’t allowed
We dress like students, we dress like housewives or in a suit and a tie
I changed my hairstyle so many times now don’t know what I look like!
You make me shiver, I feel so tender we make a pretty good team Don’t get exhausted, I’II do some driving you ought to get you some sleep
Burned all my notebooks, what good are notebooks? They won’t help me survive My chest is aching, burns like a furnace the burning keeps me alive
"Making Flippy Floppy"
Wait a minute, to everybody get in line!
Nothing can come between us Nothing gets you down
Nothing strikes your fancy Nothing turns you on
You don’t have to wait for more instructions No one makes a monkey out of me
We lie on our backs, feet in the air Rest and relaxation, rocket to my brain
Snap into position Bounce till you ache
Step out of line And you end up in jail
Doctor Doctor We have nothing in our pockets
We continue But we have nothing left to offer
Faces pressed against the window Hey! they are just my friends
Check this out don’t be so slick Break our backs it goes like this.
We are born without eyesight We are born without sin
And our mama protects us From the cold and the rain
We’re in no hurry sugar and spice We sing in the darkness We open our eyes

Business and pleasure Lie right to your face
Divide it in sections And then give it away

Oh and on the first day, we had everything we could stand Ooh who could’ve asked for more?
And on the second day, we had nothing else left to do Ooh what a day that was, mmm wah!
Well there are 50,000 beggars roaming in the streets And they have lost all their possessions; they have nothing left to eat Down come a bolt of lightning, start an electrical storm
Starts a chain reaction, go pull a fire alarm I said that I’m dreaming of a city, it was my own invention I put the wheels in motion, a time for big decisions, ho ho
And on the first day, we had everything we could stand Ooh and then we let it fall And on the second day, there was nothing else left at all Ooh what a day that was, oh, ho
Oh a day that was Oh ho, and that’s the way it goes There’s a million ways - to get things done There’s a million ways - to make things work out.
Well I’m going right through and the light came down And they’re roundin’ ’em up from all over town, ha ha They’re movin’ forward & backwards, they're movin’ backwards & front
And they’re enjoying themselves, moving in ev’ry direction And if you feel like you’re in a whirlpool, you feel like going home You feel like talking to someone Who knows the differences between right and wrong, oh
And on the first day, we had everything we could stand Ooh and then we let it fall And on the second day, there was nothing else left at all Ooh what a day that was, oh, oh
We’re going boom boom boom, and that’s the way we live
And in a great big room, and that’s the way we live

Hi yo I got plenty of time Hi yo you got light in your eyes
And you’re standing here beside me I love the passing of time
Never for money Always for love Cover up and say goodnight say goodnight
Home - is where I want to be But I guess I’m already there I come home - she lifted up her wings Guess that this must be the place
I can’t tell one from another Did I find you, or you find me? There was a time Before we were born If someone asks, this is where I’II be where I’II be
Hi yo We drift in and out Hi yo sing into my mouth Out of all those kinds of people You got a face with a view
I’m just an animal looking for a home Share the same space for a minute or two And you love me till my heart stops Love me till I’m dead
Eyes that light up, eyes look through you Cover up the blank spots Hit me on the head Ah, ooh

Changin’ my shape I feel like an accident They’re back! To explain their experience
Isn’t it weird Sounds too obscure to me Wasting away That was their policy
I'm ready to leave I push the fact in front of me Facts lost, facts are never what they seem to be Nothing there, no information left of any kind I'm lifting my head, looking for danger signs
There was a line There was a formula
Sharp as a knife Facts cut a hole in us
I’m still waiting

The feeling returns Whenever we close out eyes Lifting my head looking around inside
The island of doubt It’s like the taste of medicine Working by hindsight Got the message from the oxygen
Ooh I’m making a list Find the cost of opportunity Doing it right, right Facts are useful in emergencies
The feeling returns Whenever we close out eyes Lifting my head Looking around inside.
Facts are simple and facts are straight Facts are lazy and facts are late Facts all come with points of view Facts don’t do what I want them to
Facts just twist the truth around Facts are living turned inside out Facts are getting the best of them

The Trinity test had been executed in New Mexico.
The people from Trinity had arrived in the Marianas and they had with them at that particular time, color photographs of the Trinity explosion, so we got the gang together
and we show them. We didn't use the words "atomic bomb",
we did not use that, but we said:
Okay now, this is the bomb,
this is what will happen when we make our flight tomorrow
and release it, this is what we're gonna see.
So, uh... with this, uh... preliminary indoctrination
we got into the airplane and took off.
Once through we're ... in the air, uh...
I then left the pilot seat of the airplane and I crawled back into the back,
where the enlisted men were.
I got them all together back, then we pour some coffee out of the thermos jug
and I told them actually what we... what we were doing,
what we are carrying at that time, and the weather being clear at our primary,
which was Hiroshima, there was no... no decision left,
I mean, we were on the way to the primary,
so that part of it was perfectly routine, as we came in, uh... from our initial point
to the bomb release point, uh... it was... again routine.
There we were bothered... not in the least by any kind of either opposition... no flag.
We didn't see anything that causes any... any concerns, so we're able to concentrate
strictly on the bombing problem.
The... bomb was released.
We executed a turn around as we had been directed.
The bomb blast hits us.
It hits us in... two different shockwaves, first being the stronger.
This... essay was a... perfectly... unexciting and routine thing up until the point of taking a look at the damage we had been done, that was kinda a... little bit hard to realize, it was kinda inconceivable as to what we were looking at there.
We pass comments back and forth in the airplane,
we took pictures and... by the time we had done that
I became concerned that we better quit be in sight seers
and get out of there. And...
we were gone and off to the coast...
in a matter of about 20 minutes from the time that the bomb was released.
We have spent more than two billion dollars on the greatest scientific gamble in history, and we have won.
The Navy Department says that it's too early yet to tell what effect the atomic bomb
will have on Japanese morale and that we may have to destroy 4 or 5 cities
before they actually believe we have such a bomb.
Having found the atomic bomb, we have used it.
We shall continue to use it
until we completely destroy
Japan's power to make war.
Only a japanese surrender will stop us.
It is an awful responsibility which has come to us.
We thank God that it has come to us instead of to our enemies, and we pray that He may guide us to use it in His ways and for His purposes.
Captain Beahan, what was your most outstanding experience
on this historic flight?
I suppose it was when the clouds don't pull out over the target, at Nagasaki, so it was pretty as a picture.
I made the run, let the bomb go.
That was my greatest thrill.
# There was no atheists in the hole #
# and men that had never prayed at all #
# at the time they watched at the heaven #
# and beg the Lord that ended up the war #
# They told Him of their mothers on the homeland #
# They told Him that they wanted to be there #
# I believe the bomb that stroke Hiroshima #
# was the answer to our boys' prayers. #
Hey, did you see that city where the first atomic bomb was dropped?
Yes, Fred. We flew over Hiroshima for about half an hour.
- It was a shamble down.
- A shamble?
It looked like Evans field after a doubleheader with the Giants.
The... group had been told to select some targets in Japan that had not been bombed.
In other words, they wanted virgin targets, and the reason behind it, even though not given to the group at that time, the reason behind it was that they wanted to be able to make bomb blast studies,
or bomb damage studies on virgin targets once the bombs were used.
There are definitely military targets, there was no question about that,
and they offered such a, uh...
Well, you can almost say a... classroom experiment,
as far as being able to determine later the bomb damage.
I have... been subjected many times to... criticism,
I have been accused of being... insane, being a drunkard, uh... being everything that... you can imagine a derelict to be, as a result of a guilty conscience for doing this, and... as I said... no one's ever comes to my defense in that regard.
I look at it this way: that my part in this thing may well have been something that later or now the U. S. government might be looking at someone with a guilt complex, and... their feeling could be that the less said about it by the United States government the better.
June 30 1946, almost time.
Another five seconds...
two...
17.30.
A spewing column of smoke
9 miles high in the sky,
blinding light stronger than the Sun.
Bikini Atholon, present site of Operation Crossroads,
and the fourth atom bomb explosion.
Bikini Atholon, where 200 warships will be anchored, 140 planes, 200 goats,
200 pigs, 4,000 rats.
How will this fourth bomb affect you?
What do you know of this atom bomb?
The bomb will not start a chain reaction in the water, converting it all the gas, letting all the ships on all the oceans drop down to the bottom.
It will not blow out the bottom of the sea and let all the water run down the hole.
It will not destroy gravity.
I am NOT an atomic playboy, as one of my critics labeled me, exploding these bombs to satisfy my personal whim.
The natives expressed to the people of the United States their welcome,
despite the fact that the Atholon of Bikini may be utterly destroyed on July 1.
But the natives, in their simplicity and their pleasantness and their courtesy,
they're more than willing to cooperate,
although they don't understand the world of nuclear energy anymore than we do,
and all they have no way of understanding what the test is all about.
Scene 26, take 2.
Well, James, tell them that the commodore will explain the atomic bomb.
All right. Now, James, will you tell them that the United States government now wants to turn this great destructive force into something good for mankind, and that this experiments here at Bikini are the first step in that direction.
Now, they have heard of our plan for their evacuation.
Will you ask King Judah to get up and tell us now what his people think, and if they're willing to go.
Yes, very good, they are willing to go and everything is in God hands.
Well, you tell them and King Judah that everything being in God's hands, it cannot be other than good.
American officials discuss plans with the Bikini natives for the evacuation of the Atholon.
The natives are nomadic groups,
and are well pleased that the yanks are going to add a little variety to their lives,
and here, by the way, you hear them singing a
Marshallese version of "You are my sunshine".
They are in time. And I just have been in the... The boys in the control seat...
The pilot have it under his control. No one can stop it, the atomic bomb is about to drop.
- 20 seconds.
- We do not how it sound...
but 42,000 men are here watching.
- All the observers...
- ten seconds!
All the observer ships in position in the open sea, were about 10 miles away.
Four... three... two... one...
In the background was the growing struggle between two great powers
to shape the post-war world:
Soviet Russia was expansively stabbing westward,
knifening the nations left empty by war.
For orders from the Kremlin,
Russia had launched one of history's most drastic
political, moral and economic wars: a cold war.
The United States was obliged to help Europe safeguard its traditional freedoms
and the independence of its nations.
Gone was the spirit of wartime unity that reached its peak on that historic afternoon
in April 45 at the Elbe River in Germany.
Here two worlds actually met, but this coalition was to be torn asunder.
Already an Iron Curtain had dropped around
Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria.
"Uh, but this is Europe", you say.
But let's see what can happen elsewhere, in the small town of Mosinee, Wisconsin.
Peaceful, isn't it?
But the red punching falls and the chief of police is hauled off to jail.
Next, public utilities are seized by fifth columnists.
Watch carefully what happens to an editor who operates under a free press.
He goes to jail too and his newspaper is confiscated. Exit freedom of thought.
Yes, this is life under the Soviet form of government.
The little town of Mosinee made this experiment for
24 hours of public service to all America.
It can't happen here?
Well, this is what it looks like if it should.
Fortunately we can move the clock back.
The time is not yet.
Let us pray that it never happens in our country.
Before we meet the members of the American Legion Post 279, who helped make this picture possible,
I just like to say that gives me a great deal of satisfaction to present two outstanding shopping centers in California,
Shopping Hub of the San Gabriel
Valley in West Arcadia and the Whittier Quad Shopping
Center in Whittier, California, because... they are concrete expressions of the practical idealism that built America.
When you visit these two fine shopping centers, you will find more than four score beautiful stores, the sparkling assortments, an attractive atmosphere, and of course plenty of free parking for all the cars that we, capitalists, seem to acquire.
Who can help but contrast the beauty of the practical settings of the Arcadia Shopping Hub or the Whittier Quad with what you'd find under communism.
It's not sane to hope for the best without preparing for the worst.
Our object is not aggression.
We need not become militaristic,
but we must keep our army, our navy, our air force at ready steam.
We must back up our team for security.
Well, I guess there's nothing for us to worry about.
We're the ones that have the bomb.
The atom bomb explodes again in the headlines of the world.
In Washington, the chairman
of the Joint Congressional Committee on
Atomic Energy, senator Brian McMahon,
gives his reaction to the Russia's possession of the bomb.
This is no time for hysteria, this is no time for panic, this is a time for a calm reflection on the political and military implications of this transcendent event.
# Everybody is worried #
# about the atomic bomb #
# but nobody's worried #
# about the day my Lord will come #
# when He hit, the Lord Almighty, like an atom bomb #
# when He comes, when He comes #
Well, this suit is made of this material.
Inside this layer is a... shredded led... that resists against atomic rays.
Okay, Richard, go with this antirray jumper.
# Everybody is worried #
# about the atomic bomb #
# but nobody's worried #
# about the day my Lord will come #
One immediate effect of the announce of the Russian atom blast
is the tight of security regulations of all atom installations.
At Hanford, Washington, where 200 million dollars
have being spent in the ever expanding atomic government empire,
the door is being locked, but tight.
The guards are get on their toes by constant targets practices,
and they have orders to shoot to kill at any suspicious thing.
A highly trained, well equipped
North Korean army
swarmed across the 38th paralell to attack unprepared South Korean defenders.
Caught off guard they were all overwhelmed,
until the United Nations took its historic vote to intervine.
The end of the war seemed in sight
as the Allies pushed north towards the
North Korean capital of Pyongyang.
Then it happened.
The Chinese Red Army starts bring
hundreds of thousands, swarmed over the frontier
against thinly held United Nations positions.
Confronted by overwhelming numbers, UN army were forced to an inevitable retreat,
while men wondered whether Red
China detach off World War Three.
Will the atom bomb be the answer to the Chinese hordes?
President Truman said that it was under consideration.
If the United Nations jilts to the forces of agression, no nation will be safe or secure.
If the agression is successful in
Korea we can expect it to spread
throughout Asia and Europe and to this hemisphere.
We are fighting in Korea for our own national security and survival.
It's time for the Longines Chronicle.
Our distinguished guest for this evening is the honorable James E. Van Zandt,
United States congressman from Pennsylvania.
It's my opinion that... we should fight the war to win... in Korea, rather than try to settle at the diplomatic table, which is impossible when you're dealing with Russia.
Would you extend your will to win so far as to include the atomic bomb?
Very definitely, Dr. Peterson.
I've always been a firm believer that we should use the atomic bomb not only on Korea, but north of the yellow river in Manchuria.
Does that mean that you believe that it could be effectively used as a weapon in the Korean theater?
Yes, I think that... there are several targets... uh... in Northern Korea... we could use, that we could destroy with the atomic bomb, we could strong contaminate them.
And then, of course, there are targets in
Manchuria that should be destroyed.
This is the destructive power we pray
God we will never be called upon
to hurt at any nation, but should if become necessary.
That it's not hesitate, because it is foreign to our nature
to use the power which has been given us.
I propose the president of the United States invite at the commander of the north korean troops to withdraw his forces beyond the 38th parallel within one week, or use that week to evacuate civilians from a specified list of North Korean cities that will be subjected to atomic attack by the United States air force.
# There will soon be uneven to this cold an wicked war #
# when those hard headed comunists had got what they're looking for #
# Only one thing that will stop then, and their outrageous fun, #
# if General MacArthur drops the atomic bomb. #
# There'll be fire clouds and metal flying all around #
# and radioactivity will burn until the ground #
# If there's any commies left in all will burn until the ground #
# if General MacArthur drops the atomic bomb. #
I ask you, the American citizen, to let your Congressman know how you feel about this proposal.
Well, I really don't know... what to do.
But do you feel the Korean situation affects us more than anything else?
Yes, I feel that we should get out our boys home, they've been over there long enough and it doesn't seem to be any end to this situation.
Hear what my mom said about how bad things are back home.
"Everybody's hoarding.
"Properties are getting fat contracts.
"Neighbors say that politicians are using the war to their own advantage.
All our chief atomic scientists are spies."
And a lot more.
I just take it with a grain of salt.
Let me tell you how the commies plant propaganda back home.
Sometime ago Mack, Johnny and I managed to get our last leave together in a big city.
We must get rid from that atom bomb!
These poor boys will shed their innocent blood
- in a war that this country is provoking!
- Get a load of us.
Asiatic people all want the peaceful establishment of native regimes without the interference of the United States troops.
Communist don't want war.
War would be world suicide.
Only communist countries can guarantee you peace!
Why don't you go live in a communist country then?
You're going to talk on a street corner there?
You look pretty well, sister, to be tearing down the country that gives you freedom of speech.
# We're living in the country that's the finest place on Earth, #
# but some folks don't appreciate this land that gave them birth #
# I hear that up in Washington they're having an awful fuss #
# 'cause communist spies are making monkeys out of us. #
The question is: have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?
You refuse to answer that question, is that correct?
I have told you that I will always... my beliefs, my affiliations and anything else to the American public, and they will know where I stand, as they do from all my writings.
- Stay away from the stand!
- I wrote of Americanism for many years, and I...
- Stay away from the stand!
- ...for the Bill of Rights you are destroying.
Stay away from the stand!
# The bureaus and departments have been busy night and day #
# They're figuring out just how we gave our secrets all away #
# and Congress has appointed a committee, so they said, #
# to find out who's American and who's a low down red #
I'm holding in my hand a microfilm, a very highly confidential secret
State Department documents.
These documents were fed out of the
State Department over ten years ago, by communists who were employees of that Department, and who were interested in seeing that these documents were sent to the Soviet Union, when the interests of the Soviet Union happened to be in conflict with those of the United States.
# I'm no communist, I tell you that right now! #
# I believe a man should own his own house and car and cow #
# I like this private ownership and I want to be left alone #
# Let the government run its business and let me run my own #
Our education is proceeding a pace as to how Russia operates and how they got the atom bomb, not by independent research, but from America, from traitors within our own ranks.
This is a special broadcast on the scene as Sing Sing prison,
where the Rosenbergs have just been executed.
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg have gone to the electric chair.
The first to go into the death chamber was Julius Rosenberg.
He walked with an impassible expression on his face.
He walked in slowly.
He was preceded by a rabine
who was singing the 23rd salm, which everyone knows very well.
He proceeded immediately over to the chair.
He didn't say a word to anyone, he didn't see to anyone.
He sat down on the chair, straps were applied,
and the first jolt of electricity was sent through his body at 20.04 of the night.
She died a lot harder.
When it appeared that she had received enough electricity to kill an ordinary person, and have received the exact amount that killed her husband, the doctors went over and pulled down the cheap... prison dress a little dark green pulled job... and place the steps... the steplescope... I can say it, place the stethoscope... to her and then looked around, looked at each other rather dumbfounded and seemed surprised that she was not dead.
Believing she was dead, the attendants had taken off the ghastly strappings and electrodes and... black belts, so far.
These had to be readjusted again, and she was given more electricity, which started again and a ghastly plume of smoke that rose from her head and went up against the skylight... overhead.
After two more of these jolts,
Ethel Rosenberg... had met her Maker.
She'll have a lot of explaining to do to.
Immediately after the execution, the corpses, the bodies were taken away.
There is nothing much to report at this particular time.
There's don't be no demonstrations.
The heat here has been extremely intense with a heavy fog in there,
and had been a bit tension about this whole proceeding up here,
but it is all over, the news men had been left first,
and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg have gone to the electric chair.
That was an on-the-spot report of the execution tonight at Sing Sing prison
of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg.
Now The Great Day Show,
as we join Red Benson and The Gang in the marine barracks in Brooklyn Navy Yard.
The program is already in fact.
The question before us is this: should the hydrogen bomb be build?
All the world knows we Americans are constructive, not destructive.
However distasteful this maybe to us, there is no choice in the matter: let us build the bomb.
Is my decided opinion that the United States of America should immediately begin the construction of the H bomb.
I feel we must make the H bomb.
Is my personal opinion that we should manufacture and produce the H bomb in quantity.
The Russians will try it anyhow, and should they learn the secret of its manufacture before we do, the life and security of all freedom loving people will be in danger.
I would like to add however that the United States of America should not necessarily use this bomb, but rather look upon it as a peaceful guardian and protector of the basic American doctrines of liberty and democracy against the obstacles of red fascisms, materialistic and atheistic philosophy.
If the communist blocK does attack,
our radar sites and observers will sound the alert.
Giant bombers will take to the air.
Jet fighters will scream aloud.
Fighters will account for some of the enemies,
but some will get through to your home.
In times of social crisis and tension,
in times when changes come so thick and fast
that the individual can no longer place himself in his group,
when he knows that something is wrong, but doesn't know what,
when he feels himself a pawn, in times like these,
most men become highly suggestible.
They listened eagerly for any voice which sounds authority.
They listen eagerly for anyone who can tell them what is wrong
and what to do right,
who can diagnose their trouble and prescribe a cure.
# Eisenhower, the man of the moment
Eisenhower, the man of the moment #
# Ike, Ike, we like Ike! #
# Ike, Ike, we want Ike! #
# We like the shine of your smile #
# We see the future in your eyes #
# You led our men to victory #
# You are the one we idolize. #
I don't mean to say, and no one can say to you, that there are no dangers.
Of course there are risks if we are not vigilant, but we do not have to be hysterical.
We can be vigilant, we can be Americans, we can stand up and hold up our heads and say:
America is the greatest force that God has ever allowed to exist on His footsdoom.
As such, it is up to us to lead this world to a peaceful and secure existence, and I assure you: we can do it.
Now, if we first take a look at the strength of America,
you and I know that is the most productive nation on Earth,
that we are richer, by any standard of comparison,
that any other nation in the world.
We know that we have great military strength, economic, intellectual.
But all in all, this total strength of America is one of those things we called,
and the world calls, unbelievable.
Now, by then, with all his strength should we be worrying at times
about what the world is doing to us?
Actually we see threats coming from all angles, the internal and external, and we wonder
what's going to happen to us individually and as a nation.
Now, perhaps I can illustrate some of the reasons for this concern of today.
Now, only a year ago the hydrogen bomb was exploded in the Pacific.
Last month, another series of it taken...
Now this transfer of power, this increase of power
from the musket and the little cannon all the way to the hydrogen bomb
in a single lifetime is indicative of the things that have happened to us.
They'd rather indicate how far
the advances of science had outrace our social conscience.
How much more we have developed scientifically than we are capable of
handling emotionally and intellectually.
So that is one of the reasons that we have this great concern,
of which the hydrogen bomb is merely a dramatic symbol.
- Dad, I finished.
- Ok, ok.
Me too. The new puzzle, where is it?
- In my bookcase.
- Thanks, daddy.
Kenny, put the news, it's about that time.
- Come on, dad.
- You can watch that show tomorrow.
- Ok.
- Thanks.
Anyone of intelligence and information is hoping and praying that we won't have
a third world war, because in this age of atomic weapons, war would be... a third world war would be a catastrophe for all mankind, and then finally, and this is quite significant, about sixty percent of the american people reviewed in the study which we made through the University of Michigan a year ago, that they believed that the military could stop the atomic bombs from falling upon the United States.
Well, I'm sorry to have to tell you that the military will tell you that today they cannot stop a successful Russian attack.
That can be corroborated rather dramatically and we didn't plan it this way, governor, but the floor manager has just handed me a bulletin saying that the Russians had just exploded a hydrogen bomb.
We must learn to live in a world where we have the hydrogen bomb and the enemy of freedom has the hydrogen bomb.
It can destroy any city, that means Fort Worth and Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, Amarillo,
El Paso, yes, Johnson City.
# Every dollar I make goes for taxes and bill #
# Perhaps they've discovered the cure for my ill #
# Ho, hai, ho, the hydrogen bomb #

# Ho, hai, ho, the hydrogen bomb #
# Oh, God, have mercy on me #
The problem this time is especially acute because this entire area of the Pacific is subject to radiological fallout, and this area is inhabited by some 20,000 people.
The meteorologists had predicted a wind condition which should had carried the fallout to the north of a group of small atollons lying to the east of Bikini.
The wind failed to follow the predictions but shifted south of that line, and the little islands of Rongelap, Rongerik and
Utirik were in the edge of the path of the fallout.
The task force commander rapidly evacuated all the people from these islands.
They were taken to the island of Kwajelin, where we maintain a naval establishment,
and there they've placed under continuous and competent medical supervision.
I visited they there last week.
Today, a whole month after the event,
the medical staff on Kwajelin have advised us that they anticipate normalness,
except, of course, diseases which may be hereafter contracted.
The 236 natives appeared to me to be well and happy.
The survey aircraft carefully searched the area and reported no shipping.
A Japanese fishing trawler appears to have been missed by the search, but based on a statement attributed to their skipper, that in effect he saw the flash of the explosion and heard the concussion six minutes later, it must have been well within the danger area.
At the time of the explosion
the tuna ship had been sailing far outside the designated safe area of a 75-mile radius.
Three hours after the H bomb had been detonated,
a downpour of radioactive ash descended on
The Fortunate Dragon and it's crew of 23.
None of them knew the nature of the deadly stole.
It was three days for before the ship and it's contaminated crew and fishing catch
sailed into port.
By that time the men suffered from beginning symptoms of deadly radiation poisoning.
By the time their illnesses have been properly diagnosed,
the hot fish brought back in their holes had been sold in the markets all over Japan.
A panic ensued.
Midnight burials of recent catches in the vicinity of the h-bomb explosion
took place all over Japan.
The bottom had dropped down the fish market,
and the Japanese people chose to do without the staple food
for a long time after the tragic affair.
Another byproduct of the stupendous mid
Pacific blast unfolds in San Francisco,
where tuna fish, supposedly made radioactive during the tests,
are scrutinized by federal agents armed with Geiger counters,
for signs of contamination.
Hot tea anyone?
That's not an invitation, it's a problem for the Coast Guard and customs
by the arrival in Brooklyn of a cargo of japanese tea slightly radioactive.
Final conclusion: the tea's radioactivity is within safety limits, not too hot to handle.
- Warm.
- Yeah. June in January that's what I say.
If you ask me, I think it's because of those atom bombs.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
They've done some cockeyed... of the world.
I think they got the south in the Equator.
Just like I keep saying... everybody's so uncertain about everything.
They don't seem to know what's gonna happen.
Bourbon, straight.
Well, as I was saying,
I wouldn't be very eager as much about the atom bomb if it were to kill you right out.
What scares me is that awful gas that deforms you.
- Yeah, that would be bad.
- Yeah.

Gentlemen, I want to welcome you to Camp Desert Rock.
This will be your last briefing before you go up out to the firing area and take part of an atomic detonation.
The tactical situation behind troop test "Smokey" is this:
the mythical enemy, which has landed on the coast of California,
has made a deep penetration close to supplys,
special weapons storage and missile launching installations
in the vicinity of Las Vegas and Hoover Dam.
The tactical commander decided at this point to use an atomic weapon
in this assault on the enemy.
The mission of these men is to move as quickly as possible into the blasted area
and exploit the breech in the enemy lines.
You are here to participate in an atomic maneuver.
This is not a hap hazard maneuver.
Careful planning for it started months back.
Watched from a safe distance,
this explosion is one of the most beautiful sights ever seen by man.
You're probably saying: So it's beautiful.
What makes it so dangerous?
Basically there are only three things to think about:
Blast,
Heat... and Radiation.
Radiation: this is the one new effect obtained by the use of an atomic weapon.
Truthfully, it's the least important of the three efects,
as far as the soldier on the ground is concerned.
You can't see radiation, feel it, smell it or taste.
Film badges and dosimeters issued to you enable the radiological safety monitor in your unit to read the amount of your exposure.
The radiation level may be high, but if you follow orders, you'll be moved out in time to avoid sickness.
Finally, if you receive enough gamma radiation to cause sterility or severe sickness, you'll be killed by blast, flying debris or heat anyway.
Well, that's the story.
Don't worry about yourselves.
As far as the test is concerned, you'll be okay.
Well, we knew now exactly where we'd be for the big show.
All we had to do is wait.
Now that it's so close it makes you feel kind of restless.
You wonder if everything's gonna turn out alright
and filled your mind no matter what you were doing.
What seems to be the trouble, soldier?
You look a little bit worried.
Well, I am, chaplain, just a little bit.
Actually there's no need to be worried as the Army has taken all of the necessary precautions to see that were perfectly safe here.
Sir, have you been on one of these shots before?
Yes, I've had the opportunity to see a number of the atomic tests.
I feel that as a chaplain, it is my responsibility to be with my men.
What's it like, chaplain?
First of all, one sees a very, very bright light, followed by a sharp wave, and then you hear the sound of the blast
and then it seems as there's a minor earthquake, and then you look up and you see the... fireball as it ascends up into the heaven.
It's a wonderful sight to behold.
30 seconds.
15 seconds.
10 seconds.
The blast shock passes in a matter of seconds
and the heat and blast effects you can see and feel.
You cannot sense the presence of nuclear radiation effects.
Alpha and beta particles, because of their low penetrating power,
are stopped by most surfaces, even a soldier skin.
They are a hazard only when materials emitting these particles
get into the body through breaks in the skin
or through the nose or mouth.
Didn't keep your mouth shut and you get a mouthful of dirt.
I got my mouth filled with dirt.
- How about the smoke and radiation?
- I Could'nt see, I could'nt see for quietest well.
Hey, young, did you wear any type of protective clothing or just what did you wear?
None, just the regular war cloth.
We see on your lapels here this white badge.
- Can you tell me what that is?
- Uh, that's a tin badge to determine or to take the amount of radiation you received in the area.
And they can tell commander if you received a lethal dose.
- That's right?
- That's right.
If you were driving from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City on US Highway 91,
you would pass through St. George, Utah,
just a short way from the Nevada
Test Site 140 miles to the west.
Ladies and gentlemen, we interrupt this program to bring you important news.
Word has just been received from the Atomic Energy Commission
that due a change in wind direction
the residue from this morning's atomic detonation
is drifting in the direction of St. George.
It is suggested that everyone remain indoors for one hour or until further notice.
There is no danger, this is simply routine
Atomic Energy Commission safety procedure.
Parents need not be alarmed about children at school.
No recesses outdoors will be permitted.
And as the people of St. George took cover,
it was natural that some of them have questions about atomic tests.
What is the atomic bomb?
Why do we have to test bombs?
A little of the amount of radiation will cause how many mutations?
Never before have so many know so little about a subject so big and so important.
The capabilities of most weapons are pretty well understood, but when it comes to atomic explosions the guessing game starts.
Alright, let's take a few minutes right now and get acquainted with the A bomb.
Mean Test Able.
A submarine bomb exploded in the harbor might affect the city.
The affected area would be a poor picnic site,
but might be able briefly to pass through quickly
with a varying degree of risk.
Risk is something the military doesn't have the monopoly.
Occupational hazards are accepted in a matter of fact manner in civilian life.
Risk is part of the pattern of daily routine.
Some of the falsehoods circulating about radiation effects are trivial but upsetting.
They've being drive to one self esteem
and will eventually result in a race of bold headed people.
Just imagine it. Imagine yourself with no hair.
They'll call you all skinhead, all cone dome.
And that's not all radioactivity will do.
It will...
Enough exposure to radiation will cause loss of hair.
The treatment, if you insist, would be symptomatic: a toupee.
But the condition would only be temporary.
Your hair would come back, same color, same quality.
Which puts the finger squarely upon one of the major fallacies
in the public attitude toward atomic weapons:
it's the fallacy of devoting eighty-five percent of one's worrying capacity
to an agent that constitutes only about fifteen percent
of an atomic bomb destroying potential,
and that's unsound, doesn't fit.
There are those few who love to maintain that there is no actual threat to the free world at all, certainly none that can justify either nuclear testing or nuclear armament.
The opposite viewpoint holds that the development of our nuclear power has been absolutely necessary protection against communist hostility and nuclear threats.
In this view, the fallout casualties, if any, will be seen as those of unidentified soldiers in the service of humanity, unknown soldiers in a war which is not started.
We're going to be talking about nuclear energy and... the kinds of things that could happen
with an atomic emergency, and... we do this not to worried you, but nor to frighten you, we really we've got admit that we live in a atomic age, so exist an atomic bomb, so we have to be aware of this, and know what to do in case an emergency happens.
If there will be a need to spend two weeks in a fallout shelter, we have had our survival kit. For the food supply packed variety of croods, soups, evaporated milk, vegetables, napkins.
The purpose of our demonstration today is to show you the actual preparation of one of the meals which was prepared in a modern day key.
One new meal consists of the following food: canned chicken, peas, dry potatoes, tomato juice.
My poster is on defenses against fallout, and if you're far outside during a nuclear explosion
decontamination may be necessary.
You have to burn or bury all your clothes and food
and afterwards you should wash thoroughly.
John, let me interrupt you here just a moment.
I have some film here that I think would describe what might happen, will describe a little about the atom, so
John, why don't you catch the lights
- and we'll try?
- Good.
# There was a turtle by the name of Burt #

Now, you and I don't have shells to crawl into like Burt the Turtle,
so we have to cover up in our own way.
Paul and Patty know this.
no matter where they go or what they do,
they always try to remember what to do if the atom bomb explodes right then.
It's a bomb! Duck and cover!
Here's Tony going to his cub scout meeting.
Tony knows the bomb can explode anytime of the year, day or night.
Duck and cover!
Atta boy Tony, that flash means "act fast".
Sundays, holidays, vacation time, we must be ready every day all the time
to do the right thing if the atomic bomb explodes.
Duck and cover!
And that's the first thing to do: duck and cover.
First you duck, then you cover.
You duck and cover.
Duck and cover under the table.
It's a bomb! Duck and cover! Duck and cover!
Duck and cover yourself.
# He did what we all must learn to do #
# you and you and you and you you and you and you and you #
# you and you and you and you #
# you and you and you and you #
- # Duck and cover #
- Remember what to do, friends.
Now tell me right out loud, what are you supposed to do when you see the flash?
Duck and cover!
- Question.
- Yes?
How far we have to be from the blast for get through it?
Well, let's take a 20 megatons surface burst.
You would have a good chance of surviving if you're more than 12 miles from the point of detonation.
A bomb equivalent to 20 million tons of TNT would cause an intense fire, called a firestorm, in an area about 2,000 square miles around the center of the blast, and in such an area it would be futile, desperately futile, to construct what are called fallout shelters.
This man, like thousands of others around the country, is suffering from a dread disease called "nucleorosis".
The symptoms: nuclear blindness.
All you can see is a mushroom cloud.
He's blinded from the fear of it,
deaf from the sound of it,
and there is a short circuit in his brain.
He can only think on the awful threath of the nuclear bomb.
We ought to learn something from the
Second War World at this respect.
And the bombing there, even by Second World War bombs, on
Hamburg, on Tokyo and on other cities, showed that such shelters became centers for incinerating or asphyxiating the people who are in them.
A fallout shelter in your basement
will give adequate shielding from radioactive fallout.
Finally getting the message.
Are you?
A new housing development near Denver,
Colorado, shows the nation's first model
homes with built in fallout shelters.
The room is designed with an atomic war in mind,
but behind each eight inch thick reinforced concrete wall
it may prove to be just what the herring housewive is looking for:
one life with the kids gets too hectic.
You don't think that shelters are deterrent to a nuclear war either?
On the contrary, I believe that psychologically they will push both us and the Russians into thinking more of having the war.
There are some instances where you may be ahead of us, for example in the... development of your... the thrust of your rockets for the investigation of outer space.
Maybe in some instances, for example the color television, we are ahead of you.
But, in order for both rise...
No, in rockets we've passed you by...
We'll show you our success in you show the actual possibilities of America, and we will be able to say: "Here are the possibilities of America".
How long does it exist? How many years? Three hundred years?
150 years of independence?
Then we will say that America exists
150 years and this is its level.
We are 42 years not quite.
Another seven years we'll be in the same level of America.
Then in the future we will go ahead and wait for you in the crossroad.
That increasing communication will teach us domething, and it will teach you some things too, because after all you don't know everything.
Yes, I don't know everything and I would say that you know absolutely nothing about communism, nothing except fear of it.
Let's say you've got your family in your shelter,
the attack is on.
A question might come up of admitting anyone over and above the number
for the home shelter was design.
I'd say we should rely on the best prudential judgment that the father,
or the one responsible for the shelter, can make under circumstances, but I say let him think twice before he admits the needy stranger if admitting the needy stranger is going to cut down the chances of survival of the group it's already there.
And then that final point:
Can a man have protective devices in order to protect his family once they are in the shelter from, let's say, strangers that try to use a crowbar to get in?
I'd say from what I have been talking about, the matter of self-defense.
It would be wise for a man to at least to way the consider the possibility of putting some protective devices in the shelter together with the other elements of the survival kit.
Alright, you've been down there eight to ten days.
You come out and you find that half or three quarters of Los Angeles has been destroyed, but how you going to continue to live?
Well, the first thing we have to recognize is that half of Los Angeles is destroyed, maybe eighty, ninety percent of the people will be dead and there will be fewer mouths to feed, and those of us who'd survive, we'll have more water and food to divide out.
# Last night I was dreaming #
# dreaming about the H bomb #
# Well, the bomb went off and I was caught #
# I was the only way on the ground #
# There were 13 women #
# And only one man in the town #
# 13 women at all and only one man in town #
# And as funny as it may be #
# The one and only man in town was me #
# Thirteen women and me the only man around. #
# I had two girls every morning #
# Seeing if I was well fed #
# And believe you me, one sweetened my tea #
- # While another one buttered my bread #
- Cheese, macaroni, instant potatoes...
# Something exploded down inside #
# and rushed tears up in my eyes #
# Oh, yes, I hava that funny feeling #
# I guess it's my atomic love for you #
Our artillery and our Tactical Air Force in the
Pacific, are now equipped, at this moment, with atomic explosives which can and will be used on military targets with precision and effectiveness.
It's just...
On the steps of the nation's Capitol the bell announces the opening
of Mental Health Week.
It's rung by Vice President Nixon, and the Senator Smathers of Florida.
Characterizing mental health as the nation's number one problem,
the Vice President says that the ringing of the bell throughout the nation
will be a reminder of suffering Americans.
# Atom bomb baby, little atom bomb #
# I want her in my wigwam #
# She's just the way I want her to be #
# They're gonna live live... live in my fallout shelter #
# It was a 50 megatons atom jump #
# Like a radioatomic bomb #
By all means provide some tranquilizers to ease the strain and monotony of life in a shelter.
A bottle of 100 should be adequate for a family of four.
Tranquilizers are not a narcotic, they're not habit formers.
And by the way, do you know exactly what your family would do if an attack came, say, at ten o'clock tomorrow morning?
It's a good question, isn't?
- There were meant, dearest.
- George.
I make a toast to my bride-to-be.
Darling.
Darling and I toast the most wonderful man in all the world.
Why, Lucy, your eyes are filled with tears.
My heart is filled with gladness.
Oh, look, the orchestra's getting ready.
Dance with me, George!
George, I wonder if we thought this too.
- I'm afraid for you, George.
- Oh, nonsense, my silly, you.
Yes, George, afraid.
- My fiancée, Luther Marshall...
- We interrupt our normal program in the interest of security and civil defense measures as requested for the United States government.
Attention, attention!
This is an official Civil Defense warning.
This is not a test.
The United States are under nuclear attack.
Take cover immediately in your nearer nuclear shelter.
Repeat: the United States are under nuclear attack.
This is an official Civil Defense broadcast.
Enemy aircrafts are over Canada
and headed this way.
The United States are under nuclear attack.
Take cover immediately in the area fall-out shelter.
We repeat: the nation is under nuclear attack.
This is an extreme emergency.
You must stay in calm.
Go to your designated shelter without delay.
This is an official Civil Defense broadcast.
This is not a test.
The United States is under nuclear attack.
Take cover immediately in the area fallout shelter.
Repeat: the United States are under nuclear attack.
Take cover immediately in your area fallout shelter.
Now children, I want that you sit down here against the wall.
That's it.
Now go get against it.
Now listen, kids:
If they'll drop an atomic bomb it may take off any second now.
Whatever happens, I'll give the signal that's all right for us to get up.
If there's any explosion, we'll wait about a minute after's all over, then we'll go upstairs and took a look at all. See if all's right to clean up.
Children, you better clean up the broken glass and all these debris.
All an all, let's say we've been very lucky around here.
Nothing to do now but... wait for orders from the authorities and relax.
# The sun goes down and leaves me sad and blue #
# The iron curtain falls on this cold war with you #
# 'Cause you won't speak and
I won't speak, that's true #
# Two stubborn people with a cold war to go through. #
# Oh why, oh why, should love ever come to couples like you and me #

[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
This movie is about groups,
Metal, guitars, girls, all that stuff
But ultimately, the movie is only half the story,
Because half the true magic is about the fans.
[SCREAMING]
The most vocal fans all the time are heavy metal fans.
They're the best.
I salute them.
[SCREAMING]
[CRADLE TO THE GRAVE
BY MOTORHEAD PLAYING]
Ain't so bad, ain't so bad
Could've been a loser
Ain't so bad, ain't so bad
Rather be a boozer
Standing at the crossroads
See where the wind blows
Following the white line
Following my nose
You've been living
On a razor's edge
Soon as you learned to shave
Make sure you live
Be a long time dead
Cradle to the grave
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
Ain't too good,
Don't look good
But it'll get worse
Don't look good,
Don't feel good
It's gonna take years
Life drives you nuts, babe
'Cause if you ain't certain
It'll kick you in the guts, babe
And leave you hurting
Don't matter up or down
Sideways, in or out
If it makes you feel good,
Do it
And then get out
You've been living
On a razor's edge
Listen to what I say
Don't spend your life
In your own bed
Cradle to the grave
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
WOMAN: What do you think kids like about metal?
I don't know. I guess they feel
They can escape from the real world.
They can, just like, be what they wanna be.
Be dumb, be cool, be crazy, whatever.
Like, they can do what they want.
WOMAN: Do you like heavy metal music?
- Yeah.
- What do you like about it?
Heavy metal was more of an evolution, unlike punk rock.
It evolved from hard rock bands
Such as Led Zeppelin, The Doors,
Uriah Heep, Black Sabbath,
Iron Butterfly, Deep Purple.
ALL: Metal!
And really, it changed so much,
Except for maybe perhaps the technical element,
But the energy is still there.
The fun is still there.
There's nothing but...
[DRUM BEATING]
A fist in your face.
And I think that's what's the great thing about metal.
That's, uh... It saved rock and roll for the '80s.
Well, I think heavy metal
Is, is the true rock and roll of the '80s.
And rock and roll was basically music
Made by people who were thinking with their crotches.
Punk was getting to be techno.
Punk was turning into disco in disguise.
It's faster and it's aggressive and it's rebellious
And their parents hate it.
Which has always been the mark of good rock and roll.
If your parents don't like it, it's good.
WOMAN: What do you think parents think about you?
Do I care?
The heavy metal bands
Just picked up on one little thing that we did.
You know, I mean we do that kind of music real well, you know,
But this is like this much of what we do.
You know, we do a whole bunch of things.
I like that spine-chilling feeling.
That get goosebumps up the spine, that... [HISSES]
Like you really got me.
[PLAYS AIR GUITAR]
It's like, it's like an orgasm, you know.
Sex and rock and roll, the American way.
WOMAN: I know that all the girls
In the audience are gonna wanna know...
Sixteen inches.
WOMAN: No! No.
Combination of all four.
We're four, four a piece.
What is a fucking rock star?
Some dude that's got more money than I do?
I got a bigger dick than all those people.
We're just fucking big.
You know what, we...
It doesn't mean anything.
- You know, I...
- We just like to party.
I mean, it doesn't matter what size your pencil is,
It's how you write your name.
[CHEERING]
WOMAN: What's a head banger?
When we first started doing this stuff...
Aye, aye, aye...
When we first started doing this stuff,
We didn't really talk about head banging.
We talked about girl banging, you know, gang banging.
Anything but head banging.
That doesn't seem very nice to do.
GIRL: Hot!
A head banger, they go out in front of the stage
And they head bang their head and...
It's cool.
I mean, that's them, that's not me.
I like to stand back and watch and see everything.
I like to scam on the chicks.
A head banger is somebody who dies for his music,
Who, who's a true rivet head, you know.
A head banger is somebody who likes thrash, nothing but.
Who doesn't accept glam in any way.
A head banger is uh, someone that drives by in their car
And goes, "Metal D, fucking metal! Can't they see?"
I think we started that.
Motörhead bangers, you see.
WOMAN: Are you into it?
Mm, not really. I'd rather get drunk and kick back.
And watch them make fools of themselves.
That's just a rock and roll reaction.
Uh...
And I think the, uh,
The actual head bangers of the '80s
Just make it a little more pronounced.
They bleed a lot more than...
I'm just the drummer,
I don't bang my head.
I beat off, man.
[DRUM BEATS]
Attention, everybody!
Attention.
Attention, you, creatures from another planet, you...
Hello, suckers!
Please be advised...
Be advised that...
Be advised that, uh...
- Give it up.
- I'm fucking up.
By your entry upon these premises...
You are consenting to be photographed and filmed,
Naked or otherwise...
You know, pictures and shit like that...
And having your ugly likeness...
And sound effects used in motion pictures...
Home porno and other purposes...
You, sick dirty dogs, you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And give us your money.
[PLAYING BORN TO BE WILD]
Get your motor runnin'
Head out on the highway
Looking for adventure
In whatever comes our way
Gonna make it happen
Take the world
In a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space
I like smoke and lightnin'
Heavy metal thunder
What we always wanted was to be
The biggest, most outrageous heavy metal band
That could possibly get together.
Gonna make it happen
Take the world
In a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space
Like a true nature's child
We were born
Born to be wild
We can climb so high
I never wanna die
Born to be wild
Born to be wild
Yeah!
LIZZY: Most people think it's, it's a glamorous life
And you just go from playing at small clubs
And the next thing you know, you're playing,
You know, the far ends of the world
There's a million bands out there.
And all these bands are playing the clubs
And they're playing them for a long time.
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
But you do get tired of the road.
Every night, you know.
Seven nights a week.
And that, that's our schedule.
Seven nights a week, playing.
It gets, it gets to the point where you kind of...
You go crazy.
And I think that's why, uh, a lot of, the rockers
Are kind of senile.
Because it happens to every...
- WOMAN: Burned out.
- Yeah.
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
Born to be wild
Yeah!
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
MAN: Lizzy Borden!
Thank you. Good night!
WOMAN: Where are you gonna go now?
What we're gonna do is fuck our brains out.
That's what we're gonna fucking do. Fuck around.
What the fuck is your beer problem, man?
LIZZY: Well, we want to be the best and the biggest.
WOMAN: What if it doesn't happen?
LIZZY: We know that we...
We had a great time trying.
- Do you know what?
- Oh-ho!
When you look at a city like Los Angeles,
Or the whole
United States in general,
You're gonna look and see there's millions of bands out there.
They look great, sound great, they're doing their own thing.
And all of a sudden, Poison...
What's Poison gonna do
That's gonna make us stick out of the crowd?
We're gonna have to...
We had an outrageous look
An outrageous sound, everything that we did was outrageous.
And all of a sudden people said,
"Wait a second."
"These guys have a great gimmick, but can they play?"
Well, they found out.
You don't sell...
Like you said, you don't sell three million records
If you can't play music.
WOMAN: Early on, did you guys ever think,
"God, we're never gonna make it?"
Before you got signed or anything?
[LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY]
Now, listen, I came...
We got off the road
And I got a place in Marina del Rey.
Now, these guys are smart.
They spent their money wisely.
And I'm the little pig that went off with the money.
You know, I'm saying, spend it all, loud, abrasive.
You know, obnoxious.
Well, needless to say,
I have no money now.
If you love what you're doing,
Whether you have enough money to buy a Lemans or...
Lemans? Or buy, or buy a cheeseburger...
WOMAN: It's a Pontiac.
Okay.
No, what I meant is...
- Well...
- What?
A Lemans?
- No, whether you buy a...
- Maserati.
The thing is, it's not the money.
It's just if, you know, if you enjoy what you doing, it's fun
Because you never think about,
"Oh, I wanna have this,
I wanna have that."
You wanna be on stage and that's the reward, you know.
If you buy a car and it's a great car,
It looks great, it runs fast,
It's great if you can handle the speed.
If you can't handle the speed, you're gonna wreck.
And I think that's the same thing with success.
If you obtain all the success and then you can't handle it,
I think it just goes to waste.
You just sort of push the boat out into the water.
- WOMAN: What'll you do?
- Threw the anchor...
- Sink or swim.
- WOMAN: Be an accountant?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Did you have jobs...
- He's good at that.
Oh, sure.
WOMAN: You look like an accountant.
Now, what happens is, um,
The four of us, look to the...
Well, the three of us
Look to the other three...
The four of us look to the other three
One being an individual...
[BOTH LAUGH]
This is where the accounting comes in.
- No...
- [CONTINUE LAUGHING]
If I wasn't having fun,
I wouldn't do it.
I'd stop most definitely.
WOMAN: Even if it meant not having the money?
I've already got the money.
That's not why we're in it.
- You're not in it for the money?
- Mm-mm.
- What are you in it for?
- Rock and roll.
I mean, I mean, I mean, if someone's gonna make money,
We wanna make it, you know, on us.
But I mean, we're a rock and roll band.
- We love what we do.
- So, you're in it for the music?
I'm in it for the money
No, I'm not... No.
[HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING]
[MAN SINGING]
WOMAN: So there was Poison, multi-million dollar band,
Out there on the street, handing out flyers?
That's what we used to do, this is how we did it actually.
We would, um...
During the day we would rehearse
And at night we'd go to clubs, you know, and hand stuff out.
We'd, you know, we'd try to look all cool and stuff
And just go, "Hey, yeah, come out and see the band."
At night we'd go back,
Throw on our jeans and be out there till 5:00 in the morning.
You know what I'm saying?
Like, trying so no one knew what we looked like then.
You know, putting all our flyers up and wallpapering it.
And along would come another band and cover it up
And then, you'd sneak back and it's a war!
Gotta promote, promote, promote, promote.
- Take out ads.
- I'm just advertising.
- What's the name of your band?
- Sex.
- Shotgun Wedding.
- Vixen.
- Terror.
- Gypsy and the Troubadour.
- Tommy Rot.
- Velocity.
- Tough.
- Tough.
- BOTH: Dirty Blonde.
- Wet Cherry.
The baddest band in the fucking universe!
- Metaldork.
- Untimely Death.
- Cryptic Slaughter!
- Jaded Lady.
I like passing out flyers
Because it's a good opening line on chicks.
'Cause you know, you can't walk up to a girl
And say,
"Um, you know what time it is?"
That ain't cool.
So you give 'em a flyer and they know you're in a band.
They know you're not a roadie.
- We don't have our flyers yet.
- Most people...
We don't have enough money to get them printed. Um...
We don't make any money off this...
MAN: Fifty percent of the girls take them.
The guys, they just throw them down.
Check this out, man, a guy gives me a flyer, right?
He gives me a flyer,
"Hey, all right, cool,
I'll be there! All right!"
"Cool, I'll come check out your band."
And he walks about 10 feet down the street
And I fucking wrinkle the shit up, throw it on the ground.
Well, we finally got our flyers.
We met a chick that, um, had a little bit of money.
We had her empty out her purse.
[HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYS]
Most of them just got out of high school
And they don't know what to do and they can't get real jobs
'Cause they don't look right for real jobs.
WOMAN: What do you do for a living?
Um, I'm a professional musician.
I work at Mrs. Fields Cookies.
Legal secretary.
I work for the
LA Unified School District.
We have a real sense of responsibility.
And we're tax payers.
And in fact, are very prominent in the business world.
We are also heavy metal rockers.
And we love it.
I don't work.
I can't stand work.
WOMAN: Um, what was the last job you had?
Uh, I've never had a job.
Is it a drag not having money? Yeah.
So, you're always hurting for money?
Uh, yeah!
Once you have money, you realize
That it's not really important.
What money gives you the opportunity to do
Is to forget about money.
I'd rather get rich at playing music than
Than get rich doing, uh, plumbing.
'Cause I don't wanna work until I'm 60
And die poor at 70.
And have a fat wife bitching at me and thirty kids.
I wanna do my own thing.
I'd like to have an apartment
Where we have carpeting on the floor.
'Cause, uh,
Mike picks his nose a lot and he has no place to put it.
Did you go to high school?
No, I dropped out seventh grade.
- How come?
- I don't know.
I just couldn't handle people telling me what to do.
Disobedient boys.
That's what we are.
WOMAN: And why are you rebellious?
Went to Catholic school for 12 years.
You know, they talk about these big famous bands
Tearing apart hotel rooms and stuff.
The only time we've ever been able to stay in a hotel room
We tore the shit out of it, but it just came natural.
I remember once when I read
Poison jumped on the glam band wagon.
[LAUGHING]
WOMAN: You don't think you did?
We built the first wheel on that freaking wagon any way.
Well second, all right,
Billy, Allison...
Men and makeup are where it's at.
Me personally, I might wear a little bit of eyeliner
To bring out my eyes because they're not that big,
But I'm not into wearing lipstick. Lipstick isn't me.
It's a turn off for me to kiss a guy that's got
Redder lipstick than I do.
You know, it's just a way of life now.
'Cause most guys, they don't know how to put it on.
They're dudes.
They're real clumsy.
It's like putting on high heals,
You're gonna fall all over the place, right.
I used to go down the corner and uh,
Hide my clothes underneath my jeans
And put on my makeup in that corner in the car,
By candle light.
And they got that certain look
That dazzles those little cutie girls.
And then they put on make up
And we're talking sizzle with these guys.
What I do is
I take tips from girls.
I'll, I'll let put my make up on, you know.
I kinda, I get into it, you know.
Kinda turns me on a little.
I'm, I'm not into that personally
But you know, if it sells our albums and records, yes.
You know, if a guy came to pick me up
For a baseball game or something and was wearing makeup
I probably wouldn't answer the door.
I don't like it. I like a man that looks like a man.
Do people look at you a lot?
Yeah, well, that's the idea.
It, it brings out bi-sexual tendencies
Because, women do like women no matter what people say.
My ma used to think
I was a transvestite, you know?
She'd, uh, check in there, you know,
Make sure I was not wearing her clothes and as such...
My mom still thinks I'm going through a phase in my life.
And that she says,
"Why don't you come home"
"And cut your hair, you know,"
"Like the little boy
I used to know."
WOMAN: What do you think about the pretty rock and roll stars?
Good luck to them if they're pretty, wish I was.
We've never gone out and put lipstick on
And stuff like that and put hair spray
So it looks like a truck blowing past us going 90, you know.
It's the theatrical effect.
I guess it's cool.
It's when they wear it off stage and try and pat you on the ass,
It worries me.
You know, sometimes it worries me.
I've had a lot of guys whistle at me thinking I was a chick...
When I see a it's a guy, I go back to the 18 year old girl.
If I'm driving in my car and somebody
Is at the back of me, you know, honking at me...
Sometimes I like to, you know, freak them out
You know, kinda give them a little wave
And then they come by and see me and I'm just like, yeah...
I just do a double twist, but then I make sure I keep walking.
The older we get, the uglier we get,
The more makeup we got to put on, you know what I'm saying?
It gets worse,
It doesn't get any better.
[STEVE SINGING]
Dude look like a lady...
All you girls out there, I want you to show us your breasts.
Hello, Cathouse.
WOMAN: So, tell me about
Cathouse, Rikki?
There's more girls here than anywhere in the world.
And we play rock 'n' roll, all we do...
Now we don't like add in,
Some clubs will play a little bit
Of rock 'n' roll we play only rock 'n' roll.
And it's just a real big fun, sleazy place.
Cathouse, welcome home,
They left a while ago, now they're fucking rock stars,
Faster Pussycats!
[FASTER PUSSYCATS
PLAYING CATHOUSE]
Let's go across the tracks
Where pussy ain't no feline
Rev up my Chevy
I'm gonna pay to play
Baby Lickity-split
I like that taste
I push ahead
And I fall behind
I'm just a good Good Tom
I just wanna stay
Just got back from the best cathouse in town
I had the best piece
Of Mona Lisa I ever found
And I'm going back to the best cathouse in town
WOMAN: So, why do you guys come to Cathouse?
It fucking rocks bitches...
Rock, heavy metal...
Party, drinks...
Faster Pussycats,
Guns 'N' Roses, LA.
It's what American rock 'n' roll is all about.
You want to know what rock 'n' roll is about
Come to the Cathouse.
'Cause rock 'n' roll is about a lot more than just music.
It's more than music, it's just an attitude, you know.
Me and my room mate
Needed a place where we could, uh,
Have a party and not worry about the neighbors
And getting free drinks
And a place where we can meet strippers.
WOMAN: So, could you call this place a pickup joint?
Definitely, that's, that's,
That's one of the main reasons it was opened up.
Where do you think
I found his ass, huh, Cathouse.
WOMAN: Describe some of the girls that come in here?
I like the girls that come in here.
Lot of blond girls come here, lot of girls that are
Look like they've come out of
Russ Meyers films.
They don't wear much clothes at the Cathouse.
We have this policy of never really keeping
The air conditioning on.
So, it gets really hot, so it's like...
They show a lot of flesh here.
WOMAN: I mean, I've seen girls walking around
In garter belts and bras.
I know, I like that.
Somebody came here once from Texas and they go,
"I don't believe it!"
"In Texas, we wear our lingerie in the bedroom."
"In the Cathouse they wear them out in the club."
You know, if you want to come here dressed really nice
That's okay, but...
You'll get in the club faster if you dress sleazy.
Let's go to the house
Where business is a pleasure
And as long as there's
A virgin
I won't go away
Now I'm a hard
Hard act to swallow
And she's my buried treasure
It'll be a long
Long time before I'm on my way
Just got back from the best cathouse in town
I had the best piece
Of Mona Lisa I ever found
And I'm going back to the best cathouse in town
WOMAN: So, who else comes here?
Aerosmith, Mötley Crüe,
Faster Pussycat of course.
KISS has been here a couple of times.
David Lee Roth was here last week.
WOMAN: So, what did you guys do to get signed?
- Like flyers?
- TAIME: Flyers.
We plastered them on the cars.
Plastered them on homes.
Stuffed them in their face.
They threw them down,
- we picked them up...
- Yeah, it sucked.
Give them to people that throw them down.
- Then you beat them up.
- Yeah and we kicked their ass...
WOMAN: What else did you do to try to get signed?
We tried to get Brent to blow the A&R department at the...
But it didn't work.
WOMAN: So, why are there
Like so many sexual references in your songs?
Because, Taime is a sexual monster.
- He's a dynamo.
- He is a sexual dynamo.
I'm a love machine.
WOMAN: So, how come you guys are so obsessed with sex?
- 'Cause we're young.
- We used, we used to be obsessed
With money, but we never got any so we had to like...
Give up on that.
WOMAN: What about drugs?
You use drugs?
- Uh, no.
- Alcohol.
- Aspirin, shit like that...
- Aspirin, Advil.
WOMAN: So what makes your band different than the rest
Of the bands around?
Tell me that?
Because we all have very large penises.
And we don't wipe our butt so it smells really bad.
WOMAN: So why are you in rock 'n' roll?
I'm just doing this till I can be
A manager at McDonald's or something.
I'm just, I'm just purely lazy, that's why I do this.
- Are you making a lot of money?
- No.
- No.
- People, people on the road go,
"Give me your scarf, give me your hat."
Nobody ever gives me any money.
Give me your jewelery.
We get a $1,000 a night a show
At an average we play four shows a week,
It cost us $2,500 to be on the road.
WOMAN: So at this point...
We don't make any money...
We just love doing it.
You know, not until,
We're new.
[FASTER PUSSYCATS PLAYING
BATHROOM WALLS]
Saw your number written
On the wall
Said for a good time call
Call 555-7688
Hey, baby, I can't wait
I got your number off
The bathroom wall
WOMAN: You just got back from a European tour.
- What was that like?
- I was in a room with Taime.
I mean, the rooms in Europe are really small.
The beds are right next to each other.
And all the girls that you bring in, like, had
- Crazy stuff.
- Had great fucking hairy arms...
More than me.
They'd like, hit me in the nose while I was asleep.
It was really gross.
WOMAN: You mean, he brings girls
And have sex when you're in the room?
We got, we, we only got three rooms.
You know, we gotta share.
And I had no choice
To put another dime
In the telephone,
'Cause that bitch is alone at home
I got your number off the bathroom wall
We got your number off the bathroom wall
And I decided it was about time
I made the call
We played in San Francisco
And we got pelted with rocks and garbage.
Taime broke someone's nose with a fucking mic stand.
- Well, they were mean.
- Boom!
They were throwing rocks at us and stuff, and...
WOMAN: What does it feel like when they don't like you?
Oh, we shove it in their face and tell them to eat shit.
'Cause if they don't like it, tough luck, you know.
- Eat a bag of shit.
- Eat a full bag of shit, buddy.
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
[SONG ENDS]
WOMAN: You are the definitive hard rock band
That really set the standards.
How do you feel about that?
I love it. I think, you know, we took it to the mountain
And it's still there.
It's rhythm and blues, it's twos and fours,
It's fucking, you know.
You can really fuck to a good Aerosmith song.
It's R&B. It's those twos and fours. It's...
[SCATTING]
- JOE: It's the swing.
- It's the swing.
It's the jazz of it all.
WOMAN: Did you look at The Dolls and say,
"Gee, they've got a good look.
We should look like that"?
Oh, yeah. I mean, I was in awe.
I loved it.
David Johansen had at least a thousand Mick Jagger lookalikes
And had lips for miles.
I mean, that guy could swallow the earth.
And has.
WOMAN: Did you try to make a comeback to make money?
- 'Cause you were running out.
- Shit, yes. Undoubtedly.
Yeah?
Well, you know, we not in...
I mean, you gotta
Buy your guitar strings somewhere, you know.
- Are you making a lot of money?
- Yeah.
WOMAN: Have you made a lot of money in your day?
Yeah. Yeah. Millions.
- You have?
- Oh, yeah.
- Where's it now?
- Went up my nose.
I must have snorted up all of Peru.
To survive the '60 and the '70s, it's like a fucking miracle.
WOMAN: You think you could have been dead?
Oh, God, I was several times.
We've used drugs for so many years,
It's like, you know, you burn out the punch card you know.
I mean, you've only got so many drinks in your life.
I think I used all of mine in 35 years, you know.
I was looking forward to having
A few sips on the porch when I get older,
But it ain't, it ain't in the cards, you know.
Joe and I are the toxic twins, baby.
- No one has been that, uh...
- Are you proud of it?
Uh, no.
You know, uh, no one...
Yes, I went through it, but no, not all people...
You know, they might think that that's the way to do it,
You know, and that isn't the way.
That's not the way at all.
Because we painted ourselves into a major corner.
Yeah, we figured it was the only thing to do,
Is to clean up, you know.
- How long has that been?
- It's been 11 months now.
And how do you feel?
Oh, still hung over a little bit.
No, we're doing good.
We were feeling sick and tired of feeling sick and tired.
WOMAN: Do you feel now that you can still do it without drugs?
Positively better, too.
Keep it up longer.
It's like, you know, it's like jerking off.
When you're a young kid
And you first learn how to use that thing,
You know, you go...
[SPUTTERING]
But the older you get, the slow... You slow down, you know.
You get into the rhythm of it.
And you learn how to milk it for all it's worth.
And I think that's what Aerosmith...
That's where Aerosmith is right now.
I think we could do a good job of, of fucking.
WOMAN: Okay.
Um, how do you feel about
Other bands ripping you off?
I don't know if they rip us off.
I mean, I can't hear anybody that sounds like us.
WOMAN: Don't you hear the bands?
Yeah. Yeah, I hear them,
But I don't that, I don't hear that much Aerosmith
As other people do. Aerosmith, to me, is really definitive.
Maybe some of the attitude some of the bands have.
Which is cool.
We stole it from other people.
It's almost like Tyler said one time. You know what I mean?
He said that... He said,
"With rock and roll..."
He goes, "In history, you know, everyone's doing something"
"Someone else already did.
So you're repeating yourself."
"But you're doing it with your own style."
WOMAN: Do you get mad if a band copies your style?
No. Good luck to them.
Maybe they'll do something that we can copy later.
I can think of a few that
I would like to have about now.
Right about here.
To be perfectly honest, nobody's original.
Nobody's original out there.
We're all thieves.
Some of them are just pure plagiarists.
I won't mention any names.
Their initials start with...
[BUZZER BEEPS]
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
And it's nice to know that you made some mark on music.
KISS supported Black Sabbath in the early '70s
And it was the first time
I ever really saw
A magnificent stage production with theatrics.
I mean, how incredible!
They were the... They were the forerunners of today, you know.
I think it is very important to be an innovator.
And since we were the first to do any of this,
It's, it's fun to still be doing it.
As far as I'm concerned, still doing it better
Than any of the bands that are copying us.
WOMAN: Why do you put
Those scarves on your microphone stand?
So I can wipe my nose.
Blow my nose.
WOMAN: What do you think when you see guys
Putting scarves all over their microphone stands?
- I don't know.
- Steve should get a royalty.
- Why is that?
- He was doing it a long time ago
I mean, if I write something,
I get a royalty for it
If someone else uses it.
Sorry, Steven.
Yeah!
WOMAN: So, Bobby, what do you have
To say to people who might think
That maybe your music isn't totally original?
His brothers...
[ALL LAUGH]
There's more bands in LA
Than there are anywhere else in the world
Because most of the record companies and labels
And high management corporations are based in Los Angeles.
A lot of the people who are... who play in bands
Aren't originally from Los Angeles.
Good evening.
We're Seduce from Detroit.
[HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING]
It's like, playing and driving sort of goes hand in hand.
You know, you do a five grand launch from a dead stop.
Same thing as when you walk out in front of a crowd
And everybody's like...
[IMITATES CROWD]
You know?
Same blast, you know?
It's just a rush of adrenaline.
WOMAN: Are you doing it for the money?
No. If I was in it for the money,
I would have left a long time ago.
- You know?
- Are you in it for the fame?
That would be nice.
But you know, it's just like something, uh...
I do... I enjoy doing it.
You know, it's like...
WOMAN: Are you in it for the chicks?
No, at first I might have thought it'd been like that,
But then, you realize that
Half the chicks that are gonna be out there,
That you're gonna be with,
Aren't worth the time anyway, you know.
Well, she wanted to get married,
She wanted me to have the nine to five lifestyle.
The marry, go normal, kinda, you know...
If you're gonna bump into some chick
And you just pull into town and she's gonna fuck you,
You know she's fucked everybody else
From this star on down, so what's the point?
I mean, that's pretty much conquered ground, you know.
[PLAYING HEAVY METAL MUSIC]
You go hungry, you go broke...
But if you believe in yourself,
You'll fucking make it, you know.
WOMAN: Where do you see yourself in 10 years?
Retired.
Living some place nice.
My stocks working for me, investments, bonds, securities.
You know, shit like that.
I'm responsible.
I got long hair, but fuck,
I'm a businessman, you know.
Yes, I've devoted all my life to rock and roll.
WOMAN: Does that ever get scary for you?
Yeah, 'cause I wonder sometimes
If I, uh, if I wind up 45 years old
And I never did anything or something like that...
WOMAN: Why do people devote their
Whole lives to rock and roll?
Well, if you want to become famous,
It usually takes your whole life to get there, you know?
I mean, to keep on going and going and going,
It's like, "You're almost there, you're almost there",
And then it's like, "Oh, no!"
Crash Landing, it's about us.
We, we wrote this music for it
And I was thinking about an idea for the song.
And there was a plane crash and, uh,
We just thought about, you know,
It'd be kind of neat to write the song about that.
And what it would be like if you were the pilot of the plane
And like, what you'd be going through
As you're, you know, getting ready to crash.
[BAND PLAYING CRASH LANDING]
Flying high up in the sky
Who understands
The reasons why
That I
I was lost
Tried to find my way back home
Suddenly I'm all alone
In the night
In the night
My engines started shutting down
My tail starts spinning
Round and round
Total loss of all control
Terror grips, grips my soul
I'm headed straight,
Straight for the ground!
Crash landing
WOMAN: Have you said,
"I feel like quitting,"
"'cause we haven't made it yet?"
Uh, probably every day
I say that.
I'm busting my balls at this.
Of course I wanna make it, you know.
I mean, you know, whatever it takes, man.
Last drop of blood, you know.
'Cause I'm in it, you know, till the death or whatever.
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
WOMAN: Who's the biggest band in Detroit?
Us.
WOMAN: Why did you get into
Rock and roll in the beginning?
'Cause I noticed you got lots of girls.
Girls. All sizes, all shapes.
Big, small, short, tall.
[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
Hallelujah!
Jesus Christ, when we toured with KISS,
They were like, like monsters, man.
There were lines of chicks
Outside their rooms every night, you know.
What the...
What's the matter with me?
I'm trying to pull the stragglers, you know.
WOMAN: Talk to me a little bit about
The girls that approach you.
- Oh...
- Where'd you hear that?
Why, did somebody say something?
[ALL LAUGH]
WOMAN: What do you think about groupies?
I love them!
- Amazing.
- They're great.
Just amazing.
You know how I mean.
They keep a young man hard.
It's a way of life, you know.
STEVEN: It's like your alter ego.
They're doing the same thing you are.
I mean, you're in a band and you love it.
You love the music that you're playing.
Uh, you know, you see them freaking out and loving it.
It's just, you know, it just reinforces the way you feel.
In the '60s they used to call them groupies.
I like to call them the fleas and ticks of rock and roll.
That's, that's my motto.
The, the best groupies are in Salt Lake City.
And, uh, I've had four of them at a time.
WOMAN: So you, you get into group sex?
- Uh...
- Yeah, it's happened.
It's happened.
We've had four or five since we've been here.
WOMAN: How long have you been here?
- Five weeks.
- Five weeks.
WOMAN: Do you often see girls take off
Their shirts at your concerts?
Yeah. It's, uh, it's our form of salute.
We go, "Hello."
And they go, "Hello."
Leads me to an interesting story.
One day, I was in my hotel room
And Bret's room was next to mine.
And I heard this girl screaming and pounding on the door.
This girl with really long hair, sitting...
Sitting in a bus, by the side of us.
And we don't know her.
Suddenly she goes bang and falls on the floor...
So she says, "I'll only stay a while." All right.
So we become fast friends, we swap spit...
He gets her by the legs and I get her by the shoulders.
I get her by her shoulders...
I get so far up with her and she starts wobbling and scre...
I thought, "What's the matter with her?"
I finally got out of bed and I said,"To hell with this!
"I'm gonna go, go do something about it."
I walk outside, the door...
His door opens and the girl comes running out.
So I don't know how to get rid of this girl.
She says,
"What do you want of me?"
And I suddenly realize
I had my foot on her hair.
She was there for 15 minutes trying to get out of his room.
I said, "Go up to the 23rd floor where the, uh, road crew is"
"And take care of them."
She was having an epileptic fit,
I'm like, "My God!"
[SPASMING]
If I woke up and looked at me in the morning,
I'd be screaming, "Dude, you get outta here."
And I don't know what happened,
But the next day the road crew was very friendly.
WOMAN: Have you ever said to yourself,
"I could fall in love with this groupie"?
[GIRL GIGGLES]
Have I ever...
Have you ever said to yourself,
"I could fall in love with this groupie"? Yeah.
Probably not because I'd have to think that
Somebody in every band had also.
Paul Stanley said one time that if you're gonna make it
And be successful, you gotta get rid of your women.
If this is the way you wanna live,
Then you can live like this.
WOMAN: And we can safely say that,
Since this is a documentary film,
That you actually do live like this?
As often as I can.
Guys in the metal scene are, are fun.
And you can take advantage of them
Just as guys can take advantage of the girls in the metal scene.
You know what I'm saying?
In heavy metal music, women are portrayed to be abused.
Um, they're kind of, uh, being bound in chains.
Many of the styles portray them as having handcuffs on,
Leg irons, being locked in cages.
There's a very brutal aspect
Towards the woman in heavy metal.
'Cause it very much appeals to the male macho image.
I don't think people take girls seriously in this sort of music.
I don't know why that is.
'Cause there hasn't been anybody to prove
That girls can really, really rock.
WOMAN: Can girls play rock and roll as good as guys?
- You bet.
- Damn right, we can.
Shit.
We rock. We kick ass.
WOMAN: You get a lot of chicks from being in a band?
Oh, fuck, you get all the chicks from being in a band.
Especially the singer.
I get the most.
Well, that's fine.
That's a stereotype.
The minute a girl goes out with a bunch of guys, she's a slut.
- What's your favorite past time?
- Sex.
Rock and roll and sex.
Girls. Girls.
Favorite past time.
Big tittied.
What's your favorite past time?
- Sex.
- Definitely.
All the time.
Every day, at least three or four times.
WOMAN: What kind of guys do you like?
Um, musicians, unfortunately.
WOMAN: Why?
Because they're irresponsible assholes, but they look good.
When I'm playing, they seem so mesmerized
By what I'm doing on stage.
Instantly, they're mine, you know.
They have attitude.
I know that sounds kind of weird, but I like attitude.
My personal taste?
I like sluts.
I like slutty girls.
I like girls that will take off all their clothes
Right in front of me and dance in my face.
That turns me on.
WOMAN: Does this happen a lot, Matthew?
Yeah. It's a rock and roll band.
I mean, uh...
It's all a combination.
It's great to fell that hair above you, you know.
Falling down.
WOMAN: So, when you're on stage you're wearing the hair...
No, in bed.
- Or on the floor or the kitchen.
- The bathroom, on the table.
WOMAN: Are you afraid of getting AIDS?
I never really thought about it.
You can't screw someone now, and think,
"I just laid that chick."
Because she's gonna go,
"Honey, you're dead." You know?
You know, I, I myself,
I go with girls
Whose step-dads are gynecologists.
So that really helps out a lot.
- With the AIDS problem?
- Yeah. Yeah, a lot of that.
WOMAN: And birth control?
Um, I don't really worry about that.
WOMAN: A lot of girls chase after you?
Yes, they do.
You chicks take care of me a lot.
Why, I just had this chick sow up my pants today or else
You guys could see my dick hanging out the bottom here.
WOMAN: She didn't do a very good job dude.
If it's not money,
It's taking us here, taking us there.
- You know,
- Buying us new clothes...
- and boots.
- Yeah, got some new pants.
It's kind of a rule that, chicks don't get in the house
Unless they have a sack of groceries with them.
You know?
Yeah, let me tell you, when your stomach's growling,
You haven't had anything for a couple of days, you don't...
All of a sudden, your moral values just sorta like...
Okay, hon, if you want to pay for dinner.
That's fine with me.
WOMAN: You know a lot of guys in this scene
Let girls take care of them financially.
What do you thing about that?
I think that's sad.
Sounds horrible.
In a sense it's a form of prostitution.
WOMAN: Would you ever go out with a girl just so that, you know
She would pay for some food even if you didn't like her.
Um, yeah.
- Yeah, I would.
- WOMAN: Isn't that prostitution?
Uh, no, I wouldn't see it that way.
- No.
- I wouldn't see it that way. No.
WOMAN: Would you let some guy pay for you?
No.
WOMAN: What are you going to do for them?
Anything they want right now that I can do.
WOMAN: What do you do for them?
You know, when I have a little money
I'll be them the nice things some pretty furs...
And the, the cars and the Rolls Royces.
And the whole, the whole shebang.
- You're gonna remember them?
- Oh, yeah!
WOMAN: How long have London been together?
- Too fucking long. Since 1979.
- Uh-huh.
Yeah, well, this is like
The uh, training school for rock stars.
'Cause see we get somebody in the band
And uh, as soon as they leave they become rock stars.
WOMAN: So, who else was in your band?
Couple of dudes from
Guns N' Roses.
A dude from, uh, W.A.S.P.
And, uh, Nikki Sixx from Mötley Crüe.
Freddy Coury of Cinderella.
Well, I like to tell you that, uh,
We do appreciate you guys being here
And we would like to have you're co-operation
To make us look bitching.
All right!
You see, we've been in this town for so long
That we're like a cheap hooker on the street.
Nobody wants to know about us.
So, what happens is we, we have a big following out of town,
We come back here, they offer us 50 bucks
To play the Troubadour or whatever.
- On a Tuesday.
- On a Tuesday.
But, we will do it for a bar tab.
So, you guys are gonna be in the picture right here, so...
If you can just like...
Stick your hands up in the air and make yourselves look...
Show us your under-alls.
All right!
Oh! You want to hear about Arizona.
Well, I just found out when
I was in my hotel room that,
That, that oral sex was illegal.
- Now that fucking...
- By three years.
That fucking bummed me out.
He loves to eat pussy.
Can you imagine.
You're under arrest for...
Now, come on.
We were rather shocked to hear that really.
Yeah, but unfortunately we did break the law
An awful lot when we were in Arizona.
Girls in other cities are great
Because uh, it's always two or three
That are totally loaded with money.
Here's what London is...
Our dicks get real hard for gold cards.
They do. They do.
No.
You guys are fucking losing it, man.
You're not here for me.
You're here for you know what.
Women make you feel very, very good
When they're out in front of you and they just start fucking
Sucking their own hands and sucking their own fingers
And throwing notes at you and taking their tops off.
Oh, my God!
Not more fog.
First of all, girls like it when you talk dirty to them.
Especially right here.
Okay. You just tell them you want to bang them...
Kiss their toes, lift their butt up in the air
And you look at her with the lights...
We are not role models for your life.
My hands are tied
My back's to the wall
Nowhere to hide
No escape from it all, yeah
Pick of the town
Living in the fast lane
Running around
Well, they need those money skies, yeah
Times I like new love
There's a place to go
And I went with this chick.
Well, this chick is all weird.
She was using these cuffs
And there was nowhere to cuff me up.
And she wanted to cuff me up.
And all there was, was a desk with handles.
So she used the handle of a fucking drawer.
WOMAN: Why did she wanna cuff you up?
Because she wanted to sit there and play with herself.
- Okay?
- With you cuffed to the desk?
Yeah. Shit, I loved it.
Anyway, she left me there.
I fell asleep.
And I'm like this.
Ooh, breakout!
Hey!
WOMAN: When was the last time you had a job?
Eight years ago. [LAUGHING]
We don't work, this is...
We play music.
Well, I've never had a job.
The girls have always,
The girls have always been very generous.
Well, I'm currently like,
I'm still employed.
I'm a professional gynecologist.
WOMAN: No, when was the last time you had a job.
Well, uh, this is my job.
Uh, as far as I'm concerned this is what I do.
I believe in it, you know, this is rock 'n' roll. I do this.
So, I mean,
I don't consider that, uh,
I'm like, lazy or something
'cause I don't do a job.
Because I bust my fucking ass doing rock and roll.
WOMAN: Do you always have money?
Sometimes we do and sometimes we don't.
We're, we're in debt for 100 grand.
Right now, yes, we are.
But we're getting out of that.
WOMAN: How could you be in debt for 100 grand?
We bought a lot of equipment.
Our last album we did was financed by this guy
Who was in jail, right?
[LAUGHING]
Yeah, but...
He's out now.
And now he wants his money.
All right. See this?
You know, that bullshit going on out there
For the fucking Russians, huh?
I'm sick of listening to these motherfuckers.
[DRUM ROLL]
You know, how they say
The Russians are coming over here.
They cause shit.
Ha ha, surprise.
Uh oh, this fucker's tough.
MAN: Burn it.
Come on, mother fucker.
I ain't got all day.
This song is for the Russians.
This is called Russian Winter.
[SCREAMING]
Yeah!
We were making flame pots for this song, Russian Winter.
And what we did was, we uh,
Wanted big flames, so we put
A lot of extra gun powder and flash powder together.
So, we basically got your uh, standard concussion bombs.
- Yeah.
- Six at once.
Snow bound, snow bound,
Just like a Russian winter
Yeah!
- Hell bound
- Hell bound
Beware of the Russian winter
In the USA
That's why it's snowing in America.
Oh and when your eyes are dim
You know the beast crawls in
To make you suffer
Again and again
I left for Chicago, so called to do business.
I went and did nothing.
This cop was sending us...
Douche bag. I mean, this guy was an idiot.
Anyway...
I get in to get to the car and he goes, "Get out of here!"
"Come on, get your ass out of here."
And I go, "Fuck you!"
- To the cop.
- Oh, yeah!
He was a fucking...
If you would have seen this guy, this is not an alley cop.
Alley cops, they look good and they look big
And they look nuts and they're young
And pissed off and they are ready to kick ass.
And I'm sitting in the cab with the door open
And he grabs me by the hair.
And that was it.
I go, motherfucker, is this anything to grip,
I can't you know...
WOMAN: What happened, let me see your eye.
So he hit me in the eye.
Right here, but it's cool,
I whacked him about six times.
And then,
I got my ass kicked after that.
- Snow bound
- Snow bound
Just like a Russian winter
Yeah!
- Hell bound
- Hell bound
Just like a Russian winter
- Snow bound
- Snow bound
Just like a Russian winter
Yeah!
- Hell bound
- Hell bound
WOMAN: Where do you guys live?
- Well, uh...
- You mean right now?
Right now,
I don't have a steady home. No.
- WOMAN: Okay.
- We're kinda on the road
- Kinda in transit right now.
- We're strollers.
'Cause I wanted to shoot you,
I wanted to go
To one of your homes.
But you didn't have one.
Yeah, that's a problem for us.
It's usually a restaurant or a bar.
Yeah, sure we'll be there.
We show up and we're decked out and good to go.
And you'll never know what happened.
Where did they go?
WOMAN: Do you think about yourselves as rock stars?
BOTH: No.
WOMAN: What's it like being a living legend?
Kids out there think, you got a guitar,
You make a hit record
And you make millions of dollars and
You just live happily ever after.
It isn't that way at all.
It's like, very hard work.
Very hard break.
You get your rewards and, and, and things...
You do get a lot of things like, gold disk, platinum disk,
Cars, houses and...
You know, then you got things like divorces,
Management ripoffs, fatigue, drugs, alcohol.
You know, hang overs and you got to go on the next one
You've been up all night burning you bridges
And you got to go, "Hi, guys."
"It's good to be back on stage again."
You know, you'll be feeling like crap inside, you know?
Very often I ask them what do they think I would be doing
If I wasn't into rock 'n' roll.
And I, I keep saying, you know,
My answer for that is
I'd probably be in prison.
Why is that?
Because I just want... I didn't want to get a regular job.
I couldn't conform to any system
And I didn't want to get a job...
I've had several jobs in factories
And, you know, different jobs.
But rock and roll has got this sort of a...
An outlaw-ish thing with it.
You can do what you wanna.
You don't have to get up
And listen to some big, fat baldy old fart
Telling you to take this box and stick it over there.
WOMAN: So, tell me about, you know, what happened
When all of a sudden you got rich
And you could buy the...
Everything you wanted.
What happened, it didn't work out exactly like Cinderella.
We started to think we were thugs.
All went out and bought fast cars and everything.
We had a manager and that's because...
Because we came from the back streets of Birmingham,
We didn't have any...
Much of a business education.
We let him con us as it was...
We got ripped off for lots of money in the early days.
But we didn't care.
We were staying in America,
Having fun, screwing as many groupies as we could,
Smoking as much dope,
Getting just, you know, out of it in general.
Basically having a good time.
Those were the fun years because we...
Until we suddenly realized on day,
"Hey, we must be earning a lot more"
"Than this guy's actually giving us."
WOMAN: So, it's not all a pretty story?
It's hard bloody work and you gotta be a businessman.
And I'm not a businessman, you know.
And I'm very fortunate to this day.
Now my wife is my manager.
She knows the business.
While I, I don't know the business side of rock and roll.
I don't wanna know it either.
When we came to America
We thought like, the drugs and all that
Was just a part of the gig, you know.
You know, you just get stoned and just get fucked up
And make your gig and all that.
And what happened with Black Sabbath?
We all ended up junkies and alcoholics and everything.
Like, the drummer ended up in a rehabilitation center.
I did for a while and...
And in the end disaster happens.
It's uh, it's inevitable for having disasters.
'Cause it's like drugs, they're okay at that time,
But we outgrew them, you know.
We just... You know, we took LSD, we took cocaine,
We took vast amounts of marijuana.
It is fun at the time, but then it became all just sort of...
"This isn't a very good idea anymore."
WOMAN: So you have a more stable life now?
- No.
- [BOTH LAUGH]
Back in Control is an organization
That is designed to
Show parents how to regain control of their child's behavior.
- Right there, sir.
- Okay, turn around.
- Turn around.
- Go ahead, feel me up.
What do you want me to do?
Bend over?
One of the things that we have found
Which we call "De-metalling",
Is a program that actually gets the kid out of heavy metal.
- [ROCK MUSIC PAYING]
- Wait a minute.
DARLYNE: We have certain rules.
Removal of heavy metal albums or tapes,
Um, not allowing the child to dress in any style
Of heavy metal, which would mean
Taking these kinds of things away from him.
Not allowing him to wear the heavy metal t-shirts
That depict the band members
With pictures of monsters or skeletons
Or whatever, graves, on them.
Hurry up, hurry up.
Come, come, come on.
This right here, just covers the forearm
And again, it's just used as a garment.
But it basically talks about an image related to heavy metal,
Which is one of power.
Come on! Oh, dude,
I gotta go.
Cup the hands, cup the hands.
Cup your hands.
This also is worn over the forearm.
And this was homemade.
As you can tell, it has
Just screws and nuts in it, a piece of sheet metal.
MAN: I used to be drunk.
I used to have lighters...
MAN 2: She's not a druggie.
She's clean.
This right here is a collar that is worn around the neck.
And also to prevent any kind of choke hold
If you get involved in a riot
And the police are trying to to get...
Contain the, uh, situation.
- Spread your legs, come on.
- Come on!
For youngsters on probation, under probation supervision,
Oftentimes this will constitute a weapon.
And they are not allowed to wear this.
WOMAN: Have you heard of people getting hurt with these things?
Oh, yes.
Check my ass as much as you want.
[SCREAMING]
The devil horns.
Black Sabbath, yeah!
Many kids, if you ask them,
They'll say,
"Well, that mean heavy metal."
It looks like two pingers poking up.
- It's kinda like a horn.
- You know how to do that?
No, like this.
No, like this.
It's the two fingers up
To represent the authority of the devil.
People would go, yeah, yeah, yeah...
I don't know, it's the sign of evil I guess.
Or it could be the sign of Satan according to the Jesus crispies,
Outside the arena with their big Jesus posters.
The three fingers down
To represent the denial of the trinity.
This is Satan's head and this is his horns
And if you do this, you're absolutely possessed.
Also with in this hand gesture we have three sixes.
A six here, a six here and a six here.
Which represents the 666
In the book of Revelations in the Bible.
I like death and destruction and...
Frenzy and hatred.
Not that I like doing it or anything,
I just like reading about it
And hearing it, just like, you know...
Some one likes horror movies or novels.
WOMAN: So a lot of people would think you'd be a violent person.
- Are you?
- No, I'm not violent.
WOMAN: Do you think, Ozzy is a,
You know, messenger of the devil?
WOMAN: Does it bother you that
They accuse you of being satanic?
It pisses me off.
It, it does piss me off.
It's hard to tell what Ozzy's intentions are.
But the thing that we see is the behavior that results
From kids who take the lyrics literally.
WOMAN: So you're not really into the devil then, huh?
- Yes.
- [BOTH LAUGHING]
[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
Hi, I'm Bill Gazzarri.
The godfather of rock 'n' roll.
And welcome to Gazzarri's
On the strip in Hollywood, California.
You can see when the public comes in,
They're normal.
After about a half hour of rock 'n' roll,
They're no longer normal.
They're jumping all over the place.
I mean, you have to pick them off the walls.
WOMAN: Tell me about the Gazzarri dancers
And the contest?
We started to have a Gazzarri dance contest
And then we started to have it every week
With the finals every year.
And then we started giving out
The title Miss Gazzarri dancer of the year.
There's been so much fucking bullshit
About this contest being fixed,
That I'm gonna make damn sure you all understand this.
At the end of the contest
When they announce all the winners.
The judges sheets will be available at the front door,
For any motherfucker to inspect.
And I don't want to take care of all the fucking bullshit
About this contest being fixed.
And we are missing a couple of asses here.
It's a classy place.
And, it's, it's on Sunset
And you think Beverly Hills is classy.
They can't hold a candle to this place.
Love machine grooves away
Grooves you in
Wanting accusation
[CROWD CHEERING]
WOMAN: You every find yourself
Wanting to wear ear plugs in here?
Well, I, I do put cotton in my ears when I come in.
But I hear the music better that way.
No complications
I know that you were dancing
With the best
That's right!
Oh, woman there loves you
She loves you
My name is Cindy Burmisa.
WOMAN: And how has it been being a Miss Gazzarri Dancer?
It has been the greatest time of my life.
WOMAN: What was the best part of it?
Getting up there in front of a million people
And really doing it.
WOMAN: What are you going to do now? Are you gonna, um...
I'm gonna continue on my modeling
And...
Um, hopefully I'll get on with my actressing.
Shooting some movies.
WOMAN: Do you feel bad that
You're almost finished with the titles?
Not at all.
I'll be happy to turn over my crown
And I hope the best for them.
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
Whoa, a woman
That will love you
Love ya
WOMAN: What do you get from winning the contest?
A feeling of accomplishment.
- Really?
- Money.
I think it's a catalyst for my future career.
WOMAN: If you win, what are you gonna do with the $1,000?
Um...
Hopefully invest it into something
Like a down payment on a condo.
That's what I'm trying to do right now.
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
WOMAN: Nadir, tell me whatyou thought of the dance contest.
I, you know, I like to watch a chick dance.
If she wants to dance, come over to my house and dance for me.
Not for a million dudes, you know.
[METAL MUSIC PLAYING]
Let it out!
Let it out!
Let it out!
Oh! You get a zero!
[LAUGHS]
Go, go!
WOMAN: What do you think?
Was the dance contest fun?
That's stupid.
Doesn't belong in music.
Get it away from me.
Fucking, get a comedian up there.
These guys are personal friends of mine.
There's Randy, I love him.
He's gonna be bigger than David Lee Roth,
Who started right here.
Help me bring on my pal Randy, and Odin.
Let's go.
Odin! Odin!
He's believed in us for a long time.
- That's right.
- For a very long time.
Odin! Odin! Odin!
Odin! Odin!
I mean, I know personally that I want...
I mean, I want to go
As big as like Zeppelin,
The Rolling Stones,
The Beatles or like that.
I mean, I don't want to be another band.
I don't want to be just another fucking band.
Odin! Odin!
- Odin!
- Odin! Odin! Odin!
Well, I just wanna be extremely wealthy.
I want to be remembered for the rest of my life
For my grandchildren's grandchildren's lives.
Odin! Odin! Odin!
They're gonna be very, very big in the rock and roll world.
Besides, the singer is a foxy guy.
[ODIN PLAYING LITTLE GYPSY]
Little Gypsy!
Take a trip into the city
Watching everything
That comes by me
My girl she's looking pretty
She's the new girl on the scene
Oh, I've been waiting
Waiting for my turn to come
Watch her move
Watch her groove
She's got me wrapped up on her tongue
Sing it, she's my girl
Lookin' good
I'll take the risk,
Until it's understood
- Gypsy
- Gypsy
- Gypsy
- Gypsy
She's my little gypsy
WOMAN: Randy, why do you wear pants
That don't have no butt in them?
Yeah.
'Cause it ventilates my scrotum sac.
Take a trip into the city
Watching everything
That comes by me
My girl she's looking pretty
She's the new girl on the scene
She's my girl
Lookin' good
I'll take the risk,
Until it's understood
WOMAN: So how long do you think till Odin gets signed?
- The next four to six months.
- Yeah?
- And then what's gonna happen?
- And then super stardom.
Super fucking stardom.
If you want to take me serious, you can,
If you don't want to take me serious, you don't have to.
But I'll say, this face,
People are gonna fucking remember it, okay?
And it's gonna go down in history. I know that.
I don't wanna be like Jim Morrison,
But I wanna go down in history like that.
- Or Robert Plant.
- MAN: That's right.
Or any of the really bigger people.
And I feel it's within us and within me.
- What if it doesn't happen?
- It's gonna happen.
She's my little
Gypsy!
WOMAN: Why do you girls hang out with this band?
- Because they have good music.
- Yeah.
And 'cause they're good looking.
Really good looking.
WOMAN: Do you guys ever get discouraged?
Yeah, there are times when we get really discouraged.
I mean, I've been known to be suicidal and stuff like that.
It's scary sometimes, you know, what I'm gonna be doing
In maybe five or ten years if it doesn't happen or...
WOMAN: Have you ever seriously tried to kill yourself?
I've come pretty close.
Yeah, I have, I have OD-ed and stuff like that.
Yeah, that's why I don't do drugs anymore
- and stuff 'cause...
- GIRL: Yeah, right...
[ALL LAUGH]
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
You get frustrated when your potential
Isn't tapped into at the time, you know.
And you feel like you could be there and you're not,
And it's just... That's the frustration, you know.
It's like you have a one million dollar check in your hand
And you have no place to cash it.
WOMAN: And is that worth killing yourself for?
At times you can be when you think about
Being immortal superstars, yeah.
It can be.
I've never thought of killing myself but I thought of, uh...
Like going out and being a bum, you know, skid row.
You know, taking the easy way out.
WOMAN: So it's either a rock 'n' roll star or a bum.
- That's your, that's your trip.
- That's it.
I think we're ready for a
12 o'clock high!
[PLAYING 12 O'CLOCK HIGH]
Went to the distance
Waiting to see the truth
What have you got?
Now, I
Got what I want
The truth is what you see
When you're looking at me
You tried your luck
You failed the day
You'll never win
'Cause I'm the master of the day
See you at 12 o'clock
12 o'clock
12 o'clock
12 o'clock high
See you at 12 o'clock
12 o'clock
12 o'clock high
Now, I
Am just what you want
Do it to me tonight
Do it right
So, I
Am just what you crave
Number one, I said
Got nothing to say
Sold out every pub we've ever played in the last two years,
Now we're being virtually ignored.
That's frustrating.
WOMAN: Is that worth killing yourself for
If you don't make it?
Well, there's nothing else that I can really do
Except music, you know.
And that's how I feel.
That's all I really wanna do in my life is music,
And if I can't do that
Then fuck everything else around me, really.
12 o'clock
12 o'clock
12 o'clock high
Twelve o'clock high
WOMAN: Do you think that you're gonna be a rock star?
Oh, yes. Yeah, I'm going to be a famous rock star, yeah.
Yeah. Yes, I wanna be a rock star.
Gonna be rock stars.
I'm going to be a rock star.
I am going to be.
We wouldn't mind, being rock stars.
But...
As long as, rock star is defined as rich and... rich.
I think that it'll come pretty easily for me.
You know, 'cause I'm different from everyone else.
WOMAN: What if you don't make it as a rockstar?
Oh, I will.
WOMAN: But if you don't, in 10 years,
What are you going to be doing?
See, I will though, see.
WOMAN: What if you don't make it?
- But I will.
- I will make it.
- For sure?
- I'm not gonna quit until I do.
The main key is perseverance.
And I will persevere.
That question is not in my mind.
The minute you doubt, is the minute you lose it.
What if I don't make it?
I'll find a vacant drainage ditch or something...
Lay my bed down.
I don't know...
End up on skid row or something,
I don't know.
I don't know where I'm gonna be.
WOMAN: Doesn't it worry you?
No.
I'm like him, that doesn't enter my mind.
I can't really,
I can't picture not making it.
You see, if you came and heard us, you'd really...
You'd think the same thing too.
WOMAN: That you are, definitely gonna make it?
Oh, yeah.
WOMAN: What if 10 years from now it doesn't happen?
I don't believe that,
That it won't, because you can do anything in life you want.
There ain't nothing in this world you can't do.
- Do you have a back up plan?
- No.
No such thing.
No back up.
I don't know how to do anything else.
We rock 'n' roll.
That's all we do.
I'm a singer.
- Well, I got no choice.
- Why?
We all fucked up in school.
We all, you know, we're just...
This is what we're here for.
WOMAN: What if you don't end up a rock star?
Well, if I don't, then I'll die trying.
What do you think your tombstone will say?
I don't want a tombstone,
I just...
I just want somebody to dig a ditch and throw me in,
"See you later, pal, have a good one".
WOMAN: When you were a little kid,
Did you want to be a rock star?
Yes, I did. Definitely.
She wouldn't let me.
I go, "Mom, can I take rock guitar?"
She says "Well..."
"No, you can't 'cause you will, you'll turn to one of those"
"Drug infested rock stars."
- Do you like touring?
- Yeah, I love it.
I met women.
Like...
In my whole term... four of them at a time.
Say "Hey, take your drawers off"
And if they don't, I call my security guard next door,
They come, he throws them right out.
"Get outta here".
WOMAN: What do you think about that, Sandy?
I don't think about it.
If you can tour one year,
If you can tour... one year,
It'll take four years off your life.
You know five, four years, five.
WOMAN: So, Chris, how many gold records do you have?
Shit, one, two, three, four, five, si...
I don't know. Who cares?
Who knows?
I don't know.
- So do you...
- Five, six, 10, 12, who cares?
- Do you consider yourself...
- A piece of crap.
Why?
Well, because, you know
I don't work a job
And I'm a piece of crap.
WOMAN: Does it bother you that this lifestyle
Is dangerous to your health?
Health?
What do you mean, health?
Look at me.
I look 40?
- How old are you?
I'm 29.
I'm what they call, an old fuck.
Look at my mom! Shit!
WOMAN: What do you think you're gonna
Be doing in 10 years from now?
Ten? I'll probably be dead.
You can come see my graveyard.
Mom, have a drink.
- Chris? Do you drink very much?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Pardon?
- Do you drink very much?
Yes, I do.
I'm a full blown alcoholic.
Just when he's awake.
I drink too much.
WOMAN: Okay, why do you drink that much?
'Cause I enjoy it.
Do you think a rock 'n' roll lifestyle
- turns you into an alcoholic?
- Yes, it does.
WOMAN: How much of that do you drink a day?
About...
- Five pints
- Of vodka?
Five quarts, pints, who cares?
I'm a happy camper.
WOMAN: Do you think, maybe, just kind of, you know...
Rock 'n' roll lifestyle is hard on you and that's why you drink?
I'm a full blown alcoholic
And why I drink, is 'cause... look...
What?
WOMAN: Why do you drink, Chris?
'Cause it makes me happy...
Happy.
I enjoy drinking.
I just enjoy life.
I'm the happiest son of a bitch and motherfucker, there ever was.
WOMAN: Why do you get so loaded though?
'Cause it's the only thing that...
Lets me get free, you know...
WOMAN: You think you might be covering up some pain?
Yeah, little bit.
WOMAN: Where would that be from,
I wonder?
Here... Do you like this label?
WOMAN: Let's not avoid the issue.
Where would that be from?
This...
Okay... here...
WOMAN: Do you wish... Chris?
Do you wish that you were...
A bigger star, than you are right now?
Do I wish what?
That you were a bigger star than you are?
Not really.
I wish I was a smaller star.
I don't dig being the person I am.
And...
I just don't like it.
I just don't...
Been the person who...
Who's like...
Excuse me...
Being who I am is like...
Here, watch.
I had a whiskey bottle the size of the Empire State building
In front of me all the time.
I have a disease called alcoholism
And drug... drug... drug dependency.
I am actually an alcoholic now,
I guess I think...
I'm probably about four on the
Richter scale of alcoholism.
I was always at about 3.2, at all times.
If I would've been stopped driving at any time,
Even if I hadn't anything to drink for two weeks,
I would still have been legally drunk.
I'd get tired of waking up
Hungover, having to do a couple of lines,
And a couple of beers, just to get moving, you know.
Which is where I was at...
Then you gotta get the act together
So you can go and cop dope.
WOMAN: What was the Betty Ford Clinic like?
Boring.
No, actually...
The educational value was okay, it made me realize
That I was an alcoholic and that I am a drug addict.
But still, I am an alcoholic.
You always are, you know.
- But you feel better now?
- No.
But after a while, when you do it so much,
It's like the same as the first time.
It turns into a... you know, it turns against you
- especially with drugs.
- Did rock 'n' roll do it to ya?
Yeah, well, I guess it did because
We got a free bottle backstage every show you see, so...
I mean you don't wanna leave the last
Quarter of the bottle so you tend to finish it up, you know.
The worst thing I can imagine is hurting yourself.
You may as well just jump off a building,
I mean what's the difference?
These bands really wanna make it.
They stay away from drugs, maybe these kids will do
The drugs that float for free, every once in a while
But that doesn't happen much.
It's just there is not enough time.
Most of the kids who wanna make it stay away from drugs.
- No, I'm not into drugs.
- I think drugs suck.
It's bullshit. We've seen it ruin a lot of people.
Personally, I find that I don't need drugs to have a good time.
All I need is loud music, and a lot of friends.
I don't think you can enjoy a show,
If you go and get wasted, you know,
Don't even remember the show the next day.
Basically, the metal is a drug to me
I don't need it to get strung out or anything, if I hear
Like Sabbath Volume Four, that is my drug.
You can't be a musician and a drug addict.
Neither one nor the other.
I don't know, people ask me if I am an alcoholic,
I guess you can consider me an alcoholic, I drink every day.
I don't think
I let it affect my life.
I show up for band practice,
I mean that's all that's important.
We do drugs, we do alcohol.
It doesn't mean you should do it.
Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll used to be a fun thing to do
But it ain't any more.
You can play Russian Roulette for five years and
Never get hurt and then one time
You pull the trigger and it's all over.
The thing is, belief in yourself should be the drug, really.
Your confidence is what should really inspire you
And keep you going to do what you wanna do.
Think a lot of people look to people in show business
Or anybody who's famous
To model their lifestyle on.
One of my role models was Keith and every once in a while
I'd see him...
We'd exchange goodies.
But I always looked up to him for the way of life that he
Lived, and it was a way of life for him, it still is.
And sometimes, they're your friends and...
You have to stop being their friend
When they don't listen because
It's like somebody drowning.
They'll drag you down with them, it's just not worth it.
So... if you're modeling your lifestyle on somebody
And it turns out that they died on smack,
That's not very clever, see.
I don't think there's anything admirable
About being a dead legend,
And that's probably the reason why I'm not into it.
It was killing me, and I felt that I was probably
Much more effective alive than dead.
I wouldn't put that to a vote.
Go check out Jim Morrison and Jimmy Hendrix
And Janice Joplin, that's not my idea of fun.
Because it's a lot of hours of throwing up blood and stuff
Like that and if you're gonna do that on stage, it's great
But it's not that much fun in a Holiday Inn, you know.
I have a prescription for a happy life which is,
Sex, drums and rock 'n' roll.
[ROCK SONG PLAYING]
BILL: We kinda let that go, but the rules of my contest is
That's a little bit too skimpy because
We're looking for a
Gazzarri dancer, not kind of a
Risqué stuff like that.
There will be no bikinis, or G-strings or stuff like that,
They have to wear foxy rock 'n' roll clothes.
[BOOING]
Boo?
Boo?
Boo?
Okay...
I'll tell you what?
Why don't you guys run a contest?
- [CROWD CHEERING]
- Okay?
You mean, you want a strip contest instead?
- MAN: Fuck you, man.
- Okay.
GIRL: They're just looked at as sex objects.
'Cause afterwards, the guys make fun of them anyway.
You can hear 'em talkin' about it, making fun of them.
She starts taking all her shit off, right
And all of a sudden,
I notice while she's dancing,
That she doesn't have any fucking underwear on
And we're sitting there going,
"Fuck, we have muff, we have muff!'"
[CROWD CHEERING]
[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
You know what, he ended up that night with the...
Fifth runner up.
We did all right.
WOMAN: So, Bill,
You walk around the club all the time with these
18 year old girls and people ask you "How you do it, right?"
What do you say?
I liked 18 year old girls, when I was 18!
I love 'em now!
Why should I stop?
[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
They say "You're not like a
60-year old guy",
"You're like three 20 year old guys, with all the energy you have".
Rock 'n' roll forever!
WOMAN: That's a cut.
So what's the biggest audience you ever played for?
Well, that would be in probably in Hungary.
- How many people?
146,000 people.
158,000 people in São Paulo, Brazil.
- Which is still a record.
- You beat KISS?
- Well, we always try.
- Yeah.
You're looking at 83,000 people thinking,
"Man, I gotta entertain these people"
You know what I'm saying,
83,000 shoes times two makes...
What is that?
A state. It wasn't police there, there was the army,
The whole army, was like the security.
And the great thing about it was that it was in Brazil
And the nice thing about that is you really realize rock 'n' roll
Is the thing that holds the world together.
'Cause music is the common language.
Oh, the first time you break through to an audience
And they all go nuts, that's better than screwing,
You know that's better, that's the best.
Better than sex,
Better than anything in the world you could ever do.
It's like this...
I love it. It's great.
- It's like beating off?
- It's worse than that.
WOMAN: What do you think about kids that wanna try to make it?
Sure, I did, why not?
Go for it.
If you think you've got it!
Shove it out. Run it up the flag pole and see who salutes it.
The only people that are ever gonna tell you
You can't accomplish something are the ones who fail.
I'm not here to tell you, you can't do something
'Cause I did it.
You can do it.
TYLER: I wanted it so bad.
You know that's one thing looking back, I know that...
If you want something that bad,
And you think positive about it,
And... to the point where you become it,
Therefore you are it.
You gotta believe that you're going to make it,
And if you don't, at least you gave 100% trying to make it.
Anybody that sits on top of his palace, after you've worked
All your life to get it and says
"It's lonely at the top, it's just miserable, it's just..."
They're full of it.
It's the best.
But at the same time, we're not such thin people, that you know
I mean we dry up and blow away, you know
Start injecting drugs, because, you know,
We didn't get a hit single or something.
I'd rather be happy.
I would rather be broke and happy, than rich and sad.
WOMAN: What do you have to say to kids
Who wanna make it as a rock star?
Don't!
What I wanna be when I grow up?
I would say...
I would say happy.
Did you ever think that I'd get lonely?
Did you ever think that I needed love?
Did you ever think,
Stop thinking you're the only one I'm thinking of?
You'll never know how hard I tried
To find my space and satisfy you too.
Things will be better when I'm dead and gone.
WOMAN: Do you ever feel that way about your parents?
I've had a pretty good relationship with my folks.
- I don't know.
- Are they proud...
A lot of people have a bad relationship with their parents,
That's why they end up being disappointed with life.
They take it out on themselves, a lot of parents
Are real dickheads. They treat their kids real miserably.
You know, and that's why we grow up like this.
I'm in this business for the reason that
Megadeth is in this business and that's because of attitude,
Integrity and music.
WOMAN: Do you want to live a lifestyle of a...
- of a rock star?
- Nah!
That's megalomania to me,
I don't wanna get used to something that'll run out,
I'd rather stay myself all the way, and not ever
Get used to, you know, having a huge lifestyle
So that in case anything happens like I lose an arm or something,
Then you know, I have to get used to being a bum again.
We don't want to sit here and talk about all kinds of
Perverted sexual games we do on tour,
We don't want to sit here and talk about drugs,
We don't talk about a lot of same old rehash stuff that bands
Keep doing over and over again in this business...
Yeah, I wanna stay on a street level because then I don't have
Any pretentious values in life.
I don't start writing music just for the dollar sign.
[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
We're on the road so much
That you have to freaking keep your wits about you.
This music is technical music, it is
Harder to play than most of the other rock bands out there and,
I think that you need to keep your chops in shape,
You need to keep your health in shape.
And I'm not gonna cheat the audience that way,
I don't get high when I'm practicing at home alone,
So why should I do it when I go up on stage?
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,
A band should go up on stage
And play for themselves, not having to put make-up on
And stuff like that.
I mean, it's like a wall of
Marshalls and your band playing,
That's a show for me.
[PLAYING IN MY DARKEST HOUR]
In my hour of need,
Ha, no, you're not there
And though I reached out for you
Wouldn't lend a hand
Through the darkest hour
DAVE: Well we get categori zed
Into a lot of different metal monikers...
WOMAN: What so far?
Megadeth, that's the best way to explain us
Because we don't really like to be labeled anything,
I think categorization is a sin because it cuts you off
It doesn't let you go any far, you can't expand,
Some of the satanic bands, they can't write anything about
Politics or love or anything like that or no love or whatever
Because they're dealing strictly with Satan.
WOMAN: So, Dave, how come you write about death so much?
Not only death, it's more about awareness you know
Because without death life would be
Meaningless, don't you think?
Raise your head, raise your face, your eyes
I mean life, death, sex,
- pretty happening to me.
- Yeah.
- What else is there?
- Beer, maybe.
Beer!
[WOMAN LAUGHS]
I walk, I walk alone
Into the promised land
There's a better place for me
But it's far, far away
Everlasting life for me
In a perfect world
But I gotta die first
Please, God, send me on my way
Time has a way of taking time
Loneliness is not only
Felt by fools
Alone I call to ease the pain
Yearning to be held by you
Alone so alone I'm lost
Consumed by the pain
The pain, the pain, the pain,
Won't you hold me again?
And you just laughed, ha ha, bitch
My whole life is work
Built on the past
But the time has come
When all things shall pass
This good thing passed away
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
DAVE: When it starts going to your head
And you start thinking that you're God, it's stupid!
Because in my book, there's always somebody better.
It's like David Lee Roth said,
You're here today, gone later today
WOMAN: You guys get signed yet?
It's getting close, very close.
Everybody in rock 'n' roll, heavy rock,
Is supposed to be stupid, and we're not stupid.
Rock 'n' roll should corrupt kids enough to think.
There's nothing wrong with thinking.
They will not stop rock 'n' roll.
This is what it is.
To be a rock 'n' roll star
Is the greatest thing in the world
Popes don't get laid and I do.
Just be real careful, wear a rubber,
And don't do drugs, what can I say?
Just remember one thing,
You meet lot of people on the way up,
Don't fuck them 'cause you meet them on the way down as well.
I love you.
[UNDER MY WHEELS BY
ALICE COOPER PLAYING]
The telephone is ringing
You got me on the run
I'm driving in my car now
Anticipating fun
I'm driving right up to you, babe
I guess that you couldn't see, yeah, yeah, yeah
But you were under my wheels, honey

Never stops ringing
'Cause when you call me on the telephone, sayin'
Take me to the show
And then I say, honey, I just can't go

Here he comes!
Oh, it's turning.
Oh, oh, Elvis! Elvis!
Mr. P., can I get you some sandwiches?
That will be fine, Pauline.
I'm gonna check on Lisa Marie, honey.
Okay.
Sleep tight, darling.
Good morning, everybody.
It's WGAN Radio in Portland, Maine.
It's 74 degrees and 8:05.
Time to get ready for Elvis Presley.
Elvis will be coming later today
for his concert at the
Cumberland County Auditorium.
Elvis' show is almost sold out,
but we have six tickets here at WGAN
and we'll be giving them away to you, so stay tuned.
You just might be a lucky winner.
Colonel Parker is already over at the Sheraton Hotel,
and Elvis' guys are setting up for his arrival.
So don't touch that dial if you want you know everything.
I'll be talking to some of the "Memphis Mafia",
as they've come to be known,
and we'll have the up-to-the-minute word
on what's happening with Elvis in Portland.
Elvis is still in Graceland, his home in Memphis...
But he'll be arriving here later this afternoon
in his personal jet, the "Lisa Marie".
Now, here's another Elvis record, his latest hit...
"Moody Blue".
Well, it's hard to be a gambler
Betting on the number that changes every time
When you think you're gonna win
You think she's givin' in
A stranger is all you'll find
Yeah, it's hard to figure out what she's all about
That she's woman through and through
She's a complicated lady so color my baby Moody Blue
Oh, Moody Blue...
Excuse me, Colonel,
Joe Esposito is on the phone from Memphis.
Yeah, Joe.
Colonel, I'm at
Baptist Memorial Hospital.
I'm afraid I've got some terrible news.
Elvis is dead.
Pandemonium has broken out
here on Elvis Presley boulevard in Memphis.
Thousands of fans from all over the country
are converging on Graceland trying to get in
to view the body of the 42-year-old
king of rock and roll.
The world is shocked by Elvis Presley's sudden death
after attempts to save his life failed.
The apparent cause, according to his personal physician,
Dr. George Nichopolous, is a heart attack.
The singer's father,
Vernon Presley,
has requested that an autopsy be performed.
Everyone stay back!
I was raised on Elvis.
We started when I was 10 years old.
My mother and daddy loved him, and I just say I was raised on him.
There's nobody else like him and there won't ever be anybody else like him.
Why go to all this trouble?
Because we love Elvis.
We still do.
You're not going to get in, you know.
Doesn't make any difference.
I'm friends with a few people in the group,
I want them to know I'm here.
Maybe they'll see me on the street.
We loved him very much.
I just can't believe he's dead.
It's terrible, but I just thank god that Elvis died here in Graceland instead of on the road like any other rock and roll singer.
Whether you're black or white, whether you're country, redneck, or a freak, young or old, from Moscow,
London, or Memphis,
Elvis Presley will still be the king of rock and roll to me.
Please wait up against the curb.
I was born in a small cotton town in the rolling hills of Mississippi.
I guess Tupelo was as good a place as any to grow up in.
As far back as I can remember, grandma lived next door.
Daddy was a sharecropper, and most of the time we got by alright.
But one year, he went to prison after writing a bad check for some food.
Mama got us through by taking in washing and sewing.
Mama and I were always real close.
I had a twin brother, Jesse, but he died at birth, so I was an only child.
We were a religious family.
The first singing I ever did was in church.
Gospel songs were always a strong influence on my music.
...some fine morning when this life is old
I'll fly away
I'll fly away, oh, glory
I'll fly away
when I die hallelujah by and by
I'll fly away
I guess I was kind of a loner, but I wasn't much different than the other kids
I grew up with.
I'd hang around parts of Tupelo my folks never even knew about.
If mama had known where I was half the time,
I would have caught hell for it.
This friend of mine used to take me across town to an area called Shakerag, and that was when
I first heard the blues.
It sure was a lot different than the music we were singing in church.
Let's watch them play.
...treatin' me this way
Baby, goin' to Gary...
I realized then that music...
The blues, gospel, or whatever...
Is all about letting out what you're feeling inside.
Baby, you had no business
Treat me this way
For Elvis's birthday
Vernon and I saved up and gave him a choice between a bicycle and a guitar.
Elvis sure loved that guitar.
There simply wasn't enough work for Vernon in Tupelo.
He tried everything he could, but we just couldn't make a steady living down there.
We hated to admit it, but we were broke... flat broke.
We packed everything we could into our old Plymouth and moved on.
Things just had to get better.
The years in Memphis weren't much easier for us, but at least daddy had a job at a paint company and mama was working part time.
Around other kids,
I felt kind of different.
Maybe it was the clothes I wore, that I had long hair and sideburns when other guys had crew cuts, but somehow
I just didn't fit in.
I guess, in a way,
I was kind of shy, but I knew something good was going to happen to me someday.
I just didn't know what.
Let me introduce my new Rocket 88
Yes, it's straight just won't wait
Everybody likes my Rocket 88...
I worked different jobs after school so I could afford my favorite
R&B records and sharp clothes.
People always bugged me about my hair.
Later on, I had so many kids using pomade...
That greasy kids' stuff...
I should have got a piece of the action.
But I liked my hair long,
'cause that's the way truck drivers wore it.
I went to Humes High in Memphis, where I got my share of B's and C's.
I thought I might do better in music, but the teacher gave me a flat F and wouldn't let me in the Glee Club.
That was very good, Mandy.
Thank you.
Alright.
Our next "Club Day" performer is Elvis Presley.
Elvis? Come on up.
It's your turn.
I was real nervous when I had to get up there.
I thought most of the kids in class were going to laugh at me
'cause they figured
I wasn't good at anything.
When my turn came,
I tried an old rhythm and blues song
I'd been practicing.
Train a-Ride
Sixteen coaches long
Train a-Ride
Sixteen coaches long
Well, that long black train
Got my baby a-Home
Train, train
Comin' down, down the line
Train, train
Comin' down, down the line
Well, that long black train
Got my baby a-Home
Everything seemed to change for me that day I sang in front of my class.
And after that,
I could always count on my music to help me make friends...
Especially girls.
After graduating high school,
I made a record for my mama's birthday.
I'd kind of gone there to be heard by the owner, Sam.
Later, Sam called me back to work with Scotty Moore and Bill Black, two fine musicians.
At the time,
Sam Phillips was recording a lot of black artists, and the word around Memphis was he was looking for a white singer with a black sound.
We tried to cut a record for six months with about 50 songs.
Nothing sounded right.
Alright.
Hold it, you guys.
Bottom line here is this is just not making it.
Now, if we can get something that will, great.
If not, let's rack it up.
Elvis, you can pull it out of yourself.
You can do it.
Alright, sir.
Do you guys remember that old blues song we used to do?
Then it all kind of clicked.
Even on the first take, we knew we had something.
Well, That's All Right, Mama
That's all right for you
That's all right, mama, do just any way you do
Well, that's all right, that's all right
That's all right now, mama
Any way you do
Well, mama she done told you
Papa done told me, too
Son, that girl you foolin'
Well, she ain't no good for you
Well, that's all right
That's all right
That's all right now, mama
Any way you do
...Red Hot Blue this record'll flat get it, people.
It's called
"That's All Right, Mama".
It's gonna be a big record for a boy.
His name is Elvis Presley.
It's on the sun record label from here in Memphis.
And it's been the most requested tune for two or three nights.
Elvis, Scotty, bill, and me will all be uptown next week at the Chiska Basement.
I want you people to come see us.
Remember, Phillips told you,
"That's All Right, Mama".
I'm leavin' town today
Suddenly, it was like my whole world turned upside down.
We played local gigs all through the south.
Everywhere we went, the crowds got bigger and the girls wilder.
Then one crazy day, we were somewhere on the road,
I don't even know where, a man came backstage and introduced himself...
Colonel Tom Parker.
Our son wasn't even 21 when Gladys and I first met Colonel Tom Parker.
He was already well-known for having managed Hank snow and Eddy Arnold.
Right from the start, Colonel
Parker believed in Elvis.
Then in 1956, the country got its first look at Elvis on national television.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I'd like to present one of radio's most listened to disc jockeys... Bill Randall.
William.
We'd like at this time to introduce you to a young fellow who, like many performers,
Johnnie Ray among them, come up out of nowhere to be, overnight, very big stars.
We saw him for the first time while making a movie short.
We think tonight he's going to make television history for you.
We'd like you to meet him now...
Elvis Presley.
Well, get out of that kitchen and rattle those pots and pans
Get out of that kitchen and rattle those pots and pans
Well, roll my breakfast
'cause I'm a hungry man
I believe you was doin' me wrong
And now I know
I believe you was doin' me wrong
And now I know
'Cause the harder I work the faster my money goes
Well, let's shake, rattle, and roll
I said shake, rattle, and roll
I said shake, rattle, and roll
I said shake, rattle, and roll
Well, you won't do right to save your doggone soul
Hey
I'm like a Mississippi bullfrog
Settin' on a hollow stump
I'm like a Mississippi bullfrog
Settin' on a hollow stump
I've got so many women
I don't know which way to jump
Well,
I said flip, flop, and fly
I don't care if I die
I said flip, flop, and fly
I don't care if I die
Don't ever leave me don't ever say goodbye
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
After that first time on television, things really took off for me.
I couldn't believe the fans around the country.
Wherever we went, people wanted to get to us.
They didn't try to hurt me, they just wanted to take home part of me as a souvenir.
You make me so lonely, baby
You make me so lonely...
People asked why I moved around so much on stage.
Well, it just came natural to me, the way I felt rock and roll.
Well, now if your baby leaves you
You've got a tale to tell
Well, just take a walk down lonely street
To heartbreak hotel
You're gettin' so lonely, baby
You're really lonely
You'll be so lonely you could die
Well
Well, I think Elvis Presley has a nice style and sings okay, but when he gets on the stage, he starts to drive those girls nuts by shaking and jumping and laying all over the stage.
You know what I mean?
Right. And you think that's bad?
Well, it's kind of crazy.
No, it depends on how you look at it.
If you want to think it's nasty or sexy you could, but to me, it's just...
The two things are not necessarily the same.
Yeah, well, it's just so limber and loose.
It's really marvelous.
Well, he just feels the rhythm.
Digs it the most.
You don't see anything wrong with it?
No.
You just stand there.
Now, everybody stand in line and I...
Hey, what are the Ritz Brothers doing here?
I was... hey, young man, if you want an autograph, would you stand in the back there?
I don't care who you are.
I'm Elvis Presley.
Elvis Presley!
Give me the good old
Rudy Vallee days.
Elvis, sing your hit song.
You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog
Cryin' all the time
You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog
Cryin' all the time
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine
Well, they said you was high-Class
Well, that was just a line
I had no idea this performance of "Hound Dog" was gonna cause such a row.
The critics jumped all over me for it.
I still can't figure out what got them so riled.
You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog
Cryin' all the time
You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog
Cryin' all the time
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
You ain't no friend of mine
You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog
Cryin' all the time
You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog
Cryin' all the time
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
You ain't no friend of mine
There is no room in this city for the vulgar performances of Elvis Presley.
It's shocking.
I watched him gyrate his legs and swivel his hips, and our parent-teachers group feels he should not be on television.
We've set up a 20-man committee to do away with this vulgar, animalistic, nigger, rock and roll bop.
Our committee will check with the restaurant owners and the cafes to see what Presley records is on their machines, and then ask them to do away with them.
People started calling me a sex maniac, saying I was lewd and obscene.
It got to be ridiculous when the police filmed my shows.
I thought the bad publicity would hurt my career, so I took a shot at telling my side of the story.
Hello?
Hy Gardner calling.
I have Elvis Presley on the phone.
Hello, Elvis?
Less than two years ago, you were earning $14 a week as a movie usher, and then $35 a week for driving a truck in Memphis.
Today, you're the most controversial name in show business.
Has this sudden notoriety affected your sleep, your appetite, or the size of your head?
Not the size of my head.
It's affecting my sleep.
How much sleep do you get?
I average about four or five hours a night.
Is that enough?
No, but I'm used to it and I can't sleep any longer.
What do you keep in mind mostly?
I mean, some of the songs you're going to do, or some of your plans or what?
What goes through your mind?
Well, everything has happened to me so fast in the last year and a half till... I'm all mixed up, you know?
I can't keep up with everything that's happening.
Your style of gyrating while you sing has been bitterly criticized even by usually mild and gentle TV critics.
Do you Bear any animosity towards these critics?
Well, not really.
Those people have a job to do and they do it.
Do you think you've learned anything from the criticism leveled at you?
No, I haven't...
Because I don't feel
I'm doing anything wrong.
You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog
Cryin' all the time
Rock and roll has got to go...
And go it does.
At KWK, we're all through playing rock and roll records.
This week is record-breaking week here at KWK.
And after this week, no more rock and roll will be played on the air.
The obscenity and vulgarity of the rock and roll music is obviously a means by which the white man and his children can be driven to the level with a nigger.
It is obviously nigger music.
It is our feeling here in Jersey City that this rock and roll rhythm is filled with dynamite, and we don't want the dynamite to go off in the Roosevelt Stadium in Jersey City.
After, uh... we, uh...
Heard about the incidents throughout the country and the coming of this concert to Jersey City,
I asked our commissioner of public safety,
Lawrence Whipple, to look into the matter, and he did make a survey of the situation.
My department made a very thorough investigation of these so-called programs.
We had telephone conversations and correspondence with various municipalities.
Included among these being
Hartford, Connecticut,
Orange, New Jersey, Asbury Park, and the City of Hoboken.
We find that these programs are not for the good of the community, and that's why
I ordered them banned.
I don't see that any type of a music would have any bad influence on people when it's only a music.
I mean,
I can't figure it out.
In a lot of the papers, they say rock and roll is a big influence on juvenile delinquency.
I don't think that it is.
What about the rumor that you once shot your mother?
Well, I think that one takes the cake.
Where does that one come from?
I have no idea.
I can't imagine.
There's another one, you may not have heard before.
Several newspaper stories hinted that you smoked marijuana in order to work yourself into a frenzy while singing.
Well, I don't know.
All the attention
I'd been getting got the studios interested in me.
My first film was going to be called "The Reno Brothers",
I had a hit song out at the time, so they renamed it
"Love Me Tender".
The Colonel put together a huge premiere in New York City, but when the movie opened, some film critics took potshots at my acting.
Still, the picture did real well at the box office, thanks to the fans.
We want Elvis!
We want Elvis!
In the film, Richard Egan played my brother.
And because we were both in love with Debra Paget, we ended up in a shootout.
There's nothing else between us, I swear it.
Well, go on, take him now, or I'll take him myself.
Vince?
Come on, let's get the money and get out of here.
Get away from him.
Leave him alone!
Don't move. Just lie still.
Cathy, where's Vince?
I got to talk to him.
Right here, Clint.
Vince, I didn't mean it.
I know you didn't, Clint.
You don't have to tell me.
Everything's gonna be alright.
Everything's gonna be alright.
I saw the film for the first time with my folks in Memphis.
After the picture ended,
I remember having to calm mama down.
At first, I didn't realize what was wrong.
She was upset and crying.
Finally, she said she just couldn't stand to watch me getting killed up there on the screen.
...that I love you
And I always will
In 1957,
Elvis bought us Graceland, a beautiful house and farm outside Memphis.
We felt like we were living way out in the country.
Merry, merry Christmas, baby
Sure did treat me nice
Elvis insisted Vernon and me and his grandmama move in and live with him.
By then, Elvis already had six or seven Cadillacs.
He used to say if he ever went broke, he could always open a used car lot.
Give me diamond rings for Christmas
And I'm livin' in paradise
Those were good times for us.
Almost everything was going right for me.
I liked having people around, but I started to feel, even with my old friends, things were a little different.
Well, I'm feelin' mighty fine
Got good music on my radio
Well, I want to kiss you, baby
While you standin'
'neath the mistletoe
Take it on, baby, take it on
Yo, yo, ho
Hey, you guys, there's that rock and roll cowboy
I told you about.
Do you want him to sing?
I hope we do well in the city as we did in the small towns.
City's just like a small town, only taller.
Hey you, sideburns,
I got a chick down there wants to hear you sing.
Why don't you come around the theater tomorrow afternoon?
He'll be on the stage.
I told my girl
I'd get you to sing.
A man can't go back on his word, can he, fella?
Look, maybe you didn't understand me, fella.
But Mr. Rivers doesn't sing in juke joints, so why don't you run on back and drink your malted?
Say, what's the trouble?
These showpeople starting something?
There's no trouble, sir.
Mind if I sing a little song for them?
No, he don't mind.
Do you, Frank.
No, no, I don't mind.
I got a woman mean as she can be
I got a woman mean as she can be
Sometimes I think she's almost mean as me
A black cat up and died of fright
'Cause she crossed his path last night
I got a woman mean as she can be
In the movies, I was cast as a rock and roll rebel, and I guess those pictures helped build my image as a tough guy.
Well, you ain't bad, sideburns.
What do you do for a living?
I'm with my old man in auto accessories, why?
Well, I usually get paid for singing as a rule.
I figure you ought to do whatever you do for me.
How about putting a new set of seat covers on my car?
Why, sure, sideburns.
What color you want?
I figure his color's yellow, don't you?
Get the police. Quickly.
Not all the fights
I got into were staged.
Around that time,
I got in a scrape with the law and had to appear in a Memphis court.
A guy at a gas station took a swing at me,
I wasn't about to stand there and take it, so I punched him and got busted.
The court finds insufficient evidence to support the charge.
It's funny...
Once you start to make it, some people want to hassle you.
The judge agreed with me and threw the case out, but everyone was still worried about my effect on young people.
Next time I went on television,
I was only filmed from the waist up.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a big show...
A real big show...
With Elvis Presley headlining tonight.
Here is Elvis Presley!
We'd like to tell you that, to all the people watching, and all you people that are here tonight, that we really are thankful for all the success that you made us have and everything.
This is my biggest record, and it goes something like this.
Ah, you know I can be found sittin' home all alone
If you can't come around at least please telephone
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
Well, baby, if I made you mad
For something
I might have said
Please let's forget my past the future looks bright ahead
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby, it's just you
I'm thinkin' of
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
Well, I don't want no other love
Baby, it's just you
I'm thinkin' of
At the end of the show,
Mr. Sullivan called me back out.
He caught by surprise.
Elvis...
Ladies and gentlemen, inasmuch as he goes to the coast now for his new picture, this could be the last time we'll run into each other for a while.
But, I..
Wait a moment.
I wanted to say to
Elvis Presley and the country that this is a real decent, fine boy.
And wherever you go, Elvis...
...the guys who accompany you over there, we want to say that we've never had a pleasanter experience on our show with a big name than we've had with you.
You're thoroughly alright.
So now, let's have a tremendous hand for a very nice person.
After Mr. Sullivan helped put an end to the criticism of me,
I made the film "Loving You".
I don't know what it was about one song in that picture, but people from all over the world sent me hundreds of Teddy Bears.
Just let me be your Teddy Bear
Put a chain around my neck and lead me anywhere
Oh, let me be
Oh, let him be
Your Teddy Bear
I don't want to be your tiger
'cause tigers play too rough
I don't to be your lion
'Cause lions ain't the kind you love enough
Oh, let me be your Teddy Bear
Put a chain around my neck and lead me anywhere
Oh, let me be
Oh, let him be
Your Teddy Bear
Oh, let me be
Oh, let him be
Your Teddy Bear
I just want to be your Teddy Bear
Oooh
What is your connection with Mr. Presley?
Groucho, I'm the president of the
San Diego Elvis Presley fan club, and the honorary president over
100 Southern California chapters of Elvis Presley fan clubs.
Well, that's quite impressive.
Do you have any souvenirs of Elvis, Renee?
Oh, I'm just loaded with them, Groucho.
I can't get in and out of my room. I brought a few.
What have you got there?
I've got some Elvis Presley
Teddy Bear perfume.
And this is the sexiest stuff.
And I have a guitar pick, which I stole.
I want to tell you something else I have, which is my very greatest prized possession.
And that is the red and white western outfit that he wore in the picture
"Loving You" when he sings
"Teddy Bear".
And I wouldn't take a million dollars for it.
In fact, it's insured.
I also finagled around, and I have two locks of his hair.
You have locks of his hair?
Do you have any cream cheese to go with it?
I'll tell you what we do, fellas.
Anybody wants to ask
Hedda Hopper a question, if you'll just raise your hand, when I point at you, just get up and real loud, ask a question and we'll try to answer it.
You.
How much money has
Elvis Presley made since his career started?
Are you kidding?
When he started, he couldn't spell Tennessee.
Now he owns it.
You've been found guilty by a jury of your peers of the crime of manslaughter.
I didn't know if it was movies following real life or the other way around, but in the film "Jailhouse Rock",
I was standing in front of a judge again.
This time,
I got sent up the river.
A little while back,
I had a vacation with a bunch of men in a big place way out yonder.
We always had a lot of fun with this one...
The "Jailhouse Rock".
The warden threw a party in the county jail
The prison band was there and they began to wail
The band was jumping and the joint began to swing
You should have heard those knocked-Out jailbirds sing
Let's rock
Everybody, let's rock
Choreographing this title song as a lot of fun.
No wonder this was my favorite production number.
Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
Little Joe was blowin' on the slide trombone
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang
The whole rhythm section was the purple gang
Let's rock
Everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
Number 47 said to number 3,
"You're the cutest jailbird
I ever did see
"I sure would be delighted with your company
Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me"
Let's rock
Everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
Shifty Henry said to Bugs
"for heaven's sake
No one is lookin', now's our chance to make a break"
Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said, "nix, nix
I wanna stick around a while and get my kicks"
Let's rock
Everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
Dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
Dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
Dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
Suddenly, the fantasy life
I'd been caught up in ended when uncle Sam called.
I thought, "well, that's it.
It's all over".
But what really worried me was my mother's health.
She'd been under a lot of strain, and now everything was changing again.
Congratulations.
You are now in the army.
You are all privates.
That's the way you'll be addressed from now on.
Private Presley, you'll be in charge of the group.
As I watched Elvis say goodbye to his friends,
I kept thinking about everything we'd been through as a family.
And now, Elvis was going away.
It's not easy for a mother to say goodbye to her only child...
Especially a son like Elvis.
Bye! Bye!
Bye!
Hup, hup, hup, hup
I got those hup, two, three, four, occupation G.I. Blues
From my G.I. Hair to the heels of my G.I. Shoes
And if I don't go stateside soon
I'm gonna blow my fuse
We'll get hasenpfeffer and black pumpernickel for chow
I'd blow my next month's pay for a slice of Texas cow
I got those hup, two, three, four, occupation G.I. Blues
From my G.I. Hair to the heels of my G.I. Shoes
And if I don't go stateside soon
I'm gonna blow my fuse
Occupation G.I. Blues
Occupation G.I. Blues
Occupation G.I. Blues
At ease
I went through basic training in Texas, and I had my folks move down.
I rented them a nice place in Killeen, a small town just off the base.
It wasn't exactly Graceland, but at least it was off limits to Drill Sergeants.
When my mother's health took a sudden turn for the worse, she returned to Memphis.
I took a private plane home as soon as I could get an emergency leave.
Daddy was already at the hospital taking care of mama.
How long are you going to be in town?
When Elvis arrived at the hospital,
I had the tough job of telling him it was more serious than we thought.
When we went into her room,
Gladys was real weak, but you could see a sparkle in her eye when she saw Elvis walk in.
As we left,
I had this empty feeling in my gut.
When I first saw mama,
I couldn't help crying.
Then she calmed me down, just the way she always had.
I left there praying she'd get better, but she passed away the very next night.
My mother's death affected my whole life.
I loved her so very much.
All of a sudden,
I felt like my life had no meaning without her.
A month later, we were shipped off to New York, our point of departure for Germany.
I was relieved the reporters didn't ask me about my mother.
Elvis, did the other soldiers give you a rough time because you're famous?
No, sir.
I was very surprised.
I've never met a better group of boys in my life.
They probably would have if it had been like everybody thought.
I mean, everybody thought
I wouldn't have to work and I would be given special treatment and this and that.
But when they looked around and saw I was on KP,
I was pulling guard and everything like they were, well, they figured,
"well, he's just like us".
Elvis, what do you think about going to Germany?
Well, sir, I'm kind of looking forward to it.
I mean, just before
I came in the army, we were planning a tour of Europe, and I got quite a bit of mail from over there and everything, and I'm kind of looking forward to it, really.
Arriving in Germany was something else.
I'd never been out of the states before, except for one weekend when I played in Canada.
It was some kind of surprise, the welcome the German fans gave me.
I just couldn't believe it.
It was as wild as anything back home.
I was stationed with the third armored division about 30 miles from Frankfurt.
Colonel and I decided
I was in the service to be a solder, not a singer.
But a lot of officers pressured me to perform at army bases.
I never did.
Sometimes we'd go out on tank maneuvers, and it would get so cold at night, we'd have to pop bennies to stay awake.
If you fell asleep on watch, you could get frostbite.
I rented a home in Bad Nauheim, a town near the base, and I sent for my daddy and grandma to come over and live with me.
Well, happy birthday, son.
I was in Germany a total of 15 months.
On my 25th birthday, just before heading home, we had a small party.
While over there, I met a young girl, Priscilla Beaulieu, whose father was a Colonel in the air force.
She was only 14, but she made a strong impression on me.
I met Elvis about six weeks before his tour of duty was completed.
A friend of mine who knew him asked me if I wanted to meet him.
What girl wouldn't?
Elvis was real friendly, but it was all over so soon.
As I waved goodbye,
I wondered if I'd ever see him again.
After landing on the east coast, we traveled cross country by train.
I'd been thinking about this day for almost two years.
Now it was finally here.
It felt great to be back home in Memphis.
Colonel Parker organized a homecoming.
He was back at work before I could even get out of my uniform.
People usually forget you when you're out of the public eye, but the Colonel felt we'd be able to rebuild my career.
I kept hoping he was right.
Coming home to Graceland was kind of strange.
It felt great to be home and all, but it was a lot different without my mother there.
Being home just didn't feel like it used to, and it was hard not to show it.
Before I even had a chance to unwind,
I had to give a press conference.
Elvis, there have been a lot of rumors about your love life.
Did you meet anyone special in Germany?
Not any special one, no.
There was a little girl that I was seeing quite often over there.
Her father was in the air force, and, actually, they only got over there about two months before I left.
I was seeing her, and she was at the airport when I left.
And there were some pictures made of her.
But it was no big romance.
I mean, the stories came out,
"the girl he left behind," and all that.
It wasn't like that.
I mean...
I have to be careful when I answer a question like that.
Elvis, did you like the food over there...
When you would go out?
I never went out.
You never ate out at the restaurants?
I never ate in a restaurant the entire time I was there.
It's funny. I either ate in the mess hall or at home.
One of the two.
In fact,
I never went anywhere while I was in Europe, except to Paris.
I went to Paris on a leave, and that was all.
Can you give us any details on some of your future plans?
Well, the first thing
I have to do is to cut some records.
And then after that,
I have a television show with Frank Sinatra.
Then it was off to Miami to tape the show.
It's funny, I was a lot more nervous about performing again than I thought I'd be.
Here's the star of our show,
Elvis Presley!
It's very nice to go traveling
but it's so, so nice to come home
he's here in person
I may pass out where the heck are his sideburns?
Well
I'll be a Hound Dog
and that's the opening, friends
Alright,
I'll tell you what we do.
We'll do, uh...
You do witchcraft, okay?
Then I'll do one of the other ones, okay?
We work in the same way, only in different areas.
Love me tender love me sweet
Never let me go
You have made my life complete
And I love you so
Those fingers in my hair
That sly, come-hither stare
That strips my conscience bare
It's witchcraft
Love Me Tender love me true
All my dreams fulfill
For my darling
I love you
And I always will
It's such an ancient pitch
One I wouldn't switch
'Cause there's no nicer witch than witchcraft
I love you and I always will
For my darling, I love you
Man, that's pretty.
And I always will
After he left Germany,
Elvis and I stayed in touch.
He must have run up some incredible phone bills.
When I was 16,
Elvis thought it would be great if I came to live at Graceland.
He called my parents and assured them that I would attend a good private school as well as study modeling and ballet.
My father approved when it was decided that Mr. Presley and his new wife, Dee, would be my guardians.
Elvis never lived a normal life.
He couldn't even go to the movies like most people.
Elvis would have to rent the Memphian Theater after midnight when it was closed.
Fans would somehow always find out about it and show up.
Elvis had a thing about Cadillacs.
Over the years, he bought more than 100 cars for friends.
I remember, in one day, he bought seven of them.
He just loved seeing the expressions on people's faces when he'd give them gifts.
Elvis was the most comfortable at home.
I'd have to say the best times we had were when we were totally alone.
We always had so much fun at Christmas.
Elvis would have goldsmith's department store open up after hours, and we'd go crazy buying gifts for all our friends and relatives.
Christmas was always so important to Elvis.
Those were wonderful times we spent together, but most of the year,
Elvis was away making movies, and it would get awfully lonely in Memphis without him.
For the next few years,
I made about three pictures a year.
By the end of the '60s,
I had racked up 31 films in all.
At first, we worked in Hollywood.
Then we started going to locations like the Seattle world's fair.
I always took my guys along, and most of them had small parts in the pictures.
Elvis, smile for me!
After a while, the movies
I was making became so similar, it was hard to tell one script from the next.
We'd always be kidding around on the set, and Colonel Parker was up to his old pranks again.
He gave me am award for all my challenging roles...
A ham.
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in
Uh-Huh-Huh
Blond hair, good-Lookin' tryin' to get me hooked
Want me to marry settle down
And get a home and write a book
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in
Uh-Huh-Huh
Workin' in the filling station
Too many tasks
Wipe the windows, check the tires
Check the oil, dollar gas
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in
Uh-Huh-Huh
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
While I was making those silly movies, the Beatles were conquering America.
Oh, yeah, I tell you something
I think you'll understand
One psychiatrist recently said you're nothing but four Elvis Presleys.
It's not true.
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
You know, something very nice happened, and the Beatles got a great kick out of it.
We just received a wire from Elvis Presley and Colonel Tom Parker wishing them a tremendous success in our country, and I think that was very, very nice.
Elvis and I decided to get married on May 1, 1967.
We called our friends and families to Las Vegas for the wedding.
I could hardly believe that I was Mrs. Elvis Presley.
You have made my life complete
And I love you so
Love Me Tender, love me true
All my dreams fulfill
For my darling, I love you
And I always will
My reaction to Elvis' marriage?
Well, it's wonderful.
It's about time he settled down.
I hope he'll be happy, you know,
'cause he deserves it.
Actually,
I'm quite relieved.
It's been nothing but Elvis this, Elvis that between me and my girl.
I'm tired of hearing it, really.
He looks so good.
It's hard to believe he's been single all these years.
That Priscilla must be some kind of special lady.
After the wedding, we flew to palm Springs for our honeymoon, where Vernon and his wife, Dee, joined my parents and our friends.
The celebrations continued back at Graceland.
I got something to tell you
that I think you ought to know
that my eyes are on you, baby
since a long time ago
now I've finally got the nerve
and I'm goin' to make my move
now don't you try to turn me off
'cause this is goin' to be hard to do
I got a thing about you, baby
ain't nothing I can do
I got a thing about you, baby
a thing about Loving You
do-do do do do do do-do
ain't no two ways about it, baby...
Nine months to the day after our wedding, our daughter, Lisa Marie, was born.
Elvis was totally ecstatic.
He always loved having family around, and now he was happier than ever.
Know that I can't live without you
I think about you all the time
I got a thing about you, baby
ain't nothing I can do...
Lisa Marie changed his whole life.
Elvis adored her.
This is another convention
of the official Elvis Presley fan club of Great Britain.
The only snag
to cloud this nostalgic jaunt back to the 1950s
is that the object of their affections
won't actually be here in person.
Save me too good to miss
want more of this
the dancing in the aisles
recalls nostalgic memories of the '50s,
when Elvis inspired the youth of the world
with his unique style and smash records.
Will you tell me why you're dressed this way?
Well, rock and roll, wouldn't it? You know.
Elvis first started it.
That was the thing.
He brought it in.
I think Elvis is great.
What's so great about him?
Oh, he's marvelous.
There's nobody that can sing like him.
I feel that if more people in the world would follow Elvis Presley's way of life, the world would be a much better place.
Middle-aged women are here
to recall their long-lost days as trendy mums,
and Teddy boys of years ago have brought their children
to show them what it was like when dad was a teenage bopper.
But where is this man they've come to worship?
Is he a relic of the '50s?
Will we ever see Elvis in person again?
After a while, I was getting tired of making movies.
The scripts were so bad,
I'd actually get physically ill.
I guess I cared too much.
Then we came up with the idea of doing my own TV special.
It had been almost 10 years since I'd performed in front of an audience.
I started getting excited just going to rehearsals.
It was just the challenge
I needed.
The guys closest to me knew what I was going through, especially Joe Esposito.
He was 33, and his personal life had changed a lot with the birth of Lisa Marie, but Elvis wasn't creatively satisfied with what he was doing.
The special got him all worked up again.
Elvis really wanted to show the public he was a lot more of an entertainer than they'd been seeing in his films, but I knew he also had his doubts.
That's it, man.
Well, see you guys tomorrow.
So long, Elvis.
Whenever.
Welcome to NBC and the "Elvis Presley special".
And here's Elvis Presley.
Thank you very much.
We opened the special with some of the guys
I started with back in '54.
My boy, my boy.
It's been a long time,
Jack, I'm telling you.
It's been a while.
A while.
Wait a minute.
There's something wrong with my lip.
You remember that, don't you?
I got news for you, baby.
I did 29 pictures like that.
Hey, Elvis, the fingers.
Yeah. That's all
I could move in Florida.
Yeah, that's right.
The police filmed a show one time in Florida.
So I couldn't move.
I had to stand still.
The only thing I moved was my little finger, like that.
You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog
cryin' all the time you know, for the whole show.
So I told them, I said,
"well, look, man, you can do anything you want to do... "
"You can do anything you want to do, baby".
Well, it's one for the money, two for the show,
Three to get ready, now go, cat, go
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything
But get off of my blue suede shoes
You can knock me down and step on my face
Slander my name all over the place
You can do anything that you want to do
But unh-unh, honey, lay off of my shoes
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes
You can burn my house, steal my car
Drink my liquor from an old fruit jar
Do anything that you want to do
But unh-unh, honey, lay off of my shoes
And don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes
One time baby, one time!
Well, you can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes
The show ended up the most watched television program of 1968.
We all felt great about the way it turned out.
After the special, I wanted to keep performing on stage.
I had the itch again.
I was booked into Las Vegas' biggest showroom.
Fans came from as far away as Europe and Japan.
...ready to burn so get those stakes up higher
there's a thousand pretty women waiting out there the Colonel dressed up the hotel like a carnival.
There were posters, Teddy Bears, and Hound Dogs all over the place.
So viva
Viva Las Vegas
"Here's hoping you have a very successful opening and that you break both legs".
Signed "Tom Jones".
"Best wishes for a continuing successful Vegas show.
"I hope you get a raise in the next six months.
Joe Esposito".
"Dear Elvis, after 15 years, we have finally learned to understand what you say on record".
Signed "RCA".
"Dear Elvis, may you have the biggest of them all".
Who signed that?
No, wait a minute, man.
I misread it.
"May this be the biggest of them all".
I know it, man.
I know it...
"My god, my god, why hast thou forsaken me?"
Signed "The Pope".
What do you mean you can't use them?
I got a telegram from The Pope.
It's a pleasure to be able to see Elvis.
He hasn't been on the stage in
10 years and everyone's waiting.
It's like a championship fight, but
I know he's going to be the winner.
As I got ready for the lights to dim,
I couldn't forget when
I first played Vegas in '56.
A lot of people thought I'd bombed back then.
It shook me up, alright, but tonight would be a lot different.
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Why can't you see
Whoa whoa whoa
What you're doin' to me
When you don't believe a word I'm sayin'?
We can't go on together with suspicious minds
Suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams with suspicious minds
Why can't you see
Whoa whoa whoa
What you're doin' to me
When you don't believe a word I'm sayin'?
Don't you know
I'm caught in a...
I can't walk out
Whoa whoa whoa
Because I love you too much
Caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Whoa whoa whoa
Because I love you too much
Don't you know
I'm caught in a...
I can't walk...
How are you?
Like me to sit down?
First of all,
I plead innocent of all charges.
Is your wife,
Priscilla, with you?
No, she's not.
Why did you start making public appearances again?
I just missed it.
I missed the...
The closeness of an audience, of a live audience.
So just as soon as I got out of the movie contracts,
I started to do live performances again.
Mr. Presley, what is your opinion of war protesters?
And would you today refuse to be drafted?
Honey, I'd just soon to keep my own personal views about that to myself.
I'm just an entertainer, and... I'd rather not say.
Do you think other entertainers should also keep their views to themselves?
No.
Are you satisfied with the image you've established?
The image is one thing, and a human being is another.
How close is the image to the man?
It's very hard to live up to an image. I put it that way.
What about your image as a shy, humble country boy?
I don't know what makes them think that. You know, this gold belt...
Starting in 1970, we spent most of our time touring from one town to the next.
In 7 years, we did 1,094 shows in 130 cities.
I loved being out there again.
It was like back in the '50s.
After a while, the pressures of life on the road started getting to me.
Is that when we got caught that night, chief, at the Gator Bowl?
And you guys put me through a window into a paddy wagon and took me to the hospital.
Did you guys see that rocket this morning?
Did the launch chair go off?
You could see it through the sky when it disconnected up there.
Geege and them saw the explosion. I didn't know.
It's launched right over here.
I had "launch" at 12:30.
I was buried in a beaver.
How was your launch?
Just picture it...
Watch out, Elvis, there's a mike up there.
Oh, you sneaky...
I knew they had them.
That's why I didn't want to say "no".
Now you got to do a five-minute monologue over this.
What a friend we have in Jesus
Well, I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia
California on my mind
Straddled that greyhound and rode him into Raleigh
And on across Caroline
Had motor trouble that turned into a struggle
Halfway across Alabam'
Well, the hound broke down and left us all stranded
In downtown Birmingham
I love you, Elvis.
Elvis!
Elvis!
You ain't gonna come in?
Take-off time will be at 8:15, fellows.
You know that girl
I was with last night?
The dog?
Oh, man.
She gave great head.
Hey, Joe, that chick last night gave greatest head...
Remember that dog he was with?
Well, right away I bought me a through train ticket
Right 'cross the Pacific...
I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham
And smokin' into New Orleans
Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston Town
There are people there who care a little 'bout me...
One year, I was chosen one of the 10 outstanding young men in America.
It was a real honor for me.
I was very moved.
So every dream that I ever dreamed has come true 100 times.
I learned very early in life that "without a song, the day would never end,
"without a song, a man ain't got a friend,
"without a song, the world would never bend, without a song".
So I keep singing a song.
As sure as you were born to buy me a silk suit
And puttin' luggage in my hand
And I'm up up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land
I'm workin' on a T-Bone steak a la carte
Flyin' over to the Golden State
The pilot told us in 13 minutes
He would sit us at the purple gate
The single most exciting concert
I ever gave was an event Colonel Parker set up in Hawaii in 1973.
It was the first worldwide satellite telecast by an entertainer.
It was seen in 36 countries.
Over a billion people were watching.
How was the sound in that building?
Very, very good.
Good.
Sounded like it was good.
It really did.
Man, can Hawaii get sticky.
It's a hot time in Florida.
Rainy night in Georgia
If only I could have seen what was happening to me,
I might have done something about it.
My marriage was falling apart.
Priscilla and I were hardly ever together, and even when we were, things weren't the same.
And one day while I was playing Vegas,
Priscilla came to tell me she wanted a divorce.
At first, I was angry and hurt.
It took a long time for me to accept it, but losing her really got to me.
After all the years together, we just couldn't make things work out.
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Little things
I should have said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
If I made you feel second best
Girl, I'm so sorry
I was blind
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
How are you?
After Priscilla and I split up, it was a strange time.
I was turning 40, and the only time I really felt good any more was on stage.
The best thing happening in my life then was my new girlfriend,
Linda Thompson.
I met Elvis at a time when he really needed someone to be with.
Living with him was pretty strange.
I used to say it was a nice, abnormal life we were leading.
We'd sleep during the day, then stay up all night.
Over the 4.5 years we were together,
I could see Elvis was slowly losing some of his passion for life.
One of the only things he enjoyed anymore was practicing karate was his bodyguards.
Everybody was
Kung Fu fighting
Those cats were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing
It's an ancient Chinese art
And everybody knew their part
From a feinting to a slip
And a kicking from the hip
Everybody was
Kung Fu fighting
Those cats were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing
There was funky Billy Chen and little Sammy Chong
He said,
"here come's the Big Boss
Let's get it on"
He took a bow and make a stand
Started swaying with the hand
A certain motion made me skip
Now we're into a brand new trip
Everybody was
Kung Fu fighting
Go
People, people, people
Oh-Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh
Here at Baptist Memorial
Hospital in Midtown Memphis,
Elvis Presley has apparently checked into a private suite on the 15th floor.
A sign that Elvis is, in fact, here is the aluminum foil that covers his windows to deflect the sun.
A spokesman for Baptist Memorial says Presley has been admitted for exhaustion.
However, private sources tell me the singer is suffering from glaucoma and stomach problems, including an ulcer.
These problems have apparently led to Presley's increased dependency on prescribed medication.
A few of Elvis' entourage are with him here, including his girlfriend, former
Miss Tennessee Linda Thompson.
Our cameras spotted Linda in the hospital's gift shop today.
She was wearing a robe that matched the singing idol's.
On the 15th floor, we managed to catch Elvis and Linda strolling together at the end of the hallway near his suite, guarded by an around-the-clock security man.
We asked some local Memphians how they feel about our most famous citizen's legal and medical problems.
Well, if you don't mind me saying so,
I don't think Elvis has really been happy since he and Priscilla divorced.
He's been working himself way too hard.
All those tours and playing in Vegas so much...
I think it's taken a definite toll on him.
We love him and want to get close to him, but we can't because of all of his bodyguards.
I think they're the ones that are getting him in trouble with the lawsuits.
They're just bad news.
Sonny or Dave, could one of you tell us why you decided to write such a sensationalistic book about Elvis?
When we wrote this book, it was out of bitterness and hurt, to start with.
When we were given three day notice by his father and a week's pay after 16 years.
We all had families, and he wouldn't talk to us himself.
He flew out of town, and he had his father do it.
Why did Elvis fire you?
It was told to us by his father that there was a cutback on expenses...
In 1977,
I started to feel like things were slowly getting out of control.
My health was a constant problem.
But what really shook me was a book by three of my bodyguards.
It hurt me a lot that they would attack me in public.
I never thought friends who once were almost family would turn and try to destroy me.
...that it was because of the lawsuits.
Dave, you seemed to be implying before that you were writing the book, in part, to try and get Elvis to change his ways.
You bet.
We wanted to point out to him what he was doing, not only to himself, but to the people around him.
And we didn't want him to be what he was.
We wanted him to be what we knew he could be and had been.
We were trying to present him with a challenge.
If he saw all these things rolled in front of him and know that they were true,
I don't know how he might have dismissed them in his mind.
Maybe it will do some good for him, for the drug culture, for people to realize no one is out of reach of drugs.
Here is a man that had it in the palm of his hand, and the drugs took it away from him.
What drugs are we talking about?
Uppers and downers, sleeping pills.
We're talking about things like demerol.
You actually saw him...
Yes.
My cousin Red charged in to stop it one time.
He broke the guy's toe going through the door and told him he was going to break him up if he didn't quit getting the stuff to him.
Elvis heard about it, and he called Red and Joe in.
They discussed it for a while, and then finally he looked at Red and said...
I'll never forget it...
He said, "I need 'em, man.
I need it".
We wanted more than anything else to see him as he was in his prime...
On the stage, just knocking them dead.
If you loved him so much, why couldn't you protect him?
How do you protect a man from himself?
I whispered to Elvis to be careful stepping out to the stage.
He was obviously way overweight, and despite his age, only 42, we knew he was in bad health.
Through all the years
I knew him,
Elvis had taken great care to always look his best in public.
It was tough for him, but now Elvis accepted his appearance and so did his fans.
In this, one of his last concerts, just six weeks before his death, he still poured his heart out.
To the end,
Elvis' greatest gift, his incredible voice, never failed him.
Thank you very much.
Don't let the lights and cameras throw you.
And don't throw the lights and cameras, if you can help it.
But they are hot,
I'll tell you for sure.
I'm going to actually play the guitar.
I know three chords, believe it or not.
But I faked them all for a long time.
My kid spent the night, you know.
If you think I'm nervous, you're right.
I'm going to do a song called
"Are You Lonesome Tonight?"
And I am, and I was.
Damn...
I mean, darn. Excuse me.
Are you lonesome tonight?
Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray
To a bright summer day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?
Do the chairs in your parlor
Seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep
And picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain?
Shall I come back again?
Tell me, dear,
Are You Lonesome Tonight
Whoo whoo whoo whoo...
I wonder if you're lonesome tonight.
You know, someone said,
"the world's a stage, and each of us play a part".
...plus tax.
You read your lines so cleverly.
You never missed a cue.
Then he came back too.
He forgot the words.
They'd been changed, you fool.
You're acting strange.
And why, I've never known.
Why I overdid it.
Honey...
Who am I talking to?
You lied when you said you loved me.
You... and I had no cause to doubt you.
I'd rather go on hearing your lies than to go on living without you.
And the stage is bare, and I'm standing there without any hair.
Uh, no.
If you won't come back to me...
Oh, the heck with it.
Is your heart filled with pain?
Shall I come back again?
Tell me, dear,
Are You Lonesome Tonight?
Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to introduce you to my father.
He's been sick for a while, but he's doing very well.
Would you stand up by me, daddy?
I'd like you to say hello to my girlfriend, ginger.
Sit down, ginger.
That's enough for her.
This next song is called "My Way".
And now the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend,
I'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
And more much more than this
I did it My Way
Regrets
I've had a few
But then again
Too few to mention
I did
What I had to do
And saw it through
Without exemption
I've planned
Each chartered course
Each careful step
Along the byway
Oh and more, much more than this
I did it My Way
I've loved,
I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say not in a shy way
Oh, no no, not me
I did it My Way
For what is a man?
What has he got?
If not himself then he has not
To say the words he truly feels
And not the words for one who kneels
The record shows
I took the blows
And did it My Way
The record shows
I took the blows
And did it
My Way
Ladies and gentlemen,
Elvis has left the building.
Oh, I wish I was
In the land of cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Look away, look away
Look away, Dixieland
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Take it, baby.
Glory, glory, hallelujah
His truth is marching on
So hush, little baby, don't you cry
You know your daddy is
Bound to die
But all
My trials, Lord
Will soon be over
Glory, glory, hallelujah
His truth is marching on
His truth is marching on
Memories
Pressed between the pages of my mind
Memories
Sweetened through the ages just like wine
Quiet thoughts come floating down
And settle softly to the ground
Like golden Autumn leaves around my feet
I touch them and they burst apart
With sweet memories
Sweet memories
Of holding hands and red bouquets
And twilights trimmed in purple haze
And laughing eyes and simple ways
And quiet nights and gentle days with you
Memories
Pressed between the pages of my mind
Memories
Sweetened through the ages just like wine
Memories
Memories
Of holding hands and red bouquets
And twilights trimmed in purple haze
And laughing eyes and simple ways
And quiet nights and gentle days with you
Memories
Pressed between the pages of my mind
Memories
Sweetened through the ages just like wine

- THE EXILE -
My name is Malcolm McLaren,
I have brought you many things in my time.
A Teddy Boy named ****** suits suits, fine tailoring, pointy shoes,
Sex clubs, bondage, whips, chains, the whole bloody lot; but the most succesfull of all was an invention of mine that they called,
The Punk Rock.
LESSON 1.
- HOW TO MANUFACTURE YOUR GROUP? -
Find yourself four kids.
Make sure they hate each other.
Make sure they can't play.
Ah, let me start from the begining...
How should we know whether the pope is a murderer?
Fire, fire, fire!
In our case, there was Steve Jones,
18 years of age, a brilliant cat-burglar
In one instance, nearby at
Rolling Stones' Keith Richards' house, he manage to steal a colour tv, a load of nice fur coats, and a bunch of guitars.
Well, I nominated him a guitarist.
Anarchy!
Ahh, there was another fella friend of his, Paul Cook, a typical lout, unafraid of anything criminal, always on time.
We had to provide the bait!
He became our drummer.
Go away!
Do you want these prawns?
I've a lot of burning to do tonight.
Often, lurking in the corner of the shop, i noticed this dickensian figure and a chance to be singer in our group was one he had to take.
When I learned he was Irish and Steve saw his green teeth, we called him Johnny Rotten!
Then there was Sid.
Sidney was a natural terrorist, who arrived too damn late, but he kept in touch as an Agent Provocateur, working in the clubs.
Ensuring that every gig the group played ended up in an unpredictable bloody mess.
Bashing and jumping all about.
He invented the pogo and we gave him a nice name,
Sidney Vicious.
ENEMIES OF THE WORLD
With the lineup complete, we immediately set about putting our plan into effect.
To swindle our way to the top of the rock n roll industry.
It was a plan, that within 2 years, was to bring us close on a million pounds, and a household name as the most filthy, disgusting, dirtiest, rock n' roll band in the whole bloody world.
1978 KIDS AUDITION
ANYONE CAN BE A SEX PISTOL

Sid Vicious, a rock'n'roll cliche.
Paul Cook, hamburguesas
Rock 'N' Roll!
Johnny Rotten his days are even numbered.
Hello Mama!
Rock 'N' Roll!
Swindle! It's a swindle!
Helen, come and turn this racket off!
Haven't you understood anything yet?
You realized these kids didn't buy the records for the music.
That was the case this thing would have died a death years ago.
LESSON 2
- ESTABLISH THE NAME -
Well, to establish the name Sex Pistols i avoided competition of all costs.
I prevented the band from ever playing in any of those Rock'N'Roll houses.
Instead we play strip-tease clubs, prisons, fashionable parties, didn't really matter just any shit-hole that didnt reak of Rock'N'Roll.
I used to plant people in the audience, get them to swear 'nd split.
People throw a few hard throw bottles at the bastards, but i made double-ly sure that it was always the Sex Pistols that got thrown out for causing all the trouble.
I felt the time was right to find a real good solid base, smack in the heart of the record industry.
Remembering all the time never to compete with that necrophiliac Rock'N'Roll.
Not yet anyway.
I walk around down into Soho, looked in the arcades and discos, soliciting young kids.
Didn't want fans who like music, just wanted kids who loved to dress up, mess up.
Get off your arse!
Cultivate the curiosity of the press and other media.
Minimalize the possibility of them ever seeing the group.
# I am an antichrist #
# I am an anarchist #
# Don't know what I want
But I know how to get it #
# I wanna destroy passerby #
# 'Cause I #
# I wanna be #
# Anarchy #
# In the City. #
# Anarchy for the UK #
# It's coming sometime and maybe #
# I give a wrong time stop at traffic line #
# Your future dream is a shopping scheme #
# 'Cause I #
# I wanna be #
# Anarchy #
Forget about music, and concentrate on creating generation gaps.
Call all hippies boring old farts and set light to them.
# How many ways to get what you want #
# I use the best
I use the rest #
# I use the N.M.E #
# I use Anarchy #
# 'Cause #
# I wanna be #
# Anarchy #
# Get pissed! #
Terrorize, threaten and insult your own useless generation.
# Anarchy for the UK #

Suddenly, you become a noble idea.
And you've got people wanting to join in.
You've gained credibility from nothing, you're the talk of the town.
Develop this as a story you can sell.
The first time i layed eyes on Mclaren, he was chasing me down the King's road on account of the clothes i'd just nicked from his shop.
3 years later i steped off the concord from Rio with a foul taste in my mouth.
It was me looking for him.
The trial has lead from the plush appartment of Ronnie Biggs.
Back to the rat ridden streets of Soho.
I thought we was in it together but the swindle had become a vicious circle and now it was reaching me.
He ran his empire from a sleazy back room above a strip club in Greek Street
Malcolm always had good taste, but if he rips me off i'll break his fucking legs.
I tried the safe where he always stashed his dough, he didnt trust anyone, let alone a bank.
The clues were in front of me in black and white,
Bollocks! but i never learned to read or write.
People often ask me the difference between the sex pistols and the beatles.
Soap and water.
I was only a nipper when they was going, but i was fucking glad when they broke up.
Hello, i've got a lesson 3 on the line,
"How to sell the swindle?".
Reverse charges, will you accept the call?
Helen, find yourself a lawyer who has no interest in music.
That is purely interesting in making money.
He's your main asset in developeing the highest price.
And in illustrating to record companies the enormous potential a band that can't play.
Now begins the task of intresting the record companies on your own terms
And get them to start battling against each other for the group.
Dave Dee, please! A&R
- A&R, Dave Dee speaking.
- This is Chris Parry.
Halo, Doug Darcy, Chrysalis records.
What about the Sex Pistols?
They were a particularly ugly band.
It's dreadful.
The group were doing a very private,
I think, secret show, at "The Screen on the Green," lslington.
I went along with a couple of our A&R people, and, eh, Chris Wright, the chairman.
And eh, we got to the door, knocked on the door, somebody opened the door and said, "Fuck off!"
My initial reaction when i walked into the club, you know, was to make the bar which is always quite, you know, the best thing to do.
Well we weren't gonna be dissuaded, so we sort of tapped on the door again and said: "We're invited."
And a head popped 'round again, and said, "Fuck Off!"
It was full of these, you know, young kids.
They were obviously very much into the band.
So we tried a third time, and eventualy another head came out the door and we said:
"Look, we really are invited along".
So they said:
"Okay, you come in, but stand at the back!"
And there was a little bit of a scuffle, nothing much.
Generaly there was an atmosphere of antagonism, you know, of supressed violence.
I've known musicians to defend themselves if the thing goes onto the stage,
But I've never seen musicians drop their instruments and sort of, sort of, dive in a small scrap and like extend it, and forget about the music.
You know, and I found that a bit much.
So, I went back two or three times after that, just to make sure that, um, you know, they were as bad as
I thought they were the first time.
In fact a group that can't play is better then a group that can.
# If you could see... oh God, fuck off... #
# Ayanlouisiannayaya New Orleans #
# Awasabadababyanalittle key #
# Ayainanananananana Johnny B. Goode #
# Agogogogogogo Johnny B. Goode #
# Agogo, go Johnny, gogogogogo #
# I don't know the words! #
# Gogogogogogogogogogogyogyuh #
# Ayayayayastrah yayastrahyayaya #
# Ayayayayastrah andabanayaya #
# I wannawannabay, yayayaya #
# Let's gogo, ago Johnny gogogogo #
# Agogo, go go go go gogogogogogogogogogogogogogo #
# Go, Johnny, go, go #
# Go! Johnny B. Goode #
# Ayayayayayayayayayayayagwuah #
# Oh, fuck, it's awful! #
Hate songs like that! #
Now, you're in the most important position of all, one in which you are able to sign with the most prestigious company in the world.
Don't commit until the last minute, when you finaly come to sign, forget about the future, get as much money as possible, on the dotted line.
Then demand a big party, get all photographers there, make sure it's an important event for them.
Be as obstructive as possible Helen,
in order to fulfill the record company's wildest dreams; that they are obtaining the bargain of the century.
Malcolm McLaren
- CASH FROM CHAOS -
The english autumn was closing in, and so was I.
I was calling on the cunt.
His rambling gothic hideaway on the slopes of Highgate cemetery, overlooked the tomb of Karl Marx, and the bedroom of Lyndsey de Paul.
I had to give it to him, his taste was improving.
Ahoy Malcolm?
There was some old tart at the Joanna.
Nice, very nice!
Who the fuck are you?
My name is Dona De Brett.
And i gave a few lessons to Johnny Rotten, years ago before the group in fact began.
Malcolm Mclaren sent him up to me, and um, with the very worthy idea of teaching him a little about voice production.
I'd say to him, "You start one of your songs", i don't recognise any of these they're all since um, since my day.
But suposing, just suposing, that he took, um, Submission.
And he decided that, um, he would sing
Okay so he might sing that, and i'd say 'right', now i know where we are.
And by the time i was ready, he would have changed key.
No way, absolutly no way, could we pick up a note
Where-as, there, um, um, erstwhile, their manager, erstwhile,
Malcolm Mclaren came up here.
Beautiful ear, he should have been a singer.
It was time to find someone who can read more than music.
I was sure, those letters from the safe, held the key to the swindle.
LESSON 4.
- DO NOT PLAY DON'T GIVE THE GAME AWAY -
# You need hands to hold someone you care for #
# You need hands to show that you're sincere #
# When you feel the nobody wants to know you #
# You need hands to brush away the tears #
# When you hold a brand new baby #
# You need tender hands to guide them on their way #
# You need hands to thank the lord for living #
# and for giving us this day. #
CASH FROM CHAOS
Was all going smoothly now, our record company were footing the bill for a nationwide tour.
The only problem being - the Sex Pistols, a band that couldn't play.
I must admit i was a bit stumped at this point but fortune played into our hands.
The record company came up with the Bill Grundy show.
It was my task to make absolutely sure, that none of us would ever return to normality.
You dirty sod.
You dirty old man.
Keep going, go on, you've got another five seconds, say something outrageous.
- You dirty fucker.
- Clever boy.
- What a fucking rotter.
- Well that's it for tonight.
CENSORED BY
THAMES TV
The show was live the lads were lively, i invited them to shock me, they did
Some people were upset by what those loutish lads said, but it did provide front pages like these.
Carry on lads, swearing or performing
Shut up, shut up!
I personaly have spoke to the, the eh, manager of the group, who tells me that the Sex
Pistols will not perform before the councilors unless we're prepared to come here this evening to see the whole of the show, which we are not prepared to do.
The commitee have decided that the concert of the sex pistols, they will not perform here tonight, but we are quite agreeable that the 3 other groups that have already been booked will go on.
You're sick on stage, you spit at the audiance and so on.
How can this be a good example to children?
Well, people are sick everywhere, people are sick and fed up of this country.
- Telling them what to do.
- But not getting paid for it?
Pardon?
But not getting paid for putting on that sort of public show.
Well nor are we, we aint even being allowed to play...
Makes ya sick dun' it.
Sorry. My personal view on punk rock is that it's nauseating, disgusting, degrading, gastly, sleazy, prurient, voyeuristic and generally nauseating.
I think that just about covers it as far as i'm concerned.
Um, I think most of these groups would be vastly improved by sudden death.
The worst of the punk rock groups i suppose currently, are the Sex Pistols.
They are unbelievably nauseating, they are the antithesis of human-kind.
I would like to see somebody dig a very very large, exceedingly deep hole and drop the whole bloody lot down it.
You know, I think the whole world will be vastly improved by their total and utter non-existence.
Huh, have mercy.
The press is a bleedin' riot today, init?
- What are you trying to do about it?
- Make it work.
You have to expect nothing, you get nothing.
You start off in school and they take your soul away , they take your brains away.
You're not allowed to have an opinion that differs from thiers.
You've got to think what they tell you to think.
So when you leave school your only future is getting married and by the time you're about
29 you've got two kids you just want to commit suicide.
# I've seen you in the mirror when the story began #
# And I fell in love with you
I love your mortal sin #
# Your brains are locked away but I love your company #
# I only ever leave you when you got no money #
That's it.
Read that through Sophie so we can understand what it's about.
"Dear Sounds, why do you devout so much space to the appalling Sex Pistols?
I thought we were trying to cut out violence at concerts, football matches and where-ever.
It's these sick bastards who encourage it.
You just have to look at their audience, i doubt if they've got one
'O Level' between them."
Yeah, that's not bad Soph.
But we gota make fucking sure that we can create enough stink to whip up real hatred before that record comes out.
Have you got a name for this one, i'm fed up with sending letters to the poxy music press.
# I got no emotions for anybody else #
# You better understand
I'm in love with myself, #
# Myself, my beautiful self #
# A no feelings #
# A no feelings #
# A no feelings #
# For anybody else #
# Sleep in heavenly peace #
We hope tonight, by this protest to make Wales know, and time for people of this town know, that we do protest and it is by no fault of ours, that this thing has come to Caerphilly.
We have done everything humanly possible to ban this thing and to stop it.
And as we have not been able to we have done the last thing possible to stand here in open protest to let you now that we are responsible and we are doing all we can to set an example in leadership and in every other way for free living, home-ly living and pure living.
The thing is they're outside, freezing.
We're in here, we're all right.
Caerphilly didn't quite what to expect so took no chances.
Pubs and cafes were closed before and after the concert.
On decible points the
Sex Pistols won, on numbers it was a victory for the carol singers.
Excuse me Sir, can i ask you why you're here tonight?
Because i'm, um, recognise as a christian.
Nevermind about christianity, i think it's, well, degrading and disgusting for our children to hear and see such things.
Eh, I got teenage daughters, and, eh, youngsters, they went and went to Rod Stewart
but i wouldnt let them go to see this rubbish.
If i thought one of mine was in there, i'd go in there and drag them out.
Terrible I think it is, i think it's disgusting.
It's, well, it's lowering the standard of our people in Caerphilly.
# What you see, you can get #
# Nothing's free, nothing's said #
# Don't be fooled by the signs #
# Don't read in between the lines #
# What you're gonna say #
# What you're gonna do #
# Now you've missed out once again #
# But I thought you knew #
# Oh you silly thing #
# You've really gone and done it now #
# Oh you silly thing #
PROOF
AIRPORT
PISTOLS SACKED
JUST SUCKED
I should have known, it was a Rock 'N' Roll swindle all along.
Mclaren had spent a fucking long time with these record hippys.
It can't all have been breaking whiskey bottles over their bleedin' desks.
The deals were too good to be true.
I was sure ??Noel was there??, the freckled face cunt.
The Sex Pistols - a walking abortion.
The Sex Pistols are nothing but a bunch of irresponsible, half-dead lumps.
But the best are born.
I was only in it for the birds after the show.
You, Steve Jones, are nothing but a walking dildo doing a good plumbing job.
You'd swim through a river of snot, wade nostril deep through a mile of vomit, as long as you thought there was a sexy cunt at the end of it and those cunts!
Daddy's girl!
Daddy's girls are in awe of the Sex Pistols!
They really believe that what they're grooving on bores them to shit!
Daddy's girls are just hot water bottles with tits.
Why are they so fucking successful, the Sex Pistols?
And the Sex Pistols like death, it excites them sexually.
In the end, you see, it all comes down to one thing: they have a sort of negative Midas touch.
Everything they touch turns to shit!
I gota hand it to Malcolm, he certanly brought the punk out in me.
- Hi.
- Evening Malcolm.
I hope theres no guest list tonight, no record executives, remember, I don't want any journalists, none of those bloody vampires, just the kids.
You'll be away Malcolm.
Good enough, I'm gona pop in and have a beer.
They're jumping live in there tonight.
-Hi
-Alright!
Punkrockers, lesson 5.
How to steal as much money as quickly as possible from the record company of you choice, you dig it?
And here they are, 'Black Arabs'.
It was inevitable; disco.
Malcolm always was a hustler, he bought out a taty jet set dive in ol' Bond Street, makin' ends meet in the disco heat.
- Membership only tonight.
- I'm on the guest list.
- There's no guest list tonight.
- I wana see Malcolm.
- Malcolm who?
- Malcolm McLaren, you know who i mean.
- What's your name?
- Jones.
- Jones what?
- Steve.
- Ask Nolan if he knows Steve Jones?
Steve Jones? You want me to go right now?
Right now!
You hand on there.
- Hi
- In ya go son, straight away.
Right thereon the left.
Straight through straight on through there, goon then, enjoy yourselves, go on.
WHO KILLED BAMBI?
Next step is to get off the record label quick as possible give the record company any excuse but just make sure you ripped them off for as much money as you can.
Switch the groups misbehaviour in public, bullshit the record company, making them believe that you are an anarcist.
One week after EMI dumped the Sex
Pistols, A&M records picked them up.
And staged a contract signing ceremony in front of Buckingham Palace.
At this point, the Sex Pistols, despite having been fired, were not exactly suffering.
Before EMI could get rid of them, it had to buy off the contract, and that cost the company a reported L25.000.
And here they were signing a new contract that could make them a lot of money, and they already had a song to record for
A&M in honour of the Queens jubilee.
They did not record it, not at least for A&M records.
They never recorded anything for A&M.
Acording to the story, after this happy signing ceremony everyone went back to A&M offices to celebrate.

Push drugs, sex and any other stories to the papers, just make sure headlines are coming quick and fast.
You know, for my point of view, I feel that we're like some contageous disease.
You know that, eh, is totaly misunderstood.
I mean, when you walk in and out of a company, and the guy just gives you: "Look just take this money and don't come back"
What are you supposed to think about that?
Have you had the money?
Yes, they gave us the cheque last night.
And you couldn't - you didn't don't believe it was on, you couldnt..?
It just shows the hypocrisy, makes it very clear where their heads are at.
- Nowhere
- I was asking Malcolm earlier..
To give away that much money for nothing, classic stupidity
Ok, leave it to me.
..he dont want of his pals, come on!
What do you mean,?? he's my fucking manager.
- That's your problem! Come on.
- Don't fuck with me!
What do you mean,?? he's my fucking manager??
Now Get out!
You thought you'd gotten rid of us didn't you?
But you are old bean because were back, with a vengance.
God save the queen, my son!
LESSON 6:
- HOW TO BECOME THE WORLD'S
GREATEST TOURIST ATTRACTION? -
Helen, never trust a hippy.
Look for the current event, in our case we chose the jubilee.
And exploited it to the hilt.
If you play your cards right...
There's the tosspot mouthin' off again, up there.
You can capture the imagination of the entire world.
Ever get the feeling you're being trapped?
Banned on the land, we decided to play our tribute to the Queen, from the river.
Between the hours of 6 and 8 pm the Sex Pistols play their songs.
Beneath the bridges of London!
# God save the queen #
# The fascist regime #
# They made you a moron #
# Potential H-bomb #
# God save the queen #
# She ain't no human being #
# There is no future #
# In England's dreaming #
# Don't be told what you want
Don't be told what you need #
# There's no future, no future, #
# No future for you #
# God save the queen #
# We mean it man #
# We love our queen #
# God saves #
# God save the queen #
# 'Cause tourists are money #
# And our figurehead #
# Is not what she seems #
# Oh God save history #
# God save your mad parade #
# Oh Lord God have mercy #
# All crimes are paid #
# When there's no future
How can there be sin #
# We're the flowers in the dustbin #
# We're the poison in your human machine #
# We're the future, your future #
# God save the queen #
# We mean it man #
# We love our queen #
# God saves #
They arrested Malcolm!
# God save the queen #
# We mean it man #
# And there is no future #
# In England's dreaming #
# No future, #
# No future, #
# No future for you #
# No future, #
# No future, #
# No future for me #
# No future, #
# No future, #
# No future for you #
# No future, no future,
No future for me! #

The Sex Pistols' current record,
'God Save The Queen' is at number 1 at the capital hitline today, but the I.B.A. which administers
The Broadcasting Act, has advised us that particularly at this time, this record is likely to cause offense to a number of our listeners, and have asked us not to play it in our normal programming.
However, we will be playing this record, with the authorities approval, at 7:30pm tonight on
??Brian Wills open line??
And will welcome your views about the Punk
Rock phenomena, which this is part of.
# There's no point in asking, you'll get no reply #

It was amazing, you couldn't see this group play, you couldn't hear them on the radio.
If you wanted to buy the record it was impossible.
But yet this group had become the world greatest tourist atraction.
And was fast become
Englands public enemy number 1.
Instantly recognized wherever they went.
Literally prevented from walking the streets.
I Remember ol' Johnny, got cut up real bad, jumped by thugs.
God Save the Queen, eh, John?
Noel C??, when he came back home with his head all covered in blood.
I knew then that i'd really cracked it boy who was marvelous really.
# Look at that #
# Here she comes #
# Here comes that girl again #
# One of the cutest since
I don't know when #
# But she don't notice me when I pass #
# She goes with all the guys from outta my class #
# But that can't stop me from thinkin' to myself #
# She's sure fine lookin', man, she's something else #
# Look at that #
# 'Cross the street #
# There's a car built just for me #
# To own a car would be a luxury #
# But right now I can't afford the gas #
# A brand new convertible is out of my class #
# But that can't stop me from thinkin' to myself #
# That car's fine lookin', man, it's something else #
# Hey, look at that #
# Just wait and see #
# Worked hard and saved my dough #
# I buy that car and then
I roll up with Joe #
# Get me that girl and we go ridin' around #
# We look real sharp with the wide top down #
# I keep on dreamin' and thinkin' to myself #
# When it all comes true, man, that's something else #
# Hey, look at that #
# What's all this? #
# Never thought I'd do this before #
# But here I'm a-knockin' on her door #
# My car's out front and it's all mine #
# It's a '41 job not a '59 #
# I got that girl and I'm thinkin' to myself #
# She's sure fine lookin', man, she's something else #
It made sense,
McLaren had never stoped talking about that record convention in Hove.
They'll have more whip rounds than a pub crawl
And he's clean up with his fashionable rubber gear.
Now i find myself in a respectable backstreet off King's Cross Station,
Looking for the Cambridge Rapist Hotel.
Client number 1 was Mamie
Records boss, Ed Berg.
Awaiting trial on a child molesting charge.
I'd love to see him nailed, but i'd a funny feeling that either way he'd always get off.
I promised to sign a band a week.
And that's excatly what i'm gonna do.
Never mind the signing Mr Berg, where's Malcolm Mclaren then?
Mclaren?
He's never gonna work again.
The Sex Pistols are finished, over!
Yeah, they's filthy rich though aint they?
We don't take risks in this bussiness anymore.
We don't need to.
You dirty old man.
You were lucky last year, when we swallowed it.
I remember sitting at home with me wife and kids thinking it over.
What a fucking rotter.
Anarchy dropped out of the top 20.
It was dead.
Yeah, but where were you last night, Mr. Berg?
Did you bum it up with that new group you got, the Black Arabs?
Rock n roll can mean anything we want it to mean.
Peace and love, bringing people together, it can get rid of politics, it can be art, it's automatic, it's just the beat.
Big money, the normal promotion of records isn't fun.
Hello Judy.
I was getting no where fast, a chamber maid crossed my path.
I took it out on her, i don't know why, she couldn't talk if she tried.
Where is Malcolm? He owns the gaff dun he?
Every room was a dead end, i needed to relax.
# I'm left in misery, the girl I love's gone across the sea #
# I'm all alone,
I ain't got no home #
# Mandy was her name, sleepin' was her game #
# She didn't care about me, oh, God, baby can't you see #
# I'm a lonely boy. I'm a lonely boy. #
# I'm a lonely boy. I'm a lonely boy. #
# I need her tender touch, oh, I need it oh so much. #
# I'm a lonely boy. I'm a lonely boy. #
# I'm a lonely boy. I'm a lonely boy. #
# Oh my darlin' can't you see you're the one that means so much to me. #
# I know I need you're tender touch, oh, I need it oh so much.  #
By the way Steve, if you're looking for Malcolm, he'll be on the 6.15 out of Marylebone station.
- Sydney, this is the receiver speaking.
- Okay, ready to rock!
Thanks a lot.
# Well c'mon everybody and let's get together tonight #
Cor blimey, Jesus Christ
Helen what platform is it?
Platform three.
# But I'm gonna dance with three or four #
# And the house will be shakin' from the bare feet A-stampin' on the floor #
I'll see ya in a few minutes, i've just gotta do something.
# Well, we're really gonna party
But we gotta leave a guard outside #
OUT OF ORDER
LESSON 7
- CULTIVATE HATRED,
IT IS YOUR GRATEST ASSET -
Force the public to hate you.
Here at home, create a tour that no one can turn up to.
Throw the groups name away, and leave a question mark in its place.
Create confusion.
The Sex Pistols made sure that they failed to turn up at certain venues.
Spreading false rumours wherever they could.
# Ooh! C'mon everybody #
You know, we encouraged all those kids to travel all over the country without em never having the slightest chance of seeing the band play.
# Who cares? #
But above all we prevented the press from determining whether the band could actualy play.
And from questioning their now growing stature.
Well Helen, remember:
We were now a legend.
# Well c'mon everybody and let's get together tonight #
# I got some money in my jeans #
# And I'm really gonna spend it right #
# Well I've been doin' my homework all week long #
# Now to have some fifty and my folk are gone #
# Ooh! C'mon everybody #
- Isn't that Bill Jacobs?
- No.
LESSON 8
HOW TO DIVERSITY YOUR BUSINESS...
WHAT A BUSINESS.
I got an important gig tonight, i want to be alone.
Momy, Momy, come quick someones killed Bambi!
Step on it, Byron.
We got a plane to catch at Hindley airport.
Why remain just a Rock N Roll star?
Malcolm! Open up!
You don't just have a group that can't play.
You also have four actors that cant act.
What do you mean i cant act?
Don't think in tens, think in hundreds and thousends of pounds.
Come out of your closet.
We opened officed and bank accounts overseas, now worldwide organizations, it was difficult to avoid the temptation of working with criminals enganged in embezzling huge sums of money from international corporations.
But i much say their expertise really took our film investers for a ride.
So simple, collecting thousands of pounds of cash each week from our record company on the basis of a script that was so disgusting it just couldn't possibly be made.
Who killed bambi?
I kept my mouth shut, collected L250,000.
Having got a fortune for doing nothing, the final problem was how to enjoy it.
And get out of this stupid rock n roll circus.
Eventualy, we signed to the Americans.
For more money, than all the other record companies put together.
These bloody barbarians who invented rock n roll were naturally curious about what the Sex Pistols were all about and wanted their image exposed accross the whole united states.
Initially i admit i didnt want to go, we were sloppy and abusive in our applications at the embassy ensuring that the Visas would be refused,
Bob Carter was in poland and those damn hippies were demanding freedom of speech.
Nobody better than us anyway.
Except for The Eagles, The
Eagles are better than us.
The idea was to get lost in the swamps and the badlands, making it impossible for the legend to be unmasked.
Life is so intensely profound you know like the Sex Pistols are they just, their lyrics and everything about them is so deep you can just really get into them.
One, two, three, four!
Cheap holiday in other people's misery.
# I don't wanna holiday in the sun #
# I wanna go to new Belsen #
# I wanna see some history #
# 'Cause now I got a reasonable economy #
# Now I got a reason, now I got a reason #
# Now I got a reason and I'm still waiting #
# Now I got a reason #
# Now I got reason to be waiting #
# The Berlin Wall #
If this is what the american youth look up to, if this is what they believe in, then we are in sad shape.
# So bad #
# Be a man #
# Join the army #
# Kill someone #
# Kill yourself #
# Kill someone #
# Join the army #
# Kill yourself #
# Be a man. #
# A real man. #
# A Hero. #
Faggots!
- Leave him alone you bastards!
Leave him alone!
As far as i'm concerned, they're not worth killing.
I just came up and upset the bass player because i knew that he knew that i meant physical harm.
And i have to say that I was ugly about it.
But he came out and hit us over the head with a bass.
# It's not funny, there's no fun #
# Head being alone, no fun! #
# Noooo Fuuuuun! #
# No Fuuuun! #
# No Fuuuuuuuuuuun! #
# No Fuun! No Fuuun! #
Our cover was blown.
For the first time our publicity had worked against us.
We had become the most important name after the president of the United States.
And that night, in Winterland, in San Francisco.
The Sex Pistols played to the whole world.
It wasn't a rock n roll party.
Was more like a dying horse that needed putting out of its misery.
We raised that horses head and choked the living daylights out of it.
Ever get the feeling you're been cheated?
Jesus, Byron! Is this it?
This is it Malcolm.
Hindley airfield.
Battle of Britain station.
- Take off in 10 minutes Malcolm.
- Alright.
LESSON 9
WHO KILLED BAMBI?
Oi, can you stop here please, i want to see Malcolm fly away.
Haven't seen you since our second sacking.
Good afternoon.
Why did the Sex Pistols break up on the brink of being a successful rock n roll band?
Why?
Because we seized our chance in
San Francisco to frame our singer, leaving him with the contracts and us with the money.
Johnny Rotten claims that he's been fired from the group? Is that true?
Yes it is, but let me first explain.
In order to gain everything, you have to sarcrifice something.
In America, our record company was working inside our camp.
Encouraging Johnny Rotten's pretensions as some rock n roll superstar.
We let them and they lapped it up of course.
But eventualy he started working for the other side.
And what do you call people like that in your country, monsieur?
Collaborators.
- How much has been made out all this?
- What? Can't hear yah.
How much money has been made out of all this?
So far my secretary said it was L779,000.
I have no idea, and i don't give a shit about the Americans.
Sure, and just how far have you gone in planning this whole afair?
Ever since i was 10 years old.
Ever since Elvis Presley joined the army!
In the minds of the Sex Pistols would you say that Punk Rock is finally dead.
Haha, that's the most laughable question i've heard this year.
Who killed Bambi?
Bollocks!
He left the country in a light aircraft.
The film had better be good Malcolm, or i give you a good fucking kicking when you get back.
# Gentle pretty thing
Who only had one spring #
# You bravely faced the world
Ready for anything #
# I'm happy that you lived
For your life is mine #
# What have I except to cry
Spirit never die #
# Birds of the air
Beasts of the earth #
# Overjoyed at Bambi's birth they gambolled in the glade #
# Who killed Bambi? Who killed Bambi? #
# Who killed Bambi? Who killed Bambi? #
# Who killed Bambi? Who killed Bambi? #
# Who killed Bambi? #
Excuse me!
Hold up? humphrey?
Why on earth are we going to see the Sex Pistols film.
I let to see pogo dance, very good.
We just look.
You my friend, everything they want.
# Who killed Bambi?

The sinking ship of rock n roll is going to have a tough task recovering for the terminal body blow dealt it by the sex pistols.
These four, unloveable spiky tops, swindle their way to the top.
They didn't care about the music.
They were purly into chaos.
Across the globe they achieved a notority in 19 languages.
On fleet street they sold more papers than the armistice.
In the city voted young bussinessman of the year by the investers review.
Yes, 1977 and the four sex pistols had never had it so good.
All this, a number 1 album, four hit singeles; but then.
Sid Vicious - hospitalized.
Johnny Rotten - fired.
Punk Rock became a new wave for Paul Cook and Steve Jones, it had to be Brasil.
Europe's more wanted man the great train robber Ronnie Biggs!
Jesus!
See that, it's me!
Gee i'd really fancy a Sex Pistol.
Halo, who is it?
Weve come to see. Open up.
Ere, who is this an army ariving?
Hold on.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- You're the Sex Pistols are ya?
- There you are.
You don't look anything like Johnny Rotten.
Don't fucking want to!
You know, if you didn't swear like that you could be another Spencer Tracy.
I supose you want to ask the famous question, where's all the money?
- Where is it?
- Where is it all?
I done it down the boozer, didn't i?
How much did you get away with then, all together?
Two and a half million.
Were on our way were on our way...
We'll soon be up with ya.
How much have you made?
Well weve got ***, you didnt get any
- Crime is strickly for mugs.
- Yes.
Get in to the pop word, thats the thing to do.
Don't go round nicking bike and things like that, get yourself a guitar the honest way.
Legaly, or whatever.
This one looks so fit now, she looks like a cat burglar or something.
- I dont believe that
- Oh no no no!
-  Nobody believe it until they see me.
- What ** the cambridge rapist.
A Cheap holiday in other peoples misery!

- Sit down!
Come on! Come on Mary, this ... thanks i've eaten already!
See that, i wernt just a sex pistol, i was the one who started it.
Come down here, i'll tell ya what it was all about.
Le importa pedir permiso !
- Toma una hamburguesa, yo invito.
How did you have so much success?
We used to nick all our gear in the beginning.
We didnt have, we didnt have enough money to pay for it so we used to nick it off people like David Bowie.
How did, how did you manage to... would you like to, sort of, give me some information exactly how you used to steal, id very very interested as a professional
What was your first job as a crook?
As a crook? Woolworths.
Woolworths?
- What did you do in Woolworths?
- Pens and pencils.
- Pens and pencils?
- No rubbers?
Okay, don't use rubbers presumably?
How much bread did you get from EMI?
Bout, ú55,000 publishing fee.
Get together and start composing some music
If i wrote the words for example, would you possibly write the music?
Yeah easy.

ON SALE IN THE FOYER NOW
If you like their pop music, you love their pop-corn.
It's pure punk.
Remember, how Johnny got his name?
Prise out your fillings on a chewy rotten bar.
Thirsty for a change?
Quench it with Anarkee-ora.
Feeling uptight, violent or tense?
Why not take it out on a sizzling vicious burger?
The gristle bowl that gives as good as it gets.
Oh! Sidney Vicious!
What? What? What you want?
You want some of that?
- Sid Vicious, es un hombre maravilloso.
What a wonderful fool, never have i met one like him.
Hey Steve, how did you get thrown off A&M?
Was it for beating up Bob Harris?
Did Sid do that?
I raped one of the birds down their offices.
- Sex Pistol!
- You fucking want you cunt?
Pack it in you two, you're annoying our clientele.
Oi, Tadpole. Wake up!
You'll have to go in theredear, it's getting a bit much, i can't cope.
Sid Vicious now waiting trial for murder, we talk to him and examine the system that has perhaps destroyed him.
Here, it's Sid Vicious has been arrested.
And not before time, you coming?
Ladies and gentlemen, i have the honor to present to you, for the first time in France,
Sid Vicious.
I can't believe it's my Sid, up there.
# And now, the end is near #
# And so I face the final curtain #
# You cunt, I'm not a queer #
# I'll state my case of which I'm certain #
# I've lived a life that's full #
# And each and every highway #
# And that, much more than this #
# I did it my way #
# Regrets I've had a few #
# But then again, too few to mention #
# I did what I had to do #
# I saw it through without exemption #
# I've planned each charted course #
# Each careful step along the highway #
# And more, much more than this #
# I did it my way #
# There were times, #
# I'm sure you knew #
# When there was fuck, fuck #
# Fuck all else to do #
# But through it all, #
# When there was doubt #
# I shot it up #
# or kicked it out #
# I faced 'em all and the world #
# And did it my way #
# I've loved and been a snide #
# I've had my fill, my share of losing #
# And now the tears subside #
# I find it all so amusing #
# To think, I killed a cat #
# And might I say not in the die way #
# Oh no, oh no, not me #
# I did it my way #
# For what is a brat, #
# What has he got #
# When he wears hats and he cannot #
# Say the things he truly feels #
# But only the words #
# Of one who kneels #
# The record shows, #
# I've stuffed a bloke #
# And did it my way #
# It was on the good ship Venus
By Christ, you should've seen us #
# The figurehead was a whore in bed
And the mast was a mammoth penis. #
# The captain of this lugger
He was a dirty bugger #
# He wasn't fit to shovel shit
From one place to another #
# Friggin' in the riggin'
Friggin' in the riggin' #
# Friggin' in the riggin'
There was fuck all else to do  #
# The captain's name was Morgan
By Christ, he was a gorgon #
# Ten times a day sweet tunes he'd play
On his fucking organ #
# The first mate's name was Cooper
By Christ he was a trooper.
# He jerked and jerked until he worked
Himself into a stupor #
# Friggin' in the riggin'
Friggin' in the riggin' #
# Friggin' in the riggin'
There was fuck all else to do #
# The second mate was Andy
By Christ, he had a dandy #
# Till they crushed his cock with a jagged rock For cumming in the brandy #
# The cabin boy was Flipper
He was a fucking nipper #
# He stuffed his ass with broken glass

VICIOUS FACES
MURDER COURT
VICIOUS HELD FOR MURDER
DRUGS KILL PUNK STAR
SID VICIOUS
SID VICIOUS DEAD
Iwas kind of a strange child.
My parents knew early on that something was wrong with me.
I crawled backwards until I was two... but had Kennedy's inaugural address memorized by the time I was six.
It all began when my mother didn't show up for my first birthday party... because she was having my sister.
My dad tried to cheer me up by letting me eat the whole cake.
I knew then there had to be more to life than this.
When I was a kid, I thought only three people worked for General Motors:
Pat Boone, Dinah Shore and my dad.
Our hometown of Flint, Michigan, was the birthplace of General Motors... the largest corporation in the world.
There were more auto factories and workers here than in any city on Earth.
We built Cadillacs, Buicks, and Fisher bodies...
GM trucks, Chevrolets, and AC spark plugs.
We enjoyed a prosperity that working people had never seen.
And the city was grateful to the company.
With the whole city rocking,
Flint, Michigan, throws a birthday party.
It's for the people of General Motors on their 50th anniversary.
Pat Boone celebrates with a song.
The promise of the future is the keynote set by GM President, Harlow Curtis.
From the world of TV comes Sergeant Garcia... and the swordsman known as Zorro.
But the big hit of the parade... is the lively marching of the Elks junior drill team.
The citizens of Flint, birthplace of General Motors... also see the radiant Miss America.
This was Flint as I remember, where every day was a great day.
It's a great day, all right.
A salute to Mr. And Mrs. America.
My dad worked on the assembly line at
GM's AC Spark Plug in Flint for 33 years.
In fact, as I grew older, I discovered my entire family had worked for GM: grandparents, parents, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, cousins. Everyone but me.
My uncle Laverne was in the Great Flint Sit-Down Strike.
Just hours before the year's end in 1936... he and thousands of other GM workers took over the Flint factories... and barricaded themselves inside, refusing to budge for 44 days.
The National Guard was called in, and the eyes of the world were on Flint.
On February 1 1, 1937,
General Motors gave in... and the UAW was born.
The GM employee has made great advances.
It is our wish that he continue to prosper.
Most of our employees, even those who at times cause problems... are conscientious and hardworking men and women.
Men and women to whose imagination, ingenuity, energy and dedication... our country owes its industrial leadership in the world.
That all sounded fine and good, but the assembly line wasn't for me.
My heroes were the Flint people who'd escaped the life in the factory... and got out of Flint, like the guys in Grand Funk Railroad...
Casey Kasem, the women who married
Zubin Mehta and Don Knotts... and perhaps Flint's most famous native son, Bob Eubanks... host of TV's hit show
The Newlywed Game.
I figured if Bob Eubanks could make it out of here, so could I.
After 10 years of editing my own paper in Flint... a California millionaire asked me to be the editor... of his muckraking magazine in San Francisco.
It didn't take me long to figure out what to do.
The final issue of the Michigan Voice is being printed.
Ten years after he began it, Michael Moore is moving to San Francisco.
What would you do?
I mean, this was San Francisco.
But San Francisco was on the other side of the world from Flint.
Everyone there had a job, yet no one seemed to be working.
The cafés were filled with people at 3:00 p.m.
I was told there's one restaurant for every 44 people in San Francisco... but most of them seemed to be dessert places.
Trying to get a simple cup of coffee became a nightmare for me.
Espresso, double espresso, cappuccino, double cappuccino...
Iatte, double latte, mocha, double mocha... caffe con panna, macchiato, double macchiato... caffe bianco, or house blend.
I was feeling disoriented living in a town that didn't carry any nondairy creamer.
I went to work and announced... that I was going to give a monthly column to a Flint auto worker.
The owner instead told me to run an investigative report on herbal teas.
I told him I had a better idea:
Let's put the auto worker on the cover.
The owner wasn't amused and declared that California and I were a mismatch... just before he offered me my free U-Haul back to Michigan.
-Hello, Dad.
-Hello, son.
-It's been a long time.
-lt sure has.
-Where's Mom?
-ln the kitchen.
Why, your hands are filthy!
-Go upstairs and wash them.
-Okay, Mom.
Okay, so my homecoming wasn't quite like that.
In fact, I wasn't back in Flint more than a few days when the bad news hit.
This is the CBS Evening News,
Dan Rather reporting.
Good evening.
General Motors confirmed it today.
It is going to close plants employing almost 30,000 workers.
Today we are announcing the closing... of 1 1 of our older plants.
While Detroit and Pontiac will certainly be hurt by the shutdowns... the effect on Flint is absolutely devastating.
Devastating wasn't the half of it.
Maybe I got this wrong... but I thought companies lay off people when they hit hard times.
GM was the richest company in the world... and it was closing factories when it was making profits in the billions.
We do not have any plan to cut our workforce by 80,000.
That was kind of a what-happens-if type of thing.
So this was GM chairman Roger Smith.
He appeared to have a brilliant plan:
First close 1 1 factories in the U.S... then open 1 1 in Mexico, where you pay the workers 70 cents an hour.
Use the money you saved by building cars in Mexico to take over other companies... preferably high-tech firms and weapons manufacturers.
Next, tell the union you're broke... and they happily give back a couple of billion dollars in wage cuts.
Then take that money from workers... and eliminate their jobs by building more foreign factories.
Roger Smith was a true genius.
I think our employees have got a new emphasis on job security... and we want to try and help them with that.
-What do you have to say to Roger Smith?
-It's gonna be rough.
I can't mention it on television.
This was to be the first of many layoffs in Flint... the final day for the GM truck plant.
I think most of you are aware... that this is the first major plant closing... to take place in Flint.
Let me rephrase that.
This isn't a plant closing.
It's a loss of one product line.
My friends and I decided to pose as a TV crew from Toledo... to sneak inside the factory.
I wasn't exactly sure what a TV crew from Toledo looked like... but apparently the ruse worked, as we filmed the last truck going down the line.
What's everybody so happy about?
We just lost our jobs.
Everybody's applauding.
They just lost their jobs.
We're trying impress upon the employees that are being laid off... that there is nothing out there for them... to depend upon for the future.
The best thing Michigan and GM can do is get rid of Roger Smith... and them other sons of bitches.
That seemed to be the general consensus... as I talked to many GM workers about their chairman, Roger Smith.
-What would you like to tell Roger Smith?
-I'd tell him to retire.
He can't look an auto worker in the eye, because....
-He should be feeling guilty.
-Most people are hungry. He's not.
I'd tell him to get off his big bucks... and start giving some of it back to its workers.
I'm sick and tired of these damn fat cats.
I could say a few choice words, but I'm a lady and I was raised a lady... so I won't say what I really feel... but I could use some unsavory language as far as the fat cats.
Fire Roger Smith!
There were those who had a different opinion in Flint...
Iike Tom Kay, a spokesman and lobbyist for GM.
I'm sure that Roger Smith... has a social conscience as strong as anybody else in the country.
Because a guy is an automobile executive does not make him inhuman.
I've talked to enough of them.
I know what their concerns are.
He has as much concern about these people as you or I do... and nobody likes to see anybody laid off or put in a hardship situation.
-Have you ever talked to Roger Smith?
-Sure.
What kind of man do you find him to be?
A very warm man. I have....
A warm man?
Did I have Roger Smith judged all wrong... simply because he was eliminating
30,000 jobs from my hometown?
I decided to find out.
I wrote. I phoned. I faxed. I tried every means of communication available... but nothing got me any closer to Roger.
I was left with no choice.
I got in the car and drove about an hour south of Flint to Detroit... to the world headquarters of General Motors.
My mission was a simple one: to convince Roger Smith to spend a day with me in Flint... and meet some of the people who were losing their jobs.
Everybody in?
-Can I help you gentlemen and ladies?
-Yes, we're going to the 14th floor.
-Do you have an appointment?
-No, we don't.
-I think you need an appointment.
-To go up there?
-How can we make one?
-You want to step out....
-First of all, anything above--
-We came down from Flint.
Anything above the first level here is private property. That's off-limits.
-This is all off-limits. It's a security area.
-This is? All right.
Listen, who did you want to talk to?
-I want to talk to Roger Smith.
-I'll get a PR man and we'll see.
-What kind of movie are you making?
-It's a documentary on Flint.
On the labor problems?
The whole situation, the plant shutdowns, the layoffs.
We'll try to have someone contact you as soon as someone's available.
-All right, I'd appreciate it.
-Have you got some kind of credentials?
-Where they can contact you?
-What's your name?
Herb Slaughter.
I'll give you a business card.
Let's see, I've got a frequent-flier card...
Visa....
I was having a hard time finding my business card, because I don't have any.
So I gave Mr. Slaughter my discount pass to Chuck E. Cheese... but he said that wouldn't get me in to see Mr. Smith.
So I headed back to Flint for further guidance from GM lobbyist Tom Kay.
General Motors wouldn't be doing anybody any service if it goes bankrupt.
It has to do what it has to do... in order to stay competitive in today's economic climate.
Even if it means eliminating 18,000 jobs?
Even if it means eliminating 20,000 jobs.
-Or 30,000?
-Whatever.
How about all the jobs here in Flint?
It could feasibly happen.
Good evening, I'm Sue Zelenko.
Bill Harris has the night off.
It was where the UAW was born.
Tonight 3,000 people are trying to decide what to do with their lives.
Nobody was ready for the announced plant shutdowns today...
Ieast of all, the 1,350 workers.
The last truck chassis headed down the line this morning.
Virtually all the 3,400 people are on layoff.
Larry Elliot was at the plant today... as that last car was making its way down the assembly line.
Will this plant build engines again if the rush back to small cars occurs?
The answer is no.
In Flint, Joe Weaver,
Channel 2 Eyewitness News.
More factories had closed... and I began to see the effect this was having on my friends.
Ben was the worker I'd put on the cover of that magazine in San Francisco.
He'd been laid off five times in five years from GM.
Expecting to be laid off again, he cracked one night working on the assembly line.
He was now shooting hoop at the local mental health center.
I couldn't take it. I told the guy next to me:
"Tell the foreman I'm sick.
I don't give a shit what you tell him."
I grabbed my coat, flew out the door, passed the guards... jumped into my car, got onto Bristol Road... and was flying toward my apartment.
I turned on the radio, hoping that might cheer me up...
I had tears coming out of my eyes... and I strike right into the middle of Wouldn't It Be Nice by The Beach Boys.
And I'm thinking, "What a horrible song...
"to have to hear in the midst of this panic attack."
A song that I'd usually get a groove going with.
I'm trying to sing the lyrics, and I've got an apple in my throat.
I'm trying to rationalize with those lyrics... trying to think, "Wouldn't it be nice?"
And it just wasn't working.
Some disturbing news today from the Genesee County Health Department.
It announced the rat population in Flint... has now surpassed the human population by 50,000.
Health officials say it's due to massive numbers of people leaving... and the city cutting back to twice-monthly garbage collection... due to budget constraints.
Just when things were looking bleak,
Ronald Reagan arrived in Flint... and took a dozen unemployed workers out for a pizza.
He told them he had a great idea.
If they tried it, they'd all be working again.
He suggested that maybe some of us... could find better jobs elsewhere...
Iike in Texas, or in the southern states.
That's when I spoke up... because I have a son, a home.
I'm trying to do it by myself. I can't just pull up stakes and take off by myself.
We don't hold public office, we're nobody special... but he wanted our opinions and views.
It was at a level I could understand, and I liked his ideas... that he voiced to us.
None of Reagan's luncheon guests got back into the factory in later years.
The only bright spot of the whole affair... was the individual who borrowed the restaurant's cash register... on the way out the door.
Meanwhile, Flint's more fortunate were holding their annual Great Gatsby Party... at the home of one of GM's founding families.
To show they weren't totally insensitive to the plight of others... they hired local people to be human statues at the party.
What's it like in Flint these days?
Things are tough here for the people that are laid off.
There's still people working.
I don't think it's as bad as people may believe.
We started something, and we're gonna finish it.
-We're gonna be the leaders.
-What did we start?
We started the industrial revolution... an art form that's never been created in the history of mankind.
-What was that industrial revolution?
-The cars. Steel.
It took off from there.
We invented the wheel again.
We're off again and running.
What advice do you have for those having a rough go of it?
Get up in the morning and go do something.
Start yourself. Get your own motor going.
There's things to do out there.
I don't think it's fair to pick on the negative things and publicize them... and not pick up any of the good aspects about Flint.
What are some of those good aspects?
-The ballet. Your kids were involved in it.
-Ballet. Hockey. It's a great place to live.
Sheriff's department. Anybody home?
Hello?
I had found one man in Flint with a secure job: sheriff's deputy Fred Ross.
I treat a person the way I would like to be treated.
You know, I explain to them that I got a job to do.
The court issued the order, not me.
If you can make peace with your landlord, good.
If you can't, you've got a problem.
I've put out some good people.
You have a lot of people in this town paying $800 to $900 a month house note.
That's a lot of money to try to pay on unemployment.
Some of these people don't want to leave... especially older people.
Some of them have retired from the shop.
Taxes catch a lot of them, too.
So if things go down, they close up some plants here... this town is gonna be a rough place.
I continued my search for Roger.
I scoured the neighborhoods of Grosse Pointe, Grosse Pointe Woods...
Grosse Pointe Farms, Grosse Pointe Park...
Grosse Pointe Shores, and Bloomfield Hills.
I tried in vain to locate his house... but the name Smith was a common one among these people.
I then read that Roger was going to be at the Grosse Pointe Yacht Club.
I decided to drop in on the affair.
I haven't seen him.
-You haven't seen him here yet?
-Just a moment.
-Are you calling him?
-Who, Roger Smith?
You want me to call Roger Smith?
I'm trying to get the manager to see if anybody knows anything about him.
I'm sure he said the Grosse Pointe.
I mean it wasn't him--
Who, his office?
-Why don't we call his office and find out?
-We could do that.
I have a television crew down here with Michael Moore.
He's supposed to meet Roger Smith at noon. I have no information.
How often does Mr. Smith come here for lunch or dinner?
Last time I saw him here was for Sportsmen's Night.
-What's that?
-It's a wild game dinner.
-You go and shoot your own animal?
-Pardon me?
You go and shoot your animals and bring them here to eat--
Some of the stuff is donated.
There are foods like rattlesnake....
Let me think of some real exotic foods.
Alligator.
-You eat this stuff here?
-Roast beef.
That sounds better.
I obviously had the wrong yacht club, because Roger was nowhere to be found.
I didn't have more time to waste here, because back at Flint's county fair... thousands of people were being entertained by the diving donkeys... anxiously awaiting the return of our boyhood hero... as he made his triumphant return home to Flint.
From Genesee County Fair, the newlywed capital of the world... here come the newlyweds!
A big hand. This is your part....
There they come.
Yes, it's The Newlywed Game... and these are our newlywed couples for today.
Let's all meet the host and star of The Newlywed Game:
Bob Eubanks!
Hello, everybody. Welcome.
How nice of you to come here today.
Welcome to the opening of....
Hi, Mom. How are you doing?
You devil, you!
What about questions like,
"How heavy are your wife's breasts?"
I never ask that. I say,
"What does your wife's chest weigh?"
There's a lot of difference in that question you just asked....
A hell of a lot of difference.
That's where I think we get a bad rap.
People like yourself will quote a question like that.
I wouldn't ask that question for anything.
I wouldn't even say "breasts."
First question. These are easy questions.
Ladies, how much did your husband say your chest weighs?
-Gladys, what do you say, sweetheart?
-Two pounds.
Two pounds!
He said six-and-a-half ounces.
I said, "Both of them."
He said, "That is both of them."
I said, "I'm sorry."
He said, "Not as sorry as I am."
Bob was right. He didn't say "breasts " and I considered apologizing... for implying that his show wasn't wholesome family entertainment.
You know why
Jewish women don't get AlDS?
Because they marry assholes, they don't screw them. Pardon me.
Ladies and gentlemen, that's all for this afternoon.
If I made you smile one time, I'm happy.
I had a good time. I hope you did, too.
Until next time.
We'll be back every night....
I'm Bob Eubanks. So long, everybody.
See you then.
I was born here in Flint, but I don't know anything about it.
I can only tell you this about this town:
It's pretty... and the people are nice.
I don't know much about the economy, but I can take you to places in the U.S... much worse off than Flint, Michigan.
I don't think it's such a bad town.
With 30,000 jobs now eliminated, the city decided to turn to the one event... that had always made us so happy: the big parade... this time honoring the surviving
Flint Sit-Down Strikers.
The highlight of the parade was Miss Michigan, Kaye Lani Rae Rafko.
Passing by dozens of boarded-up stores and hundreds of jobless Flint citizens... she was an inspiring sight to all present.
How do you feel about the economy in Flint?
The factories all shutting down?
This isn't my interview yet.
This is my time for enjoyment.
All kinds of important people showed up to march in the parade...
Iike the governor of Michigan,
James Blanchard.
How do you feel about General Motors closing up these factories in Flint?
It's tragic.
Do you think we need another sit-down strike?
That won't do any good.
That's the problem.
Is this a great time for a parade?
I think so, too. Let's have a fun time!
Give your life to Jesus today.
Jesus Christ loves you.
Give your life to Jesus.
Tell your viewers they need Jesus!
Give your life to Jesus.
How could you have a parade for the founders... without inviting the current president of the United Auto Workers, Owen Bieber?
I don't know that we need another sit-down strike per se.
A sit-down strike today would not necessarily resemble... or be able to bring about the same thing that it did in 1937.
The union is getting weaker.
We're losing power.
Why? Because there's too many guys in the union... that are friends with the management.
Some plants that are announced to be closed obviously will be closed.
We have to accept the reality that they're just not going to remain open.
I think that with the spirit here...
Flint will continue not only to survive, but will continue to grow.
Some people know what time it is.
Some people don't.
Miss Michigan, could we talk to you for one second?
Your face looks familiar. Was this when you caught me on the road?
Yes, back in the parade. How does it feel driving through Flint, Michigan, today... and so many people being laid off, so many plants being shut down?
-How does it feel? I feel like a supporter.
-Of?
-Does it matter of what?
-A supporter of General Motors?
Of just being here for the people.
Is it the parade?
When you pass stores that are boarded-up and people that are laid off... how does that make you feel on a personal level?
A little sad.
Of course, I'm for employment... and working in Michigan.
And, hopefully, it's just temporarily.
So, I just keep my fingers crossed that they'll be back working soon.
I'm trying to stay neutral. I'm going to
Miss America in two weeks, and I don't....
-It's a great day for a parade, isn't it?
-It's beautiful. I can't believe the crowd.
It's the largest parade I've been in... and I've been in over 20 since June.
It's wonderful. I love coming back to Flint.
It's my third trip here, and I love it.
Any message to the people of Flint?
Keep your fingers crossed for me as I go for the gold in two weeks... and hopefully bring back a crown for Flint and the Michigan state.
Two weeks later, she got her wish.
Our new Miss America...
Kaye Lani Rae Rafko, Miss Michigan!
This is probably Number 15
I've been here and evicted someone.
-From this house?
-Yes.
Daryl? Sheriff's department.
Get your clothes on.
We're here to put you out.
-Here to do what?
-Evict you from the house. Right now.
People stay up all night and sleep all day.
Deputy Fred seemed especially busy these days.
After doing 24 evictions in one day... he arrived to evict a woman who was a month behind in her rent.
She quickly got the landlord on the phone.
After telling him that a film crew had arrived with the sheriff... the landlord told Fred not to evict the woman and her children.
It had leaked so much, this whole area was bulging down.
My oldest son.... I moved his bed,
I was scared the ceiling would fall.
But nobody was there at the time it fell.
It needed to be painted outside.
The aluminum siding outside, I put on.
I paid for it and had it put on.
See my new siding? It does look better.
You put that on since last time I was here.
You've spent a lot of money.
It looked like the raggediest house on the block.
These houses look nice and I was embarrassed about it.
The deal was pretty good, so I worked with it.
-What will happen to this woman?
-End up putting her out... unless her new husband comes up with the money.
I can't imagine somebody getting married to someone as poor as you.
It gets kind of rough.
Put two poor people in the same house....
I always tell women, "You can be poor by yourself, you don't need help."
And she just got some help being poor.
Three days later,
Fred put the woman and her kids out.
-Hi, can I help you?
-We're looking for Roger Smith.
We're wondering if he's here.
I have no idea if he's here or not, but you'll have to leave the club.
-Why's that?
-It's a private club.
-Has he been here today?
-To my knowledge, he has not.
-Does he come here often?
-I really don't know.
-ls he a member here?
-He is a member.
But you don't know if he's been here?
We don't keep track of our membership.
You'll have to leave the club, sir.
-lt is a private building.
-You'd know if he--
-Sir, we'll have to ask you to leave.
-I just want to find out--
Sorry, you'll have to leave the club.
Call General Motors. Check with them.
We have called GM. We can't get in there.
If you can't get in there, you can't get in here. Would you mind leaving?
-We could just wait.
-No, you can't.
They say you must leave the building, sir.
You have to step outside.
We'll come back.
I'll be right here.
They told me to take you outside.
You may wait outside. If he comes in, you can interview him outside.
You may not interview him in here.
You don't remember the last time he was here?
-That means nothing.
-When the chairman of GM is in here?
That doesn't impress me.
It doesn't impress you?
The chairman of GM?
The chairman of General Motors is just another member of our organization.
He's an important individual, but no more important than any other member.
I wasn't having much success bringing Roger to Flint.
The mayor, though, was having better luck with an even higher authority.
He paid TV evangelist
Robert Schuller $20,000... to come to Flint and rid the city of its unemployment plague.
Tough times don't last, but tough people do.
Thousands filled the city's hockey arena to hear his message of hope.
Pull your way out of poverty!
You won't pull your way from poverty to prosperity... until you realize you have to be humble enough to say, "I need help. "
By then what happens is you can turn your hurt into a halo.
The sorrow becomes a servant.
Just because you've got problems... is no excuse to be unhappy.
Maybe Reverend Schuller was right.
Things could be worse, and there was much to be thankful for...
Iike the Star Theatre of Flint... funded with GM money to provide entertainment and escape... during Flint's hard times.
Buick City, this is called.
Rednecks, hardhat automotive workers.
We bring Broadway and the theater to them... in this beautiful edifice.
But that takes money, time, effort, energy.
Bobby Vinton opened our season.
It was 90 percent sold out. It was a big hit.
He has charisma. Came into the audience, spent about 15 minutes with them... fussing with the ladies, kissing, and they loved him.
He got standing ovations every night.
Peggy Lee came.
She wasn't the greatest hit.
But she had her cult from surrounding areas.
Her cult love her.
Those who came absolutely loved her.
Standing ovations, bravos, cheers....
They were crazy about her.
Last year, Mitzi Gaynor came here with her show.
She brings 10 wonderful boy dancers with her.
She makes 16 changes. The boys make 14.
When they're on, she's off.
She's on, they're off, changing costumes.
One production number after another.
You'd be surprised. Some of those hard-hat factory workers say, "Hey! "
They present their badge or identification, so they can come at a half-price ticket... to keep them coming when they're having hard times.
Long before she sold orange juice...
Anita Bryant sold spark plugs for General Motors' AC division.
She used to perform for General Motors when I was a child.
I remember her carrying around a giant spark plug... and singing You'll Never Walk Alone.
Now she was back in Flint, offering advice to the unemployed.
Opportunities are still in Flint, Michigan.
They're still in America.
Hang in there. Take a day at a time.
Go forward and be positive about life.
Don't feel regretful or guilty about the past, or worry about the future.
You have today. Today's a new day.
It's an opportunity for you to look about you... and look at the positive within yourself and within your community.
I read something interesting.
Margaret Thatcher says:
"Cheer up, America.
You live in a great country.
"You're a free country.
You have a great President.
"Not everything's perfect, but cheer up, because you live in a free America."
So, we live in a free society.
Today is a new day, an opportunity to do something with yourself.
If nothing else, thank God for the sunshine... and for the fact that you're not starving to death.
Go out and do something with your hands.
I don't know.
Flint is bedrock America.
People here don't quit or give up.
They know there've been many good times in the past, and there's more... of good, productive time ahead.
It was like I was reliving my childhood.
First Anita, and now "Mr. Chevrolet" himself.
Pat Boone had arrived in Flint just when we needed him.
I look the same.
I liked you the moment I saw you.
More people identified me with Chevrolet... than any other sponsor, and any other spokesman.
Since my family was getting bigger, we were having a baby a year...
I needed a station wagon.
So each year I worked for Chevrolet...
I had a Corvette and a station wagon to use.
That strengthened my feeling that this was a great sponsor and a great product... which I could whole-heartedly endorse on television, and did.
Take a look at Chevrolet's '58 Corvette.
What a beauty!
I own and drive one of these myself.
I can vouch for them.
The sweetest-handling baby on the road today.
Chevrolet's completely new in style.
It's the longest, too.
Have you ever met Roger Smith, the chairman of General Motors?
I haven't. At least, I don't think I have.
If I had, it would have been before he was chairman... years ago, during my involvement.
I don't think we've met.
So you don't know much about him?
I don't know much about him. He seems to be a very optimistic, can-do kind of guy.
He's not a quitter.
I knew you'd rather have a Buick.
See you later.
Who's to blame for what's happened in Flint?
I don't think it's anybody's fault.
In a free society, in a capitalistic, democratic society... things do change.
There are shifts and trends.
I'm sure General Motors doesn't have any desire... to either close down a plant or put people out of work.
The key becomes the attitude.
Folks wind up saying, "lt was the best thing that happened to me...
"when my job at the plant phased out.
I was only gonna go so far at the plant.
"Now I've got my own business, whatever it is."
It's maybe no accident... that the Amway business, for one, is in aid of Michigan... offering anybody, for very little money, a chance to start earning dollars... having their own store in their home.
If you have a dream, and you go after your dream, you can do it.
If you do it full-time, you can really make good money.
You can make a lot of money off of these.
Janet was one of hundreds of
Flint's citizens who had taken Pat's advice.
Although her husband was still working at GM... she'd seen many of her friends laid off, and didn't want to take any chances.
She'd been the founder and host of Flint's feminist radio show.
Now she was a distributor for Amway.
Color is my main love.
I got color-analyzed myself a couple of years prior to learning color consulting.
As soon as I found out what season I was... it changed my outlook. I went around draping everyone with my eyes.
I really wanted to get into this business.
It was exciting to me.
About 80 percent of the world's population is winter or summer.
Blacks, Jews, ltalians most often are winters.
I start with the orange and pink drape.
The reason is because I want to put you into a family: the warm family or the cool family.
People who are warm have a yellow undertone to their skin.
The orange drape brings the yellow undertone out... and makes them look really good.
If you put orange on someone who has a blue undertone... which would be the pink, or cool, family... then their face will get real pale... or they'll look real tired... or they'll get a lot of ruddiness come out on their face.
So I like to put what I think is the wrong color on you first... then I can compare it to the right color.
That way it will really improve how you look.
What usually happens is what I'm seeing happen to her.
She gets jaundice when you put orange on her.
She turns yellow, looks a little bit sickly.
You might not even see it that much now, but let's compare it to the pink.
I get a small commission on every account.
Join up and find out. It's good!
Three months after we attended
Janet's Amway meeting... she phoned in a panic and asked that we come back... as she'd made a terrible mistake.
I've very recently learned that I am not an autumn.
I was color-analyzed by someone in the lMS line... who are the people who taught me to do colors.
I've discovered that I am another season.
It's a warm season, like autumn, but it's spring instead.
The colors that I wear are basically the same color family... but they're lighter and brighter.
It's really a shock to me, because I am out there... color-analyzing women all the time.
Little did I know... that I was not the season that I was telling people I was.
I felt sorry for Janet.
So, to cheer her up, I let her do my colors.
As it turned out, we were the same season.
There were other ways to survive in Flint.
Taco Bell was one.
The local Taco Bell was retraining laid-off auto workers... to assemble tacos and chicken fajitas.
The local paper said this would be their dream job.
When I stopped by to see how they were doing... the manager told me why all the ex-GM workers had been fired.
Many of them say this is a lot of hard work... because assembly work is easy.
It depends on what you make it.
At Taco Bell, every day's a new day.
Every time you turn around, it's a different challenge.
-Taco Light.
-One Taco Light.
-Would you like Cinnamon Crispas?
-Yeah, you make it sound so good.
Dining here today?
Fast food is one of the most stressful environments... because of the demands on you.
Fast food demands a fast pace... because we want to present a food item... within so many seconds, if we can do it.
The transaction from assembly work and the fast pace at Taco Bell....
Some of them just couldn't develop that speed.
There's a number of small manufacturing companies that have done very well.
One I like to look at is Helmac Co.
Are you familiar with them?
They invented a lint roller.
Now they ship lint rollers all over the world... and have a very profitable, nice business operating.
Maybe there's a....
-There's all kinds of opportunities--
-Tom, wait a minute.
Lint rollers?
That's the solution to an auto industry--
That's an example.
A giant auto industry that had its birthplace here in Flint?
Lint rollers will pull us out of this depression?
There's as much opportunity here... as when Billy Durant started the motor company on Water Street.
Maybe more opportunities.
-You believe that?
-Yes, I do. Absolutely.
I saw the sign down on the street... that said you're selling rabbits and bunnies here?
-For sale?
-You want pets or meat?
Pets or meat?
Meaning I can buy the bunnies to have as a pet... or I can buy them for....
Meat. They're already dressed and cleaned.
I butcher the babies when they are four or five months old.
That's good.
If you butcher the older ones, like these guys... then they're stewers. They're not fryers.
A lot of people like fryers better than they do the stewers.
-That makes sense.
-So I keep my personal stock.
When my babies get four or five months old, and I have 15 to 20 babies... you've got to get rid of them some way.
If they don't sell as pets, you got to get rid of them as meat.
Them guys are all meat.
-See, they start doing this to each other.
-What's that?
Peeing on each other and stuff like that, when they get older.
If you don't have separate cages for them, then they start fighting.
Then the males castrate the other males.
They do. They chew their balls right off.
Then you have a bloody mess.
That's why you got to butcher them when they're a certain age... or you have a heck of a mess.
I'm on social security.
The only other income I have is my rabbits... for groceries, bills, and my dogs.
I also raise Doberman pinschers.
Because sometimes
I only make $10 to $15 a week... but that's better than nothing. At least
I can buy $10 to $15 worth of groceries.
'Cause you only get paid once a month from social security... and that's not very much.
It's really popular.
A lot of people come down here.
Usually some people come down.
They're only open on Mondays, Tuesdays,
Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays.
Saturday and Sunday, they're closed.
On the holidays, they get...
Iike, $1 to $2 bonus here and there.
If you're doing this every day, isn't your arm filled with needle marks?
They only keep it in one certain spot.
You keep it right there. Doesn't look bad.
I take some rubbing alcohol to get the scar tissue to heal up.
Can we see it?
I only do it in my right arm.
It's not so bad.
They only do it in a certain place, in a certain spot.
It's right here.
They don't track it up.
They only do it in two places.
No! My baby!
Oh, God!
Flint is best known for its principal industry.
But it's quickly gaining notoriety as a major crime center.
It's a record year for homicides in the Vehicle City.
According to the FBI, Flint now has the highest violent crime rate in America.
...crime rate is one of the highest on the continent.
A big part of the problem is there aren't enough jail cells... for all the criminals.
-I got it.
-I don't think that target would have lived.
I got two out of the ring there.
-You got three out the ring, son.
-Yes, sir.
Where is my third one?
Here's two here.
Where's the third one out of the ring?
Okay, that one's out of the ring.
Your biggest problem is your barrel length.
We usually tell them that probably their best protection for home... is the short-barreled shotgun.
-Why is that?
-It's easy to handle... and if you do have to shoot, you're not liable to miss.
And when they hear that pump gun... when you rack that, there's no other sound like it.
Usually you don't have to fire it.
They get moving pretty fast.
They'll move away.
They don't like the sound.
They know exactly what you have.
You don't have to say,
"l have a gun in my hand."
They know it'll really tear them up.
With higher unemployment creating more crime in Flint...
General Motors and the United Auto
Workers' union came up with a novel idea.
Train the ex-auto workers to be prison guards and give them jobs in the jails... now filling up with their former line mates.
It's kind of sad in a way to see somebody that you know... or had done something with on the outside being in jail... or sentenced to prison or something like that.
But I guess it's, you know....
The theory goes, you play, you pay.
And you get over it.
I'd have a possibility to move on.
That's what this 160-hour program was all about.
I have a certificate now, stating that
I can apply anywhere in the United States.
The money's not an object right now.
If I can improve myself, morally, the money will come later.
It's almost half of what I was making at General Motors...
-but I like the work a lot better.
-You'll do what?
It's not as hot.
You don't scare me by saying that.
I'll screw your fucking ass!
I don't care what you think! I'll screw you!
You'll cope with me in a few days,
I'm telling you that now!
You don't scare me! I know my rights!
-I went to school, okay?
-What's going on?
Someone in a heated discussion down there, I guess.
I'm going to jump you! I'll get you, man!
...a staff member is a violation of that rule.
I don't respect you!
When you give me respect, I'll respect you.
-Take it easy.
-I know my rights!
I really don't know the answer.
I feel sorry for people... but you can't help them. I mean, you have such a good welfare program.
So, they just don't want to work.
I don't think so. I really don't know.
-Good shot.
-That's nice.
All four of us have always lived in Flint and gone to school here.
We just love it so.
-What do you love about it?
-I personally love our friends, you know.
And we like our club, and we like... all the stores and... you know, what's left of them.
I think everybody should... try to find another job, or do something else in training, or something.
You think a lot of people are being lazy?
I think some of them.
I think a lot of them take the easy way out.
Judge issued the order to vacate the house.
-Right now?
-Yes, ma'am.
Okay, that's the least he can do.
I'll go get a truck.
-Today?
-Right now.
Can't you wait till we get a truck?
You can get the truck, but they got a crew on the way here.
They stopped at the store to get a pop.
I'd get dressed if I was you.
We got to vacate the house.
We're doing more evictions, more repossessions, and everything... way behind, trying to catch up.
A lot of these people bought school clothes and didn't pay the rent.
The system 's got to change... because if they didn't have enough money to pay rent and buy clothes... they're in trouble, anyway.
I've put out some of my best friends, but it's nothing personal, you know.
They know me, they know what I do, so....
If they're lucky enough to draw me... at least they got somebody to talk to.
What?
These people couldn't find a truck.
They called two or three different places.
They called U-Haul... and they said all their trucks were out for today.
They called Ryder Truck, and they said all of theirs were out for today.
A gentleman came by, we hauled him down, and he didn't want to get involved.
So now I assume they're on the phone, trying to get a trailer... from Mark's Trailer Rental up on Carpenter Road.
Why are all the trucks being rented here?
People are probably moving.
With GM closing, there are so many people leaving town.
We've handled over 82,000 address changes.
We're having a lot of people just abandon their house sometimes.
Thank God we're getting new equipment here.
We're getting new higher-tech computers that will be able to process more mail.
I don't foresee this job evaporating.
I feel we're secure in forwarding mail.
Usually we see somebody every day that we know... that's moved on, left town.
A lot of people are looking for work elsewhere.
My husband's currently laid off, and we're giving some thought to it ourselves.
The GM layoff.
We have been having so many trucks... go one-way to places like Florida... and places south of here.
We have a very hard time keeping trucks in the Flint area.
It's expected we'll get some of our fleet back towards midsummer... but with the layoffs coming heavier... it's going to be very hard to keep a truck around here.
I continued to dog Roger all over the country.
From Detroit to Chicago... to Washington, D.C., to New York City.
I followed a trail of three-martini lunches in pursuit of the chairman.
I finally found Roger at the
Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York City... where he was getting an award for the car of the year.
We weren't in the hotel five minutes... when GM security recognized one of our crew members... as a relative of their arch nemesis,
Ralph Nader.
They called the New York City police and carried him out... chair and all, down to precinct headquarters.
As soon as I could,
I headed to Detroit to Roger's office... where I was determined this time to get on to the 14th floor.
Excuse me.
-Where are you guys going?
-We're going up to the 14th floor.
-Do you have an appointment?
-We're going to see Roger Smith.
No, you're not. You're not getting on one of those elevators.
-Why's that?
-You're not going without an appointment.
Can we go up and try making an appointment?
Why?
I need Tony or Denise.
-The reason to talk to Roger Smith?
-Michael Moore.
No, what's your reason for seeing Roger Smith?
-Excuse me. I need to see you.
-We're making a film....
I quickly sized up the situation: three guards in the booth, plus the one with the corsage... a dozen security cameras... and four new cars with inflated sticker prices parked in the lobby.
If I made a run for it to Roger's office, what's the worst that could happen?
Before I could fully explore the consequences of such an action... my escorts to the 14th floor finally arrived.
Mr. Smith is not in at the present time.
We'd be happy to take your request under advisement, as with all appointments.
I've been told that before. I've called, written, and I've been here before.
-Have you written?
-Yes, I've written.
-To whom?
-To Roger Smith...
General Motors building,
Grand Avenue, Detroit, Michigan.
John, how about we have a letter sent to your office?
Why don't you send a letter to us... and we will be happy to, as I say, take it under advisement... just as we do all requests to see the chairman.
It's just that I've been waiting for a year to get this.
It's been under advisement for a long time.
What I'd like to do is just go up to the 14th floor... and set up an appointment with his secretary.
That would be impossible.
Obviously, I was getting the big blowoff once again.
Meanwhile, things weren't getting better back in Flint.
More jobs had been eliminated.
The city had become the unemployment capital of the country.
The visits from the stars and the creation of new jobs... had failed to pull Flint out of its depression.
Just when it appeared that all hope was lost... the city fathers came up with one last great idea.
You don't usually think of tourist attraction when you think of Flint... but people here in Flint would like to change that.
And they're willing to go to some pretty extreme lengths.
Flint officials would like to see the local tourist economy explode.
Flint's Convention and Tourism
Bureau president... says visitors should take advantage of Flint's convenient location.
Millions of travelers pass by our doorstep.
Now, with this active and aggressive promotion... we'll be able to draw them into our city and experience what we have to offer.
As part of the plan to attract tourism and conventions... the city spent $13 million in tax funds to build a Hyatt Regency Hotel.
Although most people in Flint were now too poor to afford a room at the Hyatt... the hotel allowed the public on opening day... to come and ride the city's only escalator.
We put a luxury hotel in the heart of our city... just like other cities with their luxury hotels... with everything from the fountains and high ceilings... the atrium lobby, to the large windows, the large plants.
The quality is there... what you would find in Chicago, or Atlanta, or San Francisco.
We've got some great facilities, as far as places to stay... interesting places to see, museums....
And it's a nice community to visit.
Meet Mr. and Mrs. Roberts.
They're two of the thousands of people... who decide to spend some time at Genesee County each year.
There's the sign. We're almost there.
I can hardly wait to see some of the places in the brochures.
Let's pull off and fill up first.
-You from out of town?
-Yeah, we're on vacation.
Welcome to Flint. You staying here?
Yeah, we are. Lots to do?
Sure, there's lots of attractions here.
Have you seen Crossroads Village?
See how a little hospitality, right from the start, really makes a difference?
Suggesting things to see and do builds our own image... and it creates positive word-of-mouth endorsements... the most inexpensive, yet most valuable type of advertising there is.
Once again, you see our slogan:
"Flint: our new spark will surprise you."
Capturing a lot of enthusiasm.
Letting people know there are some new and surprising things in the Flint area.
This is our visitors' log book.
I see West Germany here, Australia.
Jackie, what are some of the things that visitors ask us?
First off, "Where is the bathroom?"
That's the question I get asked most.
Then, "What is there to do in Flint?"
The city had a hard time attracting major conventions to the Hyatt.
It settled for groups like the Michigan
Ready Mix Concrete Association... and the statewide organization of Scrabble players.
On this last game,
I made a seven-letter word, "partier."
P-A-R-T-l-E-R.
So we looked in the Scrabble bible, which is this dictionary... and it isn't allowed there.
They allow "partied," P-A-R-T-l-E-D... and "parties," P-A-R-T-l-E-S... but no "partier."
So don't claim you are one ever.
Flint's leaders needed more tourists.
They hired the company that built
New York's South Street Seaport... to come to Flint and create Water Street Pavilion.
We took a four-square-block area, tore it down... and built this new facility... which is a lot of glass and steel, as well as plants... and different colors to make it festive, fun and exciting.
Also, a major parking ramp... and some other facilities connected with the building.
It's more than just another building in downtown Flint.
I like the color and the excitement of it.
It's very good for tourism in our area.
A major stop for the bus tours that come to our area.
They pull up, park the bus, and unload 40 senior citizens or so.
Water Street brings a fun atmosphere that comes with a festival marketplace... much like other festival marketplaces around the country.
But the crowning jewel in Flint's plan to attract tourists was AutoWorld... hailed by city officials as the world's largest indoor theme park.
Today is the first day... of the rebirth... of the great city of Flint.
The governor had reason to be excited.
Donny and Marie had come to celebrate the opening of AutoWorld... constructed at a cost of over $100 million... and dedicated to the belief that the automobile made America great.
I paid my $8.95 and saw something
I hadn't seen in a long time... downtown Flint, rebuilt exactly to scale... under the glass-enclosed dome of AutoWorld... to look like it used to before the factory closings.
They predicted a million tourists would come... to ride the world's only indoor Ferris wheel... to gaze at the world's largest car engine... and to meet the official sponsors of the American dream.
My favorite was the exhibit sponsored by General Motors.
A puppet auto worker... singing a love song to the robot replacing him on the assembly line.
The song was called Me and My Buddy.
AutoWorld will make a major contribution... to our important tourism and travel industry.
It's not only a contribution to that, but as the mayor said:
"To jobs for our people, our children, our neighbors."
The million tourists never came to Flint.
The Hyatt went bankrupt and was put up for sale.
Water Street Pavilion saw most of its stores go out of business.
And, only six months after opening...
AutoWorld closed due to a lack of visitors.
I guess it was like expecting a million people a year... to go to New Jersey to ChemicalWorld, or to Valdez, Alaska, to ExxonWorld.
Some people just don't like to celebrate human tragedy while on vacation.
It started to get looking like Toronto... upper middle-class black and white people... and everybody was dressed nice.
We thought it would be the entertainment center of the county... in all truth.
That may be naive, but that was my goal.
Let's make it the entertainment center... so that everybody wants to be in downtown Flint.
We're going to have entertainment and art.
It's going to be very cultural, it going to be very upbeat.
Somebody said something to me, and maybe it's true.
They said, "Look, Maxine...
"you can't make Palm Beach out of the Bowery.
"You want to make Palm Beach, you got to go there."
Half of Flint was now receiving some form of government welfare.
Meanwhile, Roger Smith gave himself a $2,000,000 raise.
GM lobbyist Tom Kay tried to explain.
I don't understand your connection, that by saying... because General Motors was born here, it owes more to this community.
-I don't agree with that.
-Why not?
Because I just don't agree with it.
I believe it's a corporation.
It's in business to make a profit.
It does what it has to do to make a profit.
That's the nature of corporations or companies.
It's why people take their own money and invest it in a business... so they can make money.
It isn't to honor their hometown.
What's going on here?
They're evicting somebody from his home.
I was just wondering.
It turned out that the guy Deputy Fred was evicting had gone to my high school.
His name was James Bond.
As if that hadn't caused him enough grief... he was now being thrown out of his home.
Where can I go to stay?
We had five kids at the place where I was this morning.
And you went over there and evicted them?
-Set them out on the ground.
-Why is that?
Because they didn't pay the rent.
You think I like this?
I got other things to do.
-You've been doing it a long time.
-It's a job.
-What can I say? It's a job.
-It's a job.
Somebody's got to do it.
I feel sorry for the people that have kids.
What will they grow up to?
What do they look forward to?
-lf I was a young man, I'd keep working.
-Look out there. It's nothing.
-They got a bleak future.
-I know. I worked over there for 17 years.
-I quit. I worked there.
-Why did you quit?
Got tired of the system.
It was like a prison to me, so I quit.
It was like a prison?
That factory played tricks on your mind.
-Where are you going to stay?
-I'll probably stay at my brother's tonight.
The thing is,
I don't want to stay with somebody.
I want a chance to have something of my own... which doesn't look like it's going to happen, ever.
Not in this town.
These are rough times.
Really rough times.
I got thrown out of my house once.
The health inspector came out... and told me that I was dressing my rabbits in a unsanitary condition.
So now I have to build me a building... where there's washable walls, washable floors... and an unbreakable light.
I have to have a scale that weighs properly... and I have to have three sinks where I dress the rabbits.
-What's going to happen to him?
-He's going to be eaten.
He's going to be our supper on the supper table.
What's the matter?
What are you guys crying about?
How do you slaughter them?
Hung them upside-down and stripped their fur off... and gutted them.
Quit biting.
And chop their heads off.
Quit it.
What happened to your brother who worked at the factory?
He got laid off.
Now you know what I'm talking about.
He's dripping.
My girlfriend out in Fenton, we tan them... and we try to make coats, gloves and animals out of the furs.
-What kind of coat does rabbit fur make?
-A rabbit coat.
-What else do you think it makes?
-ls it a nice coat? Warm?
I don't know. We ain't made one yet.
We got to get enough furs.
-How many do you need?
-A lot.
You need lots and lots of furs.
Right now, we've only got 135 furs... with all the rabbits I've done so far... before I got in trouble.
That's why I'm not actually supposed to be doing this.
I was brought up to learn to survive.
If you were out in the wilderness....
I'm getting ready to gut him.
You think it's hard to survive in Flint these days?
Why?
The shops are all going down, and people just ain't... got the money like they used to anymore... and you can't be buying things.
That's why I said my rabbit meat usually went....
The people of Flint had been through the wringer.
Then came the lowest blow.
Money magazine declared Flint the worst place to live in all the country.
The chamber of commerce and local beer distributors decided to take a stand.
They would burn Money magazine.
I came to burn Money magazine, because Flint's my adopted city.
I've lived in plenty of cities, and this is one of the best.
There's plenty of things to do.
The economy isn't that bad off.
We're all hard workers and survivors, and I support Flint.
This is to tell people that Flint is our hometown.
There's no way on God's green earth it's the worst place to live in the country.
A lot of people say there's nothing to do in Flint. "Ha! " I say.
I mean, how many cities have their own PGA Tour event?
Not that many. We have one right here.
How many cities have an air show the size we have?
How many people have parks, rivers and trees... and huge colleges like this over here?
Not that many.
We've got a lot going for us, and don't ever forget it.
One good way to start out would be with a song... about another industrial city that has seen hard times.
The Boss, Bruce Springsteen, singing a song about his hometown.
Burn, Money, burn!
That smells like Gary, Indiana.
Don't let anybody tell you you live in the country's worst place.
They're wrong!
Good evening.
I'm Ted Koppel, and this is Nightline.
Flint was now in the national spotlight.
The biggest event was to come... when Ted Koppel announced he'd interview city officials live... in front of city hall, on Nightline.
The trouble started--
Here's what we know so far.
The ABC news program Nightline was to be broadcasted live... from in front of city hall tonight.
The reason? The closing of the historic Fisher One Plant.
Apparently, moments before the broadcast... someone got in the satellite truck and drove it off, cables and all.
Nightline has had to cancel their segment from the city of Flint... and police are looking for a suspect.
Reporting live from city hall in Flint,
I'm Barb Schroeder, TV 12 News.
They caught the unemployed worker who made off with the Nightline van.
But crime in Flint continued to grow.
One guy thought he was Superman's cousin and decided to save the town.
He didn't get very far.
He just wanted us to call him Captain Dah.
He said, "You can call me Dah-Dah," whatever that meant.
The old jail couldn't hold... the increasing number of inmates the judges were locking up.
So the county built a new, state-of-the-art jail... that was five stories high and filled a city block.
The night before the jail was to open, the city threw a party... where couples paid $100 to stay overnight in jail.
When you first come in from the limo ride... from the pub-crawling before you get here, they book you... they give you a free Breathalyzer test, and a mug shot... complete with your fingerprinting.
Why do you want to spend the night in Flint jail?
-Just for the experience.
-Yes, I've never been in jail before.
Eureka!
Let's fight.
And we're having a fantastic time here.
It was time to confront Roger face to face.
Posing as a GM stockholder, I got into the annual GM shareholders' meeting.
I sat patiently as stockholders aired their grievances to the board.
Finally, it was my turn at the mike.
Microphone number 40 is somebody who hasn't had the opportunity to speak.
Mr. Chairman, I have Mr. Michael Moore... a stockholder from Flint, Michigan.
Mr. Gilbert, I wonder if you'd like to make a motion to adjourn?
I think we've answered all questions.
I think everyone has had a turn at the mike.
I have one question.
All right. Moved and adjourned.
Thank you very much.
You've been a great audience.
I thought you said Louie was here.
-He's right there.
-He was sleeping.
He got up slow, and didn't know what the hell to do.
I think he was surprised, for whatever reason.
Me, too.
I'm going to leave this stuff here, okay?
They'll pick that up and bring it?
It was two weeks before Christmas.
General Motors was closing the factory... where the great Flint Sit-down Strike had taken place.
The UAW had promised... that a massive demonstration would be held on the last day of the factory.
Only four workers showed up to protest the plant closing.
This is my second one I've closed.
It must be my destiny to close all General Motors plants.
It's never pleasant when something like this comes to an end... but life goes on.
What are you going to do?
Excuse me a minute.
Where are you guys from?
We're making a documentary about Flint, Michigan.
-From where?
-We're independent.
-We'd like you off the lot.
-Why?
Because this is private property.
We'd like you not to be here--
We thought it was a significant day here today. The factory's closing....
It is a very significant day.
It's a very sad time, a very private, personal time.
What do you think about General Motors closing up this factory?
This is a very private, emotional, family time.
-We would not let outsiders in the plant.
-We're not outsiders. We're from Flint.
You are outsiders. You don't work here.
This community depends on General Motors--
Jerry, this guy, out.
I don't understand why we can't talk to them for a couple minutes.
This is the factory's last hour.
What's the problem?
The problem is, we were told to keep you on the sidewalk.
-You're hired by GM to do that?
-That's correct. On the sidewalk, please.
Mrs. McGee. There she is. Let me ask her.
Why can't we talk to you if you're the spokesperson?
You can. I'll come outside and talk, but not inside.
I've asked you to leave.
-We'll go, if you come and talk.
-I don't think I'll talk to you.
You're the spokesperson, and you won't speak to us.
That's correct.
You don't represent anybody.
You're a private interest, and I won't speak to you.
We happen to be citizens of this community.
That's not a private interest.
We're all citizens of the community.
On the sidewalk, please.
The 1,800 hourly workers at this operation were sent home with flowers today.
Even union leaders offered them bleak advice.
One worker told me, "You know when they send you flowers? When you die. "
So, not a very merry Christmas.
In fact, as one man walked out of the plant... he told me, "l want to wish Roger Smith a merry Christmas."
It was now Christmas Eve in Flint.
After three years of trying to bring
Roger here, I was ready to give up.
Deputy Fred had three evictions scheduled for this day.
At the same time, in Detroit...
Roger Smith was beaming his Christmas message... to every GM factory throughout the world.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
I'd like to welcome you to our traditional
General Motors Christmas program.
We're trying to clear up all evictions today... so it won't get into the latter part of Christmas, which is tomorrow.
We don't want to do any tomorrow.
-Because it's Christmas?
-Right.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's my pleasure to introduce... the chairman of General Motors with his annual Christmas message...
Mr. Roger B. Smith.
You know, the thing that strikes me about Christmas... is that it's such a total experience.
For a few weeks out of our year... our whole environment is transformed.
There are the lights, of course... that lift us out of winter's cold and gloom.
This bitch got his money and sent my motherfucking shit out.
They remind us of the warmth of human companionship... and of the spring that's never far behind.
Try to lay it down.
The wind will blow it over if you don't.
We listen for jingle bells in the country.
We smell the pine needles on the trees... and the turkey on the table.
We even dream of a white Christmas... in the hope that nature will accommodate our longing for a total experience.
Where are the motherfucking keys?
-That motherfucker got his money.
-They're setting us out on the street!
I paid this man his rent. Give me my shit.
...the individual dignity and worth of each human being... the more fully human each of us will become.
He's got his money!
I showed you the paper!
All I owe that man is $150.
Now let me close with an observation... that I consider by a real leading authority on Christmas:
Charles Dickens. Here's what he said:
"l have always thought of Christmas...
"as a good time..."
Get your goddamn coats on!
"...a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time... "
Set my shit out, and I done paid the bitch!
I only owed the bitch $150, and
I was going to give it to her stinking ass.
"...the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year...
"when men and women seem by one consent...
"to open their hearts freely.
"And therefore...
"though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket...
"I believe that it has done me good...
"and will do me good.
"And I say, God bless it! "
Mr. Dickens, I couldn't agree more.
So I say, "God bless Christmas, and God bless all of you."
Thank you for coming.
Thank you, Mr. Smith.
Mr. Smith, we came from Flint... where we filmed a family being evicted from their home... the day before Christmas Eve.
A family that worked in your factory.
Would you be willing to come with us to see the situation in Flint?
I've been to Flint, and I'm sorry for them, but I don't know anything about it.
Families being evicted on Christmas Eve--
General Motors didn't evict them.
-Talk to the landlord--
-They used to work for GM.
-Now they don't work there anymore.
-I'm sorry, but....
-Could you come to Flint?
-No, I cannot. I'm sorry.
What's Christmas going to be like for you this year?
I get a couple of days off.
That's the good part.
I get a chance to rest.
But come Tuesday morning, I'll be back.
I failed to bring Roger to Flint.
As we neared the end of the 20th century... the rich were richer, the poor poorer... and people everywhere had a lot less lint... thanks to the lint rollers made in my hometown.
It was truly the dawn of a new era.
If you're espousing a philosophy, which apparently you are... that the corporation owes employees... cradle-to-the-grave security,
I don't think that can be accomplished... under a free enterprise system.
Many of us are proud to be here... and it will continue to be a good place to live and raise a family... and have a good place to work.
-Where are you going?
-I am going to Tel Aviv.
Why?
Maybe someday
I'll be the Ministress of Tourism.
I mowed the lawn with my shirt off, made my back stiff.
My wife asked me to mow the lawn with my pants off next time.
I'm planning on going back to school in January... for veterinary assistance, and also for dog grooming...
'cause there's a lot of animals that need taking care of.
It's great to have you guys here.
It's been fun having you around.
You see all the craziness that goes on.
If you decide to go for it, you'll make it.

You wanted to know the story of Fitzcarraldo.
It's a strange story- a little bit Sisyphus-like story or...
a story of, uh, challenge of the impossible.
The title itself-
I will start with that - uh, is derived from an Irish name - Fitzgerald.
The leading character's name is
Bryan Sweeney Fitzgerald.
And since nobody can pronounce his name in the Amazon here...
he calls himself Fitzcarraldo, and he also founds a town with the name Fitzcarraldo.
There was a historical figure whose name was Carlos Fermín Fitzcarrald...
a caucho baron.
I must say the story of this caucho baron did not interest me so much.
What interested me more was one single detail.
That was, uh, that he crossed an isthmus... from one river system into another... uh, with a boat.
They disassembled the boat and - and put it together again on the other river.
And, uh, that intrigued me to write a story about big opera in the jungle... and, uh, about a man who wants to bring Caruso... into Iquitos and build a huge opera house.
And he fails to - to get the money for it... and so finally he decides to make his fortune as a rubber baron.
And, uh, he buys a territory which is out of reach... because there are very, very strong rapids... and you can't move a big boat into the upper tributary.
Um, and for exploiting an area like this... you need a big boat for all the logistics and transports and so.
And what he does, actually, is that he moves in a - in a parallel tributary... because he knows there is one geographical point... where the two river systems almost join.
There's only one or two miles in between.
And with the help of, uh,
1,100 savage Indians... he moves the boat across the - this mountain ridge.
But it all fails because the Indians release the boat.
They untie it, and it floats downstream... and it crashes through the rapids and everything was in vain.
And still, with that defeat...
Fitzcarraldo is able to turn it in some kind of a victory- a very painful one, and... that's basically the story of the film.
I did not know exactly in which territory I would end up.
Basically we had to make a geographical decision...
where we had two rivers very, very near to each other...
with only a mountain in between.
Less than a mile apart.
And they had to be navigable as well.
So we had very, very few options...
and wherever we would end up...
I would try to get acquainted with the native Indians in the territory itself.
In November, 1979...
Herzog builds a camp for cast and crew...
in the dense tropical rain forest close to the Ecuadorean border.
The geography is perfect, but Herzog has walked into the middle of a tense situation.
Twenty-five miles from here, Peru and Ecuador are building up to a small border war.
Thejungle is full of soldiers, and the Aguaruna Indians...
who have lived here for hundreds of years, are touchy.
To make matters worse, the Peruvian government...
has been encouraging settlers to move into thejungle-
a process the Indians are powerless to stop without legal title to the land.
Lumber and oil interests are encroaching on this part of the forest as well.
The Amazon jungle is disappearing fast.
Every month,
8,000 square miles are cut down.
At the present rate, by the year 2010...
the entire Amazon basin will be cleared.
The ongoing invasion of thejungle has made the Aguaruna Indians...
see every stranger as a threat.
But Herzog assures them that he's not moving in permanently...
and the local Aguarunas agree to let him shoot.
Herzog needs Indians as actors and laborers...
and the Aguarunas agree to that as well.
From the start...
- they never considered that the communities here...
Had their own authorities.
They never respected the organizations that are here.
Although Herzog has reached an agreement with the local Aguarunas...
he soon finds himself tangled in a complicated power struggle.
A newly formed tribal council from downriver...
is trying to establish political leadership for all the Indian communities in the area.
The council members see Herzog's film as a perfect opportunity to cement their position.
After shooting the film, when they take it to Europe...
it could show how the Aguarunas and Huambisas were exploited and killed...
during the time of the caucho.
It could give that impression.
We don't like that.
That's why we reject it.
Not everyone supports the Aguaruna council.
Although Herzog is only paying 3.50 a day...
it's twice the going wage for Indian labor.
- Nelson is one of the Aguaruna leaders...
who think the Indians should continue working for Herzog and his producer, Walter Saxer.
The tribal council has put out a warrant for his arrest, charging him with treason.
Death threats are being made against him and the film company.
Nelson's mother is frightened.
- What's she saying?
- She says... that you who work for the company... are at fault for what has happened to Nelson... because you want to take him with you.
She doesn't want Nelson to go.
We support Nelson. It's an unjust thing... and she shouldn't worry.
We'll do all we can to clear up this situation once and for all.
Nelson can't be guilty.
It's just not his fault.
We'll continue to protect your son.
The rumors the Aguaruna spread who were against us... uh, for example, said that we would cut - we would dig a canal between the two river systems - between Rio Marañón and further up between, uh...
Rio Cenepa and leave the community of Waiwaim as an island... which would dry out.
And they spread rumors we - we would, uh... slaughter them and take the grease out of their bodies and cook the grease... and that we would rape their women and that we would, uh... do any kind of harm to them.
There were other rumors by the press that we were smuggling arms.
That we had -While we were shooting that we destroyed their fields.
But we are not shooting yet.
There were rumors that, uh, we had four-
On our demand, four Aguaruna Indians were arrested... who were in opposition against us.
Which is a blatant lie.
And it can be checked easily.
Not even the council of the Aguarunas maintains that anymore.
And then there were some, uh, agitators here -
Even from Germany two guys came here eight days ago... and they brought a lot of photos with, uh - from concentration camps with piles of bodies.
And they had other photos with them of a- of a tribe-
I don't know yet which one.
And they claimed that I had, uh-
It was my fault...
that this tribe was extinguished and wiped out.
We are necessary as an enemy that can be beaten... because they will not dare to attack, uh... the, uh - the military camps.
They will not dare to attack, uh, the petrol companies... but since we are small, we -we may be - uh, we may be the losers.
Sensing imminent danger, Herzog pulls most ofhis film crew out of thejungle.
On December 1, 1979, armed Indians surround the film camp...
and order everyone who's still there to leave.
When the camp is empty, the Aguarunas burn it to the ground.
The last members of Herzog's crew flee downriver...
flying white flags from their canoe.
It takes Herzog 13 months to find a new location for thejungle camp.
In January, 1981, filming finally begins in Iquitos...
1,500 miles north of the new camp.
Iquitos is a river port city near the headwaters of the Amazon in northern Peru...
with a jet airport and a population of 200,000.
It was originally a rubber boomtown built at the turn of the century...
when giant fortunes were being made overnight in the rubber business.
This is the historical period in which Herzog's film story is set.
The cast features
Jason Robards as Fitzcarraldo...
a poor, charming Irishman who's obsessed with grand opera.
Fitzcarraldo is determined to build a great opera house in Iquitos...
where his idol,
Enrico Caruso, can perform.
His first scheme involves trying to convince
Iquitos's high society to finance the project...
but to no avail.
Mick Jagger plays Fitzcarraldo's sidekick...
a simpleminded actor named Wilbur.
Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Ho! Ho!
- We want the opera in Iquitos!
- We want the opera in Iquitos!
We need opera here!
Don't you want...
- We need the opera in Iquitos!
- Music in your souls?
- In your ear!
- Come! Come and join us!
Jesus.
Momento. Un momento.
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover... to entertain these fair well-spoken days...
I am determined to prove a villain... and hate the idle pleasures of these days.
Wilbur, you are definitely my man.
Five weeks after filming begins, with 40% of the picture completed...
Jason Robards comes down with a bad case of amebic dysentery.
He flies home to recover, and his doctor forbids him to return to the set.
For Herzog, this is an agonizing setback.
He'll have to start all over with a new leading actor...
and his backers are pulling out.
For six weeks, Herzog puts the entire production on hold...
while he goes looking for another star.
Then Jagger drops out too.
Commitments for a new album and a concert tour...
make it impossible for him to stay the extra months needed...
to reshoot the film from scratch.
And I have decided that I would not replace his part.
You can't replace him.
So I think that's, uh, biggest loss that I have had in my career...
as someone who makes films.
When I came back to Germany, and I tried to hold all the investors together... they said to me,
"Well, how can you continue?
Can you - Uh, do you have the strength or the will or the enthusiasm or so?"
And I said,
"How can you ask this question? It is -
"If I abandon this project,
I would be a man without dreams... and I don't want to live like that. "
I - I - I live my life, or I end my life with this project.
In April, 1981...
Herzog's new leading man,
Klaus Kinski...
arrives at the Iquitos Airport.
And the filming of Fitzcarraldo starts all over again.
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.
Bananas.!
- Bananas!
- Miguel Vázquez!
Come on.!
Miguel Vázquez.! Bananas.!
Cut. Okay.
Stop.
Fitzcarraldo lives in the Belen district of Iquitos...
a collection of small houses in the shallow floodwater at the edge of the Amazon...
that's hardly changed in the last hundred years.
- I picture from this time -
- Klaus Kinski, the new Fitzcarraldo...
has appeared in more than 150 films.
Everything from Doctor Zhivago to Herzog's Nosferatu.
This will be the fourth feature he's done for Herzog.
In this scene, some of the local kids are waiting for Fitzcarraldo to wake up...
hoping they'll get to hear one ofhis precious Caruso records.
This is the Nariño... a boat that was built in 1902 in Glasgow.
And we found this boat in Colombia on one of the Amazon tributaries.
Uh, it was used for-as a steamboat up and down the Amazon...
and later on it was used in the, uh, war against Colombia.
As a matter of fact, the peace treaty was signed on that boat here.
It was very hard to move it here.
As you see, there are many leaks.
We had to fill the whole hull with empty petrol drums.
And so we kept it afloat, and we tugged it about, uh...
350 miles up the river, and we put it here.
And it should be rusty, as it is.
And it will be one of the leading characters in the picture that we are doing.
Italian film star Claudia Cardinale plays Fitzcarraldo's lover, Molly...
the madam of an elegant brothel catering to the wealthiest rubber barons in Iquitos.
She uses her contacts to help him buy a steamship he needs...
to make enough money to build the opera house.
Claudia, there is also one thing.
You could easily try to open one of those doors.
- Yes. This one?
- Yeah. No, not this one.
- This here is closed.
- This one.
This one is closed.
So you can't do - you can't do any-
- Yeah. No.
- No.
- You shouldn't open that one. Yes.
- I just try to open, but it's closed.
- That's the only one that you should not open.
- Okay.
Of course, we need another boat going on the river.
And for this reason we have bought another boat...
which has about the same size, the same shape of the hull.
The Huallaga, which was built in 1906.
And we rebuilt the whole boat, and we repaired the engine...
and we'll need a third boat- a look-alike.
No one knows how long it's going to take to pull a real steamship over a hill in thejungle...
which is why Herzog needs three ships.
While one of the ships stays in Iquitos and another goes over the hill...
Herzog can keep on shooting with the third ship...
including a crucial scene in the Pongo das Mortes...
the "Rapids of Death. "
The Huallaga may be destroyed in the Pongo.
We'll try to save it with, uh, remote control from a helicopter.
I'm not 100% sure whether it will make it.
But I hope because there's so much work and care and toil in it.
Many, many people have given their sweat and their...
blood of their heart.
And it's really beautiful.
I- I like the boats very much.
Uh, very close to my heart.
I would like to keep them all.
Did you sail the ship all the way up the river from Iquitos?
Yes. They had to come from Iquitos all the way up here... which was quite hard.
It's a very, very big distance.
Maybe 1,500 miles or 2,000 miles.
Between Rio Urubamba and Rio Camisea... we are pulling the boat now.
After shooting in Iquitos...
Herzog moves cast and crew
1,500 miles south...
to his newjungle location on the Rio Camisea.
From Iquitos, under the best of circumstances...
it takes a full day to reach the camp by air...
with the last leg in a small, single-engine plane...
and over two weeks by boat when the rivers are navigable at all.
Since Herzog admits he could shoot most of Fitzcarraldo right outside Iquitos...
some people think the remotejungle location...
is just another example ofhis insistence on making things tough.
Herzog claims that the isolated location...
will bring out special qualities in the actors and even the film crew...
that would be impossible to achieve otherwise.
The local Machiguenga Indians are cooperative...
but Herzog's problems are far from over.
The upper Amazon tributaries are too shallow for large ships to use unless they're flooded.
Originally, Herzog had planned to shoot during the rainy season...
when the rivers would have been high enough for him to move his ships.
But all the delays have thrown him badly off schedule.
By now the rainy season is over...
and the rivers are falling fast.
He has no choice.
Ifhe waits, the film will collapse.
The film camp is located in the eastern foothills of the Andes.
It's blazing hot in the sun, chilly when it clouds over.
People sleep under blankets at night.
Heavy thunderstorms can strike at any hour of the day or night...
and clothing never quite dries out.
Herzog provides flush toilets, cold-water showers...
and a noisy electric generator to power the lights...
keep the beer cold and maintain a radio link with the outside world.
The only sour note comes from the radio:
A loud, yammering squawk that never ceases.
Pucallpa, Camisea.
If you look that way- this is east - you would, uh, have to walk
2,500 miles until the jungle ends.
That way you would have to walk, let's say, 2,000 miles.
This way you have to walk, let's say, 1,500 miles.
And this way you walk maybe 500 miles until the jungle ends.
Fitzcarraldo plans to finance his opera house with profits from the rubber boom.
So he befriends Don Aquilino...
an eccentric caucho baron who's already made millions exploiting rubber trees and native labor.
Aquilino is played byJosé Lewgoy...
a leading actor in many
Brazilian TV soap operas.
Is this a rubber tree?
Right.
Cut.
Look how elastic it is.
Yeah.
What do you think is wrong with the rubber?
It either looks like bread or like shit.
I can't help it.
I can't help it.
Over there. I presume you're - you're familiar with the market price.
- It's one of my- Here?
- Yeah.
Yeah. Maybe you take that hat -
I - I would suggest that you leave the hat here when you walk over.
- Okay.
- Leave that hat over here. Yeah.
- Or you can leave it -Yes, yes.
- Oh!
- Because the - the smoke disturbs you. Yes.
- Yeah. The smoke.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
How much do you think this stinking stuff weighs?
Sixty kilos. And I presume you're familiar with the market price.
How long does it take to make one of these?
Three men, one week.
Presently I have a staff of 8,500.
I'm thinking of increasing it to 10.
You know, you're a strange bird...
but I must say I like you.
This is just impossible.
This is impossible.
It's enough to put you to sleep.
Could you look over there?
- Yeah. With the eyes.
- I look there. Yes.
- Yeah. Yeah. This kind of-
- Okay.
- This kind of raving -Yeah.
- Okay.
Let's have a -
Let's have a very wild one.
- Yeah.
- Like this here. Can you find a position? Yes.
- There. Yeah.
- That is a position for the 10,000.
- Okay. Okay.
- The dream is right up at that-at that branch.
- All right.
- Okay?
But I'm thinking of increasing it to 10.
To act in front of a camera gives me physical pleasure.
That's when I get myself realized.
Otherwise I would be a bank manager.
If- If you remove that pleasure-
If you take this pleasure-
then the- what- what have you left?
The hardship of doing this film, which is a very difficult and very hard-
physically hard film to do.
Basically, all our equipment and all our resources...
would come all the way from Iquitos.
The next town that you can call a town would be Pucallpa.
It's half the distance between Iquitos and Camisea.
And that, of course, is a-
is an enormous trouble to get even a nail into the camp...
or anything that you need.
The chicken is dead.
- It's dead?
- Yeah.
With the river this low, the slightest error in navigation...
can run a ship aground.
But when a sudden rainstorm raises the water level for a few short hours...
Herzog tries a desperate gamble and takes the ship out onto the river to shoot an important scene.
- We are in trouble.
- What's wrong?
I don't know exactly. The -
The engine is not strong enough.
And we are going backwards, and we've run on ground.
Here on these rocks.
And the water is sinking.
But if we-if we go into this...
we might lose this boat.
If that gets stuck... then we can forget about shooting... for the next maybe half year.
There's nothing wrong with the engine.
There's just not enough ballast in.
See, they took all the stones, all the - the diesel fuel out to get it over the mountain.
So now it's too light, and the propeller comes out of the water... and just, uh -just turns around.
It's -There's no force enough to push it, you know.
With the ship run aground in the shallows...
Herzog builds a mock-up with identical rigging...
in order to continue shooting.
Through a camera lens on the top deck, it will look just like the real thing.
Are there more people?
Divide everyone up among the empty canoes.
Check again to see if there are any more brave men who know how to swim and row.
Fitzcarraldo has discovered a way to reach unexploited rubber trees.
His plan is to pull the ship over a hill...
at a point in thejungle where two parallel rivers come within a mile of each other.
He steams upriver in search of the overland passage, but it's a terriblejourney...
and finally he decides to turn back.
Then he sees that Indians have cut offhis retreat.
Everyone this way!
Slowly!
Be serious.!
Careful! Quickly!
Slowly!
Señora, get inside.!
Sit down, you in yellow.!
Señora, get inside.!
You, señora.! You.!
Everyone look this way.
Señora in the yellow, get a little more in place.
- Should they go back again?
- Don't laugh.
Everyone, all the canoes have to go back!
Go back!
Go back, and then come forward again.
Everyone back!
Well, some of them come from the area where we are actually shooting.
Machiguengas from this territory.
But there are also Campas around.
But, um, the... big amount of Campas came from a place - Oventeni.
Rio Tambo, Rio Ene.
From this area. Some of them were flown here to the river...
and came all the way up on the river in boats.
Some of them were flown in directly...
and some of them- the people from Oventeni-
whom I like best,
I must say-
they came on foot four days over the mountains, to the river...
and then they were picked up and driven to the camp.
- There's no action. No action.
- Well, we're gonna have an interview with you.
I am sitting here.
I am sitting here... very satisfied.
We are waiting at the moment- waiting for some Indians more...
and waiting for some canoes more...
and when we have some canoes more, we are waiting for some Indians more more.
That's our problem in the moment.
And in one hour it's too late.
In one hour, it's absolutely too late.
It takes several days to film the scene...
especially since Herzog insists on shooting during what's known as the "magic hour"...
at the end of the day as the sun sets and the light turns warm and golden.
Timing is crucial, and Herzog spends most of the two days waiting for the light.
Twenty arrows against a zoom, huh?
I'm afraid they'll get more and more bored and suddenly shoot.
"Look at that big guy there with the weird lens.
Think you can get him?"
"I'll get him.!"
"No, you won't get him.
You're shaking too much. "
"But I'll get him. "
Get the camera and film that.
- No, it's too dark now.
Come on. It'll still work.
It'll still work.
"It'll still work. "
You can't see anything at all!
David, the canoes should stay here.
On the riverbank.
In this case, we will probably have one of the last feature films...
with authentic natives in it.
They are fading away very quickly.
And it's a-a catastrophe and a tragedy that's going on.
And we are losing riches and riches and riches...
and we lose, uh, cultures and individualities...
and languages and mythologies, and we'll be stark naked at the end.
We'll end up like all the cities in the world now...
with, uh, skyscrapers and-
and a universal kind of culture like-like the American culture.
I don't feel like doing a documentary on- on the Campas...
and it, uh-it should not end up as a ethnographic film.
I also stylize them, and I have them in the film... as they probably are not precisely in their- in their normal life.
They do things that they normally would not do.
They act in that film... and that interests me even more.
Yet they have an authenticity of their culture...
and their behavior, their movements...
their language in it that, uh...
will just, uh, disappear from the face of this earth.
I don't want to live in a-in a world where there are no lions anymore.
Or where the are no people like lions - and they are lions.
Well, these people are, uh, watchmen for the night...
because we have, uh, had an incident with a man who was... attacked by arrows.
That means there were three people.
His wife, the man and another young man.
And further up that river you can see here... and only two hours by speedboat from here...
this attack occurred, and the man was hit with an arrow through the throat.
And on the leg.
And his wife was- was hit three times.
I have not seen her yet.
But apparently here in the hip...
and a little higher.
And that was in complete darkness.
And they were lucky that they had a- a doctor here and a very good paramedic...
who, uh, operated them immediately.
They will do a raid upstream now, and...
I hope they don't make any contact.
Because if they make contact... and if something is going on there... we will probably have a raid of the Amahuacas down here.
And it's all because the river is so unusually low.
You can see all these riverbanks. Sometimes the water went all the way up to that camp...
about six, seven yards higher- about 20 feet higher or so.
And now, uh, turtles come to the sandbanks and lay their eggs.
Uh, and the Amahuacas come very, very far down to dig for turtle eggs.
And that's why this clash came.
But I have also asked for the assistance of some of the Campas...
which is very unusual because, uh...
Machiguengas here in this area were afraid of the Campas.
There's always... a feeling of terror when you speak about the Campas of Gran Pajonal.
I can't stop them here.
It would be impossible.
I would interfere in their-
How do I say?
In their habits, or in their space of living... if I kept them back.
And if I let them go - as it has happened
I couldn't stop them anyway- there might be a - a more serious incident, and... it will be all on my shoulders.
I can foresee-
I can foresee a lot of trouble.
And we've had enough-
We've had enough trouble.
I'm - I'm run -
I'm running out of fantasy.
I don't know what else can happen now.
While the raiding party is away...
Herzog films the traditional game of arrow catching.
But he fails to get what he wants...
because the best arrow catchers are upriver with the raiding party.
Aim directly at the head.
Use more force.
Those are the arrows the doctor gave me.
Uh, this one struck the woman here.
It's more or less intact.
She, uh -They are very heavy.
And this point here is damaged because it hit her here in the hip.
And the arrowhead broke... and here it cracked open a little bit on impact.
And that's the arrow -
This is the arrow that hit the man through the throat.
Here. That came loose.
It's very big feathers.
I think it's, uh, vulture feathers.
And, uh, the arrowhead -
It is very sharp and very, very-well-pointed.
And there's still some blood on it.
So. They are -They are some gruesome weapons.
Are you gonna keep the arrows?
Well, yeah. Maybe for my little son.
He will be excited to know that this went through a man.
But I don't know.
A week later the raiding party returns.
They have made a successful show of strength without bloodshed.
Life in the camp returns to normal.
Were you afraid of the gringos when you came here?
No, I wasn't afraid... because I understood what they were doing.
My friend Walter told me it was all lies.
What did they tell you?
That the gringos would take off your face?
Yes, they'll take off your face... and use your fat for airplanes.
We're not like theJivaros who shrink heads this small.
I told him...
I'd rather get out ofhere...
before they do that to me.
When my friends arrived and saw the camps... they were really afraid.
I told them,
"Don't be afraid. "
They said,
"They're all just waiting to kill us. "
"No, they've been waiting for you. "
Atalaina told them...
"The doctor will give you an injection and take your blood...
"and put poison in your veins.
You'll die by the time you get back to your village. "
They were so afraid.
That's not true.
And, " Don't eat too much of what they offer.
"They give you this much.
Don't eat it all... because they'll fatten you up to kill you. "
Eating pork fattens you up.
Not at all.
This scene is the first real contact between Fitzcarraldo and the natives.
Afterwards, the Indians agree to pull
Fitzcarraldo's ship over the hill.
In Herzog's screenplay, they think he's some kind of white god...
a kindred spirit who believes, as Herzog puts it...
that everyday life is only an illusion...
behind which lies the reality of dreams.
Okay.
Everyone can cough now.
Oh.
They're hanging around like a bunch of chickens... but they're trying to do a good job.
Very good.
Why did you decide to have two, you know, clearly marked off separate camps...
between the cast and the Indians?
Yeah, there was, um-
There was long discussion about that- how we should handle it.
And my feeling was that we should not involve them... in the kind of problems that we had here.
In our kind of organization, our technical things.
Um, besides,
I did not want to have them... too much contaminated in, uh -
- How do you say? In parentheses.
- Quotes.
Yeah. Yeah. In quotes.
Uh, by Western culture.
They should be among themselves, and they-
They, for example, wouldn't like our food...
and it would have caused problems.
And we didn't probably expect to eat their kind of food.
So, um...
these two camps mark a very clear distinction...
that I never tried to conceal-
that there is a highly technical group of people here...
from a different continent...
with a different history behind them...
and another group of native Indians...
who basically is living here in this environment...
has its own way oflife, its culture.
The women were getting madder and madder
As the men got drunk on masato
The men said
"Why don't you drink with us?"
So the women drank some too
They felt so good they wanted some loving
But the men were so drunk they couldn't
All through the upper Amazon,
Indians drink masato...
an alcoholic beverage made from a vegetable called yuca.
It's an important food source, making up a large part of the Indians'diet.
It's also an essential part of almost every activity, from morning till night.
In order to chew it... you first have to peel the yuca.
Then you boil it.
After boiling it...
you put it in the cusho.
This is the cusho?
- Yes, it is.
Then you pound it until it's soft.
After that, you chew it.
- What's chancar?
- What we're doing here.
After pounding it, you chew it.
When it's soft like this...
you add water.
By the next day...
it's fermented.
You strain it with a sieve and drink it.
So you spit here.
Quiet, please.
- Silencio.
- ¡Silencio.!
Yeah. Yeah.
- Sound.
- Right.
Work.!
Masato is also a ceremonial liquor that seals every important agreement.
Fitzcarraldo has been invited tojoin his new comrades in a ritual toast...
but Kinski is terrified of infection.
The thought of drinking something that someone spit into is unbearable.
After scrubbing out the bowl with bottled water...
he pours in canned milk to substitute for the dreaded masato.
He wants you to drink it.
It's yuca fermented with saliva. Drink.
My God. Time flies, and we're getting nowhere.
- Oh!
- It doesn't matter. They'll make another one.
No good. It's no good.
Look here, kid.
This is no good.
The Indians agree to make a few bows and arrows for Kinski.
They accept his payment of $3.50 an arrow...
the equivalent of a full day's wage.
To the Indians, who can make
20 arrows in a day...
this probably seems like an extreme overpayment...
until they have to pay the same 3.50 for a single Polaroid photo...
taken by one of the Peruvian workers.
They earn about twice as much here...
as they would earn when they work in the field somewhere.
In- On Rio Tambo or somewhere else.
The tractor driver earns, uh...
a good average wage for a tractor driver here.
But it is no comparison between, uh...
the level of salaries that we have to pay...
to actors and technicians here from Europe or United States...
and those people here.
And I think many- many, many of the things... should not be counted and calculated in - in terms of money.
What is much more important for the natives here... is that this land here which has no land title yet... will belong to them after we have finished that film.
And, um, to struggle for them, uh... for the land title for- for this whole territory- that no settlers or no oil companies or no lumber people... can exploit it and take it away from them... that - that is something decisive.
Because Herzog wants to avoid repeating the situation with the Aguarunas...
he's made a different deal this time.
He's promised the Machiguenga Indians, on whose territory he's shooting...
to help them get legal title to their land.
Ready.!
It's much steeper than we thought.
We have to level the ground.
Build a ramp.
And up here...
we have to make a cut through to the top.
That'll take months.
Dynamite.
I hope we have enough dynamite.
Stop, stop.!
- Señores- - Apath is being cut through thejungle for the ship...
up a steep hill from the Camisea...
across a mile of dense muddy forest...
and down the other side to the Urubamba.
You have to take the branches... and throw them aside...
cutting with a lot of-
Can you explain it to them?
Don't rush, but work hard.
I want these thrown to the side.
Work.!
We must level the ground.
Build a ramp.
And up there...
we have to make a cut through to the top.
They were furious and declared war.
- Cut.
The bare-asses believe the earth is a living being.
Okay.
Did the territory hold any surprises for you...
that you didn't know about from your preplanning?
Yes, of course.
Bad surprises.
For example, that the terrain is not firm...
where we wanted to have our path for the boat.
It's just completely muddy and wet.
So we had to cut another path...
and that brought us problems because we had to cut deep into the mountain...
and it's very- very, very tough...
and there were landslides.
Recently, since more than a quarter of a century...
there hasn't been so much rain now...
and that has brought us bad surprises.
But basically it is what I have been looking for.
Today... it went well, but -
I don't know -
I hated the day.
I don't know why.
I have no reason to hate it, but I -
I didn't like that mud up there.
Sometimes I wish to sit in an easy chair and -
With a cup of tea next to me.
The bulldozer cutting the path through thejungle uses 150 gallons of fuel a day-
fuel that has to be flown in by lightplane and ferried up the river in dug-out canoes.
The bulldozer is designed for tough work...
but Herzog bought it used, and it breaks down constantly.
Spare parts have to be flown in all the way from Miami via Iquitos...
and sometimes they're not even the right parts.
With the topsoil bulldozed away...
heavy rain turns the clay into deep, slippery muck.
Even when the bulldozer is working, it spends hours every day sliding helplessly in the mud.
Despite Herzog's high technology, thejungle is winning.
Most of the Indians signed on for three months...
but because of shooting delays, some have stayed six months.
The Indian camp wasn't designed for such long occupancy.
Sanitation, medical and food supply systems are breaking down.
Nor are the Indians used to living in large groups.
Social relations are tense.
That woman there is single. Those two are sisters.
The wife has reason to be angry because one of the sisters favors her husband.
You think it's right that she tell her husband...
"Go with her, then"?
They both want the same man?
No, one of the sisters wants to fight the wife for her husband.
So they want to fight like men with fists and all?
- Yes, they do.
- Is the sister saying she'll win because she's bigger?
That's what she says.
They call the other one an "old lady. "
Now my aunt's saying, "Go.!
Now that he's left his wife, go live with him. "
And who's that girl in the back?
My sister-in-law.
She's also on her side. She's saying...
"Now that I really don't have my husband, I don't want him.!
I'll leave him. "
Father Mariano Gagnon, a Franciscan missionary...
comes to look into the welfare of the Indians from his mission.
The Indians are bored, morale is low...
and some of the latest arrivals have had to leave their wives and families behind.
On top of everything else, the only soccer ball in camp has a hole in it.
We can't solve the problem... of their being confined to such a small area.
Secondly, we can't solve the problem...
of their wives and families not being here.
We can certainly solve the problem of the medicine, the sanitation.
As for the masato, we'll talk to the others.
- The soccer problem is very serious.
- Their not having masato is a problem.
Who's going to make it for them?
The women make masato.
If the women from their own tribes aren't here, they can't have masato.
Another woman from another group can't make masato for them.
That would compromise the tribe.
It's part of their culture, and it's just not done.
That's a problem.
There's nothing really serious.
It's just little things.
But I'm sure a lot of them could be straightened out.
The film crew is just as bored as the Indians.
A series ofbulldozer breakdowns and heavy rains have slowed filming to a crawl.
People amuse themselves as best they can...
but below the surface, anxiety and frustration are high.
If we would work from the morning to the evening...
- Yeah.
- that's fine.
That's fine.
You- You have to do something.
You have to move, you know. But now we're just sitting and sitting and sitting around. So-
You can't go anywhere.
You can't go -
You can't escape of this fucking stinking camp... because you never know when they call you.
Because you have to be here because you're paid for it.
You are under contract, so you can't just go.
It means you're completely captured here.
Completely. You go from there to there and from there to there.
That's all that you can do.
So, of course, it's -
At least you have this view.
Instead of-
Instead of something else.
And you feel you're right in thejungle... which is a good feeling, you know.
Ay, ay, ay.
- Nice?
- Really nice, isn't it?
What do they do that with?
What? The tattoo?
They do it with a needle.
- Doesn't it hurt?
- Just a little.
What do the wings mean?
- The wings and the heart.
- They stand for love.
It's not your sign, is it?
No, it's not my sign.
Do you want a tattoo?
- Yes, on my leg.
- Your leg?
Here.
I agreed to have them here...
because even the Dominican padre here...
advised me very strongly to have them here.
Because, as you know, in the neighborhood... we do have two, uh, native villages -
Machiguenga villages.
Shivancoreni and Camisea.
And if after months and months... of having these people here in the - in the camp - all the workers - mestizos and white people - uh, they might go after the women down in the - in the villages... and that would - would really cause problems.
So, even the Catholic priest has advised us to have some - some ladies here.
You have two children?
- Yes, two children.
- How old are they?
- One is eight months old. The other is three years old.
Did you get into this profession because you liked it?
No, out of necessity.
Not because I liked it.
If it was because I liked it...
I'd find a man and spend my time with him and fulfill my needs... if it was for my pleasure.
But it's not that.
I do it out of necessity.
When you would ask me, uh...
to have a prostitute in my, uh- on my shooting location in the United States or in Germany, it would be ridiculous... but here, uh... it is standard expectation and standard behavior... and somehow the -
I don't know.
The -The jungle sweats it out.
It's not even ob-obscene.
It is, uh...
probably some fertility or whatever...
that's going on here in thejungle.
Estebán.
Be careful when we hit so you don't fall off.
Boom.
Well, the boat that Fitzcarraldo actually pulled across was only 30 tons.
- Yes.
- And how big is your boat?
Besides, they, uh, disassembled it in about 14 or 15 parts... and carried these parts individually across a mountain.
And, um...
I find it much better to - to leave it intact as it is.
Like this here.
And you can tell the difference - that this is not a plastic boat and that this - that this slope here is no - no joke at all.
The central metaphor of my film...
is that they haul a ship over what's essentially an impossibly steep hill.
If I lose that by using a level terrain... like the Panama Canal...
I lose the central metaphor of my film.
For this reason, we don't agree.
As I've said,
I'd like to take a bit greater risk... than what you advise.
Laplace Martins, a Brazilian engineer...
has worked out a complicated system to pull Herzog's ship over the hill...
with cables, pulleys and the bulldozer.
But the system is designed for a 20-degree slope.
Herzog insists on 40 degrees.
The system has already failed once.
Martins is afraid people will die if it tears apart again.
About 60 men will work on this big capstan.
This is one of the places of greatest potential danger.
If the tractor pulls loose from the pulley system... one of the cables could break... and the pulley could wind up here.
And if the ship begins to slide backwards... it will drag all this with it.
And if there are people here... and if for some unfortunate reason they can't jump clear... or jump from here to there, which is lower ground... they'll run the risk of getting hit.
This winch could hit this one... this one could hit this one, and so forth.
It would be a real catastrophe.
To be safe, let's all stay here... until the post is secure.
We need someone very responsible who will always be by the post... ready to warn us if anything goes wrong... and stop the work immediately if there are any signs...
that the post can't hold out.
Otherwise, four, five, or six people could lose their lives.
- Many more.
- More?
He says that more than five would die.
If there are 60 people, how many could die?
They could all fly offlike a rocket.
He says they would all fly offlike rockets.
Yeah, if the thing pulls out.
- Then 20 or 30 would die.
Martins quits.
Herzog decides to continue without him.
There's a 30% chance... a 30% chance they'll do it.
Does that mean a 70% chance of catastrophe?
Yes. It could be a catastrophe.
What do you think about pulling a ship over a mountain?
They won't be able to do it... because it's not small.
If it were a tiny little boat, they could do it quickly.
But since it's huge, the cables could pull out and kill us.
Besides, it's a three-story boat.
Who could push such a big ship...
when we can't even pull a canoe?
Are you afraid something will happen to you with the boat?
They're afraid of losing their lives.
If we have to push the boat...
the owner should be there behind it too.
If we die, he should die too.
Why should we die and not the owner?
Jorge, some people are missing!
Everybody out of here.
Quick! Quick!
Out of here! Get them out of here!
Quick! Come on!
Out! Out!
Give it a go!
Pull it.!
Try again!
It works.
It works!
It works!
- But it didn't work.
- Something broke.
What everyone has feared has happened.
A massive metal coupling has snapped in half...
and the ship slides back to where it started.
- It fell?
- Yes.
Right here.
Look at him.
What do I do now? Jump in the water?
Yes.
Yeah.
Then get some lunch.
Wash yourself off a little.
Herzog is stranded in thejungle with a 300-ton steamship that won't move...
and time is running out.
He needs money to move the ship, but no one will invest unless the ship moves first.
Behind his back, some of the actors are talking about getting out while the getting is good.
Only a few of the cast, crew and Indians believe in his dream anymore.
Even Herzog is beginning to wonder.
Of course, we are challenging nature itself...
and it hits back.
Itjust hits back. That's all.
And that's grandiose about it.
And we have to- to accept that it is much stronger than we are.
Kinski always says it's full of...
erotic elements.
I don't see it so much erotic.
I see it more full of obscenity.
It's just-
Nature here is vile and base.
I wouldn't see anything erotical here.
I would see fornication and asphyxiation... and choking and fighting for survival... and growing and... just rotting away.
Of course, there's a lot of misery.
But it is the same misery that is all around us.
The trees here are in misery, and the birds are in misery.
I don't think they- they sing.
They just screech in pain.
It's an unfinished country.
It's still prehistorical.
The only thing that is lacking is- is the dinosaurs here.
It's like a curse weighing on an entire landscape.
And whoever... goes too deep into this...
has his share of that curse.
So we are cursed with what we are doing here.
It's a land that God, ifhe exists...
has-has created in anger.
It's the only land where- where creation is unfinished yet.
Taking a close look at - at what's around us... there - there is some sort of a harmony.
It is the harmony of... overwhelming and collective murder.
And we in comparison to the articulate vileness... and baseness and obscenity... of all this jungle -
Uh, we in comparison to that enormous articulation - we only sound and look like... badly pronounced and half-finished sentences... out of a stupid suburban... novel - a cheap novel.
And we have to become humble...
in front of this...
overwhelming misery and...
overwhelming fornication...
overwhelming growth...
and overwhelming lack of order.
Even the- the stars up here in the-in the sky look like a mess.
There is no harmony in the universe.
We have to get acquainted to this idea that...
there is no real harmony as we have conceived it.
But when I say this, I say this all full of admiration for the jungle.
It is not that I hate it.
I love it.
I love it very much.
But I love it against my better judgment.
Once again, Herzog pushes on in the face of disaster.
Leaving a small crew to work on moving the ship up the hill...
Herzog takes the second look-alike steamship...
a full day's journey downriver to the Pongo de Manique...
the most dangerous rapids in Peru.
In the film, after the Indians pull the ship over the hill...
there's a giant drunken party...
and Fitzcarraldo passes out in his cabin.
While he sleeps, the Indians release the ship.
They have a dream of their own...
in which they sacrifice the ship to the river gods.
Fitzcarraldo stumbles on deck to find himself crashing through the rapids.
His dream is shattered.
Beautus, look here.
This is how you can stop it again.
It must play in the beginning so that the scene starts with music.
Is that a gramophone needle?
No, it's a regular old sewing needle.
What else can you see?
You can't get a sound out of it anyway, Klaus.
- Paul.
- Yeah.
- Good luck.
- You too.
If you fall, I'll catch you, Thomas.
Let's go. Let's risk it.
Everyone ready?
The engine.! Cholo.!
Klaus, come over here.! It was okay. Watch out.
It really came up fast.
The background went by incredibly fast.
- I'm afraid he ran out too soon.
No, the background went by too fast.
- Klaus, come on.
- The engine.! Cholo.! The engine.!
We have to bandage Thomas up.
Okay, we have someone here to do it.
It's not that serious.
Did you hurt yourself?
Your temple is cut open, and your hand too. Believe me.
You have my best blood.
It's too bad, Klaus... that you ran away before it hit.
But that was the whole idea!
I'm not an idiot!
It flew forwards and the lens -
Look, the lens flew off!
That was the whole idea!
The rocks came closer and closer...
And in the panic I screamed-
"The engine.! The engine.!"
Then there was a crash, and the lens flew off...
so it isn't a question of timing.!
Before Herzog can get the ship back to camp...
it runs aground on a sandbank.
He can't film the final scenes in Iquitos without the ship...
so he has to wait for the rainy season to flood the river and lift it off the sand.
But as month follows month in the longest dry season in recorded history...
the ship remains stuck.
The other ship is stuck too- at the bottom of the hill.
In fact, the whole film is stuck.
If I believed in the devil,
I would say the devil was right here...
and is still right here.
It becomes very questionable because, uh... people have lost their lives.
People have been in a plane crash, and five of them in critical condition - one of them paralyzed.
And those are all the costs that you have to pay.
It could have hit me... or anyone.
And one starts to question the - the profession itself.
What are your plans when this movie's all over? What are you gonna be doing?
I shouldn't make movies anymore.
I should go to a lunatic asylum right away.
But I don't know.
It's, uh -
Very much of it is - is too crazy and too, uh -
Just not - not what a man should do in his life all the time.
And I feel, uh -
If- Even if I get that boat over the mountain and somehow I finish that film... anyone can congratulate me and talk me into finding it marvelous.
I - Nobody on this earth will convince me to be happy about all that.
Not - Not until the end of my days.
Herzog's film ends with Fitzcarraldo achieving a victory of sorts.
He sells his battered steamship and makes just enough money...
to bring a small-time opera troupe to Iquitos for a single performance.
In the end, Herzog won a painful victory ofhis own.
After months of work, using heavier equipment and a new engineering crew from Lima...
he pulled the ship to the top of the hill...
and in November, 1981...
almost four years after preproduction began...
the last shot of Fitzcarraldo was completed.
It's not only my dreams.
My belief is that all these dreams are- are yours as well.
And the only distinction between me and you is that I can articulate them.
And that is what poetry or painting or literature or filmmaking is all about.
It's as simple as that.
And I - I make films because...
I have not learned anything else.
And I know I can do it to a certain degree.
And it is my duty...
because this, uh...
might be the- the inner chronicle of what we are.
And we have to articulate ourselves...
otherwise we would be cows in the field.

Just to see it roll out all completely done.
First time we've ever seen it away from the scaffolding.
It's a big difference.
It looked like a newborn bird.
-It's beautiful now.
-I want to see it fly.
At the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Columbia...
...the world's first true spaceship moves to the launch pad.
Its powerful new engines have been tried out one at a time on a test bed.
Now in a last critical test, they will be fired all together...
...on the ship.
We have pad shutdown of all three engines.
Columbia's engines will hurl it up into orbit.
Its wings will let it glide back down to Earth.
And then, unlike any craft before...
...it will be able to rocket again into space.
Launch is in forty-nine days.
John Young is commander of Columbia's test flight.
Robert Crippen is the pilot.
They're both graduate engineers, fighter pilots, test pilots...
...and have come through the tough weeding out that qualifies astronauts.
They were chosen as first crew for Columbia three years ago...
...and since then they have been studying and practicing for the first flight.
Bob Crippen hasn't been in space yet.
John Young is a veteran.
He's been up there four times, logging more than five hundred hours...
...seventy-one of them on the moon.
Not so long ago, mankind was stuck on Earth.
Now, flying is easy for us.
The purpose of Columbia is to make space...
...as available to us as planes have made the air.
It was on the moon that John Young heard that the shuttle program was approved.
John, this is perfect with the LEM, the rover and you...
...and Stone Mountain.
And the old flag.
Come out here and give me a salute, a big Navy salute.
Okay, here we go, a big one.
Off the ground. One more.
This looks like a good time for some good news.
The House passed its space budget yesterday...
...which includes a vote for the shuttle.
Wonderful.
The country needs that shuttle mighty bad.
You'll see.
Nine years later, Columbia, the first shuttle, is ready to go.
But there are worries.
Some of its most vital components are new and untried.
Like the blanket of tiles...
...that will protect it from the fierce heat of reentry into the Earth's atmosphere.
The press has been watching anxiously.
Were there times when Mr. Young had to,
I don't know how to say it delicately...
...reassure you as to the safety of the endeavor?
Actually he reassures me.
I know you don't have the capability of repairing the tiles...
...but if something happens to the tile, is there anything you can do?
Oh, the tiles?
The tiles are in good shape.
We are not going to have to repair tiles.
They're fixed.
Let's wait for the mike.
It's still not completely clear to me...
...whether or not you can abort with the ejection seats...
...during the burn of the solids.
You just pull the little handle.
John, I think you talked around the question...
...of what happens if you have a serious tile problem.
What happens if you have a serious tile problem?
How serious is the tile problem?
I think you're a better judge of what would be a serious tile problem than anyone here. lf you don't have any tiles on the bottom, the vehicle will burn up. lf you have a lot of tiles on the bottom, it won't burn up.
You could lose a single tile in a certain area...
...and I don't think it'll do anything to you, my personal opinion is. l've heard people say there's going to be a zipper effect.
There isn't a zipper effect.
Each one of those tiles is put on individually.
And they're designed four to five times...
...the strength that they need for the dynamic pressure they will see.
Okay, let's take two more questions, and then close it. ls it fun to be an astronaut? ls it fun to be an astronaut?
That is a very good question.
-And the answer is yes, yes, yes.
-You betcha.
It really is.
I don't think you could do it unless it was fun.
This is the egress training down at the Cape.
This is how they were showing us how...
...to take the slide wire down into the bunker area down there.
They explained to me how to do it.
Of course, I'm very nervous about that,
I thought they were going to turn us loose.
The slide wire is a quick escape route...
...in case there's trouble just before the launch.
There's a couple of sandbags in there, shows you what kind of trip it will be.
Once you get down, you can either go into a bunker...
...or you can climb into the M-13 tank...
...and drive out through the side gate. lmagine being on a space crew and learning how to drive a tank.
You drive this thing up the road.
You see that fence over there?
You just go right through the fence.
Columbia's flight will be the first time...
...a crew will be aboard an untested rocket.
Every foreseeable emergency, such as an abort into a Florida lake...
...is plotted and rehearsed again and again.
At about METplus thirty minutes...
...the checklist has:
"Take anti-motion sickness medication." ls that a crew option or a request based on an assumption...
...that an ounce of prevention is better than a bag of upchuck?
Commander Young, as you know, has had a lot of space experience...
...and has never had even stomach awareness.
We feel he is not in need of medication.
Since this is Pilot Crippen's first flight...
...he is going to take it as an ounce of prevention.
Bob and I are about ready to fly this thing.
We get another hop in the simulator to spruce everything up a little.
We're really looking forward to flying.
We hope that everything will allow us to go on Friday.
It sure looks good for that right now.
The crew is in fine shape.
They had a good rest last night.
And we're looking forward to a real good flight.
We're in good shape now.
Right now there is nothing standing in the way of launch.
Liftoff is still scheduled for 6:50.
That's less than one hour from now.
And I don't have to tell you there is an electric excitement here.
The world is watching this historic event.
This is Shuttle Launch Control.
The countdown is at T minus thirty-three minutes, ten seconds and counting.
At present, everything is going smoothly.
We're looking for a launch on time at 7:00 a.m. this morning.
This is Shuttle Launch Control.
We're presently at T minus nine minutes and holding...
...but a decision has been made to recycle the count...
...to the T-minus-twenty-minute point.
At the present time, the ground people...
...are working a problem with the backup computer compare tests.
We're standing by to hear...
...what the resolution of that particular problem might be.
We have a repeat of no communication with streams 1 to 3.
Do you have any proposals at this time?
Two computers are not interconnecting.
It has never happened in tests.
Haven't had any other input...
...that would lead us towards any other course of action.
This is Shuttle Launch Control.
During the countdown...
...we have not been able to get the computers talking to each other properly.
At the present time we have terminated our launch attempt for today.
We will reschedule for no earlier...
...than Sunday morning at 6:50 a.m.
Eastern Standard Time.
This is Shuttle Launch Control.
Tell us how the astronauts were affected...
...by the long wait inside the capsule yesterday...
...and what their spirits are today in preparation for tomorrow's launch.
I think they were as disappointed as all of us were...
...but I don't think they had any physical problem. l talked to John Young a couple hours after we scrubbed...
...and he was in very good spirits, and he said....
He's an old veteran.
He said, "George, these things are gonna happen, we know that...
"...and we're ready to go tomorrow."
Their spirits are still good.
Through you today, we all feel as giants once again.
Once again, we feel the surge of pride...
...that comes from knowing we are the first, we are the best...
...and we are so because we are free.
For all Americans, Nancy and I thank you...
...and the thousands of others who have worked to make this day possible.
May God bless you...
...and may God bring you safely home to us again.
A message from President Reagan...
...which began, "You go forward this morning, a daring enterprise...
"...and take the hopes and prayers of all Americans with you."
T minus one minute, twenty seconds and counting.
We can see the purges of the main engines...
...as we prepare for ignition.
T minus one minute, ten seconds and counting.
Liquid hydrogen tank is at flight pressure.
T minus one minute mark and counting.
-GC, Flight.
-Go, Flight. ls the MlLA problem the entire S-band or just ranging?
-It's just the tracking data, Flight.
-But it's everything: angles, ranging.
-Everything.
-Okay.
T minus forty seconds and counting.
The development flight instrumentation recorders are on.
T minus thirty-five seconds.
We're a few seconds away from switching to the redundant set sequencer.
T minus twenty-seven seconds.
We've gone for redundant set sequencer start.
T minus twenty seconds and counting.
T minus fifteen, fourteen, thirteen.
T minus ten, nine, eight...
...seven, six, five, four.
We have gone for main engine start.
-External tank separation.
-Fly out, John.
-We confirm the separation.
-Looks like the EVAP may have shut down.
Look at this stuff floating around here.
-Roger.
-Super. That's okay.
The view has changed, and it's really something else.
John's been telling me about it for three years...
...but ain't no way you can describe it.
It's hard to get my head in the cockpit here and do my procedures.
-Roger, copy here.
-What's your status here, GNC?
-We look good.
-Guidance. Drop booster.
-Did your dumping work, Jack?
-Yeah, looks good.
CAPCOM going over the hill.
We see two good ones.
We'll see them at Madrid. Configure LOS.
Columbia, Houston. We have forty seconds until LOS. Configure LOS.
You're looking good burning over the hill.
We'll see you at Madrid.
Early in the flight, the doors of the payload bay are checked. lf the doors get stuck open, it'll be impossible to return to Earth.
They work fine, but what they reveal is worrying.
Okay, what camera are y'all looking at right now? Do you know?
Roger, we're looking out the forward camera.
Okay, we want to show y'all we do have a few tiles missing...
...off the starboard pod.
It's got basically what appears to be three tiles and some smaller pieces.
And off the port pod, it looks like I see one full square...
...and it looks like a few little triangular shapes that are missing.
We're trying to put that on TV right now.
Roger, Crip, we can see that good. ln the judgment of Mission Control, the damage is not critical.
But nobody can be sure that tiles aren't missing on Columbia's underside. lf the shuttle works as hoped, we'll be able to bring up into orbit...
...better satellites and even take them back down for repairs. ln zero gravity, we'll be able to make new materials...
...pure medicines, alloys, crystals.
Perhaps tap solar power, build space stations.
And here, outside the veil of Earth's atmosphere...
...we can operate scientific instruments...
...like telescopes that let us look more deeply into the universe.
We're coming up on this photograph time.
You don't want me taking anything unless I see something, do you?
That's affirmative.
We are 1 70 miles up.
Columbia is on its back.
That's the famous Mount Fuji in Japan.
The 1,000-foot-high
Tifernine Dunes of Algeria. lrrigation canals in the Sacramento Valley.
The Himalayas, the highest mountains on Earth.
Turn right around.
Right around.
Turn around here.
Big historical event, right?
Enough space out here, anyway.
Now Columbia will try to glide back down from space.
There's no going around for a second try.
The landing site is Edwards Air Force Base...
...where there's lots of room for error.
This is Mission Control.
Box One has lost its signal now.
Columbia is in the proper attitude for deorbit.
After the deorbit maneuver,
John Young will...
...pitch Columbia down and bring it to entry attitude.
At an elapsed time of two days, five hours, fifteen minutes...
...this is Mission Control, Houston.
I gotta see it.
Why?
I went down to Florida twice...
...saw the rockets go up in the daytime and one at night.
So I just had to see it.
Why did the chicken cross the road?
Why are we sitting in the middle of the desert? It's beautiful.
We're enjoying it.
We're waiting for the space shuttle.
I'm here because I'm an American.
I'm so glad John let me have the day off so I could get here early.
I'll ask John Young personally if he saw this.
A bunch of happy people.
Everyone's having a good time, no problems at all. ln moments, Columbia will dive down into the intense heat of reentry.
Only John Young and Bob Crippen...
...will know if their shield of protective tiles is working.
The burning air around them will block all radio communication. ln the life-and-death minutes that follow, there will be only silence.
Columbia, everything looks perfect going over the hill.
Nice and easy does it, John.
We're all riding with you.
Bye-bye.
Mission Control, chase planes are taking off now at Edwards. ln the control center, the backup crew for this mission...
...astronauts Joe Engle and Dick Truly behind the CAPCOMs.
The convoy crew is all ready to go out there.
They're the crew that will safe the orbiter...
...and help with the power-down.
Stand by for mark on 9,700 feet per second.
Hello there, Houston? Columbia's here.
Hello, Columbia, Houston's here.
How do you read?
We're doing Mach 10.3 at 180 A.S.
And we couldn't agree more.
Your state vector's good.
We've got good data in house.
Okay.
Flight, FlDO, I look exactly nominal.
Columbia's reentry is expected to produce a mild sonic boom...
...centered a few miles west of
Edwards Air Force Base.
What a way to come to California.
Flight, FlDO, I still look perfect, right on the nominal.
It looks real good underneath.
"Fido" says it couldn't be any better.
280 knots.
Everything looks real good.
-2,500 feet.
-Clear.
They're coming.
They're down.
Fifty feet.
Forty, thirty, twenty, ten.
Five, four, three...
...two, one, touchdown!
We are here. Testing.
Five, four, three, touchdown.
Heck of a job, Skipper!
Welcome home. Beautiful.
Do you want us to take it up to the hangar, Joe?
We're going to dust it off first.
It's the world's greatest flying machine,
I'll tell you that. It was super.
This is Mission Control, Houston.
The unofficial touchdown time:
Two days, six hours, twenty minutes, fifty-two seconds.
As Columbia's main gear touched the lakebed...
...the flight director's instructions were:
"Prepare for exhilaration."
Welcome back.
Hail, Columbia.
This is Susan...
...the best thing that ever happened to me.
It was a really tremendous mission...
...from start to finish.
Crippen is one of the hardest workers I know...
...and he carried me through that whole thing.
I think we've got a fantastic and remarkable capability here.
The human race is really not too far from going to the stars.
You know, when you ride a launch vehicle...
...the future of the standard launch vehicle of the United States of America...
...if it doesn't work right, if all those engines don't work right...
...you don't get very far downrange.
The space shuttle worked perfectly.
It was a beautiful thing.
We really have something here.
I saw a newspaper headline...
...that expressed it far better than I could.
It showed a space shuttle orbiter and it said:
"The dream is alive again."
Let's keep it that way.
There is still one more hurdle.
The most important one of all.
Columbia returns to the Kennedy Space Center...
...to prove that it can do what it was designed to do:
To go up again into space.
