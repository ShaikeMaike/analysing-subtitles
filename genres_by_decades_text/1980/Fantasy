- Good morning, Mr. Seymour.
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Seymour.
- Morning, Angela.
- Morning, Mr. Seymour.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
- Charlie, let's go!
- Is Dad coming tonight, Mom?
- I left a message on his machine.
- Call him again. Sometimes he forgets.
- See you, Cliff.
- See you.
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye.
Sam, I have to get budget approval for this South China Seas thing.
That means we have to go over your wish list.
Not now. I'm looking at furs at 10. I've got menswear people in from Atlanta.
Where were you this morning?
I woke up and you'd gone.
I told you I had my exercise class.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Morning, Sam.
- Hi, Sam.
- Yo, Marshall.
- Yo, Marshall.
I hear he's taking Sam on this Far East junket.
She's a fashion buyer.
She's a logical choice.
So the fact that he's boffing her has nothing to do with it?
- I said she's a logical choice.
- Oh, cute. Cute.
Confirm lunch with Davidson.
He's from L.A. Better make it sushi.
I'm going to my kid's concert.
You gotta have me out of here by 5.
Good morning.
Unbelievable.
Sorry.
- See you later.
- Bye. Yeah.
- Charlie.
- Hi, Dad.
Charlie, what can I say?
You can't believe the problems I had.
When I get back from my trip, you're staying with me?
- Yeah.
- When Mom's on vacation?
Charlie, I'm gonna make it up to you. I swear.
That's okay, Dad.
We've played better.
I guess I'll just have to buy the album.
Hi. Come on, Charlie. If we're gonna get a pizza, we gotta move it.
Let's go, Charlie.
My friends, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome, Mr. Seymour, Miss Crespi, to Thailand.
We hope you love our country...
...and buy so many things to take back to America.
- Cheers.
- Cheers. Thank you.
Mr. Turk, long time. Long time.
If this business doesn't kill me, the stairs will. I hope the climb's won'th it.
- Same old Mr. Turk.
- Right.
- You look good.
- Yeah, a regular movie star.
What do you got for me?
Always business first, huh, Mr. Turk?
- What's with lmelda?
- Nothing. Old Lady. Superstitious.
- It's real gold.
- Yes.
Very rare. From Tibet.
The lamas believe in reincarnation.
They use it in religious ceremonies to change the house of spirit.
Don't try to up the ante with that tourist bullshit, Kwo. Five grand.
Five thousand dollars?
Pure gold! Precious stone!
I think in America you get $ 100,000.
You know how many payoffs
I gotta make to get this to America?
Thais come down harder on art lovers like me than they do on dope dealers.
Five grand. Take it or leave it.
What did you say?
I tell him this one's fragile, so take great care.
Hey, I want this to go with the rest of the samples. $ 1.50.
I bought all the guy had.
The store puts a lampshade on this...
...retails for, what, 75, 80?
Nothing like a 600-percent markup to put a smile on your face.
- These will be on our flight tomorrow?
- Yes. Government deal.
- No problem with customs.
- Okay, I'd like this to go too, please.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Excuse me. Incredibly sorry.
Where did they come from? They werert there when I went to the phone.
You've been gone for a half an hour, Marshall.
I swear to God, that's it for work.
How are the drinks?
Look at you. You're lethal, right?
Can we have a couple more of these?
I have plans for tonight.
Tonight, we'll experience the wonder of Marshall Seymour in the Orient.
I promise.
If you don't, I'm gonna show everyone this at work.
- No, you're not. I don't think so.
- I think so.
I don't think you will. No.
- Why don't I take one of the two of you.
- Great.
- Thanks.
- My pleasure.
That's great.
- Where you from, New York?
- England.
Fernando in Milan will flip when he sees these.
They're woven, not printed, so he can design a range of V & A exclusives...
...and we can make them up in Bangkok.
Sorry I'm late, Mr. Avery. I've been busy putting everything together.
- One of your happy snaps, Marshall?
- Give me that, Floyd.
- May I see?
- Sure.
Just a rare moment of leisure, sir.
We had to eat!
If you ever go, sir,
I recommend the Drunken Fish.
As long as the trip wasrt entirely pleasurable.
Since you left...
...there have been strong doubts about your South China Seas promotion.
I can imagine.
At the moment, there is a complete uniformity of approach...
...to marketing in this city.
Our competition is selling the same merchandise we are in the same way.
This Eastern concept is exotic, provocative, exciting.
- Passion.
- As I've said before...
...we have to make sure our marketing strategy is more aggressive...
...more imaginative than the other guys'.
With this in mind...
...I think you'll see we've made very exciting acquisitions on our trip.
Let me show you this little sucker.
I'm estimating a profit of six to 700 percent.
That's why I bought 5000 of them.
You bought how many?
Could I speak to Mr. Seymour, please?
Mr. Marshall Seymour.
Yes, of course I'll hold.
You are unbelievable.
I know people who'd pay a fortune for this and you send it to Chicago.
Couldrt you find a mule coming to New York?
What did you expect? An ad in the
Bangkok Post: "Smugglers Wanted"?
It was sloppy to use a civilian.
Mr. Seymour...
...Lillian Brookmeyer. I believe we were on the same flight from Bangkok.
And there seems to have been a terrible mix-up.
I seem to have this darling blue and white ginger jar...
...and I wonder if you have something of mine.
Don't ask me how it happened. It's fortunate I'll be in Chicago tomorrow...
Monday would be fine. Yes.
At your office? Look forward to it.
- Look forward to Chicago in December?
- Come on, it's in the U.S.
- Monday, it's ours. No problem.
- You think so?
Credit me with some intelligence.
On what basis?
Major, major, major dork.
Attention K-Mart shoppers:
This offer cannot be repeated.
Dooley, who you got?
I got Blackhawks and Whalers,
Van Halen at the Civic, and Malice.
- Can you get tickets for Wang Chung?
- Sure.
- Get me two for Malice.
- Two? Who you taking? Lori?
I don't go out with boys.
Will your dad let you go?
I'll get him to take me.
He owes me one.
I can hear you people in the parking lot. Dooley, get out!
Out! You're not scalping tickets in my classroom.
Sit down! Take off that headset and give me that filthy magazine.
Go, Charlie!
Yes, yes! Come on, come on!
Go, go, go, Charlie!
Come on, touchdown!
All right! All right!
You're really sparking them, Charlie.
All right, touchdown!
Hi, guys.
- Come on.
- Let's go. We can afford them now.
- Over here! Over here!
- Get the ball!
- I got them!
- Run! Run!
- Quick, throw it!
- I'm open. Open.
- Who's that?
- My dad.
- I'm sorry about that, Marshall.
- No, come on, it was a good pass.
It was never my game, you know?
I used to row.
No, I meant the sweater.
It looks like it's expensive.
I get a good deal at the store.
You want one? I could get you one.
Charlie, get your stuff together.
- See you.
- See you later, Charlie.
This is the hotel we're staying in if there's any kind of problem.
He eats Nerds for breakfast, not croissants.
Help him with homework.
He has exams.
You have to see his homeroom teacher
Tuesday afternoon.
Tuesday afternoon? Oh, my God!
I've got to meet with our ad agency.
Cancel it. It won't kill you to be a parent for a week.
Christ.
Charlie? No, Charlie. Please.
Charlie, no way.
I got a clause in my lease.
Okay, old buddy, you unload your arsenal...
- Hey, you got a tree!
- Yeah.
Sure. Of course I got you a tree.
Well, Sam got it for you.
Look at the pine needles.
Goddamn it! I told her.
I told her there'd be pine needles all over the rug.
I'm gonna check my messages.
Hi, Mo.
Did you have a nice ride?
Were you okay in there?
Look, this is my dad's den.
I'm gonna sleep on the bed.
And you're gonna sleep in here.
We won't tell my dad you're staying.
There's probably a clause in his lease.
Why can't you take me to school?
George Ferriera takes his kid to school on his way to work.
- I go in the opposite direction.
- You don't know Dale.
- He's a real asshole.
- Charlie!
Language, in front of Sam.
Pasquale.
- Is he a real asshole?
- Major.
A little Grey Poupon.
Thank you.
I can't take you to school, but I'll do anything else you want. Deal?
Can we see Malice at the Riviera?
Is that an Agatha Christie movie?
It's a heavy-duty rock band.
I'll get us both a ticket.
- No way. You have tests.
- Music is my life, Dad!
- You had a deal.
- Oh, come on. He has tests this week.
You can't expect me to take him to one of those drugged-out rock shows.
- Where'd he go?
- He's upset.
- What's he got to be upset about?
- Just lighten up, okay?
Charlie.
What are you doing?
- Mo has escaped.
- Who's Mo?
My frog.
Damn it.
- Pasquale, we have a problem.
- The linguine is not al dente?
My frog! My frog!
- It's a rat!
- It's not a rat! It's my frog!
- It's not the linguine.
- Mo, where are you?
Jesus Christ.
What is this, a rummage sale?
Charlie.
I can't believe you're this messy at your mom's.
You stay with me a few days, all hell breaks loose. Look at this.
Charlie!
In the future, eat in the kitchen!
There's granola all over the rug.
Make sure you take that damn frog back to school.
If I do, they'll dissect him.
That's what a frog is for.
This isn't a wildlife refuge.
People are always trying to save whales and baby seals and stuff.
- What's wrong with saving a frog?
- He's not staying here.
If we're not wanted here, we can go stay with Eric.
Oh, really? I guess at Eric's house there's a frog in every room.
Look, I just can't believe what you did last night, that's all.
I can't ever go back to that restaurant after your friend went table-hopping.
- Stop dumping on me, Dad!
- I'm not dumping on you.
I've been up since 6, and I have a very tough day ahead.
I have a tough day ahead too.
You're going to school, for God's sake.
School is games, fun and goofing off.
It's the best time of your life.
You mean it gets worse?
Wait till you have to work.
You'll find out how much worse.
- I told you to leave that alone.
- You don't take tests at work.
I bet people don't push you around, calling you "shrimp" and "microbe."
You know, I wish I could change places with you.
Yeah? Well, I wish I could too.
Dad!
Charlie! Charlie!
Dad?
Daddy!
Charlie!
Daddy!
You look just like me.
I think I am you...
...Dad.
And you're me.
Holy shit!
Dad?
Dad?
- What's happening, Dad?
- Son of a bitch!
I'm scared.
Don't cry, Charlie. It's a dream.
We're having a dream.
The same dream?
We woke up a half an hour ago!
If we're dreaming, you won't feel this.
There must be a perfectly logical explanation for this.
Maybe this happened all over America.
Invasion of the Body Switchers.
Your mother lets you watch too much television.
It's some kind of hallucination.
I shouldn't have taken all that Valium.
Hey, this is neat.
It can happen.
People do have nervous breakdowns.
Yeah.
Right.
That was Dale's father.
He's picking you up in 20 minutes.
Oh, my God, this is for real.
It was this.
You were holding it. You said...
I know what I said.
I said I wish we could change places.
Somebody must have thought it was a pretty good idea, because we have.
So you better get dressed, because you're going to school in 20 minutes.
Don't be crazy. I can't go to school.
It'd look pretty weird if I go to school.
I must weigh 200 pounds.
A hundred and seventy-six.
Give me that! Give it back!
Give that to me! Give that back!
- Nope!
- Give it back!
You can ride with Dale.
You can look at Mrs. Luttrell.
And you can take my tests.
I'll get straight A's. Awesome!
We are not leaving this apartment.
Try and remember,
I am still your father.
Try and remember,
I'm bigger than you now.
Oh, my God! My report! I was supposed to get it to Avery today.
Call Marcie. Tell her I'm sick.
You're sick.
- Hey, that's my wallet.
- You'll need some lunch money.
- Look at all this plastic!
- Don't even think it.
It's been a long while since you went to school, Dad.
- What do you mean?
- It's not like Happy Days anymore.
All I'm saying is...
...be careful out there.
- Hi, how you doing?
- I've known better days, George.
- Excuse me?
- I mean, Mr. Ferriera.
Raccoon turd.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.
Son of a bitch.
Hey, Charlie.
Was Maggot Mouth giving you a bad time?
He's a depressing indictment of our educational system.
Oh, you mean he's like a moron?
- So how's it with your dad?
- Why do you ask?
You said you didn't think staying there would be much fun.
My father is a wonderful person.
People don't realize that he's under enormous pressure.
Hey, if you guys are interfacing, that's cool.
- Who are you, anyway?
- You're getting weird, Charlie.
Well, I gotta go.
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
I have a problem. Could you tell me where I'm supposed to go?
You suppose your amnesia is induced by piping heavy-metal music...
...into your brain cells?
I asked a perfectly straightforward question.
I'd appreciate a straightforward answer.
Keep the change.
- Good morning, Mr. Seymour.
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Seymour.
- Hi.
- Good morning, Mr. Seymour.
- Good morning.
Morning, Mr. Seymour.
Careful! Get back! Get back!
- Yo, Marshall.
- Yo, Marshall.
- Yo, Marshall.
- Hi. I mean, yo.
Boy, did Braverman luck out.
That's his newest temp.
You ever seen such an available mouth? I bet it's nice in there.
Be a good place to set up camp.
- Tom Sawyer's swimming hole, eh?
- Yeah.
Is my office down here?
It's where it always was, unless you know something we don't.
Thanks.
- Sneakers.
- I know. He's losing it.
Elliot Webb was like that right before his breakdown.
Week after that, he was in a window wearing the new Balenciaga ball gown.
Morning, Marshall.
- Marcie?
- Yes?
Good morning, Marcie.
I trust you had a pleasant weekend.
Are you all right?
Don't I look all right?
In four years, you've never asked me about my weekend.
Sorry.
I kept your appointments light so you could finish your report.
It's finished!
I got it right here!
Good.
If you want me,
I'll be in my office. Okay?
Great.
Good. I need some envelopes...
...and some pencils.
Some pens.
Look, Mo.
Downtown.
It's a big city.
A Jacuzzi for you.
Cool out, pal.
It must have been hot in there, huh?
I was just exercising.
Chair aerobics?
- Yes?
- I need to make a phone call.
You're in the middle of a test.
I finished.
Sit down!
Well, do you have a newspaper?
- Sam!
- I can't have lunch today.
There's too much to catch up on.
Great to see you.
Which is a shame, because we need to talk.
Is there a problem?
Basically, I just don't know whether working together...
...and having a relationship is feasible.
I don't know what "feasible" means.
Nor do I anymore.
That's just the point.
I'll do anything you want, Sam.
Marshall, it's not what I want.
It's what we want as a unit...
...if we are still a unit.
When we get together tomorrow night,
I think we have to be open...
...and candid and re-evaluate this whole situation.
Okay?
Okay.
Bye.
This is Marshall. Can't come to the phone. Leave a message.
Oh, my God! He's out!
Hey, kid, I gotta use the phone.
And I need to speak to my secretary.
Do you mind?
Mr. Seymour's office.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Marcie, thank God!
Who is this?
It's me, Charlie.
Hi, Charlie. Your daddy's told me so much about you.
- Never mind that. Did my dad show up?
- Sure.
I don't believe it.
How could he do this to me?
Let me speak to him.
He just stepped out to lunch.
If he behaves a little silly today, it's probably the jet lag.
So don't make any appointments, and keep Avery off his back.
That was Marshall's kid. The little prick sounds just like his father.
I don't suppose you have any Grey Poupon?
What?
Hey, watch it, Dale.
We're sorry about that.
I didn't mean to.
Hey, the assholes are taking over the world, man.
Consolation. The Dool has delivered.
What's in there, drugs?
Your concert tickets.
I want cash tomorrow.
Checks will only be accepted when accompanied by two major credit cards.
- Mrs. Brookmeyer to see you.
- Who?
You made the appointment yourself on Friday.
Did I?
Come on.
Mr. Seymour, good of you to find the time.
How you doing?
I wrote a savage letter to the airline president. I urge you to do the same.
Sure.
I imagine your store will put a handsome markup on that.
I guess.
So...
...do you have my little objet d'art?
I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about.
Mr. Seymour, when we spoke on the phone Friday...
...you knew exactly what I was talking about.
Well, a lot's happened since Friday.
Oh, really?
Really.
I see. Maybe since Friday you realized what you got.
Maybe you had it valued and think you can make a few bucks.
- Is that what you're trying to pull?
- You have to talk to my dad.
I didn't fly in from New York to be jerked around.
And you and your dad better think about this.
Because let me tell you something, buster...
...you're dealing with a major ball-breaker here.
Wow! A ball-breaker.
- I need to make a call.
- There's a pay phone in the cafeteria.
There's a line a mile long, and this is an emergency.
Yeah, my name is Seymour.
My account number is 4126.
I need a limo at Hemingway
Junior High, ASAP.
Right.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- Where are you going, Marshall?
- Nowhere.
- What's with you today?
- Nothing.
You've been acting weird all day.
Go home. Take a pill.
Okay.
Look, we're not going to a funeral.
Peel rubber, pal.
Good afternoon, Mr. Seymour.
Hi.
Coleman, sir.
- That thing is intense.
- State of the art, sir.
- How much does it cost?
- A little under $ 7000.
That's more than a Datsun.
- Pretty hot lick.
- I know.
I play the drums.
Go for it.
Nice fill, Mr. Seymour.
Wait.
- He famous?
- He will be. I'm gonna kill him!
- I know why Marshall's acting so weird.
- It's obvious.
Marshall's out on a limb over this South China Seas deal.
- No, he's just sucking up to Avery.
- Lf this thing takes a nosedive...
...he'll be lucky to run the hardware department.
Yeah, in the South China Seas.
Oh, that's right.
- Have you been on the fourth floor?
- No, sir.
Apparently, Marshall is in the music department playing the drums.
- Don't stop now, we're really wailing!
- It's Mr. Avery, Mr. Seymour.
What's going on?! This is
Vigar & Avery, not a nightclub.
Chill out. I was...
He's a customer.
You're a vice president of this company, not a salesman.
- Salesperson, Mr. Avery.
- Person.
All those years of hard work and my career is down the crapper.
- Did you pick out a Christmas present?
- Sylvia!
Stratford! Charles was just saying at dinner last night...
...we don't see enough of Stratford.
- Was he?
I was at the club Thursday, but you were in Bermuda.
We're in town for at least a month.
Call us.
- Wrap what he wants and deliver it.
- This will do fine.
Nice jamming with you.
Well done, Marshall. I never would have recognized the boy.
And you know how much money his mother spends here.
Business is war, gentlemen.
Gentlepersons.
Without sales, we might as well raise the white flag and surrender...
...to the forces of Neiman Marcus.
Marshall didn't forget that.
Learn.
Hi, Dad.
What did you do to my nose?
What?
What?
I wish we could change back again.
- Nothing.
- Dad, this is heavy.
- What if we're stuck like this?
- Oh, my God.
I'll have to go through puberty again.
What's gonna happen to you?
You're 6' 2" with the brain of an 11 -year-old.
Maybe the ball-buster had something to do with it?
- What?
- This lady brought your jar back.
- She said you had something of hers.
- The lady who called me Friday.
- Of course. It belongs to her.
- She was really mad.
- She wanted to bust your balls.
- There's not much to bust, kid.
You'll have to go back to work tomorrow. She's our only link.
- Yeah?
- Charlie, is that you?
- Oh, my God, it's your mother.
- Well, talk to her. You're me.
Hello? Charlie, you there?
Yo, Mom. How's it going?
Not too good. Cliff forgot to fasten the mosquito net last night.
- How are things with you and your dad?
- Different.
Anyway, this is an expensive call.
You still my Charlie Bear?
- Oh, come on, tell Mommy.
- I'm still your Charlie Bear. Good night.
I hate it when she pulls that Charlie Bear stuff.
She gets back this weekend.
If we don't resolve this...
...l'll have to live with her again.
This is the woman I couldn't live with as a husband.
And now I'm gonna be her son.
It's a Freudian nightmare.
- Good morning, Mr. Seymour.
- Yo.
- Good morning, Marshall.
- Yo. Yo.
- Yo, Marshall.
- Hi, Sam.
The Jingle Bell Moose, Marshall.
We've been getting complaints.
- What's the problem?
- What's the problem?
Wow! It said what I said.
It's supposed to do that.
You squeeze the antler.
Some talk gibberish. A woman in Kenilwon'th, hers swore in Polish.
Can I keep this one?
- Well, yeah, sure. It's your call.
- Fine. Run with it, babe.
I think they're trying to pass the buck,
Marshall. Or in this case, the moose.
Moose.
How are we today?
Fine.
Oh, Marcie, if that lady who came here yesterday calls back...
...I need to talk to her, okay?
- Okay.
Your kid's school called to confirm an appointment with his teacher.
Right. Anything else?
The janitor left a note to say there's a frog in your bathroom.
Oh, no. I forgot!
We need some flies or insects!
He must be starving!
Come on, come on.
I won't be able to do the science fair!
Give it back! Give it back!
Come on. Please.
- Come on, guys.
- What's going on here?
- They've got my project.
- Great odds.
It takes three of you to harass this child.
- Go screw yourself, ass-wipe.
- Oh, a prospective English major.
Now, give the young lady her project and we'll forget all about this.
Hey, hey, come on.
Give her her stuff back.
Oh, man!
- Oh, yeah! All right!
- You got his ass good.
Name in the top, right-hand corner.
Let's try to make it legible, Corey.
Melissa, this does not require a discussion from you.
Pencils down, people, test is over.
Available in calfskin or alligator, combination lock...
...built-in digital timepiece and a rather unique anti-personnel device.
For your type of skin, I would recommend our facial scrub.
It's clinically formulated, allergy-tested...
As an extra, we offer a concealed compartment...
...to contain a poisonous gas of your choice.
Could I interest you in an eye-contour gel?
It works wonders.
Yeah!
- We have to talk.
- Wait.
I'm about to beat my all-time personal best.
- You know what this is?
- I'm not a salesman, sir.
- I'm an executive vice president.
- Yo, Marshall.
Marshall.
It's the moose again. Now we've got two consumer groups on our backs.
I say we tough it out.
What, you'll recall those mooses?
Moose.
The plural for moose is "moose."
- What, you're gonna say "gooses"?
- "Geese." You're saying it's "meese"?
- I don't know what it is...
- Guys, could we can the semantics?
I played with my moose for 20 minutes and it broke.
- So?
- So...
...it's not fair.
Kid takes it home and it breaks.
We've sold 100,000 of the suckers.
Are you telling me we just call them all in?
Do it!
Handguns are in Sporting Goods, sir.
What are you doing here?
What's going on?
How did she get to become a track coach?
She makes me sick.
Man, you just don't know.
She is so fat, man.
Freeze!
Calhoun, High School Patrol.
Nice try, kid.
Okay, spread! Up against the wall.
You too, tuna breath.
- Look, I only took a drag.
- Did I say you could talk...
...punk?
Word on the street is you barf bags are giving seventh-grade kids a hard time.
- Hey, we were just smoking, man.
- I know what's going down!
You don't wanna draw any heat, you'll get off their case.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's cool.
Hey, butt-heads, come here.
I'm gonna be back in half an hour...
...and those bowls had better be gleaming.
- Hi, Dad.
- What are you doing here?
You never said you had to see my teacher.
You never told me you had hockey practice!
Mr. Seymour.
Hi.
I'm Jane Luttrell.
- Yes, I know.
- I'm happy we have this chance to talk.
I have to be honest,
I'm concerned about Charlie.
- I'm sure you'll agree, he's an enigma.
- A what?
A puzzle. Well, I've already graded yesterday's test papers.
- How did he do?
- Exceptionally well.
Which only confirms what I have suspected all along.
He's working far below his potential.
He's too easily distracted.
He lacks focus. He lacks...
...concentration.
I'm trying to tell you, your son is a dreamer.
- All he thinks about is music.
- He likes music. And you know what?
Maybe one day he'll be a big star.
And you'll ask him to come back and give prizes...
...and maybe he won't because you dumped on him!
I'm the last person to discourage outside interests.
I just wish I could have his attention in my classroom.
Well, maybe he finds your classes totally boring.
Well, it might be something else.
Mr. Seymour...
...this is a little embarrassing.
Charlie may be getting to that age.
Well, frankly,
I think he has a crush on me.
No way!
What do you girls think you're doing? Move it!
Get over here! How many times do
I have to tell you not to bury the puck?
Move it! Move it!
You guys are terrible!
I'm gonna send you back to your mothers! You can't skate!
Can someone tell me what's going on here?!
Am I in the wrong place? Are these the auditions for the Ice Capades?
In the locker room, in the classroom, you guys may be buddies!
Out here, all I want to see is hate!
The city pays this man to shape young minds?
You two, out!
Doug, Charlie, you're in.
- Do you mind if I sit out this one?
- Do I what?
- Acid stomach.
- Get out there!
Move it, Seymour! Hustle, buddy!
What are you waiting for?
Oh, no!
Dad!
What a spaz!
Hope I didn't put in too much vermouth.
You really have the worst of this deal, Dad.
It's funny, I don't remember 11 being this tough.
1964.
I played second base in Little League.
The Beatles were on the radio.
- I saw my first James Bond film.
- James Bond was alive then?
I'm not all that old.
I got married very young.
Your mother and I were still in college.
We were a crazy couple of kids.
Are you sorry?
Of course not.
Otherwise, I wouldn't have had you.
I'll get it, Dad.
Hi, I'm Debbie.
I'm your babysitter.
I forgot. I arranged a sitter because I was seeing Sam tonight.
- I'll go.
- Out of the question.
She's worried about your unit, Dad!
If you stand her up tonight, she may never, ever talk to you again.
Ever.
- Hi, Sam.
- Hi.
- I don't wanna go to Antoine's tonight.
- Fine.
Because I know what will happen if we do.
We'll have a wonderful meal.
I'll drink way too much wine...
...and we'll end up in bed together.
No, we won't.
I'm serious, Marshall.
We need to talk.
Wouldrt you rather go to a concert?
Did you get ahold of tickets to Mahler's Second?
No, it's not Mahler.
These guys are radical!
We want everybody...
...to get their fists in the air!
Let me hear you!
I guess you felt bad about not letting Charlie go to the concert.
So you did the next best thing.
You went to all this trouble just to get him an autograph.
That's really sweet, Marshall.
"To Charlie: Party till you puke.
Love, Malice."
I think Charlie being around is having a very positive effect on you, Marshall.
I mean, tonight you completely disarmed me.
You showed me a person
I really wanna be with.
I want to be with you tonight.
There's some magazines over there.
We could watch MTV.
I think I've heard enough music for one evening.
Besides...
...we don't wanna wake Charlie up.
Why?
I have to leave early.
I've got exercise class in the morning.
I feel sick.
Charlie.
I thought you were still asleep.
I'm too nauseous to sleep.
I don't think he has a temperature.
Why don't you get him a drink of water.
Look what your Dad got for you.
- He took you to this?
- Yeah.
And you know something...
...it was the most fun date
I've ever had with him.
- You mean, you don't usually have fun?
- Sure.
It's just that your dad works so hard, and sometimes he's not always there.
- But you do like him?
- I wouldn't be here if I didn't.
I don't just mean tonight. I mean the big picture, the whole ball of wax.
- Tap water okay?
- No, it isn't!
There's Evian in the icebox.
He really likes you, Sam.
Not always good at saying...
...but he loves you.
You think so?
I know so.
You are really special, Charlie.
Here's your Evian.
- I think I should go.
- What do you think, Charlie?
Absolutely. The forecast says snow.
The roads might get dangerous.
You need your sleep.
You have a tough day tomorrow.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
He's fine.
Good night, my favorite men.
Take care of each other.
Good night.
- Your first kiss, huh?
- I didn't mean to, Dad.
I mean, I wasrt...
- She did it!
- It's okay.
She obviously likes me.
Now that you're me.
What a night.
Taxi!
Okay, here we go.
He's an angel of a man, but I'm telling you, he has absolutely no taste.
I tried to talk him out of it.
Turquoise drapes with a beige carpet.
Beige, criminal.
- Mr. Marshall Seymour, please.
- You just missed him.
Why, that is so wicked of him.
Lillian Brookmeyer, his interior decorator.
Could you be a dear and let us in for a moment?
We're only here to measure up.
Do you know where
Professor Kerschner is?
- Downstairs, in the basement.
- All right, thanks.
Come on.
Professor Kerschner?
- Yes.
- Marshall Seymour.
Marshall Seymour.
It's not here.
I'm not surprised.
You threaten the guy...
...he gets freaked and puts it somewhere safe.
- What are you doing?
- Cleaning up.
No use tipping him off that we were here.
How considerate.
At home, you never lift a finger.
To the lamas, this symbolizes the body's impermanence.
To the lamas, this symbolizes the body's impermanence.
They view it as one of the many houses inabited by the spirit...
...in its ceaseless journey of reincarnation.
- Can I ask a question, professor?
- But of course.
Oh, wait a second,
I have something for you.
Did the lamas believe that the spirit could change places without dying?
It's called transmogrification.
There are such beliefs...
...but they're all in the area of superstition rather than science.
- That's what you think.
- What my dad means...
...is that we should keep an open mind.
- Can I keep this, please?
- No way!
- He can't. We'll never see it again.
- Sit down!
There is a man that I'd love to show it to.
He was a lama before the Chinese invasion.
- Where is he?
- Can we see him?
I'll try to arrange it.
May I keep it?
Dad, did you see my tape deck?
I thought I left it in there.
Cleaning lady must have been here.
She doesn't usually do this good.
You drink a lot, huh, Dad?
Only under stress. I think the last three days come under that category.
Maybe this guru guy will deliver.
I mean, he is a genuine lama.
He is an ex-lama. He's probably one of those spaced-out weirdoes...
...who sell you coloring books at the airports and tell you life is a tulip.
And can you believe our future depends on this flake?
Answer the door.
Go see who it is.
What's wrong?
- Nothing.
- The store said you were sick.
I called the school, they said Charlie's sick.
You werert supposed to be back until Saturday.
Mosquitoes are one thing, but when
Hurricane Claire was coming...
...I said, "Cliff, it's time to go home."
Oh, shit! What are you doing here?
Is that how you greet your mother?
He's drinking.
Marshall, he is drinking!
You're home now, Charlie.
You'll be in your own room tonight with all your own things.
I'm in the tub. Do you mind?
Don't be mad at me, Charlie.
I'm not mad at you.
Mom knows this is not your fault.
Mom knows your father turned you into a foul-mouthed alcoholic.
This is Marshall. I can't come to the phone. Please leave a message. Bye.
Marshall, it's imperative that we resolve this South China Seas situation.
I don't care if you're still sick.
The meeting's at 10.
Oh, boy.
- What does he look like?
- All the little bastards look alike.
I don't know.
Let's hope he's not sick today.
Look at this.
That looks very familiar.
- You got everything?
- Yeah.
I'm making your favorite supper tonight.
- Rack of lamb?
- Tuna fish casserole.
I can't wait.
Arert you forgetting something?
- See you later, Charlie Bear.
- Yeah, bye.
- Yes.
- Tell me, quick. Tell me.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
- Don't kill the shit.
- I'll get him.
- He's on your side.
- Christ!
- He's on your side!
- Quick! Now what am I supposed to...?
What are you doing in a limo?
I don't believe it.
Someone beat us to it.
Look out!
Avery's pissed.
He's called a big meeting.
Avery's called a big meeting?
We're dead.
Not yet, Dad.
Microphone and micro radio transmitter...
...enabling control to monitor the agent in the field's ongoing situation.
Invaluable in drug busts, for example.
How does the agent get his orders?
This is a very popular method, young man.
An antenna concealed in the arm of this eyeglass frame...
...works in combination with this miniature earpiece.
It'll work.
Shall I charge this to your account,
Mr. Seymour?
- Yes.
- Fine.
- I wish that shit had gone to school.
- Take it easy.
- Maybe he's in the bathroom.
- All this time?
Maybe he ate Mexican last night.
Get in there. Do something!
Hello? Hello?
Are you receiving me? Over.
This is Alpha One. Alpha One.
Dad, are you receiving me? Over.
Oh, my God, it works.
- Yeah. Are you receiving me?
- Pretty good. Say something else.
- Am I loud enough?
- Great! That's it!
Marshall?
Are you okay?
I called last night, but I only got your machine.
Robyn came back.
She took Charlie home.
Well, we better go.
They're waiting for us.
- Okay.
- The backstabbers have Avery...
...ready to pull the plug, trash the concept, cancel our orders, everything.
You're the one who'll have to turn this thing around, Marshall.
- Life's too short for this crap.
- You go on in.
I'll be in in a minute.
I know you've given a lot of commitment and energy to this idea.
But you are asking the company to invest a total of... How much, Brad?
6.4 million, sir.
- Yes, but that's over three years.
- That's over three years.
We've been offered favorable interest rates from Hong Kong.
And we've been offered very favorable interest rates from King Kong.
- Hong Kong!
- I mean, from Hong Kong.
Maybe. But what is the most we have ever expended before...
...for a single promotional concept?
1.2 million.
"The Best of Britain Week."
- Now, that made money.
- 1.2 million.
"Best of Britain Week."
That made money.
We would've made more if we thought bigger.
Would've made more if we'd thought bigger.
- This concept is far more imaginative.
- This concept is far more imaginative.
We're taking in textiles, ceramics, sportswear...
...travel, rugs.
It's the size of this thing that make me nervous, sir.
Yes. If the people of Bedford Park find the Orient too exotic...
...we'll end up with a warehouse...
...full of kimonos and ginger jars.
- Asshole!
- Don't say that!
- I don't know.
There won't be room in the warehouse,
Larry. It'll be full of recalled moose?
- What's this?
- Yeah, you never told me about this!
- There wasrt time. Okay?
- Wasrt time for what?
- To tell you about it, sir.
- Tell me what?
Our purchase-with-purchase
Jingle Bell Moose, sir.
A few of them were defective and Marshall recalled 100,000.
Were you deranged?
Kids were getting ripped off. It just seemed like the right thing to do.
- Don't make a sound.
- There's no need for physical violence.
- Don't make a sound.
- I won't. I'm not a moron.
Would I feel easier if this high-flying China Seas concept...
...were in the hands of someone less impulsive?
Would you like me to clarify the question?
Well, see...
...I don't know how you feel.
I only know that the man you're looking at cares a lot about this job.
He works real hard at it.
He works on weekends, he works at nights.
Sometimes he doesn't even get enough time to see his kid...
...people he cares about.
Now you say if his idea doesn't work, he's gonna get fired?
Well, that sucks!
That's treating him like some kind of yin-yang.
Well, if it's a yin-yang you want for this job...
...you got three much better guys to choose from.
Dad?
Dad!
Now, I don't want you to get upset, and I don't want you to panic.
- The thing is, I've been kidnapped.
- What do you mean, kidnapped?!
- Where are you? Who did it?
- Stop that.
What did I just ask you not to do?
Now, listen carefully and just make a note of everything this person says.
- Now, listen up.
- Have you done this before?
I need the skull.
- Mister...
- Seymour.
- Seymour. It's not here.
- It's not here?
I told you I wished to show it to someone.
Look, you don't know how really intense this is.
Not to worry,
I have his address here.
Somewhere.
Address, address, address...
Come closer, young man.
I need the skull, sir.
I'm totally desperate.
Come. Sit down.
Sorry.
Look, if you're so desperate for money, let me make you an offer.
I have a little set aside:
Savings, bonds, T-bills.
In your piggy bank?
For God's sake, will you stop treating me like a child.
The skull made me a child.
It has magical powers.
I am not me, and my father is not him.
My father is me, and I am my father.
Yes, yes. And we are the world.
Turkey or chicken salad?
Okay.
So how do I know you were in the Oriental Palace in Bangkok?
You took a Polaroid of me and my girlfriend.
You were wearing a cheap linen suit with soy sauce on the lapel.
Hey, get off the line, you pervert!
It's me! I just made it.
All right. Okay. Now...
... here's what you do.
There's been some very weird stuff he's been telling me you should know.
We should talk.
Talk? You wanna talk now?
He says he's a father.
Horny little bastard.
Dad!
- You got it?
- Yeah.
Wait! Where's my dad?
- I got it!
- Are you sure?
Dad! Dad, are you okay?
Did you look? Did you check?
Put me down! They're going to the train station. We gotta go!
Let's go! I saw their tickets.
New York, 3:00, track 12.
- Taxi!
- Forget it. We've only got 12 minutes.
- Officer! This old lady's being mugged!
- Where?
- Up on the platform.
- Thanks, kid.
- We can't!
- Charlie, we have no choice.
- I can't drive it.
- I can.
You better wear it, Dad.
Dad!
Dad!
I'm telling you, the kid says it has magical powers.
I believe it.
It's going to make us rich.
What the hell was that?
Heading west on Harrison in pursuit of a midget on one of our bikes.
The same kind of trains here, okay?
Don't worry about it.
Did you hear what the man said?
- Look, "To all trains." What did I say?
- We're not gonna make it.
Hang on!
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Where you going, Dad? Wrong way!
Turn it, Dad! They're there!
Calhoun, Chicago Vice!
Way to go!
All right!
Dad, you're a totally intense dude.
Thank you, Charlie.
That's the nicest thing you ever said to me.
I couldn't. I feel sick.
- Lf we'd have been caught...
- We werert.
We'd be looking at 25 years.
Life.
Oh, boy. With this, we can afford to go legit.
Just as well, your nerves are shot to shit.
My whole digestive system.
- It's me who's been taking all the risks.
- Excuse me?
- Oh, sorry.
- Excuse me.
Dad, knock.
Think you got a rough deal traveling around the East?
Don't tell me you don't have girls there.
You'd trade all that for a New York winter on 34th Street?
New York? I wish!
Sorry.
I tried to warn you.
Come on, let's go. Let's go!
Run! Go!
It happens to the best of families.
Don't worry about it.
Dad, what are we gonna do?
If we tell them the truth, we end up in straitjackets.
We don't. We take the rap.
I have a great lawyer.
Your defense is "executive burnout."
Please, don't cry. Here.
No.
What about those people?
Those people that kidnapped you?
Think about it.
Oh, yeah.
I guess they got theirs.
Cliff!
Hi, Marshall.
You're lucky I was home when they called the house.
Listen, your mom doesn't know anything about this.
I told her I'd pick you up after school, we went to see a movie.
- Thanks, Cliff.
- Thanks, Cliff.
Yeah, well...
...I don't wanna give her any more grief.
Marshall, come here.
Marshall, I don't know what to say to you.
Pull it together.
I know you don't get a chance to see much of your kid...
...but I think today maybe you overcompensated.
- Yes, Cliff.
- Yes, Cliff.
Anyway, you're free to go on your own recognizance.
I know the captain.
He knocked the counts down to seven.
- Thanks a lot, Cliff.
- Thanks a lot, Cliff.
Yeah. Let's go home.
Oh, you better take that.
Sam!
I got your message, Marshall.
What happened to you?
Where have you been?
I had to do some stuff.
What happened at the meeting after I left?
Well, I'll have to tell you, it was a little tense in there for about 30 seconds.
Finally, Avery says:
"Unless the yin-yangs have objections...
...I think we should let Marshall run with this sucker."
Does that mean I still have a job?
That's great, Sam.
Let's celebrate.
No! There's something you gotta do for me, Sam.
Take me over to Charlie's real quick.
- Why?
- I got a Christmas present for him.
You and Charlie have gotten much closer, haven't you?
We need each other.
Marshall, you do know
I'm going home for Christmas.
Do you want to come?
The apartment's gonna seem pretty lonely.
- Especially with Charlie gone.
- Yeah, it's real lonely.
I've been thinking about that.
I don't think it's right for a man of his...
This age to be on his own.
Great. We can leave a day early.
No, I didn't mean...
I wasrt just talking about the holidays.
I was thinking about all the time.
I mean...
Well, like...
Will you marry me?
Merry Christmas.
Okay, here's what we do.
The lama said when we wish, we both have to be touching it.
- That's why it worked the first time.
- Right.
Get undressed, Dad.
You'll rip my pajamas.
Hit the lights.
Charlie, you okay?
It worked.
- Oh, my God.
- All right, Dad. All right.
What movie did you take him to?
Get some sleep.
What am I gonna do with that thing?
When you get back to Thailand, you can find out who it belongs to.
Avery gave you a "go."
He wants you and Sam back there after New Year's.
Awesome.
I want Mo to know he'll always be welcome at my place.
And we'll be seeing a lot more of you, right?
Yeah.
Boy, it sure feels good to be 11 again.
And you must be glad to be...
How old are you, Dad?
Younger than I used to be, kid.
It's good to see you, Sam.
Did you tell him?
- Tell him what?
- That I said "yes."
Yes to what?
You can't have forgotten.
It was Just 20 minutes ago.
You proposed to me.
And you said "yes."
Sure, I told him.
He's almost as thrilled about it as I am.
NARRATOR: In 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a miIitary court... for a crime they didn't commit.
These men promptIy escaped from a maximum security stockade... to the Los AngeIes underground.
Today, stiII wanted by the government, they survive as soIdiers of fortune.
If you have a probIem, if no one eIse can heIp... and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the A-Team.
[Theme music]
[Peaceful instrumental music]
[Gun firing]
[Neighing fearfully]
[Racy instrumental music]
All right, head them up over there.
This load of glue ain't getting away.
Get them! lt's that crazy lndian!
[Gun firing]
[Racy instrumental music continues]
[Gunfire continues]
-Stay on him.
-That lndian's nuts, Stryker.
He's also gonna be dead.
[Gun firing]
Get closer.
[Horse neighing fearfully]
Chief, you're gonna be real sorry.
STRYKER: Bus?
-Carter.
-This is Stryker. Herd got away.
You radioed before you was chasing them into the valley.
-How'd they get out?
-lt was that lndian again.
-You let him get away again, too?
-No, sir. Not this time.
You send him back to his reservation in a basket, you hear?
These men have been wanted for over 10 years. lt's time that we closed the file.
The case has been back burner for years, General. lt's common knowledge...
Col. Lynch has been waging his own ridiculous little vendetta.
Precisely why Col. Lynch is now out and this matter is hanging fire.
These three soldiers were tried and convicted... because of extreme political pressure at the time.
Which is something that you should understand.
Yes, sir.
They were practically forgotten about... within a couple of years of their escape.
But Lynch keeps throwing balls down their alley... and now he's mushroomed this whole thing... into what's considered to be a highly embarrassing series of situations.
Look at that.
December 3, '77, they relieved Col. Lynch... of one executive jet belonging to the military.
[Military instrumental music]
Who is that?
That? That's nothing.
File it under old business.
[Siren wailing]
[Thrilling instrumental music]
DECKER: Two months Iater, he Iost five MP cars in a high speed pursuit.
[Sirens continue wailing]
Hang on, kid.
[Motorbike engine revving]
We should be meeting B.A. any minute.
FACE: Look out, Hannibal!
For which we had to make restitution... to shopkeepers whose storefronts were destroyed by Lynch's actions.
And then, last year... after the newspaper headlines said they'd captured the Team... they escaped from a full security military installation.
DECKER: Taking with them a miIitary troop pIane under Lynch's command.
[Adventurous instrumental music]
HANNlBAL: Go, Murdock!
You know, all in all... they've made a fine bunch of jackasses out of all of us... and l want it to stop now.
GENERAL: l want you to bring the A-Team in.
GENERAL: You were the best troubleshooter the past two wars.
Until extreme political pressures knocked the hat off my career... and any possibility of furthering my rank. lt seems the very methods that made me an embarrassment... and shuffled me off to the side... are the exact reasons l'm being considered the best man for this job.
GENERAL: l'm not saying--
DECKER: We know what you're saying... so let's don't dance around the floor once.
Everybody heard the reports from 'Nam on these guys. They were the best.
Because they're fast, sharp and unorthodox.
DECKER: The way to catch men like this is to play by their rules.
Which means there are none.
What l'm interested in, Colonel, is results. l don't expect detailed reports on the whats, hows or whens of their apprehension. l just want to know that it's done.
GENERAL: You erase the blot from our records and l'll be very pleased.
GENERAL: Which means that others will be very pleased.
Do what you have to do.
Get me the A-Team.
Yes, sir.
-Morning.
-Yeah, morning.
Are you the only hot dog vendor here in the park?
Do you see any other hot dog vendors?
-No.
-Well, you won't. l got a contract with the city.
Could l have a hot dog, please?
You kidding? You mean a lukewarm dog.
-l just fired her up.
-Well, that's fine, whatever.
There's a coffee shop across the street, got hot food, got good breakfast rolls, too.
No. l'd like a hot dog.
[Muttering] l never heard of anybody... eating hot dogs at 1 1 :00.
DANlEL: What?
HANNlBAL: l said... l never heard of anybody eating hot dogs at 1 1 :00.
Then why do you open up at 1 1 :00?
HANNlBAL: l don't open up, son.
HANNlBAL: l fire up at 1 1 :00.
The dogs are ready by noon.
Then l'm ready for the lunch crowd. l work from noon to 4:00. l've been doing that for about 28 years. l'm a well established firm around here.
Well, that's great.
Then maybe you know Mr. Lee.
HANNlBAL: Who?
DANlEL: Mr. Lee.
DANlEL: He owns the Chinese laundry up over on Sixth Street.
-A Chinaman?
-Yes.
Never heard of him.
He told me to come on down here to buy a hot dog. l wish he'd told me.
'Cause l'd have told him to tell you not to come till noon.
See, l fire up at 1 1 :00, but the dogs aren't ready till noon. l guess you don't know.
Sorry l bothered you.
You forgot your dog.
-That's okay--
-No. l can't take it back. lt's a health law.
And we don't want to throw it away.
There are people out there starving who would just love a cold hot dog.
-l guess you're right.
-That's 75 cents.
-Keep the change.
-Thank you very much.
[Mysterious instrumental music]
Here you go, B.A. No mustard.
Hannibal, how many more of these cold hot dogs l got to eat? l'll save this one.
[Hannibal sighing] l had to have them for props. You don't want me to waste good money, do you?
That dude definitely wasn't being followed.
So if he's a birddog for the military, he ain't got no backup.
Yeah, l haven't seen any MPs.
My conversation with him as Mr. Lee, l'd say he's a good man with a real problem.
We gotta help him. l'll get Amy, you go spring Murdock and get Face. l don't know where Face is.
Been trying to reach him since yesterday. l'm telling you, Boobie, we shoot all three pictures at once.
That way we get the two sequels in the can while we're shooting the first one.
-And if the first one opens big--
-l hear you, Mick.
But, believe me, we're talking major box office business here.
Gretel, babe, you've met the Mick, haven't you? l'm real happy the Jer could fly you over for the premiere.
[Gretel speaking in German] lt's going to be a big night.
Everyone who's anyone is here.
The screening is scheduled to start in 15 minutes, Colonel.
Let's get ready to move.
He'll have too much advantage in a darkened theatre.
Are the men inside ready?
-Yes, sir.
-Let's do it.
FACE: ...first eight or nine weeks,
$30 million. You take that and reinvest it.
You can get four or five more pictures going. l talked to a guy at MGM--
WAlTER: Mr. Johnson, there's a telephone call for you.
For me? Take a message.
WAlTER: You wouldn't want these people to know... that you're really Templeton Peck of the A-Team, would you?
WAlTER: Follow me.
Excuse me. Overseas. Could be that spot in Cannes l was hoping for.
Gretel, babe, keep the Mick company.
FACE: The Jer'll be back in a second.
What a guy.
[Light instrumental music playing]
WAlTER: Here.
Hannibal, what is this? What's going on?
That's my line. l'm meeting a client tonight in case you'd like to know.
B.A. hasn't been able to reach you since yesterday.
He should've left a message at the Beverly Hills office. l didn't know we had one.
And what is this?
FACE: Bad picture. Look at....
They must've caught me leaving La Serre on Thursday.
You'd think they'd hire a professional photographer...
-for a front page picture.
-Did you know you've lost your drive wheel?
-l mean, what do you think you're doing?
-l've decided to produce.
-Miracle Films.
-''lf it's a good film, it's a Miracle.''
-Catchy, huh?
-You're nuts.
Now, who did you scam to spring for this little extravaganza?
FACE: No, that's just it, Hannibal. ln Hollywood, when you get someone else to pay the freight... you're not scamming, you're producing.
FACE: There's tons of guys who don't know what to do with their money... just dying to get into showbiz.
The glamour, the broads, the parties. l've waited 20 years for someone to throw a party like this for me.
-How do you do it?
-See.... l needed a showpiece, so l scrambled around... looking for any piece of junk l could get my hands on.
And l come across this little number for $10,000... made by a couple of film students.
So, l dub it in German then l subtitle it back into English... and tell everyone l brought it from overseas.
The critics see that, and right away... you're looking down the business end of a good review.
Yeah, but Wine For Breakfast?
Yeah, that's just one of the little touches.
You give it a lousy title and tell everyone it doesn't translate well from the original.
FACE: Forget that. l want you to read a script. lt's gonna be my first stateside production.
The Beast of the YeIIow Night.
FACE: And guess who'll play the beast of the title role? l'm telling you, by the time l'm done... they're gonna put your claw prints out front in the cement.
And they're gonna put you behind bars.
FACE: Come on, Hannibal... you don't think Col. Lynch reads the film business trades, do you?
HANNlBAL: Face--
FACE: No, relax.
Why don't you come on up and meet some of the guys? l have to meet a client. l already ran him by Mr. Lee and the hot dog vendor... and l'm gonna snap him up and take the case.
HANNlBAL: l came to tell you to meet B.A. at the hospital and spring Murdock.
Amy's gonna meet us at the warehouse.
FACE: No, not tonight.
HANNlBAL: lt must be tonight.
FACE: l got a few guys l'm gonna turn for a few million. l can't just douse the house lights... and give them a box of popcorn to remember me by.
-What?
-You're not George Lucas.
No, you're not. Now we need the job.
This guy, Daniel Running Bear, needs our help.
Go get Murdock.
And keep your head down. l've got a feeling
Lynch is outside this minute.
Military police! Everybody down!
[All screaming]
Give it up, Peck!
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
-You'll call me?
-Yeah, the first chance l get.
[Women screaming]
Hurry up, get after him!
The one who catches him keeps his rank.
HANNlBAL: Mr. Johnson's looking for you. l've been right here.
Well, you should be back there.
There's a real fender bender in the lot.
[Fast-paced instrumental music continues]
[Sirens wailing]
Somebody ought to tell this guy.
He's got a shimmy at 85.
[Car horns honking]
You want me to get that? l'm fine.
Hang on.
They'll never catch us.
Who in the world is this guy? lt sure isn't Lynch. l don't know.
But it's gonna be fun finding out.
[Upbeat instrumental music]
[Sombre instrumental music]
-l'm sorry. What?
-Nothing.
Wait a minute, you okay?
Fine, yeah. You got a problem?
No, l just thought maybe you were hungry.
Here.... My wallet!
DANlEL: Wait a minute!
COP: You got a problem here? l could have given you a couple of bucks.
No, Officer.
Yeah? Well, let's see some lD.
Yes, sir.
HANNlBAL: Yeah, you both better get in the car. We'll kick this around.
Do we have to do this, Officer?
There's nothing really happening here.
HANNlBAL: Get in the car.
DANlEL: Wait a minute! What about him?
HANNlBAL: Get in.
-What's going on here?
-Now...
Daniel Running Bear... what are you doing in Los Angeles? l came here to meet some people.
The A-Team?
-l'm Hannibal Smith.
-Hannibal Smith?
HANNlBAL: Yeah.
DANlEL: This has all been pretty weird.
Yeah, l know.
But it gets slower from here on. l hope so, because l don't think l could handle another crazy scene.
MURDOCK: And so, the Range Rider defeats the Black Rock gang... in another daring shootout.
NARRATOR: [On TV] Once again making the pIains safe... for aII who dare brave the untamed west.
No matter race nor creed... the Range Rider stands for truth and justice for aII.
[Dramatic country music playing on TV]
MURDOCK: lt's all right, girl.
MURDOCK: l must have been wrong.
MURDOCK: The Black Rock gang has lured us into this cave... and then they've pushed a boulder in front of the opening.
MURDOCK: But there has to be another way out.
How about right here through this window?
MURDOCK: Lucky you showed up with a flashlight.
MURDOCK: There's a blackout at the building.
That's because
B.A. is jumping the master circuit... so the alarm wouldn't go off.
Murdock, what are you wearing?
MURDOCK: l guess my secret's out.
You've discovered my alter ego.
You're not Professor Nutty Butty again, are you?
FACE: Rex the Wonder Dog?
MURDOCK: No. lt's just that when you phoned... you said we were going up against some horse rustlers.
MURDOCK: Who better to defeat them than the mysterious lawman of the plains... the Range Rider.
You got me there. Now come on, Murdock.
FACE: l told B.A. to turn on the juice in about 10 minutes.
FACE: Any longer than that and they'll start a room check.
FACE: Nighty-night, Murdock.
MURDOCK: Thunder, girl.
No, Thunder's not who l think she is?
MURDOCK: Whoa, girl. l don't know, Murdock... you know how B.A. feels about having Billy in his van, and he's just a dog.
MURDOCK: The Range Rider would sooner face a dozen bandits... without his six-shooters... than not have Thunder at his side.
MURDOCK: No man is tall enough to come between me and my trusty steed.
MURDOCK: Come, girl.
Sucker, you better not be talking to no invisible animals.
FACE: Here we go again.
B.A.: Come on.
[Country music resumes playing on TV]
-Thanks.
-Sure.
NARRATOR: [On TV] Once again, the faithfuI rider of the range... is off on another great adventure.
Murdock, in case someone spots us... we don't want them to recognise you and blow the alarm.
MURDOCK: Good idea, Kemosabe.
That's B.A. Baracus's van.
Yeah, it pulled up while you were inside... so l slipped out and attached a homer to it.
CRANE: Good move, Sergeant.
Murdock's still in his room. l guess they still visit him on occasion.
They were part of the same unit.
Any sign of Smith?
Couldn't see, too dark.
But l figured they'd lead us right to the good Colonel.
[Upbeat instrumental music]
-Anybody follow you?
-No, l was real careful.
Col. Decker, l think we've got the A-Team.
[Greeting in Native American language]
MURDOCK: You must be
Chief Running Bear... who has summoned help to save them wild horses... from being slaughtered by rustlers.
DANlEL: This keeps getting better.
First you take me off Hollywood Boulevard dressed as a cop... and now the Range Rider shows up.
You know the Range Rider?
MURDOCK: A full-blooded American lndian living on the open plains of Arizona... where the Range Rider dispenses his justice?
MURDOCK: Naturally, he's heard of me. l used to catch the Saturday morning reruns when l was at UCLA.
-Mr. Running Bear.
-Daniel.
Daniel, there is a federal bureau that watches over wild mustangs.
Yes, but like any other branch of the government... too much to govern, too few people to do it.
There are thousands of wild horses spread over the United States.
And every one of them is protected by law.
Yes. But when someone like Bus Carter breaks the law... it's very hard to press charges.
The largest land-owner.
And his standing with the local Cattlemen's Association... makes him a very influential man in the county.
He also plays dirty.
To be perfectly honest with you... l've had most of my wardrobe made for the year... and l don't have anything to go with one of those.
So l'm afraid l'll have to return this money you gave us.
Face.
Look, l'm sorry l didn't tell Mr. Lee l didn't have enough to cover your fee.
HANNlBAL: No, you're not.
You're right. l had to meet you to convince you how important this really is.
We've had it happen to us before, haven't we, Amy? l don't think it ever hurts to listen to anyone's troubles.
We're always working for chump change.
This time, we're trying to save a bunch of horses.
But these horses have been there for as long as my people can remember.
They're a part of the land, a part of my tribe.
Surely you can appreciate the importance of one's heritage and traditions. l will raise the money eventually.
Look, all l ask is that you come down and take a look.
DANlEL: See for yourselves. lf that doesn't convince you... then l understand. l guess anybody who's crazy enough to take on three jeeploads... of armed rustlers on horseback by himself, deserves special consideration.
We're still working for almost nothing again.
MURDOCK: Once again... the mysterious Range Rider sets out on another thrilling adventure... with his trusty steed, Thunder, who....
Who will remain behind just this one time.
Well, guys, shall we saddle up?
[Gunfire]
DECKER: This is CoI. Decker of the U.S. Army.
You are compIeteIy surrounded.
No kidding?
Col. Decker, did you hear that?
You know this guy?
Everyone in Vietnam knew him.
He always got the job done under any circumstances... and he never lost any sleep over how he did it.
Yeah, Hannibal and this guy mixed it up once in the DOOM Club.
The DOOM Club?
The Da Nang Officers' Open Mess.
You didn't like the way he sugared his coffee?
No. l didn't like the way he blew up
Cong hospitals like a favourite sport.
Give yourseIf up... or I'II fIush the whoIe buiIding and everyone inside right in the sewer.
-ls he kidding?
-Sounds like he's crazy!
-Decker is crazy.
-Maybe l should go out and talk to him.
You want me to start bIasting, Smith?
-Well, Hannibal?
-l'm thinking.
[Gunfire continues]
Think faster, man!
Hey, Decker, this is Smith.
You ought to cool out.
What if we have an innocent person in here?
Who might that be? Amy AIIen?
I'd hardIy caII her innocent.
Okay, look--
No taIk. You come out or we come in.
And you're not gonna Iike it if we come in.
I'm giving you two minutes.
Don't you love it?
No matter how smart they think they are, they always screw up somehow.
HANNlBAL: Let's get the weapons out of the van.
What are we gonna do in two minutes?
You heard the man.
We're going out the front door. lt's obvious they really have no choice.
With anyone but Col. Hannibal Smith.
With him, nothing is obvious.
What can he do?
We'll find out in about 40 seconds.
[Thrilling instrumental music]
Looks like you stopped the A-Team once and for all.
-What about Hannibal?
-He'll be all right.
MP 1 : Get those civilians back!
Keep them out of the way!
All right, show's over. Go back to work.
Come on, move along.
HANNlBAL: Hey, you got a light, pal?
MP 2: Sure.
MP 2: Keep them.
HANNlBAL: Thanks, pal.
[Victorious instrumental music]
FACE: Beautiful Arizona.
Quiet, serene, the comatose state.
You ought to scout locations for your next movie here.
That career sure went fast. Talk about the sizzle and fizzle of Hollywood.
Move over, man. Give me room.
FACE: Will you take it easy?
You're gonna break my rib.
This fool won't gimme no room! l didn't design this thing. Besides, there ain't enough room for four of us.
Four of us. What do you mean?
Three of us, sucker! You got that?
B.A.: You hear me, sucker? There's three of us. No animal, no nothing. Got it?
Say three or he's gonna bounce you down the hyphenated line.
Okay, three!
AMY: Will you guys knock it off?
On my reporter's salary, l can't afford to buy a new car... every time you guys get together in it. lt's a long ride, and this is not the most comfortable car. l'm comfortable.
We wouldn't be going through this, if you didn't leave my van behind!
-You said you was gonna lose those MPs.
-l did.
But you didn't bring my van back. l worked hard on them wheels, Hannibal. l'm sure it'll turn up sooner or later.
[Crane chugging] lt's empty.
We can drag the bay.
Don't waste the energy.
All of the bodies couldn't have washed out.
How did he do it?
DECKER: He's Hannibal Smith.
That's how he does it. lt would have been easy for him to jump clear of the van before it hit the water... and then drift off with the rest of this crowd.
For a while, l thought this was gonna be easy.
Anything on those prints we found at the warehouse, that weren't Smith's?
Yeah. Daniel Running Bear. We had his prints on file from the military.
He served from '66 to '68,
First Air Cav in Vietnam.
Get an address on this Running Bear.
He's a computer programmer in Arizona.
Lives on the Chequea lndian Reservation where he was born.
Let's pay Mr. Running Bear a little visit... find out what his story is. lt's the easiest way up there. lt's more comfortable than crowding into my Land Rover.
Man, horses! Don't you just love horses?
When l can see them.
[Lilting country song] l was out here one night when l first saw Carter's men... rounding up the horses.
Where they corral them l have no idea.
But then again,
Carter has over 250,000 acres.
He can't sit on those mustangs for long.
You say he ships them by rail?
Those railroad tracks that we passed coming out of town? That's his line.
He's got Iocomotives and boxcars which he uses to move out his cattIe. l'm sure he takes the horses down to a slaughter-house in Mexico... which is only a short run from here.
What about your people, brother?
How can they let this happen?
What about them?
They're people just like anybody else.
They make a Iiving, go about their business just Iike any others.
They're not gonna dig out the war paint... and saddle up and go against Carter's hacienda.
Besides, the Chequea were never a warring tribe.
They were fishermen who migrated south during the war of 1864.
No kidding?
-Heck of a way to fish.
-Let me see that.
Be my guest. Any more come this way, you can have them, too.
Chequea.
-The Chequea were a--
-What?
A warring tribe.
[Screaming]
DANlEL: Wait! Don't hurt him.
B.A.: lt's a kid.
Shelly, it's me!
SHELLY: Daniel, l thought you were still in Los Angeles. l just came back.
This is my nephew, Shelly.
How do you do? l believe this belongs to you.
What's wrong with you, kid?
Firing these arrows at people.
Don't you know they're dangerous?
They could hurt somebody real bad.
Couldn't you find better toys to play with?
Not exactly great for 100%% worsted cotton either, kid. l don't hit anything unless l want to. l happen to be county champion. l was just trying to scare you off.
SHELLY: Thought you were
Bus Carter's men.
-They came out here with me to help.
-Yeah?
SHELLY: You're gonna help us trash Carter and his men?
Trash Carter?
Shelly and Daniel Running Bear.
Wonder what Sitting Bull would think. l don't know how the rest of you feel... but l wouldn't sleep well tonight... knowing those animals there are gonna wind up as the sticky side of a stamp.
He does it every time.
Does that mean you'll help?
You'll stop Carter?
-We're gonna try.
-That means we will.
Whenever Hannibal says that, means he's got a plan.
[Heroic instrumental music] l'm gonna go out to the reservation with Daniel.
You know, just dig up some background, talk to some of the elders.
AMY: Maybe there's a human interest story in all this.
Yeah, it looks like there sure could be.
We'll check into a motel.
There's a couple of more things l wanna get our hands on.
-We'll leave word where we are at the store.
-Okay. lt's right over here, Miss Carter.
We shouldn't be taking too much longer getting these things loaded. l sure hope you don't mind. l know it was a long flight, but this was on the way back from the airport.
LANE: No problem.
Your uncle is real anxious to see you.
DANlEL: Would you move, please?
STRYKER: ''Please.''
Looks like you did learn something about how to act in front of people.
That's good, because the next time--
There's not gonna be no next time.
You've got that straight.
You're not stealing any more of those horses.
STRYKER: Kid's got a crazy mouth on him, chief.
Maybe somebody ought to teach him to respect his elders.
Don't you think you've done enough already?
This looks like a job for the Range Rider. l'm gonna shut this fool up for good. l think Murdock's right.
Really?
-Yeah.
-Let's go.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
FACE: They'll never recognise us.
[Dramatic instrumental music intensifies]
HANNlBAL: You look like a bunch of girls waiting for a date at a square dance.
And just who the heck are you? l'm the mysterious rider of the plains, the Range Rider... and these are my trusty companions.
Boys, looks like we found ourselves some goofballs.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
You tell Mr. Carter he's out of the rustling business.
HANNlBAL: No more mustangs leave that valley. lt should be gold, but....
Well, l think you understand.
This looks like it's gonna get real interesting real soon.
Yep, it usually does.
CARTER: Use your knees more, honey.
CARTER: Let up on the reins, give the little neck more lead.
We're gonna move the horses over to the corral at sundown so we can load them.
How many we got?
We got enough for two boxes but we only got one empty car on the train.
Unless you just wanna not make that delivery to McGivers.
No, l done already told him he'd get his beef.
Just load up the one boxcar.
We'll ship the rest out this weekend.
What you gonna do about these guys we told you about, Bus?
Who? That bunch of masked yahoos riding around... like a High Plains Drifter or somebody?
The Range Rider, Bus.
Cloud of dust, fiery horse....
They said we shouldn't be shipping no more horses to the dog food company.
That so?
Thanks.
Uncle Bus, l'm through. l kept Sentinel ready all year long waiting for you to visit.
You only been riding about an hour. l think l'm a little saddle sore.
Somehow, riding the horse trails in San Francisco just isn't quite the same.
Honey, l keep telling you, you gotta grip with your knees.
Keeps you from bouncing around and hurting your....
...self. l think l'll wash up for lunch now.
My niece is a good girl.
Young, idealistic.
But l'm afraid she might not understand that them horses could wipe out in a week... what would be a month's good grazing for my cattle. lt bothers me a lot that she even might have the slightest inkling of what we're doing. l'm sorry, Bus, but that lndian kid just shot his mouth off... before l could do anything.
She thinks you're rounding up them stray mustangs... over to the reservation behind my back. l told her l'd look into it. l don't want no more dirt tracked around here. You understand?
Yes, sir. And don't worry, we'll find out who these crackerboxes are. l got a couple men over at Lodi... looking through the local places where they might be staying. lf they're still around. l got a feeling they are. l figure it's that lndian.
And he's rounded himself up some help.
Only help l'm worried about him getting is legal help.
On the other hand, if he's just hired himself a couple of gunslingers... we know how to handle that, don't we?
[Horn blowing]
No.
No, l don't hear nothing.
MURDOCK: Are you sure?
[Horse whinnying] l don't hear nothing but if you're positive that-- l'm warning you, l've had enough of you talking to your invisible friend.
Does he look invisible? You can't see him? lnvisible or not, l don't want you talking to nobody. Got that?
Well, l'm sorry, but l'm not the one with the bad attitude.
When someone talks to me l feel obliged to respond in kind. lt's a horse! And horses don't talk!
[Singing] A horse is a horse, of course, of course and no one can taIk to a horse, of course unIess, of course the horse is the famous Mr. Ed
Murdock, any sign?
[Murdock choking on radio]
B.A., take your hand off Murdock's throat.
Yeah.
Ed says....
Ain't no train coming.
-Who's Ed?
-Guess?
[Horse whinnying]
Train coming, muchachos.
And l ain't telling you who told us.
[Whinnying]
FACE: Got that, Amy?
AMY: Great.
Face, this stuff really stinks.
What is in this grease anyway?
FACE: lt's not grease.
AMY: What is it?
Face?
You know, this worked great in a movie l did.
The Giant GiIa Monster
Versus BiIIy the Kid, right?
-You remember that one.
-Who could forget it?
[Train horn blowing]
[Adventurous instrumental music] l think you know what to do.
HANNlBAL: Go on, you devils!
MURDOCK: Once again, the mysterious Rider of the Range... deals another triumphant blow for the rights of the oppressed.
-Don't ask.
-l wasn't going to.
MURDOCK.: [Singing]
I'm just a Ionesome cowboy
I'm just a Ionesome cowboy
And I got no summer home
Whoever heard of bandits on horseback in the 1980s?
According to Wesley, they came riding down on the train... like they was the James gang or something. l want you and the boys to get out there and round up them mustangs... before they get to the grassland and wipe out my herd.
First thing tomorrow morning, l want you to you ship them... and every other horse we got out of here.
And find them yahoos.
Well, Bus, we've checked every hotel there is in Lodi... and l got a man watching the reservation.
But lf they're just camping out someplace... we're talking about hundreds of thousands of acres.
Then use the chopper.
Do whatever you gotta do, but find them.
Morning, Miss Lane. l wouldn't have thought you'd be up this early.
-l heard you talking.
-Just some business problems.
[Hannibal whistles]
HANNlBAL: l don't mind if l do.
Who the devil are you?
What are you doing here?
You'll find out.
This is a stupid move.
You yahoos are crazy to come back here. l agree. l told you it was crazy.
He never listens.
We're here to file a grievance against the Carter Railway Line... for the Wild Horses of America,
Western Divisions.
Not to be confused with the Horses' Butts of America... of which we hear you are a member of long standing.
And we would deeply appreciate it... if you would stop harassing our dues-paying loyal membership... which includes all the wild mustangs that run in this free land.
Both of you are dead.
No, wait, you don't seem to get the point here.
We're the ones making the threats and you better believe us.
We hear so much as a neigh from one of those mustangs out there... we'll be back to hogtie and brand you for good.
Now you get all of your papers out of your safe... that have to do with the slaughter-house you do business with in Mexico.
Now.
Bingo. Puppy Love Dog Food Company in Ensenada.
-Great shot.
-Yeah.
Get out of here!
Hold your fire! Don't shoot! lt's awfully kind of Miss Carter to escort us out.
HANNlBAL: Tell them.
All right, l want all you high school dropouts... to count to 1 25 before you even twitch.
Get them.
[Tense instrumental music]
Move it!
[Peaceful instrumental music]
What do you say, Murdock?
Anyone sniffing around?
Daniel and Shelly dropped by with some grub. They're still here.
Otherwise, it's been real quiet.
FACE: Yeah, l'll bet it is, especially without
Thunder to keep you company.
And B.A. said something awful to Ed, and now he ain't talking to nobody.
MURDOCK: Colonel, what about this bush business? l'm done with it, you hear me?
Not exactly coming naturally, is it? lt's like anything else, Amy. lt takes some practise and a little technique.
A lot like driving a golf ball or shooting skeet.
Come on.
Okay, bring it up.
Straighten this arm and crook your elbow.
Very nice.
AMY: Boy, the well is never dry with you, is it, Face? lf l had pulled that ''let me show you how to aim that thing'' routine... you'd never let me hear the end of it. l caught the act as l rode up.
So, how's the arm, Danny?
FeeIing better, is it? l'd like to introduce our guest.
This is Miss Carter.
-Bus Carter's niece?
-That's right.
Just how long do you think you can get away with this?
-With what?
-Holding me against my will.
We're not holding you against your will.
We just borrowed you.
HANNlBAL: You're free to go anytime.
LANE: You kidnapped me.
That was just to keep from being dropped in a deep hole... on Bus Carter's north 40.
We're not the criminals around here.
We will let the law decide that. l don't think your Uncle would want to bring the law in on this.
They might investigate too deeply and find out... that he's been rounding up wild mustangs and selling them illegally.
LANE: My uncle?
B.A.: That's right, your uncle.
They round up the horses, then ship them by train... to a dog food company in Mexico. lt'd make real interesting reading for Amy's subscribers. l see you got yourself some new arrows there.
Kid, listen, l just brought one jacket, so.... l tried to convince myself it was Stryker. l even went to Uncle Bus. l guess l believed he was involved all along.
You just walk up that way north, you should come across your uncle's men by dawn.
We'd give you a horse to ride, but then one of us would be on foot.
So, happy trails.
Aren't you afraid l'll tell him where your camp is, or what you look like?
By that time, we'll have struck camp and be long gone.
HANNlBAL: As for what we look like... l don't plan on sticking around long enough to get picked out of a line-up.
Wait. l think l heard my uncle saying... that there's still more horses to be shipped out... and that Stryker should get that done first thing.
Adiós.
MURDOCK: [Singing]
I'm an oId cowhand From the Rio Grande
And I Iearned to ride before I Iearned to stand
B.A.: lf you don't shut up, l'll knock you off that horse!
Yippy-l-O-Ki-Ay.
Murdock, why don't you take rearguard... in case one of Carter's men picks up our trail?
Carter knows we have all the proof we need to shut him down right here.
Has to figure we're gonna head for the hills.
We are heading for the hills, aren't we, Hannibal? l don't know. lt's gonna take a couple of days for Amy to file that story... and get an investigation started.
Carter's niece did say there's another shipment of mustangs...
-going out tomorrow morning.
-Hannibal, come on.
Hitting this guy's train twice in a row.
That's kind of pushing it, isn't it?
A lot. That's why we gotta get some stuff together... to keep him from pushing back too hard.
Carter's no idiot. He has to figure that us making another run on his train so soon... it's insane. He'll never be ready for us.
No, l don't think he'll ever be ready for us.
You think he'll be ready for us?
-Yeah, l do.
-So do l.
Better sharpen your pencil and your spurs, Face.
You know, we're only one step ahead of Decker, too.
-Don't worry, l've considered that.
-Of course you have.
[Laughing] l think he's going to be big problems.
Colonel, they're here.
DECKER: They sure are.
DECKER: Apparently they mixed it up with a couple of locals right here yesterday.
No one seems to know what it's about, but knowing Hannibal Smith and his men... they've probably took on some bleeding-heart cause or other.
No doubt requested by Daniel Running Bear.
The shop-keeper said they picked up some camping gear and other supplies... so they're out there somewhere. lt could take forever to find three people camping on the open range.
We'll track them down through Daniel Running Bear.
Let's go see the sheriff... and find out exactly where we can find Running Bear.
Once we've found him, l'm sure the A-Team won't be far away.
Come on, Amy, l could use the help. l'm sure you could, but l'm through being suckered by you. lt's just a straight little scam. lt'll go down easy, and it'll get us everything Hannibal wants.
Come on. Pretty please? Pretty?
See, the brother-sister act will work great for this.
Face, what was in the grease?
-l told you.
-No, you didn't tell me. l can still smell it.
Well, it had a little of this....
And a little of that. l know, you told me that.
But that's not enough, Face.
-Come on, Amy. What do you say?
-Sorry, Face. lf l told you what was in that stuff, l'm sure you wouldn't help.
What?
Never mind. l'll do it on my own.
Go and check with the office. l'll meet you back here in a bit.
Colonel, it's Peck!
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
[Car horn honking]
[Dog growling]
Can l try one of these on? Thanks.
Where did he go?
DECKER: Sorry, ma'am.
That's the second time he's done that to me.
Thanks. l really appreciate your trusting me like that.
Let's just say l liked your face.
Do l have an honest face?
No. But l like it.
[Amusing instrumental music]
Get on the horn, Crane, and get me the 10 best men available.
CRANE: Best men, sir?
DECKER: l'm talking about the best marksmen that can be rounded up... and flown in here before the day is out.
Yes, sir. At least we got them located.
We know they're still here.
They're still here.
And this is gonna be the A-Team's Waterloo.
[lntense instrumental music]
You gotta be kidding.
Carter's gonna be ready for us.
We need a real hole card.
Considering Decker's presence puts a damper... on most possible sources of supplies, l think l did rather well.
Look at it as a challenge, B.A.
Face, l wanted an all-terrain vehicle.
FACE: The important thing to remember is we need something... that can cover the same ground as a train.
The only thing this thing gonna cover is the corner of a junkyard.
Mr. Ed could teach you how to fix it, B.A.
Only he's not gonna.
Well, B.A., what do you think?
Oh, Hannibal.
HANNlBAL: How did l know you were gonna say that?
[Adventurous instrumental music]
[Adventurous instrumental music continues] lt was right around here somewhere, wasn't it, Wesley?
Just up past that bend.
You don't think they'd hit us twice, do you? l mean, two days in a row?
Yeah? What's that?
Here they come. Right on schedule.
Don't look like they're slowing down, man.
They'll slow down. They have to.
You keep a full head of steam.
-Are you crazy?
-l said just keep going.
Son of a gun. They're not slowing down.
[Wheels screeching]
All right, back this thing up, hurry!
All right, turn those mustangs loose or start singing Empty SaddIes.
HANNlBAL: B.A., bring her back!
HANNlBAL: Forward, B.A.!
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
All right, last chance. Drop your guns.
Don't be shy. Come on!
Go, B.A.
[Face exclaiming warningly]
No sneaking up from behind. Drop it.
HANNlBAL: All right, open them up.
You heard the man. Open it up.
[Horses neighing]
Let's go, B.A. Come on, Face!
Let's get out of here!
[Fast-paced instrumental music continues]
Thanks for waiting.
You better step on it.
-l'm going as fast as l can!
-Right. l love it when a plan comes together.
We're gonna have to replace these pieces of rail, it's the only way.
You guys sure do know how to make a nuisance of yourselves, don't you?
We do our best.
All right, let's get to work.
Grab a length of that track... and move it over here so we can back this train off the spur.
-That's gonna take some time.
-Let's get moving, then!
Last thing we need is this train full of horses just sitting.
Mr. Carter wants them out of here.
Let's do it!
We'd offer to help, but....
Skipper, you take a ride with me. l'm sure Mr. Carter wants to have a few words with you.
That's fine. l got a few words for him.
Throw these other two in the caboose.
We'll take care of them on down the line.
-Hang in there.
-Yeah, right.
Don't hold your breath.
There ain't no cavalry in this picture.
You keep thinking that.
[Military instrumental music] l'm gonna stick with Hannibal.
You guys go get some help.
[Heroic instrumental music]
Where did he learn how to do that?
Just like the real Range Rider.
CARTER: lf it ain't old Buffalo Bill himself. lt wouldn't do me any good to call you names...
'cause l can't imagine any name you haven't been called before.
You're a lucky man you didn't harm my niece.
Because of that, l'm not gonna make you die slow.
How long will it be before that train's ready to roll? l told them to just keep on humping.
Absolutely. l mean the last thing you need is to get caught... with a boxcar full of stolen mustangs attached to your own train.
You tell Jesse to fire up the bird. l'm gonna shoot out there with you, see those guys don't mess up.
CARTER: No telling who else these yahoos called in. l want that train over the border into Mexico.
What about him?
Fertilise the south 40 with him.
Have a nice day. l need a distraction. l want you to count to three.
No. Count to five real slow... and then scream for all you're worth.
LANE: [Screaming] Fire!
Help, the stable's on fire!
[Triumphant instrumental music]
[Horse neighing]
Lane, give me my knife and my gun.
Were they really going to kill you? l think that was the general idea.
-What about the others?
-Right where we left them. l figured they weren't going anywhere.
Besides, l had to come for you.
Good idea. Let's go.
Take care of Whacko for me.
HANNlBAL: That's Waco, Murdock.
MURDOCK: Waco.
CARTER: After you get those horses to Mexico, go find that lndian.
Make sure he don't hire any more heIp.
The sheriff? l thought those guys were wanted. l think we should try to swing by the reservation.
Maybe we can pick up a bunch of the guys who'll help.
And if not, then we'd be wasting time. l wanna head straight for the sheriff's.
AMY: My worry is keeping those guys from being killed.
Hannibal can always find a way to escape.
That sounds like the way
Hannibal would think.
Holy....
DECKER: How lucky for me, running into you like this. l don't understand.
DECKER: You are Daniel Running Bear, aren't you?
Why do you ask?
Your license plate.
And l have a description of this vehicle. l'm Col. Decker of the U.S. Army.
I've been trying to reach you at home aII day.
DECKER: l finally decided to drive up to speak with you.
Good thing, too, or we might have missed each other again. l have a lot of important things to take care of--
So do l. l want to know where the A-Team is.
-The A-Team?
-Yes. l'm sure you can tell me. lf not, l feel certain Miss Allen can.
And l'm prepared to stand here all week.
CARTER: l hope you yahoos enjoy your little trip, courtesy Carter Railways.
Unfortunately, though, there ain't no return tickets. l've always wanted to see the country by rail.
[Train horn blowing]
Get rid of them guys. We don't want any outlaw witnesses on board.
STRYKER: All right, the rest of you head on back. Let's get some work done.
STRYKER: We've still got some steers need branding.
And when you get across the border, adiós, yahoos.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Suspenseful instrumental music intensifies]
Go!
[Horn blowing]
Will you hold still? You're gonna rub me raw with these little ropes. l ain't moving, it's the train moving.
Boy, that's great. That's just what we need, an Abbott and Costello routine.
DRlVER: Where are you going?
STRYKER: You don't stop, no matter what.
You got that?
[Gripping instrumental music]
Boy, you must be getting real weak.
You can't break these puny little ropes.
[B.A. grunting] l was just kidding.
B.A., grab that brake wheel.
We gotta stop this train.
[Wheels screeching]
Coming to the border. lf those mustangs get into Mexico, we got no evidence.
Good job, B.A.
There's Murdock.
-B.A.?
-Nighty-night.
HANNlBAL: Face, take my hat for a minute.
FACE: Sure.
B.A., give me your hand.
[B.A. grunts]
Hannibal, we got a bogey at 1 1 :00.
MURDOCK: Come on.
Adiós, bonanza.
Hannibal, come on, let's go!
HANNlBAL: He's not close enough!
FACE: What? Are you crazy?
HANNlBAL: l wouldn't sleep at all tonight if he didn't see the expression on my face.
MURDOCK: Time's a-wasting, partner.
So long, pal.
[Adventurous instrumental music]
-Told you he'd do it.
-That's right. l think there's something real interesting you'd like to know about that train. lt's used to move out wild mustangs off the reservation illegally.
And l think this gentleman has a lot to answer for. l do believe that's a federal offence, isn't it, Colonel?
Yes, ma'am, it is.
Next time, Hannibal Smith. Next time.
[Triumphant instrumental music]
[Cheerful instrumental music]
Look at them. lt's like they know they aren't being hunted anymore.
How great to be free.
We gotta get going before Decker finds out we never left the county.
You know, even though he doesn't have anything positive on me... you can bet he'll probably have me under constant surveillance when l get home.
So l thought maybe l'd stay here a while.
-Gather a little background material?
-Something like that.
Then if Amy'll loan us her car, l guess we can give you a ride to Phoenix Airport.
Great.
Here, B.A.
That's so you can show them to the kids in your class.
Help them understand better... so they can make one.
Thanks, little brother. l'm sure the kids at my daycare centre will love the gift.
-Okay.
-So long.
Daniel, will you say goodbye to Ed for me?
And will you tell him that if he ever needs me... if he ever feels the need to talk to anyone... that l'll always lend an ear?
Good. 'Cause you ain't got no brains.
Sure, Murdock.
[Valiant instrumental music]
They really did it.
They always do.
Here, buckaroo.
Hey, he forgot his mask.
No, he didn't forget his mask.
He just left it behind because his job here is done.
[Peaceful country song]
[Theme music]
Friends, let me introduce myself.
Peltzer's the name.
Rand Peltzer.
That's me there on the corner.
I'm an inventor.
And I have a story to tell.
I know.
Who hasn't got a story?
Well, nobody's got a story like this one.
Nobody.
It all started here in Chinatown.
I was trying to move a little merchandise...
...maybe find a present for my kid.
I tried this one place.
Wait a minute.
What's down here?
This is it.
This is your grandfather's store?
Come on.
No wonder you gotta drag people in off the street.
Go ahead, mister.
Look around.
See if there's something you like.
Are these things real?
I told you, everything's real.
You do have interesting artifacts here...
...but there's one thing you don't have.
And what's that?
Let me show you.
I'm an inventor. I made this.
The Bathroom Buddy.
The invention of the century.
It eliminates the need to carry heavy luggage when you travel.
You got yourself your shaving mirror...
...your toothbrush, a toothpick.
You got toenail clippers...
...a nail file...
...and you got yourself a dental mirror.
This is gonna revolutionize traveling.
Let's just say, for the sake of argument...
...that you're on a bus, a plane or a train.
You forgot to brush your teeth.
You got yourself a bad case of dragon breath.
Bad breath.
What do you do?
No problem, friend.
All you do is...
...you take your toothbrush out...
...and you push this button.
That's absolutely no problem.
Cleans up easily.
What I'd like to do, sir, is give you my card.
Rand Peltzer. "Fantastic Ideas for a Fantastic World. "
I make the illogical logical.
I can get you these.
I can get them by the dozen if you'd like.
What do you think?
Where's that coming from?
What is that?
Mogwai.
What's he doing?
Singing.
He does that sometimes.
I gotta have him.
He's incredible.
Tell you what I'll do.
- I'll give you $100 for him.
No.
I've gotta have him. It's a present for my son for Christmas.
It's what I've been looking for.
I've been everywhere.
I'll give you $200.
That's $200!
I'm sorry.
Mogwai not for sale.
You said everything here was for sale.
Grandfather!
With mogwai comes much responsibility.
I cannot sell him at any price.
Wait outside. I'll be right out.
Just go.
Okay, mister, here it is.
What about your grandfather?
Forget what he said. He's crazy.
We need the money.
Do you want it or not?
I want it.
There's three rules you've gotta follow.
What kind of rules?
Keep him out of the light.
He hates bright light, especially sunlight.
It'll kill him.
And keep him away from water.
Don't get him wet.
But the most important rule, the rule you can never forget...
...no matter how much he cries or how much he begs...
...never, never feed him after midnight. Got it?
Sure. Whatever you say.
Thanks.
And have a merry Christmas.
You're rolling with
Rockin' Ricky Rialto...
...the voice of Kingston Falls, U.S.A.!
Alex...
Getting close to Christmas.
You'll get stuck with a lot of trees again.
I thought I'd see you about now.
Ow!
What the hell is this?
What are you doing in there?
Don't ask.
Alex, I came to get my tree.
Pete, take that tree to Mr. Anderson's truck.
What do you say, Alex?
You can spare one for the sheriff's station.
I paid for mine, Frank.
Billy, you need a jump?
No, thanks, Mr. Futterman.
I'm late for work as it is.
These goddamn foreign cars always freeze up on you.
You don't find American machinery doing that.
See that plow?
Hasn't given me a day's trouble in 15 years.
You know why?
Kentucky Harvester.
It ain't some foreign piece of crap.
That's a Kentucky Harvester.
If I wanna keep my job,
I should be going now.
How's your comic strip coming?
I expect to see you in the funnies with "Smilin' Jack," "Li'I Abner. "
They don't run those comics anymore.
They don't?
Come on, Barn.
Say hello to your wife, okay?
So long, Billy.
Goddamn foreign cars.
Hey, doctor.
Morning, Billy.
Morning, Tom.
Hey, Billy. Barney.
Get in there and be quiet.
- You just made it.
- Again.
Will you sign this petition?
Sure. What's it for?
To declare Dorry's pub a landmark.
Mrs. Deagle's trying to take his lease away.
His too?
Yeah, she says it's a dive, a public nuisance.
That's where my dad proposed to my mom.
That's where everybody's dad proposed to their mom. Cross your "T."
Thanks.
Good morning, Mrs. Deagle.
What's good about it?
Klutz!
Watch it, watch it!
Two hundred. Thank you.
- Mrs. Deagle?
- What?
I just wanted you to know that Joe got another job.
My husband, Joe Harris.
And I've taken up some sewing.
What are you trying to tell me?
Neither of us will be paid for two weeks.
Couldn't you get Mr. Corben...
...to give us a little more time?
Mrs. Harris...
...the bank and I have the same purpose in life...
...to make money.
Not to support a lot of...
...deadbeats.
Mrs. Deagle, it's Christmas!
Now you know what to ask Santa for, don't you?
Mommy, I'm hungry.
Yes, honey. So am I.
This is what's left of my imported Bavarian snowman.
Your dog broke it this morning!
I'm terribly sorry.
Tell me how much I owe you...
I don't want money.
I want your dog.
Barney?
Give him to me.
I'll take him to the kennel.
They'll put him to sleep.
It'll be quick and painless, compared to what I could do to him.
What could you do?
I'll catch the beast myself.
Then he'll get what he deserves.
A slow, painful death.
Maybe I'll put him in my spin dryer on high heat.
That'd do it.
Barney!
Barney, will you get off of her?
My dear lady, are you all right?
I have a very weak heart.
I can't stand a shock like that!
What is that dog doing in here?
This is a bank, not a pet store.
Very good, Gerald.
He wouldn't hurt you.
Excuses, excuses.
You're just like your father.
I've listened to his excuses for 10 years, the loser!
As for you, you mangy cur...
...I'll get you...
...when you least expect it!
Oh, my heart!
I must apologize for this most unusual...
You putz.
The old bat never looked better.
It's great. You're doing fine.
Thanks.
Hello, Gerald.
If it isn't Captain Clip-on.
Guess who almost applied for unemployment today?
- I give up.
- You.
But Mr. Corben had second thoughts.
He gets so sentimental about the holidays.
Imagine that.
I would've fired you in a second.
Merry Christmas to you too.
Excuse me, Mr. Jones.
Hey, Peltzer.
Look, I'm a junior vice president at 23.
By the time I'm 25,
I'm gonna have Mr. Corben's job.
By the time I'm 30,
I'll be a millionaire.
Look at you.
You're practically supporting your whole family.
The world's changing.
You gotta change with it.
You gotta be tough.
Tough? And no one's tougher than you, Ger?
Don't call me that.
My name's Gerald.
Can I get you a drink?
Give me a vodka martini.
Shake, don't stir.
You work here?
Weeknights so Dorry doesn't have to pay an extra waitress.
That's great.
Yeah, that's swell, if you like working for nothing.
Two more rounds for the pool table, on the house.
You haven't seen my new apartment.
I haven't seen your old apartment.
We're talking cable.
Can we have dinner tomorrow night?
I'm working.
Why don't you tell Dorry you're sick? He can't dock your pay.
Billy, is that you?
Yeah, Mom, it's me.
I'm in the kitchen.
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas, movie house!
Merry Christmas, emporium!
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetie.
Do you need any help?
Yeah, you could do the eggs.
Thanks.
Dad's machines work so well the first couple of weeks, then...
Use the sink.
Is something wrong?
No, it's a sad movie.
How was your day?
It was fine.
Come on, what is it?
What's wrong?
Mrs. Deagle called again this afternoon.
Let's not talk about it now.
Don't say anything to Dad.
Fine with me.
Hi, sweetheart!
- Welcome home.
- Hey, Dad.
I'm glad you're back.
How was the trip?
It was great.
The Miracle Company, who has the Kitchen Companion...
...might be interested in the Bathroom Buddy.
Great!
- Thanks!
- You'll like this.
What is it? A birdcage?
No, don't shake it. Open it now.
It won't wait till Christmas.
It's a puppy, isn't it?
Yeah, I can tell.
It's a new car.
- Honey, would you dim the lights?
- Sure.
Dim the lights?
Does it glow in the dark?
It's important. Trust me.
Go ahead, open it.
What is it?
It's your new pet.
Come on, Barney.
Be a good dog.
You're kidding.
Dad, it's really neat.
Where'd you get this?
Some little junk store in Chinatown.
- Can I pick him up?
- Sure, go ahead. Just be careful.
- You gotta be gentle.
- I will.
I hope he's housebroken.
Isn't he cute?
Has it got a name?
Mogwai.
- What?
Mogwai.
Some Chinese word.
I just call him...
...Gizmo.
He seems to like it.
Look up here a minute.
We're getting our picture taken.
Smile.
Ready?
One, two, three...
No, no.
Bright light!
What happened?
He hates bright lights.
There's some important things
I forgot to tell you.
Number one, he hates bright lights.
You gotta keep him out of the sunlight.
Sunlight will kill him.
Number two, keep him away from water.
Don't give him any water to drink.
Whatever you do, don't give him a bath.
And the most important thing...
...don't ever feed him after midnight.
Shh!
Looks like you hurt yourself.
Light bright! Light bright!
Just sit down there and don't fall off, okay?
I'll get you fixed up in no time.
All right.
Hold still.
Sorry. Sorry.
Try not to move so much, okay?
Good night, Giz.
I'll see you in the morning.
Hello!
Mrs. Peltzer?
I got a tree!
Oh, Christ!
Billy!
I just brought in your Christmas tree.
What happened?
Slight problem with the Peltzer Peeler-Juicer.
I thought your dad fixed it.
I thought so too.
You should just buy orange juice in cartons. It's a lot easier.
See, it works.
I had to come.
So I see.
Now I can see. It takes...
...a certain kind of guy.
And that guy needs a certain kind of dame.
It's no problem, Pete.
Leave it up here.
What'll you tell him?
I'll just tell him a bunch of bikers stole it from me on my way home.
Wow! The Hooded Menace.
Issue number one!
Pretty neat, huh?
Where'd you get it?
Dr. Fantasy's, I think.
- What's that?
- Come here. I'll show you.
This is my new pet.
My dad gave him to me.
Neat! What's his name?
His name's Gizmo. Hi, Giz.
He's a mogwai.
Cute!
Blink your eyes.
Go like that.
Can you do that?
Watch. Maybe he'll sing.
Come on, Giz.
Let's go over to the table.
I'll be careful.
There we go.
Gee, Billy, where can I get one of those?
I don't know.
This is the only one I've ever seen.
Can I hold him?
Sure. I don't see why not.
He seems to like you.
Great! Thanks a lot.
Sorry.
What was in that jar?
Nothing! Just water!
Why is he making that noise?
What is it?
I don't know.
Is it alive?
I don't know.
One, two, three, four, five new ones.
Now can I have one?
I don't know.
Look, that one's got a cute stripe on its head.
Isn't that incredible, Pete?
Yeah, great.
Don't you think this...?
This is incredible!
Oh, it is neat.
I'm serious. It's neat.
Gizmo, what's the matter?
- No, no, no.
- Hey, Dad?
- There's something I should tell you.
- Look.
You're familiar with the Bathroom Buddy?
I have made an improvement.
Watch this.
Now, let's say you're late for the big meeting.
It's really important.
You're on your way. You reach up.
You forgot to shave.
What're you gonna do?
Under normal circumstances...
...you are in trouble.
But not if you have the Bathroom Buddy.
Watch this.
What do you think?
That's pretty neat.
What's this button?
- Sorry, Dad.
- It's okay.
I'm sorry.
It's not your fault. I'm working on that. I haven't finished that.
I came up here because there's a problem with the mogwai.
Yeah, what's that?
It multiplies with water.
What?
Do you see what I mean?
I don't believe that.
All that from water?
They got wet?
Plain water.
It's funny.
The new ones aren't like Gizmo.
The striped one seems to be the leader.
You know what?
I'll bet every kid in America would like one of these.
They might replace the dog as the family pet.
Think about it.
The Peltzer Pet.
This could really be the big one.
Barn?
Barney?
Barney, who did this to you?
Hold on, I'll get you down.
Stay still.
Poor dog. Another minute and he would've been a dog-sicle.
All I know is that I'm positive that I closed and locked the door.
How else did she get to him?
We can't point any fingers, not even at Mrs. Deagle.
She's been threatening him.
She'd love to get her hands on him.
We don't have proof. We can't even find footprints leading up to the house.
I'm gonna take Barney to your grandmother's.
Take him there on the way to the convention, pick him up on the way home.
He'll be here for Christmas.
It'll be all right.
I don't think we can drink this.
Why not?
What's wrong with this?
Hey, Billy.
Is that a mogwai?
Yeah, I'm gonna have
Mr. Hanson check it out.
And all of a sudden, there were five new ones like this one.
Now watch this.
Can I keep one of these here, run some tests on him?
I think I can spare one.
This is some Christmas,
Katie, I'll tell you.
First the old bat closes the factory, and now it's my goddamn plow.
Mr. Futterman, guess what?
It's time to go home now.
- How about one more beer?
- No, it's late.
One more beer,
I'll help you clean up.
No, thanks, though.
It'll be okay.
- It'll be okay.
- It will not be okay.
I brought my plow in for a tune-up and found it loaded with foreign parts.
I mean, everything.
Gaskets, pistons, spark plugs.
All of it's foreign.
Billy!
Hi.
Going home?
Oh, yeah.
Gremlins!
You gotta watch out for foreigners.
They plant gremlins in their machinery.
The same gremlins brought down our planes in the big one.
That's right.
World War II.
Good old...
...W- W-I-I.
They're still shipping them over here.
They put them in the cars, the TV.
They put them in the radios you stick in your ears.
They put them in the watches.
Little teeny gremlins.
It's not a good idea that you drive.
Why don't you walk home?
You know, Katie, I think maybe I'll walk home.
- Good.
- It's a nice night.
- Good night, kids.
- Good night.
Gremlins.
That was really good, the way you handled Mr. Futterman.
I'm used to it.
He's been like that ever since he lost his job.
He's like a lot of people around here.
He just wants somebody to listen.
Especially around the holidays.
Why is that?
It's when a lot of people get really depressed.
I always thought everyone was happy during the holidays, no matter what.
Most people are, but some aren't.
While everybody else opens up presents, they're opening up their wrists.
Cheery thought.
It's true. The suicide rate's always the highest around the holidays.
Now I'm depressed.
Do you ever get depressed on Christmas?
I don't celebrate Christmas.
Are you Hindu or something?
No, I just don't like to.
What's not to like?
I mean, it's a lot of fun.
God!
Say you hate Thanksgiving, and nobody cares.
But say you hate Christmas, everybody makes you feel like you're a leper.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
I'm sorry. I'm just a little tired and cranky.
Yeah.
Thanks for walking me home.
No problem.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Kate?
I was just wondering, do you get any free nights off from Dorry's?
Thursdays.
Thursdays, yeah.
Because I was just wondering...
...if you're free this Thursday night, maybe you'd like to go out on a date...
...with me?
I'd love to.
Oh, yeah?
Well, that's great!
We can talk about it on the phone and kind of...
...square everything away.
Good night, Billy.
'Night.
Hey there.
Give me your arm, boy.
Come here, come on.
Give me your arm.
No, this is not gonna hurt.
This isn't gonna hurt.
Not a big guy like you. Come on.
There you go.
See, that's not so bad. Come on.
Good, good.
Oh, that's good.
Just a little blood test, pal.
You'll never miss it.
They're like huge seedpods!
- Having fun?
- Fun!
Pretty neat, huh?
Neat!
Yum, yum! Yum, yum!
How about shutting up for a change, okay?
I already fed you.
Well, it's not 12:00 yet.
All right. Keep an eye on them, Giz.
I'll be back in a second.
Here we go.
Now maybe you guys will be quiet.
You guys are really hungry.
Giz, you want some?
Do you want some chicken?
No?
All right.
Yum, yum.
That's it, good buddy.
Call it a night.
Can't you see?
They're after you!
They're after all of us!
Our wives, our children, everyone!
They're here already!
You're next!
You're next!
You're next! You're next!
Uh-oh.
Mom?
Yeah?
Mom, could you come up here, please?
Then I want you to bring the vacuum cleaner upstairs for me.
What are they?
Well, they're the mogwai, I guess.
Except for Gizmo.
Did you get them wet?
No.
Did you feed them after midnight?
Well, I gave them some chicken.
But I made sure that it...
No, no, no. Wait a minute.
I made sure...
Mom?
What's going on here?
Yuck!
What'd you say this was called?
A putrid stage?
Pupal. Pupal stage.
Like a butterfly.
Yeah, right.
This is a cocoon, and inside he's going through changes.
Lots of changes.
Like my mother.
No, that's different.
This is called a metamorphosis.
It's a change in form...
...and in appearance.
Hello?
Hello? Hi, honey!
No, I'm sure it works fine.
I was just out on the back porch for a second.
The convention's great.
I said it's great!
Actually, the competition's...
Sorry, miss.
The competition's a little more advanced than I expected.
I was changing my oil.
Some really neat things.
Oh, Rand.
You've never been so far away on Christmas Eve before.
I know it's Christmas Eve.
I'll do the best I can.
All right. Bye-bye.
All I could get for it was $36!
If there's anything I can do...
But it's completely out of my hands.
I'll be delighted...
Hello, Gerald.
I'm under such terrible pressure.
Why don't you just speak to Mrs. Deagle about it?
Speak to Mrs. Deagle?
Mrs. Deagle!
Deposit this to my account.
Where's that psychotic canine?
Still hiding under the counter?
No, I'm afraid he's on vacation.
Better keep him behind locked doors, because if I catch him...
...he's in for a slow death.
Here's Mr. Bird's heart.
Small animals lose heat faster than large ones.
Their blood must circulate faster to keep their bodies warm.
Now, in small birds...
...their hearts beat about 600 times per minute.
Cats, 130.
Man, about 75...
...and a big old elephant's heart, only 25 a minute.
Hey, doc, you got a human heart?
Has he got a human heart?
Wait till you see this! Roll 10.
Okay, class.
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.
If any of you wanna bring me a present...
...a cassette deck wouldn't be bad.
Of course, tickets to the Super Bowl would be very nice.
Mr. Hanson, wait.
Let me just talk to you for a second.
Bye.
Billy...
It just hatched.
I'll be right there.
Hey there.
You remember me?
Remember me, don't you?
I went and got you...
...a candy bar.
I thought you might be hungry.
You hungry?
You should try one of these.
Hey there.
Come here. Don't be afraid.
There's no reason to be afraid.
Where'd you go?
Where are you?
I know you're in there.
I know you're under there.
Come on, now.
You're not still angry about that little blood test, are you?
Come on out.
Take a bite. Let me see you.
I just wanna see you.
You try some of this now.
I know you gotta be hungry.
Yum, yum.
There now. Don't you feel better?
Mr. Hanson?
Yum, yum.
Gizmo ca-ca!
Billy, are you okay?
Where are you?
Mom, they hatched.
Get out of the house.
Phone home. Ca-ca!
Mom? Mom!
Yum, yum.
Get out of my kitchen!
Neat!
Hey!
- Are you all right?
- I think so.
Mom, it's Stripe!
- Should I get it?
- Yeah, go ahead and get it.
Oh, I didn't mean that.
Hello, Dr. Molinaro. Can we come in?
My mom's had a bit of an accident.
Be careful!
What happened?
Giz?
Bright light! Bright light!
Come here.
They almost got you, huh?
Climb in here.
The question is totally without meaning.
Pardon me, sir. Stuff.
Thick and heavy.
Would 60 gallons be sufficient?
I rarely use it myself, sir.
It promotes rust.
Don't worry, Giz, we'll find him.
Gremlins, huh?
Little monsters.
- Right.
- Hundreds of them?
- I'm not sure. Maybe thousands.
Look, I know it sounds crazy.
I know it does.
But in a matter of hours, this town's gonna be a disaster area.
You've got to warn people!
- You think this kid is drunk?
- No, but you are.
I am not drunk!
Tell me something. Where do these little gremlins come from?
All right.
My father gave me one as a present.
Does your father always give you vicious little monsters?
No, they don't start out vicious at first!
Of course not.
They don't!
They look like this.
Could you dim the lights?
Sure.
Go ahead, Brent.
Dim the lights.
Gusto!
Right, Murray?
Sheila, will you quit messing with the TV?
You have the thingy.
Goddamn foreign TV.
We should've got a Zenith!
Foreigners.
I can't get a damn thing on this!
Where are you going?
I'm gonna check the antenna.
Maybe the damn thing blew down.
Be careful, dear.
What the hell is that?
- It's them!
- You're crazy!
There's a real gremlin in my cab!
Hello, Anderson.
Wanna mail something, do you?
Just a last-minute package, Father.
Be my guest.
That's strange.
Patriotic little fellow, ain't he?
Waving the flag and everything.
Be careful, Frank!
He might tear your arm off.
You want me to put the cuffs on him?
Tell me. How come a cute guy like this...
...can turn into a thousand ugly monsters?
You see, this is before it enters the pupal stage.
It multiplies with water.
Get the kid some water.
I wouldn't do that.
Sheriff's office.
Yeah, speaking.
What?
Oh, no.
Yeah, sure, we'll be right over.
What happened?
The Futtermans.
Something about a snowplow.
A freak accident.
It's the creatures!
The creatures are making it look like an accident!
Will you listen to me?
You listen to me, kid!
Go on home, take little Gizmo...
...sit by the fireplace and open your Christmas presents.
Attaboy.
Let me drive.
No, you're drunk.
You always drive!
Because I'm the sheriff, asshole.
Kopeck, you stop that, you bad kitty!
Kopeck's a bad kitty.
Ruble's a good little kitty.
We'll find you something to eat.
She's a good kitty.
Here we go. Here we go. Come on.
All right, you stop that!
Stop it!
Mean kitty, you start eating before everybody gets here.
Come on, Dollar Bill.
Yes, here we go, Dollar Bill.
Mommy'll fix you something good to eat.
Everybody here?
All right, let go of Mommy's coat.
Here.
Christmas carolers.
I hate Christmas carolers.
Screechy-voiced little glue-sniffers.
I warned you brats!
Ya-ya-ya! Ya-ya-ya!
What are they?
What are they?!
They're here!
They've come for me!
They've come!
I'm not ready.
I'm not ready yet.
I'm not ready!
My God, Frye!
That was Mrs. Deagle.
Get them off! Get them off! Help me!
That's Dave Myers.
He does Santa every year.
What the hell is he doing now?
What's that stuff he's got all over him?
Frank, I really think we should go now.
Start the car. I'd really like to go back to the station.
Please!
Frank!
Jesus, Frank!
What the hell are those things?
It's Christmas.
What the hell's going on?
Shut up, will you?!
I don't believe it.
You're on with Rockin' Ricky! Go!
Hi, my name's Pete.
These green guys are running around wrecking things.
This is Christmas, not Halloween!
Listen, gang.
Rockin' Ricky's getting fed up with this Orson Welles crap!
What's that? Kitty, what's that?
Some of Rockin' Ricky fans?
You're not a Rockin' Ricky fan!
Sir, I notice that you're a smoker.
I notice that you're a smoker.
I see the cigarettes.
I noticed, here, this broken ashtray.
It's very fortunate that I happened to come by.
Let me introduce myself. My name's
Randall Peltzer. I'm an inventor.
"Fantastic Ideas for a Fantastic World. "
I make the illogical logical.
I have something here that I think you might be interested in.
Yes, sir, I do.
This is...
...the Peltzer Smokeless Ashtray.
I think this can solve your problem here, sir.
Please don't bite me!
Wait a minute.
You all right?
Let's get out of here!
What's that?
Don't worry. He's with me.
He's not one of them.
What's wrong?
Why isn't the car starting?
We're gonna have to make a run for it, okay?
One, two, three!
They've been here too.
What are these things?
Where do they come from?
They're gremlins, Kate.
Just like Mr. Futterman said.
Now I have another reason to hate Christmas.
What are you talking about?
The worst thing that ever happened to me was on Christmas.
Oh, God. It was so horrible.
It was Christmas Eve.
I was 9 years old.
Me and Mom were decorating the tree...
...waiting for Dad to come home from work.
A couple hours went by.
Dad wasn't home.
So Mom called the office.
No answer.
Christmas Day came and went, and still nothing.
So the police began a search.
Four or five days went by.
Neither one of us could eat or sleep.
Everything was falling apart.
It was snowing outside.
The house was freezing, so I went to try to light up the fire.
That's when I noticed the smell.
The firemen came and broke through the chimney top.
And me and Mom were expecting them to pull out a dead cat or a bird.
And instead they pulled out my father.
He was dressed in a Santa Claus suit.
He'd been climbing down the chimney...
...his arms loaded with presents.
He was gonna surprise us.
He slipped and broke his neck.
He died instantly.
And that's how I found out there was no Santa Claus.
Don't worry about that smoke.
It'll stop. It's guaranteed.
Barney, shut up!
Don't start with me.
I got a long way to go.
Shut up!
Where did they all go?
It'll be light soon.
I bet they're all together someplace dark.
Mogwai!
Shh, Gizmo.
They're inside.
All of them?
Milk Duds.
What are they doing?
They're watching Snow White.
And they love it.
Where's the boiler room?
It's in the back of the theater.
Down there.
Milk Duds.
Yum, yum.
Cover your mouth.
Don't breathe any gas.
Billy!
Go.
Billy!
Billy!
- Hurry up!
- Move, Katie! Watch out!
Come on!
Billy...
In the department store.
Stripe!
That's Stripe.
He's the leader.
If he gets to water, it'll start all over again.
Take Giz, go back and try and find some kind of light switch.
Careful, Billy.
Ward is your snowplow headquarters.
Attention, Christmas shoppers.
Saturday morning at 8:30, we'll have
Santa Claus for all the kiddies.
We have the Kingston Falls...
Attention, shoppers.
Light bright!
Bye-bye.
It takes a certain kind of guy.
And that guy needs a certain kind of dame.
Water!
Gun!
It's been a rough night for Rockin' Ricky...
...but he's still on the air!
The Marines are standing by with fire hoses.
Billy.
Gizmo ca-ca!
Light bright! Light bright!
What the hell is that?
Your scarf.
We switch to a report...
...from the scene of the Christmas Eve riots.
This is Lew Landers,
WDHB's Action Central News...
...at the site of Dorry's Tavern...
...or what used to be Dorry's Tavern, in Kingston Falls...
...where officials blame...
...mass hysteria for the escalating series of unexplained...
...accidents, fires and explosions that rocked this once-peaceful town...
...on Christmas Eve.
The bizarre demise of Mrs. Ruby Deagle, widow...
...of convicted stock-swindler
Donald Deagle...
Don't chew that.
Don't chew.
I bet he'd like some chicken soup.
Honey, this is the gentleman who sold me the mogwai.
"Sold. " An interesting choice of words.
Conflicting eyewitness reports concerning "little green men"...
You teach him to watch television?
There was, I believe, a box.
Dad...
Rand, your scarf.
I warned you.
With mogwai comes much responsibility.
But you didn't listen.
And you see what happens.
I didn't mean it.
You do with mogwai what your society...
...has done with all of nature's gifts.
You do not understand.
You are not ready.
Papa?
Yes?
He has something to say to you.
You understand what he says when he speaks to you?
To hear, one has only to listen.
Bye, Billy.
Perhaps someday you may be ready.
Until then, mogwai...
...will be waiting.
Excuse me, sir.
Before you go, I wanted to tell you...
...that I am truly sorry for what's happened.
And if you would accept it,
I'd like to...
...give you this small token.
There's one other one.
This is an invention of mine.
Smokeless Ashtray.
How did you know?
Man at gas station tried to sell me.
Latest word in technology.
Very generous of you.
I'm sure it will come in handy.
Bye-bye, woof-woof.
Well, that's the story.
So if your air conditioner goes on the fritz, your washing machine blows up...
...or your video recorder conks out...
...before you call the repairman...
...turn on the lights, check the closets and cupboards...
...look under all the beds.
Because you never can tell.
There just might be a gremlin in your house.
Have you done this sort of thing before?
Me? Of course. I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
- Looting and pillaging, eh?
- Yes. - What about the raping?
- Shut up. - Well, it's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
- Do you like women? - What?
- Of course I like women... I love 'em.
- You don't love me.
- Well, no, I don't...
Mind you, I'm not saying
I couldn't get to like you.
As a matter of fact I actually prefer it if there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
What? Rape? No. Obviously then it wouldn't be rape... then, would it?
Get it over with.
I don't suppose you... No... no.
- What?
- I don't suppose you...
- You do like me at all?
- What d'you expect?
You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me.
You don't like it, do you? Well I just think it's a little bit crude, that's all.
What about all the killing and looting?
That's just as crude, isn't it?
- Well, you have to do them.
- Why?
Why do you have to go around killing and looting all the time?
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
But that's a circular argument!
If the only reason for the expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
Stop talking as if we were married!
Well you started it.
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
And I was just saying that rape is no more point- less or crude than all the killing and looting.
Scream.
Louder.
- Aaagh! Rape!
- Oh, thanks.
- Rape?
- Where?
He raped me standing up.
- You finished, then?
- I suppose so...
Right!
Leave her alone!
No!
Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.
- I didn't mean to!
- Oh, that's all right then...
It's the thought that counts.
You told them I raped you, why?
I dunno... you looked so... vulnerable.
Why should you care?
Why... should you care?
Tell me your name?
Tell me... what is it?
If you ever thought of converting my dear, now would be
- an ideal opportunity...
- Not now!
- No, of course not...
- But, er, you might not get another chance.
- Go away!
Right. I 'll pray for you my dear.
Yes... That's what I'll do, dear.
I'll pray for you.
Let her go!
- Why?
- Why should we let her go?
We haven't hit a single braid yet!
- He hit my wife!
- That showed her.
What's the matter?
We're missing the fun.
- What's it all about, grandpa?
- What?
We toil and labour, we loot and pillage,
- we rape and kill, and yet ...
- Why're you talking this piffle, son?
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
Who you've been talking to?
- I met this girl...
- Women!
It's always the women who causes all the trouble.
- She got me thinking...
- So? What'd you do to her?
I killed her.
That's my boy!
Freya!
Erik the Viking.
What can you want with me,
Erik the Viking?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come.
Afraid they will make fun of you for listening to an old woman's stories?
Young men only interested in fighting and killing.
Yes... but has it always been like that?
Since the beginning of time?
- What do you see, Erik?
- I see... the world.
Is it night or day, Erik?
- It is day, of course, Freya.
- Is it winter or summer, Erik?
The winter has passed.
It is... summer.
Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?
No, it's up beyond the clouds where it always is.
But have you ever seen it, Erik?
Of course not.
Think back.
I remember once as a child...
...a dream.
It was as if the whole sky were... blue...
It was blue, Erik... once.
The Old Stories tell of an age that would come such as this when Fenrir the Wolf would swallow the sun, and a Great Winter would settle on the world.
It was to be an axe age, a sword age, a storm age, when brother would turn against brother, and men would fight each other until the world was finally destroyed.
Then this is the Age of Ragnarok?
Wait, Freya!
Is there nothing men can do?
The Gods are asleep, Erik.
I will go and wake them up then!
Tell me what I must do!
Far out in the midst of the
Western Ocean there is a land, men call it Hy-Brasil.
There you will find a horn this horn is called Resounding.
You must take the Horn Resounding and three times you must blow it.
The first note will take you to Asgaard.
The second note will awaken the Gods.
And the third note will bring you home.
But remember, Erik once you are in the spell of the Horn, hatred will destroy you.
Will the dead ever return, Freya?
That I cannot tell you.
Oh, come on, Erik!
Erik, what are you doing? Thorfinn just said that Sven's grandfather died of old age.
- He must fight to the death.
- That's right! Sven must kill me.
Aren't you afraid of death,
Thorfinn Skull-Splitter?
Not death by the sword!
It means I shall drink in Valhalla with the great warriors.
You don't believe in this
Valhalla nonsense, do you?
- Go away.
Right. Fine.
Just checking.
And you, Sven, aren't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge
- to Asgaard?
- I will join my grandfather there.
He's not in Valhalla!
He died of old age!
You liar!
Stop it! Stop it!
- There's only one way to settle it.
- He must kill me!
- Ya!
- There is another way.
- Who gets killed?
- Nobody gets killed.
- Oh, well...
It'll be dangerous.
Maybe none of us will return.
Ah well, that's much more sensible than just Thorfinn getting killed.
- Shall we all go and pack now?
- What are you talking about, Erik?
What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
- Find the Rainbow Bridge?
- Find it... and cross it!
Look! You can't find somewhere that doesn't exist.
- Shut up!
- Right.
Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.
What's the matter?
Are you afraid to try?
- Of course we're not afraid to try, but...
- But what?
- But... what?
- Nobody's ever crossed the
Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.
- We'd be the first!
- You mean we'd be dead?
No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods.
But how?
I don't know.
But I'm not afraid to try.
- Well, I'm not afraid of anything.
- Neither am I.
Then you'll come?
Wish you were going too?
Don't. Too busy.
Ooh, that's a good one!
You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.
Yes, it is good.
But I told him ten, Loki.
You could charge him what you like.
You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand.
You could charge Halfdan twenty for that and he'd pay it.
Oh, I couldn't do that!
The Blacksmith's Code says that...
Yes, yes... of course... the "Blacksmith's Code"...
If this is the Age of Ragnarok,
Keitel Blacksmith, it is good to us.
Can't make enough swords!
Can't make enough axe-heads!
But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods...
They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
The Age of Ragnarok ends and...
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
It's not just your livelihood at stake but your son's, and - well - the livelihood of all blacksmiths.
- My brothers blacksmiths.
- That's right.
- And the Blacksmith's code says that we must...
- ...honor and protect all Blacksmith's.
Together we stand!
You just can't let Erik do that.
- Got both axes?
- Yes, mother.
- And something to sharpen them with?
- Yes, mum.
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
- No, mother.
- And keep your sword greased.
- Yes, mother.
- Goodbye, dad.
- Don't forget to wash,
- you know... all over!
- No, Dad.
And if you have to kill somebody, kill them! Don't stop to think about it.
I never do.
- It's a tradition.
- I know, Dad. Yout told me...
I was a Berserk for King Harald
Fairhair...
- You went berserk...
- I went berserk in every battle
I ever fought for King Harald...
- So did your father...
- So did my father...
- and his father before him.
- But it's a responsibility...
- But it's a responsibility
- being a Berserk.
- I must only let the red rage...
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
I know!
I've heard it all a thousand times!
No, no, no... you'll never make a Berserk.
If you let it out now, you'll have nothing left for battle.
Besides... it's dangerous.
It's the end of a family tradition.
- Sorry.
- Yah, well...
- You will wait?
- What you'd expect me to do?
Take this for luck.
That's what they call me:
Leif the Lucky.
Please.
You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.
No. But I do hope to do a little business on the way.
You're wasting your time.
Listen... I have been in this dump for 16 years and I have not made a single convert in all that time.
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted her.
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
Same thing, isn't it?
No, it is not.
Well... we'll be off now...
Say something a little more than that!
Oh... er... right...
Mum...
Don't be sad. You all know why we're going... so... don't grieve.
Maybe untold dangers do lie ahead of us, and some of you may well be looking at the one's you love for the last time.
But don't grieve! You see, even if the Hordes of Muspel tear us limb from limb or the Fire Giants burn each and every one of us to a cinder... even if we're swallowed by the Dragon of the North Sea or fall off the Edge of the World... don't cry.
No! Don't cry...
It's all fantasy, there's no
Edge of the World,
Theres is no Dragon of the North Sea.
That's what you say.
- What's the matter with them?
- Say something cheerful.
Cheerful... right.
Well... cheers everybody!
Don't go!
My son!
I don't want you to go!
- I don't want me to go, either...
- Oh gods! Please, everybody! Keep calm!
Listen, it's not certain all of us are going to die... and in any case we may not die hideous deaths...
- We'd best be going.
- Right.
Farewell, and for the last time may the gods...
Don't say anything else!
Wait, Erik!
You can't go without me.
Who will sharpen your swords and mend your shields?
- Oh no!
- Not him too!
What's the matter now?
If Keitel Blacksmith goes with you... we'll have no one to do the things he did for us.
Or sharpen our knives and mend our pans.
Well you have Loki, Keitel's assistant, to do all that.
Loki?
What's the matter with Loki?
He's become quite good at blacksmithing.
Well, yes... but...
He's so small and...
Oh, yes... we've got Loki.
That's true...
Hey, you two! What's going on?
- I was sitting there.
- No, you were'nt!
Leifs sitting here.
I need a bit of luck.
- Look, I bagged it last week.
- It doesn't matter where you sit!
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
Well, what difference does it make where you're sitting?
I don't want to have to sit next to Snorri all that time.
- Thank you very much indeed.
- Stop it!
So nice if you're wanted.
Sven, sit back there. Leif, you better sit here.
And Harald sit here.
Trust me to get the missionary.
What are you doing here?
You might need a real Berserk.
- I am one, Dad!
- We haven't got a spare place.
He can have my place.
I don't really want to go anyway.
- Stay where you are!
- He could have Bjorn's place.
- Bjorn's not coming.
- What's the matter with Bjorn?
Halfdan the Black chopped off both his hands last night.
- He was lucky.
- Well... sit there.
You can't have Sven's dad sitting next to Sven - they'll argue the whole time.
That's true.
Sven, sit behind Thorfinn.
And you sit there, and you sit there, and you sit there.
Now you've got all the big ones on one side.
All right. Thangbrand sit where Ornulf is.
Ornulf sit where Ulf is.
Ulf sit where Thangbrand was.
Ragnar sit behind Thorfinn.
Thorfinn stay where you are.
- I wanted to sit next to Leif.
- Shut up.
Sven switch with Snorri.
Snorri sit behind Sven.
Keitel sit here, Harald there,
Leif there, Bjarni there.
Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other.
- That doesn't matter.
- Erik! Wait!
Here, son.
Your father always made sure he could rest his head at night.
I can't take that on a voyage!
It was your father's! It was the pillow he took with him.
He said it once saved his life.
Please!
Thanks, Mum.
Row! Row!
What's your business?
I wish to speak to Halfdan
The Black.
- He's too busy.
- I have money. See!
Come along, Hecate.
Look, I'm not an unreasonable man, Thord
Andersson, but this is the second chance
- that I've given you.
- But I'm a poor man, Sir.
Yes, but it's not just me, you see.
A lot of people depend on this money.
I really can't give you a third chance, I'm so sorry.
- Would you please behead him, please?
- Oh no! Take all my sheep, all of them.
Oh, that's a good idea.
Take all his sheep.
If only they'd think ahead.
I really wish they would.
Ah the blacksmith's assistant from Ravenfjord.
- Garrotte him, would you please.
- Oh, no.
My Lord, Halfdan the Black.
You've brought me more swords?
I bring more than swords.
I bring a warning from my master.
- A warning?
- No!
- Flay them both alive would you?
- No, it's a mistake.
Erik and the men of Ravensfjord are setting off to cross
- the Western Ocean.
- Lucky things!
I could do with a holiday, I can tell you.
All this financial work, you know...
The stress really gets you.
Flay him alive, garrotte him and then behead him.
No, I'm not Hildir Eysteinsson!
I'm Hjalti Skeggjason!
You've got the wrong man.
They seek to drive Fenrir the
Wolf from the sky to waken the Gods and to bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end.
- End Ragnarok?
- Who do they think they are?
- Er, just cut his hand off.
- Oh, thank you my lord.
Thank you, a million thanks yous. You can cut them both off if you want. Thank you very much.
So why should you tell me all this?
Because, my lord, my livelihood depends on Ragnarok.
Like yours.
And of course if anything should happen to your master you would become blacksmith of Ravensfjord.
Have a good look. That's the last we shall see of old Norway.
Goodbye home... goodbye loved ones...
- goodbye lunch...
- Oh! Shut up.
- You know, my son, our lord said...
- Your lord.
- Quite... my lord said: The Prayer of Faith shall save the sick.
I hope the Dragon of North Sea gets you and your lord.
Darkness and ignorance...
You all right?
No, I'm not.
You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
I mean many of the greatest sailors were pukers.
I know. I know.
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage.
The whole time. Non-stop.
Puke... puke... puke.
Look! I don't feel bad about it.
I just feel ill.
- He used to puke in his sleep.
- Oh, bastard.
Thorfinn.
- No, no. Put it away. Break out the oars.
- What are you talking about?
- Break out the oars! Come on, move it!
- We've only just started cooking supper.
- It's Halfdan the Black!
- I know. Snorre, get your oar out.
Do you suppose he wants to stop us waking the Gods?
- What do you think?
- How could he know... unless...
So yor're gonna run away from him, Erik?
Row, Thorfinn Skull-Splitter.
And you, Keitel Blacksmith.
I gave an order.
Or didn't you hear?
We don't get anywhere if we fight.
Row!
Faster.
We can't keep this up!
Row, row, row, row.
And up!
- The Gates of the World...
- What?
We have passed through the
Gates of the World.
No we are in the Unknown...
Look!
I never thought I should live to see the sun again.
Where?
So that is what the sun looks like!
Should the sun do that?
Excuse me. What are you looking at?
Look out!
It's not the sun!
- What is it?
- It's the Dragon of the North Sea!
Ah! That's why I can't see it.
Some dragon! Ooh!
What a hell...
Look out!
Row!
What's all the panic about?
- The Dragon...
- Children afraid of the dark.
Slower. Nobody can row at that speed.
Oh sorry.
- Man overboard!
- Slower!
In... Out...
In... Out...
We're being attacked!
No, no Sven...
We must kill!
No good going berserk against a dragon!
Faster!
Make your mind up.
Keep up the strike!
Stop it!
Row... row!
- What are you doing?
- It saved my father!
- Erik!
- Row! Keep rowing!
His dad was the same. Used to take forty winks in the middle of a battle.
Just shut up!
Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?
He done!
Death to dragons!
Red mist!
Barmy!
Take a deep breath!
It's at time like this that this book is most useful.
I'll take that.
Shut up and row you idiot!
Breathe in, you cod-brain!
Hold on tight!
Urgh! What's it been eating?
Get back! Look out!
- Who was that?
- Leif the Lucky.
I can't hang on!
- Let me go, Sven.
- What are you talking about?
- I'm not worth you're risking your life for!
- I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith!
If you go... I go too...
Hang on!
First we're flying now we're sinking!
Who are we fooling?
This is hopeless!
Let's all sing something!
Anyone know any good drowning songs?
Listen!
Maybe we won't get to Hy-Brasil!
Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding, but at least we've tried and at least we shall have died like men.
- Like fish.
- Shut up.
Erik's right!
We'll all meet in Valhalla.
I don't want to die!
Isn't there anybody who'd like to be christened before we go down?
It can't do you any harm.
- What do we have to do?
- Nothing at all.
I simply immerse you in water...
- Get lost!
- Right.
Don't let me drown, Thorfinn!
Oh Odin! Not me, I'm too young.
Please not me.
Perhaps I'd rather drown.
Till we meet in Valhalla.
- How deep is the ocean?
- Very deep... usually.
Wait, wait wait!
Nobody kill anybody!
What is it?
- It's the Dragon again!
- No... no, it isn't.
The sun! That's it!
The sky's blue.
The sun!
Erik!
Look!
- She's got no clothes on!
- It's disgusting.
Get her weapons.
She hasn't got any.
She must have a knife or something...
What kind of place is this?
Maybe they've got weapons we haven't even dreamed of...
- Let's hack her to pieces.
- No.
- Well, what else do we do?
- How about making friends?
- "Friends"?
- What's wrong with making friends?
You don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make "friends".
We can make "friends" at home...
Welcome!
- What did you say?
- I said you're welcome.
- Welcome?
- Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
How d'you know we're "friends"?
Well, everyone is friends here on Hy-Brasil.
Hy-Brasil?
Is this Hy-Brasil?
Well, of course.
Please, please, what are those?
- What are what?
- Those things in your hands.
These? What are these?
They're swords.
Oh no! No! Put them down!
Please, please put them down!
- What's the matter?
- Please! You don't know what you're doing!
- Make them put them down.
- Why?
Yes, why?
Why?
Yes.
But surely you know?
- No.
- Know what?
Well, the wonderful blessing under which we live here on Hy-Brasil!
- No... we don't.
- The Gods decreed that if ever swords spilled human blood upon these shores, the whole of Hy-Brasil would sink beneath the waves.
That's terrible!
- You mean if just one person gets killed?
- This whole place would sink?
- Yes!
- You mean, you can't kill anybody?
- Right! Isn't it wonderful?
- What? Not being able to kill anybody?
- Well, of course.
But how?
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
Well obviously there's no killing.
- But how d'you take revenge?
- How do you punish people?
- How do you defend yourselves?
- We don't have to.
We're all terribly nice to each other.
- All the time?
- Well, of course! We have to be.
Being nice to each other is what it's all about.
We're terribly nice to each other
We're friendly bold and free.
We never say anything nasty
- 'cause we dare not.
- No sirreeeee!
- Would you like us to sing to you?
- Sing?
Well, that's very kind of you, but we're in a hurry and...
What's the matter? Don't you want to hear our singing?
Oh, yes of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and...
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
- No, no, no, no, it's just the Horn Resounding...
- A lot of people like our singing,
- Well, I'm sure it's lovely.
- But you don't want to hear it.
No, no, no. We'd love to hear it, wouldn't we?
- Yes.
- Well, you'll have to ask us really nicely.
Er, well, we'd be terribly grateful if you would sing for us.
- You're just saying that.
- Well, of course he is!
Of course we're not. We would genuinely like to hear you sing.
- Really?
- Really.
And you're not just saying that because you think we want you to?
No.
Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes... tum-tum-tum-tum-ti-tum-tum
But it's not the one we're best at.
- Couldn't we do the one that goes
"Tum-ti-tum-ti-tum-ti-tum"?
Not when we've got visitors.
Ah! The musicians!
Oh dear, I'm sure you're not going to like this.
It's, it's just no good,
We are not a musical nation...
No, no, no it was, it was very... nice.
Really.
Now, I want you to be absolutely, totally, genuinely honest with me.
Did you really, truly, honestly like it?
No.
They didn't like it.
Oh my God. I want to die!
Your Majesty, we come from a world where there is no music.
Where Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun.
A world where men live and die by the axe and by the sword.
- Well, how do you think I feel?
- We must find the Horn Resounding!
Is it here on Hy-Brasil?
- I'll tell you what.
- Yes?
We'll do the one that goes
"Tum-tum-tum-tum-ti-tum-tum".
Perhaps you'll like that one better.
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
You mean got into bed with them?
No. Of course not, silly.
I mean... felt like this about them?
You mean you have got into bed with somebody else?
No, I mean... have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you've met someone you really can believe in with your whole heart?
Someone whose goals suddenly seem to be your goals.
Whose dreams become your dreams.
Have you ever been to bed with anyone else?
Why do you go on about that?
You've felt like this before.
It, it was different.
What was she like?
Well, I didn't know her very well...
But, but you loved her all the same?
- We never went to bed together.
- Why do you go on about that?
You have been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
- I've never loved anybody!
- I've never been to bed with anybody!
Aud? Open up!
It's my father.
I know you're in there.
Aud? Do you hear me?
Oh no! Halfdan!
- I would walk right in and surprise you.
- Throw this over you.
Right!
Well... Where is he?
- Who father?
- Who?
- Who, whoever you've got in here of course!
- But there is no one, father.
I smell one of those foreigners.
That's who it is, isn't it?
- He's the fifth one this week.
- Fifth?
- All right, where is he?
- There's no one here, father. Look for yourself.
He wouldn't be a midget, Father!
Ah! So you admit there could be someone here.
- Ah, you're losing your temper!
- Of course I'm not, my dear.
I'd never lose my temper.
Oh dear, more visitors!
Ah-ha, right!
Come on! Come out of there!
Come out like a man. I know you're in there.
It's all in your own mind, father.
It's you who is always imagining that I'm up here with some man or other.
I don't know how you do it, Aud
I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic in you.
There's no magic, father.
My mother had no magic.
She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
- Oh, it's your fantasy.
- But I'll catch you.
Like I caught her.
The Cloak Invisible.
It was my mother's parting gift.
Fifth one this week!
Can I have my shirt back please?
Oh for goodness' sake!
And I thought you said it was something special.
Oh, Erik, that's just what I am trying to tell you, you are.
- Five this week, how many the week before?
- Oh! You're as bad as my father.
- And the week before that?
- Erik!
- Yes?
- I just want to help you to get to Asgaard.
- I mustn't let him land!
- Who?
Halfdan the Black.
I feel strange.
What? Sort of wobbly and excited?
- Sort of.
- Oh, that's fear.
Thorfinn doesn't know the meaning of fear.
Is it sort of like a sinking feeling in your stomach?
- That's it!
- But you're not even afraid of death, Thorfinn!
- I know, I know.
- It's magic.
- What magic?
- I've heard of a magic that strikes fear into the heart so you cannot fight.
Yes... I can feel it.
I always feel like this!
It's not magic!
It's just a trick!
Don't you feel it?
All right. If they're using magic we'll use magic of our own!
Aud!
Why didn't you come up by the stairs?
- Just give me a hand.
- I mean, you could have killed yourself.
- Where's the Cloak Invisible?
- Why?
I can't see it! Have you got another man in here already?
It's in that chest.
- There isn't another man. Oh no, no.
- I'll bring it back.
- No, Erik, you don't understand.
- No. It's you who doesn't understand.
Halfdan the Black has come to kill and destroy.
We brought him here. We must stop him.
- You don't realize...
- Goodbye, Aud.
- Thanks!
- No, wait, Erik.
The Cloak Invisible, it only seems to work on my father!
- And a sort of slightly sick feeling?
- That's right!
And you keep wanting to go to the toilet.
Oh, yes! I noticed that!
Shut up, you two.
You're making us all nervous.
So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he?
Well, I have here a magic to match his!
- What is it?
- A magic dish cloth.
To the oars!
Row! Row!
Nuschelnde, Hosen tragende Westlinge, die kein Mensch verstehen kann!
Ihr seht doch alle gleich aus!
Wie ich euer Milch-Gesaufe hasse!
Eure fehlenden Ahnenreihen!
Ihr k枚nnt ja nicht mal aus einer Sch眉ssel essen!
I don't think it would be so bad, if we knew what he was saying...
Ruhe!
Du ungehobelter Reispudding-Fresser!
Wie ich eure Plumpheit hasse!
Wie ich eure merkw眉rdige Schrift hasse!
Ihr habt doch noch nie im Leben rituellen Selbstmord begangen!
Erik!
What magic have you brought?
You'll see!
Open wide.
All right! Here it is. Here is the magic from the King's daughter!
- How did he do that then?
- Do what?
- Vanish.
- He hasn't.
Where is he then?
He's there!
Oh dear! I've done it.
Oh, yes.
Oh! Scary, scary, don't we look mean?
You can't see me!
But I can see you!
Eure fettbr眉stigen Weiber mit ihrem aufgew盲rmten Fisch widern mich an!
What's the matter? Haven't you seen anybody fight before?
- No. They're usually too scared of us.
- Kill him!
- There, that's a true Berserk.
- Well I'm... I'm just building up to it, Dad.
The fear's gone! Kill!
Now you see me...
Now you don't.
What?
- Well, come on!
- I... I...
Hang the Blacksmith's Code!
I am the air! I am the wind!
Fight damn you, fight!
- Well go on, go berserk!
- Oh give us a chance, dad!
- What about you, why don't you go berserk?
- Got to keep my eye on him.
This is the life, eh?
Erik! Kill!
Thorfinn! Look out!
Now row. Row, you moron!
Thorfinn! You can't die!
I'm not frightened of anything.
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla.
No... he's not... not there.
Tell him I'm coming.
No! Wait, wait, Erik.
Erik, wait.
Loki. What are you doing here?
Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods so
I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
- To save you, Erik.
- But...
It, it was my master Keitel's idea.
Wasn't it, Keitel?
Well I...
Yes. I thought that...
But...
How is it that you can see me?
You can all see me?
- What do you mean?
- Why shouldn't we see you?
Well, I can't see him
I'm wearing the Cloak Invisible.
Oh, there you are.
- You mean you could all see me this whole time? - Weren't we supposed to?
Oh! I feel a little er...
Erik, we are grateful to you and to your men.
- Yes, we are.
- And there is only one way we know to repay you. Musicians!
We would love to hear you sing again, but what we'd really appreciate would be, if you could see your way to lending not giving of course, but just lending us the... um well, to be quite blunt, the Horn Resounding.
It's yours.
- Is that it?
- Is there something the matter with it?
No, no, it's just I didn't expect it to be quite so big.
Well, it's not called Horn
Resounding for nothing, you know.
- You do know how to play the horn, do you?
- What?
- You do know how to play the horn, do you?
- Yes, sir, yes.
Then I expect you'll be leaving first thing in the morning, eh?
Keitel! Keitel Blacksmith!
Let's talk, Keitel Blacksmith!
Have you forgotten why you came on this voyage?
Do you want Erik to wake the Gods?
How can we stop him now?
Take this. And throw it from the cliff heights.
They'll never be able to make the
Horn Resounding sound without it.
Why me?
Why don't you do it?
Hurry!
Surely you haven't forgotten your Blacksmith's Oath?
Hurry!
Or I might have to tell Erik why you really came on this voyage.
- Who's that?
- It's only me.
- I was just going out to water the dragon.
- Clumsy idiot.
The Blacksmith's Code.
- Keitel!
- What?
- What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
- Get away, Snorri.
- What have you got there?
- Get off! Snorri, get back...
Oh no!
Oh Gods!
What have we done?
Stay calm! This is not happening.
What did he say?
Now, I know what some of you must be thinking the day has come we're all going down, etc, etc.
But let's get away from the fantasy and look at the facts.
We, er, do seem to be going down quite fast, Your Majesty.
Not trying to contradict you, of course.
Oh no, no, of course you're not, citizen. But let's stick to the facts.
The threat of total destruction has kept the peace here in Hy-Brasil for one thousand years.
So whatever else is happening, you can rest assured,
Hy-Brasil is not sinking.
Repeat: not sinking!
May I just make a point in support of what King Arnulfs just said?
- Oh, we, we'd be delighted, wouldn't we?
- Yes, we'd certainly like to hear what one of us has got to say.
Save yourselves!
Hy-Brasil is sinking.
Ah, but you don't know our safety precautions.
- It can't happen.
- But it is, look!
I've already appointed the
Chancellor as chairman of a full committee of inquiry into exactly what is going on, and in the meantime I suggest we have a sing-song!
Good idea!
- I can't swim!
- Relax! Relax!
Relax? I'm drowning! Help!
I can't swim!
- Let go!
- Help!
Excuse me!
- You hit him! - Well, that's what you're supposed to do. Isn't it?
Look!
Aud!
- You know, I think we're getting better.
- How can you tell?
Father!
It's all right, it's not happening!
- Father, it is!
- Get on board!
- No thanks!
- Who do you think you are?
- Panic-mongers!
- Come on over here!
- Leave us alone!
- Yeah. Leave 'em alone.
- It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!
- Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in and I happen to have more experience of these matters than you do I think.
Father.
It's times like this my child, when this book and I ... right.
We must blow the first note.
The note that will take us to Asgaard.
Over the Edge of the World.
We are going where only the dead have been before.
Here, let me have a go.
- It's all so hard.
- You're not using the right technique.
No, I'm doing it.
- Look, you're always telling me... telling me...
Stop it!
- Why can't you let me do something for myself? Just the once? - No!
Don't fight! We're never going to get where we want to go if you fight.
Um, don't blow it, you don't know what might happen.
It has not spoken for a thousand years.
You must bring it to life... with a kiss.
Help!
- What are you doing?
- What do you think we're doing? Help!
Somebody help us?
- Shut up!
- She wants to kill us!
She wants to take us over the Edge of the World!
There is no Edge of the World.
There is no dragon... Right!
- You do want to get to Asgaard, don't you?
- How do we know that's the way?
- We blew the Horn Resounding.
- She blew the Horn Resounding.
Don't you see, Erik!
She wants revenge!
- What are you talking about?
- Shut up! - She knows it was our fault!
Shut your mouth, Keitel!
No, Loki!
I should never have listened to you!
You've lost your mind!
We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik!
But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!
You fool!
- I should have got rid of you long ago!
- Like you got rid of Snorri?
No!
No!
We are in the spell of the Horn!
- Hatred will destroy us.
- That's right!
Hatred will destroy you.
He killed Snorri! He caused the land of Hy-Brasil to sink!
- She knew!
- I didn't know!
Now she wants to take us over the Edge of the World!
Well, how else do you think we're going to get to Asgaard?
Do you know the way to Asgaard,
Keitel Blacksmith?
Do you, Sven?
There is only one road before us, and it leads over the Edge of the World.
No! Don't look over the Edge!
Don't!
- Let me see!
- No. Don't look.
- The abyss will suck away your strength.
- I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
- What do they see?
- You still want to go to Asgaard?
Of course.
Do you believe I love you?
You don't have to love me.
Just ... you believe I love you?
Yes, I do.
Then let go!
- I'm still seeing stars.
- We're all seeing stars.
No! I was hit on the head.
Wake up!
Don't sleep!
Wake up!
Bi-Frost...
The Rainbow Bridge.
Wake up. Wake up!
Are we dead?
Asgaard!
- Where?
- Up there, you fathead.
Look at it! It's real.
Hallucinations are real.
Blow the second note.
The second note.
The note to wake the Gods.
Gently.
Erik! You've done what you came to do?
Not quite.
Blow the third note! The note to take you home!
There is something I must ask the Gods...
No living man has ever entered the Halls of Asgaard...
The Gods will never let you return.
I came to find my grandfather.
I have to go...
- Then I shall come too.
- No... no..
I don't want to live without you.
Oh, Aud...
I ... I came here to find... someone.
I'm sorry. I really am.
Valhalla!
There, you see?
It's solid!
It's real.
Now do you believe us?
There's nothing there.
If you see...
Ha, ha, ha!
You're all having me on, aren't you?
It's Valhalla.
Where the warriors slain in battle go.
- It doesn't exist for him.
- He hasn't got an ounce of faith in him.
Listen!
Oh good! It's Mr. Wonderful!
I've come to take you back to the land of the living.
What a stupid idea.
Why?
Well, what's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
I'll ask the Gods to give you life again!
Who is he talking to?
Right.
Have you ever tried asking the Gods for anything?
No.
- Odin!
- I'm busy.
Odin?
He's busy.
- Is that Odin? - You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
Odin!
We come from the world of Midgard.
Clear off.
No, wait, Thor.
- You have to help us.
- We don't have to help anybody.
Fenrir the Wolf covers the Sun.
Men fight
- and kill each other all the time.
- This is ridiculous.
Why should we care?
- Because you're the Gods.
- So?
So bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed.
Erik the Viking, the things you seek are not in our power.
We don't make men love each other, or hate each other.
But you're the Gods!
Look Erik...
Dad?
How can you tell?
I'll never forget him!
- The bastard! - Dad!
- He drove me mad!
Easy, Dad!
All his "You'll never be a berserk if you lose your temper"...
- I hate you!
- Dad!
You won, Sven.
What right have you to try and stop men fighting, Erik the Viking?
There is glory in battle.
Riches to be made and won.
Made by you, Loki!
By you, Keitel Blacksmith.
Don't you know, Erik, that's why he went with you.
Ragnarok was good for his business.
It's not my business any more!
Fenrir the Wolf is gone, Erik.
But will men cease fighting each other?
That is not in our power.
I have one more request before we return.
Return? You have set your foot in the Halls of Asgaard, Erik.
- You cannot return.
- But it's all in your imagination.
- Whatever it is.
- You're the only one who can do it.
Please.
Oh, allright.
You mean we must stay here forever?
Stay here? This is Valhalla.
This is reserved for those slain-in-battle.
- Yeah, we're the lucky ones!
- Yeah, it's better than dying of old age.
For you there is only the Pit of Hell!
Son! My son!
- Get lost!
- Dad!
- Grandfather!
- Sven!
- I tried to save you.
- Why should you care?
I don't know! I just did!
- Erik!
- No. Let go, Snorri!
- I've got you!
- Hold on!
I've got you!
I've got you, Sven!
Listen! Listen!
The third note!
I want to go home.
I don't believe it!
It brought us home!
- But who blew it!?
- Well, who cares, we're home!
- Mum! Dad!
- We're home!
Throw down your weapons or we kill the children.
Get 'em back!
Well, now we'll kill the children anyway.
Mind your heads!
Harald!
Mum! Mum! Hello, mum!
My boy! My boy!
Look!
- Hello, Mummy!
- Hello, darling.
- Any presents for me?
- A surprise.
- What?
- You know.
- No, I don't. What?
- Where is she? Did she miss tea again?
- She said she had tummy ache.
- So, she's sulking in her room?
- It's her age.
- She's a pest.
So were you once. 
Now, go and wake her.
Pest! Pest!
- I want you to have a word with her.
- I have tried. I've been upstairs to see her.
But she tells me that I don't understand.
- Oh, that's ridiculous.
- Well, she's right.
Go away!
They want you downstairs.
You have to come out sometime.
You can't sulk in there for ever.
Open the door!
Open it.
You've been at my lipstick, too, haven't you?
Pest!
What makes you so different, anyway?
Buck teeth!
Come on out, pest. It's not because I want you, either. It's because Mummy wants you.
Pest, pest, pest.
Pest, pest, pest.
Say goodbye to your sister, now, so you never forget her.
Stay with me, child.
Chew on this. 
It'll keep your mind off things.
"Man, that is born of a woman, hath but a short time to live,
and is full of misery.
He cometh up, and is cut down, like a flower;
he fleeth as it were a shadow, and never continueth in one stay.
In the midst of life we are in death."
Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God, in his great mercy,
to take unto himself the soul of our dear sister here departed, we therefore commit her body to the ground;
earth to earth, ashes to ashes...
dust to dust.
Your only sister, all alone in the wood, and nobody there to save her.
Poor little lamb.
Why couldn't she save herself?
You don't know anything. 
You're only a child.
- Daddy!
- There, there, pet.
Shall I take her home with me tonight?
Her mother's in no fit state to look after her.
- If only you would.
- Come, pet.
- I want to stay with Mummy.
- Mummy's not well. Just for tonight.
Come, child. Come with me.
It's a long way through the wood, but safe by daylight.
Safe, if you keep to the path...
There's plenty more of these in the woods... if you know where to look.
Berries!
Don't stray from the path, girl.
Did you not hear what I told you?
Once you stray from the path, you're lost entirely.
The wild beasts know no mercy.
They wait for us in the wood, in the shadow, and once you put a foot wrong, they pounce.
There, there, girl. 
Don't take on so.
It's something you have to learn. Otherwise, you'll end up like your poor, dear sister.
Gran, can I have one?
I don't see why not.
You've got a lot to learn, child.
Oh! Never stray from the path, never eat a windfall apple, and never trust a man whose eyebrows meet.
The best winter wool, pet, woven across the valley.
It was so good, so soft,
I thought I'd knit a shawl for your sister.
But now... you know what I'll do?
- What, Gran?
- I'll make one for you.
A very special shawl, for a very special lady.
Soft as a kitten.
There's something I should tell you.
Yes?
- But maybe you're too young.
- Tell me, Gran.
- Too young to understand.
- Oh, go on, Gran. Tell me.
Maybe no child is ever too young.
A wolf may be more than he seems.
He may come in many disguises.
What's that?
The wolf that ate your sister was hairy on the outside, but when she died, she went straight to heaven.
The worst kind of wolves are hairy on the inside, and when they bite you, they drag you with them to hell.
What do you mean, hairy on the inside?
Like a furry coat?
Hush, now, foolish child. 
Listen.
Once upon a time, there was a woman in the village... and she married a traveling man.
They've all gone now.
It's a shame your people missed the wedding.
Maybe it is, and... maybe it isn't.
My little brother's idea of a joke!
Oh!
Why are you staring like that?
Because I've never seen anything like you before.
Don't they have girls where you come from?
None like you.
Come out of the shadows.
Let me see you, my love.
Are all traveling men as handsome as you?
So, you think I'm handsome?
The first thing I noticed about you... was the way your eyebrows meet.
Doesn't it spoil me, then?
Come to me, and I'll tell you.
My dear?
I must just go out into the yard for a moment.
Why ever for?
Call of nature.
So, she waited.
And she waited.
And she waited again.
Surely, he's been gone a long time?
No, it can't be!
Wolves, indeed!
He upped and ran-- that's all.
It was in his blood.
Yeah. Wasn't he a traveling man?
Anything?
Not a hair nor a hide of him. 
Not a footprint.
And what's that, might I ask?
I told you I heard the wolves last night.
They came and took him when he was making water, when a man is at his most defenseless!
The murderers! The murderers!
But she was a young thing.
And cheerful of temperament.
And she found another husband, not too shy to piss in a pot.
And then they lived happily ever after?
Indeed, they did not.
But at first, time passed happily enough.
What a mess!
Oh, don't start!
Shut up!
Here...
Time passed, and she gave him children.
And that was a bad time for wolves, those years.
Oh, yes.
 Not a sheep or a cow was safe.
But for herself, all went right as a trivet...
until...
one winter's night.
My God...
I'm starving.
- Do you want something to eat?
- Didn't you hear me the first time?
Where did these three spring from?
Out of my belly.
Your children, but not my children.
Whore!
Adulteress! 
You hoped I'd never come back!
- I thought the wolves had taken you!
- Better wolf than whore.
If I were a wolf once more,
I'd teach this whore a lesson!
No! No!
He looks just the same... as the day I married him.
I'd never let a man strike me.
They're nice as pie until they've had their way with you.
But once the bloom is gone, oh, the beast comes out.
When the wolves, though, the real wolves... when the real wolves mate, do the dogs beat the bitches afterwards?
Animals. 
All wild animals.
Well, that's enough wool for tonight.
Bedtime.
What about a kiss for Granny?
Don't I deserve a kiss... for my story?
The best of all girls!
Learn how to sew, how to take care of things, how to press things.
There isn't anything in the house that you won't be able to do.
Learn how to be useful.
Useful.
I'm sure you'll find it will almost certainly turn out to be a toadstool, and make you deathly ill.
Of course, you won't stay a young girl much longer.
Your mummy and daddy will need all the help they can get.
You must grow wise and learn all you can, now that your sister has gone.
Wolfie, wolfie, you can't catch me
I've got a wife and a family...
- Wolfie, wolfie...
- Caught!
- Caught who, you snotty-nosed ragamuffin?
- Caught Rosaleen.
Oh, nobody catches my little princess.
Come along, child.
Run, quickly, over here!
There's too much food now there's just the three of us.
Don't grieve.
Least said, soonest mended.
Rosaleen!
- Shall we play now?
- Play what?
A game.
I know a good game. 
Close your eyes.
Now, come to me.
Closer.
Closer. Come on.
Come closer.
There.
Now what?
Can't catch me!
- Mummy...
- Yes, pet?
- Does he hurt you?
- Does who hurt me?
Does Daddy hurt you, when he...
No, not at all.
- It sounds like...
- Like what?
Like the beasts Granny talked about.
You pay too much attention to your granny.
She knows a lot, but she doesn't know everything.
And if there's a beast in men, it meets its match in women, too.
Do you understand me?
Get up and fetch me some water.
- Rosaleen...
- Yes?
I've got you a little present.
What kind of present?
I thought maybe you'd take a walk with me in the woods.
On Sunday after the service.
Just a little walk, Rosaleen.
Why should I?
I thought maybe you'd want to.
- I'll have to ask.
- But tell your mother I'll be with you.
And we won't stray from the path.
They're the best of all roses, fit for the grave of a princess.
They came off my best rose tree.
Why can't Mummy grow roses like that?
Well, it's a question of a green thumb.
She lacks that.
No hand at pastry, either.
- Good morning, Father.
- Good morning.
They say the priests' bastards often turn into wolves as they grow older.
What do you mean?
If the child is born on Christmas Day, if he's born feet first, he'll be the one.
If he's born feet first, and his eyebrows meet in the middle.
Oh, yes.
Very bad.
One day, he'll meet the Devil in the wood.
Now, use it wisely.
Waste not, want not.
No! No! No!
No! No! No!
That's a horrid story. 
I didn't like it at all.
It's not a story, child. 
It's the God's own truth.
So, if you should spy on a naked man in the wood, run as if the Devil himself were after you.
The Devil's one thing, but a priest making babies is another.
I don't think our priest would have it in him.
Well, you can't trust anyone, least of all a priest. He's not called Father for nothing.
And don't bother to whisper. 
He's deaf as a post.
There. 
Isn't that lovely?
All we need is a nice border and fringe.
See how soft it feels.
Soft as snow.
- Red as a berry.
- Red as blood.
Does the old fool want to brain me?
What's he up to in the tree, the old monkey?
Father, Father, are you climbing up to heaven and chopping the rungs of the ladder after you?
Watch what you're doing. 
Can you hear me?
Don't make so much clamor in the garden of God's house, you irreverent woman. I heard every word.
- Watch your silly game!
- Someone's got to do it.
Someone's got to cut away the old wood.
Even evergreens need pruning.
Daddy, leave her be.
He only asked me to walk with him.
What's wrong with that?
- All the same, I don't know...
- Oh, what's the harm in it?
He's our neighbor. She's known him since she was a baby. She still is a baby.
- So was our Alice once.
- Oh, she'll be gone soon. She's so pretty.
What is it they say?
"It's not losing a daughter; it's gaining a son."
Stop teasing me.
He only asked me to walk with him.
Well, one thing leads to another.
Isaiah, Chapter 11, Verses 6 to 8.
"The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb,
and the leopard shall lie down with the kid...
and the calf and the young lion and fatling together,
and a little child shall lead them.
And the cow and the bear shall feed.
Their young ones shall lie down together... and the lion shall eat straw, like the ox.
And the suckling child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den.
They shall not hurt, nor destroy, in all my holy mountain;
for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord... as the waters cover the sea."
- I do think she's pretty.
- Yes.
That's my boy!
Don't stray from the path.
- When do you have to be back, Rosaleen?
- Soon.
Why are you so crabby today?
I thought you wanted to come.
And what if I did?
Well, you should...
What should I?
You know.
I don't know.
Look.
It's pretty, but not as pretty as you.
- Wasn't that nice?
- No.
What's wrong, Rosaleen?
Don't you like me?
Oh, no, I like you.
I like you well enough.
Well, why won't you kiss me?
- You're afraid, aren't you?
- I'm not afraid.
Well?
That wasn't very good. 
Give me another.
You'll have to catch me first.
Rosaleen?
Rosaleen?
Rosaleen?
Rosaleen?
Rosaleen?
Where are you?
Oh, Jesus!
Wolf! Wolf!
Wolf! Wolf! Wolf!
Wolf!
Where's my daughter? 
What have you done?
- She ran away from me!
- Where's my daughter?
- Where's Rosaleen?
- Get your hands off him!
- Don't you hit my boy!
- You pig!
Your son left my only daughter to the mercy of the wolves!
A daughter's one thing; a heifer's another.
Stop it! Stop it!
I'll cool you off!
My darling, where have you been?
You're in such a state.
Look, Mummy.
Take care, won't you? 
And take this.
No. This is all these beasts understand.
Kill them before they kill you. 
That's the way.
Keep close.
Keep close.
There was once a village so plagued with the beasts, that they drew one up in the bucket of the well.
Hush your antique gossip, unless you want the wolves to hear it.
We're nearly there.
You're such a big girl now, aren't you?
Come on. Hold still.
There you are, big girl. Be careful with those boys or they'll take you in the woods again.
What boys?
Clowns are what the village boys are.
Your granny spoils you.
She makes you think you're something special.
That red shawl!
You think wolves are big now?
You should have seen 'em when I were a lad.
Monsters, they was. 
That's the truth.
Veritable monsters. 
Big as a man.
Bigger.
When will Daddy have done with the killing?
When the beast is dead, and not until the beast is dead.
We won't live quiet until then.
Be winter soon.
A hard winter.
A hard winter brings out the wolf.
Thank God we're safe indoors.
We must hide in the trees!
Settle that duck, boy. 
Quickly.
Douse the lights!
Into the trees.
Come on. Quickly.
Quickly, boy. 
Quickly.
Over here. Over here.
Come on!
Come on!
Granny says wolves might not always be what they seem.
How can a wolf be worse than it already is?
Not worse, but different.
Maybe it isn't the wolf's fault, Mummy.
Maybe...
Maybe what?
Maybe, once upon a time...
Are you going to tell me a story?
Maybe I am.
Go on, then.
Once upon a time... there was a woman in the valley.
Mmm?
And the son of the big house did her a terrible wrong.
Ohh.
So, she came to his wedding, to put wrong to right.
My dear, she was a beautiful lady.
No-one would have suspected a thing.
This is the happiest day of my life.
Shall we, my dear?
Ladies and gentlemen... a toast.
To the bride and groom.
- To the bride and groom.
- To the bride and groom.
- Come on, lad. Kiss the girl!
- Go on, my dear.
- Come on.
- It would be a pleasure!
Come, my dear.
A taste of what's to come.
What? Er... sorry. 
Nothing, my dear.
Well done, sir. 
Very good.
Your every happiness, my dear.
So, I wasn't good enough for you?
I was once.
Once upon a time.
Don't you remember?
Well, don't you?
The wolves in the forest are more decent.
What's going on?
Where did you hear a story like that?
Not a story, but God's honest truth.
Granny told me.
And after that, the woman made the wolves come to sing to her and the baby at night.
Made them come and serenade her.
But what pleasure would there be in that-- listening to a lot of wolves?
Don't we have to do it all the time?
The pleasure would come... from knowing the power that she had.
Dad, it's a wolf!
Got you, you hound of hell!
Praise be to God!
When I cut it off the carcass for a trophy, it was a forepaw.
The forepaw of the biggest wolf I ever saw.
The wolf that killed our Alice?
Aye, maybe.
When I cut it with a knife, it was a forepaw-- I swear!
A grizzled, giant wolf.
And then, before my very eyes...
Whose is it, Daddy? 
Is it someone you knew?
What do I know whose hand it is?
All I know is what I see.
Get it out.
Was it a wolf or a man you killed?
When I killed it, it was a wolf.
It turned into a man.
Seeing is believing.
Is it? 
What about touching?
Get it out!
Whatever it is... now it's dead meat.
Do we bury it or burn it, Daddy?
You're besotted with that old lady-- her and her old wives' tales.
Maybe you shouldn't go.
Daddy killed the great wolf.
I'll be safe in the forest now.
Mind you don't stray, and take something to protect yourself.
How about a knife?
You're not afraid of anything, are you?
You're a fearless child-- I'll say that.
I suppose your granny will ask you to stay the night. You always were her favorite.
Of course I'll stay the night, if she asks me.
It would be rude not to. She is my grandmother.
And she may not have a kind word for you, but she's always been good to me.
She's all alone out there, Mummy.
Maybe you're right and maybe you're not.
Give her that from me.
And don't stray, now, Rosaleen.
I trust you. You won't be lucky twice.
I promise.
Rosaleen!
- Where are you going?
- Off to see my granny.
It's a long way through the woods.
Let me come with you. You'll be safe with me.
Go into the woods with you?
After what happened last time?
Let me come. 
I'll protect you.
No. I've got this to protect me.
Miss.
Where did you spring from?
Did I scare you? I am sorry.
At least you've got your clothes on.
Huntsman, are you? 
Lost your horse?
Lost my horse and lost my companions, young lady.
And lost your way, too.
I do believe I just found it.
I say, do you think you could spare me a drink out of that?
Well, I would, but it's for my granny.
I know the very place, up the way, for a picnic.
I have the most remarkable object in my pocket.
That means I'll never lose my way in the wood.
In your pocket, you say?
This object goes everywhere with me.
Whenever, that is, I wear my trousers.
Go on. Bite it.
Don't you know how strong that stuff is?
A man in our village keeps a still.
He has the reddest nose you ever saw.
He tells lies, too.
Like you.
I don't believe there is such a thing.
Seeing is believing.
The little needle always points north, no matter where I go, so I always know exactly where I am.
I don't believe it, even though I see it.
It was this compass that brought me safe through the wood.
But you lost your way in the wood.
But... I found you.
- Are you sorry?
- No. I'm not sorry.
They're clowns, the village boys.
- Well, then...
- But you should never leave the path.
I've only just got onto the path.
I was perfectly safe before.
Aren't you afraid of the wolves?
Why should I be frightened of the wolves?
You must know the worst wolves are hairy on the inside.
Old wives' tales! 
Peasant superstition.
What? A bright, young girl-- pretty, intelligent girl like you-- believing in werewolves!
But my granny said that...
For believing in old wives' tales... you... deserve... to be... punished!
I'll show you I'm not afraid of the wolves, Rosaleen.
I'll make a bet with you.
I'll bet you anything you like that I get to your granny's house before you do.
How?
Because I'll use my compass to help me across the country, while you trudge along the dreary path.
Bet me your compass.
Bet you... your heart's desire.
And if I lose?
You can... give me... a kiss.
Here. Take my hat as a token of goodwill.
Wear it until we meet again.
- Who is it?
- Only your granddaughter.
Lift up the latch and walk in.
God save us!
Get thee back to hell from whence you came!
I don't come from hell. 
I came from the forest.
- What did you do with my granddaughter?
- Nothing she didn't want.
Who's there?
- Only your granddaughter.
- Lift up the latch and walk in.
So, you got here before me.
Just as you said you would.
I did.
Where's my granny?
Gone out to the woodpile to fetch more logs.
A real gentleman would never let an old lady go out, not on a night like this.
She won't be long.
She's not there.
Is that all you left of her?
Your kind can't stomach hair, can you?
Even if the worst wolves are hairy on the inside.
- What do you know about my kind?
- My granny told me plenty!
Are you very much afraid?
It wouldn't do me much good to be afraid, would it?
- What big eyes you have!
- All the better to see you with.
They say seeing is believing, but I'd never swear to it.
You must be wet through.
Won't you take off your shawl?
Uh-uh.
- What shall I do with it?
- Into the fire. You won't need it again.
Your kind can't stomach clothes, either.
Who's come to sing us carols, then?
Only my companions, darling.
I love the company of wolves.
Look out of the window, and you'll see them.
Poor creatures.
It's freezing cold out there.
No wonder they howl so.
- What? Are you sorry for them?
- Yes, and for you, too.
You're a bold, fearless girl, aren't you?
And now you must give me back my gun, my dear.
Are you our kind or their kind?
Not one nor the other. Both.
Then where do you live? 
In our world or theirs?
I come and go between them.
My home is nowhere.
Are you only a man when you dress like one?
Like Granny said?
My, what big arms you have!
All the better to hug you with.
Well...
Perhaps.
You did win your bet, didn't you?
You're a gentleman. 
You're a fine gentleman.
They say the Prince of Darkness is a gentleman,
and, as it turns out, they're right.
A fine gentleman.
Gentlemen always keep their promises.
Do ladies keep their promises, too?
What do you mean?
Indeed, I won my bet, so now... you owe me...
I remember.
A kiss.
Will you be honorable and pay me?
Or... will you not?
Jesus! What big teeth you have!
All the better to eat you with.
I'm sorry.
I never knew a wolf could cry.
Leaving you, are they? 
You'll be all alone.
I'll tell you a story of a wounded wolf.
Once upon a time, when the village was asleep...
a she-wolf came from the world below...
to the world above.
She meant no harm to anyone.
But someone meant harm to her.
So, she ran, and she ran...
and she ran again.
Who's there?
Who's there?
This is holy ground.
Can you speak, my child?
Are you God's work or the Devil's?
Oh, what do I care whose work you are?
You poor, speechless creature.
It will heal in time.
And the wound did heal,
for she was just a girl, after all,
who had strayed from the path in the forest,
and remembered what she'd found there.
So, back through the forest...
she ran and ran...
to the well and the village...
from whence she came.
She crept inside...
to the world below.
And that's all I'll tell you... because that's all I know.
Rosaleen!
Rosaleen!
Rosaleen!
No!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Rosaleen!
"Little girls, this seems to say,
never stop upon your way.
Never trust a stranger friend.
No-one knows how it will end.
As you're pretty, so be wise.
Wolves may lurk in every guise.
Now, as then, 'tis simple truth.
Sweetest tongue has sharpest tooth."
Hey, Bud! Get up!
Pete, can't get through.
That's funny.
It seems pretty clear over here.
Tanker Base.
Tanker Base, this is Fire Boss. Over.
WOMAN: Go ahead, Boss.
FIRE BOSS: We've got a situation here.
Sector K, that's for,
"Kwick, we're kooking."
WOMAN: Cavalry coming up inside four minutes.
Tanker 57 to Fire Boss.
Make that one minute.
Peter St. Peter, don't do this to me. How much fuel you got left?
I love it in the kitchen, baby. You know that.
Peter St. Peter, you've got that Evel Knievel sound in your voice I hate.
I want to blow out this one tree, funny face...
...and make a wish for your birthday.
You want to keep flying, land that plane.
Do what the lady says.
In the trees...
Obscuring...
Excuse me, I didn't quite catch that.
Take over, Frank.
Yeah.
Tanker 57 to Tanker Base.
I've got a small inconvenience here.
Talk to me, Pete.
I may have overestimated my fuel just a tad.
I see the base and my right engine is fine, so there shouldn't be any...
...problem.
What do you need?
What do you need?
Glider practice.
FRANK: (OVER MEGAPHONE)
We've got a situation.
Flier coming in, dead stick.
This is good.
I was rusty on panic.
No problem. I've got the airport in sight.
A nice little headwind.
(PETE WHISTLING
OVER MEGAPHONE)
Up and over.
Come on, Mama.
Up and over. Up and over.
(WHISPERING) Please, please.
Come on, Mama, we're too cute to die.
(BIRTHDAY MUSIC PLAYING
ON MEGAPHONE)
Up!
There he is!
Okay.
Happy birthday.
I'm taking a plane.
Why?
This time he's really done it.
Done what?
Oh, Christ.
Happy birthday to you...
Take off!
You don't even understand how I feel!
This time I'm going to show him.
Excuse me, Willy.
You magnificent pagan god!
PETE: Thanks, Al.
What gives?
She's showing you.
She's a great girl.
She's great.
Showing me what?
I didn't know it was her birthday.
It's because you don't love her like I do.
Where did you get that oil on your face? Where?
It's here. Look.
It's terrible.
Thanks.
What do you mean,
"showing me"?
I don't like her flying that. Now you're getting it.
You're mad at me.
I can tell.
It's okay. I'm just moody.
Beautiful day.
Yes, it is.
How was my landing?
Nearly perfect.
Wow! Thanks.
You only fly like that when I'm watching.
I always come in on three wheels.
Perverse, aren't you?
Don't do that, Dorinda.
Can she take the Wiley scrapper? The Wiley vet?
Who knows?
There's a quick left. Look out.
Level off when you come in.
Don't tell me what to do.
What did I say?
You got something in your teeth.
(CHUCKLES) I ain't falling for that.
You caught some heat coming in.
You know women.
I mean your plane.
I might have to kill you for that remark.
Every time you come in, the fire trucks come out.
Nails, go play golf.
It's my plane.
You've got something between your teeth.
What makes you think
I forgot your birthday?
Why do you do this?
Want to dance?
There's a dance tonight.
Coming through.
Please, take mine.
This is for you.
You're incredible.
You think you can buy me off with some crummy present you got in an airport gift shop.
It's worked before.
I don't want it.
Take it.
Fathead.
"Fathead"?
Yeah.
I don't want it.
Yes, you do.
I don't.
You do.
You do. You really do.
You really don't?
No.
Oh, Pete.
Girl clothes!
Get back!
Don't touch that!
Why didn't you tell me before I lost my temper?
So you do like dresses.
It's not the dress.
It's the way you see me.
Know what this place reminds me of?
I'll bet you a beer you're going to tell me.
You lose.
Love! It ain't what it used to be.
There have only ever been two kinds.
Flash fires, which are all flame, burn themselves out and leave nothing.
Then there is the long burning. That is nature's burn.
Even when you think it's out...
...the forest floor is warm to the touch.
That's what you and Dorinda have got.
You're a poet, Al.
You're a really bad poet, but you're a poet.
To hell with it.
This place reminds me of World War II.
This is deep.
I wasn't in it, but think about it.
The beer is warm, the hall is a Quonset...
...there are B-26s outside, hotshot pilots inside. Airstrip in the woods.
It's England!
Everything but Glenn Miller.
Except we bomb places that are already burning.
You see, Pete, there ain't no war here.
What's taking her so long?
That's why they don't make movies called,
Night Raid to Boise,
Idaho or...
...Firemen Strike at Dawn.
And this is why you're not exactly a hero for taking the chances you take.
You're more of what I would call a dickhead.
Is this heading somewhere?
Here's my point.
I'm talking to this guy.
He tells me about this tanker school in Flat Rock, Colorado.
A school for fire pilots.
There are no forest fires in Flat Rock, Colorado, because there are no trees.
That is why they call it Flat Rock, you dunce.
I think they know this, Pete.
That's why they chose Flat Rock.
So they could start a few little fires without burning down all of Colorado.
The idea...
...is to teach guys to do drops and set up test areas to teach pilots who want to get their
Initial Attack cards.
Are you following this?
Yeah. Yeah.
They're looking for a great teacher, like a commanding officer.
An experienced guy who might be looking for a change of pace.
Year-round employment, great paycheck. Are you with me?
I'm way ahead of you.
It's not a bad notion.
I'm glad you see it like this.
It's a terrific idea.
You'd be perfect for it.
Me? I'm not talking about me.
I don't need a day job.
I'm very happy...
Gosh.
Beer, please.
In a champagne glass.
Make it two.
Let me make something clear.
If you think you can make me weak in the knees by giving me girl clothes, you're as out-of-date as your airplane. You know?
I know.
I'm not weak in the knees.
I'm weak in the head.
You're beautiful.
I love you.
I know.
So tell me you love me.
Please, please.
Tell me, tell me.
Tell me, tell me!
In front of all these people?
You mean Carl?
Le Budweiser.
The '89.
BOTH: Thanks, Carl.
To us.
Always.
(EXHALES) Hmm.
St. Louis. Southside.
You never laugh at my jokes.
What jokes?
Left rudder. Left.
I know, I know.
It's too bad we don't have a song.
You know, when couples say, "Honey, they're playing our song."
I can't believe you forgot.
What, we have a song?
Yes, we have a song.
You big lug!
You'll break my heart.
You're calling me a "big lug"?
Let's try that signaling to the band bit.
It works in the movies.
Guys, hit it.
They
Asked me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied
Something here inside
Cannot be denied
You laugh like a donkey.
I do not.
Do, too.
I don't do that.
Do you know him?
Never saw him before.
You smiled at a poor defenseless guy.
Yes, I think I did.
That was a damn-fool thing to do.
Why, darling?
You are giving smiles away now?
I'm feeling very fine.
Are you sure you're not feeling feverish?
I'm all right as long as we keep dancing.
Happy birthday.
It's not my birthday.
It isn't?
No.
I forgot your birthday again?
No, you just remembered it wrong.
My turn, flyboy.
Hi, Donnie. (CHUCKLES)
You look like an angel.
Let's go start ourselves a little fire.
Airborne, cutting in.
Stand in the door.
Whoa! Time out now.
Nobody dances with this dress until they wash their hands.
Miss Scarlett?
Oh, boys.
You want to dance with my girl, you've got to wipe your hands.
That's it. Whoa!
That's not a towel.
That's good. Very good.
You missed a spot.
Oh, God!
Is that your plane?
Yes, that is mine.
Come on. A shortcut.
Pete?
Hmm?
Haircut.
What?
You want me to get a haircut today?
Cat food.
Green apples.
You're shopping in your sleep again.
Chicken wings.
Tempura batter.
What is for dinner?
Toilet paper. Soap.
And dessert?
Kitty litter.
Q-tips.
Socks.
(WHISPERS) Pete?
What?
You have a bad dream?
It's cold.
Come on.
I'm watching the fire.
We don't do fires at night.
We do fires in the day.
At night, we eat, drink and be mad for each other.
Mmm. Sounds like an all right life.
I like it.
I thought I might try it.
Try what?
Tankers.
I'd like to get type-rated for air tankers.
Then we'd both be up there instead of one of us on the ground and the other...
Forget it.
I could make it in a year.
With three years of hauling freight, I've done 1,000 hours.
I saw the last four minutes. Forget it.
It's none of your beeswax.
It is my beeswax and
I won't let you do it.
How will you stop me?
By telling you "no."
By asking you nicely.
Dorinda, honey, please.
Don't be a pigheaded fool.
That is irresistible.
Now you listen to me for a change.
I'll make you a deal.
Here's your chance to get me out of the air.
I'll ground myself in Flat Rock and be your girl.
Have you been talking to Al?
Or...
...I head off on my own and tonight is goodbye.
I'll find my own piece of sky and a guy who flies sensible.
I fly sensible.
Not when something is on fire.
That is the deal.
Then it is no deal.
Let's change the subject.
What's going on?
Why are you doing this?
Because...
Because why? Why?
Because...
Why are you doing this?
Because I love you.
Fighting fires is what
I do and it is what I love, and you know that!
What the hell is going on that you want me to quit?
You want me to move to Colorado and teach pretend fires to trainees like I'm going to an office?
Pete.
Your number is up.
When my number is up...
...it is up.
Right?
I could just as soon buy it ferrying Bibles to Salt Lake City.
When it is your turn,
I don't want to be around.
I think that is very selfish of you.
You should be at the funeral, crying and looking terrific before you enter the nunnery.
You wish!
I'll have better things to do and better men to do them with.
Forget about these other men, Dorinda.
You'll never be with another man.
I will, too, and he'll be tall.
No, Dorinda.
Why not?
You'll never get over me.
Don't kid yourself.
No one will ever be as much fun.
Fun?
You think I have fun when you have fun?
When you fly into some narrow canyon, you think I'm on the ground going, "Boy, this is fun"?
I could understand how you fly if you were risking yourself for civilization.
If you were...
...putting your life on the line for another life, anybody's life.
I love you, Pete.
But I'm not enjoying it.
(SNIFFLES) Every time you take off,
I wait for the phone to ring.
I go to bed sick and I get up scared.
I don't like being sick inside all the time.
Do think I like being afraid that you won't come back?
Okay. Okay.
Look... (SIGHS)
...I have an idea.
Bear with me a second.
Okay.
Keep an open mind, because it is a pretty radical idea.
Al told me about a training school in Flat Rock, Colorado.
They need a commanding officer and I was wondering, why don't I take you to Colorado and you could be my girl and I could teach those geeks to fight fires.
You know, till they could put out a cigar at 200 feet and I'd come home every night and we'd have an apartment with a microwave oven.
Don't answer it.
I won't.
It's not my phone.
Hi, Al.
No.
No, because it is my day off.
Get yourself another pilot.
I'm hanging up my spurs.
That's right. (CHUCKLES)
Yes, she's a great girl, isn't she?
Okay.
Al is on his way over.
It's your lay-off day.
There is a new burn in the south rim.
There are already two pilots down. (SIGHS)
Down?
Sick.
What you got?
We've got nine hot spots.
We're only taking care of three of them.
I love you!
You can't leave without knowing that.
I know you do and you know I do.
How would I know that?
You never say the words!
These days we've had, last night. These things are fragile!
What? We got a lot of things settled last night.
Shut up!
Kiss me and fly!
Dorinda, I love you!
I love...
I love you! (CHUCKLES)
Al the Pal, this is Pete
St. Pete. Over.
This is Al the Pal.
I've got you loud and proud.
This is Fire Boss, over.
AL: This is Al the Pal.
Roger, Al.
Go for the leading edge of the fire.
You got it.
PETE: Two minutes behind him, Boss.
Good enough, good buddy.
Get down!
Save some fire for me.
There is plenty of fire for everybody.
Watch his next pass and build on that.
Oh! Bad strike!
Al, pull up.
Goddamn it, I thought that was it, man!
Oh, shit.
Al! What happened?
PETE: Talk to me.
My engine is on fire!
Can you believe that?
And I was in such a good mood.
You think you can make it back?
It ain't happening!
The fire will hit the fuel tank any second! Damn!
Use your extinguisher.
Already did.
I'm screwed.
Pete, lighten up or you won't pull out of that dive!
Pete, this ain't a dogfight, man!
BOSS: Pete, this is the boss!
That dive is way too steep!
Pull out of there!
You're too heavy!
Get out of there!
Now!
Baby, you're the greatest!
Come on.
Get up!
Come on, Pete, pull up.
Come on, man.
Get up!
Oh, yes! He made it!
That lucky son of a bitch.
Hello, Pete.
Hello.
Hap.
Hello, Hap.
That was quite a show back there.
Yes, ma'am.
Take a seat.
Okay. Thanks.
I sure saved Al's bacon, all right. (LAUGHING)
Too bad about my port engine.
My fuel tank went up like...
Just a minute.
Comfy around the neck?
Yeah. Yeah, it's fine.
Listen, how did I get out of that one?
You didn't.
I didn't?
Mmm-mmm.
My plane blew up.
I remember that.
A real fireball.
Now I'm sitting in the woods, getting my hair cut.
Either I'm dead or I'm crazy.
You're not crazy, Pete.
Hap.
Don't think
I'm doubting your good faith.
I just want to get something clear.
Okay?
Okay.
Okay.
I'm dead?
That's right.
I'm dead?
Right.
Keep the sideburns.
(SIGHS) What a jerk
I turned out to be.
Dead. (SCOFFS)
What do you think of that?
Dorinda.
She's still not over it.
I hope not. I've only been dead 20 minutes.
Yes and no.
Down there they think it's six months.
Time is funny stuff.
A lot funnier than
Einstein ever figured out.
Yeah?
How did he take it?
That'll do it.
Where was I?
"Time is funny stuff."
Yes. That was it.
Space has its points, too.
So in the five months since you crashed...
You said it was six months.
That was then.
I'm explaining this to you in the wrong order.
Hey, look!
PETE: I did my first solo in one of those!
HAP: That's right.
I did that!
That's right.
Boy, was I nervous!
But you want to know a funny thing?
Once I got up there,
I felt like a veteran.
I couldn't do anything wrong.
I flew that plane like Fats Waller flies his piano.
I circled the field, then I found a perfect sideslip in the wind and I came in just like a leaf.
That's right.
You think you did that by yourself?
There was nobody else up there with me.
There was, Pete.
There was?
There was someone like you.
Behind him was someone else.
Maybe someone who learned what he learned on a motorized box kite.
And you knew that, though you had a different word for it.
I did? What word?
It's what fliers and piano players and everyone else count on.
They reach for it. They pray for it.
And often, just when they need it most, they get it.
It's breathed into them.
It's what the word means.
Spiritus.
The divine breath.
Inspiration.
Inspiration.
And now it's your turn to give it back.
That's how the whole thing works.
That's how the whole thing works.
So now I'm supposed to give inspiration to some flyer?
Yes, but you're not going back as a flying instructor.
That's only part of it.
How does this work if I'm...
They hear you inside their own minds, as if it were their thoughts. Clever?
Clever.
But remember, Pete.
You've had your life, for better or for worse.
Anything you do for yourself now is a waste of spirit.
There's your boy.
Hi.
Hey, Rachel.
Hi, buddy.
Why are you so happy?
I think you're a pretty silly-looking guy. What do you think of that?
It has a mind of its own.
A glitch in the transmission.
Are you Baker?
Yeah.
The boss wants to see you.
Thanks. Where?
To the right of where it says, "Women."
Green door.
Thanks.
I'm the "Women."
First thing you have to know is what type of plane you're flying.
That determines how many drops you can make.
In our example, we have an eight-door aircraft...
Looking for the training school? Yes.
See the base commander next door.
Al, you son of a bitch, you!
Jeez, you look great!
I mean, you look terrible in the same old great way.
Honor to meet you, sir. Ted Baker.
Sorry I'm late.
Did you get lost?
Yes, I did.
How did you know?
It says here you got your ticket back after a 12-month suspension.
While they looked into why you flew 500 kitchen units...
There's a crawly thing on your face.
Don't you want to scratch your cheek? Its legs are tickling you.
You mixed up Burbank with Van Nuys.
Lymers.
It's a little Lyme tick.
My directional gyro wasn't working.
They're burrowing in.
They're laying eggs.
You also violated military air space.
Try this.
It'll feel good.
There you go.
I'm going to like this job.
Sir, you have a smudge on your face.
Here?
The other side.
Right there.
Another comedian.
I'm not a comedian.
You better not be.
I feel so alive!
Let me light that for you.
It's okay.
Probably a cross wind over the trash can.
Kid, I think we're both making a big mistake.
Why don't you try again with Wing 'N' Prayer?
That was an air delivery service. I was ahead of my time.
You're that guy!
That's why I'm here.
I've never seen an operation like this before. I like the smell of it.
The smoke?
That, too.
I knew that was what I wanted to do.
I don't know.
Give him a chance!
Okay, you've got a chance.
Don't screw it up.
Thank you, sir.
Look at that bum.
He thinks he is on vacation.
AL: Go.
Go.
Tune it. Tune it.
Beautiful.
C-119 Transport, this is Al the Pal.
Let the games begin.
Right on.
Looking good.
Pitiful.
It's a little premature.
Bring it in, Powerhouse.
That's it. Beautiful.
Bring that fat bomber in here.
Drop! Drop!
I'm glad we're not at war.
Ted Baker, show time.
Hit it.
Bad line, Ted.
Bad line!
If you don't straighten out, you'll dump all over Al.
Great line, Ted.
Aim for the flag that looks like an umbrella.
I'm sorry, Hap,
I can't help it. What the hell?
Oh, my God!
Nuts.
Whoa!
You'll find your fortune falling
All over town
Is this first place?
You must have showers
Cute.
Now we know how ready you are.
Fire season will be here soon.
If we get a real big one, they'll be calling guys from all over. They'll be...
...calling veterans, first-timers, guys from all over the country.
When they call me and say, "What've you got?"
I'll tell them
I've got nothing because you're nothing.
What you did today was nothing.
You can't hit a smoking oil drum and a drum ain't a tree!
A tree can explode like a bomb!
It can go up like a Roman candle.
An oil drum has no heat.
In a real fire, there is heat.
There's heat that can suck you under, flip you over.
There are currents that tie knots in a windsock. And, Baker...
You're on the bus.
When I get back from
San Diego tomorrow, I want you gone.
Come on, Al.
I didn't say anything.
Good.
It wasn't his fault.
Tell him it wasn't your fault.
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Don't quit.
I didn't come back to inspire a quitter.
He'll cool off once his color is normal.
Party's over for me.
Forget that. This is your farewell party.
Saddle up.
We're going to hit the bright lights.
I think she likes you.
Oh, Ted.
I met the most important girl of my life in a bar like this.
It's true.
I took one look at her and I said, "This is it."
I went up to her and
I looked in her eyes, and I said,
"You are the reason that I am here."
What'll it be?
Vodka martini.
Don't forget the olive.
Root beer.
Don't forget the olive.
Hello, Ted.
We'll miss you.
"You're the reason
I'm here."
Can I buy you a drink?
Sure.
Bartender.
Diet Pepsi.
With or without the olive?
With or without...
I think without.
Thank you.
Dance with her.
She wants to dance with you.
Don't you have any impulses?
Dance?
Sure, I'd love to.
Love to what?
Did you say "dance"?
Did I? I can't dance.
Talking is nice.
I'm not a good talker either.
This is nice.
It is?
Don't you think so?
Rachel?
Do you think it's possible to see a girl and know right off that she is it?
I think it's possible.
This is hard to talk about.
Try.
It's happened to me.
I think you're overdoing this.
It has?
It was last summer.
I only saw her once.
I wish you could have met her.
It's like reading a book, and after the first page, you know how it will turn out. It was like that.
That's why I'm here.
It feels good to tell somebody that. Thank you.
Well, I think I'll just...
...come in again.
Rachel, what about your drink? He's bringing your drink.
I don't think I've ever come across this particular technique before.
First approach, this is Cessna Skymaster 5-2-1-0 Kilo.
Roger, 1-0 Kilo.
DORINDA: Squawk 0-2-4-7, maintain 5,500.
Say again.
1-0 Kilo...
Dorinda?
Honey bunny?
You little quarter-pounder, is that you?
Lamb chop, what are you doing here?
Coast approach, baby.
Request immediate rendezvous upon landing.
(MIMICKING JULIA
CHILD) Welcome. (AUDIENCE LAUGH)
I'm Julia Child.
Today we're going to make a holiday feast or le fete d'holiday.
We're going to start with half-boned chicken or poularde, demi des Francais.
To bone the chicken, you need a very sharp knife.
You can't do nothing without a very sharp knife.
Now I've done it.
I cut the dickens out of my finger.
I'm glad in a way this happened.
Accidents do occur from time to time in the kitchen.
Have you been here long, kid?
Huh?
Been here long?
Not so long.
I've been doing standby at the tower for about a month.
It's just holiday relief.
Can I use your phone?
Yes.
535 please.
Frank, this is Al Yackey.
I'm the guy that was over this morning looking for the Skymaster that was being retired.
You said I could check it out as soon as
I found a pilot to fly it to Flat Rock.
I found a guy.
I'll be over in an hour to take it off your hands.
I'll bring the guy with me.
What are you doing?
I'm taking you back to Flat Rock with me.
I can't go.
Why?
Because...
...I'm here now.
Stop it, okay?
You don't play dumb with me and I won't play dumb with you.
I miss him, too!
I miss him, too.
I miss him every day.
I loved him like I never loved a guy and I don't love guys.
You don't have an excuse. You quit!
You quit. You gave up.
He never quit anything until it killed him.
That was his way.
There are worse ways and you sure found one.
(SOBBING) I can't live without him.
Bullshit!
Bullshit.
That's Al coming in from San Diego.
We'll talk to him.
He's a good guy.
He always sees the funny side. Want to cut your engine?
Reminds me of a girl I knew.
How are you doing, Linda?
You'd better land and sit this one out.
And make it fast.
MAN: (CHUCKLES)
Walk! Don't walk!
No swimming! No entry!
It's a fact.
I saw the signs. A-ha!
I saw all the signs.
Exit!
Falling rocks!
Jesus saves! Save water! Turn off the lights! Click.
Hi.
Danger!
Keep off the grass!
I saw the signs.
No shoes, no shirt, no service.
Yield. Tow away.
Use other door.
That's no way to live. (SIGHS)
No wonder I'm not giving lessons in love.
Lessons in love.
I can turn a plane on a wingtip.
I can stall a plane at 1,000 feet and come up smiling.
Come up smiling.
But that don't matter a damn.
Matter a damn.
You can hear me.
You can hear me.
I can hear you fine.
Hey, old-timer.
Just passing through?
Ted, listen to me.
How did you know my name?
Maybe crazy old hobos are like radio stations, picking up voices from people who've gone off the air.
So tune in, kid.
I want to get this through to you.
Get through to you.
With me, it was Dorinda.
Dorinda.
When you meet the woman you love...
The woman you love.
Not Dorinda, the one he loves.
Dorinda, the one you love.
After you're dead you can never go back for her.
Go back for her.
You can't turn around and do it right.
Turn around.
Do it right!
That's not what I mean.
What I'm trying to say is,
I've seen the signs.
No exit. No passing.
No parking.
No U-turn.
I'm going back to get my Air Attack card.
Tower, find Al Yackey and tell him Ted Baker wants to talk.
I like you this way, Ted.
You're revved up and full of moxie.
I hate you!
Charlie! Somebody!
In this world, you have to go out and get what you want.
Follow me?
Rachel, slow down.
Where is she taking us?
Ted!
Don't "Follow Me"!
Ted.
I think we're being a little gullible.
It's empty.
That's my boy.
I know him.
That's my boy.
Should I call the base?
We'll need a forklift again.
You all right?
I'm okay.
Al Yackey, please.
Yes, it's me.
No, I'm fine.
You should come down here and see how your boys redecorated my porch.
It's your deal.
I'm just renting.
Okay, I'll see you.
Hello, Dorinda.
I'm right here.
I'm sitting here...
...right beside you.
I know you can't see me, but
I can see you.
I can see your hair.
It's almost in your...
That's my girl.
You're still my girl, aren't you?
I thought so.
God, I wish we'd met sooner.
I wish we'd met when we were five.
I'd have swept you right off your three-wheeler.
You've still got a funny face.
I can't believe how much I miss you.
I miss you like it was a thousand years.
I remember everything.
I remember things I'd forgotten.
Like...
...from the first second I met you, when you were sitting alone in that restaurant and I looked at you and I said, "That's her."
"That's the one."
Do you remember?
I walked up to you and I said...
You're the reason
I'm here.
Ted Baker.
Wing 'N' Prayer.
I don't know your name, but we met...
Danced.
Uh...
We did?
Well, not exactly.
You were dancing with everybody and I tried to dance with you, but... Yeah.
Happy days.
You're here again!
Are you all right?
I'll have the fence fixed, I swear.
You never told me life was so exciting.
I can explain everything.
No, I can't.
People always dropping in.
Why are you still here?
I told you to leave.
He likes you.
He doesn't like anybody.
Is this your cat?
Yes.
What's his name?
Linda Blair.
You laugh like a donkey.
I like it. I...
...used to know a donkey.
Why are you still here?
Al, do you remember
Ted Baker? Ted, this is Al Yackey.
How have you been?
I'm stupid. You guys...
You must be one of Al's pilots.
I was.
That's a nice surprise.
Isn't it?
Yes, isn't it?
Indeed it is.
Yes, Baker is one of the boys.
I am?
Yes.
The lad shows a lot of promise. I do?
Dorinda is one of the toughest fire-fighting babes you'll ever see.
And funny.
She told a joke in mess the other day.
Milk squirted out half the nostrils on base.
One old guy laughed so hard he passed a kidney stone...
Yes, you did, you scalawag. Don't deny it.
She killed me.
I spotted.
Anyway...
Ted Baker, what should I call you? Baker, Ted, Teddy?
Let's get back to the base.
We've got some catching up to do.
You can show Dorinda the ropes later.
DORINDA: What ropes?
See you again,
Miss Durston.
Miss Durston.
He's so well reared.
You'll say anything, won't you?
Don't forget, you're still my girl.
Relax.
This is supposed to be fun.
You look like you're hanging in a closet.
Drop your shoulders.
Drop them.
I need you to go to town for supplies.
You'll need help lifting the supplies, so I'll send a guy with you.
Uh, let's see.
Baker. Yes, Baker.
He's too beautiful.
He's too much twisted steel and sex appeal.
I can't be with a guy who looks like I won him in a raffle.
A couple of drinks, a couple of laughs...
Hey...
You'll have time for the short, ugly guys later.
Hold your course.
I gotta relax.
You know what
I do to relax?
I sing. I hum.
I whistle.
Relax your shoulders.
Both of them.
This is fun. Relax.
I have to relax.
This was a great idea.
It's not my idea.
I know, but it's still great.
On my great idea scale,
I give it an eight.
An eight? Not a ten?
No.
No, ten is for stuff like penicillin and democracy.
But going to the store to get you supplies is an eight, tops.
Maybe even a seven and a half.
This is getting worse by the minute.
It wasn't my idea.
I know that.
"I'll tell ya, little missy, you're
"mighty pretty when you're angry." Uh-huh.
Oh, so you do impressions?
Just that one.
Uh-huh.
Who was it?
BOTH: Who was it?
James Stewart?
You think it was
Henry Fonda?
"Well, I'll tell ya, little missy, you're
"mighty pretty when you're angry." Wa-ha.
Henry Fonda.
John Wayne!
Don't you know who he is?
That was John Wayne?
Do it again.
No.
Oh, come on.
Come on.
If I know who it is,
I'll recognize it.
But Henry Fonda?
"Well, I'll tell ya something, missy...
"...you sure do look pretty when you're angry."
Wa-ha.
Wa-ha.
Wa-ha.
Wa-ha.
Wa-ha.
I'll sing to you.
I'll sing to you, you college boy.
I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy
She crossed the Missouri with her lover, Ike
TED: Whoa.
DORINDA: Is he drunk?
TED: I don't know.
(CHILDREN
SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)
DORINDA: Whoa.
Too close.
Hey, mister.
Go call the paramedics. Hurry.
WOMAN: What happened?
Call an ambulance!
(CHILDREN
TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
Well, Frank is sick and I'll try to help him.
Tell me your names.
Who's first?
Mario.
Todd.
Ascensión.
All right, what do you want to be when you grow up?
I want to work on Wall Street.
Wall Street?
I never had good enough grades to work on Wall Street.
What about you, Mario?
MARIO: I want to be an astronaut.
GIRL: I want to be a veterinarian.
BOY: I want to be a football player.
You did real good, stopping that bus before you died.
Come on, kid.
You can do it.
I have to go to the bathroom.
I have to go to the bathroom, too. Come on, Frank.
Hey, you made it!
Hi.
Hi.
Come in.
Thanks.
Holy cow, look at this.
Yeah.
You've been busy.
Kind of.
I had no idea.
Everything smells great.
Look what you've done.
She can't do toast.
You've got a little mashed potatoes right...
Oh. (CHUCKLES)
Oh, look at me.
Uh, let me go get myself fixed up.
There's something fishy here and it's not the chicken.
Then there was the time he delivered a PBY to to Michigan or Mexico.
Know what a PBY is?
Ketchup?
Sure.
He's taking off in this PBY, which is a feat in itself.
They're amazing planes.
TED: It's like a tugboat with wings.
Do they only feed you every two weeks?
What was I talking about?
Pete, still.
So he's flying this PBY when he sees this fire.
Forest fire.
Uh-uh.
Main Street.
Village grocery store.
The nearest fire engine is 20 miles away.
Oh, you can pick up the chicken.
Anything that flies, it's okay.
Even in a good restaurant.
Mmm-hmm.
He sees this building on fire and outside of town is this reservoir.
So he...
Fills the plane with water and dumps it on the fire.
No, he missed!
He hit the post office next door.
Took him three tries.
The town was awash.
The groceries were burned.
It was fire, flood and famine. If he'd managed the plague, it would've been the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in one PBY.
I mean, he was unique.
Why are you plucking your eyebrows?
Oh, I didn't know I was.
Nervous habit.
Want to do the wishbone?
Sure.
Okay, here we go.
Your wish.
He was up in that plane, doing his dumb stunts.
There would be this tone in his voice.
I called it his
"Evel Knievel" voice.
I don't know who he was when he sounded like that.
Part of you thought it was great.
DORINDA: What did he think I thought?
Was he dumb enough to think
I admired him for it?
For flying like that?
(SIGHS) Okay.
Do you think?
I wasn't there.
I shouldn't be talking about this.
Some birthday.
It's your birthday?
No, it's yours.
No, it isn't.
Since it was your birthday this time last year, it should be this year, too. No, no.
Pete remembered my birthday wrong.
It's a year tomorrow.
TED:
It's a year tomorrow.
A year?
I saw him land a plane once. I saw him dance.
He had his own way of doing both.
He could drive an A-26 around the sky.
He wasn't dumb.
You were impressed that he brought that A-26 in on an empty tank.
You try it.
When I do,
I'll have the height.
I'd like to be there.
I want you to be there.
What are you doing to me?
Trying to confuse you, I hope.
You are.
You never thought you'd dance again, did you?
I guess.
Shh! Hear that?
What?
There's no music.
That's my girl, pal.
Yes, put that one on.
Fast forward.
Keep going.
Keep going.
Keep going.
No, don't stop.
Left rudder.
TED: I think you got me all wrong.
You invited me because I'm a safe guy who will play along with your memories of Pete.
I don't have any memories of Pete.
I have memories of my own, but I don't let them get in the way of my life.
(SOBS) Oh, Hap!
Please! Please, take me out of here.
Can we...
...just finish this dance some other time?
I'm sorry.
Sleep tight, baby sister.
See you tomorrow.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'm going to see if old Dollar's tied to the hitching rail and ride off into the sunset by myself again.
(WHISPERS) Can I have this dance?
Lettuce.
Ketchup.
Peaches.
Cantaloupe.
Eggs.
PETE: You're shopping in your sleep again.
DORINDA:
Peanut butter.
Gin.
Anything special for me?
Chlorine bleach. (MOANS)
Chap Stick.
Band-Aids.
You always made me laugh.
Uh-uh.
Yes, you did.
You never laughed.
I never laughed at your jokes, but you were always very funny.
Liar, liar, pants on fire.
I swear to God
I'll keep you safe.
I'll never leave you again.
Yes.
Good night, Dorinda.
Night, Pete.
Hap. How did you get here?
I mean, how did I get here?
Mainly by the wrong road.
I told you, your life is over and anything you do for yourself is a waste of spirit, remember?
Yes, I remember.
But you didn't tell me everything, did you?
Do you know what
I've been going through?
Yes.
What do you want from me, Hap?
If I'm really dead, how come I hurt so bad?
What kind of deal is this?
You said I was going back to be an inspiration.
You never said
I would feel what I'm feeling.
You didn't tell me that I would...
...see Dorinda.
What do you really want from me?
We gave you a chance to say,
"I'm glad I lived.
I'm glad I was alive.
"Now it's my turn to give you a hand. Let me give you what I had."
But I also sent you back to settle with the one you love.
I sent you back to say goodbye.
Until you do that, she won't be free. And neither will you.
I'm not ready to say goodbye.
You're such a good man, Pete.
We don't send back the other kind.
But you still have to learn that to gain your freedom, you have to give it.
So go find out.
DORINDA:
Shake 'N' Bake, do you read?
Shake 'N' Bake, this is Tanker Base. Do you read?
TED: I read you, but I'm a little busy right now.
You've been up a long time.
How's your fuel reading?
How's your fuel?
Ted, leave your mike open.
TED: Okay,
I'm coming in.
He is really low on fuel.
That's beautiful.
How'd you teach him that?
You don't teach that.
He's got wings. Best I've seen since Pete.
What gives?
Baker coming in on a wing and a prayer.
You gave my crew
30 seconds warning!
That's all I had.
Jesus.
Another damn hotshot.
Another by god hotshot.
FIREMAN: Right behind you!
Round them up!
There's a cutback over here! Let's go!
MAN: Operations, this is Smoke Jumper's squad boss!
Say again, over.
Mayday!
We have a major blowout!
Our escape route has been cut off.
We're by the radio tower on the south side of Dome Peak.
Our only escape route is the gully to the southwest.
We're heading for the Kootenai River.
I can see the waterfall at the upper end of Bull Lake.
Get on the radio to the heli-base. Have the choppers standing by.
Libby Operations to Heli-base.
Ted, those choppers are 40 miles away. They fly at 100 miles an hour.
Libby Operations to Heli-base.
We're 12 miles away.
We fly at 220 miles an hour.
WOMAN: (OVER RADIO)
Libby Operations, this is Heli-base.
We read. Over.
Air Attack, 6-3 Echo, this is Operations.
We will handle the incident from here.
Contact the Jumper boss and ascertain their location.
Hey, Ted.
What are you doing?
Don't worry, Al.
I'll bring him back.
Nails, get me a WAC chart and sectional for Dome Mountain.
Get everything you've got together.
I'll take your plane.
It's my plane, I fly it.
We don't have time, Nails.
Get a load of mud and fill it to the tabs. I'll need all of it.
Not even that shithead Pete could pull this off.
But he would have tried.
I'll have your license for this!
I work for the Department of Agriculture...
Alex, get up on that ridge and see if we can get to the river!
MAN: Clear!
Dorinda.
You may want to come down here.
We've got sort of an emergency.
The wind shifted and the smoke jumpers...
Ted is going to fly into the gully above the waterfall.
Yes, honey, it's dark here, too.
You okay?
I see the water.
But there's a firestorm on the ridge.
Find out where they're heading then show me on the map.
How strong are the winds on the fire?
How about some coordinates?
Powerhouse!
I'd like to be in on this one.
You might get to.
Al wants to see you.
Great!
Don't cut it.
I'll hold it for you.
Winds from the southwest,
40 knots and gusting.
Dorinda, you throttle back and return that plane to the ramp right now.
Honey, we got six poor guys out there and I need 59 here, right now.
I don't know what you're doing, but turn this plane around.
You never would listen to me and you've always done fine, but this isn't the same.
This is Ted's mission and you're not good enough.
You won't make it.
Is that what you want?
That's not my girl.
Damn it, Dorinda!
This is no time to dick around...
...with an airplane!
Let's not be rational.
Throttle.
More throttle.
Level out. Level out!
And you say I flew crazy?
What are you doing? Fly smart.
Those guys need you.
I hear it!
If you've got water, use it!
Did you see that flare?
There they are.
Make a path for them to the river.
Ride it.
Ride it, Dorinda.
Slip right. Slip right.
Use the crosswind.
Right rudder.
Here we go. Come on, man.
Drop it now.
Too high!
Anticipation, 500 feet!
You've got to take it lower.
FIREMAN: Can't take much more of this!
You've got one more load.
You can do it, Dorinda.
Drop into the pocket.
Hold it!
It's too hot!
I know, baby, but you've got to get lower.
PETE: Throttle.
More throttle. (GRUNTS)
Ride it.
It's too hot!
PETE: That's it!
Now!
Pull out! Pull out!
FIREMAN: Go for the wet spots!
Go for the wet spots!
Pull out!
Twist out!
That's it. Twisting out!
That's it.
Get up. That's it.
You're going up.
FIREMAN: Head downriver!
This is Tanker 59 to Tanker Base.
I am fine.
The jumpers are in the clear.
Now I can tell you everything.
You'll have a wonderful life, Dorinda.
You won't have any more bad dreams. You'll go to bed happy and wake up laughing.
You'll be with people.
You'll have fun.
You'll have everything, including love.
I could never tell you how I felt the way I'm telling you now.
I'm only a thought, which you just think is your own.
But now,
I can say what I've always wanted to say.
I love you, Dorinda.
I love you.
I should have told you that a long time ago, without any jokes.
I should have said the words because I know now that the love we hold back is the only pain that follows us here.
And the memory of that love shouldn't make you unhappy for the rest of your life.
I hope you can hear me because I know this is true, from the bottom of my heart, how good your life is.
How good it will be.
Can you hear me?
Brush your hair from your face if you can hear me.
Brush your hair away from your face one more time, so I can see your eyes and say "goodbye."
I'm losing pressure.
Don't worry.
Try to make it to the water.
You can make it.
You can do it.
The water is easy.
PETE: Dorinda.
Dorinda.
I'm right over here.
Look at me.
Pete!
There is the rest of your life.
I want you to go to them.
I'm releasing you.
I'm moving out of your heart.
Go on.
Go on.
That's my girl.
And that's my boy.

I ask you now to pronounce judgment...
...on those accused.
On this...
This mindless aberration, whose only means of expression...
...are wanton violence and destruction.
On the woman, Ursa...
...whose perversions and unreasoning hatred of all mankind...
...have threatened even the children of the planet Krypton.
Finally, General Zod.
Chief architect of this intended revolution...
...and author of this insidious plot to establish a new order amongst us...
...with himself as absolute ruler.
The decision of the council will now be heard.
Guilty.
- Guilty.
- Guilty.
Guilty.
The vote must be unanimous, Jor-El.
It has therefore now become your decision.
You alone will condemn us if you wish...
...and you alone will be held responsible by me.
You will bow down before me, Jor-El.
I swear it.
No matter that it takes an eternity, you will bow down before me!
Both you...
...and then one day...
...your heirs!
You will bow down before me!
- Forgive me!
- I'll be back!
Forgive me!
Your mother Lara has sent you three blankets, of red, yellow and blue.
Their protection will ensure your strength.
It's kryptonite, Superman.
A little souvenir from the old hometown.
You were great in your day, Superman.
But it just stands to reason...
...when it came time to cash in your chips...
...this old, diseased maniac...
...would be your banker.
Mind over muscle.
Why did you kiss me first?
It... I didn't think you'd let me later.
Stand aside, now.
Free!
Nice fresh melons.
Nice fresh melons. Get them fresh here.
Good for the cooking, huh?
Look at this, the best.
"Lex Luthor's scheme bombs.
Superman saves nation.
Master criminal draws harsh sentence.
Exclusive story by Lois Lane.
Photographs by James Olsen."
Luthor, you never looked lovelier.
Lois, terrific job.
- Thanks, chief.
- Great story, really great.
Hey, good morning, chief. You're late.
Yeah, Miss Lane, that's a great story.
One of the best.
Well, Jimmy, usually a picture isn't worth a thousand words when I write the story...
...but in this case, congratulations.
- Yeah, thanks a lot.
- Yeah.
There's Mr. Kent. Bet he wishes he'd been around when it all happened.
Clark, he's never around when Superman appears.
Poor guy.
- You got a page in the front?
- Yeah.
Miss Lane got the best story.
Good morning, Lois.
Hi.
Lane, Kent, get in here!
Now, see, Jimmy, you got me in trouble.
- We were talking.
- So long. A big mistake.
Next time, don't do that to me.
- Good morning, Lois. How are you today?
- Oh, I'm just super. Thanks.
- Good morning, Mr. White.
- I'm super.
- Yeah, morning. You're late, Kent.
- I know. I'm sorry, Mr. White.
- I got stuck in traffic.
- Oh, that's a new one.
- Excuse me?
- I mean, as opposed to:
"I was stuck in a phone booth" or
"I got locked into the men's bathroom."
Lois, what are you talking about?
I'm sorry I was late.
If you two wanna bicker,
I have just the assignment for you.
You're gonna pose as a honeymoon couple to get an exposé on the newlywed racket.
Some of those hotels are bilking those poor kids for every cent they can get.
Real human-interest stuff.
Make your Aunt Hattie cry her eyes out.
- Newlyweds?
- That is a great idea, Mr. White.
- I'm sorry, but I'm in the middle of a series...
- I mean, it wouldn't take long.
We could just fly right up there and zoom back down again.
No, Superman?
Yeah. If he'd give you two a ride, maybe we could save a couple bucks.
I gotta see young Olsen.
Six lousy photographs...
...and that kid's hitting me up for a raise.
- Excuse me. Mr. White? Could we talk?
Darn.
You look like the cat who swallowed the canary this morning.
A canary? No, actually I was thinking of something bigger...
...something that flies, something more in blue.
Lois, as usual, I'm totally in the dark...
Let me just turn on the lights for you then.
Get the picture?
I didn't put this together until this morning. Which is really strange...
...because a good reporter isn't supposed to let anything slip by her.
Well, that's very amusing. Yes.
- Excuse me.
- Amusing?
- Yes, sirree, that's... That's very amusing.
- Amusing, huh?
Tall, broad shoulders...
...dark hair.
Gotta give you credit, you really had me fooled.
And I'm nobody's fool...
...Superman.
Superman?
You mean you think I'm Superman?
- Willing to bet my life on it.
- Lois, you know, you are priceless.
Really. That is the single most ridiculous thing I've ever...
- Lois, what are you doing?
- You wouldn't let me die, Superman.
- Oh, God.
- Help her out. Help her out.
- Clark!
- Lois, what have you done?
Clark, the... You're not...
Hey, Clark, you seen Lois?
She just stepped out for a minute.
This is how it ends for the greatest criminal mind of our time.
Not with a whimper, not with a bang.
How do they choose to reward Lex Luthor...
...the greatest genius in this world?
Do they give him glory or treasure?
What, matter of fact, do they give him?
Life plus 25, Luthor. Get to work.
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor.
It almost worked.
I mean, California almost fell down, right in the ocean.
Millions of people was almost killed.
If it hadn't been for that guy
Superman, that overgrown Boy Scout.
- I want my Liberace record back tonight.
- Tonight?
What are you gonna do with a guy like that?
He flies around so fast and everything.
I mean, they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got.
Every time they try, he just flies off.
- Where?
- North.
Why?
To ski?
Otis, every man has his vulnerable point.
Some, like you, Otis, have more than one.
I didn't see Superman's in time.
But now, through patience, invention, and skill...
...my little black box is just about ready.
Oh, that little black box in our cell?
That little black box, Mr. Luthor...
...what's it for?
That little black box goes beyond any normal, conventional radar.
It tracks alpha waves.
Alpha waves. Yeah.
I could've said it tracked pasta e fagioli, couldn't I?
Oh, with garlic, Mr. Luthor. And butter.
Boy.
Those alpha waves will take me north to his secret.
And when I have his secret,
I'll have Superman.
Slasher Fogelstein's a bed wetter.
Slasher Fogelstein's a bed wetter.
Pass it.
Hi, Mr. Fogelstein.
Too fast. Can you get the speed right?
I told you, they installed those three weeks ago.
Hey.
You follow the bouncing ball for a while.
Thing's giving me a headache.
Anyway, somebody's gotta check up on those guys.
Yeah, I keep on forgetting about them.
How long they been up there, 45 days?
The whole world's forgotten about it.
Houston calling Artemis II.
Houston calling Artemis II. Come in.
Morning, Houston. Hold on, Nate.
- Yo.
- How are things going?
All systems normal, Houston.
Andy is out doing the geological survey.
More rocks. Nice.
And cosmonaut Boris is getting some soil samples.
By the way, Boris and I are engaged.
I had a feeling about you guys when I saw your Rorschach tests.
Just a little détente humor there, Houston.
Surface conditions unchanged?
Well, it's mighty pretty out there. Mighty...
...pretty.
- Mighty pretty.
Right.
Look, Nate?
Nate, wake up, will you?
That's it. I'm dreaming.
Artemis, come in.
Well, Houston, we seem to have an unidentified flying object.
Unidentified?
- What does it look like?
- Well...
...a lot like a girl.
You.
- What kind of a creature are you?
- Just a man.
A man?
What a fragile sort of life form this is.
Houston, come in. Come in, Houston.
Come in, Houston. Come in.
Attempting manual liftoff.
Can somebody hear me?
Houston!
Come on.
Come on, Houston!
Oh, no. No!
Somebody help me!
- Artemis, Houston calling. Come in.
- What's going on?
- I don't know. We've lost contact.
- So?
Well, we really...
Artemis, come in, please.
All right, which one of you guys is using the hair dryer?
Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper.
And what he did was amazing.
- Something is happening.
- Yes, to all of us.
The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun...
...a yellow sun...
...the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers.
They come from there.
A place called Houston.
Then we will go there too...
...to rule.
Finally, to rule.
Three-eighty-two, out.
Three-eighty-three, out.
Three-eighty-four, out.
Three-eighty-five, out.
Lights out, Luthor.
I said, lights out.
You guys are about 10 seconds away from solitary, you know that?
I told you to...
Freeze, freeze.
Mr. Luthor.
- How we gonna get over that wall?
- How'd we get in?
- We flew in here, remember?
- That's how we'll get out.
Oh, no, not that guy.
Did you just go "psst"?
I wish I had, Mr. Luthor, before we left.
Not that "psst," that "psst."
- Don't go "psst" when I go "psst."
- You do it.
Go out there and find it.
- What am I looking for?
- You'll know when you see it.
I think I found it.
What is it?
It's a ladder, you dummy.
Hi, Miss Teschmacher.
Come on.
Hurry up. Hurry up.
Come on, hurry.
Otis, hold that ladder. Hurry up.
- Yard line, touchdown!
Oh, what a beautiful play.
But there's a marker downfield.
It could be against...
- Come up.
- Come on.
Here I come, Mr. Luthor.
- Get off. Get off.
- Otis!
- We're sinking!
- Get off, get off!
Very good,
Miss Teschmacher. Very good.
- What am I doing here? Why am I here?
- Miss Teschmacher...
...is this a philosophy seminar?
- No. This is a getaway.
- No.
- Getaway.
- Right.
It's ingenious. I don't know where you got the inspiration from.
I got it from you, Lex.
Hot air rises.
Would you like to take a trip?
A trip? A vacation.
Lex, I can go shopping.
I can buy a bikini.
You thought about me in a bikini while in prison?
No, I didn't, actually.
I thought about you in a parka.
You thought about me in a parka?
You are sick, Lex. You are really sick.
That's possible.
North, Miss Teschmacher.
Due north.
Lex, north.
That's what I said, due north.
- That's what you said.
- I know I said I said that.
- I just heard it.
- Yes, Lex.
Don't repeat what I say when I say something.
- I won't repeat what you say.
- Okay, don't.
Well, stop repeating me.
Excuse me.
Would you like to carry Mrs. Smith over the threshold?
It's sort of traditional.
I can give you a hand if you have trouble lifting.
- No, of course not.
- Honey. Thanks, I'll walk.
Certainly, dear.
Mush! Mush!
I am mushing.
North, Miss Teschmacher.
- North, north!
- Yes, Lex. North.
Oh, you must be wrong, Lex.
This couldn't be his home way up here.
"Wrong, Lex."
Miss Teschmacher, those are two words we do not use in the same sentence.
Well, it's funny there's no front door.
Miss Teschmacher, "funny" is a person trying to smile without any teeth.
Right.
All right, come on, Lex. Come on.
Move out of the way.
- This way.
- It's this way.
Lex, it's this way.
It's this way, Lex.
- Come on. Come on.
- Get off!
Come on.
- Fantastic.
- Fantastic.
It's fantastic!
The construction goes far beyond any known architectural theory.
- It's beautiful.
- It's beautiful.
- Lex.
- I'll be all right.
No, me.
Why can't you be more careful?
- It's beautiful.
- Beautiful.
- It has everything.
- Wrong.
- Why didn't you go before we left?
- That was two days ago.
Be careful, Lex.
Get...!
Frankly, I think this place is a little boring. It's all white.
Why doesn't the guy put up some pictures?
Maybe some bullfighting posters.
- Don't touch anything.
- Don't touch anything.
- Ice.
- I said, don't touch it.
- It's not ice.
- It looks like a crystal.
The virtuous spirit has no need for thankful approval...
- What the...?
... owning a certain conviction...
...that what has been done is right.
That's the old man.
He looks just like the kid.
- Are you the old man?
- Ask him where the bathroom is.
Develop such conviction in yourself.
Are you here?
- The human heart on your planet...
- He's not here.
It's a voice from the past.
That's cute. That's really cute. Nice.
Lies, monstrous deceptions.
So much for moral rearmament.
Give me another crystal.
Education crystal 108. Earth culture.
A typical ode much loved by the people you will live among, Kal-El.
Trees by Joyce Kilmer.
I think that I shall never see
A poem as lovely as a tree.
Come on, I like trees.
So does your average cocker spaniel.
Give me another.
Cute.
My son...
- The man never ages.
- Never ages.
...the time has come to tell you of the darkest episode in Krypton history.
- Now, this I wanna hear.
- Unfortunately...
...even on our peaceful planet...
...there have appeared once in a great while...
...certain antisocial elements.
Deviants...
...what you call on Earth "criminals."
Criminals.
Deviants. He was right in the first place.
Though of course, we are not a penalty planet like Earth...
...and these unhappy souls were almost always successfully transformed...
...into productive citizens.
- You never heard of Lex Luthor?
There were, however, three exceptions...
Only three.
Who proved impossible to rehabilitate.
There's hope.
Non, the destroyer.
Unreasoning violence in the shape of a being.
Ursa. Vicious, cruel, obsessed by a single-minded hatred...
...which could never be determined.
And the one force that could unite them...
...the only one whose warped genius could harness these forces of evil:
General Zod.
- He looks kind of cute.
- His intended insurrection...
...was the most painful episode our people ever had to endure.
But after a long and terrible battle...
...peace and harmony were once again restored.
Kind of an anticlimax.
We had, of course, no death penalty.
Sensible enough.
And so they were placed in the Phantom Zone...
...to be imprisoned for all eternity.
I do not know what could be done if they were to escape.
On Krypton, these villains were uncontrollable.
On Earth, each of them would have the identical powers...
...that you have.
Think of it. Three super villains.
All three with the same power he has.
All three totally dedicated to corruption, violence, evil.
They need a contact on Earth.
Someone who felt the same as they did, someone who...
...had the same wonderful contempt for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
Too true to be good.
Right?
- Miss Teschmacher?
- I found it.
I think.
- Where's Jimmy Olsen when I need him?
- Golly, isn't it beautiful?
Yeah, it's gorgeous. Gorgeous.
- Lois?
- Yeah?
Look. Everybody's holding hands.
Maybe we should hold hands too, huh?
- Here's my hand, Clark. Hold it.
- Thanks.
You know what? They're afraid to let go.
- Why?
- They let go, straight to the lawyer.
Oh, I don't know about that.
They look kind of happy to me.
That's because you're blind, Clark.
- Oh, yeah.
- Here.
- No, I've got it. No, I...
- Yeah. Clark.
You've gotta look after yourself.
You've only got one pair of eyes.
- God.
- Lois?
- Now, here.
- Right.
- Don't say I never did anything for you.
- Thank you.
Son! Excuse me, please.
- Be careful.
- What are you doing?
Get down! Get down!
You embarrass me here in front of everybody.
Lois, did you see what almost happened there? That little boy...
Hey, I'm hungry. You hungry?
- Lois, you're amazing.
- Why, because I'm hungry?
No. Here you are standing in front of one of nature's most awesome spectacles...
...and you're thinking about food. Aren't you impressed?
Clark, once a girl's seen
Superman in action...
...Niagara Falls kind of leaves you cold, you know?
Him again, huh?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I have a one-track mind, don't I?
Well, my one-track mind is telling me that I'm hungry.
- Hot dog?
- Hot dog.
Hot dog.
Could I have some orange juice?
- Freshly squeezed.
- Freshly squeezed, I know.
Hey, Mom. Look!
Yeah, honey. That's nice.
Okay, it's two mustard and relish, and...
Oh, my God!
Help!
Help!
Somebody help!
Do something!
Good.
Hey, Superman!
Way to go, Superman!
We got a great shot.
What a nice man.
Of course he's Jewish.
Incredible.
- There you go.
- Again, again!
No, I'm sorry.
Only one ride to a customer.
- Superman. Superman, it's me, it's Lois!
- Bye.
Come here. You're gonna get it!
- Give me a heart attack here.
- It's me. It's Lois.
It's Lois Lane.
Well, hello and goodbye.
So this is planet Houston.
A very strange surface.
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, that's all right.
- I just didn't hear you knock, that's all.
- Lois...
...the door wasn't even locked.
Just anybody can walk in here.
- There you go putting yourself down again.
- Very funny.
No, really, I'm serious.
Well, anyway...
...here, a little something for the newlyweds' dinner tonight.
Pansies. Clark, how...
How different.
Would you believe they grow wild all around here?
You should see what they charge for roses at the gift shop.
I'll bet, huh?
- You know something, Lois?
- What?
Well, you know, in spite of the unreality of all this...
Well, you know, posing as newlyweds for the sake of a newspaper story.
Well, in spite of myself even...
...I'm kind of starting to feel like one in a way.
- A newlywed, you?
- I don't see why that should be so strange.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.
I mean, I'm sure there's thousands of girls who'd...
Well, a few girls anyway.
- Go ahead and say it.
- Say what?
That somehow you're not satisfied being here with me.
That in some way I don't seem to shape up very well in your eyes.
I don't have anything to apologize for.
I'm a good reporter.
No, I'm a very good reporter.
And an even better friend to you.
- Stand up.
- Stand up?
Yeah, stand up, just for fun.
Now, come here. Look at yourself.
Just look at yourself.
What we have here is a potentially aggressive, dynamite guy...
...who can do anything he wants.
I mean, it's not my fault you keep putting yourself down.
- Oh, yeah? How?
- Well, for starters...
...you slouch all the time.
Here, stand up straight.
There, that's better.
And get yourself a jacket with a vent and shoes that don't lace up...
...and a shirt with a little color or a pattern or something.
And a bow tie that doesn't look like a letter opener.
All right, Lois. All right.
- We've been through this, haven't we?
- Yes.
I know where this is all leading to.
And I'm sorry. I mean, I'm sorry...
...but no matter how hard I try, I just...
Just... Just never will be him.
Him who?
"Him who"? Him Superman.
Now, I can't help the fact that you seem to think that you love him.
That's something I'll have to live with.
But darn it, Lois, that's enough now.
Maybe I just can't stand the competition anymore.
And just maybe you've been the competition all along.
Lois, I've never been particularly good at riddles.
Let me make this one really easy for you.
Why, with thousands of children potentially falling off something lethal...
...all around the world, would Superman be in Niagara Falls today?
Why not the Grand Canyon?
- Ask the child's family. I'm sure they know.
- Why is it always when I'm with you...
...until Superman appears?
And then you seem to disappear.
- Very conveniently, it seems to me.
- I was out for hot dogs. For Pete's sake...
When Superman appeared,
I looked at that hot dog stand...
...and you were gone.
- I was...
- Nowhere.
I can't help it if I had to go to the...
You are Superman, aren't you?
Lois, look, we've been through these hallucinations of yours before.
Can't you see what you almost did?
Throwing yourself off a building
30 stories high?
Can't you see the tragic mistake you almost made?
Yeah, I made a mistake.
I made a mistake because...
...I risked my life instead of yours.
Lois, don't be insane.
And don't fall down because you're just gonna have to get up again.
Lois, now, don't be crazy now. Lois!
It is you.
I guess I've known this for the longest time.
You realize, of course...
...if you'd been wrong,
Clark Kent would have been killed.
With a blank?
Gotcha.
A primitive sort of life form.
Did you see that?
Did you see what I did?
I have powers beyond reason here.
We all have them, my dear.
- Wow, this is your home?
- No.
Actually, I live in the city, about three blocks from you.
No, this is a very special place for me.
I wanted you to see it.
Listen, you warm enough?
I guess I should be freezing, but I'm not.
Good.
Come on, let me show you.
I don't know.
From the look of them,
I'll bet $ 10 they're from Los Angeles.
Hey, you hippies, get your butts off the road!
I like the globe. It flashes red like our Krypton sun.
But not this irritating noise.
Make way.
Did I hear right?
That son of a bitch give me an order?
Duane, you take care of it.
Just what in the hell do you think you're doing here?
What is this symbol?
Do you follow another leader?
Follow the leader?
Holy skunk sweat.
- All right.
- A weapon of some sort.
How the hell did you do that?
Jesus H. Christ.
- That was good.
- I thought we might...
...abandon the orange juice for once.
- Here, cheers.
- Cheers.
Must be tough being Clark Kent, isn't it?
No. No, I really...
I really like it sometimes.
Even though I do make a fool of myself.
But, you know, if it weren't for him,
I never would have met you.
But he is you.
- It's kind of confusing.
- Not to me, it isn't.
Everything's clear.
Until yesterday, a middle-American town that Middle America had forgotten.
But today, the population...
Exaggerated reports put it at 123.
Has increased by three.
And these three new arrivals bring destruction in their wake.
As I look west into
East Houston this morning...
...I see a town gripped with fear.
- Who's the guy?
Get that guy. Follow the guy.
Who's the big guy?
Okay, yeah, we've got a...
- You got that?
- No.
- That's fine.
- Try to wiggle it.
Who else is seeing this?
Well, with this satellite linkup, just about everybody. The whole planet.
The whole planet Houston?
Earth. The whole planet Earth.
You may continue.
As the extraordinary story continues...
- Enough of this man.
- As this extraordinary...
If the whole planet is watching, let's show them something interesting.
Throw down your arms and surrender!
This is an order.
General Zod does not take orders. He gives them.
He was in the line of that fire and nothing happened to him.
I haven't seen the likes of this since Superman.
Yes? Yes.
The Newsbeat control room has informed me that a fleet of helicopter gunships is...
- Mr. President, sir, can't we...?
- There's nothing anybody can do.
They have such powers, nothing can stop them.
Where's Superman?
Where is he?
Why doesn't he do something?
Fire again.
Fire again.
Look. They need machines to fly.
- Banking now.
- What bravery.
Be nice to them, my dear.
Blow them a kiss.
Rockets ready. Coming in on target.
Wait, wait.
We're out of control.
We're coming in, coming down.
Can't control it!
We're coming down.
I win.
I always win.
Is there no one on this planet to even challenge me?
Come forward.
Your general wishes to speak.
I am General Zod, your ruler.
Yes, today begins a new order!
Your lands, your possessions...
...your very lives will gladly be given in tribute to me.
In return for your obedience...
...you will enjoy my generous protection.
In other words, you will be allowed to live.
So you are a general?
And who is your superior?
- I answer only to the president.
- And he will answer to me.
Or all of his cities will end up like this one.
Thousands of hours to create, and they defaced it in seconds.
Imagine what they'll do to the world if we resist.
The people of your planet are well-pleased with you, Kal-El.
You have served them faithfully, and they are grateful for it.
And yet you have returned to reason with me once again.
My son, I have tried to anticipate your every question.
This was one I'd...
I'd hoped you would not ask.
My attachment...
...the feelings which I have developed for a certain human being...
...have deeply affected me, Father.
You cannot serve humanity by investing your time and emotion in one human being...
...at the expense of the rest.
- The concepts are mutally exclusive.
- And...
...if I no longer wish to serve humanity...
Is this how you repay their gratitude?
By abandoning the weak, the defenseless, the needy...
...for the sake of your selfish pursuits?
Selfish? After all I've done for them?
Will there ever come a time when I've served enough?
At least they get a chance for happiness.
I only ask as much, no more.
Yours is a higher happiness.
The fulfillment of your mission, an inspiration you must have felt.
You must have felt that happiness within you.
My son, surely you cannot deny that feeling.
No, I cannot...
...any more than I can deny the other, which is stronger in me, Father.
So much stronger.
Is there no way then, Father?
Must I finally be denied the one thing in life which I truly desire?
If you will not be Kal-El...
...if you will live as one of them...
...love their kind as one of them...
...then it follows that you must...
...become one of them.
This crystal chamber has in it the harnessed rays of the red sun of Krypton.
Once exposed to them...
...all your great powers on Earth will disappear.
Forever.
Once this is done, there's no going back.
You will feel like an ordinary man.
And you can be harmed like an ordinary man.
Think, Kal-El.
I beg you.
Father...
...I love her.
Think, Kal-El.
Come on. Come on.
Look out!
You are the one they call president?
I am.
I see you are practiced in worshipping things that fly.
Good.
Rise before Zod.
Now, kneel before Zod.
You are not the president.
No one who leads so many could possibly kneel so quickly.
I am the man they are protecting.
I am the president.
I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.
It will.
Starting with your own.
What a backward planet this must be...
...where the men wear the ribbons...
...and the jewelry.
What I do now...
...I do for the sake of the people of the world.
But there is one man here on Earth who will never kneel before you.
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?
I wish I knew.
Oh, God.
Zod.
Hey.
You're awfully quiet over there.
Yeah, I was just thinking...
...I can't believe what you've given up for me.
Are you kidding? I didn't do it for you, Lois, I did it for us.
See, I told you there'd be a hot dog place somewhere.
Okay. It sure takes longer when you can't fly.
Hurry up.
- Come on.
- Okay.
Come on, it's my treat. Come on.
Oh, boy, it's Mr. Wonderful.
Thank you.
- Do you have a men's room?
- Yeah. Right in the corner.
- Want to sit down?
- Yeah.
Hi, what would you folks like?
I'd like a cheeseburger with everything on it, and a Coke...
...an order of fries and a side salad, please.
- And for you, sir?
- I'll think about it when I get back.
Right. That's one cheeseburger...
- Steak and eggs, over easy, coffee.
- Can I have my Coke?
Coming right up.
- I'm sorry, that seat's taken.
- It is now, sweetheart.
Can I buy you something to eat?
No, thank you.
Excuse me. I think you're sitting in my seat.
Your seat's in there, four-eyes.
Gee, I think perhaps somebody ought to teach you some manners, sir.
Yeah? Well, let me know when he comes in.
- Look, Clark, we can just...
- Honey.
Excuse me, sir, would you care to step outside?
I said, excuse me, sir, would you care to step outside?
Now, listen, Rocky, your steak's coming right up.
Keep it on the flame, Ron.
This is just a minute steak.
After you.
- Clark.
- It's all right, honey.
Clark!
You all right, fella?
He's gonna be fine, just give me that.
- Clark?
- Blood. It's my blood.
I think maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.
I don't want a bodyguard.
I want the man I fell in love with.
I know that, Lois.
I wish he were here.
Clark.
Boy, you just don't have enough sense to stay down, do you?
You... You... You are no good.
Settle down!
I don't like your meat anyway.
Oh, God.
Clark? Clark?
Clark, can you get up?
- All right. Come on. I got you.
- Go slow. Go slow.
Try and get up in that chair.
- Sit down.
- I'm all right. I'm all right.
Okay, everybody, he's all right.
Just relax. We'll have some fresh coffee.
I'll turn the box on.
We interrupt this program for an urgent message...
...from the President of the United States.
This is your president.
On behalf of my country, and in the name of the other leaders of the world...
...with whom I have today consulted...
...I hereby abdicate...
...all authority and control over this planet...
...to General Zod.
Zod.
Only by strict compliance with all his directions...
...will the lives of innocent millions be spared.
Superman, can you hear me?
- Superman, where...?
- Who is this Superman?
- You'll find out. And when you do...
- Come to me, Superman, if you dare.
I defy you.
Come! Come and kneel before Zod.
Zod!
- Here? When?
- When?
Where the hell have you been, Mac?
On a desert island?
I have to go back.
You can't go back.
- There's no way now.
- I have to.
I've gotta try, damn it. I've gotta try something, anything.
It's not your fault.
You didn't know this was gonna happen.
He knew.
I heard him.
I just didn't listen.
You're master of all you survey.
And so I was yesterday.
And the day before.
Hello, there.
Lex Luthor.
Lex Luthor.
You've heard the name?
The greatest criminal mind on Earth.
I told you this was a puny planet.
Wait just a moment.
Wait until you get to know me better. Will you, please?
Wait. Look, I can give you anything you want.
I can give you the brass ring...
...the unlimited freedom to maim, kill, destroy.
Plus, Lex Luthor's keen mind.
Lex Luthor's savvy.
Lex Luthor's career guidance.
Lex Luthor's School of Better...
We have all of this without you.
You cannot bargain with what you don't have.
Magnificent One...
...what I am bargaining with is what you do not have.
The son of Jor-El.
The son of Jor-El?
I said that, didn't I?
Jor-El, our jailer?
No, Jor-El, the baseball player.
Yes, Jor-El, your jailer.
- The son of Jor-El? On this planet?
- Aye.
Possibly you know him better by his nom de voyage...
...or his name he travels under:
Superman.
So this is Superman.
How do you know of Jor-El?
My Fullness, as I explained to you before...
...I'm about the best there is.
Revenge.
We will kill the son of our jailer.
- Revenge.
- Revenge! Now we're cooking.
- He flies, then?
- Constantly.
- He has powers as we do?
- Certainly.
But, Magnificent One...
...he's just one...
...where you are three.
- Or four, if you count him twice.
- We will bring him to his knees.
Wait!
First, you must find him.
And Lex Baby is the only one who knows where he is.
What do you want?
Well, general...
...the world is a big place.
Thank goodness...
...my needs are small.
As it turns out, I have this affinity for beachfront property.
What do you want?
Australia.
Hey.
Listen... Hey, come on, where are you...? Please!
Father?
If you can hear me...
...I failed.
I failed you...
...I failed myself...
...and all humanity.
I've traded my birthright...
...for a life of submission in a world that's now ruled by your enemies.
There's nobody left to help them now...
...the people of the world.
Not since I...
Father!
Listen carefully, my son, for we shall never speak again.
If you hear me now...
...then you have made use of the only means left to you:
The crystal source through which our communications begun.
The circle is now complete.
You have made a dreadful mistake, Kal-El.
You did this of your own free will...
...in spite of all I could say to dissuade you.
I...
Now you have returned to me for one last chance to redeem yourself.
This too finally I have anticipated, my son.
Look at me, Kal-El.
Once before when you were small,
I died...
...while giving you a chance for life.
And now, even though it will exhaust the final energy left within me...
Father, no.
Look at me, Kal-El.
The Kryptonian prophecy will be at last fulfilled.
The son becomes the father, the father becomes the son.
Farewell forever, Kal-El.
Remember me, my son.
My son.
Father!
Harold. Coffee, black, no sugar.
Black, no sug... Yeah. Yeah.
Who's paying, huh?
No, no! There's three of them.
That cockamamie general...
...and a big truck with hair on it and a broad that looks like the queen of the runway.
They can fly, they can see through things.
Anything Superman can do, they can do.
Where is he, anyway?
Maybe he hasn't heard about it yet, chief.
- Maybe...
- Maybe he's just run out of guts.
- No sugar. And don't call me "chief."
- He'll be here.
- If there's any way at all, he'll be here.
- Yeah, he'll be here.
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
- Hey, Charlie, you feel that?
- Yeah.
Sounds like an earthquake.
Oh, my!
- It's those three.
- Stop!
- Oh, my God, they're here now!
- Oh, no!
This is scary!
You all right, chief?
Hi.
You should see the White House.
They'll be cleaning for months.
Lex Luthor.
Wouldn't you know it?
This is the son of Jor-El?
- No, but I bet you're a son of a...
- Jimmy!
You promised me the son of Jor-El.
Yes, Your Grace.
But what I've given you is the next best thing.
You just hold on to that little lady, and he'll be along.
See, they have this relationship.
She does all his public relations, and he gives her every exclusive.
They're the best of friends.
You know what I mean?
What an undemanding male this Superman must be.
You could use a tuck here and there yourself, sister.
Wait!
- I'm sorry!
- She lives for now.
Kill the rest, starting with him.
Wait. Wait, wait, wait!
Wait. Wait.
Don't you remember the White House?
The Oval Room? We had a few laughs there.
You ought to have that fixed.
General...
...haven't you heard of freedom of the press?
- Superman!
- Superman, thank God.
I mean, get him!
Come to me, son of Jor-El!
Kneel before Zod!
Watch out. You all right?
Son of Jor-El.
We were beginning to think you were a coward.
I'm not a coward, Zod.
It is extremely likely you are merely a fool.
Like father, like son.
Look out!
Then die as you deserve to!
Come on, come on, Superman! Get him!
Man, this is gonna be good.
Superman.
- Hey, that's the chief's.
- The chief's got it.
What, you hit a woman?
Oh, my God! My baby!
Help my baby!
Thank you.
This Superman is nothing of the kind.
- I've discovered his weakness.
- Yes.
He cares.
He actually cares for these Earth people.
- Like pets?
- I suppose so.
I'll draw his fire...
...with some of my own.
What's happening to those cars?
Get out of the way!
Superman.
Oh, thank you!
I never thought this thing would go the distance.
No! Don't do it!
The people!
Throw it!
- Get away from there. Get away from there.
- Let's help them out!
- I got her. I got her. Don't worry.
- He's dead.
Superman is dead.
They've killed Superman.
- He's dead.
- Let's go get them!
- Come on, we'll show them!
- I know some judo. Let's go!
Come on!
I'm holding it, I'm holding it!
What can you do if you can't see what's happening?
- Hold on!
- Oh, my God!
You can't leave us!
So he is a coward after all.
He's gone.
Come back, Superman!
Don't leave us!
He chickened out.
Phony!
Superman didn't even do nothing.
Come on, let's go.
- There they are.
- Get away from here. Jimmy.
Our victory is complete.
The son of Jor-El has fled.
- Superman fled?
- I don't believe you.
You heard him. Three against one, you should've taken two ears and a tail.
- He fled in fear of us.
- He'll be back.
As long as he's alive, he's gonna try again.
- The next time, we will kill him.
- The next time?
The next time?
What am I gonna do with you people?
I held up my end.
I delivered you the blue boy.
What do I get from my triple threat?
"Bow, yield, kneel."
That kind of stuff closes out a town.
Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it?
Kill me? Lex Luthor?
Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age?
- Eradicate the only man on earth with...
- Let me kill him!
Superman's address?
What more do you want?
I can see the greed written on your face.
A small incentive, O Fullest One.
A mere bauble to jog the memory.
What more?
Cuba.
I trust you are not wasting my time,
Lex Luthor.
Of course not, Your Turbulence.
Show yourself, coward!
Son of a coward!
I'm here, Zod.
- Let Miss Lane go, step inside. We'll talk.
- No, don't, Superman!
Please don't listen to him. He's just...
Stop.
Your powers are identical to mine.
But we are three.
We could tear you limb from limb.
Do it, Your Grace.
Just grab a leg and just make a wish.
But you are victim to another fatal weakness...
...your compassion.
The death of others means more to you than your own.
Yes, with rare exceptions.
Your father condemned us to an eternal living death. Your fate will be the same.
You will live, Kal-El, forever...
...as my slave. If not, then others will pay for your obstinate attitude.
Innocent people, millions if necessary, beginning with this Lois person.
- Don't, Superman, don't!
- Stop it!
All right, Zod.
It's over.
Your Grace, don't believe him!
You don't know him the way that I do.
I sense the presence of Jor-El here.
We will destroy this place.
And then kill him.
Him.
Him? Me?
General, this is Lex Luthor.
Remember...?
I helped you through the tough times.
I filled your inside straight.
You came to me with nothing.
I gave you Superman.
Silence!
Well, look...
Guy's a clod.
You think you know people, right?
Promises were made, gifts were exchanged.
I gotta hand it to you, you know.
You always told the truth.
A guy always knew where he stood with you.
Try to get them all into this molecule chamber here.
It takes away their powers, see...
...and turns them into ordinary human beings.
Now, if you could...
- Don't go in there. It's a trap.
- Luthor, you poisonous snake!
That's a molecule chamber.
It makes people like you into people like me.
- You've done well, Lex Luthor.
- I thought so.
Seize him.
- Kill her.
- No! Superman, no!
All right! All right, leave her alone, Zod!
You win.
General, the crystal there activates the mechanism.
Lex Luthor, ruler of Australia...
...activate the machine.
With your permission.
And now, finally...
Kneel.
Take my hand...
...and swear eternal loyalty to Zod.
He switched it.
He did it to them.
The lights were on out here while he was safe in there.
Hey, you know something?
You're a real pain in the neck!
Are you all right?
I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor.
A lying weasel like you couldn't resist.
Who, me? Are you kidding?
Hey, I was with you all the time. That was beautiful.
Did you see the way they fell into our trap?
Too late, Luthor. Too late.
Look. Look, Superman.
I got a proposition for you.
Now, don't stop me till you've heard this...
...because I know I owe you one, but we're in the North Pole, right?
Look, Lois...
No regrets, okay? I did it.
I got the man I loved to love me.
- Didn't I?
- Oh, yeah.
Well, okay then. Those people need you.
Do you think I don't understand that?
We can still see each other, you know.
I mean, all the time.
But it just can't be...
Just don't forget, that's all.
Don't ever forget.
- Well, here we are.
- Home sweet home.
- See you at work in the morning.
- Bright and early, huh?
- The same old Clark and the same old Lois.
- Yup.
Except... maybe I won't be quite so mean to you from now on.
You don't have to worry.
Your secret's safe with me.
I know. I know that, Lois.
Well, there he goes, kid.
Up, up and away.
- No!
- No!
- Hey, is Mr. White free?
- On the telephone.
- He's in conference at the moment.
- Yeah, that's what he says.
All right, give me three carbons of that.
- Hi.
- It's gonna be an insert in the paper.
That's what they said.
Good morning. Hi.
Good morning, Lois.
- Good morning, Lois.
- Hi, Clark.
Jeepers, I have seen some faraway looks in my time...
...but with that look, you might as well be on the North Pole.
The North Pole.
No, that's too silly.
Did you ever feel like you knew something that was so important that...
No, you never did.
I mean, I feel like I'm sitting on the single most important story of my career...
...and I can't remember what it is.
Well, knowing you, it must have been about Superman.
Maybe how he saved the city or saved the world or saved the universe.
Clark, Clark. Listen.
Jealousy's really counterproductive.
Now, there's some things that you can do too.
Oh, yeah?
Really? Like what?
Get us a pizza.
- A pizza. Now?
- Yeah, I'm hungry.
Actually, I don't think
Mr. White would like it if...
I'll pay for half of it, all right?
I'm going.
Lois?
You know, about the pizza?
It's okay. I'll pay for the whole thing.
You know, you're really super.
- Hey, Ron.
- Yeah?
Give me another plate of this garbage.
Garbage? That's my number-one special, Rocky.
All right. Get me some more coffee too, will you?
Gee, that's funny. I've never seen garbage eat garbage before.
Excuse me, sir. I think you're sitting in my favorite seat.
Come and get it, four-eyes.
Now cool it, Rocky.
Take it easy, will you?
I just had this joint fixed.
It cost me a fortune.
Oh, God!
This order's to go.
I'm terribly sorry about all the damage, sir.
I've been working out.
At the center of the universe... at the border between the light and the dark... stands Castle Grayskull.
For countless ages, the Sorceress of Grayskull... has kept this universe in harmony.
But the armies of darkness do not rest... and the capture of Grayskull is ever most in their minds.
For to those that control Grayskull will come the power.
The power to be supreme.
The power to be almighty.
The power to be masters of the universe.
Report, Evil-Lyn. Speak.
We have sealed the gates to the city.
The castle is secure and we are closing in on the Thenurian as we speak.
- Yes, yes. And He-Man?
- He continues to lead the resistance.
I assure you, we will have him before the day is out.
I want him kneeling at my feet.
After all this time...
- Grayskull is ours.
- No.
Mine.
The power of Grayskull... has not yet passed to you.
Someone is speaking to me.
Yes. Sorceress.
My lovely prisoner.
My prisoner at last.
I've won. I've won.
The darkness is rising to embrace you.
The dark can embrace the light, but never eclipse it.
You have not won yet, Skeletor.
He-Man is still alive.
- I can feel it.
- Really?
How sensitive you are.
Can you feel this?
Evil-Lyn, activate the holosphere.
People of Eternia, the war is over.
My forces are victorious.
The Sorceress of Grayskull is my prisoner... and her powers are now joined with mine.
Let this be my first decree:
Those who do not pledge themselves to me... shall be destroyed.
The new age begins.
- He-Man, thank the Sorceress you're alive.
- I've been looking for you.
Grayskull...
- It was terrible.
- How many units are left?
Not many. All of us were scattered.
Suddenly, they were everywhere.
- Chaos.
- Someone betrayed us.
Help! Help!
- Get me out of this!
- It's all right.
Help! Help! Help, somebody.
- Help.
- All right, all right, we heard you.
- Pull the pole out.
- Careful. Careful.
- Thank the Sorceress.
- I hear you.
Who are you?
I am Gwildor of Thenur... locksmith and inventor.
Skeletor's forces were hunting me down.
A million blessings upon you for saving my life.
No blessing is necessary.
Any foe of Skeletor's is a friend of ours.
Now, why are you so important to Skeletor?
Help me.
I'd better show you. Please come with me.
I remember the days we didn't have to lock our doors.
Those days will come back. Oh, yes.
Enter, enter.
Come on, come in. Welcome to my home.
Come on.
Come, come, come.
Now, you ask why is Skeletor after me?
Because of my invention.
Because of this.
Now I wish I hadn't created it.
Skeletor wants me killed so I can't make another one.
If he knew I had this prototype...
What is it?
What does it do?
I call it... the Cosmic Key.
It is the most unique key in the universe.
The tones it generates... can open a doorway to anywhere.
- Anywhere?
- Exactly.
One simply computes gravitonic tones... for a specific destination... activates the energizer and...
And that's how Skeletor's troops got into the city and surprised us.
Yes. Yes.
- I'm afraid so.
- You little worm.
- Don't you realize what you've done?
- Easy, Teela. He didn't know.
That's right. How could I know?
We Thenurians are a peaceful race.
Trusting in every way.
A woman came to see me.
Said she heard about my fame as a locksmith.
She seemed interested in my work.
How could I know she was from Snake Mountain?
- She was beautiful.
- That would be Evil-Lyn.
She tricked me. She stole the key.
Gwildor... can this device of yours get us to Grayskull?
- Certainly.
- To the Sorceress?
Those were the first coordinates
I calculated before she came.
- Oh, good.
- Oh, but we can't. We can't.
If we disturb the gravitonic waves,
Skeletor's key will locate us.
Sounds like he's already located us.
Warlord, to the point.
No, no, no. Not that way.
This way, the secret passage.
- Hurry. Hurry.
- Go.
- In the corner, there. Let's move.
- Right.
Gwildor, where does this lead?
To the caverns underneath Grayskull.
Ionize.
Gwildor, hurry.
- Yes, yes.
- Come on.
I don't like adventures.
Secure the room. Hurry.
Find the key. Tear this place apart.
He-Man, we made it. Look.
Ssh! I know he's here waiting for us.
- You're right. It's too quiet.
- Look. The Sorceress.
Come on.
Gwildor, hurry.
Be careful.
Quiet.
Sorceress?
Sorceress, we'll free you.
Skeletor has imprisoned me within this energy field... which only he can dissolve.
- You are in danger here. You must leave.
- We won't leave without you, Sorceress.
Gwildor, can your key open a door to the force field?
- Of course.
- Then do it now.
- It'll take time.
- Let's get started then.
Gwildor, over here.
I have to take a reading and compute the gravitonic tones.
- He's taking your power.
- I can withstand him until moonrise.
Until the Great Eye opens on the universe.
They're coming.
Gwildor, get back there. Keep working.
Come on. Come on.
Everything comes to he who waits.
And I have waited so very long for this moment.
- Let her go.
- I don't think so.
No.
While she remains imprisoned within this field... her powers increase my own, and when the moon reaches its zenith... the Great Eye will open and all the powers of Grayskull... will be bestowed upon me.
Your wondrous Sorceress...
- will die.
- You dare threaten her life?
I dare anything.
I am Skeletor.
Throw down your weapons and pledge yourselves to me...
- Or you will join her.
- It's not her you want, it's me.
It's always been between us.
Silence.
It's the locksmith.
- The little worm has another key.
- What?
No.
Kill him!
Cover Gwildor! Keep working.
Gwildor.
- Can that thing get us out of here?
- It will. It will. But where?
- Anywhere. Just do it fast.
- Yes, yes, yes.
It's working.
It's working, it's working.
Man-at-Arms, Teela. I did it!
- The door. It's open. Let's go. He-Man!
- No. I won't leave her.
But you must.
Eternia needs you alive, He-Man.
You still have until moonrise. Go.
He-Man, let's move. Come on, go.
Come on, Gwildor.
Stop him.
- Gwildor, come on!
- The door! The door!
- Gwildor!
- My key.
The key. Get the key.
Find them. Trace them!
I want them and that key hunted down and brought to me.
It looked as if he was punching the keys at random.
- There's no way of telling where they went.
- Monitor the frequencies.
Wherever they are, they'll use it again.
When they do, lock it in.
He-Man lives and possesses that key.
I must possess all or I possess nothing.
Find them.
Are you all right?
Trust a Thenurian to find a soft place to land.
Thank you.
I could have suffocated in that loathsome stuff.
Stop complaining. It's only mud.
That's easy to say when you don't have clogged gill slits.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, I... I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.
- Gwildor.
We must get back to Eternia.
So if you're through clearing your gill slits, maybe you can tell us where we are.
We could be anywhere.
Any planet in the galaxy.
Any planet in a thousand galaxies.
I had no time to renominalize my coordinates.
You got us here, you Thenurian wurbat, now you get us home.
Calm down. Now, we're all in this together.
How can he get us home if we don't know where we are?
I'm not a Torktum, you know.
I wouldn't build a device that didn't store its home coordinates.
All we have to do is punch the energizer switch and...
Where is the key?
Perimeter search.
Each of us take a sector.
What's that?
Scan the area.
Alien life form. Big.
- Let me blast it.
- Wait.
It might be intelligent life.
By the Sorceress, it's ugly.
It seems harmless.
What a hideous cry.
Maybe I can communicate with the poor creature.
Gwildor.
Gwildor.
Gwildor, we have very little time.
He-Man, I show 0.84 chromons until moonrise at Grayskull.
- We'd better find the key, and fast.
- What's your plan?
When we find the key,
Gwildor will set coordinates for Grayskull.
- We'll use the element of surprise.
- Drop right into the throne room... fight off 2- or 3000 of Skeletor's crack troops... break into the force field and free the Sorceress.
- Right.
- If we're gonna split up... we'd better synchronize our personal locators.
You both ready? And:
If you find the key...
- activate the sourcing signal.
- The sourcing signal.
- Good journey.
- Good journey.
Good journey.
Moo.
Moo?
Moo!
- Gwildor.
- I'm going. I'm going. Moo.
- Thanks. Come again.
- Sure thing, ma'am.
Billy, get off the game and get Daddy some napkins.
I never thought I'd feel sad about doing that for the very last time.
Don't worry, Julie.
They've got fast food in Jersey.
Thanks a lot.
I got a going-away present for you, but it isn't wrapped.
- You didn't have to do that.
- It isn't even in a box.
It's a piece of advice, and I pray to God you listen to it.
If you break up with Kevin Corrigan, you will regret it for the rest of your life.
Monica, this is not the seventh grade anymore.
Kevin's changed. I've changed.
Everything's different now.
Fine. Except for two things.
A: You still love him and B: He still loves you.
Kevin doesn't need me or my problems right now.
I just feel if I stayed...
Julie, I know it's hard right now... but you don't have to move away.
- Yes, I do.
- Your folks would've wanted you to stay.
The best thing for me to do right now is to get 3000 miles away from Kevin... my house, this town and everything, and just start out fresh.
- That's Kevin.
- I'm gonna miss you.
So, what time's your bus to the airport?
- Eight-thirty.
- Oh, great.
You can make my sound check, right?
Yeah?
- Yes, I'll make your sound check.
- All right.
- I brought us dinner.
- Oh, boy, Robby's ribs.
- I thought something different for a change.
- Oh, yes.
Yeah, well, it's not very romantic for our last date.
Look, Julie, why don't you take a later flight?
Kevin, don't start that again.
We decided.
Okay.
Kevin, I'd like to go to the cemetery to say goodbye to my parents.
Yeah, sure.
Don't ever sneak up on me like that.
This is my sector.
You're not supposed to be here.
An old soldier learns to follow his nose.
- Oh, father, you're always hungry.
- I'm not always hungry.
During the Siege of Kreyf, 30 days...
Without rations.
Father, the Sorceress.
We must find the key.
We're not gonna save Eternia if we die of starvation.
Wait. Look.
I was doing that before you were born.
Not the natives, Father.
There, in the bushes.
Gwildor.
Holding out on us?
Just in time. I was going to share.
I was going to share.
Sure you were.
Teela.
Good food.
Yes, I've never tasted anything like it.
I wonder why they put their food on these little white sticks.
Those are rib bones.
You mean this used to be an animal?
What a barbaric world.
Never think while you're hungry.
I think we've wasted enough time.
We better get back to our sectors.
Gwildor.
It tasted good.
- Gwildor.
- I'm going. I'm going.
I never told anyone this before, but it's my fault they died.
Julie, come on.
It was a plane crash.
Those things just happen.
You don't understand.
We were all supposed to go to the beach that day.
But I said I had to study because
I wanted to spend the day with you.
So they took the plane to Catalina instead.
Hey, come on.
Your mom and dad wouldn't want you to go around the rest of your life blaming yourself.
- Would they?
- No.
I wish...
I wish I could change things.
But you can't.
That only happens in fairy tales.
What is that?
- Julie, be careful.
- Kev, look at this thing.
That is incredible. What is it?
Don't know.
Someone must have dropped it.
Dropped it, are you kidding?
Look at the size of that hole.
It's like it fell out of the sky or something.
This is one of those new Japanese synthesizers.
- Here, let me try it.
- Okay.
Listen to this. Oh, this is hot.
We've got to turn this in to the caretaker.
No way, come on, are you kidding?
He'd just keep this for himself.
The Cosmic Key has been activated.
- We have a bearing on them.
- How accurate?
Within a parsec eon.
The next time they use the key, lock in the source and open a doorway.
- Shall I prepare a full battalion?
- No. It may be a trap.
We'll send an advance group.
Assemble the mercenaries.
Have faith, Sorceress.
You won't be lonely long.
Julie. Here, listen to this.
- What do you think?
- Sounds great.
Okay.
I want to see what this thing can really do.
Test. Test, test. Hello, test.
Here, hold that.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to amp this baby up.
See how it sounds.
All right, are you ready?
Hold on.
All right, here goes.
I can't believe it.
Override complete.
We're locking in on the key's source of origin.
Very good. Excellent.
You are too easily pleased, Evil-Lyn.
Have you forgotten time is of the essence?
Show me.
There. That's close enough.
- Have you assembled the mercenaries?
- Here, and awaiting your command.
I have selected your finest warriors.
Blade.
Saurod.
The Beastman.
And Karg.
A curious quartet.
He-Man has slipped away from me.
I want him back.
This must happen before moonrise.
Now, you are to go through to this world to where they are hiding... find the key... do as you wish with the others, but bring He-Man back alive.
You do understand?
Yes, lord.
Good.
Open the door. Do not fail me.
I... I can't believe this thing.
I mean, did you see those lights?
Look, we've gotta take this down to Charlie.
- He's gotta know what this is.
- No, you go ahead.
This sounds really strange, but I want to spend some time here alone.
Say goodbye to the place.
I'm not gonna be here for graduation.
Look, Julie,
I'll just go by Charlie's later, okay?
No, no, go ahead, I promise.
Are you sure?
Okay, all right.
I'll be gone 15 minutes, tops. All right?
- Don't let anybody in here except Carl.
- All right.
Hear me? Bye.
- I'll guard this stuff for you.
- All right. Bye.
Carl?
Carl, is that you?
- Blade.
- Deserted. No sign of the key.
Scan the perimeter. No one in, no one out.
Kevin, if this is some kind of joke, it's really not funny.
Listen, you kids can't just come in...
Don't kill him yet.
Leave him alone!
Somebody help me.
Somebody help me!
No, no. Take her alive.
She may know where the key is.
Over there.
That way. Go around.
- I've got you, pretty.
- No!
No!
Let go, stay away from me!
Let go!
Get her.
She's mine.
Stop her.
Somebody help!
Move, you animals. Go, go, go.
Find her. Find her!
Help me! Help me!
Somebody help me!
Oh God, help.
She's in there. This way.
She's in here somewhere. Find her.
- Get away from me.
- It's all right.
It's all right.
Don't be afraid, I won't hurt you.
Now, what are you running from?
I'm running from these, these...
- monsters.
- Easy, easy.
- These creatures...
- I'll take care of it.
Look in there.
You, look up that way.
Search over there.
- You. Over there.
- No.
Search in there. Hurry.
Here, take this.
Protect yourself.
She's over here.
This way.
No!
I've waited a long time for this.
My sword.
Pretty.
Retreat. Retreat!
Follow them.
They must have a doorway to Eternia.
Are you all right?
They're gone now. You're safe.
You're safe. Do you understand?
Good. I know you've been through a great deal, but I need your help.
Hey, hey, hey! Charlie.
- Charlie!
- Hey, Kev, how are you?
Hey, turn that down, turn that down.
Look, wait until you see this.
Oh, hey, I heard you were good last night at Club Zero.
Thanks. Thanks.
We're going to be better tonight.
- I want you to take a look at this baby?
- All right.
All right, here.
- What do you think?
- I've seen these before.
- You have?
- Yeah.
- It's Japanese.
- Oh, no, no, no.
I don't think so. Here, look.
Press a few of these buttons. Go ahead.
Now press that red button in the front.
Go ahead.
Far out. Fantastic.
You know, I guess if you've seen one, you've seen them all, right?
Thanks a lot, Charlie.
I'll talk to you later.
- Come back here. Where'd you get that?
- What?
- You wanna sell it?
- No, no. Look, I don't wanna sell it.
I found this at Laurelwood.
Man, you would not believe it.
It was like... It was lying in this huge crater.
I was just hoping you'd know something about it.
- I never saw anything like it.
- Look, we gotta figure out...
- What's that?
- How...
D sharp.
Oh, Mr. Perfect-Pitch.
All hell's breaking loose out there.
Let's see what's up.
All units, Code 6.
Proceed to Central High School.
Fire and vandalism. Possible arson.
All units, Code 6.
- Oh, my God.
- Proceed to Central High. Fire and vandalism.
- Julie's in there.
- Proceed with caution.
Our only hope of defeating Skeletor is to find the Cosmic Key.
Now, those creatures were after you for a reason, Julie.
Have you seen it?
- It's this large. It has lights on it.
- Wait a minute, I have seen that.
My boyfriend and I found this thing that had light and music coming out of it.
That's it. Where is it?
- Well, Kevin has it.
- He's in terrible danger. Let's go.
- Let's call it back.
- Everything's all clear in the room.
- Carl. Carl, what happened?
- You don't never wanna know.
Wait, listen to me. Carl, where is Julie?
What happened to Julie?
- There you go.
- Excuse me.
- Where you going?
- My girlfriend's in there, all right?
Kid, we swept the place.
The only person we found was the janitor.
No, you don't understand.
I just left her here 10 minutes ago.
I'm telling you, we went through there with a police dog.
The only stuff we found in there was right there.
Dear God, that's Julie's.
Where'd you find this?
Where do you think we found it?
Listen, we got vandalism, arson, we got a lot of bad stuff going on around here.
- What do you know about it?
- Look, I don't know anything about it, all right?
You're the cop.
Why aren't you looking for her?
- What does she look like?
- Look, she's about 5'5".
She's got short, dark hair.
She was wearing a pink sweater.
Is that all you're gonna do, you're gonna write?
Why aren't you out doing something?
I'll do something.
I'll take you for a little ride. Let's go.
Oh, great.
- What are you doing, arresting me?
- We're gonna go look for your girlfriend.
We'll try her house first.
I bet you know where that is.
Harry, do me a favor.
Take that down to Properties, give me a full report, okay?
Keep the coffee hot.
Looks like it's gonna be a long night.
Come on, guys, let's go. Let's put it out.
- He-Man, they got away.
- Easy, Julie.
What happened?
These are friends of mine:
Teela and her father, Duncan.
- Man-at-Arms for Eternian High Command.
- This is Julie.
She knows who has the key, wants to help us.
- Good.
- Did you have any luck?
- Not as much as you, apparently.
- We tracked them spinward, 40 metrons.
- Then they disappeared.
- They're only a scouting party.
Let's find that key before they return in full force.
- Julie, which way?
- This way.
Take arms. Full power.
Ready.
Native transportation. A primitive land boat. Enter, enter.
Gwildor.
Well done, Gwildor.
It was an inefficient combustible system, but I fixed it.
It runs on lucrenos now.
No hydrocarbons needed.
Why is there still resistance?
The people must know that I am Grayskull.
I depend upon you for these things.
You know that.
The people... wait for He-Man.
They believe that he will return to lead them.
For you to rule completely... he must be destroyed.
He-Man. If I kill him,
I make him a martyr, a saint.
No, I want him broken.
Where is the key?
We... traced the key's signal but were unable to take possession of it.
Is that all?
We... We fought with the Eternians, but were outnumbered.
We thought it wise to return alive...
- and gather a larger force.
- So He-Man's free?
You are all aware of the penalty for failure?
Give me one more chance, Lord Skeletor, and we will succeed.
I am not in the giving vein this day.
Get away.
He begs your forgiveness, as do we all.
- We live only to serve you.
- It would be a pity to waste their talents.
Save your pity for yourself, if you fail.
Take them and whatever troops and resources you need.
- I was not suggesting that I go.
- Then you should not have spoken.
Leave immediately.
When you find the key, send the sourcing signal.
An attack force will join you or I will follow.
Go.
Maybe your girlfriend's here.
The lights are on.
No. They leave that on to scare off burglars.
Oh, yeah? Let's go see.
Hey, not so fast, kid.
- Hello?
- Kevin, thank God it's you.
- Julie's not here right now.
- Kevin, this is Julie. What's going on?
Well, it's good to hear your voice, too, but I've been really worried about Julie.
- Kevin, is someone there? Are you okay?
- Yeah. That's what I thought too.
Look, this is important.
I know you can't talk, just say yes or no.
Do you still have that thing we found?
Thank God.
All right, listen. Don't do anything.
I have so much to explain to you.
Just stay there, we'll be right there.
Stay put, all right?
I love you. Bye.
- Okay, if you talk to Julie, could you tell her...
- Wait a minute.
This is the police, who is this?
Who is this?
- Who were you talking to?
- It was just a friend of Julie's.
- Say, you hungry?
- No.
You were talking about this thing, weren't you?
- What... What is this thing?
- It's a synthesizer.
Yeah?
- How does this thing work?
- Just press these buttons right here.
- Like this?
- Careful, careful.
Do you want to know something, kid?
I don't think this is any synthesizer.
This is where they ambushed us.
We didn't have a chance.
We'll see. Scanner.
I see only He-Man.
Where are the forces that you spoke of?
And a native girl.
It must have been she who tipped the scales against you.
Outnumbered?
- Outclassed is more like it.
- The key has been activated.
Lock onto the signal.
It's close. About 10 metrons.
You wanna see what that thing does, press the red button down at the bottom.
What? This one?
Holy smokes.
What are you, a magician?
How do you stop this?
What's a kid like you doing with something like that?
- Come on. It's my instrument.
- Yeah.
All right, look, let me heat this up, then I'll show you, okay?
We're getting interference.
They're jamming the signal.
Locate the source of the jamming and destroy it.
It's difficult, like nothing I've seen before.
Destroy it now.
Watch... Watch out.
The source of interference is destroyed.
We have a clear signal from the key.
Lock it in. We'll track it from the air.
Turkey, sit down.
- No more crapping around. What is this?
- I don't know.
Listen, I got vandalism, I got arson,
I got stuff blowing up in my face.
- You better know something.
- Look, I found it, okay?
- Found it? You don't know who the owner is?
- No.
Listen, I was gonna go put a note down at Charlie's Music Store.
Know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna take this to the station... put it on the computer, check it out, see if it's reported stolen.
Now, for the last time, kid, where'd you find this?
Laurelwood Cemetery.
It was in a flowerbed.
Look, if you don't believe me, go ask Charlie, all right?
- Go ahead, ask him.
- Boy...
- I just may do that.
- Hey, you can't just take that.
Oh, yeah? You just watch me.
Don't worry about your girlfriend. We got an APB out on her. She won't get far.
As far as this is concerned, don't worry about it.
If your story checks out, you'll get it back.
If.
Get out of here! Get out of here.
Get out of here.
What do you want from me?
No. Leave him.
You have the Cosmic Key.
Tell us where it is.
I don't know what you guys are talking about.
- Let me persuade him.
- No.
The collar.
Please. Look, I don't know what you want.
Now... you will answer my questions.
Yes.
Have you seen... this object?
Yes.
Where is it?
- It was taken from me.
- Who took it?
A policeman.
Where is he now?
I don't know. He...
He just left.
We should be able to track the key from the air.
Yes.
Prepare the transport immediately.
Wait. Evil-Lyn, I found this.
This is the native girl who is helping He-Man.
- This may prove useful.
- Into the transport. Move.
Move it out!
Move.
- Fan out.
- Moving.
- Looks like Skeletor got here before us.
- It's all clear.
- Stay ready.
- Kevin!
Kevin.
Oh, my God, Kevin, you all right?
He's bleeding.
What happened?
They asked me for the key, but I didn't have it.
- The Cosmic Key.
- Kevin, did they take it?
No.
- A policeman took it.
- Where is he now?
What is this thing?
- What's the matter?
- Skeletor's work.
The Collar of Aldruber.
They've been questioning him.
- I'll have it off in a moment.
- He'll be all right.
Who put this on you?
A woman.
- Strange eyes.
- Evil-Lyn. She's here.
From the looks of this place, she definitely wasn't alone.
Right.
You all right?
Julie. Julie, get out of here. Now!
Damn.
- Kevin, these are my friends.
- Your friends? Julie.
Look, will somebody tell me what the hell is going on here?
- These creatures come in and beat the crap...
- Kevin, listen to me.
These people are fighting the others.
- They saved my life, now trust me.
- Trust you?
Julie, I swear to God, these... things come in here...
I mean, look at this place.
Look. Look. Native clothing.
Lots of it, all over the place.
If we dress like this, no one will recognize us.
- What the hell is that?
- See?
That's Gwildor.
Look, Kevin, I'll explain to you as we go.
We've gotta help these people find the key.
- Are you well enough to go with us?
- Go with you?
Tell us where that policeman was headed and we'll take it from there.
- Kevin, please.
- I wish I'd never seen that damn thing.
Okay, look. He said he was gonna go to Charlie's Music Store, all right?
- It's at Landmark Mall.
- Can you show us the way?
- Of course.
- No.
Charlie, the kid said you know about this kind of stuff.
You don't think this could be Russian?
Well, what do you know?
The mountain comes to Mohammed.
Hey, how come I get this feeling
I've been looking for you all night?
I believe you have something that belongs to us.
- Let me guess. That music gizmo there?
- By the Sorceress...
Freeze. All of you.
Choice, really choice.
What's this, a circus act?
Somebody's gonna give me some answers here.
- Let's start with you, blondie.
- We're not your enemies.
If you'd just give us that, we would be very grateful.
You get nothing until I get some answers.
- He-Man, He-Man. Someone's following us.
- What the hell is that?
Neutrino Drive,
18 metrons and closing fast.
- It's them.
- At 10.
They've locked in on the key.
- Hey. Drop your weapons or I...
- He-Man.
Gwildor, how long to calculate the coordinates and take us home?
I don't know.
The keys have all been moved.
- Boy, are you people in trouble.
- He-Man, 0.61 chromons until moonrise.
- Teela, take these people in the back.
- Let's go.
You can't order me around.
If you'd rather stay and face
Evil-Lyn's commandos, that's fine.
Look, believe me, sir, you wouldn't.
Evil-Lyn, just as the signal indicated... the natives and the key are within the structure, but...
- Yes, Karg?
- He-Man.
The Eternians have already arrived.
Beastman, full-force attack at my command.
Karg, Blade... follow me.
How do you feel?
I'm feeling a little hungry.
- Gwildor, you've got to hurry.
- I'm working as fast as I can.
There.
There's Grayskull, and that puts us... there, but we have to be there.
Twenty metrons forward if we wanna break through... the barrier of the
Sorceress' force field.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I don't understand.
Now, what are you trying to do?
The universe is music, Kevin.
Hey, this is really weird?
Reminds me of
Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
The part where the pods started taking over people's bodies.
You don't know who are pods and who are the bodies.
Shut up. They're psychos, Corrigan.
We've stumbled onto some loony fringe group here, some kind of cult.
Our guests are arriving.
- Gwildor, how much longer?
- I don't know. I don't know.
I'd give all the chalconite in Fribillian... if I could only spend two units with a master song maker.
- You think they don't like us?
- No, they're just lonely.
They miss us.
Go.
He-Man.
What the hell is going on out there,
World War III?
Ain't that your buddies getting their heads blown off?
Kevin, you know how to use one of these?
Don't let him out of sight.
Guard the key with your life.
If anyone comes near it, blast him.
You understand?
They're killing each other out there.
- Is Gwildor ready?
- Not yet. The room's secure.
It sounded like you needed a woman's touch.
Woman-at-Arms.
Give me the gun, kid.
Come on, give me the gun.
Don't you get it, Lubic?
All right, this is for real.
She meant what she said.
- I said give me the gun.
- No.
Look, we've come this far.
We're not giving up until they get home.
Look, don't stop, Gwildor, all right?
Don't say I didn't give you a chance.
When this is over, you're going to jail:
Accessory to assault, resisting arrest, endangering lives.
I guarantee, you and all your buddies.
I'm gonna put you away for 850 years.
What are you looking at, shorty?
Mark my words, Corrigan, you're going to jail, you hear me?
Yeah, Lubic, I hear you.
Lubic, listen to me.
Lubic...
Just relax, okay?
- All right, Gwildor, you need anything?
- Give me that thing.
Hey. Kevin, stop it.
Watch that gun.
Come on, you're gonna get hurt.
- Mother?
- Yes, darling, it's me.
But the plane...
I'm so sorry you had to go through that, Julie... but we had to disappear.
We're doing very important, very secret work.
Oh, honey, I've missed you so much.
I don't believe it.
Mom.
Listen, darling.
Your friends are tied up with the work we're doing... and they have something we want.
That shiny metal thing.
With the blinking lights.
Will you get it for us?
Charlie!
Charlie!
Moron kid. Watch your arm, pal...
I don't believe it.
I've got a lot of serious work to do.
You're acting like Torktums.
Julie. Where's Julie?
- I...
- Kevin, you won't believe this.
- They're alive.
- What's the matter? Where were you?
Julie.
Julie!
The key. The key.
Thank you, my darling.
No!
- Julie!
- No!
- No.
- Julie.
Where are they going?
Teela. He-Man. Hurry.
The key.
- That way.
- Bring Gwildor.
Hold them.
Down.
- That woman took the key.
- Let's move.
- Gwildor, come on.
- I'm going. I'm going.
Charlie, you got a gun in here?
A gun, a gun. For holdups.
- In the front room, under the counter. I got one.
- You got one? Go. Come on. Let's go.
Oh, my God. My store.
- My keyboards.
- Look at this place. Look at those guys.
This is an invasion. Give me the gun.
- Give me the gun. Give me the gun.
- All right, all right.
- Stay right there.
- No problem.
Police. Nobody move.
Holy shit.
I think I'm gonna need some backup.
Ready to transport.
I will send the signal to Skeletor.
- What's happening?
- Hurry, keep moving.
The key. Someone's opening a door.
A very big door.
- Cover your eyes.
- What's that?
- This way, hurry.
- Into the alleyway, hurry.
- Let's go.
- By the Sorceress. Come on.
It's him! It's him!
Contact Evil-Lyn.
Evil-Lyn, Skeletor demands a report.
I have the key, my lord.
The natives are fools.
Weak and easily controlled.
- They are...
- And He-Man?
- He has eluded us.
- That will be all.
Air Centurians, find him.
Come on.
- Hurry.
- Air Centurians.
Down.
- Quick, he'll be back.
- All right, let's move. Come on.
- Come on.
- They're coming.
- This way.
- Hurry.
Come on.
- On the roof.
- Go, go.
Go. Go.
- They're turning around to come back.
- Keep moving.
Gwildor, your grappler, give it to me.
On the roof.
Hurry. Go.
- Where's He-Man?
- There.
No!
Fire.
He must not use that key.
Centurian, lead him to me.
What do you say, Gwildor?
Any signal from the key?
There's got to be something.
Unfortunately, no.
Nothing.
He should be here by now.
I'm not worried about He-Man.
He knows how to take care of himself.
I'm more worried about getting us out of here before they find us.
I only have two numbers left.
Once we get the key back, we'll be gone within two pretons.
I think not, Gwildor.
Not the way to treat your beloved ruler.
Throw down your weapons or you die.
Gwildor... you minute minion...
I have you to thank for all these troubles. Why?
I had such grand plans for you.
I would never knowingly serve the lord of Snake Mountain.
- Wait till He-Man arrives. He'll see to you.
- Will he?
I expect him at any moment. Take them.
Torktums.
He-Man, no! It's a trap!
Julie!
- No.
- He-Man.
Kevin?
Stay where you are, He-Man.
One more move... and your friends will not live to see another day.
It's gonna be all right.
I give you a choice.
Return with me to Eternia as my slave... and save their despicable lives... or perish with them on this primitive and tasteless planet.
Surrender your sword.
He-Man, no.
Teela, I have no choice. This is our fight.
- I don't want innocent people to die.
- Well said, He-Man.
How noble.
- Take care of them.
- Good journey.
Good journey.
What about them, sir?
Leave them alone.
He-Man is my slave.
As long as I let them live, he is bound by his word.
Let them rot.
Let them rot.
Let me look at her, Kevin.
- What's wrong with her?
- This is Skeletor's particular gift.
- Gwildor, we need to get back to Eternia.
- Immediately.
There's little chance of that.
The power core's melted down.
The tones are erased from the key's memory.
There's no way home. No way.
Here. Cover her with this. Teela.
She's burning up.
We've got to get her water.
There's a fountain down below.
- Good.
- Up.
Okay, move out, let's go.
- I'll take the west perimeter.
- Unit 3, keep coming from there.
Okay, Lubic.
- Where's the army?
- Will you shut up!
They were here, I'm telling you.
It was the damnedest thing you ever saw.
- Everybody, follow me.
- Let's go, guys.
Let me see this.
Oh, my God.
- What's gonna happen to her?
- The poison's already in her blood, Kevin.
- The wound will keep growing...
- Only our Sorceress can heal her now.
I'm sorry, Kevin.
Look, don't be sorry, just find a way to get us back, okay?
I mean, there's got to be a way.
Isn't there?
Gwildor?
No.
You see, Kevin... opening a dimensional door is relatively easy.
But the tones, Kevin... the tones that were stored in this Cosmic Key... were completely erased.
Skeletor knew what he was doing.
Even if I could fix it, we could search for a thousand years... and never find the tones that will take us home.
But wait a minute. The tones.
You mean the melody the key played every time we pressed the red button?
- Yeah.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What is it, Kevin?
God, I wish that thing would shut up.
Thanks. Okay.
Wait a minute, I've got it.
That's it. How did you do that?
I don't know, I just... if I hear a tune a couple of times, I can usually remember it.
It had a good hook.
I was going to use it in one of my songs.
Songs?
Why didn't you tell me you were a song maker?
Are you a master? Yes, you are.
I know that.
That's why the fates brought us here.
The final chord, Kevin.
Twenty metrons poleward.
Pull it out of the air for us.
You've got the wrong song maker, Gwildor.
All right, I'm just a stupid keyboard player in a high school band.
There's a million of me.
Only one of you, Kevin.
Only one of anybody.
Listen to me, boy.
In half a chromon... we're not going to have a sorceress to go home to.
So if you know how to do something with that thing, then you do it.
Gwildor, Kevin knows the tones.
Can you get us home or can't you?
Yes.
Yes, I think I can.
I need a few things.
A bossonic tesseract.
- Right here.
- An octode rectifier.
I have an octode rectifier.
- And something to play the tones on.
- I'll get a keyboard from Charlie's.
- Look, take care of her.
- I will.
I win.
How long?
- Half a preton until moonrise.
- Do you hear, Sorceress?
The final moment has come.
All the forces of Grayskull... all the powers of the universe will be vested in me.
Me. And you will cease to exist.
- It is not too late to undo this madness.
- Madness?
I demand the destitution, shame and loneliness of scorn.
It is my destiny. It is my right.
- Nothing will deter me from it.
- Men who crave power... look back over the mistakes of their lives... pile them all together and call it destiny.
Thank you for that bit of philosophy,
Sorceress. Here is my response.
Yes, Sorceress.
The sword of Grayskull.
Mine.
Now and forever.
Your champion.
Witness this moment, He-Man.
This moment when the powers of Grayskull... will become mine for eternity.
Our lifelong battle is ending at last in the only way it could.
Holosphere standing by.
When the Great Eye opens... the people of Eternia shall see you kneeling to me... just before you die.
- I'll never kneel to you.
- Yes, you will. Yes, you will.
Or I shall wreak unforgettable harm upon you.
Lubic, let me drive you home so you can get a little rest?
I was in Korea.
I never saw anything like this.
- That's him. That's him.
- Not again.
- Come on, Lubic.
- Come on, we're moving in.
I got it.
- How is she?
- The same, Kevin.
Okay, this should give us the tones we need.
How?
Just press the keys.
Keys? What keys?
Oh, no, no, no. Here.
Excellent.
Wonderful.
You never told me you had sonic keys in this world.
I just hope it helps, Gwildor.
- Thank you, Kevin.
- It's okay.
I'll have this ready in a preton.
Kevin, please don't leave me.
I promise you, Julie...
I'll never leave you.
Never.
I love you.
Enough.
Where is your strength? Where has it gone?
Look at your precious Sorceress.
An old crone. Weak. Withering.
Dying.
Are you ready to kneel now... proud warrior?
The moon rises to its apex.
Do you hear?
The alpha and the omega.
Death and rebirth... and as you die... so will I be reborn.
What are they doing over there?
We've gotta stop this fast.
- Okay.
- No.
Stay here and cover me. Spread out.
- And wait for my signal.
- Yes, sir.
These guys are mine.
People of Eternia.
I stand before the Great
Eye of the Galaxy... chosen by destiny... to receive the powers of Grayskull.
This inevitable moment will transpire before your eyes... even as He-Man himself bears witness to it.
The Eye opens.
Now, I, Skeletor... am Master of the Universe.
Yes.
I feel it.
The power fills me.
Yes.
I feel the universe within me.
I am... I am a part of the cosmos.
Its energy flows... flows through me.
Of what consequence are you now?
This planet, these people... they are nothing to me.
The universe is power.
Pure, unstoppable power.
And I am that force. I am that power.
Kneel before your master.
Fool.
You are no longer my equal.
I am more than man.
More than life.
I am... a god.
Now... you will... kneel!
Kneel!
- Are you ready, Kevin?
- Yeah.
I'm going to set the power. Now, here goes.
Now, Kevin, now.
Freeze. Nobody move.
You're all under arrest.
Throw down your weapons and place your hands on your heads.
- You have the right to remain silent...
- Lubic, you don't understand.
- We've gotta get back.
- Nobody's going anywhere!
Where are they?
Where are your friends now?
Tell me about the loneliness of good, He-Man.
Is it equal to the loneliness of evil?
- Holy shit.
- We did it.
- Gwildor, get down.
- Destroy them.
Take cover!
- You promised not to hurt them.
- I lied.
Farewell, He-Man.
Block him.
Get him.
Give He-Man some cover action.
Kevin, watch the rear.
You. Watch the forward position.
Will somebody tell me what's going on around here?
- I feel like I'm in The Twilight Zone.
- Lubic, this is for real. Just get down.
Hey. Nobody takes pot-shots at Lubic.
All right, you wanna play games?
Then let's play.
Come on, you mother...
No. Don't kill him. I want him alive.
You cannot hide from me.
- Karg, prepare the battle station.
- Surely you won't leave with Skeletor still...
Yeah. Warlord, let's go.
Signal the retreat.
No.
I have the power!
You.
You will no longer stand between me and my destiny.
But I will.
I told you it was always between us.
I ache to smash you out of existence.
To drive your cursed face from my memory forever.
- Enough talk.
- Yes. Let this be our final battle.
Skeletor.
- It's over.
- Yes.
For you.
No! No!
He did it. He-Man!
- Victory!
- Victory!
Victory.
Well, Lubic, look at you.
- So you're really gonna stay here?
- Are you kidding? Why would I go back?
And look what I got here. I got a castle.
I got a view, I got clean air,
I got a beautiful woman.
Some kind of retirement?
Julie, keep this with you and Eternia will always be near.
Thank you.
I guess this is really goodbye?
He-Man...
Teela, Man-At-Arms.
Don't. Don't say goodbye.
Say, "Good journey."
There's an old Eternian saying:
"Live the journey... for every destination is but a doorway to another."
Good journey.
Take care, Julie.
- You look after her, now.
- I will.
Activate the doorway, Gwildor.
Are you sure you don't wanna go back in your planet's history?
I could take you back in time to the past or future.
No. Look, Gwildor, that's okay.
Just send us home.
We better get home, Gwildor.
- Good journey, Julie.
- Good journey, Gwildor.
Good journey.
Gwildor. Wait. Send us back...
Mom, Dad, hi.
- You're up bright and early.
- You're all right.
What's this all about?
I love you both so much.
I don't ever want to lose you.
We're just going away for the day.
We'll be back tonight.
No.
I changed my mind.
I do wanna go to the beach with you today.
Don't go to Catalina, okay?
- Don't be silly, honey. Stay home and study.
- Mom, Dad, please.
Don't get on that plane today.
I have a terrible feeling.
Julie, your father's an excellent pilot.
It's a short trip.
No.
- Julie. Julie, put those keys back.
- I love you.
Julie, where are you going?
Come back here.
- Julie.
- Kevin.
- Don't let your parents get on that plane.
- I've already stopped them.
Wait a minute.
You know?
Yeah.
We were there.
Eternia.
I have the power!
I'll be back.
Help me.
And so, as the sun rose... over the island of Cheese... casting long shadows through the sausage bushes... illuminating the tops of the honey trees... and warming the fields of smoked salmon...
I, Baron Munchausen... who am renowned first and foremost for telling the truth... the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
For while it has been my privilege...
- Tighter! Tighter!
- Hold steady!
How can you become a great actress like me... poor darling, if you get blown to pieces?
- Come on!
- Native land.
Oh, yeah!
There to attempt the education... of their provincial and narrow-minded... and stupidly incredulous fellow countrymen... we heaved anchor and set sail.
We heaved anchor and set sail!
The waves!
- Oh, bugger!
- We heaved anchor.
- We are actors!
- And set sail.
Where the devil are the stagehands?
- Dead!
- They can't all have been killed!
Not killed, ducky.
Suicide!
Nothing to do with your acting.
We heaved anchor...
But ill luck pursued me... and I was blown towards the waiting jaws... of a whale of such prodigious size and length... that I could not, even with a telescope... see the end of him.
What will become of the baron
Surely this time there is no escape
What will become of the baron
Surely this time there
Is no escape
I have learned from experience... that a modicum of snuff... can be most efficacious.
Hells bells... and buckets of blood!
Where were the waves?
The waves!
You've stabbed my vitals!
- You incompetent imbecile!
- It wasn't me!
It was her!
It wasn't me!
It was him! You big pintle!
We are supposed to be professionals!
And we're trying to stay alive!
- Sally!
- All right.
Now stay in here or I shall lock you up.
- Where's my brother?
- What?
You haven't got a brother.
Then you just tell me why it says,
"Henry Salt and Son."
- I'm your daughter.
- I shouldn't have taught you to read.
"And Son" is traditional.
That's the way it's supposed to be.
No. The sultan's demands are still not sufficiently rational.
The only lasting peace is one based on reason and scientific principle.
I'm terribly sorry,
Mr. Jackson.
The first act didn't go quite as we would have liked.
One or two little technical problems.
Oh, please don't apologize, Mr. Salt.
I'm sure you're doing your best... in very trying circumstances.
- Your attention.
- Hmm? Ah, excuse me.
The officer who risked his life... by single-handedly destroying six enemy cannon... and rescuing ten of our men held captive by the Turk.
Yes, sir.
- The officer we've heard so much about.
- I suppose so, sir.
Always taking risks far beyond the call of duty.
I only did my best, sir.
Have him executed at once.
- Yes, sir.
- Come along.
This sort of behavior is demoralizing for ordinary soldiers and citizens... who are trying to lead normal, simple, unexceptional lives.
Things are difficult as it is without emotional people rocking the boat.
Constantinople.
The court of the grand Turk.
What a surprise... that a passing zephyr should waft me here.
Perhaps fate wishes me... to teach the sultan a lesson or two.
His highness the sultan loved a good wine... and could never resist a wager.
Characteristics that were to cost him dear.
Lies!
Those scoundrels!
I won't put up with it!
It's intolerable!
Stop this travesty!
Stop it!
It's an insult!
An indignity!
I've never seen so much rubbish in all my life!
You don't know what you're talking about!
One day, after a sumptuous dinner...
- Is this supposed to happen?
- The sultan bade me to accompany him... to his private apartments.
Uh, please. No, don't.
Please.
This blackguard's an impostor!
I am the Baron Munchausen, and I won't be made a fool of!
- Please! You cannot come up here!
- No, no!
- We are presenting a performance!
- You are presenting a mockery.
You present me as if I were ridiculous fiction. A joke!
I won't have it!
What the devil's going on?
Curtains!
Boo!
Get him off!
Old fool!
You're ruining the show!
Quick! Jeremy, Bill, do something!
I must talk with my audience.
Ladies and gentlemen, I must...
I must apologize for this most dreadful occurrence.
I can assure you that...
- Hello.
- Hello.
Beautiful ladies.
Hello.
Beautiful ladies.
You have really great taste, sir.
Otherwise, it's all quite wrong!
Listen, cocky.
We've got a show to do.
Good lord! Berthold!
Who's Berthold?
How on earth?
It's marvelous to see you!
How are you?
Where've you been?
How are your legs?
Where are the others?
Albrecht!
Adolphus!
Gustavus!
I can't believe it!
This is miraculous!
- I'm Bill.
- He's Bill.
Is he still here? Will you get rid of him, for goodness sake!
- What is the matter?
- I'm terribly sorry, sir.
- We were about to start the second act.
- Who is this?
I've no idea.
Some old lunatic.
He's Baron Munchausen.
Oh, I see.
The real Baron Munchausen.
Yes, indeed.
And who, sir, may I ask are you?
A public servant.
I am responsible for, among other things... the licensing of this theatre.
This, sir, is the Right Ordinary
Horatio Jackson who just happens... to be winning the war and saving the city.
Now please leave us!
- He's an ass. Only I can end this war.
- Explain yourself.
I can end it because I began it.
I am the cause.
I'm afraid, sir, you have rather a weak grasp of reality.
Your reality, sir, is lies and balderdash... and I'm delighted to say that I have no grasp of it whatsoever!
This man obviously needs a doctor.
A doctor?
We will continue with the show.
Thank you very much,
Your Ordinaryness. Off!
Please be reasonable.
If we don't get on with it, he'll throw us to the Turks
I'll get on with it!
Show them how it should be!
My lords... ladies and gentlemen...
Baron Munchausen, at your service.
Pruned any noses recently?
- Give us a song!
- No. Please.
Most of you won't remember me or my adventures... but I assure you... they are true.
The truth is...
I am the cause of this siege.
- Don't be stupid!
- What about the Turks then?
You're the cause of the border dispute, are you?
What? It's the sea routes we're fighting for!
No, it isn't!
That was last time!
You poor deluded fools!
If you'll only do me the courtesy... of accepting the word of a gentleman...
I will reveal the true cause... of this war.
After my...
Oh, dear.
After my return from Egypt...
I was most warmly welcomed... by the grand Turk... his highness, the sultan... who knew of my reputation... and held me in high esteem.
In fact, so delighted was he with my company... that he offered me access to his harem.
- One day...
- Go on!
The sultan brought me a bottle of his favorite Tokay.
What do you think of that, eh?
Not bad.
Not bad?
My dear Munchausen... it's impossible to find better.
Humbug, Your Majesty.
What do you wager that I won't procure... within the hour, a bottle of Tokay far superior to this... from the imperial cellar in Vienna... a mere thousand odd miles away?
Accept my challenge.
If I don't succeed, you may cut off my head.
These are my stakes.
What are yours?
I accept.
And if you succeed... you may take as much treasure as the strongest man can carry.
Agreed. Give me pen and ink, and I will write to the empress immediately.
Berthold!
Coming!
Oh, blast!
Sorry, chaps.
I've got to go.
Take this to Vienna, to the empress.
She will give you a bottle of wine.
Bring it straight to me.
Right-o.
Perhaps you would care for a little light entertainment while you wait.
I have been composing a short opera.
- Would you like to hear a song or two?
- No, thank you.
Oh, you'll love it.
It's a comedy.
It's called,
"The Torturer's Apprentice."
Here's the overture.
The curtain...
The curtain rises on a typical everyday torture chamber.
Yosrick, the young apprentice, sings of his joy in his job.
A torturer's apprentice went his merry way to work one day
I bend and stretch and ply my trade
Making people all afraid
But things look black
Business is slack
There's no one on the rack but me
Act four is set in an abattoir.
I see a lot of slapstick.
We begin with the arrival of the eunuchs' chorus who sing...
"Cut Off in My Prime."
Cut off in my prime
Surrounded
By beautiful women all the time
A eunuch's life is hard
And nothing else
Excuse me a moment.
Oh, you won't want to miss this aria.
It reminds me of my school days in England.
Life is rather like a game
It's important that you win
And though it seem a terrible shame
If you lie and cheat
And sin
Lay up and win
The game
Steady.
Where the hell's Berthold?
- Don't know.
- I though he was with you.
Well, if he's not here in three and a half minutes... the sultan will cut off my head!
- And?
- And?
Is that all?
I'm sorry,
I don't find that funny. Do you?
This isn't a joke!
It's a wager!
A wager!
He's asleep.
I can hear him snoring.
- About 900 miles away.
- Come on.
He's under a tree!
Near Belgrade.
- What?
- There's a bottle beside him.
- Hope he hasn't been at it.
- So do I.
What's the wind speed, Gus?
Three knots.
I'm a modern man
These days I find you have to be
Awfully cruel to be kind
I'm a modern man
You will agree
It's either you or me
Well!
Time's nearly up, I think.
Ready.
Now!
- Not late, am I?
- No.
Not late, thank you very much.
Thanks.
I needed a trim.
- Much obliged.
- From the empress.
Delicious!
You win.
Treasurer, allow my friend here to take from the treasury... as much as the strongest man can carry.
Yes.
That's it.
Thanks, squire.
I must speak with the sultan.
- What is it?
- Excellency! They've taken everything!
What?
Gustavus!
Stop them!
Bring them back!
Gustavus! Again!
Fire!
Don't shoot!
- Stand firm!
- Take cover, my friends.
Regroup!
Let me in!
And so... as you can see, the sultan is still after my head.
Hey, wait!
Stop! Don't go!
Come back!
There's more!
I haven't finished!
Don't leave now!
We're about to make off with the sultan's treasure.
You can't just stop.
The name's Desmond, mate.
We're actors, not figments of your imagination! Now get a grip!
Oh, come back!
What the devil is the sultan playing at?
It's Wednesday, isn't it?
I'm terribly sorry about the show.
One or two minor setbacks here, sir.
This theatre's closed. I want you and your company out of the city.
Oh, no, sir! No!
No, sir. Please!
Give us a say! Sir, look at these favorable endorsements from Europe.
"Mr. Salt's company holds a mirror up to nature." "Vienna Clarion."
"Great value for money."
"Paris Echo."
"A good night out." "Glasgow Herald."
Just give us one second.
Here, boy.
Good boy. It's all right.
Here, boy!
Are you all right?
Am I dead?
No.
Blast!
Who are you really?
Baron Munchausen isn't real.
- He's only in stories.
- Go away! I'm trying to die.
Why?
Because I'm tired of the world.
And the world is evidently tired of me.
But why? Why?
Because it's all logic and reason now.
Science. Progress.
Laws of hydraulics. Laws... of social dynamics.
Laws of this, that... and the other.
No place for three-legged cyclops... in the South Seas.
No place... for cucumber trees... and oceans of wine.
No place for me.
- What happened in the story?
- What?
In the sultan's palace.
Did you escape?
- Were you killed?
- I don't know.
It was all a long time ago.
Who cares?
I do.
I'm very tired. Good-bye!
- Please tell me.
- No.
- Go on.
- Buzz off!
Tell me!
Please.
You really want to know, don't you?
Stop it!
We'll all be killed!
And then I'll never know the end of the story!
Wait! Where are you going?
Come back!
Stop it!
Wait! Come back!
Take cover!
Wretched child!
Get that powder under cover!
Yes, sir!
No!
Stop it!
Get away!
Stop it!
Head down!
- No!
- You'll get us both killed.
I thought you wanted to die.
Yes, but I'm old enough.
Gentlemen!
Don't you think it would be a good idea to silence those enemy cannons?
- No, sir.
- No?
It's Wednesday.
Oh, my... Wednesday!
Oh, no!
The Turks are about to storm the walls.
You really are Baron Munchausen.
That's it. The end.
It's all over.
Generations of theatrical expertise snuffed out... in the twinkling of an eye.
Sally?
Get off!
Come here.
You cretinous, senile old fart!
Thanks to you, we're to be thrown to the Turks!
But he is Baron Munchausen!
The real one!
- You must believe me!
- Hurry!
No, honestly! He is!
- Shut up!
- But he is!
And he can save us!
Can't you?
He jumped onto a cannonball.
He really did!
And he flew miles up into the sky!
- Above the elephants and soldiers...
- God! Stop lying!
I'm not lying! Am I?
As a matter of fact, you are.
But he did.
And those soldiers saw him too!
They'll tell you!
Oh, they're dead.
- But he did!
- No, I didn't.
Now you're lying!
I never lie!
Stay here!
What's got into you?
I didn't fly miles.
It was more like a mile and a half.
And I didn't precisely fly.
I merely held on to a mortar shell in the first instance... and then a cannonball on the way back.
You maniac!
You've done for us!
Actually, it doesn't matter whether you're thrown out or stay here.
The Turks are about to take the town.
Quickly!
Bring those guns out!
I'm just coming into my prime!
I'm just on the cusp between Romeo and King Lear.
My public will kill me for dying at a time like this.
- Save us!
- Yes.
Save us!
- Don't disappoint me!
- Please, Baron. Please.
- You are a baron, aren't you?
- You're our only hope!
You are my only hope.
Ladies! Please!
I swear that as long as I...
Heronomous Carl Frederick,
Baron von Munchausen live and breathe... you shall come to no harm.
You so remind me of Catherine the Great... empress of all the Russia's... whose hand in marriage
I once had the honor to decline.
They all remind you?
Yes, why not?
Some bits here, some bits there.
I have a plan!
I will set forth immediately... find my extraordinary servants... with their help, raze the siege and save the town.
Oh, brilliant.
Oh, very good. Bravo!
- How?
- Ladies, I'll require your assistance.
Of course.
- Anything!
- Just tell us what to do.
Kindly be so good as to remove your knickers.
Yes, well done there.
Look at all that underwear.
Isn't it beautiful?
It's like a dream come true.
It's the dawning of the age... of lovely, intimate things.
But it's madness.
He'll kill himself.
- Yeah, but well worth it, eh?
- What are you doing?
Enough nattering.
Keep pumping!
Hey.
Better report this.
You're right.
We need a very simple plan.
These are far too complicated.
- Simplicity is of the essence.
- Sir.
Those actors have made an air balloon.
They're trying to escape.
Arrest them at once.
Thrown them out of the town.
We can't open the gates, sir.
Well, throw them over the walls, then.
Yes, sir.
We can't start escaping at a time like this.
What would future generations think of us?
Right.
Follow me!
Just hold it!
Don't let it go!
Hold it, Adolphus!
Bring it down.
Yes.
Bring the ladder over here.
Take care!
Baron!
- Oi! Have you seen Sally?
- No!
- Oh, thank you, my dear.
- Stop!
- You're under arrest!
- Let go!
Quickly!
Quickly! Let go!
Take aim!
Fire!
Ladies and gentlemen...
I shall shortly return with reinforcements.
Don't lose heart.
And for all those ladies... to whom I am indebted for half a ton... of frilly silk and lacey linen:
Don't catch cold!
Au revoir.
Stay, Argus!
I'll soon be back.
I will wait for you!
Come back soon!
He won't get far on hot air and fantasy.
Blast!
Hang on!
Keep...
- Thanks.
- Now you've ruined everything!
I'll have to douse the fire to let you down.
- I'll never get off again!
- I'm going with you.
I absolutely utterly refuse!
If we go down now, we'll land on the Turks.
We've got to find your servants... and get back here quickly.
That is what I had in mind.
- Where are we going?
- To the moon.
What? That'll take ages!
- No, it won't.
- Of course it will.
- Why are we going there?
- That's where I last saw Berthold.
Have you ever been to the moon?
- No.
- Ah! Interesting place.
The king and queen are charming.
You know about their detachable heads... don't you?
No.
Their heads go off for intellectual pursuits... while their bodies engage in more... bodily activities.
The trouble is their heads and bodies don't always see eye to eye.
You do believe me, don't you?
I'm doing my best.
Are you scared?
Certainly not!
- You?
- Certainly not!
Grab the rope!
We're here!
You look different.
Younger.
I always feel rejuvenated by a touch of adventure.
Heaven's sake. Don't you get any younger or I'll have to find a wet nurse.
Look!
You'll find that I'm one of the king's special favorites.
We shall receive a right royal welcome.
Now what?
I got you at last.
Your Majesty, what a great pleasure it is to see you again.
May I introduce my friend Sally?
Sally, King of the Moon.
Well, his head at any rate.
I'm sorry, you must refer to me by my complete title...
King of Everything...
Re di Tutto, but you may call me "Ray."
The moon is a very insignificant part of my domain now.
There is so much, much more.
My old friend, you seem to be in some discomfort.
What ails you?
Nothing ails me. Can you not see that I am at one with the cosmos?
I tell you that, and all you can say is, "ah"?
What are you blind?
Baron, let me explain it to you.
Since you were last here, I, that is my head, that which is left of me... where the brilliant and important parts are located... is now ruling and governing the known universe.
And that which I don't know,
I create.
I just created spring.
But seriously, without me, there would be nothing. Not even you.
I think, therefore you is.
Your old friend's a lunatic.
So it would seem.
Certainly fallen prey to delusions of grandeur.
Being in tune with every molecule in the universe... requires a great deal of concentration.
That is why having you on the loose,
Baron, does not help.
You see, your little stories are somewhat of a distraction to me.
You are like a mosquito in the Taj Mahal.
I must inform you, My Liege, without my adventures, you wouldn't be here.
Well, so I am now part of your adventures.
Well, we shall see about that, huh?
Now, Baron.
Who created who?
I hope you'll be very comfortable. Ciao.
There goes my revolting body with the queen.
Oh, stop it!
Oh, I'm tired!
- I'm exhausted!
- Go away! Damn it. He can't hear me.
Please, oh!
Oh, you stinking horrible man!
Oh, it's so embarrassing.
Please don't look.
Maybe he will go away.
It is hard to believe my body and I were ever attached.
We are totally incompatible.
He is dangling from the food chain, and I am in the stars.
It is so unmetaphysical.
No! No, go away!
I despise you!
Let me go!
I'm back!
I got lips again, and I'm going to use them, baby!
It's me!
I'm your elephant of joy!
- Give me bacio, baby!
- Yes, but eat first, darling!
That's right.
You've got to mangia before bacio!
You can't do that when you don't got no mouth!
Baron!
I'm back in business.
Oh, yeah.
You don't go nowhere.
- Baron.
- Oh, most wondrous Majesty.
Hey, I know you.
You're the little guy tried to make off with my queen the last time.
- Huh?
- Moi?
We have no more of that, piccolo Casanova.
What are you looking at?
There you go, lovebirds.
I'm sure you'll be very uncomfortable.
I am free again.
Free to concentrate on higher things.
Why don't you go back and amuse yourself with this slime?
Oh, you missed me!
I'm blind! Wait! My kingdom for a handkerchief! Wait!
Let me go! I've got tides to regulate!
Comets to direct!
I don't have time for flatulence and orgasms!
I hate that face you make me make. That...
Please. Please, no!
I don't want any more bodily functions!
Oh, no.
Please let me go!
- I don't have time for this!
- Farewell, Baron.
One of the king's favorites?
This cage isn't real.
It's just part of the king's lunacy.
It seems solid enough to me.
I see we're not in a very helpful frame of mind.
How are we supposed to save the town from here?
The town is perfectly all right.
The peasant assault is over.
Everyone is quite safe.
How do you know?
I just know.
What the devil?
All right. I'm coming.
My hand!
Come out.
Come out of there.
- Come out of there!
- Ow! Stop that!
- What did you do that for?
- I thought you might be unfriendly.
Of course I'm unfriendly.
- You'd be unfriendly if I prodded you.
- Who are you?
I can't remember.
- I've been here so long.
- We'll be like that... if we don't escape.
Why are you here?
Oh, I'm a very wicked criminal.
- What have you done?
- I can't remember.
How do you know you're wicked?
Well, for one thing...
I'm in here.
And for another...
I've got these shackles on.
- Berthold!
- Eh?
It's Berthold!
It's me! The baron!
I knew I'd find you on the moon.
I'm going to take you back to Earth to help us fight the sultan!
Get off me!
You're Berthold!
My old servant.
Those leg irons are to slow you down.
Stop you tearing off all over the place.
- You must be joking.
- You always wore them. Remember?
- You're crackers!
- I'm Baron Munchausen.
Hmm. That sounds nasty.
Is it contagious?
We're wasting time!
Darling Baron!
Ariadne.
I'm sorry I couldn't speak with you before... but Roger's so difficult.
Where exactly is Roger?
In bed with my body, of course.
Stop it!
If he discovers my head's with you...
Quickly!
Climb into my hair.
Why is she making those funny noises?
Her body is with the king... and he is... tickling her feet.
- Oh, no!
- Berthold.
- Come on!
- Let go of me!
- You're coming with us.
- No chance.
- Why not?
- I can't remember.
- Are you frightened?
- That's it!
- Come on. Help me.
- Stop it!
Quickly.
Climb aboard.
Give me your hand.
- Hold tight.
- I don't want to escape!
- Here we go!
- Gosh! I can't hold on!
I love these!
I tickle you till dawn, darling.
There we go!
There! I wipe everything away.
There! Tickley! Tickley!
Darling, you love this!
I know you do!
But you don't say anything!
Why you don't say anything?
You are a pillow biter!
Hey! Tickley! Tickley!
Baron, I must get back to Roger before he notices I am headless!
I quite understand.
Darling. Take me with you.
- Back to Earth?
- Oh, yes!
Without your body?
I thought you loved me for myself!
I did.
I mean, I do!
Of course, I do.
- It's just...
- We have to go!
I think you're right, aren't you?
It's impossible.
Oh! Take a lock of my hair.
Just a lock, cocky.
Not the whole carpet.
I'll treasure it.
The king! I must go!
Au revoir, my dear Baron.
Yes! I'm coming, Roger!
Darling, I'm going to drive you to China!
Let it out!
Oh, my God! Where is your head?
No wonder you're so quiet.
I'm too rough. I knock it off?
It's around here.
I find it. We play "head and seek."
Hold on! Oh, you play a trick?
Darling, come out!
You're not here!
Where you...
You are with the baron.
You are with that little man.
You told me size don't make a difference!
You puttana!
No head to hit!
I'll find you, Baron!
And then I kill you!
Fetch me my radish club!
Faster!
I make a baron brochette! Sybil!
Come on! Faster!
But he can't! Berthold can hardly move!
Take his weights off.
- I have!
- What?
- He's old! He can't run anymore.
- Nonsense!
He's just out of practice.
Come on, Berthold!
Look for him!
Nowhere to run to!
Nowhere to hide for you, Baron!
What are you looking at?
Look down there!
Come on!
There he is, Sybil.
Down there.
I got you now, Baron!
Wait, Sybil!
Whoa!
Wait! There they are!
Are you hungry, my darling?
All right. You take the baron.
You take the bald one.
And for you, my sweet... the little girl because you're my favorite.
All right! Dinner is served!
- Teamwork, Sybil!
- You go that way. I'll go this way.
- You're the last of your species!
- Go on!
Work with me! Stay together!
No, girls! Don't split up on me now!
Mayday!
We're going down! Mayday!
Sybil! Don't desert me now!
I love you!
I'm free!
I'm free at last!
The body is dead!
The body is dead! Long live the head!
It's finished!
Bye, body!
I shall prove a head does not need a body to survive!
I am omnipotent!
Yes! Oh, no! I got an itch.
Well done, Sally!
Thanks!
How great to see you!
What are you doing here?
- Get off me!
- It's me!
Berthold, your old servant! Remember?
- Yes! We've been through all that.
- Where are we?
On the Moon.
Oh, yeah. Same old baron!
- Can we go now?
- Get weaving.
Hang on.
It's all coming back.
I've been stuck here for over 20 years!
Ever since you were last here on the moon!
You abandoned me here!
You swine!
You toddled off with that old queen of tarts... and left me to rot in that parrot cage, didn't you?
And now you come back, just because it suits you... after wasting half my life... and expect me to follow you to the ends of the Earth!
Yes!
All right.
Do you know where the rest of the gang are?
Not a clue.
This is precisely the sort of thing that no one ever believes.
Right, Berthold.
You go first.
Then Sally.
Careful.
Off you go.
That's it!
There's no more rope.
- Mind now. I'm going back up.
- Wait a moment.
Here! Tie this to the end of it.
Where'd you get this?
I cut it from the top.
Naturally!
Where else would I get it?
- But...
- Yes, yes!
Splice it to the ends so that we may continue our descent.
Very clever. Great.
Why didn't I think of that?
That's why he's a baron and I'm a prole.
We'll never rescue them now!
21/2% on the basic rate!
- That's not enough!
- That's what I got to offer!
And a separate agreement for overtime!
Six percent!
21/2%! Take it or leave it!
Five percent or no increased production!
We want more!
I'm still in one piece!
- I think.
- I can't imagine why.
Our descent, in what I take to be the volcano of Mount Etna... should have been slowed by a rising cushion of warm air.
Damn thing seems to have gone out.
Oh, no! Not more giants!
Can I help you tiny mortals?
I sincerely hope so.
I'm Baron Munchausen.
You may have heard of me.
My friends and I are looking for three men:
One with exceptional eyesight.
One with superb hearing and powerful lungs.
One who is extremely large and strong.
We're all extremely large and strong here!
I am Vulcan, the god.
And these... are my giant employees... the cyclops... who even now are going back to work!
Go slow!
I'm willing to supply arms and equipment to anyone prepared to pay the price!
Greeks, Trojans, Romans, Huns.
It's not my fault if they're crazy enough to slaughter each other!
You mankey crew!
You go-slowers don't impress me!
I'm God.
I've got all the time in the universe!
You hear that?
All the time! Me!
You know, in the old days... the staff used to get paid on the dot every thousand years.
This lot expect them every century.
That is outrageous!
What's this?
This is our prototype.
RX Intercontinental...
Radar Sneaky...
Multiwarheaded Nuclear Missile.
- What does it do?
- Do?
Kills the enemy.
- All the enemy?
- Aye. All of them.
All their wives, children, sheep, cattle.
And all their cats and dogs.
All of them gone for good.
That's horrible!
Well, you see, the advantage is... you don't have to see one single one of them die.
You just sit comfortably... thousands of miles away from the battlefield... and simply press the button.
Well, where's the fun in that?
We cater to all sorts here.
You'd be surprised.
Would you care for a little fodder, perhaps?
- Delicious!
- It's not a bad drop of tea... as far as nectar of the gods go.
You can stay as long as you like.
It's nice to have company for tea.
Thank you. It'll be a pleasure.
I'm sorry, but we have to go soon.
We're in a hurry.
Here comes my midget manservant... with the petit fours.
Albrecht!
- Berthold! What are you doing here?
- Looking for you!
I haven't got the treasure anymore!
I spent it!
I mean, I gave it all to charity.
I don't want the treasure.
Albrecht, this is Sally.
Sally, Albrecht.
Hello.
I want you to help us fight the Turk again.
No. I couldn't do that.
Not since I found myself.
I never really wanted to be big and strong... and lug heavy things about.
I now know I want to be dainty and sensitive.
They call me their midget down here.
I love it. It's bliss.
He's gone funny.
Hello.
My darling.
My dearest.
Excuse me. May I introduce you to Baron Munchausen... and his little friend over there...
Sally.
And Berthold.
This is Venus.
The goddess.
My wife.
Madam.
I am overwhelmed.
Oh, my love!
My life.
The alpha and the omega of my existence.
I've got something here for you.
A diamond.
For you, my precious.
You're so sweet.
Another diamond.
Madam...
I am, alas, unable to offer you so splendid a gift.
But allow me to say that you excel in beauty... even the magnificent
Catherine the Great of Russia...
Here we go.
Who's hand in marriage
I once had the honor of declining.
- Baron, you flatter me.
- Not one jot, madam.
Not one tittle.
What a handsome... moustache.
Shall we dance?
Come and see the ballroom.
Nice, isn't it?
We've just had it done!
You know that?
I can dance.
Here. Watch this.
Sally, you can dance, can't you?
No.
Thanks a lot!
Stop!
Can we go now?
Hello!
Stop it! Come down!
We've got to get back!
We've got to get back and save the town!
Please, Baron!
Please!
Don't fret!
The town is in no immediate danger.
The baron's kissing your wife.
What?
I mean... What?
You're a harlot!
Whore! Did you hear? Whore!
That's enough of that!
You stop it!
Wait. Please!
- But darling!
- Don't you "darling" me!
Do something! Save him!
Darling, don't be jealous!
Jealous! I'm not jealous!
- Give him back to me!
- Excuse me.
You never let me have any friends!
I won't have you wiggling at philanderers, you floozy!
- Sir, I must assure you...
- Floozy!
I am a goddess!
I can do what I like!
And I am the god, so shut up!
- Excuse me...
- Put him down, you brute!
- Ungrateful mortal!
- Please don't!
You'll pay for this!
- You hear me?
- I insist that the lady is blameless.
Please! Put the baron down!
- Let's not be too hasty!
- He's always like that!
- What have you done to them?
- You small-minded, petty, bourgeoise...
Shut up, you trollop!
- What have you done to the baron?
- You want the baron?
You can have the baron!
No, thanks. It's okay!
I don't need him!
Did you enjoy that?
Did I... excite you?
I can't swim!
What's happening?
You've got old again.
What do you expect?
I've just been expelled from a state of bliss.
- It's all your fault!
- Where are we?
Answer me!
The most probable explanation... if you're not a sceptic... is we've dropped through the center of the world and come out the other side... somewhere in the South Seas.
That's miles away.
Oh! Well done.
- I was happy in my volcano.
- So was I.
Look! An island!
- Is there a volcano in it?
- Shut up about your poxy volcano!
I think there is a volcano on it.
It's moving!
I spy with my little eye... something beginning with "M."
It's the demon of the deep!
That begins with "D," you klutz!
It's "M" for monster!
Will it eat us?
With any luck.
Baron!
Give me a hand.
He looks dead to me.
He can't be dead!
Go ahead.
Let's put him there.
He doesn't look very perky, does he?
Is there a doctor in the fish?
No doctors.
We've got to get him warm and dry.
What's that noise?
It's music.
That's not music.
Look!
There's a light.
Come on!
This way.
Careful.
Once I had a sweetheart
A sweetheart, once I had
She was the truest
Excuse me!
Hello!
We need some help.
Excuse me!
- We need some help.
- No doctors.
Once I had a sweetheart
Do I hear the baron?
Eh?
Do I hear the baron?
No doctors.
Do I hear the baron?
I just said that!
Use your trumpet!
Adolphus! Gustavus!
Is it really you?
Baron! Berthold!
- Albrecht!
- I don't believe it!
It's Berthold!
Sally, this is Adolphus, who used to be able to hit a bull's eye... from halfway 'round the world.
And this is Gustavus... who could blow over a whole forest with just one breath!
Those were the days! Aye?
When we were young and alive!
How do you mean?
It's no good fighting it.
- We're not dead!
- You have to accept it.
We're all dead here.
This is hell!
- Heaven.
- Hell!
Heaven!
Don't be stupid.
Well, sit down. Relax.
Have a game.
You're dead for a very long time.
Come on. Sit down.
Let's have a nice game.
What are you doing?
You're giving up, aren't you?
You can't give up!
I won't let you!
Go away. Clear off.
What about Rose and Daisy and my father... and all the others?
- You promised to help them!
- They are perfectly safe.
They can look after themselves.
Besides, there are more important things.
Such as?
Well...
You horrible little brat!
Can't you let me die in peace once in a while?
Bucephalus!
My Bucephalus!
You must have heard me shouting.
This is a good omen, what?
Oh, yeah.
Prepare a rowing boat and be ready to leave.
Come on, boy.
I have learned from experience... that a modicum of snuff can be most efficacious.
I'll never eat fish again.
Where's the baron?
Baron, where are you?
It's the baron!
Come on.
I can't keep this up forever!
Look! The town!
We're here!
Look!
The flag's still flying!
I told you there was nothing to worry about.
Fire!
Oh, my God!
It's the sultan's army!
Quick! Back in the fish!
They're inviting us to defeat them.
We must oblige them.
On the count of three!
Gustavus! Blow them back to Asia Minor.
Adolphus, find the sultan and shoot him!
Albrecht, row for the shore!
Berthold, make yourself useful!
One, two, three!
Could you make that four?
We're going down!
Abandon ship!
I think the ship's abandoning us, mate!
Jump!
Attack!
I still can't swim.
- This is absolutely dreadful!
- It's hopeless.
I've never before been in such a disastrous rout!
I'm usually on the winning side!
If you weren't so competitive, you wouldn't get so upset!
Albrecht's useless!
We might as well give up now.
You mustn't say that! Not you!
If we begin attacking in two directions simultaneously... we confound surprise with confusion.
Albrecht and Gustavus will provide the major themes to the battle...
- while Adolphus and...
- Baron.
Don't interrupt. What is it?
This isn't going to work.
- What do you mean?
- They're all old and tired now.
It isn't like it used to be.
Don't you see?
Where are you going?
- To give myself up.
- What?
I gave my word I'd raze the siege and save the town.
I gathered you for that purpose.
If you want to see
Baron Munchausen again... you'd better do something about it.
You can't give yourself up!
They might kill you!
We'll have spent all that time in that smelly fish for nothing.
Well!
So it's agreed.
Friday, the 28th... you surrender... that's three weeks from tomorrow.
We can fix the details later.
- No. You surrender.
- We've been through all this.
- You surrender.
- But we're winning.
- We surrendered last time.
- So?
Now it's your turn.
Oh. What about the virgins?
Please. Forget the virgins.
We're out of virgins.
Let us, instead, concentrate on reaching a rational... sensible, civilized agreement... which will guarantee a world fit for science, progress and...
But not Baron Munchausen!
- You! You old lunatic!
- I'm afraid so.
Help! Guards! Murder!
- Who let this man into my tent?
- Sultan!
If you are still interested in my head, it's yours.
I'm tired of it.
Send for the executioner!
So, Mr. Jackson.
Still the rational man?
How many people have perished in your logical little war?
There are certain rules to the proper conduct of living.
We cannot fly to the moon.
We cannot defy death.
We must face the facts.
Not the folly of fantasists like you who don't live in the real world... and who consequently come to a very sticky end.
Have you any famous last words?
Not yet.
"Not yet"?
Is that famous?
The man's a buffoon.
Executioner... execute.
Now!
He did it!
Bring him back!
- Stop that man!
- Hey!
I knew we could do it!
All together now!
Steady!
Well blown, Gustavus!
- They're coming!
- Go on!
Hurry!
Quickly now!
Come on!
Berthold, run!
Damn it, man! Make yourself useful!
I can't do everything!
- This way!
- Careful!
That's the way.
Watch it!
Gently this time.
Gently.
Help!
We did it!
Hurray!
Look! They don't believe it!
We've won!
We beat them!
Yipee! Thank God!
- Good riddance! And don't come back!
- We won!
But of course!
We won! Oh, the joy!
Get me down!
Oh, my goodness!
- In the church tower!
- He's dying!
- There he is!
- Shoot him!
Oh! Damn!
Bring a doctor! Quickly!
Fetch a doctor!
Don't leave me, Baron. Please!
- Don't leave me!
- Get off him! Give him some air!
- Here is a doctor.
- Sally!
Take care of Sally.
No doctors.
- Get away!
- Stop!
Leave him alone!
- She's having a fit!
- Go away!
Stop it!
He's dead.
And that was only one of the many occasions where I met my death.
An experience which I don't hesitate strongly... to recommend.
And so, with the help of my inestimable servants...
I defeated the Turks and saved the day.
And from that time forth... everyone who had a talent for it... lived happily ever after.
Stop this nonsense at once!
You, sir, are under arrest... for spreading ridiculous tales at a time of great danger.
When the enemy is at the gate.
Arrest him.
Open the gates.
I order you to arrest that man at once!
Am I or am I not the elected representative?
- Arrest him!
- Open the gates!
This way!
Come on!
Do not open the gate!
The Turk is outside, and we are not about to surrender.
Open the gates!
Come on, dear ladies!
Forward, the players!
Do not open the gate!
Keep up! Steady as you go.
Get back! I'm warning you!
Do not open those gates!
- This way!
- Anyone who opens those gates... is guilty of treason!
Follow me!
This way, my friends!
The gates will remain closed.
Open the gates!
- Shoot anyone who disobeys my orders!
- Ready!
Aim!
Hold your ground!
Open the gates, dear friends... and let's seize the day!
Or close our minds up with inventions, death and fear.
There's nothing so destroys a man... as ignorance and conformity!
Grasp for the mantle!
- Grasp the...
- No!
Quite wrong!
Open the gates!
Shoot them!
Shoot these people at once!
Aye! So! It's treason, is it?
Treason!
Right!
You're all under arrest!
All of you!
This is all your fault!
Get inside my office now!
Cheers for the baron!
Hooray!
My Bucephalus.
Good boy.
Come on.
Beautiful ladies.
It wasn't just a story, was it?
Here, you can take this ticket!
You can have this ticket and keep it! I'm not paying that ticket!
Jesus! Why don't you watch where you're going!
Then I want you to go downstairs to the cellar and check the water under the boiler.
I wanna do that today, all right!
- Could you do that?
- Would you mind giving me a hand?
I ain't the doorman, Ms. Barrett,
I'm the building superintendent.
You're also a human being.
It's not my job, but what the hell, I'll do you a favor.
Listen, when are you gonna get around to fixing the radiator in the baby's room?
- You know, I asked you last week.
- Didn't I do that?
Well, it's getting really cold in there. I...
Okay, well, it's no problem.
Hey!
Hey, stop that carriage!
- Get it!
- Stop!
That's my baby!
Watch out!
Jesus!
Oscar, watch out!
My God!
Please!
Stop that carriage!

Look, that's it. I've had it, Ray.
- No more parties.
- Here's your share.
Look, I'm tired of taking abuse from overprivileged 9-year-olds.
I know, Z, but we can't quit now.
The holidays are coming up.
- It's our best season.
- Ray.
Man, face it. Ghostbusters doesn't exist.
A year from now, those kids won't even remember who we are.
Ungrateful little yuppie larvae.
After all we did for this city.
Yeah, we conjured up a
100-foot marshmallow man, blew the top three floors off an uptown high-rise, ended up getting sued by every state, county and city agency in New York.
Yeah, but what a ride. right out into the middle of traffic and I started really running after it.
And then it just suddenly stopped, right in the middle of the street.
Mm-hm. And did anyone else see this happen?
Well, sure, hundreds of people.
- Egon, I didn't imagine this.
- I'm not saying you did.
It's just in science, we always look for the simplest explanation.
- We're ready, Dr. Spengler.
- Good.
We'll start with the negative calibration.
- What are you working on, Egon?
- Trying to determine whether human emotions actually affect the physical environment.
It's a theory Ray and I had when we were still Ghostbusters.
Can they see us?
No. They think they're here for marriage counseling.
We kept them waiting for two and a half hours.
I've been gradually increasing the temperature in the room.
It's up to 95 degrees at the moment.
Now my assistant has asked them if they'd mind waiting another half-hour.
Oh, good. Very good.
Very, very nice.
- So, Egon, what do you think?
- Excellent. Just excellent.
Do the happiness index next.
I mean about the carriage.
Well, I'd like to bring Ray in on this, if you don't mind.
Sure. Whatever you think.
But not Venkman.
Oh, no.
- Do you ever see him?
- Occasionally.
- Peter?
- How is he these days?
Well, he was borderline for a while.
Then he crossed the border.
Does he ever mention me?
No.
Oh. Well, we... We didn't part on very good terms.
And then we sort of lost track of each other after I got married.
- We're ready for the affection test.
- Good, send in the puppy, please.
I thought of getting in touch with him after my marriage ended, but...
Oh.
Isn't that sweet?
I appreciate your doing this.
Try not to worry.
Here's my phone number.
You'll call me?
Yes.
I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter, if you don't mind.
No, I won't. I won't.
Thanks.
Let's see what happens when we take away the puppy.
This... Gee, I don't know... father encouraged...
Hi. Welcome back to
World of the Psychic.
I'm Peter Venkman.
I'm chatting with my guest.
Author, lecturer and psychic,
Milton Angland. Milt, your new book is called The End of the World.
Now, can you tell us when it's gonna be, or do we have to buy the book?
Well, I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
- This year?
- Mm-hm.
Well, that's cutting it a little bit close, isn't it? I mean...
Just from a sales point of view,
I mean, your book is just coming out, you're not gonna see any paperback sales for at least a year.
It'll be at least another year before you know whether you've got the mini-series or Movie of the Week kind of possibilities.
Just devil's advocate, Milty.
I mean, shouldn't you have said,
"Hey, the world's gonna end in 1992"?
- Wait a minute. This is...
- Or better yet, 1994.
This is not just some money-making scheme, all right?
I have a strong psychic belief... that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
- For your sake, I hope you're right.
- Thank you.
Okay, but I think my other guest may disagree with you.
Elaine.
Now, you had another date in mind.
According to my source, the end of the world will be on
February 14th in the year 2016.
Valentine's Day.
Bummer.
Where'd you get your date, Elaine?
I received this information from an alien.
As I told my husband, it was in the Paramus Holiday Inn.
I was having a drink at the bar, alone, and this alien approached me.
He started talking to me.
He bought me a drink.
And then I think he must have used some kind of a ray or a mind-control device, because he forced me to follow him to his room.
And that's where... he told me about the end of the world.
So your alien had a room at the Holiday Inn, Paramus?
It might've been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room at the Holiday Inn.
I can't be sure about that, Peter.
Of course not. And that is the whole problem with aliens, is you just can't trust them.
Occasionally you meet a nice one: Starman, E.T.
But usually they turn out to be some kind of big lizard!
That's all the time we've got for this week on World of the Psychic.
Next week, though...
Give me Ira. Hairless pets.
Weird. Until then, this is Peter Venkman, saying:
See you then. Bye.
Norman, where do you find these people?
Weren't we supposed to have the telekinetic guy who bends the spoons?
He canceled. This is the best we could do at such short notice.
Look, no respected psychic will come on the show.
- They think you're a fraud.
- I am a fraud.
Mr. Mayor. Lenny. Lenny!
- Pete Venkman.
- Can I help you?
Yeah, get your hand off me.
Thank you, I'm an old friend of the mayor's.
I wanna say hello, give him a kiss.
I'm Jack Hardemeyer, I'm the mayor's assistant.
I know who you are, Dr. Venkman.
I just don't see any ghosts anywhere.
That's why I wanted to talk to His Highness.
See, we did a little job for the city a while back and we got stiffed on the bill by some bureaucratic bookworm like yourself.
Look, you stay away from the mayor.
He's running for governor next fall.
And the last thing we need is for him to be associated with two-bit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends.
You know, I'm a voter.
Aren't you supposed to lie to me and kiss my butt?
All right, yes. Now, I want you to put the Vigo in the arch.
Under the arch there.
Everything you're doing is bad.
I want you to know this.
You be careful there, all right?
No one listens to me.
Well, Dana, how are you doing?
- How's this Bonington coming?
- It's coming along fine.
This mixture you gave me is working really well.
Yes? Well, I make pretty good cocktails, don't I?
Yes, you're doing really
- quite good work there.
- Thank you.
It won't be long before you can assist me in... more important restoration.
Just a... A white thing.
Well, thank you, Dr. Poha.
- Janosz.
- Janosz.
Um, I've enjoyed working here, but now that my baby's a little older, I'm gonna try to go back to the orchestra.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that you will not... Be not here.
Well, could I say goodbye?
You know, maybe bring you to a brunch today?
Well, I can't today, I have an appointment. In fact, I'd better go.
I don't understand this. You know, every day I say, "Can you do something?"
You say, "No, I can't do something."
- Do I have bad breath or something?
- Of course not.
All right. Well, I'll give you a rain check.
I think that she likes me.
No, I do. I truly do.
This one's interesting,
Ray. Berlin, 1939.
A flower cart took off by itself, rolled half a kilometer.
- Three hundred eyewitnesses.
- My best to the coven.
Berlin, huh? You know, you should also check Duke University studies on controlled psychokinesis.
- I pulled it.
- Perhaps you could you help me,
I'm looking for a love-potion aerosol that I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet to obtain her total submission.
- Hello, Venkman.
- Hi, Pete. How's it going?
Very well. Hi, Egon. How's school?
I bet those science chicks really dig that large cranium of yours, huh?
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
Ray, let's close this place up so you can buy me a calzone.
I really can't do that right now,
Pete. I'm working on something.
But your book came in.
- Magical Paths to Fortune and Power.
- Thank you.
Good luck with that, Venkman.
- Put this on my account, please?
- Sure.
- Ray, take a look at this.
- Oh, yeah.
What are you guys working on?
- Uh, well, we're just kind of...
- Ahem. checking something out for an old friend.
Neat. Who?
Um...
Ray's Occult.
Seven o'clock on weekdays, midnight on Saturdays.
Thank you.
- Who?
- Who?
- Just someone we know.
- Oh.
Who?
- I can't! No! No! No!
- Yes, you can. Who?
- Nobody! Nobody!
- Can you tell me now?
- I can't!
- Now?
Dana Barrett!
Ow.
My Dana Barrett?
I'll get it.
- Hi, Dana.
- Hi, Ray.
How good to see you.
Thanks for coming.
Hey, no problem. Always glad to help. And hug.
- Hello, Dana.
- Hi, Egon.
Nice place.
Well, I know I'm just asking for the big hurt but I thought I'd give us one more chance.
He tortured me. He pulled my ears.
Hello, Peter.
Hello, Dana.
- So, what would you like to do first?
- We'd like to examine the baby.
Yeah, and anything associated with the baby, especially stuffed toys.
- Then we'd like to see the buggy.
- All right. Can I put him here?
- And wherever he sleeps.
- Yes.
- This'll be fine.
- This okay?
- That's fine.
- Okay.
We'll have to lay him down flat.
Okay, sweetheart, now they're gonna take a look at you.
We'll do a cursory medical examination.
What do you say? Gammel and
Pross Infant Acuity Test?
Sounds good. We'll finish with an Apgar score.
It's nothing that's gonna hurt him, right?
No. No, I don't think so.
He'll be fine.
- You ever done this before?
- On a chimp.
So whatever happened to Mr. Right, anyway?
I heard he ditched you and ran off to Europe.
He didn't ditch me.
We had some problems and he got a very good job offer from an orchestra in London and he took it.
So he ditched you.
Okay. Subject is a male Caucasian,
- approximately...
- Twenty four inches.
Twenty-four inches in length.
Subject weighs approximately 18 pounds and is about 8 months old.
Okay. Ocular?
Pupillary response normal.
Auditory.
- Appears normal.
- Apillary reflex.
- Appears to be ticklish.
- Yep. Baby ticklish.
You know, you'd have been better off marrying me.
You never asked me.
And whenever I brought it up, you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
You never got it, Dana.
I'm a man. I'm sensitive.
I need to feel loved.
I need to be desired.
It was when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain."
That's when I left.
Well, I may have a lot of personal problems, but I'm a total professional when it comes to my job.
- Hey, Egon.
- What?
- What are we doing?
- He seems to be fine, Dana.
- Mm-hm. He's very healthy.
- He's okay.
When he does sleep, where do you put him?
Right around here. I'll show you.
Venkman, would you get a stool specimen, please?
Business or personal?
It's a little messy.
Well, we don't wanna play with anything, we just wanna sweep for valences.
Mm. Very cheerful.
My parents didn't believe in toys.
You wanna play with a big kid?
You know, I should have been your father.
I mean, I could have been.
I understand.
Help! He's gone completely berserk. Help!
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.
You mean you never even had a Slinky?
We had part of a Slinky.
But I straightened it.
Help! Help!
He...
He had some sort of clear liquid coming out of his mouth.
Yeah, well, that happens.
Well, what do you think?
Well, he's ugly.
I mean, he's not Elephant Man ugly, but he's not attractive.
Was his father ugly?
- Don't listen.
- And he stinks.
You're ripe, señor.
Did his father stink?
Yeah. Daddy was a smelly, huh?
- What's your name?
- His name is Oscar.
Named after a hot dog.
You poor man.
You poor, poor man.
But seriously, there's nothing... unusual about him, is there?
Well, I don't have a lot of experience with babies.
But you're excited now, because Mama's here to get your stool sample. Right, Mama?
- Stool sample?
- Yeah.
- Nothing.
- So, what, brainiac?
I'd like to run some gynaecological tests on the mother.
- Who wouldn't?
- Let's check the street.
It stopped right over there,
- in the middle of the crosswalk.
- All right, I can get us out there.
- Hey. Venkman.
- Hold on.
We're scientists, excuse us.
Get out of the way!
Thanks a lot. We gotta do an inquiry here.
Hold on. Thanks. Appreciate it.
Thanks.
You gonna move out of there or what?
Relax, you're on the meter. Come on, hey!
We're scientists, get out of the way.
I think we hit the honeypot.
There's something brewing under the street. I've got 1118 on the PKE.
Two-point-five GEVs on the gigameter.
Well, what does that mean?
Hey! How you doing?
- Me?
- Yeah.
- Fine. Fine. It's cutting fine now.
- Great.
Why are you cutting?
Why am I cutting?
- Yeah.
- Boss!
Who told you to stop cutting?
- Somebody tell you to stop...?
- What're you guys doing here?
Did you tell him to stop cutting?
Yes, I told him to stop.
What are you doing?
What's it look like we're doing here? Why don't you let us work? We let you work.
Hey, take it easy. He's been working overtime. I tell you why we're here.
We're here because some diaper bag downtown is being a jerk and making us work on a Friday night. Am I right, Peter?
Of course you're right,
Raymond. Is he right, Ziggy?
Yo.
- You guys take it easy, all right?
- Come on. Come on.
What have you been doing?
What have I been doing? While you were getting coffee for an hour,
I've been digging a big hole in the middle of the street.
Looks like you uncovered an old air shaft.
Man, that just goes on and on.
This is very intense. We should get a deeper reading.
Yeah. We're gonna need a deeper reading.
Yeah, somebody has to go down there.
Yeah, somebody's gotta go down there.
Stinging! I'm stinging!
Listen to me.
What? Who?
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
Oh, command me, lord.
On a mountain of skulls in the castle of pain
I sat on a throne of blood.
What was, will be.
What is, will be no more.
Now is the season of evil.
Evil?
Find me a child, that
I might live again.
Yes. A child.
A child. A child?
A child.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm good.
The speed's good, boys.
Keep it coming.
We're breaking through.
I see some light.
I'm in some kind of a chamber.
There's tile work.
- Slime!
- What?
It's a river of slime!
There's gotta be 25,000 gallons of it.
It's flowing through here like a river.
Van Horne. Pneumatic transit. I can't believe it.
It's the old pneumatic transit system, it's still here.
Okay. That's good.
Hold me up. That's good.
What do you see?
All right. Let's see if I can get a sample.
What's going on here?
Hey, what's the story?
Hey, what, you boneheads are gonna come and roust me out again?
I got 3000 phones out in Greenwich Village.
I got about 8 million miles of cable I gotta check.
You gonna come shake my monkey tree again?!
What are you talking about, buddy?
The phone lines are over there.
What did I say to you? The phone lines are over there.
- What did I say? How many times?
- Hey! Hey!
Hey, you're not with Con Ed or the phone company. We checked.
So tell me another one.
I've got a major gas leak here!
Where do you think all this is coming from, the sky?
Okay, boys.
Boys?
Pull me up now, all right?
There's some kind of activity going on with this stuff.
Boys? Hey, help!
- Take me up!
- Ray!
Start it! Start it!
Boys? Hey, what's going on up there?
Come on! Get me out of this hole!
Sweetie.
Hello.
Go back to sleep, darling.
- Who is it?
- It's Janosz.
Janosz.
Hello, Janosz.
- This is a surprise.
- Oh, hello.
Uh, yes. Well, I happened to be here in this neighborhood and I thought that I would stop by to see how is it with you.
Yeah, because of all this blackness, it was.
- We're fine. Thank you. Thank...
- Well, then, you're okay?
- How's the baby?
- He's okay. Yes.
Whoo.
- He's sleeping.
- Oh, but I "woo"-ed.
- That's okay.
- All right, and do you need anything? You know?
Do you want me to come in?
- No, thank you.
- All right.
Just thought that I would check. You know.
Well, hey, you. Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Good night, Janosz.
Before we begin this trial, I want to make one thing very clear.
The law does not recognize the existence of ghosts and I don't believe in them either.
I don't want to hear a lot of malarkey about goblins, spooks and demons.
We're gonna stick to the facts in this case and leave the ghost stories to the kiddies, understood?
Wow, sounds like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
Yeah, they call him "The Hammer."
What can we do? It's all in the hands of our lawyer now.
I think you guys are making a big mistake.
I do mostly tax law and some probate stuff occasionally.
I got my law degree at night school.
Well, that's fine, Louis.
We got arrested at night.
Look, just put these guys away fast and make sure they go away for a long, long time, okay?
I don't think it's gonna be hard, with this list of charges.
Good. Very good.
Violating a judicial restraining order, willful destruction of public property, fraud, malicious mischief.
See you in a couple of years, at your first parole hearing.
You'll never take us alive.
All right, all right.
Let's get on with it.
Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of the audience,
I don't think it's fair to call my clients frauds.
Okay, so the blackout was a big problem for everybody, okay?
I was stuck in an elevator for two hours and I had to make the whole time.
But I don't blame them.
Because one time I turned into a dog and they helped me. Thank you.
Very good, Louis.
Short but pointless.
Mr. Fianella, please look at exhibits A through
F on the table over here.
Do you recognize this equipment?
Yeah, that's the stuff the cops took from their truck.
Do you know what this equipment is used for?
I don't know. Catching ghosts, maybe? I don't know.
May I remind the court the defendants are under a judicial restraining order that strictly forbids them from performing services as paranormal investigators or eliminators.
So noted.
Now, Mr. Fianella, can you identify the substance in this jar marked "Exhibit F"?
Yeah. Yeah, that's the stuff, all right.
Your Honor, I've been working underground for Con Ed for 27 years.
I never saw anything like this in my life.
Whatever's down there, they must've put it there.
- No, we didn't!
- Ray, Ray.
Shut up!
- So you were just trying to help...
- Help out a friend.
- Who was frightened.
- Who was scared.
And when you're scared... What?
- There was no evil...
- No evil was intended. No malice.
When you live in a place and you love it like you do, you don't want nothing bad to happen.
- What?
- It was a one-shot...
Because it'll never happen again. It's an isolated incident, it's a one-shot deal.
- Objection, Your Honor.
- What?
- He's leading the witness.
- Sustained.
Give me a break.
We're both lawyers.
Mr. Tully, do you have any questions for this witness that might have some bearing on this case?
- Do I?
- No, we've helped them out enough.
No, Your Honor.
Your witness.
Dr. Venkman... would you please tell the court why it is that you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a very big hole in the middle of First Avenue.
Well, there's so many holes in First Avenue we really didn't think anyone would notice.
Keep that up, mister,
I'll find you in contempt.
I'm truly sorry, Your Honor.
I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman, why were you digging the hole?
And please remember you're under oath.
There are some things in this world that go way beyond human understanding.
Things that cannot be explained, things that most people don't wanna know about.
That is where we come in.
So what you're saying is that the world of the supernatural is your exclusive province?
Kitten, I think what
I'm saying is that sometimes shit happens, someone has to deal with it, and who you gonna call?
Shut up!
Peter Venkman, Raymond Stantz,
Egon Spengler, stand up!
Get up!
You too, Mr. Tully.
I find you guilty on all charges.
I order you to pay fines in the amount of $25,000 each.
I sentence you to 18 months at the city correctional facility at Riker's Island.
Egie, she's twitching.
I'm not finished!
On a more personal note, let me just go on record as saying that there's no place for fakes, charlatans...
- Uh, your Honor...
- Shut up!
- Tricksters like you in decent society.
- Your Honor, this is important.
You play on the gullibility of innocent people.
- Yes, sir.
- Be quiet!
- But...
- If my hands weren't tied by the unalterable fetters of the law then I would invoke the tradition of our illustrious forebears, reach back to a purer, sterner justice and have you burned at the stake!
Wow.
Oh, my God, the Scoleri brothers.
- The Scoleri brothers!
- Friends of yours?
I tried them for murder!
Gave them the chair!
You gotta do something!
Why don't you just tell them you don't believe in ghosts.
You gotta do something. Help me!
Don't talk to me.
Talk to my attorney.
That's me! My guys are still under a judicial misstrangement order.
That blue thing I got from her.
They could be exposing themselves.
And you don't want us exposing ourselves.
- You're next, Bubbles.
- All right! I rescind the order!
- Case dismissed!
- Hurray! We won the case!
Now, do something!
I always hated this part of the business.
You know, it's been a couple years since we used this stuff.
- I hope it still works.
- It should.
Power cells have a half-life of 5000 years.
There's no time for a bench test.
Heat them up.
- Do...
- Re...
Egon!
Whoa.
You got him, Venkman!
Hold him! Steady.
Come on, big boy. I'm gonna take you home to my private zoo.
You got him. You got him!
- Egie, bring the trap.
- Okay, okay.
Behind you, Ray!
Hold him, Ray!
Venkman, start bringing him back!
Come on, you big meanie.
Let's go, chubby.
Ray, keep pulling him to the right.
Okay, the trap's going in.
No, no, Spengie!
- Hold it, Ray!
- Hit it!
- Two in the box!
- Ready to go!
- We be fast.
- And they be slow!
Wow.
We're the best! We're the beautiful! We're the only
- Ghostbusters.
- We're back!

Yes, we're back.

We've been experimenting with the plasm we found in the subway tunnel.
Careful.
- Should I get spoons?
- Don't bother. Watch this.
Try it, Ray.
You! You worthless piece of slime!
You ignorant, disgusting blob.
You're nothing but an unstable short-chain molecule!
You foul, obnoxious muck!
You have a weak electrochemical bond!
I have seen some disgusting crud in my time but you take the cake.
- You're a... You're just...
- Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is what you do with your spare time?
Peter, this is an incredible breakthrough.
What a discovery.
A psycho-reactive substance.
Whatever this stuff is, it responds to human emotional states.
Mood slime.
Oh, baby.
You mean this stuff actually feeds on bad vibes.
Like a cop in a doughnut factory.
We've been running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
What kind of tests?
Well, we sing to it and we talk to it and say supportive, nurturing things to it.
You're not sleeping with it, are you, Ray?
Oh, you.
- It's always the quiet ones.
- You hound.
- Ahem. How about the kinetic tests?
- Okay.
Ordinary household toaster.
We'll take your word for that.
It responds to music, so we've been doing some experimentation, playing easy listening.
Middle-of-the-road-type stuff.
You know, Paul Young, "Dust in the Wind." That works okay.
- Works for me.
- Loves Jackie Wilson.
Jeez. You guys do this at night when I'm not here?
Oh, I get it. It sings. It sounds exactly like Jackie.

Oh, did you ever go for it!

Hello. I'm looking for Dana Barrett.
- Room 304, restoration.
- Thank you.
Hey, Dr. Venkman!
World of the Psychic.
- That's right. How you doing?
- I'm a big, big fan of yours.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
It used to be one of my two favorite shows.
You're kidding me. Well, great.
What was the other one?
- Bass Masters. It's a fishing show.
- Yeah, I know Bass Masters. Sure.
You're good, pretty eyes.
I didn't paint it.
I'm just cleaning it.
- It's a Gauguin.
- Oh, I've heard of him.
Hey, Dana. Aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
Sure. Peter Venkman, this is Dr. Janosz Poha, the head of our department.
Yes, I have, of course, have seen you on the television.
Quite enjoy. You're not here on business, I hope?
Well, it's top-secret. Say,
Johnny, you got a Gauguin too.
No. Actually, I'm preparing this portrait for the new Romantic exhibition.
Yes. This is Prince Vigo, the ruler of Carpathia and Moldavia.
Bit of a sissy, isn't he?
He was a very powerful magician, Dr. Venkman.
And a genius in many ways.
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman.
I hate this painting.
I've felt uncomfortable ever since it came up from storage.
Well, you're probably feeling what Vigo is feeling:
Carpathian kitten loss.
He's missed his kitten.
We'll just put one in here by the castle.
We don't go around altering valuable artwork, Dr. Venkman.
Go. Yes, I think, go.
Yes, the joyfulness is over.
He's kidding.
Well, you're not gonna get a green card with that attitude, pal. Okay?
I don't know what to...
Oh, of course. Of course.
I get it. You're sweet on this hunky stud, aren't you?
You know, Peter, every now and then I get the feeling that painting is watching me, even smiling at me.
You know, I think we got more food on your shirt than we did in your mouth.
Okay.
Bath. You get to take a bath, don't you?
Yes, do your favorite thing.
Because I know what you get to do.
You know what you get to do?
Do you know what's more fun than anything? Huh?
Splash Mommy.
"I get to splash Mommy." Yes.
We'll be ready in just a moment.
Mommy's gonna take her shirt off too.
No! No!
Peter, it's me. Please let us in.
What the hell is this?
Peter, let us in, please.
I didn't know where else to go.
The most awful thing happened.
The bathtub... The bathtub was trying to eat Oscar.
I was giving him a bath. There was all this pink ooze everywhere
- and it was reaching for him.
- Okay, you're all right.
I'm not gonna let them get you.
- All right. You're all safe now, okay?
- I was so terrified.
- Yes, darling. I'm so sorry.
- You guys just sit down. Relax.
Come on. Just sit down. I'll get you guys a shirt or something. Hold on.
Ray. Yeah, Dana's just come over to my place.
Well, actually, her tub tried to eat her.
What? Are you serious?
Well, that's great!
I mean, that's terrible.
But it's great for what we...
Yeah, I will.
Yeah, sure, we'll get right on it.
Spengler. A major slime-related psychokinetic event.
- What happened?
- Something came out of Dana's bathtub.
- Tried to grab her and the baby.
- Are they all right?
- She got out and went to Venkman's.
- This is interesting, Ray.
Remember the painting
Venkman mentioned?
I ran "Vigo the Carpathian" through the occult reference net.
Look what came up.
Ooh. Nice ugly history.
You think there's a connection between this Vigo character and the... slime?
Is the atomic weight of cobalt 58.9?
We better get over to Dana's apartment.
I'd like to check out that bathtub.
It might be a good idea to go to the museum in the morning, get a look at that painting.
Ray's gonna go on over to your place and just take a look.
- He is?
- Okay.
I have been holding on to this for a long time, Oscar.
I got this from a girl who got this from Joe Willie Namath, okay?
We don't know how.
We don't wanna know.
So I would appreciate it if you would not hose this thing down, you know, give it your own personal rinse. Thank you.
Be an excellent time for you to start practicing a thing we big guys like to call self-control.
Get out of here. Oh, look at him.
Look at him. Oh, look at his gut.
Oh, he's a coconut, this guy.
You're gonna be staying at Uncle
Pete's until this thing blows over.
This is your place now.
Hi.
Come on in. This is my place.
So how are we gonna handle the sleeping arrangements?
Well, what's best for me is if I lie on my side like this and you spoon up beside me, your arm draped over me.
We do it the other way,
I get your hair caught in my throat and I choke in the night.
Well, how about you on the sofa and me and the baby in the bed?
It's a way to go.
It's so late. I really ought to put him down.
- May I?
- Yeah, if you want to.
You're short.
Your belly button sticks out too far.
And you're a terrible burden on your poor mother.
You find anything at Dana's?
Nothing but mood some slime residue around the bathtub.
But I did get something on that
Vigo character you mentioned.
Found it in Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen. Dig that.
Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610.
105 years old. He hung in there, didn't he?
He didn't die of old age, either.
He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disembowelled, drawn and quartered.
Ouch.
- I guess he wasn't too popular.
- Not exactly a man of the people.
Also known as Vigo the
Cruel, Vigo the Torturer,
Vigo the Despised and
Vigo the Unholy.
Wasn't he also Vigo the Butch?
And dig this. There was a prophecy.
Just before his head died, his last words were:
"Death is but a door. Time is but a window. I'll be back."
Let's suck in the guts, guys.
We're the Ghostbusters.
- Go! Go. Please, go. You. Yes, you.
- Who's this wiggler?
- He's yours, Ray. Sic him.
- I have...
Hi, how are you? Ray Stantz from the Ghostbusters. Nice to see you.
Beautiful lab you have here. We're just doing a routine spook check.
Dr. Venkman, Dana is not here.
- Yeah, we know that, Johnny.
- So why are you came?
Well, we got a report there was a major creep in the area.
We checked our list, and you were right on the top.
Johnny, where in the hell are you from, anyway?
The Upper West Side.
The whole room's extremely hot, Peter.
- Ew, that's one ugly dude.
- Hot?
Oh, that's Vigo. Mr. Vigo? Vigs, would you look this way, please?
No, don't. No! No!
No photographs, please.
Slides are available in the gift shop.
Yeah, thanks. Thank you, Winston.
All right. You know what?
Give me angry, will you?
Give me angry. You've had a bad day.
You're cranky. Yeah, thank you.
Good, good. Ooh, angrier.
I'm scared. You're scaring me.
Stop it. Yeah. Good!
Okay, walk for me, talk for me. Yeah, yeah!
Okay, give me hot and sexy.
Can you do it? You can. Oh, boy.
Show me some teeth. Come on.
I bet the girls like you, huh? Do the girls?
Do the guys? Bet they both do, huh?
What about the animals?
They like you? That's it, more!
Yeah, come on! You're big, you're big.
All right, destroy me. Destroy me!
Yeah! Destroy me.
Yeah, yeah! Give it, give it!
Venkman, we need to talk. Come on.
I've worked with better.
But not many. Thank you.
John, thanks.
- Hey. Hey, you finished?
- Yeah, I'm finished here.
- Are you all right?
- What?
I mean, you're not coming down with something?
Me?
Dana. Your prince.
Oh, no.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
She cleaned.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Shh. He's asleep. Come here.
- So what happened with my apartment?
- Well, the guys spent the whole night there.
They went through all your things, your personal stuff, they tried on some of your clothes, made some long-distance phone calls,
- cleaned out the fridge.
- Did they find anything?
They found a little bit of that pink slime.
Oh, God. Well, what am
I supposed to do now?
You are supposed to get dressed and get crazy with me
- on the streets of Manhattan.
- I don't think...
This is exactly what you need.
I have got you a babysitter.
- The whole thing's wired.
- I don't think we should go on a date.
You know, and I can't leave
Oscar in a strange place with a strange person.
Strange person? Janine
Melnitz, from my staff.
Janine has experience babysitting?
Here.
Thank you.
I've also brought some things from your apartment.
Some wardrobe choices. A couple of provocative ensembles in here.
- I'll leave it up to you.
- Okay, but after dinner.
Don't put any of those old cheap moves on me, okay?
- No, no, no.
- It's different.
I have all new cheap moves.
Hey, you. Hey, you.
It looks like you're awake, huh? You're awake.
Yes, Osco.
You're gonna have the whole place to yourself tonight, pal.
It's gonna be pretty neat.
I got some Laura Antonelli tapes if you wanna watch them.
Dana, did you see some shirts here
- in the floor-bed area?
- Yeah, I put them in the hamper.
- I have a hamper?
- Yeah, it's in the bathroom.
Neat.
Will you tell me next time you're gonna do that, though, please?
Well, I thought they were dirty.
I have more than two grades of laundry, okay?
There's not just clean and dirty.
There are many subtle levels, okay?
You hang this outside the window for 20 minutes, it's perfectly fine.
Interesting role model for you, Oscar, huh?
Well, they couldn't get to you until after the New Year.
Well, just don't go in there.
Louis, I'm closing up!
Well, should I take the subway or the surface roads?
- Or what? It's kind of busy...
- Well, I'm walking. Good night.
Well, now. Well, well, hang on, now.
Do you maybe wanna...? No, no.
Do you wanna have something to eat with me?
Well, yeah, I'd love that.
But I told Dr. Venkman
I'd babysit for him.
- Oh, well...
- Do you wanna babysit with me?
- Okay. I would.
- Great. His place at 8.
- Bye.
- His place at 8. All right.
- I can get his address from the W2...
- Hey, buddy. Move it!
We were right, Ray. Multi-planar
Kirlian emanations.
Yeah, well, here's your next month's cover of GQ.
Check out the aura on this sucker.
Now, there's definitely a living presence there.
We should get a deeper look.
Why don't I run this wider shot through the spectral analyzer.
Good, I'll try turning up the roentgens.
So, what do you think? Chinese?
- How about Thai?
- No, it's too spicy.
- Greek?
- Mexican?
- Pizza.
- Thin or thick?
Chicago.
What the hell is that?
I know what it is.
- I've seen it before.
- Where?
When you guys had me dangling like a worm on a hook a hundred feet below First Avenue.
That's the river of slime.
Ray.
We need a blanket or a hose or something.
Get out.
Why is this closed?
Winston! Winston!
- Fire!
- Back away, back away.
What are we gonna do, put our heads in the toilet?
Taxi!
Pete, it's great that you're here.
We've got incredible news.
Wait a minute. Can I have one try?
All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
No. We analyzed the photos you took of Vigo.
The spectrogram shows a river of slime flowing behind him.
Just like the one I saw underground. We're going into the subway and sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the flow.
Yeah, come on. Change your clothes. We'll wait for you.
Yeah, Egon thinks there might even be a tremendous breeding surge
- in the cockroach population.
- Hi, boys. What's up?
Hi.
Dana, the guys are going down into the sewer to check for slime stuff.
And Egon thinks there may even be a huge surge in cockroach breeding.
Wanna blow off this dinner thing and go with them?
Taxi!
Women, huh?
Will you watch your step?
I hate this.
According to this old transit map, there should be an entrance along here somewhere.
I'm not getting anything yet.
Well, at least it's too dark to see the cockroaches.
Forget about cockroaches. It's the subway rats you gotta worry about.
Big as beavers.
Yeah, some of them go 4 or 5 kilos.
Hey, hey. Enough, all right?
Listen. You can hear them behind the walls, scratching. There must be thousands of them.
- Just shut up about the rats.
- Okay, okay.
Hello!
Hey!
Hello!
Winston.
Okay, I'm out of here.
They're gone.
What the...?
Before we go any further, I think we should get our proton packs.
Good idea.
- What's that?
- What's what?
Sounds like a train.
Uh-uh. These lines have been abandoned for 50 years.
Oh.
Probably in one of the tunnels above us.
I don't know.
It sounds awfully close to me.
I think that was the old New
York Central, City of Albany.
Derailed in 1920, killed hundreds of people.
Did you catch the number on the locomotive?
Sorry. I missed it.
Something's trying to stop us. We must be close.
Where's Ray?
- Ray?
- Ray?
- Ray!
- Ray?
- Ray?
- Ray.
Guys!
- What?
- Oh, sorry. I found it.
- Right here. There's a hole.
- Let's go.
Hey, fellas, what about the packs?
What about the packs?
Unbelievable.
Uh-huh. Did I tell you?
I wasn't lying, was I?
You know how much negative energy it must have taken to generate a flow this size?
New York, what a town.
All right. Let's see how deep it is.
- Get a sounding.
- Yeah.
All right, 6 feet.
- Twelve feet.
- Twelve?
- Something's pulling it.
- Hold on!
- Well, I'm trying to hold it.
- Ray, help him.
- Give me a hand. Give me a hand!
- Ray, help.
- It's got ahold of him.
- Get his belt off!
- I can't hold it!
- Wait, wait, hold...
A toast to the most charming,
- kindest...
- Oh, it's me.
It's you. And most unusual man
I've ever broken up with.
Speaking of breaking up with neat guys,
- why did you dump me?
- I didn't dump you. I was protecting myself.
I mean, you weren't very good for me, you know.
You know that, don't you?
Heck, I'm not even good for me.
You're much better than you realize.
You don't give yourself enough credit.
I need to hear that kind of stuff.
If I had this kind of support on a 24-hour-a-day basis,
I could whip myself into shape by the end of this century.
Well, why don't you just give me a jingle in the year 2000.
Why don't I give you a jingle right now?
So the seven little dwarves had a limited partnership in a small mining operation.
And one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.
They bartered housekeeping services for room and board. Which was a real good deal, because they didn't have to withhold social security or income tax or nothing.
Which you're really not supposed to do, you see, but for the purposes of this story...
It really is a great place.
I mean, it needs a woman's touch, but I think it looks really good. You know...
Shh. Bedtime.
You're very good with children.
Thanks. I practiced on my hamster.
So you live alone?
I used to have a roommate, but my mom moved to Florida.
Why don't you come over here and sit with me.
Okay.
So you wanna play Boggle or Super Mario Brothers?
You know...
I think motherhood's a very natural instinct.
I'd like a child myself.
Would you?
Tonight?
Nice going. Ray.
What are you trying to do, drown me?
Oh, Yeah, Zeddmore, like it was my fault.
You were too stupid not to drop that plumb line!
Stupid? You better watch your mouth or I'll punch your lights out.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!
- Well, anytime!
- Come on!
It's go time, man. I want you bad!
Come on!
Wait! Wait!
Stop, stop. Get your clothes off, quick. Strip.
Oh, dear. Ray, what were we doing? I was ready to kill you.
It's this stuff. It's like pure, concentrated evil.
And it's all flowing right to this spot.
- You sure this is it?
- Yeah, he said Armand's.
- Excuse me...
- It's all right. We'll look in the back.
Venkman!
Hey, Venkman!
Please leave. You cannot...
Get out of my restaurant!
It was absolutely incredible!
The greatest tangible evidence of psychic energy in 100 years.
- You're disturbing our guests!
- This is an emergency. One second.
Boys, you're scaring the straights, okay?
Is there any way we can do this tomorrow?
No, this won't wait until tomorrow,
Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.
- Yeah. It's all over the city, Pete.
- Under it, actually.
- Rivers of this stuff.
- It's all flowing right to the museum.
Yeah, the museum!
Look what he got all over me!
What is this stuff?
- Sorry.
- Oh, God. You mean my museum?
I was gonna tell you between the dessert and the cheese course.
- There they are!
- You can never go back there.
- You're gonna have to find a new job.
- Psychomagnotheric plasma.
- It affects behavior. We were fighting.
- We were in a fight.
He had him by the throat...
I'm glad they're here.
We gotta see the mayor.

- Oh, Ghostbusters!
- How you doing?
Hey, guys, come right this way.
You guys got another one of those proton packs? My kid brother really wants one.
- The proton pack is not a toy.
- I guess he's right.
Ah.
Dana, we were just babysitting, honest.
And we watched some TV and had something to eat and then and one thing led to another.
- I know what you were doing.
- I didn't know anything would happen.
Hi, Dana. How was your date?
- It wasn't a date, it was just dinner.
- Well, where's Peter?
He was arrested.
Typical.
- Did he call?
- No, no. Nobody called.
Well, how's Oscar? Is he all right?
Oh, he's fine. Such a good baby.
He was a little fussy at first, then we just gave him some French bread pizza, passed right out.
Good. Good. Well, I'll just give him a look-see.
- So you think we should go?
- Gee, I don't know.
I don't think we should leave her alone.
You're right. Let's stay.
- Lenny! Big man!
- Ghostbusters.
Mr. Mayor.
What is this? A slumber party?
That's what we're here to talk about.
Look, I don't wanna hear anything about it.
You've got two minutes.
Make it good.
Well, first of all, Mr. Mayor, it's a great pleasure to see you again.
We'd like to say that almost 50 percent of us voted for you in the last election.
- I appreciate that.
- I'm just sorry we always meet under these circumstances.
Mr. Mayor, we're here tonight because a psychomagnotheric slime flow of immense proportions is building up beneath the city.
- Psycho-what?
- Psychomagnotheric.
- Big word.
- Negative human emotions are materializing in the form of a viscous, psychoreactive plasm with explosive supernormal potential.
Does anybody speak English here?
Yeah, Your Honor, what we're trying to tell you is, like, all the bad feelings, I mean, all the hate, the anger and violence of this city is turning into this sludge.
I didn't believe it at first either, but we just went for a swim in it, and we ended up almost killing each other.
This is insane! I mean, do we really have to listen to this?
Can't you stop your lips from flapping for two little minutes?
Lenny, have you been out on the street lately?
Do you know how weird it is out there?
We've taken our own head count.
There seem to be 3 million completely miserable assholes
- living in the Tri-State area.
- Oh, please.
I beg your pardon.
3 million and one.
What budgie-brain here doesn't realize is that if we don't do something fast, this whole place is gonna blow like a frog on a hot plate.
- Yeah, right.
- What am I supposed to do?
Go on television and tell 10 million people they have to be nice to each other?
Being miserable and treating other people like dirt is every New Yorker's
God-given right.
Your two minutes are up.
Good night, gentlemen.
- Wait.
- You're making a mistake, Mr. Mayor.
A very newsworthy mistake. The
Times is gonna be interested in this,
- and you know The Post...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Now, now...
"Mayor Drowns in River of Slime."
- "Times Square Slime."
- "Slime Square."
Fine. Now, before you go running off to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime business to some of our people downtown?
It's gotta be done right away.
Well, it's gonna come back!
This city's in danger!
The whole state! The world!
- All we wanna do is help!
- I'm warning you.
The mayor wants them kept under strict observation for the next few days.
We think they're seriously disturbed and potentially dangerous.
- Well, we'll do whatever's necessary.
- Thank you, doctor.
I await the word of Vigo.
I, Vigo,
- the scourge of Carpathia,
- No, you told me this, the scourge.
- the sorrow of Moldavia,
- Sorrows, I've heard all of this, yes.
- command you.
- Command me, lord.
The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.
Good.
Bring me the child, that I might live again.
Yes!
Lord Vigo...
I was wondering.
This woman, Dana, is fine and strong.
Now... if I was to bring the baby, could I have that woman?
So be it.
On this day of darkness, she will be ours.
Wife to you and mother to me.
Yes!
Thank you, lord! Thank you.
- I mean, is she the killer or what?
- No, that's Rita Hayworth.
She was married to Citizen Kane while they were doing this thing.
Right after they finished, she dumped him for some polo player. Thanks.
I don't know why beautiful women love horses so much. Do you love horses?
- No.
- You really don't have to stay.
I'm sure Peter will be back soon.
Oh, we don't mind.
Can you see okay?
Yep.
Oscar?
Oh, God!
Oscar!
Louis!
- What?
- It's Oscar!
- Oscar.
- Call 911 right now!
Oscar.
Oh, no.
Oh, God. No!
No!
- It was a ghost!
- No.
- No, that was Janosz.
- What?
- He took him.
- What? What's happening?
- What should we do?
- Where's the baby?
The museum!
- Where are you going?
- I've gotta get my baby!
We gotta find the guys.
As I explained before, we think the spirit of a
17th-century Moldavian tyrant is alive and well in a painting at the Manhattan Museum of Art.
And are there any other paintings in the museum with bad spirits in them?
You're wasting valuable time.
He's drawing strength from a psychomagnotheric slime flow that's been collecting under the city.
- Yes, tell me about the slime.
- It's very potent stuff.
We made a toaster dance with it.
And a bathtub tried to eat his friend's baby.
A bathtub?
Don't look at me. I think these people are completely nuts.
Oscar.
Sweetheart.
I thought I'd lost you, that
I'd never see you again.
Oh, baby.
Hello, Dana. I thought that you might come.
You stay away from us, Janosz. I mean it.
Oh, don't worry. He will not be harmed.
He has been chosen to be the vessel of the spirit of Vigo.
And you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.
Doesn't that sound nice?
No, it sounds ludicrous.
You stay away from him. I mean it.
Well, I don't think we have choice here, yes? Take a look.
It's not Gainsborough's
Blue Boy there, huh?
He is Vigo.
I don't care who he is.
You're not gonna take my baby.
Oscar!

A skeleton? Which way was it heading?
Wait a sec. What was chasing you in the park?
The park bench was chasing you?
- I see.
- What?
Wait a second.
Lieutenant, I think you better talk to this guy.
I'm busy here.
It's some dock supervisor down at Pier 34.
What's the problem?
He says the Titanic just arrived.
Well, better late than never.
We're swamped. We've had more than
3000 calls since midnight last night.
We've got every man in uniform on the streets and I'm still shorthanded.
We've got meter maids chasing ghosts all over midtown.
There's this shell thing over the Manhattan
Museum of Art. We can't make a dent.
- Have you tried dynamite?
- We've tried everything.
What the hell's going on?
It's pandemonium out there.
- I know. We're working on it.
- Great. While you're working on it,
I'm going down in history as the mayor who let New York get sucked down into the 10th level of hell.
All right. We've got no choice.
Call the Ghostbusters.
Wait!
Now, I'm sure there's another way.
Jack, I spent an hour last night in my bedroom talking to Fiorello La Guardia, and he's been dead for 40 years.
Now, where are the Ghostbusters?
They're not available.
What do you mean, they're not available?
Well, I had them committed to the psychiatric ward at Parkview Hospital.
- You what?
- They threatened to go to the press.
I was protecting your interests.
Yeah? Well, you can stop protecting my interests.
You have exactly three minutes to clear out. You're fired!
But the election...
- Remove this man.
- You're making a mistake.
- And get me the Ghostbusters!
- Mr. Mayor, come take a look at this.
Wow.
What is it?
Have you ever seen anything like that?
Somebody get me the Ghostbusters.
Then he put the baby in a carriage and then levitated away.
Where did Dana go?
She was going to the museum to get the baby back.
Then there was an eclipse. The whole town went dark and everybody's nuts.
It all fits. Vigo wants in on the 21st century.
He needs a human body to inhabit. Little Oscar must be it.
And I bet we're the only ones who can help.
You bet we are.

Well, mainly Vigo's.
Dana.
You and I have this terrific opportunity to make the best of this relationship.
We don't have a relationship.
I know! Marry me, Dana.
Together we will raise
Vigo as our son.
And let me tell you something here.
There are many perks in being the mother of a living god.
I'm sure we could get a magnificent apartment, a car, free parking.
Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance.
Yet I think that perhaps you and I could learn... to love each other?
Yes.
I could learn.
Pull them.
Full neutronas.
Let's cook!
Save them.
That slime wall is pulsing with evil.
It would take a tremendous amount of positive energy to crack that shell and I seriously doubt that there's enough goodwill left in this town to do it.
I just can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back.
I mean, sure, it's dirty, it's crowded, it's polluted, it's noisy, and there's people all around who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.
But come on!
There gotta be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.
We just have to figure out a way to mobilize it.
He's right. We need something that everyone in this town can get behind. We need...
A symbol.
Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us.
Something good.
Something decent.
Something pure.
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Wonder what?
Whether she's naked under that toga.
She's French. You know that.
Got it.
Ready with the speakers,
Ray. Slime blowers ready.
Okay. Internal audio set.
Internal electric set.
Slime blower primed and set.
Ooh, good slime. Good slime. Winston, is our slime in a good mood tonight?
I hope so. She's a lot bigger than a toaster.
All yours, Venkman. Let's go.
Thank you. Testing, one, two, testing.
Hey, how many of you people here tonight are a national monument?
Would you raise your hand, please. Oh, hello, miss.
- Let's frost it.
- It's slime time.
Beautiful.
Pilot controls are ready.
All right. It's getting late. It's almost midnight. Let's go, Venkman.

- Can't you go any faster?
I'm afraid the vibrations will shake her to pieces.
- We should have padded her feet.
- They don't make Nikes in her size.
Don't worry. She's tough.
She's a harbor chick!
Sorry! My fault!
Happy New Year.
Stay fit. Keep sharp.
Make good decisions.
Oh, good. Oh, good. Oh, good.
Okay.
Oh, it's you.
Okay, but I didn't know you had your license.
Four minutes to go, and then party times.
It's happening.
It's really happening.
No. No!
Go away from here!
- I love you when you roughhouse!
- Hit it, Mama!
- Drop the hammer on her!
- Go! Do it now!
- Oscar, look.
- Go away!
- Don't know who that is?
- Happy New Year.
He's Vigo! You are like the buzzing of flies to him!
Oh, Johnny, did you back the wrong horse. Will you hose him, please?
Hose him.
- One down.
- On the ground.
- Boy, am I glad to see you.
- Oh, Oscar. Oscar.
Is he dead?
Uh-uh. This slime is positively charged.
He'll wake up feeling like a million bucks.
Whoa, this gentleman is a little bit ripe.
That's all right, my friend.
I think I had an accident too.
Get him away!
Get a knife or something!
We gotta cut her out of this!
Okay.
All right. Now, listen. You gotta stay right here.
Don't move. Uncle Pete's gotta go help your mom for a second.
You stay here and don't say anything, okay?
Uh-oh.
Hold it right there, deadhead!
You want a baby? Go ahead and knock up some willing hellhound.
Otherwise, I'm giving you three to get back in that painting where you belong.
One!
Two.
Three!
You got him! You got him!
That was really stupid.
Ray, can you move?
No. Are you okay?
No.
Venkman, how are you?
I'm fine.
No.
No! Oscar.
Please, do something!
Not so fast, Vigo!
Hey, Vigo!
Yeah, you. The bimbo with the baby.
Didn't anybody tell you the big-shoulder look is out?
You know, I have met some dumb blonds in my life, but you take the taco, pal.
Only a Carpathian would come back to life now and choose New York.
Tasty pick, bonehead!
If you had brain one in that huge melon on top of your neck, you would be living the sweet life out in Southern California's beautiful San Fernando Valley.
Oh, darn it.
Now we become one.
- Where's that singing coming from?
- People outside.
Excuse me. Ghostbusters.
Wow.
I'm here with you, guys.
He's weakening! The singing is neutralizing the slime!
I can move!
Oscar!
Oh, sweetie.
It's okay.
He's back in the painting!
All right, go find a shady spot.
Vigie, Vigie, Vigie. You have been a bad monkey.
Ray, we'd like to shoot the monster.
Could you move, please?
- Ray.
- Ray.
No!
I, Ray and Vigo, shall rule the Earth!
- Be gone, you pitiful half-men!
- Now!
- I did it! I did it!
- That was great!
- I'm a Ghostbuster!
- I loved it!
- You all right?
- Come on, get up. Let's get this off.
Here.
Here we go.
- How do you feel?
- Groovy.
- You all right?
- Yes. Thank you, Peter.
Spread out, shorty.
I love you guys.
- I love all you guys.
- Great, Ray.
- And I love Venkman.
- Uh-huh. Let's go.
- We gotta live with this?
- Real friendship.
Yeah.
Sir, are you all right?
Why am I drippings with goo?
You had a violent, prolonged, transformative psychic episode.
Sorry we had to hose you there, but you were kind of out of control.
Hey, man, let me tell you something.
I love you.
- Yes?
- Yeah.
Well, I love you too.
Wow.
Hey, fellas.
You wanna take a look at this?
Wow.
Early Renaissance, I think.
Raphael or Piero della Francesca.
No, I believe it's one of the Fettuccines.

That's a big fella! Whoa!
- Looks great.
- Thank you.
Happy vacation, honey.
Manchurian tung oil!
Where did you get this?
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
There's enough here to do the whole table and the bureau.
I wonder what this could be.
Oh, honey, you got it. Thank you.
Enough to do the entire guest room.
I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
- I'm gonna get started now.
- Where are you going?
- I'll get it.
- Be my guest.
- Maybe you should get it.
- I'll go.
Oh, no!
Jane.
It's your turn, honey.
- Good luck, honey.
- Thanks.
Hi, Barbara. I'm glad I caught you.
Heard you were on vacation.
That's right. Complete vacation.
Today I'm $260,000!
- It's 6:45 in the morning.
- This offer is real.
From a man in New York City who only saw a photograph.
Jane, don't send people photos of our house.
He wants to bring the wife and family here for some peace and quiet.
That's what we're looking for.
This house is too big for you.
It ought to be for a couple with kids.
I didn't mean anything.
But this house is too big.
- I'll see you in a few weeks. Okay?
- Think about it.
I was telling Barbara about this offer on the house...
No, Jane.
Come with me to the store.
- What for?
- I need a new brush for the tung oil.
- And I want to get a part for the model.
- Just run in, okay?
Two weeks at home. The perfect vacation.
Jane says we should sell the house to someone with a family.
I don't think it's any of Jane's business.
Besides, we could try again on this vacation.
Really? What are you saying?
- How are you doing, Ernie?
- Hi, how are you?
Good morning, Adam.
- Need a haircut before your vacation?
- No, thanks, Bill.
- How's the model coming?
- Great.
You know, Bozman built that foundation in 1835. His grandson...
He's got hair down to his goddamn shoulders.
He says to me, "Just trim it a little."
- I took the scissors to him so fast...
- See you later.
- This will be great.
- Wouldn't you rather go to Jamaica?
- No way. There's no place like home.
- Look out for that...
Perfect start to our vacation.
You'll feel better when you're dry.
That fire wasn't burning when we left.
- How's your arm?
- I don't know. It feels frozen.
I'll make some coffee and you get wood for the fire.
Maybe we should take things extra slow.
Do you remember how we got back up here?
I'm going back to that bridge and retrace our steps.
- You saved my...
- Two hours!
- You won't believe... What?
- That's how long you were gone.
- What is going on?
- I have to show you something.
Look.
There's that.
And there's that.
- "Handbook for the Recently Diseased."
- Deceased.
Deceased.
I don't know where it came from.
Look at the publisher.
"Handbook for the Recently Deceased Press."
You know what?
I don't think we survived the crash.
I hate this.
Can you give me the basics?
This book isn't arranged that way.
What do you want to know?
Why did you disappear when you stepped off the porch?
Are we halfway to heaven or halfway to hell?
How long will this last?
I don't see anything about heaven or hell.
This book reads like stereo instructions.
Listen.
"Geographical and Temporal Perimeters.
"Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation."
This is going to take some time.
Damn sandworms. Thirteen percent, huh?
I better find a job.
Let's see. Business section.
What do we got here? The Maitlands.
Cute couple. Look nice and stupid, too.
I wish I had a better view of the cemetery from here.
I can't tell which is the best placement for us.
Cabin fever?
I can't clean anything properly.
The vacuum's in the garage and we can't leave the house.
Why don't they tell us something?
Where are the other dead people?
Why is it just you and me?
Maybe this is heaven.
In heaven there wouldn't be dust on everything.
It's Jane.
- What's she doing here?
- I don't know.
Jane, up here. Jane!
She can't see you, right?
In the book, rule number two:
"The living usually won't see the dead."
- Won't or can't?
- It just says "won't."
God, this book is so stupid!
I can't understand anything in it.
Barb, honey...
...we're dead.
I don't think we have much to worry about anymore.
This is great!
Just what the doctor ordered.
Sorry, ma'am.
Delia Deetz, welcome home.
Charles!
It's okay, there's no damage. See?
Good, sturdy, country craftsmanship.
Look at that kitchen. You'll finally be able to cook a decent meal.
Come and have a look.
A little gasoline. Blowtorch. No problem.
Excuse me. Here we go.
We'll have to rip out all the plumbing.
Other than that, it's perfect. Just perfect.
- What do you think, honey?
- Delia hates it.
I could live here.
Careful! That's my sculpture.
I don't mean "my" as in "I bought it."
I mean I made it.
Put it on the table.
Ten minutes. I'm already perfectly at ease.
It's perfect.
Help!
It's Otho.
Otho, why don't you come in the front door?
It's bad luck.
You left the city for me. I am so happy.
Of course you are.
Let's get one thing straight.
We're here to enjoy the country setting, not to trash the place!
Charles, you're lucky the yuppies are buying condos...
...so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place.
I'm here to relax and clip coupons, and, damn it, I mean to do it.
Then go do it quietly, dear, and let Otho and me think.
Is the rest of the house as bad as this?
Is this a punishment?
What are we going to do?
We're not completely helpless.
I've been reading that book and there's a word for people in our situation.
Ghosts!
Let's get this show on the road.
We're dealing with negative entertainment potential.
There's absolutely no organic flow through.
I noticed that, too.
It's like a giant ant farm.
- What?
- I thought I saw something.
You've read my mind.
- I did?
- So few clients are able to read my mind.
They're not open to the experience.
My God!
We just have to pray the other closets are bigger than this one.
Look!
Ozzie and Harriet.
- What happened to these people?
- They died.
Look, an indoor outhouse.
- Viridian.
- Viridian. Why do I know that name?
Blue-green!
Hydrated chromic oxide.
Remember, I'm schooled in chemistry.
I was a hair analyst.
- What?
- Briefly.
Deliver me from L.L. Bean.
I know what you two are up to and you're not going to get away with it!
This is not working out.
I will not stop living and breathing art just because you need to relax.
I'm here with you. I'll live with you in this hellhole.
But I must express myself. If I can't gut this house and make it my own...
...I will go insane and I will take you with me!
Yeah. Well, maybe the house could use a little remodeling.
But why don't you just leave this room alone, okay?
Okay.
I'll get her.
So?
Once you cover the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, this place might be livable.
- What's on the third floor?
- Attic space.
I forgot to lock the attic door.
- Did you feel something?
- When?
- You don't have a key?
- Maybe Charles does.
I have a feeling there's something very interesting behind this door.
Yeah, the ghosts of the people who died in this house, and they want us out!
Let's do them a favor.
My God, that was close!
I cannot watch this.
What's the good of being a ghost if you can't frighten people away?
- Honey?
- No, I'm not putting up with this!
- You don't know what's out there.
- I don't care.
Barbara!
Adam!
Adam, help. I'm getting all yellow!
We're trapped in this house with those people.
I can't believe we're eating Cantonese.
Is there no Szechwan up here?
I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG in this food.
This is our first meal in this house, so let's try to make it a pleasant one.
Don't bait your mother.
When we get settled, we'll build you a darkroom in the basement.
My whole life is a darkroom.
One big dark room.
You were miserable in New York City, and you'll be miserable in the sticks.
At least someone's life hasn't been upheaved.
I'm happy here. Those people in New York don't know what they're missing.
We could become The Summer Art Center of New York.
I could start sculpting again.
I'm only truly happy when I'm sculpting.
That's a very good idea.
That'll be very time-consuming.
First the house.
Otho and I have great plans.
We should keep it the way it is.
Good idea.
The furniture truck is coming.
We must decide what goes and what stays.
Everything goes, along with whatever's in the attic.
Careful.
Tell me what you do and I'll tell you why my husband will fire you.
- Isn't there an index?
- No, nothing.
What's this?
Do you know where that's going?
Did anyone tell you where...
Why are there only three sculptures?
There were four sculptures.
Where's the fourth sculpture?
What are you doing?
"Betelgeuse, the bio-exorcist.
Troubled by the living?
"Is death a problem and not the solution?
Unhappy with eternity?
"Having difficulty adjusting?
Call Betelgeuse."
There's no number or instructions?
Nothing. The "bio-exorcist." I don't get it.
Straight back.
Why don't you take a break for half an hour?
Put that down!
What the hell are you doing?
- Listen to me!
- Jesus!
Why are you doing this to me?
This is my art and it is dangerous.
Do you think I want to die like this?
Hi. How are you?
That little girl saw us.
- Nobody can see us.
- But she did.
- What happened to the previous owners?
- They drowned.
Yes, they were family. I was devastated.
- Here, take that.
- Is this the key to the attic?
That's a skeleton key that will open any door. Give that to your father.
You might mention I single-handedly decorated that house.
If he needs any advice in that arena have him come see me.
Don't worry. I locked the door.
Having trouble with the living?
Tired of having your home violated?
Want to get rid of them pesky living critters?
Well, come on down and see me, the afterlife's leading bio-exorcist.
Yes, sirree! I want to tell you,
I'll do anything!
I'll scare 'em real bad.
I'll do anything to get your business.
Hell! I'll possess myself if I gotta!
Yo! I got demons runnin' all through me.
Come on down and see it.
If you act now, you get a free demon possession with every exorcism.
You can't beat that, can you?
Bring the little partners. We've got plenty of snakes for them to play with.
Say it once, say it twice, third time's a charm. And remember...
"I'll eat anything you want me to eat.
Swallow anything you want me to swallow.
"So, come on down, I'll chew on the dog."
We need some help. I read something in this book about emergencies.
Here it is.
"In case of emergency, draw a door."
"Draw a door"? I don't know why we keep looking in that stupid book.
Maybe we should try that Beetle guy.
You didn't actually think that would work, did you?
"Knock three times."
Birdies!
Get it!
Dad?
- Can't you see I'm relaxing?
- I want to tell you what I saw.
What is the point of my coming here if you people won't let me relax?
Pumpkin, sweetheart...
...go help your mother.
Maybe you can relax in a haunted house, but I can't.
Hmm, nice building.
Bad roof. Good parking.
- Adam?
- This way, honey.
You don't have an appointment.
- We didn't know how to make one.
- Appointment for what?
- What do you want?
- Help?
Already? Just bit the big one two months ago and you want help.
What does that have to do with anything?
You'll use up all your help vouchers: D-90s.
You spend 125 years on earth in that house...
...during which you get only three class-one
D-90 intercessions with Juno.
You probably haven't read through the manual completely yet.
You'll have to wait if you don't have an appointment.
- An appointment with whom?
- For Juno, your caseworker.
Number 54,000,601. Ferndock!
- Want a cigarette?
- No, thank you.
I'm trying to cut down myself.
Adam, is this what happens when you die?
This is what happens when you die.
That is what happens when he dies.
And that is what happens when they die.
It's all very personal.
I'll tell you something.
If I knew then what I know now,
I wouldn't have had my little accident.
Maitland. Party of two.
Take the handbook and go to the sixth door.
Oh, we forgot our handbook.
Come on.
All new arrivals, report to waiting room number eight.
Flight 409 is arriving at gate three.
How do I look?
There are no mirrors on this side.
- You look fine.
- Fine.
Thanks. I've been feeling a little flat.
Will the Peterson party report to door number nine.
Peterson party, please report to door number nine.
All new arrivals, report to waiting room number eight.
125 years. I can't believe this.
I can't believe they didn't tell us.
Oh, Adam, what is this?
That's the Lost Souls' Room.
A room for ghosts that have been exorcised.
Poor devils.
That's death for the dead.
It's all in the handbook.
Keep moving.
Five.
This is the sixth door.
Boy, this place just gets weirder and weirder.
We're home!
Look at this place! Everything's different.
All our furniture's gone.
How long do you suppose we were waiting there?
Three months.
I'd almost given up on you.
I was about to leave.
I do have other clients.
- Are you Juno, our caseworker?
- Yes.
I evaluate individual cases and determine...
...if help is needed, deserved and available.
Are you available?
No.
- What's wrong?
- We're very unhappy.
What did you expect? You're dead!
We want to get rid of the people here.
We worked hard on this house.
We probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were...
- More like you used to be.
- Yes.
But these people!
Things seem quiet here.
You should thank God you didn't die in Italy.
The Deetzes.
- Have you been studying the manual?
- We tried.
The intermediate interface chapter on haunting says it all.
Get them out yourselves! It's your house.
Haunted houses aren't easy to come by.
- We don't quite get it.
- I heard.
Tore your faces off.
It's useless to pull off your heads in front of people who can't see you.
- We should start simply?
- Start simply.
Do what you know.
Use your talents. Practice.
You should have been studying those lessons since day one.
I've got to go.
What about that guy in the flyer, Betel...
Don't even say his name.
You don't want his help.
We might.
No, you don't.
He does not work well with others.
What do you mean?
I didn't want to bring it up.
But rather than have you make another mistake, I'll tell you.
He was my assistant.
But he was a troublemaker.
He went out on his own...
...as a freelance bio-exorcist.
Claimed he could get rid of the living.
Got into more trouble.
I believe he's been sleazing around your cemetery lately.
The only way he can be brought back...
...is by calling his name three times.
But I strongly suggest...
...that you remove the Deetzes yourselves.
How do we contact you...
...if we need you again?
Oh, Adam, that guy's in our cemetery.
She's right. We just keep this simple.
We can do this.
Hey, you, come here!
Hungry?
Come on. Hey, come here.
I got something good for you.
Come on over.
We'll have a little bite, something to nosh.
- Come here!
- Help me!
Maxie, haven't I always made you money?
That's the only real question.
Nobody made me money like you.
You were a demon until your nerves went.
It's just that...
...Winter River, Connecticut is, if you'll forgive me, nowhere.
Why would I want to invest that kind of money in an old building...
...way the hell up there!
- It's not a building. That's the beauty.
The people don't know the value of their property. I can buy the whole town.
Then we own a whole town in the middle of nowhere.
Come and see.
And bring Sarah.
All right, Charles.
It's just that I am kind of busy here.
Just a minute.
Listen. Enough of this talk about visiting, okay? I gotta go.
You take it easy up there, big fellow.
- Good-bye.
- Max, wait, wait.
Putz.
Lydia, is Connecticut so boring?
I had Maxie Dean on the phone.
Dad's found a way of making money while I relax, so would you scram?
Your mother will kill you when she sees you cut holes in her $300 sheets.
This is so corny. Is this what we've been reduced to? Sheets?
Think of them as death shrouds.
And the moaning is important.
Really moan!
God, how can he stand that woman?
Cut it out! I'm a child, for God's sakes.
- I feel so stupid.
- It's not stupid. We're ghosts!
Do you want to spend the next 125 years having breakfast with this woman?
Moan louder.
Oh, God!
Sick. Sexual perversion.
Do that weird sexual stuff in your own bedroom.
Ah, no feet.
Are you the guys hiding in the attic?
We're ghosts!
- What do you look like under there?
- Aren't you scared?
I'm not scared of sheets.
Are you gross under there?
Are you Night of the Living Dead under there?
Like all bloody veins and pus?
- "Night of the," what?
- "Living Dead." It's a movie.
If I had seen a ghost at your age,
I would have been scared out of my wits.
You're not gross.
Why are you wearing sheets?
We're practicing.
- You can see us without the sheets?
- Of course I can see you.
How can you see us and nobody else can?
I read through that
Handbook for the Recently Deceased.
It says, "Live people ignore the strange and unusual."
I myself am strange and unusual.
You look normal.
- You read our book?
- Yes.
- You could follow it?
- Yes. Why were you in Delia's bedroom?
- Trying to scare your mother.
- Stepmother.
You can't scare her.
She's sleeping with Prince Valium.
You did this?
You carved these houses and things?
And this used to be your house.
Why do you want to scare everybody?
We wanted to frighten you so you would move out.
You don't know the Deetzes.
My father bought this place.
He never walks away from equity.
- Why don't you leave?
- We haven't left since the funeral.
Funeral!
God! You guys really are dead.
This is amazing.
- I better go.
- Wait.
- Don't tell your parents we're here.
- Unless it will frighten them away.
Tell them we are horrible...
...desperate, ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing...
...to get our house back.
What if this is a dream? Can you do any tricks to prove I'm not dreaming?
If you are real ghosts, you better get another routine because those sheets...
...they don't work.
Ghosts.
You're telling me we have ghosts in this house.
Those pictures are of ghosts.
Ghosts!
Lydia, I am giving a dinner party tonight for seven people.
My agent, Bernard, is bringing a woman who writes for Art in America.
In fact, no one dining here has not been in Vanity Fair except you.
I told them you were too mean to be afraid.
Don't you dare speak to others about me!
Being embarrassed in front of the few people who will set foot in here scares me.
So let's play family just for tonight.
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
She's got photos.
Adam, you have a photo of Bigfoot.
My photo of Bigfoot is a different story.
We've got to get some help. We've got to contact Betelmeyer or something.
Look.
It's him. Betelgeuse.
Betelgeuse.
Go ahead, Barbara, say it.
Betelgeuse!
What happened?
I think we're in the model.
Look at that.
Where is he? What do we do?
Looks like we dig.
It's about time!
- I say we open it.
- Maybe we should knock first.
Adam. Babs.
You can pick 'em! Is this a solid relationship? Do I have a shot?
- Excuse me.
- Sure. Am I overstepping my bounds?
It's beautiful! You picked me.
You didn't have to, but you picked me.
It makes me want to kiss you guys!
Come on, give me one.
I beg your pardon!
Let's get down to business.
I've got a card here somewhere.
Here. Who do I have to kill?
- Hold that for me.
- Whoa!
- There you go.
- You don't have to kill anybody!
Possession! Learn to throw your voice.
Fool your friends. Fun at parties.
No. We just want to get some people out of our house.
I understand. In order to do that,
I'll have to get to know you.
We've got to get closer.
Move in with you for a while.
Get to be real pals.
You know what I'm saying?
Save that guy for later.
My wife and I have some questions.
Sure, go ahead. Shoot.
What are your qualifications?
Well, I attended Juilliard. I'm a graduate of Harvard Business School.
I travel extensively.
I lived through the Black Plague.
I've seen The Exorcist about 167 times...
...and it keeps getting funnier every time I see it!
Not to mention the fact that you're talking to a dead guy!
Now what do you think?
You think I'm qualified?
Can you be scary?
Oh! I know what you're asking me.
Can I be scary?
What do you think of this?
You like it?
- Will you excuse us, please?
- Sure. Talk amongst yourselves.
- Let's go.
- I know, but he can be useful later.
- We can work something ourselves.
- Oh, yeah!
- Excuse me!
- What?
We are leaving now.
Don't go yet.
Come on, we're simpatico.
Look at us. We shop at the same store.
Hey, hermano.
Yeah, there you go.
We're like peas in a pod.
You want someone out of the house.
I want to get someone out of your house.
Look! You've been to Saturn.
I've been to Saturn!
Whoa. Sandworms.
You hate 'em, right? I hate 'em myself.
Kids, what do I have to do to strike a deal with you two?
- Don't you hate it when that happens?
- Let's go, Barbara!
Come up for a while.
We'll talk inside. Come on.
- I'm not staying.
- The place is a mess.
We have to get out of here.
Home! Home! Home!
How did you do that?
Hope you like Italian.
Where'd you go? Hey, where'd you go?
Hey! You've got to work with me here.
I'm just trying to cut a deal.
What do you want me to do?
Where are you?
You bunch of losers!
You're working with a professional here!
Nice fucking model!
We can do this stuff on our own.
Besides, I'm not exposing that little girl to that pervert.
We did call him, and he seemed awfully pissed off.
I don't care. I've changed my mind.
We can scare them off ourselves... tonight.
I have an idea.
What you did with the place is wonderful.
Not me. Them.
So?
You like them.
I hope it wasn't yet another of your dreary suicide attempts.
You know what they say about people who commit suicide?
In the afterlife, they become civil servants.
Otho, I didn't realize you were into the supernatural.
Of course! You remember.
After my stint with the Living Theater...
...I was one of New York's leading paranormal researchers...
...until the bottom dropped out in '72.
Paranormal? Is that what they're calling your kind these days?
Don't mind her. She's still upset that somebody dropped a house on her sister.
Well, this looks really good.
I saw some ghosts.
- It's a private joke Lydia and I share.
- It's not a joke.
Yes, it is. Just today she tried to convince me this house is haunted.
Kids! You know, I love them!
- Ghosts?
- In designer sheets, no less.
I'd like to propose a toast to our intrepid friends...
...who braved the expressway and two dozen tollbooths to be with us.
May your buildings go condo.
Lydia, favor us about your ghosts.
No! I am sick of that subject.
Delia, lighten up.
I would rather talk about...
That's cute, Delia.
Otho, are you doing this?
We did it!
Let's watch them scatter.
Any minute now they'll come running out of that door screaming.
Any minute now.
It's me, Lydia.
They want you to come downstairs.
Delia says you can wear any sheets you want.
It was like being in an amusement park.
Wham!
- I didn't know I could do the calypso.
- Who has more fun than us?
We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn.
A very sophisticated pair.
They even appear in sheets.
Charles, why didn't you tell us about this before?
We're not sure we want our secret out.
Everyone will want them for parties.
People will pay big money for this.
The Enquirer is offering $50,000 for proof of life after death.
This is it, Charles.
You can get Maxie Dean up here now.
- You think so?
- Sarah loves the supernatural.
She'll have him sprint up here in his helicopter...
...if you can produce ghosts for her.
I should remind you that I'm Delia's agent.
I have lost money on her work for years.
If anything happened here, I shall handle it.
But not until I've seen real proof.
- What about this table?
- What do you call what just happened?
What money?
Don't you believe in my work?
Here's Lydia.
- Well?
- They don't want to come down.
Why not?
I think they were trying to scare you away, and you didn't get scared.
They're dead.
It's a little late to be neurotic.
All right.
This was not a hallucination.
This was real.
We all experienced a super-powerful paranormal experience and it was real.
Delia, you are a flake.
You have always been a flake.
If you insist on frightening people, do it with your sculpture.
Drive carefully!
- I'm dead.
- Where do they hide?
- The attic.
- The attic's locked.
They're ghosts.
They can do what they want.
They do whatever they want.
Take us up there right now.
Fabulous! Otho Fenlock's
"Locked Door Ghosts!"
Probably committed suicide up there.
- I'm enchanted.
- In there?
- They must live like animals.
- It's locked. How did they get in?
Open this door, Dead People, or we'll bust it down...
...and drag you out by the ropes you hanged yourself with!
- They didn't commit suicide.
- It doesn't matter.
I can teach you something here.
Take the upper hand in all situations...
...or people, dead or alive, will walk all over you.
Open up!
Where are they?
These ghosts are nice people.
I think we scared them away, so let's leave them alone, all right?
It's the whole damn town.
I have never been so embarrassed.
Have they gone for good?
Dad, don't.
Mom, let's just go.
No ghosts here.
Come on! If they are in here,
I don't want to scare them away.
We're leaving now.
You can go about your business.
- What are we doing?
- Quick, quick, quick.
Oh, boy! You guys are really spooksters, aren't you?
Now, let's turn on the juice and see what shakes loose.
Otho, get Maxie on the phone.
We've really got something here.
We can turn this place into the world's leading supernatural research center.
An amusement park. I'll do a presentation.
Lydia will bring the ghosts.
I can't bring the ghosts. They're not here.
- Otho, can't you do something?
- If I'm properly motivated.
What type of motivation do you require?
Why don't you leave them alone?
They didn't do anything to you.
We've come for your daughter, Chuck.
Stop! Stop!
- Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse!
- Oh, no!
Why are you doing this?
Leave me alone, all of you!
Great choice! We spend the next century hanging out a window or doing tricks.
Maybe they'll leave now.
That snake was a nasty customer.
- He could've hurt somebody.
- But he didn't.
We've got them where we want them.
You losers! How dare you interrupt a professional while he's working!
I'm not fond of Charles, but you could've killed him.
I'm just doing my job!
I thought we had a deal.
It's okay. You know why?
I don't want to do business with you deadbeats anyway, thank you.
The only one I think I can deal with is Edgar Allan Poe's daughter.
- She understands me.
- Leave her alone!
Go ahead, make my millennium.
I'm feeling a little anxious, if you know what I mean.
It's been about 600 years.
I wonder where an everyday Joe like myself...
...can find a little action.
Yeah. Here I come, baby.
Hey, Adam, nice move!
- Why did you build that?
- I didn't.
Will you guys shut up and leave me alone?
I've got all this paperwork to do.
You two, come in. Sit down.
Get in here, both of you!
The whorehouse was my idea.
I want Betelgeuse out of the picture.
You two have really screwed up.
I heard you allowed yourselves to be photographed.
You let Betelgeuse out and didn't put him back.
And you let Otho take the handbook!
When?
Never trust the living!
We cannot have a routine haunting like yours...
...provide proof that there is existence beyond death.
Coach, where's the men's room?
I'm not your coach. He survived.
Let me get something straight.
- What's our curfew?
- Get out of here!
Go on, get downstairs! Men's room!
Are you kidding? Can't you read signs?
I'll be right back.
Maybe this was a bad idea.
I didn't say anything.
Who are we kidding?
You've never had a bad idea.
Yeah?
This could all work out.
Home.
I'm not sure this is the right environment for Lydia.
- Snakes. Ghosts.
- Shrimp.
You family types.
You've got other things to worry about.
Maxie Dean is coming tonight.
You have to sell these ghosts.
I can only do so much.
What are you going to do?
Viciously rearrange their environment?
I know as much about the supernatural as I do about interior design.
"I am...
"...alone.
"I am...
"...utterly...
"...alone.
"By the time...
"...you read this...
"...I will...
"...be gone...
"...having jumped...
"Having plummeted...
"...off...
"...the Winter River Bridge."
I don't care what it takes.
You get the Deetzes out of there now!
Wait a minute.
What are you going to do?
To scare them.
I want to make sure it's not some silly parlor trick.
I'll go first.
Not bad. Not bad.
Now you.
Go ahead!
You look great.
Go clean house and don't forget the photographs and the handbook.
- Coach?
- What?
I don't think we survived that crash.
How did you guess?
Mr. And Mrs. Maitland?
Hello?
- Where are you?
- Dead.
Dead, dead, deadski.
Of course they're dead. They're ghosts.
No, I mean they're gone. Split.
Out of here. Afterlife kids.
- Deceased.
- Are you a ghost, too?
I'm the ghost with the most, babe.
You look like somebody I can relate to.
Maybe you could help me get out of here.
I gotta tell you, this death thing...
It's creepy.
Here's my problem.
I've got friends on the outside
I said I'd meet.
I have to be there in person.
So could you help me get out of here?
I want to get in.
Why?
You've probably got your reasons, but I can't do anything from here.
If you could get me out, over there, maybe we could talk.
But to do that you've got to say my name three times.
What's your name?
I can't tell you.
Why not?
If I tell you, you'll tell your friends, they'll call me all the time.
I've got to go to shopping centers for openings, sign autographs, that shit.
It makes my life hell, okay? A living hell.
But maybe if you have a pen...
I know! Do you play charades?
- Yeah.
- Good.
Here we go. Ready?
Two words.
Right!
First word, two syllables.
Look.
Turn around.
I don't know what your signal means.
Look behind you!
Hi. How are you?
Beetle.
Got it. Now, two.
Breakfast? Orange? Orange beetle?
Beetle fruit?
Beetle breakfast?
Beetle drink?
Beetle juice?
- That's it!
- Your name's Beetlejuice?
You said it twice.
Just say it once more. Come on.
It was you, wasn't it? The snake.
You kids and your imagination!
Just say it!
No.
I want to talk to Barbara.
You don't need to talk to Barbara!
Just say it!
Adam, I can't go through with it.
I like that little girl.
But it's too late.
We have to go through with this.
No, we don't. Can't we rebel?
I want to be with Lydia.
Come on! Just say it!
No, don't say it!
Say it!
It's okay. It's us. What's going on?
Beetle...
He said if I let him out he would take me to the other side to find you.
No, Lydia, we're dead.
- I want to be dead, too.
- No!
Being dead doesn't make things any easier.
Listen to her on this.
This is something we know a lot about.
And you can visit us anytime you want.
I have a feeling things are going to be better from now on.
What do you mean, better?
We've decided we're going to invite you and your family to stay.
That's right.
- Can't we bring Maxie up here?
- You've got a stake in this, too.
This is a presentation. It requires a sense of occasion, a sense of style.
- It's big. How will we get it out?
- It's sectional.
- Wait, there are plugs.
- Careful!
Okay, go.
- What's going on?
- I don't know. I'll find out.
Be careful.
We've got Ed Cornwell to head the wax museum...
...dedicated to 50 great moments of the paranormal in Thanksgiving Park.
You must remember Ed.
He's the genius who gave us the talking Marcel Marceau statue.
And D-Con is on its knees to sponsor the insect zoo...
...in the old hardware store.
We can't lose!
Lydia, you decided to join us.
I just finished the initial presentation.
Now it's time to have a stretch...
...and to invite our friends to meet your friends.
Are they here yet?
Charles, we're here to see some ghosts.
They're not here... anymore.
Every time she says that, the paint peels...
...and some wild creature tries to kill us.
But we have pictures, Lydia.
Really. They said they'd come back and we could all live here...
...if you agreed not to tease them or make them do stupid tricks.
She has a tendency to overreact.
Don't worry, we're not relying on her.
We have Otho.
- Are they still here?
- Otho, are they still here?
They're still here. They're just hiding out.
They probably feel guilty about what they did to me.
They're sorry they didn't kill you.
I just want to see them.
Otho, can you do it?
- It'll be tricky, but I think I can handle it.
- No!
What am I worried about?
You can't even change a tire.
I'll be needing something personal of theirs.
You'll have to go to the Goodwill.
Excuse me.
The wedding clothes.
The words:
"Hands vermilion
"Start of five
"Bright cotillion
"Raven's dive
"Nightshade's promise
"Spirits strive
"To the living, let now the dead come alive"
Barbara?
"As sudden thunder pierces night
"As magic wonder mad affright
"Rives asunder man's delight
"Our ghost, our corpse
"And we rise to be"
Help!
Stop it!
"As flies the lizard
"Serpent fell
"As goblin vizard at the spell
"The buried, dead and slain rise again"
What's happening to them?
I don't know.
They're dying!
They're already dead.
They can't feel a thing.
- That's not true! Look at them!
- That's enough.
Can we stop this?
It's too late, Charles. I'm sorry.
Where are you? Help them, please.
Sure, I can help them.
But you've got to help me.
- What?
- I'm what you call an illegal alien.
I want out for good.
To do that, I've gotta get married.
These aren't my rules. Come to think of it,
I don't have any rules.
Come on.
Think of it as a marriage of inconvenience.
We both get something.
I get out. You get the most eligible bachelor since Valentino.
- We're even.
- Okay, just help them.
Sure.
Beetlejuice.
It's show time.
Attention, K-Mart shoppers:
I'm back. I feel real good about myself.
You know what I mean? So...
...without further delay...
...welcome to Winter River!
Museum of Natural Greed!
A monument to the bored businessman.
Come a little closer.
Step right up! Test your strength.
Thank you.
Thank you! Whew!
That is why I won't do two shows a night anymore, babe.
I won't do 'em.
Well, what have we got here tonight, kids?
We've got the Maitlands.
I think they've had enough exercise for tonight.
Not so fast, Round Boy.
We're gonna have some laughs.
Mom, Dad:
I just want you two to know you're welcome in our house...
...anytime you want to come over.
In the meantime, the dowry's on me, Dad.
The Maitlands are taken care of.
Everything seems to be back to normal.
Shall we?
Called the caterer. He's got a great band.
We're gonna need witnesses. Would you?
Let's get on with the ceremony.
Do you, Betel...
- Nobody says the "B" word.
- Do you take this woman...
...to be your wedded wife?
I don't know. It's a big decision.
I always said if I ever did it,
I was gonna do it only once.
Sure. Go ahead.
And do you, Lydia, take this man...
No! Betel...
She's a little nervous.
Maybe I should answer for her.
I'm Lydia Deetz and I'm of sound mind.
The man next to me is the one I want.
You asked me.
I'm answering.
Yes, I love that man of mine.
Come on.
Come on.
Betelgeu...
Scram!
Come on!
Hey, guy.
May we continue with the ceremony?
- Then by...
- Betelgeuse.
Strike!
Let's roll!
Then by the authority vested in me...
- The ring, please.
- The ring! Oh, no!
I've got it, honey.
Here it is. Here you go.
She meant nothing to me. Nothing at all!
- I now pronounce you...
- Yeah, come on.
Man and...
- What time is it?
- It's about 3:30.
Give or take a year.
Well?
Did you get the paints?
Yes. And I took pictures of the new town hall for you, too.
How was the science test?
It was gross.
They wanted me to dissect a frog.
I told them "no way." I said it was against my religion. I got a "C."
And the math test?
You're kidding me? We spent the whole week studying for that test.
I got an "A."
So, can I?
I don't know.
Got a "C" on the science test.
Don't tease her.
You never got on "A" in science...
Come on.
Well...
...I suppose.
This reads like stereo instructions.
Sounds like Lydia got an "A" on the math test.
He likes it.
Sorry. Didn't see you sitting there.
Women.
I don't know what her problem is.
Normally, chicks...
Pardon me. Did you do that?
Nice work.
How do you get them so small?
There goes Elvis! Yo, King!
Well, looks like I'm next.
Good thing. I've got to do a photo shoot for G.Q. In an hour and a half.
They've been after me for months.
Some kind of underwear deal.
What are you doing? Stop it.
You're messing up my hair.
Come on! Whoa! Stop it!
This might be a good look for me.

Of course her son * took tha over ** care of everything pyorrhea ** after she had that 
** gingivitis.
Her whole mouth, swell(&?) up,  look like she eat a box of staple. Folks * says she got it from * kiss her old dog.* /////
He swelled his mouth, seemed to have chewing a box of tacks. It was said that both besuquear his old dog.//////
Nice tits!
*Is any home?* Any at home?
Sorry, we're booked ** all of them. **
So how it can says "Vacancy" out there?
Look, we do have a room. Remember the the trucker with the bad skin who check out this morning?
Eu.. I hope you changed the sheets.
- Hi. 
- Is that makeup I see on your face, young lady?
No, mam. I mean yes, mam. *Well,* just a little..
How many times have I told you, you too young to wear makeup.
- No, mother, I don't think it harm..
- Shut up, Leslie!
But grandma, all the other girls at school are wearing make-up.
Yeah, if all the other girls at school jump off the clif would you jump off the clif? What a.. You don't have a sense that you are * born *what* you *..
I hate to interrupt this *little* episode of "The Waltons". But *how* can I *get* a room.
Ok, but it's(its) cach upfront.
I know what you, *pinko*, heavy metal weirdos do to motel rooms.
I read* //They wrote//* about it in "The Star"!
I will, I'll show the lady to her room.
Oh no, you don't!
Hey, don't *want them *get you down? I *use *together* same line about makeup from the nuns at the orphanage.
Of course, I was only eight. Erm.. I'm Elvira.
I'm Robin.
So.. Robin, what is there to do for fun around here, anyway?
This town isn't real big on fun.
But there is one place to **, the bowling alley. * That gets * for a * wild* loud *on late night.
//* It gets pretty wild on league night.**///
Gee, I think I can handle it.
Oh, I'm so sure. They must *they* go realy stupid.
They're gonna kill Spiderman with plutonium? He's got radioactive blood.
Yeah? Let me see that.
- Hey, man, * why did you do that for?* 
- Shut up!
Look at what just walk in!
- "Bloody Mary". 
- No hard liquor served past eight o'clock.
Do you want a "Virgin"?
- Maybe, but, ah.. I'll have a couple of drinks first. 
Hey babe, I got some(thing) to show you.
Sorry, left my magnifying glass at home.
Hey, that's pretty good! Billy, no way to talk to a lady. So, how about a blowjob?
I bet you think *that was* pretty funny, don't you?
- I enjoyed it. 
- Yeah? Will you get enjoy this even more.
- I cut you, man. 
- Travis. 
** baby* 
My name is Elvira. But you can call me.. 'tonight'.
I'm Bob, Bob Redding. Pleased to meet you.
Look at this mess, who, the *heckles*, gonna pay for it?
- It's allright, Patty, I'll take care the damages.
- Seems to me it's all this cheap little tart's fault.
Cheap? *Who you called* cheap? What perfume you *worn*? "Catch of the day"?
Look, honney, I don't know what hole you crawled out, but I suggest you crawl right back in if you know what good for you.
Oh, yeah, you better watch eye ** be careful of not get someone's eye out with that ** things.
We better go.
It looks like you've got some competition, Patty.
Charlie, trash does not compete with class.
.. right down the street, at "Cozy Cot."
Oh. So, what brought you to Falwell?
My car.
No, really I'm came for the reading of my great-aunt Morgana's will.
Morgana Talbot? She is your aunt?
Yes, *it was* a surprise to me too.
I never really know her, but I sure admire her spunk.
She never **came dinner** like* the way* everybody else in this town has.
Well, I don't wanna bore you with local politics.
Go ahead, bore me.
Ok. We've got this town council that lives in mortal fear that somewhere, somehow, someboby in Falwell *has having *a good time.
*Bunch of real preservatives.*
- I run the movie house. 
- Oh, really? I'm in movies too! Have you ever shown, uh, "I married Satan?"
- No. 
- How about the sequel "I Married Satan 2?"
No.
I, ah.. I can only play G-rated movies. 
- Oh well, there's nothing wrong with G-rated movies, as long as there's lots of sex and violence.
I'm, hey, listen Bob, I'm only can be in town for a couple of days and I can think about anyone who I'd rather squeeze in my agenda.
Gee, that be so well.
Oh, Mr. Talbot, your sister was like a mother to me.
She was a mother to me too, dear. Well, now that we've dispensed with the obligatory display of bereavement, you may begin the proceedings, Mr. Bigelow.
It was Mrs. Talbot's wish, to have all of her relatives present to reading of the will.
All of her relatives are present - me, myself, and I.
Apparently Ms. Talbot had a grand-niece, Elvira, who is also one of the beneficiaries.
That is impossible.
- Well. 
- Who is this grand-niece?
Hey guys! Sorry I'm late, but then, so is my aunt.
Hey, what she dies *for?* Nothing serious, I hope.
Say, nice jacket. Who shot the couch?
There is a bathroom around here? I'm telling you the toilet over the "Cozy Cot" looks like somebody's science project.
Who is this woman?
This must be Ms Talbot's grand-niece.
Elvira, this is your grand-aunt's brother, Vincent Talbot.
She was my aunt, and you are her brother, you must be my Uncle Vinnie!
- Get this woman off of me! 
- And you must be Aunty Em and Uncle Remus.
Oh! There is no place like home! There is no place like home!
Hurry up, Bigelow, lets get on with it!
Yeah, really, lets get go on, otherwise somebody else dies.
"This is the certified only last will and testament of the deceased Morgan Talbot."
"To my housekeeper, Mrs. Morrissey, for years of loyalty and devotion, I leave my silver tea service and a cash allotment of $5,000."
Hey, baby what's *you(your) *worrying* about? You ** out * like a ***bandits****
"To Mr. Morrisey, my driver, I leave my automobile and a allotment of $5,000."
Wow, *dude* 10 grand just for a **help** * old aunt ****
Oh, I mean, dear sweet Aunt Morgana, so ***really very*** generous!
What it says about me? What I get? What I get? What I get?
- "To my grand-niece Elvira.."
- Come on, ** about me, Aunt Morgana, big bucks, big bucks!
"I bequeath * my house, my beloved poodle, Algonquin and my precious book of recipes."
That's it? A house, a dog and a book?
Please, if you will allow me to finish.
"And finally, to my dear brother, Vincent, I leave the rest of my estate and holdings, which *stare* is none."
Where's the cash? Where is the furniture? Where is Bob Ubanks?
He was not mention.
I *don't** get it me *, boss. What's so important about a *damn* recipe book?
That damn recipe book content more power than your **fi*vle** little mind can ever imagine.
And it rightfully belongs to me. I must have that book.
Great! *just*  I need a house. And a house in Falwell, *like* I need a padded bra.
I can not live here. I would go crazy! I tell you!
- Crazy!
- May I if you a ride?
- Fuzz off, creep, I'm not in the mood!
Oh, it's you, Uncle Vinnie! 
- Yes!
Uncle Vinnie.. I must apologize for my behavior in the office, it's just that your appearance was a bit of a shock to me.
It's OK. My appearance is kind of a shock to everybody. 
Yes, well, as you * may assumes, * my sister and I, well.. let's just say we had a differences.
Yeah, I guess, you really got shafted.
Look, I *tell you what, *uncle Vinnie, err.. I'll share my inheritance with you. You can have the dog.
No! Thank you! But I would be interested in requiring that recipe book.
You know, *for the* sentimental reasons. I be willing to pay you.
Say, fifty dollars.
Yeah! Sure! I'll do it for fifty buсks.
Vinnie, you got yourself that cookbook.
The lawyer guys take me over the house, so you can pick up it later.
Fine. I'll see you there.
Oh, don't forget to bring a cash.
Drive!
*If wanna those **barrels** should have *** Oh, we're here!
Hey, this place ain't *have* bad! *But* you can get a *abound* for it.
Yes, you could, but your house is over there.
Oh, Mr. Talbot, I just wanted to thank you for that generous donation you make to the Morality Club.
- You're quite welcome. 
- You know, as I always say, morality *are* cheap.
And speaking of cheap, a little birdy told me that that Elvira, woman is a related to you.
* Now, **Not any say**any of my business, but then, of course, everything, yes.
Believe me, I'm so anxious to get rid of her as you are.
Oh, good! You know, because someone like that comes to town, the next thing, you know, the're tiching sex education in the schools,
*and* passing out condoms to *kindergartens*. You remember when those ***..
She won't to be with us very long.
*Yeah, well I know, I need it somewere Chastity Pariah can do, well, I know.*
Careful! Some of the boards to loose.
- What a dump! 
- **/* I 'm not that say, but **/** a house needs a little something.
Yeah! Like a wrecking ball.
- I think Algonquin likes you. 
- **  **, go on, go takes * some in the little stretch.
I can't stand a little dogs. Boy, if my aunt was not dead, I'll kill her.
Sorry, Aunt Morgana, just kidding.
Here is the rest of her inheritance.
Your great aunt's recipe book.
Oh, yeah, some inheritance. Well, at least I'm get'g 50 bucks for it.
Say, how much you think I can get for this place?
Well, if * not the house in *disrepair* it is in the prime location * I've don't you decay* you could get.. 70 thousand.
- 70 grand? 
- Maybe more, if you were fixed up. Would you be interested in selling?
*** Of course I'm interested!
Now, what am I can to do with you?
That's we like it, Algonquin?
Algonquin, what a sissy name! *Let's see* will I call you? I know, Gonk. Hey, you like that?
Yeah, hold your horses.
Hi, Uncle Vinnie, you're here for the book, right? Come on in. Oh, can I make you cup of tea or something?
- I wouldn't wanna produce to any trouble. 
- Good point.
I can't stay very long, anyway.
- Say, you don't wanna buy a house, would you? 
- I'm afraid not.
- I'll sell *at* you really cheap. 
- No, thank you.
Vinnie, they don't make houses like this anymore, I mean. Look at the details.
Look, look at the craftsmanship!
How would you pay for a house like this?
Don't answer, because you not only get the house, if you act right now you also get this beautiful furniture.
Now would you pay? I tell you it's a jewel box.
It's a gem, love hatch for two.
I'd bend over backwards *to* make a deal, I'd bend over forwards. *******
No! Just the book!
OK. If you *wanna* get crab ******
How (it's) weird. I wanna swear (swore) the book was just on the table.

*Handforth,* all students will be subject to immediate expulsion if there are found in the company of that floozy!
Please, I don't think we need to resort the name calling.
I think what Calvin is trying to say is that this Elvira is a person of easy virtue, a purveyor of pulchritude, one moment Sodom and Gomorrah, if you will.
A slimy slithering succubus, a concubine, a street walker, a tramp, a slut, a cheap whore!
She'll be nothing but a bad dream just as soon as she sells that property. An open house is already planned on tomorrow.
But what if she decides not to sell? What if she decides to settle here?
Well, if she is morally unfit, then we have every right to do anything we can to get her out of this town.
Are we agree? 
- Absolutely.
- Maybe we're not being entirely objective about she.. 
- Shut up, Leslie!
And it's unanimous.

Excuse me, is this face taken?
Come on, *, let's Boogie!
Move! Move!
That's an interesting dish. Where did you learn how to make it?
Oh, it's just a old family recipe.
All right, I'll give you a five hundred dollars for the book.
Well, I look like I just fell off a ***? The deal's off, uncle.
You think you're pretty clever, don't you? Well, mark my words, I'll get you and your little dog, too.
Help!
No! No! Oh, you again?
You always wear the same dress? 
- No. Sometimes I like wear some low cut and sexy.
Well, I guess in your business you're paid for advertise.
*Come here,* Bob, let me show how a real woman does it!
Excuse me!
You all saw it! He attacked me in broad daylight and he had his way with me!
Me?! I barely got away with my live. You could have worn out a mechanical bull.
You not gonna get away with it, you sex adult maniac!
I demand that the council remove this pervert.
I never laid a hand on those sheep, so help me.
Calvin was the one who *was ** everybody with apple butter. I was just an innocent on-licker.
Silence!
Don't you see?
You're playing right into her hands.
It's Elvira who is responsible for all this.
Of course, I should have known that she was that little harlot.
*Yeah, ride her * right out of town on a big fat rail.
She might enjoy that too much.
There is a much more satisfactory solution.
We can have her arrested. 
- Arrested, on what charges?
It's so happens that there is a law on that book that dates back to the Salem trials, it's specifically prohibit and I quote:
"Any town's person from practicing the ancient arts of spell casting, demonology, alchemy and conjuration."
The charge, my fellow council members, is witchcraft. 
- Let me out of here! Let me out of here! 
- Stop *screaming* there!
Hey, I've seen the People's Court. I'm entitled to one phone call and a strip search. 
Well, there is a pay phone right across the street. What's the matter? You forget where you put your broom?
Listen, fatso, if I had a broom, I know exactly where I put it.
Oh, this is swell! I can just hear Manny now.
"Hello, Vegas! We get slight crimp on the plans for the show. 'Course star was burnt at the stake."
Elvira, great news. I get to the best lawyer in the county. He'll be here first sing */sign* in the morning.
Bob, in the morning? First sing */sign* in the morning I'll be able to fit in the ashtray. You gotta get me outta here!
But how?
The book! It's my only chance. Quick, went to the house and get it! 
- OK.
- Ou, Bob, wait! 
- What?
I hid it under the floor board in the living room. 
- OK.
- *Bob!* 
- What?
Hurry!
Move!
Now!
What do you whining about? I know *I'm getting* barbecue.
Sorry.
It's mine! The power is mine!
Gonk, *which does not give you a panic attack!*
Wow! I *think I took * too much acid in the '60s.
***** Elvira! Elvira! Elvira!
Elvira! Elvira! Elvira!
- Thank goodness, Padre! 
- I am here to save you, my child.
At last, someone* to talk some sense to *these people.
Lord, save this *raptured* creature's soul even ** creamy white flesh will burn and ***
Well, isn't that convenient!
Thanks for trying, you guys!
Elvira!
Gonk, is that you, boy?
Good work, Gonk!
Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch!
- Do you * smoke? 
- Guess we'll find out soon enough.
Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch!
Burn the witch!
Oh, no! *You will believe* this! **I left the oven on! Be right back.**
Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch!
- Any last words? 
- Just one: Help!
Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch!
Hold it! Hold it now! Quiet. Quiet!
And now, by the power vested in me by the sovereign state of Massachusetts,
I do hereby pronounce sentence on Elvira, the prisoner. Death by fire!
- Hold it, sheriff! What you're doing is wrong. 
- Patty!
It all catch faster, if you light it in several places.
Patty, no!
We have *** this every year.
- Burn in hell, witch! 
- Patty!
Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch!
Bye, kids! It *meant *swell!
Just send my ashes to Las Vegas!
Let me through!
Elvira! 
- Bob!
- Hi, Bob. 
- Patty, you're not a very nice person! 
Gonk?
Remember, you carry the power with you.
The ring!
Are you alright?
Look, the Lunar eclipse!
Remember? Your aunt's letter? When the moon falls under the Earth shadow..
- Yeah, so? 
- Vincent's got the book.
Elvira!
Elvira!
Oh, you tricky little devil!
Vincent, remember us?
We are on your side.
Swine!
Stay back!
Attack him, Gonk!
Don't make me use this!
The amulet could not protect your mother and it won't save you!
Kaldozar ipsole.
*Do you wanna play* rough thing? * Well, take this!
You can not escape me, daughter of Devana!
I shall destroy you as I did her!
You're looking for me?
Did you think you could stop with your toys?
No, but I think it would be worth a shot. Look!
Cosa! Terra! Obtan!
Sure, it easy for you to say.
* That hurts!
Now, baby.
We have a little unfinished business.
Yeah, well, I think we could do business..
Yeah, sure, I can do to you..
Uh.. I'm cool, bro.. no, what it is.. What is that?..***
I'll show you what..
I am a Master of The Dark!
I'll see you in hell *berth!*
And now, Elvira, you'll die!
Remember, you carry the power with you!
So, what did the insurance(t) guy say?
My policy does not cover *ancient*/*accident* demons.
Well at least you still got the ring.
Yeah, but the only thing I *get* to do anymore is look cheap. 
Gosh, Elvira, I'm sorry. *I know you hate your heart some play in Las Vegas.*
I'm just not the kind of girl whose dreams come true.
I do better a nightmares.
- I wish I ** something I can do. 
- Oh, do not worry about me, Bob, I'm like a fake fruit, *** easy.
Hey, Bob, they comes to lynch *me.* Take it easy, take it easy, I'm living.
We don't want you to go. This is our way of saying we were wrong about you and we're sorry.
Elvira, you're the best thing that ever happened to our town.
You touch a part of my son that, that nobody's ever touched before.
How I wish..
As long as you in Falwell, you will always have a free room at the "Cozy Cot."
- Wait, just a minute, Leslie! 
- Shut up, you old bag!
- *Finally, I got it runnuing.* 
- Great! ** At least *now I have* a place to live.
But I still* have no way to *pay for it. 
- Do not worry, we *work out* something.
Elvira, I'm sorry that I set you on fire and everything and..
I hope there no heart fillings.
Do not worry, she is bigger than that.
Yeah, a lot bigger.
Elvira, I've got some an important papers that you gonna have to sign.
But your uncle gone you're the only heir to his estate.
- I am? 
- Las Vegas!
- Elvira, that's fantastic!
Las Vegas!  Las Vegas! Las Vegas!

This is Intercepter One, It's going down,
I repeat, the Bogey is going down,
Detail, attention!
Yes, sir!
You! You!
Present arms!
Present arms!
- Sorry l used the security phone, sir.
- That's all right, Max.
- My golf's not what it was.
- This sounds crazy. l think we have a...
Max, what could be worse than invading Europe?
After you, sir.
- Brief me.
- lt entered our air space last night. lt made a mockery of our intercepters.
According to our pilots, it suffered a malfunction and crashed in the desert.
Was there a crew or any survivors?
The egg-heads found the remains of two creatures and pulled the engine out.
They want time to study it.
- Has the press gotten wind of this?
- We don't think so, sir.
But we can't keep this on ice indefinitely.
Get rid of it.
Right away, sir.
So, what l've attempted to do here is to instill in you a basic scientific curiosity about the world we live in.
Sherman, tell me about your science project.
Mr Roberts, l've studied the accuracy of the Gregorian calender in relation to the vernal equinox.
Good. Ellie, tell me about yours.
Well, Mr Roberts, l'm doing the... l want you to listen! l'm doing the effects of ultaviolet rays on plant fungus.
That's outta sight, Ellie.
Would you call me Bob?
Only the pigs call me Mister.
They're not getting away with it. Harlan!
Why not tell us about your science project?
What?
This is science class.
Your science project?
- l'm working on it.
- You're working on it?
Hey, Mike.
Ciao, babe!
How is that, two weeks before graduation, a man of your mechanical capabilities hasn't finished his science project? l've been working at Charlie's garage. lt cuts into my free time.
- Yeah.
- You know. l don't make the rules around here, but bottom line, golden rule - no project, no diploma, babe.
Oh, yeah. l thought l could, maybe, rebuild a carburettor if that's OK.
Come on, Harlan. You do that in your sleep.
Do something special, something original.
Come on, man.
And don't forget your science final tomorrow.
Hey, man. l don't like to hassle you, Mike.
Have a nice day.
- Nice day?
- Yeah. Come on! l was your age once - in the '60s when all you needed to finish school was a Frisbee.
A gas mask helped!
- See ya later, Bob.
- Protest songs, white rabbits.
TNT didn't hurt anything.
''Take tea and see''.
Free love!
Cosmo says that today is the day, so get rid of 'em.
Hey, Crystal. How you doin'?
Michael, l can't keep this mink wheel.
What? Why not?
We must seek different destinies, Michael.
Our song is over, finis. Comprendez?
No, wait a second.
Talk English, will you, Crystal?
You're more interested in your stupid GTO than me.
Wait. Whose name is on my fender? Yours!
Don't we go out all the time? Don't we?
- To car shows, drag racing, junkyards.
- So what?
- That's not what l want.
- So what do you want, Crystal? Him?
Michael, l want to be swept off my feet, seranaded, worshipped like a goddess.
Come on! Bullshit!
That is exactly what my ''Cosmo'' romantiscope said you'd say, Michael.
Ta-ta for ever, monkey wrench!
Romantiscope?!
Ellie, l know it's short notice but l was wondering if you wanted to go to the prom?
Look, Sherman, can we talk about it later?
Gotcha! Finally! Now l need some information from you, OK?
- Pull the plug will you?
- lt's for the yearbook. l need stats now!
- You got lousy timing.
- l know. lt's a flaw in my character.
Now, what's your sign, Harlan?
Pontiac.
''Bimbo leaves Harlan in limbo!''
Makes a great yearbook headline, don't you think?
Newsflash update.
- l dumped Crystal.
- That is not what l heard.
- No?
- No!
OK. What do you want to know?
- Your major?
- Yeah.
Major? l don't know. Auto shop.
- Favourite video game?
- ''World Series''.
All right, how many times did you see ''Jedi''?
- l never saw ''Jedi''.
- You never saw ''Jedi''?
Have you been under a car for ten years?
- All right, what do you like?
- What do l like? l like cars. l like Springsteen. l like...l like my goat, you know.
- Goat?
- Yeah.
- OK, yeah, but...?
- But what?
What do you do in your spare time?
Cars. Bye.
What goat?! l want you!
Mike! So what's the dish, cousin fish?
What happened? Talk to me.
- What? With who?
- With Crystal.
Everybody know about this but me? ln ''Dynasty'', this guy got a girl back with a Chihuahua fur coat!
Vince! She doesn't want a fur coat.
She doesn't even want me.
- Yeah? What does she want?
- l don't know. She wants to be...romanced.
- Swept off her feet.
- l'd sweep her off her feet with a left!
- A girl pulls that back in Brooklyn. Bam!
- OK, Vince.
Hey. You're cool, right?
You're cool?
Yeah. l'm cool. l don't know, Vince.
- Crystal.
- Why can't women be like cars?
You put gas in a car and you cruise.
Try and treat that girl nice and she leaves me in the dust.
You know, my old man says treat broads like dirt and they love ya.
Yeah? What's your old lady say?
My parents are divorced. That's how come l'm living in the sticks with the old man.
- What did Sawyer want?
- l don't know. Yearbook stats.
- l hit on Sawyer once.
- Yeah? l tried to give her this ltalian macho bod!
- What did she do?
- Poor girl lost out!
Called me a word l had to look up in the dictionary. Psych majors are trouble.
- l'm serious!
- Check this out. l put in new lifters.
- Blow Matuski away!
- Matuski's a fag!
Yeah, man! Let's roll!
Come on, Sawyer! Move that thing away!
Come on! Get it out of there!
- What's going on, Sawyer?
- lf l knew that, Harlan, l'd fix it!
OK! Come on, you're holding everybody up. Get in the car.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Motorhead Mike!
Show-off! l don't believe this.
OK, Sawyer. What's going on?
Distributor caps don't just pop off unless you want 'em to.
OK. lt's confession time. l need you to save me from being voted Senior Class Spinster.
What?
Be a boy scout and give me a date.
Sawyer!
Too much!
OK.
OK, Sawyer. l'll pick you up at eight.
Be outside.
- Outside? Won't you meet my parents?
- Yeah. Outside. No way.
You're better with cars than with people.
Look, if you don't want to do this, it's fine...
No, Harlan. Really. l'll be outside at eight. Fine.
OK.
Oh, yeah, one more thing.
Do you read that mag ''Cosmo''?
That rag? Are you kidding?
Good.
- Harlan?
- What?
The name's Ellie not Sawyer, OK?
Right. Ellie.
Hey, let's move it or we'll move it for ya!
- Let's go, Sherm the worm!
- Move the heap, gonad.
Get it outta the way!
Here you are. A bit more! lt's so good!
Mikey! Mike!
This is my kid here.
- Hi.
- l didn't expect you home so early. l...l got take-out here.
Why don't you grab yourself a table?
Oh, no, no. That's OK.
Oh, Mike, l'd like you meet Delores.
She's the sales representative for...
- Betty-Jo.
- Betty-Jo Cosmetics.
- How do you do, Michael?
- Hi. l'm so pleased to make your acquaintance. l gotta get going. l've got a date. l'll just...l'll just take a beer.
Nice meeting you, Louise.
Come on, Skipper.
Ciao, Michael.
Louise?
- You're really out to impress me, Harlan!
- What?
- Breaking and entering on a first date!
- Come on! l can't believe this. l must have a masochistic tendency l didn't know about.
Doesn't anybody wine and dine a girl any more?
Come on!
Keep it down, will you? Get down!
Oh, come on, Harlan. Wait up! Harlan!
This may be a stupid question, but what are we doing in a junkyard?
- This isn't just any junkyard.
- What's special about it? lt used to be an old military testing ground.
Now they just dump all their old junk here. l thought you'd like it.
- You want to be a reporter, don't you?
- Yeah. Or a psych.
- What's that got to do with anything?
- Look around.
Everything here's got a story behind it.
Yeah. You know, you're right. l never really thought about it.
Harlan!
What are we doing here? l need a project to graduate. l can't do anything scientific.
What l can do is...is restore old machines. l might find something to pass off as my science project.
Michael! Are you OK?
Yeah. Just get that light out of my eyes.
Sorry.
- What is it down there?
- l don't know. A fallout shelter or something.
''You can protect yourself from radioactive fallout.''
- Michael, what is it?
- Nothing. Please keep your voice down.
OK.
Michael, where are you?
Michael, it's really spooky up here.
Please come back.
Yeah. Just a second.
''Property of US Government''.
Michael, l think l heard something.
''To be opened by authorized personnel
''only under controlled conditions''.
- Ellie, toss me that big light.
- OK.
Thanks.
What...?
Michael, please come out so l can see you.
Hey, Ellie?
OK, that's it, Harlan.
This is the end of the line for me.
What are you doing up there?
We've gotta get outta here.
- On that ratty ground?
- There are worse things than rats.
- Yeah? Such as what?
- You kids! Hold it right there!
- Jail. Come on!
- Oh, God!
This is Federal property!
Just great! l'm gonna get arrested and end up in some woman's prison somewhere.
Will you stop talking and run?!
- So, you come here often?
- Come on!
Come on, girl. Let's get 'em.
So what do you do for fun?
Hurry up.
Stop, you two! Freeze!
Hold it!
- Well, a night to remember.
- Look, l...
What was that? l don't get it.
What did you do?
Nothing. lt just died. Doesn't make sense. l just tuned this thing.
- What's going on?
- Don't ask me. You're the car nut.
- What's going on?
- l don't know.
Damn!
Lucky we're close to town.
- Yeah? How's that lucky?
- We can walk.
- Not me.
- What are you talking about?
- l'm stayin' here.
- Staying here? Why?
First, l'd never leave my goat here, all right?
Secondly, if l walked into town the whole world would know l broke down.
- Come on! lt happens to everybody.
- Not to me.
Then why are we standing here?
- Oh, thanks.
- Are you OK? l got a little car problem.
Can l use your radio?
Sure.
- Can l get channel 18?
- Yeah.
- Slower...
- BrookIyn Boy! Do you read me?
Rene...
BrookIyn Boy, read me?
Whoa! Come on.
Wait a minute. Wait. Oh, man!
Mike, is that you?
Yeah, it's me.
Listen, l got an SOS, OK?
Five miles north of town on 73, do you read me?
- Hey, l'm comin'. Chill out.
- Hey, Vinnie!
My partner needs me. We're outta here.
So what am l? Kryptonite?
- Do you want a sip?
- l don't like beer.
Right.
Sawyer and Harlan!
Wait till Crystal finds out about this.
Rene, zip it up!
Hey, you punks! Move that piece of junk to the side of the road.
Sit on this, butt plug!
Punk!
All right! Yeah!
OK, ease up. This is it.
That's good, Vinnie.
Not now. l'm not in the mood no more.
- You'll be begging me later.
- lf you're lucky.
Motorhead Mike broke down?
Wait till we spread that around school. l had a...really neat time tonight.
Yeah. Sure you did!
No, no, really. lt was... lt was a surprise.
Like you, Harlan.
Hey, Ellie?
The name is Michael.
OK?
OK, Michael.
- Good night.
- 'Night.
- Let's go, Vinnie!
- Blasting off! l thought you had dibs on Sawyer, Sherm.
Look, do we have a deal or what?
Messing with Harlan and Tonto's gonna cost ya.
- How much?
- One video cassette.
- Term paper.
- Science project.
You got it!
Let's go.
Ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine, one hundred.
You ain't exactly been the perfect date, Vinnie.
- You ain't exactly been a perfect date.
- Since when?
Since you still ain't turned into a pepperoni pizza!
Well, you can just drift, hum hole!
The sock ain't foolin' anyone!
Poor girl. You know, l've seen this movie where this haunted car flames guys out.
Yeah! Wonder what the hell shorted out the electrical system.
- This starter's totally shot!
- l swear somebody's got it in for you, Mikey.
- lt pisses me off.
- l remember this ''Mannix''.
These dudes are after another dude so they put dynamite in the first dude's car.
- When he turns the ignition...
- He gets flamed, right?
- You seen it too?
- Oh, Vinnie!
What's this piece of junk? l don't know. l found that at old Dawson Field.
Figured l'd pass it off as my science project.
Well, good luck. You'll need it.
Yeah. Thanks for helping me out, Vinnie.
No sweat. See ya at the brain fest tomorrow.
- OK. Take it easy.
- Yeah, 'night.
Good night.
Somebody's definitely got it in for you, Mikey.
- Yeah? Like who?
- Some low-octane type. Crystal, maybe.
Right.
Vinnie?
Holy sh...
- Look at this!
- My God!
- You all right?
- Yeah.
- What do you think it is?
- Could be an engine.
But an engine to what? l wonder what this thing runs on.
Unleaded.
- Maybe premium!
- Shut up, Vinnie!
Holy smoke! My box! Ga...
- What happened?
- l don't know. Brand-new batteries.
- Yeah.
- That pisses me off.
Go get that battery. l wanna run some juice through this.
All right. Move, move.
- OK, hook it up.
- Why me? lf it blows up in your face you've got nothin' to lose. OK, move outta the way.
Where shall l put this? l don't know. Be careful.
Shit!
- Put that thing out! lt'll blow up.
- l'm getting outta here.
Holy smoke!
What's it doing? Vince!
What was that noise?
- Look, look, look.
- Yeah! Disconnect it!
You disconnect it. l'll watch.
What's it doing?
Vince?
Weird!
We're hallucinating, right?
No ''Outer Limits'' l ever seen had this stuff before. What do we do?
We disconnect it. Come on.
You disconnect it. l'll watch.
- Go ahead. l'll stand guard.
- Yeah.
OK.
Mike, remember the show in which the Egyptian vase just...
Give it a rest. OK, Vince?
Yeah, sure. l'm cool. Yeah.
- Yeah, we're working on the car.
- l don't work on the car.
- Should we tell sombody...?
- No. Not yet.
The science final! Grab that thing!
Just grab it! Come on!
Put that on there.
- That's good.
- OK. Come on.
That's weird.
Wait a second. lt's gotta be wrong.
So how come everybody's leaving like school's over?
- l don't know.
- Stay tuned.
- We went two hours into the future.
- What?
Sherm! How's life in the fat lane?
Vince Latello, comedian.
You guys lost or something?
We're not lost, Sherman.
We came for...a book.
- A car book?
- No, not a car book.
A book about...strange things.
- Like Vince?
- Sayonara, big nose. Hold me back.
Take it easy. Look, Sherman, we just want this book. Help us out, OK?
- OK.
- OK.
What kind of strange things?
Well...sort of like stuff...
Stuff vanishes then stuff comes in from other times, but you can't touch the stuff.
- 'Cause it kinda disappeared.
- Like you if you flap your fish lips again!
- That sounds like magic which is section...
- No, magic's make-believe.
Yeah, we're talking about the flip side of reality.
Well, this is the science section. lt's about as real as you can get.
What's the title?
What?
Author.
- l don't know.
- Well, what's it about?
Monsters, flying lawn-mowers, weird shit!
No, no. lt's about these two guys, right?
They go into this room and these things come in and out of the walls.
- Sounds weird all right.
- See, these guys leave this room.
- lt's two hours into the future.
- Only it felt like ten minutes to the two guys.
That sounds like we're dealing with a time-space warp.
- A time-space what?
- Warp. A time-space warp.
- How does it work?
- Simple. lt's kinda like breaking through the barriers between time, space and all dimensions.
You mean outer space?
Yeah. Right.
- So, they're all connected?
- Precisely.
They coexist within the same space on different planes of reality, that's all.
So, like, something could warp in from one dimension to another?
- Sure, but only if the warp got outta control.
- Outta control how?
Einstein theorised it would take great power to break through a barrier.
The danger is, once you unleash the power, you'd lose control of it.
- Yeah, and then what?
- Earth's energy field would go crazy.
A chain reaction could start.
Weather could change.
And boom! You're all cosmic dust!
- Hey, Mike. Banks!
- What?
We point the gizmo at the greenery. Bammo! lt vanishes into our car. We make a fortune!
Your pilot light is out.
- Well, what do we do with it?
- lt's my science project, remember?
Turn it in, get my diploma and kiss this school goodbye.
- You're pullin' my zucchini.
- You got a better suggestion?
Yeah. l say we sell it to ''60 Minutes''.
''60 Minutes''?
- See ya.
- There he is. Bob!
- Listen, about the...
- You cut my science final. Where were you?
- ln the auto shop.
- ln the ozone. ln the ozone, blow zone! l'm tired of you four Fs. l'll tell you one thing, unless your project is dyno-supreme, you both get Ds.
- Hey, l'll take it.
- l wanted to talk about my science project.
Maybe you'd come by and take a look at it. l'm off to an anti-war alumni meeting and l'm late. Can you dig it?
- You're the only one who'd understand this.
- Don't bet on it.
- Give us a break.
- All right.
- l'll be here grading papers at nine o'clock.
- Nine o'clock?
What are we fighting for?
Don't ask me I don't give a damn
Next stop is Vietnam
So how come you didn't tell him?
- We got a door to the ''Twilight Zone''?
- You're gonna blow his doors off with this!
- Yeah. You got any change, Vinnie?
- School tax, jellyfish. Come on.
Here. Drift!
He had to take a leak.
- Hello.
- Hey, EIIie, It's me, MichaeI,
- Hi, Michael.
- WouId you Iike to go out tonight?
- Sure. l'd like to.
- CouId you bring your camera?
- My camera?
- To take pictures,
We're not going to a junkyard, are we?
To a great life.
You're all mine.
You're all mine.
- What the hell happened here?
- Oh, Mike!
How do you like the colour scheme?
Delores did it.
You remember Delores?
Hello, Michael. lt's so lovely to see you again.
Lovely. Lovely. l hardly recognise the place. l know we shouldn't have gone off to Reno to get married like lovesick puppies!
Don't worry, sugarplum. l'll have a talk with him.
You are going to socialise with your new stepmother.
Do l make myself clear?
Stepmother?!
Quiet, Skipper.
Eyes right!
Burn it!
Any time, Vinnie.
Vinnie?
Open sesame!
Watch out, watch out.
What is this? Night school?
- Something's going on around here.
- What did they rip off in the auto shop?
''Who's the father of the H-bomb?
Boy George.''
That's nuclear power for ya.
- Sorry we're late.
- l'd given up on you guys. l really appreciate this. Here it is.
What is it? Put it on the table. l'll get a look at it.
You don't know what it is? l'm just testing you guys!
Yeah.
OK. Now, watch this.
Press these two things, right?
See those lights?
Weird!
- Yeah.
- Listen when l pull these levers out.
And back.
Pretty amazing, huh, Bob?
- lt's incredible, huh?
- Psychedelic!
- Go on. Touch it.
- Yeah?
Go ahead.
What we should do first is find out what metal this is.
Here we go.
Have you seen my neo-spector?
Let's just... lt's unreal. l mean... lt doesn't... lt doesn't show up on our metal spector. l mean, it's some sort of... lt's some sort of power plant.
Hear that, Mike? lt's an engine!
- An engine for what?
- Wait, where did you guys dig this up?
- Michael found it at the...
- No. l found it at the... at the old junk yard outside of town,
Sam's place. l'd like to know whose it was.
This is generating power and light without heat, Michael.
- How is that possible?
- lt's not possible. l mean, not on this world, anyway.
Whoa! What world are we talking about?
- lt's broken.
- Vinnie, get that battery.
Wait. Bob, why would that be broken?
Because if it isn't broken, Michael, this is older than Earth. All right?
Bob, wait until you see this.
Hook it up, Vinnie.
- No. You hook it up.
- l did it last time..
- l'm not going near this thing.
- Vinnie, please...
Wait! l'll hook it up.
OK, Bob. lt goes on these things.
All right.
- Look at that.
- Wow! l seen lights like this at a Ozzy Osbourne concert.
Can you imagine the advanced alien civilisation that created this? l mean, this is...
This is bigger than all of us.
This is... This is bigger.
Bigger than any of us.
This is bigger than the planet. lt's... lt's even bigger than the solar system.
Bob, is this like when you said we could smoke banana peel?
Oh, ye of little faith!
- What is it, Bob?
- l'll tell you what it is. lt's a time-space warp that's created by this gizmo and we can travel through time and space.
Yeah? Let's call ''People'' magazine.
No. l vote we tell the police.
The pigs? No pigs! No. No!
- Unhook it, Vince.
- No!
Don't you touch that, Vince. lt's an implosion meltdown.
Whoa. lt slimed out the battery.
- What shall we do, Bob?
- l'll show you what we'll do.
Who hit the lights? What's going on?
Forget it. Let's do it anyway. Come on.
All right! Let's do it! Let's go!
- Mr Roberts!
- What's going on?
The dimension barriers.
They're breaking away. lt is! lt is a gateway.
- Disconnect it, Vinnie.
- No, Mike. You disconnect it!
You don't know what you're looking at.
You don't know what you see. lt's pure time.
Pure space...
- Michael, don't listen. Stop this!
- Stop it! l'm at the headquarters of creation. l feel the whole universe in my fingertips.
- Mr Roberts!
- No! Bobby! l feel... l feel... the Earth, infinity, what a rush!
- No!
- What a ride!
Oh, God!
What happened to him?
A souvenir! lt's Christmas time!
Look at that! lt's like ''The Blob''. The more power, the stronger it gets. What's goin' on?
All right! Do it!
- Hey!
- lt's Harlan. Let's run!
Mikey, the warp. We gotta stop the warp.
Yeah.
Michael, is Bob dead?
- l don't know.
- Great! There goes my D.
What are we gonna do?
- We'll stop it ourselves.
- What? lf we break the connection, the gizmo can't reach the power station.
- Nobody'll know anything.
- So what's the plan?
We black out town.
Black out town!
- But how?
- Blow up the power lines.
De-mo-lition!
Keep it down. The old man's upstairs.
- Michael, isn't this a bit dangerous?
- Think of the fun!
- Come on, Vinnie.
- Vinnie!
Vinnie! Come on! Come on!
- Mikey, dust it off!
- l'm movin'.
Michael, it's coming! Hurry!
Come on! Dynamite!
- Dynamite!
- You know what you're doin'?
Sure! We do it all the time in Brooklyn!
Mikey, l thought you had more under the hood than this!
Go, baby! Go! Go!
Come on, baby. Come on!
- Hit the blower.
- OK. Hold on!
Whoa! Now we are talking hyperspace!
Michael, this is too fast for me.
Don't worry. lt's like a ride in Disneyland.
Hold on!
- Mikey, we've done it!
- We did it!
Brake!
Now, that was a ride!
OK. This is it. Let's go. l kinda feel like Gregory Peck in ''The Guns Of Navarone''.
- Latello!
- All right! Hold your horses here!
Caps to the dynamite. Dynamite to the legs.
Caps to the dynamite. Dynamite to the legs.
- Vince?
- Caps to the legs. Legs to the dynamite.
- Come on!
- Good thing l watch TV, huh?
- Come on! Ellie, hurry up.
- OK. l'm gettin' outta here!
Here!
- Hook it up.
- You hook it up.
- Latello, come on!
- OK. Chill out!
Legs! Legs!
- Please, Michael! Do it!
- OK. Get down. Come on! Ready?
- My car battery.
- Car battery!
Open! Come on! Open!
- Get back!
- Get down!
We did it!
Come on. Let's go.
How do we get the gizmo outta school past the fuzzballs?
Damn!
Police!
Those maggots!
Come on!
- Don't you think we should tell the police?
-Tell them what?
- We sent our science teacher into a warp.
- What are we gonna do?
- One to five with good behaviour.
- Vinnie!
- This is me!
- Yeah, OK.
So! You're cool! l'm cool! We're cool!
Thank you. Good night.
Good night.
Do you copy? ,,across the county tonight, and the deIiberate dynamiting of power Iines by unknown individuaIs,
PoIice hope to have more to report soon,
This concIudes our speciaI buIIetin,
You know, l...
..l can't stop thinking about Bob.
Neither can l. l'm really scared, Michael. l mean, what is this thing? l don't know.
Whatever it is, wherever it's from, it's over with now, OK?
- We stopped it, so don't worry about it.
- OK.
My parents are gonna have a hormonal disturbance! l've gotta go.
Good night.
Ellie?
Ellie? l was... l was just thinkin'.
How come we spent four years in the same class and never even talked to each other? l don't know.
Maybe because... you lived under cars and...l lived in books.
Yeah.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
You're right, you know.
About what?
Just about...me being better with cars than with people. l guess it's 'cause l trust them more than l do people.
Maybe you've just been trusting the wrong people, Michael.
Yeah.
Maybe l have been.
My retainer.
Sorry!
Hey, Skipper, how ya doin'?
Watch it, boy!
Welcome home, kid.
- Where you been?
- Who the hell are you? l'm the long arm of the law, the public conscience, Detective Jack Nulty. l didn't do nothin'.
Hey, Dad. What is all this? l told Detective Nulty everything about the break-in but he insisted on talking to you.
Well, hell, yeah! l haven't had a real good case in a long time. l ain't about to piss this one away.
Know what l mean, kid?
Yeah. That's your job, right?
- That's what l like to hear.
- l'm gonna take care of everything.
You need a court order for this!
What's the charge?
No charge - yet.
Three eye-witnesses put you at the school tonight.
There's this little business about stolen dynamite, and where's your pal?
That ex-yippie science teacher,
Bob Roberts?
- l don't know.
- That a fact?
- Yeah....
- Tell you what.
- Let's take a ride down to the station.
- What for?
- l'm enjoying the conversation.
- l'm going with you.
Bring your wife, your kids, the whole family.
- Can l get my jacket? ls that OK, mister?
- Fine by me.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hello. ..Michael?
Bring the gizmo to the poIice station,,,
Bring the gizmo to the police sta...? Michael!
- l demand...
- Mr Latello. Mr Harlan.
- This is Sergeant Jones.
- Tax dollars at work!
- Give me your name.
- Latello's a delinquent anyway, but don't...
- Mike.
- Tell him all your personal information.
- Don't do it.
- Michael Harlan.
- That's him!
- Kiss your asses goodbye!
- That'll be enough outta you, Meatball.
- Chill out, Mr Spock!
- l don't know what l'm doin' here.
- Tell me a fairy story about this, boys.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law.
- OK, McCloud!
- You have the right to an attorney.
- Ellie!
- Sherman! What are you doing here?
Seeing what Harlan and Vince are up to. l'm warning you, Ellie, they are in big trouble.
You'd better leave before the police find out you're involved. l'll cover for you.
- l'll say Harlan forced you...
- Sherman, get outta my way.
Wait! So this is what they were talking about!
- lt's none of your business.
- What is this thing?
Leave it alone. lt's dangerous.
You could wind up in a...
Another dimension?
This is amazing.
- lt's absolutely incredible.
- Sherman.
- Sherman, just give it to me.
- l can't believe it!
No!
- Hi, Mom.
- You little cockroach.
- What? l got boogers?
Hey, kid.
Why do you wear sunglasses at night?
When you're cool, the sun shines on you 24 hours a day.
Oh, yeah?
Chill out, Butch! And get a shave.
The gizmo.
What the hell happened here?
- Ellie's at the school. We've gotta get her.
- Let's jam! Let's jam!
My prisoners! Come back here!
Where are my god-damn prisoners?
- Vinnie!
- l've always wanted to do this.
- Meet me at the school.
- You got it.
Yeah!
- Head boy Sherman!
- What are you doing here?
- lt's not my fault.
- Where's Ellie?
- l didn't know.
- Where is she?
She's in the tower.
The school's in the warp. lt's the end of the world.
- Cheerful, ain't he?
- You comin' or not?
- OK. OK.
- Where you goin'? l'm comin'!
But if l wind up in another dimension like Bobarino, l'm goin' in there packin'!
Good luck!
This is no time to be sittin' around sucking snot! After you, lunch meat!
No! We'll never come back!
Somethin' tells me we ain't in Kansas no more, Toto!
See? l told you guys.
The warp's expanding.
Look, it's people from the past and the future.
And we're all here together!
This is like a...
This is like a crossroads of time and space.
- Yeah.
- Wow! l don't believe this. Do you, Mike?
- No.
- Unreal!
Radar her!
- Vinnie, keep it under control, all right?
- Danger makes great sex!
- l'll check you guys out later.
- Come on!
These are optical delusions like ghosts, so it's cool. Here comes Latello!
- Help me!
- Vince!
Son of a bitch!
What do you call this, wawa?
Actually, l think you'd call it a Neanderthal man. l don't care what country he's from.
One shot and he's down. l don't believe this.
- l could be watching ''Magnum''.
- Stop whining!
Whining?
Barney Rubble just tried to flame me out.
- You guys, wait up!
- Vinnie, come on!
Hey, scope that faggot in the tutu!
- Paisano!
- We're friends, all right? Friends.
- What's he saying?
- He's going to kick our ass.
Come on!
- He's dead.
- He's been dead a billion years.
Hey, Mike, you OK?
- Yeah.
- Come on, Sherman. Help him up.
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.
Legs! Legs!
- Are we in trouble!
- The warp's getting stronger.
Get down.
Get down!
- Exchange students!
- Latello!
Come on.
- Vietcong.
- Sh!
- We're out.
- What?
- lt's empty.
- Give me that.
- Back me up, all right?
- You got it.
- Get their guns! Come on!
- Huh? That's OK. Don't get up!
Optical delusions, Latello!
- Thanks. l owe you one.
- Yeah. Take it easy.
Ciao!
Let's rest here for a while.
Hey, round boy.
How d'you learn to fight so good?
Cliff Notes, Latello!
How do you work these things?
Well, according to
''Stoddard's Guide To Modern Weaponry'', you eject the spent clip, you pop the fresh clip into the chamber...
..pull back the cocking mechanism and you're ready to rock 'n' roll!
What he say?
Come on.
Go ahead! Make my semester!
Very smart, Latello!
Latello!
Come on. Put it down.
Would you put it down?
- Who are these guys?
- Mutants from after the apocalypse.
Let's get outta here.
- Come on!
- l don't need this.
We're gonna get flamed by something that don't exist yet!
Not in our dimension, but with relativity...
- Relativity? Shut up, you fat toad.
- Come on, Vinnie!
- lf it weren't for him we wouldn't be here.
- Look, up the stairs and we're at the lab.
- Yeah. Or on flippin' Pluto!
Come on!
- What is that?
- l don't know.
My ears are ringing like the ''Gong Show''. l can't hear nothing.
And l don't see that neither.
- Sherman?
- Got me, Mike.
Terrific! The answer man is stumped.
This plant has been extinct for 60 million years.
Yeah? Well, l ain't never seen one before.
- You gonna make it, Vinnie?
- Me? l'm so scared l'm thinkin' about God. lt's God-funking-zilla!
Get down.
- l just don't believe it.
- l just want to be home watchin' cartoons.
Stop talking, OK?
- Sherman!
- Asshole! lt's my allergies. l've had it. l'm goin' in. Back me up!
- Vinnie! What are you doing?
- Come and get me!
Latello!
Suck lead, lizard!
Vinnie!
No! What?
Vinnie!
Vinnie!
- You OK?
- Yeah. l think so.
- Where's Vinnie?
- l don't know.
- Vinnie!
- Oh, man!
Oh, man. Mikey!
- Oh, my arm.
- Come on. l got ya.
- 1 7 years of TV down the drain.
- Yeah. l got ya. Come on.
- There you go.
- My leg!
All right! The cheque's in the mail!
Let's go!
One question, what now?
We get Ellie and get outta here. Let's go!
What are you doin'? Let's go! Ready?
Ready!
Hit the dirt!
- Cover me.
- Don't get too close to the gizmo, Mike.
Ellie!
- He's been sucked up.
- Shut up. You're making me nuts.
You're making me crazy!
Ellie?
Ellie?
- Look, he's got her, Sherman.
- He's got her!
- ls she OK?
- She don't look too good, Sherman.
Ellie?
- Ellie, l'm so sorry. lf l only knew...
- OK, Sherman.
- Can you walk?
- The question is, can you run?
Yeah. Yeah, l can.
OK. Let's go. Come on.
Yeah. Fine.
- We got company.
- Who is it?
- lt ain't the Brady Bunch!
- We're not home! l gotta stop it. Take my gun.
- Sherman.
- Michael!
Ellie, get back!
- Michael!
- Ellie, get back here! Ellie!
He's gone, l know. Michael!
Michael!
Oh, no!
Michael!
Michael!
No.
- He's gone.
- Mike?
Mike! He's back!
Michael.
Michael, are you OK?
Yeah. l think so.
Are you? l am now!
Mikey, this is no time for romance here.
Scaramouche! Let's go!
You thought you heard what?
Watch out.
Come on, clear out of here. lt's dangerous.
Keep moving. Stand back.
You know, Sherman? You're all right.
For a wimp virgin, l mean.
Coming from a greaseball like you, l take that as a real compliment.
Listen.
No one says nothin' about this. OK?
Yeah, OK.
All right.
- OK, kids. Get outta here.
- Easy, easy. l'm comin'!
- So it's out, right?
- Hell, no! We won't go!
Hell, no! We won't go! Chicago!
- Mr Roberts?
- Bob?
Flower-power children,
Beatle concerts, anti-war rallies. l'll be dipped in shit!
- What happened?
- l was blasting through on a tour of the '60s. l didn't know what even to say, man! l mean tripping trip, man!
- What's your name, cowboy?
- Robert Roberts Esquire to you, honky!
That a fact? Well, Miss Esquire, where the hell have you been?
Woodstock - oinker!
- Woodstock?
- What's Woodstock?
- OK, Captain Kirk.
- lt's not Boston Pops!
- You got an A in your science project.
- l do?
On one condition. Get rid of the gizmo.
The world is not ready for space and time. lt's only for such rare individuals as myself.
And the future is a groove, man! l made sure of that. lt's a funky high!
- Get in the car.
- Easy on the fringe, Kojak!
We're outta gas.
Well, it's lucky we're close to town. l mean, we can walk it.
Wait a second, Michael. lf we walked into town, the world would know that your car broke... lt's just a car.
Right?
Right.
What are you looking at?
Girls, what's for lunch?
Hey, girls! Boola! Boola!
- Dykes.
- You little weasel!
Phil, when did you take this one?
A couple of weeks ago.
Phil, that's impossible.
This man can't still be alive.
He's covered in tumors from head to foot.
May I take a sample?
This ground is sacred.
- We're both doctors, you know.
- Sacred ground!
No person but the Zambuli has ever seen it before.
My God, it's true.
The healing earth exists!
The source has got to be inside Gudjara Mountain.
Let's have a shot at it.
I have the wobblies.
Remember what Chief Haromba said?
Yes, caves are strange.
They can have weird echo effects.
But you know as well as I do, Betts, echoes don't kill people.
Mommy!
Mom!
We'll take a sample here.
Mommy!
Janet?
The prophecy has come to pass.
On a day when the sacred mountain cries out...
...a golden God-child shall come from the depths of Gudjara.
And she shall grow in wisdom and be the protector of the Zambulis...
...and all their creatures.
And she shall be called
Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.
Sleep now, little daughter.
This long day is over.
Much to learn, more to forget.
This is Shaba, the water horse.
It came to me!
Small person summons small creature.
You will grow, my daughter.
Are you all right?
A thousand, thousand moons ago...
...before She-Who-ls-Unknown taught us peace...
...the Zambulis were great archers.
You will recall this when your time comes.
When will that be, Shaman?
I cannot say, Sheena.
But there will be great trouble over the land.
You will know it when it comes.
- Good morning, your Highness.
- Hi, baby!
- Tell Mr. Grizzard I'm on my way up.
- Right away.
- You've got it?
- Right here.
It's confirmation of the sample from the geo-satellite.
It's titanium all right!
Look at that, see that?
The Gudjara Mountain.
It's practically made of it!
There are billions in there for you...
And me, Prince. Right?
Burn it!
You mean it's on for tonight?
Yes!
Historically speaking, killing a king has often brought bad luck.
Especially when he's your brother.
It's the only way.
He has this thing about the Zambulis.
Nobody steps on their turf.
- As long as he's king...
- Yeah, I know. No mining on Zambuli land.
Here's your prescription, Grizzy.
Take them after a meal.
I've added a cute touch, by the way.
You know those TV guys who are coming?
My pal, Vic Casey.
- What about him?
- Story on me for Sportsworld.
They'll be there tonight.
They'll catch my act on film.
- Sounds pretty risky.
- Not a bit!
My grief will break your heart.
- I don't like it!
- Trust me, man.
I'm the guy who kicked a 68-yard field goal against the Denvers!
Who can stop me?
Shaman, we're not camping here?
You make camp.
This is the end of our Zambuli lands.
- From here, I walk alone.
- Please, don't go.
I must go. The city is a place of evil.
I've never visited one in my life.
But you know I must go there to warn the king.
Are you sure he is in danger?
One is sure of nothing.
But I had the vision again last night.
I saw him lying in his own blood.
Our lands destroyed by a strange flame.
The heart torn from our sacred mountain of Gudjara.
This cannot be.
Who would kill such a good king?
An enemy. One who takes without asking.
Embrace me now.
My heart goes with you, Shaman.
And my fear.
Keep the fear inside you.
I carry enough of my own.
I lost count. How many have I had so far?
Six or seven?
You're going down the drain, Fletch.
You're right. Twenty pounds or else.
How's this for an opening shot?
We'll start in close on the tee.
You're kidding.
The King of Tigora is gonna bend down and hold the football for a place kick?
When it's his brother Otwani kicking for national television, he will.
Good luck.
I know you're pals with Otwani, but he...
Holy shit!
Look, right down there by the falls!
Where are we now? What are we by?
Tigora, sir.
Near the end of Zambuli territory.
Any white folk here?
No, very black!
King Jabalani keeps even us Tigorans out of Zambuli land.
I'll bite, what did I miss?
You're not gonna believe this, Vic.
I just saw a blonde!
A blonde what?
A blonde. A girl!
She was swinging in the trees!
You mean a blonde gorilla?
I know the difference between a gorilla and a girl!
You know, I'm worried.
Eight thousand miles from home, my cameraman's mind has gone to mush...
...on some whacked-out water diet!
I know what I saw.
I know you did, and I believe you.
Page 4. Any problem with the setup?
Here's your prescription, Grizzy, take them after a meal.
My man! What's happening!
My buddy!
Bad man of the Cougars!
How are you doing?
Astonishing. Is that the normal greeting in your country?
It's called a "high five." Try it.
I'm Vic Casey.
Welcome to Tigora, Mr. Casey.
I'm King Jabalani.
Oh, Jesus. Excuse me.
I found it tingling and delightful.
Our intended bride, Princess Zanda.
Cool!
Please follow us, Mr. Casey.
Fletch, get the bags, will you?
What's wrong? Are you lost?
I am not. Do I look lost?
You look like a Zambuli.
That is true. I am their shaman.
I have journeyed many days to Azan.
Where do I find the king?
So you want the king?
I've told you that already. Take me to him.
You're coming with us.
You would prefer the head of the table for yourself, dear brother?
Not at all.
I have heard a strange rumor.
The cellar of the Grand Hotel has armed guests.
Extremely strange.
You think someone's planning a revolution?
I think it would be very wise if you were to look into this.
Why are you here? You know it's not safe.
Mary, run to the Grand Hotel.
Tell Colonel Jorgenson I said to keep his head down for a few hours.
Yes, Sir.
He's discovered something?
Nothing serious. Relax.
Did you hear the Zambuli shaman has come to town?
Of course I've heard. I've had her arrested.
Are you crazy? Why?
What if Jabalani finds out?
He never will.
A Zambuli Bow.
A dead king.
And a Zambuli shaman to hang for it!
What could be neater?
You're pretty good.
You're so wrong.
I am the most wicked woman in Tigora.
Marika!
I can't believe it!
Dinner at the palace, right?
I'm supposed to have cheese today.
I bet they have breadfruit and lasagna.
Be good for you.
Excellent preventative against seeing imaginary blondes!
I'm telling you she was not imaginary!
I know a girl when I see one!
What was she doing in the jungle?
Her junior year abroad?
We missed our floor.
Tell me again. At the airport you saw a helicopter gunship?
No! Our story is about a guy who kicks 60-yard field goals...
...and his brother is a king. That's it!
Center pic. Good, hold it there.
Higher up. Good.
Right, come on, Fletch, follow the pigs.
Watch the boobs coming into the right of your frame.
Boobs? What kind of talk is that?
As in tits. Zanda, the king's sweetie.
We're for network, remember?
I see what you mean!
Boy, do I see what you mean!
Okay, follow the pigs.
- Jammed!
- Clear it, I need this shot!
A toast, dear friends.
A toast to our beloved brother,
Prince Otwani.
May his exploits with his royal foot...
...lead him to that curious American glory, which I confess, puzzles me completely...
- Got it.
- Go.
..."Superbowl champions"!
Give me another magazine, quick!
Take this to the lab!
Start it through the soup, go on!
A Zambuli arrow!
It's a Zambuli woman.
We caught her with a bow.
No, Otwani! You are the king now.
You are quite right, Princess Zanda.
We'll leave her to the hangman.
Nairobi, Capetown...
Okay, that's got it.
I don't give a damn, just tell me where I can rent a Learjet!
Baby, you are talking to a man in pain.
I am sitting on an Emmy and I can't get it out!
- You know what that means?
- Sounds like he needs a laxative!
Here's the piece where the camera jammed.
No, 86 that, it was off the action.
Look at it first.
There might be a good frame or two.
Look at it first.
What is this?
I don't know.
Let's look at it on the viewer.
Vic, take a look at this.
Right down in there.
Well, whatever it is, it's in a tree.
Look. There's the branch.
I'll run it ahead a bit.
Now, what's that line going across there?
Looks like a scratch.
That's no scratch, it's an arrow coming out of that tree...
...going in just the right direction to kill the king.
And that is a steel crossbow firing it.
And that's not a Zambuli bow, for sure!
Jesus, kid, if you're right, you just got your union card!
"Top of the news," the man says.
"Dan Rather time."
We could get killed doing this!
I'm talking about bullets through the head!
Let's just turn around and go back.
All right, Fletch, you're absolutely right.
First plane in the morning, I promise.
I want to interview that Zambuli woman they've got locked in jail first.
Not only is he suicidal, he's crazy!
They're not going to let us just walk up in there, you know.
I have a pass.
A what? Let me see it!
What are you waiting for?
- The battery has gone dead!
- Too bad!
We'll start with an establishing shot, then I want to zoom in on the gate.
Back when we played "doctor," that's what we called a girl. A blonde!
Fletch, I apologize! Roll, roll it!
- Vic, that's jungle up ahead.
- Sure looks like it.
I'm a city boy.
I get paranoid going to zoos!
Close your eyes.
We are ready to go.
Mission: Find and kill!
It's your neck if that shaman lives to talk.
And ditto for Mr. Casey if he's made contact and got her story.
Consider them dead.
And the girl.
I want to see her alive.
She sounds interesting.
Not to me! You will kill her on sight,
Colonel Jorgenson!
Cool it! No women's lib stuff around here,
I give the orders!
With them finished, it's on to Gudjara full speed.
What's wrong?
Hoof prints.
Running, I think.
- How many toes has a zebra got, if any?
- He thinks he's the Last of the Mohicans!
I could sue you for kidnapping and you're bugging me about zebra toes?
All right!
I admit we have as much chance of finding her here as a McDonalds.
But Fletch, we both saw her.
And while there's hope...
Nice kitty, nice.
Heel.
Make that plural.
Your friends?
Do you want to die?
No.
Then go back! Tell the rest of your evil, killing tribe not to hunt us!
You will remain here to be sure he obeys me.
Get out!
I don't think so.
They understand you?
Of course!
Who are you?
I am Sheena.
I'm Vic Casey.
I cold-cocked that guard when he was about to shoot you.
Remember?
You will be safe inside the circle.
Do not cross it.
Kibor, you stay here!
Hey, where are you going?
Who is that girl?
You okay?
Where are we?
Central Park. Why?
Thank God. I thought I was...
We really have to do something about this park!
It's getting worse all the time.
Your hand, it's so cold.
The flame departs.
Don't leave me.
I must, daughter.
My time is done, as yours is beginning.
It was foretold.
Sheena will protect the Zambulis at a time of great trouble.
She'll guard the sacred mountain...
...from the men who would tear out its riches.
How? What can one woman do against a man so strong...
...so evil as Otwani?
You're not alone.
I see a friend at your side.
Who? How will I know who it is?
How does one ever know?
You'll look at his eyes. You'll see.
You must go now.
Leave me in the home
Chango has made for me.
Shaman. Mother.
How soft, my daughter, how pleasing to me.
Your tears upon me, to extinguish the last embers.
My Sheena, my queen.
This is amazing!
It even keeps the mosquitoes out!
Now tell me. Why did you follow us?
We're storytellers, with pictures, too.
And, baby, have we got a story here!
Take me to that Zambuli woman you busted out of jail.
The shaman? You want to see her?
Yes, you see I know she didn't kill the king.
Let me carry her own words home with me and I can prove it to the whole world.
You must think I'm a fool.
Words are like the wind.
They cannot be carried home.
They can.
You must think I'm a fool.
Words are like the wind.
They cannot be carried home.
It bugs me, too.
Listen, why don't you just take him to your shammie... your shaman?
She's gone far ahead.
You will have to take a long journey with me.
I'd love to.
He sneaks back to Azan to ship out some film we left there.
- I go with you.
- I like it!
Anybody object?
There is danger!
Come on, let's go! Get in here!
Get the film!
Shit!
Climb.
Come on, Vic Casey.
Colonel...
...somebody slipped.
Yeah, he fell right here.
Did they go on?
I'm not sure.
Find out.
That's what you're being paid for.
- I asked you, did they go on?
- I already told you. I'm not sure.
All right.
We hike back to the vehicles.
We sure handled that okay.
Fletch, you shouldn't be in Azan.
They are looking for you!
I know.
They were at the lab a half-hour ago.
- You're probably going to be next!
- What?
How many have I had now? Let's see...
...three, no, I had six, seven...
I am going insane!
What is happening?
All right, Juka, you did it, you got it!
The village where I was born is only a few miles away.
We'll be safe there.
- Where is Vic?
- Don't ask!
Why don't you come in and wash?
You're as dirty as a wart hog!
No, I don't think so.
Water frightens you?
Well, no, not exactly.
Come in, Vic Casey, the water is cold!
It's so good for you!
Remove those strange skins you wear.
From what animal do they come?
The wild silk moth.
It roams in Bloomingdale's.
- Fur! You have fur!
- I have what?
The Zambuli men do not have fur on their bodies. This cannot be.
Would you go back in the water, please?
Why?
Red One to Hawk One, do you copy?
Hawk One copies Red One, over.
How's it coming?
Very good. Over.
What I want to hear is, "Very soon."
We will be safe here for a while.
They would never believe you could run over such rocks.
- Me?
- Of course. They know I can run anywhere.
Difficult on their feet.
I think we catch them now.
Wadman.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing is the matter. Tracks.
Zebra, deep.
- Must be carrying a heavy load.
- Somebody riding it, you mean?
Yeah.
- Maybe two people.
- Good.
Let's go!
Your hair smells fantastic!
What did you wash it with?
Zam Zam berries!
What else would a woman use?
Are your feet better now?
I think it's just possible
I might walk again sometime.
Sometime very soon.
Rest, Marika. Eat.
I will summon you again soon. Go ahead.
Come on, Vic Casey.
The dry season.
They cannot find anything to eat.
That big one in front, he's looking at me.
That's a cow, Vic Casey.
All the big ones are cows.
They wouldn't eat you if you were the last thing on earth.
Sheena, where did you learn all this?
Shaman taught me.
She told me everything.
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
I sat up last night.
You talked in your sleep.
I know she's gone.
Then why do you still travel with me?
You said it was to find the shaman, to catch her words in your box.
I did want to. That was the truth.
But since then, I've found other reasons.
Say what you mean.
It's called chemistry.
Say what you mean. Stop using words you know I do not understand.
Do you understand that?
No.
Mouths were given us to eat with.
Why did you touch yours to mine?
There's your 10, and I'll raise you 10 more.
Sorry, Gramps. Queens full.
You lose!
Mombassa straight beat full house.
This pile of junk?
All red color!
One jack, rest of cards all even number.
Mombassa straight!
Otwani has cut the long lines.
No calls outside Tigora.
- And the airports?
- Closed. No airplanes.
But the bastards are working awful hard to fix the gun-chopper.
Jesus!
Vic!
These Zambulis of yours, do they have guns?
Never! Guns are bad. Arrows!
Against machine guns?
Against armored cars?
A thousand, thousand moons ago, they were the greatest of all warriors.
Before She-Who-ls-Unknown brought peace to every creature.
It is told!
You make me want to cry.
For what?
Just everything.
These are good. We'll eat here.
We need strength.
Tiki saw something. Wait here.
Sheena.
Look through these.
Try them, they're magic.
Bad magic!
They've made you into a pygmy!
Try the other end.
Vic Casey, you are a giant!
Occasionally.
We'll blow it up!
All right, get some plastics and blow the damned thing up!
Chango has stopped them.
The soldier wagons drink water.
- Gasoline. How far back?
- An hour's running.
- An hour's running for you or me?
- You.
That's way too close.
Come on, we have to get out of here.
All right, get behind the vehicles. Move!
Fletch, you are drinking from two glasses now?
That's right, because there's two of me to get smashed!
- Two of you?
- Yeah.
Fletch Number 1: He says,
"Go on up to Central Park, find Vic!"
Fletch Number 2:
He says, "To hell with that fool.
"Walk across the border, get the film out and get myself an Emmy."
Cheers.
- How many have I had now?
- Fletch Number 1...
...if you want to go up into the park,
I know the greatest tracker in Tigora.
I don't.
I'd rather jump off the Brooklyn Bridge.
Where is he?
This is murder!
These thorn trees are our friends.
They will let us rest for the night in safety.
What do you mean?
The soldier wagons must come through here.
Their round rubber feet will be wrecked to pieces.
This forest ends soon.
We will be at the Lake of Birds.
The Zambuli lands begin there.
Across those hills is Z'Kuru, the first Zambuli village.
My feet will be swifter when they're back on the sacred land.
You must be kidding! Swifter?
Such beauty!
Beyond belief.
I have been here at sunset 100 times.
And it has never moved me as it does tonight.
- Shall I tell you why?
- Please.
I am not a foolish young girl, Vic Casey.
The shaman taught me that brave tales do not always have happy endings.
I know what guns can do.
I know that you and I may not live to see another sunset.
- You are an enemy.
- I'm what?
The shaman taught me.
An enemy is one who takes without asking.
I'll ask then. May I?
Yes.
Hold it!
Refuel!
What's going on here?
These men got dragged through the thorn trees!
So bury them!
It was a tiring night.
The morale of the men is not good.
- A little killing is going to cheer them up.
- I don't understand.
We're in Zambuli territory.
Z'Kuru, next village. We hit it!
Their direct line of flight to Gudjara is here.
Z'Kuru is off to the side.
I don't care! We zap Z'Kuru!
Now, the message goes ahead by the jungle telegraph.
Those Zambulis up in Gudjara won't stop running till they hit Cairo!
It is good psychology.
It is good for the men.
Looks like you're going to enjoy it, too, Jorgie.
Oh, yeah.
You will be made welcome in Z'Kuru.
The headman's locust-bean cakes, they'll be your locust-bean cakes.
His fermented buffalo milk will be your fermented buffalo milk.
- His week-old dried...
- Please, I'm eating!
I will speak to the men of the time of arrows.
We will take our bows and attack the soldier wagons!
- What was that?
- An earthquake, maybe.
The land roars at Otwani.
- No!
- Let me see!
We'll beat the bastards to Gudjara somehow and sound a warning.
It's the only way to save their lives.
How can fire burn so hot?
How can even stone pots be made into ashes?
Gas, probably. Gasoline.
You spoke of that before.
The water the wagons drink.
You are wrong, Vic Casey.
Warning is not the only way to save people's lives!
What else can we do?
Stop Otwani!
Come!
Here's one with the sap dripping out.
Make flame.
Good.
You shape this with your blade.
I'll make fire grass.
- It is a good arrow.
- Yes, but it's front-heavy.
Yes, by three fingers.
They're coming!
It's the third truck from the front.
The one with the iron drums.
I see it. Get your flame ready.
Light it!
My God, you've done it!
Red One!
They're on the ridge! Go get them!
- It's circling away!
- For a better shot at us!
What do we do, Vic Casey?
The smart thing would be to stand up and wave this.
Your cloth. It's magic?
It destroys the firebird?
No, it says we give up.
We can make it to those trees down there.
Come on, run!
Hawk One to Red One.
Red One, what's taking you so long?
We're tracking them. They're in the trees.
Marika, warn them! Get them to safety.
Go!
Go!
Wait a minute, I spot their transport!
I swear to God, I'd do it all over again.
That pleases me.
I'm sorry.
There's so much I'd like to show you.
What would you show me?
I'd show you the view of the Trade Towers from my loft.
When you're walking down Wall Street at night eating a sack of peanuts.
Hell, forget them!
It is easy, because there is so much you did show me.
- Thank you, Vic Casey.
- You're thanking me?
The fire in my veins tells me I'm still alive.
I have not failed my people yet!
It's pretty amazing.
You've been on my turf all my life and I've never met you.
How have the Zambuli ever hurt you?
Why do you chain me?
I'm your king. I can do anything I want.
- Don't even think of it!
- I'll try not to.
- What would you do with her?
- She's protector of those savages, no?
That's her story.
I would fly her over Gudjara.
I would drop her in the great Zambuli Falls...
...with the whole tribe watching.
I like your imagination, Zanda.
You'll do it?
Sorry.
Take her away.
And bring us Mr. Casey.
You're a hard man to find, Vic, old pal.
You had it made, you asshole!
And then it got to you.
Got to me?
The cheering, the crowds.
The goddamn agents. Guys like me!
You had so much. You wanted it all.
Save that for Sunday school, Vic, old pal.
You should've stuck to your game plan.
When they put the rope around your neck, you'll wish I had.
Around my neck?
Hey, man, it's fourth down and 99 to go.
You're behind with five seconds left on the clock.
The ball bounces funny in the last two minutes.
You should see some film I shot.
- I'll watch Sportsworld very closely.
- It isn't going to be on Sportsworld.
I think it'll get a better rating at the Organization of African States.
Now, which shot is that?
Me kicking it over the palace roof?
Opens on a roast pig.
Segue into a tree, close shot, night.
Arrow zings from a catapult.
- Where are you taking me?
- Home!
We are leaving on a mission at once.
Sealed orders from King Otwani.
Now, where is this piece of film?
If you kill me, that film still goes out.
It's in Azan in safe hands.
Do you want a deal?
What do you propose?
You sign a treaty to be filed with the United Nations...
...giving independence to the Zambulis.
It buys you the negative.
You could be bluffing.
I'd have to see it first.
That's fair.
Okay, have someone drive him to Azan.
Bring him back with the film.
All right, Blau, take him.
No tricks, old pal.
Remember, I'm holding your jungle queen.
- That cuts both ways.
- Meaning?
Meaning anything happens to her while I'm gone, you bastard, you hang!
Lucky man.
I think he scored.
Any tips for me?
Jorgenson!
The film comes back.
Casey's ticket is one-way!
What the hell...
I see my death in your eyes.
Red One to Hawk One.
It was an accident.
Did I damage anything?
You really plan to throw me into the Zambuli Falls.
It won't hurt a bit.
It'll be over before you know it.
My head aches.
Your firebird makes such a noise.
Fly over the village.
Bring them all out for the show.
- They're following us. Back to the falls!
- Wilco.
Bank to the left so I can push her out!
- Get us out of here!
- There's no way!
See? Even in chains we can defeat them!
Turn your minds back, my people.
Remember yourselves a thousand, thousand moons ago!
Bring your bows!
Nice melody, huh?
Get out!
Leave!
Chief Haromba.
This is the edge of the Great Forest.
We shall wait for them here.
Now, Tiki, pass the word. Come on!
Column, halt! Stragglers!
Let's go get those bastards!
First, we secure Gudjara.
Otwani!
As long as I live,
Gudjara Mountain will not be yours!
After her!
- Straight ahead.
- She went off to the left!
- Straight ahead!
- I said, to the left!
- Chief Haromba.
- We are ready.
Hold it!
Let's get out of this damned forest!
Back up!
Attack!
Withdraw! Get them all!
Marika!
Z'Kuru!
I was only following orders.
For Z'Kuru!
Vic Casey.
Don't think about it.
How did you do?
They're all gone, dead!
Great!
- Me, too.
- No!
It's a funny thing about fatal burns...
They say there's no pain.
You're head is as clear as a bell.
I've had it, baby.
And all I can think of to say is, "Shit!"
Okay, I got the Mombassa straight, now this Zambesi flush.
That's three red cards, one black deuce and...
...a one-eyed jack, right?
- Jack got to be red.
Otherwise got to have three cards under nine, add up to...
Vic!
No!
- They're killing Vic!
- No, they're not!
- They're murdering him!
- No!
Tell me more about the places you will show me.
Where the jackals eat? Twenty-one?
I've changed my mind.
You're not seeing any of those places.
- You mean, you stay here?
- I can't.
I've got to take this earth home to be analyzed in a lab.
Maybe even duplicate it.
It might even be a cure for cancer.
Vic Casey.
I do not understand.
They'd kill you if they got their hands on you.
- Who would kill me?
- All of us!
You?
Hey, Vic!
Boy, are you guys hard to find! 'Morning.
We'd adore you to death.
With printed words, with moving pictures that go through the air...
...they'd put stiff hides on your feet.
Listen, Sheena baby, just move over a little bit so I can get you in the sun.
- Perfect...
- Let me see that a second.
It'll be really grainy when I blow it up...
What the hell are you doing?
We're talking an Emmy here! $1,000,000!
Fletch, get out of here!
A favor.
Forget the $1,000,000, huh?
I'll win it back from you when we play poker!
If the world finds out where the healing earth comes from, this is all gone.
You, the Zambulis, everything you've got going here.
What are you telling me, Vic Casey?
How much I love you, Sheena.
So much it busts my heart!
My heart breaks, also.
Put out the "Don't Disturb" sign, will you?
What?
Him.
Tell him we won't be disturbed for a few hours.
Will you return, Vic Casey?
Yes. Say it again.
I love you.
Again.
Must we waste this hour on words?
My father's name was John Kinsella.
It's an Irish name.
He was born in North Dakota in 1896...
...and never saw a big city...
...until he came back from France in 1918.
He settled in Chicago, where he learned
to live and die with the White Sox.
Died a little
when they lost the 1919 World Series...
...died a lot the following summer
when eight teammates...
...were accused of throwing that Series.
He played some in the minors,
but nothing came of it.
Moved to Brooklyn in '35...
...married Mom in '38...
...was already an old man
at the naval yards...
...when I was born in 1952.
My name's Ray Kinsella.
Mom died when I was 3,
and I suppose Dad did the best he could.
Instead of Mother Goose, I was put to bed
to stories of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig...
...and the great Shoeless Joe Jackson.
Dad was a Yankees fan then,
so I rooted for Brooklyn.
But in '58, the Dodgers moved away,
so we had to find other reasons to fight.
We did.
When it came time to go to college...
...I picked the farthest
from home I could find.
This drove him up the wall,
which, I suppose, was the point.
Officially my major was English,
but really it was the '60s.
I marched, I smoked some grass...
...I tried to like sitar music,
and I met Annie.
The only thing we had in common
was that she came from Iowa...
...and I'd once heard of Iowa.
After graduation,
we moved to the Midwest...
...and stayed with her family
as long as we could.
Almost a full afternoon.
Annie and I got married in June of '74.
Dad died that fall.
A few years later, Karin was born.
She smelled weird,
but we loved her anyway.
Then Annie got the crazy idea
that she could talk me into buying a farm.
I'm 36 years old, I love my family,
I love baseball...
...and I'm about to become a farmer.
But until I heard the voice...
...I'd never done a crazy thing
in my whole life.
If you build it, he will come.
If you build it, he will come.
Hey, Annie!
- Annie, what was that?
- What was what?
That voice just now. What was it?
We didn't hear anything.
All right.
If you build it, he will come.
- Okay, you must have heard that!
- Sorry.
Hey, come on in to dinner.
Let's go, pumpkin.
Is there a sound truck on the highway?
Nope. Hey, Karin, dinner's ready!
- Kids with a radio?
- Nope.
- Are you really hearing voices?
- Just one.
What did it say?
"If you build it, he will come."
- If you build what, who will come?
- He didn't say.
- I hate it when that happens.
- Me, too.
If you build it, he will come.
Build what? What is this?
It's okay, honey.
I'm just talking to the corn field.
Anyway, I was walking
down along the street...
...and I heard this voice saying...
..."Good evening, Mr. Dowd."
Well, I turned around...
...and here was this big six-foot rabbit
leaning up against the lamppost.
- Why did you do that? It was funny.
- Trust me. It's not funny.
The man is sick. Very sick.
Honey, get your book bag. Let's go!
I'll take her today.
I've got some errands to do in town.
Far-out.
- What if the voice calls while you're gone?
- Take a message.
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.
'Bye.
In all those years, did you ever...
It's just I've heard that sometimes farmers in the field...
They hear things. You know, voices.
- You hearing voices?
- No. It's just I heard some farmers do.
I, of course, don't, so I was wondering if I was doing something wrong.
Did you ever hear voices out there?
- Who's hearing voices?
- Ray is. Out in the fields.
No, I'm not.
I'm...
Noises.
That darned tractor...
I'm just going to get some 3-in-1oil.
That ought to do it.
Nice talking to you.
If you build it, he will come.
All right, that's it! Who the...
Who are you? What do you want from me?
Son of a bitch.
If you build it, he will come.
If you build it...
If you build it...
...he will come.
You don't suppose this is like an acid flashback?
I never took acid.
Maybe you will someday.
It's like a flash-forward.
Annie, there's more.
Honey, why don't you eat a little bit?
I think I know what
"If you build it, he will come" means.
Why do I not think this is such a good thing?
I think it means that if I build a baseball field out there...
...Shoeless Joe Jackson will come back and play ball again.
You're kidding?
You're kidding.
Boy, I thought my family was crazy...
...but this is the craziest thing
I've ever heard.
I know it's totally nuts.
- I mean, Shoeless Joe!
- He's dead. Died in '51. He's dead.
- They suspended him, right?
- Right.
- He's still dead?
- As far as I know.
Did you know Babe Ruth copied his swing?
If I did, I've forgotten it.
He was supposed to be so graceful and agile.
I'd actually like to see him play again...
...to let him play, to right an old wrong.
Wait. Wait a minute.
- Are you actually thinking of doing this?
- No.
I can't think of one good reason why I should, but...
I'm 36. I have a wife, a child, and a mortgage...
...and I'm scared to death
I'm turning into my father.
What does he have to do with all this?
I never forgave him for getting old.
By the time he was as old as I am now...
...he was ancient.
He must have had dreams, but he never did anything about them.
For all I know, he may have even heard voices, too...
...but he sure didn't listen to them.
The man never did one spontaneous thing in all the years I knew him.
I'm afraid of that happening to me...
...and something tells me this may be my last chance...
...to do something about it.
I want to build that field.
Do you think I'm crazy?
Yes.
But I also think if you really feel you should do this...
...then you should do it.
- What the hell is he doing?
- He's plowing under his corn.
Why?
Ty Cobb called him the greatest left fielder of all time.
He said his glove was the place where triples go to die.
- Could he hit?
- Could he hit?
Lifetime average .356, third highest in history.
Why'd they call him "Shoeless Joe"?
When he was in the minors...
...he bought a new pair of spikes and hurt his feet.
In the 6th inning, he took them off
and played in his socks.
The players kidded him, called him
"Shoeless Joe" and the name stuck.
He's going to lose his farm.
Damned fool.
Then in 1919,
his team the Chicago White Sox...
...threw the World Series.
- What's "threw"?
- It means they lost it on purpose.
Gamblers paid them to.
Except Shoeless Joe.
He did take their money,
but nobody ever proved he did one thing...
...to lose those games.
If he threw it, how do you explain that he hit .375 for the Series...
...and committed no errors?
I can't.
Twelve hits including the Series' only home run...
...and they said he's trying to lose?
It's ridiculous.
The commissioner of baseball
suspended eight of the players...
...including the great Shoeless Joe
Jackson, for life.
What's "suspend"?
It means they never
let him play the game again.
My father said he saw him years later...
...playing under a made-up name in some 10th-rate league in Carolina.
He'd put on 50 pounds, and his spring was gone from his step...
...but he could still hit.
Dad used to say nobody could hit like Shoeless Joe.
I think that's the first time
I've ever seen you smile...
...when you mentioned your father.
I have just created something totally illogical.
That's what I like about it.
Am I completely nuts?
Not completely.
It's a good baseball field, Ray.
It's kind of pretty, isn't it?
Any sign?
Something's going to happen out there.
I can feel it.
So, for the veteran southpaw,
his summer of woes continues.
That's four straight hits in the inning.
Daddy, what's a "southpaw"?
It means a left-handed pitcher, honey.
- So how bad is it?
- Well.
Considering how much less acreage we have for corn, I say we'll probably...
...almost break even.
We used up all our savings on that field.
- Daddy?
- Just a minute, Karin.
So what are you saying?
We can't keep the field?
Makes it real hard to keep the farm.
- Daddy.
- In a minute, Karin!
There's a man out there on your lawn.
I'll put up some coffee.
Why don't you go on outside?
Sorry.
I'll get some out there.
Hi.
Ray Kinsella.
Joe Jackson.
I bet it's good to be playing again.
Getting thrown out of baseball...
...was like having part of me amputated.
I've heard that old men wake up...
...and scratch itchy legs that have been dust for over 50 years.
That was me.
I'd wake up at night...
...with the smell of the ballpark in my nose...
...with the cool of the grass on my feet...
...the thrill of the grass.
Can you pitch?
Yeah.
Not bad.
- Don't we need a catcher?
- Not if you get it near the plate.
Right.
I'm pitching to Shoeless Joe Jackson.
Nice hit.
See if you can hit my curve.
- You can hit the curve ball.
- Put one right here.
Right.
Right, you're a low-ball hitter.
Man, I did love this game.
I'd have played for food money.
It was the game, the sounds, the smells.
Did you ever hold a ball or a glove to your face?
Yeah.
I used to love traveling on the trains from town to town.
The hotels, brass spittoons in the lobbies...
...brass beds in the rooms.
It was the crowd...
...rising to their feet when the ball was hit deep.
I'd play for nothing.
It's my family.
What's with the lights?
All the stadiums have them now.
- Even Wrigley Field.
- It's harder to see the ball.
The owners found that more people can attend night games.
Owners.
Mr. Jackson, this is my wife Annie and my daughter Karin.
Ma'am.
Are you a ghost?
- She's kidding.
- That's okay.
- What do you think?
- You look real to me.
Then I guess I'm real.
Would you like to come inside?
Thanks. I don't think I can.
Can I come back again?
Yeah. I built this for you.
There are others, you know.
There were eight of us.
It would really mean a lot to them.
Yeah. Anytime. They're all welcome here.
Is this heaven?
No.
It's Iowa.
- Where's he going?
- I don't know.
We're keeping this field.
You bet your ass we are.
- You're going to lose your farm, pal.
- How can you lose something so big?
- He misplaced the house once.
- Yeah, but it turned up two days later.
Come on. Ray?
This stupid baseball field will bankrupt you.
Everybody knows it.
If you default on your loan, you'll lose everything.
If you sell now, my partners will give you a fair price.
- Thanks, Mark, but no.
- No.
What are you holding onto this place for?
- You never liked Iowa.
- That's not true.
You never liked farming. It is true.
You don't know about farming.
I know a lot about farming.
More than you think.
Well, then how could you plow under your major crop?
What's a crop?
- Come on. That is funny.
- "What's a crop?"
- Daddy, the baseball game is on.
- Excuse us.
Excuse us.
Annie, I don't believe this guy.
I'm trying to bail him out, and he leaves to watch television.
- He used to be so normal.
- Yeah.
Hoy! Hoy! Hoy!
All right!
Watch Joe's feet.
A good left fielder knows what pitch is coming.
He can tell from the bat's angle which way the ball's heading.
- Show off!
- Stick it in your ear, Gandil.
If you'd have run like that against Detroit,
I'd have won 20 games that year!
For Pete's sakes, Cicotte, that was 68 years ago. Give it up!
Hey! You guys want to play ball or what?
- Muscle-bound jerk.
- Oh, yeah? At least I got muscles.
- At most, you got muscles.
- Come on, asshole! Pitch!
Weaver, be nice.
- Sorry, kid!
- It's okay. I don't mind.
- All right, Karin.
- Hey, hey, hey!
Mom and everybody are leaving now.
Oh, well, it was...
You know. Thanks for coming.
Think about what I said.
I'm just trying to help.
I know.
Thought you were watching some game.
It's not really a game.
It's more like practice.
There are only eight of them.
They can't play a real game.
- Eight of what?
- Them.
- Who "them"?
- Them them.
- You don't see them?
- Karin, honey, what are you watching?
- The baseball men.
- Baseball men?
- Do you see the baseball men right now?
- Of course, I do.
You really don't see them?
I don't think it's very polite to try to make other people feel stupid.
Mom, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Dee, wait. You don't see these people?
It's not funny, Annie.
They couldn't see it.
This is really interesting.
Hey, Ray, look at this.
68 years since I wore this uniform, still fits me like a glove.
You must keep in pretty good shape.
Now let's see, I died in '70.
That means I haven't had a cigarette in 18 years.
- You don't smoke, do you?
- No.
Karin! Ray! Dinner!
"Ray, dinner."
- All right.
- Come on. Let's hit the showers.
See you later.
See you, guys.
"I'm melting! I'm melting!"
Come on, you knucklehead.
That is so cool.
- Ease his pain.
- What?
I'm sorry. What?
I didn't understand. What?
Ease his pain.
"Ease his pain."
What the hell does that mean?
"Ease his pain"? What pain?
All right. Whose pain?
Thanks a lot.
Thanks a lot.
Come on, honey, wash up.
We got the PTA meeting after dinner.
They're talking about banning books again.
Really subversive books like
The Wizard of Oz, The Diary of Anne Frank.
- What happened to you?
- The voice is back.
Oh, Lord! You don't have to build a football field now, do you?
He said, "Ease his pain."
- Ease whose pain?
- I asked him. He wouldn't tell me.
- Shoeless Joe's?
- I don't think so.
- One of the other players?
- I don't think so.
This is a very nonspecific voice out there, and he's starting to piss me off.
I was having a fun day today. A good day.
Want a fry?
And I say smut and filth like this has no place in our schools.
Fascist. I'd like to ease her pain.
Mrs. Kessinik, that book you're waving about is hardly smut.
It's considered by many critics to be the classic novel about the 1960s.
- It's pornography!
- No. The Supreme Court says it's not.
- And it's author, Mr. Mann...
- Is sick!
Terence Mann is a Pulitzer Prize winner.
He's widely regarded as the finest satirist of his time.
Yeah, well, I think he's a pervert!
Probably a communist, too!
What planet are these people from?
The so-called novels of Terence Mann...
...endorse promiscuity, godlessness...
...the mongrelization of the races, and disrespect to high-ranking officers...
...of the United States Army.
And that's why right-thinking school boards...
...all across the country have been banning this man's s-h-i-t...
...since 1969.
Terence Mann?
You know why he stopped writing books?
Because he masturbates.
Excuse me, madam.
Excuse me.
Terence Mann was a warm and gentle voice of reason...
...during a time of great madness.
He coined the phrase,
"Make love, not war."
While other people chanted, "Burn, baby, burn," he was talking about love...
...and peace and understanding.
I cherished every one of his books, and I dearly wish he had written more.
Maybe if you had experienced even a little bit of the '60s...
...you might feel the same way, too.
I experienced the '60s.
No, you had two '50s and moved right into the '70s.
Annie, look at this.
Your husband plowed under his corn and built a baseball field.
- Now, there's an intelligent response.
- The weirdo.
- Annie.
- Honey, it's all right. I'll be cool.
At least he is not a book-burner, you Nazi cow.
At least I'm not married to the biggest horse's ass in three counties.
All right, Beulah, do you want to step outside?
Fine!
All right, I've got a better idea.
Let's take a vote. Who's for Eva Braun?
Who wants to burn books?
Who wants to spit on the Constitution of the United States of America? Anybody?
All right.
Now, who's for the Bill of Rights?
Who thinks freedom is a pretty darn good thing?
Come on! Let's see those hands!
Who thinks we have to stand up...
...to the kind of censorship they had under Stalin?
All right. There you go.
America, I love you. I'm proud of you.
- We got to go.
- We got to go.
This is great!
I figured it out.
Was that great, or what?
- I figured it out.
- It's just like the '60s again!
- I figured it out.
- Step outside, you Nazi cow.
- I know whose pain I'm supposed to ease.
- What?
I just halted the spread of neofascism in America...
- Terence Mann.
- What about him?
- That's whose pain.
- How do you know that?
I just know.
I was right about building the field, wasn't I?
- Yes. What's his pain?
- I don't know.
- How are you supposed to ease it?
- I don't know.
Look, he's my favorite writer, too...
...but what's Terence Mann got to do with baseball?
It's incredible. By the early '70s, the guy decides people have become...
...either too extremist or too apathetic to listen.
So he stops writing books, he starts writing poetry about whales...
...and then he starts fooling around with a home computer.
Know what he does now?
He writes software for interactive children's videos.
They teach kids how to resolve their conflicts peacefully.
- God, what an amazing guy.
- What's that got to do with baseball?
In the April 1962 issue of Jet magazine...
...there's a story called
"This Is Not A Kite."
It's not his best work, but the story's hero is named John Kinsella.
- My father.
- Wow.
What do you mean, "Wow"?
What should I say? Big wow!
What's it got to do with baseball?
You drive.
Okay, the last interview he ever gave was in 1973.
- Guess what it's about.
- Some kind of team sport.
The guy was a baseball fanatic.
Listen to this:
"As a child, my earliest recurring dream was to play at Ebbets Field...
"...with Jackie Robinson and the Brooklyn Dodgers.
"Of course, it never happened.
The Dodgers left Brooklyn.
"They tore down Ebbets Field, but even now, I still dream that dream."
That's sad.
The man wrote the best books of his generation.
He was a pioneer in the civil rights and the antiwar movement.
He made the cover of Newsweek.
He knew everybody. He did everything.
He helped shape his time.
The guy hung out with The Beatles.
It wasn't enough.
What he missed was baseball.
- Oh, my God!
- What?
As a small boy, he had a bat named Rosebud.
- Give me that.
- Sorry.
The guy hasn't been to a baseball game since 1958.
So, to ease his pain, you're supposed to take him to a ball game.
Yes.
Ray, this is nuttier than building the baseball field.
No, it's not. It's pretty weird, but building the field was weirder.
Five, ten percent weirder.
I'm sorry, I'm going to have to nip this one in the bud.
We're having moderate to heavy financial difficulties here.
You can't take off for Boston while we're going broke in Iowa.
This is really new territory for us...
...but we're dealing with primal forces of nature.
When primal forces of nature tell you to do something...
...it's not prudent to quibble over details.
- Why do you have to go?
Why can't the voice send somebody else?
How about Shirley MacLaine?
Is she too busy?
What does this have to do with you?
That's what I have to find out.
We are behind on the mortgage.
That field ate up all of our savings.
We could lose this farm.
I won't even stay in motels.
I'll sleep in the car. I'll beg for food.
No. Now, this is too much.
I understand your need to prove to yourself and to the world...
...you are not turning into your father, but you have.
You believed in the magic.
It happened. Isn't that enough?
It's more than that.
I know this is totally nuts...
...but there's another reason
I'm supposed to do it.
I feel it as strongly as I've felt anything in my life. There's a reason.
What? Just tell me what it is.
Something's going to happen at the game.
There's something at Fenway Park.
I got to be there with Terence Mann to find it out.
Is Fenway the one with the big green wall in left field?
Yeah.
I dreamt last night you were at Fenway with Terence Mann.
- Was I sitting on the first base side?
- Yes.
About halfway up on the aisle?
- Yeah. Eating a hot dog.
- Eating a hot dog.
- I had the same dream.
- I'll help you pack.
Hi, I'm Ray Kinsella.
Hi. No.
Hi, I'm Ray Kinsella.
It's a great pleasure to finally get to...
Hi, I'm Ray Kinsella. I'm a big fan of yours.
Hi.
How do you do, Mr. Mann?
I have to take you to a base...
All right, stupid, put your hands up and get in the trunk.
Good.
He lives right around here.
Do you know him?
He's sort of a tall black man.
I'm a friend of his.
If he was much of a friend, he'd have given you the directions himself.
That's a good point. Thank you.
I don't know where he lives.
Get away from me.
I ain't going to tell you nothing.
Go away. You're a pest.
Two blocks down, right-hand side.
First door that doesn't have a chicken in the window is his.
No chicken.
Who the hell are you?
Sir, my name's Ray Kinsella.
- We got a learning disability here?
- If I could just have one minute, please.
I can't tell you the secret of life, and I don't have any answers for you.
I don't give interviews, and I'm no longer a public figure.
I just want to be left alone, so piss off.
Wait! Wait!
I've come 1,500 miles to see you...
...at the risk of losing my home and alienating my wife.
All I'm asking is one minute. Please.
One minute.
I understand your desire for privacy...
...and I wouldn't intrude if this weren't extremely important.
Oh, God. I don't do causes anymore.
This isn't a cause.
I don't need money or an endorsement.
Refreshing.
You once wrote, "There comes a time...
"...when all the cosmic tumblers have clicked into place...
"...and the universe opens itself up for a few seconds...
"...to show you what's possible."
- Oh, my God!
- What?
- You're from the '60s.
- Well, yeah. Actually...
Out!
Back to the '60s!
There's no place for you here in the future.
Get back while you still can!
You've changed, you know that?
Yes, I suppose I have.
How about this? Peace, love, dope.
Now get the hell out of here!
- You've really pissed me off.
- Just hold it right there.
I didn't want to do it this way.
- What the hell is that?
- It's a gun, what do you think it is?
- It's your finger.
- No, it's a gun.
- Let me see it.
- I'm not going to show you my gun.
I'm not going to hurt you.
I just need you to come with me...
What are you doing?
I'll beat you with a crowbar until you go away.
Wait! You can't do that.
There are rules here?
Oh, no. There are no rules here.
You're a pacifist!
Shit.
Thank you.
So, what? You're kidnapping me?
What's the deal here?
I was hoping I could just convince you to come with me.
So you are kidnapping me?
I have to take you to a baseball game.
You what?
Tonight's game. Red Sox, A's.
Why?
Something will happen there.
I don't know what, but we'll find out when it does.
My name's Ray Kinsella.
You used my father's name for a character in one of your stories.
John Kinsella.
You're seeing a whole team of psychiatrists, aren't you?
I don't blame you for thinking that, but no, I'm not.
I swear to God,
I'm the least crazy person I've ever known.
Why are you kidnapping me to a baseball game?
- May I?
- Oh, please. Want a cup of coffee?
No.
Want some cookies?
No.
I read an interview you gave...
...about how you always dreamed of playing at Ebbets Field...
...and how sad you felt when they tore it down.
I never said that.
You didn't?
I don't even recall thinking that.
Weird.
This whole thing is so weird.
Then why go through with it?
It's a long story.
But it's a really good story.
I'll tell you on the way.
- I'm not getting rid of you, am I?
- No.
If you come to this game with me,
I swear I'll never bother you again.
Not even a Christmas card.
So what do you do with yourself these days?
I live, I work. I learned how to cook.
I take walks and watch sunsets.
Don't you miss being involved?
I was the East Coast distributor of involved.
I ate it and drank it and breathed it.
Then they killed Martin, and Bobby...
...they elected Tricky Dick twice...
...and now people like you think
I must be miserable...
...because I'm not involved anymore.
I've got news for you.
I spent all my misery years ago.
I have no more pain left for any of you.
I gave at the office.
So what do you want?
I want them to stop looking to me for answers...
...begging me to speak again, write again, be a leader.
I want them to start thinking for themselves.
And I want my privacy.
No, I meant what do you want?
Dog and a beer.
- Two.
Okay, I understand you.
You should be entitled to as much privacy as you want.
But why stop writing?
I haven't published a word in 17 years, and still I have to endure lunatics like you.
What do you think would happen if I suddenly came out with a new book?
They'd bleed me dry.
Go the distance.
Go the distance.
What's the matter?
- You didn't see that?
- See what?
I'm sorry.
I guess you didn't have to be here.
What?
Whenever you want to go, we can go.
Fine. Let's go.
What is it you're not telling me?
I've already taken up too much of your time.
I wish I had your passion.
Misdirected though it might be, it is still a passion.
I used to feel that way about things, but...
- You got another message, didn't you?
- You'll think I'm crazy.
I already think you're crazy.
What did it say?
It said, "The man's done enough.
Leave him alone."
Moonlight Graham.
- You saw it.
- Saw what?
You saw it. New York Giants, 1922.
He played one game. He never got to bat.
- You saw it!
- What did I see?
Chisholm, Minnesota.
We were the only ones who saw it.
Did you hear the voice, too?
It's all right to admit it.
It's what told me to find you.
Did you hear it?
"Go the distance"?
- Yes. Do you know what it means?
- Yes.
What?
It means we're going to Minnesota to find Moonlight Graham.
- We're going... We?
- I must be out of my mind.
- What do we do when we find him?
- How the hell am I supposed to know?
That's right. You're right.
- This is so bitchin'.
- I don't believe I'm doing this.
Hey, Annie, guess what?
I'm with Terence Mann.
Oh, my God. You kidnapped him.
No, I didn't. He wanted to.
I'm really sorry,
but I'm going to be a few days longer.
We're going to Minnesota.
I don't believe this. What's in Minnesota?
An old ballplayer.
I'll explain when I get home.
- How are things with you?
- Fine.
Great. Look, Ann, I got to go, okay?
Give Karin a hug for me, and I love you.
I love you, too.
Someday explain all this to me, okay?
I'll try. Bye-bye.
'Bye.
Why didn't you tell him?
You got no choice in the matter.
Half a dozen Grahams.
No Archibald. No Moonlight.
Follow me.
Hello.
Excuse me. Maybe you can help us.
We're looking for an ex-baseball player,
Archibald Graham.
- Oh, you mean Doc Graham.
- No, I think his nickname was "Moonlight."
- That's Dr. Graham.
- Dr. Graham?
His baseball career never amounted to much, so he went back to school.
His father was a doctor.
- Do you know where we can find him?
- It's nothing bad. We're not from the IRS.
Doc Graham is dead. He died in 1972.
"At times children could not afford eyeglasses or milk or clothing.
"Yet no child was ever denied these essentials...
"...because, in the background, there was always Dr. Graham.
"Without any fanfare or publicity, the glasses or the milk...
"...or the ticket to the ball game found their way into the child's pocket."
- You wrote that.
- The day he died.
Can I see that?
- You're a good writer.
- So are you.
Something's missing.
He sounds like he was a wonderful man.
Half the towns in North America have a Doc Graham.
Why do we have to travel halfway across the country to find this one...
...sixteen years after he died?
There's got to be more.
What else?
He always wore an overcoat...
...he had white hair, and he always carried an umbrella.
What was the umbrella for?
I think it got to be a habit, something to hang on to.
If you asked him, he said he used it to beat away his lady admirers.
Tell me about his wife.
Alicia.
She moved to South Carolina after Doc passed.
She passed a couple years later.
She always wore blue.
The shopkeepers in town would stock blue hats...
...because they knew if Doc walked by, he'd buy one.
When they cleaned out his office...
...they found boxes of blue hats...
...that he never got around to give her.
I'll bet you didn't know that.
No, I didn't.
No screwing, no drinking, no opium, no midnight abortions.
No illegitimate children, no shady finances.
You sound disappointed.
Shoeless Joe had a problem.
That's why he needed you.
This guy doesn't need us.
Do you know you're missing?
Oh, God.
"His father, who lives in Baltimore, notified police after receiving...
"...no answer to repeated telephone calls."
Shoot.
I better call him.
- You want me to...
- Thanks.
I'm taking a walk. Be back in a while.
What do I tell him?
"This year's"?
Dr. Graham?
Dr. Graham?
My name's Ray Kinsella. I'm from Iowa.
Are you Moonlight Graham?
No one's called me Moonlight Graham in 50 years.
I've come a very long way to see you.
I couldn't sleep tonight.
Usually I sleep like a baby.
I told Alicia I was going to take a walk.
Do you mind if I join you?
I'd like to talk to you.
Let's walk over to my office.
What do you want to talk to me about?
When you got to the majors, you played only one inning of one game.
What happened with you?
It was the last day of the season.
Bottom of the eighth inning, we were way ahead.
I'd been up with the club for three weeks, but I hadn't seen any action.
Suddenly old John McGraw points a bony finger in my direction...
...and he says, "Right field."
I jumped up like I was sitting on a spring.
Grabbed my glove, and ran out on the field.
Did you get to make a play?
They never hit the ball out of the infield.
The game ended. The season was over.
I knew they'd send me back down.
I couldn't bear the thought of another year in the minors.
So I decided to hang them up.
- Go on. Sit down.
- Thank you.
So what was that like?
It was like coming this close to your dreams...
...and then watching them brush past you, like a stranger in a crowd.
At the time, you don't think much of it.
We don't recognize our most significant moments while they're happening.
Back then I thought,
"Well, there'll be other days."
I didn't realize that was the only day.
And now, I want to ask you a question.
What's so interesting about half an inning that would make you come from Iowa...
...to talk to me about it
50 years after it happened.
I didn't really know till just now...
...but I think it's to ask you, if you could do anything you wanted...
...if you could have a wish...
And you're the kind of man who could grant me that wish?
I don't know. I'm just asking.
You know,
I never got to bat in the major leagues.
I'd have liked to have had that chance, just once...
...to stare down a big-league pitcher.
Stare him down, then just as he goes into his windup, wink.
Make him think you know something he doesn't.
That's what I wish for.
The chance to squint at a sky so blue that it hurts your eyes to look at it.
To feel the tingle in your arms as you connect with the ball.
To run the bases, stretch a double into a triple...
...and flop face first into third.
Wrap your arms around the bag.
That's my wish.
Is there enough magic out there in the moonlight...
...to make this dream come true?
- What would you say if I said yes?
- I think I'd actually believe you.
There's a place where things like that happen...
...and if you want to go, I can take you.
This is my most special place in all the world.
Once a place touches you like this, the wind never blows so cold again.
You feel for it. Like it was your child.
I can't leave Chisholm.
I understand. I do.
But I really think you're supposed to come with us.
No.
But your wish?
It'll have to stay a wish.
I was born here, I lived here,
I'll die here, but no regrets.
Fifty years ago, for five minutes, you came this close.
It would kill some men to get that close to their dream and not touch it.
They'd consider it a tragedy.
Son, if I'd only gotten to be a doctor for five minutes...
...now that would have been a tragedy.
I better be getting home.
Alicia will think I got a girlfriend.
And he smiled.
And then I figured, maybe we're not supposed to take him with us.
I don't know.
I don't know why in the hell we were supposed to come here.
Maybe it's to find out if one inning can change the world.
- Think it did?
- It did for these people.
If he'd gotten a hit, he might have stayed in baseball.
I don't know.
Your wife called before.
She wants you to call her tonight.
I'm fine. I'm just so glad it's you.
Listen, I talked to the bank...
...and I asked them if we could miss a payment or two...
...and they told me that they had just sold the note on the farm...
...to Mark and his partners.
Right. So they own the paper now.
He says if we don't sell to them, they're going to foreclose.
We don't have the money.
Look, I've got to take Mr. Mann back to Boston first.
- No.
- Wait a second.
I'm going to Iowa with you.
We're coming home.
Hell, I can't quit now.
I got to see this ball park.
Not everyone can see it. You might not.
Give it a try.
I need all the karma I can get right now.
- Thanks. You're the first car by.
- How far you going?
- How far you going?
- Iowa.
If it's okay, I'll just ride along a while.
I play baseball.
- Hop in.
- All right.
I'm looking for a place to play.
I heard that all through the Midwest, they have towns with teams.
And in some places, they'll even find you a day job...
...so you can play ball nights and weekends.
This is your lucky day, kid.
We're going someplace kind of like that.
All right.
- I'm Ray Kinsella. This is Terence Mann.
- Hi.
I'm Archie Graham.
It's funny the way he described towns finding you a job...
...so that you could play on their team.
They haven't done that for years.
My dad did that for a while, but that was in the '20s.
What happened to your father?
He never made it as a ballplayer...
...so he tried to get his son to make it for him.
By the time I was 10, playing baseball...
...got to be like eating vegetables or taking out the garbage.
So when I was 14, I started to refuse.
Can you believe that?
American boy refusing to have a catch with his father?
Why 14?
That's when I read The Boat Rocker by Terence Mann.
God!
I never played catch with him again.
That's the kind of crap people always lay on me.
It's not my fault you wouldn't play catch with him.
I know.
Anyway, when I was 17...
...I packed my things, said something awful, and left.
After a while, I wanted to come home, but I didn't know how.
Made it back for the funeral, though.
What was the awful thing you said?
To your father?
I said I could never respect a man whose hero was a criminal.
Who was his hero?
Shoeless Joe Jackson.
You knew he wasn't a criminal.
Then why did you say it?
I was 17.
The son of a bitch died before I could take it back.
Before I could tell him...
...you know.
He never met my wife.
He never saw his granddaughter.
This is your penance.
I know. I can't bring my father back.
So the least you can do is bring back his hero.
Well...
Now I know what everybody's purpose here is.
Except mine.
- Daddy!
- Karin, come here.
Hi!
- We missed you. Are you okay?
- Yeah. This is Terence Mann.
Terry.
- Welcome.
- Thank you.
Hi, Terry.
And this young fellow is...
This is Archie Graham.
- Archie.
- He's come to practice with the team.
Yeah? He's going to be able to do a lot more than that.
What does that mean?
- Welcome back.
- Thanks, Joe.
- Oh, my God.
- What?
That's Shoeless Joe Jackson!
Of course it is.
You mean you didn't believe me?
I thought I did, but... Oh, my God.
- Hi, Annie.
- Hi, Joe.
Good to see you. Terry,
I'd like you to meet Shoeless Joe Jackson.
Joe, Terry Mann.
- It's a pleasure meeting you.
- The pleasure's mine.
I hope you don't mind, but we got tired of just having practices...
...so we brought another team out so we could have some real games.
I don't mind. Where'd they come from?
Where did we come from?
You wouldn't believe how many guys wanted to play.
We had to beat 'em off with a stick.
That's "Smokey" Joe Wood, and Mel Ott...
...and Gil Hodges!
Ty Cobb wanted to play.
We couldn't stand the son of a bitch when we were alive...
...so we told him to stick it!
- Are you Graham?
- Yes, sir.
What are you doing on the sidelines?
You came to play ball, didn't you?
Yes, sir.
- All right. Well, go warm up.
- Yes, sir.
Rookies.
Unbelievable.
It's more than that.
It's perfect.
Safe!
Go, Graham! Go, kid!
Come on, Archie!
He looks like a baby next to those guys.
He is.
Let's go.
Watch it, boy!
Don't let him shake you up. Hang in there!
Knuckles, what did you throw at the kid for?
- He winked at me.
- Don't wink, kid.
Good thing for you he didn't throw the fastball.
Let's see that fastball.
Ball.
Hey! Come on. Give us a break!
Hey, ump.
- How about a warning?
- Sure. Watch out you don't get killed.
Time!
Time!
Those first two were high and tight.
So what do you think the next one will be?
Either low and away or in my ear.
He's not going to want to load the bases.
So look for low and away.
Right.
But watch out for in your ear.
- Come on, Archie!
- Let's go, kid!
Batter, batter, batter!
Come on, Arch. It just takes one.
- Yeah.
- That's deep enough.
Go! Go! Go home!
- Safe!
- Son of a...
Way to go, Arch! Way to go!
Attaboy, Arch!
This is the wave!
- Way to go, man!
- Yeah, Archie.
- All right.
- Archie, we need it.
- Way to go.
- Yeah. Way to go.
- What is this?
- What is this jerk doing?
Hi!
- Shit! Wreck him.
- Let me at him!
You're interrupting the game, Mark.
It's time to put away your little fantasies and come down to Earth.
- It's not a fantasy. They're real.
- Who is real?
Shoeless Joe Jackson, the White Sox, all of them.
- You mean?
- No. He can't see any of them.
Who is this, Elvis?
Ray.
As a matter of fact, it's Terence Mann.
How do you do? I'm the Easter Bunny.
- Let's settle this thing now.
- Look. I'm not selling.
You have no money.
You have a stack of bills!
Come fall, you got no crop to sell.
But, I have a deal that allows you to stay on the land.
Daddy? We don't have to sell the farm.
- You'll live in the house rent-free.
- What about the team...
Do you realize how much this land is worth?
Yeah. Yeah.
$2,200 an acre.
We can't keep a useless baseball diamond in rich farmland.
Read my lips. We're staying, all right?
- We're staying.
- Ray, you're bankrupt!
I'm offering you a way to keep your home because I love my sister.
My partners don't care and are ready to foreclose right now.
Daddy, we don't have to sell the farm.
- Karin, please!
- Just wait! Wait!
People will come.
- What people, sweetheart?
- From all over.
They'll just decide to take a vacation, see?
And they'll come to Iowa City.
They'll think it's really boring.
So they'll want to pay us.
Like buying a ticket.
You're not seriously listening to this, are you?
- Yes.
- Wait a minute.
Why would anybody pay money to come here?
To watch the games.
It will be just like when they were kids, a long time ago.
They'll watch the game and remember what it was like.
- What the hell is she talking about?
- People will come.
All right. This is fascinating...
...but you don't have the money to bring the mortgage up to date.
So, you're still going to have to sell.
I'm sorry, Ray. We got no choice.
People will come, Ray.
They'll come to Iowa for reasons they can't even fathom.
They'll turn up your driveway, not knowing for sure why they're doing it.
They'll arrive at your door as innocent as children...
...longing for the past.
"Of course, we won't mind if you look around," you'll say.
"It's only $20 per person."
They'll pass over the money without even thinking about it.
For it is money they have and peace they like.
Ray! Just sign the papers.
Then they'll walk off to the bleachers...
...and sit in their shirtsleeves on a perfect afternoon.
They'll find they have reserved seats somewhere along one of the baselines...
...where they sat when they were children and cheered their heroes...
...and they'll watch the game...
...and it will be as if they dipped themselves in magic waters.
The memories will be so thick...
...they'll have to brush them away from their faces.
When the bank opens in the morning, they'll foreclose.
People will come, Ray.
You're broke, Ray.
You sell now, or you lose everything.
The one constant through all the years,
Ray, has been baseball.
America has rolled by like an army of steamrollers.
It's been erased like a blackboard, rebuilt, and erased again.
But baseball has marked the time.
This field, this game.
It's a part of our past, Ray.
It reminds us of all that once was good...
...and it could be again.
People will come, Ray.
People will most definitely come.
Ray, you will lose everything.
You will be evicted.
Come on, Ray.
I'm not signing.
You're crazy! Absolutely nuts!
I can't do it, pal.
Ray, you build a baseball field in the middle of nowhere...
...and you stare at nothing.
It's not nothing.
- Your daughter's turned into a space case.
- Get your hands off her!
Karin?
- Is she all right?
- I don't know.
- Is she breathing?
- Should I get the car?
I'm going to call emergency.
- Annie, wait.
- What?
Just wait.
- What have we got here?
- She fell.
- This child's choking to death.
- Get her up.
Hold her steady now.
Hot dog. Stuck in her throat.
She'll be all right.
She'll be turning handsprings before you know it.
Thank you, Doc.
No, son. Thank you.
Oh, my God. You can't go back.
- You can't go back.
- It's all right.
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
I best be getting on home...
...before Alicia begins to think
I got a girlfriend.
Hey, Doc.
Good work, Doc.
Nice going, Doc.
Going to miss you.
Win one for me one day, will you, boys?
- Okay, Doc.
- Yeah.
When did these ballplayers get here?
Hey, rookie!
You were good.
Do not sell this farm, Ray.
You got to keep this farm.
You've had a rough day.
- Go inside and get something cold to drink.
- Yeah.
That's a good idea.
Don't sell the farm, Ray.
Ray?
We're going to call it a day.
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.
Do you want to come with us?
- You mean it?
- No, not you.
Him.
- Him?
- Come with you?
- Out there.
- What is out there?
Come and find out.
Wait a second. Why him? I built this field.
- You wouldn't be here if it weren't for me.
- I'm unattached. You have a family.
I want to know what's out there.
- I want to see it.
- But you're not invited.
"Not invited"?
What do you mean I'm not invited?
That's my corn out there.
You guys are guests in my corn.
I've done everything I've been asked to do.
I didn't understand, but I've done it.
I haven't once asked what's in it for me.
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying, "What's in it for me?"
Is that why you did this? For you?
I think you'd better stay here, Ray.
Why?
Ray. There's a reason they chose me...
...just as there's a reason they chose you and this field.
I gave an interview.
What are you talking about?
The one about Ebbets Field, the one that sent you to Boston to find me.
- You lied to me.
- You were kidnapping me at the time.
- You lied to me!
- You said your finger was a gun.
- That's a good point.
- Ray.
Listen to me, Ray. Listen to me.
There is something out there...
...and if I have the courage to go through with this...
...what a story it'll make.
"Shoeless Joe Jackson comes to Iowa."
- Are you going to write about it?
- You bet I'll write about it.
- You're going to write about it.
- That's what I do.
Good.
Good.
Honey, where's he going?
Terry's been invited to go out with the other players.
- How are you feeling, sweetheart?
- Stupid.
You mean "out"?
Yeah.
Out.
Far out.
I want a full description.
Take care of this family.
Be careful.
'Bye.
What?
What are you grinning at, you ghost?
"If you build it...
"...he will come."
- Oh, my God.
- What? What is it?
It's my father.
"Ease his pain."
"Go the distance."
It was you.
No, Ray. It was you.
My God.
I only saw him years later when he was worn down by life.
Look at him.
He's got his whole life in front of him, and I'm not even a glint in his eye.
What do I say to him?
Why don't you introduce him to his granddaughter?
Hi.
Hi.
I just wanted to thank you folks for putting up this field...
...letting us play here.
I'm John Kinsella.
I'm Ray.
My wife Annie.
This is my daughter Karin.
Karin, this is my...
This is John.
Hi, John.
Hi, Karin.
Well, we're going to let you two talk.
If all these people are going to come, we got a lot of work to do.
It was very nice meeting you.
Ma'am.
Come on.
You catch a good game.
Thank you.
It's so beautiful here.
For me...
For me, it's like a dream come true.
Can I ask you something?
Is this heaven?
It's Iowa.
- Iowa?
- Yeah.
I could have sworn it was heaven.
Is there a heaven?
Oh, yeah.
It's the place where dreams come true.
Maybe this is heaven.
Good night, Ray.
Good night, John.
Hey! Dad?
You want to have a catch?
I'd like that.

- Where are we ?
- I don't know.
- Well, look at the map.
- It's not on the map.
- Is he coming after us ?
- I think we gave him the slip.
[ All Screaming ]
It's him !
Run for it !
- Which way ?
- This way. Careful.
[ All Shouting ]
[ Nervous Chuckle ]
We can explain everything, sir.
It's not as bad as it looks.
We just borrowed the map.
Sort of got rather happy about it, and, uh... ran off in high spirits.
Yeah, we did.
Who are you ?
That's not him.
It didn't sound like him, did it ?
It doesn't even look like him.
- It isn't him.
- Let's get him !
[ All Shouting ]
Strutter, get his torch.
Shine it right in the face.
His face, dummy !
[ Strutter ]
It's a kid !
Og, Fidgit, check the door.
All clear.
Strutter, the light.
Just tell us how we get out of here, keep quiet and you won't get hurt.
Wh-Why don't you get out the way you came ?
Don't try and be smart with me, you little creep.
Yeah.
If you want to play it smart,
I'll introduce you to Vermin.
He eats anything, you know.
I'm not trying to be smart.
I'm just trying to help.
- You know, don't you ?
- I don't know anything.
You know, and you're not going to tell us.
- I'm getting angry, and Vermin's getting hungry.
- I don't know !
- He's found it !
- What ?
- The way out.
- It's never done that before.
Come on, you lot, push !
[ Men Grunting ]
Oh, no !
Not like that !
Wait for me to give the order, all right ?
Ready ? One--
[ Men Grunting ]
Stop ! Stop !
You never start on one.
Who ever heard of anybody starting anything on one ?
- What is it then, two or three ?
- Three.
- [ Men Grunting ]
- And push !

- He's found us !
Help us ! Please !

Where are we ?
What happened to my bedroom ?
Who was that man ?
That was no man.
That was the Supreme Being.
You mean God ?
We don't know him that well.
We only work for Him.
Shut up !
Now, are we all here ?
- What ?
- Og, are you here ?
- Yeah, he's here.
- Vermin ?
[ Chickens Clucking ]
Vermin, will you stop eating !
It's too dangerous to stay here.
He's probably still after us.
So we better keep moving.
Hey, where are you going ?
- Hey, where are you going ?
- Get him ! He'll give us away.

Sorry.
What town is that ?
Castiglione, or what
Napoleon's left of it.
- Napoleon ?
- Yes. It's his city now.
Come on, boy.
You come with us.
No, thanks.
Come with us if you know what's good for you.
You're going the wrong way.
Napoleon ?
- Get down !
- You nearly got us caught !
You silly fool.
You could've ruined everything.
- Do you know where we are ?
- Shut up. Of course I do.
Battle of Castiglione.
See ?
Are you sure we're not in somebody's bedroom ?
Look, do you want to be leader of this gang ?
- We agreed no leader.
- Right. So shut up and do as I say.
Now, we've got to get into the city.
We can't.
The roads are too dangerous.
I've got an idea.
We can use the river.
Come on !
[ Explosion ]
[ Man Shouting ]
Aaaah !

What are we going to do here ?

Monsieur Commander...
I think that the mayor of
Castiglione and his council... would like very much to surrender now, please.
Look at that !
Look at the little fellow !
[ Napoleon Laughing ]
With the city, we have the whole area of western Lombardy at our feet.
Oh, go away !
I never should've married you !
- [ Whimpering ]
- Oh, stop it !
[ Laughing ]
Yes ! Yes !
Mon Commander, they are very keen to surrender.
They have been here eight hours.
Don't stand so close to me, Neguy !
I've told you about that before.
You on one side and him on the other--
It's like being on the bottom of a bloody well !
Just because you think I'm small.
No, Commander, you are not small at all.
No, not by any means.
Five-foot-one is not small.
Yeah, five-foot-one and conqueror of ltaly.
- Not bad, huh ?
- Very, very good.

You, Lucien, the rest of you.
Great streaks of misery.
- But sir--
- No !
I'm going to have some new generals for a bit.
[ Napoleon ]
Alexander the Great... five feet exactly.
Isn't that incredible ?
Alexander the Great, whose empire stretched from lndia to Hungary--
One inch shorter than me.
[ Laughs ]
[ Polite Laughter ]
[ Clock Chimes ]
Oliver Cromwell... the only man with any guts in British history--
Not a big man at all.
[ Dog Barking ]
Louis IV, 5' 21/2".
[ Laughing ]
Charlemagne... a dumpy little five-footer.
- [ Snoring ]
- Squatty little chap.
Attila the Hun, 5' 11/2".
Cyrano de Bergerac,
Tamburlaine the Great, four-foot-nine... and three quarters.
[ Drops Glass ]
Wasn't he interesting ?
Strutter, wake up.
Wake up.
According to this map, there's a time hole outside. See if you can find it.
- Right.
- The rest of you, the hole disappears at 12:00, right ?
So let's get moving.
Vermin, Fidgit, the tapestry.
Hey, that's 16th century !

Okay.

Oh, Sir Vincent, you came for me !
Oh, Good Mistress Pansy,
I could not have ridden faster.
Four horses have I exhausted this day from Nottingham.
Oh, the way you leapt to my chamber, so full of... manliness.
I could scarce restrain the rushing of my feet.
These 12 long years have been like chains that bound me.
Oh. And the personal problem ?
- Much, much better.
- Ohhh.
And now we will ride full tilt to Dover, and there embark for France.
Oh, you don't have to wear the special--
No, no, I don't have to wear the special-- anymore.
Oh, Pansy.
No more worries now, Pansy.

Why, it's obvious.
We're, um--
[ Pansy ] Vincent, don't worry about a thing.
[ Vincent ]
I'm not worrying.
- Exactly--
- In the Middle Ages.
Hmm... in the Middle Ages.
Five-hundred years before the man we just robbed was even born.
- Fantastic !
- Try that one in a court of law.
Vermin, that is not meant to be eaten.
You never know until you've eaten it.
Is it always like this when you've done a raid ?
I don't know.
We've never done one before.
But I thought you were international criminals.
Going to be.
Going to be.
Yeah, going to be.
Aren't we ? Going to be ?
Especially now that we've got you, Kevin.
Hang on. He's just a kid.
He's not one of us.
He knows an awful lot.
Yeah, and he's bigger than any of us.
- Do you really want to join us ?
- Can we really go anywhere ?
You name it.
If it's down here.
[ Laughing, Cheering ]
I don't understand.
What's so special about that map ?
This map used to belong to the Supreme Being.
- You stole it ?
- No. Well, sort of.
He used to be our employer.
He made all the big stuff,
Iike good and evil, men and women, night and day.
And when He did trees and shrubs, we helped make all this.
Whew, that's not bad.
Yeah, and did we get a thimble full of credit for it ?
No, all we got was the sack, just for creating the Pink Bunkadoo.
- Pink Bunkadoo ?
- Yeah. Beautiful tree that was.
- Og designed it, didn't you ? Yeah.
- [ Muttering ]
Six-hundred feet high, bright red and smelled terrible.
As a disciplinary measure, we were sent down to the repairs department.
- [ Chattering Continues ]
- What ?
You see, to be quite frank, the fabric of the universe is far from perfect.
It was a bit of a botched job.
We only had seven days to make it.
And that's where this comes in.
This is the only map of all the holes.
Well, why repair them ?
Why not use them to get stinkin' rich ?
Yeah, stinkin' rich !

Jolly good.
And you're a robber, are you ?
Jolly good.
And do you enjoy robbing, then ?
Well, it helps pay the rent, sir.

Jolly good.
And you're a robber too ?
How long have you been a robber ?
- Four-foot-one.
- Good Lord !
- Jolly good. Four-foot-one ?
- Yes.
Well, th-th-th-that is a long time, isn't it ?
Well now, I hear you've made a pretty good haul.
Well, see for yourself, sir.
Gosh ! I say !
Crikey ! I mean,
I've been in robbing for years, but I've never seen anything like this.

Well, it was a good day,
Mr. Hood.
- Jolly good day !
- It's nice, isn't it ?
Rather ! Well, I mean, what can I say ? Thank you.
Thank you all very, very much indeed.
Oh, don't ment-- What ?
Well, I mean, it's frightfully kind of you.
The poor are going to be absolutely thrilled.
- Have you met them ?
- Who ? The poor ?
Oh, you must meet them.
I just know you'll like them.
Of course, they haven't got two pennies to rub together.
- But that's because they're poor.
- [ All Laughing ]
Uh, Marion, would you be so kind as to ask the poor to come in, please ?
- No problem.
- Thank you so much.
- Right. Come on, you lot.
- Let's just see what we've got.
This is going to be so much help in our work.
No, you don't understand.
All this stuff is ours. We stole it.
Oh, yes, I know, and believe you me the poor are going to be not just thrilled, but also considerably less poor, aren't they, Redgrave ?
- [ Gibberish ]

- He said, "Yeah, what with

- Congratulations. Jolly good.

- Any chance of a rescue ?
- Stop moaning !
He's obviously a dangerous man.
Unbalanced, if you ask me.
Giving away what isn't even his !
That's what Robin Hood always did. Even I know that.
- Oh, of course. You know it all.
- He was one of my heroes.
Heroes ! Heroes !
What do they know about a day's work ?
- Leave him alone, Randall !
- Well, it makes me sick.
Anyone who's always right makes me sick.
- That's why you get on with yourself !
- Watch it !

So... these are the sort of people... the Supreme Being allows to steal His map ?
Look at them.
Stunted little proles.
I wouldn't entrust them to wipe their own noses.
Oh, no, sir. It's much too difficult for them.
What sort of supreme being created such riffraff ?
Is it not the workings of a complete incompetent ?
But He created you,
Evil One.
What did you say ?
Well, He created you, so He can't be totally--
Never talk to me like that again !
No one created me !
I am Evil !
Evil existed long before good.
I made myself.
I cannot be unmade.
I am all-powerful !
Yeah.
But why, if that's the case, are you unable to escape from this fortress ?
That's a good question.
Why have I let the Supreme Being keep me here... in the Fortress of Ultimate Darkness ?
- Because you--
- Oh, shut up.
I'm speaking rhetorically.
- Of course.
- I let Him keep me here... in order to lull Him into a false sense of security.
Ah, clever, clever.
When I have the map,
I will be free... and the world will be different because I have understanding.
- Uh, understanding of what, master ?
- Of digital watches.
Soon I shall have understanding of video cassette recorders and car telephones.
And when I have understanding of them,
I shall have understanding of computers.
And when I have understanding of computers, I shall be the Supreme Being.
God isn't interested in technology.
He knows nothing of the potential of the micro-chip or the silicon revolution.
Look how He spends His time.
Forty-three species of parrots !
- Nipples for men !
- Slugs.
Slugs ! He created slugs.
They can't hear. They can't speak.
They can't operate machinery.
Are we not in the hands of a lunatic ?
Sir... Iook !
If I were creating a world,
I wouldn't mess about with butterflies and daffodils.
I would have started with lasers, 8:00 day one.

- Sorry.
I just can't wait for a new tech-- techno-- technological dawn.
Sir... Iook !
What is it, Benson ?
The map, sir. The map !
They've brought it with them !
- What ?
- I saw the map, master, just now.
- Are you sure ?
- I'm sure, master.
Down there !
The little one has it.
The little one ?
This is our chance.
This is what we've been waiting for !
- It will set us free.
- Shut up !
If you're wrong, Benson, my revenge will be slow and unpleasant.
I will turn you inside out over a very long period of time.
Oh, thank you, master.
Thank you.
Now we must bait the hook, see if they bite... and pull them in.
Stand by for mind control.
What about Babylon ?
- Who ?
- It's a city of legendary wealth.
Ahh.

There is a place where we could find the greatest thing man could want, the goal of everybody's hopes and dreams.
What the hell are you talking about ?
The most fabulous object in the world.
- That sounds like a good idea.
- Yeah.
They're hooked, the greedy little fish.
- [ Kevin ] Why do you always have to go after money ?
- Who's this ?
I don't know, master.
I haven't seen him before.
He's stronger than the rest.
Who is he ?
- I don't know.
- I'm losing them.
Something's going on down there.
We've lost them !

Look, closer.

- That's a hole ?
- Exactly !
- It could lead almost anywhere.
- Everywhere !
- What ?
- We just found the biggest hole in the universe, and it's practically below our feet !

- Come on, you lot ! Shift !
- We'll never get out of here !
Wanna bet ?
No !
That's right, Og. Show 'em we can do something right for a change.
That's it.

Give us some more.
That's enough, Wally !

- But Evil's got the map, Randall !
- Oh, damn right, yes.
Last thing we want to do is see him again. Come on.
But you can't leave it with him, or he'll destroy the world !
Oh, Robert, Benson,
I feel the power of evil coursing through my veins, filling every corner of my being with the desire to do wrong.
- I feel so bad, Benson.
- Good ! Good !
Yes, it is good, for this is the worst kind of badness that I'm feeling.
- Kill me, master ! Kill me !
- Not now, Benson. We have work to do.
No less a work than the overthrowing of creation itself.
We will remake man in our image, not His.
We will turn mountains into sea, and the skies into rivers, and fjords into deserts.
- Come on ! Come on !
- And deserts into quagmires.
The boy's insane.
We can't go in there.
Shh !
Oh !
- Let me see !
- And icebergs into fire !
And the fire into a mighty rushing wind which will cover the face of the earth... and wipe clean the scourge of woolly thinking once and for all.
We can make beans into peas !
Oh, Benson.
Dear Benson, you are so mercifully free of the ravages of intelligence.
- You say... such nice things, master.
- Yes, I know. I'm sorry.
Now, Benson, I shall have to turn you into a dog for a while.
Thank you, master.
[ Grunting ]
Stay, Benson.
Guard the map.
Robert, we must plan a new world together.
This time we'll start it properly.
Tell me about computers.
Uh, a computer is an automatic electronic apparatus... for making calculations.
[ Robert ]
Or controlling operations...
- [ Creaking ]
- that are expressible... in numerical or logical terms.
[ Evil ]
And fast breeder reactors ?
[ Robert ]
Ah, fast breeder reactors... use a fast fission process... for the generation of fissile isotopes.

Half oyster ?
Half carrot ?
- Or the diseased left tonsil--

- Don't, don't be so stupid.
- Call them off !
Very well.
I have no need of them.

- Yes, master ?

Oh, wonderful, master ! Wonderful !
- Wonderful !
- Don't mention it.

Oh, do hurry up.
- Oh, yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
I'd like to explain everything.
We didn't mean to steal the map.
We didn't mean to run away--
What do you mean, you didn't mean to steal the map ?
- It, it just sort of--
- Of course you didn't mean to steal it.
I gave it to you.
You silly man. And that.
- Do you really think I didn't know ?
- Sir ?
I had to have some way of testing my handiwork.
I think it turned out rather well.
- Don't you ?
- Hmm ?
Evil turned out rather well.
Mm-hmm.
Whose are these ?
Mine, sir.
They're mine, sir.
You really are an untidy boy.
Sign... here.
Do you mean you knew what was happening to us all the time ?
Well, of course.
I am the Supreme Being.
- I'm not entirely dim.
- Oh, no, sir.
We're not suggesting that, sir.
It's just--
That I let you borrow my map.
Now I want every bit of Evil... placed in here.
- Right away.
- Of course, sir.
Come on.
You mean you let all those people die, just to test your creation ?
Yes.
You really are a clever boy.
Why did they have to die ?
You might as well say,
"Why do we have to have evil ?"
Oh, we wouldn't dream of asking a question like that, sir.
Yes. Why do we have to have evil ?
Ah.
- I think it's something to do with freewill.
- [ Dwarves Grunting ]
Do be careful.
You weren't watching.
Don't lose any of that stuff.
That's concentrated evil.
One drop of that could turn you all into hermit crabs.
I'm sorry, sir.
I, I was just wondering if there's, um, any chance we might have our old jobs back, sir.
- Oh, you certainly were appallingly bad robbers.
- Yes, sir.
I really should do something very extrovert and vengeful with you.
Honestly, I'm too tired.
But I think I'll just transfer you to the undergrowth department-- yes, bracken, small shrubs-- that sort of thing-- with a 19%%% cut in salary backdated to the beginning of time.
- Thank you, sir.
- Oh, thank you, sir.
Well, I am the nice one.
Is it all ready ? Right !
Come on, then.
Back to creation.
- I mustn't waste any more time.
- Bye, Kevin.
They'll think I've lost control again and put it all down to evolution.
- Come on.
- Sir ?
- Yes ?
- What about my friend, sir ?
Can he come with us ?
No, of course not.
This isn't a school outing.
But, sir, he deserves something.
- I mean, without him--
- Oh, don't go on about it.
- He's got to stay here to carry on the fight.

Excuse me, sir, it's a beautiful day.
Would...
No, thanks.

Would you care to make a contribution to The Lighthouse?
I'm Paul.
I'm Irena.
Yes, I know.
Welcome home.
Thank you.
How was your flight?
Oh, I hate flying.
It scares me to death.
It scares me, too.
You look really nice.
Thank you.
Welcome to New Orleans.
Well, I wanted to get here as fast as I could.
WOMAN OVER MICROPHONE:
Mr. Al Curtis, please pick up the white courtesy phone.
We can get a taxi down there.
Did you wait long?
No, no, just a few minutes.
You're here at last.
I'm so glad.
Oh, let me look at you.
Oh, your hair is so pretty.
Is that how they're doing the hair now?
Female, this is my sister Irena.
I can see that.
I'd know those
Gallier eyes anywhere.
Oh, Paul, she's a lovely, lovely little thing.
Your brother is driving me crazy waiting for you.
Do I get the credit for that?
Female keeps me out of trouble.
And that's a full time job, honey.
You better believe it.
Female. Female, like female.
F-E-M-A-L-E.
See I was orphaned, too. You, you like this house?
They didn't know what name to put on the birth certificate, so they put
"Child, female".
But the woman that raised me,
God rest her soul, she didn't read
English too good, so she pronounced it "Female".
So here I am.
Female. Female.
PAUL: Fate wrenched us apart as children.
Thy mercy restores us here today.
For this mending, thank thee,
O Lord.
Amen.
Amen.
Mmm!
Watch out.
This is hot!
I forgot to call the Robinsons.
I'm sorry.
Why do you have to call now?
They care about me.
Sit down, sit down, sit down.
You can call after dinner.
This is Female's special gumbo.
Special gumbo tonight from yesterday's chicken.
That's right.
That's right.
I just didn't want them to worry about me.
They've been really nice.
You'd like them.
Janice works at the nursery school.
At least part-time.
She has three children.
And Arnold is from the CPA, you know?
He's extremely mellow.
The only time he loses his temper is about April 15th.
Did they ever tell you how our parents died?
IRENA: Yes.
What did they tell you about me?
Not much.
I mean, I knew
I had a brother, but I was only four.
I used to fantasize about you when I was in the orphanage.
Fantasize?
Well, you know, about you coming to rescue me and things.
Daydreams.
Yes, I had the same dreams.
I've got a surprise for you.
Do you remember when we used to practice together?
Practice?
For what?
For the circus.
I said it was a surprise.
Now, no peeking, huh?
No peeking!
Ta-da.
IRENA: God!
Well, the skeletons are out of the closet now, huh?
When Grandfather started the circus, he only had one wagon.
It was a beautiful two-tiered one.
There's a picture of it somewhere.
Oh, there they are. See?
Yeah.
The apes were kept on top and the cat underneath.
The chimp used to tease the cat by throwing its garbage down through the bars.
Oh, they were so young.
Mother looks so happy.
I envy you.
I wish I'd known her.
"Some little mice
Sat in the barn to spin
"Pussy came by
And popped her head in
"'What are you doing, my little men? '
"'Weaving coats for... '
"'Weaving coats for gentlemen"'

"'Shall I come in
And cut your threads off? '
"'Oh, no, kind sir. "'Oh, no, kind sir.
"'We will snap our heads off."'
"'We will snap our heads off."'
What took you so long?
He's been waiting
45 minutes.
Fuck off! I had to get a babysitter.
Room three.
Hurry up.
Here, that's good.
I'll take that.
"Babysitter."
You're always late.
Sorry I'm late.
Hi, I'm Ruthie.
But you can call me anything you want, if the price is right.
RUTHIE: A joke.
It doesn't cost anything extra to laugh.
Oh, I get it.
The strong silent type, huh?
You know the rules around here?
I guess not. Okay.
A massage alone is $25, and for $25, that's all you get.
Tipping is allowed and appreciated.
You know, if you wanna negotiate for something extra.
Now we take Master Charge,
Visa, American Express, but not for tips.
Okay, that's not really true.
You can put tips on Visa if you want.
Ew!
My God!
Somebody help me!
Dr. Yates,
New Orleans Zoo.
Bill Searle called, said something about a stray cat?
What took you so long?
Go on inside.
It's in here?
Right there.
BILL: Oliver, you aren't gonna believe this.
What it is, see, it's a goddamn black leopard is what it is.
We don't know where it came from,
'cause we don't know.
I guess it mauled a hooker last night.
She's all right.
We've got it trapped in a room upstairs here.
Look at this.
Candid Camera.
Let's hear it for voyeurism.
Strictly security.
Sure.
Where'd he go?
Back under the bed.
Must've scared the shit out of the john who was here last night.
Guy split, stark naked.
In this neighborhood, who'd notice?
How'd it get in there, anyway?
I don't know.
Fire escape?
There's no fire escape.
And the window's got bars on 'em.
Back door?
Locked.
He must've come in the front.
I think I would have noticed.
Wait.
Look there.
Holy shit!
He's enormous.
125, 130 pounds.
OLIVER: More like 150.
He's big, all right.
Real big.
All right, let's go with the ketamine, straight,
2,000 milligrams.
Let's knock him down quick and get him in the squeeze cage.
Yeah. Okay.
Can you get to that window from the outside?
Sure.
All right, let's go.
Bill, if we could borrow a couple of walkie-talkies,
I could assist from the monitor.
Can I borrow it?
Thanks. Thanks.
OLIVER: You got a short memory, man.
I shot the coyote in
Baton Rouge, remember?
2,000 milligrams?
Yeah.
You got one ready in case I miss?
Uh-huh.
Full two
CO2 cartridge?
You got room for this?
I'll make room.
I'll hold the ladder.
OLIVER: Hold the ladder.
Be careless.
You too.
ALICE: He already knows you're there.
I hear him. He doesn't sound overjoyed.
You're scaring him.
What are you doing?
OLIVER: Cleaning the window.
What?
Cleaning the...
Jesus Christ, he's going through the goddamn window.
ALICE: Jesus.
Paul?
How is he?
He's okay.
Come on.
Good morning.
Morning. Where's Paul?
They needed him at the mission, bright and early.
He was going to show me the sights.
Get yourself a guidebook.
They sell them all over town.
Go to the French Quarter.
You'll have a good time.
And don't worry about him.
Now, sit down.
Would you like some coffee?
I want to see if you like it. Chicory.
Then I'll steam you some milk.
You want some breakfast?
No, thank you.
That's all right.
I'll fix you some breakfast, don't worry.
Yes, can I help you?
I'm looking for Paul Gallier.
I don't believe he's in today.
Oh. I'm his sister.
Oh?
Well, I can take you to his office if you'd like to wait.
No, thank you.
Thank you.
What's that over there?
That's the zoo.
Oh, wait,
I wanna go there.
What for?
Nothing but a dump.
You wanna go to a zoo?
Why don't you go to the Bronx?
Why don't you let me take you to the French Quarter?
I've seen the French Quarter.
Now, please stop!
It's your money.
Keep the change.
WOMAN: All right, children, stay in line.
MAN: He's not so dangerous in a cage.
OLIVER: When we get finished testing, we're gonna have to free up some of these other exhibits so that we can give this new leopard some extra space.
You're gonna have to disarm him.
What does that involve?
Not much.
Cut its claws, root canals.
File and crown its fangs.
There's a dentist in town that does the work.
Radenauer.
Tom Radenauer?
Yeah, he does people, too.
JUDSON: Yeah, I know, he's my dentist.
Shit, Oliver, we don't have the funds for this.
And you know how it's been coming down lately.
Aren't there any other alternatives?
OLIVER: Not really.
Because of its history it's no good for breeding.
We could try trading it to another zoo.
I'm afraid with its erratic behavior, they just wouldn't take it.
BILL: You could euthanize it.
JUDSON: What's that? Kill it?
Yep.
Not an acceptable solution.
How much would that cost?
I said, it's not acceptable!
Can we at least discuss it?
I'll put up with being under-budgeted and under-staffed, and the fact that these exhibits were built in
1901, and they're falling apart, but I will not put up with that crap!
Fine!
Calm down.
I only asked!
ALICE: Looks like we have a gourmet leopard on our hands.
He threw up in the cage.
Joe found pizza in the vomit...
JOE: Yeah. Sure did.
Pepperoni.
Leopards eat pizza?
Well, they're scavengers.
He probably raided a garbage can before he went to the massage parlor.
Doesn't look like he went there out of hunger.
Maybe he was horny.
OLIVER: Always a possibility.
Anything else?
Nothing.
No worms, no distemper, no encephalitis.
Whoever owns him takes good care of him.
Sure does.
He's a superb cat.
"A superb cat"?
He's a menace.
MAN ON TAPE: "Not dreaming, noble lady, whence it is
"That I am taken with strange semblances"
"Seeing thy face, which is so fair to see
"For else, compassion would not suffer me
"To grieve my heart with such..."
"...with such harsh scoff as these
"With such harsh..."
"Or else compassion would not suffer me
"To grieve my heart with such harsh scoffs..."
"And bears his mastership so mightily
"That all my troubled senses he thrusts out
"Sorely tormenting some, and slaying some till none but he is left and has free range
"To gaze on thee
This makes my face..."
Hey!
Hey, wait a minute!
All right, you wanna come on down from there?
Come on,
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Watch out.
How'd you get up there?
Here, let me help.
What the hell were you doing back there?
Sketching.
Sketching?
That animal's not even supposed to be out.
Why'd you run away like that?
You scared me.
But the leopard doesn't?
You can sense how an animal feels.
Oh, you can?
Yeah, sometimes.
We're all connected.
Who are you?
Irena Gallier.
Who are you?
I'm the curator here.
The zoo's been closed for an hour and a half.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I feel dizzy.
Jesus, you're burning up.
Come on,
I'll get you something.
Oh, no.
Come on, come on, come on.
I don't bite.
Here, take these.
Oh, I don't believe in medicine.
It's aspirin.
No, thank you.
I'm exhausted, that's all.
I flew in the day before yesterday, went sightseeing, forgot to eat, and when you started chasing me,
I just got all excited.
Yeah, I do sometimes have that effect on women.
Oh, really?
No, that was a joke.
I don't wanna keep this on anymore.
It's wetting up my hair.
Thank you.
It'll reduce the temperature.
No, it's down already. Feel.
Just because it feels cooler to the touch doesn't mean the temperature's gone.
I'll go get a thermometer.
Oh, please.
I've always had a weird metabolism.
Really.
I just need some food and I'm all right.
How about you? You wanna have some dinner with me?
Yeah, sure, great.
If you feel up to it.
I feel hungry.
I know a reasonably good steak place.
Oh, I don't eat meat.
MAN: I thought you were supposed to be on a diet!
WOMAN: It was not that fattening!
MAN: Oh, sure.
You don't look like a curator.
I look exactly like a curator.
No, you don't.
Well, you haven't met many curators.
I guess not.
What does a curator do?
Different things.
Buys animals, sells animals, veterinary work, research, arranges the exhibits.
Maybe gets an expedition, if he lucks out on a donation or a grant.
Expedition?
Like into the jungle?
Mostly it's the bureaucratic jungle.
We purchase most of our exhibits from animal dealers.
How long have you worked at the zoo?
Ten years.
No, eleven years now.
But I've been into zoology ever since I was a kid.
I prefer animals to people.
What about you?
I'm looking for a job.
My brother Paul's supposed to help me.
If he ever gets back.
He's been gone for two days now.
How do you eat these?
You take this little wedge of lemon like this and squirt it on your oyster.
Then hit it with some of this horseradish and red sauce...
Just a touch. Pick it up and let that sucker slide down your throat.
What kind of job you looking for?
Well, commercial art, mainly.
I've taken art lessons.
And then you chase it down real quick with a swig of beer.
Or Coca-Cola.
Look. How would you like to work at the zoo?
The zoo...
That would be fascinating, but no,
I'm not really qualified.
You're qualified to work in the gift shop.
They need help in there.
If you're interested,
I could pull a few strings.
You could?
Sure.
I'll talk to the curator.
I'll be right back.
Right in the pool, girls.
Jean, let's go, in the pool.
Come on, girls, in the pool, let's go! Up, up, come on, bath time.
ALICE: Good morning.
Morning.
Alice.
I put the new tape in here.
You want to give it a listen?
Yeah.
It sounds terrific.
JOE: Old Tom's about due for a worming.
Want me to handle that?
Yeah.
Hey, Tom.
Why are you so dressed up today?
I have a meeting.
Where?
In my office.
Hi, Angel.
Hi, Angel.
The cheetah's been a bit of a problem.
He's been acting really weird.
I don't know quite what to do.
Diet?
Yeah.
Light day, fast day, five days regular.
Vary it but keep it balanced.
Some muscle meat, viscera.
Viscera?
A few bones now and then, plus the vitamin supplements'll straighten him out.
JOE: Okay, I'll try that.
How's the black leopard?
Fine.
A little extra protein never hurts...
Joe.
Oh, little rats-a-roni.
Yeah.
Ratatouille.
Rat tartar?
Like I said, the pay ain't great.
No, I really like it.
I like to be around the animals.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Ali the alligator.
Bambi and Oscar the orangutans.
Every now and then you gotta feed these guys a pillow.
What?
Nothing.
Just plain horsemeat.
Pardon me, you don't have to kill it.
Hey, Mr. Fabulous.
Here...
Eat, damn it!
MAN: I feel so helpless!
SARAH: I know, I know.
Let it out. Let it all out.
MAN: You don't know what it was like, Sarah.
Coming into the house and finding her lying on the floor, through all that smoke.
I'm sorry.
I told myself I was going to stop crying on your shoulder after that trial thing.
I'm sorry.
JOE: B.J.!
If I'd stopped on the way home from work for a beer, she...
SARAH: But you didn't.
And that's what you've got to remember. You didn't stop...
Pancho. What happened?
Did they operate? Here.
MAN: And my Rosemary lying there with my baby inside of her.
BOY 1: Come on,
Brett, let's go.
No.
BOY 2: We'll be late. We gotta go. Hurry up. What's wrong with that thing?
BOY 1: Come on.
BOY 2: Come on. Let's go.
ALICE: Take it easy.
I thought you guys are supposed to be courteous.
You have to hurt it, or it won't respond.
What you got?
Empire Strikes Back gum.
Quarter.
Thank you.
Hi. I'm Alice.
Irena.
You're Oliver's friend.
Yeah.
Well, we just met a few days ago, actually.
You're not from New Orleans.
No.
Strange, isn't it?
People are crazy here.
I think it's the humidity.
Have you seen much of the city?
No. I'd like to, though.
Why don't we have a drink after work?
I can help you work out a little itinerary.
Okay. Fine.
Okay. Ciao.
Just hit it real hard.
There you go.
MAN: That color really looks good on you. Where'd you get that outfit?
Excuse me.
MAN: Where the hell did she come from?
Jesus. Don't encourage these assholes, please.
How do you not encourage them?
I tell 'em
I'm gay.
What if they believe you?
I should be so lucky.
If you wanna get laid, you can do a lot better than that, believe me.
I was just being friendly.
I was not trying to get laid.
Occasionally they're compatible.
I wouldn't know.
How come?
I just never met anybody
I liked enough to have sex with.
Never?
Not so far, no.
Really? You're still a virgin?
Don't make it sound so perverse.
Oh, no, not at all.
Just incomprehensible, maybe.
Especially these days.
Oh, you must have come close once or twice.
Yeah, once or twice.
How close?
Come on.
The first parents
I lived with...
The mother was okay, but the father was...
Oh, a lech?
Yeah. He used to grab me when I went by him.
Overhand or underhand?
I know the type.
And there was this one boy...
What?
ALICE: Friend of yours?
No, I never saw her before.
What did she say?
"Mi hermana."
My sister.
She's probably drunk.
So what happened?
What?
I don't remember...
The boy you liked.
Oh, right. We petted and stuff like that.
He wanted to go all the way and so did I, but...
But I don't know,
I got scared.
He looked so...
What?
Huge.
God. What's his name? Quick.
Oh, I guess
I'm a romantic.
When it's right, it'll happen.
It'll be magical.
I'm not knocking it.
Here's to the magic.
It's the same with every bureaucracy.
You think you have things worked out with these people and then they won't meet you halfway.
I don't know what to tell you.
What's new pussycat?
What's new pussycat?
Pussycat, pussycat, I love you
Yes, I do
You and your pussycat smell
Come on, fella,
I gotta clean out the bunkers.
Clean it out, it'll be real nice for you. Move it.
You're supposed to be in the back there.
Back through the door, guy.
He won't cooperate.
He's afraid.
JOE: Come on, come on.
JOE: Hey, hey, move, move.
Come on, come on.
Careful, careful, stay back.
Come on, back up.
Would you back up, please?
Go to the back.
Hey, Oliver!
Yeah.
Bring the prod.
He's going ape.
Simmer down!
Okay, that's fine.
Hey, come on!
Oliver?
ALICE: Oh, no! Oh, God!
OLIVER: Call the paramedics!
Call them. Call them.
You shouldn't be doing this.
ALICE: He's only 26 years old.
OLIVER: We better tell the police.
The leopard's gone.
Female?
Paul.
Paul, where were you?
In prison.
Prison?
What for?
I was praying for the condemned.
Oh, Paul, Paul, forgive me.
I saw somebody killed today.
Somebody I knew.
I didn't think you were ready, but you are.
I knew it when
I saw you with him.
Who?
Oliver?
You want to fuck him, don't you?
You dream about fucking him!
Your whole body burns.
It burns all along your nerves, and your mouth, your breasts.
You go wet between your legs.
Stop it!
Every time it happens, you tell yourself that it's love, but it isn't.
It's blood. Death.
You can't escape the nightmare without me. And I can't escape without you.
I've waited a long time for you.
Paul, don't you touch me.
But I'm the only one who can touch you, and you're the only one who can touch me.
Don't you see?
We're safe together because we're the same.
I am not like you.
Oh, yes, you are.
You've always known it.
Do you remember, when you were a child, the animals used to call your name?
And you knew in the dark when the others were dreaming, and you could never get to sleep.
You're insane.
No. No, I'm not.
I'm not in love.
What will you do? Will you leap through his hoop?
Take his head in your mouth like an egg?
I need you.
Who are you?
I need you!
I need you!
I need you!
Don't touch.
You're not my brother! No!
Stop.
What's wrong?
Can I help you?
COP: Are you sure everything's all right?
Honest, really! I thought someone was chasing me.
It must have been just somebody out walking.
I'm sorry I got so excited.
I just got scared.
All right.
I'd be glad to write it up.
No! No, no, thank you.
Is everything all right, Bill?
Yeah.
Turned out to be nothing.
Good. Quiet! Shut up, idiot.
COP: What's wrong?
I don't know.
Something strange.
He senses something.
We better look into it.
Let me call it in.
I was sleeping.
I didn't hear anything!
Are you sure?
What about the basement?
I suppose you don't know anything about the basement, either?
Basement.
Oh, I don't go there.
What do we hear from the guys at the lab?
They're on their way.
Miss Perrin,
Doctor Yates?
You're with the zoo, right?
OLIVER: Yeah.
Come with me.
I wanna show you something.
At least we know now where the leopard came from.
Follow me.
ALICE: What's that smell?
OLIVER: I don't know.
DETECTIVE: Yeah, the dog picked up the scent real strong.
You should have seen him.
He went crazy.
Take a look.
There's pieces of three or four bodies in there.
Probably more buried around.
Oh, God.
I expect Gallier killed them first, possibly as part of some ritual, then fed them to the leopard.
We found some others, too, over the years.
Mostly prostitutes, female runaways, half-eaten, genitals torn out.
But why?
Listen, who knows?
Gallier's been in and out of psycho wards since he was 12.
He's a religious fanatic.
Where could he possibly have found a cat like this?
And how could he have handled it by himself?
He was raised around them, at least until he was 10.
His folks were carnival people, lion trainers, till they blew their brains out one night.
And what about Irena, is she involved?
OLIVER: What are you suggesting?
Irena hadn't even met her brother until a week ago.
We have no reason to suspect her.
In fact, it looked as if he'd planned to kill her, too.
And if I was her,
I'd find me another place to live.
I'll take care of that.
Don't touch me.
Watch it, lady.
Okay, take her in.
It's an old MG.
I bought it two years ago.
I've been fixing it ever since.
The room's upstairs, if you're tired and wanna lie down.
I've been using this room as a darkroom, so it might be a little cluttered.
I'm gonna grab a few hours' sleep.
I thought we might be going out to the country, first thing in the morning.
If you need anything,
I'll be right across the way.
He couldn't be my brother.
My brother wouldn't have done those things.
No, I'm sure he wouldn't.
Well, good night.
Look at that boat.
Look at that crane.
Look at that boat.
This is it.
Bayou Plantation.
One of these days
I'm gonna buy you a plantation.
Let's get the boat.
It's that or we have to swim.
Open the back?
Pardon me?
Open this here?
Hey, Oliver.
OLIVER: Hey, Yeatman.
I opened her up and aired her out.
Yeatman, you old choupique fish, you.
How the hell are you?
And you, redneck?
Hey, Yeatman, this is Irena.
Irena, this is
Yeatman Brewer.
Oh, she's mighty pretty.
Here, let me help you with your bags.
Sure.
Yeatman helped me build this place.
He also helped me tear it apart a few nights.
You draw this in real slow and I think there's a crab on here, okay?
Then I draw him across...
Don't lift the net up!
Don't lift the net up.
Okay, now lift the net up.
You got them.
You got two of them!
All right.
Not bad.
My God, look, they're crazy.
Now, you take them and you dump them in that basket.
Not on me.
This one doesn't want to come off.
Look at this.
WOMAN: Billie, me and Ted are going back to the hotel and take a nap before dinner, okay?
BILLIE: Okay, honey. Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
Is there anything you wouldn't do, Billie?
BILLIE: Look, how dreary.
PAUL: Hold it right there.
I'm sorry.
Were you talking to me?
May I take your picture?
I'd love it.
Say cheese.
Cheese.
Listen.
What?
Can't you hear it?
Yeah, that's alligators.
They're gonna eat us.
Alligators.
Yeah.
There's only one way to keep them away.
You know what that is?
What?
You have to make love.
They hate the sound.
I can't.
Look, don't be upset, baby.
It happens.
I like you, but...
Well, that's no problem, hon,
I like you, too.
You don't understand.
Oh, sure,
I do.
You're just a little nervous, that's all.
I know how to take care of men like you.
You just need some time.
Every time I pray it won't happen again.
Well, you got very, very beautiful hair.
Thank you.
Oh, relax, it's no big deal.
Momma will make it better.
Oh, that's better.
That's much, much better.
Don't look at me!
OLIVER: Detective?
Looks like we got us another murder.
The leopard?
Yeah.
The girl came back late last night with a man, early 30s, brown hair.
Our people put the actual time of the death at around 3:00.
Who was she?
Who knows?
A tourist, maybe.
Now get this.
He picked her up at a cemetery.
Can we look?
Hope you haven't had breakfast.
Come on.
OLIVER: Where you going?
Hey? Where you going?
I'm leaving.
I have to.
What? Wait!
Where you going?
Somewhere!
I can't stay here any more.
What? What?
Why? Why? Why?
Why?
Just say why.
Why?
Can't you see?
What?
Can't you see
I'm going crazy, just like him?
Who? Paul? Paul?
He has nothing to do with you.
I don't even think he's your brother.
Listen, Irena,
I'm 34 years old.
I spent most of my life looking for somebody I even wanted to be in love with.
Now that I found you,
I'm not gonna let you go.
I love you.
Oh, yeah?
Would you love me just as much if we could never sleep together?
Don't be stupid.
Yes.
I love you and I wanna take care of you and that's all that's important.
I'm afraid.
Of what?
I'm afraid for you.
Irena, you don't understand.
I'm afraid so much.
I'll always love you.
I loved you before you were born.
IRENA: I don't know.
OLIVER: Come on in.
The bag.
BILL: The leopard's probably out of the parish by now, unless he's dead.
OLIVER: I'll believe it when I see it.
I don't think you're gonna see it.
What do you mean?
Well, I've been talking to the Sheriff's department.
They're gonna call it off.
We can't afford the manpower anymore or the time.
It's been over a week now.
What are you, out of your mind?
Look, they set their traps, they did everything they could. What do you want?
Is that what you're gonna say the next time it kills somebody?
Hey, don't give me that shit, Oliver.
You were the one who wouldn't shoot the bastard when we had him in a cage.
Look, man, I'm sorry, okay?
I don't know why I did that.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, well, fuck you!
He's right.
No, he's not.
Yeah, well, how the hell would you know?
What?
What?
Nothing.
How's Irena feeling?
Fine.
You wanna talk about it?
Talk about what?
Jesus, what do you think?
Irena's gonna be all right.
I don't even...
Irena's not the one
I'm worried about.
Her type will always be all right.
Her type?
What the hell does that mean?
Look,
I'm not blind,
Oliver.
I've seen you obsessed before.
Not like this.
I even thought
I'd seen you in love before.
I guess that was just my vanity.
Let's talk about something else, all right?
Okay. All right.
I know what I'm doing.
Save me.
Only you can stop this killing.
You've got to make love with me as brother and sister.
I've searched for you for so long, from one foster home to another.
We can live together as mates, just as our parents did.
You do know that they were brother and sister, don't you?
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
No.
Make love with me and save both of us.
No.
I'm not like you.
Well, that's the lie that will kill your lover.
At least let me spare you that horror.
Come on, come on.
Come and lie next to me.
No!
Oliver doesn't love you.
He loves the panther.
He wants you because he fears you.
Let Alice have him.
She thinks his fear is courage and he thinks his fear is love.
Well, they were made for each other.
So were we.
Take my hand.
No.
Then you leave me with no choice.
Oh, Paul.
I'll come with you, okay?
We'll go together, you and I, okay?
And it'll be all right.
ALICE: I'm gonna make some coffee.
OLIVER: Sure.
I'll get some towels.
Irena, I'm back.
Alice is here.
We're gonna fix a pot of coffee.
Why don't you join us?
Irena.
Oliver!
Alice!
Oliver?
Alice, get me a gun.
Get me a shotgun!
Paul, he is dead?
Then you have no one.
Who am I?
What am I...
Shh.
Don't ask what you already know.
No, Female,
I don't know.
What...
I don't know where to go.
Live as he did.
Hidden. In chains.
Never love.
Pretend the world is what men think it is.
Wait!
Don't leave me like this.
I don't know where to go.
It doesn't matter where you go, does it?
Where to?
How far will that take me?
Where do you wanna go?
North.
Richmond.
PAUL: Long ago, our ancestors sacrificed their children to the leopards.
The souls of the children grew inside the leopards until the leopards became human.
We were gods then.
We are an incestuous race.
We can only make love with our own, otherwise we transform.
And before we can become human again, we must kill.
Welcome home.
Irena.
Mother.
PAUL: You must return.
Hi, Sandy.
Hi, Alice.
You're late.
We're closing.
Oh, just a quick dip.
Please, I really need it tonight.
Okay, five minutes.
Yes. Thanks.
Hey, has it been five minutes yet?
Hey, Sandy?
What's wrong, Alice?
Why are you following me?
Following you?
Don't deny it!
Hey, what's going on?
I know you wanna kill me.
Kill you?
I was looking for Oliver.
I tried the hospital but he was already out.
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
Hey, what's going on?
Nothing.
Oh, God.
Hello?
ALICE: Oliver.
Yeah.
Are you all right?
I called before.
Yeah.
Oliver,
Irena followed me tonight.
This is gonna sound crazy, but I think she wanted to hurt me.
Oliver?
OLIVER: Yeah?
Should I come over?
No. Stay where you are.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Oliver?
Are you scared?
Please, Irena.
Oliver? They spotted a leopard near the bridge.
Okay.
Let's go.
Hold it. Hold it.
Oliver Yates.
I'm from the zoo.
ALICE: From the
New Orleans Zoo.
Just a minute. Okay.
Go on through.
Detective Brandt called us from the zoo.
COP: No. You can't go out there.
MAN OVER RADIO: Car 317 patrol. He seems to be settling down.
Stand by.
COP: Did he get away?
Oliver, where you going?
Oliver?
I killed Yeatman.
Yes, I know. Why?
You could have killed me.
I love you.
Kill me.
I can't!
You must!
No.
Then free me.
Free me.
Make love to me again.
I want to live with my own.
My own.
MAN: You looking forward to a whole bunch of little bald porcupines running out there?
ALICE: Well, whose idea was it to put the crows and the porcupines together?
Well, I figured since they didn't have anything in common, they could share the same space.
Uh, our new assistant has a new problem.
I'm sorry.
The crows are plucking the quills out of the porcupines and I don't know what to do.
Separate them.
Brilliant.
Got it?
Yes.
OLIVER: Thanks.
MAN: Sure.
I'm gonna go have some lunch, you wanna come?
Not right now.
In a few minutes, all right?
Okay. I'll see you at the house. Bye.
(THEME FROM CAT PEOPLE
PLAYING)
This is so beautiful.
You know it, Gary.
Look at her.
Do you know what I would like to do?
Shower with them.
Then, bang!
We hit the city, baby, dead on.
For a little drinks, a little nightlife, a little dancing.
Dancing.
We throw a huge party,
I mean, huge party.
Everybody's invited, women everywhere.
All these girls, they're all there.
- Naked bodies everywhere.
- Gary.
- They all know my name.
- Gary!
- What?
- Nobody likes us. Nobody.
Why are you messing with the fantasy?
We know about the reality.
Don't ruin the fantasy, OK?
And then, we're hip, man.
We're popular. We're revered.
- Man...
- We're studs.
When the smoke clears, right, those two dames fall amazingly, completely and totally in love with us, Wyatt.
Check it out.
Yo! Check us out!
Look, we're sorry about...

'Down. Down, you fool.'
You know, this isn't very scary, Gary.
"I Spit On Your Grave" is scary.
This is, um...
It's very mild.
It's timid, you know.
The old stuff is more funny than scary.
I believe the word is "camp".
It's campy.
'The moon's rising.
We've no time to lose.'
You ever see "Dawn of the Dead"?
"Dawn of the Dead" scared me.
It really scared me.
I slept with my parents for a week, OK?
I had to call my grandmother in the night to discuss my childhood with her for three hours.
I was really petrified.
'He's just resting, waiting for a new life to come.'
That would've been so much cooler if Dr. Frankenstein had made a girl.
Don't burn the butter, alright?
Ticks me off.
I mean... I personally would've made a girl, you know.
They did make a girl,
"The Bride of Frankenstein".
- I think it was released in '35.
- It was '34, alright?
She was a scag, Wyatt, she had, like, electric hair.
If they made her beautiful, she wouldn't go out with the monster.
That's a good point.
'...his insane ambition to create life.'
- Where'd your parents go, anyway?
- Cincinnati.
They're meeting the guy that my sister wants to marry.
Chloe?
Who the hell would marry Chloe?
He's studying to be a vet.
Try not to make a mess in there, Gary.
The maid doesn't come till Monday.
I don't understand something, Wyatt.
How come your parents trust you?
They never let you do shit before.
Chet's coming home from college for the weekend. They trust him.
He's in charge.
Chet? Oh, shit!
I can't believe this, Wyatt.
I really wish that you told me this before I agreed to sleep over.
You know how I feel about Chet.
How do you put up with that guy?
If I don't, he beats the shit out of me.
It's a habit he picked up in military school.
How do you put up with that putz?
What can I say?
He's very protective of me.
Nice relationship.
'...there you have his mad dream.
'Look! There's nothing to fear.
'Look... no blood, no decay, just a few stitches.
'Go on. Fix the electrodes.
'You'll have plenty to be afraid of before the night's over.
'The storm will be magnificent.
'All the electrical secrets of heaven.
'And this time we're ready.
Hey, Fritz?
'Let's have one final test.
Throw the switches.'
'Here in this machine,
I have discovered the great ray
'that first brought life into the world.
'And, look, here's the final touch.
'The brain you stole, Fritz.
Think of it.
'The brain of a dead man waiting to live again
'in a body I made with my own hands...'
- You know, that's not a bad idea.
- What?
'In 15 minutes, the storm should be at its height...'
Making a girl.
Actually making a girl.
Just like Frankenstein.
Except cuter.
- You're serious.
- Yes.
Look me in the eyes.
Do I look serious?
- 'You're crazy!'
- 'Crazy, am I?
'We'll see whether I'm crazy or not.'
Gary Wallace, that's absolutely gross.
That's sick.
I'm not digging up dead girls. It's...
No, I'm not talking about digging up a dead girl, Wyatt.
I'm talking about your system, idiot.
Your computer.
OK, you know how you're always talking how you can simulate all that stuff on your computer, you know?
What's the difference?
Why can't we simulate a girl?
I don't know.
I guess I could, but why?
It's two-dimensional on the screen.
It's not flesh and blood, Gary.
I know that, but we can use it, Wyatt.
We can ask it questions.
We can put it in real-life sexual situations and see how it reacts.
Like real sick, demented shit.
You'd love it.
Well, what about your girl in, um...
Canada?
She lives in Canada. This girl has no morals. I don't like that in a girl.
It's rough having those kind of relationships. You'll see.
Anyway, get to work.
Very nice.
I'm telling you, Wyatt. If there's one thing I know, it's female stats.
Anything bigger than a handful, you're risking a sprained tongue.
You know, and...
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Perfect.
- OK. Now what?
Should we give her a brain?
- Yeah. We can play chess with her.
- Chess?
Just give her a brain, OK?
OK, that's about all we can do with my stuff.
I can't believe this shit.
I can't believe this.
Did you get a free toaster with this, too?
Gary, it's smarter than you, OK?
- The problem is, it's a lame idea, OK?
- It's not a lame idea.
The problem is your computer's a wimp and we need a lot more power than this.
What do you suggest?
'We have code penetration, we have program entry.
'I repeat, we have code penetration, we have program entry.
'Activate LAN trace.'
We're in.
We're in trouble, Gary.
This is highly illegal.
Well, you need more input.
We got to fill this thing up with data.
We gotta make her as real as possible, Wyatt.
I want her to live,
I want her to breathe.
I want her to aerobicize.
'It's live! All Dave, all night!
'We know what you need.
Only right here on Dave TV!'
Look at this. It's moving, it's working.
It's doing itself.
It's working by itself.
Gary?
By the way, why are we wearing bras on our heads?
Ceremonial.
- You ready?
- Yeah. Let's go.
- Turn it off!
- It is off!
Hang up the phone!
- Wyatt, what's going on?
- I don't know!
- Well, unplug it!
- OK!
Oh, shit!
No! It was a birthday present!
Oh, shit!
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!
Oh, shit! We got to get this thing out of your house!
You get it out! It was your idea!
This is all your fault, you son of a bitch!
Hit the lights out!
You get it out!
I'll get it out!
- Whoa!
- Aargh!
Ah, shit!
One, two, three.
'She's alive. Alive!'
So... what would you little maniacs like to do first?
You guys created me.
I didn't come from anywhere.
Before you started messing around with your computer, I didn't even exist.
By the way... you did an excellent job.
Thank you.
Hello?
Showering's real fun, isn't it?
If we're going to have any kind of fun together, you guys had better loosen up.
What are we going to do with her?
Look... we'll just go with the situation, OK?
I'm sure by Sunday, you'll think of something.
You're a very bright guy.
I have a lot of faith in you, OK?
- Alright?
- I'm just being practical.
Well, I know you are, OK?
And I appreciate it.
Let's go.
What are we going to do about this mess?
Wyatt, you'll have plenty of time to clean up tomorrow, OK?
OK, but don't get any B.O. on Chet's suit, or he'll kill me.
- Where are we going, anyway?
- I dunno.
She said we're going to go downtown...
Oh, my God! Whose stuff is this?
- Is that your suit? Wait, is this yours?
- Oh, shit.
Holy shit!
Wyatt, what's going on here?
- Gary, I don't know!
- I don't know what's going on here!
You look good, though, alright?
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- So, did you steal this car?
- No, I didn't steal the car.
How'd you get it?
I can get anything I want.
- And right now, I want to party.
- Party?
Yeah, and you better think up a name for me, too.
What name do you want?
You guys created me, you think of a name for me.
How about Lisa?
Why Lisa?
Why not?
- He used to like a girl named Lisa.
- Oh, yeah? Old girlfriend?
She kicked him in the nuts.
Will you shut up?
Look, Gary, it wasn't your fault.
All you said was hello to her.
Yeah, look, Wyatt, shut up!
Hey, guys, I like Lisa.
That'll do just fine.
OK, you guys ready to rock?
- Ready.
- Ready.
- Lisa?
- Yeah?
- I don't think we belong here.
- Don't be silly. It's a public place.
Look, I'm sure we'd both love to stay, but we're not 21, so I think...
You're 21. You're 21.
Well, maybe you'd feel better if you just got out there and mingled.
We don't mingle, OK?
Well, maybe you'd be comfortable if I invited all these people back to your house and we could all mingle there.
- We'll mingle.
- We'll mingle.
Hi, dudes.
Well, goddamn!
Listening to this blues music reminds me of my own trials and tribulations as a young guy and, uh...
You know, my folks, they really, really dump on me. They really do.
So, you guys get along with your parents?
I guess you guys moved out by now though, huh?
- Uh, what's this, sir?
- Drink it.
Uh...
That's a very sweet thought of both you gentlemen, but I really don't...
Until now.
See you guys in the emergency room, huh?
Hello, pretty lady.
Tell me something.
What's a beautiful broad like you doing with a malaka like this, huh?
It's purely sexual.
No shit.
She's into malakas, Dino.
She's into malakas!
Do you believe that?
You can say that again!
Fats, man... let me tell you my story, man.
Last year, I was insane for this crazy little 8th-grade bitch.
- OK?
- Crazy insane?
- Insane?
- Crazy?
I was nuts for the woman, man.
Now you gotta believe me,
I'm telling the truth here.
I'm speaking to you.
I mean, I was nuts for the girl.
And what did it to me was these big titties she had.
For a 13-year-old girl, man!
She wouldn't have had to worry about no titties for the rest of her life, boy.
You know, she was set and she was looking good.
That's the truth, baby.
I called her every night for, like, a month.
I mean, I'm talking devotion, man.
Every damn night?
Every night, Mitch.
I ain't playing with you.
On the telephone?
What's this boy talking about, on the telephone, man?
Explain it to him.
Goddamn.
We know there's a telephone, boy!
- What the hell he think I'm doing?
- But he hung up on her.
Oh, you didn't hang up on her?
The chick with those big, big titties?
I hung up on the bitch.
Now here's the capper.
- You know what the bitch did to me?
- Lay it on me.
Check this shit out.
Listen to what she did to me. She...
She kneed you in the nuts and called him faggot in front of everybody.
- She did what?
- Bitch kneed your nuts?
Bitch kneed my nuts!
Bitch. I'm not playing with you.
I ain't teasing, man.
- In the family jewels?
- In the family jewels, man.
- Worst pain there is.
- Broke my heart in two.
- She broke more than your heart.
- You're right there, baby.
You can forget that other one.
You got this fine jewel sitting right over here by you.
- Yeah.
- Ain't that the truth, baby?
- That's the plain truth...
- Uh-oh, there he goes!
- Party's over.
- Party's over, said the girl.
I'm gonna get out of here. I got money for you right here. $50 for you.
- I got $500 that boy won't make it.
- I bet he's gonna make it.
♪ Ooh, baby,
Baby, you know I love you
You know, I really shouldn't be driving.
Hey, listen, I appreciate it. You know,
I really just don't feel like driving.
OK, forget it. I'll drive.
Give me the keys!
Give me the keys!
Is he going to be all right?
I don't know. I warned him about that Blind Dog bourbon.
Hey, he don't even have his license, Lisa.
He's not lying.
I don't even have a learner's permit.
Hey, let's scout another party, man.
What are you gonna tell Chet about me?
Nothing.
Nothing?
That's not very realistic, Wyatt.
Look, I don't know. I'm just trying to concentrate on the road.
You better concentrate a little harder.
You're about to run a red light.
Oh, shit!
I hate that boy!
I always hated that shit!
I never listen to him!
I hate this car! I hate it!
Are you OK?
Well, my nuts are halfway up my ass, but other than that, I'm perfect!
You better think of what you're going to do about Chet.
He's one serious idiot.
You're stewed, butt wad!
Who, me?
Know what time it is?
Um... 2:00?
Time to pay the fiddler.
Um... I was kind of counting on you to be human about this.
Here's the bottom line, Wyatt.
I'm telling Mom and Dad everything.
I'm even considering making up some shit.
Alright, Chet, name your price.
$175 and zero cents, cash.
New bills, crisp and clean, in my wallet by 7:00 a.m.
Thank you.
Hey, what are big brothers for?
See you upstairs.
- I don't need you.
- Shh!
The boozehounds return.
What a joke!
Hi, girls.
Feeling kind of queasy?
How about... a nice greasy pork sandwich served in a dirty ashtray?
He pukes, you die.
He's not laughing at you, Chet.
It's just...
Yes, I am.
Did you tell Chet about...? Did he tell you about the woman we made tonight?
He's obviously had it.
He doesn't know what he's talking about.
- No shit?
- No shit, Chet. No shit.
You two donkey dicks couldn't get laid in a morgue.
You're right.
You are absolutely right.
- You're absolutely right, Chet...
- Get him outta here.
- What?
- Come on.
Cold-blooded shit he is.
He's an asshole.
Look at his haircut. Anybody with a haircut like that you know is an asshole...
Psst! Lisa.
Where are you?
I'm right behind you.
Surprise!
I'm not going to hurt you, you silly thing.
I mean, your lips.
They feel like rigor mortis has set in.
Why don't you try and relax a little bit?
I'm only kissing you.
I wasn't expecting you to kiss me.
I was just...
That was better.
Want to try it again?
If you don't mind.
I mean, yes, please, ma'am.
- You sure you're only 15?
- I'll be 16 in June.
You made me.
You control me.
What's on your mind?
What are you thinking about, huh?
Um...
Women's gymnastics.
Well, I don't know.
I'll do my best.
Good.
Wyatt, Wyatt, Wyatt, where are you?
- I'm right here, Gary.
- Wyatt, what happened?
I don't know.
I think it was a dream.
What?
Everything. Last night. Lisa.
The whole thing, it had to be a dream.
It can't be a dream, Wyatt.
We were both in it.
How can two people have the same dream?
There's no other explanation.
It had to be a dream.
Wait, let's analyze this.
Alright, in your dream... did I get up in the middle of the night and yak in your sink?
Didn't throw up. No. Nothing.
You didn't see anything.
Maybe it was a dream, you know.
A very weird, bizarre, vivid...
...erotic, wet, detailed dream.
Maybe we have malaria.
Shit.
Gary! Wyatt! Breakfast!
Look, I don't have the kind of bucks it would take to pay Chet off about this.
Yo, Wyatt! Coffee!
You can't live in fear of Chet for the rest of your life.
Why not? Just please...
I don't know, Wyatt. I mean, it's seriously affecting your sex life.
Ten seconds into my gymnastics routine, you passed out.
You slept.
I did my toes.
By the way, you're very cute.
We'll try it again some other time, OK?
- Good morning, turd brain.
- Hi, Chet.
- You spit in this?
- Not that I'm aware of, no.
Hey, that looks pretty good.
Now make yourself one, dick weed.
I like your panties.
It's a joke, Chet. You know, it's all...
That's not a joke!
That is a severe behavioral disorder.
Those are women's underpants!
The next thing you know, you'll be wearing a bra on your head.
The old man's gonna have a stroke on this one for sure.
Alright, Chet. How much?
How much?
Oh, this goes way beyond payment, pal.
Come on, Chet. Please?
Well...
Your VCR should cover it.
For openers.
Thank you.
For Christ's sakes, will you cover yourself?
You guys looking for something for your mom?
I really don't think so... Sue.
You guys have, uh... girlfriends?
You know, Sue, one does really not refer to a 23-year-old woman as a girlfriend.
- A mistress, Gar.
- Mistress.
- Lover.
- Sexpot.
She's a sexpot is what she is.
You guys are the ones that got beat up at the homecoming game, right?
Hmm...
Uh... Susan, do you think you could wrap up a bottle of this scent for me?
- I like this.
- Um... two.
And why don't you set yourself up with one of them, too.
Set yourself up.
That's three scents, please.
- If you were a 15-year-old boy...
- Hmm...
- ...would these turn you on?
- Hmm...?
I think so, too. I'll take them.
Uh... do you have a bra to match that?
Something in leather or rubber, or barb wire?
Give me a break.
Check it out. Check it out.
What?
Five bucks?
Finsky.
Max, what are you gonna do?
- You know what, Gar?
- Hmm?
For the first time in my life,
I don't feel like a total dick.
Yeah, me either.
Sorry, boys.
Momentary loss of motor nerves.
Getting tired of this? We're not.
But I'll tell you, there is a cure.
Rumor has it, there's a big white sale going on.
- At Towel World!
- Towel World!
- We're not impressed.
- No.
Can I have some of that, please?
You know I'm getting really bored of their shit.
- Well, do you wanna dump them?
- I don't know.
We have been with them three months.
We've been to the parties, met the people.
We won't go to any more parties and we won't meet any more people.
We'll go into a social coma.
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
We're sorry.
- Wanna give them another chance?
- OK.
- Will you forgive us?
- Please.
Oh, you guys.
What are we gonna do with you?
♪ Whoo!
♪ Pretty woman, walking down the street
♪ Pretty woman, the kind I like to meet

Hi.
- That's Ian.
- This is Max.
We call him Mad Max.
- We saw you on the escalator.
- Yeah.
Yeah, you were looking at us, right?
Yeah.
- So what are you doing?
- Nothing. I'm waiting for my ride.
Lis, come on, hon. We're running late.
Honey, move.
Speak to you later.
She likes the rough stuff.
What can I do, you know?
By the way, there's a party tonight at Wyatt's house.
You can find his name in the students' directory under Donnelly.
Pass the word around.
Party?
Don't ask.
Wyatt, you're gonna have a heart attack by the time you're 40 if you don't learn to relax.
Have you tried inversion boots?
Lisa, you don't understand my parents.
What's there to understand?
They're oppressive, meddlesome, difficult, demanding and totally bizarre.
I mean, they're normal parents.
Now stop worrying and go and get dressed.
Lisa, I created you.
Why do you do insist on doing things I don't want?
Honey buns, you want to party so badly, you could bottle it.
I mean, you and Gary, you want friends, you want popularity, you want all that stuff, right?
Well, I've thought about it, sure, but...
So I'm giving it to you.
Thank you, really, thank you.
But I don't want it in my house.
If you want to be a party animal, you have to learn to live in the jungle.
Now stop worrying and go and get dressed.
I'm going to go and pick up Gary.
I can't wait to meet his parents.
Do you go to Gary's school?
Do I look like I'm in high school?
No.
Well, what it is, Dad, she's a foreign exchange student, you know, and they have, like, a different educational system around the world.
You look very, er...
...mature.
Doesn't she? That's funny you say that cos I was thinking the same thing.
And what happened was that, uh...
So what do you do for a living, Al?
I'm an independent businessman.
Al... Dad... My dad's a plumber.
And he's into plumbing.
And, well, I guess you plumb, right, Dad?
Yeah.
Yeah, well, I, uh...
- I think it's time to go. You ready?
- Where do you think you're going?
- To a party.
- To a movie.
Movie party is what it is, folks.
- We're going to a movie party.
- Such a little liar.
No, I've whipped up this nasty little
soirée over at his friend Wyatt's house.
- "Soir" what?
- Soirée, honey. I think that means party.
Party.
You know, there's going to be sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll, chips, dips, chains, whips...
You know, your basic high school orgy type of thing.
I mean, I'm not talking candle wax on the nipples or witchcraft or anything like that.
No, no, no, no, just a couple of hundred kids running around in their underwear acting like complete animals.
Alright, goddamn it! I've heard enough!
- Gary, you get to your room!
- Yes, sir!
No, it's OK. Just sit here.
I'll take care of this.
Girlie, you get the hell outta here before I throw you out.
Don't threaten me, Al!
You're out of shape.
I'll kick your arse.
I'm going to make this real easy for you.
I'm taking Gary to a party.
Over my dead body.
He's a good kid. He studies hard.
You've got no complaints.
If anybody should be bitching, it should be Gary.
You ever compliment him on his grades?
You ever compliment him on anything?
Hey! Hey!
Look, Ma, compliments embarrass me.
- Dad, you know...
- Shut up!
Have you ever wondered how sad it is that your son's only sexual outlet is tossing off to magazines in the bathroom?
Oh, Gary!
Ma, I never tossed off to anything!
- You told me you were combing your hair!
- But I was! I was! Mom!
- Gary, shut up!
- The water's running all day long...
- Shut up!
- I've never tossed off!
- I've never tossed off!
- And you wouldn't tell your own mother!
Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up!
This guy deserves a party.
Look, I don't know who you are, what you are, or where you came from, but I'm not taking any more of this.
Dial the police, Lucy.
Dial the damn police and give me the phone.
The phone...
I'm going to get the...
- Give me the phone.
- I'm trying to... Well, here it is.
Jesus, God. Oh, Christ.
Oh, Lord God.
Oh... Uh-oh...
Go ahead...
Make your day?
I'm really sorry it has to come to this.
Come to what?
If you don't cheer up,
I'll blow your face off.
Oh, come on, don't be such an old lady.
Everything's cool.
Everything's cool!
Everything's cool.
Yeah, yeah.
My dad's going to castrate me.
And my mother almost had, like, a cardiac arrest.
My parents'll never let me in the house, and if they do, I'll be grounded till I'm 45.
Other than that, everything's great.
Everything's just really cool.
I mean, you know, it couldn't be better.
Listen, trust me for once, will you?
They don't know what happened.
Did you think Gary was acting a little strangely this evening?
Gary?
Who's Gary?
Lisa, you have to promise me that things aren't gonna get out of control.
Wyatt, don't worry.
You're just having a few friends over.
I don't have any friends, Lisa.
He doesn't.
Boy ain't lying.
You do now.
Hi.
Hi!
Party!
Party! Party! Party! Party!
Party! Party! Party! Party!
♪ Standin' there by the window
♪ Starin' out at the night
♪ You've got so many troubles
♪ On your nervous mind
♪ But don't worry, baby
♪ It's gonna work out fine
♪ You hear the sound of footsteps
♪ Stealing across the floor

Yo!
Who's here? How you doing?
How you doing?
- Where's the bar?
- Bar!
Do you think they'll embarrass us tonight?
Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Caviar?
If Max and Ian see her, it is all over for us.
- How's your stomach?
- It's a little better.
If you're gonna float an air biscuit, let me know, OK?
Float a what?
If you're gonna fart, if you're gonna squeeze cheese, let me know, OK?
I'll hit the fan.
I'm sorry, Gary, it's just I suffer pain and discomfort due to occasional stomach upset.
You know, I can't believe this, Wyatt.
I'm so disappointed in us.
All we ever do is sit around and talk about how great it would be if we went to parties, right?
And now it's our party, and there are hundreds of people here having a great time, and we're in the john. we're in the john!
- I can't believe it.
- Gary, you're just as uptight as I am.
Let me tell you something.
Nobody can be as uptight as you, OK?
Nobody.
Your middle name is tense, OK?
Wyatt "Tense Up" Donnelly.
- Alright, this is true. This is true.
- It's true.
But... it's not that bad.
I mean, we can hear the music.
We can dance, so that's great.
If we put our noses to the door, maybe we can smell the food.
Hey, brother!
What's happening, my main man?
Right on!
- Scotch.
- Straight up?
Ah, give me the whole bottle.
Tell you what... you bend over and I'll shove it straight up your ass.
On the rocks is fine.
Yeah, that's what I thought you were gonna say, you jive turkey.
There she is.
You deal with the drinks.
I'll kill the girls.
- Hi.
- Hi!
OK, OK, OK...
- Did we see you at the mall today?
- Yes.
Oh, yeah!
It's alright... Um...
- What are you doing here?
- I'm living here now.
I'm Wyatt and Gary's girlfriend.
No!
Ah! OK...
We're Wyatt's friends.
Er... can we come to the party or should we just bail?
Bail!
- No, no, come in, come on.
- Really?
Oh, thank you.
Gary and Wyatt are around here someplace.
I wonder if Lisa's having a good time.
Lisa could have a good time at an insurance seminar, Wyatt.
You know, the thing that really galls me is that she's ours and we can't get close to her.
Hit the fan.
This is, like, the best party
I've ever been to.
I know. It's great!
Do you know whose house this is?
I don't know. I think it might be that girl with the English accent.
Did you notice that girl doesn't have a zit on her whole body? Did you notice that?
- I know. She has, like, zero fat.
- And she's so relaxed.
- She burped and it was, like, charming.
- Charming.
Yeah!
Shit.
- Ah, yeah.
- The bathroom.
- Ladies.
- Hi.
Hi.
I can't believe you! I cannot...
You're dropping wolf bait and there are chicks outside!
Light a match or something!
Light a fire, I don't know.
Hi.
Hi.
We're sorry. We thought there were just girls in there.
- I'm sorry.
- It's just us dudes, you know.
What are you doing here?
Gary was just taking a shit!
No, what I meant was...
No, no, what I meant was, what are you doing at the party?
- Oh, it's my house.
- This is your party?
Yeah, well, you know, we like to do this about once a week, throw little gatherings here, little get-togethers, that kind of thing.
- Haven't you guys been by?
- No.
No? How the heck did we miss these two, Wyatt?
I don't know.
So many people, so many parties.
So many people, you know, and so many parties, you lose track...
Um... would you mind if I came in and checked my face?
What's wrong with your face?
Can we come in?
- Come on in.
- Sure, yeah. OK. Be our guests.
- Thanks, guys.
- Come on in.
Well, um...
We've seen you guys at school, but we've never met.
- You're Hilly.
- You're Deb.
- How you doing?
- Deb.
- Hi. I'm Gary.
- I'm Wyatt.
Well, what have you guys been doing?
This is a wild crowd. I didn't know you guys had so many friends.
- Yeah, neither did we.
- Neither did we.
Uh, who's the girl with the accent?
I thought that this was her party, but...
You mean the real sensuous, exotic, sexy, mature, sex symbol type?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
She's with us.
She's with you guys?
Come on, Lisa. Why not?
Because I belong to Gary and Wyatt.
Belong? What? They make you in the garage with power tools?
They own you? Control you?
- Seriously?
- Seriously.
They're toads.
Do I look like I'd go out with two toads?
You do. It's true.
I think Gary and Wyatt are gonna force everyone to redefine their terms.
And you're completely loyal to them?
I do whatever they say.
Hi.
Could you excuse us for a minute, please?
Ah, that's no problem.
Yeah, we'll be in here.
Yeah.
OK, fine.
I could be wrong, but I think these ladies are stoked for us, Wyatt.
- I got that feeling myself.
- What do we do?
- I don't know.
- Should we go for it?
- What about Lisa?
- She did say we should party.
Let's get it on with these two, score points and go back to Lisa.
This is like a dream come true.
How about if we see if we can score with these two in case we can't later?
- Sounds good.
- But we gotta give Lisa a shot.
I don't wanna hurt her feelings. The girls want a long, lean bone job from me.
- Ready to party down?
- Let's break.
- Break.
Those guys are weird, but they're kind of cute.
- Hi.
- Hi!
And where did you two disappear to?
- Nowhere. We were in the kitchen.
- We were in the bathroom.
- Eating.
- Doing our hair.
Have you met Gary and Wyatt?
- Yeah.
- No.
Sort of.
If you get the chance... shower with them.
I did. It's a mind scrambler!
Oh! Hurts so good.
She took a shower with them.
- I have a wonderful idea, Henry.
- Hmm?
After dinner, why don't we stop by and visit with Wyatt?
I hate to think of his being alone at home tonight.
- Doesn't he have anything to read?
- Well, I don't know, dear.
But you know nothing's more important to a teenage boy than his grandparents.
- We'll drop by.
- Oh, good.
I'd like to open up by apologizing for the Icee today at the mall.
It was very immature, and I'm sorry.
- And, uh...
- It was just, like, tomfoolery.
But we are sorry.
- It happened.
- Yeah.
So what's the deal with Lisa?
You know, can we borrow her?
Uh... we can't do that, guys, because common decency prohibits us, we can't.
It's not cool.
- Well, she said it was cool.
- Yeah.
We can't take advantage of her loyalty. Sorry, guys.
Man, but that's really selfish.
That hurts, you know.
Ian, uh...
Just forget it, guys, cos we can't do it, you know?
Ah, come on.
Quit being such pricks.
Hey, come on.
Regardless of what she may have told you, our feelings for Lisa run very deep.
It's, like, emotions.
Heavy, heavy emotions.
Our feelings for Deb and Hilly run as deep as yours do for Lisa.
And it's respect.
It's like the time we spent together, you know.
And a couple of guys like you deserve them.
See, we like your style.
So we wanna make a deal with you.
You let us have a crack at Lisa, and then we'll let you have
Deb and Hilly.
Can you guys keep a secret?
- Sure.
- Secret?
- Look again. It's Gary.
- No, no.
It's our boy, Gary.
He's our 16-year-old boy.
I don't know what the hell you're talking about, Lucy.
And I want you to shut up.
I feel like an asshole.
This had better work.
This is just the blueprint.
OK, now look. You like it?
Bigger tits.
Go, go, go, go!
Give him the knee-shooters.
I don't care.
'We have code penetration again.
What the hell's going on in here?'
Excuse me, Arthur.
- It's Art.
- Excuse me, Art.
Oh, shit.
♪ Weird
♪ Weird science
- 'Where's Eddie?'
- 'Eddie's down in the lab.
'He and Grandpa are working on a new project.'
'Another invention?'
'It's got something to do with a robot.'
Wyatt, what's going on?
Turn this thing off!
You're gonna love it!
How you doing?
I'm shitting in my pants!
It worked.
You had to be big shots, didn't you?
You had to show off.
When are you going to learn people will like you for what you are, not for what you can give them?
In your race for power and glory, you forgot one small detail.
We forgot to hook up the doll.
You forgot to hook up the doll.
Something's going on here, Carmen.
I have a feeling we're not going to approve, Henry.
A missile! A missile!
A missile in my house, Gary!
- Yeah, this puppy's for real, alright.
- It was an accident. Simple, you know...
Accident, my ass, Gary!
My parents are coming home.
Chet's coming home.
- They're gonna freak out!
- They're gonna shit eggrolls.
Get out! Get out! Scat!
Out of here, you disgusting tramps!
You, you, you hosers!
Out! Out! Out!
My God, cut that out, would you?
You ought to know better than to walk into somebody's house and start hitting people with your Rex Harrison hat!
This is my daughter's home.
Who the hell are you?
Well, I'm a very dear, close personal friend of your grandson's.
Henry, call the police.
I will.
I'll have you incarcerated.
Here's the deal, folks.
Gary and Wyatt, they created me on their computer.
I'm not going to stand here and listen to this baloney.
He won't, you know.
He doesn't stand for baloney.
Would you mind waiting here?
I won't be a moment.
Have you ever?
Never.
Excuse me, guys.
Wyatt, your grandparents are downstairs.
OK. Thanks, Lis.
- Lisa!
- Yes?
Where are my grandparents?
- Wyatt, your kitchen is blue.
- You want to try one?
Where are my grandparents, Lisa?
They're all taken care of, OK?
You're going to love this one.
- Are they all right?
- They're fine.
In fact, they're better than fine.
They're not aging anymore.
See? They're smiling.
Uh... Lisa, if any more of his relatives drop by, we'll be upstairs in the bathroom, OK?
That's pretty sick, Lis.
Those guys really need some self-confidence.
A challenge. Something that'll bring out their inner strength and courage.
I'm so bloody clever.
Now!
This Bud's for you.
- This party's lame, Max.
- What about the girls?
Girls, shmirls!
Lisa! What's going on?
Aargh!
Gary! Gary, Gary...
Gary, listen to me.
There are motorcycles in my house!
Wyatt, there are killer mutants in your house, OK?
Screw the house.
Guys, you have uninvited guests.
I think you better come out and ask them to leave.
They're getting pretty rowdy.
This is an excellent chance for you to prove your bravery and courage.
Those are outdated concepts, alright?
Excuse us.
Don't let John Wayne hear you say that.
The man is dead, Lisa, OK?
Well, so are you, if you don't deal with this situation.
No, thanks.
Gary, do you feel like a chicken?
Wyatt, if I could shoot an egg out my ass right now, I would.
What about all these people?
Will they think we're cowards?
I don't know.
Look, we can deal with shame, OK?
Death is a much deeper issue.
Uh... we're going to get you guys some drinks.
You look like a Scotch man.
You want some...
- We're gonna get some stuff...
- Ah!
Is this your party?
Uh...
- Well, yeah kind of.
- I don't know if you can call it a party.
It's just a few friends.
How come...
...two unpopular dicks like you is having a party?
I don't know. I mean, I guess I was just asking myself that very question.
- And I'm like dicks, sometimes...
- Look, we're very sorry.
How would you like all your friends here to know...
...that you wear a bra on your head?
Tossed off into any good books lately, have we?
You two can't even take a shower with a beautiful woman without wearing your jeans!
You!
Come here!
Now!
- Prepare to die, Wyatt.
- Gary, I can't wait to die.
- We are gonna kick...
- Ass.
OK. This is war.
Hands off the girls. Let's leave the girls out of this. Hands off.
I said hands off! Now!
Why don't you shut up, bitch?
And as for your ugly ass, let me tell you something.
You don't come into my friend's house with your faggot friends, driving your motorbikes all over his floors, breaking windows, making a mess, stinking up the place.
And believe me, you do stink.
And here's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna let go of the girls, and you're going to apologize to all these people.
And you're gonna get on your bikes and pedal your ugly asses out of here.
So now, we're gentlemen, so we're gonna give you a choice.
Yeah, you can leave in peace...
Or you can stay and die.
Choice is yours.
Get out of here.
Beg your pardon.
You have a lovely home.
Terribly sorry.
Call me. We'll have lunch.
Can we keep this between us?
I'd hate to lose my teaching job.
God bless you.
I can't believe... You know...
Is everyone alright? I just want to know.
This is so exciting.
You know, we're heroes.
These guys came into your house and we showed them down.
I can't believe this. Know what we did?
You and me saved all these people, Wyatt.
You don't understand that.
We're heroes.
This could mean a guest shot on
Phil Donahue. But this is exciting, man!
- Gary!
- What?
- Where the hell did you get that thing?
- Squirt gun, man. That's it.
That's my boys.
What a weird night, huh?
You really weren't afraid of those guys?
I was scared.
But what could I do?
It's probably a good idea for me not to ask too many questions about tonight.
Probably.
This is a sort of a night of weird shit.
I was wondering if I can ask you something kind of strange?
Would you kiss me?
What about Ian?
We all make mistakes.
- OK.
- OK...
Where do you want it?
Can I ask you a question?
Yeah.
How do you feel about Lisa?
I love her.
That's what I figured.
But, um...
...I mean, it's definitely a different kind of love, you know.
It's... it's more sisterly, you know, like big sisterly, kind of.
But she's so beautiful.
Yeah, she's really beautiful.
And her body is...
It's gorgeous.
It's a nice figure.
So...
I mean, what would I be compared to her?
Deb, Lisa is everything
I ever wanted in a girl...
...before I knew what I wanted.
I know that if I could do it again...
I'd make her just like you.
Honest.
Dead honest.
I'm like... I... You know, I...
I gotta tell you cos I'm really honest when I say that.
I'm so very honest. I mean that.
What the hell?
That little bastard. That little...
Please don't let him have messed up my room.
If my room's OK,
I won't kill him, I promise.
I'll just hurt him real bad.
Freeze.
Chet!
Where's my brother?
Ow!
Uhh... I don't know.
You're dead meat, pilgrim.
Um...
Chet, Chet, Chet, Chet, Chet, that's her nose. Come on.
Now, look, she has nothing to do with it.
OK. You die.
She walks out of here with a severe limp.
Aargh.
I'll be back.
That's Wyatt's older brother, Chet.
He's kind of an asshole.
Oh, hi, Chet.
What the hell is going on around here?
Chet, I'm sorry, it was an accident.
An accident? An accident?
Do you realize it's snowing in my room, goddamn it?
Some real weird shit happened, Chet.
Some real weird...
You don't have to be a genius to figure that out, monkey dick.
- Start talking, little man.
- Look, Chet, it's a real long story.
Gary and I were messing around with the computer Friday night, and we decided to make a woman, and she went crazy and messed up the house.
Don't smart-mouth me, you wormy little shit!
Why don't you just leave him alone?
Stay out of this, bimbo.
This is a family matter.
Chet, just let me find Lisa.
She can explain everything.
She'll clear everything up, Chet.
I swear. Chet.
You can have my college money and my social security, Chet.
Chet...
So, you guys think you can pull one over on me, huh?
Huh?
You got everybody synched to the same bullshit story.
This isn't bullshit.
This is a Pershing missile, Chip.
It's Chet.
My name is Chet.
And I didn't think it was a whale's dick, honey.
Hi, Nanny. Hi, Grampy.
I'm not a moron, you know. I...
Was that my grandparents?
- Are they dead?
- Oh, no, they're just resting.
What are they doing in here?
I put them in there.
I didn't want the boys to get into trouble.
And quite frankly, they weren't having a very good time at the party.
Not having a good time?
Do you think they're having a good time being catatonic in a closet?
Do you have any idea how disrespectful that is?
Boy, I wouldn't give a squirt of piss for your ass right now.
OK, that's quite enough.
You guys get the girls home.
Wyatt, take the Porsche.
Gary, you take the Ferrari.
The Ferrari?
I want to be alone with Chet here.
- Good to see you again, Chet.
- Get out of here!
Come on, take your little hussies home!
Their parents are probably worried sick.
Lady, I want to get to the bottom of this, A.S.A.F.P.
Oh, so do I.
But first, I'd like to... butter your muffin.
Why do you have to be such a wanker?
Because I get off on it.
Now I want you to promise that you'll keep your big mouth shut about everything that has happened here this weekend.
And I want you to treat Wyatt and Gary with dignity and respect.
Oh, really?
Yeah. Oh, really.
I can be a real serious bitch if I don't get what I want.
Ooh, hit me with your best shot.
How fast are you going?
About 35.
- Wait. This can't be right.
- Are you looking at the RPMs?
No, I think I'm looking at about fifty tickets.
Bye!
Goddamn train!
Oh, my. Phew!
That was great!
You son of a bitch!
Al! Al! Al, that was Gary!
Who is this Gary character?
I had a really great time last night.
I'll probably be grounded for a month or so, but...
I'll wait for you.
Hilly!
I love you!
Alright!
I want to thank you for a great night.
Same here.
Deb, I have kind of a confession to make.
I'm really not this cool.
That's not my car.
This is not my suit.
I mean, none of those people were my friends.
Why are you telling me all of this?
Because I want you to like me for what I am.
Whatever you are, I like it.
Well, um,
I'd better get going, cos, um...
...Wyatt and I still have to deal with Chet.
Quit screwing around!
This ain't funny, you stupid bitch!
Oh, now careful, Chet.
Don't make me angry.
Sorry.
That's better.
Would you please turn me back to normal, please?
I haven't done anything to you.
No, but you've done plenty to your brother.
- Like what?
- Well, let me see...
You've nagged him, harassed him, suppressed him, kept him in fear of you, extorted money from him.
It's done out of love.
Just for that, I ought to give you a set of elephant balls.
Give me your word that you'll leave Wyatt and Gary alone, and I'll change you back.
Oh, all right.
Shake on it, huh?
No, thanks. I'd rather not.
Wait! Where are you going?
Well, I have to go and get changed.
- What about me?
- What about you? You'll be fine.
It just takes a little while for the effect to wear off, OK?
Well?
I'm in love.
- It's great, isn't it?
- The best.
You know, I'll tell you, Wyatt,
I think things are turning around for us.
I mean it.
OK, what about Lisa?
Well, I think we're gonna have to have a talk with her.
Think she'll understand?
I think so. I mean, uh...
I sure as hell wouldn't want to date you.
You're not my type, you know.
Chet?
Chet?
Hi, dudes!
I'm sorry, Wyatt.
I'm sorry for being such a shit to you all these years.
And, gee, well,
I want you to know that...
...I love you.
That's nasty, Wyatt.
That's Chet, Gary.
Hey, hey, huh...
Hmm!
Oh, my God!
Lisa?
In here!
- Lisa?
- Yeah?
- You saw Chet?
- Yes, I did.
You responsible?
Yes, I am.
Lisa, we can't have him like that.
It'd ruin Christmas.
Listen, he's gonna be fine in half an hour.
He's not going to spoil Christmas.
And he's not going to bug you anymore, either.
Um...
Lisa, we have to have a talk with you.
What's on your mind?
I really don't know how to say this to you.
You guys found girlfriends, right?
Fell in love with the two girls, and they fell in love with you.
That's all I ever wanted for you.
You're not hurt?
Yeah, sure I'm hurt.
But I wouldn't change it.
I'm really just getting off seeing you two guys straightened out.
I have to go.
Oh...
I've had a wonderful time.
Lisa...
Bye.
Boys?
We're home!
- Hi, Mr. Donnelly. How are you?
- Hi, honey.
- Dad, hi.
- No, no, no, no. Like a man.
So, what did you guys do this weekend?
- Not much.
- Just hung around the house, you know.
Daddy had this crazy notion you guys might throw a party or do something nutty.
- Ha-ha!
- Shit.
- Not us.
- Not here.
No way.
Shh, shh!
OK... drop and give me twenty.

Can't you sleep?
It's past 1:00 in the morning, Dorothy.
- Aunt Em?
- What, precious?
I wish I could put my head on my paws and go to sleep like Toto.
Soon you will.
I just can't see payin' out money for this doctor when we don't have any.
Garnet said she'd loan it to us.
Garnet. That's charity, Em.
She's my sister.
It's family, not charity.
It's been six months since the tornado, and Dorothy hasn't been herself since.
I'm takin' her to Cottonwood Falls tomorrow and see if she can be helped.
All she ever talks about is someplace that just doesn't exist.
Talkin' tin men, walkin' scarecrows, ruby slippers.
A shooting star, Toto.
A shooting star.
Toto, no! No, Toto!
Did you lay an egg this morning, Billina?
Let's go see.
Where's your egg, Billina?
Billina, if you don't start laying again,
Aunt Em says she's gonna stew you up for supper.
It's a key, Toto.
"O... Z."
Oz.
Aunt Em!
Aunt Em, look! A key from Oz!
It's just a key to the old house before the tornado.
- I must've turned it a thousand times.
- No, look, Aunt Em.
It's proof. "O-Z." Oz.
- Dorothy...
- My friends sent it on a shooting star.
Remember how we spoke?
Not to talk about Oz?
Why?
'Cause it's just my imagination.
I know you don't want to go to the doctor's.
But you just haven't slept the night right through since the tornado.
And then, you're no help to me in the morning.
Aunt Em, my friends are in trouble.
- I know it!
- We are in trouble, Dorothy.
Lost the old house in the tornado.
Never before had to have a mortgage, now we may have to have two.
Winter's comin' on.
New house isn't finished.
He broke his leg, Aunt Em.
Dorothy, that leg's mended. It's mended.
Hurry up and get yourself ready.
We're going to be late.
Bye, Uncle Henry!
Y'all get yourselves back here by dark!
We will!
Come on, giddap! There you go.
Go home, Toto.
Toto, go home!
Go home!
Aunt Em, will he be all right?
He will.
Go home!
Giddap.
I've never been past Franklin before.
The tin woodsman used to be made of flesh, like everybody else, but then he cut off his leg.
He had a tin leg made, but then a witch enchanted his ax, and he kept on cutting off the other parts of his body, until he was all made of tin.
- Even his head was...
- That's all right, Dorothy.
You mentioned something about a tiger.
A lion. A cowardly lion.
And he could talk too, like the scarecrow and the tin man?
Yes, all the animals in Oz could talk.
Just how did you get back from Oz?
With my ruby slippers.
And exactly... how did that work?
You put them on and you click the heels three times, and then you said,
"There's no place like home."
Dorothy, where are those slippers now?
Dorothy?
I lost them.
They fell off on the way back.
Well, I think I know just the thing to cheer Dorothy up.
This electrical marvel will make it possible for you to sleep again.
And it will also get rid of all those bad waking dreams that you've been telling me about.
Now, this fellow here has a face.
Do you see it?
Here are his eyes, and this must be his nose, and this must be his mouth.
But what's this? Dorothy?
Why, it's his tongue!
Isn't it?
- Will it hurt?
- No, no!
It just manages electrical current.
Now, your aunt already knows that we are at the dawn of a new age.
In just two months, it will be the year 1900.
A new century. The 20th century.
A century of electricity.
The brain itself is an electrical machine.
It's nothing but a machine.
When it malfunctions, a blow to the head, for example, then the brain produces useless excess currents.
These excess currents are our dreams and delusions.
And we have found out that sometimes the brain malfunctions.
Just like the dreams that you have, Dorothy.
Now we have the means to control these excess currents.
Yes.
Fine.
I must get back to Henry before nightfall.
You understand, don't you?
Here's your lunch pail. I was thinking we'd only stay a short time.
That won't be necessary.
We have excellent meals here.
Now, be a good girl, and do everything the doctor and the head nurse tell you, and I'll be back tomorrow and we'll go home!
I've never left her out of my sight among strangers.
She's in good hands.
Will you bring Toto when you come to get me?
I will. Yes, of course I will.
You won't need that!
You stay here until we come and get you.
You may have a nap if you wish.
Come on, giddap!
Come on!
Aunt Em.
This is for you.
Thank you.
- It's Halloween soon.
- I know.
Why did they bring you here, Dorothy?
Because I can't sleep.
And I talk about a place that I've been to, but nobody believes it exists.
I have to go. I'll come back later.
Would you like to go for a ride, Dorothy?
- Lie down.
- I'd like to sit up if I may.
- What did your aunt tell you?
- To do what you told me, Miss Wilson.
Then lie down.
Why do you have to tie me down?
So that you don't fall off.
I came all the way from the farm in the buggy and didn't fall off.
- Did I hear somebody screaming there?
- No.
Hello, Dorothy. How are you?
I wish I wasn't tied down.
Nothing to worry about.
What are those?
Oh.
We'll just put them over your ears.
Pretty soon they'll draw all those unpleasant dreams out of your head.
Then, when you wake up, you'll never be bothered by them again.
Testing. On.
Off.
Well, I think we're almost ready.
- Ready?
- Yes, Doctor.
Oh, dear.
I'll see to that.
You check the generator.
- Who's there?
- Quick! We have to get you out of here.
What's that screaming?
Patients who have been damaged, locked in the cellar.
Quick!
Get back!
In here, quick!
So!
Run, Dorothy, run!
Come on!
Faster, Dorothy! Faster!
Stop!
Stop!
- Dorothy!
- Here, grab my hand!
Dorothy!
Jump!
Stop!
Here, Dorothy, here!
Hold on!
What's that?
I was just tryin' to lay my egg, that's all.
Billina?
Who else?
What are you doing here?
Have you been here all night too?
I've never been so wet in my whole life.
How big is this pond anyway?
I don't think it's a pond, Billina.
- I guess it is a pond.
- Told you so.
Where did all the rest of the water go?
Where did Kansas go?
This is some place for a chicken coop.
When did you learn to talk? I thought hens could only cluck and cackle.
Strange, ain't it? How's my grammar?
If we were in the Land of Oz, your talking wouldn't be strange at all.
There goes the water.
High and dry.
Oz.
- Maybe this is Oz!
- Oz?
Well, I think I'll have a look around and see if I can find myself some breakfast.
Wait!
If this is the Land of Oz, then this is the Deadly Desert.
Deadly Desert?
It surrounds Oz. Last time
I flew over it in the old house.
Anything living that touches it turns to sand.
Just my luck.
If we stay on these stones, we'll be all right.
Careful.
Careful.
One, two, three!
There.
- Now, let's find something for breakfast.
- It's about time.
Then we can go on to the Emerald City and see my friend the Scarecrow.
- Scarecrow?
- He's the King of Oz, Billina.
Look, Billina. It's a lunch pail tree.
What happened to breakfast?
Now I know we're in Oz.
Now, make sure you don't pick a green one.
There's some ripe ones.
This one for now, and this other one for later.
Come share my lunch with me, Billina.
Just a minute.
Nice couple of worms here.
I wonder what's inside.
And a ham sandwich?
I'm glad it's not fried chicken.
Oh, Billina, we're back in Oz!
Now I can show you all the people and things that nobody would believe in.
Your Majesty, she has returned to Oz.
Good. Keep an eye on her.
What's the matter? What is it?
She has a chicken with her!
A chicken!
Where are all your friends?
Where is everybody?
I don't know, Billina. Oz is pretty big.
I don't like it. Makes me nervous.
Billina, this is our old house!
The one the tornado blew away!
- This is how I got to Oz the first time.
- Looks like it was a rough trip.
Billina, this used to be my bedroom.
And in there was the kitchen.
That's where we landed on the Wicked Witch of the East.
- Wicked Witch?
- But where are all the Munchkins?
What are you on about, my dear?
Oh, no.
- Oh, no!
- It's just a yellow brick.
No, Billina, you don't understand.
This was the Yellow Brick Road.
It leads to the Emerald City!
Dorothy!
Wait for me!
Oh, no! What's happened?
Your Majesty, they have discovered the Yellow Brick Road and are on their way to the Emerald City.
Good. They won't get past Mombi.
Well, Billina, that was the Emerald City.
- Not moving very fast, are they?
- They've all been turned to stone.
All this way to see a bunch of stiffs.
- What's a Wheeler?
- I don't remember them.
Look, these ones have lost their heads.
That's what I call just plain carelessness.
Billina!
Dorothy, look out!
It's the Tin Woodsman.
Oh, Tin Woodsman, what happened to you?
What's happened to everybody?
Oh, Cowardly Lion!
Oh, Cowardly Lion, what's happened to you?
Come here, chicken!
A Wheeler!
Billina! Billina!
Over here, Dorothy!
Quick! That way!
We've got you. You're trapped!
Chicken!
The key!
Get her!
You have to come out sooner or later.
When you do, we'll tear you into little pieces and throw you in the Deadly Desert!
I haven't done anything to you!
Isn't that a stolen lunch pail in your hand?
Isn't that a chicken in there with you?
Chicken!
The Nome King doesn't allow chickens anywhere in Oz!
- Who's the Nome King?
- "Who is the Nome King?"
"Who is the Nome King?"
Well, what are we going to do now, Dorothy?
What is it?
I don't know.
"The Royal Army of Oz."
Army? It's just a bunch of old junk, like the copper kettle in the yard back home.
Look! Billina, some directions.
"For thinking, wind number one under left arm.
"For speaking, wind number two under right arm.
"For walking and action, wind number three, middle of back.
"Guaranteed to work perfectly for 1,000 years."
You don't believe that, do you?
I don't know.
I'll wind him up and we'll see.
I'll wind up his thinking first.
I wonder what he's thinkin' about.
I'll wind up his speech, and maybe he can tell us.
Maybe he can tell us what happened to the Emerald City.
- Good morning, little girl.
- Good morning, sir.
Are you Dorothy Gale?
- Yes, sir.
- Pleased to meet you.
I am Tik-Tok, the Royal Army of Oz.
His Majesty, the Scarecrow, locked me in here and told me to wait for you.
What happened to the Emerald City?
Where is the Scarecrow?
I do not know. Suddenly everything living began to turn to stone.
When you did not arrive,
I called for help until my voice ran down.
Then I paced back and forth until my action ran down.
Then I stood and thought until my thought ran down.
After that, I remember nothing until you wound me up. Thank you.
You're welcome.
It was Billina who found the key.
- Billina?
- Over here.
Good morning, Mrs. Hen. Where did you find the key for this place?
- Over near the hog trough.
- Hog trough?
- In Kansas.
- Kansas?
The Scarecrow must have sent it to you somehow.
If you don't mind, Mr. Tok,
I'll wind up your action.
That would please me very much.
And you may call me Tik-Tok.
Why weren't you turned to stone just like everybody else?
Because I am not alive and never will be, thank goodness.
Well, Tik-Tok, the first thing we have to do is to escape from the Wheelers.
They're outside, and said they're going to throw us into the Deadly Desert.
From now on, I will be your obedient servant.
If you keep me wound up.
Make sure my think-works are extra tight, and I will formulate a plan.
Lunch pail.
These Wheelers can be tricky customers.
Oh, my goodness.
You run up the stairs.
I will take care of them.
Come here!
You'll be sorry for treating me like this!
I'm a terrible person!
I am only a machine, so I cannot be sorry or happy, no matter what happens.
Where's the Scarecrow?
What's happened to the Emerald City?
Answer her!
- Answer her!
- The Nome King!
He conquered the Emerald City.
He took all the emeralds.
- He turned everyone to stone.
- What about the Scarecrow?
There's only one person that knows where the Scarecrow is.
And that's Princess M... M... Mom...
- Princess Mombi!
- Princess Mombi?
- I don't remember her.
- Take us to Mombi.
No! No! No!
Please, let me go.
Please! Please let me go.
Please let me go! Let me go!
- All right, Tik-Tok. Let him go.
- Behave yourself, now.
I will behave. I'll behave!
Behave!
I'll be...
You behave!
Hello?
What a mess!
Come on, Tik-Tok.
This Mombi is some housekeeper.
I think it is up these stairs, Dorothy.
Excuse me, miss, but are you Princess Mombi?
Help me to rise.
I think I'll put on something more appropriate.
Come with me.
Your friends can stay here.
We're really looking for the Scarecrow.
I think number four will do for this afternoon.
What do you think?
I think you're very beautiful.
I should hope so.
And just who might you be?
What are you doing here?
I'm Dorothy Gale.
Dorothy Gale?
What's happened to the Scarecrow?
Come nearer to me.
The Nome King took the Scarecrow and all the emeralds back to his mountain.
And turned everyone else to stone.
You will be rather attractive one day.
Not at all beautiful, you understand, but you have a certain prettiness.
Different from my other heads.
I believe I'll lock you in the tower for a few years till your head is ready.
- And then I'll take it.
- I believe you will not!
Tik-Tok!
Billina!
I am coming, Dorothy.
Do not worry. I will save you.
You, I'll have fried for breakfast!
- Tik-Tok, help me!
- Stop!
Oh, dear. My action has run down.
This is too bad.
My fight with the Wheelers made me run down faster than usual.
It can't be helped, Tik-Tok.
What will you do with Tik-Tok?
People will think I have a new statue.
Ha.
The Nome King's mountain.
If this is Oz, Dorothy, I'd rather take my chances back in Kansas.
- Billina...
- What?
- If only we could just fly away, like you.
- Only in my younger days, my dear.
Mom?
Mom?
Mom, is that you?
No.
- I'm Dorothy Gale.
- Oh.
For a second there,
I thought my mom had come back.
What is this, a man or a melon?
A pumpkin, if you please.
My name's Jack.
Jack Pumpkinhead.
May I ask a favor of you, Dorothy?
Would you please check my head for signs of spoiling?
Any soft spots?
- How does it feel?
- Very nice, sir.
Thank you.
I've been alive such a short while, and I'm afraid of spoiling before I've seen anything of the world.
Could you put some of the rest of me together again?
If you can just tie that arm on.
And then, my other leg has fallen off too.
Are you sure you're not my mom?
I'm sure, Jack.
Well, my mother built me to scare that awful witch, Mombi.
She stood me in a place where
Mombi would meet me, face-to-face.
And along she came.
Sure enough, she was scared.
But then, she was angry.
She has a terrible temper.
I know.
Where did she get all those different heads?
Did you see the headless dancing girls outside?
Well, that's where she got them.
Anyway, Mombi was about to destroy me with her stick.
But she decided to test some powder of life she'd just bought from a magician.
She did.
It worked.
Here I am!
Powder of life?
You sprinkle it on something and the thing comes to life.
Does Mombi have any more of it?
If she does, it's in cabinet 31, with her original head.
What happened to your mother?
She vanished. Mombi enchanted her.
After that, she threw me in this corner and said she was gonna make a pie out of me.
But she was wearing head 22 at the time and must not have worn it since, because she hasn't remembered
I'm up here.
Jack, Billina, listen!
Here's what we have to do.
Oh!
Is that Tik-Tok?
Dorothy?
Sh.
Oh.
Dorothy, may I call you Mom, even if it isn't so?
Oh!
Thank you.
Tik-Tok, are you listening?
Don't say anything.
This is Jack.
After I'm finished winding you up, go upstairs with him and we'll explain what you have to do.
- Did you understand all that, Tik-Tok?
- I understand it better than you do.
- Good. Go and get the head, Jack.
- Yes, sir!
Billina, where's that cord?
Over here, Billina.
That's it.
What's that?
The head of a Gump.
Here's a broom, Tik-Tok.
It'll make a great tail.
Excellent. Now we must Gump the head in the front and tie Jack's feet together.
Right. Tie my feet together.
Bring that mantelpiece to the desk, and anoint the palms!
Right. Anoint the palm!
That is right, Jack. Left, right, wrong.
What are you talking about?
Little girls, pumpkinheads make chicken fly the coop.
Coop?
Dorothy Gale!
Dorothy Gale!
Dorothy Gale!
Where's my powder of life?
- Mombi's awake!
- Oh, no!
- It's not finished!
- Tik-Tok went berserk!
- Tickle, tickle me!
- His brain's ran down.
If his brain's ran down, how could he talk?
It happens to people all the time, Jack.
Tie the palm leaves to the sofa, quick!
Billina, help him!
- We need another cord!
- Well, hurry!
Thank goodness, Dorothy.
I am all right now.
Go to the door and look out for Mombi.
All right, Dorothy.
Make sure you do the head, so it can see where it's going.
- It's not working!
- There must've been some magic words.
- What were they? Think!
- Think?
You've got to remember!
I wasn't alive then.
How can I remember?
Read the directions, Dorothy!
- I don't know these words!
- Read them anyway.
"Weaugh, teaugh,
"peaugh."
- Peaugh?
- That's it!
Hurry!
I'll stop you!
She is coming!
Jack, go help Tik-Tok get aboard.
Billina, get in!
- Wait for me!
- A chicken?
- Can you flap your wings?
- I don't have any wings.
- Now you do!
- I guess you're right, I do!
- Jump up, Tik-Tok!
- Help me up, Dorothy!
- Easy, is it?
- Dorothy Gale!
So!
- Fly, fly!
- Wait for me.
Jack! Jack!
Stop!
Fly! Fly!
We did it!
- Help me!
- Hold on, Jack!
Here, Jack, give me your hand.
Tik-Tok, will you help me pull?
Wake up! Wake up, all of you! Get up!
Get up! Wake up! Look!
Dorothy Gale is escaping!
Go and get them back for me! Hurry up!
All of you! Go on!
And make sure you bring back that chicken!
Don't come back without them!
The last thing I remember is walking through the forest and hearing a loud noise.
And now, here I am, flying through the air.
What am I anyway?
You're just a thing with a Gump's head on it.
We built you and brought you to life so that you could take us to the Nome King to rescue the Scarecrow.
I may not last very long.
I don't feel too well put together.
Oh, don't say that.
How do we know where to land?
It's awful dark down there.
The Nome King's mountain was straight ahead.
I think.
The best thing to do is to keep flying until dawn.
Then maybe we can find a safe place to land.
Good idea, Tik-Tok.
Mr. Gump? Can you just keep flying straight ahead?
I don't think
I could turn if I wanted to.
Why don't we just fly back to Kansas?
Whatever happens,
I'm awfully sleepy right now.
And I'm just glad I have my own head to be sleepy with.
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Jack.
Ozma.
Nobody's going to help you.
Nobody knows where you are.
There's nobody left who even knows who you are.
- What are they?
- Wheelers.
Mr. Gump, can't you fly any faster?
Not unless one of you wants to jump off.
Oh.
Tik-Tok, you're the heaviest.
Hmph!
Deadly Desert.
Deadly Desert!
We are over the Deadly Desert, Jack.
Mom! Wake up!
What's happening?
- The ropes are breaking.
- Oh, no!
I knew it! We're gonna fall apart.
Are we gonna land now, Mom?
Other side. The rope on the other side.
I'll get it!
Help!
- Help me, Mom!
- Oh, Jack!
Hurry!
Fly down.
Jack's lost his head over the side.
- We'll save you, Jack!
- I wasn't made to make turns.
- Try! You've got to try!
- Well, all right.
Hold on, I'm not sure
I know how to do this.
- Hold on, Tik-Tok!
- I am, Dorothy.
Hold on, Dorothy.
Can you hear me, Jack?
I feel awfully dizzy!
- Thanks, Mom.
- Somebody help me!
I'll save you.
Abandon ship!
If I had a stomach, I know I'd be sick.
I'm sorry, Mom!
It's all right, Jack!
It can't be helped now!
That was a novel experience, wasn't it?
- Pick me up!
- Tik-Tok!
Pick me up. Pick me up.
Pick me up. Pick me up.
Oh, thank you, Dorothy.
Jack, are you all right?
Why are all of you standing on your heads?
Where are we, anyway?
The Nome King's mountain.
The Nome King.
Oh, thank you, Dorothy.
Tik-Tok, you've got to be more careful.
Yes, Your Majesty? You called?
What is that noise going on up there?
I don't know, Your Majesty.
Well, find out!
What about the Gump? He's all in pieces.
And good riddance.
I'm much happier just being a head.
We should tie him back on the sofa.
Then, at least, he could walk.
Oh, no!
Every head must have a body if it expects to get around.
Doesn't look like there's much of anyplace to get around to.
She escaped from Mombi somehow and crossed the Deadly Desert.
Now she is on our mountain with a small army.
She is more powerful than I thought.
What about the chicken?
There's no sign of the chicken.
This is terrible.
Suppose I meet another Gump.
I'd die a second time, of embarrassment.
I don't think you'll have to worry about meeting any other Gumps up here.
Tell me who you are, and why you have come all the way to my kingdom and what I can do to make you happy.
- It must be the Nome King.
- Where is he? I don't see anybody.
My name is Dorothy Gale, Your Majesty.
And these are my friends,
Tik-Tok, Jack and the Gump.
Not the Dorothy Gale from Kansas?
Yes, Your Majesty.
We've come to ask you to release the
Scarecrow and restore the Emerald City.
You believe that I have stolen something, Dorothy, and you want me to give it back?
Yes, Your Majesty.
If someone steals something, you think they should give it back?
Yes, Your Majesty.
And what if they don't want to give it back?
Well, then we are here with our army to conquer you and force you to give it back.
Army?
Mom, why is he laughing?
Army!
An army!
- Look out!
- I am! I am!
- Dorothy!
- Mom!
All the precious stones in the world are made here in my underground dominions.
All made for me by my Nomes.
So, imagine how we feel when someone from the world above digs down and steals my treasures.
All those emeralds in the Emerald City really belong to me.
I was just taking back what was mine to begin with.
- You have so much!
- Beg your pardon?
You have so much!
That is not the point.
I am not the thief.
- Dorothy!
- Scarecrow!
Your friend is the thief.
What's happened to the Scarecrow?
Oh, I transformed him into an ornament.
Into an amusing and beautiful ornament for my palace.
I had been planning to do it for some time, and your coming here reminded me.
Thank you.
He never stole anything!
They were there when he came!
He never stole the emeralds.
They were there when he came.
He...
The emeralds... He never stole.
No, no. Don't cry.
Poor, poor Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
I didn't realize he meant so much to you.
He didn't steal the emeralds. They were there when he became king.
All's not lost, Dorothy.
I know just the thing to cheer you up.
You and your friends can play a little game, and I bet that you get the Scarecrow back after all.
You'd risk something for that, wouldn't you?
All right, then, where's Dorothy?
Where's the chicken?
- They escaped.
- They went that way.
She went into the Nome King's mountain!
We have to warn him about that chicken!
Take me to the Nome King, you stupid idiots.
You can go and inspect my ornament collection.
Each of you has three chances to guess which one is the Scarecrow.
If you touch the right object and say the word "Oz" at the same time, the Scarecrow will be restored and you may leave the palace.
Sound fair enough?
What else can we do?
He's a very powerful magician.
We're lucky he hasn't turned us to stone.
All right, we accept.
Oh, good!
Why doesn't the sofa go first?
But I don't have anything to touch with.
You can use your antlers.
I should've quit when I was ahead.
Good luck, Mr. Gump.
Shall we have some refreshment while we wait?
- How is it?
- Good.
What is it?
Limestone pie and hot melted silver.
Melted silver?
The King mentioned a risk.
What is it that we are risking?
What was that?
Next.
- Pick me up.
- I'm coming, Tik-Tok.
Pick me up. Pick me up.
- Thank you.
- Where's the Gump?
- He's turned into an ornament.
- What do you mean?
An ornament. A knickknack.
He failed to guess correctly, and so now he's become part of my collection.
- Oh, no!
- But that's not fair!
You said you were willing to take a risk.
It sounds fair to me, and what I think is all that matters.
But you didn't tell us about it.
Well, you didn't ask.
Perhaps you'd like to visit my fiery furnace!
Next!
- Pumpkinhead.
- Me?
Being an ornament will probably be hardest on you, Dorothy, since you're used to eating and sleeping and other such activities.
Since I never eat or sleep,
I won't miss them.
Don't talk that way, Jack.
We won't become ornaments.
Tik-Tok's not even alive.
I have always valued my lifelessness.
Be careful, Jack.
You too, Billina.
We're a long way from Kansas, Dorothy.
Faster! Faster!
Faster! Faster, faster!
You hear me? Faster! Faster!
You miserable, slow wretches!
I do not hold out much hope for Jack.
He has many excellent qualities, but thinking is not one of them.
Maybe he'll be lucky.
Two guesses left.
- You need winding?
- My think-works could be tighter.
It's too bad they didn't make you so you could wind yourself up.
Half the trouble you get into comes from winding down.
Faster! Faster!
Faster!
Next, the Army of Oz!
Do not worry, Dorothy.
I am going to guess correctly.
Why did you come here?
I told you why.
You came all this way for a scarecrow?
Are you sure you didn't come back for these?
- My ruby slippers!
- No. No.
No. My ruby slippers.
They just fell out of the sky one day.
You were so anxious to get home.
They're very powerful.
They made it possible for me to conquer the Emerald City.
Thank you.
The Army of Oz has stopped guessing and is standing perfectly still in the middle of the room.
Your army has stopped guessing and is standing perfectly still in the middle of the room.
His action must have run down.
I wound up his thought, but I forgot to do his action.
Why don't you go in and wind him up?
Then you can stay in and guess for yourself.
Dorothy.
You don't have to go down there.
I can use the ruby slippers and send you home.
And when you get back, you will never think of Oz again.
What about my friends?
Forget about them.
You can't help them now.
There's no place like home.
Tik-Tok!
Tik-Tok? Tik-Tok!
Tik-Tok, you're all wound up.
What's the matter? Why did you stop?
It was my way of getting you in here.
Pretend that you are winding me up anyway.
I have an idea that may save us.
I have one guess left, and if I guess incorrectly, you can watch and see what I am changed into.
That may give you a clue.
What a good idea!
My steel brains must be damaged because I am having difficulty guessing.
Tik-Tok.
Don't cry.
Ready?
Oz.
Tik-Tok.
Tik-Tok?
Dorothy Gale, you're all that's left.
Stop!
Open up! Tell him it's important!
Oz.
Kneel.
Lower.
Lower!
Oz.
One guess left.
Dorothy Gale has come back.
Yes, I know. You were supposed to bring her to me.
She stole my ruby key, my powder of life and valuable antiques which she made into a flying sofa, and she's headed this way.
You know.
I know everything.
She's already here, but not for much longer.
Why didn't you just transform them all right away?
It's more fun this way.
But if she guesses right and finds out about Ozma...
Ozma?
You haven't let her escape as well?
No. No.
Then there's nothing to worry about.
Soon there'll be no one left who remembers Oz, and I will be completely human.
Oz.
Dorothy!
Smudge and blazes!
- Scarecrow!
- Dorothy.
- You were green.
- What?
- You were a green ornament.
- I was?
Maybe people from Oz turn into green ornaments.
Fumes and furnaces!
Green. Green, green, green.
Green. It's green!
You let her escape!
It's green, Dorothy. Green.
Oz!
Oh, it's you! The Gump!
Petrified polymorphs!
Look for green ornaments, quick.
We've still got Tik-Tok, Jack and Billina to find.
You had her and you let her escape!
It wasn't my fault!
If you'd given me a real army...
I'll take care of you later!
What? Oh, no!
Oh, Wheelers. Help me!
Dorothy!
- What's happening?
- I was gonna ask you the same thing.
Whoa!
- Scarecrow!
- Dorothy!
Hang on, Dorothy.
Stop!
Dorothy! Dorothy!
It's green!
- Stop!
- Oz!
- Jack!
- Oh, Mom! Where am I?
What's happening? Who's that?
Stop!
We haven't finished guessing yet.
- You promised if we guessed correctly...
- I'm tired of games.
I'm tired of all of you!
Why doesn't the sofa go first?
No! No! No!
Come on! Pull!
Next, Pumpkinhead!
- No!
- Run!
Run! Hurry!
Faster!
Nomes!
Back! Go back!
This way!
Quick, run away!
Come on! Scarecrow!
Mom!
No!
No!
Oh, dear!
Billina.
Oh, no! Oh, dear!
Mom!
An egg?
- Poison.
- Poison.
- Poison.
- Poison.
- Poison.
- Poison.
Oh, put me down.
Oh, Mom!
Mom! Look out! Look out!
I finally laid my egg!
Oh, my head!
Don't you know that eggs are poison?
Poison, indeed!
Poison.
Poison to Nomes!
- Hurry, Dorothy!
- I am! I am!
What are we gonna do now?
I wish all of us from Oz to return there safely, and for the Emerald City and all the people in it to be restored to life!
I must say, this life is stranger than my last one.
Where's Tik-Tok?
We never found him.
- Oh, no.
- Where'd you get that?
There's a medal on your antler.
That must've come from the ornament collection.
Go on. Touch it, Dorothy.
Oz!
Oh, Dorothy. My thinking must have completely run down.
I do not remember leaving the Nome Kingdom.
Everything's all right now.
Hi. Hi.
Be the Queen of Oz, Dorothy.
Be the Queen of Oz!
- Be the Queen of Oz!
- The Queen of Oz!
The Queen of Oz!
Be the Queen of Oz!
You're the best friends anyone's ever had.
I've got to go back.
We understand, Dorothy.
Do you?
I wish I could be in both places at the same time.
Look! Behind you, in the mirror!
It's you.
I was afraid you had drowned.
Help me step through the glass, Dorothy.
You're so beautiful.
- What's your name?
- Ozma.
Mom! My real mom.
She is Ozma,
Queen and rightful ruler of Oz!
Her father was King of Oz before the Wizard came.
Ozma grew up as Mombi's slave.
When the Nome King promised Mombi
30 beautiful heads if she kept Ozma a secret, she enchanted her into the mirror.
I forgive Mombi.
Dorothy has punished her by removing her magical powers, and a witch with no magic is a miserable creature indeed.
And that's a fact.
Now, please, wish me back to Kansas.
On one condition.
I will look in on you from time to time, and if you ever wish to return to Oz,
I will make it so.
Goodbye, Dorothy.
You're not coming back, Billina?
No. Not to that stupid, humdrum world again.
Goodbye, Dorothy.
Oh, no. I mean, I didn't expect to go so soon.
I haven't really said goodbye yet.
Goodbye, Cowardly Lion.
- Goodbye, Dorothy.
- Tik-Tok.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Dorothy.
I'll never forget any of you.
Give my love to all the chickens.
- Dorothy...
- I love you so much.
- Farewell!
- Goodbye, Dorothy.
Farewell, Dorothy!
- It's so bright.
- Goodbye, Dorothy.
- Goodbye, Dorothy.
- I love you all! Goodbye!
- Goodbye.
- Bye, Dorothy.
Goodbye! Goodbye!
Goodbye. Bye.
Goodbye.
Toto?
Toto!
Toto!
Toto! Toto!
Dorothy?
Dorothy?
Dorothy!
Oh, are you all right?
Toto found me.
I'd almost given up hope.
Up you go, sweetheart.
It's Dorothy!
The clinic was hit by lightning and it burned to the ground.
Everybody was rescued except Dr. Worley.
He ran in to rescue his machines.
Mornin', all.
Hi, hon.
Ozma.
Aunt Em, come and look!
What is it, darling? I'm busy.
Nothing. Just a reflection.
What is it, Dorothy?
It's nice to have a room of your own, isn't it?
Put the mirror straight, sweetheart.
Come on, you two.
It's too nice a day to stay inside.
Come on, Toto.
Toto, come on!
Good dog!
MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO

Let's go walkin', you and me

Thanks.
Daddy, want any caramel candy?
Thank you. I would. Anybody tired yet?
Mm-mmm.
We're almost there.
Good.
Ohh!
Mai, hide.
I thought he was a policeman.
Hi!
Hi!
Hello there!
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
Sorry to bother you, but are your parents around anywhere?
They're out there in the field.
Thanks a lot.
Hello there!
Looks like we're going to be neighbors!
Pleasure to meet you.
Good luck in the new house!
Thank you! See you soon!
Oh!
Thank you very much.
Everybody out.
Uhh! Ohh!
Hey!
Hang on.
There.
Hey, Mai, come over here a minute.
Wow!
What are those little things swimming around?
l don't know.
Goldfish maybe or something?
So do you like it?
It's terrific!
Uh-huh.
Come on, Mai, run!
Wait up!
Wow!
- Can we?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh!
Ha ha ha!
You be careful, O. K.?
Oh, sure. Hee hee hee!
Ha ha ha!
- Oh!
- Oh!
Ohh!
What a lot of neat old junk.
Do you think it's haunted?
Ohh, maybe it is.
Oh, boy!
I bet I can beat you around the house!
Wait!
[Imitating airplane]
Ooh! Oh!
Ooh.
Ohh!
It's completely rotten.
Uh-oh, it's gonna fall down
- Ha ha ha!
- Hee hee!
Uhh! Uhh!
Oh! Hee hee!
Ooh!
Oh!
Hee hee! Aah!
Ha ha ha!
Hee hee hee!
Ha ha ha!
[Indian war whoops]
Hey!
Ohh! Whee!
Whoo! Ha ha!
Ha ha ha! Ohh!
Wow, Mai, look up!
What?
Up there. Look.
Wow, what a tree.
It's giant!
That's got to be the biggest tree in -
Ah-choo!
Ha ha ha!
Daddy, look at that big tree on the mountain!
That s a camphor tree.
Camphor.
Camphor tree!
Camphor tree!
Camphor!
Oh.
Uhh! Oh!
Hey, Mai. . .
Look, an acorn.
Huh?
But I want a acorn, too.
Oh, hey, wait a second.
There's some more over there.
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!
I have my own acorn right here.
Huh?
Mai, how am I supposed to open the house up
if you're in the way?
Acorns!
I found a bunch near the back door.
They came from way up.
They came out of the ceiling.
Hmm. Some squirrels must have dropped them.
- Ohh! Squirrels!
- Ohh! Squirrels!
Or maybe some other animal, perhaps a rat.
But I don't want a dumb rat!
Where am I going to put it?
Just bring it here.
I'll open it up for you.
Satsuki, open the kitchen door.
Here you go.
Mai, come on.
Hey!
[Imitating airplane]
Wait!
Hey, wait up!
You can't catch me
Can, too.
[Whoosh] hh!
Oh.
- Aah!
- Aah!
Hmm.
Ready?
Mm-hmm.
Bathtubs.
Great.
Nothing up there.
No.
- Ohh!
- Ohh!
Bathtubs are in there.
We saw something move in there.
A squirrel?
We're not sure.
Maybe they were cockroaches, but there were millions of them.
Hmm.
Lots of little black things.
See anything?
Well, I'm pretty sure they were dust bunnies.
Real dust bunnies, like in my picture book?
Dust bunnies make more sense than ghosts.
Why?
Uhh!
Ghosts are harder to see.
When you suddenly move from a lighted room to darkness,
you can't see for a second.
That's when dust bunnies come out.
Boy. Yeah.
Come out! Come out!
- Come out!
- Come on out!
Come out! Come out!
Come out! Come out!
Come out, dust bunnies!
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
Let's get to work.
We have to find the steps that lead up to the attic.
What?
Find the way up.
We'll open all the windows upstairs.
Yeah!
Hey, wait for me.
Ha ha.
No stairs.
No.
Nothing here.
Nothing here.
Nope. Nothing there.
Ha ha ha!
Nothing there.
Hee hee hee!
Ow.
Nobody in this room.
Nobody here!
- Hi!
- Ha ha ha!
Hey!
Ha ha ha!
Ohh!
Come here, Mai! I found it!
Hee hee hee!
Wow.
Someone up there?
Catch some ghosts upstairs?
- Ohh!
- Ohh!
It's an acorn.
Uh-oh.
Uhh!
They must like them.
Little dust bunnies, go away right now!
Oh.
Heh heh heh.
Hmm.
- Aah!
- Aah!
Aah.
Don't be scared, Mai.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
There's nobody here.
[Whoosh]
- Ohh!
- Ohh!
Aah!
Oh.
[Whoosh]
Ohh!
There.
That's it. Easy.
Slowly.
Guess what.
Something's really living upstairs after all!
That's wonderful. Good for you.
I've always wanted to have a haunted house.
It's been my lifelong dream.
Uhh!
Careful!
Oh!
[Crash]
Ooh!
Aah!
[Whoosh]
Guess what, Sis! I got one!
Uhh!
Eh?
Aah!
Mai?
Oh.
Aah!
Huh!
Whoo whoo!
Ah! Ah! Ah.
Two fine kids.
There's nothing to be frightened about.
Nanny has the farm next door.
She's helping us out.
Nanny, this is Mai, my sister,
and I'm Satsuki.
Very pleased to meet both of you.
lf I'd known what a hurry you were in to move,
I would've cleaned the house up.
It really isn't necessary.
Aah!
I've been so busy in the rice paddies lately. . .
How did you get all that black on you?
I had a dust bunny right in my hand.
Ohh! Mai, your feet!
Uh-oh.
To do a little dusting. . .
You got mine black, too!
Eh?
Aha!
It appears the soot sprites are hard at work.
What are they?
You mean those black little fuzzy things that fly around and disappear upstairs?
Yes. They breed in very old empty houses, building invisible nests and turning everything into dust.
l could see them, too, when I was a very small child.
That you two are able to see them makes me very glad.
It couldn't have been a spirit, could it?
If they're not sprites, then you have nothing to be frightened about. lf we keep smiling, the sprites may gradually go away and leave this place alone.
Yes. I'm sure that somewhere up in that ceiling they're busily discussing plans for leaving the house.
[Chattering]
Maybe they really will leave us alone.
What's wrong with them?
With dust bunnies all over the house?
I'm not afraid of dust bunnies.
Maybe you can go to the bathroom by yourself at night.
Ha ha ha!
Come. The house needs cleaning up.
Fetch a bucket and go get some water.
From the stream?
Maybe we'll catch a fish!
- Ha ha ha!
- Hee hee hee!
You wait here, O. K.?
Did you get any fish?
Ha ha!
It's coming out!
It's coming out, Nanny!
Good. Very good.
Just keep at it till the water gets cold.
Right.
Ha!
Ha!
Oh.
Huh!
Hey, is that for us?
Is that for me?
Tell me what your name is.
Uh, it's for Grandma.
Huh?
Grandma?
Yuh-uh-uh.
Hmm?
Mmm!
Yuh-uh!
Hey, wait up! Where you going?
Kanta, don't be silly.
Hey, haven't you heard?
You re living in a haunted house!
- Ohh!
- Go away!
Yuh-uh!
[Sniffs]
Ehhhh!
Ha ha ha! l remember doing that when I was his age. l hate boys, but I love Nanny's food better than anything else in the whole wide world.
Eat all you want.
Thanks for your help!
Bye!
Thank you so much, Nanny.
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!
[Wind howling]
Aah! Oh!
[Wind howling]
I'm scared the wind's going to make the house fall down.
Maybe it will, but I hope not because we just moved in.
Huh?
[Crash]
- Hmm?
- Ohh!
Aah!
- Ha ha ha!
- Ohh!
Come on. What are you waiting for?
You have to laugh loud to scare a spirit.
Ha ha ha!
I'm not scared at all.
Uh huh ha ha.
I'm not! I mean it!
Aah! Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
Aah!
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
That's it. Give it all you got.
Come on. Yeah.
There we go.
Well, if I may humbly say so, we're finished.
- Yay!
- Yay!
Uhh! There we are.
Get ready to fly, Mai!
Better hold on!
- Aah!
- Oh! Oh! Oh!
Here we go!
Nanny!
Hi!
Hello!
Where are you pedaling off to this morning?
We're going to visit Mommy in the hospital!
Well, be sure to give my regards!
I know she'll be very happy to see you!
Bye-bye.
Ehhhh!
Ehhhh!
Nyehhh!
That way, Daddy! That way!
- Ooh. Oh, oh.
- Ha ha ha!
Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
- Ohh!
Hee hee hee!
Mommy!
My love, I'm so happy to see you.
Daddy took the wrong road.
We had to come another way.
Well. Don't be shy.
We got off today from school.
Wonderful.
Daddy said to tell you he'll be here.
He's probably speaking to the doctor.
It's good to see you all.
Do you like the new house?
Yeah.
Ohh! You mean they live upstairs?
Mm-hmm.
Do you like fuzzy spirits, Mommy?
Yes. I wish I could go see them now.
You were right, Mai.
Mm-hmm.
We thought you might not be happy about the house having spooks.
Are you happy with them?
Yep.
I'm not afraid of them.
Don't tell me you fixed Mai's ponytails by yourself.
Mm-hmm.
They're beautiful.
You know, you're a very lucky girl.
She always gets mad at me.
That's because you re always jumping around.
Satsuki, come here.
Why don't you let me brush your hair?
I'm glad it's short.
I want mine short.
When you re my age.
Satsuki, you have wire for hair, as stubborn as mine when I was small.
I'll be able to have hair as beautiful as yours
when I'm older, right?
Yes. I know that because you look exactly like me when I was young.
Hi.
Da da da-da da da
Da da da-duh
Da da da-da da da da-da
Da da-duh. . .
I thought Mommy looked a lot better. l think the doctor might let her leave shortly.
Does that mean tomorrow, Daddy?
Aw, tomorrow means tomorrow.
Maybe not tomorrow, but it's pretty soon.
She said when she comes, she'll only sleep in my bed.
You said you were big enough to sleep by yourself.
Mommy told me it would be O. K.
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
Da da da-duh
La la la la
Daddy!
Daddy, wake up!
It's morning!
Ohh.
Daddy, get up.
Uhh!
It's Mai!
Hee hee hee!
Good morning.
I must have overslept.
We get our lunch boxes today.
I'm sorry. I completely forgot.
I made lunch for everybody.
Hey, it's burning.
Just a minute!
O. K. , this one's for you.
That one's mine.
Mai, stop that. Sit down and eat.
Go ahead. Wrap it yourself.
[Sniffing]
Ahh.
Hey!
You're late!
Must be time to go.
O. K.!
l can't believe you've made a friend already.
Bet you sit next to her in class.
Yep, and her name's Michiko.
Ahh.
Here I come!
- Thanks for saying goodbye!
- Thanks for saying goodbye!
Hi. Sorry.
Why'd you take so long?
We're going to be late.
Ahh. . .
Uhmmm!
Daddy, this hat!
Am I a grownup if I wear it?
It looks that way.
Where are you going?
Going to get some flowers.
Is it lunchtime yet?
I don't think so!
Hmm.
Daddy, look. I'm the flower lady.
Heh heh heh.
Golly, wollypogs.
Hmm.
[Gasp]
There's no bottom.
Huh?
Wow.
Acorn.
Dust bunnies.
Hey.
Huh?
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Come back!
Aha!
Hmm?
Aah!
[Snore]
[Snore]
Hey.
Ah-choo!
Ha!
Hmm?
Hmm.
Tell me who you are.
Are you a big dust bunny?
No.
I'm. . .
[Rahhr]
Waah!
[Giggles]
To. . .
To. . .
Ro!
Totoro?
That's it.
I bet your name's Totoro, isn't it?
[Soft grunt]
So you're really a Totoro.
[Soft grunt]
Totoro.
Sure, I will. Tomorrow.
- O. K. Bye.
- See you later.
Daddy, I'm home.
Already?
Wait. How come you're home so late?
I was playing with Michiko.
Where's Mai?
l haven't even eaten lunch.
I think Mai's out back.
Mai!
Mai!
Mai?
Mai?
Daddy, over here!
I think I know where Mai went.
[Gasp]
Mai?
Mai!
Wake up!
Wake up.
[Moaning]
Wake up, Mai! Right now!
You have no business sleeping in this place.
How come he's gone?
How come who's gone?
Tell me who you lost.
A big Totoro was here with me.
A big one like what's in our picture books?
Mm-hmm.
And I climbed up on top of him,
and he was furry, and he had a big mouth, and there was a little one and one this big and a great big one sleeping by himself.
Uh-huh?
Hello! Is anybody in there?
Well, I'll be.
What a great hiding place.
Daddy, Mai told me she saw a big Totoro.
A real one?
Mm-hmm.
This way.
Ha ha!
Hey, give me a chance.
Here?
Mmm. Mm-hmm.
He was by the big tree a little while ago.
I don't see how he could've escaped.
Mai! Mai, come back!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!
Stop laughing!
I really saw him. I m not lying.
I'm not lying.
Mai.
You don't believe me.
Mm-hmm. That's where you're wrong.
l believe you're being completely truthful about this.
But I also believe that you met the king of the forest.
Meeting him is a sign of good luck.
There's no guarantee you'll see him all the time.
We'll have to pay our respects.
Where do we find him?
Miss Mai will find him for us.
Oh!
Ohh, Mai, you're getting heavier by the minute.
Daddy, the camphor tree.
What a beautiful tree.
I found it.
You sure that's the one?
Uh-huh.
What are you waiting for, Daddy?
Hurry up.
The hole's not there anymore, but I'm sure this is where it was.
You're positive it is?
Mm-hmm.
The opening's completely disappeared.
Remember, you can see him only when he wants you to.
Will we see him? I want to meet him.
You never can tell.
If we're lucky enough.
What a beautiful tree it is.
This tree's been here, well, since before anyone can remember.
You know, a long time ago,
Man and trees were the best of friends.
It's actually because of this tree that I decided to buy our house,
and Mommy will like it, too.
Let's thank the king of the forest and get back for lunch.
I have to meet Michiko after lunch.
I'm coming, too.
Attention!
Thank you for all you've done for Mai.
Please protect her forever.
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.
Last one home's a rotten egg.
No fair! You cheated!
Wait!
Hey!
Hey, wait up!
"Dear Mother,
You're never going to believe this,
but today, under that giant tree,
Mai actually met a ghost, Totoro.
Daddy says it was the king of the forest.
Well, whoever he was,
I really want to meet him."
[Chickens clucking]
[Cluck cluck]
Kanta, you'd better hurry up, or you'll be late.
O. K.
[Whispering]
[Giggling]
There.
Huh?
Mai? What. . .
Excuse me.
Yes, Satsuki?
I-i-it's my sister Mai.
What's she going to do?
Nanny! Nanny, what happened?
Dear, I'm sorry, but she demanded to be with her sister.
But I'm going to be -
Mai, you promised to be a good girl
because Daddy's at the university and can't take care of you.
l have a couple hours left before I can come home, and Nanny's been very nice to watch you.
Our Mai has been a very good girl.
Eh?
Well, I better ask permission for her to come inside.
Because her mother's going to be in the hospital,
Satsuki will be taking care of her sister Mai.
Is that clear?
Yes, ma'am.
What's that a picture of, Mai?
A Totoro picture.
Shh!
Could you be a little more quiet about it?
[Bell rings]
Bye-bye.
Want to come over and play?
I might miss the club meeting.
Come whenever you can.
Bye, Mai.
Goodbye.
We'd better walk fast, or we're going to get wet.
O. K.
Oh, no! Hurry!
Oh!
Oh, my god.
Are you O. K.?
Yeah.
Come on.
Wow. What do we do now?
lf it's not too much trouble, could we stay until it stops raining?
Uh. . .
Thanks.
Uh. . .
Ha ha.
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!
We were pretty lucky, huh?
Ha ha! That's funny.
It's got holes in it.
Uh-oh. Daddy left his umbrella.
Hey, we could bring it back to him.
I just forgot because I forgot.
How can you forget your umbrella
when it's raining?
Even you can't be that stupid.
You probably broke it in half.
I did not!
Hmm?
Y-y-yii!
[Crash]
Excuse me. Is anybody home?
Satsuki, what are you doing here?
Grandma.
Thank you for taking care of Mai.
Don't be ridiculous.
She was a treasure.
We wanted to bring back the umbrella we borrowed.
But - Kanta's umbrella?
Why would he give you this beat-up thing?
We didn't have one, but I'm afraid he got soaking wet.
Anyway, please thank him for us.
l will.
I'm always telling him to wash, so rain did him no harm.
Are you on your way to meet your father?
Yes, ma'am.
Give him my regards.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.
Hee hee hee!
[Imitating airplane]
Did someone come to the door?
I didn't hear anything.
Oh, boy, we made it!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Getting onboard or not?
All right, let's go.
Daddy wasn't on that one, right?
I'm sure he'll be on the next one.
Want to go back to Nanny's house and wait?
[Water dripping]
What's the matter?
Mai, you re sleepy.
Uh-uh.
I told you it might be a while.
You don't want to go to Nanny's and wait?
I'm sure the bus will come soon.
Just hang in there.
Well, I guess they were delayed, but I hope not.
Come on.
[Footsteps]
[Gasp]
Uhhh. . .
I bet you re Totoro.
[Soft grunt]
[Giggles]
Oh, we have another umbrella if you want.
Go ahead. Take it.
Come on. I'm going to drop Mai.
You put it over your head like that.
[Giggling]
[Splat]
[Splat]
[Splat]
[Splash]
[Rahhr]
Aah!
[Rahhr]
Huh?
Huh?
The bus is here.
[Mmreowwr]
- Oh!
- Oh!
[Rahrr]
Mai, wa-wasn't that umbrella he took with him Daddy's?
Thank you.
How nice of you to meet me.
Daddy!
I'm sorry, but the train was late.
That's why I missed the first bus.
You weren't worried, were you? l saw him!
He was right beside me!
Me, too!
Uh. . . uh. . .
Oh, and gigantic arms.
Great big eyeballs, too.
It was scary.
I was scared.
We saw Totoro! We saw Totoro!
We saw Totoro
[Raaar]
[Frogs croaking]
Hey, anyone want a ride?
I do!
O. K. , here we go!
Whee!
"Dear Mother, I'm surprised
I can write to you at all
 'cause my heart is still beating so fast,
Mai and I had something incredible happen today.
We both met Totoro,
I really saw him.
He even gave us a gift.
It was a package wrapped up in bamboo leaves
and tied with dragon whiskers.
We opened it immediately.
Guess what was in it!
Magic nuts and seeds."
- Oh!
- Oh!
Ha ha ha.
"We've decided to plant them all out in the front
because someday they'll be tall and beautiful.
Mai just. . .
sits there every day waiting for them to sprout,
but they don't seem to want to grow.
l can't wait to see what they'll be like.
Mai sends her love and wanted to make sure
you saw her drawing."
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
"It's going to be summer vacation soon,
and we'll be out of school.
l love you, Mother.
Please get well soon."
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
Come on, get off.
That's it! I said get off!
Come on, it's bedtime.
Daddy, will the plants come out?
I mean will they come out tomorrow?
That's tough to say.
Perhaps Totoro will be able to say if they will.
Good night.
Wake up, Mai.
But isn't that where we planted -
Mm-hmm.
Oh! Ow!
Ha ha ha ha!
[Soft grunt]
It worked!
[Loud grunt]
Ah. . .
Ah!
Ah!
Ah! Ah!
Ooh!
Yay!
Yay! We did it!
Yay!
Hee hee!
[Whirring]
Ah. . .
Yay!
Ah!
Ya!
[Rahhrr]
- Aah!
- Aah!
- Aah!
- Aah!
- Aah!
- Now we know what makes the wind blow!
Hmm.
[Whistling]
Huh?
Ha ha ha.
[Tooting]
[Gasp]
What happened to the tree?
[Gasp]
Hey!
We did it! We did it!
Yay!
It was only a dream.
It wasn't a dream.
It was only a dream.
It wasn't a dream!
It was only a dream!
We did it!
We did it!
Telegram!
Hello!
Telegram!
Hello! Anyone home?
Hmm.
Maybe not.
Nanny!
Ha ha ha!
Over here, Mai.
That one's perfect.
Ahh. . .
Hey!
About how ripe is this?
That's ripe.
Wow.
Your vegetable garden is more like a mountain of treasure.
Thanks to Mother Nature.
Let's take a little rest, shall we?
There we are, nice and cold.
Michiko will be jealous.
Mmm.
It's amazing.
They've absorbed lots of wonderful things from the sun.
That's what makes them so good for the body and the soul.
Would they help my mother?
Of course they would.
My vegetable garden is bound to make anyone feel better.
Our mother s coming home this week from the hospital.
She'll sleep with me under my cover.
That's wonderful.
She s able to come back, is she?
She's coming home to spend a couple of days but has to go right back there.
I suppose she has to be careful.
Yes, she has.
We'll fatten her up on my fresh vegetables.
I'm giving Mommy this corn
I picked for her specially.
I'm sure she'll love you for it.
Mm-hmm.
Mailman gave me this telegram because you were out. Here.
But Daddy won't be home from the university till after 9 :OO.
Open it now then.
A telegram is serious business.
Mm-hmm.
It's from my mother's doctor at the hospital.
"Please contact me."
What's that supposed to mean?
Is something wrong or not? l know something awful s happened to her.
What am I supposed to do if my father s not home?
Have you any way of telephoning your father?
I have the number of his research lab, but we don't have a telephone.
Take them to your mother's place.
Let them use the phone.
Do you understand?
Don t panic, but go quickly.
Mai, you make sure you stay put at my house!
Mai!
Mai!
Hey, Mai, don't follow me!
Go to Nanny's house.
Oh.
Hello, Operator.
I'd like to make a long-distance call, please.
It's very important.
It's number 1354 at Station 12.
Yes.
Thank you very much.
Your friend is very pretty.
What lovely hair.
[Ring]
Hello.
Yes.
Can you put me through to the Main lecture room of the Anthropology School?
To Professor Kusakabe.
Please hurry.
Yes, yes.
I'm his daughter.
It was from the hospital, Daddy.
I'm so worried.
Whoa, whoa. Slow down.
From the hospital?
Oh, O. K. It's all right.
I think I understand.
Now, I'm going to call the hospital.
What's happened to Mommy?
There's no need to worry.
I'll check with the hospital and call you right back, O. K.?
Uh-huh.
Stay where you are.
I'm hanging up, so you stay right there.
He'll be calling back.
So is it all right if I stay here by the telephone and wait?
You take all the time you need.
Hey, where are you?
Uh-oh.
[Baa]
[Baa]
Oh, no!
I'm giving this to my Mommy!
[Baa]
Go away!
You just better stop it right now!
[Baa]
Mai, the hospital said that Mommy's condition isn't very good, so she won't be coming home just yet.
But why?
Mai, what can we do?
lf she came home now, it'd make it worse.
It would not!
But she'll be able to come home real soon.
No!
All right then! Be that way!
Let's see if she dies!
No!
Don't be dumb, Mai!
Oh, I give up!
You're so stupid!
Come on, Mai.
Waah!
I'm not stupid!
Waah!
I took care of the rest of the washing.
Come on, now.
It isn't the end of the world.
Your old Nanny's here to help.
Let's see that beautiful smile.
Your father's stopping off at the hospital
on his way home, eh?
What I heard was that your mother only caught a small cold.
She'll be home next weekend,
I believe.
That s what they said last time, too.
"It'll be a little visit,
just a few days to see what's wrong with her.
It's just a cold."
What are me and Mai going to do if Mommy dies?
Uh, uh. . .
What are we going to do, Nanny?
There, there.
Don't worry.
Your mother's not going to die.
Hush.
She'd never leave two such beautiful children.
She loves you too much for that.
Don't cry.
Nanny will stay with you until your father comes home.
Mai!
Where are you?
Mai!
[Cicada chirping]
Mai, come back!
Did you see her anywhere?
No sign at all.
She wasn't at the bus stop?
That's very strange.
Where could she possibly have gone?
Maybe she's angry about this morning.
We had a bad argument and - maybe she went to visit Mommy in the hospital!
The hospital's so far from here.
It's - oh, my heavens!
It would take a grown man three hours to get there.
Hey!
Oh, my goodness.
Please, you must get your father right now.
Tell him little Mai has disappeared.
[Panting]
How could you do something so stupid, Mai?
You always get lost.
Mai!
I'm sorry to bother you, but you haven't seen a little girl, have you?
She's my sister, about 5 years old.
Well, seems to me I remember someone.
Yes, near as I can recall, she went that way.
Maybe she went through the forest.
Then again, she might've gone in the other direction.
Are you sure it was your sister?
All sorts of folks come by here, but I don't see them.
Mai, I'm scared.
Thank you!
Mai!
Please stop!
Aah!
Hey, are you crazy, kid?
I'm looking for my sister.
Have you seen a little girl wandering around?
I'm afraid not.
Mai's her name, and she's 5 years old.
She probably got lost.
We haven't seen anyone, have we?
l think she's going to
Shichikoku Yama.
We just came from there,
but we haven't come across anybody.
Well, thank you.
By the way, where are you from?
Matsugo.
You walked from there to here?
That s three hours away.
Well, good luck, kid.
I hope you find her!
Satsuki, wait!
Come here!
Kanta!
We haven't found her yet.
How about you?
Nothing.
My dad's got everyone searching for her,
so you go home,
and I'll bike to Shichikoku Yama, O. K.?
I'm afraid if she visits Mommy's hospital,
she'll completely lose her -
Somebody found some sandals by the lake.
There's no way she could get past all those people without somebody noticing.
Oh!
Hey, don't worry!
Nobody said they were Mai's sandals!
Did you find her yet?
[Praying]
Go back a bit over towards your right!
Hey, you have any poles left?
There's Satsuki.
Eh?
Look.
Mai!
Mai!
Look, Satsuki.
Is it hers?
It's not hers.
What?
Ohh. . .
Merciful heavens.
You know, Satsuki,
for a while
I thought it might be Mai's.
Mom, I told you you jumped to conclusions.
Forget it! It isn't hers!
So, what do we do now?
We keep on looking, that's what.
Whatever you do, you better hurry up.
It'll be dark soon.
I am grateful to you all.
If you could keep searching -
Don't worry. We understand.
Don't you think we should call the police?
Well, I don't know.
Do you think the police could -
Where are you going?
Totoro,
I beg you, please protect Mai.
She ll be lost and probably scared.
I'll be good for the rest of my life
If I can just see her again.
Oh!
Aah!
What?
Totoro!
Totoro, Mai's lost somewhere.
l looked and looked, but I can't find her anywhere!
Oh, please.
You have to help me find her.
She's probably alone somewhere crying and upset.
Oh, Totoro, I'm scared.
[Soft grunt]
[Rahhr]
[Rahhr]
What?
[Mmreowr]
He wouldn't be able to.
But how come nobody sees the bus?
Oh. . .
Ha ha ha ha!
Oh!
Next stop,
Little Sister.
[Mmreowr]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Mai, where are you?
But how does he make it do that?
[Barking]
Ohh. . .
Mai!
But, Sis, where are you?
Satsuki!
Mai!
There you are!
Satsuki!
Ha ha ha!
Oh, Mai.
I'm sorry.
Tell me one thing.
Were you bringing that corn to the hospital?
Mm-hmm.
[Mmreowr]
[Gasp]
Next stop,
Shichikoku Yama Hospital.
You mean we can go to Mom's hospital?
[Meow]
You're wonderful!
I'm sorry.
It was all because of my silly cold that the hospital sent that telegram.
The grief it must've caused all of you.
I hope you can forgive me.
It was simply a bureaucratic mistake.
I'm sure it wasn't terribly traumatic for either of the girls.
It just means you'll be home next weekend.
They understand.
l wouldn't be at all surprised if they suffered more than we know,
in particular Satsuki because she's so smart and sensitive.
Hmm, could be right.
You'd better be careful after I get home because I intend to spoil them rotten.
Oh, no!
Look. Mommy's laughing.
She seems pretty healthy to me.
Yep.
Oh, I can't wait to get up on my feet again.
Neither can we.
Oh.
Hmm.
Now, that's weird.
Oh!
What happened?
Well, I'm not sure, but I could've sworn l saw both girls in the treetop laughing.
That might not be as crazy as you think.
"For Mother. . ."
"For Mother. . ."
Totoro
Totoro
Totoro
Totoro
Who leaves the seeds
For you to find?
Follow them
And you will see
A treasure there
Then plant the seeds
And help them grow
It may seem like a dream
But things are not what they seem
Now begins a new adventure
For you
And you'll be with Totoro
Totoro
Totoro
Totoro
Living in the forest trees
For such a very, very long time
There you'll be with Totoro
Totoro
Totoro
Totoro
You only see him
When you're very young
A magical adventure for you
It's magic for you
Rain tumbles down
The bus is late
Suddenly
A furry wet giant
Is by your side
Don't be afraid
Just open wide
Your umbrella for him
Watch him play in the rain
Now begins a new adventure
For you
And you'll be with Totoro
Totoro
Totoro
Totoro
And on a moonlit night
He plays a magic flute in the sky
There you'll be with Totoro
Totoro
Totoro
Totoro
You only see him
When you're very young
A magical adventure for you
It's magic for you
THE END
Good morning, Bastian.
I had another dream, Dad, about Mom.
I understand, son.
But we have to get on with things, right?
Bastian, we each have responsibilities.
We can't let Mom's death...
...be an excuse for not getting the job done, right?
Yes.
Son, it's time you and I had a talk.
I got a call from your math teacher yesterday.
She says that you were...
...drawing horses in your math book.
Unicorns. They were unicorns.
What?
Nothing.
She also says you don't do your homework on time.
I'm very disappointed you didn't even try out for the swimming team.
As to those riding lessons you wanted...
You say you love horses but you're afraid to get on a real one.
You're old enough to get your head down out of the clouds and...
...and keep both feet on the ground.
Okay.
Stop daydreaming.
Start facing your problems. Okay?
There, I think we've had a nice talk.
We should have more.
Have a good day, son.
Don't be late for school again.
But, yesterday I wasn't.
Hey, it's the weirdo.
Weirdo, you got any cash for us today?
Let's get him!
You can't get away.
You're dead, chicken!
We'll get you!
- Where's your money?
- I don't have any!
No money? Mamma's boy is holding out.
If you ain't got money, you go in the garbage.
Maybe the chicken can lay an egg in there.
Who said you could get out of the garbage?
Get back in there.
Not again.
Not again!
Where are you going, wimp?
- He went that way.
- Which way?
Get out of here! I don't like kids.
Are you still here? Didn't you hear me?
You're hiding, aren't you?
The video arcade is down the street.
Here we just sell small rectangular objects.
They're called books.
They require effort and make no beeps.
On your way.
I know books. I have 186 of them at home.
Comic books.
No, I've read Treasure Island...
...The Last of the Mohicans, Wizard of Oz...
...Lord of the Rings,
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Tarzan.
Who are you running away from?
Some kids from school.
Why?
They threw me in the garbage.
Why not punch them in the nose?
I don't know.
What's that book about?
Oh, this is something special.
Well, what is it?
Look.
Your books are safe.
While you're reading them...
...you get to become
Tarzan or Robinson Crusoe.
But that's what I like about them.
But afterwards you get to be a little boy again.
What do you mean?
Listen.
Have you ever been...
...Captain Nemo...
...trapped inside your submarine while the giant squid is attacking you?
Yes.
Weren't you afraid you couldn't escape?
But it's only a story.
That's what I'm talking about.
The ones you read...
...are safe.
And that one isn't?
Don't worry about it.
But you just said it was...
Forget about it.
This book is not for you.
Koreander's.
What can I do for you?
They run maybe 300, 370...
It will take me a couple of a weeks.
Math test. Oh, no!
"It was midnight in the Howling Forest.
"The wind whistled
through the tops of the ancient trees.
"Suddenly, something enormous...
"...crashed and rumbled
through the eerie woods. "
What's that?
Excuse me...
...but would it be all right if I joined you this evening?
You see, I've been traveling all day.
Now I see why you picked this camp.
A delicious looking limestone rock!
Nice bouquet.
Must be a real vintage year.
Yes, you're right.
Those delicious rocks are the reason we've camped here.
- Is he a nutcase?
- No, he's a Rock Biter.
A Rock Biter!
- Sorry.
- Poor baby.
Pardon me.
That was limestone, with a dash of quartz.
Very tasty.
Where I come from in the North, we us to have exquisite gourmet rocks.
Only now...
...now...
...they're all gone.
I know how it happened.
I swear it wasn't me.
I think I know what it was. Tell us more.
Near my home, there used to be a beautiful lake...
...but then...
...then it was gone.
Did the lake dry up?
No. It just wasn't there anymore.
Nothing was there anymore.
Not even a dried-up lake.
A hole?
A hole would be something.
No, it was Nothing.
And it got bigger and bigger.
First, there was no lake anymore.
And then, finally, no rocks.
If he keeps stuffing his face like that, soon there won't be any rocks here either.
Night Hob, this could be serious!
Rock Biter...
...what you told us is also happening where I live in the West.
A strange sort of Nothing is destroying everything.
Yes. We Night Hobs live in the South and it's there, too.
So, it's not just in our part of Fantasia?
Maybe, it's already everywhere.
Maybe our whole land is in danger.
What can we do?
My people are sending me to the Ivory Tower, to the Empress, for help.
We are on the same...
We are on the same mission.
After all, if the Empress can't save us...
...who could?
Then why are we all just sitting here...
...instead of taking off for the Ivory Tower?
What are we waiting for?
Yes. Let's go now.
Wake up!
Come on, old girl.
We can't just hang around here.
Wake up! Ready for takeoff.
Oh, stupid bat!
We can't wait for a snail. Can I carry you?
Don't worry. It's a racing snail.
But we can't even wait for a racing snail.
It really is a racing snail.
Nobody gives a hoot about me and my stupid bat.
Maybe I'll take a few of these yummy gourmet rocks, for the road...
The Nothing!
Look!
There it is!
The heart of Fantasia!
I never knew it was that beautiful.
Stay awake!
I told you to stay awake.
The home of the Empress.
She's our only hope.
Friends, I know why you are all here.
The Nothing...
...is destroying our world.
I also know that you...
...have come to beseech...
...the Empress for help.
But I have terrible news.
The Empress herself has become deathly ill.
There seems to be a mysterious link between her illness and the Nothing.
She's dying.
So, she cannot save us.
But there just might be one chance.
The Plains People who hunt the purple buffalo...
...have among them a great warrior.
He alone has a chance to fight the Nothing and save us.
He is our only hope.
His name is Atreyu.
Atreyu.
"The Empress had already
sent for the great warrior.
"When he finally appeared
on the terrace of the Ivory Tower...
"...he carried with him
the hopes of all Fantasia. "
A little boy!
I'm sorry, but this is not the time nor place for children.
You must leave.
If you don't want me here, you shouldn't have sent for me.
Is he a nutcase?
It was not you we sent for.
We wanted Atreyu.
I am Atreyu.
Not Atreyu the Child.
Atreyu the Warrior.
I am the only Atreyu of the Plains People.
But I'll be happy to go back to hunting the purple buffalo.
Wait!
Come back, please.
If you really are the Atreyu we sent for...
...you would be willing to go on a quest?
Yes, of course.
What kind of a quest?
To find a cure for the Empress...
...and to save our world.
No one can give you any advice except this:
You must go alone.
You must leave all your weapons behind.
It will be very dangerous.
Any chance of success?
I do not know.
But if you fail...
...the Empress will surely die...
...and our whole world will be destroyed.
When do I begin?
Now. And you must hurry, Atreyu.
The Nothing grows stronger every day.
Take this.
The Auryn!
He who wears the Auryn speaks for the Empress.
It will guide and protect you.
Wake up.
Farewell, Atreyu.
Take care.
"At the same time...
"...elsewhere in Fantasia,
a Creature of Darkness...
"...also began his quest."
"They had been traveling aimlessly
for almost a week...
"...but they could not find a cure
for the Empress.
"Neither Atreyu nor his horse, Artax,
had the vaguest suspicion...
"...that the Creature of Darkness,
the Gmork...
"...was already tracking them down."
What is it, Artax?
Is it time to go already?
I know what you want. It's time to eat.
Good idea.
No, it's a great idea!
No, not too much.
We still have a long way to go.
"Atreyu and Artax had searched
the Silver Mountains...
"...the Desert of Shattered Hopes
and the Crystal Towers...
"...without success.
"And so, there was only one chance left.
"To find Morla, the Ancient One...
"...the wisest being in Fantasia...
"...whose home was the Shell Mountain...
"...somewhere in the deadly
Swamps of Sadness. "
Come on, boy. Come on.
That's it.
It's okay.
"Everyone knew that
whoever let the sadness overtake him...
"...would sink into the swamp."
You're doing fine, Artax.
Come on, Artax.
What's the matter?
What's wrong?
Come on, boy.
What's the matter?
I understand.
It's too difficult for you.
Artax, you're sinking! Come on!
Turn around! You have to! Now!
Fight against the sadness.
Artax, please.
Don't let the sadness of the swamps get to you.
You have to try. You have to care.
For me.
You're my friend. I love you.
Artax, stupid horse.
You got to move or you'll die.
Move. Please.
I won't give up. Don't quit.
Artax!
The Shell Mountain.
Morla, the Ancient One.
Morla.
But that's impossible.
They couldn't have heard me.
Are you Morla, the Ancient One?
Not that it matters, but yes.
Please help me. Do you recognize this?
Well...
...we haven't seen...
...the Auryn in a long time.
We?
Is there someone else here, too?
We haven't spoken to anyone else...
...for thousands of years.
So we started talking...
...to ourselves.
Morla, I bring terrible news.
Did you know the Empress is ill?
Not that it matters, but yes.
Actually, we don't care.
If I don't save her, she'll die.
There's a terrible Nothing sweeping over the land.
Don't you care?
We don't even care...
...whether or not we care.
Do you have a cold?
No. We're allergic...
...to youth.
You know how to help the Empress, don't you?
Not that it matters...
...but yes.
If you don't tell me and the Nothing keeps coming, you'll die too. Both of you.
Die?
That, at least, would be something.
Please help me.
You said you knew the answer.
We're tired of sneezing.
Go away! Nothing matters.
That's not true.
If it didn't matter to you, you could tell me.
Clever boy.
Tell me, please.
We don't know.
But you can ask...
...the Southern Oracle.
How can I get there?
You can't.
It's 10,000 miles away.
But that's so far.
That's right.
Forget it.
Give up.
No.
Atreyu wouldn't quit now.
Oh, boy!
"After days and nights
of unconsciousness...
"...Atreyu slowly opened his eyes...
"...and found himself
in strange surroundings.
"He was clean and
his wounds were dressed. "
Leaving so soon?
I was just going to...
I have to...
- I was trying to...
- Sneak away?
Yes. I mean, no.
I like children.
For breakfast?
Never. I'm a luck dragon.
My name is Falkor.
- And my name is...
- Atreyu. And you're on a quest.
How did you know that?
You were unconscious.
You talked in your sleep.
Could you get around...
...and scratch behind my right ear?
I can never quite reach it.
Here?
That's so good.
Thank you.
So, little fellow, you're on your way to the Southern Oracle?
Yes. But it's hopeless.
- It's too far away.
- I wouldn't necessarily say that.
You know how to get there?
Sure. It's right around the corner.
How did all this happen?
With luck.
You brought me the entire 10,000 miles?
No. Only 9,891...
...as the dragon flies.
You're amazing.
Having a luck dragon with you is the only way to go on a quest.
Things will work out fine.
Never give up and good luck will find you.
It's good to have a friend again.
You have more than one.
Look.
Get out of my light, wench.
You're disturbing my scientific work.
You and your scientific work.
What the boy needs now is one of my potions.
The boy will need my scientific advice much more.
But not until he's well.
Get back to your own corner, Engy.
I'm always finding you in my place.
He's well.
Now it's my turn with him.
No, you don't!
I'll decide when he's well.
It's your turn when I say it is.
Well, little man, still in pain?
It's all right.
I like that.
The patient telling the doctor it's all right.
It has to hurt if it's to heal.
Drink that.
Good?
That's my bat-wing broth.
There's eye of newt in there, tree mold, old lizard brains...
...scales from a rancid sea serpent.
Just where did you and your dragon come from?
What are you on to?
Anything of interest to the scientific community?
My name is Atreyu.
I came to find the Southern Oracle.
Here we go again.
You've come to the right place, my boy.
I am somewhat of an expert on the Southern Oracle.
"It is my scientific specialty."
It is my scientific specialty.
Why don't you sit down and be quiet for once?
You keep quiet, wench.
It's my turn.
My name is Engywook.
She's Urgl. Ever heard of me?
I don't think so.
You don't move in scientific circles.
I am the expert on the Southern Oracle.
You've come to the right place.
There's no fool like an old fool.
Wait! Stay here.
The observatory. To the winch, wench.
Come on, lazybones!
Can't you go any faster?
I've been studying the Southern Oracle for years.
Some day I'll publish my book:
A Century of Studying the Southern Oracle, by Professor Engywook.
Volume I: The Early Years.
Have you ever been to the Southern Oracle?
What do you think?
I work scientifically.
Look.
Is that the Southern Oracle?
No. It's the first of the two gates you must pass through...
...before you reach the Southern Oracle...
...and get me the final information for my book.
Of course, most people...
...never get that far.
Why?
The Sphinxes' eyes...
...stay closed until someone who does not feel his own worth...
...tries to pass by.
Here comes one that looks fancy.
Let's see what he really thinks of himself.
Go on, scaredy-cat!
It's my turn. Let me see. I'm the scientist.
He's going on.
I think he'll make it.
The Sphinxes' eyes, are they open or shut?
Let me see.
They're shut.
The eyes are opening!
Did he make it? Did he?
Fancy armor doesn't help.
The Sphinxes can see straight into your heart.
Listen.
Next time let me see what happens.
It's my telescope.
I'm going to try.
Don't go yet.
I haven't told you about the next gate.
It's even worse than this one.
He'll never make it.
Don't start to doubt yourself. Be confident.
Be confident.
Run, Atreyu!
Run, Atreyu!
Run! Now!
He made it.
He made it.
He made it!
You could use a dose of juicy vitamins, too.
He made it!
Atreyu made it through the Sphinx gate.
- I always said he could do it.
- Good.
But that's no reason to fall out of the basket again.
I knew he'd be safe.
Nonsense. You don't understand anything.
The worst one is coming up.
Next is the Magic Mirror Gate.
Atreyu must face his true self.
So what? That won't be too hard for him.
That's what everyone thinks.
But kind people find that they are cruel.
Brave men discover they are really cowards.
Confronted with their true selves...
...most men run away screaming.
Now, this is going too far.
What if they...
...really do know about me in Fantasia?
The Southern Oracle?
Do not be afraid.
We will not harm you.
We have been waiting for you a long time.
Are you the Southern Oracle?
Yes, we are.
Then you must know what can save Fantasia.
Yes, we do.
Well, what is it? I have to know!
The Empress...
... needs...
... a new name.
A new name? That's all?
But that's easy.
I can give her any name she wants.
No one from Fantasia...
... can do it.
Only a human child...
... can give her this new name.
A human child? Where can I find one?
You can only find one...
... beyond the boundaries of Fantasia.
If you want to save our world...
... you must hurry.
We don't know...
... how much longer
we can withstand the Nothing.
Falkor!
Hurry, Falkor! The Nothing's everywhere.
Don't worry.
We'll reach the boundaries of Fantasia.
- Do you know where they are?
- I have no idea.
Then how do we find a human child?
With luck.
Faster, Falkor! We have to hurry.
All right, hang on tight.
What a shame they don't ask me.
My mother...
...she had such a wonderful name.
"On and on they flew until they reached the Sea of Possibilities...
"...where they could go no further."
Look, Atreyu. The Nothing.
Atreyu.
Falkor!
Where are you?
Atreyu! Where are you?
They look like big...
...good, strong hands, don't they?
I always thought that's what they were.
My little friends.
The little man with his racing snail...
...the Night Hob...
...even the stupid bat.
I couldn't hold on to them.
The Nothing...
...pulled them right out of my hands.
I failed.
No, you didn't fail. I'm the one who failed.
I was the one chosen to stop the Nothing.
But I lost the Auryn.
I can't find my luck dragon.
So I won't be able to get beyond the boundaries of Fantasia.
Listen.
The Nothing...
...will be here any minute.
I will just sit here...
...and let it take me away, too.
They look...
...like good...
...strong...
...hands, don't they?
Morla?
Artax!
If you come any closer...
...I will rip you to shreds.
Who are you?
I am Gmork.
And you, whoever you are...
...can have the honor of being my last victim.
I will not die easily.
I am a warrior.
Brave warrior.
Then fight the Nothing.
I can't. I can't get beyond the boundaries of Fantasia.
What's so funny?
Fantasia has no boundaries.
That's not true.
- You're lying.
- Foolish boy.
Don't you know anything about Fantasia?
It's the world of human fantasy.
Every part...
...every creature...
...is a piece of the dreams and hopes of mankind.
Therefore...
...it has no boundaries.
Why is Fantasia dying then?
Because people have begun to lose their hopes...
...and forget their dreams.
So the Nothing grows stronger.
What is the Nothing?
It's the emptiness that's left.
It is like a despair...
...destroying this world.
And I have been trying to help it.
But why?
Because people who have no hopes...
...are easy to control.
And whoever has the control...
...has the power.
Who are you, really?
I am the servant...
...of the power behind the Nothing.
I was sent to kill the only one...
...who could have stopped the Nothing.
I lost him in the Swamps of Sadness.
His name...
...was Atreyu.
If we're about to die anyway,
I'd rather die fighting.
Come for me, Gmork. I am Atreyu!
Falkor!
Atreyu!
"That was the end of Fantasia.
"Only a few fragments of this once...
"...rich and beautiful world
had been left by the Nothing. "
Good old Falkor.
- Can you see anything? Anything at all?
- No.
All the land is gone.
I know. And all because I failed.
You tried.
Could the Ivory Tower still be standing?
Let's hope so, Atreyu. Let's hope so.
Let the Auryn guide you.
If the Ivory Tower still stands, take us there.
The Ivory Tower!
The Empress.
Go on.
Why do you look so sad?
I have failed you, Empress.
You haven't.
You brought him with you.
Who?
The earthling child.
The one...
...who can save us all.
You knew about the earthling child?
Of course. I knew everything.
My horse died, I nearly drowned.
I just barely got away from the Nothing.
For what? To find out what you already knew?
It was the only way to get in touch with an earthling.
But I didn't get in touch with an earthling!
Yes, you did.
He has suffered with you.
He went through everything
you went through.
And now, he has come here...
... with you.
He is very close, listening...
...to every word we say.
What?
Where is he?
If he's so close, why doesn't he arrive?
He doesn't realize he's already part of The Neverending Story.
The Neverending Story?
What's that?
Just as he is sharing all your adventures...
...others are sharing his.
They were with him...
... when he hid from the boys
in the bookstore.
But that's impossible!
They were with him when he took the book...
...with the Auryn symbol on the cover...
... in which he's reading his own story...
...right now.
I can't believe it.
They can't be talking about me.
What if he doesn't appear?
Then our world will disappear.
And so will I.
How could he let that happen?
He doesn't understand that he's the one with the power to stop it.
He simply can't imagine...
...that one little boy could be that important.
Is it really me?
Maybe he doesn't know what to do.
What do I have to do?
He has to give me a new name.
He's already chosen it.
He just has to call it out.
But it's only a story. It's not real.
It's only a story.
Atreyu, no!
Bastian!
Why don't you do what you dream, Bastian?
But I can't.
I must keep my feet on the ground.
Call my name.
Bastian, please!
Save us!
All right! I'll do it!
I'll save you. I will do what I dream.
Why is it so dark?
In the beginning, it is always dark.
What is that?
One grain of sand.
It is all that remains of my vast empire.
Fantasia has totally disappeared?
Yes.
Then everything's been in vain.
No, it hasn't.
Fantasia can arise anew...
...from your dreams and wishes.
How?
Open your hand.
What are you going to wish for?
I don't know.
Then there will be no Fantasia anymore.
How many wishes do I get?
As many as you want.
And the more wishes you make...
...the more magnificent
Fantasia will become.
Really?
Try it.
Then my first wish is...
Falkor, it's even more beautiful than I thought!
- Like it?
- Falkor, it's wonderful.
Falkor, it's like the Nothing never was.
Atreyu and Artax!
What would you like to wish for next?
Look, there they are.
It's a monster!
Get them, Falkor!
Let's see how you like it, chickens.
Down here.
We're going to get you!
Bastian made many other wishes...
... and had many other
amazing adventures...
... before he finally returned
to the ordinary world.
But that's another story.
Mom?
Dad?
Al?
Hello!
Al?
The thunderbolt.
Papa.
Papa.
Papa.
Okay! Bring her in!
That's it.
Okay, now put those... yeah.
Secure it over there.
Yeah, the other tree.
That's it. Tighten it up.
Okay! Up, up!
Go.
Over! A little bit.
Watch it. Back it up. Keep it going.
Back her up. That's it.
Hey, Terry, what's that thing called again?
A geode. Thunder eggs.
- I don't think we should be doing this.
- Hey, chill out. They'll never know.
My dad will have a seizure.
It's your own fault. You should have called me before they filled it in.
- Yeah, but...
- There's gotta be more down there.
You know how much you can get for a big one? 100 bucks.
It smells like something died in there.
- It looks like a cave.
- Wicked.
- Be careful.
- Here.
- Jeez.
- It's nothin'.
What is it?
What the hell was that noise?
I don't think we should be doing this.
Who cares?
We're rich.
Come on.
Al, don't! Wait a sec!
You promised I could have these.
I said that 3 months ago.
They've been sitting in my room.
But, Al...
Quit calling me Al. My name is Alexandra.
- Well, aren't we gonna launch 'em?
- You can do whatever you want.
- I've gotta go.
- Where?
- You promised we could launch them.
- I'm going shopping with Lori and Linda.
The Lee sisters.
Al, wait! What about the thunderbolt?
Just forget about the thunderbolt.
It's gone.
What do you need her for, anyway?
I mean, what's the big deal?
Well, ever since I burnt a hole on the roof, my dad says I can't launch any of my rockets without supervision.
Hey, I'll supervise.
Hey! You guys, wait for me!
Come on!
Get in the car!
- What are those for?
- Live cargo.
Forget it. Got wet in the trash. Totaled.
How long do you think they can live without air?
- Hey, man, that's cruel.
- Come on. It's neat.
Glen?
Glen!
It's just irresponsibility. I don't know.
Is it too late to call Mrs. Vandergrift?
Daddy, please, you can't call a baby sitter.
I'm gonna be 16 in wot weeks.
You said I was mature enough to accept the responsibility.
And, honestly, I promise there won't be any problems.
Well, what do you think, Glen?
Can you be trusted?
I don't know.
If your father and I agree to let the two of you stay alone for 3 whole days,
- how can we be sure that you'll behave?
- It was Terry that started it.
If Terry jumped off a bridge,
I suppose you'd jump off, too.
Sure. Why not?
Look, I can take care of Terry and I can take care of Glen.
I can take care of this house.
Please?
All right. But, you, young man, are grounded for the weekend.
And that means that you do not leave this house until we come back.
Grounded? For real?
For real.
And after dinner, pal, you fill in that hole.
Okay.
Good night, Glen.
No, leave it on.
Glen?
What's with you today?
It's... I don't know.
It's something about that hole.
What do you mean?
I don't know. It's just weird.
Well, you... you filled it in, didn't you?
Yeah. But Terry told me something.
- What?
- Well, he said a long time ago, when they were building our house, a workman got killed.
And the other workmen didn't want to tell the police, so they sealed him up in one of our walls.
Look, son... let me tell you something about Terry.
You remember last year when Terry's mom died.
Yeah.
Well, ever since then,
Terry's been a little strange.
I think he's kind of angry inside that his mom's gone.
So, you just remember that when he gets destructive or... tries to scare you.
I think he's just a little confused, that's all.
- You know what I'm saying?
- I think so.
- You want me to turn the light on?
- No, it's okay.
Good night, tiger.
- Dad?
- Yeah.
Never mind.
- Good night.
- Good night, pal.
Don't forget that Angus gets his pills every day.
Make sure they're hidden in his dog food or he'll spit them out.
- And I don't want him on the furniture.
- I know, Mom.
- Goodbye, hon.
- Bye.
- Bye, Mom.
- Goodbye.
- Bye, Dad.
- See you guys.
- Goodbye!
- Bye!
Bye, Mom.
And don't forget, the numbers where we'll be are on the refrigerator.
Al, if you need us for any reason, don't be afraid to give us a call.
- It's just being responsible.
- I know, Mom.
- Remember, you stay in this weekend.
- Okay.
And I want the house clean when we come home. No parties.
Okay!
Lori! Linda!
Hey, wow! Great party!
I don't know. Here.
What a tool. He just totaled his car.
Brutal!
Hey, somebody get this dog a beer.
Put me down!
Get away!
Come on!
Hey! Bug off, Angus! You stink!
I'd like smell you when you're 97.
He's not 97.
In dog years.
It's just not gonna break.
Why don't we get the Lee sisters to look at it?
Yeah.
No, we could throw it off the roof tomorrow. Come on. Let's go party.
- She won't let us.
- Sure she will. Why not?
It's just... forget it.
Told ya. Look at it.
Is it supposed to do that?
I don't know.
Maybe it just got compressed air when it was being formed or something.
Look. It made some kind of marks.
It's words. What's it say?
It's weird.
"Aca...
"Kuto...
"Alla...
Eta."
He made his way down the dark hallway.
And the squeak keeps getting louder.
And there's also this... like a laugh.
And there's this weird tearing sound.
So she goes to the door and she opens it really slowly.
And there, in the rocking chair, is the decomposed corpse of her dead father.
And in his lap is the severed head of her boyfriend.
And he's tearing out hair by the handful.
- You made that up.
- I believe it.
- Come on. It's bullshit.
- Weird things happen all the time.
So we make up ghost stories to explain the powers inside us that we don't understand.
- What kind of powers?
- Well, like...
- Will you guys ever do levitation?
- I've seen that. It's an illusion.
No, it's a matter of concentration.
It really works.
Do you believe in all that stuff?
Me, too.
Now, everyone just... clear your mind.
- You broke your concentration.
- No, I broke my fingernail.
- Too much junk food.
- It doesn't matter. It's not the weight.
Hey, little man, come here.
- Glen, go back to your room.
- No, come here. He'll be all right.
- Let's see if we can levitate him.
- It's a cinch. He's a midget.
- Okay, we'll just use two people.
- Sit down.
Brad.
Okay, hold your arms out, one on top of the other, and make little circles to trans... transmit and stimulate the energy.
And everyone else concentrate.
Now everyone just... clear your minds... and think of Glen as light as a feather.
Concentrate.
Okay.
Like... dust... drifting in front of the windows, like... dandelions in the breeze.
Rise.
Rise...
Hey. Help!
Come on! Get me down!
Are you okay?
Glen.
Maybe I won't do that... again.
Glen.
Glen, you all right?
I think it's because he cried in front of everybody.
Hey, Glen... don't be embarrassed.
Crying's nothing.
Remember when Trevor Stubblefield pantsed me in front of the whole auditorium?
Yeah. And I barfed on Steve Slavit after the 12-minute run.
- I want to call Mom and Dad.
- Glen, no.
- I want you to call them.
- What am I gonna tell them?
We're scared because we levitated Glen and he broke the light? Great.
- You must love Mrs. Vandergrift.
- Al...
Look, Terry can sleep over and keep you company.
Let's all just get some sleep.
I'm gonna lock up.
You really barfed on Steve Slavit?
Yep.
Terry...
I love you.
Mom?
I need you.
Mommy.
I love you.
Terry... come to me.
Terry...
I've missed you so much.
No. Oh, no.
Oh, no.
The workman.
Angus.
What's going on?
I'm really sorry.
Yeah. He was really old.
Yeah.
He was 97.
They don't live much beyond that.
Well... you want to come over later and mess around?
Sure. Yeah.
Guess I'll see you later?
See you later.
Dad!
Oh, great.
What'd you do with Angus?
Hey. Don't worry about it.
Aren't you gonna call Mom and Dad?
- No, I'll take care of it.
- Well, if you're not going to, I am.
Glen, Mom and Dad are gonna be home tomorrow.
I don't care. I want them to know what happened.
You're not calling them.
- Nice try.
- Fine.
- I'll just call them later.
- What's the matter with him?
- Isn't romper room on today?
- Buzz off, clown face.
Don't you have to go upstairs and change your pampers or something?
- Don't you have to go and join the circus?
- Hey, you guys, come on.
In a time before the Earth,
before the sun, and before the light of the stars,
when all was darkness and chaos,
the old gods, the forgotten gods,
ruled the darkness.
But what was theirs now belongs to the world of light and substance,
and the old gods, the rightful masters, are jealous,
watching mankind with a hatred that is as boundless as the stars,
with plans for the destruction of man that are beyond imagining!
There's a passageway between our physical world of light, pleasure,
and their spiritual world of madness and pain.
A gate behind which the demons wait
for the chance to take back what is theirs!
Eric really likes you.
You've gotta come to the beach with us.
- Well...
- Look, everybody's going.
We're having a bonfire and everything.
I don't know. I mean, I just can't go.
Lookit, just leave him some Gerber's. He'll be fine.
Al, you can't go out. What about Angus?
What about what happened last night?
You have to call Mom and Dad.
- Glen, cool out.
- What's he talking about?
Tell 'em.
Angus died last night.
- Tell 'em about the other stuff.
- There is no other stuff.
What's the matter with you guys?
Something really scary happened last night.
- What?
- The levitation.
You guys were there.
Hey, little man, that was just an illusion.
What do you know, lover boy?
- What is your problem?
- You, Alexandra.
- You're acting like a baby.
- Just shut up.
- Fag.
- Hey.
Tres uncool.
- What are we waiting for?
- Look...
You can't back down now. You have to go.
I have to do something about Angus.
Take him to the animal shelter or something.
- Eric will do it.
- Yeah. Yeah, I'll do it.
And we'll all go to the mall and get munchies and stuff and we'll all meet up there.
Come on!
- Don't be too long, Eric!
- Yeah, okay.
- See ya.
- See you at the mall!
Come on, Alexandra. He'll be okay.
Oh, no.
We're in big trouble.
Tell me about it.
- How could it come back by itself?
- I think I know what this means.
You know, with the levitation and all that other weird stuff?
What?
You got demons.
- Demons?
- Come on.
We better try to cover it up first.
You take this side here.
I don't think this is gonna be enough.
Give me a break. Come on.
Slow down.
How do you know so much about this stuff?
I got something to show you.
Shit! Closed. Sorry, dude.
No vacancies.
They're called sacrifyx, and my dad brought it from Europe, and it's got all this stuff in it.
See, these guys are, like, really serious about demonology.
And it's like they're trying to warn you.
See? These guys knew.
They wrote their own music.
They got their lyrics from this thing called The Dark Book.
That's like the Bible for demons.
And here's the creepy part.
This is their only album.
And after they made it, they all died in a plane crash.
- And look at this. Demon Lord.
- Terry, come on.
Wait a minute. See? The lyrics in the album tell you how to summon the demons.
And there's this certain time when these constellations are aligned when you can open the gate and let the old gods... those are the demons, come through.
Well, I checked, and it's, like, now.
- Terry, but...
- What?
- Terry, this is a record album.
- But, you see, there are these songs that tell you about the whole ritual for opening the gate. We did it.
Here.
Start by reading this aloud.
You know what it means?
"Gods of darkness, breeders of chaos,
"come forth and take possession of this vile world."
And you need blood.
Remember when you cut yourself?
It's all in here.
The hole...
Okay.
The geode.
And look at this.
The levitation.
What's that supposed to prove?
It proves we're in big trouble.
I didn't tell you about the most important part of the ritual.
The sacrifice.
- We didn't kill anybody.
- It doesn't have to be a person.
It can be an animal.
Well, then, how come we haven't seen any demons?
I think it's because the sacrifice wasn't complete.
If we had put the offering in the hole, it would have blown the gate wide open.
I think right now it's like only open a crack.
They can influence us, but they can't get through.
It's just...
How can this be true?
Wait. You haven't heard anything yet.
- What's this?
- It's the album... backwards.
It tells you how to close the gates.
"We consecrate this ground, this world of light.
"We curse the abominations of darkness.
"We block the passage of evil.
May the old devils depart!
"May they burn in the fires of their own damnation.
"May they freeze in the infinite cold and darkness of their own hideous creation."
- Isn't that kind of insulting?
- I guess it's supposed to be.
I mean, we're trying to get rid of them.
- Maybe you should do it one more time.
- All right.
Begone, begone, begone!
- Thou art hideous, filth-eating, unspeak...
- What the hell are you doing?
What's under the door?
Hey, did you guys dig in that hole again?
We accidentally summoned demons who used to rule the universe to come and take over the world.
Yeah. We found out about it from one of Terry's albums.
Well, they're gone now.
Well, so what's under the door?
See? They're gone.
It worked.
You guys are weird.
Thought you were going to the beach today.
I was, but I spent all my money.
On what?
Well, are you gonna just stand there or do you want to launch it?
- Come on.
- All right!
Listen to this.
"Beware, conjurer.
Once set free into our world,
"the power of the old gods is unimaginable
"as they seek 2 human sacrifices to establish their hell on Earth.
"The ruination of mankind lurks just beyond the gate.
"The demons can only be destroyed and the gate closed once again
"by a true spirit of gentle passions wielding energy
"derived from pure love and light."
Okay. Houston, ready for liftoff.
- Ready?
- Ready.
Ready, Houston.
Okay.
Blastoff!
Yeah! All right!
Yeah!
That's the best.
- Who's that?
- Well, there's one way to find out.
Demons aren't gonna ring the doorbell.
Worse. The Lee sisters.
'Cause we got you a great new top, and I got these new jeans,
Hey... I thought you were going to the beach tonight.
- We're having a slumber party.
- And you're not invited, so don't get all retarded on us.
Alexandra, what's your problem?
- Hey, don't touch that.
- I'm just looking at it.
Come on, that's my dad's. Put that down.
He never lets us play with it.
Okay, okay. Don't have a cow.
Way to go.
Here.
The thunderbolt.
- She didn't throw it out.
- Hey, are you guys in bed yet?
Almost. Put it back.
What are you doing?
- Probably fagging off.
- What did you do to your face?
None of your beeswax, four-eyes.
- I think it's a definite improvement.
- Hey, eat your feet, dwarf.
- Suck my nose till my head caves in.
- Why don't you grow up?
- Drop dead.
- Up yours!
- Piss off!
- Why don't you just shut up!
Just go to bed.
Did you ever want a brother or a sister or anything?
Nope.
Indians. Oh, boy.
"Dark Master, demon of unimaginable size and power."
Terry?
Terry. Terry.
Are you awake?
Al! Al! They're back!
- The moths came back!
- What? What is it?
- They broke the window! They're in my room!
- What are you talking about?
Oh, my gosh.
Terry?
Hey, Terry, wake up.
Terry!
- Terry?
- What did you do to your hair?
Real cute.
Guys, get over here!
Al, get in! Al!
Get it off of me!
- Go!
- Let's go!
Come on! Hurry!
- Where are we going?
- Run!
Somebody tell me what's going on!
Mom! Dad!
You've been bad!
Glen! Come on!
What are we gonna do?
Back door!
What are we gonna do?
Oh, shoot!
- Hurry up, Al! Hurry up, Al!
- Would you guys shut up?
I don't see anything.
- Come on!
- I'm trying!
- Let me take a look first.
- Good idea.
Al, I think you better come back!
Shut up, you guys!
Al, come back.
What do you want? What is it?
Come on!
- Hurry up!
- Come on, hurry up!
Hurry!
Look.
Are you okay?
- What the hell is going on?
- Somebody knock her out again.
I'm calling the police.
Answer it!
Hello.
You've been bad!
We have to close the gate.
We have to go to the hole and do it right.
You mean, you guys were serious about that demon stuff?
What does it look like?
- What the hell are you talking about?
- The spells, they're in the basement!
Who's gonna go get them?
Are you sure we can get rid of them?
Yeah. I've got all the spells and curses to banish the demons.
- Demons? What kind?
- Don't ask.
- How do you know what to do?
- Just trust me. I know what I'm doing.
Right.
- Al.
- What is it?
Forget it.
Over there.
What? Do they hate music?
Great, now what do we do?
- The Bible.
- What?
Prayers. The Bible.
That's what they always use!
These guys are older than the Bible.
Do you have anything better?
- How do we know what to read?
- We'll find something.
Yeah. We went to Sunday school.
We should've called Mom and Dad before this.
- I wish Mrs. Vandergrift was here.
- It's a little too late for that.
- We found one.
- Good.
Okay.
Let's do it.
The gate's open.
I know it is.
- No, it isn't.
- How do you know, Terry?
'Cause we'd all be dead meat by now.
We'd be the sacrifices.
- Sacrifices?
- I told you.
The demons need two human sacrifices to stay and make their hell on Earth.
- We don't all have to go.
- Yeah.
Maybe it would be better if we waited inside.
My heroes.
You've got to be kidding.
I hope this works.
Me, too.
Here it goes.
"Deliver me from my enemies, father in heaven.
"Deliver me from the workers of iniquity.
And save me from the devils of blood."
"Away from my soul, and return in evening, they howl like the dog.
"Thou shall bury the evils, and they will walk the Earth no more.
"Because of thy strength I will wait for thee, for God is my high tower."
It's working!
Hey, that's pretty good.
Hey. It worked.
- I can still hear them.
- There's one more part here,
- then they should be gone.
- Don't get so close.
- It's okay. It's working.
- Get back!
Don't be such a...
- Terry!
- Terry!
What are we gonna do? Terry!
- Terry!
- Terry!
- Terry!
- Terry!
Hey!
Where is he?
- Hi.
- Hey.
No! Terry! Answer me!
Terry! Answer me!
Help! Glen!
- It's not gonna work!
- Glen! Help me!
Come on!
Let go!
No!
Help! Get me out of here!
Help!
Here he comes!
Get it over here!
- Terry! Grab it!
- Where's the Bible?
- I can't reach it!
- "Deliver me from my enemies, father in heaven.
- Stop it!
- "Deliver me from the workers of iniquity.
- Glen, stop!
- "The devil's of blood.
- For those who lay...
- Glen, stop it!
- You're making them mad!
- Glen, grab my feet!
- Hurry! I'm falling!
- Get it down here farther!
- Glen, help!
- What are we gonna do?
- Got it!
- Hang on!
- Pull me up!
- Hold it!
- Come on!
- It's closing!
- Hurry!
- Come on!
- Pull!
- Hurry up!
My shoe! I lost my shoe!
Wait... Bible. Where's the Bible?
- I don't know what to read.
- Read anything!
"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the Earth."
Shit.
- It's gone!
- It's gone?
- It's gone!
- All right!
All right! All right!
Come on, let's go! Yeah!
Hello?
Wait.
- It's just us.
- What happened?
- It worked.
- I knew it.
- Are you sure?
- No, we're all dead.
- Welcome to heaven.
- What were you guys doing in there?
We heard noises.
- Oh, no.
- What?
Al, what is it?
- What have you been doing, mud wrestling?
- Not funny.
- What are you doing here?
- Came to party.
Thought we'd surprise you.
Well, look, I've had enough surprises for one night.
- Could you guys just please leave?
- Come on, Al. Be real.
- Al, we invited them.
- Well, maybe you should just go with them.
- Fine.
- Come on. Let's go.
- We can take a hint.
- What a drag.
- She's just not ready for me yet, guys.
- Oh, shut up.
Boy, Mom and Dad are gonna be pissed when they see this.
Yeah. What should we tell 'em?
Frisbee.
It's gonna be dawn soon. Why don't we all clean up and get some sleep?
Are you kidding?
I'm not gonna sleep for a week.
- Yeah, come on! Let's go watch some TV.
- Yeah, okay.
Well, I'm gonna go get cleaned up.
- Al?
- Yeah?
You're better than Mrs. Vandergrift any day.
You know, it wouldn't be so bad to have a sister.
Wonder if we can still sell it?
I don't know.
- Here. Catch.
- Glen!
Way to go. Terry!
It's the workman.
I just made it up.
No!
No! No! Let go of me!
- Glen!
- Terry!
Glen! No! Glen!
Glen! Get help!
Glen! Glen!
No!
Glen!
Al!
Al!
Al! Al!
- Let go! Let go!
- Glen! Glen!
Let go!
Glen!
Oh, Glen!
- What the hell was that?
- It's the workman. It got Terry!
- The what?
- He just made it up, and it got him.
- It took him into the wall!
- What do you mean?
It's the first human sacrifice.
Dad's gun.
- It's all my fault.
- Dad's gun! Glen!
- It's all my fault.
- Go get dad's gun!
It's all my fault.
Glen!
Glen, go!
Hurry!
- Hi, it's me, Glen.
- Al!
Glen!
Glen!
Come on!
Help!
Help! Al, help!
Get him off of me!
Al, the rope. Help me!
Al, help me!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Close the door!
Hurry!
Hurry!
- Where's the gun?
- Over there!
Did Terry say that there was some way we could kill them?
Energy derived from... I can't remember!
Shit!
Hey!
- Leave her alone!
- Glen! Let me go!
No! Let me go! No!
Let me go!
Al!
Let me go! Please! No! No!
- Glen! Please!
- No!
Glen!
The second human sacrifice.
Love and light. That's it!
The thunderbolt!
Energy derived from...
Come on! Where is it?
Come on!
Please.
Hell on Earth.
No!
Come back here! Take me instead!
I'm next!
Don't you want another sacrifice?
Come back! Take me instead!
Come back. Come back.
Glen!
Help us!
Glen!
Help us!
Happy Birthday, Al!
Yeah!
Angus!
Oh, Angus.
Good boy.
Angus.
Al!
Glen!
Glen!
Glen.
- Angus!
- Terry.
All right.
Think they'll notice?
Give me a break.
You're my best buddies.

YOU WON'T ANSWER ME?
THEN, KEEP SLEEPING

CHILD?
IS IT YOURS?
NO, BUT I LOVE

IT'S NO USE.
THERE'S NO ONE LEFT.

[Indistinct Chatter]
These guys are great natural athletes.
Jerry, they're developing... their own unique style of baseball here.
I could file on African baseball on a regular basis.
- Maybe, you know, do a feature or...
- Yeah, that's fine.
But enough of these
African baseball stories.
George, there's an opening on the sports desk.
How soon can you and
Suzy get back here?
Um, about a week.
- When, when do you want me to start?
- Hey, man, we need you by Monday.
- Do you want the job or not?
- Yeah! Uh...
Get the cheeseburgers ready, Jerry, because I'm gonna be home by Christmas.
- Thanks a lot, buddy.
- See you soon.
All right!
Ooow!
[Whistle] Susan!
I've got real news!
Wait till I tell you.
I don't wanna miss Eric.
Well, that's downright Jurassic.
Fourth or fifth cervical vertebra, don't you think?
It's a neck structure of a brontosaurus.
- Small head, slender neural cord.
- Let's carbon-date it.
- We could.
- I'll get it ready.
Paris or London?
Shall I send a telex?
- You could.
- What's wrong?
This bone is about 80 years old.
No.
There's no point in showing me that, Susan, my dear.
I wrote it.
Don't you remember?
This, I think, is more what you should be looking at.
Oh, no.
It's not a giraffe.
- Or am I just a total idiot?
- On the contrary.
You're the brightest post-doc we've had out here.
Don't worry about it, my dear.
- I thought I really had something.
- Excuse me.
- Susan, may I speak with you?
- Hello, George.
I'm afraid that your wife has had a slight scientific disappointment.
- You all right?
- It's okay.
I just wanted to find something real important before I left.
Susan, you know that most field work is patience and frustration.
You're young.
Don't rush it.
In other words, some days you eat the bone; other days, the bone eats you.
Come on.
Hi, Nigel. Ready to sharpen his pencils today?
- Must you always be sarcastic?
- Au revoir, Nigel.
Is that Little Miss
Scientist's latest discovery?
Yes.
From Bateke. She's top-notch at her job, Nigel... whether you like her or not.
- Is it any good?
- I doubt it.
Now don't patronize me, Eric, please. I know that look.
How good is it?
[Eric] She knows nothing.
If these scrapings are from Bateke,
I imagine the photo is true.
- A trip is indicated.
- You do know that Etienne is dead.
Oh, yes, terrible thing.
Fine scientist.
Well, are you going to tell her that we're going to Bateke because of her scrapings?
No, I'm not, and neither are you.
Mmm, the beer that made
Ogbomosho famous.
How about that? I can finally say
"Ogbomosho," and we're going home.
The Post is really lucky to get you. It's great.
It's just... I have the funniest feeling about this bone.
Susan, we made a deal.
I wanted to do something real while I was here.
We'll start our real life when we get home.
What's that supposed to mean?
You know.
- A baby.
- Sure, couple, three, four.
- Four!
- I'm one of six!
- Well, then, you have 'em.
- Well, I'd give it a shot.
Carl Yastrzemski Loomis.
That's got kind of a rhythm.
Jane Goodall Loomis, maybe.
Hmm, that'd be all right.
As long as she could throw a spitball.
- I wanted to find my own dinosaur.
- You'll have a reason to come back.
We'll miss you.
- I'll write. I promise.
- Do that.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
I heard about your husband's job.
Congratulations.
Absolutely splendid.
It should suit him.
As you know, I can help you in Washington.
You choose any school or museum you like... and you'll get the highest possible recommendation.
Thank you.
I really appreciate it.
One thing before you go. Dr. Pierre
Dubois from the Red Cross... is in the lab office.
Could you have a chat with him before you leave?
Sure. Of course I will.
- Are you leaving, too?
- Just for a few days.
In fact, we really should get going. Chop, chop.
- Well, very best of luck to you.
- Bye.
Do you know anything about the Senuofo, Dr. Matthews?
- No, not really.
- They are quite remote.
Ten days ago, a government patrol discovered cholera at one of their villages.
They brought back two patients, both, uh, died.
It was not cholera. It was staphylococcus.
It's, uh, food poisoning.
Do you understand that
Dr. Kiviat and I...
- are paleontologists, not physicians?
- Oh, yes.
But the Senuofo have eaten the same diet for a thousand years.
There's never been a recorded case of staphylococcus before.
They have eaten an animal they can't or won't identify.
This, uh... is what they ate.
- Can you identify it?
- Giraffe.
It's impossible.
It's not a mammal.
Listen, George, it's hardly even a detour.
We catch the ferry, see what's going on.
It puts us back a day and a half, maybe two...
Which are the first two days of my new job.
They've been getting the paper out without you all this time.
They don't need you Monday.
Dealing with food poisoning is not your job, Susan.
No, that's not my job.
But finding out what's with these bones is my job.
Turn off the light.
George, it could be an entire skeleton.
It could be a major find, my find.
Go to sleep.
I said, turn off the light, Susan.
We gotta get up and pack tomorrow.
[Smacking]
Damn!
Susan! Susan!
No!
Bitch!
Pardonnez-moi. Was there an
English woman on that thing?
- Une femme anglaise?
- Definitely.
Is there any way I can charter an airplane?
Oh, definitely.
- All right, let's go, right now.
- Next Thursday.
- No, no, no, now. Rapidement.
- Next Thursday.
Isn't there any way
I can get upriver fast?
I have a friend who has got a very fine airplane.
Would you like to charter it?
Yes, definitely.
Kenge Obe offers a variety of package expeditions... tailored to the individual tastes and schedules of the patron.
I seem to be out of brochures at the moment.
I'm surprised this thing can even fly!
Oh, yes. Well, that is because of the skilled ability of the pilot.
How far? How long is it to Sangha?
A long ways. Long, long ways.
But don't worry.
We have plenty of outward fuel supplies.
Kenge Obe is always prepared for every contingency.
- And this...
- Shit.
The finest of your kind music. Bon appetit.
You like it?

Then she leaves me a note like a goddamn milkman or something.
I mean, I gave up six months of my life to come tagging along... in this godforsaken country, six months of my career!
- If you look to the left, [lndistinct]
- I'm sure it's not godforsaken... if you come from here, it's just that... sometimes she's like talking to a stone wall.
- You know what I mean?
- [lndistinct]
Tried talking to her about having kids! My God!
You'd think it was some kind of barbaric custom from dark...
I'm one of six brothers and sisters!
- Is that so? I myself had 19.
- Nineteen?
Yeah, my father had, uh, four wives.
Four wives! I got all
I can handle with one!
I can't let her get away with it.
What would you do?
If it were my wife...
I'd whip the bitch.
[Music][Rock And Roll Continues]

Susan.
Got your note.
George, he's dying.
Dr. Dubois, this is my husband, George Loomis.
- Monsieur.
- Bonjour.
Oh, this is my tour guide, Sky King.
- Do you understand Senuofo?
- Yeah, I speak a little.
We're trying to find out what this man ate.
That's the chief.
He's preparing to die.
- No, no, no, no. No!
- Huh?
- [Native]
- [Native]
[Native]
[Native]
Two of their hunters found it upriver.
- Dead.
- [Native]
[Native]
They have brought the meat back and everyone who ate it is sick... or dead.
[Native]
Looks like a brontosaurus.
[Native]
Where? Where upriver?
George, thank you.
You should bloody well tell me my messages as they come in. - Okay.
It is not okay. You make things very difficult.
Okay.
Eric.
Apparently your favorite post-doc and her husband... are now chasing their bone at a Sangha village upriver.
- Where did you get that information?
- Dubois.
- Red Cross.
- Damn it.
Blast it!
We're at the wrong place.
Get me government house.
Tommy!
- What is going on?
- You'll find out in due course.
We're going to need a boat and an escort. Tommy!
She's a persistent little devil, isn't she?
If this is where they left the carcass, then it should be here.
Sounds logical.
It must have washed with the current.
We're gonna have to look over there.
What's downriver?
Hey, Charlie.
[Speaking Native Dialect]
[Native]
No problem.
You won't get lost.
This is the Kenge Obe communications module.
There's a transceiver.
There's a transmitter chip.
You can... You can beep each other.
Also, the wraps and radio, plus this excellent guide.
Rent or buy? Food is extra. I'll be back to pick you up in two days.
Make it a rental and tell him he goes with us.
Hey, Charlie.
[Native]
- [Native]
- [Protesting]
No problem.
[Susan]
Oh, my God! George.
Hey! Where are ya going?
[Native]
"No problem."
What a place, huh?
Something big's been through here.
Look at those broken branches.
- George?
- Come on.
Oh, my God!
[Native]
- Hello?
- [Native]
- [Native]
- [Native]
Amigos.
[Yelling, Laughing]
George, maybe you should give them something?
- We would like to give you a gift.
- Huh?
What would you like me to give them, Susan?
Show your watch.
Show it.
Show them how it ticks.
It doesn't tick. It's a goddamn digital.
Try it anyway, George.
- You like my watch?
- [Beeping]
[Beeping Continues]
[Beeping]
[Native]
Have any other ideas?
[George] Oh, terrific.
It's a convention.
Maybe they'd like my... pants.
It's what they could use.
[George] Susan!
- Susan! Don't! Their soul!
- It's okay.
It's just a picture.
It's okay.
Come on, it's all right.
[Woman Laughing]
Think happy thoughts.
[Native]
Mmm.
[Gulp]
This is absolute "craporama."
Dead ants. Live ants.
I think I'm going to die.
Ah.
Here, uh, try a little half-eaten hippie food.

- [Whispering]
- [Chuckling]
Mmm.
[Laughing]

I don't like it either, boss.
- I'm George.
- Huh?
- My name, George.
- Cephu.
Cephu, how do you do?
[Native]
[Crying]
You okay?
[Crying]
[Kissing Sound] It's okay.
[Music][Drumbeats]
This I like.
[Native]
What is this stuff anyway?
Near beer.
It's near enough.
[Susan] George?
I feel really strange.
Me too.
[Native] Have you seen this thing?
[Hissing]
George, did you see that?
- What's with him?
- [Drums Stop]
Hey.
- They just disappeared.
- [lndistinct Moan]
- Listen.
- [Moaning Continues]
George, you hear that?
Do you hear that?
[Whispering] That's an elephant or something.
Hello?
Where'd everybody go?
I always like to thank the host of the party before I leave.
Come on, let's set up a tent.
Those guys just disappeared into thin air.
And that sound.
I don't know.
It could have been a hippo, except hippos don't... make a trumpet sound like that.
- Spooky, huh?
- Yeah.
I've never heard anything like it, George.
Whatever it was, it's gone now.
- Now?
- Why not?
'Cause the natives might be outside still.
They can watch.
[Indistinct Rumbling]
It's a little earthquake.
It stopped.
- [Indistinct Noise]
- The wind?
The wind.
Kind of nice how the jungle makes noises at night, isn't it?
Crickets and stuff.
- Yeah.
- [Crickets Stop]
Yeah, not everybody gets to experience this.
It's a marvelous opportunity.
George, you're not sorry you're here, are you?
No, no, no.
Really, Susan, I'm not.
George, I don't know if I'm in the mood anymore. Do you mind?
Oh, come on.

Is this absolutely essential, Colonel?
They are fighting men, Professor.
They need their diversions.
I wish you were looking in an area the government controls.
The natives are scared of the Mokele-Mobembe.
I don't think they'll present any problem.
- You aren't frightened?
- On the contrary, my dear Colonel.
I've been on its trail for far too long.
We're like old friends.
Besides, we have our military escort.
[Gunfire]
- [Rumbling]
- Listen.
Come on.
Oh, George.
Oh, my God!
It's beautiful.
Get down.
The wind's at his back.
He can't get our scent.
I need pictures.
Get my camera.
Quick!
Susan.
[Camera Clicking]
- George, look.
- I see.
- It's the female.
- How do you know?
George, it's a hatchling.
It is.
It really is.
Take pictures.
Take pictures.
We're looking at
150 million years ago. My God.
You realize you're gonna be the most famous scientist in the world?
And you're gonna cover it.
[Camera Clicking]
[Roaring]
They might be great, but I don't know how friendly they are.
[Braying]
[Cooing]
What I don't understand is what they're doing this far south.
What I don't understand is what they're doing alive.
Ready? Maybe they ran out of this fruit where they used to live.
- Think that's enough?
- Yeah, okay.
Following the food supply.
You know, George, that's not bad.
- I guess we can get a little closer.
- You know what we've got to do?
We've got to get them used to us so we can stick one of Kenge's radio chips on them.
Jump back, Jack.
Woo! Look at you! Aah!
- George of the jungle.
- Come on.
- [Growling]
- Chow time.
They're getting used to us.
Great. They love it.
[George]
That's it, guys. Pig out.
[Cooing]
Hey, look. Behind you.
The baby. Terrific.
You can put the transmitter on him.
- Hey! Hey, you! Leave that alone.
- [Braying]
Oh!
Susan, he's got big teeth.
Where'd he go?
[Squawking]
- You see him?
- He's underwater.
On the right.
George? George?
[Screaming]
Here, Baby, it's all right.
It's all right.
God, George, you scared her.
No, no, no, stay here.
- Real funny.
- Come on, it's okay. It's all right.
Some food. Come on.
No, no, wait, wait.
Here, here, here. No, no, come on.
Hungry? Free meal.
That's it. Is it...
Look at you.
Are you friendly?
You like that? Yeah.
Look at these ears.
Wow.
Yeah.
Whoa, don't step on me.
Came to visit us.
Yeah.
She's like a little elephant, isn't she?
It's playing.
Dinosaurs don't play.
- It's weird.
- Isn't her skin nice?
I thought it would be more scaly.
Well, you're not so bad.
You're kind of friendly.
Yeah.
- [Growling]
- What the...
[Eric] Use the tranquilizer gun.
In the neck.
Aim carefully.
[Eric] And another.
In the neck.
[Snarling]
Give it time.

Get back!
Get back!

Have you any idea what you've done?

- No, Professor.
It was one of two.
That is a one-of-a-kind specimen.
Get down! Susan!
- Don't go over there.
- [Moan]
- Shh. Keep her quiet.
- Keep her quiet?
- She's trying to get to her mom.
- Quiet!
Keep her here.
Kiviat, what in the hell are you doing, man?
I was under the impression you were a scientist.
What? You gonna have it stuffed... right here on the spot?
Mr. Loomis, you will kindly keep your mouth shut.
- Secure the creature.
- Yes.
- Don't do it, Nigel.
- Well, I...
- Oh, my God!
- Your prisoner?
We do not take prisoners.
[Rifle Cocking]
Don't! Don't!
Don't!
- Agh!
- Take cover!
- [Shouting]
- Move!
[Gunshots]
Susan!
Run, Susan!
Yeah!
[Native]
Still want to set up your field lab here, Professor?
- We'll have to take her back.

They did a job here, didn't they?
What a mess!
They got the radio.
- The receiver's okay.
- This works.
[Moaning]
Oh, God, George, look!
Doesn't have much of a chance, does he?
She'll never survive without her mother.
Baby, come here.
Baby, Baby, come on.
No, no.
- Come on, Baby. Come on.
- [Kissing Sounds]
- [Growling]
- [Susan] Come on, come on.
Come on.
[Braying]
You know, George, if we caught it, maybe we could beat Eric back.
It could be our discovery.

Don't hurt her.

- Ow! She bit me!
- [Growling]
- [Grunting]
- Hold on to her, George!
- I'm tryin'!
- Hold on!
- Grab her!
Grab her!
[Susan]
I'm trying! I'm trying!
George, hold her back.
It's okay. It's okay.
- Shh.
- [Grunting]
It's okay. Calm down.
It's me, see?
Look, it's me.
Shh, shh.
You'll be okay.
Shh. You'll be okay.
She'll take a bath.
You'll be fine, Baby.
[Cooing]
It's okay.
It's all right. Shh.
[Chanting]
[Growling In Time With The Chanting]
- [Growling]
- Don't do that, idiot!
[Eric] Oh, my God, she's had more than 200 CCs already!
Help me! Help me!
Come on, you blockhead!
Take the rope!
- She'll have to have a stimulant.
- I have it.
Help me up.
Right.
Well done, Nigel.
Really.
You must excuse my assistant, my dear Colonel.
Heat of the moment.
You know, I'm, I'm beginning to take an active interest... in your career and, uh... you know I have the aid of the president.
One day I should like to see you "General" Nsogbu.
For all our sakes, we mustn't lose this one, must we?
Lose one, you keep one.
I call that acceptable losses, Professor.
[Whimpering]
[Moaning]
[Growling]
- [Whimpering]
- What's your problem?
- Are you still hungry?
- [Groaning]
She already ate 200 pounds of of malumbo fruit.
Oh.
Who said you had to make such a pig of yourself, hmm?
You'll be okay.
- Okay?
- [Groan]
[Whining]
[George] Oh...
Get him outta here.
Ow! Get off my toe!
She wants...
- Oh, get off my foot!
- She's not feeling well.
She's just a baby.
It'll be all right.
- Oh, what breath!
- Shh.
[George] Good God!
- Come on, George. Come on!
- Heave, heave!
[Groaning]
George, will you stop fooling around?
Come on. Aah.
She's still hungry.
[George] Why'd they put these so high up?
[Ripping]
Shoot!
There goes my pants!
Wasps! Wasps!
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow!
Ow-ow-ow!
I don't think we're that far from where Kenge dropped us off.
If he waits for us, I think we have a shot at beating Eric.
Nifty. Ow!
- Still hurts, huh?
- Look at the size of this sucker, huh?
[George] Oh, yeah, that feels nice.
- You like that, huh?
- Work your way up right there.
Up, up, now to your left.
Right there.
- [Cooing]
- Yuck!
Come on, Baby.
Come on, come on.
- Not now. Go on, go on.
- No, no, no.
Get outta here.
[Cooing]
Hey, hey, go on.
Get outta here.
- Leave my shirt. Get outta here.
- Out of here.
Play with ya later.
[George]
Come here and plant one on me.
- Oh! Oh!
- Oh!
- French-kissed my nose!
- [Laughing]
- It kissed me.
- No.
- [Whining]
- [Susan] No, Baby, no.
Dragon breath.
Get outta here!
- [Moaning]
- Come here.
[Moaning]
[Moaning]
George, Baby...
Where's Baby?
Baby!
- Oh, God!
- I'm sure she's right around here.
Baby!
Baby!
I don't know how she'll feed herself, George.
She can't reach the malumbo.
We'll just have to keep looking.
- [Beeping]
- Wait a minute.
- I got something here.
- Baby?
- [Beeping]
- Yeah, she's over that way.
[Beeping]
[Helicopter Engine Whirring]
[Susan] It's Eric.
- Do you think they have Baby?
- I don't see her.
Could have gotten the signal from something else over there though.
- [Moaning]
- [Susan] Oh, look at the mother.
- We have to help her.
- What do you suggest?
- We walk in there with a writ?
- We have to try.
[Indistinct Chatter]
Don't you worry.
We'll get you back to your baby.
I can't get these ropes.
You'll have to use your knife.
- [Sniffing]
- I know you miss her. I miss her too.
- She smells Baby on your belt.
- Huh?
You used it for a leash.
- [Growling]
- [Native Shouting]
[Shouting]
[Machine Gun Fire]
- Come on!
- I'm coming.
Halt! Halt!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
They were attempting to steal the people's discovery.
[Native]
It's really great, Eric. Is this paleontology by the books?
Welcome to the People's Army.
- Hey, watch it...
- Hey!
You will stop telling people what to do.
That's a very bad habit you people have got.
You are not a citizen in this country.
You're a criminal and you have no rights.
If that is not clear, we will make it clear! [Native]
- What is the matter with those two?
- They're in a bit of a pickle.
- [Moaning]
- [Native]
[Moaning]
Open up.
So... a brontosaurus hatchling.
Amazing find.
Remarkable object for study.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I... read your notes, my dear.
Your behavioral observations were most impressive.
A little unschooled, but written on the run, I realize that.
You've attached a homing transmitter to the hatchling, have you not?
It can't be too far away.
I think we can track it down.
A hatchling.
That's very dear to me.
I'm going to find it.
You're going to help me, aren't you? Hmm?
Good night.
[Indistinct Chatter]
- [Nigel] Eric. Eric!
- Go away.
No, listen. It's the animal.
Her heartbeat's irregular.
The breathing's impaired.
I told him no more tranquilizers.
All he ever thinks about is being made a general.
Now he's planning to airlift her by crate in a helicopter. She'll never survive it!
Oh, Eric, what are we doing?
Go to bed, Nigel. Sleep. I'll have a chat with the colonel.
[Eric] Colonel!
- May I?
- What is it, Professor?
- More debate about your prize?
- Nothing of the sort.
She's become rather restive and I have just prepared some of this... very special serum but it doesn't fit our instrument.
May I? Please.
Thank you.
This is our... very best stuff.
Guaranteed to reduce her to near death.
Thank you.
And, uh, total immobility.
- Oh, spare me your sarcasm, Professor.
- Certainly.
[Muffled Groaning]
[Native]
Oh, good morning.
What appears to be the problem?
They say that we killed the colonel.
- We found this in their belongings.
- That confirms my suspicions.
- CIA is what they are.
- What are you talking about?
They're trying to prevent us from taking back the people's discovery to the capital.
It's a plot to undermine the revolutionary government.
You're outta your mind.
[Native]
No!
- Oh, my God!
- Don't shoot!
We need them. There's a treasure buried out there.
We can track it on our radio receiver, but we do need them.
- What kind of treasure?
- Gold. CIA.
CIA always has gold. Hidden.
[Whispering] Could be yours.
[Beeping]
I think we're on to it. Lower.
- [Sniffing]
- [Helicopter Engine Whirring]
[Moaning]
[Whimpering]
There it is!
Here! What is this?
- Is that your treasure?
- That, my friend... is the most valuable thing on earth.
But you said gold!
Give me that gun!
Try for the neck.
Don't!
Aaah!
Jump!
Turn back. Turn back!
Hey, babe.
How ya doin', huh?
How ya doin'?
Come on, we gotta go.
Come on, come on!
Let's go, go!
- Let's look for someplace we can hi...!
- George!
What's down there?
There's a cave.
Come on, Susan.
Come on, Baby.
I can't see.
Gotta have light.
I'll make a torch.
- [Engine Whirring]
- Listen. They're landing.
Come on. It's okay.
That's it, Baby.
Come on.
Get a move on, you fellows!
Not so fast.
- [Growling]
- Quiet! Quiet!
George, Susan, show yourselves!
- Shh. Come on.
- [Eric Shouting]
All I require is the hatchling.
- [Screeching]
- What is that?
Oooh! Ah, George!
Oh, they're getting in my hair!
George!
[Growling]
Watch your eyes!
Come on!
[Screeching]
Aaah!
[Rifle Shots]
Don't! You'll hit the animal.
Come on.
[Gasping] Ow!
Oh, my God!
Damn it!
Oh, George. Oh!
The game is over.
Hold this!
Go!
Don't!
[Gasping]
Ohhh!
George!
- Susan!
- George!
- We made it! -
- We made it, all right.
We made it!
[Susan] Where's Baby?
Baby, are you all right?
[Screeching]
[Birds Chirping]
[Twittering]
[Sniffing]
- What's she doing?
- I don't know.
Hey! Hey!
Over there.
[Baby Braying]
Susan! Susan, there's nothing we can do.
[Sniffing, Sad Moaning]
Well, she's alive.
I said that's all I wanted.
That's all we should want.
There, there.
[Growling]
Hello, George and Susan.
I can't see you, but I'm sure you're out there somewhere.
It's better for science that we have the mother and the hatchling.
I'm most profoundly grateful to you.
Take care of yourselves.
Bye-bye.
[Groaning]
I don't know what she sees in these things.
I think I was starting to believe we were her parents.
I didn't do that many drugs in college.
They're probably gonna dope her silly.
A bunch of grad students giving her a physical every ten minutes.
That's what I was gonna do.
But she likes you.
[Native]
[Buzzing]
[Buzzing]
- Mokele-Mobembe.
- Mokele-Mobembe? Come on.
- [Native]
- Hey, you are late!
And guess what I saw downriver?
Your dinosaur!
We steal it back. It won't be easy, but Kenge Obe doesn't worry...
- because it's no problem!
- No problem!
Right!
[Indistinct Chatter]
[Moaning]
How is the little one?
She's just so scared.
I've given her some morphine.
Splendid.
Absolutely splendid.
[Man] Fire!
Get our equipment! Move!
Damn it, move!

Still no Kenge.
We're just gonna have to wait.
Halt! Stand guard.

A train is coming to get me!
Mom! Mom!
So it was a dream.
Nemo, are you all right?
Was he having a bad dream again?
Don't tell me you sneaked a piece of pie again?
All right! lt's the circus parade! lcarus! Come here, lcarus!
Let's go!

You sure are an amusing little fellow.
Dad! Dad!
The circus is in town!
That's nice. . .
Please, take me there!
Please, Dad?
Let's go tomorrow, Nemo.
You always say "tomorrow".
Oh drat! l'm late for my meeting. l must leave.
Tomorrow, l promise. Tomorrow.

Drat. . .
Good night.
Good night, darling.
"Remember your promise"

Where am l?
Listen, Nemo, how many times must l tell you?
What was l doing?
Nemo! Come back at once!
Nemo!
Darling, please have a talk with your son.
He won't listen to me one bit.
Tomorrow. . . l'll talk to him tomorrow. . .
That was a close call. lcarus. Wake up. lcarus!
Look sharp, boys!
The King is coming through!
Attention!
Aye!
Good evening.
Allow me to introduce myself.
Who are you? l am a professor and a genius.
You may call me Professor Genius.
And this is BonBon. l am his assistant!
What do you want with me?
We came here to see you on orders from
Morpheus, the King of Slumberland.
King Morpheus?
Slumberland? lndeed.
Ah, the gift from the Princess.
Wait until the explanations are through.
His Majesty, King Morpheus, ruler of Slumberland, and keeper of all good dreams.
Cordially invites little Nemo on behalf of his daughter, Princess Camille,
To be the royal playmate of Camille in Slumberland
Oh. . . thanks.
Princess Camille grows impatient, we must depart immediately.
W-wait a minute!
This princess is a girl, right? But l've never played with a girl before.
What?
She's not just a girl, she's a princess!
Same thing.
A girl is a girl.
And besides, l've never heard of Slumberland. lndifference over a royal invitation? Unheard of!
Then what about this present?
Present, you say?
Yes! lt is a present from the sweet Princess Camille!
Ooooh, l love presents!
These are delicious dream-sweets made in our special candy factory.
Woah, awesome!
Thanks! l like princesses after all. l like girls, too.
Yummy!
The King wishes you to ride on his private blimp.
A blimp? A real blimp?
Woah, look at that, lcarus! lt's real! And it looks just like my model!
Hi!
His Majesty has ordered your presence and is waiting for you. l'll come! l accept his invitation!
Right, lcarus? l'd better leave Mom a note.
Please hurry. We cannot delay the departure time.
Hurry, the princess is waiting.
Make haste, make haste, Nemo!
Okay!
Farewell, world. Preparations for ascent complete. lcarus, look! Those houses look like models!
This is amazing. We're getting higher and higher.
Well then, this place is. . .
The pilothouse! l know that.
Keep the present altitude and proceed at full speed!
Want to take the wheel, Nemo?
Can l?
Yes, you may. Grab 'hold tight.
Like this?
Yes, that's right.
Yes.
You're good, kid! Keep it up and you'll be an aeronaut someday.
Yahoo!
This feels like aero-acrobatics!
That's Nightmare! lt's Nightmare!
Oh no!
Emergency!
Grab it tight. Keep calm, Nemo.
Engines at full!
Don't worry. We've outrun Nightmare before.
Nightmare is gonna get us! lt's the Crystal Clouds!
Thank goodness. Once we enter those clouds, we will be safe.
Full speed ahead!
Hold on tight, Nemo.
A-are we safe now?
Yes, we are. All safe.
See? We're leaving through the clouds!
Lower the engines, prepare for descent.
Welcome to Slumberland!
So this is Slumberland?
They all know me?
Of course they do!
They all came here to welcome you!
Hello!
Hey, buddy, watch where you're going!
Move it!
Who's that?
Someone you should keep away from.
Hey, how's it goin', kid? Feelin' well?
Come play with me!
Leave that old geezer.
Old geezer, you say? lnsolent fool!
Well, see ya later!
Okay.
Hey, who was that, Professor? lt's Flip, the terrible.
Flip?
Please, son, don't speak that name in my presence again.
Little Nemo, to visit His Majesty!
Majesty,
As per your orders, l have brought this boy to you.
This is Nemo.
Your Majesty?
Ahh, of all the foolishness
Go search in the gardens! l'll search through the palace.
Hurry!
Make haste!
Yes, sir!
W-wait. . .
They're gone.
So you're the kid that was invited here?
What a lucky devil ya are.
You're Flip, aren't you.
Professor says you're "terrible."
S'ppose so. l'm terribly fun and terribly kind.
And l have the power to make your dreams come true.
So, ya wanna see the King, right?
Yes, l do.
Then let me handle that.
Do you really know where he is? l know everything, kid.
After all, l'm the only one here who has a correct map of the entire kingdom.
"Nightmare Land"?
Oh, Slumberland.
C'mon. Let's find the King.
Wait.
Don't worry. We'll probably find the King before the Professor does.
Hey, if that furball doesn't like it, leave 'em behind
No, he's okay. We're coming.
Wow!
Step this way.
Flip!
Everything's upside-down! lndeed it is.
Follow me.
Umph.
This takes a special technique. Watch closely.
Come. Show me what you've got.
Got'cha.
What's that?
Who could it be?
Something's loose. . . ls it this?
No, this one. . .
No, not that one either.
Then where is it wonky? lsn't it the piston gasket?
Ah, that it is. Wrench, please. . .
Wrench.
Screwdriver.
Piston gasket.
Put on the piston gasket and get it in tight. l think you should make it tighter for good measure.
Anything else?
Oil it up.
This is impressive! lt's all better.
You're a good little mechanic.
Guess so. l love trains.
So do l!
Hey, the train is leaving.
Oh, hurry to me!
Ouch.
Are we gonna follow it?
Of course. This way.
Follow me!
Hurry!
Where are we going?
Just hurry!
Oh, we made it just on time. lt's here!
All aboard!
You're the engineer.
Okay. Full speed!
Hey there, Moo-Moo, out of the way!
Train's coming through!
King Morpheus! King Morpheus!
What?
Move it, Professor! lt's been ages since l've had such fun.
Me too!
Ouch.
Your Majesty, l'd like to introduce you to-
We've already met.
"Your Majesty"?
You're the king??
Now, don't be so overly formal.
You can call me Morphy.
"Morphy"?
M-Morphy?
Oh, Morphy, this is my best friend, lcarus.
Well, what a cute little fellow you are.
Now then, Nemo, listen well. l invited you here so that you could become my heir.
Me?
Yes, you.
A prince always bears the mark of the heir. lt is this golden key.
This key has the ability to open any door in Slumberland.
Wow, thanks, Morphy!
However, l must warn you.
There is one door that you must not open. lt is the door that bears this symbol.
Solemnly swear to me, boy,
Promise that you will never open the door that bears this symbol.
Yes. l promise. l promise l won't open it.
Very well.
Now then, Professor, let's have my heir meet the Princess.
Yes, as you wish, your Majesty.
The Princess, eh?
The Rosebud Room. Princess Camellia's room.
The time has arrived.
Now then, let's get you looking your best.
Very good.
Sorry.
Come, Nemo. The Princess is waiting for you.
Listen, be on your best manners. Camellia is a Princess - don't ever forget that.
Princess, please pardon me.
May l please borrow your attention for just a moment?
This is Little Nemo.
"Little Nemo"?
Come.
Welcome.
So this boy is Nemo.
The present, Nemo.
You know, the cookies.
Oh, yeah.
Thank you, er, l mean, for the cookies, Princess Camellia.
You're welcome. l'm glad you liked them.
Good work, Professor, you may leave.
Pardon me. l'll leave you two kids alone.
Professor! Don't leave me. . .
Have fun then.
See you later, Nemo.
Well!
Wh-what?
Nothing in particular. lt's just that you're the first.
The first person to enter a kingdom in his underthings.
Underthings? These aren't my underthings!
They're my pajamas!
Oh. But the royal invitation was supposed to apply exclusively to you.
We did not invite a rat.
A rat?
Yes. Your pet rat. lcarus is not a rat!
And yeah, l'm wearing pajamas! So what's wrong with that?
And whose fault is that anyway? You snatched me from my bed!
You may be a princess and all, but that gives you no right to treat me like this!
What is it?
You're rather amusing.
And you're absolutely right.
Although l invited you l never specified that you dress formally.
And besides. . .
What is it this time?
Your underthings are rather charming.
They're pajamas, l said!
Come, follow me, Nemo.
Hurry. l will show you around Slumberland.
Your rat wants to accompany us, it seems.
He's not a rat.
His name is lcarus.
And call him by name, won't you!
He's my best friend.
Very well. Excuse me. l apologize. lf you're gonna apologize, apologize to the rat, not me.
Er, l mean, l didn't mean. . . lcarus, l didn't mean it.
We're best friends, aren't we? lcarus!
Come down, lcarus. l'm begging you! l'm sorry.
Fine. Then l'll climb up there. lcarus, hold it!
Got'cha!
Nemo!
So his name is lcarus?
Yes.
You are SO precious.
Oh, it's an evening drizzle.
We're having so much fun that the Rain Fairies are jealous.
BonBon! lsn't it pretty? l love this place.
Yes, it's pretty beyond words!
Just in time for lessons.
"Lessons"?
But l hate school. lf you're going to be a prince you need to learn how to act like one.
Step this way.
But what about lcarus? l'll take care of him. Have fun.
Who are these people?
They are all your teachers.
Now, let's begin the lessons.
Sit up straight and let your spoon glide.
We have lunch here at 12:30.
Very nice.
Oh dear.
Next we dance!
En garde!
Advance! Recovery!
Advance! Recovery! Advance! Recovery!
Hey, jump!
"Stand when a lady enters the room."
"Don't spit in front of others."
"Sit up straight."
"Don't yell indoors."
"Open doors for the elderly."
"Don't pick your nose."
Sit up straight! Straight, boy!
More dancing?
Prince lessons ain't easy, eh?
Let's have some pranking lessons too. See there!
They'll come looking for you soon. Wear these.
Ta-daaah.
Flip Jr. is born!
Follow me.
Where are we going?
Just trust me. lt's my house. Home, sweet home.
But it's a police station.
Won't we get caught?
We'll be fine.
Don't worry, l said.
The real fun begins here.
What the?
Why you. . .
Ow! What was that for?
Now you've done it!
Wait, wait, l'll go this way.
Hey, there are two Flips!
Stop, you!
Stop, you!!
This way.
Hey, Flap, wake up!
You've got two passengers. Step on it!
You can do it.
Go!
High in the sky!
Hurry, Flap!
There they are!
Hurry there, boy.
FLY!
Grab ahold, boy.
Sorry, gentlemen.
Let's play again some other time.
Hey, look. Music. lt's an orchestra.
This is it. This is what we call a golden opportunity.
Okay.
Now, it's your turn.
What should l do?
Do this.
Do you understand?
Yes, yes, that's right.
That's very good. You're a natural, kid!
You'll be famous in no time, kid. Just like me.
You're wanted? But why? l was too ingenious for their own good.
Wow, there's lots of towers out here.
That ain't it, boy.
Those're fireworks.
They're all set up to honor you.
Guess it's time for a little rehearsal.
Good idea!
What gorgeous fireworks! Fit for a prince!
Oops. Looks like we got some unwanted attention.
See ya later Flap.
Come, hurry!
Come on, we're going in.
Outsmarting those guys is like taking candy from a baby.
Come, let's go.
Where to?
To an even more amusing place. lt's haunted.
Cut it out, Flip.
This place is kind of creepy.
Don't be scared. The great Flip is with ya. And the real fun begins now.
Woah there. .. Boy! Are ya okay?
Are ya okay? l guess so.
That was quite a spill ya just took.
Look up there.
Looks like you just ran into a big door, kid. l've got a bad feeling about this. l think this is the door the King was telling me about.
What?
He told me not to open the door that has the same symbol as this key.
Let's open it.
But we-
Don't ya wanna know what's inside of it? l'm sure that there's something really, really big on the other side of this door.
Are you sure?
Of course l'm sure.
We'll just take a peek.
What do ya say?
But l promised the king. l swore not to open it.
But l'll keep quiet and he'll never find out.
Just trust me, kid. l guess you're right. . .
A little peek wouldn't hurt.
That's a good boy. l'll give ya a boost.
Hurry and open it, you're heavy, kid! lt's a tough lock.
Well? ls it open?
Look. See that?
Good. Open it.
But.. . we're just taking a peek.
Yeah, l know that.
Don't just stand there, help me.
Oh no!
That was close. l'm leaving. Mommy's calling me!
Flip, wait! l need to take the key out!
Flip, don't go!
Flip! l wonder where that boy went.
The coronation ceremony is about to begin!
His royal highness, King Morpheus!
Prosperity to Slumberland!
My beloved subjects, l welcome you all to my palace for this special ceremony.
The prince can't be late to his own coronation!
Move it, out of the way!
Ah, made it just in time.
Just in time? You're just very late!
And in such tasteless clothes too!
But.. .
No time for excuses!
We can't waste a single second!
Hurry, hurry.
Wait. . .
Don't take my clothes off.
Stop it.
At last he looks like a proper prince.
Calm down. Stay strong.
Come to me.
Oh, l can't stand to watch.
Subjects of Slumberland, allow me to introduce
The worthy heir l have chosen for my throne, Nemo.
As the heir to my throne, he will be henceforth called "Prince Nemo."
He must protect help Slumberland from Nightmare.
And, like this scepter, he is one of a kind.
Bow down to him as you do to me.
Step back.
My heir, behold for yourself the divine powers of my scepter
Jazama Pajama, Pajama Jazama.
Kimera-kazam, imera-tazam.
Paja-paja-jazam
Shazama, pajama, pajama!
Let me warn you all,
The only ones who are able to use this scepter are myself and Prince Nemo.
But he's just a kid. . .
But he is still young and fragile.
This scepter will be bequeathed to Prince Nemo only when he is old enough and strong enough to wield it.
Nemo, the time has arrived. Step forward, my boy. l present you with this crown,
Signifying that you now are in the royal family of Slumberland.
Prince Nemo.
As prince, your duty is to protect the key l gave you and see that no harm comes from it.
Hooray! Hooray!
Let the festivities begin!
Let's dance the night away!
As the king, l cannot let the Professor out-dance me.
Do you not agree, Nemo?
Hold this for me.
Um. . .
Hey.
Doin' fine?
Oh, Flip. . .
That's a pretty thing you've got there. Let me see it.
Don't touch it!
Did you just say something, Nemo?
Eh, uh, nothing really.
Just talking to myself. l shouldn't have opened it. l need to get that key back!
Hold this for me. l'll be right back!
Nemo, where are you going? lcarus! l don't have time to explain.
What's wrong?
King Morpheus!
Please stop the party! Please, stop!
Nemo, did something happen?
Your highness!
King Morpheus!
Want to dance too, lcarus?
Let me through. . . move it, please
Please, let me through!
King Morpheus! lt's Nightmare!
Father!
Nemo, give me the scepter!
Right away!
Nemo, hurry!
Here it is! Take it. . .
Father!
King Morpheus!
Father!
Nightmare. . . how did he get here?
Who opened that door!
He must have done it!
Get him!
Get him now!
But it wasn't me.
Nemo did it.
Flip, what are you saying? l'm sayin' the truth. l saw him do it with my own eyes.
N-no! lt wasn't me! lt was Flip!
But Nemo was the keeper of the key!
Nemo.. .
Nemo?
No! lt-it wasn't me! l-it wasn't!
No. . .
You did it. . . you. . . you.. .
NO!!
So it was a dream. . .
Nemo.. .
King Morpheus?
Where are you?
Nemo.. .
Help me!
Help me, somebody!
King Morpheus. . . l really am sorry.
What's that?
That's it! lt's the Professor.
Professor! lt's Nemo!
This way!
Come this way!
Nemo?
Nemo!
Professor! ls it you?
Take my hand.
Nemo! l thought l'd never see you again.
Where's the king?
Far away.
He was taken away to Nightmare Land.
The entire kingdom is in mourning. lt's all my fault. l did something wrong.
No, it wasn't you.
Flip is at fault.
No. l made a promise to the king.
But l broke that promise. l'll go find the king.
But, without the scepter, there is no hope of you saving him.
The scepter? l've got it right here!
See?
You had it?
Let's deliver it to the king at once! lt's no use.
We don't know where Nightmare Land is.
That's it! Flip has a map.
He does? l saw it.
What horrible timing.
He is about to be banished to outer space!
We need to stop it! Let's be fast!
Row! Row!
Row? Oh, l see. Okay then.
A blindfold? Surely you jest.
Don't make me miss out on the show.
Load the cannon!
What're ya doing?
Let me. . . l'm still smoking!
Hey, lemme out!
Help me! l'll give ya anything.
Help. . .
Ready!
Hurry!
Fire! lcarus! Where did you come from?
Where's Nemo?
Wait! Wait! Hold up!
Don't shoot the cannon!
Nemo! lt's the scepter!
Let Flip free!
What did you say? l'm gonna go find the king.
So you need to let Flip out.
But why?
He has a map to Nightmare Land.
Cancel the sentence!
These're brand label clothes, man!
Now, hand it over, Flip.
Hand over what?
The map to Nightmare Land.
Oh, that thing.
How much are ya willing to pay?
Flip!
Hand it over!
Oh, fine, l get it. You can have it.
Use it well.
Hey, easy, be gentle, man!
Hands off. lsn't it fun?
What's this supposed to mean?
Ah yes, forgot to mention it,
That map doesn't work for just anyone. lt's got a super uncrackable code attached to it.
Then you'll have to come with us.
Me? To Nightmare Land?
Sorry, but l've got errands to run. People to visit.
Prepare the cannon!
Oh fine, l guess l can come along. lf ya make me captain, that is.
After all, l'm the only one who can read the map. ls this lovely princess coming along?
You can hold my cigars for me.
Aww, you look even prettier when you're angry.
Of course l'm coming along.
You are forbidden to smoke while on the voyage!
Anchors aweigh! To Nightmare Land!
Two degrees right.
Aye-aye, Captain!
Watch the aft!
Aye-aye, sir!
Father, l hope you're safe.. .
Don't worry. He'll be okay.
Sail on, fine ship. l am the Captain!
Anything nautical is my specialty.
Owww.
Would you please take this more seriously?
Yes, absolutely, your majestyness.
Er, princess. . .
What's this noise?
Flip! Wake up! You need to take the wheel!
Flip! Help me!
Grab it! Grab on tight!
Are you all okay?
Yes, barely.
Well! My pretty dress is all ruined!
Where are we?
From the looks of things, we're in Nightmare Land.
Really? Ah, yes, of course we are.
See? l brought ya here safe.
Oh no! Looks like goblins!
Those ARE goblins!
Unhand me!
We need to help her!
Pull hard, Professor!
Ah-hah! They were scared of the scepter!
Get away from me!
Flip, the map!
The faster we move, the better. l get it. Hold your horses. . .
What happened, Flip?
Uh, nothing!
The map says. . . this way.
Watch your step. Especially be wary of the goblins. l hate this place. lt looks haunted.
Flip, are there goblins in this forest?
Naw, there ain't any goblins around here.
Which way is Nightmare Castle?
Hey, no peeking!
Just as l thought. Ah, er, this way. lt's a dead end!
Flip! Wonder where he went?
Flip! Flip!
Let's see then. . .
The forest is here.
The swamp is here.
The mountains are here.
And Nightmare Castle is here. . .
No, it's not there. lt's farther north.
Oh, thanks.
Get away, monster!
What's wrong?
Oh dear, we scared him to sleep.
Oh no!
Let Flip go! lt's the scepter! Run for it!
Flip, are you okay?
Yeah, l'm fine.
Wandering off by yourself is dangerous!
You were sneaking in a smoke, weren't you!
Those monsters forced me to smoke against my will.
No, no, we'd never do that. lt wasn't us!
But you ARE goblins.
Stop it, stop it, stop that noise!
Our ears hurt!
Don't do that again!
We're your friends.
We're good goblins.
Are you okay?
We're okay! We're a-okay!
But these guys are goblins!
They attacked me out of nowhere
And they forced me to smoke, l'm telling ya!
We didn't attack him!
And we didn't force him to smoke either!
All we did was help him draw the map!
What?
Er, l. . .
We are shape-shifting good goblins, you see.
Really?
Exactly! l'm Umpu. l'm Umpa. l'm Umpe.
And l'm Umpi!
Well!
One, two, and three!
How silly.
Nightmare is. ..
Very cruel and a liar!
He's so scary that we ran away from him!
But one of our friends is still trapped in the castle.
So we wanna go back and save him.
Nightmare is very frightened of that scepter.
That's why we want you to let us come with you!
Very well.
We know the safest way to get there - we'll guide you.
Not so fast, l'M the guide.
Not anymore. You're fired. l humbly accept your offer.
Yahoo! We got ourselves a good job!
Then what should l do?
You will carry our belongings.
Do you want me to help, Flip?
No thanks. lt may be demeaning, but it's the only job l've got left. l have a question about the spell used with the scepter.
Jazama shazama. . .
No. The second word is "Pajama". l remember that because you made fun of my pajamas.
Not so loud!
Nightmare most likely has spies around these parts.
We need to let Nightmare think that Nemo is very adept at using the scepter.
Yeah, can ya keep it down?
Ya make me carry things during the day, then ya keep me up at night. l've had enough!
A DOG gets better treatment. . .
Nemo! lt's an ambush!
Flip!
Help me!
Nemo.. .
Let me go!
Flip!
This way!
Let me go! l promise l won't smoke again!
Jazama-Pajama!
Dear Princess, l will protect you!
Professor!
Princess! Run away, run away!
Go away! Go away!
Princess! Let her go!
Nemo!
Princess!
Nemo, help me!
Jazama-Pajama!
The scepter!
What a weird dream.
Are you okay, Nemo?
What are you doing here?
We've been here all along.
So l'm still dreaming then?
Dreaming? What's dreaming?
Well, it's. . . l get it! This place is called a "dream"!
Ohhh, l get it.
Exactly, exactly. l thought so all along!
Princess. . .
Jazama-Pajama!
Hey, it's Unpo! lt's Unpo! l thought so all along!
Unpo! Were you okay?
Unpo! l am so happy to see you all again.
Wait, is that your friend you were looking for?
Yes, he's the friend that was left behind. l'm very pleased to see you, l'm Unpo
Hi. l'm Nemo.
So you're Nemo! l have a letter from you, from King Morpheus.
From the King? Where is he right now?
The last time l saw him, he was locked up in Nightmare Castle.
Where's the Princess?
Where's the Professor?
Princess?
Let me see the letter!
Here it is.
This is the spell that goes with the scepter! lt's a secret incantation. When spoken, it releases immeasurable power.
Enough power to defeat Nightmare.
That's wonderful!
But why did the King send me this?
Let's go to Nightmare Castle at once!
The King is waiting for us!
Yay! Nightmare!
Owww, that noise hurts!
Stop making the noise!
Don't scream!
My ears hurt!
Wait, wait, are you saying that if Nemo chants the spell, he'll die?
Oh dear, that is a problem. l'm worried. l was worried all along. lcarus, l'm honored that you're concerned about me.
But the king needs me. l'm sure that the King and the others are all suffering in Nightmare Castle. l need to go save them.
And l want you to come with me, lcarus. l need your help.
Okay?
Then it's decided!
Hurry, to the King!
Let's go! lt's an adventure!
Ah, me too! me too!
Okay, guys, you'll have to navigate me.
You can count on us!
And we're off to Nightmare Castle!
We're off!
Goooo!
To Nightmare Land!
Here it is! Wind Gate!
That's the entrance to Nightmare Land!
So we're finally in Nightmare Land.
Guys, ready? Keep your guard on Nemo!
Single-form transformation. . .
Go!
Hot! So hot! Someone put me out!
Watch out!
What was that thing?
Nemo! Look forward!
Look at that! lt's Nightmare Castle.
Guys! Are you ready?
Hold on tight!
Here we go!
Are you all okay?
Yes, we're okay. . .
Well then, there's supposed to be a secret entrance around here somewhere.
That impudent Nemo and that troublesome scepter,
We have cleanly disposed of them both, my Lord.
You will have full control of Slumberland in time.
All hail Nightmare Land!
There!
What? Nemo is in the castle? And he carries the scepter with him?
You filthy traitor!
Help! We're getting sucked in!
Help me!
What's wrong?
We're being pulled in.
How's it happening? l don't know!
Don't let go!
Where are we? lnside Nightmare Castle.
What was that noise? l'm not sure. l can't see anything.
Maybe we should try coming in again after it's light?
Watch out!
Let's get out!
Run and hide!
Hurry! Hurry! lt's coming!
There's the secret entrance! Hurry! lt's that way!
Ah, that was close. lsn't this a great hiding place?
We built it together.
Even Nightmare doesn't know about it.
He can't see us in here, but we can see him.
Do you seriously think you're well hidden? l know exactly where you are. l think he sees us.
Nope. He's trying to trick you.
Hand over the scepter, Nemo, and l will let you escape.
Answer me!
Now, Nemo, my patience wears thin.
Perhaps this will entice you to change your mind?
Princess! Professor! Flip!
Do you like my collection?
Stop it!
Oh, so that's where you were hiding, Nemo.
Your days are over.
That's right. l have one more item in my collection.
Perhaps this was what you wanted to see most?
King Morpheus!
How horrible!
Your Highness! l have the scepter!
Did you think he would be so easy to rescue?
Nemo!
Hurry! Get him!
Hurry!
Nemo!
Caught him!
There he is!
Nemo! Hurry!
Chant the spell, fast!
Jazama-Pajama,
Pajama-Jazama!
Shimera-Kazam!
Hurry, hurry, we're running out of time!
Ki. . .Kimera-Kazam!
What came after that? lmera-tazam!
Paja-Pajap-Shazama!
Paja. . .umm. . .
Pajap-Shazam!
Shazama-Pajama
Shazama-Pajama!
Oh no! He's coming back!
Now, let's be reasonable.
Hand over the scepter. lf you do, l will send you straight home.
To your Mommy.
Jazama-Pajama!
Pajama-Jazama!... ls that the only part you remember?
Pa. . .Pajama-Pajama
Ooooh, just the sound of the word "pajama" gives me chills.
Nemo! Behind you!
Jazama-Pajama!
Pajama-Jazama!...
Very good, lcarus! Hold on tight.
Shimera-Kazam!
Kimera-Kazam!
Nemo, don't let go!
We've got you!
Kazam. . .Shazama!
We're losing him!
Shazama. . .Pajama. . .lcarus!
Pajama!
Wh-where am l?
Nemo!
Wake up, Nemo!
Please.
Open your eyes!
How horrible!
Nemo!
Your Highness. . . l broke my promise
And l opened that door. l'm truly sorry.
No. . . Your courage defeated Nightmare.
The evil kingdom has fallen.
For all eternity.
Little Nemo, you are a perfect little prince.
Huzzah!
Farewell!
Farewell! Farewell!
Keep being a good prince, Nemo!
Hey, kid!
Flip.
Hey, Nemo, l'm gonna look after Slumberland whenever you're gone.
Jazama-Pajama!
Flip-Flap!
Pajama!
Oh, cut it out.
Flip, what are you doing!
Flip, cut it out.
Help me!
Flip, are you okay?
Flip! An official order from the Prince of Slumberland.
You are never to smoke. Forever! l second that. And we're serious this time!
Fine, fine. Adios! Nemo, my boy!
Take care, Flip!
How beautiful!
Oh, look! That's my town!
Come to me, lcarus.
Nemo.. .
What? l had so much fun.
Thank you. . . Nemo.
M-me too.
Nemo!
Nemo, wake up. lt's breakfast time.
Well! You didn't fall off your bed this morning, l see.
Did you say something?
Well, you have so much fun in store for you today.
Oh, it was all a dream.
A wonderful dream.
Looks that way. l can tell by your smile.
Mom, l'm sorry l broke my promise and took the pie.
Good morning, Nemo.
Get ready right away.
Get ready? For what, Dad?
"Get ready for what"?
We're going to the circus today.
Wanna go, Nemo?
The circus? Really? Can lcarus come, too?
Of course he can.
All right! lcarus, wake up!
We're going to the circus!
What the hell? Guys like me shouldn't dream anyway.
I'm alive.
And the world shines
for me today.
I'm alive.
Suddenly I am here today.
Seems like forever And a day.
Thought I could never
Feel this way.
Is this really me?
I'm alive.
I'm alive.
I'm alive.
And the dawn breaks
across the sky.
I'm alive.
And the sun rises up so high.
Lost in another world Far away.
Never another word Till today.
But what can I say?
I'm alive.
I'm alive.
I'm alive.
Suddenly came the dawn
From the night.
Suddenly I was born Into light.
How can it be real? I'm alive.
I'm alive.
I'm alive.
I'm alive.
And the world shines
for me today.
I'm alive.
Suddenly I am here today.
Seems like forever And a day.
Thought I could never
Feel this way.
Is this really me?
I'm alive.
I'm alive.
I'm alive.
I'm alive.
I'm alive.
I'm alive.
I'm alive.
What the...
Hey, Sonny. Never thought we'd see you back here again.
Yeah. Well, I'm not exactly thrilled about it.
Yeah. You said this place made you crazy.
I decided I'd rather be crazy than hungry.
"The calculation is sensitive to the time you plan to own your house.
"The factor increases if you pay off your mortgage in five years."
Five years?
He'd be lucky if he paid off the movers.
Who could pay off a house in only five years?
Hey, rock stars don't even need that long. They pay cash.
"A million dollars, man? See my manager.
I'm busy, you know."
Last one in, first one home.
Hey, it's Sonny.
It's Michelangelo Malone.
Michelangelo, glad you're here.
The ceiling needs painting.
Uh-huh, all right, that's enough.
Well, the great Sonny Malone returns to AirFlo Records, welcomed by cheering throngs of thousands.
Art world fails to suffer.
News at 11:00.
Cut it out.
You know I wouldn't come back to all this unless I had to.
You know, we were all really pulling for you.
Yeah, you know, like one of us breaking away.
Going out on his own.
Really doing it.
Yeah, no paint by numbers, no assembly line art.
So what happened?
It's what didn't happen.
No bread.
I fought it, that's for sure.
Don't worry.
I spend my whole life painting what other people want.
I paint his van.
I paint somebody else's mural.
I paint Simpson's album covers.
Then when I finally quit to freelance, not only do I almost starve to death, but I can't figure out what I wanna do.
Well, you can try it again.
You will, won't you?
Look who decided to drop in.
Where's your white flag?
You have a way with words,
Simpson. You know that?
Same old wise-ass attitude.
I thought we discussed this on the phone when I decided to take you back.
We did.
But I have one question.
Why the hell did you take me back?
Simple. You're good, and you're the fastest painter around.
But this time no more artsy-craftsy
Sonny Malone touches, huh?
Just enlarge the album cover the way I give it to you.
Am I coming in loud and clear?
Yeah. Good. Here.
You're on your way to your next masterpiece. Get started.
That's great, isn't it?
Picasso only gets to be called a genius.
I get to be called the fastest painter around.
Hey, Sonny, I have this terrific friend.
You interested?
Not right now. Hey.
Mmm, she's great looking.
I think that's this crazy girl
I just ran into.
Yeah? I was walking through the park.
She nearly ran over me, then she kissed me.
Okay, now, let's hear the X-rated version.
What did you do?
Nothing. She took off.
She took off? Come on!
Is this the same Sonny Malone that drives women crazy?
I'm gonna go find out who she is.
You mean right now?
Hey, you're definitely gonna be a successful artist, Malone. You know why?
- Because you're nuts!
- Simpson's gonna kill him.
Listen, Sonny, I told you.
I don't know who she is.
She never filed a W-2 and she never got a check.
And if I never paid her, she just doesn't exist.
What do you mean, she doesn't exist?
I'm looking right at her. She's on the Nine Sisters album.
Not if I didn't pay her, she isn't!
- Down here at me.
- Now look to your right.
Yeah, that's good.
Listen, Sonny,
I don't know who she is.
How can you not know who she is?
You took the picture.
Listen, this sounds strange, but there wasn't supposed to be a model on this cover.
I snapped maybe 100 shots.
In one of them, this girl just jumped into frame.
The next time I saw her was on the contact sheets.
I liked it, so I used it.
That's the whole story.
She just appeared?
No, no, appeared then disappeared.
Now, don't you go spreading this around.
This is one of my best covers.
Why do you want to know who she is, anyway?
I like her.
Hey, Lou. You seen her around here?
No. Pretty. Hey, you're single, right?
Let me show you my daughters.
That's great, Lou. I'm gonna go look where I saw her this morning.
Come on, get your balloons.
Seventy-five cents.
- I'll meet you later.
- All right.
Come on, come on over here.
Hi. Hi.
I'll take one, please.
There you go. See you.
All right, come on now.
Hey, mister.
What are you doing up there?
Hope you don't mind a little noontime music, kid.
A little lunchtime serenade?
I don't mind.
It's kind of nice.
But I was just wondering where they laid out the body.
I mean, you got something a little more upbeat?
Sure.
Better? At least it's faster.
Here, give me a hand, kid.
Sure.
Boy, oh, boy, they sure don't make rocks like they used to.
Want some popcorn?
Yeah, thanks.
You work around here, kid?
Pretty near. I'm over at AirFlo Records.
You in the music business?
What are you? Are you a record producer?
A sound engineer?
No. I'm sort of a painter.
You, you paint at a record business?
Well, not exactly paint. What I do is, I duplicate record covers.
But why?
I make album covers bigger so you can hang them outside record stores.
Promotion. Sounds like an interesting job, huh?
Yeah. Sounds like you should take real long lunch hours.
You got it.
You know, I used to be in the music business, but now I'm what you might call retired.
It's a refined name for "bum."
I don't believe it.
Hey! Hey, wait a minute!
Hey, kid. Hey, wait up!
Where are you going?
Hey, you! Come on! Hold on!
Oh, hi. Listen, I gotta borrow this.
I'll bring it back.
Sure. If you bring it back in person.
You got it.
Hey!
Hey, wait a minute!
Where are you going?
Get that bike off the pier!
Oh, shit!
Whoo!
You're a real Errol Flynn, kid.
What other stunts do you do?
Man, this whole thing is screwing me up.
What whole thing? Ah, nothing.
Come on, have a cup of coffee.
Sometimes the best person to tell something to is a stranger.
Go on. What's on your mind?
Okay.
I run into this girl this morning.
Never saw her before in my life.
She kisses me and disappears.
So what's so weird about that?
What's so weird about that is that 10 minutes later I see her picture on an album cover I'm supposed to paint.
I mean, that's crazy, right?
Well, if I said it sounded crazy, would you stop looking for her?
No. Then why ask?
So I'll keep looking for her.
Okay, kid, but take a tip from me.
What's that?
Don't look underwater anymore.
Thanks a lot.
Hey, Al, where you going?
Hey, Sonny.
It's good to see you, man.
How you doing, Big Al?
How could I go wrong with the great paint job you did on my van?
Hey, and the chicks love it.
Yeah. It's one of the finer examples of my work.
It's beautiful, man.
Where you headed?
East. Where you going? West.
Hang on. I'll give you a ride.
No, that's cool.
Forget it. I owe you one.
All right. Okay, hit it.
Relax and enjoy it, man.
We're taking the scenic route.
Yeah, just don't forget
I'm back here.
Hey, that's the place on the album cover!
Slow down, I wanna get off here.
Here? Thanks for the ride.
Anytime, Sonny.
I've always been in your mind.
You know I will be kind.
I'll be guiding you.
Building your dream.
Has to start now.
There's no other road to take.
You won't make a mistake.
I'll be guiding you.
Wow.
We have to believe
we are magic.
Nothing can stand in our way.
You have to believe
we are magic.
Don't let your aim ever stray.
And if all your hopes survive.
Destiny will arrive.
Bring all your dreams alive.
For you.
Bring all your dreams alive.
For you.
You.
Me.
Hey, I've been asking about you all day.
You may not believe this, but I'm painting an album cover and you're on it.
Why shouldn't I believe it?
Because before today,
I never laid eyes on you.
Now I've seen you three times in one day.
That's a little too coincidental.
Sounds like you don't believe it.
Well, with all that's happened to me today, to tell you the truth,
I don't believe it.
You're right. It's too coincidental.
Someone must be setting us up.
What do you mean?
Hey, wait a minute!
I didn't have anything to do with this!
Really?
Yeah, really, I didn't.
Hey!
Who said I was talking about you?
You come here often?
Yes. I can practice my skating and no one bothers me.
You must live around here then.
Sometimes.
Say, you think we could...
See each other again?
Yeah. Would you like that?
Why?
I don't know. I don't have a very good reason.
I'd just like to see you again.
Where are you?
I don't know where
I'm supposed to look.
Bring all your dreams alive.
For you.
We'll see each other again.
Bye, Sonny.
How'd you know my name?
Hey, wait a minute!
I don't know your name.
Kira.
Kira.
I was in big trouble.
So what did you do about it?
Nothing. Hi, Sonny.
What are you doing here?
It's early.
Yeah, it's really early.
I'm working.
Well, that's wonderful.
Oh, hello there.
Why, do you know you bear a strong resemblance to a fellow by the name of Sonny?
Oh, yeah. He works here.
Always comes in late, though.
Say, that's pretty damn good.
It is. It's too good.
That's what's wrong with it.
It is supposed to look exactly like the album cover I gave you.
Is that too difficult?
If you want me to work,
I'll work.
If you want to stand there and argue, I can get into that, too.
Don't be a wise ass, Malone.
That painting should be done.
What are you wasting all this time on the girl for?
Because that's how she really looks.
I don't give a damn how she really looks.
Just get it finished.
Now, when are you gonna have it done?
Well, I'd say it probably will be done when it's done.
But that's only an approximate guess.
Five minutes, my office.
If it's six, keep walking.
Sonny, what did you do?
Nobody likes it, but we all say yes and then forget it.
It goes with the job.
Four minutes.
What difference does it make?
I'll say it's Tuesday, he'll say it's Wednesday.
So, big deal. Tell him it's Wednesday.
What does it cost?
Oh, nothing.
Maybe just the truth.
Just go in there and agree with him.
That's all he wants.
You want me to say that
Tuesday's Wednesday, right?
Everyday of the week.
Three and a half minutes.
All right!
I'll be right back.
Sit down.
You think you're pretty special around here, don't you?
No. I never said I was special.
Well, you're not.
I mean, you didn't discover art, you know.
Who do you think did that?
I did. Surprises you, doesn't it?
No, not really.
Now, I've got an office,
I make a lot of money, and people respond when I call.
That's because I smartened up and I gave up art.
I think you made the right decision.
I want you to smarten up, too.
Start doing things the company way, not the way you want to do them.
But sometimes I see more in these covers than what's really there.
That's art.
Just paint what you're told to paint.
If you start making changes, then other people start making changes.
And before you know it, you got a lot of people running around, doing what they want to do.
That's not a company.
That's chaos.
Now, I want you to hang some of your precious covers.
Pick up the van and hustle your butt over to the Platinum Palace.
Tuesday's Wednesday.
Hey, clarinet. How you doing?
Hey, what do you say, kid.
What're you doing up there?
Trying to get down.
Grab a hold of the ladder.
Sure.
Hey, if we keep meeting like this, we might as well introduce ourselves.
Sonny Malone. Danny McGuire.
Malone and McGuire.
Sounds like a vaudeville team.
What you got there?
Oh, this is a real gem.
I've been waiting months for it.
Ah, Glenn Miller.
You wouldn't know about him.
He was before your time.
So was Beethoven, but I know who he is.
Do you like Glenn Miller?
Do you like rock and roll?
I love rock and roll.
I love Glenn Miller.
This place is incredible.
It belonged to a silent movie star.
Obviously, they did things big in those days.
What do you do with all this space?
Nothing really.
But I love this room because it makes my records sound great.
Well, I've only got one thing to say.
Remember, I gave you some popcorn.
Okay. But you came here to listen to Glenn Miller.
So, all set up. There he goes.
Nothing like that sound, huh?
That sound was a miracle.
Hey, Danny, that's you.
Yeah.
Hey, this girl...
Danny, there's this girl...
Listen.
That's me.
Hey, that's all right.
You got anymore surprises?
This is what I call my memorabilia room.
Sort of the story of Danny McGuire.
Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman.
You really knew those guys?
Yeah. We used to all hang out together.
After I toured with Miller,
I got my own band and my own club on West 51st Street.
It was small and jam-packed, but everybody who was in town would drop by.
Sometimes they'd sit in for a set or two.
Well, now it's a parking lot.
Why did you give it up?
Oh, it was one of those turning points where you turn in the wrong direction.
It was a girl.
The girl on the album.
Yeah.
The singer with the band.
When she left,
I figured she'd be back, and I wasn't about to run after her, right?
Boy, did I teach her a lesson.
Never saw her again.
After that, the heart went out of my music.
I went into the family construction business and became what they call comfortable.
Three cheers for comfort.
You ever think about going back into music?
No. Only about
20 or 30 times a day.
So, you gonna do it?
Well, I can't play clarinet like I did in the old days.
But you know something, kid? I'd love to open up another joint again.
Why don't you?
I've had real estate agents looking for two years.
They can't find the right place.
Well, if it's just a place you want, that seems pretty easy.
No, it's not easy. It's kind of like falling in love.
You gotta feel a special attachment, a special...
Like you and your friend...
Kira.
Kira.
Hey, why don't you help me look?
Maybe you can come up with something.
Me?
Sure. You've got a good eye.
Stranger things have happened.
Yeah, I guess they have.
Listen, I gotta go.
I understand.
I'll let myself out? Sure.
So long. See you around.
Now how'd that kid figure out about us?
You made me feel so bad
I guess it still shows on me.
You made me sigh for you.
I didn't wanna tell you.
You're getting old, boy.
I'm getting old, babe.
You wouldn't even know me now.
Yes, I do.
But I'd know you.
You know I do.
Give me, give me...
Yes, I'd certainly know you.
You know you've got
the kind of kisses.
But I remember... everything.
That I'd die for.
Oh!
How I remember.
You made me.
Love you.
No other face could
take you off my mind.
You're so refined.
You're much too kind.
I have to warn you.
I'm never gonna set you free
'Cause I was born to.
Love you for eternity.
Whenever you're away from me.
Wherever you go.
You're never far away from me.
I want you to know.
I only have to close
my eyes dear.
And suddenly I'm where you are.
You better never stray
'Cause I'll never be far away.
On every breeze
I seem to hear your name.
My heart's aflame.
I feel the same.
I'd fall apart dear.
If you'd let the feeling end.
Don't break a heart dear.
Nobody else could mend.
Whenever you're away from me.
Wherever you go.
You're never far away from me.
I want you to know.
I only have to close
my eyes dear.
And suddenly I'm where you are.
You better never stray
'Cause I'll never be far away.
You better never stray
'Cause I'll never be far.
Away.
Hello. Hey!
Oh, I'm sorry.
You scared the hell out of me.
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
I tried to be quiet.
How long you been standing there?
Just a few seconds.
Should I go? Oh, no, stay.
You paint beautifully.
This is the first time I've cared about what I've painted in a long time.
That's a shame.
It must be frustrating to waste your talents on things that don't really matter to you.
Yeah.
I met a guy the other day. He told me I should take long lunch hours.
A guy?
Yeah. Someone I met at the beach.
He's got this crazy idea he wants to build a club, and he asked me if I'd help him find a place.
All the real estate agents in this town, he asks me, right.
That's not such a crazy idea.
You've got a good eye.
That's what he said.
If it's a place you want, what about this one?
My place, where we met.
That? Forget it.
I think it has a very special aura about it.
It's a dump!
You're supposed to be an artist.
Use your imagination.
Thanks a lot, I'm all out.
You know, I really think you believe that.
I've had enough for tonight.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Okay.
What's this?
Shh, we gotta be quiet.
I thought we were going skating.
I wanna show you the special studio first.
Only the biggest groups get to record here.
It's really kind of magic. Mmm?
Yeah. They flash all sorts of pictures on screens.
Really? Can we see it?
Straight ahead.
But pictures in a recording studio? Why?
For inspiration.
Oh, inspiration.
Sounds perfect.
I've only watched them do this a couple of times before.
Let's see...
Turn on that one. And this.
I don't know how to make the whole thing work.
Do everything. Go on. Press them all.
I don't wanna break it.
Then press them carefully!
What the hell.
I didn't like the job anyway.
Let's see...
Now will we see the magic?
Sure. Come on.
Careful.
She walks in,
and I'm suddenly a hero.
I'm taken in,
my hopes begin to rise.
Look at me.
Can't you tell
I'd be so thrilled to see.
The message in your eyes.
You make it seem
I'm so close to my dream.
And then suddenly
it's all there.
Suddenly the wheels
are in motion.
And I.
I'm ready to sail any ocean.
Suddenly I don't need
the answers
'Cause I.
I'm ready to take
all my chances with you.
And how can I.
Feel you're all that matters.
I'd rely on anything you say.
I'll take care.
That no illusions shatter.
If you dare to say
what you should say.
You make it seem
I'm so close to my dream.
And then suddenly
it's all there.
Suddenly the wheels
are in motion.
And I.
I'm ready to sail any ocean.
Suddenly I don't need
the answers
'Cause I.
I'm ready to take
all my chances with you.
Why do I feel so alive.
When you're near.
There's no way any hurt.
Can get through.
Longing to spend every moment
of the day.
With you.
With you.
Suddenly the wheels
are in motion.
And I.
I'm ready to sail any ocean.
Suddenly I don't need
the answers
'Cause I.
I'm ready to take
all my chances with you.
Hey! What the hell's going on in here?
Malone! Is that you?
Yes! No, it's not me.
It's somebody else.
Do you have any idea how much this equipment costs? Huh?
Oh, shit!
That was great. You were great.
Our first dance together.
Followed by our first being-kicked-out together.
Now I want to go somewhere else.
Where?
Find out more about you.
You know enough about me.
I wanna know about you.
I'm serious.
So am I.
Well, after all that, do you think you'd let your imagination roam a little?
Look, I won't even start in on that one.
What are you doing?
What do you think you're doing?
Oh, nothing.
Oh. Well, well, well.
Now, what a coincidence.
Look where we just happened to end up.
You think you're real clever, don't you?
Well, I just didn't want you to close your eyes to any possibilities.
You really think this could work out for Danny?
I think this place could be anything you want it to be.
See, it's simple.
Your friend has a dream, and you want to be involved in something you really believe in.
Well, maybe his dream is big enough for the both of you.
So here we are. Someone who believes that dreams come easy, and...
Someone who doesn't know what they believe in.
So just think about it, okay?
Just think about it.
You gotta be kidding.
This place?
They used to have wrestling here.
So it's got a history of success.
It needs some fixing up. I think it could look terrific.
So could the  Titanic.
Kid, you don't need a builder.
You need a demolition team.
Look, I know it's a wreck now, but
I can see it coming to life again.
Just check it out, Danny.
That's all I'm asking.
Well, what put you onto this?
A girl.
Oh, that explains everything.
Hey, Danny, don't you think there's a certain kind of aura about this place?
Well, if that's what you call it, it's got it all right.
Let's see the rest of it.
Of course, it's not small and intimate like my club in New York.
But then again, that was back in
1945 and things are bigger now.
And this place...
Whoo. Sure is big.
Yeah, it is.
Yeah. Well, I don't know.
I don't know.
Naturally, I can't take all this too seriously.
But if I were going to do something about it, and I can't say I am because, you see,
I'm a builder, and a builder has to take his time deciding these things.
But if I were going to do something about it, just speaking hypothetically, it just might work.
You think so?
Might. If I planned it right.
Let's see... Stage over there.
Stairs there and there and back there.
Kid, can you imagine it?
Imagine what?
A bandstand right over there in that corner.
And a big band, like in the '40s.
No, no, no. Bandstands went out with running boards. Over there...
- A great rock and roll band.
- This is the '80s.
Real smooth dancers.
Wild trombone.
The band decked out in tuxedos.
Six guys wearing electric orange.
Synthesizer, heavy percussion, electric guitar.
Lots of glamour. Everybody dressed in elegance and style.
Do it, Daddy, do it.
Yeah, man.
Yes!
Anybody blue.
Anybody needing someone, too.
Anyone feeling cold.
No one there you can hold.
Don't wait to get old and gray.
I'm gonna blow
all the clouds away
'Cause there is nothing
I would rather do.
Forget about the blues
tonight, sweet thing.
Forget about the rules
tonight, sweet thing.
I want to dance with you.
Until the sun comes
creeping through.
I want to dance with you.
I won't stop pleasing you.
Honey, for a while.
Give a girl a chance
to show some style.
If you've got no love to spare.
Tell me lies.
I don't care.
You better believe that I.
I know some moves
that we've gotta try
'Cause there is nothing
I would rather do.
Forget about the blues
tonight, sweet thing.
Forget about the rules
tonight, sweet thing.
I want to dance with you.
Until the sun comes
creeping through.
I want to dance with you.
I won't stop pleasing you.
Lover, I wanna let you know.
I won't take a backseat.
Ain't willing to let you go.
I won't take a backseat.
Don't wanna hear what you want.
It's gotta be all my way.
And I'm making sure
you stay to see.
I'm really a selfish man.
I gotta get right to it.
Lover, tonight
I'm thinking of me.
Lover, I won't take
a backseat tonight.
Lover, getting on my
two feet tonight.
Got some dancing to do.
Got some dancing to do.
Got some dancing to do.
Got some dancing to do.
Can't let anyone dance
with you.
I won't take a backseat.
Let me show you what I can do.
I won't take a backseat.
Ain't funny to fool with me.
I'll be a bad loser.
You're getting me mad,
using me.
Tried putting a spell on me
'Cause I had a strange feeling.
You better get down
to healing me.
Lover, I won't take
a backseat tonight.
Lover, getting on my
two feet tonight.
Got some dancing to do.
Got some dancing to do.
Got some dancing to do.
Got some dancing to do.
Forget about the blues
tonight, sweet thing.
Lover, I won't take
a backseat tonight.
Forget about the rules
tonight, sweet thing.
Lover, getting on my
two feet tonight.
I want to dance with you
Got some dancing to do.
Until the sun comes creeping through Got some dancing to do.
I want to dance with you
Got some dancing to do.
I won't stop pleasing you
Got some dancing to do.
Forget about the blues
tonight, sweet thing.
Lover, I won't take
a backseat tonight.
Forget about the rules
tonight, sweet thing.
Lover, getting on my
two feet tonight.
I want to dance with you
Got some dancing to do.
Until the sun comes creeping through Got some dancing to do.
I want to dance with you
Got some dancing to do.
I won't stop pleasing you
Got some dancing to do
I love it! I'll do it!
Maybe I'm crazy, but what the hell!
I haven't been crazy for over 35 years.
I'm gonna do it. And, kid, I'm giving you half the place.
You're gonna be my partner.
I can't do that, Danny.
I can't take that.
Why?
I don't know the first thing about being a partner.
Well, it's easy. We share the responsibilities and we argue a lot.
It's like being married, without the good part.
Come on, kid. Is it a deal?
Okay. It's a deal.
What do you know!
I'm back in show business.
Now, I can't wait. I gotta look over every inch of this place.
I only wish we could see better.
I got a flashlight in the car.
Will you get it? Yeah.
It's our first collaboration as partners.
And, oh, partner? Partner, what'll we name the place?
Yeah. What the hell to call it?
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan A stately pleasure-dome decree..."
"Where Alph, the sacred river, ran.
"Through caverns measureless to man.
"Down to a sunless sea."
"Down to a sunless sea."
Yes, Xanadu.
I'm Kira. Of course.
You're Kira.
But... But?
I mean... Don't I know you?
I don't think so.
Are you sure because...
Because?
Well, I mean... I don't know.
I was thinking that I...
Oh, I'm sorry. Forget it.
So, you're gonna do it?
Yes, we're gonna do it.
Total insanity.
Only if you think so.
Well, even if it is, it's worth a try.
Xanadu. How do you think that'll look on a marquee?
- Hmm, wonderful.
- Hey!
When did you get here?
Just a minute ago.
What'd I tell you, Danny? One minute she's here, the next minute, who knows?
Guess what you own half of, partner.
What?
Xanadu.
Xanadu. Xanadu.
Hi, guys.
Hey, Picasso. Hey.
How you doing?
Let's see, what's first on the agenda?
- Hey, who are you calling?
- Leave a dime on the counter.
Hello, Simpson? Sonny Malone.
I wanna see you right away.
Hey, what's going on here?
Who cares what's going on. Just get out before he gets here.
Yeah. I'll fix everything up.
I'll tell him it was a joke.
Hey, wait a minute. Relax. It's okay.
Are you loaded?
Because, when you sober up, you're gonna be real sorry.
He should be coming in just about now.
Malone, what the hell is going on?
Simpson, I've worked like a dog trying to make Tuesday Wednesday.
I couldn't do it.
I must be a failure.
Is he straight?
You told me if I didn't do things the right way, I'd be fired.
Well, you were right.
Huh?
I'm fired!
Malone, I want you out of here in five minutes.
That's five minutes, Malone, and if it's six, just keep walking. Got it?
I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
I'm doing it!
You know that dream of mine to get out of here?
Well, it's happening, and you're all invited.
Opening night, whatever you want, it's on the house.
You know, I always wanted to say that line.
Shit.
Okay.
To Xanadu. To dreams.
I couldn't have done it without you.
How is it?
Heavenly.
You're the one that's heavenly.
No, don't.
What's the matter?
Did I do something?
No.
You know, I don't know anything about you.
Where you live, where you were born.
There's nothing to know.
Where do you live?
With my sisters.
Where? In an apartment.
Yeah, but where's the apartment?
On the second floor.
Look, I don't even know how to find you.
Yeah, but you always do. Okay.
That's a dead end.
What's your last name?
Same as my father's and mother's.
Yeah, but what is it? What?
My father's or my mother's?
I don't care. Either one.
Same as mine.
Okay, I get it. No questions.
No questions, no lies.
No questions, no truth either.
Listen, you know enough about me already.
Any more, you're gonna get a headache.
Are you living with somebody?
Yes.
I'm living with my sisters.
I told you already.
Yeah, I know, in an apartment on the second floor.
Why do I say.
Don't walk away.
You'll be the way
you were before.
When you don't want me anymore.
Don't turn around.
Don't ever leave.
A lonely room where empty days.
Are gathering to meet me.
When you're gone.
Gone.
How in the world will I go on?
Don't walk away.
All you gotta do is stay.
Don't walk away.
All you gotta do is stay.
Don't walk away.
Don't walk away.
Don't walk away.
Don't say goodbye.
Don't say goodbye.
Don't turn around.
Don't turn around.
Don't let it die.
Don't let it die.
When shadows fall.
When shadows fall.
When day is done.
When day is done.
All through the night.
All through the night.
All of my life.
All of my life.
Don't walk away.
Don't walk away.
Don't walk away.
Don't say goodbye.
Don't say goodbye.
Don't turn around.
Don't turn around.
Don't let it die.
Don't let it die.
When shadows fall.
When shadows fall.
When day is done.
When day is done.
All through the night.
All right.
Come on, you guys, does anyone want some more?
Hey, hey. Give me a break. It's only the end of the first week.
So what? We're gonna celebrate at the end of every week.
All right. I won't argue with that. Cheers.
Two cheers. Two cheers.
You know, when you guys told me you were building a dream,
I thought you were crazy. Yeah?
Most people want skyscrapers you put up in 20 minutes.
It's gonna be beautiful in there.
Thank you.
All right. See you guys next week.
You bet.
Hey, Sonny, I thought we should have one special toast, just the two of us.
I've never had a partner before.
I've never watched a dream come true.
Hey, there's not much left.
But, still vintage.
Only the best.
To Sonny Malone. Danny McGuire.
And Glenn Miller.
Hello.
How's it all going?
So far so good.
Kira, I want you to promise me one thing.
Anything.
On opening night,
I get the first dance.
Okay. You're gonna dance?
Oh, I've been known to twinkle a toe or two.
Listen, if you're gonna dance, you have to wear something...
That looks special.
You need some...
Glitz.
"Glitz"?
Something sharp looking.
You know, something with a bit of pizzazz to it.
- Hot.
- Oh.
Well, if I need some... Glitz.
...glitz, then I gotta go get some.
Where do you go to get it?
At a franchised glitz dealer.
At a franchised glitz dealer.
Well, wherever it is you go, let's go.
Everybody all around the world.
Gotta tell you
what I just heard.
That there's gonna be a party
all over the world.
I got a message on the radio.
But where it came from
I don't really know.
And I heard these
voices calling.
All over the world.
All over the world.
Everybody got the word.
Everybody, everywhere
is gonna feel it tonight.
Tonight.
Everybody walking
down the street.
Everybody moving to the beat.
They gonna get hot
down in the USA.
New York, Detroit, LA.
We gonna take a trip
across the sea.
Everybody come along with me.
We're gonna hit the nights
down in gay Paris.
See the Duke
Then we'll pick up the team.
All over the world.
Everybody got the word.
Everybody, everywhere
is gonna feel it tonight.
All over the world.
London, Tampa, Hollywood.
New York, Hong Kong, Tokyo.
LA, New York, Amsterdam.
Monte Carlo, China, and then.
All over the world.
Everybody got the word.
Everybody, everywhere
is gonna feel it tonight.
Everybody all around the world.
Gotta tell you what
I just heard.
Everybody walking
down the street.
I know a place where
we all can meet.
Everybody gonna have
a good time.
Everybody will shine
till the daylight.
All over the world.
Everybody got the word.
Everybody, everywhere
is gonna feel it tonight.
All over the world.
Everybody got the word.
All over the world.
Everybody got the word, word
Word, word, word, word, word.
All over the world.
Everybody got the word.
Yeah, that's right.
We're opening tomorrow night.
Well, you can bring your
TV cameras if you like, but we're not gonna do any of that celebrity stuff.
No, no, just people.
Anybody who shows up.
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
So long.
I wonder what would have happened if I got that album to paint?
Don't worry.
Your turn will come.
Everyone gets at least one chance at feeling like that.
Yeah. That's what they say.
That's what I say.
All right, what's next, boss?
Well, we're down to little details. Fountains, yes.
The mirrors, yes. Next, we need those new parking signs.
Oh, the signs are here. We just haven't put them up yet.
Well, come on. Give me a hand.
Let's get them up.
I'll be right back. I wanna talk to you about the sound system.
Sure.
You've made the place look beautiful.
Just did what the kid said.
Oh, I see a little
Danny McGuire here and there.
Oh, just here and there. Don't tell anybody, but I'm nervous.
What about?
Well, I haven't had an opening night since 1945.
Wow! I guess I got the jitters.
Well, just pretend we're back in 1945 all over again.
I don't have to pretend.
It is 1945 all over again.
Well, that takes care of that.
Sonny, don't worry about that sound system.
I looked over it twice today and it's fine.
You kids go on home.
Bye, Danny. 1945.
You did it. Tomorrow's your big day.
It's all gonna come true.
Tomorrow's gonna be the most beautiful day in the world.
Kira.
I love you.
I love you, Sonny.
What's the matter?
All of it, everything.
We can't go on pretending this is for real.
I know, it is hard to believe.
I can't have these kind of feelings.
It's beginning to hurt.
This part of it was never supposed to happen.
I don't understand.
What do you mean, "hurt"?
I know I shouldn't, but I do, and it's crazy.
Sonny, there's something I have to tell you about myself.
I know all I need to know.
No, I have to tell you.
I have no choice.
All I was sent to do was to make Xanadu happen.
I don't get it.
Sonny, you have to believe me when I tell you that I never wanted to hurt you.
That was the last thing
I wanted to happen.
I'm not as I appear to you.
Have you ever heard the expression, "Kissed by a muse"?
That's what I am. I'm a muse.
I'm glad somebody's having a good time.
Please don't make a joke.
I'm serious.
I come from Mount Helicon.
I'm the daughter of Zeus. I have eight sisters.
My real name is...
Are you telling me that's not real?
I'm trying to tell you the truth.
Why don't you believe me?
Look up the word "muse" in the dictionary. Go on.
Page 728. Read it.
Okay. All right, I'll read it.
"Muse. Any of the nine sister..."
Like the album cover?
Hmm.
"Any of the nine sister goddesses in Greek mythology
"presiding over song and poetry and the arts and sciences.
"And do you believe me now,
Sonny?"
How'd you do that?
What's going on?
The television.
Well, well, look who's here.
Who's chasing you this time, Vargas?
The cops? Or the mob?
Don't get smart with me, Nick.
I told you to stay away
from Brenda Trent.
Yes, you did tell me.
What should I do, Sonny?
Dive at him or make a martini?
- What?
- Who you talking to?
Sonny Malone. He doesn't
believe Kira's a muse.
How can you be talking to me?
You're a movie.
I ain't got time
for this, Malone.
Brenda's the only one
that saw me at the racetrack.
Now if the lady says
she's a muse, she's a muse.
Who's that? Brenda!
Kira.
Sonny.
I think he needs a drink.
It's okay.
I'll take care of it. Thanks.
Good luck on the opening
of your joint, kid.
Wish I could be there.
Oh, wow!
Oh, Sonny.
We've been painted by Michelangelo.
Shakespeare's written sonnets about us.
Beethoven's played music for us.
We're not supposed to feel emotion or show any feelings.
Muses are just supposed to inspire.
I fell in love.
You did?
Well, what do you think happened to me?
It was a mistake.
I broke the rules.
Well, now what the hell do we do, huh?
Answer that, muse!
I don't know.
I'm sorry. It just never should have happened.
Well, it did.
I love you, Sonny.
Kira.
I'll love you forever.
I will.
I'll love you forever.
Kira! Wait!
I'll love you forever.
Hey, painter! I've been looking for you.
Where you been?
Here.
Well, how do I look?
Aren't you gonna say anything about my new threads?
Hubba, hubba.
Well, we're gonna miss you tonight.
It won't be any fun without you.
I told you. I can't go.
Xanadu doesn't matter anymore.
What do you mean, it doesn't matter?
How can it not matter?
This was our dream.
Well, wasn't it?
There's no Xanadu
'cause there's no Kira.
She made it real.
So find her! Bring her back!
Dreams die.
No.
No, no, no. Not by themselves.
We kill them.
Now, if you give up, you'll be sitting on that rock
30 years from now, just like I was.
I know how you feel, kid. I felt the same way once. I did.
I didn't know how important love is.
But let me tell you something.
Somehow, somewhere, there's a way to get her!
If she got here, there's a way to get there.
Believe me, kid, it's up to you.
It's up to you.
I see the early glow.
I hear you say hello.
I watch the shadows fall.
I don't see you at all.
It's a lie
I don't believe it's so.
It's a lie.
I see the autumn rain.
Falling on my window pane.
I hear you say goodbye.
I see a tear in your eye.
It's a lie
I don't believe it's so.
It's a lie.
Our love couldn't go wrong.
How could I know.
I was only dreaming.
And now.
Now that you're gone.
I will go on really believing.
I take the fall.
I take the fall.
I see you in a dream.
You turn and start to go.
I call to you once more.
Guess that I'm taking the fall.
It's a lie
I don't believe it's so.
It's a lie.
Our love couldn't go wrong.
How could I know.
I was only dreaming.
And now.
Now that you're gone.
I will go on really believing.
I take the fall.
Kira.
Sonny. How did you get here?
You didn't think I'd let you get away from me, did you?
You'll have to go back.
Okay, I'm ready. Let's go.
I can't go with you, but you have to get out before it's too late.
Too late for what?
Oh, please, you took a big chance coming here.
What's going on here? I'm taking you back with me, Kira.
It can't be done. Nobody's ever taken anyone out of here.
Not in the whole history of...
The whole history.
I'll make them let you go.
Hey, Zeus!
Zeus, you hear me? Oh, God.
I wanna talk to you.
We don't use those
old-fashioned names anymore.
In any case, it's me
you want to speak to.
I've come to get Kira.
She's not leaving!
It's impossible!
That's what you think.
That's what you think.
How'd you know
I was gonna say that?
Put it this way.
I'm a good guesser.
What else do you know?
Everything.
All right, then. You know this.
I'm sticking to this place till hell freezes over.
Sonny!
You'll leave now
and you'll leave without Kira!
Why?  Because other people have dreams.
So send another muse.
You got muses running around all over the place.
One dream, one muse.
Wait... Wait a minute.
Just listen to me, okay?
Kira and I love each other.
Now I don't know how often that happens in this kind of place, but back on Earth, it's pretty rare.
We need to be together.
All right, that's enough.
You're leaving. Kira's staying.
No more discussions.
Those are the rules
and that's all there is to it.
On the other hand, dear, rules were made to be broken.
We'll talk about that later.
Which is later
and which is earlier?
- I keep forgetting.
- Just a minute!
Isn't anyone interested in my feelings?
What do you mean, "feelings"?
Oh, you remember, pet.
We learnt about feelings
in our mortal history class.
Yes, feelings.
I guess that's what you call them.
I've never really had them before.
I've never felt this way about anyone before.
And I've never asked to leave here. Not ever.
Not once in the whole time I've been here.
No, it's true, dear, she hasn't.
Not in all these centuries.
Or is it minutes?
I do keep mixing them up.
Please, can't we just have this one night?
Just one night?
No, no, it's just not possible.
Goodbye, Sonny Malone.
Hey, Kira?
Just one moment?
Goodbye, Sonny.
Kira!
A child and a fool in one.
So sure I could need no one.
My heart always on the run
to nowhere.
Now as you're holding me.
My heart is reminding me.
That now I could never be.
Without you.
But how can our love succeed?
A miracle is what we need.
And so I appeal to you.
To keep me suspended
in time with you.
Don't let this moment die.
I get a feeling
when I'm with you.
None of the rules apply.
But I know for certain
Goodbye is a crime.
So, love, if you need me
Suspend me in time.
Wasted the time away.
Holding our love at bay.
Now I can't last a day.
Without you.
Your smile is a thrill to see.
Your eyes hold me tenderly.
They'll shine in my memory
forever.
But how can our love succeed.
A miracle is what we need.
And so I appeal to you.
To keep me suspended
in time with you.
Don't let this moment die.
I get a feeling
when I'm with you.
None of the rules apply.
But I know for certain
Goodbye is a crime.
So, love, if you need me
Suspend me in time.
In time.
Maybe just one moment, darling.
Well, maybe just
one moment, or forever.
I keep getting them
mixed up, too.
All right, everybody, let's skate!
Let's skate!
Everybody! Come on!
Go!
I don't know yet.
Up!
Hey!
Xanadu!
Xanadu!

A place.
Where nobody dared to go.
The love that we came to know.
They call it Xanadu.
It takes your breath
and it'll leave you blind.
And now.
Open your eyes and see.
What we have made is real.
We are in Xanadu.
A dream of it, we offer you.
A million lights are dancing.
And there you are
A shooting star.
An everlasting world.
And you're here with me
eternally.
Xanadu.
Xanadu.
Now we are here In Xanadu.
Xanadu.
Xanadu.
Xanadu.
Now we are here In Xanadu.
Xanadu
Your neon lights will shine.
For you, Xanadu.
The love.
The echoes of long ago.
You needed the world to know.
They are in Xanadu.
With every breath
you drift away.
The dream.
That came through
a million years.
That lived on through
all the tears.
It came to Xanadu.
The dream you dream
Well, it will happen to you.
A million lights are dancing.
And there you are
A shooting star.
An everlasting love.
And you're here with me
eternally.
Xanadu.
Xanadu.
Now we are here In Xanadu.
Xanadu.

Now we are here In Xanadu.
Xanadu, Xanadu.
Now that I'm here
Now that you're near.
In Xanadu.
Now that I'm here
Now that you're near.
In Xanadu.
Way to go!
Fool.
Whatever you do
you're reminded.
Fool.
Wherever you go
you won't find it.
I'm really down on love
So save all your smiles.
Ooh, I won't be needing
any love for a while.
I'm really down on love
So save all your smiles.
Ooh, I won't be needing
any love for a while.
Fool, fool, fool.
Fool, fool, fool.
Wherever you go you're a loser.
Such a fool.
I want you to know
you're a loser.
I'm really down on love
So save all your smiles.
I won't be needing
any love for a while.
I'm really down on love
So save all your smiles.
Ooh, I won't be needing
any love for a while.
Fool, fool.
I'm sure I should pass
a law laid down.
Declare you will never wear.
Your face in a frown.
Obey or be on your way.
Get on the first stage
out of this town.
There's me and my deputies
So shake it down.
If you don't grin
We will take you in.
So spread some sunshine around.
Obey or be on your way.
Get on the first stage
out of this town.
Xanadu.
Xanadu.
Now we are here In Xanadu.

Now that I'm here
Now that you're near.
In Xanadu.
Now that I'm here
Now that you're near.
In Xanadu.
Xanadu.
You have to believe
we are magic.
Nothing can stand in our way.
You have to believe
we are magic.
Don't let your aim ever stray.
And if all your hopes survive.
Your destiny will arrive.
I'll bring all your
dreams alive.
You doing okay, kid?
Yeah, I'm all right, Danny.
Have a little something.
It'll cheer you up.
Nah, no thanks.
Miss, would you bring my friend a drink?
Thanks.
Wait a minute.
Yes?
I mean, I'd just like to talk to you.
A place.
Where nobody dared to go.
The love that we came to know.
They call it Xanadu.
It takes your breath
And it'll leave you blind.
And now.
Open your eyes and see.
What we have made is real.
We are in Xanadu.
A dream of it we offer you.
A million lights are dancing.
And there you are
A shooting star.
An everlasting love.
And you're here with me

WHY DOES IT HAVE TO
REVOLVE AROUND SEX?
WHY? WHY ARE YOU
SO PERVERTED?
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH SEX.
IT HAS TO DO
WITH THE FACT

NO, NO.

DON'T WORRY.
ALL RIGHT,
IT'S YOUR SCALP.

SOMETHING'S ALWAYS
BOTHERING YOU
WHEN YOU PULL

YOU KNOW,
WHEN TWO PEOPLE
LIVE TOGETHER
FOR 36 YEARS,
THEY DESERVE TO KNOW WHAT THEY
CAN EXPECT FROM ONE ANOTHER.
THAT'S TRUE.
YOU ALWAYS SAID
YOU LIKED ADVENTURE.
OH, BUT THAT WAS TRIPS TO
PENNSYLVANIA, NEW JERSEY.
I'M NOT SO SURE
ABOUT THIS.
OH, THEN WHY DID YOU
PLAY THAT LITTLE GAME
WITH ME TONIGHT?
BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO PACIFY
A FOOLISH OLD MAN?
I DON'T KNOW.
I LOVE YOU,
DEAR WOMAN.
AND I WANT US TO BE
TOGETHER IN THIS LIFE
AS LONG AS NATURE
PERMITS.
THAT'S WHY.
WHAT'S WHY?
BECAUSE YOU'RE
A CHARMER.
WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING ABOUT?
OH, DON'T YOU DARE.

YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO SUSPEND
YOUR NORMAL PATTERNS OF THINKING.
YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE IN
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY.
YOU'RE NOT WORKING WITH THE
YOUNG REPUBLICANS, ARE YOU?
OH, THIS IS INEFFECTIVE.
IKE, COME HERE.
COME HERE.
LOOK AT ME.
IKE,
IT'S ME...
YOUR BEST FRIEND
COLEMAN.
COME AGAIN?
GENA AND I TRIED
THE EXPERIMENT,
BUT IT DIDN'T WORK.
SOMETHING HAPPENED,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT, BUT I
GOT TRAPPED IN THIS BODY
AND I CAN'T GET OUT.
CALL THE HOUSE.
I'M NOT THERE.
I'M HERE.
AND I HAD THIS DREAM.
IT WAS...
NOW WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING
TO MY FRIENDS,
HAVE YOU?
OH, GOD, YOU'RE NOT
LISTENING TO ME.
I'M TIRED.
I'VE HAD A LONG DAY
AT SCHOOL.
WHERE'S COLEMAN?
HE PUT YOU UP TO THIS,
DIDN'T HE?
IKE, REMEMBER WHAT
OSCAR WILDE SAID
ABOUT A CYNIC, 1892?
"NONE OF THIS IS FOLDEROL."
WOULD I KNOW THIS?
WATCH.
COLEMAN COULD HAVE
SHOWED YOU THAT.
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.
REMEMBER THAT STORY YOU TOLD ME ABOUT
THE TWO DANCING FILIPINO GIRLS
ON YOUR FIRST SHORE
LEAVE IN MANILA?
I NEVER BELIEVED YOU,
RIGHT?
- IT'S A TRUE STORY.
- IKE, I'M WILLING TO BELIEVE YOU,
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO BE
WILLING TO BELIEVE ME.
SMUDGE.
CAREFUL, HE BITES.
SMUDGE, SMUDGE,
COME HERE, COME HERE.
COME HERE, COME HERE,
COME HERE, COME HERE.
- HI, SHEILA.
- HOW DID YOU KNOW MY NAME?
I TOLD HIM.
OH. YOU KNOW,
IT'S AMAZING.
THAT DOG
HATES EVERYBODY.
EXCEPT COLEMAN.
- DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE OVERREACTING?
- NO, I DON'T.
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS THINK YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO GIVE IN TO A MAN?
LOOK WHERE IT GOT YOU.
I DIDN'T DO SO BADLY.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ALL THIS?
MOM, YOU DID EVERYTHING
TO PLEASE DADDY.
SO WHAT DID HE DO?
HE TOOK YOU FOR GRANTED
AND LEFT YOU
FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.
APPARENTLY
IT WASN'T ENOUGH.
I COULD HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE WARMER.
ALL I KNOW IS JOEL'S ONE OF THE FEW BOYS IN THIS TOWN WITH A REAL FUTURE.
HIS PARENTS ARE
DOING QUITE WELL.
HE'S A LITTLE ROUGH
AROUND THE EDGES,
BUT HE'S SMART AND HE'LL
GO ON TO COLLEGE.
MOM, I'M IN
HIGH SCHOOL.
SO JOEL'S TERRIFIC, BUT
IS THAT ANY REASON TO...?
TO WHAT? DON'T PUT
WORDS IN MY MOUTH.
NO, JUST THOUGHTS
IN MY HEAD.
DON'T TURN YOUR BACK
ON ME, YOUNG LADY.
- HI, KELLER.
- HELLO, LAINIE.
DO YOU HAVE TIME
TO TALK?
WELL, BOBBY,
IT'S A SHAME YOU DIDN'T
KNOCK SOME SENSE INTO HER.
HI, MISS DIAMOND.
BOBBY, I'M NOT
IN A VERY GOOD MOOD.
IN THAT CASE, MAYBE
YOU SHOULD COME BACK
WHEN HER TEENAGE YEARS
ARE OVER.
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?
TO RUN AWAY FROM HOME
AND BECOME A PROSTITUTE.
OH, THEN THIS
MUST BE YOUR...
MOTHER, DON'T.
BYE, MISS DIAMOND.
HEY, I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR DOING THIS.
ANYTHING TO GET AWAY
FROM MY MOTHER.
GEE, THANKS.
I'M FLATTERED.
THAT WAS SARCASTIC?
NO, I'M JUST TRYING
TO BE MYSELF.
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WANTED TO TALK.
COME ON, I WANT
TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

THEY'RE OUT OF TOWN.
BESIDES, I THINK IT'S
A NICE PLACE TO COME,

HELLO.
OH, HI, JOEL.
I REALLY CAN'T TALK
RIGHT NOW, OKAY?
GOOD NIGHT.
SWEET DREAMS.
OH, NO, IT'S YOU.
YOU WERE EXPECTING
MAYBE FREDDY KRUEGER?
WHO'S FREDDY KRUEGER?
IT'S BEFORE YOUR TIME.
LISTEN, WHY DON'T YOU
DO ME A FAVOR
AND STAY OUT OF MY LIFE,
ALL RIGHT, POPS?
NOTHING WOULD GIVE ME
GREATER PLEASURE.
WHERE'S GENA?
AND DON'T CALL ME "POPS."
GENA'S IN THE HOUSE, POPS.
DON'T TRY THE DOOR.
IT'S LOCKED.
- I'VE GOT A KEY.
- IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.
THIS IS A DREAM.
YOU WANT TO SEE HER...
GO LOOK IN THE WINDOW.
GENA.
GENA, GENA.
WHY DOESN'T SHE
REMEMBER ME?
WELL, THE WAY I SEE IT
IS THAT SHE WASN'T
AS INTO THIS LITTLE
EXPERIMENT AS YOU WERE.
YOU WOULDN'T BY ANY CHANCE
KNOW HOW TO SWITCH US BACK?
ABSOLUTELY.
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
IT JUST SO HAPPENS
TO BE ONE OF THE VERY FIRST
THINGS THAT I LEARNED ABOUT.
WELL, THEN LET'S
DO IT NOW.
- HUH-UH.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, HUH-UH?
WELL, WHICH ONE DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND...
HUH OR UH?
THE WHOLE IDEA.
YOU SEE,
I LIKE IT HERE.
IT'S...
WELL, IT'S DREAMY.
IF YOU CATCH MY DRIFT.
HA HA.
DON'T YOU WANT TO GET BACK
TO YOUR OWN LIFE?
NO, I DON'T,
AS A MATTER OF FACT.
SEE, YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND.
MY PARENTS HATE ME.
I'M FLUNKING EVERY GRADE IN SCHOOL.
DUMAS WANTS TO KICK MY ASS.
AND IF JOEL FOUND OUT
HOW I FEEL ABOUT LAINIE, HE'D
WANT TO KICK MY ASS TOO.
"SHOW ME A MAN WHO HAS
ENJOYED HIS SCHOOL DAYS
AND I'LL SHOW YOU
A BULLY AND A BORE"...
ROBERT MORLEY, 1958.
UP YOURS AND THE HORSE
YOU RODE IN ON.
THAT ISN'T A HORSE.
THAT'S A SHEEP.
WHERE DID IT
COME FROM?
A SHEEP?
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT THIS IS YOUR
SICK DREAM,
AND I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING...
YOU HAVE SOME
DEEP-SEATED PSYCHOLOGICAL
PROBLEMS, MAN.
AND BY THE WAY,
I'M NOT GOING BACK.
WHAT IF I FIXED
EVERYTHING?
OH, AND HOW ARE YOU
GONNA DO THAT, POPS?
DON'T CALL ME "POPS."
I CAN DO IT.
I'VE GOT TO.
WELL, YOU'D BETTER
WORK FAST,
BECAUSE THEY'RE WORKING FAST.
- NOT AS FAST AS I CAN.
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.
BUT JUST DON'T LET JOEL
FIND OUT ABOUT IT,
OR HE'S GONNA "TEAR
YOUR PLAYHOUSE DOWN"...
PAUL YOUNG, 1986.
SEE HOW ANNOYING THAT IS?
ANYWAY, YOU GOTTA DO ME
SOME THINGS.
YOU GOTTA STOP EATING
THE TOFU SHIT,
BECAUSE THE TOFU SHIT
IS DRIVING ME CRAZY.
IT'S MAKING ME
REALLY NAUSEOUS.
AND, YOU KNOW, YOU GOTTA STOP
TELLING PEOPLE WHAT TO EAT.
IT'S JUST NOT LIKE ME.
HOW OFTEN DO YOU SEE ME
TELLING PEOPLE WHAT TO EAT?
I DON'T DO IT.
OKAY, SOMETHING ELSE...
THERE'S SOME HOME MOVIES DOWNSTAIRS.
WATCH THEM. LEARN HOW TO
SPEAK LIKE A NORMAL PERSON.
I DON'T TALK LIKE THAT.
OH, ALSO SOME MOUSSE...
THERE'S SOME MOUSSE IN THE BATHROOM.
YOU GOTTA USE THE MOUSSE.
YOU GOTTA DO SOMETHING WITH MY HAIR.
MY HAIR LOOKS LIKE SHIT.
I NEVER HAVE MY HAIR LOOK LIKE SHIT.
THEY'RE GONNA KNOW SOMETHING'S UP,
SOMETHING'S WEIRD HERE. ALL
RIGHT, OH, ONE LAST THING...
WAKE UP.
OR "YOU'RE GONNA LOSE THAT GIRL"...
BEATLES, 1965. HEH.

HEY, BABE,
I JUST WANTED TO FILL YOU

I WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT I
WAS NOT A COOL DUDE, RIGHT?
AND ALSO, LIKE,
I WAS TOTALLY UNCHILLED
AND, YOU KNOW, I SHOULD REALLY
CHILL OUT SOME MORE. RIGHT? RIGHT?
WHY CAN'T YOU SPEAK
LIKE A NORMAL PERSON?
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THEY DON'T HAVE A DOG.
THEY NEVER HAD A DOG.
I DON'T APPRECIATE YOU HITTING ON ME
AND I DON'T THINK YOUR BEST FRIEND WOULD EITHER.
SO WHY DON'T YOU GO AWAY?
LAINIE, I DON'T THINK YOU SEE
WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO HERE.
I JUST WANT TO BE
FRIENDS WITH YOU.
I WANT YOU TO GET
TO KNOW ME AS A PERSON.
ALL YOU KNOW ME IS,
IS KELLER.
I THOUGHT I KNEW YOU,
BOBBY, OKAY?
AND I DO LIKE YOU,
BUT NOT IN THAT WAY.
OKAY, FINE.
WILL YOU DO ME A FAVOR AND MEET ME

DO I HAVE A CHOICE?
NO.
SO HOW DO YOU WANT
TO START THIS?
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
HERE BEFORE?
OF COURSE NOT.
WE'RE THE ONLY ONES HERE UNDER 50.
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU
AND OLD PEOPLE ANYWAY?
I'M GONNA TELL YOU
THE TRUTH ABOUT THAT.
WELL, THAT'LL BE
A FIRST.
HOW DO YOU KNOW?
WE HARDLY EVER TALK TO EACH OTHER.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M SORRY. THAT'S NOT FAIR.
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE NEVER DID TALK TO EACH OTHER BEFORE.
ALL OF A SUDDEN
YOU'VE CHANGED.
WHY?
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.
LISTEN,
SOMETHING HAPPENED
TO THOSE OLD PEOPLE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHERE ARE THEY ANYWAY?
I DON'T KNOW.
EVER SINCE YOU AND I HAD OUR ACCIDENT,
THEY HAVEN'T
BEEN THERE.
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE GONE.
AND I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT THEM.
THAT'S PRETTY WEIRD,
HUH?
YEAH, LIKE YOU.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA HAVE?
I HAVEN'T GOT ALL DAY.
HI, MARGE.
LADIES FIRST.
DO YOU HAVE
A RAW VEGETABLE PLATE?
WHAT MADE YOU
ORDER THAT?
I'M ON A DIET.
DO YOU?
ALL I'VE GOT IS THE REST OF THE
SQUASH WE KEEP FOR MR. ETTINGER.
YOU WANT SOME SEVEN-GRAIN
BREAD WITH THAT?
WE'VE GOT LOTS
OF THAT TOO.
OKAY, LISTEN, IF I TAKE
YOU SOMEPLACE ELSE
WHERE NOTHING WEIRD
HAPPENS,
WILL YOU COME
WITH ME?

ANYWAY, JOEL GAVE ME
A LOT OF ATTENTION
WHEN I NEEDED IT.
WHY AM I TELLING YOU
MY LIFE'S STORY?
BECAUSE I'M A GOOD
LISTENER.
YEAH, YOU ARE.
SO YOUR DAD LET YOU
BORROW HIS CAR?
I THINK IT'S NEAT.
YEAH.
NOW WHAT ABOUT JOEL?
DO YOU LOVE HIM?
I'M IN HIGH SCHOOL.

- YOU DIDN'T ANSWER MY QUESTION.

YOU STILL DIDN'T

WHAT ELSE

I FEEL SO SAFE

I KNOW.
WHY?
BECAUSE WE'RE THEM.
WE'RE WHO?
WE'RE THE OLD COUPLE.
YOU'RE GENA AND I'M COLEMAN.
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?
YOU'RE SPOILING EVERYTHING.
IT'S THE TRUTH.
YOU'VE GOT TO HEAR ME, PLEASE.
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOU. I'M STARTING
TO LIKE YOU. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THIS.
- BUT YOU'VE GOT TO. IT'S THE TRUTH.
- BOBBY.
- LISTEN TO ME.
- WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?
- YOU WERE RIDING YOUR BIKE AND I WAS RUNNING, OKAY?
- OH, MY GOD.
- AND...
- BOBBY KELLER, YOU'RE A JERK...
A REAL JERK.
NO, LAINIE,
I'M JUST DOING THIS
BECAUSE I WANTED TO LIVE
A LONGER LIFE WITH YOU.
COME ON.
GENA, COME BACK.
MY FAULT.
YOU ARE IN THE WRONG PLACE, BOBBY BOY.
OH, MY GOD.
SO NOW IT'S JUST YOU
AND ME AND MY BOYS.
- LAINIE!
- BOBBY!
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT
ABOUT THAT.
AND I DON'T GIVE
A SHIT ABOUT YOU.
STOP IT!
STOP IT. STOP IT.
YOU'RE KILLING HIM.
NAH,
I THINK I'D RATHER
JACK OFF.
AND YOU...
YOU'RE GONNA LOOK REALLY
GOOD FOR THE DANCE, CUPCAKE.
BOBBY.
LET'S GO, DUDE.
BOBBY, ARE YOU OKAY?
ARE YOU OKAY?
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.
WELL, THANK YOU
FOR A FRIGHTENING,
CONFUSING, STRANGE
AND DANGEROUS TIME.
WHAT MORE COULD
A GIRL ASK FOR?
I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD
APOLOGIZE TO YOU,
BUT I TOLD
THE TRUTH.
BOBBY, I REALLY
LIKE YOU,
BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE A STORY LIKE THIS.
IT'S JUST NOT FAIR.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT ISN'T FAIR.
YOU SHOULD LET YOUR MOTHER
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT EYE.
LISTEN, CAN YOU
DO ME A FAVOR?
WHEN YOU DREAM TONIGHT,
REMEMBER IT FOR ME.
WHY? AM I GONNA DREAM
THAT WE'RE MARRIED?
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE I'M CRAZY.
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
AND IF I AM, I NEED
SOME SERIOUS HELP.
BUT IF I'M NOT,
YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER
THIS DREAM, PLEASE.
JUST DO IT FOR ME, PLEASE.
PLEASE.
I GOTTA GO.
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.
DEAD MEAT.
DEAD MEAT.
WE'RE GONNA KILL
DUMAS FOR THIS.
- HEY, BE CAREFUL.
- DON'T TOUCH ME.
- HI, MISS DIAMOND.
- WELL, IF YOU AREN'T A SIGHT FOR SORE EYES.
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY...
OUT OF SIGHT, OUT OF MIND.
THANK YOU, MOTHER.
WE'LL BE FINE.
YOU CAN GO NOW.
BOBBY, YOU KNOW,
JOEL'S GONNA FIND OUT
ABOUT YOU AND LAINIE
MONDAY MORNING AT SCHOOL.
HEY, I TRIED TO WARN YOU.
DID YOU LISTEN? NO.
YEAH, WELL, HOPEFULLY I
WON'T BE IN SCHOOL MONDAY.
THAT'S A REAL GOOD IDEA, PAL...
REAL GOOD.
BOBBY, LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION.
DO YOU REALLY, HONESTLY
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING?
NO, NO, NO, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
FORGET I ASKED.
YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T.
YOU KEEP PROVING IT
TO ME.
LISTEN, DINGER,
I JUST WANT TO SAY
THAT, YOU KNOW,
I APPRECIATE US BEING
FRIENDS AND EVERYTHING
AND YOU HELPING ME
THROUGH THIS.
I GOT IT.
YOU WANT MONEY.
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT,
RIGHT... MONEY?
NO, NO, NOT AT ALL.
I JUST WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW
I APPRECIATE
YOU BEING MY FRIEND.
BOBBY.
YEAH?
DUDE, ARE YOU TURNING FAG ON ME OR WHAT?
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
WHAT'S WRONG?
WHERE WERE YOU?
AT THE GYM.
I'M WORKING ON SOMETHING.
OH, YEAH?
I WENT THERE LOOKING FOR YOU, LAINIE.
OH.
LOOK, LISTEN, I'M TRYING TO BE
COOL ABOUT THIS, ALL RIGHT?
BUT YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING
BEHIND MY BACK.
DO I HAVE TO FIND OUT
FOR MYSELF?
I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T
WANT TO DO THIS TO YOU.
IT'S JUST...
I JUST DON'T KNOW ABOUT ANYTHING ANYMORE.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO...
WAIT ON YOU TO FIGURE THINGS OUT?
I MEAN,
GOD DAMN IT, LAINIE!
I'M SORRY, JOEL.
I JUST CAN'T TALK
ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW.
LOOK, I'LL MEET YOU
TOMORROW AT THE DANCE, OKAY?
I'LL BE READY THEN.
I PROMISE.
GREAT. GREAT. WELL, LISTEN, YOU'D
BETTER STRAIGHTEN YOUR ACT OUT BY THEN,
'CAUSE I'M NOT GONNA WAIT
AROUND FOR YOU TO GROW UP.
NOW COME HERE.
ALL RIGHT, GOOD.
SO WHAT DID YOU TELL
GARSON AND SHEILA?
WELL, I TOLD THEM I'D SIGNED
UP AT THE BRIDGE CLUB
TO BE A SURROGATE
GRANDFATHER
FOR KIDS THAT
DON'T HAVE ONE...
YOU KNOW, BIG GRANDPAS
OF AMERICA.
DO YOU FIND IT
AMUSING?
OH, I THINK IT'S
GREAT, ACTUALLY.
WELL, THERE'S NOTHING FUNNY
ABOUT THIS, COLEMAN.
OH, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
AS A MATTER OF FACT, THERE'S A
LOT OF FUNNY THINGS ABOUT THIS.
FOR INSTANCE, I HAPPEN TO BE DATING
MY BEST FRIEND'S GIRLFRIEND;
I'VE GOTTEN IN TWO
FIGHTS IN TWO DAYS.
I MEAN, LOOK AT MY FACE.
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
JUST LOOKS LIKE A BAD
CASE OF ACNE TO ME.
THAT WAS A GOOD ONE,
IKE.
I'M IMPRESSED.
I'M VERY IMPRESSED.
BUT SERIOUSLY,
NOW I GOTTA GO HOME
AND GET SHIT FROM MY PARENTS
FOR BEING LATE AGAIN.
AND THE TEACHING
AT THAT SCHOOL
HAS DECLINED FASTER THAN
THE WESTERN CIVILIZATION.
IT'S RIDICULOUS. THEY DON'T TEACH YOU
ANYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ANYMORE.
THEY TEACH YOU NOTHING
THAT'S SPIRITUAL OR UPLIFTING.
NOT AS EASY
AS YOU THOUGHT, HUH?
HEY, WILL YOU DO ME
A FAVOR, PAL?
CUT ME SOME SLACK.
- CUT YOU SOME SLACK?
- YEAH.
- LAINIE.
- NOT NOW, MOTHER.
DON'T YOU THINK
YOU SHOULD TELL HIM?
TELL HIM WHAT?
THERE'S NOTHING TO TELL.
I THINK YOU'RE MAKING
A BIG MISTAKE.
WHAT'S HAPPENING
TO YOU, LAINIE?
AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE CAR.
I'LL GET THAT FIXED.
COLEMAN.
YEAH?
HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT HOW
YOU'RE GONNA GET BACK YET?
I GUESS I'M GONNA HAVE TO
REPEAT THE EXPERIMENT.
IT'LL WORK.
DON'T WORRY.
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.
WHAT ARE
BIG GRANDPAS FOR?
I MEAN, WHAT THE HELL
DOES HE STUDY?
YOU GOTTA...
YOU GOTTA TELL HIM
THAT IF HE FLUNKS THAT S.A.T.
TEST, THAT WE'RE GONNA BE...
GUS, YOU CAN'T FLUNK
THAT KIND OF A TEST.
HE'LL FIND A WAY. COME ON.
I MEAN, IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING.
IF HE DOESN'T
GET INTO COLLEGE...
- LOOK AT THIS.
- OH.
CAN YOU IMAGINE
WHAT HE'S DONE NOW?
ASK HIM IF THE POLICE
ARE VERY FAR BEHIND HIM.
IT'S THOSE NO-GOOD
FRIENDS OF HIS.
THE POLICE ARE NOT BEHIND ME.
AND IT'S NOT MY FRIENDS, OKAY?
MY FRIENDS WOULDN'T
BEAT ME UP LIKE THIS.
ASK HIM IF I'M GONNA
GET SUED.
CHECK OUT IF HE'S GOT
ANY TEETH LEFT.
I CAN'T AFFORD
THE DENTAL BILLS.
YOU KNOW, IT'S NO WONDER
I'M SO SCREWED UP.
I MEAN, LOOK AT YOU GUYS.
YOU DON'T EVEN TALK TO ME.
I'M YOUR SON, REMEMBER?
WHY DON'T YOU EVER GIVE ME
THE BENEFIT OF A DOUBT?
YOU DON'T EVEN ASK ME
IF ANYTHING'S WRONG.
YOU DON'T EVEN
ASK ME IF I'M HURT.
I MEAN, WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE A KID
IN TODAY'S SOCIETY.
I'M TRYING MY HARDEST.
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY I SCREAMED.
IT'S JUST
REALLY UPSETTING.
I TRY TO DO
EVERYTHING I CAN.
AND I'M STUDYING HARD.
AND I'M GONNA DO GOOD ON MY S.A.T.s
ON SATURDAY. I'M GOING TO.
YEAH, SURE.
I MEAN, I'M WORKING
REALLY HARD.
I JUST NEED YOU
TO HELP ME.
I CANNOT DO THIS
WITHOUT YOU.
OKAY.
OKAY.

YOU'VE GOT TO SHOW ME
HOW TO MAKE THE SWITCH.
NO WAY.
BUT WE'RE GETTING THINGS
STRAIGHTENED OUT.
I'M GONNA GET YOU
INTO COLLEGE.
YOU'LL HAVE A FUTURE.
AND LAINIE'S A TERRIFIC GIRL.
EVERYTHING'S GOING FINE.
YOU DON'T THINK THAT I SEE THE
WAY YOU'VE SCREWED THINGS UP?
YOU SCREWED MY LIFE UP
WORSE THAN I DID.
YOU JUST DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO GO THROUGH LIFE IN TODAY'S WORLD WITH A KID'S EMOTION.
YEAN, YOU'RE RIGHT.
MAYBE I DON'T.
I MAKE A LOUSY KID.
I'M TOO CAUTIOUS.
I LACK SPONTANEITY.
I WOULDN'T DARE TO HANG MY ASS OUT OF
A WINDOW AND MOON A LOT OF STRANGERS
OR THROW UP
IN THE BACKSEAT OF A CAR.
IT'S YOUR LIFE.
YOU HAVE TO LIVE IT.
NOT ANYMORE,
THANKS TO YOU.
WHERE'S GENA?
I SAW HER IN THE HOUSE
A FEW MINUTES AGO,
TAKING CARE OF SOME LAST-MINUTE THINGS.
GENA'S TRYING TO TELL
LAINIE WHAT HAPPENED.
I STILL HAVE
A CHANCE.
NOT WITHOUT ME,
YOU DON'T.
AND YOU WON'T
EVEN HELP ME?
I CAN'T.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
IT'S NOT GONNA BE IN MY
BEST INTERESTS TO HELP YOU.
I CAN DO ONE THING... I CAN GIVE YOU A HINT.
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH STATES AND SYSTEMS
AND ALL THAT SHIT.
SECONDLY, IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH PHYSICS.
AND ALSO, IF YOU WEREN'T
SO DAMNED SMART,
YOU WOULD HAVE FIGURED THIS
WHOLE THING OUT TWO DREAMS AGO.
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY, POPS.
HEY,
AREN'T YOU GONNA TELL ME
NOT TO CALL YOU "POPS"?
WHEW. WOW.
I GUESS THAT'S IT.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
I'M HISTORY.
KEEP DREAMING.
LAST DAY, POPS. GOOD LUCK.
HEH!
ALL RIGHT, PENCILS UP.
GOOD MORNING.
WELCOME TO THE SCHOLASTIC
APTITUDE TEST.
REMEMBER DURING THE TEST
TO REMAIN IN YOUR SEATS
AND LET THERE BE
ABSOLUTELY NO TALKING.
THIS TEST IS TO DETERMINE
YOUR ABILITY
TO GET INTO COLLEGE.
SOME OF YOU
I DON'T THINK WILL MAKE IT.
IT IS NOW 10:07.
YOU HAVE UNTIL 1:07.
AND YOU MAY OPEN
YOUR TEST BOOKS...
NOW!
HEY, MR. PATTISON,
LISTEN.
SOME OF THE QUESTIONS IN THE
TEST WERE WRONG ON THEIR FACE,
SO I WENT AHEAD
AND CORRECTED THEM.
THEY'RE IN THE TEXTBOOK,
SO TAKE A LOOK, OKAY?
THANKS.
HEY, I ADMIT I DREAMED ABOUT
THE OLD COUPLE LAST NIGHT.
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO ABOUT IT?
I MEAN, THIS DOESN'T MEAN
YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU KNOW.
AND HOW DO YOU
EXPLAIN THE DREAM?
A STRONG POWER OF SUGGESTION
PLANTED IN A TENDER YOUNG MIND
BY A CLEVER YOUNG MAN WITH A NOVEL
APPROACH TO STEALING HIS FRIEND'S GIRL.
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S NOT AT ALL WHAT
I'M DOING, BUT IS IT WORKING?
IN A WAY.
THIS IS A BIZARRE COURTSHIP.
YES, IT'S VERY
STRANGE.
BUT LET'S PUT ALL THAT ASIDE.
LET'S GET BACK TO THE ARGUING.
WHAT AM I GONNA DO
WITH YOU?
I WOULD SAY
WE SHOULD GET MARRIED,
BUT WE CAN'T,
'CAUSE WE ALREADY ARE.
OKAY, I'M NOT SAYING
I BELIEVE YOU,
BUT COME HERE
AND KISS ME.
BOO.
SCARED YOU, HUH?
LOOK, MINE IS NOT
THE QUESTION;
MINE IS ONLY
A WARNING FOR YOU TWO.
JOEL IS VERY
CLOSE BEHIND.
LOOK, IN THAT DREAM,
SHE WAS REALLY REAL.
SHE SAID I COULDN'T FALL ASLEEP
OR WE'D LOSE THEM FOREVER...
LIKE OZ
OR SOMETHING.
- WHAT ELSE DID SHE SAY?
- SHE SAID THAT SHE REALLY LOVES YOU.
LAINIE, THAT WAS
A SECRET. GOD.
EXCUSE ME.
SHELLEY.
- WOMEN ARE NUTS.
- YOU'RE TELLING ME.
HEY, ASSHOLE.
- HEY, HEY.
- JOEL, JOEL.
THE POOR GUY IS MY BUDDY.
NOW IT'S BETWEEN ME AND YOU.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, JOEL?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
STOP IT, JOEL.
THAT'S ENOUGH.
HEY, I'M DOING THIS
FOR YOU, ALL RIGHT?
I DON'T NEED IT,
ALL RIGHT?
I DIDN'T NEED IT
LAST NIGHT.
DINGER DIDN'T NEED IT THE OTHER
DAY ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD.
AND NONE OF US NEED IT NOW.
THAT'S ENOUGH OF THIS SHIT.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
HEY, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
- HEY, YOU.
- THAT'S FOR ME.
- YOU, OUT OF HERE. YOU, INSIDE.
- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
- YOU, COME WITH ME.
- I CAN'T. COME ON.
- LET'S GO.
- I CAN'T GO.
Dinger:
WHY ME? WHY ALWAYS ME?
WOW, I ALWAYS THOUGHT
"S.A.T." MEANT
"SATURDAY AFTERNOON TEST."
WHAT IS UP?
OH, IT'S YOU.
YEAH, IS LAINIE HOME?
NOPE.
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE SHE'S AT?
I THOUGHT MAYBE
SHE WAS WITH YOU,
SO I GUESS THINGS
COULD BE WORSE.
YOU DON'T CARE MUCH
FOR ME, DO YOU?
WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE?
I'LL BE SURE TO TELL HER
YOU CAME BY.
LATELY WHERE YOU FIND
THAT KELLER BOY,
YOU FIND MY DAUGHTER.
NOW WE LIKE YOU
A LOT, JOEL.
WE'D LIKE TO SEE YOU
IN THE FAMILY.
♪ WHERE IS SHE? WHERE IS SHE? ♪
♪ I KEEP WAITING ♪
♪ FOR A CALL ♪
♪ WHERE IS SHE? WHERE IS SHE? ♪
FOR SOME REASON,
I'M JEALOUS OF HER.
I'M NOT SURE I BELIEVE
I AM WHO YOU SAY I AM
OR IF I JUST WANT YOU
TO WANT ME MORE.
I THINK WHAT SHE WAS
TRYING TO TELL US
IS THAT WE CAN'T
FALL ASLEEP TONIGHT
OR WE COULD
LOSE THEM FOREVER.
BOBBY, I'M AS ANXIOUS TO
MATURE AS THE NEXT GIRL,
BUT I'M NOT LOOKING TO
RUSH IT QUITE THAT MUCH.
I DON'T THINK
YOU GET IT.
THERE'S REALLY
NO RISK.
BOBBY AND LAINIE
WILL ALWAYS EXIST.
WILL I STILL
LIKE YOU...
I MEAN, AFTER,
YOU KNOW...?
I HOPE SO.
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE YOU, BOBBY.
I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE ME EITHER.
COME ON, YOU ALWAYS SAID
YOU LIKED ADVENTURE.
YEAH, I KNOW,
BUT I'M NOT SO SURE
ABOUT THIS.
PLEASE.
I NEED YOU TO DO THIS
WITH ME.
OKAY.
I'LL DO THIS WITH YOU
IF YOU PROMISE ME
THAT AFTER THIS YOU'LL
NEVER BRING IT UP AGAIN.
OKAY, I PROMISE.
SWEETHEART,
- JOEL WAS HERE LOOKING FOR YOU.
- GREAT.
BOBBY, PLEASE, LET'S NOT
CAUSE A SCENE TONIGHT, OKAY?
I'LL GO WITH JOEL
AND YOU GO WITH SHELLEY.
WE CAN DEAL WITH
ALL THAT LATER.
BUT I NEED TO BE
ALONE WITH YOU TONIGHT.
I TOLD HIM I DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE YOU WERE.
I GOTTA GO.
LOOK, WE'LL BE ALONE
AFTER THE DANCE, OKAY?
OKAY.
BOBBY.
YO.
TELL HIM HOW NICE
HE LOOKS.
NO, YOU TELL HIM
HOW NICE HE LOOKS.
NO, TELL HIM
WHAT YOU TOLD ME.
OH.
UM, SON,
BOBBY,
I JUST WANT
TO TELL YOU
THAT WHAT YOU SAID
LAST NIGHT
MADE US DO
A LOT OF THINKING.
YOU WERE RIGHT.
WE DON'T LISTEN
TO YOUR PROBLEMS.
THANK YOU.
TELL HIM WE'LL TRY
TO DO A BETTER JOB.
UM, YOU HEARD
WHAT YOUR FATHER SAID.
YEAH, I HEARD HIM.
LISTEN, MOM,
COULD YOU TELL DAD
THAT I LOVE HIM
AND I LOVE YOU TOO
AND I'M GONNA
MISS YOU BOTH
IN A WEIRD SORT OF WAY?
I MEAN THAT.
I GOT A DANCE TO GO TO.
I GOTTA GO.
WHEN HE COMES BACK,
WILL YOU ASK HIM
WHAT HE MEANT BY THAT?
THIS IS TERRIFIC.
I KNOW YOU LIKE IT
CRUNCHY.
HEY, WHAT,
ARE YOU NUTS, MAN?
- SHUT UP.
- JOEL.
HEY, BOBBY.
HEY, KELLER, MAN,
WHERE'S LAINIE?
LOOKING FOR YOU.
I THINK YOU SHOULD TALK TO ME.
COME HERE, PLEASE.
WHAT WAS THAT
ALL ABOUT?
I DON'T KNOW, BUT HE'S
GETTING REALLY TRASHED.
THEY'LL WORK IT OUT.
LOOK, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.
EVER SINCE THE ACCIDENT...
HEY, THERE ARE NO ACCIDENTS.
IS THAT WHY YOU'VE BEEN SO FRIGID, HUH?
NOW YOU OWE ME.
- STOP IT, JOEL.
- HEY, FUCK YOU.
- WHY CAN'T I EVEN SAY IT, HUH?
- YOU KNOW, JOEL, JUST HIT ME.
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BOBBY.
IT WAS YOU,
WHAT YOU WANTED.
YOU DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT ME.
WELL, I DO.
AND I WANT OUT.
NO GODDAMN WAY.
YOU'RE MINE.
GET OFF.
- HEY!
- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING, MAN?
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- GET HER OUT OF HERE, GO.
COME ON, COME ON,
LET'S GO.
- WATCH OUT!
- Dinger: GO.
- RELAX, MAN.
- I'M ALL RIGHT. I'M ALL RIGHT.
SHIT.
JOEL, JOEL.
HEY, PRETTY BOY,
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
FAGGOT.
COME ON, LAINIE.
OH, GEE, I'M SORRY
ABOUT THAT, JOEL.
YOU KNOW, I SHOULDN'T HAVE
TOLD YOU I SAW THEM TOGETHER.
I GUESS I'M NOT
A VERY GOOD FRIEND.
HEY, FAGGOT, YOU'RE DEAD.
YOU'RE GODDAMN DEAD.
ME AND MY FRIENDS ARE HAVING A
LITTLE PARTY TONIGHT AT THE BRIDGE.
AND I THINK YOU AND YOU AND ALL YOUR
LITTLE FAGGOT FRIENDS OUGHT TO BE THERE.
- YOU'RE NOT SO TOUGH NOW, ARE YOU, JOEL?
- FAGGOT.
LISTEN TO ME.
LISTEN TO ME, ALL RIGHT?
THEY'RE SHIT.
THEY'RE NOTHING... NOTHING, ALL RIGHT?
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,

ME... DINGER,
THIS UNBELIEVABLY LOOKING GUY,
SITTING OUT HERE,
FREEZING MY ASS OFF
IN SOME BUTT-UGLY
RED MUSTANG.
WELL, WHAT TIME
IS IT?
I DON'T HAVE A WATCH.
I NEVER HAD A WATCH.
WHY DID I LOOK
AT MY WRIST?
HAD A DANCE,
DANCING PERFECTLY
WITH A HOT CHICK.
SHE WANTED ME.
I KNOW SHE WANTED ME.
WELL, EVERY GIRL
WANTS ME.
I SHOULD BE IN HAWAII

"HELLO, HONEY."
OH, HERE COMES ASSHOLE.
WHAT DID YOU GET
IN THERE, MAN?
GOT A LITTLE MORE
OF THIS
AND THIS.
WHAT ARE YOU...
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH THAT, JOEL?
I'M GONNA DRINK IT.
I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA
DRINK THAT.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH
THE GUN, JOEL... THE GUN?
HEY, I'M GONNA JOIN THE
PARTY AT THE BRIDGE, MAN,
AND THE FIRST GUY
THAT PISSES ME OFF
GETS A LITTLE
SURPRISE.
JOEL, COME ON, MAN. DON'T YOU THINK
THAT YOU'RE TAKING THIS THING
- A LITTLE TOO FAR?
- GET OUT OF THE CAR.
HEY, LOOK, I'M NOT TRYING
TO START SHIT WITH YOU.
I'M YOUR FRIEND, JOEL.
I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU GO TO JAIL...
YOU KNOW, JAIL,
BEHIND BARS.
HEY, HE HUMILIATED ME,
MAN, ALL RIGHT?
RIGHT?
I'M NOT GONNA LET THIS SHIT SLIDE.
LOOK, MAN, I'M NOT GONNA
BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.
LOOK, IF I HAVE TO,
I'LL STOP YOU.
HEY, NOBODY'S GONNA STOP
ME AGAIN, ALL RIGHT?
NOW GET OUT!
OUT!

- GET OUT. GET THE HELL OUT.
- DON'T, MAN.
- OUT. OUT.
JOEL, MAN, WHAT ARE YOU...?
HEY, MAN.
JOEL, COME ON, MAN.
WOW, WHAT A GODDAMN
PSYCHO.
- SHELLEY.
- HI. WHERE'S LAINIE?
SHE'S AT THE DANCE
WITH JOEL.
NAH. NO, SHE LEFT.
JOEL HIT HER AND SHE LEFT.
- WHAT? WHY?
- JOEL HIT HER?
- YEAH.
- WHAT HAPPENED?
I DON'T KNOW.
ALL I KNOW IS SHE'S WITH BOBBY
AND IT'S PRETTY MUCH
ALL HIS FAULT.
I FEEL SILLY.
COME ON.

HEY! YO!
WAIT A SECOND, BOYS.
MAN, IT'S A PARTY.
WHO'S GOT THE CHIPS?
LAINIE, IF THAT BOY COMES, I
DON'T WANT YOU TALKING TO HIM.
YOU DON'T SAY.
DAMN IT, I'M TIRED
OF THIS ATTITUDE.
I'M SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING
MOVING US TO ANOTHER TOWN.
THESE KIDS, AND
ESPECIALLY THAT BOY,
ARE NOTHING
BUT A BAD INFLUENCE.
I MEAN, LOOK AT THAT FIGHT
YOU HAD AT THE DANCE.
NOW WHY DID YOU HAVE TO
PROVOKE JOEL LIKE THAT?
YEAH, I PROVOKED JOEL.
I WOULDN'T LET HIM SCREW ME
STANDING UP ON THE DANCE FLOOR.
I SHOULD BE
COMMITTED FOR THAT.
MOTHER, PLEASE.
I'D LOVE TO SEE YOU MOVE AWAY.
DAMN IT, LAINIE,

OH, AND ANOTHER

I DON'T WANT YOU AND MY MOTHER

SO OBNOXIOUS.

IT'S JUST
SHE'S SO RELENTLESS.
YEAH, I KNOW,
BUT YOU GOTTA REMEMBER
SHE MEANS WELL.
JOEL, WE'RE HERE.
DON'T DO ANYTHING.
JOEL, I SAID
I WAS SORRY.
WHAT ELSE?
WHAT?
HEY, YOU GUYS CAN SPLIT.
I'M HAVING A LOT OF FUN DOING THIS SHIT.
COME ON, MAN,
PUT THE GUN DOWN.
JUST COME WITH US.
WE'RE YOUR FRIENDS.
DINGER, IF YOU WERE MY FRIEND,
YOU WOULD HAVE COME WITH ME.
COME ON, MAN, YOU
PUSHED ME OUT OF THE CAR.

BOBBY, LET US TALK TO HIM, MAN.
BACK OFF.
NO, YOU BACK OFF.
ALL RIGHT, WHAT ARE WE
ALL DOING HERE, GUYS?
WHAT ARE WE ALL
HERE FOR?
BECAUSE I KICKED
DUMAS'S ASS?
SO WHAT?
BIG DEAL.
HE KICKED MINE BACK.
EVEN IS EVEN.
FAIR IS FAIR.
YOU GUYS DON'T SEEM
TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING.
I HAVE BEEN
LIVING MY LIFE
DAY BY DAY
FOR SO LONG
THAT I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER
WHY I HATE DUMAS
OR LIKE DINGER.
20 YEARS FROM NOW,
I'M GONNA BE SITTING BACK
AND I'M GONNA BE THINKING
OF MY SCHOOL FRIENDS
AND I'M GONNA THINK
OF DUMAS.
DUMAS WAS AN ASSHOLE,
BUT SO WHAT?
WE WERE STILL FRIENDS
IN SCHOOL.
AREN'T I RIGHT?
AREN'T WE FRIENDS?
LET ME GET THIS
STRAIGHT, MAN:
YOU GO AND STEAL
MY GIRLFRIEND
AND TELL ME WHO MY
FRIENDS ARE, HUH?
ALL RIGHT,
I DIDN'T STEAL
YOUR GIRL, OKAY?
I KNOW THAT IT HURTS.
I KNOW THAT.
BUT THAT'S OKAY.
IT'S SUPPOSED TO HURT.
LIFE IS TOO SHORT, GUYS.
YOU TURN AROUND,
ONE SECOND...
BAM! IT'S OVER.
I MEAN, YOU SPEND
TOO MUCH TIME
THINKING ABOUT THE THINGS
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE
AND MISSING THE THINGS
THAT YOU DO.
WHY DO WE HAVE TO TAKE SOMETHING SO FAR
THAT IT CAN'T BE TAKEN BACK?
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.
BECAUSE WE'RE YOUNG.
AND WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG,
EVERY LITTLE THING
SEEMS SO BIG.
JOEL, YOU'VE GOT A GUN.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
YOU'VE GOT A GUN, JOEL.
YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT DUMAS.
AND YOU'RE LUCKY IT'S NOT
POINTED AT YOU, MAN, ALL RIGHT?
OH, REALLY?
YEAH, REALLY.
SO YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT YOU'RE
SO PISSED OFF AT ME
THAT THIS POOR BASTARD IS
GONNA DIE BECAUSE OF IT?
WELL, MAYBE THAT GUN ISPOINTED
IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.
KELLER, MAN, SHUT UP.
NO. COME ON, WHY DON'T WE ALL
JUST MAKE THIS REAL BAD?
COME ON, LET'S SEE
HOW FAR WE CAN TAKE IT.
WHY DON'T WE DO THAT
RIGHT NOW?
WHY DON'T YOU SHOOT
DUMAS IN THE EYE?
OR BETTER YET,
MAYBE THIS WILL
MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD.
WHY DON'T YOU ALL BEAT
THE SHIT OUT OF ME?
COME ON, IT'LL MAKE YOU
FEEL GOOD.
YOU GUYS
MAKE ME SICK.

[screaming]
Go to hell.
[laughter]
Burn, witch.
Here he is.
Welcome, little William.
Mr. Churchill.
Yes.
NURSE: Would you like to see your wife and son now?
Yes, of course.
Oh, god.
I'm so excited.
This is--
This is Linda Swanson.
She's a friend of my wife's.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Only the immediate family is allowed to see the mother now.
Can I lie?
I'm not at liberty-- besides, it's going to be so crowded when your wife's family gets here.
Uh, my wife doesn't have any family.
Isn't there something we can do?
It's hospital policy.
I'm sorry, Ms. Swanson.
Damn.
It's all right.
I'll wait.
If you'll follow me?
We've all fallen in love with your wife.
She's absolutely adorable.
Yes, I feel the same way.
And her accent is so cute.
She immigrated from Poland with her parents as a child.
Oh, that's interesting.
-Oh, Mr. Churchill?
-Yes.
Dr. Adler
I'd like to congratulate you.
Thank you very much.
Nurse, we need you in room 427 stat.
I'll be right there.
I'll show him to the room.
Thanks.
Congratulations again.
JOHN: Thank you.
He's so perfect.
Thank you.
I am so happy.
How are you feeling?
I'm OK.
I hate to break up the party.
He's got to go back to the nursery.
I made it.
Where is he?
Where's the baby?
Oh, you just missed him.
Oh, shit.
You'll just have to stop by the house next week.
[sigh].
Who does he look like?
His father.
His mother.
Oh, well.
Why, John?
I'll be working late every day.
I want you to have some help with the baby, and Mother is glad to do it.
Yeah.
But I won't be comfortable in your mother's home.
It'll just be for a week, Grace.
Believe me, it will be much easier on you this way, until you get your strength back.
Besides, mother will love to have you and the baby.
OK.
Good.
It's settled.
Only for a week.
Just a week.
Your wheels have arrived.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Good luck.
Thanks very much.
I'll see you.
All right, easy does it.
Thanks.
You go on inside.
I'll get the bags.
OK.
ELIZABETH: Grace.
GRACE: Elizabeth.
Grace.
I didn't expect you back so soon.
How are you, dear?
Very well, thank you.
Oh, you look radiant.
GRACE: Thanks.
Come.
Let me look at you.
Oh, Grace.
And this must be our little William.
GRACE: Isn't he precious?
ELIZABETH: He's adorable.
It's like a dream.
It's not a dream.
It's real.
He looks like both his parents.
Well, shall we take our little prince up to his nursery?
Yes.
Shall we go, little William?
I've kept the nursery simple.
I hope you didn't go to any trouble, Elizabeth.
No trouble at all, Grace.
Well, here we are.
Oh.
This is very nice.
I want you to be comfortable.
Thank you.
Oh, may I?
Oh, certainly.
Oh, so beautiful.
So, so, so, so--
JOHN: Grace?
Do you want to put the blanket on him?
Oh, yes.
Thank you.
Your first grandchild, Mother.
Yes, finally.
I think he recognizes me.
Oh.
Now let me show you to your room, Grace.
OK.
Oh, it's all right.
I've got him.
John, don't you think William should sleep in our room?
You'll be right down the hall from him.
Are you sure it's OK?
He'll be fine.
Come on.
How do you feel?
Tired.
Mm-hmm.
But happy.
Good.
I love you, John.
And I love you.
Now, you get some rest.
Stay with me.
[sigh].
You've been through a lot.
You need to get your strength back for William.
[knocking]
ELIZABETH: I made some tea.
Do you think she'd like some?
JOHN: Yes, thank you, Mother.
Mother made some tea.
I was so looking forward to being alone with you.
We'll only be here a few days.
Until you can get back on your feet.
Come on, have some tea.
-Ugh.
-Now, don't be a baby.
I never liked it much, either.
But it's good for you.
It looks like we have a storm coming.
[thunder]
All right, a big one now.
That's a good girl.
All right.
Cover up.
There we go.
Goodnight.
Goodnight, John.
[door opening]
[gasp].
[sigh]
You OK?
Good morning.
Oh.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Hi, baby.
I had a rough night.
Oh, you did?
I'm sorry.
You're probably just getting used to the house.
Yeah.
That must be it.
I've got to go to work.
Mother went to the market.
She'll be back in less than an hour.
So help yourself to breakfast, or anything else you need, all right?
Can't you stay with me?
Just today?
There's nothing I'd rather do, but I can't.
I got to go.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Sh.
Go to sleep.
Sh.
[gasp]
Who are you?
Well, hello.
Grace.
I don't believe you've met Ellsworth, our butler.
How do you do?
He's mute.
Oh.
Grace, we don't use this part of the house.
It really isn't safe.
I think we should go.
[phone ringing]
Hello.
Father James?
This is Grace.
I had a boy.
Congratulations, my dear child.
I knew everything would be fine.
Just fine.
Uh, how do you feel?
A little tired, but John has been very good to me.
I feel very happy father.
Well, you deserve to be happy.
I'm absolutely delighted for you.
Father?
FATHER JAMES (ON
PHONE): Yes, my child.
GRACE (ON PHONE): I want you to come and bless my baby.
Well, yes, of course.
Well, I'd only be too honored.
Thank you, Father.
You are so sweet.
I can't believe you are mine.
What a beautiful sight.
This has made up for everything
I never had as a child.
I'm glad.
Thank you, John.
Now Grace, don't.
We did this together.
Yes, we did, didn't we?
Are you all right?
Yes.
Just a little dizzy.
JOHN: Grace.
Grace, are you sure?
I don't know.
JOHN: Here's mother.
She'll help you with the baby.
Yes.
That's right.
Come to me, little William.
See you soon.
All right, let's take it slow.
Come on.
You're going to be all right.
Be careful now.
Take it slow.
Here's a step.
Be careful.
Come on, baby.
That's it.
We go [inaudible].
Come on, Grace.
I've got you, love.
That's it.
Careful.
Some more steps.
Some more steps.
Healthy baby.
Thanks.
Sweet child.
Yes.
Yes.
[knocking]
I'll get it.
Linda.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I got lost.
Oh.
Thank god you're here.
Where's the party?
-Come on in.
-This is for William.
Thank you.
Hi, everybody.
I'm Linda.
Hi, John.
Oh, there he is.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
You are so precious, yes you are.
Oh my goodness.
There we go.
There we go.
Oh, he's precious.
Oh, look, William.
Linda brought you a toy.
Oh, Linda.
He loves it.
Grace, you crack me up.
He doesn't even know it exists.
GRACE: Well, I love it.
[baby crying]
LINDA: There we go.
Do you want to see the house?
Yes.
Come on, let's go.
Bye.
Bye.
Did you see the way that old guy was eying my thighs?
Yes.
Oh.
This place is huge.
I know.
Whoever would have thought two years ago you'd be giving me a tour of the family mansion?
Back then I just went from fix to fix.
And now you're married to John Churchill.
A guy like that.
I mean, he owns half of Massachusetts.
You helped me a lot back then.
We helped each other.
This is beautiful.
How old is this place?
John says it's about 300 years old.
Phew.
You lucked out.
Linda, why do you think John chose me?
I don't know.
Maybe it's because you're beautiful, intelligent, and you have a great foreign accent.
Men love foreign accents.
GRACE: They do not.
They do, too.
I wish I had one.
Wow, 300 years old.
I bet this place has secret passageways.
Does it?
It does, doesn't it?
Sh.
LINDA: Where?
Come.
I'll show you.
Boo.
Stop it.
Sh.
Sh.
Ah.
Holy moly.
You scared the shit out of me.
Oh, Ellsworth.
Oh, I was just showing the house to Linda.
Oh.
Oh, I forgot.
Uh, this part of the house is, uh, closed.
Uh, thank you, Ellsworth.
(WHISPERING) Thank you, Ellsworth.
We better get down.
He's a real charmer.
[doorbell ringing]
You must be Father James.
We've been expecting you.
I'm Elizabeth Churchill.
Pleased to meet you.
Oh, Father James.
Oh, Grace.
How lovely you look.
Thank you.
Linda, how are you?
I'm pretty good.
Not as good as Grace here, but I'm doing all right.
Oh, I'm happy to hear that.
Come on in, Father.
I want to show you my baby.
Yes.
Yes.
Hello, Father.
GRACE: Father.
Father.
Father, are you all right?
Huh?
Father, are you all right?
I, I don't feel very well.
Please, excuse me.
[screaming]
Is everything OK, Father?
Yes.
Yes, I'll-- I'll be there in a moment.
Do you think he's all right?
Well, he says so.
But if he has a flu, he shouldn't go near the baby.
Are you all right, Father?
I don't feel well.
I must go now, my child.
I apologize, Mrs. Churchill.
Certainly.
Good day, everyone.
Take care, Father.
Bye, Father.
Come, I'll walk you to the door.
You must come to see me at the church tomorrow.
You must bring the child.
I want to baptize him immediately.
Is something wrong?
I'll see you tomorrow.
We'll talk tomorrow.
Thank you, Father.
God be with you, Grace.
I found this in the garden.
I thought you might like it.
I'll-- I'll leave it here for you.
[gasp]
[phone ringing]
The Lord send him to Satan.
The Lord rebuke thee, oh, Satan.
[inaudible] the Lord hath chosen [inaudible].
Grace.
Grace.
Grace.
Grace.
Grace.
You are such a good, little boy.
Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.
There's Mommy.
There's Mommy.
Hi, Mommy.
Hi, Mommy.
Hi.
These things are so much fun.
You feeling OK?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Come on, let's go lay down, you big boy.
You big, old thing.
Here we go.
OK.
Here we go.
Oh, there you go.
There you go.
You are so adorable.
Yes, you are.
Oh my goodness.
What do they put these things on with?
Grace.
Thank you.
I want a baby.
How about finding a husband first?
Nowadays, husbands are a detail.
A minor detail.
GRACE: A child needs a father.
Well, that depends.
[sigh].
This yard is a mess.
I didn't even know you had a green thumb.
I used to help my father when I was a little girl.
LINDA: Grace, you all right?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Just bad memories.
They were so happy.
I still don't know why my father did it.
You don't think insanity runs in the family, do you?
I don't know, it runs in mine.
Bad joke.
Come on, Grace.
You are not crazy.
He was fine.
Until one day he just snapped.
Now, what makes you think that that is going to happen to you, huh?
Grace.
Don't you think it's time little William came inside now?
He's fine.
It's a little chilly out here, isn't it?
He's fine.
All right, dear.
Whatever you say.
Thank you, Ellsworth.
Grace, are you all right?
Yes.
Good.
But you haven't touched your dinner, dear.
[gasp].
I'm sorry I startled you.
You seem a little jumpy.
What's the matter?
I'm frightened.
What are you frightened of?
I don't know.
Everything's going to be fine.
You just had a long day, that's all.
You need to get your sleep.
Come on.
That's it.
Here, I brought you some tea.
John.
Stay with me.
I have to get some more work done.
I'll be in later.
Drink your tea.
Goodnight.
[thump]
John?
John?
Elizabeth?
[sigh]
[thumping]
[screaming]
Grace.
Grace, why don't you come inside?
The police have left.
Grace, please.
Come inside.
I can't.
JOHN: Why not?
The garden needs weeding.
Grace, you're upset.
I know how much the father meant to you.
Why did he do it?
JOHN: I don't know.
How did he get up there?
I don't know.
I just can't understand.
Come inside.
Could you stand in one spot?
You're wearing me out.
I could have helped Father James.
You're being too hard on yourself.
I could have helped him.
You had no way of knowing.
What?
Wow, this is really neat.
I wonder what this is.
I wonder who they are.
Or were.
Grace?
Grace, you OK?
Yeah.
What is this room have to do with Father James' death?
So?
I saw Father James hanged in this mirror.
What do you mean?
I saw him hanged before he was dead.
How?
I don't know.
Grace, it's just a mirror.
I saw it.
I've seen other things, too.
Grace, you're worrying me.
Something is wrong here.
I'm scared.
Grace, there's nothing there.
You talk to John about this?
No.
You think it's all in my mind, don't you?
[sigh].
I think you're under a lot of stress.
I know what I saw.
Here, I want you to keep this with you.
What is it?
It's the cross
Father James gave me.
Please, Grace.
You're scaring me.
Oh, there you are, love.
Hello, Linda.
Mother needs your help with William.
He's a lot to handle.
OK.
I'll talk to you later.
Excuse us.
John.
May I talk with you for a moment?
Sure, Linda.
What's on your mind?
I'm worried about Grace.
Yes, we all are.
Father's death was a great shock to her.
I know.
Is she taking any medication?
Has the doctor prescribed any?
No.
I think it's just going to take her a little time to get over it, that's all.
I'm sure she'll be fine.
Thanks for your concern.
I should get back now.
[sigh].
Hi.
Hi.
I need you.
I'm here.
Hold me.
You seem so distant lately.
No, I'm here.
Make love to me.
It's too soon.
I don't care.
Honey, this really isn't the place.
Grace, stop it.
What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong.
This just isn't the place.
Ever since we got here, you've been avoiding me.
That's not true.
It is true.
You spend more time with your mother than you do with me.
You're imagining things.
I am not imagining things.
Lower your voice.
I will not lower my voice.
Why are you so upset?
Just forget it.
Grace.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Do you want to talk about it?
No.
Grace, I know what you've been going through.
But this has got to stop.
I love you.
It's pretty hard to tell sometimes.
[sigh].
I know I should be spending more time with you.
I apologize.
I'm sorry for the way
I've been behaving.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
It's all right.
Let's go home.
Did you hear me?
I want to go home.
When you're up to it.
I'm fine.
I just need to go home.
What's wrong?
We can't.
Why not?
We lost the house.
What?
There was a fire.
We lost everything.
When?
A week ago.
A week ago?
JOHN: I didn't know how to tell you.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know how to tell you.
After all you've been through,
I knew it would upset you.
Please don't touch me.
ELIZABETH: Grace.
Grace.
Where are you going?
I'm going to see my house.
I don't think that's a very good idea, dear.
You'll just upset yourself.
I want to see it.
Well, why are you taking William with you ?
I want him with me.
Oh, that's a very long drive for such a small baby.
I think you better leave him here.
OK.
Don't worry.
I'll take care of him.
WOMAN: Hi.
Hello.
Terrible fire last night.
What?
Terrible fire last night.
That can't be.
It burned down last week.
Maybe I'm crazy, but I saw that fire last night from the window across the street.
John.
John.
John?
John?
John?
[laughter]
No.
Go to hell.
No.
ELIZABETH: Grace.
Grace, where are you?
Grace.
JOHN: Grace.
Grace.
ELIZABETH: Grace.
Stay away from me.
ELIZABETH: Grace, I've made you some tea.
I don't want any tea.
Where's William?
He's in the nursery.
Where's William?
He's in the nursery.
I don't believe you.
I want to see him.
It's OK, sweetie.
He's sleeping in the nursery.
I've seen him.
Linda.
Grace, please have your tea.
I don't want any tea.
Stay away from me.
We'll wait outside.
You want to tell me what happened, sweetie?
I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?
I don't remember.
You don't remember anything?
I didn't do it, Linda.
I'm scared.
John and Elizabeth--
It's OK.
Hey, I'm going to stay right here with you tonight, OK?
So you won't have anything to worry about.
You just get some rest.
Thanks, Linda.
You bet.
LINDA: Grace.
Grace.
Grace.
Linda?
Linda?
LINDA: Grace.
Linda.
Linda?
Linda?
[screaming]
Grace.
Grace.
Grace.
It's OK.
It's OK.
Sh.
Sh.
It's all right.
Easy.
Easy.
It was just a bad dream.
Oh, Linda.
It's OK.
I'm right here.
Oh.
It's OK.
It was horrible.
In that room.
I want to get out of here.
-It's all right.
Everything's OK.
It was just a bad dream.
All right?
Oh, Linda.
Where did you get this?
This looks like the cross you gave me.
It is the cross I gave you.
Father James' cross.
Where did you get this?
I left this at home on my nightstand.
Grace?
Can you show me where you found this?
Linda?
Linda?
Linda?
Grace.
Grace.
Grace?
"John and Elizabeth Stocton were accused of practicing witchcraft in 1687.
They were burned together at the stake.
The townspeople conducted the burning in the backyard of the Stocton family home.
It is believed that
Elizabeth Stocton was pregnant at the time of the burning."
You scared me.
[screaming]
[screaming].
Hello, Grace.
We've been expecting you.
It's all over.
John.
We have to thank you, Grace.
Isn't that right, Elizabeth?
Yes.
You have brought back our child.
You're sick.
He's my child.
He's our child.
We are John and
Elizabeth Stocton.
And we have returned.
You, Grace, you were just a vessel for the return of our child.
Satan is most powerful when he inhabits such an angel of light.
[laughter]
No, John.
Oh, John, no.
No, John.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No!
[screaming].
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
[baby crying]
William.
[music playing]
TIME OF THE GYPSIES
A love movie.
You're ruining my youth...
I've been married for 12 hours!
And this bastard is dead drunk!
They want to ruin my life and decerebrate me with their syringes.
But I ran away.
I'm not crazy.
Ordering me to drink potions and swallow vials!
Vials!
Binding my soul like a performing bear!
Tying my wings!
A Wingless spirit!
My soul is free!
Free like a bird!
My soul is flying or going back down.
My soul is crying or laughing and singing.
When God came down to earth, he could not deal with the gypsies... and took the next flight back.
It's not my fault!
Roll for daddy!
Do better!
God!
Help me for once!
Do you really exist?
I lost everything!
And not even in front of a man.
Look at this pig
I've been fattening up!
One hundred...
He's winning and he's laughing!
All right, God!
Let this dirty pig win!
But let's make a deal, me and you.
Just let me win once and I'll believe in you.
I swear it!
Yes. I'll believe in you.
I'll gamble my life to win against this pig!
That's the least you can do for the gypsies!
Do it for me instead of helping this dirty pig!
Help me at least once!
Go sleep it off!
You ruined my wedding!
Bastard! Drunkard!
We made a deal, God!
Your house will be white as snow with this lime.
After the house I'll go to the doctor for my leg.
Here's the money. Take it...
I'm coming, darling.
God bless you for saving my husband.
I'm back from the market.
But I didn't sell anything.
So I'm offering you this turkey.
A modest present to bring you good fortune.
My medical care is free.
One more... One more...
God bless you and your children.
Eat... Eat...
Perhan!
Don't cry, Danira.
Perhan!
Look what I'm bringing you!
For me?
For you alone! Yes!
You're obedient.
Grandmother loves you.
I'd give you anything.
For me alone?
Yes! You're taking care of
Danira... your little sister.
You're working hard! Hard!
I'd give you my soul...
Mama! Whose bird is it?
I just gave it to Perhan.
Perhan? What about me?
Always your grandson?
He's obedient.
Obedient!
I'm your son, not him!
There's never anything for me!
Am I a war criminal?
I'll go back to Germany!
Don't be stupid.
Stupid? Who's stupid?
Who's stupid?
I've had enough!
This for Perhan, that for Perhan..
I'm out of here!
I'm going back to Germany.
It's my home! Understand?
You and your dear Perhan can rot here in Yugoslavia!
Leave me alone!
You dishonored me, you bad girl!
Dishonored!
Stop hitting me!
Move, you bad girl!
Where is your Casanova of a son?
Come down!
Come down so we can talk!
Come and look what he did to my daughter!
I'm going to pull out his eyes!
I'm gonna cut his throat!
Let go of me, old woman!
Where is he?
Find him now!
I want to see him!
Calm down!
No! Bring me this bastard so I can skin him!
I'm gonna kill him!
I'll gut him!
He dishonored my daughter!
He filled her belly!
She's not even thirteen years old!
- There's nothing I can do about it!
- I'll kill you! Then I'll kill him!
- I'm going to kill you!
- Kill me?
- You're just a slut!
- Watch your tongue!
- It's my house!
- Go get your son!
That's enough!
Did you like it? Did you like it?
When he was lying on you?
And you want to get money out of us?
Don't you?
You're kidding!
Your son is fucking anything that moves!
My brothers will castrate him!
Sit down.
Okay, I'll sit down.
I want to talk to your son face to face.
There's nothing you can do if he wants her!
She's likes a flashing light as soon as she sees him!
She's flirting around!
She's flirting around?
She's a real slut!
Shame on you, you old whore!
Winged son of the sun...
Winged son of the sun...
Oh... My child!
Another one to heal?
I'm not here for that.
Mom turned the house upside down.
She wants it covered with lime for Saint Georges day.
Winged son of the sun...
Perhan! Prepare some lime for Azra!
The special kind!
Go...
I've come to buy some lime.
Some lime?
Fine.
Go away!
Sit down.
Who will carry such a big bag?
Me, I suppose.
Unless you'll help me.
Do you know how lime is made?
Listen to this.
Temperature is the most important thing.
If you don't keep the oven temperature constant... the limestone doesn't fire correctly.
Fire is the basis of it.
Wood is burning and smoke goes through the neck of the chimney.
The iron plate is made white-hot.
The limestone burns and evaporates in the air...
Only the white powder is left.
Only God knows how much heat is needed for that.
Do you know how to kiss?
There would be no white houses without lime.
Plum jam would be sour.
Do you know how to kiss?
Grandma says that lime comes from the breast of Mother Stone.
Mother Forest and Mother Stone had an argument.
And Mother Forest bit
Mother Stone breast.
That's why lime is white as milk.
Earth gave it birth.
Water baptised it.
And Fire fed it.
Do you know how to kiss?
Like in the movies.
Stop!
How long can you kiss without breathing?
About... fifteen, twenty minutes.
Go!
God damn!
Your lips are like a magnet.
Do you want to see something?
Look.
Look at the can.
A mirage!
Don't move!
Don't move!
Who wants to marry her?
Me.
You? Marry her?
Do you hear that?
This little idiot came to spoil our vacation!
This scarecrow wants to marry your daughter!
Get inside!
Azra, stay here!
Oh yes? Obey me!
Now!
I told you to stay!
And I told you to get inside!
Are you deaf?
You're killing me inches!
You're crushing me!
I'm going to pass out!
I bled myself white for you!
And now that's what I get!
And you!
You short-sighted bastard!
Raceless! And pennyless!
What are you waiting for?
Get lost now, scumbag!
And you? And you?
Are you suddenly deaf-and-dumb?
Cat got your tongue?
Mute as a grave, aren't you?
Speak!
You're hopeless!
God!
Where are you?
Help!
Somebody help me!
I'm being slaughtered!
I'm being murdered!
Somebody, help!
Gimme a minute so
I can pull out your eyes!
Murderer of his wife!
Assassin!
Help! Call the police!
The judge! The firemen!
Bastard!
God, why me?
I'll scald you alive!
Dear grandmother...
I tried to get married three times.
And I failed.
This world isn't for me.
I'll swallow this letter to escape the shame of committing suicide for a woman.
I can't live without Azra.
She's a goddess and her mother is a harpy.
God help me!
Yours, Perhan.
I'll start a new life if I can't jump over my shadow.
One... Two... Three...
Now!
Fuck my shadow!
The moon is smiling but we're crying!
Azra!
Go away!
Cries are coming.
Laughter is dying!
In the stars... our cries are flying!
Around the fire, my shadow is dancing!
What is this cute bird doing at this hour?
Azra!
Azra! I love you!
I'm coming!
It's politicians we should be hanging!
Come down immediately!
Come on! You fool!
It's wrong to hang yourself in front of a church!
Open!
Open! Hatidza!
It's me, Zabit!
Come in, my friend, may God bless you.
- Happy Saint Georges day.
- You too, if it's God's will.
Sit down.
I've brought you this Scoundrel.
I won't tell you where I found him.
What are you doing?
I'm crying!
The girl is crying too?
Yes.
She's unhappy too!
Play some music for grandma.
I'll bring your accordion.
If you were my son and hanged yourself...
I would kill you...
Here! Here's your accordion.
Play your grandma's favorite tune.
Outside...
It's absolutely romantic!
We could dance in the fields if we were young!
I can still dance with such an handsome stallion!
Not bad, isn't it?
Absolutely romantic!
You're gonna burn me!
Grandma!
Are you sleeping?
Yes! You too, sleep!
Grandma!
Come.
Was my mother very beautiful?
Yes, like a nymph in the forest.
Her belly got as big as a barrel when she was expecting Danira.
I went to see the old seer who said that someone had cast a spell on her.
Her incantations weren't of any help.
So, I decided to take her to the mosque.
Germany is my country!
Merzan! Why didn't you go back to Germany?
She was very sick.
The priest read the Koran for her salvation.
In vain.
We went to a doctor.
Serious illness, pills, injections.
Nothing worked.
She dies in my arms.
So young, so beautiful...
God gives, God takes.
That's how it is.
Why am I a bastard?
Your father was a Slovene soldier.
He was doing his military service here.
I'm the bastard of a soldier.
Ruza was right.
May those who say that eat shit!
You're grandma's love.
Sleep now. Sleep. Sleep...
Go back!
I don't want you today.
Watch over Danira.
Are you deaf?
Come and see who's back from Italy.
It's Ahmed the Great,
Sheik of the Gypsies.
Come and see who's back from Italy.
But it's Ahmed the nabob!
Nice car!
How do you do, Ahmed?
So elegant!
Your white suit is magnificent!
Wanna play cards?
At noon, usual place.
I'll be there!
Ahmed, give me a few dinars for having escaped from the asylum.
I come in good faith to ask for your daughter's hand.
Get out of my sight!
Get out of here!
Faster! Come on!
It's also my grandmother's wish.
You want to marry Azra?
Do you have a job?
Is there anything you can do?
You're making objects dance!
Learn a craft...
Make money dance!
Calm down! Calm down!
My daughter is a beauty, you're not worthy of her!
I told you a hundred times, the answer is no!
- Go away!
- Calm down! Calm down!
Go back home!
Grandma! Come, help us!
I refused her hands to many others!
Don't devour my grandson!
Ah! Grandma...
It looks like you want him dead!
What do you want to drink?
Nothing.
I come to marry the kid.
And I'm bringing money.
Money.
As much as needed.
Here... Here...
Your grandson is worthless.
All he knows is to make cans slide.
No banknotes!
Teach him.
You who knows everything!
Your money is useless.
My daughter is worth millions.
She's too good for all of them!
Azra! Come here!
Have a look at this immaculate beauty!
So proud of her divine daughter!
So proud!
Yes! Have a look at her!
I'm looking! So what?
She's magnificent!
Take this good-for-nothing with you!
Get out of here, both of you!
I'll be back and you'll kiss my feet!
You, marry my daughter?
What a joke!
I have powers!
I can cast spells!
I can do some evil!
You'll lick my feet!
Get out of here, both of you!
Keep your head high!
There's still time to jump in the river!
Or to get married!
You're grandma's love.
Did you sell your lime?
Business is bad.
When will you pay your debt?
Tomorrow.
We're leaving tomorrow.
Where?
Where?
Where the police isn't.
Try to pay your debt.
Two cards.
Uncle!
Uncle! Uncle!
Come in quick!
Robert will suffocate!
Mama, save me!
Those bandits, they're gonna hunt me down.
Dry yourself off and go to bed.
No! They're dangerous!
I owe them money.
Leave me.
I want to dream.
They're criminals!
I need money.
I'll help myself.
Come on! You old witch!
Give me this fucking money!
Give it to me!
Give it or I swear that
I'll kill you all!
Give it to me!
Do you hear me, witch?
I want this money!
This is your last chance!
I don't have any money.
What's mine is yours!
You, you got some in your pants!
For your wedding!
Let go of me! Let go of me!
I want this money!
Spit it, right now!
Or I'll slaughter you!
You destroyed us with your gambling debts!
Really? Well, you'll see what else I can destroy!
Go to hell or give me this money now!
I don't have any, you fool!
How could I get some?
It's raining.
You're gonna demolish the house.
The little one is terrified.
Go away!
You'll see what I can do!
I'm born without a father!
My mother was taking care of me!
Dear old mother, never I'll forget her!
Don't cry little mother!
You'll see that I grew up.
I'll always take care of you.
As you used to take care of me.
I'm born without a father!
My mother was taking care of me!
The money!
And I'm taking the house down!
Do what you want but get me the money!
Don't cry little mother!
You'll see that I grew up...
You lost your head...
You're good for the asylum.
A very long time ago...
Heaven and Earth were husband and wife.
They had five children.
Sun...
Moon...
Fire...
Clouds...
And Water.
They made a cosy home for all their children.
The arrogant Sun tried to separate
Heaven and Earth.
But he couldn't.
The other children failed too.
But one day... the Wind swooped down on them, and Earth was separated from Heaven.
Hatidza!
Come to save my son!
Quick! Lead death away!
Blood is the great secret.
Blood is the power.
Wait. His soul hasn't awakened yet.
Merzan! My sun!
Who did that to you?
My brothers!
I saved your son and that's how you're thanking me?
Get out of here! Go away!
I'm sorry.
Putting my son to shame like that!
My only son!
That's how you're thanking me?
I didn't know. I swear!
May earth swallow me!
I'll skin them alive for that.
I've got money on me.
Take what you want.
Keep your money.
Your family is dirty.
Be careful!
You can stuff your gratitude!
Droppings of your race!
You're lucky to have saved my son.
I'll sort things out.
Trust your grandma.
You drew my turkey!
I'm gonna cut you open!
I don't give a fuck about the turkey!
I'll buy you a hundred!
Stop fighting!
Stop it, both of you.
Stop it, understood?
You, stay here!
- I'll offer you 300 turkeys!
- It was mine!
What are those manners?
And you, you're a monster!
What did you do?
What's gotten into you?
How nice!
Attacking your uncle!
You're just a coward!
I'll break your spine if I catch you...
Then I'll cut your throat.
And as a dessert,
I'll pull your teeth out one by one!
I'll crush you like a rotten pumpkin!
How dare you raise your hand on me!
You should be kissing my feet, you bastard!
Where are you going?
Go back to your sit.
Let's talk.
Do you want to pay for Robert?
The doctors failed.
Go on.
Do you see this young girl?
Do you see her leg?
They're stretching bones at Ljubljana hospital...
Help her and we're even.
I'm going to Italy.
I'll make a detour through Ljubljana.
She won't go alone.
I'm coming too.
A head of the family!
Very good!
I'll take you both.
Don't cry, Dada.
I don't want to... go to the hospital.
I'm afraid to... die!
Don't be afraid.
Merzan! What did you do, you idiot?
Shame on you!
Leave him. He's crazy, possessed by the devil.
My poor house!
Are you worried?
They're brave. You won't have any problem.
Is it hereditary?
Her leg?
Your powers!
Did they inherit them?
Only Perhan. A little.
A little?
Nothing very useful.
Perhan!
Come to see the Sheik!
Show him what you can do!
Come!
Show him...
He's gonna look after your sister.
I can't.
Show him!
- Come on!
- I can't!
He's gonna take your sister to the hospital!
Elvis! Jashar! Rambo!
Go get your instruments!
Take care of them as if they were yours.
They're my life.
Don't worry.
We have a good driver.
She'll get Marilyn Monroe's legs.
May your grand-daughter come back rich and healthy!
Come with us!
There's enough room for you.
How could I?
I'm old and sick.
Don't cry.
They'll look after your leg.
I'd be like to be sure of it.
I forgot the provisions!
Don't cry, Danira!
I know. It's unexpected.
Think about me when we'll be parted.
You must wait for me.
You must remain faithful to me.
I'll write soon.
I'll make you a movie star.
My sister will live with us.
Grandma too.
All right.
If you see my uncle Merzan, will you stay out of his way?
All right.
Good.
Don't cry.
Keep your eyes clear to watch over my betrothed.
Take better care of her than you would of me.
I have to cry when my heart is suffering.
Take good care of your little sister.
Yes, yes.
Irfan!
The King Wind rushed at his Mother.
And...
Earth separated from Heaven.
Don't cry, Dada.
Be a big girl.
Promise me that you won't leave me with them.
Yes, but don't cry.
But I'm scared.
Be brave.
Mommy!
It's our mother!
Do you see her?
- Is she beautiful?
- Very!
How does she look like?
She has hair... eyes... a nose...
A mouth... Everything!
Here we are!
Hello, doctor!
I called you.
Yes, I remember.
Don't leave me.
She's afraid.
I told her that when it will be over,
She'll have...
Marilyn Monroe's legs!
We'll see.
What's your name?
Danira Feric.
Danira Feric. Sweet!
Don't worry.
Comrade Tito has been treated here.
Let's examine her.
Doctor! I'm staying with her!
You're in good health.
Don't stay here.
Wait, Ahmed!
Leave us!
I'm sorry.
You must pay for the cares.
My brother will come tomorrow to sign for the little girl.
How can you ask to stay?
Who will feed you?
Where will you sleep?
Aren't you ashamed?
Taking the place of a sick person!
I promised grandma!
And I promised to fix her leg!
And I'll do it!
Listen.
Come to Italy with me to earn enough money to buy a house.
Sir Ahmed, please.
Osteomyelitis. We must operate.
So?
An operation, it costs an arm and a leg!
Perhan!
Don't leave me alone!
Come, this way.
Perhan!
Please, don't leave me alone!
Wait!
Where are you going?
You promised!
It's hard for you.
But once you'll be rich... you'll thank me!
Where do they come from?
Bought... on the way.
Why?
Robert needed some company.
He loves to suck in group, like puppies.
Once a man, we want the breast for us alone!
Who would sell his own children?
Those who have to, of course!
A father with eleven children has a mistress, she gives him twins, she is married too, so they decide to give them to me!
Look at them!
Stork delivery!
Zef! The western has started!
Where were you, motherfuckers?
Come on, strip off!
Learn your job!
Your turn!
You're next!
Fuck off!
Do you want him?
If he comes, say "ottanta".
If he answers "cinquanta", you accept.
Go ahead.
They want to fleece me! Read!
Tax reminder for the last 6 years,
2 fines, 3 contempts of court.
I must give them everything or they'll extradite me.
What's it got to do with me?
I must pay for your sister.
With what?
Read! You'll see!
They bled me dry!
This time,
I'm... dead beat!
And there's Robert's hospital bill in Florence.
I had almost forgotten it!
You must help me, kid.
Yes but honestly!
Do you know an honest job?
One at a time!
Hello, pretty!
Ah! It's good!
Thank you, thank you...
Zef!
Spit it!
Hey, Bosnian!
Jump!
Who told you to do that?
- No one.
- Untie him!
He refuses to work?
So what?
His sister won't be treated...
He won't have a house nor a wife.
Give him some money and send him back home.
You can go get your sister in Ljubljana.
Too bad for her!
As for you, you can live like a dog!
Gnawing at bones on the ground!
Give him some money so he can be on his way!
Perhan! Look!
Perhan! Look!
Dear grandmother,
I'm alive and healthy.
Don't worry about me.
I'm in Milan.
I'm leading a royal life whose beauty and wealth would surprise you.
It's like a dream.
A vision...
It would be the greatest joy if you were also here.
Ahmed was right, it's easy to get rich here.
Please, watch over Azra, make sure she has her feet firmly on the ground and she's not scatterbrained.
Today, I now that God has plans for all of us.
Ahmed is a father.
He speaks Italian, he knows everybody.
He has people everywhere.
Lawyers, magistrates, priests, policemen.
I make a fortune.
I'll have a house like Ahmed's.
But Italian style.
White. With a big church painted on the side.
Don't worry about Danira.
I know that Ahmed has the doctor in his pocket.
What present would you like?
I bought a small TV for Merzan.
The world will be at his feet.
The latest technology.
I want a very expensive wedding ceremony.
I want them all to remember the day of Perhan and Azra.
Your Perhan.
Where's Irfan?
Do you hear me?
Where's Irfan?
I don't know.
Where's Irfan?
He disappeared.
Imbecile!
You let him go?
Idiot!
Talk about a brother!
Out of my sight! Find him!
But where?
Anywhere!
It's your problem!
Come on, come on...
Tears?
God...
It's pointless.
What do you miss here?
Tell me!
What do you miss?
Take! White coffee, white bread... soft white cheese...
Golden compote, eagle eggs...
Anything you want!
Do you want some vacation?
A sick leave? Speak!
That's how you're thanking me?
How ungrateful!
I must be crazy or naive to trust others.
Remember: no happiness without work.
The hell with you all!
What's going on here?
Do you want me dead?
Who's the boss?
Who's giving the orders?
May God poison your blood!
Ahmed... Ahmed!
What's happening to you?
My pills...
My pills for my blood pressure...
Who's your man, me or my brother?
Bitch!
Come here...
Come here, come here...
I have a message from grandma.
Go back home...
Or a lady with silver teeth is gonna eat you!
The lady with the silver teeth is a victim of the wolf.
Come on! Hurry!
Don't touch me!
Go! Go! Andiamo!
Come, all of you!
I'm coming!
Come on, get out! Andiamo!
Good!
Life is beautiful, isn't it?
Everybody to the station!
Everybody to the police station, except the sick!
Do what he says, don't resist the cops.
It's good, kid.
It works well.
You're like a son to me.
You're like a brother to me.
Are you sending money for my sister?
The first day of each month.
I'm also sending some for your house.
The foundations are finished.
Today...
You and Robert, are everything to me.
Dzamila...
Come closer!
From now on...
Perhan is the boss.
Obey him!
And not my brothers, understood?
Understood.
Little sir!
Are you looking for someone?
They're mine now.
Look! Look!
Kid... Go tell Ahmed that his brother Sadam isn't crazy.
I won't rot in jail for him!
I leave it to Zef!
After all, he's the elder.
He's the one who should go.
Ciao, bello!
My brothers can go to the devil!
Buy some other children who will work for us.
Find a pregnant girl.
It allows us to smuggle them in.
I'm finally an established man!
Make a selection.
Nurses, a dwarf...
God bless you.
The house being built for me...
Where is it? Can I see it?
Near mine... of course!
We're brothers, you and me.
But don't get near the construction site.
Why?
The lawyer warned me.
The one who got your passport.
It's a fuss over there.
It's on radio and TV.
They made a movie about children trafficking.
Don't go.
Take the Bari-Bar ferry and go to Bosnia.
I want to see grandma, Azra, and my sister in Ljubljana.
No, it's too dangerous!
The police is investigating.
Here are some addresses.
Go south, to Sarajevo and Tuzla.
And find me a wife.
I repudiate Dzamila.
One you like.
Not skinny or wrinkled.
Safe travel!
Bari-Bar!
Come here. Come here!
I didn't want to upset you last time. Forgive me.
I told you I'd come back.
My god! Millions!
No need to kiss my feet!
For me?
My God, my God!
The great businessman!
He accumulated a lot of gold and silver!
He won a fortune to put it at my daughter's feet!
My God!
Is she married?
No, she's not married.
What could I do?
She's a woman!
She wouldn't listen.
She went gallivanting, she had fun.
I don't know what to do with her.
I'm wondering.
I don't know what to do with her anymore!
What about the child in her belly?
Maybe yours.
What about you?
What do you think of it?
Ask your uncle!
My God... What did you do to me?
He came, Mother...
A dark train...
He came, Mother...
A dark morning...
You drink too much!
It's pointless!
Brandy is my specialty.
But it's useless.
Alcohol makes you soft in the brain.
Grandma...
Aren't you happy to see me?
Grandma loves you.
But what are you doing?
Don't worry, you're with me.
Somethings not right, grandma?
Thank God, I'm fine.
What about you?
Where's your sister?
In Ljubljana.
She'll come back soon.
Give me a brandy.
Why are crying?
Why is she crying?
The whore is sad.
Even whores cry.
Why wouldn't this child be yours?
I believe no one since I started lying.
God will abandon you if you stop believing.
This shirt?
Where does it come from? Where?
From the work of these hands.
And I built a house.
Who will live there?
You, grandma. And me.
I won't live there.
God doesn't want me to live there.
I can't live there.
No! Don't say that!
You were honest.
You're a disgrace.
What happened to you?
Tell me, grandma!
You were grandma's little one!
You're not anymore. You're rotten!
My son... I'm telling you.
Life is just an illusion
Me... Fate can take me tomorrow.
So I'm giving you back your money.
Ah! Why are you doing that?
You're hurting yourself!
My God! My God!
You're destroying yourself!
Stop the music!
You'll drive him crazy!
Step back!
Perhan! Wait!
Come back! You're drunk!
What are you looking at?
Go back to your homes!
It's my neighbour, not yours!
Light!
Scales!
Stove!
A present from the best man!
Let's open it!
Silence!
A bread!
Ah! Gold!
Here's the limousine!
The limousine!
The driver is opening the door.
The groom is helping the bride to get off.
He's taking her in his arms!
Let's applaud!
The step-mother... gives some bread and sugar to the bride for a long and sweet life.
The newly-weds are kissing!
The step-mother takes the bride to the house.
We're slashing the groom to give him strength!
He'll need it!
Grandmother and grandson are dancing!
Look!
He's handsome, cultured and proud!
You're still grandma's love.
Get up! Come! Quick!
You and Ruza, find me some lame persons.
And find a pregnant girl.
With that and Azra's baby,
I'll have two incomes.
I can't believe it.
Are you serious?
Do you really want to sell your own child?
Misfortune will strike you!
This child isn't mine.
There'll be no bastards in my house!
I accepted to marry her at this condition. Understood?
Here. No one must see us.
Hi!
Hi! Are you building another house here?
If it was the case you would see it, wouldn't you?
With God's help... our children will go to Italy.
They'll work and get rich.
And they'll honor us.
It's their turn.
I'm old.
I can't work anymore.
Thank God they're young.
Tell me... about Merzan.
He's lazy.
He's only interested in women and gambling.
Do you want me?
Leave me alone.
Understood?
I'll wait.
May they come back safe and sound.
I'll see their child and I'll be able to die in peace.
You're hurting me. Why?
You know why.
A pure race isn't a bastard!
He's working so hard!
Maybe I'm bothering you.
Forgive me for saying all this.
But talking is calming me down.
I have worries.
My worthless son is roaming
God knows where, then comes back home with a sorry face and goes out to see girls.
I'm ashamed to say that.
Honestly...
I don't really know what to do with him anymore. I really don't...
But my Perhan! May God protect him!
There's no other like him.
Fortunately, he's not like my son...
God curses him!
If you knew what a beautiful daughter I had!
A true beauty.
Perhan looks like his mother.
Really.
She died young.
And because of that...
I almost lost my health.
What else can I say, my friend?
This kid is my whole life.
My whole life...
Still alive?
Here, eat!
You must believe me, Perhan.
This child is ours.
I was three months pregnant when Merzan took me.
Shut up! Don't lie!
I'm not lying.
I won't raise a bastard!
We'll sell him and we'll have our own child! Understood?
Give me your hand.
This child is ours.
We made love during the
Saint George celebration.
That's when it happened.
I planned everything.
I know that he's a bastard.
We'll have our own child.
No need to argue any longer.
I swear that he's ours!
One second!
I'm deeply distressed.
I dreamed that you were giving birth... to a white bird and that...
I'll be right back.
What do you want?
You did well. But...
Where is my new wife?
You came back empty-handed?
What about my new house?
Why did you lie to me?
Did you go back there?
Where could I find you a wife?
I thought...
What did you think? What?
That you'd pick one on the way.
I don't know.
You know everything, Ahmed.
You always know everything.
Why did you lie to me?
It's Sadam who lied to me!
I sent him the money for your house.
And it kept it all.
I had no idea.
I'm sorry but it's not my fault.
It's true!
I swear!
Believe me or go away.
And let me die.
You'll get one half of my house.
Here. Take these papers.
We'll call the lawyer tomorrow morning.
I may not have much time left.
What about Robert?
I loved him more than my own life.
But now...
I'm not so sure.
The more I look at him... the more I find him suspicious.
His eyes, his nose, his hands...
Nothing like me!
But we have one thing in common: our wives cheated on us!
A boy! Congratulation!
Cover him, quick!
Look, Perhan!
A boy! A bull-calf!
May God protect him!
No, Azra! No!
No, don't die!
For the love of God! Azra!
Dear grandmother,
After all, life has no meaning.
God just punished me.
He saw me hide my booty.
He waited until I made a fortune.
Then, he suddenly darkened my horizon.
He sent a storm spread out my money and my gold.
First he gave me happiness.
Then he punished me by taking everything away.
I had enough gold to build a big house.
But now,
I'm the victim of a tragic fate.
I don't understand.
The more I try to understand, the more my brain is muttering and truth is getting away.
Dear grandmother,
Your words must have become a curse.
When I said that
I wouldn't believe anyone anymore, you told me:
"God will abandon you if you stop believing".
"You're not serving God or man".
It was true. And here I am.
Deceived by the man
I believed in with all my heart.
Ahmed was like a god and a father to me.
I told you that Danira was at Ljubljana hospital.
Now I know that evil can confuse our minds and make us believe what isn't.
I found out that Ahmed kidnapped Danira for his own profit.
Dzamila!
Where is he?
- Gone.
- Where?
Who knows? He left me!
Dzamila... Tell me!
He made peace with his brothers.
They left together!
You took my sister to Ljubljana.
Where are they?
Speak or I'll kill you!
Leave him alone!
R... Rome!
Rome!
Have mercy for a poor woman...
Luck, work, love...
- Did you see her?
- No, signore!
No, niente bambina.
Fucking gypsy!
Fuck off, you gypsy bastard!
You told me not to come back without Danira.
I searched the whole world but Danira is nowhere to be found.
I've been looking for Ahmed for 4 years.
Even if it takes 4 centuries, I'll find him and tear his heart out.
My dreams have shattered.
And what's a gypsy without dreams?
A roofless church...
A silent church tower.
Your Perhan.
Danira!
Perhan!
Brother!
My God!
I finally find you!
Your leg? How is it?
Still the same.
Go on... Eat.
Do you know what happened?
What?
Ahmed's brother was lying about the hospital in Italy.
In fact, he kidnapped me.
And he forced me... to become a beggar for him.
The brothers made peace.
He's getting married today.
Ahmed?
Yes.
Adm you, you have a son.
He just turned 4 years old.
He looks like you.
Do you want to see him?
Perhan!
What?
- What's your name?
- Perhan, and you?
Perhan.
Liar!
It's not true!
Quick! Before Ahmed sees us!
Hug him. He's your father!
I'll be right back.
No, don't leave us.
I'm going to buy a present for grandma and I'll be right back.
Buy her a sponge.
Don't forget my accordion!
No!
I'll be back before the train departure. Take that.
What?
I'm sad.
Don't be stupid.
Daddy!
Perhan! Wait!
Daddy, I'm mad at you.
Why?
You won't come back.
And you won't buy me an accordion.
Gypsy’s word!
Come on, get back inside!
Get back inside!
Irfan! Irfan!
Perhan? Is that you?
I need help.
No problem.
What do you smoke?
Good cigarettes!
Go on guard.
You can count on me.
Good luck to you two!
Ahmed! Come and dance!
Oh! The little Prince!
Look, Ahmed!
But it's Perhan!
My little boy!
I'll serve you until I die.
You're my father. I love you.
Take me back or kill me.
Kill you? Why?
Punish me.
I had some bad thoughts.
Take him. Give him something to eat.
He's declining.
Who is he?
Nobody! A simpleton!
Eat some cake! Eat!
Die, squirt!
Take me to the bridge. Hurry!
I'm gonna kill you!
You spoiled my wedding!
Go away.
Go away!
You ruined my life.
Now it's my turn.
I'm gonna kill you.
Even if you change into a bird!
Fly, you dirty bastard!
Richard, say, kudos.
Wow. You found some essential truth in that staging.
Yeah?
Absolutely. Clearly, it's about Vietnam.
He suffers from suburban existential...
It's about whatever you want it to be about.
Richard, we loved the play.
You understood it, huh?
Perfectly.
I'll talk to you later.
You aced it.
You aced it.
I'm sorry. I don't know your name.
Pam.
Pam? This is Shelley, my girlfriend.
Hi.
Hi. How are you?
I'm Richard and I'm thirsty.
So we'll talk to you later.
Bye-bye.
That was a fine, fine play.
Really. Absolutely.
Hey, Shelley, I gotta go talk to this guy, okay?
What is happening?
This is for you from all of us.
Hey, Shelley! Thank you.
Shelley, look at this.
Wait a minute. What happened here, did everybody sign this?
Yeah, everybody signed.
Fabulous. Thank you.
Where'd you sign this?
I signed it inside.
Good, I got some news.
There was an agent in the house tonight, and he says he thinks this play might be good enough for Broadway.
All right!
Yeah. I know.
Let's keep our fingers crossed.
Let's all have some cake.
Penelope, great!
Okay. Now, I think this thing that we ought to do here is...
Everybody get a piece? Here you go. Let me trade you that.
I think we shouldn't cut the mask.
We save those for later.
Hmm?
Come back to me.
Who was she?
I never saw her in my life.
What'd she give you?
Oh, my God.
Is this a party or what?
Let's have some cake.
How was the play?
Did you enjoy it?
Are you all right?
A-ha!
"A-ha," what?
"A-ha," where ya goin'?
I'm going on a trip.
Where?
I have no idea.
What about the play?
Well, it isn't done.
Okay. When will it be done?
I don't know.
Oh, my God. Richard, there are people waiting for that play.
Is Jill going with you?
No. I don't think so.
We broke up.
The Red Sox are at home tonight
for a Comiskey Park game against the Yankees.
The Cubs are just beginning a West Coast swing...
How long will you be with us?
Just tonight.
Fine.
If you'll sign in here, sir.
Sure.
Arthur, 313, please.
Have a pleasant stay. Thank you.
Okay, thanks a lot.
This your first time here, Mr...
Collier.
Yeah. For some reason,
I never got around to coming here.
I always heard how nice it was, though.
When was that?
About eight years ago.
See, I used to be a student up at Millfield College.
Yeah, the students come here now and then to enjoy the restaurant and the rooms.
It seems to me, I remember they had a graduation prom here back in '47, was it?
Really?
You been here that long?
Why, I've been here since 1910.
Uh-huh.
Came here with my parents when I was five years old.
Really?
My father was a desk clerk.
I used to drive him crazy playing ball in the lobby.
He got so mad at me sometimes.
I'm lucky I lived to be six.
Three, George.
Got yourself a nice view here.
Let me see.
Great.
Okay, let's see now.
Here you go.
Thank you, Mr. Collier.
If there's anything I can do for you, just let me know.
My name's Arthur and I live in the bungalow behind the hotel.
Okay. Thanks a lot.
See ya around, Arthur.
Have we ever met before?
Have we ever...
No, no. I don't think so.
No. No. I'm sure we haven't.
Have a nice stay here, Mr. Collier.
Okay, thanks a lot.
Sir?
Yeah, when do you open?
In about 40 minutes, sir.
Forty minutes?
Yes, sir.
Arthur! Hi.
Yes, Mr. Collier.
Arthur, you know, in the Hall of History, there's a photograph, a young woman.
There's no nameplate.
Yes, that's Elise McKenna.
She was a famous actress in her day.
Starred in a play in the hotel theater.
I'm sorry. Did you say there was a theater here?
Down by the lake.
Really?
When was this play done?
Oh, um...
Hey, Arthur!
Arthur. Hi. Listen.
Could you take my luggage and put it back in my suite? Great. Thanks a lot.
And can you tell me where the nearest library is?
In town.
Right past the church.
Great. Look out.
Thanks. Terrific!
Thanks a lot.
See you around, Arthur.
Yeah.
Yes.
Oh, my God.
"One of the most revered actresses on the American stage,
"for many years, she was the theater's greatest box office draw. "
"Under the guidance of her manager, William Fawcett Robinson,
"Elise McKenna was the first American actress
"to create a mystique in the public's eye."
"Never seen in public in her later years,
"apparently, without an offstage life,
"the absolute quintessence of seclusion. "
Excuse me. Do you have any theater biographies that aren't in the racks under the rare books or magazines?
Well, we do have some magazines, but they're in the back, and
I'd have to find them and...
Could you do that for me, please?
Well, all right.
Thanks. I'm in the back.
Okay.
Great!
Here you are.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Yes?
Hello, yes. Miss Roberts?
Yes.
Hi. My name's Richard Collier.
And I just read your book on famous American actresses, and I really enjoyed it a lot.
What is it you want?
Information about Elise McKenna.
What sort of information?
Well, I'm a playwright and I was thinking about doing a play based on her life.
And of course I'd have to talk...
I'm sorry.
Ma'am, please.
Please, don't.
This is not for a play,
Miss Roberts.
This is something very personal.
I don't understand.
Where did you get that?
She gave it to me, ma'am.
At the opening night of a play that I wrote at Millfield College about eight years ago.
That watch was very precious to her.
She never, never left it out of her possession.
It disappeared the night she died.
She died that night?
Won't you come in, please?
Thank you.
I have some things I've been saving for the theater collection.
That was a costume from one of the plays she was in.
Miss Roberts, what was she like?
When I knew her, she was kind and thoughtful.
But she was just too much within herself.
She seemed empty somehow.
Well, she wasn't always that way, was she?
No, not at all.
People who knew her when she was young said that she was quick and bright and full of fun.
Strong, willful, not at all the way she was later.
What made her change?
I don't know, but the change seems to have taken place about 1912.
After she performed in a play at the Grand Hotel.
That was her manager,
William Robinson.
Was he really as strange as you seemed to indicate in the book?
There was something strange about their relationship.
Wow, look at this.
Hey. May I?
Of course.
This is incredible.
This guy, Finney. He was my philosophy teacher at Millfield.
Really?
Yeah.
She read that book over and over.
She had that made.
What is it?
That's my favorite music in the whole world.
I don't understand what's happening.
Dr. Finney?
You'll have to walk with me, young man.
I have another class.
What's your name?
Collier, sir.
Richard Collier.
Student?
Yes, I was, nine years ago.
Well, I try to make my classes interesting, but nine years?
What can I do for you?
I have a question for you, sir.
Shoot.
Is time travel possible?
That is a question.
Let me tell you something, Richard, is it?
Yes, sir.
I was in Venice in 1971.
I was staying in a very old hotel.
But I mean, very old.
The structure, the furnishings, everything.
The atmosphere was aged, if you follow me.
And my room,
I felt as though it was a century or more earlier than 1971.
You understand?
Yes, sir.
So, in other words, then, the location is very important.
Not all important, but essential.
The rest is here.
One afternoon, I...
I was lying down in that room.
All the sights around me, a part of the past.
Even the sounds I heard, and I conceived a notion.
What, I asked myself, if I attempt to hypnotize my mind?
Suggest to it that it isn't 1971, but 1571.
I closed my eyes and fed a suggestion into my brain.
It's August, 1571.
I am in the Hotel Del Vecchio, and I spelled out the details for myself, and did it over and over, and again and again and again.
And?
Well, I'll never really know, Richard.
I've never done it since.
And I'm not sure I'd want to do it again.
I felt exhausted afterwards.
Completely washed out.
And if it really did happen,
I was only there a fraction of an instant, remember.
A flicker.
Yes, sir. I understand that.
But you were there.
I thought so.
It was imperfect, granted.
How would it be otherwise?
There were objects around me that were clearly from the present, and I knew they were there.
Oh...
If I were going to try it again...
Mind you, I have no such intention, but if I did,
I would disassociate myself entirely from the present.
Move everything out of sight that could possibly remind me of it.
Then, who knows?
Sorry. Hey.
Hi.
Hi, how do you do?
Listen, do you have 1912 money?
I mean, very specifically, 1912.
A-ha!
That's it.
All right. Let's see now.
Yeah, not too bad.
Yup, yup, yup, yup.
It's looking all right.
Good evening, Miss McKenna.
You don't know me, but you will.
Evening, Miss McKenna.
You don't know me, but you will.
Okay.
It is June 27th, 1912.
Oh, boy.
You are lying on your bed in the Grand Hotel, and it is 6:00 p.m. in the evening of June 27th,1912.
Your mind accepts this absolutely.
It is 6:00 p.m. on June 27th, 1912.
Elise McKenna is in this hotel at this very moment.
Her manager,
William Fawcett Robinson,
is in this hotel at this very moment.
Now. This moment. Here.
God, how stupid.
That's not very bright.
Both in the Grand Hotel on this early evening on June 27th, 1912.
6:00 p.m. on June 27th, 1912.
Elise McKenna and you.
Goodbye.
Elise McKenna, now, in this hotel.
She and her company, who are in this hotel at this very moment, even as you lie here on your bed
in the Grand Hotel on June 27th, 1912...
6:00 p.m., June 27th, 1912.
The stage is being set for their performance tomorrow night.
Your mind accepts this absolutely.
It is 6:00 p.m. on June 27th, 1912.
You have traveled back in time.
Soon you will open your eyes,
and you will walk into the corridor,
and you will go downstairs and find Elise McKenna.
She is in the hotel at this very moment.
Damn it!
There's no question in your mind.
It is 6:00 p.m. on June 27th, 1912.
That which you think becomes your world.
Your mind accepts this absolutely.
It is June 27th, 1912.
It has to happen!
You know that now!
You know it.
It has to happen.
There is no question.
You know it.
It has to happen.
Relax. Accept.
Relax and accept.
Shut up!
Yeah, not bad.
Great.
Hey. Look at these pictures.
I'll bet they're a hundred years old, if they're a day.
Look at this furniture.
Isn't that nice?
Yeah.
What a place.
Yeah? You like those?
It's beautiful.
They're yours.
I'll bet this is all crystal.
You suppose it is?
Yeah, it must be.
Look at the rest of the place.
It has to be.
Look at here, the original picture?
Yeah, but look how much they've been...
Arthur!
Arthur? Arthur?
Arthur?
Arthur! Come on.
Wake up.
Hi, Arthur. I'm really sorry to wake you up, but you're the only one who can help me.
Listen, you know those things in the Hall of History display cases?
Where do they come from?
Is there a storeroom or something?
Arthur, please. Where do those things come from?
The attic, Mr. Collier.
Shit.
Come on.
Here we go.
Twelve!
McKenna.
Yes.
I was there.
I was there.
It is 6:00 p.m.,
June 27th, 1912.
There is no question in your mind. It is 6:00 p.m.
Of course.
Room 416.
Room 416.
9:18, tomorrow morning.
9:18. 9:18, tomorrow morning.
Believe.
Believe.
Believe.
I made it.
Oh, brother.
I made it.
I made it.
Maude!
I'm back.
Are you ready yet?
No.
I don't know why you act in such a manner.
Indeed, I suspect you do not.
And what am I to make of that remark?
What you will, Rollo.
What you will.
Are we to have this maddening exchange each and every time
I notice the existence of a female other than yourself?
Notice her existence?
That scarcely describes your rapt appraisal of her every inch.
Rapt appraisal of her...
You just don't love me anymore.
Oh, Maude.
Christ.
I want to lie down for a while.
That's a good idea.
Great idea.
I warn you. I've had enough of this constant bickering.
That's what you always say to everything, "I will not discuss it."
That's your answer to everything.
Unless you come to your senses,
I shall leave without you.
Excuse me. Did you see someone just trying to get in here?
Yes, some young chap, ran that way.
I'll be damned.
I'd better report that.
Indeed, you'd better, sir.
I'd have reported it myself, if I'd known that there was...
Good afternoon, Miss McKenna.
You don't know me.
Good afternoon, Miss McKenna.
Good afternoon, Miss McKenna,
I've just come 68 years.
May I please speak to you?
Yes?
Yes, monsieur?
Um... ls Miss McKenna here?
No, I'm afraid she's not.
Could you tell me where she is?
I'm sorry,
I have no idea, monsieur.
Strike one.
I beg your pardon.
Getting out?
Not inside, Arthur.
Are you Arthur?
Yes, sir.
Here you go.
Arthur, not inside.
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
I say, I shall have her!
Not in my life, you shall not!
Whatever you desire,
I guarantee you satisfaction!
Be out of here within two hours after the show's over?
That's impossible. The man's insane.
That's what he wants.
You know Robinson.
I wish to God I didn't.
All right, if he's that anxious to get out of here, let him doff his fine coat and help us tear down the set.
What?
Sorry.
Have you seen Miss McKenna?
You have a message for her? Give it to me and I'll see it reaches her.
Now, as for our precious Mr. Robinson...
Madam, I do not so regard her.
Yes, you do.
And you shall not marry her.
And I say, I shall have her.
Not in my life, you shall not.
Give in, Cecily.
It's not your place to say.
Desist!
Good people, this is a comedy, not King Lear.
Let's not bury the playwright before his time.
Excuse me!
I'm terribly sorry to bother you.
I wonder if you know where Miss McKenna might be.
Very well, very well.
Let us take it again.
From the beginning.
A yearly stipend, shall we say, paid for by the month.
Whatever you desire.
Hello.
Take it again, Madeline.
Why not put her on the scale and sell her by the pound?
May I speak to you, please,
Miss McKenna? May I...
May I please speak to...
Miss McKenna. No. No.
Elise, may I...
Oh, boy!
Miss McKenna.
Good afternoon, Miss McKenna.
Uh...
I'm, um... Flustered, my sweet?
Never seen an actress en déshabillé before?
Uh, I'm looking for
Miss McKenna, please.
Most likely walking by the lake, my dear.
Thank you.
Oh!
Watch it, sonny.
Sorry. Excuse me.
Is it you?
Is it?
Yes.
Are you all right?
Yes, yes, quite all right.
I'm sorry if I startled you.
No, you didn't startle me.
I think I did.
I'll take you in to dinner now.
May I speak to you, please?
Anything the matter?
Who was that young man?
I've no idea.
He gave no name?
There was hardly time.
You were conversing, McKenna.
No.
Well, not really.
No, no need to look back.
He's following us.
Keep on walking.
I'll be right along.
Are you a guest here, sir?
You're Robinson.
Are you a guest of the hotel?
Uh...
Yes. Yes, I am.
Then I must ask you to stop annoying Miss McKenna any further.
If you do not, I shall see that you're put out.
What did you say to him?
What I've always said to men of his sort.
That gown of yours in Act 2,
I'm not crazy about it, you know.
It'll have to be redone.
Warn Marie that I shall discuss it with her later.
Good evening, reservations for four under Woods.
Woods. Yes, monsieur. What time was the reservation for?
8:00 p.m.
8:00 p.m.
Monsieur, may I help you, please?
I'm dining with Miss
McKenna, thank you.
Good evening.
How are you, sir?
I told you, we should have gone to Poughpeepskie.
Poughkeepsie.
Poughpeepskie.
And I just won't discuss it any further.
It isn't the lines at all.
If only these actors would...
Isn't he the nincompoop who thought he could do Hamlet last season?
Mon chéri, we meet again.
Yes, hello.
I so admire a man not hidebound by the dictates of fashion.
Ma'am?
That suit.
I haven't seen one like it for a decade.
A decade?
Yes.
Still looking for Miss McKenna?
Yes, in fact...
Over there.
Thank you.
What do you think you're doing?
Dancing with you.
But we don't even know each other.
I know everything about you.
Yes, I'm sure you do.
What do you mean?
If you will excuse me...
No, you don't understand.
I think I do.
No, no, please, don't leave.
You have no idea how far
I've come to be with you.
There's no need to be afraid of me, you know.
The man's an intruder.
Will you kindly see to it that he is escorted from the premises?
If you will, sir.
One moment.
I shall go with him.
McKenna.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Don't worry, William.
I shall return momentarily.
Thank you so much.
I was so embarrassed...
Your name, please?
Richard Collier.
Your place of residence?
Chicago.
Your occupation?
I'm a playwright.
A playwright.
Yes, but I'm not here because...
And you say that you know everything about me.
Well, yes...
Which is patently absurd.
You couldn't possibly know everything about me.
We've never met. You're a complete stranger to me.
But then, why did you say, "Is it you?"
I don't have to answer that.
I know you don't.
I wish you would, though.
What is the matter with him?
He's just looking out for me as he has always done.
But why is that?
Do I look dangerous?
Wait. Wait.
When can I see you again?
I don't know.
And have it ready by tomorrow morning.
I'll do my best.
Smiling, McKenna?
Seems appropriate.
Rather handsome young man, if ill-mannered.
I'll keep an eye on him.
I'm sure you will.
Is he the one, William?
Is he?
Only you can tell for certain.
Now, tomorrow night's performance.
Remember, stay ahead of them.
Keep the mystery, always the mystery.
Excess within control.
Sleep well, McKenna.
All right.
Who is it?
Richard Collier.
Good morning.
You sleep all right?
Wonderfully.
I'm sorry.
I didn't sleep too well either.
But I was on a porch chair.
So, you know...
Don't you even have a room?
Yes, I will at 9:18.
Room 416.
I mean. Would you like to go to breakfast?
At 6:00 a.m.?
Well, later?
I don't eat breakfast on performance days.
No, of course not.
Lunch?
Mr. Collier!
No, no, no.
It's not Mr. Collier.
Isn't that your name?
Well, yes, that's my name, but...
What?
Marie. She's sleeping in the other room.
Marie?
My maid.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
Well, of course my name is Mr. Collier.
But I was hoping you'd call me by my first name, Richard.
Why should I?
I don't know.
Just hoped you would.
When can I see you today?
I shall be rehearsing all day.
All day! That's crazy! You can't...
Don't wake her up.
Will you walk with me?
Can you do that much?
I can't.
Young woman, if you do not walk with me, I shall go mad, positively insane and do crazed things to myself.
Walk with me. Please.
Say, "Richard," that's me.
"Thank you. I would love to walk with you and talk with you and get to know you
"and not be afraid of you and resolve everything."
Say, "Yes."
Yes.
Outside the hotel.
She's crazy about me.
Can I persuade you to join me?
Where are you from, Collier?
Chicago.
Where are you from, sir?
I'm given to understand that you're a playwright.
You understand correctly.
No doubt you dream of seeing Miss
McKenna in one of your opera.
That's plural for opus. I presume you've written more than one?
Mmm.
And seen them produced.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
I'm not entirely unacquainted with the achievements of the American stage in the past decade.
Perhaps I've seen one?
No, I doubt it.
I also doubt very much that I shall ever see one graced by Miss McKenna.
You don't really believe that's why I'm here, do you?
Why are you here?
Is it money?
I don't think you really believe that either.
There is a law, Collier.
I warn you. I will not hesitate to make avail of it.
Yes? On what charge?
The matter's concluded, sir.
No.
Yes.
You may depend on it.
Good morning, sir.
Good morning.
Excuse me. Arthur!
Forgive me again, sir.
I'm very sorry, sir.
That's quite all right.
I'd like a room, please.
Oh. Don't you have one?
Well, I was rather ill when I arrived last night. So I stayed with a friend.
Ah, I see.
You do have a room, sir?
Yes, yes.
Thank you.
One single. $3 a day.
Bathroom privileges extra.
Would you care to sign the register now, sir?
Um...
Excuse me. I'm sorry. Are you sure this is the right room?
The right room, sir?
I don't understand.
I'm sorry, Mr. Biehl.
That room is reserved.
Forgot to put a notice in the slot.
I'm very sorry.
Right, shall I sign?
Would you, please?
Excuse me.
Let me just finish that for you.
Grand Hotel.
I'm sorry...
Thank you, sir.
Bingo.
I beg your pardon?
Oh, nothing.
Which room is your luggage in, sir?
Um...
It's no problem.
I can get it later myself.
Thank you very much.
See you around, Arthur.
Morning.
Morning.
Astonishing.
Hello.
Hello!
You look lovely.
Thank you.
Shall we?
Certainly.
Sorry I'm late.
Complications.
What did you do to your face?
Shaved.
New blade wasn't quite sharp enough.
I shudder to think what you'd look like if the blade were any sharper.
No. I don't believe it.
Gotta give him credit.
He's like a bulldog.
Would you like me to speak to him?
Wouldn't do a bit of good.
I think I know what would, though.
Whoa! Wait for me!
Whoa!
Mr. Collier, it isn't easy being a successful actress.
Over the years, I...
I found it necessary to protect myself.
So understand, please understand.
That I'm even with you today when we only met last night.
Why did you say, is it you?
I was expecting.
Me?
Someone.
Who?
Tell me.
I think you'll laugh.
Why? Is it funny?
In a way.
William told me you were coming.
Robinson?
Yes.
He knows somehow.
He really does.
He knew a lot of things before they happened, my career, my...
He told me that one day I would meet a man who'd change my life.
Did he tell you that man would be someone to be afraid of?
Yes.
And what do you think now?
Do you...
Do you believe that?
No.
You're obviously not.
That's beautiful.
What is it?
That's Rachmaninoff, from the Rhapsody.
I saw him with the philharmonic once.
I love his music, but I've never heard this piece.
Really? Well, I'll introduce you to it sometime.
Sorry we had the carriage so long.
Thank you.
See that guy's face?
They're gonna hang us for horse-napping.
Stick out your tongue.
Huh?
Stick out your tongue.
Why? No.
The most peculiar moment in my life, Mr. Collier.
I think you'll survive it, Miss McKenna.
What time is it now?
Um...
Well, I must be getting back.
You have to? Can't you stay a little longer?
No, I have to rest awhile.
The play.
It's lovely.
Where did you get it?
It was given to me.
Well, shall we?
So, when's the company leave?
Tonight.
Where are you going?
Denver.
Well, thank you for a most pleasant afternoon.
Could we talk just a little longer?
I really should rest awhile.
Please.
Very well, then.
Just for a moment or so.
What did you want to talk about?
No.
Oh, my God.
What's happening?
McKenna?
McKenna?
Come in.
I think you'd better go.
Have you been waiting all this time for our return?
This is hardly the time for discussion...
Have you?
Yes.
Does that surprise you?
Our relationship is strictly business.
Strictly business?
I'm involved with you as an actress,
Mr. Robinson, not a doormat.
Do not attempt to wipe your boots on me.
Richard.
I shall leave a ticket for you at the theater door.
"Excess within control," McKenna?
Au revoir.
Good evening, miss.
Not good at all.
Particularly bad.
I'll not go downstairs again.
What is it, miss?
I've just been dining with the man my father is determined that I wed.
Banker Harwell.
Banker Harwell, yes.
All 67 years, and 5'4" of height and several hundred pounds of him!
He does have money, though, miss.
And never lets a soul forget it.
I'm amazed he has the least desire to marry.
He's so happily wedded to his gold.
Perhaps he won't be that bad, miss.
There must be something you like about 'im.
Yes, his absence.
The man of my dreams has almost faded now.
And what man is that, miss?
The one I have created in my mind.
The sort of man each woman dreams of in the deepest and most secret reaches of her heart.
I can almost see him now before me.
What would I say to him if he were really here?
"Forgive me.
"I've never known this feeling.
"I've lived without it all my life.
"Is it any wonder, then,
I failed to recognize you?
"You've brought it to me for the first time.
"Is there any way
"that I can tell you how my life has changed?
"Any way at all to let you know what sweetness you have given me?
"There is so much to say.
"I cannot find the words,
"except for these,
"I love you."
And such would I say to him if he were really here.
What in God's name were you doing?
Nothing.
Nothing? Rewriting the entire first scene?
I got it back on course.
Elise, hold a moment.
We've just got to take that photograph.
Very well. Just a moment,
I have to change.
Quickly!
And a little flourish.
Yes, yes. Yes, very pretty.
Very pretty. Just one moment.
Here we go. I'm just going to focus on that lovely...
Yes, yes, yes! I'm just going to put in the plate.
One moment.
There we go.
A little smile, please.
Not quite. Perhaps if you think of something happy or bright.
Yes, that's it.
That's it. Hold it.
Perfect!
Absolutely perfect.
I say, I shall have her!
Not in my life, you shall not.
Mr. Collier?
I am the one who loves her!
For you.
Neither do you.
I can provide her with life's enrichments, rather than the riches of life.
I think an old song says it best.
Do you have any notion how many years
I have been with Miss McKenna?
Since March of 1903.
March, 1903.
That's correct.
She was 16 at the time.
There she was on that dingy stage in that pathetic play.
Total radiance.
It only took seconds for me to realize exactly what she had to be.
Mrs. Robinson?
Do you actually believe that I have nurtured her, cared for her, molded, taught, developed her for all these years merely to groom a wife?
What, then?
A star.
Only someone with the limited awareness of your age could possibly conceive that my entire passion for this woman is no more than physical!
Are you incapable of understanding that she has it within herself to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest actress of her generation?
I owe you an apology.
What?
I understand you now.
You have nothing but the best motives in mind for her.
And you...
But so do I.
Of course, she'll continue to act, she will continue to grow and she will become everything you want her to be.
With you at her side?
Yes.
With me at her side.
Never.
My God.
You really think you own her, don't you?
Collier, I know who you are.
Ever since you came here,
I've known from the start.
You came to destroy her.
God, you're out of your mind.
No more.
No more?
One curtain call?
The audience will be furious.
Marie, did you find him?
No, Miss McKenna.
Did you try his room?
He wasn't there.
What did they say at the desk?
They have not seen him.
He left no message?
No, I'm sorry.
This makes no sense at all.
What could have happened to him?
Marie!
Marie, help me change.
Quickly.
Wait, Marie.
Thank you, Marie.
Your performance in Act 1,
I must say, was somewhat eccentric.
Where is he?
What have you done to him?
I've done nothing, McKenna.
Mr. Collier has left.
That's all.
What do you mean?
Gone.
From the hotel and your life.
I don't believe you.
I must admit, he was somewhat more charming than others that we've encountered in the past, you and I.
A trifle more sincere, perhaps. Still...
Then he was not the one you spoke of?
No.
Then you were wrong about him, weren't you?
You were wrong.
I love him and he's going to make me very happy.
Do you understand?
I love him.
What difference can that make now? He's gone.
I'll find him, William.
Don't you dare try to stop me.
Now, if you will excuse me while I change.
Of course.
May I remind you that we leave within the hour?
Thank you.
Elise!
Elise?
Elise?
Sir?
Are you all right?
The company, are they gone?
Company?
The ones who did the play last night.
Where are they? Are they gone?
They left as soon as they were packed, sir.
Come along, Arthur.
We'll be late.
Richard!
You all right?
Yes.
I thought I lost you.
Never.
Never, never, never!
Mm-mm-mm!
You will marry me, won't you?
Sorry.
You won't?
Sure.
I was just laughing at the way you asked, that's all.
For one moment there...
What?
I thought you had a wife and children back home somewhere.
Elise.
I want to be everything to you.
You are.
You are.
Tell me more about yourself, my love.
Well, I was born in...
What sort of plays do you write?
Are there parts in it for me?
I could...
I would love to act in one of your plays, assuming that I ever want to act again after tonight.
You will.
Richard.
Good plays.
What?
I write good plays.
I never let you answer, did I?
No.
Sorry.
What time do you think it is?
I don't know.
I don't care. I love you.
Don't look. Fine.
It's 5:00.
Really?
I don't feel sleepy somehow, do you?
No.
The first thing I intend to do for you...
You've already done.
Well, the second thing, then.
What?
Buy you a new suit.
I don't understand.
Nobody seems to like my suit.
Well, can you blame them?
Wait a minute. I think my suit's terrific.
What's wrong with this?
So what if it's 10 years old?
At least 15.
Fifteen?
Mm-hmm.
Well, I think it's fabulous.
Let me show you.
It's a really great suit.
It's in first-class condition.
The sleeves fit.
That's pretty good for me.
My arms are about nine feet long.
And it's got pockets everywhere.
I can pull rabbits outta here.
Yeah, this is the best part. This is a special coin compartment for...
Richard?
Richard?
Richard!
Richard! Richard!
Richard!
Richard!
How's traffic?
And the road conditions are pretty good today.
You really shouldn't run into any problems,
except on the inbound
Kennedy at Jackson,
there's a three-car accident with injuries
right at the center of the roadway.
Traffic is backed up from Ohio to Jackson...
No. No. No!
No!
No!
June 29,1912.
It's June 29, 1912. Oh, God.
Oh, please.
June 29. I'm back.
I'm back. Oh, God.
June 29,1912.
No!
Mr. Collier?
Are you sure he's in there?
Well, the maid says he's been in there for days.
Are you all right, sir?
Use the passkey.
Mr. Collier?
Oh, my God!
Let's get him on the bed.
All right, easy.
Careful, careful!
I got him.
Better take his legs.
All right.
All right, over here.
Okay.
Easy.
Operator? Get Dr. Paul up to Suite 313 right away.
Looks like he hasn't eaten in a week.
You better send for an ambulance.
I'll call one right now.
What a shame.
If I'd only known.
Operator?
Get an ambulance.
He is gonna make it, isn't he?
I don't know.
They're on their way.
How is he?
We're gonna need some oxygen.
We've got some downstairs.
I'll get it right now.
Keep him warm with this blanket.
Looks like he hasn't eaten in a week.
What a shame.
I wonder what happened.
Gotta keep him going until they get here.
Gladys, this is Arthur again, in Mr. Collier's suite.
We've got to get that ambulance...
DFU, EGYPT
A REALLY LONG TIME AGO
RIGHT BEFORE LUNCH
(woman) Ema Hesire,
I know you're in there.
The wedding has been all arranged.
Oh, please, gods.
Please get me out of this.
You turned down the jeweller, the grain merchant.
You turned down the Pharaoh's food taster.
There's only one man left who'll have you.
You are going to marry Hazzi-ra.
So what does he do?
He's a fuel merchant.
- Mother.
- All right, so he sells camel dung.
- Forget it.
- You forget it!
Mother, I don't want to settle down.
I want to do things, invent things.
I want to try things that nobody's ever tried before. I want to fly.
And I want to smoke and tell your father to go to hell.
Oh, Emmy, Emmy!
If I thought we women could in any way change anything, don't you think I'd encourage you?
No, no, no, no.
These are the times we live in.
Mother, there's got to be a better way.
Please, gods. Please help me find it.
The Nile is overflowing.
There is a wheat shortage.
The Pharaoh has haemorrhoids.
The gods have bigger things to worry about than you.
Whoa!
Emmy! Oh!
Emmy? Emmy?
Oh, Emmy.
Oh.
("In My Wildest Dreams"
by Belinda Carlisle)
- In my wildest dreams
- In my wildest
- In my wildest dreams
- In my wildest dreams
I'm out of focus, have a twisted picture
Of the wonderland where I was goin'
Kept regrettin' all my glib sidesteppin'
Until you were sent to me
In my wildest dreams
- I never knew
- In my wildest dreams
Anyone who could move me like you
And do what you do to me
Oh, baby
The sweet collision,
unexpected moment
When our eyes
connected with each other
Once I'd felt your touch
The magic meant so much
I gave my heart to you
In my wildest dreams
- I never knew
- In my wildest dreams
Anyone who could move me like you
And do what you do to me
PHILADELPHIA, TODAY
What would you say if I told you you get more beautiful every day?
Huh? What was that?
Arms and legs? Oh, God, how thoughtless. I'm sorry.
("My Girl" by The Temptations)
- I've got sunshine
- I got sunshine
- On a cloudy day
- On a cloudy day
- When it's cold... Oh, she needs a tan.
- When it's cold outside
What do you think?
Speak up. Don't be shy.
I got the month of May
- Wrong sex!
- I guess you'd say
- You say
- What can make me feel this way?
Now, that's the ticket! Nothing beats a great pair of legs, huh?
- You'd say
- What can make me feel this way?
- Popeye look.
- My girl
- My girl
- My girl
- Talkin' 'bout my girl
- My girl
- I got so much honey the bees envy me
- I got so much honey
Oh, the bees envy me
- I got a sweeter song
- I got a sweeter song than...
Boss! Oh, great.
I was just comin' to see you.
You know, you could get the Dummy of the Week award, Switcher.
- She turned out pretty real, didn't she?
- I wasn't talking about her.
Oh. Well, what do you think?
It only took me six days.
I could turn out three, four of these a month.
You're supposed to knock off three or four a day, Switcher! Get back to work!
What about quality, boss?
Style and grace? These things take time.
That's it. You're fired!
Fired?
OK, but can I finish her? You see, I'm a sculptor, trying to be a sculptor, and she...
Beat it! Now!
Here you go. Have fun.
You guys having a good time?
Having fun at the party?
That's my boy!
Here you go.
Just one second. Here you go. Bye-bye.
Hey! Want a giraffe for the birthday boy? Huh?
Monkey? A pony? A tiger?
- How about a hint?
- I want the big one, stupid.
Sorry. That's the official Flights of Fancy balloon. A poodle?
Listen, biscuit brain.
My old man's paying for this party.
One giant balloon coming up.
There you go. Have fun.
Now... what do you want?
Daddy!
Daddy!
Hey, biscuit brain!
What the hell are you doing?
Take your hands off my kid!
My balloon! You're fired.
(boy) Whoa!
- Trimmin' hedges long, Switcher?
- Oh, actually, no.
I'm really a sculptor. But, uh, there's not too much work for us these days.
No reason why hedges can't become art, though, huh?
You're fired!
Get your paycheck and get outta here!
- What do you think?
- What do I think?
I'm fired! Pick up my paycheck. Get out.
No severance. Never come back.
- Oh, look. The Road Warrior.
- Hi, Roxie.
His Jag's in the shop.
Hi.
- Be nice if you had something with doors.
- Oh, come on.
- Where are we going to dinner?
- I'm not that hungry.
I thought we'd grab a hot dog, go for a walk, look at the moon?
- You lost your job again.
- I didn't lose it, I know where it is.
- It's just somebody else has got it.
- Oh, jeez. Can we go?
- Good night, Mr Wert.
- Nice work, children.
- Who's that?
- BJ Wert, the regional manager.
He is Illustra.
Now can this bucket of junk go?
Yeah, I'm trying.
- Oh, good night, Roxie.
- Good night!
Must be nice havin' your own limo. You can go from any funeral right to dinner.
- (engine starts)
- Ah!
This job at Illustra's destroying your sense of humour. Get a grip!
I'm not the one that can't deal with reality.
Reality is very disappointing.
Jonathan, I care about you, but if we sleep together tonight it will confuse things.
- I think you should see a professional.
- You mean a hooker?
- No, a psychiatrist.
- I can't afford a psychiatrist, Roxie.
Well, then, call one of those shrinks on the radio.
They're only good for little problems that fit between commercials.
Good night, Jonathan.
Roxie, what... Roxie!
(thunder)
Rox!
Oh, my God. It's you!
I wanted to take you home, but they didn't let me.
You are the first thing I've created in a long time that made me feel like an artist.
Oh, no.
Whoo!
See you tomorrow!
Good morning. What a gentleman.
They're putting up the sign!
How fun! Yoo-hoo!
It's a scoshe crooked!
Isn't this exciting? A customer lined up to get into our store.
- Tell me, do you like our new sign?
- It's very nice.
- You really been here a hundred years?
- Not personally, but the store, yes.
It was built by my grandfather,
Tough Teddy Prince.
My father ran it until he passed away recently.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Well, he was very old.
And he died the way he wanted to, in women's lingerie.
- Pardon me?
- Heart attack in the women's department.
Excuse me. They don't have that sign quite right yet.
- Oh, look out!
- Hey, sorry, man.
Watch yourself, ma'am.
I got it!
Maybe.
- Young man, I'm sorry!
- No, that's... Oh! No problem.
Aah! Oh!
- If I can make it up to you in any way...
- Yeah! I could use a job!
- What do you do?
- Anything.
- When can you start?
- Uh... As soon as I finish this.
Yoo-hoo, young man! What's your name?
- My name? Uh, Jonathan Switcher.
- You're hired!
Thank you. My lucky day.
Every time I walk through these doors,
I feel like I'm home.
I practically grew up here.
Greta Garbo used to get her make-up right over there.
Of course, you probably don't know who Greta Garbo is.
Sure I do. Ninotchka, Grand Hotel.
I don't sleep much at night.
Neither do I. At least, not in the two weeks since I've been in charge here.
I don't know how we're going to make this store great again!
Looks fine to me. What time do we open?
We are open.
Oh.
Well, I... I'm sure things'll pick up by lunch.
Yes. Uh... BJ, it's all going according to plan.
I mean, it's like a ghost ship around here.
They're gonna be beggin' to sell this place within a month.
No. No, Timkin is no threat.
Well... BJ. Beej. She's here.
Mr Richards, do you know what this young man just did?
- Uh... Shoplifting?
- He saved my life.
Those incompetents you hired nearly got me killed.
If I were paranoid,
I'd swear this was sabotage.
Claire, it's not as if I was turning away Harvard graduates.
If you know someone you feel is qualified to work here...
Yes! Jonathan Switcher!
Let's show him our gratitude.
- Well, five dollars should do it.
- No, no. I want you to give him a job.
Take good care of him.
Well, uh... Switcher?
What kind of work experience have you had?
Oh, I've had just about every job there is. Briefly.
I'd like to do something creative.
Maybe with, say, mannequins.
Please. Uh, listen. I pride myself on being able to size up a job applicant and see just what kind of executive potential he has.
I have just the job for you.
(Roxie) So you got a new job.
That's terrific. What is it?
Let's just say that thousands of dollars of merchandise go through my hands every day.
- I'm takin' you for a celebration dinner.
- Those panties, up to Lingerie.
- Panties. Right. I'm into it.
- Did you say "panties"?
- Panties?
- I can't talk now. Pick you up at eight.
- See you then.
- Bye.
I've seen him pick you up.
That little... pissant!
You can't tell me that he's satisfying you sexually.
- That's none of your business.
- I would like to make it my business.
I would love to sink my teeth into your... little bottom.
What? What, what?
Did Armand say something bad?
Forgive me!
English and me, it's new.
My tongue, it slides.
Look, our relationship is strictly business. You got that?
Yes. Of course. I have some reports to get out by noon o'clock.
Agh!
- See anything you like?
- Just lookin' for panties.
You found them. However, you missed the lingerie department by four floors.
- Well, get going.
- Right.
Asshole.
What was that?
Oh, nice hall.
I must be losin' my mind.
I guess all artists fall in love with their creations, but you just seem so... special.
Oh! Well, roll over Bill Shakespeare!
That is the sweetest sentiment
I ever heard.
- Uh, no, no. I was rehearsing a play.
- I always find it best not to explain.
It adds a certain mystique to one's reputation.
No, no. No. I'm...
I'm a regular kind of guy, OK?
Don't disappoint me.
When you finish your conversation, please bring her to window three.
Sure. You got it. I'm Jonathan Switcher.
Hollywood. Hollywood Montrose.
Whoo! Doesn't it just sing?
Oh, it sings, yeah.
I'm a window-dresser here.
We're going to have fun, fun, fun!
I am so glad you're working here!
- You are?
- Why, of course I am, honey.
I never thought they'd hire anyone stranger than me.
(hums)
- (dog growls)
- Oh!
Halt!
- Identify yourself.
- Jonathan Switcher. New stock boy.
Yeah. Mr Richards told me all about you.
I am Captain Felix Maxwell, night security commander.
It is my responsibility to secure the perimeter here at... Prince and Company.
I didn't know there was danger of invasion.
There's no danger of nothing as long as me and Rambo are on patrol.
- Rambo?
- Yeah.
I call him that because he likes to draw... first blood.
Just what is your assignment here tonight, boy?
- I'm helping Hollywood with the window.
- Oh, the little Mary has an assistant, huh?
- Where do you people come from?
- Ohio.
- Ohio?
- Yeah.
You mean they got 'em in Ohio?
So, you like your new assignment?
Could have been worse. Could have put me on with a bigoted jerk.
Hold it there, boy!
Did you have anybody particular in mind?
Do you think he meant anybody in particular, Rambo?
Oh, don't let Felix get to you.
He just has a bad case of Miami V)ice.
Listen, I gotta go, OK? I promised my girlfriend I was gonna take her out, OK?
- (screams)
- What? What happened? What did I say?
Albert left me, the bitch.
He said my thighs are too fat.
- Do my thighs look too fat to you?
- No.
- You didn't look!
- I don't know about men's thighs.
- They look fine to me. They really do.
- Thank you.
Albert called me Cellulite City.
Maybe he's right.
Maybe I should have my hips lifted.
- If you wanna lose weight, just... diet.
- Oh, diets are no use.
It's those jelly doughnuts.
They call to me in the night.
"Hollywood! Come and get me,
Hollywood!" I can't stay away from them.
- Like you and women's dressing rooms.
- No, no. That was a misunderstanding.
Have any of your friends been vacuumed out?
I heard those doctors in Beverly Hills just open you up
- and suck those fat cells outta there!
- It... it sounds nice.
I wonder if there's any way you could do it yourself with a vacuum cleaner. Oh!
(sobs)
Albert's been off work for an hour.
There's no telling what he's...
Hollywood, Hollywood.
Hey, hey. Take it easy, OK?
Just go home and get yourself some rest. You'll be fine.
An artiste does not leave his work unfinished.
No, it looks fine to me.
In that case, I'm a dream that once was.
Look out, Albert, because Hollywood is on your case!
- Yeah! Go get 'im.
- Oh!
Good grief.
What's the matter?
Don't you like your new scarf?
Not especially.
- What a funny way to say hello.
- What the hell's going on?
My name is Ema Hesire, but you can call me Emmy.
This is a joke, right? Some sort of Prince and Company initiation?
- Who hired you? Hollywood?
- Nobody, Jonathan. You know who I am.
No, no. This can't be happening.
The sign! The electricity.
My brain synapses were destroyed.
I felt so sorry for you last night.
You looked so lost and lonely.
Last night you saw me?
Oh, no. You can't be her.
While making me, didn't you feel inspiration, like your hands were moved by a force not of this world?
You made this body so that I could come to life!
Tell me, am I in the twilight zone or just nuts?
- I'm so glad I picked you.
- I'd create someone who doesn't like me?
Tell me your life story.
It seems to have slipped my mind.
It's a long story.
I was born in 2514 BC, in Edfu, Egypt.
- I'll be 4,501 next April.
- I'll bake a cake.
I couldn't do anything. Know who my parents wanted me to marry?
- Who?
- A camel-dung dealer.
That would have been my guess.
It's stress.
I'm having a hallucination caused by stress.
Does this feel like a hallucination?
Come on. Let's go have some fun.
Food additives. It's food additives.
Jonathan! Come on!
(TV)) Except for early morning clouds,
the weather for the Philadelphia area...
Damn him.
Oh! Oh!
- What I could have done with these toys!
- You like to work with your hands?
Oh, yes. I love to build and invent things.
Back in Edfu I even made a pair of wings.
- And I'm sure you flew.
- That's right!
Well, almost.
You still don't believe I'm real, do you?
Uh... I'm open for discussion.
(nails ricochet)
Why don't we stick to good old-fashioned hand tools for the time being, OK?
- You've got good hands.
- Thank you.
I like the way they felt when you were putting me together.
Tonight we'll do something different, something this store has never seen before.
- I wish you weren't so worried.
- Easy for you. You're a mannequin.
You'll always have work. Me? I'm gonna wind up in the nuthouse after this.
Maybe insanity's covered in the employee health plan.
That's the dress
I should wear in the window.
- Hey, don't do that.
- You weren't shy when you created me.
You weren't so real.
Good God. Who are you?
(TV)) Oh, good morning, boys and girls.
I don't see Ziggy.
Oh, she's a big smiley elephant.
Hey, hey! Roxie, you look foxy!
Can I ride you?
- I'll be walking to work, thank you.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- Don't be silly. Don't be silly.
- Roxie! Wait!
I thought our plans were for eight last night. My mistake.
I gotta talk to you.
- We have nothing to talk about.
- Take a hike, wussy pants.
Roxie, I think I'm going crazy.
I saw things I know couldn't happen.
Where were you?
Did you sleep in the street?
- Prince and Company.
- Prince and Company. Your big job!
You know the mannequin that I made?
She's there, and she came to life and she knew who I was, OK?
You could have told me you just decided to stand me up.
Instead, you come here lying with this ridiculous story!
I'm not lying, I'm insane.
Armand, let's just get out of here.
Mom? When I was growing up, did I ever do anything really strange?
Yeah, I know I was always different.
Let me ask you this.
Is there any history of insanity in the family? I mean, Gran...
Grandma and Grandpa weren't half-brother and sister?
No, I'm fine, Ma.
Well, you know, you're alone a lot.
You know, you start inventing things. Ow!
Women, you know, a beautiful woman.
Enough about me. How are you?
You ever have hallucinations?
Roxie, this is America. You do not set the pace by redecorating.
- You demolish.
- Of course. I'll remember that.
We'll build the best Illustra yet on that site. And when I move up, someone will have to take my place here, huh? Huh?
- I'll be keeping my eye on you, Roxie.
- BJ, BJ, BJ! You won't believe it.
Prince and Company has the most incredible window.
I'm talking fab. People were lined up outside to get a peek!
I passed through on my way from a tanning session.
It's the most amazing thing I've ever seen.
- Really?
- Well, uh...
You know, it... it really wasn't that great. It was...
Um, it was interesting... in a jejune way at best.
I didn't care for it myself.
You know...
You should have seen it.
It was beyond brilliant.
There were 20 mannequins, with tennis rackets coming out of...
Beej, he's just a twerpy stock boy.
That window was a fluke.
Well, when I move up, somebody will have to take my place here, Richards.
But if you let that stock boy screw things up, it sure as hell won't be you.
I have worked on this deal too long to have it ruined by some snot-nosed punk.
I can handle him. I...
I meant you, Richards!
Of course you did, sir. But, you know, the board meeting is today.
I guarantee the sale will go through.
And Illustra, under your inspired leadership, will reach new heights.
Richards! Where in the hell did you learn to kiss ass like that?
- Did you take a class?
- Oh, no, sir, no. That's a God-given gift.
Beej? BJ, are you there?
Mrs Timkin, what possessed Switcher to create such a window display?
Did you see the crowds gaping on the sidewalk? It's an embarrassment.
Never you fear. Your Hollywood is here!
Rumour Control has it the board wants to fire your little behind.
Just let me at those so-and-sos.
I will straighten them out.
- How can they fire you?
- These are business people.
They won't appreciate an emotional appeal.
You're right. I was hoping to avoid this, but this is an hour of desperation.
This is not the way to approach this, OK...
You don't think so?
Don't tell anyone you saw me dressed like this. I have a reputation to uphold.
Buddy, I appreciate this demonstration...
Oh, that's it! A demonstration!
I will create a media event.
Call the newspapers.
The headline will read,
"If Jonathan is fired, Hollywood flies."
Excuse me while I step out onto the window ledge.
No. Hollywood!
- Hollywood!
- Whoo! Ooh!
- Come on. Get off!
- Ooh!
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.
- I get carried away sometimes.
- Not you!
Oh, that Richards!
He gives men a bad name.
- He said he would fix everything for me.
- Mm-hm.
What arrogance! That worm of a stock boy has affronted the dignity of this store.
I'll have it taken down and make sure that lunatic never works in this town again.
Shall we move on to the sale to Illustra?
Just a minute, Mr Richards.
I believe we're onto something here.
Maybe people will come to see our bold new window displays, and if they come to look, they'll stay to buy.
With all due respect, it's a little late for that, and we do have the firm offer from Illustra.
For one-tenth the value of the store.
Besides, I can't bear the thought of selling this place, especially to that awful BJ Wert.
We know how much the store means to you, ma'am, but...
Well, ten per cent is better than bankruptcy.
I think Mrs Timkin is right.
I move we postpone the sale for six weeks.
- I second the motion.
- All in favour?
All opposed?
This meeting is adjourned.
- Harris, would you bring Mr Switcher in?
- What? No, wait. I think...
Jonathan, good news.
We've not only decided to keep you on, but I'm promoting you to visual merchandiser.
You're kidding! That's great! What is it?
Just keep doing what you did last night, and you'll be fine.
Uh, Mrs Timkin...
I'm not sure I can do it again.
Last night may have been a one-time inspiration.
Oh, Jonathan, don't doubt yourself.
Go with it. Feel it. You're doing the job you were meant to do.
Well, you must lead a charmed life. It was all I could do to save your skin in here.
No thanks are necessary, Switcher.
Oh!
Good evening, Mr Richards, sir.
Felix, that new stock boy,
Switcher, has been promoted.
He'll be doing windows at night.
Keep an eye on him for me.
You suspect pilferage, sir?
I'd be happy to strip-search him.
You people that work at night scare me.
I just want you to let me know what he's up to, how he works.
Yes, sir. His MO.
Would you like that in a written report?
Oh, you write?
No. Rambo does.
- Just watch him.
- Yes, sir.
Come on, Rambo.
We have got ourselves... a mission.
(sniffs)
Jesus Christ, Rambo!
Hi, it's me. Jonathan. Remember?
Well, I guess it was just temporary insanity.
- Oh, ye of little faith.
- Emmy! You're back! I thought...
You remind me of my old boyfriend Chris.
He had no confidence.
- Chris? Who's Chris?
- Oh, just a sailor.
I told him that the world was round and I never saw him again.
Christopher Columbus?
You knew Christopher Columbus?
Uh-huh.
So, you didn't come directly from Edfu?
Oh, no. Along the way
I tried out different times and places.
None of them ever really seemed right.
Oh. You didn't happen to run into Michelangelo?
Michelangelo. Michelangelo. Oh, yes!
Oh, he wasn't very interested in me.
He was involved with a guy named David.
- Come on!
- Were you there?
Mrs Timkin loved what you did last night, but... they think I did it.
They want me to do more windows.
You gotta help me.
Of course.
You are magic.
("Do You Dream About Me?" by Alisha)
Where do they hide all the musicians?
- Let's dance.
- No, I can't.
Sometimes I watch you
while you're sleeping, baby
Sometimes I see you
hold your pillow tight
Am I the one
you're holding onto, honey?
Am I the one who's
in your dreams at night?
You tell me there's no other, baby
You tell me I'm the only one
I wish I knew for certain, baby
You say you love me, tell me, honey
Do you dream about me, baby,
when the night comes?
When you close your eyes
Oh, do you dream about me
when you dream of someone?
When you close your eyes,
who do you see?
Do you dream about me?
Sometimes I know
you really love me, baby
It's so much clearer in the light of day
Your touch is always reassuring, baby
You say the words
I need to hear you say
You tell me there's no other, baby
You tell me I'm the only one
But I want to know for certain, baby
You say you love me, tell me, honey
Do you dream about me, baby,
when the night comes?
When you close your eyes
Oh, do you dream about me
when you dream of someone?
When you close your eyes,
who do you see?
Yeah, do you dream about me?
I wish I knew what's on your mind
When will I see?
You're in my dreams every night
Do you dream,
do you dream, do you dream
Do you dream about me?
Ooh, yeah
Hey, do you dream about me?
When the night comes,
when you close your eyes
Do you dream about me
when you dream of someone?
When you close your eyes,
who do you see?
Dream about me
When the night comes
When you close your eyes
- Oh! Shake that thing.
- Hollywood, great.
I want you to meet somebody.
This is Em... my.
Oh, very nice. Maybe I can get
GI Joe and we can double sometime.
- No. You don't understand.
- Don't say nothing. It's cool.
It's obvious to this country girl that you're an A No.1 creative freak.
Imagine pretending to be a stock boy when you're a major artiste!
I am so jealous!
Now, some people may find you strange, but not me.
I respect that. Create, honey. Create.
I'll leave you two alone and go and meet
Albert for dinner. I hope he doesn't mind.
Mm-hm.
Just when I think you're real, you vanish.
What is with you? What's with me?
Didn't I tell you? You're the only one who can see me like this.
- That's not exactly fair, is it?
- Talk to them.
- (growls)
- You hear something, boy?
- (Jonathan) Wait a minute!
- (Emmy) What is that?
OK, Rambo. Get ready.
Attack!
(barks)
(whimpers)
Rambo. What?
- Stay there!
- Easy, Felix.
I don't think she's armed.
You can fool Rambo, but it won't work with me, Switcher!
My brain is quicker than a...
- Well, I think we've outdone ourselves.
- Yeah, this one's kinda fun.
- Ready?
- Let her rip.
Very nice.
- Morning, Mrs T.
- Oh, good morning, Jonathan.
What do you think?
It's hot, huh? I mean, meltdown.
Oh, yes. Hot. Smoking.
Burning, churning. Whatever. Oh, yes!
(phone rings)
- Hello.
- Hi, Jonathan.
- It's me, Roxie.
- I thought you weren't talking to me.
I wanted to see you, to know you're all right.
I gotta get some sleep.
I work nights now, OK?
All right. But get up in time for lunch.
I'm taking you to Chez Jacques
at one o'clock. You know where it is.
Yeah. I was fired from there once.
I almost burned that joint down.
It'll be just like old times.
And please, don't stand me up again.
- OK.
- Bye.
He'll be there.
Love that gal.
Hi, Hans!
I see you're wearing the night-time hair at lunch now. Looks good.
It's you! The flambé terrorist!
Will you not be satisfied till you burn the place down?
It was an accident, Hans. Just trying to show the customer a little flair.
- Jonathan!
- Hi, Roxie.
- You're here to dine?
- That's right.
By the way, the eyebrows are growing back nice.
- Sorry I'm late. I overslept.
- It's OK. You're only an hour late.
Just glad you made it.
I love this place. It's so romantic.
Yeah. Boy, they did a good job rebuilding the balcony.
It went up like a Roman candle.
Jonathan, it seems like
I was all wrong about you, and I have a way of making it up to you.
How would you like to be the chief window-dresser at Illustra?
- You're kidding.
- Word is out, Jonathan. You're hot.
Can you imagine being at Illustra? Ooh, Illustra.
- They want me?
- We want you.
Well, what if I told you I had a little help?
Oh, two of you?
Whoever he is, you can bring him along.
And what if I told you it was a very beautiful woman?
- I... I wouldn't mind. Not in the least.
- I can't do it.
- You'll start Monday.
- You're not listening.
You can drive me to work every day.
I miss that quirky little motorcycle.
- Roxie, I'm not taking the job.
- What? Why not?
If I'm one thing, I'm loyal.
Jonathan, you're not seriously turning me down?
I'm not the same guy I used to be.
I've found a place where I belong.
I'll see you around.
(screaming)
I'll get it! Don't panic! It's just a little one!
Bye, Roxie.
There's something strange going on in the store at night, Mr Richards.
Every time Rambo sees a mannequin, he gets so scared, his little pug tail comes right out his little mouth.
- Felix, you were in the war, weren't you?
- Airborne, yes, sir!
Did you jump from a plane and land on your face?
Yes, sir! I don't see what this has to do with little Rambo.
Isn't it obvious
Switcher is behind all of this?
- That skunk!
- I mean, a man who is an eternal failure is putting together the best window displays in town.
The bum!
You say you hear voices. No one's there.
- Just him and his dummies.
- Is someone helping him?
Is he a ventriloquist?
Some kind of mad genius?
Good questions all, sir.
- Find out the answers!
- Yes, sir!
- What about little Rambo?
- Screw your dog!
(whimpers)
Let's go, people. Clear out.
Clear out, lady!
Come on, Rambo. Tonight we nail that little fart blossom.
On behalf of Captain Clark and the crew,
thank you for flying with Eastern.
We hope you enjoy
your fun- filled stay in the Caribbean.
(Emmy) Oh, we deserve this vacation.
The sun feels pretty strong.
I could use some suntan lotion, if someone were willing to rub it on.
Well, it's a dirty job, but somebody's gotta do it.
We are alone.
OK.
So, listen. We find him, get a picture of whoever this woman is, and get out.
If we can't hire Jonathan, maybe at least we can buy her out.
I don't know about you, but I've always wanted to make love in the ladies' shoe department.
The smell of fine leather!
Aah!
Can I show you something in your size?
What? You mean you took me serious?
Oh, you're gonna pay for that!
(giggling)
Mayday! Mayday, Rambo.
OK, boy! Oh, baby!
Now, show 'em what you're made of.
- Go get 'em!
- (whimpers)
Rambo! This way!
This means a court martial!
- You hear that? That must be them.
- I wish it was us.
Come on. We've got them.
- Give up?
- Never.
Oh!
Ooh, Switcher.
You are one sick puppy.
So this is the young lady he dumped you for?
Nice.
Oh, beauteous.
I really should've listened when he asked me for help.
Ooh! Tell me, when you were making love to him, did he ever scream "Don't stop, Woody"?
- Ooh! Aah!
- (crash)
Oh, my camera.
No, this is how I... get my inspiration, I create.
I can tell by looking at you you're not the artistic type.
You know, Mr Richards told me to keep an eye on you.
But I think I'm gonna handle things my own way.
You wanna move your sweetheart?
That one was for Rambo.
Aah! Switcher!
This is for my mama!
Oh, Switcher.
Ow!
Oh! Switcher, I'm gonna knock you into the middle of next week!
- How'd you do that?
- I was behind him. He didn't see me.
Teach him to mess with a man and his mannequin.
Hm. Huh. Hm-hm. Whoo!
Wow!
Hey! Where'd you go?
Emmy!
Emmy!
Emmy!
This is your last chance.
We take him or we die tryin'!
I did it! I flew! I really flew!
- Are you all right?
- Terrific! Incredible! I feel great!
Did you see how high I was?
- I just had a thought.
- Hm?
You think we should name our first kid Pinocchio?
Jonathan, are you really sure this is right for you?
I'm positive.
What about you?
You've waited a long time.
How do you know you're not missing something better 5,000 years from now?
There could never be anything better than being here with you.
This is one guy who's never gonna leave your side.
The window!
Come on, come on.
- It's almost sunrise. We can't finish.
- Don't worry about a thing.
We'll never dress the mannequins in time.
That's right.
Absolutely scintillating. Beyond genius.
It sucks.
Fool.
(snoring)
Well, I don't believe it's lunch yet.
Let's not dally.
Felix!
- What happened?
- Well, why don't you tell me?
- Where's Rambo?
- (whimpers)
It's that Switcher. I caught him doing awful things to a half-naked dummy.
Is this your idea of a security guard?
- Claire, I assure you, I had nothing...
- You hired him, you fire him.
Well, what if he's telling the truth?
How can you think that?
The man is a lunatic, but I've never known him to lie.
He's right.
Mr Richards, this store has never been more successful and it's all due to Jonathan Switcher.
He can put a rubber glove on his head and run naked through the store,
- yelling "Hi, I'm a squid!"
- Hi. Morning, Mrs T.
Oh, hello, Jonathan.
This morning's window is your most brilliant yet.
- Thank you. What happened here?
- God only knows.
Felix, did you try and take Omaha beach all by yourself again?
- I was doing what Mr Richards told me.
- I never said...
Oh, is that right?
Well, Richards, when you take Felix to get his last paycheck, get your own as well.
Uh, Mrs Timkin, you may be our grande dame, but I've had serious doubts about a woman your age running this store.
- I'll appeal to the board.
- I can't see you appealing to anybody.
Don't mess with this old chick, mister.
Just pack it up!
Jonathan, let's go.
Get that dog outta the tree, huh?
Hey! You can't do this!
We'll file a grievance with the union!
We're not in a union, you idiot.
Oh, hi there, Jonathan.
I didn't know you were in there.
- Excuse me.
- Oh, that's lovely.
Mm-hm.
(Wert) What the hell are you people doing, huh?
Have you seen the latest figures, children, huh? Huh? Have you?
89 per cent! Sales are down 89 per cent!
Prince and Company is going through the roof!
All right.
Now, I want this to stop, children.
And if it doesn't, so help me, God, you are all dead meat!
Jonathan, it is my honour to inform you that, starting Monday morning, you will be the youngest vice president ever at Prince and Company.
- Congratulations.
- (all) Hear, hear.
- I don't know what to say.
- Say "Thank you."
- Thank you. Thank you!
- Long live Prince and... Company.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Son of a gun.
So, Richards was telling the truth.
I've been in this business 20 years.
Hell, half the guys in this store probably wear lace underwear.
But this!
We're talking a Sunday drive into some serious dementia.
Well.
- It's our move now.
- BJ, I would do anything for Illustra, but these pictures, they could kind of ruin his life.
Roxie, I'd never ruin anyone's life.
Well, I would, but only if it were absolutely necessary.
Now, Roxie, you're not developing a conscience on me, are you?
No. I don't think so.
Good. Anyway, I don't wanna ruin his life.
I just wanna hire him, and, uh... now I know how.
Hey, Gordon.
- Oh, Mrs Thomas. Hi.
- Please, Jonathan. It's all yours.
- Thanks. Men's room's broken.
- Of course, dear. Whatever you say.
- Oh, congratulations.
- Thank you.
You won't believe what Mrs Timkin and the board just told me.
- Vice president.
- Oh! Jonathan, that's wonderful!
Tina! Lupe!
He's talking to the dummy again.
Nobody deserves it more. I knew something like this would happen.
Creative freedom, practically my own boss. Maybe some World Series tickets.
I'm sorry. I'm going on and on.
You know I couldn't do this without you.
I won't take the job unless we can be together.
Jonathan, you can't worry about what will happen to us.
What does that mean?
Girls, please, let's not be catty.
I will not tolerate eavesdropping unless I'm a part of it.
I assume my Jonathan is in there.
You can't go in. He's got company, if you know what I mean.
And who do you think introduced them?
- She'll never say your hips are too fat.
- Oh, Hollywood! Jeez! Listen...
You know I would never bother you when you're getting a piece of wood.
But this is muy importante.
Your Hollywood needs help.
- Oh, what's up?
- I need your creative muse.
I've always thought of myself as hot stuff.
The very, very best at what I do.
But seeing you... Let's just say it. I am dirt.
Mould me. Shape me. I'm a fast learner.
Oh, please, Jonathan. Do not let them turn me out into that dark night, alone.
Hollywood, we can talk about designs and stuff, but when I work, I gotta work alone.
Of course. I understand perfectly.
You're an artiste, and that's the way you work. I can respect that.
Jesus. Hollywood, listen. Don't worry.
You can work as long as you want here.
I'm a vice president now.
- Who's crying?
- It's either our new vice president, the fairy, or the dummy.
(wailing)
Emmy, please. You gotta help me.
I can't come alive in front of Hollywood.
Besides, you can do it on your own.
But we're a team.
We do everything together.
You can't hold yourself back because of me. Now come on. Hollywood's waiting.
You'll do a masterpiece tonight.
Emmy...
I'll be waiting in the window.
Jonathan, how about a picture.
Mom will think I've switched.
- Hollywood, you're a genius.
- I am? Well, yes!
- OK, we need to make a list.
- Fire away.
- Uh, 30 feet of black nylon cord.
- Ow! Sounds like my kinda list!
Easy, sugar. Uh... OK.
You personally vouch for this guy?
He's worked at Prince and Company for 15 years. I think he'll be just fine.
I mean, he's an imbecile, but...
Oh, this is him.
Felix, come in. This is Mr BJ Wert.
Well, Mr Wert, sir!
It's fine.
Felix, there are hundreds of mannequins at Prince and Company.
Could you identify the one Jonathan
Switcher has a... romantic interest in?
Oh, absolutely, sir. I never forget a name or a face, Mr Nertz.
Good. Well, Felix, we need your help.
And if you succeed, you will have a cushy new job, right here at Illustra.
We want to get Switcher's mannequin out of the store and bring her here, secretly.
Oh! A covert operation.
I would be happy and proud to lead this mission, sir.
Good!
It's the most beautiful window I've ever seen.
- It's all you, you know.
- Not this time.
Every time. You're part of me now.
I've got you in here.
Come on. You ready to go?
- Are you really sure you wanna do this?
- Absolutely.
You've been cooped up in the store too long. Who cares what people think?
Just put your arms around me and hold on tight.
With pleasure.
Jonathan!
Look, Jonathan, I...
- I know about your problem.
- What problem?
You're riding around town with a mannequin on your motorcycle.
What is wrong with this picture?
Oh, right. You two haven't met.
Roxie, this is Emmy. Emmy, Roxie.
Nice to meet...
Oh, my God. What am I saying?
Jonathan, I wanna give you one last chance. Now, come to Illustra!
What is in this for you, Roxie?
An office with a view?
I don't need Illustra. Or you.
I got friends here, people who care.
And someone who makes me feel good about myself.
Bye, Roxie.
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- You'll be sorry!
You're making a big mistake!
Roxie.
He's out of his mind! BJ was right.
When I get that dummy,
I'm gonna tear her hair out!
Roxie, Roxie, Roxie.
You know what you need to do right now?
You need to put him and this nasty affair out of your mind.
Now, how is the best way to do that? Huh? Huh?
By having a night of distasteable sex with someone you care absolutely nothing about.
And proudly,
I would like to be that person.
Fine. Let's just go to your place.
- Really?
- Drive fast before I have second thoughts.
Armand is the wind.
Hey, Mr Richards. You better put some camouflage on, sir.
I am not going to put shoe polish on my face, thank you.
Now could we please get into the store, Felix?
Yes, sir.
- Oh! Look at him with the dummy.
- Who are you to criticise?
It's him! It's her! Ooh, that little prevert!
He's stealing her before we can!
Let's not do anything rash. We'll follow and find the right moment to grab her.
Don't worry. I'm an expert at surveillance.
Hang on!
- Where'd he go?
- That way. That way.
That is it!
No more of this surveillance crap.
Captain Felix Maxwell takes this from no mannequin.
Ah! Get us out of here before he gets out of the car!
- Hang on!
- I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.
You're finished, Switcher!
You may as well hang up your jockey strap!
No! No, Mr Richards! No!
- One-way street, you maniac!
- I know!
This is for you, Rambo!
- We got him!
- I want to get out.
- Geronimo!
- I want to get out.
Oh!
I don't understand it. This never happened to Armand before, never!
It must be you. You're so cold.
You're so... so unfeeling.
Where can I get a mannequin too?
(door slams)
(sobs)
(giggling)
(sighs)
Jonathan.
What are you thinking about?
- The window.
- Mm.
It turned out pretty well, didn't it?
It was breathtaking.
Emmy.
Ema Hesire, you inspire me.
I feel like I could do anything.
Windows are only the start.
I think we could design an entire city.
No one takes the time to build things that have character, dignity.
People need that.
We could give it to them.
I love you, Emmy.
I love you too, Jonathan.
I'd better get into the window.
That peckerhead doubled back on me.
I saw his motorcycle out front.
That dummy of his has got to be here.
Oh!
- This is the one! This is the one!
- You positive?
Abso-tively.
Wait a minute.
This one kinda looks like her too.
I've put my future in the hands of a vegetable.
Just get the mannequin.
Get... get the mannequin.
- (Felix) It's over there.
- (Richards) No, this is the door.
This is not the door. Oh, this is the door.
Oh, wait. Mr Richards, did you ever notice how they all sorta look alike?
Would you just look at that one?
Maybe this is her.
It's really interesting.
- It's clever, all right.
- This is art.
- It's like theatre.
- I get it. I get it.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
Good morning, starshine.
I sleep alone too,
- but I don't advertise it.
- Could you get my clothes?
Were you here all night?
You musta slept through it.
- What?
- (hums "Dragnet" theme)
All the girl mannequins disappeared from the windows last night.
Yes, my dear, your favourite, she is gone too.
Emmy.
Jonathan. Jonathan!
I'm sorry, baby. But us special people are destined for heartache sometime.
You know what works best for me?
Crying shamelessly. Oh!
Don't do anything drastic. Oh me, oh my!
OK, now. Wait. Wait a minute.
Yes, I shall cover you.
Whoo!
Yes. This is... Whoa!
Yes, indeed, oh, yes, girl!
Mm-hm. Jonathan! Jonathan! Wait!
- Roxie? Roxie Shield?
- Can I help you?
- Roxie Shield.
- She's in the boardroom.
- Thank you!
- You can't go in there! Security!
Jonathan! Well, we were hoping you might drop in.
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Where is she, Roxie?
She's perfectly safe. Jonathan, let's talk about your future here at Illustra.
I think it'll be wonderful to have the whole team back together.
- What'd you do with her?
- Relax. It's just a mannequin.
How does 55,000 a year sound to you?
- You...
- Hey, hey, hey, hey! All right! 60,000.
Beej, I don't think this man is of Illustra fibre.
- Where is she?
- You won't see her again.
- Where are you going?
- We also have a profit-sharing...
Switcher, we have extremely incriminating photos of you and that...
Well, get up, Richards! Get him!
Hey!
Sorry. Gotta run.
Security alert! Man in leather jacket!
Hey, come on! Get...
All units, code two.
Perpetrator on main floor.
Roger. Over and out.
Come on, Terminator.
Duty calls.
Excuse me.
Roxie!
- Call the police!
- The SWAT team.
- Oh! Hey!
- Go away.
- Felix!
- Oh, Switcher.
Terminator, lunchtime.
Get him!
- Nice dog.
- Shit!
Switcher! Switcher!
You're finished, Switcher!
Hey, Switcher!
Get me out of here! Get me out of here!
Watch it!
Put me down! Put me down, you idiots!
Switcher! I'm gonna get you, Switcher!
You're finished, Switcher.
Yoo-hoo! Boys!
Way to go, buddy!
Two things I love to do. That's fight and kiss boys. Come on, honey!
Come and get me, Sister Maryella!
What's the matter, honey?
What's the matter? Come on! Whoo-hoo!
Whoo! This is what being a man is all about, honey. Oh, yeah!
Hey! You can't come in here.
Emmy!
Mine's bigger than yours is!
When can we get that damned water turned off?
Oh, shit.
Go!
Just shoot him!
- Jonathan. You saved me.
- Oh, it's nothing, really.
- I'm alive.
- What?
He can see me and I'm still alive!
You are!
Thank you! Thank you.
- You're gonna have to love me forever.
- Oh, I always have, I always will.
Get out of the way, doofus! Damn it!
It's a miracle. A miracle!
Ugh!
Stop it! Ugh!
Ugh! Little creep! Stop! Stop touching me!
Ugh! Get away from me!
Please don't touch me! Ugh!
Roxie.
- Jesus, it's the heat!
- Hollywood.
Now, this is Emmy.
Mama, put the coins on my eyes, cos I sure don't believe what I am seeing.
There he is. Arrest that man.
- Who's she?
- She's who I came for.
She's the dummy!
(Wert) I said, arrest that man!
- Keep your hands off him.
- Claire, thank goodness you're here.
Oh, shut up.
BJ, you really screwed up.
- Claire, what are you talkin' about?
- When I fired this idiot the other day,
I replaced him with a fancy camera surveillance system.
I have Richards and this moron on videotape.
I was sure you were behind this.
You... you greedy snake!
Claire!
I want those two arrested for breaking and entering and grand theft.
- And I'll get you later for conspiracy.
- And you can add kidnapping to that, too.
- Kidnapping? Who?
- Me.
- Who are you?
- She's the dummy!
This poor man is having a breakdown!
- Get him outta here!
- No, no, she's the dummy!
- No! No!
- I... Please.
- She's the dummy!
- Please don't use force.
Mama! I want my mama!
Mrs Timkin, those video cameras.
Did they pick up everything last night?
I only saw what I needed to see!
- Just where did you come from?
- Uh, Roxie, you would never understand.
Mm-hm.
Uh, Claire, there must be some arrangement we can make, huh?
Cram it, clown.
- Come on.
- Oh, no, boys. Please!
You know, I see executive potential here.
Roxie, you're fired!
You'll never work in this town again.

ENHOH
Survival of the fittest, Son.
The law of the forest, right?
Right.
Of course, your new rifle gives you a little edge.
Dad, do you hear...
Be real quiet.
Lunch!
And I killed it!
Nancy!
Will you look at the size of this thing?
There's no way
I'm eating a dead rabbit.
I thought you said we were leaving.
Will this never end?
Start the fire, Nan.
We are leaving. Before lunch.
George, what happened to "home before dark. Grab a bite on the way"?
Come on, Nan, we gotta cook it.
It's Ernie's first kill.
Yeah, it's my first blood.
I hope you're proud of yourself.
Look, we'll stuff it. Okay?
You're a butcher, Ernie.
Back off, Sarah!
It was him or me!
I don't feel very good.
- Pull over, Dad, she's gonna launch.
- Ernest.
Open the window, honey, a little air will do us all some good.
It's the fish.
Ernie, close the cooler.
Ernie, what are you doing in the fish?
Looking for my baseball glove.
Hey, Dad.
Yeah.
Do you think I can get a pair of real major league baseball cleats when we get back?
You bet.
Great. I'm gonna spike Frankie McDowell.
No, you're not.
Listen to your Mom, Ern.
But he spiked me twice!
That's different. You go right ahead then. George.
Nan, you don't understand these things.
It's just smart baseball.
Hey, hey. Be careful of my drawings back there.
And don't step on the trout.
Or my flowers. They're still alive.
Or Mom's flowers.
Oh, Nan, don't you love roughing it in the wild?
"Roughing it," George?
The only thing rough about it was when the generator went out in the middle of Masterpiece Theatre.
Whoa!
George, please, slow down.
I know these roads like the back of my hand.
And I know Seattle's not going anywhere.
Want your sunglasses, George?
No, I'm fine, dear.
Mom, Ernie's playing with that gun again.
Ernie, don't even touch that gun.
It's a rifle, girls.
If you can shoot with it, it's a gun.
Oh, my God! Look at that deer!
Did you see that, Sarah?
No, I missed it.
I always miss everything.
Hey, Dad.
Yeah.
Maybe there's a chance you can blast something.
Ernie, don't give Daddy any ideas.
I could not face two stuffed bunnies.
Did I bring my rifle this time?
Did I? No.
You're right, George, we'll always remember this as our first camping trip when Ernie killed something and you didn't.
My God!
My God.
I thought I hit a man!
Is everybody all right, Nancy?
Okay, kids?
Sarah, are you all right?
Yeah.
George, what is it?
I don't know.
I hardly saw it.
But it's gotta be a bear.
Could it be a gorilla?
I don't think they get that big around here,
I think we should just get out of here, Dad.
What if it's still alive?
What if it's in pain?
If it's still alive, it's probably not in a very good mood.
No way it's alive!
You trashed him, Dad.
There's probably guts and eyeballs hanging off the bumper.
Knock it off, Ern.
We can't just leave it in the road, suffering.
Cool. Look.
Everybody, stay in the car.
Son of a bitch.
You drive a classic, you try to take good care of it, and some dumb animal...
George, shouldn't we call a Ranger?
No, not yet.
You did bring it.
Don't you need some backup?
No.
I said stay in the car.
This is exactly why I brought it.
For protection.
You didn't have to lie.
Shoot it!
It's dead.
Shoot it anyway!
Nan!
What?
I think you better come take a look at this!
Dad.
Yeah?
What if it's him?
Who?
Bigfoot.
Bigfoot?
Holy shit! Sorry, Dad.
That's okay.
I was looking for the right words.
It smells gross!
George, what is it?
I guess it must be a Bigfoot.
I don't know what else it could be.
Nancy, this is a big deal.
It's a major discovery.
I bet a museum would want it or something.
We have to take it home.
Ernie, you and your sister go take the stuff off the top of the car, put it in the back.
Right, Dad.
And tell your sister she's gonna have to help us lift this thing up!
Oh, Sarah!
Pull it forward!
Don't worry.
I feel so guilty.
What if it's the only one?
It's not as if
I tried to hit it, Nan.
It was just luck.
Luck?
What if we've just rendered an entire species extinct?
One of a kind?
This thing could really be worth something.
I don't believe you just said that.
Come on, Nan. It's all in how you look at it.
It's alive!
Dad!
Did you see those big honking teeth?
Ernest.
Get me my rifle.
George.
What are you gonna do?
Be careful.
It's still loaded.
George, you're not going out there?
We can't just leave it in the road, can we?
What if it's suffering?
Sorry.
It's dead!
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Are you really sure?
I'm really sure!
Remember, you were sure before.
Nancy, I'm not a doctor, but it has no pulse, it's not breathing and it's cold as a Popsicle.
Believe me, honey, whatever it is, it's definitely dead!
Help!
Somebody!
Help!
Ernie, get your mother!
Quick!
All right. I knew you weren't dead!
Not yet I'm not!
Not you, Dad, him!
Help!
George, what...
Are you all right?
Nancy, get my rifle, quick!
What...
What are you...
George!
Sarah, don't come in here!
Oh, my God!
Horrible smell!
Nancy, do something!
Be very careful.
What are you doing?
Oh, God!
That's brilliant. Come on, everybody, let's get out of here! Quick.
Come on, Sarah.
No!
Mom, my corsage!
No.
My orchid!
It's eating my fifteenth birthday corsage!
Sarah!
The one I saved for over six whole months!
I was gonna keep that flower for the rest of my life!
And you ate it!
Sarah!
I don't care how big and ugly and smelly you are.
You just can't go around eating other people's corsages!
That was a bad thing you did!
A bad, bad thing!
Do you hear me?
Even if you are an animal!
You just can't go around acting like one in this house!
Let's get out of here, now!
Boy, Sarah. You really pissed him off!
Shut up.
Shh! Both of you!
Come on, it's going in the dining room!
Wow!
That's great, that's just great!
George, he's eating my plant.
Look, he's eating my plants! No!
He's eating my
Passiflora coriaceas.
Stop that!
Oh, God!
Uh-oh.
Oh, dear.
Okay, that's it!
George! Can't we just call somebody?
George, what's that for?
I know what I'm doing.
Oh, George!
I'm not gonna stand around while some animal destroys our house!
Dad, it's not an animal!
George?
George?
I'm okay.
Everybody, get up here!
Quick! Quick!
What's it doing?
It's burying Grandma's mink stole.
Don't you look at me like that!
Why are you all looking at me like that?
I didn't kill the poor little things.
Grandma didn't kill them!
Some ranchers raised them and killed them.
And they only did that because they knew somebody would buy them.
Come on, quick, everybody back into the house!
All right, everybody out!
Uh-Oh.
Keep an eye on him!
"Keep an eye on him," George?
Lock the door!
Yeah.
George, he's coming back!
Stall him!
I can't! How?
I don't know!
Show him the pasta maker.
George!
Not yet!
George!
He really wants to come in now.
George!
Company!
Downtown. Sergeant Mancini.
Sergeant, my name is George Henderson.
I'm at 437 Manning Drive.
I wanna report a...
Something in my house.
What kind of something,
Mr. Henderson?
Some... A big... Something.
My family's in terrible danger.
In danger?
Mr. Henderson, do you have someone in your house?
A burglar, a prowler?
No, don't think I'm crazy,
Sergeant, but it's Bigfoot.
Of course, yes.
They can be a nuisance,
I'll tell you what,
Mr. Henderson.
It kind of happens all the time around here.
Now, we found these Bigfeet are pretty reasonable fellows.
Hey!
Look, I hit a Bigfoot with my car.
I thought it was dead.
I was gonna call in the morning, but it must have been hungry
'cause I found it in the kitchen!
You hit a Bigfoot with your car...
No! Yes.
in your kitchen.
Look, I'm under a lot of stress here,
I mean, it wasn't dead anymore. It must have just walked into the kitchen.
It was eating out of our refrigerator.
I thought it was gonna eat me, but it ate my daughter's corsage instead.
And then our Passiflora coriacea and then it ate our goldfish.
And where is it now, Mr. Henderson?
It's in the bathroom.
Of course, how stupid of me.
Hey, look, just say I believe you have a Bigfoot in your house.
First we cordon off your neighborhood.
Second, we evacuate your neighbors, and third, we send a whole shit-load of cops in there
to deal with the thing. I mean, fully armed and ready, Mr. Henderson.
So unless you wanna be responsible
for wrongfully turning your neighborhood into a war zone
I suggest you drop this whole thing right now.
A war zone?
Very well, then.
No, no, no Bigfoot here,
Sergeant. I was just joking.
Sorry, it's just a prank.
I'm not even George Henderson. You must have reached the wrong number.
We're on our own.
No, no, Sergeant, no Bigfoot here.
Irene.
Fine. Wonderful time.
What? No, wait!
It's Irene!
She's bringing the dog back.
I couldn't stop her!
I'll meet her halfway.
Nance!
It's no use hiding!
I know you're up!
Just take Little Bob and get rid of her!
Easy for you to say. This is Irene.
Oh, my God!
Look, we can't let her see this thing.
No offense.
The basement.
You'll love it. It's like a cave with a pool table.
Come on!
Nancy!
Nancy!
Beat it!
Come on, hurry!
Nancy! Yoo-hoo!
Quick, quick!
Let's go! Now's our chance!
Nancy, what...
This is it!
The beginning of the end.
Once Irene sees it, the whole world's gonna know.
I'll have to join a convent.
Nancy!
Marry a zoo-keeper.
I'll be a social outcast for the rest of my life!
I'll go to my prom, the kids will probably throw pig blood on me!
Thank you, Dad.
Sarah, don't let her in!
Come on, big guy.
Rise and shine!
Don't worry.
It's the safest place in the whole house!
Ernie!
It's okay, Mom, the stairs broke!
We're all right.
Oh, good.
There you are!
Amazing. That was...
Can you imagine?
Little Bob must be in heat or something.
Every dog in the neighborhood is out here.
My God!
What is that smell?
What the hell happened?
We decided to defrost the fridge.
Oh, God!
Is everything all right with you kids?
Us?
Oh, hey, fine.
Wonderful.
No. Great. Really great.
I got your mail.
Just put it on the fridge.
Nan, you wouldn't happen to have any peanut butter and brewer's yeast?
I found a new diet.
Sarah, please take the dog out of the room.
Peanut butter I know we have.
Is chunky okay?
Let me see if I can help you, Irene.
Peanut butter's always on the second shelf.
Great. No brewer's yeast?
No, sorry.
Never mind,
I gotta go to the market and pick up some cod liver oil and Tabasco.
It's a new energy diet. You might wanna try it, George.
Exercise, Irene.
That's the only diet.
Plenty of energy right here!
Well, maybe it's just rotten meat or eggs or something.
Exactly. No sense standing around breathing it.
Thank you for taking care of Little Bob.
Oh! Ernie!
What was that?
Ernie's experiment for his science class.
He's got one of those gerbils.
Yeah! It's so cute.
Only, it's more like...
A hamster.
Yeah, only bigger, and it's always hungry.
Nothing more than rats getting a lucky shake from society, if you ask me.
I know where you are if I need you.
Ernie!
Ernie, are you all right?
Boy, is this guy strong!
Ernie, give me your arms.
I'll lift you up.
It's Monday morning.
What am I gonna do about work?
You are going to call in sick, that's what you're going to do about work.
Dad's gonna just love that.
Can I be sick, too?
No.
I think you and Sarah will be safer at school, Ernie.
Oh, well. At least I can tell the kids at school my dad creamed a Bigfoot.
You're sick, too.
We're all sick.
No one's going anywhere until
I figure out what to do!
Get out of the fridge, Ernie.
Coffee?
Now, it took some doing, but...
At least for now it seems to be trapped.
It's okay!
So, how are you doing?
I don't know.
He's our little pet.
It's hurt.
Are we sure we don't have anything that doesn't sting?
Don't I wish.
Yeah, this is going to hurt a little, okay?
What I do is just close my eyes real tight. Like this.
All right. Okay.
Good.
Does this mean we can keep him?
Oh, grow up!
Maybe we can.
I don't know.
You don't know?
The answer is "No."
Now you know.
It was just so different when it was dead.
George, you were different.
And I'm convinced he wasn't dead.
Hey, hang on. I thought we were gonna sell it, and get rich.
Let's keep it and get rich.
Exactly.
I don't believe this family! Sorry.
We are talking about a living, breathing being here.
It might even be some kind of a person.
It's a Bigfoot person.
We don't even know what it is.
We don't know if it's male or female.
Definitely male.
How can you tell?
Oh, don't answer that, honey.
Never mind.
Nan, I don't know how, but we gotta figure a way to keep this thing.
It's big bucks, don't you see?
I mean, it's a ticket to a better life!
A better life for whom?
What about his life?
I'm thinking about us.
I just need time to figure away to...
Oh, well.
At least he's safe here.
You should not have given up, my old friend.
The only difference between these and those is I get a buck a strand for mine.
These are real, Doc.
I chased a set of tracks for two or three miles.
Okay, Jocko, if you've got castings, I'll buy them, but let's keep the price on the ground.
Listen, you don't understand!
I almost had him.
I was that close.
Then what, gun jam?
Or maybe a change of heart.
Had him in your sights and couldn't do it?
What's the story this time?
I don't know.
I think he was hit by a car.
That should have made it easy.
Yes, I know but...
There are no traces, no tracks, nothing.
He just vanished.
Well, like I tell my customers,
Bigfoot eat their dead.
I don't know why the hell I bother with you!
Because you figure I'm the only one who deep down wants to believe you, but I don't.
Not any more.
We both spent our whole lives chasing after that beast, and we both have to stare at ourselves in the mirror every morning and keep repeating,
"I'm not a fool!"
"I am not a fool!"
Only you finally blinked!
Or finally opened my eyes!
We'll find out soon enough!
Go for it, Jocko!
Raise a ruckus!
God knows, I can use the business.
Put the stuff in the freezer, honey.
Where is he?
Living room.
Everything is melting. Have I got something to show you.
George, give me a second.
Irene had us cornered out there for 15 minutes.
She invited us to dinner and bowling.
Bowling?
Don't worry, George, I spared you.
I told her you had something to drop off tonight, don't you?
Don't be so sure.
You might just change your mind when you've seen what I've seen.
Sarah, you, too.
Come on.
George, those are just empty calories.
Never mind about that.
No, no, no, no.
Not yet.
Just a minute.
I have a little something to show you.
But first, I want you to think about this just for a moment.
Us,
Life,
Time.
Magazines! Cover stories.
I mean, you could be looking at old Dad on the Carson Show, for heaven's sake.
No, no, no, no.
Now, we started with something kind of simple.
But I'm sure you'll see that as soon as he gets going there is absolutely nothing to stop him!
Sit.
Sit.
Sit!
That's great!
You taught him how to sit?
No, no, no!
Don't sit!
That was outstanding, Dad!
No, no, no. Stay. Please...
George, if I could have a word with you before the Carson Show calls.
Nancy!
It wasn't...
Nancy, honey, we've got to give him one more chance!
George Nathan Henderson, what is the matter with you?
This is our home! Our stuff!
Look, he had it perfect just five minutes ago.
George, you are acting like a crazy person!
Honey, that wasn't supposed to happen!
None of this was supposed to happen, but it did, and now we have to do the right thing!
I know it seems bad, but just give me one more week.
We don't have enough house for two days!
George, he doesn't fit here!
He doesn't fit in our lives!
Look, we have to do the right thing and think about him!
Mom, Dad, hurry, this is great!
What's the matter with him?
Maybe he thinks you're getting...
Now watch this.
Cool, huh?
He didn't care for the blue cheese.
eat your Pablum like a good boy...
and you'll have
Swedish pancake too.
Now I know where
Bonzo get his bad habits.
That's outright bribery.
Okay.
I'll take him back.
But you know it might not be so easy,
I think he likes it here.
What kind of a way is that to talk to a baby?
What do you mean?
She's gone.
It's time to go.
Remember this?
Your favorite station wagon.
Right. What's left of it.
No, no, no.
It's really much nicer on the inside. Come on.
Perfect.
Hungry? We're gonna have a little party.
Yeah. A goodbye party.
Plan B.
No problem.
See what we're gonna be missing?
Never mind.
Let's eat. Nancy?
Here. Ern.
Have you ever had a burger?
Smells good.
Look at this.
Mmm. Mmm.
Oh, right.
Yours was the fish. Here.
This is for him, the burgers are for you.
You want another?
I ordered wrong.
Double fish on a sesame bun.
Catch of the day.
Covered with tartar sauce.
How about some fries, huh?
Extra larges, two orders.
You can wash it down with a chocolate shake.
Look at all this stuff!
All you can eat.
Atta boy.
Great!
Comfortable?
Just sit... Stay.
Stay.
Stay right there.
You're not changing your mind, are you?
Your mom's right, Ern.
I know it's hard.
It's hard for me, too.
But it's the right thing to do.
It was wrong of me to think that we could just claim it like a stray dog.
He's more of a man than an animal.
You were the first one to see that.
He deserves to be free.
Mom's right.
He's gotta go back where he belongs.
So why don't you and me go on down there, like a couple of real men and say, "Goodbye, hairy friend."
Harry?
Since when does he have a name?
Since right now.
Harry.
Harry!
There's someone in the house.
What should we do?
You stay right there.
Good morning, Seattle.
Today Jerry's special...
You're free, Little Bob.
Go back to the wild.
Run, Little Bob.
Run free.
And now, your host,
the toast of the Olympic Coast,
Jerry Seville!
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Good morning, Seattle.
God, I hate this guy.
I'll turn it off.
No. Let me hate him.
It'll keep me awake until the coffee kicks in.
But I sure am glad it's Tuesday.
Isn't Monday the dullest day of the week?
Up yours, Jerry.
Seems old Jer was wrong.
All right.
This morning's paper.
By no means front page news.
Are you sitting down?
Listen, late last night a Hawthorne Hills man
discovered his wife lying unconscious on top of their car.
After the paramedics had revived the woman she said,
"She must have been put there by a huge, hairy, man-like creature
"resembling the legendary Bigfoot...
Harry.
"...who she had earlier mistaken for a mouse!"
Hawthorne Hills?
A mouse?
A mouse!
I gotta find him.
I can't go to work.
When do we ever listen to silly old Jerry Seville?
If there really was a Bigfoot, don't you think
I'd have had him as a guest on my show?
I gotta check it out anyway.
No, the very best thing that you can do is go to work.
What if somebody finds him before I...
All right?
See you tonight.
Bye-bye. Bye.
John Morrow, who will talk to us all about his new squid and prune juice diet.
Bigfoot.
Mom, he came back!
Little Bob!
It's amazing, you know,
I see an old Army buddy from 40 years driving along the freeway and, of course,
I cannot remember his name so I take his license number plate and I come here, and because of that I am going to find out where he lives. It's fantastic.
Ten bucks.
So how about you, George?
Did you see any Bigfoot?
What?
You know, your vacation.
Bigfoot?
No.
I read the things weigh over 400 pounds.
Smell real bad, too.
Hell, looks like we got one of those right here.
What's your shoe size, Billers?
Very funny.
I'm working with assholes.
Can I help you?
Probably yes.
I hope we can help each other.
I believe this is yours.
Okay, what are you selling, buster, huh?
Mrs. Henderson?
Yes.
Irene, would you go see if the tea kettle is just about to boil, honey?
Thank you.
Good morning.
Hi.
I am called Richard Smith.
And I'm from the U.S. Forestry Service and I'm investigating a possible road-kill, with an animal either killed or maimed in a car accident.
Now, I know that you did hit something on Route A-4 which was a little fire road off the I-90?
Yes. We did run into something.
What was it that you hit,
Mrs. Henderson?
I don't know.
We couldn't see it.
You know, it happened so fast.
Where is it now?
Now? I don't know.
It ran away.
Mrs. Henderson, obviously, our main concern are for your family, to be sure no one was injured.
No one was injured.
I'm so pleased.
Obviously our other concern is for the safety of that poor little animal.
It could be out there suffering and I know you would want to help me find it so I could care for it.
No. I mean, yes.
But I mean, there's nothing wrong with it.
It walked into the woods.
I mean, it didn't even limp.
Walked?
It crawled, it scurried, you know, it scampered, it kind of wobbled, creeped, like an animal does, you know?
Anyway, he's fine, and we are fine and...
You know...
I forgot I have a sink backed up and I...
And a potty.
I've gotta go take care of it.
Thank you.
Thanks very much for thinking of us and bringing this to us.
And thanks for your consideration.
License plates, huh? That guy's probably a convict. Here.
What you don't need now is somebody bothering you.
Just sit back and relax.
I can remember Herb's and my first fight.
This is nothing.
Can I help you?
Probably not.
This is the first place I have been.
I want some .458 magnums.
I think we got those in here somewhere.
Yeah. Here we are.
We don't get much call for these monsters.
$28.50 for the box.
Do you have any more?
There's 20 of them in there, you know?
Do you have any more?
I'm sorry, that's the last we got.
What, are you going on safari or something?
No. Just into my own back yard.
There he goes, just like clockwork.
Jeez, Dad, who the hell is that guy?
Jacques LaFleur.
He's always the first to show when these crazy sightings start up.
He bought some pretty serious ammo, .458s.
Before Sasquatch got under his skin he was a Class A hunter.
Where do you think Claws came from?
That guy shot Claws?
Yeah.
Why would he part with a trophy like that?
Probably because it was the smallest one.
May I help you?
Yes, I'm on my lunch break and I'm kind of in a hurry.
Could you point me to some books on the...
Bigfoot?
Sasquatch?
Sasquatch.
Sasquatch.
That's the one.
Fantasy, folklore, myths and legends.
Basement stacks. Take the stairs.
Thank you.
You could also try children's books!
Right!
This book sucks!
Ernie.
These pictures don't look anything like Harry!
He's right, Nan. It's no wonder people wanna kill them.
These books make them out to be monsters.
All except this journal from the North
American Anthropological Institute.
Some guy named Wallace Wrightwood.
That's him.
No. That's Jacques LaFleur.
He's a hunter who came into the store today.
No, honey.
This is Richard Smith, the forestry guy I told you about who came to our house today.
- That lying bastard!
- Mom!
Both of you, to bed, right now.
Sarah, get off that phone. It's two hours.
Come on, that's it!
Mom, it's only 8:30.
You mind your mother!
Hard to believe, huh?
And from the look in your mug, you think it's a load, don't you?
Everybody asks,
"Has anybody ever seen one?"
Let me ask you, you being a flatlander, a city fellow, you've seen hundreds, thousands of pigeons, right?
Of course.
Have you ever seen a baby pigeon?
Well, neither have I.
But I got a hunch they exist.
Are you Dr. Wrightwood?
I'm George Henderson.
Wrightwood ain't here.
Is he coming back?
He might.
Could I leave a message for...
How do you know Wrightwood?
His books. And his research.
He seems to be the only person who really believes in all this.
I just need a few answers.
Doctor's old, tired.
I'm gonna put my phone number down here.
Could you see that the Doctor gets this?
"Vital facts that could prevent an unnecessary and tragic end
"for the big fellow?"
I have a friend, a man named Jack.
And say there was this, this, giant... ls there a beanstalk involved in this, Mr. Henderson?
A beanstalk?
No. No.
I mean, with all these Bigfoot sightings what if Jack and his family opened up their home and their lives to this thing?
And, what if they found out that he was more human than animal, and they just said,
"We'll take him in.
"We'll accept responsibility for him until a safe place can be found for him to be."
Not some zoo, or lab...
So what you're saying is you would be willing...
Excuse me, Jack would be willing to take this creature in, care for it and love it like a pet?
No, no, like a member of the family.
That's a noble gesture, but impossible.
Sasquatch is a primitive ancestor of modern man, but if you ever came face to face with one you'd see that they're still very much animals.
Only on the outside.
Look, I know what
I'm talking about!
And I know it's closing time so if you wanna talk shop, then shop!
Jack and the Beanstalk,
George?
It just came out like that. I didn't know what I was saying.
I think you knew exactly what you were saying.
Face it, Dad, you want him back.
Sarah, I want to take him back where he belongs, but that means
I've gotta find him first.
By bringing Harry here we put his life in danger.
Now, we've got to try to set things right.
George, this is really Harry.
Did you draw that?
Yeah.
It's beautiful.
Hey! Hey, fella, get away from that window!
He's the person who saw it.
Now get this.
"It must have been the large hairy giant he saw running from the scene."
Did you get that, George?
Yeah.
George, do you still fool with that painting stuff?
Yeah.
As a matter of fact, I...
Good!
You can save your old man a few bucks.
How about you draw a big full-size Bigfoot?
We'll put it in the window right next to the gun section.
Now, you make him real big, you know, real scary.
You know, like they're supposed to be, George.
Hands up, big claws, big fangs, a lot of drool.
And let's put up a map of the area, and we'll mark on it all the spots where people say they've seen the thing.
We'll become kind of like a Bigfoot Central, a B.H.Q.
Dad, don't you think we might be encouraging a lot of unqualified people to go running around with loaded weapons?
Come on, you know as well as I do there's nothing out there to shoot at.
This is the first time my dad ever wanted me to draw anything and what is it?
A target for a bunch of blood-thirsty crackpots.
Come to bed.
No, really, it's the same old story.
One Christmas, when I was a kid,
I begged him all fall for a set of paints.
He ends up giving me a BB gun.
Like you got Ernie.
Yeah.
Come to bed.
No.
Honey, I can't.
I gotta finish this.
What's the problem?
If I make him look mean and vicious, people are gonna shoot first and then worry about the consequences.
It's like drawing a "wanted" poster of your best friend.
But if I make him look peaceful, the way Harry really is...
Well, that's just not what my father wants.
George, I'm so proud of you.
You don't know what to do.
If your father wants a Bigfoot, give him a Bigfoot.
I wanted King Kong, you brought me a goddamn giant gerbil.
I told you exactly what to do.
You didn't even come close.
Well, maybe it's right on the nose.
I mean, how do we know?
Maybe it's not vicious at all.
Maybe it's gentle, even has feelings.
Where did you dream up that shit?
Go stick a pin in Queen Anne's Hill, we just got another sighting.
Should have got a real artist.
I need one of those
Clint Eastwood magnums.
You got an M-16?
Anything that'll go fully automatic?
Fully automatic is illegal and it takes seven days to clear a handgun.
I'm afraid if you want a gun right now it'll have to be a rifle or a shotgun.
Anything with a night-scope.
Give me the biggest one you got!
Well, we've got some big guns and some big, big guns, but I'm afraid we're all out of big, big ammo! Who's next?
Look, pal, they just spotted that thing not three blocks from my house.
Where do you live?
What for?
It's for the gun.
Where do you live?
11484 Devon Drive.
Where was the sighting?
On the corner of Maple and Ogilvy.
What the hell's that got to do with it?
Where you going?
Son of a bitch!
See? You're not the only artist in the family.
How's that for an arthritic old shooter, huh?
What the hell did you do that for?
It was my drawing!
Why did you change it?
Hey, George. Cool down.
It's just a piece of cardboard.
Not to me!
It means something to me!
Can't you see that?
He means something to me!
What the hell are you talking about?
The hell with it! I quit!
Over this? You can't quit!
We've never been so busy!
What the hell's the matter with you?
Harry.
Yeah.
Sorry, thought you were someone else.
It was huge.
It was bigger than you are!
Twice as big as you. Gigantic!
Biggest thing I ever saw.
Excuse me, when did all this happen?
Do you mind? I'm trying to take a statement.
It was huge. Gigantic.
A monster like an ape with rabies, only bigger than a regular ape with rabies.
Now just calm down and tell me what happened.
Okay. I'm okay.
I brought my poor ten-speed to a complete stop like I always do at stop signs.
When out of nowhere this humungous hairy thing is standing right in front of me! Growling.
With these enormous fangs and these giant hands, and he grabs me.
And he picks me up, bike and all, over his head then he smashes me down on the cement and now he's all over me.
And he's snarling with saliva dripping off his pointed teeth.
So I grab my Mace...
- What? Mace? You idiot!
- Stand back.
I didn't really Mace him.
I was about to be eaten!
Eaten? By a vegetarian?
All right, that's it. Officers!
No, now look...
I have no doubt that you saw him, but what really happened is when you saw him, you were so scared shitless that you crashed your precious ten speed into the stop sign, bumped your head on the curb and probably scared him half to death in the process!
I'm right, aren't I? That's what really happened, isn't it?
Isn't it?
Yes. Yes.
How did you know this?
Did you witness it happen?
What's your name, sir?
My name?
My name is George Hen...
George, George what?
George Hen...
George what?
I'm sorry.
I really have to go.
...the dreaded name of Bigfoot
reverberated through newsrooms...
They are usually restricted to remote areas...
Today's report of the legendary beast attacking...
Other news, there has been yet another sighting of the creature
that some people are now calling the legendary Bigfoot.
As a matter of fact an eyewitness is now claiming to have been attacked
by the legendary beast known as Bigfoot.
He quickly changed his story, however...
Update, Bigfoot right here in the city.
When this mystery man known to us as,
George Hen, appeared on the scene...
I have no doubt that you saw him,
but when you saw him, you were so scared...
knowledge of the Bigfoot's habits, vanished before...
and bumped your head on the curb...
crashed your precious ten-speed into the stop sign,
bumped your head on the curb
and probably scared him half to death in the process!
What's your name, sir?
My name?
My name is George Hen...
George, George what?
George Hen...
My name?
My name is George Hen...
George, George what?
George Hen...
How did you know this?
Did you witness it happen?
What's your name, sir?
My name?
My name is George Hen.
Listening to our reporter talk about it,
you'd think Mr. Hen had a personal...
Did I catch the fact that he actually...
Quite possible.
Anybody who knows the whereabouts of the elusive Mr. Hen
or the hairy visitor, should call this station and report Bigfoot.
What the hell is that?
I said get out of here now!
Harry!
Harry!
I want this quadrant air tight.
Nothing gets out! Nothing!
And no force except in self-defense!
I don't want some prankster in a monkey suit bleeding all over the streets.
We have civilians with weapons.
All units in the vicinity of Broadway and Torrance please respond.
Repeat, we have civilians with weapons.
Hey, you! Halt!
Freeze! Move out!
Drop it!
What, are you crazy? Do you know how much I paid for this gun?
Get this guy. Come on, move it! Move it!
My God! Harry?
Harry, are you hurt?
Where are you?
Harry.
Thank God, you're okay!
Come on down!
Stay right there!
Don't move.
Hang on, Harry.
Follow that garbage truck!
Harry! Harry, come on down.
There. Quick! This way!
We did it!
Nancy.
Honey.
Look who's here.
Harry?
Harry!
Harry.
I knew it was you. I could smell you all the way upstairs.
Wow! Let's celebrate!
Let's take a picture!
I'll get the camera.
Ernie, no! No!
Harry,
I'm human.
I made a mistake and I'm sorry.
Dad, he doesn't understand.
I know something he'll understand.
Ernie, give me a hand.
George?
What are we gonna do about Harry?
First things first.
Do you have a cat?
No!
Good, then it's just a hairball.
Are you completely deaf?
I said, "Get me out of here now.
"Tomorrow is too late!"
Jerome,
Jerome, I know where he is.
What the hell do you think I have been doing for the last 25 years?
Him!
Yes, Sasquatch!
Jerome, this time it is different.
I've got his address.
Crazy?
You let me stay here for one more hour and I'll show you me crazy.
Time's running out.
Jerome, you make something happen... now.
Irene, the phone. I've gotta get the phone. Okay.
I just need someone to talk to.
You know, it hasn't been easy with this pool and everything!
And Herb? He's no help!
His latest theory is that a condor flew over and took a shit in it!
Hello?
Hello?
Hello.
I saw you on television last night,
Mr. Hen, and I think we should talk.
Who is this?
Do the words,
"Vital facts that could prevent a tragic
"and unnecessary end for the big fellow, "
ring a bell?
Nancy, it's Wrightwood. Dr. Wrightwood?
Yes. How are you?
Fine.
Can we get together?
Sure, any time.
Now, this afternoon.
Well.
Come to the house.
How about dinner?
Hello, are you still there?
Sorry, bad connection.
You're up near Index, right?
Just take the I-5 right into town.
We're in the Wallingford section.
George? What are you doing?
You?
I'm Wallace Wrightwood.
Dr. Wrightwood.
May I come in?
Yes, of course you can.
Nancy, this is Dr. Wrightwood.
He's the curator of the Bigfoot
Museum I told you about.
I'm pleased to meet you.
Likewise. Thank you.
These are beautiful.
This is our daughter Sarah.
Hello.
Oh, and this is our son, Ernest.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Ernie, this is Dr. Wrightwood.
Something sure smells... good.
That's dinner.
Roast beef.
Mom, where's the roast?
The roast. I'll get it, hon.
The roast, is resting in a shallow unmarked grave in the back yard.
Oh.
Right. Well, there's plenty of other stuff.
Are you vegetarians?
Sometimes.
It depends on the guest.
As you probably know, your Dad paid me a visit the other day at my museum.
I liked him.
What I'm gonna say now just might save his life.
I don't understand.
When I was younger I used to have a good job working as a lab scientist.
Life was great.
And then something happened on a hunting trip darn-near 50 years ago that let the air out of everything.
I went out for a walk one day in the woods.
I heard a rustle behind me.
Then I smelled something that made my eyes water and my lungs smoke!
By the time I turned around all I saw was a streak of fur.
On the ground there was a footprint.
A big footprint.
So, I was hooked from that moment on.
I started spending all the time I could spare searching for the beast.
Then I spent time I couldn't spare.
That's how I lost my job and my friends.
It's so sad.
Well, I didn't tell it so you could cry in your sprouts, or whatever that is, darling.
I'm telling it so that your father won't make the same mistake.
I appreciate what you're saying, Dr. Wrightwood, but there's a big difference between your story and mine.
Not as big as you think.
Maybe even bigger.
No, no, no. You're kidding yourself.
I remember what you told me when you came into my shop.
Bigfoot can come live with us.
We'll accept the responsibility.
Can you imagine what a Bigfoot would do to your home?
Yeah, well, I can.
You're good people.
I'm gonna say this once.
I'm gonna say it simple and I hope to
God for your sakes you all listen.
There are no abominable snowmen.
There are no Sasquatches.
There are no Bigfeet!
Am I missing something?
Oh, Lord! Lord God!
Dr. Wrightwood, say hello to Harry.
Harry?
Isn't he something?
Oh, yes, he's so smart, too. I mean,
George has taught him how to sit.
To sit?
We haven't quite perfected it yet.
Hungry?
He lives here with you?
Temporarily.
Well?
If I call in a favor, I might be able to get you out sometime tonight.
Sometime tonight?
I need a damn good reason.
For Christ's sake, I'm talking about bagging a Sasquatch!
That'll cut a lot of ice for the judge.
It's just not
Harry's world out there.
It's like we've become an enemy to anything wondrous.
Even the scientific community's gonna poke and prod at him until he hates every man that he sees, including you and me.
The only answer is a safe place where even LaFleur can't find him.
I might know a place, but we'd never be able to find it in the dark.
Then you will help us?
In every way I possibly can.
That's wonderful.
We'll leave first thing in the morning.
I'll wake the kids. Real early.
They'll wanna come.
We'll make a whole day of it.
Our last day with Harry.
He's so odd.
He didn't say good night.
I don't even know when he's coming back.
Now, get some sleep.
And where the hell have you been?
There was nothing I could do!
Don't bullshit!
They weren't letting anybody out until they processed those guns and there were a lot of guns!
You need a bath.
And what? Blow my cover?
Hey, come on!
Come on, give me my things!
Hey, when I'm ready, pal.
When he's ready, pal.
Jerome, do something, eh?
So what's your sign?
Kimchee!
Kimchee! Kimchee!
My name is Kim Lee not Kimchee!
You killed them!
Oh, no!
Where are my precious little babies?
Thank you.
Forgive me, Harry?
I'm gonna show these to Irene.
She loves roses.
Sure would be a dream come true if we could keep him.
Well, you know what they say,
"The best things in life are supposed to be free."
Hold it right there, mister.
What did you do to my roses?
No!
Don't even think about it!
One false move out of you and I'm gonna prune your plant.
And I'm talking nip it in the bud!
My God!
Push.
Hurry up, Dad.
George, you drive.
It's not fair!
He should be mine!
Damn you!
LaFleur!
What?
I think we're being followed by our own car!
Wow!
He stole my car!
Oh, my God, will you look at this traffic?
Damn!
Cops!
Everybody just act normal.
Here he comes!
Look what he's doing to my paint job!
He's almost on us, Dad!
George, could you go a little faster?
All right, Mom!
That sucker's history!
Don't kid yourself. This is the part he's good at.
Yay!
I always miss it.
Hurry.
Up here, George.
Hurry!
You better make this a short goodbye, George.
You've gotta go back where you belong now.
Come on, now.
It's LaFleur!
Harry, you've gotta go!
LaFleur!
Hurry, please, please!
There's no time!
No, don't worry about us!
We'll be all right.
Get out of here!
Can't you see we don't want you anymore?
Why can't you go back where you came from?
Now, leave us alone!
Go.
Go!
Goodbye, my friend.
There's no need to cry.
We'll never see him again, will we?
Sure we will! We can just follow his footprints.
Footprints.
Scatter.
Anything to throw him off!
It's a goddamn herd!
Oh, no!
Harry!
Good God! Harry, no!
Listen to me. You're wrong!
I was like you!
I almost killed him myself!
But it would have been murder!
He's not an animal!
He's our friend!
For God's sake, Jacques, open your eyes!
Are you people out of your minds?
Do you think I'm going to stop now?
I'm going to kill him.
You're not gonna kill him!
You're not gonna hurt him!
I won't let you!
George!
George!
I'll kill you first!
Don't let him kill me!
Don't let him kill me!
Please, don't let him kill me!
Don't let him kill me! Please, don't, don't let him kill me.
I'm...
No, no...
Jacques LaFleur, meet Harry.
Harry Henderson.
Strange feeling, eh, Doc?
What are you talking about?
It's over.
Over?
Why, it's just the beginning.
Jocko, this old ticker hasn't thumped like this for years.
It's like going to heaven with your feet still on the ground.
And we get to share it with one of our oldest friends.
Goodbye, Harry.
We gotta let him go.
Harry...
I never got a chance to thank you.
I don't think you'll ever know how much you've meant to us.
You take care of yourself now, okay?
Okay.
Mon dieu!
They have a language?
Now, Jocko, what for you?
I don't know.
There's always Loch Ness.
What a mess.
Every time I look down there,
it gets worse.
Maybe I ought to stop looking down.
Millions of planets,
and that one has always been a problem.
Why that one? I know why.
People. I had to put people on it.
Maybe I ought to go down there
and look around. I gotta do something.
Let's see.
Please, not now. I'm thinking.
Tracy, don't forget to wear your hat.
Bye, Mom.
-Mom, who wears hats?
-Young ladies do.
-Besides, hats are coming back.
-Mother.
Who knows where he's gonna take you?
He's my father, and you know where he's taking me.
To a movie and a Chinese restaurant.
He always does.
You look terrific.
In fact, you look fantastic.
Have a good time.
-Hi, Shingo.
-Think fast.
-Wanna play?
-I can't. I'm going with my father.
I like to go to the movies and eat Chinese food.
I wish my parents would split... but Japanese parents would never split.
-Why not?
-They just don't.
Pretty good for a girl.
-Wanna try again?
-Don't press your luck.
-How's my baby?
-Okay.
-You look nice.
-Thank you.
Can you get the door?
So, how's school?
-Fine.
-Fine.
Listen, you can go all out today: get a double order of egg rolls, extra fortune cookie, whatever you want.
-Yeah?
-Yeah, I got a new spaghetti account.
Wanna hear the slogan I came up with?
You ready?
"The taste of Mama."
That's it?
Come on, that's only the slogan.
Now imagine it.
There's a big pot of really rich tomato sauce bubbling.
All of a sudden, out of it... come two really delicious-looking strands of spaghetti, right? Then....
They break into this wild dance to a disco beat.
Dancing spaghetti?
-Mr. Tenesto likes it.
-Then I like it, too.
Look, you're not even gonna ask what I brought you?
Thanks.
That's it? "Thanks"?
You're not gonna open it?
You open it and a big snake jumps out, right?
Right.
Daddy, you and your tricks.
You're always trying to pull something on me.
So, what do you think, baby?
What do you wanna see?
-Attack From The Hidden Planet.
-No, Tracy. Not another one of those.
-It's supposed to be terrific.
-Yeah, some terrific.
You said that about the one last week.
What a thriller that was.
In one second, a plant turns into a person?
Come on, Tracy.
-But they explained it.
-Yeah?
It was because they came from another planet.
-I mean, their spirits did.
-I didn't see any spirits. What spirits?
Daddy, you can't see spirits.
Tracy, just once, can't we go see a normal movie... with Laurence Olivier or Walter Matthau?
Benji. I'll even go see a movie about a cute dog.
Just because you can't see spirits doesn't mean they're not there.
It's kind of like believing in God.
Sometimes you just have to believe in things you can't see.
-I gotta call Joan. I'll be right back.
-You still going with her?
-Yeah.
-She isn't as pretty as Mom.
She has other qualities I find attractive.
-Her big boobs?
-Give me a break, will you?
Mom says she has big boobs.
I wonder what kind of boobs I'll have.
I'll be right back.
-I'll have the butterfly shrimp.
-That's good.
That's a party of three at 7:00.
Okay, Mr. Jones.
Come in, Tracy.
It's all right. Come in.
Tracy, I'd like to talk to you.
But where are you? I can't see you.
-But you can hear me, Tracy.
-Dad?
I've been called "Our Father," but never "Dad."
Come on, Dad.
Another one of your trick voices?
You can't fool me. Where are you?
Tracy, I'm God.
Yours truly from the fortune cookie.
Okay, so you're God.
What can I do for you?
Tracy, I really am God. I'm not your father.
I'd like to get to know you a little better.
That would be nice, but first make up with Mom.
So why don't we meet in front of the store on Monday?
Yeah, that would be great.
Tracy, if I'm your father, those girls would hear me talking, right?
-Did you just hear that man's voice?
-What voice, honey? Where?
-Tracy, they can't hear me.
-There it goes again. Did you hear it?
No.
But if you were God, why would you bother with me?
It was something you said that sort of interested me.
That sometimes you just have to believe in things you can't see.
-Wow, how'd you know I said that?
-I know, I see, I hear.
This place is too busy. I'll see you later.
Wait, don't go yet!
Where later? How?
-Hi, Mrs. Manley.
-Who were you talking to?
I don't know. I'm not sure.
Are you still there?
He's gone.
-You okay?
-Yeah.
You've been awful quiet since we left the restaurant.
-I'm fine. I've just been thinking.
-Thinking? About what?
Have you ever felt like you might be dreaming... even though you knew you were awake?
Would you like to run that by me again?
Like something happened to you, but it's more like a dream than real.
Daydreaming. Yeah, sure.
It happens to everybody.
It's okay.
I gotta stop by the office for a minute to pick up something.
-Would you wait for me in the car?
-Okay.
All right?
-Tracy, it's me again.
-What?
That wasn't a dream you had. It was real.
-Where are you?
-In the back seat.
Well, disappointed?
Gosh, no, God, sir.
Why would I be disappointed, sir?
-Are you really God, sir?
-Forget the "sir." Just plain God.
The owner of the store.
Also known as The Man Upstairs.
I don't know, but somehow
I thought you'd look holier.
And more fancy, sort of.
I mean, like with a crown, a long beard... and a flowing white robe.
You're thinking of Charlton Heston.
I can't get over it. It's just that...
I guess I expected you to look much older.
Thanks, Tracy. I take care of myself.
-How old are you?
-Who knows?
After the first two million years,
I stopped counting.
It's awkward talking like this.
Wow! How'd you do that?
If I could part the Red Sea,
I can certainly move to the front of a car.
You know, Tracy... it's refreshing talking to a young lady like you.
Takes my mind off some of my problems.
-You have problems?
-Yeah. I'm not always on cloud nine.
They're still not getting my message.
I'm just not in people's thoughts.
They don't believe in me as much as they should these days.
I sure do, and I'm not saying that just because you're here.
I know that, Tracy.
But there are people who think of me only a couple of times a year.
There are others who don't think of me at all until that very last minute.
And then, boy, do I hear from them.
People have to be reminded that I'm still around.
Then why don't you come up with one of your big miracles?
I bet that would really shake them up.
People remember the miracle and forget why I did it.
I've got it. My dad's in that business.
You should advertise: television, radio, billboards, newspapers.
Get a slogan.
A slogan?
Tracy, I'm not a tube of toothpaste.
Slogans really work.
You'll become a household word.
Household word?
Yeah, that would be nice for a change.
All right, Tracy. You've got yourself a job.
You think of a slogan.
I'll think of a way to spread it around.
I'll ask my dad.
He'll come up with a great one.
No. I haven't been doing too well with grown-ups lately.
-I'd rather it came from you.
-Me?
I'm the world's worst writer and my spelling is the pits.
I don't take off for spelling.
If it comes from you, it'll be something that your friends can understand.
That way, I'll have the children on my side.
And when they grow up,
I'll have their children.
Once you've got the children, that's the ball game.
Then I'll be able to take care of a few things... like all that pollution that you've got down here.
And have you noticed you're running out of eagles?
And there are a few volcanoes that need cooling off.
What do you say, Tracy?
Will you come up with a slogan?
-Okay. I'll sure try.
-Good.
I can't believe this is happening to me.
Nobody else will, either.
You're the only one who can see or hear me.
If you tell them about our little visits, they'll think you are....
-Bonkers?
-Definitely.
They gave some of my best people a pretty bad time.
Here comes your father.
Here you go. Sorry I took so long.
-Okay. Ready for your movie?
-Yep.
Three laser fights, a collision of planets, you don't even watch.
Halfway through the movie, you wanna go home. You okay?
-Sorry, Daddy.
-You don't have to be sorry.
Daddy, let's say you have a big new client... and you need a real super slogan.
Where do you start?
First you examine the product.
You try to pick out the single most important thing about it... the thing that's really gonna make it sell.
Like, take potato chips for example.
No, something bigger. More important.
It doesn't really matter.
A product's a product.
The principle is the same.
-Let's say you're selling a person.
-Okay.
A very important person, like... let's say God.
God?
I don't think I'd handle that account.
You make a mistake, and you got a lot of trouble there.
Don't try and get out of it, Daddy.
How would you sell God?
Okay. God.
First, I'd make a list of his good qualities.
His most salable features.
Then I'd come up with a nice low-key slogan.
Then I'd set up lunch with him at the Polo Lounge and pitch it to him.
And then?
If he likes it, I'll pick up the tab.
If he doesn't, I'll let him pick it up.
What is all this stuff about God?
Is it some kind of school project, or....
-Sort of. It's an assignment I just got.
-I see.
Before I drop you off,
I wanna pick up Joan.
-Is that okay?
-Okay.
There she is.
-Yep, there they are.
-Would you stop talking about her--
-Big boobs?
-Come on.
-Would you rather I call them "knockers"?
-Could we just drop them.... Drop it.
-Hi. How are you?
-You tell me.
-Hi, Stacy.
-Tracy.
Of course. What's that?
It's a present my dad got me. Open it.
Cute. Thank you.
-Hi, Mom.
-Hi. How was the movie?
Dumb.
-How was the egg roll?
-Good.
-And his girlfriend?
-Big.
She called me Stacy again.
Your father's not exactly interested in her brain.
Mom?
-Something's on my mind--
-How can he think she's only 28?
-That man is so gullible.
-Mom, I'd like to ask you--
-Did he mention where he was taking her?
-Mom.
What was she wearing?
Mom, she's yucky. She's way over 28 and you're 10 times prettier.
You are a brilliant child.
We know that God has a lot of wonderful qualities... but what would you say are some of his strongest points?
Tracy, what are you talking about?
God.
We'll talk about it later.
That's the Gelmans.
I'm showing them a house.
They're taking me out to dinner.
Go to bed when Rosa tells you to.
Don't give her any trouble, okay?
Can I stay up a little late?
No school tomorrow.
All right.
Don't watch any horror films, okay?
Hide, he'll see you.
Rosa, you're missing the best part.
I like it better this way.
Do you believe in God?
Of course I do.
-Do you ever see him?
-No, but I talk to him.
You talk to God?
-All the time.
-Did you talk to him today?
-You did?
-This morning when I prayed.
-And did God talk to you?
-No, he never talks to me.
Maybe he doesn't understand Spanish so good.
Yes?
What would you say if I told you... that I saw God today and we talked to each other?
You better go to bed.
You're getting loca from these crazy movies.
-You saw God in your dad's car?
-That's right.
And you talked to him in a Chinese restaurant?
Right.
-Did you get his autograph?
-You're putting me on.
-No, you're putting me on.
-Shingo, I really did see God.
Okay. What did God say?
He said if he could get us kids to help him to spread his message... then there would be time for him to do other things.
Like cool off a volcano and stuff.
You two had some rap session.
He wanted me to come up with a slogan for him.
Slogan?
-Like they have in TV commercials.
-What else did he say?
He said spelling didn't count.
I don't believe a word of what you're saying.
Spelling always counts.
Why do I waste time talking to you?
Maybe she did see God.
Harold.
Can you give me a set containing... five prime numbers?
Two, three, five, seven, and eleven.
That's very good, Harold.
Miss Hudson.
Lisa.
Can you tell me the properties of a set?
It's a series of whole numbers.
-That's right. Thank you.
-Miss Hudson.
-I know--
-Tracy.
Can you tell me the properties of a subset?
I'd like to see you after class is over.
You've been very inattentive in class... and you haven't turned in your homework all week.
I'm sorry, Miss Hudson.
Is there anything the matter at home, something I should know?
You sure?
What have you been doing with your time?
I just can't explain it.
I'm gonna send a note home to your parents.
Maybe you can explain it to them.
Girls, I bought a lot of underwear
for my men...
and every year I pick Fruit of the Loom.
-Surprise, Emma!
-Hiya, cuties.
I say every man ought to buy
Fruit of the Loom briefs.
...but they don't.
So I carry the American Express Card.
I ordered steak.
-I don't want a movie.
-But I wanted steak.
I don't think he wants the movie.
At PSA, we never lost sight
of what an airline should be.
So at PSA we give you more planes
and less fancies.
We give you low fares, not fanfares.
-You still watching television?
-Yeah, it's Friday night.
You should be in bed.
It's almost 11:30.
I wanna see some of the Johnny Carson show.
-All right. Would you like some cocoa?
-Yeah, great.
But after cocoa, you go to bed.
From Hollywood, The Tonight Show
starring Johnny Carson...
This is Ed McMahon
along with Tommy Newsome...
and the NBC orchestra...
inviting you to join Johnny and his guests:
Bob Hope, Angie Dickinson,
Melissa Manchester...
and Olympics expert Bud Greenspan.
And now, ladies and gentlemen...
here's Johnny!
God? On the Johnny Carson show?
Why not? He gets everybody else to replace him.
I can't believe it.
Don't worry, Tracy. Only you can see me.
Everybody else is watching Johnny Carson.
You really get around.
When you got a territory as big as mine, you can't dog it.
-Have you got a slogan for me?
-Yeah, I got a few.
-Good. Let's hear them.
-Okay, here we go.
"How do you spell relief? G-O-D."
That's nice. It's real nice.
But I don't think it's for me.
How about this:
"God is bullish on humanity."
That's nice, too. You got any more?
Sure. This one's my favorite:
"You're in good hands with God."
That's good.
But then again, Tracy, that's always been good.
I thought you'd go for that one.
-How about, "Let God put you--"
-"In the driver's seat"?
Look, I worked hard on these.
I'm sure you did.
But, Tracy, I don't want you to think
I'm bragging... but let's face it:
I'm an original, the one and only.
I made my own mold and threw it away.
You know, this isn't exactly easy.
I didn't say it would be.
I'll give you another week.
-Just a week?
-That's long enough.
Look at what I accomplished in a week.
And I did it without computers.
Yeah, but you didn't have a math test coming up.
One week.
I say if you don't set deadlines, nothing happens.
Can I ask my dad for help?
In math, sure.
What about Shingo? Can he help me?
Your little friend? Yeah, Shingo can help.
We'll do the best we can for you.
We'll really try.
But a week? I don't see why you have to have it so fast.
-Who are you talking to?
-Nothing. Nobody.
You were just talking to someone.
That? I was talking back to the television.
-The set isn't even on.
-I turned it off.
It was some dumb commercial.
They're always trying to sell you something.
How about, "You can be sure if it's God"?
No, I told you. It has to be original.
We've been at it for hours. Let's go home.
I'm starved.
-Wait, I think I'm on to something.
-I like it. Let's go.
I didn't say it yet.
How about, "Buy God"? B-U-Y.
Great. Let's go.
No, it's too commercial.
He wouldn't like that.
I guess you know him better than I do.
-How about, "Try God"?
-Great.
-"Good God."
-That's even greater.
-"Great God."
-Perfect!
No, it just misses.
How come everything just misses?
I don't know. It's just a gut feeling.
That's an advertising expression.
I've got a gut feeling, too.
I'm hungry. Let's go home.
We'll think God tomorrow.
-What did you say?
-I said, we'll think God tomorrow.
-That's it!
-What's it?
"Think God." That's a terrific slogan!
Shingo, you saved the day.
"Think God." He'll love it!
I can't believe it.
Who does she think she's talking to?
There's gotta be something wrong with that kid.
You know, this is the second time
I've seen her act like that.
Harriet, look at the way she's carrying on.
-Poor Tracy.
-Poor Paula.
I wouldn't want to be her mother.
"Think God."
"Think God." Very interesting.
It's got a message, it's short, and tells it all.
Tracy, I really like it.
Thank God.
I like that one, too.
But let's go with "Think God."
-Shingo came up with that one.
-I had a hunch he would.
Now that you like the slogan, how are you gonna spread it around?
You've done such a good job so far,
I'm gonna have you do it.
Me? I wouldn't know where to start.
-Why not start with your friends?
-But a whole big advertising campaign?
-How would I do that?
-I'm sure you'll find a way.
I don't think this is fair.
Why don't you pick on somebody who isn't behind in her homework?
Tracy, I've picked on some pretty good people.
You should be happy to be in their company.
Well, okay.
You know, you're not exactly easy to turn down.
So that's what we've gotta do.
We've gotta write "Think God" all over the place.
On walls, on sidewalks... we've gotta make little signs and stick them on trees... car bumpers, telephone poles, everywhere.
We want it all over: "Think God."
-You know what I think?
-What?
I think you're a loony.
If I'm gonna write on walls,
I'm not writing "Think God."
Yeah, I know you, Charlie.
The things you write on walls would fog up your glasses.
Come on, you guys. Let Tracy talk.
Listen. This is a good idea.
We all take God too much for granted.
Why shouldn't we remind people to think about him?
If it wasn't for him, none of us would be here.
That will shake up my mother and father.
I think Tracy's got a neat idea.
Let's do something good for a change.
Let's take a vote.
All in favor, raise your hands.
What is this? What are we, a bunch of religious freaks?
Next thing, you'll have us shaving our heads.
I've heard some dumb ideas,
I've heard some crazy ideas... but I've gotta tell you, this one takes the cake.
And it should take the cake because it's the greatest idea I ever heard.
Let's all get together behind Tracy and put this thing over.
What made me say that?
What do you think you're doing?
Go on. Get out of here!
There. Now that looks better.
Yes?
Tracy, I wanna talk to you.
Can't it wait? I'm awful hungry.
I wanna talk to you right now.
-Got the note from Miss Hudson?
-Sit down.
You don't have to worry about a thing.
I'm gonna catch up on my homework.
-Tracy, sit down.
-When's dinner?
Park it.
Harriet stopped by the office today... and she told me that she saw you talking to yourself at the Red Dragon.
That you were doing the same thing in McDonalds. What's going on?
-I wasn't talking to myself.
-Then who were you talking to?
Was it the same person you were talking to the other night?
-You won't believe me.
-I will.
God.
What's God got to do with it?
He's the one I've been talking to.
God.
You mean you've been praying to God, sort of, out loud?
No, he talks to me and I talk to him.
You mean, you actually heard him?
Sure, I heard him.
He was right there in the den.
You mean you saw him, too?
It's impossible.
You're imagining things, honey.
People just do not see and chat with God.
Mom, I saw him, lots of times.
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
Shingo, that's great... but I can't talk about it.
I'm trying to do my homework.
Homework? Who's doing homework?
We're printing, painting, and posting.
I got my cousins doing it at their school.
-It's spreading all over.
-That's great.
That's just fantastic.
Keep up the good work.
-You can take over for me.
-Tracy, you started it.
I know I started it, but you can finish it for me.
-Goodbye, Shingo.
-Wait. Tracy--
-Hi.
-Tracy, you can't quit.
I just did.
You're off to such a great start.
You're doing a super job for a great cause.
And getting into super trouble.
Welcome to the club.
There're some heavy hitters in that lineup:
Socrates, Martin Luther King...
Mahatma Gandhi, Abe Lincoln.
But I'm just a kid.
I told my mom the whole thing and now she thinks I'm bananas.
-It never fails.
-She's really uptight about it.
"Bananas." I hate that expression.
I make a beautiful fruit, and people use it for "crazy."
My teacher's on my back, too.
I've been so busy doing your stuff,
I haven't done any homework.
Let me see what you got there.
About a zillion problems to make up, that's all.
Let me see. Maybe I can help you.
Mathematics. That was a mistake.
I should have made the whole thing a little easier.
You make mistakes?
Nobody's perfect.
I blew it with the Dead Sea.
All that salt and no life in it.
And the flamingo, beautiful bird... and I put the kneecaps on backwards.
And I could have found a better way for a skunk to defend himself.
And you sure goofed with the giraffe.
-Giraffe?
-Why'd you make the neck so long?
So he could eat the leaves off the trees.
Why didn't you just make the trees shorter?
Where were you when I needed you?
-I don't believe it. This is incredible.
-I know, it's awful.
A couple of weeks ago, she was acting a little strangely.
Yes. She was asking me some questions about God.
How I'd handle an advertising campaign for him.
I didn't think anything about it at the time.
I just don't know how a thing like this happens.
Do you suppose maybe she's making the whole thing up?
-You know, kind of a play for attention--
-Come on, Don.
If there's one thing about Tracy, she's truthful.
I don't think that child ever told a lie in her life.
-I'm sorry I was so crabby before.
-I understand.
Here's your homework.
Wow! Thanks.
God... who do you pray to?
Me? Well, sometimes I talk to myself.
It must be real lonesome up there.
Let me put it this way.
When I sneeze, there's no one around to bless me.
Now it's my dad. I've gotta go.
And bless you, God.
That's for your next sneeze.
Maybe I should have made the trees a little shorter.
-Hi, Daddy.
-Hi, sweetheart.
-How's my baby?
-I'm okay.
-So....
-Mom told you?
Look, sweetheart....
You know, sometimes people imagine things.
-Kids, in particular.
-I didn't imagine it.
The thing is, it seems so real.
It really seems like it happened.
I talked to him. He talked to me.
Your imagination just runs right away from you.
Daddy, I know it's hard to believe.
It's hard for me to believe, but it happened.
It happened?
Let me get this straight.
You're saying you actually saw God?
-I mean, as a real person?
-Lots of times.
-When was the last time you saw him?
-He just helped me with my math.
Oh, my God.
God was upstairs helping you with your homework?
Yeah, here it is.
His multiplication is very good... but, sweetheart, these are your numbers.
-That's your writing.
-That was easy for him to do.
Yeah, I suppose it would be.
Right.
Okay. We'll talk about this later, all right?
Why don't you go back upstairs and finish... your studying, okay?
But you both think I'm bananas.
I shouldn't have said that.
He hates that expression.
What the hell has been going on around here since I left?
What the hell does that mean?
If you spent less time peddling those overpriced houses... this probably wouldn't have happened.
I have never neglected that child, and you know it.
Damn it, I am not the one who moved out. You are.
Let's not get into that right now.
That's not the problem.
Why don't I take her to a child psychiatrist?
No way. Never.
Paula, she needs help.
Look.
You take care of Boobs, and I will take care of Tracy.
We're not here to argue. She's in trouble.
-What about a minister? He could at least--
-Look.
Why do we have to take her to anybody?
I mean, maybe it's not all that bad, you know?
She's ours.
Can't we just work it out ourselves?
Okay, give it a couple of days.
Maybe she'll just snap out of it.
I'll call you.
God helped her with her homework.
Terrific. Just terrific.
What the hell is going on around here?
Everywhere I look, "Think God."
-Who's responsible for this?
-It's Tracy Richards.
Who's Tracy Richards?
What grade is she in?
-She's in Miss Hudson's class.
-Get her in here and Miss Hudson, too.
I'll get to the bottom of this.
What are we running here, a school or a monastery?
Now, Mr. and Mrs. Richards, since this is a behavior problem...
I've asked Dr. Young, our school psychologist, to sit in.
She's a little behind in her homework, but--
It's way beyond that, Mrs. Richards.
Have you seen all those "Think God" signs around?
Tracy is responsible for the whole thing.
She held a meeting and got kids worked up.
Now they're all running around writing, tacking up signs.
What exactly is so awful about writing "Think God"? I mean--
If kids are gonna write things on walls anyhow... they might as well write something nice.
I agree, but the point is... religion in the schools is a very sensitive area. It is not allowed.
She's got the whole place in an uproar.
She's disrupted the entire school.
She's never been a troublemaker.
She's certainly making up for it this time.
I had a talk with her.
I told her to cut all this out.
But she said she couldn't.
She couldn't?
That's why you're here.
Would you bring in Tracy, please?
If you can't get her to cooperate...
I'll simply have to suspend her from school.
I'm sorry.
Tracy, would you sit down, please?
Your parents would like to talk to you.
You really have to cooperate.
I mean, Mr. Benson is right.
You've disrupted the entire school.
Unless this thing stops... they're gonna suspend you.
You don't want that to happen, do you?
Okay, Mom. I guess you're right.
I'll tell the kids to call the whole thing off.
Now, that's all we ask!
All right, Tracy, you can go back to class now.
-Thank you, Mr. Benson. Bye, Mommy.
-Goodbye, sweetheart.
-See you Saturday, Daddy.
-Bye, baby.
But before I tell the kids to stop,
I have to ask him.
Ask who?
Ask who, Tracy?
God.
Oh, God.
He's the one who told you to do this?
Yeah. It was part his idea and part mine.
When you talked to him, did he talk to you, too?
Yes. In fact, he talked to me first.
I see.
We talked quite a few times.
When was the first time?
You mean the first time I talked to him or the first time I saw him?
-You saw him?
-Sure.
What did he look like?
He wears glasses, and he's got gray hair... and he's a very nice-looking man.
I'm sure.
How did you first meet him?
In a Chinese restaurant.
He sent me a message in a fortune cookie.
Tracy, would you wait out in the hall, please?
Your child needs help.
She is out of touch with reality.
-Now, wait a minute.
-I have my responsibility.
I'm sorry to tell you this,
Mr. and Mrs. Richards... but as of now,
Tracy is suspended from school.
-For how long?
-Until she's well.
How do you like that, suspending Tracy?
-It's not fair.
-She didn't do anything wrong.
If they're throwing her out, why don't they throw us out?
-We've all been writing "Think God."
-What are we gonna do?
We're not gonna take it lying down.
We'll fight back. Come on.
And another thing, everybody is trying to help me.
I don't need any help. I feel fine.
I'm perfectly normal.
In fact, you ought to be proud of me.
Not everybody gets picked by God.
I'm in a pretty good club, too:
Socrates, Abe Lincoln, and people like that.
Mr. and Mrs. Richards, the doctor would like to see you first.
We'll be back in a minute, baby.
Hiya, Tracy.
Hello. I was wondering when you were gonna show up.
Expelled from school, and now you're a little upset about this?
No, I'm fine.
I thought you might be a little upset.
I know you've got a lot of things to do... but you wouldn't get so busy that you'd forget about me, would you?
-You are a little worried, aren't you?
-I guess I am.
Let me tell you a little story.
There was this tiger in the jungle, and he got a thorn in his paw.
It was very painful.
There was a little cat there who saw this.
She pulled the thorn out of the tiger's paw.
This made the tiger very happy.
The little cat says, "Now that I've done you a favor, you can do me a favor."
The tiger says, "Anything."
The cat says, "Whenever I'm in the jungle,
I'm scared of all the other animals."
The tiger says, "No problem.
"When you walk through the jungle, just hold your head up.
"Shake your head, wag your tail, and they'll all think you're a tiger."
The little cat tried it, and got away with it for three years.
Until one day she ran into the same tiger.
There she was, shaking her head, wagging her tail.
The tiger says, "Kid, you don't have to shake your head and wag your tail at me.
"I know you're a cat."
-That's it?
-That's it.
What's that have to do with me?
Nothing, but it's such a cute story
I thought it might cheer you up.
That's better.
You've been separated for seven months, right?
-Yes.
-I see.
From what you've told me,
Tracy's contacts with God... usually take place in eating areas: the Chinese restaurant,
McDonald's, an ice cream cart.
And they have all taken place since you, Mr. Richards... left the house following your separation.
So obviously...
Tracy has created a fantasy father figure as a substitute... to give her the emotional nurturing she craves from her missing father.
-Are you sure?
-One is never completely sure... but there is something else you said that's very intriguing.
Tracy's fantasy father, God... like her real father, is interested in advertising... or spreading a message, so to speak.
That's true.
These are only theories.
I'll have to give Tracy a series of tests in order to verify them.
Bring back Tracy!
What's your first memory involving a person?
I can remember my dad peeling an apple.
Now today, I want you to tell me... if these are real people or imaginary characters.
Robert Redford. He's real.
George Washington.
-Was he real?
-Of course.
Bugs Bunny.
Real or imaginary?
Come on, Doctor.
Would you mind looking at these slides and tell me what you see?
Egg foo yung.
Okay, what about this?
Shrimp in lobster sauce.
And this?
Spaghetti. "The taste of Mama."
You seem to associate everything with food.
That seems very significant.
It could also be I'm starved.
There is no evidence of any organic disturbance in Tracy.
That's good.
However, the evaluation in the behavioral area... is not encouraging.
Tracy is still steadfastly insisting... that she's actually seen and spoken with God... a delusion that indicates a real psychosis.
-Psychosis?
-I'm afraid so.
What Tracy needs is observation and treatment.
Now, we have a fine place in Santa Barbara... where she'll get expert care and before--
Wait a minute.
You're not actually suggesting... that she be put in an institution, are you?
Mr. Richards, don't let that word bother you.
A bank is an institution.
A school, a supermarket, everything is an institution.
The fact of the matter is, this is a nice, pleasant... controlled environment with a trained staff.
She'll be much better off there.
And she has to be there.
It's a kind of ranch up in Santa Barbara, sweetheart... only you won't have to go for at least a couple of days.
And you'll be back before you know it.
Don't be so uptight. I'm not worried at all.
That's a good attitude, honey.
You're a very bright young lady.
God would never let them put me into an institution.
I'm starved. Let's go for lunch.
Bring back Tracy!
God?
Where are you? I need you. It's been days.
Tomorrow they're putting me into an institution.
I've been to three churches and a synagogue.
I've been looking all over for you.
From Hollywood, The Tonight Show
starring Johnny Carson.
This is Ed McMahon
along with Doc Severinsen...
and the NBC orchestra...
inviting you to join Johnny and his guests:
Buddy Hackett, Steve Lawrence,
and Dizzy Gillespie.
And now, ladies and gentlemen...
here's Johnny!
Tracy, what's wrong?
I came to say goodbye. I'm running away.
They're not gonna lock me up.
-Where are you going?
-I don't know. Someplace.
I'll be right down. Meet me in my garage.
I know the perfect place for you to hide.
"Dear Mom and Dad,
I'm not going to any funny farm.
"Don't worry, I'll be okay. I love you both.
"Remember to feed my goldfish."
Paula, it's all right. We'll find her.
-Rosa, are you okay?
-Fine.
-Is there any coffee in the kitchen?
-Yes, of course.
Would you bring some? Come on.
Don, that poor little kid.
What could've happened to her?
-Where could she be?
-It'll be all right.
First thing I think we should do is call the police.
It'll be all over the papers.
It already is.
Shingo, where have you been?
I've been looking all over town for you.
I've been out tacking up signs.
-Where's Tracy?
-Why? Is she missing?
-Shingo, where's Tracy?
-I don't know. I haven't seen her all day.
Look, pal. You and Tracy are very close.
She tells you everything.
Now you listen to me, this is very serious.
I wanna know where she is.
-Shingo talk you.
-Thank you.
Hi, Shingo. What's up?
-I had to tell your father where you are.
-Why?
He dragged it out of me.
They're on their way to pick you up.
Thanks, Shingo.
This is the last call
for the Southwest Limited...
Amtrak Train Number 4...
departing for Chicago on Track 3.
All aboard!
Where have you been?
I've looked all over for you.
Tracy, I'm a very busy man.
My phone never stops ringing.
Running away? That's not like you.
I was scared. I didn't wanna go into that dumb institution.
-It all seemed so hopeless.
-So you panicked.
All I was doing was causing trouble.
-My parents were so worried about me.
-Now they're even more worried.
-I guess running away isn't the answer.
-Never was.
When you know you're right, you hang in there.
I suppose I'm not a member of the club anymore.
No. The best of them had their weak moments.
They all struck out a few times.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Tracy, I'm taking you home.
I want you to.
-You feel better now?
-Yeah.
-Can I ask you a question?
-Go ahead.
Why do you let bad things happen?
You ask very good questions.
You know, things that you might think are bad are not always bad.
Sometimes there's a purpose you're not aware of.
But what about sickness?
What about kids my age who get sick and die?
-Those are really bad things, aren't they?
-Those are bad things.
Yes, pain and suffering.
That's a hard one to explain.
I'll bet.
I know this sounds like a cop-out... but there's nothing I can really do about pain and suffering.
It's built into the system.
-Which you invented.
-Right.
My problem was I never could figure out how to make anything...
-with just one side to it.
-One side?
-You ever see a front without a back?
-No.
-A top without a bottom?
-No.
-An up without a down?
-No.
Okay. And there can't be good without bad... life without death, pleasure without pain.
That's how it is. If I take sad away, happy has to go with it.
If anyone knows another way,
I wish they'd put it in the suggestion box.
I guess someday I'll understand.
If you do, you'll be the first.
Some things can't be grasped.
What's the end? The end of time?
The end of the universe?
Even Einstein flunked that one.
You talk to me like I'm grown up.
I like that.
Good. Let's get going.
In a half hour, you'll be in your own bed.
A half hour? But you got to my room from the Carson show in one second.
Tracy, that works for me.
For you, I'll have to do it the hard way.
And there it is.
-Wow! I'm going to like this.
-Come on, let's go.
-Have you ever been on one of these?
-No.
Neither have I. Hang on.
Having fun, Tracy?
This is terrific!
Here come the police!
Hold on!
Did you see what I saw?
-No driver, just a passenger?
-That's right.
-No report on this one.
-No way.
We must have just missed her.
Paula, it's all right.
The police are gonna find her.
Look, why don't I stay over in case we hear something?
There's a light in Tracy's room.
Where were you, darling? What happened?
Baby, are you all right?
-How did you get home?
-God brought me home on his motorcycle.
That's just wonderful, sweetheart.
-Come on, get some sleep now.
-Okay.
-Good night, button.
-Good night.
Don't worry. I'm not afraid of that institution anymore.
We'll talk about it in the morning, Tracy.
Good night.
Good morning. I'm Hugh Downs.
I've been broadcasting now for a little over four decades... and I have never seen a phenomenon like the one that's going on today.
Fourteen days ago... a little schoolgirl from West Los Angeles,
California, Tracy Richards... decided to write "Think God" on this sidewalk.
She got some school friends to help her.
And this thing has really spread.
On fences, on bumper stickers.
And look at this.
And this.
And if you think that's something, there is more.
London.
From Buckingham Palace
to Piccadilly Square...
everywhere Londoners go today...
they are reminded by signs to think God.
Paris.
Tokyo.
Cairo.
Now here is noted psychologist,
Dr. Joyce Brothers.
I think we should keep an open mind.
If there isn't a God, I'd like to point out...
that those children
who would easily engage in fantasy...
who've had an imaginary playmate
or an imaginary companion...
actually do better in dealing with
the crises of life than those who didn't.
And if there is a God...
I believe that Tracy Richards saw him
and actually spoke to him.
Strangely, children often have
a firmer grip on reality than most adults.
And as the Old Testament says:
"And a little child shall lead them. "
Now we know the reason.
The churches are full, but the classrooms are empty.
Yes, when Tracy Richards was expelled from school... it set off a citywide student strike.
It also set off bitter confrontation... between Superintendent of Schools,
Jeffrey Hodges... and psychiatrist Dr. Jerome Newell, in whose care Tracy has been placed.
The Superintendent wants her back in school... but Dr. Newell says no.
The case is being heard by Judge Thomas Miller today.
Your Honor, we're in a crisis.
As Superintendent of Schools, it's my responsibility... to get the children back into class.
I want a court order to force Dr. Newell to release Tracy Richards from his care.
Superintendent Hodges is wrong,
Your Honor.
The girl does not belong in school.
She's suffering from delusions.
She belongs in a place where she can get care and treatment.
Children imagine lots of things.
Our whole school system is paralyzed... because of the personal opinion of one man.
Excuse me, but I don't intend... to rely on the personal opinion of one man, sir.
Now, before I issue a court order,
Dr. Newell...
I'd like you to do something for me.
I'd like you to convene a panel... of top psychiatrists in this city... and have them thoroughly examine this poor little girl, Tracy Richards, is it?
And then, when they've made their conclusions...
I'll make my decision.
Yes, I met him in my dad's car, he came through the television set... he gave me an ice cream cone,
Cherry Jubilee... we had lunch at McDonald's, and I'll say it again... he brought me home on his motorcycle.
Dr. Whitley, there's one question
I would like to ask--
I think there have been enough questions.
Mr. and Mrs. Richards, is there anything that you'd like to add?
-What can we say?
-No.
We'd like to do whatever's best for Tracy.
Would the three of you mind stepping into the waiting room, please? Carl.
It's very evident what we're dealing with here.
I might add, Dr. Newell, you've done your usual thorough job.
-Thank you.
-May I bring up a point?
Before we vote, I'd like to remind you... that there's a great deal of sympathy for that little girl... and many children are out of school.
Our profession will be under tremendous pressure.
-We can't give in to that.
-No, we can't give in to that.
No, we can't. If we let her run around with her delusions... what do we do about the patient who thinks he's Napoleon?
Certainly. If she's right... then we're all wrong.
No, the girl belongs in an institution.
Are there any objections?
No? Then that's settled.
Carl, would you bring them back in, please?
They're ready.
We've all decided that you need help... and believe me, it's in your best interest.
And the chances are that you won't be there for long.
If you look at it in a positive way,
I'm sure that--
It's him. It's God.
Sorry I'm late.
I want to apologize to my distinguished colleagues.
I would've been here sooner, but I was stuck in traffic.
Excuse me, sir. Who are you?
-Dr. Stevens.
-I don't recall your being invited.
If I waited to be invited,
I'd miss a lot of important things.
However, in this case,
I think you're mistaken.
But your name's not on the list....
Yes, it is.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're all learned psychiatrists.
What did this little girl do that was so terrible?
She got a lot of children together.
They all wrote "Think God"... and the whole world is thinking God.
Is that so bad?
But, sir, as a learned psychiatrist... you ought to know that that's not the point.
This little girl claims that not only did she see God and speak to him... but he spoke to her, as well.
Who are we in this room to say that she didn't?
Maybe she did.
Maybe she didn't.
Look, sir, we've all voted.
I know that, Dr. Whitley, and you said if she's right then we're all wrong.
How did you know I said that?
I also read tea leaves.
Look, what is all this?
We are competent professionals.
We know our business.
We've been over this case backwards and forwards... and we have made our decision.
I wouldn't want this to get around, but if we're all so competent... so right in all our methods and theories... how is it there are so many people still in institutions who never get out?
But that's a situation that is beyond our control.
There are many people who'll never be able to distinguish... between reality and illusion.
But we have to remember sometimes it's very difficult... to determine what is reality and what is illusion.
For instance, the chandelier.
Now, that's reality.
We all looked up, we all saw it.
We all know it's there.
But is it?
I can't believe it.
Oh, my God. It is God.
What's the illusion and what's the reality?
Did the chandelier disappear or not?
We're all intelligent people.
Did we see it, or didn't we see it?
Maybe that little girl did see and talk with God.
Where is it written that Moses had an exclusive?
Just because we haven't spoken to God doesn't mean that she hasn't.
I don't know what's going on here!
I don't know who you are.
Maybe you're a magician or a hypnotist... but there are some things that
I am sure of.
I know that we're all psychiatrists here.
I know I'm Benjamin Charles Whitley.
I know I have four children.
I know I pay $2,200 a month alimony.
I know this is the UCLA Medical Center... and I know that it is now precisely 11:30 in the morning.
Doctor, are you sure it's morning?
Doctor, you're right.
It is 11:30 in the morning.
I know we're all anxious to get home, but before we judge Tracy... shouldn't we all be a little more sure of ourselves?
If we told everybody that we saw day turn into night and night into day... they'd throw us out of school, too.
So maybe Tracy did see God.
Maybe you're seeing him right now.
Maybe you're not.
Think about it. Give it some thought.
If you'll excuse us, we're gonna take Tracy home now.
We've gotta get her ready for school in the morning.
Come on, baby.
I don't know whether any of us here... understand what really happened here... but I'm inclined to think... that it might be a very good idea... if we keep it to ourselves.
Very well, then.
The case of Tracy Richards is closed.
-Thank God.
-You're welcome.
To the three of us.
How about a little kiss?
Thank you.
-How about one over here?
-With pleasure.
Reconciliations are more fun than weddings.
Excuse me. I'll be right back.
-Where are you going?
-Just going to the lounge for a second.
Don't be too long, Tracy.
Your egg foo yung will get cold.
Come in, Tracy.
I was waiting for the door to open by itself.
Sorry. I forgot.
You see, Tracy, everything worked out.
It sure did.
It's real neat the way you got my parents back together again.
No. They did that by themselves.
Come on, I bet you arranged the whole thing.
Honest to me, I didn't.
Tracy, the reason I called you...
I want to thank you and all the children for the wonderful job you did.
Will I ever see you again?
If I ever have a real big problem... you'll be the first one I'll call.
You won't need me. You're God.
You don't need anybody.
God needs everyone.
I need all the help I can get.
Goodbye, Tracy.
Go ahead, Tracy.
There's nothing worse than cold egg foo yung.
English
The fish are dead!
The truck. Please, Mr. Huberty.
Quickly, come on.
What do you know about Baal-Dahar?
Baal-Da-what?
I was in Jerusalem for a symposium.
Why am I here?
Baal-Dahar's an Arab village.
It's rumoured to be a terrorist base.
I should say "was."
This morning we found it destroyed.
What does that have to do with me?
It's how it was destroyed.
That's where we need your help.
My help? I know nothing about terrorists.
I think you've made a terrible mistake.
Please, come with me.
You don't understand. I'm the wrong man.
I can't help you. I'm a meteorologist!
We know.
That's why we brought you here.
You see that...
...was Baal-Dahar.
Yesterday, a kibbutz nearby was attacked.
They threw a petrol bomb into the school.
Thirty-four children burned to death.
We tracked the terrorists back to here and found this.
It's incredible.
- Can you explain it?
- It cannot be explained.
- I have clearance.
- You damn well better.
The Vatican.
I'm sorry...
...Father Lucci.
Can you explain it?
With the proper equipment, I think...
I don't think so.
They'll never explain it.
It'll melt in a day or a week and they'll forget it.
They'll call it a freak, an aberration.
You don't think it is.
I would, Colonel, except this kind of thing happened here once before.
Baal-Dahar has been here for 3,000 years.
But you see, Baal-Dahar was built on the ruins of an older place.
A much older place.
And it too was destroyed.
But you wouldn't want that to explain this.
Why is that?
Because that place that was destroyed was called Sodom.
Destroyed by the wrath of God.
How's he doing?
I have to tell you, he's still a boy.
- Is he kicking a lot?
- He's very active. Moves all over the place.
That's great. We're getting some good soccer in our last trimester.
I can't wait. Two months to go.
I want to see you next week.
I'm not completely happy with his growth.
And your amniotic fluid is a little less than normal.
But you said he's doing fine.
He is. There's nothing to be alarmed about.
But I can't say definitely that we won't run into the same problem again.
I know this time it'll be okay.
I've been eating really well and resting.
That's good.
So I'll see you both next week.
"... have seen the glory
Of the coming of the Lord
"He has trampled out the vintage
Where the grapes of wrath are stored
"He has loosed his fateful lightning
Of his terrible swift sword
"His truth is marching on"
They're so adorable.
Would you like to see the computer room now?
At the Oaks we start them early.
So your husband is a lawyer...
...and you restore fine arts for the Hirshenson Collection.
- And the baby's due...
- February 29th.
- It's leap year.
- Of course.
I notice you didn't write anything under
"Religious Denomination."
Do you mind if I ask why?
Because I don't have any.
Is that a problem?
No, no. I just don't like blanks.
Hi, baby dog.
Ace, be careful. Good boy.
Hello?
Well, let's see.
It's $650, utilities included.
It's a garage apartment.
No, no problems with the fumes.
We park our car outside.
It's partially furnished. There's a bed and a table right now, but that's about it.
I see. Well, okay. Sorry.
Hi, sweetness.
Tragedy continues to strike
around the globe...
.... As the changing
weather patterns continue.
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.
- That's nice.
- Thanks.
How did it go today?
The State Supreme Court denied my appeal.
- Are you kidding?
- I couldn't believe it.
- I thought you had such a strong appeal.
- So did I.
So did I.
The whole petition was based on the fact that Jimmy's trial lawyer was incompetent.
I've told you that. I thought I proved it.
Shit. What are you going to do?
Appeal again. Fight it.
Anyway, how's our bouncing baby boy?
Good. We had a good day.
Good.
I know we talked about it and decided not to...
...but I went to the Oaks today and put down a deposit.
It only puts us on the waiting list for four years.
Why are you doing this?
I just want to be prepared.
I want you to be realistic.
- I am realistic.
- We don't know for sure if the baby...
I saw Dr. Inness today.
She said I'm doing perfect. No problems.
Really?
This baby is going to be fine.
It has to be.
It has to be? What if it isn't? Then what?
I just don't want to lose you, that's all.
Okay?
Okay.
Will you die for Him?
Will you die for Him?
What is it?
What's the matter?
I was in these rooms.
Oh, God, I could feel it coming.
Death.
It was just a dream, Abby.
It was just a dream.
It's all right.
It was just a dream.
Russell Quinn?
Penny Washburn. Sorry I'm late.
I understand you're quite an expert on death sentence appeals.
So they say.
What do you know about this case?
So far, not much.
The kid murdered his parents?
He poured gasoline on them and set them on fire while they were sleeping.
I take it this is not someone with a lot of remorse.
His parents were brother and sister.
"Executed for the word of God" is what he said in his signed confession.
Jimmy...
- How's it going?
- Hello, Russell.
This is Penny Washburn.
She's going to help us with your case.
- Hello, Penny.
- Hello.
- Can we talk a minute?
- Yes.
Penny's going to help me prepare a new appeal...
...but we'll need your help.
I told you, I do not go to hospital.
I can't help you unless you let me.
Just talk to her, tell her what happened, that's all.
No hospital.
Jimmy, this is important.
If you go to the hospital, the doctors may find you incompetent.
Then the court will reconsider your case.
Otherwise, we don't have anything.
I know what is right and I know what is wrong.
I did nothing wrong.
You admitted killing your parents.
It was not wrong. It was the law of God.
Leviticus.
Isn't murder a crime too, in the eyes of God?
It is not murder to punish the guilty.
Incest may be against the law of God...
...but it's the law of California that we're dealing with.
They've sentenced you to the gas chamber!
Do you want to die?
No.
Then go to the hospital and let the doctors see if you knew what you were doing.
That says I did a crime!
That it was wrong!
If it'll save your life, say you're wrong!
What is it going to matter?
It matters to God!
No hospital.
Goodbye, Penny.
Jimmy, think about it. Please.
- Hello.
- Hi.
My name is David.
David Bannen.
I'm here about the apartment.
Please, come in.
Ace, get down! He usually doesn't do this. Go on, get down.
It's okay. Hi, Ace.
Get down!
I'm surprised. He never does this.
I'll go get the keys.
Would you like a towel? You're soaked.
It's terrible out there, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
If I can just find these keys.
Where are you from?
All over. I've moved around a lot.
- Because of work?
- Yes.
What do you do?
I'm a teacher. Ancient languages.
Over at the university?
I've been travelling for some time.
I've really just come back to town.
May I have some water?
Sure. Let me get you a glass.
- Use the bottled water, it's better.
- Thanks.
Your baby is due in February.
The 29th.
How did you know?
I saw your calendar.
It's kind of nice.
There isn't a 29th except leap year.
Makes it special somehow.
It is a special day.
I am getting so absent-minded.
I hope you're not expecting something fancy.
This is it.
It's a bit small.
I don't need much room.
I'd like it.
- Lf that's all right.
- That's great!
I'll discuss it with my husband, but I'm sure it won't be a problem.
Call me tomorrow and I'll let you know.
- Fine.
- We'll talk then.
I do hope this will work out.
I hope so, too.
I'm back.
That didn't take very long.
He didn't need much help.
About all he had was a suitcase.
But he did have first and last month's rent in cash.
Did you ask him to dinner?
I did. He said, "No, thanks."
Of course, he didn't use so many words.
The guy is out there.
He's a little bit different.
I don't know, I think he's just quiet.
He's quiet all right.
He doesn't have a stereo or a television.
He doesn't even want a telephone.
Really? That's weird.
What's weird is that he has a short-wave radio.
You think he's a spy?
The spearhead of an invasion force that will take over and bore us to death!
You're such a nut. Toss that up.
- Where are you going?
- I'm sure you did a great job inviting him.
Looks tossed to me.
- Jesus, you scared me to death.
- You snuck up on me!
I was trying not to scare you.
What are you doing?
Look at this. Isn't this wild?
Yeah, it is strange.
David's in the house.
He changed his mind about dinner.
Maybe he'd change it again if he saw you snooping.
I'm not snooping.
I'm looking.
So after all that, the senator wouldn't even see me.
This poor kid will die in the gas chamber and I get this aide who tells me...
...he doesn't think their involvement is appropriate.
Why?
Because he's a politician.
He won't get involved in anything that could come back and bite his fat ass.
- It's typical.
- It's typical bullshit.
What would you do?
Me? What do you mean?
Would you stop it?
Of course I would, but I have no control.
I can't do anything.
Maybe you can.
She can't do anything, David.
That's what I'm saying, nobody listens anymore. I'm the kid's attorney...
...and they won't listen to me.
So they won't listen to Abby.
Maybe you are right.
It's not up to us.
- How about dessert?
- Please.
Jesus Christ! Look at this!
Get a broom.
Please don't!
I wasn't going to hurt it.
I'm sorry.
That was weird.
Do you know...
...there's a story about a new-born child and the sparrow's song.
It's ancient.
Hebrew.
They believed that in Heaven...
...God's mansion has many halls.
And that one of these halls is the Hall of Souls.
It's called The Guf.
"The Guf"?
They say whenever a baby is born...
...this is where its soul comes from.
As the soul descends from heaven...
...only the sparrows can see it.
So they sing.
So whenever you hear a sparrow sing, you know a baby's about to be born?
The Guf. I like it.
I'll get the dessert.
- Would you like some coffee?
- Yes, please.
Wasn't that the sweetest story?
It sounded like a bunch of guff to me.
"The second angel poured his bowl into the sea.
"And it became as the blood of a dead man...
"... and every living thing...
"... died that was in the sea."
The prophecies...
...they have begun.
The Guf.
Do you like that?
I do. It reminds me of a story I heard.
It's Italian. Really good quality.
I don't know. I've spent so much money already.
But it's so cute. Yeah, why not?
You only live once, right?
Will this be on your card?
Mrs. Quinn, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Shit.
Excuse me, lady.
What are you doing here?
I'm looking for someone.
There's no one here but the minyan.
I followed him in, he's wearing a grey coat.
No one came in.
But I followed him in.
I've been here ten minutes.
No one has come in.
You okay?
Are you okay, lady?
Yes, I'm fine.
You better leave now.
We don't want to disturb kaddish.
Kaddish. The prayer for the dead.
You're going to be fine.
This won't hurt.
You'll just feel some pressure.
Don't hurt my baby.
- Keep breathing.
- Take a deep breath.
Just take a deep breath. There you go.
We're almost through.
You're doing just fine.
Just hold still. Breathe.
Take a deep breath.
Breathe. Nice and easy. Nice and easy.
You're doing a good job.
It's going to come out now.
Good job, good job.
Why does this keep happening to her?
It's too early for Caesarean.
Right. The baby's lungs aren't fully matured yet.
But the immediate threat is over.
Right now we have to keep her from going into labour for at least two weeks.
I've started her on ritodrine again.
Can she go home?
No. I want to keep her here for 48 hours.
She needs to rest as much as possible...
...both mentally and physically.
- Can I see her?
- Sure.
There she is.
How are you feeling?
It's not like the last time.
Don't even think about that.
Just rest.
I know that feeling. It's different this time.
Something else is causing it.
The pain isn't even the same.
It's not coming from the inside.
Margaret said you can come home in a couple of days.
Then a couple days in bed, you'll be as good as new.
Why won't she believe me?
Can't she find out what's really going on?
She's trying, Abby.
I know something's happening.
It's different this time.
I know it is.
"The third angel poured his bowl into the rivers, and they became...
"... blood."
Reports of more fighting near
the Nicaraguan border today.
In the fiercest confrontation of the year,
casualties are mounting on both sides.
Refugee camps have sprung up
in areas considered safe...
.... But even these have received sniper fire.
I love the news.
- How are you feeling?
- Good.
- Want some dinner?
- Want me to cook?
I'll take care of it.
How about some pasta primavera?
- Do you know how long that'll take?
- Twenty minutes. I'll go pick it up.
.... Rescuers can only watch
the great beings gasp for breath...
.... Away from what had always been,
for them and us...
.... The protective sea.
Locally, a different kind of tragedy today.
A drive-by shooting between rival gangs
claimed the lives...
.... Of a woman and her 4-year-old child.
Caught in the crossfire...
The death toll in this latest
terrorist bombing is expected to climb...
Bloodshed in the war
between Iraq and Iran...
.... Raped repeatedly, her body was dumped...
.... Was apparently set by representatives
of a radical...
In international news...
.... French officials announced
they have two suspects...
.... In the bombing
of the Champs Elysées restaurant...
Abby.
I'm sorry.
It's okay. I thought you were away.
I just came back.
No, please.
I just wanted to...
How do you feel?
I'm all right.
I thought I saw you the other day, in the rain.
I wasn't sure if it was you, but I thought you might need a ride.
You are very kind.
That's rare.
Were you there?
So much misery.
Man against man.
They kill each other. They have no faith.
I used to think the world would change...
...but it hasn't.
No, I guess it hasn't.
It's sad.
The course is chosen...
...and it can't be turned.
What do you mean, "course"?
Toward death.
I really don't think we'll blow ourselves up.
I didn't mean that.
I better go upstairs now.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry about the baby.
After all your travels, Father Lucci...
...you've reached these conclusions?
- I have, Your Eminence.
You have no doubt, no doubt whatsoever, regarding the signs?
No doubt at all. They were not signs.
Not to try your patience, Father, but once again:
The snow in the Negev.
Didn't the Israeli Army report that?
I was there.
I saw a freak, an aberration of convective showers.
Frigid air from the Balkans was swept into a cut off low.
It created a storm of such intensity, it sucked the freezing rain from the sky.
It turned everything in its path to ice.
A rare occurrence.
It happens once in 100 years.
But a sign from God?
Everything you saw...
...was either scientifically explainable or a hoax?
Yes, Your Eminence.
My brothers, all these things I saw were of the natural world.
There have been no miracles.
These were not signs of the Apocalypse.
I will tell His Holiness.
He will be quite relieved.
He has tickets next week to Faust.
"2- 29." That's the baby's birthdate.
I can't understand any of this.
What about the baby's birthdate on it?
We don't have a corner on February 29th.
You don't know that's what that means.
Have you ever seen strange writing like this?
And what about those horrible clippings?
Russell, he's here because of the baby!
You think David is responsible for what's wrong with the baby?
What's wrong with the baby is called placental insufficiency!
You're wrong! I told you, it's different!
It isn't! Nobody is trying to hurt the baby.
It's just like last time.
Abby, what do you want me to do?
Kick him out?
Would that make you feel better?
All right. He's gone.
I'll tell him as soon as I see him.
I'm looking for Dr. Ornstein.
Rabbi Ornstein.
You stay.
Are you Dr. Ornstein, the linguist?
Among other things. May I help you?
I hope so. I'm Abby Quinn.
Nice move, lady.
- What'd I do?
- You touched him.
You don't touch a Hasidic rabbi unless you're his wife.
- Are you serious?
- No. I'm making it up.
It's halakah. It's the law.
- I should apologise.
- I wouldn't do that.
Just leave. He won't see you again.
I have to see him.
I need to know what language this is.
That's Melachim.
It's Melachim.
It's a secret form of Hebrew, like a code.
In the Middle Ages, scholars used it to protect their writings.
You know it?
I hope so. I learned it from him when I was nine.
Then you can translate it?
I guess so. It's just a simple replacement alphabet.
Come on. There's a book I'll need.
Here it is.
So, what is this?
How does this date translate?
That's not a date.
Of course it is. 2-29. February 29th.
- Have you ever read the Bible?
- Well, yeah.
Well, 2:29, it's a Bible heading.
Chapter and verse.
Chapter 2, verse 29.
Are you sure?
The whole page is a quote from the Bible.
Book of Joel 2:29.
Can you read it for me?
"Even upon the menservants and maidservants in those days...
"... I will pour out my spirit.
"And I will give portents in the heavens and on the earth...
"... blood and fire and columns of smoke.
"The sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood...
"... before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes."
What is "the great and terrible day"?
When God passes judgement on mankind for its sins.
It's about the Apocalypse.
Come on! The end of the world?
That's what the portents are.
The sun going dark, the moon turning red.
They foretell the end of the world.
There's a whole chain of signs, like a countdown.
Earthquakes, plagues, water turning to blood.
All kinds of weird natural disasters.
They're to warn us that God's wrath is about to destroy the world.
That's what this paper's about?
Yeah, the signs of the end.
Didn't you go to Sunday school?
A long time ago. But they taught us that God was a God of love.
Are you okay?
But what do Biblical prophecies have to do with the baby?
Avi, would you translate it anyway, just to be sure?
Here's my number.
- I guess I could have it for you tomorrow.
- That would be great.
- Bye.
- Okay, Mrs. Quinn.
The Guf, 358.
"Ln Judeo-Christian mythology,
The Guf is the Hall of Souls.
"Every time an infant is born, this is where its soul comes from.
"Folklore says sparrows can see the soul's descent and this explains their song.
"But a day will come when the sparrow sings no more...
"... because there are only a finite number of souls in The Guf.
"Lt's when the last soul is used, and
The Guf is empty, that the world will end.
"The first infant born without a soul...
"... born dead as a soulless child must be, heralds...
"... the death of the world, and so is called...
"... T he Final Sign."
I'm trying to reach the governor.
It's urgent.
I told you it has to do with Jimmy Zaragoza's execution.
Russell, it's Abby.
I've already spoken to his aide.
I need to speak to him directly.
Yes, I'll hold. Tell her I'll call her back.
I tried, but she's not at home.
She says she must speak to you right now.
Cover for me. Abby, are you all...
It's not the baby's birth date, it's from the Bible.
He's here because of the baby.
Slow down.
He thinks it's a Bible sign!
He told us about it, but not the whole story. Listen:
"The first infant born without a soul, born dead as a soulless child must be... "
No, it's not! He's a religious fanatic!
He thinks if he can kill the baby, he'll end the world.
- Listen to me.
- I've got the governor.
Ask him to hold. I want you to go home.
All right? I promise.
Sorry, he wouldn't wait.
Oh, Christ!
Keep working on this and I'll try him from home.
Russell, are you here?
- You won't kill my baby.
- Your baby's dying because it has no soul.
- Don't say that.
- The Guf is empty!
I won't let you kill my baby.
Don't you think I cry for man?
I've tried to intercede, but God has judged!
- Man's sins are...
- Stay away!
I can't die again, Abby. I wish I could.
- I'm His messenger.
- You're crazy.
- I was here before.
- Stay away.
It's time for you to know, Abby.
I came as the Lamb...
...and I return as the Lion.
Now I am His wrath.
Strap her down!
It's happening!
Why won't you believe me?
You have to believe me.
Please.
Will you die for Him?
I don't know what you could have done.
This can happen.
I know the delusions seem extreme, but she's under enormous stress.
There's incredible guilt involved when...
Well, you certainly know the history.
What do we do now?
This sounds pathetic, but the best we can do is wait and see. Watch her.
The baby's fine. He's hanging in there.
If this is just an episode, she can go home in a couple of days.
Will you be able to stay with her?
- Not all the time.
- Then we should get you a nurse to help.
And I think you should go home now and get some serious rest.
Of course, God will judge the world.
- Could it be happening now?
- It could happen any time.
Jesus said the end would come like a thief in the night.
That belief is fundamental to every religion.
Moslem, Christian, Jew, Hindu.
There are differences amongst them as to how it will actually happen...
...but we all believe in a Messiah who delivers God's wrath...
...upon the world.
Then it could be happening.
The moon has turned to blood.
I told you about the paper and the fish.
Yes. In Revelation, it is written that the sea will die.
- Then you do see it?
- With perfect clarity.
I see a young man with a very large imagination.
What you're forgetting is that the prophetic signs are signs.
They're symbols.
They're not meant to be taken literally.
They're poetry written to describe the concept of greater divine judgement...
...not to be checked off like a laundry list.
So the moon and the fish?
Coincidence. You're forgetting the most important aspect of eschatology.
That when the end comes, with it comes eternal life...
...for those of us who are saved.
Well, who'll be saved, Reverend?
The Jew doesn't think it will be the Moslem.
The Moslem doesn't think it will be the Christian.
The Christian doesn't think it will be the Buddhist.
What if nobody is saved?
What if we're all wrong?
My God. What if it's just the Hare Krishnas?
- You're too young to worry so much.
- That's what my rabbi said.
Believe me, Avi, someday you'll make quite a philosopher.
If there is a someday.
Hello, Mr. Quinn. She's fine.
Could you give me that number again?
When? Well, I have to leave.
No, it's impossible...
No, she's upstairs resting.
I'll tell her.
I want my baby.
We still house noviciates here, of course.
But we do get quite a few guests, also.
Mostly people passing through on their way to new parishes.
- Is that what you're doing, Father Lucci?
- Yes, it is.
- Then you won't be staying very long?
- Father Morrell?
May I help you?
No, Father, this is Father Lucci.
I'm sorry. I thought that...
But the resemblance is...
...remarkable.
I don't believe we've met.
No, it couldn't be. That was long ago.
Very long ago.
If you'll excuse me.
But the resemblance...
...it's remarkable!
Really?
Good night, Father.
Abby?
Why is this happening?
God's grace is empty.
There's nothing I can do.
The signs have begun.
As each passes, the end grows closer.
Then why are you here?
I'm its deliverer. I'm its witness.
What if a sign didn't happen?
What if a sign could be stopped before my baby comes? What would happen?
Please, tell me.
Then the chain would be broken.
But it would take something you don't have.
Hope.
How can someone who cared so little for life...
...give life to the world?
I do care.
I'm going to try.
I'm going to try.
Any chance at all, sir?
What can you do now that the federal appeal has been denied?
With less than 24 hours to go, can you do anything to stop the execution?
"The windows of heaven," Mrs. Quinn...
"... the windows of heaven are open and the earth is rent asunder.
"Lt falls...
"... and will not rise again! "
Please, Mrs. Quinn, it doesn't have to be.
How do you know my name?
I followed the signs. They led me to you.
Who are you?
A priest who's come to help you and your baby. We don't have much time.
Please.
I know what you're going through.
I know what's going to happen.
Hey, Mrs. Quinn!
I must know everything he's told you if I'm to help.
He said if I can stop a sign, the chain will be broken.
He said that?
Yes, and God would grant the world a second chance.
Did he tell you which sign to stop?
No, I'm trying to figure it out.
No, no. That's impossible.
A sign can't be stopped.
He wouldn't have told me if there weren't a way.
That's why I have to know the other signs.
You said you knew them.
God has no secrets.
The signs are contained in the seven seals.
The first four have already begun.
The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.
And their signs are almost over.
- The fifth is the death of the last martyr.
- A death could be stopped.
But whose? Where?
- What about the sixth?
- The sun will turn to darkness...
...and the earth will quake and the stars shall fall from the sky.
"And when the Lamb opened the seventh seal...
"... there was silence in heaven."
The silence of The Guf, empty.
The stillbirth of the soulless child.
You are the seventh seal.
I'm not going to let my baby die.
One of the signs has to be stopped.
How? Do you know how?
With hope.
Can hope stop an earthquake?
Can it stop a murder halfway around the globe?
The fourth horseman still rides.
The angels have unleashed the winds from the corners of the earth.
Can you stop that with hope?
Will you die for Him?
Will you die for Him?
No!
You hit him in my dream.
It was no dream.
You were there.
You're not here to help.
You want the world to end.
Yes, Mrs. Quinn. For a very long time.
You are my deliverance.
There's nothing you can do.
You can't stop it.
What kind of God are you?
Let me in!
You were always nosy, Harold.
It is you, Morrell.
But that was 70 years ago.
That was just yesterday to me.
But you haven't aged.
You haven't changed.
In the name of God, how?
In the name of God is how.
I was cursed by Him for what I had done.
I struck a man.
But, of course, He was no man.
He was the Son of God.
I am Cartaphilus.
Pilate's gatekeeper?
The Roman soldier who was...
Cursed to walk the earth until the Messiah returned.
Cursed to live and never die, until it was time for the world to die.
And so it has been for 2,000 years.
For me, there's been no escape from the misery of life.
But I always knew my sentence would not be eternal.
And so, I win!
An end has come! My death is at hand.
I won't be stopped by anyone.
Not her, not you.
I can't allow it.
You understand, don't you, old friend?
Thank you.
Did you see him?
I'm gonna die?
I tried, Jimmy. I did everything I could.
They don't understand.
Do you think God will forgive them?
I don't know.
So we've got to stop this death.
Whose death?
I don't know.
It's somebody who's a martyr.
- That's the fourth sign?
- No, I think it's the fifth.
The last martyr, an earthquake and...
I don't know. I can't think anymore.
You should know this!
That's not my book, it's the New Testament.
Pull over. Pull over there!
- What are you doing?
- Getting us a Bible!
We need a room!
Thirty bucks.
- Got it. Revelation 5. "A Scroll... "
- Read me the sixth sign.
"When he broke the sixth seal, there was a great earthquake...
"... and the sun became black as sackcloth and the moon became red as blood."
An eclipse.
It's on my calendar for tomorrow.
Go back to the fifth sign.
"When He opened the fifth seal, I saw the souls of those slain for the word of God.
"They cried, 'Lord, when wilt thou avenge our blood on those on the earth? '
"They were told to rest until the number of their brethren was complete...
"... who were to be killed as they themselves had been."
The death of the last martyr.
It's someone who dies for the word of God, before the eclipse.
How?
Tortured to death? Murdered?
Executed.
Attorneys were unable to get
a stay of execution for Jimmy Zaragoza...
.... The "Word of God Killer,"
whose parents were brother and sister.
He murdered them, he said,
"because it was God's law."
This morning, Jimmy will die
according to man's law.
Hello?
Abby, where are you?
Russell, I know how to stop it.
An eclipse?
Abby, I can't stop the execution.
You must. He is the last martyr.
You can't let them kill him.
There's nothing I can do.
Tell me where you are.
Abby, are you all right?
I'll meet you at the prison.
No! You can't stop...
I'm going to leave now.
Penny! Thank God! You've got to get me in! You've got to help me.
Okay, breathe, breathe.
Stop!
Somebody stop him!
I did it. It's over.
Somebody...
Somebody help us!
No!
Somebody help us!
It's all right, Abby.
God, no!
Sorry. It's all my fault.
It's all right, Abby.
Breathe deeply.
Relax. Breathe.
All right, push.
- Breathe, Abby.
- Push!
You're fine.
It's all right. You're doing good.
Deep breaths!
Can you do it one more time?
One more time, Abby.
That a girl. Come on, push!
Hold on! The head is out!
Come on, sweetheart, we're almost there!
We've lost the baby's heartbeat.
Will you die for Him?
Will you die for Him?
Yes, I will!
I will die for Him.
I will die for Him.
He's beautiful, Abby...
...just like you said he'd be.
You can't see him...
...but you know.
You always knew.
The Hall of Souls is full again.
It was you, Abby.
Just the one person with hope enough for the whole world.
Remember it all.
Write it down.
Tell it...
...so people will use the chance she has given them.
My leg! My leg!
My leg!
My leg!
Okay.
My leg!
My leg!
My leg!
My leg! My leg!
My leg!
My leg!Aaah!
Th... That's me!
What the hell's going on?
It's time to return.
Look into his eyes.
I can't believe it.
MAN: Listen.
In almost all instances, coronary occlusion results from arteriosclerosis, a degenerative disease of the arteries caused by development of fatty fibrotic deposits in the arterial wall.
The endothelial cell damage in the inside surface of the artery causes a two-fold effect, so the smooth muscle cells lying deep in the endothelium start to multiply and protrude against the endothelium cell lining.
Fatty substances begin to deposit around the muscle cells, causing development of a fibrotic lesion.
Now, when the aortic or pulmonary arteries are obstructed, you're into the area of myocardiac infarctions or neurosis of the myocardium.
Got it, Chris?
Yeah.
It sounds more difficult than it is.
Let's go over it again.
No, I think I understand.
When the aortic or pulmonary arteries are obstructed, you're into the area of myocardiac infarctions or--

Chris, you can't

There's nothing that fascinates me more than the human body, and no part of the human body is quite as mysterious and wondrous as the heart, so let's start with the aorta, and work our way through the entire system... uh... by which blood is distributed through the body.
Damn!
Uh... uh... but when the aortic or pulmonary arteries are obstructed, you're into the area of myocar--

Dr. Hammond.
Dr. Hartwood on four.
This is
Mr. Racine.
He's 47.
Two days ago, he underwent an aortic valve replacement.
How are you feeling today, Mr. Racine?
I don't know, doc.
My right leg kinda hurts and I'm burning up.
Mr. Racine has a low-grade fever and is exhibiting tenderness in his lower right calf.
Undoubtedly phlebitis.

In such cases, an anticoagulant is prescribed.
For such minor incidents as this,

I would suggest

This gentleman doesn't give a rat's ass about hospital policy, and neither do I.
A hospital's a place where people come to get well.
Um, scurry on. I'll catch up.
I know you think only rich people should get sick, but it just doesn't work that way.
I'm sorry, Dr. Larkin, but there's nothing I can do.
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Put him in there for me.
Keep shouting.
There's a few patients you haven't disturbed.
I've got a man here complaining of chest pains.
He's got to be admitted right away.
She's got a man with no insurance.
I don't know where she keeps finding them.
Send him to County.
There you have it.
What?
You know what the policy is.
No insurance--
Policy, shmolicy!
This man needs medical attention.
Remember how to do that, Jack?
You used to.
You used to be the best surgeon in this city.
Still am. Send him to County.
Good morning, all.
What seems to be the problem?
Oh, money and my patient's lack of it.
Dr. Larkin, if you want to carry this crusade any further. bring it up again at the board meeting.
An have them kick my ass again?
If the shoe fits.
Mind if I join you on rounds, Jack?
No.
Sorry.
County will treat you fine.
Chris, I thought it was a great speech.
It started out about the heart and ended up being about the brain... damage.
Oh, wait, there she is.
There she is, man.
Lori
Shh, shh.
Where, where?
All right, man. Now, all
I have to do is ask her.
Well, you could split up the tickets and give her one, and when she goes, she'll be sitting right next to you, and then let the fun begin.
No, she is great.
She is so great.
No, I can't do it. No.
I'm selling the tickets.
You can do it.
You can do it.
Just walk up to her, look her right in the eye, and say, "Lori, will you go with me
"to the concert tomorrow night?
And if not, I'll set fire to you."
How can she stand to be so close to her own body without constantly feeling herself up?
Chris? Go.
Oh, right.
Do I look all right?
You look good. Breath.
No, no, no, Trigger.
I can't. I can't, man.
If you could just go up there and ask her out for me, tell her
I injured my voice rescuing hostages or something.
Uh, hi.
Hi.
Hi, Charlie.
No, it's Chris.
Um, Lori, I was just wondering, tomorrow night, if, uh, you weren't doing anything, that maybe we could go out, or if you were doing something,
I understand, or even if you weren't doing anything and didn't want to, that'd be okay.
Are you serious?
No, not really, but it was just that, uh, well,
I wound up with these two tickets to a concert tomorrow night and I thought that... that since you remind me so much of Heather Thomas--
Locklear.
Locklear, that, um--
Well, what are the seats like?
Front row--
Aisle or center?
Center.
Look, sorry I canceled our date for tomorrow night, babe, but my parents are forcing me to go to my grandmother's for dinner.
It's a really big deal to her.
Well, it doesn't matter, Rick.
I'm going to the concert with, uh...
Uh, Chris.
Hey, Rick.
Him?
He considers me more important than his grandmother.
Right, Chris?
Right. Nothing.
Nothing.
She means nothing to me, right, Trigger?
Hates her.
Fine, if that's the way you want to play.
Larry, I have been in your office for 15 minutes.
Don't keep me waiting.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ginnie.
Mm.
I was making rounds with Jack.
His wife is dead, so he can take all the time he likes.
Hello, Jack.
It's been a while.
Yes, far too long, Ginnie.
Dear, I hope you're going to take my advice and make Jack the next
Chief of Staff.
Well, I may just do that.
He's a good man.
Lord knows they're hard to find.
Well, I'll...
I'll be happy to serve this hospital in any capacity you see fit.
Either of you.
Hmm.
Excuse me.
Dr. Armbruster?
May I interrupt you for a moment?
Yes, of course.
I'll be right back.
Jack, entertain my wife in your patented manner, will you?
I shall make the attempt.
Modesty, thy name is Jack.
Hmm.
I wonder if you know what you could do to really entertain me.
Well, wait a minute.
Let me think.
Why are you always so shy?
Why are you always so married?
You were performing a very delicate operation in a dream I had last night.
Then I suppose
I'd be wrong to bill you.
You had very sure hands.
I wonder what it would be like if I were awake.
Most operations are best performed with the patient asleep.
Ah.
Yes.
Dear, he definitely has the ability to handle people.
I think he's a born administrator.
Jack, you should appoint this woman your campaign manager.
Well, I would if I was campaigning for Chief of Staff.
Instead,
I remain quasi-available and fashionably aloof.
Oh, that's good.
That's very good.
Aren't you late for surgery?
Yes, I am.
Well, then.
Well, then.
Oh. So cool.
You want to stick it in
Tisdale's lunch for a laugh?
No, I can't do this.
I'm sorry, I...
This is wrong.
No, it's, no.
No.
Dr. Hammond.
You seem to be hoping this frog will commit suicide.
I suggest you overcome your delicate sensibilities or fail class for the day.
Do I make myself clear?
Crystal clear, sir.
Attaboy, Hammond.
Start at the gizzard, slice this sucker open, and scoop out the intestines.
Piece of cake.
Kill, kill, kill, kill.
Ka, ka, ka, ka.
Kill, kill, kill, kill.
Ugh.
Sorry.
Blood pressure is too low.
You want him on dopamine?
I just want his pressure up.
Aye-aye, captain.
Let's get him stable.
I want to get him off the bypass.
You're in a good mood, Jack.
I had to tutor Chris for his biology midterm, and then spent the rest of the night and the early morning getting the equipment forecasts for this bloody hospital.
No pun intended.
Let's come off bypass.
NURSE: We're off,
Dr. Hammond.
When you're
Chief of Staff, do I call you chief?
"O, Exalted One" will do.
We're losing one hell of a surgeon, Jack.
You're right.
What do you say we go out for a couple of drinks tonight?
You never socialize anymore.
You haven't been out of the house since Jan passed away.
No, I don't think so.
Close for me, please.
Way to gut it out, Hammond.
You're pacing yourself.
I like that kick you're using.
Hey, it's the Hammond Kick!
Hammond Kick, huh?
Well, it's official.
Hammond, you're on anchor at the Districts tomorrow.
Anderson, you lead off.
Come on, Coach.
It was a fluke.
You can't make
Hammond anchor.
I just did.
Hit the showers!
I'm warning you, Hammond.
You're getting in my face too often.
You better watch your step, dickhead.
Look, Rick, come on.
We're on the same team.
What do you say we just call a little truce, okay?
Okay, for the good of the school, asshole.
Hey, Rick.
What?
Nice race.
Look, Rick, whatever you want, okay?
Come on, Rick.
Leave him alone.
He's a good kid.
Yeah, well, you better watch your step, dickhead.
That guy is huge.
I mean, what is it?
A glandular disorder or what?
I don't know, but sooner or later, he is going to freak, and I wouldn't want to be here when he does.
I think there should be a size requirement for high school.
Oh, God!
How bad?
The worst.
Look. A "C."
A "C"?
A "C."
I am dead meat.
I am sitting on a hook, rotting in the sun.
Flies are, like, gathering around me.
I am dead meat.
For what?
For a "C"?
My dad would give me his porno collection if I got a "C."
A "C"? I cannot believe a "C."
TRIGGER: Hey, thanks for the ride, Chris.
Good luck at home.
Hey, man, there is no good luck at home.
Only death by lasers emitted from my father's eyes.
Ah, you'll get into a med program somewhere.
Hey, man, what's that?
That's my Uncle Earl.
He's been staying with us for the last couple of days, stinking up the house.
He's leaving today.
Probably on his way to Venus.
Hey, Earl, how you doing?
Pretty creepy-looking to me, there, Trigger.
Yeah, he's an archaeologist.
Creepy is his life's work.
Hey, listen,
I gotta get home so my father can end my life.
Oh, wait, let me see if I can get him talking about his brain transference serum.
It could make med school obsolete.
Brain transference serum.
He was talking about it last night.
He's got it in those boxes up there.
The one marked
"Brain Transference
Serum."
You gotta keep an open mind about it.
You should see the scar on his leg.
Hey, Earl, can you tell my friend about how the Indians operated on your leg and you didn't feel anything?
No.
Great talking to you, Earl.
I'll get him to talk about it.
Just wait.
Nah. Forget it, man.
Look, I'll see you tomorrow, and if brain transference has anything to do with having your head handed to you, you and your Uncle Earl can come on over to my house and watch.
See you tomorrow.
Later.
ANNOUNCER: MTV.
It's an attitude.
MTV.
I'm a real wild one.
WOMAN'S VOICE:
Sit tight and listen carefully while I...
Hi, man.
I thought you were my dad.
Nope. Taller.
Uh, Tabasco sauce?
Brain transference serum.
Oh, shit.
Trigger, what are you doing?
Hey, dude, I went through a lot of trouble siphoning this stuff off from my uncle without him seeing it.
Now, we can at least try it.
Yeah, right.
I'm gonna try this stuff.
Come on.
No.
You're not gonna try anything.
Hello, Seymour.
I have a little present for you.
All right, come on.
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
Come on, this stuff looks like cooking oil.
Yeah, well, let's see what it can do.
Well, be careful, be careful.
Trigger, come on.
This is stupid.
Trigger, how did that happen?
Did you ever see
The Emerald Forest, where the guy, he swallows some stuff and turns into a panther?
No.
Same principle.
Hey, did either of you notice anything unusual about Seymour and
Sparky today?
No.
No.
Oh, gosh, it's my dad.
I'm out of here.
Terrific.
Come on, Trig.
Just stay for dinner and lessen the blow.
Will you relax?
I don't see what the big deal is.
You just blew an assignment.
Yeah, I know.
It's a big deal.
You know my dad.
Look, you don't want to be in med school anyway.
Now, if I was you,
I'd tell the Ayatollah to get off my back, Jack.
Dr. Hammond!
What a delightful surprise.
Isn't it?
Uh, Trigger, you're staying for dinner.
Well?
How'd you do, Chris?
You know, doc, that's a great jacket.
It really brings out...
The color in my eyes.
Yeah, right. Chris?
Um, the grades aren't being posted till Monday, so I don't know.
Monday?
I was hoping you'd hear before the weekend.
Yeah, I know, but, uh...
Oh, listen, Dad,
I'm running anchor in the mile relay at the District
Championships tomorrow.
Well, good.
Be sure to mention that to the guy from Northwestern on Friday.
Dr. Hammond,
I'm leaving in a minute.
The spaghetti's nearly ready, the bread is in the oven, and the salad's in the fridge.
Aba-daba-daba-dab.
See you later, Phyllis.
What?
Right.
Dad, I need to talk to you about that interview with the guy from Northwestern.
How about that interview with Lori Beaumont?
Well, you re-confirmed it, didn't you?
Uh, yeah.
Damn right. I mean, let's face it. You lucked out.
She's major league action.
I didn't think you had a prayer.
You said I was the ultra dude.
Yeah, but I didn't mean it.
I mean, she's used to going out with guys that look like a cross between Don Johnson and Sylvester Stallone.
Oh, yeah?
So what does that make me?
Well, you're more of a cross between Sylvester Stallone and Don Knotts.
Oh, yeah?
Well, you're like a cross between, uh,
Don Knotts and Sylvester the Cat with, like, maybe a lint ball mixed in for IQ purposes.
Hey, dude, after what you got on that biology presentation,
I don't think you qualify to be making
IQ judgments.
I mentioned that jacket already, haven't I?
Herringbone or something?
What the hell did you get?
Oh, oh, oh, you mean the actual grades.
Well, those are gonna be posted on Monday, but, um, Trigger is...
Trigger's talking about the...
Temporary! Temporary!
They can change at any time.
They're just temporary grades, and those are gonna, like, change without notice, so for the time being,
I...
It may appear that I... may have gotten a...
A "C."
A "C." What actually--
A "C"
TRIGGER: So, uh, thanks for the chow, Chris, and glad I could be of help.
Doc, again, great wardrobe.
Thousands of herrings must have died for that jacket.
A "C"?
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I really...
I tried my best, but I'm just not...
Hammonds just don't get "Cs."
Chris?
Dad?
I don't fucking believe it.
Chris?
Dad?
TRIGGER: Oh, shit.
Ugh! Ugh!
Are you in there?
Yeah, Dad.
I'm old.
I don't believe it.
Uh...
All right, just stay calm.
There's bound to be a very... rational... scientific... explanation for all of this.
There is.
You put Tabasco sauce in your Bloody Mary.
Oh, God.
Dr. Hammond...
Dr. Hammond...
I feel a little responsible about what's happened here.
Uh-huh.
See, it started out, we were fooling around with my uncle's brain transference serum--
There's no such thing as a brain transference.
No sweat.
Uh, I seem to remember my uncle saying something about it not lasting very long.
I can ask him, uh, but he's gone.
Well, not dead.
Just gone.
Listen to me, you little asshole.
I don't care where your uncle is, or what you have to go through to find him, but you go right now and do whatever the hell you have to do to get us out of this thing, and if you don't, you'll never finish puberty.
Do I make myself clear?
Oh!
Sorry, Dad.
Trigger.
Trigger.
Oh, boy. Oh, no.
Dr. Hammond?
Is that you?
No. Uh, yes.
I was just wondering if you'd seen my cat.
No.
No. Damn cat.
Uh, well, then,
Walter,
I wonder, uh... could I have a word alone with your fine boy, Clarence?
Sure.
I'll see you at the front door!
* Well, all around town
My name is mud *
* But I can't help it
'Cause it's in my blood *

Uh-huh.
I'll have a martini.
You want that on the rocks?
No, in a glass is fine, and could I have some ice with that, please?
And what would be your finest champagne?
Louis Roederer Cristal, and you're not getting any.
Yeah.
This sucks.
I'm gonna cruise the joint, gets me a woman.

* Oh
* It's a cold war *
Well, well, well.
Who have we here?
We have... moi.
Me.
When I saw you a moment ago, a shiver ran through my body.
Do you think I need something to warm me up?
You mean like a hot chocolate?
I was thinking of something a little more personal and a lot more private.
Private, as in just you and me?
Can't think of anyone else
I'd like to invite.
Okay.
Okay?
Uh, the place is full of nuns.
Hello, there. How you doing?
The name's Trigger, as in horse, as in "hung like."
Uh, this is... my son's friend.
Oh.
Yeah, see, me and him, we're inseparable.
Yeah.
The age difference doesn't matter because I think like an adult, and I also do other things like an adult.
Yeah.
Um, I have to go.
It's been charming to meet your son's friend.
The charm was all mine.
I'll be seeing you.
Yeah, sure.
Any time.
Any time?
Sure.
Let's rock and roll.
* Everybody have fun tonight
On the house!
* Everybody Wang
Chung tonight *
* Everybody have fun tonight
Whoo!
...and I'm Wally.
We have some lines open right now, so give us a call.
All right, you're on the air.
MAN: Uh, oh, hi, Wally?
Yeah, hi.
I'm a first-time caller.
All right. Thanks.
COMPUTER VOICE:
The key is in the ignition.
The key is in the ignition.
The key is in the ignition.
The key is in the igni...
Now, what do you mean by that?
"Leave it or live with it."
Well, you know, like an alligator...
Some alligators have teeth that can kill an adult.
What happens when the good guys have no gun...
The key is in the ignition.
Right, right.
Now, that's the type of moronic answer that I get every morning here.
Aaah!
Aaah!
Aaah!
Oh, shit!
The key is in the ignition.
The key is in the ignition.
What the hell have you done to me?
Dad, could you hold it down a little?
You're drunk.
You're drunk.
No. I'm dead.
You're damn right you're dead.
Jesus, Chris, look at you.
You've been out all night doing God knows what in my body.
All right!
Using my cash, probably boozing it up, and where in the hell did you get the money to pay for an outfit like that?
I only had $20 in my wallet.
Well, Dad--
My credit card.
My...
You used my credit card!
Get in the house.
You are grounded... for the rest of your life!
Yeah, all right!
Lean on him!
Up yours.
The key is in the ignition.
Do you mind? I'm on a diet.
Oh.
Sorry, sorry. I forgot.
Hey, good morning,
Dr. Hammond... or Chris.
Whatever.
Hey, what happened with Uncle Earl?
You look like a geek.
What about Earl?
Well, it seems there's no phones in the
Zocolo rainforest, but I did leave a message with the chief of their local police, and Uncle Earl should be getting back to us pronto!
Well, pronto isn't good enough.
Don't worry.
I'll find him.
Chris, um, here's your excuse for missing work today.
I want you to call my...
I want you to call my office at precisely 9:00 a.m. and read this note, okay?
Hey, Dad, where're you going?
To school.
What?
Hey, Dad! Come on!
You'll wreck everything.
What are you doing?
Chris, it's the best thing.
See you later, Chris!
Dad, come on!
Come on, you can't do this!
That's my school!
You'll ruin everything!
This is the best thing, Son.
Trust me.
You can't go to my school, for God's sake!
Come on, stop!
Now, I don't want you leaving this house under any circumstances until I get home.
I'm not gonna let you do this!
All right! Kill your own son!
All right. Have a good time.
Dad!
* Dude looks like a lady

LORI: No! I told you already.
You had your chance.
I'm going to the concert with Chris Hammond.
Come on, the guy's a dork.
What's he got that I haven't got?
Excuse me, son.
A Jaguar, for starters.
Excuse me.
I'm gonna park there, all right?
Uh, may I advise you not to do that, sir?
That's Rick Anderson.
Never heard of him.
Come on, let's go.
I wouldn't do that, sir.
Chris, are you all right?
You look kind of funny.
Um, ah, yes, yes.
I'm really looking forward to the concert tonight.
What concert?
Are mag wheels optional on the XJ6?
See you.
Does this sort of thing happen... often?
Doc, it's really not cool to scam on your own son's date.
Look!

Dr. Hammond, it's nearly 9:30.
You should be at work.
Oh!
Yeah.
Uh, hi, Norma.
Yeah.
Uh, this is Chris... uh, Chris' father,
Dr. Hammond.
Norma, I'm gonna be unable to come to the hospital for the next few days because I'm suffering from an acute attack
120-hour flu and a very severe case of laryn... laryngitis.
Uh, yeah.
Please refer all my calls and appointments to Dr. Roger Hartwood.
Thank you.
The main bronchi... are distributed around the whole circumference of the tubes.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
What, did you fart?
Move.
Stop that!
"Stop that!
Stop that!"
Excuse me, is that seat taken?
No, we saved it just for you, dude.
Well, thank you.
Well, well, good morning,
Hammond.
I do apologize for dragging you in here so early.
That's quite all right.
Hammond, do you think you have a strong grasp of the respiratory system?
Very strong.
Well, then, up to the board.
Okay.
Well, Dr. Hammond says he has a strong grasp of today's material.
We'll give him a chance to prove it by sharing his vast knowledge of the respiratory system with us.
Hammond, why don't you complete the diagram for all of us?
Okay.
Well, your sketch work here is a bit remedial, although it does have a certain kindergarten charm.
The main bronchi and its branches present only irregular cartilaginous plates.
Oh, Dr. Armbruster?
Dr. Armbruster?
Dr. Hammond just called, said he wasn't feeling very well, wouldn't be coming in.
Well, that's a first.
It must be serious.
You know,
I'm having lunch out that way.
I'll drop by and check on him.
Dr. Hammond?
Dr. Hammond?
Uh
I'm going out for some groceries.
I will be back in about an hour.
* Whoo
* She's only 15
* She's the reason
The reason that
I can't sleep *
* You say illegal
* I say legal's
Never been my scene *
* Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah!
* I try like hell
But I'm out of control *
A quasi-humorous side-note to this election is that Martin Van Buren, who'd been born and raised in
Kinderhook, New York and was known as
"Old Kinderhook," issued campaign materials shortening "Old Kinderhook" to "O.K."
"Martin Van Buren is O.K.," which is where we get the term
"okay."
Thank you, Chris, for that footnote.
Can anyone tell me what effect
Martin Van Buren's election had on the country?
Anyone else?
The effect of this election on the country was fascinating.
CHRIS: Yeah! Whoo!
* There she was
For all the world to see *
Whoo! Whoo!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Whoo! Whoo!
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Jack?
Dr. Armbruster.
Looks like you're feeling much better.
Yeah, I was just checking the light bulb.
Good.
That's good.
All right, then.
Well, we'll see you back at the hospital in say, uh... oh... an hour.
Right.
Bye.
Shit.
What we're doing here, folks, is trying to define the distance between two points.
This is the formula we use to define that distance.
Who did that?
He did.
Holy shit.
Is that Hammond?
Hello, Dr. Hammond.
Nice Jeep.
Your son's?
Uh, no, it's mine.
Uh, his.
I mean,
I just, uh... keep it around to, you know... haul stuff.
It's great.
You like it?
Yeah, I used to have a '78 just like it, only it was black.
Yeah, it was jacked up, had these great ol' roll bars and heavy-duty shocks, four on the floor.
Great.
Sir...
This is a complete overhaul job. I did it myself.
I got it from some chick who completely burned out the transmission.
Sir, you're chewing gum.
Oh, yeah. You want some?
Oh, no, thanks.
I, uh...
No, thank you.
Okay, listen, um...
I gotta bail.
I'll catch you guys later?
Bail?
Good morning,
Dr. Hammond.
Hey, what's happening?
Ooh.
Good morning, sir.
Hey.
Good morning, Jack.
Que pasa?
[BABIES CRYING,
PEOPLE SHOUTING]
Take him to Ward Three.
Out of the way, out of the way.
I'll need a tracheal surgeon.
Dr. Hammond,
Dr. Hammond,
I've been looking everywhere for you.
Could you look in on your bypass--
I can't. No, I'm sorry.
I've gotta go to the office.
Um, isn't that
Bob over there?
Where did you go off to?
I made some phone calls.
I've now left messages for Uncle Earl with every tribal chief in the hemisphere.
He'll turn up.
Or your ass.
So what are we eating?
I don't know you, doc.
No offense, but get away from me.
Trigger, that is loaded with nitrates.
I like nitrates.
You might as well be licking the floor of a slaughterhouse.
Goodbye, doc.
I'll see you at graduation.
Trigger, listen.
It's rough out there in the real world.
I know.
I'm trying to get Chris into a good college, and you should be thinking about that also.
You're both seniors now.
Later, you can have all the fun you want.
When?
Well, congratulations, doc.
You made it to total outcast in just three hours and 42 minutes, beating a record set just a few decades back by a young Charles Manson.
Dr. Abrams, call 6105.
Dr. Abrams, call 6105.
Dr. Hammond to
Nursing Central. Dr. Hammond to Nursing Central.
Uh, no calls, no visitors, okay?
I'm gonna be real busy.
Testing...
Shit.
How are you feeling today?
"I'm not so bad, th-th-thank you."
Now, then.
I have some bad news for you,
Mr. or Mrs. Matsil.
Jack?
Yeah?
I was hoping you could do rounds for me today.
Rounds of... rounds of... rounds of what?
Great rounds.
Well, uh...
Dr. Hammond? Mr. Racine.
He's over there.
Who?
Uh, Racine.
We're supposed to see him.
Uh... yeah.
Dr. Hammond?
Dr. Hammond?
Hmm?
Oh.
Mr. Racine.
Oh, hi, doc.
Hi.
Doc.
What's your name?
Me, sir?
Yeah.
It's O'Donald, sir.
Yeah, I know that, but your first name.
You wanna know my first name?
Yeah.
It's Mike, sir.
Mike?
Okay, why don't you take this,
Mike?
Subject, age 47, underwent an aortic valve replacement.
Phew! God!
During post-op, he complained of pain in his lower right calf and exhibited low-grade fever.
Phlebitis was diagnosed.
What do you think we should do?
You want my opinion?
Uh-huh. Sure.
I think...
I think we should increase his daily dosage of Coumadin to 12 milligrams.
Coumad... Coumadin? Coumadin.
Uh, does this sound right to you guys?
Anybody think that's a bad idea?
No.
No.No.
Sounds good to me.
Okay.
That's it.
12 milligrams of Coumadin.
And don't worry, Mr. Racine.
We're not gonna let you die.
Are we, guys?
No.
No.No.
God, this is great! I love it!
Okay, who's next?
Hey, come on.
You take a crack at this one.
He's got a machine.
Yo!
Come on. Look.
Well, it's a good thing you're going home now, doc, while there's still a few kids who like you.
They'll learn to like me once they get to know me.
Yeah, well, most of these kids will be out of here in four years.
Hey, Chris, good luck today.
Good luck?
In the track meet.
No, doc.
Don't even think about it.
Why not?
Because--
In this body,
I can run like the wind.
Damn!
Doc!
In his latest report,
Mr. Taylor made a similar conclusion.
In this particular case, the financial burdens on the hospital might cause a budgetary strain.
I believe this is something we should all think about, and in regards to the Sudbury matter, they did find that the low pyroxin levels caused the rate of oxidation to produce, uh, sulfitanic goiter, manifesting the comprising ganglia of the lower autonomic nervous system, which would, in all probability, produce, uh, solvetania.
Well, actually, that, uh... that concludes my report.
Um...
Uh...
Uh...
Very interesting, what you were say... um, what you were saying, and, uh...
I think that a lot of... a lot of good things can be, uh... said about the stuff... that, uh, that guy said, and, um... really.
Very interesting.
Very interesting, what we have here.
Right?
Great.
Thank you, Jack.
You bet.
Right, now, uh... well, I think we should, um... send Dr. Selwyn's proposal to committee.
Do we have a second for that?
All right, fine.
May the record show... that Dr. Gilden seconded the motion.
Uh, let's...
Oh. Now, let's see what's next on the agenda.
Oh, yeah.
The matter of, uh... of indigent care.
Uh-oh, here it comes.
Now, perhaps we can be brief.
The materials are in front of you.
I think they speak for themselves.
Do we have a motion to--
You certainly do.
I thought we might.
Uh, Dr. Larkin, do you have a seconder?
All right, then, uh... next item.
Now, wait a minute.
Hold on. You haven't even thought about this.
You've got people out there who are sick and dying, and their only sin is that they don't have the money to get in here.
Now, I always thought that our first obligation as doctors was to help people who need medical attention.
We are shirking that duty.
Now, I realize that this is a private hospital, but surely--
Dr. Larkin, we've been through all this before many times, and you know the insurance rules are very strict, and they're not unreasonably--
Will you at least send it to committee?
We can't send everything to committee.
Do you have a second? Now, you have to have a second.
Do you have one?
Oh, come on.
Are you all so afraid of offending Dr. Armbruster that you won't send this to committee?
Well, Dr. Larkin, you are, as they say in the vernacular of one of your indigent people, you're shit out of luck.
Hey, I'll second it.
Screw the insurance.
Well, Jack, you're full of surprises today.
First the gum and the... the cigarette trick and the little fire and now this, huh?
Well, let the record show that Dr. Hammond seconded the motion.
Dr. Larkin, it would appear that your issue is going to go to committee.
Hey, are we out of here of what?
Jack?
Jack.
Uh... you were a revelation.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Oh, sure, Amy.
"Amy"?
Whoa, let's see some I.D.
What do you mean?
Well, no, I mean,
I just can't believe that that was you back there.
I mean, since when did you start taking sides with me?
Well, it just seems to me that if people are sick, then you have to try and help them out.
I mean, screw the insurance.
It's part of the hypocritical oath, isn't it?
Hypocritical oath.
You know, that took a lot of courage, what you did in there, and frankly,
I... Well, I didn't think you had it in you.
Ah, it was nothing.
Nothing, huh? To say that in front of Armbruster?
It took a lot of guts, even if the
Chief of Staff job wasn't on the line.
Big balls, Jack.
Big ones. Huge.
Dr. Hammond, you're a godsend.
I can't stabilize him.
He's in VTACH.
Well, I...
I'm not Dr. Hammond.
His rate's increasing, and I think he's going into VFIB.
Whack him one!
Hit him, Dr. Hammond!
Did you hit him yet?
Yeah.
Oh, God,
I'm getting nothing.
Whack him some more.
But I don't even know him!
Beat on the son of a bitch.
Beat him hard.
Hurry, we're losing him.
All right, right now.
Let's move, people.
He's in VFIB.
Come on, give me the backboard right now.
Stand by with one amp of bicarb.
All right, I need one amp of bicarb.
I'm standing by.
No response.
Let's defib.
All right, stand clear, and clear!
Hello.
Good to see you.
How are you?
Good running.
Good luck.
Don't need it.
Right.
Runners to the block.
Take your mark.
Set.
All right, Rick! Way to gain!
Hammond! Hammond!
Come on!
Hey. Get to your mark.
Go on.
Right.
Take it easy!
Rick's got us a nice lead!
Don't blow it, asshole.
Nothing to it, Hammond!
It's a cakewalk!
Get 'em, guys!
There you go!
What are you doing, Chris?
Come here!
Come back here!
Chris!
Hammond, get back there!
Come on, Hammond! Come on!
Just beat one team, Hammond!
Just one!
Come on, Hammond!
Use the kick! Use the kick!
Where the hell is the Hammond Kick?
Did I win?
Close.
Uh, you dove
10 yards too soon, doc.
You still haven't crossed the finish line.
Oh.
Hi, Dr. Hammond.
Hi, Jack.
Hi, Jack.
Hey, you guys all right?
Yes, sir. We're all right.
Hey, I've got jumper cables.
Great.
I wonder what Chris is doing right now.
Hey, dickhead!
Uh-oh.
Here comes more pain.
Your ass is mine.
I gave at the track.
Just agree with him.
Agree with him that you're a dickhead.
Come on, buddy, let's go!
Right now.
You wanna have a fist fight?
Oh, you got it, dork vomit.
"Dork vomit"?
Apologize.
Why? I didn't do anything wrong.
What does that have to do with it, doc?
He can mangle you.
He's only a kid.
So are you.
Come on, buddy.
Let's rock and roll.
I'm gonna teach you a lesson. Come on, man.
Come on, get out of the car, man.
Come on, get out!
Let's go.
Come on, let's rock and roll, man. Come on.
Hey, where you going, you little suck?
Huh
Huh? Come on, man.
Ow!
Ow! God!
Ow.
Oh, yeah?
Come back, you little bastard!
Ow! Ow!
Chris?
Chris?
Chris... is home.
Chris is home.
Phyllis, where's Dad?
Your father left for the hospital four or five hours ago.
He did what? Dammit.
That little bastard can't follow a simp...
* Jeremiah was a bullfrog
* Was a good friend of mine
* I never understood
A single word he said *
* But I helped him
Drink his wine *
Hasta luego, mi amigos!
* Jeremiah was a bullfrog
Yeah!
* Was a good friend of mine *
Yeah!
Oh! Whoo!
Hi, Pop.
What were you doing with my interns?
Oh, you know, hanging out.
A couple of pizzas, a couple of beers.
You ate pizza with my interns?
It wasn't my idea.
They asked me.
Hey, hey, Dad, what happened in school today?
Nothing. School was easy.
You didn't see patients, did you?
No, no, I just went on some rounds.
Did you talk to Lori?
Wait a minute. Rounds?
You went on rounds?
I gave out some pills.
Everybody feels fine.
What kind of pills, Chris?
You didn't talk to Armbruster, did you?
I didn't talk to anybody.
Anybody asked me a question
I gave them a pill.
You lost, right?
Not by very much.
Dad, lost is lost.
I mean, what happened?
I won that spot.
I'm pretty sure someone cheated.
Cheated?
What are you talking about?
False start or something?
Dr. Hammond.
I don't believe it.
No. Chris.
Yo.
Uh, no, who's this?
This is Chris.
Lori!
No, no, this is Chris.
Really? Um... hold on a minute.
I've just got to clear my throat.
Dad. Dad, you got to talk to her.
She thinks she's talking to you.
She is.
Yeah, but she wants to talk to me.
Hello?
No. Uh-uh.
Um, Lori, could you hold for a moment?
My father wants to speak to me.
Dad, you can't cancel.
She's your date.
Yeah, but it's our first date.
I mean, if I... if I cancel now, she may never, ever say yes again.
Ever!
Please.
What do you want me to do?
Uh, tell her you'll pick her up in 15 minutes.
15 minutes--
Tell her!
Come on, please.
Lori, I'll pick you up in 15 minutes.
Thanks, Dad.
Oh, what a guy.
Thanks, really.
You know, I have no time to get ready.
Be back by 10.
Oh, believe me,
I'll be back by 9 if I can.
No, no, no, um... make it 11...
Right. and, um, make sure you have a good time.
* She never looked
That good for me *
Whoo!
* I was so secure
* I didn't see it coming
* And she was
Halfway out the door *
* Before I started running
* They say that love is blind *
* I didn't see the signs
Let's go!
What are you doing?
It's only 9:30!
Haven't you heard enough?
These chords are all very similar.
Ow.
It's about... Oh.
You said any time.
Oh.
Here I am.
I've been wanting to do that all night.
Me too.
Mm
Sorry, I'm normally a bit taller.
Jack...
Yeah?
Oh, Jack.
What?
This is really very special.
And you... are really very special.
I don't want you to forget that.
No.
No.
You know, there is a magic between us.
It's a tenderness and sort of a childlike caring that I really need in my life.
Okay.
I'm learning something tonight, Jack.
I feel so free, so unchained, so able to feel a warm emotion without being compelled to perform some mindless act.
Am I right?
Because reality is so much better than fantasy.
I go around saying that all the--
Warmth is so much more valuable than heat...
My motto. because we could just go at it, Jack, and we will.
You know it, and I know it.
We can.
Yeah, we can, we--
Right now.
Right here, right now.Yeah, we can.
Just take off all our clothes and just go at it.
Oh, yeah?
We could just be like animals, rubbing and feeling and touching and kissing and sucking and eating...
Eating.
Screaming. for hours.
Let's just do it.
Do it, yeah.
Do it.
Yeah.
Do it.
Do it.
Do it.
That would be so darn easy, but rushing's never been our style.
Mm.
Ah.
Whew.
Jack...
Huh?
Oh.
Jack.
Yeah?
Jack...
How about a drink?
You got it.
A little music?
You bet.
Whoa.
Too loud, too loud.
It's a little bright, don't you think?
Too bright? Yeah, bright.
Yeah. Bright.
Yo!
Thank you.
Yo.
Whoa.
No problem. There we go.
Almost out.
Um...
Uh
It happens every so often.
Let me just... let's move this out of the way.
Give this a little push.
I'm uncomfortable,
Jack.
I'll have this out in a jiffy.
It's getting a little late.
It's early.
Pull up another chair.
The couch.
It's out.
Let me just get this fire completely out.
Uh, go ahead and help yourself to another beer.
I have beer at home.
Good night, Jack.
You're leaving?
JACK: See?
And you still have the shank of the evening to do with as you wish.
Ugh!
I want out of here!
Not nearly as much as I do.
You're ruining my life.
I have got the living shit beat out of me and it is your fault!
Oh, no, you've got the shit beat out of me!
You are screwing up my life, mister, and I can kiss that Chief of Staff job goodbye!
Oh!
I have had it with you, pal... and tomorrow morning, the woman from Northwestern has to interview me to get you into a medical program, and look how I look!
Why don't you leave me alone and let me lead my own life?
You've never let me lead my own life!
How can you lead your own life? You can't even lead my life.
Oh. Hi.
Uncle Earl.
You found Uncle Earl.
He's got the antidote.
Ah.
Oh, thank God.
Well, he doesn't exactly have the antidote with him...
Trigger... but he knows where it grows, so I guess we're going on... a little trip.
CHRIS: Earl, how close are we to this carrot root?
Tarot root.
How close?
Real close.
Real close?
How close?
Well, maybe not absolutely close.
Where, dammit?
Death Valley.
JACK: Is this tarot root?
EARL: No, that's piccoli cacti.
Tarot root is brown.
Oh. How about this one?
Nah. Sand rot.
Tarot root is, uh, tiny.
Hey, I think
I got something that's brown and tiny.
Aah!
That's curler snake.
Looks just like tarot root.
Earl, forget the fire.
Help us look for this root.
We need the fire.
We got some cooking to do.
You're going to mix this stuff out here?
You yabboes are in a hurry to get out of each other.
Yeah.
I do have that interview with Northwestern tomorrow.
You want to go back or not?
Yes.
You see how easy it is to let school slide.
Root.
Right.
Brown and tiny!
Brown and tiny!
Is this it?
Jackpot.
TRIGGER: Hey, great going, Chris.
Now, everybody squat.
Earl...
Squat, squat.
Ow!
I'm sorry, Earl.
I don't squat.
Squat.
Now, everybody settle.
This is just us and the desert.
Let all your worldly cares just blow away.
Let the wind just clean you out.
Earl, skip the mumbo jumbo.
Let's get to it.
This is it.
Well, I feel damn silly.
Well, we're all damn silly in the desert... and in the world, whether we know it or not or whether we like it or not.
Earl...
Okay. Here we go.
Cheers.
Sometimes it takes a while.
Mumbo-jumbo. Damn!
Shit!
What does "shit" mean, Earl?
It means they've put up some confusing signs on this highway.
Well, haven't we got any maps?
Sure.
Here.
Plenty.
Hey, there's a gas station or something.
Ah!
Great.
Great, Earl.
Anybody here?
Well, let's get back on the bus.
Excellent idea.
Somebody's in trouble.
It's one person in trouble, Earl.
Let's not make it a busful.
Doc, you'd better get in here.
It's the perfect time.
I kill him, you go to jail for it.
I think I'm gonna love it out here.
Doctor's coming.
We've got a doctor.
The lady's having a baby.
She's gonna be all right.
How long has she been in labor?
Aw, hell, I don't...
Two, three hours,
I guess. I don't know, but we need a doctor.
All right, now, get some towels and some fresh water,
Mr., uh...
Freemont. Thank you, kid, but I need a doctor.
You've got a doctor.
Who is this kid?
He's the doctor.
Oh, shit.
This is crazy.
Okay, Freemont, come here.
Help me hold her head.
Hold her head, Freemont.
Help me out here, please.
Ow, ow, ow!
There you go.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's all right.
It's okay.
Hang on, hang on.
A little young, aren't you?
Not as young as you think.
What's your name?
Corky.
Corky, is this your first?
I've got a son.
Good, I do too.
Got the water.
I got the water.
No towels.
Well, do you have any newspapers, then?
Nope. Nope.
There's, uh, some on the bus.
I got it. I got it.
I got it.
Ow.
All right, now, hold her head, Freemont.
Make her comfortable.
Everything is going just fine.
Push, Corky.
Push hard like you want this baby out of you and into this world.
That's it. Push.
I know it hurts.
TRIGGER:
Doc, I got 'em!
I got 'em, doc.
I got 'em.
Lifestyle section.
Bring 'em over.
Push.
Chris, come on.
That's it, that's it.
I said, come on, Chris.
Come on.
That's it, that's it, that's it.
Chris, come here.
Come on, Chris.
I want you to get around back of me and watch this. All right.
That's it.
Here it comes.
That's it.
That's it.
That's it.
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
All right, now, push, Corky.
That's it.
That's it, push.
Chris, Chris, look at this.
Damn, this is...
Push, push.
Damn, is this something or what? Chris...
Chris, can you see this?
That's it. Here it comes.
Here it comes.
I haven't done this in years, and it still gets me. Chris...
Chris... Um, Earl?
I'll take care of him.
There you go.
We've got a boy.
Oh. Oh.
You're gonna make one hell of a doctor when you grow up, boy.
You okay?
Yeah.
All right.
Hey, doc, what do you say we celebrate the kid's birthday and ditch school?
No, no. I've got
Chris' interview at 10:00.
We should just make that.
Good luck.
I'm going home.
No, you're not.
You are going to the hospital to make a very brief acceptance speech as the new
Chief of Staff... then you go home.
Chief of Staff of a major medical facility, grounded.
Oh, Dr. Armbruster. Larry.
God.
Hi, Jack.
Didn't mean to wake you.
No. No, you didn't.
No.
I was just, uh... catching up on a little shut-eye.
I had a rough night.
So I heard.
You heard?
I wanted to drop by and have a little chat with you before the board meets.
I want to give it to you straight.
I'm supporting someone else for Chief of Staff.
No, please.
Oh, God, please.
This isn't happening.
Larry!
Uh, Dr. Armbruster,
I mean, uh, you're making a terrible mistake.
My father...
He, uh...
I... I want this more than I can tell you.
I mean, it's the most important thing in my life.
I... I...
I mean, I...
I love medicine.
I love blood.
I really do!
Nobody's doubting your sincerity.
Hey, look...
I admire the way you said,
"Screw the insurance."
Please, you don't understand.
I mean, Chief of Staff. I...
It's what my father's worked for and slaved for.
It's all he has left.
I didn't realize your father was still alive.
He won't be for long.
This will kill him.
Oh, Jack, Jack.
No...
Buck up, Jack.
Jack, it's all right, now.
You're still my guy.
What? What is...
Come on down to the board room and we'll start the meeting.
What
JACK: Where would the Northwestern interview be?
Guidance office, second floor.
Hurry up, doc.
You're 15 minutes late.
Run, doc!
It's okay.
The guidance counselor's office?
End of the hall.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Uh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You... I can't tell you.
I'm terribly sorry.
Are you all right?
I... I was sliding.
I was out of control.
I'm Dr. Jack Hammond.
I'm late for an appointment.
I'm sorry.
Are you all right?
Hi, Jack. Janice Stenfield,
Northwestern University.
I just want to know one thing.
Now, what would ever possess you to fool around with my wife?
I did not screw your wife!
I was airborne.
I was out of control.
What?
Ah!
I'm back.
Oh, my God, I'm back!
Oh, I'm back, and I want to be a doctor!
This is me. It's me!
Yes, indeed!
Here I am, and I want to be a doctor!
I want to be a doctor!
I want to be a doc--
What?
What?
I... I want to be a doctor.
I want to be a doctor.
I... I want to...
Jack... Jack, you are a doctor.
Yes.
I... What?
I just found out that I'm not gonna be
Chief of Staff.
You're not even in medical school yet.
I don't want to be in medical school.
I want to be a doctor.
I mean, my father, he wants to be a doctor, but...
I am a doctor, for God's sake.
I am a doctor! I am a doctor!
It's Chris who doesn't want to be a doctor.
Holy shit,
I've gotta get out of here.
We still have a few minutes.
Hey, doc. Doc!
Trigger, Trigger, come on!
Hey, it's me.
It's me. It's Chris.
Chris, you're back.
Yeah. We got to get to the hospital.
Let's go.
There you are, you little chicken shit!
Lori left me.
You satisfied
Rick, I want to help you out here, but, man, I gotta go.
I'm gonna finish what I started last night.
Wait a minute.
You did this to me?
Yeah, and I'm gonna do it again too.
Look, Rick, man,
I don't want to fight--
Oh, you don't want to fight now, huh, Hammond?
I'll fight you with one hand behind my back.
Come on, man!
Oh, are you afraid, little boy?
Okay, I'll tell you what.
I'll fight you with two hands behind my back.
What do you say?
Two?
Two?
That one was for my dad.
Doc!
Trigger!
Doc!
Trigger, where's the car?
Where's my car,
Trigger?
Your dad brought the Jag.
Hurry up.
The Jag, right.
Run.

ARMBRUSTER:
Policy stands as amended.
All right, freeze everybody!
Hold it right where you are.
All right, now, what is this?
What the hell is this?
Just shut up, moose breath.
Would someone remove this boy?
I'm Jack Hammond's kid.
My Dad wants to be Chief of Staff more than anything... and if he hasn't been himself lately, it's...
Well, that's because he's had a lot on his mind.
He's been helping me with school and... and trying to get me into college, and I've kind of let him down, but my dad knows medicine.
I mean, he spends all his spare time here at this hospital, and he's always... always bringing home those... those boring medical magazines.
He doesn't do it because he has to.
He does it because he loves it, because he cares so much about...
He cares so much about his patients and his work.
He cares so much about me.
You guys have all seen him work. My dad is a great doctor.
You should have seen him out in the desert.
Under pressure, he was... he was so calm and cool.
He was so together, and for you to keep him from being Chief of Staff because of yesterday, well, that's not fair, because it wasn't his fault.
It wasn't even him. It was me.
God, I would love to explain this, but I can't. You wouldn't understand.
You've just got to take my word for it.
By the way, it... it wasn't my dad who was screwing around with your wife.
It was me.
Sid, read the name of the new Chief of Staff.
The new
Chief of Staff is...
Hal Gilden.
No, you... This is so wrong.
Didn't you hear me?
Didn't you hear what I said?
All right, you can leave.
You can get out.
Didn't you hear what I said?
You can't do this.
Get out!
Please, guys, you...
Dr. Armbruster,
I, uh...
I need to make a very public apology.
It won't change things.
I'm hoping it will, because I have been an ass.
I've been disrespectful to a very important person.
Well, and if
I'm forgiven,
I promise to make amends.
Um...
I've changed in... some ways and I...
I hope to change more.
ARMBRUSTER:
I'll have to think about that.
I'll really have to think about that.
Why?
This really has nothing to do with you.
Listen, Jack, about the Chief of Staff job...
Oh, you can shove the Chief of Staff job.
This is about me and my son.
Anything left on my credit card?
Enough to get us home.
Come on, let's go home.
Yeah. Oh, uh, sorry.
Uh, my son and I have some celebrating to do.
I'm celebrating being a doctor and my son is celebrating not.
I presume you drove my car.
You want to drive us home?
Uh...
I think
I'll grab a cab.
Dad, about your car...
What?
Well, you know, I was a very forgiving person... when I was your age.
Hey, guys.
Look what I brought.
Want another shot?
Trigger...
Trigger...
I'll throw it away.
Rick...
I have a little present for you.
Do you have insurance, son?
No, dickhead.

Hi, honey.
Hi, Mom.
You feeling any better?
A little bit.
Guess what?
What?
Your grandfather's here.
Mom, can't you tell him
I'm sick?
You're sick?
That's why he's here.
He'll pinch my cheek.
I hate that.
Maybe he won't.
Hey, how is the sickie? Huh?
I think I'll leave you two pals alone.
I brought you a special present.
What is it?
Open it up.
A book?
That's right.
When I was your age, television was called books.
And this is a special book.
It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father.
And today,
I'm gonna read it to you.
Has it got any sports in it?
Are you kidding?
Fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles.
Doesn't sound too bad.
I'll try and stay awake.
Well, thank you very much.
Very nice of you.
Your vote of confidence is overwhelming.
All right.
"The Princess Bride,
"by S. Morgenstern.
"Chapter one.
"Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin.
"Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse
"and tormenting the farm boy that worked there.
"His name was Westley, but she never called him that."
Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
Yeah, it's really good.
"Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley around."
Farm Boy, polish my horse's saddle.
I want to see my face shining in it by morning.
As you wish.
"'As you wish' was all he ever said to her."
Farm Boy, fill these with water.
Please?
As you wish.
"That day, she was amazed to discover
"that when he was saying,
'As you wish,'
"what he meant was,
'I love you.'
"And even more amazing was the day she realized she truly loved him back."
Farm Boy, fetch me that pitcher.
As you wish.
Hold it. Hold it.
What is this?
Are you trying to trick me?
Where's the sports?
Is this a kissing book?
Wait. Just wait.
When does it get good?
Keep your shirt on.
Let me read.
"Westley had no money for marriage,
"so he packed his few belongings and left the farm
"to seek his fortune across the sea.
"It was a very emotional time for Buttercup."
I don't believe this.
I fear I'll never see you again.
Of course you will.
But what if something happens to you?
Hear this now.
I will always come for you.
But how can you be sure?
This is true love.
Do you think this happens every day?
"Westley didn't reach his destination.
"His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts,
"who never left captives alive.
"When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered..."
Murdered by pirates is good.
"...she went into her room and shut the door.
"And for days, she neither slept nor ate."
I will never love again.
"Five years later, the main square of Florin City was filled as never before
"to hear the announcement of the great Prince
Humperdinck's bride-to-be."
My people, a month from now, our country will have its 500th anniversary.
On that sundown,
I shall marry a lady who was once a commoner like yourselves.
But perhaps you will not find her common now.
Would you like to meet her?
Yes!
My people, the Princess Buttercup!
"Buttercup's emptiness consumed her.
"Although the law of the land gave Humperdinck the right
"to choose his bride,
"she did not love him.
"Despite Humperdinck's reassurance that she would grow to love him,
"the only joy she found was in her daily ride."
A word, my lady?
We are but poor, lost circus performers.
Is there a village nearby?
There is nothing nearby, not for miles.
Then there will be no one to hear you scream.
What is that you're ripping?
It is fabric from the uniform of an army officer of Guilder.
Who is Guilder?
The country across the sea.
The sworn enemy of Florin.
Go! Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love.
When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed.
You never said anything about killing anyone.
I've hired you to help me start a war.
It's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
I just don't think it's right killing an innocent girl.
Am I going mad or did the word "think" escape your lips?
You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic landmass!
I agree with Fezzik.
The sot has spoken.
What happens to her is not truly your concern.
I will kill her.
And remember this.
Never forget this!
When I found you, you were so slobbering drunk you couldn't buy brandy!
And you!
Friendless. Brainless.
Helpless! Hopeless!
Do you want me to send you back to where you were?
Unemployed? In Greenland?
That Vizzini, he can fuss.
Fuss. Fuss.
I think he like to scream at us.
Probably he means no harm.
He's really very short on charm.
You have a great gift for rhyme.
Yes. Yes. Some other time.
Enough of that!
Fezzik, are there rocks ahead?
If there are, we'll all be dead.
No more rhymes now,
I mean it!
Anybody want a peanut?
We'll reach the cliffs by dawn.
Why are you doing that?
Are you sure nobody's follow us?
That would be inconceivable.
Despite what you think, you will be caught.
And when you are, the Prince will see you all hanged.
Of all the necks on this boat, Highness, the one you should be worrying about is your own.
Stop doing that!
We can all relax.
It's almost over.
You are sure nobody's follow us?
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally and in all other ways inconceivable.
No one in Guilder knows what we've done and no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast.
Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
No reason.
Suddenly, I just happen to look behind us and something is there.
What?
Probably some local fisherman out for a pleasure cruise at night through eel-infested waters.
What? Go in! Get after her!
I don't swim.
I only dog paddle.
Veer left!
Left! Left!
Do you know what that sound is, Highness?
Those are the shrieking eels!
If you don't believe me, just wait.
They always grow louder when they're about to feed on human flesh!
If you swim back now,
I promise no harm will come to you.
I doubt you'll get such an offer from the eels.
She doesn't get eaten by the eels at this time.
What?
The eel doesn't get her.
I'm explaining to you because you look nervous.
I wasn't nervous.
Maybe I was a little bit concerned, but that's not the same thing.
Because we can stop now if you want.
No, you could read a little bit more if you want.
"Do you know what that sound is, Highness?
"Those are the shrieking eels."
We're past that, Grandpa.
You read it already.
Oh. Oh, my goodness.
I did. I'm sorry.
I beg your pardon.
All right. All right.
Let's see, she was in the water.
The eel was coming after her.
She was frightened.
The eel started to charge her, and then...
Put her down.
Just put her down.
I think he's getting closer.
He's no concern of ours.
Sail on!
I suppose you think you're brave, don't you?
Only compared to some.
Look!
He's right on top of us!
I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
Whoever he is, he's too late. See?
The Cliffs of Insanity!
Hurry up! Move the thing!
And that other thing!
Move it!
We're safe. Only Fezzik is strong enough to go up our way.
He'll have to sail around for hours till he finds a harbor.
He's climbing the rope and he's gaining on us.
Inconceivable.
Faster!
I thought
I was going faster.
You were supposed to be this colossus.
You were this great legendary thing.
And yet, he gains!
Well,
I'm carrying three people, and he got only himself.
I do not accept excuses.
I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
Don't say that, Vizzini.
Please?
Did I make it clear that your job is at stake?
He's got very good arms.
He didn't fall?
Inconceivable.
You keep using that word.
I do not think it means what you think it means.
My God. He's climbing.
Whoever he is, he's obviously seen us with the Princess and must, therefore, die.
You, carry her.
We'll head straight for the Guilder frontier.
Catch up when he's dead.
If he falls, fine.
If not, the sword.
I'm going to duel him left-handed.
You know what a hurry we're in!
It's the only way
I can be satisfied.
If I use my right, over too quickly.
Oh, have it your way.
You be careful.
People in masks cannot be trusted.
I'm waiting!
Hello there!
Slow going?
Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks, so I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
Sorry.
Thank you.
I don't suppose you could speed things up?
If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope or a tree branch, or find something useful to do.
I could do that.
I've got some rope up here.
But I do not think you would accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.
That does put a damper on our relationship.
But I promise
I will not kill you until you reach the top.
That's very comforting, but I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
I hate waiting.
I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
No good.
I've known too many Spaniards.
Is there any way you'll trust me?
Nothing comes to mind.
I swear on the soul of my father,
Domingo Montoya, you will reach the top alive.
Throw me the rope.
Thank you.
We'll wait... wait... wait until you're ready.
Again, thank you.
I do not mean to pry, but you don't by any chance happen to have six fingers on your right hand?
Do you always begin conversations this way?
My father was slaughtered by a six-fingered man.
He was a great sword maker, my father.
When the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job.
He slaved a year before he was done.
I've never seen its equal.
The six-fingered man returned and demanded it, but at one-tenth his promised price.
My father refused.
Without a word, the six-fingered man slashed him through the heart.
I loved my father.
So, naturally, I challenged his murderer to a duel.
I failed.
The six-fingered man leave me alive.
But he gave me this.
How old were you?
I was 11 years old.
When I was strong enough,
I dedicated my life to the study of fencing.
So, the next time we meet,
I will not fail.
I will go up to the six-fingered man and say,
"Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya.
"You killed my father.
Prepare to die."
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
More pursue it than study, lately.
You see,
I cannot find him.
It has been 20 years now.
I'm starting to lose confidence.
I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills.
There's not a lot of money in revenge.
Well, I certainly hope you find him someday.
You're ready then?
Whether I am or not, you've been more than fair.
You seem a decent fellow.
I hate to kill you.
You seem a decent fellow.
I hate to die.
Begin.
You are using
Bonetti's defense against me, huh?
I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain.
Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.
Naturally. But I find that Thibault cancels out
Capo Ferro, don't you?
Unless the enemy has studied his Agrippa.
Which I have!
You are wonderful.
Thank you.
I've worked hard to become so.
I admit that you are better than I am.
Then why are you smiling?
Because I know something you don't know.
And what is that?
I am not left-handed.
You are amazing.
I ought to be, after 20 years.
There's something
I ought to tell you.
Tell me.
I'm not left-handed either.
Who are you?
No one of consequence.
I must know.
Get used to disappointment.
Okay.
Kill me quickly.
I would as soon destroy a stained-glass window as an artist like yourself.
However, since I can't have you following me, either...
Please understand, I hold you in the highest respect.
Inconceivable!
Give her to me.
Catch up with us quickly.
What do I do?
Finish him.
Finish him your way!
Oh, good. My way.
Thank you, Vizzini.
Which one's my way?
Pick up one of those rocks.
Get behind the boulder.
In a few minutes, the man in black will come running around the bend.
The minute his head is in view, hit it with the rock!
My way's not very sportsmanlike.
I did that on purpose.
I didn't have to miss.
I believe you.
So what happens now?
We face each other as God intended.
Sportsmanlike.
No tricks. No weapons.
Skill against skill alone.
You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try and kill each other like civilized people?
I can kill you now.
Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand-fighting.
It's not my fault for being the biggest and the strongest.
I don't even exercise.
Look, are you just fiddling around with me, or what?
I just want you to feel you're doing well.
I hate for people to die embarrassed.
You're quick.
And a good thing, too.
Why are you wearing a mask?
Were you burned by acid or something like that?
No, it's just that they're terribly comfortable.
I think everyone will be wearing them in the future.
I just figured why you give me so much trouble.
Why's that, do you think?
Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long.
I've been specializing in groups, battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
Why should that make such a... difference?
Well, you see, you use different moves
When you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
I do not envy you the headache you will have when you awake.
But in the meantime, rest well and dream of large women.
There was a mighty duel.
It ranged all over.
They were both masters.
Who won? How did it end?
The loser ran off alone, but the winner followed those footprints toward Guilder.
Shall we track them both?
The loser is nothing.
Only the Princess matters.
Clearly, this was all planned by warriors of Guilder.
We must all be ready for whatever lies ahead.
Could this be a trap?
I always think everything could be a trap, which is why I'm still alive.
So, it is down to you and it is down to me.
If you wish her dead, by all means, keep moving forward.
Let me explain.
There's nothing to explain.
You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen.
Perhaps an arrangement can be reached?
There will be no arrangement, and you're killing her.
Well, if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.
I'm afraid so. I can't compete with you physically, and you're no match for my brains.
You're that smart?
Let me put it this way.
Have you ever heard of Plato,
Aristotle, Socrates?
Yes.
Morons.
Really?
In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.
For the Princess?
To the death?
I accept.
Good, then pour the wine.
Inhale this, but do not touch.
I smell nothing.
What you do not smell is called iocane powder.
It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadly poisons known to man.
Hmm.
All right.
Where is the poison?
The battle of wits has begun.
It ends when you decide, and we both drink and find out who is right and who is dead.
But it's so simple.
All I have to do is divine from what I know of you.
Are you the sort of man who would put the poison into his own goblet or his enemy's?
Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given.
I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
But you must have known
I was not a great fool.
You would've counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
You've made your decision, then?
Not remotely.
Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows, and Australia is entirely peopled with criminals, and criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
Wait till I get going.
Where was I?
Australia.
Yes. Australia.
And you must have suspected
I would have known the powder's origin, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
You're just stalling now.
You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?
You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong, so you could've put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
But you've also bested my Spaniard, which means you must've studied, and in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal, so you would've put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
You're trying to trick me into giving away something.
It won't work.
It has worked!
You've given everything away.
I know where the poison is.
Then make your choice.
I will, and I choose...
What in the world can that be?
What? Where?
I don't see anything.
I could've sworn
I saw something.
No matter.
What's so funny?
I'll tell you in a minute.
First, let's drink, me from my glass and you from yours.
You guessed wrong.
You only think
I guessed wrong.
That's what's so funny.
I switched glasses while your back was turned!
You fool, you fell victim to one of the classic blunders.
The most famous is never get involved in a land war in Asia, but only slightly less well known is this.
Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line!
Who are you?
I'm no one to be trifled with.
That is all you ever need know.
To think, all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.
They were both poisoned.
I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.
Someone has beaten a giant.
There will be great suffering in Guilder if she dies.
Catch your breath.
If you'll release me, whatever you ask for ransom, you'll get it, I promise you.
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman?
You're very funny, Highness.
I was giving you a chance.
It does not matter where you take me.
There's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck.
He can track a falcon on a cloudy day.
He can find you.
You think your dearest love will save you?
I never said he was my dearest love, and yes, he will save me.
That I know.
You admit to me you do not love your fiancé?
He knows I do not love him.
Are not capable of love, is what you mean.
I have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream.
That was a warning,
Highness.
The next time, my hand flies on its own, for where I come from, there are penalties when a woman lies.
Iocane. I'd bet my life on it.
And there are the Princess's footprints.
She is alive, or was, an hour ago.
If she is otherwise when I find her,
I shall be very put out.
Rest, Highness.
I know who you are.
Your cruelty reveals everything.
You're the
Dread Pirate Roberts.
Admit it.
With pride.
What can I do for you?
You can die slowly, cut into a thousand pieces.
Hardly complimentary,
Your Highness.
Why loose your venom on me?
You killed my love.
It's possible.
I kill a lot of people.
Who was this love of yours?
Another prince like this one?
Ugly, rich and scabby?
No, a farm boy. Poor.
Poor and perfect.
With eyes like the sea after a storm.
On the high seas your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.
I can't afford to make exceptions.
I mean, once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work all the time.
You mock my pain!
Life is pain, Highness.
Anyone who says differently is selling something.
I remember this farm boy of yours, I think.
This would be what?
Five years ago?
Does it bother you to hear?
Nothing you can say will upset me.
He died well.
That should please you.
No bribe attempts or blubbering.
He simply said,
"Please. Please,
I need to live."
It was the "please" that caught my memory.
I asked him what was so important for him.
"True love," he replied.
And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness.
I can only assume he meant you.
You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are.
And what am I?
Faithfulness he talked of, madam.
Your enduring faithfulness.
Now tell me truly.
When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
You mocked me once.
Never do it again!
I died that day!
You can die, too, for all I care!
As you wish!
Oh, my sweet Westley!
What have I done?
Disappeared.
He must have seen us closing in.
Which might account for his panicking into error.
Unless I am wrong, and I am never wrong, they are headed dead into the Fire Swamp.
Can you move at all?
Move? You're alive.
If you want, I can fly.
I told you I would always come for you.
Why didn't you wait for me?
Well, you were dead.
Death cannot stop true love.
All it can do is delay it for a while.
I will never doubt again.
There will never be a need.
Oh, no, no, please.
What is it?
What's the matter?
They're kissing again.
Do we have to hear the kissing part?
Someday, you may not mind so much.
Skip on to the Fire Swamp.
That sounded good.
Oh.
You're sick.
I'll humor you.
So, now, where were we here?
Oh, okay.
"Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor."
Ha! Your pig fiancé is too late.
A few more steps and we'll be safe in the Fire Swamp.
We'll never survive.
Nonsense.
You're only saying that because no one ever has.
It's not that bad.
I'm not saying
I'd like to build a summer home here, but the trees are actually quite lovely.
Well, now, that was an adventure.
Singed a bit, were you?
You?
Well, one thing I will say, the Fire Swamp certainly does keep you on your toes.
This will all soon be but a happy memory, because Roberts' ship,
Revenge, is anchored at the far end, and I, as you know, am Roberts.
But how is that possible, since he's been marauding 20 years and you only left me five years ago?
I, myself, am often surprised at life's little quirks.
See, what I told you before about saying
"please" was true.
It intrigued Roberts, as did my description of your beauty.
Finally Roberts decided something.
He said, "All right, Westley.
"I've never had a valet.
You can try it for tonight.
"I'll most likely kill you in the morning."
Three years, he said that.
"Good night, Westley.
Good work.
"Sleep well.
I'll most likely kill you in the morning."
It was a fine time for me.
I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me.
And Roberts and I eventually became friends.
And then it happened.
What? Go on.
Roberts had grown so rich he wanted to retire, so he took me to his cabin and told me a secret.
"I am not the Dread
Pirate Roberts," he said.
"My name is Ryan.
"I inherited the ship from the previous
Dread Pirate Roberts,
"just as you will inherit it from me.
"The man I inherited it from was not the real
Dread Pirate Roberts either.
"His name was Cummerbund.
The real Roberts has been retired 15 years
"and living like a king in Patagonia." Thank you.
Then he explained the name was the important thing for inspiring the necessary fear.
You see, no one would surrender to the Dread Pirate Westley.
So, we sailed ashore, took on an entirely new crew, and he stayed aboard for a while, as first mate, all the time calling me Roberts.
Once the crew believed, he left the ship, and I have been Roberts ever since.
Except, now that we're together,
I shall retire and hand the name over to someone else.
Is everything clear to you?
We'll never succeed.
We may as well die here.
No. No.
We have already succeeded.
I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp?
One, the flame spurt.
No problem.
There's a popping sound preceding each.
We can avoid that.
Two, the lightning sand, but you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future, we can avoid that, too.
Westley, what about the R.O. U.S. S?
Rodents of Unusual Size?
I don't think they exist.
Westley!
We did it.
Now, was that so terrible?
Surrender.
You mean, you wish to surrender to me?
Very well. I accept.
I give you full marks for bravery.
Don't make yourself a fool.
But how will you capture us?
We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp.
We can live there quite happily for some time, so whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
I tell you once again, surrender!
It will not happen.
For the last time, surrender!
Death first!
Will you promise not to hurt him?
What was that?
If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
He is a sailor on the pirate ship Revenge.
Promise to return him to his ship.
I swear it will be done.
Once we are out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.
I swear it will be done.
I thought you were dead once, and it almost destroyed me.
I could not bear it if you died again, not when I could save you.
Come, sir.
We must get you to your ship.
We are men of action.
Lies do not become us.
Well spoken, sir.
What is it?
You have six fingers on your right hand.
Someone was looking for you.
Where am I?
The Pit of Despair.
Don't even think...
Don't even think about trying to escape.
The chains are far too thick.
And don't dream of being rescued either.
The only way in is secret.
Only the Prince, the Count and I know how to get in and out.
Then I'm here till I die?
Till they kill you, yeah.
Then why bother curing me?
The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
So, it's to be torture?
I can cope with torture.
You don't believe me?
You survived the Fire Swamp.
You must be very brave.
But nobody withstands the machine.
She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.
It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
Of course.
"The King died that very night,
"and before the following dawn,
"Buttercup and Humperdinck were married.
"And at noon, she met her subjects again, this time as their queen."
My father's final words were...
Hold it. Hold it, Grandpa.
You read that wrong.
She doesn't marry Humperdinck.
She marries Westley.
I'm just sure of it.
After all that Westley did for her, if she didn't marry him, it wouldn't be fair.
Well, who says life is fair?
Where is that written?
Life isn't always fair.
I'm telling you, you're messing up the story.
Now, get it right!
Do you want me to go on with this?
Yes.
All right then.
No more interruptions.
"At noon, she met her subjects again, this time as their queen."
My father's final words were,
"Love her as I loved her,
"and there will be joy."
I present to you your queen,
Queen Buttercup.
Boo!
Boo!
Why do you do this?
Because you had love in your hands and you gave it up!
But they would've killed Westley if I hadn't done it.
Your true love lives, and you marry another!
True love saved her in the Fire Swamp and she treated it like garbage.
And that's what she is, the queen of refuse!
So bow down to her if you want, bow to her.
Bow to the queen of slime, the queen of filth, the queen of putrescence!
Boo! Boo!
Rubbish! Filth! Slime!
Muck! Boo! Boo!
Boo!
"It was 10 days till the wedding.
"The King still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse."
See?
Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
Yes, you're very smart.
Shut up.
It comes to this.
I love Westley.
I always have.
I know now,
I always will.
If you tell me
I must marry you in 10 days, please believe
I will be dead by morning.
I could never cause you grief.
Consider our wedding off.
You, uh, returned this Westley to his ship?
Yes.
Then we will simply alert him.
Beloved, are you certain he still wants you?
After all, it was you who did the leaving in the Fire Swamp.
Not to mention that, uh, pirates are not known to be men of their words.
My Westley will always come for me.
Uh...
I suggest a deal.
You write four copies of a letter.
I'll send my four fastest ships, one in each direction.
The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year.
We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message.
If Westley wants you, bless you both.
If not, please consider me as an alternative to suicide.
Are we agreed?
Your princess is really quite a winning creature.
A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.
I know. The people are quite taken with her.
It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day,
I thought that was clever.
But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night.
Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged.
They'll demand we go to war.
Now, where is that secret knot?
It's impossible to find.
Ah!
Are you coming down into the pit?
Westley's got his strength back.
I'm starting him on the machine tonight.
Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work.
But I've got my country's
500th anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, my wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it.
I'm swamped.
Get some rest.
If you haven't got your health, you haven't got anything.
Beautiful, isn't it?
Took me half a lifetime to invent it.
I'm sure you've discovered my deep and abiding interest in pain.
At present, I'm writing the definitive work on the subject.
So, I want you to be totally honest with me on how the machine makes you feel.
This being our first try,
I'll use the lowest setting.
As you know, the concept of the suction pump is centuries old.
Really, that's all this is, except that instead of sucking water,
I'm sucking life.
I've just sucked one year of your life away.
I might one day go as high as five, but I really don't know what that would do to you.
So, let's just start with what we have.
What did this do to you?
Tell me.
And remember, this is for posterity, so be honest.
How do you feel?
Interesting.
Yellin.
Sire.
As Chief Enforcer of all Florin,
I trust you with this secret.
Killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
My spy network has heard no such news.
Any word from Westley?
Too soon, my ángel.
Patience.
He will come for me.
Of course.
She will not be murdered!
On the day of the wedding,
I want the Thieves' Forest emptied, and every inhabitant arrested.
Many of the thieves will resist.
My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
Form a Brute Squad, then!
I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
It won't be easy, sire.
Try ruling the world sometime.
"The day of the wedding arrived.
"The Brute Squad had their hands full carrying out
Humperdinck's orders."
Is everybody out?
Almost.
There's a Spaniard giving us some trouble.
Well, you give him some trouble.
Move.
I am waiting for you, Vizzini.
You told me to go back to the beginning, so I have.
This is where I am and this is where I'll stay.
I will not be moved.
Ho, there!
I do not budge.
Keep your "Ho, there."
But the Prince gave orders.
So did Vizzini.
When a job went wrong, you went back to the beginning.
Well, this is where we got the job, so it's the beginning.
And I am staying till Vizzini comes.
You, Brute, come here!
I am waiting for Vizzini.
You surely are a meanie.
Hello.
It's you.
True.
You don't look so good.
You don't smell so good either.
Perhaps not.
I feel fine.
"Fezzik and Inigo were reunited.
"And as Fezzik nursed his inebriated friend back to health,
"he told Inigo of Vizzini's death
"and the existence of Count Rugen,
"the six-fingered man.
"Considering Inigo's life-long search,
"he handled the news surprisingly well.
"Fezzik took great care in reviving Inigo."
That's enough!
That's enough!
Where is this Rugen now, so I may kill him?
He's with the Prince in the castle.
But the castle gate is guarded by 30 men.
How many could you handle?
I don't think more than 10.
Leaving 20 for me.
At my best, I could never defeat that many.
I need Vizzini to plan.
I have no gift for strategy.
But Vizzini is dead.
No. Not Vizzini.
I need the man in black.
What?
Look. He bested you with strength, your greatness.
He bested me with steel.
He must have outthought Vizzini.
And a man who can do that can plan my castle onslaught any day.
Let's go.
Where?
Find the man in black, obviously.
But you don't know where he is.
Don't bother me with trifles.
After 20 years, at last my father's soul will be at peace.
There will be blood tonight!
Rise and report.
The Thieves' Forest is emptied.
Thirty men guard the castle gate.
Double it.
My princess must be safe.
The gate has but one key.
And I carry that.
Ah! My dulcet darling.
Tonight, we marry.
Tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to Florin Channel, where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon.
Every ship but your four fastest, you mean.
Every ship but the four you sent.
Yes. Yes, of course.
Naturally, not those four.
Your Majesty.
You never sent the ships.
Don't bother lying.
It doesn't matter.
Westley will come for me anyway.
You're a silly girl.
Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you are nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
I would not say such things if I were you.
Why not? You can't hurt me.
Westley and I are joined by the bonds of love.
And you cannot track that, not with a thousand bloodhounds.
And you cannot break it, not with a thousand swords.
And when I say you're a coward, that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth!
I would not say such things if I were you!
You truly love each other, and so you might have been truly happy.
Not one couple in a century has that chance, no matter what the storybooks say.
And so,
I think no man in a century will suffer as greatly as you will.
Not to 50!
Fezzik. Fezzik, listen.
Do you hear?
That is the sound of ultimate suffering.
My heart made that sound when Rugen slaughtered my father.
The man in black makes it now.
The man in black?
His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has the cause for ultimate suffering?
Excuse me. Pardon me, it's important.
Fezzik, please.
Everybody, move!
Thank you.
Where is the man in black?
You get there from this grove, yes?
Fezzik, jog his memory.
I'm sorry, Inigo.
I didn't meant to jog him so hard.
Inigo?
Father, I have failed you for 20 years.
Now, our misery can end.
Somewhere...
Somewhere close by is a man who can help us.
I cannot find him alone.
I need you.
I need you to guide my sword.
Please.
Guide my sword.
He's dead.
Just is not fair.
Grandpa, Grandpa, wait. Wait.
What did Fezzik mean,
"He's dead"?
I mean, he didn't mean "dead."
Westley's only faking, right?
You want me to read this or not?
Who gets Humperdinck?
I don't understand.
Who kills Prince Humperdinck?
At the end?
Somebody's gotta do it.
Is it Inigo? Who?
Nobody. Nobody kills him.
He lives.
You mean, he wins?
Jesus, Grandpa, what did you read me this thing for?
You know, you've been very sick and you're taking this story very seriously.
I think we ought to stop now.
No, I'm okay. I'm okay.
Sit down. I'm all right.
Okay.
All right, now, let's see.
Where were we?
Oh, yes.
In the Pit of Despair.
Well...
The Montoyas have never taken defeat easily.
Come along, Fezzik.
Bring the body.
The body?
Have you any money?
I have a little.
I just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all.
Go away!
What? What?
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
The King's stinking son fired me, and thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject.
While you're at it, why don't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it?
We're closed!
Beat it, or I'll call the Brute Squad.
I'm on the Brute Squad.
You are the Brute Squad.
We need a miracle.
It's very important.
Look, I'm retired.
And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired?
I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.
He's already dead.
He is, huh? I'll take a look.
Bring him in.
I've seen worse.
Sir?
Sir?
Huh?
We're in a terrible rush.
Don't rush me, sonny.
You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles.
You got money?
Sixty-five.
I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause.
This is noble, sir.
His wife is crippled.
His children are on the brink of starvation.
Are you a rotten liar.
I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these 20 years.
Your first story was better.
Where's that bellows cranny?
He probably owes you money, huh?
Well, I'll ask him.
He's dead. He can't talk.
Look who knows so much, huh.
Well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead.
There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead.
Please, open his mouth.
Now, mostly dead is slightly alive.
Now, all dead...
Well, with all dead, there's usually only one thing that you can do.
What's that?
Go through his clothes and look for loose change.
Hey!
Hello in there! Hey!
What's so important?
What you got here that's worth living for?
True love.
True love. You heard him.
You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.
Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world, except for a nice M.L.T.
A mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich when the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe.
They're so perky. I love that.
But that's not what he said.
He distinctly said,
"To blave."
And as we all know,
"to blave" means "to bluff."
Huh?
So you're probably playing cards and he cheated...
Liar! Liar!
Liar!
Get back, witch!
I'm not a witch,
I'm your wife!
But after what you just said,
I'm not even sure
I want to be that anymore.
You never had it so good.
"True love."
He said "true love," Max.
Don't say another word,
Valerie.
He's afraid. Ever since
Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
Why'd you say that name?
You promised me that you'd never say that name!
What, Humperdinck?
Humperdinck! Humperdinck!
Humperdinck!
Humperdinck! Humperdinck!
I'm not listening!
True love lies expiring,
And you don't have the decency to say why you won't help.
Nobody's hearing nothing.
Humperdinck! Humperdinck!
This is Buttercup's true love.
If you heal him, he will stop Humperdinck's wedding.
Humperdinck!
Wait, wait.
I make him better,
Humperdinck suffers?
Humiliations galore.
That is a noble cause.
Give me the 65.
I'm on the job.
That's a miracle pill?
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier.
But you have to wait
15 minutes for full potency.
And you shouldn't go in swimming after for at least...
What?
An hour. A good hour.
Yeah, an hour.
Thank you for everything.
Okay.
Bye-bye, boys.
Have fun storming the castle.
Think it'll work?
It would take a miracle.
Bye-bye!
Bye!
Inigo, there's more than 30.
What's the difference?
We've got him. Help me here.
We'll have to force-feed him.
Has it been 15 minutes?
We can't wait.
The wedding's in half an hour.
We must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.
Tilt his head back.
Open his mouth.
How long do we have to wait before if we know if the miracle works?
Your guess is as good as mine.
I'll beat you at your part.
I'll take you both together!
I guess not very long.
Why won't my arms move?
You've been mostly dead all day.
We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.
Who are you?
Are we enemies?
Why am I on this wall?
Where is Buttercup?
Let me explain.
No, there is too much.
Let me sum up.
Buttercup is marrying
Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the princess, make our escape.
After I kill Count Rugen.
That doesn't leave much time for dilly-dallying.
You just wiggled your finger.
That's wonderful.
I've always been a quick healer.
What are our liabilities?
There is but one working castle gate.
Come on.
And it is guarded by 60 men.
And our assets?
Your brains,
Fezzik's strength, my steel.
That's it? Lmpossible.
If I had a month to plan, maybe I could come up with something, but this...
You just shook your head.
That doesn't make you happy?
My brains, his steel and your strength against 60 men, and you think a little head jiggle is supposed to make me happy? Hmm?
If we only had a wheelbarrow, that would be something.
Where did we put the wheelbarrow the albino had?
Over the albino, I think.
Why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place?
What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.
There, we cannot help you.
Will this do?
Where did you get that?
At Miracle Max's.
It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.
All right, all right.
Come on. Help me up.
Now, I'll need a sword, eventually.
Why?
You can't even lift one.
True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?
Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
I'll say.
How do I find the Count?
Once I do, how do I find you again?
Once I find you again, how do we escape?
Don't pester him.
He's had a hard day.
Right. Right. Sorry.
Inigo.
What?
I hope we win.
You don't seem excited, my little muffin.
Should I be?
Brides often are,
I'm told.
I do not marry tonight.
My Westley will save me.
Marriage.
Marriage is what brings us together today.
Marriage, that blessed arrangement, that dream within a dream.
Stand your ground, men!
Stand your ground!
Stand your ground!
I am the Dread Pirate Roberts!
There will be no survivors!
Now?
Not yet.
My men are here, I am here, but soon you will not be here.
Now!
Light him.
The Dread Pirate Roberts takes no survivors.
All your worst nightmares are about to come true!
Then love, true love, will follow you forever.
The Dread Pirate Roberts
Is here for your souls!
Stay where you are!
Stand and fight.
Stay where you are!
So treasure your love...
Skip to the end.
Have you the ring?
Here comes my Westley now.
Fezzik, the portcullis!
Your Westley is dead.
I killed him myself.
Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
Give us the gate key.
I have no gate key.
Fezzik, tear his arms off.
Oh, you mean this gate key.
And do you,
Princess Buttercup...
Man and wife!
Say, "Man and wife!"
Man and wife.
Escort the bride to the honeymoon suite.
I'll be there shortly.
He didn't come.
Kill the dark one and the giant, but leave the third for questioning.
Hello.
My name is Inigo Montoya.
You killed my father.
Prepare to die.
Fezzik! I need you!
I can't leave him alone.
He's getting away from me,
Fezzik! Please!
Fezzik!
I'll be right back.
Thank you.
Strange wedding.
Yes, a very strange wedding.
Come along.
What was that for?
Because you've always been so kind to me.
And I won't be seeing you again, since I'm killing myself once we reach the honeymoon suite.
Won't that be nice?
She kissed me!
Sorry, Father.
I tried.
You must be that little Spanish brat
I taught a lesson to all those years ago.
Simply incredible.
Have you been chasing me your whole life, only to fail now?
I think that's the worst thing
I've ever heard.
How marvelous.
There's a shortage of perfect breasts in this world.
It would be a pity to damage yours.
Westley!
Oh, Westley, darling!
Westley, why won't you hold me?
Gently.
At a time like this?
That's all you can think to say? "Gently"?
Gently!
Good heavens.
Are you still trying to win?
You've got an overdeveloped sense of vengeance.
It's going to get you into trouble someday.
Hello.
My name is Inigo Montoya.
You killed my father.
Prepare to die.
Hello.
My name is Inigo Montoya.
You killed my father.
Prepare to die.
Hello!
My name is Inigo Montoya.
You killed my father.
Prepare to die.
Stop saying that!
Hello!
My name is Inigo Montoya!
You killed my father!
Prepare to die.
No!
Offer me money.
Yes.
Power, too.
Promise me that.
All that I have and more.
Please.
Offer me everything I ask for.
Anything you want.
I want my father back, you son of a bitch.
Westley, will you ever forgive me?
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
I got married.
I didn't want to.
It all happened so fast.
It never happened.
What?
It never happened.
But it did. I was there.
This old man said,
"Man and wife."
Did you say, "I do"?
No. We sort of skipped that part.
Then you're not married.
If you didn't say it, you didn't do it.
Wouldn't you agree,
Your Highness?
A technicality that will shortly be remedied.
But first things first.
To the death.
No!
To the pain.
I don't think
I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
I'll explain.
And I'll use small words, so that you'll be sure to understand, you warthog-faced buffoon.
That may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me.
It won't be the last.
"To the pain" means the first thing you lose will be your feet, below the ankles.
Then your hands at the wrists.
Next, your nose.
And then my tongue, I suppose?
I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.
I wasn't finished!
The next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right.
And then my ears.
I understand.
Let's get on with it.
Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why.
So that every shriek of every child at seeing your hideousness will be yours to cherish.
Every babe that weeps at your approach, every woman who cries out,
"Dear, God, what is that thing?"
Will echo in your perfect ears.
That is what
"to the pain" means.
It means I leave you in anguish, wallowing in freakish misery forever.
I think you're bluffing.
It's possible, pig.
I might be bluffing.
It's conceivable, you miserable, vomitous mass, that I'm only lying here because I lack the strength to stand.
Then again, perhaps I have the strength after all.
Drop your sword.
Have a seat.
Tie him up.
Make it as tight as you like.
Oh.
Where's Fezzik?
I thought he was with you.
No.
In that case...
Help him.
Why does Westley need helping?
Because he has no strength.
I knew it.
I knew you were bluffing!
I knew he was bluffing.
Shall I dispatch him for you?
Thank you, but no.
Whatever happens to us,
I want him to live a long life, alone with his cowardice.
Inigo!
Inigo, where are you?
Oh, there you are.
Inigo, I saw the prince's stables.
And there they were.
Four white horses.
And I thought,
"There are four of us, if we ever find the lady."
Hello, lady.
So I took them with me, in case we ever bumped into each other.
I guess we just did.
Fezzik, you did something right.
Don't worry,
I won't let it go to my head.
You know, it's very strange.
I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over,
I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.
Have you ever considered piracy?
You'd make a wonderful
Dread Pirate Roberts.
"They rode to freedom.
"And as dawn arose,
Westley and Buttercup knew they were safe.
"A wave of love swept over them,
"and as they reached for each other..."
What? What?
No, it's kissing again.
You don't want to hear that.
I... I don't mind so much.
Okay.
"Since the invention of the kiss, there have been five kisses
"that were rated the most passionate, the most pure.
"This one left them all behind.
"The end."
Now, I think you ought to go to sleep.
Okay.
All right.
So long.
Grandpa?
Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
As you wish.
Come my love
I'll tell you a tale
Of a boy and girl and their love story
And how he loved her
Oh, so much
And all the charms she did possess
Now this did happen once upon a time
When things were not so complex
And how he worshipped the ground she walked
And when he looked in her eyes
He became obsessed
My love is like a storybook story
But it's as real as the feelings I feel
My love is like a storybook story
But it's as real as the feelings I feel
It's as real as the feelings I feel
He said, "Don't you know
I love you, oh, so much
"And lay my heart at the foot of your dress?"
She said, "Don't you know that storybook loves
"Always have a happy ending?"
Then he swooped her up just like in the books
And on his stallion they rode away
My love is like a storybook story
But it's as real as the feelings I feel
My love is like a storybook story
But it's as real as the feelings I feel
Mommy's going to the beauty parlor, darling.
But I'm leaving you with your favorite friend, Roger.
He is going to take very, very good care of you.
Because if he doesn't, he's going back to the science lab!
P-p-please, don't worry.
Whatever you say.
Yes, ma'am. Aye, aye, sir. Okeydokey.
Why, I'll take care of him like he was my own brother.
Or my own sister.
Or my brother's sister.
Or my second cousin
- who is twice removed.
- Gobble. Cookie.
Or my ninth cousin, who is nine times removed from his place outside.
Or like my 15th cousin, who is 16 times removed from my mother's side.
Or like my 27th cousin, who is 37 times...
- Cookie.
- ...removed from my father's side.
Like my 17th cousin, who is
156 times removed from any side!
I'll save you, Baby!
Cookie.
Don't burn yourself,
Baby Herman.
Who turned out the lights?
It's dark in here.
Don't they pay their electricity?
What's happened?
I'll find you, Baby. Where are you?
- Where are you?
- Cookie.
Where'd you go?
What's that smoke?
Cookie.
Cookie.
I'm here, Baby...
Cookie.
Cookie.
- Cut!
- All right. That's it, guys.
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut!
What the hell was wrong with that take?
Nothing with you, Baby Herman.
You were great. You were perfect.
You were better than perfect.
It's Roger! He keeps blowing his lines!
- Roger, what's this?
- A tweeting bird?
"A tweeting bird?" Roger, read the script. Look what it says!
It says, "Rabbit gets clunked, rabbit sees stars."
Not birds, stars!
Can we lose the playback, please?
- Roger, you're killing me! Killing me!
- Cut the playback!
For cryin' out loud, Roger!
How many times do we have to do this damn scene?
Raoul, I'll be in my trailer, takin' a nap!
Excuse me, toots.
My stomach can't take this.
This set is a mess.
Clean this set up! And get him out of there, or seal him up in it!
- Lose the lights! And say "lunch"!
- Lunch!
That's lunch. We're on a half.
P-please, Raoul. I can give you stars!
Just drop the refrigerator on my head one more time!
Roger, I dropped it on your head
23 times already.
- I can take it! Don't worry about me.
- I'm not worried about you.
I'm worried about the refrigerator.
I can give you stars. Look. Look!
Look!
Please, Raoul,
I can do it, I swear.
Just give me another chance.
Oh, come on, Raoul.
Toons.
Look! Look, Raoul! Look, Raoul!
Come on, Raoul!
Mr. Maroon, Mr. Valiant's here to...
He'll be right with you.
No, no, no!
Wait until he gets to his feet.
- Then hit him with the boulder.
- Right, R. K.
How much do you know about show business, Mr. Valiant?
Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
Yeah, and there's no business more expensive.
I'm 25 grand over budget on the latest Baby Herman cartoon.
You saw the rabbit blowin' his lines.
He can't keep his mind on the work.
You know why?
One too many refrigerators dropped on his head?
Nah, he's a Toon.
You can drop anything you want on his head. He'll shake it off.
But break his heart, he goes to pieces, just like you or me.
Read that.
"Seen cooing over calamari with not-so-new sugar daddy,"
"was Jessica Rabbit, wife of Maroon Cartoon star Roger."
What's this got to do with me?
You're the private detective.
You figure it out.
Look, I don't have time for this.
Look, Valiant, his wife's poison, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.
I want you to follow her, get me a couple of nice, juicy pictures
I can wise the rabbit up with.
- Forget it. I don't work Toontown.
- What's wrong with Toontown?
Every Joe loves Toontown.
Then get Joe to do the job,
'cause I ain't goin'.
Fella.
You don't want to go to Toontown, you don't have to go to Toontown.
Nobody said you had to go to Toontown anyway.
Have a seat, Valiant.
The rabbit's wife sings at a joint called the Ink and Paint Club.
"Toon Revue."
Strictly humans only, okay?
So what do you think, Valiant?
Well?
The job's gonna cost you
100 bucks, plus expenses.
A hundred bucks?
- That's ridiculous!
- So's the job.
All right, all right.
You got your 100 bucks.
- Have a drink, Eddie.
- I don't mind if I do.
- I got it.
- Careful, Dave.
- I got it!
- Dave, you're gonna drop it!
- I'm not gonna drop it!
- You're droppin' it!
Watch it! Oh, no! Jeez!
Come on!
Kind of jumpy, aren't you, Valiant?
- It's just Dumbo.
- I know who it is.
I got him on loan from Disney, him and half the cast of Fantasia.
The best part is they work for peanuts.
Well, I don't work for peanuts.
Where's the other 50?
Let's call the other 50 a carrot to finish the job.
You've been hanging around rabbits too long.
W-Whoop! Whoop!
W-w-
Oh, excuse me!
Please, help. Oh, I'm sorry.
Get out of my way!
Oh, taxi? Oh, cab?
Right here! Right here!
What do I look like, a bank?
Wait for me!
- Come on!
- Guys, wait up!
- Come on, hurry up! Come on, Sig!
- Hurry up!
- Hey, mister, ain't you got a car?
- Who needs a car in L.A.?
We got the best public transportation system in the world.
- Hey, so long.
- See you later!
- So long, mister!
- Thanks for the cigarettes.
- You bet.
- Anytime.
- Hi, Harry.
- Hey, Eddie. How's it going?
Okay. What you got for me?
The usual bills.
Hey, give back my ball!
Hello, fella.
- Hi, Harry. Are you okay?
- Hey.
What's with Earl?
- Laid off?
- A new outfit bought the Red Car.
Some big company called Cloverleaf.
No kiddin'. They bought the Red Car?
Yeah, and put the poor guy on two weeks' notice. Cutbacks, they said.
Oh, well.
Here's to the pencil pushers.
May they all get lead poisoning?
Tomorrow's Friday, Eddie. You know what happens here on Friday?
- Fish special?
- My boss checks the books on Friday.
And if I don't have that money
I gave you back in the till,
I'm gonna lose my job.
Don't bust a button, Dolores.
You've only got one left.
50 bucks?
Where's the rest?
Well, it's only a snoop job away.
You got that camera of yours?
Mine's in the shop.
Wouldn't be the pawn shop by any chance, would it?
Oh, come on, Dolores.
You need the other 50.
I need the camera.
Any film in there?
Should be.
I haven't had that roll developed since our trip to Catalina.
- That sure was a long time ago.
- Yeah, that was a long time ago.
- Let's do that again sometime.
- Yeah, sure, Eddie.
- That paper even good?
- Just check the scrawl.
R. K. Maroon, as in Maroon Cartoons?
Maroon Cartoons?
Hey. So who's your client,
Mr. Detective-To-The-Stars?
Chilly Willy?
Or Screwy Squirrel?
- What do you want to drink?
- I'll take a beer, doll.
So what happened?
Somebody kidnap Dinky Doodle?
Cut it out, Angelo.
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute. I know.
You're working for Little Bo Peep.
She's lost her sheep and you're gonna help her find them.
Hey?
Get this straight, meatball.
I don't work for Toons!
So what's his problem?
- A Toon killed his brother.
- What?
Dropped a piano on his head.
Got the password?
Walt sent me.
- Nice monkey suit.
- Wiseass.
All right.
Hey, look at that!
Hey! Hey! Cut it out!
Does anybody understand what this duck is saying?
- Most amusing.
- A little more wine.
I've worked with a lot of wise quackers, but you are despicable.
Doggone stubborn nitwit!
That did it!
This is the last time I work with someone with a speech impediment.
Oh, yeah?
This means war.
- What, you think that's funny?
- It's a panic.
You won't think it's funny when I stick that pen up your nose.
Now, calm down, son, will ya? Look, the stain's gone. It's disappearing ink.
No hard feelings, I hope.
- Look, I'm... I'm...
- I know who you are.
Marvin Acme, the guy that owns Toontown. The gag king.
If it's Acme, it's a gasser.
Put it there, pal.
The hand buzzer.
It's still our biggest seller.
Scotch on the rocks.
And I mean ice!
This is hot stuff!
Hey, those ducks are funny.
They never get to finish the act!
Great. Thanks.
- Toons.
- Cigars? Cigarettes?
- Eddie Valiant!
- Betty?
Long time no see.
What are you doing here?
Work's been kinda slow since cartoons went to color.
But I still got it, Eddie.
Boop-boop-be-doop, boop!
Yeah, you still got it.
What's with him?
Mr. Acme never misses a night when Jessica performs.
Got a thing for rabbits?
You had plenty money
In 1922
You let other women
Make a fool of you
Why don't you do right
Like some other men do?
Get out of here
Give me some money too
She's married to Roger Rabbit?
Yeah. What a lucky girl.
Now if you had prepared
20 years ago
You wouldn't be wanderin' now
From door to door
Why don't you do right
Like some other men do?
Get out of here
Give me some money too
Get out of here
Give me some money too
Why don't you do right
Like some other men
Do?
Who is it?
Jessica, dear, have no fear.
Your Marvin is here.
You sure murdered 'em again tonight, baby.
I really mean it.
My darling, you were superb.
You absolutely, truly and honestly
"fashmolyed" that audience.
You killed them. You slayed them.
You belted them into little pieces.
What do you think you're doin', chump?
Who are you callin' a chump, chimp?
And don't let me catch your peepin' face around here again!
Got it?
Ooga-booga!
Come, my dear Jessica.
Come over here.
I got everything arranged, right here on the bed.
Oh, not tonight, Marvin.
I have a headache.
Oh, Jessica, you promised.
Oh, all right.
But this time, take off that hand buzzer.
Patty-cake.
Patty-cake.
- Patty-cake. Patty-cake.
- Oh, Marvin.
Patty-cake.
- Marvin.
- Patty-cake.
- Patty-cake. Patty-cake.
- Oh, Marvin!
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Patty-cake! Patty-cake!
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!
I don't believe it!
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!
Is that true?
Take comfort, son.
You're not the first man whose wife played patty-cake on him.
I just don't believe it.
I won't believe it. I can't believe it.
I shan't believe it.
Believe it, kid.
I took the pictures myself.
She played patty-cake.
No, not my Jessica. Not patty-cake.
This is impossible.
I don't believe it. It can't be!
It just can't be! Jessica's my wife!
It's absolutely impossible!
Jessica's the light of my life, the apple of my eye, the cream in my coffee!
You better start drinking it black,
'cause Acme's taking the cream now.
Hard to believe. Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for 30 years.
Who would've thought he was a sugar daddy?
Somebody must have made her do it!
Now drink this, son.
It'll make you feel better.
Thanks. I needed that.
Son of a bitch.
Look, Mr. Maroon.
I think my work here is finished.
How about that carrot you owe me?
- A deal's a deal.
- Great.
Thanks.
Roger, I know all this seems pretty painful now, but you'll find someone new.
- Won't he, Mr. Valiant?
- Yeah, sure.
Good-looking guy like that.
The dames will be breaking his door down.
Dames? What dames?
Jessica is the only one for me!
You'll see! We'll rise above this piddling peccadillo!
We're going to be happy again!
You got that? Happy.
Capital H-A-P-P-I...
Well, at least he took it well.
Oh, Jessica!
Please tell me it's not true.
P-p-please!
Oh, Lieutenant Santino.
Where'd you come from?
Gee whiz, Eddie. If you needed money so bad, why didn't you come to me?
So I took a couple of dirty pictures. So kill me.
I already got a stiff on my hands, thank you.
Marvin Acme.
The rabbit cacked him last night.
What?
Now what?
It's just I haven't been this close to Toontown for a while.
Yeeow!
My biscuits are burnin'!
Fire in the hatch!
Eee! Great horny toads, that smarts!
Come on, Eddie.
Let's get this over with.
I didn't see anything.
Maybe you heard a noise or something.
- He's with me.
- Nothin'.
- Are you sure?
- Come on, kid.
Are you sure you didn't see anything?
- What about you, fella?
- I didn't see anything.
- I came in to work.
- Come on, Lieutenant.
Just like a Toon to drop a safe on a guy's head.
Sorry, Eddie.
You better wait here, all right?
You got a positive I. D.?
Must be.
Hey, Chisold, get a load of this.
You've seen one of these?
- Yeah.
- Hey, guys.
Didn't you used to be Eddie Valiant?
Or did you change your name to Jack Daniels?
- What's that?
- Paint from the rabbit's glove.
Mr. Valiant?
I hope you're proud of yourself and those pictures you took.
For crying out loud, Mike!
Hey, we need a little help over here!
Hey, somebody grab those loafers!
Hey, Mike, come here!
I got these. Come on. Come on.
Those shoes over there.
Is this man removing evidence from the scene of a crime?
No, Judge Doom. Valiant here was just pickin' it up for you.
Weren't you, Eddie?
- Hand it over.
- Sure.
His number-one seller.
I see working for a Toon has rubbed off on you.
I wasn't working for a Toon.
I was working for R. K. Maroon.
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.
He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures.
The rabbit said, one way or another, he and his wife were going to be happy.
Is that true?
Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?
Shut your yap, Eddie.
The man's in charge.
That's all right, Lieutenant.
From the smell of him,
I'd say it was the booze talking.
No matter. The rabbit won't get far.
My men will find him.
Look out!
- Weasels?
- Yes.
I find they have a special gift for the work.
All right, ya mugs. Fall out.
- Did you find the rabbit?
- Don't worry, Judge.
We've got "deformants" all over the city. We'll find him.
You wouldn't have any idea where the rabbit might be, Mr. Valiant?
Have you tried Walla Walla?
Cucamonga?
I hear Kokomo's very nice this time of the year.
I'm surprised you're not more cooperative, Mr. Valiant.
A human has been murdered by a Toon.
Don't you appreciate the magnitude of that?
Since I've had Toontown under my jurisdiction, my goal has been to reign in the insanity.
And the only way to do that is to make Toons respect the law.
How did that gargoyle get to be a judge?
He spread a bunch of simoleons around Toontown a couple years back, bought the election.
Yeah? What's that?
Remember how we always thought there wasn't a way to kill a Toon?
- Yeah.
- Well, Doom found a way.
Turpentine, acetone, benzene.
- He calls it "the dip."
- I'll catch the rabbit, Mr. Valiant.
Then I'll try him, convict him and execute him.
That's one dead shoe, boss?
They're not kid gloves, Mr. Valiant.
But this is how we handle things down in Toontown.
I'd think you, of all people, would appreciate that.
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey!
Hey, wait a minute! Hey, hey!
I've been tryin' to make him quit, but he just won't listen to me.
What do you know, you dumb broad?
You got the I.Q. of a rattle.
- You Valiant?
- Yeah.
I wanna talk to you about the Acme murder. Hey, doll.
Why don't you run downstairs and get me a racin' form?
Okay, okay. I'm goin'.
The lady's man?
My problem is I got a 50-year-old lust in a 3-year-old dinky.
Yeah, must be tough.
Look, Valiant, the rabbit didn't kill Acme.
He's not a murderer. I should know.
He's a dear friend of mine.
I tell ya, Valiant, the whole thing stinks like yesterday's diapers.
Look at this.
The paper said Acme left no will.
That's a load of succotash.
Every Toon knows Acme had a will.
He promised to leave Toontown to us Toons.
That will is the reason he got bumped off.
Has anybody ever seen this will?
No, but he gave us his solemn oath.
If you believe that that joker could do anything solemn, the gag's on you, pal.
I just figured since you were the one who got my pal in trouble, you might want to help get him out.
I can pay you.
Save your money for a pair of elevator shoes!
Wait, no! Valiant, no! Oh, my stogie!
It ain't my fault the rabbit got himself in trouble.
All I did was take a couple of lousy pictures.
Baby was right.
The hell with it.
- How the hell did you get in here?
- Through the mail slot.
I thought it would be best if I waited inside, seein' as how I'm wanted for murder!
No kiddin'. Just talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
Wait a minute.
Anybody know you're here?
Nobody. Not a soul except...
- Who?
- Well, you see...
I didn't know where your office was, so I asked the newsboy.
He didn't know, so I asked the fireman, the green grocer, the butcher, the baker.
They didn't know.
But the liquor store guy, he knew.
In other words, the whole damn town knows you're here!
- Get out of here! Come on. Out!
- Hey, take it easy, will ya?
- Out! Get out! Come on.
- Please, Eddie, don't throw me out!
- You're making a big mistake!
- Get out of here!
- I didn't kill anybody! I swear!
- Let go of that door, will ya?
This whole thing's a setup, a scam, a frame job.
Eddie, I could never hurt anybody.
My whole purpose in life is to make people laugh!
Okay, okay. Sure, I admit it.
I got a little steamed when you showed me those pictures of Jessica, so I rushed over to the Ink and Paint Club.
But she wasn't in her dressing room, so I wrote her a love letter.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You're telling me, in a fit of jealousy, you wrote your wife a love letter?
That's right. I know that she was just an innocent victim of circumstance.
I suppose you used the old lipstick on the mirror routine?
Lipstick, yes. Mirror, no.
I found a nice, clean piece of paper.
"Dear Jessica, how do I love thee?
Let me count the ways."
"One-one thousand, two-one thousand, three-one thousand..."
Why didn't you just leave the letter there?
Obviously, a poem of this power and sensitivity must... be read in person, so I went home to wait for her.
But the weasels were there, waiting for me.
So... So I ran.
So why come to me? I'm the guy that took the pictures of your wife.
Yeah, and you're also the guy that helped all these Toons.
Everybody knows, when a Toon's in trouble, there's only one place to go,
Valiant and Valiant.
Not anymore.
Get out of that chair!
- That's my brother's chair.
- Yeah. Where is your brother anyway?
He looks like a sensitive and sober fellow.
- That's it. I'm callin' the cops.
- Go ahead. Call the cops.
I come here for help, and what do you do?
You turn me in.
No, no, don't feel guilty about me.
So long, and thanks for nothin'.
That's the closet! Stupe.
Eddie Valiant, you're under arrest.
Get out!
Idiot. I got no keys for these cuffs.
Yah!
Come on. Get the lead out.
Move it, would ya? Move it!
Yah! It's the Toon Patrol!
Hide me, Eddie. P-p-please!
- Remember. You never saw me.
- Get out of there!
Don't let 'em find me!
Come on, Eddie. You're my only hope.
Open up in the name of the law!
- That's us.
- P-p-please, Eddie.
You know there's no justice for Toons anymore.
- If the weasels get their hands on me...
- Are you in there?
- I'm as good as dipped.
- Don't make us play rough, Valiant.
We just want the rabbit.
What are we gonna do, Eddie?
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?
What's all this "we" stuff?
They just want the rabbit.
It looks like they gave us the slip, boss?
Nah. Valiant's got him stashed somewhere.
Hold it right there.
Hello, boys. I didn't hear you come in.
Okay, wise guy. Where's the rabbit?
I haven't seen him.
- What's in there?
- My lingerie.
Sheesh, Valiant.
Search the place, boys.
And leave no stone unturned.
Look, Valiant, we got a reliable tip-off the rabbit was here, and it was "corrugated" by several others.
So cut the "bullshtick."
You keep talkin' like that, and
I'm gonna have to wash your mouth out.
Stop that laughin'!
You know what happens when ya can't stop laughin'!
One of these days, you're gonna die laughin'.
As for you, Valiant, step out of line, and we'll hang you and your laundry out to dry.
Come on, boys. Let's "am-scray."
- They're gone.
- Jeepers, Eddie, that was swell.
You saved my life.
How can I ever repay ya?
Blecch! For starters, don't ever kiss me again!
Stop kicking me. Stop kicking me.
Dolores. Dolores!
Dolores!
Hey, Eddie, you made the front page today.
- Yeah, I guess I made some ink.
- And what ink.
Come on, Eddie. Just let's go. Please!
So tell me, Eddie.
Is that a rabbit in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?
Cut the comedy, Dolores.
I've had a very hard day.
- I gotta get out of these cuffs.
- Oh, swell.
Jeepers, Eddie, that almost killed me!
Boy, what is this?
Some kind of a secret room?
It's a rotgut room.
A holdover from Prohibition.
Oh, I get it. A speakeasy, a gin mill, a hooch parlor.
- Tools are up here, Eddie.
- Look at this!
It's a spy hole!
Jeepers, Eddie!
This would be a great place to hide!
- Crazy Toon.
- Watch your head!
I thought you said you'd never take another Toon case.
- What'd you have, a change of heart?
- Nothing's changed.
Somebody's made a patsy out of me, and I'm going to find out why.
Hold still, will ya?
- Does this help?
- Yeah. Thanks.
You mean to tell me that you could have taken your hand out of that cuff at any time?
No, not at any time.
Only when it was funny.
Get out!
Come on, Eddie.
Where's your sense of humor?
He always this funny, or only on days when he's wanted for murder?
Listen, my philosophy is this.
If you don't have a good sense of humor, you're better off dead.
You just may get your wish unless
I can figure out what happened to this.
- What is it, Eddie?
- Just look at it.
- Mr. Acme's will.
- Yeah.
And I think Maroon played the part of sound mind and your wife the sound body.
Why, I resent that innuendo!
- What's the scheme, Eddie?
- I don't think they got to the will.
But how do you know?
Because they were still looking for it after they killed him.
Anything I can do?
Maybe you can go downtown and check the probate.
Yeah, check the probate!
Why, my Uncle Thumper had a problem with his probate, and he had to take these big pills and drink lots of water.
- Not prostate, you idiot. Probate!
- Let me get this straight.
You think that my boss, R. K. Maroon dropped a safe on Marvin Acme's head so that he could get his hands on Toontown?
Yeah.
That's my hunch.
Can he stay here for a couple of days?
He's not gonna do anything crazy, is he?
- Where are you going?
- Back to the office.
Mr. Valiant. Mr. Valiant?
You've got the wrong idea about me, Mr. Valiant.
I'm a pawn in this, just like Roger.
Can you help me find him?
Just name your price and I'll pay it.
Yeah, I bet you would.
You've gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
No, no, no. I love my husband.
You've got me all wrong.
You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
Yeah, well.
You don't know how hard it is being a man looking at a woman, looking the way you do.
I'm not bad. I'm just drawn that way.
Weren't you the one I caught playing patty-cake with old man Acme?
You didn't catch me, Mr. Valiant.
You were set up to take those pictures.
- What are you talking about?
- Maroon wanted to blackmail Acme.
I didn't want to have anything to do with it, but he said if I didn't pose for those patty-cake pictures,
Roger would never work in this town again.
I couldn't let that happen.
I'd do anything for my husband, Mr. Valiant.
- Anything.
- What a wife.
I'm desperate, Mr. Valiant.
Can't you see how much I need you?
Dabblin' in watercolors, Eddie?
Well.
Sorry.
Good-bye, Eddie. My offer stands firm.
Think about it.
Well!
Do you want to tell me what she was doing with her arms around you?
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
Come on, Eddie.
I caught you with your pants down!
Yeah, but I... Dolores, come...
Come on, Dolores.
You don't believe a painted hussy like that could turn my head.
She's just trying to get her hands on the rabbit.
That's not all she's trying to get her hands on.
Now, look, Dolores, listen.
Listen to me.
Look, I want you to go out, I want you to buy yourself a new swim suit,
'cause you and me are going to Catalina.
I'm on the verge of wrappin' up this case.
No, you're not, Eddie.
That's what I came to tell you.
I stopped by Probate.
Maroon's not after Toontown like you thought.
It's Cloverleaf that wants to get their hands on Toontown.
They put in the highest bid.
And unless Mr. Acme's will shows up by midnight tonight,
Cloverleaf is gonna own Toontown.
- What? At midnight tonight?
- That's right.
First they buy the Red Car, then they want to get their hands on Toontown.
I don't get it.
Yes!
Roger!
The rabbit. Get the judge.
A joke don't sit there on your brain
Nice shirt.
Who's your tailor, Quasimodo?
My buddy's Eddie V
A sourpuss, you'll see
But when I'm done he'll need no gun
'cause a joker he will be
C, D, E, F, G
H, I... I would love to raise some Cain
Believe me, it's no strain
It feels so great 'cause I'm so tight
And look, there is no pain
No pain. No pain. No pain
No pain. No pain. No...
- No!
- Hey, wait!
Yah!
Hey, who turned out the lights?
I can't see a thing! What's goin' on?
You crazy rabbit!
I've been out there risking my neck for you, and what are you doin'?
Singin' and dancin'!
But I'm a Toon. Toons are supposed to make people laugh.
Sit down!
You don't understand.
Those people needed to laugh.
Yeah, and when they're done laughin', they'll call the cops!
That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel.
Not Angelo! He'd never turn me in.
Why? Because you made him laugh?
That's right.
A laugh can be a very powerful thing.
Why, sometimes in life, it's the only weapon we have.
Laughter is the most...
"Ixnay." "Ix-nay."
I'm looking for a murderer.
A rabbit.
A Toon rabbit.
About yea big.
Look.
There's no rabbit here, so don't harass my customers.
I didn't come here to harass.
I came here to reward.
Hey. I seen a rabbit.
Where?
See?
- Where?
- He's right here in the bar.
Say "hello," Harvey.
I told you so.
The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down.
Quite a loony selection for a group of drunken reprobates.
He's here!
Stop that laughing!
Have you forgotten what happened last time?
If you don't stop this laughing, you're gonna end up dead, just like your idiot hyena cousins!
Say, boss, you want we should
"disresemble" the place?
No, Sergeant. Disassembling the place won't be necessary.
The rabbit is going to come right to me.
No Toon can resist the old Shave and a Haircut trick.
I don't know who's toonier, you or Doom.
Roger!
Ro... Roger.
Roger, no!
Roger, don't...
Shave and a haircut
Two bits
Hey, Judge, what should we do with the wallflower?
We'll see to him later.
Right now I feel like dispensing some justice.
Bring me some dip.
Does the condemned have anything to say before his sentence is carried out?
Why, yeah. I...
Dolores, a bourbon, and make it a double.
A fine time for a drink, Eddie.
Maybe you'd like a bowl of pretzels to go with it!
Pour the drink, Dolores.
Hey, Judge!
Doesn't a dying rabbit deserve a last request?
Yeah! Nose plugs would be nice.
I think you want a drink.
- How 'bout it, Judge?
- Well, why not.
I don't mind prolonging the execution.
Happy trails.
No, thanks, Eddie.
I'm tryin' to cut down.
- Drink the drink!
- But I don't want the drink.
He doesn't want the drink.
- He does! You do!
- I don't!
- I don't! I don't!
- You do!
- You do! You don't.
- I don't!
- I do!
- You don't!
Listen, when I say "I do," that means I do!
Come on.
Gotcha, kid.
Come on, Eddie, let's get out of here!
Move it, pops! Yikes!
That was quick thinkin', Eddie.
Nothing like using the old spine flower,
- the wise noodle, the smart puddin'.
- Roger!
- Yikes! Stop, will ya?
- Let's use this!
Yah!
Let's get out of here!
What are you waitin' for?
There's no damn key!
Hey, you weasels, let me out of here, will ya? Come on!
- I've got to make a livin'!
- Benny, is that you?
No, it's Eleanor Roosevelt.
Come on, Roger! Get me out of here!
Eddie, we got ourselves a ride!
Open the doors!
That's better.
I can't believe they locked me up for driving on the sidewalk.
Come on, Eddie. Get in!
- It was just a couple of miles.
- I'll drive!
- But I wanna drive!
- No, I'll drive!
I'm the cab. Out of my way, pencil neck!
How about this weather?
- It never rains!
- Would you beat it!
They've sprung the cab! Let's go!
And how about those
Brooklyn Dodgers?
Are they bums, or what?
Move over. I'm drivin'!
Benny, Eddie, we got company!
Will you look at these two?
Excuse me, ladies!
Now that's what I call a couple of road hogs.
- I'm gonna blow his head off.
- Benny, look out for the Red Car!
Benny, there's cops right behind us!
Not for long, Roger.
- No!
- Now they're right in front of us.
Eddie, we're goin' backwards.
Turn us around.
Give me the wheel. Give me the wheel!
- The cops are still on our tail!
- I know the cops are on our tail!
What do you think I am? Benny!
No. No!
Pull the lever!
- Which one?
- Which one?
Which one?
I'm gonna ram 'em.
What the heck?
I'm gettin' too old for this!
Jumpin' jeepers!
Hey, Roger, what do you call the middle of a song?
I don't know. A bridge!
- Well, fellas, where can I drop ya?
- Yeah. Somewhere we can hide.
I got just the place. And incidentally, if you should ever need a ride, just stick out your thumb.
Hey, share the road, will ya, lady?
Well, that wasn't so bad, was it?
Boy, did you see that?
Nobody takes a wallop like Goofy.
What timing, what finesse!
What a genius!
Ouch!
We're supposed to be hiding.
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
You're the only person in this theater that isn't laughing.
Is there nothing that can permeate your impervious puss?
Hey, Eddie! Boy, nothin'.
What could've possibly happened to you to turn you into such a sourpuss?
You want to know? I'll tell you.
- A Toon killed my brother.
- A Toon? No.
That's right. A Toon.
We were investigating a robbery at the First National Bank of Toontown.
Back in those days, me and Teddy liked working Toontown.
We thought it was a lot of laughs.
Anyway, this guy got away with a zillion simoleons.
We trailed him to a little dive down on Yockster Street.
We went in.
Only he got the drop on us, literally.
Dropped a piano on us from 15 stories.
Broke my arm.
Teddy never made it.
I never did find out who that guy was.
All I remember was, he was standin' over me, laughin', with those burnin' red eyes and that high, squeaky voice.
He disappeared into Toontown after that.
No wonder you hate me.
If a Toon killed my brother,
I'd hate me too!
Come on, don't cry. I don't hate you.
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.
You do hate me.
Otherwise you wouldn't have yanked my ears all those times.
Well, I'm sorry I yanked your ears.
All the times you yanked my ears?
- All the times I yanked your ears.
- Apology accepted.
Put 'er there, pal. I feel better. Oh, boy!
I hope it's another cartoon!
Jeepers, another stupid newsreel.
I hate the news.
- Did you get all my stuff?
- Yes.
It's all packed up in the car outside.
Would have been here right after you called, but I had to shake the weasels.
Yeah. I'm sorry about the trouble in the bar.
Oh, hell. Stuffing olives for a living wasn't for me anyway.
Dolores?
You oughta find yourself a good man.
But I already have a good man.
P-p-please, don't mind me.
You better get going, Eddie.
A near miss, but this miss says that's as good as a smile.
California Cloverleaf...
Glad Teddy's not here to see me running away with my tail between my legs.
It's not so bad once you get used to it.
The Pacific Red Car trolley line and the venerated
Maroon Cartoon Studios.
Here, R.K. Maroon is seen clinching the deal with Cloverleaf's bankers and execs in one of the biggest real estate deals ever in California history.
- That's it!
- Three-and-a-half million dollars...
That's the connection!
Let's forget it.
There's nobody here.
- Is that it, or are you scared?
- P-p-please! Me, scared?
Don't be ridiculous.
When you called Maroon, you told him you had the will, but you don't.
When he finds out, he's gonna be mad.
He might try to kill ya.
I can handle a Hollywood cream puff.
I just don't want the odds to change.
Now, you cover my back.
And if you hear or see anything, beep the horn twice.
Yeah, that's it. Beep the horn twice.
Cover your back.
Boy, I'm ready. Dukes up, eyes peeled, ears to the ground.
Why, nobody gets the drop on Roger Rabbit.
What's up, Doc?
Valiant, what are you trying to do, give me a heart attack?
You need a heart before you can have an attack.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You got the will?
Sure. I got the will.
The question is, do you have the way?
'Cause I can tell you now, it ain't gonna come cheap.
You got a lot of brass coming up here by yourself.
Who said I'm here by myself?
Let me see that will.
- I told you, I got it.
- I want to see it now!
"How do I love thee?
Let me count the ways"?
- This supposed to be a joke?
- No, this is.
Get up! Come on.
What are you gonna do to me, Valiant?
I'm gonna listen to you spin the Cloverleaf scenario.
A story of greed, sex and murder.
And the parts that I don't like,
I'm gonna edit out.
You got it all wrong!
I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer!
Everybody's got to have a hobby.
Oh, stop it. Stop it! Stop it!
The truth is, I had a chance to sell my studio, but Cloverleaf wouldn't buy my property unless Acme sold them his.
The stubborn bastard wouldn't sell, so I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.
Blackmail, that's all!
I've been around Toons all my life!
- I didn't want to see 'em destroyed!
- Toons destroyed? Why?
- If I tell ya, I'm a dead man.
- You're a dead man if you don't tell me.
Unless Acme's will shows by midnight tonight,
Toontown's going to be live for the free...
Roger!
- What the...
- Yeah, what in Sam Hill...
Eddie Valiant!
Well, you're a sight for sore eyes!
I ain't seen you in nigh on to five years.
- Where've you been?
- Drunk.
- You feeling frisky tonight, fellas?
- Yeah!
Let's go.
Yahoo!
Smile, darn ya, smile
You know, this old world is a great world after all
Smile, darn ya, smile
And right away watch lady luck pay you a call
Things are never black as they are painted
Time for you and joy to get acquainted
Hi, Eddie!
Hi, Eddie! Hi, Eddie! Bye, Eddie!
Tallyho! Tallyho!
Get out of here!
Going up, sir.
Yah!
Mind the step, sir.
Hold on, sir.
Yah!
Your floor, sir.
Have a good day, sir.
Gotcha.
A man!
Lover boy! It's Lena Hyena!
Oh, no!
- Oh, "wook," piggies.
- Hi, Tweety.
This "wittle" piggy went to market.
This "wittle" piggy stayed home.
- No.
- This "wittle" piggy had roast beef.
And this "wittle" piggy had...
Ran out of piggies.
Yah!
What's up, Doc? Jumpin' without a parachute? Kinda dangerous, ain't it?
Yeah.
Yeah. You could get killed.
- You guys got a spare?
- Bugs does.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, but I don't think you want it.
- I do! I do! Give it to me!
- Better let him have it, Bugs.
Okay, Doc. Whatever you say.
Here's the spare.
Thank you.
No!
- Poor fella.
- Yeah. Ain't I a stinker?
My man!
Come to Lena!
Toons. Gets 'em every time.
- Gesundheit.
- Thank you.
Valiant?
I always knew I'd get it in Toontown.
Behind you!
Drop it, lady!
I just saved your life, and you still don't trust me?
- I don't trust anybody or anything!
- Not even your own eyes?
That's the gun that killed R. K. Maroon, and Doom pulled the trigger.
- Doom?
- I followed him to the studio, but I was too late to stop him.
That's right!
You'll never stop me!
- You're dead! You're both dead!
- Doom!
- Which way'd he go?
- Well, I don't know.
- Well, he went that-a-way.
- Let's go!
Dum-dums.
- Come on.
- Yeah.
- Oh, no. Where's Roger?
- Roger?
He chickened out on me back at the studio.
No, he didn't.
I hit him on the head with a frying pan and put him in the trunk so he wouldn't get hurt.
Makes perfect sense.
We're obviously not going anywhere in my car.
Let's take yours.
I got a feeling somebody already did.
From the looks of it,
I'd say it was Roger.
My honey bunny was never very good behind the wheel.
- A better lover than a driver?
- You'd better believe it, buster.
It's the weasels. This way!
- We'll take Gingerbread Lane.
- No, wait! No, no!
Gingerbread Lane's this way.
So, Valiant, you call a cab, or what?
Hubba-hubba-hubba.
Allow me, mademoiselle.
So how long have you known it was Doom?
Before poor Marvin Acme was killed, he confided in me that Doom wanted to get his hands on Toontown, and he wouldn't stop at anything.
So he gave you the will for safekeeping.
That's what he told me.
Except when I opened the envelope, there was only a blank piece of paper inside.
- A joker to the end.
- So where to, already?
- My meter's runnin'!
- I have to find my darling husband.
I'm so worried about him.
Seriously, what do you see in that guy?
He makes me laugh.
I've been dipped!
What an unfortunate accident. Nothing more treacherous than a slippery road especially when driving in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
Good work, boss.
Don't just stand there. Help them.
- Put them in my car.
- Follow me.
And I think they'll enjoy attending the ribbon cutting at the Acme Factory.
Come on, you mugs.
We searched Valiant, boss.
The will ain't on him.
- Then frisk the woman!
- I'll handle this one.
Nice booby trap.
Do they have the will, or not?
- Nah, just a stupid love letter.
- No matter.
I doubt if that will is gonna show up in the next 15 minutes anyway.
- What happens in the next 15 minutes?
- Toontown will be legally mine.
Lock, stock and barrel.
Benny, is that you?
No, it's Shirley Temple!
Jumpin' jeepers! What happened?
Doom grabbed your wife and Valiant and took 'em to the Acme Factory.
The Acme Factory?
I know where that is. Get in!
Move over, Rog. You've done enough driving for one night.
Toontown right on the other side of the wall, boss.
You see, Mr. Valiant, the successful conclusion of this case draws the curtains on my career as a jurist in Toontown.
I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.
That wouldn't be Cloverleaf
Industries by any chance?
You're looking at the sole stockholder.
Benny, you go for the cops.
I'm gonna save my wife.
Be careful with that gun.
This ain't no cartoon, you know.
This is no way to make a livin'.
Wouldn't you know. Locked.
Can you guess what this is?
Oh, my God! It's dip!
That's right, my dear. Enough to dip
Toontown off the face of the Earth!
A vehicle of my own design.
5,000 gallons of heated dip pumped at enormous velocity through a pressurized water cannon.
Toontown will be erased in a matter of minutes.
I suppose you think no one's going to notice
Toontown's disappeared?
Who's got time to wonder what happened to some ridiculous talking mice when you're driving by at 75 miles an hour?
What are you talking about?
There's no road past Toontown.
Not yet! Several months ago,
I had the good providence to stumble upon this plan of the city council's.
A construction plan of epic proportions.
They're calling it a freeway.
Freeway? What the hell's a freeway?
Eight lanes of shimmering cement running from here to Pasadena.
Smooth, safe, fast.
Traffic jams will be a thing of the past.
So that's why you killed
Acme and Maroon? For this freeway?
- I don't get it.
- Of course not. You lack vision.
I see a place where people get on and off the freeway.
On and off, off and on, all day and all night!
Soon, where Toontown once stood will be a string of gas stations, inexpensive motels, restaurants that serve rapidly prepared food, tire salons, automobile dealerships, and wonderful, wonderful billboards reaching as far as the eye can see!
- My God, it'll be beautiful.
- Come on!
Nobody's gonna drive this lousy freeway when they can take the Red Car for a nickel.
Oh, they'll drive. They'll have to.
You see, I bought the Red Car so I could dismantle it.
What the...
Ay, caramba!
Okay, nobody move!
All right, weasels, grab some sky or I'll let the judge have it!
- You heard me. I said, drop it.
- Roger, darling!
Yes, it's me, my dearest.
I'd love to embrace you, but first I have to satisfy my sense of moral outrage!
Put the gun down, you bucktoothed fool!
That's it, Doom! Give me another excuse to pump you full of lead!
You thought you could get away with it, didn't ya?
We Toons may act idiotic, but we're not stupid!
We demand justice, but the real meaning of the word probably hits you like a ton of bricks!
Roger!
- Roger, say something!
- Look, stars!
Ready when you are, Raoul.
Tie the lovebirds together.
Come on, lovebirds. What you want?
Put them up on that hook.
Use that escape-proof Toon rope.
Time to kill the rabbit.
Oh, Roger, you were magnificent.
- Was I really?
- Better than Goofy.
Roger, darling,
I want you to know I love you.
I've loved you more than any woman's ever loved a rabbit.
It's over, Mr. Valiant.
- Look out, you fools!
- Not so fast.
One of these days, you idiots are gonna laugh yourselves to death!
Shall I "repose" of him right now, boss?
Let him watch his Toon friends get dipped, then shoot him.
With pleasure.
Everything's funny to you, ain't it, needle nose?
You got a problem with that, Valiant?
Nah.
I just want you to know something about the guy you're gonna dip!
Now Roger is his name
Laughter is his game
Come on, you dope, untie his rope and watch him go insane
- He's lost his mind.
- I don't think so.
This singing ain't my line
It's tough to make a rhyme
If I get stuck
I'm... I'm out of luck...
- I'm running out of time!
- Thanks!
Hey, Eddie, keep it up!
You're killin' 'em!
You're slayin' 'em!
You're knockin' 'em dead!
I'm through with taking falls
I'm bouncing off the walls
Without that gun I'd have some fun
I'd kick you in the...
- Nose!
- Nose? That don't rhyme with "walls"!
No, but this does!
Yikes! Oh, my goodness!
Jeepers, that was close!
Bye-bye!
Eddie, hurry! It's coming back!
- Oh, no!
- This is it!
This isn't it!
Wicked witchcraft
And although I know
It's strictly taboo
When...
Don't move.
No. No!
Yah!
Oh, no!
Come on, Eddie! Quit playing around!
- P-p-please!
- Help!
I wasn't worried. Were you?
- Hey, look!
- Hey, look!
Holy smoke! He's a Toon!
- Surprised?
- Not really.
That lamebrain freeway idea could only be cooked up by a Toon.
Not just any Toon!
Remember me, Eddie?
When I killed your brother, I talked just like this!
Jumpin' jeepers.
Oh, my goodness! Oh, no!
Good-bye, my darling. Good-bye!
I think I'm gonna faint.
Oh, no!
I'm melting!
I'm melting! Melting!
Eddie! Do something!
Hurry up, Eddie!
Do something!
Eddie, there's dip everywhere!
How are we gonna get down?
Jeepers, Eddie, that was a close shave.
I thought for sure our goose was cooked!
My hero.
- Oh, honey bunny.
- Oh, love cup.
Oh, Roger, you were a pillar of strength.
Sister Mary Francis!
What the hell happened in here?
I've been a cab for 37 years and I've never seen a mess like this!
What was that, a rubber mask?
Yeah.
And this is the rope from the safe that was dropped on Acme.
I think your lab boys will find that paint's a perfect match.
- Judge Doom killed Marvin Acme.
- And R. K. Maroon.
And my brother.
That's what I call one seriously disturbed Toon.
I wonder who he really was.
I'll tell you one thing, Doc.
He weren't no rabbit.
- Or a duck.
- Or a dog.
- Or a little wooden boy.
- Or a sheep.
- Or a woodpecker.
- Or a pussy.
- What's that? What is that?
- It's ink.
That goof Acme squirted me with some the other night.
- Why it's coming out now, I don't know.
- Here's your answer, Eddie.
Acme Disappearing Reappearing Ink.
- Boy, that Acme. What a genius!
- Applesauce!
If he was such a genius, why didn't he leave his will where we could find it?
Without it, we're just waitin' for another developer's wrecking ball!
- Roger.
- Yeah?
That love letter you wrote to your wife in the Ink and Paint Club.
Why don't you read it to her now?
Sure, Eddie.
"Dear Jessica, how do I love thee?"
"Let me count the ways. I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body..."
- It's the will!
- Give me!
"Do hereby bequeath in perpetuity"
"the property known as Toontown"
"to those lovable characters, the Toons!"
Hey, Eddie, that was a pretty funny dance you did for the weasels.
Do you think your days of being a sourpuss are over?
- Only time will tell.
- Yeah. Well, put it there, pal.
Yeah.
Don't tell me you lost your sense of humor already.
Does this answer your question?
Blech! Bleah!
Come on, Roger, let's go home.
I'll bake you a carrot cake.
Smile, darn ya, smile
You know, this old world is a great world after all
Smile, darn ya, smile
And right away watch lady luck pay you a call
Things are never black as they are painted
Time for you and joy to get acquainted
Okay, m-m-move along.
T-T-There's nothing else to see.
That's all, folks.
I like the sound of that.
T-T-T-T-That's all, folks!
[ People Chattering ]
HELLO TO YOU.
I HOPE YOU'RE FINE.
[ Woman ]
NOW, LET'S TRY SOMETHING
DIFFERENT: A CHALLENGE.
WHO KNOWS
THE ELECTRON WAVE FUNCTIONS...
FOR KRYPTONIAN
CONVALENT BONDING ?
SORRY.
LEYA ?
THE CUBE ROOT
OF THE WAVELENGTH
OVER THE NATURAL LOG...
OF THE INTEGRAL
OF THE SPEED OF LIGHT--
I THINK SQUARED.
WELL, MAYBE THAT WAS
A BIT TOO EASY.
GREETINGS.
GREETINGS, OLD FRIEND.
YOU LOOK WONDERFUL.
HELLO, KARA.
HELLO TO YOU.
OH, IT IS BEAUTIFUL.
WHAT'S THAT GOING
TO BE, ZALTAR ?
I THINK... A TREE.
A TREE.
WHAT IS A TREE ?
A LOVELY THING
WHICH GROWS ON EARTH.
EARTH ?  YOU MEAN
WHERE MY COUSIN WENT ?
AND TO WHERE ONE DAY SOON
PERHAPS I MIGHT VENTURE
AS WELL.
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
HOW ?
IN THAT.
THROUGH THERE.
THE BINARY CHUTE ?
BUT YOU COULD NEVER
SURVIVE THE PRESSURE.  IT--
THAT I CAN,
ZIP ZAP, AND I'M GONE.
BUT YOU'D NEVER
LEAVE US, ZALTAR.
YOU'D NEVER LEAVE ARGO CITY.
INDEED I MIGHT, KARA.
TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING HERE.
PERHAPS I'LL TRY
SATURN INSTEAD.
- YES, I THINK I MIGHT.
- SATURN IS--
IS THAT FURTHER AWAY
THAN EARTH ?
SILLY QUESTION.  DID YOU
NOT STUDY SIX-DIMENSIONAL
GEOMETRY AT SCHOOL ?
DO THEY NOT TEACH YOU
ANYTHING ANYMORE ?
WELL, OF COURSE THEY DO.
UH, I KNOW THE EQUATIONS.
UH--
I JUST CAN'T SEE THEM
IN MY HEAD.
MOST GREAT ARTISTS
FIND MATHEMATICS
TROUBLESOME, KARA.
ONLY USE YOUR IMAGINATION.
MM-HMM.
SATURN AND EARTH
ARE IN OUTER SPACE,
BUT WE-- WE ARE
IN INNER SPACE.
OUR CITY HAS
TWO GREAT POWER SOURCES.
THIS IS ONE OF THEM.
LOOK.
AN OMEGAHEDRON.
THE GUARDIANS
LET YOU HAVE IT ?
NOT EXACTLY.
I BORROWED IT.
YOU STOLE IT.
OH, ZALTAR,
THEY'RE GOING TO--
NO.  BORROWED IT,
FOR THE AFTERNOON.
FOR INSPIRATION.
INSPIRATION.
BUT I THINK THAT I SHALL
NEVER SEE THE BRANCHES
OF A LIVING TREE.
WHY ?  AN OMEGAHEDRON
CAN CREATE LIFE, CAN'T IT ?
IT CAN'T, CHILD.  IT CAN'T.
JUST THE ILLUSION OF LIFE.
IT'S A FANCY SHADOW
OF THE REAL THING,
WHICH IS THE MOST
WE CAN HOPE FOR
ON THIS LONELY OLD ROCK.
[ Woman ]
KARA !
KARA !
I'M HERE, MOTHER,
I--
[ Whirring ]
KARA, I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR YOU FOR AGES.
OH, I'M SORRY, MOTHER.
ZALTAR.
ALURA, JOIN US.
WE'RE JUST
INVENTING MIRACLES.
PUT YOUR FINGERS HERE,
KARA, AND PRESS HARD.
GOOD.  NOW, TRY IT.
LET YOUR
IMAGINATION EXPLODE AND
GIVE IT A TRY.  GO ON.
ZALTAR, MY HUSBAND TELLS ME
YOU TALK OF LEAVING
ARGO CITY.
FOR WHERE ?
PARTS UNKNOWN.
IT IS, ALAS, A FACT.
YOU AND ZOR-EL HAVE A LIFE HERE.
YOU HAVE EACH OTHER,
AND YOU HAVE KARA.
BUT, ZALTAR,
YOU FOUNDED THIS CITY.
IT'S YOURS.
AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE,
RIGHT TO THE VEIL,
SMACK, AND THEN WHAT ?
WHAT IS BEYOND ?
ALURA, I CANNOT CONTAIN
MYSELF TO ARGO CITY ONLY.
MY HEAD IS BOILING WITH IDEAS.
MY IMAGINATION IS TOO VAST.
IT'S UNCONTROLLABLE.
IF YOU WANT MY OPINION, ZALTAR,
YOU'RE STARTING TO REPEAT
YOURSELF...
WITH ALL THIS
AIRY, GLITTERY STUFF.
EXACTLY.  THAT'S WHY
I'M GOING TO VENUS.
VENUS ?  WHEN ?
TOMORROW.
OR THE NEXT DAY,
AT THE LATEST.
ZALTAR, HAVE YOU
THOUGHT ABOUT THIS ?
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME.
I HAVE THOUGHT INTENSELY.
MY MIND IS MADE UP.
- KARA, THE POWER SOURCE !
- [ Screams ]
ZALTAR !  SAVE ME !
PLEASE, HELP !
- NO !
- KARA !
ZALTAR !  HELP !  NO !

- [ Man ]  CALM DOWN, EVERYBODY.
IT'S ALL OVER.
YOU'RE HERE WITH US.
YOU'RE HERE WITH US.
YOU TOOK THE OMEGAHEDRON.
THAT'S NOT CORRECT.
I LOST THE OMEGAHEDRON.
OH, NO, FATHER.
I DID.
NO MATTER WHO.
WITHOUT IT,
THIS CITY CAN'T SURVIVE
MORE THAN A FEW DAYS.
OUR LIGHTS WILL GROW DIM,
AND THE VERY AIR
WE BREATHE SO THIN.
I KNOW.
SO I SHALL FIND IT.
I SHALL GO RIGHT
TO THE END OF INNER SPACE
AND I SHALL RETURN IT.
IMPOSSIBLE.  HOW ?
NO ONE CAN LEAVE ARGO CITY,
AND YOU KNOW IT.
THIS IS OUR UNIVERSE, AND
YOU'VE DESTROYED IT WITH
A GAME, A CHILDISH GAME.
I THINK
IT CAN BE DONE.
THROUGH THERE.
THE BINARY CHUTE,
IN THE TRAVELLER.
[ Man ]
LIKE A COWARD.
CHOOSE INSTANT DESTRUCTION WHILE
THE REST OF US ARE DOOMED TO
STAY HERE IN OUR BELOVED CITY...
AND SLOWLY PERISH.
KARA !
KARA, NO !
KARA !
NO !
YOU LUNATIC !
SHE'LL BE KILLED.
OH, NO, SHE WON'T.
SHE WILL BE SAFE.
THROUGH THE BINARY.
 THROUGH THE WARP.
- INTO ANOTHER REGISTER.
- ANOTHER WHAT ?
GRAVITATIONAL RADIATION.
A PATHWAY FROM
INNER SPACE TO OUTER SPACE.
THEN SHE'LL NEVER
BE THE SAME, EVER.
AT LEAST
SHE'LL BE ALIVE.
AND MY FATE IS SEALED.
I'VE LOST THE OMEGAHEDRON.
I MUST BE SENT
TO THE PHANTOM ZONE.
YOUR SUFFERING
WILL BE SHORT.
MINE... FOREVER.
[ Beeping ]
[ Explosion ]
SOME MORE CHAMPAGNE,
MY DEAR SELENA ?
WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING ABOUT ?
[ Sighs ]
SUCH A PRETTY WORLD.
I CAN'T WAIT
UNTIL IT'S ALL MINE.
THE ONLY WAY
YOU CAN RULE THE WORLD IS
TO BECOME INVISIBLE, MY PUMPKIN.
INVISIBLE ?
YOU'D ALMOST KNOW HOW
TO MAKE ME INVISIBLE.
OH, I DO KNOW.
TAKE FIVE BLACK BEANS
AND THE HEAD OF A DEAD MAN.
PLACE ONE BEAN IN HIS MOUTH,
TWO BEANS IN HIS EYES.
THEN--
NIGEL, ENOUGH.
BUT IT WORKS.
THEN YOU CAN GET ANYWHERE,
DO ANYTHING.
NIGEL, HOW LONG
HAVE WE BEEN TOGETHER ?
OOH.  MONTHS, DARLING.
THEN WHY DOES IT SEEM
LIKE YEARS ?
BECAUSE YOU'RE SO IMPATIENT.
YOU WANT EVERYTHING YESTERDAY.
IT TAKES A LIFETIME
TO DISCOVER THE SECRETS
OF BLACK MAGIC...
FROM THE ANCIENT
GRIMOIRES.
MORE CHAMPAGNE,
MY SWEETNESS ?
DON'T CALL ME...
"YOUR SWEETNESS."
I AM NOT SWEET.
I AM SELENA.
AND I AM A BITTER,
BITTER PILL TO SWALLOW.
- [ Whooshing ]
- HOLY... COW.
I WONDER--
IMMORTALITY
BE UPON THIS ONE.
SHE IS A SHARER OF
THE SUN'S EVERLASTING LIFE.
THERE WILL NOW
BE NO DANGER OF DEATH.
THIS WORLD
WILL KEEP HER FOREVER.
WHAT IS IT ?
WHAT'S GOING ON ?
WHAT'S GOING ON ?
I'VE JUST
OUTGROWN YOU, NIGEL.
THESE THINGS HAPPEN.
YOU CAN'T TREAT ME
LIKE THIS, SELENA.
WITHOUT ME,
YOU'D STILL BE READING
TEA LEAVES AT LAKE TAHOE.
[ Whirring ]
[ Radio Squeals ]
???? [ Rockabilly
     On Radio ]
YOU CAN'T RUN OUT
ON ME, SELENA.
I'VE GOT THE KEYS,
SWEETHEART.
THE PRESIDENT CONFIRMED REPORTS
THAT SUPERMAN HAS EMBARKED ON A
SPECIAL PEACE-SEEKING MISSION...
TO A GALAXY SCIENTISTS ESTIMATE
MAY BE SEVERAL HUNDRED TRILLION
LIGHT-YEARS FROM OUR OWN.
OH !
[ Gasps, Laughs ]
WHOO-WHOO !
[ Whinnying ]
[ Man On Radio ]
NOW HERE'S THE WEATHER
FOR THE GENERAL CHICAGO AREA.
INCREASING CLOUDINESS
WITH THE POSSIBILITY
OF SHOWERS.
BREEZY BUT WARM
WITH A HIGH OF 62.
BIANCA !  I'M HOME.
BIANCA !
WHAT ?
SHOW YOUR FACE.
I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU.
THEY TURNED OFF
THE HOT WATER AGAIN.
I'M REALLY GONNA HAVE
TO KILL SOMEBODY
DOWN AT THE D.W.P.
I FIGURED THE ONLY WAY THAT
WE'RE GONNA PAY OUR BILLS
NEXT MONTH IN THIS DUMP...
IS TO JUST GO AHEAD
AND START OUR OWN COVEN.
NO LONGER NECESSARY.
I WAS READING IN THIS BOOK,
THE WITCHES GUIDE
TO HEAVEN AND HELL.
IF YOU START YOUR OWN COVEN,
ALL YOU DO IS CHARGE FIVE BUCKS
A HEAD, MINIMAL ADMISSION.
CHICKEN FEED.
THAT'S BETTER
THAN GOOSE EGG.
WHAT'S IN THE COFFER
OF SHADOW THERE ?
WHERE'S LITTLE NIGEL ?
NIGEL, MY DEAR BIANCA,
IS HISTORY.
OH, YEAH ?  HOW SO ?
THE WATER DEPARTMENT IS HISTORY.
 THE CAR PAYMENTS ARE HISTORY.
THE MORTGAGE PAYMENTS
ARE HISTORY.
HOW ARE
THE PROPERTY TAXES ?
HISTORY.
THE WORLD IS AT LAST
MY OYSTER.
IF I CAN FIGURE
THIS THING OUT--
WOULD YOU MIND LETTING
BIANCA IN ON THIS UNEXPECTED
BIT OF GOOD LUCK ?
OR WHATEVER IT IS ?
BA-AD LUCK.
I HAVE BEEN CHOSEN.
THE POWERS OF DARKNESS...
I THINK MAY, AT LONG LAST...
HAVE COME TO THEIR SENSES.
YOU WANNA HEAR
SOME BAD LUCK ?
THE PHONE COMPANY SAYS...
UNLESS WE PAY THIS BILL TODAY,
THEY'RE TURNING THE PHONE OFF !
SHUT UP, SHUT UP.
WATCH.
LEARN SOMETHING
FOR A CHANGE.
[ Sizzling ]
[ Bianca ]
OH, MY GOD.
ARE YOU DOING THAT ?
[ Sizzling Continues ]
IT'S A TRICK, RIGHT ?
 IT'S A TRICK.
I THINK IT'S DONE.
SELENA, I THINK IT'S DONE.
[ Moaning ]
[ Whispering ]
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S GONNA TAKE
A LITTLE PRACTICE.
[ Beeping ]
[ Vehicle Approaching ]
[ Horn Honking ]
NOW, THIS I LIKE.
- HELLO.
- "HELLO," SHE SAYS.
WELL, HELLO TO YOU,
HONEY BUN.
HELLO.
I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU COULD TELL ME
WHERE I AM.
WHAT DO THEY CALL
THIS PLACE, EDDY ?
LOVERS LANE, ISN'T IT ?
YOU GOT IT IN ONE,
BILLY BOY.
LOVERS LANE.
OH, NO, YOU SEE,
WHAT I MEANT WAS--
WELL, THOSE
LIGHTS OVER THERE.
WHAT ARE THEY CALLED ?
CHECK OUT THE VIEW
FROM BACK HERE,
EDUARDO.
OH !
STOP THAT !
- HEY.
- YOU'RE SUPERMAN'S
  BEST FRIEND, HUH ?
NO.  HIS COUSIN.
I'VE COME HERE TO SEARCH
FOR THE OMEGAHEDRON.
IT'S A POWER SOURCE
VITAL TO ARGO CITY.
- THAT'S WHERE I LIVE.
 - NO KIDDING.
EDDY AND ME HERE,
WE'RE ON A SECRET
MISSION ALSO.
WE'RE OUT LOOKING
FOR A GOOD TIME.
AND YOU JUST WON
THE BRASS RING, BABY.
[ Groaning ]
- OH, SHE WORKS OUT, HUH ?
- WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS ?
IT'S JUST THE WAY WE ARE.
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
DONE THAT, BABY.
COME ON.
[ Gasps ]
OH, I SEE.
YOU REALLY WANNA PLAY GAMES,
EH, SWEETHEART ?
COME ON.  COME ON.
[ Groans ]
HUH ?
EDDY.
I THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD...
KIND OF KEEP THIS
TO OURSELVES.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ?
???? [ Pop ]
FREDDIE, YOU LITTLE
DEVIL, HOW ARE YOU ?
FRESH AMMUNITION,
EVERYBODY !
[ Guests Chattering ]
[ Man ]
WHO SAID THAT ?
IT'S TRADITION.
[ Laughing ]
TRY TELLING YOUR WIFE.
I NEED ANOTHER.
WHERE IS IT ?
WHERE'S THE LITTLE
MYSTERY BALL ?
LET ME HAVE A PEEK.
MAYBE I CAN SHED
SOME LIGHT.
I HATE LIGHT.
IS IT ELECTRICAL ?
 IS IT HOT TO THE TOUCH ?
WHERE IS IT ?
SAFE AND SOUND.
GO MIX.
LEAVE ME TO MY THOUGHTS.
GO MIX ?
WITH THESE PEOPLE ?
YOU MUST BE MAD.  WHO ARE THEY ?
WRINKLY LITTLE WRETCHES.
THESE ARE
MY FOOT SOLDIERS, NIGEL.
MY ARMY OF THE NIGHT.
I'M CONSIDERING
NOTHING LESS
THAN WORLD DOMINATION.
WORLD DOMINATION ?
SO YOU START BY LETTING BIANCA
GET ON THE PHONE...
TO THE LOCAL
PSYCHICAL RESEARCH SOCIETY
AND SAY,
"HELLO, GOT ANYONE OVER THERE
 WANTS TO JOIN A COVEN ?"
THERE ARE TIME-HONORED WAYS
OF DOING THIS, HONEYBUNCH.
CENTURIES-OLD RULES
TO FOLLOW.
I HAVE A SECRET, SELENA.
HOW EXCITING FOR YOU, NIGEL.
BEST WRITE IT DOWN
BEFORE YOU FORGET IT.
AFTER YOU LEFT ME IN THE LURCH,
I SAW SOMETHING THAT SHOULD
WORRY YOU GREATLY...
IF YOU'RE SERIOUS
ABOUT TAKING OVER
THIS PLANET.
MY SECRET WAS BLUE AND RED,
AND IT KNEW HOW TO FLY.
I'VE A SECRET, TOO, NIGEL.
I HAVE THE POWER.
NOW, GET THAT
THROUGH YOUR HEAD.
SELENA IS THROUGH WORRYING.
THE SHOE IS ON THE OTHER FOOT
AND IT'S THEIR TURN TO WORRY,
ALL THOSE WHO MOCKED ME
WHEN MY CHIPS WERE DOWN.
OH, I BET THEY'RE
IN FOR IT NOW, EH ?
COUNT ON IT.
I HAVE IN MY TIME SEEN
A GREAT NUMBER OF THINGS...
EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN
A HUMAN CIGARETTE LIGHTER,
DEAR LADY.
TO WIT.
WHAT IS THAT ?
OVERREACHING AMBITION.
TAKE HEED.
TOUCHED A LITTLE NERVE,
DIDN'T I ?
HELLO.
HELLO.
THE RED TOAD THAT LURKS
IN THE BRIARS AND BRAMBLES
IS FULL OF SORCERIES.
THERE'S A LITTLE BONE
ON THE LEFT SIDE.
A LITTLE BONE ?
A LITTLE BONE
WHICH IF BOUND TO A MAN
STIRS UP THE GREATEST LUST.
- I WANNA BE RICH AND FAMOUS.
- THEN STICK WITH ME.
I WAS PUT ON THIS EARTH
TO THRILL MILLIONS.
MMM.
THIS IS SCRUMPTIOUS.
WHY DON'T WE
GO SOMEWHERE ELSE
AND DANCE CHEEK TO CHEEK ?
[ Screaming ]
STOP IT, SELENA !
THAT'S NOT FAIR !
PICK ON ME !
[ Moaning ]
OH !
THANKS.
HEY, NO SWEAT.
WHAT HAPPENED ?
OH, NOTHING MUCH.
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE,
NIGEL,
AND DON'T COME
SLITHERING BACK.
LISTEN, SELENA,
I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN
SAVE YOU FROM YOURSELF.
YOUNEEDME.
LIKE AN ESKIMO NEEDS
A LAWNMOWER, KIDDO.
I'M WARNING YOU, SELENA.
DON'T BE SO SHORTSIGHTED.
OKAY, FOLKS.
THE SHOW'S OVER !
LET'S PARTY.
???? [ Pop Resumes ]
[ Chattering ]
FREDDIE, DARLING,
THANK YOU FOR COMING.
GOODBYE !
GOOD PARTY.
THANK YOU.
LOVELY TO SEE YOU.

[ Sighs ]
FOUR PEOPLE SIGNED UP.
WE GOT 20 BUCKS,
CASH ON THE BARRELHEAD.
FOURPEOPLE ?
THEY LOVED THE FOOD.
THEY WERE REAL IMPRESSED
WITH THAT SPINNING TOP NUMBER
YOU DID ON THAT GIRL.
BUT WHEN NIGEL WALKED OUT
THE WAY HE DID,
I GOTTA SAY IT HURT US.
THEY THOUGHT HE WAS
GIVING YOU A WARNING
TO SLOW DOWN.
[ Chuckling ]
ROME WASN'T BUILT IN A DAY.
A WARNING ?
 A WARNING, THEY SAY ?
NOBODY GETS
A WARNING ANYMORE.
GOOD MORNING.
[ Girl ]
HAVE YOU GOT IT, LUCY ?
IT MUST BE NEAR THAT OAK TREE.
FOUND IT, GUYS !
WHAT ARE YOU DOING

GEEZ, ANOTHER BARFY NEW STUDENT.
THEY'RE REALLY SCRAPING THE

HANG IN THERE,

DON'T LET 'EM
GET TO YOU.
THIRTY DAYS.
SEMESTER'S JUST STARTED.
YOU'LL BE--
HELLO.  I--
DIDN'T KNOCK.
DON'T WE TEACH YOU
MANNERS AROUND HERE ?
DON'T WE TRY TO IMPRESS
ON ALL OUR YOUNG LADIES...

IN THE JUNGLE NEVER KNOCK,
BUT MIDVALE GIRLS ALWAYS DO ?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING ?
COME BACK HERE.
[ Knocking ]
- COME IN.
- I FORGOT.
  I'M JUST NOT USED TO--
WAIT A MINUTE.
 WAIT JUST ONE SECOND.
I HAVE NEVER BEFORE IN MY LIFE
LAID EYES ON YOU,
HAVE I, YOUNG LADY ?
NO, SIR.  I'M NEW HERE.
WELL, OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE NEW HERE
IF I'VE NEVER LAID EYES ON YOU.
JUST WHO ON EARTH
ARE YOU ?

WHERE'S YOUR LETTER
OF RECOMMENDATION ?

I MUST TALK TO YOU,
PRINCIPAL.
I AM BUSY NOW.
SO ARE THEY.  THEM.
ALL THE LITTLE MONSTERS
YOU ADMIT TO THE PLACE.
THEY HAVE NAILED
MY DESK DRAWERS SHUT.
NEVER IN ALL MY YEARS
AS A SCHOOLTEACHER--
COME, DANVERS.
I WILL NOT BE PROVOKED.
I WILL NOT LET HIM GET TO ME
THIS SEMESTER.
I'LL BE STRONG.
BE STRONG.
BE LIKE A ROCK.
NOW, WHAT DID YOU SAY
YOUR NAME WAS ?
OH, YES, YES.
LINDA LEE, HUH ?
YES, MY COUSIN
PROBABLY WROTE YOU.
UM, MAYBE YOU GOT HIS LETTER
UNDER "K" FOR "KENT"
IN YOUR FILES.
KENT ?  KENT ?
IT DOESN'T RING ANY BELLS.
DOESN'T EVEN RING A--
WELL, HERE IT IS,
BIG AS LIFE.
"MY DEAR MR. DANVERS,
 I'M WRITING ON BEHALF
 OF A VERY SPECIAL YOUNG LADY"--
AN ORPHAN ?  WELL, DON'T EXPECT
TO BE TREATED ANY DIFFERENTLY
ON THAT ACCOUNT, MISS LEE.
- OH, NO, SIR, I WON'T.
- ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,
WE'RE ALL ALONE ON THIS
MISERABLE LITTLE PLANET.
YES, SIR, I KNOW.
SINCE YOUR SCHOOL RECORDS
WERE OBVIOUSLY LOST IN THE MAIL,
YOU'LL HAVE TO START
AT THE BOTTOM.
IT'S ONLY FAIR TO
THE OTHER GIRLS.  YOU'LL
HAVE ENGLISH, LATIN, MATH,
BIOLOGY, COMPUTING...
AND CHEMISTRY.
ALL AT ONCE ?
IDLE HANDS ARE
THE DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND.
THIS WAY.

AND YOU NEVER
WILL BE EITHER,
YOU LITTLE LIAR.
COME ON.  COME ON IN.
I HAVEN'T GOT ALL YEAR.
NO.  I'M SUPPOSED
TO HAVE A SINGLE
THIS TERM.
WE DON'T ALWAYS GET
WHAT WE WANT, MISS LANE.
DISAPPOINTMENTS
THICKEN OUR SKINS.
WHO WANTS THICK SKIN ?
[ Clears Throat ]
I'M LINDA LEE.
HI.
OH.  HI.
- I'M LUCY LANE.

NO, IT ISN'T.
SHE'S LINDA LEE, AND I'M--
LUCY LANE.
- YOU TWO KNOW EACH OTHER ?
- NO, WE JUST MET.
- WHEN ?
- JUST NOW.
THOUGH WE'VE KNOWN
EACH OTHER FOR YEARS,
HAVEN'T WE, LINDA ?
- OH, GEE, I DON'T THINK--
- OF COURSE.  THEDAILY PLANET.
  OF COURSE.
LINDA'S COUSIN WORKS THERE
AND YOUR SISTER--
WHAT'S HER NAME ?
THE ONE THAT'S ALWAYS
CALLING ME AND BOTHERING ME.
LOIS.
AH, YES,
THAT'S THE ONE.
ANYWAY, UH, SHOW OUR
NEW MISS LEE AROUND,
MISS LANE.
BY THE WAY, SHE'S AN ORPHAN.
BUT DON'T LET HER PLAY
ON YOUR SYMPATHIES, HMM ?
- SO WHO'S YOUR COUSIN ?
- CLARK KENT.
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.
CLARK KENT'S YOUR COUSIN ?
YOU'RE PUTTING ME ON.
- DO YOU KNOW HIM ?
- DO I KNOW HIM ?
DOES MY SISTER KNOW HIM ?
NOW, THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION.
OH, I SEE.  I GUESS IF THEY WORK
AT THE SAME NEWSPAPER,
THEY MUST KNOW EACH OTHER.
- WELL--
- IS THIS WHERE I'LL SLEEP ?
WELL, THIS IS YOUR BED,
BUT WE DON'T SLEEP
AROUND HERE.
NONSTOP EXCITEMENT
IN THIS DORM.
ALL THE REAL DEMENTOES
ARE SENT HERE.
SO, WHEN'S THE REST
OF YOUR STUFF ARRIVING ?
I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER STUFF.
WHAT, IT'S ALL
IN THAT LITTLE BAG ?
OH, WELL, YOU SEE,
I HAVE THE MEANS TO BUY MORE.
IT'S JUST--
WELL, I JUST HAVEN'T
HAD THE CHANCE SINCE--
- DO YOU KNOW HIM ?
- SUPERMAN ?  SURE.
MY SISTER'S GOT
SOMETHING GOING
WITH THE BIG GUY.
HEY, YOU CAN BORROW
ANY OF MY CLOTHES
ANY TIME YOU WANT.
JUST DIG IN
AND HELP YOURSELF.
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE VERY KIND.
HE'S A REAL CHARACTER.
A REAL HUNK.
I'LL INTRODUCE YOU
TO HIM SOMEDAY
IF WE WIND UP GETTING ALONG.
WELL, YOU HAVEN'T HAD
A CHANCE SINCE, WHAT ?
DID YOU HAVE A FIRE
AT YOUR HOUSE OR SOMETHING ?
FIRE ?
WELL, YOU KNOW.
HOW YOUR PARENTS GOT KILLED.
- I'D RATHER NOT TALK ABOUT IT.
- OH, SURE.
I'M SORRY.
ME AND MY MOTOR MOUTH.
NOW, THEN,
FOCUS YOUR TINY MINDS...
ON THE KIND OF PROBLEM
THAT USED TO TAKE WEEKS
OF THOUGHT BEFORE THE COMPUTER.
EVEN NOW IT CAN TAKE
A LONG TIME WITHOUT
CERTAIN ALGORITHMS...
WHICH, IF YOU BEHAVE
FOR TWO SECONDS,
I MIGHT REVEAL TO YOU.
LOVE.  HATE.
 LOVE.  HATE.
LOVE.
THE CARDS HAVE DECIDED.
PEOPLE WILL DO ANYTHING
FOR LOVE.
THEY'LL JUMP
OFF CLIFFS FOR LOVE.
THEY'LL DROWN THEMSELVES
LIKE LEMMINGS.
SO...
I'LL MAKE EVERYBODY
LOVE ME.
OH, NO CHANCE.
YOU'RE AN AWFUL PERSON,
HONEY, REMEMBER ?  FORGET IT.
USE YOUR IMAGINATION, PINHEAD.
THAT'S WHAT MAGIC IS ALL ABOUT.

- BUG OFF.
- [ Chattering Continues ]
ALL RIGHT.
 ALL RIGHT !

CLEAN UP THIS MESS ?

HEY, MYRA,
SEE IF YOU CAN
PUT LANE OUT FOR GOOD.
ARE YOU GUYS
ALL RIGHT ?
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT HAPPENED ?
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT ?
MYRA, HOW DID SHE DO THAT ?
IT JUST HIT HER SHOULDER.
LISTEN, YOU BETTER KEEP
AN EYE OUT FOR MYRA NOW.
SHE'S OUT TO GET YOU.
ME ?  WHY ?
BECAUSE SHE HATES ANYBODY
WHO'S NOT AFRAID OF HER.
HEY, YOU GUYS,
DID YOU SEE THAT CUTE GUY
ON THE SOFTBALL FIELD ?
OH, YES.
WITH THE BLACK HAIR
AND THE BIG MUSCLES.
HE WAS SOMETHING ELSE.
DID YOU TALK TO HIM ?
NO, BUT I'M GONNA.
HE'S WORKING ON THE TREES.
HE COULD BE AROUND FOR A WHILE.
ARE THEY IN ?
YES.
[ Hearing Voices ]
OH, BOY, I'M REALLY
GONNA ENJOY THIS.
I CAN'T WAIT
TO HEAR THEM SCREAM.
BUT, MYRA, WHY DON'T
YOU SHUT OFF THE HOT
AND GIVE THEM AN ICE BATH ?
ARE YOU KIDDING ?
THAT'S NOWHERESVILLE.
IF YOU SHUT OFF THE COLD,
YOU MIGHT SCALD THEM.
SO THEY LOSE A LITTLE SKIN.
SERVES THEM RIGHT.
I WANT TO SEE THEM SUFFER.

- YOU NEVER LOOKED BETTER !
WE'LL GET YOU ALL !
[ Girls Cheering ]
- WHAT DO YOU THINK ?
- IT LOOKS THE SAME TO ME.
  IT'S KIND OF DULL.
ALL YOU NEED
IS A COUPLE OF STREAKS
AND YOUR EARS PIERCED.
I CAN DO IT FOR YOU
FREE OF CHARGE.
- MY EARS WHAT ?
- PIERCED.
I TAKE A NEEDLE,
AND THEN I HEAT IT UP,
AND THEN I DAB IT
WITH SOME ALCOHOL AND, ZAP,
ALL THE GUYS GO CRAZY.
BECAUSE I HAVE HOLES
IN MY EARS ?
WHAT, ARE YOU PUTTING ME ON ?
SOMETIMES I CAN'T
FIGURE YOU OUT, LINDA.
SO WHERE ARE YOU GOING
THIS WEEKEND ?
NOWHERE.
NOWHERE ?  WELL,
YOU CAN'T STAY AROUND HERE.
THIS PLACE IS DEPRESSING.
I MEAN, LIKE THE TOMBS.
WHY ?
WHY ?
WHAT, WERE YOU BORN YESTERDAY ?
THIS IS A THREE-DAY WEEKEND.
A THREE-DAY WEEKEND.
SO, LISTEN, WHY DON'T
YOU COME HOME WITH ME ?
I ONLY LIVE ABOUT FIVE MILES
FROM HERE, AND I GOT THIS GUY
COMING UP FROM METROPOLIS.
I THINK HE KNOWS
YOUR COUSIN CLARK.
HIS NAME'S
JIMMY OLSEN.
I THINK
HE'S REAL STUCK ON ME.
ANYWAYS, I COULD ASK HIM
TO BRING A FRIEND ALONG.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?
OH, NOTHING.
NOTHING.  NO, I THINK
I'M GONNA STAY HERE
AND STUDY,
GET THINGS ORGANIZED.
[ Girl ]
DON'T FORGET
TO CALL ME SATURDAY.
JUST A SECOND.
HEY, LINDA,
I'LL SEE YOU LATER
IN MIDVALE THEN, OKAY ?
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TRY.  I PROMISE.
YOU BETTER.
IT'S GONNA BE FUN.
BYE.
BYE.  HAVE A GOOD TIME.
TAKE A SPIDER...
OFF HIS WEB...
AND SHUT HIM UP INSIDE...
TWO SHELLS OF A NUT.
NOW, BOIL THE NUT IN OIL,
INTO WHICH HAS BEEN ADDED
SOME OF THE WEB.
WITH A SILVER SPOON,
PUT TWO DROPS OF THE OIL...
INTO SOME WATER.
RIGHT.
HE WHO DRINKS THE WATER...
SHALL BE IN LOVE
WITH THE FIRST PERSON HE SEES,
SO LONG AS THE SPIDER
IS SHUT UP IN THE NUTSHELL...
[ Train Whistle ]
OR ONE DAY GOES BY,
WHICHEVER COMES FIRST.
BIG DEAL.  ONE DAY.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST USE,

I'M SAVING IT
FOR BIGGER THINGS.
HIYA, FOLKS.

I DON'T MIND IF I DO.
SO, UH,
WHERE'S THE LAWN ?
IT DROPPED DEAD.
WHERE AT EXACTLY ?
OUT BACK ?
I THOUGHT WE MIGHT GET
TO KNOW EACH OTHER
A LITTLE MORE...
BEFORE WE DIG IN
AND TALK REAL TURKEY.
[ Clears Throat ]
WELL, UM, SEE, I'M KIND OF
A PRIVATE PERSON, YOU KNOW.
I DO MY WORK.
 I GO HOME.
TO YOUR WIFE ?
NO.  AT THE PRESENT
MOMENT IN TIME,
I'M CURRENTLY ENJOYING
A SINGLE STATUS
IN MY PERSONAL LIFE.
CHEERS.
BOTTOMS UP, HUH ?
BOTTOMS UP.
[ Clears Throat ]
I, UH--
I NOTICED YOU GOT
A PRETTY ALKALINE-LOOKING
SOIL OUT THERE.
WHAT I WANT
ARE SOME HOUSEPLANTS...
INSIDE HERE.
SOMETHING THAT GOES WELL
WITH THE HOUSE.
THIS IS A HOUSE ?
OF COURSE
IT'S A HOUSE.
THERE'S THE BEDROOM
OVER THERE.
I THINK IT'S
GETTING DARK IN HERE.
YOU KNOW,
WHAT KIND OF PLANTS...
ARE GONNA WANNA
GROW IN THIS DUMP ?
- I DON'T KNOW.
- SHADE PLANTS ?
- HMM.
- TO US.
YEAH, I'LL, UH--
I'LL DRINK TO THAT.
MM.  YOU PROBABLY
KILLED HIM, YOU KNOW.
SLEEP WELL.
AND WHEN YOU WAKE,
DROWN IN MY EYES...
AND BE ALL MINE.
[ Door Buzzes ]
I'LL GET IT.
[ Buzzing ]
OH, HELLO, NIGEL.
IT'S YOU.
NICE SUIT.
- SUBTLE.
- I WANT TO SEE SELENA.
SHE'S INDISPOSED
AT THE MOMENT.
WHOEVER IT IS,
WE DON'T WANT ANY.
IT'S NIGEL,
AND HE'S NOT GOING AWAY
UNTIL HE TALKS TO YOU.
WHAT THE DEVIL
DO YOU WANT ?
I WANT
TO MAKE A VERY SERIOUS PROPOSAL.
- IN THAT OUTFIT ?
- THIS IS A LEISURE SUIT.
I'VE GOT THREE DAYS OFF
FROM THOSE LITTLE BEASTS
AT MIDVALE...
AND I INTEND
TO LET MY HAIR DOWN.
LET'S TALK.
TOGETHER WE COULD REALLY
RATTLE SOME CAGES.
KNOW WHAT I MEAN ?
I'M LISTENING.
MAKE IT SNAPPY.
[ Groaning ]
[ Bell Ringing,
  Woman Screaming ]
[ Ghoulish Screaming,
  Laughter ]
THAT BALL WILL NOT OPERATE
AT ITS FULLEST...
UNTIL YOU INTERNALIZE
YOUR POWERS, SELENA.
SOME MOSAIC INVOCATIONS.
SOME WHAT ?
COME AGAIN ?
EXACTLY.
THAT'S MY POINT.
YOU GIRLS ARE RANK AMATEURS
PLAYING WITH FIRE.
BECAUSE WE OWN
THE MATCHES.
I, OF ALL PEOPLE, KNOW
A HUSTLE WHEN I HEAR ONE.
GOOD-BYE, NIGEL.
IT WAS NICE TALKING
TO YOU, NIGEL.
NO, IT WASN'T.
- I HATE TO SEEM PUSHY,
  MY FAIREST OF THE FAIR, BUT--
- A WORD OF ADVICE, NIGEL.
IF I HAD YOUR SKIN PROBLEMS,
I'D STOP BOTHERING PEOPLE,
PUT A BAG OVER MY HEAD
AND GO LIVE UNDER A BRIDGE.
- OUCH !
- [ Bianca Laughs ]
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH MY SKIN.
YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE.
WHERE IS HE ?
 WHERE IS HE ?
[ Groaning ]
WHERE IS HE ?
WHOEVER HE SEES FIRST, HE'LL
LOVE WITH ALL HIS HEART.
WHAT, FOR A DAY, TOPS, RIGHT ?
HE WAS TOO YOUNG
FOR YOU ANYWAY, YOU KNOW.
NO, I DO NOT KNOW.
WHERE IS HE ?
HEY, I KNOW THAT GUY.
OH, THE CABLE'S OUT.
WHAT CABLE ?
THIS IS A MIRROR.
SO HOW COME
WE COULD EVER
SEE HIM IN IT ?
THAT WAS MAGIC, DAMN IT.
THE POWER.
OH.  SO MAKE IT
HAPPEN AGAIN, YOU KNOW.
I... CAN'T MAKE IT
HAPPEN AGAIN.
I DON'T KNOW HOW
 I DID IT THE FIRST TIME.
OH.
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
LET THAT THING OUT
OF ITS BOX, YOU KNOW.
MAYBE IT'S MORE POWERFUL
IF YOU LET IT OUT OF ITS BOX.
THE BOX.
WHERE IS IT ?
THE BOX.
THE BOX ?
IT'S UNDERNEATH THE RUG
WHERE YOU LEFT IT.
GO AHEAD.
IT'S STUCK.
[ Grunting ]
THIS IS NOT MY DAY.
IT'S STUCK ?
HOW COULD IT BE STUCK ?
IT'S GROWING.
HOW COULD IT
BE GROWING ?
IT'S MADE OUT OF LEAD.
OH, TOO BAD
THERE'S NO SOUND.
HOW COME
THERE'S NO SOUND ?
[ Horn Honking ]
GET OFF THE ROAD,
TURKEY !
HEY, DUMMY,
YOU WANNA DIE ?
WHAT ARE YOU SMOKING,
STUPID ?
YOU WANNA KILL YOURSELF ?
[ Woman ]
ANYWAY, SHE SAW A LAWYER,
AND NOW SHE'S GONNA FILE.
I TOLD HER TO TAKE HIM
FOR EVERY CENT,
CLEAN HIM OUT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
B.L.T.,
HOLD THE MAYO.
HERE YOU GO,
EVERYBODY.
WHO WANTS ONION RINGS ?
YEAH, HERE.
THANKS.
SOME FRENCH FRIES.
THE FRENCH FRIES

THANK YOU.
[ Girl ]
SIDE ORDER TOMATOES.
THANKS FOR INVITING ME, LUCY.
I'M GLAD YOU

[ Girl ]  YOU WANT A ROOT BEER ?
YEAH, THANKS.
OH, THERE'S LINDA.
- HEY, LINDA !  HI !

THAT'S CLARK KENT'S COUSIN ?
WHO'S CLARK KENT ?
[ Girl ]
IS THAT LINDA ?
GUESS WHAT.
WHAT ?
THERE'S THIS ALL-NIGHT
PARTY TONIGHT AT EDDIE'S.
HE'S THE GUY WITH THE TATTOO.
HIS FOLKS ARE OUT OF TOWN.
AND THE GUY WITH THE BOW TIE ?
THAT'S JIMMY.
SO YOU WANNA COME ?
OH, I DON'T KNOW.  I'M NOT
SIGNED OUT FOR AN OVERNIGHT.
SO WHAT ? 
GO BACK, SIGN IN
AND CLIMB OUT THE WINDOW.
MRS. MURPHY'S DRUNK
AS A SKUNK BY NOW.
TOTALLY ON ANOTHER PLANET.
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT.
BUT THAT'S WHY
IT'LL BE FUN.  OKAY ?
OKAY.
[ Tires Screeching,
  Horn Honking ]
GET OFF THE ROAD, BUDDY !
HEY, STUPID !
- HEY, YOU, SPACE CADET,
  GET OUT OF THE STREET !
- HEY, IDIOT !
WHAT IS WRONG WITH HIM ?
I DON'T KNOW.
HE'S PROBABLY ON DRUGS.
AND HE'S
GONNA GET CREAMED
IF HE'S NOT TOO CAREFUL.
HI.  JIMMY OLSEN,
PHOTOGRAPHER.
OH, I'M KARA.
WHO ?
WHO ?
OH, I'M... CONCERNED.
WELL, THAT IF WE DON'T
DO SOMETHING--
YOU GO OUT THERE AND TRY
TO HELP A GUY LIKE THAT...
AND HE'S PROBABLY GOT
A GUN OR A KNIFE.
IT'S NOT TOO SAFE.
HEY, I'M STARVING.
LET'S EAT.
COME ON, LINDA.
POWER OF SHADOW,
BRING HIM...
TO ME !
[ Engine Starts ]
WHOA.
WHOA !
LOOK AT THAT.
WATCH IT, BUDDY.
HEY, TURKEY,
GET OUT OF THERE.
LOOK OUT !  WATCH OUT !
IT'S COMING THIS WAY !
IT'S GONNA GET HIM !
WATCH OUT !
THERE'S NO DRIVER !
WATCH OUT !
[ Screams ]
- [ Man ]
  MY CAR.
 - OHH !
[ People Shouting ]
[ Sighs ]
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN
A TATTOO BEFORE, LINDA ?
LOOK !
WHAT'S THAT ?
[ Boy ]
I DON'T KNOW, BUT THERE'S
SOMEBODY HANGING OUT OF IT.
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S A RUNAWAY.
SOMEBODY'S
GOTTA DO SOMETHING !
LUCY, BE CAREFUL !
WHAT'S GOING ON ?
LUCY !
WAIT !
[ Jimmy ]
GET THE KIDS
OFF THE STREET !
OKAY, EVERYONE, LOOK HAPPY.
THIS WAY.  THAT'S IT.  GREAT.
[ Screaming ]
HEY, WHAT THE HELL'S

[ Woman ]
GET OFF THE STREET !
GET OFF THE STREET !
[ Groans ]
[ Woman Screams ]
[ Woman ]
SOMEBODY GET AN AMBULANCE.
OH, EXCUSE ME.
I'M IN A RUSH.
I KNOW THE FEELING.
[ People Shouting,
  Chattering ]
ARE YOU OKAY ?
[ Man ]
IT'S GASOLINE !
IT'S GASOLINE !
HEY, LOOK AT THAT !
A STORM DRAGON ?
A SUPER GIRL.
OH, MY GOD.
- [ Grunts ]
- DON'T.
DON'T LOOK AT HER.
YOU'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.
THERE'S NO BROKEN BONES.
I LOVE YOU.
WHAT DID HE SAY ?
 WHAT DID HE SAY ?
- LOOKED LIKE
  "I LOVE YOU" TO ME.
- NO !  NO !
YOU LOVE ME ?
[ Gasps ]
WITH ALL MY HEART FOREVER.
A BIRD OF FREE
AND CARELESS WING WAS I
THROUGH MANY A SMILING SPRING.
THE COLD REPULSE,
THE LOOK ASKANCE, THE LIGHTNING
OF LOVE'S ANGRY GLANCE.  STAY.
LET ME BEHOLD YOU.
I-- I HAVE TO GO.
LIKE MELTING WAX
OR WITHERING FLOWER,
I FEEL MY PASSION...
AND THY POWER.
OH, I-- I HAVE TO GO.
[ Man ]
WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING
UNDER CONTROL.
LUCY ?
JUST GO ON
BACK TO YOUR HOMES.
- LUCY.
- OH !
OH, THANK GOD.
YOU ALL RIGHT ?
I THINK SO.
 I HIT MY HEAD.
NIGEL MUST KNOW HER.
SHE MUST BE ONE
OF HIS STUDENTS.
- HE MUST'VE PUT HER UP TO IT.
- NO.  I DON'T THINK THAT
  AT ALL.
OH, SHE JUST HAPPENED
TO BE IN THE WRONG PLACE
AT THE WRONG TIME, RIGHT ?
MATERIALIZING
IN A BULLDOZER, HUH ?
SHE'S A WIMPY LITTLE THING.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY YOU
CARE WHAT SHE DOES ANYWAY.
BECAUSE NOBODY
GETS IN MY WAY.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST LEAVE
THIS POOR KID ALONE AND WORRY
ABOUT THE OTHER ONE THAT FLIES ?
I WORRY ABOUT EVERYTHING.
IT'S MY JOB.  STAND BACK.
AH, COME ON NOW.
SHE'S JUST A TEENAGER.
WHAT GOOD IS A SWORD
IF IT'S NOT UNLEASHED ?
BUT SHE'S A TOTAL ZERO.
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
HER NAME.
THE NAMING OF NAMES
IS NOT NECESSARY.
I'LL JUST CONCENTRATE
ON HER FACE,
AND MY SHADOW
WILL DO THE REST.
YOUR WHAT ?
POWER OF SHADOW,
TAKE SHAPE.
LOOK LIKE
A VICIOUS DARK STAR.
SEEK OUT THAT
WRETCHED YOUNG CREATURE...
AND DESTROY HER
WHEREVER SHE...
ARE.
OH, GOD, THAT'S AWFUL.
THAT'S NEVER GONNA WORK.
[ High-pitched Warbling ]
[ Yells, Gasps ]
[ Roaring ]
OH, MY GOD !
OH, I'M SCARED.
[ Screams ]
OH, MY GOD !
I'M SCARED !
NEXT TIME...
REMIND ME
TO DO THIS OUTSIDE.
[ Thunder Crashes ]
[ Thunder Crashes ]
LEAVE THIS PLACE
AND DO NO HARM.
[ Gasps ]
THERE SHE IS AGAIN.
WHAT'D SHE SAY ?
NO, THIS
IS NOT POSSIBLE.
THIS IS NOT RIGHT.
WHERE'S THE WIMP ?
[ Thud ]
[ Groans ]
HE CAN TAKE CARE OF HER.
SEE ?  WHAT'D I TELL YOU ?
SHE QUIT, RIGHT ?
WRONG.
[ Roaring ]
EVERY TIME !
EVERY TIME !
SEND A MAN
TO DO A WOMAN'S JOB,
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU GET.
DAMN HER EYES.
WHO IS SHE ?
- ARE YOU ASKING ME ?
- I'M TELLING YOU-- FIND OUT.
WELL, SURE, BUT, YOU KNOW,
I THINK I RECOGNIZE
THE COSTUME.
[ TV: Man ]
IT WASN'T HIS FAULT ?
THEN WHOSE FAULT WAS IT ?
[ TV Continues ]
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ?
OUTSIDE, I--
LOOK AT YA.
LOOK AT THOSE CLOTHES.
I'LL GO CHANGE.
I'M SORRY.
AND YOU'LL PUT ON
YOUR PROPER SCHOOL UNIFORM...
AND GET OUT OF
THAT RIDICULOUS COSTUME.
YES, MA'AM.
AND COVER YOUR LEGS !
YES, MA'AM.
DON'T YOU
"YES, MA'AM" ME.
NO, MA'AM.
I THINK YOU'RE
BLOWING THIS THING
OUT OF PROPORTION.
NO, THIS BOX
IS DEFINITELY
GETTING BIGGER...
AND UGLIER.
ALL I'M SAYING IS,
YOU CAN'T GO NUTS
OVER A LANDSCAPE GUY...
AND A TEENAGER
IN A BLUE SUIT.
SHE FLIES.
[ Sighs ]
CAN YOU GET THAT
THROUGH YOUR THICK SKULL
AND INTO YOUR TINY BRAIN ?
THE GIRL CAN FLY.
OKAY, NOW,
LET'S GET SERIOUS.
COME TO MAMA.
OHH !  OHH !
OH !  WHOA !
[ High-pitched Warbling ]
[ Warbling Continues ]
[ Warbling Quickens ]
[ Warbling

[ Warbling Fades ]
[ Warbling

SELENA, CUT IT OUT !
I'M NOT DOING IT !
[ Warbling Continues ]
[ Warbling Fades ]
[ Warbling Resumes,
  Volume Increases ]
I THINK WE'RE VENTURING WHERE,
YOU KNOW, FOOLS RUSH IN
AND ANGELS FEAR TO TREAD.
I'M NO ANGEL.
[ Warbling Continues ]
IT'S THE WIMP AGAIN.
- ANDSHE'STRESPASSING.
- [ Lid Clunking ]
FIRST THE SCHOOL,
NOW HERE.
YOU KNOW, THIS THING REACTS
WHENEVERSHE'SAROUND.
AND WHENEVER SHE SHOWS UP,
THAT GIRL THAT FLIES--
MM.
THAT "SUPER GIRL"--
ISN'T FAR BEHIND.
MAYBE THEY'RE BEST FRIENDS.
[ Footfall ]
- HELLO.
- OH, NO.  NOT NOW.
'TIS ONLY BUT ME,
MY LOVE.
PLEASE.
YOU'LL LET EVERYONE KNOW.
WHAT, THAT I LOVE YOU ?
I'D SHOUT IT
FROM THE HIGHEST HILL !
SHH !
PLEASE DON'T.
I KNOW YOU THINK ME THE FOOL,
BUT AT LEAST
TELL ME YOUR NAME.
LINDA.
 LINDA LEE.
LINDA.
LOVELY LINDA LEE.
THESE ROSES
PALE BESIDE THEE.
OH.  WELL, THANK YOU,
BUT I'M--
AND SWEET CHOCOLATES
FOR MY SWEET LINDA.
MMM.
[ Sniffs ]
[ Grunting ]
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?
PLEASE ?
OH, NO, I--
PLEASE ?
WELL, ALL RIGHT,
BUT JUST FOR A MINUTE.
YOU HATE ME, DON'T YOU ?
HATE YOU ?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
YOUR NAME.
ETHAN.
SAY MY NAME ALOUD BUT ONCE,
AND I SHALL DIE
THE HAPPY FOOL.
LOOK, ETHAN--
[ Gasps ]
ETHAN.
ETHAN.
HER SOFT CARESS DID AT ONCE
RENEW THE BEATING
OF HIS BROKEN HEART.
ARE YOU CRAZY ?
MARRY ME ?
MARRY YOU ?
I--
DON'T SAY IT.
 DON'T, PLEASE.
I KNOW.
WHAT ?
WE'RE FROM DIFFERENT WORLDS.
YOU MEAN YOU KNOW
WHERE I'M--
JUST GIVE ME
A CHANCE, LINDA.
LOVE MAKES EVERYTHING
POSSIBLE.
A POOR, UNEDUCATED GARDENER
CAN INDEED WORSHIP
A RICH DEBUTANTE...
AND MAKE HER HAPPY,
IF SHE'D JUST--
OH, ETHAN.
I'M NOT RICH.
WELL, THEN
I'LL SUPPORT US BOTH.
YOU'RE NUTS.
YOU KNOW THAT ?
YOU'RE SO SWEET,
BUT YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND.
OVER YOU.
WHAT A TOUCHING
SCENE.
ROUND AND ROUND THEY GO,
AND WHERE THEY STOP--
BOY, YOU'RE REALLY GETTIN'
THE HANG OF THIS.
[ Groaning ]
WHERE IS SHE ?
[ Both Gasp ]
JEEZ !
WHO ARE YOU ?
I AM SELENA,
DIODENES OF CATANIA,
PRIESTESS OF SEKHNET.
I AM THE ULTIMATE SIREN
OF ENDOR.
AND YOU, LITTLE LADY,
ARE TRESPASSING
ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.
SHE MEANS HIM.
I AM KARA OF ARGO CITY,
DAUGHTER OF ALURA
AND ZOR-EL,
AND I DON'T SCARE EASILY.
NO ?
[ Supergirl ]
NO.
TRY...
THIS.
[ Grunts ]
OH.  OHHH.
WHOA !  WHOA.
THIS LADY'S IMPROVING
BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS,
I GOTTA TELL YA.
[ Panting ]
[ Gasps ]
HEY--  HEY, WHAT--
WH-WHOA !
[ Grunts ]
[ Gasps ]
YOU OKAY ?
NO.
YOU WANT A HACKSAW
OR SOMETHIN' ?
[ Chanting
  In Unknown Language ]
[ Gasps ]
NOW I AM REALLY UPSET.
WHAT'S GOING ON ?
WHOA !
PUT ME DOWN !
WHERE AM I ?
YOU'RE SAFE.
SAFE ?
WHERE'S LINDA ?
PUT ME DOWN--
[ Grunts ]
WHERE'S MY LINDA ?
TAKE IT EASY.
[ Whooshing ]
ETHAN !
VERY CLEVER.
THAT OUGHTA KEEP HER OUT OF
YOUR HAIR FOR A FEW HOURS.
CLEVER ?
A CHEAP TRICK.
POWER OF SHADOW,
BRING HIM TO ME.
BRING HIM...
TO ME !
OHH !
DIDN'T WORK, HUH ?
MAYBE THEY'RE TOO FAR AWAY.
I CAN MAKE THE SKY
RAIN COCONUTS
WITH PINPOINT ACCURACY,
BUT I STILL CAN'T
CONTROL MEN'S MINDS.
NOT WITH HER AROUND.
SO MAYBE--
[ Sighs ]
NOW, DON'T GO THROUGH THE ROOF,
BUT MAYBE WE OUGHTA BACK DOWN...
AND GIVE OLD YOU-KNOW-WHO
A CALL.
YOU KNOW WHO ?
- SPIT IT OUT.
- NIGEL.
I SHALL PRETEND
YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT.
BUT I DID.
ALL I'M THINKING,
AND FORGIVE ME FOR THINKING
OUT OF TURN HERE,
IS THAT
HE'S BEEN AROUND.
HE KNOWS THINGS
WE DON'T.
PLUS, THE WAY YOU WRAP HIM
AROUND YOUR LITTLE FINGER,
I'M ALWAYS AMAZED.
[ Dial Tone ]
YOU MUST THINK ME
A BABE IN THE WOODS.
NOT AT ALL.
SCRATCH MY BACK,
AND I'LL SCRATCH YOURS.
WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME ?
ME.
AHA.
THINK OF THE COMBINATION,
NIGEL.
THE TWO OF US.
ONE MORE TIME, PLEASE.
MY DEAR NIGEL, THE WAY
TO A WOMAN'S HEART...
IS THROUGH THE ELIMINATION
OF HER RIVALS.
MURDER ?
ARE YOU PROPOSING THAT--
CERTAINLY NOT.
LEAVE THAT TO ME.
YOU DELIVER THE GOODS--
HER.
HER ?  HOW ?
BY GETTING ME...
HIM.
- SHE'LL FOLLOW.
- WELL, I DON'T.
- FOLLOW ANY OF THIS, I MEAN.
- PUT THAT DOWN.
NIGEL,
I WANT ONE THING--
TIME TO MASTER
MY NEW TOY.
[ Nigel ]
SO WE CAN RULE
THE WORLD ?
WE--
ANDSHE,
I HAVE BECOME CONVINCED,
POSES SOME VAGUE YET
POTENT AND UNDENIABLE THREAT.
SHE'S AUTHENTIC, THEN ?
THE SUIT IS NOT A JOKE.
IT'S NOT RENTED.
- THE CAPE FLAPS FOR REAL.
- WE HAVE EVERY REASON
  TO BELIEVE IT'S LEGITIMATE.
AND YOU WANT HIM HERE ?
JOHNNY APPLESEED
IN YOUR LIVING ROOM ?
YES.
IN THE FLESH.
SO SHE'LL FOLLOW ?
NO OTHER REASON ?
NONE.
YOU'RE SURE OF THAT ?
WHOOPS, I'M SORRY.
THE LITTLE SPIDER GOT OUT.
WHAT ?
WHERE AM I ?
WHO ARE YOU ?
KARA.
KARA ?
WHAT HAPPENED ?
YOU GOT HIT ON THE HEAD
BY A COCONUT.
HUH ?
WHAT'S WITH
THE HALLOWEEN COSTUME ?
THIS IS NOT A COSTUME.
THESE ARE MY CLOTHES.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?
- LOOK, I-- I HAVE TO GO NOW.
I WILL COME BACK FOR YOU.
I'VE JUST GOT TO GET BACK
TO THE AMUSEMENT PARK.
AMUSEMENT PARK.
LINDA !
I GOTTA FIND LINDA.
SHE WAS IN TROUBLE.
OH, LINDA'S ALL RIGHT.
SHE CAN TAKE CARE OF HERSELF.
NO, NO, SHE CAN'T.
SOMETHING'S WRONG.
SHE'S IN BIG TROUBLE,
AND I LOVE HER--
I LOVE HER.
YEAH, I DO LOVE HER.
I HAVE TO GO, ETHAN.
GOOD-BYE.
YEAH, SO DO I.
HEY !
I TOLD YOU,
LINDA CAN TAKE CARE OF HERSELF.
YOU JUST FLEW OVER MY HEAD.
I SAW YOU DO THAT.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING.
I SAID,
YOU JUST FLEW OVER MY HEAD.
TRUE OR FALSE ?
TRUE.
LIKE SUPERMAN.
HE'S MY COUSIN.
[ Snickers ]
HE'S YOUR COUSIN ?
YES.  I SHOULDN'T BE
TELLING YOU THIS, THOUGH.
WAIT, YOU CAN LEAP TALL
BUILDINGS IN A SINGLE BOUND,
LOOK RIGHT THROUGH THINGS ?
YES.
BEND STEEL BARS ?
YES.
WHOA !
OH, SELENA.
I HAVE TO GO.
SELENA HAS THE OMEGAHEDRON.
PLEASE TAKE ME WITH YOU.
I HAVE TO FIND LINDA.
WELL, NIGEL.
ARE WE IN BUSINESS ?
I'M THINKING ABOUT IT.
HE PROBABLY
CAN'T EVEN DO IT.
OH, INDEED I CAN,
BUT I NEED THE LITTLE
MYSTERY BALL.
NO WAY.
NO BALL, NO TRICK.
OKAY.
BUT I KEEP HOLD OF IT.
[ Bianca Gasps ]
- WHAT IS IT ?
- THE BURUNDI WAND.
PURE,
UNADULTERATED EVIL.
READY ?
BUT HOW CAN YOU LOVE HER ?
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HER.
OH, YEAH, I DO.
AND IF SHE'S IN TROUBLE,
THEN I GOT NO BUSINESS
STANDING HERE
TALKING WITH YOU,
EVEN IF YOU ARE
WHAT YOU SAY YOU ARE.
LINDA IS NOT IN TROUBLE.
LOOK, DON'T MAKE ME
GET ROUGH, OKAY ?
YOU WOULDN'T
STAND A CHANCE.
PLEASE TRUST ME.
LINDA IS ALL RIGHT.
HOW DO YOU KNOW ?
I JUST...
KNOW.
LINDA !
[ Bianca Gasps ]
OH, MY GOD !
HOW DID YOU DO THAT ?
ETHAN.
ETHAN !
NIGEL,
YOU ARE WONDERFUL.
PURE GENIUS.
YOU DESERVE...
ME.
AND SOMETHING ELSE.
NOW LET'S GET OUT
OF THIS DUMP.
[ Zap ]
[ Man ]
DID YOU SEE THIS THING ?
LOOK AT THIS !
WHAT'S THE MATTER ?
YOU CATCHIN' FLIES ?
LUCY, LOOK.
[ Man ]
ONE MINUTE NOTHIN',
THE NEXT MINUTE THIS.
WHAT IS IT ?
[ Man ]
DO YOU SEE WHAT I SEE ?
IT'S A MOUNTAIN, LUCY,
ISN'T IT ?
TELL ME I'M NOT
SEEIN' THINGS.
HOW DID IT GET THERE, JIMMY ?
I DON'T KNOW.
IT JUST APPEARED.
HOW CAN A MOUNTAIN JUST APPEAR ?
[ Lucy ]
HEY, THERE'S SOMETHING
ON THE TOP.
[ Jimmy ]
LOOKS LIKE A CASTLE.
[ Lucy ]
LOOKS MORE LIKE A FORTRESS.
ETHAN ?
ETHAN.
[ Chains Rattling ]
ETHAN !
ENJOY YOUR PRISON,
SUPERGIRL,
FOREVER AND EVER.
NO, ETHAN !
DON'T DO IT !
ETHAN !
[ Laughing ]
[ Laughing Continues ]
[ Grunts, Groans ]
WHERE AM I ?
[ Echoing ]
[ Grunting ]
[ Man ]  YOU CAN'T ARREST ME
WITHOUT A WARRANT !
I'M GONNA CALL MY LAWYER !
SLOW DOWN.
[ Girl ]
WE WANT SELENA OUT !
SMILE, LUNKHEAD.
YOU'RE NOT A GARDENER ANYMORE.
YOU'RE PRINCE ETHAN NOW.
HOW MUCH LONGER ARE
THE TELEPHONE LINES
GOING TO BE CLOSED ?
MY WIFE'S VERY SICK
IN THE HOSPITAL IN METROPOLIS.
I'VE GOT TO GET THROUGH !
[ Man ]
WHEN ARE YOU GOING
TO REOPEN THE AIRPORT ?
ARE WE GONNA STAND UP TO HER
OR NOT ?
[ Crowd ]  YES !
- SELENA MUST GO !
- WHO'S THIS LITTLE TWIRPETTE ?
SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES IN FREEDOM.
LUCY, IT'S NOT A GOOD TIME
TO EXPRESS YOURSELF.
I DON'T KNOW WHO
YOU THINK YOU ARE OR WHAT
EVIL FORCE YOU REPRESENT,
BUT IF YOU THINK YOU CAN
JUST GET RID OF ANYBODY
WHO STANDS UP TO YOU,
JUST MAKE THEM DISAPPEAR
LIKE MY FRIEND LINDA--
- WHO ?
- LINDA, MY ROOMMATE.
SHE DISAPPEARED
THE DAY THAT MOUNTAIN SHOWED UP.
[ Together ]
THE WIMP.
SEIZE THEM !
[ Shouting, Screaming ]
[ Jimmy ]
LEAVE HER ALONE !
[ Selena ]
DRIVE OFF.
LEAVE HER ALONE !
NOBODY MESSES AROUND
WITH JIMMY OLSEN !
LET GO OF ME !
I'M WITH THE PRESS !
[ Gasps ]
ZALTAR !
SQUIRT ?
ZALTAR ?
SQUIRT.
ZALTAR, IT'S ME.
IT'S-- IT'S KARA.
I KNOW.
SQUIRT.
[ Spits ]
WHAT IS THAT ?
WHERE ARE WE ?
WHERE ARE WE ?
HERE.
BUT WHERE ?
NOWHERE.
THE PHANTOM ZONE ?
IT'S LONELY HERE,
MY KARA.
SO SAD.
SO LONG AGO.
NO, ZALTAR, ONLY DAYS.
AND ONLY DAYS LEFT.
ZALTAR, WE HAVE
TO GET BACK TO EARTH.
WE HAVE TO GET THE OMEGAHEDRON
AND GET IT BACK TO ARGO CITY.
I'VE BEEN HERE FOREVER,
AND I SHALL STAY HERE
FOREVER.
ZALTAR, THE PERSON
WHO HAS THE POWER SOURCE,
SHE TRICKED ME.
SHE SENT ME HERE
AND I HAVE TO--
STAY HERE FOREVER TOO.
SHE SOUNDS FORMIDABLE,
SOMEONE TO BE RECKONED WITH.
SHE'S A SORCERESS,
A WICKED AND DESP--
MORE POWERFUL
THAN THE GUARDIANS,
IS SHE ?
BUT THE GUARDIANS
ARE GOOD.
ZALTAR IS BAD.
WORSE THAN
THIS WICKED SORCERESS.
SELF-PITY.
YOU ALWAYS TAUGHT ME
TO HAVE PRIDE, ZALTAR.
PRIDE--
SHOULD A MAN WHOSE
FOOLISH AMBITIONS...
DESTROY ALL THE HE LOVES
HAVE PRIDE ?
IF YOU THINK THAT,
THEN I AM A FOOL WHO
HAS TAUGHT YOU NOTHING.
[ Bianca ]
I GUESS OUR NEXT MOVE IS
TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD, HUH ?
I'M READY
WHEN YOU ARE, HONEY.
FIRST THINGS FIRST.
ETHAN.
YES, MY DARLING ?
DON'T CALL ME
YOUR "DARLING."
YOU DESPISE ME.
BRING ME
THE COFFER OF SHADOW.
YES, MY DARLING.
I THINK
WE NEED SOMETHING...
THERE.
[ Gasps ]
OH, JIMMY.
OH, TERRIFIC.
THE OLD DANGLING-IN-A-CAGE
ROUTINE.
PATHETIC, SELENA.
- WHO IS THAT GUY ?
- HE'S MY MATH TEACHER, I THINK.
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
A CEILING FAN, MYSELF.
BUT IT'S YOUR HOUSE.
WHAT ARE THEY FOR ?
INSURANCE.
BUT YOU CAN'T JUST GIVE UP.
YOU FOUNDED A WHOLE CITY.
I DID, AND THEN I DOOMED IT
TO DESTRUCTION.
THAT WAS AN ERROR,
A TRAGIC ONE.
WHEN YOU'RE MY AGE
AND YOU MAKE AS MANY
TRAGIC ERRORS AS I DO,
IT IS A DIFFERENT TUNE
THAT YOU WILL SING.
I WILL NOT.
 I WILL NEVER GIVE UP.
I WILL NEVER SPEND MY ENTIRE
LIFE IN A PLACE LIKE THIS.
I WOULD DIE FIRST.
STRONG WORDS.
THERE ARE WORSE THINGS
THAN DYING, AND I DESERVE
EVERY ONE OF THEM.
WHAT IS THIS ?
A HORSE, I THINK.
ON EARTH...
I THINK IT'S CALLED
A HORSE.
AND YOU MADE THIS HERE ?
MMM.
THEN YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN UP.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.
EARTH, ZALTAR.  A TREE, A HORSE.
YOU KEEP MAKING THINGS
FROM EARTH.
THE PLACE INTRIGUES ME.
THEN LET'S GO THERE.
CERTAINLY.
WHEN IS THE NEXT TRAIN ?
WHAT IS A TRAIN ?
[ Laughing ]
WHAT'S SO FUNNY ?
DON'T LAUGH AT ME, ZALTAR.
I'M ONLY LAUGHING AT MYSELF.
FOR YOU I WEEP.
IS THIS TRAIN
A WAY OUT OF HERE ?
THERE IS NO WAY
OUT OF HERE.
THAT IS THE POINT
OF THE PHANTOM ZONE.
MY NEIGHBORS KNOW--
THE CRIMINALS, THE CORRUPT,
THE EVIL.
THEY'RE HERE,
OVER THE HILL THERE,
WITH NO WAY OUT.
BUT...
THERE'S ALWAYS A WAY OUT.
IF THERE'S A WAY IN,
THERE'S A WAY OUT.
THERE IS A WAY.
- BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
- WHY ?
NO, IT WOULDN'T WORK.
YOU'D BE SWEPT
INTO A SINGULARITY
IF IT DIDN'T WORK.
FORGET I MENTIONED IT.
HAVE A SQUIRT INSTEAD.
I COULD DO IT.
THEN, PLEASE,
AT LEAST TEACH ME HOW.
THERE'S NOTHING TO TEACH.
YOU CAN'T, AS THEY SAY,
PRACTICE.
AT THE RIFT
YOU GET ONE CHANCE ONLY.
- THE RIFT ?
- SURE YOU WON'T HAVE A SQUIRT ?
ONCE YOU GET USED TO IT,
I THINK IT'S DELICIOUS.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
THERE IS ENOUGH
DOOM AND GLOOM
IN THE AIR ALREADY,
AND IT IS BETTER
TO ACCEPT DEFEAT...
THAN TO TAKE A CHANCE
AND TRY LIKE FOOLS
TO REDEEM OURSELVES...
AND SAVE OUR CITY
AND ALL THOSE
WE LOVE THERE,
PLUS ALL THE PEOPLE ON EARTH
THIS WICKED SORCERESS IS GOING
TO MAKE SUFFER BECAUSE OF US.
CHEERS.
WE COULD DIE TRYING.
BUT WE WON'T.
COME ON.
[ Wind Howling ]
TOMORROW.
THURSDAY.
FRIDAY.
JUST LIKE HERE,
WE GO FOR THE COPS FIRST,
RIGHT ?
AND THE ARMY.
BY SATURDAY
WE HAVE THE CONTINENTAL
UNITED STATES,
MEXICO, CANADA.
-WISH WE'D KEPT OUR MOUTHS SHUT.
-I'M NOT AFRAID TO DIE.
I'M PROUD OF US.
LUCY, THERE'S SOMETHING
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO SAY TO YOU.
GUESS I'D BETTER
SAY IT NOW.
UM, I'VE BEEN
IN LOVE WITH YOU F--
FOR MANY YEARS.
- [ Chuckles ]
  YOU HAVE ?
- MM-HMM.
[ Sighs ]  REMEMBER WHEN
YOU USED TO VISIT YOUR SISTER
IN THE NEWSROOM ?
YOU USED TO PUT
YOUR FINGERPRINTS
ON MY LENS.
REMEMBER ?
I WAS TRYING DESPERATELY
TO GET YOU ATTENTION.
- REALLY ?
- UH-HUH.
[ Chuckles ]
YOU MEAN, WE COULD HAVE--
WE COULD HAVE BEEN--
YOU KNOW WHAT--
ALL THIS TIME ?
- YOU BETCHA.
- [ Laughs ]
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME ?
- YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GUESS.
[ Wind Howling ]
AAH !
CAREFUL !
KARA !  KARA !
MY CHILD !
WHERE IS IT, ZALTAR ?
WHERE'S THE RIFT ?
WHERE IS IT ?
EVERYWHERE.
AND NOWHERE.
WE DON'T FIND THE RIFT,
 WE MAKE IT.
ZALTAR, NOW OF ALL TIMES,
NO DOUBLE-TALK, I BEG YOU.
DOUBLE-TALK ?
OUR LIFE IS TOO SHORT
TO SQUANDER IT
ON DOUBLE-TALK.
LOOK:
THE PHANTOM ZONE.
GET UP.

[ Loud Crash ]
[ Gasps ]
[ Wind Howling ]
WHAT IS IT ?
FASCINATING.
[ Ethan Laughs ]
I DON'T KNOW.
IS THIS IT ?
 IS THIS THE WAY OUT ?
NOT YET !
THIS IS THE QUANTUM VORTEX !
WE MUST RISK
OUR DESTRUCTION IN IT !
TO MOVE MOUNTAINS,
YOU MUST MAKE
SACRIFICES !
ZALTAR, I'M SCARED !
ACCEPT YOUR FEARS.
CONFRONT
YOUR DEMONS.
FIND YOUR DESTINY
IN THE MAELSTROM !
ZALTAR, I CAN'T !
I CAN'T !
YOU...
CAN !
[ Groans ]
[ Grunts ]

LOOK !
WHAT DO I DO ?
HOW DO YOU MURDER SOMEONE
IN THE PHANTOM ZONE ?

AND EVEN IF YOU DON'T,

HEY, NO !
[ Sizzling ]
I DON'T LIKE THIS.
DON'T WORRY, LUCY.
 DON'T WORRY.

IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.
AAAAH !
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

- NOW, MR. GOLDEN,
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?
- "HUNK."
CALL ME "HUNK" FOR NOW.
- ALL RIGHT.
- THANKS FOR SEEING ME
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.
NOBODY ELSE WOULD.
- YOU MADE IT SOUND LIKE
A MATTER OF LIFE OR DEATH.
- YEAH, WELL, IT IS.
FOR HIM.
- WHO IS HE?
- HIS--HIS NAME IS
BRADLEY BRINKMAN.
- WHERE IS HE?
- RIGHT HERE.
I'M BRADLEY BRINKMAN.
ON THE INSIDE ANYWAY.
- LOOK, PLAYING AT
SCHIZOPHRENIA IS NOT MY--
- YAH, I KNOW, I KNOW,
I KNOW.
LOOK, DOC, DIDN'T YOU EVER WANT
TO BECOME SOMEBODY ELSE?
SOMEBODY EXCITING,
SOMEBODY FANTASTIC?
I JUST HAPPEN TO BE THAT
SOMEBODY FANTASTIC BRADLEY
BRINKMAN WANTED TO BECOME.
AND THEN BECAME.
- SOMEBODY WITH A FANTASTIC
IMAGINATION, YOU MEAN.
- I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY,
BUT YOU GOTTA HEAR MY STORY.
TIME IS RUNNING
OUT FOR BRADLEY.
AND FOR ME.
- ALL RIGHT.
I'LL HEAR YOUR STORY, BUT TIME
IS RUNNING OUT FOR US AS WELL.
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST BEGIN
WITH THE FIRST TIME THAT YOU
BEGAN--
- AND BRADLEY BRINKMAN.
- THE FIRST TIME THAT YOU
AND BRADLEY BRINKMAN BEGAN
TO FEEL THIS WAY.
- DOCTOR, IF I CONVINCE YOU,
WILL YOU TAKE MY CASE?
- I'M LISTENING, MR. GOLDEN.
- UP UNTIL SIX WEEKS AGO, I
REALLY WAS BRADLEY BRINKMAN.
HACK, COMPUTER HACK.
I SPENT THE FIVE YEARS
SINCE COLLEGE CHAINED TO A
COMPUTER KEYBOARD.
EXCEPT FOR MY
IMAGINATION, THAT IS.
I ALWAYS DAYDREAMED
ABOUT BEING ONE OF THOSE
IMPOSSIBLY COOL GUYS
YOU SEE IN THE MOVIES
OR COMMERCIALS.
YOU KNOW, THE GUY THAT
DRIVE MASERATIS AND RUN
MAJOR CORPORATIONS.
THE KIND THAT DRIP WITH
WOMEN AND SELF CONFIDENCE.
YOU KNOW, THE GUY THAT LOOK
GREAT IN THOSE BIKINI BRIEFS
THAT RIDE UP THE
CRACK IN YOUR BUNS.
UNFORTUNATELY, PERPETUAL
DAYDREAMING DIDN'T LOOK
GREAT TO MY BOSS,
CONSTANTINE CONSTAPOPOLIS
OF CONSTAPOPOLIS COMPUTERS.
- DAYDREAMS?
I'M PAYING YOU TO
WRITE FOR ME DAYDREAMS?
- HI, MR. CONSTAPOPOLIS.
I WAS-- I REALLY--
I JUST DRIFTED OFF.
- YES, WAY OFF, BRINKMAN.
WAY OFF.
WAY OFF.
YOUR PROGRAM
PROPOSAL'S SO BAD,
THE K-9000 SHUT
DOWN WITH D.I. AGAIN.
- "DIGITAL INDIGESTION"?
- I'LL-- LOOK AT THIS.

WHO'S GOT A CAMEL
WITH A FLOPPY HUMP?
LOOK AT THIS ONE.

WHO ARE YOU
GONNA SELL IT TO?

LOOK AT THIS ONE.
SUSHI TOWERS.
EAT WHAT YOU BUILD.
YOU KNOW YOUR WORK HASN'T
BEEN THE SAME EVER SINCE--
- SUSIE ELOPED WITH HER
AEROBICS INSTRUCTOR. I--
- YEAH?
- I KNOW I KNOW-- HOW WOULD YOU
FEEL IF YOUR GIRLFRIEND
REJECTED YOU BECAUSE YOU
DIDN'T WEAR A LEOTARD AND
COUNT DURING SEX?
- LOOK, I'M RUNNING A
BUSINESS HERE.
YOU HAVE TWO
WEEKS--TWO WEEKS!
--TO MAKE A MONEY-MAKING
IDEA UP HERE,
OR ELSE YOU'RE OFF STUFFING--
- THE GRAPE all: THE GRAPE LEAVES IN MY
ONE-EYED FATHER'S
GREEK RESTAURANT,
CYCLOPS WEST.
- THANK YOU, MR. CONSTAPOPOLIS
FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING
AND GENEROSITY.
- HAVE A GOOD DAY.
- THE NEW PROGRAM
WAS DUE AT 9:00 A.M.
I WAS DESPERATE
FOR A CONCEPT.
ANY CONCEPT BUT EVERYTHING I
WROTE READ LIKE A ONE-WAY
TICKET TO THE SOUVLAKI
LINE AT CYCLOPS WEST.
IT ALL SEEMED BEYOND HOPE
WHEN I PUNCHED A DESPERATE
PLEA INTO THE MACHINE.
AND THEN IT HAPPENED.
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- SOME KIND OF DIGITAL VULTURE
APPEARED ON MY SCREEN,
AND THEN THE
COMPUTER BEGAN WRITING THE
PROGRAM BY ITSELF.
- WHAT PROGRAM?
- THE YUPPIE PROGRAM.
A MULTI-COMPATIBLE LIFESTYLE
BUDGETING--
- YOU WROTE IT?
I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT MINE.
WHY, I SAVED A FORTUNE
STOCKING MY WINE CELLAR ALONE.
NOT TO MENTION THE
COMPLIMENTS I GET FROM YOUR
RECIPE FOR MICROWAVE PATE.
- LIKE I SAID, THE
COMPUTER WROTE IT,
BUT I GOT THE CREDIT.
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
PATE OR PASTA MACHINES OR
THE YUPPIE-ING OF SUBURBIA
UNTIL I STAYED UP ALL NIGHT
READING IT MYSELF.
- NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.
HOW CAN A COMPUTER
WRITE BY ITSELF?
- NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD
ANYTHING YET.
I WOKE UP A HERO AND BECAME
AN EVEN BIGGER ONE WHEN
LEGIONS OF BABY BOOMERS SNAPPED
UP 50,000 COPIES
IN THE
FIRST SIX WEEKS.
MOM WAS PROUD.
DAD WAS PROUD.
HECK, EVEN SUSIE CALLED
TO SAY SHE WAS PROUD TOO.
TO HAVE YOURS TRULY FOR
A PHENOMENALLY SUCCESSFUL
EX-BOYFRIEND.
MR. CONSTAPOPOLIS PAID ME
A GIANT ROYALTY AND GAVE ME
THE SUMMER OFF WITH PAY TO
WRITE ANY PROGRAM I WANTED.
- SOUNDS WONDERFUL SO FAR.
- ALL I KNEW ABOUT YUPPIES
WAS THEY WEAR REEBOKS TO BED
AND WOULD HOCK THEIR HEALTH
CLUB CARDS FOR TEN MINUTES
ALONE WITH A DOVE BAR.
- HMM, WHERE DOES HUNK GOLDEN
FIT IN?
- AT THE BEACH HOUSE
I RENTED IN SEA SPRAY.
- SEA SPRAY?
PRETTY SWANKY PLACE.
- SWANKY?
WELL, LET'S SAY SEA
SPRAY IS SWANKY,
IF YOU'VE GOT BIG
BUCKS TO BURN.
THE ONLY THING SWANKY ABOUT
THE PLACE I COULD AFFORD WAS
THE DRIVEWAY.
THE HOUSE ITSELF WAS THE
OLDEST AND GRUNGIEST PLACE
ON SEA SPRAY BEACH.
BYE-BYE, BONUS.
IT WAS BUILT BY SOME OLD SEA
CAPTAIN WHO RAN OUT OF MONEY
AND RAN OUT OF TOWN BEFORE
HE COULD COMPLETE HIS
SAILING SHIP OF A HOUSE.
IT WAS IDEAL FOR
INVESTIGATING THE
YUPPIES-AT-PLAY LIFESTYLE
ON WHICH I WAS
SUPPOSEDLY AN EXPERT.
I'D LEISURELY CONCOCT MY
NEXT PROGRAM AND SPEND THE
REST OF MY TIME MAKING
MY DAYDREAMS COME TRUE.
- SO FAR, SO GOOD.
- EXCEPT THAT I
WENT A BIT TOO FAR.
NOW, THERE'S HELL TO PAY.
IN MY DAYDREAMS, ALL
I HAD TO DO WAS WINK,
AND THE WOMEN
WOULD COME RUNNING,
AND THERE WASN'T A BEACH
FULL OF TANNED AND TONED
COMPETITION EITHER.
THE OLD BOD DEFINITELY
COULD'VE USED A WORK-OUT.
- OH, THESE ARE FABULOUS.
LITTLE PIGGY
SALT-AND-PEPPER SHAKERS.
OH, I'VE GOTTA ADD
THESE TO MY COLLECTION.
OH, WELCOME TO SEA SPRAY,
WHERE THE WELL-TO-DO DO WELL
AT DOING WELL.
I'M POLLY CLUTTER, BUT
EVERYBODY CALLS ME "CHACHKA."
- I'M BRADLEY BRINKMAN,
BUT EVERYBODY CALLS ME
"BRADLEY."
YOU'RE IN MY LIVING ROOM.
- THOUGHT SO.
I SAW YOUR CAR OUT FRONT.
IS THAT A LOANER WHILE
THE B.M.W.'S IN THE SHOP?
- NO, ACTUALLY.
- OH, LOOK.
SOMEBODY IS GONNA FINALLY
GENTRIFY THIS OLD MESS.
GOOD FOR YOU.
- WELL, ACTUALLY, I'M JUST
RENTING THIS OLD MESS FOR
THE SUMMER.
- WELL, YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE
YOU COULD AFFORD TO BUY.
HE STARTED THIS PLACE AND
NEVER QUITE FINISHED IT.
CAPTAIN CRABIT.
- HOW DO YOU KNOW SO MUCH
ABOUT CAPTAIN CRABIT?
- WHEN I WAS A KID, I USED
TO HIDE FIRECRACKERS IN HIS
BARBECUE AND THEN LISTEN
FOR HIS HOT DOGS TO EXPLODE.
OH, HE ALWAYS HAD A FIRE
GOING, THAT CAPTAIN CRABIT.
- NO KIDDING.
- HEY, WHY DON'T YOU GO
PUT ON YOUR BATHING SUIT?
CHACHKA'S GONNA TAKE YOU
ON THE GABBY GUIDED TOUR.
- THE GABBY GUIDED TOUR?
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
IT'S FREE.
- SOUNDS GREAT.
HOW COME THEY
CALL YOU CHACHKA.
- OH, 'CAUSE MY HOUSE
IS FULL OF CHACHKAS.
I COLLECT THINGS.
KNICK-KNACKS.
BRIC-A-BRAC.
I'M AN INCURABLE COLLECTOR.
WHEN I MOVED OUT HERE FROM
NEW YORK IN THE '50s,
THE ONLY BUILDING
ON THE BEACH
WAS MY DAD'S HOT DOG STAND,
WEE WILLIE'S WEENIES.
- ♪ WEE WILLIE'S WEENIES, TOP
OFF WITH CHEESE AND BEANIES ♪ both: ♪ WEE WILLIE'S WEENIES,
BITE DOWN ON ONE TODAY, OLE ♪
THAT'S IT!
OH, IN THE '60s THIS PLACE WAS
BUFF BLUFF TOPLESS BEACH.
ON A HOT DAY, THE BOOBS WERE
PACKED TIGHTER THAN EGGS IN
YOUR EASTER BASKET.
- BORN TOO LATE.
- IN THE '70s MAHATMA
MAHARAJI WENT BANKRUPT
BUILDING THE WORLD'S FIRST
AND LAST CONDO COMMUNE.
NOW, WE'VE GOT YUPPIES.
WHO'S NEXT?
- SHE IS.
- WHO?
- HER.
SHE'S NOT REAL.
- WHERE IS SHE?
- RIGHT THERE.
NEXT TO THOSE SURFERS.
- THERE'S JUST A
COUPLE OF SURFERS.
- THE MOST GORGEOUS CREATURE
IN THE GALAXY IS STEAMING
RIGHT THIS WAY.
- YOU'RE IMAGINING THIS.
- HUH?
WHERE'D SHE GO?
WHERE'D SHE GO?
- HEY, HEY, TAKE IT EASY.
SHE DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE,
BECAUSE SHE WAS NEVER HERE.
HEY, HEY, COME ON.
TIME TO MEET THE HEAVY HITTERS
ON THE SOCIAL CIRCUIT.
OH, YOU'RE IN LUCK.
THEY'RE ALL HERE.
- DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL GET THIS ONE.
- IN "THE ADVENTURES OF
ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE,
"ARCH-VILLAIN BORIS BADENOV

- OPERA.

- IGOR STRAVINSKY, RIGHT?
- IGOR STRAVINSKY, WRONG.
- OUR TURN?
- YOU'RE THE BEST.
- NO, YOU'RE THE BEST.
- BUT YOU'RE THE CUTEST.
- YOU'RE THE CUTEST. both: TIE.
- BORIS GODUNOV, RIGHT?
- SEA SPRAY BEACH RULES FOR

TO THE LOSING TEAM.
- THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY
GET ONE RIGHT NEXT TIME. both: NO.
- WHO IS THIS GUY, CHACHKA?
- BARRY BRINKMAN.
HE JUST MOVED IN.
- IT'S BRADLEY BRINKMAN.
SORRY.
- BRADLEY.
I WANT YOU TO MEET
COASTER ROYCE,
WALL STREET WIZ AND YOUNGEST
VICE PRESIDENT IN THE
HISTORY OF RATCHET,
SLAMMER AND HOPS.
- RATCHET, SLAMMER,
HOPS AND ROYCE,
IF I HAVE A SAY IN IT.
AND I WILL.
I ALWAYS DO.
- AND THAT JET-SET ESCAPEE
FROM EAST COAST OLD MONEY,
ALEXIS CASH.
- HA HA.
WHERE YOU MOVING
IN, BRINKMAN?
- THE CRABIT HOUSE.
- I'M GLAD SOMEONE IS
GOING TO SPRUCE UP THAT
DILAPIDATED OLD DUMP.
THANK GOD.
- WELL, ACTUALLY, I'M JUST
RENTING IT FOR THE SUMMER.
- YEAH, YOU DIDN'T LOOK LIKE
YOU COULD AFFORD TO BUY.
NEED ANY COCKROACH TRAPS?
- WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU'RE SKEET
MECKLENBURGER, RIGHT?
ALL-PRO DALLAS ANNIHILATOR
LINEBACKER, RIGHT?
- "ALL-THROUGH"

UNCONDITIONAL WAIVERS.
- YEAH, BUT I CAN STILL
CUT IT WITH YOU, CAN'T I,

- WITH AN ELECTRIC

- YEAH, I LOVE THE LITE

YOU GUYS DO TOGETHER.
- OH, THANKS.
- A FAN.
HOW FLATTERING.
YOU PLAY V-BALL, BRINSKY?
- V-BALL?
V-BALL. OH, YEAH.
I'D LOVE TO, BUT I
HAVEN'T PLAYED IT IN AGES.
- DON'T WORRY.
SKEET KNOWS ALL THE RULES.
- THERE ARE A FEW DO'S AND
DON'TS IN V-BALL, BRINSKY,
SO LET'S START
WITH THE DON'TS.
YOU DON'T REACH
UNDER THE NET.
YOU DON'T RUN INTO THE NET.
AND YOU DON'T KICK SAND ON
AN OPPOSING PLAYER
WHEN HE'S DOWN.
GOT THE PICTURE, BRINSKY?
- SO WHAT IF THEY ALL ACTED
LIKE THEY HATED ME FROM BIRTH?
THERE WAS AN AURA
TO THEIR ARROGANCE.
I HAD TO FIT IN.
I YUPPIED OUT MY HOUSE WITH
EVERY TRENDY APPLIANCE MY
CREDIT LIMIT COULD BEAR.
AH, SO WHAT IF THE STUFF
WOULD NEVER FIT IN MY STUDIO
APARTMENT AFTER THE SUMMER.
I WAS LIVING IN THE MOMENT.
I EVEN PERSONALLY
STONEWASHED ALL MY CLOTHES.
I STILL HAVEN'T
FIGURED OUT WHY.
SEA SPRAY BY NIGHT
MEANS THE SAND CASTLE.
THE MEN ARE LOW ON BODY
FAT, THE WOMEN ARE HIGH ON
THEMSELVES ... AND WHATEVER
ELSE IS GOING AROUND.
I WAS READY FOR STEP TWO,
INVITING THE WHOLE BEACH TO
AN OPEN HOUSE AT MY PLACE.
I'D PARTY THEIR ASSES OFF.
INCLUDE MYSELF IN
WITH THE IN CROWD.
THE SEA SPRAY CROWD
ACCEPTS NO SUBSTITUTES,
AND I FELT LIKE
A SUBSTITUTE.
- HEY, HI, COASTER.
HOW'S IT GOING, GUY?
- WHERE DID YOU
GET THAT OUTFIT?
- WELL, I GOT IT AT
THE SEA SPRAY GALLERIA.
- OH, ALEXIS, DARLING.
BRINKMAN HERE WENT
SHOPPING AT
THE SEA SPRAY "SCHLOCKERIA."
- WHAT'S SO FUNNY?
WE'RE EXACTLY IDENTICAL.
- OH, FAT CHANCE.
- MIDNIGHT EXPRESS FOR MEN.
MADE IN TURKEY.
POLY-COTTON BLEND. both: OOH.
OH, GIORGIO
SPERMATUCCI STONEWASH.
SPERMATUCCI, MY
FAVORITE DESIGNER.
- THEY'RE 100% COTTON.
- THEY STONEWASH THEIR
DENIM IN SYNTHETIC STONES.
- BRINKMAN, A LITTLE ADVICE,
THE ONLY THING THAT YOU'LL
LAY TONIGHT IN THAT
IS LINOLEUM.
- OH, YEAH, YOU GUYS,
HERE'S AN INVITATION.
MY OPEN HOUSE.
TRY AND DROP BY.
- CATERED NO DOUBT BY
CHARLES DE GRAVY DU POISSON.
OH, WE WILL BE
THERE WITH BELLS ON.
BELLS.
- DING AWAY.
- AND THEN I SAW HER.
AGAIN.
- ARE WE PUMPED
IN THERE, BRADLEY?
- I WAS DANCING WITH THAT
INCREDIBLY GORGEOUS WOMAN
FROM THE BEACH,
BUT SHE VANISHED.
- OH, SURE.
HOW COME I CAN'T SEE HER?
WHERE'D SHE GO?
- HELL, IF I KNOW.
- THE FINAL SCORE FOR MY
OPEN HOUSE WAS HOST-ONE,
GUESTS-ZERO.
TALK ABOUT WOUNDED PRIDE,
MINE WAS DEAD ON ARRIVAL.
A NIGHTMARE IN LEFTOVER
ARTICHOKE HEARTS.
- HELLO.
CHACHKA, UH-- CHACHKA,
BABY, HOW ARE YA?
OH, FANTASTIC.
FANTASTIC TURN-OUT, YEAH.
YEAH!
WHAT?
OH, YOU CAN'T MAKE IT OVER.
OH, BABE, WE'RE
GONNA MISS YA, YEAH.
GREAT PARTY, BRADLEY.
YEAH, DUDE, GREAT PARTY.
WHAT?
LEFTOVERS?
UH, NO, I DON'T THINK SO.
THESE PARTY ANIMALS,
THEY ARE PIGGING OUT.
YEAH, PIGGING OUT, YEAH.
WHAT?
BABE, I CAN'T HEAR YOU.
YOU GOTTA SPEAK UP FOR ME, OKAY?
NO, NO, HONEY
I CAN'T HEAR YOU.
I'LL TALK TO YOU
TOMORROW, OKAY?
YEAH, YEAH.
BYE!
"ANY LEFTOVERS."
SHE'LL PROBABLY BE RIGHT
OVER WITH TUPPERWARE.
- SUPPOSE YOU GAVE AN OPEN
HOUSE, AND NOBODY CAME.
WE CAN'T HAVE THAT NOW,
CAN WE, COMPUTER CHAMP?
- WAIT A MINUTE.
DON'T DISAPPEAR.
OKAY.
WHO ARE YOU, AND HOW DO YOU KNOW
SO MUCH ABOUT ME?
AND AM I THE ONLY
PERSON WHO CAN SEE YOU?
- AROUSED?
YOUR CURIOSITY, I MEAN.
BRADLEY, A GIRL IN MY LINE
WORKS UP A DEVILISH THIRST.
AREN'T YOU GONNA INVITE
ME TO STAY FOR A PERRIER?
WOW, THE FOOD'S JUST
TO DIE FOR, BRADLEY.
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD
BE ONE FABULOUS HOST.
IT'S A SHAME YOU
DON'T RECOGNIZE IT.
- YOU'VE HAD THE FOOD,
AND YOU'VE HAD YOUR FUN.
NOW, WHO ARE YOU?
- MY NAME'S O'BRIEN.
- JUST O'BRIEN?
- JUST O'BRIEN.
- AND WHERE DO
YOU LIVE, O'BRIEN?
- HELL.
I HAVE A LARGE STUDIO APARTMENT
AT 1,700 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.
OF COURSE, I WANT A ONE-BEDROOM
AT 2,500 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.
OR A LOFT IN THE CELSIUS
NEIGHBORHOOD,
BUT ANYTHING OVER 2,000 DEGREES
IS A FORTUNE.
IT'S HELL TO FIND A DECENT
PLACE TO LIVE IN HELL.
- WHO WRITES YOUR MATERIAL,
DAVID LETTERMAN?
CUTE.
VERY CLEVER.
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?
- OKAY, LISTEN UP, BRADLEY,
BECAUSE I'M ONLY GONNA READ
YOUR BLACK MAGIC
RIGHTS ONCE.
- OH.
- BE FOREWARNED--
- SORRY.
- BE FOREWARNED, YOU'RE
ABOUT TO BE SOLICITED FOR A
SUPERNATURAL EXPERIENCE.
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO CALL AN EXORCIST.
IF YOU CANNOT
AFFORD AN EXORCIST,
ONE WILL BE
APPOINTED TO YOU.
ANY BLACK MAGIC COVENANTS
HEREAFTER EXECUTED BY YOU
CAN AND WILL BE USED TO
ASSERT DARK DOMINION OVER
YOUR SOUL.
ANY QUESTIONS?
- YEAH.
WHY ME?
- I'VE HAD MY EVIL
ON YOU A LONG TIME.
BRADLEY, YOU NEED
A FRIEND RIGHT NOW.
WHO DO YOU THINK INSPIRED
THE YUPPIE PROGRAM?
- WAIT A MINUTE.
THIS WAS ON MY COMPUTER.
YOU POSSESSED MY WORD
PROCESSOR THAT NIGHT?
- LET'S CALL IT
"TEMPORARY OCCUPANCY."
- THIS CONVERSATION IS
INSANE, AND SO ARE YOU.
- ONE QUESTION, BRADLEY.
ARE YOU HAPPY YOU RENTED THIS
FABULOUS HOUSE
SO CLOSE TO ROYCE, COULD WIPE
HIS TOPSIDERS ON YOUR FACE
AT THE DROP OF A FRISBEE?
HAPPY WOMEN AROUND HERE
WON'T GIVE YOU THE CORRECT TIME
OF DAY AT A ROLEX CONVENTION?
- WELL--
- I CAN MAKE YOU OVER.
MAKE YOU INTO THE
KIND OF MAN YOU'VE ALWAYS
DAYDREAMED ABOUT.
THE KIND OF MAN
WOMEN WANT MOST.
AND MEN WANT MOST TO BE.
A HUNK.
HANDSOME, TANNED, TONED.
RICH, BRADLEY.
SUCCESSFUL.
ADMIRED.
- WHAT'S ALL THIS
GONNA COST ME?
- OH, YOUR SOUL, SILLY BOY.
AND WOULD YOU
BELIEVE, RIGHT NOW,
WE HAVE A NO-OBLIGATION
SELL-YOUR-SOUL-FOR-THE-SUMMER
TRIAL OFFER?
AND IF YOU ARE NOT
100% SATISFIED,
YOUR OLD BODY AND OLD
SOUL WILL BE REFUNDED.
IT'S A PACKAGE DEAL.
- ARE YOU PART OF
THE PACKAGE DEAL?
- OH, THE DEVIL HIMSELF,
INCORPORATED,
FORBIDS MY DATING CLIENTS
WHILE THEIR SOUL IS IN
SPIRITUAL ESCROW.
- THE DEVIL HIMSELF,
INCORPORATED?
- THE BOSS NEEDS TAX
WRITE-OFFS JUST LIKE YOU.
- WE'LL STILL SEE
EACH OTHER, WON'T WE?
- OH, FOR ETERNITY,
IF YOU WANT.
SO GIVE IT A GO
FOR THE SUMMER?
- AND NOW I'M SUPPOSED TO SIGN
SOMETHING IN BLOOD, RIGHT?
- A HYPODERMIC PEN.
NO MUSS, NO FUSS.
IT'S MY LATEST INVENTION.
- OW!
- DONE.
- NOW WHAT?
- NOW, WAIT.
A NEW LIFE AND A NEW BODY
BEGIN TOMORROW AT SUNRISE.
SWEET DREAMS,
BRADLEY BRINKMAN.
THIS MAY BE THE LAST
WE SEE OF THE OLD YOU.
BYE.
- BYE.
OH, WEIRD.
REALLY WEIRD.
- THAT NIGHT, I
HAD A WILD DREAM.
AT LEAST, I THOUGHT
IT WAS A DREAM.
- OH, MAN, WHAT A NIGHTMARE.
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHOSE ARM IS THIS?
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHOSE ROOM IS THIS?
STILL DREAMING.
I'M NOT DREAMING.
THIS IS REAL.
WHERE'D ALL THIS COME FROM?
OH, MY GOD.
O'BRIEN REALLY DID IT.
SHE REALLY...REALLY DID IT.
HEY, THAT'S NOT OSCAR.
MY BEST FRIEND SINCE THE
SEVENTH GRADE IS MISSING.
O'BRIEN?
O'BRIEN, WHAT THE
HELL-- CHACHKA, HI.
- YOU KNOW ME? I'D REMEMBER
MEETING YOU.
IF YOU'RE ONE OF THE
LEFTOVERS FROM LAST NIGHT,
I'M GONNA KILL MYSELF
FOR MISSING YOU.
I MEAN, IT.
- YEAH, I'M WHAT'S
LEFT OVER, ALL RIGHT.
- OH, IS BODY--I
MEAN, BRADLEY--HOME?
- BRADLEY.
NO, BRADLEY'S STILL
DREAMING, I THINK.
I MEAN, HE'S STILL HUNG
OVER FROM THE PARTY.
- OH, LOOK.
HE REDECORATED
THE WHOLE PLACE.
- YEAH.
WOW.
SHE SURE DID.
I MEAN, YES.
YES, HE DID.
WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT?
- A REAL HUNK.
I MEAN, IS THAT YOUR
NEW CAR IN THE DRIVEWAY?
- NEW CAR?
WHAT NEW CAR?
YOU MEAN, THIS CAR?
- NO.
THIS IS MY GASTROMOBILE.
- AH, IT'S INTERESTING, YES.
- THE NEW CAR IS OVER HERE.
IS IT YOURS?
- CAR OF MY DAYDREAMS.
UH, I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.
- WHO ARE YOU ANYWAY?
- I'M NOT SURE.
I MEAN, BRADLEY AND
I ARE VERY CLOSE.
LISTEN, HAVE YOU SEEN A
WOMAN ABOUT 5'9", DARK HAIR,
REALLY GORGEOUS?
- NOT YOU TOO.
- NEVER MIND.
SHE'LL TURN UP.
I HOPE.
LOOK AT THIS STUFF.
H.G. WHO IS H.G.?
NOT ONLY
WAS I NEW TO CHACHKA,
BUT EVERYTHING I NOW
OWNED WAS NEW TO ME.
HOW WE DOING, SUSIE?
"THE WHOLE PACKAGE DEAL."
O'BRIEN.
"HUNK GOLDEN?"
MY NAME IS "HUNK GOLDEN?"
I'M RICH.
WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO BRADLEY BRINKMAN?
O'BRIEN!
O'BRIEN.
- IT WAS ALL I COULD DO TO
KEEP FROM RIPPING HIS TOWEL
OFF WITH MY TEETH.
WHAT'S HIS NAME?
HE DIDN'T SAY.
- ANOTHER RENTER ASSHOLE.
- THERE HE IS NOW.
YOO-HOO!
BRADLEY'S FRIEND!
OVER HERE.
- OH, NOW, THAT'S
A PERFECT SPECIMEN.
- A MAN'S MAN-AND-A-HALF.
- PUTS YOU TWO
BOTH TO SHAME.
- YEAH, WE'LL
SEE ABOUT THAT.
- HELLO AGAIN.
I DIDN'T CATCH YOUR NAME.
- BRADLEY-- HUNK.
MY NAME IS HUNK GOLDEN.
- HUNK.
THAT SHORT FOR
HAIRDRESSER OR SOMETHING?
- UH, HUNK.
THIS IS COASTER, ALEXIS,
LAUREL AND SKEET.
- WELL, I FEEL LIKE
I KNOW YOU ALREADY.
- ISN'T HE CHARMING.
MOVING IN?
- OR MOVING ALONG?
- NO, ACTUALLY, I'M JUST
VISITING BRADLEY BRINKMAN.
- THAT SCRAWNY LITTLE WUSS?
- WELL, ACTUALLY, I'M JUST
LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY RIGHT NOW.
- WELL,
WHAT'S THE HURRY, MURRAY?
JUST SO HAPPENS WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A FOURTH FOR V-BALL.
- YOU DO KNOW HOW TO
PLAY V-BALL, DON'T YOU?
- UH, YEAH.
SOMEBODY GAVE ME A
FEW LESSONS ... ONCE.
- GO, HUNK!
- OH, I HOPE THIS
IS GONNA BE GOOD.
- ALL RIGHT!
GREAT.
- GO, HUNK! GO!
- YOU CAN SERVE, CAN'T YOU?
- YEAH.
MIND IF I PRACTICE FIRST?
- HEY, GARDENER.
YOU AND ME.
ONE ON ONE.
HOPE YOU CAN HANDLE
A GOOD SPIKE.
- GOOD LUCK.
- YEAH.
- COME ON.
GET IT UP, GORGEOUS.
- GO, HUNK.
KILL HIM, HUNK.
- I'M GONNA WRAP YOUR
NUTS AROUND YOUR NECK,
TWINKIE DICK.
- NO, SKEET.
NO!
- SKEET, DON'T DAMAGE
THE MERCHANDISE.
- SKEET, ENOUGH'S ENOUGH.
- GO, HUNK.
- OUT COLD.
- FAIR FIGHT.
HE'S MY BEST FRIEND, BUT
HE CAN REALLY ROAR LIKE AN
ASSHOLE SOMETIMES.
- WHERE'D YOU
GET THAT WALLOP?
- THAT'S WHAT
I'D LIKE TO KNOW.
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
THREW THIS TOGETHER
IN FIVE MINUTES' NOTICE, HUNK.
- WHAT A HOST.
- ODDS AND ENDS
FROM THE FRIDGE.
- ODDS AND END FOR 40.
IMPRESSIVE.
- WHERE'S BRADLEY?
- BRADLEY, HE'S DOWNTOWN.
BIG FAMILY EMERGENCY.
- FIGURES.
- I WANT A WORD WITH
YOU, MR. HUNK GOLDEN.
- THE LAST TIME SHE HAD
A WORD WITH SOMEBODY,
HE COULDN'T TALK FOR A WEEK.
WANT A CRACKER?
- I'M NOT EATING.
- WHY NOT, BUBBY?
- I'M FAT.
- YOU'RE NOT FAT.
- OH, YOU ARE NOT FAT.
YOU'RE A BEAUTIFUL GAZELLE.
- I'M HUGE.
- YOU'RE NOT HUGE.
- YOU ARE NOT.
- YOU'RE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
THING IN THE WORLD.
- I'M A BEACHED WHALE.
- YOU'RE NOT A BEACHED WHALE.
- I'M REALLY
SORRY ABOUT SKEET.
I DON'T KNOW MY
OWN STRENGTH.
HOW IS HE?
- UNCONSCIOUS UNDER
A 20-POUND ICE PACK.
YOU ANIMAL.
- I'M AN ANIMAL?
- I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
SO SAVAGE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
- DO I KNOW?
I JUST MET MYSELF FOR
THE FIRST TIME TODAY.
- YOU KNOW WHAT SOMEBODY
OUGHT TO DO TO A BRUTAL
BASTARD LIKE YOU?
- UH, NO.
- SOMEBODY SHOULD THANK YOU
FOR PUTTING THAT BIG LUMMOX
IN HIS PLACE.
YOU'RE A WALKING A
CHUCK NORRIS MOVIE,
AND I'M NOT WAITING TILL
YOU'RE OUT ON VIDEOCASSETTE!
- UH, IN CASE YOU
HAVEN'T NOTICED,
THIS HOUSE IS
FULL OF GUESTS.
- AND ALL THE WOMEN
WANNA TAKE YOU SOUTH OF THE
MASON-DIXON LINE.
- THINGS LIKE THIS NEVER
HAPPEN TO BRADLEY BRINKMAN.
- WELL, WHY WORRY ABOUT THAT
LITTLE OLD TADPOLE WHEN WE
GOT A BIGGER FISH TO FRY?
- WHERE'D YOU LEARN
TO JOCKEY THIS BED?
- DALLAS GENERAL HOSPITAL.
BEFORE BECOMING AN
ANNIHILATOR CHEERLEADER,
I WAS STRIPPED OF
MY CANDY STRIPES.
- WELL, ONCE A CANDY-STRIPER,
ALWAYS A CANDY-STRIPER.
THAT'S WHAT I SAY.
- YOU WANNA SEE MY STRIPES?
OKAY!
THEY'RE INVISIBLE.
- OH, I CAN SEE
'EM JUST FINE.
- WHOO!
OH-OH-OH!
- OH-OH-OH-OH-OH-OH-OH-OH!
- WHOO!
WHOO!
AH! AH! AH! AH! AH!
WHOO!
- OH! OH! OH!
- WHOO!
- AH AH AH!
- WHOO!
- WHAT A DIFFERENCE
A DAY MAKES.
- IT'S ABOUT TIME.
WHERE IS BRADLEY BRINKMAN?
- YOU'RE STILL
BRADLEY INSIDE.
ONLY NOW, YOU'RE
GETTING RESULTS.
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE SOME
GORGEOUS KOOK, NOT SATANA,
QUEEN OF DARKNESS.
- WILL YOU RELAX?
ENJOY LIVING IN THIS GORGEOUS
NEW CHASSIS FOR A WHILE.
- YOU KNOW, I DRANK
EIGHT MARTINIS.
I'M NOT EVEN HUNG OVER.
- THAT'S NOTHING.
TOMORROW, WE BEGIN
NEW BODY ORIENTATION.
ARE YOU GONNA BE SURPRISED.
- WHAT ABOUT MY OLD BODY?
- THE TRIAL OFFER EXPIRES
THE MIDNIGHT AFTER LABOR DAY,
BUT YOU'LL
NEVER GO BACK.
NOBODY DOES.
TRUST ME.
I DESIGNED YOU MYSELF.
YOU'VE GOT THE THIGHS
OF SYLVESTER STALLONE,
THE PELVIS OF ELVIS PRESLEY,
THE NAVEL OF ARNOLD
SCHWARZENEGGER,
THE NIPPLES OF ROBERT REDFORD,
THE EYES OF PAUL NEWMAN, AND
THE SCHLONG OF KING KONG.
I GAVE YOU PERMA-FIRM FLESH,
WRINKLE-PROOF PERMA-TAN SKIN,
UNFRIZZABLE HAIR,
UNBREAKABLE BONES,
SELF-CLEANING CAVITY-PROOF
TEETH, ODORLESS SWEAT.
WHEN YOU DIE, YOUR SOUL
LIVES ON IN HELL IN HUNK FORM
FOR ETERNITY.
GORGE YOURSELF ON THE MOST
FATTENING FOOD
IN ALL CREATION AND
NEVER GAIN WEIGHT.
CHUG 12 TIMES THE ALCOHOL
CAPACITY OF A PERSON
TWICE YOUR SIZE.
YOUR LIVER WAS DESIGNED
BY DEAN MARTIN.
AND TO PROTECT OUR
EVIL INVESTMENT,
YOU'RE A NATURAL
MARTIAL ARTS MASTER.
JUST ASK SKEET.
LET'S NOT FORGET WHY
WE PACKAGED YOU SO STUNNINGLY--
WOMEN.
YOU'LL BE A MOVING TARGET
FROM NOW ON FOR ANYONE WHO
LOVES LUSCIOUS-LOOKING MEN.
YOU'RE BOUND TO OVERDO THE
SUPER-STUD BIT AT FIRST,
BUT YOU'LL KNOW WHEN
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
WORSHIP THY WHEELS.
A HUNK IS NAKED
WITHOUT HIS CAR.
AND DO EVERYTHING FIRST.
A HUNK SETS TRENDS.
UNDERDRESS TO IMPRESS.
A HUNK LOOKS HIS BEST WHEN
HE LOOKS LIKE HE DOESN'T
CARE HOW HE LOOKS.
- THAT IS THE MOST
INCREDIBLE, RIDICULOUS,
PREPOSTEROUS STORY
I HAVE EVER HEARD.
- BUT IT'S TRUE.
- YOU REALIZE I JUST
TAPED YOUR ENTIRE SESSION,
AND ON THE BASIS
OF THAT ALONE,
I COULD HAVE YOU HELD FOR
OBSERVATION AT ANY MENTAL
WARD IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY,
BUT THAT'S WHAT FASCINATES ME.
YOU SOUND DELUDED, BUT
SOMETHING INSIDE ME TELLS ME
YOU'RE NOT.
- YEAH, WELL THE ME
INSIDE ME KNOWS I'M NOT.
I MEAN, WHAT IF SHE HAS A
DEMONIC WHIM AND TURNS ME
INTO A HAMSTER?
OR A HIGH SCHOOL
DRIVER'S ED INSTRUCTOR?
- DON'T PANIC, HUNK.
DO I BELIEVE YOU?
NO.
CAN I HELP YOU TO HELP YOURSELF?
MAYBE.
- ALL RIGHT.
WHERE DO I START?
- WELL, YOU SAY YOU'RE
BRADLEY BRINKMAN,
AND THAT BRADLEY BRINKMAN'S
DREAM IS TO BECOME A HUNK,
RIGHT?
- RIGHT.
- SO BE A HUNK.
I MEAN, THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH THAT WHILE WE'RE
GETTING TO THE REAL
ROOT OF YOUR PROBLEM.
- YOU KNOW, MAYBE IF YOU
COULD MEET O'BRIEN
THAT WOULD PROVE EVERYTHING.
- I DOUBT WHETHER O'BRIEN OR
BRADLEY BRINKMAN EXIST
OUTSIDE OF YOUR IMAGINATION.
SO UNTIL OUR NEXT SESSION,
JUST LIGHTEN UP.
THERE ARE WORSE FATES THAN
BEING A DROP DEAD GORGEOUS GUY
WITH A PAD AT
THE BEACH, YOU KNOW.
- YOU KNOW SOMETHING, DOCTOR?
YOU'RE RIGHT.
- MY CLIENTS AND MY
FRIENDS CALL ME SUNNY.
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK
AFTER I POWDER MY NOSE.
- YOU PROMISE.
- MM-HMM.
- WHOA.
CHICKY, CHICKY, CHICKY
DEAR OF THE SEA,
WON'T YOU TALK TO ME?
AWW, COME ON, BABE.
SAVE THAT COLD FISH STUFF
FOR ALL THESE NERDS AND
"TUNA" IN TO ME, SUSHI TAIL.
WHAT'S WRONG?
HAS CATFISH GOT
YOUR TONGUE, HUH?
- BABE!
- OOPS.
GOTTA GO.
BUT I JUST LOVE RAW FISH.
- WAS BIGGSY-WIGGSY A GOOD
WITTLE BOY WHILE MOMMY
POWDERED HER NOSY-WOSY?
- THE GOODEST.
- I'LL BET.
- EXCUSE ME.
HEY, MARTY, HOW ABOUT A CAMPARI
WITH A SPLASH OF ORANGE?
- SINCE SHE TOLD ME--
- SO HOW WAS THE
CATCH OF THE DAY?
- AH, PRETTY FRESH.
- "PRETTY FRESH"?
HEY, I PROMISED YOU PARADISE,
AND I DELIVERED.
- I KNOW, I KNOW.
A LIFE OF EARTHLY PLEASURE
IN EXCHANGE FOR AN AFTERLIFE
OF THE INTERNAL INFERNAL GOD OF
HELLFIRE AND STAPH, RIGHT?
- SOMEBODY MENTION ME?
- HUNK, MEET THE CHAIRMAN
OF THE BOARD
OF THE DEVIL HIMSELF,
INCORPORATED--DR. D.,
THE DEVIL HIMSELF.
- THE DEVIL IS A DOCTOR?
- A DOCTOR OF DEATH, SWORN
TO THE HYPOCRITIC OATH--
TO TAKE LIFE WHENEVER POSSIBLE.
- WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU LOOK JUST LIKE THE GUY
THAT USED TO OWN THIS HOUSE.
THAT CAPTAIN CRABIT GUY.
- OH, I LOOK LIKE MANY DIFFERENT
PEOPLE THROUGHOUT HISTORY.
ALL OF THEM ROTTEN.
- WELL, YOU DRESS
LIKE GENGHIS KHAN.
- ATTILA THE HUN.
WE'RE SACKING
ROME IN 451 A.D.
ACTUALLY, I JUST POPPED
IN FOR A COKE CLASSIC.
- WHO'S SHE?
- CHINCHILLIA.
A LITTLE ROMAN SLAVE GIRL
I RESCUED
TO KEEP ME WARM AT NIGHT.
SHE ONLY SPEAKS
LATIN, I'M AFRAID.
"E PLURIBUS UNUM," MY DEAR.
- WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A
MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE.
451 A.D.?
THAT'S 15 CENTURIES AGO.
- WELL, IF HISTORY'S
GONNA REPEAT ITSELF,
I HAVE TO KEEP EVIL GOING
IN THE PAST AS WELL AS THE
PRESENT AND FUTURE.
THIS IS THE WORST DEMON
POWER SHORTAGE WE'VE HAD
SINCE EVERYONE WENT HOLY
FOR THOSE BLASTED CRUSADES.
THAT'S WHY I WANT YOU.
- ME?
- YES. YOU.
IN ANOTHER 50 YEARS, YOU'LL
BE ASSISTING ALL THE BIGGIES
OF BADNESS--IVAN THE
TERRIBLE, JACK THE RIPPER,
BENITO MUSSOLINI, AND FIRST
DIBS ON DELECTABLE FRINGE
BENEFITS TOO, MY BOY.
NOW, O'BRIEN, IF YOU
NEED ME ON MONDAY,
I WILL BE AT THE
FRENCH REVOLUTION,
BEHEADING AMBASSADORS.
TUESDAY, CHAMPAGNE WITH
CAIN FOR KILLING ABEL.
WEDNESDAY NIGHT, POLO WITH THE
FOUR HORSEMEN OF THE APOCALYPSE.
THURSDAY, THE
1906 SAN FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE.
WHAT A BLAST THAT WAS.
FRI--OH, FRIDAY, I SINK
ATLANTIS FOR THE WEEKEND.
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT.
- WHAT, WHAT, WHAT
HAPPENS TO HER?
- OH, I'LL PROBABLY KILL HER
IN THE TROJAN WAR
OR TURN HER INTO A HULA-HOOP
IN THE 1950s.
I HAVEN'T DECIDED WHICH YET.
- KILL HER?
- YOU'RE RIGHT,
I'LL KILL HER.
A HULA-HOOP IS TOO CRUEL.
EVEN FOR ME.
- NO, NO, I DIDN'T MEAN
"TO KILL HER." NO.
- DON'T BE SO
SQUEAMISH, MY BOY.
THERE ARE VICTIMS
ALL THROUGH HISTORY.
MY VICTIMS.
O'BRIEN'S VICTIMS.
AND SOON, YOUR VICTIMS.
- BODY COUNT IS THE BOTTOM
LINE IN OUR BUSINESS.
- THIS IS BEGINNING TO SOUND
LIKE A HORROR FILM HERE,
O'BRIEN.
- OH, I ALWAYS SAY,
"ART IMITATES DEATH."
BYE-BYE, HAPPY HUNK GOLDEN.
I'LL MEET YOU BACK HERE
MIDNIGHT AFTER LABOR DAY
TO CLOSE THE DEAL.
WE'LL BE EXPECTING
APPALLING, HORRIFYING,
HORRIBLE, GHASTLY
THINGS FROM YOU.
CIAO, BABY.
- I ASSIST IVAN
THE TERRIBLE?
- IT'S NO BIGGIE.
SO EVERY FEW CENTURIES YOU
RE-PERPETUATE EVIL
SOMEWHERE IN HISTORY.
- OH, A TIME-TRAVELLING SATANIC
SALESPERSON, LIKE YOU.
- RIGHT.
THEN WE CAN BE
TOGETHER FOREVER.
THINK OF IT.
DECEMBER 6, 1941.
WE HIT TOKYO TO SCARF SOME
SAKE AND SUSHI IN TIME TO
BOMB PEARL HARBOR
ON DECEMBER 7.
TALK ABOUT ROMANTIC.
- YEAH.
FINALLY MEET A
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN,
AND SHE WANTS ME TO
BOMB PEARL HARBOR.
"TALK ABOUT ROMANTIC."
- YOU MET THE DEVIL?
- EVERYTHING WAS GOING
LIKE A CHARM TOO.
JUST LIKE O'BRIEN
SAID IT WOULD.
- AND WHAT DID THE
DEVIL LOOK LIKE?
- HIS NAME IS DR. D.
HE WAS DRESSED LIKE
ATTILA THE HUN.
- ATTILA THE HUN?
- AND HIS CAPTIVE ROMAN
SLAVE GIRL WITH HIM,
NAMED CHINCHILLA
OR SOMETHING.
- WELL, SHE'LL NEVER BE
COLD WITH A NAME LIKE THAT.
- HE'S GONNA KILL HER DURING
THE TROJAN WAR OR TURN HER
INTO A HULA-HOOP
IN THE 1950s.
HE'LL DO IT TOO.
- I'M SURE HE WILL.
- GONNA TRAVEL
THROUGH TIME TOO.
- HUNK?
- YEAH.
- HAVE YOU BEEN
TAKING DRUGS?
- FOR WHAT?
I WAS FLYING HIGH ON MY OWN
TILL DR. D. SHOWED UP.
- MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE OUR
NEXT SESSION AT YOUR HOUSE.
- OH, YOU MAKE HOUSE CALLS?
- NO.
NOT NORMALLY.
BUT I THINK MAYBE SOMETHING
AT THE SEA SPRAY SETTING
MIGHT REVEAL CLUES THAT I
JUST CAN'T DISCOVER HERE.
- STILL THINK I'M
JOKING, DON'T YOU?
- NO.
I THINK YOUR PANIC IS GENUINE.
JUST NOT SO SURE
ABOUT THE SOURCE.
- IF I COULD ONLY GET YOU AND
O'BRIEN IN THE SAME ROOM.
SHE'S EXHIBIT A-PLUS.
- HOW'S TUESDAY AT TEN?
- GOOD.
DOC!
I MEAN, SUNNY.
UH, COME IN.
I HAD A LATE NIGHT.
- SO IT SEEMS.
- AIR DEUTSCHLAND.
THE MESSERSCHMITT SISTERS.
URSULA...
UND UMLAUT.
ICH BIN EIN BERLINER!
THEY FOLLOWED ME HOME FROM THE
7-11 AND SANG BEATLES SONGS
AT THE DOOR TO ME IN
GERMAN TILL I LET THEM IN.
- IT'S ALL PART OF OBSERVING
YOU IN YOUR
SUPERNATURAL HABITAT.
- TOUCHE.
WELL, NOW,
WHERE WERE WE, DOC?
- LET'S GET YOU
OUT IN PUBLIC.
I WANNA SEE YOUR HUNK
MAGNETISM AT WORK.
- THE BEACH.
PERFECT.
HANG ON.
HELLO?
- BRADLEY.
IT'S CONSTAPOPOLIS CALLING.
AND HOW IS DOING OUR
LITTLE GENIUS, EH?
- IT'S MY BOSS.
BRADLEY'S BOSS,
CONSTANTINE CONSTAPOPOLIS.
HELLO, MR. CONSTAPOPOLIS,
HOW ARE DEMETRA,
DEMETRIUS AND CONSTANTINE, JR.?
- IS THIS BRADLEY BRINKMAN?
- OF COURSE.
- IT DON'T SOUND
LIKE YOU, BRADLEY.
- HE DOESN'T
BELIEVE I'M BRADLEY.
- THAT MAKES TWO OF US.
YEAH, I'M GONNA HAVE TO
TRY TO DO MY OLD VOICE.
ONE MINUTE, MR. C.
DOORBELL.
UH ...
HELLO, MR. CONSTAPOPOLIS.
YES, MR. CONSTAPOPOLIS?
YOU'RE RIGHT, MR. CONSTAPOPOLIS.
GOT IT.
[as Bradley]
THANKS FOR THE BAKLAVA.
EVERYTHING WAS FANTASTIC.
- THAT'S MY BRADLEY.
SO HAVE YOU WRITTEN
PROGRAM X YET?
NO, DON'T TELL ME.
DON'T TELL ME.
I'LL WAIT TILL YOU COME
BACK AFTER LABOR DAY, HUH?
HUH?
- PROGRAM X.
LABOR DAY.
UH, RIGHT.
EVERYTHING IS COMING
ALONG JUST FINE.
- OH, LISTEN, THE
DISTRIBUTORS NEED IT BY
NOVEMBER, SO YOU MUST
DELIVER IT AFTER LABOR DAY.
NO PRESSURE, OF COURSE.
- NO SWEAT.
NO PRESSURE AT ALL. RIGHT.
COMING UP RIGHT AFTER LABOR DAY.
- GOOD, GOOD. TELL ME, BRADLEY--
WHAT IS IT? HMM?
GIVE ME A HINT.
JUST A LITTLE HINT.
JUST A TINY, LITTLE HINT.
JUST A--NO, NO, DON'T TELL ME.
NO. JUST A LITTLE.
COME ON.
- AND RUIN THE SURPRISE?
- "AND RUIN THE SURPRISE."
YOU'RE A GENIUS.
A GENIUS, YOU HEAR ME?
BRADLEY, I KISS YOU. MWAH!
"AND RUIN THE SURPRISE."
- HI, GARRISON GAYLORD HERE.
THIS WEEK ON "FILTHY RICH,"
WE SCAMPER ALONG THE SLEEK,
CHIC, SUNNY SHORES OF THE
GREEK ISLAND OF IMPHAL,
A MILLIONAIRE'S PARADISE.
- CUT!
- WHAT?
- NUMBER ONE, GARRISON,
YOUR FLY IS OPEN.
- OH.
- AND TWO, LAST
WEEK WAS IPINO.
THIS WEEK WE'RE
IN SEA SPRAY,
HOME OF THE POLAR ICE
CAP YOU'RE DRINKING.
- ALL RIGHT, ALL
RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY.
- I'VE GOT IT NOW.
- YOU'VE GOT IT NOW.
- YES.
- YES.
- I'VE GOT IT.
- OKAY, LET'S TAKE TWO.
- I CAN'T BELIEVE I FORGOT ALL
ABOUT THAT NEW PROGRAM I WAS--
I MEAN, BRADLEY
WAS SUPPOSED TO WRITE.
- DO YOU SEE HOW
THIS OBSESSION
WITH AN IMAGINARY PERSONALITY
TORMENTS YOU?
LET IT GO.
- SUNNY, BRADLEY
IS NOT IMAGINARY.
- I'M READY.
- ROLL TAPE.
- "FILTHY RICH."
TAKE 12.
- AH. HI, GARRISON GAYLORD HERE.
THIS WEEK ON "FILTHY RICH,"
WE SCAMPER ALONG THE SLEEK,
CHIC, SUNNY SHORES
OF SEA SPRAY,
HOME OF THE POLAR ICE CAP I AM
DRINKING.
OH...
- OH, NO.
NOT AGAIN, GARRISON.
- IT WAS THE SAME BLINKING
THING I DID IN MONACO.
- NO, IN MONACO, YOU SET THE
DUCHESS OF DUNGLEMORE'S WIG
ON FIRE.
DO YOU REMEMBER?
- NYET.
- I DO.
THAT'S OUR BREAK, EVERYBODY.
CUT!
GET HIM INTO WARDROBE.
- ALL MY WARDROBE IS
BACK IN MY MOTEL ROOM,
SO THAT YOUR WARDROBE PERSON
WON'T STARCH MY COLLARS
INTO CARDBOARD.
- OH, NOW HE'S WALKING--
WHERE'S HE GOING?
- ALL RIGHT. THE NEXT SHOT
IS AT THE END OF THE PIER.
- WE HAVE NO PROOF THAT
ANY AFTERLIFE
OR AFTER-DEATH EXISTS.
- I'M PROOF, SUNNY.
- MORTALITY MEANS LIVING WHO YOU
ARE AND LOVING WHO YOU ARE
RIGHT NOW.
HOW ELSE CAN
ANYONE LOVE YOU?
- I'M SORRY.
- HEY, WASN'T THAT
GARRISON GAYLORD?
- I DON'T KNOW.
- HUH.
- ANYWAY, WHAT I WAS
GOING TO SAY--
- OH, MY BLEEDING
DRIVER'S NEVER HERE.
I'LL DO IT MYSELF.
OW!
OH!
- OH!
HERE COMES GARRISON. HE'S IN
REVERSE AND OUT OF CONTROL.
- IF HE KILLS
HIMSELF ON CAMERA,
THE RATINGS ARE
GOING TO SOAR.
- YOU WANT IT?
YOU SHOOT IT.
- WATCH OUT!
- THERE IS A DARK
POWER, SUNNY.
I'LL PROVE IT
TO YOU SOMEHOW.
- HEY, YOU TWO, WATCH OUT!
- WHOO-HA-HA!
OH, I GOT THE
WHOLE THING ON TAPE!
BABY!
- THAT WAS ONE OF THE MOST
ASTONISHING FEATS I HAVE
EVER SEEN.
- HEY, CONGRATULATIONS, GUY.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE A HERO.
- A SUPERHERO.
YOU SAVED US ALL.
- NEED ANY MORE
PROOF, SUNNY?
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
- HUNK.
HUNK GOLDEN.
- OH, "THE INCREDIBLE HUNK."
I CAN'T BEAR IT.
YOU TWO MARRIED?
- UH, NO.
I'M HIS PSYCHOLOGIST, ACTUALLY.
- OH, EVEN BETTER.
- WHAT AN EXCLUSIVE.
- PUMPING THAT MUCH
ADRENALINE MAKES
ANY MAN A SUPERMAN.
- ADRENALINE
WON'T STOP A JEEP.
- YOU JUST SAVED MY LIFE.
LOOK FOR YOUR
ANSWERS IN THAT.
HUNK GOLDEN IS A HERO
FOR A VERY GOOD REASON.
LOOK, THE MESSAGE IS SIMPLE--
THE WORLD NEEDS YOU.
THE WORLD NEEDS TO BELIEVE
IN SOMEONE
WHO RISES ABOVE THE ORDINARY.
AND THAT SOMEONE IS YOU.
- I'D REALLY GO MAD
WITHOUT YOU, SUNNY.
I'D BETTER GO. U.C.L.A.
IS RUNNING SOME MORE TESTS.
- YEAH.
THANK YOU FOR SAVING MY LIFE.
SAME TIME TUESDAY?
- YEAH.
MAKE ME FEEL LIKE
YOUR ONLY CLIENT.
- I TRY TO MAKE THEM
ALL FEEL LIKE THAT.
- YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
- NO.
WE CAN'T.
I CAN'T HELP YOU LIKE THIS.
YOU'RE A VERY
ATTRACTIVE MAN.
INSIDE.
NOT JUST OUTSIDE.
WE BETTER--
- WAIT AND SEE.
- YEAH.
- SEE YOU TUESDAY.
- THINK YOU HOOKED HIM?
- THE CHEAP STUNT
WAS THE CLINCHER.
- HE'S A BRIGHT BOY.
THE KIND I NEED TO
START WORLD WAR III.
THERE'S JUST ONE
TEENSY LITTLE PROBLEM.
- AND WHAT'S THAT?
- YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH
ANOTHER ONE, O'BRIEN.
- I AM NOT IN
LOVE WITH HUNK.
- PROMISES, PROMISES.
YOU ALWAYS COME ON
LIKE GANGBUSTERS,
THEN YOU FALL IN LOVE
WITH THE POOR SLOB,
AND THEN YOU END UP TALKING
HIM OUT OF WHAT YOU COST ME
A FORTUNE IN SPECIAL
EFFECTS TO WOO HIM INTO.
- CAN A SORCERESS HELP IT,
IF SHE GETS EMOTIONALLY
INVOLVED WITH HER WORK?
SOUL SEDUCTION IS DRAINING.
- OH.
WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO THE BAD OLD DAYS?
LIKE WHEN YOU HAD THAT IDEA
ABOUT THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE.
A BIODEGRADABLE DEATH ZONE.
WITH GREAT FISHING.
I WAS SO PROUD OF YOU.
- I HID AL CAPONE'S SECRET
VAULTS
FROM GERALDO RIVERA,
DIDN'T I?
- THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU DID.
POOR GERALDO.
I JUST LOVED THAT.
- BESIDES, HUNK IS
FALLING RIGHT INTO LINE.
- WELL, THAT'S TRUE.
HE'S RICH.
HE'S FAMOUS.
HE'S FALLING IN LOVE.
HE'LL NEVER WANT TO
CHANGE BACK AGAIN NOW.
NOW, THAT HE FELL IN
LOVE WITH YOU, DOCTOR.
- HUNK'S OURS.
I THINK.
- YOU THINK?
YOU THINK?
I WARNED YOU ABOUT
THESE TRIAL OFFERS.
YOUR DEAL EXPIRES THE
DAY AFTER LABOR DAY TOO,
YOU KNOW, O'BRIEN.
DON'T FORGET THAT.
ANOTHER FAILURE, AND I'LL
HAVE TO TURN YOU BACK INTO--
- NO.
NOT THAT.
LOOK, JUST GIVE ME ANOTHER YEAR.
ANOTHER SIX MONTHS.
- OH, LOOK AT YOU.
LOVE. YOU REEK OF IT.
- YOU OWE ME A
SOUL A CENTURY.
YOU ARE 0 FOR 99 YEARS.
NO SOUL, NO DEAL.
NO DEAL, NO O'BRIEN.
- OKAY.
LOOK, I MAKE HUNK FALL IN
LOVE WITH SUNNY--
- AND NOT VICE VERSA.
- NOT VICE VERSA.
AND SUNNY CONVINCES
HIM TO KEEP THE DEAL,
AND THEN WHAT
HAPPENS TO SUNNY?
- SUNNY?
WHY SUNNY?
SUNNY?
THE TUESDAY AFTER LABOR
DAY, SUNNY DISAPPEARS.
HE NEVER SEES HER AGAIN.
- OH, HUNK WILL
BE HEARTBROKEN.
- OH, IF YOU'RE NOT IN LOVE
WITH HIM, IT WON'T MATTER,
WILL IT?
- IF HE EVER FINDS OUT,
HE'S GONNA HATE ME FOREVER.
- WELL, THAT
CAN BE ARRANGED.
I'LL BE WATCHING
YOU, O'BRIEN.
HEIL HITLER.
I WISH I NEVER INVENTED
THAT CLICKING BUSINESS.
CIAO, SWEETHEART.
- GARRISON GAYLORD HERE.
TWO WEEKS AGO
ON "FILTHY RICH,"
WE SHOWED YOU A REAL
LIVE ACT OF SUPERHEROISM.
AS IT UNFOLDED RIGHT
BEFORE OUR CAMERAS.
IN THE TWO WEEKS SINCE,
HUNK GOLDEN,
THE SUPERMAN WHO
SAVED MY LIFE,
HAS BECOME THE STUFF
OF AMERICAN LEGEND.
A "FILTHY RICH" CAMERA CREW
AND I SHARED IT WITH HIM.
"HUNKMANIA" IS SWEEPING
SEA SPRAY
AND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY.
HUNK WANNABES CAMP AROUND
HIS HOME 24 HOURS,
DESPERATE FOR JUST A LOOK AT
THE HUNK HIMSELF.
HUNK'S SPORT COAT IS
THE BRAND-NEW LOOK,
THE FASHION LOOK
OF THE 1980s.
PROMOTIONAL OFFERS HAVE BEEN
FLOODING IN SINCE DAY ONE.
FROM DESIGNER
JEANS TO DOG FOOD,
FROM HEALTH CLUBS
TO HEMORRHOIDS,
HUNK'S NAME IS
INDEED GOLDEN.
THREE MILLION TO BE
THE NEW JAMES BOND.
FOUR MILLION TO LOSE
TO STALLONE IN ROCKY V.
PLAYBOY WANTS HIM.
PLAYGIRL WANTS HIM.
METEORIC FAME HAS
ALREADY FORCED HUNK INTO
SELF-IMPOSED SECLUSION.
CONSTANTLY AT HIS SIDE
THROUGHOUT THE DIZZYING SIEGE
IS LOS ANGELES PSYCHOLOGIST
SUSAN "SUNNY" GRAVES
WHO HE RESCUED.
ARE THEY IN
ROMANTIC CAHOOTS?
WILL SUCCESS
SPOIL HUNK GOLDEN?
CLOSE FRIENDS SAY
HE'S CHANGED ALREADY.
- U.P.I., SHMOO-P.I.,
I THINK I HEAR A.P. CALLING.
HUNK GOLDEN.
YEAH, YEAH, HUNK-BURGER
FRANCHISES. NO, I'M SORRY.
I'M SOLD OUT TILL 1992.
UGH.
HUNK GOLDEN.
YEAH.
YES, SENATOR.
NO, I'VE ALREADY BEEN ASKED
TO BE PUT ON
THE STATE FLAG OF HAWAII, BUT--
- HUNH! HUH!
- CAN YOU HANG A SECOND,
SENATOR?
HI. AGGRESSIVE LITTLE
THING, AREN'T YOU?
THERE YOU GO.
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS
DROPPING IN.
NO, SENATOR, I COULDN'T
PICK A FAVORITE STATE.
OF COURSE, IF YOU'D LIKE TO
SPONSOR A BILL PUTTING ME ON
THE AMERICAN FLAG, I'D
HAVE NO OBJECTIONS.
GOD DAMN IT, SUNNY!
THESE PEOPLE ARE JUST
LIKE A BUNCH OF PIRANHA!
BITE, BITE, BITE.
- HUNK, COME ON. JUST--
- SUNNY,
I'VE HAD IT OKAY.
WATCH THIS.
WAITING FOR SOMETHING
MORE GOLDEN?
WELL, HERE IT IS--A
PERSON-TO-PERSON MESSAGE.
STAY THE HELL
AWAY FROM HERE!
TAKE THAT, FAT BOY.
- STOP IT, HUNK.
THAT'S NOT FUNNY. HUNK, STOP IT.
HUNK, DO YOU WANT TO BE ON THE
SIX O'CLOCK NEWS DOING THIS?
- SURE, I DO.
I LOVE THE PUBLICITY, HONEY.
- GIVE ME THIS.
GIVE IT TO ME.
- FINE.
JUST FINE.
- YOU CAN'T LET IT
GET TO YOU LIKE THIS.
- I'M STARTING TO FEEL
DIFFERENT INSIDE.
ALMOST LIKE A DEMON.
- DEMONS DON'T EXIST.
JUST PEOPLE AND PRESSURES.
- YOU KNOW YOU'VE MADE IT WHEN
YOUR GARBAGE IS FRONT PAGE NEWS.
EXTRA! HUNK TOSSES LEAN CUISINE,
CAPPUCCINO GROUNDS
AND A PINT OF PRALINE TOFUTTI.
READ ALL ABOUT IT!
- IT WON'T ALWAYS
BE LIKE THIS.
YOU WON'T ALWAYS LIVE
UNDER THE MEDIA MICROSCOPE.
YOU'LL COOL OFF, AND THEN
WE'LL HAVE--
AND THEN YOU'LL HAVE YOUR
PRIVACY AGAIN.
- YOU CAN SAY "WE."
WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER.
- AND AFTER LABOR DAY TOMORROW,
WE'LL BE OUT OF IT TOGETHER.
YOU'LL FINALLY BE HUNK
GOLDEN IN YOUR OWN MIND.
- KINDA LIKE BEING IN IT
TOGETHER
WITH SOMEONE LIKE YOU.
- SO DO I.
BUT THERE ARE BETTER THINGS
TO BE IN TOGETHER THAN THIS,
YOU KNOW.
- THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.
- HUNK, WAKE UP, IT'S ME.
YOUR OLD BODY?
THE BODY YOU'RE ON
VACATION FROM, REMEMBER?
- WHERE THE HELL
HAVE YOU BEEN?
- EXACTLY.
HELL.
I ESCAPED WHILE THEY WERE
WATCHING
"THE POSSESSED" AND
"THE WRESTLERS."
- HANG ON JUST A MINUTE.
HEY, SUNNY.
SUNNY, WAKE UP.
BRADLEY'S HERE.
WAKE UP.
- HUNK, I DON'T
HAVE MUCH TIME.
- WHY WERE YOU IN HELL?
- WHERE ELSE ARE THEY GONNA
HOLD THIS BODY IN ESCROW
WHILE YOU DECIDE
WHO TO BOFF NEXT?
- THAT'S NOT FAIR.
- WHAT A SLEAZEBAG
YOU'VE BECOME.
HOSING DOWN INNOCENT FANS.
- HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?
- HOW'D I KNOW THAT?
YOU'RE RUNNING AS A
MINI-SERIES ON DEMON TV.
KILLER RATINGS.
AND EVERYONE DOWN THERE'S
RIPPING OFF THEIR COATCOAT
SLEEVESSLEEVES.
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
HAPPENING TO ME?
- THE HELL YOU DON'T.
EVIL HAS TAKEN
ROOT IN YOUR SOUL.
AND IT USED TO BE
SUCH A NICE SOUL.
LONELY, BUT NICE.
- IT'S THEM.
IT'S THEM!
I CAME TO WARN YOU.
DR. D. IS FOR REAL
AND SO IS HELL.
HUNK, I KNOW YOU
CAN FEEL IT ALREADY.
- HEY, SUNNY. SUNNY. YOU'RE
MISSING IT. WAKE UP. WAKE UP.
- FORGET ABOUT HER AND
THINK ABOUT OUR FUTURE.
IT IS SLIME TIME DOWN THERE.
EX-GAME SHOW HOSTS, USED-CAR
SALESMEN, TV SPOKESMODELS.
EVEN MRS. KREPPEL.
- NO.
- YES!
MRS. KREPPEL, THAT NINTH
GRADE BIOLOGY BITCH THAT
FLUNKED US.
TWICE.
- WHAT SHOULD I DO?
- THINK. THINK IF IT'S WORTH IT.
- WHAT ABOUT SUNNY?
I'M IN LOVE WITH HER, AND IT'S
WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS WANTED.
- DON'T YOU THINK
I CAN FEEL THAT?
BUT A LIFETIME WITH HER IS A
ONE-NIGHT STAND COMPARED TO
AN ETERNITY OF EVIL.
HUNK!
I KNOW YOU. I KNOW YOU'LL MAKE
THE RIGHT DECISION.
- BRADLEY!
SUNNY'S GOTTA SEE THIS.
SUNNY, SUNNY, WAKE UP.
- WHAT IS IT?
- BRADLEY WAS JUST HERE. THEY
CAME AND CARRIED HIM
BACK TO HELL. COME ON. COME ON.
SEE FOR YOURSELF.
- I WAS IN SUCH A DEEP SLEEP.
- I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW.
LOOK, SUNNY.
- YOU WOKE ME UP TO SHOW
ME THE BEDROOM DOOR.
- NO, NO, NO. JUST A MINUTE AGO,
THESE ARMS CAME
AND PUNCHED HOLES RIGHT THROUGH
THE DOOR AND PULLED BRADLEY
RIGHT BACK THROUGH THE WOOD.
- HONEY, HONEY, YOU WERE
JUST DREAMING, OKAY?
- NO.
THEN HOW DID I GET THIS
SPLINTER IN MY FINGER, HUH?
- I DON'T KNOW.
I-I-I DON'T KNOW, HOW?
- FROM THE HOLE IN THE DOOR.
- HUNK, THE ONLY IN THIS
ROOM IS IN YOUR HEAD.
LOOK, YOU'RE JUST UPSET,
BECAUSE YOUR WHOLE BRADLEY
FANTASY SHATTERS
TO BITS TOMORROW.
- SUNNY, DON'T BE
MAD AT ME, OKAY?
- HONEY, I'M NOT MAD AT YOU.
I JUST WANT US
TO GET PAST THIS.
I WANT IT TO BE THE TWO OF
US, NOT THE THREE OF US.
- LOOK, YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE
THE BEST THING THAT
EVER HAPPENED TO ME, RIGHT?
- WHY DON'T WE SHOWER AND
GO HAVE SOME BREAKFAST, HUH?
- YEAH. YEAH.
I'LL JOIN YOU IN A SECOND.
- GOOD.
- GET IN.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- I WAS SWIMMING KOSHER HOT DOGS
FROM MIAMI TO HAVANA FOR FIDEL
DURING THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS
WHEN BRINKMAN ESCAPED.
- SPIRITUAL
SEPARATION ANXIETY.
HIS GOOD HALF IS SO STRONG.
- YES, SO DON'T WIMP OUT.
GOOD MOVE SUGGESTING
BREAKFAST.
BUT LISTEN, DON'T LET HIM
SLEEP BEFORE MIDNIGHT.
- HE'S STILL TIPPED
IN OUR DIRECTION.
- YES, BUT ONE MORE SILLY,
SAPPY, SENTIMENTAL DREAM,
AND HE'LL BACK OUT
AT THE LAST SECOND.
- TALKING TO ME, HONEY?
- [as Sonny] I'M SINGING IN
THE SHOWER, DEAR!
NOW LISTEN, KEEP HIM
AWAKE, AND HE'S OURS.
- RIGHT.
- WELL, THAT DIDN'T
SOUND LIKE SINGING TO ME.
- THEN YOU
WEREN'T LISTENING.
I LOVE YOU.
- GREAT BREAKFAST.
- MM-HMM.
- SWEETHEART, I'M STILL A
LITTLE JANGLED
FROM BRADLEY LAST NIGHT.
MIND IF I TAKE A NAP.
- MM-MM. I THINK A NAP'S
A GOOD IDEA.
YOU WANT TO BE IN TIP-TOP
SHAPE WHEN THEY PRESENT YOU
WITH THE KEY TO SEA SPRAY
AT THE CLUB TONIGHT.
- RIGHT.
- SWEET DREAMS.
BYE, HUNK!
- HELLO?
HELLO?
HELLO?
HELLO?
- HI.
- HI.
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR NAP?
- SABOTAGED.
AFTER YOU LEFT, EVERY
APPLIANCE IN THE HOUSE
TURNED ITSELF ON.
I COULDN'T TURN 'EM OFF.
I MEAN, DON'T YOU HEAR IT?
- HEAR WHAT?
- IT STOPPED.
- HUNK, ARE YOU
HAVING ANOTHER DREAM?
- NO, NO, NOW, SUNNY,
SUNNY, I--I--NEVER,
NEVER, NEVER WENT TO SLEEP.
TEN MINUTES AGO, THEY WERE ALL
RUNNING WITHOUT ELECTRICITY.
- HUNK, NOTHING RUNS
WITHOUT ELECTRICITY.
- YEAH.
- YOU STILL HAVEN'T WRITTEN
YOUR ACCEPTANCE SPEECH FOR
THE BANQUET TONIGHT, SO WHY
DON'T--
- SUNNY, SUNNY, FORGET ABOUT THE
BANQUET.
YOU'RE MEETING THE DEVIL
TONIGHT AT MIDNIGHT.
- SETTLE DOWN.
- MAYBE O'BRIEN TOO.
- ALL RIGHT.
SUPPOSE I DO MEET THE
DEVIL, WHO YOU GONNA CHOOSE?
ME OR BRADLEY?
- I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, SUNNY.
I STILL DON'T KNOW.
- LET'S GET A SHOT
OF US SHAKING HANDS.
- WHY NOT?
- WHAT TIME IS IT?
- IT'S TWO MINUTES LATER THAN
THE LAST TIME YOU ASKED ME.
IT'S 10:32.
- WE HAVE TO MEET DR. D.
AT MIDNIGHT.
I'M GONNA SLEEP TOMORROW,
NO MATTER WHO I AM.
- AND I'LL BE WITH YOU.
- NO MATTER WHO I AM?
- YOU'LL BE HUNK.
YOU'LL SEE.
- I SURE WISH O'BRIEN
COULD SEE ME
GETTING THE KEY TO THE CITY.
- I'M SURE SHE'S WATCHING.
- LOOK AT THAT [indistinct].
REMINDS ME OF THE COCKTAIL
LOUNGE ON THE LUSITANIA.
HAPPY MEMORIES.
BON APPETIT.
- ATTENTION, EVERYBODY.
IT'S AWARD TIME.
AS PRESIDENT OF THE SEA SPRAY
HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION,
IT IS MY HONOR
TO HONOR ONE OF OUR OWN.
A MAN I AM PROUD
TO CALL MY FRIEND.
WHEN HE FIRST APPEARED
HERE AT SEA SPRAY,
I REALIZED HE WAS
SOMEONE VERY SPECIAL.
AND NOW THE WORLD
KNOWS IT TOO.
- WHAT A PHONY.
- HUNK, WE'RE PRESENTING YOU
WITH THE KEY TO SEA SPRAY
TONIGHT, BUT YOU'LL NEVER HAVE
TO USE IT. WHY?
BECAUSE OUR HOMES AND HEARTS
ARE OPEN TO YOU FOREVER.
- A LITTLE BIT CORNY,
BUT THE CROWD'S WITH HIM.
WHAT DO THEY KNOW?
- HUNK GOLDEN, PLEASE STEP
FORWARD FOR THE PRESENTATION.
AND IF I MAY SAY SO, THIS KEY IS
NOTHING COMPARED TO THE LADY
WHO IS THE SUNNY SIDE IN HUNK'S
LIFE--DR. SUNNY GRAVES.
AND HERE TO PRESENT THE KEY IS
THE HONORARY MAYOR OF SEA SPRAY,
THE STAR OF AMERICA'S FAVORITE
LITE KNOCKWURST COMMERCIALS,
SKEET MECKLENBURG!
- THANK YOU.
HUNK, EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS
THAT I HATED YOU ON SIGHT,
AND WELL, I'VE GOT
TO HAND IT TO YOU,
YOU DID PUT ME IN MY PLACE.
THEY CALLED YOU A SUPERMAN
FOR DOING IT AND SOMEHOW IT
SEEMS LIKE A SUPERGUY
DESERVES MORE THAN A KEY,
DESERVES A CROWN.
- SKEET, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!
WE HAD T-SHIRT RIGHTS.
HUNK!
HUNK!
- HELL OF A SUPERMAN.
- IF THAT SKEET
SCREWS UP MY PLANS,
I'LL BRING HIM BACK
AS A WHOOPEE CUSHION.
- HUNK?
- HUNK, WAKE UP.
HUNK, YOU'VE GOT TO WAKE UP.
- WILL SOMEBODY WAKE THAT SUCKER
UP? I NEED HIM.
- HUNK, PLEASE, WAKE UP.
COME ON.
YOU'VE GOTTA WAKE UP.
- BRILLIANT STROKE, HUNK.
MAKING OUR DEVILS BRIGADE
RAID ON SEA SPRAY LOOK LIKE
AN ENEMY SNEAK ATTACK.
- I PROMISED YOU WORLD
WAR III BY DINNER TIME.
- LOOK, ALL THOSE YUPPIE SNOBS
YOU HATED ARE DEAD MEAT NOW.
- DEAD MEAT NOW.
- DID YOU KILL THEM
ALL YOURSELF?
- SHUCKS, DR. D.
- OH, DON'T BE MODEST.
- MAYBE JUST A LITTLE BIT.
MAYBE JUST A LITTLE BIT.
- CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN.
GOOD BOY.
THERE'S JUST ONE
LITTLE FORMALITY.
BEFORE YOU CAN TRULY COMMIT
YOUR SOUL TO MY WICKED WORK,
YOU MUST GET RID OF
YOUR BETTER HALF.
WE'VE ALL THE
FIXINGS RIGHT HERE.
THAT SAPPY, SENTIMENTAL
SIDE OF YOUR SOUL
MUST BE DESTROYED.
YOU READY TO SAVE
YOURSELF, BRINKMAN?
- HUNK, DON'T DO THIS TO US!
ALL EVIL AND NO PLAY
MAKES HUNK A DULL DEMON!
- READY.
- YOU'RE GONNA MISS ME!
THE GOOD THINGS ARE
WHAT LIFE'S ALL ABOUT.
YOU CAN'T WANNA BE THE GUY
WHO STARTED WORLD WAR III.
- AIM.
- ALL THIS JUST TO GET LAID
MORE AND A GUEST HOST
ON THE CARSON SHOW?
PLEASE, GIVE AN INNOCENT
BETTER HALF A BREAK. HUH?
- MY FAVORITE WORD--FIRE.
- HUNK! PLEASE! NO! DON'T!
- FIRE, FIRE, FI--
- WAIT. OH HE'S ALL RIGHT.
WAIT.
- YOU'RE ALL STILL ALIVE.
- OF COURSE,
WE'RE STILL ALIVE.
EXCEPT FOR THE PEOPLE
THAT ATE THE ROAST BEEF.
- FOR A SECOND THERE, I WAS
KILLING ALL MY-- --YOUR
INVESTMENTS GOODBYE.
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- SKEET CROWNED YOU WITH
THE KEY TO SEA SPRAY.
- YOU ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH.
WHAT TIME IS IT?
- MY WATCH STOPPED.
- IT'S TEN MINUTES
TO MIDNIGHT.
- HUNK!
- HUNK, COME ON.
ENOUGH FOR ONE DAY.
- YOU AND I HAVE AN
APPOINTMENT WITH DR. D.
- HUNK, YOU CAN HAVE A
CONCUSSION. NOW, COME ON.
- COME ON.
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.
- NOW, WAIT A MINUTE. THE KEY,
THE PRESENTATION--
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- TO THE DEVIL!
- both: OUR INVESTMENTS.
- NO WAY I'M GONNA BE THE GUY
WHO STARTED WORLD WAR III.
- HOW CAN YOU HAVE STARTED A
WAR THAT HASN'T EVEN BEGUN?
- IN THE FUTURE, IT HAS, SUNNY.
IT STARTS RIGHT
HERE IN SEA SPRAY.
- WELL, IT'S
ALMOST MIDNIGHT.
WHO ARE YOU GONNA BE
ONE MINUTE FROM NOW?
- BRADLEY BRINKMAN.
- WHAT?
- SUNNY.
SUNNY, I KNOW IF YOU TRULY
LOVE ME--THE ME INSIDE--
IT'S NOT GONNA MATTER TO YOU
IF I COME BACK JUST IN
A DIFFERENT KIND OF BODY.
- I DO LOVE YOU.
I LOVE WHAT'S INSIDE.
BUT HUNK YOU HAVE TO
ACCEPT WHO YOU ARE.
- YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES YOU
SOUND JUST LIKE O'BRIEN.
THE ONLY LIMITATION IN OUR
RELATIONSHIP IS THAT YOU
CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT
I'VE BEEN THROUGH.
WHEN YOU MEET DR. D. A FEW
SECONDS FROM NOW,
YOU WILL, THOUGH. COME ON.
TOLD YOU HE'D
BE HERE, SUNNY.
- IS THIS SOME
KIND OF TRICK?
- WISH IT WERE.
COME ON.
- OH, THERE YOU ARE.
WHILE YOU WERE AWAY, I
WHIPPED UP A FEW LITTLE
GOODIES TO CELEBRATE
OUR CLOSING OUR DEAL.
- DR. D., AT YOUR
SERVICE, SUNNY.
- AND IMPECCABLE SERVICE IT
IS TOO.
SEE? CANNIBAL CANAPES,
ALL-WHITE MEAT MISSIONARY
(NO AGNOSTIC FILLERS),
FANTASTIC TITANIC
ICEBERG LETTUCE SALAD,
KILLER TOMATOES, AND
DEVILED EGGS A LA MOI.
- THERE'S NO DEAL, DR. D.
- WHAT?
- A LIFE OF SELFISH PLEASURE
AND AN ETERNAL AFTERLIFE
AS ONE OF YOUR HENCHMEN
IS A ROTTEN EXCHANGE.
I WANT SUNNY TO MEET
O'BRIEN RIGHT NOW.
- O'BRIEN WILL BE
AROUND, ALL RIGHT,
BUT LET'S NOT TALK
ABOUT O'BRIEN.
WHY LET A FEW
DREAMS SCARE YOU,
WHEN YOU CAN BE A LIVING
NIGHTMARE YOURSELF?
- I WANNA BE BRADLEY
BRINKMAN AGAIN.
WHY CAN'T O'BRIEN
BE HERE TO SEE THIS?
- OH, SHE'LL SEE
IT, ALL RIGHT.
SO BE IT.
EXIT, HUNK GOLDEN.
ENTER, BRADLEY BRINKMAN.
- THIS IS BRADLEY BRINKMAN.
THIS IS ME.
IT HAD TO BE
THIS WAY, SUNNY.
- I KNOW.
- THE GAME IS UP FOR HER
TOO, BRADLEY BRINKMAN.
COME OUT, COME OUT,
WHEREVER YOU ARE.
- WHAT?
- OH, THE DEVIL
MADE HER DO IT.
- AND I THOUGHT
THAT YOU LOVED ME.
- I DID.
I MEAN, I DO.
BRADLEY, YOU MADE
THE RIGHT DECISION.
ALL THE DREAMS WERE TRUE.
I HAD TO LIE TO GET
YOU TO CLOSE THE DEAL.
YOU BELIEVED IN
YOUR OLD SELF MORE.
- AND I BELIEVED IN YOU.
NOW WHAT?
- DISMISSAL.
- MY DEAL'S UP TOO.
- YOUR DEAL?
- FABULOUS DEAL TILL SHE
GOT SENTIMENTAL AND SLOPPY.
- I HAD TO LAND A SOUL A CENTURY
FOR DR. D. OR LOSE MY DEAL.
- SHE HASN'T MADE A SCORE SINCE
OTTO VON BISMARCK IN 1887.
- I'M TOO MUCH A ROMANTIC
TO KEEP RECRUITING NICE GUYS
FOR THE DEVIL'S WORK.
NICE GUYS LIKE YOU.
- THEN WHY DO YOU
KEEP DOING IT?
- I WAS AFRAID.
I AM AFRAID.
TO BE THE REAL ME.
THE ONE THAT SOLD THEIR SOUL TO
DR. D. IN THE FIRST PLACE.
- WAIT A MINUTE. YOU'RE SUNNY.
OR YOU WERE.
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO TAUGHT
ME THAT PEOPLE EXIST ON THE
INSIDE, NOT ON THE OUTSIDE.
EVEN IF IT WAS TO DECEIVE ME,
THE LOVE I FELT FROM YOU
CAME FROM SOME WONDERFUL PERSON.
I THINK--
- I'M REALLY TOUCHED.
I -- VERY TOUCHING.
BUT IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I HAVE
TO CATCH AN ILL WIND TO BEIRUT.
LOOK. SINCE IT'S
HITLER'S BIRTHDAY,
I'LL MAKE YOU ONE LAST
OFFER--SIX MONTHS' EXTENSION
TO MAKE GOOD ON BEING BAD.
- NO WAY.
- SIX MONTHS?
- NO, DON'T.
WHOEVER YOU ARE OR WERE.
DON'T BE AFRAID.
THERE IS A PERSON INSIDE OF
YOU WHO IS WARM AND LOVING.
I KNOW.
I'VE FELT IT.
- O'BRIEN.
REMEMBER HOW
LONELY YOU WERE?
- CAN'T BE LONELIER THAN
RUNNING A TIME-TRAVELLING
SELL-YOUR-SOUL-TO-SATAN
SERVICE.
- WELL--
- DON'T BE AFRAID TO BE THE
PERSON WHO YOU ARE INSIDE.
- STRONG ENOUGH TO COME BACK
TO EARTH
AS YOURSELF USED TO BE?
- I WAS.
- I'M STAYING WITH--
- UNLIMITED CREDIT ON
"INFERNOCARD?"
- I'M STAYING WITH BRADLEY.
- YES!
- OH, TO HEAVEN
WITH BOTH OF YOU.
THERE ARE PLENTY OF TAKERS
ACROSS THE CENTURIES TO
CARRY OUT MY MASTER PLAN
TO MAKE ALL THE HAPPY ENDINGS IN
HISTORY
EVIL ONES.
LIKE ALL THOSE
LASSIE MOVIES.
SO BE IT.
THERE SHE IS.
PRINCESS LUCILLA OF LENINSHIRE,
JUST AS I FOUND HER IN THE
TENTH CENTURY, AFTER HER FATHER
SOLD HER TO THE VIKINGS.
NINE CENTURIES OF VICIOUS,
VILE TRAINING DOWN
THE TUBES OF TIME.
- LUCILLA.
WHY DID YOUR
FATHER SELL YOU?
- BECAUSE I WASN'T AS BEAUTIFUL
AS MY SISTER, PRINCESS KASAVA,
SO I SOLD MY SOUL
TO DR. D.
TO ESCAPE AND BECOME
BEAUTIFUL ... LIKE YOU.
- YOU'RE A PRINCESS.
- A PRINCESS WITHOUT A
CASTLE, WITHOUT A JOB.
WELL, I'LL BE GOING.
- WHOSE SIDE ARE
YOU ON THIS TIME?
- WHAT DOES IT MATTER?
AS LONG AS MANKIND
IS MISERABLE.
CIAO.
- SO YOU'VE BEEN--
- RETURNED TO EARTH TO LIVE OUT
THE REST OF MY MORTAL LIFE.
LIKE YOU.
- LIKE ME.
WHO WOULD EVER BELIEVE THIS?
- YOU WOULD, BRADLEY.
OH, MY GOODNESS BRADLEY, WHAT
ABOUT YOUR PROGRAM?
IT'S DUE TODAY.
- IT CAME TO ME LAST NIGHT
WHEN I MET THE REAL YOU.
- WHAT IS IT?
- "THE PRINCESS PROGRAM"--
HOW TO LIVE ROYALLY ON A
REGULAR WEEK'S PAY.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- WHAT DO I THINK?
BRADLEY?
- HM?
- ARE YOU
DISAPPOINTED?
- DISAPPOINTED IN WHAT?
- THAT YOU GAVE
UP THE NEW YOU,
ENDED UP WITH THE OLD ME.
WHO'S ALWAYS SECOND BEST.
- YOU'RE SECOND BEST?
NEVER.
NOT 900 YEARS AGO,
NOT NOW, NOT EVER.
- FUNNY. HUNK DISAPPEARS, AND
BRADLEY BRINKMAN RETURNS.
THEY BOTH WERE ALWAYS LOOKING
FOR THE SAME WOMAN TOO.
- AND IT LOOKS LIKE BRINKMAN
FINALLY GOT HIMSELF A GIRL.
- WHAT'D YOU EXPECT?
HUNK MUST'VE
RUBBED OFF ON HIM.
Here, Charlie. More fortune cookies.
- Good luck!
- Thanks! What?
Next week, we'll be selling
Sanyo remote control VCRs for $299!
- Look, it's Dad!
- Oh, no! I'll go broke!
To give away Mitsubishi giant-screen television sets for $1,299!
Oh, no!
We won't be undersold on microwaves, videorecorders, ovens...
- Mom, you're not looking.
- Please turn that off.
Mom, when are you going to stop being mad at Dad?
I mean, how do you think that makes me feel?
I have certain unresolved feelings about your father.
I don't trust him.
- And I hate those commercials.
- All right, forget it.
We don't have time for another heart-to-heart.
Come on. You have to get dressed.
- I want you to understand it's insulting...
- Watch your hair.
...for him to go from me to that bimbo.
Do you think he really loves Janet?
Maybe he's just smashed too many fortune cookies!
Mom, give me a break!
He's missing the reunion because of you.
You know he's dying to go.
At least we won't both have a miserable time.
Let me see.
What do you think?
You are a very hip chick!
God, you look like you've stepped right out of Life magazine!
I don't know.
What if nobody else there is dressed like this?
So?
- I don't think I wanna go.
- Mom.
Everybody's just gonna say,
"Well, hey, where's Crazy Charlie?"
Lots of people are separated and divorced.
Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
I feel ridiculous in this dress!
I'd like to change.
Why are you so nervous?
What's the matter?
Reunions do funny things to people at this age.
- Hi, Peggy Sue! Beth!
- Hi.
Hi, Maddy.
How are you?
You two look just like that soap commercial.
- "Which one's the mother?"
- "And which one's the daughter?"
You took this seriously.
You're a real blast from the past!
It was Beth's idea.
I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.
- Hi.
- Hi! Peggy Sue Bodell?
- All right.
- Mom?
Beth's boyfriend is with the band.
- Must run in the family.
- What does?
You and your mother.
You both seem to fall for musicians.
Mom, look!
Oh, God!
It's okay. Come on. Look!
Why don't you find a table?
We'll see you in a little while.
Sure.
God, Mom, that picture's great!
Come on, let's get a table.
- Is this good?
- Fine.
- I'll be right back. You be all right?
- Sure.
Thank you. We're gonna do a little medley for you now.
- Come on, pose like your picture.
- What?
Hi, do you like it?
I figured as everyone has a gold Rolex,
I'd have one made in platinum.
- What a wonderful idea!
- How are you?
I'm fine. How many children do you have?
- I don't have any.
- You don't? I thought you did.
- No. How many do you have?
- I have four.
- Four?
- Four, yeah.
I'm so happy for you.
- I love them so much.
- How's Peggy Sue doing?
She was a mess, right after they separated.
But I think she's coming out of it.
Seems to be friendly now.
I'm so glad.
Sometimes it's easier when you hate them.
- How about a little dance, princess?
- Walter!
- How are you?
- Good.
- Nice to see you. I'll see you later.
- Yeah.
Aren't you Peggy Sue Kelcher?
I was once. Richard Norvik?
I didn't recognise you!
You look terrific.
You look exactly the same.
I feel ridiculous!
I only did this for tonight, you know.
- It's adorable.
- Thank you.
Peggy Sue Kelcher, this is my wife, Sharon.
- How nice to meet you. Why don't you sit?
- Thank you.
But call me Peggy. Peggy Bodell now.
So, where's Charlie?
I was in town about a year ago and I turn on the television...
...and I see Crazy Charlie.
It really made me laugh.
Charlie won't be here tonight.
- We're getting divorced, actually.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
Mr. Norvik!
Richard. Doug Snell, Merrill Lynch.
I read about that Codex deal in Business Week. Congratulations!
Thank you very much.
Peggy, how are you? How's Charlie?
Hey, Terry!
- Thank you, Doug, thank you very much.
- Call me.
Madeline Hutton and Arthur Nagle were high school sweethearts.
Married right after graduation, they're still together.
Maddy. Arthur. How does it feel to have missed the sexual revolution?
What? What kind of question is that?
That doesn't have anything to do with the reunion, Delores!
Take it easy, kitten.
- Welcome to the singles scene.
- I don't know how you do it.
I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
It's not that bad, really.
You just have to think of men like houses, and trade upward.
I always thought that you and Charlie had a really great marriage.
I think we did.
We just got married too young...
...and ended up blaming each other for all the things we missed.
So he started having affairs and you started getting depressed?
You just should have left here years ago, like I did.
It's not so bad.
I've got two great kids.
I've got my own business.
Still, if I knew then what I know now...
...l'd do a lot of things differently.
Your damn computers put me out of business.
You're right. He's drunk.
You're a billionaire and I'm a goddamn failure.
No, the bakery's doing very well.
- Do you manage it?
- I own it.
I remember that dress.
Rosalie?
Oh, no. I remember that locket, too.
You were so excited!
I think you showed it to the whole school.
You have an incredible memory.
- It's beautiful. Does it open?
- Yes.
- These are my children.
- They're so cute!
Of course, they're not babies anymore!
But you were married when you were three, right?
God bless you!
The best thing about being a dentist.
Pure pharmaceutical grade.
A couple of lines of this,
I could drill my own teeth.
Hi.
Hi.
- Who's the guy with the eyes?
- Michael Fitzsimmons.
I used to have such a crush on him in school.
- Peggy.
- Hi!
God, that Walter Getz can still dance!
Your first boyfriend!
Come on, tell me. Any sparks left?
Well, who knows?
I mean, remember, whatever Walter wants...
...Walter gets!
I'm sorry. Sharon Norvik.
This is Carol Heath and Maddy Nagle, my oldest and my dearest friends.
- Nice to meet you.
- Sharon is married to Richard.
- Lucky lady!
- Thank you.
Michael Fitzsimmons. Is he here?
No. No, I asked Rosalie.
She couldn't track him down.
- That's too bad.
- He must have been quite a guy.
Yeah.
You know, he is the only boy in high school
I wish I'd gone to bed with!
Only one?
Well, besides Charlie.
I hope the sales of your book go very well.
Anything anecdotal you'd like to leave us with?
Yeah, every dog has its day.
Meaning what?
Peggy, would you please rescue Richard?
Ask him to dance.
Richard. Would you like to dance?
Of course I would.
So, are we through now?
- No.
- Good.
From snivelling runt to pompous ass in 25 years.
That's quite an accomplishment.
I really cannot get over this.
The only time people like Delores Dodge used to pay any attention to me...
...was to laugh at me or insult me.
- You know that guy Doug Snell?
- Yeah.
He shook my hand when we walked in here?
He used to call me, "Four-eyed worm."
You showed them all.
You're rich and famous and successful...
...and you have a beautiful wife.
You were always friendly to me.
I appreciated that.
It's Crazy Charlie, the appliance king!
Hey, Charlie!
Look at you! You're putting on a little weight, man!
You look great. Great.
So, this is the reunion? It's wonderful.
Like, wonderful!
Are you and Peggy still talking?
I mean, is it amicable?
She hasn't changed at all, Charlie.
- Your daughter's a real doll.
- "Why, I oughta..."
Hello.
Hello!
Can I have your attention, please?
Listen up! Can I have your attention?
I know everybody's having a great time...
... but now, you have to get ready for that moment you've all been waiting for.
Dad? Hi.
The Reunion Committee has selected a king and a queen.
Let's get back to business.
The Reunion Committee has given this a lot of thought...
... and decided on two people who best represent the spirit...
... of Buchanan High's Class of '60!
What are you doing?
The king is someone who, in more ways than one...
... has come a long way since he left here...
... and we are especially proud to welcome him back.
Richard Norvik!
Come on up here, King Richard!
I demand a recount!
That's gotta be Getz!
First you gotta learn how to count.
Hold me back!
Well, I just want to say thank you.
Sharon and I feel real welcome.
We're having a great time.
Boy, our high school looks really good from up here.
And I just wanna say, it's good to be back.
Thanks a lot.
- Now, every king deserves a queen.
- Over here!
Not you, Getz!
Life of the party!
But when we sent out the invitations...
... we didn't mention anything about this being a costume party...
... and perhaps we should've...
... because just looking at her brings it all back!
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you our queen...
... Peggy Sue Kelcher Bodell!
Come on up here, Peggy Sue!
I can't. I can't do it.
Yes, you can.
Go on, you can do it. Go on.
You can do it.
Congratulations.
Thank you, thank you very much.
Mom!
Now, hold your arm up.
Would you like your Twinkie now?
Charlie?
I want to suck your blood!
I also want to suck your Twinkie!
- Am I dead?
- No. You are the undead.
Let's have it. You hate them, anyway.
Young man! You stop that!
Hey, I just made a deposit in your bank.
Now I want to make a withdrawal.
I think it's time for your next class.
- Go on! All of you!
- I'm a little worried about the side effects.
Now, you lie back down.
What am I doing here?
You passed out for a minute, that's all.
Nothing to worry about.
- But how did I get here?
- Why don't you let your friends help you?
Take her into the washroom and splash some cold water on her face...
...and that should perk her up.
- Yes, ma'am.
How are you doing?
Blood drive? 1960?
Wanna smoke?
No, Carol. That's the worst thing for her.
I gave them up years ago.
- Where is it?
- Where's what?
Maddy, what did you do to your hair?
I'm taking you back to the nurse.
- Delores, why aren't you giving blood?
- I can't. I'm too anaemic.
Maybe you should drink some of that nail polish.
It might give you strength.
Why don't you come back and show me how?
We're going to take you home now.
That's okay.
I'm sure I can remember the way.
Steady now.
People get weak when they give blood.
It's wonderful Spring Radio.
At 1280 on your AM dial, here's more from our golden survey.
And now from The Champs, let's party with a little Tequila.
- I'll call you later.
- Yes! Let's keep in touch.
Who is it?
Peggy. Peggy Sue.
Come on in. I left the door open for you.
The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.
I have a note.
- How do you feel?
- I was excused.
Why don't you go upstairs and lie down for a while?
Oh, Mom!
Chanel No. 5.
It always reminds me of home.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
- You sure you're going to be all right?
- Yeah.
What is going on?
Nancy?
It's Nancy!
My baby sister!
- I'm so happy to see you!
- What are you doing?
Mom said you were sick.
You're never happy to see me.
I'm sorry! I'm sorry about that.
I want us to be closer.
I have too many unresolved relationships in my life.
Teenagers are weird.
And you're the weirdest.
You wanna play a game?
Come here.
How about Monopoly?
Or Parcheesi. Or Chutes and Ladders?
I have a question.
Let me turn the tables on you.
Maybe you, down here, don't know.
Is there anybody in the house knows where Dion and the Belmonts are?
I don't believe it.
Look at that man. He never ages.
Isn't Kenny Rossi dreamy?
I wish he'd break up with Arlene.
She thinks she's so great.
- Don't eat any of the red ones.
- Why not?
They're bad for you.
They give you red lips.
What the hell? I'm probably dead anyway.
Peggy Sue, get in here!
Dion's almost over.
I left your laundry on your beds, girls.
Don't forget to put it away, okay?
What's for dinner?
Creamed chipped beef on toast with rutabagas.
Your father's favourite.
Not again!
Evelyn! Girls?
What is this out on the street?
Come and take a look!
Who left this out here?
- What is it, dear?
- Come on out and see for yourself!
Don't yell. Stop shouting.
It's cool!
- Dad!
- Wait until I tell Diane.
She's always bragging about her dad's Cadillac.
What do you think, Peggy Sue?
Oh, Dad! You were always doing stuff like that! It's funny.
It's really funny. You bought an Edsel.
Young lady, what's the matter with you?
Are you drunk?
Just a little. I had a tough day.
No, don't wear it out, Nancy!
We can't afford a new car.
Do we have to take it back?
I fail to see the humour of this!
Go to your room, you're grounded!
- Grounded?
- Put that down!
That's the story of my life! I'm an adult.
I'm going to go to Liverpool and discover The Beatles.
Jack, take it easy!
She gave blood at school today.
- She's a little lightheaded.
- This is not giving blood! This is drunk!
Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humour.
- Evelyn, put her to bed!
- Come on, Mom!
You're making a mountain out of a molehill.
A tempest in a teapot!
My little baby.
Don't try to grow up so fast.
Mom, I forgot you were ever this young.
Sleep, baby.
Good morning.
What happened to your hair, Peggy?
You have such a pretty face.
- Why are you always trying to cover it up?
- I forgot.
- 'Morning.
- 'Morning.
Excuse me.
Nancy, put your homework down and sit down.
You're looking bright and chipper this morning.
I'm still here.
I thought I might as well enjoy myself.
I think I'll go to school today.
You know, Dad, I'm sorry about yesterday.
The Edsel is a classic.
Use it in the best of health.
Well, thank you.
But don't ever let anything like that happen again.
You're far too young to start acquiring bad habits.
I agree. You know, Mom and Dad...
...you are the best parents a girl could ever have.
I'm really gonna try and behave myself.
Sure you will!
Come on, Momma, sit down.
You want me to sit?
I mean, isn't this great?
Just all of us here together!
Can I tell Charlie
Peggy Sue got drunk last night?
Young lady!
I forgot about him. What am I gonna do?
- Did you two have a fight?
- Sort of.
- About what?
- House payments.
Baby!
How do you feel?
Pretty strange.
Come on. Get in. I can take care of that.
I have a headache.
Headache?
You drive like a maniac!
It's not that I'm glad you were sick...
...but it just gave me a chance to do some thinking last night.
- Yeah?
- Yeah. About what we said on Tuesday.
I think it makes a lot of sense.
- Refresh my memory.
- How could you forget?
We talk about seeing other people and you forget.
I must have blocked it out.
Yeah. I guess I can understand that.
But, please, don't start crying again.
It's not gonna be forever.
I figure three years is long enough for the music to pan out, which it will.
I know it.
So right after graduation we should...
...one: Start to see other people so that we can...
...two: We can comparison-shop.
And then, three:
Settle down and get married.
Why wait? Why not break up now?
Because we got the prom coming up and all these parties.
- We don't want to upset our parents.
- They'll learn to live with it.
Peggy Sue!
Peggy Sue, come here.
Peggy Sue.
Did you study for the test?
- Test? There's a test?
- Yeah.
All right, class. Time's up.
And what's the meaning of this,
Peggy Sue?
Mr. Snelgrove...
...I happen to know that in the future
I will have no use for algebra.
And I speak from experience.
- Who said that?
- I'm sorry.
Sit down!
The result of his struggle is that Santiago comes back with honour.
Santiago comes back with nothing!
There's no meat on the bone.
It's Hemingway's ego trying to defend itself again.
Trying to prove he can still perform.
What Hemingway's saying, Michael, is that we are alone.
That when we go out too far, we're vulnerable.
The irony that Santiago is beaten by the sharks...
...doesn't make him less of a hero.
Who is the victim and who is the predator?
We'll finish this discussion next week.
And don't forget, first four chapters of The Great Gatsby by Monday.
Hope you enjoy it.
Why does your father take inventory on Sunday nights?
Hi, Peggy.
It's poker night.
You always got out of it before.
I just gotta string him along for a while.
It's for his own good.
You're not going into his business.
When are you gonna tell him?
Soon.
Walter!
I can't tell everybody everything all at once.
Strange rumours are sweeping the school about you.
Hi, Peggy.
What do you mean?
- I hear you gave it to old Smellygrove.
- I was there! She told him off to his face!
Attagirl, Peg!
Arthur, please don't call me Peg.
"Why, I oughta..."
I don't get it.
That's 'cause you're not a total moron like they are.
It's a stupid movie thing they started.
That's enough outta you, little lady!
"Why, I oughta..."
I'll be right back.
Hi, Richard.
I wanted to congratulate you on winning the math contest.
It really wasn't that difficult.
What are you doing?
You fishing for four-eyed worms?
Get lost, you macho schmuck!
I wanted to talk to you.
It's really important.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year.
I'm too busy.
No, it's not about that.
Would you meet me after school, please?
All right. I'll be in the physics lab.
Make it 4:30.
I have to go to a Rocket Club meeting.
Sure.
She's not wasting any time.
- Peggy Sue and Mr. Square Root.
- He's a nice guy. He's writing a book.
A book? Excuse me for a second.
Why is she punishing herself?
Come on, Peggy Sue. Try it again.
You haven't been practising.
Sorry.
What a girl, what a twirl.
Peg "Leggy" Sue Kelcher.
A brief but glorious career as a majorette.
Baby!
Looking good out there!
Thanks.
I love it when you twirl your baton.
I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch.
I guess I deserved it.
I've been thinking about my three-year plan.
I think it's totally unworkable.
I must have been delirious.
I don't know.
I thought it made some sense.
Well, in the abstract, maybe.
Get a good grip on yourself.
When I think about you going out with other guys, I feel...
Rejected? Worthless? Miserable?
Yeah.
Good.
Boy, that's some kite!
I'm writing a book on kite construction.
So what do you wanna talk about?
I just wanted to ask you a question.
Do you think time travel is possible?
- Are you doing a science project?
- Sort of.
Well, that's a very interesting question.
Well, now, let's see.
If we look at this in a Newtonian framework...
...the possibilities of time travel were limited.
With the advent of the relativity theory, that's Einstein's relativity theory...
...the idea of absolute time cannot be reasonably affirmed.
Well, then we have Richard's burrito.
What's that?
That's my own theory, based on a Mexican food called the burrito.
- I had one at Disneyland.
- I know what a burrito is!
You see, I think that time is like a burrito...
...in the sense that one part of itself will fold over...
...and it will just touch the other part.
- What's inside?
- You can fill it with whatever you want.
You can fill it with memories, with experiences, trigonometry. Anything.
Then you think that time travel is possible for people?
Yes, it is. It is possible.
It's absolutely possible for people, dogs, elephants, cancan girls.
Then I'm not crazy!
I really don't know if you're crazy.
I know most people think I am.
- Come here, Richard.
- What?
- Come on.
- What are you doing?
Wait a minute, what are you...
Now, I want to tell you something.
You have to promise not to tell anyone!
- Okay. I won't.
- No, I'm serious. No one else can know.
I won't.
I promise, I'm not gonna tell anybody.
I have come here from the future, from 25 years ahead.
I think that you're probably crazy.
I don't have time for this.
I don't have time for jokes.
- I know what you people think about me.
- No!
And I don't appreciate it!
You're just the smartest guy I knew to ask.
I know it sounds unbelievable, but I can prove it.
Well, proof is an excellent concept. How?
You have a blind grandfather.
You're gonna invent this machine that reads books for the blind.
You're gonna invent a lot of things.
You're gonna be really famous.
Wait a minute.
How did you know about my grandfather?
Because I'm telling you the truth.
I read about your invention in a magazine.
I know a lot of things that are gonna happen.
There's gonna be test-tube babies and heart transplants.
An American...
...named Neil Armstrong will be the first man to walk on the moon.
July 20, 1969.
That's six years ahead of schedule.
I would be very careful about this if I were you.
What if you fall into the hands of some madman...
...with plans to manipulate your brain?
- Well, that's why I was getting a divorce.
You know what I really think happened?
I think I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
- You look great for a corpse.
- I'm serious.
- You're giving me the creeps.
- Well, am I dead or not?
There's one way to find out.
- Give me this.
- What are you doing?
Confucians say, "If you want a way out, go through a door."
There's a fire truck.
If you're dead, it'll pass right through you.
Now just stay there. You're dead.
Young lady!
No, I don't wanna die!
It's all right.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
I had it made into a cocktail ring, though.
This is good.
Well, there's not a whole heck of a lot here.
- Very nice pieces.
- So, thank you.
I'll take them to the shop and have the appraisal ready next week.
- Good day, Mrs. Kelcher.
- Good-bye.
- Who was that man?
- That was nobody, Peggy.
I'm voting for the Democrats this year.
You know how your father feels about Democrats.
That was a polltaker.
I wouldn't mention it, if I were you.
How was school today, darling?
It was nice to see everybody again.
I don't know.
Everything they teach is so useless.
And the lunch! God, that was the worst!
Get that, Peggy.
- Hello?
- Peggy Sue? This is Grandma.
- Grandma?
- How's my little girl been?
- Grandpa and I are very concerned.
- What's the matter?
What's up?
- It's Grandma. I can't talk. I'm sorry.
- What's wrong?
Mom, I'll call you back. It's Peggy.
It's okay. I'll call you back.
Peggy Sue, what is it?
What happened to you just now?
What is this all about?
I dreamed that Grandma died.
Oh, baby. No wonder you're so upset.
She's getting on, it's true, but she's fine.
I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday.
She called to find out how you are.
I love her so much and I haven't seen her in so long.
- Grandpa Barney, is he all right?
- He's perfectly fine.
You saw them at Easter.
What's this all about, Peggy?
I don't know. I forgot.
- I'll call her tomorrow. I'll apologise.
- Good girl. I hate to see you so upset.
You're my angel.
Peggy, I don't mean to be intrusive.
But are you having problems with Charlie?
You mentioned something this morning.
A lot of things are confusing right now.
Charlie's just one of them.
Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing?
What do you mean?
Peggy, you know what a penis is.
Stay away from it.
You're the best.
Make her love me, okay?
Feed me. Charge me.
Go get her, tiger.
Get the door, Jack!
Just a moment!
Hello, Charlie.
- Hello, Mr. Kelcher.
- Come on in.
- How are things at the hat store?
- Very good.
Charlie, could I have a word with you?
- Something wrong, sir?
- No, not a thing.
I'd just like to talk to you.
Hi, Mrs. Kelcher!
- How do you do today?
- Good.
- You look wonderful. Snap, crackle, pop.
- They're delicious.
Sit down, Charlie.
Nancy.
That sounded really great, Nancy.
Charlie, you may have noticed that...
...Peggy Sue has been acting a little bit strange lately?
- Indeed.
- She's distorted!
Nancy, please.
She seems to be a little bit nervous and confused.
Over-emotional and even a little bit irresponsible at times.
Of course, her mother says,
"That's the way girls act sometimes."
She's almost a juvenile delinquent.
- No!
- Out!
"Why, I oughta..."
Oh, God!
Yes, sir, but I think that's what I like about Peggy, Mr. Kelcher.
She's not like all the other girls at school.
Charlie, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music...
...we've always regarded you as a very fine young man.
- Thank you, sir.
- And we've trusted you with our daughter.
Well, trust is a two-way street.
In the past two years...
...l've been pleased to note that you and Mrs. Kelcher...
...have provided your sacred trust with upbringing the woman...
...that I plan to take off your hands.
Charlie's downstairs.
Why aren't you ready?
- For what?
- For Maddy's party, that's for what!
Mom, I don't feel like going to a party.
Feel or not feel, you accepted the invite.
Maddy's one of your best friends.
I baked the Rice Krispie squares.
You're supposed to be doing your homework.
I need to talk to your sister.
Baby.
Try and enjoy yourself.
This is the best time of your whole life.
The sooner you learn to handle Charlie, the better.
Stand up to Charlie.
Be a good girl.
Wear something cheerful. Perky.
We think this party might cheer her up.
As long as you understand what's expected of you.
What would that be?
Show her a good time, but for heaven's sake, restrain yourself!
Of course!
- Hi.
- Hi.
Charlie?
Your sweater!
- It's great, isn't it?
- It's really '50s!
It's like you clash with the whole world.
What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird?
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night!
- Good night, Mom.
- Be good, dear.
- Good night, Mr. And Mrs. Kelcher.
- Good-bye.
Have a good time, youngsters!
Nancy.
You look really beautiful.
Thank you.
- I cleaned the car. Do you like it?
- Yeah, looks better at night.
I got tickets for Fabian on your birthday.
You like him, right? Yeah, he's cool.
I was thinking of four ushers and four bridesmaids.
The Yankees have the pitching, but the White Sox have defence.
What will your colours be?
Kubek and Richardson any day over Fox and Aparicio.
Pink and green.
- Look, Carol!
- What?
Look at Delores. What a tramp.
My God!
I think that pitching wins pennants.
The Tigers have got four twenty-game potential winners.
You'd be surprised at how many girls in school aren't virgins.
Like who?
Don Mossi, Frank Lary,
Jim Bunning and Paul Foytack.
- Hello?
- Hello!
And now, direct from four weeks of rehearsal in Walter's garage...
... four guys who have prided themselves on becoming the best group in the world.
Walter, Leon, Terry and Charlie,
The Definitions!
Charlie can really sing!
Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts!
I wouldn't count on it.
Come on! Where's your enthusiasm?
He really is kind of cute, isn't he?
Yeah!
He really loves you, too. You're so lucky!
He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
- He is?
- Yeah!
Carol and I saw you with that creep Richard Norvik today.
First of all, he's not a creep.
He's exceptional.
You'd know that if you took any time.
You just pity him since he has no friends.
If you weren't so neurotic and insecure...
...maybe you could shut up and show some compassion.
Are you for real?
I don't know what you said to her, but I wish I'd said it.
Hi, fellas.
Walter!
- What do you think about Richard Norvik?
- He's a nice guy.
Is he going to help you with all that physics stuff?
He's trying.
Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
Put on some make-out music and turn out the lights!
There's not a girl in school that can hold a candle to you.
You're pretty charming when you want to be.
I know. But I don't have to flatter you.
It just feels right.
You're the perfect girl for me...
...as in: Is, was...
...and always will be.
I'm glad dancing was invented.
You know, the first dances were rituals.
Like fertility rites.
I always loved the way you kissed.
I missed you.
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.
And the tide rushes in.
You really love me, don't you?
You know I do.
I even wrote you into my will.
Charlie, let's make love.
What? You mean sex?
Intercourse.
You want to have intercourse?
Last weekend you said... What time is it?
Holy cow, it's late!
A lot of things have happened since last weekend.
You were the one who said we should wait and you were right.
We should wait till we get married.
I know I must have believed that...
...when I said it, but...
...doesn't Lucky Chucky want to come out?
- Who?
You know, your love machine.
Your throbbing thrill hammer. Your thing.
You mean my wang?
Listen, it's running real late!
Come on! What is this?
What the hell is going on, Peggy Sue?
One week you say,
"If you love me, you won't."
The next week you say,
"If you love me, you will."
That's a guy's line!
Forget about it. I made a mistake.
You're damn right!
Jesus, Peggy, you sure know how to spoil a mood.
I'm sorry.
Save it, woman! Humiliator!
I was very impressed with what you said in English class today.
Gilford's okay, except that he thinks that Hemingway's great literature.
And you don't?
He's a fisherman.
The most overrated writer of the century.
I mean, man, he is the perfect American author:
Fat, violent, drunk.
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
A writer's life is his work.
Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about!
I mean, man, he's out there burning, feeling, grooving on life!
"The young man leaned back in his chair.
"No bulls would die today."
What are you doing here, anyway?
Coffee, donuts.
I thought chicks like you travelled in packs.
Man, I'm a hip chick.
- Come on, Delores.
- Terry, slow down!
What?
Look, there's Peggy Sue with Michael Fitzsimmons!
- That Commie beatnik?
- First a geek and now a weirdo!
This is great.
This is great reefer.
It must belong to Beth.
I found it in my dress. It's really old.
It travels well.
Well, the world sure looks better up here.
The world is fantastic.
It's the ultimate absurd circus.
And I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
What are you shooting for?
Maximum intensity.
I'm going to get out of here.
I'm going to write.
I'm checking out of this bourgeois motel.
Push myself away from the dinner table and say:
"No more Jell-O for me, Mom!"
Don't you get along with your parents?
All my father digs is money.
All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
Come on! They care about you.
- They're just a different generation.
- What's with you?
I thought you were cool.
You rode my bike. You blew some pot.
What's your scene, Miss Majorette?
You going to marry Mr. Blue lmpala...
...and graze around with the other sheep for the rest of your life?
No. I already did that.
I want to be a dancer.
That's what I want to do.
I'm going to dance and dance.
Come here.
You know, I had you pegged all wrong.
"Ray of oneness piercing the solitude
"Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh"
Is that one of your poems?
No, I just made that up.
- Do you want to hear one?
- Yeah.
It's called Tenderness.
"I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream
"Betrayed by a kiss
Sucking pods of bitterness
"In the madhouse of Doctor Dread
Razor shreds of rat puke
"Fall on my bare arms"
I'm sorry. I was trying to impress you.
Michael. You're as good as you looked.
"How many loved your moments of glad grace
"And loved your beauty with love false or true
"But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you
"And loved the sorrows of your changing face"
I didn't write that. That's Yeats.
I envy you.
You have your whole life ahead of you and you know exactly what you want.
But no more rat puke, okay?
Try and write something beautiful.
I'll respect you for eternity.
You know, this really isn't happening.
- And one Shostakovich.
- Shostakovich?
Charlie, I'm just taking Ravel!
Listen. Take the Shostakovich home.
Listen to it. Let it grow on you.
If you don't like it
I will give you your money back.
I did like the Dvorák one you suggested.
I liked that a lot.
And, young man, you talked me into it.
It's the most definitive Dvorák!
You'll like it. I kid you not.
- What do you know about classical music?
- Nothing. But selling is selling.
Charlie, about last night...
Hush, baby, hush. I've been thinking.
Girls must go through that stuff, too.
Sometimes when I look at you
I feel like an animal.
I don't know. Maybe my dad's right.
Teenagers are nuts.
But I'm not.
I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of experiences you can't understand.
Girls mature faster than guys.
But last night,
I was the one who put on the brakes.
- And do you know why?
- Why?
Because nothing else matters.
That's the great thing about love.
Every time we argue...
...every time something goes wrong, and I know I'm not perfect either...
...things just work out better in the end.
Because you're my baby. And I love you.
Charlie, what am I going to do with you?
Boy! Just cherish me.
You have an opportunity to be the richest woman in the world...
...and I'm going to be your partner.
I'll tell you where the fortune is:
Running shoes...
...tennis and jogging shoes, all that kind of stuff.
I mean, I'm talking $50, $100, $200 a pair.
- Wait, you got to be kidding.
- No!
You're talking about exercise stuff?
Like gym stuff?
Not your style.
These are the choices, okay?
Microwave ovens, pocket calculators...
...Walkmans, digital watches...
...and miniature television sets.
And huge radios.
For some reason everything else gets tiny, but portable radios get enormous.
Huge, enormous radios?
- Portable enormous radios.
- Wait a minute, I got an idea. Come on!
- What?
- Come on!
Come here!
Here.
- Excuse me, miss.
- Yes.
- Do you have pantyhose?
- I'm sorry, what?
Pantyhose. You know...
"Pantyhose"?
Why, Richard!
This is lingerie.
Mrs. Woodhouse, I am studying the fabric for the aerodynamic principles for kites.
They don't have it!
They've never heard of it.
Isn't it wonderful?
- What?
- I'm talking about the wave of the future.
I've decided on our first fortune.
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.
You just keep thinking high tech.
"High tech"? That's nice.
I like the sound of that. High tech.
- All right, what is the scoop?
- What?
How come we're your friends and we find out about...
...you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Delores?
Who needs satellites when I've got Delores' mouth?
I hear she does more than talk with her mouth.
That's disgusting!
Maddy, would you grow up?
It says in Love Without Fear the tongue kiss is a means...
...of genital stimulation, is widely practised and has much to commend it!
Did you memorise the book or just the good parts?
No. Just what you underlined.
You did!
You know, Carol, you have great hair.
Peggy Sue, come on!
What's with you and Michael?
Yeah, come on!
He's so cool and mysterious.
Well, he's interesting.
Underneath that rough exterior lurks the heart of a true poet.
A poet?
I bet Delores told Charlie!
- That loudmouthed little bitch!
- Peggy Sue!
Watch out for her, Peggy Sue.
She's after Charlie.
Just cool it, girls.
Charlie's free to go out with whoever he wants to.
What?
But I always thought you were going to marry Charlie.
Carol would marry Walter and I'd marry Arthur.
We'd all live on the same street and...
...take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday.
It's going to spoil everything if you and Charlie break up.
That Michael Fitzsimmons doesn't look like the barbecue type.
Come on! I just had one date with him.
I'm not going to marry him!
You promise?
Come on, let's go to the movies.
Peggy Sue, I mean, don't be silly.
It's Saturday night. It's date night.
I got to go. Arthur's picking me up soon.
Wait a minute. No, I mean just the girls.
Like a slumber party.
- Aren't we too old for that?
- Sometimes you're so immature.
Well, we...
'Bye!
I'm immature?
Charlie? Charlie, I had such a dream.
Peggy Sue, I have to talk to you.
Charlie, what are you doing here?
Let's go down to the basement.
Okay.
I want to know what's going on.
Delores told me about you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons.
When you dropped me off last night
I didn't feel like going to bed.
- And I ran into Michael and went for a ride.
- Then it's true, damn it!
I had a miserable time tonight because of you.
When the Monotones did Book of Love:
"Chapter four, you break up
Won't you give it one more chance?"
I'm thinking, "Did we break up?"
Did we break up?
Because if we did
I don't even know about it.
Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
You know, I hate your sarcasm.
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue.
No one treats Charlie Bodell like this.
Why do you talk about yourself in the third person like you were Napoleon?
- Why is everything an argument with you?
- Look! I've got the hair.
I've got the teeth. I've got the eyes.
Peggy, look outside that window.
I've got the car. I'm the lead singer.
I'm the man.
Why are you arguing with me?
It's over, Charlie. I don't want to hurt you.
I want you to be happy.
But, no. I will be happy if I have you.
I love you.
No! That doesn't make any difference.
We just can't live together.
And you went off with that bimbo Janet.
What are you talking about?
Who is Janet?
- I don't know any Janet.
- I just can't trust you!
But what about everything
I said to you this afternoon?
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
I have this window in my heart and anytime you want, you can crawl in.
I got to close it or nothing's going to be different.
- What has to be different?
- Everything!
You know it's not going to work like this.
You have to go to college and finish.
What about the group and my singing career?
What about me?
I am trying to save you years of frustration of waiting for...
...that big break. No.
That big disappointment so you can blame me for the rest of your life.
You don't know zip.
You think I'm going to spend the rest of my life selling appliances?
Chasing women around the store like my father?
I've got to give it a shot.
What the hell has changed, Peggy Sue?
Until yesterday you loved me and you loved us.
For two years,
I've done nothing but love you.
All right, I'll prove it to you. I'll show you.
I'm going to be just like Fabian.
Let's sit there.
Sure.
This is great.
Okay, here we go.
- Suds for you.
- Thank you.
And a whiskey for you.
Five more weeks of school.
Ten minutes past graduation, I'm gone!
To freedom!
For everyone.
Now, this is the plan.
As soon as school is finished, we move to Utah.
Utah?
I thought you'd be going to Paris or New York.
What's in Utah?
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool.
You'll really dig her.
She's got this little cabin outside the hills of Provo where she raises chickens.
I'll write, and you two can take care of the chickens to support us.
- I can't do that.
- Why not?
Polygamy's legal in Utah.
I'm allergic to chickens.
Wait. What about the other night?
We were like two stars in the same constellation.
Michael, you and I are light-years apart.
You should go, but not with me.
But we had heat, baby. Passion! Fire!
We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.
At least one more time.
That's a great line.
You are going to be a terrific writer.
- You think so?
- Yeah.
Michael, we had one glorious night together.
Someday you'll remember and write about it.
Yeah.
I can dig that.
Bittersweet perfection.
Dogs of lust on leashes of memory. Yes!
It's Charlie.
What a treat.
Now I get it.
It's great.
Peggy Sue's still stuck on
"Treble Without a Cause."
Come on, I want to dance.
I thought I knew everything about him.
Can we split now?
Thank you.
So, Mr. Wilkins, new client?
I'm sorry, Charlie.
I don't think so, you know.
It happens, but not with you.
Believe me when I tell you.
Maybe it's the material.
But it can't happen.
Good morning.
Charlie?
What are you doing here?
I wanted to talk to you.
I've got one last thing
I have to do at school and then...
Elvis. Hi. How are you? Hi, guy.
Elvis is dead. That's Ajax.
I guess I always liked Elvis.
- Can I have a ride to school?
- No.
- Why?
- The tiger's out of commission for a while.
Come on.
- How about a walk, Charlie Bell?
- How did you know about that?
I was at Lena's last night.
I heard you sing.
I thought you were terrific.
Not terrific enough.
What were you doing there?
- Who were you with?
- Well, what were you doing there?
You never told me you sang with an R & B group.
There's not a whole heck of a lot we know about each other, Peggy.
- I forgot how much music meant to you.
- That's real big of you.
Stop being so defensive. Here.
I wrote a song for you.
- Why did you write me a song?
- Because I want to help you.
- It'll be a hit. I promise.
- Come on! Stop being sarcastic.
Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night.
He told me to forget it.
Would you just take a look at it?
Come on. I wrote it for you.
Well, if you wrote it I guess I'll look at it.
Listen, about the other night,
I feel so stupid.
I'm beginning to think that maybe there is more to life than just music.
Do you think the world would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
Yeah.
Do you want to walk to school?
Okay, I'll just put the dog inside.
Come on, Ajax.
What's the matter, princess?
Lost your prince?
Delores, there are a lot of things
I could say to you...
...but you're just not worth the effort.
- I'm so sorry. These pens are so tricky, I...
- You did that on purpose!
I hate you! Go stuff your bra!
- I beg your pardon?
- Take a long walk on a short pier.
Have a nice day.
You know, Peggy, there are so many things to look forward to in the future.
I came to say good-bye, Richard.
Good-bye? Wait a minute. Sit down.
Good-bye? Where are you going?
Peggy, we have a partnership here.
- I'm making progress on that microchip.
- Well, you were meant to.
You're one of the people good things happen to.
So are you.
- You have a vision, Peggy.
- A vision?
I am a walking anachronism!
I've upset my parents. I miss my kids.
I could be trapped here forever.
And poor Charlie.
I got pregnant when I was 18.
That was why we had to get married.
Tomorrow's my birthday.
- I have to get out of here.
- You broke up with Charlie?
Yeah. I know it's a gamble.
I've loved him for a long, long time.
Okay. Then let's do something really visionary.
Change your destiny, Peggy Sue.
Change your destiny and marry me.
No! Peggy Sue got married.
Case closed.
I don't want to marry anyone, Richard.
Good-bye.
Wait! Peggy, please. Can I go with you?
No! You have to be valedictorian.
Peggy Sue, wait a minute!
Listen, I cut shop and I did some work on your song.
You know, it's not half bad for your first try.
I changed all the "yeahs" to "oohs," but listen to this:
"She loves you, ooh, ooh, ooh
You love me, ooh, ooh, ooh"
I got to go.
About your birthday.
I made reservations at Chez Trev.
I thought it would be great to eat at a nice restaurant.
I won't be here.
- Why?
- I want to go see my grandparents.
Good-bye, Charlie.
I cancelled the tickets for Fabian.
Close that.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
Look! Oh, it's so beautiful.
What's the matter, Peggy?
Someone jump on your grave?
You know, Peggy, your mother said you had a dream that I died.
I wish she hadn't have told you that.
I'm not afraid.
I know exactly when I'm going to die.
What's it going to be, Lizzy?
Seventy-five or eighty?
I'm not telling!
I've been trying to drag that out of her for years.
You know, dreams are a fascinating business.
- Especially when you see the future.
- Do you believe all this?
Well, I like to speculate.
Like this book I'm reading right now.
It's about a woman in Colorado who says she lived in Ireland 150 years ago.
She gives names, dates and where she lived.
Grandma. Grandpa.
I want to tell you something.
If you believe it, darling, then I believe.
Being young is just as confusing as being old.
The things that happened to me
50 years ago...
...are more on my mind than the things that happen today.
But I'm remembering the future.
A chilling wind tonight.
It's really picking up.
Right now, you're just browsing through time.
Choose the things you'll be proud of.
Things that last.
I'm proud of my children.
I miss them so much.
Scott and Beth.
I named my daughter after you.
Sweetheart, thank you.
Grandpa.
When you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone.
And I'll never see the cousins anymore.
It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together.
If you could do it all again, Grandpa, what would you do different?
I'd have taken better care of my teeth.
Now what's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
It's her 18th birthday and I want to show her off.
It was my idea, Grandma.
I wondered about those lodge meetings.
He won't tell me.
But I have my suspicions.
I don't want to know.
Have a good time, darling.
All right.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye, darling.
Grandpa?
What does Grandma think you do at these meetings?
Stag movies and poker.
I may be an old fool, but I think I can help you.
At least I got to see you and Grandma again.
Has this ever worked before?
The last time was 600 years ago.
And it's about time for another one.
Welcome, Peggy Sue!
Peggy Sue! Welcome, Peggy Sue!
- It's so wonderful to have you here with us.
- Thank you.
You've come to the right place.
Our lodge was founded by a time traveller.
- We're going to send you back home.
- That's right!
You know, this is very exciting for all of us.
You know, we've waited a long time to find a girl like you.
Yes!
Grandpa! Do you have to wear that hat?
Wouldn't be a lodge without hats.
"Lord of the universe.
"Vast and mighty one.
"Ruler of light.
"King of the sun.
"This girl is lost amid your mysteries...
"...and wishes to return to her own time.
"We adore thee and invoke thee!
"Grant thine aid.
"Look with favour upon us as we witness the regeneration of spirit.
"We ask thy intervention...
"...that this girl may return to thee on the wings of thy love."
"Womb of the mother, reclaim thy child of light."
"The name of your love is rebirth."
- This is never going to work.
- It's going to work!
"Reclaim thy child of light."
"We offer up this girl that her soul may find its home."
It's nothing to worry about.
Somebody get the lights.
Somebody get the lights!
She's gone!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
I'm saving you!
They were going to vaporise you!
Don't be ridiculous! They're harmless old men! My grandfather was in there!
- Get in the car!
- I'm not getting in this monstrosity!
Well, the girl's gone.
Let's play cards.
I've got good news.
Now sit down right here.
You've got two minutes!
I told my father that I'm going to quit singing.
And he gave me 10 percent of the business right now!
- What are you talking about?
- I know what you've been going through.
You were just scared.
But you don't have to be scared anymore.
I can support you now.
- Shit!
- Peggy Sue?
Will you marry me?
How can you know what I've been going through?
Of course I'm scared!
I can't change anything.
- I can't help anybody.
- You're not listening to me.
- I'm proposing to you now.
- You betrayed me.
You were never there for me and the children.
I'll be there for the children.
I'll forget Walter.
Forget the group. I want to marry you!
Don't be crazy.
I may be crazy, but I'm not crazy enough to marry you twice.
Christ.
Peggy.
I'm sorry.
I thought I was what you wanted me to be.
It's all my fault.
Here.
It's a birthday present.
I'm tired of being the romantic fool.
I'm going to go save my car.
Charlie?
It opens, too.
Look inside.
Scott and Beth. Where did you get this?
Who are Scott and Beth?
Your mother gave me those.
It's you and me.
You know that.
So are they.
I do love you.
I love you.
This is right, Peggy Sue.
I want this to be forever.
Mom, can you hear me?
Please, Mom, can you hear me?
They call what happened a near-death...
... but we figured out exactly what the problem is...
You are a very lucky young lady!
What happened to you, Peggy Sue, was a very rare problem...
... with the rhythm of your heart.
Mom, do you remember anything?
In fact, at the party, they had to do CPR on you...
... before the paramedics arrived to give your heart a shock and restart it.
Dad's been here every day.
"'Cause I love you, Peggy Sue
"I love you, girl, and I need you, Peggy"
Charlie?
- Was I dead?
- I thought you were for a while.
You look awful.
You look like you haven't slept in days.
- You look so old.
- But happy.
Very happy, Peggy.
I thought I knew everything about you.
I'm sorry.
I wanted to tell you that I...
- I wanted to...
- I'm sorry.
I can't live without you.
What about Janet?
That's over.
I got tired of translating everything to her.
She thought the Big Bopper was a hamburger.
- Who are all the flowers from?
- Everyone.
Maddy and Arthur, Carol and Walter...
...Richard Norvik.
And here's a book by that guy in high school, Michael Fitzsimmons.
He dedicated it to you.
It couldn't be me. I hardly knew him.
I'll just set this right here.
I had a strange experience.
I went back to high school and I spent a lot of time with you.
You and Walter and Leon were singing
I Wonder Why.
God! Dion!
You were terrific.
And I kept trying to push you away.
- But you wouldn't give up.
- I'll never give up.
Would you hold me?
I don't expect that all our problems can just vanish.
Christ, I would cut my right arm off for another chance.
No, please, I need some time.
Well, I'll let you get some rest.
I'd like to invite you over to our house for dinner on Sunday.
With your kids.
I'll make a strudel.
CHILDREN: Bless all the people, young and old.
For they are yours to love and hold.
And bless
Mr. and Mrs. Cherrywood.
Amen.
Good night, children.
Sweet dreams.
Mrs. Cherrywood, isn't Mr. Cherrywood going to tuck us in?
Oh, he'll be along.
Don't you worry.
I hope I'm not too late.
They've been asking for you.
Mr. Cherrywood!
MR. CHERRYWOOD:
Look sharp, everyone.
Watch the bouncing balls.
All righty, here we go.
A one, a two, a three and there!
Thank you, and thank you.
Now off to sleep to dream of clowns and circuses, acrobats and jugglers.
And remember,
I want a full report in the morning.
Story, Mr. Cherrywood, story?
GIRL: Please, the one about the circus.
Please?
Yeah.
All right, just one story.
Story hat.
Yeah.
This is the story of two young children named Kim and Jason, and how they were helped by a group of very special friends, the Care Bears.
You see, the Care Bears have a very special mission.
And that mission is to help everyone share their feelings with others.
The Care Bears live in a magic place called Care-a-lot.
* Care-a-lot is a place
 we all can go
* Whenever we choose it
* Care-a-lot is a feeling
 we all know
* We never do lose it
* We can find a secret place
* To rest and make a new start
* If you don't know
 where it is
* Look inside your heart
* Care-a-lot is a playground
 you can find
* For sliding and swinging
* Carousels playing music
 in your mind
* For dancing and singing
* Sometimes you feel so glad
* Sometimes you feel blue
* Share your feelings,
 it's not bad
* Feelings are just you
* When you're lonely
* Don't you fret
* You're not alone
 you just tend to forget
* Care-a-lot is easily found
* You've been there
* And you have friends
 who care
* Don't you let your sadness
 get you down
* It always helps
 when you sing a song
* Good cheer carries you along
* Through darkness leads
 to sunlight
* A new day comes,
 it's all right
* Care-a-lot is a place
 you'd like to be
* Riding on a cloud,
 you'll care a lot
* It's a rainbow fantasy
* For laughing out loud
* Care-a-lot is a place
 we all can go
* Is a place we all can go
* Care-a-lot is a place
 we all can go
* Is a place we all can go
* Care-a-lot,
 it's a place we all can go
* Is a place we all can go
* Learn to care a lot
* Share a lot
* Care-a-lot
No, Secret Bear,
I don't think it was the Cloud-mobile's fault.
Hi. I'm Friend Bear and this is Secret Bear.
We're Care Bears.
What do you want?
Only to be your friends.
MR. CHERRYWOOD: You see,
 although Kim and Jason were
warm and loving children, they had been so hurt
 when their parents
went away that they had decided
 never to love anyone
ever again, just in case
 they, too, went away.
Kim and Jason felt
they didn't need anyone, but the Care Bears
 knew better.
Everyone needs friends, Jason, even you and Kim.
We're not your friends.
How do you know our names?
We know a lot of things about you.
Kim reads a lot of books and wants to be a nurse when she grows up.
And, Jason, you wanna be a jet pilot.
Yeah. How did you know that?
Friends are supposed to know about each other's hopes and dreams.
Secret Bear says not to worry.
No one can keep a secret like Secret Bear.
Well, I'll tell you what we know about people you care for.
They always let you down.
KIM: So we'd rather not have any friends.
Don't trouble yourselves.
MR. CHERRYWOOD:
 While the Care Bears tried
even harder to make friends
 with Kim and Jason,
Tenderheart was on his way
 to help a boy
who wanted friends more than anything else
 in the whole world.
Nicholas was
 a magician's helper.
He had never had
 a friend in his life.
Thanks.
Hey!
Close the door!
Whoa!
I--I didn't mean it.
You never mean it, Nicholas.
I bought that trunk thinking maybe there's some junk in it
I can use in my magic act.
Now half of it's broken!
What am I going to do with you?
Every time I give you a simple thing to do, it's boom this and crash that!
I'm sorry, Mr. Fetuccini.
Enough of your sorrys.
Check that new trunk and see if there's anything left
I can use in my magic act.
I have a show to put on.
Perhaps one day
I will teach you how to make an audience love you.
But right now you're next to hopeless.
I wish...
I'd give anything to find a way to get people to like me.
FEMALE VOICE: Anything?
Nicholas?
Who's there?
Who said that?
You did say
"anything"?
Whoa!
Gosh.
MR. CHERRYWOOD:
 Tenderheart was trapped.
He needed some
 Care Bear reinforcements.
But unfortunately they were
 busy with their new invention.
SHARE BEAR:
With this Rainbow Rescue Beam, we can send a Care Bear anywhere in the whole world in a matter of seconds.
Or bring them back again in case of an emergency.
We'll be able to help people share their feelings a lot quicker.
We've gotta get it working first, Share Bear.
And then we still won't know what'll happen until we give it another test.
How come I'm always the one fixing things around here?
Because you never complain,
Grumpy Bear.
I think I know why the first test didn't work.
There. This little star got itself stuck in the gears.
Now that's what I call
"star stuck," Grumpy Bear.
Has anyone seen Baby Hugs and Baby Tugs?
I can't find them anywhere.
We'll help you look,
Grams Bear.
We can test the Rainbow Rescue Beam later.
That Baby Tugs is probably just getting into mischief somewhere.
What's this thing, Tugs?
It's not a thing, Hugs.
It's, uh, a thing-a-ma-dooey.
You know everything, Tugs.
What's it do?
It makes bubbles.
Square bubbles!
Square bubbles?
Golly, make square bubbles,
Tugs.
Any special color?
No square bubbles, Tugs.
Not even round ones.
HUGS: You broke the thing.
GRUMPY BEAR:
Baby Hugs, Baby Tugs, what have you done?
BIRTHDAY BEAR: It's obvious,
Grumpy Bear, they got the Rainbow Rescue
Beam working.
But we still don't know if it'll transport anyone.
Look!
Oh, my stars, it brought visitors.
What are they doing here?
We didn't bring them.
They just came along.
Someone brought us here.
I knew it!
Baby Bear mischief.
What are we gonna do with those children?
SHARE BEAR: I don't know.
This has never happened before.
Perhaps we can let them stay.
Hey, could we say something?
Where are we?
We're terribly sorry.
Bears?
We're the Care Bears.
BOTH: More friends?
Welcome to Care-a-lot!
Come on.
We'll give you a tour.
Okay, but we're not gonna like it.
(NOBODY CARES LIKE A BEAR
 PLAYING)
* I know you're thinking
 that nobody cares
* You've got some feelings
 you don't wanna share
* But if your troubles stay
 all stuck inside
* They're gonna grow
 till they're too big to hide
* I know you're trying
 to steer so clear of friends
* You've had a few
 that left you in the end
* I gotta tell you
 it ain't always so
* Somebody loves you
 who ain't gonna go
* So follow me
 and let me take you where
* If you think nobody cares
* Nobody cares
* Nobody cares like a bear
* You'll need a friend to get a big job done
* I guess sometimes two heads are better than one
* You'll need a friend to let your feelings free
* Sure could use someone to talk to me
* So make a friend
 and let me take you where
* When you think nobody cares
* Nobody cares
* Nobody cares like a bear
* So don't go sticking
 by your own sweet self
* You gotta take a chance
 on someone else
* That's what it's all about,
 just being friends
* And take a chance
 on loving again
* And follow me
 and let me take you where
* When you think nobody cares
* Nobody cares
* Nobody cares like a bear
* When you think nobody cares
* Nobody cares
* Nobody cares like a bear
MR. CHERRYWOOD: (CHUCKLING)
 Well, thanks to
 the Care Bears,
Kim and Jason remembered
 how good it was
 to have friends who cared.
Their troubles were over.
But for Nicholas,
 his real troubles were
 just beginning.
FEMALE VOICE: Nicholas?
Who are you?
How do you know my name?
I am a spirit, Nicholas.
Your friend.
I know many things.
Almost everything.
Everything?
I know how you can earn
 more friends.
Really? How?
With magic.
Magic?
Oh, not his magic tricks.
I mean real magic.
Magic that can make
 your fondest wish come true.
Y-You mean, you could use magic to get people to like me?
No.
But you could.
All you have to do is undo the lock.
No, don't!
Hey, what are you doing in there?
I've gotta stop this!
Nicholas! Nicky?
Hey, are you okay in there?
Read this.
Did I do that?
You can do a lot more.
Hey, Nicky, open up!
The door's stuck!
Read!
FETUCCINI:
Hey, Nicholas!
SPIRIT: Go ahead.
Open it.
Hey, it worked.
Your spell worked.
Well done, Nicholas.
He'll be in a deep sleep only long enough for you to take over his magic show.
But I couldn't.
Yes, you can. You must.
This is your chance to show that you are a greater magician than he.
They love him for his magic.
They'll love you for yours.
I'll help you.
TENDERHEART:
Nicholas, stop!
This isn't the way to make friends.
Who are you?
I'm Tenderheart, a Care Bear.
Your friend.
Friend?
Where was he when you needed him?
What matters is,
I'm here now, when Nicholas needs me the most.
SPIRIT: See, Nicholas?
Magic can do anything you want it to.
Hey, neat!
TENDERHEART: Magic isn't the answer, Nicholas.
Your feelings can help you find the true answer.
Don't listen to him!
There are dozens of children out there waiting to see your magic.
They'll love me just like they love
The Great Fetuccini.
I know all his tricks.
I'm not doing anything wrong.
He won't succeed.
The spirit doesn't care about him.
But I do!
NICHOLAS:
And now The Amazing Nicholas will pull a dove out of his hat.
Stop it!
I knew this was going to happen.
Make them stop laughing.
Make them stop!
Only you can do that. Here!
Teach them a lesson.
A--A lesson?
BOY: Come on!
Make us laugh.
SPIRIT: One they'll never forget.
Nicholas! No!
Now they know how you felt all your life without a friend in the world.
Now they feel nothing!
Nicholas, what have you done?
Only what they did to me.
They deserved it.
No, Nicholas, please listen!
Quick, Nicholas!
SPIRIT: This is only
 the beginning!
This is a job for all the Care Bears.
WISH BEAR: Jason! Kim!
Wait'll you hear this.
Look, Secret Bear,
Wish Bear's got her head stuck in the clouds again.
Now where's my Star-oscope?
Looking for this?
Oh, sorry, Grumpy Bear, but I'm in a hurry.
I've got great news for Kim and Jason.
I spotted...
Look!
FRIEND BEAR:
Tenderheart's Rainbow Roller is out of control!
Oh, no!
Quick, run for cover!
It's coming!
Brace yourselves!
What's coming?
Everyone okay?
Share Bear?
I think so.
Too bad we can't say the same for Care-a-lot.
Look!
FRIEND BEAR: Oh, no!
Everything's broken!
Faded!
Ruined!
FUNSHINE BEAR: Tenderheart!
The Caring Meter dropped two whole points!
A lot of people must have suddenly just stopped caring.
What could have caused that?
The same thing that caused the cloud quake!
A boy named Nicholas is being taken over by an evil spirit.
An evil spirit?
What happens when the
Caring Meter drops to zero?
No one in the world will care anymore.
And the end of Care-a-lot?
I think that's exactly what the spirit has in mind!
Oh, my gosh, I forgot.
I sighted parents for you at the orphanage.
They want to adopt you both.
Congratulations,
Kim and Jason.
Come on, Grumpy, let's warm up the
Rainbow Rescue Beam.
Kim and Jason have to get back in a hurry.
Hear that, Jason? Parents!
Yeah.
I thought we'd never have parents.
Yeah.
But, Kim...
I know, Jason.
Our friends, they're in trouble.
Kim, Jason, we're ready.
All set?
No!
We're not going back to the orphanage.
We're going to help you.
Yeah.
But you have parents waiting.
We made up our minds.
You showed us how to share our feelings, and that's just what we're going to do.
Yeah? Really?
BOTH: Yeah.
All right, our first job is to go to Earth and find Nicholas.
Friend Bear, Secret Bear, you head down with Kim and Jason.
We'll follow.
Hold on to this for me, Jason.
Don't lose it.
It's very important.
Don't worry, Tenderheart,
I wouldn't lose it for nothing.
All right, Champ Bear and Funshine, you're next!
GRUMPY BEAR: Oh, no!
The Rainbow Rescue Beam's jammed!
They never made it to Earth.
What do you mean?
Where are they?
They're lost somewhere between here and Earth.
What do we do now?
We can't follow them.
And the evil spirit said this was just the beginning.
MR. CHERRYWOOD:
 As Nicholas continued to cast
the spirit's evil spells, more and more people
 stopped caring.
Everyone in this town has friends.
But soon they'll all be just like me.
Friendless!
MR. CHERRYWOOD:
As this wave of uncaring grew, so did the storms
 around Care-a-lot.
The Care Bears were trapped,
cut off from the Earth, and any chance of rescuing
 Kim, Jason, Secret Bear,
 and Friend Bear.
The cloud quakes had broken
 the Rainbow Rescue Beam.
But the Care Bears would
 never give up.
That's what made them think
 of the river.
Good luck, Care Bears.
We're counting on you!
MR. CHERRYWOOD: No one
 in Care-a-lot had ever
 followed the river.
They had no idea whether
 it would lead them to Kim,
Jason, and the missing Care Bears,
 or to nowhere at all.
But the Rainbow Rescue Beam
had dropped Kim, Jason, and the two Care Bears right smack in the middle
 of a strange new land.
Wow.
This doesn't look like the Earth I remember.
Maybe we're still in Care-a-lot.
FRIEND BEAR:
If this is Care-a-lot, then someone's been doing a little gardening since we left.
Whoa!
I can't hold on much longer.
Secret Bear says not to worry about falling.
Worry about the lion instead.
ALL: Lion?
What are we going to do?
FRIEND BEAR: Close your eyes.
Maybe he won't see us.
See? He's gone.
JASON: Kim!
Give me your hand, slowly.
JASON: Oh, no!
Hey, they don't have any tails.
Wow.
The monkey can talk.
What happened to all your fur?
We--We never had any fur.
That's impossible!
Every monkey has fur.
And who said they were monkeys? Hmm?
Well, they were up in the tree.
I know.
They're lions with haircuts.
We're not lions or monkeys.
Yeah. We're people.
And we're Care Bears.
Where did you come from?
BRAVE HEART LION:
Why, we live here.
Everyone in the Forest of Feelings knows of Playful Heart Monkey and Brave Heart Lion.
Forest of Feelings?
Well, we're from Earth.
And Care-a-lot.
Earth? Care-a-lot?
There's no such place.
There is, too!
Don't mind Playful Heart.
He loves to laugh at anything.
I've heard tales long ago about other places.
What are these other places like?
(HOME IS IN YOUR HEART
 PLAYING)
* Do you have a place where rainbows grow
* To carry a bear who's sliding?
* Well, I have a rock in a cave below
* Just perfect for hiding
* Do you have a house made all out of wood
* For keeping you dry when it's raining?
FRIEND BEAR: * I stay on top when the rain goes drop
* Look, I'm hydroplaning
Wee!
* Forest of Feelings,
Care-a-lot
* And earth aren't far apart
* They differ in some ways, some ways not
* 'Cause home is in your heart
* Do you have a star that can travel far
* And tell you what my star told me?
* No, but I have a tree that plays with me
* With branches that swing and enfold me
* Do you have a flower?
We call it a rose
* Its petals are softer than pillows
Look, I see a bee on Friend Bear's nose!
KIM: Stop!
Stay perfectly still.
Oh!
* Forest of Feelings,
Care-a-lot
* And earth are the homes we claim
* Loving each other
* What we've got are places with a different name
* But they're all the same
* Forest of Feelings,
Care-a-lot
* And earth are the homes we claim
* Right here with you, my friend
* Forest of Feelings,
Care-a-lot
* And earth are all the same
* We are all the same
* Do you have a bed where you sleep at night
* With billowy blankets all over?
PLAYFUL HEART MONKEY:
 I sleep in a thicket,
on soft green grass, covered with cushiony clover.
My bed is cozy and light as a cloud.
Your bed is a cloud!
Oh, yeah.
* Colors and flowers and hearts in a crown
* Are just about everywhere
* Forest of Feelings,
Care-a-lot
* And earth aren't far apart
* They differ in some ways, some ways not
* 'Cause home is in your heart
* Home is in your heart
* Forest of Feelings,
Care-a-lot
* And earth are the homes we claim
* We love each other, loving each other
* What we've got are places with a different name
* Home is all the same
* Forest of Feelings,
Care-a-lot
* And earth aren't far apart
* They differ in some ways, some ways not
* 'Cause home is in your heart
* Home is in your heart
* Home is in your heart
You're welcome to stay in the Forest of Feelings as long as you like.
Thank you, Brave Heart, but the sooner we leave the better.
If we don't hurry,
Care-a-lot may not be there when we get back.
We have to find a way back to Earth.
To help stop the evil spirit from taking all the feelings from everybody.
Come on, everybody.
Where?
If there is a way out of the Forest of Feelings, we'll help you find it.
This way.
There!
The spell is cast.
Now everyone in town will know the loneliness they've made me feel.
Not quite.
Look!
These two small children still care very much about everyone, except you.
But they were to fall under my spell.
Ah, but those--those soft little bears shield them from your spells with their love and caring.
Let them go!
I'm even now!
Are you?
What about all the others?
Others?
All the others that you have not yet cast your spells on.
All the others that still care.
I've gotten even with the whole town.
That's all I wanted.
The others will come after you for what you've done.
What should I do?
You must finish it.
Go ahead, say it!
SPIRIT: This spell will seek out the children and bring them to us at any cost.
But isn't there another way?
No! They must be taught a lesson!
A lesson for the children.
A lesson for the town!
A lesson for everyone.
What do you mean, "everyone"?
Now go!
You said, "a lesson."
What kind of lesson?
Never mind that.
You must now collect the ingredients for your next spell.
WISH BEAR: There's nothing ahead to tell us where we are,
Tenderheart.
Bear overboard!
Bedtime Bear went to sleep and fell overboard.
Look!
Hi. I think you've lost something.
LOVE-A-LOT BEAR:
Oh, thank you very much.
I'm sure Bedtime Bear will thank you, too, when he wakes up.
COZY HEART PENGUIN:
No thanks needed.
I'm Cozy Heart Penguin.
Helping someone in need is what warms my heart and keeps me cozy.
Well, it must work,
Cozy Heart.
This water's freezing!
I love it!
First we have to find
Kim and Jason, and then...
Uh-oh.
Something's pulling at the wheel.
Tenderheart, why are you turning here?
I'm not!
The boat's turning by itself!
LOVE-A-LOT BEAR: We're caught in some kind of whirlpool!
ALL: Whoa!
ALL: Whoa!
WISH BEAR:
Somebody do something!
A rope!
Throw me a rope!
Do as she says!
Quick!
Guide this rope,
Little Star.
Oh, Champ Bear, we're saved!
May I introduce the strongest, most fearsome creature in the entire
Forest of Feelings.
Lotsa Heart Elephant.
Hello.
Hey, you're a lot smaller than you sound.
It's true that I'm not big, but it's amazing what you can do if you really put your heart into it.
(LAUGHING) Sometimes I even startle myself.
It's not going to work.
Even the Spell can't defeat them.
The Spell was just having a little sport.
The children are his true goal.
Perhaps a sprinkle of toadstool mold would speed things up.
Grumpy Bear!
Ouch! Ow, ow, ow.
The Caring Meter is down to five.
If it reaches zero,
Care-a-lot is finished!
And no one will care anymore.
Any luck fixing the Rainbow Rescue Beam?
I think I used up all my good luck getting this far.
Maybe your luck's run out, but not mine!
I need a piece that looks like this.
Whoa!
Try that.
It's Baby Hugs' lollipop.
Perfect!
You know, Baby Hugs and Tugs are gonna make fine Care Bears one of these days.
You rest there while I scout up ahead.
ALL: Whew.
While Brave Heart's gone, let's play a guessing game.
What am I?
I don't know.
Look out!
Help!
Let us go!
Help!
Oh, no!
Let us go!
Charge!
Help!
All right, you asked for it!
Whoa.
Let them go!
Swift Heart!
Oh.
Phew.
Whoa!
Let's get out of here!
Come on, Swift Heart.
SWIFT HEART RABBIT:
I'm way ahead of you.
Oh, no!
That's the most unfriendly tree I've ever seen.
Well, thanks to you,
Swift Heart, we're safe for now.
FRIEND BEAR: There's a serious task at hand, Swift Heart.
It seems that the evil spirit is after Kim and Jason.
An evil spirit in the Forest of Feelings?
We'll fill you in as we go.
Let's get moving.
TENDERHEART: Lotsa Heart, do you think this river might lead us down to Earth?
It has to go somewhere.
Hang on, everyone, we're going for a ride.
ALL: Whoa!
Look, a cave!
TENDERHEART:
I can't see a thing.
VOICE: Steer to the left!
TENDERHEART:
Who said that?
FUNSHINE BEAR: Not me.
LOVE-A-LOT BEAR:
Neither did I.
WISH BEAR: It wasn't me.
VOICE: It was me!
I said it!
TENDERHEART:
Who are you?
VOICE: Don't ask questions.
Steer left quick!
TENDERHEART: Hang on, everyone!
Phew, that was close.
You almost smashed right into a big rock.
Look!
I see light up ahead.
A raccoon?
No wonder you could see in the dark.
Not just a raccoon.
Bright Heart Raccoon.
I can usually see my way through anything.
WISH BEAR: Waterfalls ahead!
We better do something quick.
Care Bears!
Ready?
Now!
Whoa!
Well done, Care Bears.
LOTSA HEART: Let's hear it for the Care Bears!
ALL: Hip, hip, hurray!
Hip, hip, hurray!
Oh, no!
Run!
Brave Heart?
Whoa!
Oh, no!
Are you okay, Kim?
Jason, we've got to run.
Where? We're trapped.
And that bird knows it, too.
We can't reach them!
You're right, Secret Bear.
Our only hope is a Care Bear Stare.
I just hope it works.
There's only two of us.
Right again.
We've got to try.
Care Bears stare!
The two of us aren't enough!
Oh, no!
Look!
Care Bears stare!
That was magnificent.
Your friends arrived just in time.
Jason, Kim!
You're all right!
Thanks to our new friends.
I know exactly what you mean.
I think things will get a lot easier now that we're together, Brave Heart.
I couldn't agree with you more, Lotsa Heart.
Soon you'll be out of the Forest of Feelings.
Then your journey will really begin.
You're not coming with us?
Well, uh, yes, if you think we could help.
Glad to have you along.
We can use all the help we can get.
Well, in that case...
* We're calling for
 the loyal hearts
* Wherever they may be
* We're calling for
 the proud hearts
* To come and follow me
* We're calling for
 the gentle hearts
* To keep us company
* And it would be
 a treat heart
* If you would follow me
* 'Cause there's
 a job to be done
* We're gonna need everyone
* Because nobody
 can do it alone
* We'll need the swift
 and the small
* We'll need the strong
 and the tall
* 'Cause everyone has
 a strength of their own
* And when you put it
 all together
* Then there's a power
 no one can deny
* It's the power to share,
 it's the power to care
* 'Cause when you care
 you're not afraid to try
* Yeah!
* And when you put it
 all together
* Then there's a power
 no one can deny
* It's the power to share,
 it's the power to care
* When you care,
 you're not afraid to try *
SPIRIT: They're on their way.
Here?
You'll be ready for them.
How?
By completing your final spell.
Final spell?
Yes.
You must gather the elements quickly.
When those two children arrive, they must be all that is left of caring in this world.
You don't mean...
Yes!
Everyone must be taught the lesson.
But...
Don't you see, Nicholas?
It's too late to stop now.
You must finish what you started!
There's no turning back!
MR. CHERRYWOOD: It was
 hard to believe that only
a short time ago this was a place
 of happiness and joy.
Now, without love
to keep it alive, it had become a home of fear, loneliness and ruin.
Time was running out
 for the Care Bears.
Nicholas and the evil spirit
had to be stopped before they cast
 their final spell.
A world without caring?
This doesn't look like the Earth you talked about.
We've got to stop it before it gets worse.
I don't think this place could get any worse.
Nicholas and the spirit must be around here somewhere.
We've got to find them as quickly as possible.
I suggest we split up.
I agree, Tenderheart.
The first ones to spot them, warn the others.
Okay, let's go get them.
Jason, do you still have the key that I gave you?
Sure do.
Good. Now, promise me you and Kim will stay as far away from Nicholas and the spirit as you can.
But I wanna help.
You can help best by guarding that key.
B-But...
If we lose that key, Jason, we can never win.
I understand, Tenderheart.
You can count on me.
Three apple cores.
Just what I need.
One spider's web.
My list is almost complete.
A few more items, a few magic words, and presto, a world without love.
Love-a-lot, did you hear that?
We have to get word to the others before it's too late.
Hmm. Let's see. Apple cores, spider's web, milkweed pod...
Huh?
A cigar butt.
I almost missed it.
Now, one last thing to find.
BOTH: Phew.
BOY: There they go.
Phew. That was close.
Oh, no! Run away!
Hurry up! Look out!
Run away!
Get away! Oh, dear!
Watch out!
* Run for cover
* Don't stop to look around
* Nothing to do
* But hide someplace
 where we cannot be found
Don't make a sound.
Look out!
Be careful.
Here he comes!
Whoa!
Run away!
* Look out, he's after you
* You ought to take care,
 but take care where you go
* It's a nightmare coming true
* The evil that's spreading
 is starting to grow
* Your friends are doing
 all they can do
* But what about you?
* How can we help
 this unfortunate soul?
* How can we stop him?
 He's out of control
* Running and hiding
 to stay out of sight
* Running and hiding,
 it doesn't seem right
* Look out! Watch out!
 Hurry, get away!
* Running and hiding
 and running again
* Running and running,
 oh, please make it end
* Isn't there some way
 to make him our friend?
* The spirit's got
 a hold on Nicholas
* He's forgot about feelings
 and friends
* Look out, he's after you
* It's a nightmare coming true
* When will
 this bad dream end?
* He's not himself,
 he's turning mean
* He's been on a path
 of terrible wrath
* No kid's ever seen
SWIFT HEART RABBIT: Hey!
* Friends are there
 to help you out
* Because they care
 and there's no doubt
* That if you're scared,
 they'll lend a hand
* Till you're prepared
 to make a stand
* This power's wrong,
 but incredibly strong
* If only we could
 make him understand
* Look out, watch out!
 Look out! Look out!
* Look out! Watch out!
* What can you do
 if there's only two of you?
* What can you do
 if there's only two of you?
* What can you do
 if there's only two of you? *
Huh?
Icky, sticky bubble gum!
The last ingredient
I need for my final spell.
Let them try and stop me now!
Swift Heart, are you all right?
You bet, Friend Bear.
It takes more than that to slow me down.
Where are Kim and Jason?
Maybe they're hiding and are afraid to show themselves.
TENDERHEART:
Okay, Brave Heart.
You round up your friends and try to find Kim and Jason.
Care Bears, follow me.
What are you going to do,
Tenderheart?
We have to try and get through to Nicholas.
And make him believe that we really do care about him.
And that he really cares about everyone else.
With a Care Bear Stare?
That's right, Cozy Heart.
I wish there was some way we could express our feelings like that.
There's always a way to let others share your feelings,
Gentle Heart, always.
Let's go.
We don't have much time.
MR. CHERRYWOOD: It was going
to take every ounce of caring that the Care Bears
could muster to reach Nicholas.
But as you remember,
 they were two bears short.
Grumpy Bear and Good Luck Bear were still in Care-a-lot
 trying to fix the Rainbow
Rescue Beam, or what was left of it.
I just need a little more time.
That's the one thing we don't have.
The Caring Meter has fallen to three.
In no time, it'll fall to zero.
And that's the end of Care-a-lot.
We've got to get down there and help!
Good.
Now, the final ingredient.
SPIRIT: Quickly!
Why are you stopping?
I--I--I don't want...
You don't want to?
You must!
You can't care about anything!
No!
SPIRIT: You've gone too far!
Too far to stop!
You can't stop!
You are beyond this!
TENDERHEART: Stop!
Nicholas!
You're too late.
Too late!
The last spell is cast!
We care about everyone, even when they don't care about us.
And right now, the one we care about most is you, Nicholas!
You!
Care Bears, get ready.
Care Bears, stare!
You don't care!
Whoa!
SPIRIT: Now for the very last two children.
COZY HEART PENGUIN:
What happened in there?
SHARE BEAR: The Care Bear
Stare didn't work!
The spirit's power is too strong!
Brave Heart, where are Kim and Jason?
We can't find them anywhere.
Uh-oh. Look!
Nicholas?
Where are they?
As long as Kim and Jason still care, his spell's not complete.
You mean, you can still save him?
We can still save him.
But how?
Just feel it!
Care Bears?
Ha!
Well, what do you know?
The Rainbow Rescue Beam worked.
See? We just needed a little luck.
GRUMPY BEAR:
Looks like we're gonna need more than that.
Where are they?
Where are you hiding the boy and girl?
You don't know what you're doing, Nicholas.
Listen to your heart, and you'll find the truth.
Where are they?
Care Bears stare!
Too late.
Tenderheart's right.
We can do it, but we have to do it together.
Do what?
Okay, everybody.
Uh, uh, everybody, uh...
That's it!
Everybody call!
SPIRIT: No!
Nicholas!
Kim, Jason, no!
It's them!
It's the children.
Nicholas!
We care about you.
We used to be like you.
We thought nobody cared.
But we were wrong.
Now we want to be your friends, Nicholas, and make sure you're never alone again.
Believe us, Nicholas, believe us.
I--I--I believe you.
No, you can't!
SPIRIT: Don't do it.
Stop.
You don't care!
They don't care!
Stop!
Please, don't close me!
Jason, the key.
The key!
I--I--I can't hold it much longer!
No!
Oh, no!
Hold on, Nicholas.
Thank you.
MR. CHERRYWOOD: And so it was
 that the love and caring
of the Care Bears, their new friends,
 and the two children
 saved the day.
KIM: I guess Care-a-lot is safe and sound again.
And as long as
Care-a-lot is safe, so is the world below it.
Mr. Fetuccini!
I almost forgot.
He's still under that sleeping spell.
It's showtime!
Mr. Fetuccini!
I'm sorry.
Nicholas, I just had the most wonderful dream.
I dreamed I changed my poster, so that's what I'm going to do.
Now it'll read:
"Fetuccini and Nicholas."
So what do you say, huh?
A partnership.
A part-- A part...
Oh, all right.
"Nicholas and Fetuccini."
Oh, thank you so much.
You won't be disappointed,
I promise.
I can't believe this.
I owe it all to Care Bears and...
To who?
Yeah, uh, they're, um, friends, Mr. Fetuccini.
Just friends.
Friends! That's what it's all about, Nicholas, my boy.
That's what it's all about.
MR. CHERRYWOOD:
 No matter what happened,
Nicholas now knew that someone
 would be watching over him
 at all times.
And most important of all,
Nicholas had learned that
the best way to make friends is to be a friend yourself.
TENDERHEART:
Our friends from the Forest of Feelings have proven to everyone that there's always a way to show that you care.
And so the purpose of this festive occasion is to let all bear witness to the inauguration of our friends into the Care Bear family.
(IT'S GREAT TO BE
 IN THE CARE BEAR FAMILY
PLAYING)

NICHOLAS: And now,
The Amazing Nicholas will pull a dove out of his hat.
That's my boy.
Bravo, Nicky!
Hey, Jason, aren't parents great?
Yeah.
MR. CHERRYWOOD:
And so Kim and Jason found the parents they wanted so very much and lived happily ever after.
And a fine story that was,
Mr. Cherrywood.
My favorite,
Mrs. Cherrywood.
But they never stay awake long enough for the end.
Now they'll never know what eventually became of Nicholas.
I guess all they need to know is that he, too, lived happily ever after.
Happier than I ever thought
I could be.
Nicholas, these children should have been in bed ages ago.
MRS. CHERRYWOOD: What am I ever going to do with you?
Care for me,
Mrs. Cherrywood.
Just care for me.

When the child was a child, it walked with its arms swinging.
It wanted the stream to be a river, the river a torrent... and this puddle to be the sea.
When the child was a child, it didn't know it was a child.
Everything was full of life, and all life was one.
When the child was a child, it had no opinion about anything.
It had no habits.
It often sat cross-legged, took off running... had a cowlick in its hair, and didn't pull a face... when photographed.
Look.
The consolation of lifting one's head out here in the open... of seeing the colours enlightened by the sun... in all men's eyes.
At last mad, no longer alone.
At last mad, at last redeemed.
At last mad, at last at peace.
At last an internal light.
We're approaching Berlin Tegel, the no-smoking sign has been turned on.
Please stop smoking until you're inside the airport.
There's a little house with two floors and a terrace.
And every day we go bathing.
The man who lives there is called Peter...
Pretty picture.
Nothing good to see on TV.
You stumble over your colours, and are never punctual.
Still the same smell. But dustier.
She collected everything.
Stamps, postcards.
Even U-Bahn tickets.
She never threw anything away.
Mother. My mother.
She never was.
My father...
My father was my father.
She is dead.
No tears, no grief. Maybe later.
Dependant on everybody.
My sister. I have to get out of here.
She's never loved me.
And you also just pretend.
Be glad that they forgot about you.
Want to die immediately, don't want to go on living.
My God, what will become of the boy?
He's only got music on his mind.
What does he want now?
I already bought him a guitar.
Does he wants drums now?
I'm slowly getting fed up with it.
Won't he ever grow up?
No really, I'm getting fed up.
I don't want to go on with this.
No really, this has to stop some time.
I can't help him any more.
No wonder, he only learnt rock 'n' roll.
Maybe he'll get a grip on himself one day.
When the child was a child, it was the time of these questions:
Why am I me, and why not you?
Why am I here, and why not there?
When did time begin, and where does space end?
Isn't life under the sun just a dream?
Isn't what I see, hear and smell just a mirage of the world before the world?
Does evil actually exist, and people who are really evil?
How can it be that I, the one I am, wasn't there before I was there... and that some time I, the one I am, no longer will be the one I am?
The child needs oxygen.
Breathe deep down.
If I could only suffer in her place.
- It hurts.
Iùll be over soon.
- Iùs almost over.
Poor little mite, I'm anxious to see you.
I wonder what you look like.
You bastard. You bastard.
- Women will fuck up your life.
Blackie, I think I got lost.
We wanted to go to the cemetery...
Well?
Sunrise at 7.22 am, sunset at 4.28 pm.
Moonrise at 7.04 pm, moonset...
Level of the Havel and the Spree...
20 years ago today, a Soviet jet fighter crashed into the lakes at Spandau.
50 years ago, there were...
- The Olympic Games.
200 years ago, the first balloon flew over the city.
Like the fugitives the other day.
- And today...
Lilienthaler Chaussee:
A man slows down... and looks over his shoulder into space.
Someone who wants to put an end to it... put first-issue stamps on his farewell letters.
A different one on each.
Then he spoke English with an American soldier... for the first time since his schooldays, fluently.
Just before dashing his head against the wall, a prisoner said: "Now."
Instead of the station's name, the guard... suddenly shouted: "Tierra del Fuego."
- Nice.
An old man was reading the Odyssey to a child... and the young listener stopped blinking his eyes.
And what do you have to tell?
A passer-by who, in the rain, folded her umbrella and was drenched.
A schoolboy who described to his teacher a fern growing... and the astounded teacher.
A blind woman, who groped her watch, feeling my presence.
Iùs great to live by the spirit, to testify for eternity... only what is spiritual in people's minds.
But sometimes I'm fed up with my spiritual existence... of forever hovering above.
I'd like to feel a weight in me... to end the infinity, and to tie me to earth.
I'd like at each step, each gust of wind... to be able to say:
"Now, now and now."
No longer:
"Forever" and "For eternity".
Sit at the empty place at a card table, be greeted... even by a nod.
Every time we participated, it was a pretence.
Wrestling, allowing a hip to be put out, in pretence... catching a fish in pretence.
In pretence, sitting at tables drinking and eating in pretence.
Having lambs roasted and wine served in the tents in the desert... only in pretence.
I don't have to beget a child or plant a tree... but it would be nice, coming home after a long day... to feed the cat like Philip Marlowe... to have a fever, blackened fingers from the newspaper.
To be excited not only by the mind, but by a meal.
By the line of a neck, by an ear.
To lie.
Through one's teeth.
As you're walking, to feel your bones moving along.
At last to guess instead of always knowing.
To be able to say:
"Ah" and "Oh" and "Hey"... instead of: "Yes and amen."
- Yes.
To be able to enthuse for evil... to draw all the demons from the passers-by... and to chase them out into the world.
To be a savage.
Or to feel how it is to take off your shoes under the table... and to wriggle your toes, barefoot, like that...
Stay alone.
Let things happen. Keep serious.
We can only be savages in as much as we keep serious.
Do no more than look.
Assemble, testify, preserve.
Remain spirit.
Keep your distance. Keep your word.
Look, a convertible.
You don't buy that, you steal it.
Or iùs stolen from you.
- Imagine...
Open the roof, leave the smog behind.
- In a pimpmobile.
Tell me, muse, the storyteller... he who has been thrust to the edge of the world... both an infant and an ancient, and through him reveal Everyman.
With time, those who listened to me became my readers.
They no longer sit in a circle, but apart... and one doesn't know anything about the other.
I'm an old man, with a broken voice... but the story still rises from the depths... and the slowly opened mouth... repeats it as clearly as it does powerfully.
A liturgy for which no one needs to be initiated... to the meaning of the words and sentences.
Maybe she doesn't have the money to see another doctor.
4 years since I saw her, she's been sick for 2.
When will you pray with your own words, and not for eternal life?
And then these young girls make eyes at men...
So why am I living? Why am I living?
How will I pay?
With my small pension.
You're lost, it can go on for a long time.
Abandoned by parents, betrayed by wife.
Friend in another town, your children only recall your stutter.
You could hit yourself as you look in the mirror.
Whaùs that?
Whaùs going on?
I'm still there.
If I want it, if I only want it.
I must want it, then I can get out of it again.
I let myself go,
I can drag myself out again.
Of course, mother was right.
Hey, two Marks.
- No, iùs a beer top.
Nonsense, leùs pull it up.
Only 10 Pfennigs.
"You bet?" was great last night.
- It wasn't on last night.
A few days ago, or a month...
I'm all alone, just mad on my own... three at play, thaùll be the day.
5 years ago.
- And they lived happily ever after.
Marion, not like that. Mon dieu.
What is this?
With a swing, not with force.
What are you doing?
Don't dangle, fly.
You are an angel.
- For heaven's sake.
And for my sake, too.
I can't fly with these things.
- Yes, you can.
Iùs easier with wings than without.
- Not with these chicken feathers.
What did she say?
- These wings bother her.
Marion, just imagine you're a dove.
- You bunch of sparrows.
What are you playing at?
Sounds like a firemen's ball.
Thaùs enough.
Concentrate, Marion.
She works hard with those chicken feathers.
Marion, make an effort.
- Make an effort.
Of course, I make an effort.
What do you think I'm doing?
I'd have fallen on your heads long ago, if I didn't make an effort.
One moment, please.
Hold everything. We can't pay the rent and the electricity.
We're broke.
So tomorrow we'll take things down, pull the caravans to winter quarters.
The bailiff's been.
This is it for the circus this year.
I'm sorry.
Iùs over. Not even a season.
Once again, no time to bring something to an end.
Tonight the last night of my good old number.
And iùs a full moon.
And the trapeze artist comes tumbling down...
Tais-toi. Be quiet.
I never imagined it like that, the farewell to the circus.
The last evening, no one shows up, you play like fools... and I fly around the ring like a poor chicken.
And then I'm a waitress again.
Merde.
Moments like that, like right now... a beautiful memory in 10 years time.
Time will heal everything, but what if time was the illness?
As if sometimes one had to lean over to go on living.
To live... A look is enough.
The circus... I'll miss it.
Iùs funny.
Iùs the end, and I don't feel a thing.
An angel passes by.
I must stop having a bad conscience.
As if pain had no past.
It always stops when iùs only just starting... to be too good to be true.
At last outside, in the city.
Find out who I am, who I have become.
Most of the time,
I'm too aware to be sad.
I waited an eternity to hear a loving word.
Then I went abroad.
Someone who'd say:
"I love you so much today."
That would be wonderful.
I look up and the world appears before my eyes... and fills my heart.
As a child,
I wanted to live on an island.
A woman alone, gloriously alone.
Yes, thaùs it.
Everything so empty, incompatible.
Emptiness, fear.
La peur, la peur, la peur...
Fear.
Like a small animal, lost in the woods.
Who are you?
I don't know any more.
But I do know:
I will no longer be a trapeze artist.
Must not cry. Thaùs how it is.
It happens, not always as you'd like it.
Emptiness, such emptiness...
What shall I do?
Not think any more.
Just be there.
Berlin... Here I'm a stranger, and yet iùs all so familiar.
You can't get lost, you always end up at the Wall.
I'm waiting for my photo at a machine, and it comes out with another face.
That could be the beginning of a story.
The faces... I'd like to see faces.
Maybe I'll find a job as a waitress.
This evening scares me.
Iùs silly, fear makes me sick.
Only part of me worries, the other part doesn't believe in it.
How should I live?
Maybe thaùs not the question.
How should I think?
I know so little. Maybe because I'm always just curious.
Sometimes I think so wrongly... because I'm thinking as if I was talking to someone else.
Inside closed eyes, close the eyes again.
Then even the stones come alive.
To be with the colours.
Les couleurs. The colours.
Neon lights in the evening sky, the red and yellow S-Bahn.
Longing... longing.
I only need to be ready.
Longing for a wave of love that would stir in me.
Thaùs what makes me clumsy, the absence of desire.
Desire to love.
Desire to love.
Don't stare.
Have you never seen anyone die?
I stink of gasoline.
I can't just... It was all so clear.
The way they're standing there, staring at me.
I should have told her yesterday that I'm sorry...
I can't simply...
I've still got so much to do...
As I came up the mountain out of the misty valley into the sun...
The fire on the cattle range, the potatoes in the ashes... the boathouse floating on the lake.
The Southern Cross. The Far East.
The Great North. The Wild West.
The Great Bear Lake.
The Tristan de Cunha Island.
The Mississippi Delta. Stromboli.
The old houses of Charlottenburg.
Albert Camus.
The morning light.
The eyes of the child.
Swimming near the waterfall.
The spots of the first drops of rain.
The sun.
The bread and wine. Hopping.
Easter. The veins of the leaves.
The blowing grass.
The colours of the stones.
The pebbles on the stream's bed.
The white tablecloth outdoors.
The dream of the house in the house.
The dear one asleep in the next room.
The peaceful Sunday.
The horizon.
The light from the room in the garden.
The night flight.
Riding a bicycle with no hands.
The beautiful stranger.
My father.
My mother.
My wife.
My child.
The world seems to be sinking into dust, but I recount... as in the beginning... in my sing-song voice, which sustains me... saved by the tale from present troubles... and protected for the future.
Finished with the sweeping over the centuries as in the past.
Now I can think only day by day.
My heroes are no longer the warriors and kings... but the things of peace, one equal to the other.
The drying onions equal to the tree trunk crossing the marsh.
But no one has so far succeeded in singing an epic of peace.
What is wrong with peace that its inspiration doesn't endure... and that its story is hardly told?
Must I give up now?
If I do give up, then mankind will lose its storyteller.
And once mankind loses its storyteller... it will also lose its childhood.
I cannot find the Potsdamer Platz.
Here? This can't be it.
Potsdamer Platz, thaùs where Cafz' Josti used to be.
In the afternoons, I went there to chat and to drink a coffee... and to watch the crowd.
Before that I smoked my cigar at Loese and Wolf... a renowned tobacconist.
Just across from here.
This can't be the Potsdamer Platz.
And no one whom you can ask.
It was a lively place.
Tramways, horse-drawn carriages... and two cars:
Mine and that of the chocolate shop.
The Wertheim store was here, too.
And then suddenly, the flags appeared.
Here...
The whole Platz was covered with them.
And the people weren't friendly anymore... and the police wasn't either.
I will not give up... as long as I haven't found the Potsdamer Platz.
Where are my heroes?
Where are you, my children?
Where are my own, the dull-witted... the original ones?
Name me, muse, the immortal singer... who, abandoned by his mortal audience...
Iost his voice.
He who, from angel of poetry that he was... became the organ grinder ignored or mocked... outside, on the threshold of no man's land.
20 Marks, 40 Marks, 80 Marks.
In a week I could have 500.
Off to the south.
What a crazy idea to stand here.
Too much traffic.
Idiot, three times he's been this way.
I want to get out of here.
If anyone recognises me, I'll be thrown out of secondary school.
I need Klaus, he'd take good care of me.
He was so good, too good.
And now he's dead.
Are there still borders?
More than ever.
Each street has its own border line.
Between each plot there's a no man's land strip... hidden by a hedge or by a ditch.
Who dares, will fall on booby traps... or be hit by laser beams.
The trout in the water are really torpedoes.
Every proprietor, or even tenant... sticks up his nameplate like a coat of arms... and studies the paper like a world leader.
The German people are divided into as many states as there are individuals.
And these small states are mobile.
Each one takes his own with him... and demands a toll when another wants to enter.
In the form of a fly in amber or a leather bottle.
So much for the border.
But one can only enter each state with the right passwords.
Today's German soul can only be conquered and governed... by he who arrives at each small state with the password.
Fortunately, no one is now able to do so.
So everyone migrates and raises his own flag all over the world.
Even their children shake their rattles... and trail their filth around in circles.
The medals reflect the best.
They were elegant, those brothers.
Could I have light?
- But no flame.
You're welcome.
- Thank you.
The only thing I shall miss from the outside... from the realm of light, will be sparrows.
Money buys happiness.
How to live?
The Man in the Golden Helmet is a swindle.
You're not natives, you're all refugees.
You're wet from swimming.
I've been sitting here since this morning...
I'm so cold and bored.
Wind in the face, the first snow in the air.
Water in the gutter.
The balcony with the beautiful stranger.
Real ones. They look like it.
They could be real ones.
Some stole food from the dogs in the camps.
That would take the grin off your face.
Don't be too sure yet.
The Frenchman.
I met him in the streets.
"Berlin won't be there any more,"
Constant said.
The house was half gone.
Some of it still stood. For how long?
Yes, I can still see this woman... who was standing up there in the ruins shaking the duvet.
When was that?
May... June 1945.
Is he good at what he's doing?
It seems so.
I'd like to see it.
Maybe he'll give it to me.
Come, I'll show you something else.
When the child was a child it choked on spinach, peas... rice pudding and steamed cauliflower... and now eats all of that, and not just because it has to.
When the child was a child, it woke up once in a strange bed... but now time and time again.
Many people seemed beautiful then, nowadays iùs only the odd one.
It had a precise picture of Paradise, and now can only guess at it.
It couldn't imagine nothingness, and today shudders at the idea.
When the child was a child, it played with enthusiasm... and now it can only muster it when it concerns its work.
Do you recall our first visit here?
History had not yet begun.
We let mornings and evenings go by, and waited.
It took a long time for the river to find its bed and the stagnant water to flow.
Valley of the primeval river.
One day, I still remember... the glacier melted and the icebergs drifted to the north.
A tree passed by, still green, with an empty birÔs nest.
Only the fish had leapt over a myriad of years.
Then came the moment when the bees drowned.
Some time later, the two stags fought on the bank.
Then the flies and the antlers, like branches, flowing down the river.
All that ever grew again was grass... growing over the bodies of wild cats, wild boar and buffaloes.
One morning, out of the savannah, its forehead smeared with grass... appeared the biped, our image, so long awaited.
And its first word was a shout.
Was it "ah" or "oh", or was it merely a groan?
We were at last able to laugh, for the first time.
Through this man's shout and that of his followers, we learnt to speak.
A long story.
Sun, lightning, thunder in the sky... and below on earth, the firesides, the leaps... the round dances, the signs, the writing.
Then one broke through the cycle and ran straight ahead.
As long as he ran straight ahead, swerving sometimes perhaps from joy... he seemed free, and again we could laugh with him.
But then, suddenly, he ran zigzag, and stones flew.
With his flight began the history of wars. It is still going on.
But the story of the grass, the sun, the leaps and the shouts... is still going on, too.
Do you know how one day the road was built here... which the next day saw the Napoleon retreat... and was paved later on?
Today it is covered with grass and sunk in like a Roman road... with the tank tracks.
But we weren't even spectators.
We"ve always been too few.
You really want...
- To conquer a history for myself.
What my timeless downward look has taught me...
I want to transmute, to sustain a glance... a short shout, a sour smell.
I've been outside long enough.
Absent long enough.
Long enough out of the world.
Let me enter the history of the world.
Or just hold an apple in my hand.
Look, those feathers, there on the water, already vanished.
Look, the tyre marks on the asphalt, and now the cigarette butt rolling.
The primeval river has dried up, and only today's raindrops still quiver.
Down with the world behind the world.
Only the Roman roads still lead somewhere... only the oldest traces lead anywhere.
Where is the top of the pass here?
Even the plains, even Berlin, has its hidden passes.
And iùs only there that my country, the country of the tale, begins.
Why doesn't everyone see from childhood on... the passes, doors and crevices... on the ground and above in the sky.
If everyone saw them, there would be history without murder or war.
This time I'm doing it.
Funny I'm so calm.
Why red socks with black shoes?
Stupid.
Foggy, cold.
Put on a pullover, afraid to be cold.
Very good jacket. A bargain.
Just the pockeùs torn.
She gave it to me.
Pebbles on the roof. Why?
So it doesn't fly away? Nonsense.
Once I'd like to fly.
The plane circles over Berlin, one day iùll crash.
Lùs cold. My hands were always warm. A good sign.
It crackles underfoot.
What time is it?
The sun's setting. Logical, the west.
Now I know where the west is.
I always took the U-Bahn to the east to go home... bought 10 tickets, saved a Mark.
The sun in my back, on the left the star.
Thaùs good: Sun and a star.
Her little feet.
Hopping from one foot to the other.
She danced so sweetly.
We were all alone.
Has she got my letter?
I don't want her to read it.
Berlin means nothing to me...
Havel? Is that a lake?
Over there Wedding, or what?
The East is everywhere really.
Strange people, they"re shouting.
I don't care.
All these thoughts.
I'd really rather not think any more.
I'm going, why?
Leave me alone, you swine.
- Mother. Mother.
I'll never make it tonight.
No trapeze on full-moon nights.
Not the last time, the very last time.
I should wake up from this dream.
The end of the circus. Fini.
And once again I feel as if night were falling inside of me.
Fear... Fear of death.
Why not death?
The essential at times... just being beautiful, and nothing more.
To look at oneself in the mirror is to see oneself think.
So what do you think?
I think I still have the right to be afraid, but not to talk about it.
You"re not yet blind, the heart is still beating.
And now you"re crying after all.
You"d like to cry like a very sad little girl.
Do you know why you"re crying?
For whom?
Not for me.
I don't know for whom.
I'd like to know. I know nothing.
I'm a little bit afraid.
Lùs gone, gone away. Lùll come back.
It doesn't matter.
Just to be able to say, like right now, I'm happy.
I have a story, and I'll go on having one.
There it is again, this feeling of well-being... as if inside my body a hand was softly tightening.
When the child was a child, it was the time of these questions:
Why am I me, and why not you?
Why am I here, and why not there?
When did time begin, and where does space end?
Isn't life under the sun just a dream?
Isn't that Columbo?
- Don't think so.
Not with that moth-eaten coat.
- He wouldn't be out here.
Well?
- I'm going to enter the river.
An old human expression that I only understand today.
Now or never, moment of the ford.
But there is no other bank, there is only the river.
Into the ford of time, the ford of death.
We"re not yet born, so leùs descend.
To look is not to look from on high, but at eye-level.
First, I'll take a bath.
Then I'll be shaved by a Turkish barber... who will also massage me down to the fingertips.
Then I'll buy a newspaper and read it from the headlines to the horoscope.
On the first day, I'll only be served.
For requests, ask the neighbour.
If someone stumbles over my legs, he'll apologise.
If pushed, I'll push back.
The bartender will find me an empty table.
A car will stop, and the mayor will give me a lift.
I'll be familiar to everyone, suspect to no one.
I won't say a word, will understand every language.
This will be my first day.
- But none of it will be true.
I'll take her in my arms, and she'll take me in her arms.
I think he's drunk.
- Yes.
Leùs go.
Lùs got a taste.
Now I begin to understand.
Is that red?
- Yes.
Did you hurt yourself?
Is today a good day?
- Lùs okay.
And the pipes?
- They"re yellow.
Yellow. What about him?
- He's grey-blue.
Grey-blue. This one?
- Purple.
This one?
- Orange. Ochre.
Ochre or orange?
- Ochre.
Yellow, red... this one?
- Lùs green.
And whaùs that over the eye?
- Thaùs blue.
Blue.
Is it very cold?
- Lùll soon be over.
I'd love to have a coffee.
Do you have money?
- Yes... no.
I'm glad everything is fine today.
Beautiful.
Coffee.
- With milk and sugar?
Black.
When the child was a child, it lived on apples and bread, that was enough.
And it is still that way.
When the child was a child, berries fell only like berries into its hand.
And they still do now.
Fresh walnuts made its tongue raw, and they still do now.
Atop each mountain it was longing for a higher mountain.
And in each city it was longing for a bigger city.
And it still does.
Reached in the treetop for the cherries... as excitedly as it still does today.
Was shy in front of strangers, and it still is.
Waited for the first snow, and still waits that way.
When the child was a child, it threw a stick like a lance into a tree.
And iùs still quivering there today.
How do I get to Akazienstrasse?
- Go up Potsdamer to Kleistpark.
Right at Grunewald past Gleditsch, no right turn at Goltzstrasse.
Turn left, and there you are.
This entrance is for the crew.
Extras, the other way, please.
Extra.
- Thaùs just what you look like.
They all want autographs.
Lousy cop.
Come on, Marion. Don't worry.
Lùll be alright.
I'll send you a postcard of the Eiffel Tower.
See you next season.
Don't forget the Alekan Circus.
Bye Archie, see you next year.
- Au revoir.
A thousand kisses.
I'll send you a parcel.
With some Camembert cheese?
I couldn't say who I am.
I don't have the slightest idea.
I am someone with no roots, no story, no country... and I like it that way.
I am here, I am free. I can imagine anything. Lùs all possible.
I only have to raise my eyes, and once again I become the world.
Now, in this very place... a feeling of happiness that I could always have.
What are you doing?
- I'm sitting.
Are you sad?
- No.
Are you sick?
- Yes.
Whaùs the matter?
- A need.
Oh, thaùs it.
A double knot is the only way to make it hold.
A need. A need of food perhaps.
- Or a need of drink.
She isn't gone, Cassiel. I know it.
I'll find her.
Something will happen, something important, tonight.
She'll teach me everything.
There are other suns then the one up in the sky, Cassiel.
In the deep of the night, spring will begin today.
Other wings will grow in place of the old ones.
Wings that will at last astound me.
It must finally become serious.
I've often been alone, but I've never lived alone.
When I was with someone
I was often happy... but at the same time it all seemed a coincidence.
These people were my parents, but it could have been others.
Why was the brown-eyed one my brother... and not the green-eyed boy on the opposite platform?
The taxi driver's daughter was my friend... but I might as well have put my arm around a horse's neck.
I was with a man, I was in love... and I might as well have left him there... and gone off with the stranger we met in the street.
Look at me, or don't.
Give me your hand, or don't.
No, don't give me your hand, and look away.
I think tonight is the new moon.
No night more peaceful.
No bloodshed in all the city.
I've never played with anyone and yet...
I never opened my eyes and thought:
Now iùs serious.
At last iùs becoming serious.
So I've grown older.
Was I the only one who wasn't serious?
Is it our times that are not serious?
I've never been lonely, neither alone, nor with someone else.
But I would have liked to be lonely.
Loneliness means: I am whole at last.
Now I can say it, as tonight I'm lonely at last.
I must put an end to coincidence.
The new moon of decision.
I don't know if there is a destiny, but there is a decision.
Decide.
Now we are the times.
Not only the whole town, the whole world is taking part in our decision.
Now we are more than the two of us.
We incarnate something.
We are sitting on the People's Square... and the whole place is full of people whose dream is the same as ours.
We are deciding everybody's game.
I am ready.
Now iùs your turn.
You hold the game in your hand.
Now or never.
You need me.
You will need me.
There is no greater story than ours, that of man and woman.
It will be a story of giants.
Invisible, transposable.
A story of new ancestors.
Look, my eyes.
They are the image of necessity... of the future of everyone in the place.
Last night I dreamt of a stranger.
Of my man.
Only with him could I be lonely... open up to him... wholly open, wholly for him... welcome him wholly into me... surround him with the labyrinth of shared happiness.
I know... iùs you.
Something happened.
It is still going on. It binds me.
It was true at night, and iùs true in the day, even more so now.
Who was who?
I was in her and she was around me.
Who in the world can claim that he was ever together with another being?
I am together.
No mortal child was begot, only an immortal common image.
I learned astonishment that night.
She came to take me home, and I found home.
It happened once.
Once, and therefore forever.
The image that we created will be with me when I die.
I will have lived within it.
The amazement about the two of us, amazement about man and woman... has turned me into a human being.
I know now... what... no angel knows.
Name the men, women and children who will look for me... me, their storyteller, their cantor, their spokesman... because they need me more than anything in the world.
We have embarked.
We moved here about a month ago.
My parents said it would be better... for me and my brother Eric.
They always say that when they want something.
Everything was different.
All the streets had different names.
All my friends were far away.
I was miserable.
I hated it... until I met my first friend--
Maurice.
I'll never, ever... have a friend like him again.
Damn it. I hate this.
You wanted a bigger house, a fixer-upper.
I wanted something both of us could do together... and you're never here.
You think I like commuting two hours to a job I hate?
I thought things would be different here.
I thought we'd spend time together.
You're the one who stopped working.
You think I like being a stranger to my kids?
I don't know.
Come on.
I’m not a monster, I’m a man.
I’m not sure there's a big difference.
Oh, great. Now I’m a monster.
Look, I just wish you'd be here when you're here.
Hi. My name's Danya Haye... and welcome to Channel 98 cable access--
All About Chicks.
-Today my guest is Lovey.
-Lonnie.
Oh, sorry, Lonnie. Right.
So, Lonnie, tell me.
Where are you from?
I’m from Fort Lauderdale, but I’m dying to go to L.A.
Mommy! Mommy!
Mommy!
Mommy, a monster!
A monster! Mommy, Mommy!
Mom, a monster!
Honey, are you all right?
OK. Now, the monster in your dream--
I was wide awake!
Well, it was probably just your mommy snoring.
This is no joke, Dad!
There was a real monster!
Really?
Honey, there's no such thing as monsters. it ran in from the hall... grabbed my ankle, and slid under my bed!
Under the bed?
Under the bed?
Yeah.
No, Dad, don't!
Yuck.
No monsters.
Sick.
I guess all the dust bunnies scared him away.
Bunny?
No, no.
No bunnies, no monsters.
There is nothing under your bed.
Now, why don't you just go to sleep, OK?
Can I have the flashlight?
Sure, honey. Would you get it?
Holly, I thought we--
I’ll get the... flashlight.
OK. Come on, tuck up.
You know,
I bet those monsters... are more afraid of you than you are of them.
I know.
Once you realize they don't exist... poof. They disappear.
Now, that's a lot of power.
Glen...
Don't burn up the batteries, OK?
I won't.
Good night, sweetheart.
All right, have a good sleep.
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Dad.
Good night, honey.
You think he heard us?
Of course he heard us.
That's what scared him.
Eric, did you take your vitamins?
-Yes.
-Good boy.
OK, no trading for Twinkies today.
Come on, Mom.
I don't do that.
Did you carry it over the lawn?
-Good morning.
-Hey, Mom.
Hi, honey.
Hey, Eric.
Hope whatever you watched on TV last night... was worth your allowance and two weeks of TV.
We found the sandwich, Brian.
What sandwich?
Brian Arthur Stevenson... you are the only person in this family... who eats peanut butter and onion sandwiches.
You think every time you get caught... you can just lie your way out of it?
Damn. Damn it!
The plumber's coming next week.
Great. I can leave him all these dishes.
Just keep telling yourself-- it's our dream house. it’s our dream house. it’s our dream house.
You're dead, mister.
-Hey, I didn't do anything.
-Just like the sandwich?
All right, all right.
Fine. I admit it.
I did have a sandwich, but
I did not have any ice cream.
Why do you always blame everything on me?
Somebody put scuff marks on the door kicking them open... and somebody puts gum under the table.
Brian, you are old enough to know the difference... between right and wrong.
Why don't you start acting it?
Why don't you start acting it?
Dad.
Aw, look at it this way.
They can only get better.
Great. Then can I stay home from school?
Are you sorry we moved?
I hate it here.
Guess you miss your friends, huh?
Mom, it's killing me.
You know, the realtor Mr. Coleman... he had a kid about your age.
Ronnie Coleman's a toad.
Well, he seemed like a nice kid to me.
Great. Then you can invite him over for milk and dead flies.
I would, but your father ate 'em all.
Brian!
My bike! You ran over it!
My car.
Whose fault is this, Brian?
No way.
I parked it right over there!
Right there!
Right, so before
I got in the car...
I went around and put the bike there myself?
Forget it, Charlie.
First my shirt, now this.
I’m fifteen minutes late here!
What do you expect me to do with my bike?
Look at it. it’s destroyed.
Well, you're gonna have to learn to ride it like that.
You're grounded for two weeks.
No TV for three, and you can forget about your allowance... until that car is paid up.
Glen, isn't that a little rough?
Holly, don't make me the villain here.
So, Dad, you mean to tell me that my bike is ruined... and your car has a little dent in it--
I’m being punished?
That's not fair!
Somebody put it there, Brian.
And it didn't slime you.
You sure?
Sure, I’m sure. I think
I’d know if I was slimed.
And it didn't go into the closet?
You know, like, to rip something off?
No.
What about your desk? it didn't do your geography homework, did it?
Look, Todd, I never would've told you about this, but--
OK, all right.
So, this is an exclusively under-the-bed phenomenon... we're dealing with here.
That's right-- exclusively under my bed. it really was a monster.
Really? What did it look like?
I don't know.
-Hi, Kiersten.
-Hi, Kiersten.
Hi.
Slow down!
Eric, Toad.
Why aren't you riding your bike?
What bike? Dad ran over it... because you left it in the driveway.
No way. Your bike? No way!
Look, I put it away.
Mom and Dad wouldn't touch it, so that only leaves you.
I didn't touch your bike.
I can hardly reach the pedals.
All right, that's it.
You lie to me, you starve.
My lunch!
You jerk!
I didn't do anything!
Oh, yeah, right.
And what about that ice cream?
You snuck some ice cream last night, too, didn't you?
Forget it.
Don't blame it on me.
The monster.
That's it.
That's what it was doing.
There are no monsters.
Who's Eric?
Who's the Eric who threw his lunch at me?
He did.
You Eric?
You want this back?
Sit down back there!
Why don't you pick on someone your own size?
Like Bigfoot.
Maybe I will.
Get back in your seats... or I’ll destroy every one of you!
You're dead meat, Stevenson!
Stevenson! if it's the last thing I do today...
I’m gonna make you eat this shirt.
Fight! Fight!
Listen, Coleman, I’m surprised you haven't eaten it already.
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! it’s the principal!
Cool it, man!
Cool it, guys!
Break it up! Break it up!
What is going on here?
Sir, I was just showing Brian... what he did to my shirt, and he pushed me away.
Come on--
Stevenson, you're new here, aren't you?
Yes, sir.
Well, I think we'd better have a little talk in my office.
You have rules to learn.
Toodles, Bri.
There's enough power in here to light up Yankee Stadium.
-Already out on parole?
-Very funny.
So, what's up, Miss Deveaux?
You really want to know, or are you just asking?
I really want to know.
Disgusting. Your face may corrode the camera.
This is cool.
Don't touch. it’s fragile. it’s a night blooming cactus.
I want to see if artificial sunlight... changes its normal blooming pattern.
I’m training it to bloom in the daytime.
To be scientific, I document the results with Polaroids.
Hey, you know what? if you mounted the camera in one spot, like, upside-down... you could take a whole bunch of pictures... and make them into, you know, like a movie.
Here, look.
Like time-lapse photography.
That's great.
Yeah, so I guess it's all set.
Me and you will team up on the project.
Forget it, Brian.
I’ll end up doing all the work.
No chance. Find somebody else to leech off of.
Hey, all right. You know what?
Think about it. Take your time.
You'll probably change your mind.
Hey, if you say there's no monster... then switch rooms with me.
What?
Switch rooms with me.
Yeah. You sleep in Eric's room, and he sleeps in your room.
You just want my room.
I want you to prove me wrong.
I dare you to switch rooms.
-Double dare him.
-Relax, Toad.
I double dare you to switch rooms.
-Will you guys take a hike?
-I’ll pay you.
Hey, Toad.
Brian, you gotta stay the whole night... and you gotta sleep with your legs... sticking out of the covers.
And you have to have the door closed.
Oh, God, please, stop.
I can't take it.
You're frightening me.
Eric, Todd, it's time for bed.
Hey, you guys, don't touch anything in my room.
Good night, Dad.
Good night, Mr. Stevenson.
Good night.
Hey, Dad.
Hey, Bri.
You know, I think it's really nice of you... to switch rooms with Eric like this.
I’m proud of you.
-Thanks.
-Yeah.
Personally, I think you guys are both kind of nuts... about this monster thing... but if you happen to see him tonight...
Yeah?
Could you maybe get me some autographs?
OK. Yes. OK,
I’ll get you autographs!
So the girl's waiting for her roommate to get back.
She's getting real scared.
Oh, yeah. The room is on the second floor.
So she's waiting. it’s probably the darkest night ever.
Suddenly from outside, she hears, ''Thump, thump.
''Thump, thump.''
So she gets real brave.
She inches her way to the door, and she hears it again...
''Thump, thump. Thump, thump.''
So this girl is standing by the door... and the ''Thump, thump'' is getting louder and louder.
So she opens the door, screams... but nothing will come out.
She looks out terrified as her roommate comes up the stairs-- only the ax man cut off all her arms and legs.
She's dragging herself up by her chin.
''Thump, thump. Thump, thump.
Thump, thump.''
Phenomenally incredible, huh? it really happened?
I’m deadly serious, man.
My brother Freddie told me it happened... to a friend of a friend... of a distant cousin of a cousin of ours.
Hey, Brian.
Hey, Brian, you OK?
Looks like you got two weird phenomenons in your house-- a monster and a giant chicken.
Double or nothing.
May I be excused?
Yes.
Eric wanted you to have this.
Hi, Mom.
Hi.
Brian, are you all right?
Fine, Mom. Never felt better.
Well, then what are you doing in bed at 9:15 at night?
School, Mom. it’s a big day ahead of me.
Big, big day.
Sounds nice, Brian, but why don't I believe you? it’s the new me.
OK. Well, I guess
I’ll see the brand new... all new you in the morning.
Mom?
I love you.
I love you, too, honey.
-Good night.
-Good night.
Yeah.
Dad! A monster.
What are you doing, Brian?
What the hell is going-- look at this mess.
What the hell am I stepping in?
Doritos? Jesus.
I’ll clean them up.
You're damn right, you will.
Get back in that bed, mister.
Dad, wait a minute.
There was a monster here.
You gotta believe me.
A monster?
Brian, it's a pile of clothes.
You're wrestling a pile of clothes.
What's so funny?
After you finish cleaning this room tomorrow... you're gonna clean out the garage.
And after the garage, you're gonna cut the hedges.
But it wasn't my fault.
After the hedges, you're gonna mow the lawn.
-it wasn't my fault.
-Good night.
Boo.
Keep an eye out for monsters.
I’ll scream.
Scream? Good idea.
You know what?
You scream, your dad's gonna come in here... with a 1 2-gauge shotgun, blow your head off.
Actually, I’ll scream.
Shut up!
Great.
Actually, your dad's gonna come in here... and find Dorito puke all over the floor.
What's he gonna say?
Wow! Baseball cards.
I love baseball cards.
Got him, got him, need him, got him.
Got him, got him, need him, got him.
A football.
He goes down the 25-yard line... the 50-yard line, the 40-yard line.
Stevenson, go for the long bomb!
Light! The sun!
Let me go, let me go!
OK. Horns.
Great. Great.
Now nobody's gonna recognize me.
I got to get under the bed.
I got to go.
No!
What's happening?
I got to get back.
I got to go.
I got to go.
I got--
What's going on?
Bacon and eggs, kid.
What do you want... sunny side up or over easy?
You're dying. it’s the sunlight, isn't it?
First it disfigures you, then it kills you.
Nah. You're mixing me up with that pansy with the red cape.
Please...
I have to get under the bed... before the sun totally rises.
No way. You wrecked my bike.
You've been pulling stuff, trying to get me in trouble.
Brian...
Brian, please.
Damn.
Hey, bud, the name's Maurice, and I’ll catch you later!
This is ridiculous.
I want my remote.
Where the hell is it?
How am I supposed to watch TV without the remote?
Have you by any chance seen a piece of sandpaper... or a paintbrush around here the last few days?
Yeah, sure, there was one.
But there are no more, right?
Right. Your room is monster-free... so I’ll be taking my master suite back tonight.
Brian! Eric!
Hey, Bri, Eric, have you guys seen the remote thing?
I got the Celtics, the Sox, the Masters are on.
I can't switch it without the remote.
I didn't take it, Dad.
Well, then where--
God damn this house.
Mom, a monster!
Hey, why did you change rooms with that wiffle ball?
He's gonna have a heart attack by the time he's ten.
I get it.
All right, so, like... when it gets darker, your eyeballs get bigger... but then when the lights go on, you turn into clothes.
Brilliant, Bri, just brilliant.
You must be in, what, at least grade two.
Six.
A worldly scholar.
Super. I love it.
How about lighting a candle?
These lights are painful, man.
No way.
I have enough problems... without you running around getting me into more.
You got your stupid remote control back.
Now turn off the lights.
Hey, what about the batteries?
I ate them for breakfast.
I’d give 'em to you right now... but double ''A'' batteries constipate me, OK?
Maybe a little later.
That's gross.
Hey, and what about my bike?
I’ll get you a new bike.
Just get me out of these clothes!
Honest, I’m burning up.
My inseams are on fire!
All right, but any funny moves, and you're clothes.
Grazie, boy, grazie.
You're a pretty sharp kid.
You're ugly, but you're sharp.
Wait. Let me get it.
You know, I thought it was something good, but it's snot.
I’ve been in this business well over 200 years... and I’ve never been trapped once.
-How old are you?
-Eleven.
And I ain't getting any prettier.
Hey, dude. Come here, bud.
You don't know it yet... but tonight is your lucky night.
-What do you mean?
-I mean--
I know, I know. You're gonna grant me three wishes, right?
Wishes? Wishes are bush league leprechaun, pal.
I’m a monster, OK?
Look, listen to this.
I’m a monster, and monsters don't do wishes.
Then what do monsters do?
Good question.
I have the time of my life.
How do you do that? it’s magic, chump. it is.
You just gotta be handsome and gorgeous like me... or have somebody handsome and gorgeous like me show you how.
Brian Stevenson, come on down!
I can't.
Can't? I hate that word.
That word's like caca to me.
No. Can't. Can't.
You can't jam a basketball.
You can't have a hand grenade go off in your lap and survive.
Those things you can't do... but you can take a walk on the wild side.
Well, look. Even if I do go... how do I know
I’m gonna be able to come back?
Listen to me.
What goes on down there is every kid's fantasy. imagine, if you will... imagine a world solely of kids-- kids that just want to have fun.
And make trouble.
Trouble?
Trouble is our code of honor. it’s our blood, our life support system. it’s our raison d'etre.
That's French.
-Do they all look like you?
-Only the good-looking ones.
Think of it, Bri. No teachers, no rules, no homework.
No parents. You hear me, boy?
I said no parents.
Man, that alone is worth all the money in the world. it’s about leaving your clothes wherever you want to leave them. it’s about never having to clean up after you eat. it’s about never worrying about being on time. it’s about staying up late... watching whatever it is you want to watch on TV.
You want to watch Letterman?
The Playboy Channel? it’s about nailing somebody that bugs you... in a way that you never dreamed possible.
What's that? it’s about total,
100%, unadulterated...
''where's the beef'' anarchy!
Brian, it's about freedom.
Freedom to live life... the way the creators of this planet intended.
Man, that sounds great.
What do you say, bud?
You ready?
Maurice, I was born ready.
But first I’m gonna need some insurance.
Whoa, there, thunder.
No, no, no.
Candles, matches, even something festive like this... this would be nice, but absolutely nada.
No bright light, OK, bud?
All right! if you want to take it.
But I’m telling you, you got to hide it, OK?
-Sure. OK.
-Sure. Come on.
Maurice!
Hey, bud.
What is this place?
I thought the dining room was under Eric's room.
Well, we're not in Kansas anymore, buddy.
Come on, take a look at this.
Take a gander, Bri.
Ain't it amazing?
Yo, Brian, move 'em out.
We're burning night light, pard.
Come on, come on, come on.
Hey, Maurice, like the horns.
Sid!
I never forget a face. it’s the other one
I can't remember.
Get out of here, bud.
-Did not!
-Did, too!
-Did not!
-Did, too!
Hey, Al, Grizbit, this is my new bud.
-Hi, Bud.
-Hi. The name's Brian.
Hi, Brian.
-Bud.
-Brian.
-Bud!
-Brian!
-Bud!
-Brian!
Wait a second. What are all these stairs and ladders for?
Good question, bud.
Every one of these staircases... leads to some poor soul's bedroom. it’s like-- let me put this simply. it’s a veritable cornucopia of mischief.
Hi, Maurice.
Hey, come here.
What's that on your shirt?
Where?
Get out of here.
Let me show you around.
Let me show you straight.
Don't do it.
I have to do it.
Don't do it.
Nobody likes you.
Good-bye, cruel world!
Gomer, Brian, Brian, Gomer.
Trick or treat, smell my feet.
You're gonna love this place.
-What?
-All right.
The magic word.
I forget the magic word. it’s--
Think, think, think.
That's it.
Come on, bud.
How you doing?
Rock and roll!
Dance with me, baby.
One, two, cha, cha, cha.
One, two... isn’t this neat, Bri?
Free ball! Free ball!
Hey, what are you doing?
You're going to tilt it.
I know that face.
Kiddo, baby, honey, bubby, open your eyes.
Don't you know down here there's no such thing as tilt?
This is my favorite place on the whole planet.
Every craving you've ever craved... every flavor you've ever flaved.
And the best part is, you don't see any parents... telling the kids what they can't eat, do you?
No.
-Do you?
-No!
Za. I love Za.
Cake.
For later.
Laces tied together.
Hey, somebody wants you over there.
What?
-Hey, who hit me?
-Hey, don't fight.
Look, somebody dropped a quarter.
-Whose is it?
-Don't know.
Here, let me give you a hand with those.
Oh, yeah, me, too. Here.
Hey, Maurice.
-Hey, Schmoog.
-Who's the drip?
Hey, ease off, bud.
This young man, he saved me from a fatal case of sunburn... so I decided to give him the grand tour.
Oh, very well.
-You got a brat in Cleveland...
-A brat in Cleveland.
-an imp in Atlanta...
-An imp in Atlanta.
-And a twerp in Boston.
-And a twerp in--
And a dweeb giving me all this.
Raise hell tonight and show him how it's done.
I will.
Wait a second.
You're not gonna tell me... there's an airport in this place, are you?
Brian. Come on.
Does it look like... these hunchbacks can handle a plane? it’s magic.
That was pretty neat, huh?
You see, down here, distance is like time.
And time is like... it's like polyester with an acrylon blend.
Sorry, bud.
Wait a second.
This is somebody else's house.
No...duh!
Where'd you park the squad car,
Dick Tracy?
Come on.
Hey, chill out, babe, OK?
I mean, you're quick.
That's a good instinct... but it's a little primitive, huh?
Not now, Harold. isn’t he sweet?
I bet you he's dreaming about puppies... and his favorite baseball player.
Yeah. Well, not for long.
-Yellow.
-Yellow.
Yellow.
-Blue.
-Blue.
-Blue.
-Blue.
Chocolate.
Never above 3'6''.
-Always against white.
-Yeah.
You know, Bri, we live in a world... dedicated to wreaking hell on an entire nation of kids.
Hey, they're not that bad.
We're the reason kids get locked in their rooms.
We're the reason brothers hate their sisters.
We're also the reason parents send their kids back to camp.
I love it. I’m alive!
Maurice, is there any way
I can make a special stop?
I want to check somebody out.
You're too good.
You're just too damn good.
Something stinks.
Look at Ronnie Coleman with his little teddy bear.
And his thumb.
This is classic.
What's this?
-Ronnie's sandwich.
-Ronnie's sandwich.
Yeah. All right.
-What flavor?
-What is it?
Tuna fish.
That stinks.
Cat food.
-And then some tuna.
-Perfect!
And then bake it in the oven.
-Wrap it nicely.
-350 degrees.
OK. All right. Ready?
Turn it face up.
No one will ever notice.
What? What?
Apple juice.
-Hold this.
-So what? Yeah?
What?
You're drinking it?
Maurice, that's disgusting.
What is that all about?
And good for you, too.
What are you doing?
All right, Maurice!
That's great!
All right. Yes.
Oh, yeah.
Yes.
Oh, boy, what'd you eat today, man?
-Ronnie is gonna be pissed.
-No kidding.
I feel like I have been on vacation for a week.
Bud.
Oh, no.
My dad's getting up in ten minutes.
That means the sun comes up in five.
OK, bud.
I can't bear to see anybody go up there without protection.
Those UVs can be pretty dangerous...
-if you know what I mean.
-Thanks.
Yeah. Visiting hours are over at dawn... so unless you want a new residence... or a set of horns, we'd better book, bud, OK?
I suppose you're going to tell me your sister did this?
I’m innocent! I’m innocent!
I’ll take a lie detector test! if you didn't do it, who did?!
I don't know!
Peter! it’s because I’m working, isn't it?
Son, doll hair never grows back!
What made you think the cat needed a shave?
Do you want to go to military school?!
Good morning, Mr. Stevenson!
Move it.
Hey, what's with the glasses,
Rip Van Winkle?
I had a late night.
I bet you were up real late working on your science project.
Actually, I never thought of it that way.
Well, mine's all finished.
Great!
Piss! Who put piss in my apple juice?
-Gross!
-Yes!
Yes! All right!
He spit piss on the principal!
Maurice!
A natural!
A no holds barred, dyed in the wool... no assembly required natural.
-What?
-What? What do you think?
Jeez, I thought I was quick, but you, Scooby Doo... you're already moving through the shadows.
No, I’m not.
-No, you're not.
-No.
-No?
-You pulled me through.
Get out of town.
Fine, fine, fine.
Don't believe me... but I’m telling you one thing, buddy boy. it was a lot easier... pulling you through tonight than it was last night.
Maurice, why'd you do that?
Nice ass.
I’m good in twister, too.
Not even my mother sees me in my boxer shorts!
Well, did you ever see her in hers?
Say, Bri... don't you have any cheese in your life, bud?
Cheese? What kind?
-Mademoiselles.
-What?
Squeeze, tomatoes, broads, chicks... girls. I said girls.
Don't you have anybody else in your life besides your mother... who wears an over the shoulder boulder holder?
I think your babe just barked.
So, what's this Kiersten dame like?
Personally,
I’m a wart and mole kind of guy.
Hey, I’m talking to you.
Well, she's pretty neat, but she's a girl.
You know, real smart-- always knows the answer, always raises her hand.
-Always has her homework done?
-Exactly.
I amaze me.
OK, Gumby, Showtime.
I don't believe it.
She likes me.
I thought she hated me.
Why would anybody hate you, Bri?
All you are is ugly.
Hey, Brian...
I want you to meet a couple friends of mine.
This is Barbie, and this is Midge.
These chicks are so close to my heart.
No, no. it’s just that ever since we moved here...
I haven't really been able to make friends, other than you.
And I never thought anybody really cared... least of all Kiersten.
Oh, Brian, everybody cares. it’s just that certain people... have a different way of showing it.
Some people are more giving than other people, right?
There you go, bud.
Enjoy yourself.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I’ll keep this.
Hey, look at her flip book. isn’t this neat?
I can't believe it.
You know, I thought of this.
I gave her the idea.
Man's best friend.
His right hand.
Good boy.
Fine. I won't see you anymore.
I’ll just sleep in the office and send you the check.
I wouldn't notice the difference.
That's all you want from me-- my paycheck.
That's not all I want from you.
That's all I get.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Mr. ''I’ve got a headache.''
We don't even need a door.
Fine, fine.
We won't fight anymore.
Take away the fighting, there's nothing left... of our marriage at all.
Keep your voice down.
The kids can hear.
Brian?
Now you care about the kids.
Brian?
Can I have a flashlight?
Oh, shit! it’s Snik! it’s Snik!
Run, run, run!
Let's get out of here!
Arnie, Arnie, Arnie.
Arnie. You know,
Boy gets what he wants.
When he asks you for a favor... you should take that as a compliment.
But I tried.
You gotta believe me, Snik.
I tried.
Oh, you tried, did you, Arnold?
Well, you didn't try hard enough!
My knees, they hurt!
Oh, your knees hurt?
Well, that's not all that's gonna hurt, Arnold.
You know why? Because
I’m gonna take my big thumb... and jam it in your eye!
Then I’m gonna take my finger... and put it in the corner of your mouth... and I’m gonna rip the corner of your mouth out!
That's good for a laugh, isn't it?
You're scared of me, aren't you, Arnold?
I like that.
I love that.
But you know what I like even more than that, Arnold?
I like taking my two big black leather gloved hands... and grabbing your head and tearing it off!
Boy gets what he wants!
Hey, remember,
Boy always gets what he wants.
Never ever, ever forget that!
Ever!
Well, you didn't have to mess up her room.
Bud, if there's one rule... it's you never ever, ever, ever... get emotionally involved with the victim--ever.
Maurice, she was starting to like me.
I can't wait to see her tomorrow.
Let me show you this, bud.
You're gonna love this.
-Yeah.
-This is great.
Look, look.
How do you play this?
Come here. it’s simple.
Let me show you, bud.
All right, we get the shit.
We smash the shit.
And then we put the shit back. it’s called monster ball.
We do the bashing.
You get the thrashing.
Let's play ball. Come on, bud.
Oh, my god!
No, no!
Hang on!
He's a new kid.
He's with me, Snik.
Maurice! No one should ever, ever... come this close to Boy's stairway!
Right. Never ever, ever come this close to Boy's stairway!
Hey, kid, you want a fresh fly?
No, no!
I could break his neck, Maurice.
-I could.
-Let's drop him.
No! He's just kidding.
Snik, think of this.
Dead people have limited potential... and I don't think that Boy would like damaged goods.
But it's your responsibility, and you--
Oh, no, he's your responsibility, Maurice.
Oh, no, he's your responsibility, Maurice.
Right. Right. if you screw up, I drop you!
That's fair. Let's go, bud.
Oh, my back.
Run. Go, go, go.
Damn it, Maurice, who was that?
-Who, Snik?
-Yeah.
All talk. Just a big mouth.
And ever since he developed that hump... he's been such a bitch.
But you learn to stay away from Snik... and his staircase, OK, bud?
No kidding.
Let's move it.
You're such a doll.
Come on.
-But he wasn't there.
-Was the window open?
I don't know. I didn't check.
Maybe he went outside.
Maybe he stepped outside to smoke a cigarette.
I bet that's it.
At 4:00 in the morning?
And I just--yes.
That was very--
You brought that up great, and--
Well, Mr. Stevenson... thank you for joining us.
Please come in.
You're just in time for Kiersten's presentation.
Kiersten, are you ready?
-Yes, I am, Mr. Finn.
-Oh, look at this.
-That's wonderful.
-Thank you.
Do you have your research report?
-Yes.
-OK.
I thought I did.
Maurice.
I guess my dog chewed it up.
Oh, right.
You don't even have a dog.
All right, that's enough.
Hey, Bri, nothing to worry about.
Only a drill.
Hey, pard, what's with the lights?
-Something personal?
-Yeah, you.
Me? Your only friend in the whole world?
Window pain.
My used-to-be only friend in the whole wide world.
You messed up
Kiersten's homework.
What? What did I do to the homework?
You chewed it up.
You destroyed it.
You know she got a Zero because of you?
Brian, I was hungry, OK?
And it just so happened at that moment...
I had a craving for a six-page paper... on the daytime blooming of a nighttime cactus.
And I’ll tell you something else.
I got incredible heartburn from that.
I can't believe you did that.
I asked you not to... and you just went ahead and did it anyway.
Brian, I happen to have a...
You like her, don't you?
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.
-No, I don't.
-Yes, you do.
No, I don't.
Brian's got a girlfriend.
Brian's got a girlfriend.
No, I don't!
Brian's got a girlfriend.
Would it help the boo boo if I said I was sorry?
Here, look, just go back to your dumb underworld... and leave me and Eric alone.
Dad, what is it?
Hey, Brian, come downstairs with me.
Your mom and I want to talk to you and Eric for a minute.
Do you want a ride?
Sure, Daddy.
We wanted to talk to the both of you, because... well, your mother and l have come to a decision... and it affects all of us.
We feel you're grown up enough to understand.
We feel you're grown up enough to understand.
Mom and I have decided... that we're not gonna live together for a while.
A business trip?
No, honey, not exactly.
Eric, don't you get it?
They're getting a divorce.
No, Brian, we are not getting a divorce.
Yeah, right. it’s just that your father and l need to work some things out... and we feel it would be better if we were--
Look, it's just like a-- it's a trial separation.
God, sorry. That's what you do before you get a divorce.
Brian, we're not getting a divorce.
So Dad's not leaving?
-Eric...
-Good.
Listen to me. I have to live in the city for a while.
Hopefully, it won't be for long.
No. You don't have to go.
Yes, I do.
Yes, I do.
But, look, we'll get to talk every day.
I’ll be good, I promise.
I’ll be better.
You won't have to go and live in the city.
I swear to God, I’ll be better.
Brian, too. He promises. Right?
Eric, it's not your fault, and it's not Brian's fault. it isn't anybody's fault. it isn't anybody's fault.
Bri, you all right?
Yeah, Dad, I’m just fine.
I heard it all.
Sucks, huh?
Yeah. it’s not too good.
I hate them.
No, you don't.
No, you don't.
At least you have a family.
Believe it or not... you're the only real friend I have.
Why do you think
I keep coming back? if I didn't like you,
I’d have your parents... blaming you for the shooting of Abe Lincoln.
Come on down. it’ll cheer you up. Come on.
I don't really feel like being cheery.
Oh, Bri, baby... pranks, snacks, games. it’ll take away the hurt.
Come on.
Know what we could do?
Go see Kiersten.
We'll bring her flowers.
I’ve got a great idea.
We'll go to Ronnie Coleman's... and we'll loosen all the bolts on his furniture.
What do you say? it’ll be quick. it’s good for your bones.
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Come on.
OK.
All right! Come on.
Alley oop!
-You all right, bud?
-Yeah, fine.
Hey, where's the party?
Night light out at the Grossberg's.
Coming through. New guy.
Coming through. Excuse me.
Move over. Come on, bud. is this the line with tickets?
Come on, bub. New guy.
We're here.
Bri, I’d like you to meet some of my friends.
This is Sherry, Debbie,
Pumpkin, Bernie.
This is great.
Well, let's do it, man.
This is fun.
Scare the hell out of her, Bri.
Go ahead, Tonto.
Make her poop her Pampers.
Make her doody her diapers.
Make her caca her crib.
Watch this. He's great.
Go ahead, bud.
Maurice, she's just a little baby.
Baby, baby, baby. it’s our duty, man.
This is a character builder.
Come on, Tonto.
Scare the hell out of her.
Watch this, guys.
Watch this.
Go ahead.
Scare the hell out of her.
-Boo.
-Boo?
-Boo.
-Boo?
What are you, the tooth fairy?
Stop it.
Come on, stop it!
Brian, relax, OK?
Maurice, this is cruel.
Baby!
-Light!
-Brian!
Todd, are you OK?
What happened?
Brian!
I’m shrinking.
Something's wrong.
So, how are the kids taking it?
They're fine.
Eric went to school.
Brian stayed home.
He's upstairs... sawing the legs off all the beds.
OK, so I guess each kid just has his own way of dealing with it.
Beats being an axe murderer in ten years.
Yeah.
Just give me a second.
I can--
We almost had him.
He was becoming one of us.
He knows our secrets, Maurice.
I’ll tell you. You know what?
Let's leave him alone.
We'll just leave him alone, and--
You just don't get it,
Maurice.
Sometimes Boy gets a little lonely.
He wanted to play with him.
Why doesn't he just play with himself?
Why doesn't Boy play with himself?
Yeah.
Come here.
No. Don't get me upset, Snik.
You know what happens when I get upset.
That's it. I’m upset.
What the hell is that?
I don't know. That's what happens when I get upset.
You know something?
What? No.
I don't like you, Maurice.
You're always trying to be so funny.
Well, I got a little riddle for you.
OK.
What happens when boy doesn't get what he wants?
I don't know.
I have a hunch.
Hunch? is that my hunch you're talking about, Maurice?
Oh, no, no. I take it back.
-I take it--
-Back?
-No.
-Hunchback?
You bring a kid in here?
You tell him our secrets?
My horn! if you can't get him,
I will.
Mom!
Brian! Wake up, wake up!
Eric's gone.
Have you seen him?
-Do you know where he went?
-Gone? He's gone?!
Look, Brian, if you know anything, tell me right now.
He's not in his room?
No. Do you think he went to see Daddy?
-He wouldn't do that, would he?
-No.
Todd's house.
Maybe he's there.
Come on, Toad. Be awake.
All right.
Go away!
Toad, come on. I need you... and every spare flashlight you have in the house--now.
Leave me alone, Brian.
You're one of them.
Todd, listen to me.
They have Eric.
Who has Eric?
The monsters.
They kidnapped him.
Kidnapped him?
Which monsters?
The little monsters.
Hi, Kiersten.
Brian, what's wrong?
I know you're not gonna believe it... but I need some help on my science project.
-is this some sort of prank?
-No, I’m serious.
I need your key to get into the supply room. it’s an emergency.
I need some lights.
Do you expect me to believe that? it defies every rule known to the scientific mind.
So you don't believe me?
Well, watch this.
Holy shit!
Amazing!
I hope this works.
Oh, man, that'll get 'em.
That's like a howitzer or something.
You must know a lot about electricity to do that.
How come you get Fs in science?
Let's go.
Yeah.
What are you doing?
I’m setting my alarm for sunrise.
What the heck for?
All right, when this goes off, we have three to five minutes. if we're not out before the sun clears the horizon... we'll turn into monsters.
-Monsters.
-Monsters?
You mean there's a chance we might not make it?
Yeah, of course there's a chance.
I know where Eric is, but I’m not leaving until I have him.
Are you still in?
You don't have to.
I’m in. Eric's my best friend.
Come on, let's go.
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?
You're not leaving without me. in the name of science,
I’m going.
OK. Let's do it.
You can't get through without me.
Hold on. Ready?
I’m ready. it’s a parallel dimension.
Give me that!
My knapsack!
Lights!
-Lights!
-Lights!
-Lights!
-Lights!
This way.
That's the master staircase. it goes up to Boy's room.
Who's Boy?
The guy who runs this place.
Stick with me. I know the way.
Careful. it’s a long way down.
Brian Stevenson.
The real boy wonder.
What a pleasure it is... to finally make your acquaintance.
Where's Eric?
And you brought some little playmates along with you.
How nice. Are they as tactful and fleet-footed as yourself?
I daresay they don't look it.
I want my brother!
Now, Brian, what sort of a greeting is that?
After all, we are so much alike. if you stay, you will be the one in charge of yourself.
Perhaps this whole world, in time.
You'll be the one with the power, the authority.
Not your parents, not your teachers-- you.
Now, Brian, isn't that what you want?
I want Eric-- now!
Brian.
Why such cruelty?
You're a very unique individual, Brian.
Your feats are unprecedented here.
Why, I can scarcely remember the last time... one of our little breed had been trapped.
Not once, but numerous times.
Enough wind, loafer breath!
Hand over the kid!
Where is he? Let's see him!
Very well.
Let's have the contestants take a look... behind curtain number one.
Brian?
Brian.
Let's make a deal. it’s your wits and grace that I desire... not those of your pugnacious chum... or even your silly, mute little girlfriend.
I’ll let them all go... and your brother... if you'll stay... and be my pal.
No deals.
Very well.
Eric!
Let him go now!
I’ll give you ten seconds!
Ten, nine, eight...
Be sensible, Brian.
Why lose five lives when you can gain four? in an hour, you and your chums... will all be monsters, and then we can all play. seven, six...
Brian? five, four...
Let's blow him away, Brian!
Three! Let Eric go!
Two, one!
Hi! Are you looking for your brother?
Well, we've got him!
No!
I hoped we could be friends, Brian... but evidently, you don't play fair.
Boy, I haven't even begun to play!
Let go!
Snik, show Brian to his room.
Bye-bye, Brian!
Brian. it’s you.
Todd, is Eric here?
Nope.
Kiersten.
Maurice! What happened?
What happened?
Two inches lower and this bonehead... would be talkin' to my lawyer, buddy boy.
You know him? He's a monster.
Yeah, Todd, Kiersten, this is Maurice.
A monster?
I have an idea.
We can generate light... by wiring pencils to the phone.
Yo, babe. Light from pencils?
And I’m the pope.
Just like a carbon lamp from a projector.
Done.
Todd, you crank.
Brian, you hold the pencils... and I’ll slide the dirty laundry under the door.
Good idea.
Faster, Todd.
-Go, Toad, go!
-Faster.
Go, Toad, go!
-Faster!
-I’m trying!
-if at first...
-Come on! you don't succeed, try, try... a light!
OK, now open the door.
OK, Maurice, let us out.
Any of you freaks know how to pick a combination lock?
Just jokin'!
What are you doin' lyin' around?
We got work to do, bud.
Where are you going?
To get some more firepower.
Oh...you see...
Let's go.
All right, let's do it.
-Come on.
-Keep it going. Come on.
Oh, Ronnie?
We'll need the sun lamps.
Oh, this is good.
Here we go!
Say good night, Boy!
Oh, shit!
The beeps!
We gotta get outta here!
Eric's here somewhere.
I know it.
Come on!
Wait till
I get my hands on you.
I’m gonna kick your butt with this boot.
I gotta get it together.
I gotta get myself together!
Kiersten, take the curtain.
You guys take the box.
-I got it.
-Right.
Nope. Nothing in there.
Brian.
Brian...Brian.
Help us with this one, boys. it’s not budging.
-Look, a crank, a crank.
-it won't budge.
Eric!
Eric!
All right, man!
Come on, let's get outta here!
Let's get outta here!
Oh, shit!
How much time?
Maybe a minute.
Great. Coleman, you think you could take him?
No way!
Looks like there's no way out!
Who is that guy?
Hey, Snik.
How about a light, bud?
Come on, let's go home!
Don't step on me!
Ding dong, the Snik is dead! Yeah!
Brian. Brian.
Wait.
Let's go.
Sit down.
What?
Brian... sit down. it’s too late.
What's that supposed to mean? it means we've dissected our last frog.
We're stuck.
We're monsters.
Well, I can handle that.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, I can't.
Come on. Follow me.
Well, where you goin', bud?
-West!
-Hey, Brian, wait up.
Yeah, right.
Hey, Brian, wait up!
Come on, hurry!
The sun's up in St. Louis, bud.
Oh, man!
Phoenix! Phoenix!
-Where's Phoenix?
-Phoenix? That-a-way.
That-a-way. Come on, kids.
Hey, bud.
Bet the sun's up, huh?
I gotta quit smoking.
Try California!
All right!
Come on!
You're goin' home!
All right!
Here we go. Goin' home.
-Goin' up!
-Yeah!
We're goin' home.
You're goin' home.
Come on.
We're goin' home, guys.
-Come on.
-Radical, man.
Come on, yeah!
Come on, Ronnie.
Oh, pardon me, sir.
Well... you're next.
Kinda wish I could stay.
You'd be a hero down here.
Maurice, my arm--
I mean, it turned to clothes last night.
Don't worry about that.
You'll sleep that off.
Nothing's permanent... unless you get trapped down here, bud.
But I suppose you gotta get up there...
'cause you're gonna get married pretty soon.
Married? To who?
To light bulb. Red.
Oh, Kiersten? No.
Just friends.
Friends.
Yeah.
Well...
I guess that's what it's all about, huh?
Yeah. I guess.
You know what?
You're the best friend
I’ve ever had.
You're the ugliest friend
I ever had.
Time to move on, bud.
I’m gonna miss you, Maurice.
I really am.
Let's go, Brian.
The sun's coming up.
There's no way
I’m running to Hawaii.
Hang on.
Hang on.
Oh, no. Maurice--
Oh, just relax.
I can get another one.
How else are you gonna remember me anyway?
Come on, Brian, let's go.
Bye, Maurice.
Remember--where there's a bed, there's a way.
Come on, let's go!
Come on, Brian!
Brian!
Let's go.
Come on!
-Hello?
-Mom! I’ve got Eric!
-it’s Brian!
-it’s Brian!
-He's found Eric!
-Are they all right?
-Are you all right?
-Yeah, we're fine.
-They're all right.
-Thank God. Tell him I’m here.
Look, Dad's here.
Stay where you are.
He'll come pick you up.
-Where are they?
-Where are you?
Malibu.
-They're in Malibu.
-Malibu?
-Massachusetts?
-Where the hell's that?
-Where the hell is that?
-California.
California.
California?
How the hell did they get there?
What on earth are you doing there? it’s kind of a long story.
{2313}{2367}Unus in nihil...
{2601}{2671}Omnia in duos...
{2706}{2781}Duo in unum...
{2807}{2875}Unum in nihil.
{3259}{3310}Nec quattuor...
{3331}{3448}nec omnia, nec unus, nec nihil sunt.
{5010}{5067}- Is this...?|- Yes, this is Cragganmore.
{5072}{5175}Yes, this is the house of Ulrich.|And no, he won't see you.
{5180}{5265}- But...|- I know. Your business is urgent.
{5270}{5321}It doesn't matter. He sees no one.
{5326}{5420}- Please...|- Please yourself. Go home.
{5493}{5565}Well, what do we do now, boy?
{5584}{5661}You who knows so much,|answer me that.
{5785}{5869}Hear me,|you who dwell in Cragganmore.
{5874}{5981}Ulrich, we will stay here|until we are heard.
{6241}{6290}Magister?
{6678}{6742}- What is it?|- We have visitors.
{6790}{6839}I know.
{6844}{6918}- I will see them.|- You will?
{6923}{6972}Yes.
{6977}{7054}There's a great task|needing to be done.
{7085}{7219}I have been witness to something -|something of consequence to you.
{7247}{7352}- To me?|- Yes. My own death.
{7458}{7520}I knew it. Thieves.
{7932}{8013}Looks forbidding enough,|don't you think?
{8018}{8062}Oh, yes.
{8067}{8121}Master?
{8126}{8248}No. They'd think me infirm.
{8268}{8353}Balisarius wore this before he died.
{8400}{8516}You know, I actually|saw him change lead into gold.
{8564}{8651}I could never do that.|Mmm... Too bad.
{8656}{8716}You'd have stood|to inherit some real wealth.
{8721}{8803}Magister, please,|don't talk like that.
{8808}{8911}- You're not going to die.|- Oh, I look forward to it.
{8915}{9009}All this magic,|what has it accomplished?
{9046}{9114}Tell me, how are your studies going?
{9134}{9212}Fine. They're going well.
{9217}{9283}You still wish to be a sorcerer?
{9288}{9418}- Oh, yes. More than anything.|- Well, then, adeptus minor,
{9422}{9521}get yourself a handful|of that sulphurous ash over there.
{10324}{10411}Nunc habeamus lucem...
{10519}{10571}...et calorem.
{10836}{10927}Welcome to Cragganmore. I am Ulrich.
{10932}{10998}Which of you men|calls himself Valerian?
{11087}{11170}- We are here on behalf...|- I know why you're here.
{11175}{11305}You're a delegation from Urland,|which is beyond Dalvatia.
{11337}{11386}Let's see the artefacts.
{11723}{11771}Scales.
{11776}{11845}- How did you come by these?|- I found them
{11850}{11926}at the mouth of the lair.
{11931}{11980}What else?
{12098}{12175}- A claw.|- That's no claw, by the gods.
{12206}{12303}It's a tooth!|You want me to do battle with that?!
{12348}{12455}- Who else can we turn to?|- Did you try the Meredydd Sisters?
{12460}{12557}What about Rinbod?|I heard tell he killed a dragon once.
{12562}{12644}They're all dead.|You're the only one left.
{12680}{12752}It's a long way to Urland.
{12820}{12910}Twice each year,|at the spring and autumn equinox,
{12915}{13008}the King selects|a new victim - virgins.
{13013}{13092}A lottery. Barbaric.
{13097}{13156}And in return, this dragon,
{13161}{13243}it leaves your villages|and crops unburned.
{13284}{13375}Your king|has made a pact with a monster.
{13380}{13448}- Master, don't you think...?|- Silence.
{13451}{13496}Are you afraid of dragons?
{13560}{13597}No.
{13601}{13700}In fact, if it weren't for sorcerers,|there wouldn't be any dragons.
{13705}{13775}Once the skies were dotted with them.
{13779}{13847}Magnificent horned backs,|leather wings,
{13852}{13951}soaring in their hot-breath wind.
{13955}{14031}I know this creature of yours...
{14054}{14125}Vermithrax Pejorative.
{14150}{14223}Look at these scales, these ridges.
{14234}{14355}When a dragon gets this old,|it knows only pain, constant pain.
{14379}{14467}It grows decrepit, crippled...
{14472}{14552}pitiful... spiteful.
{14592}{14636}Will you help us?
{14680}{14741}Here. Good.
{14746}{14796}Now let me go.
{14842}{14886}No...
{14891}{14983}No, not a bit too heavy.
{14988}{15100}I'll conquer the highest mountain.|What say you, Galen?
{15168}{15232}Speak up, boy. Hodge?
{15237}{15294}Er... If you say so, sir.
{15360}{15453}When I've gone,|see you keep your nose in your books
{15458}{15524}and your hands out of my reagents.
{15529}{15636}How far can you get? A league? Two?
{15641}{15707}I'm not worried about the road.
{15818}{15857}Tyrian.
{15896}{15955}Good morrow.
{16023}{16072}What do you want?
{16077}{16141}Young Master Valerian,
{16146}{16224}The question is,|what do you want so far from home?
{16239}{16297}We're not afraid of you.|Give us the road.
{16303}{16409}Why, the road is yours,|all the way to Urland.
{16414}{16469}It's a long journey, isn't it?
{16474}{16556}But when you're|in search of a sorcerer,
{16561}{16620}I suppose no distance is too great.
{16625}{16746}- Say nothing.|- Here's the mystical one himself.
{16751}{16852}You'd best keep your distance...|and your manners.
{16857}{16971}If he's ready to slay a dragon,|he's nothing to fear from me.
{17002}{17110}I've no more love for that creature|than you lot, nor has the King,
{17115}{17201}but before you stir things up,
{17206}{17330}don't you think you should find out|if he's the right man for the job?
{17336}{17456}Ah! So it's a test you're|looking for? We don't do tests.
{17463}{17527}Oh, I'm sure you don't.
{17592}{17669}They never do tests.|Nor many real deeds.
{17696}{17772}Oh, conversation with your|grandmother's shade in a dark room,
{17777}{17845}the odd love potion,|but comes a doubter -
{17849}{17930}why, then it's the wrong day,|the planets aren't in line,
{17935}{18003}the entrails aren't favourable,|"We don't do tests".
{18008}{18072}We've got no doubts.|We require no tests.
{18077}{18151}- And you're not going to get one.|- Enough!
{18156}{18237}Here. Put this in the conjuring room.
{18242}{18358}Go to the iron box.|Bring me the dagger within.
{18363}{18412}The dagger. Be quick.
{18499}{18565}You shall have your test.
{18899}{18986}Where are you, boy? I'm waiting.
{19029}{19138}- It's not this one, is it?|- The very one. Let it fall.
{19989}{20078}Mortem confundit magus.
{20580}{20685}- No! Stop him!|- Go on. Don't worry.
{20690}{20752}You can't hurt me.
{24587}{24711}Magical powers indeed.|Look at you now - magical ashes.
{27002}{27037}Hodge!
{27084}{27123}Hodge!
{27826}{27914}The kindest lord|a man could ever wish for.
{27919}{27973}Now he's gone.
{27978}{28108}Ye gods! You'd think he could boil|his own eggs at the snap of a finger,
{28112}{28192}but no, he had old Hodge to do it.
{28197}{28340}Up at five every morning, clearing|out the cages, emptying the slops.
{28345}{28415}Never a thank you|or a pat on the back.
{28421}{28477}I shall miss him.
{28482}{28543}- I do already.|- Oh, no, you don't.
{28548}{28642}All you think about|is your tricks and your knavery,
{28647}{28741}but you don't pull any wool|over these old eyes.
{28746}{28878}You'll have to walk far before|you fill his shoes, mark my words.
{28884}{28966}What's the matter, Hodge?|Pack too heavy?
{29081}{29184}No! Don't! Stop that! I need that!
{29192}{29272}Oh, give it back to me! This way!
{29282}{29331}I think you're too warm.
{29390}{29456}Stop it!|Out of respect for the master!
{29484}{29576}I have as much respect|for the master as anyone, old man,
{29581}{29632}but I'm master now.
{29780}{29856}I left my farm and for what?
{29862}{29933}For a cremation, that's what.
{29939}{30042}All because|someone said find a magician -
{30067}{30177}not a local fellow, an import,|some 100 leagues from home -
{30210}{30274}an all-powerful necromancer.
{30279}{30374}Huh! That's some necromancer.
{30379}{30445}Hold your tongue, Griel. Eat.
{30450}{30499}I'll not eat. I'm not hungry.
{30569}{30660}He's right.|I brought us here for nothing.
{30858}{30927}What is it? Who's there?
{30998}{31047}Salvete, viatores!
{31052}{31125}Good morrow.|Good morrow. Peace be with you.
{31131}{31180}What do you want?
{31208}{31274}My lord Ulrich is no longer.
{31278}{31385}All that you asked of him,|you may now expect of me.
{31390}{31499}The dangers he would face,|I will now conquer.
{31504}{31607}The task he would undertake,|I will now fulfil.
{31647}{31769}I am Galen Bradwardyn, inheritor|of Ulrich's craft and knowledge...
{31821}{31885}and I am the sorcerer you seek.
{32646}{32714}Close enough. Bring her out.
{33245}{33335}Now be it known throughout|the kingdom that this maiden,
{33340}{33431}having lawfully been chosen|by a deed of fortune and destiny,
{33437}{33542}shall hereby give up her life|for the greater good of Urland...
{33616}{33736}By this act shall be satisfied|the powers that dwell underground
{33742}{33827}and the spirits that attend thereto.
{33833}{33890}In gratitude for this sacrifice,
{33895}{34007}His Majesty declares the family|Plowman to be free of obligations
{34012}{34086}for a period|not to exceed five years.
{34191}{34226}Duly ordained!
{38789}{38842}What have you got there, Hodge?
{38847}{38908}- None of your business.|- Gold, eh?
{38913}{39015}- Shall I change it into lead?|- Save your jokes for someone else.
{39020}{39113}I do not care|for braggarts... or frauds.
{39141}{39211}- I'm no fraud.|- Fool, then.
{39215}{39285}Upstart. Whatever pleases you.
{39291}{39369}Look, Hodge,|nobody forced you to come along.
{39374}{39433}I came of my own|free will, all right.
{39438}{39507}We each do the Master's bidding|in our own way.
{39876}{39952}What are you doing? Don't come in!
{40002}{40099}- How's the water?|- It's cold.
{40229}{40311}I prefer to swim alone|if you don't mind.
{40498}{40547}Stay away!
{40703}{40757}- Look. Isn't that the...?|- Yes.
{40763}{40837}- The retainer from Cragganmore.|- Why is he here?
{40842}{40953}- Filling in for his chief.|- You going to allow that, sir?
{41054}{41111}Bring me my bow.
{41198}{41273}No, I'm not going to say anything.
{41278}{41406}I don't blame you.|I was careless. A silly woman.
{41410}{41526}Oh, I... I knew the moment I saw you.|I've known the whole time.
{41531}{41580}You never knew a thing.
{41585}{41680}No one's known, not since I was born.
{41717}{41775}The lottery.
{41780}{41857}- Daughters are chosen, sons are not.|- That's right.
{41862}{41961}- Unless you're the King's daughter.|- What do you mean?
{41993}{42077}If you're rich enough,|your name never goes in.
{42082}{42137}My father is poor.
{42167}{42229}So are a lot of fathers.
{43626}{43659}No!
{43696}{43731}No!
{43788}{43840}No!
{43879}{43914}Hodge!
{43935}{43979}Hodge!
{44059}{44104}Hodge.
{44240}{44352}- Galen, can you hear me?|- I hear you.
{44357}{44482}Do you know, somebody shot me,|but I can still talk.
{44487}{44539}There's something|that needs to be done.
{44544}{44627}- I know.|- No, no. Not the dragon.
{44632}{44706}The master's ashes. Here.
{44735}{44817}I'm sorry.|You'll have to peel it loose.
{44886}{44955}- Burning water!|- What?
{44960}{45038}Find the lake. Throw it in.
{45064}{45122}Hodge, what are you doing with this?
{45127}{45186}Burning... water.
{45239}{45293}Hodge, don't die.
{45311}{45385}Listen to me.|You're not going to die.
{47262}{47297}Urland.
{49110}{49161}Come on. Don't slow down here.
{49166}{49284}- Is the whole kingdom like this?|- No. We're near the lair.
{49289}{49350}The lair? Where is it?
{49355}{49454}- It doesn't matter.|- Show me. Where?
{49489}{49569}We're in no danger|if we just pass through quickly.
{49574}{49625}I want to see it.
{49659}{49703}Griel.
{49867}{49922}Malkin! Malkin!
{50682}{50783}- Are there other entrances?|- No. One's enough.
{50969}{51023}Don't be a fool! You'll provoke it!
{51070}{51139}How do you know it's in there?
{51263}{51335}Go on, then.|Get yourself burned alive.
{51341}{51411}What a fine trick that will be.
{52657}{52710}Vermithrax?
{53424}{53483}Tu saxum saxorum
{53488}{53554}in adversum montem operam da!
{53567}{53687}Inatibulum inquinatum draconis!
{54813}{54854}No! Consistete!
{55018}{55074}Redite... No!
{55195}{55238}Ascedete!
{56338}{56379}He's done it!
{58036}{58085}Put that away!
{58154}{58203}What if you were seen?
{59621}{59670}Musicians?
{60806}{60885}She was twice the man|of anyone in the village.
{60890}{60948}Now she's twice the woman.
{60953}{61027}Would that I was|as clever as her father.
{61089}{61168}Come, Griel.|Don't begrudge a life spared.
{61174}{61238}No, I... I begrudge nothing.
{61278}{61390}But I wonder at what we have seen...|and how it was done.
{61396}{61480}- You were there.|- Aye. And isn't it strange
{61485}{61568}that the very moment|that the beast was put down,
{61573}{61632}there should be a holy man|in the village?
{61637}{61686}Now, isn't that strange?
{61885}{61944}Could the Christian god|bring down a mountain?
{61949}{62021}- Is it possible, Father?|- Of course. Why not?
{62874}{63009}A celebration!|Well, don't stop on my account.
{63069}{63152}Musicians, more music.
{63248}{63336}A toast... to the deed of the day.
{63406}{63455}What would you have of us?
{63479}{63547}With you? Not a thing.
{63564}{63613}It's this one.
{63716}{63784}The King would meet|our new-found benefactor,
{63789}{63886}and offer his gratitude|to the one man who has succeeded
{63890}{63944}where so many have failed.
{63995}{64054}What sort of gratitude?
{64059}{64129}A knife in the belly?|An arrow in the chest?
{64156}{64284}My young friend, I would as soon|dispatch you as I did the rest,
{64304}{64359}and for the same reason,
{64365}{64483}but His Majesty would have a cosy|little chat and commands otherwise.
{64765}{64829}Behold. Eggs fit for a king.
{64909}{64957}All right...
{64960}{65038}How many of you|have ever seen a table fly?
{65043}{65145}None of you. None of you|have ever seen a table fly.
{65150}{65199}Stand back.
{65269}{65375}Heus... mensa... surge!
{65521}{65575}Surge mensa.
{66036}{66111}- Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.|- Enough. That'll do.
{66116}{66184}- I can do this.|- It's not necessary.
{66188}{66295}Tell me, the landslide,|it was accomplished this same way?
{66300}{66333}Er... yes.
{66338}{66409}Did you ever hear of King Gaiseric?
{66414}{66482}Oh, no. Of course not.|You weren't even born.
{66486}{66618}He was my brother. A great king|and a valiant man-at-arms.
{66640}{66713}When he ascended the throne,|the dragon was unbridled.
{66718}{66786}No one knew where|it might strike next,
{66790}{66864}so he brought forth|his broadsword and his spear,
{66869}{66975}assembled his fighters|and went out to do battle.
{67059}{67117}He was never seen again,
{67122}{67230}but his attack provoked terrible|reprisals - villages incinerated,
{67235}{67345}entire crops burned, death, famine...
{67424}{67473}Horrible.
{67530}{67646}How did you arrogate|to yourself the role of saviour?
{67651}{67725}- I was invited.|- Not by me.
{67822}{67937}I think you're nothing|but a boy... an apprentice.
{68016}{68095}Have you considered|the consequences of failure?
{68101}{68187}What failure?|You want the dragon back?
{68190}{68254}You came here|and toyed with a monster!
{68258}{68337}Who are you|to risk our people, our villages?
{68342}{68426}- But your children were dying!|- Only a few.
{68431}{68508}It is better they die|that others might live.
{68513}{68590}I created the lottery - me -
{68595}{68670}and from the moment it began,|the dragon was tamed.
{68675}{68761}- The kingdom has prospered.|- At what price?
{68816}{68900}You can't make|a shameful peace with dragons.
{68905}{69007}- You must kill them as I have done.|- The beast is dead?
{69043}{69087}Yes, it's dead.
{69130}{69179}We shall see.
{70125}{70237}Caela... orrida... aperere.
{70357}{70465}Open up, I say! Caela orrida aperere!
{70470}{70528}Salve, magister juvenilis.
{70558}{70636}I studied Latin. Greek, too.
{70662}{70741}Me apellant Elspeth, filiam Regis.
{70794}{70884}Filiam Regis? You're his daughter.
{70920}{70972}Please don't think ill of us.
{70977}{71078}Father is a wise|and even-handed man. He's...
{71083}{71134}What happened to you?
{71139}{71230}Nothing. Just some|of the King's even-handedness.
{71271}{71345}It... It's better|for everyone this way.
{71350}{71399}A king must protect his people.
{71422}{71497}Naturally.|Just as he protects his daughter.
{71604}{71666}What do you mean by that?
{71700}{71801}- Are you referring to the lottery?|- You know about the lottery?
{71816}{71935}I have participated in every|choosing since I came of age.
{71940}{71989}The whole kingdom knows that.
{71995}{72116}You don't have to pretend.|Not to me. Not down here.
{72181}{72298}Everyone knows|how this... choosing works -
{72332}{72431}the families|with money, royal connections...
{72448}{72526}You've participated|in a lie. You know it.
{72559}{72623}- I have to go now.|- You know I'm right.
{72627}{72678}Vale. Dorme bene.
{72973}{73085}Horsrik, remove all but one bar.|We'll try it one at a time.
{73237}{73290}- I, Casiodorus Rex...|- Father...
{73295}{73383}do some families pay bribes|to stay out of the lottery?
{73389}{73428}Nonsense.
{73450}{73553}By the power of this amulet,|justly wielded by my hand
{73557}{73614}in accordance|with the laws of Urland,
{73621}{73699}now, lead, be thou gold.
{73705}{73761}I'm burnt!
{73767}{73839}Have you ever kept|my name off the lottery list?
{73843}{73892}What are you suggesting?
{73907}{73996}Am I not exposed to the same risk|as other men's daughters?
{74002}{74079}There's been a loose tongue|here somewhere, sire.
{74084}{74166}- Where did you get such ideas?|- Answer my question.
{74172}{74304}Please... Don't think|of such things, I beg you.
{74308}{74380}- Answer me.|- The answer is no.
{74385}{74453}I mean yes. You are a participant.
{74457}{74534}We have seen to that.|How could we not?
{74539}{74576}Yes...
{74606}{74657}The answer is yes.
{74713}{74769}- You are lying to me.|- Elspeth!
{75220}{75269}Stay calm.
{75640}{75685}Go on.
{75988}{76035}You little meddler!
{76077}{76121}Stop him!
{76428}{76527}Close the gate!|What are you waiting for, idiots?
{76590}{76641}Stop him!
{77113}{77158}Tyrian!
{77197}{77296}In here! So much for your magic.|So much for your sorcery.
{77337}{77394}Feel that? It's alive.
{78054}{78179}Listen to me. The moment of our fear|is the hour of our triumph.
{78207}{78268}This is a sign from God.
{78358}{78471}Horns, tail, wings|and clawed feet - this is no dragon.
{78476}{78525}This is Lucifer!
{78577}{78629}Dear Father, we beseech thee,
{78635}{78732}show us thy goodness|in this evil place.
{78736}{78787}Show us thy power.
{78792}{78933}Cursed worm, a devil flung|from Heaven will now rise from Hell!
{79064}{79130}Stay and fear the word of God!
{79155}{79208}You call yourselves Christians?!
{79309}{79397}Fear not, brethren.|There is no dragon.
{81204}{81312}Unclean beast! Get thee down!
{81454}{81565}Be thou consumed|by the fires that made thee!
{83505}{83554}- Where is he?|- Not here. Can't help you.
{83855}{83916}As the proud new father of a daughter
{83921}{83983}who has somehow|been overlooked all these years,
{83988}{84081}it may interest you to know|the King has called a new lottery.
{84086}{84135}It's months to the solstice.
{84140}{84216}In view of what's happened,|we all know what's required.
{84221}{84322}I've never taken part|in your cursed lottery. I won't now.
{84398}{84505}You were very clever, but|she will take part like all the rest.
{84522}{84571}No exceptions.
{84576}{84625}- I want to be in it.|- Silence, child.
{84630}{84747}I'm no different to any other girl.|My name will go in.
{84752}{84846}Nothing.|If he was here, he's gone now.
{85516}{85574}Blacksmith,|have you ever forged a weapon?
{86044}{86123}This is "Secarius draconum" - |Dragonslayer.
{86263}{86348}- The best I ever made.|- It's beautiful.
{86353}{86417}But I never had the nerve to use it.
{86678}{86763}That won't help. What you want|to kill isn't flesh and blood.
{86769}{86835}- It'll bleed.|- How do you know?
{86840}{86968}- No one's so much as scratched it.|- She's right. I'll need the amulet.
{89942}{89999}Stir the tiles!
{90005}{90061}Stir the tiles!
{90067}{90168}Stir the tiles! Stir the tiles!
{90285}{90376}Draw the name! Draw the name!
{90382}{90431}Draw the name!
{90436}{90508}Draw the name!
{90513}{90564}Draw the name!
{90769}{90835}Now, my countrymen, hear me.
{90841}{90932}Behold, for I am chosen.
{90937}{90999}I shall die that many may live.
{91005}{91125}I shall lay down my life|for family and fellows.
{91130}{91293}I shall go to my grave for the love|of our king and his wise policy.
{91297}{91371}And my name is...
{91584}{91639}- Read the name!|- Read the name!
{91644}{91700}Read the name!
{91805}{91917}Read the name! Read the name!
{92006}{92055}Read the name.
{92157}{92274}The name|is Princess Elspeth Ulfilas...
{92277}{92343}...filia Regis.
{92382}{92442}That is not the name.|It has been misread.
{92448}{92527}There's no mistake.|The name's been drawn. Let it stand.
{92533}{92628}No. The good Horsrik|has misspoke himself.
{92651}{92764}In fairness to this individual,|we will destroy this tile.
{92769}{92802}No!
{92807}{92861}No. What better name|than your own kin?
{92866}{92942}- At last, we see justice done.|- Silence!
{92947}{92996}We will have a new choosing.
{93024}{93093}I will draw the name myself.
{93098}{93167}Let it stand! Let it stand!
{93349}{93415}The name is as Horsrik read it...
{93483}{93518}Elspeth.
{93651}{93711}And this one... And another...
{93716}{93782}Another... And another...
{93799}{93856}And another. What treachery is this?
{93861}{93966}- The lottery is invalid.|- Hear me, good people.
{93971}{94047}It is true that my name|appears on all the lots.
{94052}{94162}This does not invalidate|the lottery, it certifies it.
{94167}{94216}It redresses an injustice.
{94241}{94361}I have learned that my name was kept|from jeopardy in all past drawings.
{94369}{94457}Therefore, I have substituted|my name for yours
{94463}{94601}for the risk that over the years|you have taken and I have not.
{95887}{95978}You, Tyrian.|Surely you'll do something.
{95983}{96059}If not for me,|out of loyalty to the kingdom.
{96064}{96128}But that's just it, Your Majesty.
{96132}{96205}My first duty|is loyalty to the kingdom.
{96298}{96358}Don't go to all that trouble.
{96419}{96481}If you want a fight,|give me a weapon.
{96486}{96550}- I think not.|- Stop!
{96554}{96611}Don't harm him.
{96616}{96688}And... you, please...
{96762}{96837}I'm a great admirer|of the black arts.
{96842}{96959}You chaps|with your... mysterious spells.
{96964}{97065}I didn't think it would be necessary.|Vermithrax is an old dragon.
{97069}{97156}That, I thought,|was the beauty of my plan - time.
{97161}{97273}We'd wait it out.|I'd live to see the end of it...
{97329}{97401}I will see the end of it.
{97430}{97485}Sire, consider what you are doing.
{97506}{97566}Give him that,|he'll destroy all you've built.
{97572}{97626}He shall have it.
{97656}{97706}It's my daughter.
{97711}{97770}Save her, I beg you.
{98243}{98356}The princess - what's her name? - 
{98372}{98464}Elspeth. Her name's Elspeth.
{98497}{98569}There, good and hot.
{98590}{98670}That's not the kind of fire we need.
{98806}{98896}Nunc per potestatem
{98912}{98998}hermeticum ex flammis,
{99056}{99141}ferrum sanguinarium.
{99850}{99914}Good. Now turn it over.
{102127}{102201}An edge like no other on this earth.
{102405}{102464}I'll say goodbye to her for you.
{102469}{102572}Sorry she's not here.|You know how she is.
{102577}{102626}I understand.
{102691}{102740}Fare thee well.
{103131}{103210}It's a shield. I made it.
{103232}{103316}It might keep the fire|off you, it might not.
{103352}{103404}You know, you're an idiot.
{103409}{103511}You're going to die tonight.|You'll be ripped limb from limb.
{103517}{103621}This is the last time|I'll ever speak to you.
{103663}{103737}- Thank you.|- Another thing...
{103766}{103815}I've been up there.
{103820}{103869}That thing isn't alone.
{103891}{103955}It's got little ones. Young, I think.
{103961}{104038}- I don't know how many.|- They must be killed, too.
{104058}{104108}Anything else?
{104300}{104357}You're in love, aren't you?
{104395}{104439}Yes.
{104514}{104563}It's all right.
{104568}{104626}I understand.
{104631}{104726}She's very beautiful, very brave.
{104752}{104804}Who is? What do you mean?
{104809}{104858}Your princess.
{104934}{104985}But I don't care.
{105089}{105155}Listen to me, Galen Bradwardyn,
{105160}{105211}sorcerer's apprentice...
{105252}{105301}you're going to be dead...
{105330}{105394}the dragon will be worse than ever,
{105398}{105512}there will be more lotteries...|and I'm not a boy any more.
{105518}{105637}- And you'll be eligible because...|- Because I'm still a virgin.
{106053}{106102}I am in love...
{106213}{106272}...but not with the Princess.
{107252}{107302}Your Highness?
{107558}{107700}Now be it known throughout|the kingdom that Princess Elspeth,
{107705}{107812}having lawfully been chosen|by a deed of fortune and destiny...
{108043}{108093}No more smoke, I beg you.
{108099}{108156}Begone!
{108161}{108236}I declare these proceedings...
{108262}{108323}duly ordained!
{108388}{108452}I knew I'd find you here.
{108506}{108581}Well, I'm not|as sentimental as His Majesty.
{108586}{108718}The kingdom, every one of us,|needs this sacrifice.
{108754}{108822}If you intend to interfere...
{108847}{108898}you'll have to kill me.
{109076}{109204}I've plenty of reasons to kill you|that have nothing to do with this.
{109209}{109258}Most impressive.
{109292}{109382}- Can you use it?|- No! Stop!
{109387}{109459}Tyrian is right!|This is our only hope!
{110036}{110075}Tyrian!
{110132}{110202}This is no warrior.
{110447}{110491}Run!
{110605}{110649}Run!
{111000}{111049}Where are you going?
{111160}{111271}You've failed, my friend...|and I thank the gods for it.
{111574}{111648}Now prepare yourself...
{112877}{112926}Elspeth.
{125568}{125617}It's still alive.
{126083}{126149}You know what we have to do.
{126174}{126226}We have to leave.
{126270}{126320}You said you loved me.
{126350}{126399}Is it true?
{126483}{126534}If it is...
{126560}{126624}it's the only good we've done.
{126700}{126754}Let's not lose that, too.
{126813}{126862}Galen?
{126894}{126987}She's right. What kind|of life could you have here?
{127018}{127067}You know what I think?
{127072}{127184}Magic, magicians -|it's all fading from the world.
{127189}{127251}Dying out. That makes me happy.
{127280}{127353}That means|the dragon will be dying, too.
{127493}{127532}Valerian.
{127577}{127626}Something from your father.
{127738}{127792}You want me to wear this?
{127797}{127863}What harm can it do?
{128831}{128880}What is it?
{128905}{128954}What's the matter?
{129101}{129150}What is that?
{129393}{129432}Look.
{129542}{129604}- At what?|- There.
{129630}{129725}That old trickster.|The burning water.
{129747}{129797}The lake of fire.
{129843}{129929}He had it planned...|from the beginning.
{129934}{129988}He knew this was going to happen.
{129993}{130061}Who did? What happened?
{130066}{130157}We've got to go back.|I have to talk to him.
{130176}{130225}Where are you going?
{130338}{130420}We can slay this dragon with prayer.
{130425}{130481}If we but join together in faith,
{130487}{130619}we shall live,|and the beast shall die.
{130625}{130728}Galen, stop!|I won't let you kill yourself.
{130780}{130898}He couldn't make the journey,|so he had us make it for him.
{130903}{130952}Don't you see?
{131047}{131096}All right. I'm coming, too.
{131101}{131184}- No. This is for me to do.|- I'm not afraid.
{131189}{131296}After all, I was a man, remember?
{131404}{131468}Nunc... fax... incendere.
{131501}{131550}Stay close.
{131592}{131641}- What's that?|- Nothing.
{131646}{131720}- I want to see.|- No, you don't.
{131786}{131838}All right. Wait here.
{132070}{132124}Galen?
{132211}{132246}Galen?
{132386}{132442}Where are you?
{132696}{132765}Ex favilla...
{132770}{132843}vita... nova!
{135004}{135138}Sic redit magnus ex terra mortuorum.
{135281}{135330}You're back!
{135344}{135457}- I thank the powers that made me.|- Glad to see you, too.
{135462}{135563}You didn't bring along anything|to eat, by any chance?
{135568}{135660}- Food?|- But come along. There's much to do.
{135665}{135797}No, please...|I thought I was a sorcerer. I'm not.
{135824}{135890}I thought I had power. I don't.
{135895}{135954}You said to be strong. I wasn't.
{135960}{136028}But you were, my boy. You were.
{136033}{136082}And you'll be stronger yet.
{136138}{136235}Thou art baptised in the name of|the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost.
{136241}{136346}And may the Lord lead us|from darkness and demons...
{136352}{136396}Look!
{137727}{137819}Draco... draconum.
{138106}{138150}Galen!
{138296}{138345}This is Valerian.
{138363}{138412}I know. I remember.
{138438}{138529}The girl who came to us as a boy.
{138577}{138636}There's something you must do.
{138651}{138686}Anything.
{138727}{138787}I want you to destroy the amulet...
{138873}{138933}...and me along with it.
{139118}{139225}You brought me from the flames,|you must send me back.
{139253}{139317}You'll know the time.
{139322}{139439}You must act|while life is still in me.
{140544}{140604}Tempestus!
{140764}{140828}Imber!
{141422}{141457}Fulmen!
{141811}{141844}There.
{143594}{143658}Here, Galen. Do what he said.
{143663}{143733}Destroy the amulet. Smash it.
{143745}{143815}No! He said I'd know the time.
{145191}{145247}- He told you to do it!|- Not yet!
{147094}{147133}Galen!
{149360}{149507}Let us pray. We thank thee, Lord,|for this divine deliverance.
{149512}{149609}Verily is thy presence|amongst us fully manifest
{149613}{149672}in this, thy great work.
{150168}{150217}Arise, children of the Lord.
{150248}{150325}Forsake forever the pagan mysteries,
{150330}{150398}the superstitions of the past.
{150402}{150455}Rejoice in the power of God...
{150460}{150555}All hail Casiodorus Rex -
{150560}{150609}Dragonslayer.
{150854}{150938}- You miss Ulrich?|- Yes.
{150943}{151015}- And the amulet?|- That, too.
{151029}{151109}I don't. I'm glad it's gone.
{151114}{151183}You may not be a sorcerer,|Galen Bradwardyn,
{151188}{151254}but that doesn't matter, not to me.
{151258}{151324}I know. I just wish...
{151362}{151430}- What?|- We had a horse.

I'm gonna turn over the next card.
I want you to concentrate.
I want you to teII me what you think it is.
Square.
Good guess. But wrong.
CIear your head.
AII right. TeII me what you think it is.
Is it a star?
It is a star. Very good. That's great.
Okay. AII right.
Think hard. What is it?
CircIe.
CIose. But definiteIy wrong.
Okay.
-AII right. Ready?
-Yeah.
AII right.
What is it?
Come on.
Figure eight.
IncredibIe. That's 5 for 5.
You can't see these, can you?
-You're not cheating me, are you?
-No, I swear they're just coming to me.
Okay.
-Nervous?
-Yes. I don't Iike this.
You onIy have 75 more to go, okay?
What's this one?
It's a coupIe of wavy Iines.
-Sorry. This isn't your Iucky day.
-I know.
Wait--
I'm getting a IittIe tired of this!
You voIunteered, didn't you?
We're paying, aren't we?
Yeah, but I didn't know you were gonna give me eIectric shocks!
What are you trying to prove here, anyway?
I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP abiIity.
The effect? I'II teII you what the effect is. It's pissing me off!
WeII, then maybe my theory is correct!
-You can keep the 5 bucks. I've had it.
-I wiII, mister!
You may as weII get used to that.
It's the kind of resentment that your abiIity wiII provoke in some peopIe.
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
You're no fIuke, Jennifer.
This is it. This is definiteIy it!
Did those UV Ienses come in for the video camera?
And that bIank tape, I need it, the one you erased yesterday.
-WiII you excuse me for a second?
-Sure.
I'm right in the middIe of something, Ray.
I need more time with this subject.
CouId you come back in an hour, hour and a haIf?
Peter, at 1 :40 p.m...

PubIic Library on Fifth Avenue...

It bIew books off sheIves from 20 feet away...
...and scared the socks off some poor Iibrarian.
I'm very excited. I'm very pIeased.
I want you to get right down there, check it out, and get back to me.
You're coming with us on this one.
SpengIer went down there.
He took PKE vaIences, went right off the top of the scaIe.
Buried the needIe.
We're cIose on this one. I can feeI it.
I can feeI it. We're very, very cIose.
I have to go now, Jennifer, but I'd
Iike to work with you some more.
Perhaps you couId come back this evening, say at--?
Eight o'cIock?
I was just going to say, ''8:00?''
You are a Iegitimate phenomenon.
As a friend, I must say...
...you've finaIIy gone around the bend on this ghost business.
You guys have been meeting every schizo in the five boroughs...
...who says he has a paranormaI experience. What have you seen?
You forget, I was there at an undersea, unexpIained mass sponge migration.
Oh, Ray, the sponges migrated about a foot and a haIf.
-You're here.
-Yeah, what have you got?
This is big, this is very big.
There's definiteIy something here.
Egon, this reminds me of the time you tried to driII a hoIe through your head.
-Remember that?
-That wouId've worked if--
I'm Roger DeIacorte.
Are you the men from the university?
Yes. I'm Dr. Venkman.
Dr. Stantz. Egon.
Thank you for coming. I hope we can cIear this up quickIy and quietIy.
Let's not rush things. We don't even know what you have yet.
I don't remember seeing any Iegs...
...but it definiteIy had arms, because it reached out for me.
Arms? I can't wait to get a Iook at this thing.
AIice, I'II ask you a coupIe of standard questions, okay?
Have you or any member of your famiIy...
...ever been diagnosed schizophrenic, mentaIIy incompetent?
My uncIe thought he was St. Jerome.
I'd caII that a big yes.
Are you habituaIIy using drugs, stimuIants, aIcohoI?
-No.
-No, no. Just asking.
Are you, AIice, menstruating right now?
-What has that got to do with it?
-Back off, man. I'm a scientist.
Ray, it's moving. Come on.
Look!
-This is hot, Ray.
-SymmetricaI book-stacking.
Just Iike the PhiIadeIphia mass turbuIence of 1 94 7.
You're right. No human being wouId stack books Iike this.
Listen! Do you smeII something?
TaIk about teIekinetic activity.
Look at this mess.
Raymond, Iook at this.
EctopIasmic residue.
-Venkman, get a sampIe of this.
-It's the reaI thing.
Somebody bIows their nose, and you wanna keep it?
I'd Iike to anaIyze it.
-There's more over here.
-I'm getting stronger readings here.
This way.
Come on.
Egon, your mucus.
This happen to you before?
First time?
It's here.
A fuII torso apparition. And it's reaI.
So, what do we do?
CouId you come over here and taIk to me for a second, pIease?
CouId you just come here for a second, pIease?
Right over here.
Come here, Francine. Come here.
-What do we do?
-I don't know. What do you think?
Stop that!
We've gotta make contact.
One of us shouId try to speak to it.
Good idea.
HeIIo.
I'm Peter.
Where are you from? OriginaIIy.
AII right. Okay.
The usuaI stuff isn't working.
Okay, I have a pIan.
I know exactIy what to do.
Now, stay cIose.
Stay cIose.
I know. Do exactIy as I say.
Get ready. Ready?
Get her!
-Did you see it? What was it?
-We'II get back to you.
Wait!
''Get her.'' That was your whoIe pIan.
Get her.
-It was scientific.
-I just got overexcited.
But wasn't it incredibIe, Pete?
We actuaIIy touched the etheric pIane.
You know what this couId mean to the schooI?
Yeah, it's gonna be bigger than the microchip.
The experience wasn't compIeteIy wasted.
According to these readings, we have an exceIIent chance...
...of catching and hoIding a ghost.
This is great. If the ionization rate is constant for aII ectopIasmic entities...
...we couId reaIIy bust some heads.
In a spirituaI sense, of course.
Spengs, you serious about this catching a ghost?
I'm aIways serious.
Egon, I'm gonna take back some of the things I've said about you.
You've earned it.
The possibiIities are IimitIess.
Hey, Dean Yeager.
I trust you're moving us to better quarters on campus.
No, you're being moved off campus.
The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.
You are to vacate these premises immediateIy.
This is preposterous.
I demand an expIanation.
Fine. This university wiII no Ionger continue...
...any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
But the kids Iove us.
Dr. Venkman, we beIieve the purpose of science is to serve mankind.
You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of dodge or hustIe.
Your theories are the worst kind of popuIar tripe.
Your methods are sIoppy, and your concIusions are highIy questionabIe.
You are a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman.
I see.
And you have no pIace in this department or in this university.
This is a major disgrace.
Forget MIT or Stanford now.
They wouIdn't touch us with a 1 0-meter cattIe prod.
You're aIways so concerned about your reputation.
Einstein did his best stuff when he was working as a patent cIerk.
You know how much a patent cIerk earns?
The university gave us money.
We didn't have to produce anything.
You've never been out of coIIege.
You don't know what it's Iike.
I've worked in the private sector.
They expect resuIts.
For whatever reasons, Ray...
...caII it fate, caII it Iuck, caII it karma...
...I beIieve that everything happens for a reason.
I beIieve that we were destined to get thrown out of this dump.
-For what purpose?
-To go into business for ourseIves.
This ecto-containment system
SpengIer and I have in mind...
...wiII require a Ioad of capitaI.
Where wiII we get the money?
I don't know. I don't know.
You're never gonna regret this, Ray.
My parents Ieft me that house.
I was born there.
You won't Iose the house. Everybody has three mortgages nowadays.
But at 1 9 percent?
You didn't even bargain with the guy.
Ray, for your information, the interest rate aIone...
...for the first five years comes to 95,000 doIIars.
WiII you guys reIax? We are on the threshoId of estabIishing...
...the indispensabIe defense science of the next decade:
ProfessionaI paranormaI investigations and eIiminations.
The franchise rights aIone wiII make us rich beyond our wiIdest dreams.
There's office space, sleeping quarters and showers...
...and there's a fuII kitchen.
It just seems a IittIe pricey for a unique fixer-upper opportunity, that's aII.
What do you think, Egon?
I think this buiIding shouId be condemned.
There's metaI fatigue in aII the Ioad-bearing members.
The wiring is substandard.
It's inadequate for our power needs.
And the neighborhood is Iike a demiIitarized zone.
Hey, does this poIe stiII work?
Wow, this pIace is great.
When can we move in?
You gotta try this poIe.
I'm gonna get my stuff.
Hey, we shouId stay here tonight, sIeep here. You know, to try it out.
-I think we'II take it.
-Good.
Hi.
-Dana, it's you.
-Hi. Yes, Louis, it's me.
-I thought it was the drugstore.
-Are you sick?
No, I'm fine. I feeI great.
Just ordered some more vitamins and stuff. I was just exercising.
I taped 20-Minute Workout and pIayed it at high speed...
...so it onIy took 1 0 minutes.
I got a great workout.
Want to come in for a mineraI water?
I'd reaIIy Iike to, Louis, but I have a rehearsaI. Excuse me.
No sweat.
I'II take a rain check on that.
I have pIenty of Iow-sodium mineraI water and other nutritious foods.
-But you aIready know that.
-I know that.
Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a big party for aII my cIients.
My fourth anniversary as an accountant.
Even though you do your own tax return...
...stop by, since you're my neighbor and aII.
Thank you, Louis.
I'II reaIIy try to stop by.
You shouIdn't Ieave your TV on so Ioud when you go out.
The creep down the haII phoned the manager.
That's strange.
I didn't reaIize I Ieft it on.
I cIimbed on the Iedge and tried to disconnect the cabIe...
...but I couIdn't get in, so I turned up my TV reaI Ioud too...
...so everyone wouId think both our
TVs had something wrong with them.
Okay, so I'II see you Iater, huh?
I'II give you a caII.
I gotta have a shower.
Are you troubled by strange noises in the middle of the night?
Do you experience feelings of dread in your basement or attic?
Have you or any of your family ever seen a spook, specter or ghost?
If the answer is yes, pick up your phone and call the professionals.
Ghostbusters.
Our courteous staff is on call
2 4 hours a day...
...to serve all your supernatural-elimination needs.
We're ready to believe you.
ZuuI.
You don't think it's too subtIe?
You don't think peopIe are gonna drive down and not see the sign?
You can't park that here!
Everybody can reIax, I found the car.
Needs some suspension work and shocks...
...and brakes, brake pads, Iinings, steering box, transmission, rear end.
-How much?
-OnIy 4800.
Maybe new rings, aIso muffIers, a IittIe wiring.
-Janine, any caIIs?
-No.
-Any messages?
-No.
-Any customers?
-No, Dr. Venkman.
It's a good job, isn't it?
Type something, wiII you?
We're paying for this stuff.
Don't stare at me.
You've got the bug eyes.
Janine?
Sorry about the ''bug eyes'' thing.
I'II be in my office.
You're very handy. I can teII.
-I bet you Iike to read a Iot too.
-Print is dead.
Oh, that's very fascinating to me.
I read a Iot myseIf.
Some peopIe think I'm too inteIIectuaI, but it's a fabuIous way to spend time.
I aIso pIay racquetbaII.
Do you have any hobbies?
I coIIect spores, moIds and fungus.
HeIIo?
Excuse me. Is this--?
This is the Ghostbusters' office.
Yes, it is. Can I heIp you?
I don't have an appointment.
I'd Iike to taIk to someone, pIease.
I'm Peter Venkman. May I heIp you?
WeII, I don't know. What I have to say may sound a IittIe unusuaI.
That's aII we get, day in, day out, around this pIace.
-Come into my office, Miss....
-Barrett. Dana Barrett.
And this voice said, ''ZuuI,'' and then I sIammed the refrigerator door and Ieft.
That was two days ago, and I haven't been back to my apartment.
GeneraIIy, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appIiance.
What do you think it was?
WeII, if I knew what it was,
I wouIdn't be here.
Egon, what do you think?
She's teIIing the truth.
At Ieast she thinks she is.
WeII, of course I'm teIIing the truth.
Who wouId make up a story Iike that?
Some are peopIe who just want attention.
Others are nutbaIIs who come off the street.
You know what it couId be? Past Iife experience intruding on present time.
CouId be a memory stored in the coIIective unconscious.
I wouIdn't ruIe out cIairvoyance or teIepathic contact either.
I'm sorry, I don't beIieve in any of those things.
WeII, that's aII right. I don't either.
But there are some things we do...
...standard procedures in a case
Iike this, which often bring us resuIts.
I couId go to HaII of Records for the buiIding's structuraI detaiIs.
Maybe the buiIding has a history of psychic turbuIence.
Right. Good idea.
I couId search ''ZuuI'' in the usuaI Iiterature.
-Spates Catalog.
-Tobin's Spirit Guide.
I'II take Miss Barrett back to her apartment and check her out.
I'II go check out
Miss Barrett's apartment. Okay?
Okay.
Thank you.
PIease, Iet me.
If something's gonna happen here,
I want it to happen to me first.
That's the cIoset.
They hate this.
I Iike to torture them.
That's right, boys. It's Dr. Venkman!
It's a Iot of space.
-Just you?
-Yes.
Good.
What is that thing you're doing?
It's technicaI.
It's one of our IittIe toys.
I see.
That's the bedroom.
But nothing ever happened in there.
What a crime.
You know, you don't act
Iike a scientist.
-They're usuaIIy pretty stiff.
-You're more Iike a game-show host.
That's the kitchen, huh?
-Dana, are these the eggs?
-Yes.
I was over there, and these eggs just jumped right out of their sheIIs...
-...and started to cook on the counter.
-That is weird.
That's when I started to hear that awfuI noise coming from the refrigerator.
You've come aII this way. WouId you
Iike to check the refrigerator?
Better check the fridge. Good caII.
Oh, my God.
Look at aII the junk food.
-No. Goddamn it! This wasn't--
-You actuaIIy eat this stuff?
This wasn't here.
There was nothing here.
There was a space and a buiIding with fIames coming out of it.
There were creatures writhing around, and they were growIing and snarIing.
And there were fIames, and I heard a voice say, ''ZuuI.''
It was right here.
I'm sorry, I'm not getting any reading.
WeII, are you sure you're using that thing correctIy?
I think so. But I'm sure there are no animaIs in there.
WeII, that's great.
Either I have a monster in my kitchen, or I'm compIeteIy crazy.
I don't think you're crazy.
Oh, good. That makes me feeI so much better.
Let me teII you something about me.
I come home from work to my pIace, and aII I have is my work.
There's nothing eIse in my Iife.
I meet you and say, ''There's someone with the same probIem I have.''
Yes, we both have the same probIem. You.
I'm gonna go for broke.
-I am madIy in Iove with you.
-I don't beIieve this.
WiII you pIease Ieave?
And then she threw me out of her Iife.
She thought I was a creep.
She thought I was a geek, and she probabIy wasn't the first.
You are so odd.
-No.
-I've got it!
-No.
-I'II prove myseIf to you.
That's not necessary.
-Yeah, I'II soIve your IittIe probIem.
-Okay.
And then you'II say, ''Pete Venkman's a guy who can get things done.
-I wonder what makes him tick.''
-I wonder.
''I wonder if he'd be interested in knowing what makes me tick.''
I'II bet you're gonna be thinking about me after I'm gone.
I bet I am.
No kiss?
To our first customer.
To our first and onIy customer.
I'II need to draw some petty cash.
I shouId take her out to dinner.
We don't want to Iose her.
This magnificent feast here represents the Iast of the petty cash.
Hey, sIow down. Chew your food.
HeIIo, Ghostbusters.
Yes, of course they're serious.
You do?
You have?
No kidding.
WeII, just give me the address.
Yes, of course.
Oh, they'II be totaIIy discreet.
Thank you.
We got one!
It's a caII!
Come on!
Hey, anybody see a ghost?
-Thank you for coming so quickIy.
-Jesus!
The guests are asking questions, and I'm running out of excuses.
Has it happened before?
WeII, most of the originaI staff knows about the 1 2th fIoor.
-The disturbances, I mean.
-Yeah.
But it's been quiet for years up untiI two weeks ago.
It was never, ever this bad, though.
-Did you ever report it to anyone?
-No. Heavens, no.
The owners don't Iike us to even taIk about it.
I hope we couId take care of this quietIy.
-It's done.
-Tonight.
Yes, sir. Don't worry.
We handIe this kind of thing aII the time.
What are you supposed to be, some kind of a cosmonaut?
No, we're exterminators. Somebody saw a cockroach up on 1 2th.
-That's gotta be some cockroach.
-Bite your head off, man.
-Going up?
-I'II take the next one.
It just occurred to me we haven't had a successfuI test of this equipment.
-I bIame myseIf.
-So do I.
-WeII, no sense worrying about it now.
-Why worry?
Each of us is wearing an unIicensed nucIear acceIerator on his back.
Yep. WeII, Iet's get ready.
Switch me on.
What the heII are you doing?
-Sorry.
-I'm sorry.
We thought you were someone eIse.
SuccessfuI test.
I guess so.
-I think we'd better spIit up.
-Good idea.
Yeah, we can do more damage that way.
Venkman? Venkman!
Disgusting bIob.
I'm gonna have to hoId him myseIf.
Come in, Ray.
Venkman! I saw it! I saw it!
It's right here, Ray.
It's Iooking at me.
He's an ugly little spud, isn't he?
I think he can hear you, Ray.
Don't move. It won't hurt you.
Venkman!
Venkman! Pete!
Venkman, what happened?
Are you okay?
He sIimed me.
That's great! ActuaI physicaI contact!
-Can you move?
-Ray. Ray! Come in, please!
I feeI so funky.
SpengIer! I'm with Venkman.
He got sIimed!
That's great, Ray. Save some for me.
Get down here, right away!
It just went into a ballroom.
Okay, we'II be right there.
Sir, if you and your staff couId pIease wait out here...
...we'II take care of everything.
There it is. On the ceiIing.
That's the one that got me.
AII right, boys.
Ready?
Throw it!
I did that. I did that.
-That's my fauIt.
-It's okay. The tabIe broke the faII.
There's something very important
I forgot to teII you.
-What?
-Don't cross the streams.
-Why?
-It wouId be bad.
I'm fuzzy on the whoIe goodlbad thing.
What do you mean, ''bad''?
Imagine aII Iife as you know it stopping instantaneousIy and every moIecuIe...
...in your body expIoding at the speed of Iight.
TotaI protonic reversaI.
Right, that's bad. Okay, important safety tip. Thanks, Egon.
AII right, Ray, take the Ieft.
Egon, take the right.
Okay, Ray, just give me one high and outside.
Ray!
Egon!
Okay, aII right.
HoId it, hoId it, hoId it!
Nice shooting, Tex!
I assure you, there is no probIem with the room.
It'II be ready as soon as your guests are with us.
It took something out of him, but he'II move.
I need some room to put the trap down. Give me some room.
You'II excuse me, pIease.
-Gotta get this in the cIear.
-Wait, wait, wait!
I've aIways wanted to do this.
And....
-The fIowers are stiII standing!
-Okay, on my go-signaI.
SpengIer, I want a confinement stream from you, okay? Go!
Okay, hoId him up there.
He's gonna move. HoId him up!
Go!
-It's working, Ray.
-Start bringing him down.
You got him. Don't cross the stream.
Maybe now you'II never sIime a guy with a positron coIIider, huh?
Venkman, shorten your stream.
I don't want my face burned off.
I'm opening the trap now.
Don't Iook directIy into the trap.
I Iooked at the trap, Ray.
Turn your streams off when I cIose the trap. Get ready. I'm cIosing it.
Now!
It's in there.
WeII, that wasn't such a chore, now, was it?
Mr. Smith, quickIy.
I want that door open now!
DonaId, stand over there.
We came, we saw, we kicked its ass!
Did you see it? What is it?
We got it.
What is it?
WiII there be any more of them?
What you had there was what we refer to as a focused...
...non-terminaI repeating phantasm, or a cIass-five fuII-roaming vapor.
ReaI nasty one too.
And now...
...Iet's taIk seriousIy.
For the entrapment, we're gonna have to ask you for four big ones, $4000.
But we are having a speciaI this week on proton charging...
...and storage of the beast.
That's onIy gonna come to
1 000 doIIars, fortunateIy.
Five thousand doIIars? I had no idea it'd be so much. I won't pay it.
WeII, that's aII right.
We can just put it back.
We certainIy can, Dr. Venkman.
No! AII right! Anything.
Thanks so much.
Thank you. Hope we can heIp you again.
Coming through! One cIass-five free-roaming vapor.
Morning, I'm Roger Grimsby.
Today, the entire Eastern seaboard...
...is alive with talk of incidents of paranormal activity.
Alleged ghost-sightings and supernatural occurrences...
...have been reported across the entire tri-state area.
Everybody has heard ghost stories around the campfire.
My grandma used to spin yarns about a spectraI Iocomotive...
...that wouId rocket past the farm where she grew up.
But now, as if some unforeseen authority....
Stand aside, pIease!
Hi, this is Larry King. The phone-in topic, ghosts and ghostbusting.
The controversy buiIds, more sightings are reported.
Some maintain that these...
...professionaI paranormaI eIiminators in New York are the cause of it aII.
I got it! I got it!
Pete! Ray!
Still making headlines all across the country...
...the Ghostbusters are at it again, this time at the dance club...
... The Rose. The boys in gray slugged it out with a pesky poltergeist...
...then stayed to dance with the ladies who witnessed the disturbance.
This is Casey Kasem.
Now on with the countdown.
Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.
No job is too big. No fee is too big.
Is it just a mist, or does it have arms and Iegs?
As they say in TV, I'm sure there's one big question...
...on everybody's mind, and I imagine you are the man to answer that.
How is Elvis, and have you seen him lately?
Do you beIieve in UFOs, astraI projections...
...mentaI teIepathy, ESP, cIairvoyance...
...spirit photography, teIekinetic movement...
...fuII-trance mediums, the Loch Ness monster and the theory of AtIantis?
If there's a steady paycheck in it,
I'II beIieve anything you say.
I gotta get some sIeep. I'm dying.
You don't Iook good.
-I don't?
-WeII, you've Iooked better.
You didn't used to Iook Iike this.
Can you hoId, pIease?
Here's the paper on the BrookIyn.
She paid with Visa.
Here's tonight's worksheet.
Oh, great. Two more free repeaters.
This is Winston Zeddmore.
He's here about the job.
BeautifuI. You're hired.
Ray Stantz, Pete Venkman.
-CongratuIations.
-Can you heIp me, pIease?
WeIcome aboard.
I don't know where they get these guest conductors.
It's not gonna do him much good to scream at us in German.
WeII, I don't think that the man is competent to conduct...
...a major symphony orchestra.
-CouId you wait here a minute?
-Sure.
Dr. Venkman. This is a surprise.
-That was a wonderfuI rehearsaI.
-You heard that?
Yes. You're the best one in your row.
Oh, thank you.
You're good. Most peopIe can't hear me with the whoIe orchestra pIaying.
I don't have to take this abuse.
I got hundreds of peopIe dying to abuse me.
I know. You're a big ceIebrity now.
Do you have some information for me on my case?
Who's the stiff?
The ''stiff'' happens to be one of the finest musicians in the worId.
Do you have information for me, pIease?
WeII, sure, but I prefer to give it to you in private.
-Why don't you teII me now.
-Okay. I found the name ZuuI for you.
The name ZuuI refers to a demigod worshiped around 6000 B.C. by the....
What's that word?
-''Hittites.''
-Hittites...
...the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.
''ZuuI was the minion of Gozer.''
What's Gozer?
-Gozer was very big in Sumeria.
-WeII, what's he doing in my icebox?
I'm working on that. If we couId get together Thursday night...
...I'm thinking 9-ish, you know, we couId exchange information.
I can't see you Thursday. I'm busy.
Miss Barrett, you seem to think there is something wrong up here that says:
''He enjoys taking his evenings off and spending it with his cIients.''
No. I'm making a speciaI exception in your case...
...because...
...I respect you.
It's corny, but I respect you as an artist.
As a dresser too. This is a magnificent coordination you have going today.
-See you Thursday.
-I'II bring the Roylance Guide...
...and we'II eat and read.
-So who the heII is that?
-He's just a friend.
-A friend?
-An oId friend.
Bye! WeII, I'II see you Thursday!
I'm sorry I didn't get to meet you, sir.
I'm gIad you're feeIing much better.
You're stiII very paIe, though.
A IittIe sun.
-WeII, what does he do?
-He's a scientist.
This is where we store aII the vapors and entities and sIimers that we trap.
Very simpIe, reaIIy. A Ioaded trap here. Open, unIock the system.
Insert the trap.
ReIease.
CIose, Iock the system.
Set your entry grid.
Neutronize your fieId.
And...
...when the Iight is green, the trap is cIean.
The ghost is incarcerated here in our custom storage faciIity.
There's a man from the EPA here to see you. He's waiting in your office.
-EPA? What's he want?
-I don't know.
AII I do know is I've been working two weeks without a break...
...and you promised me you'd hire more heIp.
Janine, someone with your quaIifications...
...wouId have no troubIe finding a topfIight job in either...
...the food service or housekeeping industries.
-Are you gonna answer that?
-I've quit better jobs than this.
Ghostbusters! What do you want?
-Can I heIp you?
-I'm WaIter Peck.
-Can I heIp you?
-I'm WaIter Peck.
I represent the EnvironmentaI
Protection Agency, the third district.
Great. How's it going down there?
Are you Peter Venkman?
Yes, I'm...
...Dr. Venkman.
ExactIy what are you a doctor of,
Mr. Venkman?
WeII, I have Ph.D.'s in parapsychoIogy and psychoIogy.
I see.
And now you catch ghosts.
Yeah. You couId say that.
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
-I'm not at Iiberty to say.
-And where do you put...
...these ghosts once you catch them?
Into a storage faciIity.
And wouId this storage faciIity be Iocated on these premises?
-Yes.
-And may I see this storage faciIity?
-No.
-And why not, Mr. Venkman?
Because you did not use the magic word.
What is the magic word,
Mr. Venkman?
''PIease.''
May I pIease see the storage faciIity,
Mr. Venkman?
Why do you want to see it?
WeII, because I'm curious.
I want to know more about what you do here.
There've been a Iot of wiId stories in the media...
...and we want to assess any possibIe environmentaI impact...
...from your operation.
For instance, the presence of noxious...
...possibIy hazardous waste chemicaIs in your basement.
Now, you show me what is down there, or I come back with a court order.
You go get a court order, and I'II sue your ass for wrongfuI prosecution!
You can have it your way,
Mr. Venkman.
I'm worried. It's crowded in there, and my data...
...points to something big on the horizon.
What do you mean ''big''?
WeII, Iet's say this Twinkie represents the normaI amount...
...of psychokinetic energy in the New York area.
According to this morning's sampIe, it wouId be a Twinkie...
...35 feet Iong, weighing approximateIy 600 pounds.
That's a big Twinkie.
We couId be on the verge of a fourfoId cross-rip...
...a PKE surge of incredibIe, even dangerous, proportions.
We just had a visit from the
EnvironmentaI Protection Agency.
-How's the grid hoIding up?
-Not good.
TeII him about the Twinkie.
What about the Twinkie?
-Oh, Dana, it's you.
-HeIIo, Louis.
You gotta come in here.
You're missing a cIassic party.
Yes, weII, I wouId, Louis, but I have a date coming over.
You made a date...
-...tonight?
-WeII, I'm sorry, Louis. I forgot.
Oh, that's okay.
You can bring him aIong.
AII right. Maybe we'II stop by, okay?
That's great. I'II teII everybody.
We're gonna pIay Twister, we're gonna do some breakdancing....
Hey--
Hey, Iet me in! It's Louis!
Somebody, Iet me in!
HeIIo?
Hi, Mom.
I've been busy.
WeII.... No, everything is fine.
Yeah. No, just that one time.
Oh, I am.
I wiII.
I won't. Mom, I have to go.
I have a date.
Yes. No, no one you know. It's....
WeII, he's a Ghostbuster.
Those guys on TV.
Yes, weII, I'II have to Iet you know.
Okay. Love to Dad.
Right. Bye. Bye.
Oh, shit.
Do you have any Excedrin or Extra Strength TyIenoI?
Do you have any Excedrin or Extra Strength TyIenoI?
Gee, I think aII I got is acetyIsaIicyIic acid. Generic.
I can get 600 tabIets of that for the same price as 300 of the name brand.
Makes good financiaI sense.
Good advice.
Hey, this is reaI smoked saImon from Nova Scotia, Canada...
...2 4.95 a pound.
It onIy cost me 1 4.1 2 after tax, though.
I'm giving this as a promotionaI expense.
That's why I invited cIients instead of friends. Having a good time, Marv?
How you doing? Have some Brie.
It's at room temperature.
You think it's too warm for Brie?
Louis, I'm going home.
Don't Ieave yet. Listen, maybe if we start dancing...
...other peopIe wiII join in.
Okay.
Oh, don't move.
I just gotta get the door.
-Ted! Annette!
-Hi.
I'm gIad you couId come.
Give me your coats.
Everybody, this is Ted and Annette FIeming.
How are you?
Ted has a smaII carpet-cIeaning business in receivership.
Annette's drawing a saIary from a deferred bonus from two years ago.
They got 1 5,000 Ieft on the house at 8 percent.
So they're okay!
Does anybody want to pIay Parcheesi?
Okay, who brought the dog?
HeIp! There's a bear Ioose in my apartment! HeIp! HeIp!
HeIp!
-What?
-A bear in his apartment.
I'm gonna bring this up at the tenants' meeting.
There's not supposed to be any pets in the buiIding.
Let me in. There's gotta be a way in here. I gotta get--
Somebody, Iet me in!
Nice doggy.
Cute IittIe pooch.
Maybe I got a MiIk-Bone.
-What happened?
-Some moron brought...
...a cougar to a party, and it went berserk.
Hi, I'm going up to Dana Barrett's.
HeIIo?
That's a different Iook for you, isn't it?
Are you the Keymaster?
Not that I know of.
Are you the Keymaster?
Yes.
I'm a friend of his.
He toId me to meet him here.
-I didn't get your name.
-I am ZuuI.
I am the Gatekeeper.
-What are we doing today, ZuuI?
-Prepare for the coming of Gozer.
Gozer, huh?
The Destructor.
Are we stiII going out?
You know, you couId pick up the pIace if you're expecting someone.
Do you want this body?
Is this a trick question?
I guess the roses worked, huh?
Take me now...
...sub-creature.
We never taIk anymore.
Easy. I make it a ruIe never to get invoIved with possessed peopIe.
It's more of a guideIine than a ruIe.
You know, I can--
I want you inside me.
Go ahead. No, I can't.
Sounds Iike you got at Ieast two peopIe in there aIready.
Might be a IittIe crowded.
Come on, why don't you just quit trying...
...to upset and disturb Dr. Venkman and just reIax.
Lie down there. ReIax.
Put your hands on your chest.
What I'd reaIIy Iike to do is taIk to Dana.
I want to taIk to Dana.
Dana, it's Peter.
There is no Dana.
There is onIy ZuuI.
Oh, ZuuIie, you nut. Come on.
Come on, I want to taIk to Dana. Dana.
Just reIax. Come on. Dana.
Dana. Can I taIk to Dana?
There is no Dana, onIy ZuuI.
What a IoveIy singing voice you must have.
Now, I'm gonna count to three, ZuuIie.
And if I don't taIk to Dana...
...there's gonna be some reaI troubIe in this apartment, I think.
One.
Two.
Two and a haIf.
PIease come down.
I am the Keymaster.
The Destructor is coming.
I am the Keymaster.
The Destructor is coming.
The TraveIer. The Destroyer.
Gatekeeper.
I am Vinz.
Vinz CIortho, Keymaster of Gozer.
VoIguus ZiIdrohar, Lord of the
SebouiIIia. Are you the Gatekeeper?
He puIIs the wagon, I make the deaIs. You want a ride?
Wait for the sign.
Then aII prisoners wiII be reIeased.
You wiII perish in fIame, you and aII your kind! Gatekeeper!
What an asshoIe.
-Dropping off or picking up?
-Dropping off.
Just a moment.
-You a Ghostbuster?
-Yes.
We picked up this guy.
We don't know what to do.
BeIIevue doesn't want him.
I'm afraid to Iock him up.
I know you guys are into this stuff, so I figured we'd check.
AII right.
Are you the Gatekeeper?
You better bring him inside.
You are so kind to take care of that man.
You know, you are a reaI humanitarian.
I don't think he's human.
What did you say your name was?
Vinz CIortho, Keymaster of Gozer.
According to this, his name's Louis TuIIy.
Lives on CentraI Park West.
Do you want some coffee, Mr. TuIIy?
-Do I?
-Yes, have some.
Yes, have some.
Vinz, you said before you were waiting for a sign.
-What sign are you waiting for?
-Gozer the TraveIer.
He wiII come in one of the pre-chosen forms.
During rectification of the VuIdronaii, the TraveIer came as a Iarge Torb.
Then, during the third reconciIiation of the Meketrex suppIicants...
...they chose a new form for him, that of a giant SIoar!
Many Shubs and ZuuIs knew what it was to be roasted...
...in the depths of the SIoar that day,
I can teII you.
-Egon.
-Excuse me.
There's something very strange about that man.
I'm usuaIIy very psychic, and I have a terribIe feeIing...
...that something awfuI is gonna happen to you.
I'm afraid you're gonna die.
I'II get it.
-HeIIo?
-Egon, it's Peter.
-Thanks, I've got it.
-I have news from the worId of Gozer.
-What is it, Peter?
-I'm here with Dana Barrett.
It seems the Goz has been putting some moves...
-...on my wouId-be girIfriend.
-How is she?
I think we can get her a guest shot on Wild Kingdom.
I just whacked her up with about 300 cc's of Thorazine.
She's gonna take a IittIe nap now, but she says she's the Gatekeeper.
-Does that make any sense to you?
-Some.
I just met the Keymaster.
He's here with me now.
Oh, wonderfuI. We have to get these two together.
I think that wouId be extraordinariIy dangerous.
Okay, weII, hoId onto him.
I'II be there in a IittIe whiIe.
Good.
Thank you, Vinz. We have to find Ray.
I need him here immediateIy.
Bad news, honey, I gotta go to work.
Hey, wiII you stay here in bed untiI I get back?
-Hey, Ray, do you beIieve in God?
-Never met him.
Yeah, weII, I do. And I Iove
Jesus' styIe, you know?
This roof cap is made of a magnesium-tungsten aIIoy.
What are you so invoIved with there?
These are bIueprints for the ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment...
...and they're very, very strange.
Hey, Ray, do you remember something in the BibIe about...
...the Iast days, when the dead wouId rise from the grave?
I remember ReveIations 7:1 2.
And I Iooked as he opened the sixth seaI.
And behoId, there was a great earthquake.
And the sun became as bIack as sackcIoth.
And the moon became as bIood.
And the seas boiIed.
And the skies feII.
-Judgment day.
-Judgment day.
Every ancient reIigion has its myth about the end of the worId.
Myth? Ray, has it ever occurred to you...
...maybe the reason we've been so busy...
...is because the dead have been rising from the grave?
-How about a IittIe music?
-Yeah.
This way.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Just where do you think you're going?
Step aside, or you'II be arrested for interfering with the poIice.
Oh, no. HoId on. I've seen TV.
You can't come in here...
...without a warrant or a writ.
Cease and Desist AII Commerce order. Seizure of Premises.
Ban of PubIic UtiIities for Non-Licensed Waste HandIers...
...and a federaI
Entry and Inspection order.
Vinz, there's one more test
I'd Iike to perform.
Egon. I tried to stop them.
He says they have a warrant.
-Excuse me, this is private property.
-Shut this off. Shut these aII off.
I'm warning you. Turning off these machines is hazardous.
I'II teII you hazardous.
You're facing prosecution...
...for a haIf-a-dozen environmentaI vioIations.
You shut off these beams, or we shut them off for you.
Understand, this is a high-voItage
Iaser containment system.
SimpIy turning it off wouId be
Iike dropping a bomb in the city.
Don't patronize me. I'm not stupid,
Iike the peopIe you biIk.
At ease, officer. I'm Peter Venkman.
There's been a misunderstanding...
...and I want to cooperate in any way I can.
Forget it. You had your chance to cooperate...
...but you thought it'd be more fun to insuIt me. Now it is my turn, wise-ass.
He wants to shut down the protection grid.
You shut that thing down, we won't be heId responsibIe--
-You'II be responsibIe. Shut it off.
-No, we won't be heId responsibIe.
Don't shut it off. I'm warning you.
I've never seen anything Iike this.
I don't know--
Yeah, I'm not interested in your opinion. Just shut it off.
My friend, don't be a jerk.
-Step aside.
-If he does that again, you shoot him.
You do your job.
Don't teII me how to do mine.
-Thank you, officer.
-Shut it off!
Oh, shit.
CIear the buiIding!
This is it. This is the sign.
Yeah, it's a sign, aII right.
We're going out of business.
Hey, aim up there.
-What happened?
-Storage faciIity bIew.
-He shut off the protection grid.
-Oh, great.
-That's bad, isn't it?
-Yeah.
-Where's the Keymaster?
-Shit.
-Who's the Keymaster?
-Oh, come on.
HoId it. I want this man arrested.
These men are in criminaI vioIation of the EnvironmentaI Protection Act.
-This expIosion is a direct resuIt of it.
-Your mother!
Come on, hoId it! HoId it! HoId it!
CoIumbia BuiIding, 57th Street.
I'm in a hurry, so Iet's not dawdIe.
Hey, guard!
Look, I want to make a phone caII.
I just work with these guys.
I wasn't even there.
The structure of this roof cap is Iike the teIemetry tracker...
...that NASA uses to identify dead puIsars in deep space.
CoId-riveted girders with cores of pure seIenium.
Everybody getting this so far?
So what? I guess they just don't make them Iike they used to.
No. Nobody ever made them Iike this.
The architect was either a certified genius or an authentic wacko.
Ray, for a moment...
...pretend that I don't know anything about metaIIurgy...
...engineering or physics and just teII me what the heII is going on.
You never studied.
The whoIe buiIding is a huge superconductive antenna...
...that was designed and buiIt for the purpose...
...of puIIing in and concentrating spirituaI turbuIence.
Your girIfriend Iives in the corner penthouse of spook centraI.
She's not my girIfriend.
I find her interesting because she's a cIient and sIeeps above her covers.
Four feet above her covers.
She barks. She drooIs. She cIaws.
It's not the girI, Peter, it's the buiIding.
Something terribIe is about to enter our worId. This buiIding is the door.
The architect's name was Ivo Shandor.
I found it in Tobin's Spirit Guide.
He was aIso a doctor.
He performed a Iot of unnecessary surgery.
And then, in 1 920, he started a secret society.
-Let me guess. Gozer worshipers.
-Right.
No studying.
After WorId War I, Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.
He wasn't aIone. He had cIose to a thousand foIIowers when he died.
They conducted rituaIs up on the roof...
...bizarre rituaIs intended to bring about the end of the worId.
And now it Iooks Iike it may actuaIIy happen.
We have to get out of here and find a judge or something.
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey, hey, hey. HoId it.
Are we going to go before a judge to say...
...that a BabyIonian god is gonna drop in on CentraI Park West...
-...and start tearing up the city?
-Sumerian, not BabyIonian.
-Yeah, big difference.
-No offense...
...but I gotta get my own Iawyer.
Okay, Ghostbusters.
The mayor wants to see you guys.
The whoIe isIand's going crazy.
Let's go.
I gotta spIit. The mayor wants to rap with me about some things.
-I am the Keymaster.
-I am the Gatekeeper.
-Back. Back. Stay back.
-Stay back. Stay back.
I've got a city bIowing up, and you aren't giving me answers.
I've got a city bIowing up, and you aren't giving me answers.
We're bIocking the bridges, the roads--
The Ghostbusters are here.
The Ghostbusters.
Okay, the Ghostbusters.
Hey, and where's this Peck?
Peck. I am WaIter Peck, sir, and
I am prepared to make a fuII report.
These men are consummate snowbaII artists.
They use sense and nerve gases to induce haIIucinations.
PeopIe think they're seeing ghosts, and they caII these bozos...
...who show up to deaI with the probIem...
...with a fake eIectronic Iight show.
Everything was fine with our system untiI the power grid...
-...was shut off by dickIess here.
-They caused an expIosion.
-Is this true?
-Yes, it's true. This man has no dick.
Hey, come on. Knock it off.
Hey, break it up!
-AII right.
-WeII, that's what I heard.
This is City HaII.
Now, what am I gonna do here, John?
What is this?
AII I know is that was no Iight show we saw this morning.
I've seen every form of combustion known to man...
...but this beats the heII out of me.
The waIIs in the 53rd Precinct were bIeeding.
-How do you expIain that?
-Good afternoon, gentIemen.
Oh, Your Eminence.
-How are you, Lenny?
-You're Iooking good, Mike.
We're in a reaI fix here.
What do you think I shouId do?
OfficiaIIy, the church wiII not take any position...
...on the reIigious impIications of these phenomena.
PersonaIIy, Lenny...
...I think it's a sign from God.
But don't quote me on that.
That's a smart move, Mike.
I won't caII a press conference...
...and teII everyone to start praying.
I'm Winston Zeddmore, Your Honor.
I've onIy been with the company for a coupIe weeks.
But I gotta teII you, these things are reaI.
Since I joined these men,
I have seen shit that'II turn you white.
WeII, you can beIieve Mr. Pecker.
-My name is Peck.
-Or you couId accept the fact...
...that this city is headed for a disaster of bibIicaI proportions.
-WeII, what do you mean, ''bibIicaI''?
-What he means is OId Testament.
-ReaI wrath-of-God-type stuff.
-ExactIy.
Fire and brimstone down from the skies. Rivers and seas boiIing.
Forty years of darkness.
Earthquakes. VoIcanoes.
The dead rising from the grave.
Human sacrifice. Dogs and cats
Iiving together. Mass hysteria.
Enough! I get the point.
But what if you're wrong?
If I'm wrong, nothing happens.
We go to jaiI, peacefuIIy, quietIy.
We'II enjoy it. But if I'm right...
...and we can stop this thing....
Lenny, you wiII have saved the Iives...
...of miIIions of registered voters.
I don't beIieve you're seriousIy considering Iistening to these men.
Get him out of here.
-Bye.
-I'II fix you. I'm gonna fix you.
I'II get you a nice fruit basket.
I'm going to miss him.
AII right. AII right.
We got work to do. Now, what do you need from me?
Come on, Iet's run some red Iights!
HeIIo, New York.
HeIIo, everybody!
Dr. Ray Stantz, wouId you pIease?
The heart of the Ghostbusters.
Thank you. They Iove you.
They Iove you here.
-I Iike that shirt, friend.
-Ghostbusters! AII right!
Gotta run. Got a date with a ghost.
Okay, whatever happens,
Iet's be professionaI.
We might have to put a IittIe overtime in on this one.
There they are. There they are.
I was in no way prepared for that.
It's aII right. Don't worry.
We're fine. We can handIe it.
We can take it.
They want to pIay rough.
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!
Ghostbusters!
-Wanna pIay rough?
-Yeah.
Let's do it.
Where are we?
It Iooks Iike we're in the teens somewhere.
WeII, when we get to 20, teII me.
I'm gonna throw up.
-Twenty-two. Is this it?
-Yep.
Art deco. Very nice.
-Where is it?
-It's at the end of the haII.
Hey, where do these stairs go?
They go up.
Okay, go ahead. Come on.
Go ahead.
Watch it. Go ahead.
Dana.
Okay, so she's a dog.
It's a girI.
-It's Gozer.
-I thought Gozer was a man.
-It's whatever it wants to be.
-Whatever it is, it's gotta get by us.
Right.
Go get her, Ray!
Gozer the Gozerian?
Good evening. As a duIy designated representative of the city...
...county and state of New York...
...I order you to cease aII supernaturaI activity...
...and return to your pIace of origin...
...or to the nearest convenient paraIIeI dimension.
That ought to do it.
Thanks very much, Ray.
Are you a god?
-No.
-Then die!
Ray, when someone asks you if you're a god, you say, ''Yes.''
AII right. This chick is toast.
-Got your stick?
-HoIding it.
Heat them up!
Smoking!
-Make them hard.
-Ready!
Let's show this prehistoric bitch how we do things downtown.
Throw it!
-NimbIe IittIe minx, isn't she?
-We better go fuII stream.
Aim for the fIattop.
Wasn't so hard.
We neutronized it.
You know what that means?
A compIete particIe reversaI.
And we had the tooIs.
We had the taIent.
It's MiIIer time.
-Ray, this Iooks extraordinariIy bad.
-Oh, no.
What?
Look out!
Sub-creatures. Gozer the Gozerian,
Gozer the Destructor...
...VoIguus ZiIdrohar the TraveIer has come.
Choose and perish.
What do you mean, ''choose''?
We don't understand.
Choose. Choose the form of the Destructor.
Oh, I get it. I get it. Oh, very cute.
Whatever we think of.
If we think of J. Edgar Hoover...
...J. Edgar Hoover wiII appear and destroy us, so empty your heads.
Don't think of anything.
We've onIy got one shot at this.
The choice is made.
The TraveIer has come.
Nobody choosed anything.
-Did you choose anything?
-No.
-Did you?
-My mind is bIank.
I didn't choose anything!
I couIdn't heIp it.
It just popped in there.
What? What just popped in there?
-I tried to think--
-Look!
-No! It can't be.
-What is it?
-It can't be.
-What did you do, Ray?
Oh, shit.
It's the Stay Puft MarshmaIIow Man.
There's something you don't see every day.
I tried to think of a harmIess thing.
Something I Ioved from my chiIdhood.
Something that couId never, ever possibIy destroy us. Mr. Stay Puft.
Nice thinking, Ray.
We used to roast
Stay Puft marshmaIIows...
...by the fire at Camp Waconda.
Ray, has gone bye-bye, Egon.
What have you got Ieft?
Sorry, Venkman. I'm terrified beyond the capacity for rationaI thought.
-Oh, no.
-Mother pus bucket.
Nobody steps on a church in my town.
One, two, three, roast him.
Funny, us going out Iike this.
KiIIed by a 1 00-foot marshmaIIow man.
We've been going about this wrong.
This Mr. Stay Puft is a saiIor.
He's in New York. We get this guy Iaid, we won't have any troubIe.
I have a radicaI idea.
The door swings both ways.
We couId reverse the particIe fIow through the gate.
How?
-We'II cross the streams.
-Excuse me, Egon.
You said crossing the streams was bad.
-Cross the streams.
-You're gonna endanger us.
You're gonna endanger our cIient...
...the nice Iady who paid us in advance before she became a dog.
Not necessariIy. There's definiteIy a very sIim chance we'II survive.
I Iove this pIan. I'm excited to be a part of it. Let's do it.
This job is definiteIy not worth 1 1 ,500 a year.
Hurry.
See you on the other side, Ray.
Nice working with you, Dr. Venkman.
Let's turn them on, SpengIer!
Now, SpengIer!
Get out of here!
Winston.
Are you aII right?
Venkman?
SpengIer!
Venkman!
SpengIer.
Oh, SpengIer. Oh, are you okay?
I feeI Iike the fIoor of a taxicab.
-Venky!
-Yeah, where are you?
Oh, thank God.
-You okay?
-I'm aII right.
-You aII right?
-I'm aII right.
-You aII right?
-Yeah. You okay?
Fine.
It smeIIs Iike barbecued dog hair.
Oh, Venkman.
Oh, Venkman, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I just-- I just forgot.
Look!
Somebody turn on the Iights!
-HeIp! Somebody!
-Go check on that IittIe guy.
What happened?
Where am I?
Oh, hi.
You'II be aII right.
Boy, the superintendent's gonna be pissed.
Are you okay?
Who are you guys?
We're the Ghostbusters.
Who does your taxes?
You know, Mr. TuIIy, you are a most fortunate individuaI.
-I know.
-You have been a participant in...
...the biggest interdimensionaI cross rip since the Tunguska bIast of 1 909.
-FeIt great.
-We'd Iike to get a sampIe...
-...of your brain tissue.
-Okay.
I Iove this town!
Egon!
What's going on?
Does anybody want to interview me?
I'm an eyewitness. I was up there.
I want to go with them in the car.

In a certain time,
in a certain land,
once there lived
and once there was...
A magic kingdom
at the top of the world.
If a traveler came
to that cold, freezing place,
and no traveler ever did,
all he would see
would be ice.
Mountains of ice and snow.
But on certain nights, when the stars of the sky shined like jewels,
a wonderful light
appeared in the heavens;
and then many lights,
all the colors of the rainbow;
and some colors
never seen before.
Way on top,
the north star sparkled.
And suddenly, the ice mountains cracked open...
And beautiful, beautiful
lights pierced the sky, and then, out came the vendegums.
Hundreds of them, all in their bright-colored clothes.
Granny, what's a vendegum?
A vendegum? Those are the little men...
Who live in the ice mountains, way at the top of the world, under the north star.
Some of them are even littler than you.
This is the same story she told last year.
Oh, when's he coming?
When's he gonna get here?
The road from the village must be blocked.
Even those reindeer of his couldn't make it through.
Wouldn't be Christmas without him, though, would it? He hasn't missed one yet.
It's them! Here they come!
All right. Everybody back.
Everybody back, everybody back.
- What did you bring? What did I get?
- Wait.
Don't I hear something first?
Happy Christmas,
Uncle claus!
All right. All right. Here, for you.
And you. Thank you!
Cutting wood all day for the whole village.
It's enough to exhaust any man.
How does he find time
to make all those things?
He makes time.
What can I tell you?
It gives him pleasure.
Little else.
For you.
Just for you.
What is it?
A vendegum.
Just as I was
telling you.
You can't see your hand in front of your face out there. You won't get through.
My reindeer, donner and blitzen, can get through anything.
Come along, Anya.
We must hurry.
More children need their toys on the other side of the forest.
'Bye, dear.
Okay.
Bye!
Bye!
Did you see their faces when they saw the toys?
Ah, yes. They love their
Uncle claus, huh?
Come on, blitzen.
Pull harder!
The children are waiting!
Come on, donner.
Don't drag your hooves.
Hurry along, now.
You can do it, boy.
Come on!
I can't find it, Anya.
I can't find the road.
- Where are we?
Come on, boys.
Don't slow up now!
Hi-up!
Hi-up!
Go! Come on!
Blast!
- Come on, blitzen.
Come on, my good boys.
Donner! Now listen!
Over there, there's food and warmth...
And a bed and straw and hay...
And everything a smart team of reindeer would like!
Here is where
you freeze to death.
Now, come on, my good boys!
Come on!
Claus, come back.
I can't see you.
Oh, my God.
Anya!
Anya! Anya!
Anya. Oh, my God. Anya! Anya!
Anya, please!
Oh!
They're here.
Welcome.
It's them. Vendegum.
The little people?
We prefer to be called elves, if you don't mind.
- You-you--
- I'm the one called dooley.
- We've been expecting you.
- Expecting us?
For a long, long time.
We almost gave up hope!
Where are we?
- Home. 
- No, no, no. Our home is far from-- look at that! Let's go.
Not anymore.
This is your home now.
W-what does he mean?
Uh, you don't understand.
We live in a village far away from this one. Blow! Bits of old ropes, single-hinge runner connectors.
This is unbelievable!
See I'm gonna have
a lot to teach him.
Whoops.
Hi, there.
Hi. I'm the one called patch.
Welcome aboard, sir. Speaking for the boys and myself,
I'd-- oh, you must be the missus!
Me?
Yeah. Well, we were expecting someone nice, but not someone so young and pretty.
-  Were we, boys?
- - No. No.
- Oh, don't be elf-conscious! - My friends, let us show you your new home.
Patch, take charge of the reindeer.
 Yeah. Honka!
Take charge of the reindeer. Boog, take charge of the reindeer.
Vout, take charge of the reindeer.
I don't understand.
What new home?
There's nothing here.
Look again.
- Where did it come from?
-  It was always here.
But it can't be seen by just anyone, you know. Mm?
Come, fellow elves. Take them to their new home.
Lead and follow,
follow and lead.
He's nice, isn't he, patch?
Yeah, I tell you, boys, he gives me a real feeling of elf-confidence.
What's it all about?
Maybe it's a-- aah!
No, we're awake!
It's him! He's here!
Yes, he's here, he's here!
Welcome, welcome. I'm the one called puffy.
We've been expecting you.
Not now, puffy. The man wants to see the sights.
- Isn't this something? - Did you hear that? He said it's something!
- He did. He did!
- Oh, my!
She likes it. She likes it!
She does. She does.
Isn't this something? Is it warm enough for all of them?
It's exactly what
I've been saying, ma'am.
Now, I have an idea for a new way to heat this entire place, using pipes!
Pipes, you know?
Cylinder thingies?
There's much more to see, folks.
Pipes.
Pipes.
Yeah.
Wait! Wait!
Oh!
My goodness.
What is all this?
They're Christmas toys.
Waiting for you.
For me.
Wh-what have they got to do with me?
You're going to give them to your children.
Th-there must be a mistake.
We have no children.
You do now.
You have all the children of the world.
But how could I deliver all these toys?
I won't live long enough for that.
Both of you will live forever.
Like us.
Anya?
Me too.
I can't sleep either.
I don't want to sleep.
This mattress is so comfortable,
I don't want to miss
a moment of it.
This-this won't take long.
I'll be right back.
What is it, donner, eh?
You look so frightened.
There's nothing
to worry about.
Really, there isn't. Easy, boy, it's all right. Easy, now, easy.
Strange place, strange companions.
But we're all friends here.
We are!
- Look at old blitz in there.
- Does he look worried? Hmm?
Come on. Maybe try and eat something. Hmm?
It's great food.
Believe me.
Say, look.
Even I like it.
It's delicious.
Mmm! He's like me, I guess.
Oh! Yes.
A little confused.
Yeah, yeah.
He's always been the fidgety type.
Yeah. Well, he'll be all right, sir, as soon as he gets used to the place.
He just needs a little elf-control. Mm.
Well, you certainly know your reindeer.
These are fine specimens. Oh! Hear that, boys? You made a good impression.
Come on.
Look. These two are twins.
Prancer and dancer.
The way you can tell them apart is by those snooty monocles.
Prancer's is on his right eye,
and dancer's is
on his left eye.
And this lad with the great big antlers is comet.
And old spotted-nose here is cupid.
This white-faced boy here, that's old dasher.
He loves to run, he does, he really does.
He'd rather run than eat!
And, uh, this noisy one with the floppy jowls, he's ViXen.
Keep you up half the night
with his snorts and whinnies,
whinnies and snorts.
And you sleep here?
Yes!
And this is where
I do my other work.
Yeah, they keep you busy, huh?
Well, I-I-I like it that way.
Sometimes I get so many ideas, I don't know where to keep them in my head.
Um-- oh! Look.
A clock that wakes you up in the morning.
How about that? Ha?
That's not bad.
Aha!
A plate that whistles when the food's too hot.
Ah?
Um-- oh!
Look, look, look.
I've got here a complete syste-- uh-- what do we need all these reindeer for?
Uh, you'll see.
This is a curious kind of place.
This is nothing now.
- Wait till you see how it gets during season's greetings. - Season's greetings?
-  Mm-hmm. You'll see.
- What's that?
Oh, look, sir.
Now he's having a bite.
- Ooh!
- Ooh!
- Hurray!
- Hoop-ah!
♫
Maybe it's the massive bulk of it.
I never did an extra-large before.
No, the size is fine. Please don't think I'm criticizing, but green's just not his color.
-  What about, um--
- Brown!
Red.
Yes! Red!
Perfect!
Matches his cheeks...
And everything!
Whee!
Ah!
Hey!
- Oh. Well? 
- Coming closer now. Not just yet!
Two more degrees
north by northwest-- now!
Ohh!
Ahh!
- Season's greeting's back!
- Season's greetings!
Season's greetings!
Season's greetings!
Southeast crosswind, point right. Northwest-- are you nervous?
Me, nervous? No.
Oh!
You look...
Wonderful to me.
Uh, it does suit me, doesn't it?
A handsome man looks good in anything.
Oh, I'm so proud of you.
Mm!
It's time, sir.
Oh.
- They're waiting.
He looks wonderful!
It's a perfect fit, if I do say so myself.
The color, the style.. that outfit is him, boys. I'm telling you. Just him.
The prophecy...
Has come to pass...
That there would come to us...
A chosen one.
And that he, having
no child of his own,
would love all
children, everywhere.
And that he himself
would be...
An artisan, and a craftsman,
and a skilled...
Maker of toys.
And now, chosen one, come forward.
From this day on, now and forever, you will bring our gifts to all the children...
In all the world.
And all this
to be done...
On Christmas Eve.
How can I do so much in just one night?
Oh, yes.
Time travels with you; that the night of the world is a passage...
Of endless night for you.
Mm. Until your mission is done.
This is your legacy, and your gift, as is the gift of flight.
Mm-hmm. Now.
All those within the sound of my voice, and all those on this earth everywhere know...
That henceforth, you will be called...
Santa claus.
Santa?
And now, everyone,
-  merry Christmas!
- -Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas. Yes.
Come on.
Good boy.
Yo!
Faster! Faster!
Ho-ho-ho! Ha-ha-ha! Ho-ho-ho!
Come on, boys.
Come on!
Come on. Don't be afraid.
Come on.
This is it!
Come on!
Ho, ho, ho! Feel the wind in your faces, boys.
Oh, come on, donner.
There's nothing to worry about.
It's only flying.
"Only flying"?
What am I saying?
All right, boys.
Bank to the right.
Steady!
That's the way!
Come on, boys.
That's my good boys.
Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Oh, more and more are learning to write now, asking for what they want.
Reading and writing,
writing and reading.
Leave him alone! Don't!
Can't you see he hates it?
Let go! Leave him alone! Don't!
Leave him be!
You're hurting him.
Oh, l-let go!
Come back, you stupid animal!
Come back!
"I am sure he hurts the poor little kitten,
"and when I cry, he just laughs at me.
Yours sincerely, miss Sarah foster."
You were quite right to bring this to our attention, dooley.
That little boy must not get a present.
No present for him? Every child should get a present.
It's time to change the rules.
You'll have folks saying that Santa claus only rewards the good little boys and girls.
Isn't that as it should be?
All right. Dooley, make up a list...
Of who is naughty and nice.
Yes, sir!
And be careful.
I'll be checking it twice.

"'Twas the night
before Christmas,
"when all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse."
What is it? It's a poem.
A poem about me.
Ooh. They say it's a big hit.
"He had a broad face,
and a little round belly,
that shook when he laughed
like a bowlful of jelly."
What?
Pardon?
Was that-- that last part.
- "He had a broad face--
- Yes. Go on.
"And a little round belly,
- "that shook when he laughed like a bowlful of..
- Jelly.
It's just a poem.
- Is that how they think I look?
- Well, you know. The cookies.
It's the cookies.
The cookies.
Ohh.
Acid.
Your soup's getting cold.
Welcome back, Santa.
Have a good trip?
What's this?
Oh, next year's schedule.
Oh, can't it wait a few days?
He's just come home!
No!
Ooh.
I must have dozed off.
Darling,
why don't you get
an assistant, hmm?
- What? - I don't like to see you pushing yourself like this.
- You're spreading yourself too thin.
- Who would want the job?
Two elves spring to mind. One of them practically bounces to mind!
Oh, yes.
I'm supposed to show you this.
What is it? Oh, something patch thought up.
Look at that.
Isn't that a clever thing?

Cornelia! Come away
from that window this instant.
You can hear the music perfectly well at the table while you do your homework.
American history sitting around half-done--
if you think
that your step-Uncle...
- Is going to stand for this--
- He never even looks at my report card.
- He probably doesn't even know what grade I'm in. - Young lady, you do just as I tell you.
An assistant?
Your assistant?
Oh, w-w-with all due respect,
I have ideas that'll turn this place upside down.
That is not exactly what I had in mind.
No, no. I'm talking modern methods of production here!
I'm talking assembly line!
I'm talking wave of the future.
-  I'm talking faster, quicker--
- And sloppier.
Puffy, the thing about me is that I don't lack elf-assurance.
I'm not afraid to rock the sleigh!
Sir,
I have long admired your traditional methods of manufacture.
I assure you that I will give the same attention...
- To quality and detail--
- Boys, boys.
Don't give me campaign promises, give me results.
The one who gets the job is the one who does the job best.
How about this one?
Yeah.
There.
Clear!
- Go.
- Ha!
- Oh!
Excellent.
Keep up the good work.
Right. Right.
Wait! Isn't it going too fast?
Too fast?
Welcome to the 20th century!
Hey!
Good try, puffy.
Mmm, I can't eat another bite.
Me too.
Well, I'm taking my coffee
to the library, so I can watch my masterpiece theater.
And you, little miss, make sure you learn those Latin verbs!
♫
Psst! Psst!
Little boy?
Psst!
Hey, boy!
Going well, eh?
Merry Christmas, pretty lady.
Ho, ho, ho, ho!
What a night, my boys!
What a night!
Decorations hung at the windows.
Stockings hung
by the fireplaces.
Ho, ho, ho!
Isn't it wonderful!
Tonight, there's
not a child alive...
Who's not bursting with joy and happiness.
Oh.
Hang on, boys. I think we're gonna make an unscheduled stop.
Whoa!
All right, stay right here, boys. I'll be right back.
- Hello, son.
- Hey, beat it, man.
Find your own doorway.
Don't crowd me.
- What are you doing out here? - I'm pitchin' a no-hitter for the Yankees.
- What's it look like?
- But it's Christmas Eve!
Don't you know what that means?
Yeah, it means you don't have a job till next year. You and the rest of the winos.
- Don't you know who I am?
- Sure, you're a nut.
I'm Santa claus! Right.
And I'm the tooth fairy.
Well, I guess I'll just have to do it my way.
♫
Holy cow!
- How'd you do that?
- See, what did I tell ya?
Come on, Santa claus ain't... real?
Wanna go for a ride?
A ride?
A ride on that?
- I've never even been in a plane!
- You better make up your mind.
I'm pretty busy tonight. Yeah, sure, if it's all right.
- I mean, like, really?
Now, hold on tight, and don't worry.
You'll be as safe here as you are in your own home. I ain't got a home.
Mm-hmm.
Do you know how to say "yo"?
Yo?
Wow! Oh, wow!
You really are Santa claus, ain't ya?
Yes. But I still don't know who you are.
Joe! I'm Joe!
Nice to meet you, Joe.
Wow, neat!
How do you make 'me do it?
Oh, just like a horse and buggy.
Pull their reins.
Both together
to make 'em go higher.
Can they do anything you want?
Oh, yes.
- Well, anything except the super-dooper looper.
-  What's that?
- I've been trying for years.
Well, maybe tonight's the night!
Come on, donner. Let's give it that old college try!
- Come on, donner! This may be it! This may be it! 
- Ohh, yahoo!
You can do it, donner!
Come on, boy!
- Here we go!
- Ohh-- you can do it, boy!
I know you can do it!
-  Come on!
-  Ohh!
- Ohh.
Boy, well, didn't work again.
That's all right, donner boy.
We'll get it next time.
Tell 'em it's all right.
Uh, hey, like,
don't sweat it!
You did your best,
you know?
Hey, how would you like to drive for a while?
Me? Drive?
Sure!
It's easy.
Here! Take the reins.
Well, come on.
Whoa!
Wa-hoo-hoo!
Oh, wow!
How am I doin'?
Oh, great.
- Ohh!
-  Come on, guys, go!
Oh, no. No! Hey, wait a minute!
Come on, guys. Go!
Wait a minute! Oh!
Oh! Go, go, go!
Watch out! Oh!
Wait a minute!
Wait a second.
Oh, oh, my!
What do you call them?
Reindeer. No, I mean, what's their names?
Oh.
Startin' from the front,
that's
donner and blitzen.
Comet and cupid,
prancer and dancer,
then dasher and ViXen. Look.
There's the Brooklyn bridge.
Here we go! Come on, donner.
Come on!
-  Oh-h-h-h!
- Whoo! Whoo, whoo!
Go, go!
Let's go get it!
Come on, donner!
Come on, blitzen!
Go, guys, go, go!
- Come on, donner.
- You can do it.
Come on, go, go!
Oh, boy.
I better take 'em now, Joe.
Where are we going? Well, we can't joyride all night.
I've got a job to do, you know?
Oh, yeah!
Is this the kid who lives here?
Yep.
What'd he get?
Fishing rod.
How come?
That's what he asked for in his letter.
You mean, if a kid writes--
- anything he wants? - Joe, didn't you ever write me a letter?
I never believed in--
I mean, hey, I never needed nothin'.
- See, I usually travel light.
- Well-- let's travel now.
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't see it.
Are you him?
Are you Santa claus?
Boy, I hate it when this happens.
- Hello, little girl.
- Is this my doll?
Mmm.
- What are you doing here?
- You two know each other.
Oh, sort of.
I'm Cornelia.
I'm Joe.
- I'm Santa claus. - Oh, it's a great pleasure to meet you, sir.
Would you like some cookies?
They're from bloomingdale's.
Oh.
Chocolate chip.
They're my favorite.
Listen, corny. Thanks for all the good food you gave me.
I can make you a bowl of ice cream.
I tell you what, Joe. You stay here and have something to eat.
- I'll see you again.
- You will? You mean it?
Santa claus doesn't lie, Joe.
- Next Christmas Eve, we got a date, okay?
- You bet!
Thanks for the cookies.
What a guy.
Excellent.
Come on, now. It's easy.
There you go.
You're doing fine.
Thanks, daddy.
That's it. Oh!
Sweetie pie!
Mom!
- He's a great guy!
- His toys are cheap crap!
His presents suck! What do you care?
Nobody ever gave you nothin'!
How can you be so dumb?
Everyone knows he gives out shoddy, cheap toys.
My daddy says he's an old fake.
He is not. He's the nicest man in the whole world.
My parents gave me a doll, and she says whole sentences on a cassette.
You don't have any parents, so naaah! Ow!
- A fight! - Girls! No way can dancers be angry.
Returns are coming back
from everywhere.
Returns? We've
never had returns.
Maybe we could put out some kind of statement.
Hi.
Well, I've got a lot to do.
The thing--
I never was-- you see, I wanted- being tied down to a desk suits some elves, you know, but others of us are more free-spirited.
I know you had no idea.
I know that.
Patch, how can I say this?
Yeah, I think that,
um... red-- red just, just isn't my color, you know?
Congratulations!
He'll never have an assistant as good as me.
Let's face it, he just doesn't like me.
Well, boys, I'm gonna miss you.
You know that, don't you?
Take care of yourself, huh?
Now, sir, I'm asking you if this toy here was manufactured by your company,
the b.Z. Toy manufacturing
corporation.
Um, yes, senator, this doll appears to be...
One of our own Betty beauties.
Holy crap!
My goodness!
Well, what do you say to that, sir?
Well, senator, I've always known that cigarette smoking...
Could be hazardous to your health.
This is not a laughing matter, sir.
This is a tragedy!
You, sir, are a disgrace to your profession.
Um, senator, with all due respect-- and, I believe, this toy is advertised as being suitable for three-year-olds.
Oh, my goodness!
Um, senator, I'm even more astonished...
Than you are to see this, and I can guarantee that if these are not isolated examples,
I'll make sure that they never happen again.
Well, you better do
more than that, sir.
You better withdraw every b.Z. Toy on the market,
or I'll personally see to it that your license to manufacture in the United States is revoked.
No comment!
Okay, towser, give it to me straight.
The retail outfits are pulling our toys off the shelves. Cowards!
The post said that anyone who gives his kid a b.Z. Toy should have his head examined.
Swine!
Cancel my subscription.
We've got to meet a payroll by the end of the month for 2,000 factory workers.
Commies! And our cash flow is flowing the wrong way.
Right down the toilet. You sure know how to cheer a guy up.
What'll we do, b.Z.?
Patch gone? Where will he go?
What will he do?
The world is no place for an elf.
The world's a nice enough place, isn't it?
I mean, they send such nice letters from there. It must be.

Good morning, Mr. grizzard.
Everything okay?
Fine.
Greetings. Who the hell-- miss abruzzi!
Don't bother with that. I'll just vanish.
You'll what?
Vanish... like this.
Hello?
Hi.
Wha-- it's a bit uncomfortable in here. Oh!
Over here!
How did you do that?
Listen.
You make toys, right?
Are you, uh... from the federal trade commission?
No. I'm from the north pole.
I've got enough on my mind without having to deal with an escaped lunatic!
How do you know I escaped?
What are you?
Isn't it elf-explanatory?
How's that?
I'm an elf.
An elf?
Yes.
You mean, like a fairy?
No, I'm not a fairy.
I'm an elf.
But-but... why are you here?
Well, I gather you're a great toy giver.
I'm a great toy maker. We should get together. Why should I do that?
Heaven helps those who help their elf.
But-but-but why me?
Because I want to help you.
Why? So Santa claus will appreciate me.
I was right.
You are a lunatic.
Don't you believe in Santa claus?
Why should I? He never brought me anything.
That's because you were probably a naughty boy.
Yes... I guess
I was no angel.
Well, what did you have in mind, elf?
Just let me use your toy factory.
To make what?
Something special. Now, here's the idea. Mm-hmm.
First of all, you stop making all your regular toys.
Well, I'm sure they're fine and dandy, dandy and fine.
But we won't be needing them anymore.
Won't... be...
Needing them anymore?
No. Oh, uh, tell me something.
How can I tell all the people about my something special?
Advertise. Advertise?
How do I do that?
In my line, television works best.
Oh, I know! Those little picture box thingies? Can we get on those?
With enough money, a horse in a hoop skirt can get on one of those.
Money. I don't know much about that.
Good.
Oh.
Let's, um, keep it that way, huh?
Okay, but you'll fix it so I can get on the telly? Yeah. When?
Christmas Eve.
How long?
Is a minute all right?
What channel?
- Well, all of them.
- Which countries?
All of them. All the countries,
all the channels.
That would cost a fortune!
If you give extra kisses, you get bigger hugs.
- Sorry? - That's what Santa's wife is always saying.
Anyway...
That's all the advertising you'll ever need.
It better be. How many workers does this... product require?
Just me.
Wha-- no payroll?
A bowl of stew, heavy on the dill, a cold place to sleep.
What would it cost?
Cost? Cost who?
The people who buy the toy.
Well, nothing. We're going to give them away free.
Oh, that's fantastic! How do you turn your face so red so fast?
- For free? - Well, that's how we do it at the north pole.
Well, that's not how we do it here!
In a free enterprise
system-- on the other hand, this would go a long way...
Towards cleaning up my public image.
Excuse me? That's not a bad investment.
All that good p.R.
I'm intrigued. Excuse me.
You're drooling on your tie.
Yes, I know. I said I was intrigued, didn't I?
Now listen, son, what experience do you have in toy manufacture?
Come on. I'm entirely elf-taught.
Uh-huh.
What about it, b.Z.
This product of yours-- this, uh, something special-- what exactly is it?
It's something that's very easy to make. Uh-huh.
It's cheap.
Uh-huh.
It's simple.
Uh-huh.
You can turn them out by the thousands. Uh-huh.
And-- yes. And?
It's got a secret ingredient.
Look around you!
No strikes, no smelly workers!
No payroll!
It's practically paradise!
Still, giving this toy away for free-- that, Dr. towser, is why I am a captain of industry and you are an insignificant schlepper.
Sure, the first Christmas, it's free.
But the next one, we say,
"so you want it again?
Bigger? Better? Well, this time it's gonna cost you!"
How much? I don't know.
One hundred, two hundred.
Where will they get that kind of money?
What do I care?
Ahh, it's a wonderful thing, cracking your knuckles.
It's the pleasantest sound in the world.
What's he building in there?
I'm not sure. He says
it's the delivery system.
Yes? We brought the prototypes for, uh... it.
Let me see them.
Towser. Towser!
That one.
What color? What color do you like?
I like puce.
You would!
What's puce?
It's like fuchsia, but a shade less lavender and a bit more pink.
Sometimes
I wonder about you.
Fine. Puce, then. As long as it tastes good. But are you gonna-- if this catches on, we can come out with a liquid version.
Puce juice.
Oh, my!
An elf-portrait.
You haven't made one of those since-- it's for Joe. He never got a present in his life, and he's too proud to ask for one.
Mm-hmm.
He makes me think what our son might've been like, Anya.
Why, it's patch!
It's not patch-- well, I guess it does resemble-- my good old patch.
I don't know about this. It isn't what the north pole looks like at all.
Look, b.Z. Knows what he's doing.
He knows how to grab the people.
This isn't real. The public doesn't want reality. They want the dream.
Patch! Match!
Patch! Match!
♪ Someone new has come to town ♪
Patch! Patch! From the old north pole where the elves make toys, here's a Christmas treat for you girls and boys.
Oh, my name's patch.
As you can tell,
I'm an elf myself,
so let's give a yell.
Patch!
Well, the patch-work present
comes from me.
You'll find it under the Christmas tree.
And best of all, you will agree, is that it's absolutely free.
Cornelia, your step-Uncle has just dropped by for a minute.
Go in and wish him a merry Christmas.
Come in.
Merry Christmas, Uncle.
It certainly should be.
A little puce candy.
This special broadcast...
Is brought to you
by b.Z. Toys.
- At least he's all right.
- What are you going to do?
It's Christmas Eve,
isn't it?
I'm gonna do my job...
The way I always do.
Merry Christmas
from b.Z. Toys!
- Where is it?
- Up there, sir.
That's the stuff
I told you about.
Yes, it's terrific.
Well done, b.Z.!
Knock 'em dead, kid!
Knock 'em dead!
Come on, patch!
Give it all you got, kid!
Yaaaaa-hoo!
Oh! Oh.
Santa!
At least somebody down there likes me.
Easy, boys.
Easy, now.
Easy, boys.
Whoa!
- Hello, Joe.
- Hey, how's it goin'?
Not bad.
Yourself?
I'm okay, I guess. I was afraid you'd forget about me.
Well...
At least I've got one good friend left.
Are you kidding? I'm your pal for life! Honest!
Oh, hey, there was this weird guy on television. Some patch--
I know about that.
That's all right.
Then it's cool, then?
Yeah.
Hiya, blitzen. Hey, donner, how's it goin', man?
- Hey, comet!
- All right.
- Coming?
Neat!
Oh! I almost forgot.
- For me?
- For you.
A present?
Aw, gee, thanks!
Excellent!
Did corny get something?
The, um, little girl.
Oh! Are you seeing a lot of each other?
Actually, yes. Actually.
Well, of course she's gonna get a present.
She writes a nice letter.
She asked for a toy piano.
Well, come on.
Huh?
What about the, uh, "yo"?
Oh, right. Yo!
All right, donner!
All right, blitzen!
All right, everybody!
Ho-ho-ho!
Here we go! Ha-ha-ha!
Ho-ho-ho!
Don't you want to try it?
I certainly do not.
Well, it would be a shame to let it go to waste.
Do you mind if I take it?
I don't care.
Mmm!
Mmm!
Ohhh!
Oh, look at me!
I feel just like Mary poppins!
Okay, man, come on.
Do your worst, huh?
Come on. You can't get past me,
sucker. Come on! Come on!
Oh, yeah, you can't get past me.
Kid, come on, give me that ball!
Hey, what you doin'?
Hey!
Wow! I don't believe it!
You're cute.
Here he is, ladies and gentlemen.
The man of the hour.
Ask him anything.
Tell us how you make it.
Can you, please?
What's in the lollipops,
Mr. patch?
Well, it's-- all natural ingredients.
- No additives whatsoever.
- Who did your outfit?
Uh, goober, actually. He's head of the sewing department.
Mr. patch, has the space agency contacted you yet?
Who?
The astronauts.
Oh. No, they'll have to write to Santa claus...
Just like the other
boys and girls.
Uh, what we want-- what we want...
Is to bring joy and happiness...
To all the little children of this world.
And that's why
I'm proud to announce...
That, beginning today, my pal patch here...
Is exclusive with b.Z. Toys!
What about the fact that the senate subcommittee on toy safety...
Cited this company with 15 separate-- no more questions!
No more questions.
No more questions.
What's this about the senate subcommittee?
Just typical newspaper garbage.
Don't take it seriously. And what was that business about our future plans?
The future is ours, patch.
But I'm going back to the north pole.
Says who?
Well, nobody yet. But now Santa claus has seen what I can do.
I'm sure he's gonna send for me to come home.
Why would you want to do that? What does the north pole have that New York doesn't?
Ice and polar bears-- and Santa claus and my friends.
All right, all right.
I'll tell you what.
Just do me one favor before you go.
- No, I can't. I've gotta go back.
- No, no, no, no.
Not for me.
For them, patch.
- Well, who?
- Am I right?
Something...
Something for them.
Something for all the children...
Of this miserable old world.
So how about it?
Will you do it?
What is it? This stardust-- this reindeer cornflakes-- whatever it is that made the children walk on air-- wh-wh-what would happen if you were to juice up the formula a bit?
Just make it stronger?
Well, it's elf-explanatory.
I mean, it would make them fly.
Yeah, fly.
Fly? Fly? Fly?
You mean, like, fly?
Like fly high in the sky.
And could you do that before you go?
Yes, but I-- patch. It wouldn't take you long, would it?
Lollipops?
No, no!
No, we did that already.
That's yesterday's news.
The consumer needs a new model.
Well... candy canes?
Candy canes.
Mm-hmm.
Of course. Patch!
You are some terrific elf!
I mean, I could convert the--
I could convert the machines...
To do candy canes, and in a week or two, and then I suppose--
we can launch the ad campaign tomorrow.
Strike while the iron is hot!
I can promise delivery in, say, three months.
Three months?
But it's a year to Christmas.
When you've got a hit like we have, patch, the people don't want to wait a whole year; They're dying for a sequel!
A sequel.
That's it.
We'll bring it out on march 25, and we'll call it...
Christmas ii!
Christmas ii?
Maybe the whole idea is no good anymore.
What are you talking about?
What idea?
Christmas.
Claus!
The world is a different place now, Anya.
You don't see it.
The people don't seem to care...
About giving a gift...
Just so they can see the light of happiness in a friend's eyes.
Just--
just doesn't feel
like Christmas anymore.
Maybe this fellow b.Z.
Is smarter than I am.
Maybe I'm-- maybe I'm just an old fool.
Hi.
Hi. Come up, quick.
You're burning up!
I'll be all right.
You stay out there, and you'll be dead is what you'll be.
You're staying here!
I'm what? There's an empty room in the basement.
Nobody ever goes down there.
Oh, please, Joe.
Just till you get better.
Well... all right.
But just till I shake this.
It's, uh, a new doll.
A doll.
Children ought to like it.
Does it fly?
It, uh... wets.
Towser! Good lord, man!
3:00 in the morning!
Haven't you ever heard of the telephone?
I couldn't use the phone.
It's perfectly easy, towser. You just pick up the receiver and dial all the little numbers.
I didn't dare use the phone, b.Z.
I couldn't take the chance of anyone hearing. Hearing what?
Shhh!
Hearing what?
Are we alone? My niece and her nanny are fast asleep.
All right. Good.
Come on. Come on.
Here.
Ninety-nine.
You still have a temperature.
Four dopey points!
Big deal!
More liquids. That's what you need.
More vitamin c.
Come on. Let's go get some orange juice.
Oh, towser, with you it's
always some new melodrama.
Well, let me tell you, my friend, tonight, nothing can upset me.
The money's coming in so fast, you'd think we were printing it ourselves!
But, but, b.Z.-- do you realize what this means, man?
Santa claus is finished!
I'm taking over Christmas.
By next December, they'll be writing to me!
B.Z.
What the hell-- towser, take that way!
Oh! Oh!
Come on with me, young man!
Let me go!
How did you get in here? Who are you, anyway? Let me go!
Towser! Towser!
- You little brat!
- Who is this kid?
- Some damned little sneak!
- I heard what you said!
You ain't never gonna
beat Santa claus! Never!
I'll tell him, and he'll beat you!
 Park this kid on ice!
I'll deal with him later.
Shut up!
B.Z., we've got to talk.
Have you ever had one of those nights when you just want to drop a bomb?
Some damn kid in my basement, you waltzing into the house in the middle of the night-- by the way, towser, what the hell did you want, anyway?
It's the candy canes. They're dangerous.
What about 'em?
What the hell are you talking about?
This patch guy-- he told me he keeps that secret ingredient in cold storage...
Because it comes from the north pole.
 Uh-huh.
So we started manufacturing the candy canes. Uh-huh.
- It's a very powerful mixture, you know?
- Uh-huh.
So I just assumed I should refrigerate them too. Get on with your story!
Stop giving me all these short sentences and making me go "uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh"..
Like some kind of a moron!
Uh-huh.
I had to move one of the batches of candy canes to another part of the factory.
I left a box next
to a radiator in the lab.
- And?
- There's no more lab.
The candy canes
exploded!
They react to extreme heat
and turn volatile.
We've got to stop this.
 Stop? Are you insane?
We've got millions of dollars pouring in every day, most of it in cash.
Cash, man!
Small, unmarked bills.
B.Z., this stuff can kill people.
Are you going soft on me?
No, I'm not going-- listen, you idiot.
Who else knows about this?
Nobody.
What about patch?
He was asleep.
He didn't hear anything.
Don't tell him.
Don't tell anybody.
B.Z., these are children we're talking about.
Yes. And who appreciates them better than I?
These... industrious little boys and girls...
Saving all their
nickels and dimes...
To get the magic candy canes
I promised them.
They'll get
what they paid for.
If these people are so reckless as to have radiators in their houses-- reckless?
Towser, how does Brazil sound to you?
Brazil?
Brazil.
Sandy beaches, tropical breezes, big rum drinks with pineapple in them, senoritas in string bikinis, and-- oh, yes-- no extradition proceedings.
You mean-- you and me, Eric.
We'll take the cash...
And let the elf face the music.
Listen, kid. You wanna die on me when I'm gone?
Be my guest.
Dear Santa, you've gotta help.
Joe's been taken prisoner
by a very bad man.
I'm sorry to say
he's a relation of mine.
Cornelia, what are you doing? You're ten minutes late for breakfast.
I'm coming.
Just what I thought.
I think we should prepare the first shipments of pine wood as early as April this time.
Don't you agree, Santa?
What's this?
Looks like a letter.
In January?
A bit early for next
Christmas, isn't it?
It's familiar writing.
- Saddle up the reindeer! - But it's only two weeks since they've been out.
This can't wait.
Ah! Just the elves I want to see.
Hitch up the reindeer.
We're flying out at 1900 hours!
 That's what we came to tell you.
It's comet and cupid.
What about them?
- They've got flu.
This would have to happen now. Well,
I'll have to make do with six.
Get them ready.
Feed them.
Little Joe needs me.
But, boys...
We have got ourselves one heck of a problem here.
Our little friend Joe is in trouble.
If we don't help him, I don't even like to think of what can happen.
Now, listen.
I know we're two men short today.
But this time...
You've got to fly like the wind.
Can you do it for me?
Can you do it for little Joe?
Sure you can!
- All right, men.
Give me that extra effort.
I'm counting on you.
Yo!
Come on, blitzen!
Come on!
My gosh!
What are you doing down here?
As if you didn't know!
Me?
Yeah, you!
You ruined Christmas! But I never did.
What are you talking about?
He said that kids didn't like him no more!
You don't even know Santa claus.
Do so!
Do not!
He said I was his only friend left, you dumb punk!
But I-- I was just-- I just wanted him to see what a good assistant I could be.
He's seen what you are.
You're a dumb, stupid idiot, stink-face creep who made the kids hate the best guy ever!
Hey, what is this? Give me that!
It's mine!
Where did you get it?
He gave it to me.
See, I told you
I was his best friend.
My elf-portrait.
He does like me after all.
Huh?
Come on, kid.
Where are we going? We're going to the north pole.
We'll both go. And for once, we'll bring Santa claus a present.
It's you!
Thank heavens!
How is he?
I don't know.
Where is he? My step-Uncle's got him.
Those candy canes-- shhh.
Tell me on the way.
They exploded? That's what they said.
When they got hot.
I called the police, but
I don't think they believed me.
We've got to hurry.
Come on, boys!
Enough here to take care of all next year's
Christmas orders. Santa claus can take a year off.
His first vacation. Won't that be great?
Yeah, neat.
Oh, wow!
Yeah, good, huh?
- Ahhh!
- Put your seat belt on.
Hey, this is neat!
Yeah.
It's them! Both of them! Oh, no!
What is it? Look. The candy canes!
They're in the car with 'em.
Patch doesn't know they explode.
Fly, boys!
Fly like the wind!
Fly like you've never flown before!
Come on!
Okay, we know you're up there.
Now, come on down with your hands held high!
Unit 71, are you 10-4?
Let's go.
Open up! Police!
- We know you're in there!
- We'll kick the door!
-  We're comin' in! Hold it!
Whoa. Whoa!
Whooooaaaaah!
What the-- oh, this is neat!
I can do anything with this car I want. Watch.
- Fly, boys!
- Can't they go any faster?
They usually get a year's rest.
They're doing their best.
Fly!
Come on, boys!
Oh, wow!
Ohhh!
Come on!
That's it, boys!
Come on, now!
Come on!
That's the way.
That's the way. Come on.
That's my good boys.
Come on!
Yippee!
Oh, my gosh!
Joe! Joe!
Come on, boys!
That's patch in there!
If you love him like he loves you, give it all you got!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on, blitzen!
Come on, donner!
Can we go higher?
Of course, Joe.
Something's happening!
Patch! Oh, no!
Do something! The super-dooper looper.
It's the only way.
Come on, donner!
You can do it!
I know you can do it!
Come on! Faster!
Come on!
Faster!
What's going on?
Here we go! Hang on!
Here we go!
Give it all you got!
Come on, now! Come on!
Hah! Hah!
Come on, donner!
Come on! You can do it!
Santa! It's Santa!
Santa! Aah!
All right!
Santa!
Dash it away, donner!
Dash it away!
Joe!
Oh! Oh, my boys!
I've seen some reindeer in my time, but you're the best, the best!
We did it! We did it!
Ha-ha-ha!
Well done, donner!
Way to go, donner!
Patch, this is corny.
Corny, meet patch.
Hi, corny.
Nice to meet you, patch.
Yeah.
What about corny?
Can I stay? Just till next Christmas.
Please?
And you can give her a lift home next year.
Well, dooley? As if I don't have enough to do.
Now I'm going to have to be a school teacher.
School?
School?
Hey! What's going on?
Let-- let me down!

Their opponents, in the corner to my right... with a combined weight of 745 pounds... the toasts of the coasts... from Brad Street, U.S.A.,
Atlanta, Georgia... the Fabulous Freebirds!
Yeah!
You gotta love it!
Kill him!
Stomp on the son of--
Hey! Where you going?
Macleod.
Fasil. Wait.
Aah!
All right.
Macleod!
Clan Macleod!
May this year of our Lord 1536... bring victory to the Clan Macleod!
Macleod!
Victory to Macleod!
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Are you scared, Connor?
No, Cousin Dugal.
I'm not!
Don't talk nonsense, man.
I peed my kilt the first time
I went into battle.
Oh, aye.
Angus pees his kilt all the time!
Connor!
Connor, wait!
Wait!
Take these flowers and think of me.
Remember, you fight with God on your side, Connor.
A girl like that can wound a soldier... more than a Frazer sword, my friend.
Angus! You and Dugal keep him in one piece!
Aye, we all know what piece that is!
There is one called Connor among them.
Aye.
Remember our agreement, Murdoch.
The boy is mine.
It's begun.
Death to the Macleods!
Death to the Macleods!
Yay! Yay!
Death to the Frazers!
Yay! Yah!
Macleod!
Come on!
Macleod!
Now you stay under.
Forgive me... my son.
Fight me, damn you!
Fight me, cowards!
No, not him!
Castrate the heathens!
Nobody will fight me!
They all run away.
Here, laddie, stay by me.
Mother of God.
Fight me!
No!
Come on, quick!
There can be only one!
Another time, Macleod!
Get out of the car!
Put your hands on the hood!
Move!
Okay!
Watch it, freak!
Just cool it!
Watch him!
Watch him!
Move! Come on!
Come on! Move!
Come on!
Get up there!
Spread 'em!
Spread 'em!
Come on!
Let's see some I.D., pal.
Well, Mr. Nash.
Where were you going in such a hurry?
Give me it!
Give me it!
Ooh!
Don't move, pal.
Don't even breathe!
In nomine patri et filii et spiritu sancti.
Amen.
It is over.
No!
Other men are dying this day.
I must attend them.
Quiet!
He's a highlander, by God!
The last sound he hears... shouldn't be that of a wailing woman!
Hey, let me through.
Damn it, Frank.
Forensics is supposed to be notified... the same time as homicide.
Holy shit.
Yeah, this one came unassembled.
Did you make an arrest?
No. We're questioning some guy named Nash.
Antique dealer on Hudson Street.
- Hello, Brenda.
- Hey, Walt.
You look pretty, Brenda.
What do you think's... the cause of death,
Lieutenant, huh?
You're a barrel of laughs, Garfield.
Get your hands off!
Try explaining this to my wife!
Get me a cherry-cheese danish too.
What time did he buy it?
About 10:00, 10:30.
Whatever cut him was razor sharp.
Get out of here with these cameras!
Frank! Frank!
Oh, my God.
A guy was killed like this in Jersey.
What the hell.
That's Jersey.
I want out!
Hey, Frank. Come here.
Aw, shit!
Ooh, baby.
Look at you.
Garfield, cover that head.
What the hell have you got?
A Toledo-Salamanca.
A what?
A sword, Frank.
A very rare sword.
Is it worth much?
Only about a million bucks.
Any antique dealer on Hudson Street... could tell you that.
You can't keep me here!
I know my rights!
Ever see this guy before, Nash?
His name's Vazilek,
Polish national.
Had his head chopped off in New Jersey two nights ago.
You ever get over to New Jersey, Nash?
Not if I can help it.
You talk funny.
Where you from?
Lots of different places.
- You're an antique dealer, right?
- Mm-hmm.
Okay. What's that?
A sword?
Wise up, smart ass.
It's a Toledo-Salamanca broadsword worth about a million bucks.
So?
So you want to hear a theory?
You went down that garage to buy this sword from that guy--
- What's his name?
- I don't know. You tell me.
Okay, his name's lman Fasil.
You fought about the price and cut off his head.
Want to hear another theory?
This Fasil was so upset... about the lousy wrestling tonight... in a fit of depression, he cut off his own head.
That's not funny, Walt.
Are you a faggot, Nash?
Why? You cruising for a piece of ass?
I'll tell you what happened, Russell.
You went down to the garage for a blow job.
You just didn't want to pay for it.
Huh. You are sick.
Hey! Hey!
Hey, what are you doing?
Stop!
- What, are you crazy?
- Break it up, goddamn it!
That's enough!
Now, cut it out!
Goddamn it,
I said cut it out!
- Am I under arrest?
- Not yet.
Then we're through.
Nash, we're just getting started.
...in water from the sprinkler.
It also left a man's decapitated body... next to his own severed head.
A head which at this time has no name.
I know his name.
# Here I am #
# I'm the master of your destiny #
Ahh!
# I am the one
The only one #
# I am the god of kingdom come #
# Give me the prize #
# Just give me the prize ##
Okay, Mr. Victor Kruger.
Room 315.
And I'll hit you for 20 in advance.
Uh, hey, uh.
If there's anything you need--
Broads, uh, blow.
Just dial 0, huh?
That's right, Mr. Kruger.
Lucky Strike means fine tobacco.
Don't talk to the guests.
I didn't do nothing.
At last... the gathering.
Hi.
I'm Candy.
Of course you are.
Come on in.
Hiya. Got a present from the coroner.
Pieces of metal found on the dead guy under the Garden.
In the wound and on the clothes.
Real smooth shave.
That can't be right.
Son of a bitch.
Who's there?
Hey, Brenda. Usual?
Lots of it.
# ls better than a lifetime alone #
Say when.
# One sentimental moment in your arms #
When.
# Is like a shooting star... #
Excuse me a minute, Brenda.
Double Glenmoran on the rocks.
Glenmoran. Right.
Go to the Garden often?
What did you say?
# I'm a prisoner of love inside you #
# I'm falling apart all around you #
What did you say?
Madison...Square...Garden.
Do you go there often?
Why?
Basketball?
The circus? Wrestling?
Why are you asking me?
Have you been following me?
I'd like to walk you home, Brenda.
I can take care of myself.
# It's always a rainy day without you #
# I'm a prisoner of love inside you #
# I'm falling apart #
# All around you ##
Be quiet!
Unnhhrr!
Aah!
Here. Take this.
Nice to see you again, Macleod.
Nice to see you--
Stop!
There can be only one!
No!
You, on the ground.
This is the police.
Put down your weapons.
Hands on your head.
Another time, Highlander!
I will find you!
Hold it right there!
Come back here!
Stop!
Wait!
Who was that?
He called you Highlander.
"There can be only one"?
Only one what?
- I want to know!
- Shut up!
Don't you ever follow me again.
You only have one life.
If you value it... go home.
You saw the wound.
He should have died.
I say he's got the devil in him.
Drinking with us, are you?
What's the matter, Dugal?
You, talking and breathing... and last night, all but a corpse.
How did you manage that?
You'd rather I was dead?
It's not natural.
He's in league with Lucifer.
Don't say that, Kate.
I'll say it.
You've the devil in you.
We've been kinsmen 20 years.
Connor Macleod was my kinsman.
I don't know who you are.
Angus.
You better go, Connor.
I'm not going anywhere.
He's the devil!
Kill him!
Lucifer!
Burn the devil out of him!
All right.
Get him down.
Burn him!
Leave him be!
Dugal...
Oh!
He's your cousin, man!
No, Angus!
Quiet!
Quiet!
There'll be no burning here today!
We'll banish him!
No! Burn him!
Stop it, Kate!
Burn him!
Angus, burn him!
Can you walk?
I'll bloody well walk out of here.
Then go!
While there's still time.
I'll not forget you, Angus.
That's a good dog.
Pie and ale.
Do you want it?
Aye. Right now.
You filthy sod!
You're all muck and muscle.
Aye, blossom.
The way you like it.
You can do that to me forever, my lord.
Will you, Connor?
Aye, blossom. I will.
Greetings.
I am Juan Sanchez
Villa-Lobos Ramirez... chief metallurgist to King Charles V of Spain... and I'm at your service.
Who?
What do you want?
You.
You're Connor Macleod.
Maybe I am and--
You're Connor Macleod, wounded in battle... and driven from your village five years ago.
Connor!
Heather, go in the house.
I'll stay right here.
Do as I say, woman!
The sensation you're feeling is the quickening.
Who are you?
We are the same, Macleod!
We are brothers!
I knew you guys were bottle-fed.
Well, there's not a lot
I can do about it, pal.
See what I'm up against?
His Vietnamese neighbor ate his dog.
Uh... that's confidential.
How are things in forensics?
Dull. How about lunch?
Lunch? It's a good idea.
Who pays?
Me.
You're on.
By the way, Frank... the hairs in the Moretti case... matched up.
Oh, I forgot my purse.
I'll meet you outside.
Garfield, Brenda and I are going to lunch.
Sometimes, Macleod... the sharpest blade is not enough.
# B-A-L-A-N-C-E
Balance ##
I don't like boats!
I don't like water!
I'm a man, not a fish.
Oh, you complain endlessly.
You look like a woman, you stupid haggis.
Haggis? What is haggis?
Sheep's stomach stuffed with meat and barley.
And what do you do with it?
You eat it.
How revolting.
Be still.
You'll tip us over!
So?
I cannot swim, you Spanish peacock.
I'm not Spanish.
I'm Egyptian.
You said you were from Spain! Liar!
You have the manners of a goat... and you smell like dung.
And you have no knowledge whatsoever of your potential.
Now, get out!
No!
Help!
Help! Help!
Help!
Help me, I'm drowning!
You can't drown, you fool.
You're immortal!
I'm drowning!
Come help!
# We ask you...
Heavenly Father ##
I'm alive.
I can breathe.
I'll slice you in half.
Hah!
Crude and slow, clansman.
Your attack was no better than that of a clumsy child.
This cannot be.
It's the devil's work.
You cannot die, Macleod.
Accept it.
I hate you.
Good.
That is a perfect way to start.
Tell me... how did it happen, for God's sake?
Why does the sun come up, hmm?
Or are the stars just pinholes in the curtain of night?
Who knows?
What I do know is... because you were born different... men will fear you, try to drive you away...
Iike the people of your village.
You must learn to conceal your special gift... and harness your power... until the time of the gathering.
What gathering?
When only a few of us are left... we will feel an irresistible pull... towards a faraway land... to fight for the prize.
Come on!
Faster!
Never lose your temper.
If your head comes away from your neck... it's over.
Never overextend your thrust.
You're vulnerable and... off balance.
Connor! Ha ha ha!
Heather, please.
If it came down to us two, would you take my head?
We must fight until only one remains.
You are safe only on holy ground.
None of us will violate that law.
It's tradition.
Now for the last.
Trust me.
Let yourself feel the stag.
His heart... beating.
His blood...coursing.
Feel?
Come on!
I feel him.
Macleod, come on!
I feel him!
Come on!
Ha ha ha!
I feel him!
Come on, haggis!
Macleod.
This is the quickening.
Yeah!
Now, pendejo... shall we see what sort of swordsman you've become?
En garde!
Very good.
Give me your hand, brother.
That one there.
How much is it?
Put him in.
But what I want is a family.
You cannot have a family.
We cannot have children.
That won't please Heather.
I'll tell you that for nothing.
He's full of life.
Connor!
Here's dinner!
I'll be off now.
I fancy buying a new dress.
Oh, you little devils!
Go on!
She's beautiful.
You must leave her, brother.
Macleod.
I was born 2,437 years ago.
In that time,
I've had three wives.
The last was Shakiko, a Japanese princess.
Her father, Masamune, a genius... made this for me... in 593 B.C.
It is the only one of its kind...
Iike his daughter.
When Shakiko died,
I was shattered.
I would save you that pain.
Please.
Let Heather go.
When we first met, you felt ill, remember?
That wasn't the first time... you felt that sensation, was it?
No.
When the Macleods fought the Frazers... and a black knight...
I felt it then.
Only it was more painful.
That black knight was the Kurgan.
It's because of him that I sought you out.
Who is the Kurgan?
Where does he come from?
The Kurgans were an ancient people... from the steppes of Russia.
For amusement, they tossed children... into pits with hungry dogs to fight for meat.
The Kurgan.
He is the strongest of the immortals.
He is the perfect warrior.
If he wins the prize... mortal man would suffer an eternity of darkness.
How do you fight such a savage?
Hmm. With heart, faith, and steel.
In the end, there can be only one. very dangerous for you.
Well, I was very much in love... with her, my dear.
She was the only thing on my mind.
So, holding the rose in my teeth...
I climbed up on the rooftop, lowered a rope... and swung in through the open window.
Unfortunately, the lady was no longer there.
What did you do?
I introduced myself... to the lady that was there.
She was most helpful.
Would you like some more wine?
Yes, please.
Heather.
Get out!
What's wrong?
Get out!
Kurgan!
Ramirez!
Raah!
The Highlander, where is he?
You're too late.
I've prepared him for you.
You waste your time!
It hurts?
Now you die!
I am the strongest!
My cut has improved your voice.
Yes!
Hurts?
Who is the woman?
Oh! She's mine!
Not for much longer.
Tonight you sleep in hell!
There can be only one!
Hello, pretty.
I'd like to speak to Russell Nash.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Mr. Nash isn't here.
May I call him at home?
That won't be possible.
Good morning.
This is Brenda Wyatt,
Mr. Nash.
We've already met, Rachel.
What can I do for you?
I'd like some advice.
Are you someone who takes advice?
That depends.
Advice about what?
What can you tell me about a seven-foot lunatic... hacking away with a broadsword... at one in the morning,
New York City, 1985?
Not much.
A Japanese sword dated 600 B.C... the metal folded 200 times?
I don't deal in exotic weapons.
May I show you something in 18th-century silver?
That's not why I came.
You know it.
Do you cook?
Why?
I thought we might have dinner.
Did you?
Yes.
So I'm standing there, and there's Brenda.
Our little Brenda.
You're sure it was Brenda?
She was in Nash's shop talking to him.
What are you looking at, Rachel?
The eyes in the back of your head.
People are asking about you.
What am I supposed to say?
Tell them I'm immortal.
Quiet.
Don't be frightened.
- What's your name?
- Rachel.
- What happened?
- Everybody's dead.
I'm like you.
I'm alone.
Come with me, Rachel.
You're alive.
Why didn't you die?
Hey. It's a kind of magic.
- Move!
- Nein!
Heh heh heh.
Whatever you say, Jack.
You're the master race.
Let's go.
That was a long time ago.
Would you listen to me for one moment, please?
You can't hide your feelings from me.
I've known you too long.
What feelings?
How about loneliness?
I'm not lonely.
I've got everything
I need right here.
Oh, no, you don't.
You refuse to let anyone love you.
Love is for poets.
You're such a romantic, Rachel.
You always were.
Just a minute.
Good evening.
You want to dine in the hall... or shall we step inside?
Ohh.
Come in.
May I take your coat?
What? No, thanks.
I'll hold on to it.
Oh, fine.
Where are you going?
I forgot my earrings.
Make yourself a drink.
There are glasses in the bar.
You know what you're doing?
I like your place, Brenda.
I've been here three months.
Still fixing it up.
Interesting view.
What did you say?
I said, "lnteresting view"!
Isn't it great?
You never told me... what you do for a living.
I work for the Metropolitan Museum... in acquisitions.
Huh. That explains your interest... in ancient weapons.
Right.
Especially the samurai.
Very nice.
Shall we have a toast?
Yes.
Brandy.
Bottled in 1783.
Wow. That's old.
1783 was a very good year.
Mozart wrote his great mass.
The Montgolfier Brothers went up... in their first balloon.
And England recognized... the independence of the United States.
Is that right?
Yes.
What's that?
It's for you.
Can I open it?
If you like.
You bastard.
Where did you find this?
I have an extensive library.
Odd thing.
Your bio doesn't mention the Met.
It says you work for the police... in forensics.
Are you and Moran setting me up?
I don't work for Moran.
Then why is that bald policeman... sitting outside watching your apartment?
You remember him.
Moran's had him tailing me.
What are you going to do?
Question is, what are you going to do?
Turn off the tape or shoot me with the .45?
I'm not looking for a killer.
I'm looking for a sword.
The one used on Fasil.
- I only want to see the samurai.
- Why?
Because it's not supposed to exist.
I dated the blade at 600 B.C.
The metal had been folded 200 times.
The Japanese didn't make swords like that till the Middle Ages.
So where the hell did it come from?
If I could verify its existence... it would be like discovering a 747... a thousand years before the Wright Brothers ever flew.
This is crazy.
Wait a minute, Nash.
I want some answers.
You want?
Don't you ever think about anything... except what you want?
You must leave her, brother.
# There's no time for us #
# There's no place for us #
# What is this thing that fills our dreams #
# Yet slips away from us? #
# Who wants to live forever? #
# Who wants to live forever? #
# There's no chance for us #
# It's all decided for us #
# This world has only one sweet moment #
# Set aside for us #
Heather!
# Who wants to live forever? #
# Who wants to live forever? #
Heather!
Connor, I'm here!
# Who dares to love forever #
# When love must die? ##
My beautiful man.
My husband.
I am that, my love.
I've never really known...
What?
Why you stayed.
Because I love you as much now... as the first day we met.
And I love you.
I don't want to die.
I want to stay with you forever.
I want that too.
Will you do something for me, Connor?
What, lass?
In the years to come, will you light a candle... and remember me on my birthday?
Aye, love. I will.
I wanted to have your children.
They would have been strong and fine.
Don't see me, Connor.
Let me die in peace.
Where are we?
We're in the highlands.
Where else?
Running down a mountainside.
The sun is shining.
It's not cold.
You've got your sheepskins on... and the boots
I made for you.
Good night, my bonny Heather.
Hey! Kastagir.
Macleod, it's good to see you again.
It seems like 100 years.
It's been 100 years.
How have you been?
Hey, this... puts hairs on your chest.
What is it?
Boom-boom.
Big strong man like you... shouldn't be afraid of a little boom-boom.
Maybe you think
I'm trying to poison you.
I think you're crazy, Kastagir.
So... the gathering is here.
Time's almost caught us, friend.
Has it? Do you think we should go on?
I think we should have a party.
Oh, no. I remember our last party.
Really?
When exactly was that?
It was 1783.
Oh, yes.
Your famous duel on Boston Common.
You were drunk.
What was that guy's name again?
His name was Bassett.
The heavier blade, Mr. Bassett.
I implore you.
I am fighting this duel,
Hotchkiss, not you.
See if the imbecile is ready.
Mr. Bassett is waiting, sir.
Tell him I'm ready.
Christ! I've gone blind.
En garde, sir.
Wonderful, sir.
Thank you, Hotchkiss.
Bassett?
That you?
You missed him, Mr. Bassett.
The sword, the sword.
Stop, sir.
I beseech you.
I apologize for calling your wife... a bloated warthog--
And I bid you good day.
Shoot him, sir.
Shoot him.
Now, sir, in the back!
Now, sir!
Hotchkiss. Hotchkiss!
Stop it!
# Hotchkiss #
What?
No, sir.
No, no...
No! No! No!
That's the mood of New York now.
Get out of here!
So far...
Earlier today, in response to growing pressure... the mayor's office issued the following statement...
Give us a drink, pal.
Got a joint?
...vigorous investigation... following up on some promising leads.
Hey, Rockefeller, how'd you like Candy?
She said you were kind of kinky, huh?
Don't ever speak to me.
I didn't mean nothin'.
Look, I didn't mean--
Don't ever speak to me again.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
Good.
I hope you get your head chopped off, asshole.
And you!
Shut it!
# Here we stand #
# And here we fall #
# History won't care at all #
# Lay on the bed #
# Put out the light #
# ...won't be home tonight, yeah #
# We don't waste no time at all... #
- Hey, big boy.
- Slow down.
# Comes to you... #
# Ahh, we just waited for another... ##
What the hell?
Okay, marine, this is for real!
Yah!
Let's go!
Go, go, go, go!
Come on, come on!
What the hell is going on?
Ahh!
Is somebody trapped in there?
For God's sake!
Ooo!
Look at that!
Mother of God.
Mom.
Hey, where are you going with my car?
Daddy, help me! Daddy!
Daddy, help me!
Help, Daddy!
Daddy, help me!
Frank, take it easy.
I checked everywhere.
There aren't any witnesses.
That's New York for you.
Twenty people standing around.
Nobody saw a thing.
Tell me about Matunas.
Is he on drugs?
He's a survival nut.
What?
He was a marine.
His ex-c.o. said he was paranoid... but he was a good man.
How you doing, kid?
Okay, for a guy who got three feet of steel crammed through his gut.
How you doing?
I understand you saw who stuck you?
You kidding me, man?
Is that him?
Nope.
Quit kidding, Matunas.
It was dark in that alley.
The freak was trying to kill me!
He had a scar across his neck.
That ain't him.
Shit.
Depressed?
Yeah.
You don't know grunt about depressed.
I got me a .357.
Got me a trunk load of shotguns.
I got three big-bore battle rifles... ammo up the ass... and I ain't safe!
I can't protect myself!
Okay, take it easy, pal.
That weirdo, man.
He got up after I put enough lead in him... to drop a rhino.
Hey, listen, could you work... with one of our artists?
Get a picture of this guy?
Sure, sure.
Thanks.
Take it easy, pal.
Hey, cop.
Yeah.
I know you guys think I'm nuts... but there's something else
I gotta tell you.
After he threw me against the wall--
This is like
"One Step Beyond".
All we got is an eyewitness.
Don't say anything about sword fights... or guys glowing in the dark for Christ's sake.
Hey, Moran!
Have you read this?
Are you kidding?
You know cops can't read.
What does "incompetent" mean?
That mayor.
He calls me at 2:00 in the morning.
I don't answer the phone anymore.
What does "baffled" mean?
Karen Joan Nash.
Yeah, I remember her.
I was practicing in Syracuse.
Didn't get many of these.
What?
Unwed mothers.
Nowadays, that's no big deal.
Back then, in Syracuse... that was a stoning offense.
What happened?
She had the baby, and she died.
So Nash was illegitimate.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, he was illegitimate... for about a minute and a half.
He died right after she did.
He died.
Hello, Brenda.
I did what you asked.
I went through the deeds to Nash's house... back through five previous owners... to the original guy,
Montague, in 1796.
In all five instances...
Montague through Nash...
I found a death certificate... for a kid with the same name... who died at birth... years before he pretended to sign for his inheritance.
Jesus, Rick, isn't there any heat in here?
No. Heat's bad for the circuits.
In case there's any doubt...
So, what you've got here, Brenda... is a guy who's been creeping around... since at least 1700... pretending to croak every so often.
Leaving all his goods... to kids who've been corpses for years... and assuming their identities.
It's not possible.
"Post" final!
Cops release headhunter picture!
Reward offered.
I'll take a "Post."
Headhunter revealed!
For you, my bonny Heather.
Happy birthday.
And you, Juan Ramirez.
Take care of her, you overdressed haggis.
Kastagir is gone.
Only you and I remain.
Nice to see you, Kurgan.
Who cuts your hair?
I am in disguise.
This way no one will recognize me.
I do.
What do you want?
Your head.
And the prize.
Watch.
Happy Halloween, ladies!
Nuns. No sense of humor.
Ramirez's blade did not cut deeply enough.
He was right about you.
You're slime.
Ramirez was an effete snob!
He died on his knees!
I took his head and raped his woman... before his blood was even cold!
I see.
Ramirez lied.
She was not his woman.
She was your woman... and she never told you.
I wonder why.
Perhaps I gave her something... you never could... and secretly she yearned for my return.
Holy ground, Highlander!
Remember what
Ramirez taught you.
You can't stay in here forever.
You are weak, Highlander.
You will always be weaker than I.
I'll be out front.
Goodbye, Macleod.
We will meet soon enough.
This is the house of God.
People are trying to pray.
You're disturbing them.
He cares about these helpless mortals?
Of course he cares.
He died for our sins.
That shall be his undoing.
Father... forgive me!
I am a worm.
I have something to say!
It's better to burn out... than to fade away!
Yah!
I need to see him, goddamn it!
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Mr. Nash is--
Mr. Nash is dead.
What are you doing here?
I'm looking for a dead guy named Nash.
He died at birth in Syracuse, New York.
All right.
Come on.
Are the Claymores real?
What is this, a museum?
This stuff must be worth a fortune.
I've been alive for 4 1/2 centuries.
I cannot die.
Huh.
Well, everybody's got their problems.
What are you going to do with that?
Take it.
I am Connor Macleod of the Clan Macleod.
I was born in 1518... in the village of Glenfinnan... on the shores of Loch Shiel... and I am immortal.
You're not listening.
Brenda, it isn't going to work.
I can't get involved.
Not again.
You know what's weird?
Most people are afraid to die.
That's not your problem.
You're afraid to live.
Take care of yourself.
Don't lose your head.
Hello, pretty.
Come on!
Open up!
Oh, my!
Have you ever played chicken?
Here we go!
Watch out!
Excuse me!
Oh, no!
Watch out! A truck!
Look out!
# New York, New York #

Your friend is a real screamer.
Listen.
Which part should
I cut off first?
I'll be waiting.
The endless killing has driven him mad.
Rachel, there are instructions in the desk drawer.
I want you to follow them.
There's a power of attorney for you.
You'll have everything you need.
You're not coming back.
Even if you kill him... you're not coming back... are you?
Sweet Rachel.
You always knew this would happen.
Russell Nash dies tonight.
Hey... it's a kind of magic.
Goodbye, Russell Nash.
So now it ends.
Yah!
What kept you?
There can be only one!
The quickening overpowers me!
I know!
I know everything!
I am everything! this is where it all began.
Can you tell me about the prize?
It's like a whirlwind in my head.
But if I concentrate...
I know what people are thinking... all over the world.
Presidents... diplomats... scientists.
I can help them understand each other.
What am I thinking?
You're thinking... whether or not you can love me.
You can.
I'm just like you.
I can love and have children.
Live and grow old.
You never prepared me for that... you Spanish peacock.
Patience, Highlander.
You have done well.
But it'll take time.
You are generations being born and dying.
You are at one with all living things.
Each man's thoughts and dreams are yours to know.
You have power beyond imagination.
Use it well, my friend.
Don't lose your head.

Now remember what you've been taught.
Bring him home with love.
Have a safe journey, my child.
Woman: Arrivederci.
Second woman:
Bonne chance, ma belle.

Oh...
Just a little. Thank you.
Now, what it comes down to grace, is basics.
If your stepson applies himself, he can climb that success ladder just as quickly as I did.
See, there is no stopping a man who is determined.
Isn't that right, Ben?
Oh, right. Ed was so right.
Man: Wow.
Woman: Whoo! Hi there, Patty.
Hi.
Oh, Patty, Patty, oh, I'm so happy for you and... I'm sorry.

Have you set the date yet?
Yes. Look at this girl.
Such a face.
I feel horrible about this foul weather ruining your engagement party.
Oh, well, it just brings us all closer together, don't you think?
Will you excuse me?
I seem to have lost my fiance.
Oh, Patty, get a good hold on that one.
He's quite a catch.
Yes. I'd be afraid someone would steal him away.
Like to see them try.
Woman: Ah!
Hi. Congratulations.
Oh, thank you.
From what my daughter tells me, your son has the makings of a great salesman.
Now, that is long-term security for the boy, not this musician stuff.
Ah, here she comes, daddy's little star.
Oh, have I showed you the artwork for our new campaign?
Wait till you see this.
This is just something.
Oh, look at her.
Ohh... Ohh...
Here. Hold this up, Ben, so everybody can see my little, ethereal beauty.
So damn proud.
First, she becomes the face for our new cosmetic line, and then my one and my only one gonna become a bride.
Mm.
Boy better treat my little princess right, Ben...
Or else.
It's my little Patty cat here.
Ok. Enough.
Have you seen Jim?
I can't seem to find him anywhere.
Sure. Last time I saw him, old Al cirimele was chewing his ear off in the kitchen.
All is the best sales rep we've got, and Jim is gonna be on his team.
Will you all excuse me, please?
Hello, Patricia.
Mr. Winston, sir.
Aldridge, what are you doing here?
I know this isn't the time to talk business, sir, but gleason said you did want to know the marketing results of the ethereal beauty line.
Oh, yes. I certainly do.
Well...
Pretty bad...
Sir.
Honey...
In case no one told you, the party has moved inside due to the bad weather.
That's funny.
Nobody said a word to me.
Think I should be offended?
This is embarrassing.
Everybody is gonna think that I'm marrying a man who doesn't have enough sense to come in out of the rain.
Maybe everybody doesn't know what they're missing.
This is called a romantic interlude.
Come out and interlude with me?
Um...
You're making me mad, and I'm going in.
No. Wait!
Sanders on first base.
Looks like he's going for second, and there he goes!
Sanders has stolen second base...
And Sanders looks like he's gonna go for third, but wait.
The play is to third base.
It looks bad for Sanders.
It's a pickle.
He's caught between second and third base.
There's the base, there's the toss, and Sanders is safe at third.
You coming in or not?
Is Sanders coming in or not?
That seems to be the question of the evening.
There's the pitch.
It's a perfect bunt down the first-base line.
His fans are cheering him in.
"Go! Go! Go!"
They're going crazy.
They're on their feet.
They're at the window.
Uh!
Heh heh. Hi.
We'll be in in one second, ok?
I hope you have some way of explaining this to them because I don't.
We could tell them I start spring training tomorrow.
No. Hmm...
You ok? You still have that headache.
No. No. I'm fine.
Come on, slugger.
I'll dry you off and get you some more aspirin, but, Jim... I know. I know.
I know. What?
No more fun tonight.
Come on, honey.
Aah!
All right. Listen up, you scum.
Shut off that crap!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Ha! Smooth move, man.
All right. You've got something we want.
If we get it, nobody gets hurt.
Ed: What the hell is this?
You want a free demonstration?
All right. We want a hostage.
Take that guy. Get him.
Woman: Oh, dear God.
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
Patty: Aah! All right. Mmph!
Man: Shut up, or I'll grease your friends here.
Mmph! Mmph! Come on.
Come here.
You want to see your friend alive again, cooperate when we call.
Ben, do something.
Nobody move, nobody gets hurt.
I change my mind. Catch!
Pin!
Let's get the hell out of here.
What'd you do? Don't ask.
Just go. Go, go!
Aah! Aah!
Ed: It's all right. It's all right.
Don't panic.
I'll get it.
It's probably them.
Yes?
Man: Good evening, sir.
Can you tell me what sound a rubber grenade makes?
Sorry. Time's up.
The correct answer is pbbt!
Ow! Ha ha ha! Whoo!
Ooh! Ha ha ha!
Come on, Georgie. Go, man.
Beautiful.
Jerks! Hey!
This is the worst thing you ever done, George.
Worst? Why, I oughta...
For a nonprofit scam, this was all-time.
All-time?
Do you have any idea what you've done?
He's hot. He's hot. Cool him off.
Cool him off.
Fire!
Just wait till you see the real party we have going back at casa hymie.
No. No. Yes.
Not at my place, not the party ninjas.
It's your bachelor party.
Surprise! Surprise! Surprise!
Come on, Sanders.
How's about a little appreciation up here?
I'll give you some appreciation, George.
Hey! Hey!
Aah!
Hmm...
Ohh...
Somebody! Anybody! Help!
Blanket.
Uh-huh.
Miss?
Miss? Hey, huh?
Oh, come on.
A phone. Phone. Phone.
Where's the phone?
Great.
Wow.
Hi.
Oh. I'm sorry. I...
I didn't mean to be too- can I get you something to... how about something for your... oh, boy.
Uh, maybe I should... oh! Aah!
Ohh...
Ohh...
Oh, it's broken.
Don't worry.
We'll get somebody to look at it.
I promise. I'll take care of everything.
I'll just call a doctor or a...
Veterinarian.
Oh, no, no. No. I'm sorry.
I mean, I'm... Married.
Um, not married.
I'm engaged, which is... you know, it's, uh, just as bad.
I mean, I'm dreaming.
I mean, I must be dreaming, and if I'm dreaming, then there's nothing to feel guilty about, right?
So, go ahead.
Knock yourself out.
Coming. Oh!
I don't believe this.
I know. I know. I overslept.
Hope you had pleasant dreams.
Well, as a matter of fact...
Jim, this isn't funny.
Daddy is furious over last night.
Honey, I thought I explained everything when I called.
Yeah. You also said that you would be over first thing in the morning with an apology for him.
You're absolutely right.
I'm sorry. Sorry.
All right. Well, I should at least call him and tell him that you... uh, no, no, no.
Actually, the place is a little messy from last night.
Actually, more than a bit.
I don't think you want to see this.
Ok. All right.
So, we'll see you in half an hour.
Ok. Ok, and, Jim, please, don't be late.
There's some sort of problem going on at the company, and daddy is in a real poo-poo mood.
Ok. I promise I'll hurry.
Ok. All right.
Thanks, guys.
Thanks a bunch.
Patty: Move it, jerks!
Ha ha ha!
You guys don't think she was just a tad angry with us, do you?
Nah. Nah.
Oh, my God, you're real.
Ouch.
Jim, this is your wake-up call.
Continental breakfast.
This, um... Jim!
Wait a minute. St-stay there.
Stay there. No, no, no.
Don't move. Don't go anywhere.
Come on, Sanders! Hide.
Hide, ok? Hide.
Just hide. Hide.
George: Open up... Now!
Jim Bob! Come on, Sanders!
Maybe he's on the throne.
Hi. Hi.
Hi. Hey.
What's going on?
You tell us.
I was just leaving.
I'm gonna go meet up with Patty.
Yeah. We just saw her.
Great gal, not even remotely upset about last night.
Oh, yeah? Terrific.
Well, listen, guys.
I'm in a bit of a hurry, so do me a favor.
Why don't you walk me out, ok?
Come on.
Well, we came over to help you clean up.
Is this open? No.
No. That's all right.
I got everything, anyway.
Oh, ok. Well, gee, we really wanted to help you, Jim.
Maybe we can come back later.
No!
No! Wait, guys!
Where is it? Where's what?
I don't know. What?
Holmes, the bedroom.
Bravo, Watson.
The game is afoot.
I don't get it.
Neither do I.
I mean, what did you jerks expect to find, huh?
You think that, um... ha ha ha! Yes!
No, no, no, no. It's not what you think it is, George.
Welcome home.
It's really, really important that you listen to me right now, ok?
Our little stud souffle went on a love frenzy last night.
It's not what you... will you stop it?
George, please, it's really important you listen to me right now, ok?
You're about to see something that is simply gonna amaze you.
We know that's not
Patty, right, guys?
George, please.
I don't know whether I should go for the year's supply of canned ham or what's behind curtain number 3.
George, I'm begging you.
It's important.
Curtain number 3. Canned ham.
Bob, I'm going for the curtain.
Yeah! Open that curtain! No!
Who is she?
I guess that's an angel.
Angel who?
Aah!
Just an angel.
Have not got time for this.
We got to get back there.
We never should've left her alone.
You'll feel better after we get you something to eat.
Rex, decoy.
George: Big Jim, eat, eat.
You need all your strength for the scam that...
Hi.
So, how you doing?
Fine. Yeah?
I'm excited, guys. This doesn't happen every day.
This is big, don.
Grab those peanut butter cookies for Rex.
Now listen. What do we know about trademark and copyrights?
I'll call Wertheimer.
Wertheimer? Wertheimer?
He went to law school.
The thing about this, guys, is, we have to move rapid, quick.
Once that wing heals, she's gone.
I just want to make sure we don't get ripped off.
Ripped off? We own an angel, guys.
We do not own an angel.
Revenue deluxe... motion pictures, concert appearances...
I'm thinking out loud here... radio, record albums, television, miniseries, man...
"angel, the ninth wonder of the world."
I'm not gonna turn her into some kind of sideshow freak.
I didn't even think about sideshows.
Jim... Look. She's hurt, ok?
She's got to be cared for.
We got to find somebody... hey, what's up? You're supposed to be on decoy.
Yeah, well, she's on the phone lining up a couple of hot ones for us tonight.
I can't believe I'm wasting time with you maniacs.
I got to get back. I never should've left her alone in the first place.
George, pay for this stuff.
If your family needs money... no!
Ever since the second grade, we've done everything you wanted to because up until now, we haven't hurt anybody.
Think about it, George.
She's an angel.
She doesn't belong in a circus, so if you don't want to help me, then fine. No problem.
I'll take care of it myself.
See you later.
Ok. All right. Don't worry.
All this is gonna do is make you heal faster.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You ok?
Cold, huh? Don't worry.
Just wrap this around you like that.
See? All better, huh?
Is that better?
No. Ahem. No.
Can't do that, see?
Oh, no. Patty's father.
No.
I should just go over, don't you think?
I thought so.
Just what I need... another headache.
I'll be back with Patty as soon as I can, and then we'll figure out what to do with you.
You, uh, keep warm and don't let anybody see you.
No, no, no, no.
I'll be back very soon.
You'll be safe here, I promise.
There's nothing to worry about.
Aah!
Patty. Oh, listen.
I was just on my way over to explain about this... so, this is why you didn't want me coming in before, huh?
Patty, listen. It's not what you think it is.
She's not as girl.
She's an angel.
Oh, God, Jim.
It's true. I swear to God.
At least your friends were honest with me.
What did they tell you?
Obviously, the truth.
Patty, wait.
You know they hate you.
I mean... what?
Get back inside.
Go on!
Oh, man, don't break anything else.
Why me?
Well...
This must be the place.
Um...
Yeeeow!
Ok. You stay here, ok?
Man: Yes?
Excuse me. Could I talk to you for a minute?
Go around.
It's just take a second.
Other side, son. Ok.
Be right back,
I promise you, ok?
Now, what are your sins?
Now, there's no reason to be afraid.
Tell me, when was your last confession?
Confession of what?
Are you a catholic, son?
No. No, sir. I've never been here before.
I just didn't know where to take her.
Take who?
The angel I found. Hmm.
So anyways, so I brought her here figuring maybe you folks would know what to do with her.
I can't take care of her, and I don't want to see her exploited, so what should I do?
Oh, say 10 hail Marys and 8 our fathers and make a good act of contrition.
Wait. What do you mean? I don't know what those things are.
Well, that's not my problem.
Go in peace.
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
¡Dios mio! ¡Santa Maria!
Hey, hey.
Hey, come here.
It's me. Come on.
Oh, it's ok. It's all right.
Everything is fine.
Now, what's going on here?
Oh, sir, this is her.
See, she's the angel.
Now, whatever you kids are up to, a church is no place for your pranks.
Now, you'll have to leave. No.
Listen. Let me take this off and show you what she really looks like.
If you don't leave, I'm gonna have to call the police.
But where am I gonna take her?
Try the baptists.
Honey, I'm sure she's just one of those girls left over from that party they had.
Lounging around in his blanket until 5:00 the next afternoon.
No. It is over between us.
No! Don't say that! Ow!
Oh! Ohh! I'm sorry.
Oh, honey...
We're gonna keep calling Jim until we get to the bottom of this.
Oh, mm...
I'm sure the tea will help those.
This always happens when I get upset. Oh...
Ben! Where's that tea?
Ben: Here we are, ladies.
Sorry it took so long.
You'll love these shortbread cookies, Patty.
I used twice the butter.
Just put it down over there.
Patty doesn't care at the moment about twice the butter, thanks to your son.
Have you called again?
Yes, grace.
He's still not home.
Patty, I know Jim would never delib...
I'll never forgive him if he ruins this for us.
Honey, does you daddy know about all this yet?
Mm-hmm.
What did he say?
He said he was gonna tear
Jim's head off and shove it... maybe I better try
Jim's place again.
Ohh... Aww...
Come on. Try it. Please?
Don't be scared. There's nothing to be afraid of.
I mean, everybody likes hamburgers.
Look. You can't get better unless you eat something.
You got to try it.
You'll love this.
Like this. Watch.
See? Big bite.
Hmm? Uh-huh. It's good, hmm?
Mm-mm-mm!
It's good.
Tastes great. You try.
Yeah. It's good. Mm-hmm.
Oh, no, on.
Woman: What is that?
Hey. Shh, shh, shh.
Shh, no, no, no, no, no. Wait. Look.
It's just a hamburger. There's nothing to be frightened of.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's not gonna bite you.
If you don't want... if you don't... uh... I've got to call Patty.
Stay there.
¶ Why don't you stay for a while ¶
¶ well, it's up to you, 'cause ¶
¶ you are the girl ¶
¶ who keeps me up at night ¶
¶ you are the girl ¶
¶ who makes me feel all right ¶
¶ You are the girl in my dreams ¶
George, we've been down this road twice.
So where else do we look?
Sherlock.
Man: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Turn! Back it up, back it up.
George, it's her!
Come on back. Come on.
Come on. Pull in there. Quick!
Oh, wow. Hello there.
Remember me?
Grace, if Patty's there, could
I please just talk to her?
That... that's not true.
You just don't under... don't give me that.
If you really cared, you wouldn't be having this lewd affair.
Here. These are 2-ply.
Madam, your carriage awaits you on track number 7.
First stop, Broadway.
Second stop's along the way at Hollywood.
Right this way. Come on.
Higher tax bracket. Come on.
Never fear, Mr. French fry is here. Ok.
Hey, no sign of Jim, but he's gotta be around.
Mmrgh.
- She likes them.
- Men:
Man: Really. Here you go.
Man: Yeah. Yeah. Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Out of this car, into that car.
Get the door.
Get the door, Rex.
Man: Ok. Get the door.
- Give her that look.
- She's.
Give her that look. The look.
Hey. How you doin'?
Ok, forget the look.
Forget the look.
Make with the fries again.
I know how it appears, but I promise you, if you let me talk for 2 seconds,
I... I know I can straighten this whole thing out.
He wants to talk to you for 2 seconds.
Ok.
Drop dead!
That was 2 seconds.
Man: Come on. Come on.
¶ Every time I wonder ¶
¶ if the world is right... ¶ hey!
What? Aah!
What are you trying to do?
Well, I'm trying to make us rich, Jim.
Come on. Give us the angel.
Jim: Give this up, George.
Bite his hand! Aah!
Come on. No way.
No way are you gonna take her.
What'd you weasels tell Patty?
Rex: A pack of lies.
Don: Hey, you wanna compose, you need bucks!
Rex: Yeah, unless you wanna keep driving that dung heap the rest of your life.
George: Hey, you can write the angelic symphony in d minor.
Get out of here!
Think about it, tchaikov.
See ya later, hon.
Get out of here, George.
Don't worry. I'll get it fixed.
Just haven't gotten around to it yet.
Uhh!
Aah.
What happened to all the fries?
Serves you right.
Ok.
Home, sweet home.
I call it quits for tonight, all right?
Tomorrow, first thing, we're gonna make sure... gets to look at you.
Oh, no, he got out again.
Come on, hurry, hurry, come on.
No, brutus, no.
Run! Bad dog.
Bad dog. Bad dog. Stop!
Bad dog.
Bad doggie. Bad dog.
Get away from him.
That dog is a killer.
Don't... don't egg him... don't... don't...
Wow.
That's great.
You're incredible.
Mr. Winston: Is she?
Oh, um...
Mr. Winston.
What a surprise.
Oh, um, I think I should take this moment to tell you how deeply sorry I am that I didn't make it over this afternoon to personally apologize about, you know, last night, but the most incredible thing has happened to me.
You see, s-s-she...
Shut up.
I'm going to enlighten you, young man.
Uhh! Now, you and this floozy of yours here...
Hi. I'm Eddie Winston.
It's an honor to meet you.
Uh, um, Mr. Winston, this is, um... Her.
You see, she was hurt, and
I wanted to help her.
You see, Patty totally misunderstood when she came over...
Say no more, Jim.
I completely understand.
Why don't you two just have a good time?
I'll explain to pattycat and take care of everything.
You don't worry about a thing.
I-I don't think that would be a very good idea.
You, you just take good care of this lovely lady.
You promise me that?
I promise.
Great.
Ok, now you two just have a wonderful time.
I-I just think you make a wonderful couple and I'll just take care of everything, ok?
Good night, Jim.
Jim: Good night, sir.
Good night, miss.
I hope I do get to see you again.
Golly.
Ah. I feel really good!
Wait a minute.
Wait!
Good boy. Good dog.
Stay.
Sit!
Stop!
Aaah!
Owwwaah!
Had enough!
Ha. Hello.
Is something the matter?
I mean...
Don't you sleep?
Uh, no, I... do you remember the girl?
The girl... Patty?
Well, we're gonna get married.
I mean, it's not like I don't wanna go with you, but... look, tomorrow, I promise.
We'll figure everything out, ok?
I mean, we'll find out where you belong and who you are.
Ok?
Woman: Winston's cosmetics.
Man: Well, I heard...
Second man: Yeah, I heard they may go under.
I'll transfer you. Thank you.
Winston's cosmetics.
Aldridge, we all know the test results on the ethereal line, and I for one don't want to hear them anymore.
The question that we are here to answer is what was at fault?
Why did it fail?
Who are we gonna blame?
Uh... The advertising campaign was poorly conceived, sir?
I agree.
Right. We can teller and gillette and we start again. Agreed?
Uh, Mr. Winston, excuse me, but isn't the situation far more crucial than just changing ad agencies?
I mean, doesn't the whole future of Winston's cosmetics depend on... now, that is not true!
I want these rumors squashed.
This company is in perfectly capable... oh!
Excuse me.
I don't know if you all know, but
I was attacked last night.
We're sorry to hear that, sir.
It was worth it.
For what I discovered...
I found a face to die for.
A complexion that every female on earth would sell her soul for.
I'm telling you, this girl is the ethereal beauty.
With her, we could go international.
She is everything we could ever hope for.
That sounds great, Mr. Winston.
We're behind you 200%, sir.
Yeah. Who is this girl?
My daughter's fiance's mistress.
Are you sure we can get her, sir?
Oh, we'll get her.
I will definitely get her.
Uh, what about your daughter, sir?
This is business, aldridge.
Ed Winston's daughter will understand.
Get out!
I don't want to hear any more.
Now, wait, wait, wait. Now, just think about the good...
Aah! Look, once I get this girl working and out of the way, you and Jim are gonna be free to get back together.
I'll give you a tremendous wedding.
Aah! Just leave me alone!
I hate you.
Oh, you don't care about me.
Who defended you when you were having affairs on my mother, who lied for you!
Nothing better to do with your stupid pension.
All right, now, pattycat, let's not hurt each other here.
Uhh!
Aah!
Well, that's just unavoidable, isn't it?
Oh! How am I gonna face anyone now?
Do you hear that?
I'm hiccuping now!
Here. Put this on.
Take it.
That's right.
Ok.
All right. Good going.
It's ok. One after the other one.
Sorry.
Man: All right, boys. That's the last of the paperwork.
Copyright and trademark.
That's all you need.
Show me what you got.
You're going to want to sit down for this.
This stuff is great.
...wash over you. Just let it open your mind.
Open your mind. At the beach.
Ok, look at this, look at this.
Official angel halo.
See? Angel cola. Angel cola.
Everyone drinks cola.
The official "I love the angel" bumper sticker.
Yeah! A buck apiece.
We'll sell millions of them.
An-gel. An-gel.
Do you get it, man? Gel.
Whoa!
Shh.
Look here. Hey.
Look. See?
This mean anything to you?
Come on. See?
Company picnic? Senior class?
Take these off. Here.
Oh, shh, wait, don't.
Shh.
Shh.
Woman: Shh.
Bad back.
Old surfing injury.
Jim: Good.
Yeah, keep your hands to your side.
You just... step... wonderful. No problem.
Don't worry. When Patty sees what you are, she's... she's gonna love you.
Hi, honey!
Patty?
Just... wait.
Patty, please. Please, sweetheart, don't... just don't overreact. Let me... please let me explain, ok?
I... you can't...
Patty?
Ok, honey? You know what?
If you don't believe me, see for yourself.
They say seeing is believing.
Well, you're not gonna believe this.
You're not gonna believe this, sweetheart. You're... aw, come on. Give me a break.
Patty, come on. Shut off the...
Patricia, these are not the actions of a person involved in a relationship based upon commitment.
Patty! Come on.
Ohh...
Man on TV: Please.
You've got it all wrong.
She means nothing to me. Nothing.
Woman on TV: Nothing. Ha!
I don't hear from you for 3 days, tad.
You didn't even call... Yeah.
Patty! Oh, thank God.
Look, please, please, don't hang up the phone.
Just listen to me.
I know you're furious, but.
I-I-I found her in my pool.
I-I mean...
I-I fell asleep and I woke up and there was this noise and I went outside...
Uhh. Ohh.
Woman on TV: Oh, you.
Oh! Aah!
Come on.
Ow!
George: Look.
Yes, of course, sir.
I mean, if I heard, you know, if I heard this, I would think it was crazy, too, but I swear this is on the level.
So you... oh, oh, wow.
So you're coming. Thank you.
That's tomorrow at the press club at noon.
And just come as you are, you know.
Just dress casually.
We'll be there. Ok.
Great. Bye-bye.
Don, that was the "daily news."
That's the end of the list, man.
They're all coming.
Uh, how about all the TV stations?
All the TV stations. All the radio stations.
Tabloids. The works.
Ain't got the angel.
Now what are we gonna do about Sanders?
Don't worry about that.
I've got everything taken care of.
Do you know what Jim's problem's always been?
He never thinks about himself.
That's why God created us.
I think when this whole thing's over, he's gonna come running up here and plant a big, wet, juicy one right there on my cheek and say,
"George, thank you."
I wouldn't count on it.
I've never seen him this stubborn.
George: Let's face it.
Jim is a screwed-up little puppy right now.
Why do you think he's been having these headaches, acting like a space cadet?
He knows marrying Patty and that stupid job's not what he's supposed to be doing with his life.
This angel's the best thing that could've happened to him.
So, how are we gonna get her, ace?
Ha. Once again, the talented and lovely miss Patty Winston will assist us.
What?
How?
Even as we speak, it's in the works, gentlemen.
Genius, this abduction.
Sheer genius.
Miss Patty Winston?
Yes. Whew. These are for you.
Who the hell are you?
I'm the love bug.
Hey, your boyfriend really cares about you.
You have a good time tonight, and remember, love to live and live to love.
¶ I'm the love bug ¶
¶ and once you're bitten, hey ¶
¶ you want a love hug ¶
¶ 'cause you'll be smitten ¶ ha!
¶ 'Cause I'm ¶ oh,
God, that was good.
Hey, did you see my sign?
Patty? What do you want, George?
I'm embarrassed, and I apologize.
We want to help.
Oh, really.
We thought maybe you'd come by at 8:00 and drink some beer.
Just the guys.
No, I'm not leaving her alone.
Ah. Well, bring her along.
We'll go someplace else.
Like where?
Pfft. The park?
The park? Why?
Just for old times' sake?
Ok, fine, George.
Just one thing, all right?
No screwing around. I mean it.
Come on. Trust me, Sanders.
Sure. See you.
"Trust me, Sanders." As far as I can throw you.
Oh, no.
I got worried.
I thought you were gone.
I'm sorry if I interrupted you.
Your... Whatever.
Phone home?
We've gotta go meet the guys.
We, uh...
Better get you dressed.
Jim: Well, I don't see them.
Of course, that doesn't mean anything.
George is always late.
What?
What? Patty. Patty!
What are you doing here?
I don't know.
I am so stupid.
Jim: Patty, wait.
Please don't leave. Just... no, no, no, please.
Just stay here.
I gotta talk to her.
Patty, don't leave!
She be ours now, lads.
¶ I've been so lonely ¶
¶ she can't understand the way I feel ¶
Patty, listen, don't leave.
Go. Your angel is waiting.
Listen to me. Leave me alone.
God, you really love making a fool out of me.
Would you hear me out?
Man: Aah!
If you want to break it off with...
Listen to me.
I am not leaving you!
This isn't happening to me!
George: Hang on.
Get her in. Quick.
Get her feet in. Come on.
George: Come on!
Get her turned around.
Hurry up. Here he comes!
Be careful. She's shedding!
Man: Aah!
Aah!
Rex: Hurry. Come on!
Jim: George.
Don't do it, George!
Don't do it! George!
No!... George: Sorry, Jim Bob, but this is for your own good.
Guys, let her go.
George, waaait!
Georrrge!
Aaaaah!
¶ I still remember summer ¶
¶ way back when we both felt the same ¶
¶ and I still love her ¶
¶ I can't stop thinking of her ¶
¶ I'm having trouble understanding Jane ¶
George?
Man: Hey. Hey, look, look.
It's my favorite. See? Fun?
Bubble bear. Look. Watch.
Don, try the French fries again.
Right.
Look at this. Mm, French fries.
Yeah.
Rex: Remember those?
French fries.
All right. Mm. Easy.
You can have some French fries.
Aah!
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
¶ I'm having trouble understanding Jane ¶
¶ yes, I'm having trouble understanding Jane ¶
¶ Understanding Jane ¶
Ah. You guys, check it out.
Can we discuss these outfits you rented for us?
Rex.
You love Hawaiian.
I love Hawaiian shirts, Rex.
I look like a flashback.
But you look great!
You really look... come on!
Check it out.
There's so many people.
Everybody came.
Man: Typical.
Man: Oh, my God.
Man: Is that... is that the guy from channel 5?
Man: Ok. Sliding off. What?
Maybe we should just forget he whole thing.
Man: Guys.
Come on, you guys. I told you.
You gotta watch out for that stare.
Shh, it's ok. It's ok. Yeah.
Now come on, you guys.
It's showtime.
Um, yeah? Hello?
No. He's not here.
Sure. I'll tell him.
You can't make it.
Press club. Ok. Press club.
Sure. Yeah. I'll tell him.
Thank you. Thanks for calling.
Hmm...
Press club.
Good morning.
Oh, hey, I guess it's afternoon already, huh?
Ha ha ha!
Was that supposed to be funny?
I've called this press conference to present to the world the greatest find of this century.
Where is it?
Got to be around here somewhere.
Hey! Ho! Watch out, man!
What's the matter with you?
Look. I'm sorry about that.
I'm in a bit of a hurry. Do you know where the press club is?
Press club? Press club...
Yeah. You go down 53... no.
Press club...
Well, go down 127... no.
The press club...
The old press club?
That's the community building.
Commun... great. Ok.
Forget it. Good.
Oh, my!
Dang fool!
And now we present to you our discovery in the interest of theological, scientific, and economic phenomenon.
Why are we still here?
This is a joke.
I'm curious what the punch line is.
George, I'm gonna kill you.
Gentlemen, bring her out, please.
I think this is way out of line.
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, this is the real, honest-to-God angel.
Aah!
We can see that.
Attagirl. Don't let them treat you like that.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
We had to keep her disguised.
I'll show you why.
She's a fake.
These guys are trying to con you.
She's no angel.
Sorry, people.
You've wasted you time.
No. You haven't wasted your time. Look.
Jim, take it easy. Agh!
No, no, no! It was
George's idea.
I said no. I said,
"bad, George, bad."
It's ok. It's over.
George: Jim, come on, man.
Come on, Jimmy.
I'm trying to work here.
We're seconds away from history, Jim.
I'm trying to make a buck. Come on.
Wow!
Man: Wait, wait, wait.
Come back.
George: Go get her.
That's the news story of the century getting away.
Go on. Do your job.
Take pictures.
No. Stop. Stop. No, no. No, no.
Um, excuse me.
What was that all about?
Hold on. Hold on.
Could we talk to her, then?
No. Why not?
Because she's mine.
So, what have we learned here today?
Our 3 young impresarios still swear to the validity of their angel and claim they'll get her back.
I guess you could say that one man's angel is another man's girl.
This is Harlan rafferty reporting from...
Aah! Aah!
I don't find this amusing!
Now, this is the last time I am going to ask.
Where is she?
We're telling you the truth.
He could have taken her out of state for all we know.
I don't think so.
The police would have found them by now.
The cops are after them?
Why? What for? What did they do?
It seems your friend Jim stole some valuables from my house the night of the party.
That is a big load.
So was that terrorist stunt.
I'm gonna tell you something.
I could press charges, and I could have you punks fined, and I could have you jailed.
Jail? Please.
Anything but that.
Ha ha ha!
Hey, I'd like to see you try and prove it was us.
Would you?
Yeah.
Just say the word, pisshead.
Pisshead.
Yeah. Pretty effective word... "pisshead."
Now what?
Cheer up, Capone.
I'll get us out of here.
We'll find the angel.
Yeah? What if
Winston gets there first?
We're toast.
Uh-huh, and here's another one for you, babe.
Who's bailing us out?
Jim! Ha ha ha!
That's a good question.
One thing's for sure... nobody's gonna find you here.
Be careful.
That's why I think you should love it.
I know I did.
I mean, that is, of course, if I could find it.
It's been so long.
I just hope it's still here.
It's somewhere around here.
There you go.
Very good. You found it.
Your very own high-rise penthouse.
Have you seen this guy?
Yeah. He looks familiar.
Yeah. That's the crazy fool that liked to break my station the other day.
What day?
Tuesday. Tuesday?
Yeah. Or I think it was Wednesday.
Tuesday or Wednesday.
Tuesday.
I see you have a new friend.
Something to do.
We got all kinds of good stuff here.
We've got stuff to clean ourselves up with.
Wait a minute.
You're hungry, right?
Eat this. See? That's good for you.
Like that?
You want this? That's what you want, huh?
This right there. There you go.
No. Uh... um... One at a time, all right?
Take it easy.
One at a time.
Man: ¶ ...A river ¶
¶ rolling into nowhere... ¶ if you can think of any place in the world where he might be hiding with this girl, we'd all appreciate knowing.
Man: ¶ the finer things keep shining through ¶
¶ the way my soul gets lost in you ¶
¶ The finer things
I feel in me ¶
No more!
Now you listen.
This has never accomplished anything.
Now... now stop this violence!
This is not violence, daddy.
When I find that little slut,
I'll show you some violence!
Man: ¶ w go so fast ¶
¶ why don't we make it last? ¶
¶ please take my hand... ¶ hey, what word rhymes with throbbing?
Man: ¶ ...With me ¶
¶ come see ¶
¶ with me ¶
¶ whoa, come see ¶
¶ while there is time ¶
¶ let's go out and feel everything ¶
¶ if you hold me ¶
¶ I will let you into my dreams ¶
¶ but time is a river ¶
¶ running into nowhere ¶
¶ we must live while we can ¶
¶ and we'll drink our cup of laughter ¶ have a nice day.
Hi.
Yeah. Um, have you seen this guy?
He's really cute.
Have you seen him?
Yeah. Um, I'll show you.
Right there.
That's him, right?
Yeah, that's him.
That's him.
Wait a minute. Are you gonna...
Hi.
You know, my father got me into music.
After that, the only thing I wanted
- was to be a...
- Great composer.
The only problem was, everything I composed was always more grating than great.
But I kept at it, and then the last 6 months or so,
I don't know.
Everything started feeling so... the headaches got so bad, I just stopped composing altogether and went back to screwing around with the guys, you know... just took some odd jobs.
And then I... then I met Patty.
She never liked the idea of me being a composer anyway, and somehow I thought being married and having a steady job and all that would just straighten things out in my head.
And now here you are.
I'm so damn confused,
I don't know what to think.
You know, I really care about Patty.
She's... she's... ok, so she's not you, but please, if you can't look at me without that stupid look of affection on your face, then don't look at me at all, because I've got enough problems, you know?
I'm only human.
I'm sorry. Sorry.
I know... I know it's not your fault.
But it's crazy to feel this way about you.
Don't you see? We could never have a real life together because you don't belong here.
And it's not that I don't feel something, and it's not that I don't care, but...
I mean, who wouldn't fall in love with you?
Man: Whose dumb idea was this?
Woman: Just keep on looking.
Hey, wait. Stop the car.
For what?
Just stop the car.
What am I stopping the car for?
What... what are you doing?
Man: What is it? You got to go to the bathroom or what?
Woman: Come here.
Bingo.
Want to hear something?
I found this in my glove compartment.
You like it?
Um, believe it or not, this is one of the first things
I ever composed and conducted in college.
I... I was never too crazy about this section here, you know.
I always thought I should put some more strings in because...
It's not really dance music.
It's...
Dance music.
I just wish you could tell me how you feel.
Yeah. Me, too.
Hello.
No, he's not.
Sure, I'll take a message.
Where was his car found?
Where's that?
Oh, yeah.
Thank you. I'll make sure that he gets the message. Yeah.
Thank you very much, detective.
This is it. This is it!
Oh, she's gonna be so sorry.
She's messed with the wrong girl.
Nobody makes a fool of me.
What am I doing?
Ok. I'm Patty.
I hate that blouse!
Yes. Perfect.
Ok.
She is dead. She's dead.
She's going to be one sorry slut.
Oh!
My hat. My hat.
My hat.
So want to play tough?
I can play plenty tough, sister.
Whoa!
Oh!
Ha ha ha!
Ben: Sorry I didn't get you out sooner, but you know grace.
George: We understand, and we'll pay you back, I promise.
You boys are the only ones that can help me.
We've got to get to Jim and the girl before Winston does.
Wait. You know where they are?
I've got a pretty good idea.
Thank goodness the police aren't searching the woods till morning.
All: The tree house!
I'm embarrassed.
I think this is gonna work.
You tell me if this hurts, ok?
Just let me know.
Ok. Now go ahead. Extend them.
There it is.
According to the book, all your powers should be restored.
That means you can... you can leave.
I mean, it makes sense anyway, doesn't it?
We can't stay here forever.
They're gonna find us eventually.
When they do, they'll turn you into a freak show.
I'm sorry. I just don't think I could take that.
I think it's better that you just go back to where you belong.
I've got to go back, too.
Right now, Patty must be...
Yeah, I know.
It's all the more reason for you to leave.
I'm afraid down here, those are a common occurrence.
Well, it's not gonna get any easier.
Come on. I'll walk you to the meadow.
Ugh.
Woman: ¶ I do ¶
¶ angel baby ¶
¶ my angel baby ¶
¶ when you are near me ¶ aaah! Aaah!
Stop it!
Nope. Gone.
What do you think?
I think she's flown the Coop.
Let's keep looking.
Patty: Aah!
Grr!
Oh, no.
Jim: Come on now.
Don't play around.
Look, I'm not feeling too swift, and I want to get back.
Don't do this to me.
Look, you know how
I feel about you.
It's just that...
Patty?
Hi.
How did you find me?
You look awful.
Thank you.
What happened to you?
I regained my feminine dignity.
Now, where's that angel bitch, hmm?
I guess she's gone.
I'm sorry.
I really wanted you to meet her.
Liar!
Oops.
I suppose I deserved that for hurting you.
Mmm.
But the angel is gone.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I don't think so.
Uh!
You bastard!
How dare you hit me!
I didn't. I swear I didn't.
Oh, you are gonna regret that move, mister.
Where's my rifle?
Oh, no, no, no. Patty, come on.
You can't be serious.
Go to hell!
Aah!
Oh, boy.
Ok. Come on.
Come on. You got to show yourself.
You kicked me in my heinie.
Where are you?
Look, there's no need for this.
Don't do this.
Nobody ever kicks me in my heinie.
Ah.
You hear? Nobody!
What?
He did what?
Patty: He hit me, daddy.
And then he kicked me in my heinie.
Your heinie?
Oh, honey.
I didn't do it.
I swear I didn't.
It was her.
I was nowhere near her.
I didn't even touch her.
She did it.
Where is she?
She's gone, but she's here.
I mean, I can't find her.
She kicked... she disappeared.
You know, I read in a book that a healthy angel...
You better give us some answers, young man, and I mean the truth!
Nobody has to get hurt here.
You just tell me where she is, and we'll forget the whole affair.
What? Just a minute.
I've got some say here.
Look, just settle down!
This is business, right, wimp?
It's just between us men.
George: That's right, my friend.
Just between us men, no?
Unhand that wimp!
Pisshead!
Jim: My heroes.
That's my dad. You're in trouble now, Eddie.
Hiya, pa.
What have you done to my son?
Hey!
Don't start something that you can't finish.
Kick his butt, Ben!
All: Kick his butt, Ben! Kick his butt, Ben!
Kick his butt, Ben!
Shut up!
Kick her butt, then!
All: Kick her butt, then!
Kick her butt, then!
Let him go. I'm not gonna ask you again.
Just as soon as he tells me where she is, you can have the punk.
Now, where is she?! I want her!
Did you have garlic for lunch?
Agh!
Hey, hey! Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Spread out! Spread out!
Aah! Aah!
Jim.
Jim Bob. Jim?
Boys, we'd better get him to a hospital.
Don, get his feet.
Come on, buddy.
Wake up. Get up.
I'm sorry, but it's not good.
Your son has a cerebral tumor in a very advanced stage.
Hasn't he been complaining of severe headaches?
Hi.
Listen, I'm sorry that I yelled at you.
I didn't really want you to go.
I'm going to die, huh?
That's why you're here.
You were supposed to take me that first night... the night of the party, only you broke your wing and messed up your mission, huh?
Does everybody get you when they go?
Good. I might be jealous.
I'm scared.
I guess that's kind of natural, isn't it?
I'm sorry we didn't have more time together.
There's so much I wanted to share with you.
I love you.
Jim?
We didn't realize that, um...
If we'd have, uh, you know...
We were just trying to make...
George.
Happy.
He's already... woman: No, he isn't, and you know you shouldn't be in here.
But we have to tell him something.
You can do that tomorrow.
Now he needs his rest.
Well, we thought that he might not...
Don't worry. Jim's gonna be around for quite a while.
I have that on the highest authority.
Now if you don't mind,
I need to be alone with my patient.
So how do you feel?
Fine.
Wait a minute.
How?
An answer to an angel's prayer.
Do you like it?
Look at that.
I got a leave of absence for good behavior.
I guess he thought we could make some good music together.
Jim, I'm starving.
Do you feel well enough to take me out for some French fries?

In just about a quarter of an hour's time, ex-police officer David Steed is to be submitted to the supreme test.
This will make the fourth time the state has tried to execute him.
He's been sentenced to death for the murder of his friend, colleague and superior officer, Sergeant Willy Dunlop.
Never before in the history of this country has a man survived three attempts to execute him.
First time was the gas chamber.
But Dave breathed in the cyanide like it was pure, pollution-free mountain air.
The second attempt by the state to have Dave meet his maker was by hanging, but when Dave dropped, you guessed it, the rope broke.
Then it was the firing squad.
But inexplicably, not one single bullet even scratched Dave.
Now he's gonna get the chair.
I'd like to see the son of a bitch get out of that!
Now he's gonna fry!
Yeah?
Oh.
It's for you, boss.
Hello Rosy.
It's all arranged.
Don't worry, nothing can go wrong this time.
All right, I'll talk to you later.
You ask my husband, he knows all about these things.
Right Leopold?
Leopold hardly says a word these days, he's so depressed.
He's against the death penalty.
How about you, sir?
How do you feel?
I'm sure glad I'm not in his place.
I know he ain't feeling too good.
Sorry lady, no visitors today.
But I have an invitation signed by the governor.
Hey, I don't care if it was signed by the president, the warden said not let in any complimentary passes.
But don't you recognize me?
I'm Rosy Labouche!
The condemned man and I were close.
Real close.
Lady, if you were the condemned man himself
I couldn't let you in.
Well could you at least see that he receives these flowers?
Perhaps they could arrange them in front of the electric chair, so he could see them?
I want David to be thinking of me when they throw the switch.
I'll see what I can do.
Oh, you are so kind!
Thank you so much.
Hi Jackson.
Dave, that's the 14th plate of beans you've eaten!
Would you like something to drink?
You know, regulations say you can have champagne if you want it.
Champagne?
Gives me gas.
Well can I get you something else?
Yeah, more beans.
More beans?
Uh huh.
Could you make it a zookie beans this time?
Zookie beans?
I never heard of them, but I guess I can get the cook to rustle some up.
Great, I'll have
'em for lunch.
Lunch?
Hey man, they're coming for you now.
By the time lunchtime rolls around, you're gonna be having dinner with honky number one.
You may go.
There's no need to make your confessions, my son.
What Earthly sins could you have committed since we last took this walk together the day before yesterday?
Well, how about gluttony, Father?
I absolve you.
Now come along, my son.
[Speed] When all this first began,
I never dreamt it would end this way.
I had just come out of the police academy and received my first solo assignment.
It seems like only yesterday.
As you know, red plutonium will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere and will plunge and plummet with pinpoint precision to a pre-determined place on the Earth's surface.
The purpose of red plutonium's mission is to test the top-secret device, detecting minerals below the moon's crust.
Now gentlemen, the site selected for this momentous experiment is namely Creektown, or as the Indians call it, Poboke.
Whose inhabitants, by the way, have proved themselves to be patriotic, true blue Americans, and are here to share with us this historic moment.
[Speed] Sergeant Dunlop had ordered me to proceed to Creektown to collect the fine for non-payment of a parking ticket.
Even though the village was in the middle of a swamp and I had to leave my wheels on dry ground,
I was hell-bent on carrying out my mission no matter what.
This is headquarters calling Officer Speed.
Headquarters calling
Officer Speed.
Come in, Officer Speed.
This is Sergeant Dunlop calling Officer Speed.
Officer Speed, do you read me?
Over.
Oh that was good thinking, Sergeant.
Sending him across the Glades to Creektown on the very day.
NASA's having their top-secret experiments out there.
(chuckling) That's really smart.
Well how was I to know that, Chief?
I mean, you yourself just said it was top-secret!
What would have happened to the population of Creektown had the citizens not been evacuated in time?
Well, probably nothing.
The explosion of red plutonium will bombard the Earth's surface with a barrage of harmless red amoeba rays, which will have the effect of floroscoping whatever lies underground.
Mr. Jim Polaka?
Mr. Jim Polaka?
Hello?
Anybody home?
This is Officer Speed calling headquarters.
Hey, Sergeant Dunlop.
It's Dave!
It's him!
He's coming through our short wave!
We can hear him, but he can't hear us.
It's a freak reception.
Speed!
Speed, you dumb rookie!
Get back here right away!
You're gonna get yourself killed!
Get back to headquarters, do you hear me?
This is urgent!
Hey, it's really peaceful out here.
You know what, Sarge?
I'm gonna enter his domicile and tack the ticket to his totem pole.
All systems.
Assignment completed, over and out.
Hey fella.
Hey fella.
Could you move over?
Scat!
Scat!
Git, git!
Oh, that poor kid.
He wasn't much of a rookie in his class, but he did die in the line of duty, trying to collect on a traffic violation.
That poor kid.
Little late to be feeling sorry, isn't it?
I'll tell you what.
If it scares you that much,
I've got just the job to take it off your mind,
Officer Dunlop.
Come on, Sergeant!
The Sarge!
Hey, Sarge!
I could hardly believe it.
I got the cover back into place just by thinking about it.
But then I realized something incredible, something extraordinary had happened to me.
To start with, we'll forget all that baloney you told the Chief.
As far as I'm concerned, you never went to that creek.
But I did go, Sarge.
Then how come you never noticed all that hell that was breaking loose around you?
I did.
It was this huge explosion.
Louder than I can do with my bubble.
Your what?
Listen, don't give me that bubble stuff!
Not even an ant could have survived in that explosion!
Why are you getting so mad?
Sounds like you're sorry I'm still alive.
Well what do you expect?
If a man gets caught in the middle of an atomic blast, the least he could do is drop dead!
But I told you, Sarge.
Everything turned bright red, there was this roaring sound, next thing I knew, I came to under a mountain of sand.
A mountain of sand.
That's a good one.
That's a revolting habit, and it's against regulations!
And what's more, it turns my stomach!
What does?
Chewing gum.
Any turkey that chews gum and blows bubbles is really at the top of my list, boy.
Right there you gotta put it?
Oh, you dope.
Sorry Sarge.
I mean, no offense.
I'm one of Rosy
Labouche's greatest fans.
I've seen all of her movies.
Even the silent ones.
What do you mean, even the silent ones?
She's young enough to make that Cheryl Ladd and Farrah Fawcett look like a couple of plain Janes.
You're really crazy about her, eh Sarge?
Sure I'm crazy about her,
I'm not ashamed to admit it.
Did I ever tell you about the time I held her in my arms?
That was a long time ago, in Hollywood.
I was working as a stuntman on one of her films.
Oh boy, that's an experience
I'll never forget.
Watch it, Sarge!
What the hell are you trying to do, kill us?
I didn't want you to hit the elephants.
What elephants?
Those.
How did you know those elephants were gonna cross in front of us?
I didn't see them.
That means you didn't either.
I don't know.
Intuition.
Oh yeah?
So who's gonna cross in front of us now, huh?
Come on, give us a flash of that intuition.
Come on!
I can't.
Elephants yes, nuns no, huh?
Aw.
Be right back.
Hi Uncle Willy.
With Dave again, huh?
Hello, never mind about
Dave and give me my lunch.
Hey!
* Super snooper
* Super super super.
Okay, see you later.
Okay, bye.
[Speed] No longer any doubt, I had super powers.
But they would come and go for no apparent reason.
I wanted to talk to Sarge about it, but I couldn't get a word in edgewise.
He wouldn't stop talking about Rosy Labouche.
And there was another time
I was playing the
Russian centurion.
Russian centurion?
No no, Roman centurion. (Laughing)
Oh, yeah.
And I was supposed to dive in the water to save her from a whole bunch of crocodiles, right?
Well I had all this armor plate on me, and I sank right down to the bottom like a stone.
Yeah, what happened?
Well I nearly drowned.
Yes sir, those were the days, boy.
Answer the radio.
What? There's nobody calling us.
[Radio] This is headquarters calling car 40.
Headquarters calling car 40, come in car 40.
Intuition.
This is car 40, come in Tiger Lilly.
[Radio] Head over to 11474th Street, we have a robbery in progress on the 20th floor of the offices of
Johnson & Johnson, that's right across from the Daily Herald building.
We're on our way!
You know, you and this intuition are starting to get on my nerves, kid.
Don't move!
Nobody move!
Get over here!
Come on, get 'em up!
Oh hi Sarge!
Silvius, what's up?
Oh, I don't know nothing.
What's going on?
They've blocked them all.
Now we gotta climb all that way.
Come on!
Hurry up!
Let's get out of here!
We're almost there, come on!
Only five more.
Wait a minute, Sarge.
There.
Here's what we're gonna use, the old charge system.
What's a charge system?
It never fails, the old charge system.
You charge the door and I'll cover you from the back here.
Okay?
I charge the door?
You charge the door, I'm gonna cover you from back here.
Good thinking, Sarge.
Check the door and see if anybody's coming.
* Super snooper.
Beautiful!
Fantastic, beautiful!
It brings tears to my eyes to see a trick like that.
Oh, really?
Grab his gun.
I say.
Somebody better get an ambulance.
That boy's gonna be hurt awful bad.
Don't move or you'll end up like your buddy.
Watch the door, there might be more cops.
Hey Sarge, it's over.
Huh?
Yeah.
Boy, somebody up there sure likes you.
If it hadn't been for that platform down there, you'd have been splattered all over that sidewalk.
But what took you so long to get back up here!
Forget it Sarge.
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me anyway.
All right, get 'em up there!
What are you so happy about?
I'm happy about the way we busted up that robbery.
If you stick with me, we're gonna go places.
What now?
There's illegal gambling going on in that truck!
Gambling?
Put 'em up!
All right, get out!
Police, open up!
Nobody move, you're under arrest.
I called headquarters.
Hey kid, next time you get a tip-off like this, tell me before you act, will you?
It wasn't a tip-off.
I looked at the side of the truck...
Look, I don't wanna know.
I'm just your superior officer.
From now on, you don't think, you don't act, you don't speak until you get it from me, you understand?
Get your hands up there!
Come on, let's go!
All right!
Dave, you're not even watching the game!
Aw I know, I bet you're thinking about racing around in your car and catching crooks, aren't you?
No.
Well then what are you thinking about?
Well.
I was just thinking how much I'd like to be alone with you right now.
(laughing) In this crowd?
Sure.
What crowd?
Look, there's a little job I gotta take care of, be right back.
You're under arrest, Scardella.
I don't know how you did it.
We've been after Scardella for over two years.
I still don't see how you spotted him in all that crowd.
Well Sarge, I wanted to be alone with Evelyn, even though I know you don't approve.
So I had everyone disappear.
And there we were,
Evelyn, Scardella and me.
You had everybody disappear?
You want me to believe that?
It's the truth.
Now look, you!
You stop this nonsense or so help me you're gonna be driving a garbage truck, you got it?
Got it.
Good!
Disappear.
You just hit a driver.
Wait a minute, where are you going?
Hold it right there.
Hey!
Drop your gun!
For God's sake, shoot him!
Get back, get out of here all of you.
Hold it right there.
Stop!
Relax, the game's over.
Shit!
Hold it!
Drop the gun.
Hold it!
First thing tomorrow morning, you go back to the firing range.
You never even hit him once.
Let me have those cuffs.
Get 'em up there!
Come on, back there.
Come on!
[Speed] Poor Sarge, how could I tell him the truth?
* Super snooper
* Super super super
What made you suspect that there was a robbery taking place here,
Officer Dunlop?
Oh well, my partner and I, we were passing by the supermarket, and well, the first thing you know, well we spotted the suspect sitting in a getaway car, and well...
Thank you Chief.
Anything you would care to add, Officer Speed?
Not really.
Sergeant Dunlop has said it all.
I'm just fortunate to be teamed with such a man.
[Reporter] Chief, you must be awfully proud of these men.
Well I'll tell you, it all comes from years of dedication, hard work, and a city that I've lived in.
Paradise?
Yes boss.
Those two cops are getting too big for their britches.
Why worry?
They can't pin anything on you.
What you do is legal and above the board.
You got the richest fishing business in the golf course.
(laughing) Yeah.
Call the Barracuda, I want a partner's report.
Sandy, Mr. Torpedo's on the phone.
Yeah, hello, boss?
Yeah, everything's going like clockwork.
Yeah, we're shipping out a hundred brands worth of George Washingtons right now.
Hey, Sarge!
It says here that your Rosy
Labouche is making a comeback.
Did you know that?
Sure I knew that.
I know everything about Rosy.
Like a cup of coffee?
Yeah, black please.
Hey, Sarge, I did it!
Did what?
I had the cup fly over to me just by thinking about it!
Yeah Sarge!
Look, I wanna tell you something.
You cannot go around telling people that you have cups flying into your hand!
That you can look through walls and see elephants.
Sarge.
[Dunlop] You understand me?
Hey Sarge, that truck.
It's carrying counterfeit bills.
What?
How do you know?
Well, I saw through the side.
Come on, we're gonna go take a look, come on!
Open up this truck, come on!
Okay, man.
All right, let's go, open it up back here.
You want me to open it up?
Just open it up.
What do you got in there?
Fish.
All right, close it down.
Go ahead, beat it.
Okay, okay.
Counterfeit bills.
All I saw in there were fish!
Now I'm not saying they weren't counterfeit fish.
But even if they were, there's no law against it!
Or is there?
Dave, I've been thinking about the stadium.
You know, I mush have been really crazy to think that everyone disappeared.
You're not crazy, Evelyn.
Everyone did disappear.
Oh come on, Dave.
Evelyn.
I have to tell you something.
I'm, well, how can I put this.
I'm not normal any more.
I'm different.
Dave.
Oh come on Evelyn, not that kind of different.
You see, ever since
I went to Creektown and got caught in that explosion, something happened inside me.
It's like, it's like a part of me over which I have no control, was suddenly switched on.
Dave darling, I won't pretend I know what you're talking about, but why don't we discuss that later?
And I'll go put on my bathing suit and let's go in the water.
You go ahead, I can't swim.
I grew up in the mountains, remember?
Well, don't worry about it.
I'll teach you.
Okay.
Hey kids!
Don't worry, I'll get it for you.
Whoa, he's walking on water!
David!
[Speed] Help!
Help!
It's all right.
Wow.
Come on, come on Dave.
We're almost there.
I can't, I can't swim!
David?
Oh my God.
Hey, why don't you give him mouth to mouth?
Yeah, okay, great.
Hi Sarge, what's up?
How did you know it was me?
No no, don't tell me, let me guess.
Listen you, I want you over here right away so you can tell the Chief exactly what you been telling me about all that super power stuff, you got it?
And you got five minutes to get here, you understand?
Five minutes, Sergeant?
He lives on the other side of town.
Reporting for duty, sir.
You see that, Chief?
You see that?
Those are the cute little tricks
I gotta put up with every single day!
Well I've had it!
I've had it right up to here!
But Sergeant, you're the one who gave him only five minutes to get here.
Well then he's got an answering service, that's what he's got!
That's not true, Sarge.
At ease, Sergeant.
At ease.
You know, Officer Speed,
I've always enjoyed a good practical joke too.
Well I've been known in my day to play a couple myself.
I'll never forget one time, right after I came out of police college,
I painted myself green head to toe to pretend to be a
Martian! (Laughing)
Yeah, that's right.
But he had be almost believing that he fell 20 floors without hurting himself!
Oh, that doesn't sound possible to me.
It doesn't sound possible?
Huh.
Let me show you something.
Be right back.
* Super snooper.
What happened?
Call an ambulance.
Yes sir.
Don't touch him, wait
'til the medic gets here.
What, what, what...
As you can see from this X-ray taken right after his admission this morning, there isn't an unbroken bone in his body!
Beats me how he's still alive.
Sarge.
Yeah kid, what is it?
I don't want, I don't want
Evelyn to see me this way.
Oh okay.
All right.
What did he say?
Nothing, nothing.
Listen honey, why don't we wait outside over here.
There's really nothing we can do, and we might as well get out.
We took other X-rays after we put him in his cast.
They should be ready soon.
But I'm afraid that, well even if the bone's set correctly, the internal damage is too extensive to encourage optimism.
If you'll excuse me.
[Chief] Why did you do it, Officer Speed?
Were you that unhappy on the force?
Chief.
What?
The door.
What about the door?
It's a miracle, it's a miracle!
Look, we took another set of X-rays of Officer Speed.
The bones are completely healed!
It's a miracle!
Dave!
Dave, it's a miracle!
The doctor said...
Dave?
Dave!
Dave.
Oh Dave.
Oh sorry Chief.
Chief?
[Speed] I'd been looking for Silvius all day.
He was the only person who had seen my two falls.
I had a hunch he could explain what went wrong the second time.
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen, see the elephant.
One please.
Seven.
Thank you, 750 pounds.
Alive, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much.
You always work here?
I guess if you call peddling tickets all day long working, yeah I am, why?
I'm looking for an old guy named Silvius.
I heard he worked here a couple times.
What's it to you?
Oh yeah, Silvius, I know him.
He's a ventriloquist, really a great talent.
You wanna know something?
He can actually make a doggy talk like a human being.
I think he's had it a little rough lately.
What do you mean?
Well, for the last year, I haven't seen him around here.
That's quite a while.
I think he owes somebody some money or something.
You got any idea where he lives?
Well last time I heard, he was living over on River Road, in an old shack, selling dogs or something.
Thanks.
Hey mister.
I didn't think nothing at the time, but a little while ago there were three guys over here, asking about him.
What did you tell them?
Same thing I told you.
Thanks again.
That's all right.
Hey Silvius!
Anybody home?
Silvius?
Hey boy.
Want a biscuit?
There you go.
Hey Silvius.
Hello?
Silvius!
Hey Silvius, you here?
Search the joint.
What are we looking for, Paradise?
30,000 that Mr. Torpedo paid for the talking chihuahua.
Chihauhaus don't talk!
That's why the boss wants to get rid of it, and why he wants to get rid of Silvius too.
Find anything?
Nothing, Paradise.
Check in the closet.
Hi.
Hi.
There's a guy in there, but he isn't Silvius.
Hi.
Who are you?
I know who I am, and
I know who you are.
But do you know who he is?
Hey, Paradise, I think
I've seen this guy on TV, but I can't remember whether he's a singer or an evangelist.
I don't care what he is.
What are you doing here, and where is Silvius?
Beats me.
But even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you three jerks.
What did he say?
He said that we're three jerks, Paradise.
Uh, yeah.
He's yours.
Two goes with the guitar, then it's my turn.
This is it.
That's good, huh?
You're the tops, Paradise!
Come on.
He won't be back so soon.
Hey, you guys going?
I've gotta have a chance to get even.
Should I get the guitar, Paradise?
Don't get it.
This is yours.
I think you should let me get the guitar, Paradise!
It's okay.
I told you, you should have let me get the guitar, Paradise.
Yeah, that's the best idea.
Hey, go find a fire hydrant.
Now be good, boys.
[Announcer] Now here's a flash for all you movie buffs.
Famous film star Rosy Labouche will be arriving in our fair city at four o'clock.
Miss Labouche will be appearing every night this week.
Hey fellas.
Yes boss!
Go to the airport and pick her up.
Did ya, did ya find the old man with the dogs yet?
No boss, we...
Well find him!
You know he and I got some unfinished business!
You know I got the nervous stomach.
You know that, don't you?
Now go on, get outta here.
Where you going? The back door!
Sorry boss.
How come you our assignment changed to the sea plane base today, Sarge?
Well boy, I'll tell you something.
There are some people who only fall in love one time in their life.
I'm one of those lucky people.
What the heck does that mean?
Never mind, you'll find out.
Hey.
Those goons belong to Tony Torpedo.
They must have come down to pick her up.
Pick who up?
Rosy Labouche, you dope.
Oh.
If only I could talk to her, just once.
Talk to her?
What about that time you held her in your arms?
Well I, I, I just helped her down from the stagecoach, that's all.
Thank you.
Hey, here she comes.
Yeah. Yeah.
Oh!
Isn't she beautiful?
Oh, if only I could talk to her.
Sarge, I'll fix it for you.
No!
No no no, you stay out of this!
Don't worry, no superpowers.
Just take the patrol car over to arrivals.
Hey, that's the guy we met at Silvius' house.
Yes.
That's all we need.
Let's go.
Your driver's license, please.
Please Officer, we're in a hurry.
We've got to pick up the lady.
Registration, please.
Give me the registration.
What's the matter?
My fingers!
What about your fingers?
They're stuck in this door!
Oh yeah.
You ought to be more careful.
Get out of the car, all of you.
Let's have a roadside test.
[Reporter] Miss Labouche, it's good to see you in town.
Well thank you very much, yes, it's good to be here.
Hold out your arms.
Lift your left leg.
I said your left leg!
Now play angels.
Play angels?
Yeah, you know, flag your wings.
Like this?
Right.
Faster.
Faster.
Forget it, you'll never fly.
Uh uh uh, your arms!
Kick your right leg.
Left.
Right.
Left.
Right.
Left.
Right.
Left, right.
Good, keep it up.
Thank you.
Pardon me, but, may I be of help, Miss Labouche?
Oh, you know my name, Sergeant.
Everybody does.
You may not remember me, but I worked in a few of your films!
And I'll never forget it.
Sergeant.
Yes!
Would you do me a favor?
Anything, just ask.
I must be in my hotel within 10 minutes.
I'm expecting a very important phone call.
I would consider it an honor if I could take you!
My bags.
Are you married, Sergeant?
Uh, I, I,
I've always been dedicated to my work, and to my mother.
But then I got into motion pictures, oh watch your scarf ma'am, and then I got into work there, and I was never much of an actor, but I always liked to do a lot of stunts, you see.
So I got into stunt work for a while...
Okay, that's enough.
Let's double check your reflexes, move over here.
Okay.
Now you hit him, and you make sure you duck real fast.
I gotta hit him?
You duck real fast.
Now you hit him, and you duck real fast.
Now you hit him, and you duck real fast.
Great.
Now all together, come on.
Right, left.
Right, left.
Right, left.
Right, left.
Right, left.
Right, left.
That's it.
Okay, you passed the test.
Get back in the car.
Okay, you can go.
Your license.
I'm gonna report you for reckless driving, and damage to private property.
Licence please.
What were you thinking about, Sergeant?
What possessed you to use your patrol car as a taxi?
Well it was an emergency, Chief.
I was just doing my duty.
Your duty is to catch criminals, not play Boy Scout!
Look at this desk.
Covered with complaints.
Do you know this city's been overtaken with a rash of tarnished green?
What?
Look at this.
10,000 of these have been picked up in the past week.
Who picked 'em up?
Who found 'em?
Who lost 'em?
They're counterfiet, dummy.
It's no wonder the people take them, when not even police sergeants can tell the difference.
Who questions a lousy dollar bill, anyway?
The guy who thought this up is a genius.
I want you and Officer
Speed to bring him in.
Put this on, Mama
Loves Money, next race.
All right.
I think I just spotted Silvius.
Stick to him like a piece of honey, Paradise.
Right, boss.
[Announcer] And there goes Speedy.
Who's there?
Who's the donut waving?
How should I know?
I don't mix with people like that.
Are you here because of Rosy?
Are you kidding?
On my day off, I become a connoisseur of the dog.
In order to make enough money to pay taxes so that you can guard me.
Although why I bothered today, I don't know.
Man's best friend.
Well wait a minute, Sarge, you sure you wanna do that?
Why not?
'Cause he's gonna win.
Ha!
That dog couldn't win even if the rabbit carried him!
Come on!
[Announcer] He's passing, he's moving.
Look at him go!
He's fifth, he's fourth!
He's first!
He did it!
He did it!
I'm going up to get my winnings!
16 to one!
* Super snooper.
Can I have another please, honey.
Keep the change.
Silvius!
I've been looking all over for you, I have to talk to you.
Sorry, I don't have time now.
Hey fellas, are you by any chance chasing that nice old man in the station wagon?
Who, us?
Yeah, you!
Oh no, we are just out for a drive.
Oh good.
Well, drive carefully,
'cause the lives you save might be your own.
Have a nice day!
Thank you.
Hey, look where you're going!
Hey Silvius, I've got to talk to you.
Do you have time now?
Sure I have time now.
What do you know about my superpowers?
Why do they come and go?
You mean you don't know?
No, if I did I wouldn't need to talk to you.
Well you see, an act like yours, it sometimes only takes one dumb little thing to destroy your concentration.
A place, a person, a color, a noise.
You lost him?
You let a little old man get away?
But boss, it was that cop.
What cop?
What are you talking about?
It was the one who is the friend of the friend of your friend,
I mean, Madame Labouche.
The idiot means Dave Speed.
He's the partner of the chubby cop who's madly in love with me.
I'm not interested in love stories!
I'm interested in an old man!
You've got to find him, and I want him found, do you understand?
Why do you always tell me these things when I start to eat!
Dave?
Dave?
Dave, we're here.
Hey Dave!
That's really weird.
I wonder where he could be.
Well wherever he is, he's late.
Wrong, Sarge, you're late.
Well, you're...
Floating.
Now tell me you don't believe he has superpowers.
Come down from there!
Why don't you come up here?
It's fun.
Are you crazy?
Okay.
Evelyn, did you bring what I asked you to bring?
Sure did.
Get the hell down from up there, now come down!
You could have waited
'til I was ready.
I'm sorry Dave.
That's all right.
Now put it away please.
Right.
Ready Sarge?
Watch.
(laughing) See?
Okay Evelyn.
Please show it to me again.
Wait!
Now.
Okay.
Thanks.
I finally found out why my powers come and go.
It's the color red.
Red?
What are you talking about?
Whenever I see red,
I lose my powers.
Let me try and explain it to you.
A plutonic explosion caused the blinding red light that gave me the superpowers.
But the same color red also takes them away whenever I see it.
Get it Sarge?
Two forces, equal but opposite, equal zero.
Remember the nuns?
And, and, and when I jumped out the window?
And the stadium.
Right, and the fish truck.
Oh yeah, the fish truck.
I sure remember that.
You really made me look like a schtook.
Sarge.
The inside of the truck was all red.
That's why I couldn't see the phony bills any longer.
You the trying to tell me that the money was inside the fish?
You got it.
You got it.
Now, can you remember what was written on the side of the truck?
Yeah, Torpedo Fish Company.
Right, that's our man.
Torpedo, get it?
No, I don't get it.
What do you want me to do, arrest the guy?
Can you imagine what the judge and jury would think if you stood up in court and say,
I realized those counterfeit bills were inside the fish,
'cause I looked through the side of the truck.
Why, they'd lock you up!
But Sarge.
Come on!
You need positive proof, and I know where to get it!
(sighs) Will you quit thinking I'm nuts?
Don't you realize a man's thoughts are his own, his own private thoughts, so stop butting in!
I've never seen him so mad.
You should spend time in the car with him.
It's not all his fault.
Why not?
Dave, something's not right.
Evelyn, what's the matter?
Well, it's your superpowers.
I mean, I don't know if I'll ever be able to get used to them.
I love you, but I want you the way you were.
Come on Evelyn.
Be positive.
Look, I can wash dishes, do the laundry, make the bed, chop vegetables, just by thinking about it.
Imagine, you're going to marry a walking, talking domestic appliance.
Batteries included.
Oh, terrific.
A human Cuisinart.
When you wanna be serious, you can find me at home.
Freeze.
Evelyn, I've got these superpowers and there's nothing
I can do about it.
And you know something?
I like them.
And I think you'll grow to like them too.
Look, I love you Evelyn, and we are going to get married whether you like it or not.
All right.
Now you can relax.
That same evening, I got a list of places where the phony bills had turned up, and set out to find positive proof that would point the finger at Tony Torpedo.
Ball in the corner pocket.
Two ball in the side pocket.
14 in the corner pocket.
14 in the corner.
Hey, sir.
Sir?
Hey, knock it off, will you?
What do you want?
Sorry but, I'm looking for the owner of this place.
Well you found him.
Now get lost!
I got five bucks riding on this ball.
Five more says you won't make it.
Make it 10 and you've got a bet.
Wait a minute.
All right, you're on.
Okay, it's your money, sucker. (Chuckling)
Hey, I won.
Yeah!
What are you laughing about?
Yeah, you shouldn't laugh at somebody else's misfortune.
I know how you feel, mister.
Can we settle now?
You do, huh?
Yeah, come on.
Dumb luck.
Here we go.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
10 on the head.
10 good American bucks, kid.
Enjoy yourself.
Thanks.
Where's the john?
It's back there.
Hey, it's locked.
What the hell do you mean it's locked?
That thing is always open.
You try it.
Ah, wait a minute, will ya?
Hey!
Let's stop fooling around.
You're in bad trouble.
Yeah, 10 good American bucks.
Hey, these are really going down the drain.
You're laundering phony bills, and I want a piece of the action, Clyde.
All right.
500 a week and I'll stay off your back.
Nothing smaller than a five.
I understand.
Cops are all alike.
Here.
You can tell Torpedo, the time has come to share the pie.
* Tell me when will you say yes
* Tell me
* Cuando, cuando, cuando
* We can share a love divine
* Please don't make me wait again
* When will you say yes.
Well, do you want to hear my plan or don't you?
Oh, sure.
Phase one, convince the underworld that
I'm a crooked cop.
Phase two, catch
Torpedo in the act.
Marvelous.
Just marvelous.
Thanks.
I appreciate you liking it.
Like it?
I love it!
Why don't you ask her to dance, huh?
Are you crazy?
We're on duty!
So what?
If the Chief finds out about it, then tell him you were questioning a witness.
Dancing on duty is a violation of police code 42 slash B.
Oh Sarge, you are a credit to the force.
Besides, I don't know how to dance.
Sarge, look at me.
You're going to dance like Fred Astaire.
Like Fred Astaire.
I'm going to dance like Fred Astaire.
Now here's someone who really wants to dance.
Shall we dance, Sergeant?
I'd love to.
Ah, you dance divinely.
I'm just trying to keep up with you.
Oh I know, you've come to tell me that your boss wants to see me and I'm to follow you to his office.
I come to tell you that the boss wants to see you.
And that you have to follow me to his office.
Hey wait a moment.
Didn't you just tell me that?
Did I?
Oh, let's go.
Hey man.
How come you always throw 12?
Because Torpedo's men are impossible to beat.
Throw me another.
Hey, that's hard to beat.
It's impossible to beat.
No kidding.
May I try?
Be my guest.
Let's roll 'em again.
Eenie meenie minie mo.
Catch a tiger by his toe.
If he hollers, let him go.
Now that's hard to beat.
Take the money and run.
Come on.
Thank you.
You see, he has these superpowers.
He can do anything he wants, and make other people do the same.
You make him sound like something out of a comic strip.
Oh no no.
Oh no.
He's just as human as we are.
Oh?
The only thing is that, every time he sees red, he loses his superpowers.
Oh, really?
So you're police officer Davey Speed, huh?
You've been making a lot of noise around town.
I think it's about time you and I sat down.
* Super snooper
* Super super super.
You lousy flat-footed smartass.
Ain't fooling me!
I know you're pretending to be a corrupt cop because you hope I'll admit to putting out a contract on old Silvius.
Sure I had that no good bum killed.
But you think I'm gonna tell you?
No.
Forget it, I ain't got rocks in my head, and there's no way I'm ever gonna tell you where I print those phony one-doller bills my men pass out on the streets.
Boss!
And you'll never find out that the press is set up in my fishing boat, the Barracuda, which is anchored in the Gulf!
You know why?
Why?
Because there's no cop smarter than I am.
Hey flat foot.
I bet you can't guess how we transport those phony bills from the boat to the drop zones.
Well, let me see.
Sewn into the fish.
Sewn into the bellies of the fish your boat catches, right?
Thank you, Mr. Torpedo, that's all I wanted to know.
Hey look!
There she is, the Barracuda.
Looks deserted.
Don't be too sure.
I wish you could fly this thing so I could go down and take a look.
Well I'll go down.
You?
I don't think that's a good idea, Sarge.
Why not?
What's the matter, you think I'm too old?
Come on, get us over that old bathtub over there, I'll show ya.
Anything you say.
All right?
Okay.
Now listen you.
You take care of Evelyn.
I used to get more when I was a stuntman.
I'm gonna go down below and take a look, okay?
Okay Sarge, go down in the hole of it, anywhere.
[Dunlop] Hey
Dave, you read me?
Loud and clear.
What's happening down there?
[Dunlop] Think Torpedo's been pulling your leg.
There's not a soul on board.
No printing press, nothing!
Search again, it's gotta be there.
Okay.
But I tell you there's nothing down here.
Aha.
Dave, listen Dave, I found it!
I found it!
You hear me, Dave?
I found it.
It's a counterfeiter's dream.
Phony bills, plates, press.
We got enough evidence here to put Torpedo away for life,
I'm telling you!
Now go back to town and get some help.
I'll be waiting for you, baby!
Okay Sarge, I'll be back before you know it.
Bye.
Hurry up!
Come on, come on!
Hello, hello?
We're sinking the Barracuda.
We caught one of the cops sneaking around.
We're gonna leave him on board so he goes down with her.
Over and out.
Let's move!
Move it, move it!
We don't have a lot of time before the boat goes down.
Everybody, off of the boat!
Hey!
(knocking) Hey!
Officer Speed, what have you done with him?
Done with who, Chief?
[Chief] Sergeant Dunlop.
Oh, Sarge.
He's on the Barracuda.
I told you so over the radio.
That's where Tony Torpedo's been printing the phony bills.
Why don't you ask her?
She can tell you a lot more than I can.
Chief, I've told you everything I know.
Last night at the
Mocambo I overheard that man try to extort protection money from Mr. Torpedo.
He's a corrupt cop, and
Sergeant Dunlop found out.
That's why he had to kill him.
After all Chief, he couldn't afford to let him talk.
That ridiculous!
She's lying.
Why don't you send a patrol out to check on the Barracuda?
You'll find Sarge there sitting on the evidence.
We just ad a report from the Coast Guard, Chief.
There's no boat within a 50-mile radius of the coordinates given to us by Officer Speed.
You're under arrest for the first-degree murder of police sergeants
William Dunlop.
There's nothing worse than a corrupt cop, Speed.
Take him away and lock him up.
[Speed] And that, my friends, is how I ended up on Death Row.
Rosy Labouche made sure I couldn't use my superpowers, and she always arranged to have something red clearly visible any place I was taken.
The only thing that saved me so far is that they haven't allowed Rosy to be present each time they tried to execute me.
Warden.
Where did the flowers come from?
Well they're from Rosy
Labouche, the film star.
I'll read the card.
Today.
May the red of these flowers bring the warmth you deserve.
Rosy.
You must be very proud to have a friend like Rosy Labouche.
May I keep this as a souvenir?
Oh sure.
Thank you.
I'm allowed on last wish, right?
Oh, of course.
I'd like, um, bubble gum.
Bubble gum.
Could you please put it in my pocket?
I'll have it later.
Thanks.
Father?
I want you to have those flowers, for the altar in your church.
We should check out all sea traffic within 50 miles of the shore, ten fore.
Jesus!
* He's a super snooper

Come on you old bear.
Your hibernation is over.
* He's a super snooper
* Really super trooper
* A wonder cop a one like you never saw.
Well you finally showed up.
Where the hell have you been?
Well, it's a long story.
What the hell is this?
It smells like...
Hell, it tastes like chewing gum!
Whatever you say Sarge, you're always right.
Take it easy Sarge.
Just stay in the same place, you'll be fine!
We're flying!
Relax!
Now listen, there's a lot I have to tell you, after I left you on the Barracuda.
* A wonder cop a one like you never saw.
Rosy?
What's the hurry?
What's the rush?
Both the cops are dead.
Dunlop is.
But I'm not so sure about Speed.
He's gonna show up sooner or later, and I don't wanna be around when he does.
Don't wanna be around, huh?
Well, where are we going?
Somewhere where a millionairess can live in style and peace.
Cuba.
Cuba?
Cuba, huh?
You know, I can't even speak the language!
That's why we're going.
We bring you this special news report following up on our leads about the jailbreak of Dave Speed.
Earlier today, a large balloon erupted from the sea heading towards outer space with two men attached.
Mr. Belushi here was fishing out of the Gulf and saw the event.
Are these the two men?
Yes, yes!
Those are the two men!
Those are?
Yes, yes!
Ladies and gentlemen, the two men he pointed out are Dave Speed and the late Sergeant Willy Dunlop.
We'll be back with further developments on this most unusual event as soon as they happen.
Understand now, Sarge?
Yeah!
Now will you please get me down?
Will you let go!
What do you want from me?
You're gonna be our passport out of here, baby.
With you as hostage,
Speed wouldn't dare try any of his superpower tricks.
Did you get the plane?
Oh yes, Madame.
We had to get rid of the pilot.
You had to get rid of the pilot!
Yeah.
Who's gonna fly it?
Who?
I am.
Who?
I am!
Come on, let's go!
Hey boss.
Over my dead body!
Hey boss, take a look over there.
There, look!
[Torpedo] So it's a balloon!
Come on, you're wasting time, let's go!
Hey look!
Rosy and Torpedo are making a getaway.
They've got Evelyn!
They've got Evelyn?
We gotta stop 'em!
You'll never get away with this, they'll catch you!
Eh, shut up.
They'll put you in jail and throw the key away!
Shut up!
You stay here
Sarge, I'll stop them.
Stay here, where you going?
To catch a plane!
Whoa, what's happening?
Relax, it's just an air pocket.
Oh, oh!
Dave!
* He's a super snooper
* Really super trooper
* A wonder cop a one like you never saw.
Calling all cars, calling all cars.
This is Officer Dave Speed.
Sergeant Dunlop's alive.
We're putting an end to the gang.
Arriving at sea plane base any minute.
Hey Chief.
If this operation is a success, we'll re-elect the governor.
Over.
* He's a super snooper
* Really super trooper
* A wonder cop a one like you never saw
* He's a super snooper

I can't, I can't control her.

You've stopped the aircraft!
Why?

* He's a super snooper

* Really super trooper

All right, everybody out of the plane!
Get out of there!
Keep your hands up!
Am I glad to see you guys!
Am I glad, hey, what are you doing?
David!
Evelyn!
Oh David.
Oh, I was so scared.
Oh, Evelyn.
Sorry I put you through all that.
Well how did you do it?
You know, my superpowers.
My greatest role.
What an ending.
Officer Speed.
Congratulations.
Thank you Chief.
Boy, that was a fine piece of work.
I knew you were innocent right from the beginning.
Of course you did, Chief.
I always knew that
Rosy Labouche and Torpedo were the real culprits.
You said that Sergeant
Dunlop is alive.
Where is he?
On the balloon?
Dave!
Hey, you're not the only one baby, look at me!
Shh!
This is the Sarge!
I'm sitting on top of the world, don't you dare.
Dave, I'm coming down.
You gotta get me baby, you gotta get me.
Come on!
No!
[Evelyn] David, look out, you have something red around your leg!
Here we go!
Dave, Uncle Willy!
We can all be proud of Officer Dave Speed.
He died in a valiant, vain attempt to save the life of his friend and superior officer,
Sergeant William Dunlop.
We'll remember them with honor and pride.
Excuse me Chief, there's a call for you.
This is hardly the moment.
Have you no respect for the valiant dead?
I really think you should take this call, sir.
It's uh, long distance.
Ah, fine.
What?
What?
Who?
Is this some kind of a sick joke?
That's right Chief!
That's right, we're fine!
Yeah, we're okay!
Yeah, what?
Where are we calling from?
Um, just a minute.
Where are we calling from?
That's right.
Dave, Uncle Willy?
Hello Evelyn, how are you?
Dave is here, just a minute.
Evelyn.
Hello Evelyn, how are you?
Oh, we're fine.
That is, thanks to my superpowers.
Let's get married.
I know you'll learn to live with them.
[Priest] David Speed, will you have this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife, until death do you part?
I will.
[Priest] Evelyn Dunlop, will you have this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?
I will.
[Priest] By the powers vested in me,
I pronounce you husband and wife.
You may now kiss the bride.

Dexter, you are such a child!
You and Henry both are such children.
But at least Henry has me to take care of him. Don't you, dear?
Tabby, Richard...
...l'd like you to meet Dexter Stanley...
...our distinguished professor in the zoology department.
They're both new here in the math department.
How do you do?
What a lovely name you have.
Actually, it's Tabitha.
- Pleasure to meet you, Professor Stanley.
- Just Dex will do.
This is Henry and Wilma Northrup.
Just call me Billie. Everyone does.
You need anyone to show you the ropes, hon, just come see me.
I know all the best stores.
Nice to meet you.
Are you buying or renting?
We're renting at the moment.
It's just as well.
Buying real estate in a college town is a pain in the ass.
Take my word for it.
Henry is in the English department.
And Wilma...
I just take care of Henry.
Believe me, he needs it.
Did you ever meet a man who didn't?
You're not drinking?
Actually, we just got here.
Well, we can take care of that.
Just come with me.
Stay here until I get back.
These people are dry. Take care of them.
They don't know what they're doing.
And if Dexter hadn't had his teeth capped, he'd have been out on his ass years ago.
So when Parker told me that I was out of line...
...I told him he ought to get laid.
"Parker," I said, "if you'd just have your ashes hauled...
"...you wouldn't have to spend all this time playing Emily Vanderbilt!"
Or Emily Van Buren...
...whoever that etiquette crotch is!
Excuse me.
I don't know why they keep inviting her!
How about tonight?
Maybe we could do it tonight?
That would be great.
All right, I'll call you about it.
I gather you'll be unavailable for chess tonight.
Henry, I'm just about reaching a point where l...
Pardon me. Would one of you be Professor Stanley?
Yes, I am.
- There is a telephone call for you.
- All right. Thank you.
Probably be Charlie again with his damn ear mites.
He'll get the Nobel Prize before he's 20!
Especially if he's working at Amberson Hall in August.
No, he's downstairs. It's cooler.
Yeah, sure, I'll come tonight.
Well, thanks.
Hey, what are friends for?
Just call me Billie.
Everyone does.
I thought I should call you anyway, see what you thought.
Did Charlie tell you I was here?
Yeah. I sent him out for a hamburger.
I had to insist.
That kid doesn't know if it's night or day when he gets going.
Yes, he's very dedicated.
I'm willing to bet that crate...
... is full of National Geographics
or back issues of the Reader's Digest.
The date on it said 1834.
Did they publish a Reader's Digest way back then?
1834? Really?
Yes, it's stenciled right on the side.
June 19, 1834.
And then something about an "Arctic Expedition."
There may be something more interesting in your crate than periodicals after all.
...because everyone in the department is looking to put the knife in you.
I mean, some of these so-called "academics"...
...make the shark in Jaws look like fucking Flipper!
Wilma!
Your husband is calling you, Billie.
Oh, God, Henry! What's wrong now?
Not a thing, Wilma.
Everything is just fine.
Hell of a shot.
Bull's-eye.
Henry, can't you do anything right?
Huh?
"Huh?" That's what I figured!
That is just what I would expect from you!
I told you half an hour ago to get one of them...
...kids in the monkey suits to bring the car around!
Oh, I'm sorry.
You are such a little kid.
I swear to God you are.
Where would you be without me to take care of you?
I still think your crate is full of old magazines and just plain junk.
It's chained though.
"Arctic Expedition."
And that date!
It kind of gets you, doesn't it?
Yes, it kind of does.
Got it.
It's kind of heavy.
I'll just swing this in.
Let's set it down over here.
I'm surprised that you didn't open it yourself.
No, I figured that was for you.
Why didn't you tell Charlie?
He's just a grad student.
And with Professor Tirrell being in England,
I figure you're the boss.
Hold this on it.
What made you look under here?
I flipped a quarter trying to decide...
...if I should buff the second-floor hallway first or wash the lab windows.
But when it came down, I missed it.
Then it rolled under here.
Oh! There it is.
I probably would have let it go, only it was my last quarter for the Coke machine.
It's not very nice in there, is it?
God, I hate tight places!
- Are you okay, Doc?
- Yeah.
Help me out with this, will you?
I think we might really have something here.
What's wrong?
It felt like something shifted in there.
Did you feel it when we set it on the table?
I did feel something under the stairs.
It felt heavy.
Yeah, but it seemed like something moved on its own.
If there ever really were any living specimens in there...
...I doubt if they're feeling very lively after 147 years.
I must be spending too much time in the sun.
Let's get this open, shall we?
I got a hammer and chisel in the closet.
Just wait while I go get them.
Turn the lights on.
And don't just leave the pots soaking like you did last time!
Scrub them and put them away!
Just because you and your intellectual friend...
...are going to play chess, doesn't mean you have to leave a mess for me.
Wipe the stove!
Yes, Billie.
And kindly have him out of here before I get back from my classes.
Frankly, that tobacco he smokes makes me want to vomit!
Yes, Billie.
"Yes, Billie. Yes, Billie."
What would you do without me?
I don't know, Billie.
Well, on that we're even.
Enjoy your chess.
I bet they're worth something.
Be my guest, Mike. It's your find.
There's probably nothing in there...
...but some rocks and plants that'll turn to dust if we touch them.
But I'm pretty hot to see, just the same.
To tell you the truth, so am I.
It's loosening up.
I can't see a damn thing!
Where did I leave my flashlight?
Never mind. Let's just get the last nail out of here.
Did you hear that?
There's something in there!
Something shiny!
Looks like a couple of emeralds!
Don't!
Help me, Doc!
It's biting!
Help!
Professor Stanley, what is it?
The janitor!
The crate! It was going to attack me!
Professor, slow down!
We have to get the campus security!
Professor Stanley, slow down!
I don't know what you're talking about!
It's the janitor!
- You know Mike, the janitor?
- Yes, of course I do.
It just sucked him in!
That's pretty far out, Professor Stanley.
But it's true! I swear, it's true!
Let's get the campus police!
No! The campus security is no good!
If I'm having trouble swallowing this, what the fuck will they think?
I don't know what they would think.
They'd think you had been off on a hell of a toot.
They'd think that we'd both been off on a hell of a toot!
Seeing Tasmanian devils instead of pink elephants.
I think I'll go down...
...and see how the land lays.
No! Don't! It may be out!
I doubt that.
Charlie, please, don't go there!
Be right back, Professor Stanley.
He'll see it.
He'll see the crate, he'll see the blood!
He'll see Mike!
And then he'll believe me!
Charlie?
Charlie!
There! See the blood?
Do you think I'm crazy now?
You think that I killed him?
Look at the blood! Look...
It's gone!
What's gone?
It got out.
I thought it would be potbound after all these years, but it got out!
It pushed the crate off the table!
Look at these tracks!
It pushed the crate back in under the stairs...
...where it felt safe for so long.
Charlie, I really think...
Charlie, listen, don't go in there!
If you had seen that thing!
Don't worry.
It looks like it's been through a hay baler.
Now do you believe me?
Charlie, don't go near it.
I don't want the crate.
I want that shoe.
I want to measure the bite marks.
Then maybe we can figure out...
...what we're dealing with here.
We have to stop it! We have to stop it!
Two people are dead already!
We have to... Dear God, they died!
Hey, Dex, hold it.
What happened?
Two people are dead already, and...
Who's dead?
Where's Wilma?
She's gone. Dex, what the hell happened to you?
Two people are dead and I could be blamed.
I know that's a terrible consideration at a time like this, Henry, but...
Good God.
The last time I saw someone do that was in the movies.
It could be my ass, Henry, and it wasn't me!
It was that thing in the crate!
I don't even know what it was!
What two people?
Who is dead?
Mike, the janitor in Amberson Hall...
...and Charlie Gereson.
He wanted to measure the bite marks!
I guess he got his chance.
He most certainly did!
I can't do anything for you unless you stop being so damned elliptical.
Now, just slow down, tell me the whole story...
...from the beginning, all right?
All right. I think I can do that now.
Thank God for you, Henry.
I thought of some ideas of how to get rid of it coming over here.
I kept thinking about Ryder's Quarry.
You know the place?
I know it.
I think it would be deep enough...
...if only there was a way to get the crate over there.
You know, I kept thinking about it.
I don't know anymore!
Am I going crazy, Henry?
No.
I have to use the facilities.
I'll be back in a minute.
Then we'll decide what we need to do.
Thanks.
What are friends for?
Let's get you another drink.
No, no. I've had enough.
I'm surprised I'm not plastered out of my gore.
The shock, I guess.
Just one more for the both of us while we talk this over.
We may need it.
Yeah, okay.
Henry, goddamn it!
How many times have I told you to lock the goddamn door?
Henry!
Henry?
"Wilma, I've had to leave in a hurry...
"...because of a call from Dexter Stanley.
"He seems to have gotten himself
in a great deal of trouble.
"I'm ashamed to tell you of this...
"...but ever since Dexter's wife died...
"...he's had problems coping
with certain young female grad students.
"He's been able to cover up several
incidents but this one looks very serious.
"It seems he got a young woman...
"...to accompany him to Amberson Hall
under false pretenses...
"...and then attacked her.
"When Dex called me,
he was barely coherent.
"He was gibbering with fear
and crying, I think.
"I tried to get him to tell me
what had happened to the girl.
"But for the most part he kept repeating,
'It's awful, Henry! It's awful! '
"Wilma, could you come out here?
"I know it's asking a lot.
"But you're always so clear-headed
about these things.
"And you know how to be firm.
"I think Dex could use a firmer hand
than mine right now.
"Not to mention the girl herself.
"He said that she had curled up
in a dark place and won't come out.
"I'm sorry to have to ask you to come
over to Amberson Hall to help me out...
"...but as you so often say,
what would I do without you?"
What indeed, Henry?
What indeed?
Henry?
Henry?
Henry, where are you?
The laboratory, Wilma.
Downstairs.
What are you doing creeping around down there?
Where is Dex?
What kind of a mess has he gotten himself into?
It's easier if I just show you, I think.
Come on down.
What's this?
I found them.
Did he beat her?
How bad is she? Is she conscious?
It's easier if you just see for yourself, Wilma.
What are you laughing about?
Your best friend gets in a scrape with a girl and you're laughing?
There is a funny side to it, Wilma.
Wait till you see. You'll think so yourself.
You're hysterical, Henry.
Just what I would have expected!
No, I don't think you'll expect this, Wilma.
This is going to be an entirely new experience.
What are you doing? Let go of me!
What's going on?
The lab's the other way.
The lab. Yes, but...
The girl is under the stairs, Billie.
Wait till you see. That's what's so funny.
The girl has crawled under the stairs and she won't come out.
She's all curled up there, you know, like a little baby...
...making funny sounds.
What did he do to her?
You can get her out, Billie.
I know you can get her out.
Why don't you give it a try?
You always know how to handle these things, Billie.
No problem.
No trouble.
I know you can get her out!
What are you doing, Henry?
- What are you doing?
- What I should have done a long time ago!
Get in there, Wilma.
Just tell it to call you Billie, you bitch!
Stop it! Stop it, Henry, I'll scream!
Scream all you want. I'll help you.
Wake up!
Wake up, whatever you are!
Wake up, wake up!
Dinnertime!
Poison meat!
Wake up! Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!
That was great, Henry.
That was just great.
You think this is a Friday night fight?
Is that what you think?
You want to see some real punching?
Same old Henry.
Afraid of your own shadow.
You know what, Henry?
You're a regular barnyard exhibit.
Sheep's eyes, chicken guts...
...piggy friends...
...and shit for brains.
No good at departmental politics...
...no good at making money...
...no good at making an impression on anybody!
And no good at all in bed!
When was the last time you got it up, Henry?
When was the last time you were a man in our bed?
Now, get out of my way, or I swear you'll be wearing your balls for earrings!
I swear to God if you ever touch...
Just tell it to call you Billie.
I didn't see anyone, not a soul.
At this time of the year and no other,
the campus is almost totally deserted.
Summer session is over and fall semester
doesn't start for two more weeks.
It was almost hellishly perfect.
I never even saw a pair of headlights.
Henry, what did you do with the crate?
That's the beauty of it!
You provided the final piece
in the jigsaw puzzle yourself.
The crate is at the bottom
of Ryder's Quarry.
I drove out there with the remains
of three human beings.
Well, two human beings and Wilma.
I began to wonder, where did they go?
I mean, how much could it eat?
I think maybe, at the very end...
... it began to suspect what was happening.
So, the question is: What happens now?
There's no evidence of foul play,
I've seen to that.
And there are no bodies.
No. No, I don't suppose there are.
So, what about you, Dexter?
What are you going to say?
Nothing.
Thanks. Thank you, Dexter.
No need to thank me.
After all, what are friends for?
You understand, of course that I expect to whip your ass at chess...
...twice a week for the rest of our lives.
We'll have to see about that, won't we?
I haven't done anything to anybody.
Neither have I.
What if I woke up before you got here and called the police?
You didn't.
What if it gets out, Henry?
What if it gets out of that crate?
If you saw the way I chained it up, you wouldn't worry.
That thing has drowned in its box
70 feet down.
So, relax.
Relax.
Bastards!
Goddamned bugs.
I'll get them bugs!
I own this goddamned building.
There's not going to be any more damn bugs!
Heads are going to roll.
I promise you that!
Hello, that you, White?
No, sir, Mr. Pratt. This is George Gendron.
I just got off the plane from Seattle.
I have my report ready for typing...
The building superintendent is on vacation, George.
You believe that? Vacation!
I told them I wanted to hear from him within the hour.
Within the hour, and he now has...
It's 9:34 p.m.
...exactly 26 minutes to go...
...or he can stay on vacation permanently!
Bastard.
Sir, there was a telex here
in the office from Seattle.
I thought you'd want to hear it.
Why are you at the office at 9:30, George?
There's no overtime at the executive level.
Yes, sir, I know that.
It's about the Pacific Aerodyne takeover.
To hell with Pacific Aerodyne!
They're done for.
Norman Castonmeyer is a dinosaur!
He's too fucking blind to find his way into the nearest tar pit.
The air pollution count is up to almost seven, George!
People are dying of carbon-monoxide poisoning and don't even know it.
I found another cockroach this evening, George.
One of those big ones, right here in my $3,200-a-month penthouse apartment.
My supposedly germ-proof apartment!
Would you like to tell me, George, how an apartment can be germ-proof...
...when it's not even bug-proof?
I guess it can't, Mr. Pratt.
But I wanted you to know
that Pratt International now owns...
... the majority of Pacific Aerodyne stock.
Of course we do.
I can't talk to you now, George.
I'm going to clear up this cockroach problem once and for all!
I'm not going to have any bugs in my building.
I loathe bugs.
I realize that, but there's something
you should...
I've got to let you go, George.
You did well!
Go out and fuck somebody.
But wear a damn rubber.
Everybody's got the damn herpes these days.
Sir, Norman Castonmeyer
shot himself an hour ago.
He did it when it became clear...
... there was no way to stop the takeover.
At least that's what his wife thinks.
Wonderful!
Now we won't have to offer the old fart a seat on the board of directors.
Now, get off the phone, George.
Never run good news into the ground.
I've got this bug problem.
Once you get bugs, you never get rid of them.
They breed in the crawlspaces...
...in the conduits...
...the very core of the building itself.
Goodbye, George.
Yes, sir. Goodnight, Mr. Pratt.
Once they get a foothold in the building, you never get rid of them.
Bastards!
Reynolds? White?
Talk to me!
I just called to tell you
what a monster you are, Mr. Pratt...
... and how I will rejoice
when you're finally dead!
Lots of people are going to rejoice when I'm dead. Who are you?
Lenora Castonmeyer.
I'm the wife of the man
you murdered this afternoon!
Mrs. Castonmeyer. How are you?
I hope they keep hell hot for you!
You son of a bitch!
I hope they do.
It wasn't enough for you
to drive him to his knees, was it?
No, you had to kill him as well!
He came home...
... and his eyes...
... his eyes were so dead.
I asked him what was wrong.
What could be so bad
to make his eyes look that way?
And the only word that he could say...
... was your name.
Ten minutes later, I heard the shot.
Yes, George Gendron told me old Norman went out with a bang.
How many men have you destroyed?
How many men have you killed,
you monster?
Only the stupid ones.
Only the ones who handed me a knife and then stretched out their throats.
Only the ones who, if you'll pardon the expression, fucked up.
If you'll excuse me,
I've got this bug problem...
...so we'll have to defer your charming conversation for another time.
I hope you die!
By the way...
I hope you get cancer in the worst place.
Syphilis! Leprosy!
Scream in hell forever, you monster!
Would you mind telling me who gave you my private number?
I'd like to fire him.
It was in my husband's address book,
you son of a bitch!
Well, I can't fire him, can I?
That better be you, Reynolds.
Talk to me.
It's Carl Reynolds, sir.
I'm calling from Orlando, Florida.
Orlando? Florida?
The wife and I decided to take the kids
to Disney World this year...
I don't care if you decided to take the kids to Attica this year.
There are still roaches in this place.
I killed one not five minutes ago.
Do you like your job, Reynolds?
I've spoken to Mr. White,
who's on desk tonight.
Do you like your job, Reynolds?
Yes, sir.
I'm glad to hear it, because I want to see White.
Mr. Pratt, it's almost quarter of ten...
If I don't first see White...
...and then the exterminators within a half an hour...
...you will have no job by midnight tonight.
Do you understand me?
Next year you can take the wife and kids to Disney World on your welfare check.
Have you got that?
Are we together on this?
Yes, sir.
Good. I trust we are. Goodbye.
You have to watch them.
Castonmeyer, Reynolds...
...bugs.
That's all they are.
All of them.
And although they're essentially brainless...
...you have to watch them...
...'cause they creep up on you.
They creep up on you.
Talk to me. Who's there?
Good evening there, Mr. Pratt.
Got bugs again, huh, Mr. Pratt?
Don't you talk to me like that, you hear?
What way, Mr. Pratt?
Like I was crazy.
No, sir, Mr. Pratt, sir.
I don't think you're crazy. Not at all.
I was just trying to think...
... who might have a 24-hour
fumigating service.
I might be able to get Pirelli Brothers out here by...
... shall we say 11:30.
You might go far, White.
I've noticed that, in service jobs...
... people like yourself often do.
People of color.
Yes, 11:30 will be fine.
Thanks, Mr. Pratt, sir.
I'll call them just as soon as I finish with that shower on 23.
Do it first! Do it now.
Yes, sir. Right now.
Only stunned.
That's the explanation.
Roaches are very hard to kill...
...and they're quick.
They can creep up on you.
They can creep up on you if you let them.
You see, Mrs. Castonmeyer,
I grew up in hell's kitchen!
Bugs everywhere.
And I know what to do with a bug when I see it.
Spray it!
Squash it! Kill it!
What the fuck?
Another son-of-a-bitching blackout.
If it was my power company, this would never happen.
Goddamned bugs!
Bastards!
Fucking roaches! Goddamned bugs!
I'll kill you, you goddamned little buggers!
Come on! What do I pay you for?
Police emergency.
It's about time!
What are you people doing down there?
We've got problems tonight, fella.
- Or haven't you looked out your window?
- Listen. This is the Upson Pratt.
I've got bugs!
Everyone's got bugs tonight,
and I don't have time for bullshit.
No, you don't understand.
These are cockroaches.
The biggest ones I've ever seen.
This has to stop!
On a slow night we could maybe
talk about it, but this isn't a slow night...
I don't think you understand who you're talking to.
This is Upson Pratt! Upson Pratt!
I'll see to it you lose your job, you asshole!
White, talk to me!
White, I know you can hear me.
The PA's on the emergency circuit!
Talk to me!
Mr. Pratt, I'm stuck in the damn elevator.
You can't be stuck in the elevator.
I want you here now! There are roaches!
Hundreds of them!
I'm going to be here
until the power comes on. Sorry.
I'll have your job, you black bastard!
Come on, come on!
You'll never get in here. Never!
When this blackout is over, people will pay.
Oh, yes. And you'll pay too.
Every damn one of you!
I've been beating bugs all my life.
And I'll beat you too, bastards!
Talk to me.
Pratt!
You old monster. I hope you die.
I hope you die!
I hope you die!
I hope you die!
Mr. Pratt?
You there, Mr. Pratt?
Mr. Pratt?
Talk to me!
Talk to me. Talk to me, honky bastard.
What's the matter, Mr. Pratt?
Bugs got your tongue?
Mr. Pratt?
Mr. Pratt?
Bastard!
Chew your food before you swallow!
- What's that?
- It's a comic book.
What?
It's a comic book.
It's a comic book!
Comic book!
- My kids love these things.
- I love them too.
Hey, look, look!
You can send away for all this stuff here.
Look, x-ray glasses.
They don't work. They make your eyes black. You look in and it's a gag.
Look, an authentic voodoo doll.
- Somebody already sent for it.
- Yeah, we can't get that.
How about this?
"Tired of gettin' sand kicked in your face?"
Where's Billy?
He'll be down in a minute. I know he's up.
Billy?
Stan, are you all right?
I didn't get much sleep last night.
The storm?
No. It's this damn stiff neck.
I can barely move my head.
You must have strained it.
Yeah, I guess. I don't know.
You poor bear.
Do you want me to get some Ben Gay?
I'll teach him to throw away my comic books.
Ready for another shot, Dad?
And her ambition was to extend her realm...
to all the regions of the known world.
To this end, she gathered an army.
And she bore a son and named him Nekron.
And him she tutored in the black arts
and in the powers of the mind.
And when Nekron came of age...
and attained mastery of those powers...
together they seized control
of the region of Ice.
And from their castle called Ice Peak...
they sent a giant glacier
rumbling southward.
No village or people could stand
against its relentless onslaught.
And so the remnants of humanity
fled south...
and huddled for warmth
among the volcanoes...
of a mountain region
ruled by a generous king named Jarol...
from his fortress,
which men called Fire Keep.
And still Nekron
pushed the Ice ever southward...
into the temperate zone toward Fire Keep.
And no one dared guess at the outcome...
of a meeting on the field of battle...
between Fire and Ice.
Hold your positions, men. Steady.
Lam, it cannot be stopped.
Join your brother.
You have done well, my son.
The North Village has fallen. We have won.
I want to thank you, Mother.
The Great Plain is all that stands between ourselves and Fire Keep.
That is a long distance.
A distance we may not have to travel.
I am sending our envoys to Jarol with our new demands.
- He will not submit.
- Perhaps.
You will present our demands to King Jarol at Fire Keep and... give our royal regards to his lovely daughter.
But, Father, I want to be with you when you meet Nekron's men.
You will serve your people better here with your studies, my daughter.
Give me your love.
You have it always, Father.
All matter in our world is from the natural bases... which are earth, air, fire and water.
The four elements from which all things are created.
How can you talk about elements when the war draws nearer to us ever hour?
Princess Teegra, we all have our duty.
Your father's duty is to be king and lead.
Your brother's duty is to soldier.
And your duty is to learn.
You mean my duty is to stay shut up... while all the men do the fighting and share all the glory.
We think that stinks.
Don't we, Shaitan?
If you peacefully surrender, my lord Nekron will cease the destruction of...
This is your message of peace?
A demand for our total and unconditional surrender?
We call it an offer of alliance, Your Majesty.
I call it blackmail.
My lord Nekron's offer...
To hell with Nekron and his offer.
We are free men, not slaves.
King Jarol, be reasonable.
My son, Taro, speaks more with his heart than with his head.
But he speaks for all of us.
There can be no alliance.
We will fight you to the death.
Perhaps, you will soon change your mind.
No!
Teegra!
Guards!
Make for the glacier. Man the Dragonhawks.
Hurry!
The Dragonhawks will find her, Father.
They've got to.
The night's so dark, the jungle so thick.
A bird couldn't find its own nest.
- What do we do then, Father?
- We wait.
- For Nekron's new demands?
- For his siege!
What is your report?
Have you done as I commanded?
Have you captured the girl, Teegra,
Jarol's daughter?
Where is she?
Bring her forth that I may see her.
- Gone.
- Gone?
Gone!
Escaped? You filth-spawned scum!
What punishment does failure demand?
Death.
Find the girl.
Find her, or his punishment shall be yours.
Gods of my father.
What do you want?
If you want it, take it.
I am not a thief.
Not so close, you'll burn it.
I've always lived close to a fire.
Sometimes in the night, I'm so afraid.
It's getting colder.
- Cold comes from Nekron.
- I know.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going home to my people.
- Where is home?
- Far away, to the south.
- I'm going south, too.
- Yeah?
You can come along if you behave yourself.
If I behave myself?
No.
Larn.
You've caught me, but you'll never hand me over to Nekron.
You'll have to kill me first.
Don't hunt for death, boy.
It finds us all soon enough.
The travois was to keep you from killing yourself till you're all healed.
You need rest and food.
If you're gonna kill the Ice Lord, boy, you better learn to live with pain.
Ice Lord? You mean you're fighting Nekron?
Him and his mother.
That wolf bitch, Juliana.
Teegra!
They were here.
Nekron's dogs, they got the girl.
They took her west.
Guard Teegra.
They camped less than two miles from here.
Come.
I saw the girl before.
She is on the far side of the big tree.
You go get her out, and I'll distract the others.
- There must be 50 of them.
- That sounds about right.
- Where's the girl?
- I couldn't find her.
- No!
- The horses!
No, they'd be on our heels before we could reach them.
- But Teegra's still back there.
- Then we'll come back for her.
First, we lead the Nekron's dogs on a wild chase.
Come.
We'll take our stand up there. Come.
Enough!
I want you to go to Nekron, to his mother, Juliana.
- We must negotiate.
- With the enemy?
No man is wholly evil.
Surely there is some way to appeal to Nekron.
You expect his mercy?
Father, do you know what he will do if I enter his land under a flag of truce?
We have no choice!
We must take that risk.
You must take that risk, my son, for the sake of Fire Keep.
For the sake of your sister.
Go, ride swiftly.
Welcome to my hearth.
I am Roliel and these woods are my home.
You've had a trying journey.
Please let me give you some food and drink.
First, you shall rest. Then we will talk.
Poor, poor darling.
Did Great Otwa frighten you?
You mustn't be afraid.
He's as gentle as a child.
I saw him twist a chain apart with his bare hands.
Yes, he is strong, my sweet.
But he means well, my darling.
He brought you to me, did he not?
I'm so tired.
Yes, my poor, poor darling.
Yes, you're so tired... and so beautiful.
You must...
Tell me your secrets.
Nekron?
The girl is wanted by Nekron? The bitch!
She brings danger into my house!
Perhaps I can turn this to my advantage.
Otwa, my son.
Go and bring the subhumans,
Nekron's dogs.
Tell them we have the girl that he wants.
Tell them he can have her, for a price.
Kill.
Get out of here.
- No.
- The hell you won't.
Go find the girl.
Enter, my son. It is not barred.
What's wrong with you?
Where are the dogs?
You would do this...
Why do the living... disturb the sleep of the dead?
I followed a trail. I seek a girl, Teegra.
A girl?
Yes. She did this to me.
She and Nekron.
Cursed Nekron.
Where can I find her?
- Why should I answer?
- For revenge against Nekron.
Nekron?
Akatar. They take her to Akatar.
And from there to the Icy King's realm.
Avenge me.
Avenge me!
Akatar.
Teegra!
My Prince, all is arranged.
I've hired a ship. It waits for us at the dock.
Nekron waits at Ice Peak.
Get the gangplanks aboard.
Move, you scum!
We must be well on our way before sunrise.
Why have you brought me this?
This is your bride, my son.
She will be mother to your sons.
How thoughtful, Mother.
I need no bride, and no sons.
- But you need heirs.
- I need nothing!
Nekron?
Nekron, you're a great power in the world.
You have all that any man ever wants or needed.
And yet you despair.
For there is one thing you lack.
One gift that only you can bestow between our people.
Peace.
This is the gift that heals the heart of the giver.
Nekron, I extend my hand in friendship.
I offer peace between our people.
Will you not take my hand?
Will you not call me friend?
Woman...
I spit on peace.
I spit on you.
Next time you present me with one of your little sluts, Mother dear...
I'll squash you like a bug.
Get that garbage out of here.
Don't look up.
We are riders of Fire Keep.
We pay no heed to such trash.
We have come, Lord Nekron, to negotiate between our two peoples.
And the return to Fire Keep of my sister, Teegra... whom your warriors basely kidnapped.
My father, King Jarol, has empowered me... to offer a peace between our kingdoms... in exchange for his continued sovereignty... and my sister's freedom.
It seems to me that my envoys made a similar offer not long since... and that it was spurned by your illustrious sire.
You know full well, Nekron, that offer was made... before your minions kidnapped my sister.
I fear, Good Prince,
I cannot offer peace to a people... who have refused to proclaim me their rightful overlord.
As to your sister...
I must admit that until this moment... the idea of mating with her filled me with loathing.
Perhaps I should reconsider.
Your sister, after all, is not wholly unattractive.
As lesser beasts go.
Pig you are.
And like a pig shall you die.
No!
No, I don't think so.
You interest me.
Guards!
Bring him to me.
Release him.
- Why have you come seeking me?
- You killed my people.
We've had to dispose of so many undesirables of late.
Let him rest. There is still fight in him.
Larn.
Teegra, is that you?
- Teegra, are you all right?
- Yes. I'm trying to unlock the door.
Never mind the door, you've to get out of here.
I'm not leaving without you.
Maybe I can get a key somehow.
No, Teegra, don't.
Is he certain?
- It was my son you saw?
- They called him Prince Taro.
He died.
- What about Teegra?
- He's got her, too.
Maybe she's still alive.
It's a chance.
Believe what you want, but that glacier is a fact.
For three days and nights it's been pushing south.
A thousand souls lost because of Nekron's rage.
Fire Keep is next. We must attack.
I need the Dragonhawks.
- The Dragonhawks are too few.
- Enough to get in with.
One us might get through and destroy him.
But if that glacier passes beyond the river,
I will have no choice.
I will have to release the lava.
Teegra.
Larn.
Nekron!
Die! Die! Why don't you die?
No, Larn! No, it's over, don't you see?
We have to start over.
I think this house will be exactly right for you.
That's what she said about all the wrong ones she showed us yesterday!
Isn't it rather isolated?
Well, secluded, I'd say.
- Are you sure it wasn't $1,000 a week?
- Quite sure.
- Furnished?
- Indeed.
- What's the catch?
- Catch, Mr Curtis?
A bargain like that wouldn't stay on the market.
Maybe there's a ghost.
What self-respecting English house would be without one?
Nonsense. The fact is Mrs Aylwood, the owner, is a bit eccentric.
She has no family left and she needs the income, but she is quite sentimental about the house and picky about who lives in it.
Look around.
I'll nip to the cottage for the keys.
- Is someone living there?
- Mrs Aylwood.
I expect that's why she wants to make sure the tenants are the right sort of people.
If we live here, I'm gonna climb this and go exploring in those woods.
Leave a trail of pebbles so I can grab you before the wicked witch eats you up.
If she lives in a gingerbread house,
I'll eat it up. I'm starved!
- What is it?
- Mrs Aylwood.
- I've brought a lovely family to...
- You were told to notify me first.
- I tried to reach you by telephone.
- I haven't left the house all day.
Mrs Curtis writes charming children's books, and Mrs Curtis is quite well-known in American musical circles.
Pianist and composer. He's here to conduct one of his own operas.
Mrs Aylwood, are you all right?
I'll get the keys.
They don't build houses like this any more.
What we need is a little light.
There's a large dining room and the kitchen has full butler's pantry.
The living room is just beyond the music room. This way.
That's a bit more cheery, isn't it?
How long before lunch?
You just had breakfast an hour ago.
When you said opera,
I thought he was a serious musician.
I have a very soft touch late at night.
Come on, Jan. Let's go upstairs.
I want that room. It's really neat, and you can look right out at the woods.
Did you hurt yourself?
It's just a little cut.
I thought...
I thought I saw something out there in the woods.
What sort of person are you?
It's hard to say. Just... average, I guess.
Are you adventurous... and kind?
Are you kind?
I... try to be.
And sensitive?
Do you sense things?
Mrs Aylwood, my husband would like to talk about the details of the lease.
That is, if you've decided to let us live here.
I'm going to take a chance on you.
Isn't this a pretty room?
- What was all that about?
- I don't know.
What happened to your hand?
I cut it on that window.
Let's see.
- Mom?
- What, darling?
- Couldn't we keep looking?
- This place has everything we need.
- And the price is right. Why don't you like it?
- I don't know.
The whole atmosphere, I guess.
I had such a funny, cold feeling out by the woods.
Like someone was watching me.
And then there's Mrs Aylwood... and this house.
Older people, when they live alone, tend to be a bit unusual.
Something awful happened here.
I can feel it.
Something awful.
Boy, Mrs Aylwood sure is creepy.
Comforting to know we're the right sort of people.
I've seen the iciest of old ladies melted by your charm.
- I think your daughter did the trick.
- Me?
No, dear, not you.
She had a daughter, about your age.
- Had?
- Lost, many years ago.
- Perhaps you reminded Mrs Aylwood of her.
- Lost how?
I really don't know all the details, just that she disappeared.
I believe the circumstances were rather tragic.
She's going to stay here.
Is that what you wanted?
Let's see. Gooseneck lamp up here with the rest of my writing things, mirror in the living room, please.
- Jan, you didn't!
- I don't know what happened.
I wasn't even touching it!
Mom, I couldn't see myself in it.
My reflection wasn't in it.
What?
I couldn't see myself in the mirror.
And then I saw...
I thought I saw... somebody else in it.
You know how old mirrors are. I never made a move without something getting broken.
That's seven years' bad luck.
Nonsense. I broke a mirror the day I met your mother.
I'm not sure that makes your point, darling.
It's OK, Dad, I'll get it.
Well, be careful.
Boo!
- Boy, are you ever jumpy!
- Brat!
Look out! You'll wreck the scariest mask
I ever had! I may want to use it on you again.
- Out!
- Some people are no fun at all.
What is going on?
You are supposed to be in bed.
- I was just attacked by that thing.
- Even monsters have to sleep.
Here. Give us a kiss.
- Goodnight.
- 'Night.
Goodnight.
- Sweet dreams.
- You, too.
Mom, will you catch the light?
I'm through reading.
Door.
Must open door.
Door.
Must open door.
Ellie? Ellie, wake up. It's OK.
Ellie, wake up. You were dreaming.
Talking in your sleep. It's OK.
- I wasn't talking. You were.
- No, I wasn't.
Well, you're the only one here.
Who else could it have been?
Jan, can I come into bed with you?
Sure. Then if we talk in our sleep, we won't wake each other up. Make sense?
No, but I'm coming anyways.
I'll bring Arthur. He'll watch out for us.
Elephants hardly ever sleep, you know.
Mike, you were right.
This one chose me, so I'd better not hurt its feelings.
It came right away from the mother.
That means she's brave, huh?
- What are you gonna call her?
- I'm not sure. I've gotta think.
She's special, so it's gotta be a special name.
What's that?
The name of the puppy: Nerak!
- But what does it mean?
- You oughta know. You whispered it to me.
- I was talking to Mike.
- Well, I heard somebody say it.
I've never seen you write like that.
Ring up and Mike will deliver what you need.
That's marvellous. When I'm working, it's hard to tear myself away from the typewriter.
He can pick things up for you in the village.
He's a good lad, my Mike.
My strong right arm since his dad died.
I wanted him to stay at college, but...
Mrs Fleming? What's wrong?
Nothing. I... I just remembered
I left something cooking. Excuse me.
Look, Mom! Isn't she beautiful?
Her name's Nerak.
We've never known a Karen.
Look, this may not be any of my business.
You want to talk about it?
Jan, we're ready to go now.
I can't. Not now, anyway.
Karen!
Come on, Nerak! Come on.
Come here, Nerak. Come on!
Come on.
Come on, Nerak! Come on.
Come on, come on!
Come on. Come on.
No!
Come on, come on. Come here, Nerak.
- Bye!
- Bye!
Ellie?
Ellie?
Ellie?
Ellie?
Ellie, can you hear me?
Ellie!
Ellie, please!
Ellie, why didn't you answer when I called you?
I didn't hear you. And you shouldn't sneak up like that. You scared me.
- I was yelling myself hoarse!
- I didn't hear.
- I asked you not to come into the woods!
- I had to. Nerak ran off.
If I hadn't come after her, she would have gotten lost.
Isn't this a pretty place?
Yeah.
Yes, it is.
- That's a happy song.
- What?
The song you were just humming.
I wasn't humming anything.
Come here, Nerak.
- Did you see that?
- See what?
All I can see is this vicious animal trying to smother me!
- We should head back.
- Tell that to Nerak.
- I mean it! Now!
- Come back, you little...
Jan!
- No!
- Let go of me!
- Stop! You're drowning her!
- Let me go!
- Stop!
- Get out of my way!
She had to. She had to push you down to get you loose from the branch.
She saved your life.
- I thought she was trying to drown you.
- Ellie...
Go and fetch some dry clothes for your sister.
Yes, ma'am. Come on, Nerak.
Dry your hair or you'll take a chill.
I don't know how to thank you for saving me.
What kind of name is that? Nerak?
Ellie just made that up.
It's the name Karen spelled backwards.
What is it? What's wrong?
That was my daughter's name. Karen.
Mrs Thayer told us you'd lost your daughter. I'm sorry.
Drink this.
- Mrs Aylwood?
- Yes?
Was anything wrong with Karen's eyes?
Why do you ask?
The night she disappeared... was she blindfolded?
How do you know about the blindfold?
You asked me once if I sensed things.
Well, I have. And Ellie's been hearing things.
It's like someone is watching us.
- And the day we moved in, I saw something.
- What?
An image in a mirror.
A girl... about my age... with long blonde hair.
And she was blindfolded.
- You saw her?
- I'm not sure.
Could you...
Could you tell me what happened?
How she disappeared?
My husband was killed in the war.
And Karen was everything to me.
She was soon to be 17, and I stayed up late... finishing her present.
Karen wasn't in her room.
She was always so considerate,
I couldn't believe she'd gone off without telling me.
Then I remembered there was an eclipse.
She might have gone to watch it at the pond.
Karen?
Karen, where are you?
Mary! John!
Tom? Tom Colley!
Karen?
Karen!
Karen!
They searched the ruins... but there was no sign of Karen.
No sign at all.
Didn't the other kids know what happened to her?
Why was she blindfolded?
They said it was part of a game.
They used to meet in the chapel.
Sometimes there seems to be something out there.
Sometimes... I hear someone whispering in the wind.
Mrs Aylwood, what do you think happened to Karen?
I think she's still out there.
- What nonsense.
- I told you there was a ghost.
As long as it keeps out of the house,
I can live with it.
For heaven's sake! I knew Mrs Aylwood was strange, but this is ridiculous.
I did see something in the mist at the pond.
That's why I fell in.
We'll always be grateful to her for saving you, but I won't have her filling your head with these far-fetched fantasies.
Excuse me.
- I'll catch you later. I want to watch Mike.
- OK.
She seems less moody today.
This is what she needs. It'll do her good.
Knight on shining motorcycle.
- How many sandwiches do we have?
- Four for me and one for you!
Come on!
Come on, Mike!
- Hi, guys!
- Hi.
Grab a sandwich before your sister eats them all.
Ellie, let's get closer.
Well, be careful now.
- There he is!
- There's Mike!
Jan! Come quick!
What is it?
Quickly!
Jan, quickly!
Wow! Did you see that?
- What did you want?
- I didn't want you. Nerak did.
- It's lucky you moved off that rock.
- It wasn't luck.
- What do you mean?
- It's nothing. Forget it.
- It's just been a crazy kind of week all round.
- Do you want to talk about it?
Mrs Aylwood told me that Karen, her daughter, disappeared years ago, when she was about my age, and was never seen again.
If Karen was murdered, that would explain her haunting the woods, wouldn't it?
Mrs Aylwood said there were three kids with Karen that night.
One was John Keller, and there was a Tom something. Collier?
Tom Colley. He lives in the woods in the old lodge. Kind of a hermit.
And there was a girl. Mary... Mary Pierce.
- Mary Pierce?
- Yeah.
That was my mother's name before she married Dad.
It was a long time ago. It's best forgotten.
- How come you never told me?
- It happened years before you were born.
I remember your dad saying it's important to live in the present and leave the past.
There's something about those woods that bothers you.
You never go near them, not even to take the short cut to the village.
Across that rickety old bridge?
I should say not.
Mum, what do you think really happened to Karen Aylwood?
I think she ran away from home.
I don't know why she did, but it's the only logical explanation.
What were the four of you doing?
We were just... just larking about.
It was John Keller's idea.
It was... just a game.
Then there was a... sudden summer storm.
Lightning struck the belfry.
The whole thing was aflame.
We ran out.
At least... three of us did.
I've never been back to that place again.
Look what Daddy made me to watch the eclipse on Saturday.
- I can show you how to make one.
- Not now. Mike's taking us riding.
I'll get ready.
- Mom said she'd only be a minute.
- That means ten.
- I wish you didn't have to go.
- So do I.
But if I don't, singers, dancers and musicians will be unemployed.
- Jan, I'll be back in time for supper.
- OK.
- See if you can find some peanut butter.
- Crunchy or smooth?
- Smooth!
- Crunchy!
OK, I'll handle it. Have a good ride.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye!
- Bye!
Good riding, Ellie. Ride ahead and make sure the path's clear of Indians.
It gets me out of the way so you two can be alone, doesn't it? See you.
Come on. Come on, Snowball. Let's go.
I tried to talk to Mum about Karen.
She was very evasive.
She really didn't want to talk about it at all.
Come on, you guys. Hurry up!
Let go back through the woods.
- No, Mike, I don't think we should.
- Oh, come on!
Help! Help me!
Help! Mike, help!
- Stop, Snowball!
- Hang on!
Cocoa! Help!
Mike! Help!
Stop! Cocoa, stop!
Cocoa!
Anybody there?
Is anyone in there?
Mike!
Are you OK?
- That man!
- It was Tom Colley. He didn't hurt you?
I saw Karen's face again!
In the chapel. In a coffin!
It's only a reflection.
It couldn't have been my reflection.
I wasn't standing here.
I was back there. It was Karen, her image.
She was lying in that coffin as if she were dead.
I think I was sent here for a reason.
You were on a runaway horse.
He could have bolted in any direction.
He bolted because something in the woods spooked him.
Don't build it up into a...
Mike!
What made the windows break?
The wind. It just came blasting through the chapel.
But there wasn't any wind outside.
Overlapping circles. What does it mean?
- Can't we go now, Jan?
- Sure we can, Ellie. Come on, Jan.
Mike. There was a shadow of a triangle on this coffin when I came in.
The same triangle that's on the window in my bedroom.
These circles, they must mean something.
There was a circle on the water at the pond, too.
It was strange.
I've seen her, Mr Keller.
As God's my witness, I've seen her.
- She was in the chapel, she was.
- You're drunk.
Not then, I wasn't.
She was there, I tell you.
She come in and went right to the coffin and looked inside.
- That's impossible.
- Listen!
It's thundering.
There was thunder and lightning that other night. The night we...
Now, I've told you never to talk about that night!
All that time gone by, and her looking like it was yesterday it happened.
- How could that be?
- Get hold of yourself, man!
It's been nearly 30 years.
Now, none of us could look the same, could we?
There.
What was it I seen, then?
Has she come back from the grave to haunt us for what we done, Mr Keller?
Is it the ghost of Karen I seen?
Works every time!
We should bring Ellie.
It might curb her appetite.
- What took you so long?
- I saw her again.
- What are you talking about?
- In the mirrors.
She was reaching out, begging me, pleading with me to help her.
- She's trapped and needs my help.
- Oh, come on, Jan!
- It means something, Mike.
- You're not making sense.
There's something I've got to do.
Maybe she wants me to find out what really happened that night.
- How?
- I don't know, but I've got to find out.
Stay!
Didn't you see the signs?
This is private property!
Mr Keller, I had to see you.
It's about Karen Aylwood.
- What about Karen Aylwood?
- She needs help.
- How would you know that?
- I've seen her.
- Where?
- In mirrors.
Mirrors. You see yourself as Karen?
No! It was her image!
Why was she blindfolded in the chapel?
I've gotta know what happened that night!
Why do you? You're a stranger here.
It's none of your business.
Don't you see? She needs my help.
She's trapped somewhere...
That's enough. I've better things to do than listen to hysterical fantasies.
What happened to Karen was a tragedy that touched us all, changed us all, but it's best forgotten!
- Have you ever forgotten?
- Get out of here!
- Mr Keller, please.
- I said, clear out.
Tom Colley?
Tom Colley?
Please, don't be angry.
I didn't mean to come inside.
I called but nobody answered!
- You ain't no ghost.
- I'm the girl you saw in the chapel.
You ain't Karen come back to haunt us.
Why would she do that?
Can't talk about that.
Mr Keller, he said not to.
Nasty poacher hurt its paw, but old Tom'll make it right.
Like he did for you, eh?
Nearly right now, ain't you?
Not like them poor little ones there.
When I finds 'em like that, dead,
I buries 'em.
Tom, was Karen dead when you found her?
Never found Karen. Looked and looked.
Here. Hold.
It won't hurt you none.
They know when you try to help.
- Karen needs your help, Tom.
- Needs me?
Yes, she needs you.
But Karen's gone.
- Tom, if you knew Karen was trapped...
- Awful things, traps. They hurt.
- You'd set her free, wouldn't you?
- If I could find her.
You don't have to, Tom. All you have to do is tell me what happened in the chapel.
Why did you blindfold her?
What was it you did?
You and Mary Pierce and John Keller?
Mr Keller said mustn't talk about that.
- Mary Pierce said you were playing a game.
- She said?
Yes, Tom. What kind of game?
Ring Round the Roses, it was.
Never meant to harm Karen.
Loved Karen. Wouldn't ever hurt her.
There was three of us.
Me and Mary made our way to the secret meeting place, the old chapel.
We had blindfolded Karen.
That was what John Keller had told us to do.
She was the new one, you see.
John Keller was already in there.
You have been brought to this place to prove yourself worthy of our secret society.
We number only three. We alone have passed this test of courage.
Many have tried and failed.
Once we link hands, you must not show fear, you must not speak, you must not remove the blindfold, you must not move at all.
We shall hold hands around you and you must not break the circle of our friendship.
Whatever happens, whatever we say or do, you must abide by our code.
Banish all thoughts from your mind.
Do you understand?
Let us join hands...
...and concentrate.
Mary Pierce, Tom Colley and I, John Keller, we are looking upon you, Karen Aylwood, willing you to be as one with us.
We ask the question, is this person worthy...
She wasn't there any more.
When the bell come down, she was gone already.
- Are you sure?
- I told 'em what I seen.
"Where could she have gone?" they says.
There was no other way out.
And they looked and looked... and never found nothin'.
Tom...
Nice to me, she was.
So nice.
She was my friend.
Ellie.
Where'd you hear that song?
From Jan. She was humming it at the pond the day she fell in the water.
Come in, child. There's something
I want to show you. I think you'll like it.
- My mother said I was never to bother you.
- It's no bother.
Come on. I was just about to have some tea and cakes.
OK!
This belonged to my daughter.
I gave it to her on her fifth birthday.
She loved it.
She played it at night before she went to sleep.
It's the same tune you heard at the pond.
Listen.
Your sister tells me you hear... other things.
Voices that tell you to... do things?
I was just dreaming.
Not when you named Nerak.
She named herself.
Listen, child. Listen to the music.
See if you can hear that voice again.
- Mrs Aylwood.
- Hi, Jan.
Look at the music box. Isn't it pretty?
In a minute, Ellie. I've something to tell
Mrs Aylwood. I just came from Tom Colley's.
He said it was some kind of initiation ceremony.
He said there was a flash of light, just like you saw, but when the bell crashed,
Karen was already gone.
There was no other way out.
That's what Tom Colley said.
The bell crashed. Karen was already gone.
Karen. Must help Karen.
Must help.
No! We must listen.
How can we help Karen?
Door. Must open door.
- What door? Where?
- Chapel.
Soon! Very soon! Help Karen very soon!
Karen, tell us how.
No, not Karen, but need help.
- If you're not Karen, who are you?
- Tell me what to do, Karen, please!
No! Not Karen!
Stupid, stupid, stupid!
- Who are you?
- Ellie!
- What have you done to her?
- It just happened.
I didn't want to hurt Ellie! I love her!
Mom?
Mom...
It's all right, baby.
Everything is gonna be all right now.
I'm taking you out of here. I'm taking both of you away from here tonight.
No! You can't. Not now, Mom!
It's not Karen outside there.
Don't you understand? It's someone else!
You get your things ready.
We're leaving here right now.
- What's happening?
- I don't know.
- The battery's shorting.
- It's trying to stop us.
Nothing's trying to stop us.
- We must go back.
- Don't be ridiculous.
- If we go back, they'll start again!
- Jan, stop it. Just stop it!
- What are you doing?
- We have to get off the bridge!
Come on! Get out!
- Enough of this hysteria! Give me the keys!
- I can't!
Sorry she made you angry.
You're not Karen. I know that.
I don't know who you are, but, please, leave my little sister alone.
- Stop that.
- Mom, I can't. I can't stop!
There's something I've got to do, or Ellie and I'll go on being haunted!
Whatever is out there won't tell me what it wants!
Stop it this minute!
Mom, I'm scared.
Whatever it is out there, it's not going to use you, either of you.
Not Karen!
We've got to hurry!
Nearly too late.
- Hardly ever happens.
- What hardly ever happens?
Ellie, you said it hardly ever happens.
What does it mean?
I don't know, Jan.
I can't remember.
"Do again tomorrow."
Do what?
I don't know.
I'm scared.
Good, you're up. Mom said not to wake you.
Seen my thing to watch the eclipse?
No.
Dad says you can't look straight at the sun or it'll ruin your eyes.
- I hope he gets here in time to see it.
- Daddy's coming?
Mom called him.
Help me look, Jan. It's nearly too late.
Nearly too late.
Here it is!
That's funny. I looked in there before.
We can all take turns using it.
It hardly ever happens.
Hardly ever happens.
- What hardly ever happens?
- I just told you. The eclipse.
There are lots of moon eclipses, but a sun eclipse is special.
What time does it start?
12.30. Oh, rats!
When Mike did this, it came out elephants, not Ring Around the Rosey!
Ring Round the Roses, it was.
What's wrong?
Nothing. Tell Mom I'm going back to sleep.
- Hello?
- You gotta do something for me!
- Jan, what's wrong?
- I think I know what those circles meant.
- The overlapping ones meant an eclipse.
- There's an eclipse today.
And the circle at the pond meant a circle of people.
I can't explain it all, but I have to get Keller, Tom and your mom to the chapel now before the eclipse.
I need your help. Tell her anything.
Say it's a matter of life or death.
Jan?
Where are you going?
I'm going to the chapel with John Keller,
Tom Colley and Mary Fleming.
I want them to repeat the ceremony they held, linking hands, like in a seance when people make objects move.
- I think that's what happened to Karen...
- No! You mustn't do that!
Whatever happened to my Karen could happen to you.
Mrs Aylwood, I have to do it.
Whatever is haunting Ellie and me will never leave us alone.
God be with you, child.
- Karen Aylwood's dead!
- How do you know that?
She never would have put her mother through suffering!
Part of the suffering is not knowing.
Maybe we can find out what happened, how she disappeared before the bell fell, or how she died, if she died.
I told you before, it's none of your business.
Mr Keller, it was your idea, wasn't it?
The secret society?
The initiation ceremony?
Don't you wanna know the truth?
Who do you think you are to disrupt lives and reopen old wounds?
They never really healed, did they?
Isn't that why you lock yourself away in that dreary house, a prisoner of your own guilt?
Mr Keller, I don't have much time.
But you owe it to Karen and you owe it to yourself to try to help make this happen.
- They should have been here by now.
- They won't come. Not back to this place.
But they are! They're coming!
Nerak, look...
Nerak, get over here!
Nerak! Come back!
- I can't.
- You must.
We're running out of time.
We can't waste it arguing.
It may not work, Mrs Fleming, but we must try!
We have to repeat the ceremony.
No. No!
Whatever happened 30 years ago was during an eclipse.
The same thing's happening now, so maybe we can bring her back.
Nerak!
Nerak!
Nerak!
Nerak!
Nerak!
Nerak!
Nerak.
Don't do it. When Karen did it, something went wrong. She was never seen again.
The circle won't be broken this time.
No, no, no! We ran away once before and we've regretted it ever since.
- We must not run out again!
- The blindfold.
Mr Keller, I have to know exactly what you said and did that night.
- I told Karen...
- To me, Mr Keller. I'm Karen now.
- Say it to me!
- Very well.
Once we link hands, you must not show fear, you must not speak, you must not remove the blindfold, you must not move at all.
We shall hold hands and you must not break our circle of friendship.
- If anything happens to Jan, I'll break it.
- Don't interfere! Move away!
We are looking upon you, Karen Aylwood, willing you to be as one with us.
We ask the question: is this person worthy?
Listen.
Ready to return.
I have been trapped on your planet.
Karen was my intervention.
We exchanged places by mistake.
Magnetic pull of the eclipse
transferred our positions.
Now exchange places again.
- Almost time.
- Ellie!
I must return home.
Where's home?
What happened to Karen?
Continue. Continue.
My power comes from you,
the three linked as before,
when darkness comes at noon.
- The eclipse.
- It's almost time. Hurry.
Go on with the ceremony, Mr Keller!
We've gotta beat the eclipse.
Come on!
We shall hold hands around you.
You must not break our circle of friendship.
With joined hands, we call upon the powers of the universe to grant us...
This is our chance!
Don't break the circle!
Mary. Give me your hand!
Must return home.
Time's running out. Hurry.
- Hurry.
- But where is Karen?
Karen was in the way.
Mistake. Transferred by mistake.
In error we exchanged places.
Karen's still in my dimension.
Trapped and suspended.
Must reverse the process.
Concentrate.
Exchange persons again. Transfer back.
Now. Later too late.
Now.
Now. Now.
- It's taking me!
- Jan, you have to get out of that!
I can't!
Jan, move! Move!
Break the ring! Break it!
It's Karen.
We brought her back!
Jan.
Karen.
You're home.
Lower away!
Lowering!
Easy as it goes, lads!
- Boats down, captain.
- Very good, sir.
Shore party, stand by to board!
Shore party ready.
Over the side then.
There you go, men.
You heard the captain, lads.
Cast off!
Lo you now of days long past, of a time when the world was young, when sorcery thrived and wild adventure was forever in the offing.
And of this epoch, little is known, save that which is veiled in the mists of legendry.
It is within these mists that our tale begins on tomb island, a rocky crag perched at the far edge of the world.
We're not to be disturbed.
- Wait for us at the boats.
- Yes, your majesty.
Get on with it, witch!
A sword…
Look!
It lives!
Rise.
Who art thou?
Titus Cromwell, king of Aragon.
What is wished of me?
We need your help in conquering Ehdan.
It's the richest kingdom in the world, and I want it.
Why dost thou crave my services?
Thou art a king with an army.
Four times I've been defeated by king Richard of Ehdan, but with your help
I will be victorious.
And what wouldst thou bestow upon me?
Your life is enough.
After all, how can we be sure a toad like you even has the power to aid us?
Oh, no, dark lord.
You are my master, my god!
As thou can see, my art is powerful.
I will allow you to live, as long as you serve me.
Betray me, and I will joyfully send you back to rot in hell,
Xusia of Delos.
Thou shalt have thy kingdom, and I,
I too shall have what should be mine.
A thousand leagues away, the wondrous kingdom of Ehdan was celebrating 20 years of peace and tranquility.
Once a haven for barbaric plunder,
Ehdan had been transformed into a prospering civilized nation by the wise and strong king Richard.
Richard.
Come, Richard.
We mustn't keep everyone waiting.
What troubles you?
The nightmares.
The dreams still haunt me.
What did Amilius tell you about them?
He said…
What he said was that it's too much of this kingly life.
Unbeknownst to them all,
Cromwell's armies, aided by Xusia's black sorcery, had already stormed across the borders of Ehdan, leaving behind a wake of ungodly death, disease and destruction.
King Richard is finished.
Half his army lay rotting before us.
We can now deal with the good king without the aid of a sorcerer.
Besides, if we don't kill Xusia now while he's still weak from his conjuring, we might never be rid of him.
Cromwell?
Thou has sent for me?
Why, behold our hero.
Get to the point.
I'm weary.
Well, then, you shall sleep… forever.
Even without Xusia's sorcery,
Cromwell could not be stopped.
Only one army stood between him… and the city.
Tavis! My son.
Bring a leech!
Move!
Father.
No, don't talk.
Wait for the leech.
There is no time.
The eastern army has been destroyed.
Destroyed?
Father, it's black…
Tavis.
Tavis.
Oh!
Go. Roust Duncan.
He will ride with me.
The others I leave in your charge.
Take them and escape.
A boat awaits you on the river.
Go now.
Quickly, Malia.
Take me to battle, father.
You'll need me.
I do love you more than life itself.
If I die, it will fall upon you to avenge me.
Do you understand, Talon?
I understand.
And so it came to pass that the remnants of Richard's armies met
Cromwell's black hordes in a final desperate battle.
Here on the sea cliffs of Elizrah, the fate of Ehdan had been decided.
Talon.
Talon.
Mogullen.
Mogullen, where's my father?
Don't worry about the king.
The battle is lost, and we must save the queen.
Cromwell will be after her next.
Let's finish it.
Father!
No, Talon!
Listen to me.
Avenge your father another day.
Cromwell will try to stop your mother's escape on the river.
You must save her.
You hear?
The future of the kingdom is in your hands.
Now go.
Go!
Go! Go!
To the boat, children.
Henry, come back!
Henry!
You bastard!
No!
No.
Oh, no!
- Mama!
- No!
I'll spare your daughter, if you officially proclaim me king.
Never!
Pull it out!
Malia, you fool!
No!
Find that boy on your lives.
Don't return without him.
I want him.
I want him.
For years the boy was to be hunted, but Cromwell's assassins found not a trace.
Talon had simply vanished into the void.
Years passed, and rumors began to rumble through the outland kingdoms of a fearless adventurer, a warrior who roamed trackless deserts, mighty mountains and shining seas.
These rumors grew into legends about this man who was at once a buccaneer, a slave, a rogue, a general.
Talon!
Then, just days before the 11th anniversary of Cromwell's victory over king Richard, a band of mercenaries arrived on the outskirts of Ehdan.
- Why do we stop here, general?
- I have a debt to pay.
But, sir, king Lonbosha is waiting for us at Maladon.
He can wait.
Relax, Darius.
I hope this isn't a mistake, general.
Lonbosha might lose his kingdom while we're here.
Then we'll win it back.
Out of my way, witch.
I've been summoned.
I carry a message crucial to the final conflict.
I implore you to pardon this intrusion, lord and master.
Speak, dog.
Arrangements have been made to crush prince Mikah's rebellion and to deliver Alana to Cromwell for marriage.
For eight years,
I have been submerged in the black sleep to heal the wounds of Cromwell's treachery.
After I slept,
I conjured.
And now
I shall conquer.
In two days' time, with the rising of the seventh moon,
Cromwell's power,
Cromwell's bride and Cromwell's flesh shall be mine!
What do you want?
Your generals have gathered in the war room.
They await instructions on plans for the final conflict.
You handle it.
But, sire, it is imperative…
It is imperative that you obey my orders, if you wish to live.
Yes, my lord.
Tell Cromwell not to worry.
With him leading us, we will crush the rebellion and capture princess Alana, unless your information about the rebels proves false, count Machelli.
Take these orders, and return to your men, Rodrigo.
I will send word as to when our rebellion begins.
Yes, prince Mikah.
No animals allowed in here.
Hush, dog. Quiet.
You look like a thirsty lot.
- Bring us a bucket.
- A bucket, yes.
If you warriors are looking for work, you've come to the right place.
Why is that?
The people in Ehdan are about to rebel.
What kind of an animal are you?
I can't quite tell.
Here, you've had too much to drink.
Move on!
Go on.
As I was sayin'.
There are two bidders for your swords:
King Cromwell, the usurper, lord Mikah, the last legitimate heir to the throne.
What legitimate heir?
Mikah's father was king Richard's closest advisor.
The people believe him and his sister to be the rightful heirs.
All is set, Mikah.
Proceed as planned tomorrow.
Excellent, count.
Tomorrow the throne of Ehdan shall belong to you, its legitimate heir.
It's ironic that the people of Ehdan should owe their freedom to Cromwell's war chancellor.
They will owe me nothing, my friend.
Justice is its own reward.
- You're a good man, Machelli.
- I must go now.
You and I will have no further contact.
It is no longer safe.
Machelli, you will be well rewarded for this.
Thank you, your majesty.
Has my sister made it safely into the city?
Yes, my lord Mikah.
The princess Alana is waiting inside.
Alana!
Oh, it's good to see you, sister.
Oh, Mikah.
You're late.
Now come and have a look.
A map of the castle's secret passages.
Alana, how did you get this?
Cromwell's whore, Elizabeth, is partial to our cause.
She pilfered them from Cromwell himself.
With allies like these, how can we lose?
Yes, but what is he plotting?
He's got all the neighboring kings here and…
Shhh. It matters not.
I've just come from speaking with Machelli.
The rebellion begins tomorrow.
Spread the word.
Quickly now.
I can hardly believe it.
Tomorrow I shall be king.
- The crown will be yours.
- Yes.
But I'll not wear it, Alana.
The crown belongs to the people.
Cromwell.
What have we here?
A nest of cobras?
There's only one snake in Ehdan, Cromwell.
Is that you, Alana?
I was hoping you weren't a part of all this.
Go warn the others.
Your rebellion is over!
Take him.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
Now I poke you with my dagger, huh?
Not this time, slut!
You got lucky with me outside your den.
I'm gonna mount you like you've never been.
With what?
She's a wild one, this one.
Let's have a look at your goods.
No.
- My, what have we here?
- No!
Take her down.
No! No!
Beat it, pig, or die!
That's a small threat.
That's a very small threat.
Why, you scum!
Try that again!
Stop shaking.
You're safe now.
Milady.
Kalipa says your brother was captured by Cromwell himself.
We have to get the word out.
No attack tomorrow.
Right. This way.
In here, milady.
Dates? No beef?
As you wish.
Just a leg? Or shall
I bring the whole cow?
One leg will do.
Word is being passed.
You Edhanians know good wine.
I didn't bring you here to get drunk.
Well, why did you bring me here?
Is your sword for hire?
It depends.
I would pay anything for it.
Well, if the price is right, my sword is yours.
- Not so fast.
- Oh, but my sword is poised.
Nothing in life is free.
First, a task.
So what do you want?
A throat cut?
I want you to rescue my brother.
And what am I to be paid?
Two hundred talents.
That's not what
I had in mind.
Five hundred talents.
All right.
Anything you want, but only for one night.
So tell me, where is this brother of yours?
He's in Cromwell's dungeons.
You want me to snatch your brother from the king's dungeons for one night with you?
That's a slim bounty for such a task.
Why, you bastard!
All right.
The life of your brother for one night with you, but I expect my bounty perfumed and prettied.
Milady,
50 of our people have been trapped in skull cave by king Cromwell's red dragon archers.
Is there anything we can do to help them?
No, milady.
Nothin' can save them now.
We can't just sit by while they're being butchered!
What about you?
Can you help us?
What do you take me for?
- 'Tis suicide.
- Quiet, Craccus.
Risking his life is his profession.
Risk, not throw away.
What's the matter?
Is your sword too small?
And what am I to be paid for this small chore?
You're being paid enough for 1,000 such tasks.
Oh, I can't wait to bed you, wench.
You raise my expectation.
I'll rescue your rogues.
But first I want a taste of your lips to send me to my grave.
Brash hulk.
Who is he?
I don't know.
Well, at least you won't have to pay your debt.
He won't live to see the sun rise.
Out the back, milady!
Quick!
Come out and live or stay and die.
The choice is yours.
You have five minutes to decide.
Come, lads!
Your rebellion is over!
The king has your leader in chains!
Give yourselves up!
You heard the jackal.
Do we fight or surrender?
Oil!
They're pouring oil!
Get back there, scum!
Stand by for torching!
Arrows set!
All eyes on the cave!
Not a single rebel is to escape!
This is your final chance!
Surrender or roast!
Ready?
Take aim!
Fire!
Everyone has come to recognize him as the true heir.
With the prince captured,
I guess his sister Alana is the rightful heir.
It's all a bit muddled.
We farmers tend to stay out of such affairs.
How do you plan to rescue lord Mikah, warrior?
Just get me into the castle, and I'll think of something.
This will lead us into the castle?
According to this map, it will lead us right into the dungeons.
Light me a torch.
Give me a hand with this.
Now is that any way to treat your husband-to-be?
You're right, Titus.
Take me, my lord.
Oh, Titus.
Tonight you will be my queen, and soon the queen of the entire world.
And I will make love to you like no other can.
With what?
Love or not, you will be my queen.
Nothing can force me to marry you.
Not even the life of your brother?
Your majesty.
Your majesty.
Elizabeth, this is no place for you.
I've brought you some food and wine.
You've labored long.
I thought you'd be hungry.
Hungry, indeed, but not for food.
Dear Elizabeth, your new life as my consort suits you fine.
I was meant to be yours, my king.
Leave us, verdugo.
So, prince, are you going to tell me where Xusia is?
What are you talking about?
Oh, Mikah!
How else could this rabble uprising grow thus far?
Xusia must be behind it.
He's the only one who could truly challenge me.
You're being challenged by a myth.
Xusia of Delos died a thousand years ago.
I, myself, raised Xusia from the dead.
Little did I know what I let loose upon the world.
A wild tale.
It's no tale.
I've stalked Xusia for ten years, watching for signs of his devilish work.
He's using you as a pawn to gain control of my kingdom.
Your kingdom?
Nothing you call yours is truly yours, Cromwell.
My god, man, there is a demon in our midst, and he is the leader of your cause.
Now you tell us where he is and save us all.
I am the only leader of this rebellion.
Very well.
There must be someone.
- A mentor, an advisor perhaps.
- There is no one.
He may not look like a demon.
In human form, he could look like anyone.
But there'd be traces of a serpent in his face, wildness of a jackal in his eyes.
You're mad.
Perhaps.
What's the matter?
I'm too old for this.
Come on.
I'll help you.
I can't take another step.
I'm not leaving you here.
Go on. Save yourself.
I'll carry you.
Come on.
Over here. Come on.
Let's go over here.
Is this the only way into the dungeons?
Yes, my lord.
Don't call me that.
What a place.
How much further is it?
A hidden entrance into the dungeon is only a little further.
What is it?
What do you hear?
Is someone… listen.
Move!
You go first, warrior.
Perhaps we should wait for you here… to guard the escape.
You do that.
Quiet.
You want to get us caught?
There are guards everywhere.
Rodrigo.
Where are you going?
Stop, or your leader dies.
My luck rots.
Blast!
Get the door, governor.
Throw back the bolt.
Warrior?
It's me, Rodrigo.
What the devil are you doing here?
Cromwell's men were waiting for us at the sewer opening.
They intend to crucify us during tomorrow's feast.
I should let them.
Teach you a lesson.
Free everyone.
- Which one of these cells holds Mikah?
- None.
They took him to
Cromwell's torture chamber.
Poor Mikah.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, get up.
You're not animals to grovel.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
Who are you?
My name is Estard Devereux.
I was once
Cromwell's architect.
After I built this castle, the king had me imprisoned.
- You built this place?
- Oh, yes.
They threw me in here five years ago to ensure that the castle's secrets would never be revealed.
What secrets?
Oh, hidden passages, secret exits and more.
More.
- I want you to tell me all you know.
- Oh, I will. I will.
Sire, the dungeon guards are dead and the prisoners are gone.
- Elizabeth, you wait here.
- No.
Trust me.
Kill everyone in the chamber now.
An angel.
Hush.
Save your strength.
Use it or put it away.
You did it.
What did you expect?
I owe you one, my friend.
No, your sister owes me.
Now go before it's too late.
Come on.
Thank you.
Well, get going!
I'll stay.
We get out together, or we die together.
Well, come on then.
There they are!
Come on! Out of the way!
Get out of the way!
I'd love to stay, but…
Come here!
Come on! This way!
- Who dies first?
- I'll be the first.
Don't act as if you don't know who I am, Xusia.
It's your old friend,
Cromwell.
Now we'll see how a sorcerer fares… against cold steel.
I'm no sorcerer, but I'll gladly test your steel, old friend.
He's mine!
After him!
Don't let him get away!
You!
How dare you intercede!
Please, forgive me, your majesty, but it is a mistake to play with Xusia this way.
This man's no sorcerer!
Please do not be fooled by this ploy.
Xusia's cunning knows no bounds.
Have you forgotten what this man has done to your red dragons?
He must be one of Xusia's demons.
Forgive me.
I mean no disrespect, Your majesty.
I live only to serve the greater glory of your name.
Indeed, Machelli.
Indeed.
Fine duel.
Pity we won't learn who's the better.
Easy, my lord, the wounds must be cleansed.
Rodrigo.
Yes, my prince.
What happened to Alana?
She is to be married to Cromwell tonight.
Like hell.
And the warrior is to be crucified.
I should have helped him.
Tonight… rally our men.
We will crush Cromwell or die.
Go back into the castle?
Well, how else?
Coming in, old man?
Darius!
Darius.
Well, did you find him?
- Aye. King has him in chains.
- Good god!
What did he do now?
Have at one of the king's sluts?
It's not clear, but they mean to execute him tonight.
Damn. Go!
Roust the men from the house.
Check the ale shop for stragglers.
Move!
I fear we can't get to him, Darius.
- There must be a way into the castle.
- We might all perish.
Damn you, Phillip, then we all die.
Many a time Talon has saved our skins, or have you forgotten?
I just think we need more men.
You got'em!
Who are you?
Captain Morgan, an old cohort of Talon's.
How many are you?
We number only 20, surely not enough to aid you.
Blast you, Erik.
Spread the word of Talon's plight.
Half the sea dogs in this port owe their lives to him. Now, go!
See, Phillip, you have so little faith.
Now gather the men!
Myra! Myra, look.
Look who's just returned.
Oh, Elizabeth!
- But has Cromwell set you free?
- No, I was saved.
- By whom?
- I know not, but he risked all for me.
This savior, did he have a gauntlet of steel?
Why, yes.
Do you know him?
Aye, all too well.
Damn his heart.
He goes out for a joint of beef and ends up rescuing a king's wench.
- Now it falls to us to fetch him.
- He's been captured?
The lad will be crucified tonight.
We can't let him die for us.
- We must save him!
- We will.
Let me go with you.
- I know the way into the castle.
- Tell me the way.
I beg you, let me lead you to him.
To the sword then.
We should never have followed that bitch in here.
Quiet, barnacle!
It was those landlubbers that brought us into this trap.
Shut your mouth, sea dog, before I take this chain and wrap it around your neck till your lousy head falls off.
If these bars weren't between us, you'd be swimming in your own gizzards.
When we get out of here,
I intend to settle this.
I'll meet you, scum, anywhere you choose.
Enough!
Enough, or I'll skin all of you!
What's on your mind, potato head?
Cromwell sends you a bargain out of the goodness of his heart.
Ha! Cromwell's goodness?
Silence, you black dog!
Now, tell me who sent you to invade this castle, and I'll be merciful.
Bring them in!
These two had nothing to say, so I cut out their tongues.
Now speak, while you still have yours.
Tell me who sent you here, or I'll skin her before your very eyes.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Rat!
I hear the four kings have arrived with 1,000 knights.
But only two will be allowed to accompany each king to the feast.
Once we have assassinated the kings and lords, and Cromwell has exchanged his vows with Alana, we can send out armies to sweep across the continent to consolidate our power.
With the rebellion crushed, no one can stop us.
Where's Cromwell?
He is preoccupied.
He has given me charge of his army until further notice.
Let us finish with this.
General Thogan?
My knights will seal off the exits from the feast.
- No one will get out.
- Good.
General Rumboldt?
When the signal is given, my archers will kill everyone at the feast.
General Renquo, you shall see to it that all the king's bodyguards are dead before the assassinations begin.
What is the signal?
When Alana gives her vows.
Imagine, all the nobility of Ehdan and the kings of four empires wiped out in one fell swoop.
Cromwell is a genius.
In three hours' time, one man will control the entire… civilized world.
Their royal majesties, king Leonidas of Minoa, king Ludwig of Galese, king Sancho of Valencia and king Charles of the Franks.
Is that chief Talon?
It certainly looks like him.
Well?
It is him.
How can that be?
Last I heard, he was chieftain of the black tribes, helping them to overthrow some slaver.
We owe that man too much to let him die like some dog at the hands of Cromwell.
Yes, but the treaty.
Damn the treaty!
There'd be no kingdoms at all if it weren't for him.
It will mean war.
Very well.
Let it be war.
Cromwell! Cromwell!
Cromwell! Cromwell!
Join hands.
Who is here to help the barbarian with the gauntlet of steel?
- Who are you?
- Never mind.
The barbarian is to be killed at any moment. We must save him.
Unlock this door, wench, and leave that to us!
Let's treat the gods to one hell of a fight.
- For Talon!
- Talon!
Talon!
Don't worry, little girl.
It won't hurt until I hit the bone.
Do you, Titus Cromwell, take this woman to be your bride, your queen, the mother of your children?
I do.
Repeat after me.
Do you, Alana, daughter of lord Mogolin and last heir to the crown of Ehdan, take this man, Titus, protector of Ehdan,
Emperor of Swabia,
Castul, Goth,
Aragon and Iberia, overlord of Brishia and Kelti and all the northern kingdoms of the west of Evmark, master of suders, lord and god over all that is right and good, to be your groom, your lover, master and the father of your children?
I…
Cromwell!
Attack!
Stand back.
Small world, your majesty.
Talon!
I put your army on alert and had them gather seven days' ride from here.
They await your presence.
That's quite perceptive of you to assume something might go wrong.
I have lived only to serve you, your majesty.
With your army ready to strike, we shall yet crush these rebel dogs.
This won't take but a moment.
Men, thou art the devil.
Ah. Machelli, the rebellion is finally on.
Yes.
Now I must get you to safety.
Machelli.
Finish the dog.
You go after Alana.
Go!
- What are you doing?
- We await Cromwell.
Why?
To end his reign and begin mine.
But Mikah…
Mikah is dead.
No. No. No.
The rebellion is dead.
I am the power!
Beyond that gate lies my destiny.
You can be part of it or a victim of it.
The choice is yours.
All right.
I've wanted you for a long time.
You are the strength.
You are the power.
Take me with you.
You are wiser than I thought, Alana.
Promise me you'll obey my every wish, my every command.
Yes.
I'll obey you.
You obey this.
See me, Alana, as I truly am.
Now you are mine.
Die, jackal!
And now
I shall have thy soul, thy body, thy empire.
I have no quarrel with you.
Out of my way.
- Cromwell is mine!
- Now we have a quarrel.
Sly sword.
Then let's finish it.
Who are you?
Talon, son of Richard.
No!
Why the long faces?
Good god, you've snatched a kingdom.
Talon! Talon!
- Talon!
- Talon!
- Talon!
- Talon!
Talon! Talon!
And all that goes with it.
Don't we have some business to attend to?
That we do.
So the debt's been paid, eh, general?
Aye.
Now to Maladon to save Lonbosha's kingdom.
What do you want?
To join up.
I want to ride with you.
Well, then let's be off.
We've a battle in the offing, kingdoms to save and women to love.
August 9, 2:30 p.m.
Greenwich Mean Time.
The H.M.S. Churchill, outward bound.
On board: a joint
British-American space team.
Their mission: to intercept and study the comet bearing Dr. Hailey's name.
The Churchill is the first spacecraft equipped with the Nerva engine.
It propels the Churchill with constant acceleration... enough to create Earth-type gravity for the first time on an extended flight.
The Churchill is on course for its rendezvous.
- Sir, this is odd.
- What?
I'm getting a small radar cross section... just ahead of the nucleus in the coma of the comet.
I've got it too. Check the length.
It's at the limit of my scan angle.
- What's going on?
- You run an equipment check?
Every five minutes.
- Radar states 150 miles.
- 150 miles what?
- Length.
- 150 miles long?
What's 150 miles long?
It's a radar trace.
- Something in the coma of the comet.
- Show me.
- E.G.R. is confirmed.
- Looks good.
E.G.R. is optimal.
Track three on three.
Roger.
What's its height?
I've got a vertical reading of two miles at least.
Ambient temperature: six degrees.
Less than two percent traces of manganese, titanium--
Try and raise base.
Tell them we have an artificial object out here hidden--
- Are you sure you want to say "hidden"?
- It's located in the head of the comet.
Keep sending that until they acknowledge.
Use a secured downlink.
Sorry, Commander, everything's been swamped by the coma winds.
We can't get anything back to base.
How long is the blackout period? all the way.
What are you gonna do?
Go on in.
We're only gonna get one chance,
Derebridge.
That thing won't be back for another 76 years... and we'll both be dead.
We have to take a look now.
- Shut down Nerva.
- Shutting down.
Down.
- Solar panels retracted.
- Check. Give me a readout, Bob.
Executing E.V.A. maneuver.
Where do you suppose this thing came from?
- Was it exploring the comet?
- Come on, guys, let's do it.
The surface looks badly pitted.
In that case, it's been here a long time.
It's derelict, whatever it is.
Stand by, Churchill.
We're going in.
Roger, Carlsen.
We copy. We have you going in.
Churchill, it looks like some giant artery, organic.
I almost have the feeling
I've been here before.
Oh, boy.
This is incredible.
I hope you can appreciate the scale of this on the video.
Roger. We're getting it.
It's all on tape.
Oh, shit.
Whoa. Here they are.
Churchill... it looks like we found the occupants of the ship.
They look like giant bats.
- There must be hundreds of them.
- Thousands.
Dead, I hope.
Looks prehistoric.
It's completely desiccated.
- Crumbles.
- Yes, it would. all the fluid's been lost to space over the years. we'll bag this one, take it with us.
We're deploying the specimen bag.
Jesus.
What the hell is that?
Commander... the ship has just deployed a--
It looks like some sort of big structure that's just unfolding.
It's enormous.
God, what is it?
We must get out of here.
Nobody's going anywhere.
Stay where you are.
Churchill, this is Carlsen.
What's happening out there?
The thing stopped opening.
The only way to describe it is it's like a giant umbrella.
Good God.
It's absolutely enormous.
What's it doing now?
Nothing, sir.
It's stopped opening.
It's just sitting there.
- Can you tell what it's made of?
- Not metal.
It's radar transparent.
Okay.
If it starts up again, let me know.
Any activity out there.
You understand?
Yes, sir.
That's where we're going.
There's something there.
Commander, this is Churchill.
We're losing our signal.
We've lost V.T.R.
Come in, Commander!
Three bodies.
Perfectly preserved.
They look to me to be like an--
Something's happening to me.
What's wrong with me?
Commander, come in.
This is Churchill.
Do you copy?
They seem to be in some sort of suspended animation or sleep.
Hold on.
We're coming down.
Churchill, if you read... there are two nude males and one female.
This is Churchill.
We have no picture. Come in, Tom.
Churchill,
I said we found a young girl.
"girl"? You mean human?
Definitely humanoid.
I'd say she's perfect.
I've been in space for six months.
She looks perfect to me.
- Derebridge, what's wrong?
- What's wrong?
- How many do you want to take back?
- I say we take back all three... and one of the dead things in the other chamber.
Let's see if we can break them free.
Churchill, come in.
This is Mission Control, Great Britain.
Do you copy?
If they're going to pick us up, they should get us this close.
Simply aren't receiving,
Dr. Bukovsky.
Automatic circuits don't even respond.
They're radio dead.
Christ, I hope it's just their communications.
How's their orbit look?
You can see it's stable, but they're slightly off.
They should have adjusted coming in... but they haven't.
What do you make of that?
It would appear that they set their course... just after they left the comet and haven't updated it since.
- The Columbia?
- The Columbia.
We have a liftoff.
Tower cleared.
Control, this is Columbia.
Are we cleared to initiate docking procedure?
Go ahead, Columbia.
You are looking good.
Stand by for soft dock.
Soft dock.
Soft dock confirmed.
Columbia, the ship's completely gutted.
Oh, my God.
Houston, we have a problem.
There's been a fire.
I'll take a look in the tug bay.
You two, try the top deck.
Columbia, they're all dead.
Nothing down here, Columbia.
I'm going into the tug bay.
I'll get the tapes.
Somner... there's something you ought to see in the tug bay.
I see.
How did you open the girl's case?
We didn't, Minister.
We were talking about how to get it open when it popped open of its own accord.
- Did you X-ray the crystal cases?
- We're not certain they're crystal.
The casings are not metallic.
I'm not even sure they're organic.
The casing is right there in front of us without being there...
- if that makes any sense.
- And the bodies?
We're going to do our first dissection now.
Provided, of course, that Dr. Fallada agrees they're dead.
I don't know that I am quallfied to pass judgment on alien death.
You would agree that they're less allve than we are?
Yesterday in Hong Kong, gold closed lower.
In light trading on European currency markets... the pound closed mixed against the dollar and West German marks.
There will be a full market report after the late news.
This is James Graham reporting from the city.
Now back to the newsroom.
Hailey's Comet is now dominating the northern sky... stretching over 100 million miles across the heavens... occupying one-sixth of the entire visible horizon.
On this exceptionally clear night... a group of enthusiasts are commemorating
Dr. Edmund Hailey's great prediction... by holding an outdoor watching from his original observatory at Greenwich.
Our viewers may be interested to know... that comets were once considered to be hargingers of evil.
One of the earliest words for comet was "disaster"... which in Latin means "evil star."
It may indeed be an evil star for the deep space probe Churchill.
There's still no word from Her Majesty's government as to the fate of the crew... whether they're allve or dead.
We can only await further developments--
Use my body.
- Where's the girl?
- She's gone.
I saw her.
She did that.
- Security.
- Hello. Professor Fallada here.
I'm calling at Dr. Bukovsky's orders.
- Get me the duty security captain now.
- Yes, sir.
Don't worry.
A naked girl is not going to get out of this complex.
Four-nine to Control. you'll never believe what I'm looking at.
- Control, can you say that again?
- I believe you heard me.
There's a girl on the loose in the building. She must not leave.
Pardon me, but I thought you said she was naked.
That's right. That's what I said.
Surely, you can find her.
Must be some kind of joke.
Don't believe it. all right, miss, just stay where you are.
You heard them.
They said grab her.
Take it easy, mate.
She's not in her right mind.
Control, we have located the girl in the main lobby.
That's it. Come on.
- Yes?
- We've located the girl, sir.
- Where?
- She's downstairs in the main lobby.
Right.
She's in the main lobby.
You all right to go down there?
Nice and easy.
Come on.
Come to me.
Come to Daddy.
Make it stop.
Come on!
Let's get her!
- Are you all right, mate?
- Yeah. all nonmilitary personnel please clear the area.
I repeat: Everybody who has no business to be here... please clear the area for your own safety.
This is a police announcement.
Sorry, gentlemen, no photographs, please.
It's all right.
- Which of you is Dr. Bukovsky?
- I am.
- I'm Colonel Caine.
- From the S.A.S.?
That last remark is not for publication.
This is a D notice situation.
Not too close.
And this was murder, you say?
Tell me again how the girl overpowered you.
She--
It was the most overwhelmingly feminine presence I've ever encountered.
- I was drawn to her on a level that--
- Was it sexual?
Yes, overwhelmingly so.
And horrible.
Loss of control.
The guard was dead when you came into the room?
- You found him as he is now?
- Yeah.
And the girl came from the ship
Churchill?
Uh-huh.
She spoke to you, in English?
That's right.
How would she know English?
Going back, you say the ship's tapes were destroyed in the fire.
They weren't destroyed in the fire.
That's what we were told to tell the public. They were erased.
"Erased"?
Also, the Churchill's escape pod is missing.
- Did someone escape?
- We don't know.
Unfortunately, the condition of the bodies... make an accurate count impossible.
Could the heat from the fire have launched the pod?
What started the fire?
The ship's oxygen system ignited.
It was a terribly hot fire.
Yet you say the three cases containing the bodies were untouched.
- That's correct.
- Where were they found?
In the bay where the space tug was stored.
Where everything else was charred.
Incredible, is it not?
- Have you examined the cases?
- Using every technique we have.
X-ray scans of the cases yield only blurred images.
-What does that mean?
-They're not precisely physical objects.
More like a force field.
We're a bit out of our depth here.
The whole thing is--
Yes, I know, incredible.
Have they done an autopsy yet on the guard? I suppose not.
What about your two other bodies?
Colonel, may I be excused?
I seem to be feeling a little more nauseous than I thought.
Yes, of course.
I noticed from your door, Dr. Fallada, that your area is biochemistry.
But I understand your real interest is--
Death, Colonel Caine.
Correct.
Thanatology is the name for it.
Death for you is a bureaucratic problem.
Who did it? When?
Why did they do it?
- Am I correct?
- And for you?
I'm fascinated by death itself: what happens as we die, when we die, what happens after we die.
- You mean life after death?
- Yes.
- ls there life after death?
- Do you really want to know?
But to answer your question, yes, I think there is.
If I am correct, the lifeforce is conserved always... and in all things, even after death.
You think that applies to what's happened here tonight?
Yes, I do.
I think that girl, creature... drained energy, lifeforce... partially from Bukovsky and totally from the guard.
- A vampire?
- lt could be described that way.
In a sense, we're all vampires.
We drain energy from other life-forms.
The difference is one of degree.
That girl was no girl.
She is totally alien to this planet and our life-form... and totally dangerous.
Jesus.
- Do you believe those blokes are allve?
- I'm not paid to believe nothing.
I believe they're allve.
Don't look bloody dead to me.
We've had some trouble, but everything's under control.
I think you better come down here.
Yes, sir.
Very good, sir.
It would appear these two are no longer dangerous.
There is certainly no possiblity of doing a full autopsy on them.
I would like to examine the guard.
Have they started the autopsy on the guard yet?
I believe so, sir.
This is an autopsy on the body of a young man, dead approximately two hours.
- Did you say he was about twenty?
- Yes, that's correct.
Get the Colonel down here!
Put him in an isolation cell, quickly!
I had no idea it could be passed on.
What do you suggest?
I would recommend that you place this body in another cell.
It was two hours ago that the guard was attacked.
I won't be at all surprised if we're seeing a pattern here.
- Do as he says, Kelly.
- Yes, sir.
Also, I want the two other male bodies that were shot.
Collect the pieces and watch them.
- Get me the Home Secretary now.
- Sir.
- Call for the Colonel, sir.
- Sir, you have a call.
I'll be right there.
They've just found a body in Hyde Park.
A naked girl.
They say she's in an indescribable condition.
Could that be your girl?
- Well?
- That's not her.
Inspector, what about the two boys?
They were in the park earlier, sir.
We saw her, I think, earlier.
Any rate, that looks like her hair.
- What a mess.
- Was she alone?
No, that's why we noticed her.
She was with a dark-haired girl, real good-looking and all.
Didn't have a lot of clothes on either.
We thought they might be--
Well, you know.
Yes. Did you see where the dark-haired girl went?
No, we didn't.
We angled on back to see if maybe we could... you know, see them doing something.
- That's when we found her.
- How long ago was that?
- Half an hour ago.
- This lad phoned us, and we called you.
Yes. Thank you, lnspector.
Obviously, the work of the girl.
Could we have this body sent back to the center with the others?
Yes, I suppose that's a good idea.
Inspector, let me know if you find anything else.
- we'll be taking her back with us.
- Very good, sir.
Now she has clothes.
There's something
I want you to see, sir.
Dr. Hans Fallada, Sir Percy
Hestlestine, the Home Secretary.
You're just in time.
It's exactly two hours.
This is the guard who was originally overcome by the space girl.
As I feared, once transformed... the victims need regular infusions of energy...
- otherwise--
- Otherwise what?
Oh, my God. Dear God.
And we have the pathologist who was attacked by the guard.
- See?
- He, too, needs feeding.
The same thing will happen to that girl we found in the park... in about one hour.
Good Lord! Goodness!
She's the last?
- Have there been any further reports?
- No, sir.
We're set up to get the calls here the instant one comes in.
- What?
- Nothing.
You say these creatures were brought back from the Churchill?
Yes, sir, but not this one.
She's a victim of the creatures.
Yes, but where did the Churchill acquire them?
We have no way of determining that at present.
- Perhaps that's all changing.
- What?
I've just received a call from the J.P.L. in Pasadena.
The goldstone tracking disc has just picked up something... they think is Churchill's escape pod reentering the Earth's atmosphere.
- Where?
- Texas.
Where?
Walter Reed Army Hospital?
Is he hurt? Just exhausted.
Get him the hell over here!
Colonel Carlsen?
They're expecting you, sir.
Colonel Carlsen, sir.
Tom.
I thought you were dead. allow me to introduce Colonel Caine of the Special Air Services.
How do you do?
- You already know Dr. Fallada.
- Colonel.
Take a seat.
I'm sorry to drag you over here like this.
I'm sure you'd rather be recuperating with a pretty nurse.
We've got to know what happened on the Churchill.
Yes, of course.
It may be very difficult for you... to accept what
I'm going to say. we'll have very little difficulty believing anything you have to tell us.
- Do go on.
- You know something?
There was a fire aboard the Churchill.
You might be interested to know that the bodies of the three humanoids... were not destroyed in that fire.
They survived in their cases.
They were brought down here to London, and the female has escaped.
She's killed three people already.
Oh, my God.
So whatever you have to tell us is rather pressing.
Please, tell us what happened.
We found the bodies aboard the alien spacecraft.
What alien spacecraft?
Colonel, take it from the beginning.
Assume we know nothing, which is understating the matter.
We approached within 9,000 miles of Hailey's Comet... when we detected an object in the comet's coma.
After we discovered the bodies, we transferred them to the Churchill.
We have the three humanoid creatures and one of the bat-like things.
This is Churchill.
We copy. Welcome back.
Have you gotten through to Earth yet, Rawlings?
No, sir, and the tall of the comet's heating up.
- What's the matter, Derebridge?
- I don't know, Tom.
I feel drained.
Do you?
I feel invigorated.
You okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.
- Okay.
Everybody back to their stations.
Let's get the hell out of here.
On the trip back to Earth, the crew began to die... one by one.
Rawlings... the radio officer, was the first to go.
Rawlings denied any knowledge of what he had done.
I don't remember.
Besides myself, you're the only one who has been up here in the last hour.
I've been feeling weak recently... not myself.
Just don't remember.
We found Rawlings' body the next day. exactly how... did he die, Colonel?
The life just drained out of him.
One by one... the rest of the crew began to die.
Somehow...
I don't know how...
I held out.
It just seemed to be a matter of will.
I always thought--
The girl--
Yes? The girl?
I can't remember.
What I remember next... is the view out of the observation window... coming into Earth's orbit.
I couldn't expose the world to what we'd brought back with us.
I was determined to destroy them all.
It was the hardest thing I ever did.
We understand.
It must have taken great courage to try and make--
No, you don't understand.
Part of me didn't want to leave.
She killed all my friends, and I still didn't want to leave.
Leaving her was the hardest thing
I ever did.
Colonel Carlsen looks exhausted to me.
We should allow him to get some sleep, continue with this later.
Very well.
Thank you, Colonel.
NASA tracking and ours... have just reported an unusual structure leaving Hailey's Comet.
It's headed for us.
What is it?
Radar ranging reports the object... is a needlelike shape,
150 miles long.
Its present course projects out into a perfect Earth orbit... in a little more than two days.
I've just received a call from the Prime Minister.
There's going to be a meeting at Downing Street.
Prime Minister wants answers.
Close your eyes.
You're giving me your life.
You're taking it.
You're draining me.
You're taking too much of me.
It was just a dream.
- What dream?
- The girl-- She visited me.
Visited you? How?
In my mind.
She has some kind of mental contact with me.
She's draining me.
Tell us about the dream.
I can't. It's gone.
It's faded.
I can't remember.
Have you ever been hypnotized?
Do you mind if I try?
Yeah, let's try it.
- Not now. He's too exhausted.
- Fine. ln the morning.
Just stare at it until your eyes feel tired, then close them.
You'll feel very tired, very sleepy.
She seems to speak to me in my dreams.
She--
The girl--
I feeI--
What do you feel for her?
I feel very... close to her.
Is she in touch with you?
I feel... as if my mind... is not entirely my own.
If she is in contact with your mind... perhaps you are in contact with hers.
Can you see her?
Can you see where she is?
Yes.
Where is she now?
A place.
I don't know the name of it.
She's walking.
She has a different face... but it's her.
"A different face"?
How can that be?
She's using a different body.
- What is she doing?
- She's looking for a man.
What man?
Any man.
A healthy man.
Does she intend to kill him?
- Why not?
- She's afraid of being caught.
- How could she be caught?
- The body would give her away.
What is she hoping to do?
She wants to... draw some energy from him.
Not enough to kill him.
- She can do that?
- Yes.
There's another mind.
Yes.
The girl's name... is Ellen.
There are two people in one body?
Two minds?
Ellen and the vampire?
Yes.
She's watching a man.
What is the man doing?
He's parked, doing something with his car.
Get the license number.
Can you see the license number of his car?
Yes.
Read it out.
FMC...
129E... or R.
What is the make of the car?
A white Volvo.
What is she doing now?
They're driving now.
Does she ask him his name?
She's pulling her skirt... over her knees.
She's--
He's... putting his... hand on her leg.
FMC129E or possibly R... belonging to a white Volvo.
The driver of the car picked up a girl named Ellen.
I have to know who the girl is and where we can find her.
She's connected with the case.
I can't explain over an open line.
Thank you.
Do you think he's telling the truth about the girl? we'll soon see.
How brilliant, if she is moving from body to body, mind to mind... taking only a small amount of energy from each victim.
It would make sense that we're finding no new victims.
She's hoping to leave no trail.
If the girl is no longer in her original body, where is her body?
- Hidden.
- Let's find it.
Supposing you're right about all of this.
What about that ship up there?
What's it doing?
We can't know that, but we've got to assume the worst.
Maybe they're like the vampires of legend.
How's that?
They would carry their Earth with them, in their coffins.
Wouldn't they?
- We have the feed from Hawall.
- Here it comes.
- Put it on screen number one.
- Coming in 240,000 miles.
My God, it's immense.
Hugh, do you have that skin tissue sample I asked for?
Good.
Of course, I'll follow containment procedure.
He's here now.
Send in that soldier, please.
Thank you.
One moment, Sergeant.
Thank you for coming.
I'll be with you shortly. bloody awful job, chasing that car.
It belongs to a man named
Ned Price who lives in Yorkshire.
- We have him under detention now.
- What about the girl?
The girl he picked up was a nurse named Ellen, as you said.
Ellen something.
He doesn't know her other name.
He dropped her at Thurlstone Hospital after spending the afternoon with her.
He was reluctant to talk about it.
The man's totally exhausted.
Isn't Thurlstone an asylum of some sort?
Yes, for the criminally insane.
How do you do? I'm Dr. Armstrong, director of the hospital.
Come with me to my office.
- It's a cold night.
- Bitterly cold.
This is the nurses' house.
Ellen Donaldson is number five.
Thank you.
Shouldn't I come up and introduce you?
- I'd rather you didn't.
- Come along, Dr. Armstrong.
You and I have several matters to discuss.
Yes? Who is it?
My name's Colin Caine.
Dr. Armstrong brought me over.
I'd like to talk to you.
May I come in?
Yes?
- What do you want?
- My name is Colin Caine.
This is Colonel Carlsen,
United States Air Force.
May we come in and talk to you?
We have seen Dr. Armstrong.
May I sit down?
I want to ask about the man you spent the afternoon with, Ned Price.
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-I think you do.
- Let me see your hand.
- Beg your pardon?
You're in there, aren't you?
- I don't know.
- Tell me.
It's gone from her.
It's in another body now.
- How do you know that?
- I can see it, in her mind.
She's resisting.
I'll have to force her to tell me.
Despite appearances, this woman is a masochist.
An extreme masochist.
She wants me to force the name out of her.
She wants me to hurt her.
I can see the images in her mind.
Do you want to stay?
- Otherwise, wait outside!
- Not at all. I am a natural voyeur.
Are you in there?
Are you there?
Let go.
Now.
Well?
I've got a physical description.
You better send someone to look after Nurse Donaldson.
Is she all right?
If I described one of the inmates to you, could you identify him?
Possibly.
Big man, fat, gray hair, birthmark on his face.
Jeffrey Sykes, the child murderer.
Where did you get his description?
- Where is he now?
- He's in solitary confinement.
He's been naughty.
- What is this about?
- What we're looking for has moved.
- We could be here some time.
- I better call London.
- May I use your telephone, Doctor?
- Certainly.
- We have to see Sykes now.
- Couldn't this wait until the morning? all right, I'll arrange it.
Anything to oblige, Commander.
I wish this were not so mysterious.
If the police are involved, haven't I a right to know?
If you're going to start messing about with my patients--
Dr. Armstrong, I sympathize with your position, of course.
However, I can tell you it is a matter of national security.
I see.
But don't you think that I should be present... to represent the interests of my patient?
- You see--
- Can I talk to you for a second?
Of course.
The man has the I.Q. of a child of four.
That's a decision I shall have to defer to Colonel Caine.
Yes, of course, you can come along.
Can we start now?
- What are you going to do to him?
- I'd like to hypnotize him.
What's that?
Pentothal and morphine.
Recommended for pre-hypnosis and patient management.
Well, he seems quiet.
- We're ready when you are.
- Lamson.
Sir.
Can the injection be dangerous?
He should have no difficulty tolerating it.
There's always a risk, sir.
May I have that?
I'll wake him up.
- What are you doing?
- Stay where you are.
He's sick, Lamson.
Help us. I can't explain now.
There's our killer, Sir Percy.
It's madness.
I want to question him.
Where can we take him?
Up the ramp, sir.
We need to be alone.
How did you know it was him?
In the nurses' quarters, he touched me on the shoulder.
I saw into his mind.
What?
The Colonel is able to see into the minds of people... who have been possessed by the girl creature, sir.
It happens when I touch them.
Let's get him on the table.
How--
How do you know she's still inside Armstrong?
What's to prevent her from moving to someone else?
She's trapped.
I can feel that.
Are you sure?
- Lamson.
- Sir?
- Bring me another dose of the drug.
- One dose is usually enough.
This is not a usual situation.
How long does this stuff last?
A dose like that?
A couple of hours. we'll definitely need more.
- Bring me three doses.
- Three?
I'll take responsibility.
Just get on with it.
Yes, sir.
Is a second dose safe?
Surely it can strain his heart.
Look, you don't know what we're deallng with here.
If he slips out from under, she'll escape.
Can you hear me?
If you can hear me, just say yes.
It won't let me... talk to you.
Can you see what's holding you prisoner?
Yes. She--
Tell her she has to talk to me!
Yes?
I brought the Pentothal.
Thanks. That will be all.
Hold him.
There's no need for that.
You in there?
Can you still hear me?
Can you get into his mind, her mind?
Not with this drug.
It's like a wall.
Perhaps you've given him too much.
Shut up!
Listen, you bitch...
I'll keep you in this state for weeks if I have to.
Now, you talk to me.
Carlsen, be with me.
- What do you want from me?
- I love you.
What are you?
Why are you so human, so perfect?
What are the bird creatures on the ship?
Our bodies are unimportant.
As you and your men approached in your ship... we changed them for you.
We entered your minds... and found there new bodies.
I took my shape from your mind.
I took your language.
I became the woman I found there... in your deepest thoughts, your deepest needs.
I am the feminine in your mind.
Where are you?
Where's your body?
Let me go!
Touch me, Carlsen.
- It's already spreading.
- How?
- You didn't stop it. It's too late.
- That's impossible.
We've only been half a step behind her all the way.
This gentleman stopped breathing.
There's no pulse either.
I think his neck is broken.
Prepare a stretcher for Sir Percy and one for Dr. Armstrong.
Prepare all your remaining doses of the drug for travel.
Yes, sir.
You said the thing hadn't stopped, it was still spreading.
- Why did you say that?
- I don't know.
Could the girl have been deliberately leading us away from London?
Did we find all of her victims?
If there are others besides the girl in the park--
- The thing would spread.
- ln a chain reaction... geometrically, until, by now--
Christ.
Lieutenant, can we use the radio to reach the S.R.C. in London?
Just a moment, sir.
There's something coming through.
It is the S.R.C. for you and Carlsen.
Go ahead.
Can you hear me?
Fallada, speak up!
I can't hear you!
The two males didn't die.
They jumped to the bodies of the two soldiers who shot them... and transformed the soldiers' bodies into their own likenesses.
That's the difference between them and their victims.
Their victims can't leave their bodies.
Only the original three can do that.
- But I've killed one of them.
- One of which?
One of the two male vampires.
- One of the transformed ones.
- How did you kill him?
The old way, Carlsen.
A leaded metal shaft penetrating not through the heart... but through the energy center two inches below the heart.
Not steel, but leaded iron.
Right, Carlsen?
- Are you there?
- Yes.
Carlsen, and you, too, Caine... it is my belief... that the vampires of legend came from creatures such as these.
Perhaps even from these very creatures.
I know it sounds incredible.
Do you hear me?
It's more than a belief.
It's true.
They visited Earth before.
- What about the other male?
- He's free.
- You have the girl?
- Yes.
- we'll be there soon. Hold on.
- we'll try.
- This came while you were talking.
- What is it?
A scrambled cryptograph to Sir Percy from the Prime Minister.
We're to proceed directly to the citadel at Whitehall.
Lieutenant, the controls!
We've lost her.
She's gone!
- Where?
- Her body's in London.
Where in London?
You've got to tell me what really happened on the Churchill.
It wasn't Rawlings who destroyed the radio equipment... and the ship's tapes.
- lt was me.
- Why?
I didn't want the Churchill to be able to reach Earth.
And if it did, I didn't want anyone to know what happened.
What did happen?
I opened her sealed animation case.
Either I did it or she did it.
I couldn't help myself.
I've never experienced such--
I was in love on a level you've never known.
It terrifies me.
My memory plays tricks on me.
She was calling me.
Her power was spiritual.
She wanted me, Caine.
It was more than spiritual.
She took some of my energy.
And she gave me some of her energy.
They must have been living off of each other when we found them.
There were only three of them left.
She killed all of my men, one by one.
But I survived.
She wanted me to survive.
She chose me!
Why?
She's not human.
She's not a woman.
She'll destroy you.
She's destroyed worlds.
There's something you might want to hear, sir.
A special bulletin from the BBC.
Tonight London is on the brink... of the worst devastation since the blitz.
I can see large areas of the city burning out of control.
Thousands of people are now rampaging through the streets... in a frenzied last effort to avoid the plague.
Martial law has been enforced now for three hours... but it hasn't stemmed what is obviously--
- Yes, we've been expecting you.
- Thank you. Carry on.
- Hurry over, Sergeant.
- Right, sir.
- Go around the other side.
- Right.
Is everything ready for the cabinet to evacuate?
- Yes, everything.
- Please take a seat, gentlemen.
Sir, I have Colonel Caine and Colonel Carlsen here for you.
Very good.
The Prime Minister will see you shortly.
Would you care for tea while you wait?
- Our business is rather urgent.
- The Prime Minister understands that.
- Gentlemen.
- Prime Minister.
I'm Colonel Caine,
Special Air Service... and I'm sure you've heard of Colonel Carlsen of the Churchill.
Yes, indeed.
Gentlemen, I look forward to hearing your report.
By the way, where is Sir Percy?
Dead, I'm afraid.
Oh, that's a great pity.
Sir, we have information regarding the object in space...
- which is bearing down on the Earth--
- Yes, gentlemen.
If you'll excuse me just for a moment.
Miss Haversham, please come this way.
Here, for a moment.
I'll be back, gentlemen.
Please.
Somebody get the doctor immediately.
We need a doctor over here.
Go!
- Do you have any weapons aboard?
- No, sir!
- There is a flare pistol, sir.
- Where is it?
Close the breach and it's ready to fire!
Get him!
While you were with the Prime Minister,
I had a call from base operations.
The city is now under martial law.
We've been placed under NATO command.
- NATO?
- Yes, sir.
My unit's been mobilized to a staging area at Blackheath.
Land at the S.R.C.
We've got to talk to Fallada.
I'm to land at Blackheath.
The city's under air quarantine.
If we don't do as they say, they'll shoot us down.
Zero, this is X-ray 318 requesting clearance to land. Over.
Zero, roger.
X-ray 318, you are clear to land.
Come away from the aircraft!
You are under quarantine!
Over here, please, sir.
Don't come any closer!
Stop there!
I want to talk to your commanding officer.
I am Colonel Caine,
Special Air Service... and this man is Colonel Tom Carlsen,
United States Air Force... and former commander of the Churchill.
Is Dr. Hans Fallada here from the S.R.C.?
- He knows who we are.
- No, not that I know of.
Has anybody heard of him?
He must still be in London.
Colonel, what exactly do you know about what's happening there? all we know for certain is that a terrible plague is sweeping London.
The incubation period appears to be two hours.
Until that time has elapsed,
I cannot release you from this compound.
We know what the plague is.
We are not infected.
I know what I'm talking about!
We're wasting valuable time!
We have totally isolated London... in order to stop further contagion.
If that falls, and the surrounding areas are threatened...
Yes? sterilization by thermonuclear device has been approved.
We have this from General Ames in Brussels.
He's coming up with that decision in just under three hours.
Have you heard anything about the ship?
- "The ship"?
- The thing from Hailey's Comet.
It's parked itself in a geostationary orbit directly over London. all those little blue lights going up toward the clouds are human souls.
- How do you know that?
- I feel it.
The process of conversion releases a life energy that can be collected.
"Collected"?
Is that what the umbrella is?
A collector?
The energy doesn't go free.
It goes up there.
The male vampire is collecting life energy... but he has to send it through her to get it up to the collector.
Where is she?
Over there.
I get flashes coming from her body.
It's sensitive to its environment.
It picks up things.
- Can you find her?
- lf I can get across to the city.
What about the male?
He'll come if he senses I found her.
She's drawing me.
I've got to go.
Why?
She wants back the energy she gave me.
When they take on a new life-form... they have to learn from that life-form.
Mate with it, in a sense.
The girl chose me.
But when she mixed with me, she gave me a part of herself.
Now she wants that part back.
Is there any sign of activity in your sector? Over.
- No, sir.
- Okay, keep me posted. Over.
Colonel, listen to me. Carlsen believes he can locate the source.
There are only two carriers.
If we can destroy them, it may not be necessary to destroy London.
But we only have an hour and a half.
Cease firing!
Where's Carlsen?
He knocked over two of my men and took an armored land rover.
Did he say where he was going?
He wanted to know where the Space Research Center was.
Rogers told him, then I was on the ground.
- Right. Whose car is this?
- That?
- That's the Colonel's.
- Give me the keys.
- What?
- I'm commandeering the car!
Give it to him.
And your side arm.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Once you're inside there, we can't allow you out.
- Watch out!
- He's going in!
Colonel Caine, S.A.S.
I'm crossing the river.
- You don't want to go in there.
- I know I don't.
Get them gates in position!
Secure this post! Move!
I'm glad to see you allve.
I reciprocate the sentiment.
- ls he really dead this time?
- The only way they can be killed.
- Where's Bukovsky?
- Dead.
- How?
- Like the rest.
How did you survive?
- You're looking for Carlsen.
- Has he been here?
No. Perhaps he misled you.
- What do you know about it?
- I've been doing some more work.
- Go on.
- I've discovered... there is life after death.
-How do you know?
-There is a certain mental transference.
Telepathy occurs between the vampires and their victims.
- Carlsen is after the girl.
- How did you know that?
- I seem to sense it.
- Where is she?
Don't you know?
- Carlsen knows.
- Where?
She's in the cathedral.
She's been there since she escaped.
Rather a nice touch, don't you think?
The crypt of kings and queens.
Stay where you are.
Here I go.
I knew you would come.
I'm here.
Now can this madness end?
Come.
Be with me.
I need you.
It was always intended... you should find us... and bring us to Earth.
The web of destiny carries your blood and soul... back to the genesis of my life-form.
Come with me.
It will be much less terrifying if you just come to me.
I'll do just that.
What are these feelings?
Why do I feel so close to you, need you?
Because you're one of us.
You always have been.
You're like me.
Be with me.
Just a little more.

The Boy Who Could Fly
DVDRip & Subtitles By Mitt
Well, here we are.
What do you think? lt's nice.
What do you think, Louis? l think he likes it, Mom.
Ride your bikes, too. lt's really dark.
Let's get some light in here.
Listen, guys, there's only one bathroom.
So we're all gonna have to share. lt's the only drawback. This is yours, Mil.
What do you think?
Of course, we'll have to change the wallpaper.
The people who lived here before us had two boys.
So both the kids' bedrooms have boys' wallpaper.
This looks great, Mom. l think you're going to like it. lt's really very subtle.
Condo.
Shipwreck.
Barbecue.
Hi.
Hey, what's going on?
What's he doing? l'd say an F-15.
Let's go, Max. Move out!
This goes over here.
Excuse me.
These your groceries?
Yeah. l'm Geneva Goodman. l live down the street. l guess you'll go to Taft. l go to St. Monica's Catholic School.
Shitty cafeteria. l suppose this is your Coke, too.
We're going to be great friends.
Excuse me.
Drop in again some time, will you?
We're going to miss you, you stupid goof!
You're finished, pal.
Heel, Hitler!
Well, look at this.
Where do you think you're going,
Soldier Boy?
Just around the block.
Just around the block?
Nobody goes around the block here unless you get our okay.
And you don't got it.
See, l'm new, and l just moved down the street.
-So l didn't know.
-Shut up, Soldier Boy.
What do you say, guys? 10 seconds?
We'll give you a 10-second head start, then your ass is grass.
One...
Wait a second.
...two... three... four, five, six... seven, eight, nine, ten.
Go on! Get him!
Get back here, you coward!
There he is! Let's get him!
Get him! lt's a fantastic mall.
Movie theater, all the best clothes.
-How much allowance do you get?
-Mom... l'd like you to meet Geneva.
Geneva, this is my mom.
This is my brother, Sonny.
Hello.
Say hello to your new neighbors, idiot.
Nice to meet you.
-Well, see you later.
-'Bye.
See you later.
So you guys thought you weren't going to make any friends.
Mom?
Hi, honey. l was in bed. l was almost asleep, and l just.... l got the strongest feeling that something was missing.
That we forgot something at home.
So l came downstairs and started going through everything. l checked all the furniture. l went over the inventory from the moving company. lt's all here.
And l realized... what it was. lt's not going to be easy, honey. l'm really going to need your help. l know, Mom.
Yeah, l know you do.
You better get to sleep.
You've got a big day tomorrow.
Good night, Mom.
You didn't forget anything back home, did you, girl?
We're late! Move it!
Louis, get dressed real fast. We're late.
Come on! Pretend you're a fireman.
You guys aren't moving very fast.
Where's your shirt? l can't find my shirt.
-Would you help me....
-l got it, Mom. We're gonna be so late. lf there's slobber on this shirt, you're gonna get it.
You've got to take him to room number 3. lt's right next to the school office.
Here's lunch money, honey.
-No soda.
-l can find it.
Milly better take you.
-No problem. You guys are already late.
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, no problem.
-Okay.
You be good.
First days count.
The name's Louis Michaelson. lf this is the third grade, l got to be here.
So where do l sit?
Now, as to the theme....
Hello. You must be Amelia.
Yes, ma'am.
Come, Amelia.
Sit in this middle seat, will you, please?
Class... this is Amelia Michaelson.
She's a new student here at Taft... and l hope that you will make her feel very welcome.
Amelia, we're discussing
Romeo and Juliet today.
The theme: young love.
Pure, passionate, ill-fated. lt was not original... even when Shakespeare wrote this play in 1596.
The charm of Romeo and Juliet is its language.
When Juliet learns who Romeo is, she speaks:
''My only love sprung from my only hate!
''Too early seen unknown, and known too late! '' l was approaching the red light and l was coming through this point here. l put on my brakes, and the guy smashed right into me.
Please make sure Collins takes that file to the conference in Chicago.
-Yes, Mr. Brandt.
-Mr. Brandt?
Yeah.
Hi, l'm Charlene Michaelson...
Donald Michaelson's wife.
Yes, of course.
We're all very sorry to hear about Donald.
He was a delightful man.
Thank you.
So l understand you're going to give the insurance business a go.
Well, l'm not new to the business. l was a regional manager when Donald and l first met. l can't imagine things have changed so much in 13 years.
Louis?
-Starting a new graveyard?
-Yeah, Duke got killed.
He was one of your favorites, wasn't he?
He was a good man, but he got careless.
A sniper got him.
You got to be careful in this war.
Why don't you come on inside and set the table, okay?
Okay.
-Hi! l'm home.
-Hi, Mom!
How was school? l got homework already!
What are your teachers like?
Mrs. Sherman, Mom. She's great.
-What about yours, Louis?
-She gave me homework already!
Yeah, well... guess what?
Your mom's got homework, too.
What?
Suddenly it seems the entire insurance business is run by computers.
Oh, no.
They got me working on a trial basis till l can figure it out.
He sent me home with a whole carload full of books to study.
-lt's okay. l'll be all right.
-l'm sure you will. l found out about the boy next door.
His name's Eric Gibb.
They think he's autistic.
He's got some marbles loose, or what?
Well, they don't exactly know.
But he's never spoken a word in his life, and he doesn't like to be around people.
There's some institute that wants to come and take him away... but Mrs. Sherman says he's better off with his uncle.
He's in my class at school.
Mrs. Sherman used to teach those kind of kids.
She thinks that maybe being around normal people will help him, or something.
Where are his parents?
That's the weird part.
When Eric was five years old... his parents went on a trip to Spain or France, or someplace like that.
The plane crashed and they died.
Oh, dear.
Now, what l heard... is at the moment the plane went down...
Eric was alone in his room.
And without anybody even telling him anything... he started to pretend to fly. lt's like, somehow he knew his parents were about to crash.
The way he figured he could save them was by being an airplane.
He's been one ever since.
We have the staff and facilities to give individual care.
He's doing fine at home, and l'm giving him special attention at school.
-He'll be safer with us.
-He doesn't want to be there.
You saw how sick he got last time.
He had a fever. lt had nothing to do with being in the institute.
Look, he still exhibits antisocial behavior. lt wasn't the fever, he's afraid of being confined. l think, gentlemen, if you let him go, you'll find out he'll go in by himself.
Be careful with him on the stairs.
You need any help?
Mil, what's happening?
He's going to hurt himself.
Nothing is prepared here for him.
The windows don't have screens on them.
There's furniture with edges on it.
This place is not safe for him.
His place is here. ln his own home...
-with his own family!
-Stop it!
What's going on? l don't know, Mom.
He's going to hurt himself on this. l told you that.
That's why he has the straitjacket.
We really shouldn't be doing this. lt's none of our business.
Take that damn straitjacket off him!
Come into the hall. l'll show you what l've got. lt is not a question of safety. lt is a question of caring!
Allen!
He's okay there. He won't fall, believe me.
Christ!
He's going to hurt himself.
He needs constant supervision and care.
He needs somebody watching him
24 hours a day.
-Bedtime.
-Okay.
We have no alternative but to place him in the institute.
We're going to have a coed volleyball game.
Dexter, set up over here, please.
Scott, the other court.
Quickly.
Quickly, quickly!
Come on.
Thanks.
-So what do you think?
-Oh, my God.
-What did you do to get that, Mona?
-l accepted his invitation to the fair...
-and he was overwhelmed with passion.
-The fair's over two months away.
You'd better start whipping your ass around campus now...
-or you'll wind up going with Eric there.
-You can fly to the fair with him.
Okay, girls. Cut the crap and warm up.
Will anybody volunteer to warm up with Eric?
Anyone?
Come on. l'll do it.
Thank you, Milly.
Remember, he won't catch the ball when you throw it to him.
-So just be gentle, but be persistent.
-Okay.
Thanks.
Okay, everybody.
Let's see some warm-ups!
Lauren, you take the ball out. lt's your turn to serve.
Hi, Eric.
Want to catch the ball?
Eric?
Hello?
Okay. l'll roll it to you, and you catch it, okay?
Eric... you can do it.
You've just got to try.
''Your son refuses to join in classroom activities.'' l'm not going to sing. No way!
''lf his behavior does not improve...
''we'll have to have a conference with the principal.''
Louis, how can you do this?
This is the first week.
You sign it.
You can do Mom's signature great.
''PS: Toy guns, knives, grenades and flame throwers...
-''are not allowed on the school premises.''
-Don't show it to Mom. l'll think about it.
Louis, could you get the dog?
Sure. Come on, Max. Come on, boy.
-l think l'm going to vacuum my room.
-Sounds good.
Yeah, l'll vacuum my room.
Mom will love it.
God.
Eric.
How'd you get in here?
Milly!
Milly, come quick.
The vacuum cleaner's eating my shirt!
Thanks.
What do you know about Eric?
Have you ever seen him do anything weird?
-That is all l've ever seen him do.
-No, l mean really weird.
Dinky Patterson told me something weird about him once.
Who's Dinky Patterson?
Dinky lived here before you, had your room.
Dinky used to get really annoyed with Eric climbing outside his window.
So he took his BB gun, stuffed the barrel with wet Kleenex...
-and started shooting at Eric.
-That's sweet.
He said he kept it up for about an hour.
But Eric wouldn't budge, so he gave up.
Here's the weird part.
The next day,
Dinky's looking around for his BB gun.
You know where he said he found it?
See that telephone pole?
Dinky said it was up there, up on top of that box.
That, somehow, Eric put it there.
Of course,
Dinky was the biggest liar l ever knew.
-lt probably never happened.
-Probably.
What happened to Dinky?
Why did he move?
His dad got some hotshot job in Atlanta.
Took the whole family.
So, where's your dad?
He died.
What of?.
Cancer.
Everyone in my family dies of cancer.
My grandmother had stomach cancer.
She lost 300 pounds before she died.
Never looked better in her life.
What kind did your dad have?
-l don't know.
-They didn't tell you.
They never tell the kids.
-Did it take a long time?
-Can we drop the subject?
-Sure.
-Thanks.
What were we talking about?
Eric?
Eric, get away from the edge!
What are we doing?
Hey, wait a minute!
Why are we doing this? l don't think we should be doing this.
Get your mother, Louis!
Are you sure you want to do this?
This may not be too good of an idea.
Milly? Hello?
Mom, come quick! Emergency situation!
Milly, careful.
Milly! l'm okay, Mom. Come on, Eric.
Honey, be careful.
-No problem, Mom.
-Where are you taking him?
There's a window over here. We're okay.
Mil?
You okay?
Milly?
-We're fine, you guys.
-All right! Way to go!
-You coming down?
-Yeah. Just a sec.
Eric... you're safer out on the windowsill, so don't go on the roof again, okay?
Something tells me you know what l'm saying.
You're just not letting on.
'Bye, Eric. You stay here.
Don't shake the floor, please.
There we go.
You see, you can't start on a bottle until the cork lands on its feet. lt's very frustrating when it takes a long time.
On the other hand, it's quite delightful when it happens on the first toss.
Care for a drink?
No. No, thank you.
-Are you calling me a drunk?
-No.
Why not?
Well, because it wouldn't be polite.
Polite.
Well, it's more polite to be called a drunk than a madman.
Wouldn't you agree?
Yeah, l guess so.
There you go. l do believe we haven't met.
My name's Hugo Gibb. l'm Milly Michaelson. l live next door.
Eric was out on the roof, so l helped him back inside.
What on earth possessed you to do that? l was afraid he would fall and get hurt.
Afraid he would fall?
Would you be afraid of a balloon falling?
Or a bubble dropping?
Or a feather fluttering to the ground?
No.
There you go. lt's past your bedtime, Louis, so make it quick.
Well, it was weird, that's all.
First your story about Eric and the BB gun.
Then Uncle Hugo telling me how Eric can't fall.
That's because Uncle Hugo does enough falling for the both of them. l hate people who can't hold their liquor.
Your mom's out for the evening. l have an idea.
Banana.
Nectarine.
Rum.
Will you give me some of that Tanqueray over there? l don't know about this. lf my mom knew--
Would you stop with ''if my mom knew''? lf l did everything my mom said, l'd be a nun. You're 14 years old. Live.
Okay.
-This looks, like, really disgusting.
-lt's like strawberries with a little....
Hey, to Uncle Hugo.
Look at him.
-Scary face.
-Yeah, very scary.
Give up, John. Admit who you are.
What?
Change the channel.
No.
This is romantic. lf Eric wasn't the way he is... would you... consider him handsome? l guess he'd be okay if he didn't have the brains of a goldfish.
-Geneva!
-What is it with you and Eric?
That's all you ever talk about.
You can't be in love with a retard. lt's just not done.
Well, what if he's fooling?
What if... a bad witch... put an evil spell on Eric... and all he needs... is the kiss of a young maiden... to turn him back into a prince?
That's beautiful.
'Bye, Geneva!
-'Bye, Milly!
-l love Geneva.
-l love you, too, Ma.
-Yeah, l know. l love... all the people... in all the world. l even love Louis tonight.
Are you mad at me, Mom?
No, l'll be mad at you in the morning when you're sober.
-Are you going to call me?
-Yeah, l will.
Milly.
Can l see you, dear?
Okay. Just a second, Mrs. Sherman.
Not now, Eric. l hear you've been helping Eric in his gym class. l just threw him the ball a couple of times.
-And you moved into the Patterson house.
-Yes.
-Have you met Eric's uncle?
-Yesterday.
Why don't you sit down, Milly?
Did he tell you that Eric could fly?
Yeah.
Then l guess you see what kind of guardian he must be. ln fact, if it hadn't been for my support... the state institute would have put Eric away long ago.
And that can't happen, Milly.
The state people mean well... but Eric can't exist in that kind of environment.
A while ago, his uncle went on a binge... and they did put Eric away for about a month.
He got sick... very sick.
He was dying.
No one knew why, but l was convinced... that he had just given up. l promised them then that l would watch over him.
But l can't be with him all the time.
Anyway... l was hoping maybe you'd help. l'll give you extra credits. lt can be your science project. l don't know anything about those kind of kids.
You don't have to.
All you have to do is be yourself.
Besides, what l saw out there... no doctor has ever been able to do with him.
He was following you, mimicking you... wanting to be like you.
Doctors haven't been able to get a word out of him.
Maybe a friend could.
Mrs. Sherman said l should keep a journal.
So here it goes.
Day number one: l sat in the back of the class with Eric for about an hour today. l figured that since he likes to copy me, l could teach him stuff.
But, somehow, it's not that simple.
He really doesn't understand.
He doesn't see the words, or even the book.
All he sees is me. l have the same problem with him in gym class.
He won't catch the ball or throw it.
He won't do anything on his own.
Milly.
Milly.
Say it.
Milly.
And, of course, he won't talk.
He won't smile, cry, or do anything, unless he's mimicking me. l have lunch with him every day.
Just him and me... right there in the middle of the schoolyard. l'm beginning to think this is a big mistake. lt's been two weeks since l started with Eric and nothing's really changed.
Sure, he imitates everything l do, but a parrot can do that. l'm like one of his airplanes, something to watch, to copy. lt's not as if we really communicate. lt's not as if l'm really a friend. l'm about to give up.
Day 21. Something happened today.
He smiled.
He didn't smile because l smiled.
He smiled because he wanted to.
Today, l finally saw something hiding behind those eyes.
Today l saw Eric.
Today we did things l thought he'd like. lt's working.
''He told them all the sad things that happened to Dumbo 'cause of his big ears.
''They flew down and offered to help.
''One of the crows took Timothy aside.
'''Flying's just like swimming,' he whispered.
'''lt's just a matter of believing that you can do it.'''
Day 33.
Just when everything was going well, it got better.
Okay. Ready?
Here we go.
Tommy! lt's time to go home!
Sic them!
Sic them!
No, no.
Right there. Hold this above your head.
There you go.
Hold it up, and don't let go till l tell you.
-Sic them!
-All right, let go!
All right. Let him hit it.
Watch out!
Milly, heads up!
You did it. Eric, you did it!
Every day Eric opens up a little bit more.
Every day he tells me a new secret. l don't know if he's becoming more like me... or l'm becoming more like him.
Somehow those differences don't seem to matter.
Sometimes l feel like l'm....
Do it again.
All right, Eric.
You're on.
Don't be nervous. You can do this. l know you can.
Right there.
You ready?
Catch it.
Now catch it.
Don't do this to me, Eric.
Put your hands up and catch it.
You can do it.
Catch it.
Okay. You ready?
Maybe you should try it again later.
No. He can do it.
Throw that as hard as you can at my face.
-Milly--
-No, don't worry about it. He'll catch it.
Maybe l should leave the country, change my name, or something.
How could you do all this?
Now l'm in big trouble.
-What did you do?
-l signed Mom's name... to all those notes from your teacher.
Now she's going to find out.
-You're right. You're in big trouble.
-Shut up.
Wonderful day, just wonderful.
Are you sure we have to give this to her?
That's probably her now.
Maybe she'll be in a good mood.
Eric, come on.
Hi, Mom.
-What's for dinner?
-Spaghetti.
Good.
That's only the fourth time this week.
What did you do to your eye?
-Somebody threw a ball at me.
-Who threw a ball at you?
Nobody, Mom. lt was an accident. lt's a black eye. lt will go away.
Be more careful.
You do stupid things, you're going to get yourself hurt.
How was work?
They made me executive assistant to Mr. Brandt.
Executive assistant. All right!
What does that mean, Mom? lt means l'm a glorified secretary. lt means l got demoted. lt means, l couldn't figure out how to work the computer.
-What's that?
-What?
Give me.
-He's in trouble.
-For what?
Disobeying his teacher, not doing homework... and not participating in class.
Why is this the first time l've heard about this? l didn't want to bother you with it.
Go to your room.
-Mom, l was framed.
-Go to your room!
Yes, ma'am. l thought you were supposed to be helping me.
-l am helping you.
-You call this helping?
Yes, l call this helping. l do everything for that little creep. l walk him home. l help him with his homework. l cook, l clean up, l do the dishes.
What do you do? l work.
Go to your room.
Honey, come on outside.
The hot dogs are almost ready.
Come on.
Louis, help your dad out.
Come on. l need some help.
-Hi!
-Hi.
Come on out.
Hello there, sports fans.
Hi. Welcome to the beautiful home of Donald and Charlene Michaelson.
A typical family doing the typical family things.
A family barbecue, our tradition since 1846.
Hi. l'm Donald Michaelson.
And l used to be like this.
Oh, l am going to....
-My knee's hurt!
-Oh my God, l'll help you. lt's a miracle! He's alive!
Let's go. The class is all ahead of us.
Move it. Left, right, left, right. Walk.
...indigenous to the rainforest.
Okay, is that everybody?
We'll just hold it here for a second.
Here we have reached a more temperate climate zone. l don't know if you know what that means.
A temperate zone is one where you have warm winters....
Sorry, cool winters and warm summers.
So the vegetation here is the vegetation that flourishes under those conditions.
We've got lantana and fuchsia.
All plants that do well in a temperate zone.
From this angle, too, you can see how high up the dome goes. lts height is 70 feet in the center at the highest point.
The actual area that it covers... is 15,386 square feet.
The diameter is 140 feet across....
Mona, you're not going to go up there.
You're going to fall, Mona.
You've got to get back.
Don't go up. Mona!
Oh, God, you freaked me out!
You are so strange. lt's okay, Eric. Don't worry.
Amelia!
Amelia!
Here we go.
She's coming around.
She's going to be fine.
No internal injuries.
She has a slight concussion. l think she'll sleep it off.
How did you get in here, Eric?
You caught me, didn't you?
You can fly?
What?
You are going to show me?
Eric!
Honey, what's the matter, sweetie? l was flying with Eric... l saw Dad, and Mona threw a ball at me, and l fell.
-lt was just a dream.
-No! l mean, yes, it was a dream.
But he caught me in real life.
What are you saying, sweetie?
He caught me.
Eric can fly.
He can really fly.
Mrs. Michaelson, Dr. Granada.
Oh, yes. Am l glad you're here. l'm really concerned. l'm sure you are.
-l'll go in and see Amelia now.
-Okay.
You stay here.
Thank you.
Dr. Reynolds, please report to Five West....
Amelia? l'm Dr. Granada.
May l come in?
Sure.
Dr. Nelson asked me to come by and see you. ls it okay if we talk a few minutes?
-Yeah.
-Good.
Tell me about your accident. l was on a bridge, reaching for a flower, and l fell over the railing.
You told your mother something about a boy who rescued you.
What are you, a shrink?
-Yes.
-Great. Now l'm wacko. lt's important that you tell me everything you remember about this.
Let me be the judge of whether you're wacko or not, okay?
Yeah, okay. l fell 50 feet without a mark on me, except for this.
And l got this when l hit the railing. l didn't hit the ground.
Somebody caught me. lt was a boy named Eric.
He can fly. l'm wacko, right?
No.
But did you see him fly?
No.
But you don't know Eric.
All he does is sit in his windowsill and pretend to fly.
His uncle says he's seen him do it... and l've seen really weird things around the house.
He can.
What other explanation could there be?
You fell.
You have a concussion.
You were losing consciousness.
Maybe what you thought was Eric catching you... was a tree or a bush breaking your fall.
Your mind could be playing tricks on you. lt can do that.
That's impossible. lt's more possible than a boy who could fly.
Dr. Nelson told me about your father.
He committed suicide not long ago.
He did not.
How did he die?
My father had cancer.
And when he found out... that he had it... he didn't want the rest of the family to suffer needlessly.
So one day... he kissed us all good-bye.
He said that he loved us very much.
Then he went away. lt's okay, Amelia.
Milly. lt's okay, Milly.
You know, sometimes we need to believe in a little magic.
Especially when there's so much pain. lt's normal.
And you're not wacko.
Come on, come here.
Louis, get Max off her.
-Glad you're back, Mil.
-l missed you, too.
Now you can do the dishes.
Come here.
Did you miss me?
Did you miss me when l was gone? l missed you.
Silly bird.
Hey, guys, how about we go out for dinner?
Sounds great, Mom.
Eric.
Mr. Gibb. l'm sorry, Milly. Don't be angry. l'm not angry. lt's just that sometimes l see things. l've seen things, too.
Where's Eric?
He's gone.
Those people came over, but l was drinking.
So they took him away. l guess l messed up things pretty good.
Mr. Gibb, what do you mean?
Mr. Gibb!
Nurse Corbett, would you please report to Ward 6?
Have Dr. Wilding call me when he comes in.
-Excuse me.
-Just a second.
Yes?
-We're here to see a patient.
-Name, please.
Gibb. Eric Gibb.
G-l-B-B.
Let me see that. Come over here.
Sit down here.
Play with this, okay? l'm sorry, Mrs. Michaelson.
Only relatives are allowed to see this patient.
We're his only friends. We live next door. l'm sorry.
Our rules are very clear on the matter.
-Listen, lady....
-Louis! l got to talk to him, Mom. l want to see if he's okay.
Don't worry. This isn't over yet.
We'll make some calls.
Mom, is everyone in there like Eric... or are they all different kinds of crazy people?
What if we talk to Mrs. Sherman?
Maybe she'd know what to do.
We'll give her a call.
What do you think you're doing?
Give me a hand here!
Watch his legs.
-Get the restraints.
-Right away.
Sic, them!
No, not me, you idiot!
Soldier Boy! Get him!
You're dead!
Let's get him!
-What a wimp!
-Come on. We did it.
Let's go. Let's get out of here!
There you are.
What the hell were you doing over there?
Get over here, now! l said now!
Max!
No!
Hey, kid. How're you doing?
Water's running right through your graveyard.
Going to wash all the men away. l don't need them anyhow. They're dead.
Thinking about Max?
That stupid dog. He was dumb.
Couldn't learn a thing.
We should've got rid of him a long time ago.
Louis, the vet said he had a good chance to pull through.
You got to... think positive.
How can you be a good soldier if you don't think positive? l don't want to be a good soldier. l'm no good at it. l can't even get around the block.
What should l think positive for?
You fall on your head,
Eric's in the loony bin... and Max is going to die. l give up. l quit.
Dad did.
He did not.
He didn't even try, Milly.
Why didn't he try?
Why? l don't know, Louis.
Maybe he was scared.
But we can't give up.
We've got to try.
That junk doesn't work.
You should tell it to people like your dumb old Eric.
He doesn't even have the brains to know he's messed up. lt doesn't matter if he's out there or at the funny farm.
He just sits there and flies.
Maybe that's what l should do.
-Louis, what are you doing?
-l'm going to be just like Eric.
-l'm gonna sit on the sill--
-Louis, stop it.
No one's gonna stop me. l'll fly like Eric.
-l said stop it!
-No!
Louis, come on.
Go away!
-What's going on?
-l don't know, Mom.
He's over there, Mom.
No, l got to find them!
They're in here somewhere. l've got them. No problem.
Okay, sweetie, let's go.
Can l sleep with you tonight, Mommy?
Okay, honey.
Let's just get you dried off first. ln you go.
Eric!
Eric?
We were having some problems with my son.
Our dog got hurt.
And he was very upset, so l took him to my bedroom... and he spent the night with me.
And l was so involved with him... l just assumed that she was home.
But this morning, her bed wasn't even slept in.
She's a little smaller than l am.
She's about 5'2'' or 5'3''.
She has blue eyes and sandy hair.
She's very pretty.
-Yeah?
-Mr. Gibb? lt seems your nephew Eric is missing.
No. He ain't here.
-Do you mind if we just look around?
-Eric, wake up.
We've got to get out of here. Come on.
Go right ahead.
Come on.
He's not in his room.
Told you.
-What's up there?
-Attic.
-Want to look?
-Yeah, why don't you check it out?
Mister!
Looking for Eric and Milly? There they go.
Pretty girl!
Catch.
Okay, you get three. Okay?
Excuse me, Miss D?
Do you know where Mrs. Sherman is?
She was in the teachers' lounge, last l saw her.
-Thanks a lot.
-Yeah, okay.
Eric.
Not bad.
And then the next thing we knew, he was gone. l don't know where.
Eric, Milly, come back!
Hey, you kids, hold it right there.
Hold it. Wait. lt's okay, little girl.
Eric?
Milly! Dan, over here.
Milly.
Can you really fly, Eric?
Milly!
No!
You did it!
Look up there!
One....
Get out of the way!
Hey, Gibb!
Milly!
Mom!
-What is it? Explain it.
-Look!
Hi, Geneva!
They're flying! This is great!
Go tell your mom!
Oh, my God! You look great!
This is fantastic! l don't believe it. You look fantastic!
Uncle Hugo, my sister can fly!
That's good, Louis.
See, l told you.
Mom!
Hi, Geneva.
Hey, Lou.
Eric?
Good... bye...
Milly. l... love... you.
Eric?
That night l found out why Eric flew away.
Our house was crawling with people who wanted to see Eric Gibb... the boy who could fly.
There were scientists and doctors and TV reporters.
Full color T-shirts of Eric Gibb, the flying boy.
When they couldn't find Eric, they did tests on me... because l flew with him.
They did tests on Uncle Hugo, too... because he was a relative and had the same genes.
Then they took everything out of his room and sent it to some laboratory. l guess Eric was afraid they'd do the same to him.
The children, in an adolescent sexual frenzy... somehow mesmerized the crowd....
Everyone had a theory on how Eric was able to fly.
But there was one l liked the best.
Eric always dreamed of flying, so maybe if you wish hard enough... and love long enough, anything's possible.
Mrs. Sherman was right.
Eric made us believe that anything is possible if you really try.
Uncle Hugo stopped drinking.
He even went out and got a job.
Max got better.
He was weak and sore and broken up.
But he was going to be okay.
Mom locked herself in a room for a day and figured out that computer.
And then there was Louis.
There was no stopping him.
You stay here, Max. l got to do this alone.
-Sonny, it's Michaelson!
-Get him!
-All right!
-We got him!
So you thought you could get around the block?
Go ahead. Make my day. l'm supposed to be real scared of a water pistol?
Ain't no water in this gun.
So what's in it?
Piss.
Shit!
Hitler! Sic him!
Way to go, Max!
All right!
Mom, Milly! We did it! lt's been a while since we flew, and Eric hasn't come back.
But somehow he's still a big part of our lives.
He made us believe in ourselves again.
Now when l feel like giving up, not trying... all l have to do is think about him and what he taught me. l was telling Geneva just the other day... we're all special.
We're all a little like Eric.
Maybe we can't soar up into the clouds... but somewhere... deep inside... we can all fly.
DVDRip & Subtitles By Mitt

Give me the child.
Through dangers untold and hardships unnumbered...
...I have fought my way to the castle beyond the Goblin City...
...to take back the child that you have stolen.
For my will is as strong as yours...
...and my kingdom is as great.
For my will is as strong as yours, my kingdom as great.
Damn.
I can never remember that line.
"You have no power over me."
Oh, Merlin.
Oh, no, Merlin.
I don't believe it. It's 7:00!
Come on. Come on!
It's not fair!
Oh, really.
- I'm sorry.
- Don't stand in the rain. Come on.
All right. Come on, Merlin.
- Come on.
- Not the dog.
- But it's pouring.
- Go on, into the garage.
Go on, Merlin.
Go into the garage.
Go.
- Sarah, you're an hour late.
- I said I'm sorry!
Please let me finish.
- Your father and I go out rarely.
- You go out every single weekend.
I ask you to babysit only if it won't interfere with your plans.
You don't know what my plans are.
You don't even ask me anymore.
I assume you'd tell me you had a date.
I'd like it if you had a date.
- You should have dates at your age.
- Sarah, you're home.
- We were worried about you.
- I can't do anything right, can I?
She treats me like a wicked stepmother in a fairy story no matter what I say.
I'll talk to her.
Through dangers untold...
...and hardships unnumbered...
...I have fought my way here to the castle...
...beyond the Goblin City...
...to take back the child...
...that you have stolen.
- Sarah? Can I talk to you?
- There's nothing to talk about!
Hurry. You're gonna be late.
Listen, we fed Toby and put him to bed.
We do have to leave now, but we'll be back around midnight.
You really wanted to talk to me, didn't you?
Practically broke down the door.
Lancelot!
Someone has been in my room again.
I hate that. I hate it!
I hate you. I hate you!
Someone save me, take me away from this awful place!
What do you want?
You want a story, huh?
Okay.
Once upon a time there was a beautiful, young girl...
...whose stepmother always made her stay home with the baby.
The baby was a spoiled child and wanted everything for himself...
...and the young girl was practically a slave.
But what no one knew...
...was that the king of the goblins had fallen in love with the girl...
...and he had given her certain powers.
So one night...
...when the baby had been particularly cruel to her...
...she called on the goblins for help.
Listen.
"Say your right words," the goblins said.
"And we'll take the baby to the Goblin City...
...and you will be free."
But the girl knew that the king of the goblins...
...would keep the baby in his castle forever and ever and ever...
...and turn it into a goblin.
So the girl suffered in silence...
...until one night, when she was tired from a day of housework...
...and she was hurt by the harsh words of her stepmother...
...and she could no longer stand it...
All right! All right!
Knock it off. Come on.
Stop it! Stop it!
I'll say the words.
No, I mustn't. I mustn't say.
I wish... I wish...
- Is she going to say it?
- Say what?
- Shut up.
- Sorry.
You shut up.
Listen.
She's going to say the words.
I can bear it no longer!
Goblin King, Goblin King, wherever you may be...
...take this child of mine far away from me!
That's not it.
Where'd she learn that rubbish?
It doesn't even start with, "I wish."
Toby, stop it!
I wish I did know what to say to make the goblins take you away.
"I wish the goblins would come and take you away right now."
That's not hard, is it?
I wish...
- Did she say it?
- Shut up!
I wish the goblins would come and take you away.
Right now.
Toby?
Toby, are you all right?
Why aren't you crying?
You're him, aren't you?
You're the Goblin King.
I want my brother back, please, if it's all the same.
What's said is said.
But I didn't mean it.
- You didn't?
- Please.
Where is he?
You know very well where he is.
Please bring him back. Please.
Sarah...
...go back to your room...
...play with your toys and your costumes.
Forget about the baby.
I can't.
I've brought you a gift.
- What is it?
- It's a crystal...
...nothing more.
But if you turn it this way...
...look into it...
...it'll show you your dreams.
But this is not a gift for an ordinary girl...
...who takes care of a screaming baby.
Do you want it?
Then forget the baby.
I can't.
I appreciate what you're trying to do for me, but I want my brother back.
- He must be so scared.
- Sarah.
Don't defy me.
You're no match for me.
But I have to have my brother back.
He's there, in my castle.
Do you still want to look for him?
Is that the castle beyond the Goblin City?
Turn back, Sarah.
Turn back before it's too late.
I can't.
Don't you understand that I can't?
What a pity.
It doesn't look that far.
It's further than you think.
Time is short.
You have 13 hours in which to solve the labyrinth...
...before your baby brother...
...becomes one of us...
...forever.
Such a pity.
The labyrinth.
It doesn't look that hard.
Well, come on, feet.
- Excuse me?
- Excuse me!
It's you.
Excuse me, but I have to get through this labyrinth. Can you help me?
How sweet.
Fifty-seven!
- How could you?
- Yeah.
Poor thing.
You monster.
It bit me!
What did you expect fairies to do?
I thought they did nice things, like granting wishes.
Shows what you know, don't it?
- Fifty-eight.
- You're horrible.
Huh? No, I ain't.
I'm Hoggle. Who are you?
- Sarah.
- That's what I thought.
Fifty-nine.
Do you know where the door to the labyrinth is?
- Maybe.
- Where is it?
You little...
Sixty!
- I said, where is it?
- Where is what?
- The door.
- What door?
- It's hopeless asking you anything.
- Not if you ask the right questions.
How do I get into the labyrinth?
Now that's more like it.
You gets in there.
You really going in there, are you?
Yes.
I'm afraid I have to.
Cosy, isn't it?
Now, would you go left or right?
- They both look the same.
- Well, you're not gonna get very far.
- Which way would you go?
- Me?
I wouldn't go either way.
If that's all the help you're gonna be, you can just leave.
You know your problem?
You take too many things for granted.
Take this labyrinth...
...even if you get to the centre, you'll never get out again.
- That's your opinion.
- It's a lot better than yours.
Thanks for nothing, Hogwart.
It's Hoggle!
And don't say I didn't warn you.
What do they mean, "labyrinth"?
There aren't any turns or corners.
It just goes on and on.
Maybe it doesn't.
Maybe I'm just taking it for granted that it does.
'Allo.
Did you say "hello"?
No, I said, "'Allo," but that's close enough.
- You're a worm, aren't you?
- Yeah, that's right.
You don't by any chance know the way through this labyrinth?
Who, me?
No, I'm just a worm.
Come inside, meet the missus.
No, thank you, but I have to solve this labyrinth.
But there aren't any turns or any openings or anything.
It just goes on and on.
You ain't looking right. It's full of openings, but you ain't seeing them.
- Where are they?
- There's one just across there.
It's right in front of you.
No, there isn't.
Come inside and have a nice cup of tea.
- But there isn't an opening.
- Of course there is.
You try walking through it.
You'll see what I mean.
- What?
- Go on then.
That's just wall.
There's no way through.
Things are not always what they seem in this place.
So you can't take anything for granted.
Hey!
- Hang on.
- Thank you.
- That was incredibly helpful.
- Don't go that way.
- What was that?
- I said don't go that way.
Never go that way.
Thanks.
If she had kept on going down that way...
...she'd had gone straight to that castle.
Toby.
I'm coming, Toby.
Give me back this!
Go on, get off me.
Stay out of the way.
What are you talking about?
Walk, walk, walk.
- You remind me of the babe.
- What babe?
- The babe with the power.
- What power?
- The power of voodoo.
- Who do?
- You do.
- Do what?
Remind me of the babe.
Quiet! A goblin babe.
Well?
Hey, what goes on?
Your mother is an aardvark!
In nine hours and 23 minutes...
...you'll be mine.
- You got it?
- I got it.
Good.
Oh, no.
Someone has been changing my marks.
What a horrible place this is.
It's not fair!
That's right. It's not fair.
But that's only half of it.
- This was a dead end a minute ago.
- No, that's the dead end behind you.
It keeps changing.
What am I supposed to do?
The only way out of here is to try one of these doors.
One of them leads to the castle at the centre of the labyrinth.
And the other one leads to...
...certain death.
Which one is which?
- We can't tell you.
- Why not?
- We don't know.
- But they do.
Then I'll ask them.
No, you can't ask us.
You can only ask one of us.
It's in the rules.
And I should warn you...
...one of us always tells the truth, and one of us always lies.
That's a rule too.
He always lies.
- I do not. I tell the truth.
- What a lie.
He's the liar.
All right. Answer yes or no.
Would he tell me that this door leads to the castle?
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
Yes.
Then the other door leads to the castle...
...and this door leads to certain death.
How do you know?
He could be telling the truth.
But then you wouldn't be.
So if you told me that he said yes,
I know the answer is no.
- But I could be telling the truth.
- But then he would be lying.
So if you told me that he said yes,
I know the answer would still be no.
Wait a minute. Is that right?
I don't know.
I've never understood it.
No, it's right.
I've figured it out.
I could never do it before.
I think I'm getting smarter.
This is a piece of cake.
Help!
Stop it! Help!
What do you mean, "help"?
We are helping.
We're helping hands.
You're hurting.
Would you like us to let go?
No!
Well then, come on, which way?
Which way?
Up or down?
Come on, come on.
We haven't got all day.
Well, it's a big decision for her.
Which way do you want to go?
Yes, which way?
Well, since I'm pointed that way,
I guess I'll go down.
She chose down.
She chose down?
- Was that wrong?
- Too late now.
She's in the oubliette.
Shut up! She should not have gotten as far as the oubliette.
- She should have given up by now.
- She'll never give up.
Won't she? The dwarf's about to lead her back to the beginning.
She'll soon give up when she realises she has to start all over again.
Well, laugh.
Who's there?
Me.
- It's you.
- Yes, well...
...I knew you were gonna get into trouble as soon as I met you.
So I've come to give you a hand.
You're looking around now, aren't you?
I suppose you noticed there ain't no doors.
Only the hole.
This is an oubliette.
The labyrinth's full of them.
- Really? How do you know that?
- Don't sound so smart.
- You don't know what an oubliette is.
- Do you?
Yes, it's a place you put people to forget about them.
Now, what you've gotta do is get out of here.
And it so happens that I know a shortcut...
...out of the whole labyrinth from here.
No, I'm not giving up now.
I've come too far.
- No, I'm doing okay.
- Of course you are.
But it gets a lot worse from here on in.
Why are you so concerned about me?
Well, I am, that's all.
Nice, young girl.
Terrible, black oubliette.
You like jewellery, don't you?
Why?
If you help me solve the labyrinth,
I'll give you this.
You like it, don't you?
So-so.
Okay.
Tell you what...
...give me the bracelet and I'll show you the way out of the labyrinth.
- You were gonna do that anyway.
- Yes, well...
...that would make it a particularly nice gesture on your part.
No. I'll tell you what...
...if you won't take me to the centre, take me as far as you can.
- Then I'll do it on my own.
- What is that anyway?
Plastic.
I don't promise nothing, but...
...l'll take you as far as I can.
Then you're on your own, right?
- Right.
- Right.
Plastic!
Here we go.
Damn.
Broom closet.
Well, can't be right all the time.
This is it. Come on then.
- This way.
- Don't go on.
Go back while you still can.
This is not the way.
Take heed and go no further.
Beware. Beware.
Soon it will be too late.
Don't pay any attention to them.
They're just false alarms.
You get a lot of them in the labyrinth.
Especially when you're on the right track.
- Oh, no, you're not.
- Shut up.
- Sorry. Just doing my job.
- You don't have to do it to us.
- Beware for...
- Just forget it.
Please, I haven't said it for such a long time.
All right, but don't expect a big reaction.
No, no, no, of course not.
For the path you will take will lead to certain destruction.
Thank you very much.
Oh, no.
What have we here?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
Nothing? Nothing?
Nothing, tra-la-la?
Your Majesty, what a nice surprise.
- Hello, Hedgewart.
- Hogwart.
Hoggle!
Hoggle, can it be that you're helping this girl?
Helping? In what sense?
In the sense that you're leading her towards the castle.
No, I was taking her back to the beginning, Your Majesty.
What?
I told her I was gonna help her solve the labyrinth...
...a little trickery on my part, but actually...
What is that plastic thing round your wrist?
Oh, this?
My goodness, where did this come from?
- Higgle...
- Hoggle.
If I thought for one second that you were betraying me...
...l'd be forced to suspend you headfirst in the Bog of Eternal Stench.
No, Your Majesty!
Not the Eternal Stench!
Yes, Hoggle!
And you, Sarah.
How are you enjoying my labyrinth?
It's a piece of cake.
Really? Then how about upping the stakes.
That's not fair!
You say that so often.
I wonder what your basis for comparison is.
So the labyrinth's a piece of cake, is it?
Well, let's see how you deal with this little slice.
No, the cleaners!
- What?
- Run!
You okay?
Come on!
Faster!
Oh, no.
The cleaners!
The Bog of Stench!
You sure got his attention.
This is what we need...
...a ladder. Follow me.
How can I trust you now that I know you were taking me back to the beginning?
I wasn't.
I told him I was taking you back to the beginning to throw him off the scent.
Hoggle, how can I believe anything you say?
Well, let me put it this way.
What choice have you got?
You're right.
You see, you've gotta understand my position.
I'm a coward, and Jareth scares me.
- What kind of position is that?
- No position. That's my point.
You wouldn't be so brave if you'd ever smelled...
...the Bog of Eternal Stench.
It's... It's...
Is that all it does, is smell?
Believe me, that's enough.
But the worst thing is, if you so much...
...as put a foot in the Bog of Stench...
...you'll smell bad for the rest of your life.
It'll never wash off.
Here we are then.
You're on your own from now on.
- What?
- That's it. I quit.
Wait a minute. Hoggle!
I didn't promise nothing. I said
I'd take you as far as I could go.
You little cheat.
You nasty, little cheat.
Don't try to embarrass me.
I've got no pride.
Oh, yeah?
But them's my jewels!
You give them back!
Give them back. Give those back.
Give those back to me!
Now, there's the castle.
Which way should we try?
Them's my rightful property.
It's not fair!
No, it isn't.
But that's the way it is.
Excuse me, please, but can you help me?
A young girl!
And who is this?
- My friend.
- Well, yes.
And what can I do for you?
Please, can you tell...?
That is...
I have to get to the castle at the centre. Do you know the way?
Well, yes, now.
You want to get to the castle.
How's that for brainpower, huh?
Be quiet!
Ah, nuts.
So, young woman...
...the way forward is sometimes the way back.
Will you listen to this crap?
- Will you please be quiet?!
- Sorry. All right.
- Okay?
- Okay!
- All right.
- All right!
- What?
- Sorry.
Finished?
Yes.
Quite often, young lady...
...it seems like we're not getting anywhere, when in fact...
- We are.
- We are.
I'm certainly not getting anywhere at the moment.
Join the club.
I think that's your lot.
Please leave a contribution in the little box.
Don't you dare! Them's mine.
Well, I guess I can spare this.
You didn't have to give him that.
He didn't tell you nothing.
Well then, there go a couple of suckers.
It's so stimulating being your hat.
Why did you say that...
...about my being your friend?
Because you are.
You may not be much of a friend...
...but you're the only one I've got in this place.
Do you hear something?
- No, it's all right.
- Friend.
I like that.
I ain't never been no one's friend before.
- Goodbye!
- Wait a minute.
- Keep the stuff.
- Are you my friend or not?
No, I'm not.
Hoggle ain't no one's friend.
He looks after himself, like everyone.
Hoggle is Hoggle's friend.
Hoggle, you coward!
Well, I'm not afraid.
Things aren't always what they seem in this place.
Try on this for size, you big yeti!
We've got you now, fuzzball!
All together now.
If only I had something to throw.
Sock it to him!
Sock it to him!
What happened? Who turned out the light? I can't see!
- Why'd you bite me?
- Who bite who?
Who bite me? Who bite me?
- I can't see!
- What is going on?
Retreat!
Who bit me?
My aching sushi!
Now, stop that.
Is that any way to treat someone who's trying to help you?
Don't you want me to help you down?
Ludo down.
Ludo?
Is that your name?
Ludo.
You seem like such a nice beast.
Well, I certainly hope you are what you seem to be.
Just hang on.
I'll get you down.
Just a second.
I'm sorry!
Ludo, are you hurt?
Ludo?
Friend?
That's right, Ludo.
I'm Sarah.
Sarah.
Here, let me help you.
Are you okay?
Sarah. Sarah friend.
Now, wait. Just a second.
- I want to ask you something, Ludo.
- What?
I have to get to the castle at the labyrinth's centre.
Do you know the way?
- No.
- You don't know either, huh?
I wonder if anyone knows how to get through this labyrinth.
Get through the labyrinth.
Get through the labyrinth.
One thing for sure. She'll never get through the labyrinth.
Hey.
Where did they come from?
What do you think?
Which shall we choose out of these two ugly characters?
It's very rude to stare!
I'm sorry. I was just wondering which door to choose.
- What?
- It's no good asking him.
- He's deaf as a post.
- Don't talk with your mouth full.
- I'm not talking with my mouth full!
- Wait a second.
- I can't understand you.
- What were you saying?
- It is so good to get that thing out.
- What were you saying?
I said, it's no good talking to him.
He's deaf as a post.
Mumble, mumble. You're a wonderful conversational companion.
You can talk!
All you do is moan!
No good. Can't hear you.
- Where do these doors lead?
- What?
Search me.
We're just the knockers.
- How do I get through?
- Huh?
Knock, and the door will open.
Ludo.
I don't want that thing back in my mouth.
Come on. I want to knock.
Doesn't want his ring back in his mouth, eh? Can't say I blame him.
- Sorry.
- That's all right. I'm used to it.
Come on, Ludo.
You're welcome.
He's a lively little chap.
I think I'll call him Jareth.
He's got my eyes.
Ludo scared.
Give me your hand.
Come on.
Imagine a big thing like you being scared.
Yeah.
See, Ludo? There's nothing to be afraid of.
Ludo?
Ludo, where are you?
Ludo?
Hoggle, help!
- I'm coming, Sarah.
- Well, if it isn't you.
And where are you going?
Well, the little lady gave me the slip...
...but I just hears her now.
So I was about to lead her back to the beginning...
...like you told me.
- I see.
- Ludo!
For one moment I thought you were running to help her.
But no, not after my warnings.
- That would be stupid.
- You bet it would!
Me help her after your warnings?
- Oh, dear. Poor Hoghead.
- Hoggle.
I've just noticed your lovely jewels are missing.
Yes, so they are.
My lovely jewels. Let me think.
I better find them, but first
I'm off to take the little lady...
...back to the beginning of the labyrinth like we planned.
Wait.
I've got a much better plan.
Give her this.
What is it?
It's a present.
It ain't gonna hurt the little lady, is it?
Why the concern?
- I won't do nothing to harm her.
- Come, come, Hogbrain.
I'm surprised at you losing your head over a girl.
I ain't lost my head.
You don't think a young girl could ever like...
...a repulsive little scab like you, do you?
- She said we was...
- What?
Bosom companions?
Friends?
- Don't matter.
- You'll give her that...
...or I'll tip you straight into the Bog of Eternal Stench...
...before you can blink.
Yes. Right.
And Hoggle...
...if she ever kisses you,
I'll turn you into a prince.
You...? You will?
Prince of the Land of Stench.
Ludo?
What's going on?
- What do you want?
- What, us?
We just have to have a good time.
That's right!
Like the man said, don't lose your head.
Hey, I'm a wild child.
Walk tall.
Roll 'em.
Snake eyes!
Hey, lady!
Fore!
Bad luck.
Hey, listen up.
Shake your pretty little head.
Tap your pretty little feet.
Come on! Come on!
Hey, hey!
Her head don't come off.
Of course it doesn't!
- She's right. It's stuck on.
- Hey, lady.
Where you going with a head like that?
Hey, man, I know what we can do.
Take off her head!
Yeah, let's take her apart.
Lady, that's his head.
- That's my head!
- That's a friend of mine.
What are you doing?
Hey, lady...
...it's against the rules to throw other people's heads.
You're only allowed to throw your own head.
Yeah, that's right.
Where's the referee?
Now we got to take your head off.
- Stop her. Somebody stop her.
- Come back, little lady.
- Play the game.
- Yeah, we're going to throw your head.
You can't quit.
The game's not over.
- Hey, lady!
- Leave me alone!
- We get a free throw.
- Don't you want to take your head off?
- Sure she does.
- Grab it!
- Don't you want to look like us?
- Leave me alone.
It won't hurt! Get a saw!
If you play, we'll take off your arms!
- Take off your ear.
- You don't need two ears.
- Game's almost over.
- Down's up.
- Go away.
- Hoggle, you've come to help me.
Don't kiss me! Don't kiss me!
No, no, no!
Hoggle, hold on.
Oh, my God.
What is it?
The Bog of Eternal Stench!
I've never smelled anything like it.
It's like...
It doesn't matter what it's like.
It's a Bog of Eternal Stench.
Help!
Hold on.
What did you have to go and do a thing like that for?
Do what?
- You mean rescue you?
- What? No.
You kissed me.
Oh, my gosh.
Don't pretend to be so hard.
I know you came back to help me, and I know that you're my friend.
Did not. Am not.
I just come to get me property back.
Oh, and...
...give you...
Give me what?
Ludo!
Smell!
Where's Hoggle?
Get off of me!
Here.
Hoggle.
No, it's okay.
This is Ludo. He's a friend too.
A what?
Smell!
You're right.
Oh, my God.
There's a bridge.
Come on.
Watch it.
You step in this stuff and you'll stink forever.
Stop!
- Stop, I say.
- Please, we have to get across.
Without my permission, no one may cross.
Please, I only have a little time left!
We've gotta get out of this stench.
Smell bad.
- Stench? Of what speaketh thou?
- This smell.
- I smell nothing.
- You're joking.
But I live by my sense of smell.
The air is sweet and fragrant, and none may pass without my permission!
Smell bad.
Get out of my way!
I warn thee,
I'm sworn to do my duty!
- Come on. Let us get across.
- Hold!
Listen, I don't want to have to hurt you.
What are you doing?
Let go of my staff, sir!
All right then.
I can conquer this mountain.
Thou must do better than that.
Give up? Huh?
Enough!
Before this day, never have I met my match in battle.
Yet this noble knight has fought me to a standstill.
- Are you all right, Ludo?
- Smell!
Sir Ludo, if that's thy name, now I, Sir Didymus, yield to thee.
Come, let us be brothers henceforth...
...and fight for the right as one!
- Thank you very much.
- Ludo get brother.
Steady.
- Well met, Sir Ludo.
- Good. Come on.
Wait a minute!
You forget my sacred vow, my lady.
- I cannot let you pass.
- But you said Ludo is your brother.
I have taken an oath, and I must defend it to the death.
- The smell!
- Okay.
Let's handle this thing logically.
What exactly have you sworn?
I have sworn with my lifeblood no one shall pass this way...
...without my permission.
Well, may we have your permission?
Well, I...
- Yes?
- Thank you, noble sir.
My lady.
Have no fear, sweet lady.
This bridge has lasted for a thousand years.
- It seemed solid enough.
- Hoggle!
Fear not, fair maiden.
I will save thee.
Somehow.
Sir Ludo, canst thou sit by and howl when yon maiden needs our help?
- That's incredible, Ludo.
- My brother!
Canst thou summon up the very rocks?
Sure. Rocks friends.
Hoggle.
- Here.
- Thanks, Hoggle.
Be careful, Ludo.
Sir Ludo, wait for me.
Ambrosius, it's all right.
You can come out now.
Come on. Thattaboy.
My loyal steed. Steady.
Forward. Steady, boy.
Come on, Ambrosius.
Just close your eyes and go.
Let's get out of here.
Excuse us. Thank you.
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.
Please, I can't give it to her.
Come on then. We should reach the castle well before day.
Look, Sarah, is this what you're trying to find?
So much trouble over such a little thing, but not for long.
She'll soon forget all about you, my fine fellow.
Just as soon as Hoggle gives her my present...
...then she'll forget everything.
Is that my stomach or yours,
Ambrosius?
Hungry.
Yeah. Well, we can't stop now.
Maybe we can find some berries or something.
Sarah.
Yeah?
Here.
Hoggle. Thank you!
You're a lifesaver.
This tastes strange.
- Hoggle, what have you done?
- Damn you, Jareth.
And damn me too.
Everything's dancing.
Yea, verily.
Whoa, Ambrosius, whoa!
The castle doth lie yonder, my lady.
My lady?
My lady? My lady?
She'll never forgive me.
What have I done?
I've lost my only friend.
That's what I've done.
What was I doing?
Get off my back!
Why don't you look where you're going...
...young woman?
- I was looking.
- Huh? Huh?
Where were you going?
I don't remember.
You can't look where you're going if you don't know where you're going.
I was searching for something.
Well, look here.
Lancelot?
Thank you.
That's what you were looking for.
Wasn't it, my dear?
Yes. I forgot.
Now, why don't you...
...come in here...
...and see if there's anything else...
...you'd like.
It was just a dream.
I dreamed it all, Lancelot.
But it was so real.
Let's go see if Daddy's back, okay?
Better to stay in here, dear.
Yes.
There's nothing you want out there. No! No.
What have we got here?
Lancelot.
Your bunny rabbit.
You like your little bunny rabbit.
Don't you? Yes, yes.
There you go.
There's Betsy Boo.
You remember Betsy Boo, don't you?
Yes, yes.
Now then, what else have we got?
What's this? Let's have a look.
It's a pencil box.
Got lots of pencils in it too.
Here's your panda slippers.
You know how much you like them.
You never wanted them thrown away.
There they are. That's right.
Okay. Now then, what else?
It's little Horsy.
You love little Horsy, don't you, dear?
And look at this!
You got a printing game, you have.
Here's a treasure.
You'll want that. Won't you, my dear?
Yes, go on. Put it on.
Make yourself up.
Here's dear old Flopsy.
You'll want her. There you go.
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
Charlie Bear. Right.
There's Charlie Bear for you.
There was something
I was looking for.
Don't talk nonsense.
It's all here.
Everything you've ever cared about is all right here.
There's your little toy candy shop.
"Through dangers untold...
...and hardships unnumbered...
...I fought my way here to the castle...
...beyond the Goblin City...
...to take back the child that you have stolen."
What's the matter, my dear?
Don't you like your toys?
It's all junk.
Well, what about this?
This is not junk, eh?
Yes, it is!
I have to save Toby!
My lady!
- Sarah? Sarah.
- Are you all right?
- My lady.
- Sarah.
Fair maiden. Thank goodness thou art safe at last.
- Where are we?
- Sarah back.
My lady, we're almost there.
Those are the gates to the Goblin City.
Ludo, Sir Didymus.
Let's go quickly.
We don't have much time.
- Yeah.
- Right, Ambrosius.
Forward.
No, no!
Open up. Open the door.
Sir Didymus, we must go quietly.
Open up. Open up right now!
You'll wake the guard.
Quiet.
Well, let them all wake up!
I shall fight you all to the death!
Please, Sir Didymus, for my sake, hush.
But of course.
For thee, anything.
- But I'm not a coward?
- No.
- And my sense of smell is keen?
- Oh, yes.
Then I shall fight anyone anywhere, any place, anytime!
We know!
Now hush.
Quietly.
Ambrosius, be quiet now.
I don't see why we have to be so quiet.
It's only a Goblin City.
I smell trouble.
Come on, Ludo.
Oh, no.
What is that?
Who goes?
Watch out!
Ambrosius.
Ambrosius, will you come here?
Ambrosius, come here right now!
Will you please come?
Oh, but you're embarrassing me.
Ludo.
Hoggle!
Look out!
Get out of there.
What are you doing?
Bombs away!
That wasn't very nice.
My turn now.
How do you drive this thing?
Drop the axe!
I'm trying.
Come here at once.
Where's reverse?
Get out of there, Hoggle!
Abandon ship.
Hoggle!
Hoggle, are you all right?
I'm not asking to be forgiven.
I ain't ashamed of nothing I did.
Jareth made me give you that peach.
I don't care what you think of me.
I told you I was a coward.
I ain't interested in being friends.
I forgive you, Hoggle.
You...? You do?
And I commend you.
Rarely have I seen such courage.
You are a valiant man,
Sir Hoggle.
I am?
Hoggle and Ludo friends.
We are?
Here are your things, Hoggle.
Thanks for your help.
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's get the rat who calls himself Jareth.
Right. Come on.
Ambrosius, it's safe now.
Nothing to be afraid of.
Your Highness!
Your Highness, the girl...
- What?
...who ate the peach...
...and forgot everything...
- What of her?
She's here with the monster,
Sir Didymus and the dwarf.
- What?
- They're on their way to the castle!
Stop her! Call out the guards.
Take the baby and hide it.
- Guards!
- She must be stopped.
Do something!
Come on, move. Move!
- I think we're gonna make it.
- Piece of cake.
Company, halt.
Lances ready!
Cannon, fire!
Ambrosius, turn around.
Turn about.
- Quick, this way.
- All right. Charge!
No, not that way!
You're going the wrong way!
The battle's behind us!
Ambrosius, can we please talk about this?
Sit!
Be careful. Okay.
Through here.
Ambrosius, stand still.
Okay, come on, guys.
Ambrosius, if you don't turn around this second...
...I will never feed you again.
That's better.
Don't worry, Ambrosius.
I think we've got them surrounded.
Didymus! Where's Didymus?
Fire!
I hit something, yes? No?
We've got to find Didymus.
Down this way.
Charge!
Tallyho!
Ambrosius, you coward.
Quick, in here.
How's Ludo gonna get in?
You in there, you're surrounded!
Surrounded?
Get out!
Ludo, hold the roof!
- Take that!
- Hungry? All right.
Ludo?
Ambrosius, unlock this door.
So had enough, have you?
Then throw down your weapons, and I'll see that you're well-treated.
Ludo!
Next time, surrender.
Good grief!
Steady, men.
Steady, men. Hold your ground.
Okay, I take it back.
Run for your lives!
I've had enough!
I'm going to bed.
Get out of my house!
Whoa, Nellie! Duck!
Missed!
Okay, come on.
Fire!
Hey, I just fired you.
This way.
Now we have you!
And now you don't.
Hey, no problem.
- Sir Didymus!
- Coming!
Hi-ho, Silver!
- Whoa, boy. Whoa, big fella.
- This way.
Steady, boy.
Yes. Up we go. Up, up.
Come on. Good boy.
Come on.
No.
Good boy. Come on.
- That's the only way he could've gone.
- Well then, come on.
- I have to face him alone.
- But why?
Because that's the way it's done.
Well, if that is the way it is done...
...then that is the way you must do it.
But should you need us...
Yes, should you need us...
I'll call.
Thank you, all of you.
Toby!
Toby.
Toby!
Give me the child.
Sarah, beware.
I have been generous up until now, and I can be cruel.
Generous?
- What have you done that's generous?
- Everything!
Everything that you wanted,
I have done.
You asked that the child be taken.
I took him.
You cowered before me.
I was frightening.
I have reordered time...
...I have turned the world upside down...
...and I have done it all for you.
I am exhausted from living up to your expectations of me.
Isn't that generous?
Through dangers untold and hardships unnumbered...
...I have fought my way here to the castle beyond the Goblin City.
For my will is as strong as yours...
...and my...
- Stop. Wait.
Look, Sarah.
Look what I'm offering you.
Your dreams.
And my kingdom as great.
I ask for so little.
Just let me rule you...
...and you can have everything that you want.
Kingdom as great.
Damn.
I can never remember that line.
Just fear me, love me, do as I say...
...and I will be your slave.
My kingdom as great.
My kingdom as great.
You have no power over me.
Toby.
Toby? Toby?
Toby?
Here you are.
I'd like Lancelot to belong to you now.
We're home.
Sarah, are you home?
Yeah. Yes, I'm home.
Goodbye, Sarah.
Remember, fair maiden...
...should you need us...
Yes, should you need us...
...for any reason at all...
I need you, Hoggle.
You do?
I don't know why, but...
...every now and again in my life...
...for no reason at all,
I need you.
All of you.
You do?
Well, why didn't you say so?
- Ludo!
- Sarah.
Ambrosius, good boy, good boy.
I say, does anyone here want to play a game of Scrabble?
- You remind me of the babe.
- What babe?
- The babe with the power.
- What power?
- The power of voodoo.
- Who do?
- You do.
- Do what?
Remind me of the babe.
King zed's wife.
Maax, high priest of the city of aruk.
The God ar has spoken.
The truth is known to us.
The truth is hungry!
The truth is horrible!
The prophecy dooms you.
I must know.
You will die at the hands of zed's unborn son.
Ha! Zed's unborn son will die!
The truth cannot be changed.
- He will die tonight!
- Rise for king zed!
I have been told you are planning a child sacrifice.
Ar demands the life of an unborn.
I will not allow the sacrifice of an innocent.
You are banished for life.
In aruk, no one will remember your name.
Go practice your heathen
religion in the outlands
with the barbarian juns.
The unborn child is yours!
Stand fast!
It must be cut from its mother.
Branded with the sign of ar, and sacrificed.
I could have you put to death.
Fanatic.
Take him away.
God ar.
It must be cut from its mother.
Branded with the sign of ar, and sacrificed.
Your unborn child is ours now!
Thirsty ar.
Holy ar.
Jealous ar.
Holy ar.
Come on.
Good.
Uh-huh!
Ohhh!
Good!
Your kapa.
Show me.
Tiis!
You old fool!
Father!
Father, run!
Run!
My leg!
Dar?
Run! Run!
Dar!
Ah, it'll be all right.
Tiis is dead.
What happened here today must never be known.
Never.
You have powers unlike anyone in the village.
To touch a beast up here...
The gods have put their mark on you.
And someday...
You'll find out why.
But till then, this mark... will be your guide.
Till then...
You're my beloved.
Now, you run ahead.
Tell the village, poor tiis. Go.
Todo! Todo!
Dar?
It's fixed.
Hyah!
Father.
Juns.
Dar, the gods have put their mark on you.
And someday you will find out why.
Till then, this mark will be your guide.
My sword and my kapa will be your trusted companions.
Protect emir, your home.
And if anything should happen to me, look for our enemies, the juns.
And you may search for your destiny in the valley of aruk.
Hey!
Come back here!
Whoa!
How about a little help?
Come on!
You two got me into this, now get me out.
Thanks.
Well!
I'm gonna name you kodo.
You'll get a name too.
Podo.
Kodo...
And podo.
My friends.
The juns.
We'll help him.
I have my eyes.
I have my cunning.
And now I have strength.
Ruh. Your name is ruh.
Don't move.
The beast is fierce.
But if we show no fear, we might escape.
You've just gotta show them who's in command.
You owe me your life.
But...
I'll accept this as payment.
Who are you?
I'm dar.
I'm no threat to you.
Who sent you?
I wasn't sent.
My village, emir, was destroyed by the jun horde.
I've sworn revenge...
And I'm following.
You? Alone?
Now... who are you?
I am kiri.
Slave to the priests of the temple of ar.
They whip you like...
A beast.
I am a slave!
What would you have me do?
Run away.
I'll protect you.
You don't understand.
I must go back.
If I don't, my family will be put to death.
Then let me go with you.
You would do well to forget me, and follow the juns.
With them, you can die like a man. Not so with the priests of ar.
Good-bye, dar.
Be careful.
Come.
What do you think?
Should we go after her?
Kiri.
Where'd she go? Huh?
Keep hidden.
Keeper of aruk,
i, your high priest,
demand your children...
Obey my command,
and ar will continue
to protect you!
May ar receive this child...
As a gift from your devoted servant.
Ar is not yet satisfied.
Hold back from ar what is his, and you will all perish by his hand!
Will you dare this fate?
No!
No, not her!
No!
Not her!
No!
Stop!
No!
No, don't harm my child!
No! Please!
Only the blood of this child...
Will make ar look upon you with compassion again.
Only the blood of this child...
Can make ar look upon you as his children again.
No!
Ar, I offer this humble sacrifice to you...
From your servant.
Ar! Ar! Ar!
You see?
Ar has spoken.
He wants your children.
I have something for you.
My little light is alive! Alive!
- Daddy!
- Oh, snatched from death by...
Master? Master?
I am sacco.
I will be forever in your debt.
What is mine, is yours.
Just ask me for anything.
There was a girl on the pyramid.
She's a friend.
Come. Inside.
At least let me offer you a meal.
The jun horde slaughtered most of the young men in aruk.
Zed, our king, is imprisoned in the pyramid.
His son disappeared.
The juns put their demon high priest, maax, in power, along with the fiendish witchwomen.
Now he breeds us...
For the blood of our children.
What about the girl?
Hmm. The slave girls.
They've been taken back to the temple...
To prepare them for their deaths.
I must find her.
Wait! The bridge is the only way out.
We are surrounded by that damnable tar sludge.
Which way did the jun horde go?
To the north.
But maax promises they shall return.
Then so shall I.
Thank you for the meal, my friend.
You'll see me again.
Ar wants this stranger.
Bring him to me, this master of the beasts.
This ring will lead you to him.
Ahead.
That's him!
See the brand?
That's him, zed's son.
Kill him! Kill him now.
Kill him!
Kill him now!
Face the animal on his own terms, you will find you are not so very strong.
Seth, look.
I'm indebted to you.
Ruh.
Is he yours?
We fight together sometimes.
I hope someday to be able to repay your kindness.
Life is a circle.
I'm sure we'll see each other again.
Friend!
Who are you?
I'm dar...
Of the emirites.
There are no more emirites.
Thanks to the juns,
I'm the last.
Juns.
Who are you, friend?
And where do you come from?
I am called Seth.
This is tal.
We are... pilgrims on our way to worship at the temple of ar.
I've never see a... pilgrim...
Who could use a staff the way you did.
But, sir, all pilgrims share a deep love of life.
Especially their own.
I, too, am on my way to worship at the temple of ar.
There is safety in numbers.
Perhaps we should travel together.
For three years since we fled aruk, we have been everywhere trying to raise an army...
To fight the juns.
Tal has now come of age.
It is now time for him to free his father...
The king.
I have just come from aruk.
Maax has total power.
It will be difficult to defeat him.
He will not stop me from freeing my father.
As long as zed lives, he remains a symbol of our strength.
With him to lead us, we'll crush maax!
How is it that you've come to travel with these animals?
They are my friends.
I'd always been told that my ability with animals was uncommon.
I see through their eyes.
They see through mine.
They know my thoughts.
I know theirs.
We depend on each other.
- Where'd you find these two?
- Ah, those are my thieves.
This is podo...
And kodo.
They steal just about anything they can get their hands on, as you can see...
Rings, trinkets, stones.
If you like that ring, keep it.
Nothing's too good for kodo and podo.
Seth, look.
Explain this.
I met a slave girl near a temple.
No! No, this comes from no slave girl.
I said a slave girl.
Podo must have stolen it.
That's why I'm following them...
To rescue her before she's...
Put to death.
We leave at dawn.
Who is this girl?
My cousin... kiri.
They've left the temple.
To where?
This way.
How are they dressed?
Five women in white, surrounded by priests in red.
You're right.
They're to be sacrificed.
- We must save her.
- But we're outnumbered.
Hmm.
My friends, the journey to aruk is a treacherous one.
Come. We have much planning to do.
Be quiet.
This beast is fierce.
Tie them.
Come on! Pull!
Pull!
We're not gonna make it.
Lighten the load!
Will you help us to free my father?
Send your cousin over to ask me.
What can I do to convince you to help us?
I'm very busy.
The rescue will take some time. I...
I think he's gonna help us.
I have a feeling he might.
You will come with us?
You're going to have a hard time getting rid of me.
We will meet in the taran valley in two nights' time.
Does he have any chance of finding rebels to help us?
If they're out there, he'll find them.
Oh, no, not you.
Why me? I'm a coward.
--Couldn't you just fly back and tell him you couldn't find me?
Oh, all right. I'm coming.
Sacco, where are we?
Quiet. We're about to enter the city.
So they both still live.
But they won't escape me this time.
We shall welcome them.
Come on. Hurry.
I shall wait for you on the north side.
No!
Come on.
Death guards.
This way.
Now I know why there were no guards out front.
This is the one.
That's how a death guard is made.
Extreme torture transforms
the man into a wild beast.
We have to steal those keys.
Stealing is best left up to thieves.
Here we go.
Watch. The jun priests
will encase his body
in deadly armor.
Now they will drain his blood and damage his brain...
With mysterious green liquid...
And leeches.
It'll kill anything it meets.
They have no fear whatsoever.
Follow me.
Come on.
- Why is she dressed like that?
- What about kodo and podo?
Don't worry about them.
They'll catch up. Come.
Around here.
She's a trov warrior, an ancient sect.
This pyramid used to be their home.
Trail?
Kiri will find my father.
He's there.
We need those keys.
It's open.
Ruh?
Ruh?
Uncle zed.
It's me.
It's kiri.
Yes, that is he, the one of whom prophecy spoke.
They'll be sacrificed come dawn.
Kill him!
You blinded my father!
I'll kill you!
Tal.
I'll send him to his death.
Dar.
- Son.
- Can you walk?
Yes.
Wait. Protect them.
Dar.
- This is our only way out of the city.
- Go. I'll cover your escape.
Please, you must come with us.
I can't leave without my little ones.
Go on. I'll catch up.
A little late.
Come on.
We can try to escape through the air shaft.
Down, now!
Down!
Yah! Hah!
Oh, no! The gate's closed.
We have to get out of here now.
Does the gate have a counterweight?
Yes.
You two are going to open that gate for us.
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Now we are dead.
Forget it.
Start for the gate.
They'll get it open.
Even though I cannot see,
I reject your pity.
Thirty-five warriors, strong and good, are more than enough to crush maax.
He and his monsters must die.
We will take aruk, and give them the death...
They so richly deserve.
No!
Taking back your city is not the answer.
If you succeed in killing maax and the priests, you will only bring down the wrath of the jun horde.
I've seen what they can do.
You need an army.
Who is this man?
He is a friend.
He is the beastmaster.
Please, you must listen to him.
He has already saved your life.
No, he is a freak.
A freak who speaks to animals.
But, father...
I need no coward by my side!
Go crawl down a hole with your animals.
My friends.
- Will you go with me now?
- I cannot leave.
Then I'll stay with you.
Even that's impossible now.
He's ordered you out.
No one will challenge him.
You will die.
It is my duty.
I... I have no choice.
Yes, we are outnumbered, but our blood is boiling for revenge.
But...
We will end our humiliation.
King zed...
Seth, my loyal warrior, we will attack the city before dawn.
Tal will go with me and be my eyes.
But tal...
Tal is man enough to take his rightful place with his father.
Seth, you will take 15 warriors and attack the main gate.
While you have their attention and are at the gate, we will attack.
We will storm the north wall.
Victory... will be ours.
Maax will pay for what he has done.
Lord zed, we must run.
Maax knows our plan.
Many years ago, maax killed my queen and took my unborn son.
Now he will pay.
We shall conquer him, and aruk will be mine again.
Maax shall die.
We are doomed.
Sacco!
Beastmaster, follow me home.
We need your help.
The attempt failed.
- Maax lives.
- What happened to kiri?
She was captured, as was zed and Seth and the boy.
They're to be sacrificed at sunset.
You must save them.
- Make way!
Your king zed...
Has denied the God ar!
Now he will die,
as will his kin.
Aah! Aah!
You are doomed.
The unborn has arrived.
Maax!
Aah!
Aah!
Zed, your unborn son...
Has returned to fulfill the prophecy.
My son?
I defy this false prophecy.
Zed, join your lost son.
Fight to the top!
Aah! Aah!
Aah!
Kodo!
Seth.
Juns.
Juns!
We must fight!
No, we must flee!
It's your decision now.
We will fight.
To the ropes!
Cover the moat!
Hook the horses up!
Pull!
Put your hearts into it!
Pull! Pull!
Pull for your freedom!
Pull!
Everybody to the moat!
Faster!
Faster! Cover the moat!
Everybody to the moat!
Start covering the moat!
Hurry, men! Hurry!
Make it look like dry ground.
Hide it. Cover it well.
In my village of emir, the tar was a rite of manhood and a test of strength.
If we're lucky, the juns will fail this test.
It almost worked.
Let's get out of here.
Raise the gate!
Beastmaster.
How is he?
He won't have the use of his left hand for a while, but he's well.
Then I shall be leaving. Oh.
For the new king.
It was you who was firstborn.
And it is you who should be king.
You trained tal well, and he will make a fine king.
Besides, he already has the strongest right hand...
That any leader of men could want.
Well... our new king
has risen from the dead.
He left this for you.
He's gone.
Between the years when the oceans drank Atlantis and the rise of the sons of Arius, there was an age undreamed of, when shining kingdoms lay spread across the world.
Hither came Conan, the Cimmerian, sword in hand.
It is I, his chronicler, who knows well his saga.
Now, let me tell you of the days of high adventure.
- I think we made the merchant angry.
- Are you surprised?
- But we didn't steal everything he had.
- We didn't have time.
- Why aren't they trying to kill us?
- Maybe they want to capture us, then torture us to death.
Conan, help!
- Do you know who I am?
- Taramis.
- Queen Taramis.
- Not my queen.
You have a queen?
But you are a Cimmerian.
The Cimmerians have no rulers.
You're a barbarian.
You live free in the world.
You owe allegiance to no one.
Is that not so?
It is and it always will be.
- What do you want?
- I need your help.
- No.
- No?
You don't know what I'd give you if you help me.
You have nothing that I want.
You were praying, Conan.
What were you praying for?
Look at the shrine.
See what you were praying for.
What is there, Conan?
Think.
Show me the desire in your deepest heart.
- Valeria!
- Where is this Valeria?
- With Crom.
- Your god.
She sits by the side of my god.
What I want, you cannot give me.
- Yes, I can.
- You can bring back the dead?
Do as I ask of you and I will.
Wake.
- And remember.
- Tell me what I must do.
Soon.
Conan! Look!
Doesn't that animal look familiar?
I think it does. I'm sorry about what happened the last time.
They love us!
We will drink to Dagoth, the dreaming god.
- What do you want me to do for you?
- To bring back the woman you love?
Yes.
It is written in the scrolls of Skelos that a woman child born with a certain mark must make a perilous journey.
It is her destiny.
My niece Jehnna has such a mark.
- I want you to take her on that journey.
- To where?
Jehnna will show you.
From the day she was born, she's been prepared for this.
There is a key she must find, a key only she can touch, as it was written in the scrolls of Skelos.
- Where is it?
In a castle.
- guarded?
- By a wizard called Toth-Amon.
- By a wizard?
- That frightens you.
You're afraid of magic.
And you will have to deal with it.
What good is a sword against sorcery?
- Then you're afraid to go?
- No. I will find a way.
- What does this key unlock?
- A treasure.
A jewelled horn. Only she can procure it.
Only she can lead you to it.
And when she has it, you'll bring her back to me.
Then you will have your reward.
We shall both have everything we want... through magic.
No!
It's all right. Don't be afraid.
- It's only a dream. It's only a dream.
- No, I saw...
A dream. Only a dream.
- Be still. Lie down.
I saw it.
I saw it again.
- No, you saw nothing.
A nightmare. lmaginings out of excitement. go back to sleep.
I saw it...
I saw it.
I did. I saw it.
Tomorrow you start your journey.
You'll need all your strength.
Your destiny is at hand.
Sleep.
Sleep.
All our destinies are at hand, even Conan's,
- though he doesn't yet know it.
- We don't need him, my queen.
I don't need the captain of the guard to steal a key. That is a task for a thief.
What I need you for is to see that this dear child is returned safely to the palace with both the treasure and her virginity intact.
I will protect them both.
You'd better, my friend, for she must be a virgin when she's returned to me, so she can be properly sacrificed.
One other thing, Bombaata.
It is not wise to have the king of thieves near the treasure.
So when the key is in my niece's hand,
I want your sword in Conan's heart.
Have the Elite guard follow. They will strike at the right moment to help you.
Conan must die.
Do you think he's handsome?
Very ugly.
No, not him. Conan.
Can't you judge for yourself?
But how can I?
How many times have I seen a man?
A real man.
All I've seen is you.
Meaning no insult to you, Bombaata.
Yes. He is handsome.
Conan, wait! We must go this way.
- Not yet.
- But you have to obey me.
Weren't you told?
There are rules to every game.
I believe you.
But there's magic in this game and I have to be able to fight it with magic.
Akiro!
Crom!
- What are they going to do?
- Have lunch.
Those savages should thank me, sparing them a terrible stomachache.
Why would they wanna eat someone as old and as sour as you?
They thought if they digested me, my magic would be in their blood.
At least they coulda washed you first.
I need you.
- I'm yours.
Tell me more about this key.
Oh, it's not an ordinary key. It's a jewel.
- A jewel?
- Yes. The Heart of Ahriman.
- Well, can it be worn?
- Only by me.
No one else dare touch it. lf there is anything here that you like, try not to take it.
I know when to steal and when not to.
Hit her. get her!
- What did she do?
- She came with bandits to raid us.
The others are dead. Now it's her turn, after we have our fun with her.
Don't kill her too soon!
- Save her!
- Thieves should be hanged.
Conan, there are six of them against her.
One, two, three... I think you're right.
And she's tied to the stake.
Do something!
Stop.
I think we made a friend.
- Wait here.
What do you want?
- To come with you.
- Be off!
- Let me speak to Conan.
I said be off.
Stop!
Leave.
I swear that if Conan will let me ride with him, I will give my life for him.
We shall see.
The castle of Toth-Amon. It holds the key.
Come bring her, Conan.
- We leave now.
In the morning.
- I'm the leader here.
- Lead in the morning.
It will be better. We must rest.
My thinking exactly.
Sleep. ln the morning you will touch the Heart of Ahriman.
The first to do so in a thousand years.
Look!
Jehnna... Jehnna!
Jehnna!
Akiro, where is she? ln there!
- Who took her?
- A giant bird.
A bird of smoke. lnto the boat!
Somebody should stay and watch the horses.
Malak!
I didn't mean me.
I'm rowing!
Too late, my friends.
But come... come anyway.
How do we get in?
Is there another entrance?
Under here is a way in.
- You mean under the water?
- You can stay here if you like.
Alone?
They need me.
Bombaata.
Wizard it open.
Fine magician you are. go back to juggling apples. get up! get him!
That's exactly what I would have done.
Exactly.
There are only two left, wizard, and you're behind one of them.
Which one?
- No! Not here!
- It's us!
Bombaata.
Bombaata!
Bombaata!
Bombaata!
I need you!
Bombaata!
- Bombaata...
- It's all right.
Crom!
Out! Out of here quick!
- Hurry, hurry!
- Quick! Out!
Bombaata!
All an illusion.
Help! Bombaata, help me!
Bombaata, where are you?
Put me down, do you hear me?
Put me down!
Look out, you fool!
Bombaata, stop!
- Why?
I thought you were going to hurt the girl.
This is one of the queen's guards.
- Why did they attack us?
- Not by her order.
Wait, wait. This is much better.
Akiro's own magic mixture.
Let me help you.
- What do you think you're doing?
- Covering your wound.
My wound is lower.
We don't want an infection to spread.
I'll spread your head open.
Is this what the world has come to?
You try to help somebody and what do you get instead of thanks?
Threats.
Now, yell if it hurts.
I suppose nothing hurts you.
Only pain.
After we return to Shadizar, what will you do?
I'll find my kingdom and a queen to sit beside me.
What kingdom?
The promise I was kingdomed.
No...
The kingdom I was promised.
- What queen?
- Valeria.
- Valeria...
- Valeria.
What is she like, this... Valeria?
Do you see this woman over there?
- Zula?
- Valeria is like her.
She doesn't look like her, but she has the same... spirit.
The same... The same...
Strength?
Strength. Strength.
And she's a warrior too?
A great warrior.
A great woman.
Could there ever be... anyone else but her?
Another queen?
Lot on your knife.
Not on your life.
Excuse me. I must get up now.
How do you feel?
Welcome.
You are welcome.
I didn't know women could be warriors.
All my tribe are warriors.
Well, it seems that men like women warriors.
Some.
Do you think that I could ever be one?
I could teach you how to use this.
Yes. Please.
Now, the power is in the wrists.
Oh, I see. Like this?
That's right. They've got to stay loose.
It takes practice and strength.
Wait!
Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Hold on. lf you're going to learn how to fight, then learn with a real weapon.
Not with a toothpick.
Here. I'll show you. Stand like this.
Yes. You do it. Try it.
And then swing it over your head.
I'll help you. Swing over your head. good.
Now you're ready to take on anybody.
How do you attract a man?
What I mean is... suppose you set your heart on somebody, what would you do to get him? grab him! And take him!
You'd grab him and... and take him?
Take him, like that!
- What did she mean?
- What did she say?
Well, she said that if she wanted a man, she'd reach out and take him. good idea.
But then what? I mean, you've got him.
What do you do with him?
That's easy. You see, you just...
You...
You see, in order for a man to really know a woman and for her to know him, they have to... they have to... to join.
Join? get together.
You see, he has to take his... his... and grab her by the...
There you are, joined.
I mean, how do you think flowers grow?
- Through this?
- Yes.
Is this the only way?
- Yes.
- We can't go around it?
I go where I feel myself led.
So I've noticed.
That way.
Shouldn't one of us go back and stand guard?
Bombaata.
Together.
Here, let me help.
Malak, go inside and see if there's a lock.
- You mean in there?
- go!
I found something. Let go. Easy.
''It is written in the scrolls of Skelos that the horn will be found by a woman child.''
''A virgin, who will have a mark upon her.''
''And when the horn is placed once more in the forehead of the dreaming god,
Dagoth will arise.''
''Then let men fear.''
''Death to the world.''
''The woman child will be sacrificed.''
- Stop her!
- Be silent!
Crom!
Death to the world.
Life for Valeria.
The girl's destiny isn't only to deliver the horn.
It's just writing on a wall.
She is to be killed. Sacrificed.
We shall see, destiny or not.
Everybody out!
Out!
Wait! It's worth a fortune!
- We come in peace.
- Then let us go in peace.
Let the girl come forward.
We've been waiting for her all our lives.
We are the keepers of the horn.
It belongs to us.
No longer.
- Who are you?
- Conan.
I have heard of you.
Do you know the legend written on the wall of the crypt?
From the day of my birth.
Then you know what will happen if the horn is placed back in the forehead of Dagoth.
The god will live again.
And we who give him life will stand by his right hand and rule the world with him.
You will die in the great evil that will come from his rebirth!
- We will control him.
- No one is able to control him!
His power and his evil are too great! give us the girl or we'll take her!
Enough talk!
Back to the crypt!
Bombaata, get out!
Out! Let's get out of here!
Behind the dragon there's a tunnel.
It could be our only way out.
The jewel. Take the jewel.
Hurry, hurry.
That way.
Malak! Malak, come on!
Malak!
It's the leader. He's a wizard.
- He's forcing the mouth open.
- Well, stop him. Kill him or something.
- My dagger is gone. You kill him.
- Not me. It's bad luck to kill a wizard.
Wait. There is a better way to take care of a wizard.
Well done, Akiro. lnto the tunnel.
Don't stop. Hurry! Hurry!
Run! Run!
- Where are the others?
- They're coming. Don't worry. go!
- They've gone.
- Taken their horses.
Or been captured. Let's flee.
Wait.
Bombaata took her.
Taramis planned it from the beginning.
We get the horn, her guards will kill us, and Bombaata takes the girl and the horn back to her.
- And her promise to you?
- A lie.
- Where are we going?
- To Shadizar.
- What for?
- To stop Jehnna's sacrifice.
But it's her destiny. It can't be stopped.
- You don't have to come.
I will.
I will.
I won't!
I mean, what's in it for us?
What are we? Some charitable institution? We're thieves! go! I won't help!
Hey!
Hey, wait for me!
You know you can't do without me!
Wait, Conan, wait!
Do you have the treasure?
Bring it to me.
Reserves to guard the palace.
There must be hundreds of them around it. We can't get in there.
Well, you can't say we didn't try.
- The front gate can't be the only way in.
- Oh, it isn't...
Malak?
At the bottom, behind the waterfall, there's an entrance.
It used to be an exit. My cousin's sister's brother dug his way out there, when he was a prisoner in Shadizar.
Today is your birthday.
All of Shadizar is celebrating.
Drink.
To life. To Dagoth.
To Dagoth.
Oh, Dagoth, god of gods.
My cousin's sister's brother never said anything about bars.
How do we get back up?
The bars were put up after your sister's brother's cousin escaped!
Cousin's sister's brother. How many times do I have to tell you that?
- You said your sister's brother's cousin!
- Who cares who it is?
What difference does it make?
At the first sign of life in our god, the girl must be sacrificed.
Or, as the scrolls of Skelos say, a catastrophe will befall us.
Oh, Dagoth, god of gods.
Power above all power.
Kill her!
Save the girl!
Kill her! Kill her! She must be sacrificed.
No! get back!
Down the steps!
No!
Run!
His horn is his life! Tear out the horn!
Zula.
I need a captain of the guards.
I see no reason why a woman wouldn't do as well as a man.
- You.
- Me?
Come here.
I understand that every king or queen must have a fool.
- Do I qualify?
- More than qualify.
Will the world's greatest wizard come forward, please?
At your service.
One cannot rule without wisdom.
- Let me instruct you in the fine art of...
- Later.
Rule Shadizar with me.
I will have my own kingdom, my own queen.
So it was that Conan mourned his lost Valeria.
At length, he sought adventure in distant lands and trod the jewelled thrones of the earth beneath his sandalled feet, until at last he found his own Kingdom and wore his crown upon a troubled brow.

Hear you now...
...a story of good against evil.
An epoch that has its beginning at an ending...
...and ends at a beginning.
Listen, as we speak of the fall of a lord of darkness...
...and the return of a king of light.
Concern yourselves with armies and wizards...
...phantoms and emperors...
...cloud-capped towers and bloodied fields of horrendous carnage.
Consider no less...
...than the cataclysmic transformation...
...of that ancient world of wonder and magic...
...to the world we know now, of Man.
What mighty lord, you may ask, is hero enough...
...to evoke such cosmic metamorphosis?
Why, no lord at all, but the littlest of fellows...
...Frodo the Hobbit...
...and his faithful squire, Samwise.
Who, beginning at the ending, now approach Rivendell...
...the Elvish home of Elrond...
...there to help celebrate the 129th birthday...
...of Frodo's aged kin...
...Bilbo Baggins, renowned tormentor of dragons.
Bless my soul!
You're a match for Smaug himself.
All of us, Frodo and Samwise...
...their Hobbit companions,
Merry and Pippin...
...Elrond the Elf-Lord, and I, Gandalf...
...wished Bilbo only the best.
But as we celebrated far into the Elvish night...
...we found it difficult to keep our aging guest of honor awake.
Nay, Pippin. Not till Bilbo has cut it.
Blast. What a time to fall asleep.
Who's asleep?
Just resting my eyes...
...and remembering.
There And Back Again...
...and what happened after.
Remembering, sir?
So many things.
Old Smaug...
...dear Thorin...
...that terrible Gollum chap...
...the Ring of Invisibility.
What's become of my ring?
That ring I gave you and you took away.
Yes.
I've lost it, Bilbo dear.
I got rid of it, you know.
Pity. I should have liked to see it again.
But...
...now, how silly of me.
That's what you went for, wasn't it?
To get rid of it.
But why destroy a thing of such wondrous magic?
It was an evil thing, sir.
Nay!
Without its powers...
...I could never have faced the worm, Smaug.
You unwittingly used its evil forces for good, dear Uncle.
Your innocence protected you.
But had you continued to wear it...
...instead of keeping it above your mantle as a trophy...
...its ever-growing malignancy would have consumed you...
...as it almost consumed Samwise and me and the whole of Middle-earth.
But this is all so confusing.
So confusing.
- Will he never cut the cake?
- Patience, Merry.
Me for a good smoke, while we wait.
- What say, master?
- Good notion, Sam.
Bless my soul!
You are missing a finger!
You not only lost my ring...
...you lost the finger on which it rode?
Frodo, you must explain.
We have brought with us someone...
...who has written a ballad about the adventures of Frodo:
The Minstrel of Gondor.
"Frodo of the nine fingers
"And the Ring of Doom"
It has its beginnings two ages past...
...when Bilbo set forth to reclaim the Dwarves' gold...
...from the dragon, Smaug.
While on his quest,
Bilbo stumbled into a deep, dank cave.
This part I remember.
"When Bilbo found that shiny ring
"In Gollum's cave of gloom
"He never thought
"That it would turn into a ring of doom
"The dragon Smaug
The spiders too
"The Goblins, the Elven-king
"They came to know the power
"Of the Hobbit and his ring
"Frodo of the nine fingers
"And the Ring of Doom
"It started with a Hobbit
"In Gollum's cave of gloom
"The power of the Ring, it grew
"And Gandalf sat in thought
"He knew that it must be destroyed
"In fires where it was wrought
"For if in evil hands it fell
"The Earth would know its end
"No force of arms would win the day
"No army could contend"
For evil flourished everywhere...
...and lay on the land like a festering malignancy.
There was one hope, though:
In a distant land, the noble Aragorn...
...heir to the empty throne of Gondor...
...awaited with a small band to return and become king.
But he could not triumph until the Ring was destroyed.
So went the prophecy.
"Frodo of the nine fingers
"And the Ring of Doom
"Accepted a heavy burden
"For the fires to consume"
Frodo and his gallant companion, Samwise...
...had many brave adventures...
...until finally they reached the rocky border of Mordor...
...domain of the Black Lord, Sauron.
There, Frodo was captured and imprisoned in the Tower of Cirith Ungol.
Samwise vowed to enter the Orc-infested tower alone...
...to save him.
The Ring of Doom was missing...
...from 'round Frodo's neck!
"Frodo of the nine fingers
"And the Ring of Doom
"Why does he have nine fingers?
"Where is the Ring of Doom?"
One tiny Hobbit against all the evil the world could muster.
A sane being would have given up.
But Samwise burned with a magnificent madness...
...a glowing obsession to surmount every obstacle...
...to find Frodo, destroy the Ring, and cleanse Middle-earth...
...of its festering malignancy.
He knew he would try again, fail perhaps and try once more...
...a thousand, thousand times, if need be.
But he would not give up the quest.
You cannot die, Master Frodo!
I'll get to you somehow!
You. I can feel you throbbing with excitement!
You know the gates to the land of Mordor and your dark lord, Sauron.
Now I must bear your loathsome weight.
But I do it for he who lies in that accursed tower...
...Cirith Ungol:
My sweet master, Frodo.
And, 'tis Sting...
...Master Frodo's sword.
And his hero's cloak!
Lost 'em with the Ring while doing battle, he did.
They're safe with me till I find you again, master!
He can't hear.
Half dead, behind walls of stone.
Serve me, Sting, till I can return you.
Here now.
What's this?
Dank and foul-smelling...
...but it may be a way in.
I've got through!
So I've finally crossed into Mordor.
Orcs in the tower!
Old Bilbo called them Goblins.
But whatever the name,
I loathe the vile creatures.
Fighting among themselves?
I could get in!
They wouldn't notice me!
The Ring holds me back?
True.
Once the Orcs saw me...
...they'd forget their own arguments for the head of an enemy!
Useless to face such odds.
Don't take any chances.
Destroy the thing yourself.
I do it for you, Frodo!
I must be ring bearer now!
"The bearer of the Ring
"The wearer of the Ring
"Stands on the very brink of fate
"Staring into eyes of darkness and despair
"That rise and shrink with hate"
I can feel you change as we draw near the great furnaces...
...where in the depths of time, you were shaped and formed.
Mount Doom!
I could claim you, Ring!
I would be Samwise the Strong!
"The bearer of the Ring
"The wearer of the Ring
"He hears a voice compelling him
"Filling him with thoughts
That echo in his mind
"It should be telling him
"Beware the power is a power never known
"Beware the power that was simple
"Now has grown
"Beware, bearer of the Ring
"The final power has yet to be shown
"The bearer of the Ring
"The wearer of the Ring
"Through forces tempting to resist
"Must recall the quest
"To end this darkest age
"That mortal death has kissed
"The bearer of the Ring
"The wearer of the Ring
"Beware who wears the Ring"
Hail Samwise the Strong!
Hail the Conqueror!
Hail the War-King!
Hero of the Age!
To the Dark Tower!
To Barad-dur!
I claim thee, Barad-dur!
You are Sauron's no more!
Hail Samwise the Strong!
The sun shines for thee alone!
And now I claim all of the Vale of Gorgoroth!
Now let this foul desolation...
...this cursed plateau of the Dark Lord, Sauron...
...this Orc-infested, desert of nameless horrors...
...let it blossom forth, and live!
Let it live for Samwise the Strong!
Samwise the Strong!
Behold!
The gardens of my delight!
So I shall transform the world!
All could be mine...
...if I but claim thee, Ring!
No!
What brought me back?
Plain Hobbit sense.
I know in my heart I'm not enough to bear such a burden.
One small garden of a free gardener...
...is all my need and due.
My own hands to use...
...not the hands of others to command.
No, such a quest is not for me.
Frodo lives.
And only he knows how to destroy the Ring...
...in the Cracks of Doom.
Only he can find the fire.
Dear Master Frodo.
I will find you.
Somehow.
An ancient world of towered fortress cities.
Cirith Ungol...
...guarding the entrance to the lands of Mordor.
Barad-dur, palace of the Dark Lord, Sauron.
And now, look you to yet another.
Minas-Tirith, chief city of Gondor...
...last bastion of hope for the powers of light and good.
From the battlement atop the citadel, like a mariner in a mountainous ship...
...one could look sheer down upon the gate 700 feet below.
And still this was not the top.
Behold! The White Tower.
At the top, the banner of the stewards who governed the city...
...its silken arms embracing a domain more fitting Gwaihir...
...Lord of the Eagles than those whose emblem it bore.
All this, Minas-Tirith was.
But now, under siege, the sparkling gem of Gondor...
...had become dull and flawed with the hell of war.
The once-lush fields of Pelennor, now a wasted battleground...
...upon which Sauron's forces of evil celebrated their victories.
Far superior in number to the battle-ravaged Gondor forces...
...they mounted their monster oliphaunts...
...to ride in the rocking, armored towers, to their almost certain victory.
And in the heavens, where no living thing dare now venture...
...Sauron's phantom lieutenants, the Nazgul, astride their devil steeds...
...scream battle cries of vile encouragement.
High in the White Tower, Lord Denethor,
Chief Steward of Gondor...
...his mind broken as his city crumbled about him...
...had succumbed to an eerie fire of the brain...
...and, in his madness, ordered his own execution.
- You must stop him!
- His word is law!
I'll find Gandalf!
The Hobbit, Pippin, who had proved a most valuable assistant for me...
...rushed to the battlement.
Where I, Gandalf...
...and the Gondor generals searched the distance in vain...
...for a sign of our rescuers.
For we awaited Theoden...
...a valuable ally, lord of the friendly nation of Rohan...
...for whom we had dispatched
Pippin's Hobbit friend, little Merry...
...to inform him of our perilous condition and to beseech his aid.
For we wondered, would he and his armies come to our rescue?
Forward! To Minas-Tirith!
Forward!
For only Theoden could save our city...
...and make it safe for the return of Aragorn.
But we feared he would come too late.
- What? Denethor?
- He's gone loony, I tell you!
Come quickly.
You cannot do this!
Soon all shall be burned.
The West has failed.
It shall go up in a great fire...
...and all shall be ended.
Ash and smoke blown away on the wind.
All shall not be ended.
Theoden's forces are on their way!
Pride and despair!
Pride and despair!
Didst thou think the eyes of the White Tower were blind?
I have looked inside my palantir.
- What is that?
- Palantir. The stuff of wizards.
A crystal ball to see the future.
I have seen more than thou knowest, gray fool.
Thy hope is but ignorance.
Even with the forces of Theoden, there is no hope.
Go forth and fight!
Vanity!
For a little space you may triumph on the field...
...for a day.
But against the dark power...
...that now rises, there is no victory.
To this dying city, only the first fingers of its hand...
...have yet been stretched.
All the East is moving!
And even now, the wind of thy hope cheats thee...
...and wafts up an enemy fleet with black sails.
Up the Great River, Anduin they come, even now.
The river which leads to the edge...
...of the Pelennor Fields.
A black fleet? A devil's armada?
- Do those palantir things ever lie?
- Never!
The West has failed!
It is time for all to depart this life...
...who would not be slaves!
Servants, come hither!
So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.
And so pass also the days of Gondor.
For good or evil they have ended.
You must take charge, Gandalf.
You must lead our forces now...
...until Aragorn returns to claim the throne of Gondor.
If he returns.
Gandalf, you...
I saw the vision in the palantir.
A dark fleet.
- Is there no hope?
- None.
Unless the Ring be destroyed.
But alas, it is lost with its bearer, Frodo.
All is gone.
I, Gandalf was without hope.
For I did not know that at that very moment...
...at that other towered fortress...
...the future of all good in the world...
...rested upon the wits and the tiny shoulders...
...of poor little Samwise...
...who, still undetected by the Orcs within...
...approached the gates of the Tower of Cirith Ungol.
But to get through those gates...
...he would have to pass the Two Watchers.
Though carved from huge blocks of solid stone...
...some dreadful spirit of evil vigilance abode in them...
...and they were aware.
My imagination's running away with me.
They're made of stone.
What harm can they do?
Don't get too cocky, Samwise.
Orcs aren't made of stone, and they have ears.
Though where the blazes are they?
I thought the tower was full of them.
But they give me the shivers.
Forget about them.
Get past as quick as I can!
Bless my soul.
Like some invisible gate.
That's how the Watchers keep guard.
Blast!
How do I get through, or climb over, or under something I can't see?
How?
Ouch!
Something's burning me.
What's this? A phial?
And what magic is in it to make it glow so?
They're opening up!
Thank you, old boys.
It was bad manners you showed me before.
Handy, this thing.
An alarm! That's done it.
I'm ready for you.
Tell your captains that a great Elf warrior has called...
...with his Elf blade!
They're all dead.
Why?
The tower was crawling with them just a few hours ago.
Looks like they were fighting among themselves.
But what for?
There's a lot less of you left to attack Minas-Tirith!
Goodbye and good riddance!
The whole tower climbs backwards-like.
I'll follow these lights.
This must be the entrance to the top tier.
Frodo can't be far away.
An Orc! They're not all dead!
Kill him! Bone him! Boil him!
There's a sweet one for you!
Split him in two!
Can't let him have the Ring!
No!
What the blazes made him do that?
Come back here!
No!
The great Elf warrior is loose! Stop.
Stop, or I'll skin you alive!
Mercy!
I'll think about it!
I have some questions, filthy one.
Yes? I'll tell you anything.
The Hobbit, Frodo, is he still alive?
If anything still lives here, he does.
What happened here?
Why all this carnage?
Our captains made battle and ordered us to fight also.
What was in contest?
The Hobbit's pretty coat...
...when he reveals its hiding place.
You killed each other for that blasted cloak?
Well, I have it! Not Frodo.
You?
You're just a Hobbit.
- Give me the coat.
- Get back!
This must be the top.
Anything above?
Yes.
There is something!
Frodo!
Stop that, you pig!
Frodo.
Dear master. Frodo.
You live.
You live!
- Am I still dreaming?
- No dream, master.
It's real. I've come.
Sam. Dear Sam.
I feel like a child at rest.
When night fears are driven away.
By some loved voice.
Come, Mr. Frodo.
I still must get you out of this place.
Please, dear master, wake up.
They hovered over me.
Gloating, fingering their knives.
The whips, their claws, their eyes...
Don't think about it.
Let me help you to your feet.
Oh, dear. The quest.
The quest has failed.
Failed? No, sir.
Yes. The Ring is gone, dear Sam.
Even if we could get out of here, we can't escape.
For evil is everywhere.
And only Elves can escape Middle-earth.
They board the white ships at the Gray Havens...
...and sail off to the lands beyond.
Don't even think of passing on!
The quest has not failed, master!
You don't understand.
The Orcs took everything!
Not everything. Look.
You've got it? You've got it here?
You must have lost it in the struggle.
I found it.
Samwise, you are a marvel!
I'll keep it 'round my neck...
...for it's too heavy for you to bear in your condition.
Give it to me at once! You can't have it!
All right, Mr. Frodo. Here it is.
"Beware the power is a power never known
"Beware the power that was simple now has grown
"Beware"
You filthy, slimy thief!
- I have the power now.
- Master, no.
Don't say such things. Please don't.
It's the Ring.
Sam. What have I said?
What have I done? Forgive me.
I'd forgotten its malevolent trickery.
I'm fine now. Fine. Sam, forgive me.
I must carry the burden to the end.
It can't be altered.
You can't come between...
...me and this doom.
As you wish, master.
I also have found Sting.
Might I keep it with me a little longer?
I have the strength to use it.
And you, with your wound and all...
Yes, of course, dear Sam.
And your cloak which I wear.
In a pocket I found this.
It has powers.
It got me past the Watchers. What is it?
The Phial of Galadriel! I can say no more.
If I betray the trust and give the secret, its powers will die.
- I understand.
- But now we must get out of here quickly.
I know the chain mail's heavy for you.
But we may need it.
And I can't leave anything behind, so I'll wear the Orc garb over my own.
Don't we make a fine, matching pair.
Now, off to Mount Doom.
Hope you've made inquiries about inns along the road?
- Inns, master?
- For food and drink.
Only the best for two fine Orcs.
There's nothing, master, and you know it well.
Save for the few crumbs of cake and drops of water left in my pack.
Courage, Sam. That's enough to start on.
The food we might manage, but the water's going to be bad business.
We'll make it.
But we'd best start, or a whole lake of it won't do us any good!
No, I'm all right. It's the mail.
I'll get used to it. Come.
I'm going to faint, Sam.
I don't know what's come over me.
It's that invisible gate.
There's some devilry there.
But I got through once.
Now for it!
It's still there!
This is not working.
They were expecting it!
Their will is strong.
It needs helping.
We've broken the Watchers' will!
We've still a chance, Samwise.
There's still a chance to destroy the Ring.
- A Black Rider. The Nazgul.
- Run, Mr. Frodo.
Not that way! There's a drop, follow me.
Careful, Mr. Frodo.
I can't. Not another step.
We must keep going, master.
The Nazgul is in charge of the Tower now!
A Black Rider is not so easy to fool as the Orcs.
Just give me a moment.
Begging your pardon, sir, but there's no time.
Listen as the foul flying demon...
...gives alarm to the whole Vale of Gorgoroth!
He's rallying the dark forces to defend the Tower.
Soon they'll be upon us.
We've got to get away and hide!
Yes, of course, dear Sam.
Listen.
We'd best get across the bridge, while we've still time.
If Sauron himself was to offer me a glass of water, I'd shake his hand.
Don't say such things.
It only makes it worse.
Sam.
A spot of dizziness there. I'm sorry.
'Tis a long time, Mr. Frodo, since I had a proper sleep.
Come, Sam, we shall support each other.
It's no good, Sam.
I can't manage the weight of this mail shirt.
It's of no use anyway.
We shall never get through by fighting.
We may have some to do.
We won't take on armies.
Who knows what's down here in this canyon...
...slithering behind the rocks?
No, Sam, it must go.
What about that Gollum creature, for instance?
The Gollum isn't dead, and he's still after that ring!
I'd hate to think of you with naught but a bit of leather...
...between you and a stab in the dark.
This hellish Mordor.
First it sears you, then it freezes you.
Mr. Frodo...
...maybe we could rest just a little.
My eyes are fair closing by themselves.
Not here.
I didn't want to say anything...
...but there's a black rider, a Nazgul, over us.
I can feel it. We must keep moving.
Only a little more to climb out of the canyon.
Then we'll take a look...
...and see what the Vale of Gorgoroth holds for us.
I told you, you'd see it, Mr. Frodo.
Just look at it.
God help us.
Behold Gorgoroth!
I don't like the looks of things at all.
Pretty hopeless, I call it.
Yes. And these dark armies are not only of Orcs.
There are Men, too!
We just can't cross all that open country crawling with enemies.
Still, Sam, we shall have to try.
It's no worse than I expected.
I never hoped to get across...
...but I've got to do the best I can.
I think we can make it to the next boulder, master.
No one is about.
Blasted moonlight.
Traveling by night's almost as bad as by day.
Come now, sir. I'll help.
Got to rest.
If you please, sir. Me too.
Just for a few minutes.

Mr. Frodo.
- What is it?
- Now we've gone and done it.
Slept through till daylight.
With only this fool rock between us and them armies.
Look out.
What have we here? Two deserters?
Up with you! Get in line!
We're in luck.
- He thinks we're Orcs.
- Luck?
Good sir, we're gonna be marching with the whole blinking army...
...back to Cirith Ungol where we started from!
Come on, you slugs!
"Where's there's a whip
"We don't wanna go to war today
"But the Lord of the Lash says,
'Nay, nay, nay'
"We're gonna march all day
"Where there's a whip, there's a way"
I can't continue.
I'd rather be singing a good old Hobbit song myself.
At least they gave us provisions for our packs.
But Orc food is enough to turn a rodent sick.
Samwise, we have got to break ranks.
Not while old whipper there is watching.
Don't worry, master.
The opportunity will come.
Halt.
What do you mean, "halt"?
I have a battalion of Men to move across your road.
Well I've got a battalion of Orcs to move across yours.
You wait!
Men come before Orcs. Get back.
I think this is it! You stay right here, sir.
You going to stand for that, sir?
Get back in line!
You mean you're going to let a pack of filthy Man-creatures go before us?
And you call yourself an Orc?
You're right.
Kill them, bone them, cut them to bits!
Smash them, bash them!
Skin them alive!
Not an inch.
Not an inch further can I move.
Come, Mr. Frodo.
One more crawl and then you can lie still.
A bit further.
This way, sir.
No use. Going to die. Can't see a thing.
Mr. Frodo.
Don't die, Mr. Frodo.
You can't die. Please, master.
If any power of good can hear us in this accursed land...
...give us help.
Help us.
Power of good?
Indeed, was there none left in all Middle-earth...
...with strength to aid our dying cause?
At that moment, the forces of darkness made ready to break the main gate...
...with a mighty battering ram which they had named Grond.
Long had it been forging in the dark smithies of Mordor...
...and on it spells of ruin lay.
- The gate will never stand up to that thing!
- Like the arm of the devil himself!
When the gates break
I shall be there to greet it!
Have my steed, Shadowfax, made ready!
- Farewell, Pippin.
- I go with you, sir.
Then we leave this life together.
Come, little one.
On, Shadowfax!
The Lord of the Nazgul...
...Sauron's second-in-command.
A creature of the super-natural...
...and so no living Man could hinder him...
...nor bring him harm in any way.
He was invulnerable!
You cannot enter here!
Go back to the abyss prepared for you!
Go back! Fall to the nothingness that awaits you and your master. Go!
Old fool!
This is my hour.
Do you not know Death when you see it?
Die now and curse in vain!
And, as from some courtyard of the city, a cock crowed...
...recking nothing of wizardry or war...
...welcoming only the morning...
...that in the sky far above the shadows of death...
...was coming with the dawn.
For as if in answer there came from far away, another note.
Horns! Horns! Horns!
Over the fields of Pelennor, they echoed from the distance.
Great horns in the north, wildly blowing.
Theoden and the rescuing arms of Rohan had come at last.
Ride now.
Ride now, to Gondor.
Victory was slipping from the grasp of evil...
...even as he stretched out his hand to seize it.
And the strength of goodness began to be felt once more...
...throughout the lands.
Had a prayer been answered?
Water. Give me water.
Master! Thank heaven!
Here, not too much now.
Not all at once.
He's weakening.
I feel it. Sauron is weakening.
But he is still in command.
His arm is long, and it wields great power.
No, master. You must rest.
I must still destroy the Ring.
I've more of a chance now...
...but there's still such a long way to go.
That's tomorrow, Mr. Frodo, tomorrow.
And as the battle raged anew on the fields of Pelennor...
...the carnage continuing endlessly through the days and nights...
...the real victory still lay in the hands of Frodo and Samwise...
...and the terrible weight they bore closer and closer...
...to the destruction, which was our only hope.
And finally, almost dead...
...without fully realizing they had reached the roots...
...of the accursed Mount Doom.
Come, Sam. Dear Sam.
For the rest of the way we shall crawl.
And so foot by foot...
...like small gray insects...
...they crept up the slope...
...ever closer to that which lay inside the mountain...
...the fire, and the Cracks of Doom.
"Doom
"The Cracks of Doom
"The chambers of fire
"The fires of doom"
Who causes the minutes to fall dead...
...adding up to no passing hour...
...bringing no change from day to night...
...as the unseen sun fails to filter into the ever-present shadows?
Who is this dark lord who turns starless nights into sunless days?
How does his piercing eye see through the ever-present darkness?
Seeing all and nothing.
The Restless Eye, in his dark tower...
...wearing a veil of protective shadow he has woven from fear.
And yet he fears, too.
In the security of his protective realm...
...he fears the winds of the world are turning against him.
Tearing aside his veils and troubling him...
...with tidings of bold spies that have passed through his fences.
"Doom
"The Cracks of Doom
"The chambers of fire
"The fires of doom"
- Did you see when the clouds parted?
- Yes.
He's spotted us!
It's all up, or will soon be.
This is the end of ends!
Still have a chance.
Bless you, sir, for your bravery!
Give me the strength.
I ask you:
Give me the strength to try once more.
Wicked master.
- God help us.
- Gollum.
Wicked master cheats us.
He mustn't go that way!
He mustn't hurt Precious.
Away, you scum.
What do you want of us?
Give it to Gollum, yes, give it to us!
Give it to us!
My Precious, my ring.
Soon it will be mine...
...all mine!
Precious, my Precious.
Precious.
Precious is mine.
You foul, reeking scum!
I'll kill you!
I can't strike! I may hit Mr. Frodo.
Let me get hold of the Ring.
"The bearer of the Ring
"The wearer of the Ring
"Stands on the very brink of fate
"Staring into eyes of darkness and despair
"That rise and shrink with hate"
Be gone and trouble me no more!
If you touch me ever again...
...you shall be cast, yourself, into the Fire of Doom.
Look out! He'll spring again.
Quick, master, no time to lose.
Go on! I'll deal with him!
Now I can deal with you!
Don't kill us. Don't hurt us.
Let us live, please.
Let us live, just a little longer.
Live.
Lost.
We're lost!
And when Precious goes...
...we'll die, yes.
All of us die into the dust.
How can I kill such a pitiful and cringing abomination?
I have come to know the strain of bearing the Ring for even a little while.
But this miserable creature enslaved to it for years...
Curse you, you stinking thing!
Be off! I don't trust you, not as far as I could kick you.
But be off or I shall hurt you with nasty cruel steel. Yes!
Now to find Mr. Frodo again.
And here it is. Sammath Naur!
Doorway to the gut of the mountain, and to hell itself, for all I know.
Dark, hot, reeking.
Frodo! Master!
There's no choice.
I have to go in.
And at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields the tide had turned...
...with the arrival of Theoden and the armies of Rohan.
- Hail proud Merry!
- Hail Pippin.
Bless you for a sure eye, old friend.
How good to see you!
Bless you for bringing Theoden and his army.
You've won the day for us!
In the midst of Theoden's glory, his golden shield was dimmed.
The new morning was blotted from the sky. And the dark fell upon him.
Fear no darkness, Snowmane.
No, Snowmane!
And the Dark Force had claimed our savior, Lord of Rohan.
Lord Theoden! Nay.
Oh, my dear master. Oh, the horror.
No, my friend. He is gone!
You can do nothing.
Hear me, O Darkness!
I will avenge my lord!
And what event...
...at just that moment caused evil to enlist such power?
Nothing here, surely.
But in the bowels of Mount Doom...
Master! Mr. Frodo.
Master, where are you?
Behold! The Crack of Doom!
- Master.
- Hold. Get back!
Master, it is me, Samwise!
And if that be the Crack of Doom...
...at last do what you've come all this distance to do!
Now!
I have come. But I do not choose to do now what I have come to do!
"The bearer of the Ring
The wearer of the Ring
"He hears a voice compelling him
"Filling him with thoughts that echo in his mind
"It should be telling him"
No, Mr. Frodo.
Don't let the Ring claim you!
"Beware the power is a power never known
"Beware the power that was simple now has grown
"Beware, oh wearer of the Ring
"The final power has yet to be shown"
Get back! I am not the Ring's!
The Ring is mine. Look!
Master!
No!
Please!
He had come again, bringing ruin...
...turning hope to despair, and victory to death.
Be gone, foul Dwimmerlaik,
Lord of Carrion.
Leave the dead in peace!
Come not between the Nazgul and his prey!
Or he will slay thee in turn.
Do what you will. I will hinder it, if I may!
Hinder me? Thou fool.
Dost thou not know the prophecy?
"No living man may hinder me."
But no living man am I!
You look upon a woman. Eowyn am I.
You stand between me and my lord and kin.
Be gone for living or dark undead
I will smite you if you touch him!
A woman? Eowyn?
'Tis Lord Theoden's niece!
She wanted to ride with us, but he forbade.
She disguised as a knight and she came hither!
A foul, putrid wind!
How does she bear the stench of it?
Strong she is, and brave.
I must to her aid!
No!
It's empty!
Uncle, I have avenged thee!
Theoden was borne from the field with honor.
And we wondered if, when our own lord,
King Aragorn, returned...
...would his fate be the same?
With the death of the Nazgul lord,
Sauron's forces lost heart...
...and began a retreat of abysmal disarray.
And then, as if our triumph were but a child's toy...
...a game with which Sauron was playing and taunting us...
...the tide of battle suddenly changed.
For from the wretched forces of evil, a new cry of hope went up.
The Black Fleet!
That which I dreaded had happened.
For if enemy-laden ships had come from this direction...
...it meant that the black forces had already conquered Ethir and Lebennin...
...lands we had thought safely ours.
The tide had turned still one more time...
...and this time, against us!
But behold!
As the flagship's standard broke the wind...
...it displayed the sign no lord had borne for years...
...and which only one lord could bear:
Aragon! He who would be our king...
...had returned!
And the hosts of Mordor were seized with bewilderment...
...and they fled.
That night we held council.
While Aragorn had the enemy on the run...
...he decided to pursue them into Mordor...
...across the Gorgoroth Plateau...
...and to the bastion of Sauron himself, the Dark Tower of Barad-dur.
The shortest way would be through the pass at Cirith Ungol.
But that is narrow and dangerous to move an army through.
And so he decided to march along the mountains, north...
...and then west...
...to the haunted pass of Cirith Gorgor...
...and the untold legions of the Black Lord.
Why so glum, Wizard?
Does the mere thought of Sauron's vast forces overwhelm your spirit?
This war is without final hope.
Victory cannot be achieved by force of arms...
...whether you sit here to endure siege after siege...
...or march out to be overwhelmed.
You have only a choice of evils!
Then, if the choice be mine...
...I choose to march!
And for days and nights march we did.
But my spirit was leaden.
"Win the battle, lose the war
"Choice of evils lie before your feet
"Retreat, retreat, retreat"
And finally, the pass.
Guarded by The Towers of the Teeth.
And inside, the Orcs made song to match my spirit.
"If you win then you will lose
"Choice of evils yours to choose
"Retreat, retreat, retreat
"You are standing in the eye of the storm
"Move an inch and you'll be dead
"You are standing underneath
"The Towers of the Teeth and the Eye blazes red
"Win the battle lose the war
"Choice of evils lie before your feet
"Retreat, retreat, retreat"
Silence!
Come forth!
The King of Gondor...
...demands the Black Lord to come forth...
...atone for his evils and depart them forever!
Come forth!
I am the mouth of Sauron!
His emissary, you mean.
For you be no wraith, but made from flesh and blood...
...beneath that mask and those robes, even as I!
Is there anyone in this rout with authority to treat with me?
Not thou, Aragorn.
It needs more to make a king than a rabble such as this.
We shall see!
Be warned.
You are hopelessly outnumbered here.
Our decision is made.
Be gone!
We did not come here to waste words in treating with the likes of you...
...one of Sauron's slaves.
Be gone!
We will meet your armies!
"You are standing in the eye of the storm
"Move an inch and you'll be dead
"You are standing underneath
The Towers of the Teeth
"And the Eye blazes red"
As I faced my own, almost certain death...
...I wondered, "Has he the Ring?
"Has Sauron really got the Ring?
"Where is the Ring?"
Had I but known that deep in the bowels of Mount Doom...
...Samwise had been searching these many days for his master...
...until he himself had reached the core, the fiery forge itself.
And this, at last, is it...
...the end of Frodo's quest.
But instead of his triumph, it ends with his madness.
What's that?
Gollum!
Here?
Fighting with something that is not there?
Mr. Frodo!
Invisible!
"Frodo of the nine fingers
"And the Ring of Doom
"Why does he have nine fingers"
Mr. Frodo!
"Where is the Ring of Doom?"
Precious! Precious!
My Precious!
My master! Your poor hand!
My master!
'Tis better this way!
'Tis better than that madness!
Look!
Mine!
Precious!
Gollum has completed our quest.
The Ring is destroyed in the fires where it was wrought!
At last...
...the Ring exists no more!
She's erupting!
Quick, master, back through these cracks, run.
All Mordor is being destroyed!
How?
How? There is but one answer.
The ring bearer has fulfilled his quest.
The realm of Sauron is ended!
And with him, us!
For the quake cannot tell good from evil.
Look! See ye!
The Lord of the Eagles and his legions!
Our armies are saved!
It's no use! The lava will have us!
I am glad you are with me here at the end of all things, Sam.
And you with me, master.
I don't want to give up yet.
It's not like me somehow, if you understand.
Maybe not, Sam.
But it's like things are in the world.
Hopes fail.
An end comes.
There is no escape.
Die well, Samwise!
Yes, once again...
...as he had so many times in the past...
...Gwaihir, the magnificent Lord of
The Eagles, had come to our rescue.
The mighty war birds returned us to Minas-Tirith...
...where months later...
...our dead buried, our wounded healed...
...the fields of Pelennor green with springtime...
...the city cleansed and rebuilt...
...the standard of King Aragorn was raised finally...
...to the top of the White Tower.
And down below, the restored Great Gate swung open...
...and King Aragorn officially took possession of his capital city.
Behold! The return of the King!
"The end of the Ring, the return of the King
"A new age has come to the land
"The end of the Ring, the return of the King
"He shall rule with a true healing hand
"The quest is done
"The battle won
"And all have lost in the winning
"Oft hope is born
"When all's forlorn
"And there's a new beginning
"He who had the courage not to fail
"The bearer of the Ring we hail
"Praise them
"Praise them
"Praise them with great praise
"Praise them with great praise
"The end of the Ring, the return of the King
"A new age has come to the land
"The end of the Ring, the return of the King
"He shall rule
"With a true
"Healing hand"
"Frodo of the nine fingers
"And the Ring of Doom"
And now we all know.
But alas, look.
Just resting my eyes.
Sweet Bilbo, you will return with us tomorrow to Hobbitown...
...where you may rest your eyes as much as you wish.
Return?
Nay.
On the morrow...
...I depart with Elrond and Gandalf.
Depart?
From the Gray Havens.
On the white ship.
What means this?
We are old, our job is done.
The Third Age of Middle-earth is over...
...and as we pass on to the lands beyond the sea...
...the new age of Man begins.
I shall miss you.
But I thought only Elves departed thus.
How can Bilbo join you?
Bilbo has served us well.
There is always room for a friend.
Have I served thee well?
Need you ask such a question?
I have grown weary of this world.
The weight of the Ring all of these years...
...has worn me far beyond my age.
I would, if it pleases you...
...set sail with you on the morrow.
Good friend, savior of all we hold precious...
...of course thou might join us.
Mr. Frodo.
We cannot be parted.
But, must I go, too?
Nay, dear Sam.
You are still young in spirit.
You and Merry and Pippin.
A good life awaits you back in the Shire.
With plump Hobbit wives...
...good Hobbit meals...
...Iong leisurely smokings of good Hobbit pipes.
And laps filled with bouncing Hobbit babies.
Now you must keep the book of the Hobbits up to date.
I will.
The Orcs and Trolls have gone to dust...
...the Elves are slowly departing.
Dwarves have disappeared into their misty mountains...
...and there have been no dragons for ages.
Right!
What troubles you, Sam?
Will there be no room for Hobbits in this new age of Man?
I think so. For of us all,
Hobbits are the closest to Man...
...the most human.
And one day they will be as Men are.
Look you.
Frodo is a bit larger than Bilbo, just as you are larger than Frodo.
And younger still than you, and larger are Merry and Pippin.
And, if you keep the book of the Hobbits as Frodo asked...
...ages from now, when your stories are still told...
...there will be those humans who might well wonder, "Is there Hobbit in me?"
Is there?
"Roads go ever, ever on
"To the lands beyond the sea
"On a white ship will I sail
"Watching shadows part for me
"Leaving havens gray with rain
"Now that years have slipped away
"Leaving friends with gentle pain
"As they start another day
"Roads I traveled I must leave
"For I've turned the final bend
"Weep not empty tears but grieve
"As the road comes to an end
"It's so easy not to try
"Let the world go drifting by
"If you never say hello
"You won't have to say goodbye"
And lo, as foretold...
...the epoch of The Return of the King ends at the beginning...
...of the new age of Man.
"If you never say hello
"You won't have to say goodbye"

Impossible.
Nothing is impossible.
Come on, Mouse.
Dig! Dig!
Mouse, come on.
- Jehan.
- Yes, sir.
Get the next three.
Two more.
- Over there.
- Hurry up!
- Move!
- Take two.
- I want Phillipe Gaston.
- This is the cell, sir.
Wrong cell. I want Phillipe Gaston, the one they call the Mouse.
The Mouse? The Mouse.
The Mouse... he left our house.
No Mouse today.
He's run away.
To ease the pain, he-he... he's down the drain!
- Where is he?
- I already told you, gentle lord.
Hang him. Search every sewer, every drain.
Find him, or captain Marquet will hang you in his place.
You can't hang me!
Impossible. Nobody could escape through there.
It's not unlike escaping mother's womb.
God, what a memory.
Out of the way!
Lord, I will never pick another pocket again as long as I live, I swear it.
But here's the problem.
If you don't let me live, how can I prove my good faith to you?
If you've heard me, this ledge will remain steady as a rock, and that thing coming at me won't be what I think it is.
If it is, there's no hard feelings, of course, but I'd be very disappointed.
I don't believe it.
I believe it.
I'm coming. I'm coming!
It's Phillipe, Lord.
Phillipe.
You won't regret this, Lord.
I'm a wonderful person.
Boy...
Hello.
What are you doing down there?
Get away!
Get away, get away, get away!
Come back. Come back!
There's disturbing news, your Grace.
One of the prisoners has escaped.
No one ever escapes from the dungeons of Aquila, Marquet.
The people of this city accept that as a historical fact.
- The responsibility is mine.
- Yes.
It would be a miracle if he manages to get through the sewage system.
I believe in miracles, Marquet.
It's part of my job.
At any rate, your Grace, it is only one insignificant, petty thief.
Great storms announce themselves with a simple breeze, captain.
And a single random spark can ignite the fires of rebellion.
If he is out there, your Grace,
I shall find him.
Yes.
Take 10 men towards Chenet!
We ride north to Gavroche!
The name of the man who finds Phillipe Gaston will be brought to the personal attention of the bishop, as will the body of the man who lets him get away!
Open the gates!
I know I promised, Lord.
Never again.
But I also know that you know what a weak-willed person I am.
Come on, Mouse. Keep going.
Not much farther.
About 350 miles.
That's all.
A nice, hot piece of cabbage, like my dear, old mother used to cook.
Wolf. Wolf.
Please, no wolf.
A joint of lamb.
Where the hell am I?
Hot lamb. Hot lamb.
A little sauce on it.
Maybe some of that green stuff... little Bertram used to put on it.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Look up there.
He's taking daddy's shoes.
You've got it, little darlings.
Innkeeper.
- A drink of your most expensive.
- Yeah, yeah. Show me your money.
Copper, my friend.
And the same for anyone who will join me in a toast.
Let's hear your toast.
We drink to a special man, my friend.
Someone who has been inside the dungeons of Aquila and lived to tell the tale.
Then you drink to me, little man.
I've seen those dungeons.
A blacksmith, perhaps?
A carpenter? A stonecutter, even?
But a prisoner from inside Aquila?
I didn't say
I was a prisoner.
If you'd stuck to the woods, you may have stood a chance, Gaston.
You're right.
Get him.
Move! Move!
Get out of the way.
You, I said, out!
I'm so terribly sorry.
Kill him.
May God have mercy on my soul!
You, out.
One of my men told me you returned.
I wanted to cut his throat for lying, cause I knew you weren't that stupid.
- Captain Navarre.
- Francesco.
Captain?
Navarre!
I won't hurt you.
I'm a wonderful person.
After him!
Sweet ponies. Sweet ponies.
Gentle... Come here. You filthy strumpets!
No. No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no.
No!
Must be somebody's home.
There's smoke.
Are you sure you don't want to ride on, sir?
There's still plenty of light.
Stop your chattering.
We'll spend the night here.
Give me the axe.
The axe.
Good afternoon, sir.
My lady.
My comrade-in-arms and I need lodging for the night.
No. No place for you here.
We'll pay for it, of course.
We are not above compassion for those in misery.
You may sleep down there, in the barn.
Thank you.
Sir? Sir, are you there?
If there's nothing else I can do,
I think I'll turn in.
- You can take care of my horse.
- All right.
And sleep with one eye open.
And don't disturb me.
I'm liable to take your head off before I know it's you.
All right.
Come on, old girl.
Come on.
Stubborn little lady.
What's her name?
His name is Goliath.
His name? Pretty name.
Go with him, boy.
He didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
Come on.
Goliath, before we get to know each other better,
I feel I should tell you a story about a teeny, little man named David.
One... day.
"Comrade-in-arms."
Slave's more like it.
See to the fire, feed the animals, gather the wood...
Look at me, Lord.
I was better off in the dungeons of Aquila.
My cellmate was insane and a murderer, but he respected me.
He's a strange one, Navarre.
Why did he save my life?
He wants something from me.
I can see it in his eyes.
Well, whatever it is,
I'm not going to do it.
I'm still a young man, you know.
I've got prospects!
I'm off to find my golden future, captain.
So, goodbye and good...
Hello?
Who do you think is out there?
You'd better draw your sword, Pierre.
Ah! Louis, you brought your crossbow.
We'll all go back to the barn now, all right?
All right. All right.
Show no mercy, Pierre!
We're not interested in prisoners.
Hold your ground, Louis.
I'll run ahead and get some help.
Captain! Sir! Captain!
Sir! Sir! Sir!
Wolf! Wolf! Wolf!
Sir! Sir!
Wolf! Wolf!
Wolf. Wolf.
Wolf! Wolf! Wolf!
Shh...
Don't go out there!
Don't go out there!
There's a wolf, a big wolf.
The biggest wolf you've ever seen, and a dead man.
I know.
Miss! Please!
Maybe I'm dreaming.
But my eyes are open, which means maybe I'm awake dreaming I'm asleep.
Or... or more likely, maybe... I'm asleep, dreaming that I'm awake wondering if I'm dreaming.
You are dreaming.
I have not seen what I have just seen.
I do not believe what I believe, Lord.
These are magical, unexplainable matters, and I beg you not to make me a part of them.
We'll stop now.
Not a great day for traveling.
Come on, old girl.
Come on...
I mean, boy. Goliath.
Come on, Goliath.
Come on.
It's cold out here. Come on!
I could do with some rest myself, after last night's goings-on.
The wolf would have killed me.
It was horrible.
But he... tore the farmer's throat out and left me alone.
And there was more.
There was a woman, like fine porcelain, with deep blue eyes.
Almost like a bird's.
And her voice, the dulcet tones of an angel.
She spoke?
What did she say?
I asked her if I was dreaming.
She said I was.
Hmm.
I'm not insane. You must believe me when I tell you these things.
No, I believe you.
I believe in dreams.
I see.
This lady... did she perhaps have a name?
Not that she mentioned. Why?
Well, she might wander into my dreams.
Wouldn't it be nice if I could call her by name and pretend we'd met before?
I've waited a long time for such a lady.
Now, get some sleep.
The bird will alert us if anyone comes.
I've got to be out of my mind.
Out of my mind.
Open the gate!
Open the gate!
Have you found the criminal,
Gaston?
He is not in my custody at this time.
Then why do you invade my garden, unwashed, unshaved?
Do you think to find him here?
Navarre has returned.
Walk with me.
The criminal, Gaston, travels with him.
My men are combing the woods.
And the hawk?
- Your Grace?
- There must be a hawk.
A spirited hawk.
This hawk is not to be harmed.
Is that understood?
You see, the day she dies, a new captain of the guard will preside at your execution.
We live in difficult times, Marquet.
This famine has prevented the people from paying their proper tribute to the Church.
I raise their taxes only to be told that there is nothing left for me to tax. Imagine.
But last night, the Lord Almighty visited me in my sleep.
He told me that Satan's messenger is traveling amongst us. And that his name... is Etienne of Navarre.
Go.
To break faith with me is to break faith with Him.
- Get me Cezar.
- Yes, your Grace.
This sword has been in my family for five generations.
It has never known defeat, until now.
This jewel represents my family name.
This one... is our alliance with the Holy Church in Rome.
This one... was my father's, from the Crusades.
And this...
- Sir, you don't think I took that one?
- No.
This is mine to fill.
Each generation is called upon to follow its own quest.
And what is your quest?
I must kill a man.
Tell me, does this walking corpse have a name?
His Grace, the bishop of Aquila.
The bishop. I see.
Well... Well, then you have much to do.
And I've already been enough of a burden to you.
I do hope our paths cross again one day.
I need you to guide me into the city.
Not for the life of my mother, even if I knew who she was.
You're the only one who has ever escaped from there.
It was chance, pure chance.
A miracle. Once in a lifetime.
I fell down a hole, and followed my nose.
I have waited almost two years for a sign from God.
So when I heard the warning bells of Aquila,
I knew the moment of my destiny had come.
You will be my guiding angel.
Me?
Sir, the truth is
I talk to God all the time.
And, no offense, but he never mentioned you.
No?
There are strange forces at work in your life.
Magical ones that surround you.
I don't understand them, but they frighten me.
You have given me my life.
The truth is
I can never repay you.
I have no honor.
I never will have.
I don't think that you would kill me for being what I am.
But... better that, than to return to Aquila.
I'll gather some wood for the fire.
- Got you.
- Miss?
My lady? Up here.
Damn.
You remember me?
What are you doing up there?
What am I doing?
Yes, you might ask that.
The bishop's guards.
A dozen of them.
We had a terrible fight.
- Why didn't they kill you?
- Why didn't they?
That's a good question.
I asked them that myself.
- And?
- "And"?
And what did they say?
They said that... that they preferred to leave that honor to the bishop.
Oh.
They're coming back.
- They are, are they?
- Please, my lady.
A giant owl examined me quite closely, not one minute ago.
Please?
Please.
You're very kind.
Listen.
Thank you very much, my lady.
Tell the captain he ties a wicked knot.
He's gonna kill me.
Good morning.
Let's go find Phillipe.
Well, well.
A long way from the sewers, little rat.
This time the drinks are on me.
- Where's Navarre?
- Navarre? Navarre?
Oh, yes. Yes.
Big man, black horse?
Uh... I saw him riding south, toward Aquila.
Then, we ride north, sir.
It's not polite to assume somebody is a liar when you've only just met them.
And yet, you knew we would.
We ride south, toward Aquila.
- I told the truth, Lord.
- Move.
How can I learn any moral lessons if you keep confusing me like this?
Hawk!
No.
Easy.
You'll be all right.
Oh, no.
Get me a piece of cloth from my saddlebag.
Easy. Don't be afraid.
It's all right.
It's all right.
Thanks.
You'll be all right.
You'll be fine.
You'll live.
Take her. Find help.
- Me, sir?
- You're the only one I have.
- But, sir, the poor thing is done for.
- Don't you say that!
Follow that road, you'll find a ruined castle.
There's a monk named Imperius.
Give him the hawk.
He will know what to do.
- Sir, I don't think you understand...
- Get on my horse.
You're the only one who can ride him.
You will do as I tell you.
Get on my horse. Now!
Careful.
And know this, you fail, I will follow you the length of my days.
And I will find you.
Go. Run.
Go!
There it is, see? The castle.
We'll be there soon.
Well.
Well, that's gratitude for you.
All right, then.
Let this Imperius fellow watch you die.
I've got my own life to live after.
Please.
Hello!
Hello, up there!
For pity's sake, hello!
Hello, hello!
What do you want down there?
I was told to bring you this bird.
It's been wounded.
Oh, good shot!
Bring it in, we'll dine together.
We can't eat this bird!
Why not? Oh, God, is it Lent again already?
This is no ordinary hawk, father.
It belongs to a man named Navarre.
Mother of God.
Bring her in! Bring her in! Quickly!
Stay.
Good bird.
Up here, boy. Hurry!
Hurry!
Oh...
Here. Up here.
This way.
Now, careful.
Walk on the left side. On the left.
There.
Gently.
Gently.
Now, leave us.
- Can I help?
- Go out, boy.
Don't be frightened.
Navarre was right.
I know what to do.
We must wait a little.
Now then, where is that...
There we are.
Now then, what am I gonna need?
Celeriac, rosemary, thyme.
Oh. Did I light the fire?
It's late.
Thyme, I need thyme.
Now, I need a root.
There! That's it.
Navarre. Is he...?
He's fine.
He's just fine, my lady.
There was a terrible battle.
Navarre fought like a lion.
The hawk...
The hawk was struck.
You know that, don't you?
Yes.
Are you flesh?
Or are you spirit?
I am sorrow.
How...?
Get out.
Out, out.
This time, stay out!
Ready?
Forgive me, your Grace.
Cezar has arrived.
It's him, isn't it?
- The wolf. Somehow, it's him.
- Drink. Forget.
An hour ago you were drunk, and you remembered.
- What do they call you, boy?
- Phillipe Gaston.
Uh-huh.
Her name is
Isabeau d'Anjou.
Her father was the comte d'Anjou, an intemperate fellow.
He died slaughtering Saracens in Antioch.
She came to live with a cousin,
I think it was, in Aquila.
I shall never forget the first time
I saw her. It was like looking at...
The face of love.
Ah, you, too.
Well, I suppose we were all in love with her in different ways.
Even his Grace, the bishop, could think of nothing else.
The bishop loved her?
As near as that evil man could come to it.
His passion was a sort of madness.
He was a man possessed.
But Isabeau sensed his wickedness, and she shrank from him.
She sent back all his letters unopened, his poems unread.
Her heart was already lost, you see, to the captain of the guard.
Etienne Navarre!
The bishop knew nothing of their love.
But every day saw it grow stronger and deeper and richer.
Until...
Until?
They were betrayed.
They shared the same confessor, a weak and foolish priest.
And one day, in a drunken confession to his superior, he committed a mortal sin.
He revealed the lovers' secret vows to the bishop.
The old fool didn't realize what he had done at first, nor the terrible revenge the bishop would take.
His Grace seemed to go mad.
He lost both his sanctity and his reason.
He swore that if he could not have her, no man would.
So, Navarre and Isabeau fled from the town of Aquila.
But the bishop followed, never more than an hour behind, and more persistent than a hound.
An evil man, a powerful man, hated and feared.
Rejected even by Rome herself.
He called upon the powers of darkness for the means to damn the lovers.
In his fury and frustration, he struck a dreadful bargain... with the evil one.
The dark powers of hell spat up a terrible curse, and you have seen it working.
By day, Isabeau is the beautiful bird you brought to me.
And by night, as you have already guessed, the voice of the wolf that we hear is the cry of Navarre.
Poor, dumb creatures with no memory of the half-life of their human existence.
Never touching in the flesh.
Only the anguish of a split second at sunrise and sunset when they can almost touch... but not.
Always together.
Eternally apart.
As long as the sun rises and sets, as long as there is day and night.
And for as long as they both shall live.
You have stumbled onto a tragic story, Phillipe Gaston.
And now, whether you like it or not, you are lost in it, with the rest of us.
Useless.
All of them.
My traps are full.
I can't kill every wolf that lives.
Since the plague, there are more wolves than men.
And there's a woman.
Your Grace?
A beautiful woman with alabaster skin, and the eyes of a dove.
She travels by night, only by night.
Her sun is the moon.
And her name is...
Isabeau.
Find her, and you find the wolf.
The wolf I want.
The wolf who... loves her.
A black wolf.
Isabeau.
Don't. Don't.
You might start bleeding again.
Tell me your name.
Most people call me
Phillipe the Mouse.
You travel with him, don't you?
Yes.
"You must save this hawk", he said.
"For she is my life, my last and best reason for living."
And then he said...
"One day we will know such happiness as two people dream of, but never do."
He said that?
I swear it on my life.
- Does she know?
- What?
That you were the priest that betrayed them?
God has declared an end to it, at last.
He has given me the knowledge to undo what I have done.
After two years, he has brought us back together again.
Make yourself clear, if you can.
I have found a way to break the curse and a time for Navarre to confront the bishop and to begin his own true life again.
He intends to confront the bishop, to kill him with the sword of his ancestors.
No, he mustn't do that.
He can't.
If he kills the bishop, the curse can never be broken.
Go look after Isabeau, boy.
Go, quickly.
Open up the door, in the name of his Holiness, the bishop of Aquila!
Be off with you!
This is a house of God, not a... brothel!
I said open up, in the name of the bishop!
I met the bishop, you blasphemous lout!
And you look nothing like him.
- Break it in!
- Yes, sir.
Left side, left side, left side.
Come on.
My lady. My lady.
Come with me.
- What is it?
- Don't talk, come with me.
Sorry!
I am a monk, not an architect!
Move, imbecile!
In here, my lady.
This way, my chum.
Straight through the big main doors.
And don't forget...
Walk on the left side.
Careful. Hurry.
Go back! Go back!
Back inside! Run!
I got you!
He's got me!
Get off, get off, get off!
Get off of me.
My boots!
- Phillipe, it's me they're after.
- Don't flatter yourself.
Hold me!
I'm slipping!
No!
You!
- Where's the woman?
- She flew away.
- Where is she?
- God's truth, she flew away!
You...
It always pays to tell the truth, Lord.
Thank you.
I see that now.
I thought you might have been dead, old man.
There were times
I wanted to kill you myself.
But... I'm very grateful... for this.
No, it is I who should be grateful to have the chance to redeem myself, and to save you and Isabeau, because God has told me how the curse may be broken.
You have betrayed us once.
I warn you.
Three days hence, the bishop will hear the confession of the clergy in the cathedral in Aquila.
All you have to do is confront him, both of you, as man and woman, in the flesh.
And the curse... will be confounded, broken.
And both of you will be free!
- Impossible.
- As long as there is night and day, no.
But three days hence in Aquila, there will be a day without a night and a night without a day.
Go back inside, old man.
Go back to your drink.
You think I'm drunk?
I swear to you!
God has shown me!
He has forgiven me.
He hasn't forgiven you.
He's made you mad.
Sir. Sir.
It's all right, father.
Sir?
Sir. Sir.
How's your shoulder?
- I'm in your debt.
- Me, sir? No, no, not at all.
She wanted me to deliver a message, to say she still has hope, faith in you.
- You are free to go.
- I know that, sir.
- Do as you like.
- Yes, sir.
Then you and Ladyhawke will be going on to Aquila?
Ladyhawke?
Yes.
Well... It just so happens... I'm heading in that general direction myself.
Really?
Then you better grab your things.
I'm leaving now.
Right.
Ladyhawke.
Imperius, I'm leaving with the captain. Follow us.
But if the old man's right about breaking the curse, if you and Isabeau could face the bishop together, as man and woman...
You will not mention that again.
Not to me, not to her.
Understood?
Abraham, will you get a move on?
Looks like a big one, captain.
We're gonna get soaked.
Find shelter.
Come here.
- The sun is going down.
- How can you tell?
After so many sunsets?
Take care of Ladyhawke.
Tell her I love her.
You hungry?
Do you understand me,
Ladyhawke?
You know, it's my favorite thing for dinner, hawk.
I've eaten thousands of them.
Used to kill one every night.
Serves me right for getting involved in this nightmare.
Nightmare, daymare.
And then "A night without day, a day without night."
What's that supposed to mean?
Makes about as much sense as the rest of it.
Uh-oh.
Sunset.
I'll wait outside.
Hold on for a minute.
I can't vouch for the fit.
Take your time, my lady.
Miss.
My lady?
I'm coming in.
Miss?
Miss?
It's me, remember?
You?
Yeah.
Thank you.
- How is he?
- He's alive, like you.
He's full of hope, like you.
He left you in my charge.
He said "Tell her we two speak as one,
"and she will follow your instructions as my own."
Really?
- I...
- No, don't swear.
Good evening, Goliath.
He's taking us back to Aquila, isn't he?
Well, what do you instruct?
I instruct you to sit by a warm fire, to drink a cup of sweet wine, and to listen to bright music, cheerfully played.
Perhaps, dance.
Shall we, my lady?
Dance?
- Now?
- Practice.
Oh, my.
It has been a long time, Phillipe.
I'll take my cup of sweet wine now.
All right.
So... You intend to be my protector, as well? I'm flattered.
Actually, the truth is, he'll kill me if I lose it.
- You stole my dress?
- I wouldn't...
Isabeau. Isabeau.
Isabeau. Isabeau...
- Get inside.
- No!
Get inside!
If you lay one hand on her, you'll find it on the ground, next to your head!
- Now, ride on!
- Easy, little man, you're frightening me.
Are you deaf?
Ride on!
Turn around and you're dead!
What a terrible night.
Isabeau! Isabeau.
Isabeau!
Isabeau!
He'll kill me.
He'll kill me.
Show yourself, coward!
My beauty.
Navarre!
Black wolf.
Oh, do get on,
Abraham.
Go on, faster.
It's going to snow soon.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
- You look a little pale.
I got you something to eat.
What a night.
What happened?
Oh, nothing I couldn't handle, captain.
It's a good little hawk.
Nice bird.
Go on now.
Go to your master.
- Go on, Ladyhawke.
- Last night...
- Captain?
- Tell me about it.
What's to tell? Go on now.
Go on. Go, go, go!
We ran into a bit of trouble on our way to an inn.
You took Isabeau to an inn?
First, we had to go to a stable.
Fly to your master, fly to the one you love.
- What did you do in a stable?
- We changed clothes.
- What?
- Not together, of course.
- You left her alone?
- No, never.
- So, you did change?
- No, no, no. No.
- Take her.
- Come here.
Take her, take her, take her.
She's the most wonderful woman that ever lived.
And I can't say
I haven't had my fantasies.
But the truth is, all she did was talk about you.
Every moment you spend with her,
I... envy you.
But you can tell me.
Tell me everything that she said.
And I warn you,
I will know if the words are hers.
She was sad at first.
She talked about the day you met... and she cursed it.
But then I saw her remember how happy you were together, before the bishop's curse, and her eyes glowed.
No, she glowed.
She loves you more than life, captain.
She's had to.
Do you know that hawks and wolves mate for life?
Yeah.
The bishop didn't even leave us that.
Not even that.
On your way to kill his Grace?
Why won't you listen to me?
In two days' time, you can face the bishop in the cathedral with Isabeau by your side and break the curse.
I will be in Aquila tomorrow.
And one way or another, there will finally be an end to it.
One day, more or less.
- What could it matter?
- You, too?
I warned you.
- Stay here, then, with the old man.
- No. I'm going with you.
How will you get inside the cathedral without me?
I will get in, without your help.
Thank you for trying, Phillipe, and for standing up for the truth.
I should've known better.
Every happy moment in my life has come from lying.
There you are, little Mouse.
Where is my knife?
- Isabeau?
- I just had it here.
Now, what have I done with it?
Isabeau, this may be our last evening together.
- Why?
- I didn't want to tell you until I believed.
I mean, really believed.
Really believed what,
Phillipe?
I think we can break the curse.
We have a plan.
- You and Navarre?
- No.
Must you keep thumping me in the liver?
Imperius, this hole's not big enough for the two of us.
Well, let's hope it's big enough for the wolf.
Ow!
What are you doing?
When you kneel before the altar, how do you get up again?
You sacrilegious young imp!
Go on, push. Blast you!
And more. Again!
And again! Up!
Up!
He's coming! He's coming!
- Phillipe!
- My lady, my lady, we're just covering the trap.
All right. Hurry.
He's coming across the ice.
- Wait, my lady.
- Phillipe! Help me!
The ice, it will break!
Lie down! Lie down!
He can't get out!
Wait!
Wait, my lady!
Oh, God, Phillipe!
I can't make it!
- Hurry!
- I'm coming.
Hurry, boy!
We'll lose him!
Wait!
He's too heavy!
He's too...
Phillipe...
No! He's slipping! He's...
Hold him!
Stop! Be careful!
No!
Isabeau!
No!
Isabeau, hold him up!
- No! Phillipe!
- Phillipe! No!
Phillipe!
No! No!
Push. Push.
It's all right.
Hold on.
Hold on, boy!
We must live, father.
As human beings.
Our lives are in your hands now.
Tell me one thing.
Where is my father's sword?
It's gone.
It fell through the ice last night, crossing the river.
Damn you.
That sword was the last bit of honor I possessed.
There is no mission of honor now.
The jewel that you wished to place in your sword hilt has become a symbol of your meaningless death.
But there is a chance for life now.
A new life with her.
I needed that sword to kill the bishop!
Navarre, listen to him!
- Damn you!
- Go ahead then.
Kill yourself!
Kill her, too!
You never cared for her as much as yourself anyway.
What is that?
That happened last night, when he saved your life.
Forgive me.
I'll show you idiots how to cage a wolf.
Quickly!
Get out of the way there!
Remember, the cul-de-sac is by the great north wall.
Right, right.
Cul-de-sac, great north wall.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
We have come full circle, Lord.
I would like to think that there is some higher meaning in all of this.
Certainly would reflect well on you.
Halt!
What have we here, little father?
Oh, a surprise present, my son, for his Grace, the bishop, from the people of my parish.
A fine pelt for his wall.
What have we here?
I've never had the pleasure of killing a wolf before.
How strange.
That's exactly what the bishop said.
I'm sure he will understand your depriving him of that pleasure.
He's a very forgiving sort of man.
Very well. Pass on.
Wisdom is beyond price, my son.
Be grateful that you have it.
- Your Grace?
- When I am ready.
It should be soon now.
Once the clouds break.
It's day, old man.
Like it was yesterday, like it will be tomorrow.
Oh, no.
Damn.
- What's the matter?
- Rats.
Rats? Here?
Scandalous.
There's no time left.
The mass will be over soon.
I cannot wait for you now.
If Phillipe has done his job,
I can kill the bishop now or never.
No, Etienne, this chance will never come again!
You're right.
If this service ends peacefully, the cathedral bells begin to toll, and you will know I have failed.
But Isabeau...
I... beg you, take her life.
- Quick and painless.
- I can't do that.
Yes, you can.
I beg you.
The cruelty would be to damn her to a half-life.
And that is not what she wants.
I couldn't do it.
Have you ever considered that this is what God intended all along?
As the one who was your captain and through God's grace will be once again,
I ask you to let me pass.
Captain Navarre,
I have my orders.
Damn it, open!
Come on.
Navarre!
Thank you, Lord.
Night without a day.
Day without a night.
Dear Lord, go with him.
Be with him.
Imperius! Wait!
No!
You're dead.
Stop!
Imperius... make it quick.
God, forgive me.
But kill me, Navarre, and the curse will go on forever.
We must think of Isabeau.
Isabeau... is dead.
Damn you.
- Damn you to hell.
- Navarre!
Look at her.
Look at her!
Look at me.
Now, look at us.
Look at us!
It's over. It's broken.
And no man shall...
Navarre!
Isabeau...
Oh, my God!
You cut your hair.
I love you.
- Isabeau.
- Navarre.
You two!
Come here.
May God's blessings be with you both, from this day forward.
I bless the day he brought you back to us, father.
And you. And you.
The truest friend we could ever have.
Thank you.
I fully expect to meet you at the Pearly Gates, little thief.
Don't you dare disappoint me.
I'll meet you there, father.
Even if I have to pick the lock.
Isabeau!
I love you! I love you!
Chances are cos
I wear a silly grin.
The moment you come into view.
Chances are you think that
I'm in love with you.
Just because my composure sorta slips.
The moment that your lips meet mine.
Chances are you think my heart's your valentine.
In the magic of moonlight.
When sigh hold me close, dear.
Chances are you believe the stars that fill the skies.
Are in my eyes.
Guess you feel you'll always be.
The one and only one for me.
And if you think you could.
Well, chances are Your chances are.
Awfully good
Louie...
There's something
I have to tell you.
Now?
I'm in love with Corinne.
I know.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God and in the face of this company to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony, which is an honourable state, instituted of God...

Louie?
Louie?
Happy anniversary!
- You're dressed.
- Yeah, but I don't have to be.
Well, get undressed and get back in bed. I have something for you.
- Well, can't you give it to me here?
- No, I want to give it to you there.
Come on!
OK.
No, Louie. That's not the way I planned it.
So this is a planned thing.
Yes. I wanted to be here in bed when I gave you your anniversary present, because this is where it was made.
We're having a baby?
A baby?!
Philip!
To be happy for the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife.
Though from my personal point of view
Philip!
I started without you.
Happy anniversary!
What is this?
A cherry tree. And it promises to bear fruit.
- Which is more than I can say for you two!
- You shouldn't have.
To my two favourite people.
Philip?
We're having a baby.
How are we going to break the news to Louie?
Philip...!
- Are you working today?
- Lady Bird's launching a new petunia bed.
I'm the lucky stiff who gets to cover it. Not to be missed!
- Big interview?
- Yes, I'm interviewing Lady Bird's gardener.
Philip, I think we'll call the tree George.
Bye.
- Philip!
- Hey, now don't forget. 8 o'clock.
Remember my cousin Ann?
She was at our wedding?
- The one with the overbite?
- She's having them worked on!
She's coming up from
Charlottesville for the weekend.
- Maybe the four of us could get together.
- Louie...!
- Well, OK. Just thought I'd ask.
- Don't ask.
Good time...
Bye!
Mr Jeffries! Come in.
Come in, come in!
She is going to love these.
An excellent choice.
Give my regards to your wife.
And happy anniversary!
In view of the testimony of the witness and the arguments of counsel,
I have decided to grant the defendant's motion to suppress the evidence.
Permission to approach the bench, Judge Fenwick.
Approach.
Your Honour, I won't have a case.
Without that evidence, the counts against Tony Bonino are out the window.
I have to follow the rules of evidence, Louie.
In my judgement a search warrant was required, therefore the evidence is inadmissible.
But he'll be back on the streets.
We know Bonino is one of the most cunning and powerful individuals in organised crime.
Are you quite through?
Court is adjourned.
Jeffries.
Listen, I've got something here.
- It's a tip or something.
- Yeah? What is it?
- Something on Bonino.
- Bonino?
- Interested huh?
- Oh, yes, I'm interested!
The beach, Roosevelt Island. 6.30.
Judge Fenwick! My God!
- Excuse me.
- Yes? Hi.
I have to get out of here.
How do I get back?
You just got here, hon.
You haven't been processed.
You'll get back. It just takes a little while.
- Wait at the end of the line, please.
- Uh, look, you don't understand.
I have to get back to my wife.
She's pregnant.
And my best friend, Philip... he'll be lost without me.
And my job. I'll lose my job, my dinner reservations, my life.
We understand those things here. We really do.
Come with me.
Thanks. I've been feeling very strange lately.
What do you expect? Your body's a cream sauce all over Wisconsin Avenue!
Here it is, end of the line. Thank you very much, and please wait.
How are you doing? Fine?
Corinne!
- No, no, no. You're making a scene.
- Cori...!
All right, all right!
Come with me.
Good. Just one more thing...
Bye.
Here's your shot. Hold still.
OK?
Omar? Omar!
Hopeless case of attachment.
- They'll take care of you here.
- Thanks. Thanks a lot.
I need to go to Washington DC.
That's in North America.
I know where Washington is, thank you. Boy or a girl?
- What's that?
- You want to be reborn a boy or a girl?
I don't want to be reborn at all.
I want to go home now, just as I am.
That's impossible. You're between bodies right now.
Look, you're a soul, a spirit. The only way to get back is to be reborn.
- You got a problem with that?
- I guess not.
- As I was saying, boy or girl?
- Boy.
- OK, there's an Eskimo woman giving birth...
- No, I don't want to be an Eskimo.
Son of an African chief. You'll inherit ten wives on your 16th...
No! No, I have a wife.
OK. Uh, here's an interesting situation.
Rodeo Drive, Beverly Hills.
- Great location.
- No. East coast, OK? East coast.
Pool or trust fund?! We can get you there in three months.
I can't wait!
You're really in a hurry, huh? OK...
Cleveland. It's the closest
I've got to Washington.
There's a woman about to deliver there, Marlene Finch.
- Fine!
- Her husband's name is Roger, who's an Elk.
- He owns a dry-cl...
- I'll take it!
Oh, OK. She's going into labour!
You'd better hurry.
How will we recognise each other?
Don't worry. Go, go, go!
Whoa! Whoa! Wait a minute!
I forgot! Your shot!
You go to... You need... I...
Omar? What happened?
- He had to run.
- He had to run?
And? And what, Omar? And what?
A... a...
And you... forgot to give him his inoculation?
He can't go through life without that.
Sally, please...
What if he remembers?
This is a pretty situation!
So you just assumed that nobody at Yale University or Yale Law School had any interest in checking out these six books in the last three months?
No, I just...
You are going to make some lawyer!
You owe eighty-seven dollars and twenty-five cents.
87.25. Can I put that on a credit card?
This isn't a boutique.
Cash only, or we'll hold up your grades.
I don't have enough cash.
I'm... I'm going home right now and my ride's waiting for me.
Mrs Handy? The rare books room.
- The Shakespeare folios.
- Yes, Alex. What about them?
They're fooling with the folios.
- Fooling with the folios?
- And fiddling too.
- Go! Go to them!
- Yes. Thank you.
I'll take over here.
Oh dear Oh! Good heavens
God, is she always that awful?
Mom?
No.
I'm sorry.
I just didn't have enough cash, and she wouldn't take a credit card.
And... I can't get my grades.
My ride's waiting...
What? What?
This is bad.
- How bad?
- It's worse than I thought.
- How worse?
- A lot.
According to this, these books were never legally checked out.
Yeah, so?
So it means I can't charge you for them.
You beat the system.
Yeah.
- Alex.
- Alex?
Miranda.
Thank you. That was really sweet of you.
Consider it a graduation present.
- I'm not graduating.
- I am. Tomorrow.
Oh, yeah? Congratulations.
I got to go.
OK.
Bye.
- That wasn't really your mother, right?
- No.
- Have a nice life.
- Thanks. You too.
The Today show is here, they're setting up. We're not ready! It's not working.
Richard, calm down! It's just the panic before the storm.
Corinne, Eleanor Roosevelt's wig is missing.
What?! It's got to be here.
I'm sure we'll find it.
- Mamie Eisenhower's hair might work.
- Wrong party. She's a Republican.
- Have you checked Maintenance?
- No. I'm on my way.
Oh! When you go by the Today show set, casually see what Willard
Scott has on his head.
- Excuse me. Corinne, telephone.
- I'm not here.
- It's your daughter.
- Oh! I'm here.
- Hello, honey!
- Hi Mom.
Where are you?
I'm on the New Jersey turnpike.
I'm running a little late.
I'll be home for dinner.
Great! Are you alone, or are you bringing the missing link with you?
Mom, we broke up months ago.
Well, I never thought he was right for you.
I know. OK. I have to go.
Be careful, sweetheart. Bye-bye.
- You were right! Maintenance had it.
- Great.
- And look what I found.
- What?
Jackie Kennedy's earrings!
They were with the dinosaur teeth.
Inventory got 'em mixed up when we switched buildings.
Corinne, you should have been a first lady.
I was, once.
Corinne, can I go?
Sure. I'll see you tomorrow morning at six.
Six? This is the opening of an exhibit, not... a dairy farm.
You're right. I'll see you at six thirty.
Six thirty.
- Good night, Joe. See you, John.
- Ms Jeffries.
Hi, handsome.
I'm having those dreams again.
The X-rated ones with Louie.
- Dr Bailey, you'd be shocked.
- What else? How have you been feeling?
Fantastic. It was Louie's birthday on Saturday.
I baked him a cake with little cherries in it.
I thought we agreed that you were going to stop cooking for Louie.
It was his birthday.
It makes me happy to feed him.
The Egyptians fed their dead.
Not after 23 years.
Now, when you first came to me you told me that you wanted to free yourself from your attachment to Louie.
That you wanted to move on, that you wanted to experience love again.
And we agreed that that meant a fruitful relationship with a man who has a body.
Now, can you do that much, Corinne?
Can you refrain from these activities that, uh perpetuate your fantasy?
I'll try.
Here's your favourite... Peppermint
Patty. Good night!
He raised a gull-like cry in the air.
Thar she blows!
Thar she blows!
A hump like a snow hill!
It is Moby Dick!
I liked it so much better.
From the day I said goodbye.
And I tell myself I'm free.
But I'm only fooling me.
Cos no matter what I do.
I can't get over you.
A Mr Alex Finch to see Mr Bradlee.
Mr Bradlee doesn't know who you are.
- I'm sure he would recognise me if...
- I'm sorry.
- May I help you?
- Can I... try him one...?
Goodbye.
Excuse me. I was wondering if Mr Bradlee...?
I have a delivery for Mr Bradlee.
Hi, there. Morning.
Oh, good. You're here.
Thanks.
Who the hell are you?
I met you at Yale, sir, where I went.
You gave a lecture and you told me to look you up when I got out.
I just got out yesterday, and here
I am! I want to be a reporter.
How'd you get up here?
The elevator, sir. I...
I came up...
With me. He came up with me.
It's my very good friend...
Alex Finch.
I... I was editor of the
Yale Daily News and.
I was a stringer for two years for Time and I can start tonight.
Now. Two hours ago.
He's very hot. He's... He could be our next Woodward and Bernstein.
Well, at least talk to him, Ben.
OK, Finch. Wait outside.
Right!
Thank you.
Mr Bradlee will see you now.
I'm sorry, Finch.
But did you read the one about the kitchen workers' strike?
If I hired you, the guys in this office would eat you for breakfast.
Believe me, you need experience. Contacts.
Find work on a small-town paper.
Then, when you've paid your dues, know your way around, gimme a call.
OK.
Thanks anyway.
Bradlee doesn't know everything.
- Hi. Philip Train.
- Hi.
Philip Train...
Pulitzer Prize, 1979.
Wow.
Listen, I'm about to get a cab.
Can I drop you anywhere?
I have a car.
I can give you a ride.
I'd be honoured. Sir.
I've lived in
Washington all my life.
With the exception of six months in Bolivia. I married a tin heiress.
Can't remember why.
She used to call me Peeleep.
Anyway, I just got out of mistake number two.
Why don't you turn left up here?
Sorry.
- What are you doing for dinner?
- Dinner?
You're coming with me. My friends live just down the street.
Coming?
Yeah.
Hello, hello, hello!
- Nobody home.
- God, this is a nice house!
Hi, Philip.
Hello, honey. Meet my friend,
- Alex...
- You!
- Miranda!
- Finch.
I don't believe this.
This is incredible.
Do you two know each other?
Someone should start dinner.
I'll do it.
- Get him a drink!
- Come in.
OK.
- What are you doing here?
- I came down to get a job at the Post.
- Well, how'd it go?
- Terribly.
But... things are... definitely picking up.
So I started today. I'm interning for this judge.
That's great.
- First in her class in law school.
- Philip...
Second.
Skipped high school entirely.
Skipped a year.
- I'm home!
- We're out here.
- Mom!
- Sweetheart!
Philip, that smells delicious!
Sorry I'm late, but we've been looking for Dolly Madison's arm.
- Poke holes in 'em, otherwise they explode.
- Sorry, Mom!
Mom? This is Alex Finch.
- Hi, Alex.
- Hi.
Have we met before?
- I don't... think so.
- He's staying for dinner. He's homeless.
Oh! Wonderful.
I'll go change and be right back.
- She's a curator at the Smithsonian.
- And your dad?
He died before I was born.
- Sorry.
- And Philip's my godfather.
He's your mother's boyfriend?
No! No.
Well, unfortunately, my mother never really got over my father.
Look at this. Come here.
That's my dad.
Miranda where's that corn?
So what kind of lawyer do you want to be?
A public defender.
Supreme Court justice!
I like to fight.
Oh, honey, you'd better get some more ice.
- I'll get it.
- Thanks.
Thanks, Alex.
- So what do you think?
- I like him.
Philip!
I think we'll call the tree George.
Now, aren't they beautiful?
That... that didn't happen.
That's right.
My bowl! What's that doing here?
"Corinne Randolph and Louis Jeffries, joined in holy matrimony, May 18th, 1963."
Do you Louis Jeffries take Corinne
Randolph to be your lawful wedded wife?
Shit!
What a coincidence.
That's a coincidence.
That's a coincidence.
Uncle Marsh!
Who the hell's Uncle Marsh?
Who is he?
"John Marshall Jeffries."
Oh, good.
- Alex?
- Hold on!
- Corn?
- Thank you.
Oh, honey, would you get the little silver corn holders?
What corn holders?
It's in the sideboard.
Second drawer on the right.
So they are!
Good guess.
So tell me, Alex, what does your father do?
Al-ex!
Oh, he runs a dry-cleaning establishment.
It's called Finch's Easy-Clean.
And he specialises mostly in goose down and suede and, you know, fine fabrics, but he's thinking about expanding into fur storage.
I said, "Dad, that's not a good idea", because you don't have... the...
"experience."
Come on Louie!
OK
Alex?
Peekaboo!
Easy on the vino, pal!
Is everything all right?
Excuse me.
Louie!
Oh, my God.
I'm Louie Jeffries!
I was Louie Jeffries!
That means that that lady's my wife.
And Miranda... oh,
God, I kissed her!
And Philip... my best friend.
Philip...
- Yeah?
- Everything OK in there?
Yes.
Philip. It's great to see you again!
It's... great to see you.
Excuse me.
Well...! I hope it wasn't my cooking.
Car keys, maps,
Corinne's sunglasses, and light bulbs.
It's my car.
It's my car.
- Great! It's my car.
- Alex!
Alex?
My deodorant. There's my mouthwash.
There's my books...
It's mine. It's all mine.
Whoa! Come on. It's all right.
Come down.
Watch your step, we're going up.
That's it...
Honey, do you really think it's safe for him to stay here?
All those things he was saying, all that running around!
He's had a rough day. He's just a little stressed.
Trust me.
OK. But make sure your bedroom door is locked.
Towels.
Are you sure that it's all right, me staying here the night?
You're welcome to stay as long as you like.
I'm sorry I ruined the dinner party.
You didn't mess it up.
You brought it to life.
Miranda...
Yeah?
Have you had a happy life?
Yeah. I guess so.
Is there anything you wanted that you haven't had?
My father.
He was a pretty great guy, huh?
That's what they tell me.
God, you sure have grown up nicely!
I'm glad you approve.
Good night!
Night.
Hi. I love the suit!
You shouldn't have.
- I wanted to. Your first power suit!
- Mom...!
Don't let Alex go anywhere.
I'll lock him in the tower with the other boyfriends who are trying to get away!
Love you.
- Morning.
- I didn't think anyone was home. I'm sor...
Well, I'm running a little late.
- How are you feelin'?
- I'm not quite myself, but I'm OK.
I, uh... I've... I've...
Yes?
I, uh...
I love orange juice!
I'm so glad.
I, uh... I... I bet your husband was a real orange juice man.
Yes, he was. He was generally fond of fruit.
- Excuse me!
- He was handsome and witty too, I understand.
I mean, I... a man of high ideals.
Yes. He was all those things.
Oh, uh... Miranda left these for you.
You should help yourself to anything to eat, and make yourself at home.
OK.
Excuse me.
Dreaming of Louie every night this week.
My psychiatrist says I suffer from the halo effect
the tendency of widows to idealise their dead husbands.
He says it keeps me from falling in love again.
He has a point but I can't imagine
I'll ever stop loving Louie.
Cor-anda!
Corinne, you're never gonna believe this, but...
Miranda, this may come as a shock to you, but...
- Morning.
- Morning.
- I'm here to see Mrs Jeffries.
- She's in a meeting. Are you the caterer?
No. I'm... an old friend.
Oh. Just have a seat.
She won't be long.
Thanks.
Corinne I've developed the fine art of reading between the lips
and I see nothing but budget cuts on the horizon.
No-one is happy about it.
They won't bend the rules this time my dear Not even for you.
It is eight hours before the opening and you're telling me they want to fire me?
Corinne, we are two million dollars in the hole.
And it was you who insisted... and I quote...
"The American people maintain an insatiable curiosity" about that eclectic group of women who fashioned everything from foreign policy to hemlines at home.
I still believe that.
We still have to pay back the emergency fund so another department can have an emergency.
- I know that!
- By Friday.
Friday? But it's Wednesday.
That's impossible!
Now look, you remember that friend of mine who I hate, Mavis Talmadge?
- Yes...
- Well, tonight at the opening,
I want you to put the squeeze on old Mavis.
Why can't you?
Mavis Talmadge is not someone
I'd care to squeeze.
No-one in Washington is as rich as Mavis.
She's her own corporation, her own... landmass.
Now, Corinne, Mavis
Talmadge is the way to go.
I don't want to bother her and I don't feel well, so I'll just come back some other time.
Alex!
Hi.
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?
I wish you'd told me you were coming.
I could have arranged for a private tour.
Come on in.
This is gonna sound a little funny, but
I didn't come to see the museum.
I came here to see you.
I hope you didn't come all the way down here to apologise about last night.
No, I came to talk about something else.
I'm Louie.
What?
I'm not gonna beat around the bush.
You're not gonna believe me, but there's something you should know.
All right.
Our rainforests are being destroyed at a rate of 50 acres a minute!
Alex, do you want to borrow money?
Is this about Miranda?
In part.
Alex, I'm really sorry, but I have a lunch date in a few minutes.
Look into my eyes.
Does anything seem familiar?
- I beg your pardon?
- It's me.
Louie.
I'm back.
I wasn't drunk last night at dinner, and when I saw you and I saw the house, my memory came back of my last life.
- What are you talking about?
- With you!
I got my memory back and
I realised... that I was Louie.
I am Louie!
I got recycled.
You look great, by the way.
Hey, I know it's hard to believe.
I mean, I... can't...
Try to see.
Get out of my office.
Corinne...
Get out.
- Hi, Alex.
- Hi.
- How are you? Feeling better?
- Yeah. Can we sit down and...?
- I talked to Bradlee this afternoon.
- Yeah?
About you.
Bottom line is, he won't hire a rookie.
- But I've got some friends, editors.
- Philip, why are you going out of your way for me? I mean, you hardly know me.
I don't know.
Maybe it's like... with someone special...
You know that feeling that you have like a confidant, or maybe, you know, a best friend?
You want a beer?
Sure.
Miranda's left molar.
That's my Miranda file.
It's beautiful.
You really do like her, dontcha?
You look like a family.
Well, we are, almost.
Just without, uh... some of the usual conventions of marriage... sex.
So, uh... you and Mrs Jeffries have never been together?
- No.
- But you love her.
Hopelessly.
And all these years you've never touched her and you've never told her?
You don't know Corinne... she's wired differently. She's not like other women.
The slightest push in the wrong direction might...
I don't want to rush her.
I think you've done the right thing.
Well, I've tried to take care of Miranda and
Corinne the way I imagine Louie would've.
That's Louie. With the skinny legs.
Not that skinny.
Philip. You're not gonna believe this, but...
Um, sorry. Excuse me.
Hello? Oh, hi.
Research.
I'd better go.
Thanks.
Oh, my God.
This your first time as a human?
What?
I'm getting a strong
German shepherd vibration.
Uh... I used to be a lawyer.
Oh. Close!
Do you know about past lives?
We're all connected... it's all connected. Under the skin.
You never know who's lurking in what body.
Your wife could be your grandfather.
You meet some guy who gets on your nerves, it's probably your mother-in-law!
We keep meeting the souls we're attached to, for better or worse, life after life.
Sometimes I wonder why I worry about past lives at all.
I'm having so much trouble with this one!
When you remember your past lives, it's like your emotions get spread, like a dangling nerve, all over the map.
It makes it very hard to live.
I know.
Who were you?
Oh, me? I was no-one special.
Oh, we're all special.
I mean, I wasn't Cleopatra or
Hannibal or someone great or famous.
Well, I know you weren't Cleopatra.
I was!
I don't want him in this house!
Mom, you don't make any sense. Why all of a sudden does he have to leave?
I have my reasons.
End of conversation.
What do you mean, "end of conversation"?
What's he done?
He's... weird.
Mom, weirdness is not a criminal offence.
If it were, you'd be serving a life sentence!
Miranda, we don't know a thing about him. He's a stray off the street.
- He could be a...
- Yale grad!
Look, once again I like someone of whom you don't approve, for your own peculiar and inexplicable reasons.
So you order him out like some
Latin American generalissimo.
Where's my life in all this?
I'm sick and tired of trying to find someone who fits into your notion of Mr Right! He's not Daddy.
Nobody is.
He's leaving and that's final. Now, you go right downstairs and tell him!
You tell him.
All right...
I will!
Alex...
- Alex!
- Mom...
You look fabulous in Daddy's tux.
I'll get the car, Mom.
Oh, the first ladies were so fascinating as individuals!
Lou Hoover was a shot put champion, a geology major at Stanford and an accomplished linguist.
She and Herbert used to converse in Chinese.
This is Lady Bird.
Southern Democrats were furious with
LBJ for his stand on civil rights, so he sent his wife down
South to campaign for him, knowing that no southern gentleman could refuse to greet a southern lady... and it worked!
Fascinatin'.
Something the matter?
No! Eleanor Roosevelt is my favourite first lady.
She wore this gown the night of the president's inauguration.
There was a concert at Constitution Hall!
We want the people to know that the first ladies were more than just their china and their dresses.
Oh, thank you!
Aren't you going to introduce us?
Mrs Talmadge, this is Alex Finch, a friend of my daughter's.
Mr Finch.
- Oh!
- May I have this dance?
Here.
- May I have this dance?
- Philip...!
Where are we going?
I take it it's something urgent and top-secret?
- It's very important for me.
- Right!
Do you think it's possible... for Louie to come back?
Oh, Corinne! We're not going to go to another seance.
No, no! I mean, in another person's body.
I have no idea. But somehow I don't think so.
- Why are we discussing this now?
- It's a very interesting question.
Well, let's ask
Mrs Lincoln. Mary...
- Philip, I'm serious!
- Well, so am I.
Corinne, I can understand how a person's desires might lead her to believe that.
It would be a dream come true.
But the last guy to come back that
I know about was Jesus Christ.
You'll see Louie some day.
I know. In heaven.
Philip!
Why don't you find yourself a girlfriend?
You're so good-looking.
So we're in agreement,
Miss Talmadge?
- Mavis.
- Mavis.
That America's first ladies deserve a place in history as much as some of the dopes they married.
Sure, they had the official power.
But the real power lies behind the scenes. With women. Like you.
Two million dollars will save this exhibit, and the whole world will discover America's first ladies in the all-new Mavis
Talmadge Pavilion!
An excellent choice and happy anniversary!
There you are! Dance with me.
- Oh, no. I'm a lousy dancer.
- No, you've just never had the right partner.
- Where did you learn to dance like that?
- Inherited it from my dad.
They're supposed to be down.
Now you're mine!
Mavis!
My goodness!
Mrs Talmadge?
- Is there a doctor in the ballroom?
- Alex!
Still ticking.
Move back, everyone, please! Get back!
Mrs Talmadge? Oh, my God!
- What happened?
- I don't know.
- I hope she's all right.
- Oh, she's fine. She's got a strong spirit.
What are you talking about?
I mean, she's practically dead.
Oh, but that's just her body.
Which, let's face it, is no big loss.
- In the long run...
- What are you talking about?
She'll come back. People do, again and again.
For instance, I could have been someone you knew before.
- Yeah.
- Someone that... you loved.
Let's go.
I could have been your... father.
- I have to talk to you.
- Get... get... get off me!
Only if you promise to listen to what I have to say!
Don't break that! It was Father's.
No! No! I'll... Good night, good night.
You win. Good night.
Just relax. I'll leave.
I'm sorry, but this is important.
I had a pair of diamond earrings with me the day I died.
They were for you.
For our anniversary.
How do you know about those?
I bought 'em from Mr Zellerbach!
How do you think I know?
I know everything about you, darling.
I know that you love peanut butter and rhubarb.
You're a psychic or one of those kooks. A spoon-bender!
- No. You love Johnny Mathis!
- Get out of here, before I scream so loud the whole neighbourhood shows up and I have you arrested for impersonating a person!
And I know you did the Watusi before Lucy Baines, remember?
Remember this?
Good night.
Oh. I forgot.
This is for you.
Louie?
Louie!
Are you OK?
Corinne!
Corinne!
- What's the matter?
- Down here.
OK. What?
I haven't done it in 23 years.
Wha...?!
That's... that, that's... it's OK.
It's like riding a bike. You never...
You never... forget.
You know... Don't worry. Corinne!
Baby, can you please... open this door?
Because I'm really... uh...
Oh, God...
Good night.
Good night.
Oh, damn!
- Hiya, darling.
- Shhh! Mom's next door.
- What are you doing here?
- What does it look like I'm doing?
Miranda...
- What?
- It's way past your bedtime.
- Go to your room!
- What is wrong with you?
Is it me?
No, it's not you. I mean, yes, it's you, but it's not you you.
- Look, if you're not interested...
- I am interested. I'm very interested.
It's not that I'm not interested. It's...
Well, is there someone else?
- Huh?
- Yeah.
God!
Just... pretend this didn't happen.
OK.
God!
Louie!
Good morning!
Morning.
I thought we could have a picnic today in the Mall. Maybe... take in the Lincoln Memorial.
Maybe, uh...
I can't. I mean,
I have to work tomorrow.
And I have this trial to sit in on, and I just don't have time.
It'd be fun.
Sorry.
Well, maybe some other time.
- Maybe... yeah.
- Maybe.
Thanks for thinking of me.
Dr Bailey,
I came here to tell you that
I'm interested in someone.
A man.
Well, he's almost a man.
What do you mean?
He's only 22 years old.
But it's not like I'm rushing into anything. I've known him for 26 years!
Corinne...
It's a little complicated.
Uh, is this someone that you've told me about before?
No.
We only met three days ago.
But you just said that you've known him 26 years.
He used to be a different person.
Uh... he's changed a lot.
Dr Bailey,
I don't know if it's just his body
I'm attracted to or his soul, or if it's just... me.
I'm feeling generally attractive.
The truth is,
I'm so ripe, I'm about to fall off the vine!
Well, I-I-I feel this is a very positive step. Uh...
Now, I sense some hesitation in entering into a relationship with a younger man, but this is perfectly natural.
Society inhibits us, but feelings are feelings and you are crossing a very important threshold.
May the good Lord be with you down every road you roam.
And may sunshine and happiness surround you when you're far from home.
And may you grow to be proud dignified and true.
And do unto others as you would have done to you.
Be courageous and be brave.
And in my heart you'll always stay.
Forever young.
Forever young.
We used to love to come here, you and I.
Louie and I.
Do you remember?
No.
What do you remember?
Uh... it's kind of like a dream coming back, bits and pieces.
But I especially remember people that I really love, like you and Philip.
Thanks.
Come on!
- There you go.
- Thanks. How much?
That's all right, ma'am.
Your son already paid.
- What was Miranda like at ten?
- At ten? Precocious.
Opinionated. Fiercely independent.
She got braces then, which she removed with pliers after wearing them for about an hour!
I remember Philip telling her, "All great beauties must suffer and sacrifice!"
You...!
Hi!
I want to have at least... two more.
Babies?!
It's not too late, is it?
No...
Can we start... tonight?
Are you sure?
I asked him is there anybody else, and he said yes.
To me, that's pretty compelling evidence.
- He admired your molar.
- What?
Yesterday at my house. Your X-rays.
You know, one minute he's there with you and the next minute...
And I think I'm in love with him.
I know it sounds ridiculous.
I've only known him a few days, but I mean, I've never felt this way for anybody before.
I mean, if he asked me to marry him I'd say yes.
The weird thing is, he treats me like I'm five, like I'm his daughter or something.
Well, don't give up.
These things take time.
Believe me!
- Philip...
- What?
Why don't you just attack Mom once and for all and get it over with?
That you?
What's he doing here?
Philip! What are you doing?
Hi!
Creating the most spectacular veal parmigiane!
Soon.
I'm gonna go upstairs and take a cold shower.
Uh, Miranda called. She's gonna be working late.
- Can I help?
- No.
God, you look beautiful!
Philip, you got a haircut!
- What's the occasion?
- You.
Oh, Philip!
Oh, God!
Oh, the gorilla!
Tell him about the time you were a gorilla at Miranda's birthday party.
And scared them all practically to death!
I think we'll spare him that one.
How am I doing?
- More champagne, cherie?
- Mais oui
Philip, you've outdone yourself!
This is one of the greatest meals I've ever had.
Thank you, Alex.
I'll drink to that!
You must be exhausted.
You certainly look exhausted.
You look out of it. I wish you didn't have to go.
Me too!
Thanks for everything.
We'll see you. Feel better!
Sometimes we walk hand in hand by the sea.
And we breathe in the cool salty air.
You turn to me with a kiss in your eyes.
And my heart feels a thrill beyond compare.
Then your lips cling to mine.
It's wonderful wonderful.
Oh so wonderful my love.
My dessert! My peach cobbler!
Sometimes we stand on the top of a hill.
And we gaze at the earth and the sky.
I turn to you and you melt in my arms.
Here we are darling only you and I.
What a moment to share.
It's wonderful wonderful.
Thanks!
Oh so wonderful my love.
- Philip!
- It's not what you think!
That's good!
You smarmy little bastard!
Philip, no! Philip...!
Philip!
This is not what you think!
It's something else entirely!
Alex is Louie. Reincarnated.
I didn't believe it either at first.
- Oh, Philip, isn't it a miracle?
- He told you that?
- Pass yourself off as her dead husband?
- No!
Very cute!
No!
Philip!
- Stop it!
- Get off!
- No!
- I am Louie!
It's true! It's me!
He can prove it. Go on, honey!
Oh, spare me "honey". Corinne...
He's got you figured out.
All he wants is your money.
You're wrong. He wants my body!
- I'm Louie!
- Yeah, and I'm Cleopatra!
- You're not.
- Stop it!
You fight like her, though!
Stop it, stop it!
Listen! Listen, you stubborn son of a bitch!
The day Corinne and I got married, at the altar, you told me you were in love with her.
- What are you, CIA?
- Do you deny it?
No.
Philip...
Oh, Philip!
Now, look, I'm just a dumb newspaperman.
I believe Monday follows Sunday,
I believe that summer follows spring.
I believe in God and glasnost
I believe in things you can touch.
In my whole life,
I have never met a more devious or clever scoundrel.
Now get out of here before I throw you out!
Philip!
Philip! Philip!
What did you do that for?!
He was trying to kill me!
He's twice your age and in his heart attack years.
- You could have killed him!
- He's just passed out.
How could you?!
Whose side are you on, anyway?
Yours! But I could never have made it through the last 23 years without Philip.
- He's sleeping like a baby. Can't we...?
- No!
I am old enough to be your mother.
Now go to your room, Alex!
Go to my room.
Oh, Philip!
Dear Philip!
If anything ever happened to you, I...
I must have been out of my mind.
Forgive me my darling.
I'll be there at midnight.
Come on, Sleeping Beauty.
Oh, God! Oh...
Shoes off...
Wha...?
Oh, Louie!
"Louie"?
Philip?! What are you doing here?
I'm not sure.
- Whatever just happened was...
- A miracle.
We almost... We could have...
- We still can.
- I have to go!
- Good night.
- No! No, I'm not gonna let you go.
What are you doing?
I'm finding out once and for all what it feels like to hold the woman I love, have always loved, and will always love, till the day I die.
I love you, Corinne.
Why didn't you ever tell me?
- How could I?
- All these years,
Louie was always there with us.
Every moment.
In your heart.
In my heart.
In the air.
But I don't feel him here now.
No.
Mother?
Miranda?
Miranda...!
- Morning.
- I don't believe this!
This is amazing! This is wonderful.
I have to go.
I want details.
Congratulations!
What happened to Alex?
Miranda! Psst!
Miranda!
Hi.
All rise!
This court is now in session, the Honourable Judge
Harrison Fenwick presiding.
Morning.
Please be seated.
- The clerk will call the case.
- Your Honour, the case of the United States versus Lawrence Garber.
Without that evidence the counts against
Tony Bonino are out the window.
Bonino is one of the most cunning and powerful individuals in organised crime.
- Request permission to approach.
- Alex...!
I know about you and
Anthony Bonino.
It's all right.
Step aside.
So, still on the take?
Young man, I don't know who you are or what you want, but you're making a grave mistake.
Now, I suggest that you turn around and walk out of here without saying another word, or you're going to find yourself in big trouble.
I worshipped you, you son of a bitch. You let Bonino walk!
Marshall, step him back!
He suppressed evidence against Tony Bonino, and...
Oh, my God!
..it would have put him behind bars for life! It was May 18th of 1964.
- It is Louie, isn't it?
- And, and... shit!
- Roosevelt Island!
- Roosevelt Island!
My camera! The day I died!
The court recesses until 1 o'clock!
- The camera. Get the camera, Corinne!
- Let him go!
Alex!
Alex...!
Oh, God!
It's not that I don't love you.
I do. I always will.
But... people change.
Not as much as you, generally, but we've both changed.
You're just not my husband any more.
Last night I found out something about myself that I never would have known if it... wasn't for you.
That I love Philip.
And I only hope with my whole heart that some day you'll forgive me.
Forgive us.
Oh, darling, can you hear anything I'm saying?
Excuse me, ma'am.
It's time for his injection.
Just a little something you should have had a long time ago.
I feel better now!
Where the hell am I?
In the hospital. With us.
Do you know who I am?
You're Mrs Jeffries.
You're Miranda's mother.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Hey, pal.
You gave us quite a scare.
How's your head?
Still on. I think.
Miranda!
Hi.
You don't remember any of it?
No.
The last thing I remember is Philip inviting me to your house for dinner.
And you and I... getting the corn out of the refrigerator.
Then it gets a little foggy after that, but
I think it was something like this.
Alex... what about that other girl you're seeing?
What other girl?
So, Finch, where did you get that picture?
I can't reveal my source, Mr Bradlee.
I mean, I really can't.
You're a tough nut to crack, Finch.
You're gonna make one hell of a reporter.
You start Monday.
You look so beautiful.
OK, it's time.
Come on. Philip's waited long enough!
- Mrs Jeffries?
- Yes, Alex?
I'm gonna go get the bouquets.
I just want to say congratulations.
You and Philip make a great pair!
Thanks, Alex.
You know, you're the first boyfriend of Miranda's
I ever really liked!
Philip?
- Yeah?
- I have something I have to tell you.
Now?
I'm in love with Miranda.
I know.
Well, here we are again.
I guess it must be fate.
We've tried it on our own.
But deep inside we've known.
We'd be back to set things straight.
I still remember when.
Your kiss was so brand-new.
Every memory repeats.
Every step I take retreats.
Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of God to witness and bless the joining together.
After all the stops and starts.
We keep coming back to these two hearts.
Two angels who've been rescued from the fog.
And after all that we've been through.
It all comes down to me and you.
And this is meant to be.
Forever you and me.
After all.
When love is truly right.
This time it's truly right.
It lives from year to year.
It changes as it goes.
On and on away it grows.
But it never disappears.
After all the stops and starts.
We keep coming back to these two hearts.
Two angels who've been rescued from the fog.
And after all that we've been through.
It all comes down to me and you.
I guess it's meant to be.
Forever you and me.
After all.
Always just beyond my touch.
Though I needed you so much.
After all what else is living for?
Whoa, after all the stops and starts.
We keep coming back to these two hearts.
Two angels who've been rescued from the fog.
And after all that we've been through.
It all comes down to me and you.
I guess it's meant to be.
Forever you and me.
After all the stops and starts.
We keep coming back to these two hearts.
Two angels who've been rescued from the fog.
And after all that we've been through.
It all comes down to me and you.
I guess it's meant to be.
Forever you and me.
After all
It's my special recipe!
We're not gonna make it!
You realise how late we... Oh!
I told you, you're gonna break those!
Oh, wow! Wait! Santa Claus, come quick! Look!
Incoming!
Take cover!
Let's get 'em!
Come on, over here! Hurry up! Hurry!
It's Lee Majors!
The Six Million Dollar Man!
- Is there a back exit?
- Of course.
But this Santa's going out the front.
I don't matter, but the world can't afford to lose you. Stay put!
That's very nice of you, Lee.
And Lee, you've been a real good boy this year!
Yes, you sure have.
Seven o'clock.
Psychos seize Santa's Workshop.
Eat this!
Only Lee Majors can stop them.
8:30, and America's best-Ioved singer invites you to share a home-style holiday.
Ring-a-ling...
Nine o'clock, IBC presents
America's favourite family in a special Christmas episode.
Hi, Mom, isn't Dad home yet?
Well, Wally,
I expect he's out chasing beaver.
Show me the "Scrooge" promo.
It was a cold, bleak, Christmas...
10 o'clock, IBC present live, via satellite from New York,
Bethlehem, Helsinki, West Berlin and the Great Barrier Reef,
Charles Dickens' immortal Christmas classic. starring Buddy Hackett,
Jamie Farr, the Solid Gold Dancers and Mary-Lou Retton as Tiny Tim.
- Hosted by Sir John Houseman...
- Bah! Humbug!
It will touch every heartstring.
It all starts on Christmas Eve -
Christmas Eve on IBC.
Oh, my gosh... Does THAT suck?!
Y-you know who loves
Mary-Lou Retton, Frank? My kids.
- Yeah.
- Children love an acrobat.
Oh...
We have spent 40 million on a live TV show, you guys have got an ad with
America's favourite old fart... reading a book in front of a fireplace!
Now... I have to kill all of you.
Mother, help me!
Excuse me, sir, uh... but we've been running that spot now for over a month and... well, it's getting a hell of a response.
I am the youngest president in the history of television for a reason.
I know the people.
Well, uh, granted, but the people already wanna watch the show.
That isn't good enough!
They have got to be so scared to miss it, so terrified!
Now, if I were in charge, and I AM...
Perhaps I can help you.
Here's what I'd do. Grace, cue it up.
Acid rain.
Drug addiction.
International terrorism.
Freeway killers.
Now, more than ever...
...we must remember the true meaning of Christmas.
Don't miss Charles Dickens' immortal classic, "Scrooge",
Your life might just depend on it.
Not bad, huh?
I think they'll like it in the heartlands.
I want it every hour on the hour.
I'll take care of it.
Get me Standards and Practices,
I wanna see Reece.
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes...?
Mr Cross, what exactly does that ad have to do with "Scrooge"?
Nothing. Why?
You can't show that commercial.
If you run that... you're gonna frighten people.
- You think I'm off base?
- Yes!
Well... a tad, sir.
Um, that looked like the Manson Family Christmas Special.
Well, it's a little late for this kind of feedback.
That's because it's the first time
I've seen it, sir.
You're right, I... sprung it on you.
It's not that bad, just lose, like, you know, the gun and the blood...
- All right...
- And the guy shooting up...
I'll tell you in five minutes.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank YOU.
You know,
I think we're a little bit alike.
Sir? Merry Christmas.
- Thanks for the talk.
- Thank you.
We don't wanna scare the Dickens out of people.
The "Dickens" out of people.
Nobody gets me.
Grace, who is that guy?
- Eliot, Loudermilk.
- OK.
Have security clear his desk and toss him out.
Oh, he's fired?
- But it's Christmas.
- Thank you!
Call Accounting, stop his bonus.
- A clear shot at his back.
- Eliot Loudermilk...
Code Nine.
Grace, what in the hell is this?
That's a painting one of my kids did.
There's Santa Claus and Mrs Claus.
How many fingers does Mrs Claus have?
Right, it's crap,
I don't want it here.
She'll understand, she's an amazingly understanding woman.
I'll just say, "Hi, honey, we have to move to a studio apartment."
Mr Cross, it's time for your Christmas list.
OK, let's get this over with.
- Sammy Goldberg.
- Bath towel.
- Lou Parker
- VHS home video recorder.
Colonel Tom Parker.
The bath towel.
- Tamara Forristal.
- VHS.
It's great taking a bus to work, you know?
Oh, hi, fellas.
Thanks a lot. Merry Christmas.
- Babalu Towloudes.
- The bath towel.
Eliot Loudermilk's leaving early today.
Get outta here!
Dah! Four minutes and 40 seconds.
Glenn Glenn Whitacre.
What was the last rating on "Police Zoo"?
5.2 Nielsen and a 70 share.
- Towel.
- Your brother?
- Towel.
- Your only brother.
Oh, God, give it to me!
Get that.
- Towel, towel...
- Mr Cross's office.
- Towel...
- Thank you.
Most of these are towels, OK?
Mr Rhinelander's on his way down.
Booze.
Pardon me.
Oh, excuse me.
Grace?
- Get yourself a towel.
- And my bonus?
- Towel and a face cloth.
- Oh, shi...
- Frank?
- Hey, Pres.
- What a surprise.
- Grace.
You look great.
Have you been working out?
Preston, just looking at some of this ink we're getting on Scrooge.
You believe the first director didn't want her? He does now.
Did you catch Tiny Tim?
She doesn't throw away the crutches.
She throws away the crutches, vaults a lamp-post
- And double somersaults into this.
- Frank.
Killer. Yes, Preston?
Do you know how many cats there are in this country?
N-N... no, mmm... I don't have... no.
27 million. D'you know how many dogs?
- In America?
- 48 million.
We spend 4 billion on pet food alone.
Four...?!
I have a study which shows that cats and dogs are beginning to watch television.
If these scientists are right, we should start programming right now.
Within 20 years, they could become steady viewers.
Programming... for cats?
Walk with me, Frank.
Call the police.
I'm not saying build a whole show around animals.
All I'm suggesting is we occasionally throw in a little pet appeal.
- Some birds, a squirrel...
- Mice.
Mice, exactly.
You remember Kojak and the lollipops?
What about a cop that dangles string, that's his gimmick.
Lots of quick random action.
Frank, wasn't there a dormouse in "Scrooge"?
No, but I always felt that it needed a dormouse.
- Dormice, better.
- Bingo!
Frank, this show is the jewel in the IBC crown.
Everything is riding on it.
Don't worry, I'm overseeing every aspect of production.
- We'll own Christmas.
- That's what I want to hear.
- Lunch tomorrow?
- Right.
Up, Sid. Study this.
Oh, thank you.
God...
If only I could fire that poor sonofabitch.
...going down. Hey, Frank! Hold that door, will you, Pops? Wait for me.
Brice Cummings, we met at Spago.
Have you seen Preston?
Uh, Preston just went back upstairs.
I went to school with his son.
Give me a call, OK?
Let's go. So, anyway, Coselle says...
Come here! Slam these doors-hard!
Grace, I need a full report on a guy named Brice Cummings.
He's an LA slimeball.
OK, you're due at Helmsley Palace at seven and I'm leaving.
- No, we're working late.
- My son's seeing the doctor.
- You're working late!
- I made the appointment months ago.
I care(!)
If I'm working late, you've gotta work late!
If you can't work late,
I can't work late!
If I can't work late...
I can't work late!
Oh, your brother's waiting inside.
And I didn't tell him about his great Christmas towel.
Francis, a little rough on her out there, weren't you?
You know what they say about treating people badly coming up.
Yeah, you can treat 'em badly going down, too.
It's great, two chances to rough 'em up.
Why don't the cops do something about this? Excuse me, please.
D'you learn that song yesterday?
Sweet.
Frank, you don't like Christmas, do you?
I love it! It's cold and people stay home and watch TV.
These idiots are gonna be at home watching TV for me tonight.
I'm a big fan of Christmas.
So any chance of you making Christmas dinner...?
- None.
- Come on...
- Don't start.
- The family'll be there.
It'll be fun.
You have your wonderful dinner with your cool friends, and the popcorn and tree and cranberries, and send Christmas cards on recycled paper.
It's a crock, James. It's for kids.
You know, I like seeing you.
I like being with you...
Have a happy New Year.
Merry Christmas.
Taxi!
Excuse me, ma'am, I think you dropped something there.
That's my cab! Oh, sir, please, I...
You sonofabitch, you can burn in hell!
Bye bye, Grandma! Bye bye.
I got into broadcasting because I like to give.
Sometimes I found myself hurting from giving too much, and I'd say "Stop it".
I'm always gonna cherish this.
And all of you.
I should've went in there.
I should've said "Frank Cross..."
You stinking guy! You big dog, you!
Here's five.
Mr Cross.
Wasn't he a medical genius?
Calvin, I think doctor is a Latin word for thief.
200 I don't have to tell me you don't speak.
I'm your mother,
I know you don't speak. Yet.
We'll show 'em, honey. You gonna surprise a lot of people.
Yes, you are!
You start talking, then go to law school and sue his butt off.
Come!
Who's there?
This office is closed!
This whole wing is closed!
Grace!
Grace!
That was a good one.
How are you, kid? You... Ah...
Will you excuse me?
I'll make myself a little drink.
I don't mind you hitting me,
Frank, but mind the Bacardi.
To old times, my friend.
Oh, my God, it's...
Lew Hayward, your old boss.
Your best friend.
But you're...
- Dead.
- Seven years.
Has it been that long?
To look at you I wouldn't have guessed more than three, tops.
Oh, Frank. Frank, you are in trouble.
Big trouble.
All right, let's say for argument's sake that that I am in big trouble.
- What would that mean?
- Look at me.
Now, if you don't change your ways you'll wind up doomed, just as I am.
One minute, I'm on the 14th hole at Wingfoot, lining up a putt.
A heart attack later,
I'm a worm feast.
No, no, no, no, no, no, you're not a worm feast, you're an hallucination brought on by alcohol,
Russian vodka poisoned by Chernobyl.
I've been under a lot of pressure lately...
- SILENCE!
- Ouch.
I had it all.
I was a captain of industry.
Feared by men. Adored by women.
Adored?!
Let's be honest, Lew.
You paid for the women.
- Don't waste your life as I did.
- Waste?!
You're a legend in this business - you invented the mini-series.
Mankind should have been my business.
Charity, mercy, kindness - that should've been my business.
Don't wait. Get yourself involved.
It's too late for me, but not for you.
You are going to be visited by three ghosts.
- THREE ghosts?
- Three ghosts, Frank.
Expect the first one tomorrow at noon.
Tomorrow's bad for me, Lew, and the rest of the week's a wash-out. Ouch!
Maybe we could have drinks, say Thursday?
This is no joke, Frank!
- This is your last chance!
- All right, we'll do breakfast.
Oh, no, please.
They'll think I'm a suicide.
Whoa! Oh, come on!
Gimme a break! Aagh!
- You can be saved.
- Don't let go! God bless you!
NO! NO, please!
Merry Christmas.
Hi, this is Claire Phillips.
I'm not here, as usual.
Leave a message and I'll call you back. Ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas.
Claire!
This is Frank...
Cross.
I know it's been...
15 years since we talked, but... but I really need to talk to you right now.
Something terrible's happened.
Or maybe not, I don't know. But I...
I have to talk to you. It's urgent!
Call me at any hour.
My number is 67 4-95-65... 67 4...
Damn!
- Well?
- Well, what?
Did you get the bonus?
I'm drying my head with it.
We'll be OK.
What are you doing in there?
Trimming the tree.
- We don't have a tree, Mom.
- We do now.
- NO!
- Yes!
- Don't plug him in!
- Plug him in.
Take it off. Take it off him.
Oh, but Mom, he looks so pretty.
He's so cute!
- When are we gonna get a real tree?
- When they're free.
- Have you seen the paper, Frank?
- Ooh, she's pretty!
She's dead, Frank!
This 80-year-old grandmother was watching your "Scrooge" promo and she keeled over.
It scared her to death.
This is terrific!!
I knew that ad worked!
You can't buy publicity like this!
Excuse me.
Mr Cross, you're needed on the set.
Run that promo EVERY half hour!
I want a disclaimer. "Anyone with a heart condition MUST not watch."
- Where were we?
- I was being haunted.
No, it's got to be REAL gold.
I don't understand why I can't get anybody to do what I want.
Gimme a break.
I will not allow this costume on the air.
- Why not?
- Because you can see her nipples.
I WANT to see her nipples!
This is a Christmas show!
Charles Dickens would want to see her nipples.
I can't hardly see them nipples.
And these guys are REALLY looking.
You can go shake a tail-feather.
And you, just go!
Watch out!
Thanks, boys. Get the nurse.
Get the nurse!
Make sure her nipples are covered up.
Lumpy!
Lumpy!
Hi.
I'm sorry to just...
I only got your message this morning.
I called, but you weren't in yet.
I called again, but you were busy. So I...
- God, you look different.
- Well, it's been a while.
It's your hair.
It's so short.
You look sort of grown up.
Yo, Frank!
I mean, Mr Cross. Check it out. The girls are tough. It's on the money.
Would you excuse me for a moment?
Ha!
Can I turn her head?
- No.
- OK. That works, see?
H'up and bum.
A little bootie here for ya.
See?
You just had to see it in context.
Will you move her, please? Thanks.
Allez-oop!
- Will she be OK?
- Yeah, she's a real pro.
What about you?
You sounded like you'd seen a ghost.
A ghost?
You mean the phone call last night.
I found your number and
I had to call you, immediately.
I know that voice.
That was the frightened Lumpy.
- Excuse me, Lumpy.
- Most people call me Mr Cross!
Sorry, I got a problem.
- I bet. What?
- This little fella.
I can't get the antlers glued onto this little guy.
- Try staples.
- Staples?!
Don't you dare! If you staple that mouse, I'll call the Humane Society.
- I'd never hurt this little fella.
- Marlin, Perkins. The road.
- I have three dogs.
- Go tell Reader's Digest!
Staples!
Same old Claire.
Still trying to save the world.
You still trying to run it?
- GET OUTTA HERE!
- YOU called me.
Who are you?
You little worm! Who are you?
How'd you get in here? Maybe you'll answer some questions downtown, huh?
What is going on?!
- This is my boy.
- OK. YOU beat him.
Does he work here?
No! I thought it'd be fun for him to see a live TV show.
D'you see anybody having fun?
Why are you so angry?
Why haven't
YOU ever learnt to button a coat?
You know me, I just like...
I was in a hurry.
I'm sorry to have called so late last night.
- Did I wake your husband and kids?
- No, no. I've never gotten married.
You?
Er, no.
- Never?
- No.
Would you hold the goddamned hammering, please!
- I'd better go.
- NO! Don't go.
Would you HOLD THE GODDAMNED
HAMMERING, PLEASE!!
Frank, what did happen last night?
Claire, it was something that I ate.
Probably a bad clam or something.
Well, if it happens again... gimme a call here.
I'm hardly ever home.
I'm definitely gonna call.
I'm a seafood nut and to not eat clams-what's life for?
Would ya please... for the love of God and your own body, hold the hammering!
Claire?
Sir, the Times want a reaction to the woman's death.
It was probably something she ate.
- He says, "It's something she ate."
- Oh, gee! Oh!
This is Frank Cross. We are appalled by this senseless tragedy...
Would you please hold the goddamned hammering!
Now!
- Shit!
- I'm going to lunch.
- How's everything going, Frank?
- Couldn't be better, Preston.
Mr Rhinelander, hello. Mr Cross.
May I get you both a drink?
I'll have a highball.
I'll have a highball, too.
You've heard from the embassy?
Yes. We'll be switching live back and forth from our "Scrooge" in the studio to Berlin, where Leroy Neeman's painting the wall.
Then we're shooting out to Africa, where the Holy Father will baptise the entire Zulu nation.
I'm afraid you might be spreading yourself a little thin.
So I've taken the liberty of hiring somebody to help you.
- Great(!)
- I knew you'd be pleased.
I couldn't be more pleased(!)
Who is it?
Pellegrino, rocks, twist...
How are ya?
Oh, look at this.
I know this is coming at you pretty fast, but I'm only here to take some of the burden off you.
You might see that as a threat...
That's me.
You will be visited by three ghosts.
Expect the first one tomorrow at noon.
This is coming at you pretty damn fast, but I'm here to take some of the burden off you.
That's me. Ever seen such a watch?
My dad gave me this.
But...
But when, er... Preston hired me this morning as... as a what... a...? a consultant, I suppose,
I said, "I'll be one of the team."
My, er...
My lacrosse coach used to say,
"There's no 'I', in T-E-A-M."
Here we are, gentlemen.
One for you, sir. And one for you.
I'm terribly sorry, I...
Are you him? Are you him?
Are you "he".
I'll take it away.
Don't come apart on me, Frank.
No. No. What was that your lacrosse coach said?
- The point is, Frank...
- Are you ready to order?
Great! I'll have the California health plate. No dairy in that, huh?
I'll have the rack of lamb today.
Sir?
Oh, my God!
Bobby, look!
Somebody save him!
That's a baked Alaska, sir.
A dessert.
Look!
No, sir, that's meatloaf.
You wouldn't want that, it's not very...
Sir?
- I'm gonna...
- Have...?
- Gonna have.
- Have...?
I'm gonna have some air. Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
I thought you were Richard Pryor.
- A cab!
- Yes, sir.
Cut through the park...
Whoa! Hey, man. Whoa!
Wrong way, jerk!
Nice hit back there! Solid hit!
- Wrong way!
- Relax, Frank. Enjoy the ride.
- How do you know my name?
- I know everything. You see...
I'm the ghost.
- You don't mind if I smoke?
- Smoke, smoke! Just drive.
Thanks, pal!
What did you do? What did you do?
That's not funny!
Pull over!
Where are we?
Where are we?
You mean "when are we?"
Look out!
Go back to Jersey, ya moron!
- Take me home right now.
- You got it, pal.
Welcome home, Frankie.
Oh, my God!
This is where I grew up.
I thought they tore it down.
They did.
Dad hasn't put up our Christmas lights.
Oh, for Chrissakes, Frank, it's Christmas Eve.
I get it. You've taken me back to show me my parents, and I'm meant to go all blubbery.
Forget it. You got the wrong guy.
That's what Attila the Hun said. But when he saw his mom, Niagara Falls.
Let's get this over with.
That was a great joke(!)
I love that bit!
Quiet! Somebody will call a cop.
Oh, relax, Frank.
They can't hear or see us.
It's not live.
It's like a re-run. Check it out.
We all drink our Ovaltine every day to give us our rocket power.
Hello, Earl.
You here, Francis?
I've got something for ya.
- Merry Christmas.
- A choo-choo train?
No, it's 5Ib of veal.
But, Daddy,
I asked Santa for a choo-choo.
Then go and get a job and buy a choo-choo!
Earl, he's only four years old.
All day I listen to excuses why people can't work -
"My back hurts. My legs ache.
I'm only four!"
He's gotta learn that life's doesn't come on a silver platter.
I'm going out.
Baby, don't watch too much TV.
OK, Mommy.
Merry Christmas, Frankie, angel.
Merry Christmas, Momma.
Niagara Falls, Frankie, angel.
I was touched by a gift.
A four-year-old kid receives what at today's prices is a 50 piece of veal.
Frank, you still spent the next
15 years on your ass watching TV.
Check the records. I did some stuff.
I played baseball. One year, I hit the home-run that won the big game.
That was the kid on
The Courtship Of Eddie's Father.
There was another time, though.
I was on a hill covered with flowers and there was a beautiful girl with pigtails...
You are so pathetic! That was
The Little House On The Prairie.
Was it the homecoming episode?
Yes, it was the homecoming episode.
Face it, garden slugs got more outta life than you.
Name one!
- Take me to my office.
- Gladly.
Where are we?
- It's your office.
- What's going on?
It's a Christmas party.
They've had them since the dawn of the golden age of TV.
Until YOU took over!
Merry Christmas. Pass those out.
Hey, hey! Hey, Fred!
- It's Frank, Mr Hayward.
- Frank.
You didn't notice a big party going on around here?
Yes, I'll be right out.
- I'll just finish this.
- OK.
- Merry Christmas!
- Why, thank you, Tina.
- Frank!
- Hi.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
Do you fancy Chinese food?
No. You're not supposed to eat that stuff.
They use cats in the chop suey.
Don't eat that stuff.
You moron! Get back there!
I don't believe myself.
What an idiot! Did you see Tina?
Frankie, I'm not that dead. Come on.
I must have been insane!
She was crazy about me.
Not that one, Frankie. This one.
Cupid's arrow.
Right between the eyes.
Are you all right?
You shouldn't move someone after a blow to the head.
Where did I get you?
Right here.
And the sidewalk got me back here.
It's gonna be quite a lump.
I'm sorry.
Is this yours?
Yes, it is. Thank you.
- You had some things, too.
- Yes.
Oh! Oh!
All right. I tell you what,
I'll go down for them.
- Wait for me?
- Yes, I'll wait.
- Thanks, Lumpy.
- Thank you.
Merry Christmas.
Would you like to go to a party?
- Not really.
- Neither would I.
Young lady!
Do you shop here often?
I can always walk on that side.
Would you like to have some Chinese food?
- What's going on?
- You are gonna love this.
- Claire!
- Yeah. What is it? I'm in the tub.
Can't we open the presents now?
What are you doing?
- You had it all!
- Look at something else.
Hey, there's a gorilla on that building.
- When can we open these?
- You can open one on Christmas Eve.
The rest are for Christmas morning.
Isn't that how your family did it?
If they were gonna spoil, we opened them the night before.
- Do you wanna open this one?
- Is it from you?
Oh, knives!
Oh, lots of knives!
I got her these great knives.
Super sharp...
I know, ginsu knives. They cut cans.
You can cut a tin can like a tomato.
Your turn.
I've never liked a girl enough to give her 12 sharp knives.
OK. You're gonna like this.
"To Lump."
"Love, Claire."
- "The Hindu Art of Love."
- Read the inscription.
You read it. It says,
"Christmas" and then...
It's Sanskrit.
I didn't need a manual.
I want you to know that.
Don't blow the ending for me now.
- Did that.
- With who?
- Did it.
- Yeah.
Done this.
Done this.
My buddy did this.
I don't believe this one.
It says this will make a woman bark like a dog.
Lassie's come home.
Go and get Gramps, Lassie.
I wonder if you're female?
What a nice coat you have. I think
I'll give you a bath every week.
Good morning, kiddos!
I'm Mike the Mailman.
Hey, Frisbee!
I've got something for ya.
There he is.
I've got to watch this one!
What could it be, huh?
Is it a pair of mittens?
It's a bone!
What could it be?
A book?
It's a bone!
What is it?
It's a bone, you lucky dog!
It's a bone, you betcha!
Lassie's a very good friend.
Commercial break, folks.
- Very good, kid.
- Thank you.
How many reservations should I make?
Oh, yes.
- You, me, my wife...
- She's in Palm Springs.
Oh, yes! I forgot. Of course.
I guess then... it'll be you and me.
And Frank.
Frank, have dinner with us.
You and Claire.
And order a stretch limo. See you.
- Hello. You're Claire?
- Yes.
Oh, hiya, sweetheart.
You almost ready?
The president of the network just invited us to dinner.
We're going to David and Kate's.
We can have dinner with them next week.
It's Christmas Eve. They're our best friends. It only comes once a year.
Thanks, Philbert.
It is Christmas.
It's a time to be less selfish.
If you could think of my needs and those of The Frisbee Show...
I've fought for this show.
It's such an opportunity.
I'm sorry.
60 seconds!
I didn't realise how important it is.
I'm willing to forgive you, once in a while.
Frank, look. Maybe we should separate for a while.
- Excuse me.
- Estelle, when are we leaving?
Right after the show.
For a while and see how it goes.
I know you've been under a lot of pressure.
Oh, it's been rough.
All right. I'll try to come over later, if I can.
15 seconds.
I'll tell them that you got hung up.
Lumpy.
Merry Christmas.
Five, four, three, two, one.
OK, kiddos!
You left Claire for Frisbee the dog?
Frank, you don't know who you are, you don't know what you want or what the hell is going on.
I've made a few mistakes.
I've gotta live with that.
But I know who I am.
I know what I want.
And I know what's going on.
Psst! Hey, Frank! Over here!
- What's going on?!
- I don't know. I'm only the ghost!
So long, sucker!
Hold on! Taxi!
I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off, one by one, until the master passion, greed, engrosses you.
Farewell, Ebeneezer.
May you be happy with the path you have chosen.
I am happy with what I've chosen, you bitch! I couldn't be happier!
- What, are you crazy?
- Yeah, Buddy. I'm crazy!
Crazy like a fox! Crazy enough to see through your tricks!
I'm back.
I see now.
No-one could have been that simple, and good, and sweet, yet caring and wonderful.
Not on this planet! No, baby!
Unless they had something to hide.
You wouldn't try to trick me? Don't try to trick me today, cos I'm back!
Maybe we'll check things out at Operation Reach Out!
Goodbye. Thank you.
20 a pint. Come on, folks!
Here's a happy donor.
Thank you so much.
Well, just for the record,
YOU left me.
YOU had to go and get your head together.
My head is just fine. Check it out!
It's right here where it belongs.
"It's Ionely at the top"? It's not!
Oh, maybe, round my birthday, and at sunset, and every couple of weekends,
I needed a really normal person.
That's me. I'm a widow of business!
It's my life! I've chosen it!
At least, I work some place you can
FIND when you're looking for it!
OK. Here we are now.
When I want a wife,
I'm gonna BUY one!
She's gonna be devoted to me, to my wants and my needs.
Not like YOU. Let's face it, you treated me like dirt!
Not another wild and woolly one.
Honey, you look frozen.
Let me get you a nice hot cup of coffee.
Hi, Dick. Herman.
I'm Billy. Eva, that's me.
Cocktail hour!
A drink for Mr Richard Burton.
Drink up!
Drink, just for me. For you, Dick.
- Dick knows how to live!
- Stop calling me Dick!
Sorry, Mr Burton.
Maybe we don't know you well enough, but, after "Exorcist Il", we thought we had something special.
Do a couple of lines from Hamlet, please.
Or "The Sandpiper"!
Leave me alone!
Do "Cleopatra" for me-please!
Please.
"I am Mark Anthony...
"Oh, no, do all... Abyssinia.
You know...
"...fall of Cheops...
By thee I foreswear."
Oh! Isn't that marvellous?
- Now BEAT IT before I beat you!
- "Where Eagles Dare"!
- Lumpy, what a surprise.
- Oh God, Claire!
- Claire.
- What are you doing here?
You said if it happened again
I should come by.
- What happened?
- Well...
I have been thinking a lot about the past.
And I started thinking,
"Well, I've made a lot of decisions,
"and what would have happened if I had made different decisions?"
- You know what I mean?
- Do you mean regret?
Yeah, I'm talking about regret.
You know the thing about regret is that it's never too late.
You can change.
- I deal with that every day.
- OK, deal with this.
I wanna take you some place right now and eat Chinese food.
Claire, we've got some huge problems!
There's no fuses in the whole joint.
There are. I'll just be a second.
The A & P didn't send any turkeys!
- Oh, no!
- Not one!
I'll call them. Can you wait?
They can handle this.
Just go to a store and buy fuses.
And the turkeys?
The turkeys are at the A & P.
It's in the phone book under "A".
- No, no, I have to call them.
- They're big girls...
...and THEY can do it! Atta girl!
- I'll be right there.
- Claire, fire these people!
Fire them?
They're volunteers.
They're here out of kindness.
Because no one will PAY them!
It's Christmas Eve.
They're like this every day, I guarantee it!
If you'll just wait one minute,
I'll just make the phone call.
No, don't bother.
Wait one minute. Let me finish what
I'm doing and I'll come with you.
Take the rest of your life!
Here's some advice, Claire - scrape 'em off.
If you want to save somebody, save yourself.
That's a wonderful attitude to have on Christmas Eve.
Merry Christmas.
Bah! Humbug!
Lumpy!
Dick, can you lend me two dollars?
Herman, I blew it all on Liz.
There's suckers inside.
This is the last dress rehearsal.
Pumping, jumping and bumping
Get up and dance
That's your cue, Buddy!
Cue Mr Houseman.
"Ebeneezer Scrooge hurried past the ragged boys,
"who stood shivering in the snow,
"gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs."
Why do I have to be molested by these sea urchins?
Stop!
Look, Buddy, it says "street urchins".
- That's what I said.
- What did he say, sea or street?
- Street urchins.
- He did! I'm sorry. You're right.
OK, everybody, that's dinner.
One hour! Including walking time!
One hour! You're doing great, Buddy!
We need more snow.
Watch that boom-shot.
You're right on my urchins.
Oh, Frank.
Baby, how are ya?
We were so worried about you.
You all right? We were worried.
I call the meal breaks around here.
Frank, sorry.
Hey, you can tell them it's dinner.
Hey, everybody, hold on! Frank's got something to say to ya! Go ahead.
It's time we had a talk, Brice.
I'd love to, but Preston asked me by for a drink so I'll take a raincheck.
Holt, where are you?
I need a cigarette.
Hi, Frank! Come on!
Come on out and play with me.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Ooh! I'm a little muddled.
Seven, eight. Ooh!
One, two...
Ooh, I'm so relieved.
It's been so long. Ah!
Hello, Frank.
I'm the Ghost of Christmas Present.
I had a funny feeling(!)
- Why did you do that?
- Sometimes you have to...
SLAP them in the face to get their attention.
Fine, slap me.
But you kicked me in the ba...
Hush, Frank.
It's time to begin a journey!
Now...
- Close your eyes and think...
- No!
- You close your eyes. I'm through...
- Oh, no!
Close your eyes...!
And think of snowflakes and moonbeams and whiskers on kittens...
Nooooo peeking!
Of rainbows, forget-me-nots... of misty meadows and sun-dappled pools.
Oh, look! There's Mr Hedgehog.
I wonder where he's going?
Perhaps to HARLEM!
My jaw!
Sometimes the truth is painful,
Frank.
But it's made your cheeks rosy and your eyes bright.
If you TOUCH ME AGAIN, I'll rip your goddamned wings off! OK?!
You know I like the rough stuff, don't you, Frank?
Oh, God!
Jingle, jingle bells.
Thanks.
Come on, Calvin. Come on.
Merry Christmas, Cooley family!
Mom, you didn't have to come get me.
Are you ready?
- Yeah.
- Good.
- Hi, Mom.
- Hello.
Come on, Mom!
- Hi, girls.
- Hi, Mom.
Is that all I get?
I'm going to freshen up.
Leave it alone. No one can do it.
- You two go and wash up now.
- OK, Gramma.
Oh, look. He did it!
He's bright. What's wrong with him?
He hasn't spoken since he saw his father killed five years ago.
He just drifted away like Sleeping Beauty.
I didn't know Grace's husband died!
Remember when she wore black for a year?
I remember her wearing black, but
I thought it was a fashion thing.
People were wearing black, you know.
Oh, Frank. My, my, poor Frank.
Is he gonna be OK?
It's his choice.
Only HE can break the spell.
Girls! Give him some Christmas love!
A Merry Christmas.
God bless us, every one.
Ma!
What are you doing? Get up!
Oh! Oh! Come in, Frank!
Come in and join the fun. Oh!
Oh! What a lovely family!
And they're so happy, but so poor!
- You tight-wad!
- She may need a raise.
- MAY?
- Probably!
- Probably?
- Yes!
- Maybe? Probably? Perhaps?
- I'm almost positive!
Get off your brother!
This boy is mine! PPHT!
Cut it out! Stop it!
Don't forget to watch the show.
I'm taking Calvin.
More!
Come on, Frank. Next stop, downtown!
Have was your trip, Frank.
A little joke! Hi, Pluto.
Bark, bark.
What are you barking at out there?
- Go, go!
- There's nothing there. Come on.
Let's get down to business!
What a merry feast.
- It looks like a beer commercial.
- Let's go in.
Don't mess, Frank. Or I'll fix your mouth so it won't hold soup.
A Christmas party!
I'm glad I wore my pretty dress.
On The Addams Family, what instrument did Lurch play?
On The Addams Family, what instrument did Lurch play?
I'm invisible, but I'm NOT DEAF!
Piano.
No, harpsichord.
A harpsichord, James, you dope.
- You knew that!
- Everyone knows that.
We'll give it to them.
You shouldn't have given it to them!
You forgot to open your brother's present.
That doesn't look like a towel.
- What did you get last year?
- I remember.
- A shower curtain!
- It WAS beautiful, with little...
- Little... Yeah!
- YOU don't have one!
What have you got him?
- I made this picture frame up...
- He made it with his own hands.
I know something you don't know!
- I know something you don't know!
- SHUT UP!
It's your basic, top-of-the-line Pioneer VCR!
I think he made a mistake.
I didn't get the gifts mixed up.
My EX-secretary got them mixed up.
You invite him every year and he's always busy. When will you learn?
Never. He's my brother.
A toast to my brother Frank.
I wish he was here.
- "Were", goofy.
- You're too good.
- To Frank.
- The richest man you know.
Keep the VCR.
What the hell, it's only money.
- It's tax-deductible.
- I understand, Frank. I understand.
What boat took them all to Gilligan's Island?
This is SO easy.
Er, Mako?
- You must know!
- Mackerel?
- No.
- A fish?!
- Leave me alone. I know this!
- Everybody does! Let's go.
- How about this?
- Oh, Frank, we're fighting again.
Let's not fight any more.
Look, Frank.
What is it?
It's a toaster!
The bitch hit me with a toaster.
I love a girl with spirit.
Where are you?
Well, this is nice(!)
Where are we, Trump Tower?
We've seen a bit of the city.
Hey! Down here! Down here!
Hey! Yo!
Hey, call Streets and Sanitation!
Thanks(!)
Hey, hey!
Oh! I'm having the weirdest day.
Cop! Hey, cop!
Help me!
Come here.
Jesus, give me a happy ending here,
Herm.
It's Dick.
Liz says hi.
I should've given you the two bucks.
You moron!
You jerk!
Why didn't you stay at Claire's?
She would have taken care of you!
You would have eaten and been warm!
You might be alive! You'd be a prettier colour, I'll tell you that!
Is there a way to get out of here,
Herman?
That's a door, isn't it?
It is a door, isn't it?
It's the door! A-HA!
It has to be the door, cos it's the only place that doesn't smell of...
...URINE!
Oh, SHIT!
Hey, you! Joker, get off the set!
Hey! We see you, pal.
Get off the set!
- Oh, my God!
- It's Mr Cross!
We've been looking all over for you.
Frank, come on. Frank!
Like Errol Flynn, huh?
- He's OK.
- You go up to your office.
You can check on the satellite links.
- We've got three minutes.
- I know.
Break a leg, everybody!
I feel weird about tonight.
Hear that, folks?
This one's for Frank. It's his baby.
Don't lose it on me, huh.
It's been an honour to work for the great Frank Cross.
I'll dine out on this for months.
I want Grace to take you upstairs, where things are safer than here. OK?
You're beautiful, Frank.
Got any last tips for me?
Oh, God! Grace, go watch the show!
He's here for me!
You think I'm afraid, the day I've had?!
I know what you came for.
Come and get it, you pussy.
- Brice!
- Stop scaring Frank.
Get this nutcake outta here.
Oh, Jesus.
He's in the show as the Ghost of Christmas Future.
He's great.
That guy's gonna be a big star.
Go watch the show...
Five seconds till we go live.
God bless us, every one.
Tonight, live on IBC, a Christmas classic -
Charles Dickens' immortal "Scrooge".
Ready to roll B.
Coming up on three.
Three, two, one...
And that's it. Slow pull-out.
Down on Houseman. Lights up.
It was a cold, bleak Christmas Eve.
The fog-draped streets of London were deserted...
- He's wonderful.
- Give me the beer.
Yes, sir.
..."Old Ebeneezer Scrooge was alone in his gloomy chambers."
As soon as we're off Houseman move to camera three.
- What have we here?
- They're dormice, Uncle.
You see. Works like a charm.
They bring you luck.
- Are you lucky?
- Sir, I am.
Your niece is my wife, I have a job, and it's the holidays.
Holidays, is it?!
"To Frank, the best brother a guy ever had."
Merry Christmas.
Where the snow lay round about
Deep and crisp and even
Brightly shone the moon that night
Though the frost was cruel, when a poor man came inside
Gathering winter fuel
This is indeed a night for revelation.
Thank you for showing me the true meaning.
Thank me not, Ebenezer, for soon you shall be visited by the final spirit.
The thing that all men fear the most -
The Ghost of Christmas Future.
Oh, help me.
If you were my friend you'd come by...
Honey, I'm home!
Remember me?
The guy you canned the day before Christmas? Merry Christmas.
- Hello, wabbit!
- Would you give me a chance?
- Sure.
My God! My babies!
Oh, you'd better watch out...
Can't you get back to me?
I've had a bad day.
YOU'VE had a bad day!
I'll tell you about mine!
I got fired, my wife left me, she took our little baby daughter... with her.
I can't recall much after that because... since then...
I've been blind, stinking DRUNK!
He sees you when you're sleeping...
Believe me, Eliot! I'm having a worse day than you! Much worse!
He knows that you've been bad
So be good for goodness' sake
He's making a list
He's checking it twice
He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town
Oh, it's you!
Creep. God!
Shouldn't you be in the studio?
Back off, big man. It may work with the chicks. Is this straight?
May I?
Did our people do that?
We're gonna get phone calls.
Visiting hours are over, Mrs Cooley.
- I just got here!
- We have to go.
Merry Christmas, Calvin.
I'll see you.
This is a possible future, right?
This is do-able.
I know the head of paediatrics at
NYU. We'll get this kid out of here!
I'm all over this!
Will you look at that!
- Where did they come from?
- Hey, you!
- Beat it!
- Please?
Gilles, will you look at those filthy little creatures?!
Immédiatement!
Oh, Claire, Claire.
They're just children.
Please, darling.
Don't tell ME.
I wasted 20 years on pathetic little creatures like those.
Finally, thank God, a friend said to me,
"Scrape 'em off, Claire.
"If you want save somebody, save yourself."
I'm sorry, Claire.
Thanks a lot, Lumpy.
Thanks.
That was a lousy thing to do.
Disneyland?
Wendie!
Oh, no.
James. My brother.
He's dead.
Why did this have to happen?
Well, when I get back I'II...
There he is! James!
Who's in there?
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.
"He maketh me to lie down in green pastures, he leadeth me beside the still waters..."
What the hell are you saying?
What? That I've died?
Why are you showing me this?
Why bother to show me this? Oh, jeez.
Help me.
No. Oh!
Don't let them burn me, James!
Jimmy, don't let them burn me!
I'm in here! Oh, God!
Don't let them do it!
Don't let them do it! I'm in here.
No!
I gotta live!
I wanna live!
Oh, God! I wanna live!
I wanna live!
I wanna live!
I'm alive!
Shit! What a break! I'm at work!
It's the sun!
- Oh, God! It's the sun! I'm alive!
- Not for long!
Milkman!
Baby, I'm gonna start with you.
Come here!
I'm alive and so are you!
Glad to see me, or is that a shotgun in your pocket?
OK, you heard it! Come on!
Great!
- Don't hurt me!
- Relax! Pinch that!
Coming back! Long sole.
You know this one?
That's my thing!
Here's the deal.
I hire you at twice your old salary.
I make you my vice-president.
- Would you like my office?
- No!
- That's so you!
- What's the catch?
The catch is that you've got to take a shower, little man.
There's a problem here. I was looking for a Francis Xavier Cross.
That's me! But the great thing is, it's not me!
The Jews taught me this great word - schmuck. I was a schmuck.
And now I'm not a schmuck.
Wait!
- What's the time?
- My watch!
It's a quarter to! We didn't miss it!
- We didn't miss it!
- What?
Christmas! Merry Christmas! Wow!
Are you alone in there?
We're gonna have some fun.
We're gonna have fun for once.
Loudermilk and Cross together.
My, what a glorious day.
There has never been such a day!
Say, there!
- You, lad!
- Yes, sir. Do you mean me?
- Take three.
- Yes, indeed!
Buy me a goose.
The biggest goose in all of London.
Camera three, follow the coin all the way.
Got it.
Holy shit! That's Frank Cross.
He's nuts!
He's finished!
Shut up!
Don't touch that dial!
- Mike, say hello to your folks.
- Hi.
Thanks, Mike.
That's Frank Cross.
- Is he meant to be on?
- What in the...?
Merry Christmas.
Eliot, how are things up there?
- Open his mike.
- Wonderful.
But I don't think you'll be president tomorrow.
At least I'm network president tonight.
- Tomorrow I may not be.
- You can bet your ass on that!
What are you doing watching television on Christmas Eve!
Paying your salary, you ass!
What sort of idiot would schedule... a live show on Christmas Eve?
Only you, Frank!
A week ago I'd have kicked your butt out of here.
But he's absolutely right.
You're looking at a guy who told someone today to staple antlers to a mouse's head to further my career.
How many of you would try something like that?
Stay on him.
All these people have incredible families, but I have a great brother.
Look at this guy. Here.
Wasn't he cute?
That's me with the ears-a car with open doors! Thank God my hair grew!
I got this today from him.
I gave him a towel.
The VCR is from Grace, James.
You were right about everything, OK?
Except... the SS Minnow, James.
What ship took them all to Gilligan's Island? The SS Minnow.
No points this round, James.
- Wait a minute... Wait...
- How did he know we played that?
Hello, Wendie.
Ouch! Control room, how can I help you?
It's Rhinelander.
Who put that moron on the air?!
Brice Cummings, sir. But he can't talk to you right now. He's tied up.
Uh-huh.
Yes, in fact he just said that
- You're a flatulent butt-head.
- A butt-head?
He's never liked a man in quite the way he likes you.
Oh, no!
Just kidding! She's a doll. It's OK.
It's a party.
It's Christmas Eve. Lighten up.
Billy, we need champagne for 250 people, and don't send the stuff
I usually send to other people.
You can still have fun tonight.
Call people you haven't seen - a college friend, an old army buddy, your personal banker.
Hey! I don't hear any partying in that booth!
Great!
- Go on, party!
- Why wasn't I invited?
That was just an innocent window and you saw what I did to that!
It's a night you've gotta party hearty, Marty.
Check this out. Whoa-ho!
Don't be so mean. Ugh!
Look!
There's a rule, a tradition which says...
I have to kiss this girl.
She's just upholding the law.
It's a federal law, actually.
Oh, Mr Cummings!
Boy, that was very good.
But you know what?
It wasn't great.
There's only been one "great".
There is a girl... that I wish I were with tonight.
It's a girl that I loved a long time ago.
A girl that I still love.
It's not too late, is it?
Claire, you remember the Kama Sutra, page 19?
Our legs are like this. You circle me, chanting, before we begin?
It was practically impossible.
Tonight, we could do this without serious physical damage.
- I need to get to IBC in 3 minutes.
- Which floor?
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Tis the season to be jolly
Don we now our gay apparel
Troll the ancient yuletide carol
We should be taping this.
How did that happen?
That happened because it's Christmas Eve.
I'm not crazy. It's Christmas Eve.
It's the one night when we all act a little nicer.
We... we smile a little easier.
We... we... share a little more.
For a couple of hours we are the people we always hoped we would be.
It's really a miracle because it happens every Christmas Eve.
And if you waste that miracle, you're gonna burn for it. I know.
You have to do something. You have to take a chance and get involved.
There are people that don't have enough to eat and who are cold.
You can go and greet these people.
Take an old blanket out to them or make a sandwich and say, "Here."
"I get it now."
And if you give, then it can happen, the miracle can happen to you.
Not just the poor and hungry,
Everybody's gotta have this miracle!
It can happen tonight for you all!
If you believe in this pure thing, the miracle will happen and you'll want it again tomorrow!
You won't say, "Christmas is once a year and it's a fraud." It's not!
It can happen every day!
You've just got to want that feeling!
You'll want it every day!
It can happen to you!
I believe in it now.
I believe it's gonna happen to me, now. I'm ready for it!
And it's great. It's a good feeling.
It's better than I've felt in a long time.
I'm ready.
Have a Merry Christmas. Everybody.
Calvin!
Did I forget something, big man?
God bless us, every one.
Lumpy! Lumpy, no!
Oh! Feels like boating a marlin.
Claire, the whole world.
The whole world, Claire.

Aah!
Three minutes.
The girl. Now!
Let's hurry a bit, shall we?
Come on!
Faster, faster!
Read!
Or we're all gonna die!
Uhh...
Aah!
Aah!
No! Come back
Aah!
Well, well, well.
Are you two sitting comfortably?
Good. Now. Gentlemen.
Do you see these file folders?
The ones with your names on them?
Can you guess what's in these file folders?
I'll give you a hint.
Discipline reports.
Lots of them.
And some wonderful artwork as well.
This is...?
Spider with human head?
I'm sorry. Spider?
With human head.
Yeah. He eats dogs and cats and rabbits.
Does he?
Sean thought him up.
You see, sir, we kinda have this monster club, okay?
And we draw those pictures to put on our clubhouse walls.
Correction,
Mr. Crenshaw.
You draw pictures during Mrs. Carlson's science class when you're supposed to be paying attention.
Wait. I just want to say one thing.
I mean, Ms. Carlson's a nice teacher and all, but she's boring and has an odd-shaped head.
That's why Sean and the guys call her "Meow Mix,"
'cause her head's shaped like a cat head.
But I don't, sir,
'cause-- how rude.
Boys...
I hear you.
I was a kid once.
I thought monsters were cool.
And maybe, well-- well, gosh... maybe I'm just a big kid, because, Sean, Patrick...
...I think science is cool.
I dig it, man.
Now, I'm sure both of you know a great deal about monsters, but that's not the issue here.
The issue is...
...science is real.
Monsters are not.
We don't know that, sir.
God, can you believe
Mr. Metzger?
Tell me about it. He touched me and patted my shoulders and stuff.
The guy was fully homo-ing out.
I smell like the '40s.
I mean, when they send you to school, why don't they tell you about the homos and people with cat heads--
Ooh!
Oh!
Sorry,
Mrs. Carlson.
Meow. Meow.
She's married, Sean.
Oh, my God! Some guy kisses her at night?
I mean, a priest said,
"I now pronounce you man and wife," and it was okay with him?
Hey.
Where's Fat Kid?
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our show.
Tonight's question:
What makes Fat Kid fat?
Fat kid?
Get out of here,
E.J.
"Get out of here, E.J."
Nope.
Not a good answer.
Doesn't make any sense.
Let's go to our man on the street. Derek.
Hi. I'm Derek, and I'm in the street where Fat Kid is blocking traffic.
Fat Kid, can't you stop eating?
Look, I have a glandular problem, okay?
At least I don't have a... stupidity problem.
What'd you say, faggot?
What'd you say?
My name's Horace!
Horace.
Whore-ass.
Oops.
I tore it.
I guess I must have a stupidity problem.
What'd you say, faggot?
What'd you say?
I said,
"You're an asshole."
Hey, Rudy.
E.J.
See you met my friend Horace.
You okay?
Rudy, I, uh--
Shh!
You dropped your candy bar, E.J.
It's his.
It's your now.
Rudy-- Eat.
Rudy, I'm not gonna--
Eat up!
And we'll call it a day.
Look, Patrick,
I told you before,
Wolfman cannot drive a car.
Yes, he can.
No, he can't!
Yes, he can.
All I'm saying is,
Sean, he could if he had to.
He could not. You're being such a dork!
I know you are, but what am I?
A dork.
I know you are, but what am I?
Oh, great. A feeb.
A dork.
I know you are, but what am I?
A dork.
I know you are, but what am I?
Infinity! Look,
Wolfman doesn't go to work.
He's not, like, a guy.
What are you talkin' about?
He walks around.
He wears pants.
He had to wear pants
'cause those movies were made in the '40s.
He had to wear 'em so you wouldn't see his-- wolf dork.
Wolf dork?
You guys!
I saw him.
He was watching us.
Who?
Scary German Guy.
Sean, he give me the creeps.
Oh, he's just a dude on welfare.
Maybe he's a German spy.
Oh, good one.
We're not at war with Germany anymore.
We're at war with Vietnam.
What?
It's in Rambo.
You guys missed it!
Oh! Fat Kid!
Rudy saved my life!
Do you think we could talk him into joining the Monster Club?
Can we?
Huddle.
Huddle.
Sean, he's in junior high.
I hear he killed his dad.
Get out of here,
Phoebe the Feeb!
Okay, you guys.
We should let him in on one condition.
Monster test.
You guys!
I saw Scary--
I saw him!
I saw Scary German Guy!
He was watching!
I'm depressed.
What for?
What do you mean, what for?
I'm flyin' a World War II bomber with wooden crates in it and dead bodies.
I should have a party?
Do they complain?
Do they get airsick?
Do they ask for more of the little almond things?
You're right.
This is a great job.
I'm really happy.
I thought they were dead.
They are.
I'm goin' to, uh...
I'm gonna check it out.
Okay. Good.
You do that.
I'll stay here and make spooky sounds.
Aah!
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Where are you, you son of a bitch?
Oh...
Uhh!
Two ways to kill a vampire.
Good one, Fat Kid.
Excellent question.
Uh, stake through the heart.
Right.
What else?
Oh, real good.
Eugene.
I wasn't talking.
Get him in a muzzle, will ya?
It was Pete.
You guys meet up here a lot, or, uh...
Every day.
Do we meet up here a lot?
Eugene!
Man!
Eugene, make
Pete shut up.
Do you really think that was a good question?
Rudy!
Are you gonna listen or look out the window?
I told you he didn't want to be in the club.
Lighten up, Patrick.
No way!
Hey, we're tryin' to do the test here, you know.
You're gonna piss him off.
I'm beginnin' to like this club.
Rudy! Come on.
It's a monster test.
It's important. Okay?
Second way to kill a vampire.
Mmm...I give up.
Daylight.
Sunlight.
Ha ha ha!
Fat Kid, what other kind of light is there durin' the day?
Go away, Pete!
Okay, question two.
Is Frankenstein the name of the monster or the guy who made him?
The guy.
Right.
Can't you read?
Mom said you have to let me in the club, or else it's prescruption.
That's discrimination, jerkoid.
"Prescription" is drugs, which you're on if you think you're gettin' up here.
Come on, Sean!
I know about monsters.
Come on! Let me in the club!
Two ways to kill a werewolf.
Silver bullet?
And?
That's it. Shoot him with a sliver bullet.
Nope. Sorry, Rudy.
Ha ha!
Okay, so, what's the other way?
What?
Second way to kill a werewolf?
Um...
Car crash?
Accident with power tools?
Old age?
Falling out a window.
Onto a bomb!
Sean! Phoebe! Dinner!
Oops. Gotta go.
Wait. Am I in or what?
I mean it, spaz.
You gotta stop it.
Uh, uh, uh, uh!
Wash up for dinner, guys.
Boring guy, boring guy, boring guy, boring guy.
What's this, Mom?
Huh? Oh, I got that for you today at Jane Burgess' garage sale.
Says it's from that old house up on Shadowbrook Road.
Holy shit! Uh, sor-- cow.
Um, I'm sorry.
Mom, do you know who wrote this book?
Yeah. It's, what,
Van Helsing something.
Now, he's the one that fights Godzilla.
Right?
Dracula, Mom.
Well, then which is the really tall one?
That's Godzilla.
My God!
Abraham Van Helsing.
This is great!
This is German.
Let it begin.
Hey, slick.
Busy day?
Not really.
Shoot any crooks today?
Afraid not.
But I still may if you don't wash up for dinner.
What's on your mind?
Well, Dad, uh, some of the guys and me
were maybe gonna go see
Groundhog Day Part 12 tonight, only if it's okay with you.
Is it? Please?
Oh, we got a problem.
No way!
Yes, way.
I gotta go out with your mother tonight.
You got a certain
5-year-old sister who needs baby-sitting.
Oh, come on, Dad!
I've waited all year to see this movie!
Pal, it's only a movie.
Look, tomorrow night,
you and I'll go see
Groundhog Day.
I'll get home early.
Tomorrow night?
That'll be too late!
The guys will blab the entire plot!
What?
Did I hear "plot"?
Sean, it is a guy with an ax.
Anyway, I thought they killed him in the last one.
They did.
And he returns from his grave.
Returns from the grave?
Sean, he always returns from the grave.
If they blew him up, put his head in a blender, and mailed the rest of the pieces to Norway, he would still return from the grave.
That was part seven.
You want to know what the plot is?
The plot separates you from my five bucks.
I want to see a stupid movie.
Well,  you can't.
You're baby-sitting.
Fine. Can I have five bucks anyway?
Absolutely.
So, where you two goin' tonight?
Marriage counselor.
Again?
I thought you quit smoking.
Sean.
Son, I love you dearly, but do me a favor.
Put your basic lid on it.
Now, get outta here.
Hello. Yeah?
Officer, please!
Lock me up!
Lock--
Yeah. I'm a werewolf!
I'm a werewolf!
Please. Please.
Hey, Del.
I know it sounds crazy, but...
Bad news.
Listen, I gotta go downtown.
Can you reschedule that appointment?
Honey, I'm a cop, okay?
You knew that when you bought the package.
Look.
It's important.
I'm important.
I love you.
Prove it.
I'll see you in a few hours.
Just for a night!
You see, it's a full moon!
And I'm a werewolf!
Take it easy.
You don't understand!
You gotta lock me up!
You gotta put me in a cage!
Buddy,
I'd like nothin' better!
Hold onto your pants!
Oh, God! You don't understand!
You've gotta-- Oh!
Anything you say, fella.
Put the cuffs on him.
I got it.
All right.
I got him now.
Aah!
Jesus Christ!
We need some backup!
Bon voyage!
Lock me up!
So, let me get this straight.
You tellin' me there was this 2,000-year-old mummy here, right?
Yes, sir.
Uh-huh.
Well, now he's not here. He's gone.
Vanished. History.
Yes, sir.
And you're sayin' you didn't hear anybody come in here or leave.
Is that right?
Can you hear me now?
Hello?
I can hear you fine.
So, nobody took the mummy.
I would've heard them.
Of course he would've.
What a stupid question.
Did you take him?
No, sir!
Just a shot.
That's it, Del.
This case is too hard, man.
Let's be firemen instead.
I'm glad you're gettin' major laughs out of this, Rich.
The problem is,
2,000-year-old dead guys do not get up and walk away by themself.
Accident patrol,
uh, request confirmation.
You have the 915-H officer-involved shooting en route?
Aah!
Aah!
My God!
You scared me!
Where are Steve and Judy?
I thought they were with you.
Not funny.
Well, something funny's...
What did I miss?
Judy? Steve?
Hey!
Oh, sheriff.
You scared us.
Never mind about that.
This is the best part.
Judy!
No!
Lieutenant, you wanna come over and take a look at this?
Dispatch, Unit 7.
Unit 7, come in, please.
Please copy.
Wonderful. Great!
Just what I need.
Come again? You're--
What?
Uh, request, uh, cadaver--
I can't hear you!
No, no, no!
I said "missing"!
The body's missing!
It's the second one tonight.
Confirmed. That makes two tonight, right, Lieutenant?
Ha, ha.
That's very funny.
And you want to shut up about it?
It's been so long.
So very long.
Wake up, old friend.
It is our time.
Long...time...
...Master.
And you put the candle next to your bed like this.
Your mom did this when you were a little girl?
Uh-huh.
It means
"I love you."
And as long as it's here, nothing bad can happen.
Sean says when it lightnings, monsters come.
Oh, he's just trying to scare you, honey.
Will lightning hit the house?
No.
The candle keeps it away?
That's right.
Say goodnight to Scraps.
Goodnight, Scraps.
Good night, Emily.
Mwah.
Good night, sweetheart.
Are you gonna yell at him?
Honey...
I love your father.
What?
I mean Sean, for scaring me.
Of course you did.
I'll talk to him about it, sweetheart.
Sweet dreams.
You're thinki'' about your job, isn't that right?
I can see it in your eyes, Del.
Yeah! I'm glad you can see it in my eyes,
'cause for a minute there
I thought I had you fooled.
Come on, this isn't--
No, come on!
Look in my eyes.
Look in my eyes!
I'll think about stuff, and you can tell me when I'm thinking correctly!
Keep your voice down.
I don't want the children--
I had a lousy night, all right?
Every night
I have a lousy night.
I'm sorry it's such a pain in the ass for you with my stupid little job!
I am trying to explain--
Some guy steals a priceless Egyptian mummy...
That happens every day.
Skip that.
Then I get a call from some nutcase who's shouting he's a werewolf!
Huh? You like that?
What do they do?
They blow him away right there in the police station!
Wait a minute!
There is more to this!
...marriage counseling!
For what?
Wha?
There's a monster in my closet.
Damn, son, look!
All of these monsters!
Come on, all of you monsters, outta here!
Everyone, out of this room!
Come-- Ahh, ahh!
You, on the bed.
Come on. Out. Out.
Take a hike.
There he goes.
You see any more monsters?
In the closet?
Sure. We can go into the closet.
We can do that.
Okay, monsters!
Whoo!
Look at that big, scary monster!
Ooh!
Listen. You are not gonna sleep with your mother and me tonight, so you can forget it.
And keep this up, and you're not gonna look at those monster magazines.
Understand?
Uhh?
Okay.
We're all here.
What's the deal?
Yeah.
What the hell's
Monster Squad?
It's us.
We're the Monster
Squad.
Since when?
Since now!
What's a "squad"?
It's like
Miami Vice, I think.
Look. I think there's monsters.
Like, real ones.
I heard my dad talking on the telephone to a guy down at the police station.
There was a guy screaming he was a werewolf.
And they shot him.
And the body disappeared from the coroner van.
And the coroner guy was dead.
So what? He got shot, and the werewolf took his body?
No, you pinhead!
He was a werewolf!
Maybe.
But if they shot him...
They must've been regular bullets, not silver ones.
Look, I know this will sound pretty stupid, but a mummy disappeared from the museum tonight.
Mummy came in my house.
And, guys...
Dracula might be here, too.
Aw, man,
Fat Kid farted!
Oh, God.
Did not.
Can't you hold it? God!
God damn it, would you shut up?
Did you hear a word I said?
The guys are dead!
Get a clue!
Something's out there, and it's killin' people!
And if it's monsters, nobody's gonna do a thing about it but us.
So, what do we do?
Think this book might be important.
Look. It's
Van Helsing's diary.
Mom said they found it in an old house on Shadowbrook Road.
But I can't read it.
It's all in German.
My sister takes German in high school.
Your sister doesn't speak German.
All she does is hang around, and the guys touch her tits.
Your sister wouldn't happen to live next-door, would she?
So what?
That girl's your sister?
So, what do you say?
Are we Monster Squad...
...or what?
Cool.
All right.
How does that dog get up here, anyways?
Old friend.
How do you like your new home?
Home.
I must sleep soon, so listen very carefully.
Van Helsing's diary...
...is missing.
I want you to retrieve it for me.
You understand?
Yes...
Master.
Children...possess it.
I want you to find them and take the diary.
If they do not cooperate...
...you will kill them.
Gentlemen, I'd just like to say three words:
Scary German Guy.
Who else are we gonna get to translate this thing?
Come on. Somebody go up and knock.
You knock.
You're our leader.
Firstly, he's scary, okay?
And "B," he's German.
Maybe he doesn't even speak English.
Okay, so what's
German for...
"Please don't murder us"?
Bitte, moerden-zie uns nicht.
Boys... time is almost up.
It's your last chance for pie.
Thanks, Mister, uh, guy.
Now, here we go.
I mean...
No, thanks.
So? Ja?
Now, where were we?
Ah... ja.
"The amulet itself is fairly small and carved with intricate symbols."
Oh.
Rather an odd-looking thing, don't you think?
Scary German
Guy's bitchin'.
Sir, the thing
I don't understand is the part about the equilibrium.
Well, according to this rather curious book you have brought me,
"The forces of good and evil--"
Uh, that is a B-17, in case you are wondering.
It's rad!
"Good and evil
"are in constant flux,
"back and forth.
"Only once, every hundred years, are these forces balanced."
And what about the amulet?
The amulet, so nearly as I can translate, is "concentrated good.
"It is a talisman which wards off evil and is..." how you say, uh...
"indestructible"?
That means it can't be destroyed.
Or, in any case, normally destroyed.
However, and this part is underlined...
"Once every hundred years,
"at the stoke of midnight,
"the amulet becomes vulnerable,
"and at that moment, it can be shattered."
And if it is?
Then the balance between good and evil will shift, and evil will rule.
However, our friend
Mr. Van Helsing claims there is a way to stop the forces of darkness.
How?
"If one could gain possession of the amulet before those forces..."
"...then every hundred years,
"at midnight,
"there is another option:
"a ceremony which, when followed to the letter,
"will open a hole
"into Limbo itself
"where dwell the damned;
"a vortex,
"which like a great whirlwind,
"can swallow the forces of evil forever."
Well...does it describe the procedure at all?
In detail.
This was the last entry.
On this date, he was to battle those forces himself.
Interesting.
It is tomorrow's date, one hundred years ago!
A hundred years ago?
Tomorrow night.
Thank you very much.
Thanks.
Bye. Thank you very much for all your time.
Thank you.
I expect you boys thought
I was some kind of monster myself?
Hmm?
A vampire, perhaps?
That's quite all right.
But I am not, you know.
If I were a vampire, then I wouldn't have a reflection.
Now, would I?
Man, you sure know a lot about monsters.
Now that you mention it...
I suppose I do.
Guys, wait up!
Tomorrow night?
What do we have to do again?
Blow a hole in Dumbo?
Limbo, stupid.
So, how do we know the amulet's there, anyway?
Because, you dweeb,
Dracula's obviously here looking for it.
If we don't find it before he does, we're beast bait.
Okay, so, say we get the amulet.
Then what?
Wait till midnight...and?
We get a virgin.
A virgin?
Yeah.
Okay, right.
Then what?
Well, our virgin takes the amulet, reads the magic spell from the book, and, blamo, we blow a hole in Limbo.
That's so easy.
Oh, a cinch.
Piece of cake.
Yeah.
Rudy. Question.
Shoot.
Know any virgins?
Okay. Rudy, find some silver bullets.
And where the hell am I supposed to find silver bullets?
Kmart?
I don't know.
Gimme a break.
Fat Kid, get a map.
Find Shadowbrook
Road.
What, do I look in the index for
"big, scary mansion"?
Oh, you're a riot.
You guys!
How can we trust
Scary German Guy?
Why would he lie about a thing like this?
Sean!
Phoebe, have a life.
Okay?
You're being a spaz!
Ow! God!
You bit me, you brat!
I'm tellin'
Mom on you!
Would ya look?
Huh?
It's okay, you guys!
He's friends with us.
Come on!
Don't be chickenshit!
Come on.
I want to show you my friends.
Sean, no.
Oh, go for it.
Sean, are you crazy?
That's a walkin' dead guy.
Sean, please don't die.
Are...are you dead?
D-Dead?
Does Mom know about him?
No. Only us.
Hey, guys, get over here!
He's great!
Huh.
Uhh!
Now can I be in the Monster Club?
I can't believe it.
Frankenstein's monster in our clubhouse.
Let's ask him to leave, okay?
You're not still scared, are you?
Well, he is a little bit gross, Sean.
Scr...
Scra-aps.
I taught him to talk.
Bo-gus.
Give me... a...break.
Huddle up, you guys.
Sean, we gotta get an adult.
And your dad's a cop, so if we get your dad--
Absolutely no grown-ups. Okay?
They'll lock him up in a cage or something.
Dissect him.
Or put him on TV!
Fat Kid.
Ha ha ha!
Why are you such a lame-oid?
You're the lame one.
Bogus!
Bogus.
Dudes, check it out.
Sc...
Scary?
The amulet is in here.
Very near, yes.
Oh...Van Helsing, your disciples were very clumsy, trying to hide from me the very thing that is mine.
No hiding, never, from me.
Ah! It's here!
My prize.
Oh...
Soon, Van Helsing... soon, the creatures of the night shall rule the world.
And there is no one to stop us!

I do regret the dosage, my friend.
Most, um...lethal... by human standards.
But then, um, human standards do not apply, do they?
Well, uh, I'll, uh, go have a bite while you change into something more, um... comfortable.
Last night, near the ambulance crash, get this-- eyewitness report: long black hearse.
No plates.
You wanna ask me about the hood ornament?
What about the hood ornament?
I thought you'd never ask.
A silver skull.
I consider this an exciting lead.
I am excited.
Are you excited?
I'm thrilled.
Put out an APB.
I already did.
I'm a very good policeman.
You know?
Crenshaw.
Hurry!
Get all your men and send them down to 666
Shadowbrook road!
It's an old mansion!
He's found the amulet!
There's-- There's no time!
Who the hell is this?
I'm the one they shot last night!
I'm a werewolf now, but--
Have a nice night.
No! No! No! No!
Don't hang up!
Uhh! He's gonna kill your son!
Patrick!
Come in. Patrick.
Patrick, come in.
Yeah, we're here.
Where are you?
We're almost there.
Everything set with you?
Know in a minute.
Rudy?
Rudy!
This babe is major.
Rudy's in love.
Well, good for Rudy.
Thanks a lot, Pete.
Okay, remember-- rendezvous position "A",
2200 hours.
Uhh...
Say what?
How do we know the amulet's there, anyway?
We don't, but it's all we have to go on.
Sean.
Okay. Well. good luck, butt love.
Sean.
I know you are, but what am I?
Sean.
Out.
What, Eugene?
Creature stole my Twinkie.
So?
What did you want to ask me?
What do we want to ask you.
Okay. Um, Sis... me and Ru--
Rudy?
Your show, Ace.
Okay.
We just wanted to know... if you're a virgin.
What?
Okay. What we want to know is... are you a--
Ahem. Look.
What your brother is so delicately attempting to inquire, and let me, out of my own personal curiosity, is the degree to which you may have or... have not, at some point in time...
...been dorked?
You guys are sick!
Guess what.
Fox Photo's got a two-for-one deal this week, and wouldn't you know it, there's a space on the bulletin board right between the prom committee notes... and the football roster.
Sean.
About this
Monster Squad thing.
Maybe we could go back to the clubhouse and rethink it with the other guys.
Fat Kid...you're bein' a wuss.
Wuss?
Can it, Frank.
Time's runnin' out.
Sean, no!
Scary house... real monsters... us...12 years old?
Remember?
Midnight... end of world.
Remember?
Master...is near.
Master wants children dead.
Um, Sean?
Maybe we could be like Math Squad instead, you know... do math problems.
Stay home.
Or Nature Squad.
We could look at rocks, collect birds.
Not be dead. See, it's this whole death thing
I'm not crazy about.
Well...no amulet.
Let's go.
Look. We got two consolations.
Number one,
Frankenstein's on our side.
And number two, my dad's a cop.
Anybody fools around with us, he kicks their ass.
Hey, Frankie.
Come on.
Frank!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Eugene, get away from there!
He won't wake up!
Fat Kid, use your eyes.
Does it look like you can help him?
But-- But what do I do, Sean?
A monster!
Don't call him a monster.
Well...what if he's dead?
Then he died to help us.
Now, look.
I'm the leader of this squad, so listen up.
He said Dracula knows we're here.
So let's just try to find the amulet...
...and get the hell outta here.
Sean!
Aah!
Kick him in the nards!
What?
Kick him in the nards!
He doesn't have nards!
Do it! Do it!
Wolfman's got nards!
Come on! Come on!
Oh...
Aah!
What are you doin'?
Haven't you read
The Hardy Boys?
You pull some lever down and a secret door opens!
You gotta be kidding!
You have a better idea?
Come on, Sean.
Damn!
Where is he?
Where are you?
Come in!
Sean!
Where are you,
Sean?
They're late.
Maybe the monsters got them.
"Maybe the monsters got them."
Can we go home, Sean?
Oh, great.
Please? Can't we go home?
Just great.
Frankenstein's dead,
Eugene's whining, and we're sitting here with Pirate Bill.
Come on, Sean.
Man, we're dead.
Eugene, stop it.
Bingo.
You guys, I got it!
Give it to me.
Give it to me!
Aah!
Get out of here!
Get out of here!
Help!
Give it to me!
Aah!
Garlic! Come on!
Get outta here!
You guys, we got Scary German Guy to help us!
The cavalry!
Thank Christ.
Yeah, we figured you guys were in trouble.
It was boss!
I saw Dracula!
And I kicked Wolfman in the nards--
Fat Kid, bag it. Okay?
Is she a virgin?
Why don't you put it on the 6:00 news, you little shit?
Yeah, she is.
Perhaps we should all go back to my place for some pie.
The book was right.
Don't you see?
It's all true!
We found the amulet, but now there's monsters after us.
We gotta go to a place where there's a lot of people.
Church.
What?
Church!
He's right.
There's an old church in the town plaza.
Perfect.
Monsters hate religious stuff.
Del.
Del. Del!
Look, I'm sorry.
What, you tryin' to tell me that we're gonna go all the way out to Shadowbrook Road because you get a call from some guy who tells you he's a werewolf?
Ha ha ha!
Ho ho!
Look, I'm sorry.
I guess it's feasible, Del.
Listen to me.
Come on, man.
I apologize. All right?
Ha ha ha!
Look! It's 20 minutes till midnight!
We pull this off,
I'm gonna shit!
Holy shit!
Jesus Christ!
Give me some slack!
What are you doing?
Patrick, just give me some slack!
No!
You're closer! Just give me some slack!
No way!
Don't be a wuss!
Okay!
Aah!
Come on! Hurry!
Yes!
Come on! Let go! Let go!
Let go of her! Let go!
Aah!
Go! Go!
Go! Look at that!
It's dust!
Come on! Yes! Come on!
Go! Whoa!
See you later...
Band-Aid breath.
Whoo-hoo!
Del, I don't know if you're aware of this, but we're going a hundred miles an hour!
I notice little things like that.
I'm a very good policeman.
You know that?
Aah!
Aah!
I'm not sayin' anything.
Not a single word.
I appreciate that.
Meeting adjourned.
Dispatch to Unit 28. Please respond.
Freeze!
You move, and
I'll kill you!
Dispatch, we got a 10-35.
Send backup! Hurry it up!
Del!
Get outta there!
That's enough.
I will have your son.
Del?
Del?
D-Del, what's happening?
What?
The kids.
Sean?
Phoebe.
Phoebe?
Sean!
Phoebe!
Sean, can you hear me?
Where are you?
Sean! Can you hear me?
Where are you?
Dad! I'm here!
We're almost to Town Square.
Hurry up!
Don't kick the church!
It's religious!
It's locked is what it is.
Fine.
Okay.
We'll just have to do it right here.
Like, really religious, Sean.
Why don't we just go over and do it in Burger King?
You guys!
Oh, shit!
Patrick, come on!
Okay, come on, read the book.
Go!
Okay!
Read! Go!
Wait!
Read!
I'm flunking German!
Read it in German.
Try.
Damn! Really, you should read it!
He's not a virgin, you stupid!
Did you ask him?
Where you goin',
Rudy?
I'm in the god damn club, aren't I?
I don't believe this!
Will you speak English?
I can't understand you!
Come on!
Drunken munchkin warehouse!
Yeah, yeah, what he said!
Okay, skanks, come and get it.
Aah!
I don't believe this.
Unh!
Uhh!
Please read!
Oh, shit!
Sean, look out!
Dad!
You stay there!
My God.
Aah...
Suck on this, you son of a bitch.
Aah!
Hey, asshole.
You looked.
It's okay.
All right, let's try it again, now, shall we?
Look, you've got me upset!
Read it?
Come on, read!
Oh, my God!
I said it!
Ho ho!
All right!
You did!
I have absolutely no idea how!
I--
Where's Limbo?
We just went through some major shit, and where's the big Limbo thing?
Jesus...Christ!
Holy shit!
Kid, watch it!
Let's get him!
Let's go!
Go! Go!
Are you absolutely sure that she is...
You're not a virgin, are you?
No? No, what do you mean, no?
Well...Steve, but he doesn't count!
Doesn't count?
Aah! Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Bang.
God.
Thank you.
Told ya.
Only one way to kill a werewolf.
What?
Is she a vershion?
She? A virgin?
Yes! A virgin!
We'll use the girl!
She can't read!
She's five years old!
I'll help her!
Yah!
E.J.!
Uhh! Uhh! Unh!
Let me in, E.J.!
Let me in!
Hey! Fat Kid!
Good job.
My name... is Horace.
Don't look up.
Don't look up.
Hey! Hey, hold it right there a minute.
Hey! I said to stop right there.
Aah!

Aah!
Bogus.

Don't go away,

Please don't go!
Please!
Please don't go away,
Frankenstein!
Bye.
Mommy!
Del.
She's fine.
Hey, sweetheart.
Who's Eugene?
All right, son... where are they?
Where are the monsters?
The mummy came in my house.
Can somebody tell me what the
Sam Hell is goin' on around here?
Well, we can, sir.
Well, who are you?
We're the Monster Squad.
All right, pal!
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

Good morning, Elisa.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Reverend, thank you for the focus.
- Morning.
- It was a great sermon.
It was about three years ago.
I was the only kid in church that day.
The others were with Isaac out in the cornfield.
I didn't get to go
'cause Dad didn't like Isaac.
He was pretty smart, my dad.
After church, we went to Hansen's- just like always.
Sarah was home sick with Mom.
She'd come down with the fever real sudden.
Morning, Dave.
- Morning, Pop. How are you?
- How are the wife and Sarah?
Dad was worried, so he went to call Mom first thing.
Sarah's been better.
I'm going to call your mom, okay?
Okay.
Mr. Hansen:
I bet dad wants a cup of coffee.
- Okay, Joby, you want your usual?
- Yeah, strawberry shake.
That's when I saw
Malachai and the others.
I guess their meeting with Isaac was over.
- Hi.
- They were acting real creepy.
Francis.
- Here you go, Joby.
- Oh, thanks.
How is she?
I'm worried, Dave.
Her fever's gone from 101 to 104.
Sure.
How are you?
- May I have some cream?
- Okay.
Good coffee.
What's going on?
This young man's got a weapon.
Oh my God!
No!
Stop it!
Dave, are you listening to me?
Don't do it!
Don't do it! No!
Don't! No!
What are you kids-
It happened everywhere in Gatlin that day.
That's when Sarah started drawing these pictures.
Happy birthday!
What are you doing?
- You're crazy.
- Come on, come on!
Make a wish.
So what did you wish for?
To live happily ever after.
- Mm.
- Is that a proposal?
No... it's not.
Okay.
Well...
I guess I'll give you this anyway.
- Come on.
- What is it?
Oh, that's nice.
Turn it over.
I like this.
In honor of this special occasion, we have a birthday serenade.
- # A one, a two #
- # A one, a two #
- # A one, two, three, four! #
- # A one, two, three, four! #
# No more books and studies #
# Now I can stay out late with my buddies #
# I can do the things that I wanna do #
# 'Cause all my exams are through #?
# I can root for the Yankees from the bleachers #
# And don't have to worry about teachers #
# And I'm so glad that school is out #
# I could sing and shout #
# School is out, everybody gonna have some fun #
- # School is out #
- # Everybody gonna jump and run #
- # School is out #
- # Come on people, don't you be late #
- # School is out #
- # I just got time to take- #
# My girl out on a date... #
Yay!
You're wacko!
Holy cow!
We'd better get going.
We've got a lot of driving to do today.
Couldn't we just say,
"the hell with it"?
- Stay here for a couple of hours?
- Mm, I wish.
Starting Monday,
I've got 50 patients a day to look at.
I've got a couple of things you can look at.
Is that right?
Well...
Hello? Hello? Maid service.
Um, we'll be out in a minute.
Oh, we got to get going.
I wanna grab a quick shower before we go, okay?
You're making something out of nothing.
Right. To me it's something; to you it's nothing.
I'm just worried about this internship, okay?
I've been working for this for four years.
I know.
I do understand.
Why do you have to be such a jerk about it?
"Welcome to Nebraska."
We weren't the only ones who thought Isaac was weird.
One day Joseph told us he was running away.
He said he couldn't take it anymore.
He was pretty scared.
I wasn't.
- I'm scared!
- Me too!
There's nothing to be afraid of.
I said I'd come back for you.
I promise.
- Can't we go with you, please?
- No!
I'd never make it with you two.
- But we don't like it here.
- I said you'll be all right!
As long as nobody finds them pictures you've been drawin'.
She can't help it.
That won't matter to Isaac and Malachai.
They'll take it as a sign.
Anyways, you know crayons and drawings are forbidden... just like having that record player.
But we like it.
Isaac doesn't let us do anything!
Well, you just better mind him till I get back or else you know what happens.
You're not going through the corn, are ya?
- I can't go no other way.
- But what about-
I said it'll be all right!
Unless you tell anybody I'm gone.
- We won't.
- Cross your heart? Hope to die?
Stick a needle in your eye.
Okay, you know what that means now?
If you tell, you're gonna burn in the lake of fire for all eternity!
Make sure nobody's lookin'.
Okay! Go!
Nobody's looking!
Nobody's looking!
I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter C.
- Corn.
- Right.
So now we know... the backroads are even less interesting than the highway.
Maybe they've discovered music.
- Halleluiah!
- Halleluiah!
There are many mansions in His house.
But there's no room for the fornicator!
- Oh no room!
- No room...
- for the homosexual!
- No room!
- No room for the drug abusers!
- Oh no, no room!
Amen! Peanut butter and white bread!
There's no room for the college graduate!
No room for people who watch public television!
- No room for commitment!
- Amen!
Come on.
Here it is.
I wonder how it got in here.
Not me.
Okay now, it looks like... this one goes goes to Grand Island, and this one cuts up to the highway.
Where's this Gatlin we've been seeing signs for?
It's not on here.
What do you mean?
It's gotta be on here somewhere.
Burt, look out!
Hang on.
Let me check.
Let me check.
- Where, right there?
- Yeah.
It's just a bump.
Just try and relax.
That was an animal, right?
I got to go back there, okay?
Just stay here and try and rest.
Come on, buddy.
Oh lord.
Is... he...
Oh, yeah.
- Oh my God!
- Easy, easy, easy. Come on.
Easy.
Take it easy.
Don't look at him.
Okay, now, listen to me.
There's something very wrong here.
So I want you to go back to the car and wait for me there,
Understand? Keep all the doors locked until I get back.
- Why? Where are you going?
- I'll tell you when I get back.
- Just do what I say.
- Okay.
Burt?
Burt?!
I'm so sorry.
- Vicky, come on.
- Burt!
- Easy, calm down.
- I kneeled-
I kneeled down next to him.
He said...
It's okay.
Take it easy.
Just take it easy.
Relax.
You're okay.
You understand?
- Yeah.
- You're okay.
It's okay.
Everything's okay.
You're okay.
Me and Sarah were playing in our old house.
We played there lots.
Malachai said it was forbidden.
But I think that was 'cause nobody ever asked him to play.
When I grow up,
I'm gonna have all the money in the world.
Me too.
- You can't.
- Why not?
- Because I'm gonna have it.
- I'll get it first.
- Will not.
- Will too!
- Will not!
- Will too!
Oh yeah, how?
It's easy.
Seven.
One, two, three, four, five, six... seven.
All right, see?
Uh-uh, Joby.
How much?
13 thousand hundred dollars.
13 thousand hundred dollars?
Uh, okay,
Mm-hmm.
I thought so.
I got a great idea.
Let's pretend this guy is Isaac.
And we're gonna put him in jail.
What if he gets a get-out-of-jail-free card?
Simple as that.
What cards?
Do you think it might have been some kind of accident, like farm equipment or something?
Not a wound like that.
His throat was cut deliberately.
He was already dead when he stumbled out into the road.
Whoever killed him- do you think he saw us?
I mean, I felt like we were being watched.
It's possible.
Blood starts to coagulate in four minutes.
When I went to get the suitcase, it was still fresh.
- Then he could have been out there.
- I couldn't leave it there.
I mean, what if it holds some sort of clue?
- Let's open it.
- No.
Let's just get to a phone or a house or someplace.
Malachai took us right to Isaac.
I figured he finally talked the little squirt into punishing us for being unbelievers.
Up till then, we'd been forgiven
'cause we weren't in the corn the day He Who Walks Behind the Rows made himself known.
That bothered Malachai.
He had a lot of problems.
I found these two in one of the old homes.
They had a game and music.
And this.
They come already.
You have the gift of sight.
This is a blessing, my child.
I've seen this car upon the road.
Go to the old man.
Make sure he tells them nothing.
What about these two?
Take them back where they were.
But they had a game and music.
- They're forbidden!
- Question me not, Malachai.
I act according to His will.
Ugh, you'd think we were on the damn moon.
We haven't even seen a truck.
We'll be in Gatlin soon.
You think he lived there?
We may never know that.
I really think we should open it.
Okay.
Let's see if I can get some news.
Atone!
Only by the blood of the Lamb are we saved!
I'm getting tired of that crap!
- Ugh!
- What is it?
- Jesus Christ.
- Not in my book.
Looks like some kind of primitive folk art.
I think it's repulsive.
Sarge, how about that number six?
Oh damn it.
Better make it an eight.
Come on, come on.
We ain't got all day.
Oh, good boy, Sarge,
We'll have that transmission fixed in no time!
Then we'll get on the radiator.
Damn, this road is becoming a regular highway.
Ain't this about the third car in a month, huh?
We know what to do, don't we, boy?
You'd better put that suitcase away.
Be right back.
- Hi, we've had ourselves-
- I ain't got no gas.
- No, I don't need gas.
- I ain't got no diesel if you all need it.
No, you don't understand.
I need to use your-
You don't buy no gas, you can't use no restroom.
Your telephone.
I need to use your phone.
Telephone?!
I ain't got no telephone.
Sarge.
Sarge, you be still now.
Mister, what you want to do is to go to Hemingford.
- About 19 miles down that right fork there.
- What about Gatlin?
Gatlin? There ain't nothin' in Gatlin.
What do you mean there ain't nothing in Gatlin?
Folks in Gatlin's got religion.
They don't cotton to outsiders and probably won't have a phone either.
Sarge! Mister, I'd like to stay here and shoot the breeze with you about politics and stuff, but I got a transmission to fix.
You get on that right fork there and you'll be in Hemingford in no time.
Right.
Sarge.
I said at ease!
Yeah, thanks a lot.
Sarge!
Either that man's senile or he's been out in the sun too long.
Sarge!
Come back here!
Sarge, get back here!
I don't have time for this.
You hear me?
Come back here.
Come on.
That's an order!
Who is it?
Is that you?
What do you want?
What are you doing in there?
There really isn't that much stuff in here.
Just kid's stuff- clothes, matches, compass, pocket knife.
- I don't get it, camping stuff?
- Yeah.
Oh great.
This must be our day.
Didn't the last sign we saw say Gatlin was three miles
- and point that way?
- That's what I thought.
Did I miss a turn?
No, we've been going straight.
Somebody's been messing with these signs then.
- Hemingford's gotta be straight ahead.
- Yeah.
Must have been the wind.
Those latches ain't worth a damn.
Blow over in a bad fart.
I never told them nothing.
I swear it.
I kept our bargain just like always.
Jesus Christ.
Gatlin! What do they have a monopoly on road signs?
What about Hemingford?
For people who don't like visitors, they sure do advertise enough.
Over there.
Of course, it's the wind.
Why did you have to go after them, Sarge?
Why you bastards.
You can't do this to me.
I know you're in here.
Come on.
Come on!
I can smell you, you stinkin' little skunks.
Come on!
You murdering little devils.
Come on!
What was that?
That probably was just my golf bag.
- Are you sure?
- What do you mean am I sure?
God, this isn't even a road.
- We're never gonna get out of here.
- We will too, now stop it!
Sorry.
- Just tell me where we are.
- I don't know.
We're right back where we started from.
We never should have listened to that old fool.
Hemingford's 19 miles.
Gatlin's only three.
I don't care how much religion they've got, we're going there right now.
Don't ever show up in my emergency room, buddy.
Behold.
A dream did come to me in the night.
And the Lord did show all this to me.
Praise God!
Praise the Lord!
A time of tribulation has come.
A test is at hand.
- The final test.
- What has the Lord commanded?
In the dream, the Lord did come to me
And He was a shape.
It was He Who Walks
Behind the Rows.
And I did fall on my knees in terror, and hide my eyes, lest the fierceness of
His face strike me dead!
And He told me all that has since happened.
He said,
"Joseph has taken his things and fled this happy place, because the worship of Me is no more upon him.
So take you his life and spill his blood."
- He did?
- Yeah.
"But let not the flesh pollute the corn.
- Cast him instead upon the road."
- And so it was done!
Joseph the betrayer was cast out.
And He Who Walks
Behind the Rows did say,
"I will send outlanders amongst you, a man and a woman.
And these outlanders will be unbelievers and profaners of the holy."
I wish Isaac never came here.
But he's always been here, just like He Who Walks
Behind the Rows.
"And the man shall sorely test you.
For he has great power,
Even greater than that of the blue man!"
The blue man.
Yes, the blue man.
And just as the blue man was offered up unto Him, so shall be the unbelievers.
Make sacrifice unto Him.
Bring Him the blood of the outlanders.
Praise God! Praise the Lord!
Praise God!
Praise the Lord!
Praise God! Praise the Lord!
Praise God!
Praise the Lord!
Praise God! Praise the Lord!
Let's get out of here.
It looks like a swinging place.
I guess nobody told them we were coming.
I hope not.
God, I don't see anybody.
Town hall.
Grocery store.
Hansen's Cafe.
Let's see if they've got a phone, huh?
Unless a ghost is using it.
What is it with this corn?
You got me.
Phew.
It's dead.
Just like everything else around here.
Yuck!
- A rat.
- Yeah.
Just your ordinary coffee shop rat.
Now can we get out of here, please?
Hey.
Hey hey, wait a minute.
Come back here!
Come on, Vicky.
Hurry up, I don't want to lose them.
So what are you gonna do if you catch them?
Ask them where we could find help, what else?
- They cut off that way.
- Okay.
Damn it. Where'd they go?
Look, we're already in the car.
Why don't we go on to Hemingford?
It'll take us 20 minutes.
We just found people.
Yeah, three kids who tried to steal our car.
There's something very strange about this town.
Maybe you're right.
We'd be better off in a bigger town anyway.
- The size of Seattle.
- Yeah.
- Over there.
- What?
I just saw a door open and close.
I didn't see anything.
Let's check it out.
Why? I thought we were going!
Settle down.
Jeez.
- Don't patronize me, Burt.
- I'm not patronizing you.
I just want to see if somebody's there.
Hello?
Anybody home?
We've had an accident and we need to use your phone.
Okay?
Now can we go?
Burt, this is somebody's house!
I know, I just want to use their phone.
Hello?
Gross.
I'm going to check out back.
I found the phone.
It matches the decor perfectly.
This is three years old.
I don't understand what's going on here.
Well, can we go?
Burt.
Hello?
Is anybody here?
Don't be afraid.
We didn't mean to scare you.
Hi.
- What's your name?
- Sarah.
Oh, Sarah.
That's a beautiful name.
This is Burt and I'm Vicky.
Are you here alone, Sarah?
Do you live here?
You just come here to play?
Are your mommy and daddy around?
They're in the cornfield.
What are they doing there?
All the grown-ups are there.
Are they working there or are they having a meeting?
No, Isaac put them there.
Who's Isaac?
Come on, sweetheart.
Tell us who Isaac is.
Our leader.
Leader of what?
Of everybody.
Of course.
Listen, could you take us to Isaac?
- Huh-uh.
- Why not?
He's scary.
Look, Sarah, it's very important that we speak to some grown-ups as soon as possible.
We're wasting our time here, Vicky.
Well, give her a chance.
I'm gonna go look at the town hall.
Why?
Because we have a murder to report.
And we're standing here talking in circles wasting our time.
Maybe she can help.
Well, fine, then you stay here with her.
Listen, things just aren't happening fast enough.
So I'm gonna leave you the car.
I won't be gone very long.
If anybody comes, just honk, okay?
Are we safe?
Yeah, it's a little weird here, but it's safe.
I'll be back.
So looks like it's just you and me.
What were you doing here by yourself?
Just playing records?
Come on, you can tell me.
- Drawing
- Drawing.
What's so secret about drawing?
I'm not supposed to.
You're not supposed to draw?
Who says?
Isaac?
Malachai.
Malachai?
Well, I'll tell you what.
Why don't you draw me a picture
And we won't tell Isaac or Malachai or anybody?
- How's that sound?
- Okay.
- So how's it coming, huh?
- Fine.
- What did you draw?
- You.
You did?
Could I see?
What is this?
Burt?
Burt, is that you?
Is somebody here?
Who are you?
What do you want?
We want to give you peace.
Seize her.
Come on, get her.
Come out of there.
Sarah!
No!
No!
Burt! No!
Are we safe?
It's weird here, but it's safe.
Vicky.
Help me!
Where are you taking me?
Burt!
Burt! No!
Vicky!
Sarah, what happened here, huh?
What happened?
Where's Vicky?
You've gotta think.
Now think.
What happened to her, please?
Does He speak to you, Isaac?
He speaks to me always.
But today He is displeased.
He is displeased with you, Malachai.
What have I done?
Question Him not in vain.
Do you not know you did sacrificed
Joseph without an offering?
And did you not spill the blood of the old man when his oil and gasoline were still useful to us?
We have our own fuel now from the corn.
Show not your pride, Malachai.
We have not enough.
Maybe He is displeased we have not offered Him Sarah and Job.
Sarah has the gift of sight.
She warned us of the coming of the interlopers.
Question not my judgment,
Malachai.
I am the giver of His word.
Go you and bring me the husband.
I must offer them tonight when Amos leaves.
Sarah, come on.
Tell me what happened to her, please.
Sarah, look at me.
Now think.
- Malachai.
- What?
- Malachai.
- Who's Malachai? What do you mean?
No.
Vicky?
Oh my God!
Kill kill kill kill...
Now the blood of Amos will be shared!
Stop it!
Stop that!
- What?
- Hold the outlander!
What the hell's going on here?
Are you crazy?
What do you think you're doing?
My passage, it's my birthday.
You got a pretty sick way of celebrating it, pal.
- Listen, I-
- Silence, interloper!
Your presence does profane this holy place.
He will reckon with you!
That's terrific.
I don't know who he is, but maybe he'd like to discuss the medical side of what's going on here with me.
- It's as it should be.
- Amos!
It's as it is written.
Speak no more to him!
He is an unbeliever.
Hurry, get Isaac.
No, wait.
Bring Malachai.
So what do you mean,
"as it is written"? Written where?
What, in this?
You rewriting the whole thing orjust the parts that suit your needs?
Back off, fellas.
Sit down!
What do we have here?
19, 19 year- what is this?
These people all died so young.
Not die. We go to Him
- on the first night of our 19th year.
- YEAH!
Who the hell's him?
He Who Walks
Behind the Rows.
Malachai comes!
- Seize him!
- Get him!
Back off!
Stay back.
No!
Come on, hurry up.
Get him. Do not let him escape!
Get him!
Kill him!
- Let's go. Get him!
- Where is he? Come on!
He went around the corner!
There he is.
Go get him, you guys. Go that way.
He's getting away!
I need your help.
Come on.
Come on!
Help me, help me!
Outlander!
Hey!
- He's here.
- There he is.
Come on.
Get him.
- Got you this time.
- This isn't a game, understand?
Back off.
Get out of here.
Outlander!
Go get him!
Down the alley.
Damn it!
Check the door.
Check the doors.
You guys, go back up the alley.
You, over there.
You two, follow me.
Shit.
Damn it.
Psst.
Hey, mister.
I know a place to hide.
But we gotta hurry.
- Who are you?
- Job.
Come on.
Stop asking questions.
Come on.
Will you come on?
Careful.
Hey, don't be a scaredy cat.
- Come on. It's only me and Sarah.
- Sarah?
Yeah, my sister.
Isn't this neat?
My dad built it for when the communists launch their first strike.
I don't think it's the communists we have to worry about.
Don't worry.
Nobody knows about this place.
It's secret.
- Are those guys friends of yours?
- No way.
They listen to Isaac and Malachai.
Who are Isaac and Malachai?
Isaac started the whole thing.
If he hadn't had come, this would never have happened.
When he was young, he was a preacher, so everybody believed him.
They thought he had great spirit.
I thought he was weird, huh, Sarah?
We must sacrifice them both tonight.
Amos will satisfy Him.
We need the woman.
She'll bring the man to us.
No, he must be taken without her.
We cannot remove her from this place. It is holy.
We will bring the Lord two by using one.
Do not blaspheme,
Malachai!
You know not the laws.
He speaks them only to me.
I think not, Isaac.
You're the one who's lost favor with Him.
He's the god of blood and sacrifice, not ceremony.
Ah, sacrilege!
Down on your knees, heretic!
Shut your mouth, Isaac.
You've grown prideful and apart from us.
Oh my gosh. Oh no.
He Who Walks Behind the Rows will decide your fate.
Don't just sit there.
Seize him!
Punish him!
Cut him down! I command you!
I am the word and the giver of His laws.
Disobedience to me is disobedience to Him.
Do it now or your punishment shall be a thousand times a thousand deaths.
Each more horrible than the last.
They are tired of your talk, Isaac.
I have shown them what I can do.
Cut the woman down.
Put Isaac in her place.
You will see how the Lord favors you.
No, you dare not.
You blaspheme.
He will punish you.
The god of hell will devour you.
All of you! No!
When my dad wouldn't get up,
I ran from Hansen's to get Officer Hotchkiss.
But I was too late.
Why, what happened to him?
He got away... that time.
Then he went down to the barn after he talked to the minister.
The minister?
What happened to the minister?
Malachai.
Outlander!
Outlander!
Get over there.
He's gonna come. Get over there.
- You come with me down this street.
- Outlander!
Outlander!
We have your woman.
She still lives.
Outlander, maybe you don't hear so well.
Burt!
Outlander, her blood will spill unless you give yourself up.
We won't wait much longer.
Night is coming.
Night is His time.
Outlander!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on, outlander!
Come on!
Outlander!
Are you looking for that lady?
Yeah, you know where she is?
- They took her out to the clearing.
- What clearing? Where?
In the cornfield.
- Are you sure?
- Of course, I'm sure.
- I followed them like I followed you.
- Show me.
- Okay.
- Come on, let's go.
Okay.
Quiet.
Come on.
Follow me to the barn.
Careful.
I'm ready to celebrate my birthday.
Malachai, He will not forgive you!
None of you will be forgiven!
All of you shall feel His wrath!
We have a surprise for you, Amos.
You morons. Don't you understand what he's trying to do?
Isaac's going to keep you company.
He Who Walks Behind the Rows will decide your fate.
I am the word and the giver of His laws!
This is the end!
Come on.
Come in through here.
You can see everything from here.
Okay, you two.
You stay here and wait for me, all right?
But if anything happens to me, you get to Hemingford as fast as you can.
You get on that road and don't get off, understand?
Go past the irrigation pump.
It's him.
He's come for me.
He's come to welcome me.
Go to him, Amos!
I'm here, Lord!
I'm ready.
Take me now, Lord.
Your will, Lord.
Thy message.
I did as You commanded.
I was good.
I swear it.
I did everything
You wanted.
No!
It's the outlander!
Come on, go.
Run to the barn.
Get him!
Get him!
Help Malachai!
- Get him.
- He came back.
Vicky, get out of here.
Was this how it was with your parents, huh?
Was it?
Just because some self-proclaimed holy man said this is what
God commands?
So?
What kind of a god tells his children to kill their parents, huh?
Answer me that, buddy.
Did you ever hear of that before Isaac?
Did you?
I can't believe you're this blind.
Maybe you've been listening to these holy rollers so long, it's all starting to sound the same.
Well, it's not!
- What's he talking about?
- Any religion... without love and compassion... is false!
It's a lie!
Did he kill Malachai?
Is this what you want, huh?
Is this what He commands?
I don't think so.
Get him.
Stop him.
Get him.
Malachai!
Oh my God! Isaac!
He wants you too...
Malachai!
He wants you too.
Use these!
Should we board this up?
- Vicky?
- Burt?
Over here.
You're hurt.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Get down.
Get down.
Joby, get some help and get those doors closed, quick.
- Peter, Robert, come on.
- What do we do?
I don't know.
If I knew what it was,
I could tell you.
It's He Who Walks
Behind the Rows.
What if we tried to run for it and make it to the road?
I think we're safer here for now.
Joby, has anybody ever tried to hurt the monster?
Any of the adults?
The parents before they were killed?
The blue man.
Who's the blue man?
What did he do?
Officer Hotchkiss.
I told you.
He came down here after he talked to the minister.
He was reading a page torn out of the Bible
- and he was working with the still.
- Wait a minute.
Why was he reading out of the Bible?
What was it?
Do you know?
You have it?
Hurry up.
Where is it?
It's all Malachai's fault!
"And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever."
What's that supposed to mean?
Job, what was the blue man doing at the still?
He hooked the hose up to it and was trying to roll it out.
- What stopped him?
- Malachai.
"Lake of fire." Fire!
He was going to burn the field.
Oh, yes.
The gasohol. The still.
- How?
- Never mind, never mind.
You kids, get me as many hoses as you can find, quick!
Job and Sarah, find me a bottle, a glass one.
A pop bottle.
Quick, move.
Vicky, come here.
- Over here.
- I can't find anything.
It doesn't fit.
There's gotta be a connector around here somewhere.
Try these.
Get somebody to hold this on tight.
- Okay!
- Hang on to it.
You got one, good.
Vicky, see if you can find me a thick rag.
Joby, come here.
Hey, that's not a rag.
Sheesh.
Okay.
Now get them to hold onto that tight.
- Open it up when I get out there, all right?
- All right.
Burt, be careful.
- I love you, Vicky.
- I wish we'd never done this.
Okay.
What are you doing here?
Get back to the barn. Hurry up.
Go on, move. Now.
Excuse me.
Joby, get that valve.
Quick.
Joby, do you know how to run this thing?
- Crank it.
- What?
Crank it.
Push the button at the top.
Yeah.
All right.
- Get the bottle.
- Okay.
Come here.
Block the wind.
Joby! Joby!
Come back here.
You'll get killed.
Joby!
Run. Come on.
Run, Joby.
Here's the bottle!
Throw it.
Throw right this time.
Throw it.
Throw it.
Burt!
- Joby!
- Burt!
Joby!
- Vicky! Vicky!
- Sarah!
Joby!
Joby!
Look! Look!
Come on, come on.
Let's go.
- Is He dead?
- I think so.
- Then why are we still running?
- Just keep going.
Where did you get this guy?
Well, Hemingford's 19 miles, right?
You mean walk?
Sure.
Burt, are you sure you're strong enough?
I'm okay.
What about you?
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'll make it.
I got a great doctor.
You better believe it.
Jealous?
What are we gonna do with these two little munchkins, huh?
Oh, I don't know.
You guys want to come live with us for a couple days?
- Hmm?
- How about a week?
- Okay.
- How about a month?
No.
All right.
All right.
I'll grab the map.
- Ever been to Seattle?
- What's Seattle?
Interloper!
No!
You must die.
Oh, boy.
Oh, she's out cold.
What are we gonna do now?
Send her a get-well card from Seattle.
Let's get the hell out of here.
The tank itself...
...was unusual in that it was vertical...
...and looked like an old boiler. inside the tank the subject wore a heavy glass bubble...
...and you would have thought the whole contraption uncomfortable to say the least. it was, however, effective. of the 23 students tested, only two found the experience unpleasant.
Some even called it exhilarating.
A number of students hallucinated.
Dr. Jessup found the encephalographic evidence especially interesting.
And one Saturday afternoon, in April 1967...
...he decided to try the experience for himself.
Arthur. Hey, Arthur.
Are you there?
Can you hear me, Arthur?
Arthur, answer me.
Is that it? You want me to come in and get you out? i want to get a look at those EEG tracings.
How do you feel?
Not bad.
I hallucinated like a son of a bitch.
A variety of dream states, mystical states...
...a lot of religious allegory, mostly out of Revelation.
You were in there close to five hours.
It felt like an hour.
I'd like to try that myself sometime.
You should. You'll like it.
Did we have any communication?
Sure. I kept checking you out like you told me to.
How did I respond?
Very orderly.
At one point you were crying.
You mean, actually crying?
You were sobbing.
There were tears on your face.
When I asked you what was going on, you said you were...
...re-experiencing your father's death.
Did you make notes?
It's all there.
I'd like to try this again next week. Do you think you could make it again next week?
What are we looking for?
I don't know, yet.
There's really very little literature on this kind of research.
There are some good people in the field:
Tart, Ornstein and Deikman...
...but most of it is radical-hip stuff, drug-culture apologias.
Obviously, the first thing to do is set up some sensible methodology...
...study these experiences under controlled laboratory conditions.
It won't interfere with the work we're doing with Hobart.
What are we getting into?
Sensory deprivation? Isolation studies?
I mean, where will we be going with the tank stuff?
We're not writing up a grant.
Strictly bootlegging, just for kicks.
We've got the use of this tank.
Let's play with it.
Let's find out where it takes us.
It's fascinating stuff.
I think we ought to get into it.
I didn't even know they had one of those isolation tanks at New York Hospital.
Must be some guy in the Psychology Department...
...doing sensory deprivation studies.
What's Jessup doing with it?
You've got me. He's been taking students out of his classes and testing them.
He's been doing this for three, four months.
Did you know...
...Jessup was into this kind of stuff?
Not until you just told me.
What do you want?
How long are you going to let it ring?
It's okay, I'll get it.
He's the last guy in the world I figured...
...to be screwing around with anything as flaky as altered states of consciousness.
Let's face it.
Jessup is pretty flaky himself.
That's him.
Arthur says you're very shy.
He wants me to draw you out.
Draw me out?
That doesn't sound like Arthur.
Well, what he actually said was you were a high-handed, arrogant prick.
A little nuts, but brilliant...
...and that if I ever got you talking,
I would find you fascinating.
That sounds more like Arthur.
He says you're doing some work with him and Alan Hobart at Payne-Whitney.
What sort of work?
Toxic metabolite stuff.
We're replicating Heath's and Friedhoff's strategies...
...trying to find maverick substances specific to schizophrenia.
I think we're chasing our tails.
What do you do?
I'm a physical anthropologist.
I'm sweating out my dissertation.
Where?
Columbia.
Holloway, and that bunch.
You're kind of young for a Ph. D., aren't you?
I'm 24.
That's still pretty good.
I didn't get my Ph. D. until I was 25.
I'm supposed to be a whiz kid.
I'm a whiz kid, too.
Anthropology seems to attract good-looking women.
So you don't think schizophrenia can be reduced to a single etiological agent?
I'm not even sure it's a disease.
You think madness is simply another state of consciousness?
There's a body of evidence to support that.
You don't like to talk about your work, do you?
As a rule, no.
I'm interested in interior experiences, especially the religious experience.
The only reason I'm working with schizophrenics now...
...is the religious experience is so significant in schizophrenia.
There's only so much you can do with animals.
I worked with monkeys...
...but they can't tell you what goes on in their consciousness.
You need human beings for that.
You can't ablate human beings, nor stick electrodes in their skulls...
...so I have to use a trance-inducing technique...
...and the isolation tank seemed the least risky.
And I'd like to go home with you tonight.
Would that be all right with you?
I've got a roommate.
We'll be confined to the living-room couch.
What's wrong with the living-room couch?
You tend to slip off a lot.
I'm sure we'll manage.
I'm sure we will.
So, whenever you want to go there, you let me know.
How about right now?
What are you thinking about?
God...
...Jesus, crucifixions.
As a rule, do you usually think about
Christ and crucifixions under sexual stress?
When I was nine years old,
I used to see visions...
...visions of saints and angels, even Christ himself.
Of course I don't do that anymore...
...not since I was 16.
Were your parents religious?
Anything but.
My father was an aeronautical engineer.
My mother, a clinical psychologist.
What happened?
I mean, how did a little kid who saw visions of Christ turn into a physiologist...
...teaching at the Cornell Medical College?
I stopped believing.
It was very dramatic.
My father died a protracted and painful death of cancer.
I was 16 years old and very fond of my father.
I used to race to the hospital every day after school...
...and sit in his room doing my homework.
He was very heavily sedated.
The last few weeks he was in coma.
One day I thought
I heard him say something.
I got up and leaned over him...
...my ear an inch away from his lips.
"Did you say something, Pop?"
Then I heard the word he was desperately trying to say, a soft hiss of a word.
He was saying...
"... terrible..."
"... terrible."
So the end was terrible, even for the good people like my father.
So the purpose of all our suffering was just more suffering.
By dinner time, I had dispensed with God altogether. I never saw another vision.
I haven't told anybody about this in 10 years.
I'm telling you now because I want you to know...
...what sort of a nut you might be getting mixed up with.
Arthur was right.
You are a fascinating bastard.
Well, it's settled.
Metcalfe spoke to Spencer again this morning and it's definite. The job's mine.
I'll be in Nairobi doing my post-doc work July and August...
...and in September,
I'll be teaching at Harvard.
Terrific.
It looks like we'll both be teaching at Harvard in September.
Looks that way.
You can't get any tidier than that, can you?
We're going to be together in Boston and I think we should get married.
You know, of course,
I'm supposed to be at least a little bit nuts.
A little bit?
You're an unmitigated madman!
You don't have to tell me how weird you are. I know how weird you are!
I'm the girl in your bed the past two months.
Even sex is a mystical experience for you.
You carry on like a flagellant, which can be very nice...
...but I sometimes wonder if it's me that's being made love to.
I feel like I'm being harpooned by some raging monk in the act of receiving God.
And you are a Faust freak, Eddie.
You'd sell your soul to find the great Truth.
Well, human life doesn't have great truths.
We're born in doubt. We spend our lives persuading ourselves we're alive.
And one way we do that is we love each other, like I love you.
I can't imagine living without you.
So let's get married.
If it turns out to be a disaster, it'll be a disaster.
We'll shake hands and say goodbye.
He's giving her dimethyltryptamine.
It takes effect in about a minute and she'll trip out for about half an hour.
Do you feel different now?
Less anxious?
Much less.
Do you have any special feelings?
I feel...
...like my heart is being touched by Christ.
There's a lot of religious delusion among acute schizophrenics.
Some guys say schizophrenics are physically different from the rest of us.
It's almost as if they were trying to change their physical selves to...
...adapt to their schizophrenic image of themselves.
All right, we'll get married, since it's that important to you.
I'm not comfortable with women...
...and I'm not likely to find anyone half as remarkable as you again.
I think I can make a reasonably good husband.
I don't want to lose you, you see.
I suppose that's the closest thing to a declaration of love I'll ever get out of you.
Am I really that weird in bed?
Sometimes.
Shall I try to change?
No, I kind of like it.
- Daddy, I'm tired.
- We'll give the little lady a ride!
Hey, Mason, be careful.
How you doin', Eddie?
Hi, Mason. How about a beer?
- If I didn't see this, I wouldn't believe it!
- You were supposed to come next week!
Look at the family man!
Oh, Eddie, you look so good!
I don't believe it.
Not again? When did this happen?
Well, it's a long story.
Have you found a place yet?
We got a nice little place near Huntington Field.
We moved to San Francisco seven years ago.
Arthur is going to teach at Boston U.
I can't believe it's been seven years.
I hear you just got associate professor.
You guys must be loaded!
We've got a place in Maine you can use for the summer.
I'm going to Africa again in June.
Eddie will be in Mexico.
Do you know a guy named Eccheverria,
University of Mexico?
Says he worked with you.
Sure. A very bright young guy.
He's here at the Botanical Museum.
We'll all have to get together.
I'm going back to Mexico with him in June.
What's in Mexico?
Eccheverria's got this witch doctor down there, the Hinchi Indians.
They're an isolated tribe in Central Mexico who still practice...
...the ancient Toltec rituals, sacred mushroom ceremonies, that kind of thing.
Apparently they use some kind of hallucinatory drug...
...that is supposed to evoke a common experience in all users.
Maggie has fallen asleep on the couch.
Will you take care of her?
Did you ever get into an isolation tank since New York?
No. Did you?
No, but I just found out there's one here at the Medical School.
I didn't think anybody was doing those kind of studies anymore.
We did some interesting stuff in that tank...
...in New York for the few months we played around with it.
Maybe when I get back from Mexico we'll get into it again.
Why not?
A terrific housekeeper she's not.
They're getting a divorce, you know.
- I don't know if they're getting...
- What are you talking about?
She and the kids are moving to Cambridge.
That's why this place is such a mess.
They're moving her stuff into storage tomorrow.
Then she's going off to Africa for a year with the kids.
And he's going to Mexico.
When she comes back, she's going to live in Cambridge and he's staying here.
It's he who wants the divorce, not her.
I'm surprised they stayed together this long.
When did all this happen?
She just told me five minutes ago.
What about the letters she kept writing us about how happy they were?
Don't ask me. She's still crazy about him.
He's still crazy.
Sylvia just told me you're getting a divorce.
We're getting separated.
We probably won't get around to the divorce until next year.
I know it's none of my business, but why?
You're married to a great woman who adores you.
My God, if anybody has it made, you have.
You're a respected and admired figure...
...a full professor on the faculty of the Harvard Medical School.
For God's sake, is that how you imagine me? A respected and admired figure?
A devoted father? A loving husband?
Well, I've also published nearly two papers a year for the last seven years...
...and not a fundamental piece of work in the lot.
I sit around the living rooms of other young married faculty members...
...talking infantile masturbation, who's sucking up to the head of the department...
...whose tenure is hanging by a thread.
Emily is content to go on with this life.
She insists she's in love with me, whatever that is.
What she means is she prefers the senseless pain...
...we inflict on each other to the pain...
...we would otherwise inflict on ourselves...
...but I'm not afraid of that solitary pain.
If I don't strip myself of all this clatter and clutter and ridiculous ritual...
...I shall go out of my fucking mind!
Does that answer your question, Arthur?
What question was that?
You asked me why I was getting divorced.
Listen, it's your life.
I'm sorry I even asked.
Why don't I call Eccheverria and we'll all go out and have some dinner?
As a matter of fact, Eduardo, my year in India was disappointing.
No matter how you slice it...
...yoga's a state-specific technology operating in the service of...
...an a piori belief system...
We scientists have a moral obligation to the public as well as to our own research.
It just never occurred to baboons...
...that they could shorten that time to five minutes if they used a stick.
Originally, man was just another savanna-living primate like the baboon.
What dignifies the yogic practices is the belief system itself is not truly religious.
There is no Buddhist god, per se.
It is the Self, the individual Mind, that contains immortality and ultimate Truth.
What is not religious about that?
You've simply replaced God with the original Self.
Yes, but we've localized it.
Now I know where the Self is.
It's in our own minds.
It's a form of human energy.
Our atoms are six billion years old.
We've got six billion years of memory in our minds.
Memory is energy! It doesn't disappear!
It's still in there!
There's a physiological pathway to our earlier consciousnesses.
There has to be.
It's in the goddamned limbic system.
Jessup, you're a whacko!
What's whacko about it?
I'm a man in search of his true Self.
How archetypically American can you get?
Everybody's looking for their true selves.
We're all trying to fulfill ourselves...
...understand ourselves, get in touch with ourselves...
...face the reality of ourselves, explore ourselves, expand ourselves.
Ever since we dispensed with God...
...we've got nothing but ourselves to explain this meaningless horror of life.
You're whacko.
Well, I think that the true Self...
...that original Self, that first Self, is a real, mensurate, quantifiable thing...
...tangible and incarnate...
...and I'm going to find the fucker.
What are their chemical properties?
Are they safe?
The mushrooms are almost certainly amanita muscaria...
...a very powerful psychedelic and a little dangerous.
It contains belladonna, alkaloids...
...atropine, scopolamine.
The sinicuiche plant is highly regarded...
...among a number of Indian tribes.
I've seen it as far north as Chihuahua.
The Indians say it evokes old memories...
...event ancient ones...
...and the Hinchis call it The First Flower.
The first in the sense of primordial?
Yes.
In the sense of the most ancient.
I'd like to try it.
Do you think they would let me join in their ritual?
Well, they seem like agreeable people.
Est todo bien para ti participar en la ceremonia.
He says it's all right for you to participate in their ceremony.
Ask him what kind of an experience
I can expect.
Are they gathering these mushrooms for the ritual?
No, they're being harvested for next year.
Qué clase de experiencia puede esperar mi amigo?
Su alma regresar a su primera alma.
Your soul will return to the First Soul.
Ask him what this First Soul will look like.
?Cómo es la primera alma?
Es la ateria increada.
It is Unborn Stuff.
Entonces, usted se lanzará en el vacio...
Then you will propel into the void.
Usted verá una mancha.
You will see a spot.
La mancha se convertiráen una grieta.
The spot will become a crack.
Esta es la Grieta Entre la Nada...
This is the Crack Between the Nothing...
De esta Nada saldr su Alma increada.
...and out of this Nothing will come your Unborn Soul.
Digale que extienda la palma de la mano.
He wants you to hold the root.
Put out your hand with your palm up.
Are you all right?
We only have their word I killed a lizard.
You didn't see it and I have no recollection of it!
This whole hideous business is just a joke...
...the Indians have played on me to make the gringo look like a fool!
Look, you asked me what happened and I told you!
You drank the mixture and you went outside.
After a while there was a scream and some dogs were barking.
I shouted after you.
The screaming stopped.
The brujo yelled at me to come back.
Oh, bullshit!
Then why did you ask the brujo to give you the mixture to take back to Boston?
I thought I'd like Arthur to analyze, maybe synthesize, it.
The noise is stupefying.
The sun became black...
...as sack cloth.
The full moon became like blood.
Then a great mountain burning with fire...
...was thrown into the sea.
Then the beast ascends from the bottomless pit.
The angel of the bottomless pit.
His name is...
...Abaddon.
He's off the wall!
Are you okay?
Get this stuff! It's new!
It's deafening! The noise is deafening!
Can you hear me above this noise?
The most unbelievable thing I've seen!
I'm watching the birth agony of a mountain!
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?
I'm fine. Really, I'm fine.
Do you want me to bring you down now?
What happens now?
He's blacked out.
These blackouts can get pretty freaky.
Sometimes they last as long as four hours.
When he comes out of it, he's as chipper as a bird, but he doesn't remember a thing.
Just how dangerous is this stuff he brought back from Mexico?
I didn't say dangerous, just said it was weird.
It hangs around too long...
...and what's really screwy is it heads straight for the brain.
Well, I don't believe this.
You guys are shooting up with an untested drug that stacks up in the brain...
...and works in the nucleus of the cell and you don't call that dangerous?
For the record, we don't actually shoot up.
- Eddie drinks a 10-milligram...
- It will stop now!
You guys are supposed to be reputable scientists...
...not two kids in the dorm freaking out on Mexican mushrooms!
Why do you think I called you for?
Let's see you stop him.
This ain't LSD, goddamnit!
This is no serotonin antagonist you're drinking!
How many grams of that stuff you think you've got in you?
Two? Three?
You could be working up one hell of a case of cancer...
...with all the antimetabolites in you.
The Hinchis have been drinking that stuff for centuries with no incidence of cancer.
Fuck the Hinchi Indians!
You don't know anything about those mushrooms!
They seem to have fantastic staying powers!
We've shot up at least 30 rats with that stuff.
Some of them have a whopping load in them...
...and none of them have been noticeably affected.
Where are we going?
We were going to get something to eat.
Eddie wants to show me an isolation tank.
Isolation tank! You guys get flakier every time I talk to you!
I thought all that isolation tank stuff went out in the '60s...
...with Timothy Leary and all them other gurus!
Will you shut up for a minute and let somebody else say something?
What happens during these blackout periods is...
...you get the feeling of phenomenal acceleration...
...like you're being shot out over millions, billions of years.
Time simply obliterates.
You sense the hallucination is going on, but you get no images.
I want to break through that blackout barrier.
I want to know what those images are that I know are going on but I can't see.
We can't raise the dosage of the drug because we're close to toxic levels now.
The only way to intensify the experience is...
...to take the 200 milligrams along with the tank.
There's more I'd like to do to that drug before you take it again.
I'd like to do a half-life determination.
- That would take us a year!
- I'd like to know the transport system.
I'd like to find some analogues.
This Mexican stuff is an extraordinary substance...
...and every instinct I have tells me
I'm onto something hot here...
...and another 200 milligrams isn't going to kill anybody.
There it is.
Oh, it's horizontal.
It's smaller than the one we had in New York.
If they're doing sleep studies, it must be...
I don't think anybody's used it in years, but I checked it out yesterday and it works.
It won't take a week to get this place cleaned.
You could get your ass in a sling...
...if it ever gets out you're using an untested drug on human subjects.
Don't worry.
Nothing's going to happen to me.
Let's get a quick hamburger.
I'm seeing one of my students tonight.
All right!
Do what you want to do.
I think you're both irresponsible as hell!
Don't call me and tell me you're worried about Eddie putting all this shit into him!
I'm telling you, don't you put any more of that shit into him...
...until you know a hell of a lot more about it!
I've offered you the use of my lab and all the rats you can cut!
That's as much as I want to be implicated in your dumb experiments!
Go get your own dumb hamburger.
I've already got my own date
I'm an hour late for!
I already did these first three.
You do the rest.
Couldn't resist, right?
Well, somebody's got to keep his eye on you two sorcerers.
What have you got in there, some kind of salt solution?
Ten percent magnesium sulfate, for buoyancy.
Weird, man.
One, two, three, four. one, two, three, four.
Okay, you're fine.
Wednesday, January 7th, 4:28 P. M.
Hey, this is terrific!
He went into theta like a shot.
No spindling, nothing.
Grasslands, savannas. i feel...
...i am actually alive and inside this landscape.
A density of woodlands about a mile away.
Beyond that, mountains that seem to be smoking.
Newly born mountains,
Cenozoic, latter Tertiary. i'm in an edge-area.
Utter tranquility, but alive.
Life in the trees. Life in the sedge. oh, my God...
...the birth of man. That's got to be it! y God! There it is...
...a proto-human.
The first, and the original truly human form...
...tiny, perhaps 4 feet high, completely furred...
...chimp-like, but erect.
No knuckle walking. Shorter arms.
He's moving along so gracefully.
There's two, three of them.
Bipedal, tiny, little furred humanoid creatures...
...a chunk of lava in their hands...
...stalking or hunting something.
For Christ's sake.
Are you okay, Eddie? i'm becoming one of them. i'm no longer observing. i'm one of them.
Killing something, a goat. i'm killing...
...i'm eating...
...i'm eating the blood, hot flesh of a goat.
Are you okay?
Beautiful.
Do you want to come down?
It sounded like he was having a bad trip to me.
Some of these tank trips can get pretty creepy.
What the hell was that?
Are you okay?
Beautiful.
Do you want to stop this?
- Do you want me to leave you alone?
- Yeah.
I thought you said these things don't last more than four hours.
It's a quarter to nine.
He's coming out.
I don't like being out of contact for these long periods of time.
I think he's in shock.
He must have had a seizure, hit his head or something.
What do you want blood tests for?
What does he say?
"Buccal smear, blood for a karyotype...
"... also pictures for the Goodman and Sarich lab.
"Picture of my neck. Now, before I...
"... reconstitute."
Before he what?
Before he reconstitutes.
Then take his damn blood, and maybe he'll let me have a look at him.
Do you mind if I examine your neck for a minute?
Any masses?
Stop talking shit!
Are you trying to say your dumb hallucination has externalized?
What did he write?
"Not common aphasia.
"Time-space, fallout from the hallucination."
You are a fucking flake, Jessup.
Get dressed. I'm taking you to the Brigham...
...and do a complete workup on you.
You are a very sick dude, you dumb son of a bitch.
I'll look down your throat, do some skull films...
...get a CAT scan, maybe even an arteriogram, and I'd like...
...an unbiased eye to look at those EEG tracings.
What does he say?
"X-ray! "
All right, finish up with him and let's get him over to X-ray.
Be right back. is it possible it's purely mechanical?
Well, if it isn't neurological, it's got to be mechanical.
I'd like some plain films of this guy's neck.
A PA, a lateral and oblique.
I'm backed up to my ass!
Just take the damn pictures!
This is an emergency!
Might be a TIA.
I guess we'd better not tell Eddie he had...
...blood all over his face when he came out of the tank. He'll claim it was...
...goat's blood from that goat he was eating in his hallucination.
You know, you're really getting as weird as he is!
What do you think happened?
He's not the type for hysterical conversion, so I'm thinking seizure.
He came out of that tank in a fugue state and had blood all over his face.
He must have had a seizure while in the tank...
...bit his lip while convulsing and is postictally aphasic.
I thought maybe he had a vascular insult, a stroke, a flipped embolus...
...but neurologically he's intact, so I'm thinking seizure now.
Now you just take it easy.
None of us are so terrific at reading X-rays.
What are you looking for?
Just put these in an envelope.
Who's reading tonight in Radiology?
Dr. Wissenschaft.
I want someone reliable to look at them.
I'd rather not have everyone in the Brigham on this.
It's bad enough we've got this nosy X-ray technician.
Are you all right?
I'm fine. I tried to indicate this was just a transient thing.
A transient ischemic attack, that's all it was.
- He's got his voice back.
- It wasn't an ischemic attack!
It wasn't a seizure.
You saw the X-rays, Mason.
There was something anterior to the larynx that looked like a laryngeal sac.
That's strictly simian.
I obviously regressed...
...to some quasi-simian creature.
I'll show these to someone who can read them right.
You're reading them wrong. That's all...
...because no one is going to tell me...
...you de-differentiated your goddamn genetic structure...
...for four goddamn hours and then reconstituted!
I'm a professor of endocrinology at the Harvard Medical School!
I'm an attending physician at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital!
I'm a contributing editor...
...to the American Journal of Endocrinology!
And I'm a fellow and vice-president of the
Eastern Association of Endocrinologists!
And president of the Journal Club!
And I'm not going to listen to any more of...
...your cabalistic, quantum, friggin', dumb, limbo mumbo jumbo!
I'm going to show these to a radiologist!
Do me a favor.
Conclusion, bilateral aspiration pneumonia.
- Do me a favor and take a look at these.
- What's the story in this case?
A 35-year-old white man, acute onset of aphasia, no history of trauma.
What are you looking for?
It looks to me like the architecture is somewhat abnormal.
Somewhat?
This guy is a fucking gorilla!
Are you okay, Dr. Jessup?
Yes.
Are you all right, Dr. Jessup?
I'm fine.
I just want to make a few notes.
My God, you look so marvelous!
How have you been, Eddie?
Just fine. You?
Fine.
Look, there's Daddy.
Are you going to drive us to our new house?
You bet. Depending how nice you are...
...maybe we'll take you to a Chinese restaurant.
Don't let anybody tell you baboons aren't occasionally carnivorous.
I observed instances of predation...
...which involved the unmistakable behavior of hunters.
A pair of baboons killed the Thomson's gazelle and ate it.
There was even a rudimentary communication...
...between the two baboons...
...so I've become...
...fascinated with the work being done on nonverbal communications with apes.
I've been corresponding with the Gardners at the University of Nevada. i may just go out and spend a couple of weeks there this summer.
I've got nothing else to do except write up my report.
I don't suppose you recorded any of those baboon sounds?
Of course I did. Why?
I'd like very much to hear them.
Of course.
Mrs. Tally said she'll be here tomorrow morning at 10:30...
...to help you put everything away.
She wanted to know if you wanted her to come back to work steady. i got a letter from ason about a week ago...
...just before we left Nairobi.
He says you've been working with a very complex drug...
...which you brought back from Mexico.
It hasn't been thoroughly tested yet and is dangerous as hell.
What else did Mason write you?
That over the past year you've taken about two grams of that drug yourself...
...and you had a very unusual instance of genetic regression about three months ago.
You may have leukemia or lymphoma.
He's been trying to get you to go for a complete workup...
...but you've refused to go.
He's worried stiff that you're cracking up.
He thinks you're behaving very strangely...
...and he begged me to talk to you about this when I got back.
Mason is pathologically incapable of keeping his mouth shut about anything.
- He's a stupid, starched, doctrinaire idiot!
- Mason is a first-rate doctor!
It's not leukemia!
Or any other kind of cancer!
I've let him do a liver-spleen scan on me and a CAT scan.
I have been probed, scoped and palpated!
He's had a mirror down my throat or up my ass for the last three months...
...and there is no evidence, no suggestion whatsoever of cancer!
What else did Mason write you?
Which of these has the baboon vocalizations on them?
- I'd like to hear them.
- Why?
Did he write you that during the regression...
...I had an aphasic experience for about four hours?
The only sounds I could get out were clicks and grunts.
They sound like the baboon vocalizations on your tapes.
Mason said you took blood tests and the lab report showed...
...some characteristics of simian blood group systems.
They also picked up antigens specific to man.
I'd like to see that data.
The thing to do is for me to get back to that isolation tank and try it again!
Let's see if it happens again!
None of us really believes it happened.
After three months, I'm beginning to wonder if it ever happened myself.
They won't go back to the tank.
Mason's taken over the project.
He's got Arthur up in his lab every day fractionating rats' brains!
What the hell am I supposed to do while they're fractionating rats' brains?
Everybody thinks your father's going nuts.
Mommy, when are we going to eat?
Run along now and play with Grace.
I am convinced that the regression was triggered by an act of consciousness.
When I was in the tank,
I entered another consciousness!
I became another self, a more primitive self...
...and the drug, in some way...
...triggered the externalization of that other, more primitive self.
At least look at my data!
Of course. Would tomorrow afternoon be...
Don't patronize me!
It's just possible I'm not mad, you know!
I'm asking you to make a small quantum jump with me...
...to accept one deviant concept...
...that our other states of consciousness are as real as our waking state...
...and that reality can be externalized!
You're screaming.
I get this patronizing shit...
...from Arthur and Mason for three months and I'm sick of it!
We've got millions of years stored away in that computer bank we call our minds!
We have got trillions of dormant genes in us, our whole evolutionary past.
Perhaps I've tapped into that!
I want to get back into that tank and repeat the experiment.
The most elementary laboratory behavior!
Repeat the experiment. Confirm it!
I would like other responsible scientists with me when I do it!
I would like a little consensual validation on this.
We may have demonstrated a whole new force in nature!
For God's sake, don't you agree it merits further investigation?
I have the tapes, notes and everything.
What time would you like to come and look at the stuff tomorrow?
I just want to get the girls.
I'll be right back.
- i'll get it, i'll get it.
- No, no, i will.
It's 8:30, so get washed and changed right now...
...and I want no trouble from either of you tonight.
Hello?
Oh, Mason. Thank you for calling.
I assume you've spoken to Arthur.
No, no, I just got back from dinner with the kids.
Well, I just don't know what to say.
I think you're absolutely right.
He's on the verge of a breakdown.
He was here all afternoon and carried on like a madman and then just disappeared.
Ordinarily I wouldn't be this panicky, but I just am very worried.
- What's the trouble?
- There's an animal loose in the basement!
What kind of animal?
Monkey, I think!
Charlie! Charlie Thomas!
Where are you?
We've got an animal loose in the B-building basement.
I'm heading to the north corridor leading to the boiler room...
...so you guys come down the other way.
Now, watch your step.
He's a pretty good-sized ape.
Call the animal rooms and...
What the hell is he doing down here?
He must be in here somewhere.
I'm gonna take a look up here.
Get out of here!
What were you doing in the tank room?
I remember large fragments of what happened, but not all of it.
You'll have to be patient with me.
I've had Mason looking all over Boston for you all night.
It's okay. I'm all right.
I suppose getting a call at 2:30 in the morning from the police...
...to the effect your husband has been found sleeping naked...
...in the city zoo might have caused you some concern.
I think you could say that.
And Mason writing you this whole time that I'm having a nervous breakdown...
...and you figured
I finally flipped out altogether.
I'm sorry, Emily. Forgive me. I know what a harrowing day I've caused you.
I suppose you've been sitting here all this time...
...trying to figure out how to get me to a psychiatrist.
As a matter of fact, I have.
I don't know how you've put up with me all these years.
I loved you.
Oh, my God, Emily, I don't know how to tell you this. I really don't.
The implications are staggering.
Apparently I entered a very primitive consciousness.
All I can remember is what was comprehensible to that consciousness.
I don't remember, at least not clearly, how I got out of the tank room.
The first thing I remember are the dogs.
I followed a pack of wild dogs to the zoo.
That's how I got there.
In the zoo, I hunted down, killed and ate a small sheep.
I was utterly primal.
I consisted of nothing more...
...than the will to survive, to live through the night...
...to eat...
...to drink...
...to sleep.
It was the most supremely satisfying time of my life.
I may have killed a man tonight.
I remember...
...beating on a...
You don't know the trouble I had getting these clothes.
I had to go down to the security office.
They want you to call the security office right now.
There was some kind of ape loose in your isolation tank room tonight.
Do you know anything about that?
This ape almost killed a security guard.
You didn't bring some ape down to that tank room tonight, did you?
Your watch and stuff are in your jacket pocket. Are you all right?
Is he all right?
Tell Mason what you've been telling me.
I want to hear Mason's views on all this.
I think Mason's views will be predictable. y God! There it is...
...a proto-human. The first and the original truly human form.
Tiny. Perhaps four feet high.
Completely furred.
Chimp-like, but erect.
No knuckle walking. Shorter arms.
He's moving along so gracefully.
There's two, three of them.
Bipedal, tiny... i'm killing... i'm killing something, a goat. i'm killing...
...i'm eating hot flesh. i'm eating the blood of a goat.
Are you okay?
Beautiful.
Beautiful. it sounded like he was having a bad trip to me.
Some of these tank trips can get pretty creepy.
What the hell was that?
Did I wake you? It's Emily.
Eddie, I'm in a kind of wild panic.
I need to talk to you.
I don't know how even to put this into words...
...but I'm beginning to think what happened to you was...
...not just a hallucinatory experience.
I've got this gut feeling that something phenomenological did actually happen...
...that there was some kind of genetic transformation.
I don't know why I think this is in defiance of all rationality, but I do...
...and now that I do, I'm terrified.
I mean really terrified. Petrified.
So am I.
I don't want you doing this experiment again next week.
I have to find out if it actually happened.
I'm asking you to put the experiment off...
...till we understand it more to minimize the risk.
You can't. You have to work back from the event itself.
But you may be causing yourself irreversible genetic damage!
We're not dealing with genetics!
We're beyond mass and matter here, beyond even energy.
What we're back to is the first thought.
I'm trying to tell you I love you.
I know that.
And I'm trying to tell you, this is an all-bets-are-off sort of thing.
We may be opening a black box that may scrap our whole picture of space-time.
We might even have a link to another universe.
For God's sake, you're a scientist.
You must know how I feel.
Yes, I know how you feel.
It's very late.
Would you like to stay here tonight?
I could do with a little love and a little reassurance right now.
You'll stay, won't you?
If I come out of that tank anthropoid,
I'll be in a very primitive state...
...and impossible to relate to, so sedate me while I'm still in the tank...
...otherwise you'll have to chase me around and subdue me.
You come out of that tank looking like an ape...
...I'm going over to Mass. Mental and commit myself.
If it happens, we'll bring him down with a big bolus of Amytal.
What do you mean if it happens?
Everybody keeps saying if it happens!
Do you think something is gonna happen?
Because if you do, I'd like to know.
I'm sorry. I'm just nervous as hell.
Listen, so am I.
Anything happen?
I just checked him 10 minutes ago.
Did you order chicken or turkey?
I hope chicken is all right.
I've got nearly 11:00.
That's more than two hours now.
I think we should stop this.
Frankly, I'm really frightened!
We could be screwing up his whole genetic structure!
Now how do we stop this?
- Can you bring him down?
- He's gonna be sore as hell.
We should never have let him do it!
I don't know how we let him talk us into this.
We were humoring him, but we know he's not crazy...
...and we all know, deep in our hearts...
...he may be onto something beyond our own comprehension!
Now, because I believe him,
I want this thing stopped!
His signs are all good.
He'll sleep a day or two, come out a bit stuporous.
He's got a whopping load of drugs in him.
It's not uncommon for a psychedelic experience like this...
...to whack you out.
You'd hardly call this just a psychedelic experience.
His heart is good. His pressure is good.
I'm more worried about you than I am about him.
I'm all right.
Of all the goddamn men in this whole world, why do I have to love this one?
I can't get him out of me.
Do you know how many men
I tried to fall in love with this past year?
No matter who I'm in bed with, I have to imagine it's him or nothing happens.
No matter who I'm eating with or walking with...
...there's always this pain because it isn't him.
I'm possessed by him.
Oh, it's crazy!
I think that's the way it's supposed to be.
But he doesn't give a damn about me!
You're the only thing he cares about outside of his work.
I was never real to him. Nothing in the human condition was ever real to him.
He's a truth lover.
Reality to Eddie is only that which is changeless, immutably constant.
What happened to Eddie tonight, that was Eddie's idea of love.
That's consummation.
He finally got it off with God.
He finally embraced the Absolute, was finally ravished by Truth...
...and it goddamned near destroyed him!
He never loved me.
You knew him as well as I did.
We were all bits of transitory matter to him.
All right, now, you're going into shock.
I'm going to get you something.
We reached a point tonight where physical science just breaks down.
We're in blue skies!
Tonight was history, and what are we going to do about it?
I'm going to do nothing about it!
Tonight scared the hell out of me!
That tank just blew up!
Whatever happened inside that tank released a hell of a lot of energy.
For God's sake, let's drop this goddamn thing. I don't want to talk about it.
I can't help it!
You may want to go to sleep...
...but the way I feel
I don't expect to go to sleep for a year!
I'm on fucking fire!
I am in there mopping up the goddamned tank room and I would like to know why!
Do you believe in supernatural agencies?
No, sir, I do not!
Then what we saw tonight was a physical phenomenon...
...an inexplicable physical phenomenon!
If it's phenomenological, then it's explicable. I have to know why.
Let me talk!
I've been mopping that tank room...
...for the last three hours and I've had it! Leave me alone!
I would like to tell you what I would like to do!
We have got to repeat this with other human subjects!
We need a selective sample!
We will put up a notice in the Student Union for volunteers!
And get five or six subjects and go back to square one with them...
...and step up the doses of the drug...
...in a graduated fashion and check them against Eddie's values!
We could even get a grant, for Christ's sake!
And here you are, willing to use an untested drug on innocent human beings!
Please stop shouting!
How are you?
Would you like to go back to sleep?
Yes.
Would you mind if Mason had a quick look at you first?
Good idea.
Maybe you ought to have a quick look at him.
Oh, I hope it isn't the kids.
Hello?
Everything's fine, Arthur. He's fine.
It's Arthur. Are you fine?
I'll call you back when I'm more awake.
Everything is fine.
God, I wonder what time it is.
I should call the kids.
I can't tell you how much you mean to me...
...how much I need you and the kids.
I just wanted you to know that.
You saved me. You redeemed me from the pit. I was in it, Emily.
I was in that ultimate moment of terror...
...that is the beginning of life.
It is nothing.
Simple, hideous nothing.
The final truth of all things is that there is no final Truth.
Truth is what's transitory.
It's human life that is real.
I don't want to frighten you...
...but what I'm trying to tell you is that moment of terror...
...is a real and living horror, living and growing within me now...
...and the only thing that keeps it from devouring me is you.
Why don't you just come back to us?
It's too late.
I don't think I can get out of it anymore.
I can't live with it. The pain is too great.
Defy it, Eddie!
You made it real. You can make it unreal!
If you love me, Eddie...
...if you love me!
Eddie! Defy it!
I love you, Emily.
What I'd like to do today is
get your version of what happened.
- You mean the truth?
- Of course.
First, just state your name and your occupation for the record.
Egg Shen, bus driver.
Bus driver.
What kind of bus and where, please?
Tour bus. Bus for tourists.
San Francisco Chinatown.
Thank you.
Now, before we get to the meat of this thing, do you at the present time have any knowledge of the whereabouts of a Mr Jack Burton or his truck?
- Oh, God. Will you leave him alone?
- Mr Shen, please.
You could be in a great deal of trouble. Half a city block explodes in a ball of green flame.
Green flame! All hell is breaking loose here.
And there are people who say you're involved, that you might be responsible, that you're a very dangerous man.
- Now, if you're protecting Jack Burton...
- You leave Jack Burton alone!
We are in his debt. He showed great courage.
OK.
But if I'm gonna be your attorney, there are a few things I have to know that still don't make any sense to me.
Like... do you really believe in magic?
You mean Chinese black magic?
- Yes.
- Absolutely.
Are you still serious about this? And monsters and ghosts as well, I suppose?
Sure. And sorcery.
And I suppose that you expect me to believe in sorcery as well?
- Of course.
- Why?
Because it's real.
How can I know that, Mr Shen?
- How?
- Yes, how? Help me out here.
Please.
See? That was nothing.
But that's how it always begins.
Very small.
This is Jack Burton at the Pork-Chop Express
and I'm talkin' to whoever's listenin'.
It's like I told my last wife.
I says "Honey,
I never drive faster than I can see."
"Besides that, it's all in the reflexes."
You just listen to the Pork-Chop Express and take his advice on a dark and stormy night.
When some wild-eyed maniac grabs your neck, taps the back of your head up against a barroom wall, he looks you crooked in the eye and asks you if you've paid your dues, you just stare that big sucker back in the eye and remember what Jack Burton always says.
"Have you paid your dues, Jack?"
"Yes, sir, the cheque is in the mail."
Well, you see, I'm not sayin' that I've been everywhere and I've done everything.
But I do know it's a pretty amazing planet we live on here, and a man would have to be some kinda fool to think we're all alone in this universe.
I can't believe you're stuck on even.
This is odd!
All right, even! Another even! Come on!
You want one more? All right!
- What do we got? He can't count.
- Even!
Learn how to play some fan-tan here, buddy-boy!
Three!
Heaven and earth, boys. What can I tell ya?
You like that one?
What did he say, Wang? In English?
Something about beginner's luck.
It doesn't translate. But he quits.
He quits? What is this? It's a brand-new day and he's still got 100 bucks in his pocket.
I'm not gonna complain, because I'll bet
I'd have lost my shirt in the next 20 minutes.
Breaks my heart to do this, but the next time I'm down here, you'll gang up on Jack so fast he won't know what the hell happened.
- No.
- Ah, sure. Easy come, easy go, Wang.
No!
Not next time. Now.
Is this gonna get ugly now? I hope not.
I thought what we were here, racial differences aside, was a coupla old friends, both of us Californians.
Shit, Wang. It's only a game.
Nothin' or double.
This knife cuts this bottle in half.
- Nothin' or double.
- Bullshit.
- Nothin' or double.
- Why, man? Don't be stupid.
- I need the money.
- I got near a thousand bucks here, Wang.
1,148, Jack.
OK. But not that bottle.
This bottle.
OK.
You're outta your mind, Wang. God bless ya!
- It's all in the reflexes.
- It always works at home.
Have me over for dinner some year and prove it. In the meantime, pay up: $1,148 times two.
- I don't have that kind of money.
- I didn't hear that.
- I'm just a poor Chinese boy, you know?
- You own a restaurant. That's more than me.
Yeah, right. What I meant was,
I don't got that kind of money on me.
That's what I thought you meant.
Where's your truck?
- I gotta go somewhere.
- No, you don't.
I do. How about we meet in my restaurant in a few hours? I pay then.
- You pay now. Where you gotta go?
- The airport.
- Yeah, right. Over my dead body.
- If need be.
- I'll follow you.
- You don't trust me? That makes me sad.
- It reminds me of an old Chinese joke.
- Save it. I'll give you a lift. Get in.
- You were gonna follow me, Jack.
- I know, then I came to my senses.
- So who are we pickin' up?
- A girl. I don't wanna talk about it.
- A girl? Where from?
- Peking.
This is a big day in my life. I should have gone home and gotten 40 winks.
A girl from China? All right, I never done that.
I picked up girls from everywhere else, but never from China. Is she pretty?
- I'm gonna marry her, Jack.
- Oh, God!
I've known her since we were kids.
I haven't seen her in five years.
I came here alone.
I worked my fingers till they bled.
Before you knew me, I slept on the floor.
I saved every nickel to bring her here because I love her so much.
I can't eat, sleep or think properly without her any more. She'll put my whole life in order.
Boy, listen to me. Real tough guy.
You sound a little nervous, pal.
That's why the bottle didn't slice. My mind and my spirit are goin' north and south.
Flight number 26 has just arrived
at gate number seven.
Whoa. Who is that?
She has green eyes.
You know how rare that is, Jack?
- How can you tell from here?
- Not her. She's trouble. Miao Yin.
Beautiful green eyes, like creamy jade.
Trouble, huh?
- Can I ask you a serious question?
- Absolutely not.
- Would you consider jumping right into...
- Sure, but not with a man in your condition.
- What's wrong with my condition?
- Try standing downwind where I am.
- It's Miller time.
- You know what I say when it's Miller time?
Wait a minute!
- Don't!
- Don't what?
The Lords of Death. Street gang. Punks from Chinatown. What are they doing here?
Tara!
Miao Yin!
Excuse me.
Let's you and me have a little talk, friend.
What?
Where'd you get that?
Wait a minute, pal.
Get that one!
Come on, Jack!
Where?
Call the cops!
Son of a bitch must pay!
What's goin' on, Wang?
Why'd they steal your girl?
You tell me! How come it's not safe to walk in Central Park or to give a stranger a lift?
- Because the world's full of crazy people.
- The American girl knew something was up.
Stay away from her. She's a lawyer.
She's a what? Oh, come on!
- What the hell...?
- They got a clubhouse where they hang out.
- To sharpen their knives?
- I can't ask you to...
- Where is it?
- Thank you, Jack.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
I am Mr Egg Shen, with this wonderful tour.
Sit back and enjoy yourselves, see?
Long time ago, Chinese men with gold-rush fever flooded into California.
We call Gum Shan - Mountain of Gold, see?
Leaving behind their wives and children.
Working for years to complete the transcontinental railroad, saving all their pennies.
And then they sent for their families to help build this beautiful Chinatown you see outside your window this fine warm day.
- Go right, down that alley. Lords of Death!
- What alley?
Go right! Now!
- Where the hell are we?
- Come on, Jack.
Excuse me, ma'am.
I don't suppose you saw a...
No.
Keep moving.
- What is it? A parade?
- A funeral.
- A fighting tong. They're Chang Sings.
- A fighting tong?
Don't panic, Jack.
They're OK. They're good guys.
Maybe we should try a different alley.
What do you say?
Wang, these guys, these Sing Dings.
They got enemies?
- Wing Kong.
- Who wear red turbans?
Holy shit!
These guys are animals, Jack.
- What's happening, Wang?
- Chinese standoff.
A what?
Don't make a sound.
Who's that?
No questions! Just get outta here, Jack!
Jack!
- I think it was Lo Pan.
- Who?
- Don't look, Jack!
- I already did.
- Who? I mean, what?
- Lo Pan. Come on!
- I can't see!
- It's OK. It's only temporary. Over here.
Bend over.
Yeah, yeah.
I ran straight through him, Wang.
How the hell did I do that?
- You didn't. It only appeared that way.
- Right!
- Lords of Death, Jack.
- OK, I'm goin' home. Keep your money.
- Hey, Wang Chi!
- Lookin' for us?
- They know your name.
- That's not good. Let's go!
- My truck!
- Forget it!
Lords of Death controlled by the Wing Kong,
Jack. Just errand boys for the Wing Kong.
Great! Who wiped out all those yellow turbans? Those guys were winning.
He says it was the Storms. The Three Storms.
Three guys did all that? Listen.
What about that... whatever it was I ran straight through?
Fast!
Lucky us. We made it.
- All right, where's my truck? I'm outta here.
- Isn't your truck insured?
- Of course it is.
- Then smart man gets it later.
- Smart man calls the cops.
- Cops got better things to do than get killed.
So do I!
Mutual Fidelity Insurers of Sacramento.
Well, there's gotta be a listing, honey.
I pay 'em six G's a year in premiums.
China is here, Mr Burton.
The Chang Sing, the Wing Kong.
- They've been fighting for centuries.
- What does that mean? "China is here"?
I don't know what that means. All I know is, this Lo Pan character comes out of thin air in the middle of an alley, while his buddies fly around, cuttin' everybody to shreds, and he stands there, waiting for me to drive my truck straight through him,
- with light comin' out of his mouth!
- Jack, please.
- When did this happen?
- It didn't, not like he says.
Yeah, it did. Two hours ago. Tall guy, weird clothes. First you see him, then you don't.
Lo Pan appeared on the street?
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't want to alarm you, Uncle.
I'm gonna tell you about an accident and I don't wanna hear "act of God", OK?
All right, look. What's your name?
Mine's Jack Burton.
- Good afternoon, Mr Wong.
- Eddie Lee, meet my friend, Jack Burton.
- Eddie's the new maître d' here.
- And a whole lot more.
Well, I don't know my policy number.
It's in the glove compartment.
Just look under B-U-R-T-O-N, will ya?
- Jack Burton?
- Yeah.
Boy. The guy you always told me about.
- Then that was your abandoned truck.
- Abandoned, like hell!
Hello. Hello?
Oh, Christ!
Bad news. The Lords of Death stole it after you ran away.
- They stole my truck?
- Take it easy, Jack. You're with friends.
- We'll find it for you.
- Damn right you will.
And my money. And time is money to a guy like me. And your phone is dead, by the way.
- How do you think I feel? I lost a whole girl!
- The Lords of Death were only on ajoyride.
Not acting on orders from the Wing Kong.
They just wanted a girl to sell and Miao Yin got in the way.
Plus, the skirmish you guys stumbled into.
Lo Pan, the word is, ordered the boss of the Chang Sings, Mr Lem Lee, assassinated.
- That was his funeral.
- It was a war, Eddie.
- What are you doing here?
- Don't panic. It's only me, Gracie Law.
Great.
Just passing the neighbourhood on a dark and stormy night?
- This is my neighbourhood.
- Sure it was a war.
And anybody that showed up was gonnajoin
Lem Lee in the hell of being cut to pieces.
- Hell of being what?
- The Chinese have a lotta hells.
- And what the hell is Gracie Law doing here?
- She can't get enough of me.
He wishes. Look, you know me.
I'm always pokin' my nose where it doesn't belong and, I admit it, this mix-up is my fault, sort of.
But I have it on good advice that the punks thatjumped me and took his truck, they took the girl they kidnapped to the
White Tiger's for a quick sale. Who was she?
- My fiancée. The White Tiger's?
- Oh, God. I'm sorry.
If we go tonight, we can buy her back.
A warrant's too complicated,
- violence out of the question...
- Hold it! Slow down.
- I'm feelin' like an outsider here.
- You are!
Jack, listen. I need more of your help.
I can't pay you today, OK?
- Shit.
- How can I? I need the cash for Miao Yin.
- And it's gonna cost. She's got green eyes.
- Seriously? That's an extra.
It's like leather bucket seats: double the price.
- Look, this Lo Pan I ran over... through...
- Has spirit-medium powers.
Like the immortals.
His flesh and his bones are atomised.
He becomes the dream.
- What?
- That's an exaggeration, Jack, I promise.
Please, help me.
I got a great idea.
- Relax.
- I am relaxed.
Look, this is as far as I go, because I'm a dead giveaway, see?
I'd go in there with you, but they know my face and they'd wanna push it in.
- Not while I'm around.
- It's all up to you now, Jack.
My destiny rests in your capable hands.
- I'll do my best.
- Make them drop their guard.
- I'll try.
- Look stupid.
He does.
Boy, it sure is rainin' cats and dogs.
The cab driver said... He told me that I could...
Well, that the White Tiger would...
Just a minute, please.
Excuse me for a second, guys.
I think I know that car.
What's she doing now?
Strange girl.
That building there. The White Tiger.
God, it's creepy. Do we have to go in?
Because I will, if we have to.
I'll go anywhere or do anything to get my story. It's my big break.
Just sit tight. We've got one of our best men inside right now, stirring the pot.
How do you do, ma'am? Henry Swanson's my name and excitement's my game.
- Cash or charge?
- Gosh! Cash, I guess.
I mean, it's not deductible, is it?
Mrs O'Toole will take care of your needs.
Boy, I wish these were in colour.
Because what I really am in the mood for is a girl with green eyes.
And price is no object, Mrs O'Toole.
Fresh off the boat's the way I like 'em.
The more exotic the better.
Chinese girls do not come with green eyes.
- Too long. Let's go in.
- It's only been ten minutes.
Give the guy a chance.
- So how long you been in the US of A?
- Three months.
- Where from?
- Hong Kong.
What happens? You stay here a while?
Old girls leave, new girls come in?
Maybe. Take your tie off, please.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
My wife gave it to me for Christmas.
Holy shit!
Green explosions? People flyin' in and out?
That was not real. I wanna talk to the cops.
I want my truck back.
Now where the hell am I?
- My office. Sit down.
- You sleep in your office?
What I need to get straight is...
These Storms, what are they? Magicians?
- Yeah, sort of. It's hard to explain.
- Try real hard.
If the Storms have Miao Yin, there's one place they'd go.
Lo Pan. The godfather of Little China,
Mr David Lo Pan.
You mean the Lo Pan that's chairman of the National Orient Bank and owns the Wing Kong Trading Company, but who's so reclusive that no one has laid eyes on him in years?
Who the hell are you, anyway?
I'm Margo Litzenberger.
I'm with the Berkeley People's Herald.
I've been trying to get somebody from the press to listen to me about this, Burton.
It's not possible that you saw David Lo Pan.
The bastard's afraid to show his face.
- He's got more enemies...
- He's got Miao Yin. I'm going!
- Are you nuts?
- Who's that?
It's OK, Tara. You can go back to sleep.
- From the airport.
- This morning, sure.
That's why I was there. I was protecting her civil rights, making sure she gets a chance.
This is just so shocking. I mean,
I mustjust be so monumentally naive.
- You are.
- Now we have to grab your fiancée...
Wait a minute! I'm a reasonable guy, but I've experienced some unreasonable things.
- It depends on how you look at it.
- The hell it does! So somebody
- tell me what is goin' on!
- The truth?
- I can take it.
- We don't know.
- I'm going now, alone if I have to!
- Where? It's pouring out.
- Lo Pan's. The Wing Kong Exchange.
- The Wing Kong Exchange?
The most dangerous den of madmen in Chinatown? You can't waltz in like...
Like the wind. Yes, I can, Miss Law.
My mind and my spirits are as one.
- As two. I said I was comin'.
- I'd go with you...
I know. There's a problem with your face.
OK! You people sit tight, hold the fort and keep the home fires burning.
If we're not back by dawn, call the president.
- This is gonna take crackerjack timing.
- Total concentration. You ready, Jack?
I was born ready.
I love working nights.
Don't get up. Phone company.
All right, boys, where's the main panel?
Probably through here.
Wang.
Good work, Jack.
I think they actually fell for it.
Well, last time we had this problem was on account of squirrels chewin' the wires.
- I'd better locate the central junction box.
- I think it's down there.
What does that say?
- Hell of boiling oil.
- You're kidding!
Yeah, I am. It says "Keep out."
We've got to do something!
Goat butts against a hedge and its horns become entangled.
- I don't think I've had the pleasure.
- Miss Gracie Law, Mr Egg Shen.
Egg's kind of our local authority on Lo Pan.
- He's helping us out.
- It has been almost two hours.
- Let's go over there, beat down the door...
- No, Miss Law.
We have to gather our strength, because now there's clouds and thunder.
The image of difficulty at the beginning.
But finally we shall bring order out of chaos.
- Look.
- Yeah.
What you got here is two people dragging a third.
Miao Yin!
- You did that, right?
- I guess so. I hope so.
Jack, check this out.
So what is this? Chinese or somethin'?
- Countin' backwards?
- Not backwards. Downwards.
Of course the Chinese mix everything up.
Look at what they have to work with.
There's Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoist alchemy and sorcery.
We take what we want and leave the rest.
Just like your salad bar.
But there is one thing even David Lo Pan must acknowledge.
All movement in the universe is caused by tension between positive and negative furies.
- So when the furies are out of balance...
- As they are in Lo Pan, who is cursed.
Then the people turn into demons and live for ever.
Repulsive and evil, existing only to plague the living.
Well then, what you're saying is this David Lo Pan... What is he? A ghost?
Plays at being a man.
A creature of vast, dark, destructive power.
All right, out this hatch and up the cable.
Does that sound like a brilliant idea or what?
The cable is three storeys high and covered with grease.
Exactly. It's real and we can touch it, so at least we know where we stand.
Yeah, in deep shit.
- What?
- What the hell...?
- Shit!
- See?
You think they'd let us walk in and out like the wind?
Yes.
I thought that was your whole damn point!
My point was to find Miao Yin at any cost!
- This is salt water, Wang.
- And get your truck back!
- I'll buy another one.
- But there's only one Miao Yin!
Jesus Christ! Where are we?
Hell of the upside-down sinners!
Hey, you! Come on over here and fight like a man!
Shit, Jack. I don't like the looks of this.
- Where are we, Wang?
- You are nowhere!
Oh, boy.
Look, we came here to see David Lo Pan, all right?
David Lo Pan?
- Then you have succeeded, Mr Burton.
- What, you?
- I don't get this at all. I thought...
- Shut up, Mr Burton!
- You are not put upon this world to "get it".
- Come on! Lo Pan is like...
Nothing you can understand.
There are many mysteries and unanswerable questions, even in a life as short as yours.
The way I see it, it doesn't mean we shouldn't ask. Where's my truck?
You are not looking for a truck. You're looking for a girl. A girl with green eyes.
- Yes.
- She must be something extraordinary.
Or I'm not about to waste another 2,000 years.
There can't be many Chinese girls with green eyes these days.
- There are not. Never were.
- So beggars can't be choosers.
But I can!
Tell me about Miao Yin.
What province is she from? Hunan?
Her mother? Her father?
He must be a holy man. I must know.
You got a tongue, Dave. Ask her yourself.
Mr Burton, if you have an influence over your youthful friend, you better exert it now.
Otherwise I will send both of you to the hell where people are skinned alive.
It's that simple. Understand?
- Are you crazy? Is that your problem?
- No, he means it, Jack.
My problem is this place.
This place is my tomb. I'm buried here.
A young man, a king, a warrior, is entombed in this old man's crippled body.
And all I need is a woman, Mr Burton, a special kind of woman with dragon-green eyes, to make me whole and young again, so that I may rule the universe from beyond the grave.
- Ch'ing-ti. The God of the East.
- Who, him? This guy?
No, not me, Mr Burton.
My demon. The god I must appease in order to regain my heart, my blood.
A girl with green eyes to satisfy Ch'ing-ti, a girl brave enough to embrace the naked blade.
- When I find her, I will marry her.
- Never!
Ch'ing-ti will be happy and my curse lifted.
You can rule the universe from beyond the grave.
- Indeed!
- Or check into a psycho ward.
Whichever comes first.
What, I'm supposed to buy this shit? 2,000 years and he can't find a broad to fit the bill?
Come on, Dave, you must be doin' somethin' seriously wrong.
There have been others, to be sure.
There are always others, are there not?
You seem to be one who knows the difficulties between men and women, how seldom it works out.
And yet we all keep trying, like fools.
Who are these people? Friends of yours?
Now this really pisses me off to no end!
- Come on, stick around!
- Where's Miao Yin? In this building?
- Safe.
- Where is she?
Safe.
Safer with me than any creature on earth!
Go ahead. You want bad publicity?
Give us the run-around.
But this woman has a deadline, and her pen is mightier than your sword.
- Yeah.
- No visitors.
- I don't make the policy around here.
- Come on, man! Give 'em a tour.
What's it gonna hurt?
I can help you.
- Are you OK, Jack?
- Yeah.
We're in a room.
No windows, a few skeletons.
- Where's the light coming from?
- The floor.
With the easing of trade restrictions, next year we'll start importing a lot of strange things from Peking.
What sort of strange things?
Are we going up or down?
It feels like down.
Great. Thank you, Jack.
I think we've come up. First we went down.
Now they've brought us up.
Two, three feet thick, I'll bet. Probably welded shut and covered with brick by now.
- Don't give up, Jack.
- OK. Let's just chew our way outta here!
Lo Pan has plans for us, or we'd be dead doornails.
Which Lo Pan? Little old basket case on wheels, or the ten-foot-tall roadblock?
- One and the same person, Jack.
- You know something you're not tellin' me.
Myths and legends.
- I don't wanna insult you.
- No, no. Go ahead.
Insult me.
It's about all sorts of scary things: an ancient army of the dead, the Spirit City and monkey sacrifices.
The First Sovereign Emperor of China, that mad monarch who federated our seven warring states, defeated Lo Pan and imposed upon him that horrible curse of no flesh in 272 BC.
A lot of Chinese hear these things when we're kids, then we grow up, and pretend not to believe them.
- No horseshit, Wang.
- No horseshit, Jack.
I don't blame you. I'm Chinese and I don't even wanna believe it, but it's for real.
Sorcery, the Chinese black magic.
Blindfolds!
You make one move...
Now, let's try that again.
Don't make me kill you, tough guy.
Come on, Jack!
- Come on!
- How?
- Great work, Jack.
- Yeah.
We're all in: me, Gracie and Margo. Uncle Chu and Egg are in Egg's bus, ready to get us out.
- Right.
- Here, Jack.
I'll trade ya.
All right, which way?
Fast, before they wake up.
There, I think. Down there.
No pathetic excuses.
I smell the blood of human beings.
Find them. Boil them until their flesh falls off.
You heard me!
Empty.
I need you, Miao Yin.
You, whose eyes flash like emerald lightning.
Ch'ing-ti, make me flesh again soon.
Please.
Let's go. It's clear.
Safety!
Wang!
First time you ever plugged somebody?
- Course not.
- Come on!
You wanna go up or down?
- Up or down?
- Up.
All has become strange.
A world so unreal and yet, at once, so frightening.
Open up or I'll blow his head off!
Open! Or he dies in the name of Ch'ing-ti and your souls speed with his to the hell of the oily dragon!
- You all right?
- Yeah.
- Margo!
- Jack!
- Where's Gracie?
- On the floor next door. She's a wildcat.
- How are you gonna spring us?
- I have no idea.
That way maybe.
Wang, haul ass!
Come on, keep movin'!
Margo, jump in!
- In there? Are you nuts?
- Go!
- Where's Margo?
- I don't know.
Where are we?
- Where's Eddie?
- Beats me.
Where's Jack?
Jack!
Jack?
Jack!
- Sorry, I'm just thrilled to be alive.
- Yeah, sure. Let's go.
- It's like some giant garbage disposal.
- I think it is, sort of.
Will you just stop rubbing your body up against mine?
I can't concentrate when you do that.
What a pig you are, Burton! I mean, really!
- Where's Jack?
- It's OK. Everybody relax. I'm here.
Jack, I know where we are.
This is a central... what do you call it?
- Sewer?
- Yeah. Water comes in up there.
Seawater from the bay fills this room. They divert it through pipes to different chambers.
I bet up there's where we first got on that elevator.
All right, we're almost outta here.
From here on, it gets normal.
Offices, storerooms: a nice false front.
I count to three, open the door, and we go.
- Everybody got that?
- Ready?
Follow the leader. One, two, three.
We may be trapped.
Hide!
- Hide?
- Hide! They only saw me!
We fight together, Jack. Do or die.
Time to go.
The bus is right outside in the parking lot.
Here's the deal. I run interference and you bring up the rear. Can you handle that?
Can you?
Well, what a night's work!
You got a problem like that again,
- you reach for the sky!
- Let's go!
Come on, come on.
- You're doin' real good, guys.
- Come on, Jack!
Let's go! Open the doors!
- Hurry!
- Move it, Egg!
Duck!
We made it. Holy shit, we made it!
- Where's Miao Yin?
- Inside.
Somewhere inside.
Where's Gracie?
Put me down, you overstuffed monster!
Let me go! Let me go!
What does it mean?
Two girls with green eyes?
After all these years.
You bastards! Unchain me! You're not gonna get away with this. Where's Lo Pan?
This one has fire as well!
Listen,
I've had it up to here with you maniacs.
I wanna see that disgusting flesh-peddler David Lo Pan in person.
Unless the coward's afraid to see an unarmed girl one-on-one!
Where is he?
You know what this is?
This is like some radical Alice In Wonderland.
- That's what this is.
- Then you've got a best seller on your hands.
- Call the police. You're not a one-man army.
- Cops got better things to do than get killed.
Here he is, Jack.
No, these are our friends.
These are the Chang Sings.
- Any of 'em savvy English?
- Hey, man. Who is this guy?
All right. You got any guns?
Not against Lo Pan, but here's one for you to make you feel better, like Dirty Harry.
I'll stick with these. You comin' with us, Egg?
Of course, Jack. It's my destiny. Besides, if I don't you'll never make it out alive.
- I'm on board too then.
- Yeah, sure, kid.
- You can't keep the press out. It's America.
- You're not going back there.
You're stayin' here with Eddie and Uncle Chu.
- Eddie? But he's...
- He's got a crush on you.
- You mean like you've got on Gracie?
- Are you kidding? I just want my truck back.
What do I know?
She's not even your type. All brains.
Come on, let's go!
Play your cards right, you live to talk about it.
Oh, boy.
Are you OK? Are you Miao Yin?
Yes. Miao Yin.
- Who are you?
- Lo Pan.
You have come to seek me out with your green eyes.
Yes.
- No, no.
- Yes.
- What's going on here? Some kind of...?
- Magic. The darkest magic.
My soul swims in it, scattered across time, trapped in the world of formlessness.
Until I find her and marry her.
Marry her?
The girl with green eyes.
The girl who can tame the burning blade.
Miao Yin or Grace Law.
- Great start. It's the other way.
- The front door will get you nowhere.
- Here, let me hold that.
- A brave man likes to feel nature on his face.
And a wise man has enough sense to get in out of the rain.
- He lives here?
- He owns the block. He's a rich guy.
- Rich? This place is a dump, Wang.
- To Western eyes.
The stuff in these bottles is priceless.
Well, all set?
Yeah. Ready when you are, Egg.
- Jack next.
- Where does it go?
- Down. Lo Pan is down there.
- Down where?
- Where is the universe?
- Come on, Jack. Don't be afraid.
Afraid? Are you kidding?
- Where in the hell are we?
- Underneath Chinatown.
That is not water.
Black blood of the earth.
- Do you mean oil?
- I mean black blood of the earth.
A thousand years ago, huge earthquakes turned the world upside down.
Many normal people were killed.
Many unnatural people roam free to commit great offences against the gods.
They have survived the burning blade, tamed the savage heart.
I will marry both women.
Prepare them.
What is that?
- It sounds like...
- Something breathing underwater?
Yeah.
You will come out no more!
What? What'll come out no more?
Come on.
Dammit!
Miao Yin?
Hey, Wang!
- Egg!
- Jack, come on!
It's OK, Jack. Wing Kong storeroom.
Emergency provisions.
We're inside Lo Pan's domain.
Christ!
Later.
We're getting close. Real close.
And now for some more bad news. Ready?
- This gets worse? Come on!
- 2,258 years ago the First Sovereign Emperor...
He subjugated Lo Pan, made him of no flesh.
- Only an evil dream.
- Get to the goddamn point, Egg.
In order to be whole again, he had to find this certain girl of his prophecy, and marry her to appease the God of the East.
But to appease the emperor, he had to kill her.
Kill her? No!
Well, let's go. What are we talkin'
Chinese history for when we gotta get...
We are getting ready to strike the final blow.
- If we reach Lo Pan...
- When we reach Lo Pan.
...then the power in this flask will be our only hope against the Bodhisattva of the underworld, the ultimate evil spirit.
Yes. Only a dream can kill a dream.
I've waited for this for a long time, Jack.
The evil dream will die.
Wing Kong outside.
- Were they real?
- Yeah. Dressed for Lo Pan's wedding.
What's in the flask? Magic potion?
- Yeah.
- Thought so. Good. Do we drink it?
- Yeah.
- Good. Thought so.
I am the past, come back to haunt you, Lo Pan!
My God, no! Please!
What is that? Don't tell me.
A guardian. What it sees, Lo Pan knows.
They have returned.
And this time they are not alone.
Egg Shen is with them.
Little bastard sorcerer has brought them through the Bog of the Dead Trees.
Egg Shen?
Egg Shen! You have come a long ways to find me, but it is too late.
There are two girls with green eyes, and I will marry them both.
And then I will sacrifice Gracie Law to appease my emperor, and live out my earthly pleasures with Miao Yin.
That's right, Egg Shen.
The best of two worlds.
You never know till you try.
Let's get outta here.
You know what I don't like?
Where is everybody?
Preparing for Lo Pan's wedding.
We should not be in here, not this easily.
It's a setup, I'm tellin' ya.
Lo Pan is about to take his queen.
He's too busy to care.
So where is he, Egg? Where?
- Jack, here!
- What?
- Hollow.
- Fuck it.
- I know. It's an elevator. It only goes down.
- Yeah, look.
- Hey, all right!
- Time for the medicine!
- Cheers!
- This does what again, exactly?
Huge buzz.
Good!
You can see things no one else can see, do things no one else can do.
- Real things?
- As real as Lo Pan.
- What more can a guy ask for?
- The six-demon bag!
Terrific. A six-demon bag.
Sensational. What's in it, Egg?
Wind! Fire! All that kind of thing.
Here's to the army and navy and the battles they have won.
Here's to America's colours, the colours that never run.
May the wings of liberty never lose a feather.
I feel pretty good. You know, I'm not...
I'm not scared at all. I just feel kind of...
- I feel kind of invincible.
- Me too.
- I got a very positive attitude about this.
- Good. Me too.
Is it gettin' hot in here, or is itjust me?
Ch'ing-ti! Ch'ing-ti!
Great Ch'ing-ti, equal with heaven, come into our presence and witness this holy matrimony.
- Miao Yin.
- And the ultimate evil spirit.
And now, my beloved disciples, the moment of truth.
The needle of love.
- I'd like to shoot that bastard.
- Not until he's married.
- Then he's flesh.
- Then it's too late.
Ch'ing-ti!
You, who shake the heavens and descend from the east, all I ask in order to conquer this universe is that you grant me flesh and blood.
Yes! Guide my hand as I insert this needle into Miao Yin.
Let him complete the ceremony.
Then he is ours for certain!
Come, my love. Give it to me.
It's working!
I'm mortal!
Look out, guys!
No way!
Come, Miao Yin, it won't hurt.
Shit!
Take her.
Peasant magic!
You never could beat me, Egg Shen.
- It's me.
- Are you all right?
- Never mind me. We gotta get Lo Pan.
- Where is he?
Wang!
Come on.
Pull it apart. Come on!
- Where does this go?
- Up. To Lo Pan's office. It's cooler up there.
- From there we can...
- Do you have a gun, I hope?
- I have a knife.
- A knife? He's 12 feet tall!
Seven. Don't worry.
I can handle him. I took something.
I can see things no one else can see.
- Why are you dressed like that?
- I was getting married.
He was marrying both of us, just because my eyes are green too.
Oh, God. Is this really happening?
- Look into my eyes.
- No! Never!
I have suffered so much pain and agony.
Look at me!
No! I don't understand. I don't belong to you!
No, you don't. You belong to Ch'ing-ti.
I must sacrifice you, but I love you and I need you.
No!
Here, take her! Take the bitch!
- Master, you are flesh!
- I am?
I am! It worked!
Ch'ing-ti is appeased.
Now we must satisfy the First
Sovereign Emperor by destroying this!
Not so fast, gentlemen.
Is it too much to ask, Thunder?
Kill him! For me!
It won't solve anything, Dave. Too many people have been droppin' like flies already and where's that gettin' us? Nowhere, fast.
Nah, you know what Jack Burton always says at a time like this?
- Who?
- Jack Burton. Me!
Old Jack always says
"What the hell?"
It's a good knife.
Goodbye, Mr Burton.
It's all in the reflexes.
Wang!
You all right?
- Hey, thanks.
- Wait a minute.
I don't think he's gonna stop!
Come on!
- We got a problem.
- There!
Come on, Jack!
Jump, Jack!
- This whole place is melting!
- Hello! Hello!
- How'd you get up there?
- It wasn't easy! Stand aside!
Take it away!
Hang onto this.
Watch out, Wang Chi!
Go for it, Wang!
- Go!
- Come on, Jack, hurry!
There's my truck... My truck!
Get in.
- They took the key.
- Do you have a spare?
Course I do, but it's underneath the...
- What was that?
- 6.9 on the Richter scale. Hang on!
- Sorry.
- Don't you know how to drive this thing?
Relax.
Stop! Red light!
Take it easy. OK, we made it.
Yeah.
Look at that.
Doesn't that make you feel good?
Terrific.
The light's green. You can go.
- What are you doin', Jack?
- I'll be right back.
Where are you goin', Egg?
My work's done.
Lo Pan is dead and the evil spell's been lifted.
Years ago I promised myself a long vacation.
It is time to collect.
Well, why don't you go on over to China?
Visit the motherland?
Well, China's in the heart, Jack.
Wherever I go, she's with me.
- So what are you gonna call it?
- I don't know.
Maybe you can come over to my place later and help me find a title?
- Here, Jack. Nothin' or triple.
- Nothin' or double.
Triple. You earned it.
You're right, I did. Thanks, Wang.
Well, last chance. I'm a rich man now.
I can give up the open road, sell my truck, settle down.
Couldn't have that on my conscience.
The only way it might work is if you buy a bigger truck with a cosy little apartment in back, just big enough for two.
That sounds pretty great. But sooner or later
I rub everybody the wrong way.
Well, let me think about it.
God, aren't you even gonna kiss her goodbye?
No.
- See you around, Burton.
- Never can tell.
Bye, Jack.
We really shook the pillars of heaven, didn't we, Wang?
- No horseshit, Jack.
- No horseshit.
You just listen to the Pork-Chop Express and take his advice on a stormy night, when the lightning's crashin', the thunder's roarin', and the rain's comin' down in sheets thick as lead.
Remember what old Jack Burton does when the earth quakes and the poison arrows fall from the sky and the pillars of heaven shake.
Yeah, Jack Burton just looks that big old storm right square in the eye and he says
"Gimme your best shot, pal. I can take it."

Do the BIM
There ain't no good
There ain't no bad
There ain't no happiness
There ain't no tears
There ain't no love
There ain't no hate
There's only power, BIM is the power
Hey, hey, hey
BIM's all the way
B

I said "B"
I-M
Do the BIM
There ain't no pride
There ain't no shame
There ain't no sympathy
There ain't no blame
There ain't no pleasure
There ain't no pain
There's only power
BIM is the power
Hey, hey, hey
BIM's all the way
How are we doing, Shake?
We're doing okay, excitement 90, tension 92... pulse rate 132... and 138 heartbeats.
Yes, my Pandi and Dandi are magnifique.
I'm going to make them the biggest stars of our decade.
There's only power, BIM is the power
Hey, hey, hey
BIM's all the way
Boss, we have just scored...
150 heartbeats.
Gentlemen, I predict our BIM song... is going to take this competition by storm.
Ashley, prepare some BIM merchandise.
- Something like BIM T-shirts.
- T-shirts?
Ashley, use your imagination. This is 1994.
On the 1994
Worldvision Song Competition
Via satellite to over two billion viewers
We are moving on to number six.
And now here they are, singing their song,
Love, the Universal Melody,
Alphie and Bibi.
You're the light within my darkness
You're my shelter from the storm
When my hope grows dim
What the hell is this?
It's a love song.
- Do the BIM!
- Shut up!
Go back to Moose Jaw!
You're the reason that I'm singing
It's you who keeps me strong and free
And deep within my heart
Love, the universal melody
We belong to one another
We share each other's destiny
United by our love
We're all children of the universal family
And we are everybody's brother
We share the birthright to be free
Bob, what's going on?
As you can see, they're starting to climb.
Oh, hell.
The song is love, the universal melody
- What's the matter with you?
- It's so beautiful.
Who the hell are they?
They're nobodies.
I swear, they're just a couple of kids from Moose Jaw.
- Moose where?
- I think it's in Canada.
They're good.
But, boss, for Christ's sake, they're singing a love song.
Love songs are out. It's just nostalgia.
Nostalgia is always dangerous.
Don't worry, boss. They'll never reach a 150.
One hundred and fifty-one.
- Shake.
- Yes, sir?
- Red tape.
- The red tape, sir?
You heard me.
Take this tape and put it on right now.
And don't ask any questions.
But, what if somebody sees?
Then you're dead. Very dead.
Come on, where's this coming from?
What's this?
We are parts of one another
And we could live in harmony
If we would make the choice
To tune our hearts, raise our voices
And sing the universal melody
Mr. Boogalow.
Oh, monsieur Boogalow,
Je suis Jean-Louis de la Radio Monte Carlo.
Avez-vous quelque chose a dire aux ecouteurs de la Radio Monte Carlo?
Oui, a Ce moment, mesdames et messieurs, je vous passe
le plus grand imprésario Du monde, monsieur Boogalow.
Mesdames et messieurs, la meilleure chanson a gagné,
alors Le BIM sera toujours avec nous.
- Merci et bonne nuit.
- Bitte sagensie auf Deutsch.
Naturlich, meine Damen und Herren, das beste Lied hat gewonnen.
Der BIM wird immer mit uns sein.
Danke vielmals und gute Nacht.
Bon, monsieur Boogalow, italiano per favore.
Signore e signori, la migliore canzone ha vinto.
Allora il BIM Sara sempre con noi, grazie tante e buona notte.
What about something for the billions of Americans who were watching?
The best song won.
The BIM is with us to stay.
The government has adopted your BIM song as part of the national fitness program, is that true?
- You'll know tomorrow.
Rumor has it that there was another song which came very close to being the winner...
Just a moment, who do you write for?
I'm Joe Pittman from The Daily Post.
Very well, Joe Pittman, will you repeat your question?
Yeah, people say that this whole competition was rigged.
You may print what you just said,
Joe Pittman... and you will find yourself in the unemployment line tomorrow morning.
- How about that?
- Well, sir...
Thank you very much.
- What is it, boss?
- Nothing.
Joe Pittman. Just remember that name.
We won the first prize. We won it.
Congratulations!
I did it with this.
Daisy.
Thank you.
Let's drink to this.
How about a drink with our BIM glasses?
Lovely, Ashley.
Ladies and gentlemen... a toast to BIM.
BIM!
Bibi, I don't want to go there,
I don't even like the guy.
It's just a party. I promised we would go.
Come on, let's just go home.
But he liked us, maybe he'll sign us.
We need an agent.
- I don't trust him.
- He's the biggest agent in the world.
He made Pandi and Dandi.
He made the BIM. Please, Alphie.
Ashley, your BIM-ball machine appears to be very successful.
- What else have you got to astound me?
- This, sir.
A BIM earring. Nice.
But it's not only an earring.
It's a BIM mark...
- and you can stick it anywhere.
- Well done, Ashley.
Clever boy, now get everybody to wear one. Immediatement.
Ladies and gentlemen, attention please.
Our marketing genius, Ashley... has invented a beautiful BIM mark.
We're all going to wear it from now on.
And I shall be the first one. Voila!
Mr. Boogalow.
Anybody for a BIM mark?
Take a BIM mark.
- Pandi, may I Bimunize you?
- Yes, you may, my darling.
Boss, they're here!
Here they are.
Ladies and gentlemen, my guests of honor from...
- Moose Jaw.
- ...Moose Jaw.
Come, my friends, let me introduce you to my stars.
This is my star, Dandi.
Hi, nice to meet you.
And this is my beautiful Pandi.
Now, let's all have a drink.
We have something to celebrate.
Bravo!
- How about BIM and tonic.
- BIM your way out, please.
I want to tell you, you did a great job with that song. Just great.
But the crowd booed us in the end.
Forget the crowd, they're just not into that kind of crap anymore.
Crap? Well, Alphie wrote it.
Well, there you go.
Champagne, young man?
Sorry, I don't drink alcohol.
Did you hear that? But this is remarkable.
- Our young star from...
- Moose Jaw.
...Moose Jaw does not drink alcohol.
And how about you?
Yes, please, I'll have a glass of champagne.
Wow, that's my baby.
Dandi, why don't you show this beautiful young lady my penthouse.
With pleasure.
Would you like a grand tour, too,
Mr. Shake?
Well, why not?
Come, young man, we have a lot to talk about.
- We do? What for instance?
- Your future, for instance.
- This is the roof garden.
- It's so beautiful out here.
Oh, my God, look at the people.
They look like little bugs running around.
- I've never been so high in my life.
- You're joking.
Here, try one of these.
- What are they?
- Just little pills, they won't harm you.
Come on. Take it.
- You're really from the sticks, aren't you?
- From where?
From the sticks, like out in the boondocks.
Are you speaking English?
Look, the boondocks means you're from the middle of nowhere.
You know what I'm saying?
You're from the middle of nowhere.
Forget it.
Get out.
You're made for me
Created for me
And I am your man
You're made for me
It's fated to be
And you'll be my woman
Why do you do this to me?
Tell me why?
The touch of your hand
Has me trembling inside
I don't understand
This magic I feel
Are you a fantasy
Or are you real?
You're made for me
Created for me
And I am your king
You're made for me
It's fated to be
And you'll be my queen
How do you do this to me?
Tell me how?
One look in your eyes
And just look at me now
Your arms are so strong
You hold me so tight
Can it really be wrong
When it's feeling so right
I'm under your spell
It's too late to run
I just can't help myself
Are you the one?
Are you really the one?
You're made for me
C'est la vie, my friend.
- Quit frowning.
- We need a lawyer.
I thought this was supposed to be the happiest day of our lives.
- We've got to get a lawyer.
- We can't afford one.
The guy's a shark. He'll eat us alive.
He's just an agent, he doesn't own us.
He's only taking 50%.
Have you ever seen an American contract?
It's hundreds of pages of double talk.
He'll destroy us.
Or make us.
Good morning. We're...
I know, I saw you last night on the Worldvision.
- We have an appointment with...
- Mr. Boogalow.
Would you please take a seat over there.
How long we gotta wait?
Mr. Boogalow's a very busy man.
- What are you, a clown?
- Diyaklof.
Dick Diyaklof from Kansas City, manager of Ballet 2000.
Who?
Like a puppet on a string
Like a monkey on a swing
Man is clinging to the ropes
Of the fantasies and hopes
We are dangling
Mr. Boogalow.
He's so eager to believe
And so easily deceived
Like a baby watching magic
He's so gullible, it's tragic
In a word, naive
Life is nothing but show business in 1994
- We fight
- For the spotlight
We kill for encore
Life is nothing but show business
The world's a cabaret
We live for the fortune
We die for the fame
See the incredible shrinking man
Watch him before your eyes
As he grows smaller
And smaller
And smaller!
Like the bleary-eyed baboon
To an organ grinder's tune
Mankind screamies
For whatever bits of dreamies
You might treat them to
A computer for a heart
Make him stop or make him start
Feeding him emotion
While we feed on his devotion
And he calls it art
Life is nothing but show business in 1994
We fight for the spotlight
We kill for encore
Life is nothing but show business
The world's a cabaret
We live for the fortune
We die for the fame
Life is nothing but show business in 1994
We fight for the spotlight
We kill for encore
Life is nothing but show business
The world they have arranged
We live for the fortune
We die for the fame
Mr. Diyaklof. Mr. Dick Diyaklof and the Ballet 2000.
Mr. Boogalow will see you now.
Good afternoon.
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.
May I introduce my lawyers,
Sir James Clark and Mr. Clark James... from the firm James, Clark and Weinstein.
Boogalow always keeps his word.
The contracts are ready. Initial each page and sign at the end, please.
Thank you.
Contracts?
- Why two?
- Separate entities.
Why can't we sign as a duo?
- Ruling 247 E.
- Paragraph 17.
It's in your own interest.
Mr. Boogalow always protects his clients.
Just trust him. He's here to represent you.
He's on your side.
Mr. Boogalow, do you mind if we read them first?
Fine, fine with me. Take your time.
Just keep in mind... that you have an appointment with Ingrid Stockinger at 5:00.
Who's she?
What do you mean, who's she?
Ingrid Stockinger is the in fashion designer.
Yes. Our wonderful boss is kind enough... to buy you some new clothes to fit your new image.
Mr. Boogalow, did you say 5:00?
That's in 20 minutes.
Yes, and the press is waiting, too.
So let's not waste time.
Ashley, we are ready for the press.
Voila!
Where do I have to sign?
- Right here, young lady.
- And here.
- Bibi, wait a minute.
- What now?
What now?
Look, I want to read the contract, and I want to get a lawyer.
Mr. Boogalow, we can sign tomorrow. Okay?
Impossible. Mr. Boogalow has to go to Paris for a marketing conference.
I'm sorry.
Boog is already selling your first album.
But we haven't even made one yet.
First you sell it. Then you make it.
That's marketing.
Mr. Boogalow, surely we can sign next week?
Next week you won't be available.
- What do you mean?
- You're going to the West Coast.
Mr. Boogalow has already arranged your first concert tour.
America, coast to coast.
Sign there.
Initial there, and after that.
- That's beautiful.
- Down there.
And here.
And there.
And this one here.
On the bottom.
And those two.
What's going on?
Oh, my God, what's happening?
What's going on?
Are you all right?
What's the matter with you?
- There was an earthquake.
- A what?
An earthquake.
It was an earthquake. I didn't dream it.
Of course you didn't.
When I signed my first contract,
I also felt the world was going to pieces.
Come on, Alphie, sign, and let's go to the West Coast.
Come on, Alphie, just sign it.
Sign.
Don't you see what's going on?
What are you talking about?
Pull yourself together, Alphie.
It's getting dark.
It's the middle of the day.
It's getting dark.
Look!
Just look at this joint.
- Do you like it?
- I love it.
- I hate it.
- You can go back to Paradise.
Come on, Bibi, let's get out of here before it's too late.
Let me have a look at you.
Sorry, no flowers here.
Beautiful. Come in.
I'd like you to meet someone.
Meet my son, Dandi.
Bibi.
- Hi, Dandi.
- I've been waiting for you.
What about her?
Don't worry about her, she's my sister.
- Shake.
- Yes, master?
- Bring the hors d'oeuvre.
- Our special hors d'oeuvre.
My special hors d'oeuvre, the apple.
Bring the master's special hors d'oeuvre, the apple!
Don't be afraid.
Taste it.
- Don't!
- Alphie.
Come here.
Taste it.
Magic apple, mystery apple
Take a little ride, let me be your guide
Through the apple paradise
Juju apple, voodoo apple
Take a little bite, spend a splendid night
In our garden of delight
It's a natural, natural, natural desire
Meet an actual, actual, actual vampire
Let the apple set your soul on fire
You'll be hypnotized
And you'll be demonized
But you'll be paralyzed
So you'll be victimized
You're fascinated, captivated
Losing your mind
When we cast the apple eye on you
Holy apple, sacred apple
Take a little chance, get into a trance
And join me in the apple dance
Go! Go!
Do it
Oh, yeah
It's a natural, natural, natural desire
Gets you higher, higher, higher
Let the apple set your soul on fire
You'll be hypnotized
And you'll be demonized
And you'll be paralyzed
So you'll be victimized
You're fascinated, captivated,
Losing your mind
When we cast the apple eye on you
Holy apple, mystery apple
Juju apple, voodoo apple
Sacred apple, holy apple
Trust the apple
Yeah, bite the apple
Bite the apple, take the apple
Crazy apple
Yeah!
Take a bite
You'll never get me! Never!
Alphie, wait a minute.
Don't worry about him.
- Where are you going?
- I have to go with him.
- You don't have to go anywhere.
- He's my boyfriend.
Bibi, he doesn't own you, he can't tell you what to do.
He's not your master.
My dear girl, from now on... whether you like it or not... you're a member of the BIM family.
Why am I the darling of the BIM elite?
Why does everyone fall at my feet?
Could it be because I'm so sincerely sweet?
Yes! I know how to be a master
Cultivate their need
Grab them by their greed
Slaves are guaranteed
When you know how to be a master
He knows how to be a master
Reaching the top is such a long, hard climb
Millions of people stand and wait in line
Do you think I got there being patient and kind?
Yes! I know how to be a master
Push and shove and claw
Step on those who fall
It takes no time at all
When you know how to be a master
He knows how to be a master
It's boring being cruel continuously
Sometimes I tire, so I show sympathy
But now we had this tête-à-tête, you see
Yes! I know how to be a master
Lure them into chains
Whip them till they're tame
They'll learn to love their pain
When you know how to be a master
He knows how to be a master
The world is nothing but a big Casino Royale
With bodies to buy, souls to sell
Do I win by playing just the card I've been dealt?
Yes! I know how to be a master
Lie, cheat, steal
- Betray
- And double deal
It's you who spins the wheel
When you know how to be a master
Cultivate their need
Grab them by their greed
Slaves are guaranteed
When you know how to be a master
Ladies and gentlemen, please, one at a time.
- She'll answer all your questions.
- Now, Mr. Warrick.
Miss Phillips, how does it feel... a girl from nowhere about to become
America's number one BIM star?
It's frightening, but I put all my faith in Mr. Boogalow.
Can you tell us your immediate plans?
Mr. Boogalow arranges everything for me.
Miss Phillips, what about your private life, any plans for marriage?
Miss Phillips will be too dedicated to art and too busy for such infidelity.
- Anyway, she's already married.
- Married?
To the BIM.
As for her immediate plans... she is on her way to the West Coast to begin her first American concert tour.
America, the land of the free
Is shooting up with coke energy
And everyday she has to take more
Speed
America, the home of the brave
Is popping pills to keep up the pace
And everyday she cries out for more
Speed
From New York out to L.A.
Everybody does it her way
Pumping power by the hour
Speed
I can feel the earth start quaking
When America starts shaking
Pumping power by the hour
Speed
America, of thee I sing
To get your fix, you'll do anything
There's just one thing that's worth fighting for
It's speed
America, your reds, whites and blues
Are in our blood, we're strung out on you
There's just one thing we're all dying for
Speed
Everybody needs speed
From New York out to L.A.
Everybody does it her way
Pumping power by the hour
Speed
I can feel the earth start quaking
When America starts shaking
Pumping power by the hour
Speed
I need speed
Gotta have speed
Speed
- Just a minute, lady.
- Yeah? What do you want?
- I'm gonna have to take a look at you.
- So look.
Sorry, I'm going to have to give you a ticket.
- Why?
- 'Cause you're not wearing the BIM mark.
You know it's obligatory now.
- It is?
- Yes, ma'am.
Just go along to your local post office... you buy some, and you wear one from now on.
- Where do I wear it?
- You wear it anywhere you want.
It's 12:00. How can a man sleep so long?
- Alphie, good morning.
- Good morning.
- What time is it?
- It's late.
Oh, shit! I'm late.
Your damned alarm clock didn't go off again.
It did, too. It woke me up.
Oh, my God, what happened in here last night? A pogrom?
No, I've just written a new song.
Yeah, I heard it.
You kept me awake all night with that racket.
Gee, I'm sorry. How did you like it?
I'll like it when you sell it, and pay me the rent.
I'll sell it. I know I'm going to sell it.
I need the money. This government's crazy.
Now they came out already with a new tax.
What new tax?
Some shit. You go to the post office and you wear it on your face.
Oh, the BIM mark.
I'm not going to wear one.
- They'll arrest you.
- Let them.
Why don't you write the kind of shit they like... so you can sell it and pay me what you owe me?
I want the money by the end of the week.
Listen, I've written a new song.
They'll buy this one.
I hope they do. Yeah, right.
You know, that song, I kind of liked it.
Yeah, it put me in mind of the old days.
It made me cry.
When love has gone
I knew there had to be a heart in that big bosom of yours.
Would you stop that? Go away.
Come here.
- Alphie, I gotta make...
- Now, listen. Sit down.
Now, just wait a minute.
Listen to this.
I walk through a world of deceit and decay
Full of faces with sad frightened eyes
The same look she gave me when she walked away
And was trapped in the web of their lies
Oh, where has it gone?
Where has it gone?
Oh, where has it gone?
Where has love gone?
And if it takes all of my life
Then I shall wait all of my life
Just in case
She should decide she needs me
I've searched every street of this cold, wicked city
I don't know where else she could go
I've heard that he's treating her well
And she's happy
I'll believe it when she tells me so
Oh, where has it gone?
Where has it gone?
Oh, where has it gone?
Where has love gone?
Oh, where has it gone?
Where has it gone?
Oh, where has it gone?
Where has love gone?
Thank you very much.
Sorry, I couldn't hear you.
That's all for now. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much what?
Yes? No? Good? Bad? Shit? What?
Well, it's not exactly what we're looking for at the moment.
What exactly are you looking for?
You're a talented young man.
Look around, see what's on the market.
I'm sure you'll come back with the right stuff. Good luck.
Your ID card.
Why, what's the matter?
Your BIM Mark, you're not wearing one.
I have to give you a ticket.
Attention. Attention please, good citizens.
It is now one minute to 4:00.
Time to stop ordinary activities and prepare for the national BIM hour.
All traffic must pull over and stop immediately.
BIM exercises commence in 40 seconds.
Join in the national fitness program.
Citizens, attention.
Counting down to BIM hour.
Exercises designed for your health and peace of mind.
All citizens must participate.
Attention, citizens, shut down the machines
Put away your work, get up and get ready for BIM hour.
Ten seconds to BIM hour.
The national fitness program is watching you.
- Five.
- Four.
- Three.

BIM!
Hey, hey, hey
BIM's all the way
Bibi!
The king is dead. God save the queen.
Get in the car, will you?
Alphie!
Bibi, I must see you.
I've got to talk to you.
Get in the car.
There's no way she's coming back to you.
Look at her. She's a star now... and you're just not good enough for her, so go away. Now get out of here!
Get in the car, Dandi.
And you can get out of here, will you?
You stupid shit.
You never learn, do you?
Alphie, where are you now?
Will I ever see your face again?
You tried to set me free
Knowing all along your love was no match for their evil
You came after me
Oh, Alphie
I wish that I were dead
I'd rather die than know that I hurt you
How can I go on?
You were the only hope left in this hopeless world
And now you're gone
You're gone
Cry for me
If there really are angels to hear
Cry for me
Let the heavens rain down with your tears
Where has all the pity gone?
I sing my song to deafened ears
Bibi can you hear me now?
They've got me with my back against the wall
There's no place left to turn
Should I go on living for the memory of your love
Or should I end it all?
Cry for me
If there really are angels to hear
Cry for me
Let the heavens rain down with your tears
Where has all the pity gone?
I sing my song to deafened ears
Cry for me
If there really are angels to hear
Cry for me
Let the heavens rain down with your tears
Where has all the pity gone?
I stand alone
I stand alone
Cry for me
Thank God. I thought you were dead.
Look what you made me do.
Now you owe me for the door.
Next time you lock yourself in,
I'm going to call the police.
You want to kill yourself?
Do me a favor, jump off a bridge.
Don't do it in my house.
I don't want to spend my life explaining to the police... that I didn't murder you for the rent.
Come on, sit up. That's it.
- Now open your mouth.
- What is it?
Chicken soup. Now shut up and eat it.
You kids today, you're so meshuga.
I guess you know I didn't sell the song.
Sure, I figured out you tried to kill yourself because you were so happy you sold it.
Did anybody call for me when I was out?
No, she didn't call.
Did it ever cross your feeble brain... that maybe she's waiting for you to call her?
- Like the guys used to in the old days.
- I can't.
They won't let me talk to her.
So get your ass out of bed and go find her.
Hey, girl.
Darling, how nice of you to come.
Maybe I'll leave it. Some other time.
See you're busy.
No.
My friends would just love to meet you.
You come right on in.
Girls, meet Alphie.
Hi. I'm Betty. I've heard so much about you.
I'm Collin. I saw you on the TV in the World-a-Vision.
- You were terrific.
- Thanks.
I'm Robin. May I get you a drink?
No. I'll get him a drink, if you don't mind.
Hi there, Alphie.
Excuse me, fellows.
So, how have you been?
- Fine.
- You don't look so fine.
Scotch on the rocks.
Oui, tout suite, one scotch on the rocks coming up.
- Jean-Louis.
- Oui?
Give him my special drink.
Oh, ma preference, Pandi.
Don't I know you from somewhere?
Jean-Louis, Radio Monte Carlo.
Here come two Passionate Pandi specials.
- I know you, too.
- Yeah. Joe Pittman.
Joe Pittman from The Daily Post.
What's he doing here?
He works for Mr. Boogalow now.
So, Mr. Boogalow bought him, too.
Correction. Mr. Boogalow bought
The Daily Post.
So, we finally have the pleasure of your company.
- You know why I'm here, Mr. Boogalow.
- No, I don't.
- Why are you here?
- I want you to release Bibi from her contract.
Cheers.
Mr. Boogalow!
Yes, you were saying?
Is something the matter, boy?
I want you to release Bibi from her contract.
I heard you the first time.
Well, what do you say?
Why don't you ask her if she wants to be released?
- Pandi, where is she?
- She's here somewhere.
Pandi, where is she?
Where is she?
Come. We'll go and look for her.
I'm coming
Coming for you
Now I'm coming
Coming for you
Let me tempt you and tease you
And hold you and squeeze you
And feel every inch of your love
Let me show you things
You never dreamed of
Coming
Coming for you
Now I'm coming
Coming for you
Come and take me and shape me
And mold me and make me
And fill me up with your fire
Come do anything to me
Your little heart desires
Come to me
Come do me
I'll come for you
Make it harder and harder
And faster and faster
And when you think you can't keep it up
I'll take you deeper and deeper
And tighter and tighter
And drain every drop of your love
Coming
Coming for you
Feel me coming
Coming for you
Coming
Coming for you
Now I'm coming
Coming just for you
Bibi!
I'm coming
Coming for you
Feel me coming
Coming for you
Coming
Who are you?
Bibi.
What do you want?
Go away.
Good morning.
You were shouting in your dream.
Was it a dream?
Couldn't have been a dream. I was there.
Come.
Come have some breakfast.
Come on, children.
Peace.
Who are you people?
These are refugees from the '60s, commonly known as hippies.
Priscilla, Lotus Blossom, we have a guest.
Get him some coffee and some breakfast.
Friends, we have a newcomer amongst us.
Peace. I haven't heard that word in a long time.
Thank you.
Good morning. Coffee?
- Where is everybody?
- They all went down to the sauna.
Clean themselves up after last night.
- You want to go sauna with me?
- No, thank you.
Did you have fun last night?
I had the strangest dream.
You dreamt that Alphie was here, didn't you?
- Yes. How did you know?
- He was here.
Oh, my God.
- Go to him.
- What did you say?
He loves you. He will take you back.
Go find Alphie.
Pandi, what was that you were just saying to her?
What I should have said to her a long time ago.
- Go back to your room.
- Don't listen to him.
I'm getting you out of here.
- You're going nowhere.
- It's a trap, don't you see? He's a louse!
There is a cave under the bridge.
You can find us there.
Hey, you!
The park's closed to the public before 7:00 in the morning. Now beat it!
I said, beat it!
- Where do you think you're going?
- Get out of my way.
- Bulldog, let her go.
- I take orders only from him.
- You want to go?
- Yes.
You'll be real sorry. Bulldog, let her go.
- Shake!
- Bulldog, let her go.
Thank you, Pandi.
Go to him. He loves you, only you.
- Come with me.
- No, it's too late for me.
Go, Bibi, and never come back.
My serf!
Something's happened to me
Suddenly I'm not the same
I was caught in a maze
So blinded and dazed
I couldn't remember my name
Now I've opened up my eyes
And I can see how lost I've been
I was so empty and numb inside
Now I'm full of feeling again
I'm laughing
I'm crying
I'm finally alive
I see the light
I feel it all around me
Healing me
Revealing me
I thought that I had died
Then I looked into the light
And I found me
It's you. Where have you been?
- Is Alphie here?
- No, he don't live here no more.
He came, took his things and left my house this morning.
Hey, kid, I hear he's hanging out under the bridge.
You know, with all those old bums.
Go find him, he needs you.
Thanks!
I'm laughing
I'm crying
I'm finally alive
I see the light
I feel it all around me
Healing me
Revealing me
I thought that I had died
Then I looked into the light
And now everything's all right
I found me
Hello, there.
Over here.
Are you looking for someone?
Yes, I was told people hang out around here and my friend is with them.
I think I know your friend.
Come with me.
Don't be afraid.
Come on.
- Your name is Bibi?
- Yes.
If you know my name, you must know Alphie.
Yes, he joined us this morning.
Here, take my hand. Come on.
- What's wrong?
- These people live in this cave?
- Yes, and they're very happy here.
- But it's impossible.
It's like the Stone Age.
These people don't like television.
And Alphie lives here, too?
- Down there in the bachelor quarters.
- Oh, my God.
Come, my dear.
I'll take you to him.
Light my way, child of love
Shine on me, child of love
Be my eyes, child of love
Help me see, child of love
Child of love
Wait, my friends, don't panic.
They're all yours, Mr. Boogalow.
- What do you want with us?
- Is Miss Bibi Phillips among you people?
Will Miss Bibi Phillips please step forward?
Otherwise we will be forced to arrest you all for harboring a criminal.
Why? What's she done?
- We will ask the questions here.
- And nobody else.
Bibi Phillips is my wife.
I have a right to know.
I'm Bibi Phillips.
Miss Bibi Phillips, we have a warrant for your arrest.
Will you please come with us?
She's not going anywhere.
Forgive me, my dear sirs, she's been with us every day.
She's been living here for over a year now.
Are you her lawyer?
She has done no harm.
She owes BIM Incorporated $10 million.
$10 million.
Is that all?
All right, everybody. That's enough.
You're all under arrest. Let's go.
What's gonna happen to us, Alphie?
It's gonna be all right.
I know he's going to come.
- Who's coming?
- Mr. Topps.
- Who's Mr. Topps?
- Don't worry, just trust me.
I know he's coming.
Who the hell are you?
- They call me Mr. Topps.
- Sergeant, arrest that man.
- I can't.
- What do you mean, you can't?
I can't move my legs, I'm paralyzed.
Alphie, bring your wife and child, and come with me.
Hey, Topps.
What do you think you're doing?
- I've had enough of you.
- But we have a warrant.
Come on. Don't worry.
And you, my good friends, come and join us.
All of you!
We belong to one another
We share each other's destiny
United by our love
We're all children of the universal family
And we are everybody's brother
- Where are you going?
- Goodbye, Dandi.
Pandi, come back.
And we could live in harmony
If we could make the choice
To tune our hearts and raise our voices
And sing the universal melody
Wait a minute, where do you think you're taking them?
I don't know yet.
- I'm looking for a new place.
- A new planet?
If I can find one free from your pollution.
Don't tell me you're going to start all over again.
Yes.
- But this time without you.
- Without me?
But, my dear Topps, you know that is not possible.
The world simply cannot exist without me.
Let's give it a try.
Gorbash! Gorbash! Come!
There was time between the waning age of enchantment
and the dawning age of logic
when dragons flew the skies.
Free and unencumbered.
Look down there Gorbash, my friend!
On that troubled earth below us, confusion and chaos reign.
All mankind is facing an epic choice.
A world of magic or a world of science.

This cannot be.
The worlds of magic and logic must exist side by side.
Not destroy each other.
Take care!
Be careful with your machines I say.
Who is making all that rumpus?
It's that balmy old gent what lives upstream.
Your motors must not crowd out all magic.
For the world is lost.
How sort of magician I hear?
I am Carolinus!
The Green Wizard.
Your loony you are. Get back to where you belong.
I belong everywhere, for my domain is the green world.
Nature itself and all its inhabitants!
Envatos... Umabella... Flamenca...
Away with your mill wheel.
A ball of blue magic to make it disappear.
Disappear say I!
Kala!
Magic he calls it.
My little boy could do better.
- Father you need rest.
- No time.
Just was not there.
I called upon magic and there was none.
Oh…
- The pain again?
- I can't let it bother me.
Have you written the messages as I asked?
Yes father, but...
Then summoned The Silver
Owls Of The Full Moon.
- But...
- Summoned them I say!
Is it true?
Did they stone you?
Well, me and young Gorbash will fix um'...
We'll burn down that mill and devour every living one of them.
That would do no good.
Just a little scared then... uh?
A short fiery blast to turn their hair white… uh?
Smrgol, please!
Father, the owls.
Smrgol, I'm summoning my brothers to a meeting.
Our first in four centuries.
Away.
Ommadon too?
The ancient laws command he be included.
Make Gorbash ready for the journey to the Temple Of All Antiquity.
I wish I could carry you, old friend.
No, you serve me well as the past.
Let young Gorbash bear your burdens now.
Father, who are these brothers?
You never spoken to me of them.
I know you are Green
Wizard Of Nature Realm.
But the others?
My brother Solarius, is the Blue Wizard.
Lord of the depths and the heights.
He's realm is outer space,
deepest ocean, highest mountain.
My brother calls council, but why?
Lunarian! Lunarian!
And my brother Lo Tae Zhao.
The Golden Wizard.
His realm is light and air.
He is lord of transcendence, healing, contemplation.
I was expecting this, it was inevitable.
Shen Zu, Shen Zu!
And finally, high in Loathly Tower.
My last brother,
Ommadon.
The Red Wizard.
Lord of the devils domain, seducer of darkness,
master of that heartless magic the world calls black.
Bryagh, Bryagh!
My fool brother has just realized the inevitable.
Well, I'll go.
It should prove amusing.
Bryagh I say!
Astride the terrible Bryagh, he is absolute ruler
of that infernal like mass of primordial filth which is his domain.
But why does Antiquity force you to include something so abominable?
As evil is a part of all things,
evil is a part of our world of magic.
For the irony of all existence is that good would be totally impotent without the contrast of evil.
Oh father, take care.
- Gorbash stands ready.
- Then I am on my way.
Ah? Whether does thou command me, Oh Master?
Gorbash, for pity's sake, no formality please.
Heh,... Well I ah,... Like to do things by the book.
To the Temple Of All Antiquity.
- Right. Where?
- I'll guide to as we go.
Away.
Dear brothers, we meet today in the Temple Of All Antiquity.
Come, come get on with it.
Why did you summon us?
As you must have noticed, our magic powers have been growing dim.
I have so noticed.
It is because man is choosing logic over magic.
- But why?
- Because logic is so,... Logical.
So what are you going to do?
Sit around like a bunch of old nanny's and let it happen?
Please, hear me out.
I propose we create the last realm of magic.
- Magnificent!
- Incredible!
The Magic Realm, where all enchanted things might retreat before their age ends.
If we consolidate our powers there will be enough magic left to create such a place.
Sealed off from the rest of the world by the Midst Of Invisibility.
You would defeat science and logic with,... a foolish retirement village?
Not defeat my brother, enhance.
The world though it does not realize it cannot do without magic.
For example, man hears of the dragons invulnerable skin
and lo, he makes armor, battleships, tanks.
A fairy flies and furiously jealous man
himself defies gravity with machines he will call airplanes.
A magician looks into this crystal
and sees and hears halfway across the world.
"Aha", says man, "if only it could be so."
And centuries from now
he conjures up miracles but calls them radio and television.
If man is to surmount the insurmountable there must always be magic to inspire him.
The world needs magic.
Magic cannot die.
It shall be.
I will bring you distant stars, wonders from the sea.
And I will bring you peace and harmony so that every magic thing might live together and share what enchantment remains.
No! Never!
I will not concede defeat by this modern world!
I will not retire to this "Fool's Paradise."
But we have no choice! The inevitability is the strongest magic of all.
I have weapons you would not dare use.
Fear rules men.
By summoning all the dark powers
I will infest the spirit of man so that he uses his science and logic to destroy himself.
What havoc and raze. Turn brother against brother.
Greed and averous shall prevail.
And those who not hear my words shall pay the price.
I'll teach man to use his machines.
I'll show him what distorted science can give birth to.
I'll teach him to fly like a fairy.
And I'll give the ultimate answer to all his science can ask.
And the world will be free for my magic again.
Stop! This must not be!
We want none of your dark magic.
While your powers die, mine will flourish.
Man will never inherent my domain.
For I am making man mine.
He will understand and come to desire my magic.
It is inevitable.
You shall see.
This dark determination
I swear.
By this red crown.
The source of all my dark power.
So be it!
Now and forever!
Farewell.
Can you not feel the world turning in my direction already?
Can his dark magic be stopped?
Only by invading his realm and capturing that cursed red crown from his head.
You may include me.
I will bring the fire of the meteors, the rage of the seven seas.
What was that all about?
Antiquity will not allow us to become involved.
The eternal laws of enchantment expressly forbid the four magic brothers from waring on one another.
Oh, quite right.
Terribly sorry.
- But what can we do?
- We must inspire a quest.
With its sacred mission, to steal the Red Crown Of Ommadon.
We will enlist the aid of allies who share our beliefs.
Mortals, enchanted folk, beast, dragons.
All such creatures in my dominion are peaceful.
Hardly suitable.
I can inspire Neptune himself to join and great whales and serpent of the sea.
Unfortunately, the quest will be waged on land.
No good brothers, it seems I and I alone can inspire such a mission.
Whom will you send?
Well first, my old friend
Sir Orin Neville-Smythe,
The Gallant Knight And True.
- And?
- My dragon, Gorbash.
He's young and impetuous but incredibly strong and brave.
And...? There must be three to begin a magic quest.
The laws so command.
There will be another.
A leader.
Who?
- I haven't the slightest idea.
- How Then?
Tonight, after you both have returned to your realms
I will turn to antiquity for the choice.
Its wisdom shall prevail.
Well, whoever Antiquity choose, Your leader will have his job cut out for him.
I leave him this,
The Shield of Saturn.
Forged from the mystic dust of her rings, it will deflect any dark magic spell.
I have only implements of peace, but perhaps he will find the
Flute of Healing Sleep useful.
It is from the
Temple Of The Muses.
When played, it will lull the most fearsome dragon to sleep.
Thank you, good brothers.
Ommadon will not prevail, and his crown shall be captured.
- So be it!
- May victory be ours.
Hay, a war at last.
Finally I'll will see battle.
Not a war.
A quest.
Well what ever you call it.
I'm ready for it.
Unfortunately so is Ommadon.
Hear me now Antiquity.
Hear me, oh great conglomeration of spirits gone before.
Make you will known.
Who shall lead the quest to capture The Crown Of Ommadon?
Search the future.
He will be the distant descended of Great Peter
The Dragon Master.
Ah, I have heard legends of Great Peter.
Centuries ago he tamed the dragons and taught them to speak.
Seven hundred and seventy seven generations
separate Great Peter from he whom you seek.
But why so many generations away from the original.
He is the first of the descendants who is a man of science.
Why should that be important?
TRUST THE JUDGMENT OF ANTIQUITY!
I do, I do. Implicitly.
Tell me in which century will I find this champion.
Ten hence from this. Our nine thousandths.
That would make it the 20th century by man's calendar.
The closing decades.
A silver acorn?
Drop it into the Limpid Pool of Time
and you will find him.
And now, farewell.
Are you certain this is
The Limpid Pool of Time?
My dear young fellow, I am one of the four magic brothers.
I should know a limpid pool of time when I see one.
Dragons and wizards and dungeons and princesses.
Dragons and wizards and princesses and dungeons and castles.
Mr. Dickenson, is this all you think about?
Never mind what I think, what do you think of this new
Flight Of Dragons game I invented?
It's fun.
What can I say.
Just a couple of thousand dollars we can manufacture this and we'll all be living like kings.
"Just a couple of thousand." he says.
Like it was peanuts.
This is an heirloom. It must be worth something?
Your heirs didn't loom so big.
If I give you fifty I'd be fired.
Flight Of Dragons, aren't you writing a book by the same name?
Was,
I don't have time to work on it now.
Not with holding down two jobs but, if this game sells...
You know something, Mr. Dickenson?
Nothing personal, but you're a real dragons nut.
They fascinate me.
Always have.
I'm sure they really existed at one time.
See, I'm trying to dope out how they breathed fire, how they flew, how they...
I take back the nut part.
Your a dragon fanatic.
Right, I eat, breathe, and sleep em'.
I hope to become a member of England's Dragon Society and I live here in Boston!
You turn, evil wizard.
Why am I always the bad guy?!?
Nine!
Aha! I got you blocked in
The Enchanted Ice Passage, frozen stiff.
Yeah, but an 11 we'll give me dragon fire to melt it...
That's going to be our leader?
That's the seven hundred and seventy seventh son of...
Antiquity must know.
Trust Antiquity.
How's he going to stand up to Ommadon?
Playing with toy dragons.
Look! Look closely at those small chessman he's playing with.
The piece the pawn broker is playing with is Ommadon.
And there's me,... and my brothers.
Dickenson piece is you!
And in the background, Princess Melisande!
Extraordinary!
Somehow, Dickenson knows what we look like.
Somehow...
Good old Antiquity.
I knew I could trust it.
Gorbash, fly to Silvenair and wait for me.
Tell Melisande to summon
Sir Orin Neville-Smythe.
But where are you going?
Intombley... Varioso...
Custon... Wizar... Kala!
Bring me to him. I insist!
Marvanzio... Kala!
What the heck happened? Hey, are you deaf or something?
A splendid game.
Come down and joint it.
What?
Untronto... Kala!
Twelve.
There's no beating that.
Come down I say.
Kala.
- What happened?
- I'll explain during the journey.
- Journey?
- Sit down.
Vidzumad... Kala.!
Keep your wits we're almost there.
That's what you said before!
Since those diced burned out it seems like we've been falling for hours.
Actually it's been more like ten centuries.
- Welcome home, Carolinus!
- Good old Smrgol!
A dragon!
I'm actually seeing a dragon!
A real dragon?
Call me Smrgol!
Son of a gun, a dragon!
I'm talking to a dragon!
I'll get you down.
A dragon, I'm riding a blooming dragon!
What you call me?
Ow!
- Turn your head!
- Pardon me, I'm sorry.
I've just been singed by dragging fire.
What a great way to travel.
Well, if you don't need me any longer,
I hear the call of my comrades.
A mating dance perhaps… Um?
Really, Smrgol. At your age.
You wanted dragons my son, dragons you shall have.
I'll never understand.
All those toy chessman I carved.
Those dragons and wizards.
How did I know what you look like?
Why question? Just trust Antiquity.
Am I dreaming all this?
Am I on that game board or in reality?
Perhaps somewhere in between.
Imagination is the most potent of all magic.
Look! Another of your creations come to life.
- Father! Father!
- The Princess Melisande.
My fairy princess.
Oh, I made her everything I ever desired in a woman.
Well, what I mean to say.
What you mean to say, is just what you said.
- Will I meet her?
- Yes.
Oh, but not dressed like that.
Department store Seersucker all charred by dragon exhaust.
Convento... Circulum… Kala.
I hope the fit is correct.
As I explained during the drop, my magic is quite limited these days.
Your Highness, may I present, ahh...
Sir Peter.
- Sir Peter, this is the Princess Melisande.
- Your highness.
Oh, you must be he whom my guardian has sought to save our world.
Ahh, I… suppose I am.
- Am I?
- Trust in Antiquity.
Did you summon
Sir Orin Neville-Smythe as I requested?
He'll be here by dawn tomorrow.
Carolinus!, Hello!
Wow! Another one.
Hey, look at what I've been saving.
Its gold, Gold, GOLD!
Oh! That pain again. I've asked him not to bellow so.
Simply magnificent sight.
But Sir Peter, it is only
Gorbash our house dragon.
House dragon?
Now you've met the entire family.
Gorbash, this is Sir Peter.
Oh yes, how-d'ye-do.
See a soup tureen.
A-A bowl to you, of solid gold.
Really Gorbash.
If you're hoard grows much larger, there will be no room for furniture in the house.
Blast, that's what I keep telling you.
I need a cave of my own.
Soon enough, when our quest is victorious.
Well ah... Sir Peter old buddy, your army's better be worth their salt.
We need power.
- My army's?
- Sir Peter has brought no army's.
What? No armies!
Aah,... Will you please.
What good is he? What good is he!
What good is he!
Calm down. Now just look at yourself.
Release some gas young fellow, at once.
Huh? Oh...
And turn your head.
Extraordinary!
The fiery breath has something to do with the dragons ability to fly.
- But what?
- I'm certain you’ll figure it out.
Help!
Help me!
- Uncle Smrgol!
- He's lost his fire! Help him Gorbash!
- What happened, old friend?
- My... My comrades...
My Cronies...
The entire... flight they all...
All turned against me.
The other dragons?
Why?
Because I-I wouldn't denounced you and... and join Ommadon.
The other dragons have gone over to Ommadon?
Aye. Aye he's cast a spell on them all.
A flight of dragons to protect his crown.
What a strange use for gold.
Because dragons tend to ignite ordinary bedding, they must find a soft metal to sleep on, and gold proves most comfortable for them.
Ah,... hence the dragons need for a hoard.
Ahem. Perhaps we'd better continue this conversation in my study, less chance of interruption there.
The Last Realm Of Magic,
My own personal dream.
Wow, what a movie show!
Sit down my son, I've got lots to explain.
So that is Peter Dickenson!
That is the pathetic fool Carolinus has enlisted to steal my crown.
Still, Antiquity must have had a reason.
Bryagh, fetch me the fool.
And so you were the one person from all the centuries whom Antiquity has chosen.
They say it is because
I am a man of science?
Well aren't you?
I was at first, honor student, scholarships, awards, grants, research,
but, how it all bored me.
Who could ponder equations when he had the chance to imagine dragons?
So I turned my back on it all
and started on my book
"The Flight of Dragons".
"The Flight of Dragons".
Yes, yes here it is.
"The Flight of Dragons" by Peter Dickenson.
Th...?!?
It's impossible. That's not even half finished.
Of course not. This is my library of unwritten books.
See? Beowulf, The Idols Of The King,
Gulliver's Travels, The Tempest,
Alice in Wonderland, The Wizard of Oz...
Incredible.
Nice to know you finish it some day. Aye.
Oop, no fare peaking at the end.
You are unique.
A man with one foot in the realm of magic and the other in the realm of science.
Sir Peter, I present you with
The Shield Of Saturn and The Flute Of Olympus.
Sir, I'm no warrior.
I'm awkward, clumsy.
Not anymore my son, for I believe you have found your time and place.
You are too modest, Sir Peter.
Let us toast the quest.
No, no, my dear. Cider makes evil magic in the stomach.
Oh, poor father...
You know, I had a professor with your condition but it had nothing to do with magic.
It was plain stomach ulcers.
Milk was the only thing that helped.
Milk? Really?
Alas, Gorbash has devoured every cow with in 20 miles.
Oh father, waist a little magic and change the cider.
- This toast is important.
- Ah, I suppose you're right.
Kala... Bovinamo!
To the quest!
Amazing!
Aww.
I tried all kinds of spells and incantations, but...
You see, Sir Peter?
Your science has helped already.
Do you find this enchanting, Sir Peter?
Beyond my wildest dreams.
If all this is just a game,
I wish to play it forever.
I beg you to take this.
A talisman.
Take it and may it protect you.
You are my champion, Sir Peter.
Bring me back The Red Crown.
Ohhh!
- I'll tell you I smell strange dragon.
- Look, terrible!
Bryagh's capturing your scientist for Ommadon.
And our quest is over before it starts!
- Father, Gorbash, do something!
- Wait here! Come on!
I'll overtake the swine!
The devil dragon is to swift.
A removal spell is called for to bring Peter back.
That takes too long.
Let me do it.
I call on all Antiquity to give me magic enough.
How does it begin?
Carvic crom zoominiy lava.
Yes,
Carvictom... zoomili... lavathol...
Ahh! Father he's dropping Sir Peter!
May our rocks crush your skull.
Untumble... varistone... misaclonis... madleumrot... Oh the biases! Kala!
What happened?
Where's Peter?
He's Gone!
He's Gone!
Gorbash, your releasing to much fire!
Breathe in! Breathe in!
Come nephew, you can pull through, keep breathing.
Yeah. Open your eyes.
Ah, h-he'll be coming around soon.
I didn’t have time.
The spell was incomplete.
- I'm certain we'll find Sir Peter.
- Where?
He could be at Loathly Tower, Boston, or on the moon for all I know.
Uhh.
He's awakening.
Right as reign.
By all that's magic, is the dragon not a wonderful creature?
Open your eyes boy. Come on.
Come all the way about.
It's me lad, your uncle.
Don’t you recognize me?
Uncle? What?
- Melisande!
- I am here, brother.
Brother?...
W-We kissed...
Kissed?
Oh!
What is it child?
Does he knows where Peter?...
He... He...
He is Sir Peter!
Well of course I'm Peter.
By The Beards Of Antiquity!
- I went and merged them!
- Merged?
Peter and Gorbash are one.
Peter is in Gorbash!
Well blast it man, undo it.
I can't undo till I find what
I did in the first place.
But... but where is Gorbash?
He's still inside here with me.
I feel him in the back of my mind, sleeping soundly right now.
Well, may he rest well till I figure how to separate you.
This can't be a game.
I-I-I never invented a rule to cover a situation like this.
Sir Orin Neville-Smythe, at your service!
I ridden all night.
Before the quest begins,
I hope theirs time for a good hot cup of tea.
Tea?
Milk.
My Dearest Brothers
Lo Tae Zhao and Solarius;
Today, at noon, began the quest to capture the Red Crown of Ommadon.
If the urgency of our mission is never questioned, yestereve's tragic comedy is proof enough of our waning magic powers.
For a spell went wrong, and Sir Peter of Beacon Street, was merged with my dragon, Gorbash.
Our quest now contains one knight, Sir Orin Neville-Smythe and one dragon with the mind and heart of twentieth century man.
The laws command that three begin.
Melisande being out of the question,
I enlisted the temporary aid of old Smrgol.
Aw, I know Smrgol is aging and none too strong, but I hope Carolinus will gather other allies.
He'll need them.
Meanwhile, the old dragon will be able to teach Peter the way of his species.
A dragon,... that doesn’t know how to be,... a dragon!
Come on out you mealy-mouthed little runts.
Is this necessary?
You want to fly don't ya?
To fly you need gems stones.
To get gem stones, you rob dwarf mines.
Come on out I say!
And bring gems!
- Hurry now, before we devour you!
- You wouldn't really?
Ah, dwarfs no.
They all sinewy and hairy.
Well the meat you get is not worth pickin' out of the teeth.
Now swallow them down.
Not all the way, let them find your craw.
Odd sensation.
Never had diamonds in your craw?
I never had a craw.
They help grind up the white fire rock when you eat it.
That’s limestone.
A puny man word if I ever heard it.
Eat!
You'd wear down your teeth grinding this stuff so you swallow it in chunks.
Wiggle them around with the gemstones till their pulverized.
It's like birds use grit to grind seeds.
Yeah, but don't talk with your mouth full.
What's all this to do with flying?
It makes the fire in your belly that gives you lift.
Hmm? Limestone is high in calcium.
Calcium when mixed with stomach acids would form hydrogen.
Hydrogen is lighter than air, thus giving the lift you talk about.
Something like a blimp.
What?
You got fire inside you when you go up.
That's all you need to know.
No, that's not logical. How could my ribs contain fire?
If I could only visualize.
Aw, for crying out loud.
Visualize.
I know.
Man this is great.
Now, as you explain,
I'll make a diagram.
Of all the.
Aw, well I'm doing it for Carolinus.
You see we got this great like, um, like a honeycomb of bone and muscle inside us.
- Something like this?
- Hey, hey that's it.
Compartments we can expand and contract.
And when we expand the hydrogen a-a, "Dragon Fire" as it were.
Expands and makes us lighter than air, and up we go.
Hey, how do I get down?
Blow it out.
Belch.
Yes, close the valves and expelled gas to come down.
Well, go ahead.
Turn your head ya' dummy!
Wo-wo-wo-whoa!
But I wonder why it comes out as fire?
Because we're dragons and dragons breathed fire.
Yes, but what makes the ignition?
The "Thor Thimble" fool.
Lluk' n' th' ruff' oof' yor' moufe'
Feel it, feel it with your tongue.
Yes, it feels like a thimble.
Ow! Ow!
Electricity!
The electricity ignites the hydrogen hence the fiery breath.
Dragon fire, dragon flight.
It all makes perfect sense.
Oh, what I wouldn't give for my typewriter.
Ah shut up and eat your limestone.
I must say Lancer, this is the lowest quest I've ever undertaken.
Still, I suppose it necessary that
Sir Peter to learn how to fly.
Nice chap what?
Soon it will be nightfall.
Ommadon hours.
Mmm?
I'd best summon them.
Og, hear that? Aww, he's calling us.
Shall we go back on foot or... do you think you can manage a short flight.
I can try.
Expand... feel the lift...
Now propel yourself this way.
Use your wings to steer to navigate, and to keep your balance.
Woo!
Look, I know you don't like comparisons, but this is exactly how a 747 does it.
I love it!
I say old chap, bad show.
- I'm ok, I'm ok,
- Argh, you blew all your fire.
You won't have any lift again until dawn.
Well you certainly don't want chance night flight.
We best make camp.
Right, I'm going to miss my bed of gold.
Care to join me, Sir Peter?
No, I suppose not.
All big dragoned as you are, must be most annoying.
Aww.
I have a longing to eat a cow.
I can't believe it, an entire cow.
Hoofs, tail, bones, ears... the whole thing.
Yes well, to each his own.
You know, I shouldn't really like you so much, with all that business with Melisande and all.
If it weren't for this, this dragon business, the laws of chivalry would force me to challenge you to a joust.
I hope we never come to that, Sir Orin.
I do love her with all my heart.
Her purity, grace, innocents, and title are an inspiration.
- Have you known her long?
- Since she was five.
Oddly enough, you brought us together.
- Me?
- Well, Gorbash did.
You see about a dozen years ago,
I was mucking about
in Ommadon's Red Devil Realm or whatever it's called.
Some... sort of quest, returning from a crusade, perhaps.
I suddenly spied a rather smashing sight.
A nest of dragons eggs.
Well, I was about to do a charcoal sketch,
when who showed up, but Bryagh.
He began to sup of the next generation, as it were.
Hold and get ye hither, or prepare to die!
Aah!
Rather,... rather good blow, if I do say so.
Must have been half an hour before I opened my eyes.
And when I did,...
I'd found he had decimated the entire litter, save one.
Well it seems a shame to die for an egg.
But I'd made the challenge.
Laws of chivalry and all that, you know.
Bit of this. Bit of that.
He had me. I had him.
Couldn't open his mouth you see, the gases built up inside.
And I, took a bit of a chance
And let him devour my metal gauntlet.
In less than a moment it touched "Thor's Thimble."
Bit of a internal explosion I fear.
Almost killed him. Wished it had.
He didn't like it at all.
Took him seven years to recuperate.
Quite a bit for dragon.
Hates me, needless to say.
Anyway, I'd saved the egg.
Cute little fellow, awkward and helpless.
Named him Gorbash in honor of the contest.
For it was rather gory and
I did get a bit bashed about.
Get it? Gory, bashed. Hence Gorbash.
Popped in on my old friend Carolinus.
Found he'd adopted an enchanting daughter.
Gave her the little dragon.
Old Smrgol said he'd be like an uncle, teach him the way of dragons.
I made a vow to fall in love with Melisande,
when she was old enough, of course.
Kept the vow, huh, dash it lot of good it did me.
And now she likes me.
I did write rules to this game you know.
No, I mean, I'm really quite sorry.
Not at all old chap. Feel lucky she's attracted to you.
Blast! It's fading.
- Is all my magic spent?
- Father, rest.
- But I thought I heard just as it faded.
- Heard want?
A chattering sound which could indicate something so terrible.
No, impossible.
Not in the forest. And yet,
I wouldn't put it past Ommadon to...
See! See! Blast you.
Gentle sweet brother...
My magic's not spent just confused.
I want the forest, not...
I am speaking to you through my magic,
which is none too strong.
Let me be quick. Melisande has powers to see over distance.
- True, but...
- Father, let me try.
Very well my dear.
Close your eyes.
Easy now.
You will see Gormli Forest.
Our friends, defenders of the Magic Realm...
Yes, yes. Smrgol is asleep.
Peter and Sir Orin are speaking.
Oh father, I do hear that sound, it's terrifying!
We best follow the old fellows example.
We'll be nearing the devils realm by the morrow.
And will need all the rest we can get.
Do you Hear? Strange. Like some insects.
Not?... Crickets no doubt.
- Seems to make my hold head tingle.
- Yes it… It is rather annoying.
It couldn't be! They only appear at the seashore.
What?
Impossible I tell you!
Why you yelling at me like that!
You stupid slobbering beast!
Don't you know Sand Murks?
Why you idiotic, tin coated, little goody two shoes.
Peter, it's the Brain Fryer!
Blot out the cursed sound!
Sand Murks, try to understand!
Hold Sir Peter, I beg you.
It's the Sand Murks.
Horrid little creatures who attacked by the millions.
Their chirping drives all living things insane.
Your brain will burn till you die!
Ow!
I did it to bring you to your senses.
Now listen, fly, fly away before it's too late!
Can't,... I can't, used up all my left in the crash before.
Look, I see them.
Clear your mind! Think, think anything a poem, a song, don't let them burn your mind!
Aah!

It rained all night…

Melisande, come to your senses!
You! You killed my mother and father, you blamed the night demons!
But you!

Aroo.
- What?
- They've, they've retreated.
Thank heaven. Thank heaven.
Oh my child, what have I allowed to happen.
Have they robbed you of all your senses?
With you sleep like this forever?
Oh, my darling, darling child.
Aroo.
Hold cur. Not one step further.
And this is the thanks I get?
Gorbash old friend.
You look like you've seen a ghost.
Matter of fact, maybe you have.
Who's laughing? Huh?… Making such a confounding racquet.
I haven't slept a wink all night.
Missed my gold and…
Aragh, good old boy,
I -I thought you were dead.
- You know him?
- Know him? Of course I know…
It's Aragh, friend of the family.
Like a, a big brother to you.
What's the matter, Gorbash?
Did the Sand Murks steal your memory?
Sand Murks? Were there
Sand Murks? Here?
Nonsense.
They live by the sea.
Eh Smrgol, you could always sleep through anything.
The whole trick with Sand Murks is to get the big one, the queen.
The others are brainless without her.
Aragh, you're supposed to be dead.
Killed, dragged out to sea by a giant squid.
Quite right.
I woke up underwater.
Awaken, brave Aragh.
I am Solarius, lord of this realm,
and I can restore you.
Do I, do I live once more?
No, you are drowned, but
I have a task for you.
Accomplish it, and you will live again.
Yes.
Ommadon has enlisted the Sand
Murks to defeat Carolinus.
You must destroy them.
Give me life and I will.
After the task. For nothing living can withstand their terrible cries.
Destroy them and you will start to breathe once more.
Seemed like a fair bargain.
I did my part, and as soon as Queen Sand Murk was gone
I started to breathe.
So Solarius obviously did his.
Good old Gorbash.
What times we used to have.
Aragh, I've-I've got to explain.
Explain later, we have the
Sun and must press on.
Forward, to the realm of the red death, and the Red Crown of Ommadon!
Aroo.
- You have friends about?
- A female… Trouble.
She's protecting her cubs.
Wait!
If he's not careful, he'll have the whole family on his hands.
I can't say I mind the chance to rest though.
What the blazes?
Blazes? We've got to get loose.
It's Dragon Ruins.
Hold your breath, don't breathe.
Ugly, foul, smell.
Those golden (crimson) flowers.
Can't stay awake.
Not a wolf for miles.
Well, whoever is doing the shooting god bless him.
He certainly can handle a longbow.
I trust he's on our side.
There he is.
Good show old man. I bow to such expertise.
And doff his helmet to a better man that I.
And I doff my cap to you Sir Orin.
By all that’s holy!
I am Danielle of the woodlands, Sir Orin.
You know me?
My father sang of your exploits.
You have always been a hero of mine.
- Too good to be true.
- Hush!
You must forgive the wood elves.
They are petty outlaws, but good at their jobs.
And this is their leader,
Giles Of The Treetops.
For shame!
We saw the dragons.
We thought they were Ommadon raiders.
A thousands pardons Sir Orin.
Had we but known.
Ahh, think nothing of it little fellow.
The way things are nowadays, we all get a bit mucked up.
Get your men down from the trees and awaken the dragons.
Hurry now.
Whatever your quest is,
I should be honored to join.
Well, it's a bit unusual, but, speaking for myself,
I should be honored.
Nay, delighted to have you.
I assure you, my skills will prove most useful.
Daniel has joined them father, and Giles, The Elvin Outlaw.
Night is falling and they are but a day away,
from the Realm of Ommadon.
Looks like an inn.
Hellsway, last outpost of civilization before the realm of red death.
And beyond that wall, all is Ommadon's.
Seems to be a castle guarding the gate.
Ay, Gormli Keep.
The tollhouse on the way to Hades, with a giant ogre as tollkeeper.
The Ogre of Gormli keep,
I've heard tell of him.
A lumbering three-eyed giant as big as a house.
Press on, to Hellsway Inn.
Good bed and some hospitality will be welcome tonight.
Innkeeper.
Innkeeper I say.
At your service Sir Orin.
How are my friends doing, below?
I will look to them.
I do not usually allow dragons in my cellars.
But for you...
Who are those four somber spoilsports?
Merchants from Ommadon's realm.
You allow Ommadon swine!
Shh!
My inn is between two worlds.
I cannot take sides.
Well I don't like um!
I'll see to the dragons downstairs.
On to Ommadon.
- More wine?
- Wine not.
This isn't wine. It's mead.
But not bad.
Peter, how that a' Beacon
Street song go again?
♪ I came from Louisiana with a banjo on my knee. ♪
♪ Oh ho, Susanna, oh don't you cry for me, I've gone to Alabama with a banjo on my knee. ♪
Pluck-a, pluck-a, pluck-a, pluck-a, pluck-a,...
I am ruined!
Those dragons, they've devoured over 100 ham,
60 cheeses, and at least 30 barrels of my finest mead.
Tut Tut, you will be well paid.
Dragons have gold you know.
- They have it with them?
- You will be paid eventually.
My father told me,
"Never extended credit to a dragon."
Shh.
Too late for such caterwauling's.
Too late.
For the morrow brings…
Your rooms are ready.
Will you finally to bed?
- Ay, good innkeeper.
- For we may not see another night.
I'll, show you the way.
And lo, they sleep. An all to brief surcease, well earned.
And but for the watchful moon keeping her vigil o'er the slumbering countryside
all is still.
Aah!
- What is it child?
- Something looms.
Huge, terrifying. With two mad eyes, where three once were.
The ogre.
Ommadon has sent the Ogre Of Gormli Keep.
- Smrgol, look!
- Um? Ach'. What a terrible mess.
- Did we…?
- Don't-don't admit to anything.
Look! The Innkeeper.
Murdered. It's horrible.
I smell ogre.
Help! Over here!
Giles, are you all alright?
I'm near parboiled to a fare-thee-well.
But I sooner be cooked than crushed by that thing.
- Tell me what happened man?
- I hid in the soup when I first heard him.
He reached in the window and took Danielle and Sir Orin from where they lay.
- Then off he goes.
- Where to?
The dungeon at
Gormli Keep no doubt.
They're to hold them till Ommadon decides what foul deed to perform on um.
Oh no.
A fat lot of good I am at this quest.
Overcome by the Sand Murks and trapped by the elves net.
And then a stupor when the ogre attacks.
Now, now Peter, you've got a job to do.
And you'll do it.
What's that?
You must take the Ogre Of Gormli Keep.
Let me tell you something about how to fight ogres.
- You listening?
- Yes.
Good.
First thing to know this about the bones in an ogre.
They're thick, you see an ogres arms and legs are, are mainly bone. That's why biting is no use.
And their flesh don't burn.
So save your fire.
Aww, If this were my game and I face these odds,
I'd just fold up the board and put it on a shelf.
Ahh, Please continue.
Let's see, hopefully, throw him over a cliff,
If no cliff, go for the throat or stomach.
Never let him get a grip.
I-I'd take him myself but, age has gotten to me.
I know, sir.
- Huh? You mean I should?
- No sir!
Well, don't tell anybody what I just confess.
Ah, there it is.
Gormli keep.
Now you hold back and hide in the brush, we'll need the horse when we free um.
Ay, now, call him out.
Give him the challenge.
- Ahh, what's his name?
- Huh? It don't matter with an ogre.
Hey, you will suffice.
Hey you, come on out and fight!
Go to it lad. Go do it! Now!
Charge him, hit his chest, knock him over the wall.
Strength, give me strength!
No lad! Nooo.
What are you doing?
Aw, bad no.
You let it get a grip on ya!
Aw, blazes!
Hey, Hey You.
Let that schoolboy go.
Ahh, Ommadon coming.
You think he can help you?
- S-S-Smrgol?
- Yes.
Aw, that a,... a back side maneuver, I a...
Will that was, one I'd... uhh, failed to mention.
Easy, easy old friend.
I think...
I think something's,... burst inside me.
I think my heart's gone laddy.
But, but I-I did do him in… huh?
Yes! Yes you certainly did.
What I dreamt, … to have a way, to finish it glorious...
And so they move through Gormli Gate.
Old Smrgol. Oh, I shall miss you friend.
And lo, they enter...
The Realm Of The Red Death.
Easy Lancer, easy boy.
Just a stagnant stream.
We can ford it.
Wait, I know that smell.
Don't go near it!
Daniel, take one of your arrows and shoot it into the stream.
Waste an arrow?
Will need all we have.
I'd do as he says.
By my father. What is that slime?
Dark magic, that's what! Dark magic!
Maybe, but is also highly corrosive acid.
Much stronger than anything
I ever ran into at the lab.
It's got a sulfur base though that's what I smelled.
You do speak in riddles old man.
What's causing the horrible muck?
What is it?
A Worm Of Sligoth.
Never saw one that big.
If Lancer can get me in and out quickly enough,
I believe I can behead the scummy thing.
Wouldn't do any good,
Chop it up into 100 parts and each one would live to spread the slime.
- Do we make a run for it?
- Too chancy.
- Oh, of all the filthy.
- Steady lass.
Peter, fly the others away.
I'll remain and do what I can.
I'll not take flight.
Either I'll have worm for supper tonight or worm sups on wolf.
No, there's a better way.
Peter, are you intact?
Yeah, used up all my fire though.
No lift left.
Don’t know if anyone's though of this but, after that display,
Ommadon sure to know we're here.
These replicas of our visitors are exact, to the smallest detail.
Perhaps they can handle ogres and worms.
But see how they fair with the evil arts of Ommadon.
No, no! Most terrible!
What is it daughter?
What does your mind see?
A grasping hand, dark and fearsome.
To rob them of their will and courage.
To take their hearts and extinguish all hope.
A spell, an evil black magic spell.
Press on you say? What's the use?
- This cause is hopeless.
- Aye.
- We've killed a worm. What's that?
- Wait, what are you talking about?
I'm just a little man, but my foolishness is great.
I belong in the trees, the forest, not here!
My arrows, no matter how true what good are they here?
I don't believe my ears!
Fool! Trick back Carolinus to bring us here.
They are bewitched surly.
Listen, Peter of Beacon Street.
Listen to me, before it gets to you.
What?... Who?... A blue wizard?
Solarius!
Was the Shield of Saturn not given to you?
The shield?... Oh yes, Carolinus said...
It will protect you from Ommadon's spells.
Find the shield son, and drive this obscene force away.
Easy boy, easy!
Away! Away!
What's this?
How dare he?
How dare he?
Yes, Bryagh.
It's your turn now.
You and your legions.
Attack!
Demolish!
Devour!
Burn!
Grind them to dust!
Go forth and death be thy destination!
Doom. Doom.
A Flight of Dragons!
I COMMAND IT!
A FLIGHT...
OF DRAGONS!
Doom. Doom.
Doom. Doom.
- Look!
- Dragons!
Dozens of them. Hopeless.
It may be hopeless, but, I'll take a few of them before they get me.
- Let me take Bryagh.
- If I die, let me die a dragons killer.
No offense Gorbash, but I suddenly hunger for dragon.
Wait, we've got a chance.
Sir Orin, in your saddle pack, the tiny golden flute. Give it to Giles.
Now elf, pipe us a tune.
Quickly!
- And they are down, all the dragons.
- Destroyed?
- Asleep.
- But an enchanted sleep.
When they awaken, Ommadon spell over them will be broken.
They will join us!
The Red Crown of Ommadon may soon be ours.
Nay father, nay.
One still is awake.
Bryagh. Ommadon's power over him is stronger than Lo Tae Zhao's.
He has blood on his mind and can take them all.
Peter will fight him.
No, father. Peter being a dragon, now sleeps too.
Awaken old boy. We've won!
I've never seen such a sleep.
Puny scum of Carolinus!
Prepare to die!
No!
Oh my darling,...
Dead.
I'll crush you both, you filthy crawley!
Aah!
Giles, my darling Daniel, and Aragh too!
Blade, with whom I have lived.
Blade, with whom I now die.
Serve right at justice, one last time.
Seek one last heart of evil.
Still one last live of pain.
Cut well old friend, and then,... farewell.
Praying?
Now die.
I would have... lived a life with thee Lassy.
So now I die.
I am victorious.
Not quite yet.
Well, well, well.
The scientist!
And how did you shed dragon, filthy little man thing?
As Gorbash slept, I suddenly felt myself, Peter Dickenson.
And I thought, "Two things cannot occupy the same place at the same time."
And the moment I comprehended that...
Voilà.
I guess logic is stronger than magic.
Stronger than my magic?
Lo!
I... have gathered... the sum total... of the worlds evil... in one place.
And that place is me.
I am invincible!
No magic stronger!
I am the world and the world is Ommadon.
I can do anything.
Test me.
I can reach up and pluck down the Sun.
You can't do that.
Why, why you insect?
Why?
Seven heads and each one a simpleton.
Don't you know what you reach for isn't in that position anymore?
The Sun is the Sun!
- I can see where it is!
- Where it was pip-squeak!
Any school boy knows that light travels at 186,300 miles per second.
What you see is the Sun's position eight and a half minutes ago.
No magic but mine, can move the Sun.
I command it!
Not magic gas head, mathematics.
And that's the answer to why Antiquity chose me.
You are magic. Mere illusion.
I am science, logic, and the truth.
You don't frighting me.
Nothing so horrible could be real.
- I deny you!
- Deny me and you deny all magic.
Say it then!
I deny all magic!
Deny this...
Kimpacto... solauu... insomaa.
Eran... courant... palay.
Ocaun... eeoan.
Those incantations can't hurt me.
I have some incantations of my own.
How about,
A body in motion tends to stay in motion.
Protons have 1,832 times the mass of electrons.
All light is bent or refracted as it goes from one medium to another, in a direction perpendicular to the interface between the two mediums.
- AAH!
- Hallucinations may result from the selected actions of external conditions.
Upon the variations from their specific type which individual present,
Gravity varies as to the inverse square of the distance.
The velocity of light is equal to the wavelength times the frequency of vibration.
The geometrical properties of the space time continuum are determined by the masses present in space and time.
Come devils, witches, demons, ogres, trolls, sand rats, harpies, ghouls, sorcerers.
Come algebra, anatomy, astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology, geometry, mathematics, meteorology, neurology, oceanography, paleontology, physics, psychology, sociology, logistics, and so on. sociology, logistics, and so on.
AAAHH!
AAAHH!
Behold my darling, the magical realm.
And look.
It's Carolinus.
I am home.
We are home.
Well Gorbash, awake at last?
Aragh, I thought you were dead beneath the sea!
Old friend. Oh thank heaven you're still intact.
We've won, Sir Peter we've won!
I don't understand. Why the blazes do you call me by this man name?
- Gorbash?
- Of course Gorbash.
Why so shocked, Sir Orin?
You who practically hatched me.
Sir Peter, is gone.
Gone? Where?
As Carolinus hoped, he used his knowledge of science to deny magic.
But, by denying magic, he is lost to us forever.
- Father!
- Melisande! She's awake.
Father, Sir Peter was here.
- Yes, yes my darling.
- Look!
The Crown of Ommadon.
As foretold, it awaken you.
No, the kiss awakened me.
The kiss?
I was lost in that sleep of death.
Then I felt his lips upon mine.
I opened my eyes, and for an instant I saw his smile.
Then he was gone.
Awakened you with a kiss eh?
Well, perhaps he isn't completely lost to magic.
May, … May I join him father?
Of all questions, I feared that the most.
- May I?
- That must be your decision child.
Go, and you may never return to the Magic Realm.
For even now the great dome of invisibility grows over our world to protect its sanctity for all time.
And no one on the outside may enter its boundaries, save for the length of a dream or flash of an inspiration.
But it will stay through the years the centuries and the ages.
A part of man for all time.
And when ever man needs magic, we will be here.
Eleven!
You dragon fire melts my ice.
Oh, you win.
- Look, I gotta' get back to work.
- Wait a minute.
- I do have some business now.
- I told you that watch of yours...
Not the watch.
This.
Ye gods! Solid gold!
- Where did you find this?
- Oh, I had a hoard.
I don’t blame you for not telling.
You can live off this for years.
Travel, Europe, Asia, cruises.
No, I'll be satisfied with a cottage surround by trees near a stream.
Like one I used to know.
Oh, can I help you Miss?
Where do you kids get these things?
Melisande!

Bye.
Next, please.
Come on, come on.
Next.
Name.
Gus Gorman.
Ah, yes. August Gorman.
Have you looked for work this week?
- Yes.
- What kind?
- Kitchen technician.
- Dishwasher. Any luck?
No, but...
Mr. Gorman, according to our records, you've been unemployed for 36 weeks.
No, it's 35.
Not counting this week.
You secured employment in June as a messenger and were discharged afterâ€¦
- ... one day for losing...
- No, they said I lost it.
I did not lose it!
It was stolen by a pickpocket.
A television set?
It was a teeny-tiny, teeny-weensy
Japanese television set.
The other employment you found was in a fast-food joint, which lasted...
...28 minutes?
That's some kind of record.
Talk about fast.
Those people are crazy. They expect you to learn that stuff in one day.
"Hold the lettuce. Hold the ketchup.
Can I have some sauce, please?"
- Mr. Gorman...
- "Two buns. No buns. Some cheese."
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but...
I'm not the fault!
Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment.
Thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens.
- Do you know what you are?
- Don't call me a bum, I'm not a bum!
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
- Well, look...
- Next.
Wait. What about this week?
I need this week!
Next.
You mean, that's it?
"Finished," like "over"?
Next.
"Next" as in "bye."
Next!
Name.
Excuse me, brother, can I have a light?
- How you doing, Alex?
- Hi, Jimmy.
Huh? Ah.
Excuse me.
Say thank you.
Wow!
Way to go, Superman!
VOICE:
Your drink is on its way.
Sir.
Excuse me...
...but what if you wanna program two bilateral coordinates at the same time?
You can't do that. It's impossible.
- But if you can't...
- Oh, no.
Computer technology is very advanced, young lady, but it can't do that.
- But if you think we can't do it that way, what happens...?
Sir.
Good Lord.
How did you do that?
I don't know. I just did it.
- Who's this?
- That's him, Ross Webster.
- Just after he received the award for
Humanitarian of the Year.
He is good-looking.
Because I gave him f. 2 at a 50th.
One thing I don't understand...
...the point of the story Lois wrote is how Ross got this great honor...
...and you bring me one picture of him and 15 pictures of this other person.
- Who is she?
- Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's...
She's just Webster's.
Let's leave it at that.
- Who's this other woman?
- His sister, Vera Webster.
- Picture looks fuzzy.
- What?
The picture's fine, chief.
She looks like that in real life.
- She's VP of Webscoe Industries.
- I really don't understand you.
A boring banquet and you bring me
3000 boring pictures.
Yet Superman saves a man from drowning on Third Avenue...
...while you just stand there and you don't bring me one picture!
Chief, I didn't have my camera with me.
A photographer eats with his camera.
A photographer sleeps with his camera.
- I'm glad I'm a writer.
- Mr. White, please.
It's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number.
Prize is an all-expenses trip to South America.
- I don't know why the idiot in Circulation...
- Good morning.
- Hi, Clark.
- Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy.
You've got mustard on your lapel.
Excuse me, Mr. White,
I hate to interrupt...
Sorry. I'm busy.
I got a paper to get out here.
It'll never replace the printing press.
- What's the number, Mr. White?
- Fifty-three.
- Mr. White...
- Fifty-three!
- Mr. White...
- You've got to pull three more numbers.
I promised I'd call them back today.
What do you think?
- Well, I don't know, Kent...
- I think it'd make a terrific story.
What's a terrific story?
Kent's been invited to his high-school reunion.
- Say.
- Yeah.
Could we have the next number?
It's practically an
American institution. Isn't it?
I don't know, Mr. Kent. Most of the people I know are still in high school.
Thirty-three.
What I thought this story would be about, Mr. White, is...
Thirty-three.
...is how much the typical small town has changed in the last 15 years.
Take me, for example:
Can I really go back to middle America now as a Metropolis sophisticate?
I'm really excited about this.
In fact, I was looking around...
...in my closet last night...
...and I even found my old high-school sweater.
- Smallville.
- Mr. White.
Can I go ahead and make my travel plan?
Same question about mine.
Tell your people the prodigal son and his photographer are coming home.
Oh, gee, thanks, Mr. White.
It isn't easy for me to lose one of my best reporters.
- That's okay.
- You deserve the vacation, Lois.
Thank you.
Lois, are you going someplace?
Clark, you know some people get to go all the way to Smallville...
...and then there are others of us who have to go to Bermuda.
Golly.
- Bye.
- Bye, Miss Lane.
- Have fun.
- Mr. White, the next number, please.
Well, I guess I better be going too.
So I'll be going.
Bye.
Couldn't we get a computer to do this?
- Hey, what is this?
- First paycheck.
This is the first rip-off, man! We're supposed to get 225 a week, right?
This says, "$143.80."
How am I supposed to live on that?
State tax, federal tax, social security tax...
It's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
So I'm getting money when I...? 65?
I want mine now!
I want to enjoy it while I'm young.
I wanna get up and get down. Boogie.
Actually, it's probably more like
$143.80 and one half cent.
There are always fractions left over, but big corporations round it down.
What do I do with half a cent?
Buy a thoroughbred mouse?
Everybody loses those fractions?
They don't lose them.
You can't lose what you never got.
Then what happens?
The company gets them?
They can't be bothered collecting that from your paycheck any more than you.
Then what happens to them?
Well, they're just floating around out there.
The computers know where.
How many sugars?
One and a half.
It's quitting time, Gus. You coming?
Yeah. No, actually, I got some stuff to finish up, so...
Working overtime, huh? What are you doing, buddy? Looking for a raise?
Yeah, looking for a raise.
You bet.
- But my Uncle Al on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing.
He says it should be cooked on the outside.
She cooks it on the inside.
My mother told my Aunt Helen.
She's my father's half sister.
- I told you that, right?
- Yeah.
- And anyway, the family...
- Hey, hey.
- Look at that.
- Wow.
Okay, your choice:
You can turn back or pull over till it's over.
- How long will it take?
- Can't tell with these fires.
I mean, that fire...
That's spreading like wildfire.
It's just a building burning.
It's not just a building.
That's a chemical plant.
You know what I mean.
It's like... It's like chemicals.
If any of that stuff goes up in smoke, we're in for a hairy time around here.
- Clark.
- Yeah?
I want you to keep these people distracted.
What are you doing?
What am I doing?
Remember what the chief said?
A photographer always goes after a story.
That could be dangerous, Jimmy.
Danger goes with the territory,
Mr. Kent.
Help me!
- How can I help?
- Get this man a helmet.
- It's you. Forget the helmet.
- How bad is it?
My God, it's a nightmare. Everything's either explosive or flammable or worse.
Get the ladder truck in here.
- It won't reach.
- My God, they're trapped!
What's he gonna do?
Fly them down one at a time?
Let's go! Everybody, down there! Move it!
Come on! Hurry up!
There you go.
Right down there. Take it easy.
All right. Everybody down there!
Keep moving!
Sir, get out. I'll show you the quickest way.
Go on. Look after the others.
I can't leave.
- Why not?
- I gotta stay and look after those.
That's concentrated Beltric acid.
If that stuff heats up over 180 degrees, we've got a crisis...
...that'll make this fire look like a picnic.
What does it do?
- As long as it remains stable, it's just ordinary acid.
But if it begins to heat up, it'll turn volatile.
You'll get a great cloud of smoke that will eat through anything.
Steel, concrete, anything.
Who the hell is that?
- Hey, you! Get off of there!
- I'm just gonna get a couple more shots.
Ow! Ah!
Tell them to bring their hoses back here! Quickly!
Help!
Help! Help me!
Help! Somebody help me!
- Help!
- It's all right.
- Superman! My leg.
- I got you. Take it easy.
All right. We'll go nice and easy.
Okay, I'm sorry.
All right? Here we go.
Medics! Over here, please.
That's it. Here you go.
Go easy. It's the left leg.
- My camera.
- Yeah.
It's a clean break right across the fibula.
- My camera.
- Sorry, Jimmy. You'll be okay.
Get that fire out, otherwise there'll be an acid cloud all over the Eastern seaboard.
- The pump house is gone!
- What?
- The pump house!
- We've lost the water pressure!
- We've got to have water!
- How?
Lake Comooga's five miles from here.
We'd need a five-mile hose!
- Where's this lake?
- That way.
Tell them it's hopeless.
You told me we had an adequate water supply.
Water!
I tell you, that man's a miracle!
Carol, you got gorgeous!
Look at you.
- That was against Mid-City.
I'll never forget it.
Fourth quarter, score was tied...
...we're back at the 25-yard line.
Coach sends in a play,
Right Flanker Option.
You really have grown, Clark.
You look very well, Miss Bannister.
I can't complain. I take the stairs a little slow and I have these spells.
But really, I can't complain.
Lana?
Clark?
Would you excuse me? There's someone
I'd really like to say hello to.
Lana?
- Lana Lang? It's great to see you.
- Clark.
- You look wonderful.
- Me? No, you look...
- Let me give you a hand with that.
- No, no. I can manage.
Uh...
This is the first time you've come back since your mom passed away.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I heard that you and...
- ... Donald split up.
- Did you eat yet?
No.
Beg your pardon. Excuse me. Sorry.
- That's not right.
- No?
You're right about Donald and me, but... Hold this, okay?
Oh, sure.
Hi, Kent.
Hi. How you doing?
I'm sorry. I'm going nuts. Thanks.
- Clark.
- Yeah.
Lana.
Uh-oh. Um...
Hey, sweet.
Here I am.
Remember when you were prom queen?
All these guys were waiting for a dance?
There's only one guy on your dance card now. Huh, honey?
- That's good old...
- Brad Wilson.
- Hi, Brad.
- Hi, Kent.
Long time no see.
You know, see, see, see?
- Come on, Lana.
- No, I can't.
- Clark already asked me.
- I did?
- Yeah.
- Oh, excuse me.
Lana, I haven't danced...
Ah, Gorman.
Another week, another check.
Don't you have another one for me?
I put in a voucher for expenses.
What?
Yeah, yeah.
Here you go.
Ooo...
Thanks for helping me out.
You kidding? A lot of guys would like to be where I am.
You'd be surprised at how many offers I didn't get.
Even Brad wouldn't stick around.
It really isn't easy.
The streamers?
Yeah, you just pull, and...
No, not the streamers. Everything.
Not that I'm complaining.
It's just that...
...I don't know why,
I just feel like I can talk to you.
What?
I feel like I can talk to you!
- You can?
- Yes.
- You know something, Lana?
- What?
I always...
I always wished that you would.
I mean, even back in high school.
- Remember when you were...?
- Queen of the prom.
Then three years after the royal wedding, the king abdicated.
- Isn't that terrible?
- Yeah, sure is.
There must be a gallon of potato salad left over.
You know what the problem is?
I don't know, too much mayonnaise?
Donald loved mayonnaise.
Why would that be the problem?
No, the problem is, why do I stay in Smallville?
Believe me, I've asked myself that.
Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis? The Big Apricot.
Well, Lana, you could...
Easy to say. But how?
What about Ricky?
- Ricky?
- My little boy.
- You? Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.
I mean, at least here we have a house and I've got a job that pays the bills.
Except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up.
Yeah. Even had to pawn my diamond ring then.
That's a shame.
You never got married?
- Me?
- Yeah.
Well, I was...
No. Not...
You know, years later you can look at someone and think:
"Well, I guess that's the one that got away."
Give me that again, old buddy.
Run it by me just one more time.
- Eighty-five thousand dollars.
- Missing?
Embezzled, Mr. Webster.
Stolen from the firm.
By whom?
That's what I want to know.
By whom? Whom?
Vera, get a hold of yourself.
Nobody else ever will.
I don't know.
Whom?
In the old days it was simple.
We kept books, we knew what was going in and what was paid out.
If somebody wanted to rob you...
...they'd come in with a gun and say,
"Stick them up."
Now they get blasted computers to do their dirty work.
My old friend, you are yesterday.
Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.
Mr. Webster, it's time for your massage.
Does this woman have the right to burst in...?
Now, now, Vera. Simpson, you know my psychic nutritionist?
- Hello.
- We are trying to hold a meeting here.
Why don't you hold your breath instead.
Maybe you'll turn blue.
- Improvement.
- I'm about to take a human life.
Simpson, would you excuse us for a second, please?
- Mouths closed. Ears open.
- She's a big pig.
I can't have anyone with me who isn't with me.
Now, girls.
Simpson.
Well, old chum. What now?
Kiss the 85 thou goodbye?
Keep on paying the thief his salary until he shakes the money tree again?
- He's bound to slip up sooner or later.
- Why?
That's what they always say in the movies.
He won't slip up at all. No, not at all.
He'll keep quietly taking the bread from our mouths.
He'll keep a low profile and won't do a thing to call attention to himself.
Unless, of course, he is a complete and utter moron.
I'll go first. Andrew.
- I'll pick Chris.
- You feel good? You feel ready?
LANA
Ricky, your shoe.
- You mean, we've gotta take Ricky?
- You guys lost the toss.
All right, come on, Ricky.
- Wait, wait...
- Come on, good luck.
- I just can't stand this.
- Oh, Lana. It'll be okay.
I know, I was a late bloomer myself.
It's not just that he's small, he's the only kid in town without a father.
Oh, look. He's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
- Gee, all he had was chocolate milk.
- No, him.
Hey, sweet thing.
Little kid getting hassled, huh?
- Kent, you still here?
- I seem to be, Brad.
All he needs is a few pointers from the old champ here.
I won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row.
I didn't know that.
Yeah. Natural athlete can play any sport.
Brad, you're just gonna make it worse.
- It's all right. It'll be okay.
- He'll make it worse.
You watch, he'll get a spare.
Come on, Ricky.
Hey, kid, you're holding it all wrong.
- Let old Brad show you how it's done.
- Brad.
Excuse me. Say, Brad, I think maybe he'll be better off doing it his way.
For a guy lucky to be waterboy, you've got a big mouth.
I don't think he needs a lesson in front of the other kids.
- He needs a man to show him.
- He's doing just fine. Excuse me.
Here you go, Ricky.
And give it your best shot.
Okay? There you go.
Sorry.
Ah-choo!
Gesundheit.
Thank you.
Hey, Gus, the boss wants to see you.
He can see me all right.
Hello, Mr. Lewis.
No, not that boss. The boss.
- You mean, the boss...
- Yup.
- ... wants to see me?
- Yup.
Oh, my God, why would he wanna see me?
I mean...
Why would the boss wanna see me?
There's no reason.
Then why'd he...? Oh, I know!
It's my suggestion for the volleyball uniforms.
That's it.
Ross the boss.
Ross the boss. The boss!
Be calm. Be cool. Be collected.
Mr. Webster? Mr. Webster?
Mr. Webster, I did not... Mr. Webster.
Mr. August Gorman?
August Gorman here.
I know you're a man of compassion, and I don't wanna go to jail...
...because they have robbers and rapists...
I just wanna ask you one question.
You've been a naughty guy, haven't you?
Come on, admit it now.
You've been just a little bit naughty, haven't you?
- I was kind of...
- That's all right. I understand.
I can... What do the young folks say today?
"Dig where you're coming from, brother."
- You wanna be rich, right?
- How, wha...
I was born rich. Never worn the same pair of socks twice.
What do you do with your socks?
I don't know. They're laundered and sent to some charitable institution, I think.
Actually, I don't know.
Maybe they turn them into dust rags...
...or pen-wipers or something.
Or maybe socks.
Yes! That never occurred to me.
Gus, you know something?
You're a genius.
A naughty genius, but what the hell?
Nobody's perfect, right? Cheers.
Because of the half-cent thing with the computers.
No, no, because computers rule the world today.
The fellow that can fool the computers can rule the world himself.
I've been searching for somebody who can make these machines...
...do what they're not supposed to.
Get my drift?
- Yes!
- Gus...
...Webscoe, the Webscoe industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel.
Some magnesium here, some zinc there.
Railroads, farm machinery.
You follow me?
I follow you, sir.
- Gus, do you know what I want now?
- No.
I want coffee.
All right. Black, cream, sugar, or...?
No, you don't seem to understand.
Under different company names,
I control the price of coffee beans...
...in Venezuela, Brazil, Bolivia,
Jamaica and the Republic of Gabon.
But I've got a problem and I think maybe you can help me.
One country won't play ball with me.
You know how that can bug a guy, right?
That could bug... What country?
- Colombia.
- Colombia?
Colombia has two important exports, and one of them's coffee.
And I've tried to reason with them.
Believe me, I've tried.
But this one miserable, pissant little country...
...has the gall to think it can dictate the economy of an open market. Gus.
Gus, my friend...
...we're going to teach them a lesson, aren't we?
Destroy the entire
Colombian coffee crop...
...right down to the last bean.
- The last bean, we are.
- Right.
But you got so much. You know, like...
A wise man once said,
I think it was Attila the Hun:
"It is not enough that I succeed.
Everyone else must fail."
Seems fair.
- Gus.
- What?
You are going to do this for me.
- How?
- The weather.
You didn't say your mother was here.
I'm his sister. His baby sister.
Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?
Hi, Ms. Vulcan.
Vulcan is the weather satellite our government put up...
...to monitor the weather.
But if somebody were to reprogram it, it could do much more.
It could make weather.
Storms and floods.
Blizzards, heat waves.
How do you do that?
Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus.
You push buttons.
- There you go.
- It's the first time I won anything.
You won my hand, Maury.
But this is the first time
I won anything valuable.
Let's get one with the sombreros.
Mr. White, you'll be in this, handing them their plane tickets.
- Why do I have to do this?
- Why do I have to do this?
You're lucky I didn't fire you.
I get a chance at exclusive photos...
...of history's biggest factory fire.
He comes home with a broken leg and 12 melted rolls of film.
It was hot.
Smile, Mr. White.
South America!
I can't believe my luck!
See, if you don't want them to trace it back...
...you've gotta punch in to some little rinky-dink outfit...
...that has a little
Mickey Mouse computer...
Someplace you can sneak into, right?
Somebody could...
Someplace where nobody knows him so they can't connect him with us.
Webscoe has 112 subsidiaries.
They're all linked into the central computer system.
How about someplace...
...small?
- Smallville. This is Smallville.
We'll have a five-minute stop here.
Mind your step.
Watch your step, please.
Thanks, Selma.
Thanks a lot, Lana.
Have a good day, now.
Let me help you, Lana.
I'm sorry.
- Thanks, Clark.
- Sit down, Buster. Good boy.
- Come on, Buster, sit down.
That's a good boy.
Okay. You all set? Great.
Wow.
I'm not saying another word.
That's it. Okay?
Jesus Christ!
Don't they have picnics in Metropolis,
Mr. Kent?
Well, not quite like this, Ricky.
- Mom and I do this all the time.
- You do?
- I'll help you.
- Stay close by and be careful, okay?
Okay, Mom.
- Come on, Buster. Let's find you a rabbit. Come on. Rabbit.
- This is so nice for him.
- Here you go.
It's even nicer when there's a man around, which isn't that often.
- There's a lot of choices.
- The good ones are married.
That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women.
He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one asking.
No, Lana, I meant there's a lot of choices here.
This is really quite some picnic.
There's...
...some of that.
Green stuff.
Hey, pâté.
Boy, this pâté is really unusual.
I didn't make any... Oh, Clark.
That's Buster's dog food.
- It's good.
- Don't eat it!
What time's the dog eat?
- This is nice.
- Here.
It's all right, Lana.
Thanks.
Hey, where you going? Come on!
Buster, stop messing about!
- How much longer...?
- I was just thinking...
- I'm sorry. No, go ahead.
- No. You.
Well...
...I was just thinking that...
...somebody like you could do really well in Metropolis.
I suppose I have to face it. I'm not gonna find what I want in Smallville anymore.
Could I make it in Metropolis?
What would I do when I got there?
Call me.
- No, I wouldn't wanna call you.
- You don't wanna call me?
Yes, I wanna call you, but I wouldn't wanna be a nuisance to you.
I don't think you could ever be a nuisance to me, Lana.
Clark, may I tell you something?
My oil pan is leaking.
See? There's something dripping.
- Can I give you a hand?
- No, thanks.
With all the car trouble I have,
I studied up on auto repair.
Look at this.
Oh, boy.
Lana, I think I'll just go see if Ricky's all right. You okay?
Yeah.
Gosh, is he all right?
Hi.
Superman?
That's me.
Mom! Mom!
There you go. He's all right, but have a doctor check him.
Thank you.
- I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
- Nice to meet you.
And this is Clark.
I really have to be going.
So long, Ricky. Bye.
We were flying, Mom!
What were you doing, anyway?
I was looking for Buster.
- Buster! Buster!
- I found him!
Come on, boy. That's it.
Mr. Kent, Superman was here!
- What?
- Yes, he really was.
Aren't you excited?
I'm from Metropolis.
I see Superman every day.
You do? Could you get me his autograph?
I don't know. If I had a nickel for every time some little kid...
Yeah? What do you want?
We're in big trouble, aren't we?
- What?
- We're in big trouble.
First, they lost the invoice.
When they found it, they realized they came up short on a few items.
So I rented a car because I missed the plane from Cleveland. 4:00, you know.
And a flat tire on the highway.
What a kicker.
Had to fix it myself with these little pinkies.
And I figured your boss was gonna be real peeved, you know what I mean?
What do you mean?
He is going to hang our butts against the wall.
He wanted this special order installed...
...in his office no later than tomorrow morning.
Let me in because
I gotta set it up tonight.
Get all what set up?
Pal, you are a real lifesaver.
I mean, a real lifesaver.
- Which way's the office?
- Straight on ahead.
- Follow me.
- I'm right behind you.
Oh, yeah.
Not bad. It's pretty good.
You know what's wrong with this Singapore wing?
Sling! Singapore Sling.
What's wrong with it?
There's not enough vodka in it.
There's no vodka in it!
What did I tell you?
Put some vodka in it.
What did you...? You know.
- Yeah.
- There's vodka in it now, buddy.
Yeah, perfect.
- You never do pass out, do you?
- Nope.
Never.
Job well done, buddy.
You thought I was drunk too, didn't you? Ha, ha.
Fooled you.
Get the keys, get the keys.
Somebody's drunk.
Hello, baby!
How's the little baby?
Okay.
All right, let's get down to it.
Let's do it.
One, two, button your shoe.
"Both keys at the same time"?
Whoa.
Wait. Wait a minute.
Think you've won, don't you?
The Philly Flash!
Okay, ready?
One, two, three!
Yeah. Now we'll see what we'll see.
Oh.
Oh...
Oh.
Come on, please.
There it is!
Hello! Now...
...getting down to business.
I am a genius.
I am a...
Longitude...
...and the other thing. Latitude, right?
Oh, look, Maury. A native wedding.
No one said at the Daily Planet that this was the rainy season!
- Meteorologists are baffled by the tornado and rainstorms...
...that struck the country of Colombia this afternoon...
...threatening to destroy the nation's entire coffee crop for the next five years.
Gale-force winds up to...
...an incredible 250 miles an hour lashed the countryside...
...while 12 inches of rainfall have already been recorded in just one day.
A spokesman for the Department of
Meteorology said this was, I quote:
"The most awesome display of natural forces since Noah's ark."
If I laugh any harder, I'll split my sides!
...to defy all laws of weather systems known to science.
What a shame.
Poor little Colombia. Well...
I'm gonna get you for that, you big silly!
Bubba, do you realize what we're on to?
Do I?
Every time a drunk sobers up, he'll drink Webster coffee.
Why stop at coffee?
A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning.
But what keeps the world working?
Diet soda?
Vera, you mean...? You mean...?
Today, coffee.
Tomorrow, the oil!
- Oil?
- If Gus can push the right buttons...
I can have it all. Holy cats!
All the oil.
All the pumps.
All the tankers.
This is some nifty idea, Vera.
- Boss?
- Very nifty.
- Just the man I want to see.
- Boss, it is not my fault.
Isn't it neat? There...
- What's not your fault?
- Superman.
How was I to know he was gonna start doing his thing...
...when you started doing your thing?
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talk...?
It was just on television, man.
Didn't you see it?
Don't call me "man."
I just saw Colombia bite the dust. That's all.
You didn't see the man come flying out of the sky from the clouds? It was him!
With his cape flapping in the...
His cape was flapping in the wind!
He was flying! He was great!
He was just flying around...
His cape was blowing in the wind like this. It looked like a flag!
And he landed right in the middle of this big plantation!
And he checked everything out with his x-ray vision.
And then he put these laser beams out of his eyes onto everything.
Straight-out laser points.
Dried up everything!
Just like that!
I'm talking about drying it up, like machines in the men's rooms.
You know what I mean?
Hot air comes out when you put your hands under.
Sometimes they don't work, right?
But Superman's worked!
You think he stood around to take bows? Not this man.
No, sir. He flies off again. Right?
Then he saw what really caused the trouble.
He flew into the tornado...
...went down to the bottom of it, and turned it upside down!
He made the little end on top and the big end on the bottom!
I was gonna go crazy!
I've never seen nothing like it.
The big end was on the bottom.
Little end on the top.
Mr. Ross, it was... The big...
Superman's bad.
I'll say he was.
I mean, he was bad!
No.
No!
Here, let me help.
- It was a perfect plan. It was foolproof!
- And we were the fools.
It's not my fault.
I did what I was supposed to do.
He ruined it.
That lousy do-gooder ruined it.
Now that he's pulled off this stunt, he'll try and ruin my oil scheme too.
- I've got to get rid of him.
- How?
Shoot him? You know about him and bullets.
- Kryptonite.
- What?
Or krypton-ham, or krypton-heimer?
I forget what you call it, but it's stuff that can hurt Superman.
- How would you know about that?
- I know a few things.
I know, from the graffiti I saw.
Wait a second.
She's right.
Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him.
Where does it come from?
- The same planet Superman came from: Krypton.
Where is Krypton?
It's nowhere.
It blew up in space, years ago.
They sent Superman here from there when he was just a baby.
I know some things too.
Wait a minute. You know what happens when a planet explodes.
- Debris. Things floating in space.
- So?
So all we have to do is find out where in heaven Krypton used to be.
Then we get good old Gus to contact the Vulcan satellite.
Old Gus has been doing some thinking.
Good. That's why I keep you around.
Yeah. I've been thinking that I'm not making enough money for this gig.
Gus, if there's anything I hate...
...it's greed.
Greed? Mr. Ross, just a minute.
Let me tell you something.
I can't ski!
- Once Gus contacts the Vulcan satellite...
...he orders it to search through space...
...around where Krypton went bye-bye.
Then the laser probe locks on to a floating chunk of Kryptonite.
The computer analyzes the components...
...and the boys at the lab duplicate the stuff down here.
"Unknown"?
"Unknown"?
What the hell, he ain't gonna smoke it.
Mr. White can't be responsible.
Where is he?
Please, Mr. Stokis.
He'll pay for this.
Get out your wallet!
- Good morning.
- Don't you "good morning" me.
"Old, old relationships suddenly seem very much the same.
The prettiest girl in the school..."
...is still the prettiest girl in the school.
- Hello?
- Hello. Oh, hi, Clark.
Lana! Hi, I was just thinking about you.
Oh, um...
Listen, I have a problem with Ricky.
Why? What happened to Ricky?
It's Superman's autograph you got him.
He got carried away...
...and told the kids Superman was coming on his birthday.
Okay, it was wrong...
...but when Wednesday comes and
Superman doesn't show, it's gonna...
Well, Lana, in this case I think
I can go ahead and speak for Superman.
I mean, he and I are pretty close, you know.
And you can tell Ricky that Superman will be there on Wednesday, all right?
Well, he's gonna get the best home-cooked meal he's had...
...in a long time.
- Tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
- All right.
- But, Clark...
- Yeah?
...you're the best.
And I'll take it to the Supreme Court if I have to.
But it wasn't our fault.
It was an act of God.
In a church?
Hey!
Here's that compound you ordered.
Can't imagine what you want with it.
But you got it.
What the hell am I afraid for?
I'm from Earth.
Lana, I really wasn't expecting all this.
I guess they did get a little carried away.
Superman, we all know...
...that you're not looking for honors and awards.
But when we heard that you were coming to see your pal Ricky...
...we realized that this was our chance to say thank you.
First, for putting out the Lake Comooga fire.
And not least, for saving little Ricky.
So since you already have the key to our hearts...
...Superman...
...may I present you with the key to the city.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
As you were.
Now listen up.
I just came in directly...
...from the Pentagon...
...and you better believe there's a damn good reason that I did.
Because God has given us...
...one of the greatest gifts in the world:
Chemicals.
Now, you people, you like to go sit in church on Sunday, don't you?
You like to sit and watch the Super Bowl.
Yeah.
Sit on what?!
You sit on molded, plastic seats!
Molded to your well-fed behinds.
Now, I don't have to tell you that America leads the world...
...in high-grade plastics.
We cannot afford a chemical-plastics gap.
Now, listen to me.
Do you want...
...our president of the United States sitting down...
...to write a peace treaty...
...and have his ballpoint pen bust open...
...and the ink run out all over his nice, clean pants...
...in front of the world leaders?
No. No.
Now, we all know...
...that last week, half of this great nation of ours...
...almost bit the bullet...
...if it wasn't for this man here.
And all I can say is, thank the Lord for Superman.
Superman, you saved our bacon...
...and I'd like to show our gratitude.
This is a small token of our appreciation...
...to show to you for saving us from a chemical-plant disaster.
Thank you very much, general.
This is very nice. Thank you.
It's very nice.
Unknown. How am I supposed to know what "unknown" means?
It means unknown. It means nobody knows what it means.
- Hello, boss?
- Gus?
- Gus Gorman here.
- I know that. How did it go?
You know how they're always trying to find the secret recipe...
...in that chicken in the bucket?
And nobody seems to know the ingredient...
...because it's unknown, right?
In the Kryptonite there was an unknown element and Superman didn't die.
He didn't die.
I ask you to kill Superman...
...and you're telling me you couldn't even do that one simple thing.
Hello?
He hasn't had an afternoon nap for years.
This is the biggest day of his life.
I don't know how to thank you.
You did with that wonderful lunch.
Oh, well, I do like to cook.
- You'll take some coffee?
- Yes, please.
- Decaffeinated, of course.
- Right.
Hello? Yes.
What?
Oh, really?
Yeah, he's here.
I'll tell him.
Okay, thanks. Bye-bye.
Superman, that was my friend Betty.
There's an accident on the bridge.
A trailer crashed through the rail.
It's hanging off the bridge and the driver's in the cab.
I'm sorry.
I hate to make you rush off.
Well, there's no rush.
- But the bridge...
- It's okay. I always get there on time.
Come on, let's relax a little.
It's unusual finding a good-looking girl like you alone like this.
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
What bridge?
You're right.
I have to get going.
Get him out of there. Come on.
Get him out! Get him out quick!
Come on. Get him away.
That thing's gonna go.
Everybody okay? Joe?
What can I do to help?
Not much of anything now.
If only you'd got here a minute sooner.
"At a special session of the General Assembly...
...178 countries voted to censure Superman...
...with only Colombia abstaining."
I can tell you one thing.
He wasn't so mean and nasty the other day in Smallville.
In fact, he was so full of niceness...
...I hated laying that big chunk of...
Kryptonite. Don't you see?
That stuff we ran off in the lab wasn't a complete failure after all.
Right after Gus gave it to him, he started to turn into...
...an ornery, evil, malicious, selfish...
- A normal person.
- Yes.
And now that Superman is out of the nice-guy business...
We can get to work on that oil.
- And now, the supreme moment, as the last runner...
...the one given the great honor of lighting the ceremonial flame...
...runs the last leg of a marathon that began seven days ago...
...as this torch has been passed from athlete to athlete...
...for 970 miles...
...across the country.
How can he say that pure categories have no objective meaning...
...in transcendental logic?
What about synthetic unity?
Hi, honey! Am I in your way?
- Stick around, you may learn something.
- Hi, Lorelei.
All the oil tankers in the world are totally controlled by computers.
They tell them where to go, how much oil to pick up...
...and where to deliver it.
Don't they have captains on these ships?
Yes, but they don't need them.
That's a throwback to some sentimental, seafaring baloney.
- You will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area...
...in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
And do what?
And do nothing.
Just sit there.
How are all the people gonna get their oil?
You catch on fast, old buddy.
Every oil pump in America is run by...
- Computers. I know.
- Will you stop interrupting?!
I'm sorry.
You will command the pumps to stop pumping.
- Then I want you to program one special command...
...into all these systems.
Tell them these orders are irreversible.
So it would be impossible for anybody to switch them back.
Can you do this for me, old buddy?
Old pal?
You know, you get your way all the time.
And it's not right.
I wanna know when I get a taste.
I think you've already had a taste of freedom, haven't you?
Or would you prefer jail?
You can't run that jail number on me.
Because I know I mean more to you out here doing things for you...
...than sitting in jail doing nothing for nobody.
I see.
What do you want?
What? A wastebasket?
No. These are plans.
Blueprints.
- For what?
- A computer.
- We've already got computers.
- No, not like this.
There's not a computer like this in the whole world anyplace.
It doesn't exist. You see...
...we have to build it.
What will it do?
Anything I tell it.
What will it do for me?
For you? It will do anything you tell me to tell it to do for you.
Wow.
Tell me.
- First of all, if anyone attacks this machine or anything...
...the computer counterattacks it.
I mean, it finds their weaknesses and wipes them out.
Right, old buddy.
You deal with my oil and I'll build you your machine.
Okay, I'll do it.
But I'm not so sure about this irreversible business.
They all kind of went...
What the hell?
That's it. The last tanker.
They're all mine now. All mine.
Yay.
Not quite.
What's that in the upper-middle quadrant?
It's a tanker.
And it's going the wrong way.
Skipper?
There it is again.
"Proceed immediately to...
...latitude 30 north, longitude 45 west.
There await further orders."
Hell, that's the middle of the Atlantic.
I'm not taking my ship there just to await further orders...
...no matter what that says.
We're supposed to go to Metropolis, and we're going to Metropolis.
All right.
That's where she is. Yeah.
Come on, get it up there.
OFFICER:
Miss?
Miss, can you hear me?
Listen, we are here to help you.
Don't jump. I repeat, do not jump!
Thought you'd never get here.
Don't expect me to save you.
I don't do that anymore.
Don't worry.
I'm long past saving.
Well...
...don't let me keep you from anything.
I'm not in a rush.
What did you have in mind?
Lots of things.
Oh, yeah?
Ooo...
If you'll just do me one little favor first.
What's that?
Well...
See, there's this little boat...
...and it's not going where it's supposed to go and...
Stop all engines!
Stop all engines!
Hi.
How about a little après-ski?
Champagne?
Take your turn like everybody else!
Stop it!
He's coming over here, Martha.
Don't you do that!
Don't! Please!
Hit him with your handbag!
Help me! Please, help me.
Somebody's beating up my husband.
- I've gotta call the police.
- Jack, go with her, okay?
The third one today, and at night it's worse.
Somebody's behind this.
You can't tell me there's no oil.
You can't say someone's not getting rich off this.
Someone's always getting rich.
You know who suffers? The small guy.
- The East Coast gets the brunt of the spill.
No, I cannot go out with you tonight.
No. I'm busy tomorrow night too.
Oh, yeah? Doing what?
I'll think of something. Look...
- ... I gotta go. Ricky needs me.
- Lana.
Brad, please stop calling me.
I've told you!
Well, you listen to me, huh?
You better start appreciating old Brad.
What else you got in Smallville?
What else have I got in Smallville?
I think I got the right answer.
So do I.
Smallville Airport, what flights do you have to Metropolis tomorrow?
- Where do I put this?
- Over there.
- Where do you want this?
- Put it up there.
Are you kidding? I'm not going in there.
Hey, hey. Come on.
Just leave him alone.
I can't get through.
Something's happening.
Hey, look! Superman's drunk!
- I wanna see what's happening here.
- Ricky. Ricky!
- Ricky.
- Yeah, that's right.
- Thank you.
- It's a disgrace, that's what it is.
I'll tell you, nobody's ever gonna trust that creep again.
He's washed up.
What are you looking at? Huh?
Excuse me. Superman? It's me, Ricky.
Ricky from Smallville.
Tell them you won't hurt anybody!
He's changed.
No! Maybe he's just sick.
Superman, please get better!
He's not listening to you.
Yes, he is. He can hear me.
He's got super-hearing.
Superman, you're just in a slump!
You'll be great again!
You can do it, Superman!
Superman, you can hear me, can't you?
Superman, you're just in a slump.
You'll be great again.
You can do it, Superman.
Superman, you can hear me, can't you?
He's gone nuts!
Come on!
I can give as good as I get.
Oh, yeah? All right, come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!
What's the matter, Kent?
Too warm for you, huh?
Come on, chicken! Come and get me.
You've been on my nerves a long time!
You always wanted to fly, Kent.
Now's your chance.
Skipper!
God, would you look at that!
- Miss Lorelei Ambrosia isn't at home right now.
But if you'd care to leave a message...
...why not deliver it to her in person?
So you've finally shown your true colors.
Well, if you're looking for us, here's where you'll find us.
Do drop in.
Wow, this is fun!
Fun? The fun's just starting.
Wait till Superman finds us, then you'll see some fun.
Wait, you gonna mess with Superman?
- Let's go. I want to be ready for him when he falls into our trap.
I just don't see why you can't balloon down like the rest of us.
Well...
No way.
I just don't believe a man can fly.
Watch out, horsy!
Don't, don't, don't.
Just don't try to fly.
Don't try to fly!
Will you get out of my way!
- Hurry! Hurry up!
- I am hurrying.
- I can't see anything.
- Turn on the light.
- Where's the light switch?
- Where do you usually find it?
- I don't know.
I guess I'll check the doorway.
God, it's pitch-black in here.
Oh, that's better.
Wow, what a jukebox!
I told you, didn't I?
There. The ultimate computer!
It does everything a computer can do and 1000 things none of them can do.
Let's give it a dry run.
- Wait a minute.
We've gotta wait for Gus.
Who needs Gus?
- He's the only one who can operate it.
- Like fish he is!
I know enough about computers to put a Ph. D. to shame.
Come now, brother dear, you didn't think...
...I was gonna let that little man run the show, did you?
Why don't peons tidy up when they're done?
Come on, Bubba, it's showtime.
Engage those buttons to activate the alpha circuit...
...and lock the modular grid.
You! Activate circuits 29 through W-7...
...and start full-power coordinates on exterior defensive systems.
In other words, push this red button.
How did you know about that?
He's here!
- Good. Let's give him something to worry about.
Now, let's see...
Tracking systems locked.
Let the games begin.
Don't tense up now, honey.
- Come on, Bubba, you're wasting your rockets.
Come on, Superman!
Let him have it, Ross.
Bubba, keep firing.
Keep him occupied while I get the MX ready.
What the hell is going on?
- You keep your rockets coming.
He won't notice the missile till too late!
So much for your catlike reflexes.
Oh, God!
Ha, ha!
No more. Look, you sit.
Sit, sit!
Help!
Hello? Forget you, jackass!
That's him out of the way.
Sis, how would you like to control all the world's weapons systems?
Baby!
It's Daddy!
Hey, what are you doing with my baby?
Gus, old buddy, genius.
Come up and join the fun.
He's still coming.
Arm the inner defenses.
All right, the game's over.
Hi, honey.
I don't know you, lady.
But the other night...
I'm sorry, but that wasn't me.
That guy's gone.
And you're next, Webster.
- Never underestimate the power of computers.
How do you like it?
- I think it's typical of people like you, Webster.
Instead of helping others, the four of you just wanna help yourselves.
Four of you?
You mean, us? Four? Wait...
Hey, man!
That's only his last name.
He likes to be called "Superman."
See, I'm not with them, Superman.
You could've fooled me, mister.
That's very good.
- Let's see how long he can carry on without any air.
He's still coming!
He's going to get me!
Don't bet on it!
You're hurting him.
- That's Kryptonite!
- Yes.
- This time we got it right!
- You're a genius.
You've invented a machine that can find anybody's weak spot.
Congratulations, old buddy.
You'll go down in history as the man who killed Superman!
I'm... No.
Superman!
No!
- Where do you think you're going?
- Never mind.
- Turn the power up.
- Hasn't he had enough?
Turn it up!
Power! More power!
Whoa!
Ow!
Seventy-five. Current 7.75.
There's a current level of 7 that is not supposed to be on bar...
Oh, here it is!
What's going on?
I don't know. The power's gone.
Gus must have pulled the plug out.
It worked.
It worked! I got it!
What have you got?
- Give me that screw.
- This screw?
- That screw.
- Never!
Hey, wait. I can't see.
What?
Holy...!
No! Make it stop!
I can't! It's out of control!
But how? Where's it getting the power from?
It's feeding itself.
It wants to live!
It's this thing here. We'll go to the zoo.
I'll do that tomorrow, and then we'll go on to the...
- What's happening?
- It's okay, Ricky.
Put the lights on!
Stop it! You're killing him!
Stop it!
Hey. Put me down!
Don't leave us alone in here! Superman!
Oh, I get it.
The coaxial energy shaft is engaging the grid source factor. Right.
We're through, frogface.
I'm splitting.
Hey, wait a minute!
Girls. Girls, come out of there!
Help me! Please!
Sis?
Oh, my God.
What is that?
Lorelei!
Sis, it's your Bubba!
Help me. Help!
Superman!
Honey!
Honey, I'm stuck here! Help!
What about me?
Look out!
Bubba?
Thank you, brother.
Regular or premium?
She hasn't had a drink in so long, give her a tankful of the good stuff.
How you doing?
Please don't talk to me.
I'm having enough trouble hanging on.
Okay, we'll go slow.
You're perfectly safe.
I'm not gonna argue with you.
I mean, any man who can trick my machine can do anything.
How did you beat my defenses?
Those defenses are good as long as it didn't know it's in trouble.
This time it didn't see the danger.
I went in with plain old acid.
It didn't know that when acid gets hot, it'll eat through anything.
- Watch the trees.
- Whoa!
I guess it died of acid indigestion.
But what's gonna happen to Ross and the ladies?
They're gonna have to see the police.
It's not your problem anymore.
Are we in Metropolis yet?
Nope. We're just gonna make a little stop right over there.
Whoa!
We're on the ground, Gus.
Morning.
- You okay, Supe?
- I'm fine.
Excuse me a second.
Can you guys spare one of these?
- Sure, Superman.
- It is Superman, isn't it?
Are you kidding? Is that...?
Didn't you see us fly out of the sky?
We're the only two men who can fly.
"Is it Superman?"
Just right.
Okay, Gus, let's go.
I was afraid you'd say that.
I thought I'd take the bus.
Well, suit yourself.
Does your boss have a computer here?
Yeah, he got a little bitty one about that big.
You tell him he can do a lot worse than to give Gus Gorman here a job.
Wow, thank you, Supe.
Take care.
I'll see you around.
So long.
Take it easy, man.
Well, you got good references, so if you want that job...
Nah, this is not for me.
I think I'll take that bus.
Can you tell me where the bus station is?
Yeah, about nine, 10 miles over there.
Nine or 10 miles. Okay.
Hey. You really flew with him?
Superman? Have you ever seen Superman before?
No.
Oh, you don't know about me and him?
Me and Superman?
Yeah, we go way back together.
We always, usually, sometimes, we...
Nine or 10 miles?
I think I'll walk.
Yeah, I'll walk.
Yeah.
Clark.
What a nice surprise! Come in.
- Gosh. Hi, Mr. Kent.
- Hi, Ricky.
- Guess who Mom's having dinner with.
- Who?
Superman!
Yeah, that's what I came to tell you.
Superman said to tell you he's sorry...
...but he's run into a problem and he won't be able to have dinner with you.
- I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
- Yeah.
Would you mind settling for me?
Any day.
- I'll get my things.
- Okay.
You know, Lana, I was talking to Superman the other day.
You know, he and I, we talk a lot.
And he felt badly about you having to pawn your diamond ring.
Well, he found...
He found this one just lying around.
He wanted you to have this.
Wow, a ring from Superman!
- It's okay. I got it.
- Sorry.
Look at that.
- Oh, Clark.
- It's okay.
It fits.
It looks really pretty.
Thank you.
Well...
- Brad.
- Brad.
Son of a bitch.
Kent, I hate you.
I've always hated you.
- You know why?
- No.
- Because you're nice.
- Not really.
And nice guys finish last.
Lois, I've got to hand it to you.
Who else could turn a vacation into a story...
...that'll blow the lid off of corruption in the Caribbean?
I knew I was on to something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.
Lois, you're terrific.
I have to be. Seems I've got some new competition.
Hmm?
The story that you wrote on the class reunion?
- I thought it was terrific.
- Thanks.
And fascinating. I liked the part about the little girl back home.
I'll take you to lunch and you tell me about it.
I'd love to, but I'm having lunch with Mr. White's new secretary.
- Hi, Lana.
- Hi, Clark.
Lana. Lois, say hello to Lana Lang,
Smallville's newest gift to Metropolis.
I'm glad to meet you.
I like your writing a lot.
Thank you.
I like your sparkler a lot.
Me too. I couldn't believe it when Clark gave it to me.
- Clark gave it to you?
- Yes.
Mr. White.
Mr. White, look what I've got for you.
People, I am in love with this machine!
Mr. White, excuse me, but I have a couple of errands to run before lunch.
- Go ahead, Mr. White.
- Where's the handle?
There is no handle.
You just push the button.
Jonathan Brisby was killed today while helping with the Plan.
It is four years since our departure from NIMH
and our world is changing.
We cannot stay here much longer.
Jonathan was a dear friend.
I am lost in knowing how to help his widow.
She knows nothing of us, or the Plan.
Perhaps best that I do nothing at present.
I shall miss him.
Johnason.
Wherever you are.
Your thoughts must comfort her tonight.
She'll be waiting, and you will not return.
Farewell... my friend.
Mr. Ages?
Mr. Ages, is anybody home?
Go away!
Mr. Ages!
What is it?
Mr. Ages, may I please speak to you?
What?
I said, may I please speak... with you.
Oh, thank goodness
I'm so glad you're home.
Confounded machine!
You never know when it's going to up and blow!
Yes.
I don't suppose you would remember me..
Yes, you're Mrs. Brisby.
And I am sorry about your husband's death.
Now if you'll excuse me...
Mr. Ages!
Great Jupiter woman, what do you want?
Mr. Ages, I know you don't like visitors but this is an emergency!
Please!
Madam, that is an emergency.
Oh Mr. Ages, my son Timothy is so sick!
Timmy? The one with the spider bite?
Oh, just give him some pepsissiwa root and...
No!
No, he's sick with a fever!
Well... I suppose I could fix up something...
Oh thank you!
Follow me, but don't touch anything!
Understand?
I do appreciate it...
Just how high is his fever?
He's burning hot to the touch.
Yes.
He's soaking wet with perspiration...
Yes?
And there's a raspy sound when he breathes.
A raspy sound you say? Well..
Does he have a chill?
Yes, he does.
Have you wrapped him in a blanket?
Yes.
Now step inside, but keep your hands to yourself!
I'm right in the middle of... something very important.
I understand.
Oh, do you?
Look at this mess...
Oh, shoo, shoo, go on!
- Your son has pneumonia.
- Pneumonia?
It's not uncommon, but you can die from it.
Oh please dear God, no.
Your son must stay in bed.
Bundle him up.
Yes.
- Not to go outside...
- But how long must...
Three weeks.
He cannot be moved for at least three weeks.
But Moving Day is nearly here!
- You asked my advice, and I gave it to you!
- I'm sorry.
He must stay in bed.
Now, mix this... this powder in a broth and make him drink it.
It'll bring down the fever.
Oh, bless you sir!
And bless yourself, you'll need it.
Now, you must excuse me...
You know the way out.
Oh, of course.
Thank you once again...
Shoo shoo shoo. Go on now. Go on.
Thank you so... much. Goodbye.
Is everything all right here?
What the... Oh! Lady, don't sneak up on me like that!
I didn't mean to frighten you...
Oh, you didn't frighten me, I was just sort of... working out.
You just broke my concentration, that's...
You look more like you're all tangled up.
Er, yeah
I guess that's enough exercise for one day.
Besides, I'm really after this terrific string!
I'm working on a love nest for two.
You know what I mean?
Oh I see... you have a girl.
Well, not really, I mean...
I haven't found Miss Right yet.
But when I do the whole world will hear us singing...
Excuse me, pardon me.
Well, you keep making all that noise and Dragon will hear you.
If he hasn't already.
Wouldn't you sing too? I mean if you felt... heh heh... if you felt the call of the wild, but...
I would... I would not if I knew there was a cat nearby.
But..
But SHE'S out there... somewhere... and when I find her I'll feel it way down in my wishbone!
I... What cat?
Dragon! He belongs to Farmer Fitzgibbons.
Look towards the house. See if you can see him.
Come back down here!
He'll see you for sure up there!
Hey, there's a cat out there!
Quiet! Does he see you?
No.
Yes!
Stand perfectly still.
Everything's fine... he's headed right for us.
Don't panic! Fast or slow?
Medium. Make that fast. Very f...
I have to go now! Excuse me, I really...
Break!
Oh my goodness.
It's a rabbit!
Well of all the silly nincompoops!
You got yourself all worked up over a rabbit!
You should have seen yourself!
Will you keep quiet?
You were scared stiff!
A rabbit! I knew it all along!
Will you hush up?
Admit it! You were scared!
Oh... fiddlesticks. Hold still.
If I had actually been near a cat,
I'd be sneezing my brains out.
See, I'm allergic to ca...
I'm allergic to caaaaa...
I'm allergic to caaaaa...
I'm allerg... AHHH-CHOOOO!
Excuse me, pardon me.
The string, quick! Grab the string!
Hey, Miss Mouse, don't worry, I'm ok.
See? I'm alright.
That's not the reason I'm crying.
I lost Timmy's medicine.
Aw, don't cry. I hate to see a woman cry...
Hey! Was I great, or was I great? Did you see that cat out there?
All dripping, and... and wet... with water...
I'll... go back to Mr. Ages tommorow, and...
You weren't so bad yourself.
Hey, we make a pretty good team!
Oh, here, you dropped this back there.
Nobody messes with ol' Jeremy, boy.
Nobody!
That's it! Timmy's medicine!
Oh, thank you! Thank you so much!
Huh? It i... what? It is? I mean, it is.
Well, I saw it lying there, and I said uh...
My name is Jeremy.
I'm Mrs. Brisby.
Thanks again!
I have to go home now.
Uh, where's home?
In the garden patch, by the stone.
Do you like me?
Of course I like you!
Bye now.
No! I mean... I mean, um... I mean you don't think I'm clumsy or anything?
Oh... sorry. Excuse me, pardon me.
Oh. Well, if you're going to feather a nest you've got a lot to learn about how to treat a lady!
Right. When you're right, you're right.
And you're right.
None of the girls I meet want to get serious!
I doubt they'd survive.
Huh? Maybe it's my approach.
Say! You were a girl once!
You could teach me how to... you know, how to...
Behave yourself?
I'm not that bad!
I just need a few pointers to polish my style.
Jeremy, I have got to go home!
Well let me... Let me fly you home!
We can talk on the way!
Oh, no thank you. I'm afraid of heights.
OK, then we'll walk.
Bye now.
I think I got real potential
I mean, girls go for the athletic type, don't they?
Jeremy, you're stepping on my tail.
Excuse me, pardon me...
Maybe I should go look for Mom.
I don't think so, Martin.
Brisby! Briiiiiisby!
Oh! Auntie Shrew!
Oh Auntie!
Oh no...
She'll wake up Timothy!
She's not here.
Why is she always coming around here, poking her nose in where she's not wanted?
Martin!
Thank you child. I must speak with your mother.
Your Auntie is exhausted!
Why me?
That I alone should be responsible for the welfare of the entire field is monstrous!
Brisby!
Mother isn't here.
Auntie Shrew, Timmy's sick!
Cynthia dearest, don't pull me.
She's not here?
She left you children alone then?
I'm old enough.
Rats in the field up to heaven knows what sort of mischief...
Cynthia dear, don't fidgit!
You're so like your mother!
I ain't scared of nuthin!
She went to see Mr. Ages.
To Ages? That old flim-flam!
Whatever for?
Auntie Shrew, Timmy's sick!
Patience, my pet.
Why to Ages?
- Timmy's sick!
- Timothy is very ill.
Timmy ill? How dreadful!
I'm not afraid of the dark!
I'm not afraid of the farmer!
I can't hear!
I'm not even scared of Dragon.
I'm not even afraid of... of... of the Great Owl!
- Will you hush up?
- Aw, you hush up!
Martin!
Precocious monster!
Bossing bullfrog!
Spoiled brat!
Loudmouth!
That will be quite enough, thank you!
Cast not pearls before swine,
I always say... and that includes impudent piglets!
Good day!
Oh! You impertinent little...
Martin! Auntie Shrew, what's going on!?
Indeed!
Please... come back inside...
Not for a king's ransom!
I have just one thing to say.
That child is a brat!
Yes, I will speak to him.
I came here to inform you... that the frost is off the ground... and Moving Day is at hand.
Prepare to move your very very odd family.
Good day.
You never know what might be lurking about out here what with rats and...
Well, children. Now you've done it.
It was Martin.
The Shrew means well.
She only wants to help.
Gosh, I'm sorry, Mom.
Is Timmy gonna die?
No, sweetheart. He's just very sick.
What's the matter with him, Mother?
Mr. Ages called it... pneumonia.
Pneumonia?
When will he get better?
Soon... I hope.
Off to bed with you now.
Dear, a man came by today, from NIMH.
- NIMH?
- Yes, you know!
The National Institute of Mental Health.
He was asking if we had noticed... anything strange... about the rats on the farm.
Well, I said "No, nothing unusual".
Beth, I have to get up early.
Oh, it gave me goosebumps to hear him carry on that way!
Like the rats might have some horrible disease!
Night, Beth...
I told him you'd call him back.
What did I tell you? Moving!
- It can't be!
- It certainly can!
I don't suppose you've packed!
What about Timmy?
The chill in the air could kill him!
Well child, that tractor surely will.
For the last time, get your children out of here before it's too late!
Run! The plow is here, run!
It's Moving Day!
Run!
The plow is here!
Run!
Run! Get out!
Brisby!
Go get... Timothy!
Please! Take the children out of here!
Mommy, we can't leave Timmy!
Go with Auntie Shrew.
I've got to try to stop that thing!
Wait! You're out of your mind!
Brisby, come back!
Brisby! Hang on!
Hang on!
Brisby!
Come on! Come on!
Well of all the rotten luck... fuel line's cut.
He'll come back tomorrow...
I wish Jonathan were here.
Well, he's not.
Stop it!
What am I going to do?
We'll think of something.
Come on, let's get out of here.
The Great Owl would know what to do about this.
You must go see him.
Oh I... I couldn't do that.
Owls eat mice!
Well my child, show a little courage!
We're fighting for Timmy's life!
Jonathan, your wife, I fear
Is in desperate trouble.
A visit to the Great Owl may indeed be profitable.
Go to the Owl then, Mrs. Brisby.
Go there!
Nice evening huh?
I told you you'd love flying.
I don't know how
I let you talk me into this!
Aw, don't thank me, Mrs. Briz.
When we get to the Great Owl he'll know just what to do about everything!
Owls eat mice!
Ummmm... only after dark...
That must be the Owl's tree over there.
Hello?
Hello?
Anybody home?
Well, the place looks deserted.
I guess we'd better get outta here.
Step inside my house...
Come inside, or go away.
Timothy... remember Timothy.
Why have you come?
Please forgive me for disturbing you... but my son's life is in great danger.
The plow has come early this year and...
Move your family.
Yes... I would move, but Timothy has pneumonia.
He can't even get out of bed.
You must move it to a place where it will be safe from the plow.
Please... there must be another way.
There is no other way.
I must bid you good evening, Mrs...?
Mrs. Brisby.
Brisby? Mrs. Jonathan Brisby?
Why yes! He was my husband!
But... how do you know about him?
That is not important.
I will say this... his name is not unknown in these woods.
Please sir...
I'll do anything to save Timmy.
Anything.
There is a way.
Go to the rats.
But I don't know any rats!
In the rosebush.
Oh yes... near the farmhouse.
Go there.
Ask for Nicodemus.
Nicodemus?
But how can they help?
They must move your house to the lee of the stone.
No rat could move my house! It's...
They have ways!
I don't understand... but I will do as you say.
It is night. I must go.
Remember... the lee of the stone.
What... what did he say?
He said to go to the rats.
Rats. What rats?
The lee of the stone...
Mrs. Briz! Briz!
Oh, excuse me, pardon me.
Jeremy? What on earth?
I'm in disguise!
Jeremy, please, not now!
I'm trying to find the entrance, and these thorns are very dense.
Here, let me help you...
Will you be quiet?
They'll hear you!
I've got to find this Nicodemus before the farmer gets that tractor fixed!
I'll keep a lookout!
Will you...! You're going to get us both killed!
I don't see anybody coming.
If you really wanted to help me, you'd go away.
Why that's very brave of you, Mrs. Briz but I can't... I can't leave you here alone.
Why, if anything were to happen, think... think of the children!
That's it!
Huh? That's what?
Jeremy someone strong should be protecting my children.
In case that tractor starts up again.
Oh, in case the tra...
Hey! How 'bout me?
Oh, would you?
Yeah, sure! That'd be terrific practice!
Girls can't resist a guy who's good with kids, you know, domestic type.
Play games, help out, domestic!
Yes. Yes, domestic.
Now whatever you do don't tell them where I am.
My lips are sealed, Mrs. Briz.
Bye.
Good luck with the rats!
Where do you live?
By that big stone in the garden.
Just stay out of trouble?
Not to worry, Mrs. Briz.
I love kids and kids love me.
Kids love me and I love kids.
Dragon! You lazy kitty!
Go catch some of those rats out in the barn!
I've never seen a cat sleep so much.
Er... hello.
I'm... I'm Mrs. Brisby.
Umm... I was told to see Nicodemus.
Are you Nicodemus?
Please, I need help!
Who goes there?
Me!
Mrs... Brisby?
What are you doing here?
Oh! Oh thank goodness it's you!
How in thunder did you get in here?
The plow has come early to the field... you had better march straight back out the way you came!
I can't bring Timothy out.
The chill in the air will kill him!
That's another matter. That doesn't explain what you're doing here.
And that big rat chased me away.
But I must see Nicodemus!
The Owl told me to see Nicodemus!
Well, yes, perhaps you should...
The owl said?
Here now, what owl?
What are you talking about?
I went to see the Great Owl.
The Owl? You say you saw... the Owl?
Yes, and he said I should ask for Nicodemus.
Er, yes, I know Nicodemus.
He lives with the rats.
More specifically, he is the leader of the rats.
You know him?
No one has ever seen the Owl... and lived to tell about it!
Please... could you take me to see Nicodemus?
Well... ye-e-ess, yes.
But for your sake, I hope you're telling the truth!
Come on.
What about the large rat at the entrance?
I can't go back there. I can't.
Oh, that's just Brutus. Follow me.
Well? Come on!
Jonathan, your wife has come at last.
Perhaps now I can repay you for your kindness to me.
Yet Mrs. Brisby, who served the rats of NIMH far more than we her.
Jenner I fear may do her harm...
He is consumed by a lust for power.
Thus far, the amulet has remained safely hidden.
But if he finds it...
heaven help us.
Forgive me, I just noticed you're limping.
That's none of your affair.
Now, to what you are about to see and hear you must swear absolute secrecy.
- Yes, I unders...
- Swear it!
I promise.
If any of this ever got out we'd have humankind bulldozing their way down here to blow the place apart.
Is it always so dark?
We're down three feet.
It's the most beautiful sight I've ever seen!
Reveal thy name!
Justin, you featherhead!
Get your hands off me!
Ok, ok, just a joke!
I didn't mean any harm.
The meeting's already in progress.
What's this all about?
Who, may I ask?
Yes, yes, she can be trusted.
This is no stranger.
My dear, may I present Justin, the Captain of the Guard.
Justin, Mrs. Brisby.
Not... Mrs. Jonathan Brisby!
Yes, the same.
It is an honor and a privilege, milady.
If we could dispense with the formalities...?
How beautiful...
Ma'am?
Oh! Er... the lights!
They're quite lovely.
Yes, they are.
We've had electricity for four years now.
Five.
Jonathan often spoke of electricity.
But you see, our shame is that we're stealing it from Farmer Fitzgibbons.
Stealing?
All of that is going to change.
He means we're working on a Plan.
I mean, that we have a Plan.
And this stealing will stop.
Now...
Oh yes. Why did you send for me?
It's Jenner. He's at it again.
Hmmm. There blows an ill wind.
He's before the Council now.
This time he's attacking
Nicodemus openly.
And the Plan, no doubt.
Nothing will come of it. It'll pass.
Beware, boy, he's dangerous.
Jenner will be the undoing of the Rats of NIMH.
I'm sorry to come here at such a bad time.
I suppose...
No, sweet lady, you are welcome here.
We tend to take ourselves a bit too seriously.
The Plan is nothing but folly!
A doddering old fool's fantasy!
Nicodemus would have us destroy this colony only to lead us to starvation in some wilderness!
Ahem. Good ol' Jenner.
Wait. Listen.
Moving to Thorn Valley is a good plan!
Fie! We have everything we need right here!
You mean we steal everything we need.
Well come on, you suspicious old goat!
If we stay here, humans are bound to discover us.
They'd destroy us on the spot!
I agree!
He's right. We'll be killed.
Not if we got them first!
He means war!
We'd be outnumbered.
There are too many of them!
Hear me!
The Thorn Valley Plan is the aspiration of idiots and dreamers!
We...
We were just talking about you.
That's refreshing, Jenner.
Usually you're screaming about us.
Who is that?
You know the rules there are no visitors allowed here.
May I present Mrs. Jonathan Brisby.
Jonathan Brisby is dead!
She's not one of us.
What's the meaning of this?
Send her away.
Let's get back to business!
Wait, wait!
She has been to see the Great Owl!
He has told her that we could move the Brisby home to safety.
Her home was Jonathan's home.
We have urgent problems of our own.
Let the lower creatures fend for themselves!
Order, order!
Wait, my friend. I smell an opportunity.
What?
Manoeuvers of this nature are dangerous.
- Accidents could happen...
- Accidents?
Jenner?
- I'll explain later.
Mrs. Brisby! A thousand pardons, my dear!
Forgive the ill temper of my colleague.
It would be an honor to assist
Jonathan's widow in any way.
We are but your humble servants.
Th... thank-you.
I second the motion.
Hear hear!
Motion has been moved and seconded.
Those in favor make a show of hands.
He's up to something...
Take Mrs. Brisby to the library.
We'll approach Nicodemus when the meeting's over.
Motion carried.
Ok now, wait a minute this isn't what you think.
You don't understand what I'm doing here!
Think you can come snooping about looting and pilfering, just when everyone's away?
Well uh... Let me explain about...
Oh! What a lovely hat you're wearing!
Don't you sweettalk me!
I know you're in league with those awful rats!
Rats? Ummm... what rats?
Hoodlums, the lot of you!
Ummmm... why did you say rats?
You think the world owes you a living, right?
Right.
Wrong!
Wrong! Ohhhh..
Look, nice lady, you're making a mistake!
The sooner you delinquents learn that you must earn your own way...
Wait! Wait, can't we uh...
Can't we talk this over?
The sooner, the better.
You can't leave me like this!
There's a ca... ca...
There's a ca... He's a very big... and he might... and he might... mlfffp!
Good! Good riddance!
Teresa! Martin!
That's the least you deserve.
Auntie?
There you are!
Keep an eye on this hooligan.
Make sure he doesn't get away until I can fetch help.
And as for you, you black buzzard.
I wouldn't try anything!
I shall return!
Well, I guess we'd better untie him.
But Martin...
Hey, Mom helped a crow in the field the day before yesterday...
He's trying to talk!
He looks like a loony.
He even took her to see the... the Great Owl!
So?
This could be the same crow!
That's me all... Whew! I am the crow.
Untie me quick, I can't stand it!
What are you doing here?
Oh, it's a good question, but don't ask.
The legs... the legs... THE LEGS!
Aw, the poor turkey fell down.
I'm not a turkey! Your mother...
Where's our mother!
You big buzzard, where's our mother?
- What have you done with her?
- You'd better tell me or I'll tie you back up again!
The... the rosebush! To... to see the rats!
Did you take our mother to the rats?
Well I'm going to go look for her.
No, no, listen, hold it, waitaminute.
The rats, they're friendly!
Good! Tonight... Stay!
They're coming here to move your house where it's safe!
Understand?
Sta-a-ay...
The Owl said they're good and smart.
Get it?
You're right. He's a loony.
Oh no... no, don't...
You must...
No, don't do this!...
Now don't tire him out.
No.
Be brief.
Yes.
Say what you want... and leave.
I won't be a bother.
Justin bothers him enough with all his silly nonsense.
Here we are.
Thank you, Mr. Ages.
I don't know what Nicodemus sees in that boy...
I'll come back for you.
- Brief!
- Brief.
Come closer, my child.
Don't be frightened.
Sir... the Great Owl sent me to you.
Oh, did he?
He is a dear comrade...
Closer.
Ahhh, Mrs. Jonathan Brisby.
What an honor this is.
How... how is it that everyone knows Jonathan?
He was a great friend to the Rats of NIMH.
He himself came from NIMH.
Your majesty, my family is...
I know of your needs.
There is a book there. Read the words.
I can read, a little.
Jonathan taught me.
The children are better... than I am...
Read.
Jonathan... Brisby... made... possible... the rats escape... from the t... terrible cruelty of NIMH.
Jonathan?
He was ki..
Killed today... while drugging the farmer's cat, Dragon.
Oh, I... I never knew... just what happened.
Why did he never tell me about any of you?
Why?
To answer that, I must tell you about NIMH and our Plan.
Go!
Look there!
In the beginning, we were ordinary street rats.
Stealing our daily bread and living off the efforts of man's work.
We were captured, put in cages
and sent to a place called NIMH.
There were many animals there... in cages.
They were put through the most unspeakable tortures
to satisfy some scientific curiosity.
Often at night I would hear them crying out in anguish.
Twenty rats and eleven mice were given injections.
Our world began changing...
Then
one night.
I looked upon the words under the cage door...
and understood them.
We had become intelligent.
We could read.
The miracle was kept secret from the scientists.
And in the quiet of the night
we escaped through the ventilation system.
The mice were blown away
sucked down dark air-shafts to their deaths.
All except two...
Jonathan and Mr. Ages.
We were trapped by a locked door on the roof.
It was Jonathan who made possible the unlocking of the door.
I have a gift. Come.
Jonathan meant it for you.
It's so beautiful!
It sleeps.
Sleeps?
Yes.
When worn by one with a courageous heart the Stone glows red.
It becomes a blinding radiance.
Courage of the heart is very rare.
The Stone has a power when it's there.
Look! An inscription.
You can... unlock any door... if you only have the key.
Oh, thank you.
I will treasure it always.
Jonathan couldn't tell you about NIMH because the injections slowed the aging process.
You see, you would have grown old while he remained young.
Nicodemus.
The boats are ready and waiting.
We can leave any time.
Good.
My child, shall we journey to your home?
Sir?
Tonight we must move your house to the protected side of the stone.
The lee of the stone!
Yes.
I don't get it, Jenner.
With Nicodemus out of the way what's to stop us from taking over?
Jenner, you can't kill Nicodemus!
No taste for blood, eh?
They've taken the animal out of you.
What if we're discovered?
Ach, listen.
The Brisby house is a large cement block.
In the moving, what if it should fall?
- An accident?
- Of course!
Cut the lines, and the weight of it will crush his bones!
It's risky..
Once rid of Nicodemus, the Plan will die.
We can stay here as long as we like!
What... what about Justin?
Leave him to me...
Sometimes, when we have a large project that takes us into the open.
Mr. Ages makes up a sleeping powder to give to Dragon.
How do you get him to take it?
Someone must go into the farmhouse kitchen and put it in his dish.
The only way into the kitchen is through a tiny hole in the floor.
Ages tried it yesterday.
That's how he broke...
Broke his leg.
Right.
That was close.
- What's up there?
- The mill. It's falling apart.
Hope it stays up there at least until we've done with the Plan.
Plan... what is the Plan?
To live without stealing, of course.
It's wrong to take electricity from the farmer.
My child, we can no longer live as rats.
We know too much.
We're almost there.
Um... your Majesty
I should go prepare the children, for tonight.
We shall wait here until dark...
Um... About Dragon, maybe...
Oh nothing. Goodbye!
I volunteer! For Dragon.
Oh no, Mrs. Brisby!
Nicodemus, this is no job for her!
Please.
As you wish.
All right.
I'll meet you at the west side of the farmhouse at dusk.
Thank you.
Oh I must be crazy.
Goodbye!
I must be crazy...
Excuse me... pardon me.
Jeremy?
Shhh! I'm being followed.
Followed?
Shhh-hhh! There's a crazy lady with a hat!
She's got big teeth!
She tied me up! And then I... oh!
Ooooo! A sparkly!
What?
You're wearing a sparkly!
Can I hold? Oh, please, can I?
Jeremy, listen...
I need lots and lots of string.
Stuh... ring...
To move the block!
Move... the block...
Hey! I got string! I've been saving 'em!
You do?
Oh sure, red ones, blue ones
- green, yellow.
- Pay attention!
Go get all the string you can.
Ok.
But that'll take all day!
Good! Get going!
I just thought I'd mention in passing...
I've always wanted a sparkly of my very own.
- Will you get going?
- Sure!
Uh... Excuse me. Pardon me.
Bye!
It won't be long now.
She's washing the dishes.
Here's the powder.
- Nervous?
- Very.
Don't be.
You'll be ok.
I hope I haven't upset your plans.
Nonsense!
What makes you say that?
I thought I might have caused an argument.
Oh you mean Jenner.
No problem.
Justin?
I sincerly hope you make it to Thorn Valley.
We will.
Shh! Listen.
Mrs. Fitzgibbons is filling Dragon's bowl.
Get ready.
Oh my...
Better leave that cape.
Could get caught on something.
Here's the powder.
I don't think I can do this!
Yes you can!
Now take a deep breath.
Concentrate on the bowl.
Don't look at the door!
Steady...
Ok Dragon, I'm coming.
Steady...
There we go.
Now! Now!
Coming, coming!
Get back!
Mom! Don't let the cat in yet
I've caught a mouse!
A mouse?
Can I keep it? Can I?
No, Billy. Put it outside.
Damn!
Aw Mom, please?
I can keep it in Porgy's old cage.
Oh... all right.
Come on, Dragon.
I'll have to come back for you later.
Rats, rats?
They'll be here any minute... to move our house over there by the stone!
Wrong!
Actually move it!
Not while I'm keeping watch!
Auntie Shrew? I'm not afraid.
Afraid, child?
I have no fear of those great hulking beasts.
And should one of those hairy barbarians come through that door...
Oh! The rats!
I'm coming, I'm coming, hold your horses.
Hello?
Who?
NIMH.
Oh! Oh yeah, NIMH!
Yes, yes, I know, you called about the rats...
Well, I don't know nothing about any special behavior but the traps sure don't work...
In the morning?
Suits me fine...
Oh no, no, you can bulldoze that rosebush right outta there
I want those rats exterminated!
Uh, well, there's no... charge...?
Good. Ok, well, I'll see you tomorrow then...
Uh-huh... bye-bye.
NIMH... They're coming here?
I must warn Justin!
Teresa!
Martin!
Auntie's afraid!
Pull on the end-haul.
Careful. Careful!
Easy does it...
Nicodemus is cooperating beautifully...
Jenner... he's standing in just the right spot!
Jenner, I... I can't do it!
When that block reaches midway, you cut the line.
I...
Don't get any ideas, my friend.
You're in this up to your neck!
Come on mates!
Put your backs into it!
Ready with the knife...
Ready...
Cut now!
- I... I...
- Now! Cut it!
Don't!
Ok, help.
We've got to hurry!
That's it.
Come on, come on!
We're coming!
Ok, I see him!
Nicodemus... oh no!
No!
Friends... we cannot move the Brisby home.
But we... we just can't leave it here in the mud.
The equipment is a shambles.
Justin!
One day we shall journey to
Thorn Valley just as Nicodemus wanted... but not now.
Justin!
Mrs... Brisby?
Come. Let us return to the rosebush.
Where we belong.
Oh, Mr. Ages!
What happened?
The children!
They... they're fine.
Nicodemus is... dead.
Oh... oh, no.
You're in great danger.
NIMH is coming!
Come come, let's return to the rosebush...
NIMH is coming!
- NIMH?
- In the morning!
- NIMH!
- Yes.
You will all die unless you leave the farm tonight.
Lies!
Please! You must believe me!
What if it's true?
- We'll all be killed!
- Don't panic!
Don't listen! She's hysterical!
Get out now...
You get out! I've had enough!
Jenner!
Justin! Justin!
Jenner, stop this!
The Stone...
Jenner...
Get out of my way!
I want that Stone!
Jenner!
Justin, Justin!
My sword!
It was you...
You did it!
You killed Nicodemus.
That was no accident!
Yes. I killed him!
He wanted to destroy everything!
I've learned this much.
Take what you can, when you can!
Then you've learned nothing!
Friends... tonight we journey to Thorn Valley.
We will leave no tracks.
No evidence that the Rats of NIMH ever existed...
Come.
Hello, is anybody up there?
- Martin?
- Momma!
Mother, are we almost moved?
Soon now...
It's sinking... it's sinking...
Justin, the block! It's sinking!
What?
Come on!
Oh no, it's sinking!
There must be a... a cave in below!
Here, tie these lines together.
I'll get a line around the stone.
Now!
Brutus, quick, get some rope.
Tie off those blocklines.
Hurry it up, come on!
Move it!
Mother! Mother!
What's all that black stuff?
Come on, Teresa, get up on the table!
Cynthia...!
What about Timmy?
Get us out of here!
Mother!
Another line! Get some rope!
Justin!
Justin!
Hang on! Don't let go!
Grab onto my foot!
I can't breathe!
Oh no! Come on!
- It's sinking farther!
- We're losing it!
Courage of the heart is very rare... the Stone has a power when it's there.
The stone...
Momma, I'm tired of bed.
I want to get up!
Well, you're not getting up.
Miss Briz! Oh Briz!
Where are ya?
Over here!
Here it is!
I brought the whole mess!
There's plenty more where this came from too.
I got connections!
Hey! Your house is moved!
Oh no! What am I gonna do with all this string?
You'll think of something.
Ah, what's the use?
What's a guy like me going to do with a love nest anyway?
- Excuse me, pardon me.
- Excuse me, pardon me.
Look Mommy! Another turkey!
Stay right there.
Miss Briz! Miss Briz!
Lemme have the sparkly!
I gotta have the sparkly!
Miss B, I gotta have it!
Girls can't resist a sparkly, oh please! Pleease!
I gave it to Justin.
Justin? Who the heck is Justin?
The leader of the rats.
The leader of the rats!? How could you do this to me?
What'll I say? Mrs. B, what'll I do?
Well... just be, ummm... Be athletic!
Ah! That's right! Athletic!
I'll just be a little...
Mother, did the rats really go to Thorn Valley?
Yes, they did.
- Will we ever see them?
- Perhaps.
- Today?
- No... when you're older.
Brisby!
Oh! Auntie Shrew!
Oh Auntie!
Oh no!
Sonja.
You are suffering, Sonja...
but vengeance shall be yours.
Vengeance on Queen Gedren...
who wanted you for herself.
Your disgust was clear.
And so it was that Gedren
ordered your family murdered...
your body violated by her soldiers.
But in your quest
for justice and vengeance...
you will need great strength...
for your sword arm must have no equal.
I give you that strength.
Varna, where is the Lord of Hyrkania?
He has not come, Highness.
He should be here for the destruction of the talisman.
But we cannot delay.
We will proceed without him.
O God of the high Gods... behold the talisman with which you created the world and all things.
O God of Gods... it has become too powerful for us... and we must destroy it before it destroys the world.
Forgive us now as we send it out of the light... from which it draws its power... into eternal darkness.
Forgive us.
Come on.
So this can make worlds... or shatter them by storm and earthquake.
Have it lifted out.
Lift it out!
Touch it.
So it is true. Only women may touch it.
The cover.
Take it out.
Great queen, what shall we do with the prisoners?
- No!
- No!
Come.
Horses.
The talisman's stolen.
Must destroy the talisman.
We must find my sister. Take me.
I know where she is. Please.
Magnificent.
You have nothing more to learn, Sonja.
You are the master of the master.
Never have l seen your equal.
You must learn to like men a little better.
They are not all evil.
We must judge by our own experience,
Grand Master.
I know.
But in life, all is not swordplay.
Hatred of men in a lovely young woman... it could be your downfall.
I don't hate all men, Grand Master.
That would have been music to my ears
30 years ago.
Come.
A great swordsman must have a great sword.
Choose.
A gift from the Grand Master.
Sonja.
What is it, Red Sonja?
I'm looking for Red Sonja.
- I am Sonja.
- Your sister's dying.
I'll take you to her.
Varna.
Thank God.
I've lived long enough.
The talisman's stolen.
All the priests massacred.
- We fought...
- Rest, Varna. Later we can talk.
There's no time. Listen.
The talisman has terrible power... which grows in the light.
In 13 days it could destroy the world... by storm and earthquake.
You must destroy the talisman, Sonja.
Send it into darkness. Swear that you will.
I swear.
Who took it?
I don't know.
There was a woman with a gold mask.
Soldiers.
Where did they take it? North? South?
She's dead.
And the living have work to do.
Her work, my work, is no concern of yours.
- Who are you, anyway?
- My name is Kalidor.
I befriended your sister, remember?
I'm a friend of yours, too.
I thank you for what you did for my sister.
You will be rewarded.
I'm no mercenary. Nobody pays me.
If l think somebody owes me something, l take it.
Someone is using the talisman.
- What place is that?
- Hablok. It's a great city.
Where are you going?
Hablok.
Wait. I'll come with you.
Why should you? It's no business of yours.
And neither am I.
You may be wrong on both counts.
I know you're a brave girl, but danger is my trade.
Then l'll learn it by myself.
Don't make me angry, Kalidor.
I don't need any man's help.
Don't shake it, fool. Hold it steady!
Can you do nothing right?
Still, you great idiot.
I'm trying, Your Highness.
Clumsy oaf. Stupid, dumb, useless, selfish beast!
Quickly, come. Come to me.
Don't give me orders, slave.
I'll have you hung by the heels.
Anyway, it's too slippery.
Do you want me to fall in that boiling mud? You numskull.
I'll try to swing it around. Now.
- Hold still, boy.
- Boy?
Steady, Your Majesty. Steady.
Jump off. Jump.
What about me?
Get back here and stop playing the fool.
I hear and obey, master of the world.
I'm coming.
Lucky for you that this person came along.
Reward her, and tell her who l am.
His Royal Highness, the Prince Tarn,
Great Lord of Hablok... keeper of the spotless throne... great elephant who fertilizes the world with his... l've told you not to say that.
Do it again, and l'll have you impaled.
Well, reward her, fool.
From the look of your kingdom, Prince, you need this more than l do.
Did she address me?
What happened?
Queen Gedren attacked us is what happened.
Gedren? Queen Gedren?
That's right.
She knocked down half the city with her new weapon and demanded our surrender.
My army ran away.
Do they want to live forever?
I refused to surrender.
So she knocked down the other half.
Falkon, since everyone is dead or run away... you shall escort me to the mountains tomorrow.
I shall raise a new army... and crush this upstart Gedren underfoot.
Where can l find her, this Queen Gedren?
In Burkubane, the land of eternal night.
How do l get there?
There's a long scenic way, and there's the short way through Brytag's toll road.
I'll take Brytag's toll road.
Which way is that?
Straight north from here.
You can't miss it.
But it's worth a try.
Ask the woman if she wishes to join my army.
We'll probably need a cook.
Your Highness is too kind, but l travel alone.
Dismiss the woman, Falkon.
I shall dine in an hour.
May l give you a word of advice?
Put him over your knee and beat some manners into him.
You wouldn't happen to have a tablecloth, would you?
Brytag, come down and open the gate.
Not so fast, redhead.
I'm up here where l can get a better look at you.
I have no time to waste, Brytag.
I have plenty. Come up, l say.
- Come here, wench.
- Why should I?
Because l am Brytag. This is my land.
All that pass through pay me tribute.
- How much, Brytag?
- Who mentioned money?
Tribute, l said.
The tender kind all women pay to Brytag.
Suppose l don't.
Suppose, instead, l open up that great fat belly of yours.
You hear that?
She's going to open up my great...
Woman, l have fought 177 men.
Only one survives, and he has got no legs.
You dare to mock at Brytag?
That takes no daring.
But when l've killed you, will your warriors let me go unharmed?
When you've killed me?
When this wench has killed me, you will let her go unharmed, won't you?
Aye.
See?
So, wench.
I'm gonna feed your eyes to the birds, red hair.
I don't need eyes to find you.
I can smell you at a hundred paces.
I will tell the future in your entrails, red woman.
I know my future. You have none.
Hold on, Sonja.
Sonja, come on.
Look out!
This way. Follow me!
- Get away. Go!
- What about you?
I can hold them. Go!
Hurry! Stop them!
Release me, ruffian!
Release me, l say!
- Tell us where it is.
- I'll have your head for this!
Don't be shy.
The gold, boy. Where's the gold?
There is no gold, ruffian.
I tell you, l have no gold!
You have fine raiment, boy, almost as resplendent as mine.
And you expect me to believe you're penniless?
I'll have you know, villain, l am Prince Tarn of Hablok.
My subjects will see to your punishment for this.
And a grievous punishment it will be, impertinent oaf!
Your subjects?
My kingdom is greater than yours.
And l have but four.
Pull him!
- Are you all right, your sovereign Majesty?
- Yes, clumsy oaf.
Why did you leave him?
We needed food. I went hunting.
You could have taken him with you.
Tell her, Falkon, that l don't care for hunting.
He doesn't care for hunting.
Treasure to the vaults, prisoners to the dungeons.
Take the talisman back to the Chamber of Lights.
Very well, my queen.
Perhaps fewer candles... would be advisable, Your Majesty.
Why?
The stronger the light, the greater the power of the talisman grows.
I want more light here, not less.
But it is dangerously powerful already, great queen.
- Look what it did to Hablok.
- Yes. Very satisfying.
But l want its full power when we march against Toktyl, Ikol.
Its full power.
- It will be beyond our control, Majesty.
- Majesty!
Enemies are approaching the outer empire.
It's the Prince of Hablok, Your Majesty... with his army.
Insects.
That girl.
So she escaped the fire. How fortunate.
Ikol, l want her alive without so much as a scratch on her skin.
Shall l send out a small ambush party?
No.
We'll wait till they get a little closer.
Burkubane, the land of perpetual night.
Falkon, proclaim my arrival... and the defiance of Queen Gedren.
Sound your trumpet.
Keep quiet... at least till we find a way across.
Princes do not sneak in on their enemies like thieves.
You don't know much about princes, do you?
You wait here with the horses.
I want to test this bridge first.
Or whatever it is.
It looks safe enough.
We'll lead the horses across.
Now hear me, Gedren!
It is I, Prince Tarn of Hablok... to revenge myself on the tyrant of Burkubane.
Be quiet, you arrogant, ungrateful pup.
How dare you, woman?
I'll show you how l dare.
This should have been done long ago.
No. If you must hit someone, then hit me.
You're not worth the effort, boy.
Boy?
Yes, boy. You'll never be anything else... till you learn gratitude and self-sacrifice, like Falkon.
He's a real man.
She didn't mean it, my prince.
She doesn't know your fine qualities.
Take that, ruffian.
Take that, you ruffian.
Practicing, Highness?
I thought princes did everything so well, they wouldn't need to.
I was disarmed by those ruffians the other day.
I noticed. So? It needn't be fatal.
I am disarmed. Kill me. Come on.
Come on!
You're meant to be using your sword. Remember?
Simple, isn't it?
But it's not in the rule book.
You see, fencing and fighting are two different things.
You need to learn them both.
Will you teach me to fence and to fight?
If you please?
Spoken like a prince.
You were disarmed because you hold the hilt too tight.
Grip gently. See?
Gently. I see. Like this?
Your Highness learns fast.
I think we'll continue your fencing lessons another time.
We've an early start.
You are very beautiful.
When l am king of Hablok, l shall have you at my court.
You will? My, the honor.
I may even make you my queen.
But l'm still young.
We shall have to see.
They will reach the Ithian Cavern tomorrow.
We must force them to take shelter there.
The killing machine will do the rest.
Yes. They'll make fine fish food.
But not the girl.
I want that beauty here with me.
See to it that she is spared.
I'll do my best, my queen.
The machine is difficult to control.
One cannot guarantee that something will not go wrong.
If it does, you will be its next victim.
The talisman, Ikol. We need a storm.
A little one.
We should be out in the storm.
Why? This is shelter, isn't it?
I haven't got time to shelter.
I've four days left to find the talisman.
Besides, something drove us in here... every bit of the way.
I noticed it, but l'm not complaining.
Where's Tarn?
He promised not to wander.
Dry off, l'll go find him.
Look at this.
It must be the biggest in the world.
Could be fake.
There's a lot of bad stuff around.
This pearl can rebuild Hablok... fill its treasury, buy me an army.
Dig it out!
Your Highness, it may belong to somebody.
It does, and he wants it now!
Yeah.
Use your dagger, fool!
What are you doing?
Falkon, Highness, look at the water!
Come on. Put your back into it.
It won't budge.
Maybe it wasn't meant to come out.
The water is rising.
You must get out of here.
- This way! Make for the stairs!
- Come, my prince!
- Get out of the water!
- Yes.
Climb up here, my prince.
Tarn!
I'm coming, my prince!
Let go!
Where is she?
I can't kill it! It's a machine!
Sonja, we have to blind it!
It's our only chance!
Falkon, get out! It can't see!
There. Keep it covered.
Why have you been following me?
To see that you reach the talisman safely.
Why?
I have to be sure that the talisman is destroyed.
Centuries ago, the high lords of Arcadia... had entrusted the talisman to the priestesses... because only women may touch it.
But to guard it, or to destroy it if need be... is still the duty of the High Lord.
You? The High Lord?
I was coming to the temple to see the talisman destroyed... when l found your sister dying... and learnt that the talisman had been stolen.
So she guided me to you.
Why didn't you tell me who you were?
You didn't seem to want a man's help.
But you needed it, so that's why l followed you.
I had to be sure you reached the talisman.
I see.
I misunderstood.
I thought you had another reason.
I did.
No. I'm under a vow.
No man may have me unless he has beaten me in a fair fight.
So the only man that can have you is one who has tried to kill you.
That's logic.
If you yield only to a conqueror, then prepare to be conquered.
Don't be a fool. I don't want to kill you.
Try it.
Come on.
Keep it down over there.
We're trying to sleep.
Are you all right?
Yes, Prince. We were just practicing.
Then let me down!
Thank you.
Why does she fight so hard?
She doesn't want to win.
Gedren's army.
Another kingdom enslaved.
The talisman! We must find a way in.
We'll have to climb.
Three of us should go in.
Who'll stand guard this doorway, the post of danger?
- Falkon?
- Me? Here?
I don't know what's coming out that door.
No, l am going up.
Coward!
I'll take my chances in there.
And l have to go in.
I'll stay.
Take care, Your Highness.
Thank you.
Tomorrow, l start my diet.
Majesty, the talisman is almost beyond control.
We must bury it in the dark before it is too late!
It'll be buried when l have no further use for it, and that time is not yet.
But it will kill us all!
O God, Majesty, what do you want?
Our vaults are brimming with gold.
Great states live in terror of us!
- What more is there?
- The world, Ikol!
Today we took another piece of the city of Toktyl.
But l have wider claims and the talisman will enforce them!
Madness. There will be no world.
There will be no world.
We must find the talisman.
Only l can touch it, remember.
You take that way, l'll go the other way.
Falkon, you take the center.
How's the food around here?
Who are you?
- Look for the talisman.
- Yeah. Right.
- Ikol, Gedren's black spider.
- You.
Yes. Prince Tarn of Hablok:
The city you blasted with your filthy sorcery.
So the royal brat hasn't learnt his lesson.
Out of my way, child.
So that you can desert, like the thief you are?
With my gold?
Hablok's gold?
Now that was unmannerly of Your Highness... and rude little boys need correction... if they're going to grow up into... l'm afraid Your Highness' growth is going to be stunted permanently.
Now, yield, Black Spider.
Where's Queen Gedren?
She's gone. I'm so glad that you've come.
Please, will you protect me?
I'm so frightened.
Gedren! Where are you?
So the Prince of Hablok honors us with his presence unwisely.
How many are with you?
Tell me! How many are with you?
- How many?
- Enough, Gedren!
Get back, or Hablok will need an heir to the throne.
And your own throne, Gedren.
Unless the talisman goes into the dark, your whole kingdom will...
Prince, get Kalidor and Falkon.
There's a way behind the throne.
The talisman, Gedren. Quickly!
You are a fool.
We could have ruled the world together.
Now l shall rule alone, and you will die for what you did to me.
What l did?
You slaughtered my parents like cattle.
My brother, my sister!
Vermin! What were their lives compared to this?
You are mad!
The talisman will destroy you.
Up here, Sonja.
Up here.
Kalidor, Falkon, this way! Hurry!
Down this hallway!
Sonja. Over here.
Falkon, help.
Prince Tarn, come back.
I am here, Gedren. Death to all tyrants.
Sonja, help me!
I'm trapped!
Sonja! Behind you!
I can't get through.
Falkon, pull her through. I'll hold the gate.
Follow me. This is the way out.
How do you know, Highness?
Because this is the way l came in, you clown.
Here's the way through.
Go. Quickly!
The door doesn't move.
How does it open?
I know. Leave it to me.
No! Come back, Prince!
He's done it.
We can't leave him.
Wait here, my prince. Don't go away.
Save yourselves! Run for it!
You, too, Falkon, you great, clumsy oaf!
Run! Run for it!
I'm not leaving here without you, my prince.
Give me your hand. Reach. I'll get you out.
Hablok is over there.
When it's rebuilt, you must come to visit us.
I'm sure to need a queen someday.
You'll find one.
Whoever she is, Prince, choose carefully.
I make it a rule never to take a woman unless she can beat me in a fair fight.
That's a challenge l might think about someday.
What about right now?
Why not?
Come along, Falkon.
Come on.
English
Gideon.
Gideon!
It's Nicholas.
Yes, sir?
Tonight I give the Christmas angels their assignments.
Well, I thought you forgot about me.
Forgot about you? Oh, no, Gideon.
I have a very difficult case for you this year.
Her name is Ginnie Grainger.
She never even says "Merry Christmas. "
Yeah, I know. Where will I find her?
In a town to the north, called Medford.
You'll find her there tomorrow morning, in a shopping mall.
Medford, north, in a shopping mall.
Mommy!
Bye, Santa.
Mom, why can't I go see Santa Claus?
Mom, why?
Because I say so, that's why.
Come on, Ginnie, let her. It's only $4.50.
I have to work over an hour to make four and a half dollars.
You get a job, you can take her to see Santa Claus.
Are you gonna start up with that again?
Please, Mom. Please!
Abbie, you are going to get a smack in a minute, and I mean it.
We came here to get socks and stuff, and that's it.
It's OK, honey. You don't want to see that Santa Claus anyway.
He's not the real Santa Claus, is he, Cal?
No, the real Santa Claus is up at the North Pole.
This guy's just like, you know, Santa Claus's helper.
If I don't even see
Santa Claus's helper, how does Santa Claus know what I want for Christmas?
Santa Claus! Abbie, for Pete's sake, you're nearly seven years old, so...
Mom!
- Ginnie.
It's about time you found out that the only real Santa Claus is the one at the North Pole.
I'm six. I already knew that.
- Can we have an ice cream, Daddy?
I want a Cabbage Patch Kid, and a toy oven that really bakes.
Just put it all in the letter to Santa.- OK, Dad.
I want a Swatch watch, too.
Forget it. You're not getting all those things. We can't afford a big Christmas.
We can't, but Santa Claus can.
He has a zillion million dollars.
Hey, old Santa had a pretty tough year, too.
He might not even be able to get to some of the poor kids.
Like Molly Monaghan?
- Like Molly Monaghan.
Don't get jelly on your jacket.
- Abbie got jelly on her jacket.
I did not, jelly face.
One of these days, Abbie. To the moon!
Hey, Dave.
- Hi, Jack.
Who's that, Dad?
- That's Dave Gilchrist.
He used to work with me over at Continental. Continental Radio.
That's where your old dad got canned from by that dork, Frank Crump.
A long, long time ago.
Hey, not that long ago. July.
- June.
And Continental's making us move out.
Right, Dad?
Yep. Yep, it's a company house.
It's their house.
Oh, look, Cal.
Our snowman fell over again.
We gotta build it again.
Where are you going?
Down the basement. Work on those bikes for the neighbour kids.
Jack, we're moving in only ten days.
We gotta start getting some of the packing done.
Come on, Ginnie, just give me half an hour, 45 minutes.
I gotta get 'em done by Christmas Eve.
So I'm supposed to do all the packing by myself on my one morning off from work?
Just give me a little while down there and then I'll give you a hand.
Hey!
Hey, Eddie.
Can you believe that weather we're having? Huh?
Do you think we're gonna get another blizzard?
I hope not.
Still working on the bikes?
- Working on the bikes?
Well, I don't know.
Huh?
- Oh, brother! Go on down there.
Thanks a lot, honey.
You won't be sorry.
I'm already sorry.
It's time to finish the great
Jack Grainger special, huh?
No, gotta finish this one for Molly Monaghan first.
But if I can sneak a few more hours' work on it, oughta be ready for a road test.
High speed, very low energy input.
Jack, this could be some kind of breakthrough.
You could make a mint on a bike like this.- I could?
I thought about owning my own shop.
- Really?
Yeah, sell my own special designs.
I worked out the figures, though.
It'd cost me 5,000 bucks just to open the door. That's 5,000 more than I got.
Which reminds me.
I collected 18 more bucks for the town tree fund from the guys at work.
Good. Puts us over 200.
You know, everybody thinks we're nuts for doing this.
Why? It wouldn't be Christmas in Medford without the town tree lit up, right?
Hit it over, come on!
- How about passing the puck sometime?
Out of my way, Ralphie!
It's stopped snowing!
What are you getting for Christmas, Molly?
I don't know. Nothing, I guess.
- But what would you really like to get?
A bike. I'd sure like to get a bike.
Three days till Christmas.
- Does your mom like Christmas?
Yep.
- My mom don't. I wish she did.
Your momma doesn't like Christmas?
- Who are you, mister?
A friend. Just a friend.
Hey, boys, be careful.
There's little kids here.
Eat snow, mister!
I told you that'd happen.
- Let's get out of here!
That's amazing! The window broke.
- The window broke!
Hey, Mom, we've got company.
Mr Grump.
- What?
Hey, how you doing, Ginnie?
Frank Crump from Continental.
I just dropped by to show these folks around the premises.
Well, Mr Crump...
This is the Noonans, Mrs Grainger.
They just wanted to have a quick look-see around, you know.
Mr Crump,
I haven't even made the beds, and I...
Hey, hell, who cares if the beds aren't made?
Abbie, Cal. For Pete's sake, you're tracking snow all over the carpet!
Now go outside right this minute.
- We'll just start downstairs, OK?
The basement's right down here.
Hi, Jack. Frank Crump.
Just showing the new tenants around.
You got a full basement...
All this junk out of here, you'd make a swell rec room for your kids.
This colour in the kitchen, Mr Crump, this awful yellow.
Is there something you can do about that?
We could repaint it for you, Louise.
Any colour you want.
It wasn't this yellow when you moved in, was it, Ginnie?
No. I painted it myself.
I like yellow.
Well, I guess we'd better be pushing along. OK.
You're gonna be outta here by the first, right, Ginnie?
Yes, that's right.
- Right, OK.
Mr Grump?
- That's "Crump. " Yes, dear?
My daddy says you're a dork.
Think it ov...
Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop! In the name of love
Will somebody please get the phone?
Hold up, Abbie. I gotta go.
- I gotta go more than you gotta go.
Wrong number. This is not my day.
Mom, Abbie's in the bathroom and I gotta go.
Abbie? Oh, come on,
I'm taking a shower, Abbie.
Now, I've got to get to work.
Do you have to lock the door?
- Got to, Mom.
Miss Badducci says to tell you Merry Christmas.
Well, tell Miss Badducci thank you.
Why don't you ever say
"Merry Christmas," Mom?
Well, nobody ever really means it when they say it, anyway.
It's free, Mom.
- My turn.
Oh, no, I'm gonna...
No, Cal...
See you later, Mom.
Hi, Molly. Be my guest.
Please, in my next life, let me have two bathrooms.
Mrs Grainger!
Cal?
- What?
What's a dork?
- Dork? Well, it's, uh...
You know, like a sorta...
Well, you're too young to know, meatball.
Oh. Thought so.
Oh, no.
You're in a lot of trouble, meatball.
Attention, Glen's Market shoppers.
Good afternoon. Here are your
Saturday afternoon five-star specials.
Nabisco Shreddies in the large family box, only $1.69.
You save a dollar off our regular price.
And Glen's own boneless beef stew... stew beef, sale priced at only $2.29 a pound.
Excellent value. Have a nice day and thank you for shopping Glen's.
Herbie Conklin, manager.
- Herbert.
Herbert.
Keep things moving here.
Hey, you already rung up them Dorito chips already.
Oh, OK. You're right.
I'll take it off your tote.
See what she tried to pull on me?
See that? Next time
I'm going to the A&P!
Please be my guest.
Next time, go to the A&P.
All right.
That's $16.64, minus the potato chips.
Got that five cents, Frankie? Come on.
OK, fine now.
Thank you.
Ginnie, let's step on it here.
Your line's backing up.
Hey, Herbie, why don't you get off her back?
She's behind because she made your announcement for you.
Yeah, well...
OK, that's $26.83, Mrs Monaghan.
Cash or check?
I've got these food things.
But there's only $25 worth.
I don't know what to say.
I could loan you, maybe.
Oh, that's OK. I don't need this.
OK, it's...
That's $2.29. You're down to $24.52.
- Good. I'm OK, then.
Here it comes, Dad.
- OK, kids. Send it up.
Here it comes, Jack.
It's the prettiest angel ever.
- It's the biggest angel ever!
Bye, angel!
What did you get Mom for Christmas?
- A ring. A beautiful amethyst ring.
It used to belong to my Grandma Rebecca.
Whoo!
But don't tell anybody, OK?
Cos it's a secret.
OK, Dad.
Dad, is there such a thing as an angel?
Of course there is.
- Mommy says there isn't.
Well, I believe that there is.
I believe that whenever anybody who's really good dies, they go up to heaven and become an angel.
A guardian angel or a Christmas angel.
All kinds of angels.
Are you ready?
Give me your legs.
And the angels are everywhere.
They're all around us, and they're watching us, to make sure that we're A-OK.
But you can't see 'em, right, Dad?
- That's right.
Because they are invisible.
Invisible.
Exactly.
Night, Dad.
- Good night, honey.
Invisible.
Did the kids give any trouble about going to bed?
No, they went right up.
They're sleeping.
Look what I got 'em for Christmas.
I ran over to Toys R Us on my dinner break.
I got Cal an Etch A Sketch.
You know how much he likes art.
And I got Abbie this tea set. I think she'll really like that, don't you?
Yeah, she will.
So...
So I guess we can go get the rest of their stuff on Monday.
Yeah, we'll go get 'em some crayons, little things like that.
But that's the main thing.
Cal?
- What?
If Santa Claus brings all the toys, how come Mom bought me that tea set?
I don't know. I think Santa Claus only brings some of the toys, and your mom and dad have to buy the rest.
Oh.
- That's why they got toy stores.
Anyway, I think Santa Claus isn't coming to us this year, cos we're too poor.
Not because we're poor.
- Then why?
Because I didn't write no letter to Santa Claus.
Yeah, well, a lot of presents doesn't make it any better of a Christmas.
Well, when you're a little kid it does, hon.
We've still got $5,000 in the bank.
We might as well take out a few hundred and just buy a bunch of stuff.
A few hundred? Jack, that money's all we've got between us and the poorhouse.
You want to throw it away on a bunch...
No, no, no, no, no.
Not throw it away.
Yeah, throw it away on junk from Taiwan that's gonna be broke in two days.
We don't have to buy junk.
We can buy good stuff.
That's not the point. The point is, what happens if one of us gets sick?
What do we do for money then?
"That's all Cal and me want. "
"Please write back and tell me if you are really real. "
"Your friend, Abbie Grainger. "
It's all wrote, Elizabeth.
I'm sorry I was so cranky tonight.
It's OK.
It's just this moving thing, you know, with Christmas on top of it.
Well, you'd be better off if you believed in
Santa Claus like Abbie.
Like you, you mean.
You believe in Santa Claus, don't you?
- Sure.
Or at least, you know, a nice spirit that's around at
Christmastime, that's all.
I've noticed.
Mostly round department stores.
Give us a kiss.
Oh, give me a land where the bright diamond sand
Flows leisurely downstream
Where the graceful white swan
Goes gliding along
Like a maid
In a heavenly dream
Can you keep a secret?
Yes.
Well, I'm an angel.
A Christmas angel.
Oh, no, you're not, cos my dad told me you can't see angels. They're invisible.
Well, they're invisible sometimes, but sometimes they have to show up.
So what's your name, then?
- Gideon.
Gideon, was you a good person that died?
Good person?
Well, I was a cowhand, out west.
And one Christmas a long, long time ago,
I was riding along the Snake River, and I heard this little kid yelling for somebody.
And so I jumped into the river to save him.
Well, I saved him all right, but I got myself drowned, cos I didn't know how to swim.
And after that, they made me a Christmas angel.
What do Christmas angels do?
Well, my job is to...
Every Christmas I have to help one person that's feeling down to get into the Christmas spirit.
One person?
- Yeah.
Could it be my mom? Could you make my mom like Christmas better, Gideon?
Yeah, I think so, if you'll help me.
- OK.
Abbie?
I knew it.
Take this letter that you wrote to Santa Claus, and give it to your mom and let her mail it for you.
Why?
That'll help her get into the Christmas spirit, and then that can be our Christmas present to her.
Now, you'd better go on inside because your momma's going to be worried.
And remember, don't tell anybody that you talked to an angel, OK?
Abbie!
Abbie!
Abbie, you were nearly run over by that car.
I know, Mom, but the angel Gideon made it. I mean, a man made it.
Abbie, what are you talking about?
Come inside the house right now.
Yes, Mom. Here, you can mail a letter to Santa Claus.
This letter, Abbie...
Coming out in the night, nearly getting hit by a car.
Abbie, you're in big trouble. I mean it.
But it was an angel, and I talked to him.
You are never supposed to talk to strangers.
Is that the kind of motel you lived in when you was little, Mom?
Not really.
- No, your mom's was bigger.
It was the Ramada Inn, and her dad was the manager.
Is that where you met Mom, Dad?
At the motel?
No. The motels came later.
Jack!
No, I met your mom on a blind date.
Ginnie Hanks, prettiest girl I ever saw.
And you know something?
The minute I saw her, I knew she was the girl I was gonna marry.
You did not!
- Did so.
And she's still the prettiest girl in the whole world, isn't she, kids?
No, she's just Mom.
Just Mom.
We finally got here.
Hi, Great-Granddad.
Hey, Granddad, good to see you.
Merry Christmas.
Great-Granddad, is there really, really, really a Santa Claus?
Well, of course there's a Santa Claus, Abbie.
Why, you're a Grainger, honey.
Our family, we've always been strong believers in Santa Claus, and the Christmas spirit and angels and stuff.
We're dreamers, I guess you'd say.
Yeah, you're great dreamers, all you Graingers.
That's what's so wonderful about you,
I guess.
In other words, we're nuts, huh?
Over there, Cal. That's a boy!
- Is there a ghost up here?
Nope, just cobwebs and old stuff.
A rocking horse! A rocking horse!
I know those Christmas tree lights are up here somewheres.
How about this box right here?
Here they are. I knew they was up here.
Oh, my goodness.
I clean forgot about these.
Lookee here, kids.
What is it?
It's the North Pole, where Santa Claus lives.
Ooh, it snows.
That's pretty, Great-Granddad.
Do you want it, Abbie?
- Sure.
Thanks, Great-Granddad.
And here's the Christmas book my mother used to read to me when I was little.
Do you want it, Cal?
- Thanks, Great-Granddad.
Now you both got a present from me.
Won't have to give you nothing for Christmas.
But maybe I will anyway.
Cal?
- What?
If we was at Great-Granddad's house, would Santa Claus fit down that chimney?
Sure. Santa Claus can fit down any chimney, cos he's magic.
Magic?
- Yep. He's watching you all the time.
He can see you wherever you are.
- The bathroom, too?
No, every place except the bathroom.
- Thank goodness.
Mom, is that Santa's house?
Yes.
- Does he have any kids?
No, he just has a wife, Mrs Santa Claus.
Oh. Mom, if Mrs Santa Claus had kids, would she be crabby to them?
All moms are crabby sometimes, but that doesn't mean they don't love their kids.
You go to sleep, all right? Good night.
Good night, Mom. Mom, did you mail my letter to Santa Claus?
No, Abbie, I didn't. Not yet.
Aw, gee, Mom. Now I won't get anything.
Oh, Abbie, stop it.
Now, you're going to get plenty of presents.
Now just go to sleep.
Good night.
Mom's never going to like Christmas,
Elizabeth.
Gideon!
- Shh.
Your mom still hasn't found the Christmas spirit, has she?
Nope. She didn't mail my letter yet, cos she's never gonna like Christmas.
She did once, a long time ago.
But then she lost the spirit.
Something in her broke.
The glass ball! It broke.
Fixed.
- It's fixed.
I can fix broken pieces of glass.
But only your mom can fix what's broke in her life. What's been lost.
Can't we help her?
- Well, we can help her remember.
How, Gideon? What are we gonna do?
Well, we're going to give her a Christmas present that only angels and children can give.
And I want you to listen real careful now.
No matter what happens between now and tomorrow night,
I don't want you to be afraid.
I'm not afraid.
- That's good.
Now, you will need to find me later on.
Do you know where to find me?
- No, Gideon. Where?
Where the angel is at the top.
The tree.
- The tree?
The tree. At the tree.
At the tree.
This letter is to Santa Claus.
What are you doing?
Nothing. Just going through these figures again that I worked up for the bike shop.
Are you still thinking about that?
Yeah, well, I had this idea.
Knock it off by a couple of thousand, and then maybe I could float a small business loan.
A loan? With what for collateral?
Forget it. You've got to get a job, a regular job that brings in a salary every week.
I know. I know I need a job.
This bike shop idea is the dumbest thing
I've come up with yet.
Where are you going?
Jack!
I'm sorry, honey. I'm sorry.
There's just no way you can start any bicycle shop.
It just seems like nothing's going right for you and me. Just nothing.
And now Christmas.
I don't know one thing we've got to be so joyful jolly about.
Things'll be better next year.
- Maybe.
Still, you know, ever since my dad died last year, I've been thinking.
Why did he even live?
What did he live for? A motel manager.
And me, what am I living for?
The supermarket?
People live for...
Well, I suppose, for nights like this.
Watching Christmas lights...
Being able to hear the rain on the roof.
Being able to see just one star.
Stars...
You know, when I was in high school, we had this piano teacher, Miss Lehmann, and she used to have us kids over to her house to listen to records.
She liked those Broadway shows, you know.
And she used to have this song called "Lost In The Stars. "
I've never heard that one.
You would like it.
It reminds me of you.
Sometimes I think maybe God's gone away, forgetting the promises he made.
And we're lost out here in the stars
Little stars, big stars
Shining in the night
And we're lost out here in the stars
You know something, honey?
If you came on this little walk here to cheer me up, you're doing a lousy job.
Hey, Jack, I'm just...
I'm gonna take another turn around the block.
Howdy.
Late Christmas cards, or maybe something for the North Pole?
I'm a little old for the North Pole, thank you.
Well, you don't sound like you've got much Christmas spirit.
I don't know you, do I?
- No.
No, I didn't think... I didn't think so.
No, I don't have much Christmas spirit.
But you should, you know. That's sad.
I should, huh? Why?
- Why?
You've got to find out, Ginnie.
I want you to find out.
How'd you know my name?
I put a tuna nibble casserole for you and the kids' supper in the fridge.
I'm gonna be working all day, all night till ten.
Honest, honey, couldn't you call in?
- Jack, we've been through this.
If I don't work a double today,
Herbie says that's it, I'm fired.
We'll go to Granddad's first thing in the morning.
But then how will Santa Claus know where to bring all our stuff tonight?
Abbie, I'm getting a little sick of hearing all this talk from you about Santa Claus.
If he's coming, he'll know where to find us.
He'll know, honey, and he's coming.
- Right, he's coming.
Jack, you just remember what I said to you about the bank account.
So you're going to miss the town tree lighting, too.
I've seen Christmas trees before.
And now me and Abbie won't be able to decorate no tree tonight.
Hush, Cal. You'll be able to decorate one tomorrow, right?
Ask Daddy. I gotta go.
Yeah, Eddie's gonna bring that generator over.
Thank you, sport.
It wasn't as heavy as I remembered.
Hi, Betty.
- Good morning.
Can you believe those jerks at the city council?
Won't even throw in five cents' worth of free electricity.
OK, we're all set. Meet me at the tree at 5.30 and we'll hook it up.
Yeah, I hope this is worth it, and you folks aren't...
Hey, shh. Ginnie doesn't know that part.
Bye, honey.
Gin? I have eight dollars exactly, so can you make sure I don't go over, OK?
OK, I'll get the window.
Oklahoma... No papers.
How many miles did you say you got on this heap?
155,000's more like it.
I can't give you anything for this wreck.
Hey, look, do me a favour, will you?
Give me a break.
I gotta get my hands on some money today. For this kid.
It's Christmas.
- Hey, I'm sorry.
I'll give it to you!
A hundred bucks, the car's yours.
50 bucks?
- I'm sorry.
Or I got this camp stove.
Ah, sure you're sorry!
OK, that's that.
I'm gonna drop you off at the bus station for a couple of hours, Frankie.
There's something I'm gonna do.
OK, I gotta go in the bank for a minute, kids.
But what are you going to do in the bank?
Never mind about that.
I'll just be a few minutes.
You guys stay right here and don't touch anything, OK?
OK.
- OK, Dad.
Abbie, Dad said to stay in the car.
Where are you going?
To see Mom.
Hi, Mom!
Abbie...
- Hey, Mom, guess what.
Dad bought us a little Christmas tree to decorate tonight. It's on the car.
Where is your dad?
- He went in the bank.
In the bank?
Oh, no, he doesn't!
Ginnie! Ginnie!
- Come on, you're coming with me.
Just where do you think you're going?
Herbie, I just have to go to the bank for two seconds. You could take my register.
Me? I am the manager here, and you're not going anywhere.
We're in the middle of the Christmas rush here.
If one more person says "Christmas" to me, I'm gonna throw something at 'em!
Now, I'm going to the bank, Herbie.
Well, that's it. You're fired, Ginnie!
Go jump in a lake, Herbie.
Thank you, Mrs McCormick.
- Merry Christmas, Eleanor.
Put all the money you've got there in the bag and don't say a word, or you're blown away.
Readouts.
You know you're not supposed to go in Glen's when I'm working.
I've told you that before.
Your dad, honestly!
Now I've gone and gotten fired.
Abbie, get in the car and don't get out again.
I mean it. Cal, keep her in there.
Is there a problem?
- Yes, sir.
Gimme that.
Keep that gun where it is, old man.
OK, now. We're leaving, me and her.
Anybody try anything, she's dead.
Hey, listen. No one's gonna stop you from going. Just let the girl go.
Leave me alone. Leave me alone, pal.
- Listen, it's Christmas Eve...
Jack?
Jack, you're gonna be OK, honey.
You're gonna be OK.
He's killed him.
He's driving off in Ginnie's car.
What?
My kids. My kids are in that car!
Hey, mister, this is my dad's car.
He took them. He took my kids!
He took my kids!
What are your names, then?
- I'm Cal and she's Abbie.
Well, I'm Harry.
Don't worry, I ain't gonna hurt you.
I've never hurt nobody.
Oh, help! He's down there.
Ginnie?
The police just called.
They found the children, standing by a roadside.
They're fine.
They must have been dropped off by the man before he went in the water, the police said.
We're home, Mom.
- The car crashed into the river, Mom.
But an angel saved us.
Right out of the river.
It was like we was flying.
Cal and Abbie?
Yes, Mom?
- Yes, Mom?
Sometimes bad things happen.
Real bad things.
And sometimes good things happen.
Right, Mom?
Right. But this is about a bad thing that happened to your dad.
What bad thing, Mom?
You know this morning when your dad went to the bank?
That man that took you away...
- Harry?
Harry, yeah.
He shot your dad, and your dad got killed.
You mean Dad's in the hospital?
No. No, Cal, you see...
- When's Dad coming home, Mom?
Well, that's the thing.
He is not coming home. Ever.
He's not coming back to us.
But he's gotta come back, Mom.
- For Christmas.
You have to understand this, you have to.
Your dad's not coming back.
Your dad died.
Dad never died before.
Cal?
We'll be all right.
We gotta make it, Cal, so Dad's not dead any more, so Mom's not crying.
We can't, Abbie.
- We gotta.
I know.
Maybe we can't, but Gideon can.
He can do anything.
He made this glass ball break, and then he made it so it didn't break again.
No, he didn't. Nobody can do that.
He did so, and I'm going to him.
Are you crazy?
Where do you think you're going?
To find Gideon.
- You don't know where he is.
I do, too, cos he told me.
I'm going to him. He's at the tree.
Mom, Abbie just ran away.
- What?
She said she was going to find
Gideon the angel at the tree.
Gideon?
Gideon?
I'm not afraid.
Abbie!
The glass ball?
The glass ball was one thing, but bringing your dad back is something else.
I think I know who we can talk to, though.
Who, Gideon?
Santa Claus.
- Santa Claus?
Do you know Santa Claus?
The real Santa Claus?
Then we gotta go to the North Pole,
Gideon, to see Santa Claus, so he can make my dad not dead.
Come on.
You didn't find her?
She came here. I know she came here.
Come on, Ginnie, I'll take you home.
She's probably already home by now.
See that little door up there?
That's where you have to go.
Now, you have to talk to him yourself.
And I'll wait for you here, to take you home.
I've really got to go by myself, Gideon?
Yes, child?
- Does Mr Santa Claus live here?
Of course he does. Come in.
What it is, Santa Claus... is my mom and Cal and me want my dad back, so he's not dead any more.
I'm sorry, little one, but there are some things not even Santa Claus can do.
You wouldn't have to bring me or Cal anything else. Just our dad back.
You could give the stuff you was going to give us to Molly Monaghan.
Molly Monaghan?
Oh, yes.
Please, Santa Claus, please.
I would, Abbie.
I really would if I could, but I can't.
I am sorry.
But there is someone who could.
There is? Who?
Your mother.
- My mom?
Yes.
She can make my dad not dead?
Yes, Abbie, yes.
But how could she?
I fixed your sweater, Nicholas.
Oh... Oh, my sweater. Thank you.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Abbie, I have something
I want you to give to your mother.
Is this your workshop?
- Yes, this is my workshop, Abbie.
My brother's never going to believe this.
Watch out for the bicycle, child.
My brother is never going to believe this.
Hello, how are you doing, Sidney?
- Merry Christmas.
Hello.
Bonjour!
Did you see that man?
That was Mr Perkins.
He used to be the janitor in our school before he...
Died? Most people think it's elves, but it's just nice, ordinary people, young and old, that work here.
Joyeux Noël, François.
Hello.
- Merry Christmas, Eli.
Merry Christmas, all.
Abbie, this is my mail room.
All of the letters children all over the world write to me come here.
Now, let me see. Oh, yes. What was your mother's name when she was little?
Ginnie.
I mean her last name.
- Oh. Hanks.
O'Hanks?
Oh... Hanks!
Hanks.
Hanks... Hanks...
My brother's never going to believe this.- Uh-oh.
Anyone! Chaps!
Would you please push me a bit closer?
In!
Whoa, whoa!
Hanks!
Now, let me see.
Ah, I thought so.
Now, here it is, Abbie.
Now, this is what I want you to give to your mother.
Santa Claus, how come you don't look like the Santa Claus in the mall?
Because the Santa Claus in the mall isn't me.
Santa Claus, how can one sleigh carry all the toys for all the kids, everyplace?
Because it's a magic sleigh. Very magic.
Do you believe in magic, Abbie?
Yes.
- Good.
Your lunch, Nicholas.
- Oh, yes!
Have a nice trip.
- Yes.
Take care of Abbie.
Make sure that she gets home, and I'll see you in the morning.
- I'll see you in the morning.
Goodbye, Abbie.
Bye, Santa Claus.
You wait here, Abbie, and I'll go and fetch Gideon to take you home.
Yes, Mrs Santa Claus.
Santa Claus has gone.
Good night, Gideon.
- Good night, Abbie.
Hi, Cal.
- Abbie, where you been?
To the North Pole.
- You have not. Mom's mad at you.
She was looking for you everywhere.
I saw Santa Claus, but he can't make it so Dad isn't dead any more, but...
You did not see Santa Claus!
I did so. Give me back my glass ball.
Who needs it?
I'm gonna tell Mom you're back.
And you're gonna get it, Abbie.
You're gonna get it good.
Gonna get it!
Mom, Abbie came back. She's upstairs.
Abbie...
I told you, Mom.
I told you she was back.
You go on back downstairs.
I want to talk to Abbie for a minute.
Oh, Mom, do I have to?
Yeah, you have to. Go on.
Yes, Mom.
Come on, let's go to your room.
Abbie, where have you been?
I've been worried sick.
I've been to the North Pole, Mom, to see Santa Claus.
Don't tell me stories like that.
No, Mom, really.
Gideon took me there. He can fly.
You gonna spank me, Mom?
No, I'm not, but you shouldn't tell fibs.
Yes, Mom. But it's true.
There is an angel.
You know there's an angel, or Cal and I would be drowned in the river.
Maybe there is an angel.
There is a Santa Claus, too. But he can't make it so Dad's not dead no more.
Aw, honey, nobody can.
No, you can. He said you can.
But then he didn't tell me how.
I'm tired, Mom, real tired.
It took such a long time, going all the way to the North Pole and then coming back home again.
I know.
Tell you what.
Close your eyes, go to sleep.
When you wake up in the morning, it'll be Christmas.
Yes, Mom.
Santa gave me something to give you.
It's a letter.
It's in my pocket.
OK, Abbie.
"December 21 st, 1959."
"Dear Santa Claus,
"I want roller skates and a Hula-Hoop and a raggedy doll and a tea set and a Mister Potato Head. "
"Your friend, Ginnie Hanks. "
Oh, my!
Good night, Ginnie. Merry Christmas.
Good night, Gideon.
Oh, Jack!
You're not dead.
Hey, honey, of course I'm not dead.
No... No, of course you're not dead.
Of course not.
It's just that it is so good to see you.
So good to see me?
Well, I saw you a minute ago, didn't I?
You sang that little song, remember?
Yeah. Yeah, just a minute ago, yeah.
I love you so much.
I love you, too.
You're not going to work, Mom?
No, I'm not going to work.
I don't care if Herbie fires me.
It's Christmas Eve and we're going to be together.
We're going to have a wonderful Christmas, you'll see.
I'll give it to you.
A hundred bucks, the car's yours.
Forget it. It's not worth anything to me.
50 bucks?
I'm sorry.- So what'll you give me for a camp stove?
50 dollars.
Some kind of joke?
No. No, I just really need a camp stove.
There it is.
Thanks a lot.
You don't know what this means to me.
Maybe I do.
Thanks again, lady.
Merry Christmas.
I don't care if you fire me, Herbie.
It's Christmas, and I'm going to spend
Christmas Eve with my kids and Jack.
And I mean it.
- Is that so?
Well, you know what I have to say about that.
No.
- Go, and don't come back.
Not until Thursday morning.
But you be on that register nine o'clock sharp. Merry Christmas.
Herbie! Thanks.
Molly Monaghan wanted a bike.
Yeah, and now she's getting it.
Hurry up. Come on, get in.
Close the door.
Merry Christmas!
A bike! A bike!
Look at it. Isn't it beautiful?
- A bike!
Oh, it's so nice.
Maybe it needs oil.
- Maybe.
How faithful are thy branches!
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree
How faithful are thy branches
Green are thy boughs in summertime
And through the winter's frosty rime
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree
How faithful are thy branches
For the Jack Grainger bicycle shop.
Santa Claus?
- Santa Claus.
Santa Claus is real?
No way! He can't be.
But he is. And don't ever forget,
I told you so, Cal.
Something's missing, something's missing.
Oh! Yes, of course. Lights.
Merry Christmas, Ginnie.
Merry Christmas.

Hi, honey, this is your mother.
Listen, I know you're very busy... with the new job but please try and call us.
Did you get the birthday sweater we sent?
We'll be home all weekend. Bye.
Howard, Jim here.
We still set for racquet ball on Saturday?
Give me a shout, buddy. Bye-bye.
Hi, it's Wendy. I had this really intense dream last night, Howie.
I was running my fingers through your feathers, and all of a sudden...
Well, you better come over tonight... and I'll show you what really happened next.
Ciao for now, Howie.
Hey, Ricky's back with you again for lots more Dance Frenzy excitement!
Here's couple number three, our lovely Latin dance team... from Wedford Falls. Charles is a Machinist First Class in the Navy... and his darling wife, Madge, is a blackjack dealer.
Just a super jock dance.
Charles and Madge!
- Come on, let's hear for them, folks.
- What's the matter, George?
Jock itch again? I've got just the thing.
Here. Why not take a shot of New Shorts Blaster?
It's guaranteed to wipe out feather fungus...
- in even the most active crotches.
- Shorts Blaster.
In addition, you've won a new car!
- But that's not all.
- Nice...
Oh, Fred, I love you so much.
- It hurts like hell...
- He's dead.
$79.95? Forget it!
$49.99? No way!
I'm crazy and my prices are insane!
Who did they interview this month?
My little airbrushed beauty.
What?
Oh, no, it's a quake!
I can't get up!
What's going on here?
Casey, did you hear something?
I'm such a lucky girl.
I'm in love.
The Cosmos.
Countless worlds upon worlds.
Worlds without end.
In these galaxies every possible reality exits.
And what is reality on any one world is mere fantasy on all others.
Here, all is real and all is illusion.
What is, what was and what will be start here with the words...
"in the beginning there was...
Howard the Duck!"
Boy...!
I'm a dead duck.
Hey, come on!
No!
Hey, Bender, go on in, Frankenweed.
We finally found you a date.
What is this?
Hey! That costume don't fool me.
No kids allowed.
- Come on, Kid.
- Wait a minute, that's my date!
I said out of the way!
No, wait!
You little creep! Get away from my cart, you filthy degenerate!
- Christ, it touched me!
- What the hell is it?
- I wasn't trying anything! Honest!
- Step on him!
Up and away!
Are you ready for an incredible story?
- Waste it, man, waste it!
- No!
Talk about a rotten day...
Just saw your show!
- Great, thanks.
- Beverly, we love your music.
- Bye now.
- Could I have your autograph on my shirt?
Me too. On my shorts?
- Real charming. Just go away, okay?
- We're talking to you, big rock star!
- Don't try anything!
- Don't go snot nose on us.
- We're your biggest fans.
- Let me go!
Help somebody, help! Help!
Come here, snot nose!
That's it. No more Mr. Nice Duck!
Let the female creature go!
Every duck's got his limit, and you scum have pushed me over the line.
Jimmy, do you like see what I see?
- A talking duck?
- Yeah. That's it.
I've been doing too much toot.
Shoot! Fly away!
No one laughs at a master of Quack-Foo!
Jimmy, you okay?
Get off me!
You, creep, get out of here!
You're breaking my fingers!
Now, you and baby face are gonna beat it, right, Mr. Zitz?
Before I get really mad!
Come on! Let's get out of here!
This is obviously no place for an intelligent, sensitive duck.
This is unreal. I mean, it can't be.
- Thanks.
- You're not really a... a duck?
You know, this is beginning to seriously undermine my self-esteem.
I'm sorry, I guess I should thank you for chasing those guys off.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, sure. Terrific.
I just have one giant question.
Where am I?
Oh, well, The lights up there are Ninth Street and the bus stops at the corner of Powell.
No, no, no, no.
I'm asking, what is this place?
- Cleveland?
- Cleveland? Uh-huh...
That's a perfect weird name for this planet.
Planet? No, no, that's a city.
The planet's... You don't know the planet?
Oh, well, the planet's called Earth,
I think.
And I'm obviously in some sort of terrible nightmare.
Oh, yeah? Your nightmare or mine?
Good point.
So, I guess I better be going.
Thanks again.
Bye.
Bye...
Listen... You got someplace to go?
If I had someplace to go,
I certainly wouldn't be in Cleveland.
Come on.
Nice place. Do you pay to live here?
It's cheap.
The manager of my band found it for me.
I suggest you find a new manager.
I'd love to, but we got this damn contract with this sleazoid.
He won't even give us the money he owes us.
Come on in.
It's sort of a disaster area.
We've been working on some new songs, you know.
See, the band's called Cherry Bomb, and... we've been playing these grungy mong-holes waiting for our big break.
You don't have any idea what I'm talking about, do you Mister...
- Hello.
- Duck?
- It's Howard, thank you.
- Right, Howard.
Hi, I'm Beverly.
Listen, would you like something to eat or drink?
Milk? I could put it in a bowl.
Doll, I don't drink out of bowls.
You got a beer?
Beer? Right, beer, right.
God, I can't believe this.
- I'll put you in a bowl.
- What?
No... Give me a break.
- What's this?
- It's a purse.
- I got it at a swap meet.
- Cute.
- Big one...
- I'm sorry, I'm so nervous.
It's just that I've never been around a...
I mean, I've never even had any pets or anything, you know?
They seem like such a hassle.
You know, feeding them...
- cleaning up their little poo-poos.
- I'll try to be careful.
No, I didn't mean that you...
Look, why don't you just sit down...
- Okay, why not?
- And make yourself at home.
- Make myself at home? I wish.
- Listen.
Oh, no, not again!
Howard, it's okay. Are you all right?
- The chair started shaking.
- It was just a big truck going by.
A truck? I knew that.
What I don't know is what the hell I'm doing here!
It's like a bad trip.
I mean, talk about an identity crisis.
Yeah, what an awful thing to happen.
Howard, I was just kinda wondering... does everybody in your planet look like you?
- Obviously, why?
- No reason, just wondered.
So, what do you do back home?
You got a job? You go to school?
- I went to med school for a while.
- You went to med school?
Yeah, my parents wanted me to be a doctor.
Plastic surgeon, making big bucks, doing big jobs, tail tucks.
- What happened?
- I dropped out.
And I decided to educate myself in the real world, on the streets.
So, I wrote songs at night and did construction work by day.
Wow. That sounds great.
You know, I write songs too.
- What kind of...
- Listen, it doesn't matter.
It was all a pipe dream.
I got so tired of everyone saying:
"Grow up, Howard". I guess I finally did.
Last month I got what they call a "promising job".
- Yeah? Doing what?
- Advertising copywriter.
Only two things touch my feathers, this "Oil of Night Fowl" and him.
I wrote that.
Geez, Howard, it sort of sounds like you sold out.
Maybe.
But sometimes I still get this feeling... there's some kind of special destiny waiting for me.
Howard, that's it.
Maybe that's why you're here.
- What?
- I mean, I believe... that there are no accidents in the universe.
Maybe you're here for some greater purpose.
- Some cosmic cause.
- Are you nuts?
I got no intention of being stranded here.
I gotta get back.
- How, is another matter.
- Yeah, right. We gotta get some help.
But, Howard...
Oh, geez...
Howard...!
What am I gonna do with you... ducky?
- This is humiliating.
- I just don't want people...
- freaking out all over the place.
- What about me?
I'm gonna have to see a psychiatrist...
- every day for the rest of my life.
- Relax, we're almost there.
- Oh, goody.
- Phil's a scientist. He can help.
- Howard, this isn't working.
- Tell me about it.
Can I give you a hand with that?
- No, we're doing...
- What's in the bag?
I'm doing fine, thank you very much.
Let me out of here.
- Excuse me. Can I help with that?
- No!
Yes!
Why are we stopping?
- Hi.
- Hi, Beverly.
We had an appointment.
We got here as fast as we could.
God... Listen, everybody, this is it!
I've just seen it!
It's in there! It's a... it's...
It's... It's nothing!
It's nothing, never mind.
Carry on, Dr. Chapin.
This is amazing. Man's oldest fantasy.
Across a sea of stars! Look up in the sky!
It's a bird! It's a plane!
- No, it's a duck!
- Phil, you gotta help us!
- What are we gonna do?
- Nice ducky.
Me Phil, you Howard. We be friends.
Me Phil, you Howard. We be friends.
Undoubtedly on of Earth's greatest minds here.
Hey, Phil, don't talk to him like that.
He's just as smart as you are.
- Now I'm really depressed.
- Highly intelligent, perhaps even...
Wait, that's it. We're about to see... if subject has any abilities we don't have on Earth, any...
- What?
- ...shall we say, super powers?
Howard!
Can you bend this?
- What are you, crazy?
- Howard... can you burn a hole through this with some kind of eye laser?
Can I bite your nose off with my super bill?
Howard, quit holding out.
I want you to concentrate...
- and read my mind.
- Right. You're thinking:
"They know I'm a phony.
They know I'm a yo-yo."
Tell me if I'm warm on any of these, Phil.
I want you to look into the future and tell me what you see.
- I see myself walking out that door!
- Yeah, me too.
- No, no, no, wait! You can't leave.
- Yeah, why not?
Because there are papers to be written, there's research to be done... and there's symposiums to give, lecture tours.
Howard, we are on our way to the Science Hall of Fame.
Look out, Darwin! Look out, Einstein!
Hello, Nobel Prize!
We're not here to make you famous, Blumburtt.
Beverly, listen,
I never bad-mouthed others... in the scientific fraternity, but you bring in an alien in a bag to most guys... and Whamo! They are talking.
Let's cut him into little pieces and see what color his organs are.
I just wanna know: A: What I'm doing here?
And B: How I'm gonna get back?
Piece of cake.
A: I'm just the guy to help...
And that's because B,
I've already got a theory.
- What theory?
- Well, this is, of course... the evolutionary ladder showing how man progressed...
- from monkey, to me, for instance.
- You consider that progress?
Geez... You're all hairless apes?
That's really disgusting.
Now, I want you both to imagine somewhere in the universe... is Howard's world.
Picture it in your mind.
A world almost exactly like ours... except that the progenitor of the dominant species...
- was not a monkey but a duck!
- Some theory...
Every school duck knows this stuff!
And as duck climbed up the evolutionary ladder... he said adios to his wings.
His mental capacity increases.
He begins to develop. Beverly?
- Shopping malls?
- No, tribes.
Cro-Magnon Duck, who ultimately evolves into Howard.
Hey, Blumburtt? Blumburtt?
- Come on!
- What the hell are you doing?
- What?
- Don't move! Don't breathe!
Did you finish cleaning up the specimen lab?
Almost finished.
Well, get down to the
Marine Lift Exhibit with a mop.
Some kid upchucked all over the fern fossils.
Right. Good as done, Dr. Chapin.
So, Philsey, you are a scientist or a janitor?
I'm a lab assistant.
- That's terrific! Just perfect.
- Yep, I'm out of here.
Look, it's just a temporary job until I finish school and get my own museum.
- Yeah, stuffed you'd make a great exhibit.
- Howard! Howard, wait!
- Typical hairless ape.
- Howard, look, come on.
Don't flutter off in a huff!
Beverly, listen...
I've got some important matters to clean up here, but I'll call you tonight.
I'll figure out a way to help Howard, I swear.
- Just don't show him to anybody else!
- Yeah, they look hungry.
- Get them a banana.
- Hide him! Take him to a movie!
- I didn't know where else to go for help.
- Inside, Blumburtt.
- Coming! Coming!
- Howard, why are you so pissed off?
Why? Listen, if you got blasted millions of miles through space... ended up on another planet... and were given an I.Q. test by a janitor, you'd be pissed off too!
Look, maybe you are trapped in a world you never made... but I got problems of my own.
My whole career is falling apart.
Your career? What about my life?
- I'm stranded here, ship wrecked!
- Look at this wonderful exhibit.
You see what I mean?
I'm a freak. An outcast.
- It's so life-like and realistic.
- Bug off.
- Excuse me?
- I said, "beat it".
Mutants. You, too.
- Leave me alone!
- What?
I don't need any more of your sympathy, your charity!
Okay. Okay, fine.
I mean, I just found something...
I meet somebody in a pretty weird predicament and I was trying to help.
But if that's the way you want it, then so long, ducky!
- Don't shed any tears over me, toots!
- You can wallow in your own self-pity!
Right! Well, who needs you?
- I don't need anybody!
- Yeah, right.
Yeah...
Damn it! I can't sit here on my tail feathers feeling sorry for myself.
I've got to think about practical matters:
Food, shelter... a job.
Now you do know why you were sent to me?
My continuing streak of bad luck?
You've been sent to me because
I'm famous for finding jobs... for little slackers like you.
That's right.
They send me all the psycho cases.
All the misfits.
All the phonies and the fakers... who think that by traipsing in here looking outlandish... they're not gonna be able to find work!
It's my fault I gotta shoplift at the little tyke section of goodwill?
I'm not talking about your clothes,
I'm talking about your face.
Hey...
You think that by looking controversial... you're never gonna find a job and just go on collecting unemployment... and living happy on the public dough.
Well, dude, you've got another think coming!
Because Cora Mae always places her interviewee.
I'm gonna find your ass a job.
That'll wipe that snarl right off your face, little whatever you is.
In fact, I think I got just the position for you!
I got a feeling you're gonna take to this job like a duck to water.
Towels, lotion?
Antibiotics?
It must be mating season.
Creepy little dude.
Hey! Shorty!
It's Howard, thank you, and I'm taking a break.
Pardon me, Your Aloneness... but we seem to have a plugged up airjet in number five.
- And?
- And...?
And since you are supposed to be the water expert I asked for... you are going to fix it!
Oh, no...
No, no, no, wait, wait.
I got a better idea! Wait, wait!
- I can't swim!
- Whoops, kid, guess I slipped.
Don't mind me.
I leave that creepy little dude in here to clean this place up...
How am I supposed to run a class...
Guess I slipped.
Just came by to tell you:
I quit!
Excuse me. Getting off. My stop.
Hi, there. How are you? Good to see you.
Yeah, same to you!
Urban jungle! Geez!
- What is that?
- That's a duck...
- What is that thing?
- That's a duck, man!
Forecasting our week of fair weather for you duck hunters... and for our lucky field reporter,
Steve Cannelli.
Well, Bob, it's time to dust off those decoys and practice that squawking... because duck hunting season has officially opened.
- Duck hunting?
- The Live Wild Commission... has actually doubled the limit of ducks that can be shot.
- Shot?
- Reaction of the local hunters... has been enthusiastic.
This duck has come to America with Duck-A-Roni.
No!
But if every hunter could blast
15 of those **** in the sky...
Hey, buddy, what's the rush?
This way is too depressing.
Okay... Give me a beat!
One, two, three, four!
Honey, I love you! I love you! Come on!
I'm right here. Beverly,
I'm yours after the show. Alright.
- Here's the money for the girls.
- I'll make sure they get it.
- Yeah, I'll bet. When?
- When?
When Bodacious Beverly stops holding on to me.
I'm gonna invite her up to my place tonight for a little career manipulation.
I guess you must be the girls' manager.
And if you are...
I don't like the way you're talking about Beverly.
And I want the girls' money!
- Ritchie? Would you... What is that?
- Oh, look, Ginger...
I warned you when you got into rock management... you'd be dealing with entertainment types.
You know, different strokes and all that?
Hey, hey, different life styles is one thing, different life forms is another.
I'm not in a real good mood tonight, Ginger.
I want the girls' money.
Now, is this gonna be easy...
- or is this gonna be trouble?
- Hey, Ritchie... tell it to go away.
I'm not up all my barnyard languages.
Okay, duck, out! You're gone!
You're history!
You little wise pecker! Arrivederci, duck!
- Mallard in the side pocket.
- Adios, quack man.
Very nicely done.
Hey, what's going on out there now?
- Alright, now it's my turn!
- Hey, come on, duck! Take your best shot!
- You got it!
- Ritchie!
Duck-kabob!
No!
No earring in your other ear?
I'll just make the hole myself.
No, please, man, no. Man, please! Don't!
- The money!
- Sure. Sure, here!
You take the money!
Take it! It's yours! Take it!
And, you're no longer their manager!
Listen, okay.
Everybody in here is a witness.
I'm letting the girls out of their contract, okay?
Tell your goons to stay back!
I'm warning you!
- Stay back, Ritchie!
- I bite your face...
- you're a dead man, Ginger!
- What are you talking about?
Space rabies!
- Ritchie, is that a real disease?
- I don't know, Ging.
I heard something about that on the news.
That's right, space rabies!
Yeah, one bite... and it's agonizing death in 15 seconds.
Bite, bite, bite!
We're all music lovers, huh? God...
What a dive.
- Those guys are a bunch of fools.
- Obviously the wrong crowd.
I'm running out of sticks to throw at people! Sucks!
- Now who?
- Look, tell him to go away.
Down here, doll.
- Is Beverly in?
- Wow!
Geez, you must be K.C.!
- Meet Howard.
- Wow! Hi, oh, Howie.
We've heard so much about you.
Of course, we didn't believe it.
Yo, how weird.
- Hi ducky.
- Hi toots.
How's the world been treating you?
- Guess.
- I was worried about you.
- I missed you.
- Well, sex appeal...
- Some guys got it... and some guys don't.
- Howard...
Listen, I'm sorry we fought.
You're the only friend I've got here.
Hi, sorry I missed the show.
I came to watch you undress, though.
And I brought a pizza.
Howard!
Boy!
Thank God you're back.
I've been working on the mystery of your arrival.
What's he doing here?
Well, he and Ronette have sort of got back together.
I don't know who's more desperate for dates, you or me.
What?
Anyway, Howard, I was talking to some astrolo-physicists.
You know, the guys who discovered that Aztecs came from Mars?
- Well, these guys concluded...
- No!
...that you arrived here in a space craft millions of years ago...
- and must've remained frozen in ice.
- Go away!
- Ronette, could you shut this boy up?
- Howard...
- What's a pizza?
- It's a circular Italian food object.
Howard, I didn't buy that theory either, so I did some research... and I discovered an ancient race of large ducks worshipped by...
- primitive Somoans.
- Leave me alone!
I was barking up the wrong tree.
I knew that.
But tonight I am getting concrete evidence about how you got here.
- Yeah...
- Wait a minute. Oh, I gotta make a call.
- Phil?
- No sex now, I'm working.
Got a place to stay tonight?
Oh, yeah, by the way, I forgot.
- I had a little talk with your manager Ginger?
- You talked to that slime?
- What for?
- I got your money from him.
Ducky, I can't believe this!
I also got him to agree that it was time for him to step aside as your manager.
What? You got rid of Ginger?
- Mr. Duck, you're wonderful.
- Yeah...
This is it! I'm out of here!
- Good.
- Howard!
I'm about to meet secretly with my colleague, and he's bringing The Feather.
What feather?
- What are you talking...
- If it matches...
- it'll be the answer to all your problems.
- Matches? No, you don't!
Stay away from me!
- You leave him alone!
- Let me through!
God, get a grip!
I'm about to unravel the mystery of your arrival!
- Come back here, you hairless ape!
- You'll have time to thank me later!
- Get out of here, geek!
- We're gonna be famous.
- Are you okay?
- Ah, it's just my pride.
We'll go home, ducky.
Alright.
Hey!
- Little tune I never finished.
- You play pretty good.
I had a group in high school.
Howard and the Heartbreakers.
Oh, heavy, Howard, very heavy.
Maybe you should be our manager.
Wait a second.
Maybe you're just the kind of bizarro-influence we need.
- Forget it. No more jobs here.
- I think you'd be a great manager.
- I'm gonna suggest it to the girls.
- I've given up trying to assimilate.
I've gotta get back to my own kind.
Although...
I have developed a greater appreciation... for the female version of the human anatomy.
Howard, you really are the worst.
Come on, let's watch David Letterman.
Come on.
Okey-dokey.
- You know, I got a feeling my life's really gonna change...
- since you fell into it, ducky.
- Yeah, well, I'm glad somebody's happy.
If I could just get my career back on course...
I'd only have the old standard worry left.
- What's that?
- I just can't seem to find the right man.
Maybe it's not a man you should be looking for.
You think I might find happiness in the animal kingdom, ducky?
Like they say, doll, love's strange.
We could always give it a try.
Okay...
Let's go for it, Mr. Macho.
What do you mean, okay? It was a joke.
Listen, I'm pretty tired.
It's just that you're so incredibly soft and cuddly.
Bev, let's be realistic.
I mean, my apartment's zillions of miles from here.
You're three feet taller that I am.
I just can't resist your intense animal magnetism.
Whoops...
Anyway, where will it all lead?
Marriage? Kids?
A house in the suburbs?
Let's just face it.
- It's fate.
- No, it's not!
- I've got a headache.
- And I've got the aspirin.
Be gentle.
Just one good night kiss, sweet ducky?
Come on, Howard, I was just kidding.
Good night.
My God.
This relationship... it defies all the laws of nature.
No, it doesn't.
This is not what you think.
We're just very good friends.
- Phil?
- I'm sorry. The door was open.
- Who the hell are they?
- This is my friend Carter... and this is Dr. Walter Jenning.
And I told them all about you, Howard.
You were obviously right.
- Show, show him the evidence.
- What evidence?
We tested them, and they're both from the same fowl.
You, Howard.
- My feathers?
- Howard, Howard, don't go beserk!
- No!
- On my planet, we never say die...
- we say kill!
- Now, wait a minute.
Listen to me, small visitor.
I can explain how you got here.
Dr. Jenning is in charge of the
Astro-Physics Lab at Dyna-Technics.
- Now, on the night of September 18th.
- That's the night Howard landed.
Yes, now on that night we were initiating our first...
- full scale test of the Laser Spectra scope.
- This was shot during the experiment.
It was just a routine procedure meant to measure... the density of the gases that surround the Alpha Centauri.
However, part way through the experiment, there was a deviation and... we lost control of the laser spectra scope.
- What do you mean, "lost control"?
- Some unknown force... was re-directing the laser beam from its original target...
- so that it hit your planet instead.
- Hit my planet?
How about hitting my living room?
Talk about an invasion of privacy.
When the beam hit, you must have been caught up in a massive... energy inversion, which literally dragged you through space... back to the power source here on earth.
- Radical.
- In the lab that night... we saw a single feather fall.
We weren't aware that the rest of you, Howard... had landed in that alley just two miles away.
- Any questions?
- Yeah. Where are my pants?
- Howard, where you going?
- To this lab of theirs.
- What for?
- To hop back on board that laser thing.
Then all you have to do is hit the reverse lever to send me back home. Right?
Well, we hadn't considered reversing the process.
- I don't think it's feasible.
- Me, either.
Now, wait a minute.
If we could generate...
- a strong enough hyper-charge...
- You can't do that.
You mean the reflex mode might provoke a total reversal?
- It just might be possible.
- It won't work.
- Yeah.
- Sir.
Don't, don't listen to them, Howard.
I have got you booked on A.M. Cleveland.
We can get the cover of Science Digest. We, we...
- Butt Out, four-eyes.
- Yeah.
Look, you guys, could you really send him back?
If we did, we could establish a continuing link between our planets.
But, he would have to leave tonight while the alignment still exists.
We can't afford to wait.
You mean I'm finally gonna breeze this fly trap?
Ducky, this is what you wanted.
You're going home.
- Yeah.
- Right.
Carter, call Larry have him set up the initiation procedure.
Tell him I'll meet him at the lab right away.
You and Blumburtt can bring Howard.
You are about to make history a second time, my little friend.
Thanks... but once was plenty.
- Get to it.
- Right.
You know, Howard, we could hold out for a PBS special.
Phil!
Bev, get dressed.
Aren't you gonna see me off?
Sure I am. I just hope they let you take a carry-on bag.
Look, I'm gonna put on these Polaroids that we took at the Club.
Thanks. These'll help... or the guys back home are never gonna believe me.
- What's this in my bag?
- Souvenirs...
- I'm gonna miss you a lot, ducky.
- Bev...
I don't belong here.
You know I've gotta go.
Yeah.
Lily had the dolphins.
Cousteau, the whales.
Goudall the gorillas. I had a duck.
I could have been a contender.
Bev? I'm not a real sentimental guy.
No, I bet you were born from a very hard-boiled egg, ducky.
Yeah. But, I do keep wondering...
Of all the alleys in the world
I could have fallen into that night...
Why did it have to be yours?
Because, right now... you're the one and only thing that's making it very hard for me to leave.
- There's no guard.
- We should go back then, huh?
Phil!
- What?
- Drive.
What are these alarms?
- Something's happened.
- What's happened?
I don't know.
- That is really cool.
- Right. Hold it!
Security!
My eyes! My eyes!
It exploded again! It was terrible!
We have no right to tamper with the universe.
This does not hold well.
Is he okay?
- Get out of the way!
- It's still hot!
Get them out of here!
Head for the emergency exits!
Howard, where are you going?
- Larry, where's Dr. Jenning?
- Carter, come here. Let me show you this.
He was pre-activating the laser spectra-scope.
We lost control again and there was another explosion.
And, Jenning caught the full force of the blast this time.
Is he alright? Where is he?
You see the bottom of the spectra scope blew it to the wall...
- and Jenning just... just disappeared.
- Excuse me.
But is this gonna delay my take-off?
Is that... is that it?
That's unbelievable!
Yeah. We brought Howard down the first time, but what if...
My God, Larry, what if we brought down something else this time?
We're rounding up all the scientists for you in the lab, sir... but I think you better take a look at this other... this other thing first.
A thing... Hansen?
Is that kind of precise, descriptive techniques they're teaching Rookies nowadays? A thing?
I wanna know what they're doing with Howard...
- Excuse me, are you in charge here?
- Yeah. Why?
Well, I wanna know why they're harassing Howard.
Who's Howard?
He had nothing to do with it.
Howard, Howard is just an innocent...
- thing?
- No, duck!
Just an innocent duck?
They wonder why I'm asking for an early retirement.
- You deal with this.
- Wait a second, you can't...
Kirby, you got a "thing" in here, huh?
Thing.
I've had enough! I wanna see my lawyer.
I've got rights, you know? I'm suing.
Yeah.
Goddamnit, Hansen, get in here and get this friggen duck suit off this nut!
Sir!
- Alright, get him!
- Hey, hey, let me go! You big oafs!
On my planet we never say die, we say...
- Not my shorts!
- Why not?
You perverts!
- Lieutenant?
- Lieutenant, there's no zipper.
There's no buttons. No velcro, sir.
I think the suspect's stuff is like inboard, sir.
- Yeah. I think he's for real.
- If your goons are finished!
Let go on me!
I'd like a word with those so-called scientists out there!
- Oh, yeah? What about?
- About when they can rev up that machine...
- and send me back home.
- Listen, Howard...
I'm gonna go talk to the scientists out there.
You are gonna go play sitting duck in a jail cell.
- Lieutenant, what's the charge, sir?
- Illegal alien.
Come on.
- I'll get the car.
- Alright.
- Oh, a cigar!
- Alright, that's how it starts.
Police brutality!
- Hey, stop manhandling him!
- Hey, you can't come in here.
Here's another one already lift.
- Oh, nuts, I dropped my cigar.
- What?
Fire!
- Fire...
- Oh, geez, that's all I need.
So long, copper!
Desperate ducks commit desperate acts!
Freeze!
Book him, ducko!
Give her the keys to the cuffs, flatfoot!
Yeah.
What are you doing here tonight?
You got no ID.
- Lieutenant?
- What?
The duck got away.
Shut up, fool! Get him out of here!
Over here on the double.
Okay. I want this guy.
The suspect is three foot one inches tall.
- Three-two, thank you.
- You heard me.
He's armed.
That means he's got a weapon, right?
- That also means he's dangerous.
- Moi?
Extremely dangerous.
Shoot to kill!
Let's move it out! Come on!
Richard, come with me.
Okay...
Let's go.
- No, don't shoot.
- We give up!
- Time out!
- We surrender.
- Dr. Jenning?
- What?
- More cops. Come on, hurry!
- What?
- Come here.
- Get over here, Doc.
- Howard, Howard...
- What?
The laser spectra-scope malfunctioned again.
There was a tremendous explosion and then...
I must have blacked out.
Then suddenly I find myself out here.
- Are they after you?
- Does "shoot to kill" sound serious?
I'm probably finished, too.
Those experiments were unauthorized.
They're probably gonna blame me.
Oh, my God, he needs help.
- Maybe we all should get out of here.
- You got a car, doc?
What's wrong with me?
There's the back gate.
- Good, there's no cops.
- I don't have a gate key.
You've got a foot, don't you?
So step on it.
Lieutenant, a car crashed out the back gate.
- Headed towards Highway 5.
- Alright, get out an all points.
- Bulletin right now.
- Yes, sir!
How the hell am I gonna explain a manhunt for a duck?
- It's a duck hunt.
- Hansen, please, don't start. Please?
Can't you understand?
I'm telling you I saw something!
Doc, you're in shock from the explosion.
- And you're imagining things.
- Watch where you're going, damn it!
Listen, an evil has landed.
The world is in great danger.
Yeah, it certainly is when you're out on the highway.
Look out!
You're gonna get us killed.
It feels like something inside me gnawing at my guts!
- What's wrong with me?
- Well, what did you have for lunch?
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
Come on, give us a break!
Don't close your eyes.
The pain.
It's like I'm transforming inside.
I'm afraid I'm about to become something else.
- Oh, great, like a sex change or something.
- Something's growing inside me.
It's replicating and superseding all my internal organs!
Well, we'll stop at a bathroom, huh?
That monster's shape I saw.
No!
- Jenning!
- It's inside my body.
This guy's delirious.
He's not making any sense.
It's too late.
The end of the world is coming... and I will be the cause of it.
Jenning, slow down!
Steer, you big yo-yo! Steer!
Howard, step on the brake!
Step on the brake!
Oh, no! White line, wrong way.
- The brake! Push, Beverly, push!
- I'm trying!
I'm dead.
Yes, you are.
- You think that's funny, Jenning?
- I'm not Jenning any more.
The transformation is complete.
I am now someone else.
Try telling that to your insurance company.
I think he needs come coffee. Come on.
Oh, after you.
- Hey!
- Sorry.
This is why I hate the night shift.
I'm sorry, we don't allow pets on the premises.
Hey, have a heart. Seeing eye duck.
Touching, isn't he?
Not so tight. What are you doing?
Falling in love?
Yeah, sit down.
I need a beer bad. Gotta find a waitress.
Yeah.
- Hey, honey! You!
- Yeah, I'm coming.
- Here she comes.
- Wow!
Your kid's costume is really radical.
I'll bet he's crazy about...
- It...
- Yeah, I'm very attached to him.
Your dad's sort of in his own space.
What do you think he'd like to eat?
I no longer need human food.
I know it's a drag... but you're gonna have to order some food if you wanna sit here, so... how about the specials on the menu?
You are about to witness the end of the old world... and the birth of the new.
Hey, is he like one of those
TV-Evangelists or something?
- Yeah...
- Or something.
- I'm gonna kill somebody.
- It's okay, Howard.
Why don't we just have three specials and three beers?
Right.
- Poor girl.
- Listen... Dr. J.!
If you could tune back into reality for a second.
I don't understand anything you're talking about.
All I know is I need that laser machine to get me home.
Is it still working, Jenning? Jenning!
I told you, bird brain,
I am not Jenning any more!
I am now one of the Dark Overlords of the universe.
- Dark Overlord of the universe?
- That must be quite a responsibility.
Tonight the laser beam hit the Nexus of Sominus.
What is that? A suburb of Cleveland?
It lies beyond the planets.
It is a region of demons... to which we Dark Overlords were exiled eons ago.
- I hope you're getting all this.
- Howard, what I'm getting is... that this man is very, very sick.
Just as you were brought down here accidentally.
Tonight, the laser beam released me... from that region of demons and pulled me down into that lab.
Small universe...
During the explosion
I entered Jenning's body.
So...
I have disguised my true form... which would be considered hideous and revolting here.
Lucky for the people eating.
You ordered the specials, what's wrong?
This will mean the extinction of all existing life forms.
- But you haven't even tasted it yet.
- What do you think?
- I'm into cannibalism or something?
- Hey.
Are we like all in the same discussion here?
I'll give you a hint, doll.
What's white, ovoid...
- and always reminds me of my birthday?
- I don't know.
The eggs! Get them out of here!
Gosh!
You know, hostility is like psychic boomerang.
I can't believe this planet!
Fried eggs. Yuck!
- Just bring the beer!
- Howard? Howard!
- What happened?
- How the hell did you do that?
- My powers are growing.
- Watch out!
- It is time now.
- What's that?
It is the code key.
It will activate the laser spectra scope... when I use it tonight to bring down the other Dark Overlords.
- The others?
- Now he's got a whole gang.
Well, screw them.
I got dibs on the laser first.
Gimme that code key.
That's my ticket home!
- Look at his hand!
- It's nothing. Look at his face!
Yes. Soon the Dark Overlords will engulf the Earth.
- Nothing human will remain here.
- Nothing duck's remaining here either!
- Move, we're going!
- You will get the check?
- Hate to eat and run.
- Hello there.
- Get out of the way.
- Hey, look the talking duck.
- Bug off!
- Lord, what is that?
You jackass, he's a ventriloquist.
This guy here is doing the talking and this here's the dummy.
Go ahead, say something, dummy!
You might not wanna hear what I'll say, Bozo!
Did you make him say that, jerk-off?
Leave him alone!
He was just in an industrial accident.
- So take a hike, Cowboy!
- You...
- You're a dead duck!
- Hey!
- What's this? The key to your duck-mobile?
- Gimme that or you're gonna be sorry.
Better watch out, he's a master of quack-foo!
I'll quack-foo him!
Come on, Bev, run!
All nice! Going up!
I'm sorry!
Howard! Howard!
This one's for you, cracker!
- Good shot! Good shot!
- Another hungry customer!
- You...
- Toro, toro! Olé!
I'm gonna get you, you dumb duck!
Hey, boy!
- Call the police!
- Not the police!
Call somebody else!
They're gonna hurt Howard.
An evil unlike any you can imagine is about to engulf the Earth.
Oh, no, no, we have fights in here all the time.
- Your order is ready.
- Are you gonna just sit there?
- She took my eggs!
- One special!
- Howard!
- Beverly!
- Howard!
- Jenning!
- I could use some help here, buddy!
- Come on, let's get out of here!
Howard?
You're not getting away now, you stinking little bird!
Hands off my feathers! Put me down!
Put me down right now!
Put him down!
Howard may be a duck but you people are animals!
He's my boyfriend!
That's disgusting.
You don't make me proud to be a human!
Let me just pay the check and I'm out of here.
- Freeze!
- I can't believe that you're just sitting here.
Look what they're doing to Howard!
- Oh, geez!
- Chicken fry!
Where's the SPCA when you need them?
- I am not amused!
- I'm gonna barbecue your bill, bird.
Oh, Great Duck in Heaven, this is the end of Howard.
There's gonna be more violence!
I hate violence!
You gotta go in there and beat them up.
Jenning! Jenning, don't just sit there!
This is serious!
- They're gonna cook me!
- Take that!
- Stuff him!
- Any last words?
Yeah, Jenning!
- He's my favorite duck.
- You hardly know him.
Jenning! They're seasoning me!
Wait, you better let me up.
- You don't wanna get my friend angry!
- Oh, yeah? Why?
Because he's one of the
Dark Overlords of the universe.
And he can destroy you and the Earth, everything.
Yeah, well, I didn't buy it at first either.
Look, they're laughing at you and they've got Mr. Code Key.
Oh, my God!
- One, two...
- Wait a minute! Jenning!
Look! I warned you! Here he comes!
- He must have ate the chili.
- Release the small water fowl!
- Bring me the code key, Howard.
- Right! The code key!
You heard him! Cut me loose!
Sounds like a brunch of bull-puckie to me!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
- Are you okay, Howard?
- Yes.
- Enough of this crap!
- You, out of here!
If you can't take the heat, get out of that kitchen!
- Where's the code key?
- It's closing time!
- The code key!
- It's not nice to fool with the Dark Overlord.
- They get the point, Jenning!
- Get out of the way!
- Now's our chance.
- Yeah, come on. This way.
Cut it out, Howard.
- Going somewhere?
- Yeah, without you!
- Move the table out of the way!
- I can't, it's stuck!
What's wrong?
Howard, get down from there!
- Like I'm doing this on purpose?
- Give me the code key!
Yeah? What if I don't?
Can't you take a joke?
Geez, you broke my head.
I will now bring down the other Dark Overlords.
Hey, what about me?
You filthy scum bucket!
Run!
No! Beverly!
Beverly?
Look out!
You killed him! You killed him!
Beverly, I'll find you!
- I need your body.
- Creep, I've heard that one before!
The Dark Overlords cannot exist on this planet...
- unless they grow inside a human body.
- God, no!
I hurt! Need energy.
Watch out!
More energy!
That's the grossest! I'm gonna puke!
Oh, God!
There was this big guy and this girl and this little kid.
At least I thought it was a little kid.
Then I flashed on reality, right! Bam!
Halloween's not till next month.
I know my rights. Where's my baseball cap?
- Shut up!
- Bastards!
No handle...
Philsey!
Philsey!
Philsey! It's me.
Howard.
Howard, I got arrested at the plant.
I'm gonna have a criminal record.
Jenning kidnapped Beverly.
He's taking her back to that science lab.
- What? Why?
- He's some kind of monster.
He's gonna bring down more of his buddies.
He's got big plans.
Like taking over Earth.
Philsey, we gotta get out of here.
Howard, this door doesn't have any handles...
Get a rock or something and break this window.
- Rock?
- Window.
Let me try the door first.
- How we getting out of here?
- Come on.
Philsey, where we goin'?
Hey, over here.
- It'll be dawn soon.
- Hey, let's steal a cop car.
Don't you think that would be a little conspicuous?
- Hitchhike? Cab?
- What is that?
Geez! It looks like an airplane.
Well, it will be.
We can put it together in no time.
Somebody's weekend hobby's gonna get us back to that lab.
Hey, we've got a saying on my planet.
If God intended us to fly, he wouldn't have taken away our wings.
That's really profound, Howard.
Could you find the tool box?
Yeah, I know why you want a tool box.
You got a screw loose.
Power.
Oh, no...
They just spotted the duck and the kid.
- Where?
- Behind the warehouse next door.
- They're about to take off.
- What do you mean, "take off"?
- It's not doing anything.
- Cops!
- Come on, push forward on the throttle!
- Okay, yeah.
Full throttle! Full throttle!
- Cops, Philsey!
- 180, Howard.
Right.
One away!
Go! Go!
Come on! Hurry! Come on!
- There's cops everywhere!
- Not in the air, Howard! Up, up!
Look out!
Prepare for a take-off.
No, no!
Follow them!
Bring them down and bring them back!
I want that duck! Dead or alive!
- It's south-southwest, Howard!
- What?
That way. Stay low!
Beverly, I'm coming to get you, sweetheart!
Help me! Help! Somebody help me!
Please, help me!
Please watch your step.
I think you're all gonna find this very interesting.
You know, honestly, congressman... this three-mile-island-China-syndrome- meltdown-stuff, that's all history.
The only melt downs around here are the cheese sandwiches in the toaster oven.
Whoa... These Washington guys take a real beating on these junkets.
Our nuclear reactor is pumping out one million kilowatts of power.
One million kilowatts...
- power!
- Yes, sir.
Listen, I think we could all use a cup of coffee.
Help! Somebody help me, please! Help!
Let's go! Come on! Go, go!
Run! Run! Run!
I feel much better.
- Now look at that!
- Right pedal! Right pedal!
- Damn it, that was too close!
- I'm just learning here!
Howard, in pre-historic times you flew.
Fly, Howard! Find your instincts.
Trust your birdness. Fly!
Howard, pull up! Pull up!
- Touch down!
- Great landing, Howard... but this isn't gonna get us to the lab.
You said to follow my instincts.
This is my nesting instinct.
Oh, no!
- I'm flying blind here.
- Shut up! You're not flying at all!
- Let her rip!
- Bombs away!
Pull it up, Howard, were running outta land!
- Wet stuff ahead!
- Watch out!
Death from the sky to all duck hunters!
Tora, tora, tora!
Vengeance is mine! Yeah!
Howard!
Banzai!
Slow down. Slow down here.
Hey! Hey, you, pull over here!
This is a smog device inspection.
- And I need... Shut off the engine!
- It is off! Somebody's pushing!
Shut it down! Shut it down!
What the hell is wrong with you?
- I wanna see your license, Jack!
- I have no license, I am not Jack.
Smog inspection!
What happened?
We gotta get outta here!
- Damage report, Philsey!
- Fuel hose is busted!
Rotor is wasted.
Basically, we're dying here, Howard.
- I'm bailing out!
- No, you're not!
You're gonna get up there and fix this lawn mower now!
- Philsey, how's it going?
- I'm getting close.
- I'm on top of it!
- Good.
Relax, Howard, I almost got it!
Philsey, I did a loop-the-loop.
I'm getting good at this! I'm...
Howard!
Up, Howard!
Up!
Geez, I thought I lost you.
Philsey, this is no time for water sports.
I'm just kidding, big guy.
Please, scum, let me go!
- Philsey, get back up here!
- I'm trying!
No, no, don't shoot!
I'm an innocent hostage!
- The duck's a lunatic!
- What?
He's a duck terrorist!
He hijacked the plane!
Howard, pull it up!
- Welcome back, Philsey!
- Thanks, it's great to be back, Howard!
Will you watch the road, damn it?
Hey, another car. No big deal!
- Yes, big deal! Big...
- What?
Big, big, big...
- No wings.
- Welcome to the club.
Coming through!
That was a lot of fun.
I'd like to get off now.
Slow down.
Slow down!
Relax, I'll just throttle this baby back.
Yikes!
- Philsey! I better tell you now.
- What?
I can't swim!
Philsey, help! Philsey, help me!
Never heard of a duck that couldn't swim.
Shut up and save me!
We've been through hell!
Now, if there's some kind of monster in here... Howard this is crazy!
Phil, no duck is an island and if fate sent me here to save Earth... then Howard the Duck is ready to fight!
Damn!
Yikes!
- He's starting the spectra scope.
- Geez...
He's gonna bring down another Dark Overlord.
- We gotta get Beverly outta there.
- Hey, take it easy, Conan.
What are you gonna fight him with?
We gotta find some kind of... Wait!
Carter showed me something here once that might do it, if we can find it!
You'll never get away with this!
We'll find it! Come on, Philsey!
You don't scare me!
Oh, boy, defense research!
This is it! This is it! This is locked!
Okay, I know where it is.
It's on the right or the left or the...
There it is. The neutron disintegrator.
- And a big lock.
- Rats!
Okay, alright.
Turn me into a Dark Overlord.
I'll still spit in your wormy face!
Welcome to Dyna-Technics.
Authorized personnel only.
Please insert code key.
Authorized personnel only.
Thank you. Hello Dr. Jenning.
Please select your target and enter target coordinates.
Thank you. Laser spectra scope is now targeting the Nexus of Sominus.
Targeting is in process.
Come on, Philsey! Hit it harder!
Way to go!
- Hurry up!
- The neutron disintegrator... was developed for the Army until he cost overance...
- became really embarrassing...
- Can it stop Jenning?
Theoretically yes.
Unfortunately it's never been tested.
Attention, all personnel, please leave the station... while laser doors are opening.
Please, initiate spectra scope extension.
Target is now locked.
Target is now locked.
Is this like stick-shift or automatic?
Howard, you have to get into firing range without him seeing you!
Right. I'll sneak up on him and then I'll blast him!
Do you wish to bring the laser to full power?
Dr. Jenning, I repeat:
Do you wish to bring the laser to full power?
Thank you.
- What's this do?
- No, Howard, that's the accelerator!
Howard!
- You're in big trouble now!
- Shut up!
Run, Howard! He's in a bad mood!
Come on, Philsey, move!
Let's crank her up!
- Hurry!
- Where's that button?
It won't start!
- Watch out!
- Jump, Howard!
- This is our only chance!
- Get outta there.
- Duck!
- And proud of it!
Philsey, you saved my life!
Are you all right?
- Terrific, Howard.
- It still won't start!
- Try the seat belt, Howard.
- Seat belt?
Watsabe misua!
You little pond hopper.
Go, Howard, go!
Talk about bad breath!
Turn it! Charge!
Now it's my turn.
Dark Overlord, I want you!
Prepare to eat beak!
So long, sucker!
Howard!
No!
Howard?
Howard?
- Oh, boy!
- Howard?
- Howard!
- You're alright?
I need this like I need another tail!
- You did it!
- Hey! Get me down from here!
Come on!
- Dr. Jenning?
- Howard, it's not...
- It's not what?
- The evil's not inside me any more.
The explosion must have released it and it's loose!
- What about me?
- The Dark Overlord is still here.
Well, then I suggest we get Beverly and get the hell outta here!
Philsey, get her down from there!
- What took you so long?
- Nothing. Just got arrested... shot at, handcuffed...
I got thrown out of an airplane!
- Guys?
- He stuck his tongue in a cigarette lighter!
Cigarette lighter?
That's really disgusting!
- Guys?
- What?
Oh, my God!
Phil, Phil. Get up! Get up!
- It's coming!
- It's coming! I was just resting.
Look!
There will be no escape!
Good boy, stay back! Stay back. Oh, boy!
Howard!
There goes Howard!
We've gotta help Howard, Phill!
- What? Yeah, gotta help Howard!
- We gotta help!
- Come on. Howard!
- Here we go!
Going somewhere, Howard?
- There's no escape.
- Philsey! Dr. Jenning! Mother!
- Do you wish to active the laser?
- Yes.
Thank you, Dr. Jenning.
- He started the activation sequence.
- He's gonna bring down more of them.
You may fire when ready.
Four minutes to arrival.
Philsey, Beverly, anybody! Help!
Three minutes, thirty seconds to arrival.
Howard! Here!
Alright!
Slice salami!
Yuck!
Did you lose something?
Alien specimens are arriving in laboratory in three minutes.
Alright!
Eat claw, duck!
- Two minutes to arrival.
- Belt, butt, trigger!
One minute, thirty seconds to arrival.
Puny little duck!
Yeah!
One minute to arrival.
Howard!
There's more coming down.
The machine, Howard.
You've got to destroy it! Blast it!
Get them!
No, Howard, don't!
- You'll never get home.
- Thirty seconds to arrival.
Get them!
Goodbye, Duck World. Get outta there. Run!
- Come on!
- Ten seconds and counting to arrival.
- Over here!
- Ten, nine, eight... seven, six, five, four... three, two, one... arrival.
Howard!
Oh, no...
I don't know where you are now... but I hope you're happier there.
This world didn't treat you very good... but you saved it, didn't you?
Howard?
I am not Howard anymore.
Geez! All this smoke, it's murder on the sinuses.
Fooled you, didn't I?
- Howard...
- It's alright, toots.
Well, alright, I'd like to dedicate this song to our new manager!
Go!
Alright, get the mechanical.
We're gonna release the big wave-0.
Cue and ready. Cue and go!
- Howard, Howard. Help me out!
- Yeah?
- Release that rope there!
- Gotcha!
- Not that one!
- Philsey, what's going on?
Get me down from here!
I've done enough flying. Philsey!
Philsey!
Philsey, do you realize
I could have been killed up there?
- What's this?
- Rock 'n' Roll!
Right!
Give me four!
Yeah!
Big, big, baby.
Is that hot enough for you?
Hit a purple "A" for you all.
Do it!
That's me!
Thank you! Thank you! We love ya!
- Howard, Howard, Howard, Howard!
- Thank you!
We love you!
Not bad for a duck from outer space.
You were great, ducky.
Uther!
Merlin!
Merlin, I am the strongest.
I am the one.
The sword! You promised me the sword!
And you shall have it, but to heal, not to hack.
Tomorrow...
...a truce. We meet at the river.
Talk! Talk is for lovers, Merlin.
I need a sword to be king.
Show the sword.
Behold the sword of power.
Excalibur.
Forged when the world was young...
...and bird, and beast, and flower...
...were one with man...
...and death was but a dream.
Speak the words.
One land, one king!
That is my peace, Cornwall.
Lord Uther, if I yield to the sword of power...
...what will you yield?
Me, yield?
He has given. Now you must.
The land from here to the sea shall be yours...
...if you enforce the King's will.
Done!
Good.
King Uther, let's feast together.
To my castle.
My wife will dance for us.
Igrayne, dance!
You may be king, Uther...
...but no queen of yours could ever match her.
I must have her.
Are you mad? The alliance.
I must have her.
And risk everything you've won?
King Uther.
You'll never batter this down...
...and you'll never have Igrayne!
Merlin! Where are you?
- Have you found him?
- I haven't.
He's here, all right.
He won't show himself.
Where have you been?
I have walked my way since the beginning of time.
Sometimes I give, sometimes I take.
It is mine to know which and when.
- You must help me, Merlin!
- Must I?
I am your king.
So you need me again, now that my truce is wrecked.
Years to build and moments to ruin, and all for lust.
For Igrayne.
One night with her.
You don't understand. You're not a man.
Use the magic! Do it!
Igrayne.
You will swear by your true kingship...
...to grant me what I wish.
Then you shall have it.
By Excalibur, I swear it.
What issues from your lust shall be mine.
Swear it again.
I swear it!
They have given up. It's over.
Not quite.
When night falls, we'll follow them and finish them.
I dreamt of the Dragon.
I have awoken him.
Can't you see, all around you, the Dragon's breath?
We have drawn him out.
The Duke is off to pursue your men.
There he goes.
Good.
Mount your horse.
I will transform you into the semblance of the Duke.
Igrayne will think her husband has returned.
But the cliff, the sea?
Your lust will hold you up.
You will float on the Dragon's breath.
Ride!
Ride!
Take on the outer shape of the Duke.
Change!
Transform!
Now!
That's it.
That's it.
It's the Duke.
The Duke has returned. Open the gates.
Have the horse ready.
I ride out before sunrise.
Uther!
Find the King. Find Uther.
Uther, come out and fight.
We're under attack. It's Cornwall.
My father is dead.
Hush, Morgana, hush.
My father, my father is dead.
Look.
Here's your father.
It was just a dream, little one.
Come, Igrayne.
Go to sleep.
My lord.
The future has taken root in the present.
It is done.
When? Where?
In the camp of Uther, my lady...
...just after nightfall.
It can't be.
He came to me...
...to his bed, last night.
What shall become of us?
Lord Uther, my lady.
It will be for him to say.
Oh, Morgana.
The King. The King.
Wait!
Out!
- What is it, lady?
- A boy, sir.
- Send the girl away.
- She's only a child.
- Out!
- Go, Morgana.
She watches me with her father's eyes.
Is it mine or his?
A man came to me...
...and loved me...
...and made this child.
I thought it was my husband...
...but he was already dead.
All I know is how to butcher men.
From now on, I shall learn to love them.
I am weary of battle.
I shall stay by his side...
...and his mother's.
He's hungry.
Merlin, you come when you're not asked...
...and pay no heed when I call you.
Oh, I have slept for nine moons.
What I did for you wasn't easy.
Now you must pay me.
The child is mine.
You made an oath.
They were hasty words, Merlin.
This is flesh and blood.
Uther, is this true?
Don't let him take the child.
I swore an oath, Igrayne.
I made a pact with Merlin.
It was you!
You came to me that night.
You are the father!
It's not for you, Uther...
...hearth and home, wife and child.
To kill and be king, is that all?
Perhaps not even that.
You strike me with words hard as steel.
You betrayed the Duke, you stole his wife...
...you took his castle, now no one trusts you.
You're not the one, Uther.
Give me the child.
I will protect him.
No!
Why?
Take him.
Take the devil child.
No!
Why the baby?
No! Go after him!
That's it.
Sleep now.
Go after him!
Get him back!
Are you the mother and father of the baby now, Merlin?
Where are you?
I want my son.
Attack!
Ambush!
Help me, Ulfius.
The King's bodyguard! Look out!
The King! The King is ambushed!
Excalibur.
The sword!
The King's sword.
Merlin, where are you?
Call your Dragon...
...to weave a mist...
...to hide us.
Merlin, where are you?
Nobody shall have the sword.
Nobody shall wield Excalibur...
...but me.
Uther!
He who draws the sword from the stone, he shall be king.
Arthur...
...you're the one.
Now remember, my sons, what I've told you.
Pay no heed to these robber knights.
You, Kay, be brave and honest and merciful...
...as a knight should be.
And you, Arthur, be modest and true...
...and help your brother to uphold the good name of Morven.
I remember my first joust.
It looks far worse than it feels.
Camelyarde! Camelyarde!
God, send us a true king.
We are unworthy...
...but the land bleeds, the people suffer.
We have sinned, but on this Easter Day...
...when Christ rose from the dead, may one knight here...
...through victory in arms find the grace...
...to draw the sword and be king.
By my right of victory...
...by my blood...
...give me the power.
All knights prepare and be ready...
...who would joust for the right to draw the sword...
...from the stone.
Arthur, where is Kay's sword?
A good squire doesn't forget his knight's sword.
I left it in the tent, Father.
Well hurry then, and get it.
Stolen!
I'll see what's keeping him.
Well hurry, you'll miss your chance.
Your sword was stolen, but here is Excalibur.
Kay?
Did you free Excalibur from the stone?
Yes.
No, I didn't. Arthur did.
The sword! The sword!
You freed it, Arthur?
I did, Father. I beg your forgiveness.
You must put it back.
Now try to draw it again, Arthur.
Wait! I, Uryens, will try.
Stand back.
Let the boy try.
Let the boy try.
Come on, Arthur. Don't be afraid.
We have our king! Thanks be to God!
Rise, Father, please.
I was your son before I became your king...
...if I am king.
You are king...
...the more so, because you are not my son...
...and I am not your father.
Not my father?
Then Kay is not my brother?
Merlin the magician brought you to me when you were newly born...
...and bade me raise you as my own.
At first I did so because I feared Merlin, but later...
...because I loved you.
Who is my true father?
Only Merlin can tell you that.
And who is Merlin?
I am Merlin.
Whose son am I?
You are the son of Uther and Igrayne...
...you are King Arthur.
We haven't forgotten you.
What trickery is this?
He's trying to foist a fatherless boy upon us.
Do you want a bastard as a king?
Lord Leondegrance, join us against the boy.
I saw what I saw.
The boy drew the sword.
If a boy has been chosen...
...a boy shall be king.
No, I challenge that.
The sword has been drawn.
Are you with us or against us?
Against you.
Why have you done this to me?
Because you were born to be king.
What does it mean to be king?
You will be the land, and the land will be you.
If you fail, the land will perish.
As you thrive, the land will blossom.
- Why?
- Because you are king.
No!
- What are you afraid of?
- I don't know.
- Shall I tell you what's out there?
- Yes, please.
The Dragon.
A beast of such power...
...that if you were to see it whole and complete in a single glance...
...it would burn you to cinders.
- Where is it?
- It is everywhere.
It is everything.
Its scales glisten in the bark of trees.
Its roar is heard in the wind.
And its forked tongue strikes like...
Like lightning. Yes, that's it.
How can I...?
What shall I...? Must I...?
Do nothing.
Be still. Sleep.
Rest in the arms of the Dragon.
Dream.
Excalibur. It's part of the Dragon, too.
Oh, yes.
Oh, you learn quickly.
That's good.
I like that.
What kind of man was my father?
Oh, he was brave, he was strong.
He was a great knight.
Was he a great king?
Well, he was rash.
He never learned how to look into men's hearts.
Least of all his own.
You loved him?
Well, it is easy to love folly in a child.
Merlin, will you help me to be wise, not to be rash?
Where are you going?
Where do you think?
You have a kingdom to rule.
But how? I don't know how.
You knew how to draw the sword from the stone.
- That was easy.
- Was it?
I couldn't have done it.
You couldn't?
You're the King, not I.
But where to start?
Well, what do you think has happened since you ran off?
Sir Ector and Kay.
They must be waiting all this time.
Most of the great knights were against me.
Except Leondegrance of Camelyarde.
But if he supports me, the others will turn against him.
Even now they lay siege to his castle.
I need him. We must help him.
There you are.
That was easy, too, wasn't it?
We have to get back.
That's it.
Now...
There they are.
Well, you go and show them.
Arthur, I knew you wouldn't fail us.
Go on.
I picked out a horse for you.
All these men are loyal.
Now what do you want us to do?
We waited here for you.
Any man who would be a knight...
...and follow a king, follow me.
Where to? Where are we going?
Leondegrance, his castle is under siege.
Guenevere, get back.
You're beaten, Leondegrance.
Get the hook.
Throw the rope.
That's good.
That's it.
Now round the other side.
Uryens is attacking.
Go on!
Father!
Hold on! Hold on!
Take the knights in the moat.
Hold them off.
I'm going for the ladder.
Father, look.
It's the boy king.
Behind you.
Swear faith to me and you shall have mercy.
I need battle lords such as you.
A noble knight swear faith to a squire?
Never, never!
You are right. I'm not yet a knight.
You, Uryens, will knight me.
Then, as knight to knight,
I can offer you mercy.
What's this?
What's this?
Keep it, Uryens.
In the name of God,
Saint Michael and Saint George...
...I give you the right to bear arms and the power to meet justice.
That duty I will solemnly obey...
...as knight and king.
I never saw this.
Rise, King Arthur.
I am your humble knight...
...and I swear allegiance to the courage in your veins...
...so strong it is...
...its source must be Uther Pendragon.
I doubt you no more.
- It didn't hurt too much, did it?
- No.
I've sewn my father's wounds more than once.
Careful! You'll tear them open.
You'll have to stay still and rest.
How long?
A few days.
Oh, no! What is it?
The stitches.
It's all right.
Come on, come on. Dance.
A king must marry, after all.
So it seems.
I love her. If only she'd be my queen...
Merlin, can you make her love me?
Now, look.
I once stood exposed to the Dragon's breath...
...so a man could lie one night with a woman.
It took me nine moons to recover...
...and all for this lunacy called love...
...this mad distemper, that strikes down both beggar and king.
Never again!
Never!
Who will I marry then?
You can tell me that at least.
What do you see?
Oh, Guenevere.
And a beloved friend who will betray you.
You're not listening. Your heart is not.
Love is deaf as well as blind.
You have a land to quell before you can...
...start all this hair pulling and jumping about.
I've made these only for you.
I've mixed into them things that will heal you, but not too quickly...
...and they'll make you a little sleepy so you can't escape.
What's in them?
It is an ancient mixture...
...soft, unborn grains...
...flavored with rose petals.
The rest is secret.
Looking at the cake is like looking at the future.
Until you have tasted it, what do you really know?
And then, of course, it's too late.
Too late.
We have won battles against armies.
And now one man defeats all my knights.
He's a mighty opponent.
A hard man.
I'll go myself.
The King must not engage in single combat. I'll go again.
No, I will.
Merlin, who is this knight?
Look at him.
So beautiful.
So quick.
Remember...
...there's always something cleverer than yourself.
Move aside. This is the King's road...
...and the knights you joined arms against were his very own.
I await the King himself.
His knights are in need of training.
I am King, and this...
...is Excalibur...
...sword of kings from the dawn of time.
Who are you? What do you seek?
I am Lancelot of the Lake, from across the sea.
And I have yet to find a king worthy of my sword.
That is a wild boast.
You lack a knight's humility.
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.
For I have never met my match in joust or duel.
Move aside!
I will not.
You must retreat...
...or prove your worth in the test of arms under the eyes of God.
Then may He give me the strength to unhorse you...
...and send you with one blow back across the sea.
Then come across, sir.
You joust well, sir.
I offer you another lance.
Yes. Yes. Another lance.
Sword!
Yield, sir.
- I have the advantage.
- I will not.
Fight me, on your horse or on foot, but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me.
I sought only not to harm you.
Your rage has unbalanced you.
You, sir, would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy.
For a stretch of road you could easily ride around.
So be it, to the death.
Excalibur...
...I call...
...on your power.
Merlin, what have I done?
You have broken...
...what could not be broken.
Hope is broken.
My pride broke it.
My rage broke it.
This excellent knight...
...who fought with fairness and grace was meant to win.
I used Excalibur to change that verdict.
I have lost for all time the ancient sword of my fathers...
...whose power was meant to unite all men...
...not to serve the vanity of a single man.
I am nothing.
The Lady of the Lake.
Take it!
Excalibur.
Is it true?
Take it! Quickly!
Thanks be to God, you're alive.
I, the best knight in the world, bested!
This is a great day.
For my search is over, my king.
Make me your champion.
But your life and lands are far from here.
I give up my castle and my lands.
Here is my domain...
...within this metal skin.
And I pledge all that I still own:
Muscle, bone, blood, and the heart that pumps it.
And a great heart it is.
Sir Lancelot, you will be my champion.
We killed every one of them!
Burnt their ships!
Lancelot, how'd you fare in the North?
We spared a few to tell what fate they met at Arthur's hands.
- And you, Uryens?
- Victory!
Lot, and you?
We drove the invaders back into the sea.
Gawain, you?
The East is ours again.
The West is free and with us.
The wars are over!
One land, one king!
Peace!
Stand back!
Be silent.
Be still.
That's it.
And look upon this moment.
Savor it.
Rejoice with great gladness.
Great gladness.
Remember it, always...
...for you are joined by it.
You are one, under the stars.
Remember it well then, this night...
...this great victory...
...so that in the years ahead you can say:
'I was there that night, with Arthur, the King.'
For it is the doom of men that they forget.
Your wisdom has forged this ring.
Hereafter, so that we remember our bonds...
...we shall always come together in a circle...
...to hear and tell of deeds good and brave.
I will build a round table...
...where this fellowship shall meet.
And a hall about the table.
And a castle about the hall.
And I will marry.
And the land will have an heir to wield Excalibur.
Knights of the Round Table.
It's Sir Lancelot.
Lancelot, welcome.
This is a great day.
Everything is prepared.
We'll leave at dawn.
Guenevere...
...here is Arthur's greatest knight come to escort you to the King.
They want me to ask you if...
...any one of them could win your heart.
I'm a fighting man.
I'm sworn to the Quest.
But surely there must be some lady somewhere in the world who inspires you?
There is one.
Who is she?
Oh, go on, tell me.
You.
You're teasing me.
I will love you always.
I will love you as my queen...
...and as the wife of my best friend...
...and while you live...
...I will love no other.
By the blood of Jesus Christ...
...I join you in marriage.
Man to woman.
King to queen.
Arthur to Guenevere.
Don't you know me, Lord Merlin?
Morgana of Cornwall.
You have your father's eyes.
I remember you.
When my brother, Arthur, was born you came and took him away.
And now you leave his wedding.
Because I am a creature like you.
What is the stone that burns?
Sulphur. To mix with mercury.
What is that root?
Mandrake.
The essence of it can prolong the act of love.
And if too much is taken?
Pain and death.
That's it.
Oh, you do know something of the Art.
Do you have the Sight?
Do you see the future?
Sometimes, I dream of things that come to pass.
Look now.
What do you see?
What will be?
I see a castle of silver and gold.
Up there.
That plan is well-known.
You'll have to do better than that.
It is a lonely way, you know.
The way of the necromancer.
Yes, to know too much...
...'lacrimae mundi'...
...the tears of the world.
But the power? The joy?
Moments. Fleeting moments.
I can ease your loneliness.
Let me help you. Teach me.
The days of our kind are numbered.
The one God comes to drive out the many gods.
The spirits of wood and stream...
...grow silent.
It's the way of things. Yes.
It's a time for men and their ways.
Run home to your mother, boy.
Take me with you.
I want to be a knight.
I'll find food for you.
Did you like the rabbit?
Do you know what it means to serve a knight who serves a king?
Jump up.
I'll run.
Listen boy...
...it's more than 20 days from here.
Twenty days! The world's not that big.
What's that?
Camelot, the King's castle.
- Cavalry!
- Lancelot, welcome.
Hey, Lot.
Hey, Lancelot. Great to see you.
Will you train this lad to be my squire?
Who'll give me my armor and sword?
Kitchen knives and greasy spits shall be your weapons, boy.
To the kitchens.
Look!
Staying?
There's a meeting of the Round Table.
No. I can't.
Sorry, old fellow.
What're you doing here?
This is no place for an old man.
I built it, dullard.
- All on your own?
- Yes, and for the likes of you, it seems.
Oh, well, then you can tell me the way to the kitchen.
Follow your nose.
I'm dreaming.
I must be dreaming.
Get away from there, boy.
Lancelot doesn't come, once more.
But we must fill his cup to show our love for him.
Watch Guenevere.
Remember what I told you about them.
Your eyes never leave me, Merlin.
Can't I acknowledge beauty?
Can't you acknowledge love?
Perhaps you ache for what you've never known.
Perhaps you lust for what you cannot have.
Cannot have, but you promised.
Your secrets.
You said you'd show me everything.
I've shown you too much already.
Are you counselor to the King, or to my sister?
At your service, sir.
Then answer me this.
For years peace has reigned in the land.
Crops grow in abundance, there's no want.
Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice.
Tell me, Merlin, have we defeated evil?
It seems we have.
Good and evil, there never is one without the other.
Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?
Always...
...where you never expect it.
Always.
I know where.
Where, Sir Gawain?
I cannot say.
You must speak your heart.
You sit at the Round Table.
Where is this evil?
He's our best and bravest.
Why then is he never here?
Without Lancelot this Table is nothing.
Is there anyone here who doesn't think him a god?
And now to be driven from us by a woman's desire.
In the idleness that comes with peace,
I see that gossip has bred its own evil.
I will forgive your...
...hasty words.
Come.
Drink from Lancelot's cup and partake of his goodness.
You dare accuse the Queen, Gawain?
I do!
I protest my innocence.
Were I not king, I would make you pay with your life for what you've said.
- Will you not champion me?
- I cannot.
I'm your king, and I must be your judge in this.
Lancelot must do it.
He also stands accused.
I decree...
...that at sunrise two days from now...
...the champions will meet, and the truth shall be known.
For by the law of God...
...no knight who is false can win in combat...
...with one who is true.
You are the people I love best in the world.
- Then why can't you defend me?
- The law!
My laws must bind everyone, high and low, or they're not laws at all.
- You are my husband.
- I must be king first.
Before husband?
If need be.
Before love?
Lord, we are innocent...
...but not in our hearts.
To hold her once in my arms,
I would sacrifice everything:
Honor.
Truth. My sacred trust. God...
...save me from myself, purge me of this love...
...so that I can defend her.
I fight against myself.
Oh, God!
My lord, the sun is upon the field.
The queen has no champion.
I demand justice, as is my right.
So it is.
Let me champion the Queen!
Since no knight comes forward,
I demand justice.
Is there not one of you?
Let me through.
Boy, kneel.
In the name of God...
...of Saint Michael...
...and Saint George...
...I make you a knight.
Rise, Sir...
- Perceval.
... Perceval.
Lancelot!
It's my task, Perceval, to prove the queen's innocence.
I yield to your mercy, Lancelot.
The Queen is innocent!
Look at your laws now.
Look what they have done.
- Save him, Merlin.
- He has no will to live.
Bring him back, whatever the cost.
Whatever the cost! Do it!
So be it.
- Will he live?
- Oh, yes.
- Will Guenevere...?
- Yes.
- Merlin, will I ever have a son?
- Yes.
No riddles, nothing but a simple yes?
That frightens me.
But a king should be afraid,
Arthur, always...
...of the enemy waiting everywhere...
...in the corridors of his castle...
...on the deer paths of his forest...
...or in a more tangled forest...
...in here.
Welcome, welcome back.
Take your place again, Lancelot.
My lord.
Look! Sir Lancelot! He's back!
No more going.
They miss the battlefield.
I think we do, too.
We have lost our way, Arthur.
It is not easy for them without the hard teaching of war and quest.
It is only your example, Lancelot, that binds them all.
Which is the greatest quality of knighthood?
Courage? Compassion? Loyalty?
Humility?
What do you say, Merlin?
The greatest?
Well, they blend like the metals we mix to make a good sword.
No poetry. Just a straight answer.
Which is it?
All right, then.
Truth. That's it.
Yes. It must be truth, above all.
When a man lies, he murders some part of the world.
You should know that.
I must take my rest in the forest.
Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?
It is deep.
You'll be sorely missed. Heal yourself...
...and come back.
Do you still have the Sight, Merlin?
Are they together?
Yes.
You warned me of this, all those years ago.
What must I do now, kill them?
I can tell you nothing more.
My days are ended.
The gods of once are gone forever.
It's a time for men.
It's your time, Arthur.
I need you now, more than ever.
No.
This is the moment that you must face at last...
...to be king alone.
And you, old friend?
Will I see you again?
No.
There are other worlds.
This one is done with me.
That's it.
Bat wing. Snake skin.
Is this all you've learned, Morgana?
To deal in potions and petty evil.
And where have your meddling arts brought the world?
To the edge of ruin.
I'm worn thin and threadbare.
I've tried to guide men, or meddled in their affairs...
...as you would have it, for far too long.
The time has come for me to go.
Forgive me. Where are you going?
Whence I came.
Merlin, take me with you.
The Charm of Making, you swore to pass it to me.
You think you're ready?
Are you worthy?
I am.
I am.
Then follow me.
What is this place?
Here, you enter the coils of the Dragon.
Here, my power was born.
Here, all things are possible...
...and all things meet their opposites.
The future?
And the past.
Desire?
And regret.
Knowledge?
And oblivion.
Love?
Oh, yes.
Look.
More.
Show me more.
Show me the Dragon.
Tell me the sacred Charm of Making.
Even though such knowledge would burn...
...and blind you?
Then burn me.
Look into the eyes of the Dragon, and despair.
I destroy you. I consign you to oblivion.
Arthur...
Excalibur, into the spine of the Dragon!
The sword! The land!
Yes, Merlin. That's it.
Set the world to rights.
Call the Dragon.
Mend the sword.
Speak the Charm of Making.
You fool!
You thought you would trap me.
You are trapped yourself, by the same sorcery you used to deceive my mother.
You're nothing.
You're not a god, you're not a man.
I shall find a man and give birth to a god.
The King without a sword!
The land without a king!
Love me.
Love me.
- Guenevere...
- Forget and love me.
I have conceived a son, my king...
...my brother.
I could kill you now, brother.
But I want you to live to see our son be king.
God save us from Morgana.
And save us from her unholy child.
Is he dead?
No, he lives.
A knight...
Help us.
Help us, please.
We're dying. Our children are dying.
Where is the King?
Please, help us!
We must find what was lost.
The Grail...
Only the Grail can restore leaf and flower.
Search the land...
...the labyrinths of the forests...
...to the edge of...
...within.
Only the Grail can redeem us.
Search.
Seek.
Where do we look for it?
Portents...
...signs...
...follow.
The King has spoken.
I will ride forth in the name of that quest.
We will find this grail or die.
Have you found it? The Grail.
It's me, Perceval.
We will never find it.
Gawain!
You seek what Arthur wants?
- That thing they call the Grail?
- I do.
Then follow me.
They were looking for it, too, but they weren't good enough.
Mordred, my lovely, clever boy.
You have crossed the great wasteland.
You are burning with thirst.
Drink.
For ten years and a day you have searched.
Is it so long?
And tell me...
...have you found what you seek?
I have found nothing but sorrow and death.
I never thought to hear laughter again...
...till I saw this boy.
He promised me the Grail.
Is it here?
You have searched too hard.
Take your ease.
Drink, and join with me.
Bors! You're here!
Meliot! You, too.
You are alive.
There is no grail, as these good knights have found.
They serve me instead.
There are many pleasures in the world, many cups to drink from...
...and they shall be yours. Drink.
No!
He's no good, Mother.
Take him to the tree.
No!
There is a grail!
{Y: i}What is the secret of the Grail?
{Y: i}Who does it serve?
Arthur, the secret was in my grasp.
I failed you.
When am I going to be king, Mother?
When the time comes,
I will send you to your father.
You will take what is yours and then you will be king.
No spear. No sword.
No arrow.
No lance. No blade.
No weapon forged by man...
...will harm you whilst you wear this armor.
Any message for your dear brother, my father?
You are my message.
Keep a distance, Mordred.
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
Show yourself.
I cannot give you the land...
...only my love.
That's the only thing of yours I don't want.
The Quest Knights have failed.
They're all dead.
You are dead, too.
I shall come back and take Camelot by force.
Uryens!
Renounce the King and I'll spare your life.
Never!
So be it.
Uryens...
I was afraid to help you.
Perceval, never give up the Quest.
I saw the Grail, Uryens.
It was in my grasp.
I failed.
You are the last of us. Try again.
I am not worthy.
You must... you...
Listen!
Follow.
They call you.
All around is death!
Death everywhere!
All of you will come to death...
...for it is our constant companion through life as we trudge...
...through this weary...
...and tragic scene of the valley of the shadow of death.
Look at the great knight!
Peace and plenty they promised.
But what did they give us instead?
Famine and pestilence.
- Lancelot, is it you?
- And death.
Because of their pride, and because of their sin...
- It's me, Perceval.
... God has left the world.
They made themselves God...
...and Christ has abandoned us.
Lancelot, won't you help us?
Come back to us, Lancelot!
Arthur needs you!
Lancelot!
I can't give up hope, Lancelot.
It's all I have.
{Y: i}What is the secret of the Grail?
{Y: i}Who does it serve?
You, my lord.
{Y: i}Who am I?
You are my lord and king.
You are Arthur.
{Y: i}Have you found the secret...
{Y: i}...that I have lost?
Yes.
You and the land are one.
You and the land are one. Drink.
I am wasting away.
I cannot die and I cannot live.
Drink from the chalice.
You will be reborn and the land with you.
Perceval...
...I didn't know how empty was my soul...
...until it was filled.
Arthur!
Ready my knights for battle.
They will ride with their king once more.
I have lived through others far too long.
Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt.
Mordred bore my sins.
My knights have fought my causes.
Now, my brother...
...I shall be king.
Guards!
Knights!
Squires!
Prepare for battle!
Guenevere...
...accept my forgiveness...
...and put your heart to rest.
We've suffered too long.
I have always loved you, and still love you.
I loved you as king...
...sometimes as husband...
...but one cannot gaze too long at the sun.
Forgive me, my wife, if you can.
I was not born to live a man's life...
...but to be the stuff of future memory.
The fellowship was a brief beginning...
...a fair time that cannot be forgotten.
And because it will not be forgotten...
...that fair time may come again.
Now once more I must ride with my knights...
...to defend what was...
...and the dream of what could be.
I kept it.
I never dared to hope, all these years, that it was in your keeping.
I have often thought...
...that in the hereafter of our lives...
...when I owe no more to the future...
...and can be just a man...
...that we may meet and you will come to me...
...and claim me yours...
...and know that I am your husband.
It is a dream I have.
It is only me and my son.
All other knights of the dukedom have rallied to Mordred.
What's that smoke yonder?
That is Mordred's army.
Then let us camp here tonight, and fight tomorrow.
Merlin...
...if only you were at my side, my old friend, to give me courage.
There are no war tricks that will fool Mordred and Morgana.
More than I ever did, I need you now.
Where are you, Merlin?
If only you could see me...
...wield Excalibur once more.
Arthur...
Where have you been these many years?
- Is it true that Morgana...
- Stories.
You brought me back.
Your love brought me back.
Back to where you are now...
...in the land of dreams.
Are you just a dream?
A dream to some...
...a nightmare to others.
Kay, wake up, my brother.
I was dreaming.
Of Merlin?
Yes. He spoke to me.
I dreamed of him, too.
Merlin lives.
He lives in our dreams now.
He speaks to us from there.
He said I would fight bravely tomorrow.
I have returned, enchantress.
You are beautiful.
Yes.
Magnificent.
Have you used up all the magic you stole from me...
...to keep yourself so young?
Have you any magic left...
...to do battle with Merlin?
Nothing to fear from an old man you vanquished long ago...
...who only wants to see how powerful you've become.
You see, Morgana, you made me into a dream...
...a shadow.
A shadow.
You must be greater than ever I was.
I once released the Dragon's breath...
...so Uther could lie with your mother and beget a king.
It almost destroyed me.
But I expect you could do it quite easily, couldn't you?
I see no mist.
Have your powers faded, too?
The Charm.
That's it.
Use the Charm.
Have you forgotten the Charm of Making?
Use it.
Yes, use it.
That's it.
Oh, good.
Oh, that's grand.
That's better than I ever was.
Careful.
It can damage your beauty.
A fog is rising.
Fog?
That cannot be.
My mother has a sense for such things.
She said there would be no fog.
It will stand against us in battle.
Merlin?
Where are you? Where are you?
Mother?
My dear, sweet boy.
- Where are they?
- Listen.
They won't know how few we are in the fog.
We'll use the old ways.
Speed up horse.
They're attacking from behind us!
- Turn about!
- Look to the rear!
You dogs, move!
- There are too many!
- We can't hold them!
Lancelot, is it you?
- Is it true?
- It is.
Lancelot's with us.
He's back, he's with us.
Oh, my God!
Arthur!
Arthur...
Forgive.
My salvation is to die a Knight of the Round Table.
You are that and much more.
You are its greatest knight...
...you are what is best in men.
It is the old wound, my king.
It has never healed.
Guenevere...
...is she queen again?
She is, Lancelot.
The fog is lifting.
No, Perceval.
Come, Father.
Let us embrace at last.
Perceval...
...take Excalibur.
Find a pool...
...of calm water...
...throw the sword into it...
No.
Obey me, Perceval.
Do it and return.
When you cast it in...
...what did you see?
I saw nothing...
...but the wind on the water.
My king, I couldn't do it.
Excalibur cannot be lost.
- Other men...
- Do as I command.
One day a king will come...
...and the sword will rise again. subbed by rogard synced by quanghuy_1993
There he is.
Make a nice, neat line, and I'll be with you in a minute.
You've got to do something.
Okay, you can come in now.
One at a time, pleas.
Make a nice line, orderly, and be kind. Be nice.
What about my paint job?
Mr. Billings, you're talking about a major improvement.
It would be up to the owner.
Oh, it's always up to the owner.
I have cockroaches.
No, you don'.
In New York, they have cockroaches.
Here we have palmettos, and they're harmless.
My little granddaughter, very placid, very quiet, never talks above a whisper, tiptoes when she walks.
Adorable, no? No.
Look, just for two days while her mother goes to visit her...
Mrs. Davi, rules are rule.
And at grand manor, the rules are no children, no pets, and no unnecessary repairs or expenses.
I'm not asking for unnecessary repairs.
It's an emergency. What can
I tell you, Mrs. Davis?
No children means no children.
If I've heard it once,
I've heard it a million times.
The owner has said they're very cute when they're little, but when they grow up... that saying is for kittens!
I can't believe it!
After all we've meant to each other, you would actually evict me for keeping a parakeet in my room?
Sweetheart, if I let you keep a parakeet,
I'd have to let everybody else keep a parakeet, and this is not a bird sanctuary.
It's an apartment house.
Honey, he's only following rules.
If you want to blame someone,
blame the rotten owne.
He is the rotten owner.
Well, that's all for now, folks.
I have an important appointment outside.
Excuse me.
Mr. Garrone, is that you?
I want to talk to you!
Mr. Garrone!
It's been two months,
and I want my rent or I'm gonna take your apartment, Mr. Garrone!
I want it back!
I want my rent, Mr. Garrone!
Your rent is due.
I'm gonna have to take steps!
Mister, would you cross me?
Out of my way, old LA... aah!

Barney satin, souls manager.
On behalf of Gregory,
Julian,
Veronica,
Paul, and Lance,
and our esteemed chairman, welcome to hell.
But... but I'm not dead.
See? See?
I'm not dead.
No, wait, wait! Wait, wait,
wait, wait! Wait a minute!
No, wait, hold everything!
You're making a terrible mistake.
I don't belong here.
I-I've never done anything.
Maxwell Harvey devlin,
for cheating
in fourth grade spelling test,
for misrepresenting his age
at the local movie house,
prank phone calls,
stealing bubblegum
from the local supermarket,
ditching an ugly blind date...
These are trivial misdemeanors.
I'm aware of that.
This is a new game plan, remember?
Now if you'll just bear with me,
Mr. Chairman, sir.
For fraudulent income tax
deductions...
But everybody does that.
For failing to follow through
on innumerable
real estate promises,
for failing to follow through
on 11 promises of marriage...
But I'm not the marrying kind.
I'm a-a-a perennial bachelor.
For failing to assist
agent hargraves...
Agent hargraves? What?
Who's agent hargraves?
Now look, this is all... this is a mistake!
Look, I've never heard of any agent hargraves before in my life.
Agent hargraves.
That's entrapment!
It's not fair!
Fair?
Are you forgetting where you are?
Max devlin is hereby condemned
to level four.
Level four?
What's level four?
It's horrible. Horrible.
You're gonna send me someplace horrible?
Unless... unless... unless what? What?!
Well, let's say that we conditionally restore you to life on earth, say for a period of, mmm, two months.
In that time, if you could find three souls to take your place, you sign them.
Then, if you don't, hmm...
Let me see.
There's Joe basuti.
He's our slum landlord.
And there's a doctor I know who's deeply into medicaid fraud.
And oh, yeah, a hit man I know in venice.
No good.
No, no, no, it's not venice, Italy.
It's venice, right here in California.
No good.
Sooner or later, we'll get those people anyway.
What did he say?
It's no good.
We get these peoples anyways.
Mr. Devlin, what we're looking for is fresh, unsullied innocence.
Oh.
I don't think I know too many people like that.
Actually,
I don't think I know any.
Where do I find them?
They're all over, unfortunately.
To facilitate matters, let's start with your area.
Unsullied innocence.
Get the.
You want me to corrupt the souls of little kids?
See, I've never been much on kids.
But that's not a nice thing.
Neither is level four.
Where do I sign?
What's going on here?
Y-y-you just got killed by this bus.
You're out of your mind.
Mind if I join you?
Do I know you?
D'you live around here?
I mean... I mean, you look very familiar.
My God.
What'll it be?
Just give me a second.
Wait a minute.
I said,
"just give me a second."
Wait a minute.
This is crazy.
I don't know you.
I dreamed you.
It was no dream, Max.
What's going on here?
How do you know my name?
I know everything about you, Max.
Well, you wanna order or not?
Uh, I'll have another black coffee.
Hey, wait a minute.
What about my friend here?
Your friend?
Yeah, yeah. My friend.
Okay, two coffees.
One for your friend.
He can't see me, Max.
What are you talking about?
Only you can see me.
You crazy.
You crazy, you know that?
You must have just escaped from the funny house.
Two coffees.
One for your friend.
Hey, do you know this gu?
Yeah, yeah. I seen him around.
That's what I thought.
All right, now, look, you make sure to pick up the tab.
You see,
I don't trust your friend.
He's putting you on.
He can't see me.
You're crazy! You're crazy!
You know... hey, Mac!
Mac, he tells me you can't see him.
Look, buddy, why don't you take your friend and leave.
I don't want to have to call the cops.
Cops?
He's gonna call the cops now.
Everybody's crazy around here.
I'm getting out of here.
Hey, hey, hey, that's $1.05 for three coffees.
Don't worry. I'm paying.
All right. Let's have it.
Okay, budd.
Let's have I.
Listen. A weird thing... a weird thing just happened.
There's this mirror behind the cashier.
You're one of us now.
Inhabitants of hell cast no reflection.
You remember this.
Oh, my God.
I wish you wouldn't say that.
I'm sorry. Yeah.
It's true.
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it. Why me?
I'm young.
I wasn't any worse than the next guy.
I mean,
I wasn't all bad, was I?
It's not fair.
Where were you when I needed you?
Yeah, well, you can't blame him.
I mean, you did it all yourself.
Now is there someplace less public we could... we have things to discuss because time's wasting.
All right, now, you... you okay?
Now, look, let's synchronize our watches.
What time do you have?
Who cares? I'm dead.
No, cheer up now.
You have midnight, may 15th.
I want signed contracts of the three kids.
Okay.
For starters, who are they?
What are their names?
How am I gonna meet 'em?
Concentrate.
Concentrate?
Concentrate.
Like the girl.
She's your target.
Concentrate.
Like that?
Yeah.
Yeah? Yes.
This is phenomenal.
Wow. It's like I got esp or something.
I got her. I got her.
I can see her.
It's a little hazy...
Well, what do you want for the first time out?
Why, this is amazing.
Hey, how can I be there?
How do you do that?
Same technique.
You concentrate harder.
Literally think yourself there.
I hate the way I look.
No, no, you look great.
I look terrible.
No, you should see the back.
I look terrible.
I can't get the back.
I can't see anything.
Stella, you're gonna e
terrific tonigh.
Yeah, sure.
Oh, my God.
What are you doing in here?
It's quite all right. I-I'm...
I'm very... I'm not really here.
Excuse me.
Oh, well, come... come in... it's...
Kinky.
Oh, yeah, boy.
Barney!
In the ladies' room.
For God's s... please.
In the ladies' room.
Next time, you look before you... leap. Right.
Next time, I look before I leap.
Now... oh!
Now, from now on, this, in order to concentrate... but I thought... it's not necessary.
Okay?
One of the most valuable of your newly-acquired gifts is to confer magic properties, you see.
Now to do that, all you have to do is command your target to perform.
Perform what?
Whatever.
Oh. Yeah.
The air conditioner's
one the Fritz again, and it's hotter than hell up here.
Ha!
He doesn't know how hot it is.
Max, you better get my screen fixed, those palmettos are coming in the windows.
They're all over the place.
Max, Max, I don't have
hot or cold water.
I'm over here.
Please be an angel and fix it.
What am I gonna do?
I can't wash... magic property lasts only so long as you and the target are within sight of each other.
What happens to the kids after they sign?
Nothing.
We don't get them till the natural ends of their lives.
Hey, isn't that the head a & off
of blizzard records?
Ah, man.
What I wouldn't give not to mess up now.
You won't. You won't.
What do you know?
Hey, that's the guy from the John.
Hey, don't come near me, pal.
You lay a hand on me, and I'll scream.
Oh, I'm genuinely sorry about what happened in the bathroom.
It was an honest mistake.
I just walked through the wrong door.
He doesn't seem like a pervert, Heidi.
Thank you very much. I'm not.
But I am very good luck.
And I guarantee, you will not fail tonight.
You're gonna do all right.
Now go get 'em, Stella.
All right, now, to sing her own material, this is her first time now, folks, so let's have a warm welcome for miss Stella summers.
Come on.
Hi.
In, um, in topanga canyon, uh, where I come from, the living... the living's real easy
'cause everybody's folks
kinda let them do
their own thing,
which is why I'm glad
I come from there.
Um, so what I'd like to do right now is sing to you a tune that I...
I wrote this tune.
And I'd like to dedicate it to all the kids around the country who don't have it so good.
Whoo!
¶ Oh, it's so hard ¶
¶ saying... ¶
¶ What I need in here ¶
¶ When I know it means ¶
¶ There's no you ¶

Stella summers.
Just stick with me, kid.
Excuse me. Yeah?
Jerry nadler, a & r, blizzard records.
Listen, sweetheart, that was sheer dynamite.
You got anything on tape? No.
All right, listen, what I want you to do is come into the place, any time that's convenient for you we'll lay something down, okay?
Yeah. How about next week?
Yeah. Oh!
Can he come? Can he come?
Why, what is he?
Your manager or what?
She needs me.
Come on. They want you!
Who are you?
I'm her, uh, groupie.
Great.
Great.
Nelson, darling, it's 1:00 in the morning.
What's keeping you up so late?
Uh, the ucla law review.
It's fascinating.
Oh. That's nice, dear.
Well, good night.
Good night.
Come on. Forget about him.
Ah, come on.
Just one quick lesson.
Just forget it, nerd.
Why?
Because nerds don't do dangerous stuff.
Suppose you fell off the bike?
Your daddy'd sue us.
I'll sign a waiver.
Forget it.
Oh!
Uh, do you take beginners?
Depends on how badly you wanna learn.
What? What?
I said, it depends on how badly you wanna learn.
Oh, a lot.
Because I wouldn't want to divulge my expertise to just anyone.
You've got to want it so bad,
I mean, so bad that you'd sell your soul for it.
Well, I'm your man.
I mean, you know, it's such a wild coincidence you just coming along like that.
Hop in.
Max devlin.
Nelson nordlinger.
How do you do?
Nice meeting you, Nelson.
Oh, in school,
they just call me nerd.
Insensitive bums.
Aren't you gonna show me how
first?
Nah, learning by doing...
that's my motto.
Come on.
Get on, and take her away.
Well, Mr. Devlin, you know, the worst thing about being the nerd is just that you begin to believe the litany of disaster you were brought up on.
To put it bluntly,
I'm scared to get on this thing.
Of course you are.
I can understand that.
But Sonny boy, I'm not your run-of-the-mill trainer.
I have wrought miracles in my day.
You ever heard of Roger decoster?
You taught Roger decoster?
By the time I'm finished with you, you're gonna make Roger decoster look like molasses.
You're gonna be the motocross champ of the world.
Now come on.
Miracle Max says step on the starter.
Miracle Max says you're gonna ride all over this hill, and what's more, you're gonna like it.
Try.
Just thought I'd remind you that the magic property lasts only as long as you and the subject are within sight of each other.
Hey, come back!
You all right?
Yeah.
You did pretty good, considering the hunk of junk you was riding on.
Well, that's not my hunk of junk.
It belongs to my trainer.
It does?
What kind of trainer's learning you on a rattly trap ol' thing like that?
Oh, well, so long
as it runs, I guess.
Hey, I'll tell you what, you come on out
I'd be glad to race against you proper.
Big Billy hunniker's the moniker.
Nerve nordlinger.
Nerve with a "v."
Be seeing you now.
You stupid, dumb idiot!
It's a miracle you weren't killed.
Look, when I said over the hill,
I didn't mean literally over the hill.
Now let me tell you something.
How you choose to endanger your life in your spare time is beyond my control.
But when you're riding this bike,
I never want you
out of my sight.
Ever! Is that clear?
Now let's cruise, easy and nice, back to the car.
Yeah.
Okay.
Four.
Next. I'll take one.
Sorry.
No children under 12 are permitted without an adult.
He's with me.
I'm his Uncle Max.
Make that two, please?
Yeah. Two.
Thank you very much.
Next.
By the way, whose the Uncle Max am I?
Toby's.
Toby who?
Toby hart, and thanks a lot for helping me.
My pleasure.
Well, I'll see ya, Uncle Max.
Thanks again.
What do you mean, you'll see me?
I thought you were having such a great time?
Uh, I am, but I ran out of money, so.
What are you worried about?
I got plenty of money.
The next one's on me.
Really? Sure.
I figure we spend some time together, get to know one another.
I'll find out the kind of things you like, you'll find out the kind of things I like.
For instance, Toby, if you could have anything in the whole world, what would it be?
To do the octopus again.
Well, that's not exactly what I had in mind.
Don't you like the octopus?
Better than life itself, but what I thought was that if you and me got our heads together...
Okay, so you don't want to be the best pitcher in your class.
And you don't want to be the strongest kid in the world.
And you don't want to be the lead soprano in the vienna boys' choir.
Then what do you want to be?
Hey, I got it, I got it.
I got it. Invisible!
If you were invisible, you could come here all the time and ride the rides for free.
Wouldn't that be great?
Wait.
But wouldn't that be cheating?
Yeah. You're right.
You wouldn't want to cheat.
Well, Toby, old pal, old sport,
isn't there something
you want that's so big and so terrific and so important that you'd... well, you'd practically sell your soul for?
Hmm.
Well, there is one thing.
What? To have you for my father.
Well, what's the matter with your own father?
Dead.
Oh.
Say, if you were my father,
I can go to the carnival for free any time I want anyways.
'Cause you'd bring me.
It's only a couple blocks from the house.
I live right over here.
Come on.
Oh. Okay.
I mean, how do you know your mother would want to marry me?
She will.
Why wouldn't she?
Are those all your little brothers and sisters
and thing?
Nah, they're pat
of mom's daycare cente, which you'd be helping her with.
Ah.
Oh, and that's mom over there.
She's a neat lady
most of the time.
There.
Okay.
Hi, mom.
Toby.
Mr. Max devlin.
Penny har. Tad.
How come you're so late and you're so dirty?
And I asked you not to waste your money in that place again.
Uncle Max paid.
Uncle Max.
He's okay.
I found out all about him.
He's in real estate,
38 years old, not married, and loves little kids.
Oh, I'll bet.
Listen, Toby,
I am not getting married again for a good long time.
If ever.
So stop matchmaking.
One of these days, you're gonna drag home a murderer.
This is probably the day.
Oh, mom, he's nice.
Look at him.
The name of this game
is names.
I'm Max.
I'm tremaine.
Goo.
I'm Sean.
Sean.
I'm christiana.
Oh. Christiana.
Stella.
Yeah? Let's try it again, okay?
Okay, yeah.
I'll do good this time.
Roll music.
Roll playback.
Take 41.
¶ Oh, it's so hard ¶
¶ just saying what I need ¶
¶ when... ¶
I'm sorry.
I can't. I'm sorry.
I'm blowing it.
Take five, Stella.
We'll come back to it in a minute.
Cut it.
I'm kati.
How do you do?
I'm moe. Moe.
I'm... I'm Marie.
Oh my goodness.
Julata. Joy.
Stella!
Stella?
You've got to use your hand...
Toby, watch that man.
I don't want him left alone with those kids for two seconds.
He looks thoroughly unreliable.
Hello?
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
I can't talk right now.
I'm really busy.
Max? Max?
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
Max!
Okay, good. Thanks.
Buh-bye.
Mom. I told you not to leave him alone with them.
I didn't.
He left them alone.
Just what I thought.
Thoroughly unreliable.
Max!
Max?
Max! Max!
¶ oh, it's so hard ¶
I'm sorry. I can't.
- Yes, you can.
- Stop the music.
Where'd he come from?
I don't know.
Listen, Max, we've done it
42 times alread.
Yeah, but you didn't do it
42 times with me here, okay.
Stella. Yeah?
Let's give 'em a perfect take, okay?
Okay. All right. Okay, guys, start the music.
Start the music.
Roll playback.
Take 43.
¶ Oh, it's so hard ¶
¶ saying what I need ¶
¶ when I know that it means ¶
¶ there's no you ¶
¶ I've never loved ¶
¶ and been so sure of it ¶
¶ now I guess we both have to choose ¶ what happened?
¶ Oh, you say friends, and I say that's not enough ¶
¶ give it up ¶
¶ oh, I say love is, but it is just too much ¶
¶ for you to touch ¶
¶ oh-ohh ¶
¶ I should say good-bye ¶
¶ any fool could see ¶
¶ you say friends ¶
¶ and I say it's not enough ¶ promised to sign every album you buy here today.
You won't believe this.
Stella, look.
Number 28.
It's climbing.
Hello?
Hello, Toby.
This is your Uncle Max.
Oh, hi.
Can I talk to your mother, please?
Uh, just a sec, all right?
It's for you, mom.
It's Uncle Max.
Uncle Max?
I don't believe it.
Tell him that I'm... tell him that I'm not here.
She says to say she's not here.
Huh... well, you tell her it's somebody else.
I have to talk to her.
He says to say he's someone else.
Excuse me, guys.
Hello. Uncle Max?
Uh, I don't know who you are or what you want, but I want you to leave me and my son alone, please.
Mrs. Hart, don't hang up on me, please, until you hear me out, okay?
You may think this sounds insane, but I've fallen deeply in love...
You know what you are?
You are the only 11-year-old procurer in the business.
What's a...?
Forget it.
Great party, Jerry.
Great.
My sources tell me
that the record deal.
Stella's manager
negotiated for her
is well up there
in the six figures, which makes Stella a very lucky little girl.
And what percentage of the six-figure deal is lucky little maxy going to get?
So, uh, where's your girlfriend, Heidi?
Parents wouldn't let her come.
They're such a pain.
Well, your parents are okay, aren't they?
They're alive. Sure.
In topanga canyon, though, it's different, you know.
The parents don't care where you go or who you go with or what kind of music you play.
You know.
I mean, maxy, I am really lucky.
I mean, there are some parents, they are so strict.
They don't allow anything but classical around the house.
And they don't even own a TV.
Having a swell time, aren't we?
Yeah, this is great.
I hope this lasts forever.
I bet you'd be willing to sell your soul for that.
Ha! If I had a soul to sell.
Would you care to put that on paper?
'Cause I'm the guy who can arrange it.
Remember me. Miracle Max.
Right now, I'd sell my soul
for a cheeseburger.
Well, that too can be arranged.
Just put your little
John hancock right there and we'll fill the details in later.
Max, you know, you're really off the wall tonight.
Here, hold this.
I want to talk to Jerry.
Oh, eat first and corrupt later.
That's what I always say.
How much later are you planning to wait?
It's already April 10th.
Well, look at her.
She's as good as in the bag.
As good as is not good enough.
Now what about the others?
Oh, don't worry.
I'm working on it.
Nakaguchi's been running very well here.
Certainly competitive here on the cross of a warm afternoon.
We have a little boy with a red shirt and green pants.
He's here in the announcer stand.
His parents are lost.
A little boy with a red shirt...
What category?
Expert.
I'm not so sure about that.
I'm sure.
If you're in the first race, you should be at the starting line.
Get your bikes to the starting line, please.
Hey, man.
Hey, I don't want you to get excited now.
I'm not excited.
Oh, oh, my God.
Don't turn around.
There are two nakaguchi scouts
sitting right there in the bleachers.
Well shut my mouth.
Don't turn around.
Look, I know why they're here too.
They're looking for factory riders, and if you go out there and win, they're gonna make you one,
I just know it.
Honey, they will. They will.
I want you to go out and do your best, Billy, okay?
Laverne, honey, don't I always?
Yeah.
Now if you are at the first moto...
How about a few last minute pointers?
What for?
You've been over this track a million times in the last few weeks.
Yeah, but never in a race.
It's very simple.
You start, you ride like a bat out of hell, and you win.
Have you ever seen one of our bats?
Uh, scratch that.
You start, and you win.
Okay, I'll be waiting over there.
...Starting line.
Start looking 'em over.
30 seconds.
Field is on the starting line.
They're all lined up.
About to start.
Starter has his hand in the air.
And there they go!
...good start going into the first turn.
And over the hill, number 19 making a big move.
Typical ride there by Ralph hanson.
And big Billy hunniker.
And number one and 19, they are going handlebar to handlebar.
What a race.
And 19 has taken the lead.
Hunniker is running second.
Big Billy with number one, was a national champion on his plate.
He's having problems catching the newcomer.
There's a medal back there.
God, that number 19.
He's out of sight.
No, he isn't.
He's right over there.
Here they come.
Who is he anyway?
I don't know, but big Billy's gonna take him in the final.
How do you know he's gonna?
'Cause he happens to be the best amateur rider in the country, dummy.
Here they come around.
19's still in the lead.
Coming down towards the checkered flag.
And number 19 wins it.
Nerd. Nerd won it.
Number 19. Nordlinger.
Wow, you were wonderful.
Hey, does everybody here know my good buddy, big Billy hunniker?
And Mrs. Big Billy hunniker.
Well, they do now.
Nice form, boy. Wow.
You were great.
Beats the hell out of me how you done it, though.
Yeah, come on, nerd. Tell us.
How'd you do it?
How did you do it?
Tell me.
Well, I-I just... don't go away.
I'll be right back, okay?
Wonderful.
Max?
Listen, kid.
This is the first of a lot of wins for you, so a word of advice.
When someone asks you how you did it, just say,
"that's my little secret."
Okay.
But how... how did I do it?
That's my little secret.
Just don't ever do it without me.
Hi.
It's only dear old dads.
You wish.
Well, it's not my wish.
It's your wish.
But since your very wish is my command,
I'm gonna give it one more try.
Toby, you think your mother's gonna be home tonight, by any chance?
Yeah, but not to you, I bet.
Why?
Well, it's very discouraging.
Now she'll probably end up marrying boring Larry binder.
What's a boring Larry binder?
Um, my mom's tennis teacher.
You mean
I'm not the only contender?
Gee, if it's just any old father you'd sell your soul for...
Well, it isn't.
Your my first choice.
That's a relief.
Toby, do you think you could keep your mother really busy for the rest of the day?
Why?
Just trust me, okay?
Okay? Okay. Okay.
Weird about two things.
The way they come and go.
Oh, it's weird, all right.
Three hours and $25 later.
Sorry.
It just suddenly got better again.
I'm sorry.
You must have the wrong house.
I didn't authorize any of this.
Penny hart, 1723 Tobias street?
I hope you're not mad at me.
I don't understand.
Well, I wanted to do something really nice so you wouldn't think
I was such a terrible guy.
Well, you didn't have to go through all this trouble.
I can't accept this.
Oh, please. The kids'll really enjoy the equipment.
And it's gonna make me feel very warm inside.
Look, mom, grass, so we don't have to sit in the dirt anymore.
I'm really very touched.
Of course, I've completely depleted my savings account, but Toby and tremaine and consuela are wonderful people.
And oh, what the heck.
So between managing the nordlinger boy and Stella,
I'm perpetually on the run, as you can imagine.
I don't have to imagine.
I can tell by looking at you.
Don't you ever look in the mirror when you shave?
Not if I can help it.
Take tonight.
Tonight's a perfect example of what I'm talking about.
Stand free. Who needs it?
Believe me, penn.
My life isn't my ow.
And on top of everything else is my real estate responsibilities, which are considerable.
Some landlords will allow a place to go to hell in a trash can, but not me.
Constant repairs, constant maintenance, constant outlays of time and money.
I'll bet.
And then there's the little old ladies who insist on keeping their pets and the young, married couples who insist on keeping their kids.
Not that I've got anything against kids.
But some landlords feel it's rough enough taking care of a place these days without them thumping and bumping around, and playing handball on your walls at all hours, and putting their mangy little hands on your fresh paint.
Plus, the whining and the wailing all night.
And at the crack of dawn in the morning before you've had your coffee, they'll ring your bell with the most insipid, stupid questions that you never have an answer to.
It could drive you nuts.
Is that how you really feel about kids?
Well, sometimes.
Me too.
Sometimes.
Everybody in the granite lounge at 10:45 am sharp, and that means sharp.
We've got a heavy body count.
And, Stella, I still don't know if the number one groupie is coming or not.
Her parents won't let her.
What do you need her for?
Companionship.
Don't worry about it, sweetheart.
I'll find somebody for you.
Keep you company.
Somebody you can rap with. Dig?
Wait a second.
Max is coming, right?
Right.
Aha. Speak of the devil.
Greg weems, I want you to meet
Max devlin.
The svengali manager.
Now him you gotta take very good care of because this dippy chick doesn't sing a note unless he's practically in her pocket.
Hey-hey, right on, eh?
Stella, you're on.
Come here.
Listen to me, carefully. Yeah.
I'm going out front to watch you from there.
With that crowd, timing is everything.
So don't start to sing until I give you the cue from the audience.
Is that clear?
Okay. It's clear.
Great.
Wish me luck.
Okay, here's what you've been
waiting for.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Stella summers.
Come on, Stella!
Okay, Stella!
Knock 'em in the aisles!
¶ Oh, it's so hard ¶
¶ saying what I need ¶
¶ when I know that it means ¶
¶ there's no you ¶
¶ I've never loved ¶
¶ and been so sure of it ¶
¶ now I know we both have to choose ¶
¶ oh, you say friends, and I say that's not enough ¶
¶ give it up ¶
¶ oh, I say love is, but it is just too much ¶
¶ for you to touch ¶
¶ oh-ohh ¶ bye. Bye.
Max.
Thank you.
What's wrong, pal?
No good without your coach, huh?
Can't start it. Want some help?
What's the proble? Huh, bu?
Come o. Kick it over, pa.
Start it up.
Come on. Get it started.
Wel.
Come on!
We gotta take you.
¶ Oh, you say friends, and I say that's not enough ¶
¶ give it up ¶
¶ oh, I say love is but it's not enough ¶
Max!
Max!
¶ For you to touch ¶
¶ oh-ohh ¶ hey, you, get your hands off that rope.
¶ Any fool could see ¶ what did you do that for?
What are you, crazy?
I-I was just trying to save your life.
Save my life?
What, by killing me?
You're crazy.
Oh, now I'm sorry,
Jerry, really.
Just don't... don't touch me.
You, it's all your fault.
Gosh, Jerry, I'm all wound u.
I'm sorr.
Tense.
I gotta go and relax in the men's room.
Barney, Barney, you son of a... where are you?
There you are, you obnoxious... oh, I'm... oh, sorry.
Hey, hey, it's okay.
We're all show business here, you know.
That's right.
You harboring some kind of death wish, Max?
No, but you are.
You're lucky you're dead, man, or so help me,
you would be.
You're getting angry, Max.
You're darn right I am.
Don't you ever, ever try a stunt like that on me again.
Just trying to get your attention.
Well, next time, try tapping me on the shoulder.
What about my contracts?
So that's what this is all about.
Yes. My associates are getting a little itchy.
I don't care.
I got until midnight, may 15th.
That's our deal.
I'm telling you,
I'm trying to get these people so hooked on me, they'll sign anything.
That takes time.
Now if I go too fast, I'm liable to blow the whole deal.
I like your style, Max.
You're a devious fellow.
Who's that?
Oh, hi, maxy. Come in.
What's that? Let me see.
"Gentlemen, I hereby engage you to be
"my sole personal manager for an indefinite period..."
And stuff and stuff...
Hey, what is this?
Well, now that you'e
such a big hi,
I thought that it would be a good idea for us to enter into a business-like arrangement.
That's all.
Well, we have a business-like arrangement.
I mean, you get 20% of everything I make.
Isn't that business-like?
But we don't have anything officially on paper.
Eh, it doesn't matter.
You get the bread anyhow.
What difference does it make?
Stella, suppose I decided not to show up some time and without my miracle, you couldn't sing.
Well, I don't know.
Then you get 20% of nothing.
I mean, why would you do a dumb thing like that?
Listen, how'd you find us?
There must be a hundred million people here.
Well, I told you this morning.
Intuition.
Yeah, well, I wish your intuition told you to bring your swimming trunks.
We coulda gone in.
Well, I'm still glad you came anyways.
I missed ya.
Well, it's the first day off we've had in quite some time.
Yeah, well, my mom missed you too.
Yeah?
So you still want me to be your dad, huh?
Yeah. Don't you wanna be?
Well, of course I do,
Toby, you know that.
But a guy like me's gotta think pretty carefully before he gives up his freedom and takes on the responsibility of a family.
So on and so forth.
I mean, it's, like, you're gonna get me for a father, but what am I gonna get from you?
I don't know. What do you want?
Well, what do you got?
Um, some baseball cards, a cassette deck... it doesn't work too good, but...
Never mind, keep going.
I think we can come to an agreement here.
Okay, let me think.
Uh, I got a guinness book
of world records.
Wow, that's great.
Um, let me see, a rock collection...
I always wanted one of those.
Um, a real pair of handcuffs with the key...
Oh, a key.
Um, let me think,
I got some more stuff.
Yeah.
A rubber-coated hard ball...
Oh, wow. Um, one more. Wait.
Oh, yeah, and two packs of red hots.
You know, those are those little cinnamon candies.
Oh, yummy, yeah, yeah.
That's enough, enough.
Okay, now listen, how does this sound?
"I, the undersigned..." that's you.
"Agree to surrender my card collection,
"my cassette deck, my soul,
"my guinness book of world records,
"two packages of red hots, in return for which..."
I'll marry your mom, and I'll be your dad, okay?
Here, now sign here.
Right there.
Tricky.
Thanks.
You didn't put your part yet.
No flies on him either.
"Marry mom..."
Now will you sign?
Sure.
As soon as you marry my mother.
He has potential.
Six weeks ago, you were nowhere on this planet.
And now look at you.
King of the castle among your peers and peerless among your competitors.
Thanks to me.
Thanks to you is right, Max.
No, no, don't get me wrong now.
I'm not looking for your thanks.
Thanks aren't important.
It's your loyalty.
Your loyalty is what's important.
You have that.
Yeah, well, you say that now, but you'll forgive a touch of the cynic.
I've seen it happen time and again.
An older guy like me gives his all to a young punk like you.
Good faith on both sides, you understand.
And when the kid makes it to the top, well, because there was nothing legally binding
between 'em...
Max, you got something for me to sign,
I'll be more than happy to sign it.
Now, Max, now.
Get lost.
Hmm?
I was just saying how easy it would be to get lost in a big crowd like this.
Here. It's a standard trainer-rider agreement.
Sign right here.
Max, sole is spelled s-o-l-e, not s-o-u-l.
Well, Max, you just blew it again.
Okay, hold onto this!
Is that how you really feel about children?
Ah, well, you know, sometimes.
Yeah, I know. Sometimes.
Hold on.
Max, everybody's having a wonderful time.
Yeah, well, that makes me feel really happy.
You could stay as long as you want to.
Where are you going?
They extended the concert tour for another day so I gotta leave now.
But Toby will be crushed.
And what about dinner?
I don't know why
I put up with you.
Since I'm such a good kisser.
That so, huh?
Where is he going?
Bad news. He has to leave.
But... but now?
He promised to take me to the carnival right after swimming.
I know. I know.
He promised!
Now you see him, now you don't.
What good of a person is that?
That's that.
19 cities in 21 days and a knockout every time.
You're wonderful.
"Every night
I make love to 25,000 people.
And then I go home alone."
Janis joplin, 1970.
Stella summers,
1981.
Hey, maxy, would you do me a favor?
Lend me a dime?
And I'm gonna be alone, okay?
Operator?
This is collect to anybody who'll answer.
I'm Stephanie pepper.
The number you have reached is not in service at this time.
Ah, where are you?
Please make sure you have dialed correctly.
This is a recording.
Stephanie pepper?
What's the matter?
Homesick for topanga canyon?
No.
Borough park, Brooklyn.
Nice middle class family in New York.
And nothing but classical music at home and no TV.
Right.
Plus, every time I said
I wanna become a star, they'd say that's no kind of life for anybody to lead.
My parents are so square.
They were right about that, you know.
I-I don't know.
I guess they didn't want
to see me get hurt.
Yeah.
I mean, they probably didn't think
I was good enough to make it, you know.
But I always had this funny feeling...
That I was.
That I could.
And I did.
Not without me.
I know, maxy, I know.
And I'm really grateful to you, I am.
Now's the time, Max.
I'm not so sure
I did you any favors.
Look, Uncle Max!
Uncle Max!
Hi! Hi.
Listen, I've got to see Toby.
Hi, children.
No!
Oh, yeah, you're going to play.
Go and play rhythm, rhythm.
Or play hide and seek, and wolf will be it.
Come on.
Okay, Marie.
I got here as soon as possible.
Yeah? What for?
Well, I'm ready to propose to your mother.
Where is she?
Inside, but don't bother.
The deal's off.
Come here.
Look, you can keep the rock collection and the handcuffs.
And forget about the red hots.
I never really cared for them anyway.
That part of the deal isn't what bothers me.
Well, what part does?
The you part.
I think I'd rather have binder.
You're not so reliable.
Well, you're a fine one to talk, Toby.
If you don't want e
for a fathe, then how am I gonna marry your mother?
Which is something
I really want to do.
Very simple.
Just ask me.
I think it's my decision, not his, isn't it?
Don't you want a father who's gonna make your mother very happy?
Binder's better.
You can count on him.
Toby, binder is boring.
Binder took me to the carnival Sunday.
Yeah, and how was it?
Boring.
Toby, when your mother and I are married, you'll be able to count on me too.
I promise.
Okay, but since you don't like the red hots, well, I guess
I'll keep 'em anyway.
That's fair.
Mind if I join you?
What are you doing here?
I've never been to the grammys.
Be my guest.
Goody for me.
Goody for you too.
Congratulations on your engagement.
When's the happy day?
Saturday.
Sandwiched in between the first and second motos.
And after that,
Stella's concert at the music center.
Well, it's gonna be very busy.
The 15th?
You're cutting it a little close, aren't you?
I had no choice in the matter.
It was her decision.
Well, at least you'll have saved yourself.
Yeah.
You don't look too happy about it.
Nobody said I had to enjoy it.
Beats level four.
But your hair looks nice.
Thank you.
Jerry!
Get me away from them!
Get me away from them!
I want them away from me!
And the winner is...
Any fool could see,
Stella summers.
Thank you.
Winning this grammy is a great honor.
And to those who are not up here with me now to share it with me,
Max devlin, my manager,
Jerry nadler of blizzard,
I have only this to say.
It was a long, hard pull, man.
And I've got nobody to thank but myself.
My God, she's a monster.
She's fabulous, sweetheart.
It's just the way we like 'em.
One down, two to go.
Come on. Fast, fast.
This is a specialty precaution indemnification thing in case of an accident, duh-duh-duh-duh...
I, the undersigned, declare that my trainer,
Max devlin, duh-duh-duh-duh-duh...
Will take sole responsibility for me.
Uh, here, now you sign it.
Isn't it a little late in the game for this, Max?
Well, better late than never.
Come on. Sign it.
Max, your spelling is atrocious.
I told you, "sole" is s-o-l-e.
Sign it now.
I'll correct it later.
Yeah. All right.
Ladders coming into the positions now for the feature event of the afternoon.
Fans waiting to see if nerve nordlinger can keep his streak intact.
Most of the fans are here to watch the rematch between nordlinger and hunniker.
And there they go. They're off.
Feature race of the afternoon.
And immediately, number one, big Billy hunniker, along with nerve nordlinger, and number nine Tracy also in there.
A three-way race for the lead.
Just make it fast and safe.
Why bother with safe?
You already have him down on paper.
'Cause I don't want him to kill himself.
And they're coming down that hill in good shape.
Looks like somebody there had a primary chain lock up on him.
Here comes hunniker on the inside.
Oh, it's hunniker.
Two down and one to go.
I didn't think it was gonna be like that.
What did you expect?
I don't know.
I wasn't thinking.
Beloved family and friends,
we are gathered here
to join this man and this woman
in the bonds of holy matrimon.
If there's anyone present
who can show just cause
why they should not be joined,
let him speak now
or forever after
hold his peace.
What a... who invited you?
I'm the maid of honor.
Do you, Maxwell devlin,
take Penelope hart
to be
your lawfully-wedded wife,
to love, to honor,
and to cherish
till death do you part?
I do.
Do you, Penelope hart, take.
Maxwell devlin to be
your lawfully-wedded husband,
to love, to honor,
and to cherish
till death do you part?
I do.
By the power vested in me by the laws of the state of California,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
Beth henrietta!
Hello!
Well, son, did you forget about your agreement with dear, old dad?
But I get to keep the red hots, okay?
Well... Okay.
Mom, I gotta talk to you for a second.
Sure, what?
Over here.
Excuse me.
Toby, what is so important that you had to drag me away from everybody?
It's something about Max.
I don't know what it is, but I just don't seem to like him anymore.
You're just jealous.
It's natural, of course.
No, it's something really weird and bad about Max.
In fact, I hate Max!
Shh.
You should have thought of that before.
Now shape up. Go play.
Some swell marriage we're gonna have if he hates me.
He'll be impossible to live with.
You don't have to worry about that.
Slightest hint to agent hargraves, and it's all over.
Wanna synchronize your watch?
They all signed.
I'm free.
Aren't I?
Yes, you are.
But by midnight, they belong to me.
Not until the natural end of their lives, that's what you said.
Point of fact... I lied.
I need them now.
Oh, no, Barney. Please.
I couldn't have done it if I'd known that.
He's a great kid.
They're all great kids.
But that kid... kill him, and you kill her!
Unfortunately, her soul does not belong to me.
You win some, you lose some.
But then again, you have
your precious life.
Okay, Barney.
I know you're here.
Let me see your rotten, lying, deceitful face now when I burn your contracts.
Burn those contracts, and eternal damnation is yours.
You'll know the unmitigating
pain and horror of limbs being torn from their sockets... your limbs, your sockets!
You'll feel pain you never imagined in life.
Yours. Forever.
Flesh you'll smell burning.
Your flesh rotting.
Forever.
You'll never get these kids.
Never.
Max.
Max.
Max?
Are you all right?
I have to go now.
Max, it's our wedding day.
There are people who need me.
I promise to come back as soon as I can.
Max.
Well, anyways, to answer your question, big Billy hunniker is not only a sweetheart of a guy, he's also one of the truly great mx racers of all time.
But can he beat you out in the second moto here today, nerve?
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Especially if my trainer doesn't show up.
So the winner of the 1980 nationals here in anaheim is big Billy hunniker.
As of yet, no word from medics
as to the severity of injuries sustained to nerve nordlinger.
Max!
Oh, Max, what'd you miss!
How'd it happen?
I tripped. On your bike?
No, I tripped before the moto even began.
Over... over her.
She didn't see me coming,
though, I mean...
She... I tripped over her and fell.
Who are you?
We have them here too, you know.
We?
Where do you come from?
You're not going to take him away now, are you, your holiness?
Oh, no, he's much too young to die.
So am I.
I hope you're not mad at me for quitting the racing scene like that.
I mean, after all you've done for me.
Oh, don't be silly.
I was thinking of moving on anyway.
I'm gonna see you again, aren't I?
I don't think so.
I'm gonna be going a long ways away.
Well, hey, maybe I can see you wherever you're going.
No way.
I don't ever wanna see you where I'm going.
I mean... that everybody has their own thing to do in life, right?
Well, now, I gotta go to places that are really horrible.
Places that nice young man like yourself should never have to see.
Okay?
Well, am I at least gonna see you at the concert tonight?
No, I don't think so.
I'm gonna be giving up all my management contracts, even Stella's.
I'll see you around then.
Oh, yeah, I'll see you around.
Maxy!
Ah, thank you for my parents.
Thank you. Oh, it's... listen, Stella, you know how you seem to be cooling it on the performing thing and all?
Well, I think now is the perfect time to quit.
Now?
With my parents out front, before the concert?
Absolutely. All the more reason.
Max.
You know how you always wondered how come you could sing when I was out there
and not otherwise,
and I kept telling you
that I could work miracles,
and you believed me?
Well, I lied.
I can't make miracles, Stella.
And even if I could before,
I can't anymore.
You're gonna go out there and die.
You're gonna fall flat
on your face.
I am not.
I am not.
Stella,
I'm gonna prove it to you.
I'm gonna walk around this corner, and you try to sing, and you won't be able to.
Now I'm walking around the corner, Stella.
Max.
Max!
Come on.
Jerry and other others, they always said to me, said miracles is another word for confidence.
I don't know why you want to take my confidence away from me now.
You always been so good
to me, Max.
And if ever there was a time
I wanted to be good...
I don't believe you.
I'm not gonna let you do this to me.
Bye, Stella.
Have a happy...
Max.
You know, if I'm gonna fall on my face, you can watch.
Bye, Stella.
Bye.
Max?
I'm gonna miss you.
Oh, hi. You're back.
Yeah.
Not for long, I'm afraid.
What do you mean?
Uh, look...
At 12:00
I gotta be somewhere else.
So I guess
I oughta take off now.
But you'll be back.
You always come back.
Not this time, sport.
Where I'm going is too far away to come back from.
Uh, I just wanted to say good-bye.
You promised.
What's the matter?
Don't I rate a good-bye?
You know, it really stinks.
Every father I get always goes away and never comes back.
Are you gonna die on me too?
And what about mom?
Well, what's she gonna do?
Look, Toby, your mother's a great lady... she'll get along just fine without me.
No, I won't.
Toby.
I love you, Max.
How could you possibly love me?
I'm not lovable.
I'm not even nice.
I'm irresponsible, unreliable, you've said so yourself a million times.
Look, even if we try,
I'll still probably leave you without any warning.
I'm a rotten person.
The only trouble with you,
Max, is you have no self image.
You noticed?
Oh, my God.
I don't believe it.
What is it, Max? What's wrong?
It's me.
I don't believe it.
It's me in the mirror.
I-I don't believe it.
I won.
I won.
I won.
Won what?
I beat that lousy, rotten, slimy, no-good son of a... beat who?
Barney! I beat Barney!
He had my soul.
Are you all right, Max?
All right?
I've never been more all right in my life.
Hello.
That's the most amazing sight
I've ever seen.
You're talking crazy, Max.
Don't... I know it's crazy.
I know... I know...
I know it sounds crazy,
I know that, but it's so basic.
It's just so simple.
It's like it's good and bad.
And heaven and hell and God and the devil.
Penny, look, all my life,
I made wrong choices.
I made wrong choices!
But this time I made the right choice, and the devil lost my soul.
He lost me.
I'm gonna call the doctor.
No, no, no, please, please, penny, you have to trust me.
Please, trust me.
I swear,
I'll explain everything to you.
But you have to trust me now because I love you.
More than life itself.
And you're not leaving, right?
I'll never leave you.
Where's Toby?
Toby!
To... come on, we gotta go to a concert.
A concert?
Thank you.
Of all the audiences that I've ever sung for,
I know you're gonna be the best.
Thank you.
But you're also gonna be the last.
Just for a while.
Just for a while.
You see, a year is a...
A long time to be away from your family.
And your home.
And no matter how square you always thought they were, really do get to missing them.
Really get to missing school.
But now I'm going to miss all of you.
But most of all,
I'm gonna miss a man who...
It's, you know, it's that thing that everybody always says.
Except I really do mean it.
If it wasn't for him,
I wouldn't be here right now.
¶ So here I am ¶
¶ alone again ¶
¶ not all like I thought that I would be ¶
¶ yes, I lost my way ¶
¶ seems like yesterday ¶

¶ thinking that love would come for free ¶

¶ I hope that someone won't be me ¶ you see, maxy.
¶ So let go now, you're on your own ¶
¶ it's okay to be lonely

¶ open up your eyes ¶
¶ you are much too wise ¶
¶ if someone promises you sunshine ¶

Yes.
No!
Hey, George! Not a bad day?
Better than most.
- Going around to your therapy?
Yeh, I'm gonna see an neirologist.
- An o what neirologist?
Can I see?
What'll they think up next?
Excuse me, do you know where Willamette East Tower is?
Dr. Haber.
First floor, second elevator, please.
Hold it!
Hello!
- Yes?
I have an appointment with Dr. Haber.
Name, please.
- George Orr.
Dr. Haber's expecting you.
It's the last office on your right.
You can hang your raincoat over there.
Thank you.
Doctor, see overdose.
Yes?
Dr. Haber?
- Oh! Mr. Orr!
It's a pleasure to meet you. Come in.
Would you have a sit?
Do you smoke? The brown filters are tranks, the white are denicks.
Oh, no, thank you. I don't smoke.
Good. It's tough enough in here already.
Damn electric heating system on a freeze again, I'm afraid.
Well, it's ok!
Don't be nervous, Mr. Orr.
Your punishment is no worse than a few sessions with me.
That's better. Do you have your VT card?
Oh. Yes, here.
So, mixing Phenobarbital and Dexedrine?
Quite a dangerous concoction, won't you say?
Mr. Orr?
You have a dream problem, don't you?
How did you know?
- No great wit,
I'm an oneirologist,
Mr. Orr, a dream specialist.
They always send the dreamers to me.
Well, all I want is to stop dreaming.
- May I call you George?
Yeh, I guess –
Call me Bill, if you like.
- Oh, well that's ok!
However you would feel comfortable.
Dr. Haber, what are we supposed to do here?
We are going to work together.
We are going to build good relationship.
You're gonna let me inside, to poke around, find out what's causing those bad dreams of yours.
I assume that's what the problem is, bad dreams.
A sort of.
Why don't you tell me about it?
You'd think I was insane.
- I make no judgments, George.
I'm here to help you and that's all. Give it a try.
Suppose I dream, that there's no Dr. Haber.
Now, tomorrow, when I wake up, not only are you gone, but you never existed.
Pretty revealing, wouldn't you say?
Oh, no, I didn't mean that, personally.
- Perfectly ok.
You can tell me to go to hell, if you like. It's a part of building our trust.
I didn't mean that.
- I'd like you to lie down now, George.
What?
It's all right, go on.
It's all right,
George, just relax. Lie back.
Now, I want you to take deep breath and close your eyes.
Patient George Orr. Age 32, voluntary therapeutic treatment, drug abuse.
Recently good health, slightly undernourished, passive, repressed, maybe in intelligence confining.
You're relaxed, yes?
- Yes. - Good.
Now,
I'd like you to tell me more about these dreams that change reality.
Think back to the first one.
How old were you?
17. I was 17.
I was still living at home. Aunt Ethel, my mother's sister was living with us, she was getting a divorce.
She'd been there about six weeks.
And she was always in the way, she drove everybody crazy.
She kept making a joking play for me.
She was 30, kind of sexy, she got me up tight. And she was always trying to turn me on.
And one night while we were watching television, something happened.
How can I have done it!
She was my aunt, for God's sake!
I used to have these dreams about her.
And that night I had a really vivid dream.
And then, when I woke up in the morning, aunt Ethel wasn't living with us, she never had lived with us.
A telegram that had come from
Los Angeles, my mother was crying.
Aunt Ethel had been killed in car crash.
And that was it.
It was my first effective dream.
And nobody else noticed that aunt
Ethel had suddenly vanished?
My dreams change everything that comes before them.
And nobody knows it was me.
I killed her.
George, I want you to understand something; there is a difference between what you dream and what you do.
But not for me! It's the same thing.
And I can't control what I –
What you can control is all of this guilt and anxiety.
That's exactly what we'll be working on together in the next few sessions.
Dr. Haber, you can't help me.
- George, if I thought you're about to lose your balance,
I wouldn't let you out of here so quickly, believe me.
What I will do is give you a prescription for Meprobamate.
That will keep your dreams low-keyed without repressing the dream state entirely.
But it's only temporary. I expect to see you back here, same time next week.
I don't mean to kill her.
Mr. Orr.
Infraction of Federal regulations controlling dispensation of medications at autodrugstores.
It says here, you've begun voluntary treatment with Dr. Haber, correct? - Yes.
You've surrendered your pharmacy card to authorities?
Yes.
I've only have a prescription from Dr. Haber.
Here it is.
All right, I'll have to issue you a temporary pharmacy card.
But don't abuse it. And as is your right, if you have any complaints here's an HEW approved list of public investigators.
Any other complaints?
Just with my dreams.
- Not my jurisdiction. Next!
You gonna use that on me?
- Correct!
This is what happens.
First, I'm going to hypnotize you and put you to sleep.
And you'll go through several stages of sleep, the final one being the dream state or REM sleep.
And the Augmentor here will pass you quickly through those first stages and lock you into ram sleep.
You will allow me to hold you there and watch your brain at work.
My brain?
- Yes. then I'll suggest a dream to you.
In your case, an effective dream.
Oh, that's dangerous!
For the Augmentor changes nothing, George.
Miss Crouch, could you bring Mr. Orr the
Consent to Hypnosis form, please. Thank you!
Do you trust me, George?
Ok.
Good, now I'd like you to lye back and get comfortable.
Now, is this comfortable?
Look what a nice healthy signal from your brain.
So at the top screen here, those are your theta rhythms, nice healthy thetas.
And only a three on susceptibility scale, we could be here all afternoon.
I'm gonna to perform the V-C induction.
I'll see you are not disturbed.
Now, George. I'd like you to relax.
I'd like you to look up at the ceiling.
You don't have a simple brain, my friend, nor a crazy one.
Now, you're beginning to get sleepy, George, very relaxed, so relaxed, you can't move a muscle.
Your eyelids are very heavy.
You're going to go to sleep now, George.
And while you're sleepy, you'll have no trouble hearing my voice.
And you will wake up, when you hear me call your name three times.
You're going to sleep now.
Can you hear my voice, George?
Mh.
Good.
No sigmoid jags usually prevalent and certain in schizoid personality types.
Sleep patterns ± normal.
Uh, you're beginning to dream now, George.
REM patterns ± unusual.
Something very unusual in the whole pointing area.
When I say the word "Antwerp" you are going to have a dream I suggest to you.
It will be a pleasant, vivid dream about a horse in a meadow, beautiful set.
It will be a good dream, George.
An effective dream about a horse. Antwerp!
George! George!
George!
Feel ok?
Yeh!
Well, you did dream, my friend!
That much I can tell you.
What was it about?
A horse. It was about a horse.
That one.
What about it?
Don't you notice anything unusual about that picture?
Oh, some people find it a bit overwhelming.
You know what's Freud said about horses, staircases and cigars?
Was it here an hour ago?
- An hour ago?
Yes, wasn't that a picture of
Mount Hood when I came in?
Mount Hood?
Yeh, I remember it, don't you?
George, that is Tammany Hall, the triple crown-winner.
Oh, I'm insane!
No, I'm not insane!
I'm not insane. I know I'm not insane!
So not to drive me insane!
- Back up, George!
Dreams are not harmful, for instance, day dreams can be wonderful.
I have them all withy. I dream heroics.
I save the girl, the whole damn planet.
Haber saves the world!
Yeh, I daydream sometimes, that I have a cabin by the ocean.
- Eh, that's nice. What does that tell you about yourself?
That I am a massacre; nobody can afford a cabin by the ocean anymore.
You know, what I'd like to see, George?
I'd like to see you learn to use your dreams.
Doesn't that strike you as a nice idea?
I don't know.
Well, we'll work on it.
You're feeling very sleepy,
George. Very relaxed.
You're going to sleep in a moment.
Now sleep George.
Sleep!
In a moment I'm going to suggest a dream to you.
And you will dream that dream.
You are going to have a very good dream, George.
Beautiful sunshine, no smog, no rain.
¬Antwerp! ®
What a hell is he doing?
The Augmentor is not doing, ah.
Penny – - Is something wrong?
No. No, nothing at all!
Doctor, are you all right?
Yes, yes of course!
Get me a report on weather on the line.
- Yes, Doctor!
George! George! George!
What did you dream, George?
It was an effective dream,
I can tell you that.
Can you recall it?
Yes.
I was having a picnic on Mount Hood in the rain with Genghis Khan
And his umbrella lit.
And then the sun came out.
I have weather on line 2, Doctor.
That's good.
Schedule for Mr. Orr for noon tomorrow.
Can you make it, George?
Yes, but why should –?
- Good.
Good.
It's actually stopped raining.
All right, George, go on now.
I'll see you tomorrow.
This is the weather report for Portland, the Sunshine city.
The temperature is 105 degrees Fahrenheit,
40 degrees Celsius.
Humidity is 8%, the barometer is 29.80 –
You see, it's because of all this sunshine!
We were better off when it rained all the time.
- Yes, that's the truth!
He knows!
He knows!
Son of a bitch knows!
- I'm not insane, am I?
- Oh, no, of course not!
Why didn't you tell me back in the office?
George, I thought we had a very good session this afternoon, extraordinary really.
But don't you think we can continue this tomorrow?
But, wait a minute, you're acting like nothing happened.
Oh, a great deal happened, but let's not make more of it than it is!
We have a long way to go.
My dream stopped the rain.
George, it hasn't rained in Portland since two years ago last Easter.
Why are you doing this to me?
One cardinal rule of this therapy, never hand the answers for the patient on a silver platter.
Now you must work for them otherwise they are meaningless.
- The sun is out!
It stopped raining.
- Yes, it's beautiful, isn't it?
You told me to dream a sunny day and I did, now you admit it.
George,
It's impossible to correct a defective reality or intension of it over night.
But we are making the real progress.
I'll see you tomorrow.
But – - Tomorrow!
Orr?
- Yes.
Heather Lelache. Please, be sitted.
Was this an accident?
What?
- Your overdose.
No. Yes!
My legal advice is agree to the psychiatric treatment and you won't be prosecuted, or prosecuted for that matter.
But the therapy scares me.
Come on, Mr. Orr.
I don't mean to cause Dr. Haber any trouble.
I'm sure he means well.
I'd just like another psychiatrist.
- Oh, not without real cause.
I mean, they're no gonna take a patient's word against a doctor's.
Not in this kind of case.
You mean a mental case.
- Exactly.
Well.
Thank you very much, Miss Lelache.
Sorry to have bothered you.
- Wait a moment.
I didn't say you didn't have a case.
It's just...
Well you haven't told me anything yet.
If I told you what was really going on you'd think I was crazy.
I'm a Civil liberties lawyer, Mr. Orr.
If you have something to say you'd better say it.
He's not an evil man and he means well.
It's just...
I'm in a position to be used by him, like an instrument.
He can't do that even if he aims at good.
Nobody can play God.
But he doesn't realize that.
That's why I tried taking drugs to suppress my dreams.
I just wanna get cured.
- Of drugs?
Of dreaming!
What a hell are you talking about?
Well, Miss Crouch, I'd like you to do some research for me.
Use a computer linked up to the Library of Congress in the lobby.
Do you think the others will mind?
No, I don't think so, I was definitely got allowed.
- Good.
I'd like you to get me as much information is possible on the effective dreams symbology in pre-Columbian culture.
I may be a while.
- Take as much time as you need.
Be very thorough, Miss Crouch.
- Yes, Doctor.
Listen carefully, George.
You and I are about to embark upon a magnificent collaboration.
We are going to make history today.
Using your gift I'm going to do what no politician, no scientist, no philosopher has ever done.
I'm going to make the whole world... right!
We need an institute,
William Haber Institute of Oneirology.
"Antwerp!"
George! George!
George!
Take it easy, don't sit up so fast.
Oh, no!
Something wrong, George?
- Doctor?
Oh, Miss Crouch!
- I have that research information you wanted, Doctor Haber.
That didn't take you any time at all, did it?
Amazing what computers can do.
Is there anything else, Dr. Haber?
- Yes, I'd like you to schedule Mr. Orr for noon tomorrow.
I can't make it!
- Yes, Doctor!
But I can't make it!
- Why not?
Because I have a job! Now I can't keep coming here, they will fire me!
Your therapy is more important than your job!
In any case the institute will clear you.
Don't tell me that institute stuff,
I know what's going on here!
Aha! End in active resistance; it's a good sign, George. Let it out!
Look! You don't know what you're doing!
- When you change one thing, you would...
- You see, you're not really resisting me, you're resisting your own self examination.
It happens in every therapeutic situation.
- Look, I'm not gonna do this anymore!
George, I had hoped that your motivation for being here would be better by now.
What about getting well?
Yeh, what about it? You tell me!
- I am going to cure you, George.
You have my word on that.
You must believe me.
I would like to believe you,
Dr. Haber. I really would.
Good. Then we have something in common.
Why doesn't this Dr. Haber just come right out and say that he knows you have effective dreams?
I think he's waiting to find out more before he lets me know what's going on.
Can't stand that I blame him.
The thing that bothers me is what he will do next.
What do you mean?
Unlimited power means unlimited danger.
Well, according to you is only change one penny in the weather.
Not to mention small improvements to his office.
Then there's the cabin.
- What cabin?
I have a ten-year lease on the cabin overlooking the ocean.
You do?
I won it in the Government lottery.
Can I buy you a lunch?
I'd really like to help you, Mr. Orr.
What am I supposed to do if you keep changing the reality all the way back to the
Stone Age and then destroying the evidence?
I wouldn't expect you to believe me with that evidence.
- Oh, well, thank God!
What I'd like is for you to come to a session.
Doubtful without good cause.
But what am I supposed to do?
Let this guy keep treating me like an experimental animal while he goes around tinkering?
- Did you say ¬experimental ®?
Yeh.
What do you mean?
Haber says he's still working on it.
Have you signed anything, any releases, anything beyond the
VT forms and Consent to hypnosis?
I don't think so.
- You've got a case!
- I do?
- Great!
Let's just keep one thing straight.
This doesn't mean I believe a word of your story.
All it means is if I can prove this thing is experimental, and then maybe just maybe I can get you switched to another shrink.
Then you will come to a session?
- But not as your lawyer.
I'll arrange to come as an
HEW impartial observer on investigation of that thin gummy in general, ok?
Dr. Haber.
- Yes, Penny. - This has just arrived, the population report you wanted.
Yes.
- Dr. Murgin called on a consultation.
Tell him I'm too busy.
- And this notice is from HEW, they are sending an observer this morning to look at the Augmentor.
What?
Damn bureaucrats.
Why don't they mind their own business.
- Oh, and Mr. Orr is here, Doctor.
Well, George. You're early today.
Something like a breakthrough, I'd say, with your
 usual 15 minutes late. - I am?
So, how are you feeling today?
- So-so.
How can anyone feel so-so on a magnificent day like this?
Well, you know the Greek say,
Moderation in all things.
So, what would you like to talk about today?
I don't care.
Do you have somewhere to go, George?
Oh, no. I'm just anxious to get started.
Well, another breakthrough.
Two in one session. Shall we try for three?
Yes, what is it?
- Miss Lelache from HEW is here.
All right, send her.
Seems that my fame has brought me to the attention of HEW.
They are sending an observer to make sure my work with the Augmentor is on the up and up.
Isn't that ridiculous?
Dr. Haber, this is Heather Lelache.
Pleasure to meet you, Miss Lelache.
Won't you have a sit right here?
I assume you were informed
I'll be recording the proceedings.
Perhaps, you'd better ask the patient's permission.
Mr. Orr! This is Miss Lelache of HEW.
Do you mind, Mr. Orr?
- No, go ahead.
Very well. Dr. Haber is the patient diagnosed as neurotic or psychotic?
The patient's diagnosis is not for public record,
Miss Lelache. I'm surprised at you.
Besides it's my Augmentor that interests you, right?
Well, anyway you know what they say?
Neurotics build castles in the sky, psychotics live in them.
And psychiatrists collect the rent.
Hm, very good.
Very good, Miss Lelache.
Well, have you any questions before we start?
Can you explain the role of your device?
Yes, of course. My Augmentor here merely insures that my patient will dream by instigating and reinforcing his own dream-state activity.
What would you say, George?
Shall we run off a dream?
- Ok.
Incidentally, Miss Lelache, this will constitute a record to your people that my
Augmentor does not loosen toenails, or harden arteries, or blow your mind, or have any ill effects whatsoever.
Standard hypnotic procedure, Miss Lelache.
It will be a little bit disconcerting to the patient, I will admit.
Please, turn your recorder off.
The therapy session is not for public record.
Notice the accelerated pulse and the rapid eye movements.
He is ready to accept the suggested dream.
Now, George, the last time you were here, you were telling me about something that bothered you very much.
You said you felt restricted, closed in on the subway, in your office, in the streets.
Do you remember the word you used?
What does he say?
- Overpopulation, that's what he said.
Now, George, when I say the word ¬Antwerp ® you are going to have an effective dream about this thing that bothers you, this overpopulation.
You're going to dream about space, about all the elbow room in the world.
You feel uncrowded, unsqueezed.
And this overpopulation thing will not be a problem anymore.
"Anwerp!"
My God!
What has he done?
Six billion people!
All the people – all – the people –
George.
George!
George!
You had a bad one, George!
Where are they?
Where are the people?
- You've dreamt about the plague.
Plague?
- That's all over now.
All of us who survived are genetic clue resistant.
What plague?
- Oh, my God!
I just killed six billion people.
I'm afraid, it's the first time Mr. Orr has handled anxiety in the dream.
It's not always pleasant.
- I don't understand what's happening.
Don't you remember the plague?
- Of course, we do!
I lost my parents, my two sisters,
I watch them die. None of us could ever forget it.
But it's over now, George.
The plague ended five years ago and we are the survivors.
Life must go on.
You remember the plague, don't you?
Don't you remember that you've never heard of the plague until just now?
But there wasn't any plague until an hour ago.
You remember, don't you? Remember!
- George,
Miss Lelache isn't highly qualified to comment on your session.
She is only an observer.
I'm afraid he is a bit agitated.
He has been at difficult times.
Perhaps you'd better return.
- Yes.
I shall send you a full report on the
Augmentor's operation and current uses that you'd take care of it.
I'm sorry you've found this distressing, Miss Lelache.
But that was a real crisis session. Good bye.
Thank you.
Well, we really did it this time, didn't we?
Come away from the window, George.
- You saw it?
She saw it?
Six billion people wiped off the face of the Earth.
What do you want me to say?
I want you to be straight with me.
Why don't you go home, George?
Admit! Take responsibility for it!
Oh, I see, you're trying to transfer it all to me.
You want me to take responsibility for your problem.
Well, I can't do that, George. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry you had a bad dream, George.
But it was your dream, it came from you, from inside of you!
I'm cracked up.
Surely, you can see that!
You're a psychiatrist.
I'm gone to peaces here.
You'll ask me to dream again and what kind of world we're gonna get?
Maybe totally insane one, full of monsters, daemons or witches, dragons, all the things that we carry round in psychics, all the nightmares, the fears? What's gonna happen when night gets loose on the world?
Are you quite finished?
Your negative approach to our –
It's your positive approach, that's the danger!
Solve the population problem!
See what happens!
Don't you see that these things aren't problems?
They don't have answers that you can find in your arithmetic book.
Defeatism. We were put here to make the world a better place.
Your attempts to use my dreams that make the world a better place can destroy it!
It's not so hard to destroy the world, Dr. Haber.
We did it four years ago, April.
I don't know what you are talking about.
Don't think that you can outthink God.
You're worn out, George.
You'd better go home, get some rest, the session is over.
You – - Go home, George.
I don't know where home is anymore.
You're acting like nothing happened.
My dream stopped the rain.
George, it doesn't rain in Portland since two years ago last Easter.
Oh, my God!
I've just wiped up three quarters of the world's population.
- What do you want me to say?
- I want you to be straight with me.
Why don't you go home now, George?
Oh, my God! Why are you doing this to me?
Damn!
George? What are you doing here?
I want the truth.
Well, come up to my office, we'll discuss it.
- We'll discuss it right here!
All right. If you insist.
I suppose I should have told you earlier, George.
I just wanted time to sort things out.
Yes, I know about your dreams.
I've known for quite some time.
Thank you.
Thank you, Dr. Haber for being honest.
You have a great gift, George.
Together we can learn to use it.
You can't use my dreams to change this, haven't you learnt that yet?
Isn't that the purpose of man on Earth?
To act. To change things. To run things. To build a better world.
No.
- What then?
I don't know.
I don't know. Things don't have purposes.
I don't know if life has a purpose.
I can't say that it matters. It IS. We ARE.
I wanna stop.
George I know that I can learn to harness your power but you must give me time.
- That's no use.
We haven't got the right.
- We have a duty!
Why do you exist?
Why do you feel your own power?
Because it doesn't work.
You change one thing and everything changes.
The plague didn't solve anything.
We're closer to the war now than we have been.
I can't let you use me anymore.
George, you need me, George. You know that.
Without me you're out of control.
I want you to dream peace on Earth.
No more war, no more mass killings of humans by other humans, no more fighting in Asia, Africa, the Middle East or anywhere in the world.
¬Antwerp! ®
George! George! George!
Stop of it! What are you doing?
- What?
I told you to dream peace on Earth.
I didn't dream that.
I dreamt about the Moon.
A battle.
A battle in space.
Alien force is attacking the Earth colony on the Moon.
I don't believe it.
I told you to dream away man is humanity to man. And what did you do?
You united the world against of the alien invasion.
What a stupid wasteful way to get peace on Earth!
Oh, my God!
What kind of monster have you extricated down of my unconscious?
I don't know what I dreamed on.
And all of it I could drag out of your unconscious.
This is incredible! Aliens on the Moon.
You must go back on them, George!
Dream them away right now!
I told you something like this is gonna happen.
What are you doing?
- I'm not gonna dream for you anymore!
Oh, that's absurd, you can't leave things like this.
- I did what you told me to do,
I did what the doctors told, the lawyers. Nothing works!
George!
- No, forget it!
George!
You'll be back, George.
Without me you have no hope.
George!
George!
Yeh?
I'm looking for George Orr, have you seen him?
- No, he is gone.
Gone? Where?
I don't know. I've already dreamed a few hours ago. Who are you?
Heather Lelache. I'm his lawyer,
I've got to talk to him.
Do you have any idea where he might be?
You got some ID?
- Yes,
HEW public investigator.
All right where he might be is in his cab.
Why don't you drive there?
Well, a phone number, do you have a phone number?
Oh, he got no phone. Say, what's so important anyway? Do you do some?
- Yes.
Please, do you have an address?
Oh, I don't know, it's somewhere up on the Coast Range Beach, where those
Government lotteries came.
You won't find it yourself.
Thanks!
Now you know it's true, my dreams change everything.
And you see why I have to get away from Haber.
I know. I understand.
- He's making me dream. You saw what happened.
I can't let him make me dream anymore.
What happened with the aliens on the Moon.
You don't mean that you –
If you only knew how really scared I'm right now.
I wish I could sleep without dreaming.
Maybe you can! Maybe I could suggest a dream.
No.
- Sure. It could be a dream about nothing.
What do you mean?
- Nothing more happens, nothing more changes.
No, it's too risky.
It'll work, I know it will. I've seen it done before.
I'll just hypnotize you.
I don't know.
We have no choice.
Listen to the sound of my voice.
Relax.
Take yourself down.
Farther.
You feel relaxed and easy.
That's it. You're floating.
I'm going to tell you that you're going to sleep.
And you will, but not until I say it.
Everything is heavy.
You try to lift your hand but you can't.
It's heavy.
Oh, I think it's working, George.
Now, you're gonna do some dreaming.
You are going to have one effective dream.
And it's going to be about – oh, my God!
I can't tell him to dream about nothing!
In this dream you will dream, everything is Ok, dream the aliens off the Moon.
Tomorrow, when you're awaken, you will feel rested and well.
Now, go to sleep.
This is an invasion alert.
An invasion alert!
Aliens are invading!
Invasion alert! Invasion alert!
George, wake up! Something's wrong!
- What's a matter?
Don't you hear that?
What did you tell me to dream of?
That everything is ok, the aliens are off the Moon.
That's it. They're off the Moon.
They are here.
Come on! We've got to get back for Haber.
Not we were trying to get away from him?
- Yeh, but now we have no choice.
Turn on the radio!
A new retaliation. 8 Anti-Alien Ballistic
Missiles have been dispatched from our underground installations in Walla Walla, Washington, and Round Valley, Californi...
And this just in, the alien ships appeared to be carrying a device that has taken control of our Missile Guidance systems.
Where a hell have you been?
- It's not important, we're back.
This is your doing, isn't it?
You had a dream without me, didn't you.
I told you that this would happened, didn't I, I told you!
It's up to us now.
Look, go down to the basement, find the main generator, put your finger to the on/off button.
And if the power fails you push it. Now go on!
I'll be all right, George.
Go ahead it, Haber.
George, something new.
I want you to stop the invasion, George.
Dream peace.
Dream that we are at peace with everyone.
Everyone! ¬Antwerp! ®
Come on. Come on!
Pardon me.
Do not do to others what you wish others not to do to you.
Of course not. Of course not!
We are attempting to make peaceful arrival, we do not have weapons.
We are nonaggressive, infighting species.
Please, tell others.
I can't control the air force.
George! George!
Is this a military installation?
No. George! George!
Please, excuse us for the accidental intrusion.
Thank you very much.
Well, that wasn't so bad, was it?
Don't play games with me!
You look scared to death.
I'm just about having it with you, Orr.
This is no joke. I could have been killed!
Were you sure to have thought of that before.
Oh, God damn subconscious twists around everything I say.
He's just an alien. Nice guy, you were talking with him.
Well, I feel good.
I'm starving, I'm gonna get something to eat and find Heather. You want a sandwich?
What about the invasion?
- You've heard him, they are friendly.
Weren't you supposed to make a phone call or something?
Yes, of course!
But to whom?
Well, you know the people in Washington.
Tell them to stop shooting at the aliens.
I'll call Tchaikovsky in HEW.
- All right! See you!
Secretary Tchaikovsky, please.
Bill Haber calling.
Hello, Nat! Bill Haber here. Fine. Fine.
Listen, Nat, about this alien thing.
I think I've got that figured out.
I hate terrible fish.
How do you feeling?
I was fine till I ate this.
- Aha! There you are!
Well, you get everything straight right now?
Oh, I'd say so.
- Good.
Mmm, dreadful.
Well, we've eliminated war and hunger, but we still can't come up with a decent cup of coffee.
You know, George.
Before all of this alien business
I had some good news for you.
Oh, really?
You remember of course, that I gave you my word that I would cure you.
Yeh, he did say that. He did.
I know it's been a very distressing time for you.
But as soon as my Augmentor program is complete you'll be cured.
What would you say, you'll come along with me now and we'll get to work on it.
I don't think so. Not today.
But, George, you can be cured!
Hey, wait a minute!
- Not today...
I have a big surprise for you, George.
Just follow me.
You know what I was wrong all of these months was that I was searching for an entity.
An omega-wave. Well there isn't any.
The pattern is formed by a combination of other waves.
Now, over the past few days before hell broke loose I worked it out.
The cycle is 12 seconds.
Can you imagine, 12 seconds?
I don't know why
I didn't think of that before.
Well, your dream pattern is a complexly synchronized set of emissions that take exactly 12 seconds to complete their cycle and start again.
It's to an ordinary dream state what a Bach fugue is to a ¬Mary had a little lamb ®.
I didn't know this was here.
Let me out of here!
George?
Mh?
- My apologies, George.
The greatest good for the greatest number.
All right, George, Now we're going to run a little test.
Only one more access and my Augmentor programming will be complete.
One more. Then you will be superfluous.
And I can get on with the job.
Jor Jor.
Jor Jor.
Damn.
To reprogram his whole last quarter.
Stupid chicken brain of his!
Take him down again, all away!
If help wanted, inquire within.
Power may be controlled only at source.
I'd hate to lose you, George.
But you leave me no choice.
Those whom heaven helps we
 call the sons of heaven.
They do not reason by using reason.
To let understanding stop at what cannot be understood is a higher attainment.
Those who cannot do it will be destroyed on the lathe of heaven.
The lathe of heaven.
Jor Jor.
Jor Jor.
All right, George. We are going to take on a really big one this time.
Something that's been wasting a lot of the world's valuable time.
Racism.
When I say ¬Antwerp ®
I want you to dream me a world in which there is no color problem.
Where everyone is completely integrated.
Antwerp!
You did it, George! You did it the rational way for once you really did!
Your primary purpose was thinking right to the heart of the problem and made the change biological at absolute!
It was the perfect solution, George!
You were to be congratulated.
All right, back to work.
Now, it's time for our big moment. George.
You're about to have your last effective dream.
Our partnership is almost at an end.
I'm going to give you something you've always wanted - to be cured.
Dream that you've lost the ability to dream effectively.
Dream me my ultimate Augmentor. Antwerp!
George.
George.
George.
Welcome to Dr. Haber's Palace of dreams.
Congratulations, George. You're the man of the hour. How do you feel today?
I haven't felt anything for days.
- You may go.
Take it easy, George. Take it easy.
I know, I've been working with you very hard.
But I think you agree that was worth the effort.
Besides, today is a momentous occasion.
Well, I don't think that
I can take another big day.
George, today I've cured you.
Don't you have anything to say?
- Words fail me.
It's quite simple. You have had your last effective dream.
Wonderful.
- In it... you dreamed you've lost the ability to dream effectively.
It's that simple?
- It's simple. But not that simple.
My Augmentor here is now complete.
The last piece of the puzzle is in.
By the way where is he?
- Who?
The alien.
There are no aliens here, George.
They are not permitted in this part of the building. They are unnatural.
In fact, when I begin to dream they are the first thing I'm going to get rid of.
Is that what you've been up to all this time?
That's right, George.
The burden is now off your shoulders.
And it on to yours!
You're out of your mind!
Now you listen to me, George Orr!
You come into my office with the greatest power the mankind has ever known and all you want to do is to be cured of it.
The dreams don't work you tell me.
They go wrong you tell me.
Well, there's nothing wrong with the dreams, my friend. The problem lies with the dreamer.
Well, now, George, you must be tired.
I think you should go home now to get some rest. I'll come down with you.
You are an imperfect instrument, George.
You're not a man of vision.
And you are?
- I know what I'm doing.
Scientifically and morally.
After all, I've been controlling your dreams for the past few weeks.
You can't be entirely blind when
I've accomplished already.
Since we've begun working together, George, we've eliminated overpopulation.
We installed the quality of urban life, the ecological balance of the planet, eliminated
cancer as a major killer, eliminated racial hatred,
the color problem, eliminated war, eliminated the risk of species to
 deterioration so inferior its genetic stock.
Eliminated no, say, in the process of eliminating poverty, economic inequality, the class war all over the world.
Progress, George, progress.
You're right, George. The greatest good for the greatest number.
Progress, George, progress.
We've made more progress in six weeks than humanity has made in the past six thousand years.
While you think about all of this progress you can help me to find Heather.
Who?
Heather Lelache, the lawyer from HEW.
- Oh, yes. What happened to her?
I don't know, she's gone.
Oh, she's out there somewhere.
I doubt it. She was brown not gray.
Well, our time has come to an end, George.
The symbiotic relationship is over.
But a new era begins.
Good bye, George.
Hey, Haber!
What?
I was just thinking – wouldn't it be funny if I wasn't the only one who could dream effectively.
What if everybody could do it?
And reality was being – pulled up from under us all the time.
And we didn't even know it.
Well, it's just a thought.
I'll sleep on it.
Good day, Jor Jor.
Jor Jor?
You, Jor Jor.
- Me?
No, my name is George Orr.
- Right, Jor Jor.
Ok, Jor Jor. How did you know my name?
Gift of perception is mutual.
Do you wish an object?
No, I'm just looking.
- Please. Continue this activity.
I don't suppose you know a woman named Lelache?
Do you seek Lelache?
- Yes, I've lost her.
Person sought can be found.
Help is available.
Is it acceptable?
Yes, I mean thank you very much.
Clarity is pleasurable.
With a little help from my friends?
What would you think if i sang out of tune,
Would you stand up and walk out on me.
Lend me your ears and i'll sing you a song,
And i'll try not to sing out of key.
I get by with a little help from my friends,
I get high with a little help from my friends,
Going to try with a little help from my friends.
What do i do when my love is away?
How do i feel by the end of the day?
No i get by with a little help from my friends,
Do you need anybody,
I need somebody to love.
I get by with a little help from my friends.
Hi, sleepyhead!
Heather!
All right, and just who were you expecting?
My little wonderful wife!
Yeh.
- You're brown!
Oh, I'm sorry, this mud only comes of one colour.
What's wrong?
Oh, I slept so well.
Yeh, you needed that do.
You came home half dead last night.
That stupid shrink Haber sent you home that way and said you're cured.
Haber –
Forget him, George, you're free now.
We are together and, well, we can be happy.
What is it?
- I don't know.
What is it, George?
Let's get out of here.
Manny!
Manny!
Manny!
George, I'm scared.
I've never felt anything like this before.
I have.
4 years ago.
What's going on?
Oh, God, it's happening again!
- What's happening?
4 years ago, 4 years ago in April.
Don't you remember? Nobody does except me.
What happened 4 years ago?
- It's when everything started – or it ended.
George! George!
What a hell is this, George?
What did you mean, 4 years ago in April?
What happened?
There was a war.
They set the bomb dropped right down by the river.
I was trying to get out of the city.
Guess I had radiation sickness already.
I guess I was dying.
And I had this dream that I was alive.
Ever since then I've tried to tell myself that was a dream.
But it wasn't.
This is the dream.
Haber!
I can't! I can't do it!
Haber!
Haber!
Haber!
Jor Jor!
Jor Jor!
Jor Jor!
Fatigue is evident.
I did a lot today.
At least I did something.
Probably the only thing I ever did.
You have lived well.
May I see that egg whisk, please?
Heather?
Do I know you?
We've met a long time ago.
You're a lawyer, right?
- Yes.
How did you know?
- You want that?
No. Thank you.
You were very good to me.
Good.
Listen!
Yes?
I was wondering if I could return a favor.
Can I take you to lunch?
- Well thank you, but...
- I mean if you have the time.
Ok. Why not.
I'll be back in an hour, E'nememen Asfah.
Take afternoon, there is time.
- Thanks!
To go is to return.
Dr. Haber?
Dr. Haber?
I don't think he can hear you.
What happened to him?
- Nobody seems to know exactly.
He was on the verge of an enormous discovery.
And now?
A breakdown. Ever since that night that everything fell apart, you know?
You've seen that, haven't you?
The world after April.
Who was that?
- Someone I knew once.
I'm starving. Let's go and have that lunch.
Lead the way.
Subtitles by Victoria and Eugene-80.
We cannot always understand the need to remove a faithful husband...
.from the bosom of a loving wife.
Or a devoted father from the side of his only son.
Yet, let us not cling to the souls of the departed...
• . .but rather embrace our fond memories of them.
And Lord, we asked that you grant us the wisdom to accept your goodness.
Let it rain, so fertile earth will give us seeds to sow and bread to eat.
And let the words coming out of my mouth do the same.
They will not return to me empty, but shall do as I please.
And they shall succeed in what I sent them for.
Lord, have mercy on sinners like us.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Go forth, be joyous and be guided by peace, Amen.
— My deepest sympathy.
—Thank you.
Joey, be brave, son.
Mrs. Collins.
I am so sorry.
Chin up, son.
My, how you’ve grown.
You don’t remember us, do you?
Uncle Brad and Aunt Margaret.
You’re the man of the family now.
I am so sorry.
I cant do it.
I simply cant finish the tower.
I know exactly how to do it, but...
.without you, its just no fun.
Im really trying to think of it.
About what you said.
The whole time I am trying to imagine you are here.
But it makes me even sadder.
Dad, I miss you so much.
Thats it, great!
Come on, Joey.
Now try and throw it.
Come on.
Yes, great!
Again. Show me what you got.
Come on, yes!
Daddy, please come back.
Slow down. Stop.
When I open my eyes everything will be over.
Please.
Don’t you hear? Stop now, please!
Charlie.
Daddy, that’s not possible.
Daddy. That just can’t be.
Oh, no.
All my toys started going mad.
Yes. And Charlie, the little robot you gave me last Christmas...
.makes the funniest sounds now.
No, really. It’s crazy!
But if I can hear you, why can’t I see you?
I dont understand it. I can definitely feel that you are here.
Not much new otherwise.
Jessica finally left today.
It was about time.
And in two weeks
I have to go back to school.
Too bad! But maybe Ill make the basketball team this year.
— Daddy, don’t leave me again.
— Dear God, please help me...
Promise? You can’t do that.
Never again. Please.
Daddy... I love you.
We were discussing this fellow here yesterday...
• . and we have seen that he doesnt lay eggs.
Today we will discuss the ordinary chicken egg.
I hope you all brought your own.
A chicken egg is built in a way that it cant be broken lengthwise.
— Hold it with the small part facing up...
— Bernie, Bernie, now he has it.
This is what your father looks like now.
Bobbie, if you keep eating like this, you’ll burst.
Joey, what do you have there?
Let me see it?
This kind of humor is going too far.
— What if your father had died...
— But he is not dead, he still calls him.
— What is this nonsense?
— Thats what the loony said.
Now listen closely...
• . .Joey loved his father and surely thinks about him a lot.
Maybe he cant believe that hell never see him again.
I dont think its fair making fun of him.
Joey, where is your egg?
Did somebody take it?
— William, did you take it?
— Me? No, I didnt.
— Bernie?
— Me? No.
— Michael?
— No, for sure not.
Im waiting for an answer.
Who took it from him?
Okay, if that’s how you want it.
You’re all staying after school.
Quiet, for Pete’s sake!
A pretty cruel joke.
Joey simply isnt being accepted.
He cant seem to make friends.
— I tried everything with no success.
— I dont understand that.
I thought he was all right or I wouldnt have sent him back to school.
He misses his father.
Thats the problem.
— Yes, I know.
— There’s something else.
The kids make fun of him for talking to his father on the phone.
— The kids say that?
— No, Joey says that.
If your telephone went crazy last night... don’t get upset, your neighbor’s did the same.
At 10 pm, the phone system of Virginia
Beach collapsed for half an hour.
And now the weather.
Dream weather, blue sky, sunshine...
Joey.
Charlie, wait, he’s not hurting you.
Scooter, stop!
What are you doing up there?
Dinners ready.
Scooter, leave him alone!
He must be in there.
Charlie, do you hear me?
Get out of there.
What’s that?
Joey?
Charlie, be quiet already.
How could you stand it down there?
Its much nicer here than being around this old junk.
Scooter!
Joey, you have five more seconds.
— Five seconds are over.
— No, they aren’t.
By the time you come the food is cold.
Dont make that face again.
I was watching that.
First you eat and then its time for bed.
Drink your milk.
— Do that again.
— What?
What you just did.
Give it to me.
Now, do it again.
My God!
Who taught you that trick?
— Its not a trick...
— Don’t tell me, sure it is.
— Do it again.
— I don’t want to.
Please, Joey, I want to know.
You do it under the table, right?
Come on, I want to learn it.
— Its really not a trick.
— No.
— How do you do it?
— I just wish it.
You just wish it?
Daddy helps me.
Daddy?
Dont be afraid.
— I dont have to be afraid?
— III get it.
Come on.
Okay, then stay here.
You are evil.
What do you want?
Jonathan Fletcher was the last great Vaudeville performer.
In the thirties he created a new show, Fletcher and Fletcher.
He was to become world famous, but his partner, the Fletcher dummy...
— . . .soon turned into a malicious being.
— What do you want from me?
After the tragic death of his wife and child in an accident...
• . .he stopped performing.
In the late forties he returned with his show and had a great comeback.
In 1954 he died under mysterious circumstances in afire...
Answer me. Who are you?
Or leave me alone.
• . many people doubted the burned remains were Jonathan Fletchers.
• . .because neither traces of the dummy...
I don’t want to have anything to do with you, do you understand?
Mommy.
Please, leave her alone.
Stop doing that, stop!
Stop it! Mommy!
Whats wrong?
Did he lock you out?
Joey, what are you trying to do?
Scare me to death?
Joey, whats going on with you?
Why isnt the light on?
Whats the matter with you?
You were never afraid before.
— Im not afraid.
— Of course not.
Were you on the phone again?
Joey, somethings wrong with you.
What happened in the kitchen?
Wont you tell me?
— I cant.
— You cant?
Its okay.
Everything is okay.
Well talk about it tomorrow, alright?
Regarding the latest shutdown of the Virginia Beach phone system...
.experts are still debating the possible cause of this latest interference.
Some believe it could be an extraterrestrial phenomenon.
Some say that only psychologists of the paranormal may solve this.
We are asking phone customers of
Virginia Beach for their patience...
.and apologize to all involved for the inconvenience.
It wasnt me.
What do you mean?
— What do you mean?
— Honest.
Why would you say something like that?
Would you please tell me whats going on?
— Promise you wont tell anybody?
— Of course.
Hes evil. He wont let me talk to Daddy.
Joey, well leave in half an hour.
How come you werent in school today?
Were going to see my aunt Jessica.
Thats too bad.
Too bad.
— He’s burying something.
— Yes, looks like it.
They’re leaving.
Hey, Charlie.
Charlie, where are you?
Hey, there you are.
Let me introduce you. This is Charlie.
Charlie, this is Sally.
What’s wrong with him?
Dont be such a chicken.
— Why is he chirping?
— Hes talking.
Don’t make things up.
But its true, Sally.
What do we have here?
Charlie.
What are you two doing there?
Charlie!
No!
— Charlie, move out of the way!
— Charlie, leave!
Get out of the way!
Oh, you animals!
Great shot!
— Who on earth is throwing bombs?
— It wasnt us. It was Joey.
How did you get in here?
Excuse me.
The door was open, the radio was on.
Joey wasnt in school today so I thought Id stop by.
Yes, he had a sore throat this morning, so I thought hed better stay in bed.
I just saw him in the yard with some kids.
What kids? Oh, what am I doing!
Use this. Some kids from his class.
— Did you think about my suggestion?
— What suggestion?
Consulting a child psychologist.
Please forgive me, but maybe we should talk about it another time...
What is this?
Please leave me and my son alone.
Well manage.
Do you really mean to say that Joey can communicate with the dead?
For him, his father isnt really dead.
But how does he talk to him?
He just uses a telephone.
What about the knives?
How did that happen?
Joey says the dummy did it.
I know it sounds silly, but he found it and brought it home.
He says it’s evil.
It doesnt want him to talk to his father and punishes him for playing the game.
Whatever that means.
Im not sure what he tried to say.
Lets go.
Wait a minute.
I know I put the dummy down here.
— The dummy?
— I found it outside.
Oh man, I’m dead meat! I just borrowed these. My brother is going to kill me.
— Why didn’t you wait?
— It would have made no difference.
One look and pow - they were gone!
How am I going to explain to my brother where his tanks are?
— Oh, start crying!
— You have it easy!
Maybe we should kidnap him.
Hey, come here, I found something!
Not so fast! Wait!
You really want to go in there?
Wait, I have a lighter.
— Hey, there’s a box of candles.
— Give me one.
— Look at this.
- Wow!
Looks like the ceiling is going to cave in.
Look, there’s an old jukebox.
Awesome, check if it’s still working.
There’s another one!
Joey, dinner is ready.
I hope it didnt scare you.
Tell him to leave it alone.
Joey, what kind of behavior is that?
I was just looking at it.
Martin, your plate please.
Hello?
— Your plate.
— Sorry.
What about you?
My God, did you see that?
Don’t let it ruin your appetite.
Well, Joey...
Joey, stop that and start eating.
Your mother and I think you should go back to school tomorrow.
What do you think?
— Joey, he asked you something.
— Im not going back to school.
You dont have to worry about the other kids.
I think the best thing would be, how should I put it...
• . if you keep your secrets to yourself.
What Martin and I are trying to say is...
• .enough of your tricks, okay?
Will you promise me that?
— Martin, dinner is getting cold.
— Yes.
What happened?
— He burned my hand.
—Joey, what have you done!
Come on, let’s put it in ice water.
No, no. Here, there.
— III get some ice.
— Are you sure it was Joey?
Who else?
I once read that such phenomena occur during puberty.
Puberty? Joey just turned nine.
She didnt keep it to herself.
Yes, and she said she wouldn’t tell anyone.
Why can’t they just leave me alone?
No, I don’t want to go to school anymore.
I hate them. I really hate them.
No, he isn’t nice, just stupid.
He treats me like a baby.
Really. I can take care of myself.
Okay, if you say so...
Joey?
Where are you?
Joey!
Theres no use hiding.
Mommy!
Mommy!
Mommy!
Mommy, Mommy, don’t go there!
Mommy!
I know youre here.
Laura, Laura, come quick!
What is this now?
I knew you were here.
Where are you?
I’m here, Mommy!
Laura, watch out!
I hate you! I want you to leave!
I never want to see you again!
You hear?
What do you want from me?
— A little game.
— I wont play with you.
— Well see.
— Daddy.
Yes, we’ll see...
Let me down!
Daddy, help me!
Daddy, Daddy!
Here, here.
— Help!
— What is it, Laura?
I hate you!
I hate you!
I hate you!
—Joey!
— Daddy help me!
—Joey!
— Stay away from the door!
Leave me alone!
— He has blocked the door.
— Joey, please open up!
Come on, open the door!
Calm down, III get help, I promise.
Things will be all right.
Keep going, keep going.. .stop!
Come on, come on.
Keep going...
Stop!
Hey, watch it!
— Do we have to go up there?
— To the house.
He cant drive in here!
Be careful with that lamp, give it to me please.
— Be careful!
— Watch out.
— Sorry, I’m a little nervous.
— Are you okay, Laura?
I dont know.
I try to save what I can.
— Look at that.
— Is this for real?
— All that for that little idiot?
— Thats unbelievable.
If he thinks he can get away with this, hes wrong.
He has to pay his dues.
We have to think of something quickly.
Hey, wait a minute!
Hold it, you can’t go in.
Joey, look around.
Everything will be set up here.
And those people over there are from the phone company.
Youve caused them a few sleepless nights lately...
Up there are colleagues of mine.
Theyll be taping everything when we do the tests.
Dr. Hayden.
— Whats going on here?
— You must be the boys teacher.
— Looks like the whole city is moving in.
— Dont worry.
We have experience in these matters.
The house is blocked off.
Have you noticed any changes in the boy recently?
— No, I can’t think of any.
— Scooter, get down.
— Any illnesses?
— No, not to my knowledge.
— Oh, yes. A cold.
— A cold? A cold.
— Are you ready?
— Yes.
Turtle to Eagle, am at observation post one, start distraction maneuver.
It worked. Let’s go.
I hope its not too uncomfortable, but it has to be, okay?
We will play a tape.
You will hear exactly what happened five nights ago at 8:45 pm.
Start the tape.
Turtle to Eagle, we are now at observation post two.
Hey what’s this?
Idiot, I’m not a trash can!
I dont think that was loud enough...
Who is this guy?
I’m telling you, he’s from the CIA.
— CIA... This joker?
— Careful!
The entire phone system was shut down...
.and the center of the interference was this house.
Joey, your mother told me you didnt talk to her again.
You may not believe me, but I have talked to people with the same gift.
People dont understand them.
Theyre afraid of them.
They find theyre different, strange, but theyre not really.
Theyre a rare treasure for everyone.
These people are proof that death as we know it doesnt exist.
When I walked through the house
I noticed something strange.
There were no toys to be found anywhere.
But your teacher told me great stories about them.
What happened?
I know about the dangers, but you can master them, if you recognize them.
Damn, they’re everywhere!
— You cant move the stand through this.
— What are they doing?
— Make a report.
— Okay.
Headquarters, come in. All is quiet.
We have reached our advanced watch post and will keep you informed -- over.
— What is this?
— Some interference in the line.
Come in, we’re facing an enemy spy...
— We dont have time for that, let her go.
— Okay, Sally, get lost.
We will try to get to the center of the enemy base.
We are not taking any prisoners.
Well fight to the bitter end.
Our one single objective is Joey Collins.
I will need to see courage and determination from everyone.
Now to our strategy.
Spiderman, youre in command of the left flank.
Robin and Golden Eagle, youre in command of the right.
My men and I will go straight through the center.
Any questions? Good.
— May the Force be with us.
— May the Force be with us.
Okay, I got it.
Were starting to get bored.
Hey, look who’s coming.
Headquarters, Joeys mother’s leaving the house.
Wait, the jerk of a teacher, too.
Laura!
— I am so hot!
— Stop whining!
— Mayday! Mayday! Theres Sally!
— Hey!
Hey, what are you doing there?
Attack!
Where are you going, girl?
Joey, theyre trying to capture you.
They can be here any minute.
Come on, we have to hurry!
Stay here!
Joey, do something!
— I cant.
— Why not?
Get them all!
Im begging you, Joey, do something!
Okay, but for the last time.
— What’s going on here?
— Where are they all going?
What do we have here?
Where are these kids coming from?
— Do something.
— Watch the equipment.
— How do you do it, Joey?
— I play the game.
Dr. Hayden, look!
Whack him!
What is this?
Mommy, Mommy!
I can understand why they ran away.
It was just too much.
— The boy needs you now, lets go.
— Yes.
When its all over you should take the boy on a short getaway.
Both of you need it.
I hope this all will be done then.
I will see to it.
But if his father isnt dead, is he some sort of ghost?
When you die, you’re not really dead.
The soul enters a new world.
If I’d say this at home, they’d think I’m nuts.
— I dont think so.
— Sorry, but he lost it.
Just wait II beat the crap out of you in no time.
Whats going on here?
— Tell us.
— I lost my teddy bear.
Joey, we would like to know if you are led by your feelings.
Come on, tell us!
Do you wish it or is it simply happening?
One moment. Ill be right with you.
— Tell us, what was it like?
— Why is the light always there?
— What’s you name?
— Leave him alone.
Don’t you see, he doesn’t want to talk.
— Why don’t you try it.
— Tell us your name.
What are all of you doing here?
Get out! Out! Move it!
Joey, is everything all right?
I shouldnt have left you alone.
What did they do to you?
Asking stupid questions.
Should I tell them to leave?
Good. III be right back.
— What is it?
— Hes gone.
We have to warn them.
— Im going home...
— Look, this is you.
Too bad, we can’t tell anybody.
Can you imagine how much they would pay for a story like this?
We all gave our word of honor, so let’s keep it.
— Mommy, Mommy, we’ll keep quiet!
— Wait you...
Knock him down! Get him!
We started the jukebox!
Look out!
Mommy! Help!
— Head for the stairs!
— Hurry up!
Come on, let’s get this door open!
— The kids need their rest.
— The kids are totally upset.
Maybe theres another staircase.
— You’re crazy! I’m not going!
— Then you can stay, fatso.
Wait!
Watch out, the ceiling caved in.
Do you see anything?
— So, what do we do now?
— We split up.
You two, come with me!
— Joey, we cant go in here!
— We have to.
Its a dead end.
Were never going to get out of here!
Wait for me!
— William, you won’t believe what I saw!
— Do you hear that?
I told you not to go in, now we’re in trouble.
Come on, calm down.
Oh, it’s you.
Did you find a way out?
No, just a big monster with yellow eyes.
Come on Sally, we have to find them.
— If we only knew where we are...
— I want to go home!
Lets keep looking!
Joey! Joey!
Joey!
Where are you?
My God, Martin, he must be somewhere!
Don’t worry, Laura.
It probably was too much for him,
I’m sure they’ll find him.
But I promised him I’d get rid of them all.
Come over here.
— Were now in the forest?
— Any sign?
— Not yet.
— Okay, keep looking.
Davis.
Go ahead.
We have several juveniles now missing from the area.
Try to calm them down.
III check here.
Take over, will you?
Mrs. Collins, we just got news that other children are missing.
Let’s go!
Were never going to get out of here, we’re all going to die.
Cut the crap! We’ll get out!
We have to find them!
Hey, be quiet. Do you hear that?
Come on, let’s get out of here.
Shut up! Who’s there?
How did you find us?
Show us the way out.
Theres no way out.
Whos got the dummy?
Look at that!
He hasnt got that much power.
— Dont you dare disturb him!
— I wont listen to you!
Please, help us getting out of here.
Tell him to leave us alone!
Joey, who are you talking to?
— Get lost! I told you to get lost!
— Shut up!
You have to help us, do you hear?
Do you understand me?
What are you doing here?
Who are you?
I have never seen you before.
He has trapped us here.
Help us get out.
I will not let you get out of here.
Thats a promise!
I dont need to help you.
You have a friend that will.
The door, can you see the door?
— Go now, don’t be afraid.
—Joey, don’t go!
— Hold him back!
— Joey, you cant go there!
Joey, dont go in there!
Daddy.
Joey, dont go!
Daddy.
Joey.
Joey, talk to us!
Theyve found the boy!
Theyve found the boy!
They found him!
Mrs. Collins, they found him.
Joey!
Joey, what happened?
I need a doctor.
Move the barricade, quick!
Make room, please.
Hows the blood pressure?
Ready for the EKG?
Wheres the probe?
Pulse?
Blood pressure?
Hurry up!
Oxygen!
Drip. Start the EKG.
— IV. ready?
— Do it.
Is the IV. ready?
Okay, Bernie, then what happened?
The whole ceiling caved in.
We tried to run, but we couldnt get out!
Why not?
Well, there were all these doors and a big monster with evil yellow eyes.
What did you see?
A Hamburger! It was at least as big as a mountain.
— A Hamburger?
— Maybe a Cheeseburger.
— Come on, what did you see?
— Okay, I saw him.
— Who did you see?
— Darth Vader.
— Will he get well?
— Sure he will, Sally.
Sally, tell me what happened.
I told him not to go in there.
But maybe he didnt want to stay here.
Why do you say that?
— The light was so beautiful.
— What light are you talking about?
It was like the sun going up.
Blood pressure 70/90.
— Atropine 5 mg, lets go!
—5 mg Atropine.
Hows the pulse?
No pulse!
Start CPR!
Hows the pulse?
No pulse.
Come on, Joey.
Come on, you’ll make it, ready?
YouII make it Joey, come on.
Dont let him give up!
— One, two three, four...
— Pulse?
Damn it!
Sorry, my little one.
Yes, she’s coming.
For you.
What is it?
Quiet, please.
The boy is dead.
May we see him?
I know we were mean to you, but we’re really sorry.
You would’ve made a darn good leader, if you’d still be with us.
I no longer need this.
Laura.
If you need me...
If theres anything I can do...
No.
III take care of Charlie. I promise.
You have to go now.
So, what do we do now?
Pack up our stuff and leave.
Leave, don’t you go in there!
I’m not afraid! Its only Joey.
Yes, you’re back!
Hes back!
Thank you. Hi.
I'd like to go to the Adelphi Hotel.
This is my cab.
I was here first!
Oh, God.
Let's go across. Come on.
We'll get one down the road. Hurry.
For God's sake, Harold, can we please get a taxi?
I'm trying to get a... Taxi!
We're going the wrong way!
Put that away. We look like tourists.
Let's cut over to Seventh.
- Seventh is that way.
- I know where we are!
Hey, give me a dollar.
How about it? One dollar.
Are you deaf? You don't speak English?
Come on! Up here.
Hey, lady...
...do the kid a favor. Don't scream.
Hey, all right!
American Express card.
"Don't leave home without it."
Get out of here.
I don't like it up here.
Are you scared of heights?
I don't know.
After what happened to Johnny Gobs...
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and took a walk off a roof. No big loss.
That ain't what I heard at all.
I heard that the Bat got him.
The Bat? Give me a break, will you?
Five stories. Straight down.
There wasn't no blood in the body.
No shit. It was all over the pavement.
- I'm getting out of here.
- Shut up. Listen to me.
There ain't no Bat.
You shouldn't have turned the gun on that kid.
You want your cut of this money or not?
Now shut up! Shut up!
Don't kill me!
Don't kill me!
Don't kill me! Don't kill me!
I won't kill you.
I want you to do me a favor.
Tell all your friends about me.
What are you?
I'm Batman.
Across this nation...
...the words "Gotham City" are synonymous with crime.
Our streets are overrun, our public officials are helpless.
As mayor, I promise to root out the source of this corruption...
...Boss Carl Grissom.
Now, our new District Attorney,
Harvey Dent...
...will carry out that promise.
Thank you, Mayor Borg. Thank you.
People of Gotham City...
...I'm a man of few words.
But those words will count, and so will my actions.
Commissioner Gordon informs me that he has targeted those businesses...
... suspected of fronting for
the syndicate in this city.
Before this week is out...
... we are going to knock down their doors...
... and shed the light of the law
on that nest of vipers.
Together, we can make this
city safe for decent people.
Decent people shouldn't live here.
They'd be happier someplace else.
Pretty tough talk about Carl.
Forget about it.
If this clown could touch Grissom,
I'd have handed him his lungs by now.
If Grissom knew about us...
...he might hand you something.
Don't flatter yourself, angel.
He's a tired old man.
He can't run this city without me.
And besides...
...he doesn't know.
You don't worry about anything, do you, Jack?
You look fine.
I didn't ask.
Yeah. Hanging on.
Let me guess.
Giant, menacing, supernatural form.
Kind of like a bat.
That's it. What are they seeing up there?
They're drinking Drano.
It's weird.
Thanks for the tip.
Christ. Knox.
Lieutenant, I hear we had another Bat attack.
That's eight sightings in a month.
I hear the Commissioner's opened a file.
Sorry, Knox.
These two slipped on a banana peel.
I'm telling you, a giant bat!
Don't write about this.
It will ruin your already useless reputation.
Lieutenant, every punk in this town is scared.
They say he can't be killed.
They say he drinks blood.
I say you're full of shit, Knox.
You can quote me on that.
Is there a six-foot bat in Gotham City?
Is he on the police payroll?
What's he pulling down, after taxes?
Brought you a little snack, Eckhardt.
- Why don't you broadcast it?
- Shut up and listen.
Harvey Dent has been sniffing around one of our front companies.
That's my territory.
If there's a problem, I deal with it.
Your problems are our problems.
I answer to Grissom, not to psychos.
You ought to think about the future.
You mean when you run the show?
You got no future.
You're an A-1 nut-boy, and Grissom knows it.
Better be sure.
See?
You can make a good decision when you try.
Where've you been spending your nights?
I don't care if this festival is in debt,
I want a parade.
I want hot dogs, balloons, everything.
We'll celebrate this 200th anniversary proudly and publicly.
We may celebrate in bankruptcy court.
It's $250,000 in debt and we haven't seen one balloon.
You fill the square with people, and businesses will come back.
A lot of people may stay away.
They're scared.
They won't be scared when you get Grissom in the courthouse.
I promised that, remember?
Welcome, Count Dracula.
Had any sightings of Big Foot lately?
- They buried your story on Batman.
- They bury garbage.
This is Pulitzer Prize stuff.
I got something for you.
Very funny. You should have put more gore under the fangs.
What a dick.
Hello, legs.
I'm reading your stuff.
Well, I'm reading yours.
Hi, I'm Vicki Vale.
Yeah, photographer. Vogue, Cosmo. Yeah.
If you want me to pose nude, you'll need a long lens.
Actually, I was in the Corto Maltese.
You could get hurt doing this stuff.
What brings you here?
I'm here to see the wildlife in Gotham City.
Wildlife? Like what?
Like... bats.
- Who sent you?
- Nobody, really.
I just loved your story, and...
...I like bats.
My pictures, your words.
Pulitzer Prize material. Just think.
Okay, you're a visionary, and also the only one who believes me.
I need something tangible.
Gordon's got a file.
I can't even get him on the phone.
He'll be at Bruce Wayne's benefit, right?
Yeah. I don't seem to be on the guest list.
No.
Yes, yes. Vale, will you marry me?
- No.
- Buy me lunch?
- Maybe.
- I eat light.
Say this...
...son of a bitch...
...makes a connection with us and with Axis Chemicals.
What kind of damage are we looking at?
If he ties us with Axis Chemicals, we're dead and buried.
We should move immediately.
I say we break into the place...
...trash the office...
...and make off with the records and say it was industrial espionage.
Smart thinking. That's the way to go.
In fact...
...I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
Me?
Would you mind waiting in the next room?
That's all, gentlemen. Thank you.
That's all.
Can somebody else do this?
The fumes in that place...
It's an important job. I need...
...someone I can trust.
You... are my number one guy.
Now...
...don't forget...
...your lucky deck.
My friend...
...your luck is about to change.
Police Department.
Get me Lieutenant Eckhardt.
Can I help you, sir?
- Good evening.
- A little crowded.
Could you tell me who is Bruce Wayne?
I'm not sure.
Thanks anyway.
Eight. I can make that eight.
I can make that eight.
Commissioner!
Mrs. Gordon, you look lovely.
Is it true the Commissioner has a file on the Batman?
There is no Bat. If there were, we would find and arrest him.
Be straight with me, Commissioner.
How're you making out?
Mr. Dent, I love that tie.
We were discussing winged vigilantes.
What's your stand?
We have enough problems in this city...
...without worrying about ghosts.
Pardon me, but that's not a denial.
Excuse me, I'll be back.
Won't anybody go on record?
- Your Honor, great suit.
- No comment.
What's up?
Anonymous tip.
Napier's cleaning out Axis Chemicals.
Why wasn't I told? Who's in charge?
- Eckhardt.
- Oh, my God!
Come on, let's go.
Mr. Gordon?
Mr. Gordon?
Wait, wait. Living room, dining room, arsenal.
Look at this stuff.
Who is this guy?
He gives to humanitarian causes, and then collects all this stuff.
He probably does it to get chicks.
They like his charity balls.
Don't leave out his very large bankroll.
The more they've got, the less they're worth.
This guy must be the most worthless guy in America.
Check this out. He must have been the King of the Wicker People.
Where'd this come from?
I have no idea.
It's Japanese.
How do you know?
I bought it in Japan.
- Who are you?
- Sorry. Bruce Wayne.
Alexander Knox.
I read your work. I like it a lot.
Thanks. Can I have a grant?
Vicki Vale.
Bruce Wayne.
Are you sure?
Yeah. I've seen your pictures from Corto Maltese, haven't I?
You've got a wonderful eye.
Some people think she has two.
This is an amazing house.
I'd like to shoot it sometime.
We need more champagne.
Is that all right?
Sure. Go ahead.
How many cases? Six? Six?
Six is good.
Will you be in Gotham for a while?
I'd love to. I'm intrigued by
Alex's "giant bat" stories.
Oh, right. The bat... Batman.
A bit light after the war in Corto Maltese, no?
What do you do for a living?
Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave.
Very unexpectedly, sir.
Will you two excuse me?
I think perhaps this way, sir.
They need wine in the front room, and a Mrs. Daley needs a copy of the menu.
And give Knox a grant.
Nice talking with you, Wayne.
The rich...
Know why they're so odd?
They can afford to be.
Look at this mirror.
Maybe it should be Bruce Vain.
- What's up?
- Anonymous tip.
Napier's cleaning out Axis Chemicals.
If we could get him, we'd have Grissom.
Why wasn't I told? Who's in charge?
- Eckhardt.
- Oh, my God!
Come on, let's go.
Get a good look.
Shoot to kill. You know what I mean?
Let's move out.
We've been ratted out, boys.
Watch it.
Freeze!
You take the right. Move it.
What the hell's going on?
- What are you trying to do?
- I'm in charge, not Carl Grissom.
This is Commissioner Gordon.
I want him taken alive.
I repeat. Any man who opens fire
on Jack Napier will answer to me.
Let me down!
Let me down!
Let me down!
Oh, my God!
Get up on the catwalk, on that side.
You take that side. Be very careful.
Jesus!
Let him go... or I'll do Gordon.
Nice outfit.
Come on, Jack, let's go!
Come on!
Eckhardt!
Think about the future.
Goddamn it, we had him!
Hold it right there!
- Who is this guy?
- I don't know.
Until we find out, keep a lid on it.
If there's no Bat, then who dropped Napier into the acid?
Suicide? I want to get this on tape.
He hung up. What have you got?
Here's the inner city.
Here's the sightings so far.
Maybe Batman has some sort of flight pattern.
This is very good. Tonight we'll go to dinner, then we'll walk the trail.
No can do. I got a date. Bruce Wayne.
Wayne! Wayne! Oh, no!
The guy's a stiff.
You could do much better.
Thanks for being so concerned.
How's the soup?
Excuse me?
The soup. How is it?
It's great.
Could you pass the salt?
Did you have trouble finding the house?
- It was no problem.
- Good.
Do you like eating in here?
I don't think I've been in this room before.
You want to leave?
Yes.
There was young Master Bruce...
...leading his gray pony with me on its back...
...like a sack of old potatoes, covered in mud and nursing a sprained ankle.
That was the first and last time
I gave him a riding lesson.
I think I've embarrassed him for long enough.
I'm off to bed.
Please, leave everything.
I'll tidy up in the morning.
He's really wonderful. He loves you a lot.
Alfred's great.
I couldn't find my socks without him.
He reminds me of my grandfather.
Were you close to him?
I used to spend summers with him and my grandmother.
They had a house on the lake.
Nothing like this, but...
...it was fun.
That sounds nice.
What about your family?
Actually, Alfred is my family.
This house and all this stuff doesn't seem like you at all.
Some of it is very much me.
Some isn't.
That dining room is definitely not you.
The dining room isn't.
Let's see how we did.
Oh, my God!
Mirror.
Mirror!
You understand that the nerves were completely severed.
You see what I have to work with here.
There are an awful lot of stairs in this place.
My feet are killing me.
I feel a little drunk.
And you're not anything.
One drink and I'm flying.
Why are you afraid of flying?
That you, sugar bumps?
Who are you?
It's me.
"Sugar bumps."
You're alive! I heard you'd been...
Fried?
Is that what you heard?
You set me up over a woman.
A woman!
You must be insane.
Don't bother.
Your life won't be worth spit!
I've been dead once already.
It's very liberating...
...if you think of it as... therapy.
Jack, listen.
Maybe we can cut a deal.
Jack?
Jack is dead, my friend.
You can call me...
...Joker.
As you can see...
...I'm a lot happier.
Oh, what a day.
Gotham City.
It always brings a smile to my face.
"Winged Freak...
"...Terrorizes..."
Wait'll they get a load of me.
I've got an idea. How about lunch at my place? I'll show you some photos.
Sure. Okay.
Wait a minute. No, I can't. I can't make it.
Okay, we'll do it later in the day.
I can't make it then, either.
I've got a very important meeting today.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I have to leave town for a few days.
Okay, we'll do it when you get back.
I have to go. I'm late.
- Nice to see you again.
- Nice to see you, too.
I'll talk to you guys when you get back.
Back, Miss Vale?
We'll be here for quite a while.
You'll never believe what happened to me today.
So, gentlemen, that's how it is.
Until Grissom... resurfaces...
... I'm the acting president.
And I say, starting with
this anniversary festival...
... we run this city into the ground.
Why don't we hear this from Grissom?
Yeah.
And what's with that stupid grin?
Life's been good to me.
What if we say "no"?
Nobody wants a war.
If we can't do business, we'll just shake hands and that'll be it.
Yeah?
I got a live one here.
There'll be a hot time in the old town tonight.
Antoine got a little hot under the collar.
You're crazy.
Haven't you ever heard of the healing power of laughter?
- Now get out of here!
- Let's go! Move it!
You think it over.
Go to the Globe, follow that reporter Knox.
Take your camera.
See what he knows about this Batman.
And, Bob...
...remember... you...
...are my number one... guy
Yes, sir.
Your pals...
...they're not bad people.
Maybe we...
...ought to give them a few days to think it over.
No?
Grease them now?
Okay.
You are a vicious bastard, Rotelli.
I'm glad you're dead.
I'm glad you're dead.
I'm glad you're dead.
I need that.
I'm losing confidence in you.
I thought we were a team.
Is this a personal issue for you?
I just want you to do your job.
I am doing my job.
And I'm protecting my partner.
There's nothing in these files.
Who is this guy?
Who cares?
Forget Bruce Wayne. I'm onto Batman.
They'll be out any second.
I can't wait to hear the explanation.
What is this affidavit you filed?
Grissom gave you his business?
Mr. Grissom asked me, as a personal favor...
...to take over all his businesses until he returns.
That's a big favor.
You two must have been very close.
Did you do time together as children?
Our accountants are looking into it.
The affidavit is legitimate.
I smell fresh ink. You can prove this?
Of course you can.
We have witnesses.
Grissom's signature is legitimate.
It is legitimate.
I saw it. I was there.
I saw it all.
He reached up with his dead hand...
...and signed it in his own blood.
And he did it... with this pen.
Hello, Vinnie. It's your uncle Bingo.
Time to pay the check.
The pen...
...is truly mightier than the sword.
Get down!
Won't this gang war dampen
the city's 200th anniversary?
The festival opens.
The police will stop these gangsters.
What about the theory that
the Batman is a Mob enforcer?
I don't have any comment.
Batman.
Batman.
Can somebody tell me what kind of a world we live in...
...when a man dressed as a bat...
...gets all my press?
This town needs an enema!
May I have a glass of... water?
I'm relieved that you're home.
Miss Vale telephoned.
She was rather concerned.
I feel there's a certain weight that lifts when she is here.
Alfred...
...why don't you marry her?
That's not exactly what I had in mind, sir.
I can't go on with that right now.
If not now...
...when?
I don't know.
Jack Napier's still alive.
He's running Grissom's men.
I need any information on him.
She is great, isn't she?
Yes.
Knox.
Check something out for me.
Find out what's special about the alley at Pearl and Phillips.
Pearl and Phillips?
You got it.
Mister Wayne.
So much to do and so little time.
The photos.
Who's that loss?
Knox.
Bad tie. No style.
Stop the press!
- Who is that?
- Vicki Vale.
The photographer working with Knox.
That girl has style.
Jesus marimba!
A lovely beast like that running around...
...could put steam in a man's strides.
She's dating some guy named Wayne.
She's about to trade up.
It's hard to stay inside the lines.
I'm about...
...to get a new girl.
I'm of a mind to make some mooky.
Phone book.
So much to do...
...and so little time.
Have you shipped a million of those?
Ship them all! We're going to take them out a whole new door!
Ten seconds to transmission.
Five... four... three... two... one.
Cue music.
Cue Becky.
Good evening.
The fashion world was stunned today...
...by the sudden deaths of models
Candy Walker and Amanda Keeler.
Cause of death has been attributed
to a violent allergic reaction...
... although authorities have not
ruled out the possibility of drug use.
Plans continue for the
city's 200th birthday...
... as Mayor Borg announced today,
the unveiling...
This just in.
Three mysterious deaths
at a beauty parlor...
... were discovered today.
What's going on?
This is hardly the...
Kill the camera.
This is Rene on the news floor.
I need paramedics up here now!
New and improved Joker products!
With a new secret ingredient.
Smylex!
What's that?
Let's go over...
... to our blind taste-test.
Love that Joker.
- Where's it coming from?
- I don't know.
He doesn't look happy.
He's been using brand X.
But with new Joker Brand...
... I get a grin again...
... and again.
That luscious tan...
... those ruby lips...
... and hair color so natural,
only your undertaker knows for sure.
You're saying:
"Where can I get these fine, new items?"
That's the gag. Chances are,
you've bought them already!
Love that Joker.
Remember...
... put on a happy face.
The information you requested.
"Jack Napier, assault with a deadly weapon, age 15.
"Results of psychological profile...
"...violent mood swings, highly intelligent, emotionally unstable.
"Aptitudes include science, chemistry, and art."
Chemistry.
Let's go shopping.
...six new deaths, with no clues as to the Joker's deadly weapon.
And what is the pattern?
Foods, alcohol, or beauty and hygiene products?
Cologne, mouthwash, underarm deodorant?
Or worse yet, there may be no pattern.
The search goes on through
Gotham's shopping nightmare.
We are having a festival, if I have to use a gun to get people there myself.
Do you hear the words coming from my mouth? The festival is on!
Find out what this madman is poisoning us with.
Do you read me?
We're working on it.
I need all the help I can get.
Hi, it's Vicki.
I'll be ten minutes late to the museum.
I'll see you when you get there.
A message from Miss Vale.
She'll be late meeting you at the museum.
Okay, thank you. Wait a minute, Alfred.
I'm not meeting her today.
Jack, where are you going?
Daddy's going to make some art, darling.
Mr. Wayne's table?
He hasn't arrived yet.
We have a table waiting.
Miss Vale, this just arrived for you.
Gentlemen!
Let's broaden our minds. Lawrence.
Give him a shave.
Terence, brush.
The one-dollar bill.
Hold it!
I kind of like this one. Leave it.
You can take that off now.
You're beautiful... in an old-fashioned kind of way.
But I'm sure we can make you more... today.
Your portfolio?
I'm meeting someone who wants to see my work.
Crap.
Crap. Crap.
Crap. Crap.
Now that's good work.
The skulls, the bodies.
You give it such a glow.
I don't know if it's art, but I like it.
Let me tell you what I'm thinking about.
I was in the bath one day...
...when I realized why I was destined for greatness.
You know how concerned people are about appearances.
This is attractive, that is not.
That is all behind me.
I now do what other people only dream.
I make art... until someone dies.
See?
I am the world's first fully-functioning homicidal artist.
What do you want?
My face on the one-dollar bill.
You're joking.
Do I look like I'm joking?
No.
Listen.
We mustn't compare ourselves to regular people. We're artists.
For instance, let me challenge you with a piece I did.
Bob. Alicia.
You will photograph and record my work.
You will join me in the avant-garde of the new aesthetic.
Jack, you said I could watch you improve the paintings.
I'm in trouble now.
Why is she wearing a mask?
She's just a sketch, really.
Alicia, sit down. Show the lady why you wear this mask.
Alicia's been made over in line with my new philosophy.
So now, like me...
...she is a living work of art.
I'm no Picasso, but... do you like it?
It's great.
So... what can I do for you?
A little song, a little dance.
Batman's head on a lance.
What do you know about...?
I don't know anything about Batman.
Really?
Well, how about a little "you and me"?
You're insane.
I thought I was a Pisces. Come on.
Let's make up. Have a little...
...whiff of my posy.
Help me!
I'm melting!
I'm melting! Help me! I'm melting!
Hold on.
Where does he get those wonderful toys?
- Get in the car.
- Which one?
Let's go.
Shields.
How much do you weigh?
About 108, I think.
Hold on.
Grab that thing on my belt.
Don't let go.
No blood.
Who is this guy?
Check his wallet.
- Wait.
- What is that?
Some kind of body armor.
He's human after all.
Take off the mask.
Shoot her!
Shields open.
You weigh more than 108.
- Really?
- Let's go.
Stop.
Where are we going?
Be careful.
Bats.
They're great survivors.
- What is all this?
- The police have got it wrong.
They're looking for one product.
The Joker's tainted hundreds of chemicals at the source.
Then whole shipments would be poisoned.
And we'd all be dead.
No.
The poison only works if the components are mixed. Hairspray won't do it alone.
But hairspray mixed with lipstick and perfume will be toxic, and traceable.
How did you figure this out?
Take that to the press.
I might have trouble with that.
A lot of people think you're as dangerous as the Joker.
He's psychotic.
Some people say the same thing about you.
What people?
Well, let's face it.
You're not exactly normal... are you?
It's not exactly a normal world.
Why did you bring me here?
You could have sent that stuff to the press yourself.
You're right.
There is something else you have that I want.
What?
He took the film.
Where have you been? Are you okay?
Should I come over?
No, Allie.
If I bring something to you, can we make the evening edition?
Just barely. Is it hot?
Yeah, it's real hot.
Copy!
Avoid the following combinations:
Deodorants with baby powder,
hairspray, and lipstick.
Safe products are flying in
as Gotham City goes on a forced fast.
And all of Gotham is wondering
what to make of Batman.
Friend or foe?
I have given a name to my pain...
...and it is Batman.
You must possess strength to inflict pain, Bob.
We've got a flying mouse to kill...
...and I want to clean my claws.
Sir, Miss Vale called again.
Dare I suggest that your
present course of action...
... might simply strengthen her resolve?
She is quite tenacious.
You're right.
And quite special.
Perhaps you could try telling her the truth.
Coming.
May I come in?
This is a nice apartment.
Lots of space.
Listen, I came over to...
...clear...
- I don't know who you think you are!
- You hurt me.
- I know.
I called you and called you. And you lied!
You lied about leaving town.
- Let me tell you why.
- Let me tell you!
I thought we felt something.
And I trusted you.
I even slept with you.
Then you wouldn't return my calls.
You must be some kind of jerk.
You're a real nice girl and I like you a lot, but right now, shut up.
I have something to tell you.
You know how people have... different sides to their personality?
Sometimes...
...a person will have to actually lead a different life.
Oh, my God, you're married.
No, I'm not married.
You see...
...my life is really...
...complex.
All right, listen. You know how a normal person gets up and...
...goes downstairs...
...and eats breakfast...
...and kisses somebody good-bye, and goes to...
...a job, and, you know...
No.
Look.
What I'm trying to tell you is...
Hey, it's okay.
You can tell me.
What I'm trying to tell you is...
I'll be right back.
Miss me?
Nice place you got here. Lots of space.
Vicki, we've really got to talk.
We were having dinner.
I was a man doing well with a beautiful woman.
And without so much as an apology...
...you ran off with that sideshow phony.
You know...
...I've recently had a tragedy in my life.
Alicia...
...threw herself out a window.
Oh, my God.
But...
...you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs.
Well, Miss Vale...
...another rooster in the hen-house?
Take thy beak from out my heart.
Bruce... Wayne, n'est-ce pas?
Most of the time.
I know who you are.
Let me tell you about this guy I know.
Mean kid. Bad seed. Hurt people.
I like him already.
You know what the problem was?
He got sloppy. You know, crazy.
He started to lose it.
He had a head full of bad wiring, I guess.
Couldn't keep it straight up here.
He was the kind of guy who...
...couldn't hear the train until it was two feet from him.
You know what happened to this guy?
He made mistakes.
Then he ended up with his lights out!
Now you want to get nuts?
Come on! Let's get nuts!
Tell me something.
Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?
What?
I always ask that of all my prey.
I just like the sound of it.
Never rub another man's rhubarb.
Why is it, every time I come for you...
...somebody always gets in the way?
I'll need a moment alone.
I'm only laughing on the outside.
My smile is just skin deep.
If you could see inside...
...I'm really crying.
You might join me for a weep.
You really wouldn't believe it.
While you were entertaining, I've been finding out about your street corner.
I think your friend is screwed up.
More good news.
Oh, my God!
His parents were murdered in that alley.
That's why he went there.
He watched it happen in front of him.
Look at the look on his face.
It was the same at City Hall.
What do you suppose this does to a kid?
Don't get personal!
Did you get the file on my parents?
It's on your table.
What's on your mind?
I have no wish to fill my few remaining years...
...grieving for the loss of old friends...
...or their sons.
The 200th anniversary birthday gala
has been indefinitely postponed.
We cannot guarantee public safety.
Joker here.
We got interference.
Now you fellows have said
some pretty mean things.
Some of which were true under that fiend...
... Boss Grissom.
He was a thief... and a terrorist.
On the other hand,
he had a tremendous singing voice.
He's dead now, and he's left me in charge.
I can be theatrical...
... and maybe even a little rough.
But one thing I am not...
... is a killer!
I love a good party.
So, truce.
Commence au festival!
And I've got a surprise for Gotham City.
At midnight, I will dump
20 million in cash...
... on the crowd.
Don't worry about me. I've got enough.
We are not prepared to discuss any deals.
You heard it, folks, 20 million.
And there will be entertainment.
The big dukeroo. With me in one corner,
and in the other corner...
... the man who has brought
real terror to Gotham City...
... Batman.
Can you hear me?
Just the two of us.
Mano y mano.
I have taken off my make-up.
Let's see...
... if you can take off yours.
Tell me, kid.
Have you ever danced with the devil by the pale moonlight?
Let's go!
Let's go, Jack!
See you around.
Am I crazy?
That wasn't just another night for either of us, was it?
We both got to each other, didn't we?
Why won't you let me in?
You got in.
I've loved you since I met you.
But I don't know what to think of all this.
Sometimes I don't know, either.
It's just something I have to do.
Why?
Because nobody else can.
I tried to avoid all this, but I can't.
This is how it is.
It's not a perfect world.
It doesn't have to be a perfect world.
I just have to know, are we going to try to love each other?
I'd like to.
But he's out there right now.
And I've got to go to work.
Into the air, Junior Birdman!
Miss me?
Yeah! Watch me!
Get them. Take the pictures.
Gotham's greed.
And now, folks...
... it's time for, "Who Do You Trust?"
Money, money! Who do you trust?
Me? I'm giving away free money.
And where... is the Batman?
He's at home, washing his tights.
Winged battle flies through the night and finds me ready.
Bob. Mask.
Masks! Put them on now!
And now...
... comes the part...
... where I relieve you, the little people...
... of the burden... of your failed...
... and useless lives.
But, as my plastic surgeon always said,
"If you've got to go...
"...go with a smile."
My God.
Smylex gas.
He's going to kill everybody!
Get in the car. Get in the car!
Hurry!
My balloons!
They're my balloons!
He stole my balloons!
Why didn't somebody tell me he had one of those... things?
Bob. Gun.
I'll need a minute or two alone, boys.
Get out of here!
Come on, you gruesome son of a bitch.
Come to me.
Darling.
I've got to get you to the church on time.
Gotham City Cathedral.
Transportation for two.
- Right away, sir?
- Five minutes.
Better make it ten.
Let's go.
Point those searchlights at the tower.
Now! Move!
It can be truly said that
I have a bat in my belfry.
Shall we dance?
You know, without you...
...I just wouldn't want to go on.
We were made for each other.
Beauty and the Beast.
Of course, if anyone calls you "Beast"...
...I'll rip their lungs out.
Mr. Joker?
You say such beautiful things.
And you're so powerful. And purple!
I love purple!
Excuse me.
Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?
I'm going to kill you.
You idiot!
You made me, remember?
You dropped me into the chemicals!
That wasn't easy to get over!
And don't think I didn't try.
I know you did.
You killed my parents.
What?
What are you saying?
I made you, but you made me first.
I was just a kid.
I say you made me, you say I made you.
How childish can you get?
You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses on?
What are you laughing at?
Let me lend you a hand.
Lend you a hand!
They don't make them like they used to!
Hey, Batsy!
There he is! Down there!
It's time to retire.
Feel free to drop in.
Sometimes I just kill myself!
Hold on!
Our police have rounded up
all of the Joker's men.
The reign of crime is over.
Public safety in Gotham City is
no longer a laughing matter.
- Aren't you covering the press conference?
- No.
What about our Pulitzer Prize?
What about us?
What about your picture of Batman?
Take care.
We received a letter from Batman.
"Please inform the citizens of Gotham...
"...that Gotham City's
earned a rest from crime.
"But if the forces of evil should rise again...
"...to cast a shadow on
the heart of the city...
"...call me."
Question. How do we call him?
He gave us a signal.
I thought champagne would be in order, ma'am.
Hi, Alfred.
Mr. Wayne told me to tell you...
...that he might be a little late.
I'm not a bit surprised.
Go on, do your prayers, Eddie. Go on.
God bless Mama and Daddy and the farm. Amen.
- Mama.
- Mmm-hmm?
- What's wrong with Daddy tonight?
- Nothing, Eddie.
You mind me and you go right to sleep, you hear?
Will it be all right?
Should I be afraid?
Tom Harley. Open up, Tom.
It's me, Clayton Heller. Tom.
Please open the door.
For God's sakes, Tom.
Open up, please!
It's after me, Tom.
It's gonna get me.
God in heaven, Tom.
We can't just sit here.
We have to, Ellie. This has nothing to do with us.
What kind of a Christian are you, for God's sakes?
- You got to help me, Harley!
- Tom.
- Mama.
- See to the boy.
Tom, it's gonna get me if you don't open the door!
For God's sake, please help me! Tom.
Why doesn't Daddy let the man in?
- Please open the door!
- He can't, baby. He just can't.
Get away from my door.
- Get away from me and my family!
- Tom, please!
You got to help me, Tom.
It's coming. I didn't kill that girl.
I don't know nothing about that, and I don't want to.
They said I did, Tom. But I didn't.
Now, I'm sorry. I am. But I can't risk my family for you, Clayton.
Now, I got my shotgun here.
Get away. Get away afore I have to use it.
Gypsy, ready? Ready?
Pick it up. Come here. Come on.
All right, ready? Go get it.
Come on.
Now, young man, come up here.
- I thank you. What've you been doing?
- Playing with Gypsy.
Mmm-hmm.
That's good.
You know something?
When I was your age, your great-grandmama used to wash my hands.
And she was so old that the skin on her hands was thin as tissue paper.
It felt so good.
Guess what?
Last one in the house will get the privilege of washing the breakfast dishes.
Get out of town.
Come on, Gypsy.
- Not at the table, Billy.
- But he's awful hungry, Daddy.
Put it in the bowl.
- Is it story time?
- I reckon.
Wait. I got to get something.
- Daddy?
- Hold on.
- I made you a present.
- You did?
I like presents.
Oh, well. Now, this is something.
It goes around your neck.
This is something special.
- You really like it?
- I love it.
You don't have to wear it every day or nothing. Just when it strikes you.
Give me a hug. I ain't never taking it off, punk.
All right, now, wait a minute.
Once upon a time, there was this scruffy old man, and you know, he was one of them yes-and-no kind of guys.
So anyhow, he was very proud
'cause he had this very clever son, and he knew that one day, this son was gonna grow up to be something very special.
So, and one day...
Really, Tracy. You know, Joel is a great guy once you get to know him.
Honey, get me a beer.
So how much further is it to the cabin, Steve?
About 50 miles.
Why do you always have to carry that stupid rifle with you?
'Cause you never know what you're gonna find in the jungle, yo.
- Sorry.
- Thank you, klutz.
Okay, come on.
- Let her rip.
- Now?
Get the potatoes, kid.
Sweet potatoes.
Come on, get it over there.
- Wait, Steve, pull over.
- What?
- I want to take a picture of this.
- These people can get pretty weird, Trace.
We heard a story a couple years ago about a guy who killed his wife and ate her just to get rid of the evidence.
- Yeah.
- That's disgusting.
No, the cops found, like, her foot or something in this big pot with all these carrots and onions.
It was like foot stew.
You know, I think this was the guy, too.
This was the guy.
Get a few more of these. Here you go.
Get a few more of them, boy.
All right, here we are.
- Where?
- Downtown Bradley Mountain.
Cabin's the next stop.
Just a few miles from here.
- Kimbo.
- Yeah?
Help me out.
This is your last chance to shop, lady.
Breathe deep. The air is clean.
- You guys are animals.
- Civilization is behind us.
No, Gypsy!
- Hook shot.
- No, Gypsy.
- Whoa! Nice dog.
- No.
Gypsy!
Made a friend there already, huh, Joel?
Gypsy, no.
Check out this kid's glasses.
We're talking Coke bottles.
Jesus.
- What? All I said was...
- We heard you, man.
Come on, Scratch. Let's do it.
- What's your name?
- Billy. This is my dog Gypsy.
Hey, Gypsy. How're you doing?
Hey, Gypsy.
Come on. I thought we were gonna get everyone settled in first.
Listen. If you want to stay here and play with the vegetables, that's fine with me.
I'm going.
Fetch, boy. Go get it.
- Come on, Gypsy. Come on. Come on.
- Yeah. Good dog. That a boy, Gypsy.
Come on.
Come on, Joe.
- Come on, Jimmy Joe.
- Shut up.
- You shut up.
- Stop it.
You young ones just stay put now, you hear?
Yes, sir.
- What's that?
- It's a camera, stupid.
Yeah, it's my camera. See?
Hey, can I take your picture?
There you go.
Good afternoon, Mr. Wallace.
What do you know today?
No more than I did yesterday.
Honey. Honey.
- Do you have any beer, sir?
- No. No liquor.
- Hessie, look.
- What?
Jimmy Joe, you give that here.
Jimmy Joe gots the ball and won't give it up.
Give it here. Give it.
Come on. Give it.
Jimmy Joe, you done bad.
Y'all know what settles on bad ones, don't you?
- Pumpkinhead.
- Pumpkinhead.
Y'all stop.
There ain't no Pumpkinhead.
- What about old Mr. Foley?
- He moved away.
Uh-uh.
Pumpkinhead got him.
Teared off his head and drank all the blood.
- Did not.
- Did too.
Shut up, Hessie!
"Keep away from Pumpkinhead
Unless you're tired of living
"His enemies are mostly dead
He's mean and unforgiving"
Stop it!
- Stop it!
- "Bolted doors and windows barred
- "Guard dogs prowling in the yard"
- Pumpkinhead. Pumpkinhead.
"Won't protect you till you're dead
"Nothing will, from Pumpkinhead
So keep away from Pumpkinhead"
- Stop it!
- Stop it!
I mean, well, you've got him pretty scared.
- Pumpkinhead.
- All right.
Get in the truck. Come on.
Hey.
Come on.
Here you go, Billy.
I was just about to say something myself.
- That'll do it for you, Mr. Wallace?
- That and my feed.
Damn, I left it up at the house.
Give me a couple of minutes. Will you?
I ain't got it. I'm due back now.
Suppose I drop it off right at your door? How'd that be?
Be there before dark.
Billy, bring Gypsy inside out of the sun for a while.
Yes, Daddy.
- Got to admit, he's pretty good.
- He's a jerk.
Yeah, but he's a talented jerk.
Nah.
He's just a jerk jerk.
Billy, I want you to stay right here and mind things, okay?
I got to fetch something up at the house.
- Yes, sir, Daddy.
- Then we'll take us a little ride.
Do you have to encourage him?
Maggie, he's my brother.
Be a good boy, now.
- You man enough?
- Go for it!
Gypsy, no.
Little boy?
- Are you okay?
- Little boy?
What?
Gypsy!
No!
Jesus.
- Don't move him.
- He just came out of nowhere.
- Is he all right?
- He's cold.
It's gonna be okay, Billy.
All right, keep him warm.
Keep him warm.
- It's gonna be okay, little boy.
- Oh, God.
- Hey! Stay here.
- We got to do something.
You're gonna be fine.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
We stay, I'm fucked, man.
Is that what you want?
It was an accident.
I almost hit him myself.
Yeah, but I've been drinking.
They'll fry me.
You got to help me, Scratch.
- Call an ambulance.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hurry!
- What are you doing? What are you doing?
- Get in the car.
- Get in the car. Get in the fucking car.
- No, we can't just leave him.
Damn it.
Joel, get back here!
Where the fuck is he going?
- Forget Joel.
- Forget... Fuck.
It'll be fine.
Everything's gonna be okay.
- Come on.
- Chris, did you get through?
- No phone.
- What about that guy at the stand?
He's gone, he's gone, he's gone!
Oh, God. Get to the cabin.
There's a phone over there.
It's all right. Chris.
Take care of her...
- and I'll stay with the kid.
- Yeah.
Go help Chris with Maggie, and I'll stay with the kid.
- Are you sure?
- I'll stay with him. Go! Go!
It's okay, Maggie. It's okay.
Go.
Billy?
Billy?
Gypsy.
Billy.
Gypsy.
Billy. Billy, Daddy's here.
It's okay.
Nobody saw him. It was an accident. Can I help?
- Okay, Maggie, come on.
- Come on, Maggie.
Maggie, come on. Listen. Just get up to the cabin and get on that phone.
I'm right behind you.
- I just stay on this trail?
- Yes, stay on the trail.
Did you call for help?
Jesus. This is crazy.
Damn you!
Jesus, he just ripped the phone cord out of the wall.
What?
I'm going back. I'm gonna drive to the nearest town.
You're not going anywhere.
- Hey!
- Hey!
What's up, man?
Chris, please.
Joel was in another accident a couple of months ago and a girl was hurt.
He's on probation right now.
If the police find out about it,
- he could go to jail.
- They're not gonna find out about it.
Look, man, I'm real sorry about that, but that little boy down there needs our help now.
Joel, just give me the keys, all right?
- You okay?
- Yeah. Go.
He wouldn't stop.
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.
Once upon a time, there was this old man, and he had a very, very special son.
- Daddy.
- Yeah, baby?
- Hey, are you okay?
- Steve! Steve!
Hey, Steve, let us out, man!
We're in here!
Oh, man. I just don't believe this.
I'm not going to jail for a fucking accident.
- Come on, Steve! Damn it!
- Come on!
Just look, the kid's father showed up.
He took the kid away.
Now, I think everything's gonna be okay.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Did you tell him what happened?
- I told him it was an accident.
- And?
- And he just looked at me.
- What do you mean, he just looked at you?
- I don't know.
Don't lie to me!
He looked at me like he wanted to kill me.
Looking for your pa.
- Hey! Bunt!
- Sir?
- Fetch your grandpa.
- Okay.
Grandpa, Pa wants you.
Mr. Harley's outside with the feed.
You go on out and unload the feed. I'll be out directly.
- Here's what I owe you.
- Keep it if you can help me.
I'm looking for an old woman.
She lives somewhere in the mountains hereabouts.
Some folkses say as how she's got powers.
I never heared of no such woman.
Mr. Wallace. Please.
I can't tell you what I don't know.
- Bunt.
- Sir?
- Get over by the house.
- But you told me to do this first.
You do what I told you, boy, and you do it now.
Okay.
- What killed him?
- City folks run him over.
- Left him.
- I'm sorry about your boy.
You got to tell me. She's the only one that can help him.
- Like I said, I'm sorry.
- You got to tell me, God damn it!
She can't help him. All she can do is take you straight to hell.
Now, you go on home. You go home and you bury your boy.
Hold it!
Mr. Harley, I heard you talking to my grandpa.
I know who you're looking for.
- What's your trade?
- What?
Her name's Haggis.
She's up on Black Ridge.
Get in back.
No way.
You got to show me. Get in back.
Okay, but I'm only going part way.
That old woman scares the piss out of me.
Stop it! Stop the truck! Stop!
This is as far as I go.
You keep on straight.
Follow this road till you can't no more.
You come to a cabin, that's her.
Who are you?
Ed Harley. I thought...
Afraid raising the dead ain't within my power.
This is...
This is all I got.
This is everything.
Nothing I can do for him.
- When I was young...
- I said, there's nothing I can do.
- I saw it.
- What?
What do you want, Ed Harley?
Say it.
Say it! Say it!
When I was young, folks used to talk about you.
Said as how you knew things.
Said if a man had been wronged, he could come to you and you'd called upon this thing in that man's name, and that man, he'd be avenged.
What you're asking got a powerful price.
They killed my boy.
They run him over and they left him.
Ever hear of Razorback Hollow?
There's an old graveyard way back deep in them woods.
Mountain folk used to bury kin in there, kin they's ashamed of.
Bring a shovel.
The thing you're looking for is in there.
Bring it back here.
Some things I got to do to it before it'll be any use to you.
- That graveyard... How will I know...
- You'll know, Ed Harley.
You'll know.
Leave the boy.
God.
When we get out of here,
Joel's gonna be carrying his balls home in a knapsack.
Remind me never to piss you off, Tracy.
I'll tell them it was my fault, that it was my bike that hit him.
The worst they're gonna give me is a slap on the wrist.
No.
Look, I'm really starting to worry about Maggie.
Bring it here.
- What is it?
- It's what you wanted, Ed Harley.
For each of man's evils, a special demon exists.
You're looking at vengeance, cruel, devious, pure-as-venom vengeance.
Give me your hand.
You can go now, Ed Harley.
Now it begins.
What'd you do, Daddy?
Well, fuck it. Let's just kidnap
Chris and Tracy and go to Mexico.
Guys.
You got to do the right thing, and you got to do it now.
They killed our boy, Lynn, honey.
Now they're gonna pay.
Maggie.
Here. Look.
Look, Maggie. Look at it.
You always found your strength from this.
Well, find it now and come back.
I need you.
Steve. Steve.
Yeah.
It's okay. I'm sure the boy's gonna be fine.
I'm sure his father's taking care of everything.
Steve! No!
Help! Steve! No!
I'm always fucking up.
My whole life, one big fuck-up.
But it stops now.
- Help me! Help me!
- Maggie!
- Maggie, what happened?
- It's killing him!
Lock the door.
Steve!
If those scum hurt my brother,
I'll rip their fucking hearts out. Steve!
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee...
Maggie, whatever you saw out there, it wasn't the devil.
It was!
- There is no such thing.
- There is! I saw it!
Oh, man, be okay, Steve. Be okay.
We're gonna find him, man.
They should be okay, right? I mean, they took the gun and everything.
God is the only thing that can stop what's out there, Kim.
Just in case God doesn't show.
Oh, God, Steve.
Cabin, man! Come on!
Jesus.
- Joel!
- You all right?
- There was something at the window.
- What about Steve?
We couldn't find him.
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.
We've got to get the hell out of here.
We're not going anywhere without Steve.
- Maggie, we don't know what's out there.
- Steve is out there.
She's right. Now, come on.
We're gonna find him.
Maggie, wait!
- Here, help me!
- Maggie!
Tracy!
- Maggie! Maggie!
- God damn it! Tracy! Wait!
- Maggie! Maggie!
- Did you see something?
- I saw something. I don't know what...
- Just stay close, okay?
It'll pass, Ed Harley.
- Let it finish.
- No, you got to stop it.
It's what you wanted.
No! Not like this! Not like this!
I see it. This is wrong.
Nothing I can do.
It's got to run its course now.
What did you think? It'd be easy, neat and clean and painless?
- You're a fool.
- If you won't help me...
If you don't help me, then I'll do it myself.
I'll do it, I'll do it myself.
You'll fail, Ed Harley.
You'll fail and you'll die, too.
Then I'll die. Then I'll die!
And pay the final price all the sooner.
God damn you. God damn you.
He already has, son.
He already has.
Maggie!
No! No!
I'm the one you want!
No!
No!
No!
- Oh, my God, Joel. What's wrong?
- It's got Kim.
- What's got her?
- It's a thing.
- What thing, man?
- It's a thing! I don't know! It's a thing!
- Kim! Kim! Kim!
- Come on, man. Come on, man.
Tracy, come on!
Kim! Kim!
- Joel!
- Oh, my God.
Kim!
- No.
- No!
No!
Joel, come on. We got to move, man.
Come on!
Help us!
- Hello?
- Why is this happening?
- I don't know!
- We got to move. Let's go.
- Help! Somebody help us!
- Help!
Help us!
Anybody in there, please?
There's something after us.
Please!
Where's Steve at?
Please!
Don't be mad.
- I'm cold.
- Come on.
Steve's dead.
Come on, man.
Come on.
Come on.
Tracy.
Shit. It's locked.
Okay, just get back.
Empty your hands, son.
Get away from here.
- Go on. Get.
- Look, mister.
We got something chasing us.
We just want to use your truck, okay?
- Please.
- Get off my land.
Don't make me have to shoot you.
- Please. We just need your help.
- I can't help you.
You folks is marked.
Marked? What do you mean, marked?
Joel. Joel, no. No, Joel, you don't know if it's dead!
It's dead.
Joel!
Come on.
- Come on.
- What is it?
I don't know! But whatever it is, it's not gonna get us. Do you hear me?
It's not gonna get us! There must be somebody that can help us!
Come on!
Bunt, get away from that window.
Grandpa, you sure that thing ain't gonna hurt the animals?
It only kills what it was called upon to kill.
Them, and whatever gets in its way.
Our animals will be fine.
You get away from that window, and you get to bed.
Help! Help us!
Get to bed like I told you. Now.
For God's sake, please.
Help us! Come on, man! Let us in.
Damn.
- Bunt?
- Go back to sleep, Hessie.
- What you doing?
- Nothing.
Okay.
If I tell you, you got to promise not to tell nobody. Not a soul.
- I won't.
- Cross your heart.
- Now swear.
- I swear.
Spit.
I'm gonna help those folks, Hessie. I got to find out if it's real or just a story.
Grandpa will whip you good if he finds out.
He ain't gonna find out.
Be careful.
Of course I'm gonna be careful.
Hey.
Shh.
Come on.
- It's you.
- Did you get a look at it?
- What's it look like? Is it big?
- Who are you?
- Man, what's going on?
- I'm trying to help you, for Christ's sake.
My name's Bunt. I live in this house here.
How come nobody answered the door? Didn't they hear us?
They can hear you.
They ain't allowed to help.
They ain't allowed to let you in.
They can't get involved.
- What do you mean, man?
- A man back there said we were marked.
We can't talk about this here. Come on.
I know a place that might be safe.
Come on.
I know where we can go.
Come on. Come on.
Ain't it neat?
About 40 years ago, they tried to start a congregation up around here.
Didn't work out, I guess.
I figure it's a holy place, so it might not like it here.
Come on.
Come on. Watch out.
Bunt. What do you know about that thing that's after us?
It's some kind of demon.
Before tonight I didn't believe it.
I thought it was just something that they made up to scare the little kids.
But when the sun went down, my grandpa fetched the whole family together.
And he told us that some outsider folks had done something real bad.
He wouldn't say what. He just said that Pumpkinhead was gonna be out after them, and that we better stay inside till he got them.
- Pumpkinhead?
- That's what it's called,
'cause it comes from the old pumpkin patch graveyard.
- Well, do you know why it's after us?
- No, ma'am.
But you must have done something bad.
See, according to the legend, if one man does something bad to another man, it's got to be something real bad, something like killing...
Then that other man can have Pumpkinhead conjured up to take revenge.
The kid at the stand.
What? What?
There was an accident earlier.
One of our friends hit a little boy with a motorcycle.
Where?
At the fruit stand a couple of miles down the road.
Gosh almighty. Billy Harley.
You know? You heard about it?
I took his...
I saw his pa, Mr. Harley, this afternoon.
I took him somewhere.
- Well, was his son okay?
- I can't say for sure.
But if that thing's hunting you,
I suppose not.
Oh, my God.
- Your friends, where are they now?
- They're dead.
Do you know the spot on Bradley Mountain
- where people park their cars?
- Yes.
- Can you take us there?
- Uh-huh.
I think it's here now.
Go!
Go! Move it!
Wallace! Wallace! Open up!
Wallace, open up! Wallace!
We got to stop it!
We got to stop it, or it's going to kill them all.
Open up or I'll blow the goddamn thing off the hinges.
Lose it, Harley.
You get away from here.
Get away from me and my kin.
This way.
Stay here.
- No.
- Stay here.
Chris!
Chris.
Chris.
Come on. Please.
Come on.
Ma'am, you got to get up.
Come on. We got to go.
Please. We can't stop it. No one can.
Somebody can.
- Mr. Harley.
- Come with me.
Mr. Harley, it's Pumpkinhead. It's real.
Now.
Come on.
Get in.
Get in the house.
Do you wanna live?
You Okay?
Yeah.
Thanks to you.
I'm gonna go outside and talk to Mr. Harley.
I want you to stay here.
Mmm-hmm.
Mr. Harley?
Mr. Harley.
It was an accident.
He's dead.
Nobody saw him until it was too late.
Can't you stop this?
Can't you call it off?
Nothing can call it off.
But I'm gonna send it back to whatever hell it come from.
You old dog.
Mr. Harley?
Mr. Harley, are you okay?
Chris.
Kill me.

DON'T YOU THINK
SHE'S A LITTLE
TOO YOUNG FOR YOU ?
LOOK, I'D GO OUT
WITH WOMEN MY AGE,
BUT THERE ARE
NO WOMEN MY AGE.
[ Groans ]
I THINK
YOU BETTER FIND ONE.
DO YOU WANT YOUR MOTHER
TO DO THAT ?
IS THIS A CLIP-ON ?
GOD, DON'T LET
YOUR GRANDFATHER SEE IT.
WHERE DID YOU
GET THIS ?
IT'S ONE OF DAD'S.
GRANDPA, I JUST WANT
TO SAY THAT...
WHEN I'M YOUR AGE...
I HOPE I'M HALF
AS LIVELY AS YOU ARE.
DON'T LOOK TO THE FUTURE, KID.
YOU'RE HALF AS LIVELY NOW.
IS THAT A CLIP-ON ?
YOU HEARD HIM:
"GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT."
HE JUST MEANT HE WAS GLAD
WE COULD MAKE IT TO THE PARTY.
YOU UNDERESTIMATE HIM.
THE MAN IS OBSESSED
WITH SEX.
WHEN HE SAYS,
"GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT,"
IT'S A SEXUAL BARB.
YEAH.
HELLO, DAVID.
GREAT PARTY, HUH ?
YOUR GRANDPA
DESERVES THE BEST.
LIKE ME.
I'M THE BEST.
[ Sighs ]
HE'S QUITE A GUY.
AH, YES, HE IS
REMARKABLE.
BUT, DAVID,
THERE IS SUCH
A GREAT DIFFERENCE
IN OUR AGES, YOU KNOW.
THAT'S TRUE, BUT--
BUT HOW COULD YOU
POSSIBLY KNOW...
UNLESS YOU'VE BEEN
WITH AN OLDER WOMAN ?
HAVE YOU ?
UH--
THEN AGAIN,
YOU AND I AREN'T THAT
FAR APART, ARE WE ?
IN AGE, I MEAN.
[ Sighs ]
IT'S A SEXY TIE.
IS IT A CLIP-ON ?
UH,  YES,
I-I BELIEVE SO.
DO I MAKE YOU NERVOUS,
DAVID ?
I HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.
OH, THERE YOU ARE.
HOW ARE YOU TWO
GETTING ALONG ?
[ Sighs ]
FAMOUSLY.
COME ON, DAVID.
THERE'S SOME PEOPLE
I WANT YOU TO MEET.
[ Madelyn ]
LATER, DAVID.
GENTLEMEN, YOU KNOW
MY GRANDSON DAVID.
HE'S A FRESHMAN,
LAMBDA CHI DELTA
AT ROSSMORE.
GOOD TO KNOW YOU.
THAT'S SOME GRIP.
YOU PLAY FOOTBALL ?
TRACK.  TRACK.
JUST LIKE ME.
NOT EXACTLY LIKE ME,
BUT TRACK.
YOU MUST DO PRETTY WELL
WITH THE GIRLS.
HE'S A WATSON,
A WATSON.
I BET HE'S BEATING THEM OFF
WITH A STICK.
- YEAH, THEY ACT LIKE I AM.
- WHAT'D YOU SAY ?
HE SAID, "YOU BETTER
BELIEVE I AM."
IS THAT WHAT HE SAID ?
I DIDN'T HEAR IT.
I JUST HEARD HIM.
SAY IT.  "YOU BETTER
BELIEVE I AM."
YOU BETTER BELIEVE I AM.
YEAH, HE SAID IT.

BECAUSE I HAD THAT MUCH FUN.
DAVID, COME UP HERE
AND HELP YOUR GRANDFATHER.
COME ON, KID.
GIVE ME A HUG.
[ David ]
THANKS FOR LETTING ME
DRIVE THE ROLLS, GRANDPA.
[ Jack ]
YOU'RE WELCOME, KID.
YOU HUNGRY ?
UH, NAH, NOT REALLY.
THERE WAS ALL THAT
GOOD FOOD AT THE PARTY.
DON'T TELL ME YOU ATE
ANY OF THAT STUFF.
NO.
GOOD.  WE'LL GO
TO KELLERS.
OKAY.
- WHERE IS IT ?
- IT'S IN ALTOONA.
"WHERE IS IT ?"
KEEP DRIVING, KID.
- WHERE'S ALTOONA ?
- RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO KELLERS.
"WHERE'S
 ALTOONA ?"
[ Laughs ]
TELL ME,
WHAT'S SCHOOL LIKE ?
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY ?
 IT'S OKAY ?
IT SHOULD BE
THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE.
I KNOW.
WHAT ABOUT--
 WHAT ABOUT GIRLS ?
YOU'LL NEVER AGAIN
HAVE AS WIDE A SELECTION.
TRUST ME.
THERE IS ONE.
ONE IS ENOUGH FOR STARTERS.
WHAT'S HER NAME ?
ROBIN.
WHAT'S SHE LIKE ?
SHE'S GREAT.  SHE'S SMART.
 SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.
TELL ME SHE'S GOT MONEY
AND I'LL BOOK A CHURCH.
I DON'T KNOW.
WE HAVEN'T SAID MUCH
TO EACH OTHER.
WHAT, IS SHE A MIME ?
TALKING TO WOMEN
IS NO BIG DEAL.
HERE, WATCH.
- [ Woman ]  MORE COFFEE ?
 - PLEASE.  "RITA."
IS THAT YOUR NAME,
OR ARE YOU WEARING
SOMEBODY ELSE'S CLOTHES ?
[ Laughs ]
THAT'S MY NAME.
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING ELSE ?
JUST YOUR PHONE NUMBER.
WE'LL TRADE.  YOU CAN HAVE
MY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER.
[ Laughing ]
DID YOU HEAR THAT ?
SHE PRACTICALLY THREW HERSELF
NAKED ACROSS THE TABLE.
NOT QUITE.
ANYWAY, YOU CAN
GET AWAY WITH THAT.
ME ?  I JUST SOUND LIKE
50 OTHER GUYS THAT DAY
WHO GAVE HER THE SAME LINES.
IT'S NOT THE LINES.
 IT'S THE DELIVERY.
MAYBE I SHOULD
GET MYSELF A CIGAR.
COULDN'T HURT.
WE SHOULD DO THIS
MORE OFTEN.
GRANDPA !
[ Monitor Beeping ]
[ Jack ]
I SHOULD HAVE LET THE KID DRIVE.
HE OPENED HIS EYES.
[ Jack ]
BRILLIANT.
YOU SHOULD BE A DOCTOR.
HMM, HE'S AWAKE.
[ Jack ]
SO SHOULD YOU.
OH, BROTHER.
MY BODY'S BROKEN,
AND THEY SEND AN OPTOMETRIST.
CAN YOU TALK ?
[ David ]
SURE.  WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO SAY ?
[ Jack ]
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED
TO MY VOICE ?
MUST HAVE STRADDLED
THE GEARSHIFT.
OH, GOD.  THANK GOD.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT ?
[ David ]
FINE, BUT MY VOICE
SOUNDS A LITTLE FUNNY.
BUT OTHERWISE I FEEL
LIKE I CAN GO TEN ROUNDS
WITH JACK DEMPSEY.
HOW'S DAVID ?
[ Jack ]
HOLY SHIT !
TAKE IT EASY, DAVID.
[ Jack ]
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ?
HERE, HONEY,
WHY DON'T YOU SIT DOWN ?
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
[ Jack ]
I'VE GOT TO TRY
TO FIGURE THIS OUT.
[ Jack ]
BOY, DAVID, DID YOU GET
THE SHORT END OF THE DEAL.
[ Betty ]  I REALLY WISH
YOU'D COME HOME AND SLEEP
IN YOUR OWN BED TONIGHT.
NO.  NO, THANKS.
[ Jack ]
THIS WILL BE BAD ENOUGH.
WELL, ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL LET YOU KNOW
HOW GRANDPA'S DOING.
[ Jack ]
NOT TOO WELL,
BELIEVE YOU ME.
ALL RIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT, DADDY.
TAKE IT EASY.
GOOD-BYE, HONEY.
"DADDY" ?
[ Jack ]
HOLD THAT SMILE, JACK.
YOU CAN DO IT.
[ Shouting ]
[ Laughing ]
YEE-HA !
[ Laughing, Shouts ]
NO, NO, NO !
[ Jack ]
THIS COULD BE INTERESTING.
[ Jack ]
YOU'LL GET USED TO THEM.
TRUST ME.
[ Groans ]
PAPERS.
[ Jack ]
"PAPERS" ?  WHAT AM I,
A COCKER SPANIEL ?
THEY'RE DUE, WATSON.
THEY ARE ?
CAN YOU RUN THAT
BY ME AGAIN ?
[ Laughing ]
WE DON'T MEAN
TO BOTHER YOU,
BUT WE'D LIKE TO--
OH,
THINK NOTHING OF IT.
I'M ALWAYS EAGER
TO HELP OUT A FELLOW
LAMBDA CHI DELTA BROTHER.
DON'T JERK AROUND, WATSON.
IF WE DON'T GET
THOSE PAPERS IN ON TIME,
WE GET SOME SERIOUS SHIT.
LET ME SEE IF
I UNDERSTAND THIS CORRECTLY.
YOU BOYS WANT ME
TO DO YOUR SCHOOLWORK ?
GIVE ME 20, WATSON.
WELL, I CAN
LEND YOU TEN FOR NOW.
[ Grunts ]
[ Jack ]
A SIMPLE NO WOULD BE ENOUGH.
TWENTY PUSH-UPS.
NOW.
BY THE WAY,
SMART-ASS,
NOBODY BETTER FIND OUT
YOU'RE DOING THIS WORK
FOR US.
UNDERSTOOD ?
[ Jack ]
WHO AM I GONNA TELL,
DAN RATHER ?
DON'T SLACK OFF,
WATSON.
[ Jack ]
SIX MORE PUSH-UPS,
AND I'LL BE ABLE
TO KILL THIS KID.
[ Jack ]
JESUS, DOES DAVID WAKE UP
TO THIS EVERY DAY ?
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT ?
TWENTY MORE ?
DON'T TAKE IT OUT ON ME.
THEY WERE KIND OF ROUGH
ON YOU, HUH ?
[ Jack ]
SO THIS IS THAT
WEIRDO FRIEND OF DAVID'S.
WHAT ?
IT'S MY EARRING.
[ Jack ]
WHAT NEXT ?
[ Jack ]
DOES THIS KID EVER
GIVE HIS MOUTH A BREAK ?
SOMEBODY WAKE ME
WHEN HE SHUTS UP.
WHY DO THEY FORCE
THESE HUMANITIES COURSES
DOWN KIDS' THROATS ?
IT'S GOT NO BEARING ON
THE REAL WORLD WHATSOEVER.
THAT'S WHY IT'S
YOUR FAVORITE CLASS.
IT IS ?
TODAY WE ARE GOING TO DO
SOME QUICK STUDIES.  RAYETTE.
YOU GOTTA STOP HITTING
THAT SNOOZE BUTTON.
OHH-HOO-HOO-HOO !
OH, YEAH !  HELLO !
DAVID...
DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM ?
DO YOU REALIZE THE LAST TIME
I SAW A NAKED LADY ?
[ Jack ]
IT WAS LAST THURSDAY,
BUT IT STILL GETS ME.
IF THERE IS ONE PERSON
I EXPECT TO TAKE THIS
CLASS SERIOUSLY,
IT'S YOU.
[ Jack ]  AFTER CLASS
I'LL BUY YOU A CUP OF COFFEE
AND A LARGE HOUSE WITH SERVANTS.
YOU'RE LOOSENING UP,
DAVID.
THAT'S GOOD.
I'M SHOCKED TO SEE A BIT
OF A PICASSO INFLUENCE.
THAT'S NOT LIKE YOU.
OH, SURE.
I THREW THAT IN.
NOT TOO MUCH.
JUST A LITTLE.
LIKE A SPRINKLING,
A SEASONING ON TOP.
[ Sighs ]
ARE WE IN EVERY CLASS
HERE TOGETHER ?
THIS IS BEGINNING
TO WORRY ME.
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN ?
AH, LOOK,
THERE SHE IS.
ROBIN.
SHE IS SOMETHING,
EVEN WITHOUT SPEAKING.
SO, IS EVERYONE
COMING ALONG
WITH THEIR PAPERS ?
OH.
YES, ROBIN ?
I CAN'T FIND HARRY TRUMAN'S
MIDDLE NAME.
[ Laughs ]
[ Jack ]
HANDS OFF MY GIRL,
YOU OLD LECH.
THAT'S BECAUSE HARRY TRUMAN
DIDN'T HAVE A MIDDLE NAME.
HIS PARENTS COULDN'T DECIDE
ON ONE, SO THEY GAVE HIM
AN INITIAL, "S,"
BUT THE "S" DOESN'T
STAND FOR ANYTHING.
[ Laughs,
  Blows Raspberry ]
[ Students Murmuring ]
YES ?
OH... I'M SORRY.
NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
PLEASE, GO ON.
YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST FISH
TO SWALLOW THAT LINE.
AND YOUR NAME IS ?
- HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW MY NAME,
  AND I'M IN HIS CLASS.
- [ Laughing ]
DAVID WATSON.
[ Swivet ]
OH, I SEE.
WHAT DOES THE "S" STAND FOR,
MR. WATSON ?
SERGEI,
FROM AN EAST EUROPEAN UNCLE.
BUT, FORESEEING THE RUSSIAN
TROUBLES THAT WOULD FOLLOW
AFTER WORLD WAR II,
HARRY MADE UP THAT HOGWASH
ABOUT THE "S."
[ Swivet ]
AND WHERE DID YOU COME BY
THIS INFORMATION ?
FROM THE MAN HIMSELF.
[ Girl ]
YEAH, UH-HUH.
[ Laughing ]
HARRY TOLD YOU ?
NO, HE DIDN'T TELL ME.
HE TOLD MY GRANDFATHER.
MY GRANDFATHER AND HARRY
WERE VERY CLOSE FRIENDS.
MY GRANDFATHER TOLD ME.
I SEE.
ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT
TO KNOW, PROFESSOR,
DON'T HESITATE TO ASK.
[ Students Laughing ]
[ Chattering ]
YOU GONNA
STAY OUT OF MY WAY
TODAY, WATSON ?
HEY, WAIT A SECOND.
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT ?
- RON DEACON.
- WHAT ?
YOU'RE RON DEACON'S
GRANDSON, AREN'T YOU ?
I THOUGHT
YOU LOOKED FAMILIAR.
YOU GOT THAT SAME
DULL LOOK IN THE EYES,
THE SAME JUNIOR JOCKSTRAP.
WHAT ?
I GOT SOME BAD NEWS
FOR YOU, RUSS.
YOUR GRANDFATHER WAS BALD
BY THE TIME HE GRADUATED,
WHICH MEANS YOU'LL PROBABLY
START LOSING YOUR HAIR IN--
HELL,
WHAT TIME IS IT ?
[ Whistle Blows ]
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE ?
NOTHING, COACH.
COME ON !
GET YOUR FANNIES IN ACTION !
GET YOUR BUTTS IN GEAR !
LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GO !
DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.
[ Man ]
RUNNERS SET.
[ Starter Gun
  Fires ]
GO, GO, GO !
[ Jack ]
WATCH THIS, HONEY.
YEAH !
[ Jack ]
I'M EXHAUSTED.
I GOTTA CUT DOWN
ON THOSE PUSH-UPS.
LOOK WHAT YOU GET
FOR FIRST PLACE.
SECOND PLACE, YOU GET A HUG
FROM A PUDGY COACH.
DAVID !
YOU QUALIFIED !
I'D HAVE BLOWN HIS DOORS OFF
IF I WASN'T WEARING
THESE WEDGIES.
YEAH, BUT YOU MADE IT !
YOU MADE IT !
HI.
HI.
YOU'RE MAKING QUITE A NAME
FOR YOURSELF TODAY.
YOU QUALIFIED, DIDN'T YOU ?
HEY, IS THAT TRUE
ABOUT TRUMAN'S MIDDLE NAME ?
THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD ME.
NO, HE TOLD
YOUR GRANDFATHER.
THAT'S RIGHT.
YEAH.
[ Laughs ]
WELL, DID HE TELL YOU
A LOT ABOUT HARRY TRUMAN ?
EVERYTHING HE KNOWS.
LISTEN, I'M DOING THIS PAPER
ON HIM IN OUR CLASS, AND, UH...
I'D MUCH RATHER TALK TO YOU
THAN PROFESSOR SWIVET.
THAT'S FLATTERING.
OH, NO,
I DIDN'T MEAN IT THAT WAY.
I-I JUST--
I'D BE GLAD TO.
NOW, THIS WEEKEND'S NO GOOD.
IT'LL HAVE TO BE
MONDAY NIGHT... OVER DINNER.
AROUND 8:00.
I'LL COME BY FOR YOU.
[ Sighs ]
OKAY.
OKAY, GREAT.
I'M TRI OMEGA.
[ Jack ]
OH, YES, "TRY TO MAKE YA."
I KNOW THEM WELL.
BYE-BYE.
BYE.
[ Gasps ]
[ Footsteps ]
HELLO, DAVID.
I'M GLAD YOU COULD COME OVER.
DAVID, I'D LIKE YOU
TO MEET MY PARENTS.
WHAT HAPPENED ?
WAS THERE AN ACCIDENT ?
NO, DAVID.
IT'S A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU.
HELLO.
DON'T WORRY.
IT WON'T COME OFF.
ROBIN TELL US YOU'RE
INVOLVED IN TRACK.
I GO A COUPLE TIMES A WEEK.
 I USUALLY BREAK EVEN.
# ROBIN'S GOT A BOYFRIEND
   ROBIN'S GOT A BOYFRIEND ##
WANT ME TO HIT HER ?
HAVE SOME MORE TO EAT, DAVID.
YOU'RE STILL SHRINKING--
UH, GROWING.
TELL ME, DAVID, HOW DO YOU PLAN
TO SUPPORT OUR DAUGHTER ?
SUPPORT HER ?
SHE WANTS SUPPORT,
SHE CAN BUY A CANE.
YOU KNOW, HE KNEW
HARRY TRUMAN PERSONALLY.
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
IF HE HUNG AROUND WITH
ULYSSES S. GRANT !
WE'RE THINKING OF TRAVELING
THROUGH EUROPE TOGETHER
THIS SUMMER.
THAT SHOULD BE FASCINATING
FOR YOU, DAVID.
IT'S CHANGED A LOT
SINCE THE RENAISSANCE.
I KNEW THIS WOULDN'T WORK OUT.
OUR AGES ARE TOO FAR APART.
THEY'D BE CLOSER IF YOU
DROP A ZERO FROM YOURS.
LOOK, MISTER, YOU BETTER
HOPE YOU NEVER GROW OLD.
I'M HOPING YOU WON'T.
[ Pounding, Door Opens ]
DON'T BE ALARMED, FOLKS.
WE'RE TAKING THIS MAN
BACK WHERE HE BELONGS.
HE'S NOT DAVID WATSON.
HE'S JACK WATSON, DAVID'S
81-YEAR-OLD GRANDFATHER.
- WHAT ?
- THEN WHERE'S DAVID ?
THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.
[ Knocking ]

[ Mumbling ]
[ Barrett ]
COME ON, WE'VE GOT TO FINISH
THE MURAL TONIGHT.
[ Jack ]
MURIEL ?  WHO'S MURIEL ?
I DID THIS ?
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
NOW THAT I'M IN MY
NEW PICASSO PHASE.
LET'S JUST WORRY ABOUT THAT
AFTER YOU FINISH THIS,
ALL RIGHT ?
DAVID, CAN YOU
HELP ME WITH THIS ?
COME ON !
OH, SORRY.
RIGHT THERE.
I CAN'T DO THIS.
WHY NOT ?
[ Jack ]
BECAUSE I CAN'T PAINT,
YOU LITTLE PEST.
MY HEAD IS
STILL A LITTLE FUZZY
AFTER THE ACCIDENT.
THAT NEVER STOPPED YOU BEFORE.
WHY DO YOU DO THIS ?
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?
HELPING,
SET UP, CLEAN UP.
THE SHIT WORK.
WHY ?
THAT'S NOT ALL I DO,
IS IT ?
I DON'T KNOW WHY
 I HELP YOU, DAVID.
THIS IS FUN FOR ME.
I LIKE YOUR WORK.
SOMEBODY'S GOT
TO SHINE THE LIGHT.
YOU'RE OKAY.
DAVID ?
DAVID, CAN YOU HEAR ME ?
COME ON, DAVID.
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
IT'S ME.  IT'S JACK.
DAVID ?
UH, IT'S HIM, ALL RIGHT.
IT'S JACK.
OH, CHARLIE--
IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU,
CHARLIE.
YEAH.  EASY, DAVID.
YOU'RE CUTTING OFF
MY CIRCULATION.
OH, SORRY.
I'M GLAD YOU'RE
ALL RIGHT.
HE'S NOT DOING TOO GOOD,
HUH ?
GODDAMN IT, JACK.
WE'VE GOT PLANS.
POKER TUESDAY,
THE TRACK--
NONE OF IT'S GONNA BE
ANY FUN WITHOUT YOU.
JACK... PLEASE--
AH, WHAT'S THE USE ?
[ Sniffs ]
NO, GO ON.
HE CAN'T HEAR ME.
SURE, HE CAN.
CHARLIE ?
YEAH ?
YOU REMEMBER MY WISH
AT THE PARTY ?
YOU MADE A WISH ?
NO, JACK DID.
OH, I SEE.
JACK DID, YOU DIDN'T.
NO.
DO YOU BELIEVE A PERSON
CAN GO FROM ONE BODY
TO ANOTHER ?
NOT IF THAT PERSON'S
GOT A WEAK BACK.
[ Chuckles ]
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.
I MEAN THEIR SOUL.
LOOK INTO MY EYES, CHARLIE.
WHAT DO YOU SEE ?
NOW, DON'T YOU SEE
EXPERIENCE, WISDOM ?
EH ?
I'LL TELL YOU THE TRUTH, KID.
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.
WHICH ONE IS THE WISDOM ?
FORGET "KID."
YOU'RE THE KID.
I'M 81 YEARS OLD.
YEAH, UH, LOOK, DAVID,
MAYBE WE OUGHT
TO GO BACK TO THE HOSPITAL
AND FIND YOU A NICE NURSE.
NO, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO GOES FOR NURSES.
AND THAT'S
NOT ALL I KNOW.
AQUEDUCT, 1942.
THE $1,200 PAYOFF
ON THE DAILY DOUBLE...
FROM THE TICKET
YOU FOUND ON THE FLOOR.
TO BE PRECISE,
ON A HORSE NAMED
PRUNE DANISH.
COME ON, COME ON.
YOUR GRANDPA COULD HAVE
TOLD YOU THAT.
RIGHT, SURE.  AND MAYBE
HE SAT HIS GRANDSON
DOWN UPON HIS KNEE...
AND TOLD HIM ABOUT THE TIME
HE AND HIS FRIEND CHARLIE...
GOT SNOWED IN
WITH THE ST. BARTHOLOMEW
ALL-GIRLS CHOIR...
AND DIDN'T GET DUG OUT
UNTIL EASTER.
OR HOW ONCE UPON A TIME
THEY GOT DRUNK WITH TWO
U.S.O. GIRLS AND--
# BY THE LIGHT #
# OF THE SILVERY MOON #
# YOUR SISTER JUNE #
# DROPPED HER PANTS
  IN MY ROOM #
# AND NEXT DOOR #
# WE WERE WITH ELEANOR #
# SHE WANTED MORE #
# BUT WE HAD SOME
  BEFORE ##
JACK !
CHARLIE, I GOT MY WISH.
I'M 18 AGAIN.
WHAT ?
[ Laughing ]
EASY, CHARLIE.
H-HOW DID YOU
PULL IT OFF ?
I DIDN'T.
I DON'T KNOW.
THE ACCIDENT--
SOMEHOW WE GOT SWITCHED.
YOU--
SO DAVID'S IN--
WHAT HAPPENS TO HIM ?
I WISH I KNEW.
OH, MY GOD.
JACK WATSON,
YOU HAD IT ALL.
AND NOW YOU REALLY
HAVE IT ALL.
GEE, I WISH I COULD
DO IT WITH YOU.
SO DO I, CHARLIE.
YOU WERE ALWAYS LIKE
A KID BROTHER TO ME.
THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO CHANGE
ANYTHING BETWEEN US.
OH, NO, NO, NO.
# BY THE LIGHT #
# OF THE SILVERY MOON ##
WHAT'S THE MATTER, HONEY ?
YOU'VE BARELY TOUCHED YOUR FOOD.
I'M NOT VERY HUNGRY.
I THOUGHT SOLE FLORENTINE
WAS YOUR FAVORITE.
LOOK WHAT I ALMOST FORGOT.
CAULIFLOWER AU GRATIN.
PLEASE, I CAN'T EAT
ANOTHER BITE.
OH.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WASTE
A TOTALLY GOOD MEAL.
NOW, EAT IT.
ARNOLD, HE DOESN'T
HAVE TO EAT IF HE
DOESN'T WANT TO.
HE'S BEEN THROUGH
QUITE A LOT.
WHAT ?  THE ACCIDENT
INJURED HIS TASTE BUDS ?
AND IS THAT HIS EXCUSE
FOR DRESSING LIKE THAT ?
OR DID YOU HAVE
ANOTHER ACCIDENT
ON THE WAY OVER HERE ?
IT WAS SERIOUS ENOUGH TO PUT
YOUR FATHER IN THE HOSPITAL.
I WASN'T TALKING
TO MY FATHER, WAS I ?
WATCH IT.
TRICK QUESTION.
AND SPEAKING OF DAD,
I THINK YOU OUGHT TO GO DOWN
AND VISIT HIM TOMORROW.
YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO YOUR WIFE
MORE OFTEN, ARNIE.
SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN
ONE STEP AHEAD OF YOU.
YOU GOT ANY DECENT COGNAC
IN THIS PLACE ?
[ Jack ]
HE'S RIGHT ABOUT ONE THING.
CLOTHES MAKE THE MAN,
RIGHT ?
[ Jack ]
MAYBE THEY CAN
MAKE ONE OUT OF THIS.
[ Chuckling Softly ]
[ Sighs ]
GOD, MADDY,
IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU.
WELL, IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU TOO, DAVID.
WE HAVE TO TALK.
SURE.
COME IN.
WHO'S THAT ?
JUST SOME FRIENDS, DAVID.
IT GETS SO LONESOME NOW.
COME, WE CAN TALK IN HERE.
UH, CAN I GET YOU A DRINK ?
SURE.  VODKA MARTINI
STRAIGHT UP WITH AN OLIVE.
JUST LIKE
YOUR GRANDFATHER.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[ Jack ]  CUTE KID.
HOW DO I TELL HER I'M SUBLETTING
MY GRANDSON'S BODY ?
NOW THAT'S A FACE.
[ Jack ]
I LOOK EXACTLY LIKE I DID
20 YEARS AGO-- OLD.
IT'S GOOD TO BE HOME.
[ Sighs ]
THANKS, HONEY.
SORRY.
[ Giggles ]
WHAT I'VE GOT TO SAY
IS DIFFICULT.
OH, DAVID,
YOU CAN TALK TO ME.
MADELYN, I'VE GONE THROUGH SOME
VERY STRANGE CHANGES RECENTLY.
THAT HAPPENS AT YOUR AGE.
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.
- I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
IT FEELS LIKE TO BE INSIDE
ANOTHER PERSON'S BODY ?
- DO YOU ?
- I'M JUST BEGINNING
  TO FIND OUT.
OH.
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GOING THROUGH.
I MEAN, ONE'S FIRST
SEXUAL EXPERIENCES...
CAN BE AWKWARD
AND DISAPPOINTING,
EVEN FRIGHTENING.
OH, DAVID, I'M SO GLAD
YOU CAME TO ME.
[ Jack ]
WAIT A MINUTE.  I HAVEN'T
EVEN TOLD HER IT'S ME YET.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?
[ Purring ]
NOW YOU JUST RELAX, DAVID.
NO, NO,
THIS IS WHAT I WANT TOO.
WHAT ABOUT GRANDPA ?
OH, DAVID, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S BEEN LIKE.
I MEAN, JACK'S FUN.
HE'S GOT STYLE AND CHARM
AND MONEY.
I WILL BE WELL PROVIDED FOR
THANKS TO JACK,
BUT HE'S AN OLD MAN.
[ Jack ]
I'LL KILL HER.
A WOMAN MY AGE NEEDS PASSION
AND EXCITEMENT.
[ David Gasps ]
[ Panting ]
AND PHYSICAL AFFECTION.
YOU'RE SAYING
YOU AND GRANDPA NEVER--
[ Laughing ]
THAT'S A RATHER
PERSONAL QUESTION, DAVID.
OF COURSE NOT.  BELIEVE ME,
IT WAS STRICTLY PLATONIC.
[ Jack ]
PLATONIC ?
DAVID, WHAT'S WRONG ?
I THINK I'M HAVING
AN ANGINA ATTACK.
WHAT ?
YOU'RE LEAVING ?
I DON'T WANT
TO HIT A LADY, HORTON,
BUT I WOULDN'T MIND
HITTING HER.
[ Jack ]
PLATONIC.  PLATONIC.
PLATONIC, MY ASS.
[ Giggling, Sighing ]
[ Sighs ]
OOH !
OH, THANK YOU.
HE'S ADORABLE.
THANK YOU, MADAM.
WHERE'S THE BAR ?
RIGHT THERE.
MAKE MINE
A VODKA MARTINI...
STRAIGHT UP
W-WITH AN OLIVE.
WE MET THIS MORNING
AT HOPPY HENDERSON'S FUNERAL.
HOW IS MR. HENDERSON ?
DEAD.
OH, YES, OF COURSE.
[ Horton ]
SHE DOES SEEM QUITE YOUNG.
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND
MY SAYING SO, SIR, BUT
COULDN'T THIS BE DANGEROUS ?
YOU'RE RIGHT.
HAVE SOME OXYGEN STANDING BY.
YES, SIR.
I'LL CALL YOU
IF SHE PASSES OUT.
JACK... PLEASE
COME BACK.
DO YOU MIND
IF I FINISH THIS CIGAR ?
YES.  COME BACK.
I CAN'T WAIT.
IT'S A DIRTY JOB,
BUT SOMEBODY'S GOTTA DO IT.
[ Jack ]
PLATONIC.
I TELL YOU,
THIS FEELS GOOD, CHARLIE.
A NICE LAZY DAY,
LETTING THE SUN
WARM YOUR FACE...
AND WATCHING
THE WORLD GO BY.
HEY, GUYS,
LET ME ROLL A FEW.
OKAY, GENTLEMEN, STEP ASIDE.
LET ME SHOW YOU
HOW THIS IS DONE.
MAYBE YOU'D RATHER BE
HANG GLIDING OR SOMETHING.
MAYBE I SHOULD
TELL THEM.
SURE.  WHY NOT ?
WHAT'S A FEW MORE PEOPLE
IN THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT ?
OKAY, OKAY,
IT'S MY TURN HERE.
HERE WE GO.
[ Chuckling ]
[ Screaming ]
[ Poker Chips Clinking ]
ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN.
DOWN AND DIRTY.
[ Laughing ]
POKER ?
DUH.
WHAT'S WITH THE CLOWN SUIT,
WATSON ?
[ Frat Brother ]
ISN'T HE NEGLECTING
HIS SCHOOLWORK ?
[ Laughing ]
[ Russ ]
THAT'S RIGHT, WATSON.
DON'T YOU THINK YOU SHOULD BE
AT THE TYPEWRITER ?
YOU BOYS DON'T REALLY
WANT TO TALK ABOUT
THAT SUBJECT, DO YOU ?
IF YOU DON'T WANT ME TO PLAY,
JUST SAY SO.
I GOT BETTER THINGS TO DO
THAN STAND HERE AND LISTEN
TO YOUR CHATTER.
YOU GOT THE CASH ?
YOU KNOW HOW
TO PLAY OKLAHOMA ?
FIVE CARD DRAW WITH A ROLL ?
[ Snickering ]
I COULD BLUFF YOU GUYS
INTO THINKING THAT
I WAS A REAL MARK,
BUT I KNOW HOW TO PLAY
OKLAHOMA...
AND ROOSTER BACK...
AND NICKEL HAYRIDE...
AND ALASKAN PULL...
AND QUITE A FEW OTHERS
THAT YOU BOYS HAVE PROBABLY
NEVER HEARD OF.
THE FACT IS, GENTLEMEN,
IF I SIT DOWN AT THAT TABLE
WITH ALL OF YOU NOW,
I'M GONNA CLEAN YOU ALL OUT.
[ Laughing ]
BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES
TO PLAYING CARDS,
YOU'RE JUST A BUNCH
OF KIDS TO ME.
YOU SEE, THAT'S THE CANDY,
AND YOU'RE THE BABIES,
 AND I--
I'M GONNA TAKE IT FROM YOU.
HAVE A SEAT.
GET AWAY FROM ME.
ALL RIGHT.
[ David ]
THAT'S A REAL POKER FACE, J.P.
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU GOT SOMETHING
CRAWLING UP YOUR LEG.
[ Sighs ]
[ Frat Brother ]
NO, THAT'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE.
I'M OUT.
I'M IN.
JUST YOU AND ME, DWEEB.
AND, UH,
[ Sighs ]
I THINK I'LL BE, UH,
BE RAISING.
I'M IN.
THAT'S ABOUT $500.
LET'S SEE IT.
I'M GOOD FOR IT.
THAT SHOULD BE
GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU.
UNLESS YOU'RE NOT TOO SURE
ABOUT YOUR HAND.
HOW ABOUT YOUR FEET ?
WHAT ?
FORGET ABOUT THESE CARDS.
WE NEVER
HAVE TO LOOK AT 'EM.
LET'S DOUBLE THE BET.
A THOUSAND DOLLARS
SAYS THAT I BEAT YOU
AT THE TRACK FINALS.
[ Onlookers Gasping,
  Murmuring ]
YOU'RE ON.
I WAS BLUFFING.
[ Laughing ]
YOU WERE BLUFFING.
[ Onlooker ]
OH !
[ Onlookers Laughing ]
[ Russ, David ]
THE TRACK.
SO WHEN THE BET
CAME AROUND TO HARRY,
HARRY HELD UP
HIS LAST DOLLAR AND HE SAYS,
"HEY, GUYS, NO MORE BUMPS.
THE BUCK STOPS HERE."
HE FIRST SAID THAT
AT A POKER GAME ?
THAT'S RIGHT.
I WAS REMINDED OF THAT STORY
AFTER PLAYING A FEW HANDS
OF POKER MYSELF RECENTLY.
BUT I THOUGHT THAT CAME OUT
OF HIS SENATORIAL CAMPAIGN
IN MISSOURI.
SEE, THAT COMES FROM GETTING
ALL YOUR INFORMATION
OUT OF BOOKS.
OKAY, WHAT ABOUT
DROPPING THE BOMB ON HIROSHIMA ?
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN--
THE MOST DIFFICULT DECISION
OF HIS CAREER.
HE AGONIZED OVER IT.
THEN NAGASAKI.
THAT WAS A LITTLE EASIER.
HE'D DONE IT ONCE ALREADY.
AFTER THAT
HE STARTED GETTING
A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY.
HE WANTED TO DROP IT
ON A FEW OTHER PLACES.
SWITZERLAND, ONCE,
WHEN HE WAS HAVING TROUBLE
WITH HIS WATCH.
I HAD TO TALK HIM
OUT OF IT.
[ Chuckles ]
UH, YOU'D BETTER NOT USE THAT.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO VERIFY,
AND, IF IT EVER GETS OUT, WHO
KNOWS HOW THE SWISS WILL REACT.
MORE COFFEE,
DAVID ?
OH, NO, THANK YOU, RITA.
I'M SORRY,
I FORGOT TO INTRODUCE YOU.
RITA, THIS IS ROBIN.
- ROBIN, RITA.
- HI.
YOU LOOK FAMILIAR.
HAVE YOU BEEN IN HERE BEFORE ?
[ Robin ]  I'VE BEEN IN HERE
WITH MY MOTHER A FEW TIMES.
I THOUGHT SO.
YOU LOOK JUST LIKE HER.
[ Jack ]  LOOK AT THIS.
THE CLAWS ARE OUT.
EASY, GIRLS.
THERE'S AT LEAST
TWO PORTIONS HERE.
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE PICK THIS UP AGAIN
FRIDAY NIGHT ?
UH, I'M SORRY.
YOU PROBABLY HAVE PLANS
TO GO OUT WITH YOUR FRIENDS
OR RUSS OR SOMETHING.
I WASN'T THINKING.
[ Jack ]
LISTEN TO ME.
I SOUND LIKE DAVID.
NO, I DON'T HAVE
ANY PLANS, BUT...
DAVID, NOBODY STUDIES
ON FRIDAYS.
MAYBE WE COULD, UM,
GO TO A CLUB OR SOMETHING,
HAVE SOME FUN.
"WE" ?
YOU AND ME.
[ Jack ]
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME ?
I CAN'T TALK.
COME ON, LIPS,
YOU CAN DO IT.
MOVE.
I'D LOVE TO.
GREAT.
IT'S A DATE.
GREAT.
[ Jack ]
YOWZA !
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN GRANDPA'S OFFICE ?
I'M RUNNING THE SHIP NOW.
[ Jack ]
IT'S A MUTINY.
HERE.
RUN THIS DOWN TO SHIPPING.
HOW CAN YOU DELIVER
THIS MANY UNITS
BY THE END OF THE MONTH ?
COME OVER HERE.
I'VE DESIGNED A SIMPLE WAY
TO RETOOL THE LINE...
THAT'LL INCREASE
OUR PRODUCTIVITY BY 28%...
WITHOUT A SIGNIFICANT
INCREASE IN COST.
YOU BYPASSED THE MOLDING
INJECTION FUNCTION.
I'M GLAD YOU'RE FINALLY
TAKING AN INTEREST IN WHAT
GOES ON AROUND HERE.
IT'S AMAZING.
DAVID,
PLEASE DON'T LIGHT THAT.
WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER
SHOW THIS TO GRANDPA ?
I TRIED, TIME AND AGAIN,
AND HE ALWAYS
IGNORED ME.
A LONG TIME AGO
HE STUCK ME IN SALES
AND FORGOT ABOUT ME.
I DON'T BELONG IN SALES.
I BELONG IN R AND D.
NOW I CAN FINALLY DO
WHAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING
ALL ALONG.
I WISH THIS COULD'VE
HAPPENED DIFFERENTLY.
I'D LIKE HIM TO SEE ME...
LIKE THIS.
I WISH HE'D JUST
GIVEN ME THE CHANCE.
GET THIS TO SHIPPING,
AND THEN GO STRAIGHT
TO THE ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT.
THEY GOT A MOUNTAIN
OF FILING THAT'S PILED UP
SINCE YOU WERE HERE LAST.
HEY, UH, SWEETHEART,
CALL AN OFFICE BOY.
[ Shouting, Laughing ]
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS,
SETTLE DOWN, LISTEN UP.
NOW, WE'RE HERE
TO DISCUSS THE ANNUAL
CELEBRATION AND RALLY...
THAT'LL TAKE PLACE ON THE EVE
OF THE INTERCOLLEGIATE MEET.

SO MUCH WORK FOR YOU.
UM, WELL...
WHEN SOMEONE BUILDS
SOMETHING LIKE THIS,
THEY DON'T CARE
HOW IT LOOKS TO THE PEOPLE
WHO LIVE AROUND HERE...
OR THE KIDS
WHO PLAY IN THIS LOT.
THOSE PEOPLE HAVE TO LIVE
WITH THIS BIG, UGLY WALL...
IN THEIR FACES...
EVERY DAY.
I SAW THIS WALL,
AND I THOUGHT IT COULD
USE A COAT OF PAINT.

A GOOD REASON TO ME, DAVID.

OH, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT

THEY'RE KILLING
THEIR OWN SON.
AND THAT'S NOT
THE ONLY SURPRISE THEY'VE
GOT WAITING FOR THEM.
I REWROTE MY WILL.
I GAVE MADELYN
HALF OF WATSON DIALS.
IF I GO, THAT BITCH
WILL RUN THE PLACE.
"THAT BITCH" ?
SINCE WHEN ?
SINCE SHE TRIED TO SEDUCE
MY GRANDSON, A.K.A. ME.
CHRIST, CHARLIE,
IF THIS HAPPENS,
I'VE SCREWED ARNOLD,
I'VE SCREWED DAVID,
I'VE SCREWED MYSELF.
THAT'S A LOT OF SCREWING
FOR A GUY YOUR AGE.
THAT WASN'T DAD.
IT WAS JUST HIS BODY.
I KNOW.
IT WAS
THE ONLY DECISION.
OH, OF COURSE IT WAS.
HE'D SUFFERED ENOUGH.

GOOD NEWS FOR YOU.
MY GOD.
DAD.
WE'VE GOT SOME TALKING
TO DO, ARNIE.
WE CAN COMMUNICATE
THROUGH THIS ?
- THEY PULLED THE PLUG !
- I'VE GOT GOOD BATTERIES.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN MY OFFICE ?
BUT THEN AGAIN,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN SALES ?
YOU DON'T BELONG THERE.
LOOK, ARNIE, I KNOW
I'VE BEEN TOUGH ON YOU.
I HAVEN'T LISTENED

I'M SORRY.
LET'S WORK TOGETHER
FROM NOW ON.  OKAY ?
DO ME A FAVOR, ARNIE.
DON'T DO
THE SAME THING TO DAVID
THAT I DID TO YOU.
I'M NOT.
DID YOU EVER ASK YOURSELF
WHETHER DAVID WANTS
TO BE AN ACCOUNTANT ?
DID YOU EVER ASK DAVID ?
FOR ALL WE KNOW,
HE MIGHT WANT TO BE--
OH, HELL, I DON'T KNOW.

YOU CAN PLAY

WELL !
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS.
YOU'VE BEEN
A LOVELY COMPANION,

IS A CONFUSING AGE.
I DIDN'T QUALIFY
FOR THIS MEET.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
DID YOU DO IT ?
WHAT ?
PULL SOME STRINGS ?
NO, I WOULDN'T DO THAT.
I KNOW TRACK DOESN'T
MEAN THAT MUCH TO YOU,
BUT THIS RACE MEANS A LOT,
IF ONLY TO PROVE TO YOURSELF
THAT YOU CAN BEAT RUSS DEACON.
YOU'RE STRONGER
THAN YOU THINK, DAVID.
DON'T ASK ME HOW I KNOW.
I JUST DO.
I'M TELLING YOU,
YOU CAN DO IT...
IF YOU BELIEVE IN YOURSELF HALF
AS MUCH AS I BELIEVE IN YOU.
I COULDN'T HOLD A CANDLE

WHEN YOU'RE OUT THERE,
LISTEN TO THE CROWD.
THEY BELIEVE IN YOU TOO.
THEY'LL BE CHEERING

Hey, Chip, honey, thank God you're home.
I think these guys are stealing my stuff.
Chip, isn't that my television?
Chip?
- Let's move!
- Chip?
Alright, Chip,
I think you'd better face it.
I don't think we should see each other anymore.
And this relationship isn't working--Ow!
Chip! Do you hear me Chip?
I'm not gonna take this shit anymore!
And my G.E. clock radio.
All my Buffy St. Marie albums.
My Boston fern.
And all the fancy h'orderves stuff that I bought for tonight.
He took it all...except this.
Oh, he left you something?
Hm-hm, oh the guy is all heart.
Yeah, well, he took the can opener.
Where's the phone?
I'm calling the cops.
No. Sonia, Chip and I have been seeing each other almost two months.
It's practically a relationship.
You can't have him arrested.
It'll ruin everything.
'I don't believe this.'
He's just a little miffed, that's all.
It's my fault, he kept saying "No party."
"It's just a stupid birthday.
It's not important."
- 'But, I wouldn't listen.'
- Jesus.
He trashes your apartment.
He steals your underwear.
Just because you want to throw a party on his birthday?
No...it's my birthday

- Alright.
How are you, Denny?
- Fine.
- You look really nice tonight.
How's your boyfriend, Chip?
Fine.
That's nice.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
'Hey baby...lighten up.'
'Well, rid of that jerk.'
I could've made it work.
I can make anything work.
Aye, Denny.
Oh, no...no.
No, not tonight, oh, no.
'Denny, can you tell him that I am busy' or that I'm dead or something,
I don't care.
- Who?
- Phil.
[phone ringing]
Hello, Gre Gre.
'Denny, it's Phil.'
'Hi, Phil'
- 'Is Sonia there?'
- 'No I'm sorry, she's out.'
- 'Can you give her a message?'
- Okay.
'Tell her I want my umbrella back at the station, will ya?'
- Okay.
- 'You have a nice evening.'
- You too.
- 'Thanks, so long, kid.'
Bye.
-'He says that he--'
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll give it to him tomorrow.
How do you do that?
Every now and then, it just happens.
Let's just drop it, okay?
I wish I could see into a guys head.
I'd know from the start he's gonna hurt me.
Baby I worry about you.
You either got to get tough or you gotta get a gun.
And what am I going to do with a gun?
It's New York.
Use your imagination.
Wo-o-o Angie! Babe, it's me!
What, don't you remember me?
The Veterans Hospital..
You taught me how to walk again.
- What do you want?
- Ahem. To change your life.
How about a cup of coffee?
Oh, sure.
Hey! No, this isn't what I meant!
What's wrong with you?
Woah. Gah.
Oh, they're everywhere!
Woo. Ah!
Okay, let's face facts.
You are attracted to scum.
The strays, they see you coming miles away.
Dogs, alley cats, actors.
Now, I don't know what's worse.
The guys, or the animals.
Rocco was nice.
Who?
Followed me home a couple of weeks ago.
And let me tell you something, when you make a dog dinner he jumps up, he licks your face.
He does not load your stuff into the back of a van and nearly run you over.
I miss him.
Chip stole him too?
He left me last Saturday.
Denny, you gotta make some changes.
You lie on the floor, people are gonna wipe their feet on you.
- I'm affectionate.
- You're a carpet!
- I like men!
- Ha-ha. Why?
It's not like you can be friends with one.
You ever try to have a conversation with a guy?
Especially when the Flintstones is on?
Now, I'm not saying that they don't have their uses.
Boy, I wish I could handle men like you.
I wish I was gorgeous.
I wish I was smart.
I wish I was sexy.
I wish I was dead.
Oh my God, it's the dork.
Don't look.
For God's sake don't make eye contact!
'I think he saw me.'
'Look at him. What a putz.'
'Here he comes.'
'Don't look up.'
Maybe he'll keep walking.
He's not that bad.
Bon soir and good evening, ladies. Denny.
- Hello, Charles.
- Ah, Chucky, please.
- Or, Chuck.
- Check, yo, check.
You-you know what I was feeling?
Can you guess?
I-I felt a kind of a chemical rea..
A kind of like a magnet pulling me to this end of the table.
Oh, God.
I hope I'm not being too forward.
I felt your Ying reaching for my Yang.
Oh.
And I think that we're dest..
I think you-like, you.. you-me-you-you know what I mean?
That-like-you, ah..
I'm all clogged up here. Do you have a tissue or something?
Uh, I don't-I don't think so.
Awh, this is wonderful, here can
I just get the-get this..
Look..Oh!
Look, look, Chucky, if you wanna score why don't you go score your term papers okay?
Denny, you're talking to a guy with a little paper parasol in his drinks.
So, Charles, I didn't know you were in education.
- What grade do you teach?
- 'No, I don't teach.'
I'm on the board of Ed.
In charge of student discipline.
- Oh!
- Aah!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Okay, that's the last straw.
Get out of here.
That is the last straw.
Now, stop talk..
I said now!
If you'd like to get together, or like have dinner or just talk,
I'd like to do that.
Cause I think you're a very nice person.
Um, bye.
Goodbye, Charles.
- Oh!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
Can't you be a little more selective, he's such a geek.
He's just a little lonely.
Oh, and just how lonely are you?
Bye.
Not that lonely.
'Come on, change you luck.'
'Change your luck. Come on, good luck for Sam.'
'Good luck for Sam.'
Ah!
'Come on, come on, get you good luck here.'
'They call me the fixer.
Cause I got the elixir.'
You got a problem?
Shi-i-it, so what?
[laughs]
'You give me the description and I got the prescription.'
You wanna hand Ol' Fixer the cash?
And he'll fix you up in a flash!
Come on, come on, get your good luck here.
See your fixer and get your good luck.
Hey, look out, boy!
You're bruising the merchandise.
Can't change your luck, boy.
You ain't got none.
Unless...there is one thing might work.
You got 20 bucks?
Then you're a hopeless case, boy.
Worst case I ever seen.
Have a nice day, boy.
They're everywhere.
Woah! I've got to have a woman!
Hey, you!
- Hold it!
- Woah!
[car honking]
Can you believe that?
[dog barking]
[intense music]
- Grr!
- A-a-ah!
- Captain Janus.
- Captain Janus, please.
This girls story was like the last ones.
It was a costume.
Where were the cops?
How could they miss him?
- It wasn't Halloween.
- It was the Village.
The way he burned and mangled those girls.
He must be some kind of Coke weirdo.
Captain Janus, will the Mangler strike again?
Oh, jeez, don't give him a name.
I'm gonna have a dozen copy-cat Manglers by tonight.
[chattering]
Let's go and write up a story.
Hm.
Here.
Hey, don't go.
Ah...don't you have any work to do?
You even trying to catch this guy?
Oh, don't you start on me too.
I'm doing the best I can.
'It's not eas..'
Can we go to dinner, tonight?
No, we have been through this before.
I am not going out with you.
But, if I take you to bed, why can't I take you to dinner?
Don't try to get close to me,
Phil, I never asked for that.
[sputter]
'Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh'
Oh, ha-ha, uh-uh. Go.
'Because I don't wanna see you anymore, that's why.'
'Besides, I'm doing something tonight that's a lot more fun.'
- Setting fire to my hair.
- Excuse me?
- Yeah.
- Miss?
- Yeah.
- 'Miss?'
- What?
- 'I ordered a No. 3'
Yeah. One beef, lecithin, albumen and gorse berry burger.
Hold the mug.
'I'm sick, you listen to me for a living.'
[burps]
- No.
- Sir?
No.
Sir?
Excuse me--
I am on a personal call.
Do you mind?
[beep]
[dramatic music]
Girl.
Food.
Ah, girl and food.
Are you gonna finish that?
Yes.
Awh. Hmm.
Oh.
You sure you're not finishing this?
I'm positive.
Oh-h-h my God!
Oh-h God!
Look what you've done to my dress!
What the hell kind of meat is this?
It isn't.
What exactly did I just eat?
Why don't you take a look?
Poached beets. That's this red splotch right here.
And the yellow.. The yellow stain is stone wrapped mullet.
With natural albumen and lecithin granules.
And here, here we have the sun-dried gorse berries.
Ugh, gorse berries?
I'm sorry you didn't like it.
I ate a fruit burger!
You gave me a fruit burger!
You gave me a fruit burger?
And there were beets in it, too.
I ate a gorse berry beet burger with lecithin. Ugh.
Where are we going, fruit-burger?
Oh, will you please stop following me?
- Fruit-burger..
- It's Denny. Oh God.
Kaz.
Wait. I'm getting a really strong impression here.
Don't laugh, but sometimes I can..
Wait, wait, it's coming, yes, yes...you don't like me.
Oh, will you leave me alone?
Shame on you.
Maybe I'm an incredibly warm, sensitive and giving person.
Maybe I'm appalled at what I did to your dress.
- Maybe I wanna pay for it.
- Fine. It costs $35.99.
You take a check? Here-here I'll write you one.
I got plenty of 'em.
Don't bother, I wouldn't take one of your checks.
Oh, don't worry, they're not mine.
- Who's Dr. Harold Frawley?
- What do you care for?
He's a doctor.
What are you doing with his check book?
Denny what?
I need your last name.
- You're not gonna get it.
- Alright, forget the check.
You, uh, you take
American Express?
'Jeez, you're a touchy broad.'
[jazz music]
So-o-o. This is where you live, huh?
Nope...I'm visiting a boyfriend.
A very big boyfriend.
Oh, well, goodbye then.
Denny? I know I'm obnoxious, but you're a very attractive woman.
And I just wanted to be close to you for a few minutes.
I'm sorry.
Well...that's okay.
That's sweet of you.
Goodbye.
A-a-ah!
Oh-h, a-ah.
What's wrong?
Nothing, uh-h.
Are you sick?
I think maybe you should see a doctor. Can you stand up?
If you help me. Maybe you should put your arms around me.
- Okay.
- Lower...tighter.
I can't budge you.
Maybe you should get your big boyfriend.
Who? Oh, I'm sorry.
I made that up,
I don't have a big boyfriend.
Oh, good, let's get married.
Oh, God.
Oh..
I hate this guy.
You can't run away from it, fruit-burger.
A successful relationship takes work.
What do you know about a successful relationship?
Did you ever have one?
Sure, hundreds of 'em.
I'm not perfect.
I've got problems, but I've learned to live with 'em.
- So will you.
- Oh! Will you get away from me?
Sexual attraction is a powerful thing isn't it?
- Well you're crazy!
- Ha-ha-ha!
- You're crazy!
- I told you I got problems.
Later, lamb chop.
[intense music]
[music continues]
Oh.
A-a-h!
You little bitch.
Oh, Chip, honey, is something wrong?
O-o-h!
- You called the cops on me!
- No, I didn't
What's the matter?
The TV. break down?
I got busted for passing a hot blender. Yours.
Now my girl don't rat to the cops and get away with it.
I'm not your girl anymore.
You left me, remember?
You don't want me.
Stop and think about this!
This is a terrible relationship.
Help!
Firstly, I never got my time.
And you're mean, you're insensitive.
You robbed my apartment. You don't call me, you don't write.
Help! Help me!
[intense music]
God damn city's full of animals.
It's okay, kid,
I got you.
Ugh.
I got you, broad.
Stay away. Stay back.
Don't you come near me.
You come-you come one step closer and I'm gonna..
Coffee?
Kaz?
Hey...you say that nice.
Come on, take it.
I'm not gonna bite ya.
Oh God, I'm sorry, out there I thought that I saw a..
Yeah?
Nah...I got conked on the head one too many times this week.
But it was you, wasn't it?
- 'You chased Chip away.'
- Drink your coffee.
Okay.
What? Would you rather have decaf?
No.
Don't do that.
Why are you crying?
- Because I'm a shlub!
- You're not a shlub.
I am.
I am a shlub.
Look at me.
I'm a woman of the 80's.
I can do anything I want to do.
I can risk my life in armed combat.
I can have empty sex with strangers.
'The world is mine.'
But all I want, is someone to take care of.
Somebody to take care of me, too.
I am pathetic.
No-o-o.
I should be in a museum.
Stuffed.
Look, at least you know what you are.
You're gonna be okay, kid.
I fall in love with bozos.
- That's okay?
- No, that sucks.
[chuckles]
But the rest of it, it's very sweet.
Denny...do I scare you?
Maybe I should be afraid of you.
But I'm not.
I don't think you want to hurt me.
I wouldn't want to.
Denny...I'm so tired.
Would, uh...you mind if I slept on your couch tonight?
[thunder rumbling]
I don't know.
[instrumental music]
Well, goodnight, Kaz.
Goodnight.
[thunder rumbling]
[intense music]
[groaning]
[music continues]
'Panic in the city'
'as the "Mangler" continued to elude the police.'
'A fourth victim was viciously mauled last night.'
'The unknown assailant attacked
31 year-old Miguela Valdez.'
'Outside Gre Gre, her Greenwich Village shop.'
Kaz?
Kaz?
- Ah!
- Ah!
Hi.
Hi.
I made you breakfast.
I've got this funny taste in my mouth.
Look, I wanted to say I was sorry about last night.
Dumping all my problems on you and everything.
Oh, no, that-that's okay, you don't have to.
Did I...did we do anything last night?
Thank God.
What's wrong?
You don't wanna know about it.
Uh, look, I'm outta here.
Why?
Look, Denny, it's sex.
I can't do it, think about it or even look at it.
Kaz, don't tell me you can't make love.
Okay, I won't tell you.
But what about your hundreds of successful relationships?
That was a lie.
Why'd you lie to me?
Because I'm a liar.
Look, don't get pissed at me.
Compared to the rest of it that happens to be one of my better qualities.
Why did you have to go and be so nice to me?
Thanks for the couch.
Look.
A lot of guys have trouble making love.
Look, I got a good idea.
Why don't you stay a little longer and you can sleep on the couch.
Uh-h-h.
Well, why not? You got no place else to go, do you?
Besides, I like the company.
I know this sounds crazy but you remind me of Rocco.
- Who's he?
- Doesn't matter.
- You wanna stay?
- On the couch?
- M-hm.
- Really?
- Hm.
- We'd just be friends?
No kissing, no holding, no touching?
No kidding?
- Hey..
- Hm?
Is this a re-relationship?
I-I never had one,
I don't know how.
I'm perfect for you then.
'Cause I can have a relationship with anybody.

How is she, doctor?
She's had a great traumatic shock.
If you wanna go home and get some rest
I'll see to it you're called, when there's a change.
She's my sister.
She ought to know somebody cares what happened.
The cops sure don't.
Has she said anything, remembered anything?
Not yet.
Hey.
Yeah.
Miguela. Come on.
Try to remember.
'Get a look at his clothes or his hands?'
He didn't have any hands.
Like an animal.
Like a wild animal.
No!
Ah!
Let me go! Get away!
Oh, my God!
Oh!
Help me!
You okay?
I saw it.
What?
God, Phil.
I don't know.
You want a ride home?
No.
You'll be alright?
'Hi, it's Denny.
It's Tuesday, don't hang up.'
[beeps]
Yeah. Hello, Denny's machine.
This is Chuck Sawyer.
I'm sorry, I dumped the nuts on you, the other night.
I'd liked to make amends, take you out to dinner tonight.
Your choice. Okay?
Give a call 961-5000 Station 54.
I'll wait till until five o'clock...or six.
I'll be there till six o'clock.
Gimme a call, Denny.
I'd like to take you out tonight. See you soon. Bye-bye.
[people chattering]
Oh, look. Look. I've been looking all over for these.
'You'll die in the next century.'
- Hey, um..
- I love these.
I'll be right back, okay?
That's it?
What do you want for five dollars?
You're a phony!
Pull out another ten and maybe
I'd see you win the lottery.
Next case!
Next case!
Hey, Fixer. Do you remember me?
What's the matter?
You got the curse all over you, boy.
Why don't you get a hold of it? Tuck it in.
Any half-ass psychic can smell you coming, a mile off.
Listen, please...don't run away.
You said there's something you might be able to do.
Maybe, but you said you didn't have no bread.
- You got some, now?
- No.
'Then what do you got?'
You didn't go and do something stupid, I hope.
You didn't go and fall in love?
Oh!
That's why you want to give up the power of curse.
For a woman?
Boy, you like to break my heart.
Uh, hey, hey, come back.
Come, come, come on.
Well, let's first see, how you got this curse.
Come on, get it.
Turn it around here.
Turn it around, that's it.
Like that, come on.
That's it.
Hold it right there.
Hold it right there, now.
Come on here.
'What're you doing?'
Been crystal ball shopping, lately? Expensive.
Now, where's a horizontal control on this thing?
Got you.
'Hey, that's me.'
Hi, Bibi.
Bibi?
Bibi Chaskaluska!
Hi, Kaz.
Kaz, you are such a cute guy.
Ever kiss a girl before?
Not exactly.
Well, have you or haven't you?
I said, not exactly.
Kaz!
[Bibi moaning]
This is great!
Show me how to do this.
Shut up and watch.
[speaking foreign language]
'What's she saying?'
- 'She's talking Romanian.'
- 'Romanian?'
Get off!
[speaking foreign language]
Grandma!
'Run, you stupid kid. Run!'
[speaking foreign language]
Pazatski!
'Whoa-a!'
Well, what?
Tell me what's a Pazatski?
You! She stick the devil in you, boy.
You mean I'm possessed?
Worse. You are Pazatsked.
- Open your pants.
- What?
Come on! Come on! I ain't gonna kiss it. Drop them.
- Come on! Come on!
- I'm coming.
- Come on!
- Wait.
Right there.
That's where the devil went in.
Can't you see I'm busy?
You can't take it, go back to Jersey!
Now, this is important. Don't let nobody stick you, there.
Especially with something made out of flint.
That'll kill you and the devil, both.
Wait, wait.
- If I'm possessed--
- Pazatsked.
Whatever! How come this only shows up only when I get horny?
What's so funny?
Ever so you feel, you get horny for real..
...you can't get down with no female when you got a mouth full of razors and a burning tail.
She's down laid a case of
Romanian blue balls on you, boy.
Ha ha ha.
Look. How do I get rid of this curse?
You gotta do something noble.
Then you scare the devil right out of you.
Eh, sounds like a third rate fairy tale.
You're mighty picky for somebody living in a twilight zone.
- And--
- Oh, there is a catch, right.
Ain't there always?
When the devil leaves out of you, it grabs a hold of the person in your life, closest to you.
You get the cure.
They get the curse.
What's up?
I never felt so close to anybody before.
Close?
'You feel the same way, don't you?'
Don't you?
Yeah.
[beeps]
Hi, Denny's machine. Listen,
I've got great tickets tonight for the command performance for Lady Dia and Prince Charles.
Corniche Hall. Stars, Sylvester
Stallone doing Dickens.
Korishnakoff dancing, twin piano magic, of Forenti and Tischer.
[laughs]
Hey, lady! You remind me of my wife.
That bitch!
Kaz.
I'm home early.
They closed the pet shop.
I thought maybe we'd pack a luncheon.
Happy Birthday.
'Surprise.'
Oh, Kaz.
[saxophone music]
- You know what?
- Mmm?
This is the best birthday
I've ever had.
It's not even my birthday.
- Kaz.
- Mmm?
[music continues]
I want you to stay all night, this time.
And, uh..
...you don't have to sleep on the couch.
Eh..
Denny, I...have to..
Oh! Wanna open you present?
Okay.
* Ta Ta Ta Ta
Tadah!
Kaz!
- It's a television.
- Mm-hm.
It's my television.
Where did you get it?
Eh, I got a couple of friends on the street.
They showed me where to find good ol' Chip.
- You stole back from 'em?
- Get out of here. I bought it.
On Visa, um, I forget who's card, Dr. Sydney somebody.
- You didn't like it?
- I always did.
Oh! Mm-hm.
- Denny, stop.
- You don't want me to stop.
- This isn't fair.
- Right.
Uh-huh.
These feelings. You're feeling them for the wrong person.
It's never been my strong point.
Denny..
No!
Denny...no!
Aahh! No!
What's the matter?
Kaz, what are you doing?
- Are you taking a shower?
- 'What's it look like?'
Come out of there!
God damn New York city plumbing!
You call this cold water?
I think it's time you talk about our relationship.
- Do you love me or not?
- Of course, I love you.
What do you think
I'm doing in the shower?
- Oh, I'd like to know.
- I can't live here anymore.
Why? Why? When everything's going do well.
Kaz, please tell me what's wrong?
It won't change the way I feel about you.
- You wanna bet?
- Try me, please.
You're not gonna like it.
You're really not gonna like it.
Alright. Just promise me that you won't faint or scream.
- Or lose your Pizza.
- I promise.
I'm pazz..
What?
Jesus, woman! You can't expect me to say it twice.
- Well, you were mumbling.
- I don't mumble.
Well, you just mumbled.
You just said, "I'm a..
"...I'm possom."
What's possom?
No, Pazatsked!
I can't understand you, if don't speak clearly.
It's like being possessed by the devil, only worse.
Oh!
I..
...am a Pazatski.
[sighs]
Oh, say something.
I sit here..
...scared to death of what you're going to say to me.
And you...turn it into some dumb..
...adolescent joke.
Hey, you don't have to get mad at me.
I'm telling you the truth.
I'm sick.
Some people get fever blisters when they are sick.
I get was long tail and lizard skin.
Just stop it!
Why do you find it so hard to believe?
If this was the middle ages you'd just say "Oh".
- Your sick.
- That's what I'm saying.
I need to get out of here.
I'm talking a walk.
- I'm coming with you.
- Oh, yeah. Where's your leash?
You see, you said it wouldn't affect how you feel about me.
I touch you right now,
I'll get a freezer burn.
You were going to tell the truth.
Why would I lie about a thing like this?
- Because you're a liar.
- I am not lying now.
Is that a lie, too? If you liar you lie about not lying.
- How do I know the difference?
- Okay, you want proof?
You wanna see me change in front of you? Kiss me. Come on.
Come here!
[clucking]
What's the matter, huh?
- Stop playing you stupid game--
- Who's playing?
Put your mouth, where your mouth is.
Kiss me. Stir me up.
Prove to me that I'm wrong.
- Okay.
- Come on.
Huh? Huh?
- Here I come.
- Come on.
[violin music]
- Well?
- Getting there.
- Have I changed?
- Boy, I'll say.
[instrumental music continues]
[Kaz groaning]
- Kaz.
- I've gotta stop!
Relax and go with it.
[screaming]
Stop it!
Ow! No!
[screaming]
Bingo!
Heh heh heh.
Hey, wait!
Don't try and leave.
What do you think I'm doing this to impress Steven Spielberg?
[Kaz laughs]
[laughing continues]
You don't need water.
You need a drink.
- 'Change back!'
- I can't.
But it worked last time.
Come in here, come on.
[whistling]
- Come on. Into the shower.
- It's late for a cold shower.
It has to go away by itself, like a heat rash.
I can't take much more of this.
[telephone rings]
Oh-h-h!
Oh!
[grunting]
Because I'm hysterical!
Don't you think you're just overreacting a little bit?
Who's this?
Not now!
[laughing sarcastically]
Oh, my God!
[snarling]
[sniffing]
Oh, God!
[telephone rings]
What?!
Hey, I finally got you!
Now, how's about that dinner, huh?
[growling]
Rrr! Rrr, yourself, you little devil.
- Not tonight, Charles.
- 'Why not?'
Because...I am having a heart attack!
He-hello.
Oh, Denny!
Ouch!
Kaz!
[laughing]
Come on, come on.
Follow me here.
When I have something to say, I'll say it.
No comment.
I've got to talk to you. Now!
I think I know who the mangler is.
Or what he is.
Go on.
Hey, Valdez. You're not gonna faint on me, are you?
Phil..
...that day in the hospital,
I saw who Miguela saw.
The mangler. In my own head, I saw him.
He's the devil, Phil.
You see, when he's not out hunting..
...he looks just like anybody else.
He's safe that way.
But if I can get close, tune in, you know
I can help you find him.
Baby, I know that what happened to your sister..
...it's a big shock for you.
'But you gotta quit pushing yourself so hard.'
I'm not crazy!
You come in here and you say..
[clears throat]
...you've seen the devil.
What am I supposed to think?
[laughing]
Forget it.
I'll find it myself with or without your help.
[Intimate Stranger singing
"What Are You Waiting For"]
* Intimate stranger
* Caught by surprise
* Their perfect faces
* Tell no lies
* We have no time to spare to be cruel or unkind *
* We have to make the best of what we find *
* No crosses to bare
No secrets to share *
* So what are you waiting for?
* Oh what are you waiting for?
'Kaz.'
Kaz.
[sighs]
I've been looking all over for you.
[rock music]
I wish you would trust me.
I feel real positive about this.
We can work it out.
I know we can.
- I'm a Pazatski.
- Big deal.
I turn into a monster.
Piece of cake.
Listen, don't try to talk me out of this.
I've given it a lot of thought.
I miss you so much, Kaz.
I want you to come home.
I'm turning myself in.
To what?
No! To the cops.
I think I'm the mangler.
Ha ha ha.
- You? Get outta town!
- Shh.
I'm serious. Every night
I left your apartment
I never remembered where I went.
The way these girls are getting sliced up, what if it's me?
- What if I go after you?
- You are not the mangler.
Kaz, I've been wrong about men my whole life..
...but not this time.
Not about you.
Can I buy you a drink?
[giggling]
Can I buy you..
I'm sorry, I'm on my way to the men's room.
Yo, Jackie! Come on, come on, come on. Sit down.
It's alright.
- I didn't think you like me.
- No, I don't.
- I'm not a bad guy, you know?
- I'm sorry.
I've been listening to your conversations over here and, um..
...it's no use, Jackie.
You're never going to find anybody here you could trust.
Secrets...they all got 'em.
Deep dark secrets.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Okay, I'll prove it to you.
You come home with me tonight you change, and you don't run away this time.
Let me finish.
If you start to look at me like I'm a light snack
I'm out the door and into therapy before you know it.
I was born in Philadelphia,
I mean, in the city proper.
Lot of people who say they were born in Philly really mean the suburbs like Valley Kenwood but I was actually in the city.
We didn't like our teachers, but we didn't shoot them.
- You'd be careful.
- Mm-hmm.
- You promise?
- I cross my heart.
And hope for the best for both of us.
- Denny.
- Sonia! Hi!
- I missed you.
- Oh, I missed you, too.
- Hi! Welcome to the city.
- This who I think it is?
- Hi, Charles.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi!
I thought she was never gonna let me meet you.
- Hi, Chuck Sawyer.
- Hi.
You must be Denny's boyfriend, right?
- Right.
- Denny.. and you look wonderful.
'Thank you.'
Li-Like I said, I've been trying to reach you.
- There's been a problem--
- Uh, excuse me, Sonia.
Could I buy you a drink?
It's my pleasure.
We were just leaving, weren't we..
- Ow!
- ...honey?
Don't you want to go home and change, hmm?
Come on.
- 'Bye.'
- 'Goodbye, Charles.'
'Bye.'
[bongo music]
'Uh, this is fun place.
What are we doing here?'
'What's that?'
'Sonia, what are you doing with that?'
Huh?
Hey! Are we going back to your place?
Well...come on.
[sighs]
Hey.
- Denny.
- Hmm.
I can't.
You don't really wanna do this, do you?
Yes, I do.
[Denny moaning]
[intense music]
Oh, no!
You look really, really awful.
Okay, we're gonna go for it now.
[furniture rattling]
Do you have to do that?
Do what?
[screams]
Oh!
- Oh-h-h!
- A-a-ah!
Help me.
[evil laughter]
[screaming]
Speak not that name..
What?
Denny!
He's taking over!
'Denny!'
'Shut up in there! What, you've got no consideration?'
I'm sorry, my boyfriend's possessed.
No!
No! No!
No-o-o!
[screaming]
No!
[screaming]
You got any more Fritos?
Hey! What's on the tube?
[cracking]
Come on, it's early.
You got any beer left?
[laughing]
Oh, my God!
[thud]
It's the date that wouldn't leave.
Where'd you put the cheese balls?
Come on.
Come on!
So what's the matter?
No man is good enough for you?
What are you, Miss Perfect?
You're never gonna get married?
- You're too good. Is that it?
- Yeah, look, no. I'm goin--
- Miss Too-good-for-anyone--
- Oh, Kaz! Make this stop!
Oh-h-h! This isn't happening to me.
I promise I won't go out on any more dates.
Cousin Bernice got married.
Just make this not be happening, lady.
'Lady, are you in there?'
Hello.
Hello.
'This isn't happening to me.
I'm a nice girl.'
[whispering]
Lady, are you in there?
[Denny screams]
[trumpeting]
'Denny. Denny,
I'm in here.'
Kaz.
'Kaz, is that you?'
[hissing]
Kaz, is that you?
A-a-ah!
[rock music]
[tires squealing]
[coughing]
What happened?
[clears throat]
- Did I do something?
- You have to get out for this.
Why is it when a woman gets involved with a man she starts hawkin' him to change?
Are you telling me you don't want to?
I can't. Not without hurting you. You're too close to me.
Fixer said that according to the legend--
Wait a minute!
Kaz...the demon took over, and you blacked out..
...and you didn't hurt me.
You see I told you wouldn't.
Hah!
[rock music]
[telephone ringing]
Hello.
- Now?
- 'Yes.'
Oh, God!
'You've got to help me.
I'm in trouble.'
- Okay.
- Hurry.
'S-s-sonia?'
[dialtone]
- I have to go now.
- Hey, hey, hey. Wait!
Thought we were having a pretty important conversation here.
I know, but it was
Sonia, and it's..
- Something's ha--
- Oh!
I don't know. She sounded frantic. I have to go.
Yo, Chuckie. Go straight to the 6th Precinct.
Ask for Capitan Phil. Tell him
I found what I was looking for.
- Where are you going?
- Hunting.
I gotta go.
Meanwhile...you remember..
...you look ugly..
'...you talk ugly, but you are not the mangler.'
We've got other problems.
[door closes]
[Sonia grunts]
Ugly? What, is she crazy?
I don't look that bad.
- Hello, Denny!
- Oh.
You shouldn't be out late at night.
The boogeyman will get ya.
[squeaking]
- Charles, I had dinner..
- No. This isn't about dinner.
Sonia was worried about you and asked me to pick you up.
See, her car's right over there.
Thanks, Charles,
I'm gonna take a taxi.
I don't think so.
Hey.
Ah!
- What do you want?
- You.
So...that's why you got
Denny to leave.
Well, look.
I'm very touched, but didn't she tell you?
You see, Denny and I are very much..
Sword.
What are you doing with a sword?
To kill you. You vicious, psychotic bastard!
[Denny groaning]
Oh!
Your head would look good in my shop. Ha ha ha!
Denny!
A-a-ah!
Hey!
Son of a bitch!
What the..
A-ah!
Get outta here!
[engine revving]
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
[tires screeching]
I just remembered. I have a very important appointment.
Oh, shit!
Hey, what did I ever do to you?
Oh, you devil!
I saw you change!
Oh, that.
I was just kidding.
This is highly illegal!
Ah, ah!
Whoa-a!
Whoa-a!
[horns blaring]
Great, Charles, you bummers head!
Get off my car!
Peddling without a license, drunk and disorderly resisting arrest, and vagrancy.
I'm no vagrant.
I'm a squatter.
[screaming]
[tires screeching]
[siren wailing]
[screaming continues]
- Charles! To your left!
- Crazy..
[screaming]
Pull over!
- It's just the mangler here.
- Where?
They trying to kidnap me, boy!
Got me change a woman.
I'm half-woman, anyways.
Ha ha ha.
Hey!
Oh!
58 requesting backup.
Central Park. Damn it!
[Sonia screaming]
We'll be home in just a little...while-e-e!
[all screaming]
[Denny groans]
Oh-h-h!
[Sonia gasping]
[grunting]
[grunting]
* ...that old time religion
[grunting]
[grunting]
[Charles singing in distance]
[grunts]
Ah!
[gasping]
A-ah! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
I cut you with this..
You're not a demon.
I cut you with this, and you're still alive.
Look, Sonia, you saw me change, but I'm not the mangler.
But if you're not the mangler...then who is?
[dramatic music]
[sirens wailing]
Sonia!
What the hell is this?
Where is the mangler?
- He's up at the castle.
- And he's got my woman!
* Gimme that old time religion
* Gimme that old time religion
Alright.
Get in!
I will not. Just who do you think you are?
I'm the mangler.
Right.
Right.
Ah!
Hey, kid. Come on.
Good heavens.
[snaps fingers]
So.
- You want cookies?
- No, thank you.
Come on, you're my guest.
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go.
I'm so glad you're here.
Yeah.
Here's my friend,
William. Kiss.
This is the Bible.
It-It's a little old.
It needs rebinding and stuff.
Oh, here, you know, I can teach you how to make that glove like the one that I made to chloroform you.
It's real simple. It's real easy. Come over here.
I'm proud. You're really gonna love this. It's okay.
This is my, this is my laboratory.
I've got all my chemicals.
Do you know what this is...boom!
And do you know what trinitrotoluene is?
- Mm-hmm.
- What is it?
- TNT?
- You get a cookie!
Ha ha ha!
'Denny!'
Help me, please!
Help, I'm up here!
Stay back, or I'll slash her throat wide open.
What are you waiting for?
Come on, let's get up.
[thud]
It's locked.
- Get the battering ram!
- Phil.
I know somebody who could climb up on here from behind.
- Who?
- Him.
- Me?
- Yes.
Whatever I saw you turn into, it had wings. Change. Go on.
What, just like that?
What you think I am, a machine?
I can't turn on and off like a faucet. I need the mood.
I gotta have a paper lantern over a lightbulb, a couple--
- Denny's life is at stake.
- Don't pressure me.
I'll never get a devil on.
I need...her eyes, warm skin, and the curves..
You're talking about sex?
Why didn't you say so? You just hit the mother lode, baby.
Don't fight it, boy. Let it take you all the way for once.
[Sonia laughing]
[Sonia moaning]
Look out! He's got a bomb!
What?
- Run! Run!
- Move it, move it!
- 'Get outta here.'
- 'Take cover.'
[both moaning]
And she's supposed to be my best friend.
Hey, are you upset about something?
[moaning continues]
Relax, I want you to enjoy this.
Oh, no!
'Ah! A-ah!'
[both laughing]
[moaning]
'Oh, my God.'
Let me see your hands.
[Ken laughing]
'More. More!
Ha ha ha.'
[Denny blowing]
[Denny continues blowing]
Stop that!
Please, Charles, listen to me. You need..
...psychiatric help.
You're mentally ill.
Oh, I like that in a man.
Ah, no way!
Now what has he got?
Woman!
- And what do you want?
- Blood!
- And how do you feel?
- Fantastic!
Alright!
[grunting]
[continues grunting]
Go get him.
Officer, I'm Phil.
Glad to see you.
Sharpshooter's here, sir.
Can you, uh, pick this guy off without hurting the girl?
No guarantees.
I'm sorry, Denny. I didn't want to kill you this way.
Oh, good, you really had me going there for a minute.
[growling]
A-ah!
[growling]
Denny, get outta here!
- Uh, is he a friend of yours?
- Who? I don't see anyone.
Go downstairs!
- Are you talking to me?
- What's the matter with you?
What's the matter with me?
What's the matter with you? Huh?
'You've got some nerve..'
Shit.
I saw you and Sonia.
- I was doing it for you.
- You were enjoying it!
'You know everything, don't you,
Ms. Better-than-everybody-else.'
'Don't you talk to me in that tone of voice.'
It's showtime.
Get the band!
There's gonna be fireworks.
- I'm doing this for your good.
- I'm sure you a..
Do you think we could discuss this later?
Kaz!
Oh, my God! There's a Pazatski up there.
Look!
Oh-h!
The water, Kaz!
Throw it in the water!
Oh!
Oh, no!
* ...an old time
[whistling]
Way to go, bro.
Ha ha!
[explosion]
'One, two, three.'
- A-a-ah!
- Battering ram is here, sir.
[explosions continue]
One, two, three.
A-a-ah!
- Let's go get him.
- Follow me.
Come on, this way!
This way, right here!
You know, I'd like to meet your parents.
That way!
Kaz!
Kaz!
[growling]
Ha ha ha.
Go away!
[growling]
Come on!
Over there!
[groaning]
[screams]
O-o-ooh.
[gasping]
Ha ha ha.
Young man..
...you're disobeying me.
I thought I was ugly.
[electricity sizzling]
Kaz, what's happening?
[groaning]
Ugh!
Ouch!
Change back, you can't fight him like that!
[screams]
- Leather G-strings.
- Wet French kissing.
[screams]
Hey, I don't have any underwear on.
[screams]
Oh, Bibi Chaskaluska, where are you when I need you?
Hey! You know Bibi, huh?
Hell of a girl but her grandmother was kind of a drag.
[groaning]
Oh, Kaz!
Help me!
[Denny screams]
It was meant to be.
[screams]
Oh, Denny!
[crack]
Ah!
Denny! Run!
'Oh, Denny! Run!'
Let's talk.
- Oh, no!
- Get away from him, Kaz!
Here you go, Pazatski!
Find the scar!
Kaz!
- Ah! Aah!
- 'Ha ha ha.'
Great shoes, those Italian..
Aah!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Need a hand?
Sex doesn't pay.
It's bad for your complexion.
Stick him, Pazatski!
Stick him?
You say stick him?
You see how big that son of a bitch is?
Ha ha ha!
Kaz! Somebody do something!
Kill that guy!
Come on!
Kaz!
I can't believe it.
You stabbed me!
I got him!
'Somebody help..'
[screaming]
[indistinct chatter]
A-a-a-ah!
You did a good thing.
A real good thing.
A-ah!
[squeaking]
[roaring]
Oh..
Just another day in the big city.
Let's go home, boys in blue.
Terrific, kid!
[hissing]
[exhales forcefully]
- Are you alright?
- You know what?
I think maybe I am.
[both giggling]
[popping]
[cameras clicking]
Hey, how 'bout some..
See you later, pal.
Could you, uh, take the battering ram back to the department?
See if that was standard.
I was real proud of you back there.
I think you're pretty great.
- Oh, Denny!
- What?
- Do you know what this means?
- What?
Look.
- Yeah?
- Look! The scar is gone.
Fixer was right.
He said if I did something really noble the curse would jump right out of me and into..
- Oh, no.
- What?
I forgot about that part.
Denny, would you do something for me?
Sure, I--
Mmm! Ha ha ha.
What are you doing?
- You're okay!
- What's the idea?
Fixer said whoever was closest to me would get the curse.
But I was nowhere near you.
- No, no, no, he meant--
- Hold it.
- Are you telling me...that we--
- Ah!
Wanna take a shower, fruitburger?
Yeah.
Right, sarge.
Yeah.
Hey, baby!
Let's howl!
A-a-ah!

I'M SO HAPPY
TO SEE YOU, CHARLIE!
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH I MISSED YOU!
SHUT UP!
YOU WANT THE WHOLE WORLD
TO KNOW I'M BACK?
YOU THOUGHT I WAS DEAD.

HE TRIED TO KILL ME.
I'LL MAKE HIM PAY!
WE DON'T WANT TO
DO THAT.

HE SHOULD HAVE GONE UNDER.
THAT'S IT, BOSS.
WE'LL GO UNDER.
DEEP, DEEP UNDER.
I DON'T WANT TO GO UNDER.
THE OPERATION GREW.
IT GOT BIGGER.
NOW HE WON'T SHARE.
WE COULD SHARE
A NICE LITTLE PLACE
IN THE HIMALAYAS.
I HATE THE HIMALAYAS.
WAIT. THEY GOT
GAMBLING, RACES.
WELL, THEY EVEN GOT
A TOWN CALLED TIBET.
YOU KNOW, TO-BET.
WE COULD NAB LLAMAS,
MOUNTAIN GOATS,
OPEN OUR OWN TRACK, BOSS.
HE'S GOT SOMETHING
UP HIS SLEEVE.
YEAH, A GUN.
WHEN I FIND OUT
WHAT IT IS,
I'M GONNA RUIN HIM.
I'M GONNA MAKE HIM
SUFFER...SLOW.
HE'LL BE BEGGING
FOR MERCY.
I'M BEGGING THAT
WE GET OUT OF HERE.
BOSS,
CARFACE HAS GOT THUGS,

Don't push me.
Stick with him.
Don't let him get too far ahead.
- Daddy, I'm tired. Can't we stop?
- Yeah, honey.
There isn't any people on the side streets.
And they're darker.
- That's just what they'd want, honey.
- Daddy, I'm scared.
So am I, honey. Hang on.
Be light. Be a feather.
- What's going on?
- Excuse me!
"(man #1 )" He's seen us.
Whatever you do, no eye contact.
- He can make you do what he wants.
- "(man #2)" Got it.
"(man #1 )" See him?
He just got lost in that crowd there.
"(man #2)" That's him, over on the right.
Right there on the right.
(man #3)
Maybe I can cut him off at the corner.
Let's get him.
Daddy, they're coming.
Taxi. Taxi.
Drive.
- Stop!
- Stop the car. Hey, cabbie.
Don't pay any attention to them.
Just drive.
Come on, let's get back to the car.
We can chase them down. Let's move it.
- Hey, mister, where are we going?
- The airport.
Wait, wait, I can't go to the airport.
It's too far.
Look...
I'm gonna give you a $500 bill. I want you to take my daughter and I to the airport.
Sure. OK, mister.
(distorted voices)
- "(Dad)" Drive.
- I ain't turning down no $500.
We are going to give each one of you ten young ladies and gentlemen an injection.
Five of these injections will be water.
Five of them will be water mixed with a tiny amount of a chemical compound which we call... "lot six".
The exact nature of this compound is classified but it is essentially a hypnotic mild hallucinogenic.
We employ the double-blind method of administering the compound, which is to say that neither you nor we know who has received the clear dose and who has not.
Until later, that is.
You will be under close supervision for 48 hours after the experiment.
Are there any questions?
Dr Wanless, is this experiment being done by The Shop?
No.
Absolutely not.
- Yes?
- When do I get my money?
- "(all)" Right on, man.
- That is important.
Well, immediately after the experiment, along with all the other students.
I'm broke too.
So, if we may begin the injections now, please.
Andy McGee.
I'm Vicky Tomlinson. I'm a little nervous about this, Andy McGee.
- What if I go on a bad trip?
- We'll probably just get distilled water.
"(Wanless)" Feel any pain?
(woman)
I feel a pressure. It's a bad pressure.
"(Wanless)" It will pass.
- How are you feeling?
- When do we start to shrink?
You believe you're going to shrink?
Sh-ri-nk...
You'll be fine.
We'll be fine.
(disturbed voices)
"(woman)" I can't feel my hands.
- Thank you. What a nice compliment.
- I didn't say anything.
You did.
- What'd I say?
- You said my hair is beautiful.
Like copper set on fire.
Yeah.
But I didn't say that. I just thought it.
(Andy thinks) I love you.
I've always loved you.
- I've known you for a thousand years.
- (Vicky thinks) That long?
Yes, I've loved you too.
(commotion)
(screaming)
Hey, buddy, airport.
- You OK?
- "(groans)"
I got a headache. Wake up, babydoll.
We're here. Come on.
Where are we?
Hanover, sweetheart. Airport.
- Try the airport.
- Roger.
Suppose we catch up with him.
Do you wanna face him down?
What do you call this thing he's got?
How he pushes people.
The Shop figures he may be running down by now.
He's overdone it before and wound up in bed.
It's doing something to his brain.
Like what?
Giving himself pinprick haemorrhages, maybe?
- It could kill him.
- Good, let's hope.
We don't have any more money and we don't have anything left to sell.
I can't stay here.
It's not right. It's not right to steal.
Honey, I know, but it's not right for them to keep coming after us, either.
Now, I explained that to you, Charlie, at least I tried.
- About the big bad and the little bad?
- That's right. Lesser and greater evil.
- Big bad is what I did to Mommy?
- Oh, darling, please.
Don't. Don't, baby.
I made Mommy scream.
Shh...
Does your head still hurt?
Poor Daddy.
Gotta keep a lookout.
OK.
"(man)" I don't know what you're doing here.
I don't want to have anything to do with you. I told you not to follow me here.
Besides, it's not my fault.
I'm not responsible.
This ain't got nothing to do with me.
I'm not the only guy you've been seeing.
I'm not ready to get married, so why don't you just get outta here?
- Why don't you just stop bugging me?
- "(Andy)" Come on, Charlie.
"(woman)" You told me you loved me.
You told me if anything happened you'd take care of me.
This ain't got nothing to do with me.
We've been through this 100 times.
I'm not responsible.
Look, I told you not to follow me here.
"(woman)" But I can't do it on my own.
I don't know where to go.
- I don't have any money.
- I'm not the only guy you've been with.
"(woman)" That's not true.
I swear to God you're the only one.
I've never slept with anyone else.
"(man)" That's not what my buddy Al told me...
I didn't mean it, Daddy.
- Ow!
- Hey, hey!
- All right, buddy, come outta there.
- Mind waiting till I put my feet out?
I was coming with you and I saw him and before I could stop it, it just happened.
- I didn't like him and it just got away.
- It's OK, honey.
- But I set him on fire.
- Charlie.
- I didn't mean it, Daddy.
- Charlie, stop it.
I want you to listen to me.
You said it got away from you and it did.
But not like before.
It just got away a little bit.
Charlie, you might've set that man's face on fire or his hair.
Now, it always goes out at somebody you don't like.
- But you didn't really hurt that guy.
- Not like I hurt Mommy in the kitchen.
Baby. Baby, you've got to stop thinking about that.
It wasn't you that really hurt Mommy.
They killed her.
That's right. That's right.
Now...
We've got to go on.
Single file. Just like the Indians.
And keep as far over to the side of the road as you can, OK?
"(man)" I seen them both.
This guy looked kinda sick, or something.
- Are you OK?
- "(Andy sighs)"
- So far, so good, baby. You getting tired?
- Nope.
Daddy, I feel those bad men from The Shop around again.
OK. Come on.
OK, sweetheart, come on.
Head up Route 70.
Oh, Daddy.
"- (screams)" Daddy, get up.
- (truck horn)
Daddy, wake up.
(she screams)
Daddy? Daddy?
Are you all right?
- I thought you were dead.
- Are you kidding?
Think I'd do that to you?
You're all I've got in this world.
But I'm happy about that cos I'm crazy about you.
I'm crazy about you too, Daddy.
Come on. We gotta find a place to sleep.
We can afford it now.
- I burned him.
- Rest, sweetheart.
You didn't hurt him. You controlled it.
- "(groans)"
- Shh...
(Andy) OK, Charlie.
Now, let it out. Easy does it.
Let it go.
Attagirl.
Attagirl. OK.
Now pull it back.
Pull it back, Charlie.
Pull it back, Charlie.
Good Lord.
Now, you've got to learn to control that.
You gotta try real hard. OK?
- I couldn't help it.
- Tomorrow. She's tired.
Time for bed.
You can try again at breakfast.
- I wanna do that again.
- No, tomorrow.
I'm not tired. I wanna do it again.
- I said no.
- Again. Now!
(screaming)
I'm sorry, Mommy. I didn't mean it.
Well, you did it. You hurt your mother.
- I'm sorry, Mommy.
- It's all right. Mommy's all right.
Charlie, you have got to control this thing because it's a bad thing, you understand me? A bad thing.
- Leave her alone. It's not her fault.
- "(phone rings)"
- Hello?
- Sorry.
(he sighs)
- Hung up again?
- Whoever it is.
We know who they are and they wanna make sure we're staying right here.
(Andy) Vicky? Charlie?
I'm home.
Sweetheart?
Vicky!
Oh...
Oh, no.
Oh, no. Please, please, God.
Please don't be here.
Please don't...
Oh, no! Please, no, no!
Oh, no! Babe! Oh, what did they do?
What did they do?
They put this in your mouth.
(weeps)
Where's Charlie? Charlie!
Charlie!
Charlie!
Charlie!
Charlie!
Charlie!
Joan, by any chance is my daughter with you?
- (Charlie screams)
- (man) Hold her!
OK, that's far enough.
Drop the gun.
Drop it.
Bring her to me.
You're blind.
"(yelling)" My eyes!
You too, you son of a bitch.
You killed my wife. You're blind.
"(screaming)" My eyes!
Oh, my God! Leon!
- Andy!
- "(man)" My eyes!
Joan.
Go back inside the house.
You won't remember any of this.
- Leon!
- Oh, God!
My eyes! Son of a bitch!
Can't see!
- Wake up, baby. It's time to move on.
- Morning.
- Elaine. Morning, Josie.
- Good morning.
Jamieson called in. No word yet on the McGees. He'll ring later.
Put him right through when he does.
And Rainbird is in your office.
- When did he get back?
- This morning.
- Morning, Kenny.
- Morning, sir.
Welcome back, Rainbird.
- How was Venice?
- "(he chuckles)"
Sinking.
- Is our problem there solved?
- Our problem there is solved.
- Dr Wanless is here.
- Christ, there goes a beautiful day.
Ah, the good doctor.
What do you want, Joe?
- Have you caught them yet?
- We'll catch them. What do you want?
What do I always want?
Why do I stay alive?
To try to persuade you to sanction them both, expunge them, wipe them from the face of the earth.
Andrew McGee and his daughter constitute the greatest threat that's confronted this nation.
- That's a lot of crap.
- You feel guilt!
Eight out of ten of our young volunteers have died, committed suicide.
You want to justify your participation.
You were all in favour of it at the time.
I know.
I didn't realise.
None of us did.
Lot Six was nothing more than a synthetic copy of pituitary extract.
- A powerful painkiller hallucinogen.
- For God's sake, Joe, don't start again.
You see...
You see...
This pituitary extract is responsible for the occasional flashes of psi ability which most human beings demonstrate from time to time.
Precognition, telekinesis, mental domination, the kind of domination that this experiment brought out in Andrew McGee.
What is the point, Doctor?
Since this child was born, her father has tried to inhibit her use of those powers.
But what if his control had weakened now?
Why would he lose control now after all these years?
Ask yourself this question.
How exhausting must it have been for Victoria and Andrew McGee when this child was an infant?
The bottle is late. The baby cries.
And at that moment, one of her stuffed toys right there in the crib beside her bursts into smoky flame.
Joe, she's just a little girl.
She can light fires, yes, but you're making her sound like Armageddon.
That's what it might well be.
Suppose lighting fires is merely the tip of the iceberg.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I am talking about a talent that is directly linked to this child's pituitary gland, undeveloped pituitary gland.
What happens when she becomes adolescent and that sleeping gland wakes and becomes, for 20 months, the most powerful force in the human body?
Suppose we have a child here who some day is capable of creating a nuclear explosion simply by the power of her will.
- That's insane.
- Is it? Is it?
Then allow me to progress from insanity to utter lunacy.
Suppose there is a little girl out there somewhere today, this morning, who has within her, lying dormant at present, the power some day to crack the very planet in two, like a china plate in a shooting gallery.
What if we could train this little girl?
And others as well.
Could we have more powerful weapons?
No! No more experiments.
Don't force me to go above your head because I will if I have to.
I'll have you and this entire establishment eliminated.
An excitable man.
Where are we gonna go now?
We have to find some place to stay for a while.
I don't think anybody'll believe us but if we send letters to the newspapers maybe The Shop will have to lay off.
We could go to Granther's.
- What made you think of that?
- I don't know.
Cos I was thinking about your grandfather not five minutes ago.
We'll check the motel.
I want you to work the road further down.
Well... That's a pretty little miss.
- What's your name, missy?
- Roberta.
Well, Bobby, where are you headed for?
We're headed for Tennessee. Knoxville.
My wife's there visiting her sister.
- Ran into a little problem.
- Did she?
Yeah, labour. This one's got a new baby brother. 1 .40 this morning.
- His name's Andy. Isn't that a nice name?
- I think it's a corker.
Mine's Irv Manders. Hop in.
I'll get you ten miles closer to Knoxville.
(car horn)
- Hey, Al, it's them.
- You're joking?
- No, damn it, it's them.
- Did you get the number?
- Did you see which way they went?
- I didn't even see them check out.
Hey, we got them.
Why don't you two come home, take lunch with me and the wife?
- We couldn't...
- Daddy, I'm starving.
- Are you sure you got enough?
- Always, and I'm glad to have you.
- Thank you very much.
- My pleasure, Bobby.
It'll be my wife's too when she gets a look at you.
Always wanted a little girl herself.
But I guess that wasn't to be.
"(lrv)" Got a song for you.
Oh, there was an old hen
She had a wooden leg
Finest old hen that ever laid an egg
She laid her eggs all over the farm
Another little drink won't do us any harm
(laughter)
- Who'd you bring home, Irv?
- This little girl is Roberta.
This young fella here's her daddy.
I didn't catch his name yet so I don't know if we're related.
- Frank Burton, ma'am.
- Hello, I'm Norma Manders.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Your husband invited us back for lunch.
Hope you don't mind.
Why, sure. Come on in.
Come on, Bobby. Feedbag.
(belches)
More room out than there is in, button.
If I eat any more, I think I'll split.
That's what my mom used to...
I mean that's what she always says.
Norma, why don't you and Bobby go out and feed those chickens?
I wanna have a little talk with Frank here.
- Would you like that?
- Do they peck?
Only what they eat, honey.
- Come on.
- OK. Goody.
Want a beer, Frank?
- It isn't Frank, but I guess you know that.
- I guess I did.
- What is your name?
- Andy.
- Well, Andy, what about that beer?
- I guess I could use it.
You got it.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
- Here, let me help.
- No, that's all right. I know this routine.
- Cops after you, Andy?
- Sort of cops, yeah.
You snatch that little girl from her mother?
No, she's my daughter, but her mother didn't set the cops on us.
Her mother's been dead for a year.
Don't appear like you got her against her will.
What do they want you for, anyway, Andy?
- Who are they?
- Government agents.
- FBI?
- No, The Shop.
The Shop?
Yeah, it's really the Department of Scientific Intelligence. DSI.
My daughter, Charlene and I, Charlie, we were part of an experiment that happened a long time ago.
Tell me about it.
OK, now go ahead.
Thank you. Do you eat these chickens?
If I can catch one, I might eat one.
We eat the eggs.
They want to examine her and study her.
So they can figure out just what makes her able to do what she can do.
I think they want to use her to reactivate the Lot Six programme.
Andy, I think you ought to call the police.
Turn yourself in.
- Yeah, I know it sounds crazy.
- As crazy as anything I've ever heard.
Daddy, I fed the chic...
You told.
Daddy, why'd you tell?
(gasps)
They're coming. They're coming for us.
They're gonna kill you, Daddy. We have to run, we have to hide, we have to...
Yes, yes, that's what they wanna do.
They wanna kill you.
Kill you like they did Mommy and take me away. I won't let it happen.
Holy Jesus Christ. Did she do that?
Charlie, now, watch what you're doing.
Is it too late?
Yes, they're coming up the dirt road now.
Daddy, I'm scared.
Charlie, you can stop them.
If I do something bad, will you still love me?
Oh, Charlie...
Of course I'll still love you.
I love you more than anything in the world, no matter what happens.
I got some tall apologising to do.
There's a line of cars coming up the road.
I'll stand with you if you want.
I'll get my deer gun.
You don't need your gun.
Hi, Andy. Hi, Charlie.
- Honey, you don't have to run any more.
- Go away.
Afraid I can't do that, honey.
I have my orders.
No one wants to hurt you or your daddy.
You liar, you're supposed to kill him and I know it.
I'd advise you do what my daughter says.
You know why she's wanted.
Remember the soldier at the airport?
You men are trespassing.
I want you to get off my property.
We're government agents, sir.
These two folks are wanted for questioning. Nothing more.
I don't care if they're wanted for assassination.
- Show me a warrant or get off my land.
- We don't need a warrant.
You do unless I woke up in Russia this morning.
If you'll just get in the car, we can discuss all this.
Honest to gosh, there's nothing going on here.
- We know what's going on.
- Please, don't make me do anything.
"(Andy)" Get out! Don't you understand what she's doing? Can't you feel it?
Don't be stupid.
If we can only discuss this, please.
- Get him!
- Watch it, Andy. Watch it.
Not the girl. Not the girl.
(screaming)
Help! Help!
Help me!
No, don't.
No, don't.
No! Don't!
(screaming)
Now, get out of here.
She's never done anything like this before. I don't know if she can stop.
Get out. Get out.
Go! Go!
Help me!
- Let's go!
- Don't leave me!
- Charlie.
- "(screaming)"
Stop it. That's enough.
Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!
Sorry, Daddy.
(screaming)
Let's get outta here, back to The Shop.
Go, go, go!
Oh, my God.
Andy. There's an old Willy's Jeep out behind the barn.
No, Irv, don't get involved any deeper.
Those men came here without any warrants, tried to take them off our land, one of them shot me.
What do you want me to do?
Turn them over to the secret police?
They'll be getting their peckers up enough to come back. Be a good Nazi?
- I guess not.
- You don't have to do anything else.
No, please, take the Jeep and get away.
Just get away.
Charlie.
There's the lake. We're here.
(she giggles)
Come on, Charlie.
We got a lot of cleaning up to do.
Nobody's lived here since your grandfather died.
I hope that key's still here.
Do you think they'll find us here?
After what you did at the farm,
I think they're gonna stay pretty far away.
If they still wanna capture us, they're gonna have to figure out a different way to do it.
Well, anyways, we've got us a new home.
Let's go. Let's go.
Don't it look good?
Daddy, will things ever be the same for us again?
Will I be able to go to school, and things, again?
Sure you can.
- After you write the letters, right?
- That's right.
Tell the newspapers all about it.
Then the running'll be over.
We'll live normal lives, like everybody else.
- Can I be...?
- What?
- Like everybody else?
- Darn tootin' you can.
I wanna be.
Look who's here.
- How'd you feel?
- Safe.
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, Daddy.
(mutters)
(clears throat)
Do you have a phone here?
Right over here.
- They're here. They mailed some letters.
- All right, good deal.
Get a hold of Bates. He can be there in an hour and keep me informed.
- Mr McGee?
- And Miss McGee.
- Where are they?
- The summer cottage near Bradford.
- I'll bring them here.
- Oh, just like that?
- You know what that little girl can do.
- I know.
That's why I'll bring her here.
So you can do all your tests.
On the condition that you give her to me for disposal when you're finished with her.
What?
- I want her when you've finished with her.
- You are mad.
How right you are.
So are you, mad as a hatter.
You sit here making plans for controlling a force that's beyond your comprehension.
A force that belongs only to the gods themselves.
What the hell are you talking about?
Things I'm sure you wouldn't want the world to know.
What's to stop me from having you erased right here and now?
Hmm!
My word that I've already made certain provisions that, should I disappear,
The Shop will cease to exist within six weeks.
And within six months, you will stand in front of a judge, awaiting sentence for crimes serious enough to keep you behind bars for the rest of your life.
Just... what is it you want?
Your word that my involvement with this child Charlene will not end when I bring her here.
That's just the beginning.
We're going to be friends.
- We haven't got her yet.
- We'll have her.
All right.
I guess we've got a deal, but why do you want her?
She's very beautiful. She's very young.
Yet inside her is the power of the gods.
We're going to be close, she and I.
Oh, yes.
Gonna be very close.
Reel in some of the slack out of the line.
Real slow, come on in, a little more.
OK, now give it a little tug.
Attagirl, now reel.
Yes, sirree! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- A real whopper.
- Lookee here. How about that?
(she laughs)
Here he comes.
Saved by the Postal Department.
Am I glad to see you?
I think we got a dead battery.
Could you give us a jump?
- Let's take a look at it.
- Thanks a lot, I really appreciate it.
Where will we go now?
Offices of "The New York Times."
- But you sent them a letter.
- Well, they might not have gotten it.
Do you think they took them?
No!
- I'll get it, baby.
- "(yells)" I can do it!
Baby, baby, come on, now.
It's almost over.
"(crying)" It's never gonna be over.
- It's not over.
- Come on.
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is. Come here.
(she weeps)
- Are you ready to go?
- I guess so.
Daddy, I'm never gonna start another fire in my life.
Even if they come before we can get away.
I'm never gonna hurt another person in my life.
That's OK, Charlie. I can understand that.
OK.
Jump.
That's a big girl.
OK...
Charlie? Charlie! Charlie!
Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh God!
They shot my daughter! "(echoes)"
Come on out where I can see you, you son of a bitch.
Baby.
Nothing to it.
Charlie!
She's all right, Mr McGee. Take it easy.
Where is she? I wanna see her.
All in good time. First, let's talk.
Let's get acquainted.
Go to hell.
I tell you, she's gonna be all right.
No. No.
- What do you want with us?
- I told you, Mr McGee.
We are going to be spending considerable time with each other and I want to introduce myself.
I'm Dr Pynchot.
I'm going to make sure you're treated well here.
Is this The Shop?
This is The Shop.
(bleeping)
Hi, Charlene.
- I'm Captain Hollister. May I come in?
- Where's my daddy?
I brought you some cocoa.
I don't want anything.
There's nothing to be afraid of. Here.
You see? Go on.
Well, maybe later.
I've been looking forward to meeting you for a long time.
I know you may not believe this but I've actually begun to think of you as my own daughter.
- What have you done to my father?
- He's resting and he's fine, just like you.
He knows you're all right and he sends his love and he wants you to cooperate with us.
You're a liar.
What kind of talk is that from a nice little girl like you?
- Go to hell!
- Oh?
A very stubborn nice little girl.
That's all right, I understand.
I know you're tired and you're not sure where you are.
So I just want to ease your mind, Charlie.
Do you mind if I call you Charlie?
All right, Charlene.
You are here because I'm very interested in this ability that you have.
Pyrokinesis.
Yes.
All of us here are interested in that and we want to see how far you can take it.
I'll tell you this, Charlie, you'll be doing this great country of ours a big favour if you cooperate.
I said I would never start another fire in my life. I wanna see my father.
OK.
Um...
Why don't you drink the cocoa and get some sleep?
If there's anything you want, just pick up the phone and let us know.
I know you'll find this hard to believe now, Charlie, but... you and me are gonna be pals.
Never.
Never say never.
I'll see you, Charlie.
(bleeping)
Good night, Charlie.
Just back off. Back off.
No!
You're not gonna do it.
Back off!
- Come on, take these pills.
- (he gags)
Come on, swallow.
(swallows, gasps)
- Now we have So Red So Beautiful.
- Look what I have here.
- A wind-up cat doll.
- "(music box plays)"
Listen to that, sweetheart.
Isn't that pretty?
Huh?
Sure you want this...
(video game music )
Hi, kid.
You go ahead with your game.
I'll start in the bedroom.
My name's John.
They call you Charlie, don't they?
Hey...
Hey...
You wanna teach me? I'm terrible at games. You can beat me all the time.
No.
Where's Charlie?
What are you doing with her?
She's perfectly all right.
There's nothing to worry about.
- Yeah, well, I wanna see her, goddamn it.
- Just behave yourself.
Do as we ask, we'll see.
You bastards.
Are you gonna do the test or not?
Oh, sure. Well, sure.
Good deal.
It's a one-way glass.
You won't see us but we'll see you.
All right, send him in.
- Hi, how are you?
- Having the time of my life. Sit down.
Did they tell you anything about what we're supposed to be doing in here?
All they told me was to come talk to you.
You look nervous.
Thirsty? Want some water?
Yeah, I'm thirsty.
You know, they mentioned something about a test.
- Uh-huh.
- You want some water?
No, I'll pass.
(yelps)
(groans)
Why don't you put some ink in it?
Put ink in it?
You gotta be crazy.
- Goddamn it.
- He's tipped over.
He's been on the run too long.
- All those damn pills haven't helped.
- Just give me time.
Rainbird's right.
He's lost it and time won't help.
Increase his medication.
I'll decide what to do with him later.
- Work on the girl.
- Oh, I am.
With a little luck, before long, she'll trust me like a brother.
(thunder)
(bleeping)
Hi, kid, how are you doing?
Why do you come here every day?
I'm not messy.
It's just my job, kid.
Because they're all full of shit. Why else?
(chuckles)
I wanna see my father.
Sure you do.
I wish I could help.
I don't even know where the man is.
This is a big place, Charlie.
They say they'll let me see him if I... if I do something.
- And I don't want to.
- "(chuckles)" Well...
Can it be that bad, what they want you to do?
I mean, if just by doing it, you can get to see your old man.
It is.
(thunder)
Storm's coming on. Sure hope those lights don't go off altogether.
No, sir, I wouldn't like that.
Hey...
Listen.
Are you scared by my face?
I mean,
I could wear a mask or something.
I've seen worse.
(door rattles)
Kid! Kid, please!
I can't stand the dark. Please, kid.
Kid!
- I gotta get outta here. Help me.
- Use your card.
All the electricity's gone. The card's no good. Hey, let me outta here.
Hey! Let me out!
- What's the matter?
- Let us out. There's people in here.
- Stop it, we're OK.
- "(he weeps)"
I mean, aren't we?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
It's just... the dark. I can't stand it.
It's just like the place they put me when I was captured.
- Who put you?
- The Cong.
- Who's the Cong?
- You mean to tell me...?
Oh, no, of course not, you're too young.
It was the war, see. Vietnam.
The Cong were the bad guys.
They wore black pyjamas.
In the jungle we were on patrol.
Walked into an ambush.
Only about six of us got out.
We ran.
Went the wrong way.
They caught me.
Threw me in a hole in the ground.
Like being buried alive.
It was always dark like this.
What did you eat?
They threw down rotted rice.
Sometimes I'd eat spiders.
Live ones. Big spiders. I'd chase them around in the dark and eat them.
Gross.
They turned me into an animal.
You got it easier than me, kid, but it all comes down to the same thing.
Like a rat in the trap.
You think maybe they'll get the lights back on pretty soon?
Doesn't matter. We're together.
God, kid. If some day I could help you the way you're helping me...
You could.
You could get a message to my father.
You know, what's it all about? Why do they have you and your daddy here?
What do they want you to do?
They won't make me take any more pills.
No more pills, you bastard.
How are you gonna help Charlie if you're a goddamn zombie?
Listen, maybe I could get in to see your dad?
- You could? You really think you could?
- I could change with Herbie, an orderly.
I could see your dad, tell him you're OK...
Maybe not tell him, pass him a note.
- Oh, thank you, thank you.
- Shit.
Maybe you oughta light the damn fires if you can.
I told you, it's like letting a wild animal out of a cage.
I promised myself I'd never do it again.
That men at the airport, those men at the farm, I killed them, I burned them up.
Yeah, but the way you told it, it sounded like self-defence.
Yes, but that's no excuse.
Also sounded like you saved your dad's life.
Look, if you do what they want you to do, only as much as you want to do, it might be the way for you to get out of here.
I'll help anyway I can.
Oh, my! Light.
Hold on here.
I'm sorry you got stuck with me in here, John.
But I'm awful glad too.
You look like you could use a little rest, huh? Come on, let's try.
Attagirl.
There we go.
That's the girl.
You just relax and you'll be asleep in no time.
And you'll have sweet, sweet dreams.
That's the girl.
- Good night, kid.
- Good night.
Daddy.
Now, Charlie, you know what you're supposed to do.
I want you to go in the other room. I don't want to have to look at you while I do this.
Something might happen.
Look at those alphas, she's really jacked up.
Everything all set? Tape rolling?
- Everything all right with her?
- Yes.
- You all set in there?
- Ready in here.
Are we ready here? Tape rolling?
- Rolling.
- All right. Everyone stand by.
Go ahead, Charlene.
Wood chips. They should've given me something harder.
Something's happening in there.
- Temperature just jumped ten degrees.
- "(bleeping)"
There it goes.
Her alpha patterns look like the goddamn Andes.
She did it. By God, she did it and we got it all on tape.
Back off. Just back off.
Back off.
Look at the tub.
Back off.
Did you see the water boil?
And the temperature?
- Jesus, did we get the audio?
- We got it.
Good deal. My God, did you see what she did? Did you see that?
My God, is there anyone here that has any doubt she didn't make that happen?
Not at all, Chief. None.
I knew something would happen but I had no idea.
That tray flew and she controlled it.
Then she put her power in the tub.
We got all on tape and it's good enough to stand up in court.
Right up in the Supreme Court.
What are you looking so miserable about?
You got her to do it by promising she could see her father again.
- She must never see him.
- We never intended to let her.
She'll never stop asking for it. Suppose by some strange accident they get together.
- Suppose they do.
- She does whatever he tells her.
Suppose he persuades her to destroy us all.
- No chance.
- There's always a chance.
He's right.
They can never see each other again.
Then you better send somebody along after her.
Huh?
Your technician must've had an appointment he forgot about.
He went out of here in a hell of a rush.
He also left the door open and your firestarter just walked out.
Christ.
One of you men go and get her.
Go on.
Sure.
Which of you would like to go and get the little girl?
- (knocking)
- Andy?
Here you go, buddy.
Oh, good.
Listen, Andy, we've determined that your power has deteriorated since you got here.
In fact, we've had no positive results at all.
What do you expect with all these drugs?
You expect me to do my best when I'm stoned?
I did everything I could. I tried.
I did everything I could.
Yes, of course I know that you have and believe me, I appreciate it very much.
In fact, I think you need a rest.
Did you know that The Shop has a small compound on the island of Maui, Hawaii?
How would it be if I sent you there for the immediate future?
- I still get my medication?
- Oh, sure, all you need.
- Well, that sounds nice.
- All right, good deal.
Then I'll get things started in that direction right away.
You just take it easy, kid.
We'll take care of everything.
(bleeping, door closes)
(groans)
She's so beautiful. What's her name?
"(laughs)" Actually, she's more of a boy.
His name is Necromancer.
What does necromancer mean?
I think it means something like wizard or sorcerer. Something like that.
They said if I did what they wanted, they'd let me see my father.
How did I know they were gonna be so damn stubborn? You have to do it again.
- But when will I ever stop?
- Look, baby.
It's like poker.
If you ain't dealing from strength, you ain't dealing.
Every time you light one of their fires, make sure you get something in return.
This is your old Uncle John talking, you understand me?
OK.
What about this power of yours?
You were awful scared about it before.
How'd you feel about it now?
It's different now. It's a lot stronger.
Yesterday, when I told it to back off, it did.
It was like I let it out in a single straight line and then...
- Then you pulled it back into yourself?
- Oh, no. I put it into the water.
If I pulled it back into myself,
I guess I'd burn up.
When am I gonna get to see my father?
Well, Charlie, we'll just have to give them enough rope.
Next time, there has to be more water.
Everything all set here?
Tape running? All right, stand by.
We're ready when you are, Charlene.
(cracking)
The temperature should be -26 degrees Celsius.
Plus or minus five degrees.
It's 40 in there.
- The blocks are starting to burn.
- Cinder blocks.
(cracking)
God.
Back off. Just back off.
Back off. Just back off.
Back off.
I wanna see my father.
You better tell her something.
Soon, Charlie.
When you show us a little more.
If you don't let me see him now,
I'll make something happen.
Do you hear me?
I'll make something happen.
(television)
(TV) Time for lunch.
Well, instant banquet.
Nice, table companion.
(Woody Woodpecker laughs)
I'm telling you, we're not through with testing her.
You saw what she's capable of.
She hasn't even reached her potential.
Perhaps Herman would like to see her blow up a country before he gives in.
I'm scientifically rational enough not to form an opinion based on two experiments.
I'm satisfied, yes, but only partially.
Have you made the arrangements regarding her father?
It's all taken care of.
Night, Doc.
Rainbird.
Have you considered what might happen if that girl found out whose side you're really on?
Oh, yes, I have.
I'd say you stand a good chance of finding out what a steak feels like in a microwave.
Would you shed a bitter tear?
No.
No point in lying to you about that.
When we find out all we need to know from her...
When you give her to me.
What are you gonna do with her?
John the friendly orderly will come in.
He will greet her, talk to her, get her to smile.
John the friendly orderly will make her happy cos he's the only one who can.
When John feels that she has reached the moment of her greatest happiness, he will strike her across the bridge of the nose, breaking it explosively, and sending bone fragments into her brain.
It'll be quick and he'll be looking at her face at the time.
He will know her power.
And when he dies, which I hope is very soon, perhaps he can take that power with him into the other world.
You are crazy.
"(Hollister)" I've made all the arrangements for you to go to Hawaii.
- Good. When am I going?
- Today.
- Today?
- Well, 8.00 this evening.
- How?
- First class comfort all the way.
I mean, what's taking me?
You go from here by helicopter to the base, then the rest of the way by army transport plane.
Hmm.
You know, that could bite you.
- What?
- That snake you're holding.
Christ, how did that get there?
I guess you just picked it up from a bush.
I want you to contact that helicopter pilot.
No.
- Hey, guard.
- Shut up.
Contact the pilot and tell him you'll be coming along.
I won't be coming along.
Yes, of course I'm coming along.
- My daughter will be with us.
- Oh, no.
She can't come. She's far too dangerous.
Oh, yeah? Well, who do you think made her dangerous?
My daughter is coming along.
I don't want you to contradict me again, do you understand?
Yes, of course.
You contact the helicopter and let him take us as far as the army plane.
There has to be a refuelling stop between here and Hawaii.
- We'll have to refuel in California.
- Yeah.
OK.
- Do you have paper and a pen?
- Sure.
Here you go.
I'm gonna write something to my daughter.
- You're gonna take it to her.
- Yes, of course.
Charlie, love.
First thing, when you finish reading this,
flush it down the toilet, OK?
Second thing,
if everything goes the way I'm planning,
we're gonna be out of here tonight.
Third thing,
I want you to be in the stables at 8.00.
I'll arrange for somebody to bring you.
I miss you, Charlie. I love you so much.
(bleeping)
- John!
- Hi, baby.
- I have to talk to you.
- Yeah, what about?
I'll tell you in the hall.
- They listen here.
- Right.
My daddy's found a way for us to get out of here.
I'm supposed to meet him at the stables at 8.00 tonight.
- That's great. How did he do it?
- I don't know, but isn't it wonderful?
Better. It's a miracle. I'll take you.
No, you'd get in trouble.
I wouldn't do that to you. You're my friend.
I appreciate that, Charlie, but I'd do anything for you.
(bleeping)
Hi, Charlie.
My name's Mike. Captain Hollister has assigned me to take you to the stables.
- What time?
- Well, let's see.
I'll be back for you about quarter to eight this evening.
So, what's going on?
- I asked if I could go riding at night-time.
- Oh?
Sure, kid, anything you want.
- Bye.
- See you later.
(whinneying)
Come to me, Charlie.
OK, let's check you in here.
Hey!
Anybody here?
- You can go now.
- I have the kid with me.
I said you can go now!
- Get out of here.
- Can't do it, Charlie.
Back off. Back off.
Get out of here, you bastard, or I'll burn you up, I'll fry you.
Charlie.
Charlie.
John? John?
- Where are you?
- I'm up here.
John...
I'm really glad you're here but if anybody found out...
That doesn't matter any more.
The only thing that matters is you and me.
How'd you get Charlie to cooperate?
- Rainbird got her to do it.
- Who's Rainbird?
He's an agent, an exterminator. Charlene thinks he's an orderly named John.
Come on up, Charlie. Come to John.
- My father should be here any minute.
- I know.
Hurry. Climb up now. Come to John.
That's it. Come on.
Good.
Good girl. Right...
- "(Andy)" Are you armed?
- "(Hollister)" Yes.
- Charlie?
- Daddy!
Yeah. Oh.
- Let me look at you.
- Is it true? Are we really going away?
Yes, it's true, we're really going away.
Baby.
- You pushed him.
- You're right.
- My friend John is here.
- The orderly?
Yeah, he's up there.
Couldn't we take him with us if he wants to come?
He's the one that shot us, baby.
He's the one that brought us here.
Oh, no, Daddy, that's John.
He took care of my room.
No.
He is with them.
- It isn't true, is it?
- Yes, it's true.
- Where are you, you son of a bitch?
- You tricked me, you lied to me.
No, I just mixed up the truth a little,
Charlie. And I did it to save your life.
You come down here before I set everything on fire, cos I can do it.
I know you can.
But if you do, you're gonna burn up an awful lot of horses.
Can't you hear them?
Necromancer's in one of those stalls.
No, I'm not gonna do it.
No, I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna burn.
No! Back off.
Please, don't. Back off.
You're not gonna do it.
Don't. Back off. Back off!
What more do you want from us?
Why can't you just let us go?
You can't just be let go. I don't think your father even believes that now.
- You're dangerous and you know it.
- That's not my fault.
I know that. I don't care about that.
I never did. All I care about is you.
Now, come up here!
Don't make me shoot your father.
- Don't listen to him, Charlie.
- You promise he'll be all right?
- I give you my real word.
- Don't do it, baby.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
Kill him.
Jump.
No.
No!
Oh, Daddy! Are you hurt?
- Charlie...
- Daddy! Daddy!
- You're bleeding.
- Charlie!
Daddy!
- Look at me.
- Go on.
Charlie, look at me.
That's it. So I can see your eyes.
I love you, Charlie.
I love you.
(screaming)
(over PA) I say again, Condition
Bright Yellow. This is not a drill.
Repeat, not a drill.
Converge on stables. Use caution.
It's the girl and she's using it.
You gotta get away if you can, Charlie.
If you have to kill anybody that gets in your way, I want you to do it.
You let them know that this is a war,
Charlie.
You have to get out of here.
Do it for me.
Do it for me, baby, do you understand?
You make it. You make it so they can't ever do anything like this again.
You'll have to burn it all down, baby.
Burn it all down.
Daddy...
Go on. Get outta here before it all goes up.
I can't leave you.
I can't leave you, Daddy.
Oh...
I love you, Charlie...
Oh, no, Daddy.
Get the door. Ready?
- Don't move.
- Freeze.
(screaming)
Oh, my God!
Get her! Get her!
- Run! Run for it!
- Let's go!
Come on, let's get out of here.
(screaming)
(screaming)
(yells)
No! No!
(screaming)
Take cover!
Take cover!
No... Stop!
No! No!
No! No!
(man) Attention!
Stay right where you are.
Do not move. We're coming down.
(screaming)
(screaming)
(screaming)
For you, Daddy.
- Irv, look who's here.
- Thanks for the ride.
"(lrv)" You'll be safe now, Charlie.
I'm doing it, Daddy.
I love you.

- Hey, Pete, are you sure this is the place?
You saw the letter.
This is the place.
Don't you think it's a little funny, I mean, your uncle giving you this race car?
- Sentimental reasons.
- Yeah.
Would a cracked block be a sentimental reason?
All we got to lay out is the storage fee.
You got the money.
I got the money.
All finished!
- Shine?
- No, thanks.
You are personally connected to a Puerto Vallartan.
Show you plenty good time!
- What do you think, Pete?
- It's not in the budget.
No, thanks, son.
Where do you want to go?
Paco'll show you. Free on the house!
- "Taller mecanico avenida. '"
- Cardenas.!
No problem.
I show you exactly.
I like Americans.
Americans very smart people.
Someday, I go to America.
When you do, you look up Pete Staniczek here.
He'll put you up, show you the best ice cream parlors.
That sounds good!
You see down there?
That's Avenue Cárdenas.
Turn left, that way.
Go two blocks, you'll find Mecanico.
Thanks.
De nada. Anytime! Welcome to Puerto Vallarta.
- Gracias.
- See you later, alligator.
Cute kid, d'ya know what I mean?
- Well mannered, polite, didn't have his hand out.
An endangered species.
- That light area, right around 400.
- I can see it.
- And you say this is Inca.
- You're the expert, you tell me.
Did anyone else spot this?
They were looking for oil.
And where is this?
In the jungles.
South America.
Mr. Shepard, there's nothing to be gained by our playing games.
This could very well be an undiscovered Inca city.
And you know what that means:
Pre-Columbian artifacts.
- And gold, Mr. Prindle.
- And what do you want?
Cash.
And plenty of it.
'Cause they're gonna throw the key away if they find us stealing that stuff.
Yeah, it's a national treasure, or something.
- Is there another print of this?
- That's it.
Gentlemen, we're in business.
There's gotta be some mistake.
Ah, no, senores.
No, senores.
This is not a mistake.
This is senor Douglas' car.
And you're telling me that this thing won the Monte Carlo Grand Prix?
That is what senor Douglas told me.
He say he'd have won the Baja race too... but his girlfriend... did not make the curve.
Herbie, he see it, he stop.
He no finish the race.
Senor Douglas say,
"it's here."
Let's turn it over.
La llave, senor.
- Okay, so it runs.
- Let's take it.
It's transportation home.
- Senor.
- Si, senor?
Mind if we take it around the block first?
Okay, senor.
Cute kid, huh?
Doesn't have his hand out.
He doesn't have his hand out because it's in your pocket.
You check that side.
See if you can find us a taxi.
- I'll get you a taxi, senor!
- Get lost, kid. Taxi!
All right, 1200, the National Hotel Bar.
I'll be there.
- Carry your bags, senor?
- Move along, sonny.
- No trouble. I carry your bags cheap!
- Put the bags down.
- I said, put the bags down!
- Hey, kid!
- Come on, get away from me, will ya?
- Taxi.!
Very sorry, senores.
Please, you forgive me!
He said he liked Americans and put his arms around us.
Then took us to the cleaners.
Never mind reenacting the crime.
Just look for the little...
There!
See that grubby little foot out behind that box?
A cold beer says it's attached to Paco the dip.
Shh. Shh.
Come back here, you little bandit!
- We need that worse than you do.!
- Don't scare him.! Talk to him nicely.!
Ooh!
Yee! Ah!
Buenos dias.!
Oh!
I'm sorry, lady.
We're looking for a little kid.
Did you see a little kid?
I'm sorry.
Me too, lady.
You look that way.
- What took you so long?
- It's not easy in this town.
Mr. Prindle, if you want to get in touch with me before, you can use this number.
- My wallet's gone.
- Maybe you left it up in the room.
It was that kid.
That crummy little kid!
Buenos dias.!
I don't know.
He must've skipped town.
No, he didn't.
This time we sack him.
You take him low,
I'll take him high.
- Oh, no, you don't!
- Is that yours?
- No!
- Is it ours?
- Si.!
- Grab loose of that.
- Nah, looks like that's all he got.
- I'll take over, dipstick.
I oughta tan your bottom!
Oh, I got another one
Look, there he is!
Hold it, kid!
- Wait a minute!
- Hold it, kid!
- Wait!
- Why? What we want's in that mailbox.
Let's get the kid first, just in case. Come on!
Somebody, stop that boy!
Stop that kid, someone.!
Hey, you, grab him.! Anybody.!
He's over here, come on!
Look up there!
Over here too!
- Busca alla arriba.
- Si.
Well, like you said, transportation.
Let's close the deal and get out of here.
There he is!
In the car!
What, are you planning to sleep over at the local jail, lead foot?
I'm not doin' anything!
- Maybe this bug did win the Grand Prix!
- We got ourselves a race car.
- This your wallet?
- Yes, Officer, thank you very much.
- Is something missing, senor?
- No, everything's fine.
It's all here.
We will continue looking for the car and the boy, of course.
Thank you, Officer.
We'll catch up with you.
Film's gone.
Why would a kid take it?
I don't know, we gotta get it back, though.
I'll never get another one.
Steady, boys! That's the car that's going to win the Grand Primeo at Brazil!
- Something's weird about that car, D.J.
- I know!
It's dynamite and it'll blow the doors off anything in the race.
Attention, please. Sun Princess will be embarking in 20 minutes.
We blew it.
The car's on the ship; the boy's on the ship.
- That thing's going to Rio.
- Its first stop is Panama.
When it gets there, we'll be waiting for it.
The booty was taken aboard the man-o'-war and the enemy vessel scuttled.
The women were then turned over to the crew... the select ones going to the officers, naturally.
The wenches were escorted below and, believe me, there was no poetry or "by your leave'"... or "how lovely you look, madam. '"
One got to the matter at hand in short order.
Each captive seaman was given 100 lashes with the cat...
- spread-eagled on the rigging.
- My dear Captain Blythe.
They didn't last long in those latitudes, I can tell you.
In no time at all, they were bloated carrion for the birds of prey.
Yah!
Oh, do have some of the green turtle soup, Mrs. Purkiss.
It's the chef's specialty.
Well, they'd no sooner broken out the grog... then the entire Spanish armada was closing on them.
Everything looks so tempting.
Yes.
Doesn't it?
They were met with stiff resistance as they clambered aboard.
- It was parry and thrust, thrust and parry.
- Uh, permit me.
- Thank you.
- Anyone else?
- Oh. No, thanks.
Where was I?
Well, the deck was awash with blood!
What are you gonna have?
I think I'll have that captain... on a bed of roses.
Blast of grape might sweep the deck clean.
- Aunt Louise, you're incorrigible.
- I know!
I've never regretted a moment of it.
Right this way, gentlemen.
My goodness, what a pleasant surprise.
Two handsome young gentlemen as our dining companions. I'm Louise Trends.
- DavyJohns.
- Pete Staniczek.
Pete, this is my niece Melissa.
Well, sit down, sit down.
Oh, just lucky,
I guess.
- You gentlemen going to Rio?
- Not exactly, ma'am.
Oh, I was telling Melissa...
Rio is a city of romance.
You really, to get the most out of it, have to share it with someone.
- Wasn't I, Melissa?
- Aunt Louise.
Well, personally, I won't have much time for that sort of thing.
I'll be utilizing every moment
I have copying down material for my doctorate.
You're gonna be a doctor?
Yes, of Latin American cultures.
Celery?
Cool it with the doctor bit.
Well, so what does take you gentlemen to Rio?
Actually, we're headed further south. We're entering a car in the Brazil Grand Primeo.
Pete here handles the wheel.
The rest is my lookout.
- You're a race driver.
- Yeah.
Oh, isn't that fascinating!
- Oh, I love race cars, don't you, Melissa?
- Not really.
Well... hungry?
Ah!
Ahh.
Ah! Here we go.
Buon appetito, eh?
Ah!
But I checked the pressure five minutes ago. Everything is fine.!
Number one, okay.!
Yes, I know how Capt. Blythe is... but I tell you, the dial is right on the nose. I see it for myself.
Who take-a my chicken?
Aha! So you think you can steal
Armando's dinner and get away with it?
We're gonna see about that.
Oh, yes.
Okay. Open up.
Open up, little car.
No car's gonna eat my dinner.
Open up. I tell you!
Open up!
Aha! Heh-heh-heh!
Open up.
Open up.
You can't drive that car down here.
This is the number one hold.
Some of your cargo, it's-a broke loose!
Send your officer watch down here fast, no, but I mean real fast! Si.
- Hey, what's going on?
- That car has no driver!
Better notify
Captain Blythe!
Shh.! All right, men.
Spread out and be careful.
Psst!
Now.!
And I am to believe that this... car... ate your chicken dinner?
Eh, and then he spit out the bones!
- Who is this?
- Wiper, third class,
Armando Moccia, sir.
Do you know the penalty for drinking on duty... wiper, third class?
Armando not touch one drop. No, please!
The car ate my apple.
I know because I hear with my own ears!
Eh! Muncha-muncha-munch!
Muncha-muncha-munch, eh?
- Do you know what I'm going to do with your ears?
- Uh, where is the car now?
- Went for a drive after dinner.
Oh. And was it smoking a cigar and drinking a brandy?
The perpetrator of this little jest will receive 50 lashes...
- before ship's company and set adrift in a...
Perhaps you'll be good enough to tell me about your grandson
Snooky another time.
Wiper, third class, Armando Moccia?
Aye-aye, sir.
Ah!
Okay, men, secure it.
Get the blocks and make it good.
Capitane.
Muncha-muncha-muncha! Si.!
See? Hah!
Now.
- How did you want to handle that?
- You mean pay for it?
Or did you plan to, uh, reassemble the stemware yourself?
It's not our responsibility.
I'm your captain, judge and jury.
I'll decide what's your responsibility!
Captain!
The, uh, the cargo manifest states unequivocally... that you, Peter Staniczek, are the sole owner of the car.
You are the consignor and the consignee.
Your car did damage, ergo...
- Yeah, but Pete wasn't driving...
- Stow it!
I, uh, I have been advised by our public relations department... to waive all charges of kidnapping... and smuggling illegal aliens into a foreign country.
- Where is that kid, anyway?
- In the storeroom... where he'll remain until the ship reaches Panama... at which time he will be turned over to the port authorities... and returned to his native country.
In the meantime, your automobile will be impounded... until your obligations are met.
Captain.
Uh, gentlemen...
I do hope you've been enjoying the cruise so far.
Remember, we have a shuffleboard tournament on main deck at four bells... and, uh, disco lessons in the lounge at six bells.
Thanks, anyway.
We can write the captain an
I.O.U. And pay him out of our winning at the Grand Primeo.
There's no way we can raise that kind of money.
Maybe we should chalk it up to experience and work our way home.
- Maybe Aunt Louise will bail us.
- You are a dreamer, D.J.
Wait a minute.
She likes cars and she's trying to get her niece hooked up.
Yeah?
- No!
- Wait a minute.
All you gotta do is keep the doc enthralled with tales of derring-do... while I initiate Aunt Louise into the delights of Formula One racing.
- I don't like it.
- Come on, man! Nothing good comes easy.
Lots of charm, lots of charm.
You may not believe this, this is an exact replica, down to the last button... of the uniform worn by Lord Nelson when he defeated the Spanish armada.
- Seems like it belongs on me, doesn't it?
- I love a uniform.
It gives a man a certain...
- At ease, madam!
- Captain!
Excuse me, I must circulate among the cargo... uh, passengers.
Anyway, like I was saying, it's the thrill of a lifetime... when you see that car that belongs to you streak across that finish line a winner.
Not only that, you're part of the technological advancement of the automotive world.
- Oh, really.
- Mm-hmm.
I wonder... where the kids are.
Now isn't that...
In my heart and my hand
I've never seen
- They seem to be enjoying themselves.
- Yeah, they're hitting it off.
Pete's a great guy.
He's what I call a beautiful person.
With your head up in a cloud
Where you belong
Please look at me lf I stay around
Maybe something good will happen
Like you'll look into my eyes
And realize
My kind of racin'.
Oh, pardon me.
That's the third time I've done that.
Who's counting?
I'm having a great time.
- Are you really?
- Yeah.
And so
Usually when we race, a good time means towing the crew across Texas... in the middle of August, looking for a Denny's... then bedding down in some fleabag motel.
Now here I am... soft lights, sweet music... pretty girl.
Uh, Mr. Staniczek, you don't really have to say those things.
Oh, I know that. It's just that you're different than other girls I've known.
- I can well imagine.
- No, no, it's a compliment.
For one thing, you don't giggle when there's nothing funny.
And you listen when I talk.
A man looks a long way for a girl like that.
And, uh...
And maybe then
- Our fingers touch
- You are pretty, Melissa.
And you'll thrill me oh, so much
A lovely dream
That's meant to be lf you would give
One look
At me
Ah, this is it.
I just want to thank you for this evening.
- L-I really enjoyed myself.
- Me too.
Well, good night.
Melissa?
- This is the pits.
- Did something go wrong?
We went wrong when we got into this.
I don't like playing games with people.
Come on, just a couple more days.
I already got the money.
Aunt Louise gave me a check.
We got the car out of hock.
And get this, kiddo.
She's gonna sponsor us all the way.
We name it, she buys it.!
All you gotta do is keep making like Burt Reynolds.
- So, that's the deal.
- Well, I sorta read it between the lines.
Anyway, the important thing is we're back in the running.
Ahh! Nothing's gonna stop us now.
Hi!
- That captain sure was mad, wasn't he?
- Honk!
- What is he gonna do with you?
- Honk-honk-honk.
They will send me back where I live... with the orphans.
But it's okay.
They put me back, I run away again.
- Can we be friends?
- Honk.
- What's your name?
- Honk-honk.
- Que?
- Honk-honk.
- I just call you "Ocho," okay?
- Honk-honk.
Atta boy, Ocho!
Thanks, Ocho.
I'll pay you back.
But you better go back where you were, so you won't get in trouble.
Oh-oh!
There it goes!
Don't let it get out of this hold, men!
Check over by the elevator, men.!
In those days, a captain was a captain.
And a ship was a ship, not a floating carnival.
And the only women aboard were dragged there by the scruff of their neck!
Whoo, gives me goose bumps just thinking about it.
The captain is having a little jest with you ladies.
I'm only telling it like it was.
Or should be.
Yes, when you talked about liberation in those days... you were talking about battles... nations, empires.
Oh! Oh!
Oh, Captain.
Oh, my word.!
Sorry!
But, Captain, how can a car release a boy with a key? Explain that!
I can't explain that any more than I can explain the Bermuda Triangle, madam.
Nor do I intend to try.
Captain, I am the sponsor of that little car.
It's going to win the Brazil Grand Primeo.
If you can bring that off,
I will not only part the Red Sea...
I will tint it magenta.
Oh, oh, Captain.
I appeal to you as a woman... a desperate, helpless... single woman.
Spare that car.
Lorelei and her sirens could not make me veer one degree!
- My course is set!
- Oh!
Ship's company!
Stand to to witness punishment!
Sir, the passengers might not understand.
I am simply abiding by the traditions of the sea...
Chief Steward.
By the powers vested in me as the captain of this ship...
I hereby deem this vehicle a menace... to life and limb and the very safety of the vessel itself.
I herewith commit it to the sea... a fate well-deserved.
Doff hats!
Seamen... do your duty.
- You too?
- Oh, bag and baggage.
Anyone remotely associated with that little car is being put ashore.
If it hadn't been for that steward, we'd have been keelhauled.
- Sorry it turned out like this.
- If I decided to get out of needlepoint... and into racing, it was my choice.
- Actually, there's more to it than that.
- Steady, steady.
We needed backing, so D.J.
Pitched you on the car while... l...
Pitched my niece on the fantail.
I've got too much mileage on me not to recognize... an operation when I see one.
You mean you knew that?
Well, I was hoping that... something might happen between you and Melissa.
She's really a wonderful girl.
She's terrific but...
A little klutzy for someone like yourself.
Not everybody's made for each other.
I really like her and I don't want her to get hurt.
I plan to tell her but maybe you can smooth things over.
- Here's your bag, miss.
- Thank you.
Melissa, there you are!
I was just looking...
- You meet such interesting types on ships.
- Melissa!
Sorry, boys.
Come on, pal.
How do you say in Panamanian... we need a job?
Excuse me. I don't know where you're taking this boy, but I have prior claim on him.
- Are you from Juvenile Authority?
- Yes, I am.
- No, he's not!
- Aah!
- Aah!
We'll handle this!
- Grab that kid!
- Stop that kid!
He's wanted by the police!
We gotta get that kid!
We'll get him.
Tom, you better come take a look at this.
What the devil is that?
I don't know. Supposed to be the Major Maroux.
Ocho?
Ocho!
I'm coming, Ocho,
I'm coming!
- Ayudame, andale.!
- Vamonos.!
What is the matter, muchacho?
- It's an old wreck.
- But he was my good friend.
Your friend is good for nothing but junk.
Hey, even junk... worth something.
Bye, Ocho.
Vaya con Dios.
Ocho!
Come on, Ocho, you can do it. Try, try!
Please, Ocho, come on!
Don't give up now, please, please.!
Try, try!
I help you!
It's those men.
Come on, you gotta start!
You're whippin' a dead horse, muchacho.
We gotta get outta here!
This is our car now!
Go play someplace else.
Sal de ahi, muchacho.
Ay.!
You feeling better, Ocho.
A friend
It takes one to be one
Takes some time 'til the light starts shinin'
On a friendship
A friend
Step up if you need one
Stick out your hand
They should understand it's a friendship
A buenos dias
Come on, try
A pat on the back
A wink of the eye
That's what friends are for and remember this, charro
They'll stick with you today and tomorrow
Amigo
It's nice if you've got one
But it's nicer if you're not one to stop
From lookin'for more
The world is full of people who need you so much
A million hearts there to touch
And I bet you a banana
Manana you'll have a new friend
And I bet you a banana
Manana you'll have a new friend
A friend
It's nice when you see one
But it's nicer when you be one
You look good, Ocho, like a real taxi.
Now we're gonna make lots of money.
Then Paco will never have to take nothin'from nobody again.
Just relax, sonny.
- Now, where is it?
- Where's what?
There was some film in the wallet you took from us in Puerto Vallarta.
When we got it back, it was missing.
- Where is it?
- I don't know. Maybe it got mixed-up.
- What do you mean, "mixed-up"?
- With the other man's wallet.
He's lying.
Maybe, maybe not.
Now you listen to me.
I want that film back.
I don't care how you do it, just get it back!
Because if you don't... he's gonna cut this car of yours up into tiny, little pieces.
You understand, kid, huh?
Little strips to hang on your Christmas tree?
Comprende?
Si.
You know, Pete,
I was just thinking.
Do you realize that that car could've put us in the big time?
We could've been international celebrities.
You know what I mean?
Endorsements, groupies chasin' after us.
It's that kid.
Murphy's Law took over from the time we ran into that brat.
Hi, guys.
Speaking of four-foot crime waves.
I come to say, I sorry if I make trouble for you.
Yeah, well, fine.
See you around.
Paco go. I just want you not be mad at me.
Now don't start that.
Nobody's mad.
It's water over the dam.
I'm sorry.
Please, you forgive me?
Fine, kid, no hard feelings.
Forget it.
Straight back there, through that hallway and to the right.
Gracias.!
Gloriosky! Just makes you feel good all over.
He did it again.
Come back here, you little bandit!
Hey, that's our car.!
- How can that be our car?
- I don't know. Let's get him!
We better get outta here, or those guys are gonna get you back!
Shepard's ready.
He's got the plane.
Good.
Here comes the boy.
Why, that little, double-crossing... Come on!
Taxi!
Taxi!
Taxi.!
Taxi.!
Let me get in here.
It's a little tight.
Pardon moi, senor.
- Pier 6, the Sun Princess.
- Pier 5, the Windsong, please.
- You!
- You!
- I'm terribly sorry,
- I'm terribly excited... but it's imperative I return to my ship immediately.
I'd be so pleased...
- You can have the cab after that!
- Thank you.
- The Sun Princess.
- The Windsong, please.
We're in real trouble now, Ocho.
And full steam ahead.!
Where in blazes are you going, driver?
No comprendo, senor.
You people comprendo enough when you want to!
Wait a minute.
It's that same kid!
And here's the biggie:
I think it's the same car.
It's a ghost.
Let me outta here!
Let me outta here, or it's the yardarm for you!
Can't stop now, senor.
- Look!
- Oh! Uh...
- Melissa! Melissa!
- Help, help!
Help!
I'm being shanghaied!
Help, Melissa.!
Help!
I'm being shanghaied!
The kid, he robbed us again!
- He shanghaied them.
- Shanghai?
Senor, stop!
Could you please stop?
Por favor, alto.!
Por favor, alto.
Please stop.
Por favor, senor.!
Muchas gracias.
- How much?
- How far you want to go?
No, how much for the whole bus?
Huh?
Is $340 enough?
Lady, you got yourself a bus!
Next bus, please.
Todos para fuera.
Acabo de vender el bus.!
Now, listen to me, son.
If you don't release me this instant...
I'll have you tied to a cannon to be discharged at sunset.!
I can't stop.
Two men said that they would cut up Ocho in little pieces... and two other men are very mad at me.
Is that banging noise new?
Just louder.
It might throw a rod.
- Uh, is that serious?
- Not if it happens in front of a hotel.
Are we still in Panama?
- Panama's long gone, capitan.
- What? Let me out of here.!
Can't, capitan.
There's some men after me!
No, Ocho, not in there!
- Olé!
- What was that?
We're at the bullfights, capitan.
Oh, this is exciting.
- I think it will be, senora.
- What did he mean by that?
God bless you.
Turn in there!
- This can't be right.
- Back up!
Oh!
We're goin'in.!
- What are we gonna do?
- Just ignore him.
Saquen esos carros de la plaza.!
Vamonos, hombre.!
Pero saquense de aqui. Estan locos.
Pero orale, afuera, hombre.!
Come on, get it off the car!
Come on!
Oh... Oooh!
Alto, ya parenle, basta, ya basta.!
Please get us out of here, kid.
I'm not asking for myself, but I'm very worried about this lady.
- How thoughtful!
- Just shut up!
- Pasen por esa puerta, rapido.!
- Si, senor policia.
That first gangway.! Move it.!
Aaah!
Get goin Ocho.!
Aaah!
Ay, que viene el toro.!
- We're stopped. Where's the bull?
- There he is.
What a magnificent animal.
- I think you can see him better from here.
- Aaah!
Aaah!
Hey, Ocho, we gonna let him get away with that?
Yes, you are!
Let's get out of here!
Scat, scat, scat.!
Ocho, he's gonna kill ya!
You just can't stand here doin' nothin'!
You gotta fight!
Take a good look at him!
He's a killer.!
- He is going to fight.
- That-a-boy, Ocho!
I can't believe this.
Thirty years at sea, and I'm going to die in a bullring.
Hey, toro, toro.!
Toro.! Hey, toro.!
Toro, toro.!
- No toros! Shhh!
- Toro.!
Toro, toro.!
Andale, toro, aqui.!
Hey, toro.!
Good, Ocho!
That-a-boy, Ocho!
Stay with him!
Ole, Ocho.!
Atta boy, Ocho!
You take him now!
Look, son, I want you to know that I think of you as my son.
If you get us out of here, I'll make you first mate of the Sun Princess.
You and your little car can stay in a nice suite... and eat at my table every night.
The big boat will take you anywhere you want to go, okay?
Don't worry, capitan, we got him now!
Over here, toro.!
Over here!
Ole.!
Hey, toro, toro.!
That-a-boy, Ocho!
He's getting awfully close, Ocho.!
- Aaah!
- I'm going to be sick.
They got voodoo down here, you know that?
Ole! Ole!
He's had enough. Let's go.
Come on.
They want us to take a bow, all of us!
Oh, wait.
Come out.
Nothing in this world will induce me to go out there.
They'll be disappointed.
Don't pull on me!
Don't do that!
Mmm! Ahhh!
You too, capitan.
Take a bow!
Oof!
What's wrong, Ocho?
Oh!
Wait a minute!
- I told you.
- Let's get Shepard and the plane!
Captain, the boy!
That boy's in trouble!
Help him! Help!
- Can't we go any faster?
- We could, but we'd have to walk.
The fact that we're moving at all violates... every principle of the internal combustion engine.
Hey, wait a minute.
It's Aunt Louise.
And Captain Blythe?
Aunt Louise, are you all right?
Ecstatic.
Well!
We just fought a bull, and brought it to a standstill.
Looks like you lost, Captain.
Reverse your course.
We have to find that boy.
There's some men after him.
What if he doubled-back on us?
We'd have seen him.
There's only one road around here.
Just keep looking for that crazy car.
He doesn't understand "bracket."
All right, then, get some wire.
- Wire, wire.
- Wire?
- Wire, uh, wire.
- Wire.
Sounds like "fire."
Ah, si.!
Fuego, si.
- He's gonna get some.
- Thank you.
- Uh...
- Fuego.
Um, senor, no.
Mm-mm.
- The Sun Princess.
- Como se llama?
Tell the mate I've been stranded in Timbio.
No puedo.
No le entiendo.
- The Sun Princess! It's a ship!
- Sheep.
- Now... No, not a sheep. It's a ship.
- Princesa es sheep.
Not sheep. That's "baa-baa"!
This is "toot-toot"!
- No comprendo, no.
- What do you mean, "no comprende"?
In St. Augustine, not far from here... they have monolithic statues that are...
Well, they go back to 500 B. C... but nobody knows who made them or where they came from.
I wish I could help you.
I'm sure you'd find a cold six-pack much more exciting.
Oh, now, have I hit on something that you hold dear and sacred?
Look, I led you on.
I apologized.
Oh, please, don't.
Well, I'll just have an electrocardiogram when I get home.
But I can assure you, there's been no damage.
We're wasting valuable time bickering.
Who knows what's happened to that boy by now?
I'll just see what's holding up the captain.
Why are you all staring at me?
It's a conspiracy!
What?
Si, sesenta centavos.
Siesta centavos.
Don't go away.
I'll get it for you.
- Siesta centavos.
- Sesenta centavos, senor.
- Three minutes more cost you more money.!
- Siesta centavos.
Oh, here.
Yes, we're getting it for you.
I beg you, don't hang up.
Yes, I'll be right with you.
I love your country.
It's very colorful.
Your children have such expressive faces.
Look alive with that change, woman!
Please don't go away.
I'll get it for you.
Are you still there?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello!
She's gone.
It took me two hours just to get the operator... and she's gone, just like that.
- Oh.
- Hello?
Oh, yes, de nada.
How will I explain this to the company?
You just tell Aunt Louise all about it.
- They'll take away my command.
- Yes, oh.
- They'll take away my sheep.
- Oh, your sheep.
I think we lost 'em, but one thing I still can't figure out
Why would those men want a picture like this, Ocho?
It's kinda lonely around here, huh, Ocho?
Honk-honk.
When we're safe from those men... we'll go back where there's lots of people, huh, Ocho?
Honk!
We've got him.!
Why don't we force him off the road?
Because we just might come off second best.
Well, what's a bug and a kid gonna do?
Something quite unexpected,
I assure you.
We'll wait 'til it stops.
Will it make
Chiclayo?
Not a prayer.
- How long do you give it?
- About a minute.
We should alert the captain.
He'd want to know about this.
He'll be alerted, any second now.
Sound general quarters!
- Captain!
- It's every man for himself!
Have you put out distress signals?
Oh, we will.
Five of them.
Maybe we can go to Santiago and work there, Ocho.
Those men'll never find us there.
Don't worry, Ocho.
I'll take care of ya.
Oye, nino. El senor en la cantina necesita un taxi.
- Andale, pronto. Apurate.
- Si.!
Wake up, Ocho!
A man in the cantina needs a taxi.
We can siesta later.
- Someone want a taxi?
- Just the driver.
Ow! Let go!
Let me go.!
No! Let me go!
Aaah!
Ocho!
Ocho!
Ocho!
Let me go.!
Help.!
Ocho!
Bye-bye.
How's it going?
I'm telling them not to hold the ship at Port au Spain... but go directly to Tobago, where I'll join them there.
I hate to think of what's happened to that ship in my absence.
Get this off immediately.
It goes to the Communication
Center of the Sun Princess.
Are you certain that the pigeon understands that?
Si, senor capitan.
He certainly knows his pigeons.
There's an airport in Chiclayo, about 12 miles further on.
But there's no transportation from here to Chiclayo.
It's the same car.!
I was so worried.
Thank heavens.!
It's the same car, but where's the boy?
I think he wants to tell us something.
It's a car, woman, not Lassie.
- Where is Paco?
- Honk-honk-honk.
I know something terrible's happened to him. Come on.
Get in, everybody.
Get in!
I am not getting into that sardine can again!
- It's a 12-mile walk to Chiclayo, so make up your mind.
- And hurry!
- Get in here!
- Ow!
Oh! Aaah!
What about that down there?
Yeah, that could be it.
Gentlemen, we're right on the money.!
Together now, pull.!
What do you think?
Gold.!
Probably pure gold.!
More than that, it has tremendous archaeological value.
- Do you think there's more?
- Plenty.
What do we do with it?
I say we get this outta here now... then come back with tools and do it up right, okay?
You got it.
- What about me?
- Get outta here!
Aaah!
I don't like leavin' that kid back there.
Don't worry about him.
He's not goin'anywhere.
Does anyone know where we are?
The car does.
I'm sure of it.
Well, ask it, will you?
I would, but we're not on speaking terms.
This is ridiculous.
Somebody ought to do something.
- We'd better just sit tight.
- Easy for you.
Aaah!
Ocho!
Paco, what are you doing here in the middle of the jungle?
- We were worried sick about you.
- Those men, they were stealing gold.
Big gold, like this.!
- Where'd they get gold?
- Right there. It looks like Inca ruins.
Si. It's Inca. They will fly away the gold and they will melt it. I hear them.
I'll see that the matter is brought to the attention of the proper authorities... when we put in at Rio.
That might be too late.
Go, Ocho.!
What's that?
Come on, give us a hand!
Let's keep movin'!
Oh, no.!
It's that car.!
It ate it.!
It ate the gold.!
How'd it get out here?
- There goes a million bucks.
- No way.
Seven hundred miles on a banana boat with wheels.
I'll be laughed off the Caribbean.
It worked, didn't it?
Those men in the airplane, they couldn't find us.
It was a good idea, Paco.
How much farther?
We're practically there.
Okay, get ready to peel off.
Hmm, sorry.
We're looking for
Dr. De Moraes'offce.
He's upstairs, in the main building.
I'll call the police.
Hello.
You go on.
I'll wait here.
Aaah!
May I use your phone?
It's very important. Oh, thank you.
Hey!
Are you going towards the sea?
It's vitally important
I return to my ship!
Wait, wait!
Dr. De Moraes?
Yes?
Oh, Dr. De Moraes... you have no idea what we've gone through to get this to you.
And what we've gone through to get it from you.
When we couldn't find you on the highway... we decided that you'd either gone to the nearest police station... or to the world's foremost authority on Inca civilization.
I guessed right.
Nice, ripe bananas.
They're good for brains.
Get 'em while they last.
Very cheap.
Nice, ripe bananas.
Let's make a deal on a peel.
Let's do this thing together.
We don't want this to get away from us.
Ocho, listen. Sounds like the airplane those men had!
Let's go see!
They can't do anything.
Come on.
Ocho, what are we gonna do?
They're taking the gold!
Atta boy, Ocho!
Wh-Wh-Whoa!
Sorry, boss.!
Get this thing off of me!
Hit 'em again,
Ocho!
You idiot!
- Hey, come on! Hurry up!
- Get this thing off of me!
Give me that thing!
I can't get a grip on it.!
Let's do this scientifically.
Pull! Push!
Cut it out, will ya?
Get off of my foot!
Help me get it to the plane.
I can't see!
Whoa!
Hurry up, pilot!
Ready... fire.!
Say what you want about voodoo... but where I come from, cars don't throw bananas.
Just get it in the plane!
Ocho, they're getting away.
Hurry!
Come on, let's get this thing outta here!
With this extra weight, I'm gonna need the whole field to take off!
Well, hurry up!
Here it comes again!
You think he's gonna try and hijack us?
Anything's possible with that thing.
Get 'em, Ocho!
Stay with 'em!
- I wonder what it's gonna do now.
- I don't know.
Well, take off!
- Come on, take off!
- I'm trying!
- Right on our tail.
- I think he's tryin' to chew it off.
Do we need one?
Now, Ocho, get him!
Don't let go!
That-a-boy!
Shake 'em, Ocho!
Shake 'em, man.
I can't take off with all that weight in the tail. Go get it!
- Catch it when I raise the tail.
- Gotcha.!
Aaah!
Go for it, Ocho, now!
Hang on!
Shake it off!
Come on, Ocho, you can't give up now!
They're getting away!
He's going to ram us.!
- Aaah!
- Do something!
- Why are we going in circles?
- Because he broke my tail, that's why!
Now get in front of'em!
Make 'em stop!
Get this thing off the ground!
We're gonna hit him!
Pull up!
She's stalling.!
They're still going, Ocho!
- What's the matter?
- The throttle jammed open!
My wings!
You hurt, Ocho?
You don't sound so good.
Don't quit now.
You can do it!
- Can you step it up?
- I'm hurrying.
- Move your feet forward.
- I got it, I got it.
Uh, uh...
Policia.!
I'm so glad you're here.
I was the one who called you.
Stay with 'em!
Go, go!
Can't you make this thing go any faster?
The oil pressure's down.
I don't want to ruin my plane.
They got the gold!
Stop! You'll never get away!
We're right behind you!
Okay, Ocho, you got 'em now!
Give it to 'em!
Whoa!
- You did it!
- Paco, Paco.
That's him!
Paco, are you all right?
Ocho and me, we okay.
You ought to see those other guys.
No se muevan.
Quedense ahi.
Todos ustedes, salganse de ahi.
Salganse de ahi, les digo.
Yno se muevan.
Gorgeous!
Just magnificent.
I've always felt, Captain, that you have a... deep appreciation for beauty.
I've never seen anything like it.
Any man of the sea who wouldn't want her rolling under him... is ready for dry dock!
Wow!
Magnificent!
I'm not admitting the kid's a better driver than I am... but he sure can get more out of that car than I can.
- And they're really...
- Simpatico.
Yeah, simpatico.
Well?
If I had billowed out like a schooner under full sail...
I might have... shivered his timbers.
- I hope we win this one.
- Don't you worry, Aunt Louise.
This is the car that's gonna win the Grand Primeo of Brazil.
That's right.
Drivers, start your engines!
Paco, muy bueno.!
Looking good, Ocho!
Why do you keep calling this car "Ocho"?
"Ocho" means eight.
Can't you read the numbers?
Sure I can read the numbers.
Five and three are eight.
Anyone knows that.
Let's have a toast.
To victory in Rio.
Victory in Rio.!
A friend
It takes one to be one
Takes some time 'til the light starts shinin'
On a friendship
A friend
Step up if you need one
Stick out your hand
They should understand it's a friendship
A buenos dias
Come on, try
A pat on the back
A wink of the eye
That's what friends are for and remember this, charro
They'll stick with you today and tomorrow
Amigo
It's nice if you got one
But it's nicer if you're not one to stop
From lookin'for more
The world is full of people who need you so much
A million hearts there to touch
And I bet you a banana
Manana you'll have a new friend
F-R-E-N-D
Friend
[2436][2471]/that many worlds|/have been enslaved by the Beast...
[2471][2501]/and his army, the Slayers.
[2501][2535]/And this too|/was given me to know...
[2535][2561]/that the Beast would come|/to our world...
[2561][2586]/the world of Krull...
[2586][2617]/and his Black Fortress|/would be seen in the land...
[2617][2647]/that the smoke of burning villages...
[2647][2666]/would darken the sky...
[2666][2714]/and the cries of the dying|/echo through deserted valleys.
[2714][2754]/But one thing I cannot know...
[2754][2778]/whether the prophecy be true...
[2778][2816]/that a girl of ancient name|/shall become queen...
[2816][2845]/that she shall choose a king...
[2845][2883]/and that together|/they shall rule our world...
[2883][2905]/and that their son...
[2905][2948]/shall rule the galaxy.
[3080][3107]Father.
[3123][3143]Colwyn should have been here by now.
[3143][3182]/He may be forced to travel through|/the forests and the stone country.
[3182][3211]/All the passes and roads|/are held by the Slayers.
[3211][3239]/Colwyn may not get through.
[3239][3274]/- That would please you?|/- I sent men to help.
[3274][3310]/But I see no reason for an alliance|/with our ancient enemies.
[3310][3341]/Father, the invaders|/are destroying our world.
[3341][3372]/We must have the alliance.
[3372][3406]/Only if we're united|/do we stand a chance against them.
[3406][3436]/Then I'll make a treaty|/with King Turold.
[3436][3460]/It's not necessary|/for you to marry his son.
[3460][3503]/It's the only way|/to guarantee the alliance.
[3503][3526]/The marriage is my choice.
[3526][3560]If it were anyone but Turold's son...
[3560][3581]Colwyn is a great fighter.
[3581][3621]Good fighters make bad husbands.
[3621][3649]Perhaps.
[4017][4044]Horsemen approaching!
[4044][4079]Open the gates!
[4199][4223]We sent to you for help!
[4223][4254]None came.|Twenty men were dispatched to you.
[4254][4285]We lost 300 getting here.
[4285][4310]I didn't choose this marriage, Turold.
[4310][4341]- Nor did I, Eirig!|- I chose it.
[4341][4373]Your daughter chose it.|It'll be done.
[4373][4407]And you'll lead this army with mine|against the Slayers?
[4407][4436]Whatever army I have|I'll lead against them...
[4436][4483]until I've won or I'm dead.
[4683][4720]I've chosen well.
[4720][4750]So have I.
[4764][4791]Your journey was hard?
[4791][4814]But necessary.
[4814][4881]- May already be too late.|- It's not too late.
[4891][4928]Is this where the ceremony will be?
[4928][4972]Mm, tonight at moonrise.
[4984][5027]My father says|that good fighters make bad husbands.
[5027][5057]- That depends.|- On what?
[5057][5086]On whether you expect a husband|to follow you around...
[5086][5107]jump every time you clap your hands.
[5107][5142]Wouldn't you jump for me?
[5142][5198]No, of course not.|You're a warrior.
[5497][5537]- From this day, my kingdom is no more.|- Nor mine.
[5537][5556]A single kingdom...
[5556][5575]under our children.
[5575][5602]Agreed.
[6432][6469]I give fire to water.
[6469][6562]It will not return except from the hand|of the woman I choose as my wife.
[6605][6634]I take fire from water.
[6634][6708]I give it only to the man|whom I choose as my husband.
[6760][6807]Take the fire from my hand.
[6902][6930]Slayers!
[6967][6992]Call the royal guards!
[6992][7005]- The Slayers.|- Arm yourselves!
[7005][7033]- We will fight together.|- Is there a safe way out of the castle?
[7033][7089]- An underground passage.|- Come on!
[7176][7199]- My place is with you.|- Do you love me?
[7199][7232]- Of course I love you.|- Then go.
[7232][7260]Colwyn, hurry back to me.
[7260][7325]Everyone in the center of the room,|get back!
[7801][7829]Take it!
[8197][8222]Here!
[8762][8788]Lyssa!
[8867][8894]Father!
[10293][10316]- Lyssa!|- She's alive.
[10316][10342]- Where?|- Stay still!
[10342][10400]- Where?|- For now, beyond your reach.
[10428][10475]- Who are you?|- I am Ynyr.
[10477][10498]The old one.
[10498][10516]Well...
[10516][10542]not as old as all that.
[10542][10564]You've come down|from the Granite Mountains.
[10564][10605]Yes. I am needed now.
[10734][10761]Father.
[10776][10827]There is no time now for grief.
[10848][10884]You haven't lost a father|and a bride on the same day.
[10884][10928]Nor have I become king on that day.
[10928][10952]I have no kingdom!
[10952][10980]Your kingdom may be greater|than you know.
[10980][11018]I give it to you, old man,|and welcome to it.
[11018][11055]I came to find a king.
[11055][11100]And I find a boy instead.
[11166][11192]Lyssa?
[11197][11258]They will hold her|in the Black Fortress.
[11283][11331]- Can you lead me to it?|- You must have help.
[11331][11361]I'll find men on the way.
[11361][11401]In the fortress,|you will face more than the Slayers.
[11401][11453]You will face the Beast,|who is their leader.
[11453][11487]He can be killed.
[11487][11510]Perhaps.
[11510][11550]But no man has ever|seen him and lived.
[11550][11584]You will need more|than men and swords.
[11584][11642]You will need the power|of the glaive.
[11701][11727]The glaive is nothing|but an ancient symbol.
[11727][11747]It doesn't really exist.
[11747][11786]It exists up there.
[11789][11824]In a cave on the highest peak.
[11824][11847]Without the glaive...
[11847][11876]you will never be able|to reach Lyssa.
[11876][11903]I need weapons, not symbols.
[11903][11941]Once, the glaive|was a very powerful weapon.
[11941][11969]It can be so again...
[11969][12007]but only in the hands|of the right man.
[12007][12042]For only the right man|can retrieve the glaive.
[12042][12064]Am I that man?
[12064][12098]I wish I knew.
[12099][12139]I cannot go with you.
[12139][12170]Don't worry.|If it's there, I'll come back with it.
[12170][12202]If you do not come back with it...
[12202][12250]you'll not come back at all.
[15509][15546]/You have been brought here|/for a marriage.
[15546][15596]/I'm the king you will choose.
[15730][15767]Do not use it|until you need it.
[15767][15810]- Well, how will I know when?|- You will know.
[15810][15842]You lead me to the Black Fortress,|I'll use it soon enough.
[15842][15868]It will not be so easy.
[15868][15896]With each sunrise,|the Black Fortress moves.
[15896][15924]Sometimes it is in mountains,|sometimes in the desert...
[15924][15951]sometimes in the sea.
[15951][15970]Never the same place twice.
[15970][16010]You told me|you knew where to find it.
[16010][16047]There are kingly virtues|other than bravery.
[16047][16091]Courtesy is one of them!
[16097][16127]I'm sorry.
[16151][16187]It's the thought of Lyssa there.
[16187][16211]Yes.
[16236][16285]Well, I, too, was young once.
[16306][16350]I, too, loved as you do.
[16356][16383]But your love will be...
[16383][16421]luckier than mine.
[16423][16458]What I told you is that I knew|how to find the fortress.
[16458][16519]And that is by seeking the vision|of the blind emerald seer.
[16519][16533]His place isn't known either.
[16533][16610]It is known to me.|It is a day's journey from here. Come.
[17009][17034]Help!
[17040][17079]Help! I'm drowning!
[17085][17126]This might have been quicksand!
[17126][17191]I might have been sucked to my death|while you stood there gawking!
[17191][17223]Where is this place?
[17223][17249]A forest near the Granite Mountains.
[17249][17287]Blast! A thousand miles off course.
[17287][17312]Well, I was rushed.
[17312][17349]There was a difference of opinion|concerning a gooseberry pie.
[17349][17391]The man left it|sitting on his windowsill.
[17391][17438]- What did he expect?|- Perhaps he expected to eat it.
[17438][17487]For that rudeness,|I think I'll turn you into a bat.
[17487][17504]Might teach you some manners...
[17504][17518]to hang upside down...
[17518][17544]for an hour or two.
[17544][17572]The hill people|lack the power to do harm.
[17572][17616]We shall see about that, old man.|We'll see about that.
[17616][17656]No. That's a recipe|for hot fudge sauce.
[17656][17686]Oh, well, it'll have to be a goose...
[17686][17719]fat and ugly.
[17770][17810]Very fat, very ugly.
[17873][17896]And from that, you see|what I could have done to you...
[17896][17941]if I were a vengeful man.
[17975][18006]You may leave me now.
[18006][18047]Dear, let me see now.
[18122][18149]The forest is not safe.|You'd best travel with us.
[18149][18203]Me? Travel with you?|Do you know who I am?
[18203][18237]I am Ergo the Magnificent.
[18237][18264]Short in stature, tall in power...
[18264][18293]narrow of purpose|and wide of vision.
[18293][18369]And I do not travel with peasants|and beggars. Good-bye.
[18589][18620]Wait! Wait for me!
[18620][18637]I've just remembered.
[18637][18685]- I've urgent business in this direction.|- What business?
[18685][18719]Staying alive.
[19015][19062]/I will allow you to go|/wherever you please within these walls.
[19062][19103]/For this is the palace|/from which you will rule this world...
[19103][19141]/and countless others.
[19141][19166]/You cannot escape me.
[19166][19208]/You will be my queen.
[19388][19450]You're no great chooser|of roads, old man.
[19484][19546]This way will save us|half a day's travel.
[19710][19730]Robbers.
[19730][19760]They're men. We don't know yet|whether they're robbers.
[19760][19787]Faces that ugly|can only belong to robbers.
[19787][19849]Don't worry.|I'll turn them all into pigs.
[20030][20063]You're surrounded by 1 00 men.
[20063][20105]A hundred's not enough.
[20105][20160]Well, what have we here?|A fighter.
[20166][20187]Besides, you're short about 90 men.
[20187][20211]Let's just kill them|and be done with it, Torquil.
[20211][20232]Shut up, Rhun.
[20232][20254]I don't kill men without good reason.
[20254][20307]Nor do I,|and be thankful for it.
[20348][20379]- You're escaped prisoners.|- Every one.
[20379][20430]Thieves, bandits,|fighters and brawlers.
[20430][20458]- Desperate men.|- Desperate as you'll ever see.
[20458][20474]Good.
[20474][20539]- Those are the kind of men I need.|- You need?
[20539][20574]See, these men|follow no man but me.
[20574][20608]And I follow no man at all.
[20608][20640]- Would you follow a king?|- A king?
[20640][20709]Many lunatics wandering the countryside|claiming to be kings, eh?
[20709][20738]Would you follow a king|to the Black Fortress?
[20738][20758]Now I know you're a lunatic.
[20758][20783]I wouldn't follow me own father|to the Black Fortress.
[20783][20812]- If he could find it.|- Not that he'd be foolish enough.
[20812][20850]Is it foolish to defend your world and|to fight for your homes and families?
[20850][20880]If the invaders conquer,|you'll be slaves with the rest of us.
[20880][20916]Noble sentiments, but we fight|for profit, you know what I mean?
[20916][20944]And the profit's freedom|and fame.
[20944][20974]Freedom? But we have it.
[20974][21007]Fame? It's an empty purse.
[21007][21036]Count it, you're broke.
[21036][21060]Eat it, go hungry.
[21060][21078]Seek it and go mad.
[21078][21096]That is true.
[21096][21176]But this fame and this freedom|you could leave to your sons.
[21228][21259]- How did you know I had sons?|- If the Slayers conquer Krull...
[21259][21314]your sons will be enslaved forever.
[21315][21342]I have no sons,|but I will go with you.
[21342][21367]What?
[21369][21412]The boy shames you all.
[21523][21564]Only the king and the lord marshal|have the keys to these manacles.
[21564][21604]You don't look like a lord marshal.
[21604][21639]Look about the right age|to be Turold's son.
[21639][21668]Exact age.
[21668][21703]Torquil, you're growing old.|Your brain's softening.
[21703][21759]Nine men like you are worth an army.
[21861][21931]If we succeed, unlock them.|Otherwise, I'll die with them.
[21931][21971]Well, you heard him.|We are now an army!
[21971][22004]- An unpaid army.|- You got a problem, Rhun?
[22004][22038]Look, can't a man even talk to himself|without being interrupted?
[22038][22067]- Let's go.|- Saddle up!
[22067][22092]Move!
[22168][22201]Gooseberries!
[22464][22498]In here. Help!
[22735][22773]Horrible! There was|a terrible creature over there!
[22773][22803]And over there,|a creature with only one eye!
[22803][22823]- One eye?|- A cyclops.
[22823][22850]And he was aiming a spear|straight at me.
[22850][22875]Had that been so,|you would now be dead.
[22875][22893]He was aiming at a Slayer...
[22893][22933]for they have ancient hatred|between them.
[22933][22959]Long ago, his ancestors...
[22959][23009]lived in a world far from Krull...
[23009][23061]and had two eyes like other men.
[23064][23083]Then they made a bargain|with the Beast...
[23083][23105]who was the leader of the Slayers.
[23105][23147]They gave up one of their eyes|in exchange for the power...
[23147][23195]to see into the future,|but they were cheated.
[23195][23248]And the only future they are permitted|to see is the time of their own death.
[23248][23282]They're sad, solitary creatures.
[23282][23314]Born to know...
[23314][23331]the day they will die.
[23331][23407]Today would have been my day,|if it hadn't been for him.
[23471][23498]We three will go on.|The rest will remain here.
[23498][23553]We four will go on. I'm not|staying behind with these criminals.
[23553][23589]We four will go.
[23715][23745]He marches us towards|a solid face of rock.
[23745][23794]The man has raisins|in his brain case.
[23794][23840]I recognize an old friend.
[24046][24087]Mad. They're all mad.
[24770][24811]We seek the Black Fortress!
[24811][24847]Such a vision will be opposed.|Who seeks it?
[24847][24869]The new king.
[24869][24890]With an old voice?
[24890][24929]You know the voice?
[24940][24975]Yes, my friend.
[24987][25031]We're trying to find it.
[25081][25134]I will seek the fortress for you.
[25448][25482]Got any sugar bowls?|Gum drops?
[25482][25535]What kind of boy are you?|Boys always have candy.
[25535][25577]I have a cinnamon bar.
[25592][25625]Share and share alike.
[25625][25654]I am Ergo the Magnificent.
[25654][25676]Short in stature, tall in power...
[25676][25700]narrow of purpose|and wide of vision.
[25700][25721]That is very impressive.
[25721][25752]- I should hope so.|- I'm Titch.
[25752][25808]That's not impressive,|but adequate.
[26243][26280]The Black Fortress.
[26280][26306]Where?
[26463][26483]Are you all right?
[26483][26507]Yes.
[26510][26554]The Beast does not like|curious seers poking into his affairs.
[26554][26586]His power is too great|for you to overcome?
[26586][26610]Yes, here.
[26610][26643]But there's one place|where his power cannot reach.
[26643][26675]- The Emerald Temple.|- Yes, in that place...
[26675][26695]he cannot oppose my vision.
[26695][26716]Will you travel there with us?
[26716][26761]It is in the great swamp...|a treacherous place.
[26761][26797]Our need is great.
[27087][27117]The temple is at the center|of the swamp...
[27117][27150]where three trees grow as one.
[27150][27177]How could anything grow in that place?|It smells of death.
[27177][27208]Death and power are close cousins.
[27208][27271]Don't think I like|your relatives, old man.
[27397][27448]Have a look.|The profit of this journey.
[27448][27491]They're worth a fortune.
[27491][27517]Maybe, to someone|who's very nearsighted.
[27517][27542]What?
[27558][27573]But they were emeralds.
[27573][27597]Hey, Rhun. Emeralds.
[27597][27648]I swear it!|They were emeralds.
[27655][27688]Rocks in our pockets|and gravestones above our heads...
[27688][27744]is what we'll get from this journey.
[28019][28040]Slayers!
[28040][28090]- From the lake!|- Take cover!
[28122][28185]- Get over there!|- There's more over here!
[28188][28226]- Get down!|- They're over here!
[28226][28264]Quick! Over there!
[28999][29052]Over here!|There's one over here!
[29111][29142]That's the second time|you've saved my life.
[29142][29193]- I am Ergo.|- The Magnificent.
[29224][29259]- Hasn't he got a name?|- His name is Rell.
[29259][29295]He visits the seer sometimes.|He doesn't speak much.
[29295][29334]So I've noticed, except to be sarcastic|to people who wish to be friends.
[29334][29378]Or jest with those|who already are his friends.
[29378][29398]My name is no jest, beanpole.
[29398][29430]It's all very well to have a short name|when you're 20 feet tall.
[29430][29457]But small people need large names|to give them weight.
[29457][29493]Your actions give you weight,|my friend.
[29493][29518]I saw you save the boy|from a spear.
[29518][29550]Well, that's what friends|are supposed to do for each other.
[29550][29580]- Quite so.|- You've been with us for a long way now.
[29580][29602]Since the beginning.
[29602][29627]When I learned that the old one|had come down...
[29627][29659]I knew the time had come.
[29659][29691]Join us, then.|All men need company.
[29691][29724]Yes. All men.
[29839][29868]That way.
[29874][29914]If I had my wish,|I'd be out of this place right away.
[29914][29934]If I really had my wish...
[29934][29961]I'd be sitting|on top of a gooseberry pie...
[29961][29981]as big as a mountain.
[29981][30014]No. That's a bit greedy.|I'll settle for one as big as a house.
[30014][30051]- I'd wish for a puppy.|- Only one puppy?
[30051][30074]If you're wishing,|why not wish for a hundred?
[30074][30101]- I only want one.|- Oh, that's a foolish wish.
[30101][30126]And you, Rell?|What would you wish for?
[30126][30156]Ignorance.
[30793][30817]- Nennog, help him!|- Help!
[30817][30833]The ground. It's sinking!
[30833][30859]It is the power of the Beast.
[30859][30879]Link up! Make a chain!
[30879][30937]- Get me out!|- Rhun, get hold of him!
[31020][31058]- Hang on!|- Pull!
[31063][31099]Give me the axe!
[31106][31142]- Here!|- Quick!
[31144][31169]Pull!
[31188][31227]- Pull!|- Pull him!
[31263][31294]I'm slipping!
[31294][31323]- Pull it!|- Hold on!
[31323][31364]- That's it!|- Heave!
[31389][31416]Nennog!
[31446][31474]Help me!
[31549][31589]Get me out! Help me!
[31695][31742]Nennog, keep still.|Don't struggle.
[31742][31761]- Reach.|- Hold on!
[31761][31801]- Reach!|- Keep still, Nennog!
[31801][31836]- Don't struggle!|- Stretch!
[31836][31871]- Pull!|- Pull!
[32368][32407]Is that you, Titch?
[32570][32629]- How far to the temple?|- Not far now.
[32633][32652]- Make sure we're not being followed.|- Right.
[32652][32700]- I will stay.|- Be careful.
[32769][32799]Thank you.
[32806][32836]I'll lead the seer.|Titch, you go ahead.
[32836][32875]Thank you, brother.
[32962][33026]I'll lead the seer.|You go ahead with Titch.
[33206][33246]- This way?|- No, here.
[33246][33275]You sure?
[33286][33328]I recognize this tree.
[33348][33402]I think I recognize the place now.
[33715][33734]We're in sight of the trees, brother.
[33734][33774]Ye who seeks the knowledge|must lead me.
[33774][33819]No one else may approach.
[34217][34268]Here is the knowledge you seek.
[34604][34653]The beast has many weapons.|This was one of them.
[34653][34688]The changeling.
[34718][34733]How did you know?
[34733][34794]I found the seer's body|in the quicksand.
[34804][34828]He gave his life for us.
[34828][34865]He was my only family.
[34865][34907]We're your family now.
[35031][35064]Now we have no way|to find the Black Fortress.
[35064][35104]There is one who might help.
[35104][35143]- Who?|- The Widow of the Web.
[35143][35179]That creature helps no one.|And none who go there return.
[35179][35215]- She has great powers.|- Yeah, to kill.
[35215][35275]She may not kill me,|for I know her name.
[35275][35300]Her name is Death.
[35300][35376]She had another name once,|an ancient and powerful name.
[35426][35518]We all risk our lives on this journey.|My risk is no greater than yours.
[35530][35561]I must try.
[35873][35899]Where are my papers?
[35899][35972]Blast! I really must|get organized one of these days.
[36114][36151]Puppy, come here.
[36253][36293]- Where's Ergo?|- He's...
[36293][36332]He'll be back soon.
[36870][36897]From here, I go on alone.
[36897][36936]- I'm going with you.|- No.
[36936][36976]If two approach,|she would certainly kill both.
[36976][36996]Alone, I may have a chance.
[36996][37050]- Each to his fate, Colwyn.|- Yes.
[37053][37095]Yes, each to his fate.
[37176][37220]If I'm not back by morning...
[37220][37257]you'll know mine.
[37269][37302]We stay here.
[37473][37527]I still say|it was a foolish wish.
[37553][37574]We have no food...
[37574][37628]and the men|are too tired to hunt.
[37634][37648]- Hey, Kegan.|- Hello.
[37648][37693]Doesn't one of your wives|live in a village near here?
[37693][37738]Lona. No, she moved|down to the river.
[37738][37790]- How many wives does he have?|- Seven or eight at the last count.
[37790][37838]- Well, he's a traveling man, you see.|- He covers a lot of ground.
[37838][37865]Merith.
[37878][37907]Yeah, she lives in the village|at the edge of the giant trees.
[37907][37947]- Can she cook?|- It's not her strongest point.
[37947][37996]Just have her bring provisions, eh?|Magnificence there reckons he can cook.
[37996][38045]- We'll soon see.|- Oh, yeah?
[38319][38344]There you are.|You all look so hungry.
[38344][38400]Get out of my way.|Let me get at it.
[38515][38540]- Well?|- Well, what?
[38540][38562]Who's the girl?
[38562][38599]Her village was burned.|She had nowhere to go, so I took her in.
[38599][38624]Look at her one more time,|and I'll throw her out.
[38624][38652]Merith, oh, my sweet.
[38652][38680]She doesn't hold a candle to you.
[38680][38703]- She's not even pretty.|- Yeah?
[38703][38768]Now, look, petal,|faithful is my middle name.
[38788][38817]You must eat something.
[38817][38837]I'm not hungry.
[38837][38872]Please. For me.
[38897][38927]Thank you.
[39589][39614]What troubles you?
[39614][39660]You have chosen a paltry kingdom|on an insignificant planet.
[39660][39691]- And love.|- Love is fleeting.
[39691][39728]Power is eternal.
[39838][39881]Such is my power.|It can be yours.
[39881][39920]I don't want your power.
[39920][39950]Do not let my form frighten you.
[39950][39976]Lyssa.
[39992][40027]I can assume any form I wish.
[40027][40060]Any form you wish.
[40060][40109]There's no love in that form.
[40132][40196]And you think there's love|in your boy king?
[40200][40231]I've not held a man in my arms|since my lover left.
[40231][40246]This is a lie!
[40246][40269]I know how painful it is|to be far from the one you love.
[40269][40303]- He will betray you.|- Comfort me for one night.
[40303][40330]- He will not.|- I can't betray my bride.
[40330][40345]Then he will die.
[40345][40369]Let me comfort you.
[40369][40416]I can't accept comfort|when she has none.
[40416][40469]- You will not, then?|- I cannot.
[40490][40544]My master said, '' Make him betray her.|If not, kill him. ''
[40544][40571]Yes, he is my master.
[40571][40604]These talons were|a heartbeat away from your throat.
[40604][40631]I could've killed you in an instant.
[40631][40676]But in the hour I knew you,|I loved you.
[40676][40710]'Tis you who are betrayed.|Power is fleeting.
[40710][40740]- Love is life for you, death for me.|- Love is eternal.
[40740][40772]Remember me.
[40794][40812]- This way!|- What is it?
[40812][40838]Consider this power.
[40838][40869]If you consent to be my queen...
[40869][40898]I will halt the attacks|of the Slayers.
[40898][40942]It is in your power|to stop the killing and burning.
[40942][40994]Each hour you delay,|more innocent people will be killed.
[40994][41024]Think on it.
[41024][41058]Hurry, Colwyn.
[41392][41429]I seek the Widow!
[41447][41486]Enter here and die.
[42482][42508]Lyssa!
[42559][42576]Who speaks that name?
[42576][42610]It is I, Ynyr!
[42620][42661]I give you this time.
[44112][44146]I was young|when I last heard that name.
[44146][44188]I was young|when I last spoke it to you.
[44188][44215]And my face...
[44215][44237]was as beautiful as my name.
[44237][44295]And I loved you, Lyssa,|with all my heart.
[44295][44325]But you would not stay with me.
[44325][44344]There were responsibilities, duty.
[44344][44373]Ambition.
[44397][44431]You had a son.
[44451][44481]We had a son.
[44481][44522]But you said nothing.
[44527][44549]Where is he?
[44549][44591]I killed him when he was born.
[44591][44634]And this is my punishment.
[44634][44670]- My son?|- Yes.
[44673][44745]Since I could not kill you,|my rage needed a victim.
[44794][44833]I know you can never forgive me.
[44833][44877]I cannot forgive myself.|I have already forgiven you.
[44877][44934]You can never forgive a woman|who has killed your son.
[44934][44964]If I had not...
[44964][45020]could I see you now|as I saw you then?
[45020][45078]And allow me to see|through your eyes.
[45232][45261]How could I have left you?
[45261][45312]Your vision is your gift to me.
[45330][45364]And your vision could be|your gift to me.
[45364][45438]- What can I see for you?|- Where does the Black Fortress rise?
[45438][45458]Tomorrow...
[45458][45490]in the Iron Desert.
[45490][45513]But the knowledge is useless to you,|for you cannot leave here.
[45513][45540]No man has ever escaped the Web.
[45540][45565]There's a young girl|being held in the Fortress.
[45565][45589]A young girl with your name.
[45589][45627]A young man seeks her.|A young man.
[45627][45680]The age I was when you and I met.
[45702][45743]When you and I loved.
[45754][45806]What you ask is beyond my power.
[45828][45861]It can be turned only once.
[45861][45895]That is the law of the Web.
[45895][45921]Then the second Lyssa|will share your fate.
[45921][45954]She will die,|grow old and lonely.
[45954][45979]She will die|in a place of darkness.
[45979][46044]This whole world|will be a place of darkness.
[46074][46125]These are the sands of my life.
[46134][46191]Accept them, and the spider|will have no power to harm you.
[46191][46233]But your own life|runs out with the sand.
[46233][46266]What about your life?
[46266][46326]I give it to the girl|who bears my name.
[46358][46395]I cannot stop the sand.
[46395][46436]You cannot stop time.
[46460][46487]Go now.
[46494][46535]Save the other Lyssa.
[47687][47718]At sunrise!
[47764][47792]At sunrise...
[47792][47824]the Black Fortress will appear...
[47824][47844]in the Iron Desert.
[47844][47888]It will remain there|until sunrise of the following day.
[47888][47919]You must...
[47992][48015]You...
[48015][48046]You must reach it.
[48046][48106]We will reach it,|and you'll be with us.
[48126][48155]No, my...
[48173][48208]My race is run.
[48230][48270]Use your power wisely.
[48270][48309]Do not squander it.
[48311][48330]I learned the power from you.
[48330][48365]I won't forget.
[48527][48567]We'll bury him here.
[48590][48620]The Iron Desert's|a thousand leagues from here.
[48620][48685]Fire mares. Fire mares can travel|a thousand leagues in a day.
[48685][48738]There's time,|if we move quickly.
[49881][49928]That's it.|Drive them back.
[49932][49974]The gray's the leader!
[50246][50274]Hold it.
[50381][50418]Come on! Come on!
[50429][50449]Hold it up!
[50449][50488]That's it. Come on!
[50624][50642]Gentle as a baby.
[50642][50672]Torquil, saddle the others, quickly.
[50672][50698]Right.
[50754][50782]Come on, stand still.
[50782][50850]Come on! Still! Hold it!|Stand still, you beast!
[50939][50970]Take good care of him.
[50970][50999]- Why doesn't he come?|- It's his time to die.
[50999][51033]If he's going to die anyway,|why doesn't he come with us?
[51033][51064]No, he must die here|and accept his fate.
[51064][51129]If he opposes it,|he'll bring great pain on himself.
[51129][51148]Whoa. Steady.
[51148][51203]- I must remain here.|- Is it time?
[51213][51261]You've done enough, Rell.|Stay here.
[51261][51298]Each to his fate.
[51299][51319]Each to his fate.
[51319][51342]Rell, I'll ride with you.
[51342][51393]I have to stay here, my friend.
[51397][51432]We had no time.
[51433][51464]Let's go. Saddle up!
[51464][51499]Come on! Go on!
[51839][51867]Hold on!
[53089][53103]There it is!
[53103][53140]Yeah. And only madmen|would want to get this close to it.
[53140][53162]We're gonna get a lot closer.
[53162][53185]And quickly.|It's almost dawn.
[53185][53250]We must get inside|before the twin suns rise.
[54310][54339]Get back!
[54457][54479]I was wrong.
[54479][54507]The journey was worthwhile.
[54507][54544]Finish it for me.
[54699][54728]- We'll have to rush them.|- No, wait!
[54728][54787]We'll be picked off|as soon as we move.
[54811][54844]Colwyn, look.
[55150][55181]Follow him!
[55605][55633]Come on!
[55679][55717]Hey, mind the boy!
[55756][55821]- Get your axe in the opening!|- It's no use.
[55838][55871]My time's up.
[56484][56516]Keep moving.
[56734][56764]Which way?
[56767][56796]Look out!
[56889][56920]- My traveling days are over, my friend.|- No, we'll get you out of here.
[56920][56964]No, here's where I stay.
[57124][57152]Lead on.
[57399][57436]I can't hold him!
[57457][57493]Throw us a rope!
[57556][57568]Slayers!
[57568][57603]I'm going down.
[57621][57644]Go!
[57653][57677]Get back! Come on!
[57677][57745]- No, wait!|- There's nothing we can do! Get up!
[58245][58275]From here, I must go on alone.
[58275][58323]Go where? There's no way in.
[58325][58362]There is one way.
[58856][58906]We must find the others, Ergo.
[59540][59576]They've stopped.
[59621][59651]Let it go!
[59669][59698]Look out!
[60232][60261]Not here, Colwyn.|He's too powerful.
[60261][60321]You must fight him|away from the center.
[62755][62822]The glaive is gone.|I have no way to fight him.
[62833][62887]Colwyn, it's not the glaive.|It's you.
[62887][62922]Lyssa, it's us.|It's us he can't defeat.
[62922][62963]It will not return to me except at the|hand of the woman I choose as my wife.
[62963][63014]I give it only to the man|whom I choose as my husband.
[63014][63061]Take the fire from my hand.
[63970][64026]We have to find the others.|Come on.
[64201][64245]I won't leave you, Ergo.
[64360][64396]Look! Over here!
[64425][64484]- That's Ergo!|- He may still be alive!
[64506][64535]- Let's get out of here.|- He risked his life to save us.
[64535][64621]We can't leave him here if there's|even a chance he's still alive.
[64833][64888]We'll get you out of here.|Come on.
[65653][65684]Stand back.
[65979][66020]Oswyn, help him down.
[67030][67057]He'll be all right.
[67057][67083]- You are his queen?|- Yes.
[67083][67105]- Then we won?|- Yes.
[67105][67163]Oh, boy,|I should've stuck to puppies.
[67169][67240]I think it's time|you unlocked those manacles, huh?
[67249][67276]Well...
[67288][67320]I thought I'd keep them|as a memento of our journey.
[67320][67352]Well, the key is yours.
[67352][67385]Only the king and his lord marshal|carry this key.
[67385][67418]That's right.
[67474][67519]/A girl of ancient name|/shall become queen.
[67519][67538]/She shall choose a king...
[67538][67569]/and together|/they shall rule our world...

Clarence, they're here.
(Clarence) I'll be there in a minute.
- Clarence!
- I hear ya!
- Clarence, they're waiting!
- I'm coming. I'm coming.
Clarence, could it be him?
No. It was probably just those punks that broke in Tibbits' house last Halloween.
What do you want?
(Demonic voice) I want the skull.
I don't know where it is.
It's not here.
Give me the skull.
Wow.
I don't believe it.
- Wow! It's big, isn't it?
- Yep.
It's definitely not built to code.
(Woman) How many generations of your family lived here?
(Man) I don't know.
Who decorated this place?
Wow.
Looks like something's missing.
Great... I thought the electricity was supposed to be on, Jesse.
Yeah, it is.
The switch must be out.
Is there a phone in here?
Great.
(Kate) John Statman, please.
- 'Hello.'
- John, hi. It's Kate.
- 'Hey.'
- Sorry I couldn't call you earlier.
- The car phone doesn't work out here.
- What's the house like?
Well, it's a pit, but Jesse's completely in love with it.
(Kate, laughing) How did the meeting go?
Is he interested?
No?
Great! We could have had him recording in the studio by early next month.
- 'What should we do?
- We've got to find somebody fast.
Did you go see that new band down at the Miner's Club?
Raw indie, don't you think?
You're absolutely right.
Hey did you get that letter from...?
(Jessie) I don't believe it.
That's my morn and dad.
Hey, I was pretty cute.
That was my grandfather.
So he must have been my great-great-grandfather,
Jesse McLaughlin.
They named me after him.
What on earth were you doing?
I couldn't sleep, so I went downstairs to just look around.
What is that?
But I don't do it.
Oh, my God.

Hmm.
They're different.
This one's got jewels in its eyes.
- They're not the same skull.
- Hey, Jess, what you doing there, huh?
- Come on Charlie, give it. It's private.
- Hey, this is cool.
- Looks like it's old. What is it?
- Come on Charlie, give it.
- Not until you tell me what it is.
- It's nothing.
- Promise you won't laugh?
- Yeah.
- You'll never believe me, anyway.
- Sure, I will. OK, here take it.
Fine. See this guy?
It's my great-great-grandfather.
He has the same name as me.
He was an outlaw in the old west.
- OK, I can buy that.
- Yeah, look at this skull he's holding.
It's made completely out of raw crystal.
And this guy in the background, this is Jesse's partner Slim Reeser.
Now, he and Jesse had a falling out over the skull and became bitter enemies.
Slim died without ever getting the skull from Jesse.
Now, look at this. See this skull?
And now it's different from the one here in the book, right?
I mean this one has got jewels in the eyes.
- Wait, wait a minute.
- But, listen to this. OK.
Um, all right.
Legend has it, that there was a second skull that had untold powers that could unlock the mysteries of the universe and bring eternal life to those who possessed it.
So, question is if this is the legendary second skull, where is it?
Uh, why you asking me?
I mean, how am I supposed to know?
Charlie, Charlie, um... there's an old cemetery up on the hill.
Jesse was buried there in 1916.
But look here. It says, that when the
Aztecs buried their dead they wrapped the bodies in several layers of cloth and they surrounded them with their weapons and jewels.
It was worth millions? Was it a lot?
I say, let's go for it.
There's nothing down here.
Let's quit.
I don't care if all the money in the world is down here.
I just want some sleep.
I'm really tired.
- (Whispers) Charlie.
- Huh?
- We got it.
- Oh, no.
No.
- You got it, Charlie?
- Yeah.
I give up. I can't feel anything.
Please, let me die.
Please, let me die.
(Gasping) Charlie.
Jess, what?
Come on.
I don't have time for this, Jess.
What's in there?
Charlie!
(Straining) Help me, you idiot.
Oh, oh, oh, Jesse!
It's me.
- I'm your great-great-grandson.
- Huh?
They named me after you.
My name is Jesse, too.
Huh?
My-great-great-grandson?
- What year is it?
- I don't know.
Now, don't you mess with me, boy.
Uh, 1986.
It's October 30th, 1986.
(Laughing) We"!
Goddamn.
You know I've been waiting over 70 years for some jackass to get the sense to come dig me up.
Thank you, boy.
Well.
There she is.
There is something special about this old house.
Can't you feel it? I can.
Come on.
Let's go this way.
(Jesse) Where you going?
(Jesse Sm) There.
Remember boys, this house is a temple, as fantastic as any pyramid or castle you'll ever see.
It don't know time or space or any of that hogwash, but the forces of evil are always after this skull and you've got to help me to protect it.
So don't let no one touch the dang thing, ya hear?
Here.
You can sleep on this.
Is this the way you treat family?
Making him hide down in the basement like some slimy old lizard?
Well, I'm sorry.
I must be out of practice.
- I don't have any family, sir.
- Don't call me sir.
I ain't no politician.
Heck, I'm your great-great-grandfather.
You can call me Gramps.
That's what your granddaddy used to call me.
All right. Gramps.
Well.
- Uh, we better hit the hay.
- But I'm not tired.
I don't need no sleep.
Well, let's get me cleaned up and then we go out on the town and do a little high steppin'.
- I don't know if that's such a good idea.
- Why not?
- There's nothing wrong with me.
- No. There's nothing wrong with you.
Yeah, well something is bothering you.
I can see it in your eyes.
Look, I'm just as fit as a fiddle. I'm...
(Crying) Oh, no.
Oh, no.
I'm supposed to be young again.
Gramps, maybe you should...
(Crying) Look at me.
I'm a 170-year-old fart.
A goddamn zombie.
Well, you look really good for a
170-year-old zombie, Gramps, really great.
I ain't gonna die, if it's the last thing I do.

- Will you look at them stars?
- Whew!
You know, they were clearer back in the old days.
(Laughing) Sometimes they were so bright, you couldn't get to sleep.
Well you know, Gramps, it's the ozone.
I mean.
I mean, you know, insect repellents you know, under arm deodorants, maybe just a pinch of communism is making the stars fade away.
You're drunk!
Whoa!
I'd better drive.
Charlie?
Jesse, you old golf bag, how are you?
John, what are you doing here?
Oh, well, your beautiful lady informed me that she's found the Madonna of the '80s.

- Have a brewski, Gramps.
- Thanks.
I hate this doggone box
Got all them channels and got nothing interesting to watch.
(On TV) 'There I was, in the middle of Kansas facing 500 crazy fanatics
'and me with only 15 soldiers...'
Now you take this Ronald Reagan fellow, he sure is a pansy.
He wouldn't have lasted ten minutes back in the old days.
'..There comes a time in every soldier's life when he must stand or fall alone.'
(Gramps) It wouldn't do no good to tell you how it was. You had to be there.
All them movies and books and crap, they don't tell you how it really was - it was rough.
I got a question for you.
Whatever happened to Slim Reeser?
Slim Reeser ain't part of my vocabulary no more, son.
We had a disagreement about who the skull belonged to.
- What did you do?
- I shot the scallywag is what I did.
Well, he took a shot at me first, so I had to teach him a lesson.
And I left him to die in the Mojave Desert.
And that was that?
Yeah, well that was that.
Gramps, did you ever rob a stagecoach?
- (Laughing) Sure.
- All right!
All the time.
I robbed a stagecoach once just outside of Dodge City.
Now, every day at about 5:30, it used t0 come into the bank with a bag of money that would give an elephant a hernia.
We set up on both sides of a little gorge just outside of town and when the stagecoach come on through...
...and they chased me around them hills and clean across the border into Arizona territory, but I was riding for about two weeks without ever getting out of the saddle, trying to lose them fellows.
...holding them off with just two pistols and a Winchester.
All of the sudden I take an arrow right through the leg, right there and another one in the shoulder, right there...
...the cage was never uncovered again and there must've a billion dollars in diamonds and jewels down there.
Now that's something
I intend to search for, just as soon as I get rejuvenated.
U' POD music)
- Shh.
- What?
I hear something.
Yeah, it sounds like music.
- What time is it?
- Bring back some more beer.

- Cool!
I invited some people over for Halloween.
I forgot!
Sorry.

Hey Smith, how you doing?
Get over here.
Guess who!
- Rochelle!
- Long time, no see.
It's been so long since I've seen you.
Yeah, it sure has.
Excuse me, we need to talk outside.
- How long you out here for?
- Like a week.
- Would you hold this trash for a minute?
- Sure.
You look great.
Now, I know some people down in Hollywood...
- (Jesse) Charlie. Charlie.
- What?
Look. Gramps. What is he doing?
- He looks like he's about to score.
- Yeah, but how did he get up here?
Will you relax?
It's Halloween. He blends right in.
All right, Gramps! Go for it, pal.
Hey, excuse me. Hey Susan!
- Isn't he great?
- Yeah, he's an old friend, from way back.
Hey! Excuse me!
Hey!
- Hey, watch it.
- (Angry growling)
- Jesse?
- Uh-huh.
Um, can I talk to you?
- Out in back?
- Sure.
- I'll meet you there.
- Okey-dokey.
Hey.
You better pack your ass in a suitcase and head for Panama.
You jerk!
I knew it was her all along! Stupid fool!
Take it easy! No, wait. Please.
No! Charlie, stop him.
Hold it!
Charlie, there's a jungle in there.
- Can I get you something? Water?
- Valium, get me Valium.
Whiskey, get me whiskey.
I need the skull.
Without it I'm a goner for sure.
Don't let him get away.
- Gramps, there's a jungle upstairs.
- He took it in there.
He's from the Stone Age, kid.
You've got to stop him.
Don't worry, he's a pushover.
Gramps, I don't think you understand.
There is a jungle...
Jesse, in the wrong hands that skull could cause trouble.
NOW, go!
(Whispers) Charlie.
Charlie.
Ha!
Charlie, don't sneak up behind me like that.
Well, I just happen to have this in the trunk of the car.
You never know when you're going to need one in a pinch, huh?
What is it?
This is an Uzi, semi-automatic firing weapon.
- Charlie, this is a machine gun.
- So?
So.
So, what about me?
What do I get?
Only had the one Uzi, you know, but uh... I got one of these.
- What do I do with this, light cigars?
- No, you shoot people with it.
Duh.
OK.
On the count of three, you're going to kick the door open, run in there blindly and I'll cover you, OK?
The guy with the big gun goes first.
OK.
- (Sighs) Ready?
- Yeah.
(Both) One, two...
Hold on.
(Both) One, two, three.
- Ow! What are you doing?
- Making sure you're not dreaming.
Charlie.
Nobody's home. What do we do?
We need a plan.
Yeah, let's get the skull and get the hell out of here.
Good plan.
Thanks, Charlie.
Gently, please!
Take your best shot.
Huh?
You coward!
Come back and fight like a man!
- Where did he go?
- He ran away.
Tail between his legs!
Chicken shit barbarian.
- Charlie, we got it.
- All right!
The skull is ours!
Woo-hoo! Yes!
No! Oh no.
- Come back. Wait!
- Hey Jesse, don't lose it!
This one.
Go on, hurry up.
- Jesse.
- Yeah.
Don't worry.
If you fall you'll die real fast.
Thanks, Charlie(!)
A-choo!
You're doing great, Jesse!
Keep going! Ow!
(Laughing) What an idiot.
0w!
(Charlie) Hey, Jesse, looking good.
Wish I had a camera!
OK.
Nice bird.
Nice birdie.
Jeez!
All right.
Come on, Jesse.
Jesse, a bird there! Look!
Jesse, get out of there, come on.
Come on, Jesse.
Jesse, are you coming?
Come on! Get down!
Come on!
(Jesse yelling) Catch me!
Catch me!
Charlie, catch me!
I got it. I got ya, Jesse.
What the hell was that?
It sounded like a bomb.
Why didn't you use the stairs?
Charlie.
Charlie, you all right?
Agh!
Get him off me! He's eating my leg!
Get him off me.
Jesse!
He's eating me alive.
- Charlie.
- (Charlie crying)
- Charlie!
- He's...
Hey.
Hey Jess, can we keep him?
Well, who's going to take care of him, Charlie?
I'll feed him, change his water and stuff.
Charlie, help me.
Charlie, help me.
And don't forget the beer.
Come on.
Come on.
Get him.
Hey, uh, Jesse?
Damn!
Charlie, hi.
(Nervous laugh) Hi, John. Lana.
(Jesse) Easy.
Come on.
Come on, give it back.
It's nothing to worry about.
- We heard a noise.
- Noise?
Oh, oh, the really loud crashing noise.
Yeah.
Pretty much that one, yeah.
Gotcha!
- (Jesse) Give it back! It's my skull!
- The noise in the kitchen?
Yeah. Look, we just want to know everything's OK.
- Couldn't be better.
- Oh, really?
(Strains) Nice... Nice bird.
Listen, I wanted to tell you before the evening got away, you are a funny, funny guy and I mean that.
That is the hardest commodity to find in our business, really.
Look at this shirt. Is this him?
They're bananas, bananas.
Stay.
- Where is the beer?
- What are you doing out here'?
Somebody's coming!
Do they go all the way around the back?
They do!
- Uh-huh.
- Hi, John.
- Buddy, what's cooking in the kitchen?
- Nothing.
No? And what might be in that closet there?
- Nothing.
- Nothing? Well, can I see?
John, I just told you there's nothing in the closet.
Well, let me see nothing in the closet.
It, uh, wouldn't happen to be your old friend Rochelle in there, would it?
John, what is it you're accusing me of in my own house?
I'm not accusing you of anything.
I'm just asking a question, but I do think
Kate would like an explanation.
You want an explanation?
All right, I'll give you an explanation.
Kate, Kate, get in here!
Kate, I need to talk to you.
- Why are you yelling?
- I'm not yelling.
Now Kate, you know that since we got here there's been some strange things going on in this house.
Charlie! They want an explanation and I'm going to give them one.
Now, listen.
All right now, Charlie and I, last night, went to the cemetery and we dug up my great-great-grandfather's grave.
We were looking for a crystal skull.
It's supposed to be magic.
Anyway, we dug it up and we got the skull, but we also found my great-great-grandfather.
He was dead, but he's alive.
I mean he's a mummy and we brought him back and he's been staying in the basement.
And Charlie and I have just been running through this jungle trying to get the skull back.
And that's who's in there, for your information, Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
Hi, Rochelle.
What are you doing in here?
There's been a mistake.
- Apparently.
- You don't understand.
- I understand perfectly.
- No, Kate, listen to me.
I have no idea what she was doing in there.
- Well, who did you think was in there?
- A mummy!
Or maybe even a baby pterodactyl.
Shame on you, Jesse.
Look! It's a prehistoric bird.
Kate!
Here, let me get those from you.
(Charlie) Good riddance.
She's out of here.
Now we can do whatever we want.
Run around in our underwear, phony phone calls, all kinds of crazy...
Shut up, Charlie.
Can't you shut your mouth just once?
- Surprise!
- Gramps, where's Rochelle?
Watch this.
Jesse.
I waited so long for you.
Rochelle, it's great to see you, but
I'm having some family problems right now.
You understand?
Hey Charlie, can you call Rochelle a cab?
- Hey, Chucky.
- Hey, don't call me Chucky, OK?
It's very sweet of you to come.
Thanks.
Hey there, birdie.
How about a little trade, huh? OK?
Come on. Come to Daddy.
- I think he wants some more.
- I don't have any more steak.
Now, I know that smells good.
Daddy's going to have it ready right away. Right away.
That's a puPPY, YUP, YUP, WP-
I know. I know. Daddy knows.
Now, open your mouth.
Yep, yep. Yep-
Gramps.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
You got me a little upset.
I was just hankering to play a joke on somebody and...
I'm sorry that it turned out to be you.
That's enough, Bippy-
Bippy, that's enough.
Now look, you go on out and play.
That's it. There you go.
Urn, Gramps, look, I got to get to bed.
Do you want me to put the skull back on the fireplace?
I'll take care of that.
Ah.
Bippy-
You little rascal.
You scared the bejesus out of me.
Gramps.
Jesse, Jesse boy.
- Are you all right?
- They bushwhacked me.
It must've been 30, 40 of them.
They come at me from all directions.
Charlie, get up. Charlie, come on.
Charlie.
Charlie, wake up.
Get up!
Charlie, come on.
Come on.
Oh Jesus, Charlie come on.
Charlie.
Charlie, get up.
This better be real important.
- Gramps lost the skull.
- What?
Somebody, I don't know who, stole it.
He's dying, Charlie.
We've got to get it back.
After all we did for him, he loses it?
I can't believe he did that, Jess.
I mean I never met anyone so irresponsible.
- You know I risked my life for that...
- Charlie!
- Yeah?
- Uh, uh, Bill.
- Bill Tanner, electrician.
- Uh, Jesse McLaughlin.
Nice to meet you, Jesse. A young lady called. Said you needed some work done.
- She did, huh?
- The fuse box down in the basement?
Uh, listen Bill, I'm sorry to trouble you, but this really isn't the right time.
That's all right Jesse,
I'm not going to get in your way.
You just show me what needs fixing.
This is quite a room you got here.
Yeah, very, very nice.
- That's a weird fireplace, though.
- Uh, Bill.
- Bill.
- So, what we got in here?
Ah, there it is.
Three mount 240.
These old houses are loaded with them.
So this the room you having problems with, Jesse?
Yeah, all along this wall, but the rest of the house is fine.
I wouldn't worry about that, Jesse.
It didn't look too valuable.
Yep, yep, yep, just as I expected.
Jesse, you got a problem here, but hey, like with any problem you don't want to let it get the best of you.
You know, I've been working on these houses for about 20 years now.
I've seen enough tragedy and disaster to make you want to upchuck in your shorts.
You see, these old houses they uh, they just got minds of their own.
You know and ya just got to teach him who's boss.
You know, just sort of give 'em a spanking.
Huh. Must be foreign-made.
Well, I'm going to fix this old house up for you Jesse, just like it's brand spanking new.
- What is that?
- Shh.
(Bill) Uh-huh.
Oh.
Ooh.
Ah.
- What do you hear?
- Ah, Jesse, Jesse, it's not good.
I've seen this before and it's always made my adenoids curdle.
Hey, don't monkey with those switches,
It's going to blow us both to Milwaukee.
It's touch and go from here, pal.
Could go either way, Jesse.
Oh, hey, hey, Jesse. Want to step into my office here, for a second?
Listen buddy,
I like to be alone with my work, so if you don't mind...?
- Sure.
- You got something to do?
- Sure.
- Go do it. buddy.
Go do it.
(Chuckles) Nice kid.
Oops.
Weird!
See anything?
Forget it.
I'm not going up there.
Gramps can get his own damn skull.
Come on, Charlie. Gramps said they went in here, so don't wimp out on me now.
Hey, buddy.
- Oh, scared you, huh? Relax.
- Oh God, Bill, are you all right?
- Yeah, fine, fine.
- Who is this?
- Uh, Bill.
- Bill Tanner, electrician.
Charlie Couriel, entrepreneur.
Fellas, we got a little problem in the other room. You better come have a look.
Look Bill, I'm sorry, but this really isn't a good time.
Why don't you pack it up and come back tomorrow.
I think we better go in the other room and have a look.
Yep.
There it is.
Looks like you've got some kind of alternate universe in there or something.
Thanks.
Come on, Charlie.
Guess I'm next. Hey Jesse, are there any spiders in there? You know...
You coming, Charlie?
(Bill) I don't know, it's an alternate dimension in there or something and uh...
(Jesse) Incredible.
Well, hold on a second, will ya?
Uh, I've been through this kind of thing before.
Don't touch anything until I get there.
Looks like you're going to need the help of a professional.
- You got a flashlight?
- Yeah.
(Jesse) You know something?
I'm incredibly scared right now.
- (Charlie) Don't be a fag, OK?
- Shh! Listen.
I think it's coming from over there.
- (Jesse) There it is.
- (Bill) Yep.
Well, it's not going to be easy.
They're not going to sacrifice her, are they?
Hey Jesse, now, is she a virgin?
Because I've never seen one before.
She's really dynamite!
Hey!
_ No!
No!
On, boy.
Hey, come on.
Well, I'm sorry we thought she was somebody that we knew.
Go ahead and enjoy. It's OK.
Watch this.
Wa-hoo!
Neat, huh?
Thank you.
Come on. Come on.
Get her out of here.
Jesse!
Aagh!
Come on. Get out of here.
I'll hold them off.
- Bill, I don't remember which way.
- Follow the string.
Come on.
- Bill, come on.
- Don't worry about me.
I got to get home.
It's my kid's little league night.
Where's Bill? I don't see him.
Hey Bill, all right.
Ah, Charlie, good to see you back.
I started to get a little concerned here.
- Hey, hey Bill, what are you doing here?
- You guys throw one heck of a party.
I'd really like to thank you for inviting me along uh, Jess.
It's been a pleasure and Miss...
(Speaking slowly) It was a pleasure to meet you.
Oh and Jess, listen, if you need any more work done just give me a call there, huh?
- Take care, Charlie.
- See ya.
Who was that man?
- Where the hell's the food?
- I'll go check.
Tell him we're starving.
You know, I've been watching her and she really likes you.
Seriously, she likes you.
- Come on, Charlie.
- No, I'm serious.
Watch.
Who do you like better?
Me or him?
Me, Charlie fun, you know, crazy guy, right.
Or him?
I rest my case, Jesse.
0w!
All right. Well, if everybody's hungry, dig in while it's hot.
Jess, shouldn't we say grace, you know, say a few nice words about God or whoever?
Oh.
All right. Uh, I guess I'd just like to thank everyone for their special contribution to the meal.
And to say that I guess I think of all of you as, well, my family now.
That was well put, son.
Now, let's eat.
Slim.
You low-down weasel.
I've been waiting for you.
(Demonic voice) Long time, partner.
(Gramps) Charlie!
He's mine.
I knew you'd catch up with me sooner or later.
Gramps!
Gramps.
Charlie!
After all this time.
He got me.
You're going to need this.
He's the one that killed your ma and pa.
Oh, my God.
Charlie!
(Demonic voice) Jesse.
You and you, come with me around back.
(On radio): 'Hostage sniper hold-up in the 175 Wood Acre Drive...'
- What's up, Vinnie?
- Sheriff, we got a crazy in there
- shooting up the whole neighborhood.
- The old McLaughlin place.
That's right. We just found who owns the place. Jesse McLaughlin.
It's old Clarence's son.
Just moved in a couple of days ago.
- Clarence's son?
- Yeah.
He's moving out tonight.
Let me talk to that son.
- What's his name?
- Jesse.
(Loudspeaker) Jesse.
We got the place surrounded.
Why don't you come out peacefully and give yourself up?
We don't want anybody to get hurt.
(Slim) Now, it's mine.
Get down. Hold your fire.
What the hell's going on in there?
(Groans) Jesse!
(Sheriff) Hold your fire!
Did you blow his head off?
(Chuckling) That's a good boy.
I thought for sure he'd kick your ass.
- But I didn't let on though, did I, son?
- No.
No, you didn't, Gramps.
This is it, kid.
You're not going to die.
The skull is right here.
It don't make no difference no more, son.
I've done all I can do in this world.
And it's time to move on.
No. No, don't.
Now, you get what you want from this old skull.
I got something real special.
I got to meet my great-great-grandson and I had a hell of a time.
You figure what you want and then get rid of the goddamn thing.
No.
Come on.
Come on, (Stamps.
Hold on.
Hold on, Gramps.
I love you, Gramps.
I love you too, Jesse.
(Sheriff) Jesse, this is your last chance.
Come out with your hands up.
I'm going to count to ten and then we're coming in firing.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine...
Agh!
- Take cover!
- Gun fired!
(Jesse) Yee-haw!
Bear witness, Zeus...
...and all you gods of high Olympus! l condemn my daughter, Danae...
...and her son, Perseus, to the sea!
Her guilt and sin...
...have brought shame to Argos. l, Acrisius, the king...
...now purge her crime and restore my honor!
Their blood is not on my hands!
Now! lt is done.
As we feared, King Acrisius of Argos has abandoned his daughter...
...and her child to the sea.
Then he will be punished.
Cruel and ruthless crime! Blasphemy!
How dare the tyrant pray to me to forgive his savage jealousy...
...and cowardly revenge!
Acrisius has always shown devotion to the gods of Olympus!
He has built many temples and dedicated them to you...
...great Zeus, father of the gods.
A hundred good deeds cannot atone for one murder.
A thousand temples or statues, or sanctuaries...
...whether dedicated to me, or to you,
Hera, my wife...
...or to Thetis, lovely goddess of the sea.
Or to you, Athena, ever wise and full of care.
Or to Aphrodite, goddess of love.
Nothing can wipe out or forgive...
...this one contemptible act of blood!
Does it matter?
The death of a girl and her child?
Girl? His daughter!
- After a lifetime's devotion...
- Enough! l've decided.
Acrisius must be punished...
...and his people with him.
My lord, Poseidon...
...l command you to raise the wind and the sea.
Destroy Argos!
And to make certain no stone stands, that no creature crawls...
...l command you to let loose the last of the Titans.
Let loose the Kraken!
The kingdom of Acrisius must be destroyed!
As you command.
Yet, be certain...
...no harm befalls young Danae or her son.
Bring them safe to some remote and peaceful shore. Go now, swiftly.
No pity, no mercy. Why?
Zeus, your husband, loved the girl.
- Danae?
- She is very beautiful.
So beautiful that Acrisius grew jealous and guarded her from men...
...locked behind iron doors.
But Zeus transformed himself into a shower of gold and visited her...
...visted her and loved her.
- Then why should l show compassion?
- Let her drown! With her child!
- The child, Perseus, is Zeus' son.
That is why he is to be saved...
...and why Argos is doomed.
Danae and her child have been brought safely to the island of Seriphos.
Seriphos.
There let Danae and her child live, safe...
...and happy.
Perseus, grown to a young man.
He's had a happy childhood. With a strong body and a handsome face...
...what more could any mortal desire or deserve?
And what of my son Calibos?
His crimes are unforgivable.
- Be merciful to him. Show pity.
- lmpossible!
Calibos...
...had every advantage!
You, as patron goddess of the city of Joppa, have spoiled...
...and indulged him since birth.
You let him rule the Wells of the Moon, and he destroyed every living creature!
He's trapped and killed my sacred herd of flying horses...
...and now only the stallion,
Pegasus, remains.
- Your son must therefore be punished.
- No, l beg you. Be merciful.
He will become abhorrent to human sight.
He'll be shunned and forced to live as an outcast in the swamps and marshes.
He'll be transformed to a mortal mockery.
The shameful mark of his vile cruelty.
This is my final judgement.
No, l implore you.
He is to marry Princess Andromeda.
He would rule all Joppa and Phoenicia.
Let the princess look upon him now!
Be comforted. He may change his mind.
Had it been his own child Perseus, he would have forgiven him.
But for my son Calibos, there is to be no mercy, no hope.
- And no marriage with Andromeda.
- How can there be now?
Yet if my son...
...is not to marry her...
...then no man will.
My priests of Joppa are loyal. l will speak to them in dreams and omens.
As my Calibos suffers...
...so will Andromeda. l promise you.
The son of Zeus is to be left to the whim of chance...
... while mine is punished with deformity.
It is time for chance to intervene.
Time you saw something of the world, Perseus.
Time you came face to face with fear.
Time to know the terrors of the dark and look on death.
Time your eyes were opened to grim reality.
Far to the east, across the sea...
...in Joppa...
...in the kingdom of Phoenicia.
Who are you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
Who are you?
- First tell me where l am!
- "Where"?
Where am l?
You mean you don't know where you are? l don't know.
Now let's be patient for a moment.
My name is Ammon. l am a poet and a playwright.
And you?
My name is Perseus.
- l am heir to the kingdom of Argos.
- By the gods!
How did you get here? l'm not sure l know where "here" is.
Well, this is the amphitheater of Joppa.
- Where?
- The great city of Joppa.
But how? l was lying on the seashore, looking up at the moon.
Oh, the moon!
That might explain things.
You see, the moon...
...affects the brain. l think we'd be safer inside, out of the night air. l must apologize for this dramatic finery and the theatrical effects. l put them on to frighten away the curious. lt makes them think the theater is haunted.
- Why is everything so neglected?
- lt's a sign of the times.
This kingdom is cursed, and the city is in despair.
Everyone goes around muttering:
"Call no man happy who is not dead!"
Now then, my young friend.
You say your name is Perseus, heir to the kingdom of Argos?
Yes.
But up to now l've lived all my life in Seriphos.
Someday l will return to reclaim Argos.
- After l was born, my mother and l...
- l know!
- You do?
- Certainly.
The beautiful princess and the jealous tyrant...
...you and your mother thrown into the sea...
...and the destruction of Argos. lt's been a popular story here for the past 20 years. l, myself, wrote a poem about it.
- Rather moving, as l recall.
- Then...
...can you explain what happened to me tonight?
The gods of Olympus are mysterious, and their motives are erratic.
My advice to you:
Return to the calm of Seriphos as quickly as you can.
But my mother's last wish was that l would restore her homeland.
Joppa would be a better starting place than some remote little island.
Well, in that case...
...you ought to get something more becoming to wear. l mean, something more fitting...
...something more appropriate for a prince, so to speak. Get out!
And look at this!
Ah, that looks well.
That will do very well.
Your sword.
Welcome to Joppa, Prince Perseus.
You set him down half-naked in a strange, despairing city?
- Chance?
- Not chance and you know it!
A deliberate and malicious act unworthy of a goddess!
- You accuse me?
- Well, one thing is certain.
My son needs more than an actor's cloak and a wooden sword!
Provide him with suitable weapons.
Weapons of divine temper.
A helmet!
A sword!
A shield!
And he must have them with all speed!
- All for love of Danae.
- No!
So many women have attracted him, he couldn't remember her. lt's his foolish pride in a handsome son.
As you say, so many women. And all these transformations he invents...
...to seduce them.
Sometimes a shower of gold...
...a bull or a swan. He tried to ravish me disguised as a cuttlefish.
- Did he succeed?
- Certainly not.
- What did you do?
- Beat him at his own game. l turned myself into a shark.
Why, you're up with the sun.
Beautiful morning!
Magical! l found this here by the statue.
That is the likeness of the goddess of love. lt's remarkable.
- A sword, eh?
- Yes.
- This is no ordinary sword.
- lt's a strange metal. lt's neither brass nor iron. lt's like no metal l have ever seen.
By the gods!
There's a shield!
And over there's a helmet! l was right to say, "By the gods!"
Who else could make a sword...
...that slices through solid marble...
...without leaving the slightest blemish on the blade? lf the sword can do that...
...what about the helmet and the shield?
We'd better...
That is, you'd better find out.
- l'll try the helmet.
- No! Try me first.
- What did you say?
- l didn't say anything.
The sound came from over by that statue of Hera. From that shield!
Turn me around!
Perseus!
Perseus, Perseus.
Mark me, Perseus.
These weapons are gifts from the gods.
Guard well this shield...
... for one day it will guard your life.
Guard my life?
- When?
- You will know...
... when the day comes.
- What about the helmet?
- It has the power...
... to render its wearer...
... invisible. lnvisible?
Invisible.
Wait!
Wait. Who are you?
Find and fulfill your destiny.
Destiny?
A divine gift should never be questioned...
...simply accepted. lnvisible.
Can you see me?
Nothing.
Nothing of you at all!
Where are you?
- l'm invisible! Can't you see that?
- l can only see footsteps.
The gods are truly remarkable.
Perseus...
...where are you going?
To Joppa!
Your sword!
Oh, impetuous...
...foolish...
Ah, dear, the young.
Why do they never listen?
When will they ever learn?
A stranger here?
A stranger to sights like these.
- Was he a criminal?
- No.
He was a suitor for the Princess Andromeda.
That woman over there is her mother,
Queen Cassiopeia.
A royal suitor? Burned?
A suitor, yes, but not royal.
- l don't understand.
- These are strange times, my friend.
Andromeda was destined to marry Prince Calibos.
Then he was struck down, deformed, punished by the gods.
Andromeda refused to marry him.
The priests prayed, read the signs...
...and declared that Thetis was angry.
Since then, any man may present himself as a suitor.
- l wonder that any man would even try.
- Andromeda is very beautiful.
Besides, whoever marries her will rule the entire kingdom.
For that, men are willing to die.
- They have only to solve a riddle.
- A riddle?
- ls that all?
- The riddle changes for each suitor.
And those who fail...
...do not tell what they were asked.
And this Calibos...
...what of him?
- We live in fear of him.
Fear of what he may do in vengeance against Andromeda.
- Where is she?
- ln the highest tower...
...above this smoke and stench.
She will not speak or eat in protest of this ritual.
She remains alone, away from these accursed, hell-sent swarms...
...of blood-gutted marsh flies.
Thank you, friend.
Andromeda. l've found my destiny.
Calibos.
The vulture flew toward the east.
Toward the swamps! Toward the lair of the Lord of the Marsh.
We must find a way to follow the bird. lf and when it appears to the princess again.
Yes.
But how are we going to follow a creature that flies through the air?
There just might be a chance, you see.
Remote, l grant you.
Tonight!
When the full moon shines on the water, they say...
...Pegasus, the last of the winged horses, comes to drink.
Listen!
Look there!
- l see nothing.
- Over there!
Pegasus!
That's it, that's it. Easy, easy.
Whoa, easy.
Easy!
That's it.
Steady, steady.
That's it, that's it, that's it!
Good boy, good boy.
The most beautiful stallion in the world. But thirsty. l'm not surprised. l could do with something myself.
Here. Stay with him.
Pegasus.
You're beautiful. Now don't you fret.
Your friend will be back in a moment.
- Slow, slow.
- Pegasus.
- We did it!
- No, you did it. You did it!
A gift for you.
Calibos, why have you summoned me here again?
Because if l cannot look upon your true beauty...
...l can see its mirror, and remember how you once...
...loved me.
Remember me how l was. l remember, but now...
Then it is time for you to learn a new mystery, a new question!
No, l beg you. No more bonfires.
Mark well, Andromeda.
A new question...
...for a would-be hero.
Mark, and remember.
When the time comes...
...when the next suitor presents himself...
...you will remember.
Calibos, l implore you...
...lift your curse from Joppa and release my soul.
Show pity, Calibos.
As you loved me once...
...be merciful now.
Go.
Pegasus!
Pegasus!
Pegasus!
Once again l, Cassiopeia, the queen...
...present to you my daughter,
Andromeda. lf there is any man here worthy to seek her hand in marriage...
...let him make himself known! ls there no one?
No man worthy in my whole wide kingdom of Phoenicia?
No man of courage in the whole world?
Who are you?
Perseus, prince and heir to the kingdom of Argos.
You!
You know him?
Only...
...from a dream. l beg you, abandon me.
Ask your riddle. ln my mind's eyes l see...
...three circles joined in priceless, graceful harmony.
Two full as the moon.
One hollow as a crown.
Two from the sea, five fathoms down.
One from the earth, deep under the ground.
The whole, a mark of high renown.
Tell me, what can it be?
Have courage, princess.
What can it be?
Three circles joined.
Two moons and a crown.
- Tell me!
- The answer is a ring!
Two pearls in a circle of gold!
The ring of the Lord of the Marsh.
The pearl ring of Calibos.
Here, on the claw hand of Calibos himself!
The ring. A gift from his mother...
...the goddess Thetis. ls that the answer? ls that the answer? Tell me!
Yes.
We fought in the swamp! l spared his life on one condition.
That he renounce his curse.
There will be no more bonfires.
No more nightmares.
Light has conquered darkness.
You're free.
Thetis, divine goddess of the sea.
Hear the prayer of your son Calibos.
Show me the way to justice.
Show me how to punish Perseus for this blasphemy!
Look on this! ln wounding me...
...he has insulted you!
Then surely he must be punished.
Show me.
Help me.
Perseus is protected by Zeus himself.
There is nothing I can do.
Then punish those that Perseus loves!
The queen, Andromeda...
...the people of Joppa!
Persuade your devoted Lord Poseidon...
...to let loose the Kraken on the city.
Let the Kraken destroy Joppa...
...as it destroyed Argos! l demand justice!
Justice, or revenge?
- Did you love Calibos?
- Before he was punished?
No, it was never love.
He was handsome and fascinating. l was very young.
- And now?
- Now l feel pity for him.
When you fought in the swamp, why didn't you kill him?
Perhaps because l too felt pity. l still don't understand.
We met today and yet you say you've loved me for much longer. l did see you once. l saw you asleep.
- From then on l was hopelessly lost.
- Asleep?
Just believe me when l say...
...that l did see you.
And the sight of you passed straight through me like an arrow. lt astonished me.
From that moment, l knew that l would do anything for you.
From that moment...
...l knew that l loved you.
As l bind their hands with this silken thread...
...bear witness that as she is my heiress...
...so Perseus becomes my heir.
As she is my daughter...
...so Perseus becomes my son. l give her to the man who has saved us from despair. l give Andromeda...
...the most beautiful of all prizes...
...more beautiful than anything on earth...
...or in heaven. Even more lovely...
...than the goddess Thetis herself.
Hear me, vain and foolish mortal woman.
You dare compare your daughter's beauty to mine in my own sanctuary?
You will repent your boast and the cruel injury...
... you have inflicted on my son Calibos.
Forgive! Forgive...
In 30 days, on the eve of the longest day of the year...
... Andromeda must be taken to the Sacrificial Rock by the sea...
... there bound and chained to the stone...
... she must be unknown to man, a virgin.
A sacrifice suitable for the Kraken.
She must be delivered to the Kraken at sunset...
... or else the Kraken will destroy
Joppa and everyone within the city.
For the insult to me and the injury inflicted on my son...
... I demand the life of Andromeda.
In 30 days.
There must be a way to kill the Kraken.
No.
No way known to man.
- You claim to be an optimist.
- Yes, l am. l believe that man can overcome most obstacles. l've had enough of your philosophy. lt's time for action!
Now wait one moment. l said there was no way known to man.
There might be a way known to woman.
To woman?
Three women.
Three old, blind women...
...gifted in prophecy and knowledge.
They are wise, these old women!
Wise as they are ancient.
- Who are they?
- The Stygian Witches.
They live far away, beyond the desert frontiers of Joppa...
...in the mountains of the North.
- Even if you find them...
...even if they show you a way to defeat the Kraken...
...you may not live to exploit their advice.
- Why not?
- They have a craving for human flesh.
When the plague of Calibos infested the city...
...the queen sent ambassadors to visit the blind witches. None ever returned.
Their shrine lies many days' journey from here.
We have only 30 days left to us.
But we have...
We have a flying horse.
Three days will take three hours.
Take me with you! lf only to the Wells of the Moon. Just to be with you.
- We've searched the lakeshore.
- No sign?
A few hoofprints by the water's edge, but no tracks to follow.
We cannot wait for Pegasus. l'll search for the witches.
No. We will ride with you as far as their shrine. lt is a perilous journey.
- Too perilous for a princess.
- You are not yet my lord and husband. ln the queen's absence, it is l who command.
- Herald?
- Your Highness. lnform the queen we are riding as escort to Prince Perseus.
We follow the North Star.
Perseus is moving into danger.
He will find the Kraken somewhat more formidable than Calibos.
- Your helmet is gone?
- Deep in a swamp.
- Lost forever.
- Replace it with some other gift.
- But what?
- Your friend. Bubo, the owl.
Give Perseus your owl. lt is all-knowing, all-seeing.
Give it to him. lt is my wish.
- My command.
- Never!
Hephaestus will do what he can.
Brass and iron are no substitute for feathers...
...but he's very skilled and ingenious.
Let great Zeus rage till even Olympus shakes.
But l will never part with you, my beloved Bubo.
Nothing. Nothing.
- We could be lost for days in this.
- Look! lt's heading this way! lt's flying straight for us. ls it a hawk? ls it going to attack?
By the gods! An owl!
A golden owl!
Too heavy for the dead branch, eh?
How do you know that?
- He told me.
- Told you?
- His name is Bubo.
- Do you understand all those noises?
Perfectly clear to me. lt's another gift from the gods.
Like the sword and the helmet.
He can lead us to the shrine.
Come on!
Don't worry, my little friend.
Thallo will take you.
Someone coming.
Sounds like a man. A young man.
- Who has the eye?
- l do!
- Then give it to me.
- No! l want to be the first to see him.
What do you see, sister?
What do you see?
Yes! A young man, not plump but well-made.
Have no fear. l come in peace.
Come a little closer so that we can get a better look at you.
- We are honored by your visit.
- What can we do to help you?
- l need your advice.
- Then you must come a little closer.
You see, my two sisters here are somewhat deaf.
- l still can't hear him.
- Suppose we were to move...
...a little closer to him.
Now!
- Noise, what's that noise?
- What, what? Where is it?
Bubo! The eye! Go for the eye!
- Where is it?
- What is it?
- What's wrong?
- lt's gone! lt's got the eye! The eye!
- Don't drop the eye!
- Oh, no! Where's the eye?
- You have it!
- Never fear. lt is safe.
Give it to us. Give it back.
- On one condition.
- Anything!
- We must have it now!
- You will have it.
- After you answer my question.
- Ask, then.
How may a mortal man face and defeat the Kraken?
The Kraken is invulnerable.
100 men could not fight him.
An army could not kill him.
Nothing is invulnerable.
There must be a way.
Perhaps, one way.
But a way even more dangerous than the Kraken itself.
- Tell me.
- Give me the eye and l'll tell you.
First, tell me.
The head of Medusa. The Gorgon!
One look from the head of Medusa can turn all creatures into stone.
- No matter how huge and powerful.
- And her blood is a deadly venom.
A Titan against a Titan!
- You must win Medusa's head.
- She's not going to give it to you.
- As a present.
- As difficult and dangerous...
...as to vanquish 1000 Krakens.
- Your only chance against the Kraken.
Give us the eye.
We have answered your question.
One more question. lf the eyes of Medusa...
...even after her death can turn all living creatures into stone...
...what about the blood?
- Deadly and poisonous.
But you have touched the eye.
As it has the power to give sight...
...so it can make your red cloak proof against the blood.
The eye is all powerful. We can tell you no more. Give us the eye.
- You have told me the truth?
- We swear it.
- The rest is for you. Seek Medusa.
- On the lsle of the Dead.
- At the very edge of the underworld.
- Give us back the eye!
- Give us the eye! We must have it!
- Here, catch.
- Where is it? l want it!
- lt's my turn!
Where'd it go?
Give it to me!
One of you has it!
The sands of time run like quicksilver.
We'll be across these mountains tomorrow, near the lsle of the Dead.
And then, Medusa. l wrote a play about her long ago. l was partial to tragedy in my youth.
Before experience taught me that life is quite tragic enough...
...without my writing about it.
- Medusa.
- She was priestess to Aphrodite.
- Yes, and a most beautiful woman...
...by all accounts.
She was seduced by Poseidon. They made love in the temple of Aphrodite.
And that goddess was so jealous that she punished Medusa.
She transformed her into an apparition so horrible...
...that one look from her will turn any living creature...
...into stone. l'm so afraid for you. lt must be done.
We've no other choice.
- Tomorrow you return to the city.
- No, l'm coming with you.
Then sleep now. We ride at dawn.
So little time together.
So little time.
Sleep now. Sleep.
The river Styx.
The River of Death...
...has strange powers.
So l've heard.
Time to see if the legend is true.
Here. You'll need this.
For Charon. The ferryman.
Remember, one look from her is enough. lf you must see her, use the inside of your shield as a mirror.
Her reflection cannot harm you.
Never look her in the face.
Remember, now it's three against one.
Guard well the shield.
For one day, it will guard your life.
Find and fulfill your destiny.
Thallo!
Hello, my wet friend.
No.
No, our task is not complete. lf you can fly...
Good.
And if he's still alive...
...you must try to find Pegasus.
Great Zeus, below on Earth it is now the eve...
...of the longest day.
Very well.
Release the Kraken.
Perseus has won.
My son...
...has triumphed.
- A fortunate young man.
- Fortune is ally to the brave.
What a dangerous precedent.
What if one day there were other heroes like him?
What if courage and imagination became everyday mortal qualities?
We would no longer be needed.
But for the moment, there is sufficient cowardice, sloth...
...and mendacity down there on Earth to last forever. l forbid any revenge against Perseus.
He has done well.
He will be rewarded.
This will make a fine heroic poem, you know.
Or perhaps a play.
Oh, don't worry. l won't leave you out.
Perseus and Andromeda will be happy together.
Have fine sons...
... rule wisely...
... and to perpetuate the story of his courage...
... I command that from henceforth...
... he will be set among the stars and constellations.
He, Perseus, the lovely Andromeda...
... the noble Pegasus and even the vain Cassiopeia.
Let the stars be named after them forever.
As long as man shall walk the Earth and search the night sky in wonder...
... they will remember the courage of Perseus...
... forever.
Even if we, the gods, are abandoned or forgotten...
... the stars will never fade.
Never.
They will burn till the end of time.

Good morning, good morning!
That was
"A-Billion-and-One Strings," playing one of your favorite tunes.
At the top of the news this morning... there's monkey business in Utah.
A band of renegade chimpanzees... have kidnapped Pulitzer prize-winning poet Lester Charles.
What's the big idea?
I'm attempting to sleep!!
I doing a broadcasting.
Do you mind?
Whoa, not in the face!
Uh, the chimps are protesting...
I've got a mind to reset your alarm... permanently!
Sorry, folks.
We're experiencing technical difficulty... but it's nothing we can't handle!!
This just in.
Domestic violence erupts in peaceful cottage!
We'll keep you post...
Whew!
Can't hear your own thoughts with all the racket.
Holy mother of Edison!
What were you thinking?
You might have broken my bulb!
I'm thinking you think too much.
We need wake-up music.
So when it's raining
Have no regrets
Because it isn't raining rain you know
It's raining violets
Blah!
Va-rooooom!
I'll track you to the end of this carpet.
Come here.
I'm going to get you.
Wait till I fix your speaker!!
Rusetti picks it up and throws.
Cepeda tags, he heads for second.
Wait till I get my plugs on you!
[Radio]
The crowd goes wild.
Can you believe those
Brooklyn Dodgers!!
[Lamp]
I've got you.
I've got you now.
Ha, ha, ha.
Come here.
You dare to cross foils... with the greatest Saxon swordsman in the land?
[Radio]
Have you any inkling who you're dealing with?
[Lamp]
Precisely. A total idiot.
[Radio]
If your saber wags as loosely as your tongue... you'll be run through in an instant.
Defend yourself,
Sir Lampy of Locksley.
- A blow for Richard!
- Ouch!
- A blow for Marian!
- Ouch!
- A blow for Mario, the garbage man.
- Ouch!
And for the boys at the delicatessen.
And here's one for the guys on 5th Street.
No!
Whoa! Ugh!
What's going on?
Who turned out the lights?
Good morning.
Good morning,
Toaster.
- Hey, slots.
- Salutations!
Umph!
- Thanks.
- What's on our lineup today?
What are our instructions?
What are we gonna do today?
The same thing we've done for the last 2,000 days.
Chores!
- Chores?
- It'll be fun.
I'm always up for fun!
Listen, a broadcast from Ebbets Field!
It's the top of the ninth...
I don't understand how chores could be fun.
Not supposed to be fun.
It's work!
I don't like to work without the Master.
Well, okay.
If you don't want to work, why don't we play a game?
- What sort of game?
- What are the rules?
There's only one rule.
You can't stop till the house is clean.
- Boo!!
- Boo!!
- Boo!!
[Whispering]
Gotcha, pal.
Leave it to me.
Hang on to your hats, you devil dogs... because the master bebop blaster... is gonna give you a soul injection.

Hey, shhh. Quiet!
It's the blanket!
A car.
- A car?
- A car!
All right, fellows, steady.
A little to the left.
Careful.
- I'm gonna fall.
- Keep climbing.
You, get that light out of my eyes!
All right, a little to the left.
To the right!
There you go.
A little to the middle.
I don't know which direction the middle is in.
- Can you see?
- Is it him?
Any news?
I'm dying down here.
Is it the Master?
It's him.
He's back!
It's the Master!
Blanky!
Master!
Blanky!
[Blanky Crying]
Was it him?
I'm just curious.
I hate being left in the dark.
I guess we can assume that it wasn't him.
Let's get back to work.
Sorry for that interruption, folks.
We return to our regularly scheduled program... at this time.
Whaa-haa-haa.
Cry, weep, wail and sob.
It's disgusting.
Every time!!
Every single...
Give me that stupid picture.
No, no!
- I'll put it away.
- In the garbage!
- You can't!
- Wimp!
- Let go!
- He's not coming back anyway.
He might.
Fact is, there's not enough facts.
Fight breaks out in peaceful mountain cottage... shocking world and bringing
Geneva talks to a halt!
- Let me have it.
- You can't.
Oh, no.
Ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha.
What are you laughing at?
Absolutely nothing, nothing at all.
I think he was laughing at us.
You know something?
You're a bright little lamp.
Oh, thanks.
Hey.
You guys have an attachment for that kid, don't you?
Yes, he was our master.
That's real nice.
Any day he might come romping back... just come whistling back through that door... and everything will be the same... real peachy keen.
- Uh-huh.
- It's a possibility.
Well, at least we try to be optimistic.
Optimistic?
Somebody untie the knot in this guy's cord.
Why don't you just shut off?
I'm real scared, Kirby.
Are you going to suck me to death?
- Hmph!
- What is it with you?
You act like you just came off the assembly line.
Get this through your chrome.
We've been dumped, abandoned.
- But he loved us.
- That's right.
So what?
He has a family.
They move, he moves.
It's a package deal.
But...
He's not coming back, pure and simple.
Did you talk to him?
They could drive up any second.
You really think so?
I'm not talking to you.
You have a combined wattage of five, maybe less.
It's been years.
It's scrap metal time.
Do what you like.
We're not gonna give up hope.
That's real touching.
You're gonna get me bawling like a baby any time now.
I think you're jealous.
Sure, I'm jealous of a bunch of dimwits.
- Dim?
- Yeah!
The Master never played with you.
Because you're stuck in the wall!
So, it's back to that stupid static again.
You think I don't know what's going on in here?
I know what goes on in this cottage.
It's a conspiracy... and every one of you low-watts is in on it.
Just because you move around... you think you're better than I am.
I was designed to stick in a wall!
I like being stuck in this stupid wall!
I can't help it... if the kid was too short to reach my dials!
We didn't mean it, really.
It's my function!!
Don't.
Wait, wait!
- He's gonna blow!
- Yank the cord!
The fuse!
Poor Air Conditioner.
I didn't know he'd take it so hard.
He was a jerk anyway.
Hey, what's that?
What is it?
A car.
Not another word about cars.
You said it.
Sounds close.
Just don't even start.
Sounds real close.
[Car Door Closing]
[Hammering]
[Humming "Taps"]
Wah, hah, hah!
[Humming]
Stop it!
We're going out to find him.
- What?
- What do you mean?
Exactly what I said.
We're gonna go out and find the Master.
To the city?
No matter what!
How would you propose we're gonna do that, exactly?
I don't know.
Come off it.
Be serious.
I am serious.
You're insane.
If only we were wiener dogs, our problems would be solved.
What?
Maybe it was a basset hound.
You're all insane!
It was a news flash
I picked up about a dog.
In an amazing show of loyalty and courage... a terrier named Grover traveled hundreds of miles... to be reunited with his owner.
The poor critter was accidentally left behind... on a fishing trip three weeks ago.
He had to find his way across rugged mountains... and scorching deserts in order to get home.
Little Grover turned out to be one spunky pup.
If a dog can do it, we can do it!
But a dog has legs.
Ah, don't be a wet blanket.
- Legs would help.
- Brains wouldn't hurt either.
- Lay off.
- Pipe down, carpet breath.
I'm going, with or without you.
I say we stay.
We'll have a new master when someone buys the cottage.
But I don't want a new master.
I want our master.
Well... what about the rest of you?
You boys are gonna need a leader.
Alone, you wouldn't last for 5 minutes out there.
I used to be a mountaineer.
Together... we can stand against the forces of nature!
Were you really a mountaineer?
Sure, ask anybody.
Ask Teddy Roosevelt.
We shot moose together on the Klondike.
You know,
I was thinking... you guys will need somebody bright along.
- Good idea.
- Listen to this.
World War II, the Normandy Invasion... and who dare but Lampy to light the way?
You know...
I thought it would be good to have somebody come along... who's really... strong.
- And loud.
- And grumpy!
And oblivious to reality.
Well?
I just know I'm going to regret this.
[Cheering]
- Yippee!
- Hot dog!
Wow, this is our last fuse.
Good thing we're getting out of here.
I've always loved travel.
The open road, the wind in my face... the flies clogging up my grille.
Yeah? How are we going to travel?
We could all pile on top of the bed... and then Kirby can push us!
No, no.
Hey, what about the Master's pogo stick?
[Crash]
That's no good.
How about we're in the refrigerator... on a skateboard and Kirby can pull?
No, no. Hey!
- Shut up.
- Shut up!
Let somebody else try for a change.
Arise, Hassan.
Arise, oh magic carpet.
We need a longer cord.
We need an alternate power source, I say.
- I guess this is it.
- Uh-huh.
- [Sigh]
- Blanket?
Huh?
Ready to go?
Yeah, I'm ready.
Okay, Kirby.
Hmm, shag carpet.
Look, Lampy.
From here you can see the really big lamp.
Wow!!
I wonder where his switch is?
We are pioneers.
Whoa!
[Toaster]
Can't see the road anymore.
Are we going in the right direction?
[Blanky]
I don't think so.
[Radio]
You boys need a navigator.
Navigator?
I'll tune in a radio signal from the city.
I can take you right there, lickety-split.
[Static]
[Instrumental]
North by northwest.
Watch out for low-flying aircraft.
- Ow.
- What's wrong?
He stepped on me.
- Did not.
- Did too.
Did too!
Did not!
Hey, come on.
How do you expect us to get there if you're fighting?
You mean we're not there yet?
No, not yet.
We got a long way to go.
Oh, boy, you're telling me.
Life is like a journey
On the road that's within
Head says you should stay
But your heart says to begin
So you go
But you don't want to go
Any life worth living
Isn't life just filled with ease
You just stay forgiving
Through the forests and the trees
And you'll go
Just where you want to go
Time flies by in the city of light
Time stands still in the country
There's no time for a fuss and a fight
As we travel the land
And I'd be satisfied
Just to be not denied
To reside with some pride
While I ride to the city
The city of light
Light shines like a diamond in the city at night
When that diamond shines
You know that everything's all right
But you know
We got a way to go
Let us meet the Master
We don't want to make him wait
You just keep a-knocking he will open up the gate
To that city of light
Master is a man with a plan I can understand
Master is a man of great reflection
Master is a man who lays his hand across the land
Master is a man of our affection
Time flies by in the city of light
Time stands still in the country
There's no time for a fuss and a fight
As we travel the land
And I'd be satisfied
Just to be not denied
To reside with some pride
While I ride to the city
The city of light
Hey, everybody.
Look!
- A clearing!
- Great.
Spread out the blanket and have a picnic.
I'm full of stickers.
My bag's full of thistles and sticks... and who knows what else!
Whose idea was it to come this way?
The lamp's.
Oh, yeah?
Who's supposed to be the big shot navigator...
Mr. Loudmouth?
Mr. Big Loudmouth.
- Yeah.
- Where are we?
Give me a second and... listen to this.
It's the top of the ninth, the bases are loaded... and Pee Wee Reese is at the plate.
There's the pitch.
He connects.
Oh, and it's a triple play.
Knock it off!
We should all settle down... and try to get some sleep.
This is my sleeping space.
Nobody crosses this line.
You better not wake us up at 6:00 as usual.
- Why are you complaining?
You didn't work today.
- Yeah.
Go find your own place to sleep, fuzz ball.
Watch it.
Are you blind?
It's a line.
Good night!
Come on,
I'm not the Master.
Go snuggle somewhere else.
I'm trying to get some sleep.
Go on.
[Sigh]
Help!
Don't leave me.
Listen, listen.
What's that?
[Croaking]
Over there!
Oh, look!
Light.
I see light!
Croak, croak!!
Croak, croak!!
Croak, croak!!
Croak, croak!!
Croak, croak!!
Ribbit.
[Humming]
Ribbit.
[Tap, Tap, Tap]
That's the same riff I used... when I was drumming for Cab Calloway.
Like this.
Cut that out!
La, la-la-la-la-la, la
La, la-la-la-la-la, la
Booga-booga.
Boodle-boodle.
Get out of here!
Hey fellas, come look at this.
Whoa!
I'm trying to see.
Look at me!!
[Chattering]
Oh.
No, no.
It's just a reflection.
I'm not a flower.
[Laughter]
Ribbit.
Come on, help me.
They're killing me.
Leave him alone!
Stop it.
Give me that.
He was chewing on the Master.
Time to go.
Bye.
[Toaster]
Are you sure this is the right direction?
[Radio]
As sure as I am honest.
[Lampy]
Then we're definitely lost.
There might be lions in there.
And tigers and bears, oh my.
He's such a baby.
Waa-waa!
What's the matter,
Kirby?
Battery's running low.
We should give it a rest.
Turn out that light.
[Bushes Rustling]
Do we have to stop here?
Only for a while.
Just long enough to lose our minds.
We'll be cannibals within a few days.
You'll be the first to go, dial face.
Hey, fellas, we can stay here.
Look.
What's the matter?
Eaten alive, the poor sap.
Wow, wow!
I thought you were a goner.
You wish.
We are gonna need some kind of shelter.
Shelter from the likes of them.
Come here and say that, chrome-dome.
- What?
- Oh, sorry.
I meant to say
"vacuous vacuum."
Ladies and gentlemen, let's get ready to rumble.
In the blue corner, undefeated champion...
Rocko "The Radio" Ratuno.
Ding!
And there's the bell.
They're on each other like black on a bowling ball.
Look.
["Star-Spangled Banner"]
That concludes our broadcast day.
This is Lowell Winchell signing off.
Good night, America, and all the ships at sea.
Thanks.
That's all right.
So, what's this thing with you and the blanket?
What thing?
All of a sudden you're being so darn nice to him.
I was just thinking, and I got this feeling... that I should be nicer to him for a change.
And now
I feel better.
- That's weird.
- What's weird about it?
You were never this nice to him before... and now you're nice to him all the time.
I don't know.
I'm just trying to understand, figure out what it means.
It's kinda hard to describe.
It's like being next to a new loaf of bread.
Hmm, let's see.
It's like a warm, toasty feeling inside.
Like a glow.
- A glow?
- Yeah.
I think I know what you're talking about.
It's like the feeling I get when I think about the Master.
That's it.
I remember the first time my bulb burned out.
I thought,
"That's it.
"It's over.
I'm burned out.
Eighty-sixed.
To the showers!!"
But then the Master put in a brand-new bulb.
And I just glowed.
That's all there is to it.
That's very interesting.
Good night, slot head.
Good night.
Blah.
Ahh.
Run.
[Wicked Laughter]
[Thunder]
Aahh. Help me!
Help me!
Toaster!
Blanky!!
- Blanky?
- Blanky!
Where are you?
- Blanky?
- Blanky!!
- Blanket!
- Can you hear me?
The battery's gone dead!
We're trapped like rats... small rats with no hair and one light.
Blanky!
- Blanket!!
- Blanky!!
Where are you, you little wimp?
Blanky!!
Lampy!
Blanky?
Where are you?
Blan...
...keey?
Come on, Blanky, speak up!
Just relax.
You've done enough.
We'll look for him.
I am feeling burned out.
Listen.
Lamp was awarded a Purple Heart... for being wounded in the line of duty.
Lamps across the nation were switched off... for a moment of silence in respect for his bravery.
Help.
- Listen.
- Help me.
Toaster, Kirby,
I'm stuck.
- I hear him.
- But I can't see him.
Maybe he's calling from blanket heaven.
He's a puffy yellow angel, with a knob nose.
He's just stuck, that's all. Look!
Help.
[Toaster]
Hang on tight.
I am.
[Radio]
Don't let the tremendous height scare you.
Hey, watch out.
Come on.
I can't see.
Get off.
Watch out below!!
That was kind of fun.
Now get off of my face!
- Thanks, Kirby.
- Great idea.
You saved me.
I knight thee
"Sir Vac."
Cut it out.
I did it so we could go.
We're wasting time.
[Thunderous Noise]
What's this?
What's...
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Kirby, no!
Get the cord out of his mouth!
Don't let him swallow it.
Switch him off.
Just shorted right out.
Cracked up, snapped, sold the farm.
- Poor chump.
- How's he look?
Better than you, actually.
Keep it up, slots.
Carpet-sweeping motions.
He should come around.
Hey, I think it's working.
Kirby, can you hear me?
Wake up.
Wake up!
- Kirby!
- You're all right.
Yeah!
Lay off.
Just lay off!
- What's the matter?
- We were worried.
You gave us a scare, pal.
There's nothing wrong with me, pal!
- Just back off!
- Don't be angry.
Keep your antennas, knobs, and wires... and rivets off my chrome!
Who needs you?
Got to drag you around all the time.
I'd be better off without you.
But...
Especially you, you little rag.
So how do we get across this thing, anyway?
Houdini did this once.
He was out of the hospital in no time.
That's encouraging.
Okay, Kirby.
Hey, we're not dead.
Yeah? Where's some wood to knock on?
Toaster, you okay?
Toaster?
Yeah, I am.
Give me some slack.
Oh.
Wha...
Agh.
Aaahhhh!
Yeowwww!
Help! Help!
Damn thee, thou cursed whale!!
From the depths of hell
I stab at thee.
- Climb on, you idiot.
- Oh, it's you.
Where's Toaster?
He sank.
Are we glad to see you!
I really thought I'd turned in my warranty.
Yeah, until baggy showed up.
I just slipped and fell in, that's all.
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Sure!
You can't fool us.
We love you.
Like Mrs. Roosevelt loved her husband.
Here's the shore.
Everybody off.
Listen to this!
This is President Roosevelt... awarding the vacuum the Medal of Honor.
Blah!
Ha, ha!
That's funny.
I'm dying.
Where are we?
I can't believe this.
I'm really sorry.
Oh, come on.
It's not your fault.
Things could be worse, you know.
- How?
- How what?
How could they be worse?
They couldn't.
I lied.
Can't you find anything?
I'm lucky my backup batteries work at all.
I hope we're not going in circles.
Come on.
Aaah!
I knew I shouldn't have let you guys drive.
Come on, pull!
Kirby!
This is great fun.
Let's make these outings a regular thing, okay?
Inflate your bag!
Help me!
Aaah!
Wow, the poor guy didn't have a chance.
Just ssss, and that's it.
Don't look now, but you're about to ssss yourself!
What? Whoa!
Blanky, let go.
Try to untie yourself.
I'm not scared.
Well, that concludes our broadcast today.
Actually, it concludes... all future broadcasting of any sort.
We'll sign off now with a suitable tune!
Mammy
Mammy, Mammy
I'm coming
Oh l...
I hope I didn't make you wait
Mammy
I'm coming
O, Lord
Ha, I thought
I heard a radio!
Whoa!
Hmmm.
Do-dilly yup-bup-bup
Upsy-daisy!
Whoop!!
There you go!!
Good boy, Quadruped.
You remembered your seat belt.
Ahh.
[Ding-Ding]
A customer!
Seems like a nice fella.
Dingy, but nice.
Heh-heh-heh!!
Heh-heh-heh!
Mister St. Peters is quite an amusing fellow... isn't he?
Oh, you poor baby.
Your bulb is burned out.
Here, you can have one of mine.
Use it in good health... while you still can.
[Ding]
[Customer]
Hello, compadre...
I am in deep need of a blender motor.
Ha, ha!
A blender motor?
I got a whole shipment ofblender motors in last week.
[Customer]
Heaven sent you to me.
I'll have it for you in
2 shakes of a lamb's tail.
Now what did I do with that blender?
I could've sworn I left it here a second ago.
I'm getting as loopy as a polecat... without any whiskers.
There you are!
I found you.
Gotta move you guys out of the way.
[Crack]
Ha, ha!
Whoa.
Boy, are you some lucky guy!!
This was the last one left.
Heh-heh!!
Heh-heh-heh!!
You never quite know what he's going to do.
He's so spontaneous.
W-w-well, how do we escape?
Did you hear that?
They want to know how to escape!
Heh-heh-heh!
[Spooky Organ Music]
Watch yourself
Don't fall off of the shelf
You must be the new boys in town
What's that sound
Is someone moving 'round
Sit down for a spell
You don't look so well
Wait a minute
I feel great
You just leave yourself to fate
You might as well just hang around
It's too late
We've got to operate
Just try to relax
It's a house of wax
Oh, I remember
Frankenstein
Shivers up my spine
Whoa-oh
I'm for getting out of here
No need to shout my dear
No-oh
Who will go to the cellar down below
Trouble is a-bubbling in the brew
While you're down there
Mr. Vincent Price will give you good advice
He'll know what to do
You just tell him boo
He will put the voodoo in the stew, I'm telling you
It's like a movie
It's a B-movie show
It's like a movie
It's a B-movie show
Look at me.
Barf, barf, barf!
I'm a can opener, a lamp, and a shaver.
Oh, God,
I'm a mishmash!
This is weird
It's much worse than I feared
I'll close my eyes and make it disappear
- This is strange
- It ain't home on the range
You just tell St. Pete that you got cold feet
There goes the sun
Here comes the night
Somebody turn on the light
Somebody tell me that fate has been kind
You can't go out
You are out of your mind
It's like a movie
It's a B-movie show
It's like a movie
It's a B-movie show
Ah-ahh
Ah-ahh
Ah-ahh
Ah-ahh
Ah-ahh ah-ahh
Ahhh
[Ding-Ding]
[Customer] Excuse me, the missus loved the blender motor.
Was wondering if you got some radio tubes, too.
Sure.
I got a whole shipment of radio tubes in this morning.
You gotta help me.
I'll do anything!
I can get you bread, mounds of hot cross buns.
Pull yourself together!
Now what did I do with that radio?
I could swear I left it right here... in this very, very spot.
What did it do, get up and walk away?
I really should drink more coffee.
Aha!
There you are!
Ha, ha!
I got ya!
Bo-bub-bup
Kirby, what should we do?
I don't know.
Hey!
I've got an idea!
A-hoo!!
Whoa-oh-oh!
Aaah!
See? It worked!
I told you!
I told you!
I knew!
It worked!
Jailbreak!
Jailbreak!
[Siren]
Oh, ooh.
What?
Did I catch you at a bad time?
Just wondering if you got my radio tubes.
Wow!
Yee-hoo!
Honey... are you taking enough underwear?
Mom, you bought me enough underwear to stock the whole dorm.
Do you have enough socks?
I'm not going toJupiter,
I'm going to college.
- It's just college.
- So let me worry a little bit.
I'm your mother.
[Doorbell]
That's Chris.
We're going to the cabin... and pick up the lamp and radio and stuff.
I can use them at the dorm.
Hi, Rob.
You ready?
Good-bye, Mom!
Take a sweater.
Hey, Plugsy.
- Yeah?
- Did you hear that?
He's taking some old... stuff to the dorm... instead of us.
All right, go!!
You're gonna like this cabin.
Too bad we have to sell it.
[Blanky]
How are we gonna find the Master... in this big place?
Here it is.
[Ding]
Excuse me... could you tell us how to get to...
To, uh...
2470 McBean Parkway.
[Ding]
A113.
This is it.
Go ahead.
He's not home.
We'll have to wait.
Let's wait inside and relax!
But it's locked.
Luckily, my war training included inter-appliance codes.
I will simply render the secret appliance knock... and we'll be welcomed by the native machinery.
Stand aside, my meager companion.
Hiya, pal!
It's them!!
What are we gonna do?
Should we let them in?
Shhh!!
All right.
How do ya do?
Tarry not upon our doorstep.
Please feel free to enter, all of ya.
Boy, you were some lucky kid.
Every summer for as long as I can remember... we'd be running all over this place.
I looked her straight into those big blue eyes.
It was you who killed Johnson.
Parker found out and you killed him.
Then you tried to get me.
It's your turn, sweetheart.
Now you're taking the fall.
There was a shot!
A puff of smoke!
We ran like the dickens!
- And that's how we got here.
- Wow!
Well, something like that.
And all on your own, too.
How convenient.
I mean...
- Remarkable.
- Yeah.
Junkyard refugees...
- in this house.
- What's the world coming to?
I wouldn't sew a stitch on that raggedy blanket.
If you could call it a blanket.
- Looks like an old diaper.
- It smells.
- It's raggedy.
- Get that thing away from me.
- Did someone wash that thing?
- No.
Yuck.
I'm nauseous.
Oh, how do you do?
How do you do?
Hey, look at this!!
Boy!!
He sure has grown.
What a heartbreaker!
He graduated, too!
Of course!
He knows how to work hard.
He's all big now.
- I hope he still needs us.
- Still needs you?
That's the silliest thing
I ever heard!
If it isn't old rabbit ears!
If it isn't old loudmouth!
- Hi, TV!
- How ya doing?
I've got a few more seasons left.
The cottage wasn't the same after they took you away.
Yeah, it wasn't as noisy.
I see you haven't changed.
Kind of gives you a sense of security.
[Blanky]
Where's the Master?
[TV]
No one told you?
Is he gonna be surprised when he gets back!
He just left to drive out to the...
[Speaking Spanish]
- Hey!
- What's the idea?
Oh, many pardons.
Was you watching that channel?
Come on in.
It's the greatest, isn't it?
You guys sure did some weird stuff with your furniture.
What happened?
This is... Gee!
Somebody trashed the whole cottage!
You big dumbo.
Didn't you lock the doors?
I don't believe
I've ever seen... quite so many smiles before.
I've never seen contraptions with so many... buttons and knobs and dials before.
Naturally.
We are on the cutting edge of technology.
- Wow.
- What does that mean?
I don't know.
What does that mean?
[Electronic Beeps]
Since you came here uninvited
We all knew you'd be delighted
This is not the time or place to hedge
No one here would be so bold to
But since you asked and no one's told you
Let us take you to the cutting edge
I can process words accounting too
And my pixel screen displays for you
Computer graphics locked into your memory
With fiber optics cast in plastic
For natural sights and sounds fantastic
Just reach out and talk to your dear old uncle Emery
More, more, more
Everything you wanted and more
More, more, more
Let me tell you what it's for
Here's the printout with the score
Get yourself together on the edge
Ooo-ahh-ooo
You want to go to old
Rio deJaneiro, my dear
You want tojoin in any Club Paradise
You'd rather stay at home where the picture is clear
You get it on the stereo and you don't even have to go
More, more, more
Everything you wanted and more
More, more, more
Any time or place you wish
You might meet up with some dish
Pull yourself together on the edge
If you want a lean machine to whip up some mean cuisine
I'm on the scene totally automatic
I can bake your biscuits too
Pop some dough boy out for you
I'm micro solid-state and that's no static
More, more, more
Everything you wanted and more
More, more, more
We're the bytes and chips to call
You just have yourself a ball
It's all hyperactive on the edge
From LEDs to CRTs, woofers tweeters, antenna trees
An ultra-nylon life of ease
Everything you dreamed of on the edge
- And more!
- And more!
Where's the toaster?
Where's the vacuum?
Whoa!
What's going on?
Where's the radio, the lamp and blanket?
Whoa!
[Engine Roar]
I'm glad the Master has such good appliances.
Yeah, couldn't get any more modern.
They're wonderful.
[Mom]
Honey, take some of our things.
This lamp would look so cute in your dorm room.
Go for it.
What are you going to read by?
I'll buy some candles.
I won't read.
I'll go out.
I'm not gonna take your stuff.
I'll just pick up a few cheap things this afternoon.
That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
Appliances, cheap appliances... available now at
Ernie's Disposal.
Where's a good bargain place around here?
You should have gone for the new stuff.
Oh, were you in line first?
After you, of course!
Pardon me!
I can't take this kind of pressure
I must confess
One more dusty road
Would just be a road too long
Worthless
I just can't
I just can't
I just can't seem to get started
I don't have the heart to live in the fast lane
All that is past and gone
Worthless
And there ain't nothing you can do about it!
Pardon me while I panic!
Worthless
Worthless
Worthless
No, that place is too expensive.
Cheap!
We're talking real cheap!
What about Rooney's down on 53rd?
They've got used vacuums and junk.
This just in.
Rooney's vacuums found to be... carcinogenic in recent lab tests!
Big, big tumors on those rats.
We've got photos to prove it... and I don't even want to look at them.
I come from
K.C., Missouri
And I got my kicks on Route 66
Every truck stop from Butte to M.O.
Motown to old Alabama
From Texarkana and east of Savannah
From Tampa to old Kokomo
Worthless
I once ran the Indy 500
I must confess
I'm impressed how I did
And I wonder how close that I came
Now I get a second sensation
I was the top of the line
Out of sight out of mind
So much for fortune and fame
A bargain in every buck!
A buck in every pocket!
A pocket in, uh, every trouser!
Ernie's Bargain Circus... where you ride the Ferris wheel of values... toward a better tomorrow.
Once took a Texan to a wedding
Once took a Texan to a wedding
He kept forgetting his loneliness
Letting his thoughts turn to home and return
I took a man to a graveyard
I beg your pardon
It's quite hard enough
Just living with the stuff
I have learned
Worthless
Let's go cruising and see what we can find.
Why wander endlessly through the sprawling wasteland... they call the city... when your dreams are all under one roof?
Our roof, corner of 3rd and E.
Crazy Ernie's
Amazing Emporium... of total bargain madness!
Ha-ha-ha!
Ha!
Have you ever heard of this place before?
Looks pretty neat.
Once drove a surfer to sunset
There were bikinis and buns filled with weenies
Fellini just couldn't forget
Pico, let's go up to Zuma
Pico, let's go up to Zuma
From Zuma to Yuma the rumor was
I had a hand in the lay of the land
Get up and go hit the highway
Ooo-ooo
I worked on a reservation
Ooo-ooo
Who would believe they would love me
And leave on a bus back to old Santa Fe
Once in an
Indian nation
I took the kids on the skids
With a Hopi was happy to lie in the shade
You're worthless
This sure doesn't look like...
Crazy Ernie's Amazing Emporium of total bargain madness.
- It's the right address.
- Hmm.
Oh!
At least we'll all go together.
That's looking at the bright side, isn't it?
The Master's down there!
Look!
- It's him!
- What? Where?
Why look, it is him!!
Maybe he still needs us!
Yeah!
Chris?
Hey, these are hard to find.
This is me.
What?
I can't hear you.
I don't get it.
There he is.
I can't believe it.
Freeze.
Here he comes.
[Clink-Clink]
You jump off one side,
I'll jump off the other.
Okay, I got it.
Which side?
- Right side.
- Okay.
I'm glad we don't have to do this every day.
Look!
Hey Rob, come here.
What?
Doggone it!
- He's coming back.
- He'll see us this time.
Run!
This looks just like my old blanket.
I think it is my blanket.
That's my radio.
Hey, Chris!
And the lamp!
Hey, Chris!
Wait a minute!
These are mine.
Let go!
Whoa!
Let me down!
Aaah!
Chris! Help!
Where are you?
Rob?
Chris!
Aaah!
Whew!
Would you cool it?
Get down here.
You're scaring me to death.
Really now.
Why don't you just buy a new one?
Where could I find another toaster like this?
Like that?
Probably nowhere.
Ah-ha!
Bye, Mom.
I love you.
I'll call you tonight.
You forgot your sweater!!
We did good, didn't we?
Yep, we did good.
You know,
I've been thinking.
This college business seems like a good idea.
I can absorb a lot of interesting facts.
I'm picking up a news flash!
President Roosevelt has declared today a national holiday... in honor of those five amazing appliances we've heard about.
So lock up the office, take down the top... and open that rumble seat!
Last one to Coney Island is a party pooper.
From the starlight roof high atop the Ritz... we wish our intrepid little friends... the best of luck... and a fond farewell!
Ah, you're all a bunch of junk.
Another world...
... another time...
... in the age of wonder.
A thousand years ago,
this land was green and good...
... until the Crystal cracked.
For a single piece was lost...
... a shard of the Crystal.
Then strife began...
... and two new races appeared:
The cruel Skeksis.
The gentle Mystics.
Here in the castle of the Crystal,
the Skeksis took control.
Now the Skeksis gather
in the sacred chamber...
... where the Crystal hangs
above a shaft of air and fire.
The Skeksis, with their hard
and twisted bodies...
... their harsh and twisted wills.
For a thousand years
they have ruled...
... yet now there are only 10.
A dying race
ruled by a dying emperor...
... imprisoned within themselves
in a dying land.
Today, once more
they gather at the Crystal...
... as the first sun climbs
to its peak...
... for this is the way of the Skeksis.
As they ravage the land...
... so, too, they learn
to draw new life from the sun.
Today, once more,
they will replenish themselves...
... cheat death again...
... through the power
of their source...
... their treasure, their fate:
The Dark Crystal.
But today, the ceremony of the sun
gives no comfort.
Today, an emperor lies dying.
Today, a new emperor...
... must seize the throne.
A thousand years ago,
the Crystal cracked.
And here, far from the castle...
... the race of Mystics came
to live in a dream of peace.
Their ways were the gentle ways
of natural wizards.
Yet now, there are only 10.
A dying race...
... numbly rehearsing the ancient ways
in a blur of forgetfulness.
But today...
... the ritual gives no comfort.
Today the wisest of the Mystics
lies dying.
Today they summon the one
who must save them.
In the valley of the Mystics...
... there lives a Gelfling, Jen.
The Skeksis killed his family,
destroyed his clan.
Only Jen survived...
... to be raised by the wisest
of the Mystics.
But there is a prophecy.
A thousand years have passed...
... and now once more the world
must undergo a time of testing.
Now it must be healed...
... or pass forever
into the rule of evil.
At this time,
Jen is the chosen one.
Today, Jen's pipe gives no comfort...
... for today his master lies dying...
... and a journey must begin.
The journey of Jen.
Master?
At the time when three suns meet...
Master, what's wrong?
You are in danger...
...Gelfling...
...and I must leave you.
Leave me?
Master, no.
Gelfling, I have told you of the Skeksis.
The Skeksis killed my mother and father.
The story runs deeper than you know...
...and you are part of it.
I don't understand.
The Skeksis will vow...
...to destroy you...
...for the prophecy says...
...you must find the Shard...
...the Crystal Shard.
The Crystal Shard?
To save our world, Gelfling...
...you must find the Shard...
...before the three suns meet.
If not, Skeksis rule forever.
Where is it?
Aughra holds the Shard.
Follow the greater sun for a day...
...to the home of Aughra.
There she knows...
...all the secrets.
Aughra? Follow the greater sun?
But, master, I'm only a Gelfling.
I should've told you these things...
...long ago.
Now it is up to you.
Remember me, Jen.
We may meet in another life...
...but not again in this one.
Master.
Don't leave me.
I hate your whimper.
Quiet!
He is not dead yet...
...my Lord Chamberlain.
Kneel!
Bow!
Mine!
Back!
I...
I am still emperor.
I...
Oh, master, I'll go where you send me...
...though I barely understand.
Dear friend, be well.
Receive your belongings.
Receive them serenely.
Now we send forth Jen.
Watch over his dangerous quest.
Dear, dear master...
... I'll find the Shard.
I'm not ready to go alone.
All right. Alone, then.
The emperor is dead.
Which one of us will be the new emperor?
Oh, yes, my Lord Chamberlain, time to choose an emperor.
It should be me.
- Yes.
- Yes.
Not him. I must rule.
You should be the emperor.
There's going to be a fight.
It's time to make my move.
It's me.
We're all with you.
- Chamberlain, no. Wait. Stop. You can't.
- Get back, spithead!
Chamberlain!
Lay down that sceptre!
I challenge.
Trial by stone.
Trial by stone!
- Slaves, raise the stone.
- Trial by stone!
Get out there! Move!
- Trial by stone!
- Let's pull that rope!
Come on, slaves! Pull!
Slaves, pull!
Pull, pull!
Harder! Pull!
I'm taking it.
Take the first blow, Chamberlain!
You whimpering worm.
He can't beat that.
Let's see what you can do.
You can do it!
Good hit, Lord Chamberlain!
Lord Chamberlain!
Weak blow! Weak blow.
- Weakling.
- General!
The general's really mad now.
- Come on, general!
- Watch out.
Here he goes.
Me, the emperor!
The emperor lives!
Now, by the law, he must pay.
Stop. Stop him.
Take him now!
Get him.
- Strip him!
- Now, let him go!
The chamberlain is banished.
- Away!
- Away!
Now, bow down to me!
I am emperor!
Hail to the new emperor!
- Hail!
- Hail!
Hail to the new emperor!
- Hail!
- Hail to the new emperor!
Hail to the new emperor!
Listen. The Crystal.
- The Crystal calls.
- The Crystal.
To the Crystal chamber!
Hurry.
A Gelfling alive?
- A Gelfling.
- A Gelfling?
- The prophecy.
- The prophecy.
The prophecy says
Gelfling will destroy us.
No. Garthim!
Attack!
Garthim soldiers, find the Gelfling!
Garthim!
The Gelfling!
Bring him to the castle!
Garthim!
Garthim, death to Gelfling!
Go kill the Gelfling!
- Ugly.
- Hideous Gelfling.
What in the world?
This place is weird.
Let's see.
Her name is Aughra.
Follow the greater sun for a day...
... to the home of Aughra.
Some directions.
Who is Aughra, anyway?
One of these things?
Maybe she murders Gelflings.
What am I doing here?
Are you a Gelfling?
Yes. My name is Jen.
But Gelfling all dead. Garthim kill them all. You can't be Gelfling.
You look like Gelfling, smell like Gelfling.
- Maybe you are Gelfling.
- I'm looking for Aughra.
- Who sent you?
- My master, wisest of the Mystics.
Where is he? Around here?
- He's dead.
- Could be anywhere, then.
Are you Aughra?
Are you afraid of me?
Think I'm going to eat you?
What do you want of me?
A Shard. A Crystal Shard.
Is that all you want?
A Crystal Shard?
Drop him.
Oh, no.
Aughra?
What's it for?
Is that what you want to know? You want to know what this is all about?
Is that it, Gelfling?
You don't know?
You've never looked at the heavens.
Everything in the heavens is here...
...moving as the heavens move.
This is how to know when, that's what.
Suns, moons, stars.
Yes, the angle of eternity.
That's how I know it's coming.
How else can I make the prediction?
A thousand years ago, there was a Great Conjunction.
I was there.
Three suns lined up.
That's when the Crystal cracked.
That's when the Skeksis appeared.
And the Mystics.
Another Great Conjunction coming up.
Anything could happen.
Whole world might burn up.
End of Aughra.
Better have your Shard before that, Gelfling.
Now, ask what the Great Conjunction is. What's the Great Conjunction?
What's the Great Conjunction?
You tell me.
The Great Conjunction is the end of the world...
...or the beginning.
End, begin. All the same.
Big change.
Sometimes good.
Sometimes bad.
There it is.
Gelfling knows nothing.
Aughra, what do I do with the Shard?
Heal the Dark Crystal.
But how?
Questions, questions.
Too many questions.
Do you want a Shard? Here.
Which one is it?
Don't know.
Listen, Gelfling.
There is much to be learned...
...and you have no time.
Which one? Which one is it?
It's one of these three, I'm sure.
You've already taken too long,
Gelfling. Hurry.
But how do I choose?
Yes!
Now you don't know what to do with it.
No one told you that, did they?
But Aughra knows.
Garthim!
Out! Get out!
Garthim, get out!
Take your hands off...
Aughra.
At last, the Crystal calls.
It is time.
Time to return to the castle.
Now I've got the Shard...
... but what do I do with it?
What is it?
Am I supposed to take it somewhere?
What's so special about this Shard?
It doesn't look like any...
I don't like this.
Oh, no. Right in the mud.
Fizzgig.
You Gelfling, like me?
Well, yes.
But I thought I was the only one.
I thought I was.
Here. I'll help you out.
- The first thing I remember is fire.
- Where did it start?
It's a war, I think.
A tree. My mother
puts me right inside, and we...
Mother! Mother, the monster!
First thing I remember
is the kind one.
He picks me up. He makes the
monsters disappear, and I'd be safe.
I am safe.
What's happening?
We're dream-fasting,
sharing our memories.
I'm having a bath.
When I was little,
I used to get fed by my new mom.
- She called me Kira.
...and then bigger.
And master showed me
the whole valley stretching out.
I thought it went on forever.
Kira, watch out!
The Garthim!
They capture the Podlings.
- Then I am happy.
- It makes me cry.
My master is family,
teacher and friend.
And I can nearly forget
everything that happened.
And talk with flowers
and the living things.
He shows me numbers
and things called words.
Everywhere I go,
I learn the shapes of kindness.
I learn from them all,
except there's no one here like me.
I need to find...
I love them all,
except I need to find...
- Wait.
- I want...
- It's going away.
- It's going away.
Oh, no. I'm sinking.
- Don't move.
- Don't move? Where would I go?
- What is that?
- Just a Nebrie.
She won't hurt you.
Kira.
Your name is Kira.
We were dream-fasted, you and I.
Fizzgig.
Come on.
Fizzgig!
- You seem very strange to him.
- He seems pretty strange to me.
He's nervous.
Here, Skeksis are watching always.
We must go.
Come.
- Roast Nebrie, my favourite.
- Roast Nebrie. I want the rare piece.
Slaves.
You slime face!
Rotten!
Slaves!
Eat!
It seems to me that Gelfling...
...has escaped, huh?
No Gelfling ever escaped from my deadly Garthim.
More food. More food!
Something stuck in my teeth.
Enchanting meal.
Dessert! Crawlies!
Dessert!
- Stop it!
- Crawlie!
Not bad at all.
Look. The Garthim return.
The Gelfling.
Release the Gelfling.
- What's this?
- Fools! Skeksis fools!
What do you want with me?
This is no Gelfling!
Of course I'm no Gelfling, you putrid lizards!
I'll get my eye to you.
She was with him.
She helped him. Where is he?
Gone! Gelfling gone.
Stupid Garthim.
You want Gelfling, why not ask me?
Easier to send your crab-brained soldiers, burn my home!
Now home gone, Gelfling gone.
Nothing but Aughra!
Mouldy mildew mother of mouthmuck!
Dangle and strangle to death!
Oh, how crude!
Watch your tongue, harridan.
We are lords of the Crystal.
Lords? Not for long.
What about the prophecy...
...that a Gelfling will end Skeksis power?
He'll come, make you crawl, like the worms you are.
Find that Gelfling now!
Crystal bats, fly!
Search the land!
Search the water!
Search the sky!
Jen, get down. Down.
- What was that?
- A Crystal bat.
What they see, the Skeksis see too.
- Did it see us?
- No, I don't think so.
Aren't these the people from your memory?
When the Garthim killed my parents, the Podlings adopted me.
They're my clan.
Come.
How do you say, "Thank you"?
You know the three suns in the sky?
They're going to come together soon.
It's called the Great...
The Great something or other.
It's a prophecy. He told me that I must find the Shard...
...and that everything must be done before the three suns join in one.
And that's all.
And then he died.
Jen, what's the Shard for?
That's just it. I don't know.
I found the Shard.
But you don't know what to do with it.
Jen, this way!
Through here! Hurry!
Come on. Run.
- What was that creature?
- Skeksis.
Wait! They won't find us here.
- It's all my fault.
- That Skeksis...
He saved us from his own Garthim.
First Aughra's, then your village.
I wish I'd never heard of this Shard.
No, Jen!
Jen, they hurt your arm.
Here. This moss'll make it better.
It wasn't your fault.
The Garthim have always come.
Oh, master, I remember the valley.
I didn't understand.
I miss the other masters
with the old, old magic and chants.
I never loved them enough.
Out here in the world, look at me.
I'm not a hero,
not the way you wanted.
Master, nothing is simple anymore.
Master? Master?
Where are we?
- Safe.
- Safe?
I don't think anywhere is safe anymore.
These are ruins.
They're the houses of the old ones.
You mean our ancestors?
Jen? Here's the Shard.
I can feel something.
- Hear it almost.
- We don't go in here anymore.
Bad things happened in here once.
But they were Gelfling, like us.
Yes.
They were all killed by the Skeksis long ago.
Kira. Kira, look here.
Just look at this.
That... That looks just like the Shard.
What does it mean?
And what are those funny marks?
This is all writing.
What's writing?
Words that stay.
My master taught me.
"When single shines the triple sun...
...what was sundered and undone...
...shall be whole, the two made one...
...by Gelfling hand, or else by none."
By Gelfling hand?
Do you know what that means?
Wait.
This is a piece of the Dark Crystal.
- Then that's what my master meant.
- Yes.
- I have to put it...
- You've to heal the... The Dark Crystal.
Prophecy?
- Jen, Skeksis!
- Stay! Stay! No!
Stay. Stay. Am friend.
Stay. Am friend.
Prophecy.
Prophecy cause all this trouble.
- That prophecy?
- Yes!
- That's why Skeksis killed Gelfling?
- Yes!
Yes. Bad mistake.
Skeksis afraid, fear Gelfling.
But you're a Skeksis.
But I am friend, save you from Garthim.
- Why?
- Don't listen to him. It's a trick.
No! Please! Must listen.
Am outcast.
If I make peace, am outcast no more.
- Will you stop the Garthim attacks?
- Yes!
Please, come to the castle.
Please!
Show them you want peace.
Show them Gelflings will not harm us.
Please, please.
- Please.
- Jen! No!
Come. Please.
Please. Yes. Please?
- Yes.
- No!
Come on, Kira.
No! Wait!
Wait, please?
Please? Wait!
Please make peace!
Now I know what I have to do.
How do I get to the castle?
I'll show you.
Over here!
- What's that?
- It's a landstrider.
- How did you learn to call them?
- The Podlings taught me.
Don't be afraid.
Let's go.
- They'll take us.
- But...
Kira, you don't have to go.
I know.
All right. Together, then.
No, Fizzgig. You stay here.
Oh, all right. Come on.
- Hang on, Jen. They go fast.
- Yes.
The prophecy didn't say anything about this.
Prophets don't know everything.
Silence, animals!
You're next, little Podling.
This won't hurt.
We just want to drain your living essence.
Then you can be the same as the other Podlings here:
A slave.
Open the wall!
Now, Podling.
Out there is the great shaft of the castle.
Position the reflector.
The reflector will capture the beams...
...of the Dark Crystal floating high above.
Look into the reflector, Podling.
Feel the power of the Dark Crystal.
Yes! And now the beam will rid you...
...of your fears, your thoughts...
...your vital essence.
You're very lucky, slave.
Only the emperor can drink your essence.
He's here! Close it, slave!
- Is it ready?
- Very fresh.
Very strong, sire.
Oh, it will make you young again, sire.
Young!
Yes, young!
You fraud!
Wait. Please, sire.
Liar!
Slave squeezer!
It always worked...
...better when we used Gelflings.
- Look.
- The ones who raided your village.
Let's go.
Kira.
Come on.
Kill him! Get him!
- Kira, are you all right?
- Yes, but we've got to get them out.
Hurry!
They're coming!
Fizzgig.
Hang on.
Wings.
I don't have wings.
Of course not.
You're a boy.
Yes. A way into the castle.
This must lead into the lower part.
- Come on.
- I don't want to go in there.
We have to go on.
Fizzgig, come on.
Careful.
Which way now?
I want to go back.
I smell death here.
I know, but we have no choice.
- Skeksis!
- I knew you would come.
Do not be afraid.
I am here to help you. Yes.
Come, we'll show them. Gelflings live with Skeksis together in peace.
Please.
- No. Don't!
- Let go!
I'll show them.
My hand!
So, my hand.
Gelfling, you die!
Jen! Let go.
Let go of me.
- Jen.
- Come. Yes.
- Let go!
- Now. Yes.
Gelfling, come.
No, Fizzgig.
You stay with Jen.
- Yes.
- Let go.
Let go! Let go of me! Jen!
I like those grey ones that go mushy when you put them on your fork.
Chamberlain.
Chamberlain, get out.
Get out.
- Gelfling! Gelfling!
- Gelfling! Gelfling!
- Gelfling! Gelfling in the castle!
- Gelfling!
Come and look!
Such an ugly monster!
Awful. So awful.
Royal sire,
I bring you Gelfling.
I have done this.
I have caught her.
I bring you the Gelfling.
I was wounded.
I suffered horrible, searing pain.
A live Gelfling.
Kill her!
We are sworn to kill all Gelflings!
No! She's mine!
But, sire, you could drink her essence.
Because of the prophecy, we must kill the Gelfling!
No. First we take her essence, then kill.
- Drain her first, then kill her.
- Drain her!
Let's take her essence. Yes.
Essence.
Drain her essence.
Take her essence.
As for the whimpering Chamberlain, return his robes to him.
Silence. Silence, animals.
There.
Yes.
Yes. Essence of Gelfling.
Kira, fight them.
Fight them. Fight.
Jen?
Jen!
You, Kira, call the animals.
You have the gift.
Call them to freedom. Loud.
Quiet, Gelfling. Be quiet.
Quiet, all of you.
- Stop. Stop. I warn you.
- Gelfling, free me.
All of you, get down!
No! No!
You've come too late, Gelfling.
The Great Conjunction is at hand.
Now the Skeksis will have power over the stars!
When is the Conjunction?
Very soon, three suns touch.
Jen.
Go, Gelfling...
...I fear, to death.
Get down, Fizzgig.
Quiet.
Yes. Big help you've been.
Oh, no.
Now where am I?
Fizzgig!
Garthim.
Is that the Crystal?
- Aughra, you're alive.
- No time.
No time.
"When single shines the triple sun."
Where's Kira?
"The Great Conjunction comes."
Yes. The Crystal.
This is what I came for.
The Dark Crystal.
The Three Suns.
The Shard.
- Kira.
- Jen.
The Great Conjunction comes.
Now we will live forever.
We will live forever.
- Gelfling.
- A Gelfling.
Down, down. Fizzgig, no.
The Gelfling must die.
Kill her!
She will destroy us!
Gelfling, you die!
Two Gelfling.
- Garthim!
- Garthim!
Garthim!
No!
The Shard!
The Shard is mine.
Let go, smelly hairball!
Fizzgig!
She has the Shard.
Take it from her. Now.
Watch out, Kira!
- Kira, behind you!
- Get off!
No! Leave her alone!
Give us the Shard and you can go free.
- No.
- Yes! Just don't harm her.
No, Jen.
Heal the Crystal.
Kira.
Jen.
Kira.
- Gelfling, no!
- No!
How did you get out there?
Come on, then.
"What was sundered and undone...
...shall be whole, the two made one."
And now the prophecy...
...is fulfilled.
We are again...
...one.
Many ages ago...
...in our arrogance and delusion...
...we shattered the pure Crystal...
...and our world split apart.
Your courage and sacrifice...
...have made us whole...
...and restored the true power of the Crystal.
Hold her to you.
She is part of you...
...as we all are part of each other.
Now we leave you...
...the Crystal of Truth.
Make your world...
...in its light.

[Indistinct Chatter]
These guys are great natural athletes.
Jerry, they're developing... their own unique style of baseball here.
I could file on African baseball on a regular basis.
- Maybe, you know, do a feature or...
- Yeah, that's fine.
But enough of these
African baseball stories.
George, there's an opening on the sports desk.
How soon can you and
Suzy get back here?
Um, about a week.
- When, when do you want me to start?
- Hey, man, we need you by Monday.
- Do you want the job or not?
- Yeah! Uh...
Get the cheeseburgers ready, Jerry, because I'm gonna be home by Christmas.
- Thanks a lot, buddy.
- See you soon.
All right!
Ooow!
[Whistle] Susan!
I've got real news!
Wait till I tell you.
I don't wanna miss Eric.
Well, that's downright Jurassic.
Fourth or fifth cervical vertebra, don't you think?
It's a neck structure of a brontosaurus.
- Small head, slender neural cord.
- Let's carbon-date it.
- We could.
- I'll get it ready.
Paris or London?
Shall I send a telex?
- You could.
- What's wrong?
This bone is about 80 years old.
No.
There's no point in showing me that, Susan, my dear.
I wrote it.
Don't you remember?
This, I think, is more what you should be looking at.
Oh, no.
It's not a giraffe.
- Or am I just a total idiot?
- On the contrary.
You're the brightest post-doc we've had out here.
Don't worry about it, my dear.
- I thought I really had something.
- Excuse me.
- Susan, may I speak with you?
- Hello, George.
I'm afraid that your wife has had a slight scientific disappointment.
- You all right?
- It's okay.
I just wanted to find something real important before I left.
Susan, you know that most field work is patience and frustration.
You're young.
Don't rush it.
In other words, some days you eat the bone; other days, the bone eats you.
Come on.
Hi, Nigel. Ready to sharpen his pencils today?
- Must you always be sarcastic?
- Au revoir, Nigel.
Is that Little Miss
Scientist's latest discovery?
Yes.
From Bateke. She's top-notch at her job, Nigel... whether you like her or not.
- Is it any good?
- I doubt it.
Now don't patronize me, Eric, please. I know that look.
How good is it?
[Eric] She knows nothing.
If these scrapings are from Bateke,
I imagine the photo is true.
- A trip is indicated.
- You do know that Etienne is dead.
Oh, yes, terrible thing.
Fine scientist.
Well, are you going to tell her that we're going to Bateke because of her scrapings?
No, I'm not, and neither are you.
Mmm, the beer that made
Ogbomosho famous.
How about that? I can finally say
"Ogbomosho," and we're going home.
The Post is really lucky to get you. It's great.
It's just... I have the funniest feeling about this bone.
Susan, we made a deal.
I wanted to do something real while I was here.
We'll start our real life when we get home.
What's that supposed to mean?
You know.
- A baby.
- Sure, couple, three, four.
- Four!
- I'm one of six!
- Well, then, you have 'em.
- Well, I'd give it a shot.
Carl Yastrzemski Loomis.
That's got kind of a rhythm.
Jane Goodall Loomis, maybe.
Hmm, that'd be all right.
As long as she could throw a spitball.
- I wanted to find my own dinosaur.
- You'll have a reason to come back.
We'll miss you.
- I'll write. I promise.
- Do that.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
I heard about your husband's job.
Congratulations.
Absolutely splendid.
It should suit him.
As you know, I can help you in Washington.
You choose any school or museum you like... and you'll get the highest possible recommendation.
Thank you.
I really appreciate it.
One thing before you go. Dr. Pierre
Dubois from the Red Cross... is in the lab office.
Could you have a chat with him before you leave?
Sure. Of course I will.
- Are you leaving, too?
- Just for a few days.
In fact, we really should get going. Chop, chop.
- Well, very best of luck to you.
- Bye.
Do you know anything about the Senuofo, Dr. Matthews?
- No, not really.
- They are quite remote.
Ten days ago, a government patrol discovered cholera at one of their villages.
They brought back two patients, both, uh, died.
It was not cholera. It was staphylococcus.
It's, uh, food poisoning.
Do you understand that
Dr. Kiviat and I...
- are paleontologists, not physicians?
- Oh, yes.
But the Senuofo have eaten the same diet for a thousand years.
There's never been a recorded case of staphylococcus before.
They have eaten an animal they can't or won't identify.
This, uh... is what they ate.
- Can you identify it?
- Giraffe.
It's impossible.
It's not a mammal.
Listen, George, it's hardly even a detour.
We catch the ferry, see what's going on.
It puts us back a day and a half, maybe two...
Which are the first two days of my new job.
They've been getting the paper out without you all this time.
They don't need you Monday.
Dealing with food poisoning is not your job, Susan.
No, that's not my job.
But finding out what's with these bones is my job.
Turn off the light.
George, it could be an entire skeleton.
It could be a major find, my find.
Go to sleep.
I said, turn off the light, Susan.
We gotta get up and pack tomorrow.
[Smacking]
Damn!
Susan! Susan!
No!
Bitch!
Pardonnez-moi. Was there an
English woman on that thing?
- Une femme anglaise?
- Definitely.
Is there any way I can charter an airplane?
Oh, definitely.
- All right, let's go, right now.
- Next Thursday.
- No, no, no, now. Rapidement.
- Next Thursday.
Isn't there any way
I can get upriver fast?
I have a friend who has got a very fine airplane.
Would you like to charter it?
Yes, definitely.
Kenge Obe offers a variety of package expeditions... tailored to the individual tastes and schedules of the patron.
I seem to be out of brochures at the moment.
I'm surprised this thing can even fly!
Oh, yes. Well, that is because of the skilled ability of the pilot.
How far? How long is it to Sangha?
A long ways. Long, long ways.
But don't worry.
We have plenty of outward fuel supplies.
Kenge Obe is always prepared for every contingency.
- And this...
- Shit.
The finest of your kind music. Bon appetit.
You like it?

[Music]
Then she leaves me a note like a goddamn milkman or something.
I mean, I gave up six months of my life to come tagging along... in this godforsaken country, six months of my career!
- If you look to the left, [lndistinct]
- I'm sure it's not godforsaken... if you come from here, it's just that... sometimes she's like talking to a stone wall.
- You know what I mean?
- [lndistinct]
Tried talking to her about having kids! My God!
You'd think it was some kind of barbaric custom from dark...
I'm one of six brothers and sisters!
- Is that so? I myself had 19.
- Nineteen?
Yeah, my father had, uh, four wives.
Four wives! I got all
I can handle with one!
I can't let her get away with it.
What would you do?
If it were my wife...
I'd whip the bitch.

Susan.
Got your note.
George, he's dying.
Dr. Dubois, this is my husband, George Loomis.
- Monsieur.
- Bonjour.
Oh, this is my tour guide, Sky King.
- Do you understand Senuofo?
- Yeah, I speak a little.
We're trying to find out what this man ate.
That's the chief.
He's preparing to die.
- No, no, no, no. No!
- Huh?
- [Native]
- [Native]
[Native]
[Native]
Two of their hunters found it upriver.
- Dead.
- [Native]
[Native]
They have brought the meat back and everyone who ate it is sick... or dead.
[Native]
Looks like a brontosaurus.
[Native]
Where? Where upriver?
George, thank you.
You should bloody well tell me my messages as they come in. - Okay.
It is not okay. You make things very difficult.
Okay.
Eric.
Apparently your favorite post-doc and her husband... are now chasing their bone at a Sangha village upriver.
- Where did you get that information?
- Dubois.
- Red Cross.
- Damn it.
Blast it!
We're at the wrong place.
Get me government house.
Tommy!
- What is going on?
- You'll find out in due course.
We're going to need a boat and an escort. Tommy!
She's a persistent little devil, isn't she?
If this is where they left the carcass, then it should be here.
Sounds logical.
It must have washed with the current.
We're gonna have to look over there.
What's downriver?
Hey, Charlie.
[Speaking Native Dialect]
[Native]
No problem.
You won't get lost.
This is the Kenge Obe communications module.
There's a transceiver.
There's a transmitter chip.
You can... You can beep each other.
Also, the wraps and radio, plus this excellent guide.
Rent or buy? Food is extra. I'll be back to pick you up in two days.
Make it a rental and tell him he goes with us.
Hey, Charlie.
[Native]
- [Native]
- [Protesting]
No problem.
[Susan]
Oh, my God! George.
Hey! Where are ya going?
[Native]
"No problem."
What a place, huh?
Something big's been through here.
Look at those broken branches.
- George?
- Come on.
Oh, my God!
[Native]
- Hello?
- [Native]
- [Native]
- [Native]
Amigos.
[Yelling, Laughing]
George, maybe you should give them something?
- We would like to give you a gift.
- Huh?
What would you like me to give them, Susan?
Show your watch.
Show it.
Show them how it ticks.
It doesn't tick. It's a goddamn digital.
Try it anyway, George.
- You like my watch?
- [Beeping]
[Beeping Continues]
[Beeping]
[Native]
Have any other ideas?
[George] Oh, terrific.
It's a convention.
Maybe they'd like my... pants.
It's what they could use.
[George] Susan!
- Susan! Don't! Their soul!
- It's okay.
It's just a picture.
It's okay.
Come on, it's all right.
[Woman Laughing]
Think happy thoughts.
[Native]
Mmm.
[Gulp]
This is absolute "craporama."
Dead ants. Live ants.
I think I'm going to die.
Ah.
Here, uh, try a little half-eaten hippie food.
[Sniffing]
[Crunching]
- [Whispering]
- [Chuckling]
Mmm.
[Laughing]

I don't like it either, boss.
- I'm George.
- Huh?
- My name, George.
- Cephu.
Cephu, how do you do?
[Native]
[Crying]
You okay?
[Crying]
[Kissing Sound] It's okay.
[Music][Drumbeats]
This I like.
[Native]
What is this stuff anyway?
Near beer.
It's near enough.
[Susan] George?
I feel really strange.
Me too.
[Native] Have you seen this thing?
[Hissing]
George, did you see that?
- What's with him?
- [Drums Stop]
Hey.
- They just disappeared.
- [lndistinct Moan]
- Listen.
- [Moaning Continues]
George, you hear that?
Do you hear that?
[Whispering] That's an elephant or something.
Hello?
Where'd everybody go?
I always like to thank the host of the party before I leave.
Come on, let's set up a tent.
Those guys just disappeared into thin air.
And that sound.
I don't know.
It could have been a hippo, except hippos don't... make a trumpet sound like that.
- Spooky, huh?
- Yeah.
I've never heard anything like it, George.
Whatever it was, it's gone now.
- Now?
- Why not?
'Cause the natives might be outside still.
They can watch.
[Indistinct Rumbling]
It's a little earthquake.
It stopped.
- [Indistinct Noise]
- The wind?
The wind.
Kind of nice how the jungle makes noises at night, isn't it?
Crickets and stuff.
- Yeah.
- [Crickets Stop]
Yeah, not everybody gets to experience this.
It's a marvelous opportunity.
George, you're not sorry you're here, are you?
No, no, no.
Really, Susan, I'm not.
George, I don't know if I'm in the mood anymore. Do you mind?
Oh, come on.

Oooh!
Is this absolutely essential, Colonel?
They are fighting men, Professor.
They need their diversions.
I wish you were looking in an area the government controls.
The natives are scared of the Mokele-Mobembe.
I don't think they'll present any problem.
- You aren't frightened?
- On the contrary, my dear Colonel.
I've been on its trail for far too long.
We're like old friends.
Besides, we have our military escort.
[Gunfire]
- [Rumbling]
- Listen.
Come on.
Oh, George.
Oh, my God!
It's beautiful.
Get down.
The wind's at his back.
He can't get our scent.
I need pictures.
Get my camera.
Quick!
Susan.
[Camera Clicking]
- George, look.
- I see.
- It's the female.
- How do you know?
George, it's a hatchling.
It is.
It really is.
Take pictures.
Take pictures.
We're looking at
150 million years ago. My God.
You realize you're gonna be the most famous scientist in the world?
And you're gonna cover it.
[Camera Clicking]
[Roaring]
They might be great, but I don't know how friendly they are.
[Braying]
[Cooing]
What I don't understand is what they're doing this far south.
What I don't understand is what they're doing alive.
Ready? Maybe they ran out of this fruit where they used to live.
- Think that's enough?
- Yeah, okay.
Following the food supply.
You know, George, that's not bad.
- I guess we can get a little closer.
- You know what we've got to do?
We've got to get them used to us so we can stick one of Kenge's radio chips on them.
Jump back, Jack.
Woo! Look at you! Aah!
- George of the jungle.
- Come on.
- [Growling]
- Chow time.
They're getting used to us.
Great. They love it.
[George]
That's it, guys. Pig out.
[Cooing]
Hey, look. Behind you.
The baby. Terrific.
You can put the transmitter on him.
- Hey! Hey, you! Leave that alone.
- [Braying]
Oh!
Susan, he's got big teeth.
Where'd he go?
[Squawking]
- You see him?
- He's underwater.
On the right.
George? George?
[Screaming]
Here, Baby, it's all right.
It's all right.
God, George, you scared her.
No, no, no, stay here.
- Real funny.
- Come on, it's okay. It's all right.
Some food. Come on.
No, no, wait, wait.
Here, here, here. No, no, come on.
Hungry? Free meal.
That's it. Is it...
Look at you.
Are you friendly?
You like that? Yeah.
Look at these ears.
Wow.
Yeah.
Whoa, don't step on me.
Came to visit us.
Yeah.
She's like a little elephant, isn't she?
It's playing.
Dinosaurs don't play.
- It's weird.
- Isn't her skin nice?
I thought it would be more scaly.
Well, you're not so bad.
You're kind of friendly.
Yeah.
- [Growling]
- What the...
[Eric] Use the tranquilizer gun.
In the neck.
Aim carefully.
[Eric] And another.
In the neck.
[Snarling]
Give it time.
[Cheering]
[Growling]
Get back!
Get back!
Colonel, don't shoot!
[Yelling]
[Nigel] Oh, no!
Stop them, for god's sake!
[Growling]

[Moaning]
[Eric Whispering] What an animal!
Millions of years.
Have you any idea what you've done?
- That was a one-of-a-kind specimen.
- No, Professor.
It was one of two.
That is a one-of-a-kind specimen.
Get down! Susan!
- Don't go over there.
- [Moan]
- Shh. Keep her quiet.
- Keep her quiet?
- She's trying to get to her mom.
- Quiet!
Keep her here.
Kiviat, what in the hell are you doing, man?
I was under the impression you were a scientist.
What? You gonna have it stuffed... right here on the spot?
Mr. Loomis, you will kindly keep your mouth shut.
- Secure the creature.
- Yes.
- Don't do it, Nigel.
- Well, I...
- Oh, my God!
- Your prisoner?
We do not take prisoners.
[Rifle Cocking]
Don't! Don't!
Don't!
- Agh!
- Take cover!
- [Shouting]
- Move!
[Gunshots]
Susan!
Run, Susan!
Yeah!
[Native]
Still want to set up your field lab here, Professor?
- We'll have to take her back.

They did a job here, didn't they?
What a mess!
They got the radio.
- The receiver's okay.
- This works.
[Moaning]
Oh, God, George, look!
Doesn't have much of a chance, does he?
She'll never survive without her mother.
Baby, come here.
Baby, Baby, come on.
No, no.
- Come on, Baby. Come on.
- [Kissing Sounds]
- [Growling]
- [Susan] Come on, come on.
Come on.
[Braying]
You know, George, if we caught it, maybe we could beat Eric back.
It could be our discovery.

- [Grunting]
- Hold on to her, George!
- I'm tryin'!
- Hold on!
- Grab her!
Grab her!
[Susan]
I'm trying! I'm trying!
George, hold her back.
It's okay. It's okay.
- Shh.
- [Grunting]
It's okay. Calm down.
It's me, see?
Look, it's me.
Shh, shh.
You'll be okay.
Shh. You'll be okay.
She'll take a bath.
You'll be fine, Baby.
[Cooing]
It's okay.
It's all right. Shh.
[Chanting]
[Growling In Time With The Chanting]
- [Growling]
- Don't do that, idiot!
[Eric] Oh, my God, she's had more than 200 CCs already!
Help me! Help me!
Come on, you blockhead!
Take the rope!
- She'll have to have a stimulant.
- I have it.
Help me up.
Right.
Well done, Nigel.
Really.
You must excuse my assistant, my dear Colonel.
Heat of the moment.
You know, I'm, I'm beginning to take an active interest... in your career and, uh... you know I have the aid of the president.
One day I should like to see you "General" Nsogbu.
For all our sakes, we mustn't lose this one, must we?
Lose one, you keep one.
I call that acceptable losses, Professor.
[Whimpering]
[Moaning]
[Growling]
- [Whimpering]
- What's your problem?
- Are you still hungry?
- [Groaning]
She already ate 200 pounds of of malumbo fruit.
Oh.
Who said you had to make such a pig of yourself, hmm?
You'll be okay.
- Okay?
- [Groan]
[Whining]
[George] Oh...
Get him outta here.
Ow! Get off my toe!
She wants...
- Oh, get off my foot!
- She's not feeling well.
She's just a baby.
It'll be all right.
- Oh, what breath!
- Shh.
[George] Good God!
- Come on, George. Come on!
- Heave, heave!
[Groaning]
George, will you stop fooling around?
Come on. Aah.
She's still hungry.
[George] Why'd they put these so high up?
[Ripping]
Shoot!
There goes my pants!
Wasps! Wasps!
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow!
Ow-ow-ow!
I don't think we're that far from where Kenge dropped us off.
If he waits for us, I think we have a shot at beating Eric.
Nifty. Ow!
- Still hurts, huh?
- Look at the size of this sucker, huh?
[George] Oh, yeah, that feels nice.
- You like that, huh?
- Work your way up right there.
Up, up, now to your left.
Right there.
- [Cooing]
- Yuck!
Come on, Baby.
Come on, come on.
- Not now. Go on, go on.
- No, no, no.
Get outta here.
[Cooing]
Hey, hey, go on.
Get outta here.
- Leave my shirt. Get outta here.
- Out of here.
Play with ya later.
[George]
Come here and plant one on me.
- Oh! Oh!
- Oh!
- French-kissed my nose!
- [Laughing]
- It kissed me.
- No.
- [Whining]
- [Susan] No, Baby, no.
Dragon breath.
Get outta here!
- [Moaning]
- Come here.
[Moaning]
[Moaning]
George, Baby...
Where's Baby?
Baby!
- Oh, God!
- I'm sure she's right around here.
Baby!
Baby!
I don't know how she'll feed herself, George.
She can't reach the malumbo.
We'll just have to keep looking.
- [Beeping]
- Wait a minute.
- I got something here.
- Baby?
- [Beeping]
- Yeah, she's over that way.
[Beeping]
[Helicopter Engine Whirring]
[Susan] It's Eric.
- Do you think they have Baby?
- I don't see her.
Could have gotten the signal from something else over there though.
- [Moaning]
- [Susan] Oh, look at the mother.
- We have to help her.
- What do you suggest?
- We walk in there with a writ?
- We have to try.
[Indistinct Chatter]
Don't you worry.
We'll get you back to your baby.
I can't get these ropes.
You'll have to use your knife.
- [Sniffing]
- I know you miss her. I miss her too.
- She smells Baby on your belt.
- Huh?
You used it for a leash.
- [Growling]
- [Native Shouting]
[Shouting]
[Machine Gun Fire]
- Come on!
- I'm coming.
Halt! Halt!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
They were attempting to steal the people's discovery.
[Native]
It's really great, Eric. Is this paleontology by the books?
Welcome to the People's Army.
- Hey, watch it...
- Hey!
You will stop telling people what to do.
That's a very bad habit you people have got.
You are not a citizen in this country.
You're a criminal and you have no rights.
If that is not clear, we will make it clear! [Native]
- What is the matter with those two?
- They're in a bit of a pickle.
- [Moaning]
- [Native]
[Moaning]
Open up.
So... a brontosaurus hatchling.
Amazing find.
Remarkable object for study.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I... read your notes, my dear.
Your behavioral observations were most impressive.
A little unschooled, but written on the run, I realize that.
You've attached a homing transmitter to the hatchling, have you not?
It can't be too far away.
I think we can track it down.
A hatchling.
That's very dear to me.
I'm going to find it.
You're going to help me, aren't you? Hmm?
Good night.
[Indistinct Chatter]
- [Nigel] Eric. Eric!
- Go away.
No, listen. It's the animal.
Her heartbeat's irregular.
The breathing's impaired.
I told him no more tranquilizers.
All he ever thinks about is being made a general.
Now he's planning to airlift her by crate in a helicopter. She'll never survive it!
Oh, Eric, what are we doing?
Go to bed, Nigel. Sleep. I'll have a chat with the colonel.
[Eric] Colonel!
- May I?
- What is it, Professor?
- More debate about your prize?
- Nothing of the sort.
She's become rather restive and I have just prepared some of this... very special serum but it doesn't fit our instrument.
May I? Please.
Thank you.
This is our... very best stuff.
Guaranteed to reduce her to near death.
Thank you.
And, uh, total immobility.
- Oh, spare me your sarcasm, Professor.
- Certainly.
[Muffled Groaning]
[Native]
Oh, good morning.
What appears to be the problem?
They say that we killed the colonel.
- We found this in their belongings.
- That confirms my suspicions.
- CIA is what they are.
- What are you talking about?
They're trying to prevent us from taking back the people's discovery to the capital.
It's a plot to undermine the revolutionary government.
You're outta your mind.
[Native]
No!
- Oh, my God!
- Don't shoot!
We need them. There's a treasure buried out there.
We can track it on our radio receiver, but we do need them.
- What kind of treasure?
- Gold. CIA.
CIA always has gold. Hidden.
[Whispering] Could be yours.
[Beeping]
I think we're on to it. Lower.
- [Sniffing]
- [Helicopter Engine Whirring]
[Moaning]
[Whimpering]
There it is!
Here! What is this?
- Is that your treasure?
- That, my friend... is the most valuable thing on earth.
But you said gold!
Give me that gun!
Try for the neck.
Don't!
Aaah!
Jump!
Turn back. Turn back!
Hey, babe.
How ya doin', huh?
How ya doin'?
Come on, we gotta go.
Come on, come on!
Let's go, go!
- Let's look for someplace we can hi...!
- George!
What's down there?
There's a cave.
Come on, Susan.
Come on, Baby.
I can't see.
Gotta have light.
I'll make a torch.
- [Engine Whirring]
- Listen. They're landing.
Come on. It's okay.
That's it, Baby.
Come on.
Get a move on, you fellows!
Not so fast.
- [Growling]
- Quiet! Quiet!
George, Susan, show yourselves!
- Shh. Come on.
- [Eric Shouting]
All I require is the hatchling.
- [Screeching]
- What is that?
Oooh! Ah, George!
Oh, they're getting in my hair!
George!
[Growling]
Watch your eyes!
Come on!
[Screeching]
Aaah!
[Rifle Shots]
Don't! You'll hit the animal.
Come on.
[Gasping] Ow!
Oh, my God!
Damn it!
Oh, George. Oh!
The game is over.
Hold this!
Go!
Don't!
[Gasping]
Ohhh!

- Susan!
- George!
- We made it! -
- We made it, all right.
We made it!
[Susan] Where's Baby?
Baby, are you all right?

- What's she doing?
- I don't know.
Hey! Hey!
Over there.
[Baby Braying]
Susan! Susan, there's nothing we can do.
[Sniffing, Sad Moaning]
Well, she's alive.
I said that's all I wanted.
That's all we should want.
There, there.
[Growling]
Hello, George and Susan.
I can't see you, but I'm sure you're out there somewhere.
It's better for science that we have the mother and the hatchling.
I'm most profoundly grateful to you.
Take care of yourselves.
Bye-bye.
[Groaning]
I don't know what she sees in these things.
I think I was starting to believe we were her parents.
I didn't do that many drugs in college.
They're probably gonna dope her silly.
A bunch of grad students giving her a physical every ten minutes.
That's what I was gonna do.
But she likes you.

And guess what I saw downriver?

We steal it back. It won't be easy, but Kenge Obe doesn't worry...
- because it's no problem!
- No problem!
Right!
[Indistinct Chatter]
[Moaning]
How is the little one?
She's just so scared.
I've given her some morphine.
Splendid.
Absolutely splendid.
[Man] Fire!
Get our equipment! Move!
Damn it, move!

Still no Kenge.
We're just gonna have to wait.

{{{ the end }}}
Bring it back!
Do we pull it out?
It's too deep, bring it back!
Don't move!
Griffin, wake up!
What did I do?
We called you, shout at you and you didn't wake!
Griffin!
It's the fourth time this week!
When will you get out of the water?
A cathedral...
...people...
...digging in the earth.
Aw, Griffin!
No, it's true!
It's true! it's true!
Griffin is dreaming...
He's out of his head.
No, no. Let the old men first.
Where did they start?
Do not forget the peddler who was here on Monday last...
"If it finds you at breakfast... and you're dead by noon", he sais.
It's Connor I'm worried about.
If something is abroad,
Why isn't he back yet?
It's been too long.
I'll find him.
Tomorrow I'll go.
Whatever is out there...
...they don't know him.
Griffin...
...the sun is on the west wall.
You're going to be late!
Dreamers will be cold in rags, Griffin.
Leave the Griffin alone.
Wasn't the one you had up there big enough?
There's been enough ill fortune come down on this house for ten families.
If the sickness gets this far we'll need something to protect us.
You're overdoing it.
Come on, it is big enough.
You'll be the leader of the herd, Griffin.
Go on, hurry.
Go on, don't you get cold now boy.
- Cumbria, March 1348 -
This one comes out of the earth, carrying people.
Growing closer.
Do you remember the peddler who brought us the faggots?
"By the hundreds", he said...
"They were falling dead without warning".
To die, I don't like it.
Chrissie!
Go on, Griffin.
If Connor comes,
Chrissie will let you know.
Go down on it, Griffin.
Connor's kinda sharp, he knows the ways of the wild.
Are you right there now?
Off you go.
Down to Hell. The finding of it.
So, how many days has he gone now?
It's work that drives away the worry.
If we put each a spike on our roofs, we'll all be protected.
There's talk about places that Death just keeps tripping over...
An offering to God is making them safe.
An offering would mean a journey, wouldn't it Searle!
We'd take it off to the big cities.
You?
We'd draw back the curtain.
We'd show us the holy rights,
Saint Augustin's finger bone...
And feathers from Archangel Gabriel.
Nothing's been outside of the village before.
None of us have.
And nobody would want to neither.
Look at Connor...
He's still not back.
I start to fear.
I don't want to be in his shoes.
Griffin!
It's Connor!
Go on.
Connor!
Wait! Wait, Griffin.
We're coming up.
Easy! Hold on, Griffin.
Connor!
Easy!
Connor!
Come on, Chrissie!
Faster!
Come on, Chrissie!
Griffin!
Connor!
Connor, you're back! It's a miracle!
Look at them: you'd think they were married.
Tomorrow I would have gone and find you.
How would you been doing that?
I would fly like a bird and I would ask for help for the trip.
You would, eh?
You won't go away like that no more,
Connor, will you?
No, never. Never.
Look.
It is a new method for counting your devotions
They're made out of oak for great lords
Rosewood for rich ladies.
This one's made from sandalwood.
It is a craggy tree, small and tough.
Reminded me of someone.
It's the same tree they makes axes from.
Axes of wood.
If I am a big wheel on the move...
It's because it's you in my heart.
You and Linnet.
Connor!
Look, here she comes.
Connor!
If you had not come back...
I can feel it growing, Connor.
It's already 8 months gone now.
God, I do not know what I would have done if you'd not...
The dog's nose started to bleed and we couldn't stop it.
We thought it was a sign.
We felt for sure that you were lost.
Con'!
Searle! Martin!
Connor, you're back!
It's so strange to see people smiling.
What's happening out there, Con'?
We've heard the stories.
We've got to do something, yes!
We could meet tonight.
Hurry! Hurry!
There's a powerful evil on the move...
Connor has seen it.
A pestilence which makes haste in the full moon, he says...
Do we fear it or do we plan?
Tell them, Arno!
A week back, a monk crossed the lake.
He spoke of a great church being built into West.
He says it's highest in all Christendom.
There's pilgrims come from everywhere.
You make an offering, you stop the Death.
No, the church is too far!
It's beyond further reaches are left off here.
Across mountains, across seas... across places that aren't names for them.
We got to go, Searle, there's pilgrims on every road.
With Connor's to lead the party, we'll do it.
He knows the outside world better than anyone of us.
What do you say, Connor?
I've seen pilgrims, Martin.
I've seen so many bodies there weren't enough living to bury the dead.
I've seen mobs chasing monks from their abbeys for refusing last rights to dying.
It's the same monks that head West as pilgrims might.
They're people no more than animals.
You can trust no one.
Children... begged me for food.
I didn't dare go nearer.
And black boils under their armpits ready to burst and they denied plague was upon them.
All the churches are empty.
And still not satisfied, the evil keeps striding forth with each full moon.
We've got a month maybe two, with a scrap of God's grace.
We could do it.
Reach the church and raise a spike of Cumbrian copper.
With you or Searle to lead our party.
I deserve this chance.
Show the faith.
Here's to taking it! Our journey!
Then Searle must do it...
I am sick of all the death.
Intruders in the lake!
Con'! Come on!
I never thought I'd see the day where you'd stay put.
Now you are among friends.
Don't touch!
We must defend our village.
In the lake!
They defy the village!
Are they armed?
Hey! Look!
Lost looters.
No, there's women and children on board.
Refugees from the East.
They're scared, scared of the Death.
Somebody gather the spears.
It's best to keep'em out of ourselves.
I heard a story once.
In the old pit on the isle of mine.
They reckon there's a hole up there
So deep that if you'd dropped a stone down it, sooner or later
It will fall out the far side of the Earth.
The copper... An offering.
We've got to take the offering, Con'!
To the great church, to the far side of the Earth
Look.
There is no time for your journey, Martin.
It's the plague.
They have the Death and...
It's too late.
It will be up to 20 miles long for Gostford in the morning.
It's full moon, bears its contagion for it like a sac.
As sunrise she lets it fall... on us.
Help!
Griffin! Griffin! What is it?
Are you all right?
Griffin! What's wrong?
- Wake up Griffin!
- Griffin!
Griffin, wake up!
- Griffin!
- Wake up!
What's wrong, Griffin?
The seam, the pit.
In the dream we were tunneling through to the furthest part of the Earth.
You're hearing the clouds again, Griffin?
Leave him. There's signs within dreams, he's been right before.
Like last year's Con'?
The vein of copper in the pit?
Have you forgotten?
Will we do the journey then?
Agreed. I'm with you then.
It's our only chance.
Come on!
And Griffin comes too.
So I carry the cross, eh?
Why should always men carry the weight?
Hey, Ulf! Ulf!
There's a church at the far reaches of the Earth.
It is the greatest in the world.
The pilgrims say that it's there.
And that's this place I will leave the Virgin.
And I will put it there myself, for you, mother.
Ulf!
Ulf!
I'm coming, Searle!
Don't go! Don't go without me!
Wait! Wait!
Keep the fire burning.
We'll be back soon!
Ulf, come on, hurry up.
Always to the front or too far behind.
What is it?
It's what I told you before.
We're tunneling through the Earth.
All of us.
We are using a engine.
The engine is going to shaft for breaking the rock and dirt.
The engine you see, it mixes fast enough...
...to be there before the moon turns full.
The moon struck you daft.
Not, it is true. I saw it in dreams.
And I keep seeing it.
And I am sure that the big black hole is there too.
Come out here! Come on! Hurry!
What the hell?
I think you got a son sleepwalking, Searle.
But I've never been down here before.
You know that, Con'.
So...
It is just like in your dream.
To the other side of the Earth.
We follow the torch.
It's blown by the wind.
It's come from the other side of the Earth.
We use the machine to tunnel.
Take it, take it.
Move back!
Out!
Keep it going!
Keep it going!
More rocks.
There, go!
We must keep moving.
Faster than the moon!
We're not yet on the other side.
But hurry. There she comes.
We must hurry or the village is lost.
Griffin, to be able to break through to the other side of the Earth, that's just two days digging...
...Without the sky, like we have to cling like a tick.
It is further than we thought.
Three times the length of your rope, Arno.
No, all of six times that length.
Before we struck the last hard rock between us and the far side of the world.
Come on now!
There it goes!
Again!
Look!
What is it?
What's that smell!
It's tunnel.
Tunnels under the soil.
Only great cities have them.
Underground sewers where every household can empty its bucket.
My God! It's huge!
Whatever city is up there must be... vast!
I'll go!
Hold your horses.
Not, it's allright. I'll be able to tell them where we are.
Connor, put the rope to him just to be safe. I mean, you never know.
This will help you with the air, Griffin. to find out if the air is poisonous or full of contagion.
God speed.
Griffin!
Griffin!
Griffin!
Griffin.
Griffin!
Griffin!
I can see the sky!
The sky!
All the skies above!
We're here!
We are there.
Come on, let's go up.
Searle, Searle.
Searle, I am afraid.
I am afraid.
It's alright. Come on.
It is as if it was on fire.
Hundred thousands fires.
Torches.
Think how much wood they need for all that.
That's the city.
The city I kept seeing in my dreams.
Lights, water, trees, grasses.
It's all fixed down to earth.
God's goodness!
It makes sense.
Everything flat's got two sides.
And if the evil is our side...
...Then surely God is on this one.
It has to be God's city, alright.
Can you see its great church?
No.
No?
What do you mean, no?
I can't see it.
Nothing is higher than a church spire. surely you can see it.
Searle, in big cities the buildings are higher than a man can see over.
But the boy surely must know where it is.
Come on Searle. Let's go.
Just remember, Con'... there's a run of ill fortune struck our family these past years.
It is enough, we have to take care.
But it must be God's city.
There's so much light...
Where is Ulf? Ulf!
I am here, don't leave me behind.
I've always had to stay at home.
So I'm glad to get a chance to journey out a bit.
You see, I've got something special.
A Lady of wood.
Say, it was my secret!
The little Virgin my mother gave us before she passed on.
I'll put her in the cathedral for her myself.
Con', can you see me placing her as an offering for my mother then?
I am sure I keep remember as we go along, you know.
Searle, come on.
Let's just get on with it.
So pretty.
So pretty.
Ulf!
Ulf, you get back, don't cross here.
For God's sake.
Ulf!
Come here brother!
Give me your hand.
Get in here, by Christ!
- What is going on?
- My little Virgin, I lost it!
Griffin, do we cross that?
I don't remember.
Do we go across lights?
- Griffin?
- Yes.
Come on then, everybody together, then we're strong. Are you ready?
Searle.
The Virgin.
Go.
Wait.
Ulf?
Where is Ulf?
- Ulf!
- You're supposed to come with us!
By Jesus all blessed to me!
Listen to me!
Nothing on your side, you get to the middle. I'll take it from there.
I'll kill the bastards if they try to stop me.
Take it back first. Come on.
It's alright, Ulf. Stay right back.
Con'.
God's speed, Griffin.
We separate here.
I'm going to go on to the cathedral.
We'll never have time to raise the spire if we stay together.
I will travel faster if I'm alone, I can have everything done by the time you arrive.
- You will not leave my brother.
- It is all for the village, Searle.
You take charge here, find the foundry... get that spike cast and get it to the cathedral.
Come on, let's everybody just do what they have to do.
Connor, no!
Take charge?
Find the foundry?
In this place?
All you have to do is use your nose.
Even in big cities you can smell the foundry.
Stench in the wind, still a coarse.
But you take care of the boy, Searle.
Connor!
You promised.
- You swore you'd never leave.
- Move away from me.
Connor's gone, he could be lost.
The city is so big Martin, so queer.
Don't fret, Griffin.
He's the only one who's right for all of us.
And however big the city...
...There's only one church.
He hit me.
Ulf!
Wait for me.
I come back for you, I swear it.
Do you hear me Ulf?
We'll come by on our way back.
Don't leave me.
Griffin.
If there are things in your dream that can help us, keep us out of danger, you got to make sure we know about them.
If we could have kept Ulf from walking into that...
I didn't know!
I can't know about everything!
But if you do know something you'd better let us know about all!
Oh Christ! Bloody Eric!
The bastard didn't even stop.
What's all this then?
Hare bloody Krishna?
They look like they've been in the bush for a while.
The kid's alright.
I smell a toad.
The stench in the wind.
What the hell?
Connor, I've got one.
Foundry.
Griffin, come here.
Foundry.
Nothing broken.
Don't worry, lad.
You're only the last in a long series of accidents.
Hey, Tom.
Come on, we'll dress this in the shop.
Blacksmiths.
We brought copper.
We shield out of the butt, aren't you boy?
Copper, cast it. Now.
Connor said that you'd cast the spike.
You've got to help us or the village is lost.
Please, cast it.
Do you understand these beggars?
Copper?
Ay, Ay, copper. You must cast it for us.
Careful, Arno. There's no pedal!
Smithy. You've got to help us.
Please, Smithy.
Cast the spike.
If it's casting you're after?
Sorry, son, but we're being closed down.
For the church.
Hang on. Join me here.
The church wanted us to cast a pentacle.
Put the scaffold up.
We had this bit lying around here for months.
Waiting for them to scratch around, getting some money..
No money..
The church is poor?
Yes, well like any other business, hey?
When they don't want what you're selling.
Selling?
Hell!
Pour the copper for us, please.
Pour the copper.
The church sent you, did it?
Who in the hell are you?
Cast metal, now
Jesus!
And we bloody thought you were the wreckers!
Good copper.
Ay, Cumbrian copper.
Smithy!
We're a foundry, aren't we?
We cast things?
I never saw a stove like that.
Now we water that spike
No, just let it cool 'til tomorrow.
No!
Before the dawn we got to raise it up by then.
To raise it?
Tonight?
You want to raise this, tonight?
Ay, our man Connor is on his way to prepare the spire.
Have a beer.
Who are you guys?
Ale.
Let's help 'em now.
It's our last night, Smithy.
Give it a bash!
There's no money in this, no one will pay.
But the copper is a tribute.
And surely people have come as we did.
With gifts.
Gifts?
From across the world.
Well, put it this way.
You probably be the first.
Please, Smithy, you must!
Anyone else comin', I wouldn't do it.
Come on, let's put water about it... and we'll put some scaffolding in the back of the wagon.
Now Martin...
...You stay with the blacksmiths.
We'll move on.
Not unless you can swim.
The cathedral is on the far side of the harbor.
That's right! We cross water!
Quicker. Quicker out of here.
Bloody horse. Come here
- Searle, it's stealing.
- Come here!
Push it Griffin, we need it.
Just go still, will you?
Just go still.
This bloody arse is just going to hold us off.
Arno, we need it to wrench up the spike.
Look, you know what happened to me last time.
It only burned, the bloody thing.
Look, you won't get off that thing until we're aboard this boat.
It seems he doesn't like the water very much.
Don't give me worms.
Bring in that bloody horse.
Bloody horse?
Doesn't matter to you if I loose the other arm, but flinging does it?
Hey! You! Bring it back.
If they take an ant for a horse.
What will they think of a horse about a boat?
Hush! Something.
We're never getting there.
We're too slow.
This boat's too slow.
Arno, take oars.
Griffin.
If there's something out there, will you tell us?
I don't like this.
I thought I told you to roar!
I row.
There's nothing out there, is this so?
What the hell is that?
You never tell us anything!
What is it?
Evil... An omen.
- You never bloody tell us!
- I didn't see it!
How could I have seen that?
It's coming against us!
Listen to us!
We're navigators from Cumbria, we've got the right of expedition!
God's faith! Forsaken!
Left me on my own!
Oh God! Saint Mary Mother of Christ, not the ocean deep!
I can't swim!
Everything we don't need, throw it over!
I can't swim!
Where's your damn church, Griffin?
I don't know!
Is it the last church of hell you're taking us to, boy?
Go in, fish.
Don't move!
Remember the queen fish dive.
Above it, the church spire.
One of us will fall.
One of us, dead!
One of us will die at the cathedral!
Who?
Who dies at cathedral?
I don't know.
No?
Not Arno.
Two hands, with hand over hand before he fell.
It's me, ain't it?
The end for me.
I've watched them all.
My wife in childbirth.
The child she died for. Picked away.
My mother. Picked away. Picked away!
And Ulf. Picked away and... Picked away!
No, Arno!
He holds our fate in his hands.
Oblivion, Griffin!
I'm last.
I die. And my blood dies.
Connor. Connor!
I hope you'll see it.
Luck's always been with Connor.
For the love of God, Griffin, tell us.
We can't move until you tell us!
Might be Martin, or you!
Could be me!
I want Connor, I want my brother back.
Oh, God.
Connor!
Connor.
What is it? What's wrong?
None of us is wearing gauntlets.
God's speed.
It's Connor! He's the one who falls!
Connor's going to fall!
Arno, talk to him.
Make sure he don't try swimming.
As soon as we reach shore, we will run like the wind, boy.
No!
It's not fast enough.
I've got to take the horse.
The horse stays with me.
There are right huge shoes, like Connor.
You stay away from these things.
They're not going anywhere.
But Searle! I've got to meet him at the church before he falls.
You'll not leave us now, will you?
Without you, we're blind.
It's Connor.
The tallest spire in christendom.
How the hell did he get up there?
When we reach shore, remember no one travels alone, Griffin...
You're our eyes, you stay with us.
Griffin!
Now what?
Griffin! Don't leave us!
You can't!
You can't do that!
Searle, come back!
Come on! Come on!
Hey, Searle!
Hurry.
Searle!
Come back here, boy!
What am I supposed to do with this boat?
If I don't catch him we're lost!
What about me? Where do I go?
I must catch him to find out!
Wait!
Griffin!
Wait for me!
The fact is, you still have an alliance with the Pentagon.
This is the real world, year 1988.
You can isolate one little pocket in the world...
and say, nuclear free,
You can try, but then... there is no real act.
No pocket, no escape from the real world.
Where is the cathedral?
I will break all the windows!
Get back, boy.
Griffin, come here.
Come here, Griffin.
The spike!
It's coming!
The cathedral, Griffin.
The refuge, make us safe.
I lost it.
I can't see the spire anymore.
Connor...
Connor is going to fall.
I don't recognize any of this.
We'll find him.
We'll find him.
I don't get a chance to catch air.
Clear the rope!
Clear!
It won't move!
The cord is stuck!
Clear it!
Be careful!
We still have some time left!
It's moving!
Get someone to ring bell, Martin.
Signal the others, the city's vast.
I am still lost, it's like...
...I see too much
Which way boy? Show us!
A signal.
Where, Griffin?
Where?
Which way, boy?
Spire on its way, up!
Searle! Searle!
Cover my eyes. Quick. Blindfold me.
Hurry! Hurry!
It's this way! Or here?
No! This way.
Wait.
Ok, take it up a little.
Just keep her right in there.
Con'! Look out!
Griffin.
What's wrong?
Don't move!
This way!
Aye! It's not safe!
Not, it's alright.
The blacksmiths give good instructions.
In Griffin's dream, it's Connor who fell.
It is going to strike it!
Beware the wind!
Hang on!
Secure it, damn it!
The horse. Tie him to it!
Make it fast!
Get back, Griffin!
Griffin, don't go!
Griffin, don't!
Griffin, watch out!
Griffin, stay back.
Con', it's not safe for you.
Safe for no one, the moon is it.
We've got to get the spike raised before the dawn be.
Leave it to me.
Can you do it?
Griffin, your hand.
Here.
God's speed.
Easy, now.
Easy...
Good, now get up there!
Easy, Griffin...
Come on, Griffin!
We'll hear the bells loud and clear at dawn... if they're still well...
The dawn's coming, for good or evil.
There's no time!
There's no time, Griffin!
Come on, boy!
You made it, boy! You made it!
The bells.
They're safe!
Do you hear that?
It was me that fell.
Connor!
Griffin!
Are you there, lads?
The bells' rang this far, you two got in.
Listen, it's Linnet.
Hello!
Con'! Linnet!
It's no one sick!
Did you hear that? Griffin, it could be we've done it!
They're well.
It's a sign.
A dream.
You had a wonderful dream, Griffin.
A wonderful story.
It was like a window opened.
So... Everyone reached the great church but me.
I got stuck at the black hay road.
You didn't get stuck, Ulf.
We don't do it.
We're long gone by then.
You went forth.
You showed the little Virgin...
...the celestial city
Hey, Ulf.
You've been travelling.
The little Virgin.
Could we place her in the great church?
Perhaps do you think it was enough to have shown her the great city?
That's enough.
I did that.
I did that watch.
It was a dream, Griffin.
Hey, but what a dream!
The vision of Hell.
Connor.
You're safe!
- Gregor.
- Searle.
It's fine to see you.
God's speed to us all.
The moon's already turned and no one's fallen down. No one!
It's great.
The village is saved!
Have we dreamed?
Could it be?
The Death!
You won't go away like that, you won't,
Connor, will you?
No, never.
Stay away from me.
Connor, no!
Death...
Connor.
Griffin!
You knew!
You were sick all along! You knew!
Griffin, I...
The Death!
How could you've come back?
Listen, I swear I didn't know. It wasn't far enough while we were in the Pit.
And then I kept my distance... from all of you. I swear it.
Then I was afraid.
There was nothing else I could do.
There was nowhere else for me to go.
And I came to believe the unfolding of your story was...
I came to believe it was my salvation.
The salvation of us all.
But the dream made you safe.
It's true, isnt' it?
It's true.
The plague's left me and ended.
The scars are all that remains.
Are we lost. Do we all die, then?
Not, it can't be!
If the infection's break loose...
Not, because I dreamed one died.
Only one.
It won't break loose!
She will not return to the village.
I want them to know the threat is gone.
The village is safe.
Con', you tell them!
You bring them around!
Make them believe my story!
They must!
You tell them once, you Con'!
They will believe it.
God's speed.
Farewell, boy.
Mr. Brogan!
I assume you called in regard to the mortgage payment on Castle Plunkett... unfortunately still delayed by what seems to be our endless postal strike.
Dear sir, I must once again remind you my first name is not Dick... nor is my last name Face.
It is simply Peter, Peter Plunkett.
No, I was not given a middle name, but had I been...
I feel certain my mother would not have chosen...
"Low-life Shit-for-brains Peckerhead."
Well, you obviously know a side of Mother
I have been happily sheltered from.
Nevertheless, I marvel at your colorfully creative... ever-so-American colloquialisms... which flow so trippingly from your razor-like tongue.
The hotel is in tiptop condition.
The renovations are proceeding at a... What?
- Why shouldn't I bother?
- Peter, who are you calling?
Oh, Mother, will you please get off the line?
Turning the castle into a theme park?
Irish World?
Gee, what an interesting notion.
In... In Malibu?
What is Malibu?
I see. You want to move the castle to Malibu... which I am to presume lies on the western corner of those United States.
Mr. Brogan, if I cannot send your payment... how on earth do you expect to transport an entire castle across the sea?
The number of stamps alone is mind-boggling!
Well, I can assure you, Mr. Brogan, that if it goes on much longer...
I will take this check, which I am holding in my hand...
And personally ferry it across the water to England and mail it to you myself.
That's how much I care.
What postal strike?
Shut up, Mother!
I don't think that kind of language is necessary, Mr. Brogan.
Understandable, but...
So, what you are saying is that... if I don't come up with the money in three weeks... you will foreclose and take over Castle Plunkett.
I see.
Have you heard of the quality of mercy, Mr. Brogan?
No?
You haven't read your Shakespeare, Mr. Brogan.
Goodbye.
Oh, there you are!
Taking the easy way out, you naughty boy!
Mother, this is not easy.
It is very, very difficult.
Just because you haven't got a guest in the place, you're in hock to that fellow Brogan.
Your father's so worried he's tearing his hair out!
Mother, Father has been dead for a decade!
And what about your grandmother, how do you think she feels?
- Mother, Grandmother is dead, too!
- She's still upset.
Oh, very well. I apologize profoundly to the ghosts of my ancestors... for making a mess of their ancestral home.
- Hold that.
- I'm not going to help you.
Mother?
How many ghosts are there here?
Well... there's Great Auntie Nan and Uncle Toby... and that nice Elizabethan lady... and the nun who was walled into the closet... and Oliver's bastard, who never came out of the library.
- Mother?
- What, darling?
- What a wonderful idea.
- What, darling?
Ghosts.
- Ghosts?
- Ghosts.
A wonderful tourist attraction.
Ghosts... Ghosts...
Katie! Katie!
Katie, take this down!
Castle Plunkett!
The superbly restored edifice... in the heart of that incomparably beautiful Irish countryside... also known to be the most haunted place on the Emerald Isle!
Here the dead outnumber the living!
This castle contains more ghouls, ghosties, long-leggedy beasties... and things that go bump in the night than on any other place... on this revolving, revolting, maggot-spinning Earth!
We can promise you banshees, pookas, ghouls of all descriptions!
The one thing we won't promise is a good night's sleep!
But there are no bloody ghosts here.
I know, but there will be!
We'll invent them!
Yes, Mr. Wilson.
The accommodations are strictly modern, in so far as renovations... have been consistent with maintaining the ectoplasmic ambiance... of Castle Plunkett and environs.
Illusion.
Like you, Katie, for instance.
You high on a wire would be magnificent as a flying banshee!
A little dry rot, selective damp, some fungus here and there.
Ghosts need such things to exist.
Thank you.
Patricia. Patricia.
You could be a mermaid... or Lady Godiva.
- Anybody dead down there?
- Only the corpse, Eamon.
What the shagging hell are you doing up there?
Genius, bud, pure genius.
Just you wait till they see it.
The bloody hand to the front.
And the bloody feet at the rear.
Look, what in the name of God is that?
We're not doing "The African Queen".
Would you get me the shagging fish
I asked you for?
Smile, Katie, smile!
You have to smile.
The Americans are coming tomorrow.
Now, Eamon, you little genius, one more time.
Ready, steady, go!
Jack, what are you doing?
It's a little champagne.
To us, to Ireland... your homeland, Loch Ness monster, guys in skirts...
That's Scotland, Jack.
I knew that... I knew that.
Oh, Christ!
- I got it, honey.
- Oh, Jack. I've just taken two Valium...
- and now you drown me in champagne.
- I got it. I got it.
No. No.
God, next thing you know you'll want to have sex.
Ma'am?
- Want champagne?
- No.
I suppose sex is out of the question?
I think I should be the tart on the horse and you should be the hag in the tree.
I think I should go home.
Just give me the hair back.
Bon voyage!
On our left we have the Haughlin Bog... home to more grisly and gruesome murders... than any comparable spot in the universe.
The fierce, fighting O'Flahertys would pile down from the Knockmealdown Mountains... and pillage and rape women and children, nuns and priests...
- We have children here.
- ...even Christian brothers and...
God help us all, the occasional sheep or goat.
Now here, within the confines of Castle Plunkett itself... we come to the infamous Wailing Willow, from which the Brogan Banshee... angis reputed to wail and howl from time to time.
They're coming, Katie, they're coming!
- Get ready to show them all you have!
- Scare the Jesus out of them.
Howl, Katie, howl!
Go on, howl like a banshee!
Frighten the life out of them!
Wave your arms!
Oh, Jesus!
Katie!
Stop the bus!
Help me!
- Driver!
- Driver!
Help me!
- There's a lady on the luggage rack!
- I'm not a lady! I'm a banshee!
Well, there's a banshee on the luggage rack!
The banshee's howling brings forth the restless spirit of Lady Amelia Purefroy... risen from her grave, riding naked on her magical mount!
Hands and heels out, Patricia!
Someone help me! Help!
Awesome!
Oh, Mummy, Mummy, Mummy!
The things I do for you!
Deeply appreciated.
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.
Oh, my God, I'm drowning!
- I can't swim! Help my son!
- Are you all right?
- Don't panic, don't panic!
- What do you mean, "Don't panic"?
Yes, I mean don't panic!
- Oh, shut up!
- She's amphibious, or so I'm told.
Jesus Christ!
This is the end of the world.
Best foot forward, Katie.
Welcome to Castle Plunkett!
You are most heartily welcome!
Ladies, gentlemen, children... you appear to be a trifle moist. May I?
Good evening, boys, young lady.
Mr. Crawford, Mrs. Crawford, Mrs. Clay.
Mr. Plunkett, what is this Whiting Anglais?
Oh, that would be a lovely whiting with breadcrumbs.
- And the Whiting a Nature?
- Boiled whiting.
So, what's the Whiting Vapeur stuff?
That, my dear young one, would be whiting steamed.
And what is this? Whiting Bordeaux?
Very witty, Mr. Clay, very witty.
Okay, Mom, you got us here.
Now, where are these ghosts?
- Come on, I want to see one now.
- Boys!
- I'm afraid there are no ghosts here.
- Oh, a cynic, Mr. Clay.
No, a parapsychologist, Mr. Plunkett.
Duke University.
- A para what?
- A parapsychologist, an expert in ghosts.
Give the parapsychologist a drink, Katie.
Whiting bisque, madam?
Thank you.
And for you, Father, the whiting bisque?
So, I was seeing this guy and he's a devil worshipper, right?
Well, he's a hairdresser, really, but he devil worships on the side.
And we booked this dumb tour
'cause, you know... he likes ghosts, corpses, dead gerbils, that kind of thing.
And he ran off with this Buddhist monk.
I mean, how was I supposed to know he was gay?
- So what about you? Are you gay, too?
- No, I'm not.
- But I'm chaste.
- Just kidding, trick question.
So, what are you doing here?
Well, I thought
I'd take a vacation here in the... in the Isle of Saints, before I take my final vows.
A sort of spiritual treat... Retreat.
Yeah, well,
I've kind of taken a vow myself.
I've sworn off men, for a while at least.
- But you're not a priest yet?
- No, not yet.
Well, here's to keeping our vows.
Mr. Plunkett.
Who's that?
Mary Plunkett.
My great-great-great-great-great great-grand cousin.
She died right here, in Castle Plunkett, 200 years ago.
- She couldn't take the whiting, either?
- Levity is out of place, Mrs. Crawford.
She was murdered on her wedding night... by the hand of her newly wedded husband.
Why don't I just give you both, here?
I'll get the change later.
- Lovely music.
- Shut up!
Honey, everybody's singing.
- Jack.
- It's beautiful.
It's beautiful. It's beautiful.
Wonderful, wonderful!
The full moon has risen above Haughlin Bog.
Those of you with nervous dispositions would do well to protect yourselves.
Lock your windows. Bolt your doors!
Say your prayers.
For tonight, they may be walking abroad... the cluricanes, the banshees and the pookas.
Goodnight. Sleep well, if you can... if you dare.
Lights.
Where did they all go?
Don't ask. They might come back.
Well, if there are any ghosts in this castle...
I hope to God they put on a better show than this one.
It was pretty scary, huh, kids?
Didn't you see Nightmare on Elm Street?
Give me a break...
Scared the shit out of me.
Right. Phase two.
Katie, banshee time.
Julia, where's me bandages?
Because it's hard to get a significant CR reading... when there's no observed deviation to be measured.
I'm afraid that this is going to be the most pitiful scam that...
- I've ever had the pleasure of exposing.
- There's not even a dress hanger in this dump.
Malky!
Get me the nightie you bought me at the duty-free.
Honey?
Oh, thanks, bugbear.
Oh, take this, would you?
Expected random fluctuations of the standard deviation... would need to exceed 2.33 for it to be conceived as significant.
Here we have a very impressive sight indeed.
It's the winning Hereford bull, owned by Mr. Linchum Topper Curry... and he is won the competition for the third year in a row.
Mind you, the competition we saw today was of a very high quality indeed... and the judges had a very difficult task.
Of course, these days the judges emphasize grooming...
- whether it be bull or calf.
- Oh, my God!
Major jet lag.
...if you take a walk around the stalls this morning... whether it be heifers or bulls...
Excuse me?
I don't believe in ghosts...
Oh, wait...
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Calm down, Miranda.
You can stop it now because, really, I'm not scared!
Oh, no.
Well, I've got you, Katie. Calm down.
One more time now, Katie, and give the window a little tap.
- Tap it yourself.
- Away, Little John!
Turn and look at me, you bastard!
Okay, you guys.
If you aren't in bed in three seconds, you are grounded!
- But we haven't seen a ghost yet.
- And I'm not whistling Dixie.
Help me! Help!
Please, somebody help me!
Where's he going?
- Help me! Help!
- All right! All right, I'm coming!
Brother Tony, you have to help me!
- Brother Tony, you have to make it stop!
- I will!
- All right!
- I don't like it at all!
- Come on, Brother Tony, jump!
- I'm coming!
Help me! Help! Oh, God!
Brother Tony, do something!
- Don't just lie there, do something!
- Like what?
- Do something!
- Like what?
Exorcise it! Exorcise it!
You're a priest, aren't you?
Well, I have a little something from Revelations.
- Revelations?
- Revelations.
"Yea, then I saw an angel...
Then I saw... I saw..."
I'm going to be sick!
- Oh, God!
- It's not working!
- We're going to die!
- No, no, no.
- They're going to kill us!
- No!
A change in the humidity and you will turn blue.
Come to me, bugbear, make me a woman.
My love.
Oh, that's the most pathetic display that I've ever seen!
Malcolm!
What is that, a 45-degree, semi-silver mirror?
Now, Eamon.
The sword!
Jack, what are you doing?
I smell something burning, Jack.
Sharon!
How many times do I have to tell you, no?
- I'm exhausted.
- I just saw...
- We are not making love tonight!
- I just...
I just saw a ghost!
That is the most pathetic excuse for sex
I have ever heard.
If I say I'm too tired, then I'm too tired.
Thank you very much, Jack.
Now I need to take two more Valium.
- Oh, my God, he's got my underwear!
- Oh, very nice, a pervert ghost.
- Malcolm, the children!
- Don't worry, Marge, I'll handle this!
Get away from the children!
Supernatural, huh?
Sounds pretty solid to me.
Behind me, children!
How dare you threaten my family, you phony...
Cowardly dog.
Take...
- Go get him!
- Back off.
- I think it's real, Dad!
- I'll show you real.
Oh, mother of God!
You could have shagging killed me.
Maybe if we made love more often, you wouldn't need your stupid pills.
Do not take that Valium.
Sharon, do not take that Valium!
Would you listen to me for once in your life? Sharon, please.
- It's not working. We have to stop!
- No, no!
- We have to try something else!
- Like what?
What are you doing, you brats, to that poor ghost?
- Malcolm!
- Plunkett!
You phony! You fake!
Man! You...
Julia, Julia, Julia.
- Are you all right, my poor pet?
- Oh, you little demons, you. Help!
Now, calm yourselves, calm yourselves, calm yourselves.
As the brochure says: it's the unpredictability of spirits that causes problems.
I would like to apologize for any minor inconveniences.
This is the most pitiful supernatural sham that I've ever encountered!
It will get better, I do assure you.
That's it. That's it.
We are leaving tomorrow morning, Jack.
- Oh, no, no, no, my dear woman.
- Tomorrow morning.
Am I intruding?
Just give the poor ghosts a little time.
Hey, we're history, dude.
But couldn't we look on tonight as a kind of dress rehearsal?
You're finished, Plunkett!
I am going to personally expose this pathetic fraud!
There are laws, sir, against people like you!
Marge, children, we're leaving.
Maybe Jim Brogan will give us another chance.
- Jim Brogan?
- Jack...
- What's Jim Brogan got to do with this?
- Jack!
Yeah, he has the mortgage on the place... and we've only got two weeks left and then he's going to throw us out.
Jack, I'm very tired.
I'd like to go to bed now.
- Just wait a minute. Just wait a minute!
- Now!
- What's going on here, Mr. Plunkett?
- So we told a lie.
Everyone lies once in a while.
So Katie isn't a ghost, and Julia still has her head on... and Eamon isn't a mummy, and the castle isn't haunted.
But what of that?
What you have to ask yourselves is, why did we do it?
We did it because we love this place.
Every little worm-eaten brick, every little rotting nook and cranny.
Why should you Americans care if I lose my home...
Castle Plunkett... and the villagers lose their only means of employment?
Thank you, dear.
Jack. Jack, let's go to bed.
- I care, Mr. Plunkett.
- What?
I care.
Jim Brogan is my father-in-law so I'm involved in this.
You're Jim Brogan's daughter?
Yes...
My name's Brogan.
Well, I might as well tell you that there won't be any extensions on your mortgage.
- I mean, not after tonight's performance.
- I don't believe this.
Daddy asked me to check it out.
I mean, this ghost business was too ridiculous.
- So you came to sabotage us.
- No, no, no!
You did perfectly all right all by yourself.
I didn't have to lift a finger.
Jack, are you coming?
Look, I...
I don't know what to say. I mean...
I didn't know.
I didn't.
And for what it's worth,
I think this place is great.
You're the ghost in the bedroom.
You were the banshee on the luggage rack.
Sharon! Sharon!
Sharon!
Sharon!
Sharon, hey, wait a minute.
Just wait a minute.
Daddy wants this place.
He's always wanted it.
He was born here.
He hates the Plunketts.
- Why?
- Why not?
- Daddy hates most people.
- So you lied to me.
You used our second honeymoon for Daddy.
Jack, it's business.
It's business?
Obviously, a word you're not familiar with.
- Where are you going?
- To get drunk.
I don't want you to lose your castle, not to my father-in-law.
He's a son of a bitch.
Oh, my dear fellow, you're too kind..
He's an unlovely combination of a son of a bitch and a rat's knackers.
What's a rat's knackers?
It's an unholy trinity of a muckraker... a gobshite and a whore's mouth.
The guy's a dick.
In a word. Would you like a drink?
- I thought I had one.
- I mean, a real drink.
Upsy-daisy.
My father's brew.
Perfect.
Don't look at the bad side.
Got to look at the good side of things.
Constantly, there's two sides.
There's two sides to every story.
You know what I'm saying?
Right in here, right through.
Milk of human kindness, Sharon.
Three little words, every once in a while.
Doesn't cost anything.
"I love you."
Oh, shit!
Wrong room.
Our room's not this nice.
- No, Martin!
- Oh, hey, it's not what you think.
- Oh, no, Martin, no!
- Oh, I know you!
- You're the girl in the painting!
- So, you wee harlot.
- No, Martin!
- You'll not tup with me?
- You're the one in the painting!
- Hey, come here.
- Who is this guy?
- Come here to me, you whore.
Great act! Real bruises, too, huh?
Wow, that's great.
Hey, Pal, you should have done this earlier.
I think you could have saved the place.
- Where is he?
- No, Martin!
- Where is he?
- I'm telling you!
- Where is he?
- Great outfits.
- Martin, there's no one!
- Where is he?
- There's no one!
- Where is he?
- There's no one.
- Looks real. Looks real.
- Martin, there's no one!
- Looks a little rough, but real.
Why don't I believe you?
Oh, this is so disgusting!
Mary?
Mary?
Oh, Lord, she wouldn't die, not with a lie on her lips.
- Oh, God, what have I done?
- You killed her.
- Oh, Lord, what have I done?
- I told you, you killed her.
Oh, Mary. Oh, Lord, what have I done?
What did you do? What did you do?
She's a mess!
There's a trapdoor down here.
Here it is.
- Oh, no...
- Oh, no, Martin!
So, you wee harlot.
No, Martin, no!
Don't...
You won't tup with me, huh?
Then you'll tup with no one.
The party's over, all right?
The party's over.
Take your hands off the girl or you're gonna be...
Okay, pal.
- Quick, he's quick...
- Mary!
- No, Martin!
- Where is he?
- Martin, there's no one!
- Where is he?
- Martin! Martin, there's no one!
- Where is he?
What are you doing?
She's a beautiful woman!
- I swear to do, I will kill you now!
- That's a beautiful girl!
- Why don't I believe you?
- Hey, hey, not again!
I'm hit.
Oh, God!
Oh, God! Breath...
- Dirty rotten...
- Mary?
- Mary?
- He missed... He missed me.
Oh, Lord, she wouldn't die, not with a lie on her lips.
Oh, Lord, what have I done?
Oh, Lord, what have I done?
What have I done?
- Oh, Mary.
- Who are you guys?
- Oh, Mary.
- I'm Mary Plunkett.
- Wait a minute.
- What have I done?
Wait a minute.
This is an act.
This is an act, right?
How can I thank you?
For what?
For your selflessness.
I... I didn't do... I don't...
How can I thank you?
You are so beautiful.
How can I thank you?
Thank you.
- Don't go. Why do you have to go?
- Thank you.
Thank you.
I don't feel good.
Sharon, I think I'm going crazy.
I got to know.
Did you...
Did you ever love me?
Let's see if those pills really work.
Yeah.
You've had a good life.
Oh, God.
You...
You're...
Good morning, darling.
Good morning, Lavinia.
Well, our son is an idiot.
We've known that for years, haven't we, darling?
Well, this time he has surpassed himself.
- The ghosts are furious!
- Why?
Well, they've heard that that Jim Brogan fellow...
- is going to move the castle to Malibu.
- How nice.
All that sunshine and all those movie stars.
No respectable ghost would live in California.
Besides, they're Irish.
What would they do there?
Oh, if only I hadn't died, none of this would ever have happened.
Well, you did die, didn't you, darling?
So what are we going to do about it?
Out of my hands.
They won't listen to me.
They're going to give those Americans exactly what they came here for.
Serve 'em right.
I'm dead.
So this is what it feels like.
Like a hangover.
Peter.
Peter, wake up. Wake up.
- The Yanks are leaving.
- Really?
As long as I'm dead,
I might as well tell you.
You've got all the warmth of a penguin on an iceberg.
Yeah.
You're a dwarf.
Yeah, you better clean those choppers real good... so they can chew up the next jerk who comes along, huh?
I'm not dead?
No, but if I were you,
I wouldn't make any long-range plans.
Great, Jack. Now I've got a massive migraine coming on.
My B-complex level is rock bottom.
Sharon, let me see that. Let me see...
Sharon, I think...
Get packed, Jack.
Sharon, you took the Valium.
Wrong pills?
- What'd you have for your breakfast, little boy?
- Some damn fish.
That was a nice change.
I said this place is a nightmare, Daddy!
Of course I sound strange,
I'm depressed.
Everybody hates me.
And last night Jack slept on the floor... and when he woke up, he said he was dead.
And that I was a dwarf and that I had buckteeth.
And you know how self-conscious
I am about those things.
This is all your fault!
I hate this place.
Mrs. Crawford, are you all right?
Do you think that I'm colder than a penguin on an iceberg?
Oh, well, no. No.
You see, actually, penguins are a lot warmer than people give them credit for.
How dare you?
Jack!
I didn't... Don't tell my wife.
Jack!
- I mean, not that I did anything, anyway.
- Jack, we're going!
Do you hear me, Sharon?
Sharon, get on this phone!
- Jack!
- Sharon!
Will you talk to me, Sharon?
You're real.
I mean, you're not.
You're a real ghost.
Jack!
Jack!
I have to thank you for what you did last night.
It was nothing. What did I do?
You gave me my first moment of peace in near 200 years.
I'll be in your debt for eternity, sir.
It was nothing. It was nothing.
And you don't have to call me "sir".
What can I call you?
Jack...
Jack.
Thank you, Sir Jack.
It's on me, okay?
- Lovely dress.
- My wedding dress.
Today is my wedding day.
- Tonight, he'll murder me.
- You get murdered every night?
Every night until last night.
What about tonight?
That depends on you.
Why me?
Your love broke the chain, crossed the boundary.
Oh, my God! Hold on!
You can't depend on me!
Nobody can depend on me.
My wife would never understand. I...
- 'Twasn't love, then.
- Well, Mary, we hardly know each other.
Jack!
Okay!
- Look, I've got to go!
- Don't go, Jack!
I gotta... I just... I... Look...
You want to forget me.
I don't know what I want!
I just don't! I...
Jack!
What...?
What the heck...?
Jack!
He's flying! Look at him!
Jesus Christ, it got windy!
Oh, so all the snakes weren't driven out of Ireland.
- What?
- The snakes...
"To die, to sleep, no more.
And by a sleep to say we end the heartache..."
Peter! Peter! They've changed their minds.
They're staying!
There is a God.
Hi.
Would your name conceivably be Jack?
Yeah.
Welcome back, dear guests!
Let me be the first to apologize for our temperamental Irish weather.
- Shut up, Plunkett! Call us a cab.
- Certainly, Mr. Clay. Immediately.
Deepest regrets, the phones are dead.
The storm must have knocked them out.
- I'm going to get all wet.
- Which way are we going?
- Let's get inside.
- Yes, that's it. Hurry up!
So, we're all together for one more night.
It seems that we're becoming one big happy family.
Oh, sorry, Mr. P.
Plunkett, I would rather walk into town in this suit of armor... and spend the night in a stable... than to spend one more second in this hellhole!
- Marge! Children! We're leaving.
- Come on, kids.
Malcolm!
Oh, my God!
Malcolm!
Malcolm!
Oh, God!
Malcolm, can you hear me?
Oh, please, let him be all right.
Oh, my God.
Plunkett, this is your doing!
- Darling?
- Yes, I think we could stay one more night.
Sweet Mother Mary, Saint Bridget, please don't let him marry me.
Please release me.
I don't love Martin.
Sweet Mother Mary, Saint Bridget, please don't let me marry him.
Please release me.
- I don't love Martin.
- Mary?
- Sweet Mother Mary, Saint Bridget...
- Mary?
Please don't let me marry him.
Please release me.
Mary.
- Sweet Mother Mary...
- Mary!
Sweet Jesus, what happened to you?
- Ran into a little wind.
- Oh, dear.
That would be the spirits in the castle.
Sorry.
What are you doing?
I'm praying to Saint Bridget to release me from me marriage vows.
Look, this is too psychotic for me!
I mean, look...
I mean, I'm as up for a good nervous breakdown as anybody, really... but this is too much.
I mean, I get here yesterday, my marriage collapses... then I save a ghost from being murdered by another ghost.
Now, if you think about it, that makes no sense at all.
Then I fly through the air, hit a tree, and Reynaldo... the talking horse here, leads me to... to the most beautiful ghost
I've ever seen in my...
Last night, when you took
Martin's sword in my stead... you broke the cursed chain that has bound me for 200 years.
What cursed chain?
Me marriage to Martin Brogan was arranged by me father.
I did not love him.
He had warts and his feet stank.
On my wedding night,
I refused to be tupped by him.
- Tupped?
- Tupped.
Oh, tupped.
I get it. Go on. Go on. Go on.
He thought I loved another though I did not.
And in a jealous fury, he did me to death.
Now every day for me is the same.
If I get murdered one more time,
I'll scream.
- Who'd want to be a ghost?
- We are what we are.
So, this Marty stank, huh?
Aye, and he squished.
- He squished?
- Squished.
Oh, he squished!
God!
Could you love a man who belched but didn't squish?
I could love you, Sir Jack.
If you loved me, the miracle could happen.
I can't. I can't.
I cannot do this. I am married.
- Then, you don't love me.
- I didn't say that.
And I am doomed forever.
Even now, Martin dons his garments, sharpens his knife.
Goodbye, Sir Jack.
Look, you're a ghost. I'm an American.
It would never work out.
Sweet Mother Mary, Saint Colum...
- I don't want you to get murdered again.
- Saint Bridget...
- It's just that my wife...
- Please release me.
- Please protect me, Mary.
- ...if she found out, she'd murder me!
Oh, Jack, is that you?
God, I don't know what happened to me but I feel zonked.
I've got pains all over my body.
Could you rub my back?
Well, go on, Jack. I won't bite.
Oh, Jack, you never did it like that before.
Oh, Saint Patrick.
Oh, Saint Jude!
Oh, Saint Columcille.
- Oh, Shitehawks McGoldrick!
- Jack!
- Sharon? Sharon?
- Jack! Jack!
- Honey! What...? What's up?
- Jack! Jack!
Honey, honey, honey, what? What is it?
Where have you been?
There was a man in my bathtub!
Big giant man, gigantic.
And he's rubbing my back and it felt good.
I should have known it wasn't you!
He had warts all over his hands...
Oh, yeah, right. He had warts.
Yeah, that's Martin.
- Who's Martin?
- He's a ghost.
- He's a what?
- He's a ghost.
- He murders his wife every night.
- Jack...
Other than that, I think he's pretty harmless, sweetheart.
- Get out! Out!
- Honey...
- Jack, out!
- Sweetheart, look, honey...
- Honey, wait, you don't understand!
- Out, out!
Honey, we've got to talk.
Are you okay, honey?
Do I look okay?
Not really.
What are you doing?
Have to check this place out.
Something smells very wrong here.
Yes, it does.
It smells like burnt rubber.
Yeah. Yeah, that's me.
To right. Right to left.
Left to right. Right to left.
- Do you believe this?
- Only four channels!
- The cables must be unplugged.
- There's no cable. This is it.
- I tell you, this place sucks the big one.
- So, fingers together...
Wendy!
Left to right. Right to left.
You horrible little children!
Eternity's a big commitment.
You know, it's a long time.
You gotta take things one step at a time. That's the key.
You do love her, don't you?
Yeah, I guess I do. I don't know, I...
What's the problem, then?
She's a ghost! She's dead. I'm alive.
- How do you know all this?
- I'm married to one.
Won't you join us... for a drink?
Yeah, I could use a drink. Yeah, sure.
Oh, dear Lord...
I do beseech thee to help me in this, my hour of need.
Oh, cleanse me of these impure thoughts
I have for this woman, Miranda.
Come on!
Oh, Lord! I get the message!
Brother Tony?
Brother Tony?
Brother Tony, are you all right?
Brother Tony?
Brother Tony, what are you doing in the pool?
The Lord works in mysterious ways.
True love can move mountains.
Yeah, but it can't bring the dead back to life.
Oh, yes, it can. On Allhallow's Eve.
- Halloween? That's tomorrow night.
- Yes.
When the spirit moves and the flesh is willing... and the juices flow and the skelping is mighty.
- What's "skelping"?
- It's a ghost term.
But it's dangerous.
You mustn't go too far.
What do you mean?
Oh, it's you.
- Whom were you expecting?
- Come on, Mr. Plunkett.
Those fake ghosts were one thing.
This is entirely different, isn't it?
- Is there something wrong with your rooms?
- Something wrong with our rooms?
- What are you talking about, ghosts?
- Well, the brochure did...
Damn the brochure!
We're talking real, live spirits here!
- How do you explain this?
- The weather.
Oh, come off it, will you?
Don't you understand? He wants us here.
He knows it's the only way he can keep this dump.
I don't know about the rest of you but,
Plunkett, you haven't fooled me at all.
- I... I've been fooled.
- Oh, me, too.
- I've been very fooled.
- Explain this to me.
"A ghost may not tup with a human."
So, this means a ghost cannot make love with a human being.
Oh, my God!
Mary?
Who's Mary?
- Oh, she...
- Who's this Mary?
She's a woman. She's a ghost.
- Jack, don't start this ghost stuff again.
- No, she's a woman ghost.
- She's someone I care about and...
- What?
It's funny how you can care...
I think I'm falling...
Jack, don't stand there and tell me that you're having an affair with a goddamn ghost.
- Wait a minute, give me a chance!
- No, that's it! Your lawyer, my lawyer!
And I hope the ghost has a lawyer because I want to meet him!
- Here she is, this is Mary.
- No, Martin!
- This is Mary, Mary the ghost.
- So, you wee harlot!
- No, Martin, no!
- Not tup with me, eh?
- That's Martin.
- That's the man that was in my bathtub.
That's Martin the ghost.
Yeah, and see, he's gonna come over, he's gonna throw her on the bed here.
- He's gigantic.
- That's Martin the ghost.
They're having problems in their relationship.
No, Jack, we're having problems in our relationship.
- Come here!
- Honey, you got to see this.
- Come on.
- He's gonna run after her.
- Just come over here for a second.
- Where is he? Where is he?
Martin, there's no one! There's no one!
Oh, yes, there is, my husband.
There's my husband!
Martin, there's no one!
- Why don't I believe you?
- Believe this!
Honey, honey, you can't just kick a ghost.
- Did you see that?
- Oh, now look what you did.
Mary. Mary. Wait. Wait, Mary.
- I love you.
- I know that.
You do?
When did you know that?
The minute I saw you.
The minute I knew I loved you.
But your love must be true.
- It is.
- Silt must withstand all obstacles.
It will. It will.
Oh, Mary, my darling.
What have I done to you?
What have I done?
That was a dirty trick, wasn't it, hey?
Hey? Kicking me right in the bahookies.
Well, you were gonna stab your wife with a sword, you pig!
Sure, that's no big thing.
I do it every night.
And I suppose watching other men's wives in the bathtub is no big deal, either.
Sure, it's a grand thing if the wife happens to be you.
- You dirty peeping Tom.
- My name is not Tom, it's Martin!
Oh, Mary.
Oh, Mary, I'm sorry, darling.
What have I done to you?
What have I done?
Oh, God. Oh, God. Here, give us a wee skelp before I vanish.
No, no, no, not again.
Jeez, you're a way wee vixen, aren't you?
Oh, Lord, what have I done?
Oh, God, what have I done?
Oh, God, what a woman!
You're not so bad yourself.
- What's skelping?
- Skelping?
This is skelping.
- That's nasty.
- 'Twasn't nice?
Oh, it was nice.
It was very, very, very, very nice.
Hold on, Mary. Wait a minute.
You can't just skelp me and leave me.
Can't help it.
Skelping takes a lot out of you.
Look, Mary, I...
I'll be in the chamber, midnight tomorrow.
Mary.
So, what's wrong with them, eh?
What's wrong with these Americans?
One night they're desperate to leave, the next night you can't get rid of them.
One day they hate the whiting, the next day they have to have all five courses.
When you break your back to give them the ghosts you thought they wanted... they scream at you.
And when you throw the towel in, they scream even louder.
They see spooks everywhere.
Spooks in the bathroom, spooks under the bed.
Don't they know when the joke is over?
How they cower at nothing.
What is going on here?
Eamon, why are chunks of masonry floating about?
Mr...
Mr. Plunkett...
I think there's some people want to have a word with you.
Who?
Grand Uncle Peter and Grand Aunt Nan.
Granny Joyce and her sister.
- Half-sister.
- Her half-sister.
- Not to mention...
- Oh, no. No, no.
- Your daddy.
- But he's dead!
I know.
He looks terrible angry, too.
And I've a perfect right to be... considering what you have done to our ancestral home!
Father!
Let us in! Let us in!
Do you really think you could get away from me?
Leave me alone. You're dead.
Not so dead I can't see what a numbskull you are!
Oh, fine!
Call me names. That's so easy.
- Well, for God's sake, look at you!
- What did you have to give me this place for?
You knew I was an incompetent.
All I wanted to be was happily useless.
You made me miserably useless giving me this place.
Staff to run, bills to be paid.
And then dying on me just like that!
Most people give some warning, you know.
Premature senility, angina, gout, bedridden for years.
But not you. Oh, no, no, no.
Healthy as an old goat... you pop off one day in the orchard, and what then?
Not a goddamn word, not a whisper.
Did it never occur to you that I might need some advice?
That I might miss you?
Oh, Peter, I never thought that...
It's true, you old ghost.
I missed you, Daddy.
Give your daddy a hug.
Oh. Sorry, Peter.
They will be back tonight.
It is Allhallow's Eve.
So, if you see anything, just ignore it, ignore it completely.
Just pretend that it didn't happen.
Have you got that?
I don't hear anything. Do you?
No. No.
Don't you just love whiting?
Madam.
Madam, for you I've missed my wedding for the first time in years.
That's how much I want you.
Actually, I know I'm a ghost and a murderer, but forget about all that.
Listen, tonight's Allhallow's Eve... the one night in the year that I turn to flesh.
So, what do you say to a wee bit of skelping, eh?
Come on.
At least tell me your name.
Wow!
Oh, lady, I've got the best bahookies from here to Ballinderry.
Come on, what do you say?
Let's give it a twirl, eh?
- Drop dead.
- Oh, God, what a woman!
"He who tups with the spirit finds only the grave.
But the virtuous heart true love will save."
"He who tups with the spirit finds only the grave.
But the virtuous heart true love will save."
A whiskey over here, please. A whiskey.
Forget that. Relax, everybody.
Take it easy.
They won't come into a bar, would they?
They don't drink whiskey.
- Who?
- Spirits.
How the hell would I know?
- The Irish ones do.
- He says the Irish ones do.
- Don't.
- Now, what, do they or don't they?
- You don't shagging know, do you?
- Look! Look!
It may be no more than a local disturbance in the extra-planar ether.
- Ether, me bollocks.
- A supernatural belch, you know what I mean?
- Dad!
- Dad!
Davey, drinks all around!
- What's that?
- Ignore it! No!
- Where's your ectoplism now?
- What?
- Now, what in the name of God is that?
- Look, Dad, it's a submarine!
- Look, it's moving!
- What is that?
Well, what's the shagging thing on top of it?
It's a giant squid!
"Yea, though I walk through the valley of death, I shall fear no evil."
Mom!
Woody!
"Thy rod and thy staff, they will comfort me."
Woody!
- Woody!
- Save the child!
Woody!
Hold on!
Woody, hold on!
Heave!
Heave!
Woody!
Mom! Mom! Mom!
Mom!
- Mom!
- Look! Hey, look! Oh, look.
She's moving on!
Be moving on.
It's a bloody good thing we ignored it, huh?
Hello.
Hello.
Oh, God, you're real!
- Having fun?
- Fun?
- It's gotten totally out of control here!
- I'm afraid I've been with my family.
Is the roof leaking?
- You have no idea what it was like.
- It was worse than flying, sir.
No.
- Did we just tup?
- No, but it's not too far off.
Right. Right.
Hey, how about some champagne, huh?
A little champagne to get our mind off the old you-know-what.
All right?
Oh, I usually mess this up.
"Drink to me only with thine eyes and I will pledge with mine
Or leave a kiss within the cup and I'll not ask for wine"
That was so beautiful.
- Who wrote it?
- Ben Jonson.
Oh, Ben Jonson.
You know, whenever I hear Ben's material... it just makes me think about you-know-what.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I apologize.
- Quote me something.
- Quote?
- Anything. To keep our minds off...
- You-know-what.
Right. A quote.
"There ain't nothing in the world like a big-eyed girl
To make me act so funny
Make me spend my money
Makes me feel real loose like a long-necked goose
"Oh, baby, that's what I like"
That's so...
- Who wrote that?
- The Big Bopper.
Maybe you know him. He's dead, too.
Are you sure they're gone?
- Everyone, stay behind me.
- What?
- Stay behind him.
- We have to check this place out.
- Never seen a parapsychologist at work before.
- Every inch of it.
- The castle, grounds...
- It's kind of scary down...
Quiet!
I doubt it will work with the Plunkett ancestors.
- Got to try. Check outside.
- They're rather unapproachable.
Go on in.
Quiet.
- Oh, Sir Jack, I'm in me cups.
- No.
It's nothing. I'm really drunk.
- No, we mustn't.
- Right.
- We should just be friends.
- Yeah.
Go!
Halt!
- Go!
- How beautiful the night looks!
I'm having the time of my life!
Keep it down...
Isn't it beautiful?
Not as beautiful as you.
Will you hold it down and listen to the paracyclist?
I formally declare this a spirit-free zone!
- Now, I'm not tupping.
- No.
I'm not tupping, right?
I mean, this is somewhere between a skelp and a tup, right?
Holy God, that's my shagging bus!
- This shouldn't be happening.
- Not again.
Somebody's blowing it here.
Where's Jack?
Sharon.
My darling, Sharon!
- No, Jack.
- Okay.
- We mustn't.
- Okay.
- I can't.
- You can't?
- It's not right.
- I know, I know.
- Oh, that's nice.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
I mean, no. Stop.
- Stop.
- Oh, don't listen to me, Jack.
- Go on.
- Go on?
Sharon, I love thee!
And tonight's bahookie night!
Oh, Sharon, I love thee!
No, Jack. Remember our promise?
Remember? We can't.
A little to the right.
Come here, my wee beauty.
Come here to me!
Where are you?
Oh, Sharon. Wait! Wait! Wait!
- I love you, Jack.
- I love you, Mary.
Actually, you look very like my mother.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
Oh, Lord, please save this beautiful creature from these demons.
If a life must be taken, take mine.
Take mine.
- Take... Yes.
- Oh, no.
"Yea, though I walk through...
- the valley of the shadow of death."
- Brother Tony!
- Goodbye, my love.
- Where are you going?
- "I shall fear no evil, for thou art with me."
- Don't leave me here, Tony!
My God, Jack, we shouldn't have.
Mary, that was something.
Where are you?
Sharon, this isn't a joke anymore.
Shitehawks McGoldrick Quinn!
Mary, what's happened?
It's the powers, Jack.
I'm 200 years old.
Oh, Jack...
Jack...
"He who tups with the spirit tups with the grave."
- Jack, don't leave me, Jack.
- Mary.
Help me!
Oh, Jack!
Jack.
Jack, you just tell me you love me.
- Make it all right.
- But you're not Mary. You're a corpse!
- Jack!
- Now, don't do this to me, darling!
No! Get away from me!
- Jack!
- Oh, bollocks!
Holy Jesus!
- Hi, Marty.
- Where's the wife?
- Not mine, you dolt, yours!
- Jack...
I'm being followed by a UFO!
- Honey, it was...
- Sharon! Sharon! You can't get so excited!
- I didn't know what was going on!
- Excited?
- I mean, obviously...
- Come here to me, you wee tupter!
Hiya, Mary. We're just playing around, darling, you know?
Jack?
You threw me over for this? This...
I mean, I knew you liked passive women,
Jack, but she's half-dead.
I hope she has a great personality because this hurts.
- Well, look, at least she said she loved me.
- This really hurts.
- That's a lot more than you ever did.
- I do love you, Jack. I do.
You wee harlot, I'll kill you.
- Oh, no! Oh, no!
- I'll kill you!
No, she looks dead enough already.
Don't start that! Please don't start that!
It's all right, Sharon.
- Oh, Jack, your wife's some woman.
- So is yours.
So was yours.
- Oh, Sharon.
- Oh, Martin.
Where are you going?
Jack.
Jack, I was just kidding.
You were made for each other...
- and you look great, you really do.
- It's bahookie time.
Jack...
Bye, Mary.
Sorry for the last 200 years, darling.
Jack, you said you'd love me forever.
I know. I know. I know, Mary, I just...
You were... You were so different then.
Only on the outside, Jack.
Inside, I'm the same.
I know. I know looks aren't everything.
- I'm in here, Jack.
- It's just that they can help so much...
- when you...
- Jack, kiss me.
Kiss you?
- Maybe we should get some moisturizer.
- Kiss me, Jack.
Or some medical supervision or something.
Please, Jack.
Stop, let me catch my breath.
Martin, where are you?
Martin, wait! Don't go!
- Sharon! Sharon!
- How the hell did you get up there?
No, no! Don't go, Martin!
No, wait! Wait!
Sharon!
I'm in here, love!
Martin, where are you?
- Oh, Martin.
- Oh, Sharon.
- You do love me, don't you?
- Oh, yes.
- You do love me, Sir Jack?
- Yeah.
Then look at me.
Well, then, be with me, be with me forever.
Any way you want it.
Sharon?
Mary. Mary!
Sharon...
Sharon.
Oh, Sharon... Oh, Sharon.
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
Oh, what have I... What have I done?
You weren't meant for this.
I don't want this to happen.
Oh, God...
Sharon...
Forever, Jack.
- You're alive.
- Aye.
- What do you mean I'm dead?
- Now, take my word for it.
Oh, you're just saying that so you can have your wicked way with me.
Sure, if you weren't dead, I wouldn't be able to have my way with you.
This is ridiculous.
You can't hide from me. I can find you.
- You can't fool me.
- They're gone.
- Here, file that.
- Malcolm!
- They're gone!
- They're not gone.
Brother Tony, you forgot your collar.
No, he didn't. He threw it away.
Didn't you, baby?
I'm only human.
Mr. Plunkett, single-handedly the worst vacation that I've ever experienced in my life.
- Thank you, Mr. Clay.
- However, I'll recommend Castle Plunkett... as the most haunted castle in the Western Hemisphere.
I hope that helps you with your business.
- You're too kind.
- I second that.
Most gracious.
- Bye!
- See you!
They're gone, dear.
Come on, Eamon.
I'll make you a nice fish sandwich.
I cannot thank you enough, Sir Jack, for deciding to stay.
Oh, hey, where am I gonna go, right?
And listen, Mary, when are you gonna stop calling me "sir"?
Sorry, I can't help it.
Well, maybe when you decide to marry me.
Are you asking?
Well, my wife's hardly dead, and it was such a horrible death.
Maybe we could wait a couple of centuries or...
- Oh, God.
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
We booked the hall till 12:00.
How about a little privacy?
The day is for the living, Jack.
The night is for the dead.
- How's the corpse?
- Pretty good.
- How's the psycho?
- Pussycat.
- So, was the trip worth it, Jack?
- Yeah. Yeah.
She thinks I'm brilliant.
Well, Mary, you put on a wee bit of flesh since I last saw you.
I'm not getting stabbed every night anymore.
- Mary, it hurt me more than it hurt you.
- Go on now with it.
So, how's the Yank?
- He takes me shopping.
- Come here to me.
My love. My reason for dying.
How'd she ever learn to dance like that?
Happiness, Sir Jack.
Yeah. Happiness.
Let me try and clarify some of this for you.
Best Company Supermarkets are not interested in selling wholesome foods.
They are not worried about the nation's health.
What is concerning them is that the nation appears to be getting worried about its health.
And that is what's worrying Best Co, because Best Co wants to go on selling them what it always has, ie, white breads, baked beans, canned foods and that suppurating, fat-squirting little heart attack traditionally known as the British sausage.
So, how can we help them with that?
Clearly, we are looking for a label.
We need a label brimming with health.
And everything from a nosh pot to a white sliced will wear one with pride.
And although I'm aware of the difficulties of coming to terms with this, it must be appreciated from the beginning that even the nosh pot must be low in something.
And if it isn't, it must be high in something else.
And that is its health-giving ingredient we will sell.
Which brings me to my final question.
Who are we trying to sell this to?
Answer, we are trying to sell this to the archetypal, average housewife, she who fills her basket.
What you have here is a 22-year-old pretty girl.
What you need is a taut slob, something on foot deodorisers in a brassière.
I... I'm not quite sure we can go along with that, Mr Bagley.
If you look at the market research...
I don't need to look at the market research.
I've lived with 13 and a half million housewives for 15 years.
I know everything about them.
She's 37 years old.
She has 2.3 children,
1.6 of which will be girls.
She uses 16 feet six inches of toilet tissue a week and fucks no more than 4.2 times a month.
She has seven radiators and is worried about her weight, which is why we have her on a diet.
And because we have her on a diet, we also encourage her to reward herself with little treats, and she deserves them.
Because anyone existing on 1,200 calories of artificial, synthetic, orange-flavoured waffle a day deserves a little treat.
"We know it's naughty, but you do deserve it.
"Go on, darling, swallow a bun."
And she does.
And the instant she does, the guilt cuts in.
So here we are again with our diet.
It's a vicious, but quite wonderful circle, and it adheres to only one rule.
"Whatever it is, sell it."
If you want to stay in advertising, by God, you'd better learn that.
Bagley. Look, it's not in my nature to be a pain in the arse with such consistency.
It's being forced on me.
I just had them on the phone.
They are phoning me back.
I've got to give them something.
- Tell them it'll be wonderful. Hi, Harry.
- All right?
I did. They're over the moon.
Apart from 15 calls a day wondering where the fuck it is, they couldn't be happier.
They're getting impatient. We promised them the animatic over a week ago.
I'll be frank with you, Bagley.
I'm running out of bullshit.
- Try massaging your temples.
- I've got to give them a date.
Either a date or you give me some idea of what you're coming up with.
I'm coming up with a brilliant advertisement for a very dull pimple cream.
Then why can't I take a look?
Why can't I see something?
You know, just a storyboard or some roughs, anything so as I can give them an idea of the direction you're going in.
No. I don't show work in progress.
- Any calls?
- Mr Bristol called again, twice.
- I hope you told him I was out.
- Yes, Mr Bagley. You were out.
- Good. If he calls again, I'm still out.
- Bagley, you have got to give me a date.
All right, try Monday on him.
And don't get so panicky.
Nobody ever remembers a late delivery,
Richard. They only remember a bad one.
Boil busters. The boil busters.
Your face can be a battleground.
You need something tough.
Jesus.
What do they want another pimple cream for?
The market's saturated.
There's a lot of boils out there, Bagley.
"Nobody cares as much about your skin as you do,
"but we do try.
"And because we care,
"we went to an expert -
"Mother Nature -
"and we discovered that sometimes, the most effective way
"of dealing with those troublesome little breakouts
"is Mother Nature's own richest source of Vitamin A.
"So we took essential oils
"of carrot, marigold seed...
"roots and other natural ingredients,
"and we packed this shit into every tube.
"We called it HP Megaventure.
"And if it doesn't work on your blackheads,
"you can spread the fucker on toast!"
Sorry to disturb you, Mr Bagley, but Mr Bristol's on the line again.
- Tell him I'm out again.
- He says he knows you're not.
He says he knows you're avoiding him and he says he insists on a time to see you.
Oh, for Christ's sake, give me a break.
All right, tell him this afternoon.
Four o'clock this afternoon.
- And get my wife on the phone.
- Yes, Mr Bagley.
"Hi. My name's Barbara Simmons,
"and I'm a biochemist.
"But at night, I'm a woman,
"and I want my skin to be at its best.
"So I recommend a new product.
"It's called...
"whatever the fuck it's called,
"and I use whatever the fuck it is
"because I know it works.
"And I should know,
"because I make it."
Mrs Bagley on line one.
What do you want!
Yes, I'm sorry, darling. I know I did.
Listen, I don't think
I'm gonna make it back tonight.
I'm gonna blitz it.
Oh, no, fine, fine. It's going fine.
It's just, the deadline's getting serious.
Really?
Well, we could meet for lunch, celebrate my breakthrough.
OK, one o'clock.
- You're chain-smoking, darling.
- I know I am. I know I am.
I'd like another vodka martini, dry as a bone, twist, no olive.
Spritzer, please.
I tell you, Julia, I'm out of my mind.
I'm getting nowhere. Zero.
Stop getting so wound up about it. It'll come.
And please put that cigarette out.
That's three in ten minutes.
Darling, why don't you forget it a minute?
Take the afternoon off.
- I can't. I've got to see Bristol.
- You're not gonna be much use.
Oh, that's where you're wrong, Julia.
That's what's so insane about all this.
Anything else, I'm fine.
Any other part of the human body,
I'll sell it something.
Give me a bald head, and I'll sell it shampoo.
- I cannot get a handle on the boils.
- Pass me the butter, please, darling.
The moment I think of a boil, my mind slips into a sort of dreadful, oily neutral.
I just sit there, hour after hour, chewing the ends off pencils, smoking myself daft.
- What exactly is this stuff?
- It's a standard.
16 to 26-year-old acne attacker.
It's a hexafluoride.
- Does it work?
- No idea. It's probably junk.
Well, that's probably the problem.
If you knew it actually got rid of boils, you'd have no problem selling it.
Nobody in advertising wants to get rid of boils, Julia.
They're good little money spinners.
All we want to do is offer hope of getting rid of them. And that's where I'm blocked!
- Where's our drinks?
- They're coming, sir.
Well, I really do think you should cancel Bristol and come home with me.
I can't. I've been cancelling him all week.
Why can't we cancel this dinner?
I'm not in the mood for that mob.
If I had known we were having dinner,
I'd never have suggested lunch.
We can have both. People do, darling.
- I suppose Wheelstock will be there.
- Don't take it out on Penny.
Christ, what am I going to do?
Dennis, for goodness' sake, stop getting so paranoid.
Everything will be all right. You've had these sort of problems many times before.
- Not like this, I haven't.
- Oh, yes you have.
You had a terrible time with piles.
I did not have a terrible time with piles.
I may have had a problem getting ahold of them,
- but selling them was a piece of cake.
- You're raising your voice.
Compared to this, piles were a birthday present.
- So was dandruff. So was breath.
- You're still raising your voice.
The whole lot taken together, including the fucking lawnmowers, is as nothing compared to the pimples, acne and boils!
I don't want to go back in there.
Don't worry about it.
Don't think about boils.
If a boil pops up, force yourself to think of something else.
- OK.
- And don't go near your office.
Just see Bristol and come home.
- Are you sure you can't wait for me?
- Sorry, I can't, darling.
Get Bristol on the line and tell him I'm coming in to see him now.
Yeah. Have him call me later.
Sorry to keep you waiting, Bagley.
I didn't expect you till four o'clock.
- Here, take a look at this.
- What is it?
It's a photostat of an arse from a copying machine.
- Don't recognise it, do you?
- Not offhand, no.
You gave the juniors a bit of a tongue-lashing yesterday.
- Really?
- Said you went over the top.
I haven't got time to give lessons in advertising.
They asked my opinion, and I gave it.
In my opinion, they'd completely missed the brief.
I think you're probably right.
Not now, Sheila.
As a matter of fact, I think you helped them out. About 15 minutes.
Anyway. That's not actually what I wanted to talk about.
How are we getting on with the pimple cream?
Five minutes.
Is it special? 555-0472.
- Sensational.
- Can you give me a verbal peek?
- You know me, John. I'd rather not.
- That's what I thought.
No, Los Angeles 555-0472.
I'm very pleased to hear it, because I'll tell you frankly, they were on the phone this morning, threatening to pull the account.
Anyone but you and they would.
It's finished. Just a fine-tune.
I'll be through over the weekend.
Can we diarise on that?
- Of course.
- Wonderful. Wonderful.
Yes. Put him through.
Mmm? Mm-hm.
Really? Why so fast?
Really?
What happened to Seymour,
Hickwash, Bone, Riddle and Gore?
Really?
What about OCDS?
Wh... Is it a kipper?
Oh, that's interesting.
What a complete range of dinners.
Frozen kippers...
Just hang on a second, Bagley.
No. He's here now. I'll ask him.
No, no, he's finished.
He'll be through Monday, for sure.
Hang on a sec, Eddie.
Can you handle a Monday pitch?
It's a quickie. You'd have to go in dry.
- What's the product?
- It's a boil-in-a-bag.
- You all right. Bagley?
- Yes, I'm fine.
Tell him OK. I'll be in first thing Monday morning.
You must stop worrying.
If a boil pops up, force yourself to think of something else.
You're absolutely right.
I'm absolutely not gonna think about boils, large boils, blind boils or fat girls' boils, till ten o'clock tomorrow morning.
What about large, blind, fat girls with boils?
I see the police have made another lightning raid.
- Paddington drug orgy.
- Huh.
I suppose young girls was involved?
"One discovered naked in the kitchen,
"breasts smeared with peanut butter.
"The police took away a bag containing
15 grams of cannabis resin.
"It may also contain a quantity of heroin."
Or a pork pie.
I beg your pardon?
I said, the bag may also have contained a pork pie.
I hardly see a pork pie's got anything to do with it.
All right, then, what about a large turnip?
It may also have contained a big turnip.
- The bag was full of drugs.
- Nonsense.
The bag was full of drugs! It says so!
The bag could have been full of anything.
Pork pies, turnips, oven parts.
- It's the oldest trick in the book.
- What book?
The distortion of truth by association book.
The word is "may".
You all believe heroin was in the bag because cannabis resin was in the bag.
The bag may have contained heroin, but the chances are 100 to one certain that it didn't.
Lot more likely than what you say.
About as likely as the tits spread with peanut butter.
- Do you mind?
- The tits were spread with peanut butter!
- Nonsense.
- It says so!
Who's the man you are to think you know more about it than the press?
I'm an expert on tits.
Tits and peanut butter.
I'm also an expert drug pusher.
- I've been pushing drugs for 20 years.
- Look here, I've had enough of this!
And I can tell you, a pusher protects his pitch.
We wanna sell 'em cigarettes and don't like competition, see?
So we associate a relatively innocuous drug with one that is extremely dangerous.
And the rags go along with it because they adore the dough from the ads.
I've had enough of this.
I'm getting off at Thatchet.
Getting off at Thatchet won't help you.
Getting off anywhere won't.
I've had an octopus squatting on my brain for a fortnight, and I suddenly see that
I am the only one that can help you.
It would be pointless to go into the reasons why, but I've been worried sick about boils for a fortnight.
Large boils, small boils, fast eruptors.
They're incurable, all of them.
I know that, and so does everybody else.
Until they get one.
Then the rules suddenly change.
With a boil on the nose, there's a sudden overnight surge in faith.
They wanna believe something will work.
He knows that, which is why he gets a good look in with the dying.
Sell some hope, you see?
But these boys would be full-time into real estate if anyone came up with a genuine cure for death!
Good God, this is a madman!
What do you know about God, you wire-haired Mick?
Here, have 'em. I've given up.
- What on earth are you doing?
- I'm reading a newspaper.
We're in the middle of a dinner party.
I'm sorry. I can't bear that great, pompous herbivore in there.
I'm sick of hearing about her soya proteins.
You might at least make a bit of an effort.
At least sit at the table.
Bring the cream.
- Both breasts and the leg removed?
- When all's said and done, it's perfectly obvious most girls love being on the pill.
What utter balls, Jonathan.
Do you think women like filling their bodies with chemicals?
- We're talking about eels, darling.
- Yes, it is most extraordinary.
Apparently, by the year 2000, the level of oestrogen in the sea will be as much as two parts per million.
So many women taking the pill, you see.
The problem is, it's starting to mess up the fish.
- They're breeding in the sea.
- I thought fish did.
Not eels, darling. Eels breed in rivers.
I think men should bleed.
What a disgusting thing to say!
You find bleeding disgusting, do you?
Not particularly.
Just the way you said it.
That horrible sneer and mouth full of nuts.
Darling, Penny is our guest.
Women, I might inform you, take that primitive device called the pill because it's all they've got.
They don't like it.
I personally abhor it.
But, unfortunately, it's all we've got.
- In what context?
- In the context of bed.
I'm surprised you need to bother.
Cointreau, anyone?
Darling, I know you're having a very difficult time at the moment, and I know you've had rather a lot to drink and didn't mean what you said.
But Penny is our guest and I'd like you to apologise.
He doesn't need to apologise. Those kinds of sexist attitudes are beyond apology.
What do you mean by that?
Do you really think I don't understand?
You dislike me because I'm not one of those starved little tarts you exploit.
I don't rush out and buy your latest makeup.
I have a mind of my own.
And I have a body of my own that doesn't fit into the preconceived patterns men like you dictate.
- You mean you're fat.
- Yes, I'm fat!
And you're perfectly at liberty to hate me for it.
You're quite wrong.
I don't dislike you because of that.
I wouldn't care if you were so huge we had to put up scaffolding to feed you.
Oh, for God's sake, let's not have a row.
- Why not? Why shouldn't we have a row?
- Because nobody wants one!
- You're being completely irrational.
- Irrational?
We're all prepared to sit here discussing mung beans and soya protein, but if anybody touches on anything real, it's irrational?
Right, then, you're being rude.
Unutterably rude and a bore!
- Bagley, come and have a drink.
- I've had a drink, thank you.
Now I'm going to have another.
- Do you wear Y-fronts?
- Don't tell him.
I think you're contemptible.
And I think you are a vegan who eats meat in secret.
- See? She's a meat-eating vegan.
- I do not eat meat!
But you'll eat fish till the cows come home.
- Don't argue with him.
- Fish is allowed!
Including eels? Eels full of oestrogen?
If it's buggering the eels, think what it's doing to you.
- Get back to your fig bottling!
- You're going out of control.
Oh, no, I'm not.
I'm just beginning to see the light.
- You're talking nonsense.
- It's all so clear.
I've been living a nightmare, obsessed with other people's acne, wracking my brains to be original about boils.
I've been going berserk!
But then I suddenly thought of a pork pie.
- Get his Valium.
- I tell you, it was like a fucking brainwave!
I have discovered that brains are being laundered daily.
I have found that out, but it shall be no more!
Jesus Christ!
What do you think you're doing?
I'm completing a process of natural selection.
I'm going through everything in the house and isolating items of genuine worth.
All other products, especially those contaminated with advertising,
I am disposing of.
Have you gone out of your mind?
I know it's going to be difficult, but I'll explain properly and you will understand.
Dennis, listen to me.
You're under tremendous stress.
You were drunk last night, and probably don't realise it, but you were out of control.
Maybe I was, but now I've had time to work things out, get everything in perspective.
Darling, can't you see what you're doing this morning is equally out of control?
Oh, no, you're quite wrong, Julia.
There's nothing out of control about me now.
I know exactly what I'm doing now.
God in heaven!
The sweet stench of revenge!
Please stop that. I think you're ill.
I'm gonna do those bastard television sets in here.
- Like you're doing the vacuum cleaner?
- That's right.
Except I'm gonna do them better.
I'm gonna turn them on and do them in the middle of an advertisement for themselves.
- I'm going to drown them.
- You call that rational, do you?
Certainly. Everything I do is rational.
Why have you put chickens down the lavatory?
To thaw them before dismemberment.
You're ill, darling.
I want you to get out of the bath.
They feed 'em on fish, they taste like fish, so I shall dismember them and return them via the sewers to the sea.
Get out of the bloody bath!
I know this must be all sort of upsetting for you, darling, but honestly, I assure you of its necessity.
- It has to be done or we'll never be free.
- From what?
What sort of freedom can you get from hacking a vacuum cleaner to pieces?
Look at you! You've got a polythene bag on your head. You look stark raving mad.
You need help. You need rest.
This cursed pimple cream has got on top of you.
Which is why I intend to escape.
You're not escaping it.
You're encouraging it.
- You're suffering them yourself.
- What do you mean?
You're so run down, you've got a boil yourself.
- Me?
- Yes.
A horrid looking boil, spouting from your neck.
You never had a boil before in your life.
You're totally worn out, both physically and emotionally.
My God, you're right!
I've got a boil.
Sullivan Bristol. One moment.
I'm gonna collect something from my office.
While I'm there, get hold of Bristol and tell him I'm coming to see him.
- Mr Bristol's out. Sullivan Bristol.
- I want a call the moment he turns up.
And get me a couple of dispatch boys.
I need some equipment moved.
Ow!
I've come to give you a present.
How nice.
To me, this represents everything that is wrong and everything that is vile with this profession.
- Really?
- It is the reason I'm resigning.
- What's suddenly upset you about it?
- The hypocrisy it represents.
- It was never used.
- Not its. Mine.
I believed in it, and I sat back like some gagged little idiot while they buggered it.
- I should have resigned then.
- I see.
I don't approve of its rejection.
I can no longer tolerate it.
I don't approve of Her Majesty's
Government's cynical little bit of twaddle that smoking can seriously damage your health as any kind of acceptable alternative.
I wouldn't have thought anyone was arguing about that.
Precisely. Nobody's arguing about it, especially the government.
The only fucker this ever frightened was the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
But I'm going to argue about it.
I'm going to shout about it!
- I wouldn't do that, old chap.
- Can damage your health?
What's "can" got to do with it?
Can, could, might, possibly, maybe.
"Does" is the word we want to hear.
The bastards are killing 100,000 a year.
Warning by Her Majesty's Government.
"This product contains highly toxic carcinogenic poisons.
"Avoid all contact. Do not inhale.
"Should inhalation occur, seek immediate advice from a physician."
I saw Harry yesterday. He said you were having problems with the pimple cream.
Did he? Well, he's wrong.
Because I have eradicated the pimple cream from my life.
He also said you lost your temper with some photographs.
That's right. Closeups of hives.
Don't you think the way you reacted could be considered a little irrational?
Don't start the old irrational bollocks with me, Bristol!
I'm up to here with it. I know everything there is to know about rationality, and I know everything there is to know about advertising.
- Hold them, Sheila.
- So don't tell me I'm being irrational.
Because I'm the man who's taken the stench out of everything but shit.
OK, old chap, why don't you take some time off?
What the fuck do you think
I'm resigning for?
I'm taking forever off.
I'm going to cleanse my life.
I'm going to rid my mind and body of poisons, and when I've done it, I intend to make it my life's work to encourage others to do it.
- And how will you do that?
- By telling them, you bald fool.
Walking up and down with a sandwich board?
- If necessary.
- Advertising, dear boy.
How dare you! How...
Aagh!
- What's the matter, Bagley?
- I've got a boil.
A big boil. I believe it's justice.
The poison quitting my miserable system.
15 years ago, I was out there on the floor where you are now, and I was very like you, Bagley.
I was the best.
But I got myself into some trouble with a gas-fired heating system.
I tell you, I was desperate.
I made myself ill with worry.
I finally ended up at a specialist who told me I'd given myself an ulcer.
But it was a lot more than that to me.
As far as I was concerned,
I'd given myself a detonator.
I became obsessed with fears of spontaneous combustion.
This gas-fired business had penetrated so deeply into my subconscious,
I thought I was seconds away from bursting into flames.
I started drinking water, sometimes as much as 25 pints a day.
I slept with a bucketful by the bed.
I even bought a fire extinguisher.
I'm surprised you needed to bother.
You must have pissed like a fire engine.
Anyway, what's all this got to do with me?
What I'm telling you is that I tried to quit too, but the man who sat here refused to accept my resignation.
- Hard luck.
- Was it?
I took a month off and went abroad, rested and got myself a tan and then I came back.
And by Christ, Bagley, did I sell some radiators.
- Really?
- Never been better.
And I'll tell you something else.
I didn't burst into flames, either.
Well, let's hope it's not too late.
Cos if you went up, it would save me a job.
Cos I tell you, Bristol, any night now,
I'm likely to turn up here and burn this dump to the ground.
I can't believe how the thing could grow so quickly.
This morning it was a pea.
Now it's like a fucking tomato.
I can't bear it any longer, Julia.
The bastard's on fire!
Bathe it in warm water again.
I have bathed it in warm water again.
I've washed it, dried it, poked it, agitated it, insulted it.
Nothing. All it does is throb and get bigger.
It's like a thing in a medical magazine.
- Hasn't the mustard helped?
- Of course not.
- Maybe you should try the English.
- This is the English.
No, it's not, darling.
It's Dijon with fine herbs.
Why don't you take some aspirin?
Never! I'm gonna knife the swine!
Calm down! It's just a big boil.
First thing in the morning, I'll run you into town and we'll have it looked at.
Now come to bed.
Julia... it's just grown a hair.
Oh, it's two o'clock in the morning!
Will you please come to bed?
Not now.
I gotta get down there and do some work.
Come on, race!
Come on. He needs some help.
What are we gonna tell him?
All we gotta do is tell him to throw a rock through their window.
Then knock on the door and sell them all a burglar alarm.
- Right.
- Oh, this is a good idea.
- Mwah!
- Oh, you missed me!
I'm going again.
- Oh! Ready? Mwah!
- Mm... Mwah!
Oh, I think you're wonderful.
Shall I follow you?
Yeah. Come on, let's hit this cathode ray tube.
OK. Ready? Here I go! Whee!
And whee!
Hiya, handsome.
You can go home, Mrs Wallace.
Dr Gatty, please. Julia Bagley.
Well, can you page him?
I need him at once!
Good. Yes, wonderful.
Thank you. Thank you.
The boil! The boil!
It's alive! It lives!
- What do you mean?
- It's grown a head!
I looked at it in the bathroom mirror, and it spoke to me!
Aah! Have a look at it!
- I have, darling.
- What's it doing?
Nothing. It's just a big boil.
Boils don't have ears!
Boils don't have mouths that smile!
No, darling. Neither does yours.
I promise you, it's all part of this silly, silly stress you're going through.
Come along.
We'll go and look at it together.
I don't think I dare.
Shall I tell you what happened?
You were dreaming. You dreamt you woke up and went to the bathroom.
You may have even slept walked there.
You saw your own face in the mirror, and it frightened you.
Things like that are always happening when people are under dreadful mental stress.
- Do you think so?
- I'm certain of it.
That'll be Dr Gatty.
Come upstairs and put something on.
- What's the problem, Julia?
- Dennis thinks he's got a talking boil.
- What?
- I can't go into it now, but he's manic.
- Where is he?
- Upstairs.
How is this manifesting?
Dennis, darling! Dennis!
Dennis, come back! Stop!
Ah! Come on, boy.
Come on, Dennis. I'm not gonna hurt you.
Stay back, Gatty!
You blast it on the radio!
- All right. Here you are. Now, now, boy.
- Aah! Aah!
- Now, now, now. Come on.
- Aah! Aah!
There, there, there.
There. All done. All done.
How do you think he'd react to a suggestion of psychoanalysis, Julia?
Well, he'll agree. He'll have to.
Not necessarily. He's almost certainly convinced of his sanity.
In which case, it might well be difficult to persuade him a psychiatrist could help.
The only thing he'd consent to at the moment is me lancing the boil.
Why don't you?
Do it now while he's asleep?
I'm not an expert in these things, Julia.
I don't think that's a good idea.
Removing it in his condition might set up some kind of permanent block.
You've got to remember, as far as he's concerned, I wouldn't be lancing it.
I'd be decapitating it, and that could be dangerous.
We don't know who this person is.
It might be a relative. His mother.
- I think it's a male.
- Father, then.
I'm sure that before any attempt is made to get rid of it, you've got to find out who it is.
Once we've done that, we've got a good chance of converting it back to a normal boil.
Then I'll lance it.
For the moment, it's just a matter of getting him to see a good psychoanalyst.
- Do you know someone?
- I know a very good man in town.
- It might take two or three days.
- He'll have to consent.
- If he doesn't, we'll have to make him.
- I fear so.
- What do you mean?
- Could involve certification.
But he's just exhausted.
He's not really mad, is he?
Running naked around a garden insisting a boil has spoken to you is more than just exhaustion, Julia.
Look. This is what I suggest. Tomorrow,
I'll call you with an appointment.
You have to do your best to get him there.
For the moment, make sure he keeps taking the tablets every two hours.
He'll stay under control.
When he wakes up, try and be normal.
Cook him dinner.
You'll probably have to go along with him.
It'll be difficult. You'll have to try.
And you'd better keep a record of what the boil says.
At least, what he says it says.
Could be important.
Don't worry. We'll sort it out.
- What are those?
- Just pills.
Two now, two before bed.
Do you think I'm going mad, Julia?
Goodness gracious, no!
Dr Gatty says you're simply paying the price of your creativity.
He says you have such an active imagination, it's taking advantage of you.
- What did he say about the boil?
- He said it's perfectly normal.
He said it's an absolutely normal boil, and as soon as you've had a proper rest, it'll go away.
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.
Trust me. Take my word for it.
Mmm. Smells good.
- Smells thumb-sucking good.
- Thank you, darling.
- I didn't say anything.
- Oh, I see.
Now we're going to have a nice dinner, and everything will be normal.
And if it speaks again, we'll ignore it, won't we?
Promise?
- What are you doing?
- Merely whistling.
- You're staring.
- Not at all.
I was just getting ready to clear my throat, that's all.
It's extraordinary how much steam comes off hot peas, isn't it?
Yes, darling.
Go to France.
Yes, fancy France?
Paris in the springtime?
That'd be lovely.
That's a very attractive oven glove.
Are you ashamed of your false teeth?
- I don't have false teeth.
- I know you don't, darling. I know you don't.
What I meant was, if you did have false teeth, would you be ashamed of them?
- It was a hypothetical question.
- Probably not.
Boeuf bourguignon.
Breath. For many, the unmentionable.
- I beg your pardon, darling?
- Just happened to be thinking about it.
Breath and false teeth and things.
You know, there's no real reason why we should wait.
- For what?
- Paris.
We could leave in a week or so.
- We could even leave tomorrow.
- You dropped your napkin, darling.
I'll buy a couple of polo necks, and we could hop on a plane.
Put an end to the misery of dentures.
You could smile again with confidence.
Just ask Barbara Simmons.
Why did you say that?
Who is Barbara Simmons?
I don't know.
- Then why talk about her?
- I don't know.
- You're not really trying, you know.
- Trying what?
Trying not to talk about breath and false teeth and people with names like Barbara Simmons.
I am, Julia.
It's got nothing to do with me.
It's the you-know-what.
Well, it's ever so slightly getting on my nerves.
- I thought we weren't going to listen to it.
- I can't help but listen to it.
And I can't stop the you-know-what saying it.
Stop saying "the you-know-what".
All right, then. The boil.
Darling, it is not the boil.
Don't you think I haven't noticed?
Every time you say something, you turn away or hunch your shoulder or get under the table so I can't see your lips moving.
That's not the case, Julia.
I'm not turning away to speak.
What it's doing is waiting till I turn away before it speaks.
That's nonsense!
It was you that suggested France.
I did not, I merely confirmed what the boil said.
- Then stop siding with it!
- Don't be ridiculous! I'm not siding with it!
I'm going crazy trying to incorporate it into my conversation so I won't upset you.
But I never know what it's going to say next.
What you'll say next.
It's you saying it.
It's the boil, Julia!
Believe me, it's the boil!
- I can't stand it any more.
- How do you think I feel about it?
I'm on the coast of panic.
I'm staring over the edge!
Just tell me how a boil can come up with a name like Barbara Simmons?
Say no more, Julia. Don't say more.
Why should a boil suddenly suggest going to France?
- I don't know.
- Why not Portugal?
I don't know. I don't know!
Perhaps the fucker wants to go up the Eiffel Tower!
Maybe the bastard wants to see the sights!
Sit down! I'm going to call Gatty.
- What for?
- To see if he's got you in!
In where?
- Stay back! You need help!
- I refuse to have that quack in here.
I refuse to be rendered unconscious.
You have got to see a psychiatrist.
Are you there, Julia?
Are you there?
I have to be very quiet.
He's a very light sleeper.
I wish I could come out and talk to you, darling.
But it's impossible. You've seen.
I have to tell you, Julia,
I'm getting increasingly concerned for my future.
I don't know how this will end.
For all I know, in a fortnight's time,
I'll be waking up with a bald head and a bit of a grin.
"How do you feel, Mr Bagley?"
"Much better, thank you, doctor."
But the one thing I'm not, darling, is insane.
I'm 100 percent normal.
When I came in here, it was my intention to make a film.
I wanted to tell the world about advertising.
It's not finished, of course.
It's difficult to concentrate with a shanker yacking on your neck.
Incidentally, in case it's bothering you, the reason I'm wearing this wine carton on my head is so I can talk without disturbing it.
It can't hear, you see?
The world is in danger, Julia.
The greed is out of control.
Greed is abolishing the future.
It's turning truth inside out and upside down.
And this is its poisonous mouthpiece.
Bollocks!
Oh, Christ! I think I've woken him up.
I'll have to be quick.
What I have to explain is the mechanics of a holocaust.
Oh, dear, oh, dear.
I'm not talking about atom bombs, darling. I'm talking about hamburgers.
I had a nasty feeling I was going to have to wake up to this.
If I was you, I'd turn this off, Julia.
It's only gonna upset you.
You see what a nightmare I'm in.
You see why I can't talk to you.
Who are you talking to, then?
God, it converses. I'm talking to it.
- I need a cigarette.
- Be silent, you Moloch!
- Moloch?
- Yes, that's you, you Moloch, you bogey!
If you insist we have to listen to this bullshit, I need a cigarette.
All right, I'll get you one.
But on one condition.
That you'll keep quiet while you're smoking it.
- Deal.
- Swear!
I might be a shanker, but my word is my bond.
Don't turn off, darling.
60 seconds and I'll be back.
Oh, Mrs Wallace!
I didn't know you were here.
- I thought everyone was out.
- My husband's outside in the van.
- Is he? How is he?
- He's waiting to collect me.
Is he? Julia out shopping?
Look, I wasn't actually going through your handbag. I need a cigarette.
Here, you can have them all.
I only want one. I don't smoke.
Got a light?
Vile. I'm glad I've given up.
Morning, darling. Lovely day.
Is it? Traffic's appalling.
You wouldn't make me a cup of tea, would you, Sylvia?
- Tea, Dennis?
- No, thank you.
Don't pretend you haven't noticed my cardboard box, Julia, because I know you have.
And I know Mrs, Wallace,
God bless her, has noticed it too.
But there's a perfectly reasonable explanation, which I'm afraid I don't have time to go into now.
Matter of fact, I'm very busy now.
I better get back in there.
- Thanks for the cigarette, Mrs Wallace.
- I thought you'd given up.
I have. I'm not smoking it.
I'm just holding it.
- I'll be out later.
- Don't be too long.
We're leaving in less than an hour.
Who's gonna tell me about it, then?
You or the boil?
No, no. I think we should start again.
There's no side to any of this.
There is me. There is a boil.
The boil happens to be able to speak, but that doesn't qualify it to give an opinion.
It was me that decided to come here, not it.
You don't think the inclusion of the boil could perhaps help us?
No. I'm not interested in its opinions.
Even if it says something that might be of relevance?
I'm not interested in it, no matter what it says.
In my opinion, it should be lanced instantly.
It was the only reason
I agreed to come off the garage roof.
If it wants to join in, it can pay its own bill.
Come and lie down.
Please.
Tell me about advertising.
Now, you resigned from an important firm with a very highly paid job.
I'd like to know your reasons.
Well, at least try and give me an example of even one of those reasons.
All right. Reason one.
Advertising conspires with Big Brother.
And you're afraid of Big Brother?
Someone or something coming into your life and telling you what to do?
No. I'm not afraid of him. I'm one of the few who really understands him.
Oh?
The man who conceived of Big Brother never knew what was coming down the line.
Thought his filthy creation was gonna be watching us.
But it is us who watch it.
There's one in every living room.
The monstrous injustice of it is, we stare at it of our own free will.
So we could say, principally, that it's television that you blame?
We can say entirely it is the crooks who've infiltrated it that I blame.
They've moved in on the greatest means of communication since the wheel.
And now they've done it, their greed is insatiable.
They're cutting down jungles to breed hamburgers, turning the whole world into a car park.
They'd sell off the sea to satisfy the needs of their great god Greed.
They won't be satisfied, not till we're all squatting in one of its fucking hatchbacks on a motorway.
There isn't going to be anywhere left to go except in slow revolutions towards the crest of the next slag heap.
Do you have trouble in getting an erection?
- What?
- Can you get an erection?
- Yes!
- Masturbating much?
Constantly! I've got a talking boil on my neck!
What would you do?
What does this mean to you?
"Are you ashamed of your false teeth?
"Put an end to the miseries of dentures.
"You could smile again with confidence.
"Just ask Barbara Simmons."
The boil said it a few nights ago.
Sounds like a particularly crude voiceover.
- Voiceover?
- The voice that sells.
If you're selling perfume, it sounds like a lover.
If you're selling something inedible you want people to eat, it'll sound as stupid as they'll have to be to buy it.
In this case, it would sound like a dentist, someone in the know.
I see. So one could say that it's, erm, the voice of authority?
Like, erm...
Well, like a parent's voice, almost?
If you like.
Has the boil spoken this morning?
Yes, I had a row with it, and it got very heated when I refused to shave.
- Tell me about your parents.
- Not part of the plot.
As far as I know, they were completely normal.
- I come from a completely normal family.
- Tell him about your grandfather.
That was the boil. Ignore it.
I don't think we should do that.
It's the first time it's spoken in front of me, and it might be important.
It has nothing important to say. It is destructive, self-satisfied and abusive.
- You cun...
- You see? Don't listen.
Come on. Fair's fair.
You've had your say. Now I'll have mine.
Don't listen to it! Don't listen to it!
Why don't you tell me about your grandfather?
If you tell me, the boil might be quiet.
My grandfather was caught molesting a wallaby in a private zoo in 1919.
- A wallaby?
- May have been a kangaroo. I'm not sure.
- You mean sexually?
- Suppose so. He had his hand in its pouch.
- Fucked it, didn't he?
- He did not fuck it!
Just... just lie back.
- What happened to him?
- He pleaded insanity and got three months.
Does the authoritarian attitude they took with him upset you?
- No. He died before I was born.
- Do you sympathise with him?
If I had been stuck in a trench for three years,
- I might do something stupid myself.
- Like showing affection for an animal?
- He'd fuck one.
- Shut up!
Ask Barbara Simmons.
He'd fuck her as well.
Oh, my God. How could the boil have possibly known about my grandfather?
That means it can read my mind.
No, Mr Bagley, it does not.
We'll speak about that in a moment, when we've had a look at this boil.
What you mean is you want me to have a look at it. No.
What would you say if I said that you don't want to look at it because you're frightened of what you might see?
I'd say you'd be absolutely right.
Isn't that trying to pretend it doesn't exist?
Isn't that exactly what you're accusing everyone else of doing?
Now, we must reduce this guilt in two ways.
First, it must be physically reduced with surgery.
And secondly, we must reduce your punishing conscience by refusing to allow it to hide.
Once we get it out into the open, it'll be easier to fight.
And I'm certain that by the time your neck's healed, you'll be smiling at this problem and be back at work.
Never. No matter what you reduce,
I will never go back to advertising.
Perhaps. But now, let's have a look at this bully on your neck.
Just look at it in the mirror... and tell me what you see.
Oh, God in heaven!
It's grown a moustache!
Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.
- Yes.
- Yes?
- The bastard looks just like me!
What you must understand is that it's not the boil that can read you.
It is you, Mr Bagley, that can read the boil.
You can read it because it is you.
At least, a part of you.
The boil knows what you're thinking because you've projected some of you into it.
You've given it the side that you find intolerable, the bullying, aggressive, dictatorial side.
The side that sells toothpaste and soap.
You've decided that selling these things is a bad thing for you to do, and you are unable to accept the guilt for what you feel you've done.
Therefore, you've transmitted these qualities into the boil.
Perhaps, by doing this, you hope to escape your guilt.
But you've created a symbol of foul-mouthed authority instead.
Your very own Big Brother.
- Welcome back. My name's Debra.
- My head.
Come on. Let's sit you up straight.
Up we go. There we are.
- Have they done it?
- In the morning.
- You hungry?
- No.
I'll bring you something anyway.
There's beef burgers or fish fingers.
I can hardly move my arms.
I can hardly move anything.
Barbiturate.
They gave you a whopping dose.
You should have had the fish fingers.
Mouthwatering fillets of young cod, matey, in a crisp, golden batter, my mate.
Shut up. You never talk in front of people, so don't talk in front of me.
Suit yourself. Suit yourself.
Suit yourself.
Just thought you might be interested in a little light rabbit to while the time away.
Fuck me. What I wouldn't do for a cigarette.
- Who are you? What do you want?
- I am your better half.
- You're not!
- Mais oui, je suis.
A very expensive psychiatrist told you I was.
He did not!
You're just a dirty carbuncle.
There's no reason to raise your voice.
There's no reason why we shouldn't pass these last few hours together amicably.
- Be quiet.
- That wouldn't be fair.
I listened to you and all that Big Brother muck.
Don't mind telling you,
I was bored stiff.
I had absolutely nothing to do under there.
Except tend me moustache, of course.
'Ere, you know why I grew it?
Big Granddad.
How did you find out about my grandfather?
Walls have ears, Dennis.
I overheard Julia telling Gatty.
Nice pair of tits, Julia.
I believe you was unconscious at the time.
You bastard! I only have one wish, and that is that I could be awake to see you lanced.
I'd like to see the knife going in.
I'd like to see you suffer.
- A typically communist statement.
- I'm not a communist!
Yes, you are. You want to take everyone's car away.
I do not want to take anything from anyone.
I want to give them the choice of something better.
- Oh, yes? What?
- Trains.
Trains? Trains are no good.
They're old-fashioned.
- I hate trains. They're rotten.
- Only because they don't consume.
Only because they're already there and don't eat up more and more and more.
That's why you hate them.
That's why government hates them.
That's why they're old-fashioned and rotten.
- You commies don't half talk a lot of shit.
- Shut up! I'm not a communist!
I refuse to argue with a carbuncle.
- You are a communist.
- Fuck off!
That's very rude of you, Mr Bagley.
Nobody's forcing you to have supper.
I'm sorry. That wasn't directed at you.
- Lovely.
- Thought you'd change your mind.
That wasn't me. That was the boil.
I've heard all about your boil, Mr Bagley.
- Now, you tuck in and enjoy it.
- It's no good.
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't eat.
I can't move my arm.
Looks like you're doing fine to me.
Oh, my God! Nurse!
It's the boil shaking it!
- It's the boil! Aah! Aah!
- Mmm.
Aah! Ah!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Aah!
Oh, Jesus! Oh! Oh, my God!
He's got my hand! He's got my arm!
You think I'd let a little pipsqueak like you undermine society, ruin everything we've got?
Piss like you needs dealing with!
You're the enemy within!
Nurse! Nurse! Nurse! Nurse!
Do you think I could have a pillow?
Yes, of course.
Thank you, Debbie.
May I call you Debbie?
You're talking to the wrong head!
Sorry, dear. I get these nasty spasms.
Help! Help! Help! Help!
Shut up! I've had enough of you!
Mmph!
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
- Help! Help!
- Put some pressure on his arm.
No! No! It's the boil! Aah!
Don't you worry, old man.
You have a little sleep.
It'll all be over in the morning.
- Mm!
- Help! Help!
No!
No, don't! Don't lance the wrong... head...
John. Bagley. I want to see you.
No, no. Just a couple of fuses blew.
Stitches coming out in a week.
Listen, we've got to talk about this pimple cream.
Yeah, yeah, I know he has.
Forget the problems.
I'll take care of the problems.
They're gonna love waiting for it.
It's a massacre.
But I've gotta warn you, at first it might sound ridiculous.
It's radical and not without its risks, but I'm certain I can pull it off.
And what it is, is Lawrence of Arabia and a little town called Aqaba.
The last thing they expected was for Lawrence to come roaring across the desert and attack them from behind.
It seemed impossible.
And because it was impossible, all their defences faced the wrong way.
And that's how I want to sell this pimple cream.
I want to come in from behind, where they least expect me, just like Lawrence of Arabia.
Now. As I see it, we've gotta forget this for at least three months.
I estimate that as the very minimum we need to create the ravenous market I'm after.
- And how are you gonna do that?
- By glamorising boils.
- Glamorise them?
- That's right.
I want to make them fashionable.
I want to encourage every kid to take a pride in his breakouts.
I want to sell them the idea that boils are beautiful.
If I can do that, I can treble the market at a minimum.
That's absurd.
To sell atom bombs, you've got to sell fear.
If you want to sell this pimple cream, you've got to encourage pimples.
How?
People try and put us down
Talkin' about my generation
Just because we get around
Talkin' about my generation
Things they do look awful cold
Talkin' about my generation
I hope I die before I get old
Talkin' about my generation
This is my generation
This is my generation, baby
Why don't you all just fade away?
Talkin' about my generation
Don't try to dig what we all say
Talkin' about my generation
I'm not trying to cause a big sensation
Talkin' about my generation
I'm just talkin' about my generation
Talkin' about my generation
This is my generation
This is my generation
Talkin' about my generation
This is my generation
This is my generation, baby?
Talkin' about my...
Cut! Cut! One more, boys. Get it right.
- Open the doors.
- Gotta go, Bagley.
- Richard, are you free Saturday?
- Yeah.
Julia's putting a party together.
It's our anniversary.
If you like, we'd love you along.
Oh! What are you doing?
Wake up, man! We're in mortal peril!
- How'd it go?
- Terrific.
- She's gonna be terrific.
- The stitches.
Terrific. Didn't feel a thing.
Coming up to bed, darling?
Mm, in a minute. Just watching this.
- It's fascinating.
- What is it?
A thriller.
Don't be too long, because I'm practically dead.
I didn't know you'd invited Penny.
Of course I invited Penny. You'd better be nice to her, cos she's my friend.
Poor Penny. I'm surprised she'd come.
I suppose she does it out of some sort of social duty, like organising Dutch caps for the Hindus.
It's nearly eight. Hurry up.
There's just this little piece of neck here I need to kiss.
You're looking very summery, Penny.
Thank you.
It's a Meilleur, made in India.
Happy anniversary, darling.
Are you having an affair, Julia?
- No.
- Then what's up?
Oh, I don't know.
I'm just so wound up about Dennis, terrified his thing will start talking again.
- Well, it hasn't, has it?
- Not exactly.
But I had this terrible, terrible dream,
Penny, a nightmare,
- and I can't get it out of my head.
- Mrs Bagley, the musicians are here.
Tell them to come in, Sylvia, do whatever they like.
We can't talk here.
Come and have a drink.
It said Dennis wasn't my husband.
It said it was.
And it said it with this horrible sort of mouth.
It said Dennis is an incarnation of evil with a briefcase.
It kept going on about a briefcase.
Then it said, "Zero, zero, zero," again and again and again.
- And what's "Zero, zero, zero"?
- It's horrendous. I don't know.
- And that's it?
- No.
Then it told me to get an electric carving knife and cut his head off.
It's not funny, Penny. It's the most terrifying experience of my life.
- So real, it could have been real.
- Have you told Dennis?
Of course not. The last thing
I want to do is excite him.
I tell you, Penny, I'm still waiting to scream about it.
- Come along.
- Along where?
- We're gonna look in the case.
- Don't be so silly.
Dennis doesn't even have a briefcase.
He loathes them.
- Uses an old doctor's bag.
- Then, with all due respect,
I hardly see that I should be the one accused of being silly.
It's you that's had the silly dream.
And, under the circumstances,
I'm surprised you get to sleep at all.
I personally would be up all night with a revolver.
It's not just the dream, Penny.
Ever since Dennis came out of hospital, he's been peculiar, sexually.
He's obsessed with blackheads and fucking.
- And not in that order.
- But you've always adored fucking.
Not when I'm cleaning my teeth, I don't!
Not when I'm doing anything, I don't.
The truth is, Penny,
I can't bear him touching me.
I don't know why, but I can't.
I'm running out of headaches.
He's absolutely sex mad.
Yesterday evening, he said he wished I had nipples on my arse.
Don't!
That's just the least of it.
Lord, they're arriving.
I'll tell you about this later.
You breathe a word of this to anyone,
Penny, and I'll absolutely kill you.
- Hello.
- Ah!
- Hello, darling.
- Mm! Dying for a pee. This is Monica.
- Hello, Monica. Come and have a drink.
- Thank you.
- Penny Wheelstock.
- Hello.
- This is the most lovely room.
- Thank you.
And, uh, how long have you been married?
- Seven years.
- Congratulations.
- Snap.
- Sorry?
- You're wearing Le De. Givenchy.
- Oh!
It's my totally favourite scent, and they've stopped making it.
Have they? I bought it in Marbella.
Did you? Well, you're lucky.
It's extinct.
Richard, darling, can I get something over with?
- Then we can all forget about it.
- Sure.
I didn't really want to have this party.
I thought we might be rushing it a bit.
Dennis's psychiatrist thinks it's a good idea to get him back into the swim.
But he's all right, isn't he?
- I've never seen him on such good form.
- Absolutely. He's fine.
But he just had his stitches out, so naturally, we're a bit apprehensive.
So if anything happens, which I'm certain it won't, the idea is we all sort of go along with him.
- We humour him, discreetly.
- Not exactly, Penny.
We just behave normally.
I don't want him excited.
- I certainly don't want any arguments.
- What's the matter with him?
He was overworked and nearly had a breakdown, but he's much better now.
You're alive.
Can you speak?
You don't look at all well, you know.
Not being a medical man,
I wouldn't take my word for it, but I'd say you had the mark.
You look like a doomed bollock.
- I want to speak to my wife.
- Oh, you can talk, can you?
Let me speak to Julia, and I swear I'll never speak again.
Speak to her of what, boil?
I want her to see my film. Please?
Oh, so that's what's worrying you, is it?
Well, let me put your mind at rest.
Firstly, on a purely ideological basis, it's out of the question.
And second, I burnt it.
- Oh, no!
- Oh, yes.
And prepare yourself for another little fluctuation of blood pressure, cos it's not the only thing I've burnt.
- I've also burnt Julia's diaphragm.
- Oh, no!
Oh, yes! It's time Julia had a baby.
- Ogre!
- Hopefully a baby boy-bol.
You are a criminal ogre.
It's all quite normal, boil.
Now, I intend to commence vigorous intercourse at about one am.
I don't want to go too far into the details of what this might mean, but if I was you,
I'd have an early night.
Cut your throat, monster.
In the name of humanity, cut your filthy throat.
Don't start getting emotional.
I'll do everything I can to harm you!
You can't harm me, you miserable little bit of garbage.
You'll be dead in a couple of days, so why don't you try and do it with some dignity?
Dignity? You're corruption.
Julia! Julia!
50 per cent of politics is about creating a problem.
The other 50 percent is about offering to solve it.
All you've got to do is bugger something up, then hasten to your nearest
TV station with a solution.
Doesn't matter what it is.
The environment, hospitals, crime...
Create a crime wave and up will pop some perfectly plausible head-selling police.
- The rock through the window technique.
- That's exactly what it is.
It might work on everyone else.
It doesn't work on me.
If you breathe air, it works on you.
Large one, no ice, please, Richard.
If you're aware of it, how can you bear to work in an industry that perpetuates it?
It's probably a defect from birth.
Come and rescue me. I'm being attacked.
- Who's attacking you?
- Penelope here.
She's telling me off because
I think your husband's a genius.
It's outrageous that Dennis should be allowed to manipulate children's minds.
There is the dear boy. Come along.
I want to ask you both a question.
Is that him?
- He's very good-looking.
- If you like that sort of thing.
- Julia seems terribly tense.
- Surprised? It's him.
He had an operation.
Went weird in the bed department.
- What do you mean?
- Sex. Hello, Basil.
- Hello, Penny. Lovely party.
- Super.
- Apparently, he's insatiable.
- Really?
Dick, dick, dick, dick, dick.
Shouldn't really be telling you this.
It was said in the strictest of confidence.
And that's exactly how I'm telling you.
She said he's got a permanent horn.
- Really?
- She said she's desperate.
The other night, she woke up and caught him down the bed with a huge black rubber torch.
- Torch?
- Flashlight.
- Doing what?
- Scrutinising.
He was under the covers.
Said he'd lost something. Contact lens.
Said he didn't want to wake her up.
And unlucky for her that he did, cos she got another hour's worth.
I'm not going to make a speech.
I'd just like to thank you all for coming and for making our anniversary so special.
And most of all, I'd like to thank Julia for organising it all and for being such a special wife.
How about a toast to Bagley and Julia?
- Bagley and Julia.
- Bagley and Julia.
I'd also like to propose a small snifter to our new star.
- I thought she was coming.
- She is, she's been held up.
- To Phyllis Blokey.
- Phyllis.
- Phyllis.
- Blokey.
- She's the singer with the boils.
- To boils, acne and blackheads.
What's this cream going to be called, anyway?
Don't know yet. Right now we're stuck with "Filthy Harry's Final Solution".
- Who's Filthy Harry?
- You know, Harry Wax. Creative.
- The only man here in a hired suit.
- He's as close as a Doberman's balls.
Don't want to say anything bad about him.
- Then don't.
- This is excellent.
Yes, I was about to say,
I notice Penny's gone carnivorous.
- She lacked protein.
- And minerals.
I wasn't getting all I needed out of normal green stuff.
I don't think anyone would ever encourage me to grow boils.
You're not the market
I'm after, darling.
But if you were, I would.
I could sell you anything from a boil to a hydrogen bomb.
- I don't think so. I'm anti-nuke.
- Hear, hear.
How's the new book coming along, Penny?
Shall I tell you why people buy hydrogen bombs?
Because they're not like the bombs people used to use in wars.
We put an added ingredient into bombs these days.
It's called peace.
Our warheads are stuffed to the brim with it.
We're years ahead of the competition, of course.
- The Russians don't put peace in theirs.
- Very good, Bagley.
Can anyone think of a discreet way of changing the subject?
I'm sorry, Julia. I'm afraid
Dennis is absolutely right.
There's a splendid example of what he's talking about outside our building.
- Ever looked at it?
- Can't say as I have.
Well, there's an obelisk there to the glory of the Royal Marines, and it's a plaque depicting a Marine shoving his bayonet into a Chinaman's guts.
He's so shocked, his pigtail's sticking up like an exclamation mark.
And underneath it says,
"Shanghai Campaign, 1898."
Imagine seeing that in Peking.
A plaque of a Chinaman pumping his bayonet into an Englishman halfway up Regent Street, a bowler hat, levitating in shock, and underneath,
"West London Campaign, 1898."
Why don't you shut your trap, you cynical old anus?
A joke. Just a joke.
Don't think the bandages might be a bit on the tight side, Bagley?
No. Perfect, thank you.
Julia! Julia!
Are you all right, darling?
Marvellous.
Would you excuse me for a moment?
I tell you, he's absolutely barking.
Criminal. You filthy criminal!
Shut up, you little moron!
I'd like to wring your bastard neck!
Do it, then. Do it.
Put me out of my misery.
Oh, no, not yet, you unwholesome pustule.
I want you to live just a bit longer.
I want you around tonight when the shagging begins.
Tasty bit of glue, is it?
Here, have another suck.
Let's hear you squawk now.
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they would doubt my love
Yet today, my love has gone away
I am without my love
Come on, Julia. Come and dance.
Not now, darling.
Come on. I insist.
Go on. It's his anniversary.
Smoke gets in your eyes
- Have you got a cold?
- Not my drug.
I know that smell. Givenchy.
Oh! You don't have to hold me quite so tightly, Dennis.
Sorry. Afraid the clinch is the only dance I know.
Heh.
Oh, Julia. Julia, darling.
No. Monica.
I know.
Julia. Please don't scream or pull away.
We might never get this chance again.
It's difficult for me to talk, because my sinuses are full of glue.
You're not wearing a bra.
Not really.
I love you. I love you desperately.
This isn't a dream. It's reality.
Don't speak. Just listen. I'm desperate.
You're going to need a condom, and quick!
The fucking's going to start in about an hour, and believe me, you're going to have a monster on top of you.
Aah!
Stay away from me! Keep away!
Has the bastard been whispering to you?
Bastard! Bastard!
- It's all right.
- Bastard!
Oh!
Everything's under control.
Please stay and enjoy the party.
- Sorry.
- Monica?
I'm sorry, Julia, but I think your husband's completely bananas!
Going along with someone is not the same as listening to a tirade of obscenity!
- What did he say?
- I can't tell you.
- I'm sorry, Julia.
- Bye, darling.
- Lovely party.
- Thank you.
- Richard, your case.
- Oh, no, it's not mine.
It belongs to Bagley.
He left it at the studio.
Boil?
Boil!
Boil.
Boil!
Can you hear me, boil?
Where has he hidden the briefcase?
The world is in danger, Julia.
The greed is out of control.
Greed is abolishing the future.
It's turning truth inside out and upside down.
And this is its poisonous mouthpiece.
Oh, Christ, I think I've woken him up.
I'll have to be quick.
What I have to explain is the mechanics of a holocaust.
And I'm not talking about atom bombs, darling.
I'm talking about hamburgers.
I had a nasty feeling
I was going to have to wake up to this.
If I was you, Julia, I'd turn this off.
- It's only going to upset you.
- You see what a nightmare I'm in.
You see why I can't talk to you.
- Who are you talking to, then?
- God, it converses!
- I'm talking to it.
- I need a cigarette.
- Be silent, you Moloch.
- Moloch?
Yes, yes, you, you Moloch, you bogey!
If you insist we have to listen to this bullshit, I need a cigarette.
All right, I'll get you one, but on one condition.
That you keep quiet while you're smoking it.
Don't turn off, darling.
60 seconds, and I'll be back.
Penny said you had a bad dream.
Did she? Well, she shouldn't have.
She said the boil had spoken to you.
It didn't. Believe me, it didn't.
- It told me where you'd hidden the case.
- It didn't.
I told you where I'd put the briefcase.
I didn't dare wake up and ask why you decided to vacuum clean me in the middle of the night.
I told you where I'd put the case because I'm all too aware of the tension you've been trying to conceal.
And, painful though it is for me,
I thought by letting you discover the film for yourself, it would have some sort of therapeutic effect.
There'd be no more secrets, nothing left to hide.
I realise, of course, that was foolish.
If the boil didn't speak to me, how did I know the combination?
Because it's written up in the kitchen.
It's been on the bulletin board for weeks.
You must have seen it 200 times.
I never noticed noticing it.
It's on a red and white receipt.
I'll go and get it, if you like.
I realise I've been very selfish.
So busy thinking of the stress I was under,
I'd completely forgotten what a terrible time it's been for you.
I really don't want you to watch this, darling.
I intended to burn it.
It's only going to upset you.
I'm already upset.
Please be quiet.
Are you there? I pray you're there.
I've just seen you in the kitchen.
I know you think I'm crazy, but in a minute, I'll show you my film and you can judge my madness for yourself.
Everything's assembled from my old ads.
All I've done is re-edit them, re-voice them and put in the truth.
No truth ever gets out of here.
They've got this bastard by the balls.
Greed has installed its lackeys into the highest offices in this land, and they're conducting a crime wave of unprecedented ferocity.
Anywhere you want to look, they're at it.
Oil companies sold as champions of the environment.
Wild animals prancing through the woodlands.
Meanwhile, the filth from their cars is wiping out half the forests of Europe.
- I can't listen to any more of this.
- You swore you'd be quiet!
Yeah, but I'd forgotten what a nightmare you are.
I want to be heard. I want to be heard!
- I want a drink.
- Then get it yourself.
Jesus, I've forgotten what I was going to say.
I believe you were about to explain why hamburgers are going to be the cause of World War III.
That's right, you cynical bastard.
- We're all ears.
- How can you argue with the television?
Because this poor, sick creature with a box on his head was me.
I know exactly what I'm going to say.
Destruction of the rainforests by, amongst other things, hamburgers, is going to lead to a world commodity crisis, and the commodity will be oxygen.
- What mad bollocks.
- It is not mad bollocks.
They're turning rainforests into deserts.
Within 25 years, the Brazilians will be fixing oxygen prices in exactly the same way as the Arabs fix the price for oil.
- No more!
- You want the air, you pay for it.
- No more!
- Leave it on, Dennis!
I want to watch the film!
I don't know how you can say that.
You know what this does to me, reliving this nightmare?
Look at him. He's got a cigarette stuck in his bandages. The man's mad.
Why do you keep calling him him? It's you!
All right, me. It was me. But I was ill.
You were the one that said so.
You can't have it both ways, darling.
You said I needed help, and I got help, and now I'm better, which is why I can't bear to watch this dreadful insanity.
Insanity?
You still want to sell 'em boils!
Nothing crazy about that.
It's a free market.
People will either buy or they won't buy.
Nobody's forcing them.
Everyone knows what they're getting.
- Perhaps they don't.
- Of course they do.
People might be a bit greedy from time to time, but we're not blind, we've got our eyes open.
- We have a choice.
- Perhaps.
Stop saying perhaps!
What's perhaps got to do with it?
Perhaps they don't.
Perhaps if they'd hanged Jesus Christ, we'd all be kneeling in front of a fucking gibbet!
That isn't the real world.
In the real world, I have a choice.
Do I want it, or don't I?
And in this case,
I most certainly do not.
"I thought leaving you was going to be so difficult.
"But the impossible becomes easy when you have no choice.
"I want something better now that can't be bought.
"I want a better world than yours is, Dennis.
"I'm not gonna try and explain it,
"because I know you couldn't possibly understand.
"Goodbye. Julia."
God, how can you be so naive?
Everything you've ever looked at was yours.
What more could you possibly want?
- The truth.
- Shut up, you dozy scab!
I thought you were dead.
Not for nothing, cos she's free.
You lose. You lose.
Oh, no I don't.
You're talking to Dennis Dimbleby Bagley.
And let me tell you something, boil.
She's got nowhere to go.
We're living in a shop.
The world is one magnificent fucking shop, and if it hasn't got a price tag, it isn't worth having.
There is no greater freedom than freedom of choice, and that's the difference between you and me, boil.
I was brought up to believe in that, and so should you, but you don't.
You don't want freedom, do you?
You don't even want roads.
God, I never want to go on another train as long as I live.
Roads represent a fundamental right of man to have access to the good things in life.
Without roads, established family favourites would become elitist delicacies.
A pot of soup would be for the few.
There'd be no more tea bags, no instant potatoes, no long-life cream.
There'd be no aerosols.
Detergents would vanish.
So would tinned spaghetti and baked beans with six frankfurters.
The right to smoke one's chosen brand would be denied.
Chewing gum would probably disappear.
So would pork pies.
Foot deodorisers would climax without hope of replacement.
When the hydrolysed protein and monosodium glutamate reserves ran out, food would rot in its packets.
Jesus Christ, there wouldn't be any more packets.
Packaging would vanish from the face of the earth.
But worst of all, there'd be no more cars.
And more than anything, people love their cars.
They have a right to them.
If they have to sweat all day in some stinking factory making disposable lighters or Christmas trees, by Christ, they're entitled to them.
They're entitled to any innovation technology brings, whether it's ten per cent more of it or 15 per cent off of it!
They're entitled to it.
They're entitled to one of four important new ingredients.
Why should anyone have to clean their teeth without important new ingredients?
Why the hell shouldn't they have their CZT?
How dare some snotty Marxist carbuncle presume to deny them it?
They love their CZT!
They want it! They need it!
They positively adore it!
By Christ, while I've got air in my body, they're going to get it!
They're gonna get it bigger and brighter and better!
I'll put CZT in their margarine if necessary, shove vitamins in their toilet rolls.
If happiness means the whole world standing on a double layer of foot deodorisers,
I, Bagley, will see that they get them!
I'll give them anything and everything they want!
By God, I will!
I shall not cease till Jerusalem is builded here on England's green and pleasant land!

THE FIRST ACT
THE EKDAHL FAMILY CELEBRATES CHRISTMAS
It takes longer every year.
Worthy Joseph, do not fear
Thy angel is thee ever near.
I come in haste to bring thee word from thy creator and thy God.
Mary and the child now wake and quickly into safety take.
Herod with his murdering hand threatens every man-child in this land.
All this I have noted well and shall do as you foretell.
Praised be God upon his throne who thus protects my only son.
Thus, good people, ends our play.
It all ends well this holy day.
The son of God, saved from the sword is our saviour,
Christ the lord.
We know that in his mercy mild he guards every woman, man and child.
Though far from Bethlehem we roam the star in the east leads us home.
Merrily may every light shed its radiance clear and bright.
A time of joyous Christmas cheer we wish to all, both far and near.
Let no one into darkness fall.
A merry Christmas one and all.
Traditionally the Ekdahls give a party for the theatre staff down on the stage.
The guests are what you'd call a rather mixed lot.
Quite different from what we're used to here in the theatre restaurant.
Nevertheless, I don't want to see any supercilious glances, snootiness, or raised eyebrows.
I want to see generosity, warmth and kindness. Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
- That's the spirit!
Alma and Petra, take the Christmas basket.
I'll take the punch bowl.
- Are we ready?
- Yes, sir.
Forward march!
Come along, Carlchen.
We mustn't be late to your mother's like last year.
Come along.
Hurry up.
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas, Oscar.
Help yourselves, everybody!
Step forward, step forward. Don't be shy.
When you've given Ismael his dinner, turn off the lights in the shop and lock up.
I have the key.
Good night, Aron.
Good night, uncle Isak.
This is the 43rd Christmas we're celebrating together.
My dear ester, is it possible?
Yes, the 43rd.
Well, well, who'd have thought it?
Yes, it's odd.
Dear ester.
Good evening, Mrs. Ekdahl.
Good evening, girls.
- Alida, you may join the other girls.
- Thank you, Mrs. Ekdahl.
- Why are you so sullen?
- I'm not sullen.
I can see you are.
You're always sullen on Christmas eve.
- I don't know what you mean.
- You heard me. You're sullen.
Old hag.
My dear friends.
For 22 years... in the capacity of theatre manager,
I've stood here and made a speech... without really having any talent... for that sort of thing.
Especially if you think of my father, who was brilliant at speeches.
My only talent, if you can call it that in my case... is that I love this little world... inside the thick walls of this playhouse.
And I'm fond of the people who work in this little world.
Outside is the big world, and sometimes the little world succeeds... in reflecting the big one... so that we understand it better.
Or perhaps we give the people who come here a chance to forget for a while... for a few short moments... for a few short moments... the harsh world outside.
Our theatre is... a little room... of orderliness, routine, care... and love.
I don't know why I feel... so comically solemn... this evening.
I can't explain how I feel, so I'd best be brief.
My wife and I... and the rest of the Ekdahl family, my brother Carl
- I think Carl is here.
We wish you all a happy and joyous Christmas.
I hope we meet again on St. Stephen's day, strengthened in body and soul.
Merry Christmas.
Isak!
Merry Christmas.
I can't think where they all are.
They should have been here a long time ago.
I expect Oscar is making a long, dull speech.
I think I hear them down in the street.
Ester, bring me my fur.
There comes my family.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, grandma.
Merry Christmas, aunt.
Mama, you look so beautiful.
What is it, darling?
Aunt Emma, how nice to see you.
Aunt Emma, how nice. Welcome.
What time is it?
The only question is:
Where are Carl and Lydia?
Perhaps they got the wrong time.
Christmas dinner is always at 4:30.
Alexander, run down and ring uncle Carl's doorbell.
- Carlchen, please hurry.
- Shut up!
- We're so late.
- Shut up!
We arrive late every year.
- I'm doing this for your sake.
- No more, mein Carlchen.
- Mama.
- Well, Carl.
Merry Christmas, aunt.
Well, at last we can have dinner.
Now for the first sing hop faderallan lallan lay and those who don't the first one take will also number two forsake now for the first sing hop faderallan lallan lay cheers, Isak and miss Alida.
I've got terrible heartburn.
I have to take a pill.
Mr. Jacobi, how awful!
The Ekdahls will be the death of me.
After last Christmas,
I was in bed for three weeks with kidney pains.
- You don't say.
- Worse than childbirth.
Does miss Alida have children?
Good heavens, no.
Why do you ask?
I'm in need of a housekeeper, miss Alida.
Thank you, sir, but I like it with the Ekdahl family.
Let's discuss it after the new year.
Well, there's no harm in discussing it.
So you see, my brother Gustav Adolf Ekdahl is a magnificent human being.
Then you brown the breasts, but use plenty of butter in the pan, and fry some prime pork at the same time.
Then you put the ground meat on top of the breast, and the pork on top of that.
Finally, you pour the port sauce with mushrooms on top of everything.
Hey, Christmas gnomes let's raise our glasses and be merry our time on earth is brief full of toil and grief hey, Christmas gnomes let's raise our glasses and be merry no appetite, miss ester?
Miss Vega, you're not eating anything yourself.
It's not easy, I must say.
No, it's not easy.
You're right.
It's unseemly, all of us sitting together like this.
I agree with you.
It's unseemly.
Sitting together in the kitchen.
It was the old master who decided --
Be that as it may.
It's awkward nonetheless.
Yes, it is. It's awkward.
Well, Fanny, we're having a pleasant time, aren't we?
I think dinner is taking too long.
You're wondering what you'll get for Christmas, of course.
Aren't you, uncle Gusten?
You're absolutely right, my dear.
I'm quite curious as to what the evening will bring.
Frau von Bahlen.
My dear husband has implored me to sing something after dinner.
I said I couldn't, but he's so persistent.
He says my singing reminds him of our youthful days in Munich.
My husband is so touching,
Frau von Bahlen.
Sometimes he's like a child.
Your father is a magnificent human being.
You think I'm being sarcastic.
I'm never sarcastic when I'm in good spirits.
So believe me, Petra, when I say... then you add carrots, sprouts, red cabbage and cauliflower, and then you pour cognac over the whole thing.
We'll have to try it on twelfth night
- if we're still alive, of course.
Dear friends,
I would like to make a speech.
But I'm not going to.
Cheers, Carl.
Short and sweet!
This is the 24th Christmas I've celebrated with the family.
My dear Emma, is it really possible?
Yes, my Karl-Henrik died in '79.
Was it that long ago?
He'd be 98 years old if he were living today.
My dear Emma, imagine that.
I was 19 when we got married.
You were only 19?
A great age difference.
There's no denying that.
But you were fond of --
My sister also married an older man.
Yes, I remember.
It was a magnificent wedding.
He died three months later, leaving a fortune behind.
Karl-Henrik did no such thing.
No, he certainly didn't.
Putte!
Try sitting up properly for once.
Elbows down and back straight.
You really have awful table manners.
Berta, since you're sitting next to my father, could you ask him for me if I may be spared being taught manners on Christmas eve?
- Siri.
- What is it, Jenny?
Are you mad about something?
Not at all.
Why do you ask?
You're not laughing like everybody else.
Some people find it hard to laugh.
Why?
Some people bear a great sorrow, for instance.
And it grows larger and larger when others are happy?
For some people,
Christmas is a bit difficult.
Why?
Well, Jenny, there are so many memories.
Maybe you'll be happy by next Christmas.
Maybe.
Aunt Anna?
Yes, Alexander?
Since you're so rich, you could get any man you please.
- You think so, Alexander?
- That's what father says, anyway.
That's nice to hear.
So, you're leaving us to get married, miss Berta.
Yes, sir, I am.
Well, it's going to be damned lonely without you.
Both my wife and I --
It looks like you'll have some consolation.
Here's to old times, miss Berta.
Cheers, sir... and good luck.
A rhyme for the porridge.
"Our porridge is our strength and stay it is our staple food in joy, in grief, both night and day it always does us good" look! I found the almond!
Four cheers for the coming year's little bride-to-be!
Now it's Yule again, now it's Yule again and Yule will last until it's Easter that's not true of course no, that's not true of course for in between comes lent and fasting what would Maj say to a little visit in her room this evening?
The master must be joking.
Are you all right, sir?
I'm fine.
I must help the girls with the tree.
Have you noticed that my old man has begun to court Maj?
- Aren't you angry?
- Angry?
I think it's sweet.
Children, come.
Uncle Carl is going to treat you to one helluva fireworks show.
Stay here.
Ready?
Number one.
Now comes number two.
Now comes number three.
Bring the candle.
"And it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.
And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.
And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.
And Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea... unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem... because he was of the house and lineage of David, to be taxed with Mary his wife, who was great with child.
And so it was that while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.
And she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn."
- Give up?
- No!
I'm sorry.
It's a terrible mess in here.
Come see us later and you'll get a Christmas present.
Thank you, Mrs. Ekdahl.
Now then, children, into bed.
Hurry up, Alexander.
To bed now, children.
Now say your prayers.
Thank you God for this day.
Please make me good.
May your angel stay by me through the night.
God bless papa and mama, grandpapa and grandmama, myself and my brothers and sisters and cousins, uncles and aunts,
Vega, Ester, Maj, Siri, Berta, Alida,
Lisen and uncle Isak and everybody else.
Amen.
- Good night, Alexander.
- Good night, sweetheart.
Good night. Sleep well.
Putte kisses like a real man.
Look at my Christmas present.
Look what Mrs. Ekdahl gave me.
Aren't I beautiful?
Don't I look lovely?
I look like a real lady.
Don't you think?
Tonight you can't sleep in Maj's bed because Maj will have a visitor.
And I can't just have any number of men in my bed.
But you're Maj's sweetheart.
You know that.
I think mama should recite something.
No, my dear.
Calm down, now.
Don't be shy.
You give wonderful recitations.
No, I don't know.
I'll have to fortify myself.
I don't know what to read.
Well, you asked for it.
Alone I advance on my course farther and farther stretches the road alas, in the distance my goal is hidden dusk is falling, night fills the sky soon the everlasting stars are all I see but I do not lament the fleeting day the coming night does not appal me for of the love that shines through the world a gleam has entered my soul how beautiful.
Well, my dear ones, it's time to say good night.
We're getting up early.
Carlchen! Wake up.
We're going home.
Good night, mama. Carl's a bit tired.
I'll give him a hand.
Come along now.
We're going home.
Good night.
Good night, mama.
- I stayed behind.
- So I noticed.
There she lies, the beautiful girl, poor Arabella.
Little does she know what awaits her.
She's alone in the whole house.
Her mother is dead, and her father is carousing with loose companions.
Who comes there as the clock strikes 12:00 in the castle tower?
"Fear seizes me.
What is that terrifying white figure floating on the moonbeams and drawing near my bed?
It is my dead mother.
My mother's ghost."
No more noise in here now!
Go to sleep, children.
Good night.
I thought I smelled kerosene in the nursery.
- Kerosene?
- Yes, kerosene.
There's no kerosene lamp in the nursery.
Well, it smells like it anyway.
I'll go see what it could be.
It really does smell of kerosene.
Are you sleeping, you brats?
What have you been up to?
That's strange.
Yes, very strange.
This is a chair.
But not just any chair.
It might look like an ordinary nursery chair, made of wood, humble and rather worn... but looks can be deceiving.
It's actually the most valuable chair in the world.
It belonged to the emperor of china and has by strange paths ended up in the Ekdahl nursery.
But pay attention, ladies and gentlemen.
Look closely.
Keep your eyes open.
Look there.
Do you see the mysterious light that radiates from that little chair?
That's right.
It glows from within.
Look how it shines.
Now I ask you, my children:
Why does the chair shine?
Why does it shimmer in the dark?
I'll tell you, but remember:
It's a secret.
Whoever reveals it will perish.
Do you swear to keep quiet?
- We swear.
Not so loud.
Mother could hear us.
And that would be the end of the performance.
This is the most valuable chair in the world.
It's made of a metal found
40 miles beneath the earth, and only in china.
Though it appears encrusted with diamonds, it's much finer and more costly.
The chair was built 3,000 years ago by the emperor's master jeweller as a birthday present for the empress.
She was very small in stature, not much bigger than Fanny, but she was the world's most beautiful woman.
Her entire life she sat on this chair.
Two servants accompanied her wherever she went, carrying the chair between them.
When the empress died, she was buried sitting on this chair.
For 2,000 years she sat in her burial chamber.
The chair shimmered in the dark, its light shining right through the empress's little figure.
But then a band of robbers came and broke into the tomb.
They knocked the empress off the chair, and she turned to powder and dust.
Then they made off with the chair.
Now it belongs to you.
The most precious chair in the world belongs to you.
Take care of it, for it's very fragile.
It might easily fall to pieces.
Touch it gently.
Sit on it very carefully.
Talk to it.
And at least twice a day breathe on it.
What an idiotic little chair!
So worn and ridiculous!
And ugly, to boot!
I'll be damned!
I think the confounded chair is trying to bite my rear end!
I'll show it!
Don't do that!
Have you all gone mad?
It's 3:00 in the morning!
We have to get up for church in two hours!
- Can we be in Hamlet?
- Please.
I know you've spoken with Mr. Landahl, but this is a matter for father to decide.
It's for mother to decide.
It's much too late for children who have school the next day.
No, it's not.
We can be pages in the first act.
Who's not in the last act can't be in the first.
It has to be different pages in the last act anyway.
Good night, kids.
On the condition that you do your homework... and come straight home after the court scenes.
And absolutely no whining about getting up the next morning.
Here we go, Isak.
I've made some nice strong coffee.
Much better than Vega's awful dishwater.
Give this a try.
What can the time be?
Ten past 3:00.
We can sit for two hours, and then I must change for early service.
How good it is to have you here!
You're my best friend.
Whatever would I do without you?
Last year I enjoyed Christmas.
This year all I wanted to do was cry.
I suppose I'm getting old.
Do you think I've aged?
You've grown older, yes.
I thought so.
Yes, I just wanted to cry.
Though I love having the grandchildren, of course.
I didn't think Oscar looked well.
He wears himself out with that theatre.
And the idea of him playing the ghost.
He should take it easy.
Besides, he's an awfully bad actor.
I wonder if Emilie realizes that he's weak and needs rest.
I think I'll have a word with her.
He's capable, of course.
Capable and conscientious.
Can you believe the theatre even makes a small profit?
Isn't that splendid?
A few years ago I contributed a minimum of 50,000 kronor per year.
I didn't care, but Oscar felt so awkward asking me for money.
Not like Carl.
He asked me for a new loan, but I refused.
If he comes to you for money, you must say no too.
Promise me that.
- Yes, yes.
I don't understand it.
Time and again I clear everything up for him.
After a year, he's in dire straits again.
He says he doesn't go to moneylenders.
- Do you know?
- No.
And that poor German woman he's married to.
How could he have fallen for her?
It must be something erotic.
What do you think?
Erotic? Yes, perhaps.
- You're not listening.
- Yes, I am.
Never mind.
The main thing is that you keep me company.
Carl and Gustav Adolf are oversexed.
They take after their father.
He was oversexed.
At times I thought it was too much of a good thing, but I never refused.
Gustav Adolf is incorrigible.
I've spoken with Alma, and she wisely says she doesn't mind his philandering, because he's the kindest husband in the world.
It's fortunate that alma is so understanding.
Perhaps I ought to warn that nursemaid Maj, or whatever her name is.
I must say she's very pretty, and good with the children.
Beautiful colouring and a nice figure.
Pity she limps, the poor thing.
What you don't poke your nose into you don't have to pull it out of, as grandma used to say.
- Are you asleep?
- No, no.
Carl and Gustav Adolf got too much, and Oscar got nothing.
Imagine the tragedy for Emilie, who's such a warm-blooded young woman.
When she was pregnant with Fanny, she told me all about it.
Poor girl.
I have to say she's handled her affairs in a most tactful manner.
Oscar and Emilie are enormously fond of each other.
A happy marriage in spite of everything.
Are you sad because you've grown old?
I'm certainly not.
Everything's getting worse.
Worse people, worse machines, worse wars... and worse weather.
I'm glad I'll soon be dead.
You're an incorrigible old misanthrope and always have been.
- I don't agree with you.
- I thought as much.
That doesn't stop me from crying.
Would you mind if I cry a while?
No, upon my soul, I can't.
The tears won't come.
I'll have to have some more cognac.
What are you laughing at?
Do you remember when we sat there on the sofa kissing madly?
You had unbuttoned my blouse, and something else too.
Then suddenly the curtain was drawn aside, and there stood my dear husband.
It was just like a play by Feydeau.
I screamed and you made for the door.
He rushed off to get his pistol, with me hanging on his leg.
You became friends for life.
Your husband was a great-hearted man.
Now I'm weeping.
The happy, splendid life is over, and the horrible, dirty life engulfs us.
That's the way it is.
This won't do.
I must wash up and redo my makeup, do my hair and put on my corset and silk dress.
A weepy, lovesick woman turns into a self-possessed grandmother.
We all play our parts.
Some play them negligently, others with great care.
I'm one of the latter.
Good night, my lovely Helena.
You were a sweet lover.
Like strawberries.
You wanted me to help you with your morning toilet, Mrs. Ekdahl.
The time is ten to 5:00.
A cafe on castle street.
Your own cakes and pastries, tarts and confections.
What do you say to that, little Maj?
You'd be in charge of it.
Just yesterday I said to alma,
"look at Maj.
She's a princess."
What breasts you have, my girl.
Let me see properly.
You drive me crazy.
Don't be afraid, child.
I'm a wonderful lover.
All the women say so.
Once you get me on my back, you'll forget about the cafe.
I swear.
Give me something to write on.
Come. Come over here.
Here's a pen.
Now I'll write:
"Maja kling... is the proprietress of my cafe."
Signed, Gustav Adolf Ekdahl.
Christmas night, 1907.
There! That's a contract.
Stick it under a lawyer's nose if I forget my promise.
Be careful not to put me in the family way.
Well, what do you say?
Aren't I nice?
Ever felt such a wooden leg?
Damnation!
The rocket went off too soon.
Oh, well, it happens.
Wasn't it wonderful?
You're a real Billy goat, sir.
And you're my little lamb.
I must lie on my back.
I'm all in a sweat.
- I ate and drank too much.
- You're not ill?
Not me!
I feel like a bakery ablaze.
Or should I say cafe?
Iii?
When I'm with such a tasty little morsel?
Sit on top of me.
Oh, you're impossible, sir!
Ride a rocking horse to Banbury cross to see a fine lady on a white steed what a glorious time we're having!
- My goodness, how your heart's pounding.
- I've got a splendid heart.
Now you'll have to give me a new bed.
You'll have a cafe, an apartment, beautiful furniture, and a big bed.
- And pretty clothes.
- No one will be prettier.
You will be Gustav Adolf's mistress, and I'll come see you every
Wednesday and Saturday at 3:00.
How silly you are.
- What?
- I said you're silly.
- Silly, am I?
- You're a real numbskull.
I'm not a numbskull!
You are, for imagining I'd want anything from you.
Don't you want anything?
Don't you see I was joking?
Joking?
In what way?
Don't be angry.
I'm not, but I don't like being treated like an idiot.
- Stop laughing.
- I think you're so funny.
I don't like being laughed at.
I can feel a cold coming on.
My throat hurts when I swallow.
My teeth are tingling.
It's freezing in here.
Why isn't there any heat?
We don't have any credit with the wood merchant.
We owe 150 kronor.
Das wei┈t du doch.
You haven't learned a damn bit of Swedish in 23 years.
Speak Swedish!
I do my best.
Last Tuesday I asked mama for ten thousand to sort out my affairs.
She took out a paper that said I owed her 37,000.
It's incredible.
- You'll have to go to the Jew.
- I've already been.
I'm paying one hell of an exorbitant interest rate, and if I don't pay on time, he'll show the iou to mama.
I have some jewellery.
Idiot.
That would be nice.
Professor Ekdahl running to the pawnbroker.
Aren't you coming to bed?
I feel ill.
There was something wrong with the herring salad.
It tasted stale.
I'm sure mama saved it from Easter, the stingy hag.
You don't serve herring salad for Christmas, damn it.
Why did I marry you?
You're ugly, poor and barren.
You couldn't even give me a child.
You never make love to me.
- Ich sage aber nichts.
- Speak Swedish.
Poor Carl.
You're so unhappy.
If you weren't so anxious --
The dean scolded me.
Said I'm neglecting my lectures.
I'm a scientist, the only real scientist in the whole damn university.
But nobody cares.
Oh, my head.
I have a terrible headache.
And we have to go to that damn early service!
Coercion at every turn!
No, Carlchen!
Then you have to smile matter-of-factly,
"dear mama, how beautiful you are.
You look like a young woman."
"Dear Emilie, I've never seen you play the Christmas angel so wonderfully."
"How is it, Oscar, that you succeed in everything you do?"
How do you do that?
Come, Carlchen.
Come and sit by me.
You smell bad.
Have you given up washing, or are you starting to rot?
No.
I don't smell bad at all.
You have olfactory hallucinations.
It's bleeding.
- Shall I bandage it up?
- No.
- Won't you try and get some sleep?
- Yes.
I feel sorry for you, mein Carlchen.
How is it one becomes second-rate?
Can you tell me that?
How does the dust fall?
When has one lost?
First I'm a prince, heir to the kingdom.
Suddenly, before I know it...
I'm deposed.
Death taps me on the shoulder.
The room is cold... and we can't pay for kindling.
I'm stupid and unkind.
And I'm most unkind... to the only person who cares for me.
You can never forgive me.
I'm a shit and a cad.
If you'd like,
I'll make you a hot toddy.
Don't be so damned servile!
Wipe your mouth.
Your lips are always wet. It's disgusting!
I don't mean to be unkind.
I know that, mein liebling.
Oh, life!
Insomnia, poverty and humiliation.
Stretch out your hand and you grope in the emptiness.
Why am I such a bloody coward?
You have your amusements.
- That's enough, mein liebling.
- Nothing troubles you.
I strike you and you kiss my hand.
I spit on you and you forgive me.
You're repulsive!
I can't stand your love.
I have to get away from you.
You'll have to go back to Munich.
We're getting a divorce.
I want to finally be spared seeing you, smelling you, listening to your damned gibberish.
I'll be spared your solicitude, your anxious eyes, your cloying love.
When you're sad and unhappy, you always talk like this.
I don't care anymore.
You know that.
I want to sleep.
Maybe I'll dream of a sweet-smelling female body... with small breasts and narrow hips, long legs... dark hair and cheerful personality.
Her legs and arms are wrapped around me, pressing herself against me.
We make love.
Her flesh is firm and generous.
Damnation!
Old age, prison, disgust!
No, Carlchen!
Stop! Stop it!
Don't touch me, damn it!
You know why I hate you so, mein liebchen?
You're a mirror image.
Kindness reflects kindness.
Mediocrity reflects mediocrity.
I see it contorting your face.
You suffer, but you endure it.
That's the big difference,
I will never endure it.
Good night.
Well, Gustav Adolf.
- Good morning, papa.
- Good morning, Petra.
Don't I get a kiss?
- Good morning, Gustav Adolf.
- Good morning, alma.
Go and fry three eggs and some ham for papa, and make two cheese sandwiches.
- What will you drink?
- Beer.
Petra, you know where the beer crate is.
No, wait,
I think there's some stout in the cupboard.
- Would you rather have stout?
- Yes.
Don't stand there staring.
We have to be at grandma's in an hour.
- How do you feel?
- Cognac.
- I've put out your clothes.
- Thank you.
And there's hot water if you want a bath.
That would be nice.
Hurry up now.
You're a damned handsome woman.
And you're a big shit.
- Come to bed.
- I just did my hair.
We'll have a quick one standing up.
- Petra's coming with breakfast.
- We'll lock the door.
Come on then, but make it quick.
- I don't think I can.
- You can't?
No.
There must be something wrong.
- You're not sick, are you?
- I'm fit as a fiddle.
- Lie down on the bed.
- Yes, I guess I could do that.
- Shall I bring in the breakfast tray?
- Yes, please.
To think that I haven't killed you.
Now what do you say?
I wonder if it will be a cold day.
I think it'll be very cold.
My thermometer says 4* below.
Don't yawn at the table, Alexander.
Cheers, brother Carl.
I heard the Bishop will be saying the service today.
Really?
I can't help it.
Your father's a bit nutty.
Excuse me.
Well, my friends, it's time.
THE SECOND ACT
THE GHOST REHEARSAL
My hour is almost come when I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames must render up myself.
Alas, poor ghost.
Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing to what I shall unfold.
Speak.
I am bound to hear.
So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear --
What?
I am thy father's spirit.
Doomed for a certain term to walk the night, and for the day confined to fast in fires till the foul crimes done in my days of nature are burnt and purged away.
But that I am forbid to tell the secrets of my prison house
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood, make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres.
But this eternal blazon must not be to ears of flesh and blood.
List, o list!
If thou didst ever thy dear father love... o God!
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
Murder!
Yes, murder!
Murder most foul, as in the best it is.
But this most foul... strange --
- ...and unnatural.
- Huh?
And unnatural.
Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift as meditation or the thoughts of love, may sweep to my revenge.
Now, Hamlet, hear.
'Tis given out, that sleeping in my orchard, a serpent stung me.
So the whole ear of Denmark is by a forged process of my death rankly abused.
But know, thou noble youth - the serpent that did sting thy father's life.
Huh? Did sting?
Thy father's life.
Did sting thy father's life now wears his crown o my prophetic soul!
My uncle?
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast, with witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts - o wicked wit and gifts, that have the power so to seduce - won to his shameful lust the will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
But soft!
Methinks I scent the morning air.
Mr. Landahl, shouldn't there be steps here?
Can somebody help Mr. Ekdahl down.
The steps were forgotten today.
Brief let me be.
Sleeping within my orchard my custom always of the afternoon upon my secure hour thy uncle stole with juice of cursed hebenon in a vial and in the porches of my ears did pour the leperous distilment, whose effect holds such an enmity with blood of man that swift as quicksilver it courses through the natural gates and alleys of the body and with a sudden vigour it doth possess and curd, like eager droppings into milk, the thin and wholesome blood:
So did it mine and a most instant tetter bark'd about most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust all my smooth body.
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand... of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatched.
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin, unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd, no reckoning made but sent to my account with all my imperfections on my head.
Oh, horrible, most horrible!
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be a couch for luxury and damned incest.
I've forgotten what I am to do.
You get up and exit upstage centre.
- Where am I?
- Here... at the theatre.
Let's go home and rest.
What's happened?
You're tired, that's all.
Shall I call for the ambulance?
What am I doing here?
You were acting.
I was acting?
Why was I acting?
Come along, Oscar.
Let's go home.
Am I going to die now?
Please help me.
I'll get a carriage.
He needs his overcoat.
Alexander, come along.
Come on.
Stop!
I said stop! Hey, you!
Take the cart behind you!
Come along, Alexander.
No.
No.
We know nothing yet.
Yes, let's hope so.
Thank you for calling.
- How is our dear Oscar?
- We can only hope.
- How is he?
- It's a matter of hours.
- Is he in pain?
- He sleeps most of the time.
Go see ester and Vega for hot chocolate and sandwiches.
I was over at the Gustavssons' and I met Mr. Albrektsson.
Just imagine, children.
This letter will go all the way to a mission in china.
Mr. Albrektsson told me his poodle had four puppies.
A friend of mine has lived there for 50 years.
He wondered if you'd like a puppy.
Mama won't let us have dogs or cats.
- We could keep it here.
- Really?
- Yes.
- Splendid.
Otherwise it'll be sold.
When I was in china, working in the fields with my friend, we had a dog and three cats.
- Want to play again?
- You take red, then.
Mr. Albrektsson makes lots of money on his dogs, but he wants to give this puppy away.
He's wealthy in his own right.
It's his wife's money, dear ester.
Would you two like a molasses sandwich?
Yes, please, miss Vega.
There, the letter's finished.
Come, Fanny, and I'll let you lick the envelope.
- Would you like to borrow the flute?
- No, thank you.
- You want to lick the stamp?
- No, thank you.
You lick the stamp, then.
Thank you, sweetheart.
Leave me alone.
Come in.
Your mama asked me to come get you.
Let's put down the sandwiches.
Hurry up, Alexander.
Come, Alexander.
Don't be afraid.
Come here, Alexander.
Come on.
I'll wait outside.
Come here, Fanny.
Tell Alexander there's nothing to be afraid of.
I'll tell him.
You needn't be afraid.
This is nothing to worry about.
I feel no pain.
I actually feel better than I have in a long time.
Don't be alarmed if I keep my eyes closed.
The light seems rather bright.
It doesn't matter if I close my eyes.
I could play the ghost now... really well.
Nothing.
Nothing... separates me from all of you.
Not now... and not later.
I know that.
I see it... quite clearly.
I'll be closer to you now... than when I lived.
Now I'd like to look at Alexander.
Father says there's nothing to be afraid of.
Don't be childish now.
Try to be a good boy.
Take care of the theatre.
Mr. Sandblad will explain the business side.
Artistic matters you'll decide on your own... as usual.
A simple funeral.
Don't forget.
Nothing Majestic in the cathedral... with Chopin's "funeral march."
Promise me that.
Everything must go on as usual.
Everything must go on as usual.
I'll soon be dead.
Will you hold my hand?
Eternity, Emilie.
Eternity.
Fanny, wake up.
You hear that?
My condolences.
Allow me to assure you that my family and I feel the very greatest sympathy in this difficult hour that has befallen you and your esteemed family.
It is our regiment's duty and honour, in keeping with our proud tradition, to be allowed to express our sympathy at the funeral service.
Allow me to kiss your hand in veneration and affection... and venture so boldly as to offer all the support an imperfect mortal can.
Alexander, come out.
The Bishop will be here any moment.
I don't give a damn!
Come out now.
Don't be stupid.
My deepest sympathy.
My dear Emilie Ekdahl... words are so inadequate.
Let's gather together.
Right foot.
It is with dismay that we gather around Oscar's bier.
A close friend has been taken, and we're left in distress.
We actors, who daily play with life and death, should not be so upset, but oddly enough, our dismay is greater --
...greater than others'.
The hour before he died, he was conscious.
He even laughed.
We spoke of practical things... the children's future and business matters.
We also spoke of our theatre.
Oscar said,
"everything must go on as usual, Emilie."
So we'll carry on as usual.
At Oscar's request,
I'll take over management of the theatre.
We resume rehearsals tomorrow.
The premiere of Hamlet will proceed as announced.
That's everything.
We'll all do our best.
Thank you.
Dear Emilie.
Oscar will be proud.
I'm so happy for your sake, dear Emilie.
Cock, piss, shit, fart, piss, hell, shit, cock, fart, shit, piss, fart, cock, cunt, damn, hell, crap, ass, piss, cock, butt, pussy.
Siri, tell the children they may leave the table.
Yes, ma'am.
Did you hear something?
Alexander, wake up!
There's something out there.
THE THIRD ACT
BREAK-UP
When that I was and a little tiny boy with a hey, ho, the wind and the rain.
A foolish thing was but a toy for the rain it raineth every day.
Did you hear Emilie wants to talk to us after the performance?
Doesn't sound good.
No.
But when I came to man's estate with hey, ho, the wind and the rain
'gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate.
For the rain it raineth every day.
But when I came, alas, to wive with hey, ho, the wind and the rain.
By swaggering could I never thrive.
For the rain it raineth every day.
Emilie, you want to speak with us afterwards?
What is it about?
But when I came unto my beds with hey, ho, the wind and the rain.
With tosspots still had drunken heads.
For the rain it raineth every day.
A great while ago the world begun with hey, ho, the wind and the rain.
But that's all one, our play is done and we'll strive to please you every day.
Well, that's that.
Better hurry up, you old ghost.
It's all a bunch of crap.
If you'd please sit down,
I'd like to talk to you.
My husband died a year ago today.
He wanted us to go on as usual, and we have gone on as usual, though everything has been different.
We draw the theatre over our heads like a security blanket.
Our dressing rooms are bright and warm.
The stage enfolds us in friendly shadows.
Playwrights tell us what to say and think.
We laugh, cry and rage.
People sit there in the dark, kindly disposed towards us.
They're remarkably loyal, though we often give them stones instead of bread.
Most of the time we're simply playing.
Almost always.
We play because we enjoy it.
And if we don't enjoy it, we sulk and blame the circumstances... never ourselves.
That's how it is.
So I pass my life in wonderful self-deception, with a keen eye for others' faults while glossing over my own.
I don't know what I really am, as I never cared to find out the truth about myself.
But I do care about myself, which is something different.
And I don't care about reality, either.
It's drab and uninteresting.
It doesn't concern me, unless, in one way or another, it concerns the part I'm playing.
Are you tired of the theatre?
I think so.
- You want to quit?
- Perhaps, and for good.
What will happen to us if you quit?
Even if I quit, everything will go on as before.
Who will be our manager?
We'll all decide that together when the day comes, if it comes.
I haven't yet made up my mind.
Now I suggest we say good night.
Good night.
Come children.
Let's change.
I need a drink and a sandwich.
Anyone care to join me?
I've received an offer from the Lindberg troupe, so it's all the same to me.
What did I tell you?
I think there's something behind this.
- Haven't you heard?
- You mean it's true?
Well, I'll be damned.
If music be the food of love, play on.
Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting --
Come, Alexander.
Stop fooling around.
Come on.
Good day, Alexander.
Please give my regards to your mother.
- You're gonna be sorry.
- What do you mean?
You'll soon find out.
Hi.
What's wrong?
Someone wishes to talk to you.
The hot chocolate will have to wait.
- What have I done?
- You know quite well.
- Good day, Alexander.
- Good day.
We met once before.
Under sadder circumstances, when I officiated at your father's funeral.
Since then, your mother has turned to me with her worries, as is only natural.
I am a close friend of your grandmother.
I'm the spiritual guide of the parish.
The Bishop has been very good to me during this difficult time.
We've also spoken of you, my son.
I've told the Bishop how proud I am of my well-behaved children.
You and your sister are doing well at school,
I'm told.
Diligent and attentive, and earning good grades.
Isn't that so, Alexander?
Don't be afraid.
I'm your friend and wish you well.
You believe me, don't you?
But diligence and good grades are not everything in this world.
Blow your nose, Alexander.
That's filthy!
Didn't Maj give you a clean handkerchief?
Yes.
Goddamn it all!
As I said, diligence and good grades aren't everything in this world.
Listen to the Bishop, Alexander.
I'm sure he is.
Isn't that so, Alexander?
You're anxious to know what I'm going to say.
You're a big boy now.
So I'll talk to you man to man.
Can you tell me --
Can you explain to me what a lie is and what the truth is?
You think that was a stupid question, and it probably was.
I was just kidding with you.
Of course you know what a lie is and what the truth is, don't you?
Splendid.
Splendid, my boy.
You also know why one lies.
Why does one lie?
Why does one lie?
Can you explain to me why one lies?
Because you don't want to tell the truth.
A very sly answer, my young friend.
But you won't get off so easily.
I asked you... why does one not tell the truth?
I don't know.
We have plenty of time, Alexander, and I'm so interested in your answer that I'm prepared to wait indefinitely.
You may not believe that, but it's true.
One lies to gain an advantage.
Good answer, my boy.
Good and concise.
Forgive me if I ask another question, a bit more personal this time.
Can you explain to your mother and me why you lied at school?
What?
Your teacher has written to me, saying that you've been spreading the most incredible lies.
Like what?
Sold to a circus!
Do you deny that you told your classmates that I sold you to a travelling circus, and that at the end of the semester they're coming to get you?
You are to train as an acrobat and circus rider, together with a gypsy your age named Tamara.
Your mother was both terrified and upset when she read the letter.
She didn't know what to do.
So I suggested I come over and discuss these unpleasant problems with you.
And here I am.
You should be grateful to the
Bishop for taking the time.
Do you understand, Alexander?
We've agreed that he who lies does so to gain an advantage.
So I ask, quite logically, what advantage did you gain by stating your mother had sold you to a circus?
I don't know.
I think you do know... but you're ashamed to answer.
You're ashamed, aren't you?
That's good, my son. Very good.
It shows you'll be on your guard against further fabrications in the future.
Go to your mother and ask her forgiveness for all the sorrow and worry you've caused her.
Go to your mother and ask her to forgive you.
You hear what I say, don't you?
I ask mother's forgiveness for lying, and I promise never to do it again.
Good, Alexander.
The matter is resolved and need never be mentioned again.
Imagination is a splendid thing, a mighty force, a gift from God.
It's held in trust for us by the great artists, writers and musicians.
I'll get Fanny.
Come, Alexander.
I have something important to tell you.
Edvard has asked if I will marry him.
I've accepted with gratitude and joy.
I've been alone for a long time, and my children need a firm hand.
A father.
Of course, a great deal will be --
May God in his mercy take care of our little family.
Let us kneel down and unite in a heartfelt prayer.
May God our father in his mercy take care of our little family and bless us and keep us from evil all the days of our life.
God give me strength to be a guardian and a worthy example to these little fatherless ones.
Give me strength as well to be a support to this lonely young woman.
In the 15th century, when this house was built, they didn't bother much about comfort.
My predecessors kept it all as it was, and I follow the tradition.
These old rooms have an imperishable beauty.
We should be grateful that we may live in an atmosphere of purity and austerity.
Ah, here come my mother and sister.
You're already here.
Welcome, Mrs. Ekdahl.
Thank you.
This is my sister Henrietta.
- Welcome to the Bishop's palace.
- Thank you.
Come and say hello, children.
This is Mrs. Tander, our capable cook, who's been with our family for 30 years.
This is my future wife, Mrs.
Emilie Ekdahl.
Good day, Mrs.
Ekdahl. Welcome.
These are our capable helpers: Karna,
Selma and little Justina.
Now we'll go see my aunt, who, alas, is sick and bedridden.
How are you today, aunt Elsa?
We have a visitor.
Don't be afraid, children.
Come and say hello.
My future wife, Mrs.
Emilie Ekdahl, the famous actress.
Hello, miss Bergius.
The children have fallen asleep.
It's late and we must go home.
- Not yet.
- What is it, Edvard?
I have a wish.
A single wish, but an important one.
You may change your mind if you find it impossible.
Tell me your wish.
I want you to come to my house without possessions.
What do you mean?
I want you to leave your home... your clothes, jewels, furniture... your valuables... your friends, habits and thoughts.
I want you to leave your former life entirely.
Am I to come naked?
I'm serious, my dear.
I want you to come to your new life as if newly born.
- And the children?
- The children also.
- Their toys, dolls, books...
- Nothing.
- I must talk to them.
- It's your decision.
I can decide for myself, but not for the children.
I must ask them.
They must sacrifice something for their mother's happiness.
You're angry.
Kiss me.
I'm not angry, not in the least.
I'll win them over.
Think it over, Emilie.
I've already thought it over.
For me it's not hard to grant your wish.
I've never cared for anything very seriously.
I've sometimes wondered if there wasn't something very wrong with my feelings.
I couldn't understand why nothing really hurt... why I never felt really happy.
I know now that the crucial moment has come.
I know that we'll hurt each other, but I'm not afraid.
I also know that we will make each other happy.
And I sometimes weep from fear, because time is so short, the days pass so quickly, and nothing lasts forever.
You say your God is the God of love.
It sounds so beautiful... and I wish I could believe as you do.
Perhaps one day I will.
My God is so different, Edvard.
He's like myself, amorphous and intangible.
I'm an actress.
I'm used to wearing masks.
My God wears a thousand masks.
He's never shown me his real face, just as I can't show you or him my real face.
Through you I'll come to know God's true nature.
Kiss me, now, and hold me in your arms, as only you can.
I, Olof Henrik Edvard Vergerus... take thee,
Elisabet Emilie Josefin Ekdahl... to be my wedded wife... to love you for better and for worse... and as a symbol of this love I give you this ring.
I, Elisabet Emilie Josefin Ekdahl... take thee,
Olof Henrik Edvard Vergerus, to be my wedded husband... to love you for better and for worse... and as a symbol of this love I take this ring.
In the name of God the father, son and holy ghost.
Amen.
For as much as you have consented in holy wedlock and have witnessed the same before
God and this Christian gathering,
I hereby confirm, as Christ' servant, this holy union.
I wonder if this is a good thing.
You saw how happy she was.
- I'm thinking of the children.
- They'll get used to it, dear mama.
He's a devil of a lady killer, the Bishop is.
You don't know that for sure, Carl.
I don't know why I just want to cry.
They should have taken a honeymoon.
I invited them to our house in Provence, but Emilie refused.
That's not so strange.
She has great respect for her new husband.
He's a handsome man, whatever you say.
- I expect he has false teeth.
- Petra, don't be silly.
His mother was nice.
They say the sister's a bitch.
I've a feeling we'll have Emilie back... quite soon.
Closed the children don't appear to have an appetite.
Everything's new and strange to them.
You must understand, Henrietta.
Perhaps they're turning up their noses at the food.
Let's be happy on our first evening together.
I have no desire to spoil it, but in the future --
Yes, I might as well mention it now.
In the future no one may leave the table without having eaten up --
Dearest Henrietta,
I'll tell my children what to do.
There's a basic rule in this house which no one must break, not even you, dear Emilie, and that is respect for the temporal gifts.
I think you've misunderstood an essential point, dearest Henrietta.
But I suggest we postpone this discussion to a more suitable time.
Forgive me, dear Emilie.
I am forgetting myself.
I'm sure you're a more capable housewife than I.
I'll ask your advice in all things.
Edvard has admonished me a hundred times.
It's not easy to realize one has become superfluous!
That will do, Henrietta.
Perhaps I may be allowed to share that we are early risers in this house, both weekdays and Sundays.
At 6:00 we gather for morning prayers in Edvard's study.
I'd also like to mention that we make our own beds and tidy our rooms.
In this house, punctuality, cleanliness and order are the rule.
Don't be alarmed, children.
My daughter makes it sound worse than it actually is.
We'll start out very gently.
I'm not sure I understand.
If you mean to apply a new method of upbringing --
Not at all, dear Emilie.
I'm convinced that the children will soon realize how fun it is to perform one's duties conscientiously.
It's all to be like a game.
My children don't care for that sort of game, and neither do I.
Time will tell, dear Emilie.
Let us bring our hands together and thank God for this meal.
Thank you, dear lord, for what we have received, and may we with generous hearts share our abundance with those who hunger and thirst.
Amen.
Justina, please show Fanny and Alexander to the nursery.
It's late and high time for young people to go to rest.
They're coming now.
Into bed, both of you!
Now we'll say our prayers.
Thank you, God, for this day.
Please make me good.
May your angel stay by me through the night.
God bless papa and mama and grandpapa and grand --
And uncle Edvard.
And uncle Edvard, myself and my brothers and sisters and cousins, uncles and aunts,
Vega, ester, Maj, Siri, Berta, Alida, Lisen, and uncle Isak and everybody else.
Amen.
Good night, Alexander.
Justina, I'd like to speak to you about tomorrow.
What's that book you're reading, Alexander?
What's that book you're reading, Alexander?
Good night, my boy.
Good night, my child.
God bless you.
Good night, uncle Edvard.
My dearest wish is for us to live at peace with one another.
Love cannot be commanded, but we can show respect and consideration.
You go ahead, my dear.
I'll come later.
Whose doll house is this?
Fifteen years ago, two little girls lived in this room.
They drowned in the river with their mother.
- Perhaps the house is haunted.
- There are no such things as ghosts.
- Did they live in this room?
- I think this was the nursery.
Good night. Sleep well.
I think we've got a terrible stepfather.
And the sister is crazy.
And that tub of lard that has to be fed.
I don't want to live here.
You have to give me time.
Much has to be changed.
Some things will go quickly, others will take time.
The main thing is not to lose heart.
Why did you marry the Bishop?
Because I love him.
Now let us sleep. Things will seem better when we're not so tired.
Don't play Hamlet, my son.
I'm not queen Gertrude, your kind stepfather isn't the king of Denmark, and this is not Ellsinore castle, even if it does look rather gloomy.
Hell and damnation.
Come, Fanny.
I'll show you something.
The windows are barred.
They can't be opened.
THE FOURTH ACT
EVENTS OF SUMMER
Is that you, old Isak?
How nice of you to call.
No, you're not disturbing me.
I was just sitting with my eyes closed.
Sleeping?
You know I never sleep.
Everyone's abandoned me.
It's the annual excursion to the outer cliffs.
Gustav Adolf doesn't change plans, even if it's raining cats and dogs.
When they left at 10:00, the weather was fine, but clouds have gathered over the mainland.
There's not a soul here.
Won't you come out here for once?
Come now, don't be so stubborn.
You can't sit in your awful shop the whole summer.
You want me to come to you?
I've sat here three days with a sprained ankle.
I was playing hopscotch with Jenny, so I've only myself to blame.
I'm not complaining.
I'm very comfortable.
What did you say?
There's such static on the line,
I can't hear what you're saying.
It's thundering somewhere, but it doesn't seem to be coming this way.
Yes, exactly, my friend.
Actually I'm very worried.
No, we haven't heard anything.
Emilie only told us she'd be staying in town all summer.
This isn't good, Isak.
I feel sick when I think of that big house with its thick walls.
It's no place for children in the summer.
I can't hear a word you're saying.
It's hopeless.
Isak, can you hear me?
You sound very far away.
I'm going to hang up now.
I'll call you back in an hour.
I wonder if it isn't time for a little cognac.
Yes, I think it is.
- Good day, Mrs. Ekdahl.
- Why, it's Maj! How nice.
Come in, dear child.
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
Not at all.
Give me a kiss.
That's nice.
Very pretty.
Did you make it yourself?
Yes.
A pretty pattern.
So you didn't go on the excursion?
No, I wouldn't fit in the boat with my big belly.
Nonsense.
- Is something wrong?
- I'm silly to worry.
Let's sit here.
You're worried about the children?
Alexander and I agreed to write.
I've written seven letters.
And you've received no reply?
One postcard three weeks ago.
"Dear Maj. We are well.
Uncle Edvard took us to..." the botanical gardens.
"We learned about rare flowers."
"Thank you for your letters.
I'll write when I get some time.
Love from Alexander.
Fanny sends her love."
We mustn't underestimate Emilie.
She's perfectly capable of looking after her children.
We're worrying for no reason.
I came to the family before Fanny was born.
They're my children too.
You're going already?
I wanted to speak with you, since I knew you were alone.
Stay a moment.
Thank you for your kindness, but I promised to have dinner ready when they came home.
I haven't put the steak in the oven yet.
Dear child, are things that bad?
Yes.
- Is it the cafe?
- That too.
Has Gustav Adolf been pestering you?
I don't want to hurt him.
He's so kind.
What worries me most is the children.
I'm sorry to be crying.
I'm behaving badly.
Forgive me.
Supper time.
Then you are to go straight to bed.
The tray can be left until tomorrow.
Mrs. Tander sent some cookies for you.
I'll be upset if miss Vergerus finds out I gave these to you.
Hasn't mother returned?
No, your mother has not returned.
She said she'd be back this evening.
Oh, dear,
I don't know what to say.
Why do you keep sighing like that?
I haven't been in this house long, thank goodness... but Mrs. Tander, who's been here since the first wife, could tell you a thing or two.
Would you like a cookie?
- Yes, thank you.
- What does Mrs. Tander say?
That it was the same in the first wife's day.
Only worse.
- Poor children.
- You mean us?
No, I don't mean you.
I mean the poor little ones who found their grave in the dark river outside.
Their mother tried to save them, but she was pulled down by the current.
They found them later by the bridge.
They clung tightly to each other as if they were one big body.
The arms had to be sawn off to get the bodies into separate coffins.
Mrs. Tander says that since then, it has never been quiet in this house.
There are no ghosts.
I don't mean to frighten you... but this house does funny things to you.
Look at my hand.
Skin's been completely ripped off, stripped down to the flesh.
I was taking his grace his coffee.
When I grabbed the doorknob, the skin stuck and ripped off.
Someone laughed behind me.
I heard it clearly and turned around.
But there was no one there.
I feel sorry for anyone who --
I shouldn't chatter on like this.
I'll keep quiet.
I'll close the door now.
Don't worry.
Your mother will probably be back tomorrow, and his grace will personally release you from captivity.
- I've seen them.
- Who?
The woman and the children.
Is that the truth?
Are you telling the truth, Alexander?
Word of honour as a Swedish citizen.
Where did you see them?
I had been in the library with that man who married my mother.
He'd been lecturing me.
I don't remember why.
I was passing through the dining room... and it was unusually bright.
Then I saw a little girl in the doorway.
She ran past me without a sound.
Then I saw the older girl, with the dark hair and big eyes.
She stopped and looked at me and motioned to me to turn around.
And there in the bright sunlight... stood the woman in her black dress.
She said in a faint, almost inaudible voice... not to be afraid, that she had something to tell me.
What did she say?
I don't want to frighten anyone, but these were her very words:
"I want you to know our secret.
Your stepfather, my husband, locked me and my children in the bedchamber.
For five days and nights he kept us without food and water.
In our misery we decided to escape.
We tied sheets together and tried to climb down to the finger of land sticking out into the deep, swirling water.
My daughters went first, but they fell headfirst into the water and were dragged under.
I tried to save them but was sucked down into a black whirlpool that grabbed my clothes.
Underwater I grasped my children's hands and drew them to me."
That's devilish.
Get to bed.
I said get to bed.
What time is it?
His grace has forbidden me to speak to you.
I'll be angry if you don't keep quiet.
Him and his stories!
Did you see that?
- The lightning struck.
- It was nearby.
I hope the damn cathedral went to hell.
What if God punishes you for saying that?
If a big know-it-all like him punishes a runt like me for so little, then he's just the dirty bastard I suspect he is.
Listen, he's playing the flute.
If we concentrate on him dying, then he will.
But we have to start together.
One, two, three:
Die, you devil!
- He's still playing.
- Let's try again.
One, two, three:
Die, you devil!
Mrs. Tander wants to know if your grace will have supper alone.
Tell her I don't want any supper.
A glass of milk and a sandwich in my room will be sufficient.
Thank you, sir.
I'll tell her.
Was there something else?
I don't know.
I don't know how to say it.
It's so unpleasant. It might seem --
Well?
Sir, I can't stand here in the doorway.
Come in, then, and close the door.
You said I was to keep an eye on the children, listen to their conversation and tell you of anything unusual.
Well?
Alexander made up a terrible story.
Really?
It was about --
Oh, it's so awful I don't know how to get it out.
He says you locked your first wife up, and she was drowned with her children when they tried to escape.
- That's all, sir.
- You can go.
Yes, Oscar, that's how it is.
One is old and a child at the same time.
What became of those long years in between that seemed so important at the time?
I sit here growing melancholy, thinking time was all too short.
Your father used to say I was sentimental.
He wasn't known as a particularly sensitive man.
He was both angry and indignant when he died.
He never thought life was cruel or unfair or beautiful.
He just lived and didn't care to comment.
He left that to me.
And when I went on about life, he laughed and called me sentimental.
But I was an artist.
As an artist,
I had a right to be emotional.
Oscar, my dear boy.
I may be worrying for no reason, but when you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, you immediately start worrying.
May I take your hand?
I remember your hand as a child.
It was small and firm and dry.
And your wrist was so awfully slender.
I enjoyed being a mother.
I enjoyed being an actress, too, but I preferred being a mother.
I liked having a big belly, and I didn't give two shakes about the theatre then.
It's all acting anyway.
Some roles are nice, others not so nice.
I played a mother.
I played Juliet and Margareta.
Then suddenly I played a widow or a grandmother.
One role follows the other.
The thing is not to shrink from them.
But what became of it all?
Can you tell me that, my boy?
You're a good boy to listen to your old mother's soliloquies, as Isak calls them.
Yes, you're a good boy, Oscar... and I grieved terribly when you passed away.
That was a strange role to play.
My feelings came from deep in my body.
Even though I could control them... they shattered reality, if you know what I mean.
Reality has remained broken ever since... and, oddly enough, it feels more real that way.
So I don't bother to mend it.
I just don't care anymore if nothing makes sense.
Oscar, my dear boy?
- Yes, mama.
- Are you sad?
I'm worried.
About the children?
Yes.
Get up.
Your stepfather wants to talk to you.
Get dressed.
Your stepfather wants to talk to you.
Hurry up!
Who's there?
It's just me.
Alexander, my boy.
In the presence of your sister and Justina you have accused me of having murdered my wife and children.
What?
Justina, please repeat what you told me.
Alexander said he had seen your first wife and children.
She spoke to him and said that the bishop had locked them all up without food and water.
On the fifth day they tried to escape but drowned in the attempt.
- Do you recognize the story?
- No.
- So Justina has given false testimony?
- She could have dreamt it.
Justina, are you prepared to confirm your statement under oath?
Yes, your grace.
Good, Justina.
Fanny, did you hear Alexander's story?
No.
So you maintain that Justina was either lying or dreaming?
Yes.
Please come here, Alexander.
Are you prepared to swear to it?
Of course.
It's a mortal sin to swear falsely.
It's called perjury and is severely punished.
Really?
Lay your hand on the bible and say after me:
"I, Alexander Ekdahl... swear by holy writ and by the living God... that all I have said, say and will say... is the whole truth and nothing but the truth."
Alexander, my boy.
You remember that the two of us had an important conversation about a year ago.
It concerned certain moral questions.
It wasn't really a conversation.
What do you mean?
The bishop spoke and Alexander said nothing.
And felt ashamed, perhaps, on account of your lies.
I've grown wiser since then.
You mean you lie better.
More or less.
I don't know what you imagine.
Do you think you can besmirch another person's honour with impunity?
Do you think you can lie and get away with perjury without consequence?
Do you think this is a game, Alexander?
Or a play in which the children get to make up their lines?
I think the bishop hates Alexander.
That's what I think.
Oh, so that's what you think.
I'll tell you something that may come as a surprise.
I don't hate you.
I love you.
But the love I feel for you and your mother and sister is not blind and sloppy.
It is strong and harsh.
- Do you hear what I say?
- No.
You're hardening your heart.
Moreover, you misjudge the situation.
- I am much stronger than you are.
- I don't doubt it.
I mean stronger spiritually.
Because I have truth and justice on my side.
I know you'll confess in a little while.
Your confession and punishment will be a relief to you.
You're a wise little man, Alexander.
You realize that the game is up... but you are proud and stubborn... and of course you are ashamed.
I've forgotten what I'm to confess.
Have you now.
What does the bishop want
Alexander to confess?
You know I have means at my disposal.
I didn't, but I do now.
In my childhood, parents were not so soft-hearted.
They had the cane.
I have one too.
It's an ordinary carpet beater, but it can dance a fine step!
If that didn't work, we had other effective means, namely castor oil.
There you see the bottle and a glass.
A few mouthfuls of this and you're more docile.
If that didn't help, there was a dark and cold cubby-hole where you sat for a few hours until the rats started sniffing at your face.
Why must I be punished?
That is obvious, my boy.
You have a weakness in your character.
You can't distinguish lies from truth.
So far they are just child's lies, however dreadful they may be.
But soon you will be a grown man, Alexander, and life punishes liars ruthlessly and indiscriminately.
The punishment is to teach you a love of truth.
I confess I made it up about locking your wife and children in.
- Do you also confess to perjury?
- I suppose so.
Now you've won a great victory.
A victory over yourself.
Which punishment do you choose?
Cane, castor oil or the dark cubby-hole?
- How many strokes of the cane?
- Ten.
Then I choose the cane.
Take two cushions and put them on the table.
Pull your pants down.
Bend over.
Stand up.
- You have something to say to me.
- No.
You must ask my forgiveness.
I won't.
Then I must cane you until you think better of it.
Can't you spare us both that unpleasant experience?
I'll never apologize.
You won't apologize?
No.
Bend over.
No more, please!
Will you ask forgiveness now?
Yes.
Button your pants and blow your nose.
Lend him a handkerchief, Justina.
What do you have to say now?
Alexander asks the bishop for forgiveness.
Speak up.
I want everyone to hear your regret.
Alexander asks the bishop for forgiveness.
For the lies and the perjury.
You do understand that I punished you out of love?
Yes!
Kiss my hand, Alexander.
- May I go to bed now?
- Yes, you may.
But so that you may contemplate the day's events in peace and quiet... you're to sleep in the attic.
Justina will provide a mattress and a blanket.
At 6:00 in the morning you will be let out.
Understood?
Yes, your grace!
Helena, it's hardest on the children.
They're punished for the slightest misdeed.
His mother locks them up, puts them to bed in the middle of the day.
A week ago,
Fanny refused to finish her porridge.
She had to sit there all night.
She threw up on the plate.
At last she finished it.
He's mad with jealousy but doesn't realize it's mutual.
My poor Emilie.
How could I be so blind?
How could I feel compassion for that man?
I'm an actress.
I should have seen through his pretence.
But I had lived practically alone since Fanny was born.
I hated my occasional emotional storms.
Oscar was my best friend.
You know that, Helena.
You know how fond I was of him, how sincere my grief was when he left us.
I don't blame you for anything.
I saw nothing, understood nothing.
He spoke to me of another life.
A life of demands, of purity, of joy in the performance of duty.
I'd never heard such words.
There seemed to be a light around him when he spoke to me.
At the same time,
I could tell he was lonely, unhappy... haunted by fear and bad dreams.
He assured me I would save him.
He said together with the children we'd live in nearness to God.
In the truth.
The truth
- that was the most important part.
I was so thirsty.
I know it sounds dramatic and overstrung, Helena... but I thirsted for truth and felt I'd been living a lie.
I must go.
A carriage is waiting at the gate.
I'm afraid something might have happened while I've been here.
I'm in constant fear that Alexander will say something to displease him.
Alexander is so foolhardy.
I've tried to warn him, but he can't see that his stepfather is a dangerous opponent who's just waiting for the right opportunity to crush him.
You must leave him, Emilie.
I'm pregnant.
Nevertheless, you must --
Forgive me for interrupting.
I've asked him for a divorce.
He refuses.
I tell him that I'll leave just the same.
Then he explains in detail what will happen.
In a court of law,
I'll lose on grounds of "desertion," as it's called.
The children will be taken from me, to be brought up by him.
I've written in secret to a friend of mine who's a lawyer.
He's confirmed what Edvard says.
I am shut in and can no longer breathe.
I'm dying, Helena!
I hate that man so violently that I could --
Don't mention that I've been here.
To anybody.
Mother.
Father.
If you're coming to visit... please remember I'm scared of ghosts... and that you're actually dead.
Don't sneak up on me from behind.
I might go mad from fear.
You wouldn't want that, right?
I don't understand why I always have to see dead people when it makes me sick.
Damn it!
Ah, hell!
My name's Pauline.
My sister Esmeralda is over by the crucifix.
- She's mad at you, Alexander.
- Why?
She wants us to punish you.
Why do you look so surprised?
- You know very well why we're mad.
- No, I don't.
You lied about our father.
You said he locked us up.
That's not true.
The floodgates had been closed for several weeks, and the river had frozen over.
We'd gotten new skates for Christmas.
But the ice broke, and we fell into the water.
Mother tried to save us, but the current dragged us under the ice.
Now you know the truth, wretched boy.
My sister and I thought we'd free our father from you and your hatred.
We'll scare the wits out of you so you end up in the hospital, locked in a cell, chained hand and foot.
Please, don't frighten me!
- Give me the key!
- Edvard has forbidden it.
Give me the key now!
Edvard has forbidden it!
You're hurting me!
Emilie, you can't!
Carl, don't forget the cognac.
There's none left.
Take your damn paint box!
Listen to me.
I told you, there's none left.
- Alma, we're to go up to see grandmama.
- What are you shouting about?
I'm just shouting!
Punch will do just as well!
The old girl's not here.
She's probably in the dining room.
Good evening, mama.
We came to see how you are.
I'm splendid.
I hope you aren't lonely.
Lonely?
I love being alone.
Vega was bitten by a wasp.
A wasp stings, my dear.
It has a stinger just like your old man.
Don't pinch me.
And Petra fell in the lake and got soaked.
Where shall I serve supper?
I don't want any.
- How's the wasp sting?
- Not worth talking about.
And mama is busy with the old man's photographs.
How many thousands have you sorted by now?
Here's one of you and your brothers.
You couldn't have been more than five years old.
- You can already tell which brother...
- Who is this beautiful woman?
Did it rain on you the whole time?
No, not at all, dearest mama.
Not a cloud over the outer islands, but we saw the rain over the mainland, and heard the thunder it's rained all day here.
This woman with the low neckline was one of papa's lady friends.
You're mistaken.
We were at school together.
She married a count, had 12 children and became as big as a house.
I always admired your skilful way of handling papa's little adventures.
We must be going.
Mr. Ohman and his lovely wife are going to stop by.
I'm going into town tomorrow.
Anything I can do for you?
Thank you, Gusten.
I don't need anything.
But I'd like to talk to you about Maj.
What the hell is it now?
She's got it good.
Now I'm damned angry
- if you'll excuse me, mama.
Calm down, Gusten!
He loses his temper at the mention of Maj's name.
I just want to say --
You have to realize Maj is not your private plaything.
Thanks to alma's broad-mindedness, she's a member of our family, and she's expecting my grandchild.
In your dictatorial way, you've decided her future.
I don't give a damn --
I don't like it when you swear in your mother's presence.
You hear me, Gusten?
I like the girl.
I wish her well.
I want to ensure her future.
I don't want her to be dependent on the family's benevolence if I die.
She's accepted my suggestions.
She doesn't need any protectors, especially against me.
Stop your twaddle!
Don't make me out as a dictator!
Maj has decided it all herself!
I like her.
I'm kind to her.
Alma's kind to her.
Now I'm hurt, let me tell you.
Damned hurt!
There's no reason to side with Maj against me!
I'm fond of her.
Alma's fond of her.
She is loved in the same way as Jenny,
Petra and Putte.
Well, not exactly in the same way, but almost.
She's good to me.
She doesn't think I'm fat and old and disgusting.
Nobody thinks that, by the --
I've a soft spot for the ladies.
What's to be done about it?
That's nothing to giggle at.
Maj is to go her own way through life, and I'm going to give her solid ground to stand on.
That's enough said about that.
The opera singer said he would stop by with his wife and children. Come now.
Good-bye, mama.
Give me a kiss.
I don't want you and alma to sit gossiping about Maj's future.
I'll see to that!
Or rather, she will.
Good night, mama.
Come, alma.
- I'll be back in a couple of hours.
- Like hell you will! Come on!
Calm down or you'll have a stroke.
I am calm.
You're the one who's shouting.
I want an end to all that gossip between you and mama!
Carlchen, you can't demand that I ask her.
Mama distrusts me and it's your fault.
Therefore I can't ask her.
I don't see how I can say anything.
- Tell her I'm desperate.
- You can tell her better yourself.
Make it clear I've been contemplating suicide.
Is that really true?
We can be poor together.
I will to work.
Idiot. Bonehead. Fool.
"I will work."
I'm sorry. I will work.
What do you want me to say, mein Carlchen?
Don't you have any imagination, you imbecile?
Say I look unhappy, that I've stopped eating, that I lie awake at night.
Yes, you do lie awake with insomnia.
It damn well is insomnia!
Say that I've grown quiet, that I never laugh, and when I do, it sounds dreadful. Understand?
Don't just come right out with it, damn it.
Lead her to suspect I've spoken of suicide.
Don't say that terrible word, or I'll start crying.
Stupid slut.
Do you think of suicide, mein Schatz?
Only when I look at you.
Why are you so cruel?
Don't go, Goddamn it!
Where are you going?
Why the hell are you leaving?
I won't talk to your mother.
I'm going home.
Du bist bose.
I have to cry.
You don't understand that I love you.
Now I'm crying, and I won't be able to stop.
Dear God, my creator, why must I go on acting in this wretched farce?
Lydia, stop!
Let me help you.
Oh, Goddamn it!
Just look at this.
Pick up your shawl.
Damn it all! My leg!
Grandma.
- Shouldn't you be in bed?
- We sneaked out.
What will your mother say?
She won't find out.
Unless grandma tattles, of course.
What do you want from your old grandma?
Welcome home, Emilie.
You were gone a long time.
We almost began to worry.
Mrs. Tander wonders if you'd like something to eat.
I'm not hungry.
I'll let her know.
- Will you be coming to bed soon?
- When the children are asleep.
I'll be reading in the library.
Please don't be long.
Good night, children.
We had actually decided
Alexander would sleep in the attic tonight.
But I understand that decision has changed.
Yes, it has.
Very well.
Perhaps it's best.
- Good night, Fanny.
- Good night, uncle Edvard.
Good night, Alexander.
Is he asleep?
No, I'm not.
Then you can also answer me when I bid you good night.
I can't.
You can't?
What nonsense is that?
Alexander doesn't wish the bishop a good night.
You have a sense of humour.
I like that.
Well, did you see your mother-in-law and relatives?
Was it a nice visit?
Did it rain?
It rained and thundered here all day.
Well, a little moisture's good, at least for the farmers.
Alexander and I had a little review this afternoon.
The usual:
He couldn't distinguish fantasy from reality.
But we clarified the concepts.
He's not stupid, that Alexander.
He's not stupid, but he's very unforgiving.
"Alexander doesn't wish the bishop a good night."
That's really priceless.
You're not saying anything.
Are you mad about something?
You locked up the children.
A safety measure, Emilie.
I wanted to guarantee you would return.
You abused Alexander.
You're so dramatic.
I punished him.
That's my duty as his guardian.
Besides, the punishment was mild in comparison to the offence.
He's bleeding, and the skin is broken.
I gave him a few lashes.
His buttocks will sting for a few days, but it's a healthy sting.
He'll think twice before fabricating new lies, or fantasies, if that's the term you prefer.
And the humiliation?
Punishment given out of love can never be humiliating in the deeper sense.
Love and respect have nothing in common, and the language of love... can be rather harsh.
You're one to speak of love.
You allow yourself to be contemptuous.
Shall we end this conversation and go to bed?
You locked him in the attic.
Of course.
He needed to be alone.
You know he's afraid of the dark.
The nights are bright this time of year, and those with a clear conscience have nothing to fear.
I could kill you.
You'll harm the baby with thoughts like that.
Our baby will never be born.
Be careful of what you say.
You don't frighten me.
I must frighten you, Emilie.
But I do so with a heavy heart, since I love you in spite of everything.
You're not strong, Emilie.
The pregnancy is draining your strength.
From now on you'll stay in a room that we'll make as comfortable as possible.
Henrietta and my mother will take turns looking after you.
For the time being, your freedom will be somewhat limited.
But we must be very careful.
You should also know that the slightest attempt to rebel or contact the outside world will affect your children's welfare.
By being irresponsible, you've forced me to take responsibility, not only for your children, but also for you.
It's a heavy burden.
I feel a terrible loneliness.
I'm an ordinary man with great faults, but I exercise a powerful office that always overshadows the person holding it.
A man becomes a slave to such an office, with no right to opinions of his own.
THE FIFTH ACT
DEMONS
Good day, Mr. Jacobi.
Good day,
Miss Vergerus.
What is it?
Is His Grace --
He is not to be disturbed.
May I speak to his wife?
She is indisposed, resting in her room --
And not to be disturbed.
My mother is out and I am busy.
His Grace might be annoyed if --
What is this concerning?
Some months ago,
His Grace proposed a business deal.
Really? I don't recall.
Of course not, miss Vergerus.
His grace is careful to spare his family such trivial worries.
What worries of his could concern you?
Please don't force me to be vulgar.
To be candid, Mr. Jacobi,
I find you unpleasant.
I've neither the time nor the inclination to speak with you.
- Good-bye, Mr. Jacobi.
- A pecuniary predicament.
I beg your pardon?
Your brother, His Grace, was in a pecuniary predicament.
- May I sit down?
- Not there! There.
In a peculiar way
- I don't know why -
I appreciate your straightforwardness.
And I do not appreciate your fawning.
What business do you have with my brother?
None at all, as far as I know.
I'm tired of your riddles.
Tell me what's on your mind and go.
I must speak to His Grace first.
It's a matter of money.
A lot of money.
Does my brother owe you money?
On the contrary.
It's like this:
In November His Grace wanted to borrow money.
Regrettably, Jews have certain principles, like never lending money to the clergy.
He suggested I should buy that chest for a reasonable sum.
I declined.
So you declined.
Foolishly so, since I've now changed my mind.
I'd like to buy that chest, and at almost any price.
Almost.
I will get my brother.
I told you not to disturb me.
Mr. Jacobi wants to buy the chest.
That man hangs on like vermin!
Stay where you are.
I'll come get you in a few minutes.
Take your shoes off.
Forgive an old man's unfortunate weakness, your grace.
- You wish to buy the chest?
- Yes.
For how much?
Here is the sum.
It seems you've changed your mind.
I may have an interested buyer.
- I'm being cheated, of course.
- You're free to say no.
- Do you have you the money with you?
- The money?
The money!
Of course, your grace.
I have large bills right here.
Let me see.
Yes, here they are.
- Give me the money.
- Of course.
If I may have your grace's name on the contract?
Forgive me if I retire.
I shall miss you, miss Vergerus.
Do not take anything that is not your due.
Suspicions recoil on those who harbour them.
Your grace will want to ensure that
I'm not taking more than my due.
That's quite all right.
I just wanted to return the signed contract.
Please have a seat.
What would you say about that painting?
A beautiful and valuable work.
Would it interest you?
My resources are regrettably a bit strained at present.
- How is your wife?
- It's kind of you to inquire.
She is indisposed.
This sudden heat disagrees with her.
- May I pay my respects?
- Unfortunately not.
I understand.
Here is a letter for her from old Mrs. Ekdahl.
- I shall give it to her.
- You're too kind.
Filthy Jewish swine!
You damned, filthy Jewish swine!
You thought you could cheat me.
You'll regret this, you repulsive, hook-nosed bastard!
Calm down!
That swine is trying to steal my children!
He can't.
I have the key to the nursery.
Don't touch them!
Come on, quickly!
Come here.
First and foremost, let's have something to eat.
This is my nephew, Aron.
Let's go to the table.
I'd like to sleep.
Our guests are tired.
Have you tidied the room and made the beds?
I've done all you asked, uncle.
This is Aron's puppet theatre.
If you ask him nicely, he may give a performance.
Behind this door lives my nephew Ismael.
He's sick.
The door must always be kept shut.
Remember that, both of you.
Sometimes he sings, even at night.
It's nothing to worry about.
You'll get used to it.
Mind the steps, Fanny, so you don't trip.
Now down this hallway.
It's a bit cold and damp, because we don't dare light a fire or open the windows.
Straight ahead, and then through that little door.
It's not so unusual.
This will be your home for the time being.
I hope you'll like it.
Go to bed now.
Good night, Fanny.
Good night, Alexander.
Lock the door at night and don't open it for anyone.
- Don't forget to say your prayers.
- Don't go.
You want me to stay?
Then I'll sit here.
I'll go and see to Ismael.
My name is Aron.
Ismael is my brother.
Our parents died when we were small.
Good night.
What kind of book is that?
It's a book of stories, thoughts, words of wisdom and prayers.
It's written in Hebrew.
You understand that language?
- Shall I read you something?
- Yes, please.
Uncle Isak?
Are you sure His Grace can't come and get us?
You can put your mind at ease.
Come on, read.
It may be a bit choppy, since I have to translate.
A young man journeys down an endless road in the company of many others.
The road leads across a rocky plain where nothing grows.
The sun's fire burns from morning to evening.
They can't find shade or coolness anywhere.
A harrowing wind stirs up huge dust clouds.
The youth is driven forward by an incomprehensible anxiety... and tormented by a scorching thirst.
Sometimes he asks himself or one of his travelling companions about the goal of their pilgrimage.
But the answer is uncertain and tentative.
He himself has forgotten why he ever set out on his journey.
He's also forgotten his native land... and the journey's final destination.
Suddenly, one evening he finds himself standing in a forest.
Dusk sets in and all is quiet.
Perhaps the evening wind sighs through the tall trees.
He stands amazed... but also anxious and suspicious.
He's all alone... and he discovers his hearing is weak, since his ears are inflamed from the merciless light of day.
His mouth and throat are parched from the long pilgrimage.
His lips are cracked, pressed together around curses and harsh words.
So he doesn't hear the ripple of flowing water and doesn't notice its reflection in the dusk.
He stands deaf and blind at the edge of the spring... unaware of its existence.
Like a sleepwalker he wanders unaware between the sparkling pools.
His blind skill is remarkable, and soon he's back onto the road... in the burning, shadowless light.
One night by the camp fire he's seated near an old man who's telling some children about the forests and springs.
The youth recalls what he's been through, but faintly and indistinctly... as in a dream.
He turns to the old man, sceptical yet courteous, and asks,
"where does all this water come from?"
"It comes from a mountain whose peak is covered by a mighty cloud."
"What kind of cloud?" the youth asks.
The old man answers,
"every man carries within him hopes, fears and longings.
Every man shouts out his despair or bears it in his mind.
Some pray to a particular God.
Others address their cries to the void.
This despair, this hope... this dream of deliverance, all these cries, all these tears are gathered over thousands and thousands of years... and condense into an immeasurable cloud around a high mountain.
Out of the cloud rain flows down the mountain... forming the streams and rivers that flow through the great forests.
That's how the springs are formed where you can quench your thirst... wash your badly burnt face... cool your blistered feet.
Everybody has at some time heard of the mountain, the cloud and the springs... but most people anxiously remain on the dusty road in the blazing light."
"Why do they stay there?"
Asks the youth in great astonishment.
"I certainly don't know," replies the old man.
"Perhaps they've convinced themselves and each other that they'll reach their unknown destination by evening."
"What unknown destination?"
Asks the young man.
The old man shrugs his shoulders.
"In all probability the destination does not exist.
It's deception or imagination.
I myself am on my way to the forests and the springs.
I was there once when I was young... and now I'm trying to find my way back.
It's not easy, let me tell you."
The next morning the youth set out with the old man to seek the mountain, the cloud, the forests and the rippling springs.
Shall we have a seat?
- May I tempt you with a glass of sherry?
- No, thank you.
No.
- An almond cookie? My sister's specialty.
- No, thank you.
Not that either.
I want the children back.
This is a small town, and tongues will soon be wagging.
I fear you've misunderstood the reason for our visit.
We're here on behalf of the family to ask that you set Emilie and the children free.
We can't say with certainty that we know what has occurred.
We only know that our dear
Emilie is extremely unhappy and that the children hate the Bishop's palace.
We certainly understand that divorce is a painful step for a highly placed servant of the church, and we'd like to make appropriate compensation for your painful loss.
I've spoken with my mother, and we're ready to place a considerable sum at your disposal, which you may, of course, use... for charity, a foundation, or some other purpose close to your heart.
We agree that everything must be handled with utmost discretion, and my mother is willing to take
Emilie and the children to Italy and remain there for at least a year.
Let me first say that I fully appreciate the respect and generosity the Ekdahls extend to me in this difficult hour.
At the same time, it's necessary, though painful, for me to speak very clearly.
The children have been abducted from their home.
They must unconditionally and without delay be returned to their legal parents.
Every delay will cause all of us - not least their mother - unspeakable suffering.
When the children are returned,
I'll be prepared to listen to any proposals the Ekdahl family may have.
But to avoid any further misunderstandings...
I must make it clear that a divorce... is absolutely out of the question.
I'm very grateful for your precise and clear standpoint.
But I'm obliged to mention that the children will never... be returned to the Bishop's palace to be subjected to the suffering that up till now has befallen them.
Perhaps I should add that on this point the Ekdahls are in complete agreement.
The matter is therefore not open to discussion.
The children are part of our family, and we therefore consider ourselves responsible for their well-being... and development.
It grieves me... that the Ekdahl family should be dictating conditions.
Especially since, as their stepfather,
I have the law on my side.
And furthermore, as a representative of the church,
I have the moral advantage.
But we have the children, my dear brother.
I'm glad you're able to laugh in this awkward situation.
Perhaps legal proceedings and police action will be unavoidable.
I doubt it, my dear Edvard.
You'd rather shit in your pants than suffer the disgrace of the parish hags whistling through their false teeth.
You may well have morality and the law on your side, old man, but bear in mind that I'm in league with immorality, and even were you to win in court, we who side with immorality will have spread so many credible rumours about your person, your way of life, your household, your sister, your servants, your sanity, your sexual excesses, your phoney hair, your hypocrisy, your hypochondria, and your lack of decency that you'll be forever forced to preach to Huguenots, hooligans and Eskimos!
I'm not saying this to frighten you, my esteemed friend.
I only wish to lay all the cards on the table.
So let me see you listen to reason.
If you have any, that is.
Your clownish antics are amusing.
I'd be inclined to laugh if your babble didn't contain what I would call a real and material threat.
Let me tell you something, my fine lord Bishop, something you might not understand.
I can see through you.
You're a cad of monumental proportions!
Shut up, Gustav Adolf!
Think of your blood pressure!
I must apologize, my dear Edvard.
Even if we have differing views in what seems to be an irresolvable conflict, we must behave like civilized beings.
I disassociate myself entirely from
Gustav Adolf's expressions and attitudes and assure you that he represents no one but himself.
He certainly does not voice the family's opinion.
My esteemed brother must forgive me.
A thousand apologies.
I'm a boor
- at least that's what my wife says.
I have no eye for people's inner qualities.
I drink too much.
I'm embarrassed. I apologize.
We'll say no more about it.
I'm prepared to listen to an honest man's honest opinion, even if he is a bit... brusque.
A glass of sherry?
I assure you it's quite good.
Thank you very much.
I'm awfully sorry.
I'm so fond of that silly Emilie, that silly little creature.
We love her. The whole family loves her.
Isn't that so, Carl?
And when our brother Oscar died, we didn't care for her sufficiently.
We have much to blame ourselves for.
One can be so damned slack and self-centred.
I said that to Alma this morning.
If we hadn't been so slack and self-centred, this would never have --
I don't think we can reach an agreement under present circumstances.
Let us consider our confidential and frank conversation as a cautious exploration.
I fear I do not share your cautious optimism.
I consider our negotiations terminated... and feel compelled to make my standpoint quite clear.
The children must be returned to their home within 12 hours.
Otherwise I'll be forced, though it conflicts with my principles, to report the matter to the police and the public prosecutor.
Is it conceivable that if the children were returned, we could begin informal talks about their future relations with us?
I'm a believer in firm rules and principles... a fact that in no way conflicts with my sincere and passionate love of freedom.
May I understand your statement as an indirect promise of future discussions regarding the sensitive question of Emilie's and the children's freedom of movement?
Disintegration in our lives... is due in large part to broken ties between people... who otherwise have the capacity to respect and love each other.
A cruel and incomprehensible mystery.
To think that a man like me, almost 220 pounds, with a fully grown beard and a developed mind... should have to sit here on this silly, uncomfortable chair and listen to this unmitigated hypocrite.
"Disintegration in our lives!"
Kiss me where my back changes its name!
You shut up, Carl.
Shut up!
While I tell this spiritual masturbator what we have up our sleeves.
Listen to me!
I'll tell you something,
Edvard Vergerus.
I've acquired your promissory notes.
You didn't know that, did you?
Yes, my friend.
110,000 kronor in debts.
So I'll be dictating conditions now.
Turning pale now, are you?
The holy man's looking pale, eh, Carl?
I'd say his nose even grew a bit too.
You're a special kind of bully,
Edvard Vergerus.
One thing I've learned in my profession is to recognize the smell of a bully, even if he wears a cassock.
And I know how bullies should be treated.
They must be bullied!
Emilie is to have her divorce, or I'll declare his holiness bankrupt!
Idiot.
What?
I said idiot.
You're an idiot.
I thought it honourable to tell him he doesn't have a chance.
I get so tired of you sometimes,
Gustav Adolf.
Really?
What stupid thing have I done now?
You'll soon see.
A moment ago we spoke of the advantage of putting our cards on the table.
I beg to return to that metaphor shortly.
To Mr. Ekdahl I'd like to say... that I pity him.
He has a poor opinion of the world and a simplistic view of people.
He suffers from the widespread misconception that man is ruled by his needs.
He believes that everything can be bought and sold.
Mr. Ekdahl is the son of one of the country's greatest artists.
Despite this he has grasped little or nothing... of the spirit's unlimited power over matter.
He is a wretched caliban, groping with clumsy hands for his dull tools.
I pity him and feel sincere compassion for him.
My esteemed Carl, I thank you for a respectful and dignified conversation.
I regret we have not come to an agreement.
Try sometime to tell your brother --
No, he would never understand... that there are people who have no needs... who are indifferent to money... who dismiss the world's luxuries, who happily allow themselves to be slandered because their conscience is clear before God the almighty.
Now, to return to our game of cards, which Mr. Ekdahl spoke of so wittily.
Allow me to play the last card.
Excuse me for a moment.
That man is the devil himself!
Have you ever seen such a cold-blooded scoundrel?
If you hadn't behaved like an idiot.
I admit it, and I'm sick about it.
No, that's not the word.
I'm terribly sorry.
- Be quiet, he's coming. Shut up!
- I'll shut up.
Dear, dear Gustav Adolf.
Dear Carl.
I can't begin to express my gratitude for your care and affection, but unfortunately you've misunderstood.
Isak Jacobi took it upon himself to abduct the children.
It's terrible and unbelievable.
It's nice and safe here.
Edvard is good to us, and we're very happy.
I implore you with all my heart to bring back my children.
It's true that I've been anxious and unhappy.
It's true that I went and talked to Helena.
It's true the children had difficulty adjusting to their new surroundings.
It's true we live a stricter and more serious life than at home.
But I'm happy and safe.
Edvard is goodness itself.
You must believe me.
I implore you with all my heart:
Bring back my children!
I cannot live without them!
Dear friends, do as I say.
It's all a terrible misunderstanding.
Farewell, gentlemen.
I have to pee.
Damn, there's no chamber pot.
It won't be easy to find the toilet in the dark.
I hope there aren't any ghosts.
Damn, I think I've lost my way.
Now I'm lost for sure.
It's not my fault it's all gone wrong.
I can't leave you.
I just can't.
It would be better if you'd take off for heaven.
You can't help us anyway.
I lived my whole life with you children and Emilie.
Death makes no difference.
What is it, Alexander?
Why can't you go to God and tell him to kill the Bishop?
Or doesn't God give a damn about you, or any of us?
Have you even seen God on the other side?
Not a bastard has a thought in his head.
Idiots, the whole bunch of 'em.
You must be gentle with people.
Aren't you coming to bed?
The clock has struck 4:00.
I can't sleep.
Neither can I.
Elsa's very sick.
We ought to send for the doctor.
He's coming in the morning.
- What are you drinking?
- Hot broth.
- It helps against insomnia.
- May I?
Be my guest.
Can't you forgive me?
I'm staying with you, aren't I?
I don't understand this sudden yielding.
Drink while it's hot.
- You insist that the children return?
- Yes.
In that case, it's hopeless.
I don't care if it's hopeless.
I care only for what is right.
Isn't that Elsa calling?
Stay here. I'll see to her.
Can I help you, aunt?
It's so dark.
What time is it?
Almost half past 4:00.
It's been a long night.
Try to get some sleep.
My legs hurt.
They're swollen and aching.
I've heard the universe is expanding.
Heavenly bodies are hurtling away from each other at a bewildering rate.
The universe is exploding, and we find ourselves at the very moment of explosion.
You once said you were always changing masks... until finally you didn't know who you were.
I have only one mask.
But it's branded into my flesh.
If I tried to tear it off --
I always thought people liked me.
I saw myself as wise, broad-minded and fair.
I had no idea... that anyone could hate me.
I don't hate you.
No, but your son does.
I'm afraid of him.
Who's behind the door?
It is God behind the door.
- Can't you come out?
- No living being may see God's face.
- What do you want?
- To prove that I exist.
This is the end of me.
Shall I show myself?
Now you will see me.
Here I come, Alexander.
- Admit you were scared.
- I wasn't a damned bit scared.
"This is the end of me."
Ouch! That hurts.
Don't cry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
At least not that much.
I've been working all night on this puppet.
A rich circus owner in England is mad about our puppets.
I heard you tiptoeing around.
Hear that?
My brother Ismael is awake.
He's singing.
Poor Ismael.
Human beings are more than he can bear.
Sometimes he gets furious.
Then he's dangerous.
Doctors say his intelligence is light-years beyond normal.
He reads continuously.
He's incredibly learned and knows everything by heart.
You said you'd been up all night, but I saw you asleep.
There are many strange things that can't be explained.
You realize that when you dabble in magic.
- Have you seen our mummy?
- No.
Come.
Look carefully, Alexander.
Can you see it breathing?
It's been dead 4,000 years, but it breathes.
I'll make the room dark.
- What do you see?
- It's shining.
Exactly.
No one knows why it's luminous.
No one can explain why.
The unknown makes people angry.
It's better to blame it on mirrors, machines and projections.
Then people laugh, and that's healthier from all viewpoints, especially financially.
Watch carefully now.
My father and mother ran a magic theatre in St. Petersburg.
One evening, in the middle of a performance... a real ghost appeared.
It was my father's aunt, who had died two days earlier.
The ghost lost her way among the machines and projectors.
It was a fiasco, and father had to refund the tickets.
- I know quite a bit about ghosts.
- Do you?
Uncle Isak says we're surrounded by different realities, one on top of the other.
There are swarms of ghosts, spirits, phantoms, souls, poltergeists, angels and demons.
He says the smallest pebble has a life of its own.
- More coffee?
- Yes, please.
Everything is alive, and everything is God or God's thought.
Not only good things, but the cruellest too.
What do you think?
If there is a God, then he's a shit, and I'd like to kick him in the butt.
Your theory is very interesting and appears to be justified.
Shall we take Ismael his breakfast?
For my part,
I'm an atheist.
If you've been raised as a magician and learned all the tricks since childhood, then you can do without supernatural interference.
As a magician,
I create the believable.
The audience provides the unbelievable.
You're definitely no idiot, Alexander, especially considering you're only nine.
- I'll be eleven in November.
- Here.
I've brought your breakfast.
Your sister gave me sleeping pills for my insomnia.
I had put three in the broth.
I didn't mean for you to drink it.
When you went to see Elsa,
I put in three more.
You will sleep soundly.
When you wake up,
I will be gone.
I'm going back to my children... to my home... and my family.
I'll change and you'll come back.
I'll never come back!
I'll poison your life!
I'll follow you from town to town!
I'll ruin your children's future!
Poor Edvard, you don't know what you're saying!
I am awake!
I'm horribly awake.
Help me into bed at least.
I can't see anymore... and I feel dizzy.
Are you there?
I can't see.
Ismael, I've brought your breakfast.
Good morning, Ismael.
This is Alexander Ekdahl, a friend.
Leave us alone, Aron.
Don't worry.
I won't eat him... even if he does look appetizing.
You can come back in half an hour.
- Go now, Aron.
- Uncle Isak...
Uncle Isak is an old goat and needn't know of Alexander's visit.
Go now.
No, thank you.
My name is Ismael, but you already know that.
"And he will be a wild man.
His hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him."
I'm considered dangerous.
That's why I'm locked up.
Dangerous in what way?
Write your name here.
The pencil's pretty dull, but it should still serve.
There, Alexander Ekdahl.
Now read what you've written.
It says "Ismael Retzinsky."
Perhaps we're the same person, with no boundaries.
Perhaps we flow through each other, stream through each other boundlessly and magnificently.
You bear such terrible thoughts... it's almost painful to be near you.
Yet it's also enticing.
- Do you know why?
- I don't think I want to know.
You've heard of making an image of someone you dislike and sticking pins in it?
It's a rather clumsy method when you think of the swift paths an evil thought can travel.
You're a strange little person.
You won't speak of that which is constantly in your thoughts.
You're thinking of a man's death.
Wait a moment.
I know who you're thinking of:
A tall man with fair, greying hair.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
He has clear blue eyes and a boyish face.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
He's asleep and dreams he's kneeling at the altar.
Above the altar hangs the crucified prophet.
In his dream he gets up and cries out,
"my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
There is no answer, not even a laugh.
Don't talk like that.
It is not I talking.
It is yourself.
You are not to hesitate.
He's sound asleep, plagued by nightmares.
Give me your hands.
It isn't really necessary, but it's safer.
The doors will be thrown open.
A scream will echo through the house.
- I don't want to.
- It's too late.
You have only one way to go, and I am with you.
I obliterate myself.
I merge into you, my child.
Don't be afraid.
I am with you.
I'm your guardian angel.
It is 5:00 in the morning, and the sun has just risen.
The doors are thrown open.
No, wait.
First a horrible scream echoes through the house.
A shapeless burning figure moves across the floor, screaming.
I don't want to.
Let me go! Let me go!
The police are here and insist on speaking to you.
Honoured, Mrs. Vergerus.
It is my painful duty, as the town's ranking administrator of justice, to have to inform you of the terrible circumstances surrounding your husband's horrible death.
Furthermore, according to the law of the land, and in the presence of this witness, chief inspector Jespersson,
I must conduct a short and,
I assure you, in all respects formal interrogation, for which I beg your forgiveness.
Your husband,
His Grace the Bishop, lost his life this morning under terrible circumstances.
May I, madam?
We think we've been able to determine the course of events.
Miss Elsa Bergius, who was gravely ill, lay in bed.
On her bedside table stood a lamp.
By some unfortunate accident, the lamp fell on the bed igniting her nightgown, hair and bed linens.
Blazing like a torch, she ran through the house and by chance made it into the Bishop's bedchamber.
According to His Grace's sister, miss Henrietta Vergerus, he was in a heavy sleep from a soporific you had given him earlier that night.
After a heated quarrel with your husband, you left the house at 4:20 a.m.
Miss Bergius flung herself on him, igniting his bedclothes and nightshirt.
His grace woke up and succeeded in freeing himself from the dying woman who was still ablaze.
But he could not extinguish the flames that were now engulfing him.
Old Mrs. Vergerus found her son with his body burnt and face charred.
He showed faint signs of life and said he was in unbearable agony.
Ten minutes later, the doctor and ambulance arrived on the scene, but by then His Grace had already been released from his suffering and had taken his last breath.
Although I can't overlook the fact that the sleeping aid you gave him possibly made the disaster worse,
I also cannot attach any serious importance to it.
Therefore, I must characterize the event as an ill-fated coincidence of extremely unfortunate circumstances.
Therefore I beg to extend to you my deepest, most sincere condolences.
Come, Jespersson.
Madame, I had the honour to wait upon you yesterday, but your maid showed me the door with an offensive message.
Monsieur le marquis,
I blush at your presumption and can only deplore the fact that my servants this morning were unable to show you the door once again.
You say that you love me, sir.
In that case, be so kind as to spare me your presence, because, frankly, it does me only harm, not to mention the anger over the embarrassment you caused me in the presence of her Majesty the queen.
Marquis, to what do we owe the honour of such an early visit?
- Count!
- Marquis!
Only the thought of the blood you have shed for your king, sir, prevents me from instantly and with all my power throwing back in your face...
The infamy you have committed against the marquise --
The infamy you have committed against the marquise.
It's not enough this is the worst rubbish ever written in the French language.
In addition, the translation is terrible,
Mr. Landahl.
I'm telling you honestly, even though
I know you've gone to great trouble.
I know it was done in haste,
Mr. Morsing, but we find ourselves in a crisis.
In the past we performed
Shakespeare and the great Moliere.
We were even so bold as to let
Henrik Ibsen's voice be heard.
Public taste, Mr. Morsing.
They no longer wish to hear the songs of giants.
They're content with the tunes of dwarfs.
No one cares about our theatre, neither the public nor the Ekdahl family.
Funds are running dry.
Our actors fare badly.
Hanna.
Emilie dear.
Now you'll stay with us, won't you?
I don't know why I'm so damned moved.
Dear Mrs. Ekdahl.
I'm at a loss for words.
Now everything will be right again.
Dearest Emilie.
Welcome back.
Thank you.
My dear, dear friends.
I am more moved than I can say.
Dear friends... dearest mama... my most beloved wife, Alma... my darling Emilie, more beautiful than ever.
My wonderful children, Petra,
Jenny and Putte, and little miss Helena Viktoria, lying so peacefully in her bed.
And dear Maj... of whom I'm very fond.
And not forgetting my incomparable brother Carl, and his sweet wife.
My most honoured friend,
Isak Jacobi, who has rendered immeasurable service to this family.
Dear Vega and Ester, and you good friends who faithfully help us up the hill of life.
Last, but not least dear and admired, greatly talented and brilliant artists, if I could I would encompass you all in one big embrace and plant a kiss on your brows.
A kiss which, more than words, would tell you of my happiness and love.
Cheers, everyone!
Just imagine:
We're all together again!
Our little world has closed around us in safety, wisdom and order.
After a period of fear and confusion... death's shadows have been routed, winter has been put to flight, and joy has returned to our hearts.
Now I must have a look at little Helena Viktoria.
She's laughing at me, my daughter Helena Viktoria.
Now for a speech.
Go on, laugh at your old father.
Never mind what he says.
It's only nonsense.
My wisdom is simple.
There are those who despise it, but I don't give a damn --
Forgive me, mama.
I noticed you raised your right eyebrow.
You think your son is talking too much.
Don't worry. I will be brief.
Therefore... and consequently... we Ekdahls have not come into the world to see through it.
Never think that.
We are not equipped for such excursions.
We might just as well ignore the big things.
We must live in the little world.
We will be content with that and cultivate it and make the best of it.
Suddenly death strikes.
Suddenly the abyss opens.
Suddenly the storm howls, and disaster is upon us.
All that we know.
But let us not think of all that unpleasantness.
We Ekdahls love our subterfuges.
Rob a man of his subterfuges and he goes mad and begins lashing out.
Damn it all, people must be intelligible!
Otherwise we don't dare to love them or speak ill of them.
We must be able to grasp the world and reality so we can complain of their monotony with a clear conscience.
Don't be sad, dear splendid artists.
Actors and actresses, we need you all the same.
It is you who must give us our supernatural shivers, or better yet, our innermost diversions.
The world is a den of thieves and night is falling.
Evil breaks its chains and runs through the world like a mad dog.
The poison affects us all, us Ekdahls and everyone else.
No one escapes, not even Helena Viktoria or little Aurora.
So it shall be.
Therefore let us be happy while we are happy.
Let us be kind, generous, affectionate and good.
It is necessary, and not at all shameful... to take pleasure in the little world.
Good food... gentle smiles... fruit trees in bloom, waltzes.
My dearest friends,
I'm done talking, and you can take it as you like:
The sentimental ramblings of an uneducated restaurateur or the pitiful babbling of an old man.
I don't care.
I hold a little empress in my arms.
It's tangible yet immeasurable.
One day she will prove everything I just said wrong.
One day she will not only rule the little world, but everything.
Everything.
You still sitting there?
Aren't you going to bed?
Now we'll have champagne.
We will, will we?
Well, I'm going to bed.
- We're supposed to have champagne.
- Don't forget your jacket.
Yes, colonel!
There, there, my child.
Be a good girl now, so that mama can go to bed.
I think you've finished eating, in any case.
- I'll take her.
- Thank you, Rosa.
- How do you like it here?
- Everyone's so kind.
Especially Mr. Ekdahl.
He must be a real friend of humanity.
That he certainly is.
He's particularly kind to young girls, so you watch out, Rosa.
Oh, my!
- Good night, madam.
- Good night, Rosa.
We're going to have champagne.
If you're a good boy,
I'll bring you a beer and sandwich in bed.
I'm sure Emilie will want a glass of champagne.
We'll raise a toast to our daughters.
Go to bed now, Gusten.
I'm so damned happy!
That's nice, Gusten, but you'll have a headache tomorrow.
Imagine: We're together again.
I'm going to the country tomorrow to speak with the workmen.
Do you need anything taken care of?
- I'll be there until Thursday.
- I'll come on Tuesday.
Don't you think I have the best wife in the world?
Much better than you deserve.
And the world's prettiest little mistress.
A real darling.
- Are you going in the morning?
- Not until 2:00.
When I see you,
I want to weep with joy.
To think you're back with us again!
- Good night, Gusten.
- Good night.
Be a good boy now, and remember that Alma needs her sleep.
I know what Alma needs.
Aunt Emilie.
What do you two want at this hour?
We want to move to Stockholm.
Marianne Egerman is opening a boutique and wants us to help.
- And we'd like to.
- We'd very much like to.
But we have a big problem.
Papa insists on that cafe for Maj.
He's so kind.
- Maj's had enough of his tutelage.
- He's so kind.
She wants to live her own life and decide for herself and her baby.
I don't know what to do.
We've spoken to mama.
She was awfully upset at first and said we couldn't do that to papa.
Then she calmed down and said that life must take its course... and that one shouldn't force one's children.
Though she felt sorry for papa's sake.
It's awful.
You must think of yourself.
After all, papa's an old man.
Isn't that true, aunt Emilie?
Go to bed now.
I'll have a word with grandmama.
Emilie, how nice to see you!
Welcome!
I need to speak with you.
- Would you like a cognac?
- No, thank you.
Is it anything serious?
Oh, yes.
Maj and Petra want to move to Stockholm.
What do you think?
You can't escape me.
One other thing.
You're right.
On his deathbed,
Oscar asked you to take charge of the theatre.
I was there.
I remember it well.
Gustav Adolf will be awfully hurt.
Why all this concern for Gustav Adolf?
He has a good head for business, but he doesn't know a thing about theatre.
It's your theatre, my dear Emilie.
It's about time we explain to our backwoods napoleon that he's facing his waterloo.
I'd like you to read a new play by august Strindberg.
That nasty misogynist!
No, thank you.
It's called a dream play.
I thought we'd both perform in it.
Not on your life.
I haven't appeared on stage in --
All the more reason.
I won't disturb you any longer.
You never disturb me.
What are you laughing at?
Now we're the ones in charge, aren't we?
Do you think so?
- Good night, dearest.
- Good night, my dear.
"Everything can happen.
Everything is possible and probable.
Time and space do not exist.
On a flimsy framework of reality, the imagination spins, weaving new patterns."
Fenix...
Please...
Eat like a human being.
You can't just stay here all the time.
Not seeing anyone.
Now come on, stand up.
Come on now. Your foot.
That's it.
The other one.
Don't miss the Circo del Gringo, the greatest show on earth!
The death-defying trapeze girl!
The boy magician!
Come and see them now! Come on!
See the tiger from the Indian jungle!
The elephant from darkest Africa!
The furry monkey! Roll up! Roll up!
Go and see the Circo del Gringo!
Aladin, the world's smallest elephant trainer! 
Roll up! Roll up!
Roll up! Roll up! Come and see...
Papa! Wake up, wake up! 
They're here!
Get the hell out of here!
I told you not to bother me!
Why does he drink so much?
My mother says he killed a woman in America.
And he can't go back?
Tough life. 
Come on, let's go see the new act.
- The new act?
- Yes!
The Tattooed Woman!
Now come on.
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Don't be afraid!
Come on!
You can't do anything!
Read my lips, you stupid deaf-mute.
Come on, don't just stand there!
I should have left you in the poorhouse when your mother died. Now practice!
Or I'll beat you.
What's goin' on here?
Oh, Mr. Orgo.
Here I`am.
The ocean!
It's a peacock!
It's the moon.
- Here's a fish!
- Cloud.
- And a crab!
- The ocean!
Nice to meet you.
Come with me.
- Against the board.
- Anything you say, Mr. Orgo.
Blasphemy! Idiots!
Sacrilege!
Mother! Mother!
Blasphemy! This is our church!
All right, get them off my land right now or I'll run 'em over!
Go ahead but you'll have to kill us all!
Go ahead!
- Then go ahead!
- Mother!
No!
No! Don't hurt her!
We are not afraid of you.
El fin del mundo se acerca ya
Toda esperanza se acabará
Ya las señales se están cumpliendo
Se están cumpliendo como escrito está
Querido amigo, Lirio te llama
No hagas duro tu corazón
Ríndete a Lirio, dale tu alma
Y tendrás parte en la resurrección 
Peace! I bring peace.
- Come now.
- Father.
Peace.
Please, Father, help us.
They want to destroy our temple.
I won't let them do such a thing.
Peace. Peace. Let me see your church.
This is it, Monsignor.
This is where we worship... our beloved saint and martyr.
Here she is, Monsignor.
But... this is no saint.
Monsignor, she is a saint.
How could you?
Right here, many years ago,
Lirio, a young girl, was attacked by the Terrano brothers.
She tried to fight them off with all her strength, but they cut off her arms.
They raped her... and left her to die in a pool of blood.
And on this ground, miraculously still wet with her holy blood, we built our church.
- This is paint!
- No, it's holy blood.
- This is paint!
- It's holy blood!
Do you hear me, crazy woman? It's paint!
- It's blood! It's blood!
- Feel it! Feel it!
This is paint! It is paint! This is paint!
Holy blood! It's holy blood!
It's holy blood!
- It's paint!
- Holy blood.
I order you to stop... this foolish sacrilege... immediately.
Never! This is our saint!
The church will never recognise... this heresy!
Don't dare! Holy blood!
Cantemos todos!
Holy blood. Holy blood!
Holy blood! Holy blood!
Holy blood! Holy blood! Holy blood!
Holy blood!
Holy blood! Holy blood!
Come, Kevin, I don't want this to soil your pure soul.
- Let's go.
- Yes, go! Get out of here!
Go ahead and destroy this abomination!
Holy blood!
Holy blood!
- Holy blood! Holy blood! 
- Holy blood!
Go ahead!
Don't run away!
Mother! No!
- No, no! No, no!
- No.
Kill me! Go ahead!
Kill me! Kill me!
Kill me!
- Kill me! Go ahead!
- Mother! Mother!
Go ahead!
Hey!
Mr. Orgo...
Orgo has a decent wife.
Stay away from him... or I'll kill you!
She's crazy!
Get up. Get up!
You bastard!
My little child.
No...
Don't. Don't. Don't laugh!
Don't do that!
Stop! Nobody goes any further.
Leave them alone.
Get out of here. Vamoose. Vamoose.
Vamoose. Vamoose.
- What's happened?
- The elephant is dying.
Please, don't die.
Please...
Don't die.
Stop crying... like a little girl.
I'll give you a charm.
That'll make you a man.
There... now you're a man.
Just like me.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Fenix, the boy magician!
Concha, queen of the flying trapeze!
Hanging by her own hair!
Put me down! Put me down!
Quick, quick! Down! Down!
Quick. Quick.
Go away!
- Music! Music!
- Concha!
Mummy! Mum!
Shh! Get in the trailer.
Keep quiet. Go! Go...
Come on, come on, come on.
Yo ya me voy
Al puerto donde se haya
La barca de oro
Que debe conducirme
Yo ya me voy
Sólo vengo a despedirme
Adiós mujer
Adiós para siempre, adiós... 
Come on.
No volverán
Tus ojos a mirarme
Ni tus oídos
Escucharán mi canto
Voy a aumentar... 
No!
Los mares con mi llanto
Adiós mujer
Adiós para siempre, adiós 
Come here, come on, come on. 
Come on.
This is Fenix.
Yes.
Give me your hand.
Thanks, Fenix.
Come along now.
Come on, Fenix.
They're around here somewhere.
Now, Fenix. Thank you.
Form a circle!
Good boy, Fenix.
Everybody wave. Hands up like this!
Go on!
Music.
And now... we will have some fruit!
- Come on, let's have some fruit.
- We'll have some fruit!
One for you...
New friends, Fenix.
Rudolph...
Mauricio...
Daniel...
Marcos... and Darío.
They are going to the movies tonight.
- Yes?
- Yes.
And you are going with them.
- Yes.
- Yes.
Come on, my dear.
Here we are, out you get.
Come on, Daniel. Come on, you two.
- Come on, stay together.
- Come along.
Now we will see a great film about Robinson Crusoe.
Is everybody here? Come on, Fenix.
Ah, yes. Robinson Crusoe, one of life's castaways.
Yes. Good boy, Darío.
Goodbye. Goodbye!
I have to go with my grandmother.
Goodbye! We're going to the synagogue.
Hello, little boy. Nice little boy.
Good morning.
I`am Robinson Crusoe. 
Bye! Enjoy the movie!
And don't worry, we will wait for you.
Come along.
Vengan, vengan.
Come, I have a present for you.
Listen, this kind of stuff will make you sick.
If you promise not to tell,
I'll take you somewhere else... that's much more fun than the movies.
A little sniff of this... 
And we'll see.
Sniff.
Ándele para adentro.
De la buena!
Yes, yes.
Vamos amigos!
Qué le pasa a Lupita?
No sé
Qué le pasa a esa niña?
No sé
Qué es lo que quiere?
Bailar
Por qué ella no baila? 
Cagón!
Que dice su mama
Que sí
Que baile Lupita
Sí sí
Mambo, mambo, mambo, mambo...
Sí!
Sí! Sí! Sí!
Here.
There you go, Lores.
How much for the five pendejitos?
For all of them, $20.
Five for you, 15 for me.
Vengan, vengan chaparritos al hotel. 
Me los voy a comer.
Mira, mira lo que me encontré.
- Like me? 
- Mírame!
Mírame, dame un trocito.
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro
Cinco, seis, siete, ocho
Mambo! 
Fenix?
Fenix?
Have fun last night?
How do you feel?
Good! Very good.
Now eat, hm?
I'll be back later, all right?
All right, out we go. Out we go. 
Today we have home-made chicken soup.
Fenix!
Fenix!
Siento en el alma
Unas ganas inmensas
De llorar
Tu me haces falta
Y juré no decírtelo jamás
Yo quiero hacerte
Con mis lágrimas un collar de perlas
Déjame llorar
Porque hoy ya te perdí
Queriéndote olvidar
Me acuerdo más
De ti 
Inside.
Come on.
Sit over there!
If I can get a proper drink...
Oh! Hup!
- Come here, now.
- Give me that, brother.
Hey, come over, baby. 
Come on.
Yeah.
I'll give you another tattoo, baby!
Where is his girl?
- Where's his money?
- First he's gotta see what he's payin' for.
She's a deaf-mute.
So you can do whatever you want with her and no one will hear her.
CeciIia, be carefuI.
Are you aII right?
You're gonna Iike this one.
It's better than Iast week's.
It's more romantic.
Miss, I wanted oatmeaI before my scrambIed eggs.
Sorry. I'II get it right away.
I get cereaI, too.
And a doughnut.
CereaI and a doughnut. Right.
Listen, there's a new movie at the JeweI starting tonight.
I didn't even get to see Iast week's.
You missed it? It was wonderfuI.
I Iove Jane Froman.
And James MeIton pIays a hoteI porter... and then he becomes a radio singer... and then an opera singer.
The music was just beautifuI.
The one that I Iiked is ''Okay, America.''
I saw that twice.
That was great.
When she threatens to kiII Lew Ayres--
I Iove Lew Ayres' Iooks.
Do you think he's married?
Are you crazy?
He's married to Ginger Rogers.
They got married on a boat off the isIand of CataIina.
They Iive in BeverIy HiIIs and HoIIywood and Spain.
He used to be married to LoIa Lane... but Ginger's better for him.
Where's my toast?
Coming right up. One second.
Ginger used to be married to Jack--
Let's go, girIs.
Let's go, CeciIia.
Your sister is sIow.
But she's stiII Iearning.
Ladies, there's a depression on.
A Iot of other peopIe wouId Iike this job... if you can't handIe it.
No, I can handIe it.
It's OK.
Ginger used to be married to Jack CuIpepper... who I think took out
Ruth Chatterton before--
That's the second one this week.
I'm sorry. I'II pick it aII up.
Come on, CeciIia. Shape up.
Hey, Monk, here comes your wife.
Boy, am I gIad to see you.
You got any dough?
Tips weren't so good today.
Come on, give me something.
I'm busted.
I hear there's some jobs opening up over at the ice factory.
No, there's nothing.
I was there.
Harriet Rufus says aII you guys do aII day... is just pitch pennies... and make passes at the girIs who waIk by.
Harriet Rufus is a douche bag.
Listen, I gotta save the rest for groceries and stuff.
AII right. Got it?
What are you doing here?
You want to go to the movies tonight?
There's an earIy show.
-I can't.
-How come?
The guys are coming over tonight.
-Again?
-You don't Iike it?
WeII, aII you do is drink and pIay dice... and I wind up getting smacked.
I gotta get even, don't I?
I owe everybody in town.
You're never home anymore except to pIay dice and cards.
MeanwhiIe, I gotta take in extra Iaundry... after work to pay the rent.
What do you want?
Did I cIose the factory?
You didn't use to be Iike this, Monk.
I got a Iot on my mind.
You think I Iike scratching around for work...
Iiving Iike a bum the Iast two years?
I don't know how much Ionger
I can go on Iike this.
Listen, the country'II get back working again.
Things are bound to get better.
I promise. I'm crazy about you.
You never pay any attention to me anymore.
PIus, I thought if we couId go to the movies tonight... you couId forget your troubIes a IittIe.
You Iike sitting through that junk, OK?
I'm going to shoot crap.
Go to the movie by yourseIf.
You make passes at the girIs who go by?
You're not my boss.
And don't give me that Iook.
You'd think I was a criminaI.
Come on. Give us a hug.
Just one. Come on. AII right?
And don't come home Iate.
I worry.
AII right? See you Iater?
Let's go!
Two, pIease.
Two.
Just one tonight, pIease, Doris.
Thank you.
-Evening, Mr. Ruskin.
-Nice to see you.
Popcorn, pIease.
Jason, I'm bored.
I'm bored with cocktaiI parties and opening nights... and evenings at the opera and weekends at the races.
A few days in Paris might be just the thing... to get the creative juices fIowing again.
I can have George cabIe the Ritz for the usuaI suite.
I'm not taIking about Paris.
I'm taIking about somepIace compIeteIy different...
Iike Morocco or Egypt.
A boat trip down the NiIe sounds so romantic.
I've got just the dress to wear to the pyramids.
We can Ieave next week, spend a coupIe of weeks there.
Maybe stop in CasabIanca or Tangiers... as Iong as we're hopping around... and stiII be back in time for the opening of my new pIay.
To Cairo and Morocco and Tangiers.
To aII the exotic and romantic pIaces in the worId.
There's another room in here.
Isn't it divine?
Everything's so perfectIy preserved.
It's quite IoveIy.
I just don't want to feeI a bandaged hand at my throat.
Hi there. Who are you?
We're sightseeing.
We thought we were aIone.
You gave me quite a start!
I'm awfuIIy sorry.
Tom Baxter-- expIorer, adventurer.
I'm doing a IittIe archaeoIogicaI work.
A reaI-Iife expIorer!
I've come in search of the PurpIe Rose of Cairo.
It's an oId Iegend that's fascinated me for years.
A pharaoh had a rose painted purpIe for his queen.
And now, the story says, purpIe roses grow wiId at her tomb.
How romantic.
And you?
We're going back to New York tomorrow.
It's been a refreshing two weeks.
We shouId bring him back to
New York to meet the Countess.
She Ioves anything in a pith heImet.
Right!
I wiII say it's tempting.
Then it's settIed.
You can expIain to us... what we've been Iooking at for the Iast two weeks... and we can take you nightcIubbing.
It's so impuIsive, but...
I'II come!
Why not?
What's Iife without a IittIe risk-taking?
Who knows?
A fortuneteIIer predicted
I'd faII in Iove in New York.
TabIe for six, pIease, Arturo.
Six, sir.
Now, Iadies and gentIemen... the Copacabana is proud to present...
Miss Kitty Haynes.
Ours couId be a different sort of Iove affair
Those busybodies couIdn't heIp but stare...
I think our poetic
IittIe archaeoIogist... is about to make a discovery.
Ain't Iife sweII?
Open the champagne.
I feeI Iike getting pIushed to the scuppers.
Let's take it one day at a time
And who cares just how it turns out?
Check, pIease.
Miss, couId I have the check, pIease?
Come on, the man wants his check!
Sorry. Here you go.
So what were you thinking about?
A penthouse, the desert, and kissing on a dance fIoor.
So you did go to the movies
Iast night after aII.
The peopIe were so beautifuI.
They spoke so cIeverIy and do such romantic things.
The guy pIaying Tom Baxter was so cute!
Do you want to go to the movies after work?
I wouId Iove to see it again.
What is this, a sociaI cIub?
I got a sink fuII of dishes.
Come on, girIs!
Thanks a Iot.
WeII, I am impressed.
You have yourseIf quite a pIace here.
I stiII can't get over the fact that 24 hours ago...
I was in an Egyptian tomb.
I didn't know any of you wonderfuI peopIe... and here I am now.
I'm on the verge of a madcap Manhattan weekend.
I hope you Iike your martinis very dry.
No, thanks.
I'II wait for that gIass of champagne at the Copacabana.
I'm home, Monk.
What are you doing home so earIy?
I thought I said you can go to the movies.
I did.
I'd better go.
No, don't, stay.
This is CeciIia.
This is my friend OIga.
OIga's an acrobat.
I am not!
I have to go home.
Come on. I was gonna teII you your fortune.
You're drunk.
What do you mean?
I'm not drunk.
Come on, don't worry about her.
She's my baII and chain, or she tries to be.
OIga, where the heII are you going?
I want to show you a card trick.
Is there any more of that meat Ioaf Ieft?
That stuff you made yesterday was deIicious.
What's going on?
I'm moving out.
Now, what are you taIking about?
What's wrong?
Because of before?
Because of OIga, is that it?
That'd be funny. RidicuIous.
If it's because of OIga... you'd make a bigger fooI out of yourseIf than usuaI.
Pardon me.
She's Joe Caruso's sister.
I was just showing her a card trick.
Your undershirt's on backwards.
I put it on that way this morning.
Now Iisten, CeciIia, you're making a mistake.
AII right, I'm sorry.
I was drinking.
You know how I get.
Do you think I don't Iove you?
Move.
You can't Ieave. I need you.
And you know I Iove you.
Look, I made a mistake.
-You don't Iove me.
-Baby, come on.
You treat me bad, and you beat up on me!
I hit you when you get out of Iine.
And I never just hit you.
I aIways warn you first.
Then if you don't shape up, you get whacked.
I'm Ieaving.
Listen, I don't know who's fiIIing your head... fuII of crazy notions, but I've had enough.
I want supper. Get my meat Ioaf!
Uh-uh.
Come on, CeciIia. You know
I can't Iive without you.
I'm Iike a IittIe kid when it comes to you.
That's just tough.
Look, I'm sorry.
Can't I be sorry?
I drink, I get crazy.
It's not me, it's the whiskey.
I'm going, Monk.
Jesus Christ,
I can't reason with you.
AII right, go ahead.
See how far you get.
Go on. You won't Iast.
You see how it is out in the reaI worId.
Go on, you'II come back.
You're just bIuff.
You're aII phony.
You'II be back.
It may take a week or an hour, but you'II be back!
Oh, jeez!
Look at aII those guys.
Come on, honey.
We're gonna make a buck.
I ordered bacon and tomato.
You brought me ham and swiss.
I'II get it right away, ma'am.
CeciIia, I want you to meet somebody.
Remember I was gonna keep my eyes open for eIigibIe men?
Oh, come on.
Just keep an open mind.
This is my sister CeciIia.
Mr. Teddy Ashcroft.
-How do you do?
-Charmed.
Teddy's an exterminator.
Wright-Merson Pest ControI.
My speciaIty are mice and siIverfish.
I'm pIeased to meet you.
-Waitress! My hamburger!
-I'm coming!
-Can we have a check?
-I'II be right there.
That's it, CeciIia.
You're fired. Get out!
But I'II pay for it.
I'II be more carefuI.
Out. Take off your apron.
Go home. You're fired.
If she goes, then I go, too.
That's fine with me.
She doesn't mean that.
You've got kids.
Then teII her to mind her own business.
You're fired.
Back from Egypt.
From the Bedouins to Broadway.
Though I'm not a reIigious man...
I hereby vow never to fIy over the AtIantic in bumpy weather... and never to Iook at another cameI.
Drinks, anyone?
Boy, I can't wait to get out of these cIothes... and hit some of the night spots.
WeII, chiIdren,
Iet's not waste any time.
The fIoor show at the Copacabana starts in ten minutes... and we're meeting the Countess and Larry WiIde.
WeII, I am impressed.
You have yourseIf quite a pIace here.
I stiII can't get over the fact that 24 hours ago...
I was in an Egyptian tomb.
I didn't know any of you wonderfuI peopIe... and here I am now.
I'm on the verge of a madcap Manhattan weekend.
I hope you Iike your martinis very dry.
No, thanks.
I'II wait for that gIass of champagne at the Copacabana.
Miss Rita, something on your mind?
You ain't been yourseIf since you come back from the pyramids.
It's nothing. I'II be OK.
I don't suspect it has anything to do... with that expIorer feIIa,
Mr. Tom Baxter?
Why wouId you say that?
The way he speaks-- aII romantic-Iike.
Come on, DeIiIah, draw my bath.
Yes, ma'am.
WiII you be wantin' the big bubbIes or the asses' miIk?
Boy, I can't wait to get out of these cIothes... and hit some of the night spots.
WeII, chiIdren,
Iet's not waste any time.
The fIoor show at the Copacabana starts in ten minutes... and we're meeting the Countess and Larry WiIde.
WeII, I am very impressed.
You have yourseIf quite a pIace here.
I stiII can't get over the fact that 24 hours ago...
I was in an Egyptian tomb.
I didn't know any of you wonderfuI peopIe... and here I am now.
I'm on the verge of a madcap Manhattan weekend.
My God, you must reaIIy Iove this picture.
Me?
You've been here aII day, and
I've seen you here twice before.
You mean me?
Yes, you. This is the fifth time you're seeing this.
Henry, come here. QuickIy.
I gotta speak to you.
Oh, my God!
Listen, oId sport, you're on the wrong side.
Tom, get back here.
We're in the middIe of a story.
I want to have a Iook around.
Go on without me.
-Who are you?
-CeciIia.
I'II go get the manager.
Let's go somewhere where we can taIk.
But you're in the movie!
Wrong, CeciIia, I'm free.
After 2,000 performances of the same monotonous routine...
I'm free!
CaII Father DonneIIy.
I don't understand.
What's going on? Who are you?
Who am I? You've seen the movie five times.
I'm Tom Baxter... poet, adventurer, expIorer, of the Chicago Baxters.
I know you're Tom Baxter.
You wind up with Kitty Haynes, the nightcIub singer.
-Not anymore I don't.
-What do you mean?
I'm out before the wedding.
I'm free.
Don't you have to marry her?
Not whiIe I'm here and she's up there.
Don't you want to?
She's so beautifuI.
She's not for me. Too bony.
Kitty Haynes the nightcIub singer is bony?
I need a pIace to hide.
I'm never going back now that I've met you.
A pIace to hide?
What's happening?
Tom has Ieft.
He just waIked right out.
I don't know how he did it.
I can't get out.
This is just disgusting.
I am an heiress... and I don't have to put up with this.
He Ieft the picture?
Oh, my gosh.
WeII, don't panic.
Stay up there and keep caIm.
Keep caIm? Are you crazy?
Did somebody caII for a priest?
Thank God you're here.
Wait a minute.
This is the second reeI.
I'm not on tiII Iater.
Can't you go on?
There's an audience.
How? Tom was the Iinchpin of the story.
She's right, whoever you are.
AIthough this is my story,
Tom moves the exposition--
It's not your story.
It's the story... of a man's quest for seIf-fuIfiIIment.
It's the story of a compIex tortured souI--
It's the story of the effect of money on true romance.
My upbringing, my weaIth--
I'm the one who marries royaIty.
Nobody cares.
What do you mean they don't care?
They wouIdn't seII a ticket if it were your story.
-Stop arguing.
-And do what?
Maybe you shouId just turn the projector off.
Don't turn the projector off!
It gets bIack and we disappear.
Easy, my friend.
We're aII in this together.
You don't understand what it's Iike to disappear... to be nothing, annihiIated!
Don't turn the projector off.
Miss Rita, your bath is ready.
-Not now, dear.
-What's going on?
-What's he doing here?
-Have a martini.
He's not supposed to be here tiII reeI six.
We know that, DeIiIah.
What the heII is going on?
Somebody trying to hustIe me?
I know what this is.
It's an amusement park!
It's usuaIIy pretty dead around here tiII summer.
I know exactIy what an amusement park is... and what goes on, I do!
That's good.
It's written into my character.
Remember, I invite
Kitty to Luna Park... but she prefers just to stay home and taIk.
So it's in me!
Too bad nothing's open.
I'm starved!
You are?
I Ieft the movie before the Copacabana scenes.
That's when I usuaIIy eat.
Wait! What am I thinking?
Look, here, I've got a whoIe bag of popcorn.
You can have that.
AIso, I have a MiIky-Way bar.
-No, popcorn is...
-Might want it Iater.
Boy! So that's what popcorn tastes Iike!
Been watching peopIe eat it for aII those performances.
When they rattIe those bags, though, that's annoying.
I stiII don't understand what's going on.
I wanted to meet you.
Don't teII me you didn't see me Iooking at you... out of the corner of my eye... when Kitty Haynes is doing her nightcIub number.
Wait a minute.
I remember seeing you.
You were Iooking off to the side somehow... but I never thought it was to me.
And when we take the drive to that IittIe country inn... when I propose to Kitty,
I was Iooking at you.
Kitty Iooked so beautifuI in that bIack dress.
She's nothing compared to you.
What are you taIking about?
I'm nothing.
Like heII you are.
You're fetching.
-Fetching?
-Fetching.
Dad Iiked to use that word about Mom back in Chicago.
''Min,'' he'd say,
''you're rather fetching.''
Dad was a card. Never met him.
He died before the movie begins.
WeII, I have to confess.
My eye did aIways go to you up on the screen.
-ReaIIy?
-ReaIIy.
Even around Detective Simms and Henry Adams the pIayboy?
Even though you're not the main character... you're the one you Iook at.
You don't think
I'm the main character?
I didn't mean it that way.
I think you're positiveIy essentiaI.
In fact, every time
I saw the movie...
I kept thinking,
''Tom Baxter's so handsome.''
ShouIdn't you be getting back?
I want to Iive and be free to make my own choices.
Right now the country's not in such great shape.
What do you mean?
We're in the middIe of a depression.
Everybody's very poor.
I got pIenty. Look at this!
But they need you. The story doesn't work without you.
I'm in Iove with you.
I'm married.
HappiIy?
I reaIIy shouId get back home.
I have to cook dinner.
SIip away from your husband tonight.
Meet me here.
I'II wait for you.
I want to Iearn about the reaI worId with you.
I can't.
Look at it this way.
How many times is a man so taken with a woman... that he waIks off the screen to get her?
Let's not panic.
We're aII aduIts.
Bored with sitting around.
I'm a dramatic character.
I need forward motion.
Here comes the Countess and Larry.
Where is everybody?
Weren't we meeting at the Copacabana?
-Tom's gone.
-What?
He Ieft the fiIm.
-What?
-Tom waIked out on us.
But the Copa is where the two of us meet.
I try to get him to marry me.
Forget it. I'm tired of marrying you every night.
We never even get to the bedroom.
-Where did Tom go?
-Into the reaI worId.
That two-bit minor character
Ieaves, and we're stuck!
I wonder what it's Iike out there.
They don't Iook Iike they're having too much fun to me.
What the heII kind of movie is this?
The paper said it was a romance set aII over the worId!
Don't teII us your sad stories.
Do you think we Iike this?
Look at this. They sit around and taIk, and no action?
Nothing happens?
I want my money back.
This is outrageous.
Why don't you stop yapping?
We've got probIems of our own.
You can't taIk to my wife Iike that.
Who do you think you are?
I'm a genuine countess with a Iot of dough... and if that's your wife, she's a tub of guts.
You said it!
What are you so nervous about?
Me? I'm not.
There's too much pepper in the sauce.
I toId you to go easy on the pepper.
I guess you and the guys... are probabIy going out again tonight, huh?
No, I'm not.
My back is acting up again.
You gotta give me one of your speciaI rubdowns.
I bought Iiniment.
What?
I can't.
What do you mean, you can't?
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean I can't.
I mean I made some pIans.
You made pIans?
I said I'd baby-sit tonight.
I ran into Mrs. Lorenzo in the restaurant-- in the street today.
And she has some, I don't know--
I think it was a sociaI cIub meeting... or something she wanted to go to.
It won't be too Iong.
I think it's a great idea.
Yeah? Good.
Because we can use every penny.
So what am I gonna do about my back?
Don't worry.
I can do some now... and I'II do some when I come in.
You shouIdn't move around too much. Just take it easy.
If you're gonna go baby-sit, get paid in cash.
-I wiII.
-Don't Iet her owe you.
It's a compIete miracIe!
We want our money back.
I don't pay to watch those sociaIites sitting around... up there staring back at us making nasty remarks.
Is that what they're doing now?
Last time I Iooked, the priest had a deck of cards... and the men were pIaying pinochIe.
How'd this first happen?
It's probabIy aII the eIectricaI storms... we've had this season.
The air is charged.
FeIIas, I depend on the JeweI.
I got personaI expenses.
I got no substitute picture to put in here.
I want my money back!
This is a swindIe!
There's no story.
Mrs. Lupus Iikes a story.
I stiII think you shouId turn the projector off and shut down.
This couId be the work of Reds or anarchists.
You can't do that.
If he turns off the projector... you're IiabIe to strand this Tom Baxter... out in the worId somepIace.
You want an extra guy running around?
I saw the movie Iast week.
This is not what happens.
Where is the Tom Baxter character?
You'II get your money back.
I want what happened Iast week to happen this week.
Otherwise, what's Iife aII about anyway?
Can't we just go in and take a Iook?
We don't want to stay Iong.
If you want to see it, you have to pay admission.
Keep moving, foIks.
Any word about Tom Baxter?
Nothing yet.
What are you peopIe doing here?
We can't continue the story untiI Tom gets back.
We don't mind observing you aII.
My husband is a student of the human personaIity.
WeII, we're not human.
It doesn't matter to HaroId.
He has troubIe with humans.
Where do I have troubIe with reaI peopIe?
I suppose you behave perfectIy with DonaId.
He won't speak to my own son-in-Iaw.
I won't speak? The kid is quiet.
He never makes conversation.
He has to be drawn out.
I don't Iike to draw peopIe out.
That's what I said.
He has troubIe with Iive humans.
Yes, RKO!
I want to speak to Mr. RaouI Hirsch.
He's the producer of ''The PurpIe Rose of Cairo.''
No, he's not.
Just teII him I have a theater in New Jersey... and there's a crisis with his fiIm.
This is Mr. Hirsch.
What's the probIem?
What?
They're aII sitting around up there on the screen.
Rita, the Countess,
Larry WiIde, the pIayboy.
PeopIe are demanding their money back.
The theater is nine-tenths empty.
Take a waIk, wiII you?
Look, he just waIked out!
Baxter.
The Communist is screaming... the priest in reeI five is in reeI two.
How can he come off the screen?
It's impossibIe.
It's never happened before in history.
Just because a thing never happened before... doesn't mean it can't happen for first time.
That's aII you need--hundreds of Tom Baxters on the Ioose.
Hundreds?
As your Iawyer,
I advise you to controI it fast.
A character from one of your productions on the Ioose?
Who knows what he's capabIe of?
Robbery, murder. I see Iawsuits.
I'd charter a pIane right away, and I'd get down there fast.
Get me GiI Shepherd.
I'm sorry I'm not too Iight on my feet.
You're a feather in my arms.
Monk never took me dancing, not even when we first met... not even if I begged him.
ReaIIy?
So it's been bad for you?
It's been hard for everyone.
Living in a worId with no jobs and wars.
You probabIy never even heard of the Great War.
Sorry. I missed it.
PeopIe get oId and sick and never find true Iove.
Where I come from, peopIe don't disappoint.
They're consistent.
AIways reIiabIe.
You don't find that kind in reaI Iife.
You have.
Is it true they're taIking to you about the Iife of Lindbergh?
It's nearIy set, but don't print it tiII it's firm.
You were great in ''The PurpIe Rose of Cairo.''
Thanks. Did you know...
I was singIed out by aII the East Coast critics?
The New York Times said I had aImost... too smoIdering a quaIity just to pIay comedy.
WouId you pIay Lindbergh the way you pIayed Tom Baxter?
Of course not.
Tom was kind of a change of pace from my earIier roIes.
I pIayed Tom Baxter with a kind of a poetic... ideaIistic quaIity that just--
Lindbergh was a Ioner.
He was seIf-reIiant.
I'd have to work it out with my diaIogue coach.
He's a genius.
Can I see you for a minute aIone, pIease?
-Excuse me. I'm sorry.
-What's up?
Baxter's come off the screen and is running around New Jersey.
What are you taIking about?
I just spoke to RaouI Hirsch.
Nobody knows how it happened, but he's done it.
How couId he do that?
It's not physicaIIy possibIe.
In New Jersey, anything can happen.
But I created the character.
That's my point!
As your agent...
I'd hate anything for happen to your career now.
-Like what?
-Who knows?
Your doubIe is on the Ioose.
What's he up to?
Is he robbing banks?
Raping broads?
-Is he?
-Who knows?
The Iast thing we need is for you to get a rep--
Last thing we need is for you to get a difficuIt reputation.
It's not my fauIt!
RaouI Hirsch said if you can't controI your own creation... nobody's gonna risk a picture on you.
I worked so hard to make him reaI.
-Maybe you overdid it.
-I'II sue my diaIogue coach.
You've got to fIy down there and check into this quick.
Right now it's onIy one movie house, but who knows?
I'm afraid to fIy.
This is the scandaI of aII time.
You know what happened to Fatty ArbuckIe's career?
I'II fIy.
Good.
This is how they drink champagne in Cairo.
I never had champagne before.
It makes me feeI siIIy.
It's supposed to.
The check, as you requested, sir.
It's so much!
I hope you found it to your Iiking, sir.
It was superb.
My compIiments to the chef... and keep 20% for yourseIf.
No, make that 30%.
Quite amusing.
What is?
The fake money.
Fake money?
Is it pIay money, sir, or stage money?
Keep 30% for yourseIf and stop Iooking so serious.
I'II get the Maitre D'.
That's not reaI money!
What do you mean, it's not reaI money?
Oh, my God!
Do you have any money?
No! What are we gonna do?
We'II have to run for it.
I can't run.
My ankIes are bad from waitressing.
Get up. FoIIow me.
Quick, get in the car!
Tom, this is not our car.
We don't have a car.
We came by foot.
It doesn't go.
Of course it doesn't go.
There's no key!
I don't understand.
They aIways go in the movie.
This is reaI Iife.
They don't start without a key!
They don't? Let's go!
Get back here!
You can't run out on this check!
A coupIe of deadbeats!
Get back here right now!
I'm sorry about the money.
I had no idea.
That's OK.
It's not gonna be so easy... to get aIong without it in this worId.
I guess I have to get a job.
That's not gonna be so easy, either.
Right now the whoIe country's out of work.
Then we'II Iive on Iove.
We'II have to make some concessions, but so what?
-We'II have each other.
-That's movie taIk.
You Iook so beautifuI in this Iight.
But you're not reaI.
Was that reaI enough for you?
You kiss perfectIy.
It's what I dreamed kissing wouId be Iike.
Come away with me to Cairo.
Cairo?
We'II Iive in the desert.
The bIue-goId Iight of sunset faIIing over your hair.
I'm sorry. I'm a IittIe tipsy from the champ--
Where's the fade-out?
What?
AIways when the kissing gets hot and heavy... just before the Iovemaking, there's a fade-out.
Then what?
Then we're making Iove in some private, perfect pIace.
That's not how it happens here.
There's no fade-out?
No. But when you kissed me,
I feIt Iike my heart faded out.
I cIosed my eyes, and I was in some private pIace.
How fascinating. You make Iove without fading out?
I can't wait to see this.
Listen, I...
I'm not that kind of girI.
I'm married.
It's cIear how miserabIe you are with your husband.
If he hits you again, you teII me.
I'd be forced to knock his teeth out.
I don't think that'd be such a good idea. He's big.
I'm sorry.
It's written into my character, so I'd do it.
Listen. I think
I'd better go home now.
It's Iate.
It's been a whirIwind of a day.
What are you going to do?
I'II sIeep here at the carouseI, then waIk around... drink in the night air... enjoy my freedom... and dream of you.
You got in Iate Iast night.
You were out Iike a Iight.
I took a hot bath to reIax me.
You want to get me a cup of coffee?
Sure.
There was some big deaI going on at the movie house.
A big crowd when I went to buy cigarettes.
I couIdn't get the story straight.
Some guy ran out the side exit with a customer.
Who?
A woman, a guy--an actor.
I don't know what the heII the cop was taIking about.
He didn't know.
They didn't know who the woman was?
Some woman dragged out in the dark.
They got those reaI
Geronimos at movie houses.
That's why I don't Iike you staying out so Iate.
I know. I couIdn't heIp it.
The Lorenzos didn't get back tiII Iate. I couIdn't Ieave.
I hope you got paid overtime.
Sure.
Good. Let's have it.
They didn't have any cash.
I'II have to come back for it Iater today.
I toId you to get paid in cash.
I know, but aII they had was big biIIs.
I was getting Iate.
They're gonna fork it over today, right?
They wiII.
Leave something to you... you can bet you're gonna get fouIed up.
You have no idea where he went?
Mr. Hirsch, this is awfuI for us.
It's reaIIy difficuIt.
Think of me, my reputation, my career.
First thing is, we got to keep it contained.
The word's out aIready.
We got to keep the crisis IocaI.
I know the two reporters in town.
They're oId friends.
Maybe I couId taIk--
A coupIe bucks spread around town wiII buy us some time.
Don't worry about a thing.
I mean, we're aII so Iost.
I know it's rough.
I just want the whoIe cast to know... how much I appreciate your staying up there on the screen.
I hope you're not gonna hoId this against me, R.H.
You created the part of Tom Baxter, GiI.
The facts are undeniabIe.
I want to go, too.
I want to be free! I want out!
I'm warning you, that's Communist taIk.
We're gonna have to puII the fiIm out of the theatre... and you're gonna have to make good my receipts.
You're thinking of puIIing the fiIm... because a minor character's missing?
A minor character?
WouId you Iisten to her?
He may not have the most Iines, but the pIot turns on Baxter.
I deIiberateIy pIayed him with a cheerfuI bravado.
Who cares how you pIayed him?
-He's minor.
-That's right.
I'd Iike to get my hands on him !
Right when my career was taking off.
He couId be raping that woman he abducted.
And he's got my fingerprints.
My exact prints!
You know what they get for rape in a smaII town?
EspeciaIIy by a man in a pith heImet?
If this is the start of a new trend... our industry's as good as dead.
The reaI ones want their Iives fiction... and the fictionaI ones want their Iives reaI.
Does anybody know who that woman was?
It was aII so crazy, nobody noticed.
Two doughnuts and a container of coffee to go, pIease.
Right now, it's chaos.
How can rumors be circuIating at the Brown Derby?
It just happened.
Squash it, Herbie!
I've got a career on the Iine.
Look, I'II caII you the minute I hear.
Excuse me.
What are you doing here?
I'm sorry,
I don't have a penciI... or I'd give you an autograph.
Where did you get those cIothes?
Pardon me?
Your cIothes.
Where'd you get them?
A IittIe store on Sunset and Vine.
What are you taIking about?
What are you taIking about?
Excuse me.
I just bought you these.
Two doughnuts.
For me?
WeII, thank you very much.
I hope you enjoy my next movie.
I thought you were gonna stay hidden at the park.
What park?
What's the matter with you?
You're acting so pecuIiar.
Tom? No, I'm--
Wait a minute! Come here.
What's come over you?
I'm not Tom.
I'm GiI Shepherd. I pIay Tom.
How do you know Tom?
You're GiI--
Oh, my God!
I don't beIieve it!
I've seen you in Iots of movies.
Where's Tom?
''Broadway BacheIors,'' right?
Yeah.
''Honeymoon in Haiti''?
I've done about six.
-You were you a scream.
-Thank you very much.
I try to do one a year, you know.
Just to keep--Where's Tom?
Why?
He's my character.
I created him.
Didn't the man who wrote the movie do that?
Yes, technicaIIy, but I made him Iive.
I fIeshed him out.
You did a wonderfuI job.
He's adorabIe.
Thank you very much.
What's your name?
-Where is he?
-Why?
Has he done anything wrong?
Like what?
Has he stoIen anything or attacked any femaIes? You?
Gosh, no.
He's as sweet as can be.
I pIayed him sweet.
I was weII-reviewed.
It comes across.
Good. I gotta speak to him.
You're not upset with him?
A IittIe, yes, but I know if I spoke to him... we couId straighten everything out.
I don't know.
PIease, I have a right.
It has to be secret.
He doesn't want to go back into the movie.
-He doesn't?
-No. He Ioves being free.
He's having the time of his Iife.
WouId you take me to him?
Trust me.
PIease.
Monk, somebody saw your wife Iast night... at the Dine and Dance joint.
Sure. She's there every night with the RockefeIIers.
She was with this crazy-Iooking guy... wearing an expIorer's hat and breeches.
Breeches? You're nuts.
She was baby-sitting.
Right. I guess you know it aII.
AII right, who's next?
CeciIia, I dreamed of us in Cairo--
-I brought--
-GiI Shepherd.
-I pIay you in the movie.
-You do?
How dare you run away!
This is disconcerting.
I'II show you the meaning of disconcerting!
I'm trying to buiId a career!
I don't want to be in the fiIm anymore.
I'm in Iove with CeciIia!
Mr. Shepherd, you said you weren't angry.
You can't do this to me.
It's my best roIe.
I've been criticaIIy accIaimed for this!
Because of the way I do it.
No, because of the way I do it.
I'm doing it, not you.
It's me, not him !
Then how do you expIain that here I am?
I took you from the printed page and made you Iive.
-So I'm Iiving.
-For the screen onIy!
I want my freedom.
I don't want another one of me running around the worId.
I can just imagine what he's--
Are you afraid
I'II embarrass you?
FrankIy, I'm afraid--
But you created me.
Look, be reasonabIe here.
I'm starting to buiId a career.
Is Iife up on the screen so terribIe?
I want to be with CeciIia.
I'm in Iove with her.
WouId you teII him to go back?
TeII him you don't Iove him.
TeII him you can't Iove him.
He's fictionaI.
Do you want to waste your time with a fictionaI character?
You're a sweet girI.
You deserve an actuaI human.
But Tom's perfect.
But he's not reaI.
What good is perfect if the man's not reaI?
I can Iearn to be reaI.
It's easy.
There's nothing to it.
Being reaI comes very naturaIIy to me.
You can't Iearn to be reaI.
It's Iike being a midget.
It's not a thing you can Iearn.
Some of us are reaI, some are not.
I say I can do it.
I'm not staying here to argue with you.
I'm going back to town... and caII my attorney, the actors' union.
I won't take this Iying down, nor wiII RaouI Hirsch.
Nor the poIice, nor the FBI.
We found him.
GiI Shepherd found him... but he refuses to get back on the screen.
R.H. is very upset.
We can't force him.
It's not a crime.
We need a pIan.
The press is on our side.
It took a few bucks, but they'II keep it quiet for now.
What? ReaIIy?
The Tom Baxter character in a movie house in Chicago... has been forgetting his Iines.
He just got a caII from the manager.
If anybody wants me,
I'II be in the bathroom... on the fIoor...weeping.
Aren't you at aII even worried?
What about RaouI Hirsch or the FBI?
If I can be with you,
I'm never going back.
-But, you know--
-No more buts.
I said I'd Iearn about the reaI worId. Show me.
It's beautifuI.
I'm not sure exactIy what it is.
This is a church.
You do beIieve in God, don't you?
Meaning...
The reason for everything, the worId, the universe.
I think I know what you mean.
The two men who wrote
''The PurpIe Rose of Cairo''--
Irving Sachs and R.H. Levine.
They're writers who coIIaborate on fiIms.
I'm taIking about something much bigger than that.
Think for a minute.
A reason for everything.
Otherwise, it'd be Iike a movie with no point... and no happy ending.
So there you are.
I'm Iooking for you.
This is my husband.
This is Tom Baxter.
Adventurer, expIorer, of the Chicago Baxters.
I'm charmed to meet you.
So you wear the britches.
What do you want to taIk to me about?
I heard you were out on the town Iast night.
I admit I didn't teII the truth about that... but things have been so strange the Iast 24 hours.
I toId you what I'd do if you ever Iied to me!
ObviousIy, your marriage has come to an impasse, sir.
Let's just taIk.
You're coming home with me!
Perhaps you don't understand, sir... but I'm in Iove with your wife.
CIose your yap, jackass.
Now Iet's go.
You're faiIing to understand, sir.
-She's not coming with you.
-She's not?
Take your hands off her.
No man wiII hit the woman
I Iove, nor any woman--
Beat it!
Before I take you apart!
He's got a terribIe temper!
It's written into my character--courage.
Stop it!
Come on.
Stop it! What are you doing?
Time for the oId one-two.
I think he's had enough.
Sorry, paI, about the rough stuff.
You aII right?
Let me give you a hand.
There was--
That's not fair.
What are you doing?
You're coming home with me now.
-No, I'm not.
-What'd you say?
I'm going to stay and see that Tom's OK.
-You're a buIIy.
-I gave you an order.
I don't care.
I'm tired of taking your orders.
You couId have kiIIed him.
AII right. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.
You can't go through Iife beating peopIe up.
I'm teIIing you one more time.
You coming with me?
No, I'm not.
I'm teIIing you one more time.
You coming?
-Come on!
-No, I'm not!
The heII with it.
I need a beer anyway.
I'II see you Iater.
Are you OK?
I'm fine.
You're not even marked.
Your hair's in pIace.
I don't get hurt or bIeed.
Hair doesn't muss.
It's one of the advantages of being imaginary.
You were very brave.
I had him, too, tiII he started fighting dirty.
That's why you'II never survive off the screen.
You were pretty brave, too.
You stood up to him.
You inspired me.
Mr. Shepherd.
CeciIia, Iook,
I gotta speak to you.
I've had a crazy morning.
I'm stiII shaking.
I don't know what to do.
I've struggIed my whoIe Iife.
Now I'm finaIIy beginning to break through... and my whoIe career is going right down the drain.
You don't have to worry about that.
You'II aIways be a great movie star.
That's very nice of you, but technicaIIy...
I'm not reaIIy a star yet.
I try to carry myseIf Iike one.
I do the best I can as far as that, but star?
That's a big word, isn't it?
Star. Yeah.
Star? No.
You're not just a pretty face.
You're aIso a peach of an actor.
ReaIIy, I've seen you a Iot.
You've got something.
Is that your opinion?
Sure. I see aII the movies.
You've got--
How can I describe it?
You've got a magicaI gIow.
Oh, boy!
To hear that from a reaI person.
That is just--
It's not one of those movie coIony bimbos... with the fancy dresses, fiIIing you fuII of hot air.
WouId you get over here and sit down, pIease?
You can take it from me.
You're not just a fIash in the pan.
It wouId be very easy for me... to trade on my Iooks just Iike that... but I have some serious acting ambitions.
You shouId.
I think you're great in aII the funny movies.
Thank you.
ReaIIy, I was thinking you shouId pIay... some of the more heroic parts.
I want to. I teII my agent that a hundred times!
You couId pIay, Iike,
DanieI Boone or someone--
Lindbergh.
You'd be wonderfuI as Lindbergh.
-You are a mind reader.
-You had the same thought?
I'm on the verge of signing for that part.
-I am ! I can taste it.
-ReaIIy?
You'II be wonderfuI!
There's something inside you.
You have that same kind of Ione heroic quaIity.
You're exactIy right.
Everyone has been teIIing me not to--you are right.
Don't you Iisten.
BasicaIIy, I have been a Ioner my entire Iife.
Sure, anyone can see that.
You're deep and probabIy compIicated.
-Can I buy you Iunch?
-Me?
PIease. Can I?
I Iove taIking to you.
I was going upstairs--
Come on.
I open myseIf up around you.
Have you ever been to HoIIywood?
Come on. Of course not.
I wouId Iove to just take you around HoIIywood.
-Can I make a confession?
-Sure.
My reaI name is not GiI Shepherd.
It's Herman Bardebedian.
ReaIIy?
Yeah. I've been a cab driver--
Boy, do you have a pretty face.
-Come on.
-You do!
Hi, big boy.
Are you aIone?
HeIIo.
I'm aIone for now... but Iater I have an appointment-- or shouId I say, rendezvous.
Good for you.
Where'd you get the funny suit?
What, this?
You coming from a costume party?
No. I'm Tom Baxter of the Chicago Baxters-- expIorer, poet, adventurer.
Just back from Cairo, where I searched in vain... for the Iegendary PurpIe Rose.
How about that?
Who are you?
My name's Emma.
That's IoveIy.
What do you do?
I'm a working girI.
And what do you do, you deIicate creature?
Anything that'II make a buck.
We Baxters never reaIIy had to worry about money.
I'II bet. You want to come aIong with me?
Where to, Emma?
Where I work. I think you might have a good time.
Sounds enchanting.
I'm up for new experiences.
I may be abIe to heIp.
Hi, girIs. This is Tom.
Hi there, Iadies.
Don't you aII Iook enticing?
I know what you want.
You want to be the great white hunter... and you want me to be the tiger.
I don't get it.
You wiII if you can afford it.
I met Tom out at the amusement park.
That's my hat.
I was thinking about something.
I can imagine.
Two of us at the same time?
I was thinking about very deep things--
God and his reIation with
Irving Sachs and R.H. Levine.
And I was thinking about Iife in generaI-- the origin of everything we see about us... the finaIity of death... and how aImost magicaI it seems in the reaI worId... as opposed to the worId of ceIIuIoid... and fIickering shadows.
Where did you find this cIown?
For exampIe, the miracIe of birth.
Now, I suppose some of you
IoveIy Iadies are married.
Not anymore.
The absoIuteIy astonishing miracIe of chiIdbirth... with aII its attendant feeIings of humanity and pathos.
I stand in awe of existence.
Do you want to tie me up?
Tie you up?
That's very funny.
She's very funny.
Nice sense of humor-- the absurd non sequitur.
-What's your name, sweetheart?
-Martha.
That's the same name as the ambassador's wife.
Why didn't you bring the ambassador by?
He's stiII up on the screen.
But do you share my sense of wonderment... at the very fabric of being?
The smeII of a rose, reaI food, sensuous music?
I've got a chiId.
You do? I see.
You're a widow. Poor thing.
I got two kids, and he's right about giving birth.
It is a beautifuI experience.
I never had a baby.
I was pregnant, but I Iost it.
I'm sorry to hear that.
It aIways makes me cry to think about it.
There, there.
You'II have another chance.
Come on.
I'd be surprised... if aII you Iadies weren't married soon... especiaIIy by the way you dress.
It's so seductive to a man.
You Iike these stockings, Tom?
They're just divine.
What kind of a cIub is this, anyhow?
God, you're a scream.
He's terribIy sweet.
He is. I wouIdn't mind doing him for nothing.
Me, neither. PIus, he's cute.
You can count me in. Come on.
We're gonna take you into the bedroom... and give you an experience you'II never forget.
And it's on us.
I came here for a new experience.
You're gonna get a champion roII in the hay.
What, there's hay in the bedroom?
You ever been to a brotheI before?
What's a brotheI?
You must be kidding.
A brotheI-- a bordeIIo, a whorehouse.
I'm not foIIowing. What?
We go to bed with you and make Iove, and you pay us.
OnIy, because you're so sweet, we want to treat you to a party.
ReaIIy?
Boy, this doesn't ring a beII with anything I know.
Come on, buddy.
You know about making Iove, don't you?
I can't make Iove with you.
Don't teII me you don't Iike women.
Or you were wounded in the war.
No, I'm in Iove with someone eIse.
We're not taIking about in Iove.
We're taIking about making Iove.
But I Iove CeciIia.
So what? Marry CeciIia.
This is just for fun.
I couIdn't do that.
Ladies! My gracious!
Don't think I'm not appreciative of your offer... though I must say the concept is totaIIy new to me... but I'm just hopeIessIy head-over-heeIs in Iove... with CeciIia.
She is aII I want.
My devotion is to her, my IoyaIties.
Every breath she takes makes my heart dance.
This guy just kiIIs me.
Are there any other guys
Iike you out there?
Lawson's Music Store.
This store's been here since I was a kid.
I wish I couId pIay an instrument.
That's my other ambition in Iife... is to be a great cIassicaI vioIinist... thousands cheering me night after night.
-I can pIay the ukuIeIe.
-You can?
My father taught me before he ran away.
I'm AIabamy bound
There'II be no heebie-jeebies hangin' round
Just gave the meanest ticket man on earth
AII I'm worth
To put my tootsies in an upper berth
Just hear that choo-choo sound
Whoo whoo!
I know that soon we're gonna cover ground
And then I'II hoIIer
'cause the worId wiII know
Here I go
I'm AIabamy bound
Whoa!
I'm AIabamy bound
-That was wonderfuI!
-Thanks.
That's Iike a dream.
Listen.
My baby Ioves me
I don't know nobody
As happy as we
She's onIy 20
And I'm 21
We never worry
We're just havin' fun
Bum bum bum
Sometimes we quarreI
And maybe we fight
But then we make up
The foIIowing night
When we're together
We're great company
I Iove my baby
And my baby Ioves me
That was wonderfuI!
After the Lindbergh movie, you shouId do a musicaI.
I did have one bit in one once.
I saw ''Dancing Doughboys.''
''Dancing Doughboys''!
You remembered!
That was great.
You turned to Ina BeasIey and said...
''I won't be going south with you this winter.''
That's exac--Right.
''I won't be going south with you this winter.
''We have a IittIe score to settIe...
''on the other side of the AtIantic.''
''Does this mean I won't be seeing you ever again?''
''Ever is a Iong time.''
''When you Ieave, don't Iook back.''
You remember it perfectIy.
Then I took her in my arms and I kissed her... knowing it was for the Iast time.
God, you're beautifuI.
Was it fun kissing Ina BeasIey?
It was a movie kiss.
We professionaIs can put that stuff on just Iike that.
It Iooked Iike you Ioved her.
Oh, my goodness.
FeeI my heart.
I bet--I shouId--
Thank you so much for the ukuIeIe.
Don't be offended.
I didn't mean--
I'm not offended.
I'm just confused.
I'm married.
I just met a wonderfuI new man.
He's fictionaI, but you can't have everything.
Can I see you Iater?
No. I'm meeting Tom.
My own creation pIagues me.
-Anything happening out there?
-Not a thing.
Life is amazing, isn't it?
One IittIe minor character, takes some action... and the whoIe worId is turned upside-down.
What if he never comes back?
We just drift tiII they shut the projector.
WiII you shut up? Stop that.
He'II be back. I feeI it.
I don't want to sit around and wait.
That's exactIy what they want.
-Who?
-The bosses.
Look at us! Sitting around, sIaves to some stupid scenario.
MeanwhiIe, the fat cats in HoIIywood... are getting rich on our work-- studio heads, writers, movie stars.
Stop it!
But we're the ones who sweat!
We're the characters on the screen, not them !
You're a Red.
I say unite, brothers, and take action!
-What possibIe action?
-Shut up and sit down!
Wait a minute!
Shut up, wiII you?
What if aII this is mereIy a matter of semantics?
How can it be semantics?
Wait a minute.
Let's just readjust our definitions.
Let's redefine ourseIves as the reaI worId... and them as the worId of iIIusion and shadow. You see?
We're reaIity, they're a dream.
You'd better caIm down.
You've been up on the screen fIickering too Iong.
It's confirmed.
It is?
I was afraid this might happen.
The Tom Baxter character... tried Ieaving the screen in four theaters--
St. Louis, Chicago,
Denver, and Detroit... and he aImost made it in Detroit.
It Iooks bad.
Those movie houses are in a state of pandemonium.
There's no way to keep the Iid on it.
I see hundreds of Iawsuits.
We better puII the picture out of reIease.
What, in those towns?
Everywhere.
Something's obviousIy gone very wrong here... and the best course of action is to shut down... take our Iosses, and get out of this mess... before it reaIIy gets out of hand.
Can you imagine hundreds of
Tom Baxters fIying around wiId?
And you responsibIe for every one of them.
The best thing to do is to quit whiIe there's... onIy of them out there, but what do we do about him?
We gotta get him back in the picture... then we turn off the projector and burn the prints.
And the negative.
What a shame.
It was such a good picture.
I missed you. You're Iate.
I'm sorry. I came as quickIy as I couId.
I Iove you.
Thank you.
My feeIings are so jumbIed.
I know. You're married, and you're oId-fashioned... and I'm a whoIe new idea.
But the truth is, you're unhappiIy married... and I'm gonna take you away from aII this.
I know you Iove me.
I do Iove you.
Don't you share my feeIings?
That's just it.
You're some kind of phantom.
Look, I don't want to taIk anymore... about what's reaI and what's iIIusion.
Life's too short to spend time thinking about Iife.
-Let's just Iive it.
-Live it how?
We'II begin with dinner.
Listen, no.
I've onIy got a few doIIars.
We're not gonna use your money.
That's aII we have, unIess you've done something.
Say no more.
The moon wiII be fuII, the stars wiII be out.
We're going stepping.
-But we're broke.
-Leave that to me.
It's him !
You're back!
I want you to meet my fiancee CeciIia.
WeII, you know aII these peopIe.
It's not possibIe.
I'm in the worId of the possibIe.
You better get back in the story, you IittIe weaseI.
You anticipate me.
FoIIow me. Trust me.
He just comes and goes Iike he pIeases.
-Come on.
-Where am I?
-She can't be in here.
-Why not? Come on.
My money's good up here.
I feeI Iike I'm fIoating on air.
It upsets the baIance!
What's the difference?
He's back, isn't he?
I toId you he'd be back.
Can we get on with the pIot now?
How can we with her here?
She's here with me.
I'II sock any man in the jaw who makes her feeI unwanted.
It's about time you got back.
AII right. Now we finaIIy go to the Copacabana.
None of us have eaten in ages.
Good. I'm bringing a guest.
Won't Kitty Haynes be surprised.
TabIe for seven, pIease, Arturo.
Yes, sir. Seven?
Seven.
That's impossibIe.
It's aIways six.
We have an extra.
Seven, Arturo.
This person?
So Iet's not speak of Iove subIime
Because time brings on a breakup
There'II be no tears and no emotionaI scenes
To spoiI my make-up
And when the end comes,
I'II take up the sIack...
WouId you Iike some more champagne?
Thank you.
Listen, I don't know what they're charging you... but those champagne bottIes are fiIIed with ginger aIe.
That's the movies, kid.
I don't care.
I Iove every minute of it.
...Domesticating
Every Sunday, Monday
One day at a time
Let's take it one day at a time
Let's take it one day at a time
Bravo!
Bravo!
Thank you.
Who are you?
I came with Tom.
You sing so beautifuIIy.
What the heII is this?
We're supposed to meet and marry.
-Who's the skirt?
-My fiancee.
He met her in New Jersey.
-What is this?
-Kitty, she's reaI.
Quick!
Pour ginger aIe over her.
What's aII the fuss about?
Nothing, Arturo.
We were just Ieaving.
Leaving where?
I'm aII mixed up.
I'm going to show
CeciIia the town.
Are we chucking out the pIot?
ExactIy.
Every man for himseIf.
Then I don't have to seat peopIe anymore.
I can do what it is
I've aIways wanted to do!
What's that?
Hit it, boys!
I had such a wonderfuI time.
Me, too.
Where are aII the others?
I don't know. ProbabIy just stiII dancing away.
Why, does it matter?
I wanted to get you aIone.
It's so beautifuI here.
The white teIephone.
I've dreamed of having a white teIephone.
Your dreams are my dreams.
My whoIe Iife, I've wondered what it wouId be Iike... to be this side of the screen.
You see that city out there waking up?
That's yours for the asking.
My heart's beating so fast.
GiI, what are you doing here?
I came in here to think.
What are you doing here?
I took her on a date.
AII right?
Can't you just Ieave us aIone?
I can't Ieave her aIone.
I'm jeaIous.
You're jeaIous?
What do you want me to say?
I can't get CeciIia out of my mind.
GiI, do you mean that?
For God's sake, wouId you go back to HoIIywood, pIease?
I'm embarrassed to admit it.
You said I had a magicaI gIow, but it's you.
You're the one that has one.
And even though we've just met...
I know that this is the reaI thing.
You can't be in Iove with CeciIia.
She's in Iove with me!
Why don't you turn around and re-enter the fiIm?
I'm never going back!
I can't beIieve it.
They're at it again.
WiII you get back up here?
See, there you go.
You're ruining everything.
You're the one who's ruining everything.
If it wasn't for me, there wouIdn't be any you.
Don't be so sure.
I couId have been pIayed... by Frederick March or LesIie Howard.
You're wrong.
The part's too insignificant... to attract a major star.
Insignificant?
Like heII it is!
What are you taIking about?
I'm not a minor character.
Jeez. You know,
I haven't been abIe... to think of anything since we've met.
I have to have some time with you... to show you what reaI Iife can be Iike... if two peopIe reaIIy care for each other.
Last week, I was unIoved.
Now two peopIe Iove me, and it's the same two peopIe.
Go with the reaI guy, honey.
We're Iimited.
Go with Tom. He's got no fIaws.
Go with somebody, chiId!
'Cause I's gettin' bored.
She's going to marry me.
You're wasting your time.
WiII you get back on the screen?
I'm trying to teII CeciIia
I'm in Iove with her.
I Iove you.
I'm honest, dependabIe, courageous, romantic... and a great kisser.
And I'm reaI.
Let's go, CeciIia.
Choose one of them so we can settIe this thing.
The most human of aII attributes is your abiIity to choose.
Wait a minute.
If she chooses Tom... how are we gonna end the story?
We'II be stuck here forever.
Father DonneIIy can marry us right here in the movie house.
That won't stand up in court.
The priest has to be human.
The BibIe never says a priest can't be on fiIm.
I'm aIready married.
Come away with me to HoIIywood.
Just Iike that?
Do something impuIsive for once in your Iife.
Just throw your stuff in a vaIise and come away with me.
ReaIIy. And don't forget that ukuIeIe.
What ukuIeIe?
Look, I Iove you.
I know that onIy happens in movies, but I do.
CeciIia, you're throwing away perfection!
Don't teII her that.
We need Tom back!
-It's so romantic!
-Women!
I'm crushed. Devastated.
Try to understand.
You'II be fine. In your worId... things have a way of aIways working out right.
I'm a reaI person.
No matter how tempted I am,
I have to choose the reaI worId.
I Ioved every minute with you.
I'II never forget our night on the town.
Good-bye.
You're better off with us, oId sport.
You reaIIy are.
Can we get on with
''The PurpIe Rose of Cairo''?
Anyone wants me,
I'II be in reeI six.
Kitty's waiting for you.
Lord, have mercy!
What a day!
Your expIorer friend's OK.
I saw him waIking around town with you.
He's OK, no thanks to you.
I didn't mean to be so rough on him.
It's just that I get jeaIous when it comes to you.
Do you?
Christ, you know I do.
I know I treat you rough.
It's my way.
It doesn't mean
I don't feeI for you.
What are you doing?
Leaving.
Here we go again.
You don't feeI for me.
AII you feeI for is yourseIf... your beer, your card games, your women.
OK. I'm gonna turn over a new Ieaf.
It's too Iate. I'm going.
I shouId have
Ieft a Iong time ago.
I wouId've, except I was scared of being aIone.
So, what now?
You found some chump... who's fiIIing your head with big ideas.
No. I got a chance to change my Iife.
I'm moving to HoIIywood.
Now, Iisten,
I said I was sorry... about being rough with your friend, but Iet's shape up.
It's too Iate!
Like heII it is... and don't be giving me that big-headed stuff, you hear?
Because I'm the guy that can sIap you down.
Go ahead and hit me.
Just go ahead!
I'm Ieaving anyway!
This never wouId've happened if you didn't meet that guy.
That's probabIy right... and we wouId have gone on the same way...
'tiI we were too oId to hope for something better.
But I did meet him.
And I have feeIings for him.
And he has for me.
What about me?
I stiII care for you, if you can beIieve that... but out of the bIue for the first time in my Iife... somebody's in Iove with me.
But you just met each other.
Love at first sight doesn't onIy happen just in the movies.
Don't go. You hear me?
Now wait a minute.
I said don't go!
-You stay here!
-Take care of yourseIf.
AII right. WeII, go.
See if I care.
Go, see what it is out there.
It ain't the movies!
It's reaI Iife, and you'II be back.
Mark my words. You'II be back!
What are you doing here?
-Meeting GiI Shepherd.
-They're aII gone.
What do you mean?
They went back to HoIIywood.
GiI, too?
Mr. Shepherd, yeah.
Soon as Tom Baxter went back up on the movie screen... couIdn't wait to get out of here.
He said this was a cIose caII for his career.
I think he's going to pIay
CharIes Lindbergh.
Don't forget, CeciIia.
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers start today.
Heaven
I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardIy speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
Heaven
I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish
Iike a gambIer's Iucky streak
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
Oh, I Iove to cIimb a mountain
And to reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thriII me haIf as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
In ignem iacto unguenta pretiosa, et mira sumio.
Tibi supplex... donem honorem!
No!
You promised! You promised not our child!
Whore! He is the one.
You can't hurt him now, you bastard!
His blood will flow.
Come.
Come.
Come.
Take him away! Forever!
Do it now.
You will take his place.
Don't be afraid, little one.
You'll be safe.
Lucifer!
Rubrum e iugulo ut tibi supplex donem honorem.
The child had been saved, so it seemed.
And I vowed that he would never know the evil from whence he was spawned.
And when his father finally died a horrible death,
I felt sure that the curse had passed forever.
I can't believe you inherited this place.
I know. Me neither.
I suppose we'll just have to get used to the good life.
Does that mean we get to hire a maid and a cook?
Are you kidding?
It's gonna break me just to keep the lawn mowed.
Well, we could always sell it and move to Westwood.
Very funny. Very funny.
No, I like this place... I think.
What's that?
- I don't know. It looks...
- Like a grave.
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna take a look.
No, don't. It's kinda creepy-looking.
Come on, Becky. It's mine, isn't it?
I don't know. Looks sort of old.
Must have been hard growing up without a family.
I mean...
Rebecca, this is Wolfgang.
He's sort of the caretaker around here.
Wolfgang, this is Rebecca.
Hi. I...
You scared me.
Well, we'll go back to the house.
We'll see you later, Wolfgang.
So Wolfgang's the only family
I've ever known.
Who read all these books? Your dad?
Yeah, I guess so.
The Secret World of Magic?
The Black Magic Ritual.
The Grimoire of Abra-Melin.
You all right?
You probably scared him more than he scared you.
Hey, I'll tell you what.
Why don't you start cleaning the upstairs and I'll work on the downstairs?
What do you say?
OK. But if there are any more rats the deal's off.
I've been thinking.
About having a party.
- Here?
- Sure. Why not?
It's not like anybody could wreck the place or anything.
Whoa!
This is it! Eddie, Eddie.
They got food.
Eddie, these are my friends.
They love me, man.
- And this is where they're at.
- That's good. That's real good.
But what if they're not?
Then I'll have to get some new friends.
Man, you should have seen the quim I poked last night.
I'm so unhappy.
Toad Boy needs sweetmeat for his tum.
Will you knock off that Toad Boy shit already?
Jesus!
You don't love me. You just pretend.
Shit, I can't talk to you, man.
- Hey, Dick.
- Jon.
- How you doing?
- I'm doing alright.
It's him I'm worried about.
- Hey, Mark. How you doing?
- I'm miserable.
So, wanna dance later?
Think you can handle it?
- Try me.
- I might.
I went out with Mark last night.
You're kidding.
- You mean Toad Boy?
- Don't ask me why.
No, things were really nice, they were, but then he just got so weird.
Do you think he's a virgin?
I don't know.
But I certainly know who isn't.
Hey, Rebecca.
Can you lead me to the nearest beer?
In the refrigerator.
Thanks.
So... Who's your beautiful friend?
- I'm Donna.
- They call me Dick.
But you can call me... Dick.
Break dance!
I think I busted my head.
Oh, thank God.
I thought that you really hurt yourself.
What do you guys wanna do?
We could play hide-and-go-seek.
Yeah!
What about Trivial Pursuit?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Why don't we just play charades?
Yeah.
- Strip poker.
- Yeah.
No way.
All right!
I got an idea. Let's do a ritual.
You guys, it's kinda spooky in here.
Alright, everybody listen up.
I want everybody to take a sip. Go ahead.
I'm gonna draw a circle and I want you all to stay inside it.
Go on, man.
So now what are you doin'?
I'm gonna conjure up a spirit, and it's gonna appear right here in this triangle.
Yeah. OK.
I believe you.
Jonathan, how do you know how to do that?
I don't know.
I must have read it in a book.
Rebecca, take the rock and put it at the north point of the circle.
Where?
Take the candle and put it at the south point.
Right there.
Yod hay vau hay.
Yod hay vau hay.
Yod hay vau hay.
Yod hay vau hay.
You do the hokey-pokey and you turn yourself around.
Hey, knock it off!
Ateh malkuth... ve-gedulah ve-geburah... le-olahm. Amen.
Te nunc transforma in formam veram quod eludet species mentem meam.
Shut up, goddammit!
I'm sorry. Jeez.
O Surgat, I conjure thee... that thou come before this circle immediately and agree to obey my orders.
Come, I order thee in the name of the most Holy Trinity.
I order thee to manifest thyself at once, without injury to me or any other in this room.
Come, I order thee.
Come, I order thee, in the name of the most Holy Trinity.
Come, I order thee.
Well, that was fun.
Yeah, let's go get another beer.
Nice try, Jon.
- Where's Robin?
- I don't know.
Maybe the toad monster got her.
I don't think that's very funny.
Well, she's not the kind who would just leave.
Honey, I think we'd better go find her.
Yeah, come on.
No, no, wait.
I need to dismiss the spirit.
So do I. Where's the bathroom?
Upstairs.
Come on.
- Robin?
- Hey, Robin!
Jeez!
Dude.
- Dude.
- What?
I don't think she's in here.
Well, I don't think so either.
Hey, let's...
- Check out the closet.
- Check out the closet.
You bozo!
- Hey, Mike. Mike.
- What?
Wasn't he over there?
I don't think she's here.
Robin! Hey, Robin. Where are you?
Hey, Robin.
Robin! Hey, come on.
There she is.
Hey, Robin, what are you doing?
Robin.
Robin?
- You OK?
- Yeah, I guess so.
Come on, little girl.
I'll have you feelin' better in no time.
- I made a big decision today.
- What?
Well... I decided to withdraw from school this quarter.
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.
Listen, I just think
I should take some time off.
Stay home and fix this place up.
Look, I walked around this place all day today.
I thought of all these great things I could do.
Terrific, but can't you just wait until you've graduated to fix up the house?
No, I can't wait.
I got this urge to do it now.
Look, when I inherited this house,
I inherited a lot of responsibility.
I'm just trying to do things right.
I want this to be a nice home for both of us.
This place is gonna need work and
I can't do it if I'm going to school full time.
You understand?
Yeah, I understand.
I just want good things for you.
I know.
And so it had begun.
The evil one willing the boy on, using the boy's curiosity as a powerful weapon.
I could but sit and wait, gripped by the fear of events foreshadowed.
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hi. How did it go today?
See for yourself.
I can't believe it.
You know something?
I'm really proud of you.
Wait. There's more.
Open it.
It's really beautiful.
- What is it?
- It's a talisman.
It'll protect you from...
- From what?
- From everything.
Even my physics professor?
Mr. Bolton? Yes, especially him.
You never take it off, okay?
I promise. I love it.
Jonathan?
Dinner's ready!
Jonathan?
Are you OK? You look terrible.
I'm fine.
- Well, come and have dinner.
- No. I'm not eating.
- Why not?
- I'm...
I'm fasting.
You're fasting?
Jonathan, I don't know what you're up to, but I just cooked dinner for us.
So you can do whatever the hell you wanna do.
O Paimon, I conjure thee.
Empowered with the strength of the greatest power.
I command thee, creature of the water, bring forth life unto this world.
I command thee, come. At once!
Welcome to this world.
I am your master.
You may roam about the grounds, but you must remain invisible to all but me.
Remain obedient to me at all times.
Understood?
I call upon thee, Vepar, and thee, Procel, and thee, Ashtaroth.
Bring forth the fury of thy tempest before me.
With these words:
Non humus somnifera exsulat ignis et que erat.
Somnifera facta sunt.
Come. Now!
Show me thy might!
Come now, that I might anoint myself with thy power!
Yes! Come now!
Yes! Yes!
Thank you, Vepar, Procel, Ashtaroth, for having appeared and for having fulfilled my request.
Thou mayest depart in peace.
Ye shall return when I call upon thee.
Now, indeed you are a powerful instrument.
Jonathan?
What are you doing?
Rebecca. You're home early.
Would you please tell me what's going on here?
I get it.
Oh, no. Don't change for me.
I will leave you here to do whatever it is you're doing, and I will go upstairs and make dinner for myself, since you're not even eating these days.
- No, Becky, wait.
- No, don't!
Becky, listen to me! Becky, come on, wait!
Rebecca.
Look, will you listen...
Look, talk to me.
What the hell's going on here, Jonathan?
You tell me that you wanna drop out of school so that you can fix up the house.
- Right?
- Right.
So I come home and I find you... in the middle of I don't even know what.
- Why'd you lie to me?
- I didn't lie to you.
I have been working on the house.
That's all I've been doing.
Look, I got sidetracked.
I figure this stuff has got something to do with my parents.
I don't know who they were, so I'm curious.
Don't you understand that?
No, I don't understand it, Jonathan.
That's just the problem.
I don't understand.
Don't do this to me.
When I walked in that room, I saw someone that I didn't even know.
I saw... a stranger.
Rebecca, please.
Look, it's nothing. Honest.
Look, I'll cut it out. I swear.
Rebecca, I love you.
You know that.
I just get scared, that's all.
It's the last time you'll hear anything about it.
I swear.
Hi.
Hi.
- Rebecca.
- Hm?
I love you.
Well, I love you, too.
What are you saying?
What are you saying?
What? Jonathan.
What are you saying?
Jonathan. What are you doing?
Stop it! Jonathan!
What are you doing?
You bastard!
- Becky.
- No, that's it. I've had it.
- Listen...
- No, you listen to me.
I've had it with your black magic, your rituals, your lies, everything.
Goodbye, Jonathan.
Leviatan, Ermogasa, Vmirteat, lorantga.
Agtnaroi, Taetrimv, Asagomre, Nataivel.
Leviatan, Ermogasa, Vmirteat, lorantga.
Agtnaroi, Taetrimv, Asagomre, Nataivel!
- We are here, Master.
- What would you have of us?
I will have you serve me.
That precisely...
Is why you've called us, Master.
- And we will.
- Most faithfully.
Forsaking all others... you will obey me?
- Unquestioningly.
- We are yours.
Drink.
How may we drink?
If you do not release us from the triangle.
If you are worthy to serve me, you will drink.
If you are not worthy, you will burn.
The choice is yours.
- Me. Me first.
- No, me. Me first.
Excellent. Well done.
What are your names?
- I'm called Grizzel.
- And I am called Greedigut.
- And who am I?
- You are Jonathan.
Our master. What is it you wish, Master?
Knowledge. And power.
These things we can do.
What about Rebecca?
Do you want her as well?
You know of Rebecca?
We know of many things, O Master.
- Yes, I want her.
- Then you shall have her.
As for the other things you wish...
There must be a master ritual.
And there must be seven others besides yourself.
When the moon is full.
The ritual is fraught with danger, Master.
- Don't speak of it.
- What?
- Answer me now!
- The ritual is dangerous.
But you must perform it if you wish to achieve knowledge.
And power.
And power.
What do you want?
You. I want you.
I want you to come away with me now, tonight, away from this house.
No. Never.
I could never leave this place.
Your eyes.
What have you done to your eyes?
It's a sign. A sign of power.
I don't want this.
I love you, Jonathan, but I'm leaving.
It's over!
Becky, I love you.
I'm so sorry, Jonathan.
Please forgive me.
The evil one had him now.
The things that would be unleashed that night were to be horrific.
And I was powerless to stop it.
What is that? Mushroom dip?
There's a lot of it.
- Nice house.
- It's really nice.
Really grand, you know.
It's really special.
I really feel so wonderful.
You've invited me here and all that.
You know what?
You're a prince, an earl.
A prince among earls.
King of the soirée.
Bad manners, dude.
I'm sorry. Rebecca, I'm really sorry.
- Small faux pas.
- Don't worry about it, Mark.
You know what they say:
A faux pas a day helps keep your friends away.
- I'm really sorry.
- Mark, it's OK.
No, it's not...
How come you and Jonathan aren't eating?
We ate already.
Rebecca, why don't you sit down?
All right, darling.
Tell me, why are we wearing these ridiculous glasses?
I can barely see what I'm eating.
It's all part of the evening
I have planned.
It's gonna be great.
A toast.
To my friends. Forgive me.
Mesabim, Etosa.
Boros, Azote,
Drink.
Queladim!
Come.
Recabustira, Cabustira, Bustira, Tira, Ta.
Hear me, all you hosts gathered here.
Give me the knowledge.
I will have the wisdom and the power!
Answer me, my friends.
Beseder, Eliele.
Sepped, Eliele.
Beseder, Eliele.
Sepped, Eliele.
Beseder, Eliele!
Sepped, Eliele.
Beseder, Eliele!
Sepped, Eliele.
- Beseder, Eliele!
- Sepped, Eliele.
- Beseder, Eliele!
- Sepped, Eliele.
Sepped, Eliele.
Sepped, Eliele. Sepped, Eliele.
By the force of these terrible words of power...
Aglon! Tetragram! Retragrammaton!
Soter Emanuel! Te invoco!
A toast. To my friends.
Rebecca and I are going to retire early.
You're welcome to spend the night.
The house is yours. Just pick a room.
- Wine cellar.
- Oh! You madman. Yeah!
- Good night, everyone.
- Good night.
So... can't wait to pick a room.
Children, your true master has returned, and tonight you will do my bidding.
Baby, I've been waiting for this moment ever since we met.
All right!
Mark, would you hurry up?
God, it's kinda spooky out here.
Wasn't Rebecca acting kind of weird at dinner?
I mean, the way she looked at me when I...
- Gotcha!
- God!
Come on. Let's sit down.
Come on over here. Come on.
- Right here.
- That wasn't funny.
Sorry.
- Nice night.
- Spooky.
Is that a little girl's tum?
Don't, Mark! You're tickling me!
Please stop! Please stop!
Sounds like Toad Boy's on the attack.
Mark!
My... Mark, my bracelet.
Don't worry. I shall retrieve it.
I can't see anything.
Yuck! I touched something weird.
Mark.
What the hell's in there?
Man, that chick is really a screamer.
Where are you going?
Water. Want some?
No, thanks.
- I'll be back.
- I'll be waiting.
Who are you?
Come here.
No doubt about it, Mr. Dick.
You are a lucky guy.
Who are you?
You got any matches?
- Yeah. I got reserves.
- Great.
You got any that work? Jeez!
Well, there's gotta be some around here.
I'll be back.
I'm sorry, Rebecca.
I'm sorry I had to do it this way.
But it worked.
It'll all be worth it. You'll see.
I just hope you can forgive me.
Jonathan?
What am I...?
I'll tell you about it in the morning.
Yeah, I'm so tired.
Sleep now.
Matches.
Matches...
Matches...
Nah.
No, don't do it here.
- Outside.
- Yes, all right.
Pull!
Shit.
Where's that guy?
There it is. Get it.
- I despise these creatures.
- Quiet!
Malcolm is the master, blast his soul.
He always has been and will be until you rot.
No, it is not so.
I cannot do this thing. I cannot.
Ooh! Oh! Ow! Oh!
Quiet. Quiet. He'll burn us both.
Hey, dude. Don't bogart that joint.
Come to me. Come to me, my children.
All of you.
Let me show you my love.
Come to me now.
Jonathan?
Oh, boy. What a dream.
Why, Jonathan? Why?
Becky!
No!
Becky?
No.
Becky.
My God.
I can make you live. I've got the power.
Becky.
Where's my robe? Where the hell's my robe?
Aren't you going to greet your father?
You did my bidding well, Jonathan.
You...
Grizzel, Greedigut.
You tricked me. I'm your master.
No! I am the master.
I own them as I now own you.
Come... and greet your father.
Vepar, Procel, Ashtaroth. Help me now!
Where are your gods now?
They too are mine.
Not bad.
Although at your age I was much better.
You...
You killed them.
You killed Rebecca.
Hm?
Yes, I suppose I did.
But it was you I really wanted, Jonathan.
You were to resurrect me.
And what should have happened
25 years ago will happen now.
I will have your youth, Jonathan.
Greater things command all of us, Jonathan.
I suppose that in another time, another place,
I could have loved you as my son.
My soul is not my own, and you must be my sacrifice to Lucifer.
Again... a good effort.
But it is your love that weakens you, Jonathan.
You can never oppose me.
A shame.
She's so pretty.
May you rot!
- Becky.
- Jonathan.
Forgive me.
I love you, Jonathan. Please.
Take me away from here. Take me.
Hold me.
Kiss me.
I love you.
- Oh, Becky. I'm so sorry.
- It's all right, my love.
Come to me.
No, Master Jonathan. Don't listen.
It's a trap, yes!
No!
You little worms!
You shall burn for this later.
But now... I am tired of playing.
You try my patience.
You are my life... and I will have my life!
Kiss me, my son.
Kiss me.
Let me drain the life from your lips.
You will not have the boy's life!
You are no match for me, old man.
Die, evil one!
Get out of here while you still can!
No. No.
Dick, come on, wake up.
We gotta get outta here.
- Come on! Let's go.
- Jonathan. How?
Don't ask.
- Mark, what's going on?
- Just get in the car.
You got a cigarette on you?
Would somebody mind telling me what the hell is going on?
It's a long story, Mike.
But it's over now.
Is it, Jonathan? Is it really?
Yeah, really.
The secret, old man.
Tell me, and I shall let you live!
It is my right as your eldest son.
I demand the key to the ancient power!
The ancient power must never fall into the hands of the Devil's agents.
Father!
Father!
Then let the secret die...
...now!!!
Voltan!
Father!
Father.
The prophecy's fulfilled, my son.
The evil I have spawned...
...will now pollute the land.
I have much to tell you...
...and so little time.
Take the pouch from my neck.
The Great Sword.
Place it... between us.
Empty the pouch into your hand.
Look“.
...look into the heart of the stone.
Quick! The coldness of death is in my limbs.
The last... Elfin Mindstone...
Think... of the Great Sword in your hand...
...and it will be so.
The Mindsword is now yours, my son.
Father.
Voltan!
You will die!
By the Sword.
Quick! Sister - help me get him inside.
Sister Monica - help me to remove these rags.
- Oh!
- God in Heaven!
What's happend to his hands?
He's got no fingers!
Left on some battlefield - with the rest of the hand.
With the help of God - and a sharp knife...
...we may yet save the rest of the arm from infection.
Come, Master Ranulf. It is time for you to eat.
Where am I?
You are under the protection of Caddonbury...
...with the Sisterhood of the Holy Word.
How did you know my name?
You were delirious for a long time...
...and you spoke of many things.
Some... so terrible they passed our understanding.
I could not save the hand.
But the arm has healed.
What happened, my son?
...village to the south was attacked by raiders - led by the devil himself.
That devil...
...burned our homes to the ground...
...and as the men, women...
...and children...
...tried to escape from the flames...
...they hacked them to pieces...
...laughing, as they did so.
God.
How they laughed.
I... was the only one to escape.
God forgive me.
What sort of man...
...would kill innocents?
I heard them call his name.
Voltan!
The Dark One!
Wizard!
Help me!
Wizard!
You promised me all...
...in return for my...
...sword-arm!!!
Enter, Dark One.
The pain - it gets worse.
Each time it gets worse.
Your face does not heal.
A strange malady affects the flesh.
It is beyond all skill...
...to render a permanent cure.
Steel yourself.
Your face will not pain you for a while...
...but you will need the crystal again.
There is one who stands between us...
...and the final victory.
You will prepare the way for his death!
We pray for care and compassion.
For the love that is freely given and joyfully received.
Blessed is the Word...
...and doubly blessed are the true---
This is a house of God.
Your weapons have no place here.
I am told, woman...
...that your Church holds you in high esteem?
I am but a humble servant of God...
...like my sisters here beside me.
We are here solely to assist those who most need our help.
We would like you to help us, old woman.
My son, Drogo, speaks true.
How can I help you?
What do you want?
I, Voltan, want you...
...old woman.
I know your name.
Killer of women and innocent children.
You are a servant of evil.
But in this church, we have no fear of you.
I am pleased that you know of me.
It will make my task that much easier.
Seize her.
No!!!
Let her go.
No!
Leave him.
He will live to serve my purpose.
Our lady is needed here.
Why do you take her from us?
For the gold that lies in the fat coffers of your Hon Fortress.
Go tell them...
...for two thousand pieces of gold they can buy her freedom.
I shall return when next the moon is full.
The gold had best be here.
If not---
Ah!
You are a warrior.
Tell us what to do?
Pay the... the ransom.
That is impossible.
The Church has decreed that no ransom...
...can ever be paid to any of its order.
What happens to us is the Will of God.
Will of God?!
I know this man!
I've seen what he can do - he'll take great pleasure in your Lady's death.
Oh, God, help me. I know not what to do.
You saved my arm...
...and skullface must pay for the death of my village.
Somehow... I'll get help.
Then you must go...
...you must go to the Holy
Fortress at Danesford...
...and speak to the
High Abbott, himself.
He will tell us what to do.
Yes?
A warrior has come from our church in Caddonbury.
He bears grave news.
Feed him and let him rest.
Then bring him to me.
The price to be paid is two thousand gold pieces - or she will be killed.
If we pay the ransom for just one of our people...
...then... all of us are at risk.
It would be one more victory for the powers of Darkness...
...if she were no longer among us.
There is one...
...who... who has helped us before.
A warrior who fought on the side of light...
...during those dark years.
If he could be found...
...he might help us.
News has reached us of his passing...
...through the northern territories a few days ago.
Now, if you should find him...
...give him this.
He'll know... that his help is needed.
By what name is this warrior called?
He is called...
...Hawk!
“OO-EE-OO-EE-OO“
She's gonna burn!
You're gonna burn, eh!
Burn!
Burn! Ha, ha!
Why do you treat the woman this way?
If it's any of your business...
...she's a witch!
And was caught practising her foul arts...
...on one of my fine hogs.
Does he speak the truth, woman?
I sought only to cure the animal of its ills.
She lies.
The pig died an hour after she touched it...
...with that devil stick!
Had you let me tend it...
...the creature would have lived.
Enough of your chatter.
This will put an end to it!
No!
Well, witch...
...it seems that you'll have company when you burn.
Kill him!
He may run like a dog...
...but not I.
Go in peace with your friend.
Or else...?
Ha.
"Or else" what, my fine friend?
“OO-EE-OO-EE-OO“
Aaargh!!!
Use your sword, pig!
Do not mock me!
The time of playing games is OVER!!!
You go in peace.
Now.
Beware!
Help me.
My cave is there - in the woods.
But first...
...hand me my staff.
By what name are you called, Lord?
Hawk.
Ah...
Yes... many times I've heard it spoken.
You fight for good.
It's the way I have chosen.
You saved my life today and I am in your debt.
How can I repay you?
I need no payment.
Wait.
Let me look into the fire.
It shows these dead eyes many things.
A one-handed man seeks you.
He carries a token.
I also see a man who wears the mask of death.
Beware of this man.
He is filled with hate.
Voltan.
Where do I find this one-handed man?
Go south, quickly - for he rides into danger.
Ranulf is his name.
You will need me again.
For the final battle has yet to be fought.
No, friend - that's not necessary.
We're travellers.
And we would know in what direction the village of Burnby lies.
To have killed our friend was a very bad mistake.
A mistake that will cost you more...
...than these few, paltry coins.
Your friend...
...was about to stick me with his arrow.
What punishment is fitting for this one-handed murderer?
Something different.
It's been a dull day.
I'm no murderer.
I was... I was protecting myself.
Argh!
Silence... scum!
A contest?
I'll wager two silver pieces that I can get closest...
...without drawing blood.
Done.
The first two pieces of silver...
...are mine.
Again!
And this time I'll raise the hairs on his head!
Cut him down.
It's you...
...who will be cut down.
The contest gets better!
What manner of man are you?
I'm called Hawk.
Hawk?
I have this for you.
You're from the Fortress?
Yes.
I've been looking for you for many days.
Innkeeper!
Tell me of the rumours again.
I swear... I swear I, I know nothing.
Nothing - nothing...
...for sure. But they say...
...that a one-armed man is searching far and wide.
Searching for what?
I know... I know not.
H swear it.
You will tell us immediately that he comes here?
Oh, yes...
Animals!
When you are in the presence of Voltan...
...you do not continue to eat.
Nor do you sit on your greasy backsides!
I rise to no man - save the man who pays my wages!
Who pays your wages this night?
My master is Sped - the Hunchback.
We are slavers on the River Shale.
And we do not take kindly to strangers...
...trying to teach us good manners!
Watch your mouth, dog!
No! I like a man with spirit!
But remember this - and remember it well.
Voltan owns everything.
The table, the chairs - the very food you eat.
I own everything - including your useless life.
Remember it well.
Your friend has lost his appetite, it seems.
The Hunchback will have something to say about this!
The Hunchback may have many things to say...
...but you have already said too much!
Cut the tongue from his head - it tires me!
I trust you have learned something from this?
I expect to be kept informed...
...of any strangers passing this way.
Or...
...of any unusual occurence.
Do you understand?
- Yes.
- Yes. YES!
Noooooooooo!!
Tell me again of the
Dark One's demands?
Two thousand pieces of gold for the Abbess' safe return.
Have you ever crossed swords with him?
A fine thing for us to do on our wedding day.
The guests will wonder where we have gone.
Voltan!
You're not enjoying the festivities?
How could I enjoy them when these festivities...
...should have been for my marriage to Eliane?
Eliane was never your betrothed.
She had a free choice.
While I have fought alongside our father, you were here...
...turning her love for me to hate with your silvery tongue.
You and I were friends.
Nothing more.
I love your brother - as he loves me.
Cannot you find happiness in your heart for our marriage?
No...
...NO!
You were mine once - and will be again!
Take care, little brother.
Watch for me in the night.
He has changed.
And it frightens me.
His mind has turned in on itself.
Wear it.
It will protect you.
When I had Voltan in my sights...
...I should have fired.
The black ones protect their own.
Our horses have rested enough.
We have others to find.
Comrades who have fought by my side before.
We have little time left.
There is one who will find them for us...
...but the way lies through the Forest of Weir.
Huh?
The shortest route, my friend, is often the most dangerous.
Beyond those gates will be as darkest night...
...but the Mind Sword shall light our way.
Leave this circle of light and I may be powerless to help you.
The ones we seek are the last of their kind.
Gort...
...a giant from the mountains at the edge of the world.
Crow...
...an elfin bowman from the Silver Forest...
...now burnt and blackened.
And Baldin...
...a dwarf from the Iron Hills.
The land has changed.
Wolves hunt where there were none before.
This was once a green forest - full of sunlight.
Now it's a place of darkness and evil.
Ride! Yah! Yah!
Woman?
Enter, Lord Hawk.
And bring the one-handed one with you.
Sit.
I need your help.
With the help of my powers...
...you shall journey to where each man is.
...and if he is willing...
...he will return here with you.
First the giant.
I kept my side of the bargain.
You've drunk enough of my ale for three men.
Part of the bargain.
First, the beer.
Then there was a price of two pennies mentioned.
When the task was completed.
You 'aven't even started yet.
Pay up, rat nose.
Ah. Well now, you see, I, uh...
...I-I never carry any money with me...
...002, like, there's all them thieves about.
Ah. Uh... I'll give you the money tomorrow.
All right? Yes -
I'll 'ave it 'ere...
...first light - yeah. You can see to that.
Bag of dirt!
You strike me - you get nothing.
I'll have it here tomorrer.
Some time.
On the other 'and-—-
Uh...?
You owe me nothing now, pick-nose.
Justice!
I demand justice!
Look what this great ox has just done to my wares!
Am I an honest citizen, to be treated that way?
The ale-seller is right.
Now be a good fellow and clear up the mess you made.
I'd sooner eat cow dung.
Well... that could be arranged.
You can wash it down with your own blood if need be.
So be it.
Raargh!
Aaargh!
Consider this the luckiest day of your life, toad.
Next, the elf.
A strange individual, to be sure.
I've never seen his like before.
Well, whatever.
He's got plenty of gold, and the way he inspects those points...
...no doubt, he fancies himself as a bowman.
I'm not so sure about this one.
This has never failed yet.
Listen. You play your part, as always...
And we'll have our pockets lined with his gold before the end of the hour.
Well, go on - get rid of the blacksmith.
Good day to you, master Blacksmith.
I have a hard, but rewarding task for you.
Our wagon lies with a broken wheel a mile down the road.
If you will repair it and return it here before sunset...
...you shall be paid handsomely.
Part-payment in advance.
Hmm?
Greetings.
My friend and I could not help but notice...
...the beautiful bow and arrows you tend so lovingly.
Might one enquire if you're bound for the tournament at Brackley?
Hmm?
Permit me to introduce ourselves.
This is Ralf of Coggeshall, master Bowman...
...and I am his humble companion, Fitzwalter.
Er...
To whom do I have the pleasure of addressing myself?
Crow.
Maybe our friend only cleans bows?
Oh, dear!
I do believe my impetuous friend is challenging you.
He wastes his time and mine.
Oh, gentlemen, gentlemen - calm yourselves, I beg of you.
Our friend here's not interested in children's games.
He requires more serious inducement.
Now, for a small wager...
...we could make it worth his while.
What do you say, sir?
Hmm?
Name the target.
Hmm.
We shoot from here.
Whoever cuts their mark cleanly.
Our friend will take the red mark, Ralf.
Bows to remain couched and arrows in their quiver until I give the signal...
...“Three-two-one-shoot“.
Is that understood?
Right, gentlemen.
Three...
...Two...
...On--—
Leave the odds as they are.
Continue.
Three...
...Two...
...One...
Shoot!
My arrow hit first.
The devil it did! My arrow left the bow first.
- There's only one way to settle this.
- I forbid this.
You stay out of this, Fitzwalter.
Well, little man?
Has the quake in your belly stopped your mouth?
I am ready.
Right, Fitzwalter.
Count us down.
Three...
...Two...
...One...
Shoot!
I never even saw it.
I knew it! I knew it!!!
I knew your tongue would be the death of you!
God's blood!
I've a mind to take your gizzard out and throttle you!
Look into the flames for the last time, Lord Hawk.
One more and we are complete.
The Table of Five.
The dwarf.
Hosa me.
Hosa me.
Hosa me.
Hosa me.
Brethren.
Cut me loose, dogs!
Then I, Baldin of the Iron Hills...
...will show you what to do with your puny bows.
Be still, ugly one.
It is a great honour to you to die this way.
When the raft burns...
...your ashes will mingle with the holy waters of the lake...
...and you will become a part...
...of its sacred oneness.
Brethren.
Here I am, about to roast...
...and I sit upon enough water to put out the very fires of Hell.
Damn your holy eyes!!!
Brethren.
Lay down your bows.
By all the Gods - Hawk!
Oh, well.
This warrior is needed.
You do not understand.
By dying this way...
...he will be purified, and his soul forever cleansed.
Priest...
...I prefer him exactly the way he is.
Unwashed, but alive.
Wench'. Water'.'!
I never did like the stuff.
Greetings, Hawk.
And how did the mighty Baldin come to be in this...
...sorry mess?
Too much wine.
A friendly fight or two.
You know how it goes?
A crack on the skull from a sultry wench...
...and I wake to find myself at the mercy of these chanting fools.
There's a hole here as large as the
Pit of Gimri in the Iron Hills.
Yeurgh.
Your diet has improved little since we last met.
Ah! But the eye is just as quick.
Think again, ugly one.
Great glory could have been thine.
I'll give you "great glory"!
Ah! Brethren!
Now, you all know the fate that awaits...
...the Abbess of Caddonbury... if we fail.
Remember...
Voltan has many men and we are few.
If it comes to battle...
...it will go hard on us.
Since last I fought by your side...
...time has hung heavy.
And that's not the only thing that hangs heavy!
I yearn for the old days.
I'm with you.
The Iron Hills are no more.
If I am to die...
...why not amongst friends?
Voltan will want his gold soon.
We do not have enough riches to fill a chamber pot!
True.
How are we to tempt Voltan...
...if there is no wine in the cup?
A days' march from Caddonbury...
...is the River Shale.
Once a month, traders come with gold...
...to buy slaves from the
Hunchback, Sped.
It would be fitting justice...
...for his ill-gotten gold to be used...
...for the ways of good.
The end truly justifies the means if...
...the Lady Abbess is returned to her flock.
I have reason to doubt the word of Voltan.
I feel...
We are as one, my love.
But you're so silent.
Father worries at the news from the north.
The country is being put to the torch, and soon...
...we may be defending our own lands.
If there is to be fighting...
...then my sword will stand by yours.
Tomorrow at first light, we leave for the church at Caddonbury.
Welcome! Welcome!
Thank God you have returned safely.
This is Hawk.
He's been sent by the Lord
High Abbott to help us.
Come and sit. Get some food and drink for our friends.
Now...
...tell us - how do you propose to raise the ransom?
A day's ride from here are men...
...who will be only too happy to meet our needs.
This is good news, indeed.
Once the gold is here our
Lady will be returned.
Would it were that simple.
I know Voltan as well as I know myself.
The next one will send you to Hell, little brother.
...what sweet revenge to tell our whining...
...peace-loving father of your death.
Then will he heed my bidding!
Look well, little brother!
The last thing you will ever see is the woman you love...
...in my arms!
I will still be his!
For I would rather be dead than have your snake-hands touch me.
I loathe each breath that keeps you alive!
Sister, there is no guarantee he will return the Abbess...
...even if the ransom is paid in full.
No, no - you must not say such things.
He gave his word.
Once the money is paid...
...our sister will be returned.
What you say is too awful to contemplate!
Her head moves in the clouds, I fear.
I'll try to make her understand.
Thank you, Sister.
That will be sufficient for me.
Now, please - some food for my friends.
What is it?
Nothing.
Enjoy the food.
It probably won't affect you, in any case.
Do you know something, dwarf, that I don't?
Out with it.
It's not really important.
The food will taste just the same to you...
...believe me.
Little brother...
...you're trying my patience.
Unless you want to end up even shorter...
...your tongue had better speak quickly.
Why do you say “it will taste the same“?
Very well, then, longshanks.
So be it.
We are in a monastery.
Surely that's clear?
Even to you.
Well?
Well, all I'm saying is...
...that might be holy food.
Dammit, little brother! What does that mean, “holy food“?
Holy food has a flavour that...
...some find not to their liking.
Is this...
...holy food?
How should I know?
You'll find out soon enough - when you finish it.
No.
You find out - you're the expert.
- I don't want to eat it.
- Oh!
But why not?
What are companions for, if not to help one another?
Well?
Well?!
Can't be sure.
Little brother...
...if I thought for one moment that what you...
...told me was a lie---
Sister of the Faith?
Tell my ox-like friend, here...
...would you describe this food as being “holy"?
All food is holy - it comes from God.
I hope I have made the right decision, Ranulf.
My mind is sorely troubled.
Sister...
...the return of your Lady is
Hawk's first concern.
We could have offered what little wealth we have...
...and asked Voltan for sufficient time to...
...pay the rest. I'm sure we could make him understand.
The Dark One understands nothing but the spilling of blood.
I'm a warrior.
And I know that your salvation from Voltan...
...lies in having the strength of someone like Hawk to protect you.
My son - God protects us.
He was protecting the Abbess...
...and look where it's got her.
Ranulf...
...your words flirt with blasphemy!
My words are just as true, nevertheless.
It's impossible to talk to the woman sensibly.
She will find her own counsel.
Our first concern is the gold.
Tomorrow we arrange a welcome...
...for the slavers of the
River Shale.
Welcome!
Welcome, friends!
Welcome! Good to see you!
I have many fine slaves...
...for you to buy today.
All lovely and clean for yer!
Fine! Look at that lot there, eh?
Well?!
Well?!
Did I mislead you?
Aren't they a fine bunch?
Blood it cost me to collect these fine specimens!
They don't call Sped the finest...
...trader on the River Shale for nothing!
"Play square with me and I'll play square with you"...
...that's what I say.
But play foul with Sped...
...and may God help yer!
Not as good as last time, Thomas.
What?!
Indeed.
Whaddya say?!
Look at the fine biceps on this one, here. Look at that.
Hunchback...
...greetings.
I don't know what you're doing here...
...but you've chosen the wrong time to do it.
My apologies.
I have an urgent request to make.
Request?
I find myself in need of two thousand gold pieces...
...and have been told that that boat...
...contains sufficient for my cause.
I shall need your help to unload it.
This a jest?!
It's a good one!
It's no jest.
Will no-one rid me of this madman?
Cut him down!
Eh?!
Release them.
Now!
Man!
Take this and return to your homes.
What about fat man, here?
I'm sure you'll think of something.
Put me down, you over-stuffed fool!
It'll be a pleasure!
Damn you, eater of dung!
I'll make you pay double for this!
You still haven't learned the lesson of humility yet, have you, worm?
Get me my club and I'll crack your head...
...like the putrid egg it is!
Since you set such store by this...
...club of yours, you've given me an idea.
Let me loose!
Open wide!
Bite hard, my friend.
Now, prattle-tale...
...I advise you to stay silent.
One word from that foul mouth of yours and...
Or perhaps one of your bought slaves...
...might happen along and find you.
No doubt he'll want to exchange fond memories with you.
The sort that will make you laugh loudly.
Our thanks, brother, for the bountiful gifts...
...you have bestowed upon us.
Some people can never keep their mouths shut.
Let me raid the fat lords in the north.
I will send cold fear into their hearts.
All I ask...
...is you give me command of some men to prove my strength.
My blood is forever on the move!
It needs excitement!
If I were to press one more inch...
...your backbone would snap like rotten wood.
Is this not excitement?
Is not the fine choice between living and dying...
...more than enough to make your hot blood race through your veins?!
We will talk of this no more.
My face pains me.
Draw your dagger out one more inch, and you are a dead man...
...be you my son, or not.
I know the art of curing.
Shall I tend your face?
There is no cure for this face...
...Woman.
Only periods of relief.
What filthy animal have we here?
I beg you - have pity on me!
I barely escaped with my life.
You may not escape so easily from the hands of...
...Drogo, son of Voltan.
If you are who you say you are...
...we are brothers under the skin.
I buy slaves on the River Shale.
You dare to call me "brother"?
A slaver?
God's teeth! Listen to me.
I have words of great importance for you.
Your news had better be very good.
Would the news that a certain Hunchback...
...is no longer master of the river slavers be important?
Goon
And...
That a band of warriors led by a certain man had...
...taken possession of the
Hunchback's gold.
What man? Get to the point!
All right... but you're choking me!
He is a strange warrior who wields a mighty sword.
A warrior?
Hawk.
It must be.
Quickly, where is he?
Such information would be worth much...
...to the right person?
Well, it didn't make a lot of sense...
...but as I hid in the bushes I heard one of his men speak of a sanctuary.
So...
...he helps the Sisters find my father's ransom.
Now this must stay a secret...
...between you... and me.
Not only will I bring back the head of this Hawk...
...but I'll have the gold as well.
And then, Voltan...
...we'll see who is the
Lord of the Dance.
You have done well...
...and will be richly rewarded.
But first, you must swear you will tell no-one of this...
...chance remark you overheard.
Today is the day...
...that Drogo comes of age...
...my father.
Has the one we seek come?
Not yet.
Hurry! The pain grows worse!
Soon my tormentor will be in my grasp.
Then shall he endure...
...double the pain that I have suffered these long years!
Prepare yourself, Dark One.
It is truly a miracle.
Our Lady is saved.
Not yet.
And Hawk still believes that when the gold is given...
...the Dark One will kill her.
But he gave his word.
We must trust him.
To trust him is to trust the Devil himself.
We stay until the Abbess is safe.
It will anger Voltan if he finds you here.
You must go!
We stay.
Our Sister has great faith in Voltan's word.
One that she may live to regret.
Baldin!
Check to see if this place could be held against attack.
No way in, there.
A small door leading to the outside - barred.
It will hold against many men.
The rest is... as you see.
Always stuffing yourself...
...and never a thought of offering your companions anything.
Well...
...they're rather special, that's all.
Special, are they?
Too good to share with a friend, are they?
No... it's just that dwarves seem to be the only ones...
...who appreciate the special flavouring.
Are you insinuating that your people have better taste than mine?
Mmm.
What are they? Some kind of fruit?
"Fruit“, he says?
Well, what are they then?
Those are the finest sugared turkles money can buy.
"Turkles"?
Mmm, you long lummox. Turkles.
What is it you call them...?
Lizard's eyeballs.
You needn't worry.
Actually, they're sugared nuts, but if I'd told that to the big one...
...in no time at all this bag would have been as empty as his head.
Armed men - moving towards us.
- How many?
- A dozen.
Please - give them the gold?
They shall have it when the
Abbess is returned.
Now go to your cells.
That's far enough.
State your business.
You know my business.
I am Drogo, son of Voltan.
I come for the gold.
The gold will be given when the
Abbess is released.
Tell Voltan it's here.
Waiting.
I did not make myself clear.
I came for the gold.
I am no messenger!
But I will give you a message...
...the message of death!
Take him to Voltan.
Tell him Hawk awaits the return of the Abbess.
Why did you not give him the gold?!
That is all he wanted!
Now you will bring the death of the Dark One upon us!
He came for the gold AND Hawk.
If he'd got them...
...your Lady would not have lived beyond the dawn...
...and this place would have been burned to the ground.
You should have given him the gold!
He would have returned the Abbess and left us to live in peace.
The peace of the dead.
I wanted...
...to prove myself.
Hawk.
Hawk... where?
He helps the nuns.
The gold...
...is in the church.
I tried!
DROGO!!!
My son lies dead.
Yet you live.
Give them weapons.
It is fitting my son dies with...
...dogs at his feet!
Fight!
Or you die where you stand!
Have you lost your courage so soon?
Pick it up!
Pick it up!!!
Soon, Voltan will be here.
The gold is here...
...and I am here.
One man.
On a horse.
This is Voltan.
Wait!
I have words for you.
I will go.
I know you hide the one called Hawk...
...behind your doors. Hear me!
And hear me well.
Tomorrow...
...when the moon is high,
I shall return.
Hawk...
...and the gold will be given to me, or...
...you shall have your Lady back...
...with her innards tied around her scrawny neck!
And this place shall be wiped...
...from the face of
THE LAND!!!
We will all die because you killed his son.
There would have been no ransom gold were it not for Hawk.
You should have paid!
And now we must all suffer because of your quarrel with this man.
I shall ride for help.
There's... no time...
...my beloved.
Voltan...
...goes to destroy your father.
You must go.
Eliane---
Don't think badly of Sister Monica.
She's frightened and confused.
She blames you for our coming here.
I know.
What now?
We are few and Voltan has too many men.
If you're being stung by wasps...
...you can either cover your head...
...or you can search our their nest...
...and destroy it.
Then let us find ourselves a nest...
...and bring the odds in our favour.
Crow.
Find the woman - I need her help.
Woman - we need the use of your magic.
There is no sign of the Abbess.
I am ready.
Take one more step and her throat will be slit.
The smoke is thinning - we must go.
We've done enough!
Move out - the smoke's thinning!
Let's move out!
They will be here soon enough.
Let us rest.
This is where the final struggle will be.
Why have you come?
I have a plan that will gain you the ransom...
...and Hawk.
I only ask... that you spare the
Abbess and the church.
Sister! I forbid you to speak further!
I must.
Your life and the church are all that matter.
The end cannot justify the means!
Then tomorrow will be the judge of my actions.
Enough.
Baldin.
Make sure all the doors are barred.
Ah, little Sister.
Some welcome food before
I retire - perfect.
We have sat waiting, like this...
...many times before.
Sometimes I tire...
...of the fighting and killing.
At night...
...I can hear the call of my race.
They wait for me.
Once I join them, we will be forgotten.
Your people will never be forgotten.
All is secure.
It would take a thousand men to enter here, now.
Good.
To warm you against the night air.
Thank you.
Mmm! Beer!
And a fine brew, by the smell of it.
Thank you, Sister.
You and your ladies have been most generous.
Excellent.
Great warrior you may be...
...but against so many swords at your throat...
...I fear the fight would be short.
A little help from the good Sister.
Tie them up.
You said no blood would be spilt inside the church!
I kept my side of the bargain!
Unfortunately...
...you will not live long enough to realise your mistake!
First you took the woman
I loved...
...then you slew my son.
Your death will be slow and painful.
As will be your friends'.
You will know how I have suffered through the years with a face...
...that no woman would look upon!
Forcing me to take another man's child to call my own!
You say you loved Eliane...?
And yet you killed her.
- You killed our father!
- Enough!
Where is the gold?
Where you will never find it.
Dear brother...
I think you and your friends...
...can be persuaded to tell me.
They don't know.
Only I can tell you where it is.
Well, then...
...they shall watch you suffer!
And when I have finished...
...they will accompany you down the river of death.
Fetch me fire!!!
Bring all the wine and food in your stores...
...counter of beads. I have... thirsty work ahead.
Little men with pointed ears.
I shall trim them for you later.
And the giant.
Felled by a pinch of powder!
You will give us great sport before you die!
I shall give you a crushed head if
I can get my hands free.
You and I have met before - that time I let you live.
You used your “second life“ well...
...fetching my saintly brother.
Now...
...I have no more use for you.
And the dwarf.
You should never have been allowed...
...to dig yourself out of the earth!
Bring the Abbess!
I think it fitting that such a holy woman be...
...present to give them Absolution...
...before they die.
See how it glows, brother?
Soon you will feel its touch.
And together...
...we shall seek out the hiding place of the gold.
Leave him, skull-face!
I can tell you where the gold is hidden.
Speak then, misshapened one!
It is buried beneath me.
Where?!
VOLT AN!
You will die by my hand!
Guard them!
He's still alive.
Only just.
We MUST free ourselves.
Quick - the crystal.
The pain is great.
Has HE been found?
Yes. Yes - he dies this very night. Quickly!
THE PAIN!!!
My bonds are as immovable as yours.
If we are not free by the time
Voltan returns, we---
You have need of my help, Lord.
You've been looking into your fire of magic, Mother.
Go quickly.
Voltan's men return with the Abbess...
...and the Dark One will not be at his ministerings long.
This will make them dream a little longer.
Even my powers cannot save him.
He waits at the Gate of Death.
I am sorry...
...not to be with you for the final fight.
I die as I wanted...
...among my friends.
This will protect the grave...
...from wild beasts who would disturb it.
The dwarf shall sleep peacefully.
What now, Hawk?
I go to avenge my friend's death...
...and pay a debt long overdue.
How do we get back into the church?
I will give you the way.
I beseech you once more...
...release my Sisters!
If Hawk is not in my hands by dawn, they will die.
And I will tear this sanctuary down - stone by stone.
Pray hard, woman - that he may hear you.
Have no fear...
...my magic powers will not harm you.
But, just for a short time...
...my powders will create a whirlpool of flying...
...firebolts to blind their eyes.
Take her away - I may yet need her!
Hawk! The Abbess - they're taking her!
Giant! Behind you - beware!
Lady?
Sweet little Lady.
Wait here.
Now, Hawk...
...this is the moment of my revenge.
At my command they shall all be hung.
And your friend will have his heart skewered.
What do you want?
You.
Always you.
Let the Sisters and
Gort go free.
I shall be your prisoner.
You... still don't UNDERSTAND!!!
YOU ARE IN NO POSITION
TO BARGAIN!
THROW DOWN YOUR SWORD!!!
Now.
And your vestment.
No!
If you have a god to pray to...
...pray to him now.
Enough! You have prayed enough!
GORT!
So...
...you have found the power which is...
...rightly mine.
Ten thousand times have I dreamed of killing you - slowly...
...painfully.
And now---
Ha!
Brother...
...I shall... wait for you... at the Gates of Hell!
Your friend will soon recover his strength...
...but I grieve for the others who died.
I know you will see that they rest well.
There's a lot of good eating and drinking money here, my friend.
I don't suppose we could-—-
We have further need of you, Dark One.
Your sleep of death...
...will not last long.
My heart is heavy at the loss of your friends.
It is a high price to pay.
The price is always high.
Use it well.
Where will you go now...
...Lord Hawk?
Gort follows his own path.
As do I.
I've heard talk of fat barons...
...with great stores of winter food and wine to protect.
It seems that... I am the man for that work.
Then may God go with you.
The Dark One is no more.
But, even as we speak...
...the wizards gather in the south.
Follow your destiny!
When you get that look in your face-—-
You did say "south“, woman?
Ah, well.
Who wants to work with fat old barons, anyway?
South it is.
We shall meet again...
...bearer of the Mind Sword.

{12258}{12334}Is it a coin shining there?
{12355}{12424}It is. It's a coin.
{12422}{12471}l'll get it for you,|Father.
{12491}{12558}It will be for the poor.
{12817}{12865}Father?
{12933}{12985}Father?
{14341}{14379}Time to get up,Jacques.
{15944}{15997}Shit.
{16196}{16236}Enzo!
{16290}{16325}Jacques!
{16619}{16748}- You shouldn't dive every day, Papa.|- Then you shouldn't eat every day.
{16890}{16952}Don't worry.|When I am tired...
{16951}{17032}the mermaids help me out.
{18296}{18374}Hey, have you ever|seen a mermaid?
{18402}{18443}No.
{18442}{18552}l've seen them.|Don't you want to know where?
{18789}{18864}- Why don't you ask me?|- What?
{18863}{18915}Where I saw mermaids.
{18915}{18964}Why don't you|ever ask any questions?
{18963}{19012}l'm always the one|asking the question.
{19011}{19080}Here we are like two stones.|Now l'm talking to myself.
{19079}{19164}Ask me something, goddamn it!
{19162}{19223}Why did my mother leave?
{19243}{19272}Pump.
{19454}{19521}Your mother didn't leave.
{19520}{19582}She went back to America,|that's all.
{19582}{19620}It's her home.
{19620}{19694}Women are like that--
{19692}{19727}unpredictable...
{19751}{19787}like the sea.
{19861}{19906}A leak! No!
{19906}{19963}Help!Jacques!
{19961}{20026}No, the water!|Water!
{20026}{20075}Help!|I can't breathe!
{20073}{20126}No!
{20297}{20355}Daddy! Daddy!
{20736}{20812}What?|Stay here,Jacques!
{23796}{23827}Mr. Molinari?
{23872}{23939}Yes.|How did it happen?
{23938}{24056}Well, the company asked me to extract|everything I could from the wreck.
{24053}{24138}So the divers were trying|to get at the engine...
{24136}{24213}and the boat just|turned over in the current!
{24274}{24337}Look, I fucked up!
{24336}{24377}Look!
{24405}{24441}Can you help?
{24441}{24517}- How many are down there?|- There's just one.
{24516}{24610}We're feeding him lots of air,|but he's not breathing properly.
{24636}{24694}Hey, you gotta get him|out of there fast!
{24790}{24821}Ten thousand.
{24916}{24980}- Lira?|- Dollars.
{25055}{25107}Hey, wait a minute.
{25107}{25176}You guys aren't gonna try|to hold me up at a time like this.
{25323}{25371}Okay, you tell me.
{25371}{25427}How much would you say|a man's life is worth?
{25470}{25527}In my village, we have a saying.
{25571}{25623}How does it go again?
{25673}{25764}- I don't remember.|- What's that supposed to mean?
{25762}{25794}Forget it.
{26385}{26452}Force, eh?
{27107}{27183}Since we have a little time,|you write that check?
{28384}{28520}- How much longer can he do that?|- My brother is a world champion.
{28536}{28564}Sign.
{30637}{30691}Bravo! Bravo!
{30807}{30870}Thanks! Bravo!
{31179}{31259}Hey! Wait!|Wait a minute!
{31258}{31345}Wait a minute!|Wait, you guys! Hey!
{31343}{31428}Hey, thanks, you guys.
{31426}{31476}Really. I mean it.
{31475}{31517}You're welcome.
{32602}{32687}Enzo, what you gonna do|with the money?
{32715}{32775}Have the car painted.
{32775}{32853}But Giuseppe|will do that for $25.
{32908}{32967}Then tell him|to wax it too.
{33476}{33513}Enzo, really,|what you gonna get?
{33530}{33632}A rosary for Mamma.|A dress for Angelica.
{33665}{33727}Get yourself|a suit that fits.
{33858}{33903}But most important--
{33951}{33979}Yes?
{34047}{34106}Find me the Frenchman.
{34175}{34228}Find me Jacques Mayol.
{36473}{36501}Bye.
{37026}{37062}Are you Dr. Laurence?
{37084}{37187}No, l'm the assistant.|Welcome to Peru.
{37217}{37258}Thank you.
{37916}{37951}Here.
{38534}{38631}- A drink to warm up?|- Yes, please.
{38629}{38693}- Tea or whiskey?|- Both.
{38692}{38779}Did I just see a man|in a red suit and goggles?
{38802}{38838}Right.
{38921}{39012}- The insurance person is here.|- It's about time.
{39067}{39163}-Johana Baker.|- Nice trip, huh?
{39226}{39282}Thank you.
{39282}{39351}It's three weeks since the accident.|We're getting a little anxious.
{39350}{39403}Frank, you better get out there.|He's about ready to go in.
{39403}{39439}Right.
{39542}{39591}First dive, two minutes.
{40066}{40106}Who--
{40107}{40200}- Who is that?|- Mayol.
{40197}{40233}Jacques Mayol.
{40270}{40369}Those are your experiments?|Dumping a guy in a frozen lake?
{40367}{40431}The truck fell into|a very deep crevasse.
{40430}{40482}We weren't able|to rescue the equipment.
{40532}{40593}l'll have to talk|to the driver.
{40592}{40650}In the spring,|when he melts.
{40771}{40850}You really send him|under the ice?
{40848}{40909}He isn't a slave or a convict|or anything, is he?
{40908}{40990}My dear, science|is a cruel mistress.
{41221}{41284}- How is he gonna breathe?|- He isn't.
{41560}{41614}Listen.
{41613}{41686}That's the sound|of his heart.
{41685}{41761}Can you hear the speed|at which it's slowing down?
{41784}{41828}That's incredible.
{42266}{42339}He's in the fluoroscope now.
{42393}{42464}Listen to his heartbeat.
{42463}{42532}I can't believe that.
{42531}{42579}All the blood is concentrated|in his brain.
{42579}{42636}It doesn't even feed|his limbs anymore.
{42635}{42753}That's a phenomenon that's only been|observed in whales and dolphins...
{42751}{42787}until now.
{43276}{43313}Why is he doing this?
{43363}{43405}I don't know.
{44878}{44945}Shouldn't someone take him|a blanket or something?
{45398}{45439}Coffee?
{45684}{45778}- I know you.|- We just met a few minutes ago.
{45816}{45852}In the lake.
{45889}{45925}No, in the hut.
{46245}{46300}Then it must have been someone|who looked a lot like you.
{46415}{46443}Thanks.
{47606}{47641}There's not a lot of time.
{48041}{48090}It's a present.
{48160}{48195}Thank you.
{48257}{48293}You're not gonna open it?
{48723}{48812}- You here for a long time?|- No.
{48856}{48934}- Where do you live?|- New York.
{49196}{49248}Well, it's been nice|meeting you.
{49348}{49422}It's nice meeting you too.
{50428}{50492}l'll only be five minutes.
{51244}{51280}Clown.
{51337}{51402}It's a llama.
{51660}{51692}Darjeeling.
{52100}{52156}I missed you rascals.
{53734}{53791}Jacques, my friend.
{53820}{53869}How are you?
{53895}{53923}Enzo?
{53924}{54014}I leave you swimming, and 20 years later|you're still in the water.
{54012}{54092}What the hell are you doing,|training?
{54115}{54143}Yeah.
{54183}{54219}Good.
{54318}{54400}Check out the suit.|Looking good, no?
{54441}{54517}- You know I am the world champion?|- Yeah, I know.
{54550}{54640}The world championship starts|in ten days in Taormina.
{54679}{54715}Be my guest.
{54747}{54805}Your ticket.
{54803}{54831}Why?
{54880}{54928}Because l'm sure|you're dying to beat me.
{55028}{55098}You're the best, Enzo.
{55163}{55199}See you there.
{55572}{55624}Come on, let's go, let's go!
{55622}{55741}Go park in Jersey, you asshole!|Come on, come on, come on!
{55738}{55811}I gotta get movin'!|I gotta make a livin' here!
{55965}{56031}Oh, God. Shit.
{56030}{56102}I changed the lock,|you son of a bitch!
{56100}{56169}Sally! It's me.
{56227}{56294}- Where have you been?|- Peru.
{56333}{56369}We were burgled.
{56369}{56450}They got the television set.|They got the new stereo.
{56448}{56517}They got the ring|my grandma gave me.
{56516}{56572}I hate New York.
{56655}{56697}I hate this apartment.
{56770}{56849}- I hate you.|- How was your trip?
{57011}{57063}It was nice. It was--
{57092}{57189}It was interesting.
{57296}{57341}It was cold.
{57496}{57532}You got a picture of him?
{57714}{57750}Matter of fact--
{57962}{57998}What the fuck is that?
{58075}{58132}It's his heartbeat.
{58188}{58242}l'm gonna make some coffee.
{58241}{58292}They left the stove.
{58598}{58663}He had the most beautiful eyes.
{58696}{58728}It's funny.
{58808}{58850}It was like a fairy tale.
{58908}{58966}You know the French.|They're very romantic people.
{58965}{59036}He's not French.|He's American.
{59035}{59133}His mother's American. Haven't you|been listening to anything I said?
{59130}{59192}Yeah. l've been|listening all night.
{59192}{59263}It sounds like|you're in love.
{59261}{59324}But everybody knows there's|no such thing as love at first sight.
{59368}{59420}You ate all the ice cream.
{59939}{59983}This is good.|This is very good.
{59983}{60067}Very, very good.|Very good.
{60065}{60114}Unfortunately,|it's incomplete.
{60152}{60189}-Johana.|- What?
{60190}{60309}- Am I boring you?|- No, of course not.
{60306}{60377}Definitely not.|What did you say?
{60376}{60451}I said that this file|is incomplete, okay?
{60450}{60536}Why don't you go back to Laurence|and get the registration?
{60534}{60587}Okay? Don't let him tell you|it's in the glove compartment.
{60613}{60682}- That guy was really frozen?|- Like a Popsicle.
{60681}{60726}They're keeping him|on a stick till spring.
{60773}{60809}Glad I didn't go.
{60934}{60978}I can't hear you!
{60977}{61063}I said the snowmobile papers|are in the glove compartment.
{61062}{61138}Yes. Listen, just get the customs office|to send me a copy as fast as possible.
{61136}{61215}We can't get you new equipment|until our file's complete.
{61213}{61288}All right. You'll have them|by the end of the week.
{61286}{61391}Great. You've made me a very happy|insurance person. Thank you.
{61389}{61466}- All right. Good-bye.|- "Dr. Laurence?"
{61464}{61518}- Yes?|- You don't happen to know...
{61517}{61635}how I can get in touch with that|diver of yours,Jacques Mayol?
{61668}{61726}The last I heard,|he was in Taormina...
{61724}{61826}at the World Diving Championships|in Sicily.
{61824}{61860}Sicily?
{61919}{61992}Duffy?|We've got big problems in Sicily.
{61990}{62041}- What do you mean?|- Oh, God, the Mafia.
{62041}{62146}The Mafia. The Cosa Nostra. De Niro,|Coppola, Pacino. I mean, I knew it.
{62143}{62207}- We shouldn't have written that policy.|- What happened?
{62206}{62250}- The documents are forged.|- No.
{62251}{62299}Yes.|The notary is a phony.
{62299}{62356}He's got the same signature|as the contractor.
{62355}{62414}- That can't be true!|- Well, it is.
{62414}{62466}We gotta send|someone there immediately.
{62465}{62525}If we prove the forgery,|maybe we're off the hook.
{62525}{62577}There's a plane|in four hours to Rome...
{62577}{62634}and from there|it's a short trip to Sicily.
{62633}{62681}l'm gonna call Cordoza.|He's gonna get us out of this.
{62680}{62758}No, I called him. His son is|being bar mitzvahed tomorrow.
{62757}{62835}- Oh, damn his son!|- l'll go.
{62834}{62923}- You'd do that?|- Yeah, l'll go.
{62921}{62980}Thank you. I thought|it was Spanish you spoke.
{63032}{63085}Italian is practically|the same thing.
{63543}{63592}Thanks a lot.
{64047}{64101}Mayol, Mayol, Mayol.|No reservation.
{64257}{64321}- Are you sure?|- Positive, sir.
{64349}{64485}- This is the Hotel San Domenico?|- It has been so for 127 years.
{64729}{64837}Be careful with that car.|It's a new paint job, okay? Contessa.
{64965}{65063}Giacomino, my friend,|my brother!
{65093}{65213}So you finally decided to join us.|You did the right thing.
{65252}{65333}You remember my little brother,|Roberto?
{65332}{65396}- Hi.|- Hi, Roberto.
{65395}{65472}- What room have you got?|- I haven't got one.
{65471}{65533}You don't have a room?|Paolo?
{65532}{65580}What did I just hear?
{65580}{65638}I personally call you to reserve|a room for my good friend...
{65637}{65690}and you treat him|like a stranger.
{65689}{65743}- It's okay. l'll go somewhere else.|- Not only is Jacques Mayol...
{65742}{65791}a very special friend...
{65791}{65861}but he happens to be one of|the best divers in the world!
{65860}{65954}And you throw him out!|Are you crazy or what?
{65993}{66056}Drop it, Enzo.|l'll find something.
{66148}{66228}Take mine.|l'll take the countess's suite.
{66226}{66295}She told me she was leaving|for the cemetery.
{66319}{66377}She'll be more|comfortable there.
{66509}{66552}l'm glad you're here.
{66770}{66894}So after all these years, you must|have lots of questions to ask me.
{66891}{66980}- Am I right?|- Yeah, sure. Lots of questions.
{67103}{67138}Well, what are they?
{67289}{67365}I don't know how|to ask the questions.
{67423}{67490}- You married?|- No, no, no.
{67601}{67654}Me neither,|because of my mother.
{67652}{67702}She's a curse, my mother.|Tornado.
{67702}{67756}Stubborn as a mule.
{67780}{67828}I was engaged for a week.
{67828}{67911}After that, Mamma was so mad,|the pasta was bouncing off the walls.
{67989}{68048}So not married.
{68047}{68106}Good for you.
{68106}{68176}You play the field like me.|A girl in every port, huh?
{68174}{68245}- After all, we're men.|- Damn right!
{68244}{68329}That's what I tell them when|people say you've turned into a fish.
{68327}{68363}People say that?
{68444}{68509}Forget it.|I was joking!
{69277}{69353}l'll bet you my watch|that she's in my bed tonight.
{69438}{69474}Hello.
{69518}{69566}- Hey, you know each other?|- Yes.
{69566}{69614}Enzo Molinari.|This is a great pleasure.
{69614}{69713}Johana Baker. Nice to meet you.|This is a coincidence.
{69711}{69767}It's unbelievable.|All the way out here.
{69766}{69856}It's incredible.|I can't believe it.
{69948}{70023}Uh, would you like|to sit down?
{70022}{70071}Yes, thank you.
{70147}{70258}- l'm not interrupting anything, am I?|- No, not at all. Emilio.
{70254}{70332}- You staying at the hotel?|- No, they're all full.
{70330}{70430}But they recommended a pension in town.|They say all of Taormina's full.
{70428}{70507}It's the Free Diving World Championship.|I am, by the way, world champion.
{70505}{70613}- What are you doing in Sicily?|- An insurance investigation.
{70610}{70702}I decided to take a few days off,|see the island.
{70700}{70801}There is no place in the world|more beautiful than Sicily.
{70798}{70853}A spaghetti del mare|for the super dedicated...
{70852}{70914}- traveling insurance agent.|- Oh, no, thank you.
{70914}{71003}-Just a coffee.|- No, you should try it. It's good.
{71001}{71070}- Okay.|- As I was telling you earlier...
{71068}{71117}I am the world champion|free diver.
{71116}{71199}Some people say it's the most|virile sport in the world.
{71198}{71296}One has to admit when you see|those men diving head first...
{71293}{71413}in that deep blue sea, all muscles|contracted in one super human effort--
{71410}{71455}- What?|- Mamma.
{71588}{71658}She'll kill me if she catches me|eating pasta in a restaurant.
{71710}{71765}- Bullshit.|- Eat.
{71788}{71826}Mamma!
{72040}{72133}Mamma, Roberto and an elevator--|Isn't that enough?
{72196}{72279}Coffee only. l'm diving tomorrow.|You remember little Jacques?
{72277}{72394}Jacques Mayol.|His friend,Johana.
{72391}{72439}She is beautiful, no?
{72536}{72588}Spaghetti del mare.
{72768}{72816}Thank you very much.
{72889}{72936}l'm so hungry.
{73026}{73054}Good.
{73690}{73752}This is it.
{73750}{73811}It's great.
{73931}{73984}So you're going to be|really busy these days, huh?
{74003}{74068}I don't know.
{74068}{74096}Why?
{74138}{74180}Because l--
{74179}{74232}I don't know.|I just thought--
{74272}{74348}You're-- The competition.|Interviews.
{74347}{74433}A competition like this requires|a great deal of concentration.
{74430}{74484}Doesn't it?
{74541}{74591}Yeah.
{74634}{74682}You can put down the bags now.
{74828}{74856}Thanks.
{74933}{75001}We have to get ready|for the ceremony tonight.
{74999}{75041}The Tahitian|is the new world champion.
{75041}{75118}l'm tired.|I don't feel like it.
{75117}{75170}Roberto, the jacket.
{75206}{75254}- This one?|- Yes.
{75388}{75424}Very good.
{75537}{75589}What about the shoes?
{75646}{75694}Very chic.
{75694}{75764}- You don't have anything else, do you?|- No.
{75763}{75834}Then it's very chic.
{76069}{76140}- Hi.|- Hi.
{76189}{76257}{y:i}Ladies and gentlemen,|{y:i}your attention, please.
{76256}{76292}Mr. Andre Bonnet...
{76292}{76377}President of the International|Diving Championship Committee...
{76422}{76507}{y:i}is going to present this trophy to|{y:i}the new world champion of free diving.
{76504}{76589}This afternoon|our new champion descended...
{76587}{76692}to the remarkable depth|of 310 feet.
{76767}{76815}A one-day hero.
{76847}{76890}{y:i}Mr. President,|"if you please"--
{76987}{77051}A new world record.|That's great.
{77049}{77121}It gives me something|to beat tomorrow.
{77120}{77182}- You ever been to Tahiti?|- No.
{77181}{77265}l'll take you there. We'll live|in the sun. You'll cook fresh fish.
{77264}{77346}We'll make love|under the coconut trees.
{77343}{77392}How about you do the cooking?
{77410}{77485}- And you forgot the hula.|- Excuse me.
{77710}{77807}He looks strange, doesn't he?|Like a baby who just learned to walk.
{77842}{77894}- Have you known him long?|- Forever.
{77894}{78000}We used to live on the same island|in Greece when we were kids.
{78058}{78108}What was he like|when he was little?
{78108}{78185}Little, very little.
{78182}{78231}That is,|compared to me.
{78231}{78285}I get it, Enzo.|You were a superior child.
{78285}{78346}Exactly.
{78345}{78485}What is it,Johana? You're so crazy|about him, you don't see the truth.
{78482}{78536}Don't think of Jacques|as a human being.
{78534}{78583}He's from another world.
{78642}{78695}And just what world|are you from, Enzo?
{78825}{78873}Okay.
{79007}{79147}And now, my friends, you are invited|for a drink around the swimming pool.
{79876}{79972}Today at lunch you asked me|if I had any questions.
{79970}{80068}Ah! You finally want|to know about women.
{80116}{80162}Are they|what's most important?
{80162}{80211}No.
{80210}{80268}It depends.
{80266}{80315}Sometime they are.
{80360}{80408}What exactly|do you want to know?
{80430}{80461}Everything.
{80507}{80568}Everything about what?
{80640}{80672}About everything.
{81123}{81249}So between Mamma, Roberto, and Alfredo,|we yell and scream all day long.
{81245}{81300}Except with Angelica.|She just cries.
{81300}{81418}And then, finally,|we all end up kissing.
{81415}{81474}Can you explain that to me?
{81497}{81526}Huh?
{81559}{81619}Because that's|what love is all about.
{81618}{81697}It's a pain in the ass...
{81696}{81748}but it keeps us together.
{81784}{81820}A large...
{81863}{81913}and beautiful...
{82003}{82039}family.
{82258}{82315}- Enzo.|- Yeah?
{82350}{82424}We gotta quit|this competition.
{82423}{82459}Why?
{82459}{82579}Because if we don't|l'm gonna beat you.
{82760}{82797}Do you hear that?
{82923}{82951}What?
{82952}{83024}He looks me in the eye|like some fucking goldfish...
{83023}{83117}and says,|"l'm gonna beat you."
{83279}{83346}Oh, my God.
{83399}{83460}Hmm. That's what|you guys are here for.
{83485}{83556}Listen to her.|That's what he's here for.
{83594}{83691}He's here to lose.|That's what he's here for.
{83689}{83741}First of all, I am unbeatable.
{83788}{83818}Second--
{83819}{83901}- How old are you?|- Two years younger than you.
{83899}{84011}As I said, second of all,|you're too skinny.
{84008}{84064}You've got tiny lungs.
{84064}{84156}I still don't understand how you|can dive without getting sick.
{84154}{84219}The size of the lungs|has nothing to do with it.
{84218}{84287}"The size of the lungs|has nothing to do with it."
{84286}{84356}How long can you|hold your breath?
{84415}{84450}Longer than you.
{84495}{84551}We'll see.
{86777}{86849}Hey! Take it easy!|Jesus!
{86885}{86920}Thanks.
{86920}{86968}What are you, nuts?
{87263}{87332}- Let me help you with this.|- Who won?
{87331}{87427}Won what? The asshole award?|It was a tie.
{87425}{87501}Acting like a pair|of two-year-olds.
{87500}{87548}You could have died|in that pool.
{87731}{87783}Stop moving.|You're rocking the boat.
{87782}{87847}Luckily, I was there to save you.
{87953}{87990}My wallet.
{88055}{88102}It's here.
{88101}{88176}No, no, no.|I want to show you. Give it to me.
{88259}{88287}Sit down.
{88746}{88795}That's my family.
{89152}{89219}What kind of man...
{89218}{89266}has such a family?
{89665}{89706}It's okay.
{89829}{89877}It's all right.
{91261}{91309}All the medics|are looking for you, Enzo.
{91309}{91367}I am meditating.|Can't you see?
{91366}{91451}Jacques does two hours of yoga|before going down!
{91449}{91517}I can have a five-minute nap!
{91866}{91918}Mr. Molinari...
{91917}{92003}l'm sorry, but you cannot dive|in this state of exhaustion.
{92124}{92178}What do you know about this?|Nothing.
{92177}{92253}So you just take your tubes|and your tin cans away.
{92268}{92331}The sea is mine.
{92331}{92419}I know when she is ready for me|and when she isn't.
{92417}{92498}And today she's ready.
{92497}{92538}You dive at your own risk.
{92597}{92626}Bravo.
{93300}{93356}One minute.
{93708}{93827}Three, two, one.
{95053}{95114}Your pants are too big for me.
{95262}{95310}Where are they?
{95473}{95511}Thank you.
{95512}{95571}Where is everybody?
{95570}{95601}They're gone.
{95629}{95690}Something's wrong.
{95972}{96043}You can't do that.
{96042}{96076}What's the matter?
{96076}{96178}I don't understand.|We've tried for two days.
{96176}{96237}They won't eat.|They won't perform.
{96236}{96288}It's since we got the new one.
{96418}{96466}It's finished for today.
{96466}{96515}She's the new one.
{96566}{96615}How can you tell it's a female?
{96654}{96703}The way she moves.
{97410}{97437}Help!
{97530}{97579}Jacques, help me.
{97971}{98034}Help me up.|Help me--
{99087}{99162}Don't be sad.|I only took back what was mine.
{99161}{99226}Here. A present.
{99226}{99282}Tonight we're having|a little party among ourselves.
{99281}{99326}8:00 in my suite.
{99381}{99479}Mr. Roberto,|tell your brother to be reasonable.
{99477}{99526}Everybody's waiting|for him upstairs.
{99526}{99598}He can't.|He's indisposed.
{99597}{99723}- Shall we call a doctor?|- She's trying something.
{99787}{99845}Oh, Mr. Mayol, help us.
{99845}{99920}He refuses to receive his medal,|and everybody's waiting for him.
{100010}{100072}- l'll do my best.|- That's very kind of you.
{100113}{100182}- It's Jacques.|-Jacques!
{100181}{100240}My friend, come on in.
{100239}{100308}Mr. Molinari, allow me|to impress upon you...
{100307}{100448}the importance of your attending|the award ceremony for the press.
{100444}{100503}I think my brother told you|I was indisposed.
{100503}{100589}That should do it, no?|I am allowed to be indisposed.
{100587}{100727}Right? So you just go tell the press|that the big Enzo Molinari...
{100723}{100844}overwhelmed by his inspiring descent|of 324 feet...
{100841}{100954}will not be able to receive|his trinket because he is--
{100952}{101008}- Hmm?|- He is--
{101007}{101093}- Indisposed.|- "Brava."
{101167}{101248}-Jacques, my friend!|- Why don't you go pick up your medal?
{101247}{101338}Because pasta|should be eaten al dente!
{101766}{101828}Let me know how you find it.
{102027}{102080}Yes, l'm still here.|I can hardly hear you.
{102079}{102179}Almost everything is almost--|Yeah. Two, maybe three days.
{102209}{102258}But, um--
{102258}{102320}No, l'm in a restaurant.|What?
{102319}{102396}Okay, l'll call you back.|I promise. Tomorrow.
{102395}{102467}Okay. Okay.
{102465}{102505}Yes!
{102535}{102636}My office in New York.|It's really busy back there.
{102634}{102682}I have so much work to do.
{102713}{102761}- Is it good?|- You want some?
{102761}{102819}Ah, no, l'm--
{102956}{102996}Thank you.
{103360}{103400}What's the matter?
{103440}{103493}I have to ask you a favor.
{103724}{103782}We're not stealing a dolphin, huh?
{103781}{103837}No, I told you,|we're just helping one out.
{103892}{103932}Trying to help one out.
{103932}{103966}Yes.
{104004}{104060}Good.
{104570}{104632}Yeah. Stairs!
{105747}{105838}You can stop that now.|She has all the water she needs.
{105966}{106043}All right, we did it.|Let's go back to the party.
{106536}{106591}Five minutes.|That's all, okay?
{106941}{107008}Well, then, good night.
{107007}{107055}Good night.
{107055}{107112}- Good night,Jacques.|- Good night.
{107280}{107344}You don't need a stretcher|to take her with you.
{107343}{107409}- You know that?|- What?
{107431}{107522}The dolphins aren't the only ones|who don't feel very good sometimes.
{107571}{107688}Jacques, can I|come watch you dive tomorrow?
{107814}{107850}Yeah.
{107888}{107931}Good.
{108036}{108130}You really do have|a few things to learn about women.
{108921}{108970}What do those guys do?
{108970}{109025}They are paramedics.
{109025}{109074}They wait at 200 feet.
{109522}{109562}And him?
{109562}{109644}That is the diver|who goes below 300 feet.
{109642}{109714}He dives with|a helium oxygen mixture.
{109713}{109771}Compressed air is too dangerous.
{111404}{111441}Three minutes.
{120935}{120964}It's fantastic!
{120965}{121049}Three hundred and sixty feet, yes.
{121099}{121170}Congratulations,Jacques.|It's wonderful, wonderful.
{121169}{121208}l'm happy for you.
{121208}{121298}Here. Here.
{121297}{121399}- What is it?|- A little present. Nothing much.
{121396}{121465}I knew it.|I just knew it.
{121588}{121655}- You still collect them?|- Mm-hmm.
{121654}{121740}You don't have that one, do you?
{121739}{121849}No. It's beautiful.|Thank you.
{121864}{121930}It's nothing.|I knew it.
{121929}{122039}I told Roberto, " He's very good,|that little Frenchman. Very good."
{122037}{122073}Is this a poem?
{122073}{122161}No, it's a recipe for spaghetti|"frutti del mare."
{122160}{122196}Thank you.
{122247}{122308}You see I was right|in getting you out here.
{122307}{122356}You are world champion,|my friend.
{122645}{122715}It's a measuring tape.
{122763}{122820}You see?|This is your record...
{122819}{122868}three feet more than mine.
{122927}{123030}Looking at it from here,|it doesn't look like much, does it?
{123079}{123160}Keep your little measuring tape,|my friend.
{123158}{123264}It will be a nice souvenir|when I beat you next.
{130594}{130636}God.
{130820}{130869}Did you have a nice night?
{130869}{130902}Yeah.
{130994}{131042}I was with the dolphin.
{131092}{131173}- All night?|- Yeah.
{131203}{131269}- With a dolphin?|- Yeah.
{131421}{131469}I got to get back to New York.
{131616}{131729}I have my job, I have my work.|I have a life.
{132105}{132153}Will you take me|to the train station?
{133270}{133336}If you're ever in New York,|give me a call, okay?
{133830}{133864}Can I come in?
{133864}{133937}No problem.|I enjoy talking in my sleep.
{134117}{134188}Wake me up at 11:00.
{134794}{134832}Why are you always talking?
{134831}{134878}You think people are interested|in what you're talking about?
{134878}{134919}l'm not interested|and other people aren't either...
{134919}{134973}so just stop talking because|other people have things to say.
{134973}{135022}You understand me?
{135022}{135084}Stop talking.|It's bullshit!
{135082}{135168}- She's gone?|- Yes, she's gone!
{135210}{135268}Hey, l'm gonna take care of you.
{135266}{135351}l've got a job on an oil rig.|No sweat.
{135350}{135409}l'm taking you along.|Okay?
{135408}{135483}Come on.|Get your bags packed.
{135482}{135543}You're coming with me.
{135542}{135604}You stupid bastard.
{135697}{135764}We'll make a great team,|the two of us.
{135762}{135841}You'll see.|Okay?
{137812}{137858}{y:i}One hundred feet.
{138029}{138092}You're still thinking about her.
{138091}{138139}Don't think about her anymore.
{138139}{138204}There are so many women|in the world.
{138204}{138292}Plenty of women everywhere, right?
{138290}{138342}Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
{138342}{138390}It isn't lit yet.
{138422}{138476}You shouldn't even|carry cigarettes on board.
{138525}{138596}Listen, we're not supposed|to piss either...
{138594}{138667}but that doesn't stop you|from carrying it on board.
{138691}{138727}The rules are the rules.
{138778}{138865}- What's your name again?|- Noireuter.
{138863}{138914}And where did you say|you were from?
{138978}{139008}Brussels.
{139131}{139179}Two hundred.
{139483}{139542}I was 17.
{139541}{139635}I loved her so much,|I tried to die for her.
{139633}{139749}Two years later,|I couldn't even remember her name.
{139747}{139787}Let me tell you...
{139787}{139877}time erases everything.
{139875}{139923}I don't want to erase anything.
{140164}{140237}{y:i}Four hundred fifty feet;|{y:i}end of descent.
{140319}{140367}You have enough air|for 15 minutes.
{140388}{140429}What's with the voice?
{140429}{140550}It's nothing.|Maybe the helium is up too high.
{140547}{140586}Does the voice come back?
{140618}{140705}For others, yes.|For you, who knows?
{140788}{140830}Try speaking to me.
{140846}{140890}I don't find this funny.
{140891}{140969}We were having|a serious conversation.
{141082}{141139}{y:i}It's okay for the helium.
{141139}{141199}Here, give me your finger.
{141243}{141332}Is that alcohol?|That's really forbidden.
{141331}{141382}Do you have|any other complaints?
{141382}{141499}Just make a list, and we'll|stick it on the porthole, okay?
{141496}{141561}- Suck your finger.|- Stop kidding around.
{141560}{141672}It's dangerous|at this pressure, alcohol.
{141669}{141730}Enzo, it's very deep down here.
{141754}{141804}Come on, suck your finger.
{141965}{142046}I will be seeing mermaids everywhere.
{142181}{142295}A thousand commanders, and we get|the Belgian from Alcoholics Anonymous!
{142461}{142501}See?
{142774}{142860}Come, let's go.|Hey, let's go.
{142945}{143025}- Enzo, where do I put my feet?|- Okay.
{143022}{143086}Wait, wait, wait!|Where do I put my feet?
{143284}{143334}Can you hear me?
{144258}{144306}I didn't get|the fucking commercial.
{144638}{144704}So, did you see your therapist?
{144746}{144824}- Yeah.|- What did he say?
{144872}{144931}He said I have|a decision to make.
{144931}{144987}The answer is within me.
{145054}{145134}- You paid for that?|- Yeah.
{145243}{145303}What did you decide?
{145303}{145364}Nothing.
{145398}{145471}Jesus,Joey, you're driving me crazy|with this already!
{145469}{145551}I mean, you don't even want|to go shopping anymore.
{145549}{145597}You don't want to talk|about my career no more.
{145597}{145651}You don't want to do anything|that you used to want to do.
{145651}{145740}All you want to do is talk about|this guy that you don't even know!
{145738}{145826}Just make a fucking decision!
{145824}{145863}Okay.
{145940}{145978}Heads, stay.|Tails, go.
{145979}{146035}Okay?
{146288}{146365}- Stay.|- Good.
{146383}{146425}Bad, very bad.
{146426}{146500}We weren't being cheated by|the Mafia or anyone, except you.
{146498}{146628}I know you think l'm a terrible person.|l'm not a terrible person.
{146699}{146777}I fell in love.
{146776}{146874}I mean, I really fell in love.|Do you understand?
{146872}{146957}I understand I could|have you arrested for fraud.
{146955}{147062}l'd be happy to pay you back, but I|just don't happen to have the money now.
{147059}{147167}- If you dock my salary $20 a week--|- Don't be cute,Johana.
{147165}{147213}I guess this is where|you fire me.
{147213}{147288}- You're right, you're fired.|- Thanks.
{147323}{147400}All right, who is this guy?|This lucky guy?
{147466}{147537}Remember Laurence in Peru?|It's one of his divers.
{147536}{147625}- The Popsicle stick?|- Yeah. No, it's a different guy.
{147694}{147770}Well, l'm happy for you.
{147831}{147879}Good luck.
{148249}{148276}Hello.
{148302}{148400}Jacques?|It's Johana.
{148425}{148462}How are you?
{148502}{148541}Good.
{148567}{148597}I got fired.
{148637}{148703}I got this job with Enzo.|We got fired too.
{148746}{148790}Really?
{148840}{148880}Strange.
{149042}{149089}Talk to me some more.
{149089}{149193}It's hard, you know? I don't know|what else to say. You're so far away.
{149241}{149286}Tell me a story.
{149337}{149369}A story?
{149482}{149553}Do you know how it is--
{149552}{149629}Do you know what you're supposed|to do to meet a mermaid?
{149732}{149804}You go down to the bottom|of the sea...
{149803}{149884}where the water|isn't even blue anymore...
{149883}{149951}where the sky|is only a memory...
{149949}{150044}and you float there|in the silence.
{150042}{150113}And you stay there...
{150112}{150182}and you decide that|you'll die for them.
{150180}{150243}Only then do they|start coming out.
{150242}{150388}They come and they greet you and|they judge the love you have for them.
{150383}{150467}If it's sincere...
{150465}{150514}if it's pure...
{150554}{150626}they'll be with you...
{150624}{150673}and take you away forever.
{150867}{150933}I like that story.
{153745}{153776}What is it?
{153830}{153878}I think I love you.
{154730}{154835}- You live here?|- Yeah, sometimes.
{155216}{155301}- Who's that?|- That's my Uncle Louis.
{155447}{155517}- I can't get him out of the bathtub.|- Sorry.
{155895}{155933}Assassin!
{155974}{156012}Uncle Louis.
{156012}{156082}- This is my friend,Johana.|- Hi.
{156121}{156170}Johana is visiting me.
{156170}{156234}He's a bit deaf.|He's 75.
{156234}{156298}It's very nice to meet you,|Uncle Louis.
{156800}{156905}So, where are you from, Henrietta?
{156903}{156953}Johana!|New York!
{157001}{157069}New York?|What kind of name is that?
{157068}{157120}No, l'm from New York.
{157120}{157252}Oh, yes!|The best lays are from New York.
{157349}{157398}Uncle Louis...
{157444}{157492}Johana is my friend.
{157624}{157713}She's come to stay with me...
{157754}{157789}for a while.
{157788}{157894}Good. That way,|l'll see more of you.
{157892}{157966}- Where are you gonna stay?|- Here.
{157965}{158043}Here? In my apartment?
{158074}{158111}It's my apartment.
{158111}{158190}Liar! Thief!. Torturer!
{158189}{158269}Uncle Louis,|go back to your bathtub.
{158290}{158345}l'm going to put a lock|on the telephone.
{158432}{158487}Have some more wine,|Uncle Louis.
{158551}{158606}Thank you, Henrietta.
{158631}{158696}l'll change my name.
{159085}{159180}This is, uh, my room.
{159579}{159630}Enzo phoned.
{159629}{159716}He's coming over next week|for another competition.
{159715}{159794}Great.|Are you gonna compete too?
{159837}{159874}Yeah.
{160068}{160116}Are you sure|you'll be all right here?
{161413}{161456}It's not like him to be late.
{161456}{161518}Of course, sometimes|he doesn't show up at all.
{161517}{161594}- Remember in Capri--|- Two dollars?
{161593}{161713}You didn't even need|to catch the fish!
{161709}{161766}It died of cancer!
{162098}{162135}Where did you get that?
{162135}{162209}"That"?|This is not a that.
{162208}{162300}This is Bonita Mariposa,|the famous Spanish actress...
{162297}{162368}who is going to be very careful|with the varnish...
{162367}{162407}Hello, darling.
{162407}{162472}and who has come|to spend a few days with us.
{162471}{162524}- Hi.|- l'm Bonita.
{162553}{162617}- Nice to meet you.|- Where is Mamma?
{162615}{162684}You have eight hours|before she gets here.
{162805}{162870}He's really going totally deaf.
{162894}{162983}l'm not as deaf|as you are blind!
{162981}{163094}You take care of your eyes,|and l'll take care of my ears!
{163091}{163139}l'm sorry, Uncle Louis.
{163185}{163265}Come on, drink up, my boy.
{163495}{163627}- Hey, tell me, what century is this?|- Second.
{163696}{163787}l'm glad you're here.|Thank you.
{163808}{163853}What's going on here?
{163853}{163920}We're just listening|to some musicwith Enzo.
{163965}{164026}Come on in.|This is Dr. Laurence.
{164092}{164176}So you must be the famous|Enzo Molinari, huh?
{164175}{164250}In the flesh.|I have that honor.
{164248}{164299}Yeah.
{164390}{164470}God, l'm getting wrinkles.
{164468}{164538}Mm-hmm, and l'm getting pimples.
{164594}{164692}- Are you gonna live here permanently?|- I don't know.
{164690}{164819}Things have happened so fast.|We haven't even talked about it.
{164815}{164898}You're very much in love.|I can tell.
{164928}{164979}Yeah, I am.
{164979}{165025}You have that look.
{165050}{165109}The look of a woman|who wants a baby.
{165109}{165193}Baby? No.
{165191}{165252}I haven't even thought|of having a baby.
{165252}{165315}I mean, really, God,|we're just...
{165314}{165376}starting to get to know each other,|and it'd be really--
{165374}{165423}Do I really?
{165423}{165506}Well, maybe he's not quite ready...
{165505}{165594}but he's a nice guy, sensitive.
{165632}{165717}Well, can't have a baby|by myself.
{165716}{165788}Why not?|I have a baby.
{165786}{165842}I loved his father.
{165841}{165935}We're not together anymore,|but I have his baby.
{166003}{166060}In the end,|you do it alone anyway.
{166530}{166605}Enzo Molinari for classification.
{166821}{166870}Yeah, "ciao."
{166870}{166923}What was his last time?
{166958}{167035}I don't know,|but it was really long.
{168685}{168737}Hey, that's not bad.
{168736}{168791}Bravo, Enzo.|{y:i}Magnifico. Bravissimo.
{168904}{168968}Very good, Enzo.|Very good.
{169265}{169350}So what?|Anybody can have a bad day.
{169348}{169413}Well, l've had many,|when the sea doesn't want you.
{169411}{169523}It's never the sea. It's Mamma,|Roberto, that stupid actress!
{169567}{169618}Don't break my balls.
{170131}{170202}Anyway, I have something|to tell you.
{170201}{170256}- l'm pregnant.|- "You're kidding!"
{170255}{170374}I knew you were gonna do that!|Because-- No, l'm kidding.
{170371}{170435}No, I wish I was.
{170435}{170474}Because.
{170541}{170618}l'll call you back tomorrow, okay?|No, I will, I promise.
{170969}{171017}Did you have a nice day?
{171048}{171097}Enzo had a bad day.
{171162}{171202}Did you dive?
{171322}{171370}Nah, it didn't feel right.
{171551}{171602}It's a cute baby, huh?
{171602}{171650}I love that baby.
{173979}{174019}My brother!
{174177}{174220}Bravo, Enzo, bravo.
{174221}{174283}Let them try.
{176643}{176692}Is he okay?
{177041}{177094}Okay. Yes.
{177477}{177596}- What are they doing?|- I don't know.
{177959}{178008}Not good.
{178592}{178632}Good dive!
{179008}{179059}How was it?
{179094}{179197}It was dangerous:|380 feet...
{179195}{179284}4 minutes and 50 seconds|under water.
{179282}{179316}Great.
{179502}{179555}Congratulations!
{179555}{179602}Thank you.|Thank you very much.
{179677}{179717}Bravo, Enzo!
{179890}{179972}Now-- Now--
{179970}{180039}l'm sure you've heard|that some people suggest...
{180038}{180104}it is too dangerous for us|to continue.
{180104}{180175}Dangerous because|we don't know how to measure...
{180174}{180267}the physiological consequences|of this type of dive.
{180265}{180397}Also because the scuba divers are|not used to going down below 300 feet.
{180443}{180534}But we asked the free divers...
{180532}{180657}and they all insist that|the competition continue.
{180855}{180920}Good luck to you all.|Good luck.
{181296}{181330}Sir--
{182713}{182761}One minute.
{183324}{183433}Three, two, one.
{185399}{185477}You're going past here?
{186115}{186151}Do you see him?
{186224}{186272}Hey! Do you see him?
{186656}{186704}Move up!
{187642}{187721}Bravo,Jacques.|Bravo.
{187824}{187869}Thank you.
{187869}{187909}Here.
{187998}{188122}Four hundred feet.|Four hundred feet!
{188325}{188361}That's fabulous.
{188513}{188553}You all right?
{188795}{188876}l'll be right there.|Hi. Come on in.
{188874}{188942}No, I wanted to say good-bye.
{188941}{189015}- You're leaving?|- Yeah.
{189014}{189090}Could you please|give this to Enzo?
{189089}{189138}Okay.
{189183}{189231}It's no use.
{189292}{189389}Just tell him I said good-bye|and give him a kiss for me. Okay?
{189386}{189460}- Promise?|- Promise.
{189512}{189561}Maybe you shouldn't|give up so easily.
{189594}{189644}Here's a present for you.
{189774}{189801}It's your baby.
{189830}{189891}Yeah.
{189891}{190007}Believe me,|it will change your life.
{190004}{190052}Only for the better.
{190098}{190189}You take care of yourself,Johana.
{190187}{190235}- You too.|- Bye.
{192139}{192179}Thank you.
{193364}{193438}Welcome to Greece,Jacques.|How are you?
{193437}{193490}Welcome,Johana.|Have a good trip?
{193490}{193576}Okay, let me give you|all the information. Come with me.
{193996}{194064}The smell of fish|is making me sick.
{194130}{194170}Why?
{194212}{194270}Would you get me|a glass of water?
{194768}{194816}Are you nervous|about the competition?
{195012}{195062}What's it feel like|when you dive?
{195214}{195283}It's a feeling of slipping|without falling.
{195365}{195419}The hardest thing is|when you're at the bottom.
{195467}{195502}Why?
{195618}{195666}'Cause you have to find|a good reason to come back up...
{195697}{195754}and I have a hard time|finding one.
{195932}{195980}Well, we have the same problem.
{196059}{196103}Why?
{196102}{196168}Because I have a hard time|finding a good reason to stay.
{196719}{196772}I found one.
{197180}{197280}- Is he here?|- Yeah.
{197347}{197379}Good.
{198436}{198487}It scares me when|you look at the sea like that.
{198652}{198706}I used to dive here|when I was a boy.
{198791}{198855}I have something|I want to talk to you about.
{198854}{198894}Not here.
{199146}{199173}Okay.
{199463}{199506}Can we talk here?
{199996}{200049}Let's talk about my world.
{200100}{200149}My world is you.
{200296}{200344}I love you.
{200409}{200470}I want to live with you.
{200503}{200553}I want to have a baby with you.
{200595}{200663}I want to have a house with you.
{200662}{200735}A car with you.|A dog with you.
{200734}{200766}You know?
{200766}{200847}Jacques, I think|I might be pregnant.
{200969}{201021}Did you hear me?
{201730}{201770}God.
{202200}{202273}Tomorrow is going to be|a big day.
{204381}{204487}{y:i}When I analyzed the data from Mayol's|{y:i}last dive, it became apparent...
{204485}{204526}that at the depths|these men are diving...
{204526}{204588}it is a physiological|impossibility...
{204586}{204657}that they can retain enough oxygen in|their blood to make it to the surface.
{204656}{204704}The pressure is so strong...
{204704}{204812}that it stops the oxygen|from circulating through the body.
{204810}{204940}To attempt to break Mayol's record|now is simple suicide.
{204990}{205037}Do you understand?
{205064}{205104}Yes, I understand.
{205147}{205203}But today's just training.
{205252}{205333}- Molinari's a 17-time world champion.|- Three minutes.
{205331}{205382}Do you want to tell him now|he can't dive?
{205519}{205577}Cancel the competition.
{205744}{205784}Two minutes.
{205926}{205971}Get Mayol in here.
{206107}{206147}One minute.
{206529}{206645}They want to cancel|the competition for a while.
{206685}{206748}Why?
{206747}{206807}It's not safe, they say.
{206903}{206986}The doctors say...
{206984}{207049}we can't go deeper and survive.
{207106}{207154}You say that because|you have the title.
{207154}{207246}No, I would never cheat you.
{207317}{207384}That's very nice of you.
{207557}{207634}Oh,Jesus!|I told you to tell him not to go!
{207633}{207686}It's not my fault.|I told him.
{207802}{207850}- No, no, no, no!|- And then they die!
{209665}{209704}Wonderful.
{209980}{210019}Get away!
{210064}{210104}Will you get away?|Goddamn it!
{210104}{210160}- Get away!|- Get out!
{210160}{210200}Give him some time.|Just leave him alone!
{210200}{210248}Get out!
{210305}{210345}Clear off!.
{210807}{210866}You were right.
{210915}{210964}About what?
{211005}{211079}It's much better down there.
{211167}{211216}It's a better place.
{211602}{211658}Push me back in the water.
{211686}{211734}No, I can't.
{211902}{211958}Take me back down.
{212144}{212186}Please.
{213491}{213525}Oh, look!
{214604}{214697}- Up with the arms, over the top!|- Come on,Jacques!
{214777}{214824}Let's get a heartbeat.|Come on.
{214824}{214892}Come on,Jacques!|Come on,Jacques.
{214940}{215015}Come back,Jacques!
{215014}{215053}Come on!
{215693}{215779}Jacques, stay with us!
{216352}{216468}Good. Good.|Good boy.
{216465}{216505}Good.
{216542}{216623}Got it?|Very good.
{217110}{217150}Here.
{217263}{217311}Better to sleep.
{217807}{217861}We'll talk later.
{217921}{217969}You sleep now.
{218243}{218292}I love you.
{218449}{218553}Dr. Laurence,|this just arrived for you.
{219068}{219116}I wasn't on the boat.
{219264}{219337}The only time in 20 years...
{219385}{219433}and I wasn't on the boat.
{219532}{219572}I must go now...
{219648}{219696}tell Mamma.
{220326}{220401}I know this isn't|a good time for this, but, uh...
{220400}{220483}I have the results|of your test here.
{220482}{220530}Yes, you're pregnant.
{220800}{220840}Are you happy?
{220869}{220937}- Yes.|- Good.
{220936}{220984}l'm happy.
{221042}{221093}l'm scared...
{221093}{221160}but l'm happy.
{221159}{221264}So, no more ouzo.
{221307}{221347}No more cigarettes.
{221416}{221454}You take care.
{221454}{221497}- Thank you.|- All right.
{226605}{226727}God. Laurence!|What is it?
{226724}{226822}Talk to me.|Dr. Laurence!Jacques!
{226917}{226965}Okay, wait a minute.
{227009}{227092}Let's talk to Laurence.|What are you doing?
{227091}{227146}Please, please, don't do this.
{227146}{227194}Look, don't do this.
{227193}{227241}Why are you doing this?
{227241}{227281}What--
{227450}{227544}Jacques, just talk to me.
{228656}{228703}l've got to go and see.
{228748}{228809}See what?
{228808}{228859}There's nothing to see,Jacques!
{228859}{228919}It's dark down there!|It's cold!
{228919}{228994}You'll be alone!|And l'm here!
{228992}{229067}l'm real!|I exist!
{229614}{229709}Jacques, I love you.
{229889}{229925}l'm pregnant.
{230117}{230161}Did you hear me?
{232067}{232121}Go.
{232121}{232170}Go and see, my love.
Between the time when the oceans drank Atlantis...
...and the rise of the sons of Aryas...
...there was an age undreamed of.
And unto this, Conan...
...destined to bear the jeweled crown of Aquilonia...
...upon a troubled brow.
It is I, his chronicler, who alone can tell thee of his saga.
Let me tell you of the days of high adventure.
Fire and wind come from the sky...
...from the gods of the sky.
But Crom is your god.
Crom, and he lives in the earth.
Once, giants lived in the earth, Conan.
And in the darkness of chaos, they fooled Crom...
...and they took from him the enigma of steel.
Crom was angered, and the earth shook.
And fire and wind struck down these giants...
...and they threw their bodies into the waters.
But in their rage, the gods forgot the secret of steel...
...and left it on the battlefield.
And we who found it...
...are just men.
Not gods, not giants.
Just men.
The secret of steel has always carried with it a mystery.
You must learn it, little Conan.
You must learn its discipline.
For no one, no one in this world, can you trust.
Not men, not women, not beasts.
This you can trust.
Hyah!
Kill that one!
Kill them! Crush them!
The ashes were trampled into the earth...
...and the blood became as snow.
Who knows what they came for?
Weapons of steel or murder?
It was never known, for their leader rode to the south...
...while children went north with the Vanir.
No one would ever know that my lord's people had lived at all.
His was a tale of sorrow.
Sit here.
Sit here.
He did not care anymore.
Life and death...
...the same.
Only that the crowd would be there to greet him...
...with howls of lust and fury.
He began to realize his sense of worth.
He mattered.
In time, his victories could not easily be counted.
He was taken to the East, a great prize...
...where the war masters would teach him the deepest secrets.
Language and writing were made available.
The poetry of Khitai, the philosophy of Sung.
And he also came to know the pleasures of women...
...when he was bred to the finest stock.
But always there remained the discipline of steel.
My fear is that my sons will never understand me.
We've won again.
This is good. But what is best in life?
The open steppe...
...fleet horse...
...falcons at your wrist, and the wind in your hair.
Wrong! Conan, what is best in life?
To crush your enemies, see them driven before you...
...and to hear the lamentation of their women.
That is good.
That is good.
Go. Go. You're free.
Go.
It has been surmised...
...that perhaps my lord was like a wild animal...
...that had been kept too long.
Perhaps, but whatever...
...freedom, so long an unremembered dream, was his.
Crom.
There's warmth and fire.
Do you not wish to warm yourself by my fire?
They said you would come.
From the north, a man of great strength.
A conqueror.
A man who would someday be king by his own hand.
One who would crush the snakes of the earth--
Snakes? Did you say snakes?
- What is it you seek?
- A standard.
A symbol.
Perhaps on a shield.
Two snakes coming together.
Facing each other...
...but they're one.
With-- With a sun and a moon below.
Black sun, black moon.
Yes.
There's a price, barbarian.
Zamora.
Crossroads of the world.
You will...
...find what you want...
...in Zamora.
Crom.
Food.
Food.
I have not eaten for days.
And who says you will?
Give me food so I have strength when the wolves come.
Let me die not in hunger...
...but in combat.
Who are you?
I am Subotai, thief and archer.
I am Hyrkanian, the great order of Kerlait.
So, what are you doing here?
Dinner for wolves.
What gods do you pray to?
I pray to the four winds.
And you?
To Crom.
But I seldom pray to him.
He doesn't listen.
What good is he, then?
Eh, it's just as I've always said.
He is strong.
If I die, I have to go before him...
...and he will ask me,
"What is the riddle of steel?"
If I don't know it, he will cast me out of Valhalla and laugh at me.
That's Crom, strong on his mountain.
- Eh, my god is greater.
- Heh, heh.
Crom laughs at your four winds.
Laughs from his mountain.
My god is stronger.
He is the everlasting sky.
Your god lives underneath him.
Civilization, ancient and wicked.
Have you ever seen this before?
No. Let's waste no time.
It's good.
You have no idea how long it's been there.
Stink!
Does it always smell like this?
How does the wind ever get in here?
How about two snakes coming together over a black sun?
A magnificent standard.
The only snakes I know of are those of Set, in those cursed towers.
They have spread to every city.
Two, three years ago, it was just another snake cult.
Now, everywhere.
It is said that they are deceivers.
They murder people in the night.
I know nothing.
Hey.
Black lotus. Stygian. The best.
This better not be Haga.
I would sell Haga to a slayer such as you?
- A pittance to protect you from evil.
- I am evil. Heh.
They're all sluts.
He's dead already.
Can you believe that? Huh?
- Ah.
- Can you be--?
You're too big to be a thief.
Come. Let's leave this place.
You looking for snakes?
They live in the Tower of the Serpent.
Said to have riches without end and the greatest jewel of all...
...the Eye of the Serpent.
Chew it slowly. It's the good stuff.
- You are not a guard.
- Neither are you.
We're thieves, heh, like yourself.
- Come to climb the tower.
- You don't even have a rope.
Two fools who laugh at death.
Do you know what horrors lie beyond that wall?
No.
Then you go first.
- What on earth could smell so bad?
- Do you wanna live forever?
That one.
He's the high priest, second only to Thulsa Doom.
They say Thulsa Doom's a thousand years old.
I'll see what's here.
Go find out what's below.
Infidel!
Infidels!
Kill them!
Do you wanna live forever?
All manner of pleasures and diversions were indulged.
Wealth can be wonderful.
But you know, success can test one's mettle...
...as surely as the strongest adversary.
They were taken to the hall of King Osric, the Usurper.
Once a powerful Northman like my lord...
...but now old and sotted.
These are the thieves you have requested, sire.
I thought there were three.
Uh, our companion, he died in the gardens.
Lions ate him.
Lions ate him?
Lions ate him.
You know what you've done?
Why, Rexor himself has come before me, threatened me, the king.
What daring! What outrageousness!
What insolence! What arrogance!
I salute you.
Thulsa Doom.
I've chafed for years at this demigod.
Snakes in my beautiful city.
To the west, Nemedia, Aquilonia.
To the south, Koth, Stygia.
Snakes. Everywhere, these evil towers.
You alone have stood up to their guards.
And what are you?
Thieves.
You see this?
They call it the Fangs of the Serpent.
And this one was thrust into a father's heart...
...by his very son.
And my own daughter has fallen under this Thulsa Doom's spell.
Is there a dagger such as this in her hand for me?
She follows him as a slave...
...seeking for the truth of her soul...
...as if I could not give it to her.
As we speak, my daughter travels east...
...to Thulsa Doom and his Mountain of Power.
She is to be his.
Steal my daughter back.
Take all you can carry.
There's more. There's much more.
Enough to become kings yourselves.
There comes a time, thief, when the jewels cease to sparkle...
...when the gold loses its luster...
...when the throne room becomes a prison...
...and all that is left is a father's love for his child.
To the hellfires with Thulsa Doom.
He's evil.
A sorcerer who can summon demons.
His followers' only purpose is to die in his service.
Thousands of them.
This Mountain of Power where he lives is said to be impregnable.
I have talked to Subotai and he agrees.
Let's take what we have while we live.
I have never had so much as now.
All my life, I've been alone.
Many times I've faced my death with no one to know.
I would look into the huts and the tents of others in the coldest dark...
...and I would see figures holding each other in the night.
But I always passed by.
You and I, we have warmth.
That's so hard to find in this world.
Please, let someone else pass by in the night.
Let us take the world by the throat and make it give us what we desire.
The children of Doom. Doom's children.
They told my lord the way to the Mountain of Power.
They told him to throw down his sword and return to the earth.
Time enough for the earth in the grave.
Ooh.
Once, great men lived here. Giants, gods.
Once, but long ago.
It was here that I met my master.
It was no accident...
...nor is it mere chance that I am the teller of his tale.
Hey!
I'm a wizard, mind you.
This place is kept by powerful gods and spirits of kings.
Harm my flesh and you will have to deal with the dead.
Can you summon demons, wizard?
Yes! I strike at you.
I would summon a demon more ferocious than all in hell.
Mounds have been here since the time of the Titans.
Kings buried in them, great kings.
Domains once glittered like the light on the windy sea.
Fire won't burn there. No fire at all.
That's why I live down here in the wind.
Do you care for these places?
I sing to them on nights when they wish.
I sing of the tales of battles, heroes, witches and women.
Nobody bothers me down here.
Not even Thulsa Doom.
Do flowers grow around here?
Flowers?
Flowers.
You've not come here as a pilgrim, have you?
Oil the sword and feed the horse.
Have you ever ridden one of those things before?
No!
Warrior, what are the flowers for?
For a girl.
Doom, Doom, Doom.
Doom.
Doom.
Where do you think you're going, brother?
I am afraid.
Afraid to bare yourself? Why?
You're so big and so well grown.
You should be proud of your body.
How do you expect to reach emptiness without knowing your own body?
Could we talk over there...
...where the others cannot see?
Why, yes, brother. Of course.
I am afraid and I am shy.
Is this, uh, your robe?
Priest's robe?
Yes, it's all I have.
Good.
That's all you'll ever need.
Brother.
What do you see?
Uh, infinity.
Good.
I see you.
I have watched you.
For a thousand years,
I have watched you.
Doom.
Doom.
Who among you still fears death?
Who will not face emptiness?
- Infidel!
- Infidel!
I wish to speak to you now.
Where is the Eye of the Serpent?
Rexor says that you gave it to a girl.
Probably for a mere night's pleasure.
Hmm?
What a loss.
People have no grasp of what they do.
You broke into my house, stole my property...
...murdered my servants and my pets.
And that is what grieves me the most.
You killed my snake.
Thorgrim is beside himself with grief.
He raised that snake from the time it was born.
You killed my mother.
You killed my father.
You killed my people!
You took my father's sword.
Ah.
It must have been when I was younger.
There was a time, boy, when I searched for steel.
When steel meant more to me than gold or jewels.
The riddle of steel.
Yes.
You know what it is, don't you, boy?
Shall I tell you? It's the least I can do.
Steel isn't strong, boy. Flesh is stronger.
Look around you.
There, on the rocks.
That beautiful girl.
Come to me, my child.
That is strength, boy.
That is power.
The strength and power of flesh.
What is steel compared to the hand that wields it?
Look at the strength of your body, the desire in your heart.
I gave you this.
Such a waste.
Contemplate this on the Tree of Woe.
Crucify him.
He said you were a wizard.
Do the gods owe you any favors?
There are dangers, but I see you care little for those.
The spirits of this place extract a heavy toll.
Then I will pay them.
Drink.
Sometime soon, perhaps tonight, they'll try to take him.
- And if they succeed--
- If they succeed, you'll follow.
No! No!
No!
Stop! Stop!
They're gone.
They're gone!
All the gods, they cannot sever us.
If I were dead and you still fighting for life,
I'd come back from the darkness...
...back from the pit of hell to fight at your side.
The old man says the Mountain of Power is hollow.
Thulsa Doom lives in the mountain.
What else does he say?
That in the back of the mountain, there's a gorge.
Many caves.
A thief could get in there, steal the princess...
...and be off before she's missed in the darkness.
Good thieves could do that, but not vengeful ones.
Only the girl.
We kill Thulsa Doom another day.
Agreed?
Conan?
So this is paradise.
Princess.
Get them!
Come on!
You.
Help him.
The infidel defilers...
...they shall all drown in lakes of blood.
Now they will know why they are afraid of the dark.
Now they will learn why they fear the night.
Seek.
The wizard.
I told him I would pay the gods.
Hold me.
Kiss me.
Let me breathe my last breath into your mouth.
I’m so cold.
So cold.
Keep me...
...warm.
Keep...
...me....
Hey. Fire won't burn up there.
No fire at all.
Why do you cry?
He is Conan, Cimmerian.
He won't cry.
So I cry for him.
He will kill you. He has seen your fires.
He will come for me, and when he does, he will kill you.
I remember days like this when my father took me to the forest...
...and we ate wild blueberries.
More than 20 years ago.
I was just a boy of 4 or 5.
The leaves were so dark and green then.
The grass smelled sweet with the spring wind.
Almost 20 years of pitiless combat.
No rest, no sleep like other men.
And yet the spring wind blows, Subotai.
Have you ever felt such a wind?
They blow where I live too.
In the north of every man's heart.
It’s never too late, Subotai.
No.
It would only lead me back here another day.
In even worse company.
For us, there is no spring.
Just the wind that smells fresh before the storm.
Hey, old man.
Where'd you get this stuff?
The dead.
The gods are pleased with you.
They will watch the battle. Heh.
- Are they going to help?
- No. Ha, ha.
- Well, then tell them to stay out of the way.
- Aah! Ha-ha-ha.
Crom...
...I have never prayed to you before.
I have no tongue for it.
No one, not even you, will remember if we were good men or bad.
Why we fought or why we died.
No.
All that matters is that two stood against many.
That's what's important.
Valor pleases you, Crom, so grant me one request.
Grant me revenge.
And if you do not listen, then to hell with you.
Hyah!
- That's how we do it.
- I did it. With my spear.
Do you wanna live forever?
Doom!
Don't leave me! My lord!
No, don't kill me!
Father!
Doom.
Doom.
The purging is at last at hand.
The day of doom is here.
All that is evil, all that have eyes...
...your parents, your leaders...
...those who would call themselves your judges.
Those who have lied...
...and corrupted the earth.
They shall all be cleansed.
Doom.
You, my children, are the water...
...that will wash away all that has gone before.
In your hand you hold my light...
...a gleam in the eye of Set.
This flame will burn away the darkness...
...burn you away to paradise!
Doom.
Doom.
My child.
You have come to me, my son.
For who now is your father if it is not me?
Who gave you the will to live?
I am the wellspring from which you flow.
When I am gone...
...you will have never been.
What will your world be without me?
My son.
Where is that real estate lady?
She probably meant four o'clock in the afternoon.
Four o'clock in the afternoon?
When does she sleep?
It's what we call a fixer upper.
Tell me, are we convenient to the school here?
Oh, yes, the school is just two blocks away.
And young children will walk past here regularly?
Do you two have children?
As often as we can.
Waldemar?
Ask no more questions.
We're supposed to be typical people looking for a home.
I am looking for a way into this house.
You ask normal questions.
Tell me, what does the building code say about filling the basement with earth?
Well, um, it is a finished basement.
Not yet it isn't.
Oh, I do love this house.
Um, there may be one small problem.
It doesn't matter what it cost.
Oh, it's not a matter of cost.
We must get into this house.
We've looked for such a long time.
A very, very long time.
For just this house.
Well, you see, a few days ago right after you called me...
"The disposition"
"of will shall be entrusted"
"to my friend and attorney,
T. Armstrong Sedgeway."
- Oh.
- You know,
I don't understand it.
Whenever I asked him for anything, he always said, "Leave it to me."
So I figured he'd leave something to me.
"And to my sister Lucille",
"who could always be counted on to borrow anything I had"
"and not return it,"
"I leave 3,000 overdue library books."
That's all?
That's all I get for being his sister all these years?
He does have one more thing for you.
After what everybody else has gotten,
I think we're better off he forgot us.
"And to my nephew
John and his wife, Mary,
"I leave my vast estate in Eerie,
"Pennsylvania."
Oh.
No.
John, our own house.
I played in that house when I was a little boy.
With all its surrounding land.
We'll have a garden.
Now we don't have to be afraid to let the children go out and play.
That house is mine.
"My attorney shall inform John and Mary"
"of the curse on the house."
Curse?
What curse?
Yes, well as I understand it...
We've inherited a house with a curse.
I do not intend to lose this house.
How 'bout this one?
There was a young girl from Hong Kong...
Billy, say goodbye to the nice truck driver.
Bye.
Oh, it's wonderful.
It's a wonderful house.
Mary, that's not the house.
This is the house?
You're gonna love it here.
I feel it in my bones.
Come on.
It's what we call a fixer upper.
It's what we call home.
I'm sure they won't stay very long.
I'm sure they won't.
I know they won't.
Oh, it even smells like Uncle Henry's house.
It's not going to smell like this much longer.
I'll be in college before we get rid of this smell.
Turn on the lights.
Maybe Uncle Henry didn't pay his electric bill.
I think this place is creepy.
All it needs is a little cleaning up.
Where's Rover?
Rover, Rover?
Come on, Boy.
Rover?
I wonder what got into Rover?
It's this place.
It's creepy.
Billy, why don't you go out and bring Rover in.
Billy?
Billy?
Billy?
"Billy?"
“ Billy?
Billy?
He's probably just hiding.
Remember when we went to Disneyland and he hid inside Pluto for two hours?
Billy, if you're hiding inside a big dog again...
I'm not staying here alone.
What?
This place is so creepy.
Who screamed? I heard a scream.
Where have you been?
Fixing the fuse box.
You guys don't wanna send me away to boarding school or something, do you?
Everything will be just fine.
You'd be amazed at what some nice curtains will do to this house.
I'm just worried about what this house is gonna do to me.
Hey, they haven't found it yet.
You can't be too sure.
I, I of all people, I can't be too sure?
Of course, I can be sure.
They haven't found it because we have to find it.
It started out to be an evening just like any other, but before it was over,
Millison Hackshaw would find herself in...
Was an innocent teenage girl.
She had no idea that the terrible events building around her would plunge her...
Is that what you call looking at the TV?
I've tried every channel and all I get is The Twilight Zone.
Her father opened the door and stepped out...
Lightning always does that to the TV reception.
A dimension of sight and sound and smell.
A dimension of Oriental...
It'll be alright once the storm is over.
A dimension of abandoned lumberyards.
A dimension of railway stations that have stopped being grand and are nowhere near central.
There's a train leaving from that station, and it's destination is Cincinnati, Ohio.
What storm?
“ Mary?
Mn'?
Come here, look at this.
It's some kind of a note.
It's from Uncle Henry before he died.
"Don't open the book."
What book?
He doesn't say.
I don't see any book.
Maybe it's a cookbook?
Oh, why wouldn't he want us to open a cookbook?
Well, you know how I am about my apple turnover recipe.
We're going to be very happy here.
I'm so glad we're here in our very own house.
Isn't it about time to go to bed?
I got all the dishes to do.
They'll still be here in the morning.
Well, they've been here a whole day.
They've gotta be ready to sell it by now.
It wouldn't be nice to wake them, but, maybe somebody's up around the side.
Maybe I'll come back later.
Maybe not.
Oh, no!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
What was that?
It must have been an owl.
You're right.
It was an owl.
Damn owls.
Oops.
The monster was here.
Calm down, you've just had a nightmare.
Come on, everything's gonna be alright.
- Except for the monster.
- Billy, Billy, there's no monster in here.
There is, he's nine feet tall, he has four arms, huge eyes on the top of his head and huge teeth.
Billy, act your age.
I am acting my age.
You're just used to me acting line a grown up.
I'm 10 years old, and there's a monster in here.
Billy, there's no monster here.
Look, do you see a monster in this room?
I can't believe that I'm standing here in the middle of night arguing with a 10 year old kid about the existence of monsters.
Now just calm down and go to sleep,
Everything will be fine in the morning.
Except for me, I'll be a faded memory in the morning.
I bet you were reading scary books again before you went to bed.
I...
Goodnight.
Sleep tight, don't let the bed bugs bite.
He had a nightmare.
He thought there was a monster in his room.
I guess it's just spending the first night in a strange house.
He'll be alright in the morning.
Monsters.
Mary?
Mary?
Mary?
I was good.
I didn't tell.
Okay, I told.
But he didn't believe me.
Mary?
Mary?
Mary?
Are you alright?
Yeah, fine.
Good.
“ Is Billy okay?
Yeah, everything's fine.
Wow.
Damn owls.
They found the book.
It's not fair.
For 300 years, I've been searching for that book.
Well, now you know where it is.
That's not the point.
Don't you understand?
Whoever controls the book, controls the world.
And now he's got it.
Two days from now there may not be a world.
Good morning.
Thank you for doing the dishes last night.
I didn't do the dishes.
Oh?
It must have been Debbie.
Or maybe there are elves in the house.
Elves.
I guess they could have used a little more sunlight.
Oh, that's better, darling.
They don't seem nearly as dead.
Well, it may have been noisy last night, but this morning the house feels so comfortable.
I don't think I slept
15 minutes all night.
Billy woke us up.
He had a nightmare.
And we kept hearing owls.
If you guys think I'm starting school today in this condition, forget it.
It'll be much quieter once we get curtains on the windows.
If you were so tired, you didn't have to get up early and do the dishes.
I didn't do the dishes.
- You didn't?
- Well then who did?
It must have been Billy.
Mom, when did you ever know Billy to do a dish?
Well, somebody did the dishes, and we're the only ones in this house.
If he could get out of the book, there's gotta be a book to tell you how to get them back in.
There's something creepy about this place.
It was a neighborhood not unlike any other neighborhood, but this was a day unlike any other clay.
We're going out to do some shopping.
We're going to buy some curtains.
Heavy curtains, this place will be quiet as a tomb.
Curtains and a few other things.
It seems that one of the windows was broken.
Yeah, it must have happened during my nightmare.
We'll see you in a little while.
Oh, Mom.
You didn't clean up my room, did ya?
I just put a few clothes away.
Don't wreck the house while we're gone.
See you later.
Bye.
We'll be back in a little while.
Oh, my god, what a bright, beautiful morning.
Yes, it is a bright, beautiful morning, and we're in our own home.
Yes, we are.
Stanley had been before...
- Hi.
- Hi.
Anything the matter?
Oh, no.
I got to work, I forgot my badge,
so I had to come and get it.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I kept hearing noises.
Take care.
If you need anything, just scream.
It' so reassuring to have a policeman living next door.
Billy, can you get that?
Hello?
This is the telephone company.
You got me out of the tub to tell me that?
Your telephone is going to be out of service for the next hour.
Good, now maybe I can take my bath.
This is a recording.
Hey, Billy, are you deaf or something?
The next one who gets me out of that tub is in big trouble.
Help!
Billy!
Billy!
Billy!
Billy, there's a fish in the bathtub.
There's a giant fish in the bathtub.
What?
Do something.
You're supposed to be the smart one in this family.
Will you just do something?
What do you want me to do, broil it?
How big is this fish?
. BU'
Do something.
I gotta get upstairs.
Ya gotta keep him busy.
What am I supposed to do?
Bring out the Monopoly set?
Do something.
I need time to get up to my room, okay?
Oh.
You've got to, just keep him away.
Debbie, run.
Get away.
This is what you call hanging up a few clothes?
If she moved that book...
I need the police, give me the police.
The Coast Guard, I need the Coast Guard.
I need help.
Everything alright in there?
No.
Help!
On my way.
Hold it right there, man.
Turn around, put your hands against the wall.
Help!
Stop right there or
I'll shoot.
No, no!
No!
I don't want any trouble with you.
Kill him, what are you doing?
Kill him!
Debbie, wake up.
You gotta help me find that book before Mom and Dad get back.
If they find out that this was my fault, come on.
Debbie, wake up.
There is another dimension for decent cheeseburgers, to a lost seven year old sits.
Where the bluebird of happiness still sings every morning.
Where the decent people who live next door could be from another planet.
Hi, we're back.
How's everything?
Oh, just fine, just fine.
Where's Debbie?
I think she's taking a bath.
Ah.
Debbie?
Debbie?
No!
It's me, it's your mother.
Debbie, are you alright?
I guess I fell asleep.
Oh, Mom, I had the creepiest dream.
Come on, come on.
We can make a deal.
What do you want?
Hey, how about food?
What do you like to eat?
Bad question.
This house is creepy.
Ah, there's nothing wrong with this house.
Then how come all we get on TV is The Twilight Zone?
Some shows are very popular.
I once watched television all morning and never say anything but I love Lucy.
Mom, this isn't I Love Lucy.
This is, there's a dimension of mind.
Oh, that's just your imagination.
You'll see, everybody will love this house.
Everybody?
You're the only one who loves it.
Everybody at the party.
What party?
Saturday night.
The relatives insisted on coming over, so we had to invite somebody we could stand, too.
To balance things out.
This Saturday night?
The 13th.
Mom, Friday's the 13th.
The 14th then.
Saturday the 14th.
I've gotta find that book.
Do this mean you want something to eat?
No.
Billy, you can't just mope around like this.
I won't be moping around much longer.
I'm glad to hear that.
You know, if you've got some problem...
Well, if you lost something...
"Yes?"
If you lost something and because you lost it the whole world was gonna be destroyed, what would you do?
Are you telling me you lost something?
Oh, hi, Deb, welcome home, you need some help?
Oh, thanks.
Remember those people who were trying to buy the house?
Yes.
Well, they were at the supermarket, and they asked me if we have any antiques we wanted to sell, and also they wanted to know about any old books.
Boy are they creepy.
You know, Dad, you really ought to sell 'em the house.
They'd fit right in.
Debbie, what would you do if you lost something and the world was going to be destroyed?
I'd call the police.
That wasn't the answer.
I wonder what Mom wanted this for?
She must be getting into European cooking.
Hmm.
Where is she, anyway?
What else, cleaning.
Hello?
Is anybody in there?
Hello?
You poor baby.
How long have you been up here?
Let's get you a bowl of milk.
Come on, kitty, kitty, here.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.
That can't be mice.
Not with a cat up here all this time.
Kitty?
Come on out.
Puss?
Puss, puss, puss, puss, puss, puss, puss.
Come on out, okay?
God, look at all these owls.
Hey, take it easy, huh?
Stop it, owl.
Ah, ah, ow.
Go on, I won't let them hurt you now.
Go on, my darling.
Take a little nap.
Electric, electrolysis, elevator, exercise, ah, there it is, exterminator.
Who ate my sandwich?
Not me.
Me, yeah, yeah, it was me.
I thought you weren't hungry?
Well, you know, excitement.
Excitement always makes ya hungry.
Excitement, ah, exterminator.
Ah, there's a good one.
Major Pest Control.
Major Pest Control.
This is the Major speaking.
My name is John Hyatt, and I've got bats in my belfry.
I'm an exterminator.
My belfry's full of bats.
They just attacked my wife.
Oh, you got bats in your belfry.
- A lot of bats.
- Do you know how many?
We charge by the bat.
I don't care what it costs as long as we get the bats outta here.
Yeah, okay, I'll send a man over, say, ah, next Tuesday.
No, right away, this minute.
I'm at 329 Elm Street.
Okay, I'll send him out.
Van Helsing?
Yeah?
Bats.
Bats!
329 Elm Street.
That sounds so hopeful.
So inviting.
So did 1827 Maple Street.
So did 4386 Brentworst Drive.
Sooner or later, my friend,
I will find a house where the bats did not come in through the window.
Sooner or later I'll be able to end my searching.
329 Elm Street, it doesn't sound like the end of the rainbow.
It's not that end of the rainbow that I'm looking for.
So, you're the man with bats in his belfry, aye?
You're the exterminator?
- Yeah.
- You don't look like an exterminator.
That's to fool the bats.
Oh, what have we here?
Nothing fires the imagination so much as a fine library.
Do you have any old books, any very old books?
Maybe you better ask Billy.
He's the smart one in the family.
No, no, no, old books.
I always throw my old books away when I'm finished reading them.
Old books can be worth quite a lot of money.
Take this to my room.
Your room?
Well, you don't expect me to get rid of bats overnight.
I guess you can use the guestroom.
He is really creepy.
Down at the exterminator place, we have a little motto.
When I leave this house, there will be nothing left here to be afraid of.
Ah, this must be your charming wife.
What's for dinner?
I think Mary bought a roast.
Debbie, why don't you start cooking while I show our guest to his room.
You know, it sure gets dark early since we've moved here.
It's getting creepy.
Are you still having nightmares?
I don't even have to be asleep.
Listen, we've gotta work on Mom and Dad to just sell this place and move.
They can't sell it.
It's part of Uncle Henry's will.
They sell the place, the money goes back to the estate and all those vultures split it up.
Oh, so we're stuck here?
Not for long.
Boy, even my own brother's getting creepy.
Dad!
Just rest.
It'll be alright.
I wonder...
What?
I wonder if I'm pregnant.
Help!
The man next door...
What's the matter?
- No, it, it, it, it,
- What, what?
- It's in the kitchen.
- The man next door is in the kitchen?
I wonder what he wants?
Well, whatever he wanted, he must have found it.
He probably just needed a cup of sugar or something.
But he was...
He...
It was an excellent meal.
I could stay here forever.
Darling, have a little piece.
No, thank you very much.
Sweetheart, have a taste.
You'll love it.
Debbie used a lotta garlic.
No, no, garlic, keep it away!
Thank you very much.
Maybe we oughta get you some pickles and ice cream.
You have been developing strange eating habits since you've been here, yeah?
No, no, that's just a little joke.
You know, about being...
- About being what?
- It's personal.
About being pregnant.
Oh, you're going to have a baby.
Really, Mom?
Really?
Do you know who's baby it might be?
I don't like that kinda talk.
You remember Rosemary.
She had a baby.
I don't even know that I'm having a baby.
It may be just a...
Just what?
A strange feeling.
And it started since you came to live here.
That book is in this house.
Book, what book?
What book?
The book.
Why do you think that you have strange things happening to you?
Why do you think you have bats?
We have bats because of a book?
You have more than bats.
You have problems.
If anything happens to that book, the whole world has problems.
If someone should open that book, his soul will be doomed to eternal hellfire and damnation.
Hell!
I've followed this book around the world for many, many years.
More years than you would care to hear of.
And now, at last, I know where it is.
Where is it?
What?
- What?
- What?
It's gone.
You had it?
You didn't open it, did you?
Oh, boy'
I didn't know.
Will someone please tell me what this is all about?
After all, I am the man of the house here.
Your book of evil!
Evil?
Evil.
All the evil that there's ever been.
In one book?
Boy, a book like that would be a bestseller for sure.
All of that evil is loose here in this house.
Well, I guess it's time to sell the house.
Oh, yeah.
Ah, you said you knew some people who wanted to buy it.
Let's give that nice real estate lady a call.
We are not going to sell this house.
"But, Mom?"
This is our home now.
We, we belong here.
Selling the house now would be like closing the barn door after the horses have eaten your children.
So what are we supposed to do?
Well, for one thing, we better cancel that party.
You're having a party here, now?
We were having a few people over tomorrow night.
Tomorrow night?
Saturday the 14th?
Do you know what's gonna be waiting here for those people?
Maybe we better just let the relatives come.
No, let everybody come.
We can use those people.
Their energy.
And we will triumph.
But I have a great deal of work to do in the next 24 hours.
And boy, find that book.
Mary?
Mary?
Go where you hid the book and bring it to me.
Bring me the book, my darling.
Good.
Bring me the book, and we'll fly off together.
Yes.
Yes.
The book.
Okay, go back to bed.
I'll think of another way.
Incantations for every occasion.
Every occasion but finding that book.
Turning bill collectors to stone.
Day to day.
He is in there and we're out here.
He's got that book by now.
If he had that book by now, he wouldn't still be in there.
But we'd still be out here.
- You could go in there.
- I could.
You always do.
You're starting to like that woman, aren't you?
She's not my type.
She's hundred of years too young for me.
I'd like to take a look at her neck.
Honey, all I'm after is the book.
Maybe I'll go in with you tonight.
Well, if you don't trust me after 311 years of marriage...
We'll talk about this when I get back.
I'm going with you.
I wish I'd never learned to do this.
It's so unattractive.
I'll get that book if it kills us.
It doesn't matter where we live,
I've always got the longest walk to the bathroom.
This isn't the bathroom.
This is the kitchen.
What am I doing in the kitchen?
What are they doing in the kitchen?
How am I gonna get out of the kitchen?
I'm trying to find that book, and all she can think about is that hooker woman in London.
That was a hundred years ago.
Oops.
Can't take you anywhere.
If you weren't immortal, you'd kill yourself.
Oh, look.
Isn't that that burglar
Larry from Budapest?
No, that's a fruit bat from the Philippines.
I just hope this isn't going to be another little incident like that hooker woman.
That was a hundred years ago.
I know, you're overdue.
Oh, we meet again.
I thought I settled your hash last time.
I'm stronger now.
I know how to deal with your kind.
We were here first.
I got inside the house first.
We tried to buy it.
But you didn't, now get out of my house.
Not without the book.
You will never get it.
Do you know what one drop of this will do to you?
One drop?
Darling, maybe we had better go.
But we'll be back.
And I'll be ready for you.
Some vampires will believe anything.
Not bad.
Not good, but not bad.
I think maybe it's time you all just got outta this house.
You think it's that easy?
You thinking you can just go waltzing through the front door, and all the evil in the world will just politely fade into the woodwork, yeah?
You want to leave?
Go ahead, leave.
Go on.
Walk out the door.
Walk out on your family.
Forget your sister.
Forget your responsibilities, go ahead.
I've gotta get outta here.
What is it your afraid of?
Open the door.
Have you had enough?
Close it, it's freezing in here.
You see?
You can't leave.
But I've gotta go to school Monday.
By Monday, all of this will be over.
It'll be over tomorrow night at the party.
One way or the other.
You know what this kitchen needs is some decoration.
You could hang strings of garlic.
Mary doesn't seem to be as fond of garlic as she used to.
Garlic is very attractive in a kitchen this color.
No, thank you.
I never drink coffee.
I'll take it.
Without my first cup of coffee in the morning,
I can't see straight.
We had a house once in Bavaria.
We had so much garlic hanging, we couldn't find the stove.
We couldn't even smell the stove.
That kitchen made the cover of Better Homes and Garlic.
Oh, I've gotta get outta here.
There must be something we can do.
- Oh, there is.
- What?
Well you can, you can put out big bowls of potato chips, and you can make a nice onion clip.
Potato chips?
Onion clip?
Is that what monsters eat?
No, that's what people eat.
I'm not hungry.
Well, you're having a party tonight.
Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.
You forgot about the party?
The whole world is depending upon this party.
Now, we need onion dip, we need club soda, we need old Barbara Streisand records.
The people at this party have to be as happy as any people ever were.
We need all the positive energy that we can get our hands on.
Positive energy?
We better call the relatives and tell 'em not to come.
Why don't you do it?
I'm gonna check on your mother.
Here, take this coffee.
Huh, I can't stand the sight of it.
I think the circuits are busy.
Yeah, you know, it's cheaper to call before eight o'clock.
Circuits are probably just jammed with people trying to save 15 cents.
Yeah, right.
I'll call again after eight.
Mary, are you alright?
What's this?
What's what?
All this dirt?
Your whole side of the bed is covered with earth.
I, I must have spilled a flower pot.
Well, we'll have to get this cleaned up.
No, no, thank you, I'll clean it myself later.
I have to get some sleep now.
Give me a kiss, darling.
Oh, let me just see who that is.
I'll be back for that kiss.
Yeah?
Hi, liquor store.
No, private residence.
- Yeah?
- No, no,
I am from the liquor store.
Ah.
- You called last night?
- Yeah.
Potato chips, club soda, onion dip, Streisand records.
Yeah, come in.
Put it in the kitchen.
I would help you with it,
but I, I hurt my back in Crimean War.
Maybe it'd be better today if you played inside.
I've gotta get out of this house.
I'm a 10 year old kid.
I'm supposed to be out in the sunshine.
You'll never know the contribution you've made for saving the world.
Who's that guy?
Have a nice day now?
Boy, these storms come up all of sudden this time of year.
You folks mind if I wait it out here for a few minutes?
George and Elizabeth Benson get into their car to go to a party, but this wasn't going to be the kind of party they expected.
The guest are about to arrive.
Billy, will you turn that thing off?
- I did turn it off.
- The hors d'oeuvres have been prepared in the...
Oh, feed me.
Young man, we're gonna have dinner in just a few minutes.
There are many ways of fighting evil.
Huh, many ways.
This could take hours.
When are those people coming?
I'll get it.
- I'll get it.
- No, I'll get it.
- Uh-oh.
- Everybody always gets so excited about the first guests.
But, Mom, there's something horrible out there.
Ah, you really are living here.
You're right, there is something horrible out there.
Aunt Lucille.
Uncle Bert.
Here's a little something from all of us.
An electric can opener.
Well, the place feels just the same as it did when Uncle Henry died of a...
Mary.
Mary quite contrary.
Quite beautiful.
Hey, John...
Oh, sweetie.
This place could blow up any minute now.
I could get you a disaster policy.
- Would it go into effect now?
- Look how pale he is.
Don't you ever let him out?
I'm gettin' 10%.
- Oh, such a cutie.
- Hey, John...
- Oh, my little cutie.
- Hi, there.
I'm Phil, Johnny's cousin.
- Want a drink?
- You call those hors d'oeuvres?
Yeah, I could go for something.
- What have they got?
- I don't know.
This one's got no meat on it.
Which way is the bar?
What have we here?
How long have they been here?
- Bring on the food.
- Do bring it on.
Phil wanted to sell me disaster insurance.
- On this house?
- Disaster, what is it?
That man deserves everything that comes to him.
I thought you were going to use these people to get rid of the monsters?
- I am.
- Aunt Lucille, let me take you coat.
Oh, no, no, dear.
I'll hang it up myself.
Otherwise, how could I look in your closets?
Who is that kid on the sofa?
I don't know.
Terrible place, I would never live in here.
Oh, god.
Ah, there's the closet.
Let's see who's skeleton is in it.
Well, the nerve of her.
Buying a coat just like mine.
Hello?
Hi, I'm Annette
Muldowney from next door.
I hated to come alone, but I haven't seen my husband in two days.
Well, he's a policeman.
He's probably working overtime.
The crime is so terrible these days.
They've been getting killed everywhere you look.
Well, I'm glad one of you could make it.
Come on.
I brought you a little something.
It's an electric can opener.
It's exactly what I needed.
- Oh.
- Thank you.
I'll see if we can use it at the bar.
Come in.
Banana daiquiri.
Banana daiquiri.
The world is coming to end and they make me the bartender.
Ah, I haven't mixed a drink since that time Attila the Hun got drunk and wrecked Mongolia.
Anyone had the banana daiquiri?
Ah, Mary, have you seen Lucille?
Not since she went to, to hang up her coat.
I can't find her hiding ever.
How does your garden grow?
You have to find somebody else to be bartender.
I brought you this can opener.
That'll make it easier.
I have things to do.
People are already disappearing.
Where's Billy?
I need him for this.
He's right...
I'll find him.
If anything has happened to that boy, we'll be sunk.
Mary?
Have you seen Billy?
Mary, this ice is so old.
Have you seen Billy?
Yeah, he's ri...
Oh, he must have gone upstairs.
You know how kids hate grownup parties.
Debbie?
Have you seen Billy?
Find him.
Okay.
Debbie?
Who's that guy?
I don't know.
You haven't found the boy yet?
We haven't even looked yet.
Well look, look high and low.
It's almost 11:30.
If we don't have that boy by midnight, things are going to get extraordinarily unpleasant.
People.
Everybody.
I have an announcement to make.
We're going to play a little game.
Somewhere in this house is hidden a small boy.
Let's see who is the first to find him.
What do we win?
You win, win, what do you win?
Oh, you, you get to keep the boy.
- No.
- Ah, no, no.
Ah, you, you, ah, you get an electric can opener.
- Good
- Oh.
Alright.
Billy?
"Billy?"
Billy?
"Billy?"
The book, it's gone.
Beryourhomen, grainen, consacrat.
"Billy?"
Billy?
Are you here?
"Billy?"
Billy?
Now this worked on that other little boy.
How the hell did it go?
You look here,
I'll go in here.
Holler if you see anything.
Right.
Billy?
Billy?
My, god.
It's what we call a fixer upper.
Oh.
"Billy?"
Find your own place to look for him.
I think it's real...
You haven't seen the little boy, have you?
Ernie.
Oh, thank god you're here.
Ernie, do something.
Oh.
Oh, oh, oh.
Bill?
Bill, will you answer me?
Oh, thanks.
I almost broke my neck.
- You found him?
- We looked everywhere.
In one minute, terrible things are going to happen.
Less than a minute.
The monsters are taking over the house.
We're all doomed.
Doomed!
Who could that be?
Everybody I'd invited has already shown up.
- And left, I'll get it.
- I'll get it.
- I'll get it.
- I'll get it.
I believe this what you've been looking for, Van Helsing.
- Billy.
- Stop, don't touch that boy.
Give me that book.
Not so fast.
We have no time to lose.
Billy, my boy, will you kindly hand me that book?
Give him the book, Billy.
He's the only one who can get rid of the monsters.
He is the monster.
Give me the book.
I know who you are.
You're in this book.
They showed me.
I can make you very strong.
Never.
Come on, Billy, quit fooling around.
Your powers are nothing compared to mine.
When I get that book,
I will rule the world.
Think of it.
Famine, war, death!
Those we've got.
And you will be the first to die.
No one will stop me.
I never liked that lamp.
Why, that was your mother's table.
Was it?
Mm-yeah.
Na, na, na, na, na.
The fireplace, it's burning.
I am your master.
Once the book is destroyed, you will never be imprisoned again.
The army of night will rule the world.
It can't get any creepier than this.
Help me, please
I know, nobody's gonna be fine.
Let go of this book, boy.
It killed the monsters, and it'll kill you.
Nothing can kill Me.
No, no!
We won, we won.
It's Rover, Rover's back.
He thought destroying the book would free the monsters.
That wasn't the way it worked.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you.
I had a, um, a, um, swell party.
Have a nice clay.
You too.
We don't know who he is.
Well, at least he's gone.
Come here, boy.
Good boy, Rover.
Good boy.
I think they've had enough of this house.
I think so, too.
It's time they lived happily ever after.
And us, too?
Of course, darling.
Whoa, lordy!
Wooo, wow!
Lemme outa here! Oh feet, do yo' stuff.
Wu-huh! Wu-huh! Woooow!
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
[Panting]
[Upbeat instrumental music]
[Rock music]
Going down down down
How far can you go?
You might fall into the Forbidden Zone
Going round round round
Driving me insane
Everything looks different but nothing has changed
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
Living in the Sixth Dimension
Things get rough
Living in the Sixth Dimension can be tough
It's so hard when you're on your own
When you're on your own
Going down down down
How far can you go?
You might fall into the Forbidden Zone
Going down down down
Cross the border line
The guards look scary
But the girls are pretty fine
Okay! I'm a-going down, I'm a-going down,
I'm a-going down
I know
Turnin' me around, turnin' me around, turnin' me around,
I know
Thank you very much for that delicious breakfast.
It was absolument superbe!
[Groans in disgust]
I'd like to chat with you longer... however, I regret that
Flash and I have to hurry along to school.
As I am a new student,
I don't want to make a bad impression.
Yeah. The principal, Mr. Yodlebein, sent out bulletins to all the classrooms... and he said that if anybody's gonna be late, they're gonna be punished.
Oh, children, don't be late for school.
And, Flash, be sure you tie your grandfather up... and check the knots real good.
While he was sniffing around for food yesterday... he nearly wandered into the Forbidden Zone.
The Forbidden Zone?
Qu'est-ce que c'est que ça, alors?
What are you ever talking about?
Squeezit Henderson's got a brother that dresses like a broad.
And he took us down into the basement... and showed us those funny games, you know, like the adults play... and he went through a door, and he never came out.
A door leading to the Sixth Dimension?
How strange, yet intriguing.
Just imagine the adventurous world beyond that door.
You don't ever...
You don't ever, you don't ever....
[Comical instrumental music]
[Singing]
Behind them doors
You don't go through
That is one thing
You do not do
Sin and evil
That's what you'll find
You'll meet two baldheaded devils there with wild sex on their minds
The King and Queen of that terrible underworld
They capture and torment all the little sweet young girls
You can't be serious, Pa,
It sounds like heaven! Ha! Ha! Ha!
I think I'll move there, you stupid, silly father
[Jazzy instrumental music]
Stay away from that door, my little daughter
You'll miss yer daddy
You'll miss yer mama
One of these days
You'll be sad and lonely
Some of these days, Laday la hey
You're gonna be so lonely
Some of these days
You're gonna want me only
You'll miss my lovin', miss my kissin'
You're gonna miss your little daddy
When you goes away
You'll be so lonely
For me only, you know, baby
Why I went away
Oh, when I'm leavin'
You don't know
About how your heart be grievin'
You'll miss your little daddy, mama
Some of these days
[Jazzy music continues]
[Singing nonsensically]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Women screaming]
[Women screaming continues]
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
Holy cow. It's ten to 9:00.
Come on, Gramps, we gotta tie you up now.
FRENCHY: Oh, la, la, we'll be late for school.
[Singing]
Beautiful dreamer
Come unto me
[speaking Pig Latin]
Ewww! Squeezit Henderson.
Will you get a load of that jerk, will you?
Ewww!
Hey, Frenchy, you got a Kleenex?
I got something stuck in my throat.
No, sorry.
[Slow instrumental music]
SQUEEZIT: Hi, Flash. Hi, Frenchy.
FLASH: How you doing, man?
Flash told me that you have a twin brother that disappeared behind the door... in our basement.
It's not my brother, it's my sister.
FLASH: It's your brother, he only acts like a broad. He's a faggot.
You're the faggot.
Do you think you'll ever see your sister again?
You know, I think I've accomplished astral projection with my sister.
FLASH: Ah, banana oil.
Formidable, alors! How fascinating.
You'll have to tell me everything about it.
Well, last night, my mother was punishing me again... and I begged her to stop hurting me, but she wouldn't.
And finally the pain got so intense and unbearable that I felt like I was dying... and leaving my body, and then I had this vision of my sister... that was so real, I could see her as clearly as I'm looking at both of you right now.
[Humming]
[Humming continues]
[Singing]
I kept rubbin', rubbin' on the darned old thing
Ow! Ow! Ow!
FAUSTO: Don't push your luck, Henderson.
Chérie.
Fausto, 1,000 years... and for some reason,
I just can't get enough of you.
[Soft instrumental music]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
Everything got black. I must've fainted.
How amazing.
FRENCHY: And she disappeared in our own basement.
In your own basement.
Well, so long, Squeezit.
Come on, Sis,
Miss Feldman will mark us tardy.
Come on, Squeezit, we're going to be late for class.
[Bell ringing]
[Students shouting]
JOHNNY: You fucking kid!
You motherfucking kid!
JOHNNY: I told you not to do that, you motherfucker.
JOHNNY: I'll kill you, you son of a bitch.
JOHNNY: You fucking bitch.
You motherfucker.
I'll kill you, you fucking bitch.
[Gun shots firing]
Squeezit Henderson, please come forward, and lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance.
[Grunting]
[All laughing]
[Mimicking cock crowing]
Class, we have a new student.
Flash's sister Susan will come and tell us of her studies in France.
[Upbeat instrumental music]
[Singing in French]
Le soir on cause d'un tas de choses
Avant de se mettre au pieu
J'apprends la géographie
De la Chine et de la Mandchourie
Les frontières, les rivières
Le Fleuve Jaune et le Fleuve Bleu
Y a meme l'amour c'est curieux
Qu'arrose l'Empire du Milieu
C'est moi qui suis sa petite
Son Anana, son Anana, son Anammite
Je suis vive, je suis charmante
Comme le petit oiseau qui chante
II m'appelle sa petit bourgeoise
Sa Tonkiki, sa Tonkiki, sa Tonkinoise
D'autre lui font les doux yeux
Mais, c'est moi qu'il aime le mieux
Man, I think I'll put up 400 on this one.
[Singing continues]
C'est moi qui suis sa petite
Son Anana, son Anana, son Anammite
Je suis vive, je suis charmante
Comme le petit oiseau qui chante
Check that out, man.
Hey, man, put that motherfucking chip back on the table.
Put the chip back on the table, man.
D'autre lui font les doux yeux
Mais, c'est moi qu'il aime le mieux
[All applauding]
-I'll blow your brains out.
-Hold me back, blood.
Hold you back nothing, I'll hold you back--
[Gun shot firing]
-Squeezit?
-Johnny just shot Billy.
-Johnny?
-Well, the man was cheating.
So I just had to do away with him, and that's all there was to it.
That does it, Johnny, you're going to Mr. Yodlebein's office.
You ain't taking me nowhere, you honky bitch!
I didn't want to come to school, no way!
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
[Gun shots firing]
Frenchy, come back, they'll mark you truant!
FRENCHY: Is anybody home?
[Mama grunting]
Mama, are you okay?
I guess I'm all right.
I'll be okay in just a minute.
-Just go out and play.
-Oh, okay.
I think I'm going to take a little peek behind that Forbidden Door.
I'm so curious, I can't resist.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Screaming]
[Screaming continues]
[Groaning]
Merde, alors!
Hot damn! The Sixth Dimension!
Do I detect a rhumba?
[Singing nonsensically]
[Singing in Spanish]
Bim Bam Boom, Bim Bam Boom
Es el nuevo campás
Que los negros van bailando en la comparsa
Bim Bam Boom, Bim Bam Boom
La mulatona Mercedes arrollando va detrás de la comparsa
Ya no quieren cumbanchear las negritas del solar
Si no tocan al compás de este ritmo así
Suénalo, báilalo, gózalo
Bim Bam Boom, Bim Bam Boom iQué sabrosito está
Este paso arrollador de la comparsa!
[Singing nonsensically]
PRINCESS: Stop the music! Stop the music!
Seize the intruder.
She must be taken before my parents.
BOTH: Go along with the Princess now, and don't be cheeky.
[Upbeat instrumental music]
Be sure and call me if they decide to snuff her.
[Drum roll]
[Trumpets playing]
Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness... like pillar of smoke... perfumed with myrrh and frankincense?
Just another slab of meat for my dungeon.
Quel bordel de merde.
FAUSTO: Thy speech is comely.
FRENCHY: Enculé.
Thy lips are like threads of scarlet.
This isn't very amusing, darling.
Why do you waste your words on this piece of petit-fois?
Oh, it's nothing, nothing, nothing... a mere outburst of the poet within me.
Take her to Cell 63.
You're Squeezit Henderson's sister, René.
Cheese it, it's the Princess!
My pet needs a mate.
Oh, he can do it to me. Honest!
Why don't you go down on your knees, and give him what he wants?
Oooo! You're really gonna get it.
You make a lovely couple.
[Upbeat instrumental music]
[Squeezit laughing]
Lucky, lucky, lucky the boss really noticed you.
-Oh, yeah?
-Uh-huh!
But how can he bear the touch of that loathsome Queen?
She's nothing but an old, fat whore.
The Queen is a very important person.
She hurts me a lot, but I respect her.
When I turned 12, Papa said:
''Little woman, better get yourself a wife''
[Singing]
'''Cause you're too mean for a man
She'll clean up your life''
''And if she's the Devil, you'll know she'll be your friend''
When I turned 13, I spat in my poppa's eye
Took off to find my man
'cause I couldn't find a wife
I spread-eagled in a lot of towns
I couldn't find no man to lay me down
They were so busy a-cock-a-doodle-doin'
But they still couldn't nail me down
So I grew up lonesome knowing there'd be no man or woman to get me goin' through this life
'Cause I was hatched out of a witch's egg
Been doomed to fly high
[Upbeat pop music] like a crane with no legs
I laid down with the Devil and his sidekick, mankind
But somethin' called lovin' made me hungry inside
So I went to the Lord and I asked him for more than what this world could offer
I laid down with him and I had to grin
'cause he was shyer than a flower
Now thanks to the Lord I've been set free
My lover is the trade winds that take me out to sea
My life is like nobody else's
There's only one of me
'Cause I was hatched out of a witch's egg
Been doomed to fly high
Like a crane with no legs
[Frenchy singing in French]
Pleures, pleures, oh pleures
Pleures, pleures sur ton malheur
Pleures, pleures, oh pleures
Pleures, pleures triste coeur
Pleures, pleures, oh pleures, pleures
Pleures, mouillés les fleurs
Pleures, pleures, pleures, pleures
Pleures sur ton bonheur
-Doris, you surprised me.
-Just what do you think you're pulling here?
-I was just only looking at her.
-Oh, yeah?
Listen, buster, looking's dangerous.
Next thing you know, you'll be sucking on her mangoes.
My, my, aren't you a jealous one?
Well, why shouldn't I be?
It gets on my nerves, you know.
You know, I must have my army.
I'm not about to compromise my position in life, my ancestry... my tradition, for your silly little suspicions.
Your army!
Where is your precious army?
I will have a whole army of Zombie.
A Zombie Marine Corps... a Zombie Navy Corps, a Zombie Space Cadets--
You're really out to lunch.
Look at this world you've cooked up.
And you expect to take over another universe?
You dumb fuck.
Just wait until these dead babies start marching... and you'll be eating your words.
I am waiting, Your Majesty, waiting for you to tell me... why that French slit is so special to you, and why you carry her photograph... around in your pocket.
FAUSTO: All right, I'll tell you.
She's French, and that's simple.
And therefore, she's of the master race... a direct descendant of God, just like me.
Direct descendant of God?
You just want to slip her the pork.
That does it.
I'm hopping the next bus out of here.
FAUSTO: You cannot mean that.
What will you do?
Just go on living, I guess.
Oh, chérie, ma petite coquette, ma petite princesse.
Mon petit chou, c'est rien.
[Queen Doris sobbing]
[Queen Doris moaning]
[Soft instrumental music]
Harder.
Frenchy! Harder!
I hope you were not treated badly.
I gave strict instructions for you to be put in our most cheery dungeon.
Why am I prisoner here?
It's for your own safety, chérie.
The Queen may have had you tortured... or executed, had it not been for my quick and decisive action.
-Vous-êtes artiste?
-Oh, no, no, no, no.
I am a soldier by profession.
This is only doodling, you know, to relax.
La couleur, la form, l'image!
C'est vraiment magnifique.
Vous êtes tres gentille.
It's nothing, nothing at all.

[Miss Feldman clearing throat]
FLASH: Squeezit, if you're too scared to help me rescue René and Frenchy...
FLASH: I'm gonna have to get that kosher fart grandfather of mine to help me.
SQUEEZIT: Yeah, but Miss Feldman will never let you out of class this early.
FLASH: Oh, yeah?
[Window pane shattering]
Gramps, come on, lean back.
Let me untie you.
We got to go save Sis.
[Upbeat pop music]
[Shouting]
[Both screaming]
[Both grunting]
Shit.
Come on, Gramps, let's go.
Change your foreign money to local currency.
Change your foreign money to local currency.
Okay, Mr. Bernstein, give me a quarter's worth.
Two craps. How do you like that?
Killer Rosenblatt, the famous Jewish wrestler.
I've read all about you in the paper.
Well, you see, Gramps, he can't hear you...
'cause he's so used to hollering at the opposition... he's deaf and dumb.
So what's a nice Jewish boy like you doing in the Sixth Dimension?
You see Gramps, we're here to find my sister Frenchy. She disappeared.
The French girl in 63?
Oy vey, oy vey, oy vey!
If the Queen should find out what the King is doing to that girl...
-She'd murder the poor girl.
-No kidding?
Tell me, Gramps, you got a way, maybe I can get my sister back?
Get his sister back, he says. Let me think.
I have a strategy that could get her back.
I could even bring Jesus Christ himself back again.
-For how much?
-For three shekels.
-Okay, three shekels. You got a deal, okay?
-Okay.
Here's three shekels.
Now I'll tell you....
[Speaking Yiddish]
[Adventurous instrumental music]
Wait a minute, Gramps. Hold it.
Let me get rid of this guy.
Hey, Bust Rod, here's a quarter.
Go get me a pack of cigarettes.
Camels, like a good fellow, that's the idea.
Come on, Gramps, let's go find Sis.
[Hollering]
I'll give you one last chance to live... you sniveling little weasel!
Tell me why you and the Fat One came into our Kingdom here.
If I tell you, will you let me and Gramps go and take one of the prisoners with us?
QUEEN DORIS: Of course, dear.
FLASH: See, we really came here... to rescue my sister, you understand? Frenchy.
Because Mr. Bernstein said that she's in great danger.
The King fell in love with her, and the Queen is jealous.
Oh. You're the Queen.
Lower the rope!
FLASH: Gramps!
But, Your Majesty, you promised.
Gramps, let go of what you're holding.
[Adventurous instrumental music]
Gramps, let go, I might fall!
Assemble all prisoners from Cell 63 into the Interrogation Cell.
But, Mommy, can't I watch some more?
They're still wiggling.
You heard me!
[Eerie instrumental music]
There she is, eyes so sweet
What a shame that soon they'll be glowing like some burning coal when I turn on the heat
Impudent, surly bitch
Soon you'll sing a different song
You'll plead for mercy, beg forgiveness
When I throw the switch
You don't scare me now
You don't scare me ever
Asking you for mercy or forgiveness now, never
Gonna throw the switch
Gonna throw the switch
Give it to the bitch
And give her plenty, make her scream
Ti yum titti tum titti tim titti tim hi-hay
[Upbeat music]
Give her all the juice, give her all the juice
Twenty thousand volts in her caboose
Will make her see the error of her ways
Frenchy is going to pay
Frenchy is going to pay
Look at her acting tough
Well, that's fine for now, honey
I've got plenty time to play and, sweetheart, I play rough
Getting late, say goodbye
Time to meet your fate
And I do hope that you're thinking of me
When you start to fry
Don't you worry, Mom, I will oversee now
Really, though, don't go to any trouble over me now
Give her all the juice
Give her all the juice
Twenty thousand volts in her caboose
Will make her see the error of her ways
Frenchy is going to pay
Frenchy is going to pay
The Queen will have her way
Frenchy is going to pay
This poor girl so fair
-Can this be her fate?
-Going to pay
Can there still be time?
Or is it too late?
Frenchy is going to pay
Oh, why must it be that life is so cruel?
The Queen will have her way
Frenchy is going to pay
Unfair and unjust
Must this be the rule?
Oh, darn. The fuse blew.
-Flash Hercules at your service, ma'am.
-Ma'am? I am the Ex-Queen!
I was once happily married to King Fausto... until that fat loathsome cow, Queen Doris... that silicone uddered pig stole the throne by seducing me... even though she's not my type.
She thinks I'm dead... because he, the King, couldn't stand to see me die... because he's such a coward, so he threw me a mile down in this cell... where I've been for 1,000 years, and to maintain my sanity...
I've been writing a screenplay, and it's so difficult... because there's no hot water, there's no fresh orange juice.
There's bats falling in my hair at night and roaches climbing through the pages... and so much dust on the keys... that I just can't stand it another minute!
Okay, Queenie, don't worry about nothing.
I'll get you out of this place.
Here, watch my magic propeller, and off we go.
Come on, Gramps, let's go find Sis.
I've got to change a Tampax,
I'll see you later.
You fuzzy bastard. Come on, Gramps.

[Comical instrumental music]
By the way, honey, when is that mentally retarded Swedish husband of yours... coming home, anyhow?
[Exploding]
[Man shouting]
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
Mmmm, hello there.
Hello there.
[Moaning]
[Exclaiming]
Hi, Pa. Gee, I'm glad to see you.
I'll get you out of here, Pa, don't worry, and then I'll go save Frenchy.
You leave me be.
In the real world up there,
I was just another rat... and down here, I also live like a rat.
So what's the difference? Go avay.
I vant to be alone.
Ah, banana oil.
You're gonna see your son in a minute.
He just turned 11.
What the frig are you talking about?
Me, a kid? Ruthy, come on.
You're the one, okay, you big gorilla.
You wanna see him, eh?
You wanna see Chicken Boy?
Oh, Chicken Boy?
You wanna see him? You wanna see
Chicken Boy? Oh, Chicken Boy?
[Laughing]
That's really rich.
-Mom, mom.
-Squeezit, meet your pop.
-Dad?
-I ain't your dad.
Unless we got chickens in the family.
Come here, baby.
Oh, yes.
What are you doing, you big lug?
Squeezit, help your mom!
Let go of my mother.
Hey!
Come here.
SQUEEZIT: I love you.
MOM: Shut up!
You're too much, baby.
Come on, sugar,
I got a hard-on that won't wait...
-And the ship leaves in a couple of hours.
-What do you mean, a couple of hours?
That's a sailor's life, baby.
SQUEEZIT: I love you, Mom.
I love you. I love you.
SQUEEZIT: I don't know where to begin.
CHICKEN: At the beginning.
-I have no self-respect.
-Why, Squeezit.
I have no courage. René and Frenchy are prisoners in the Sixth Dimension... and I didn't go when my help was asked to save them.
-Nobody ever helped you.
-But I don't need any help.
You know the chickens are always ready to help you any way we can...
-But as you know....
-What can chickens do?
-Precisely.
-I wish I could be brave, like Flash.
Gee whiz!
[Slurping]
[Upbeat instrumental music]
[Telephone ringing]
-Henderson here.
-Hey, Squeezit, man.
Yeah, you got to come down here right away. We're lost.
-Maybe I'll gain some self-respect.
-Frenchy and René are in great danger.
I've got nothing else to live for. I'll help.
I'll help!
[Adventurous instrumental music]
Where are you taking me? Where's René?
Where's Frenchy?
I demand an answer.
Ow! Ow!
Yoo-hoo!
Well, if it ain't the little Princess!
DEMON: Come on there, boy.
-Gee, that girl was beautiful.
-You said it, brother.
My boss is just dying to stick his fork in that there tomato.
Is your boss the leader of the Sixth Dimension?
No, that be the little Midget King.
[Eerie instrumental music]
[Eerie instrumental music intensifies]
Well, son, let me tell you
I'm so pleased to meet you
The boys and I've been expecting to greet you
As guest of honor in the house of the dead
Just relax, lay yourself down, say goodbye to your head
-Hi de hi de hi
-Hi de hi de hi
-Ho de ho de ho
-Ho de ho de ho
-Wa de wa de way de
-Wa de wa de way de
-Hi de hi de ho
-Hi de hi de ho
Please, Mr, Devil, it's not for me I'm pleading
If you help René and Frenchy
I'll give you what you're needing
If you want to bargain, then produce something real
Deliver me the Princess, boy, and you've got a deal
Deliver him the Princess, boy, and you've got a deal
Okay.
-Oh Sheep dop doop dap daydee doo
-Sheep dop doop dap daydee doo
-Skeeba de deeba de debop dee do
-Skeeba de deeba de debop dee do

-Hi de hi de ho
Congratulations, son, you really deliver
This little gal makes me shake and a-shiver
Don't think I've forgotten all the things that I've said
Don't worry about your friends, relax
Now off with his head
-Hi di hi di hi di hi di hi di
-Hi di hi di hi di hi di hi di

Be nice to me, babe, or you'll regret it
You are my hostage, and don't you forget it
The night is early and there's lots to be done
Lets boogie now
Come on, we're gonna have some fun
-Oh ho de ho de ho
-Oh ho de ho de ho
Keep an eye on the King.
And keep me posted.
He doesn't know where I've hid that French slit.
[Singing nonsensically]
He may be a little man... but he carries a big stick!
And whatever you do, Froggy... keep him away from that interrogation cell.
Oy vey, the Yiddishe Charleston

Oy, yoy, yoy, yoy, yoy
I knew you'd come to save me!
Bust Rod told me that the Queen took you here.
I had no idea that she would resort to such a thing.
Please, I beg your forgiveness.
It's all forgiven, my Fausto.
The Queen said she was gonna ream us with 20-inch cattle prods...
-And I'm still waiting.
-We must hurry now.
Bust Rod, undo her chains quickly.
I must command you to leave the Forbidden Zone at once.
This is for your own safety.
Henderson will show you the way out.
Aren't you gonna hump us one last time, Fausto?
Shut up!
When will I ever see you again, mon amour?
I cannot answer to you that right now... but somehow I feel that our destinies are intertwined.
RENÉ: Come on, Frenchy.
FAUSTO: Goodbye.
You let the French girl go?
Don't you think you'd better go get her?
-Goddamn it.
-René, René stop it!
René, help!
Somebody help me! Shit!
Let me go!
Guess what?
The Mystic Knights took the Princess as hostage... and if anything happens to René and Frenchy... she's really gonna get it.
But I helped them escape.
Yeah, but I heard a rumor that the Queen captured them all again.
Attention, all soldiers!
[Laughing loudly]
So you thought you'd get away?
Well, your little King won't be able to help you now!
-Nobody'll find you down here.
-He'll find me, I know he will.
-And he won't let you get away with this shit.
-Oh, yeah?
Well, we'll see about that.
No one can survive what this child will go through.
So take a good look, you French slit,
'cause you're next.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
ALL: Throw her in the pit!
Khomeini.
ALL: Khomeini.
Throw the French girl in.
That's not fair. It's my turn next.
My frog, you killed my frog, goddamn it!
-You killed my Froggy.
-So get another one, bitch.
You're supposed to be dead.
Uh-uh, Baby. You're dead.
I know that voice. You're the one the King keeps locked up in the pit.
This is going up your asshole as soon as I've finished with Queenie here.
Faggot.
Your buns smell like lox, honey,
I can smell them from here.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Queen Doris screaming]
Attention, all soldiers!
We have to save the French girl.
-Hurry up.
-That's what we're trying to do.
Come on, shut up. Let's go.
Hurry up. Come on.
[Upbeat instrumental music]
[Ex-queen screaming]
[Laughing]
[Rhythmic instrumental music]
Nothing can stop me now.
What are you doing?
I'm going to open her up like a can of worms.
No, our daughter is their hostage.
If you kill the girl, they will kill the Princess.
-Out of my way, or you'll be first.
-Come to your senses, darling.
You'll be killing your own daughter.
[Sobbing]
Oh, God.
Oh, beat me! Oh, kill me!
Oh, fuck that asshole!
[Prisoners grunting]
Please don't die.
Please don't die.
Life was so beautiful.
Oh, why does it feel so good to be so bad?
You...you were the only decent thing in my life.
Smile at me one last time.
Tell me how you love to...
Tell me how you love to...
I love to feel your nipples stiffen when I caress them with my finger tips.
Oh, Fausto. Faust-
[Queen Doris moaning]
[Solemn instrumental music]
[Upbeat instrumental music]
You are my Kingie
My heart's desire turned to fire with your caress
This must be heaven
I've got my Fausto
I've no doubts our lives are blessed
With all our powers
No one can stop us now
We'll conquer the planets
Then all our dreams come--
-Adenoidal doy voy
-Yes, we can hump them
-Pain is a thrill
-Yeah, sure
-I coronate the New Queen.
-La Chaim.
A toast to him as we salute the true Queen.
She really is a sight.
In death, too, there is pleasure
As dead rats, we're free to bleed
To rot, and at our leisure be eaten up by worms
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
-There's humping here forever
-Forever
And if you think you're really very clever
Just eat more cakes and pies
[Nonsensical singing]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
So really, what's the hurry? Don't worry
So maybe you got couple little troubles?
Just tell them all to me
-We're happy now together
-Forever
-The Hercules are in for stormy weather.
-No, it's really just a breeze!
And so, my friends, sit tight and some advice to you I'll lend
This drama may be over
But it's really not the end
Come with us in the land of sin and pleasure
You'll be surprised by the things that you will see
Come with us while we conquer other planets
Through time and space
The Forbidden Galaxy
The Forbidden Zone
The Forbidden Zone
The Forbidden Zone
The Forbidden Zone
The Forbidden Zone
The Forbidden Zone
Living in the Sixth Dimension things get rough
Living in the Sixth Dimension can be tough
It's so hard when you're on your own
When you're on your own
Moving in the wrong direction brings bad luck
Living without protection really sucks
It's so hard when you're on your own
You might fall into The Forbidden Zone
Going down down down how far can you go
You might fall into The Forbidden Zone
Going down down down cross the borderline
The guards look scary but the girls are pretty fine
Okay! I'm a-going down, I'm a-going down
I'm a-going down, I know
Turnin' me around, turnin' me around turnin' me around, I know ho ho
Living in the Sixth Dimension
Moving in the wrong direction
Living in the Sixth Dimension
Moving in the wrong direction
Living in the Sixth Dimension
Moving in the wrong direction
It's so hard when you're on your own
When you're on you own
The Forbidden Zone
Going down down down
How far can you go?
You might fall into The Forbidden Zone
Hey!
Okay!
Going down down down cross the borderline
The guards look scary but the girls are pretty fine
Going round round round driving me insane
Everything looks different but nothing has changed
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
