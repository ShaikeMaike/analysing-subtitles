SUBTITLES BY LUISUBS
All right, hold it!
Oh, sorry, lieutenant.
All right, it's 2 a.m. in New Orleans,
The big easy.
And we're stirring up that gumbo!
Hey, Remy!
Hey, Teeneg, where you at?
Where you been, don't you ever go home?
Only when the music stops, Cher.
Hey, who's the dead meat?
As long as you're here, let's see if you can make him.
Oh man, yeah. Hello, Freddy.
That's Freddy Angelo, wise-guy scumbag,
Works for Eddie Di Moti.
He handles Mexican imports for the family.
Mama!
Can't find any bullet hits, spent shells,
Nothing like that? very little blood.
We figure they lit him up some place else, then brought his body here.
Here's his wallet.
They just lifted the prints.
Oh-huh!
Oh, the drivers license is missing!
I guess they took it for proof of their hit.
Standard wise-guy procedure, right, Remy?
If you're gonna wrap
'em in a concrete overcoat and dump 'em in lake Pontchartrain.
But here's Freddy, dead as Kelsey's nuts, right in the middle of the Piazza D'Italia.
Now what does that tell us, huh?
Somebody is sending a message.
To the esteemed president of the Italian-American
Renaissance Association.
Vinnie "The Cannon" Di Moti.
There you go.
I want you to pick up
Vinnie "The Cannon" tomorrow morning at his barbershop and bring him in for questioning.
Hi, Remy.
Cavenaugh, where you at?
I'm doing it.
What is this, the Dodge and
De Soto Follies?
Who would know what you're thinking about?
Captain, it was Andre's idea.
Is he the brains of the partnership now?
Hey, what did they do now?
Impounded a boat.
They spent half their shift at the damned police dock.
What am I going to do with them?
Why don't we shoot 'em?
Yeah!
No, they're too much fun at Mardi Gras.
Who's that in my office?
Assistant district attorney,
Anne Osborne.
Hmmm, nice neck!
We have written orders to cooperate.
Her be part of the special task force that's investigating police corruption.
Where did she get that idea, huh?
She says she's here about the Angelo murder.
So I'm gonna get myself some real coffee, and you're going to give her whatever she needs.
She's in good hands, Cher.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Oh!
Anne, hi.
I'm Remy McSwain.
Oh!
Ouch!
Your pencil.
Lieutenant...
Ahhh, Remy.
Lieutenant, I came to find out what progress you've made on the Angelo murder.
What's your hurry, he's not even stiff yet.
He is dead though, isn't he?
Oh, last time I saw him, yeah.
You have no clues or leads?
Not so far.
See, I've seen dozens of these wise-guy jobs.
We usually find out why the hit went down or who did it,
But we never have enough to take to court.
He wasn't at the barbershop, so we picked him up at his home.
Bring him in.
Oh, thank you so much for coming in, Mr. Di Moti.
This is Miss Anne Osborne of the district attorney's office.
My lawyer is going to get me out of here in five minutes.
I got nothing to say
'til then, nothing!
Why, you're not under arrest, Mr. Di Moti.
Did McCabe give you that impression?
McCabe, I want you to apologize to Mr. Di Moti here.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Mr. Di Moti.
You're free to go any time you want, sir.
Again, we really do apologize.
Well...
We just wanted to express our sympathy about Freddy.
About who? Freddy Angelo, the guy they found floating in the fountain last night behind your office.
Yeah, he used to work for me, terrible!
Nobody's got any respect for monuments anymore.
Mr. Di Moti, isn't it true that Mr. Angelo worked for you for nearly 20 years, and was still in your employ at the time of his death?
Can I go?
You know, kid, your father would never drag me down here.
If he wanted to see me, he'd come to the house!
He knew a little something about respect.
Get out of my way!
I can't believe you were so obsequious with that man.
What does "obsequious" mean?
It means you had a high-ranking member of the Mafia in your office and you kissed his ass.
Well, let me point out a few things to you.
First of all, nobody uses the word "Mafia" anymore.
Down here we call them "wise guys."
You're not from here, are you?
I only say this to save you any kind of embarrassment.
I'll bear that in mind, lieutenant.
Anything else?
Hey, you like spicy food? why don't we have dinner?
I know this little cajun place.
Relax, Romeo.
Tell me what you learned from two minutes of ass-kissing.
Actually I learned a lot from that little interview.
Do you read minds?
No, I read people, and after seeing "The Cannon,"
I can probably tell you why
Freddy sprung a leak last night.
I suppose you know who the killer is, too.
Oh no, but I bet we find his body floating in the lake in a couple of weeks.
Then what will you do?
Nothing.
I told you we never have enough to take to court.
Hell, I'd close the case right now except for one thing.
What's that?
I'll tell you over dinner.
Hey, come on, we don't have to stand in line.
Hey!
Hey, man!
How embarrassing.
That's what's great about being a cop.
How you doing?
Hey!
All right, Willie!
Come on, we're going to work up an appetite.
Hi, Remy.
I thought we were here to discuss business.
Business and pleasure, what's wrong with that?
I can't do this.
Wait, didn't they dance where you come from?
No, we barely spoke.
This is New Orleans, doll, the big easy.
Down here dancing's a way of life, come on.
Feel the music!
Now you're getting it, that's right!
You see my grandpapa on my mama's side, now he was a real cajun.
Born and died on the bayoutish.
I thought you came from a family of Irish cops.
No, that was on my daddy's side.
He was the first one to become a cop.
Followed by three brothers, one son and four nephews.
My cousin, Terry, joined the fire department.
He's the black sheep of the family.
You were the youngest detective in the history of the N.O.P.D. to ever make lieutenant.
I had an in in the department, sugar.
Careful who you say that to.
Oh yeah, that's right, you bust cops... for a living.
I'm not embarrassed to put bad cops behind bars.
Why don't you tell me something about your life.
It's not as colorful as yours.
Oh yeah?
Do you want me to tell you why I'm not closing the Angelo case?
That's supposed to be why I'm here.
It's you.
Oh please!
No, no, it's you really.
I mean, how come an assistant district attorney in an official corruption strike force is suddenly so interested in a routine Mafia hit?
Routine "wise-guy" hit, remember?
Yeah, whatever.
What gives?
We have the jurisdiction to investigate any crime.
You got some kind of police corruption angle on this case?
No comment, lieutenant.
You got any evidence at all?
No comment, again.
Hey, Remy, how's everything?
You like that gumbo?
Remy's great aunt Emeline, she teach me my gumbo.
But she uses more sassafras filet in her gumbo.
You watch your mouth, boy, or you don't get no dessert.
We got Cajun Coush-Coush, and we got Dobas Cake.
No, nothing for me, thanks.
I have to be up very early tomorrow.
Yeah, we just gonna take the check tonight, Paul.
What you talking about, Cher?
I mean I want the check, Paul!
Remy done lost his mind.
He knows his money is no good in here. then just give me the check.
Paul, have you met Anne Osborne with the D.A.'s office?
Oh, really?
You looking for that check, Remy.
Right here it is, all the time.
You honestly don't see the harm in any of this?
No, I don't see the harm, these are the perks!
But the restaurant expects extra protection in return.
Big deal!
And expect the officer to overlook any code violations.
If all the codes were enforced in this city, you wouldn't have a single restaurant that could stay open.
So now you're defending organized corruption?
I'm not defending anything, this is New Orleans.
Folks have a certain way of doing things down here.
People like to show their appreciation.
Really, how does it work?
Do you get free suits?
Do you get a little envelope from Chef Paul every week?
Are you wearing a wire in there or something?
I'm serious.
How far does all this stuff go?
Is everything for sale?
What's it cost to beat a murder rap these days?
Is that what you think about cops?
You've got a real serious attitude problem.
Being around you for an evening hasn't improved it.
I've never seen a man break so many laws in such a short time.
It's very simple when you're out on the street.
There's "good guys" and there's "bad guys".
I suppose you're the "good guys"?
Damn right, and we're all that stands between you and them.
Why don't you just drop me off at the corner up there.
And don't think that
I'm naive, lieutenant.
I know the way the system works, but things can change.
Oh yeah, are you going to change it?
Don't you dare be amused at me.
Hey, is this your building?
No, I live up the street.
I have to get some things.
Is that okay?
I'll wait for you and drive you the rest of the way.
No thank you,
I'd rather walk.
I'll walk with you.
No. Thank you very much for a very illuminating evening.
Stop, my purse!
Ohhh!
Let's go, blood!
Help, somebody help!
Let me go, woman!
Police!
Don't screw up!
Scumbag, get your face down on the pavement right now!
You stay down there for a second.
Ah-ha, ah-ha.
You a cop?
Yes, ma'am.
Thank god you were here.
I just cashed my pay check.
Stay here and a patrolman will be by to take your statement.
You think I'm crazy or what?
I'm not taking any chances, no police!
All right.
A patrol car is going to come for you in a little while.
Now if you do anything to my car,
If you even get your fingerprints on the paint, they are going to beat the ever-living shit out of you.
Do you fully understand each and every one of these rights as I have explained them to you?
Yes, sir.
It's a good thing
I'm such a pushy guy, huh?
Hey, Remy, listen to this.
Remember Mrs. Williams who stabbed her husband last week?
We go see her, "Mrs. Williams, your husband just died,"
"and you're busted for second-degree homicide."
You know what she said?
"That bastard, I stabbed him before and he never died."
Homicide, McSwain.
Hello, lieutenant.
Hey, Anne, you must be psychic.
I was just thinking about you.
What's new on the Angelo case?
Not a thing.
Why not, aren't you working on it?
Hey, I got a poisoned nurse in the garden district and a strangled transvestite in the French Quarter.
I got a suspicious asphyxiation in town.
Freddy Angelo has to wait his turn.
I thought the Angelo case was supposed to be given priority.
When can I see a copy of your report?
I'll tell you what, the Nevelle Brothers are playing at Tipitina's tonight.
I can give it to you then.
I was thinking that we ought to keep this relationship strictly professional.
Hey, why?
I thought we passed a good time last night.
Didn't you like the music?
The music was very nice.
Didn't you like the crawfish etouffee?
The food was delicious, but look, let's just forget about last night.
There's too much possibility for conflict of interest.
Oh, really?
Why, are you investigating me?
Of course not, no.
Why don't I pick you up at 8:00, and don't be late?
No, please just have somebody send a copy of the report to my office.
Thank you, lieutenant.
Hey, Annie!
What are you doing here?
Hey, what the hell you doing?
I got a large pizza here.
Pepperoni with extra cheese.
Move your goddamned car!
You can't get around me that easy.
Where's my report?
Right here.
Where?
Under the pizza. You got to eat the pie to get to the report.
Go on, girlie, get in the car!
You write a pretty good report.
Oh, great.
Does that mean we can go to Tipitina's now?
No.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Now Angelo was shot at a downward angle.
The weapon was a Mack-10 pistol.
Are you thinking dope smugglers?
Possibly, but a lot of younger wise-guys use Mack-10 pistols, too. you found his car parked way out on Choopatalis Street.
Chopatoolis Street.
Chopatoolis.
But you couldn't find any evidence of a crime, correct?
Yeah, but what it doesn't say in there is that Freddy Angelo's car was parked across the street from a wharf warehouse owned by Carmine Tandino, a very well-known hit man in the family of our mutual friend,
Vinnie "The Cannon" Di Moti.
I'm going to check out that warehouse tomorrow.
Why isn't that in your report, lieutenant?
We're not supposed to draw conclusions, you know that.
If someone were to ask you, what conclusion would you draw?
Well, Freddy imported heroin for a living.
Carmine Tandino's warehouse is on the river.
Sometimes heroin comes up the river.
You draw your own conclusions.
What?
I'm impressed.
By what?
Well, you've obviously given this a great deal of thought.
You're doing a really thorough job.
Oh, thank you very much.
What do you think, I do a very lousy job?
No, I didn't mean that.
Why don't you like me, Anne?
I do like you.
Well, why don't you trust me then?
Huh?
You think I'm a rotten, don't-give-a-shit, dishonest, no-good, dirty cop.
Is that what you think of me?
No.
I do trust you.
I do.
Ouch!
Sorry.
I'm not very good at this.
Shhh!
I can't do this.
I'm too nervous.
I can't relax.
I'm very embarrassed.
Oh, no, don't be embarrassed.
Just relax, darling.
This is The Big Easy.
Folks have a certain way of doing things down here.
I've noticed.
Oh, stop that!
Stop what?
That.
What?
That.
What, that, or that?
Yours or mine?
Mine.
Shit.
McSwain, this better be good!
What, slow down a minute. All right, I'll be right there.
Shit!
What is it?
A triple murder in Storyville.
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.
It's okay.
I never did have much luck with sex anyway.
Your luck is about to change.
Oh boy, ooo-la-la!
How long does a murder take?
A couple of hours at least.
Come back.
You sure?
I'm sure.
We'll talk about the Angelo case.
Sure!
Oh!
Hey, Hollywood, why don't you call your mother on the phone.
She hadn't heard from you in over a week.
Hey, when the hell you going to make an honest woman of her?
She ain't going to marry me until I retire.
Yeah, that'll be the day.
What, we got a carnival going on here or what?
Hey, what the hell's going on?
There's a couple of kids spreading a rumor that the killers were in an unmarked police car.
Great, that's all we need.
Don't be looking at us
'cause you all did it!
All right to roll him over, lieutenant?
Yeah, roll away.
Whooo!
Jamaal Washington, huh?
Hey, Jack, everything under control out there?
Oh yeah, the riot's kind of turned into a party.
Oh man, I love this town.
You remember Miss Anne Osborne.
It's very nice to see you again.
Yeah, you too.
The D.A.'s office is interested since there's an allegation of police officer involvement.
You believe every rumor you hear?
Do you have any evidence one way or the other?
Right now we got two unknown white male suspects, not officers, suspects.
And one unsubstantiated rumor.
Anything on the victims yet?
Yeah.
You don't want to see this guy.
He kind of lost his face.
We have to wait for a fingerprint I.D. on him.
The third victim I think is a Nobliet brother, also narcotics and runner for Daddy Mention.
Who's Daddy Mention?
He handles the black side of narcotics.
Vinnie "The Cannon", you met him the other day, he's got the white action.
Anne.
Why don't you believe the killers were cops?
If they were cops, they would have stayed here.
When we arrived we would have found plants: guns, knives, all kinds of evidence that they resisted arrest.
Something every cop knows how to do.
Doesn't surprise me.
You probably know how to bribe a jury too, don't you?
Even though you probably never have, huh?
Hey, Remy, look what I got.
It feels like about a kilo.
That's great work,
Dodge, really great work.
Hey!
Why don't we pass it around and all put our fingerprints on it?
What's this?
Heroin, Mexican brown.
Somebody's been using shotguns here, so...
I figure Tandino.
Carmine Tandino, hit man for
Vinnie "The Cannon."
Shotguns are his signature.
Resulting in spaghetti sauce.
Captain, you want to take over here.
I think I should take Miss Osborne home.
Oh, thank you very much.
Watch your step.
Don't they make a lovely couple.
Hey, we'll go to my apartment.
It's closer, all right?
Huh?
After a while you get used to stuff like that.
You get hardened.
Everybody gets sick the first time.
Don't be embarrassed.
I'll be fine.
Let me know if you're going to throw up, I'll pull over.
I'm not going to throw up.
You think Carmine Tandino killed those men tonight, right?
Even with your head in the toilet you still want to talk business?
Yeah, I think Carmine Tandino killed those boys tonight.
Therefore, they must have murdered Freddy Angelo.
I'd say you're right again.
What does that do to your theory that the Angelo murder was a message for Vinnie
"The Cannon" to retire?
Now we know who sent it,
Daddy Mention.
Now we're dealing with something more than one wise guy killing another wise guy.
Well, we sure are.
What's that supposed to mean, huh?
Is Carmine Tandino the only person in the world who uses a shotgun to kill people?
No, but he's one of the few who turns a profit at it.
You don't think the cops had anything to do with this?
Cops don't do that sort of thing.
Not even the rad cops.
You're always accusing the cops of everything.
Okay, then how do you explain...
Hey, hey, hey,
How do you feel now, huh?
Does this stuff ever get to you?
Who me?
Bullets bounce off me.
You are never afraid?
All the time.
Look out for the gator, baby.
Ahhhh!
Oh shit, who are you?
I'm Bobbie, Remy's brother.
You scared the hell out of me!
Where did you come from?
I spent the night here on the couch.
Oh my god, excuse me.
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.
Hey, I just went down to get us some breakfast.
I'm sorry, I'm really late for a meeting.
I have to get to work.
Hey, I'll drive you down there.
It's okay, I'll take a cab.
Did you meet my brother?
Kind of.
Hey, sugar, is something wrong?
What's for breakfast?
Your ass!
Jesus Christ, Remy, you scared the shit out of me!
Don't just walk into an interrogation room without knocking, man!
Where are the Storyville witnesses?
Hi. I heard you dudes saw something last night in Storyville around the time those three guys got stovepiped.
They said you saw an unmarked police car.
What are you talking about ?
We was home watching TV.
We didn't see nothing.
Andre, take their statements, then let them go home.
You be nice to Andre.
That's "we didn't see nothing."
"We was home watching TV."
Is that right, gents?
Get me out of here!
I hate this job!
Property's a dirty job, Dewey.
You're next in line.
Remy, remember the guy who lost his face last night?
Look what the morgue guys found in his pocket.
Ah, Freddy Angelo's drivers license.
Beautiful, I knew those guys killed Freddy. All right.
And what time did he leave?
You're sure?
Bop-bop-a-do-bop-bop.
Carmine Tandino has an airtight alibi.
He was at Moscos with his wife and half his family until four a.m.
I've got 12 witnesses who corroborate his story.
You know who owns Moscos?
Carmine Tandino's nephew.
It's a very popular spot for alibis.
I'm going to talk to Carmine myself.
Remy, I got Anne Osborne on line.
Do you want me to tell her you're not here?
No, I'll take it myself.
I can tell her you're not here.
No, really, I'll take it.
Miss Osborne,
I haven't got the forensics or the ballistics report back yet, so...
I didn't call about that.
Look, Remy, I'm very sorry about this morning, about the way
I just ran out like that.
Me too.
I'm sort of confused.
Oh no, don't be confused, no.
Things like last night don't happen to me.
Me either.
Oh, please.
No, I mean it, I really do.
I know too much about your reputation to believe you.
God!
You want to get out of my office, huh?
Anne Osborne.
Look, I'm going to take you to lunch.
You look into my eyes and tell me whether you believe me or not.
No, I can't.
Oh, great, then I'm going to make us a reservation for Antoine's for one o'clock.
What did she want?
Who, Anne?
"Anne" he calls her. She's got everybody around here scared shitless, and he calls her
"Anne" for Christ's sakes!
I think that woman is using the Angelo murder as an excuse to come sniffing around our widows...
Shhh!
Widows and orphans fund.
Why don't you relax, son.
Remy's got the lady wrapped around his finger.
Which reminds me, what's the beef?
I got a call from the
Sho-bar on Bourbon Street.
There's a new owner in there.
He's having some trouble, and he wants to talk to you.
I got laryngitis.
He's got this thing about rank.
He don't talk to no sergeant or flat foot.
Hey, hey, don't you look at me, Lou.
I got to go talk to Carmine Tandino.
Oh, come on, for the widows and orphans.
It will take you five minutes.
It's on your way.
All right, dude, but you owe me one, huh? Oh!
Watch out, loose ball.
Ohhh!
Oh, you!
That's 200 bucks.
I'm looking for George Joel.
You got him.
I think your mother is calling you down there.
I heard you wanted to talk to somebody.
I wanted to see the captain.
Hey, wait a minute, please.
Come back!
I didn't mean to offend you.
I got a different cop in here every night shaking me down.
I can't stay in business like that.
You got cops in here bothering you?
Why don't you just send them to me?
Don't get me wrong,
I'll pay, one guy, once a month, not have cops jumping all over me.
Settle down, all right,
I'll take care of it.
I'll give you a number you can call anytime, okay.
I knew you were the right guy to talk to.
What's this?
It's my way of saying thanks.
You wearing a wire?
Help, help!
Hold it, freeze!
Get down!
Internal Affairs, hold it!
What's he chewing?
Spit it out!
Chew all you want, asshole.
We've got everything on video tape.
Miss Osborne, a telephone call.
Jesus, can't I leave the office for an hour?
What?
I'm sorry, what?
Step up.
Hold it, hold it.
I got to talk with this man.
Cut him loose here.
What's the special treatment?
Come on, man!
Yeah, he's a cop.
What the hell happened?
They set a trap, and I got caught.
The thing that Dodge was talking about?
That was supposed to be me.
I can handle it.
I got Lamar Parmentel to defend you.
Lamar?
I know, he's beat your brains a thousand times, but he knows what he's doing.
The guys have agreed the widows and orphans fund is paying his fees.
You want to keep your voice down, Jack, man.
Thanks.
Make room and be quiet.
Remy.
We take care of our own, remember that.
I'm going to take care of it.
I'll give you a number you can call anytime.
We got the bribery conviction locked up.
I don't know, it skirts the edge of entrapment.
If we get the wrong judge, he'll throw the case out.
Maybe he'll want to make a deal.
I don't think we should offer a deal now.
We should get a conviction, then we can offer a deal.
Anne, I want you to ask for very high bail.
Let him sweat a little.
Help, help!
All rise.
These are the custodies?
Be seated.
Okay, what have we got?
Tibido.
There are two Tibidos, your honor.
Unrelated cases.
All right, sit down, we'll get back to both of you.
You! you look familiar.
Well, I'm certainly sorry to see you before me, lieutenant.
Extortion, bribery.
Do you have counsel?
I'm his counsel, your honor.
We waive rights and plead not guilty.
We petition the court for the earliest possible date for a preliminary hearing.
Now, the 22nd is the earliest date I've got.
Your honor, everyday my client is suspended from the force does great damage to his reputation,
As well as to the on-going investigations he's conducting.
All right.
We can get you in day after tomorrow before Judge Garrison,
If that's all right with the state?
We're ready, your honor.
Your honor, giving due weight to the seriousness of the charges against a public official, the state asks for bail in the amount of $50,000.
Your honor, the defendant has been a police officer for 11 years and has very strong ties to the community.
Bail is set at $500.
All right, Tibido, Andrew.
That girl is after your ass.
Why don't you let me try to make a deal.
What kind of a deal?
Plead you guilty to unlawful acceptance of a gratuity.
Is that a misdemeanor?
A felony, you'll get maybe three months jail time.
One felony conviction and I'm off the job.
What kind of a life is that?
I'm a cop, it's all I know how to do.
Remy, Remy, they've got a video tape.
Did you ever see a jury watch a video tape?
It's like watching
Mike Wallace on "60 minutes."
Lamar, I can't go to jail.
Can I help you?
Yeah, I called about... a nickel magnet.
Yeah, I got it right here.
You're not wearing a quartz watch, are you?
What?
It's a powerful magnet.
If you're wearing a quartz watch it will ruin it.
I ain't got no time for no watch.
Good, 183.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, brother.
Hey, what's the matter?
Don't you recognize your own brother, brother?
Jesus, Remy!
You know Mardi Gras ain't till February.
What are you doing in that get up?
Oh, a little undercover work.
I thought you were suspended.
Who told you that?
Mama.
She said you were framed.
Look, this is hard as hell for me to explain to you.
You don't have to explain anything to me.
Look, I want to be honest with you.
In this particular case,
It was a setup.
But, I've been on the take in little-bitty ways since practically the first day on the job.
I know that.
Oh, yeah?
Who told you?
What do you think, I'm stupid?
Nobody had to tell me.
I know you give mama the money for my tuition.
It sure don't come out of your salary.
I'm just glad I can finally thank you.
I didn't want you to know about that.
I remember once,
I must have been about six or seven,
I was looking in daddy's pocket for a candy bar, and I found seven to eight
$10 dollar bills.
You knew about daddy?
Yeah, I knew about daddy and all the relatives.
I just...
I figured it was understood.
I didn't understand it.
What?
I didn't have any idea daddy was on the take until I was on the job myself.
Are you serious?
You were eight years old when daddy died.
I should have asked you.
It's not too late.
Want to ask me anything else?
Sex?
Drugs?
Have you been having sex?
Don't you want to introduce your mama to your lawyer, son?
Mama, this is Lamar Parmentel.
Ah, the renowned queen of the McSwain Clan.
How delightful to finally meet you in the flesh.
I know all about you, Lamar.
You're the man that got the governor acquitted.
I know you're going to to do a fine job defending my Remy.
Yeah, mama, yeah.
Of course, you know about his outstanding record and the citations they gave him?
Did he ever tell you about saving the drowning boy?
The baby was in the water.
Hey, where you at?
Who is that?
That's the prosecuting attorney, mama.
Yeah, ain't she cute?
Oh, yeah.
Oye, oye, oye, criminal district court, section 8, city of New Orleans, is now in session.
The Honorable Jim Garrison presiding.
What occurred next?
I saw George Joel hand the defendant the white envelope.
I saw it very clearly.
And what did the defendant do?
He accepted the envelope.
And from the balcony you weren't able to hear the conversation between this George Joel and the defendant, isn't that the case?
Yes, sir.
You testified there were eight
$50 bills in the envelope?
That's correct.
Can you produce this money in court?
Sir, the defendant dropped the money in the center of the crowded bar.
It was clear the people in the bar took it, but we just couldn't search everybody that was there.
Thank you.
Mr. Joel, did the defendant promise that these uniformed officers would stop harassing you?
Yeah, if I'd pay him, he would.
What would happen if you did not make this payment?
If I don't pay, the police close me down.
Oh!
Have you ever been arrested?
The prosecution stipulates the witness is currently under indictment.
I'm sure I don't have to remind the court that clergymen and bankers are seldom witnesses at criminal trials.
Is it not true that you would say anything the prosecution wanted to avoid being sent to prison?
Yeah.
Objection!
I mean no.
Sustained.
Lieutenant, you said you went to the tavern to see an informer?
Yes, ma'am.
Now if you were engaged in your duties as a police officer, why did you run away from the Internal Affairs officer?
He did not identify himself as a police officer.
I thought he was a mugger.
Were you armed?
Yes, ma'am.
And you ran away from a mugger?
I was calling for assistance, which is proper police procedure.
Was it also proper police procedure to chew and swallow the envelope that Mr. Joel gave to you?
What envelope?
Lieutenant, earlier today officer Crinky swore under oath that he saw you accept an envelope from Mr. Joel.
Were you here for that testimony?
Yes, ma'am.
Are you calling your fellow officer a liar, lieutenant?
No, I just don't know what envelope you're talking about.
The envelope Mr. Joel gave you containing eight $50 bills.
Objection, your honor.
Counsel is drawing conclusions.
Sustained.
The $50 bills you threw in the air, the envelope you ate!
Objection!
Sustained.
I have no further questions.
The witness may step down.
Your honor, tomorrow the prosecution will present a video tape that will not only corroborate every state's witness, but will refute every statement the defendant has made.
And show that in addition to the crime charged, the defendant has per jured himself before this court.
This court is adjourned until
10 o'clock tomorrow morning.
It's 3:00 in the morning.
Yes, but this is McCabe, sorry to bother you.
But somebody just blew up Carmine Tandino's warehouse,
With him in it.
No kidding!
There's another body too, nobody knows him.
Maybe you can make him.
I'll be right down.
I don't think you better come down here.
Deputy Soup is talking to the TV guys.
Film at 11:00, huh?
Meet us at the morgue in an hour.
Hey, it's a free country, isn't it?
I'll meet you at the scene in 15 minutes.
Anne Osborne.
Carmine Tandino was just killed at his warehouse down on the Third Street wharf. I thought you would want to know.
Hey, Remy.
Pssst, come here, come here.
Oh, Remy, I told you not to come.
I'm not here. Where are the bods?
This way.
It looks like the killer set a fire to destroy the bodies.
The fire explodes a drum of paint thinner, and the explosion blows out the fire.
How did you identify Tandino?
Oh, yeah, he had a glass eye, way to go!
Ain't that a beautiful shooter.
This is the guy we can't make.
He must have been hiding here when they killed Tandino.
Oh god!
Hey, I know him, that's Tandino's older brother.
I didn't know he had a brother.
Yeah, the poor guy's retarded.
The family kept him at home.
He did a little work sweeping up the warehouse.
Oh man, now they're killing retards.
Then why ain't you dead?
This is where they work up-- watch your step!
...the Mardi Gras stuff and all that.
Some of these...
Hold it.
You okay?
Who does this remind you of?
That's for the World's Fair.
They got about 10 or 12 pieces of the thing.
Let me show you this one cause when I was a kid we used...
Wait, hey!
Miss Osborne, are you sure that you want to see this?
What the hell is this man doing here?
What the hell is this man doing here?
Better yet, what are you doing here?
Yeah, what are you doing here?
I got an anonymous call.
Anne.
They ripped the heart right out of his chest.
Why would they do a thing like that?
Voodoo.
Daddy Mention.
The heroin dealer?
And voodoo priest.
That's Daddy Mention's thing.
Yeah, the heart of your enemy makes you strong.
So, what you're saying is that Daddy
Mention killed Carmine Tandino?
Supporting your theory that Tandino murdered Daddy Mention's men the other night.
What we got here is a cute little drug war.
Doesn't satisfy you, Miss Osborne?
Not particularly, no.
I'll see you in court tomorrow, McSwain.
That's a woman for you,
Jack, never satisfied.
Order in the court.
All remain seated.
What's her problem?
It seems her key piece of evidence was erased when a powerful magnet was placed beside it in the police property room.
Really?
What, the video tape?
Unusable?
New Orleans is a marvelous environment for coincidence.
Your honor, because the key piece of evidence has been suspiciously tampered with, the state is compelled to drop its charges against Lieutenant McSwain.
The defendant is ordered released and bond is vacated.
Court is adjourned.
All right!
Great job!
Lamar, Lamar.
Wonderful!
I told you I'd get him off.
Miss Osborne.
Yes.
Would you come with me, please.
What, where?
I really can't tell you right now.
Is this supposed to be a joke?
No, it's no joke, my friend.
Well, am I under arrest?
What are the charges?
Well, you were jaywalking over there, and when you ran across the bridge, that's trespassing.
And that I'm going to call resisting arrest.
You don't happen to be a relative of Remy McSwain's by any chance?
Look, Cher, listen to your uncle Solse, put your pretty face in the car.
I thought so.
Whooo!
Do these cajuns know how to throw a party or what?
Yeah.
Listen all, I want to be serious with you for a minute.
Most of you all know that a policeman's life is made up of short pay, long hours, mortal danger and very little thanks from the public which we serve.
Every once in a while, we win one.
Every once in a while justice triumphs!
Remy, come here!
I want you to raise your cup or your glass, raise your nose if you have to.
I give you the police department of the city of New Orleans.
And the fire department.
Yeah!
Okay, the fire department too.
Hey, get some of this food over here.
We done burned 10 chickens,
I don't know what all.
Come on, let's party.
Now you're adding kidnapping and false arrest to your list of crimes?
You're not under arrest.
Did Uncle Solse give you that impression?
Uncle Solse, apologize.
I'm sorry for that little misunderstanding.
I suppose now you're going to tell me I'm free to go.
You're free to go any time you want.
Where is the telephone?
Up on the porch, I'll show you.
I'll get it myself.
Oh, that pretty girl's got a mad on.
Hey, look at this.
Where is she coming from?
She got some nerve!
Hey, Anne, I thought you were great in court today.
I want to be a lawyer too.
I lost!
What the hell is she doing here?
A pushy broad, I told you.
Hey, look at this.
Yeah, she don't look bad in shorts, no.
When can you be here?
Fine.
You were saying some pretty hard things about my boy in that courtroom today.
Yes, I did.
He's a good boy.
He could be a lot better,
Mrs. McSwain.
Are you gonna help him with that?
You got your work cut out for you.
What did he do, drag you out of the bathtub, or what?
No, I was running.
Running?
Dance with me, come on dance with me.
No.
I cut a hell of a rug, you know.
Come on.
Take your hand off me.
Come on, dance with the boy.
Dance with him.
Aren't you gonna look at me?
Are you satisfied?
Are you still mad at me, huh?
You don't get it, do you?
You're a cop, you're supposed to uphold the law.
But instead you bend it and twist it and sell it. I saw you take that bribe and resist arrest and per jure yourself under oath.
Don't forget I ran a red light too.
You still think it's funny, don't you.
Why don't you face it, Remy, you're not one of the good guys anymore.
Remy, good to see you back.
Hey, dudes.
I want you to do me a favor.
Sure, Remy, anything you need.
Take me off the widows and orphans fund.
Jesus Christ, Remy, what do you mean?
I don't mean nothing, just take me off.
The widows and orphans will do just fine without me.
Hey, don't even think about it.
Remy, look at this.
What's this?
Retirement papers, you finally did it.
As of December 31, you're the ranking officer of the homicide bureau.
The fight is yours, baby.
I don't believe you.
Your mother didn't believe it either.
Are you finally gonna marry the girl?
New Year's day.
I'd be honored if you'd be my best man.
You bet I would, you little huggy bear, you.
Bye, daddy.
What's so funny?
Come here.
Dodge, De Soto, McCabe,
Foster, in my office.
Welcome back, Remy.
Foster has an interesting angle on the Freddy Angelo murder.
Second division pulled two floaters out of the canal last night.
They turned out to be mexican deep sea fisherman.
Suffering from an acute case of lead poisoning.
They worked out of Vera Cruz with long records of smuggling.
What's this got to do with Freddy Angelo?
It turns out mexican customs had a wire tap on both of these guys.
And guess who their last phone was from?
Freddy Angelo.
That's right.
We know Freddy Angelo was in Vera Cruz three days before he was killed.
Narcotics said that Freddy never dealt with anything less than 20 or 30 kilos.
That can explain a gang war.
One kilo of heroin always seemed kind of small time for all these people to get killed over.
But 20 or 30, that makes a lot more sense.
Where's the rest of it, huh?
Did anybody talk to Daddy Mention?
What is he gonna tell us?
"Come on in, fellas,"
"it's in the back under the sink."
Come on.
Hello in there.
Hey, don't!
It's not what he says, it's what you hear, Einstein.
Daddy Mention's the number one suspect in a string of murders, and you don't even talk to the guy.
We all know it's a gang war.
Daddy Mention is trying to move in on Vinnie's action.
That sounds neat, but I don't buy it no more.
Why not, it works for me.
Anne Osborne.
What the hell does she know about it?
I don't know what she knows about it, but she knows something, which is a lot more than you guys.
You haven't done shit since I've been gone.
They're doing our job for us.
One creep kills another creep, that's one less to worry about.
Why not let them wipe each other out?
Because we're the police.
We've got guns and we're supposed to be the good guys.
I'm going to talk to Daddy Mention myself.
All those dinners with Osborne and you still don't know what she knows.
Remy, you're losing your touch.
You should become a defense lawyer, my dear.
You meet more colorful people.
You're going to love Daddy Mention.
He's a doctor of roots, fruits and snoots.
You don't have any scruples at all, do you, Lamar.
Is there anybody that you wouldn't represent?
Darling, every man is entitled to the best defense money can buy.
Oh, there you are.
I thought I lost you.
Why does Daddy Mention want to see me?
Actually, it was my idea.
I thought you might be interested in what he had to say about the rash of killings we've had of late.
I know you've been looking into one or two of them.
Daddy's expecting us.
Daddy, this is the young woman I was talking about.
Well, well, well.
Anne Osborne, Daddy Mention.
How do you do, Mr. Daddy
...Mention.
Excuse my left-hand.
Are they all yours?
21 children and 14 grandchildren.
I got lost in one of those bible verses that says,
"be fruitful and multiply."
I didn't read any further.
You kids run out, Daddy's gonna talk some business.
You're a very lovely lady.
Thank you very much.
But let's get down to business, shall we.
Mr. Parmentel tells me you're looking into the murder of them Italian boys.
Carmine Tandino and Freddy Angelo, as well as Jamaal Washington and Michael and Darnel Nobliet.
All of them allegedly worked for you.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
The police are putting out this story that there is a gang war going on.
Do you believe that?
What do you believe?
My people didn't kill no Freddy
Angelo or what's his name Tandino and cut his heart out.
Then who did?
I don't know.
But I know they're killing my people too.
Why didn't you go to the police with this?
Daddy's had some unfortunate experiences talking with the police.
There's a policeman to see you, Daddy.
Give me a minute.
Thanks.
Lamar.
I didn't know you represented this sleazebag.
I only represent sleazebags, my boy.
What the hell are you doing here?
I came by to talk to "Chubby."
I don't know that he wants to talk to you.
I didn't know the two of you were like that.
There are a lot of things about me that you don't know.
Stay here!
Out here!
Daddy's been shot!
No, no!
Ahh!
What's the big secret, Anne?
And don't you bullshit me, now.
What evidence do you got on the Freddy Angelo murder, huh?
So you're beginning to think cops were involved?
Yeah.
Why?
That was an unmarked police car.
It's a piece of shit four-door.
Besides, only cops drive like that.
What do you know?
We have an eyewitness who saw two men in an unmarked police car dump Freddy Angelo's body into the Piazza D'Italia.
Why did they think it was an unmarked police car?
They saw a blue light and a radio in the front seat.
Why did you withhold this information from the police?
The police are the suspects.
Hey, get back.
Out of the street.
There isn't no gang war...
Is there?
So what are you gonna do about it?
I don't know.
The police department is my family.
These people are killers, Remy.
What do you want me to do, go undercover in my own precinct house?
No, I have a better idea.
Come on.
Anne, this is my cousin
Frank, Uncle Earnest. you remember Uncle Solse, cousin Pete.
Guys, thanks for helping out.
Uncle Solse, I want you to check everybody coming in or out, no matter who they are.
You got it, Remy.
Remy, what's going on?
Ask her.
Are you the desk sergeant on duty?
Do I look like the king of Mardi Gras?
Then this is for you.
What the hell.
Hey, captain.
There's some broad here with a search warrant.
Do you believe this shit?
Anybody who does not cooperate fully and cheerfully with this investigation will wish his mother and father never met.
Was your car damaged?
It was in the lot for two days.
What was the nature of the damage?
If you told me about this, we could have sent out invitations.
Is that car 17?
Right.
What district?
Seven.
Sorry, boys, I've got orders to pat everybody down.
Take out your weapons.
This lawyer is leading
Remy around by his nose.
Try his dick.
Higher, Solse.
Don't you touch me, you dirty old man.
Everything.
Andre's afraid of the dark.
Dark my ass, it's a jungle out there.
If that don't work,
I piss on them.
There it is, right there. No, those are junkers over there.
That baby hasn't been out of here in three months.
Not a bad shot.
Thanks.
I want this car dusted for fingerprints.
You'll find mine all over the hood.
Are you gonna come over and clean up by my house?
You're gonna pay for this, bitch.
Eat or work?
Work.
My place or yours?
Yours.
That way I can leave any time I want.
Did you find something? You look a little strange.
No, just fried oysters at 1:00 o'clock in the morning.
Why don't we just call it a night, huh.
Who are you calling?
A cab.
Why don't you just stay here.
I'll sleep on the couch.
Thanks any way.
Oh, now. Wait a minute.
You're gonna be over here first thing in the morning.
Hey, I won't try no "cha-cha," I promise.
The bed is yours, huh.
No thank you, but I'd rather go home.
Oh, Annie.
Are you gonna be pissed off at me for the rest of your life?
Maybe.
Hey, can I get you anything?
No thanks, I'll be asleep as soon as my head hits the pillow.
If I can't have you... can I have my gator?
Freeze!
What is this,
"let's scare Bobby week?"
You're gonna give me a heart attack before I'm 21.
Shhh, Anne is sleeping in the bedroom, be quiet.
And you're sleeping on the couch?
Yeah, what about it.
Where am I supposed to sleep?
I thought you college boys like sleeping on the floor.
Yeah, well, we don't.
Good morning.
Morning.
Hey Remy, is the coffee ready yet?
We're all out of coffee.
Why don't you go get some coffee.
But it's pouring.
Take my raincoat.
I don't have any money.
Here's some money for you.
I want you to take a cab to the farthest place you can find and have a nice large breakfast.
I want you to take in a movie and
I want you to give me a phone call.
Annie.
Oh.
We have to get back to work.
Absolutely.
Cha-cha, cha-cha.
What was that?
Get away from the window!
Do you see anything?
Dial "911."
Tell them shots fired at this address,
I'll meet them out on the street.
I'm a cop.
Bobby!
He's dead.
Please.
Oh, my god.
Bobby!
Hold that tight!
Where are they?
Call the hospital and tell them we're on our way!
Move over!
Oh, god.
Jack, they tried to kill my baby.
Is he gonna be all right?
I've got to talk to you, Jack.
What is it?
Nothing, mama, just police business.
Come on.
I was going over the logs last night.
Some of them have been tampered with.
Vehicle logs, patrol logs, arrest logs.
All different departments.
What's that tell you?
Only someone in command has access to the files.
So that's either me or you.
Was it you?
Who is it, Jack?
You got a wire on?
No wire. Just you and me.
Family.
You've got a friend in Mexican Customs, don't you?
You got that right.
What happened, once you found out about Freddy Angelo's heroin deal, you decided to rip him off and go into business for yourself?
It was a good idea.
We got a lot of scum off the street with very little cost to the taxpayers.
Somebody shot my brother, Jack!
They thought it was me, he was wearing my coat.
Jesus, you think I had something to do with that?
You're like my own flesh and blood.
I don't know what happened.
Somebody panicked.
Who panicked?
You've been behind this thing all the way from the beginning.
Freddy Angelo and the Mexicans.
Yeah, and Carmine Tandino and the boys in Storyville.
And Daddy Mention.
Garbage.
Where's the heroin, Jack?
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
There must be more than five million dollars worth.
It's a very big pie.
And you're entitled to a fair slice.
So why don't you take it and walk away.
You taught me a lot when I first came on the job.
What was okay, and what wasn't okay.
Is dealing heroin, okay, Jack?
Is murder okay?
I just wanted to go out a winner.
Thirty years.
Your daddy never cared anything about that.
All he wanted to do was chase the girls.
And he caught the best one.
I want to spend rest of my life with her.
You touch my mother again
I'll kill you!
You can't talk to me that way.
He's gonna be all right!
Jack.
So Kellom has an alibi for every one of the killings.
Then somebody is pulling that trigger for him.
Don't you have any idea who it is?
I've run out of ideas, Annie.
Charity Hospital, give me intensive care.
Mrs. McSwain, please.
Remy, I still can't believe it.
I can't believe it either.
He admitted it right to my face.
He was all the time so good to us, you know.
Take care of Bobby.
I'll call you later.
Bye, mama.
There's something you should know.
I had that magnet placed in the property room next to the video tape.
A guy owed me a favor.
And you promoted him.
You knew that too, huh.
Before I got promoted,
I used to be a bag man for Kellom.
Just nickel and dime stuff.
You figure it's the system.
That it's not going to make a difference if you take a few hundred here and there.
You figure you deserve a good life.
For a decent living for doing a dirty job.
You tell yourself you can be just as good a cop.
I know.
But you can't.
Wait a minute.
Maybe we should look at this another way.
How did those two Mexican smugglers end up in the industrial canal?
Came down from Lake
Pontchartrain, I guess.
How did they get there?
A fishing boat, probably.
Where's the boat?
How are we supposed to know where to find the boat?
Dodge and De Soto impounded a boat the night that Freddy
Angelo was killed.
They're the killers, those two clowns.
Hey, captain.
You're crying all over our future.
We don't have any future, boys.
Maybe you don't.
We've got a plane to catch. We've got to get rid of this shit.
Captain, just put the stuff down and get out of here.
We're dumping it.
We don't have to listen to you any more!
I'm not gonna tell you again!
Oh, shit.
Just stay here.
Ohhh!
Oh, Jack.
Hey, Remy, where are you at?
Throw the gun up on the deck.
Climb up on out of there.
We had a perfectly good situation here
And you had to screw it up on us.
You turned on us,
Remy. I didn't turn on you.
What are you talking about?
We're all family, aren't we?
Can't we work something out?
That's that old Remy.
What do you say, what's it gonna be?
Move out on the dock.
I've got to hand it to you guys, the way you handled that situation.
I mean it was genius.
Real genius.
What do you take us for?
Assholes.
You see them?
I can't see a goddamn thing.
They've got to come up for air sometime.
The bitch is over here.
Come on.
What's that?
He's on the other boat.
We got 'em now.
Next stop, Tahiti.
Andre!
Remy?
Are you all right?
Uh-huh.
Jesus Christ, it's gonna blow!
Run!
The winds are coming at you from the west at about three miles an hour.
The barometer is steady, and it looks like more of the same for your Memorial Day weekend.
Remember, if you're going to be out on the roads, folks, drive carefully.
The life you save may be mine.
Er, excuse me.
Could I have a word with Mr Long?
It won't take a minute, it's kind of important.
- Hi.
- So?
It's about Aldo, Mr Long. Alan Mercer.
Yes?
I hate to bother you again but, you see,
I think maybe you just misunderstood.
He was not very nice.
He gave an insult.
And that I do not tolerate.
Have a nice Memorial Day.
Do not work too hard.
Got off!
Aah!
Let go! Let go!
Watch my glasses, Ralph. Watch 'em.
Quiet, pipe down. My glasses!
I'm tired tonight.
C'mon. Get up there.
Lie down.
Lie down!
What'd I tell you? Leave me alone.
Ralph! Ralph.
Get back, go on.
Get back on the sofa. Ralph!
The trouble with the Knicks is that too many of the players have Madison Avenue on their minds, and too few, Madison Square Garden.
Until that changes, the most we can expect from them is nothing, John.
All right, Bill. And what can we expect from
Broadway? A new musical opened tonight, and here substituting for Terry Randall is our very own Tony, Tony Sokolow, to tell us all about it.
Tony.
The musical is called Robin.
Robin being Robin Hood.
And if you think the Knicks are incompetent, you should see these merry men.
In the great tradition of taking from the rich and giving to the poor, the producers of Robin did likewise.
They took from their rich backers and gave to the poor.
The poor in this case are the lyricist, very poor, the book writer, extremely poor, and the poorest of them all, their composer.
The cast, like the Sherwood forest, were made of solid cardboard.
The orchestra wisely stayed in the pits, where the whole show belonged.
- John.
- All right, thanks Tony.
That's our report for the night, from all of us here at Channel 5 News.
I'm John Rollin, thanks for being with us.
We'll see you again tomorrow night.
Bravo!
Not really bad at all.
Bravo. Bravo.
Er, shortly after the Hungarian uprising.
That was beautiful.
Er...
In the 1956 Olympic Games, the Hungarian water polo team defeated the Russian team.
Khrushchev sent the Hungarians a telegram:
"Congratulations on your splendid victory, stop.
"We are proud of you, stop.
"Sugar, stop. Wheat, stop. Credit, stop."
We... can't stop.
Now, every time you see me
I'm asking you for money.
- This time...
- Will be no exception.
Unfortunately, money today buys freedom.
And, as long as there are Jews who are held in bondage.
And, as long as we can do something about it, we cannot stop.
It is the irony of our time that we people without a country for so long have come to have so many countries.
Russia gave us life.
America gave us hope.
And Israel gave us a reason to live.
We are here to day to welcome
Shlomo Kuprin.
A Jew from Odessa on his way to Jerusalem through the city of New York.
His plight is ours.
His salvation is our salvation.
And there are others... waiting at this very moment.
The work must continue.
We can be disappointed if we fail.
But we'll be doomed if we don't try.
Shlomo, welcome to freedom.

There was a young woman at the concert at my parents' house.
Do you remember her?
- Huh?
- A little.
What about her?
I've never seen anyone so calm.
It's like she had one decision to make, and that she had made it.
Yeah.
I like cars.
We never took that trip across the country we talked about, did we?
There's plenty of time.
What would happen if we just went right now, huh?
You would miss your plane, and I would miss my deadline.
Would you really miss it?
I guess we'll never know.
Shame, huh, for two such smart people like you and me, never to know what it's like to run away?
Why so worried?
You've been called back before.
I just don't want to go this time.
Can't you get out of it, then?
I could, but I can't.
I wish I could.
You're keeping something from me.
A little.
You're right behind me.
- You're not supposed to be here.
- Nobody saw me.
Hey, bad day today, Daryll?
You know what it's like around here on Fridays.
Huh, yeah!
Hey, er...
- Hey, by the way.
- Yeah?
Er, did you get a...?
You get a chance to talk to Mr Long?
I tried.
His mind's made up.
He says you insulted him.
I insulted him?
Is that what he said, I insulted him?
Hey, c'mon, he flung the trash cans at my feet.
He threw them down.
The stuff spilled all over the floor.
Maybe it was an accident.
Yeah, well, maybe it was an accident that
I kicked the shit back into his office.
Slant-eyed little mother...
Well, I tell you, man, it's some country that we're living in.
Huh? Getting fired over a gook like that.
- He's a tenant, Aldo.
- Isn't that the shit?
I'm asking you, man, for two years in Vietnam we clean up, we mop up after them.
We come back to our own fucking country and they're here again.
Huh, I'm asking ya, isn't that the goddam shit?
You know what? It is.
You know what else?
It's just the way it is.
Yeah?
Well, what the hell did I shoot the Cong for?
Hey, the Cong are all right.
Least they stayed in their own country.
It's our allies from the south.
Hey, did you read the papers?
You know that the old mayor of Saigon has opened a pizza parlour in the US, huh?
Hey, a pizza parlour!
Huh? I'm askin' ya.
- Hey.
- What?
You think he's still here?
Mr Long?
Yeah. He's working late again, as usual.
- I'll talk to him again...
- No, no!
To hell with it.
I can't bring myself to apologise.
I'm not about to ask a buddy to do my dirty work. Okay?
Yeah.
"Buddy", nothin'.
Brother-in-law, huh?
Man, Linda is crazy about you.
She's some girl, huh?
Right?
- Sure.
- And our deal is still on, right?
Sure.
All right.
Right.
I have to lock up now.
Mr Long?
Oh, no!
Mr Long worked late most of the time.
Not this late, however.
When I left the building I thought...
What time was that?
One a.m., as always.
I assumed the building was empty.
You didn't hear anything?
Yeah, get the door, will ya...?
Nothing, sir.
My name is Lieutenant Black.
That should be easy to remember, huh?
Hmm.
You a vet?
Yes.
Do you know Alan Mercer?
Aldo, sure.
We met in Vietnam and we've been buddies ever since.
Both of you Marines?
No, ex-Marines.
Did you know Long when, er, you were in Vietnam?
No, but I did know of him.
Everybody did.
Erm...
Both sides thought he was working for them.
He bought and sold everything, including information.
And got paid by everybody involved.
Even the Russians were paying him to snoop on their own allies.
At least, that's how the rumour went.
I'd think if that were true you'd have a grudge a mile long.
I would think you would, too.
It wasn't just my country, was it?
Why was Aldo fired?
Erm...
Did he ever show up here after he was dismissed?
Not that I know of.
Are you working tonight?
Yeah, I expect to.
Well, you better go home and get some sleep.
Looks like you didn't sleep much last night.
It was hot.
It's gonna get hotter, they say.
Alan Mercer?
Yes.
Lieutenant Jacobs.
Lieutenant Black.
Should be pretty easy to remember.
Hi.
Hi.
Er, Lieutenant Black told me
I'm supposed to talk to reporters.
And I guess you're it.
I'm the night janitor in the building here.
We'll meet you on the north side of the building. Okay?
Now?
Great.
We're gonna film this.
You don't mind the camera, do you?
No.
- This good?
- Yeah, that's great.
You work the night shift you said?
Yeah, I'm the night...
Murphy, give me a two shot and then it gets interesting, you know.
Okay?
You're beautiful.
- Thank you.
- That's okay.
Erm...
We're here with a man who works the night shift as a maintainance supervisor...
I'm really just a janitor.
In the building where Nien Long was killed.
What's your name?
Erm, my name is Daryll Deever.
I've had this job for about two years.
It's a nice job, it's quiet.
Nobody to push me around.
I'm on my own, I like that.
Erm, I'm thirty years old,
I have a dog, a motorcycle and a pretty nice apartment.
I can do most things except dance.
I cannot dance, because of what happened to me at the prom...
Thanks for that rather lengthy introduction.
I cut it short, actually.
There's a lot more to me.
- Well, some other time, perhaps.
- How about tomorrow?
What do you know about the murder of Mr Long?
Nothing. I just found out about it.
Then why are we having this interview?
Since you asked me, I'll tell you. I have had a crush on you for about two years.
I haven't been faithful to you, but
I doubt that you've been faithful to me.
All that can change.
Cut.
- Cut.
- That it?
- Yes, unless you left something out.
- I did.
Wait a minute. Wait, wait.
Are you rolling? Okay.
- Are you ready?
- Yes
I would really like to see you again.
I would just love it.
Look, I'm really busy, and since you don't seem to know anything...
What if I did?
All right, what?
Erm...
Tell me.
Tell me.
Maybe I'll see you again.
Hey, Daryll.
Daryll!
You killed the bastard, huh Daryll?
It was you, right?
- Don't, all right.
- Somebody got him, man.
And whoever it was deserves a medal.
A medal.
It's a good thing
I was at Linda's last night.
They thought it was me, the cops.
That Mr Black one, especially.
Long is an international figure, is the FBI being called in?
Not by me.
- Do you suspect revenge...?
- No comment.
Will there be a press conference?
He was robbed. He was killed.
That's all we know.
- When are you gonna make a statement?
- This was it.
Come on, aren't you sort of glad he got it, huh?
Sort of? Just a little bit, huh?
Oh, by the way, there's a big poker game at Harry's tonight.
Think you could lend me fifty?
I'm feeling real lucky today.
I'm feeling real lucky.
Does that mean 'yes'?
- This means 'yes'.
- Yes.
- All right.
- Fifty...
I would love to see you again.
I would really love it.
Look, I'm really busy, and since you don't seem to know anything...
What if I did?
Maybe I...
I think you're right.
He's hiding something. And I know just the girl to get it out of him
Hello.
- I, er...
- Do you wanna lift?
No, no, a cab is bound to come along.
Say, your floors need buffing, or... something?
No.
I'm real good.
A pro.
First, I strip the old wax.
Then I lay down an even, smooth coat.
Then I buff it and buff it.
Gently.
Slowly.
Till it beams.
Any time.
Hmm.
I'm not much for housekeeping.
I'm a reporter.
My story comes first.
What comes second?
Mmm, that depends how good the story is.
The curse of being Irish, women just love me for my stories.
You got any free time?
- "Free"?
- Some time?
No.
Well, Thursdays.
No, I go horseback riding Thursdays.
I guess not.
Ah!
Look, we're serious.
Sports are real big, Mr Deever, they got what's called growth potential.
Yeah, but you guys don't.
What you guys got is a lot of bullshit.
- No!
- Yeah.
Look, look...
You and Daryll, you're gonna open up a sporting goods store.
What kinda bullshit is that?
You guys can't open a Christmas present.
Hey, sure we will.
I even quit my job to look for a good spot.
Yeah, OK, now all we need to do is find some money and bingo.
You got spots in your head, Aldo.
- I got spots in my head!
- All you need is money,
- what kind of bullshit is that?
- Ah, come on, Dad.
Hey, don't "come on" me, Four-eyes, huh.
If you're so smart, you got something out of that war.
Gets his eyes screwed up, and get paid for it.
Huh, all it would've taken was some form, he could now be getting his disability.
I'm not disabled, Dad. Do you mind?
I just think you're going through a phase,
Mr Deever. Male menopause is just...
- Ah, bullshit!
- Linda!
I can't take that.
I simply cannot take that kind of language anymore.
What, no dessert?
Huh?!
I don't need your help.
And I keep losing everything.
- You got the key to my place?
- Sure.
Mine was in my wallet.
I lost my wallet!
I'll give you back your keys. Calm down.
If I could calm down
I wouldn't be losing everything.
You know, I read in this book it's very Freudian when you lose stuff.
Maybe I'm going through a goddamn Freudian phase.
Oh shit, I don't know, maybe it's something stupid like a vitamin deficiency or something...
Aldo wasn't with me that night the guy got killed.
I had to talk to these cops and tell them that he was, but he wasn't.
Where was he?
I don't know.
It's just that you covered for him.
He was probably just out walking around.
Erm...
He just looks like the perfect suspect.
Aldo couldn't kill anybody.
Even in the war he didn't do it.
He's got all of this money all of a sudden, and...
He said that he won it at Harry's.
Oh, God, I hate to lie.
Man, I really hate to lie.
Yeah, I know. Me too.
Woah, hey!
Don't let it drop.
You're gonna snap that thing.
Wait, hold it, hold it. You got it?
You know, you always think the guy in the glasses did it.
And you always think the weird one's guilty.
I looked at the weird one's war record.
It's good for you out here.
Aldo was court-marshalled.
Cowardice.
The case was dropped.
They didn't want cowards in that war.
Why does a weird coward make a good suspect?
A hero's got nothing to prove.
Deever was a decorated hero.
Whoever killed Long is a hero in my book.
My son died in that war, my good son.
- You still got Bernie.
- Bernie?
Yeah, Bernie is Bernie.
At least you got one.
Hello!
It must be Thursday.
What a coincidence.
Right?
Come on!
You got me there, lady, I can't do that.
Woah.
Does this count as a real date?
No. It has to be a movie, theatre, dinner or dancing.
Oh, yes, you do everything but dance.
I could teach you.
I tried once.
The war in Vietnam was nothing compared to my first sock hop.
It took me an hour, but I finally worked up enough nerve to ask this girl,
Eleanora Zoldas, to dance.
We start. In about ten seconds she stops.
"Why did you ask me to dance if you don't know how?"
Well, I just died.
Remember how we used to "just die"?
I went outside,
I walked around for an hour.
When I got back, the dance was over, and the gymn was closed.
My shoes were inside.
It started raining.
I walked home in my socks, in the rain, cursing my life.
I get in the house, my Dad roars from the bedroom,
"So, you're finally home.
All you think about is having fun."
Watch out, he bites.
Oh, yeah?
You don't know who you're talking to.
Come here.
Wanna lie down? Wanna take a nap?
D'you wanna take a nap?
Come on, come on, come on, come on Ralph.
Hey!
You certainly have a way with horses.
Animals and kids adore me.
That just leaves the rest of the world.
You were in the building when Long was killed, weren't you?
Let's say I told you.
Let's say you did.
Okay.
What happens then?
Never can tell.
People, they say, are brought closer together by the secrets they share.
I just don't know why it's not good enough that I'm crazy about you.
I am, you know.
I've watched you, six days a week, for over six months.
I've seen more of you than I have my family.
I really like you.
Isn't that enough?
Say "yes".
It would be if I could believe you.
How can I make you believe me?
By trusting me.
Until then...
My number.
Don't you want my number?
Oh, I've got your number, Mr Deever.
You were in the building when Long was killed, weren't you?
Let's say I told you.
Let's say you did.
What happens then?
Never can tell.
People, they say, are brought closer together by the sec...
Hi, this is Tony Sokolow.
I'm out at the moment, but if you leave a message...
Er, hello, Antonia.
First things first, I miss you. Erm...
Although my job as a janitor is very satisfying, somehow it's not enough.
Let's get together. I'll tell you some things you wanna know.
I was there when it happened.
And you know what?
I'm still crazy about you.
I've been talking to your parents.
And they tell me... that you've become a specialist in murder.
First, you murder a Broadway musical, and now you're investigating a murder.
It's just a story.
Ah-ha! You're keeping something from me.
"A little."
American women never forget.
Do you feel more at home with Isreali women?
No!
No.
But I did feel more at home, at home.
It was wonderful to have a faith and cause in a world where, supposedly, neither exists.
My mother used to give me lectures like that.
Your mother loves you very much.
I love you, too.
Why?
Why?
Has anybody ever answered that question well?
Let's see that again.
...had a knife on me, y'know.
- And then, y'know, he pulls...
- I want to go from the knife to the talking head.
I think that would work better.
...had a knife. Knife's over there.
I'm not even gonna touch it 'cause, you know, the cops, maybe they need a...
It's ridiculous, you know,
I come out here to sell belts or whatever and you get assaulted like this in your own neighbourhood, you know.
I mean, I'm gonna try some other place I think,
'cause this is the second time this has happened to me in about a month. I mean,
I didn't get cut last time or anything
- but, y'know...
- He cut you? Where?
Right here, you know, it's bleeding.
Somebody'll fix it up for me...
Hello.
Hello, Daryll?
Hi.
I got your message.
Can you meet me tonight?
- Miss Sokolow?
- Yes.
We would like to talk to you.
Yes? What about?
Please, come with us.
- All we want is some information.
- What is this? Who are you?
After you answer our questions, we will answer yours.
- You sure you got the right Sokolow?
- Please.
Daryll!
Ralph, Ralph, not tonight.
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
- I'm sorry
- That's okay.
Ralph, get over there. Get over there!
- I can do that.
- I know.
But I want to.
I'm sorry.
They said they wanted some information.
Everybody wants something from somebody.
What do you want from me?
Anything you got, Antonia.
I've had apartments since I was eighteen years old, and this is the first time I've had exactly the woman I want in one of them, the very one.
Boy, am I in love.
You just come right out and say the corniest things, don't you?
Sure do. What's worse is that I mean then.
I'm afraid if I blink you might go away.
Will you?
Want some coffee?
Please.
Is that coffee to go, or to stay?
Thank you.
I hope you take it black,
'cause I don't have any milk.
Black is fine.
The luck of the Irish.
I tell you right now, it's going to be wonderful.
What do you do when you're not doing stories?
I, er...
I make up stuff.
I'll interview some fat lady with a whole bunch of kids.
A lottery winner.
Then I'll go home and think how nice it would be to be fat and sloppy and have a whole bunch of kids who adore me.
And then, I'll do a story on somebody who... devotes his whole life to helping others. And I...
I wonder... what it would be like to have a cause.
A calling.
The rich daydream, too.
You are rich, aren't you?
- Very.
- Hmm.
Hmm.
The rich always marry the rich.
Why is that?
That's the only people they know
But what if this rich lady met this real nice guy? I mean...
He's not poor, but....
What happens then?
Then the rich lady would have to decide.
I'm tired of following the schmuck around, let's get him.
We got nothin' on him.
Except that he's weird.
What are you so nervous about?
My retirement's coming up. I don't know...
I'd like to get out without killing anyone. It's on my mind.
I found a place, they got everything.
The stock, you know.
They're these old guys, they're retiring, and we get to keep the stock.
It's a nice location, and the cream deal of all times.
How much?
They said they'll carry us.
Look, we put down, like, you know, a down payment and make monthly instalments to them, right?
At only fifteen per cent.
That's great, you know, fifteen per cent.
How much is the down payment?
Fifty thousand.
And you got fifty?
Yeah, man, I told you I won big
I talked to Harry, Aldo, he say he hasn't seen you in ages.
He's lying.
- You know Harry, he lies.
- Oh, Aldo.
Hey, I told Linda about the store.
Man, she is thrilled.
That girl cannot wait to become Mrs Deever.
- Cannot wait!
- She's awfully young, Aldo.
What're you talkin' about, "young"?
Young's good, man.
Everybody wants 'em young.
What're you talkin' about?
I don't wanna marry Linda, Aldo.
That's not the point, anyway.
The point is you're in a lot of trouble.
Listen, don't tell me what the fuckin' point is.
Who you got, huh?
I suppose you got somebody else.
Is that it?
I'm asking you, man, is that it?
I was there when Long was killed, Aldo,
I saw you.
You traitor.
First, you lead her on.
Then, you lead me on.
You're not watching the ball, Aldo, you're in a lot of trouble.
You think I fucking don't know that?
I wanna know who you got.
Is it that TV woman?
Is that who you got, the old TV personality?
- I didn't tell her anything.
- You think she cares about you?
Is that what you think?
She's just using you.
You're a janitor, you asshole!
You think a woman like that is...
Oh, shit!
And after all the plans we made.
Huh, brother-in-law?
You know what your problem is?
You can't be trusted.
Goddamn you, Aldo!
Did you really kill Long?
Aldo!
Aldo, come here!
When he was a kid, Aldo must have wanted to have been a suspect when he grew up.
Don't tell anyone, but we're out of gas.
What?
Don't do that to me.
That's the second time today.
- Sorry.
- Aldo burst in here like a madman.
Do you know where he is now?
He burst in, he burst out.
He didn't say where he was going?
He never says where he's going.
Does he have any friends
I don't know about?
You're it.
He thinks you're the most wonderful, talented...
All right, all right.
Why did he come here? What did he want?
- He asked me stuff.
- What kind of stuff?
- Stuff, you know.
- Oh, stuff the stuff!
- Linda, tell me. It's important.
- Yeah, I know, I know.
But, it's hard, you know.
I don't know anything, you're telling me nothing, you know, you know.
Well, you know, he wanted to know, you know, the same old stuff, you know.
"Hey, Linda, you crazy about him?
I'm askin' ya."
Wanted to know if I love you.
So I told him.
I said...
I said, "No."
And then he got all weird, started ranting around here and everything.
Telling me it's all my fault.
Oh God, I had to say "no".
I gotta start being an honest person.
I can't marry you, Daryll.
I can't.
It's all right.
I can't marry you, either.
God, I'm really sorry,
'cause you're so nice.
But...
Oh, God, Aldo had all these plans.
You know.
I don't know.
I just don't love you.
It's all right, I don't love you either.
Oh, no, come on, you're just saying that to make me feel better.
No.
I swear, I really don't love you.
Is that really true?
I've never loved you.
I've never loved you, either.
So, you see.
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, thank God!
We don't have to be crazy about each other anymore.
Linda, I've gotta go.
If you see or hear from Aldo, tell him to stay put...
- Yeah.
- ...and call me...
- Yeah.
- ...you hear?
- Is he in a lot of trouble?
- Yes, over his head.
- What if I did?
- We didn't believe it, it's so...
Maybe I...
What's the story on this old lady getting kicked out of her building?
They came and said,
"Get out in a week, and take your things."
We're under tonight.
We need about one, one-and-a-half minutes
If the Yankees win, we'll probably run some footage on 'em.
If they lose...
Well, I'll prepare a one-and-a-half minute version and a one minute version.
Perfect.
Anything new on that Deever guy?
Zip.
The landlord came and told us...
- Are you ready?
- ...that they were demolishing...
I would love to see you again.
I would really love it.
It's like being a little girl again. The two of you talking in your own language.
It is your language, too, but you would not learn it.
I guess I used to like imagining what it was you were saying, Mother.
I imagined wonderful things.
Answer my question, Antonia.
You were with that janitor.
You spent the night with him.
I was following a story.
He knows who the killer is and...
- And did he tell you?
- No, he did not.
He's taking advantage of you.
He knows nothing.
It is dangerous this kind of work you're doing. You should stop.
Mother, you have an uncanny ability of asking me to do something I was going to do myself.
The very things I wanted to do for you out of love, you turned into commands.
Our timing has been off by split seconds.
I came here to tell you
I'm quitting my job.
I'm going to marry Joseph.
- That's wonderful news.
- Oh, Tony!
You're all we have. You must understand.
We only want what is best for you.
I want what is best for me, too, Mother.
I wish you hadn't had me followed.
That hurts.
We did not.
Then, how did you know where I was?
No!
Aldo?
What the fuck were you doing in there?
What the fuck do you think?!
What the fuck are you doing in here?
Ah, Jesus, it was habit!
I saw the machine open,
I pressed the button, it was habit.
Okay? You okay?
You coulda fucking killed me.
Coulda broken my glasses, too.
I have been looking for you everywhere.
I'm in a lot of trouble, Daryll.
I told you, damn it! Didn't I tell you?
Yeah, I thought I'd hide out here. Okay?
You know, I mean, like... See nobody'd think of looking for me here. Right?
Shit!
Daryll, I'm in a lot of trouble.
Nothing's working out.
I wanted...
You and Linda to get married.
You know, I wanted, like, a family.
A place to go at Thanksgiving and Christmas, you know.
Open the door...
"Hey, here's Aldo!"
You know, everybody glad to see me.
For once!
Yeah, but Aldo, goddammit...
You don't kill a man for that.
I didn't kill him.
Come on, Aldo, it's too late for that!
I appreciate you thinking I did.
But I didn't.
I couldn't.
Then where'd you get the money?
Loan sharks.
I got twenty-five grand from these
Italian kinda guys, y'know, from Brooklyn.
And then I got another twenty-five grand from some other Italian guys in Jersey.
And now they're after me.
Why the hell did you let me think that you'd killed Long?
I don't know.
You know.
I was always such a coward.
Everybody knows I was a coward, so...
But it's you knowing it that hurt me.
That really hurt me.
So help me God, Daryll,
I wish I had killed that bastard.
So help me, I wish I had done it.
These loan sharks, just give 'em back the money.
I bought the store.
You're giving me a migraine, Aldo.
I'm going home.
Stay here, do you understand?
Yep.
Right here.
What the hell's Aldo doing in that building?
We could get him for trespassing.
What's with you today?
Well...
Me and Julie...
We're giving up.
Gonna adopt.
Well, they say you learn to love them like your own, you know.
Yeah, I know Julie will.
I hope I do.
I'm sure you will.
Daddy.
Hi.
This looks like one of those
'there's another guy' scenes.
It is. There is.
And is he handsome, charming and rich?
Very, very and very.
Then you've nothing to worry about, this is America.
A guy like that cannot possibly lose.
And if he does, it must mean
I've got something, too.
Let's go somewhere.
All right.
I'm sorry about your friend.
You should probably call the police.
I can't.
He looked so damned guilty, he might even say he did it just... I don't know.
He's terrified of oriental people, but he lives in Chinatown just to show me.
Not tonight, Ralph!
He's still shy of you, I guess.
Coffee coming up.
Daryll!
It's all right. I told you he likes to play around like this.
Okay, okay. We will do you a show.
Come here, Ralph. Come on.
Ralph.
Ralph, stay. Stay!
What's the matter with you? Ralph?
Ralph, stay! Stay!
Stay!
There's something wrong with him.
Get the leash.
It's on the bench.
Get it!
Give it to me.
Give it to me, right here.
Come on.
Ow!
Ralph.
Ralph!
Don't get near him!
Let go of it.
What is it?
Oh, no.
- What happened?
- I don't know.
Somebody fed him some junk.
Had something in that made him crazy.
Crazy enough to wanna kill me.
What is it?
Listen.
Did you see him?
- Did you see him?
- Yes.
It was dark.
I saw enough!
Whoever that was, that's who killed Long.
Why should he want to kill you?
I don't know.
He probably thought I knew more than I did.
Whose fault is that?
If you didn't go around pretending you knew more than you did...
Only did it with you.
- I better call the police.
- No!
Ow!
What are you do...?
You're in danger, Daryll.
Can't you go away somewhere?
This is my home.
It was easier in the case of Long, he had contacts with the Russians, we channelled the money through him.
He paid off the officials and they issued exit papers to the Jews.
He wanted more money, we gave him more.
And then his demands became impossibly exorbitant.
He threatened to expose the whole operation.
He was an evil man.
Yes.
But he had his revenge, he made a murderer out of me.
He also left a vacuum.
There are six people who have committed themselves to escaping.
They're known.
I need time to get the money to the Soviet officials.
I'm the only contact they know.
I have to go there myself.
If the money doesn't reach them in two days, those six will perish.
Surely that cannot happen, Joseph.
No.
But you have to know what that means.
The... The janitor...
Saw me.
No, let's, let's call him by his name.
Daryll Deever saw me, in the building.
He has to die?
"Has to die" sounds like something he must do himself.
Fact is, I'll have to kill him.
We cannot allow that, Joseph. We cannot.
Think.
What if you and your family were over there?
I would not.
And those six, would surely not want an innocent man's blood stamped on their passports.
But how do you know that you escaped without paying such a price?
Don't plant that thought in my head,
Joseph, I beg you.
Maybe we can talk to Mr Deever.
Yes, we'll explain.
We'll give him money, anything.
There is no other way?
There is not?
This is so painful.
Well, thank God it's so painful.
I would almost prefer another war to this kind of peace.
The lines were drawn clearer then.
He is an innocent man, Joseph.
You think I could forget that if you didn't keep reminding me?
Let us talk to him, Joseph.
Let us try.
I insist.
All right.
Let's try and talk to him.
Dad.
Hey.
What the hell are you doing here?
I come to town to get laid.
It's the fourth of July.
How'd you get here?
Hitch-hiked.
Bullshit.
I swear to you, Daryll.
A couple of kids come along in a yellow VW bus.
Can we come in?
How much do you know?
He killed a man, Mother.
And he almost killed Daryll.
I used to carry you like this.
- Remember?
- No.
- I guess I was too young.
- I did, I did.
Just like...
Oh, my boy.
Don't cry, Dad.
I'm not. Why not, huh?
I didn't come here to laugh.
I came here to fucking cry.
- I thought you came to get laid.
- Me? That's a laugh.
We just want to talk to him to explain.
To ask him to forgive if he can.
And to beg him to keep silent.
I'm frightened.
Of me, Tony?
Of both of you.
- Your mother hates me.
- She doesn't.
I don't blame her.
She won't make love to me.
That's 'cause you have to get drunk every time you want to.
I gotta get drunk. I gotta get drunk!
If I'm sober I think about these!
She used to adore me.
Not 'like'.
Not 'love'. 'Adore'.
'Adore'.
Marriage counsellor says we could...
Could learn to love each other again.
And I... I ask him, "What about 'Adore'?"
And then he looks at me like he's never heard the word before in his life.
Hello.
Daryll.
Oh, Antonia.
Antonia?
My parents would like to see you.
Yeah.
Er, something like that.
Here.
Bye.
It's all set up.
I better call Joseph and tell him everything is going to be fine.
Why didn't Joseph come here?
I think he's too ashamed to look you in the eyes.
Yes?
Yes. That's excellent.
Yeah, I'm sure he'll understand.
Er, tell Tony...
Nothing.
Bye.
Hello.
- Mr Deever?
- Yeah.
- This is Tony's father.
- Oh, hi. Erm...
I'm looking forward to tonight.
I'm afraid, er,
I have conflicting appointments so it would be much more convenient if we were to meet somewhere else.
At, er, 200 West 89th Street
Pen, pen, pen.
Er, could you repeat that number just once for me, please?
200 West 89th Street.
"West 89th Street." Great.
Erm...
I guess I should warn you,
I'm really crazy about your daughter.
Thank you.
Good night.
Hey, mister, wanna buy some firecrackers?
Sure, what you got?
He just had to take off for a bit, Eunice.
I don't think that marriage counsellor's doing us a bit of good.
Any guy who sucks on a pipe the way he does...
Hold on a second.
Daryll?
- Daryll.
- Hold it, hold it. I'm coming.
It's Tony, let me in.
- Where's Daryll?
- What the hell?
He's supposed to come to my house.
Where the hell's Daryll?
He left! There, there, on the pad.
"200 West 89th Street."
Oh, my God.
Hey!
Hello, police?
I'll unclip this for you.
Okay, okay.
That was some chase, Aldo.
I never want to see that building again.
- Hey, I didn't do nothing.
- Yeah, but you did it all over the city.
We're tired of following you around, tired of waiting for you.
# Tired of you, Ald-oo #
Central to car 164.
We received a call, your suspect is at
200 West 89th, possibly armed.
Use caution.
Request any additional units if needed.
- Ten-four.
- That's us? All right!
Freeze. Police.
He seemed to be going for a gun.
Cooperative as ever, Abigail.
It's the worst play
I've ever seen.
I can't believe Sidney Bruhl wrote it.
Good evening, Mr. Bruhl.
How's it going?
You want to be alone.
The lines are trouble.
But you don't have to look your best.
Sidney? Darling?
Darling, I've been so anxious.
How's it going?
What do you mean it's a disaster?
You always think that on opening night.
Of course it's not a disaster.
They're laughing, aren't they?
Sidney?
Are they laughing?
Sweetheart ....
Sidney ....
Are they laughing at all?
My God.
Who could ever have believed it would end this way?
Who? Who?
Bruhl, you want to know who?
I'll tell you who.
My lawyer, my accountant...
My proctologist, even my goddamn wife.
She said, "You produce another crock by that putz Sidney...
"you deserve to go broke."
Even my goddamn wife!
She should know, Seymour.
It's her money.
Putz!
Listen, pal, you and me been in this business a long time, right?
Long enough to know it ain 't your opening night crowd...
That hands down the verdict.
So just relax, kid.
Count your loot, and drink your orange blossom.
Thanks, Burt.
The critics are gonna love you.
You got my promise, okay?
Here we go.
Our drama critic, Stewart Klein.
Sidney Bruhl's new play...
Which opened tonight at the music box is billed as a comedy-thriller.
So much for truth in advertising.
Well, theater lovers, there is bad news tonight.
Bad sets, bad costumes, bad direction, bad actors...
And from playwright Sidney Bruhl, a spectacularly bad play.
Sidney Bruhl's new whodunit
Murder Most Fair...
Opened tonight at the music box.
But there's no point in you folks going there...
'cause I'm gonna tell you who done it.
Sidney Bruhl done it.
And what's inexcusable is he done it in public.
They weren't real raves, Sidney, but they certainly weren't what I call bad.
I'm doing the only sensible thing.
I'm getting pissed!
And I 'll see you in Easthampton in the morning.
Westhampton.
Easthampton, Easthampton.
That'll be $52.
Every time I come in this bloody house, you scream!
Let me help you, darling.
I have been through the worst opening night of my life...
And that is no small boast.
I was called a putz by Seymour Starger...
And I had to come back home on a bloody train!
Why didn't you take a limousine?
Because I can't afford a limousine!
You can. I can, and everything I have is yours--
Don't you understand?
I want to pay for my own limousines!
Myra, I have had four bombs in a row!
And you know, they deserved to bomb, because they stank!
Murder Most Fair was total shit!
Because I'm written out.
Out!
I can no longer cut it, my darling.
Do you know what happened to me tonight?
I passed out in the train, and I came to in the terminus at Montauk.
End of the line!
Bloody symbolic.
By Christ, this has been some kind of Walpurgisnacht.
Oh, darling.
I won't let you do this to yourself.
Darling, listen to me.
Darling, you're a wonderful, wonderful writer!
You are just going through a streak of bad luck!
And to add bloody insult to injury...
This came to the theater tonight.
Tonight!
What, darling? What?
This is what.
A thriller in two acts.
One set, five characters.
A juicy murder in Act One, terror in Act Two.
An ironic and astonishing resolution, good dialogue...
Laughs in all the right places, very commercial, and easy to cast!
What's funny?
"What's funny?"
I'll tell you what's funny!
It was written by some ignorant, infant asshole...
In the seminar I gave last year at college!
Name of...
Clifford Anderson.
Listen to this. Listen to this.
Blah-blah-blah ....
"Without your guidance and inspiration .... "
Blah-blah-blah ....
"...therefore, it is only fitting...
"that you should be the first person to read it.
"If you find it .... "
Blah-blah-blah ....
"...your own great work,
I'll consider my time well-spent...
"and the fee for the seminar more than adequately rewarded."
Why, darling, that's very nice.
Touching, isn't it?
"PS!
"Please excuse the carbon copy.
The local Xerox machine is on the fritz...
"and I couldn't stand the thought of waiting a few days...
"to send my firstborn child off to its spiritual father."
Wouldn't you like to throw up?
Little son of a bitch even types well.
Wait a minute.
Not so little.
I think I remember him.
Obese.
Yes, I do remember him.
He was the glandular case that sat in the front...
And never took his piggy little eyes off me.
Darling, is it really that good?
Is it really that good?
It couldn't be, could it?
I mean, a first attempt by a total amateur?
I'll tell you how good that is.
Even a gifted director couldn't hurt it.
Myra ....
Do you realize this is the first opening night ever...
That I couldn't be with you?
Darling, I felt so bad.
Darling, I was so anxious.
I know.
I should have given more thought about you being left at home.
Myra?
Yes, darling?
Myra.
Yes?
I must be able to trust you, darling.
You cannot smoke.
You know that, don't you?
You taking your pills?
No.
Now, everything's going to be all right provided you take reasonable precautions.
Don't make me worry about you every time you're out of my sight.
Darling, I am so sorry, but I was so anxious.
That's not your job, anxiety.
Anxiety's my job, you got that?
I've got that, darling.
How does Mr. Anderson's play read when you're sober?
It's worse than I thought. It's flawless.
So ....
So maybe you should do something about it.
What I should do is beat the fat bastard on the head...
With that mace over there...
Burying him in a hole big enough to accommodate his bloat...
And then send his little masterpiece off under my own name.
-There's the best idea I've had in 10 years.
-Yes, darling, it's so unfair, isn't it?
I mean, what's the point in owning a mace if you don't use it?
Do you know what I was thinking last night?
Why don't you produce the play?
You've been involved in production for over 20 years.
You certainly know as much about it as Seymour Starger.
Darling, though I might be capable of killing Clifford Anderson...
I am not up to the criminal behavior of a Broadway producer.
I dare say not.
Have you thought about collaboration?
I don't want any help in killing Clifford Anderson.
-I want to strike the blow myself.
-Darling, seriously.
Have you thought about collaborating on the play on Deathtrap?
If it's as good as you say it is...
It wouldn't hurt if it got some of that Sidney Bruhl polish and pizzazz.
What do you think, my darling darling?
Don 't tell me that an absolute amateur wouldn 't be thrilled...
At the chance of working with you.
You mean, I sex it up a little and then split it 50-50?
And of course I 'd get top billing.
Why not?
On the basis of who you are.
You sure you don't mean who I was?
Sidney!
You were and are the author of The Murder Game...
The longest-running thriller in the history of Broadway.
God.
I hadn't realized.
You mind the failure as much as I do, don't you Myra?
I expect it was rather fun being married to that Sidney Bruhl.
Oh, well ....
Nothing recedes like success.
Darling, call him.
-Call him now. Where does he live?
-Up in Quogue.
You don't like the mace?
No, definitely not. Blood on the carpet.
The next day Helga Ten Dorp's out there, picking up psychic vibrations.
Helga Ten Dorp from Holland?
I hardly think that's likely.
I knew it!
I knew you were bored the other night at Nan's.
Darling, they never stop talking about her.
Helga Ten Dorp, she's taking the Prisky Cottage for six months.
Paul Wyman 's representing her a big book and US Promotion.
My God, Paul was impersonating her for 20 minutes the other night.
Is that what he was doing?
I thought he was finally coming out of the closet.
Anyway, about Miss Ten Dorp...
I don't think Paul's agency would handle her if she weren't genuine.
Oh, listen, Nan and Tom had her over for dinner last week.
She told Tom all about his backaches...
All about the money he lost in Silver Futures...
And all about his father's thing for tall women.
And she found a set of keys that Nan lost in 1969, darling.
They were right there under the clothes dryer.
You know, right this minute...
She's probably down there with her radar picking up your blips.
My word.
That does give one pause.
She's really fantastic.
The European police believe implicitly in her, darling.
That's half of why she's here.
She's supposed to be arresting up from pointing at murderers.
Is the larder up to another pot of tea?
Look, the same bloody key ring from both Millie and Tom.
Darling you know, I really do think that you should call Mr. Anderson.
Wait a minute.
The fat one didn't stay the full week...
And his name was Quincy ....
Something beginning with a "q".
Anderson. Anderson.
I wonder if Anderson was the one with the stammer.
My God, they all seem so dim and underdone.
Will you listen to me?
Did you hear what I said?
I think you should call Mr. Anderson.
You have not got a thing to lose.
Myra.
What?
Have I gone through everything?
Yours and mine?
Is that why you want me to phone this guy?
No, darling, it's not the money.
I'm okay, which means you're okay, dopey.
Darling, you're a writer.
All writers go through periods like this.
All you need is a change of pace. Anything.
A collaboration.
To work with someone young. Younger.
Don't you see?
By teaching Mr. Anderson, you'll get yourself started again.
Darling, really,
I think it is a god-sent opportunity.
I really do. Call him.
The mace would be quicker.
Sidney, be serious.
Sidney, what's the matter with you?
Oh, my God.
My god. You did have a bad night, didn't you?
I think that you're thinking that after last night...
You actually would kill to have another hit play.
Do you know what this play would net it's author in today's market?
Between $3 and $5 million.
And that is without the Deathtrap T-shirts.
Now, if that isn't a thinking man's motive for murder...
I don't know what is.
Hello.
Is this, Clifford Anderson?
Sidney Bruhl.
Yes, I have and I must say, in all sincerity...
This is a very promising first draft.
A trifle unsteady at the odd moment but it has all the makings.
Yes. I know that feeling so well.
I thought The Murder Game was finished the first time around...
But I gave it to someone with real theater experience.
They took it in hand and helped me revise it.
I hate to think what would've happened if I had sent it out in its original form.
Actually, it was George S. Kaufman.
Yes, but he wouldn 't take any credit, though I urged him to.
But, listen, what sort of reaction have you had from other people?
Oh, no one at all?
Well, that's very flattering.
I mean, but you must've shown it to someone.
I mean, your wife, your friends, other people at the seminar?
I see. That sounds like an ideal situation for a writer.
Yeah.
Yes, of course.
Yes, another thriller.
It's about a woman with ESP.
It's based on Helga Ten Dorp.
You know, the Dutch psychic?
She's a neighbor of ours.
It's called The Frowning Wife.
Yes, that's just a working title.
I loved Deathtrap, incidentally.
Both the title and the play.
Yes, I have...
But I mean too many to go over on the phone.
As a matter of fact, I'm free this evening.
Yes. Why don't you drive over?
It's not very far.
I tell you what, you get a train...
And I'll come and pick you up at the Easthampton station.
All right? The what?
The 7:29. That'll be fine.
And would you bring the original copy with you?
Yes.
I think it's best that we have two copies to read from.
And the carbon's a little bit hard on these weary old eyes.
Yes, we'll make that 7:29.
Yes. Well, I 'll see you then.
And, Clifford,
I may be a few minutes late...
I have some errands to run.
So wait for me by the station and I'll be along eventually.
I'll be in a brown Mercedes.
Yes. All right.
Bye-bye, then. I'll see you later.
What errands do you have to run?
I thought you said something about library books.
Picking them up, taking them back.
No, I didn't.
I don't think I did.
-I thought you did.
-I did?
The Xerox has been mended.
But he wants to wait a couple of days in case I have any small suggestions.
No one else has read it.
No one else even knows he's working on it.
He's house-sitting for a couple who are in Europe...
And he's unmarried.
His car is in the garage for repairs.
So, no one will see you picking him up.
That's right.
Why did you ask him to bring the original?
Because we need two copies.
I don't want him leaning over my shoulder all evening...
Jeering at my ring around the collar, do I?
Won't he have another carbon copy lying around somewhere?
And notes and rough drafts and outlines.
And on opening night of my dazzling triumph...
His gray-haired old mother will come tearing down the aisle screaming...
Closely followed by the Quogue and Easthampton police departments ....
Hi, Mr. Bruhl.
This is beautiful.
I frequently fantasize about high-tech, something you just hose down.
Hello.
Here we are, darling.
This is Clifford Anderson. My wife Myra.
Hi. Pleasure to meet you.
So nice of you to come, Mr. Anderson.
No, I am very proud to be asked.
Oh, boy!
Clifford whistles:
Is this the mace that was used in Murderous Child?
Yes.
And this small one here?
That's the dagger from The Murder Game.
WOW!
Be careful. It's sharp.
The prop one was substituted in the second act.
Clifford exclaiming:
In for the Kill, right?
Yes.
The train must've been late.
Was it?
No, Mr. Bruhl was. Train was on time.
I had to get some gas...
And Frank insisted on poking around under the hood for 10 minutes.
Oh, my God!
Do you know that Gunpoint is the first play that I ever saw?
I was 12 years old.
If you're trying to depress me, you're right on target.
I'm sorry.
No, really, that's how
I got hooked on thrillers.
Angel Street did it to me.
"Bella, where is that grocery bill?
"What have you done with it, you poor, wretched creature?"
I Was 15.
Sounds like an awful disease...
That's passed down from generation to generation.
Yes, it's called "thrilleritis malignus."
The fevered pursuit of the one-set, five-character moneymaker.
I'm not pursuing money, Mr. Bruhl.
I'd like some if I could have a place like this to work in...
But that isn't why that I wrote Deathtrap.
You're infected, all right.
But you're still in the early stages.
Clifford chuckles:
-Would you like a drink?
-Yes, can I have some ginger ale?
-Sidney, would you like a scotch?
-I'll have a ginger ale, too, darling.
Are these from your plays?
Good god, no.
I haven't written that many.
Friends give me things, you know, and I prowl the antique shops.
Now there's a disease.
I found that one the other day in Sag Harbor.
-18th century Burma.
-That is beautiful.
As you can see, I'm taking very good care of my spiritual child.
-Lock and key.
-I've got the original.
It's not in a binder though for the Xeroxing.
-Makes no never-mind.
-Thank you.
-I've got the first draft here, too.
-How many did you do?
Just the one. It's kind of a mess...
But I think you can decipher it.
I've cut some scenes.
I thought there was a Diane-and-Carlo scene...
I wasn't seeing before the murder.
That's right! I thought the act might run too long.
Good instinct. What do you have there?
I've got the outline, from which
I've departed considerably, though.
I made it the way that you suggested ....
Thank you.
Page per scene, loose leaf.
And I've got some notes that I've jotted down but never got to use.
Everything was in one envelope so I just grabbed it.
It's a two-hour walk to the station, so I had to leave right after we spoke.
Two hours.
To Deathtrap.
-Deathtrap.
-Deathtrap!
It'll be toasted with more than ginger ale someday...
If Sidney's right about it and I'm sure that he is.
I'll be quiet.
Darling, this is Clifford's first play and I am its first reader.
I wonder if he wouldn 't rather this discussion was just...
Between us two hacks.
Of course.
This okay?
-Don't be embarrassed to say so.
-No, I don't mind Mrs. Bruhl being here.
In fact, I like it.
Makes me feel a little less as though...
I've been summoned to the principal's office.
You're welcome to read the play too if you'd like to.
I'd like to. Thank you.
I wish you'd mentioned on the phone that you wanted Myra to read it.
I have asked you to bring another carbon.
I don't have another one, but she can read this one...
And we could pass the pages back and forth.
I can move over here next to you.
You don't have another carbon?
I just have the one.
I thought I 'd Xerox the originals--
Wait a second. I want to think.
Let me think for a moment.
Mr. Anderson, Sidney is simply bursting with creative ideas about your play.
I've never seen him so enthusiastic.
He gets so many plays...
From aspiring playwrights, supposedly ready for production...
And usually he just laughs and says the most disparaging things.
I know he could improve your play tremendously.
He could turn it into a hit that would run for years...
And make more than enough money for everyone concerned...
-Is this what you meant by "I'll be quiet"?
-I will not be quiet.
I'm gonna say something that's been on my mind for sometime.
It's wrong of you to expect Sidney...
To give you the fruit of his years of experience...
His hard-earned knowledge, without any quid pro quo...
As if that stupid seminar were still in session.
He offered--
But it's wrong of you to have made that offer Sydney...
I am the one whose feet are on the ground, whose eye is on the checkbook.
I'm gonna make a suggestion to you Sydney and it's gonna come as a big shock to you.
But I'm going to make it anyway and I want you to give it your grave, earnest and your thoughtful consideration.
Will you do that for me, Sidney?
Will you give me?
Will you promise that you'll do it for me?
Put aside the play you're working on. Yes.
Yes.
Put aside the play about Helga Ten Dorp...
And how she finds keys under clothes dryers and murderers.
Put it aside and work with Mr. Anderson on his play.
Collaborate with him.
That's the suggestion I'm making, Sidney.
That's what I think is the fair, the sensible, the rational thing to do.
Deathtrap by Clifford Anderson and Sidney Bruhl.
-Put aside The Drowning Wife?
-I thought it was "frowning."
Frowning? What sort of title is that?
The Drowning Wife.
No, Sidney, it will keep.
Sidney, people are always interested in psychics...
Who can point at someone and say,
"That man murdered that man!"
Anyway, Sidney, please, put it aside.
Please, Sidney.
Do for Mr. Anderson what
George S. Kaufman did for you.
That was a very persuasive speech, Myra...
And obviously sincerely felt.
Although, how it sounded to Clifford--
I sort of feel as though I'm on the spot here.
Yes, you are, really.
Myra has put you there.
As a matter of fact, she has put us both there.
I just thought I should bring it up now.
Right now before anything--
May I just say, first of all...
I'm overwhelmed.
I mean, I'm really honored and staggered...
That Sidney Bruhl would actually consider the ....
There I was, I was 12 years old.
I was sitting in that theater and now I'm here considering the chance--
We get the gist of the message, Clifford.
But you see, the thing is ....
Look, it's as if I went to a doctor.
One of the world's leading specialists and he recommended surgery.
Even with all my respect for his eminence, his experience...
I still want to get a second opinion, wouldn't I?
I'm sure that your ideas are terrific...
And when I hear them,
I'm probably going to say:
"Why didn't I think of doing it that way?"
But I think you're right, Mrs. Bruhl.
I don't think it would be fair for me to hear them now...
Without some sort of an understanding or arrangement.
And to be perfectly honest with you, without having heard them...
I really feel that Deathtrap is pretty good as it is.
What I ought to do, I think, is just Xerox a few copies...
And send them off to those agents that you recommended in the seminar.
And if they say it needs major rewriting...
I'll be back begging you to do what Mrs. Bruhl suggested.
We can make whatever arrangement you think is fair at that time.
Maybe the same one you had with Mr. Kaufman.
-I really hope I haven't offended you.
-Not at all.
Oh Mr. Anderson.
Please. Agents only know about contracts, not about creative--
Don't, Myra!
Like my husband.
Don't beg!
He'll think he has the wealth of the Indies...
And we're Mr. And Mrs. Long John Silver.
I would never think anything like that,
Mr. Bruhl.
I am very grateful to you for going out of your way to help me.
But the truth is I'm not really.
Myra here has just been rattling on for a moment.
The fact is, I do not wish to set aside a play...
As timely and inventive as The Drowning Wife...
In order to do wet-nurse work on something as speculative as Deathtrap.
Why don't you ....
Myra, sit down. Don't hover.
Sit down.
Do as you said. Show it to some agents...
And then, if you decide that a major rewrite is in order...
Get in touch.
Who knows, I might hit a snag.
It's happened before.
Thank you, I will.
Though, I doubt that I shall, this time.
I already have The Drowning Wife completely outlined...
And I'm halfway through it.
And I have a play ready to go next...
Based on the life of Harry Houdini.
There's been so much television stuff on Houdini.
Yes, lousy stuff.
Phony and pathetic.
In reality, Houdini 's life was extraordinarily dramatic.
He's always been an idol of mine.
These are a pair of his handcuffs.
Sidney.
He always made his own magical apparatus.
Did you know that?
Extraordinary craftsmanship. Take a look.
-Sidney.
-Sit down, Myra.
My God, Sidney, for God's sakes...
I don't even believe what you're thinking. Can I talk to you?
I must apologize for Myra's suspicions, Clifford.
But a few years back, we had a nasty experience...
With a plagiaristic playwright, whose name we will not mention.
So, now, she gets alarmed...
If I so much as tell a fellow writer what language I'm writing in.
Don't take it personally.
Have a good look at those.
They're quite remarkable.
They really seem like very solid, escape-proof cuffs.
Give them a try.
You mean put them on?
They cost me $1,300.
Let's see.
-Firmly manacled?
-Yeah, it sure seems that way.
Now turn your wrists like this.
Turn, press, pull.
No, you're not doing it right.
So it'll all be in one single moment.
Turn, press, pull.
Turn, press, pull.
I guess I'm just not Houdini.
It's okay. I have the keys here.
Somewhere.
-Don't fuss with them, you'll ruin them.
-Sorry.
Key. Where are you, little brass key?
I wonder if I put it up there somewhere.
I forgot to mention that I should be getting a phone call any minute now.
There's a girl that's coming to see me at 8:30.
It's about what time it is now, isn't it?
You see, I couldn't reach her before I took off...
So I just left her a note in the hall mirror...
Telling her where I am and giving her this number.
So she can call and find out what train I'll be taking back...
So she can pick me up at the station.
I mean, one two-hour walk a day is just about enough for me.
So I hope you find the key pretty soon...
Otherwise you'll have to hold the phone for me.
How's she going to get in to read the note?
She has a key.
You said you didn't know anyone in Quogue...
Except a few tradespeople.
No, she's from Islip.
Her name is Marietta Klenofski.
She teaches at Stoney Brook. Phys. Ed.
How did you get this number?
It's not listed.
I've had it for a long time.
See, I got it from Mrs. Beecham at the university.
I'm very friendly with her.
That's before I decided to send Deathtrap to the music box.
Beecham?
Yes, the short red-haired lady with the hearing aid.
I hope she gave you the right number because we changed it a few weeks ago.
An obscene caller was boring us...
And I don't remember notifying old Southampton College.
What number did you give Mrs. Klenofski?
I don't remember. or 324-5457?
The first one, it was 3049.
The new one.
I must have notified the university and completely forgot about it.
How strange and how untypical of me.
Could you go on looking for the key, please?
Certainly.
Sidney?
What?
My heart won't take it.
Did you take your pill?
Why are you so anxious?
You must know that I 'II find the key here somewhere.
Egads, I do believe that you two thought...
I was going to take that mace and do a Vincent Price, didn't you?
You can't write a play like that and not have a mind that envisions possibilities.
True, very true.
I'm paranoid myself.
What's your excuse,
O loyal and loving wife?
-Mr. Bruhl?
-Eleven years of tender marital relations...
And she apparently believes me capable of, well ....
There's a lesson in there somewhere, isn't there?
Here we are, Clifford, uncuff yourself.
Deathtrap is promising, but not that promising.
Good.
I think your best invention so far is the name, Marietta Klenofski.
-It's lovely. Congratulations.
-Thanks.
Mrs. Beecham's hearing aid, however, that was a bit heavy.
I hoped it was the kind of fine detail that you always told us to try for.
Are you sure this is the right key?
Egads, Houdini opened them in a milk can
10 feet under water--
Shut up, Myra.
Shut up, Myra!
Right on the rug. One point for neatness.
My darling, your heart seems to have held up quite well.
It can convalesce on the Riviera.
After the opening of Deathtrap.
We'll go to prison for life.
No, we will not.
A young would-be playwright...
Walks away from his house-sitting job.
The police won't even yawn.
Leaving his clothes and typewriter.
Why not? Who can figure kids these days, especially, would-be artists?
Maybe he realized he wasn 't going to make it...
So he ran off to preach ecology...
Or join the Reverend Moon. Who knows?
What are you going to do with him?
Bury him behind the garage.
No. In the vegetable patch. Easier digging.
Why don't you take a brandy or something, darling?
I am going to be a winner again.
I'm going to be the envy of all the people I envy.
All your dear friends are going to see you...
Living on my money.
Myra, would you mind helping me carry the body, please?
Myra, it's done.
There's no point in my getting a hernia.
Myra, come and help me carry the bloody body! Hurry up!
Take this other end.
Quickly.
Come on!
Don't drop the dead.
Come on, now.
Thank God, he wasn't the fat one.
Did you scrape your shoes off before you came in?
We're out one rug...
But I saw some lovely ones at Bloomingdale's the other day.
I've tidied up the study, darling.
All the props are back--
I have a feeling you're about to deliver a speech.
I've just been trying to understand how you could do it, Sidney...
Bearing in mind your disappointments...
Your embarrassment...
At our financial situation but I can't.
And I don't know how you're gonna be able to feel like a winner.
I mean, we both know that it's his play.
I can't understand that either.
YOU are...
Completely alien to me, Sidney.
And that just can't be since 5:00.
You must always have been very different from the man I thought you were.
I don't think the police are going to be as disinterested as you do either...
So I wouldn't want anything to happen that would embarrass you...
Or look like we're being suspicious if they came to question us.
How could they?
He disappeared in Quogue.
This is Easthampton.
By checking into his past associations.
His name and address were on the return envelope, weren't they, honey?
Anybody at the theater last night could have seen it and remembered it.
If they do come, I'll simply say that he did write to me...
Asking for a secretarial position.
He sent me his resume and I threw it away...
Which I know I shouldn't have done...
But then I've been so busy night and day writing this play.
Now which one was he?
Was he the fat one? The thin one?
Or was he this one? This one?
Yes, the one who is so interested in the Hare Krishna movement.
Sidney ....
In a month or so, if we haven't been arrested ....
Sidney!
-What?
-I want you to leave.
I want you to leave.
We'll have arguments in people's living rooms.
You can write them for us, little tiffs about money...
Or you ogling Nan Wesson.
I wish you could take the vegetable patch with you...
But since you can't, you'll buy it from me, okay?
As soon as the money starts rolling in before you go to the Riviera...
You'll buy the goddamn vegetable patch...
You'll buy the house, you'll buy the whole 9.3 acres.
We could get Buck Raymond or Maury Escher to set a fair price.
Darling, you've had such a painful--
Don't touch me!
You have been through a shocking and painful experience...
And you are not yourself.
Neither am I.
Behind all the Sidney Bruhl dialogue,
I am peeing the Sidney Bruhl pants.
I'm terrified of being caught and absolutely guilt-ridden...
About having been insane enough to do it.
I'm gonna give half the money to the New Dramatists' League.
I swear it.
Now is no time to talk about it. Anything.
I mean, in a week or so, when we 're both ourselves again...
Everything will look a lot cheerier.
You are yourself right now and so am I.
Go ahead.
"He sent me a resume, Officer."
It's Lottie and Ralph, come to yammer about the party.
It's probably Helga Ten Dorp and her famous pointing finger.
It is Lottie and Ralph. Damn them.
I've got to let them in.
Are you up to facing them?
-No. You go upstairs.
-Alone?
Jesus Christ.
Dear--
It's only me.
I am your neighbor from the House of Prisky.
Please, will you let me come in?
Hello.
Hello.
I'm Helga Ten Dorp, Mr. Bruhl.
It's most urgent I speak to you.
I called information, but that lady will not tell your number.
Please, will you let me come in?
Yes, please.
I am friend and client of Paul Wyman.
I apologize for so late I'm coming, but you will forgive...
When I makes the explaining.
You forgive my costume.
I do running morning and night.
This shines in dark.
I don't get hit by traffic, yeah.
Yeah.
There's a room with pain.
No, not kitchen, no.
Excuse me, Miss Ten Dorp.
Pain.
Pain.
Pain.
Just like I sees them.
Oh, my God.
Pain! Pain! Pain!
Neither of us--
Why keep you such pain-covered things?
Those? They're antiques and souvenirs from my plays.
-I'm a playwright.
-Ja, Sidney Bruhl.
Paul Wyman tells me.
Paul sells my book when finished.
This is my wife, Myra.
How do you do?
My dear, what gives you such pain, dear lady?
Nothing. Really.
No, something pains you.
Paul tells you of me? I am Helga Ten Dorp.
I am psychic.
-Yes, he told us. I wanted to talk to--
-I always know I feels the pain from here.
And more than pain.
Since 8:30, when begins The Merv Griffin Show.
-I'm on next week, you will watch.
-Yes, certainly.
Will you make a note of that, Myra?
Thursday night, I calls the information, but the lady will not tell me number.
I say, "It's urgent, you must tell me.
I'm Helga Ten Dorp. I'm psychic."
She says, "Guess the number."
I try, but I see only the 324, which is everybody.
Because the pain gets worse.
And more than pain.
More than pain?
Ja, something else here.
Something frightening.
No, thank you, it will interfere.
What will?
The drink you were about to offer me.
Must keep unclouded, the head.
Never drink.
-Were you going to offer her a drink?
-Yeah.
Was used many times by beautiful woman, but only pretending.
That's fantastic.
That was used every night in my play The Murder Game...
By Tallulah, a beautiful actress.
Will be used again by another woman...
Not in play, but because of play.
Because of play, another woman uses this knife.
-You must put away these things.
-Yes, I will.
In a month or so,
I'm going to sell the whole collection.
-I'm fed up with them anyway.
-Maybe too late.
Listen, my dears,
I do not enjoy to make unhappy people...
But I must speak when I see something, ja?
There's danger here.
Much danger to you and to you.
There's death in this room.
Something that invites death, that carries death.
It's a deathtrap.
And what is this in English, the deathtrap?
Yes, that's the title of my new play.
That's where you're getting it from.
There is a death in the play.
That's what you're responding to.
I work at that desk over there.
Perhaps. Perhaps not.
-It feels like real death.
-I try to be convincing.
I act everything out as I write it.
Man in boots. Young man.
Watch out for him.
Here in this room he attacks you.
-He attacks me?
-Ja, with one of those.
Comes as friend to help you, to ....
To work with you, but attacks.
Is confusion here. Young man in boots.
He sits in this chair and he talks of two people.
Smith and Colonna? No, one person.
Small, black, buns over ears. No, ribbon?
Is in your play, is such a black man, this Smith Colonna?
No, I don't know that name.
Do you know that name, darling? Colonna?
No, I don't know that name.
Remember what else I tell you.
Dagger is used again by woman because of play.
And the man in boots attacks you.
Of these two things I'm certain.
All else is confusing.
-But the pain is less now, ja?
-Ja. No, yes!
I mean, no.
I never had any pain to begin with, really.
What an extraordinary gift. I've always--
I've always been skeptical about ESP, but after this ....
Tonight, not in many years have I had such a feeling.
Like I was 20 again.
Have you always had this gift?
-Ever since childhood?
-Especially in childhood.
My parents didn't wrap
Christmas presents.
Why wasting paper?
And then later, you know, in my teen ages, walking with boys.
Such images.
Would you like that drink now?
I'd very much like to talk to you.
Thank you, you know, but I must go to house. I am very tired.
But you will come and take dinner with me sometime?
I will tell you all my life.
Is very interesting.
It make good play, but first book.
When you were a child, you lived in large house with yellow shutters. Ja?
-Yes.
-Good night.
My dear, be careful.
Right. No boots. Good night.
Good night. Remember, Thursday night.
Merv Griffin.
Would you open the window, darling?
-Why don't you take a pill?
-I don't want a pill.
I want a drink. I want a brandy.
No, I'll get it.
-Shall I bring one for you?
-Bring the bottle.
Sidney.
Sidney!
Sidney!
-There's something out there.
-What?
-There's something out there.
-Myra, now, come on.
I heard it. Sidney, don't leave me.
Don't leave me, Sidney.
Sidney, don't leave me, please.
Sidney, please.
Nothing's down there.
I heard it, Sidney. I heard it.
Myra.
I heard it.
No, Sidney.
Myra.
Sidney, I heard it.
Myra, you're coming downstairs.
Sidney.
We've got to go...
I don't want to go down.
...and get the brandy. Come on.
Look, there's nothing--
I'd rather not go.
There is nothing there.
Now, you've got to go down there once and for all and satisfy me.
No!
Then satisfy yourself.
There is nothing down there.
There is something.
It's just the wind.
It's just the wind.
And it's blowing the leaves.
Sidney, I don't want to do this.
-Blowing the leaves against the windows.
-It's right here. I heard it.
Listen, love, you're overwrought and no wonder in the condition you're in.
-Come on, now.
-I don't want to do this.
I cannot let you do this--
Honey, I'm not gonna look.
You've got to look.
Look.
Nothing there.
See, it's nothing.
Let's have that drink.
It wasn't locked.
That's hardly surprising, everything considered.
I suggest you sip this one.
Thank you.
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.
Sidney.
What? What is it?
I have to say something.
-Sidney.
-Yeah.
Part of me tonight .... Sidney.
Some terrible, unknown part of me ....
Oh, God.
...was hoping that you would do it.
At the same time that I was terrified that you would...
Part of me was really hoping.
Yeah, I saw your money.
I saw the name and ....
You tried to stop me.
-I did?
-Yes, you did your best.
Now, darling...
This was my doing and my doing alone.
Do you understand?
If anything goes wrong...
I don't want any confusion on that point, none whatsoever, darling.
None at all.
But nothing will go wrong. I promise you.
Just believe in me, Myra.
Please, believe in me.
I believe you.
Do you think it's possible...
That murder is an aphrodisiac?
Up we go.
Look at that moon.
Isn't that moon beautiful?
Isn't it beautiful?
Open the window, darling.
Listen, all I did was help carry you.
Myra gasping and choking:
It worked. She's dead.
Yes, of course.
She's had minor heart attacks over much less.
For future reference, Clifford, that Styrofoam log hurts.
Sorry.
You did it much harder than you did in the motel room.
What about that Helga Ten Dorp lady?
I almost had a heart attack out there myself, when she says I was going to attack you.
God.
"Ja, is a very confusing image."
Thank god for that.
Perhaps it's a good job she came.
Now she'll be telling everybody...
That she felt the physical pain of the oncoming attack.
Every little bit helps.
I've been telling people for days that Myra was a bit under the weather.
Oh, Christ.
If only that goddamned lousy production had worked...
Even halfway...
I'd have a movie sale.
There would have been enough.
We could have just taken off.
It didn't work, Sidney.
And you knew it wasn't going to from the second week of rehearsal.
I didn't want to kill her.
I didn't.
This is not exactly what they call involuntary homicide.
Let me get my things.
There's no hurry.
I'm going to wait a few minutes before I call the ambulance.
Also, we don't want anyone working miracles of resuscitation, do we?
Come and clean yourself up and give me a hand.
What if that Madame Ten Dorp comes back?
I don't see why she should.
The pain has stopped, hasn't it?
Cripes!
Why you burning it?
There's nothing incriminating.
Still, I'll say I was getting rid of manuscripts as the grim reaper struck.
-Closer you stay to the truth, the better.
-Farewell, Deathtrap.
Would that you were the genuine article.
I really am going to try something on ESP.
That was an impressive demonstration the lady gave...
Despite the mistakes.
I'm gonna make the call, so you go and get your things.
-How long you think it's gonna be?
-At least two hours.
I may have to go with her. I don't know.
-Ciao.
-Ciao.
The floorboards upstairs creak, so do a quick wash up...
Get into bed and stay there.
I'll buy that.
Hello? This is Sidney Bruhl.
I'm at 10, Hookpont Lane.
Could you please send an ambulance as quickly as possible?
My wife has had a coronary.
Please, come immediately.
Thank you. Goodbye.
Accept the soul of our sister...
Myra Elizabeth Maxwell Bruhl...
In the name of the Father and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen.
That must have been quite a welfare office.
It was.
You know, everybody had a really poignant story.
They're creating the play, really.
Just doing it for me.
-It just writes itself up.
-Yeah, that's right.
-No notes? No outlines?
-You know, this isn't a thriller, Sidney.
It's not dependent on intricate plotting and contrived theatrics.
I mean, see, these are real people.
I'm only bringing them on...
Letting them pour out their dreams and frustrations...
Like the clerks, with their pettiness and frustration...
And the clients with their bitterness and their battered self-esteem.
I really lost interest in thrillers.
What I'm doing here is relevant.
Even though you said that word...
I am still going to let you stay here.
-Let me see a few pages.
-I'd rather wait till the whole thing's done.
I'll give it to you in one glorious bundle.
Do you mind?
Of course, what's another half-hour?
Nothing doing?
Why don't you have Helga Ten Dorp over?
Maybe talking with her might spark something.
You do like to live dangerously, don't you?
No way.
I do not want her on the premises.
Never again, thank you.
Maybe not when the moon is full, but any other time, why not?
Look at the egg she laid on the Griffin Show. Pathetic.
Yes. She was pretty rattled.
I'll go.
We don't want to break the flow, do we, dear?
Porter.
How are you, Sidney?
I'm not too bad, thanks.
There are a couple of things.
I had to be in the area and I just decided to take a chance.
Thank you.
You feel up to a few papers?
I'd be glad of the break.
Would you like some coffee?
Of course I would.
This is Clifford Anderson, my secretary. My friend, Porter Milgrim.
-How do you do, sir?
-How do you do?
I would say my attorney, but he'd bill me.
I'm going to bill you anyway.
It's a business call.
Look at that. Isn't that a beauty?
Partner's desk.
-Where did you find it?
-I happened on it last week.
Makes more sense than cluttering up the place with two single ones.
And it is deductible, Porter.
Well, shouldn't I go get the groceries now?
And you and Mr. Milgrim can talk in private.
-Would you mind?
-No. I have to do it sometime.
Wait a second, Porter. Hold on, Clifford.
Take your time, Sidney.
I haven 't started the clock yet.
I like this room. It has character.
It's a pleasure to be working here.
He's looking well.
Just in the last few days, really.
You know, it was pretty bad last week.
He was crying every night.
You could hear him through the walls.
He was drinking, too.
But he'll be all right.
His work's a great solace to him.
$20 do it?
It should. We just need salad things, milk, paper napkins.
I'm going to Gibson's.
Got the keys to the car?
And yogurt. Any flavor but prune.
It's nice meeting you, or see you later.
Whichever it turns out to be.
Pleasant young fellow. Good-looking, too.
I guess.
Do you think he's gay?
Didn't strike me that way.
I have a sneaking suspicion he might be.
So long as he does his job and doesn't fly on little fairy wings into my chamber...
I suppose it's none of my business.
Besides, how people would talk if I 'd taken on a female secretary.
If she were under 80.
That's why I called Clifford.
Good to see you looking so well, Sidney.
That's the main reason I've come.
I was delegated by the Wesson's and the Harvey's.
That young man's been discouraging all callers...
And we were afraid you might be in worse shape than he was letting on.
Obviously that's not the case.
No, but I'm not up to socializing yet.
But I am coming through.
The work is a great solace.
That's what he said.
Bring that damn thing out on the porch.
Let's deal with it in the sunlight.
Right.
And the next item on the agenda is your will.
Now that Myra 's gone, you ought to look it over.
As it stands, if anything should happen to you...
Your cousins will inherit.
You want to leave it that way?
-I'll deal with it later. You hang on to it.
-Don't put it off.
This is the third item.
This is only approximately, because I don't have up-to-date appraisal...
On the real estate yet.
But this is what you can anticipate, roughly...
Give or take a few thousand dollars.
I had no idea there was this much.
Well, old man, you've gotten off cheap.
Yes, I'm aware of that.
What's the procedure?
You dictate and he types?
No, I type the first draft and then he types.
And types and types.
He also does the letters.
That what he was doing before, letters?
No. He's trying to write his own play.
The seminar, of course.
Yes, he started yesterday.
Will probably finish tomorrow.
I hope he's not stealing your ESP idea.
Have you discussed it with him?
What in the world makes you say that?
Whatever he was working on, he locked it up in this drawer.
Unobtrusively, but I noticed it.
No, not unobtrusively. Slyly.
Then again, maybe he was afraid you'd steal his idea.
The dreams and frustrations of welfare workers?
-He worked in a welfare office?
-That's where he was before.
Then it was only force of habit.
People in large offices often lock their desks.
I'm sorry if I worried you, Sidney.
The suspicious legal mind.
He's probably exactly what he seems:
An honest and helpful young man.
-Completely trustworthy.
-No doubt.
That check from the insurance company, has it come yet?
NO.
It's something you'd rather not do yourself.
Would you like me to get after them?
Would you mind?
I'll write them first in the morning.
-I'd appreciate that.
-When'll you come to town to have dinner?
In a week or two,
I'll be ready to face the world again.
Good.
Good bye, Porter.
I'm proud of you, Sidney.
Shit!
Bloody old-world craftsmen.
Where have you been?
Gibson's.
Then I stopped by the jeans shop.
Got mauled by that bitch, Nan Wesson.
She thinks I'm standing between you two.
So you are, luv.
I'll put away.
I'll do it.
No. You shopped. I'll put away.
I know you want to get back to your welfare office.
Only literarily.
Change is in the bowl.
Cliff, can you come in here a sec?
Where are you?
What's going on?
Hello?
-Where the hell were you?
-Where the hell were you?
I thought you hadn't heard me.
So I ambled around through the dappled day.
I thought you might like one of these.
I had a sudden craving as in the commercials.
So...
You've lost your interest in thrillers?
No taste for the intricate plotting, the two-dimensional characters.
You want to do something real and meaningful...
Socially relevant.
Give me a break, will you?
Your idea will start coming in a minute.
Deathtrap.
"A thriller in two acts by Clifford Anderson.
"Characters: Julian Crane, a playwright.
"Doris Crane, his wife.
"Victor Madison, Crane's protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ©.
"Inga Van Bronk, a psychic.
"The action takes place in Julian Crane's study...
"in the Crane home in Easthampton, New York."
-How the hell did you--
-"Stage left!
"A brick fireplace. Practical to the extent that paper can be burned in it.
"Center stage, French doors, a post-colonial modification...
"opening out to a shrubbery-flanked patio.
"The room is decorated with a collection of antique weapons and shackles. "
A nice selection of which
I'm about to use any minute, Clifford!
-Would you like me to explain?
-That you're a lunatic with a death wish?
I've got the same wish you have.
A success wish!
This is not going to bring you success!
This, you asshole, is going to bring you
20 to life in maximum security!
Listen to me. Come on.
It hit me that night when you were looking for the key...
This can make a terrific thriller.
-It will make a terrific thriller.
-In which someone like me and like you...
Gives someone like Myra a fatal heart attack?
Absolutely right. At the end of act one.
Clifford, I hate to ask this...
But could you give me your own special definition of success?
Being gangbanged in a shower in the state penitentiary?
-I knew you'd have reservations about it.
-Reservations?
I'm standing here petrified, stupefied, and horrified!
-How's that for bloody reservations?
-Come on, Sidney, listen.
There is no way for anybody to prove what did or did not cause Myra...
To have a heart attack.
A playwright, a writer of thrillers...
-and living in Long Island!
-Sidney, come on, baby.
If I could change things, I would, but I can't.
Look, it's got to be a playwright.
Who else can pretend to receive a finished work that can make lots of money?
A composer, a novelist ....
Why am I discussing this?
Check. A surefire, smash-hit symphony.
Does a novelist or a composer know where to get a chain that squirts blood...
Or how to stage a convincing murder?
It has to be a playwright who writes thrillers...
Because Arthur Miller probably has old sample cases hanging on his wall.
I can make it Bridgehampton, not Easthampton.
Why make it anywhere? Why make it?
-Because it's there, Sidney.
-That's mountains, not plays!
Plays aren't there until some asshole writes them!
Come on.
Hey, come on.
It's all right. Just sit down.
It's all right.
Listen to me.
Think for a minute, all right?
Just think about everything that happened that night.
Ll try to see it from an audience's point of view.
Everything that we did to convince Myra that she was seeing a real murder...
Would have exactly the same effect on an audience, wouldn't it?
Didn't we write a play, rehearse it?
Didn't we plan it? Didn't we execute it?
Wasn't she the audience?
We did it! And it worked.
It worked perfectly, and nobody can prove what really happened here. Nobody!
What are you going to say to the men from the Times...
When they ask you:
"Didn't you work for Sidney Bruhl?
"And didn't his wife have a heart attack at about the same time you came here?"
No comment.
I have a comment.
No! Absolutely and definitely no!
I have a name and a reputation.
Somewhat tattered, perhaps...
But still good for dinner invitations and summer seminars.
I wish to live out my years as the man who wrote The Murder Game...
Not as the faggot who knocked off his wife.
Why, look! A brick fireplace!
I wonder if it is practical to the extent that paper can burn in it.
Stop right where you are, fella.
You burn that and I'll go right out of here and write it someplace else.
Now, you give it to me.
Give it to me!
Thank you.
You know, we really...
Really shouldn't get angry with each other. That's not what I want.
Of course not.
Let's talk about exactly what it is you do want.
Certainly.
I want a shortcut, Sidney...
And I don't give a shit whose property it cuts through, if you understand me.
You think that, that play, that wild concoction of--
Of truth, of fact.
Clifford, my dear, those facts are the most outlandish and preposterous--
Set of circumstances entertaining enough...
To persuade an audience to suspend it's disbelief.
Opening lecture.
You're an excellent student, Clifford.
Student...
Companion...
Lover...
Collaborator.
We're going to write Deathtrap, Sidney.
You and me.
I t 's perfect.
What do you care if the publicity gets a little sticky?
Come on, don't be such an old nellie.
Just look around you! Jesus Christ.
You don't have to read Hustler.
Just read Village Voice, People Magazine...
Sidney, I'll tell you something.
Everything that you have ever thought of and a hell of a lot that you haven't...
Is in print and on the screen.
I mean, babe, it is a tidal wave.
All the news is fit to print and show.
Sidney, nobody gives a shit who did what or who they did it to.
All they want is to be in on it.
I mean, you killed your wife? That's okay.
Why don't you abuse your kids, poison the well, fuck bats?
As long as you get on television, talk about it afterwards.
You know I'm right, don't you?
Sidney, you ever hear of somebody turning down a party...
Where they think they can meet Nixon or Vesco...
Or any one of those big guys who got away with it?
Now, listen.
I've given this a lot of serious thought...
And I really think if there's some talk about us...
And about Myra, it can help the play.
Well ....
You really have given it some thought, haven't you?
Who knows? You may be right, but ....
But, what?
Let's be honest, Clifford, and I mean really honest.
If you had the choice between turning out just a hit play...
And turning out a hit play with dangerous origins...
You'd choose the latter, right?
Clever old Sid.
Now, level with me, luv.
Those little brushes with the authorities...
In your infancy, as it were...
Before you matured and settled down, so to speak...
Did any of the courts...
Or the social workers and the shrinks...
Did anybody ever use the word ....
What word, luv?
Sociopath.
Isn't that what it's called?
That's what it's called.
Does that word frighten you, Sidney?
No, it doesn't frighten me.
It does, however...
Give me pause.
Clinically, it means, as I'm sure you know...
It means one who has no sense of moral obligation whatsoever.
Now, ii and I repeat, if...
I decide to kick over the traces and actually write Deathtrap ....
-With me?
-Yes, of course, with you.
If I decided to enter into such a risky and exciting collaboration...
I wonder if ....
If, what?
I wonder if it would not be just a trifle starry-eyed of me...
To contemplate a partnership...
Where I could count on no sense of moral obligation whatsoever.
Are you trying to say that you don't think that you can trust me?
How clearly you put it.
That's up to you, Sidney.
But you can trust me.
You can always trust me.
Well, you'll have to be sure about one another thing.
And that is?
You just have to be sure that whatever happens, I need you.
For instance...
Like I need you now.
-Would you count the ways?
-Sure.
One: It's a little academic, perhaps, but nevertheless, I know that...
Scene one is still coming out a little stilted and heavy-handed.
Of course, I could help you fix that.
Then do it.
God knows I could do with half the royalties...
Of a good, solid hit.
Porter just gave me the figures of Myra's estate.
It was a bit of a shock.
Even smaller than I thought.
A lousy $42,000.
There 's the house and land, but I can't sell any acreage...
Until the will goes through probate...
And he says that will take nearly two years.
You're not going to live long on that much.
-What about the insurance?
-Minimal.
My offer's open, Sidney.
I'll do it!
They can Wag their damn tongues off.
I'll blush all the way to the bank.
You mean it?
Ta-da!
-Bruhl and Anderson.
-Bruhl and Anderson.
We'll make it Bridgehampton, not Easthampton.
What the hell, who cares?
God, I don't believe it. Me,
Clifford Anderson, actually collaborating...
With Sidney Bruhl!
Don't kid a kidder, Cliff.
That's from Act One.
Here you go.
Happy New Year.
Deathtrap.
Deathtrap.
Listen, I think we may have a problem with Act Two, 'cause ....
How so?
We've got a murder in the first act, two murders, actually.
-I think that Act Two might be a letdown.
-Not necessarily.
Maybe we should bring in a fifth character, a detective, a Long Island version...
-of the one they had in Dial M.
-Inspector Hubbard.
I think the dame Inga Van Bronk should come in again.
Good. Now go on drafting Act One, and let me do the thinking about Act Two.
It's Helga. It's only Helga, Mr. Bruhl.
You're not Mr. Bruhl!
Mr. Bruhl isn't here.
Is very wet.
Sorry. Why don't you come in?
Okay.
Mr. Bruhl will be back in a minute.
-You are ....
-I'm Clifford Anderson. I'm his secretary.
I'm Helga Ten Dorp.
I'm psychic.
Yes, I know.
Mr. Bruhl told me about you.
He said you were actually able to predict his wife 's death.
Ja, was much pain right here.
Very sad. Such a nice lady.
This room.
He is well, Mr. Bruhl?
Yes, he's just fine.
He's gone out to dinner for the first time since ....
He'd be back by 10:00.
Should be about that now.
It will be big storm. Much wind and rain, lightning and thunder.
-Again trees will fall.
-Are you sure?
Ja, was on radio.
I come to borrow candles.
Are none in cottage.
You have?
I'm sure he must have some.
Why don't you sit down, ma'am?
Thank you.
Boots?
You wear boots?
Yes, Practically everybody does.
They're very comfortable.
You are for long time secretary to Mr. Bruhl?
No. Actually I came here about three weeks ago after his wife died.
Excuse me.
Mr. Bruhl.
Bloody bore Porter is.
Glad you're back. Miss Ten Dorp is here.
Helga, how nice to see you.
How good you get home before storm.
Miss Ten Dorp says it's a bad one.
She needs some candles. Do we have any?
Yes, there's some upstairs.
I saw you on The Merv Griffin Show.
It wasn't a very good night, was it?
What is it?
This is the man I warn you of.
Man in boots who attacks you.
Warn me? Oh, yes.
In the turmoil of Myra's death--
Is he.
Candles are not why I come.
I have many candles.
But again tonight,
I feel danger here in this room.
The feeling, very strong.
You should not have him here.
This is weird. This is absolutely amazing.
Do you know,
I decided just tonight to dismiss him?
I was discussing this with my lawyer.
Now, I felt uneasy about him last week...
And I asked my lawyer to check on him.
Smith Corona?
-Is his?
-Why, yes.
Corona, not Colonna.
-You must send away this man at once.
-I was going to.
Give him his notice, at least.
I won't put it off since you've warned me.
But tell me, are you positive...
That you saw him attacking me?
Very sharp, very clear. Like TV with cable.
Thank you. Ja, I take two.
There's plenty more.
Two is enough.
It's really blowing up out there.
Ja, sometimes they get it right, these weathermen.
-You want I should stay?
-No, there's no need.
-You're going to get very wet out there.
-I'm not afraid of rain.
-Good night.
-It was very nice meeting you.
She told you
I'm man in boots who attacks you, ja?
She noticed them just before you came in.
I told her you were teaching me karate...
And we were attacking each other all over the place.
The closer you stick to the truth, the better.
Old bat.
-I finished Act One.
-Your evening was better spent than mine.
I've ended it with Julian on the phone.
"God, how can I go on without her?"
Yeah, he wants the doctor to think he's upset.
The dialogue's a bit Tin Pan Alley but your timing's good.
I've got Act Two ready to go.
Terrific.
At least I think I have.
There are two bits of business
I'm not sure will work.
We'll try them, and if they do, we'll go through the whole thing scene by scene.
-It's really full of surprises.
-Let's hear them.
Shit, I'm fed up with this weather.
Cliff, check the upstairs windows, will you?
Just made it.
It's really going to be a bitch.
So, what's the bits, the business?
-They're in the final scene.
-Yeah?
Victor has spilled the beans...
And our detective has come to beard Julian in his den. Right?
Julian goes berserk, shoots the detective in the left arm.
-Left.
-But there's only one bullet in the gun.
I'll explain that later.
He's got to get to the upstage wall...
Grab a weapon, and finish him off.
Now, the first question is:
Can a one-armed inspector in very good physical condition...
Stop a two-armed, middle-aged playwright?
And the answer has to be no.
So let's try it.
Me Julian, you detective.
Right over here.
Why?
Don't you remember the seminar?
When in doubt, physicalize.
-Come on.
-Okay.
All right, so my left arm is out of commission.
You ready? Go!
Voilà. It works.
I scratched your neck.
I'll survive.
Now, the next bit is less strenuous and very brief
Glad to hear it.
Come up here.
Now I'm the detective and you're Julian.
Okay.
Right.
Now take the ax off the wall.
This one?
Yeah.
Okay.
No, it doesn't look natural that way.
It feels natural this way.
-Try it the other way.
-The other way.
No, it really doesn't feel natural this way.
All right.
Put it back the way you had it, then.
-Yeah, feels better this way.
-Good.
I'll tell you what, Cliff, put the ax down on the floor.
Stand very still, Clifford.
We're going to say goodbye.
This weapon from gunpoint...
Is now full of live bullets, love.
I loaded it myself last night.
I just can't have the play written, Cliff.
And I honestly cannot think...
Of any other way to stop you but this.
And I do not wish to join...
All the ex-mistresses of ex-presidents...
And former CIA assassins and happy hookers...
Lining up to tell Tom Snyder...
And Phil Donahue how it was.
That's not my style.
It's just not me, is it, love?
It's not going to be you either, love...
Spending the next 25 years slaving away at crappy jobs for no money.
You have got a very firm grip on unreality, Sid.
46 years old, you're written out, you're practically broke.
I'm afraid I told you a little fib.
Between the insurance which arrived a few days ago...
And what Myra really left,
I'll have about $1,000,000.
Plus, of course, this quite valuable property.
And I do hope to have another hit play someday.
Hope springs eternal.
-You shit! You'll never get away with this.
-Why not?
Such wildly extenuating circumstances.
I asked Porter to have you checked out in Riverhead...
Do a serious rundown.
And I spent this evening listening to his report.
Porter was shocked...
Very disturbed at this possibly quite dangerous young man...
I had innocently taken into my place.
Porter insists that the sooner
I send you packing, the better.
So I come home and I give you your notice.
But you become abusive and violent.
Luckily, I get to the gun.
I'm truly sorry, Cliff.
I shall miss you.
You opened up certain doors for me...
And for that I'm grateful.
God.
This is going to be even harder than I expected.
Good bye, Clifford.
Bye, Sidney.
Bang-bang.
Sorry the click is so anticlimactic, but I needed the bullets from that gun...
For this one.
Now sit down, dum-dum.
Sit down!
Right in that chair, thank you.
Reversal, Sidney. Remember?
You stressed it in the seminar, first day.
But you see, the problem was...
I had this terrific first act,
I just couldn't think of what came next.
Dialogue's a snap for me, but I still have a little problem with plotting.
And that was very frustrating, particularly because I'm sharing bed and board...
With the old master plotter himself.
Let's see.
I think you're about a 42 Regular.
You can put your gun down, Sidney.
Unlock them, please.
It's corny, but effective.
There I am with my problem.
See, Sidney's not going to help me, not voluntarily.
This I know 'cause Sidney uses three kinds of mouthwash...
And four kinds of deodorant.
Not for him the whiff of scandal.
But I think to myself...
Is there a way that maybe I can harness that 17-jewel brain...
And get it to work for me unwittingly?
So I go on drafting Act One...
And every time I leave the room,
I put it inconspicuously in the drawer.
So inconspicuously in fact...
That for a day-and-a-half, smart old Sidney doesn't even notice.
And then dull old Porter comes in and twigs right away.
What a relief.
So on we go with my scenario.
You rifling my desk, confronting me with the evidence, etc.
-You're a prick, you know that?
-Sticks and stones, Sidney.
Sidney, here we are, Bruhl and Anderson.
Now, I write, and Sidney thinks.
And I really don't sleep much.
Last night, for example...
I hardly got a wink with all your elephantine tiptoeing around.
Tin Pan Alley dialogue?
God, do you think I'm stupid?
That was dummy dialogue, dummy!
To keep you comfy while you're plotting.
For every wooden line I wrote there, there's an aerial one up here.
I mean, I am going to burn this shit myself when I leave here.
Now you give me the key, please.
And you put them on.
And I do thank you for Act Two, Sidney...
But we're not going to have a Long Island detective.
Julian's lawyer is the fifth character.
Julian finds out in Scene One...
That Victor is actually writing the real Deathtrap about Doris' murder.
He pretends that he will collaborate, through the arm of the chair.
Don't be stupid. Put the handcuffs through the arm of the chair.
Thank you.
Yes. Old Julian pretends that he will collaborate.
Meanwhile, he has his lawyer do some checking up on Victor...
Knowing that there are some charges to be found...
Most of them very, very unfair.
Julian sets Victor up for what will look like a murder in self-defense...
By getting him to act out bits of business from the play.
God, that's nice, Sidney.
I mean, wow! That is simple.
It is workable. It's gonna play.
I'm really in your debt.
So Julian shoots Victor...
Who's a handsome, charming, wonderful kid...
That Julian has led astray, seduced.
You big creep.
But just then Inga Van Bronk and the lawyer come in.
She's called him because she's been getting bad vibes all night.
They met at Doris' funeral.
Victor lives just long enough to tell the truth about himself and Julian...
And about Doris' funeral.
And then Julian shoots himself.
Curtain.
Is that it?
What do you mean, "Is that it?"
They're both dead dummy. The play's over.
Julian shoots himself?
That's exceedingly feeble, Clifford.
I'd be glad to think about it some more.
That's okay.
I can fill in the holes.
Now, here 's the big surprise, Sidney.
Are you ready?
I'm not gonna kill you.
I just wanted a hit play.
And I'm really not the total sociopath that you'd like to think.
Sidney, I'm gonna pack,
I'm gonna call a cab...
And I hope that I can get one...
Otherwise you'll have to sit there this way all night.
When the cab is safely at the door...
I'm going to give you the key and unlock one wrist.
You will tell people that you gave me my notice.
I accepted it with grace.
But if you hassle me in any way...
You will be opening up a very messy can of worms.
If you don't bother me until the opening of Deathtrap...
I'll say, "Yes, I got the idea years ago.
"I worked for Sidney Bruhl for a few weeks, but I left...
"'cause I was so depressed at the way he kept humping beautiful women...
"out of grief for his wife."
Electrical effects by God himself.
So long, Sidney.
It's really been educational.
Cliff?
Cliff?
You can come down.
Those were Houdini's handcuffs.
Hang in there, Long Island light.
Jesus!
They're gone.
Shit!
Candles.
Matches.
Shit! Matches.
Matches.
Candle.
I came to help. Such troubles.
But not trouble for you. Trouble from you.
Strictly speaking, Helga...
I'd say we're both in a spot of trouble.
Now you will want to kill me, ja?
First Mrs. Bruhl. Somehow you do that.
I'm right, ja? Then the boy ....
No! You've got it wrong.
He killed Myra.
And tonight, he tried to kill me.
Then why you need burn evidence if evidence prove he did it?
Ja, I don't think.
That's not evidence, Helga.
It's a manuscript, a play.
A play? About death?
I will read.
You will not kill me with this beautiful woman's dagger!
I will not allow that!
I don't wish to make violence,
Mr. Bruhl, but--
There are no bullets in that gun.
It's a stage prop.
If you don't believe me, check it out.
Ja, maybe I check it by pulling trigger.
Suit yourself.
But it's just as easy to check by--
If no bullets in gun, then you don't let me cross room to fireplace.
I thought I heard the gun drop.
You dropped it, didn't you, Helga?
Let go of the knife, Helga.
Get back, Helga! Get back!
Get back!
Inga, you're well out of this.
Bravo!
Helga baby, we've got ourselves a smash!
What a play you wrote!
We 're gonna make ourselves a fortune here.
Waste not, want not.
Hey, will you guys shut up in there?
Barbara.
Oh, shit.
What the hell is going on in here?
I am trying to study for a final.
Yeah, we have finals too.
Ever hear of modern dance?
- Can't you study to music?
- No, I can't study to music.
- Turn it down or do I have to go to Sue?
- Go to Sue, then. Fuck off.
- I'm going to Sue.
- I'm going to Sue.
Oh.
- Get off of me.
- What?
Oh. Oh.
Oh, there's somebody out there.
Come on. There's somebody out there.
- There's nobody out there.
- There is.
- Calm down.
- I can't calm down.
You better take care of it, cos I can't study with this disco music.
All right, move. Come on.
Oh, look. The little fink brought back the master fink.
- The music's not loud.
- Yes, it is.
God, that scream is terrible.
- What cat did you strangle to get that?
- That's her voice.
- You didn't dub that?
- No.
- That's hers?
- Yeah.
- Oh, really?
- Yes.
Run it again. I wanna hear the scream.
- ...Run it?
- Yeah.
And kill all the effects except for the scream.
Kill it.
You're right. It's hers. And it's shit.
Look, Jack, I didn't hire that girl for her scream. I hired her for her tits.
Then why worry?
Who's gonna be watching her scream?
Wait a minute. Come on, Jack.
Look, how many years have we worked together?
Let's see. I met you on Blood Bath, right?
And then we did Blood Bath II.
And then we did Bad Day at Blood Beach.
And then we did Bordello of Blood.
Well, that brings us up to date.
Co-ed Frenzy.
By the way, I didn't tell you this but...
I'd like to think this is our finest film.
- Almost two years.
- Oh, God. Five films in two years.
You know what I can't figure out? Why a smart guy like you is still doing that shit.
Come on. You do the shit. I do the sound.
No, you do the shit. That wind sounds like you're whistling in the crapper.
It's library stuff we used a million times.
That is the trouble.
I have heard it a million times.
- Get something new.
- New wind. Got it.
- And that scream. We gotta dub that.
- All right. Know any good screamers?
- I got a few ideas.
- I bet you do.
Just worry about the scream.
...a sweeping condemnation of White House policies.
The same poll gave evidence of a ground swell of support...
...for Governor George McRyan in his bid for nomination.
If an election were held today, Governor
McRyan would win hands down, drawing a remarkable 62 per cent of the vote to the president's 23.
The president's campaign manager,
Jack Manners, told reporters:
The president's had to make some tough decisions.
But when these policies are carried out...
...and the economic climate improves, as we confidently expect it will, the people will rally to support the president in the upcoming primaries.
A lot can happen between now and then.
Congress waits anxiously for Governor
McRyan to declare his candidacy.
They may not have long to wait. The governor is now at the Bellevue Stratford...
...where he will soon address the kickoff dinner of the Liberty Day celebration.
Some people think he will use the occasion to throw his hat into the ring.
Joan, any word from the Bellevue Stratford yet?
Not yet, Bill, but as soon as there is, we will be going there live.
Liberty Day is one of the most eagerly awaited of all Philadelphia celebrations.
But this year it's going to be extra special.
It is 100 years since the Liberty Bell was last rung. To honour this centennial,
...a parade on Saturday...
...will end up at Penn's Landing with a spectacular display of fireworks.
In addition, a full-size replica of the Liberty Bell has been made...
...from pennies donated by schoolchildren from every state in the Union.
And they'll be ringing it after the fireworks at Penn's Landing.
That's right.
Hold it. We've got the Bellevue Stratford.
Let's go live to our political correspondent, Frank Donahue, at the Liberty Ball at the Bellevue Stratford Hotel.
Frank, you look fabulous.
Have you spoken with the governor yet?
Yes, Joan, briefly. He just arrived.
I did ask the governor his impression so far of this year's Liberty Day Jubilee.
He said he was honoured to be here...
...and plans to attend the parade and the ringing of the new bell on Saturday night.
He felt it a shame the Liberty Bell had been silenced for so long.
He looked forward to a new voice of liberty throughout the land.
The governor is now greeting friends and will be enjoying a meal in the ballroom.
But his people have told us that he will speak to us after that meal.
I'm Frank Donahue. 'Eye on the City'
News, Bellevue Stratford.
Thank you, Frank.
We'll be getting back to you later on.
Meanwhile, in other news, a teacher's strike...
...Let's take a walk along the river here.
Mm. Nice.
- David, look. Someone's on the bridge.
- Let's not worry about that.
- He's staring right at us.
- Who cares?
- I care.
- Betsy.
- I don't wanna stay here. Let's go.
- Yeah, OK.
- What is he doing?
- I don't know.
- What is he, a Peeping Tom?
- Oh, who cares? Let's walk down there.
Jesus Christ.
Oh, God. Please help me.
Get me out of here, please.
Oh. Oh, God.
- A bang?
- Yeah, some sort of a bang.
- Where?
- I'm not sure where.
- You were facing the car?
- Yes.
Well, you heard the blowout.
Yes, but the first sound I heard was a bang.
- Some kind of an echo.
- No.
Look, I know what an echo sounds like.
I'm a sound man.
And the bang was before the blowout.
- What were you doin' up there?
- I was recording sounds for a movie.
- You recorded the accident?
- Yes.
What happened after that?
The car went off the road into the creek and I...
- What did you do then?
- I'm tryin' to tell you.
I ran down, jumped in the creek and pulled out the girl.
- There was a girl?
- Yes, there was a girl.
- What girl?
- The girl I brought here. In the room.
She was inside the car?
- Yes.
- Are you sure?
I wasn't bobbing for apples.
Of course I'm sure.
It can get pretty dark under eight feet of water.
Is this known as obtaining objective eyewitness testimony? If it is, forget it.
We gotta get the stretcher through.
Step back.
Doctor. How is she?
Very lucky. Mild shock, some cuts and bruises. No major injuries.
- Can I see her?
- She might be asleep. She's sedated.
- I'll just say goodbye.
- Don't stay too long.
How you doin'?
- Do you have my purse?
- No.
I'm sure the police'll find it.
I wouldn't worry about it.
I know.
- Where are you going?
- I have to leave now.
Wait a minute. I think you'd better get back to bed.
I don't think they're finished with you yet. Come on, up. Up.
- Just for a minute.
- All right.
So how do you feel?
He said I was lucky-- the doctor.
Yeah. He should've been there, huh?
- Thanks for getting me out.
- No problem.
I didn't realise you were this pretty, with all that mud.
I don't have any make-up on.
Well, don't worry about it.
It's fine. It's a hospital.
- Who are you?
- I'm Jack Terry. Who are you?
- Sally.
- Sally? Nice to meet you, Sally.
Are you leaving?
Yeah, I gotta go. But...
How about, when you get outta here, we have a drink sometime? In a glass.
- Sure.
- OK. You take care.
How about tonight?
No, I don't think so, Sally. Not tonight.
But I'll ask the doctor when you get out.
- He wants to keep me for observation.
- Sally, you gotta stay in bed.
I don't like to be observed.
I'm sorry, but there's nothing
I can do about that.
Please. I really don't like hospitals.
I've got to get out of here.
All right. I'll make you a deal, OK?
You stay here, I'll get your clothes, and when I come back, we'll go out and have a drink, OK? All right?
- I need shoes and a coat.
- Yes. I'll get them.
But if you don't stay, I'm not comin' back.
- OK.
- All right.
It looks like she's gonna be all right.
This guy, Jack Terry, that took her out of the car, he's over there.
He's being a real horse's ass. I don't know how we're gonna keep the lid on this guy.
Get some men here. I want this place sealed. I don't want this circus.
Sir, this is the guy. He was there when it happened. He saw the whole thing.
- He's the one who saw it?
- Yes. He pulled the girl out of the car.
I wanna talk to you.
And to the girl too. Where is she?
- She's in there.
- She's asleep.
And if you wanna talk to me, make it quick, cos I wanna go home.
- There someplace we can talk in private?
- I'll take care of it.
- Would you secure that room for us?
- I want these men checked out.
- Officer, what's goin' on here?
- Car accident. Guy got killed.
- I know, but what's the big deal?
- Did you know the guy was McRyan?
Governor McRyan?
That stiff on the stretcher was probably our next president.
- Hell, he had my vote.
- Jesus Christ.
Let's talk in here.
- You pulled the girl out of that car?
- Yes.
Well, I would like for you to forget about her. Forget you ever saw her.
Wait a minute.
- Who are you?
- My name is Lawrence Henry.
- I worked for Governor McRyan.
- Ah.
He was also a friend.
He was my friend.
Look, I'm very sorry about the governor, and I obviously would have loved to have saved his life too, but...
I mean, I was there and she was there.
We know what happened, but the governor is dead now and...
...we don't want to embarrass his family.
Do you have any idea what the press would do if they got ahold of this?
You want me to say she wasn't there?
I already told the police.
That's already taken care of.
- All right. What about the girl?
- I'll talk to her. She'll cooperate.
Just one playmate just vanishes from McRyan's car, just like that?
- That's right.
- Aw, Jesus, I don't know.
Can't you keep your mouth shut?
It's better the governor died alone.
I just don't know if I can do that.
I was there, she was there, and...
Who gives a damn that you were there?
You wanna tell his wife that he died with his hand up some girl's dress?
- Or let her read it in the papers?
- That is what happened.
- That is the truth, isn't it?
- What difference does that make to you?
But it would make a great deal of difference to his family.
All right.
Good. We'll slip you and the girl out the back.
How about your place?
You don't wanna go home, do you?
- They told you who was in the car, right?
- Yeah.
Well, some smart reporter could figure I was there too, you know?
They got my purse with my name and address.
They're gonna be camped on my doorstep.
What about my doorstep? I'm the one who pulled you out of that wreck, didn't I?
Yeah, right.
Let's go to a motel.
First it's a drink, then it's my place, now it's a motel.
Things are movin' fast tonight, Sally.
Whoops.
Stand here for a second.
- ...Beautiful night for a walk.
- Yes, it is.
Let's take a walk along the river here.
- Mm. Nice.
- David, look.
- Someone's on the bridge.
- Let's not worry about that.
- He's staring right at us.
- Who cares?
- I care.
- Betsy.
- I don't wanna stay here. Let's go.
- Yeah, OK.
- What is he doing?
- I don't know.
- What is he, a Peeping Tom?
- Oh, who cares? Let's walk down there.
Jesus Christ.
Shit.
So, uh... you want some coffee?
- Huh? You want some coffee?
- Mm. Good morning.
- Hi. How you doin'?
- I'm fine. How are you?
Pretty good. There you go.
What are you doin' here?
You listenin' to some music?
Nope. This is my... This is my job.
- I do sound effects for movies.
- Oh, movies, huh?
Matter of fact, last night
I was out recording some sounds.
What do you mean, sound effects?
You know, when you see a movie and you hear a door slam or a bird chirp or wind,
I record those actual sounds, and then I put them in a movie, and then you see the movie.
- Oh.
- Last night...
- Big movies?
- No. Just...
Just bad ones, unfortunately.
I really love movies, you know.
It's a very interesting subject to me because I do make-up.
Right now it's only behind a counter, but
I dream about doin' make-up for movies.
I've seen these big movie stars like Barbra Streisand, you know?
- They don't do it right.
- No.
- I know how to fix a face.
- Really? That's good.
I want you to hear something. Look.
Last night I was recording some sounds, and I recorded your accident.
I got the whole thing on tape.
- Oh. You recorded the accident.
- Yes, I did.
Except I don't think you had an accident.
I think your tyre was shot out.
- That's crazy.
- No, it's not. Listen to this.
You're gonna hear two sounds. The first is a gunshot, and the second is a blowout.
All right? Listen up.
- Now listen again.
- I heard a noise. Maybe it was a gunshot.
But, I'll tell you, I don't really feature listenin' to a replay of last night.
It's kinda depressing.
- Can I ask you something?
- What?
What were you doing with McRyan?
That's a very personal question.
That's none of your business.
- I don't mean the details. I just...
- I'm gettin' a cold here.
- Forget it, Sally.
- Personal questions.
- I don't even know who you are.
- I'd like you to get to know who I am.
- How about that drink?
- Some other time, OK?
Sally, I saved your life. The least you could do is have a drink with me.
All right. You can call me at my girlfriend
Judy Demming's. I'll be there.
- She's in the book.
- All right. You tellin' me the truth?
- Yeah.
- All right. I'm gonna call you.
OK.
Jack. They got movies of McRyan gettin' killed. I just heard.
- Maybe it's on the news.
- What?
Movies of McRyan gettin' killed.
Incredible as it may seem, a local photographer, Manny Karp, was on the scene of the accident with his camera.
Mr Karp sold his film to 'News Today' magazine this morning...
- News Today...
- Shh.
Our own Frank Donahue spoke with Mr Karp just a few moments ago...
...outside the magazine's offices.
Well, I'll tell ya. I had gone out there to try out this new film stock, right?
It's a very high speed. It's good for night shooting. I do a lotta work at night.
So I'm out there and all of a sudden I hear this car barrellin' down the road.
I didn't pay too much attention till all of a sudden I hear it startin' to skid.
I turn around, my camera's runnin' and I catch him goin' through the railing.
Mr Karp. Frank Donahue,
'Eye on the City' News.
Mr Karp, was the governor driving?
Was he in control?
Control? It went into the drink.
He wasn't in no control.
- Was he alone in the car?
- I didn't see anybody.
- Why didn't you go to the police?
- Oh, no. No, no, no.
- No cop ever did anything for me.
- Hey, Jack.
They ain't gonna give me money like these guys here.
- Where you goin'?
- I gotta go.
You gotta go? What about the auditions?
Exclusive photos. McRyan's death.
One at a time, please.
Exclusive photos. McRyan's death.
- It's about time.
- Is Rick in?
- No. But Sam's got girls for you to hear.
- Give me his key. Come on, come on.
- What about Sam and the girls?
- I'll do it later.
Jack?
Yo, Jack.
Come on, open up. It's Sam.
Jack.
This is the pivotal moment in the film.
You gotta realise that.
- Jack. Where are you goin'?
- Sam, I'll be right back.
I need you now. Now get in here.
- What do you think?
- Keep lookin'.
Keep lookin'? Hey, Jack.
- Sorry, Jack. I'm all stacked up.
- Please, just this once, as a favour to me.
I'll see what I can do.
Come back after midnight.
Sally? It's Jack.
See? I told you I'd call you.
How about that drink you promised?
Where are you goin'?
Why don't I meet you at the station?
Sally.
Hi.
- I'm so glad I caught you.
- Yeah, I was out the door.
Look, I only got 20 minutes.
That's fine. We'll have a quick drink and you'll be on your way.
Well... I wanna get a good seat, you know?
- Aw, come on, Sally. You promised me.
- OK, but just 10 minutes.
- OK. Come on. Let me take this.
- OK. Thanks.
- How are you feelin'?
- Pretty good.
- You look nice.
- Thanks.
What's the first thing you see when you meet somebody?
Legs. I'm a leg man.
- Come on.
- All right. Face. You see their face.
Exactly.
So, if your face doesn't look right, no one is gonna look at you again.
- I don't think your face needs make-up.
- Every face needs make-up.
- But it shouldn't look like make-up.
- Oh, I see.
I've worked on this face. I've hidden everything so you don't see the make-up.
- You got make-up on right now?
- Yeah, I do.
- I don't believe it. I don't believe it.
- Absolutely.
And, you see, this took me two hours.
And this is the 'no make-up look'.
Really? I'd like to see what the 'make-up look' looks like. I bet that's good, huh?
Well, I... I only do that for special occasions.
How about a broken nose?
How would you deal with that?
Oh, that's easy. You just take a little...
Wait a minute.
Let me see. I can show you.
Yeah. You get a brush like this, right?
You take a little brown powder.
- You just make a little brown...
- What are you doin'?
Hey, wait a minute.
This is serious business here.
- You interested or not?
- Oh, yes. OK. Sorry.
You make a brown line and kinda smudge it in.
It has to be real subtle so as no one'll notice it.
But... What are you smiling about?
I'm impressed that you know so much about this.
- You're not interested at all.
- Yes, I am.
You're not. You just kept me sittin' here talkin' so I'd miss my train.
That's not true, Sally.
I just didn't want you to go.
Why?
Because I like you, and I just met you and you're goin' off on me.
- I don't know anything about you.
- I'll tell you anything you wanna know.
- All right. You're a sound man, right?
- Yeah.
OK. How'd you get that job?
That's a good question. I don't know.
No, I'll tell ya. It all started in school, OK?
I was the kind of kid who fixed radios, made my own stereos, won all the science fairs - you know the type.
After that I went into the army, and I refined my skills there.
Oh, yeah? Were you in any wars or anything?
No, no. I was such a communication whiz, they wouldn't let me leave New Jersey.
Then I went into the police for a while, and after that I went into movies.
Wait a minute. You were a cop?
- No. I worked for the Kean Commission.
- What's that?
A group of politicians that got together to try to stop police corruption.
- Oh.
- Then I quit that and...
Well, what'd you do?
- It's a long story. You don't wanna know.
- Oh, I do. This is very interesting.
I thought you wanted to know about movies.
Yeah, movies are great, but this is... this is like real life on the streets. You know?
It's exciting.
All right.
I, um... I wired their best undercover cop.
A guy by the name of Freddie Corso.
And one of Freddie's cases was to set up a corrupt police captain...
...who was tryin' to shake down a Mob guy.
And my job was to rig a wire on him so I could record the conversation.
Wait a minute.
What do you mean, 'wire'?
It's a tiny mike attached to a transmitter that I strapped around Freddie's waist.
Mackey, hand me the tape.
- OK, Freddie, give me sound. Count to 10.
- One, two, three, four, five...
It was a great wire.
He could be blocks away...
...and you could hear everything within 10 feet of him.
- Hey, Milt. How ya doin'?
- Hello, Freddie.
- Good to see ya.
- You look good.
- You too. You look great in that get-up.
- Thanks.
So, uh... I brought somebody here I want you to meet.
Captain Kennedy, this is Milt.
Who the fuck wants to meet him?
- Milt, take it easy.
- Hey, I don't wanna meet him.
Hey, take it easy. This man could put the cap on everything.
All right, come on in the car.
We'll take a ride and talk.
And the first thing that the captain says to the Mob guy:
Look, I understand that the man has a brother-in-law.
Now, I happened to see him talkin' to his brother-in-law.
Now, the brother-in-law is a known felon, Freddie, and Milt's out on parole, and that's a parole violation.
Now, I'm gonna have to tell the parole officer. If I do, he's goin' back in the can.
But I think I could work somethin' out that
I don't have to tell him for... 5,000 bucks.
$5,000? Freddie, you little prick.
We started this thing for $1,000.
I'm gettin' this clear as a bell on tape and I start to hear the static.
You think you can?
You're outta your.
We can work this thing out.
- He's goin' up the river. You understand?
- Right.
What's the matter? You're sweatin',
Freddie. What's the matter?
The fuckin' whiz kid didn't figure
Freddie would get nervous and sweat.
The battery in the transmitter shorted out and burned a hole in him.
Hey, pull over to this gas station.
I gotta take a piss.
- Shit.
- What's wrong?
The battery in the transmitter is arcing.
It's burning him. I gotta get in there.
- You can't. You'll blow his cover.
- I gotta go in there.
- You can't.
- My fuckin' battery burned a hole in him.
- You're gonna screw things up.
- Shh.
- I gotta go.
- Jack, you're nuts.
Aw, Jesus Christ.
Aw... no.
- It wasn't your fault.
- Yeah, well, you tell that to Freddie.
- Shit.
- Are you OK?
No. Something's buggin' me. This whole thing with Henry, the governor's assistant.
Oh, he talked to you too, huh?
That's why I'm leavin' town.
He gave me some money to disappear for a while.
I thought so. Look, they are covering up a lot more than you being with McRyan.
- I know that tyre was shot out.
- How can you be so sure?
- Did you see the News Today photos?
- Yeah.
I found a way to put my sound with them.
And when you see it,
I'm sure you'll see it was no blowout.
I don't know.
Would you stick around for a couple of days?
- What for?
- I just think you could help me with this.
Jack, I don't know. I'm in a helluva lot of trouble already. If I stick around here...
If I can just clear myself of this...
We could go away together.
I mean... why not?
What the hell's the sense of goin' away by yourself?
- I don't know.
- Come on.
I have to think about it or somethin'.
I'll think about it.
Hey, Sal. How ya doin', huh?
It's good to see... I was just hangin' around, watchin' this great movie on TV.
You look terrific.
Yeah. So what are you doin' in Reading?
Listen, you want somethin' to drink here?
How about some Scotch?
- Yeah?
- It's Sally.
Hey, Sal. Hey, come on in. Come in.
You look great.
What are you doin' around here?
Jesus, Manny.
Don't they ever clean this place?
You gotta get up real early to catch a maid. I haven't made it yet.
Hey, I'm sure glad you come by, you know?
Listen, how'd you find me?
- We worked this place a million times.
- Oh, that's right. Hey, you want a drink?
- This isn't a social visit, Manny.
- Oh, no, huh? Oh.
You almost got me killed the other night.
Dead-- you understand?
Oh, hey, babe. I didn't have nothin' to do with that. That was an accident.
- What happened to you?
- What do you mean?
I took off as soon as I saw that kid jump into the creek.
He did a helluva lot better job than I coulda ever done.
You know, I don't know if I ever told you this before but... I can't even swim, babe.
Great.
Terry, do you know how many conspiracy nuts I've already had in here today?
No.
If I had a fuckin' dime for every one of 'em
I'd buy all of Florida and retire in peace.
It's very clear in these photos.
The flash and the smoke.
It could be a lot of things. Why the fuck does everything have to be a conspiracy?
A man has a couple too many drinks, he drives off the road, falls into a creek.
- Accident, plain and simple.
- It was not an accident.
I was there. That tyre was shot out.
I heard it. I recorded it.
So you're an earwitness to an assassination. It's got a nice ring.
- Are you heading up the investigation?
- Yeah.
- Did you check McRyan's tyre?
- No. Why should I?
It has a bullet hole. He was killed.
- Says you. Everybody else says accident.
- Who?
I got a special commission formin' here that's gonna say it was an accident.
That's gonna say it was?
They have no evidence. They don't have the tape, the tyre, they didn't speak to me.
I know all about you and your fuckin' tapes. You put a lotta good cops away.
That has nothin' to do with this, and I resent it.
I think you stink.
That's what it's got to do with it.
Hey, you. Just because I don't like you does not mean I'm not gonna do my job.
Now gimme that tape. I'll send it over to the lab and I'll have it checked out.
I want you to look at that film I made from those photos. I think you'll get the idea.
But if we can get Karp's original film, this gunshot'll be a lot clearer.
Karp is makin' a bundle sellin' his pictures to magazines.
What makes you think he'll give 'em to us?
- He's got to. It's evidence.
- I can't find him, Terry.
- It's your job, man.
- Don't tell me how to do my goddam job.
He could tell us what he was really doin' with his camera.
Nobody wants to know. Nobody cares.
No sordid details.
No political assassination. Accident.
This guy's dead. None of this shit's gonna do him any good now.
This isn't for him. I know he's dead.
Don't you understand? If they can get away with killing McRyan, who's next?
Who's 'they'? First tell me who 'they' is.
Is it a communist conspiracy? Or maybe it's ayatollahs in the street with blowguns.
- Oh, give me a break.
- Save your paranoia for public TV.
Fuck you. I'm leaving.
Put those pictures down, or I'll have you arrested for withholding evidence.
Is that right?
All right. I'll be at the office all day.
You can get me there.
I'll call you. Don't call me.
- It's Burke, sir.
- What?
It's Burke, sir.
- Burke. What have you done?
- I don't understand the question, sir.
Are you crazy? You were just supposed to get some pictures of him.
Are you aware of what you're saying, sir?
Where are you?
I'm calling from a secure phone booth.
I suggest you call me back on same.
Excuse me. Is Mr Karp in?
- Could I go in?
- What for?
- I just have to pick up some pictures.
- Are you anybody?
- I'm one of his customers.
- You know, he had a lotta customers.
- You're a reporter, ain't ya?
- No.
- You want Karp's film.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
If there was a law against lyin', I'd have made a lotta collars today - Mr Customer.
- I am a customer and I'd like my pictures.
- Yeah, he's a customer too.
- He offered me a thousand bucks.
- Really?
And his wife offered me three.
Doesn't seem worth it but I guess you had to be there, huh?
Looks like Karp did a little divorce work on the side.
Didn't give a shit about his customers.
I found these in a heap under his bed.
That's some baby picture.
You were supposed to get pictures of McRyan, not kill him.
I understood the objectives of the operation.
I didn't kill him. It was an accident.
You accidentally shot out the tyre of his car?
As you may recall, this was my plan as proposed at our meeting of June 6.
We rejected that plan.
Don't you remember?
I do admit I had to exceed the parameters of my authority.
But I stayed within an acceptable margin of error.
After all, the objective was achieved.
He was eliminated from the election.
Burke, I don't know you.
I've never seen you.
- Don't ever call me again.
- Just a minute. We got some loose ends.
I changed the tyre so it looked like a blowout.
I erased the sound guy's tapes so he'll seem like a crackpot.
Karp's disappeared, but I'll find him.
But that still leaves the girl.
I've decided to terminate her and make it look like one of a series of sex killings.
- This would secure our operation.
- What operation?
Come on, Betty. Try again.
Take 28.
Cut.
- Cut.
- Speak into the mike. They can't hear.
Oh, Christ. Cut.
All right, uh... switch.
Betty, you pull the hair. Jean, you scream.
Take 29.
- Sam. I'll be in my room.
- Hey. Where the fuck have you been?
I had some business to take care of.
Shut up.
- I thought you were workin' for me.
- I am. What's the problem?
- We need the effects for the other reel.
- Fine. I'll get 'em.
I haven't even got the scream for the first reel.
Yes.
Why don't you answer your phone?
It's the police.
- Who's been in here today?
- Some guy...
- What guy?
- I don't think I like your tone of voice.
- Yes?
- What is wrong with you?
- What?
- Your fuckin' tape had nothin' on it.
All my tapes are blank.
I don't get you. First you feed me all this nutty assassination shit.
Then you give me a blank tape. What for?
Because somebody erased it.
They've erased all my tapes.
Oh. Oh, yeah. 'They' - they erased your tapes.
Are they gonna be tryin' to kill you next?
You're fuckin' nuts.
Sally? It's Jack.
Listen to me. I have to show you that film that I made.
So just stay there. I'm coming right over.
- Is Jack Terry here?
- Sure.
- Frank Donahue. Channel...
- Debby.
- There he is now.
- Jack. How are you? I'm Frank Donahue.
- Eye on the City News.
- Oh, yes. Yes.
- Could I talk to you?
- No. Not right now.
Come on. Two minutes. That's all I need.
I came all the way here. Two minutes.
- What do you wanna talk about?
- It's sort of private.
Can we go back here and talk?
- Uh... yeah.
- Great, great.
So you make movies here, huh? I think
I'm a frustrated actor myself, Jack.
What do you want?
You told the police that someone shot out the tyre on McRyan's car.
- Who told you that? Who told you?
- Jack, that's not important.
I'm a reporter. I've got my sources.
Why would a guy like you be interested in some kind of assassination nut like me?
Jack, I don't think...
- Can we talk in here?
- No. No, no, no. Over here.
What do you mean, a nut?
I don't think you're a nut.
That's why I'm here.
I've looked into this thing, and a helluva lot of things don't add up...
...about this... what are the cops calling it-- a freak accident?
I mean, that girl-- everyone's pretending she wasn't in the car. You saw her.
What else did your source say?
Well, among other things, that you recorded that gunshot.
Great work, Jack.
I'd sure like to hear the tape.
- I could've made it in a recording studio.
- Well, you could have but...
I don't think you did.
I think you got a tape, Jack, and I think it's the real thing.
Let me put you on the air. Tell everybody what you saw that night, what you heard.
And then-- boom. We play that tape.
It's a great story. What do you think?
- It's bullshit. Nobody'd believe it.
- Hey. Frank Donahue believes it.
And he's got eight million people every night that watch him.
Go along with me. I guarantee you, by 8:30 tomorrow night, every one of those eight million sons of bitches will believe Jack Terry's story.
Yeah, that's what I heard.
Just before the tyre blew out.
You're right. It was a shot.
- You took this to the police, huh?
- Yes. I gave them a copy.
They sent it to the lab and it was blank.
- So somebody's erased it.
- Are you sure?
I transferred it myself, I played it back and now it's blank, like the rest of my tapes.
OK. Calm down. The sound is very clear.
It's the picture that's a little fuzzy.
Shit. They'd say I made it up in the lab, and they'd be right.
Whoever's in on this has contacts with the police. They want McRyan to vanish.
They don't wanna hear about my gunshot.
- Gee, what are you gonna do?
- What?
- What are you gonna do?
- You mean, what are we gonna do?
- What do I have to do with this?
- Cut the shit, Sally.
- I know what you were doin' in that car.
- What do you know?
You and Karp were settin' up
McRyan for blackmail, gettin' scummy pictures of him gettin' laid after the Liberty Ball.
You tell him running water under a well-lit bridge gets you hot?
- Who told you that?
- I saw your motel candid-camera shots.
You got nice tits. Who was paying you to flash 'em for McRyan?
I wasn't in the car.
Or haven't you read the papers?
Henry's cover-up won't last. I just talked to a reporter who knows everything.
They have erased my tapes, they've made you disappear, and next it's gonna be me.
- But I'm not disappearin'.
- Yeah? I am.
- It could be permanent.
- What do you mean?
- We did meet in a car wreck under water.
- But that was an accident.
- Manny wouldn't get me hurt.
- Didn't he get you into the car?
- Yeah, but he didn't know...
- He didn't know the tyre'd be shot out.
- He couldn't have.
- Come on, Sally.
If I hadn't been there to pull you out of the river, you'd be dead now. Don't you get it?
Sit down. Come on.
I wanna hear everything.
Just start right from the top. Come on.
It was just a job, like all the others. I'd get
'em into bed and Manny'd get it on film.
Them. Who's 'them'?
Husbands, city officials, mostly small-town guys.
Why?
- The money.
- Oh, you need the money that bad?
Come on. You know where I work.
I get paid to smile my ass off and show the 27 different lipsticks they're pushin'.
You know how much I make?
Shit is what I make. And I can't type.
So it doesn't leave a helluva lot, you know?
So I did it.
I didn't really have to do anything like screw 'em.
- Just make it embarrassing. I know.
- Yeah, right.
Manny said if a guy stuck his hand in the cookie jar, he deserves to get it cut off.
Can't cheat an honest man, right?
I guess I wanted to believe it.
It just made it easier.
- OK. McRyan. What about him?
- Manny got me into the Liberty Ball.
I went over to McRyan, told him how great he was, and he was very hot to show me.
So we slipped out the back and took off in his car.
- Who hired Manny to take these pictures?
- I don't know.
Don't you think Manny knew that his client was planning to shoot out the tyre?
No.
- It wouldn't pay to tell you, would it?
- Manny wouldn't do that.
- Didn't he wanna make an extra buck?
- Yeah.
Cos he's makin' big bucks now.
What's your cut?
- I got paid.
- Underpaid, probably.
- What do you care?
- I'm sick of bein' fucked by these guys.
First Henry gets me to shut up to preserve the reputation of the great governor.
Then I find instead of gettin' laid he gets murdered, and nobody wants to know.
Nobody wants to know about conspiracy.
I don't get it.
Let me tell you somethin'.
I know what I heard and what I saw.
I'll make sure everyone in this fuckin' country hears and sees it too.
And you're gonna help me. You find your pal Karp and get that original film.
This isn't any good. I need the original.
Cos if we don't get this on television for everybody to see, they'll close the book.
And any loose ends, like you or me, are gonna be cut right off. you can be crazy or dead. Either will do.
All right. I'll try and get the film. Then will you just leave me alone about all this?
I wish I was the only one you had to worry about.
- You're doin' a good job of scarin' me.
- I'm tryin' to save our asses.
I'll look after my own ass, thank you.
- Things aren't adding up, Manny.
- Yeah? Like what?
- There you go.
- How did I end up in that car?
Come on, sit down. Have a seat.
How did I end up in that car in the bottom of the creek?
Listen. The guy's drivin' along and all of sudden he has a blowout.
It wasn't a blowout, Manny.
Somebody shot out the tyre.
What are you talkin' about?
How do you know that?
I know. I just know.
- Now, who was it?
- It was nobody.
Come on, Manny. Just level with me.
All right. This nut, he calls me a couple of weeks ago...
...and he says he's workin' for some candidate.
Some candidate that's interested in gettin' McRyan out of the race.
Sounds like a normal Joe, right?
He says he's heard about our fine divorce work and offers me six grand.
Six? You told me three.
Yeah, well... three before and three after.
So when were you gonna tell me about the three after?
After I collected it. When do you think?
Yeah. Sure.
Hey. What's the matter with you?
You think I'm pulling your leg?
You don't believe me?
Listen. How was I gonna be sure that this guy was gonna come through?
I mean, six grand-- that's a lotta money for this kind of a job, huh?
- I'd say he got his money's worth.
- He wasn't supposed to die.
He wasn't even supposed to get hurt.
That was an accident.
I figured it out later.
This nut's idea was to shoot out the tyre of McRyan's car, cause a little crackup.
- The police come, pull him outta the car...
- With me?
Yeah, yeah, with you.
And I'd get it all on film.
Some little crackup.
He wasn't supposed to die.
That was an accident.
How many times I gotta tell you that?
Manny, we got him killed.
Oh, hey, wait. We?
What do you mean, we, huh?
We didn't do nothin'.
I was in the woods, you were in the car.
I didn't shoot out no tyre. Neither did you.
So, please, don't give me none of this conscience shit, huh?
Besides, nobody is exactly cryin' over the way things turned out.
What would've happened if the guy had lived?
His career was finished, thanks to us.
This way the guy comes out ahead.
He's a saint, a martyr. Christ, they passed one of his bills this morning.
You're a pig, Manny.
- And I'm a pig too.
- What the hell is with this 'pig' shit?
We gotta tell the truth before the books are closed and the loose ends are cut off.
What are you talkin' about?
McRyan was murdered and everybody should know that.
Are you crazy? We got him killed.
Do you wanna go to jail?
Yeah, but I was in the car and you were in the woods.
You think anybody is gonna believe that?
I don't know but I gotta do somethin'.
Yeah, like just keep your mouth shut and take the money.
Hey, babe. This is the biggest thing since the Zapruder film.
- I don't care.
- It's bigger.
This is history we got here, girl.
This is gonna be a goddam fortune.
It's gonna be in every newspaper.
It's gonna be in every magazine.
It's gonna be on the fuckin' six o'clock news.
They're gonna build TV specials around this thing.
And they're gonna ask a goddam fortune for it.
Hey. Don't you understand, sweetheart? We're set.
I don't care. I don't want any part of this thing. You can keep your three after.
Hey, don't be such a dope, huh?
Money's money.
We sound like a couple of vultures.
Pigs, vultures... You swallow a whole box of animal crackers?
I need a drink, Manny.
Come on, give me a drink.
- Yeah, sure I'll get us a drink.
- Just give me the bottle.
Hey, now you're thinkin', babe.
- We'll go over to Atlantic City maybe.
- I don't like Atlantic City.
- No? I'll show you around.
- Stop. Come on.
- We'll have a lot of good times.
- Manny, stop.
- We'll have a lotta laughs.
- Please, Manny, don't. Don't do this.
Manny, please. Please.
Relax, baby.
Fantastic. Ah.
Great.
- Well? Now what?
- You're great.
I'm gonna call that TV guy.
We're gonna get it on the air.
- Can I make you somethin' to eat?
- Yeah, fine.
- How about some cornflakes?
- Anything.
Frank Donahue, please. It's Jack Terry.
- Yeah?
- Jack Terry calling.
- Mr Donahue?
- Jack. Yeah.
I've changed my mind.
I want you to hear that tape.
I've also got Karp's film. If you run 'em together, it's clear it wasn't an accident.
That's great, Jack. Look, I can't talk now.
Can I get back to you in 20 minutes?
I don't know why.
She wanted me to do it.
She asked for it.
She begged me for it, the bitch.
I... I didn't wanna do it.
She made me do it.
You ask her. She'll tell you.
- OK. Where is she?
- I don't know. Somewhere.
In that big hole, near the Reading Market, where they're buildin' somethin'.
But don't listen to her. She made me do it.
OK. Just tell me where you are.
Where...
Listen, Jack. You realise this won't mean a thing unless you come on the air...
...and you say it's what you saw and heard?
- I'll say it's what I heard.
- OK. That's great.
Jack, what about that girl? She must have heard it. Can we get her on?
No. She did, but don't involve her, OK?
- Why not?
- She's not exactly proud of what she did.
OK. No problem, Jack.
But could I at least talk to her?
- Well, that's up to her. I...
- OK. Look, I'll take care of that.
Jack, could you hold on just one second?
- Jack, when can I see this stuff?
- Uh, any time.
Great. Can I give you a call this afternoon? Where can I reach you?
- I'll be home all day.
- OK. I'll call you then. So long.
- Oh, hi.
- I just spoke to Donahue.
- Who's he?
- A TV newsman. Does investigative news.
Oh, I don't watch the news.
What?
- What's he wanna do?
- He said he'd put it on the air.
- He'd call later and set up a meeting.
- Great.
He also said he'd like me to go on TV and say that it's what I saw and heard.
Said the tape wouldn't be any good without it.
- But he'd also like you to go on too.
- Oh, no. I don't want any part of it.
Well, I know you don't, but would you at least speak to him?
No, I don't want to.
Come on, Sally. They can't say we're both hearing things.
If we get this out in the open, there's no one that can hurt us.
All right, I'll think about it, OK?
At City Hall this morning, Chief Inspector
Mackey held a news conference.
He said a preliminary investigation into Governor McRyan's death...
...revealed that he was the victim of a freak accident.
- Bullshit.
- Also in the news...
...is the bizarre sex killing of Mary Robert, a 22-year-old receptionist from the Center City area.
Her body was found at 10 a.m. in the Reading Terminal excavation site...
...after police received a tip from an anonymous caller.
The girl had been strangled, then repeatedly stabbed with a pointed instrument across her stomach and groin.
The stab marks were in the pattern of a Liberty Bell.
The police are at a loss to explain this grotesque mutilation.
We asked forensic psychologist
Dr Joseph Fuchs...
...what connection there might be between the bell-shaped wounds...
...and the upcoming
Liberty Day celebration.
- Hi. This is Sally.
- Hi, Sally. Frank Donahue here.
Yeah, you were supposed to call Jack.
It's the damnedest thing. I can't get Jack on the phone to arrange a meeting.
His line's been busy all day. So I thought I'd give you a ring.
Yeah? So?
Something's wrong with your phone.
I kept gettin' a busy signal.
What do you mean?
I've been waitin' for Donahue's call.
- He was gettin' a busy signal too.
- How do you know that?
He called me. We're meeting at 30th Street Station at five.
How did he get your number?
- Didn't you give it to him?
- No.
Well, reporters have a way of gettin' numbers.
- So I'll give him the tape and the film.
- Why didn't he call me back?
He wants to meet me alone, to talk me into goin' on the air.
No, he should've called me back.
- Your phone is out of order.
- It is not out of order.
I've been here all day.
I made a phone call.
Here. Listen.
- Maybe the phone company's in on it.
- No, something's not right.
Let's just meet him. I'll give him the tape and the film and get it over with.
Once he's got the film, that's it.
All right. He wants to meet you, right?
- Yeah.
- OK. You're gonna go and meet him.
If he sounds OK, you'll give him the film and tape.
- Where are you gonna be?
- Close.
- I don't get it.
- I'm gonna wire you.
Wire me? What for?
I'm gonna cover all the bases.
Nobody's gonna fuck me this time.
This way, if he disappears with the film, he can't deny it cos I got him on tape.
Aren't you gettin' a little paranoid here?
He's a newsman. This is a very big story.
Why isn't he gonna put it on the air?
Look what happened when I took it to the police. They erased it, right?
- What are you doin'?
- Making a copy, to cover ourselves.
Yeah? Well, what about the film?
I can't make a copy now.
I don't have time to do that.
- OK, OK. Bring on the wire.
- Take off your coat.
OK. Let's get it over with.
- So you travel a lot, huh?
- Oh, yeah. I been all over the place.
Yeah, I travelled once.
So, uh... you say you got about 60 minutes and about 60 dollars?
- Oh, no. Did I say that?
- Yeah, you did say that.
No, I think... about 20 minutes and about 20 dollars is what I've got.
Gee, it's too bad you don't have about 40 minutes and about 40 dollars.
- Yeah, that's too bad.
- Yeah, that's too bad.
What I've got is about 20 minutes and about 20 dollars.
The trains are never on time.
They're notorious. Know what I mean?
I bet you at least got 30 minutes. At least.
- Do I have to have 30 minutes?
- At least 30 minutes.
You know, I believe I do have about 30 minutes and about 30 dollars.
Great. I'll make a quick phone call...
...and meet you in the back of the waiting room in two minutes.
That should be two dollars off but... we'll let you go this time. Know what I mean?
No, I don't know what you mean.
You know what I mean?
- See ya.
- Yeah. I know what you mean.
Hey, Ralphie.
I gotta have a 20.
Just enjoy your puppet show.
Have a good Liberty Day.
- Slower. Aw, shit.
- Some hotshot sailor you are.
That's ridiculous. Why don't you grow up and learn a thing or two, sailor boy?
I've been on a sh...
Ten for you, baby. Ten.
- Hey, what about my $30? You fuck.
- You blew it. You know what I mean?
Shit.
...Attention, please.
This will be the last call...
...for the Broadway Limited to Pittsburgh and Chicago.
All passengers travelling all the way to Chicago, and passengers holding space in car 4140...
- Aren't you overdoin' this a little bit?
- We've got nothin' to lose.
If I had any sense, I'd take this stuff and dump it in the trash, and that'd be it.
- Yeah, but I got the original at home, so...
- So why all this?
Because of Manny's film. I told you.
We gotta be careful with it.
You know, the only real trouble
I ever got into was when I was too careful.
Give me a sound level. Count to 10, slow.
- One, two, three, four...
- No, just normal.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
- All right.
- Come on. We gotta get goin' here.
- Look, don't forget you got this on, OK?
- OK.
If you need me, talk to me. It's right there.
OK. Affirmative.
- Sally, come here.
- What?
Thank you.
Over and out.
Hello, Jack? Can you hear me?
Like I was saying before about goin' to New York. We could see some shows.
You know, like Sugar Babies. And I know a great hotel in the Times Square area...
Sally?
- Hi. I'm Frank Donahue.
- Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.
Would you mind walking with me for a moment?
Where are we goin'?
- I think we got a little problem.
- What's that?
It sounds crazy but...
I think we're being followed.
Yeah. No problem.
...Gee, you're a fast walker.
Well, in my business you gotta be fast on your feet.
- Where's Jack?
- Uh... Oh, he's at home, resting.
- The pressure can get to you.
- Which train are we takin'?
- I don't know yet. Got the tape and film?
- Yeah, right here in my bag.
- I guess we lost him, huh?
- Well, we can't be too careful.
Tell you what. Walk slowly down to the end of the platform right in front of me.
I don't know why you think anyone'd wanna follow us anyway.
You'd be amazed what some people would do for a story like this.
- Yeah, I guess so.
- No, don't turn around.
- We don't wanna give ourselves away.
- Yeah, right.
Just pretend like nothing's happened, all right?
Just look at this place.
This is disgusting.
- Yeah. It's a real shame.
- And it's not even safe any more.
It reminds me of that story about that guy in New York. Remember?
- Yeah, I think we did a piece on him.
- He'd ride the subways at rush hour.
He'd stand in the corner real quiet so's nobody'd notice him.
Then they'd pull in to a station, he'd open his coat and pull out a big meat cleaver, and whack 'em right over the head.
- Let's go, Sally.
- And then they had this transit strike.
He just disappeared.
It was like he went on strike too.
So I don't ride the subways.
It's not safe. I wouldn't even come down here if it wasn't for you.
Speak up. Come on.
You see what I mean? See that creepy character? It's just not safe any more.
The train's coming.
Franklin Bridge Express.
Is that where we're goin'?
- Where? Come on.
- That where they're having the fireworks?
That's right.
They got a nice bar down there.
Why don't we have our drink and our little chat, then take in the fireworks?
Sure, OK.
- Want to help me cover the story?
- All right.
- You could give us the woman's angle.
- Yeah.
Franklin Bridge Express, huh?
Hey.
Sally. Sally.
- So what's the big deal with Liberty Day?
- Did you see our story?
I don't watch news. It's too depressing.
Somebody get an ambulance.
Try that back door.
Is it 16 or 35?
- What do you mean?
- The gauge of the film.
They've only got 16mm equipment out at the station.
- I think that's what it is.
- Why don't you let me have a look?
- Oh, sure.
- Come into the light.
Here it is.
- Got the tape too?
- Yeah.
Yeah, that's 16 all right.
Are you... wrappin' it up?
What did you do that for?
Jack's gonna kill you.
Oh, God, no. No.
One more sound and you're dead.
Come on, Sally. We're gonna cover the fireworks, remember?
Jack, please.
Jack. Please.
No.
God, Jack...
...Hello, Jack? Can you hear me?
Like I was saying before about goin' to New York. We could see some shows.
You know, like 'Sugar Babies'.
And I know a great hotel...
...Two more young women were killed by the Liberty Bell Strangler.
But the tragedy ended when the final victim, Sally Badina, killed her attacker in a bloody struggle on the top of the Port of History building...
...during the Liberty
Day firework celebration.
The identity of the strangler has not yet been determined.
Governor McRyan's death continues to send shock waves throughout the nation.
...Oh, Jack.
Oh, God. Oh, please.
...Jack, please.
Oh, God. God, Jack.
Now, that's a scream.
- How was the level?
- More on the scream.
- I don't wanna distort it.
- Come on. Bring it up.
- All right. I'll give it more the next time.
- That's wonderful.
- What'd you think of the rest of the mix?
- Uh, OK. On the beginning...
It's a good scream.
It's a good scream.
It's a good scream.
Having reached the end of my poor sinner's life...
... I prepare to leave, on this parchment, my testimony...
... as to the wondrous and terrible events that I witnessed in my youth...
... towards the end of the year of our Lord, 1327.
May God grant me the wisdom and grace...
... to be the faithful chronicler of the happenings that took place...
... in a remote abbey in the dark north of Italy.
An abbey whose name it seems even now...
... pious and prudent to omit.
May my hand not tremble now that I start to relive the past...
... and revive the feelings of uneasiness that oppressed my heart...
... as we entered the battlements.
Should we tell him?
No.
He will look in the wrong places.
But...
...what if he should learn it of his own accord?
You overestimate his talents, my lord abbot.
There is only one authority capable of investigating such matters.
The Holy Inquisition.
What is your opinion,
Venerable Jorge?
Dear brethren...
...I leave such worldly matters to younger men.
Adso.
Yes, master?
In order to command nature...
...one must first learn to obey it.
Return to the forecourts, get the edificium on your left...
...enter the quadrangle on your right, you'll find the place you need.
Behind the third arch.
But you told me you'd never been to this abbey.
When we arrived, I saw a brother making for the spot in some haste.
I noticed, however, that he emerged more slowly...
...with an air of contentment.
Thank you, master.
On behalf of the Benedictine order, I am honored to welcome you...
...and your Franciscan brothers to our abbey.
The other delegates, they have arrived?
Ubertino de Casale has been here for some weeks.
The others are due tomorrow.
You must be very tired after your long journey.
No.
Not particularly.
I trust you're not in need of anything?
No. Thank you.
Well...
Well, then I bid you peace.
I'm sorry to see one of your brethren has recently been gathered unto God.
Yes, a terrible loss.
Brother Adelmo was one of our finest illuminators.
- Not Adelmo of Otranto.
- You knew him?
No, but I knew and admired his work.
His humor and comic images...
...were almost infamous.
- But he was said to be a young man.
- Oh, yes.
Yes, very young indeed.
- An accident, no doubt?
- Yes.
Yes, as you say, an accident.
Well, that is, I...
Brother William...
...may I speak with you candidly?
You seem most anxious to do so.
When I heard you were coming to our abbey...
...I thought it was an answer to my prayers.
"Here," I said, "is a man who has knowledge, both of the human spirit...
...and of the wiles of the evil one."
The fact is, Adelmo's death has caused much spiritual unease among my flock.
This is my novice, Adso...
...the youngest son of the Baron of Melk.
Please do continue.
We found the body after a hailstorm...
...horribly mutilated, dashed against a rock at the foot of the tower...
...under a window, which was...
How shall I say this?
- Which was...
- Which was found closed.
- Somebody told you.
- Had it been found open...
...you would have concluded that he'd fallen.
Brother William...
...the window cannot be opened...
...nor was the glass shattered...
...nor is there any access to the roof above.
Oh, I see.
And because you can offer no natural explanation...
...your monks suspect the presence of a supernatural force within these walls.
That's why I need the counsel...
...of an acute man such as you,
Brother William.
Acute in uncovering...
...and prudent, if necessary...
...in covering up...
...before the papal delegates arrive.
Surely you know, my lord,
I no longer deal in such matters.
I am indeed reluctant to burden you with my dilemma...
...but unless I can put the minds of my flock at rest...
...I will have no alternative but to summon the help of the Inquisition.
Adso!
That is Ubertino de Casale...
...one of the great spiritual leaders of our order.
Come.
Many revere him as a living saint...
...but others would have him burned as a heretic.
His book on the poverty of the clergy isn't favored reading in papal palaces.
So now he lives in hiding like an outlaw.
Fellow Franciscans...
...you must leave this place at once.
The devil is roaming this abbey.
Ubertino...
...it's William.
William of Baskerville.
William...?
No.
No.
William is dead.
William, my son...
...forgive me.
We had lost trace of you for so long.
I tried very hard to be forgotten.
When we heard of your troubles...
...I prayed to our virgin for a miracle.
Then your prayers met with a favorable response.
This is my young novice,
Adso of Melk.
His father has entrusted me with his education and welfare.
You must get him out of here!
Have you not heard, the devil is hurling beautiful boys out of windows?
There was something...
...feminine...
...something diabolical...
...about the young one who died.
He had the eyes of a girl...
...seeking intercourse with the devil.
Beware of this place.
The beast is still among us.
I can sense him now, here...
...within these very walls.
I'm afraid, William...
...for you, for me...
...for the outcome of this debate.
Oh... My son.
The times we live in.
But let us not frighten...
...our young friend here.
She's beautiful, is she not?
When the female...
...by nature, so perverse...
...becomes sublime by holiness...
...then she can be the noblest vehicle of grace.
IN LATIN:
- I don't like this place.
Really?
I find it most stimulating. Come.
Adso, we must not allow ourselves to be influenced...
...by irrational rumors of the Antichrist.
Let us instead exercise our brains...
...and try to solve this tantalizing conundrum.
IN LATIN:
My master trusted Aristotle, the Greek philosophers...
... and the faculties of his own remarkable, logical intelligence.
Unhappily, my fears were not mere phantoms of my youthful imagination.
A rather dark end for such a brilliant illuminator.
Another generous donation by the church to the poor.
Now, what if it wasn't that tower that he fell from...
...but somewhere over there, and then the body rolled all the way down here?
Adso?
No devil needed anymore.
Yes. More blood here.
That's where he fell from.
He jumped.
Adso, are you paying attention?
Yes. He jumped.
He jumped? You mean that he committed suicide?
Yes. Why else would someone go up there at night in a hailstorm?
- Certainly not to admire the landscape.
- No. Perhaps...
Perhaps someone murdered him.
And then toiled all the way up there with the body?
Easier to get rid of it through that sluice gate they pour charity through.
No, no. My dear Adso...
...it's elementary.
Suicide.
Do you think that this...
...is a place abandoned by God?
Have you ever known a place where God would have felt at home?
We praise almighty God...
...that there are no grounds for suspecting an evil spirit among us...
...either of this world or another.
We praise our Lord that the debate...
...which we are so greatly honored to host...
...may now proceed without a shadow of fear.
We also praise the Almighty for sending
Brother William of Baskerville...
...whose experience in previous duties...
...although onerous to him...
...has been of such service to us here.
May serenity and spiritual peace...
...reign once more in our hearts.
IN LATIN:
Master?
Hmm?
If I may ask, what...
..."onerous duties"...
...was the abbot talking about?
Were you not always a monk?
Even monks have pasts, Adso.
Now, do try to sleep.
I just...
Yes, master.
IN LATIN:
The beast...
The virgin...
This one, I grant you, did not commit suicide.
- Water!
Here.
I am to blame.
Had I not been so eager to believe your convenient explanation...
...this might have been prevented.
I am absolutely convinced that Brother Adelmo took his own life.
- Now, whether...
- Then the hail...
Whether this death is connected in any way with it, I intend to find... after the hailstorm...
...with the second trumpet...
...the sea became blood...
...and behold...
...here is blood.
- The prophecy of the apocalypse!
- The third trumpet.
A burning star...
...will fall in fountains of water.
Do not squander!
The last seven days!
Grated stem of waterwort for treating diarrhea.
And as for onions...
...administered in small quantities, warm and moist...
...they help prolong the male erection...
...in those who have not taken our vows, naturally.
Do you find many circumstances...
...in which you apply arsenic,
Brother Severinus?
Yes, indeed. It is a most effective remedy for nervous disorders...
...if taken as a compound in small doses.
And what of not-so-small doses?
Death.
What was this man's function here?
He was our finest translator of Greek...
...entirely devoted to the works of Aristotle.
Was he on friendly terms with the handsome young Adelmo?
Oh, indeed so. They worked together in the scriptorium.
But in a brotherly way, you understand. Not like...
I mean, flesh can be tempted according to nature...
...or against nature.
And they were not of the latter disposition...
...if you ascertain my meaning.
Watch out for the dracul who cometh in futurum to gnaw on your anima!
Ugly con Salvatore, eh?
My little brother, penitenziagite.
"Penitenziagite."
You said, "penitenziagite."
I heard you.
Master?
What language was he speaking?
All languages, and none.
And what was the word you both kept mentioning?
Penitenziagite.
- What does it mean?
- It means the hunchback, undoubtedly...
...was once a heretic.
Penitenziagite was the rallying cry of the Dolcinites.
Dolcinites? Who were they, master?
Those who believed in the poverty of Christ.
So do we Franciscans.
But they also declared that everyone must be poor.
So they slaughtered the rich.
You see, Adso...
...the step between ecstatic vision and sinful frenzy...
...is all too brief.
Well, then, could he not have killed the translator?
No. No. Fat bishops and wealthy priests...
...were more to the taste of the Dolcinites.
Hardly a specialist of Aristotle.
But, yes, you're right.
We must keep an open mind.
Hmm...
We are very fortunate to have such snowy ground here.
It's the parchment on which the criminal unwittingly writes his autograph.
Now, what do you read from these footprints here?
That they are...
...twice as deep as the others.
- Good, Adso.
And thus we may conclude...?
- Well, that the man was very heavy.
- Precisely.
And why was he very heavy?
Because...
...he was very fat?
- Or because he was being burdened...
...with the weight of another man.
Let us commit the autograph of this sole...
...to our memory.
But the footprints lead away from the jar...
...in this direction.
Oh, you turnip, Adso.
You're discounting the possibility...
...that the man was walking backwards, dragging the body thus...
Hence, the furrows created by the heels.
Now, where did the erudite
Greek translator...
...meet the anonymous author of his death?
Hmm?
Brother librarian.
Perhaps you will permit us to examine the work of the two unfortunates...
...so distressingly gathered unto God.
Your request is most unusual.
As are the circumstances of their deaths.
Brother Adelmo sat there.
Thank you.
IN LATIN:
A donkey teaching the scriptures to the bishops. Hmm.
The pope is a fox.
The abbot is a monkey.
He really had a daring talent...
...for comic images.
IN LA TIN:
I trust my words did not offend you,
Brother William...
...but I heard persons laughing at laughable things.
You Franciscans, however, belong to an order where merriment...
...is viewed with indulgence.
- Yes, it's true.
St. Francis was much disposed to laughter.
Laughter is a devilish wind...
...which deforms the lineaments of the face...
...and makes men look like monkeys.
Monkeys do not laugh.
Laughter is particular to man.
As is sin.
- Christ never laughed.
- Can we be so sure?
There is nothing in the scriptures to say that he did.
Nothing in the scriptures says that he did not.
Even the saints have employed comedy...
...to ridicule the enemies of the faith.
For example, when the pagans plunged
St. Maurus into the boiling water...
...he complained his bath was too cold.
The sultan put his hand in, scalded it.
A saint immersed in boiling water does not play childish tricks.
He restrains his cries and suffers for the truth.
And yet, Aristotle devoted his second book of Poetics...
...to comedy as an instrument of truth.
- You have read this work?
- No, of course not.
- It's been lost for many centuries.
- No, it has not. It was never written.
Because providence doesn't want futile things glorified.
- Oh, that I must contest...
- Enough!
This abbey's overshadowed by grief...
...yet you would intrude on our sorrow with idle banter!
Forgive me, Venerable Jorge.
My remarks were truly out of place.
- Which was the Greek translator's desk?
This one.
Come, Adso.
Well, Adso, what did you deduce from that visit?
That we are not meant to laugh in there.
But did you notice how few books there were on the scriptorium shelves?
All those scriveners, copyists, translators, researchers, thinkers...
But where are the multitude of books that they need for their work?
And for which this abbey is famed?
Where are the books?
- Are you testing me, master?
- What do you mean?
Well, with all due respect...
...it seems that whenever you ask me a question, you already have the answer.
- Do you know where the books are?
- No.
But I'll wager my faith that that tower contains something other than air.
Did you notice that little door the librarian closed as we came in?
Yes.
Could that lead to the library?
Master! Master, quick!
I have him!
Stop! Enough!
Master, he tried to kill us!
Salvatore!
Please, my lord, don't talk to the abbot about his past.
He's innocent of the deaths in this abbey. I swear it.
Brother, we need you.
My price is some information.
I could not comprehend why my master so quickly dismissed...
... my suspicions of the heretical hunchback...
... and why it was so urgent that we visit the tower.
I assumed he could not resist the temptation...
... to penetrate the library and look at the books.
No lock. Just as I thought, it must be bolted from the inside.
How do we get in?
Well, obviously, there must be another entrance.
Let us see what the moon-faced assistant librarian...
...was trying to conceal from us this morning, shall we?
Tiny Greek letters, perhaps written by an ant with inky feet.
Ah, yes.
Written with lemon juice.
Sagittarius.
The sun.
Mercury.
Scorpio.
It's some zodiacal code giving directions, but to where?
Hey! Who's there?
Who's there?
- My magnifying glasses!
They were on that book.
You go that way.
Come on out, you little bitch.
I know you are here.
I can smell you.
What's the matter with you, huh?
Are you afraid of me?
Huh?
I'll find you.
Who was she?
Who was this creature that rose like the dawn...
... was bewitching as the moon, radiant as the sun...
... terrible as an army poised for battle?
Good evening, Salvatore.
This is where you catch them?
You see, they are piu grasso. Bigger, eh?
You...
You eat them?
You like?
Thank you, no. No.
As you're a good Christian, you must tell me this.
So Adelmo gave the parchment to Berengar.
No, no.
To the translo...
The transla...
Translator!
Venantius, the black monk.
- And what happened then?
- Then...
Master! In here, quick.
I found another one.
Where are your wits, boy?
Have you ever met anyone...
...with a rib cage large enough to accommodate a heart of that dimension?
No.
No.
It is the heart of an ox.
One of the monks probably gave it to that peasant girl...
...in exchange for her favors.
Girl? Well, what...?
The one I saw scuttling out of here.
- He must have been a very ugly monk.
Why ugly?
If he'd been young and beautiful...
...she would no doubt have blessed him with her carnal favors for nothing.
In any event, whatever happened in this dreadful kitchen...
...has no bearing on our investigations.
Salvatore convinced me that Brother
Berengar, the assistant librarian...
...is the key to the whole enigma.
What did you say?
Nothing, master.
- Good.
Master?
There's something I must tell you.
I know.
Then will you hear my confession?
Well, I'd rather you told me first as a friend.
Master.
Have you...
...ever been...
...in love?
In love? Yeah. Many times.
- You were?
- Yes, of course.
Aristotle, Ovid, Virgil...
- No, no, no. I meant with a...
- Ah.
Are you not confusing love with lust?
Am I?
I don't know.
I want only her own good.
I want her to be happy.
I want to save her from her poverty.
- Oh, dear.
- Why "oh, dear"?
You are in love.
Is that bad?
For a monk, it does present certain problems.
But doesn't St. Thomas Aquinas praise love above all other virtues?
Yes. The love of God, Adso.
The love of God.
And the love of woman?
Of woman, Thomas Aquinas knew precious little.
But the scriptures are very clear.
Proverbs warns us, "Woman takes possession of a man's precious soul."
While Ecclesiastes tells us,
"More bitter than death is woman."
Yes, but...
- What do you think, master?
- Well...
Of course, I don't have the benefit of your experience.
But I find it difficult to convince myself...
...that God would have introduced such a foul being into creation...
...without endowing her with some virtues. Hmm?
How peaceful life would be without love, Adso.
How safe.
How tranquil.
And how dull.
How beautiful.
Lord, you have guided our steps...
...to this refuge of spiritual peace...
...because you wish for reconciliation as much as we Franciscans.
- Let us go, brothers.
Thy will be done, O Lord.
Amen. Amen.
Brother Berengar?
He's probably hiding somewhere...
...with the book and my magnifying glasses.
Brother Berengar.
Master, look. The door.
Ah.
Brother Malachia. I was just looking for your assistant, Brother Berengar.
- Is he here?
- No.
Oh, I see.
- Do you know where we might find him?
- No.
- Is he perhaps upstairs in the library?
- No.
I am curious to see the library for myself.
- May I do so?
- No.
Why not?
It is a strict rule of the abbot that no one is permitted...
...to enter the abbey library other than myself and my assistant.
I see.
Thank you again.
Maybe something's happened to him.
- Maybe we'll find him in water.
- What?
The third trumpet, master, as Ubertino said.
- The book of Revelation.
- That is not the book we're after.
You call this chicken, do you?
It looks more like a sparrow.
Welcome to our abbey, Brother Michele, and to your fellow Franciscan delegates.
Hey, you, paesano! Go!
You get in line like the others. Go!
Unhand me!
- Salvatore, let him go.
This is Cuthbert of Winchester, one of our most esteemed Franciscan guests.
Come, Your Grace. We have a most urgent matter to discuss.
The abbot and his colleagues seem convinced...
...that the devil is at work within these walls.
He is.
The only evidence
I see of the devil...
...is everyone's desire to see him at work.
What if Ubertino is right and you wrong?
Don't forget this debate is crucial to us all.
We suspect the pope wants to crush our order.
Yes, and declare us all heretics.
I only have one brother to question, and the entire matter is resolved.
William, we place our trust in you.
Pray God you do not abuse it.
Brother William.
Did you find a book in Greek?
No.
I was right.
So was the book of Revelation.
- We must talk at once.
- Indeed, we must.
And I have much to tell.
Just as soon as he and I have examined this corpse.
Lime leaves in the bath are always used to alleviate pain.
- He was left-handed.
Yes, yes.
Brother Berengar was inverted in many ways.
Are there other left-handed brothers in the abbey here?
None that I know of.
Ink stains.
He did not write with his tongue,
I presume.
- A few lines of Greek.
Yes.
Written by Venantius.
Some random notes from the book he was reading just before he died.
Do you see how the calligraphy changes?
From this point on, he was dying.
And what, my lord, do you conclude from that?
A smudge of blue paint.
Yes, but a unique smudge of blue...
...blended by your finest illuminator,
Brother Adelmo...
...who possessed this parchment before Venantius.
And how do we know that?
Because those random notes...
...overrun Adelmo's blue smudge, and not vice versa.
Brother William, this abbey is enshrouded in a terrifying mystery.
Yet I detect nothing in your obscure dissertation...
...that sheds any light upon it.
Light.
Someone was at great pains to conceal a secret of the first magnitude.
Now, the calligraphy is, without question, left-handed.
And the only left-handed member of your community is...
...or rather was, Brother Berengar, the assistant librarian.
Now, what kind of secret knowledge would he have been privy to?
I have the feeling that you're about to tell me.
Books. Restricted books.
Spiritually dangerous books.
Everyone here knew of the assistant librarian's passion for handsome boys.
When the beautiful Adelmo wanted to read such a forbidden book...
...Berengar offered Adelmo the key to its whereabouts...
...enciphered on that parchment...
...in exchange for unnatural caresses.
- Enough, Brother William!
Adelmo agreed and duly submitted to Berengar's lustful advances.
Afterwards, wracked by remorse, he wandered...
... crying and desperate in the graveyard, where he met the Greek translator.
- How could you know this?
- There was a witness.
The hunchback...
... who saw Adelmo giving this parchment to Venantius.
Then running towards the small tower and hurling himself out of the window.
The night of my arrival, while
Berengar punished his sinful flesh...
... Venantius, helped by the coded instructions on the parchment...
... made his way into the forbidden library and found the book.
He took it back to his desk in the scriptorium and began to read it.
After scribbling down those few mysterious quotations...
... he died with a black stain on his finger.
The assistant librarian discovered the body...
... and dragged it down to the pigpens to avert suspicion falling on him.
But he left his autograph behind.
The book remained on the translator's desk.
Berengar returned there last night and read it.
Soon after, overcome by some agonizing pain...
... he tried to take a soothing bath with lime leaves and drowned.
He, too, had a blackened finger.
All three died because of a book which kills...
...or for which men will kill.
I therefore urge you to grant me access to the library.
Brother William!
Your pride blinds you.
By idolizing reason...
...you fail to see what is obvious to everyone in this abbey.
They have arrived, the papal delegation.
Bernardo Gui...
Thank you, Brother William.
We are mindful of your efforts...
...but I should now ask you...
...to refrain from further investigations.
Happily, there will be someone arriving with the papal delegation...
...who is well-versed in the wiles of the evil one.
A man, I believe, you know only too well.
Bernardo Gui...
...of the Inquisition.
Master.
Who is Bernardo Gui?
William! I've been searching the entire abbey for you.
Michele wishes to speak with you at once.
Alone.
Do you know who is coming?
- I know, I know. Bernardo Gui.
Ubertino must be moved to a safe place.
The arrangements have been made.
It is you that concerns us, William.
You must now put aside these totally irrelevant investigations.
- And erroneous conclusions.
- It is the truth, and I am right.
William is right.
William is always right!
No matter what the consequences, to himself or anyone else...
...William of Baskerville must always prove himself right.
Was it not your vanity, your stubborn intellectual pride...
...that brought you into conflict with Bernardo before?
Do not tempt fate twice, William.
Even the emperor won't be able to save you if you tangle with Bernardo again.
My flesh had forgotten the sinful pleasure that our union had given me...
... but my soul could not forget her.
And now...
Now that I saw her in the midst of her poverty and squalor...
... I praised God in my heart that I was a Franciscan.
I wanted her to know that I did not belong to this rapacious abbey...
... but to an order dedicated to lifting her people out of their physical destitution...
... and spiritual deprivation.
Farewell, William.
You are mad and arrogant...
...but I love you and shall never cease to pray for you.
Goodbye, dear child.
Try not to learn too many bad examples from your master.
He thinks too much.
Relying always on the deductions of his head...
...instead of trusting in the prophetic...
...capacities of his heart.
Learn to mortify your intelligence.
Weep over the wounds of our Lord!
Oh. And do throw away those books!
There is a side of Ubertino that I truly envy.
Remember, fear the last trumpet, my friends.
The next will fall from the sky, and then will come 1000 scorpions.
Yes, yes. We won't forget.
Which one frightens you most?
- They all do.
- No. Look closely.
- That one.
- My choice exactly.
Well...
After you.
Those are the foundations of the tower.
But how we reach the library...
The rats love parchment even more than scholars do.
Let's follow him.
166. Bolted scriptorium door.
Oh...
I knew it!
Adso! I knew it!
Adso, do you realize...
...we're in one of the greatest libraries in the whole of Christendom?
How will we find the book we're looking for?
In time.
Oh... The Beatus of Liébana.
That, Adso, is a masterpiece.
And this is the version annotated by Umberto de Bologna.
How many more rooms, huh?
How many more books?
No one should be forbidden to consult these books freely.
Perhaps they are thought to be too precious, too fragile.
No. It's not that, Adso.
It's because they often contain a wisdom different from ours...
...and ideas that could encourage us to doubt...
...the infallibility of the word of God.
Master?
And doubt, Adso, is the enemy of faith.
Master?
Master?
Master!
Wait for me!
But I am waiting for you.
But I can hear you walking.
I'm not walking, Adso.
I'm down here.
Is that you up there?
Where are you, boy?
I'm lost!
Well, Adso...
...it would appear that we're in a labyrinth.
Are you still there?
Yes.
How will we get out?
With some difficulty...
...if at all.
You see, Adso, that is the charm of a labyrinth.
Adso, stay calm.
Open a book and read aloud.
Leave the room you're in and keep turning left.
"Love does not originate as an illness...
...but is transformed into it when it becomes obsessive.
The Muslim theologian
Ahmed Hasim states...
...that the lovesick person does not want to be healed...
...and his dreams cause irregular breathing and quicken the pulse.
He identifies amorous melancholia with lycanthropy...
...a disease that induces wolflike behavior in its victims.
The lover's outward appearance begins to change.
Soon his eyesight fails, his lips shrivel...
...his face becomes covered with pustules and scabs.
Marks resembling the bites of a dog appear on his face...
...and he ends his days by prowling graveyards...
...at night...
...like a wolf."
Master, I can see a lantern.
Don't move.
Stay where you are.
I can see a man.
He stopped.
What is he doing?
He's raising his lantern.
How many times?
Three times.
It is I. Raise your lantern.
Look! There!
You foolish boy.
It's only a mirror.
Master!
- The books, boy! Save the books!
- I'm trying to save you!
A trap door and a mirror.
We must be almost there.
If I have deciphered the instructions...
...of the Greek translator correctly...
You did not think me so foolish...
...as to surrender our parchment to the abbot without making a copy?
"Manus supra idolum, age primum et septimus de quatuor" is what?
"With the hand above the idol...
...press the first and the seventh of four."
Very good.
What idol?
That is what we're here to find out.
And the first and the seventh of four what?
If I had the answers to everything,
I'd be teaching theology in Paris.
And again.
Do you hear that?
- It's my teeth, master.
- What?
My teeth.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not afraid. I'm cold.
Oh. Well, we shall return.
Don't leave on my account.
No, no, no. I must confess, it eludes me for the moment.
Now, let me see...
To find your way out of the labyrinth...
...when you come to a fork, you mark it with an arrow... No, no, no. No.
Master?
Please, dear boy. I'm thinking.
- lf there are arrows at the forks...
- Master!
Well done, boy!
Your classical education serves us well.
Thank you.
Lucifer, be at my service.
Lord Bernardo, look what we found!
Search the creature.
My lord abbot, you invited me to investigate the presence...
...of the evil one in your abbey...
And I have already found it.
How many times have I seen these objects of devil worship:
The black cockerel and the black cat?
But she did it for the food, not the devil.
William of Baskerville must surely recall the trial he presided over...
...in which a woman confessed to having intercourse with a demon...
...in the form of a black cat.
I'm very sure that you don't have to draw on my past experiences...
...to formulate your conclusions,
Lord Bernardo.
No, indeed. Not when faced with such irrefutable evidence.
A witch! A seduced monk!
Satanic rites!
Tomorrow...
...we endeavor to learn if these events are connected...
...with the even graver mystery that afflicts your abbey.
Lock them up that we may all sleep safely tonight.
You said... You said nothing.
I said nothing...
...because there was nothing to be said.
You're ready enough to speak the truth...
...when it comes to books and ideas.
She is already burnt flesh, Adso.
Bernardo Gui has spoken.
She is a witch.
But that's not true, and you know it.
I know.
I also know that anyone who disputes the verdict of an inquisitor...
...is guilty of heresy.
You seem to know a lot about it.
Oh, yes.
Won't you tell me...
...as a friend?
Well, there's not much to tell.
I too was an inquisitor...
...but in the early days, when the Inquisition strove to guide...
...not to punish.
And once I had to preside at the trial of a man...
...whose only crime was to have translated a Greek book...
...that conflicted with the holy scriptures.
Bernardo Gui wanted him condemned as a heretic.
I acquitted the man.
Then Bernardo Gui accused me of heresy for having defended him.
I appealed to the pope.
I was put in prison...
...tortured...
...and I recanted.
What happened then?
The man was burned at the stake.
And I am still alive.
Brother Salvatore...
...these torments will cause me as much pain as you.
But you can put an end to them before we even begin.
Open the gates of your heart.
Search the depths of your soul.
Search.
I search!
I search. I search.
Then tell me...
...who, among your brethren...
...is the heretic responsible for these murders?
Me don't know nothing.
Did I lie awake that night suffering for the girl or for myself?
I did not know.
With the dawn came the envoys of the pope...
... our adversaries in the forthcoming debate.
But it meant so little to me now.
Your Eminence, venerable brothers...
...at last we meet for this long-awaited debate.
We have all journeyed great distances in order to put an end to the dispute...
...that has so gravely impaired the unity of our Holy Mother Church.
Good people throughout Christendom...
...are directing their gaze at these venerable walls...
...anxiously awaiting our answer to the vexed question:
Did Christ...
...or did he not...
...own the clothes that he wore?
Beloved brethren of the Franciscan order.
Our Holy Father, the pope, has authorized me and these, his faithful servants...
...to speak on his behalf.
The question is not whether Christ was poor...
...but whether the church should be poor.
You Franciscans wish to see the clergy renounce its possessions...
...and surrender its riches...
...the abbeys dissipate their sacred treasures...
...and hand over their fertile acres to the serfs...
I found the book.
I found it in the dispensary.
A book in Greek was hidden behind one of my jars.
Don't touch it.
Return. Lock yourself inside.
I'll be there just as soon as I can.
Thereby depriving the church of the resources needed...
...to combat unbelievers and wage war on the infidel.
You forget that even the greatest monument to our Lord...
...is but a pale reflection of his infinite majesty and glory...
...far outstripping the church...
Quick, Father, quick.
Salvatore has confessed to his radical past, and yours.
You have but little time to escape the flames.
Thank you, brother.
Where are you going?
Let me go. I'm the cellarer.
Come with us!
You call the pope's province
"God's palace on earth"?
Answer that!
They are a sign that reconciliation...
The gospels state categorically that Christ possessed a purse.
That is a lie! You know it!
The Lord commanded his disciples on no less than seven occasions:
- "Carry neither gold..."
- Venerable brothers!
Brethren, if you please!
A matter has occurred of the utmost gravity.
Let me go!
I swear, I didn't kill him!
I was at the granary taking the inventory!
I never killed anyone!
I swear it!
Then explain to us the purpose of your escape.
I was...
I had already ordered your arrest on other charges.
I see now that I was correct.
Had someone else not chosen to look in the wrong direction...
...several men of God might still be with us.
"To use vulgar persons.
Take pleasure from their defects."
Please, dear boy.
I am trying to think!
So am I, master. So am I!
Then try using your head instead of your heart...
...and we might make some progress.
A book's more important than people to you?
Did I say that they were?
You never seem to care about anyone.
Couldn't you at least show a little pity?
Perhaps that is the style of my pity.
But pity won't save her from the fire.
I remind all present that they are bound by their vow of obedience...
...and on pain of excommunication...
...to aid the inquisitor in his painful struggle against heresy.
To sit with me on this tribunal...
...and to share the burden of the verdict...
...I will require the counsel of two fellow judges.
My lord abbot...
...and...
...Brother William of Baskerville.
Salvatore.
Salvatore.
Salvatore...
...will you repeat your confession of last night?
That you and your accomplice,
Remigio de Varagine...
...were members of the heretical Dolcinites?
Thank you.
Thank you.
- You forgive me.
- Enough!
Remigio de Varagine, do you deny the confession of your accomplice?
No.
I don't deny it.
I'm proud of it!
For the 12 years I lived here...
...I did nothing but stuff my belly...
...shag my wick...
...and squeeze the hungry peasants for tithes.
But now you have given me the strength...
...to remember what I once believed in with all my heart...
...and for that, I thank you.
To remember that you wantonly looted and burned the property of the church?
Yes! To give it back to the people...
...you stole it from in the first place.
And did you not also slaughter many bishops and priests?
Yes!
And I'd butcher you people if I had half the chance!
Holy Mary, Mother of God, hear my humble prayer.
I know that my sin was very great...
...but I beg of you...
...do not let her suffer for my wrongdoing.
Blessed Mother...
...many years ago, you granted a miracle by saving my master.
Will you not do the same for this girl?
My master says that the simple folk always pay for all.
But please, Holy Mother, do not let it be so.
Guilty is that witch...
...who has seduced a monk...
...and has practiced her diabolical ritual within this hallowed place.
Guilty is Salvatore...
...who has confessed to his heretical past...
...and was caught in flagrante delicto with a witch!
Guilty is Remigio de Varagine...
...who, in addition to being unrepentant of his heresies...
...was caught attempting to escape after murdering Severinus.
That's a lie!
I never killed the herbalist or anyone else in this abbey!
I therefore request you...
...to confirm my sentence, my lord abbot.
My heart is filled with sorrow...
...but I can find no reason to contest...
...the just sentence of the Holy Inquisition.
And you, William of Baskerville?
Yes.
He is guilty.
Guilty of having, in his youth...
...misinterpreted the message of the gospels.
And he is guilty of having confused...
...the love of poverty with the blind destruction of wealth and property.
But, my lord abbot, he is innocent of the crimes...
...that have bathed your abbey in blood.
For Brother Remigio cannot read Greek.
And this entire mystery...
...hinges on the theft and possession of a book written in Greek...
...and hidden in some secret part of the library.
Since the verdict of the Inquisition has been disputed...
...we are obliged to extract the prisoner's confession to murder.
Take him to the forge and show him the instruments.
I'll confess anything you want...
...but don't torture me.
I can't live through it, not like Salvatore.
Very well.
Why did you kill them?
Why?
I don't know why.
- Because you were inspired by the devil?
- Yes.
That's it. I was inspired by the devil.
I am inspired by the devil!
Adrammelech, Lucifer,
I summon you, lords of hell!
Alastor!
Azazel!
The shepherd has done his duty...
...and the infected sheep must now be consigned to the purifying flame.
You may burn Brother Remigio...
...but you will not stop the crimes being committed in this abbey.
Other monks will meet their deaths here...
...and they also will have blackened fingers...
...and blackened tongues!
Your Eminence, I beg of you.
We Franciscans are appalled by Brother William's outburst.
Again, we have seen that your theories...
...protect heretics and lead to murder.
- The debate is concluded.
No.
It seems Brother William of Baskerville has relapsed...
...into the errors of which he was formerly purged.
Having sought yet again to shield a heretic...
...from just punishment by the Inquisition...
...he will accompany me to Avignon for confirmation of my sentence...
...by His Holiness Pope John.
I'm right.
If only I could find the book and prove that Bernardo Gui was wrong.
But the Antichrist was victorious once more...
... and nothing seemed to be able to hinder him further.
Come.
When the pyres are lighted tonight...
...let the flames purify each of us in his own heart.
Let us return to what was and ever should be the office of this abbey.
The preservation of knowledge.
"Preservation," I say, not "search for."
Because there is no progress in the history of knowledge...
...merely a continuous and sublime recapitulation.
Let us now praise the Almighty...
...that the bloody-eyed and cloven-hoofed Antichrist...
...has been purged from our sacred precincts...
...and our monastery has returned to peace.
It had the power of 1000 scorpions!
He told me.
Who told you? His tongue is black!
His fingers as black as pitch...
...just as Brother William foretold.
Adso!
It's Brother Malachia.
- Malachia?
- Yes, Father, yes.
- Dear God.
Not Malachia!
Will it never end?
Malachia.
Bernardo, William of Baskerville was right.
- He said that...
- Yes! He knew.
Just as I, too, would have known, had I been the murderer.
Find William of Baskerville.
We still can't open the mirror!
Perhaps by pressing the first and seventh letters of "four."
"Four" only has four letters!
- In Latin.
Quatuor, remember?
The inscription above the mirror?
But we have to press above an idol.
Not "idolum," as in the Latin, but "eidolon," as in the Greek.
Meaning "image" or "reflection."
Our reflection.
This way, master.
- No, this way, Adso.
Here, Q. Q and R.
Pray God we're not mistaken.
Come.
Good evening, Venerable Jorge.
I have been expecting you these several days past, William.
You must have flown to this chamber to have reached it ahead of us.
You have discovered many things since your arrival at this abbey...
...but the short route through the labyrinth is not among them.
So now, what is it that you want?
I want to see the book in Greek that you said was never written.
A book entirely devoted to comedy...
...which you hate as much as you hate laughter.
I want to see what is probably the sole surviving copy...
...of the second book of the Poetics of Aristotle.
William, what a magnificent librarian you would have been.
Here is your well-earned reward.
Read it.
Leaf through its secrets.
You have won.
Close, now!
"We shall now discuss the way comedy...
...stimulates our delight in the ridiculous...
...by using vulgar persons and taking pleasure from their defects."
Carry on, William. Read it, read it!
Master, please, we must hurry.
If the light is too dim for you...
...give it to the boy.
I'm sure he can read it.
I would not want my faithful pupil to turn your poisoned pages.
Not without the protection of a glove, such as I am wearing.
The door, quick!
Before he shuts us in!
Push!
Stay, stay!
Shh!
Venerable brother, there are many books that speak of comedy.
Why does this one fill you with such fear?
Because it is by Aristotle.
- Adso, this way.
Do you, Salvatore, renounce the devil and embrace Jesus Christ...
...as your lord and savior?
Do you, Remigio de Varagine, renounce the devil...
...and embrace Jesus Christ...?
What for?
It's better to die fast than to spend the rest of your life in a prison!
The devil I renounce is you,
Bernardo Gui!
Do you renounce the devil and embrace Jesus Christ as your savior?
But what is so alarming about laughter?
Laughter kills fear.
And without fear, there can be no faith.
Because without fear of the devil, there is no more need of God.
But you will not eliminate laughter by eliminating that book.
No, to be sure.
Laughter will remain the common man's recreation.
But what will happen if, because of this book...
...learned men were to pronounce it permissible to laugh at everything?
Can we laugh at God?
The world would relapse into chaos.
Therefore, I seal that which was not to be said...
...and the tomb I become.
That's him!
He was there, behind the arch!
Adso!
Adso!
Adso!
- Master!
- Go on! I insist!
Leave this place at once! I insist!
Please, God, save him.
Hold them back.
Burn the witch!
You dare raise your hands to the church?
Come!
No! You're not going to leave!
All of this is your doing!
My master found the true murderer!
Help me. Quick!
Help me!
Help me! No!
No, no!
Master.
Adso!
I have never regretted my decision...
... for I learned from my master much that was wise and good and true.
When at last we parted company, he presented me with his eyeglasses.
I was still young, he said, but someday they would serve me well.
And, in fact, I am wearing them now on my nose as I write these lines.
Then he embraced me fondly, like a father, and sent me on my way.
I never saw him again and know not what became of him...
... but I pray always that God received his soul and forgave...
... the many little vanities to which he was driven by his intellectual pride.
And yet, now that I am an old, old man...
... I must confess that of all the faces that appear to me out of the past...
... the one I see most clearly is that of the girl...
... of whom I've never ceased to dream these many long years.
She was the only earthly love of my life...
... yet I never knew nor ever learned...
... her name.

He just walked up outta the rain.

I just brought him here.
Do you have a room for him? Yes, 13.

Sure. I don't see why not.
Thanks a lot for bringing him.

My ex-wife.
No, no, Linda, it's nothing like that at all.
If you'd just relax for a minute,
{y:i}- I... I am relaxed.
Two men died here tonight.
No, it wasn't an accident.
Listen, I'll tell you all about it later, all right?
I really gotta go.
{y:i}- Dan, you promised.
Sure. Sure. Saturday night. That'd be fine.

Is this my father?
Ma'am, I wouldn't.
Not yet.
- Let's get it over with.
Yes, that's my father.
What happened?
Oh, some crazy man.
Killed himself in the parking lot right after.
Drugs probably.
Is that it? My father's dead because of some crazy...
The whole thing is under investigation. 
I'll bet.
You've had a hard night, and you've come a long way.
When you feel better,
I'll have some questions.
And maybe some more answers.

Look, Challis,
I'm only the assistant.
Just tell me what you know, Teddy.
Not much. It's taking a while.
The guy was a pile of ashes.
I know the sheriff thinks he was on drugs.
That doesn't make any sense.
I've seen lots of people on drugs and ...
The man was in complete control.
He looked like a businessman.
He had to be one strong businessman. I can tell you that.
You don't pull someone's skull apart without a little lower arm strength. Know, what I mean?
Teddy ... just do me this one favor.
Check this one out yourself.
Now, I can't do that.
It's gotta go through...
- Please.
This thing's really got you.
I've been with that hospital for eight years. Somebody just doesn't walk in...
I'll see what I can do.
No promises.
Thanks. Thanks.
I was always good at moonlighting, wasn't I?
- Oh, the best.
Do you still have that... You do? - Uh-huh.
How you been?
- Okay. You? - Okay.

- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Thanks again.

- Oh Come on, come on. Come on.
What's the matter?
Don't you have any Halloween spirit?
No.
Hi.
- Hello.
My name is Ellie Grimbridge.
I know. 
Dan Challis.
- I know.
One of the nurses told me, I could find you here.
I saw you at the funeral.
Thank you.
I'm sorry about your father.
Did my father say anything to you the night he died?
Yeah. He, uh ...
Yeah.
He said,
"Tell Ellie I love her."
Well ... you're a bad liar, but ... thank you anyway.
- Wait a second.
I saw something that night.
I don't know.
Your father came into the hospital. He ...
I thought he was crazy, out of his mind.
He's hangin' on to a Halloween mask. He wouldn't let it go.
And what he said was...
"They're gonna kill us all."
And in a little while, he was dead.
And I don't know what the hell is goin' on.
Papa really loved this place ...
But business was getting bad.
I suppose you shopped at the new mall like everybody else, huh?
The kids were keeping him going.
They'd come in after school.
He'd let 'em play with stuff right in the aisles like I used to when I was little.
The question is, why would anybody wanna kill Papa?
He was a wonderful man.
He...
I've been doing some detective work.
My father kept excellent records.
"October 18: Merchants council meeting." He was there. I checked.
"October 19: Football game."
He was there too.
"October 20:
Pick up more masks."
Yeah.
That's the kind your father had in his hand.
"October 21:
Dinner with Minnie."
Minnie Blankenship.
He never showed up.
He never called.
You've been busy.
I think my father ran into trouble ... somewhere between here ... and Santa Mira.
Santa Mira?
Where they make those.
-Oh.
- Little place. Not too far away.
Maybe they know something.
I'm not going back to L.A, until I find out what happened to my father.
Linda, I can't get out of it.
I'm really sorry. I ...
{y:i}You're gonna sit around...
- No. It's just a bunch of doctors talking about boring stuff.
{y:i}The kids don't even remember your name!
- Linda, Linda take it easy.
I'll be back to take 'em trick or treating. I promise. 
I'll call...
{y:i}- Tell me where you're going to stay.
- No, I can't remember the name of the hotel. 
I'll call you Monday.
 I gotta go.
{y:i}- Wait a minute!
- Bye.
{Y:i}"We'll be back with more" Dance Party right after these messages.

I think it's the next exit.
- Wait a minute.
Yeah, that's it.
Then we go about ten miles and turn right on 33.
I wanna know, why they put their factory out here in the middle of nowhere.
Listen ...
Santa Mira founded in 1887, farming community.
Grew up around a large dairy.
After World War II ... a wealthy Irishman, Conal Cochran converted it into a toy factory ...
Silver Shamrock Novelties.
Now given over to the manufacture and sale of Halloween masks.
Largest in the world.
Proud community.
Predominantly Irish.
Irish Halloween masks?
In California ... you never know.
I feel like a goldfish.
Company town.
I'm not ready for this.
We need a plan. 
Ok. How about this?
We go back to that gas station ... 
See if they know anything. We could a ... pose as a couple of buyers and maybe rent a couple of rooms in that motel.
That way at least we'd have some place to talk without the whole town watching us. 
Good point.
Good evening to you.
- Say partner a ...
You haven't know is there a vacancy here in this motel?
My wife and I need a place to stay.
You've come to the right place.
It's cozy, it's quiet, and the price is right.
Keep him happy just for a minute.
Shower's good.
Put in new pipes last year.
Any bags?
- Oh, yeah.
Light packers, aren't ya?
We've had a lot of practice.
Ah! There's Mr. Cochran now.
A great man, Conal Cochran.
A true genius.
Daddy!
Watch your driving, honey.
You could've killed that man.
I didn't hurt him! Hey, sorry about that. Glad it didn't hit ya.
And great big thank you for pickin' it up.
You all right? 
No problem.
- Hey, Buddy Kupfer, San Diego.
This is my wife Betty.
Please to meet you.
And right there's Little Buddy.
Is it busted?
- No.
Don't you dare go in the street!
Do you hear me?!
I gotta go.
- I'll be checkin' you in now, sir.
I fiilled out the register. I left $40 under the blotter.
That'd cover it? - Oh, heavens, yes. Thank you, sir.
 Have a pleasant stay.
Mr. Kupfer, I presume?
Your rooms are waiting.
Damn factory! 
Got their orders all screwed up.
Now I have to stay in this dump again!
Oh, that's great.
Hey honey, it's a freebie!
This place is a zoo.
I saw Cochran.
His car, anyway.
And your old man stayed here on the 20th. I was right!
We'll go directly to the factory.
 - Whoa. Hold on. Slow down, slow down. It's getting late.
I could use a drink. 
Let's take our time.
It's okay with you?
To stay, I mean?
Yeah, I think these a ... clothes could probably hold out for at least one more day.
Maybe I ought to get another room.
That would look sort of suspicious, wouldn't it?
What I mean is, if you'd ... feel more comfortable ...
I could sleep in the car.
Be better than this floor, anyway.
Where do you wanna sleep, Dr. Challis?
That's a dumb question, Miss Grimbridge.
{y:i}It's six o'clock ... it's six o'clock ...
{y:i}Curfew.
{y:i}Curfew.
{y:i}All residents of Santa Mira, please clear the streets.
{Y:i}Curfew is now in effect.
{Y:i}Please confine your activities to your own homes.
{y:i}Thank you.
{y:i}Have a very pleasant evening.
Oh, Jesus!
- Mister, I didn't mean to scare you.
Saw that bottle.
Thought it looked pretty heavy.
I ain't got no diseases.
You mind if I have a drink?
Goddamn.
Thank you.
Hey, just a second. You are ...
You have know anything about this Cochran?
Cochran, Cochran?
Do I know anything?
He made Santa Mira what it is today.
Dried up, little pile of nothing.
Let me tell you something, mister.
He brought in every damn one of them factory people from the outside.
You think he'd hire me?
A local boy? 
No way. Turned me down flat.
You haven't got a dollar you can spare, do you?
Thank you.
All I can tell you, mister ... is watch out.
You seen the TV cameras yet?
He's watching you, friend.
I guarantee you that.
Hey, Cochran ..., fuck you.
Fuck you! - Ooh, ooh, shh, easy.
- It's all right all right. It don't matter to me.
He's probably listenin'.
And if he is ...
I got one thing to say.
It's the last Halloween for that lousy factory of his.
Some pretty wild shit goin' on in there.
I ... I heard rumors.
Like what? What'd you hear?
- This year ...
I'm gonna get me ... about a case and a half of Molotov cocktails.
Burn that son of a bitch right down!
Be the last Halloween for them.
Last Halloween.
What?
Fellas, I was just kidding.
You know that ... You know that. Just kidding!
Oh, sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
Are you picking up an order?
Are you picking up an order at the factory?
Oh, yeah. - Oh, I figured.
There's no other reason to be in this godforsaken place.
All I can say is, good luck to both of us.
They may make great masks, but ever since they started big volume business, the little guy has to stand in line.
You know, what I mean?
I gave up ordering by mail. 
But I hate trying to deal with 'em in person.
You can't win.
Oh, you know,
I hate to say anything, but ... the merchandise is slipping.
I mean. My four-year-old was throwing the thing against the wall.
The trademark shouldn't just come right off. 
Yeah, I see what you mean.
By the way ... 
My name's Marge Guttman.
My shop's on Union Square in San Francisco.
You can't miss it. - Okay. - Why don't you look me up?
Yes. Thanks, I will.
- Bye.
{y:i}Hello?
-Teddy. 
I tried you at home.
{y:i}Why would I be at home,
{y:i}when there's something like this cooking? 
{y:i}Get it cooking.
- Got anything?
No. Someone made a colossal boo-boo.
We've been doing an autopsy on part of the car.
C-4 something.
Just plastic and metal shavings.
Two days wasted because somebody mixed up the envelopes.
Where are you calling from?
Santa Mira.
The Rose of Shannon Motel. I'll check back with you tomorrow.
All right, Sherlock.Ciao.
{y:i}* Two more days to Halloween, Halloween, Halloween *
These commercials ...
{y:i}* Two more days to Halloween ... never stops.
Wait.
Aren't you just ... the least bit tired?
No.
Wait. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
How old are you?
Relax. 
I'm older than I look.
What's that?
Who cares?
What the hell was that?
What's going on?
I don't know.
Oh, my God. That must be Marge.
- Who's that? - A lady I met.
Excuse me, I'm a doctor. Please.
I said I'm a doctor.
Don't trouble yourself, sir. 
She'll get the best care money can buy.
Who's in charge of the patient?
Why, Mr. Cochran, of course.
Mr. Cochran, good to see you, sir.
- Good evening, Mr. Rafferty.
It's all over, my friends.
Just a small accident.
The lady's going to get the very best possible treatment. I promise you that.
Where are they taking her?
They're taking her to the factory.
We've the most marvelous facility there for emergency treatment.
What happened?
- Misfire.
No, don't. 
We can't afford to stick out.
Let's just go.
Misfiire?
What the hell were they talking about?
- Something crazy going on here. - You wanna leave?
Yes, very much.
But not until I find out, whether my father went to that factory.
Hello?
Can you talk?
Sure. I just fiinished sifting the ashes.
What do you have? 
{y:i}It's what I don't have, that bothers me.
You know, I'm starting to wonder if some... someone hasn't been tampering with this stuff.
Why?
Well ... that was a hot fire. But there would have to be some bone fragments or teeth or something.
I've got nothing here to indicate, there was ever body at all. 
Just ashes and car parts.
How about you?
Listen Teddy. Do me another favor.
Will you find out everything you can about Conal Cochran?
He runs Silver Shamrock,
{y:i}the Halloween mask people.
Conal Cochran.
All right, but this is gonna cost you some serious dinners when you get back.
I'm always ready for dinner with you.
Liar. Bye.
Bye.
Oh, there must be some mistake, dearie.
Mr. Grimbridge himself picked up that order on the 21 st.
Here's his signature.
Thank you.
Do you remember that transaction?
No ... but you can talk to someone who might.
Oh, Red ... these people lost an order.
Did you load this one?
Sure did. Last week. A man in an old green station wagon.
That's right. Did he say where he was going?
No, ma'am. Headed out to the north. I remember that.
Thank you.
Would you care to make another order, madam?
- No. Let's go.
Well, hey.
How ya doin'?
Buddy Kupfer and family ... here to see Mr. Cochran.
- Yes, Mr. Kupfer. Welcome.
I'll tell Mr. Cochran, you're here.
When do we get to see 'em makin' the masks? 
Real soon, little buddy. - Buddy, my feet are killing me.
- Honey, come on. The fun's just startin'.
I've seen enough. Let's get out of here.
- All right, all right.
Oh wait!
Wait.
Well, so this is Buddy Kupfer and his lovely family.
My friends ...  
Mr. Kupfer has sold more Silver Shamrock masks this year, by far, than anyone else in the country.
And as for my other friends,
Mr. And Mrs...
Smith.
- Smith, of course.
My apologies for that little bit of a disturbance last night, but I want you both to know, that Mrs. Guttman is going to be fine.
She's been flown to a hospital in San Francisco. 
Thank you.
For and a ...
About the confusion over your order.
I'll just tell you one thing... 
A replacement order is being prepared for you absolutely free ...
The whole thing's on me.
Is he incredible or what?
Now. How would you like a guided tour?
Oh, thank you, sir.
 Would it be all right if my friends come along?
Oh ... yes, I was just about to ask them.
If you'd like to?
We'd love to.
Come along.
Come along.
The latex is heated and poured.
After that, it's cooled and poured off.
Then it's all just a matter of trimming, painting and packaging.
Oh, wow, this is it.
Hall of fame time.
What's famous?
You really don't know?
Conal Cochran, the all-time genius of the practical joke.
He invented sticky toilet paper.
Oh, you must know. The dead dwarf gag, the soft chain saw. All his.
No, gee, I didn't know that.
- And before that, he used to make toys.
Remember that? I had one of those when
I was a kid. Used to sit and watch it for hours.
The man has always paid attention to detail.
Are we all together?
- Yeah.
Oh, I want a mask.
Can I have a mask?
Just what I had in mind for you, Little Buddy.
- I want that one.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Look over here.
Those masks haven't been through final processing.
This one has.
There you are.
That's wonderful.
What final process?
- Don't ask me.
Hey, Mr. Cochran, just what is the final process?
I asure you it's just a little bit of this and a little bit of that.
Quality inspection, the seal of approval.
You know, the usual.
And of course ... there's a couple of ... trade secrets.
I'd sure love to take a look.
Oh, sorry.
Not even a peek for your best salesman? Oh, just one little look.
Well you see ...
Part of the inspection process involves ... volatile chemicals, very dangerous. I wouldn't want to put anybody in any danger. - Oh sure, I understand.
Now listen ... I hope you and your family will be able to have breakfast with me tomorrow morning.
I'd like your opinion on some of our sales material.
- My opinion? 
Oh, sure.
Do you know he's one of the richest men in the country?
And he got that way selling cheap gags and Halloween masks.
Oh god, there's hope for us yet.
It's very valuable to me, you know. Your opinion has always meant a great deal to us. - Oh, thank you, sir.
Where's Little Buddy?
- Oh, there he is, running down there.
See him there?
- Oh, yes.
Into everything always.
We like to know everything there is to know.
Like father, like son.
- Oh, yeah.
Excuse me.
Darling?
I think it's time we were going.
See you later.
What's up?
I just saw a couple of men who looked strangely familiar.
And there's another one.
They look a lot like the man, who killed your father.
Oh, my God!
- What?
That's Papa's car. 
Wait, Ellie, Ellie. Don't.
Trade secrets.
I saw it.
I know I saw it.
I think it's time for the marines.
I'm scared. I think we should leave.
All right.
You pack ...
I'll call the police.
This place has to fall under somebody's jurisdiction.
Let's go soon, okay?
- All right, all right.
Hallo.
Operator, this is an emergency. I wanna ...
{y:i}I'm sorry.

Ellie?
Ellie?
Operator.
{y:i}If you'd like to make a call, 
Operator!
{y:i}Please hang up and try again.
{y:i}If you'd like to make a call,
{y:i}please hang up and try again.
{Y:i}If you need help, you have to
{y:i}dial your operator for assistance.
Where's the girl?
Where is she? 
Where is she?
Where is she?!
Oh, Jesus. Je...
Clumsy.
This was a rare piece.
German.
Made in Munich ... 
I must try to get a replacement.
Ah, Mr. Challis.
- Where is Ellie?
Mrs. Smith.
Ah, sure I believe she's resting just now.
Didn't take you long to get here, Mr. Challis.
Dr. Challis, I should say.
It'll be morning soon.
Halloween morning.
It'll be a very busy day for me.
Being a medical man, you should find it quite interesting.
The surprising thing is that the internal components were quite simple to produce, really.
The outer features ... took much longer to perfect. But then, of course in the end it's just another form of mask making.
Bless you.
Convincing, aren't they?
Loyal and obedient, unlike most human beings.
Those who went before me, you know they... they never dreamed of anything like this.
What is this place?
- Oh, can't you tell?
Advanced and... ancient technology.
A good magician never explains.
Come on, then.
You've still got time to figure it out all by yourself.
From an ancient sacrificial circle.
Stonehenge.
We had a time getting it here.
You wouldn't believe, how we did it.
It has a power in it.
A force.
Even a... particle.
Devastating.
Oh, Doctor, you asked about the girl.
Where is she?
Right in there.
And your friend, Miss Guttman.
You killed her.
- Oh, no. Miss Guttman was the victim of a misfire.
The others...
What you really need to see is a demonstration and there's one coming right up.
{y:i}Mr. Cochran will be right along.
{y:i}I don't like this place.I{y:i}it gives me the creeps.
{y:i}I have to go to the bathroom.
Mommy!
- Relax a minute, will you?
Mr. Cochran'll be here.
Then everything will be fine.
He just wants my opinion about some television commercials or something.
You know, I still can't figure out why they won't take my orders for next year.
{Y:i}You know how I like to work ahead,
{y:i}and well, they're just not interested at all.
Maybe they're not going to have Halloween next year.
All right, roll it.
{y:i}It's time, it's time.
{y:i}Time for the big giveaway.
- This is just the same old stuff.
{y:i}All you lucky kids with Silver Shamrock masks,
{y:i}gather 'round your TV set.
{y:i}Put on your masks and watch.
- Honey, don't get too close, you'll ruin your eyes.
Gather 'round and watch.
Watch the magic pumpkin. Watch.
I think this whole thing ... is a big joke.
I mean, look at that.
I mean, look.
Betty.
Honey?
{y:i}* Happy, happy Halloween, Halloween, Halloween *
{y:i}* Happy, happy Halloween, Silver Shamrock. *
{y:i}* Happy, happy Halloween, Halloween, Halloween *
{y:i}* Happy, happy Halloween, Silver Shamrock. *
{Y:i}It's almost time, kids.
The clock is ticking.
{Y:i}Be in front of your TVsets for the "Horrorathon."
{y:i}And during the big giveaway at nine.
{y:i}Don't miss it. 
{y:i}And don't forget to wear your masks.
{y:i}The clock is ticking. It's almost time.
{y:i}* Happy, happy Halloween, Halloween, Halloween *
{y:i}* Happy, happy Halloween, Silver Shamrock. *
{y:i}* Happy, happy Halloween, Halloween, Halloween *
{y:i}* Happy, happy Halloween, Silver Shamrock. *
{y:i}Hurry home. It's almost time.
{y:i}All those lucky kids with Silver Shamrock masks, hurry home for the big giveaway.
{y:i}It's almost time. Hurry home.
{y:i}What city, please?
The number for Santa Mira, the Rose of Shannon Motel, please.
{y:i}555-2462.
Thank you.
{y:i}I'm sorry. We cannot complete your call as dialed.
{y:i}Please hang up and dial again. This is a record ...
{y:i}Hello?
Roger?
Did I wake you?
Oh, sorry.
Listen. I've got something down here
I'd like for you to look at.
{y:i}What?
I know I could be wrong, but I don't think it's a car part at all.
Maybe you've seen something like it.
{y:i}How's tomorrow afternoon?
Tomorrow afternoon?
Okay, great. Thanks, Roger.
Bye.
Oh, my God.
{y:i}May I help you?
Operator, can you get me the sheriff...
Enjoy the "Horrorathon," Doctor.
And don't forget to watch the big giveaway afterwards.
Why, Cochran? Why?
Do I need a reason?
Mr. Kupfer was right, you know.
I do love a good joke. And this is the best ever.
A joke on the children.
But there's a better reason.
You don't really know much about Halloween.
You thought no further than the strange custom of having your children wear masks and go out begging for candy.
It was the start of the year in our old Celtic lands and we'd be waiting ... in our houses of wattles and clay.
The barriers would be down, you see,
Between the real and the unreal.
And the dead might be looking in ... to sit by our fires of turf.
Halloween.
The festival of Samhain.
The last great one took place 3,000 years ago and the hills ran red ... with the blood of animals and children.
Sacrifices.
It was a part of our world ...
Our craft.
Witchcraft.
- To us, it was a way of controlling our environment.
It's not so different now.
It's time again.
In the end ... 
We don't decide these things, you know.
The planets do.
They're in alignment.
And it's time again.
The world's going to change tonight, Doctor.
I'm glad you'll be able to watch it.
And... happy Halloween.
Cochran.
{y:i}- It's just that work ...
Oh, yes, yes, of course.
Tonight's just for fun. A way of saying
"thank you" to all our good customers.
Mr. Cochran.
{y:i}I have good news for you.
{y:i}It'll long just a moment.
It's always a pleasure doing business with you. It is indeed.
A 43 share.
You think so?
Good. And I hope the little ones will be watching.
Don't forget to tell them to watch the big giveaway at 9:00.
Thank you for calling. Good-bye.
{y:i}Thanks. Bye.
Sir?  
Malfunction.
Camera two.
{y:i}Hello?
Linda, Linda... 
{y:i}Where the hell have you been? I waited all night.
Shut up, shut up. Linda, shut up. Listen, listen.
You have to get rid of the masks ... the Silver Shamrock ...
No, no.
{y:i}The ones that I gave them? You want me to what?
In the Santa Mira.
They killed Buddy Kupfer and his whole family.
 They killed him.
{y:i}That's not enough ...
We've lost him.
No, we haven't.
You'll see.
No, no, no, I'm not drunk.
Linda, listen. You have to get rid of the masks.
Just ...
{y:i}You want me to what? 
{y:i}You're just jealous because...
 I'm not. Linda, listen.
{y:i}Go to hell!
Ellie. Ellie. Ellie!
South corridor.
Come on.
Wait here.
{y:i}It's time, it's time.
{y:i}Time for the big giveaway.
{y:i}Halloween has come.
{Y:i}All you lucky kids with Silver Shamrock masks,
{y:i}gather 'round your TVset.
{Y:i}Put on your masks and watch.
{Y:i}All witches, all skeletons, all jack-o'- lanterns gather 'round and watch.
{y:i}Watch the magic pumpkin.
{y:i}Watch ...
{y:i}...in the eastern valley we're expecting overcast sky
{y:i}and 50% chance of rain thru monday.
{y:i}It's presently 74 degrees at ... 
{y:i}8:48 p.m.
{Y:i}The clock is ticking.
{y:i}Hurry home, kids.
{y:i}And happy Halloween.
We've gotta do something, call somebody. Huh?
Ellie, you all right?
Ellie!
Your phone, your phone, where is it? It's life and death.
Hey, don't I know you?
{y:i}* Happy, happy Halloween, Halloween, Halloween ... *
- If it goes out it means a death of millions of people everyone watching. Don't you understand that?
"If"...
Well, say it's a bomb. Say whatever you want.
Say whatever you like. Just get if off the air.
Please! Just ...
No, no! I can't prove it!
You've gotta believe me! Believe me!
Take it off the air now! Please!
You've got to, please.
{y:i}Please excuse the interruption.
{y:i}We're having technical problems.
{y:i}Please stand by.
{y:i}It's time. It's time.
{Y:i}We are experiencing technical difficulties.
{y:i}Please, stand by.
{y:i}Gather 'round your TV set.
{y:i}Put on your masks and watch.
{y:i}All witches, all skeletons, all jack-o'- lanterns ...
{Y:i}The third commercial, it's still on. Please.
Take out the third channel.
The third channel it's still running. Stop it, please.
For God's sake, please stop it.
There's no more time.
You've gotta... Please, stop it.
Stop it now. Turn it off!
 Turn it off!
Stop it!
Stop it! 
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it!
Yeah?
Yeah. Okay, I'll be right down.
Dr. Onaman. Calling Dr. Onaman.
Dr. Benway. Calling Dr. Benway.
Cops pulled him off the beach fifty, twenty minutes ago.
Took 4 of us to get him on the bed.
Strung way out.
We can't even get eye contact.
It's like he thinks we're not even here.
His clothes were blood-soaked...
I mean soaked.
Cleaned him up.
Found a couple of lacerations,
- but what are the rest...
- Is that French?
Sounds like it, but he's too fast for me.
His pupils are constricted, pressure's up, motor stuff's right.
I'm sure it's PCP, but I don't know.
I can't get a needle into him to check.
Now, if I try to sedate him, it could be a real mess.
Look, I know you're new, and I'm sorry to put you on the spot.
But if I sedate him without a neurology, okay, my ass...
Your ass is secure, dear, okay?
Just go and see if you can find someone who speaks French.
Oh, and maybe a priest.
He's probably catholic.
Well, what happened to you, then?
We stopped him going across the park by the palisades.
By the time we...
- Get back! Get back down there!
- Stop. He'll tear his wrists.
Do me a favor and wait outside.
Outside, please.
- You, too. A.J.
- A.J.
- But somebody's got to...
- Outside, okay?
Boy, you've been in quite a scrape, haven't you?
Quite a scrape.
What happened to you, hmm?
What happened?
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
- Are you all right?
- Look out. Coming through.
Anyone else?
Call for Dr. Rodriguez right away!
Be careful. Be careful.
Gently, please. Gently.
- I guess he got me.
- Jesus Christ, he's dead.
Makes tonight look like... nursery school.
I'll pass, thanks. This weekend
I've got a date with my apartment.
Don't ever try and move and work at the same time.
Well, that is what wives are for.
Mmm.
You gonna miss the east?
Well, there are a lot of university people, but...
But what?
I don't know. I suppose they were more my husband's friends than mine.
At some level, this going-west business appeals to me.
Swab that, please, nurse.
Oh, you know what I do miss, though?
Trees.
It's so barren. You get the feeling that every last bush has been installed.
It's like Disneyland or something.
Well, people don't realize that this is a city built on a desert.
Just try to think of it as extended parking for the beach.
What? Ow!
Hold on. Just a couple more, we'll be through.
Ooh.
On these hours, who gets to go to the beach?
Last one. There we go.
- Do you want it dressed?
- Leave it uncovered.
How long have you been on duty?
Uh...
32 hours. 4 more to go.
All right. That's it, then.
And you have had enough excitement for one night.
So, I want you to go home, get some sleep, and those are surgeon's orders.
Besides, you're too old for this career stuff.
You should be home taking kids to get their teeth straightened.
See that, nurse? See that?
They turn 30 and everything is sex, sex, sex.
Listen, you need a tetanus booster?
All right. Then get out of here and go home.
- Good night, doctor.
- Go.
- Good night. Thanks.
- Good night.
I'll catch you later.
What'd he say, anyway?
Who?
The guy who jumped you. What'd he say?
Nothing.
Hmm.
That's a pity. Last thing a man says is supposed to be significant.
This is Dr. Collins' office.
I'll try you at the hospital.
Hello, Mrs., uh...
Dr. Flax, this is Mr. Hendricks from the telephone company.
We'll have an installer in your area tomorrow afternoon...
What are you doing?
I thought it was funny, too.
No sense of humor.
This son of a bitch gets out of his car... looks about 14 years old, and he's got a beer belly already... gets out of his car carrying a tire iron.
- No kidding.
- Honest.
What'd you do?
Got the hell out of there.
What the fuck else?
But, fuck, man, there are more crazy, meshugina lunatics running around...
What did you do at Radcliffe, major in sailors?
I wish.
You know your nutcase from last night?
Well, the lab report came back this morning.
No drugs.
Adrenal residue enough to frizz a horse, but no dope.
I wonder what happened to him.
Looked like some creep off the beach, right?
Yeah.
The man was an anthropologist from UCLA.
Spoke half a dozen languages, lived all over the world, and was, apparently, a very famous individual.
Jesus.
What kind of people did he study, anyway?
I don't know.
This morning in Richter's office,
I got a look at his wife.
She's this elegant-looking redhead.
Just the opposite of what he looked like.
And the crazy thing about it is they've only been in the country a week.
- Well, I got a minute flat to get to 7.
- Walk in backwards.
I tried that. I promised
I'd actually be there this time. Eileen.
Hey. Hey, quit it.
- Hmm?
- Your lip.
If you don't quit chewing on it, it'll look like your ear.
Hey, Eileen, are you okay?
Oh, sure.
Cassie, what does, um...
N'y sont pas...
sont des innois mean?
Uh...
Shit. N'y sont pas...
They are not there. They are...
- Sont des innois.
- Sont des innois.
Sounds like a place. I don't know. Why?
Dr. Wayne, please call the operator.
...walking right now is the best thing for you.
Tomorrow I want to hear that you've been... right...
Dr. Stafford's on in the morning.
Do you want me to order a repeat EEG for her?
No.
The carpet's fine. I like the color.
What?
The old carpet was yellow, but the owners didn't...
Doctor, I think we skipped...
Doctor?
The owner was only here for a little while, but they did a good deal to the house.
There's so many things.
For instance, the old carpet was yellow, and it didn't clean very well, so they put in all new ones.
The house is only 4 blocks from the beach.
And, of course, there's plenty of storage space.
Obviously, I tried to convince the owners to stay here long enough to sell instead of rent, but apparently his transfer was pretty sudden, and they just upped and left.
What do you think, huh?
I admit that science is not my strong suit, but anthropology... that's bones and tombs and things.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Nothing so dramatic.
My work is cultural. I...
Je l'adore!
At least it's warm, eh?
I, uh...
I mostly watch people.
Oh! But I thought you were teaching here this fall.
- Uh, yes, I'm afraid that is so.
- Oh, listen to him.
The first civilized place we live in years, and already he's bored.
Goddamn freaks.
I'm fine. I'm fine, I'm fine!
Leave me alone! I'm fine! Stop it!
Stop it! I'm fine.
Just fine.
What's he gotten into?
Da da da da da! I got the material.
Ah, hold it, hold it, hold it.
I got the material, but you will have to help me with the...
Comment dit?
- Trigle de rideau?
- Curtain rod.
Ah! Curtain rod. Curtain rod.
Curtain rod.
I forget English faster than I learn, huh?
- It will come. It will come.
- Alors. Tell me.
Which one do you like best, huh?
This one?
Ah... On you or the living room?
For the living room, this.
For when we live in the land rover, this.
Oh, no. Cochon.
Ooh. I forgot about her.
Mm-hmm.
- Johnny?
- Mm-hmm?
You are not really bored, are you? Huh?
Pas du tout. Pas du tout.
I'm looking forward to it.
I'm looking forward to water we did not have to carry.
I am looking forward to working 5-hour days.
I am going to get food in supermarket wrapped in plastic.
I am going to get hamburger
commes les Americains.
Alors, maintenant, je suis americain, eh?
Americain. Americain.
Americain.
Americain.
- Mr. America.
- Mm-hmm. Oui.
- Which one of these is you? Hmm?
- Where did you get that, Niki?
Give me that photograph!
Niki! Come here!
- No! No.
- Niki! Give me the photograph.
- No. No. No.
- Niki. Come. Come, come.
Come on, Niki...
We will mount it over the mantelpiece
commes les Americains!
Give it, give it, give it, give it!
- No!
- Give it, give it!
Your mother give it to me a long time ago.
It was in storage.
We had never a mantle to put it on.
I have given you a hard life, hey?
Rien.
No more.
No more.
Oh! No, no, no, no!
We will be unpacking until October!
- I can't wait till October!
- You won't have to.
Ah, come. We have a new house.
We should pretend we are just married, eh?
Don't give me presents, huh?
When we first marry, you were following seal hunters, and when you come home, you smell like them.
- I don't smell like them now, eh?
- No, no, no.
I don't smell like them now.
Tell me I don't smell like them now.
Did you bring the last two box, the dishes?
- Ah, tout de suite. Tout de suite. Yes.
- Allez, allez. Oh, I will get them.
No, no, no. It's not necessary.
I will go. I will go. I'm going.
My love.
I'm going. I'm going.
What are you doing?
We've got a hemorrhage here.
Niki, go upstairs, please.
Go upstairs. Go. Niki, go, now, please.
"...Surprise thief."
"Parents find mutilated bodies of children."
"Parents who had moved here to begin a new life
"returned to find that life... seeping into..."
Mon dieu. La Maison les attire.
- What?
- La Maison les attire.
They're attracted to the house.
What the hell is she talking about?
You're right. It's worse.
Judy, darling, would you see if you can dig me up the night service number for data general, please?
All right, what do you got, fellas?
Well, there's no evidence of trauma.
But I think we wanna run another series in the morning.
Come on, come on, come on.
What's going on?
It's fakacht, that's all.
We're getting screwy numbers.
We gotta get the techies in there and rip it apart.
Talk to me, Ted. Come on.
Well, the first time through was faint and only showed autonomic functions.
Then we started getting cortical propagation!
- I don't understand.
- Well, neither do we.
But this is the brain function of a person who's wide awake.
Look, just get Mrs. Lachman or whatever her name is...
Active. Hearing. Seeing.
Walking around talking to people.
You knew she just did say something in there,
- and it was in French.
- And?
And the crazy who jumped her the other night was a Frenchman.
So... she had a run-in with a crazy.
I mean, this city is full of crazies, guys.
They pull four bodies a day just off the freeways.
Listen to me. I'm gonna tell you what we're gonna do.
We're gonna put her in a room for the night, we're gonna fix the eco, we're gonna run some tests...
What is funny about it?
There are some very strange people in this world.
What is that?
It is nothing.
It is nothing at all. I promise.
Hey, hey, hey. Come now.
Come, come, come, come.
Huh? Don't worry about it all.
I will repaint it in the morning.
- What are you going to do about it?
- What should I do, eh?
Call the police and say children have painted my door, come quickly?
I'm going to bed.
Would you care to join me?
I don't think it was children.
Well, children come in all shapes and sizes.
What kind of people would do that, huh?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Come. Let's go to bed, huh?
- Is the door locked?
- Yes, the door is locked, and the back door is locked, and the drawbridge, it is raised for the night.
Now... if you want to worry, you can do it in the morning.
Tonight there are more important things to think about.
Is it October so soon?
Oui. Nearly November.
Les feuilles tombent.
The leaves... are falling...
Yes... every little...
Et des vents froids soufflent...
- And the cold winds blow...
- Are blowing.
Et bientot, de grandes hampes de glace se leveront...
And soon great shafts of ice will...
Ooh! I like ice.
- Bitch.
- Je n'suis pas une bitch.
Je serais une bourgeoise.
I am going to be madame Pommier, wife du professeur, avec le suntan.
And you should take care...
Hey, where are you going?
I'm, uh... I'm going to get a glass of wine.
- Ooh, get me one, too.
- Of course.
- Johnny?
- Oui?
Tout va bien?
I'll be right back. I'll be right back.
Don't worry.
What kind of people?
I'm going out.
Well...
I can see that.
I won't be long.
I'm just going to go down the street.
Oui, oui.
What are you after?
Ah...
Uh... nothing. Something, something.
I don't know. I'm not sure.
We'll talk later, okay?
I really won't be long. I promise.
Jean-Charles!
Oui.
- Keep the door locked.
- Oui. Allez. Merci. Allez!
Johnny?
Jean-Charles!
Johnny?
What do you mean, she's gone?
I came in to check her and she wasn't in the bed and I thought...
- maybe she was in the bathroom.
- I only left 40 fuckin' minutes ago!
Doctor, please. We put her across from the nursing station deliberately.
We've searched the floor, we've got the security people going through the rest of the building.
It's only a matter of time before we find her.
There's no way she could've gotten out of here without one of us seeing.
Hey, stop!
Stop!
Okay.
Salaud! Tu said depuis combien du temps?
Stop. Stop, stop, stop!
Hush, hush!
Quest-que c'est ca? Celles le libre?
Yes, I know about them.
That's why I went out.
I wanted to know what kind of people...
Will you stop?
Will you stop?
Yes, I know about them!
And yes, I didn't tell you because
I wanted to know what kind of people could think of a murder as some sort of shrine.
Will you listen to me?
I spent 30 hours following people who do not live anyplace.
脠coute moi? Do not work anyplace.
I called the government, the state, their vehicle, it is not registered.
- Why do you tell me this?
- Don't you understand?
They're nomads.
- What?
- Nomads. Nomads, yes.
Like all of them. Like every place we've lived for the last 10 years.
- Here?
- Yes, here, now. In this city.
In the middle of a modern city.
They go from one party to the next, one restaurant, one gas station, one motel.
These people live in parking lots!
In 30 hours, they did not stop moving.
Don't you understand what I'm saying?
And I didn't...
I didn't call you and I didn't tell you because
I didn't want to frighten you.
I should have called.
There was no reason.
Forgive me. Please, forgive me.
Forgive me. I'm very tired.
Very tired.
None of this may mean anything.
None of it at all.
I may have simply...
But I may have found people who are living outside.
Outside any structure.
They do not participate.
No exchanges, no constraints.
They resort to violence at no provocation, and they get away with it.
It is as if to the official world they did not exist.
I don't know. I don't know.
- You are a crazy man.
- Huh.
You know that?
I was so worried about you.
You look awful.
Awful. Awful.
Why do you push yourself so hard, huh?
You have not done this in a long time.
There is a roll of film I must see.
Awful.
Phone's ringing.
She told me she was a doctor.
How am I supposed to know?
She is a doctor.
- Yeah, hello?
- Hi, I'm sorry...
Oh, Christ, she's got a machine!
Hey, hey! Find the fucking machine!
Don't hang up, okay? Hang on!
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
Wait for the beep.
- Yeah, hello?
- Hi, Eileen, I got the stuff...
No, no, no, this isn't Eileen.
This is a friend who's been look...
Um, Eileen isn't in at the moment.
Can I take a message?
- Sorry, she called me...
- You spoke to her?
Mm-hmm. She called yesterday.
She asked about something and I wanted to get back to her.
- Have you got a pencil?
- Yeah, uh, go ahead.
Okay, tell her that des innois
is not a place,
at least not one we could find,
and no one around here seemed to think it had anything to do with anthropology.
- There was, however...
- Eileen asked you about this?
Mm-hmm. There was, however,
an eskimo word... Inuat...
It's pretty farfetched, but...
Oh, look, I'm sorry,
I shouldn't impose all this on you.
Have Eileen call me at area...
No, no, no! Where are you? Are you here?
- Pardon me?
- Where are you? Are you out here?
- I'm in Boston, why?
- Um...
Look, just tell me, I'll get the gist of it for her. Do you mind?
No, uh...
It's apparently some sort of nomad myth.
It has to do with wandering in the desert.
- I thought you said it was eskimo.
- Well, it's all the same.
Nomads live in deserts, whether it's a desert of ice or sand
or whatever... doesn't make any difference.
Apparently, the eskimos spend a good deal of time wandering on the ice....
- Looks like she's been packing.
- ...and the Inuat...
There's another one over here.
Look, why don't you look in the bathroom and see if her toiletries are still there?
I'm sorry, did you say...
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
Oh, nothing, I'm sorry.
Um... and the inuat were...
Well, they were supposedly hostile spirits.
According to the myth, they were capable of assuming human form.
They, uh... here, wait a second.
Uh, "thought to inhabit places of past calamity.
"They brought disaster and madness to any humans who fell in with them.
"Only a myth, of course, but observers well into the 20th century
"marked how cautiously older eskimo approached strangers on the ice."
Hello?
That's all we could find, I'm afraid.
I don't know if that answers her question or not.
Well, anyway, be sure and tell her we all miss her,
and if she gets tired of all that sunshine, she's welcome back, all right?
Yeah. I'll tell her.
N'y sont pas.
Sont des inuat.
They're not there.
They're inuat.
- Did Charlie say anything?
- No.
Crap.
Ugh! Crap.
It's crap, crap, crap. Double crap.
Middle of the night listening to bullshit nonsense.
It's not my own life.
Honest to God, Jesus.
Shit.
Ca doit s'expliquer.
Ca doit s'expliquer. Il le faute.
Crazy son of a bitch!
I have a light here if you prefer.
They've shut off the power at this end of the building, I'm afraid.
It's only a small savings, of course.
But then again, in my case it's also... a small sacrifice.
I keep this lantern for visitors.
However, there've been few of those of late.
Oh, forgive me, please. I, uh...
Forgive me for being so rude. I...
I did not think that, uh...
You'll be forgiven for thinking the building abandoned.
Ah, yes. Yes, I... Yes, I did.
The handyman has, like so much of the world, grown somewhat lax.
It wasn't always like this, of course.
But now with only me here, why, I suppose it's a small matter.
You are... you are here alone?
Oh, I'll be following the others, eventually.
For now, I have been left here to look after things, as it were.
Though I'm not certain they saw the humor in it.
Oh, dear, now I'm being rude.
You may call me Bertril.
How do you do? Ah, I'm...
Mr. Pommier, yes.
Won't you have tea?
I haven't any lemon. But...
I trust that's all right.
They're usually so regular about sending the boy around with groceries.
I can't imagine what happened.
Oh!
But perhaps I've got the days muddled again.
Oh, not that way, Mr. Pommier.
- In here, if you will.
- You know about them, don't you?
There are places with pasts, Pommier.
Places with secrets.
Things... collect.
You just looked too closely.
Most people are luckier.
They never know that a certain percentage of what they see... is not there.
But the problem now is not what you know, it's what they know.
Yes?
You.
They know about you.
Go away, Pommier.
Leave your house and change your job. Go and hide yourself.
You can still survive this, but you must not try to fight them.
Listen to me. If you've never run from anything in your life, run from this.
- They're leading you into another world.
- They're not real. They can't do anything.
They brought you here, Pommier.
- What was this place? What happened here?
- You must leave now.
Don't pursue this.
It won't end with you, you know.
Go, do as I say.
For the sakes of those you'll lead them to.
Un cauchemar, un cauchemar, un cauchemar, un cauchemar.
I'm dreaming.
I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming.
Just dreaming. I'm just dreaming.
Very bad, very bad.
Tired... just tired.
Mmm.
What are you looking at?
You come up here late last night.
You seemed very ill.
You also seemed to know a lot about my husband.
- What is it?
- I'm... embarrassed.
You sleep on the couch.
You were with, um... my husband when he's dead, no?
I am Veronique Pommier.
I know your name, Niki.
I know your name! I know, I've seen!
No, no, rest calm. You're just tired.
Why don't we go out today, huh, and be like tourists?
Ca serait pas mal, no?
No! No, I don't want to go!
Don't make me go! Don't leave me! No!
Ooh, la... It goes forever.
No! I don't want to go!
Please stay away from me.
Please! Please!
Go where? Where don't you want to go?
He tried to tell me something and I couldn't understand.
He screamed...
His whole memory is in my head and I...
I don't understand.
I don't know what he wants.
They're... hounding him, and I don't know what he wants.
Who? Who is doing that?
He thinks they're inuat.
That is what he meant.
How do you know this?
I was so frightened last night.
You were shaking.
Did you ever have a dream and not know when it started?
The old man on Atavak used to tell a tale of the dangers of travelling far, of hunting alone on the ice.
How one might no longer know what was... real.
We are so very far from home, you know.
All of us.
We have wandered so very far from home.
Please, stop.
It is not important. I was tired, eh?
I was tired, very tired.
I was stupid and went two days without sleep, hmm?
C'est fini, tout fini.
We should talk about our new life, eh?
Our bourgeois life in this civilized place.
Talk of things we planned, huh?
There'll be time enough for that.
Oui.
Oui, oui.
Again?
You're wrong, you know.
He cares more for you than anything in the world.
Did Jean-Charles have any history of emotional problems?
- No!
- Please.
- Mais non.
- Please, anything.
- Was there anything in his family?
- No.
- Was he taking drugs?
- No.
Drinking?
Was there any radical change in his diet?
Hamburgers wrapped in plastic.
Did my husband lose his sanity?
I think so.
He's hallucinating.
Was hallucinating.
Hello?
Oh, thank God, you are there.
Are you all right?
I think so.
We've been going out of our minds here.
We even had the cops out.
Eileen, I went to your apartment last night, and some guy on the phone laid some weird rap on me about people who weren't really people?
Well, it spooked the shit out of me.
Who the fuck was it anyway?
Oh, a friend, a friend back east.
What was that stuff about?
I'm not sure.
It doesn't matter now anyway.
We'll talk.
Well, it scared the fuck out of me.
Listen, I've got the address and I'm gonna come pick you up.
Eileen?
What?
I said I'm gonna come pick you up.
Oh, Cassie, I'm not sure you should.
Bullshit. I'll be there in a few minutes.
Niki.
What did he do then?
You don't know?
You were on the tower and you looked at him and you said, "qu'est ce que tu as?"
And he was shaking... what did you do then?
We left that place very fast.
He took me to a hotel and told me to stay there.
And keep the door locked until he come back.
But he never come back.
Here.
The next day I come here and... everything is so strange.
I find two suitcases.
One was on the bed there... and the other was... the other one was there.
Yes.
He was running.
He was taking the old woman's advice and he was running but something wouldn't let him... get away, wouldn't let him out.
- Oh, Niki, what if he wasn't...
- Wasn't what?
What if he wasn't insane?
No, thanks. I don't want any.
No, look, I mean it. I don't want any, so go bug somebody else, okay?
Listen, sweetheart, I said I don't want any flowers so move your butt.
Move!
Hey, get out of my fucking car!
Get the fuck out of my car!
No! We've got to get out of here now.
If they knew about Jean-Charles, they know about us.
And we shouldn't be here.
Either of us.
- You know where everything is.
- Depeches toi... il n'y a plus de temps.
You can't come back here.
Ever.
Ever.
But we've got to get out of here now.
Now.
- Oh!
- Leave it, leave it, go.
Who are these people?
Who are these people?
Who are they?
Oh, God. You see them, too.
Operator, I need the police.
The address is...
Up this way!
Help me! Help me!
Help me!
No!
No!
You saw what happened to Jean-Charles, no?
Tell me.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
But they'll be back.
Come on.
Okay, let go, let go.
Tell me.
Don't stop.
No matter what you see, don't stop.
Don't stop! Don't stop!
Good morning, it's Eye On L.A.
Photography, modeling and pumping iron.
Are they combining into a new kind of soft porn?
This morning, Eye On L.A. looks into this phenomenon.
There are those legitimate photographers, like Harry Langdon...
...and then there are those photographers right on the edge.
We'll be talking to the controversial
Bobby Korshack...
...who's had his legal difficulties in the past...
...run-ins with the local authorities over films he called art...
...and others called obscene.
Korshack's magazines have hurt legitimate publications.
In fact, some have been removed from supermarket checkout counters...
...because of their covers. Is he, as he says, "glorifying the new female form...
...just like Ziegfeld"?
Or is he still, as he's been called by his detractors, the king of sleaze?
We'll be hearing from the models, the agents, the publishers.
But first, let's meet the always-controversial Bobby Korshack.
Okay, Mr. Korshack, you're considered by some as the king of porn.
How long have you been doing this?
I've been...
I've been into it for about three years.
- Has it been profitable so far?
- I always do well.
I see.
Mr. Korshack, this fashion of female muscle-building...
...how prevalent do you think it's going to become?
I think it's- I think it's the new wave.
I think it's an era that-
It's worldwide. It's really important.
It deals with health.
I've been told that you and other men find these muscle women...
What the fuck?
What do you think they look like in clothes?
Ordinary. Detestable.
Mr. Korshack, you knew we'd be getting around to this eventually.
It's no secret you've had problems in the past with...
...shall we say, well, some very sexually explicit photographic work.
- Do you regret any of that now?
- No, I see growth. I actually do.
It's...
We all come from somewhere.
I've tried different avenues.
I'm not ashamed of what I've done, and I'm proud of what I am doing now.
To expand on that a little bit...
...I've tried different avenues, from acting...
Wait a minute.
...working in some of the films of friends- None of this stuff is released.
But...
- ... it brings me to this point now...
- Hey!
...where I'm doing very well.
What are you trying to pull?
In your opinion, Mr. Korshack...
...do you feel film or still photography represent a woman at her sexiest?
Is that one of those trick-?
Great.
God.
Only a story...
You were an actor for some time.
Did your acting experience help you as a photographer?
Oh, very much, very much.
Really, still photography is like acting, just in short moments.
My ability as a photographer in bringing something out...
...to bring that moment out in these people...
...to be sensitive to them and to understand really helps a great deal.
I've been on both sides of the camera.
- Are the models sensitive?
- Very sensitive.
You gotta be very careful and treat them as human beings and not objects.
As an actor I understand that.
I've been able to work with them and get the best out of them.
They've got a lot to offer.
Mr. Korshack, do you think these girls will be replacing...
...what was thought of in the past as the conventional type?
Well, I think these women are all beautiful.
Congratulations.
It's 9:30, and I'm on my way, but I'll be at-
Can it wait?
- I'm doing this slalom over the canyon.
- I gotta talk to you.
- Jacky!
- Right here.
- What happened last night?
- Christ, you start early.
- What are you boozing for at 10 a. m.?
- Breakfast of champions.
Jacky, please, come on.
What happened?
- You fucked up again.
- What do you mean? How?
- I don't remember a damn thing.
- You're really something, girl.
- You draw a blank whenever you-
- What did I do?!
Do?
All right. I talked to a client of mine.
A woman could offer you the first reasonable gig you've had in years.
I tell her how talented and beautifuI, et cetera, et cetera.
She goes all the way to Martineau's to find you.
She calls me later to tell me that she did like your style...
...or whatever's left of it, and you know what you do?
Why don't I remember any of this?
You're kidding me.
You know what you did?
You called her a dyke!
"A greasy, diesel dyke," to be exact.
- Why would I say that?
- Because she is one.
But you have to say it?
Listen, Jacky...
I just woke up with a dead guy.
You got more serious problems than lousy lovers, believe me.
No.
I mean, dead, Jacky.
This man is cold.
You're kidding me.
- I'm looking at him.
- He had a heart attack?
Yeah, from a knife in his chest.
And there's- There's blood all over.
Christ, Alex.
Should I call the-?
Should I call the cops?
- I think you better.
- I'm scared.
You know what I mean, Jacky.
The cops?
No, it's bad if you run.
I don't even know where I am.
You better call the cops. And a lawyer.
It'll be all right, babe.
You wanna bet?
Wait! Taxi!
Taxi!
1560 Sweetzer.
- What time is it?
- Ten-fifteen.
Friday?
Thursday. November 28th, 1986.
Do me a favor, will you?
Stop by my bank. It's on the way.
It won't do you any good.
- Turkey. Pilgrims. Indians and all that.
- Shit.
That bank inquiry isn't your sweet way to beat me out of my fare, is it?
Fairfax and Santa Monica.
- Hey, Harry.
- Viveca.
You were on again last night, channel 13.
With Richard Egan.
You sure were something, Viv.
Hey, I missed the bank.
Could you cash a check?
- Sure, Viv.
- Could you stand 200?
Thank you for calling AirCal.
Due to Thanksgiving traffic, all our reservations-
Hey, Red, thanks for opening up.
- Viveca phone?
- Nope. Just those.
You can take off now. I just got a couple of heads to do for parties.
Make sure I got a line upstairs, will you?
- Miss Harding say what it was about?
- Nope.
Probably the party.
They give one every Thanksgiving.
I know. I see pictures of it in the Friday papers.
- Lucky.
- Who?
You. It's Bel Air, you go out, you do her hair...
- ... and then you get to stay, right?
- For a while.
Thanks for coming in, Red.
Flight 795 DC-9-
Hi. When's your next flight to San Francisco?
On the half-hour, but it's booked.
- Well, I'll take the next one.
- That one's booked too.
- How about later this afternoon?
- We're booked all day. It's a real mess.
How about, what do you call it, stand-in?
Standby. You can try. Gate 2B, but they're like animals.
- What is it?
- Oh, God.
My husband just called.
I've been stuck in traffic for two hours.
To tell me that she's dying.
Her condition was stable when I left San
Francisco, and now, all of a sudden...
- ... with no warning-
- She? Whose condition?
My daughter.
Acute angina pectoris.
- Seventeen years old.
- Oh, my God.
- Please, can't you get me on a flight?
- Honey, let me get my supervisor.
- You wait over there.
- Oh, thank you.
Madam, I've been told of your situation.
And we'll do everything possible, of course...
...but there's no procedure whereby we can arbitrarily displace...
...passengers already holding tickets on our San Francisco flight 119 in order to-
How about Vegas?
- What?
- Do you fly to Vegas?
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, you guys.
- How in the hell can you do-?
- I called the Auto Club.
It just went dead on me.
I'm sorry.
Let me give it another try.
I think it's just the electrical system.
Let me try it again.
Oh, my God, what do you know.
It must've just needed a rest.
- Your taillights don't work, lady.
- Hey, are you insured?
I doubt it. Why don't you stay here while I go get the police.
Hey, don't I know you from someplace?
You look familiar to me.
God!
This may take a little while.
That's okay.
You wanna try the starter?
Where is it?
It's hanging below the dash.
Two little wires.
All right, now give it gas.
No, give it gas!
Okay, okay, okay.
Oh, God.
This isn't a pickup, is it?
Okay, I was just checking.
You going into L.A.?
I'm Turner Kendall.
Viveca-
- Do you watch much TV?
- No, not much.
I've got a loose heel.
Spade in a Caddy.
Ran into somebody.
"Spade in a caddy"?
Is that anything like jack-in-the-box?
I wish I had the Caddy dealership in Watts.
Spades...
...they spend disproportionately on their transportation.
Also in dressing their young.
What are you, the Klan anthropologist?
You can tell a lot about people from the cars that they drive.
You sure can.
This is an investment.
An investment?
Sure. I fix it up a little bit, your beaners...
...they'll fight with machetes for a car like this.
My "beaners"?
Yes, it's the tailfins.
Anything late '50s, GM or chrysler.
You don't say "beaners"?
No.
On your best behavior, huh?
Third and Garland.
- That's where I'm going.
- Oh, okay.
But I'll be glad to take you wherever you're going.
Just drop me where I can get a cab.
- Whatever makes you happy.
- A cab! A cab would make me happy.
Look, it wouldn't be out of my way to take you where you're going.
How do you know?
How do you know where I'm going?
No place would be that far out of my way.
Find yourself with a lot of free time on your hands, Turner?
Oh, just the Klan meeting this week.
That's all I got.
- You need water?
- No.
You're experienced, huh?
Some things.
- What were you doing at the airport?
- Me?
Seeing my daughter off.
Spent a couple of days with me.
I put her on a 12:30 flight...
...so she'd get to her mother by turkey time.
- Twelve-thirty?
- Yeah, I hung around, I guess.
I used to like to watch the takeoffs and landings. Now, modern airports...
...you can't see the planes, just like the bus depot.
- I haven't heard that in years.
- What?
"Bus depot. "
Well, it was a holiday.
Maybe you like watching all those people say goodbye.
Yeah, maybe.
They say hello too, you know.
This'll be fine right here.
Here? You sure?
Yeah, my friend lives right around the corner.
Whatever makes you happy.
What if he's not home?
He's home.
He's sick.
Thanks again for the lift.
Oh, it's stuck. You gotta pull back and shove at the same time.
- Give one to the Grand Dragon for me.
- Oh, you got me all wrong, lady.
- Really?
- Well, that's okay.
I probably got you wrong too.
Hello!
Listen...
...if I did that to you...
...I didn't mean it, I swear to God.
I'm not a bad person.
I'll just tidy up, and you...
...keep on doing whatever you were doing.
But if I did do it...
...you must've gotten me crazy.
You call me a lush?
Something crazy like that?
I'll get the windows next time.
Kitty?
Here, kitty.
How did you get into a closed-?
- How is he?
- Who?
Your sick friend.
He's better.
- You're a lady with a lot on her mind.
- What do you mean?
Don't you wonder how I found you?
It must've dropped out of your purse.
It had your friend's address on this matchbook.
- You do his laundry for him?
- All the time.
You don't look so domesticated to me.
Well, I'm not. I'm just a good friend.
- It must be nice having a good friend.
- You lonely, sailor?
No, but I don't have anybody doing my laundry.
Poor thing. Where you from?
- Bakersfield.
- No wonder.
And you're L.A. by way of the Big Apple.
Right.
- Thanks.
- Anytime.
I'll take it.
That's okay. I'll take it to the door for you.
What do you do for work, Turner?
I'm a cop.
Ex-cop, really. Disabled.
Don't look disabled to me.
I'll take that as a compliment.
Good night.
I'd ask you in, but it's too ethnic.
- The neighborhood.
- Oh, I know. It's Jewish.
- Very stable real estate. Low turnover.
- Exactly.
Helps them to keep certain traditional values.
Very heavy emphasis on educational achievement.
- In the arts, hey, these people-
- Please.
But, you know, that kind of isolation, that does breed prejudice.
Turner.
Look, I have a little disappearing act.
I count to three, and you disappear.
One, thanks for helping me today.
- You're welcome.
- Two...
...you really saved my life.
Anytime.
Three...
...goodbye.
Sure.
It didn't work.
Sometimes it doesn't.
You know, when I'm tired.
What the hell, come on in.
I got a couple of tacos in the freezer.
Whatever makes you happy.
That's what you've got, all right.
Two tacos.
Have I ever lied to you?
That's very weird.
- What's weird?
- Two tacos, a jar of olives...
...and six and a half jars of mayonnaise.
Well, I always think I'm running out.
And...
...possibly lettuce, or is that a lime?
I don't cook.
And four gallons of Thunderbird.
It was on special.
All your...
Your credit cards are all expired.
I noticed, in your wallet.
But there's millionaires wish they had as much mayonnaise as you've got.
Any plans for tonight?
Yeah, I'm gonna take a shower.
Air conditioner's been busted for a month.
Well, take your shower, and I'll be right back.
What for?
It looks like you could use some real food.
Give me your keys...
...to get back in.
Oh, God.
The only...
...turkey that they had was sandwiches.
That's fine.
And cranberries.
Well, you gotta-
You gotta have cranberries.
Oh, it's a trifle fruity...
...lacks depth...
...but for the bucks, you can't beat it.
Hey, you married, Turner?
Well, who'd marry a guy with a '56 chevy?
It's an investment.
How'd you get disabled?
Oh, it was an- An incident.
Really let it all hang out, don't you?
Okay, I got stabbed...
...by a little hooker, 14 years of age.
A little spic hooker, was she?
See. Now, I didn't say anything about "spic. "
What stopped you?
She happened to be of Scotch-Irish extraction...
...but you're right, most of them are Chicano.
- I didn't invite them in.
- You wouldn't.
Hey, come on. It's Thanksgiving.
Well, I'll drink to that.
Anyway, she must've...
Must've cut some nerves up here. can't draw my weapon right anymore.
Feels awkward.
Maybe you just got tired of being a cop.
You kidding?
That was the best job I ever had.
Oh, hassling drunks and hookers?
Speed traps?
- Must've been a great life.
- Yeah, I did investigation work.
I might have made detective.
- Was it in L.A.?
- In Bakersfield.
Seven years.
That's where you studied bigotry.
You're bad.
How can I be a bigot?
I mean...
...they're all...
...full of ill will and malice.
I just...
...make observations.
Like "spade," "beaner" and "spic"?
That sounds like a law firm, doesn't it?
"Spade, Beaner and Spic, good morning. "
You got a twisted view of the world, you know that, Turner? coming from who? A broad who's got
100 gallons of cheap wine...
- ... and two frozen tacos in her icebox?
- Don't forget the mayonnaise.
Actually...
...I'm rather surprised that I don't look familiar to you, Turner.
Obviously, you don't watch the better TV channels.
- What?
- I am an actress.
Was.
I was even good.
They were grooming me to be the new Vera Miles.
The new who?
Exactly.
Exactly.
I was supposed to replace somebody the audience didn't even know was missing.
- I gotta call Jacky.
- Call who?
Oh, God, Turner.
Don't you know anybody?
I mean, what do you do all day?
- I do plenty.
- Well, name one.
I like to repair stuff.
Stuff. What stuff?
Whatever needs it.
Whatever people are through with.
Were you really any good?
I could've...
I could've been a contender.
Hey, I think I did see you in a movie once.
Thanks.
Who's that?
Hold the fort.
- Hello?
- Alex?
Jacky.
I'm gonna take this in the bedroom.
Would you hang up the phone, Turner?
Hi, Jacky.
It's me again.
Who's drunk?
Oh, come on, baby, aren't we pals?
What? Oh, yeah, that.
Just slipped my mind.
Oh, don't get mad.
Nothing. I've just got some laundry to do.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I'll do it tomorrow.
Alex?
Oh, God.
Jesus.
Oh, shit.
Hello, gorgeous.
God.
- Come here.
- No. No!
What are you doing here? No.
Fix your air conditioner.
No. No!
I want a drink.
I want a drink.
And there was somebody in the apartment when I went back.
You saw somebody?
No, but they were watching...
...from in the closet.
- See, I was looking for the cat.
- Your cat?
Somebody's cat.
A goddamn blue-eyed cat.
Where is he now?
How do I know? On Broadway.
And I got out of there.
You say that you saw this dead guy on TV?
You sure?
I'm sure.
He was taking pictures of ladies with biceps and string bikinis...
...and there was a lot of loud music.
That's all you know about the guy?
He takes dirty pictures?
- That and you took him to bed.
- Oh, wait a minute.
He took me. It was- It was his place, not my place. It happens.
Might just be your way of making friends.
But you know what's funny?
I didn't like him.
No, I guess you didn't.
I mean, on TV.
- I wouldn't have gone to bed with him.
- You did.
I know.
- I know, but it's funny anyway.
- It's not funny.
You black out, don't you?
My advice, turn yourself in to the cops.
That's what Jacky says.
Who the hell is Jacky, huh?
My hairdresser.
- You told your hairdresser?
- He's also my husband.
You wouldn't understand.
Look...
...Turner, if the cops get their hands on me...
...they're not gonna look for anybody else.
- That's not true.
- Because...
Because of the other time.
What other time?
My ex-husband called the cops and had me booked and tanked.
Jacky did?
Jacky's not my ex-husband.
Before Jacky, there was another guy.
We were kids.
- Why'd he put you away?
- Because he was an asshole.
We were discussing my problem over a couple of drinks on a weekend...
...and next thing I know, he's bleeding.
And I have a paring knife in my hand.
How long were you inside?
A while.
Three months.
That's long enough to know what it is.
Yep.
You've been drinking for some time, huh?
We weren't drinking then.
- We were just, like-
- Kids, I know.
Do you really drink now?
No.
When I want.
Who the hell's side are you on, anyway?
Thanks.
- Whose place is this?
- A friend's.
This one alive?
- Maybe you did kill that guy.
- I didn't.
Well, either you did it and you blacked out...
...or you blacked out and you were set up.
I choose number two.
- Either way-
- So long, Turner.
- It's been nice talking to you.
- You're a lush with a record.
What do you expect to call somebody guzzles beer at 9:00 in the morning?
You bought it for me, you son of a bitch.
- It's stuck. You've got to pull back-
- I know, I know.
Grab it with both hands and shove.
Why don't you get your lousy car fixed.
- I don't have the money.
- Well, get a job, you bum.
In the movies, like you?
Shove it up your lily-white ass, Turner.
Grab it with both hands and shove.
- Come on, Frankie, rise and shine.
- Yeah?
- It's me, Alex.
- Oh, hi, girl. What's happening?
Frankie, you alone?
Yeah. Yeah.
You won a million dollars!
God, who are all these people?
What's everybody doing up?
- It's 2 in the afternoon, Frankie.
- What a night. You should've been here.
- Or were you?
- I need help.
Oh, honey, don't we all?
No, listen, I don't have time.
- I need clothes, makeup.
- And a dye-job.
Honey, you know where everything is.
You help yourself.
What do you think?
Oh, God. Frankie, don't you have anything simpler?
- You know, a little less...
- I'm a drag queen, not a transvestite.
I don't buy no housedresses.
There is- There is a thing I bought last year for a date at the bistro.
He was with the Mafia.
Real sweet. And they're conservative.
Wait.
- Oh, God.
- Your basic black.
Don't tell me it won't start.
- I wanna help you.
- Who, me? The drunk?
Yeah, that's what you are, all right.
- Then what do you wanna help me for?
- Because you're innocent.
There was no body in your shower last night.
And why would you put one in there after I left?
Somebody in the closet.
That could mean you were set up.
If you were set up, it might be somebody you know.
I gotta call Jacky. Maybe he can help.
He's smart.
- He knows the people in charge.
- In charge of what?
Everything. The world.
He's a hairdresser.
That's what he does.
It's not what he is.
How long you been separated?
- We were married 10 years.
- How long ago did you separate?
Ten years ago.
- Must be lovely growing old together.
- We gave it a try, and it didn't work.
But, you know, when we separated, we got close.
It's funny, but- I don't know,
I guess it's not so funny.
He loves me and...
And I helped him.
I- I put up a chunk of my savings for his first shop.
When I stopped getting parts in pictures...
Jacky takes care of me.
Whose idea is staying married?
Both of us.
I think I help him out with those
Beverly Hills clients he scores.
So he's straight, huh?
Yes, Turner, there are straight hairdressers.
In Bakersfield, Jacky's a gay name.
His name is Joaquin Manero.
You married...
...a Spanish man, huh?
Give you a little body on the top. Okay?
Jacky, these two gentlemen are here to see you.
Oh, and...
...viveca called. She said she'll call back.
She can't be reached.
Is this a good place to talk?
No.
Was she having something with this guy she killed?
Come on. Viveca never killed anybody.
Stiffs just use her apartment to take showers in?
- Who told you to look there?
- We're detectives.
She's not capable of it. I know her.
She got a violent record.
Assault with a deadly weapon.
Did you know that when you married her?
It's why I married her.
Are you just here passing the time, or should I call my lawyer?
It's a great place for a stud.
Or are you a fag, Jacky?
How bad do you wanna know?
He's not in his office.
I called his car, and he's not there.
Listen, viveca, there's this cop that
I know with Homicide, right here in L.A.
No.
- Maybe he can help.
- No cops.
Just on the phone.
Why should I trust some cop pal of yours?
I don't know. He's Jewish.
Come on.
Sergeant Greenbaum.
A friend of yours said I should call.
Yeah. Hello.
I'm calling about a body.
Any particular body?
The one-
The one on 1560 Sweetzer.
Mr. Korshack.
That body, yeah.
Hey, your friend doesn't want you to trace this call.
What about Korshack?
Hello?
- Are you Viveca Van Loren?
- I didn't do it.
- I'd like to hear your side. Maybe we-
- I just...
I thought you should know that where he wound up...
...isn't- It's not where he started.
- So to speak.
- So to speak?
If I tell you where it happened, maybe you can find out how it happened.
- Are you giving me a clue?
- An address. I'm giving you an address.
He was killed in a loft apartment at 544 Mateo Street.
And I think you should look for fingerprints inside the closet.
Near the entrance.
- Just go over there right now.
- Oh, by the way...
...who's the friend that recommended me to you?
This whole area.
All gonna go get turned into black-glass skyscrapers.
The smart ones...
...are making a bundle holding out, like this Korean landlord that I got.
He's been here less than 10 years, owns half of L.A.
They say Orientals have bigger brains than us. You think so?
Sounds reasonable.
Maybe I should go in first, turn some lights on.
I only came to L.A. a while ago with my wife.
A month after that...
...we got divorced.
She went back...
- ... and we split up the stuff.
- Everybody gets divorced.
Well, I don't believe in divorce.
You don't believe in it?
I hate it.
- Why'd you do it?
- She did.
She said I wasn't...
...promising.
Left you her cookery stuff, huh?
That was mine.
He cooks too?
You're quite a find, Turner.
She must've been crazy.
Oh, I don't know, I-
I see her point.
Don't you lie about anything?
Yeah, sure.
What's worth Iying about?
You're a great reader, huh?
Those?
Well, no, I mean...
...I plan on reading them when I-
When I have the time, you know.
I just...
...buy books.
Quarter apiece sometimes in Santa
Monica. Even by the pound sometimes.
I can't resist. All the...
All the subjects interest me.
I'll get to them.
What's keeping you so busy?
Oh, you know, nothing.
Daily life.
That'll do it, daily life.
Oh, my God. Nancy Drew.
- It's a complete set.
- Yeah, I'm saving those for my daughter.
Only she just- She just told me she's too old for them now.
Too old? Oh, I always loved her.
Oh, God, Nancy Drew.
She's so smart and,
I don't know, outgoing and...
Do you want them?
- What?
- You can have them if you like.
- Oh, no, I couldn't.
- Why not?
- No, really.
- Please.
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
All right.
Good.
I'd love them.
God, when I'm in the clear.
Yeah, when you're in the clear.
Been a long one, huh?
What do we do now, Turner?
Wait for Greenbaum to do his stuff.
Waiting for Greenbaum.
I think I saw the play.
You're a rare dame, viveca.
Listen...
...viveca's my fake name.
I'm really...
I'm Alex Sternbergen.
Weren't you...
...a sports announcer out of Cincinnati?
Alex for Alexandra.
That's nice.
I like it too.
Like in arguments, it's harder to yell Alexandra.
So...
...would you mind if I call you Alexandra?
If you promise not to yell it.
Oh, I won't yell it.
Do you have anything to drink?
Well, I got some vodka.
You want some?
No.
What's going on, Turner? Do you know?
Well, tomorrow I'm gonna go over to the loft and see what-
Here, I mean. Now.
Yeah, I know.
What is it? We wanna get laid?
Why do you do that?
What?
You haven't wanted to get laid in years.
I didn't say you haven't been.
I said, you hadn't wanted to in years.
Well, then...
Hey.
Stay until morning?
Sure, darling, I live here.
Don't you drink?
You'd think...
...they'd mention the one fucking good film I made.
You were asleep on the couch this morning-
- I heard you go.
- Why didn't you say hello?
I went over...
...to Martineau's, that place you said you were at. Korshack was never there.
Then where'd I meet him?
- You don't know, huh?
- No.
Yeah.
In bed.
Well, you made a call at Martineau's, and you got a call.
Well?
- You remember nothing?
- No.
None of it?
- Do you remember last night?
- Yes!
I was thinking somebody might've asked you to leave on the phone.
- Why'd they pick on me, Turner?
- Why not? You're perfect for it.
You got a record.
You're a blackout drunk.
You've pissed away half of your life.
But you made such a success out of yours?!
Restoring fucking toasters?
- You don't know what it's like!
- What?
Losing it!
What'd you ever have to lose?
- I was an actress.
- You drink, Alexandra!
- Oh, you're yelling.
- Fucking booze!
You're yelling.
Don't you wanna know what's going on?
I gotta get out of here.
- Go where?
- Where does Greenberg live?
- Greenbaum.
- Oh, they live together. Isn't that sweet?
Hey.
Will you do me a favor?
Have I ever denied you anything?
Stay here.
I'll be back.
Viveca.
- Have you seen the paper yet today?
- No. I picked up a copy at the airport...
...but haven't had a chance to read it.
Yeah, Jacky reached me in Tokyo.
About an 88-hour time difference...
...but you know Jacky when he wants to do something.
- He spoke to you?
- Well, I...
I assumed he'd already spoken to you.
Wait a minute.
- Spoken to me?
- Well, isn't that why you're here?
- Why?
- Well, we worked it out together...
...he and I, before I left for Tokyo last Monday.
Monday?
- Welcome back, Mr. Hurley.
- Thank you.
- Wait.
- Messages can wait, Miss Rose.
Yes, Mr. Hurley.
It's just a simple matter of formalizing what's been the de facto truth...
...between the two of you for some time now.
You do want me to handle it, don't you?
- What is there to handle?
- The divorce.
What else?
Nothing else.
That's the woman. The blond.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
Well, not to swear in court.
I heard her yelling and then...
...I just caught a quick look at her as she ran down the hall.
- And what was she yelling?
- She was threatening somebody.
What was she threatening to do?
It was more ranting and raving.
- She was drunk.
- I wouldn't say...
Well, she could've been.
Did you ever see her before? Did she visit that second-floor apartment often?
Not to my knowledge.
That's how I put it to the police.
All right, thank you.
- You're locking your cat out.
- I wouldn't own a cat.
Whose little cat are you, blue eyes?
Hey!
I'll look in on you in just a few minutes.
Where the hell have you been?
Change my looks, will you?
It's a mistake.
What about color?
Natural.
Give me a hint.
Some kind of brown.
What?
- What is it?
- Come on, Jacky.
I talked to Hurley.
He must've called you.
- You don't understand.
- Yes, I do.
That's what's sad.
Doesn't even have anything to do with the jam I'm in.
- He said you talked to him a week ago.
- He did?
You couldn't come to me?
We didn't even have a fight.
- You had to go to a fucking lawyer.
- He's your lawyer too.
Was my lawyer.
You have all the business now.
It's just legal shit. I'm going public.
You know what that is?
Selling stock. So?
It gets complicated.
It's not so complicated.
You met somebody, didn't you?
Anybody I know?
Isabel Harding.
You're kidding.
No.
- Harding? As in Pasadena?
- Bel Air.
I love her anyway.
She a client?
- Sometimes you do her in her home?
- Once in a while.
- Beautiful place, huh?
- Beautiful enough, yeah.
- All that money.
- I got money.
But with the Hardings, it's so much more. There's all that breeding.
Is that it? That early American stuff?
I don't give a damn about all that early American stuff.
But if you're talking about...
...clout...
...yeah.
Sure, Jacky.
You've been on the outside long enough, huh?
- Now you want in.
- I want in.
- Right. Joaquin Manero.
- You're damn right.
- You afraid of being bored to death?
- Not a bit.
She's probably no more boring than the rest of us.
Yes, she is.
Hey, Turner, you moving to L.A.?
Thinking about it.
How you been, sergeant?
- Bakersfield's a long commute.
- Oh, I'm not with them anymore.
- What brings you down here?
- Homicide. What else?
- The Korshack thing.
- Oh, it doesn't ring a bell.
- I'm surprised.
- Why is that?
Well, it made the news.
The deceased Bobby Korshack had a little something to do...
...with dirty pictures or art...
...depending upon how you feel about naked ladies.
The prime suspect is known to us, as they say.
- Well, you guys are good.
- Well, we got some problems.
Where he was killed, the body was moved, the place was cleaned up.
So there's no blood, no weapons, no signs of violence.
I'm talking about the kind of cleaning...
...my wife would go crazy to find somebody to do for us.
Just a strand of hair. Not Korshack's.
- What color?
- Blond.
A real blond?
Who knows these days.
Also, it could've came from a wig.
Well, the lab will tell you that.
You were wasted up there in Bakersfield, Turner.
She's still at large.
- Who's that?
- The prime suspect.
Actual movie star. Viveca Van Loren.
- She should be easy to find.
- She's been quick.
But I'm gonna give her
24 hours anyway.
Why is that?
On the outside chance she didn't do it.
Somebody out there knows she didn't.
Nice to see you again, Herb.
Same here.
Take care of your kitty, Turner.
Charlie, call Records.
Run a check on a cop.
Probably ex-cop, out of Bakersfield.
Retired, fired or disabled.
See if he's getting any checks forwarded.
I want a L.A. address for him.
Name's Kendall, first name Turner.
My God.
It's Alexandra Sternbergen.
It's not gonna hide you for long, babe.
No, I know. I'm okay. I got a place.
Where?
A guy. He's got an apartment.
- Sort of.
- Who, Frankie?
No. A guy I met by accident.
It's okay, Jacky. You don't need to know. Just stay out of it.
Alexandra?
You can't trust some guy you met in a bar, Alex.
- It was the airport.
- Wherever.
What does he want?
What do you mean? Nothing.
- What was he doing there?
- Seeing his daughter off.
Did you see his kid?
No, but she...
- He knows I'm innocent.
- So do I.
But not because he's my friend.
He saw there wasn't a body in the shower and then there was.
And then there was.
He put it there.
- No.
- Who else could have?
And so easy.
You were passed out, am I right?
It was when I was talking to you on the phone. He was there.
- Wasn't he?
- Yes.
And didn't he know where Korshack was?
- Will you call Hurley?
- First thing in the morning.
You'll be okay here for now.
- You know where everything is.
- Will you stay with me?
I have a dinner date.
With the Hardings?
I'll be back in an hour, an hour and a half. They go to bed like babies.
Hey, I'll bring Isabel.
Oh, that'll be nice.
Maybe she knows, you know, a tougher lawyer.
Tougher than Hurley.
You know the kind.
Gentleman-looking, but a real killer for his client.
- You want me to turn on the tub?
- Oh, no.
Take a rest, babe, okay?
Forget about everything.
Bring me back something from dinner.
I wake up hungry.
I remember.
Sam, pick him up when he reaches
Holden and Washington.
Thank you.
Thank you, all of you.
And thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Harding, for this lovely dinner.
And for having such a lovely daughter.
And now...
...I'm afraid I have to take her away from you for this evening.
- Oh, why?
- I'm not supposed to tell.
It's a surprise party.
I never did know how to get someone to one of those damn things...
...without giving it away.
Neither have I.
Thanks again for everything.
I know we'll see you again soon,
Mr. Manero.
I'm sure of it.
Fred, would you bring
Miss Harding's car around, please?
Jacky?
Jacky?
- Where's Jacky?
- He's coming back!
- Alexandra.
- Oh, God.
Alexandra, there was a double in that loft.
Somebody wanted to look like you.
They made a fuss, made some threats so the neighbors would see.
- They did. I talked to her.
- Who'd want to set me up?
Listen to me. Homicide has got a blond hair from up in the loft.
Now, what I'm saying...
...is that it came from your wig...
...and not from-
What the hell happened to the bleached blond?
Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.
- Where are your clothes?
We gotta get out of here.
We've gotta get this wig to Greenbaum.
No!
Alex, please.
Please! Please, Alex, please!
- I don't wanna hurt you more.
- Jacky.
- Oh, my God, what are we gonna do?
- I don't know.
Alex! Don't.
Jacky, we can't.
Isabel, you killed a man!
Now whatever has to be done!
You set me up to save her?
- Turn the water on!
- Jacky, no.
Do it!
Jacky.
- Who fired?
- That man there.
Call an ambulance.
Cedars? This is Officer Lewis.
We need an ambulance at 1625 Robertson.
Do what you can.
- Well?
- Very rapid, very weak.
- Barely there.
- Call for a second ambulance.
Lenny, you better get down here.
Just bring everything.
One guy, we don't think he's gonna make it.
The other one is hurt.
Just get down here. Right now.
Okay, thanks.
Stay down. You'll pass out.
Officer.
Thank God you're here.
He killed Korshack.
And now tonight, that poor man there.
No.
It was her.
Korshack had pictures.
He's been blackmailing her for years.
He threatened to show them to her father.
My father is Joshua Harding.
- You won't be able to-
- Harding? Is that Judge Harding?
Herb, phone.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Dr. Klein, will you call extension 7042?
Dr. Klein, call extension 7042.
He's gonna be all right.
What can I do for you?
Nothing, thanks.
It was impounded.
That '63 Mercedes you left at the airport day before yesterday.
The day before yesterday.
I got it released.
Had them leave it downstairs.
Thank you, Herbie.
L.A.'s hell without a car,
Miss Van Loren.
Dr. Howser, will you call Pathology, please?
Dr. Howser, please call Pathology.
- Miss?
- Dr. Howser phoned me to meet him.
Who the hell are you?
That sports announcer you liked.
You know, from Cincinnati.
Well, I never liked him.
How'd you get in here?
Dr. Howser said it was okay.
Doctor's name is Pitkin.
I use Howser.
I never trusted Manero, but I love the way he made you look.
He didn't do it.
I always used to look this way.
Oh, I should've known you then.
Yeah, you should've.
Yeah.
Where is he? Jacky.
- With your pal, Herbie.
- Oh, they got enough on him?
I don't know.
Miss Harding says he killed Korshack, and he says she did it.
Bye-bye, Jacky.
What do you mean?
Well, who do you think they're gonna believe, her or some-?
Some guy named Joaquin Manero?
Who do you believe?
I think she did it.
I think they'II...
...put him away, and I think...
...she'll do a little time. Or none.
I think that's the way it is.
It's a bitch.
Wanna hand me some water here?
What are you gonna do?
When?
You know.
I don't know yet. Work.
Wait for you to get sprung.
That's a nice thought...
...but all we know about each other is a day and a half on the run...
...and somebody trying to kill us.
Brings people together.
May be a good way to start.
Hell, the rest'll be like...
...I don't know, Sunday on the farm.
What do you know about a farm?
Well...
I have great hopes for you, Alexandra.
What about for us?
You don't wanna live with a...
With a lush, is that it?
Would you want to?
I haven't had a drink in two days and a night.
We say goodbye then?
Yeah.
Whatever makes you happy.
- You been here all night?
- Yeah. I'm just leaving.
Take good care.
Alexandra.
You have a right to know something.
- A right?
- Yeah.
I was...
...a drunk for 10 years.
I got cut, but I was...
...on my way out for a long while.
- You came back.
- Trying to.
It can be done.
I know this trick.
I count to three, you disappear.
One, thanks for visiting.
- You're welcome.
- Two...
...also, it was a pleasure meeting you, Alexandra.
Yes, it was.
Three...
...good luck.
You too, Turner.
It didn't work.
I never did see that damn trick done right.
And you never will.
Whatever makes you happy.
You. Oh, you make me happy.

All right. You can go on in.
You know the way?
- Yes, I do. Thank you.
- Okay.
Oh, I'm sorry I'm late.
I had car trouble again.
Would you believe it?
I'll think up something for you tonight.
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yeah. Bye-bye.
Hey, Bill, you left the lights on again.
The dishes are on the table.
The refrigerator door was open.
I hate this.
The whole place is a mess.
Hi, Mom.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Any calls?
No, your boyfriend did not call.
- You sure?
- If he called, I'd tell you.
Phone didn't ring.
How would you hear it if it did with the radio going like this?
I've got good ears.
What's that all about?
Hmm?
I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?
What's your school counselor want to see me for?
I don't know, Mom.
Your halo's burning.
Are you in trouble?
Look, Mom, believe me, this is meaningless, okay?
Just don't worry about it.
Throw it away.
You going to come in soon?
Yeah. I'm just gonna finish up.
I'll be in in a minute.
Mom!
- No, no, no! Oh, Billy!
- What? What?
Billy.
He's in the room!
Look around the room!
- Who? Who?
- Look around the room!
Come here. Come here.
Mommy!
Mommy, what happened?
They're locked.
I'll look in the bathroom.
- Mommy!
- What happened?
- Mommy!
- Mommy!
Look in the closet!
Mommy.
It's empty.
- Look around the house!
- Mommy. Mommy.
Mom.
Mom, there's nobody here.
Call the police.
Call the police.
Mom, there's no one in the house.
The front door's locked.
No one came through the garage.
You didn't see anybody?
You didn't hear anyone?
No. Only when you screamed.
Mom, you must have had a bad dream, that's all.
Come on, stop crying.
Kim. Kimmy, you've had bad dreams.
Now Mommy's had one.
That's all.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- You okay, Mom?
- Sure.
Bill! Ohh!
- There's something coming!
- What?
- We've got to get out of the house.
- What are you talking about?
We've got to get the kids!
Come on!
- Come on.
- Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.
No. No. No.
We've got to get out of the house.
- What's happening?
- It's in my room.
- What?
- Come on. Come on.
Get her in the car.
Here.
- Oh, my God. The keys.
- I'll get 'em.
No! Stay right here.
I'll be right back.
Come on. Stop crying.
Stop crying.
- Come on.
- Why are we leaving?
Don't worry about it. We're just going somewhere, all right?
But we don't want to leave.
I'm scared.
Shh. Shh.
Shit. Shit.
Shit.
Did you hear it?
Did you hear it?
Hear what?
I'll get some pillows and some blankets.
Billy, honey, can you help me?
Ohh.
Good.
There. Now, let's see.
We'll put Julie over there and Kim and Mom here.
And, oh, gosh, looks like it's the floor for you, Bill.
Honey, you coming to bed or not?
In a minute, George.
Here, here, here.
Here, we'll take care of this.
- What--
- You just--
Listen. Thank you.
Nonsense.
What are good friends for anyway, huh?
Don't you be bashful, because there's plenty of food in the refrigerator for the morning, and...
- Yeah.
- You know.
Get a good night's sleep.
- You too.
- All right. Night.
You all right?
Yeah, if you're all right.
I don't understand, Mom.
I don't understand what's going on.
I don't either.
Are you all right?
Just go to sleep, okay?
Just go to sleep.
I've gotta find Captain Raccoon.
I have a telegram for him.
Good morning!
Carla, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
- Hi. How you doing?
- How'd you sleep?
- Great.
- Good.
We helped ourselves to cereal, and I made coffee.
- Great. Love some.
- You want some? Okay.
- Did you make it strong?
- Of course I made it strong.
- What do you think?
- Good girl.
- You want some milk and sugar?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Hey, this is pretty nice, being served in my own home.
What about George and I?
We keep you awake last night with all our snoring and stuff?
- No.
- The kids?
Anybody fall off the couch?
No. They're used to it.
So... what happened to you guys last night, anyway?
Nothing.
- You want one or two?
- Two, please. Thank you.
Beautiful day outside, isn't it?
Nothing like good old Southern
California for lots of sunshine.
- I was raped.
- Yeah--
- What?
- I was raped.
Oh, Carla, baby.
I'm so sorry.
I had no idea.
Oh, my God.
I feel all rotten inside.
Ohh. How did it happen?
Um... well, I was alone in my room, and... something grabbed me and smothered me.
Did you call the police?
- No.
- Why?
- There was no reason to.
- What do you mean?
There was nobody there.
Well, did you check the doors, the windows?
Yeah, I checked everything.
Everything was locked.
There was nobody there.
Oh, Carla. Oh, wait a minute.
I-- honey, I don't really understand this.
You were attacked, or you weren't?
It happened.
And when he-- when it was over, he vanished like he'd never been there.
You see?
There's no answer, is there?
I mean, I have flipped out.
I've flipped out twice, Cindy.
Carla, are you taking drugs?
No. I'm not on drugs.
Well, then I think you need to see a doctor.
Carla, you're one of the most stable people I know, and you are definitely not insane, but when men who aren't actually there come into your room and have intercourse with you, then it is time for you to see a good psychiatrist.
- I can't afford it.
- Oh, yes, you can.
Betty Rivers, I happen to know she goes over to the walk-in clinic at the university, and payment is whatever you can afford.
- I hate the thought of it.
- Oh, I know you do.
- I'm not crazy.
- Of course you're not crazy.
I'm not crazy.
You're not crazy.
You may be crazy.
Cindy, where's that coffee?
He's crazy.
Sure.
Listen, just think about it, huh?
You be honest with yourself, and everything'll be okay.
- I'll think about it.
- Good girl.
I'd like a cup of coffee, honey.
Coming, George.
Looky here. Nice and hot, just like you love it.
Is she going to leave today?
Well, honey, I haven't had a chance to talk to her about that yet.
God damn it, Cindy.
You told me you were going to tell her this morning.
I am going to tell her, you see, but first of all, I have to tell you.
What's happened to her is just a terrible thing.
What happened?
She probably got her butt evicted
'cause she didn't pay the damn rent.
We're not going to lend her any money.
George, don't raise your voice to me like that.
I can raise my voice in my own home if I want to.
I just don't want to hurt her feelings.
She's been through enough already as it is, and she is my best friend.
I've known her all my life.
Don't you cry on me.
Don't you cry on me.
- If you'd stop yelling at me...
- I'm going to set her straight.
Are we going to stay here all night, Mom?
You guys stay here.
Wow.
Do you hear that?
You did hear that, didn't you?
- I heard it, Mommy.
- What was it?
- The keys!
- It came from under the house!
- Don't go!
- Mommy, what's happening?
Bill, we've got to get out of here!
- Mommy!
- Where are you going?
No, don't do it!
Don't go under the house!
There's something there!
- Billy!
- Don't!
- Mom, leave me alone.
- No!
Come back!
Bill, come back!
Here, here.
Calm down. Calm down.
Bill, we've got to get out of here!
Shh.
Will you answer me? Bill!
I've found it.
This is it. Look.
When I touch this pipe, it makes a noise.
See?
Then who touched it before?
Mom. I'll leave the door open, okay?
Great.
Girl, didn't your mama teach you any better manners than to leave somebody's house without even telling 'em goodbye?
Oh, I see the couch is already taken.
Well, good.
I'll take the bed, then.
- What story did you tell George?
- Oh, that old sourpuss?
He thinks I'm with my sister in Reseda.
Not that I give a particular damn what he thinks after the way he behaved this morning.
Oh, that's all right.
Shoot. I ought to leave him, you know.
If I had the courage, I would.
He's gotten to be like a bad habit.
You know something, Carla.
I've been thinking.
Maybe you ought to just move out of this old house.
How can I?
I can't afford it.
I haven't even paid this month's rent.
I have a lease.
How can I?
When you've finished that typing school thing, you ought to be able to get a real good-paying job then, huh?
I hope so.
I'm counting on it.
You know, Carly, when he gets back into town, you and Jerry really ought to get married.
George says he's making a bundle now.
He loves you so much, and he absolutely dotes on the kids.
Hell's bells, girl.
Marry him, and you'll be living on easy street.
Now, what's all this baloney about you sleeping on the couch?
Which side of the bed do you want?
What side do you think?
The good side.
Well, doesn't make any difference to me.
I am so tired tonight,
I could sleep on a rock.
- Good night, sugar.
- Good night.
Julie likes the chips, and Kim likes the Fritos, okay?
Mm-hmm.
Don't you worry about a thing.
I'm going to get them dressed and fed and off to school on time.
You're great.
Here. I'll trade you.
- Okay.
- Okay. Thanks.
You're welcome.
You look so pretty.
- I'll call you later.
- All right.
Don't let Bill be late for school, okay?
Won't do it.
- Bye.
- Bye.
That's right.
At Mr. Tibby's Car Radio/Stereo, do we have boosters?
Do we have limiters?
Ask yourself, "How much should I give to the Lord?"
What's going on? Stop!
No!
Stop!
Stop! No!
Stop!
Stop!
No!
Stop!
Stop! Stop!
Stop!
Stop it!
Stop!
Hi.
I'm Dr. Sneiderman.
I'm one of the staff psychiatrists here at the clinic.
Are you cold?
Sometimes there's a draft, comes from the outer lobby.
Tell me, is this the first time something like this has ever happened?
No.
No, the first time was different.
I was raped.
Where? In your home?
You were raped by whom?
I don't know.
There was no one there.
Okay. So in other words, it wasn't a real man that raped you?
He evaporated.
I see. But you felt him in you, though?
Definitely.
And he felt like a man?
A big man.
- Were you in pain?
- Yes, of course I was in pain.
He was foul.
You mean you smelled him?
I see. Did he ejaculate?
I...
I think so.
But when my son came in, there was nobody there.
Right. And what did he think?
Your son.
He thought I was dreaming.
Mmmmm.
And what do you think happened?
Okay. That's okay, Carla.
Is this the only other time something like that happened?
No.
It started to a second time, and... he didn't get me.
We went to my friend's apartment.
And then this morning,
I was driving to work...
And he tried to kill you?
What do you think?
Go ahead, and be honest.
Just tell me.
You think I'm insane?
Insane?
That means different things to different people, Carla.
- So there's nothing you can do?
- Well, not at the moment, Carla.
First, we have to find out what the problem is.
In the meantime, I'll be dead.
No, I don't think so.
Look, Carla, you've done a very good thing by coming here.
You've already made a commitment to get better.
Really, that's the first step, and it's the hardest one.
Huh?
Look, I'd like you to take a few medical and psychological tests now.
They're very routine. Nothing hurts.
There's no surprises.
It takes about two hours.
Mostly it's just boring.
I'd appreciate it if you did not fall asleep while taking these tests.
Right now?
Yeah, I'd like to, if you can spare the time, okay?
Come on. I'll take you down to the lab, okay?
What are you doing up?
I couldn't sleep.
I was worried about you.
Where is everybody?
Billy's out working in the garage, and Kim's already asleep.
Did the doctor hurt you?
No, baby. We just talked.
Mommy, what happened to your hand?
No, don't worry about it.
You just get to sleep.
- Mommy?
- What?
Is everything going to be all right?
Of course it is.
I love you so much.
I love you too.
You go to sleep now.
- Hi.
- How do you feel?
Oh, I'm all right.
I'm just stiff.
What about the car?
Can you fix it?
Yeah, I can fix it, but it won't be cheap.
Listen. If Jerry calls, don't tell him anything, okay?
Good night.
Good night.
Oh, my God.
Please, God.
Carla, this is Mrs. Hilliard.
You want to hop up there now, show us what you're talking about?
Right here.
There's one.
And right there.
And in back.
Do you see that?
Mm-hmm.
And right here.
You said something about your thighs?
Yeah.
There... and there.
How about those bruises on your ankles? How did they happen?
Oh, thank you very much,
Mrs. Hilliard. That will be all.
Okay, look, Carla, why don't you come down, make yourself comfortable, okay?
Okay.
Can you tell me about those bruises on your ankles now?
I'm not sure.
It felt like my legs were being held, almost as if he had help.
Uh-huh. Are you saying that he wasn't alone?
It felt like there was someone on each leg.
I see.
So what are you saying?
That there were two more like him?
I guess so, but they seemed smaller.
Mmmmm.
You mean like children?
Oh, no, no, no. These aren't children.
They're strong.
Dwarfs?
I don't know what they were.
I couldn't see them. I felt them.
They're real, aren't they?
- I mean, these...
- Mm-hmm.
- Bites and bruises are real.
- Mm-hmm.
- They're real.
- Yes, yes.
The bites are real.
The bruises are real.
All pain is real.
Your feelings? They're real.
Oh, no, no. These are in places
I couldn't have bitten myself.
Carla, I've seen cases of hysteria that have raised welts, caused blindness, loss of hearing.
Well, haven't your tests told you anything?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
We know that there is nothing wrong with you medically, physiologically, that is.
And as far as we can tell, your intellect seems to function as well, if not better than normal.
So that leaves only one area for us to explore-- early psychological development, emotional development.
What does that mean?
Well, the general idea is that certain phases of our life never really die.
They continue to exist within us, all of us.
Now I'm talking about you, me, everybody, and they affect us the rest of our lives.
For certain reasons, they come back.
By coming back--
And sometimes they come back with a vengeance-- they can cause delusions, anxieties, hallucinations.
So simple.
Look, Carla, what I'm going to do is I'm going to give you some tranquilizers, okay?
They won't knock you out, but they will reduce your anxiety, which can be as bad as the delusion itself.
I want you to take two before you go to sleep.
Now, when you go home tonight,
I want you to take a long, hot bath, relax, get your kids in bed early, and I want somebody to be with you at all times, okay?
I don't want you to be alone.
I want you to get some sleep tonight.
That clear?
It's going to take a long time, isn't it?
It could.
Why don't we just take it one step at a time, though, okay?
Paging Mrs. Newman.
Call extension 376.
Carla?
What are you still-- wait a second.
I'll be right there. Wait. Wait.
- Gonna go late?
- Yeah.
- You gonna be on tomorrow?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Then I'll see you in P.M.
- Good.
- Carla, what's wrong?
- No.
- What are you still doing here?
Oh, I called a cab twice.
It never came.
- Yeah? What else is new?
- I'd better call again.
Look, why don't I give you a ride?
I'm parked right down here.
- No, really. It's all right.
- No, come on. Don't be ridiculous.
I'm right here.
It's no problem.
Come on.
Thanks for the ride.
Sure. Hope my driving didn't frighten you.
That's how I find out if my patients trust me.
There's something there.
There's really something there.
Carla, I'd be interested in taking a look inside. Would you mind?
- All right.
- You sure it's okay?
- Hi, Bill.
- Hi.
The kids get to the Greenspans' all right?
Yeah, yeah. They all went to get some pizza.
- They should be back soon.
- Good. This is Dr. Sneiderman.
- This is Bill.
- How do you do?
- How do you do? '64?
- Yeah.
What do you have in there?
215 or 235?
- A 235.
- All right.
This the girls' room?
Cute.
Would you like to show me where those attacks took place?
All right.
- May I?
- Yeah.
Okay. You said something about the bedroom, didn't you?
- Through there.
- That way?
Carla, your house isn't haunted, no more than your car is.
Why do I see and feel these things?
- I started to explain to you why--
- Yeah, I know what you told me, that terrible things happened to me in my youth might come back to haunt me.
Yeah, essentially.
Well, terrible things did happen to me, and I didn't have a normal childhood, but...
- Mm-hmm.
- How many people do?
- Carla. Carla.
- I mean, did you?
- How many people have normal--
- Carla.
Some things are more terrible than other things.
Some children are more sensitive than other children.
Make yourself comfortable.
So, you really think talk could fix all this, huh?
I don't know, but it's a good start.
All right.
I'll talk a blue streak if it'll stop all this from happening.
As a kid, I experienced every cliché in the book.
I was afraid of the dark.
I was scared of my father.
He was a minister, if you can believe it.
He actually spoke with "thee" and "thou."
I was six before I realized not everyone talked that way.
It was quite a shock.
Why were you afraid of him?
Because when he held me, it wasn't the way a father should hold a daughter.
How did he hold you?
You know what I mean.
Mmmmm.
Did your mother know?
I think so.
So I ran away, and...
I got as far as New York, and that's where I met Mario.
Billy's the spitting image of him.
It's very strange.
Really?
Must have been quite handsome.
- Billy's a good-looking kid.
- He was.
Can you tell me about him?
I was 16.
That says an awful lot right there.
I was--
I'd never met anyone like him.
He was exciting.
What do you mean, "exciting"?
Exciting in bed?
Yeah. He was exciting in bed.
He was exciting in many ways.
But you did like making love with him?
Mm-hmm.
At first, and then it turned bad.
The sex?
- Everything turned bad.
- I see.
I mean, I got pregnant.
Before I knew it, he started drinking, taking pills.
It was a mess.
Everything was a mess.
What happened to him?
He got himself killed on his motorcycle.
- I see. How old were you?
Gee.
So Billy wasn't born yet?
No. I mean, I was pregnant.
How did you feel when he died?
How do you think I felt?
I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?
- He was my husband.
- Yeah, I know that, but I still don't know how you felt.
I thanked God. I did.
I thanked God when he died.
I also thanked God for Bob Garrett.
- Bob Garrett?
- Julie and Kim's father.
Ah, right, right, right.
He was older.
He knew a lot.
He made me see that life was good, that men and women loving each other was good, healthy, having children was good, simple.
So Bob was your second husband?
Well, no.
We were never legally married.
Uh-huh. Where is he now?
I don't know.
He was never the kind to stay in one place very long.
I'm impressed.
By what?
By what? Your independence, knowing who you are, what you want, keeping your family together, doing it the hard way.
I do need your help.
I really do.
And I won't fight you.
Because if it is me, if it's really me creating all this, if I'm that sick... then I have to be stopped.
But if it isn't me... then we have to make a deal, you and I, to accept that fact and find about a way to stop it, okay?
Okay.
- Mommy!
- Mommy!
- In here!
- Mommy!
Hi. Hi, you guys,
How you doing?
- Fine.
- This is Dr. Sneiderman.
- This is Kim. This is Julie.
- Hi, Kim. Hi, Julie.
- You guys full?
- Yeah.
Aw, you don't have any room for dessert.
- Yeah, I do.
- I'm hungry for dessert.
Okay, okay.
I think it's time for me to go.
- Okay. I'll walk you out.
- Bye-bye, girls. Nice meeting you.
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.
I'm nervous about tomorrow.
- What, about the staff meeting?
- Yeah.
Oh, don't be silly.
They're perfectly routine.
- Good night.
- Bye-bye.
But there's still something here.
Mommy, I can't wait.
- Okay. Don't cheat.
- This is almost perfect.
- We're so hungry.
- This is the best part.
- Right, Mom?
- Okay, okay.
- Mommy!
- We got it. Okay.
Now hold on. Don't look yet.
Okay. Now look.
Mommy!
Okay, I'm going to go get a chair.
Hey. You can't use your hands.
Come on. Come on.
- Come on.
- Don't start without me.
Bill.
- Bill.
- Mom!
Help!
- Mom.
- No!
Help me! Help!
Get off her!
Get off her!
Get off her!
Stop!
Help me.
Help me.
Mom! Mom!
Mom!
Aah!
Mom!
Well, Dr. Sneiderman explained it was like a very powerful dream.
Mrs. Moran... did you believe him?
I tried to.
But you... cannot. Hmm?
Why?
Because he hurt my son.
He broke his wrist.
Because my children feel it.
Because of the marks on my body.
They're in places I--
I can't do it to myself.
Even in a dream.
Why does he attack you, Carla, not anyone else?
I don't know.
I suppose he chose me.
Chose you? Why?
I suppose he finds me attractive.
Would it be a reflection on you as a woman if he left you, or if you were cured?
No. It would not be a reflection on me.
I hate this whole thing.
It's like a nightmare,
I can't wake up.
I want to get rid of him.
Of course you do, Carla.
And we're trying to help you.
Well, I'm not sure how much good all this talking's doing.
Well, it's our way of trying to understand.
Well, so far, it hasn't helped.
It hasn't with Dr. Sneiderman.
Look, you'll have to excuse me.
I have an appointment.
I have to meet someone at the airport. Is that all right?
Certainly, and thank you very much,
Carla, for letting us talk to you.
- Sure.
- All right.
Quite a young lady.
- Yep.
- How did you meet her?
I was on call one night at the clinic, she walked in.
Just came in out of the blue?
- Please.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
- A walk-in.
That's how it happens.
- Yeah.
- She's masturbating.
This entire circus, she has invented it to cover up what every little girl does.
Well, with all due respect, sir, that was my initial diagnosis, but I think we can all agree that that's not some teenager with an identity crisis, and now she tells us that her children are feeling this thing too, so...
It's a mass illusion, folie a quatre.
Hysteria is contagious.
Given the right circumstances, anyone can see and feel things that simply aren't there.
Her children are just supporting Mama's delusions.
Okay, classically correct, sir, but her mind is giving her very strong and explicit images.
Why is she going to such lengths to support this delusion? It--
Phil, look at the record.
She believes that her father has incestuous desires.
She falls in love with an adolescent, a typical overgrown kid.
He tries to prove he's a real man, and he's not.
After which, she picks up with this...
- Jerry Anderson?
- No, Garrett.
- Oh, Garrett.
- Bob Garrett, right?
A man old enough to be her father.
See a pattern here?
I think I know what you're suggesting.
I don't know that I agree, though.
- Safe sex.
Well--
It's the story of Carla's life.
She's consistently refused to get involved in the real thing.
- She has three children.
- What does that prove?
It doesn't take sex to make babies.
That is a fact
I wasn't aware of.
- Well, now you know.
- Not real sex.
Now, for 32 years,
Carla goes along very smoothly, and all of a sudden, she meets this fellow--
- What's his name?
- Jerry Anderson?
- Now you have it.
- Ah, now I'm on it.
Okay. And, pow, she drifts into a Dionysian fantasy.
Don't you see?
It's exactly the kind of situation that can energize this sort of breakdown.
What, Anderson?
Certainly. A real man. Sure.
She wants the real thing.
No more faking it with kids and old men.
And faced with the real thing,
Carla buckles.
She falls back into an infantile reality.
Now, I suggest you dig a lot deeper.
I think you're going to find out more, and maybe you'll find out that Carla is not what she seems to be.
Hear, hear.
You look different.
- How?
- I don't know.
The face, this serious look.
- 80's yours.
- No, no.
Your eyes have... changed or something.
What is it?
It's been a long time.
You know, it's been too long.
- Something's wrong?
- No.
- Billy?
- No.
Me, right?
Come on.
No. Just nothing.
It's...
I'm only afraid.
You know, I'm just-- when you're not around,
I'm afraid of losing you.
That's all.
You won't lose me, honey.
I go crazy thinking about it.
Don't go crazy either.
What if I did?
What if I went crazy?
Now, you're not going to go and do that right now.
What would you do if I did?
Would you leave me?
You'd still be my Carla.
Why are you carrying on tonight?
Are you ready for my surprise?
Yeah.
I'm going on the road again, Carly, but this is the last time.
When I get back, it's for good.
I'm taking over the LA office.
We're going to be a family, Carly, all of us.
Take me with you.
Please?
Just put me in your pocket and take me with you.
Honey, I can't.
You know that.
Don't ask that.
What the hell are you asking, to take you with me?
Where? On the road?
Yeah. I'll go anywhere with you.
Okay, what about your job, your school?
How about the kids?
Who's going to take care of them?
Yeah, all right. Okay.
You're right.
It was just a pipe dream.
You have to go on the road, and I have to go through what...
I'm going through.
What you're going through?
You know, you're not telling me everything.
What the hell are you going through?
What I'm going through's being without you.
That's really what I'm going through.
Car, it's all going to change.
Oh, sure. When you get back.
Just one more trip.
Do you know it's been the way it's been ever since we met?
"Just one more trip."
No, I'm sorry.
I don't feel like it.
I'm sorry.
Look, I have to--
I think I should go home.
It's late, and I have to get up early. Okay?
I'll take you home.
No. You call me a cab.
You don't have to bother.
Ohh.
Ohh.
Oh, God.
Get out! Get out!
Get out!
Why did you tear up your room?
Why did you yell at Billy?
- Because I had an orgasm.
- What?
I had an orgasm.
An orgasm?
Yeah. But he tricked me.
I was asleep.
I was asleep, and I was dreaming.
And I'm ashamed.
I'm ashamed.
Mm-hmm.
Carla, I want you to sign yourself into the hospital.
No. I won't let myself be committed.
No, you're not being committed.
It's just going to be for a two-week observation period.
That's all.
It amounts to the same thing.
You know it.
Carla, do you know that if we wanted to, we can insist that you stay here.
- No, you can't.
- Oh, yes, we can.
Yes, we can, for trying to commit suicide.
- What are you talking about, suicide?
- You know what I'm talking about.
What do you think you were doing when you crashed your car?
- He was trying to murder me!
- It was a suicide attempt, Carla.
We could have you in here before the day is out.
No, you can't.
There were no witnesses.
I won't say a thing.
It's my decision.
- What, to stay sick?
- To stay alive.
No matter what you think, he's stronger than you are.
He'll kill me if he has to.
Why, to keep you from getting better, right?
However you want to call it, yes.
Yes, that's what I want to call it. Exactly.
How about Jerry?
What are you going to do with him?
How are you going to deal with him?
How would I deal with him from a padded cell?
What about your kids, Carla?
Carla, listen to me.
You're running the risk of harming your children.
No. They won't be harmed.
Billy has already broken his wrist.
Beyond that, you're harming them psychologically.
There's nothing wrong with my children.
Carla, that's not the environment they need. You know that.
Look, I know you think I'm crazy. it doesn't matter about your theories.
Whether it's me or something else is beside the point now.
What are you telling me? You're going to stay home and be victimized?
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes?
I'll stay at home. I'll see you.
I'll go to secretarial school.
When I graduate,
I'll look for a better job.
But the one thing I won't do is to go into any hospital.
Mm-hmm, and you'll be beaten and frightened.
- No. No.
- No? No? Why not?
'Cause I'm going to cooperate with him.
Carla, you're a very intelligent woman.
I know you'll always listen to reason, so now I want to talk to you reasonably, okay?
No more questions and answers, hmm?
You know, there was a time when people believed in the supernatural.
Here. I want you to look at these pictures.
Pretty frightening, huh?
Bats, werewolves, dragons, demons, all sorts of goblins, okay?
They were supposed to abuse people sexually.
They were supposed to impregnate people.
Do you think these things really exist in there?
- I am not stupid.
- I didn't say you were stupid.
But why do you think these people saw these things, huh?
Why do you think they saw them?
Hmm? Can you take a guess?
Do you know why?
Because it was a way of expressing something that was frightening to them.
- It has nothing to do with me.
- Wait a second. Carla...
- it has a lot to do with you.
- It has nothing to do with me.
Oh, no, it has a lot to do with you.
It has an awful lot to do with you.
These ghosts and demons were only ideas, but people saw them.
Look, Carla, let's say a man who wanted to be good had a desire for his neighbor's wife.
He knows it's wrong, he feels terrible about it, but the desire is growing and growing.
Desire can be a very frightening and powerful sensation.
How does he deal with it?
He invents a creature, an evil, ugly, evil-tempered creature which is just a picture of his own desire, Carla.
I have no need of inventing anything, Dr. Sneiderman.
Come on, Carla, stop it.
You have a lot of need.
You were scared of your daddy.
He was a minister.
He held you in a way
- he shouldn't have held you.
- Stop it.
- You were pregnant at 16.
- Oh, shut up!
A drug-crazed guy went off and killed himself.
- Stop it!
- Another guy left you with two kids.
Now, Carla, stop it!
Come on. Do the work, Carla.
What was evil to your family?
All sorts of things were evil to my family. You know that.
Carla, we know your family well enough to know what was evil to them.
As a child, you knew what was evil to him. What?
- Sex. They were afraid of sex.
- Sex. Sex. Sex. Sex. Sex.
They were afraid of sex.
Exactly.
So let's use our imagination a little bit, okay?
Let's try putting some things together.
Like a dream, it's getting all mixed up.
Your creature is a symbol, Carla.
A symbol of what?
I don't know yet.
Maybe we'll find out.
Could be a specific person, a fear of someone, a desire...
No, I'm not hiding from anybody or anything!
Carla. Carla, let's talk about your visitor friend, okay?
- Dr. Sneiderman, I'm so sick of this.
- Take a good look at him.
What do we know about him, Carla?
Come on. Let's use your words.
What do we know about him?
We know that he is big, we know that he is strong.
It's frightening how strong this guy is, isn't it?
You told me, unbelievably strong.
So why does he need help?
But he has two helpers, right?
Two little ones? Right?
Those are your words.
One big one and two little ones.
- Oh, you're obscene.
- Billy's a good-looking kid.
What you're suggesting is obscene.
- He's a strong kid.
- You're obscene!
You're having trouble with Jerry, and--
- You're obscene.
- Carla, calm-- Carla!
- I'll calm down, but not here!
- Carla!
Shit.
He was talking about two little ones and a big one.
He was implying that I wanted to make love with Billy.
It was just obscene, you know?
- Really.
- It was obscene.
There's no other word for it.
No. I think he just pushed too far.
He pushed too far. It was disgusting.
It was sickening.
I mean, I know he has to probe into painful areas
- and everything, but...
- That's not probing.
I'm not going back.
I'm never going back.
Oh, no. Wait a minute.
Maybe you're overreacting
- a little bit, Carla.
- I'm never going back.
- Honey?
- What?
- You ready to go?
- Yes, I am, George.
Just give me a minute, please.
Well, I'm going to get the car,
'cause I don't want to be late.
Okay, honey.
No, we're not going to be late.
I don't want to cause any trouble...
- No.
- between you and George.
I shouldn't have barged in.
I should have called.
No, no, no. We just have
- to make an appearance...
- I just wanted to talk.
At this boring wedding reception.
It's important to George, you know?
Well, I'm going to see you tomorrow.
No, I want you to stay here.
We're going to be back in less than an hour.
Now come on, Carla.
I need to talk to you some more about this.
Carla... will you wait here until I get back?
- Yeah.
- Please. You look so tired.
Why don't you sit down and have something to eat?
Have fun.
Okay. I'll see you in a little bit.
Okay.
Hi, Bill.
How are the girls?
How's everything? Okay?
Dr. Sneiderman?
You didn't tell him where I was?
I don't want to talk to him.
Good.
Look, you have the number here.
If there's any problem, call me, okay?
I'll be home in a couple of hours.
All right.
- What was that?
- What the hell? Was that our place?
Carly? Ohh.
Oh, my God. Carly.
Christ, she tore the fucking place apart.
No, she didn't.
You saw it.
She couldn't have done all this.
We both saw it with our own eyes.
We stood right there and saw it, George.
You saw it?
Yes. Yes, we did.
We saw it.
You saw it?
Please forgive me, Carly.
Please?
I never should have sent you to that clinic.
- You saw it?
- I'm so sorry.
Please forgive me.
You saw it.
You saw it.
Ohh! You saw it!
Yeah, I need "The Empty Fortress" and "Love is Not Enough."
Carla? Look.
"Improbability of the impossible."
"Psychic Self-Defense."
- Is this a $12.95 book?
- This is great.
You look at that.
I'm going to go over and check out the psychology section.
All right.
Let's just look at Rogers McGibbon, okay?
No. It's just not that good a case.
There's just not enough independent verification of the phenomena.
Yeah, but so much of it fits the classic patterns.
There's cold spots.
There's the smell.
There's objects moving around randomly, and, in this case, there is the appearance of an apparition.
Yeah, but that's just it.
The appearance of an apparition and the sudden movement of objects just don't occur simultaneously.
Excuse me.
Excuse me. They do.
I have them all.
You do?
Everything broke loose and went crazy, and everything was shaking.
The bed was shaking, and the walls were shaking.
Like an earthquake?
No, it wasn't like an earthquake.
It was much stronger than any earthquake.
And I tried to get out of here, and I wanted to get the kids out, and I called Bill.
Bill was in his room.
And then the door slammed.
It was just a horrible thing.
- Where is Billy now?
- He's out in the garage.
- You can talk to him if--
- Door slam like that?
Stronger. Much stronger.
Hmm.
And the bathroom.
This is where-- well, you know about that attack. And I-- this was the door. It was stuck, and I couldn't get out of it, and I tried, and I just couldn't get out of it.
It was stuck that night.
Yeah.
This is the girls' room.
They're asleep right now, and I don't want to disturb them.
Did they sleep through this whole attack?
Yeah, they managed to sleep through it.
- Sound sleepers.
- They are.
It's one of the good things about kids.
The living room.
This is where Billy got the lightning.
It was like it was lightning going into him, and he fell down.
He broke his wrist--
By lightning, you mean an electrical discharge?
I don't know what it was.
It was like lightning was going into him
- and I was on the couch.
- Like an arc?
Was it kind of like...
You don't believe me, do you?
Mrs. Moran, please understand.
We want to believe you.
We want to believe you very much, but it's--
It's just we want to do it right, Mrs. Moran.
- You want some coffee?
- Yeah, sure.
Yeah. That'd be real nice.
Oh, my God. Do you smell that?
Jesus.
It's awful.
You see?
I wasn't lying.
Mrs. Moran,
I think it might be worthwhile after all for us to set up some of the equipment we've got with us in the car.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Joe!
Gene, let's get her out of here!
Mrs. Moran, are you all right?
Mrs. Moran?
Gene, let's get out of here.
No, don't be frightened.
He's weak.
He's weak!
He can't touch us!
Gene, shoot it!
Ha! I don't believe it.
He can't touch us.
Die, you bastard! Die!
Die!
You can't touch us!
Die!
Die.
He can't hurt me anymore.
Not with you here.
He can't hurt me.
Oh, thank you, God.
Oh, thank you, God.
- Did you see it?
- I think so, yes.
- Did you get it?
- Yes.
Oh, thank you!
I'm going to go get the kids.
Gene, we're going to need an ion detector.
Hey, wake up.
Wake up, everybody.
It's a gorgeous day.
Gorgeous day.
Come here. Come here.
Wake up.
Isn't it a beautiful day?
Isn't it a beautiful day?
Come here.
Did you check the wiring?
It could be a short circuit, current leakage.
She spoke to it as if it were real, like it were alive and she knew it.
Isn't it possible she was hallucinating?
How do you photograph a hallucination?
This looks like some kind of electrical discharge.
What about this forking, right here?
Couldn't this be a head?
Couldn't this be a shoulder?
We feel that this photograph constitutes proof, Dr. Cooley.
I don't know.
Takes a long time before you can come up with something reliable.
You have to check every possible alternative.
What about the smell?
And the shaking?
That's classic poltergeist activity.
It also could be a dead cat and a tremor.
I don't know what you think you've discovered, but you're playing with fire.
I suggest you start with the traditional world and move outward.
We'll need more equipment to do that.
Maybe I'll authorize it when the time comes.
You say she was seeing a psychiatrist?
That's right.
I'd like to know what the diagnosis was.
Well, that's no problem.
She was seeing someone right here.
I got it.
Get that blue one.
Yeah, well, we're doing the best that we can.
Oh, we got a lot of people here, lot of folks, yeah.
Well, we're wiring the place up for any kind of movement that we might get and putting x-ray plates up also.
No, we're hanging up wires and stuff.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Carla Moran.
Are you here to observe the phenomena?
Observe the phenomena?
No, I'm Phil Sneiderman.
I'm a resident in psychiatry.
Carla's my patient.
Oh, hi. I'm Gene Kraft,
Department of Psychology.
How do you do?
Nice to meet-- what branch of psych you in?
Clinical? Dr. Morris?
No. Parapsychology.
Dr. Cooley.
- Gene.
- Oh, Parapsychology.
Gene, hand me a roll of tape, would you, please?
Yeah.
What are you guys doing with all this stuff?
We're trying to gather some hard data on the phenomena that's occurring here.
Oh, really?
I take it you've already looked under the beds and in the closets.
Yeah. We're leaving no stone unturned,
- but thanks for the tip.
- Sure.
As a matter of fact, we got some highly interesting
- electrical formations...
- Did you?
Possibly caused by the entity itself.
The entity?
The entity?
You know, I hope you guys will excuse me for saying so, but if you guys want to go on TV talk shows, bend spoons, entertain people,
I'm all for that, but this lady is under my care, and what you're doing isn't helping her.
Well, thank you very much for your professional opinion, Dr...
Sneiderman.
- Sneiderman.
- Uh-huh.
- Where's Carla?
- She's in the back.
...think it is.
I don't think so,
'cause you haven't been here during it.
Just to line it up, huh?
- Yeah.
- Carla?
Go over the doorway.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Boy, you got a lot of company.
You missed your appointment yesterday.
I was worried about you.
That's very sweet of you.
You look terrific.
I've never felt better,
Dr. Sneiderman.
- Really?
- Mmmmm.
Look, is there someplace that we could go and talk?
Yeah.
I can't blame you for not coming back.
I really did push a little too hard.
I think you need to understand something.
I feel very fine now.
There are no more attacks.
I have no reason to see you.
Carla, do you remember that book I showed you in the office?
The bats and the dragons?
That's what those guys are looking for, fantasies.
No, they have photographs.
Okay.
Look, Carla, how about you and me, we make a bargain, okay?
You can see me and still... have your scientist friends help you.
I don't see any point in that.
Well, it's like seeing two different doctors, you know, getting different opinions, a bone specialist and a blood specialist.
- They work together.
- No, I'd rather not.
Why?
What have we got to lose?
I believed in you.
You know I did.
I really needed to believe in you.
But every time you discovered something new about me, something worse happened, and I got sick of hearing that it would all go away as soon as we got down to the basic problem, as though it was in me.
It is in you, Carla.
I think you better leave.
- Hi, Billy.
- Hi.
- Billy. Billy!
- Yeah?
- Look, would you do me a favor?
- What?
Don't pretend next time.
The next time your mother thinks she sees something or she hears something, she wants you to corroborate it, and when you do, it's that much more difficult to convince her that it's all in her head, it's a delusion.
I didn't get a broken arm by pretending.
Look, Billy, there's a lot of logical explanations that could have caused something like this.
All I'm telling you, that is, if you care about your mom, you will not pretend next time.
I care about my mother, yeah.
But I was not pretending.
I'm not lying to you.
Want to know why she's not coming back?
- Mmmmm.
- She's fallen in with some schmucks who are supporting her fantasies.
You ought to see her house.
They're watching her visitations, got it all wired to look for poltergei--
- Entities.
- Wait a minute.
That's what they called it, an entity.
- What schmucks?
- I don't know.
They say they're from the university here. parapsychology.
Ooh.
A Dr. Cooley.
- Elizabeth Cooley.
- Yeah. parapsychology.
It's fly-by-night psychology.
Okay. So how do we get rid of 'em?
Well, not very easily.
I mean, these are not snake-oil peddlers, Phil.
These are supposedly academic brethren.
Academic brethren, bullshit.
Come on. They're dangerous.
They're feeding her delusion.
By the time they get through with her, she's really going to be off her rocker or worse.
Well, there's not much you can do, not legally or medically.
It's her life, her house, her delusions.
No, until she crosses the line of legal sanity, nobody can touch her.
Come on.
Come on, show yourself, you coward.
Now that I've got my forces here with me, let's just see how brave you are.
Is that all you got the guts to do?
A couple of itty-bitty lights?
Come on.
We don't want fireworks.
We want you!
Show yourself, damn you!
Are you trapped in this environment?
Will you appear to us now?
You won't appear.
You won't appear, because you're a devil out of hell, and you're afraid.
You'll wait till I'm alone, won't you?
Then you'll come forth to hurt me, to hurt my children.
Show yourself.
Show yourself.
Joe, turn on the lights.
Did you see it?
Yes, Mrs. Moran.
We saw it.
Thank you.
Would you excuse us?
- Is it over?
- For now.
Yeah? Are you okay?
All right. Okay, then I'm going to go to bed, okay?
- Okay.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- I'll see you.
- Good night, Billy.
- Excuse me.
Thank you.
We'll be leaving shortly.
What are you two doing up?
- Is everything okay?
- We heard you, Mommy.
Everything's fine.
Come on.
Well?
I've never seen anything like it before.
Do you think that we were in some kind of hypnotic state and that this was a mass hallucination?
I've always believed that there were several planes of existence, distinct and separate... and we, as human beings, inhabit only one.
Isn't it possible that some sort of external intelligence, some discarnate entity, has crossed into our plane of existence?
How are we going to prove it?
We have to isolate it.
We have to draw it in somehow, find a way to bring it into a controlled situation.
Yeah, me too.
Yeah, me too.
- Put it in.
- Okay, we got it.
Good night, Mrs. Moran.
- Good night, Mrs. Moran.
- Thank you.
We've got some real good ideas on how to proceed.
Thanks a lot.
- You've got the tape, right?
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- Jerry.
- Hi, cutie.
Excuse me.
- What gives?
- Why didn't you call?
I did. Every time, I got a different voice on the line.
What's going on?
Those people are from the university.
The university?
I missed you.
Look at me. I'm shaking.
I think we'd better have a drink.
Got some good wine.
Um, yeah, well, you go ahead.
I don't think I'd really better.
No, no, you're going to have one.
This is my homecoming.
Come on.
What was that all about?
They're trying to help.
- Help who?
- Me.
I don't know what you mean.
I've been sick, Jerry.
Sick? What kind of sick?
Things have come to me... in the night.
- Nightmares, you mean?
- Yeah.
Like nightmares. Exactly.
I mean, those people you saw in the house, they're psychologists.
They're doctors, and they have a theory that there's something in the house that... is keeping me from sleeping, and they're trying to fix it.
Some of them looked pretty young to be doctors.
- Oh, you're mad.
- No, it's not a question of mad.
- Yeah, okay, since you ask.
- Yeah, you're mad.
I mean, who brings a university full of kids into their house because they can't sleep?
You can't sleep, you take a pill.
You go see a regular doctor.
I'm not giving a party, Jerry.
I'm really not.
Hey, all I'm asking for is a simple explanation.
I still don't know what's bugging you.
- Yeah.
- Don't treat me like a jerk.
- I'm not a jerk, okay, Carly?
- I'm sorry.
Trust me. Just tell me what the hell's happening.
I don't know.
I mean, I don't know--
I don't know the difference between what is happening and what I think might be happening.
The only thing I know for certain is that it started when you left.
And I don't say that with any kind of blame or accusation, but that is when it started.
When what started, Carly?
What?
All right.
Okay. I was--
I was attacked.
And it's not happening now, so don't worry, but I was attacked.
You were attacked?
By who? Who attacked you?
- Nobody. Nobody.
- You were attacked?
No, nobody. Nobody.
Nobody you can see.
Oh, God.
This sounds so crazy.
I mean, it was like a horrible dream.
Shit. I don't know how to explain it.
It sounds crazy every time I explain it.
- Ohh.
- It sounds crazy.
God, baby.
Oh, Carla.
Do you know, for a second, you had me worried?
I mean, I thought you were really attacked.
I thought that somebody attacked you.
Honey.
I know why you can't sleep, but I am with you right now.
I will guarantee you that these dreams or nightmares or whatever the hell they are will never bother you again.
Because I'm staying this time.
No more trips.
No more one-night stands, baby.
Starting tonight, it's going to be forever.
Hey.
Let's go to bed.
Huh?
Hey, can we go to your place?
Uh-uh.
Remember, I'm with you, and as long as I am, nothing bad is going to happen.
Do you believe that?
I got something for you.
What? What is this?
You'll see.
Oh.
Aw, it's beautiful.
- Mmm.
- It's pure silk.
It feels good.
Go put it on for me.
Come on.
It's my homecoming.
Put it on.
Look, honey. You know what
I was thinking? If we--
Please. Help me.
Help me.
Help me. Help me.
Help me.
Help me. Help me.
Help me.
Help me. Help me.
Please, help me.
Help me.
Help me. Help me!
Help me.
Help me. Help me.
Help me. Help me.
Help me.
Stop it. Stop it.
- Get off her.
- Help me.
- Help me.
- Stop it!
Stop it!
You son of a bitch!
You fucking bastard!
You son of a bitch!
Dr. Bronstein, Dr. Loomis...
Okay. She's going to be all right.
- Yeah?
- She's still a little shaky, so when you go in, don't stay too long, okay?
- All right.
- Okay. All right. Go in.
Go in.
She's dying to see you.
Make a right at the corner there.
- First right?
- First door on your right.
- Thanks a lot.
- You got it.
Don't stay too long.
Please don't.
Okay, Jerry, she's going to be okay.
It was just a slight concussion.
Thank God for that, Doctor.
Thank God.
Look, why don't you go in and see her?
She'd like to see you.
No way, Doctor.
I can't be around her.
I can't handle what's going on in there.
Come on, Jerry.
What do you mean you can't handle it?
She needs you now.
I mean, I loved her.
I was going to marry her, you know.
I could've taken anything,
I mean, a disease, cancer.
This is a disease, Jerry.
It's the same thing.
Not what she's got living with her.
Jerry, it's just a disease now, okay?
Now just get it through your head.
It's just in her head.
There was nobody there.
Nobody was there.
Don't tell me that.
There was somebody there.
- Okay. Okay.
- I mean, there was.
Okay, okay.
Take it easy.
I couldn't see him with my eyes, but there was somebody there.
I see this-- like something is pressing her.
It's pushing her.
I see her breasts are being touched.
I mean, I see her breasts are being squeezed by fingers, only I can't see the fingers.
I'm sorry.
That's okay. That's okay.
Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?
We're visiting a friend.
- I got to go now.
- No, no. Oh, Jerry, look.
She needs you now.
She needs you now a lot.
It's okay. It's okay.
I really have to go.
Hey, Jerry--
- Look at me.
- Thanks for calling, Billy.
- Come on.
- No. I want to stay with Mommy.
Come on.
We've got to go.
- I'll talk to you later, Mom.
- Okay.
I hope you're all right,
Mrs. Moran.
I'll be back.
We never should've left the house. I'm sorry.
Maybe this doesn't seem like the best time for this, but we're afraid for you.
We have an idea that might help.
We want to try to isolate this thing and immobilize it.
We need your consent.
That means going into it with your eyes wide open.
What we have in mind has never been tried before.
We'll take every possible precaution.
I'll do anything... to get rid of him.
That guy Jerry was her only contact with reality.
I want those two guys banished from her life.
I don't see what I can do.
Well, go to the dean.
Maybe he can do something.
Maybe he can pull those creeps back.
Do you realize what you're asking?
- That's a month-long debate...
- Right.
And it could get very complicated.
All this for Carla Moran?
Somebody's got to look after her.
Let her go, Phil.
You don't have any choice, professionally or personally.
As you can see, this is a freshly cut rose, and this is a container of liquid helium,
473 degrees below zero.
This is the coldest substance known to man.
Anything frozen at this temperature will shatter at the slightest touch.
What we are seeking is to determine if this entity has mass.
If in fact this is the case, then we should be able to freeze it, verify its objective existence, and prove that it isn't just a psychic projection...
It's going to work great, isn't it?
...but rather an independent force from some other level of reality that has never been isolated.
Here she is.
Mrs. Moran.
Let me take your bag.
It's good to see you.
We're all very excited to get the experiment under way.
- Welcome.
- Mrs. Moran.
See you later.
Have you made arrangements for your children?
- They're with a friend.
- Good.
Let me show you to your new house.
I'm afraid we're not able to provide you with all the conveniences, but we hope you'll find it comfortable
- and familiar.
- Watch your step.
I think everyone's done a terrific job in recreating your home.
We did use different colors on the walls.
And there are other differences.
No light switches.
We have to control the electricity.
This, of course, is the children's room.
Yeah, the bed's in the wrong place.
Well, doesn't matter.
There are no ceilings anywhere in the house.
That's for the television monitoring.
Except, of course, in the bathroom.
There is a ceiling, but no plumbing.
We'll supply you with all the water you need.
That's a chemical toilet.
Does this look familiar?
It's a good simulation.
And remember not to change in here.
The television camera will be watching you, and Gene at the controls.
Now, in the kitchen, we had a bit of a problem.
No gas, but we have a hot plate and a well-stocked refrigerator.
It's like camping out.
Mrs. Moran, I'd like to show you something now.
Looks a lot like your house, doesn't it?
The living room.
Brought your books.
Just stand over here with me.
Mrs. Moran, this is the protected area that we were talking about.
It's two pieces of double-thick, heat-treated glass with a vacuum in between the panes.
Now, the system is fail-safe.
We can't activate the helium until you're safely behind this enclosure, so when we tell you to go to the protected area, we want you to come directly to this spot as quickly as possible, and we'll take care of the rest.
Okay?
Now we have to get ready.
You make yourself as comfortable as you can, but you're not alone.
If you need anything, don't hesitate to ask.
I'm not afraid.
If you can get him,
I'm not afraid.
Hey. Where do you think you're going?
- Is this the Cooley experiment?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm with the Medical
Institute, Dr. Sneiderman.
- Go right on in, Doctor.
- Thank you.
Carla.
I'd like to talk to you alone.
Is there any place that we could go talk?
That we could talk privately?
The bathroom.
This is quite a setup they have.
They made a natural environment for him so he'll come here.
Really? Is that what they're telling you?
That's what they're doing.
Uh-huh.
And you believe them?
Oh, yes.
They're dangerous frauds, Carla.
You're their guinea pig.
Carla, do you know that there are tanks of liquid helium outside?
Did you know that?
- Mm-hmm.
- You do?
Do you know what liquid helium can do?
- Of course.
- Of course. Really?
You understand what it means to stop all molecular motion, paralyze atomic particles, decompose matter?
- Okay,
- Okay?
What do you mean, okay?
I mean I'd rather be dead than living the way
I've been living.
Do you understand that?
Yes, I can understand that.
Yes. I also understand that I care very much what happens to you, very much.
And I know that, in your heart, you know the difference between reality and fantasy.
Carla, look at me. Carla.
Our reason, our intelligence, that's the only thing that distinguishes us between any other species of animal.
Carla, I care about you.
Carla, don't close yourself off now.
It's real important, real important that you maintain contact with at least one person that really cares about you.
- I don't know what you're saying.
- I'll tell you what I am saying, that you and I can make that contact.
I don't want to make that contact.
Okay.
Hey.
Wait up a minute, will you?
Really.
I want to talk to you.
I got to hand it to you.
You just don't give up.
Look, get out, and stay out.
Okay. Now you listen to me,
Buck Rogers, okay?
If you or your trusty sidekick harm one hair on her head...
- Officer.
- I will have your ass in court.
You're going to be looking for your ghosts from prison.
Do you hear me?
You see this face?
I don't want to see it again.
- You got it.
- Hey, Mehan, you may have them all fooled, but not me.
I'm going to nail you and that little creep.
I'll tell him.
Come on. Let's go.
- Yes, sir.
- Come on.
Mrs. Moran, we are now going to move into the nighttime mode.
I want to get it so bad,
I can taste it.
Hang on, Gene.
Hang on.
And pray
Dr. Sneiderman is here with me, Frank.
He tells me Cooley is using some pretty lethal equipment up there.
Liquid helium.
God only knows what all else.
Frank.
Frank, let's not blow our tops.
I'm just trying to sound you out on this.
Yes, I realize it's your decision.
I can't figure him anymore.
Do we really need his approval?
You need to learn a lot about campus politics.
Fuck campus politics.
Where are you going?
I'm going to get her away from those lunatics.
Why not give her the option of tripping that glass enclosure
- herself from down there?
- Too dangerous.
Hey!
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Carla!
- Hey!
- Carla?
- Carla!
- What?
Carla, come on. We're getting out of here right now.
No, I'm not.
- Don't do that. Let go of him.
- Get him out of here!
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Take it easy.
Nobody has to be hurt.
Let him go, Officer.
What is it you want, Doctor?
I want her out of here, Doctor.
That is not going to happen.
If you want to watch this experiment, you go up to the booth.
We have nothing to hide.
I'm very sorry this had to happen, Mrs. Moran.
Everything is going to be all right.
Yeah. I just don't like to see anybody...
- Just try to calm yourself.
- hurt.
He's going to be upstairs with us in the booth.
Just try to get some rest.
That's the important thing.
Okay.
Okay. Okay.
Weber. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, all right, Elizabeth.
Take it easy.
I'll come and get him.
He's up those stairs, Doctor.
Thank you.
- Someone open a door?
- He's here.
Mrs. Moran, move to the protected area.
Mrs. Moran, move to the protected area.
Mrs. Moran, move to the protected area.
To the protected area.
Don't be alarmed, Mrs. Moran.
We're moving into the emergency mode.
Don't activate the compressor yet, Joe.
- I didn't.
- What do you mean, you didn't?
It's been tripped.
Oh, my God.
- What have you got?
- It's no good.
Let's run it in parallel.
All right.
All right, bastard.
I've finished running.
So do what you want.
Take your time, buddy.
Take your time.
Really, I'm thankful for the rest.
I'm so... tired of being scared.
So it's all right, it really is.
It's all right.
You can... do anything you want to me.
You can torture me, kill me, anything.
But you can't have me.
You cannot touch me.
That's mine.
For God sakes.
Carla!
We got it.
We got him trapped.
Oh, my God.
Carla?
Carla?
We lost it.
We got nothing.
That's not true.
We got something.
We have a witness.
Isn't that so?
What?
You did see it, didn't you?
Something.
I--
I saw something.
But I don't know.
I just don't know.
With all that going on down there, it could have been anything.
You son of a bitch.
Welcome home... cunt
We made it. Come on.
Okay, let's close it.
Good.
Now let's get these in.
- Mommy!
- Mommy!
Carla, how in the world did you beat us over here?
We left right after you called.
Carla, take this.
Mmm. I'll pay you back.
I promise you.
- No.
- Thank you.
It's a gift.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
- Take care of yourself.
- Bye, Cindy.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye,
- See you.
- Lock the door, girls.
Lock your door.
Lock your door.
THE GRILLING
I see.
It works when it wants to.
New Year's Eve, 9 p.m.
Hi.
Can I help you?
My car's been stolen.
You're the third.
And certainly not the last.
The others can go hang.
What if I had that attitude?
Mr?
Jabelain.
Jean-Marie Jabelain.
Good evening Sir.
I do apologise.
There was a traffic jam at St-Jean.
Has it cleared yet?
No.
Where's the other one?
He went for a coffee.
I asked him to bring me one...
I'm not sure he heard me.
He's a bit like you, your partner... he only hears what he wants to.
That's not true.
My rule is both to listen... and write down everything.
Hopefully, this case will soon be cleared up.
What's that?
Did you walk on this table?
No, it's the other one, he -
Incidentally, your Chief Superintendent... a handsome fellow, he is.
They say he even wears a wig.
Is that true?
I know I sound bitter when I say
I didn't receive an invitation this year.
Maybe it was lost in the mail...
Are you disappointed?
Yes, such elegant parties.
Kissing under mistletoe, the best jokes...
Ladies can bring their jewellery, dance with their lovers, then introduce them to their husbands.
Are you married, Detective?
Yes. I was.
Three times.
Apparently I'm boring.
Please take a seat.
It is strange that we've troubled you... on New Year's Eve.
We just need to clarify some details, especially concerning the dog.
Mrs Martinaud isn't expecting you?
No...
My wife's not waiting.
Good Evening Belmont.
Do you want it?
What about Mr Martinaud's coffee?
It's here.
If this is for Mr Martinaud, then fine... it's better I don't have it.
I'm stressed enough.
Thanks all the same.
We were about to talk about the dog.
Yes. Wait, which dog?
I'm afraid we're going to do this one to death...
So am I... although in terms of the dog,
I have to understand your statement.
Let see...
On the evening of
December the third...
You take a walk with
Mr and Mrs Brunet's dog.
Is that true?
Yes it is.
The same routine each night.
I'm fond of dogs.
If you like them, why don't you have any yourself?
My wife doesn't like them.
She prefers cats.
- You have a cat?
- No, they're too messy.
My wife would like a cat without the mess.
A cat makes less mess than a dog.
Canaries are the messiest of all.
She didn't want any, but I stood my ground.
Sometimes, it works...
Yes...
The canary, the neighbor's dog...
What's his name again?
Brunet.
- No, the dog.
- Tango.
Right. Tango. An Irish setter.
Good sense of smell, those dogs...
Aren't they retrievers?
You bet. And very good ones.
Only if they go hunting.
Tango is more of a house dog.
Tango.
You spell it like doing a 'tango'?
Well...
How do you want to spell it?
Like 'paso doble' ?
In all your statements you say...
'When I found the body'.
You never mention the dog.
So what?
The dog should have found the body.
Sorry. My mistake.
And I studied that file all evening!
While in traffic jams...
No, you're right.
Mr Brunet said... you weren't with Tango that evening.
Usually you are, but not on that evening.
Not on the third.
Old Brunet is talking nonsense.
He drinks.
All right, but...
Mrs Faure, the shop owner at number 12... must be talking nonsense too.
So is Marcel Esperu at number 19...
In the whole neighborhood... you're the only one talking sense?
Who should I believe?
Them.
You know Sir...
I have nothing against you.
Not the slightest resentment.
I would even say no feelings at all.
It would be too hard to have an opinion... of everyone who came through here.
That shows... a certain kind of dedication.
Mr Martinaud,
Two little girls were raped and killed, eight days apart.
I want to know who did it.
If it is you or someone else,
I swear I don't care.
Don't say that. It's not true.
- Yes it is.
- Not true!
If an arab or a nigger rapes little girls... it's an ordinary story.
But if it's me, Mr Martinaud... public notary and lawyer, it's unheard of in a cop's career.
Newspapers, interviews...
TV if all goes well... true?
Confess!
Let's not reverse roles here!
Right, let's say
I am obsessed by ambition.
But Brunet, Mrs Faure and Esperu, why do they condemn you?
Because I'm rich,
I have a nice house and a lovely wife.
As it happens,
I don't deserve any of it.
My mind and body are only average...
Mediocre people resign themselves... when exceptional people succeed.
They applaud the gifted, the champions.
But success for one of them... it just gets on their nerves.
It strikes them as an injustice.
I'm sure you've received anonymous letters.
No more than usual.
No... well, not a lot more.
If Frenchmen like to write to the police, what can I do?
Yes, I received letters, loads of them.
About tax evasion, real estate fraud, little things like that.
And two rapes, of course.
And some of those letters even suggest... that your wife was the instigator.
And in others, a simple spectator.
But none of the letters mention your mediocrity.
Eccentricity, yes. But not mediocrity.
Anyhow, two witnesses testified... you were without the dog on the third.
- No.
- How's that?
May I?
They don't say there's no dog... they say they didn't notice it.
It's underlined.
Belmont, come here.
What's all this mess?
He's right.
They don't say the dog wasn't there... they just say they didn't notice it.
Isn't that the same?
No. Not at all.
They say they didn't notice...
That could mean it was there... or it wasn't, right?
Sorry, but... does it matter?
If the dog was there, it should have found the body.
Again, does it really matter?
True, does it matter?
It's not the dog that called us, right?
I didn't help it make the call!
Tell me, Detective...
When I was summoned,
I was told it would be for a short time only.
I've been here for an hour now!
Nobody cares if I had something else to do... but I have.
Well, I did have.
I'm afraid, Sir, that this affair... will drag on a little longer than expected.
If you want to call home, please do so...
Dial 0 for the switchboard.
Let's go, Belmont?
Here, Mercier.
Where do we go from here?
And thanks for the trick:
'Come on Belmont, that's not what's written'.
You want me to play the fool?
Do you have some change?
Why are you fooling around with that dog?
It makes no sense.
A rich lawyer that accepts spending...
New Year's Eve with cops... makes no sense either.
Nothing does.
In your opinion, is he guilty or not?
When I read the file, yes... but face to face
I'm not so sure. There.
You can come back.
Nobody answered at home.
You can come back.
Twenty two
Twenty two hours
Twenty two hours zero
Twenty two hours zero fif
No thanks I have my own poison.
If you're thirsty, there's a vending machine in the corridor.
Ask Detective Belmont for change.
Now about little Genevieve Lebailly,
Did you know her a little... or very well?
She was eight. I'm fifty.
A man of my age cannot know an eight year old well.
According to the neighbours, she was a very cheerful girl.
Very spontaneous, right?
Yes, cheerful.
Not in the least suspicious.
Who would have followed anyone.
Yes, anyone... preferably a noted lawyer.
No, I'm not saying that.
Exactly, you're not saying it.
So, what do I type?
'Not in the least suspicious'.
No, type everything.
Questions and answers!
Your questions are so vile... that you're ashamed of them.
From now on,
I insist that everything is written down!
Maybe you'll change your tone!
All right...
Age. Occupation. Marital status!
Shit!
Name and occupation, Martinaud!
- He asked me twenty times!
- Now I'm asking you!
You wanted everything noted, so here we go.
- Your name is Martinaud?
- Yes.
- Jerome!?
Yes, Jerome Charles Emile.
- Notary, 43 De Lattre, Le Bourg, Manche.
- Yes.
- Are you married?
- Yes.
- No children?
- None.
Why? Too messy?
Because my wife can't have children.
She can't, or doesn't want to?
If she can't...
You could adopt.
You already walk someone else's dog.
You're so graceful.
And that, for fuck sake...
Is that graceful?
When police arrived, they found her like that... lying face down.
Face down, yet you recognised her!
Yes, her tracksuit and her hair...
I don't remember.
Typical cop question!
As if you couldn't recognise...
- someone you saw 100 times!
- Of course.
Because of the tracksuit,
I knew it was Wednesday
She went to the stadium every Wednesday.
Wait...
Wednesday, the 3rd... old Brunet is right... he couldn't notice the dog... it was already outside, playing in the field.
Yes...
I called it.
And it followed?
Of course!
Very clever.
Oh yes, very smart.
Tell me, Martinaud.
Seriously... do you know why you are here?
Of course...
You are here under suspicion.
First a witness, now you're a suspect.
One thing leads to another...
There was at some point... a sort of shift, you see?
I'm sure this hasn't escaped your attention.
Not really.
But why the shift? That escapes me.
Two little girls were killed,
Two children.
The first on November 25th at Saint-Clement beach.
The second on December 3 on Jobourg public parkland.
That's near your place.
It happens that, unfortunately for you, on the day of the first murder you were in the vicinity, and on the evening of the second you are... centre stage: the first to find the body.
And the first to call police.
Frankly Sir, those walls would not be sufficient... to carve out the names of the murderers... who supposedly 'discovered' their victim's bodies.
Which makes perfect sense since... they are the first to know.
Your idea of civic duty is very personal.
I can't remember the person who said -
You don't remember a lot!
'Safety ends once you...'
'enter a police station'.
Even dialling your phone number inspires fear.
If you don't mind, let's temporarily put aside the phone call...
Why?
The operator identified my voice.
Correct.
At last, evidence that's in my favour... and you ignore it.
Just for now, the Detective decided.
Thanks Belmont.
Very well.
And now?
What shall we talk about?
Dogs? Birds?
The first murder, if you please.
Saint Clement, the dunes.
It's wasn't that long ago... 6 weeks.
The morning of November the 25th...
A Tuesday...
South side beach.
We find a child's body,
Pauline Valera, 8 years old.
Raped, murdered... strangled to death.
It must have happened in the bunker.
She ran, and the killer caught her at the beach.
The same day, we find your car illegally parked at the harbour.
Less than a kilometre from the dunes.
It must have been there all night...
A policemen noted the time between 7 and 7.20 a.m.
The policemen's watches differed by a few minutes.
You don't disagree at this point?
I'm saying nothing.
We found the girl's body half an hour later.
The watches decided to agree now.
I don't know what's keeping me... from smashing this typewriter in his face.
Regulations Belmont... simply regulations.
Honestly Sir, if it was not for those damn rules...
You questioned me about that 100 times... and I answered 100 times.
Since we're not in Scotland Yard, please allow me to explain to you gentlemen, that you're beginning to give me the shits!
This diversion is not really important for the record.
Maybe not.
It's up to you.
Your car was at the harbour. Right?
But where were you, during that time?
At the pub, or my sister's place.
I don't remember.
Ah yes, I forgot the pub.
Your sister... The pub...
Unfortunately the pub's owner... didn't remember seeing you... at all.
And as for visiting your sick sister...
Gallbladder sickness.
You know how these alibis work:
'You have no relationship with the defendant' etc.
Even without the word 'defendant', there's the family connection...
If Jeanine cannot testify, why did he question her?
Because I'm a cop.
Why did he harass her just before her operation?
Which, between you and me... was very thoughtful indeed.
The doctor allowed me 5 minutes.
Is there trouble between you two?
It's been a while since your last visit.
We see each other less since her wedding.
What does the wedding have to do with anything?
Detective Belmont certainly has his suspicions.
Your sister married a painter?
- A painter, yes.
- Mr Van...
Van Kempen. Jos Van Kempen.
Not bad paintings too.
You've seen his work?
Just a few paintings...
Yes it's because of him that you can't see your sister.
Until this visit at Saint-Clement.
I see her secretly.
Away from her husband?
No.
That's right, your wife didn't go with you.
She must have had other things on that day.
My sister and her don't get on very well.
You mean... at all?
It's complicated.
Very complicated.
It was fine at first.
They would go to the movies, exhibitions...
They got on quite well.
Then Jos... started to sell lots of paintings... and from there... how can I put it...
Your wife was jealous of your sister.
She had an affair with the painter.
She thought he was the kind of man... she should have had married.
An artist rather than a businessman.
Exactly.
Someone who's talked about.
You may soon be talked about, Mr Martinaud.
Tell me, was it before or after your sister's visit... that you went to this pub?
After.
I was upset to find
Jeanine gaunt and tired.
I went for a drink and didn't pay attention...
I parked in the wrong place.
And the wrong time.
How much time did you stay in this pub?
I didn't pay attention.
Less than 1 hour.
And then?
Then I returned to my sister.
Right away?
Almost...
But not quite, Martinaud.
First you went to the lighthouse.
Isn't Saint-Clement lighthouse splendid?
Yes, that's true...
I went to the lighthouse.
To get some fresh air?
As you say the lighthouse is splendid... so I went to see it.
There's people from Paris that -
Okay! You saw the lighthouse.
Then what?
Then?
Then? I already told you what I did!
I left my car at the harbour,
I went back to my sister's place.
- 12, Lorientais Street.
- By the beach?
The beach?
You get to Lorientais Street from the lighthouse... via the beach.
Yes... that's obvious.
What's less obvious is Pauline Valera's body.
The person who did that had to go along the beach...
He had to pass along the beach just like the person... who raped Genevieve Lebailly did...
You disgust me!
Why 'The person who did that'...
'The Culprit', 'The Murderer' ?
Give this ghost a name.
Say 'Mr Martinaud, The Lawyer'... since you're so sure of it.
Not quite Martinaud, not quite...
And incidentally, that's why you're still here.
I'm here because I want to be.
Because the other one asked me to.
Now, I'm leaving!
Sit down, Sir.
You're not leaving now.
What do you mean I'm not leaving.
Take care gentlemen... you don't have many options left.
Either you release me, hold me in custody, or take me before a Judge.
I don't know about you, but I'm inclined to choose custody.
You can make a phone call.
- To whom?
- Anyone.
Your lawyer, for instance.
You can call him, but he can't come here.
That's how it is.
I don't have a lawyer.
At least, not any more.
A 3 spades story... double and down.
Tomorrow if you see the Judge... you'll need a lawyer.
Mr Kellman who pleaded my last divorce is brilliant.
I lost...but he was brilliant.
If you want a life sentence,
I have his number.
Or, Detective Belmont will give you a list.
Surely you know some of them.
There's a Chinese one this year if you're interested.
I already have one.
My acupuncturist.
I want to see you go free, Martinaud.
I don't know why.
I know. I make you laugh.
No. You can irritate me... surprise me... even persuade me...
But while I still think you killed 2 children,
You have no chance to make me laugh Martinaud.
A red dot means 'available at night'.
Close your eyes and pick one at random.
Perhaps not in your best interest.
You should try to call home.
Maybe someone will answer.
No.
Do you think it's normal?
And you, are you normal?
Spending New Year's Eve talking about rape, murder... mind your own business!
I'll call if I feel like it.
Henri?
Thanks, you too pal.
Happy New Year.
Tell me...
Did someone call Jobourg from Room 24 a moment ago?
Yes, wait...
Thanks, Henri.
Please empty your pockets.
Eh... what... are you mad?
Everything... on the table.
You can sit down Sir.
You too Belmont.
Your wife?
I didn't imagine her like that.
Nor me.
Too bad you didn't come to Blvd. De Lattre.
You could have understood.
I was there!
But you... you understood nothing.
Try to remember...
The place's topography, as you would say.
Downstairs there's...
No, upstairs.
It's more informative upstairs.
I didn't see anything exciting!
Mr Martinaud didn't say exciting, but informative.
Thanks.
Upstairs...
- there's a corridor.
- Yes.
- A long corridor.
- Fifteen metres!
- Possibly...
- Definitely!
Three bedrooms...
If I remember two large, one small.
A child's room, a guest room and ours.
The child's room remained empty.
The guestroom is now my wife's.
Ours became my room.
Between these two rooms is a fifteen metre corridor.
Many things can keep a couple apart:
Adultery, sickness, death...
I am separated from my wife by a corridor.
A fifteen metre corridor.
Just that...
Well, just... a fifteen metre wasteland!
And at the end of that wasteland...
A locked door.
Surely you don't know what it's like... to knock on a door that will not open.
Another coffee?
Yes.
This time can I have one?
Can I get up too?
Impressive!
Really, very funny.
'Another coffee'?
You're not going to trick me into a friendly chat!
You really think I'm a fool!
On the contrary...
I think you're very smart Martinaud.
A first-class con-man...
I question you about the rape and murder of two girls... and the conversation moves to your wife, a corridor, a door...
Alright, why not.
Now that you've led me to this door... you must open it.
I want to know what's behind it.
You know that very well.
Don't you prefer to tell it in your own words?
So many nights I thought about those words.
Be my guest.
All right.
I'll tell you what's behind this door.
It's Mrs Martinaud.
Chantal Martinaud... she that refuses you her bed.
And since when?
Months? Years?
Maybe since the beginning?
Don't push it!
So, when?
Right in the middle of our honeymoon.
And what about that, my dear friend?
The novelty that was our sex life broke down almost immediately.
5 or 6 weeks of mad ecstasy... hiding in hotels, it was fun.
And such a novelty for me.
I felt I was living on the edge...
Depraved acts... that would occupy my mind... when I was back in my office seeing clients.
Until the day that Chantal... asked for my hand in marriage.
Well... me...
I'd never have dreamed...
So it was her.
She proposed?
You don't know her.
It's never that simple.
She tends to constantly meander.
- And so?
- So !?
Marriage...
Venice...
Hotel Danieli... yes...
That's where all broke down.
The young bride started to have migraines... and thought I had obsessive thoughts.
My so-called perversity astonished her...
But... her amazement was shortlived.
There was disgust... repugnance... it became... slowly gangrenous.
Anyway, back to Blvd De Lattre...
I was at the end of the corridor... with my toothbrush.
Do you see the picture?
I see, yes.
What do you see?
What Mr Gallien?
Absolutely nothing!
You know why?
You have determined your own version of the story... while I explain another!
But you are not here for the other one.
I don't give a damn about
Mrs Martinaud's migraines, your toothbrush, or Mr Martinaud naked in the corridor!
What I see is a longer corridor... darker... with Pauline Valera and
Genevieve Lebailly at the end!
I want this corridor to take me to that beach... to the field at Jobourg... and to the murderer!
Detective, let me tell you something...
If I had the guts to kill...
I would not choose little girls.
Oh no!
Did you ever want to kill?
Detective Belmont, sometimes...
Never one of your three wives?
The first one, maybe...
Not really...
She made superb flower bouquets.
You don't kill a woman who loves flowers.
I don't see why not...
- Here's Tintin!
- How's it going?
We're making progress.
Listen Martinaud, everybody's tired... so let's not waste time.
Let's go.
Right!
So...
Little Valera's body was found at 8 a.m.
According to the pathologist... she'd been dead for 5 hours.
That works out about 3 a.m.
But... you were still admiring the lighthouse.
Seriously!
Do you see me at a lighthouse at 3 a.m.?
Not me... but I would be happier if someone saw you.
Your sister doesn't remember when you were back.
Nor can I!
You don't notice that.
Not all the time.
Tell me... during your stroll...
Was the lighthouse lit up?
Of course!
Else I wouldn't have seen it.
Such a horrible fog...
Not even fit for a dog.
Yet suitable enough for a lawyer... and of course you met no-one.
No.
And you heard nothing?
Yes... only crashing waves.
Ah, waves yes...
Nothing else?
No.
No voices? Nobody?
I don't remember.
And you expect me to believe you?
I don't give a fuck!
Hey! I'm not a printing press.
To summarize, you didn't hear or see anything.
I did!
An extraordinary racket!
A drunkard, somewhere wanting to reconquer Algeria.
Waves, the sea... and seagulls...
No!
Why not seagulls?
Because at that hour, seagulls... are sleeping!
From the moment nobody saw you enter... and nobody saw you leave, how long was it?
1 hour? Half an hour?
About that.
Enough time to rape and strangle Pauline Valera.
A hard-on in that cold weather, that's amazing!
His comment makes sense.
A point for the defense.
Very very funny!
I promise that on the day they recontruct the crime everything will be exposed!
Funny! Really!!
Isn't that enough?
What?
I asked whether you were done, you idiot!
All right...
Actually, I'm glad you mentioned the weather...
Thanks Belmont.
Ignoring Detective
Belmont's remark...
Very funny, really...
Excellent! Really.
Isn't it strange to be about... in the middle of the night in such weather?
Even stranger for an 8 year-old.
The Valera girl had to be there... so I could kill her... right?
Can you spare a cigarette...
Please, Detective?
No!
You're not a very good sport.
But I don't play, Martinaud.
My questions are not for you... to win a packet of soap powder... or a plane ticket... but to put you away for life.
In jail, or an asylum with other nuts.
I'll ask you for the third time:
Did you hear anything while at the lighthouse?
Yes?
Come in, damn it!
Sorry... can you come at once?
Can you excuse me for a moment?
Be my guest... bad timing.
Take your coat, it's the boss.
Tell me, Detective...
What was I supposed to hear... at this damn lighthouse?
The fog horn Mr Martinaud.
The fog horn.
Your boss is thrilled. For once!
He didn't get far with the little dog.
And for Miss Valera being outside at 3 a.m... that was no success either!
But... the fog horn... really...
My hat goes off to you, Detective!
Well...
For now!
How do you explain that?
The appearance and color of caviar... so why isn't it caviar?
Please.
Please excuse me.
- Good evening Gallien.
- Good evening Sir.
Do you want a drink? Some food?
I guess I'm not here for that.
Of course not.
You've held him for 3 hours...
'Held him' is a laugh...
He's as slippery as a eel.
I've noticed that perverts... have a remarkable intellect...
How else would they dream it up?
Those are police symbols...
Border patrol...
You have the badge for this one?
'The Valera girl had to be there'...
'so I could kill her'.
When did I stop typing?
When he called you an idiot.
I admire you Martinaud.
We discuss children being raped and strangled, and you make jokes.
'Strangled and raped'.
I just said that.
You said 'raped and strangled'.
I disagree with 'raped and strangled',
But I agree with 'strangled and raped'.
I agree... maybe.
You should be careful.
In my case, it's not important... but you have to ask questions in the correct order.
Mr Belmont.
Otherwise...
What?
Closing up?
Perhaps the girl led you to the dunes...
True...
The young sluts of today... grow to become big sluts... and later, old sluts!
You're obsessed with sluts!
They don't interest me.
It's how you achieved it.
Old ones, no problem... but youngsters...they run fast!
Tell me...
Come on...
How did you do it?
Touch them, like that?
No?
Not like that?
You tell them
'what's your name kitty'?
'Pauline'...
'So sweet, so cute!'.
You hurt me!
You hurt them too.
You're crazy!
Who's the crazy one!
Don't be too rough...
Only detain him as a last resort.
Tell me... the squeaking... is worse than last year.
Don't tell me he's already in custody?
He is.
For an hour and a half already.
Oh dear...
I know, but he was ready to bugger off!
You killed them both, bastard!
Wait for the other one...
You did this to them... or this?
Where are you going?
Little girls... You bastard...
Small butts... You scum!
I'm going to really mess you up!
Mr Gallien... is not back yet?
What do you want!
Fuck you!
Fuck them alright!
That's enough, I'm out of here.
- No!
- I want out, damn it!
Martinaud!
Where's he going?
Come on...
Shit! Let me go!
Martinaud don't be a fool!
Come on, damn it!
Don't move!
No need to panic like that.
What happened?
Calm down.
I didn't hurt you, right?
Move! There's nothing to see.
Shit! Let me go!
I'm a minor, and I'll fuck you up!
Charming. Who's that?
Berthier's son.
Berthier?!
He nicked that car, the Japanese one.
He wrecked it on
Edgar Quinet Blvd.
You father will be pleased.
Except for bikes, Japanese is crap.
This bomb was useless.
You should have stolen a bike.
And how did you wreck it?
Ramming a streetlight.
I would have prefered a cop, a family man...
A fatty like you.
Look, I'm not fat,
I'm just well covered
Antoine!
What?
What's up with you?
It's the 'Night of the Long Stress'.
Why do you say that?
Because Belmont plastered Martinaud!
Here.
Looks bad..
A fine mess...
He made a fine mess...
Not to mention the kicks.
I can't breathe.
Do we call a doctor?
He can ask for the doctor.
Better call a radiologist...
I'm sure my nose is broken.
Give me that, I'll manage.
Can't you just leave me in peace?
You're crowding...
I just told you I can't breathe!
Fuck off!
He's right. Move away!
You too Belmont.
What, me too?
Haven't you done enough, already?
What is it?
Have I got small pox or something?
Look at those two-faced bastards!
Aren't they nice?
Not as nice as you!
Because if he had cracked... you would have a signed confession now.
Great for everyone!
Yeah, but he didn't crack.
Bad luck.
Your only hope now is that I'm guilty.
Because if I was the murder, then you just roughed up a sadist, and that's OK.
But if I'm innocent... then you are the sadists.
Fine!
Trouble brewing, gentlemen?
Listen Martinaud...
What do you want, an apology?
OK then. I officially disapprove... of Mr Belmont's methods. Happy?
No way!
Where's the damn list of lawyers!
You intend to file a complaint?
You bet. Assault before witnesses.
What witnesses?
For a little scratch?
I think I prefer Belmont.
What?
I prefer Belmont!
There's two kinds of cops:
Straight and twisted.
And you're twisted!
I'll tell you why...
Your fog horn trick... that was really twisted!
If I didn't hear it, it means I was elsewhere?
True! I was elsewhere!
But not where you think I was!
I was not on Saint Clement dunes!
I was... with a whore! There!
Right! A whore!
I have life outside corridors...
I go visit whores.
They're Chantal's opposite.
Whores give out plenty... for relatively little money.
Precisely!
Midnight.
Happy New Year, Antoine.
Happy New Year, buddy.
I guess we don't kiss...
I'll tell him...
You forget something?
Mrs Martinaud just arrived.
Asking for her husband.
What do we say?
What do we say Martinaud?
It's OK...
I'll see what I can do.
They left you in the dark, Madam?
There.
Is that better?
My husband's been here hours, Detective.
I know Madam...
I'm afraid we're not done yet...
Did you arrest him?
No, we just took him into custody.
Can I ask why?
I'm not sure I have to answer that... but you must know already.
Usually I enjoy humour, but I find yours contemptible.
I've come to see my husband and I demand...
You're in no position to insist Madam.
Please excuse me...
I don't normally talk this way.
What's to stop me seeing my husband?
Nothing Madam, except for one small detail.
He doesn't want to see you.
Won't you take off your coat?
Yes.
Please.
A warm drink? Coffee? Tea?
I'd like some tea, thanks.
Henri?
Can you send a tea to Room 60?
What? Yes tea!
Tea! You know what it is, right?
Alright. Thanks.
Are you sure you won't sit down?
You know... it was I who switched off the light.
Thank you.
Sorry.
You wanted to talk to me Mrs Martinaud.
So let's talk...
About what?
Me, for instance.
You mean your marriage?
That's not a word that comes to mind.
Because of the two rooms?
Ah... he told you about that.
And what else?
Venice...
De Lattre Blvd... the corridor...
I see.
For you perhaps... for me, it's still unclear.
From what I understand... based on your husband's account, wouldn't it be simpler... just to separate?
Or divorce?
How long have you been here Mr Gallien?
6 years.
So you know the city well enough...
You'll understand if I tell you that before my marriage,
I was living in St Louis district.
That's nice.
The odd-numbered side, you appreciate.
Surely even better.
Don't be fooled.
It's not a sign of wealth, but one of status.
You'll find the money on De Lattre Boulevard.
Our dinner was often just a slice of ham, but my parents would never have moved.
But all that is foreign to you, of course?
For 35 years, my parents lived... in the same two-room flat... in the 20th District of Paris.
They could never move either. So...
Not to be rude... but your wedding, we can hardly call it an error of youth.
Youth? No.
When I left school I had choices...
Work... What sort?
Marriage... To whom?
To sleep around.
In our families, there's always a friend of father... to take you skiing at Ibiza.
You were old enough.
Oh, more than enough.
I had my mother's gift of piano... and naive ideas about love...
And along came
Prince Charming, right?
All I did was fullfil the dream... of well educated bitches.
To marry Jerome Martinaud.
PHD in public law, heir of Martinaud study.
Sole heir?
And his sister?
He has a sister, right?
Poor thing...
He left her some royalties and a shack.
In Saint Clement?
He told you much...
Not everything.
I'm afraid the most interesting part... still lies in shadows...
Martinaud is vile... when he ceases to be a lawyer... vile...
Is poor Martinaud such a problem in his corridor?
Because Madam, despite your efforts... to have him beheaded, your husband... in the eyes of the law, is still innocent.
Please let's not play with words...
Too bad, it can be amusing.
Like 'conjugal duties'.
Martinaud uses it often.
He says you've never done your duty... as willingly as before you were married. True?
True.
Maybe because it was not a duty yet.
An investment?
Why are you becoming vulgar?
Please excuse me.
Do you mind?
Yes, if I'm not smoking.
Sorry.
Thanks.
Your husband claims... that it was during your honeymoon... that the marriage became gangrenous.
He used this word: 'gangrenous'.
And on his return from Venice, his things were at the end of the corridor.
True?
False!
Since when did you sleep in separate rooms?
Christmas Eve, 10 years ago.
You see, almost an anniversary.
Today, he is afraid.
He's one of those men who hope... things will improve, as long as you don't talk about them.
He's right.
To hope?
To be afraid.
A mandarin?
No thanks.
We used to spend all Christmas... with my brother and his wife at Louvier.
It was because of their child, Camille.
We have no children, and... at that time she was... how should I say... a charming little girl.
There's children like that... who have something magical... a distinctive grace...
It was a pleasant evening, we were all perfectly happy... as a family should be during Christmas.
Camille was opening her presents...
Father Christmas spoiled her.
She was delighted, a bit too exited maybe.
Jerome was spending time with her.
He only had eyes for her.
My sister-in-law had done a wonderful job... organising everything.
Her taste is a bit provincial... but it seems they are happy like that.
Jerome was still chatting with the child... nobody paid attention.
Nobody was looking after them.
All in all, a simple family reunion.
A quiet party.
I sorted out gifts with my sister-in-law.
Books she'll never read,
Jewellery I'll never wear.
Everyone had left the dining room, except for Jerome and Camille.
I'd left a present behind... and went to get it for no real reason... unless you call it intuition.
There they were.
He was talking, she was listening.
I couldn't hear the words but it was... how can I say...
He was talking to her as to a woman.
She seemed to understand.
Then he must have felt my presence.
I remember Camille.
Her smile.
He had no right to make her smile like that.
In short you continued to live together... at opposite ends of the corridor.
Such things were never a problem for me.
The physical aspect of marriage.
If a woman decides it doesn't matter...
And even if I had chosen... to normalise relations... there are images you never forget.
Mrs Martinaud,
Everything you just said... could explain a certain behaviour.
But Madam, I am a detective.
And to charge
Jerome Martinaud with two murders,
I need proof.
I have it.
And he listens to her!
She is talking nonsense... and he's listening!
Can I please go to the toilet and cut my wrists?
You laugh about it, but it happens.
At such an hour, a man doesn't know if he's joking or dreaming, or what he's doing.
Detective?
Could I ask you for your opinion now?
My opinion Madam doesn't matter... because it will never change yours, will it?
Mr Martinaud says he'll cut his wrists.
Now what!
What did Chantal Martinaud tell you?
Do you like mudbaths, Sir?
Mudbaths...
What rubbish has she been telling you?
Why didn't you come in!
You could have heard everything but you refused.
Make up your mind!
Do you know what you want?
Yes.
I know what I want to know, and what you don't want me to know.
Fine! To clear our minds,
Let's go back to that evening, on the 3rd.
The Valera evening?
No, the Lebailly evening.
Not my favorite.
Isn't it over already?
Not really.
That's why I asked if you like mudbaths.
You found little Genevieve in a ditch, right?
How was the weather, that evening?
A weather report, now.
Do you remember this big storm during the day?
This ditch must have been filthy... was it?
I'm not sure...
You have so much space for your walk... and you end up there.
Of course!
I saw the body.
Really?
But... how could you see it Martinaud?
Did you have stilts?
No, not that day.
Nothing is visible from the parklands. Not a thing!
There's bushes and nettles that high!
I'm sorry but I don't follow.
How's that?
I don't follow your reasoning, that's all.
Of course you can...
Your following my reasoning very closely!
The parklands, nettles, the ditch, the body... and the wood.
Why is it that you never talked about the wood?
And you, why can't you tell me what my wife said?
There was dead leaves under the girl's shoes. dead leaves fall from trees.
There's only one tree in the parklands... and it is dead.
So the child came from the wood.
- And you?
-Me?
You came from
Jobourg or the wood?
I don't know!
Make up your mind Martinaud!
Dead leaves, the wood, Jobourg... it's becoming surreal!
Even more surreal than that... is Mr Martinaud going back home in a hurry!
Sorry?
Why did you run back home?
I found the body!
Why home?
To make a phone call!
There's two phone booths on that land.
So why run back home?
I don't know...
I was in shock! There!
Your wife... did she hear you coming in?
I don't know if she heard me or not...
She doesn't care.
She's not interested.
Ok.
You're back home the phone is there... and you go upstairs. Why?
To go to the bathroom.
To phone?
I wanted to puke!
I had the shits!
Happy now?
Because of the shock?
Yes, that's why.
Probably because of that.
Tell me Martinaud...
How many raincoats do you have?
Like this one. How many?
Two.
Two!
Exactly the same?
Of course!
There are two kinds of raincoats:
With or without a belt,
I prefer them with.
They suit me better.
Not feeling well?
I'm fine, my friend. Really I am.
Carry on.
You're very pale.
I'm fine Gallien, really.
Speak for yourself.
You're not that sparkling either.
Stop beating around the bush!
On the evening of the third...
What do you want to know?
Be precise!
What were you doing in the wood?
In the wood, and also at Saint-Clement.
I've already had the pleasure of telling you, that I was with at whore.
OK Martinaud, what's the girl's name... and the name and address of the hotel...
There was no hotel...
The whore was 'car cruising'.
'An amazon', as they say.
- Pathetic.
- What?
Your argument. It's pathetic.
It's not an argument, it's an alibi!
Your alibi is pathetic!
You wait until 2 a.m. to confess you went whoring?
You haven't stopped lying since you got here!
A sick sister that you hardly see.
An hour in a pub where nobody recognised you.
A trip to the lighthouse and then, no trip to the lighthouse.
And now an anonymous whore!
Tell me Martinaud,
When will you tell me something I can believe?
She told you about Camille...
Admit it.
Admit that she came to tell you about that night.
A motive to rape children.
She came to speak about Camille... and everything is clear to you now.
You're so lucky.
I am the... the ugly duckling.
The Black Sheep.
Of course it's so much easier to accept that version, than to believe a love story.
What's happening Martinaud?
What's with you?
Where are you going with... your duck, your sheep...
I was only asking about your raincoat.
You're right.
Let's talk about raincoats... they're more important.
They are!
Fortunately, you have two raincoats.
What did you do with the other one?
The other one?
Yes, from the parklands.
I gave it to the police.
No you didn't.
No Martinaud, the one given to the police... was perfectly clean.
No traces of mud or branches.
So what?
You are still lying Martinaud.
You didn't go home to throw up.
You changed your clothes.
Really? Why?
Because there was blood on your raincoat.
Of course. I touched her so that I could identify her.
However, you provided to the police... a perfectly clean raincoat.
And why?
Because the one you wore that night is here!
You have no proof of that.
Yes I have.
The dry cleaner's ticket... that your wife fetched herself.
Murder on Thursday... dry cleaners the next day.
A spotless murderer with impeccable clothing.
No, that's not it. It's just...
What Martinaud?
I didn't think... she was capable of that.
Your wife doesn't like you very much, pal.
No. She doesn't.
Not much.
It gets to the point where... it's almost a joke.
Did you kill Valera?
Yes.
And Lebailly?
Yes.
Both of them?
Yes, both.
Both.
Yes.
Killed and raped. It's me.
Are you ready to testify?
That's what I'm doing, right?
Antoine!
Congratulations pal!
You were right to be persistent.
- Tell me?
- Yes.
What happened to Belmont?
Nothing at all.
I guessed as much.
And Martinaud?
Adami's taking a statement.
And then...
Madam...?
Yes.
Is she taking it very hard?
No, she's keeping brave.
Come on.
Come!
Sorry Madam, you'll have to wait 5 minutes, we must unload the car.
I'm in no hurry.
Thank you Madam.
Come on, a bit more...
Come back... stop!
Wait a moment...
Hey!
Take a look.
What's that?
It's blood.
Hey Antoine!
Can you come over here?
Please come here...
Whose car is that?
A man named Jabelin.
He hassled us all night about his stolen car.
And where is he?
Did you let him go?
No, we brought him in... and he's cooling off in the station.
What about Martinaud?
'The Notable Mr Martinaud'!
Mr Gallien is looking after that.
After I carried the body...
No, correction...
I dragged the body...
Detective Gallien prefers
'to drag out'...
I dragged the body from the small woods to the ditch.
What you call 'small woods' is Jobourg's wood?
I need precise naming.
That's fine.
Write 'small woods'...
The small woods in Jobourg.
So he is the real one.
Are you sure?
It's boiling, up there...
I understand...
To confess to two crimes... just to get away from... all this mess.
Without him,
I was the perfect suspect.
All right, that's enough Martinaud.
Do the right thing and get out now.
Take your...
Take your raincoat and get back to your corridor.
That's what you wanted to say.
Clear off Martinaud!
There's...
There's something
I would like to ask.
Just one thing.
If it had been essential... vital... would you have called
Camille to the witness box?
Who is Camille?
Gallien!
January the 1st, 7 a.m.
Subtitles: LeMaudit & rosethorn
That's a really good camera, isn't it?
You gotta be a professional photographer to have that camera.
Are you really?
Oh, that's exciting.
Yeah, sometimes.
- Pays well anyway.
- Are you here on... assignment?
No.
Just a vacation.
Are you famous?
I'm from St. Louis. Photographers don't get famous in St. Louis.
Successful, maybe, but not famous.
What's your name?
- My name is...
- No, no, wait. Let me guess.
You look like a...
Fred.
No, no, let's see.
- Freddie.
- Okay.
- I think you look like a Freddie.
- All right. Okay, okay.
I'll be Freddie, you can be... Lisa.
I've always wanted to meet a Lisa.
That's a really pretty name.
You see, you're a very pretty lady.
Pretty enough to... be a model?
Absolutely.
Now I want you to give me a nice smile, Lisa, okay?
All right, here we go.
Come on, look at Freddie.
That's beautiful.
That's great. That's great.
You're so pretty.
Oh, you're wasting your time here, Lisa.
You are so pretty. Come on, come on, smile at Freddie.
- You like that?
- Great, that's wonderful!
I'm gonna put this in "Playboy".
Yes. Oh, that is nice,
Lisa. Beautiful.
Right in the camera.
Right in the camera.
Come on. Very nice. Very nice.
Have fun. Have fun.
Lisa, Lisa, Lisa.
How's this, Freddie?
That's great.
Do I look good to you, Freddie?
You look wonderful to me.
Do you want me, Freddie?
Right here?
- Hey! What's happening?
- Smile, Freddie.
What are you doing to me?!
Welcome to Potters Bluff.
He's deader than hell.
Hello, Betty?
Come in, Betty!
Go ahead, Unit 1.
Betty, we're still waiting for
Dobbs to show with the meat wagon.
You did call the funeral home...
...didn't you?
- Ten-four, Unit 1.
I reached the funeral home half an hour ago.
Mr. Dobbs said he'd come out just as soon as he could.
You better try him again.
Tell him to hurry it up.
- Unit 1 clear?
- Yes, Betty, Unit 1clear.
Betty and her toys. Nobody else to talk to on that police channel... and she can't call me by my name.
TV cop shows, Harry. They do that.
You think the County'd let me have this rig for salvage?
- Anyhow, she said he's on his way.
- Well, no hurry.
Fella's definitely a goner. Did you get a gander at that face, Danny?
- Yes, Harry. I did.
- Pretty, huh?
Here comes Dobbs.
Talk about an entrance.
- Dobbs, where the h...?
- Just a minute.
- "And The Angels Sing". 1938.
- A little before my time, Dobbs.
Well, Dan, William G. Dobbs is now at your service.
Let me get to work. Here.
...about 3O minutes, I'd imagine.
Well, Mr. Dobbs, as our official coroner/mortician... what'd you say the cause of death was?
- Daniel.
- Morning. Midge, coffee, please.
- Sure, Dan.
- I was telling about that accident.
- Find out who that guy is yet?
- Not a thing. No ID...
...no license plates, nothing.
- Well, old buddy... with the fancy salary the city of Potters Bluff pays you... and the amount of money the State spent getting you educated...
...you should be able to find clues.
- lf you can't solve an accident...
...what'll you do if a crime happens?
- Very funny.
Now, boys, don't be riding Danny here too hard. He's apt to leave us.
We're lucky to have him. He's got a master's degree in criminology... big cities fighting over him, and he comes back to help the poor folks.
That's right. You people are very lucky. Midge! How about that coffee?
- Coming right up, Dan.
- Hospital find out about this fella?
Give you any idea when he might come to?
- They're not sure he will.
- My God! It's just awful!
Just terrible.
You got enough cream there, Dan?
All right. All right.
All right, then.
Stayin' outta your teeth.
Don't tell me. Don't tell me anything about boats, my friend... because I've spent my entire life on boats. Big boats! All boats!
All I've got is a boat.
Too damn many boats.
That's enough of that.
Just remember who you're talking to around here.
You know, dry on dry land... you're all right.
Goodbye, old friend!
And keep away from boats!
You know, me, my friend,
I know about boats.
I've been about boats all of my life.
I decide the discussion is terminated as far as I'm concerned.
Boats.
Smile.
- Mr. Dobbs?
- What is it, Jimmy? I'm busy.
I know. Only it's Sheriff Gillis and he says he needs to talk to you.
He says he needs to talk to me.
The truth is, he's in pursuit of an immodest amount of that weed... which you and your school chums seem to find so fascinating... and of which, it is rumored, you are the town's leading merchant.
Now send him in.
And fear not. I'll never tell him you keep it in the reposing room... under a stiff.
Yes, sir.
- Good afternoon, Sheriff.
- Dobbs.
I hope you don't object to my using you for light-hearted banter.
Don't think it was so light-hearted.
I did catch him with joints once.
Never let it be said I denied employment to an ex-convict.
No big deal. He wasn't dealing. Just a couple of joints. He's a good kid.
Dobbs.
Dobbs?
Forgive my preoccupation. She was more difficult than I anticipated.
Why should she be any trouble?
She died in her sleep.
Poor Mrs. Collins. She looked as though she'd been in a fistfight.
- So you put on a lot of makeup.
- A lot of makeup?
That would be appropriate for the final viewing of a streetwalker.
The deceased was, I believe, a retired music teacher.
- Congratulations.
- Oh, Officer. This is child's play.
I've replaced missing eyeballs with sawdust and glued the lids together.
I've used bent aluminum combs for dentures.
I've used the back part of the scalp when there was no front part.
And I folded one hand over wadded-up newspapers... when the other hand had no fingers.
You find all this obscene, Sheriff?
Do you know what's really obscene?
Look at this. Look at the work
I've done. This is an art... and I am the artist! What can you remember about a sealed box?
A sealed casket: that is obscene.
That is the death of memory.
The cosmetologist gives birth.
I make souvenirs.
All right, Jimmy! Move it!
And now, Sheriff, precisely what can I do for you?
I just wanted your professional opinion about a hunch I got.
- A hunch?
- It keeps going around in my head.
From what you saw at the crash site, is it possible... the guy we fished out of the wreck... could've been placed in the car to make it seem like an accident?
Frankly,
I have no real basis for...
Thank you.
- Dobbs Mortuary.
- Sheriff Gillis still there?
Just a moment, please.
It's for you, Sheriff.
- Yeah.
- Dan? Betty here.
- They found a body in the boatyard.
- What?
- You better get down there.
- Betty, I'll be right over.
Dobbs, meet me at the boatyard as soon as possible.
Well, Dan, this is certainly not an accident.
That's a murder. I bet I'm right about the guy in the hospital too.
- Morning, Ben.
- Dan! How you doin'?
All right. Have you recently had anybody check out without paying... or... just disappear?
No.
Now, wait a minute.
A guy checked in here yesterday.
Said he'd be here a couple of days.
He hasn't checked out, and I haven't seen him nor his car since.
But I noticed this morning his suitcase is still here.
What's his name?
I don't bother much with registrations anymore.
Well, we better check his things.
Oh, God. I hope nothing happened to him while he was checked in here.
It's a jinx. This sort of thing scares off your business.
Just kills the tourist trade.
I didn't know we had a tourist trade.
Don't rub it in.
I'm telling you, it's tough makin' it these days.
He's a photographer.
Lot of camera books. Not a damn thing with his name on it.
- For Christ's sakes!
- What?
Ask your wife.
- My wife?
- She knows him.
My wife?
What are you talking about?
Well, I just remembered.
Remembered what?
The maid, Edna Jo. She says...
What did she say, Ben?
She says... that your wife dropped over yesterday to see him.
That's right.
Of course.
Thanks, Ben. I'll talk to Janet about it tonight.
This is not important.
Hi, honey! A kiss.
- Uh-oh.
- What's "uh-oh"?
- Something's wrong.
- Nothing's wrong, Janet.
- You can talk to your wife.
- I'm just tired, that's all.
Come on. You know what you're like when you keep it inside of you.
Who's the guy you went to see at the hotel?
"Who's the guy you went to see at the hotel?"
I was warned against marrying a cop.
You can't keep anything a secret.
What secret?
I was joking, you crazy cop.
There's no secret.
He's George... What's-his-name.
He sells photographic equipment.
What?
Did Ben tell you that I'd been seen in a man's hotel room?
- Ben didn't mean anything by it.
- And why did he say it, then?
I think it's the guy we found at the car wreck.
The one who was all burnt.
- Is he a friend of yours, Janet?
- Not really. It's... it's just that it's the kind of thing you think happens to other people.
Not to somebody you know.
George. George LeMoyne was his name.
Excellent, at least we know his name. Do you know where he's from?
No, honey, I don't.
I just saw him at school.
I feel a little shaky.
Can I get a hug, Danny?
It's all right. It's all right.
Are you all right?
I'm okay.
- You know what's funny, though?
- No.
You were jealous.
A little bit.
Well, I guess I was.
- I love you, Dan.
- I love you, Janet.
- Mr. Haskell? Mr. Haskell?
- Why, hello, Dan.
- How are you, sir?
- Fine.
Maybe you could give me information about the guy in the hospital...
...George LeMoyne.
- Yes.
He sold photographic equipment to the school, but Janet couldn't...
What? What are you talking about?
- You did buy equipment from...
- No. Not only from him.
We didn't buy it at all.
Is it possible this is a transaction you didn't know about, sir?
I know everything that's done at the school. I am the principal.
- Yes, of course. Thank you.
- All right, Dan.
Mr. LeMoyne's signs are much more stable today, doctor.
Good. Let me see the chart.
It's time for his medication now, isn't it?
It is.
Well, I think I'll cut it down.
Just give him 5O cc's now.
- I'll be back within an hour.
- Yes, doctor.
- Doc?
- It's okay, Dan. Come on in.
They told me downstairs he pulled out of coma. How's he doing?
It's touch and go.
We might pull him through, but... even if we do, there's not much the best plastic surgeon can do.
You saw him. His entire face is one charred mass.
- And the right eye, I'm afraid...
- Any chance I could talk to him?
- Even...
- Briefly. Just for a moment.
Let's go outside.
Come on, let's sit down.
Well, when'll I be able to talk to him?
Look, Doc, I've got to find out what the hell really happened!
Sit down, Danny, sit down.
I'm sorry, Doc. This... this thing got me spooked.
- Look, has he said anything at all?
- No. Not a thing.
And I'll tell you, I'm afraid he's gonna be difficult to understand.
- Understand?
- Well, you see... he has no lips.
Hello, Freddie.
Hi. I'm so glad to see that you're feeling better.
You had a very close call, but you're gonna be all right.
Now just lie still.
I'm gonna give you something. It's gonna make you feel even better.
Daniel, Daniel, Daniel. You're a great disappointment to me.
A whole week. You're still unable to establish that man's identity.
- What's it to you, Dobbs?
- What's it to me? A sealed casket.
That's what you have me burying there. A sealed casket.
If you had been able to find that poor boy's family... they might've asked me to perform some of my magic.
You know, Dobbs, sometimes you make me sick.
Sick? You bring me a body that smells like burnt steak... you force me to keep it till it rots, and you have the nerve to tell me...
...that I make you sick?!
- Two murders, Dobbs!
Both strangers. Two murders in a town no bigger than a postage stamp.
Now you leave me the hell alone.
Dan? Honey, I'm home!
- Where have you been?
- Honey, I'm sorry I'm late.
I had a million errands. Paul
Haskell had another staff meeting.
And tonight is PTA.
Wanna come?
I know how much you enjoy it. Think how much fun you'll have with me.
- I'd rather not.
- Okay. But if you want dinner... you have a choice of fish sticks or beef stroganoff... and both come out of the package, but I'll pre-heat the oven for you.
Honey?
Dan? What happened?
You look so down.
It's nothing. Janet, I...
It's nothing. It's just those murders, you know?
My God, yeah, the murders.
That's horrible.
Listen, honey, I've gotta go.
Look what I forgot.
Would you please drop this off at Ernie's for me?
- Why? What is it?
- It's some film my students shot.
It's their new class project, a good way to teach them about narrative.
Hey. You don't mind, do you?
No, no, it's all right.
Honey... you'll catch the murderer.
I know you will.
- Okay. Listen, I'll be back early.
- Okay.
I'll go inside and ask for directions.
- Be right back.
- All right.
Ron?
- What?
- Don't forget to ask about the gas.
Right.
- Excuse me.
- Good evening. Can we help you?
- I hope so. I'm lost.
- You're in Potters Bluff.
- Where did you wanna be?
- The Sea view Lodge.
No, you're not lost. Just take the Highway 12 over there.
Thanks.
My, what a cute little boy.
- Jamie has to go to the bathroom.
- Come on, I'll show you where it is.
You want your Mommy and
Daddy to take you, right?
- Well, what is it that you want?
- Ice cream.
I'm sorry, we just don't happen to have any.
That's all right. We'll get you some ice cream later, okay, pal?
- Let's go.
- Ron, gas.
- Is there a gas station nearby?
- Freddie.
- Can you sell these folks some gas?
- Sure thing. It's down the street.
- Didn't mean to disturb your dinner.
- No problem. Happy to help you out.
- And thank you.
- You folks must be from the city.
- Not used to all this hospitality.
- Yeah, that's right.
- I can't see a thing in this stuff.
- Neither can I.
- You want some gum?
- Jesus!
- Why did you swerve like that?
- Somebody ran in front of the car.
Jamie, are you all right?
Here, son. Come on up with
Mommy and Daddy. That's a boy.
- There you are.
- Honey, are you all right?
- Let me see that.
- He hurt his head.
- Let me see, son.
- Look, there's a light.
- Where? I don't see any light.
- I saw a light, Ronny! I just...
- There's no light up there.
- I saw a light!
You're being silly. There's no light there. I don't see any light.
All right, I didn't see anybody run across the road.
Okay, honey. We'll have a look.
- Don't cry, you'll be fine.
- Come on, fella. There we go.
Maybe they have some ice to make a cold compress or something.
- All right.
- Or we can use the telephone.
- Sure.
- Jamie, are you all right, honey?
Boys bump their heads all the time. Right, son?
- His head hurts.
- Honey, maybe you're right.
- This place looks abandoned.
- Go ahead, knock.
Let's go back to the car.
Hello? Listen, we just had an accident out in the street and... if we could get some help...
- Anyone in there?
- No.
- The lights don't work.
- Maybe they're upstairs.
We need some help. Hello?
- There's nobody here!
- Is anybody here? I saw a light!
Try in there, then, for Christ's sake.
Is there anyone here?
Hello? Hello?
We have a son who's injured, and if you could help us or something...
No! I saw a light in this house.
Let's get ice or a compress.
Baby, come on, look at this place.
It's been abandoned for years.
- Let's go!
- I saw a light! I know I did!
- You thought you saw it.
- I didn't imagine it, Ron. I saw it!
- I wanna get out.
- I'm telling you I saw...
- Jamie, you okay?
- Didn't mean to scare you.
It's all right. Now let's get outta here, all right?
- It's the house.
- There is somebody here. No.
It's the house, let's go! There's nobody here, let's get outta here!
- I don't like it. It's not safe!
- They're fixing the fuses!
Fine, okay, fine.
Go with your mom, all right?
I'll find it, wherever that is, and show you there's nobody here. Stay.
- Okay, okay.
- Christ!
- Hurry up, okay?
- All right!
Anybody here?
Ron?
Ronnie?
Ronnie?
God!
Okay, come on, let's... let's look inside the refrigerator.
Let's see what's in here.
Here we go.
- Where's... Dad?
- Come on, sweetie.
There's not any ice in here for your head.
- What's the matter?
- You scared me, honey.
There's nobody in the basement.
Come on, let's get outta here.
Welcome to Potters Bluff.
- What's going on here?
- Give me the boy! Run!
- Ronnie!
- Come on, run!
- Get in!
- Where?!
Mommy! Mommy!
Jesus Christ, how many are there in here?!
God! Take Jamie! Hurry up!
In here!
Leave us alone!
- Honey, no, I can't!
- There's a balcony here, let's go!
You can make it!
Get out there! Here!
I'll carry Jamie. Honey, get going!
Hold on!
Honey, hurry up!
- Help me, help me!
- Come on!
Hang on!
Get in the car!
- Hurry!
- Give me here Jamie!
They're coming! They're coming!
Start the car!
They're coming! They're coming!
Start the car!
- Get out!
- Lock the door, lock the door!
- All right, get up there!
- My God, honey! Start the car!
Lock the door!
I got it!
They were trying to kill us, Ronnie!
Get off! Get off!
Get off!
Jesus!
Oh my God.
Stop!
- Janet?
- Yeah, honey?
- I had some shells here. Seen them?
- Shells? When were you at the beach?
Bullets, Janet, bullets.
"An ancient folklore has they can only be made from persons dying... violent deaths."
Janet!
What the hell are you doing with these?
It's for my class. I'm gonna give a lecture on witchcraft.
Witchcraft? And why in God's name would you wanna teach them that?
Kids love creepy things.
Keeps them from being bored in my class.
So you picked witchcraft.
I just thought of it.
I don't know why I'm defending myself. You grill me like a suspect.
Sorry, Janet. I've just been under a lot of pressure.
Speaking of the kids, Dan, did you drop the film off at Ernie's?
- I forgot.
- Those kids worked hard on that!
I'll take care of it, Janet.
By the way, I found your bullets.
They were in the cabinet... where you left them.
- Have a good day, ladies.
- Morning, Ernie.
- Dan.
- I want this film developed ASAP.
- Police business. When'll I have it?
- On Wednesday.
- It oughta be back by then, I hope.
- Okay. Ernie... nobody picks this up but me, understand?
Okay.
Nobody.
Yeah, yeah, the fisherman's on the County too, Dobbs.
- Poor man was just passing through.
- Say, Dan... you think you could get the County to pay me to reconstruct his face?
Don't get greedy, Dobbs. Just seal him in a box and bury him!
- What about that hunch I had?
- After careful consideration...
I've come to the conclusion you may be right.
It's very possible he was disfigured somewhere else... and then placed in the wrecked car to make it look like an accident.
- Why not do that with the fisherman?
- I'm not the detective.
You are.
And keep up the good work. Bye, bye.
"Good work".
- Danny? Harry here.
- Yeah, Harry?
I just pulled a late model Ford out of the water down by South Beach.
- Appears she come off the bluff.
- Off the...? Oh, no.
- Was there anybody in it?
- No. Just a kid's toy airplane.
I have to find out if any of these particles contain human skin.
I scraped it off a car that might've been involved in a hit-and-run.
Hit-and-run?
Sure, Dan,
I'll give the full workup.
- Can you get it over to me soon?
- Dan?! Dan!
- Come on in, Ben.
- Okay. See you later, then.
Yeah, Doc. I'll drop it off some time this afternoon. Thank you.
- Sit down, Ben. What's wrong?
- That guy.
The one you came to see me about last week...
...that died after the car wreck.
- Yeah?
I just saw him.
- Ben, what are you talking about?
- He's at the station, pumping gas!
- Ben, he's dead!
- You go over there and take a look!
I never got a look at him. Obviously it's a guy who looks just like him.
- It's the same guy!
- Ben, would you just...?
- I was standing next to that man...
- Calm down.
You ask your wife!
So, voodoo... is basically religion.
Belief and conversion are absolutely necessary for its practices to work.
- Hi, Sheriff Gillis.
- Good afternoon, girls.
But, despite what you might have seen on the late show... when you were watching what your parents told you not to... they do not... walk around...
Like this.
- Yes.
- You sure?
You scared us.
No!
You okay?
Although they are conventionally dead... they're capable of very closely imitating the living.
There are even reports, not substantiated but not discredited... of a tribe in central Peru... whose residents included a great number of these... walking dead... who were completely at the will of their master... and they roamed around the mountains killing strangers... and bringing them back to their master. Now... you wanna hear the really creepy part?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
In order for the master to retain control over his undead... he had to cut out their heart... and keep it... hidden.
Janet, how come Haskell didn't know about LeMoyne and the equipment?
Oh, so you're the big mouth!
The PTA was buying it as a surprise.
- I'm sorry.
- Well, you didn't know.
We don't need gas. I just filled it up this morning.
I realize that.
If I told you once...
This is a piece of machinery that takes a lot more than gas to run it.
- You gotta check the oil, water...
- I'm not a mechanic, I'm a teacher.
- What can I do you for, Sheriff?
- Freddie, would you check the hood?
Sure thing.
Listen, I'll check the oil, I'll check the water. Just give me a kiss.
Hey! You sure you wanna ride with me?
How do you know
I'm not a dirty old man?
They call me Chance.
How far are you goin'?
I'm goin' to Potters Bluff, but I have to stop at my place up the road.
Hey, you wanna come on up with me to Potters Bluff?
It's a real nice little town.
You ever been up there?
- Never heard of it before.
- Come on in outta the rain, honey.
There we go.
All right!
We won't get home until dawn.
- Now, where are you heading?
- No place in particular.
Well, then I'd think about staying a spell up there in Potters Bluff.
You know, I'd damn sure rather live in a nice little town like that... than in some big city full of killers and muggers, you know?
- Yeah.
- Well, there's my boat right there!
- You live on a boat?
- Hell, all my life.
Okay now, I'll just be a second, honey. I'm gonna pick somethin' up.
Excuse me, I wanna get something right out of this glove box here.
Smile.
What are you doing?!
Smile.
No, please!
So lovely.
So frail. So young.
How could anyone mar such loveliness?
My dear...
I will make you beautiful again.
Even more beautiful than before.
Another masterpiece, complete and beautiful.
Now you can sleep peacefully.
You couldn't've mixed that with another piece of evidence?
- No way.
- Well, I checked it three times... and it keeps coming out the same.
- That's impossible.
- Look, if you don't believe me... send it upstate somewhere, but I'm telling you... that these bits of flesh have been dead at least three or four months!
Why? When did you think this hit-and-run happen?
- It wasn't recent.
- Are you absolutely sure?
Of course I'm sure.
Oh, you're wrong, Doc,
I know you're wrong.
It can't be.
It can't be!
- Potters Bluff Sheriff's Office.
- Betty?
- Hi, Doc! How are you?
- Is Dan there?
- No, it's too early for him.
- Where is he? I gotta speak to him.
I don't know, but I can try and find him for you. I just know...
No, no, never mind.
I'll go find him myself.
Damn you, what're you doing?
What's going on?
Jill, what are you doing? That's acid! Don't do that! You're insane!
Stop that! No! No, no, let go! Don't do it!
What are you doing here, Dobbs?
- Dobbs, what are you doing here?
- Morning, Daniel.
- Dobbs, I don't have time...
- Don't get pushy and policeman-like.
- This is very embarrassing for me.
- What is?
Well... I'm here to report a theft.
- What, somebody steal a body?
- Yes.
- What?
- That pretty young waif you found.
- You mean somebody dug up her grave?
- Well, this morning...
I would've laid her to rest, but she was gone.
What the hell is going on in this town?!
What maniac is loose out there?
First murders, now body snatching!
My God, I can't believe it! Okay, come on, we'll go to your office.
No! We can't do that.
Why can't we?
We can't let anybody know.
My reputation.
Who would entrust a loved one to a mortician known to have lost a body?
Would you, Dan?
- This is ridiculous.
- Well, maybe I am panicking.
Maybe my young protegé slipped her into a drawer and forgot to tell me.
- I'll check. I'll talk to you later.
- I hope you find her.
With three murders and my wife,
I've got enough problems of my own.
- Yeah. Janet's been acting strange.
- You hardly know her.
She comes to visit me all the time.
Didn't you know that?
You wouldn't have anything to do with her sudden interest... in witchcraft and voodooism, would you?
Certainly not. And you can tell her
I was more than mildly insulted.
Just because I'm a mortician, she had the audacity to insinuate... that I might have knowledge of the black arts.
Dobbs, you don't believe the dead can come back, do you?
Back to life?
In my profession, that's a rather unpleasant thing to think about.
Come on. You're not gonna tell me you believe that missing corpse... just got up and walked away!
I don't know what to believe anymore.
Just a minute.
- Hello.
- Hi, Dan. I' m late.
Yes, Betty. I did notice you were late again.
- My car wouldn't start, lwaited...
- Okay, okay.
- I have to leave. Talk to you later.
- Betty, just... as soon as you can.
On your way over, stop at Ernie's and see if that film's ready.
- Dan, did you look at that telex?
- What telex?
- From St. Louis.
- St. Louis?
- It's about George LeMoyne.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- It's on your desk, Dan.
- It's on my desk.
"Close to positive ID on your so-called George LeMoyne.
Facilities here better equipped.
Request body be transported."
Dobbs?
Jimmy, what the hell are you doing?
Nothing. I gotta go now.
Dobbs!
Sam?
Sam!
Where's Dobbs?
I ain't seen him yet today.
Get your shovel, Sam, we're gonna have to dig him up.
Dig up? I don't dig them up.
I just bury them.
- This one you're gonna dig up.
- Not without Mr. Dobbs' permission.
You don't need his permission. I'll take responsibility. Get started!
Dobbs?
- Come on, Sam, I'll help you.
- I don't need no help.
Come on, I'll help you with it!
I gotta get this damn box open!
- Come on, now, open it!
- Are you crazy?
I don't wanna see no rotting corpse.
This box doesn't weigh enough to have a corpse in it. Now open it!
No. Mr. Dobbs sealed it.
Betty. Betty, get on the telex.
Come on, come on!
Okay, Dan.
Records Division, Police Department,
Providence, Rhode Island.
"Request immediate check on arrest records... and/or convictions of one G. William Dobbs... male, approximately
7O years of age, 6 feet... weight... 14O pounds.
Present occupation: funeral home owner.
Resident here since approximately spring 197O.
Uh, Betty. Betty?
When you finish, send this photo to the police in St. Louis.
I wanna know if he's their missing person.
- Anything else, boss?
- Yeah. Send the telex.
Wait a minute!
Ernie said the film was ready.
Thank you, Betty.
- Have you got that roll of film?
- Yeah. I got it right here.
That'll be 5 dollars and 40 cents.
Things keep goin' up.
Sorry it took so long.
- Sorry.
- Not another hit-and-run, I hope.
- You okay?
- But are you?
To tell you the truth,
I'm not so sure.
Police work's a high-stress occupation. Watch yourself.
- Doc, can I talk to you, please?
- I can't talk long.
- Just a minute. It's important.
- All right, Dan. What is it?
In your professional opinion... is there any way whatsoever to reanimate people after they die?
And to... to get them to walk around?
- You have been working too hard.
- I'm not joking.
My God, you're serious.
You remember what you said after examining that particle of skin...
...from the supposed hit-and-run?
- Sure. I said it'd been dead months.
It wasn't months. It was my car, my accident. Happened the night before.
- Couldn't be.
- I'm telling you it was.
Listen, maybe Norman was giving you a tune-up three months ago... and he scraped his arm on your grill!
Doc, corpses have been disappearing from their graves.
Well, if that's true, that's very distasteful... but they have not been restored to life. That's for sure.
Dan! Dan, the telex from Rhode Island!
- Where is it?
- Hold it. We're standing by.

My goodness.
Our Mr. Dobbs?
Where are you going?
Janet?
Janet!
Janet, you home? Janet!
Dobbs!
What did you do to her? Goddamit, what did you do to my wife?!
- Good evening, Constable.
- What did you do to my wife?
Janet. My crown jewel.
My very first. My seedling.
Where is she?!
Look at them, Daniel.
Look at my children!
- Oh my God.
- They had to be disfigured.
Don't you see? I have to make them look like they were. That's my art.
Where is my wife?
Janet, I found her in Harris Creek, in her car. She had drowned.
You're crazy.
You're totally insane!
Not even her injuries or her bloated condition could hide her beauty.
- My God, she can't be dead.
- Yes, she was. She is.
Like all the others, like that man you ran over with your car.
He was dead long before you hit him.
- How did you do it?
- Call it black magic.
Call it a medical breakthrough.
I'll take my secret to the grave.
Oh my God...
It's a nightmare! No!
I've always liked you, Daniel, so I gave her to you as a gift.
Most of the others, I gave back a little of their lives, but Janet...
I gave her fear and sex and love.
The others'd fall apart in a week if
I didn't touch them up, but Janet...
Janet could go three weeks, a month!
The others... drawings. Janet...
Janet was a painting.
My masterpiece.
Why are you doing all this?
Because when people are dead they don't get sick, they don't age... and after I work on them, they look so good, so healthy...
I can't bear to bury them! They're even more beautiful than the living!
You evil son of a bitch!
You will try to kill me,
Dan, but you can't.
You can only make me dead.
Go on, pull the trigger!
Help me become one of my own children!
Oh, Daniel. I enjoy these little chess games with you.
Perhaps you need a little more motivation.
Hello, baby. How was your day?
You wouldn't believe mine.
Paul Haskell had another locker check ten minutes before lunch.
- Janet!
...everybody standing in the hall... next to their lockers.
It was enough to drive me crazy.
- What would you like for dinner?
- I'll get you for what you've done.
The dead have no memory except what I give them.
She only appears alive.
- You are alive.
- She's dead, Dan.
She's dead.
You can have anything for dinner, if you don't mind fixing it yourself.
- But I'll fix it for you.
- She's dead.
...between minute steak...
- Baby, please, die, die!
She's dead.
- Also, you have pork chops...
- Die!
...or beef stroganoff, but I warn...
- Please!
...it's out of the package.
Dan, I'm dead.
Please bury me.
Please.
Dan... bury me!
Janet!
Janet!
Janet!
Bury me.
Please.
Please, Dan!
I love you, Dan.
May she rest in peace, Dan.
Ernie?
Betty.
Ben.
Dan, old buddy.
If you can't solve an accident, what'll you do if a crime happens?
Harry.
Freddie.
What can I do you for, Sheriff?
Midge!
Midge?
Jimmy.
I gotta go.
Police work's a high-stress occupation.
Doc?
...restored to life.
That's for sure.
- Be happy for her, Dan.
- Smile.
No!
Don't touch me! Get back!
Keep away from me!
God, no, please!
No! Don't touch me! No!
Don't let him get away!
There's one more thing you should know, Dan.
Come, Dan.
Let me fix those for you.
Come on, Cassey, another straight after hours.
You've been on your feet whole day!
No, thanks Joey.
I've got a day job too.
-Are you sure I can't give you a lift?
-I'd rather face the muggers.
Come on! Gimme your money! Sweetheart!
I worked whole for these tips, and I don't leave it.
Officer!
Officer!
Officer!
Officer!
Officer! Thank God its you!
Two puerto rican guys... just trying to mug me....
I swear to god!
It was a cop with a knife.
It was a cop, a big cop.
I hate the smell of these places.
Good morning.
So...
Well, We have a C-2...
C-3 fracture dislocation...
The head was unstable and there was a desolvation injury...
The residual hanging...
...where the head just "popped"
That's not what is interesting.
What's interesting is we also have a crushed larynx.
The head's just flopping.
You're tryin' to tell me two kids did this?
I just got a statement from an eyewitness said he saw the kids attack her.
Can't you cover her face?
Her name's
Cassey Philips
I used to go in her place for a nightcap.
She always have latest jokes, nice sense of humor.
I always told her she ought to...
... audition for one of those comedy joints.
All the more reason I was thinking was these bastards put away.
Don't pass out on me Lovejoy.
Take a look at the size... of those hematomas.
You think I don't want those two kids could have done that?
Shit, you really think that a cop did this?
Why not? She knew me, she knew a lot of cops.
What's the use?  Let's go.
I think I need some fresh air.
You must've been so afraid Cassey...
... And you saw a cop.
So we just about closed that club. .
You're not kidding.
Sam, wath the lights!
What's the matter with this thing?
Its quite broken or something.
Relax.
What's the hurry?
Oh, shit, its a cop. Ditch that beer.
- Where did he come from?
- I don't know, I don't know.
Alright, what seems to be the trouble, officer?
Oh no, I think he wants you to go with him!
What for?
I don't know. You just better cooperate, alright?
I can't stand any more tickets.
My insurance will go up.
Yeah.
Commissioner. Detective Lt.
Mc Crae is here to see you.
Send him in.
Have a seat, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant, I've been going over your report.
Seems you automatically assume , that it was a police officer, instead of some ... lunatic son of a bitch dressed up like a cop.
He didn't kill the girl.
He wanted a witness.
Oh, there you are.
Obviously, someone tried to discredit the police force.
I mean if its my profile for not to be a cop.
All the same I think, we have to take a look at around people.
I'd like to have police psychologist give a rundown on cops who've been under... mental disturbance, attempted suicide, under extreme emotional stress.
Sure, why don't we just test the whole damn force while you're at it?
Otherwise, We're looking for a white man well over six feet tall, wears a police uniform, doesn't have an alibi.
I don't know where to start to look, Commissioner!
Listen, I want you to keep this within the department. Keep it quiet.
As long as we can... but he will kill again, he enjoys killing.
You know Lieutenant, You seem to know a hell of a lot about this guy.
Tell me something, when was the last time you had a mental test?
Anytime, Commissioner.
As a matter of fact, didn't you try to shoot yourself a couple of years back?
The gun went off.
The gun went off.
Exactly, ten days after your partner was killed in the line of duty ... your gun just happens to ... discharge all by itself.
You've been even killed in every sense,
Even now,
You don't smile very much.
Hey! What you!
This is my car!
Help! please help!
Help!
Help me!
Help!
Please! Help me! Please!
This is not funny! Stop it!
Help me!
I'm so suprised when you called.
I didn't think we will see each other again.
I see you on the news, in the end of each night.
Just before I shut off the lights.
How romantic.
Gina, this is'nt about romance. about murder.
People have to be warned.
Most people, they respect the uniform.
They do anything the cop tells them,
Including take a walk up a dark alley.
Who is he killing?
Pushers? Hustlers?
Innocent people.
Jesus! Maniac cop?
How's that for a tag?
I knew I could count on you to sensationalizing the best way.
Now you got to make it bigger than AIDS.
Its the only way to city hall off their ass.
You're ready to go on the line on this?
Be quoted directly?
I'm ready to hand you an exclusive on this...
... But I want you break it on the late news show tonight.
Okay, I'll need a backup on every detail, names of witnesses, specifics from...
Find everything you need right there.
Mc Crea, remember ...
I owe you one.
You don't owe me anything.
This report was  informed by the source within the New York Police department...
... of attempts by the Homicide Division... to suppress facts regarding three recent homicides.
Facts and witnesses to these murders point unmistakably to a uniformed police officer.
I repeat, a uniformed New York cop has been seen in the commission... of these brutal killings occuring on the streets of the city after dark.
The question this station wants answered, why has Commissioner Pike withheld these facts, and does the Mayor know what is going on in his city?
How can the public defend themselves if they're unaware...
...that one of New York's finest may indeed be a psychopath... whose intent is to kill them rather than protect them?
Tomorrow on the morning show, we will have an interview with...
...Detective Lt. Frank Mc Crae McCrae who is in charge of the investigation. was ordered not to speak to the press.
You're not gonna get me!
Anybody who wants to shoot a cop these days has got a helluva excuse.
Can you believe that?
She thought he was the fucking the maniac.
Look. We've received 700 letters accusing individual police officers.
Look Councillor,
A cop gives you a parking ticket so what you do naturally...
...you write in a letter accusing him of being the killer. Right?
Shit! Why does that have to happen
4 weeks before of my retirement?
We're all in trouble, Captain.
Tourism's off by 38 percent.
This nut must be quite, he is costing the taxpayers bringings every day.
Ripley, If you can't handle this, put in for early retirement and step down.
No way, Councillor.
I want to nail this bastard.
Pretty sharp.
He'll be one step ahead of me.
If I stake out
Tribecca and Soho, he strikes the east side.
He may be getting information from inside the department.
That means he is one of us.
I didn't know you were on duty tonight.
Yeah, With all the flu going around, they had to put a lot of us on overtime.
Always at night.
It worries me when you work so much at night.
Worries me too.
You don't talk about it much.
When I come home, i wanna forget.
But it makes me feel left out, Jack.
You used to talk to me.
Look, You're the one who dropped out of the therapy.
I was willing to go. I was willing to pay the bills.
So it's all my fault now. Is it?
I did everything to hold this marriage together.
You talk like it's already over.
It's not enough to talk, you have to listen too.
I suppose that's why you've been taking all this overtime.
To get away from me.
- Or is it something else?
- What is that supposed to mean?
Sometimes you wake up...
... screaming, like you can't breath.
Sometimes i get afraid that you might hurt me in your sleep.
Have I ever hurt you?
I know it's wrong to be afraid of my own husband but I...
Now, why could't you say that to the therapist?
Why couldn't you simply say, I'm afraid of him and I don't know why.
Don't Jack, please!
Don't go out tonight.
Stay with me.
Now, how can I?
I'm on the duty roster.
I'll make it up to you on the weekend.
We'll go for ride in the country.
We gonna go up to Tarrytown...
Hey, Don't pull away from me.
I'm sorry.
I don't know what's happening to me. I...
...I don't like being alone till all hours
I hear things.
I think I hear things.
Look, There's enough locks on the doors, you've  got a gun and you know how to use it.
Let me fix that for you.
Look, If I get out early tonight,
I'll try not to wake you.
You can wake me up.
Maybe I'm sleeping too much. They say that could be depressing to a person.
You know too much sleep.
Be careful now.
You say that every night.
He went out again, didn't he?
Who is this?
Why do you keep calling me?
Why does Jack keep killing people?
He going to do it again tonight?
Why you keep doing this to me?
-Hey Jack?
-Hey Benny.
Its not a big deal. I'll fix it.
No, I'll fix it myself.
Why did follow me?
I thought ...
I was afraid you were...
God.
I didn't want you to find out this way.
I wanted to tell you but
I didn't know how.
Just...don't come near me.
You have every right to hate us both, but let me just try an explan....
I don't want to hear another word.
You say anymore...
... I'll be killing you both.
Ellen, don't point that thing.
- Just drop that thing.
- Let her go.
Let her go.
Oh, Jesus.
You folks checked out yet?
You must've partied up good in here.
Let's see what other damage done.
Forrest.
- Let's talk.
- Yeah, sure Captain.
So you decided where you settle down after your retire, you...
...still think about florida?
It's about your wife.
She called you and complain about our trouble.
I thought she'd be going to a lawyer or something like that.
So you two haven't been getting along.
Ripley.
Captain Ripley!
Captain, since when is my personal life any of your business?
Since your wife was found dead in a motel room.
In a sleazebag Motor Inn on Eleventh Avenue,
With her throat slit from ear to ear.
No. You gotta be wrong.
You want to see some pretty pictures?
She ran out, I thought she might back home.
You admit you were there?
I tried to stop her but she had a gun.
Patrolman Forrest, before you say anything else...
...I better read you your rights.
You saving your reviews?
Never saw these before.
What about this?
Your wife's diary.
She wrote ...
"I now believe my husband may be doing these murders."
Is that why she followed you?
-Is that why you shut her up?
-This is not true.
Have you got an alibi for last Wednesday night and the preceding Friday?
-I was home.
-Come on Forrest.
If you were home, your wife wouldn't have suspected you.
Alright, I was seeing somebody.
I'll talk to my client now, alone.
Councillor, We've read him his Mirandas...
...and he elected to make a statement.
That's inadmissible!
He did admit that he was in that motel room with presence of the victim.
And that's enough.
Now you two guys, outta here.
Must remove now, Councillor.
Councillor,
We intend to have this suspect, appear in a lineup for the witnesses, first thing tomorrow morning.
Good day Sir.
These guys are trying to make me the fall guy.
Everybody's screaming for blood I was and I'm it.
I'm certain you had no control over what happened.
Call it irresistible impulse.
That's a legal defense.
Better yet, bet you don't even remember committing the crimes,
Blackouts, Momentary lapses of memory.
What are you talking about?
I'm not crazy. I didn't do it.
You were seeing a therapist on a regular basis.
Come on, a marriage counselor.
I've got a witness. Okay,
Somebody else who was there.
I don't want to bring her into this unless there's no other way.
Pal! You need all the help you can get.
Its gonna ruin her career.
Let's give it till the end of the week.
If they don't find the real killer by then,
I'll name her.
Yeah, so I told my kids,
You see a cop, you cross to the other side of the street. I see a cop, I'm outta here. a policeman crossed the street to the other side.
I seen there my friends murdered by cops.
Shot in the back. Shot when they didn't have a gun or knife.
You know, cops like killing, that's why they're cops.
Who's gonna be next, huh?
Cops want you to be scared of them.
That makes them men, real men.
Because without that uniform what are they? I don't scare.
They respected cops in my day or they hit you on your head with their billy.
They didn't take no guff.
They were the law.
Nowadays like this, they got to shoot you to get respect.
Nobody gives no crap to the cops, no more since this crazy cop come along.
You see a cop coming now, you get out of the way!
And there ain't much crime no more.
Hey, Listen...
But 18 years back I had a case for ya,
This guy made it look as if a psychopath was at work.
So what does he do then?
He goes in, He kills his wife and it looks like its one of the serial killings.
Jack, but set up to take the heat off the real psycho.
You gonna tell me you think that he's that smart.
He's a cop. Maybe even a Detective.
-Fuck you!
-Come on Ripley, why not?
Every Detective keeps his own uniform hanging in the closets and thats the one thing you never could get rid off.
Let me tell you if....
If Jack had an alibi, he would have come across with it by know.
Jack is protecting someone.
Whoever it is, he doesn't want to be get involved. and the killer knows who it is.
And you're a cop.
-Fuckin I'm a cop.
What the fuck are you?
Fuck you.
-You put you in danger
-How?
The scum wants to lay low for a while, till he starts another killing spree.
He likes us to relax our guard.
And he accomplishes that he hands us a prime suspect.
Why would he pick me?
Your size, your description, your personal file.
He's getting his information from inside the department.
-And, of course, your sex life.
-John, but nobody knew about that.
Your girlfriend might've told somebody, Jack.
She's the only one that can give us the connection and that puts her in danger.
John, She can take care herself.
She outshoots me every time we go to the range.
She's on the force?
You know her.
Theresa Mallory.
Congratulations!
Its a well kept secret.
Not well enough according to you.
Where do I find?
She is on duty tonight.
How're you doing beautiful?
Well, it depends.
Would you like a lift someplace?
Oh, I'm pretty much at roam right here.
Could I interest you in something else?
Want to be a little more specific?
You wouldn't be a cop?
You got it, mister. You asked the jackpot question.
Now, why don't you run along home to your wife and kids, like a good little boy?
Yeah, that's just what I was gonna do.
But I'll be thinking of you, baby.
Can't arrest you for that.
Ciao, baby.
Who is it?
Are you Malone?
Hey McCrae.
Don't get the wrong idea.
I'm on duty here.
Officer Mallory, 33rd Precinct.
Vice Squad
It couldn't have just been a bullet proof vest.
I hit him in the head atleast twice.
Just bring me a tab, will you?
-Okay
-Thanks.
Look at the marks on your throat.
I'm telling you Frank, his hands were so big... they felt like ice, even through his gloves.
He wasn't breathing.
Well, we won't put that in our report. Huh?
Why did you come looking for me?
You were Jack's only witness.
You had to disappear.
He...
He speak to you, say anything?
No, no not a sound.
Last call, want anything else?
Yeah, one more round. Doubles.
You're trying to get me drunk.
No, I'm just gonna stash you away some place for few days for safekeeping.
Why can't I go home?
Oh come on, If he knew where you were assigned to work it's sure he almost know where you live.
How could he?
You must have told somebody at work.
By a relationship?
Come on, Jack was delibrately set up.
Somebody found his wife to follow him.
Now, who did you tell?
I guess you know Sally Noland?
Should I?
Sure, She's been on the force for 20 years.
She's like a den mother to all of us.
You know, she wears that leg brace.
-Oh yeah, she uses a cane. Sure.
-Yeah that's her.
Her father was a cop.
I know, she's fixtures down headquarters.
She's been there so long, you hardly notice her.
What is this?
The key to my apartment, 4E.
I want you to lock yourself in there.
I'll call before I come back, So you know its me.
I'll ring twice, hang up, ring once again.
Don't answer the phone for anybody else.
Wait, I thought you were going to keep me company.
I'll phone for a cab. I don't want to get out to streets.
I will stop down at headquarters.
I have a feeling, Miss Noland will be haunting the joint.
Mc Crae, What did you do in your hands?
I cut myself shaving.
Sign me in. Will you?
Yes, Right.
You came in a very bad time.
The computer is down.
How do we ever please this town without a computer, huh?
The requested information...
... You have to out this form and
I'll process it in the morning.
You...
...You have a pen?
Thanks.
We have a hard time writing this, got little stitches in my...
You know, we really should know each other, were passing each other in the halls for years.
-Do have one friend in common.
-Who is that?
Officer Mallory.
Teresa.
She had a close call this evening.
Why? What happened?
She was working under cover vice.
Ran into a psycho,
Its a mess.
How is she?
She is okay.
Thank Jesus for that.
She is a fine girl, that one.
I knew you'd be relieved if she is okay.
Yeah, we should...
We should all have us a beer together sometime. Got to know each other.
Sure. We'll all be inseperable
How is that form?
I'll tell you the truth, its not very important. Forget it.
Better get that computer fixed.
I'm glad we finally got say hello.
Don't do this, please.
I know it would be safe if you put the girl away but this way is even better.
Now they think they got the guilty man so that way...
...they gonna let you guard down and you'll be free to get to the mayor and the commissioner...
...and put an end to this.
I knew you had that anger in you, Matt but...
But I thought it would be the dealers and the junkies and the human garbage that you'd be cleaning the city of.
Not all them poor people just minding their business.
What is it that got into you, Matt?
What's changed yourself?
I said I'd stick by you and I will.
But you gotta stop these killings.
Just only save it for those who did wrong to you.
Who's out there?
Answer me!
Oh, guess i was just jumping.
Matt?
Matt, where are you?
I need you, Matt.
You need me.
Come back ...
Hey you?
Oh, take it easy,
What you are doing?
I had to take a leak.
You always take a leak with a gun in your hand?
Its a good way to blow your balls off!
Oh.
You scared me.
You're wearing a uniform.
Yeah now everyones packing a gun and I don't blame you should get hazard pay with this uniform.
Yeah.
You got yourself killed back there those timbers are ready to freak.
This place is going to be demolished in a couple of weeks.
Yeah, the whole city'is going to hell, you can't take a pee anywhere anymore.
Here, more about Cordell than you've time to read.
He was my hero.
Yes, Matt believed in an old saying:
Shoot first and ask questions later.
He was kind though. Gentle enough if you got to know him.
Did you?
I hate to admit it, but he used to like come in here and look in his clippings, just like you're doing.
He gotta like being a celebrity.
Real shame about what happened to him.
It was a crime what the politicians did to him.
Put him in Sing Sing with with all those criminals he's been chasing all those years.
It was like handing him a death sentence.
They say he violated people's rights.
You see even killers got rights, huh?
They murdered him, those bastards at City Hall!
He had no kids, no wife.
I guess a one hundred percent cop like him give no time for a personal life.
Here Clance thanks, you may put this away.
You're wrong about that,
He had himself a real nice girl.
I think he wanna go married if they hadn't been for all that trouble.
-You're sure he was?
-Sure.
He brought her in one time to show off for her.
She wasn't much to look at, but nice.
And, of course a cop.
She must have taken it pretty hard.
Worse than that.
Right after he was convicted, the poor soul threw herself out of a window trying to kill herself.
Terrible thing for a
Catholic girl to do.
She crippled herself.
Thanks Clance.
Yeah, they don't make cops like him anymore.
He was one of the kind.
-He is still is.
-What was that?
Nothing. Forget it.
Oh, we're interrogating the suspect for about half an hour.
Okay, Call me when you feel.
We know who the killer is.
-Did you tell the D.A?
-Yes, we tried you but he wouldn't believe us.
You won't either.
You ever hear about Detective Matt Cordell?
Yes, before my time but you know, he's a legend.
Really trigger happy right?
He died in jail.
I suppose he didn't.
Suppose he's back.
Only now he kills innocent people.
But how can he get out of prison alive?
We're gonna find out, tommorow morning I've got an appointment with chief medical examiner of sing sing, Doctor Gruber.
Now why don't...
...why you continue this questioning for a while alone?
Rough him up a little bit.
Thanks.
Officer Mallory will continue the interrogation till I get back.
Right.
He knows, He knows.
He knows. He knows you're here.
He knows that
I'm no good to him anymore!
He knows, He knows, He knows.
He knows.
He knows...
He is here!
He is here!
Stop it!
Lean on me. Come on, walk this way, come on.
I'm not afraid. But to have him kill me when I still love him so much.
Why doesn't anybody answer?
Put her down, Cordell!
Put her down!
Son of a bitch!
No, no, no, stay there.
Hey, what's the matter with you?
Didn't you hear the buzzer?
What, you deaf?
What are you doing?
I've got to get you out of this building.
Come on.
What about you? If they see you with that gun, you gonna get shot.
Don't worry about me.
We gotta to find Mc Crae.
How did you get here?
With Mc Crae.
His car is still outside.
Okay, here is the deal. Get in and wait.
If we're not out in five minutes, hot wire it, haul ass out of here.
You got it?
-Got it.
-Okay go!
Keep your hands where
I can see them. Back up against the wall.
Hold on, I didn't do any of this.
You broke out of your cell.
You killed them all.
Wasn't me.
Was somebody else.
Shut up!
He's still here.
You're letting him get away.
Nobody's getting away.
I'm calling for backups.
-Don't even try.
-Ok, ok!
Listen!
-I didn't do any of this.
-Sure you didn't.
Put your guns over there.
Alright, on your face!
Both you!
-We may've gone after him.
-You heard him, he didn't do it.
Teresa, let's go.
Keeping McCrae's appointment in sing sing.
Sure, walk into a prison what happens, police force are out looking for you.
-You're a brave man.
-No, not brave, scared shitless.
Unless we can prove that in Cordell is still alive, its gonna be my ass.
Step over there, please.
Your left.
Yes, Can I help you?
Yeah, we better here in meeting with your
Doctor Grubber, We're a little early.
You got a name?
Mc Crae, Detective Frank Mc Crae.
Yeah, The Doctors office' around back to your left.
-Alright, thank you.
-You're welcome.
You know Matt Cordell?
Not many like that.
I did the autopsy on him.
Look, the authorities knew this something like that could happen to him.
Why didn't they prevent him?
He wouldn't allow it.
He refused to be in isolation.
Guess he...
...don't want admit that he was afraid.
What do you do in a case like that?
What do you mean?
When they're all cut up like that?
This is no ordinary morticians home.
We're not into a cosmetic approaches here.
When a prisoner dies, it's not our job, to make him look good again for his family.
We just stitch up the parts. and put them into a wooden box, and we bury him.
Is that what happened to
Matt Cordell?
I've look in my records.
Would you mind?
Most of them just go to the potter's field.
These are those records.
-His body was claimed by a woman.
-May I see that?
We both know Miss Noland.
I think before this goes any further,
I'd like to see some identification
Detective Mc Crae, something with your photograph on it?
Det. Lieutenant Mc Crae died early this morning.
He was murdered.
Murdered by the same man that killed over half a dozen people at police headquarters last night.
I haven't gotten to my morning paper.
No wonder you know all the lurid details.
If I had murdered a bunch of officers, the last place I'd come is the penitentiary.
Don't bullshit us.
You know who did the killings.
How could I know?
Cordell, wasn't dead.
And then you saved him.
Answer me.
Look, he was a fine Detective.
He had a lot of friends.
Everyone knew...
...that if we put him back in the prison community, they just attack him again.
There was no way he could survive.
So, when they brought him up here, more dead than alive, this policewoman convinced me to do the decent thing.
Like remove him from prison mortuary alive?
He wasn't exactly alive,
There was severe brain damage.
I'm certain he was legally dead.
I was telling the truth when
I signed that death certificate.
There's no way he could function as a human being again.
Read the newspaper, Doc.
Get out of my office, Now!
You never came here.
I'm not going to pick up that phone.
This never happened.
There's no end to your decency,
Is there Doctor?
What did I do wrong?
You should have seen him on the operating table, cut to pieces.
I know the system screwed him.
The politicians, put him in prison and the inmates did the rest.
And now you're trying to ruin my life and my career.
We're not trying to ruin anybody.
We just want to bury Mat Cordell once and for all.
Get out of here.
Go away.
Here Doctor, put this on.
What are you talking about?
You know it's
St. Patrick's Day?
Hey, The Mayor and the Police
Commissioner will be there.
Yeah, along with five thousand cops.
I bet Cordell has loved walking in that parade every year he was on the force.
Whatever he loved he hates now.
And so this years St Patrick's Day parade continues on schedule, despite speculation of the parade may have been cancelled due to fear of violence.
Authorities report scores of death threats against the police, plus threats of bombings along the parade route.
But this has not deterred a record crowd for turning out for New York's
St Patrick's Day parade.
What a parade it is.
Public have rage on the continued killings by the so called maniac cop, have brought many hostile New Yorkers to New Yorks 5th avenue today.
Police security forces and the special bomb squads are on full force.
As well as plaincloth detectives were mixed into the crowd.
I can't walk in. They're gonna shoot me on sight.
I'll do it.
Alright, but you gonna get through to the commissioner.
I'm supposed to convince him these killings are being committed by a dead man?
Commissioner pike was Chief of Police when Cordell was sent to jail.
He's probably the one that
Cordell blames more than anybody else.
-Where you gonna be?
-I'm gonna be right here.
So he says, Commissioner said that this is my wife.
Look who's just walked in.
Jack Forrest's girlfriend.
Come on, everybody outta here.
Alright, so where is that son of a bitch?
He's willing to give himself up.
After you listen.
So you're giving orders now.
I know who committed these murders.
So do we sweetheart, its your boyfriend.
You are wrong.
Its a man named Matt Cordell.
A ghost.
Did you come up with this lunatic idea up by yourself, or are you on drugs?
It was Mc Crae's theory.
But we verified it.
Listen sweetheart, last night before Mc Crae was murdered, he called my house,
I wasn't there
I was at a charity event but he was kind enough...
...to leave a message on my service.
Would you like to give a listen?
This is Frank McCrae.
I've got solid evidence this, homicidal maniac is getting information from inside the department.
His accomplice is a female employee.
A policewoman.
I'll be at the Crime Records
Division, waiting.
Call me when you get in.
Ofcourse he couldn't have been talking about you.
A policewoman,
The killer's accomplice...
He's talking about Sally Noland.
That's really great.
You accuse a dead woman,
When the fact is, the log states that you came to see
Jack Forrest last night on alleged police business.
And that you aided in his escape from that cell block.
-You helped him kill all those people.
-That's a lie.
Why are you doing this? You know
I'm telling the truth about Cordell.
Enough for the shit,
I've got a parade to attend.
Thats alright.
You better go sir, you know everyone else is left for the review extend.
No Wait, You may be in danger if you go down there.
Don't you understand? Cordell wants to kill you and the Mayor.
That's what Forrest told you to say?
If you have any sense at all, you won't go down there.
Book her! Asses for the first degree murder.
Nice to hear Commissioner avoiding reporters.
-Sit down there.
-What?
Right here.
I understand that you were going to book me.
Well, what's the rush? I mean, We got the commissioner's office all to ourselves.
We got a place in Newberg, you know me and your lady...
Not before you.
Commissioner, the tie!
Never mind the tie, come on.
-Oh, we've to wait?.
-Hardly...
Won't you put a a real feather in my cap and lay it all out for me.
The reason behind those killings...
...was extortion money, wasn't it?
Money had nothing to do with those killings.
It was an act of vengeance against the city.
You know the truth is darling,
I could really use a collar like this one.
Come on, win me the big promotion.
Make me a hero.
If you gonna put me under arrest,
I wanna see my lawyer.
You know, you got a real rotten ass attitude.
Fine let's go.
I'll take you downstairs.
Dont give me any trouble, huh?
This is great,
I don't believe this.
Everybody else has gone to parade and I'm stuck here with you.
This is fantastic.
You with your great attitude, ruin makes things nice. You know...
Is that Forrest?
Let's get him!
Hold right there!
No.
Listen to me,
He's up there!
He is in Pike's office.
Don't you go giving any orders! I ought to put a bullet right between your eyes.
...and I'll be a hero!
I'm the wrong guy!
He's out there...
Tell "His Honor" that this
"Maniac Cop" has been recaptured.
Hurry up! You're wasting time.
The killer's in that paddy wagon!
Come on, let's go!
Do you know how to handle a shotgun?
You just get close enough and watch me.
Vehicle last seen heading towards the river.
The river? I think I know where he's going.
Yeah sure.
Now listen to me.
Do you know where Pier 14 is?
Those piers are all closed.
They're collapsing.
McCrae once tracked him to Pier 14.
Hurry up!
Hold on a sec!
I'll call for backup.
This car 4604 requesting a backup in pier 14. Right away!
Let him go, Cordell!
Theresa, get these cuffs off.
Hold it there!
Easy on the bottles, Jerry.
You don't have to go.
Yeah, I got to, uh...
I got to see a sick friend.
He is, he's sick.
Well, it wasn't that good anyway.
Remind me not to get on your bad side.
I was supposed to pick up some medicine for him.
I don't suppose you could, um...
Nah, I don't suppose.
Bone.
Buy some vitamin E.
Okay.
You're not interested in the boat, are you?
No.
I don't think I can convince my husband.
Okay.
Well... it's been better for me, too.
Green Healy.
Yeah, my engine's had it.
Gotta get it fixed.
Sorry, fella, there goes your tip.
Shit!
Hey!
Son of a bitch!
Jesus Christ!
Fuck you, too!
I owe you a drink.
That's true, you do.
Ahoy, maties! Ishmael returneth, huh?
Hey!
How goes your search for that fiendish leviathan of the deep, Moby Dick?
Oh, Moby Dick?
- Isn't that a social...
- Isn't that a social disease?
Oh, God, it's only 1:30, Alex.
Yeah, and already into the B material,
I admit it, Rich, but, great art...
Great art demands a great audience, you know what I mean?
Permit me to introduce to you
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern here.
Emissaries from the Danish court, tree surgeons to the king.
They prune Danish, right?
Yeah, right, that's my line, Rich.
Yeah, and this...
This is of course, uh, Karl Marx.
Karl Marx, former lead guitar with the Boston Symphony Orchestra.
- Karl.
- And last, but certainly least, is Rastus, the court nigger.
What?
Do I detect some tension?
Oh.
Come now, gentlemen.
It's a simple matter of semantics.
What are we white, well-intentioned liberals supposed to call you cats these days, huh?
Blacks?
Coloreds?
Negroes? Darkies?
Jeez, you know, I don't know.
What would you call 'em, Rich?
I'd call 'em, "Sir," if I were you.
That's funny, you know,
'cause that's not what you called them the night your car was stolen.
Just what was it that you called 'em that night?
Alex.
Alex? Alex.
I wouldn't put up with that if I were you guys.
You must be... You must be crazy, Rich, calling them something like that.
The war, you know.
I can understand that.
I wasn't in any war.
See?
Uh, but if he convinces you he isn't crazy, don't send me the pieces?
Man, what are you doing?
Alex. Thank you, man.
Hey, friends, don't miss this, you're watching a pro in action.
Richard Bone, doing what he does best, walking away.
Where you going with my
God damn keys, huh? You fuck!
That's going on your tab, Cutter.
You look beautiful.
Considering.
I didn't say that.
It's a given. The way of the world.
Things are okay, considering.
Mmm-hmm. That good, huh?
Better.
Any minute now Prince Charming will, uh, ride by on his grand white charger and take me in his arms and carry me away.
My charger's got a bad battery, but will I do?
Hell, no.
Speaking of which, you're home awfully early, aren't you?
Couldn't you find a matron with a taste for gutter squalor?
Or, uh, is that the battery trouble you were complaining of?
I don't like you when you're stoned.
Hey, Rich, I don't like you when I'm straight.
How would you know?
You did have a bad night, didn't you?
Not until now.
Is it so bad, Rich, having a place to come home to, when you've got no place to go?
Poor Richard.
The bottle.
Golden boy.
Never say no to Richard.
Really must be tough playing second fiddle to a one-eyed cripple.
Hey, he's not your average one-eyed cripple.
Is that why you put up with his bullshit, sitting around waiting for the resurrection?
It's not gonna to happen.
How would you know?
You never stay in one place long enough to find out.
What does that mean?
Does that mean that if I'd been around at the right time?
I would have married Alex, anyway.
Hmm.
I don't think so.
Whatever you say.
But I did.
And you know what?
I'm real happy with the way things are.
Kenny!
Kenny!
Kenny.
One, two, three!
All right, Georgie.
What'd I do with my cane?
Okay, okay, now follow me, okay.
I'm all right, I'm all right.
- I'm all right.
- I know.
Okay, I know the way, there's 13 steps.
Okay, we bring this thing here, okay.
Steps right here.
One, two, three... Whoa, easy.
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Be quiet. Quiet! Shut up!
Don't wake Mo up.
Hey, Maureen, are you awake?
It's George!
Oh, well, look who's here.
Hi, Richie, can you give me a hand here?
Hey, you ain't got no clothes on, boy.
Be quiet.
Ah, shit, it's always good to have a little
Bone around the home, you know.
- Is it safe yet?
- Yeah, it's dark.
Jesus Christ, Bone, you really know how to hurt a guy.
I had a good teacher, Alex.
Yeah, gimme that bottle, George.
- Mmm-mmm.
- Gimme the God damn bottle!
Hi, Mo.
- Oh!
- Hi, George.
Lawsy, lawsy lawsy, lawsy.
I must've died and gone to heaven, huh?
You all right?
Yeah, he's fine, Mo.
- Sorry.
- No, don't be silly.
Don't let him fool you, he's bucking for sainthood.
Without me, he hasn't got a prayer.
Would you like some coffee?
No, no thanks, I'd better get home.
Susie's probably worried.
Yeah.
Must've known you were bringing him home.
No, completely by accident.
Hey, Richie, how did we do with that woman?
She seemed pretty damn interested in the 40-footer this afternoon.
I think she has something a lot smaller in mind, George.
Too bad. Here you go.
Ah. Gimme that bottle.
- Yeah, take care of my boy, Alex.
- Gimme that God damn...
I'll see you all at the parade.
Gimme the bottle!
What'll it be, Alex, coffee or sleep?
Any other choices?
Hey, where're you going?
I'm gonna finish sleeping on the boat.
Ah, come on, Bone.
He wants to, Alex.
He doesn't want to go, do you?
Yeah, it's getting late. I'm gonna hit it.
No, it's not late. It's early.
Hey. Come on.
Come on, stick around.
Mo doesn't want you to go, do you?
You're just being cranky, right?
Hey, come on. We'll do something together.
Have breakfast, a cup of coffee.
Good idea, huh?
Unless you've got something else in mind, right? Yeah?
You wanna watch?
Nah. You want me to watch.
Oh! Eee...
You guys are a little grim.
It's just a little joke.
Oh! Oh, I get it.
You don't want me to watch.
Okay.
You guys are making me very nervous.
If I didn't know better.
- Yeah?
- Is there a Richard Bone here?
That's me.
Do you own a green Healy convertible?
Why don't you just come in, Officers?
Yes, I do, why?
Oh, God.
Okay, Mr. Bone, let's do it again.
Let's take a look at the autopsy report.
Crushed trachea, fractured skull.
Semen in her throat, on her face.
Seventeen years old, cheerleader.
It's ugly, Mr. Bone.
Down in LA it happens all the time, but we don't get the creeps up here.
And you...
You didn't see anything.
That's right, and I didn't do it.
So I think I'm gonna go, all right?
Sit down.
Look.
I didn't see the face. Right?
I only saw the body.
What I saw of the body was a dark shape with sunglasses on, and I can't identify a face for you!
Send in Miss Duran.
Who's that, her mother?
Her sister. Tell her what you saw.
Shit.
That's your job.
It's your story.
Miss Duran, Mr. Bone.
I'm sorry.
Hey, what's your name?
Hey, Rich, Rich, Rich, Rich, you made the big time, have a drink.
Look, show him.
Well, look at that.
"Suspect held in slaying."
'Course, you know, a witness is not nearly as exciting as a murderer, but, uh, I'm willing to let bygones be bygones.
What'd you see?
I've been playing this game for six hours.
Come on, it's me, your old buddy, Alex.
What'd you see, man? Come on!
I didn't see anything, all right?
You saw a silhouette, we heard that much outside.
That's what I saw exactly.
What'd he look like?
What'd the guy look like?
I wanna go home, I'm tired, let's get out of here.
Home? What home?
Let's go look at some naked dancing ladies.
This is a group from Santa Barbara.
Hey.
See? See, Rich, just what I told you.
Take your mind off your trying ordeal.
You mean you?
Yeah, come on, watch the parade.
Look, our glorious past, the Mission of Santa Barbara.
Happy padres, happy Indians.
The blessings of the white man.
Wiped out in less than two 200 years by disease and forced labor.
You can still get one to clean up your kitchen or you know, park your car.
They died with Christ's blessing.
Happy corpses, each and every one.
You're right, Alex.
I need something fun like this.
Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.
Hey, the baton brigade, hey!
Jesus Christ, look at that one.
My God, they're maturing early.
Holy shit, man. We were born too soon.
You know what they do with those hard, smooth, polished, chrome batons these days.
I'll bet you do.
Hey, we gotta find someone for Mo.
Hey, Mo, you could go out with this guy.
Look at that one, Rich.
You could go for that, huh?
Or that one, or that one, or that one.
That one ain't bad.
You could probably boff all of them.
Hey. Look at the silver in that horse's mouth, huh?
You think we could mug a horse?
You think we could mug a palomino?
Hey! Arrest me!
Lock me up!
Hey, kid.
Gross!
Now we're getting down to it. Hard core.
Background, breeding, genealogy, sociology.
Rich, rich, rich! Rich.
For an honest-to-God dynasty you need family.
What do you say, Mo?
That's him!
What?
That looks like the guy
I saw at the trashcan.
And the honorary presidente of the parade, James J. Cord.
Who? That guy?
No, this guy right here.
- That guy?
- This guy.
That's the guy you saw at the trashcan?
Come here! Come here!
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me very much.
Excuse me a great deal, I'm very sorry but excuse me, get out of my way.
Come on! Excuse me. Excuse me, excuse me.
Rich, come here!
You mean him? You mean him?
That's J.J. Cord!
Hey, Alex! Richie! How do I look?
Hey you look like a fat man on a horse, Georgie.
Huh?
Cord was busy last night.
What do you mean, "Cord was busy?"
His car was burned at the marina.
What was he doing at the marina?
Paper says he was at the oil conference at the El Encanto.
Decided to go for a drive, he says he does it all the time.
- That's where I saw him.
- What?
I saw him at the El Encanto.
I was there last night.
I saw him at the parade and then I made the connection.
Pretty good. Well, we cleared that up.
What time did you say you left the El Encanto?
- Come on...
- I've been doing this all night long with professionals, Alex.
All right, I'm sorry, I apologize.
Talk about your leg or something.
Get your hands out of the guacamole, too.
Can I ask one more question before we talk about my leg?
What time did you leave the El Encanto?
No kidding.
That's funny because it says in the paper this guy was driving around around midnight, went down to the yacht club or something to look at his boat and kaplooie, somebody just happened to blow up his car.
What size car did you say you saw?
Wait a minute. Didn't say anything about blowing the car up.
The car was burned.
This is the fiesta, you know.
There's bars trashed all the time, cars are blown up all the time.
Girls get killed all the time.
What kind of car did you say you saw?
Big car.
Like a Cadillac, maybe?
I don't know.
Okay, I'm sorry, man.
You know you're right as rain as usual.
The odds against old J.J. Cord being a trashcan killer are absolutely out of the question, except for one thing, Rich, two things in fact.
First of all you said it's him.
Now, did I get that quote right?
Not similar, sort of, kind of looks like him a little bit. You said it's him.
And second, big number two, Rich.
His car takes it in the shorts within 90 minutes of when the girl's body is found.
Now you don't find that even remotely intriguing?
You know, you've got one big problem.
What's that?
Your imagination.
Just facts, Rich.
I mean, I haven't even begun to let my imagination loose on this one.
He's drunk.
Look out!
What makes you say that?
Yeah. Yeah! Yeah!
Motherfucker!
I'm gonna have to give that another try.
You fucking maniac!
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
It was, uh... It was an honest mistake.
I didn't even see the goddamn thing.
And besides, it was in my driveway.
You lying bastard.
You crazy, crippled, son of a bitch!
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't hit that with me. Come on.
Why don't you go...
Come on in the house...
Come on in the house, and have a drink and we'll talk it over, okay, huh?
Hey, you know, my old lady, she's got a vibrator your ass'd love.
Hey, Bone! Bone!
Watch it!
- Come on, let's go inside.
- Let's be neighborly.
He's crazy.
Come on, let's just call the police.
Now look what you did.
You woke up the dog.
What the hell are you doing, Alex?
Minding my own business.
Doing a little research.
Oh, and I conducted a modest sociological experiment.
Picked up several hitchhikers.
Yeah. An Afro-American homosexual and two mestizas with a domesticated simian.
Black cat and the two mez chicks weren't bad, but don't ever orgy with a pet monkey.
The little fuckers bite.
You know your insurance has lapsed.
That would be his problem.
Your license has expired.
Car runs fine without one.
...backs it right up where you see it now.
Backs up again, pulls the car...
That's him.
Evening, Officer, Officer.
My name is Alexander Cutter. I'm, uh...
This is my car and I'm real sorry about what happened, sir.
Just what did happen, Mr. Cutter?
He didn't tell you? Well, I'm still a little shaky about it, but what happened was, see, as I was coming up the street here in my car, another car flashed by me with his brights on.
I was turning into my driveway, now, you see, I know my driveway by heart,
I kind of have to, and just whammo.
- Can I see your license?
- Yes, sir.
What about some language?
Language?
Language, what language?
Jesus.
I simply invited the man to come in and to call you.
I mean, to calm down, really.
He seemed pretty upset.
You know this license expired?
Never rains but it pours.
Uh, I didn't know that, no, sir, you'll have to cite me for that.
You have to do your duty.
And duty's something
I know a little bit about.
I've cited you for a license violation.
You two can straighten it out with the insurance.
- Thank you, Officer.
- Are you kidding me?
This bastard's a goddamn crazy menace.
He's a fucking loony.
- Aren't you gonna do something?
- We're gonna turn in a report.
The hell with the report. What about him?
What about him?
- Listen, you asshole...
- Hey! Excuse me, sir.
You heard me, you goddamn storm trooper,
I'm a taxpayer, God dammit!
So am I.
Good night, Officer.
You goddamn fascist pigs! You assholes!
Forget it, pal.
Toyota's a shitty car anyway.
I'm a cripple.
What kind of research you doing in Who's Who?
Nothing special.
Just, uh, the serious stuff, checking up on the younger generation, you know.
Mmm-hmm.
Where cheerleaders spend the night, that sort of thing.
Where do they spend the night?
Wouldn't you like to know, you sly devil.
You know, Bone, did you ever check out Group Therapy?
- No.
- You ought to.
It's a new disco near the ocean.
Take that guy with you.
Yeah, and?
And that's where Vicki Duran was when last seen.
Boogying the night away with J.J.?
Nope. J.J. was across the street at the El Encanto, just like you said.
Which you didn't buy.
I never said that.
Fact is that he was definitely there.
A little reception for some oil people.
But J.J., old J.J., he left around, uh, 11:00.
Yeah, 11:00.
Where did you get that info, Alex?
PR man at the hotel.
Always glad to help out a reporter for the Sunset Magazine.
Always pleased to help such honored guests.
Even if they are a little sauced.
Yeah, so go on, what else happened?
That's it.
What do you mean, "That's it?"
That's it. What the hell else do you want?
I want to know what the fuck you're up to, man.
You know, I can see you really give a shit if I spend another night in jail, huh?
It's my ass, right?
Well...
The world lacks heroes, Rich.
I don't want to be one.
It's got nothing to do with you.
You never wanted to be one.
- Where you going?
- You can stay here.
Absolutely.
Mi casa es su casa.
And we'll try to hold it down in here for you, too.
Hmm.
Unless you want two strong arms.
Yeah. Slow but steady wins the race.
Hey, there he is, Gazelle Boy.
Had to do it, huh?
Yeah. Like I said, Rich, I press.
One more time, George.
Come on, get up!
Pulled a muscle, gotta take a break.
How are you?
- Okay.
- Good.
Alex has been keeping me busy.
Yeah, he's got a gift for that.
Have you changed your mind?
Changed my mind? What do you mean?
Decided that Cord was the man you saw.
Now what could have given you an idea like that?
Hey, Alex! How you doing?
Hey, Georgie.
Hi, you look great out there, no kidding.
Georgie, this is Valerie Duran.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Vicki Duran's sister, the girl that was unfortunately murdered last week.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Nice, Alex.
Well, can I get anybody some lunch?
Anybody want some lunch?
Sure, sure we could eat right here.
Oh, no. Susie's not up to it.
How about that new French restaurant?
You fooled me, George. That's pretty nice.
Okay, you guys go ahead,
I'll meet you there.
Sure, sure. For coffee, right?
- And the check.
- And the check.
I'll see you there.
Let's go, gang, free eats.
Hey, this is a dead end. Alex knows that.
- He said you'd say that.
- Yeah, I'll bet he did.
I didn't see his face,
I don't want to look at any pictures.
A quote from J.J. Cord.
"I like to pick up hitchhikers.
"Especially young ones.
I like their input."
You know, I would go straight to the DA.
That's an open and shut case, you probably get a medal and everything.
Mmm. There's lots more.
Get up, go ahead, read it, let's string this dude up. Come on.
Alex made some phone calls, and what do you think?
Around midnight, at a gas station on the coast highway, some guy buys two gallons of gas in jeep cans.
Cans, yeah.
He wears a funny hat and glasses.
A funny hat?
Wait a minute, a funny hat.
That's Cord. That is Cord!
Alex, that sounds like
Cord to me, doesn't it?
Doesn't it really sound like Cord?
Funny hats, he's always wearing funny hats all over the place.
Hmm.
- Okay, let me try.
- Come on.
- Look, Rich.
- Yeah.
I'm Cord.
And I got a pint of Chivas in me.
And I'm weaving on home.
And I spot this scrumptious teenybopper.
And, uh, I pull over and I pick her up, innocent that she is, she's flying high on angel dust, Thai stick, heck, God knows what.
And, uh, she gets in.
Only, uh, I'm drunk, so I'm having some trouble.
And she starts to laugh.
And I'm old, and I'm fat, and I'm sweaty.
And she's laughing.
She's laughing and she's choking and she spits my puny cum right in my face.
The fucking bitch.
Bam!
And she ain't laughing anymore.
But...
I'm J.J. Cord.
I turned a wildcat well into a dynasty.
I do not crack.
All I have to do is clean up a very messy car and get rid of the body.
It's fiesta time.
Happens all the time.
Bars get trashed, cars get burned.
Yeah, so?
So we let him know we know.
That's wonderful, that's really...
- What did I miss?
- Hey, not much.
Alex is just making a few jokes about your boss.
- Cord?
- Uh-huh.
This isn't the best place to make jokes about Mr. Cord.
That's Mrs. Cord behind me.
Georgie's got a point. Let's walk.
- Get the check, will you, Georgie Porgie?
- Mmm-hmm.
Hello, Patricia, how are you?
Hello, George. Who are your friends?
Oh, that's Richard Bone, one of my salesmen from the marina.
Oh, I see. Charming.
Enjoy your lunch.
Thank you.
So we pretend blackmail, and then when he pays, we go to the police.
We got him.
Okay, so maybe we don't do that.
Now, Alex admitted he might try to talk us out of that, but whatever, it's up to me because she was my sister...
Okay, let me say something for a second...
- He's got to pay...
- Let me say something, all right?
Let's say you are right, okay?
You're not right, let's say you are, though.
Look, you shouldn't be worried about blackmail, sweetheart, that's not your problem.
Your problem is your ass because if you're right and you mess with this guy, you're going to wind up nailed to the mast of a leaky boat.
If you're right, I'd be careful.
Very, very careful.
Sure.
Sure.
That's why you go shouting out your whole story in a restaurant full of all Cord's friends, people who work for him?
Well, uh, actually, Rich...
You know, uh, I'd say that you're the one that ought to be very, very careful, not us.
You're the witness, remember?
That's right.
Your fantasy, my ass.
All right. So we'll be more careful.
But he can't get away with it.
Oh, no, of course not. The forces of good.
A little blackmail, a little perjury.
We can all retire to a tropical isle, live in luxury.
Hold it, Bone!
You sanctimonious bore.
Who the hell are you anyway, huh?
Fastest dick on the beach?
Hell.
While you were getting laid in the Ivy League,
I was getting my ass shot up.
Don't give me any lectures on morality.
In fact...
In fact, Rich, let me give you one.
Don't tell me, let me guess.
This is going to be the one about how you see life exactly the way it is, right?
Everything's a total crock of shit.
Or is it about your leg?
Oh, please, not the leg. God.
I watched the war on TV just like everybody else, okay?
Thought the same damn things, you know, what you thought when you saw a picture of a young woman with a baby lying face down, dead in a ditch.
Two gooks.
You had three reactions, Rich, same as everybody else.
The first one was real easy.
"I hate the United States of America."
Yeah.
You see the same damn thing the next day and you move up a notch,
"There is no God."
- Yeah.
- But you know what you finally say, what everybody finally says, no matter what?
"I'm hungry."
I'm hungry, Rich, I'm fucking starved.
So you pick out somebody to blackmail?
I didn't pick him out, you did.
And he isn't somebody. He's responsible.
- For the girl?
- For everything.
Him and all the motherfuckers in the world just like him. They're all the same.
So let's blow up AT&T.
You know why they're all the same, Rich?
Because it's never their ass that's on the line, never.
It's always somebody else's.
Always yours, mine, ours.
So leave off the morality, okay?
And don't write me off as a money-grubbing bastard altogether.
Okay.
But you don't need me. Do it yourself.
That way you'd only have to split the money two ways.
It's like trying to seduce a eunuch.
Did they show you Vicki's body?
Well, I just wondered.
'Cause I thought maybe if they had, you'd be with us on this.
Could be.
Where are you going?
Sailing. You want to come, Alex?
- I'd like to.
- Oh.
Maybe revenge isn't the only thing on your mind, huh?
Have fun, girls.
Nothing really counts, does it?
Not much.
Not even murder.
You know what I think, Richard?
You know...
Valerie.
I think we should do what we want to do.
I didn't see his face.
That's not why I'm here.
You don't want this. Watch your back.
Why, don't you?
Because it's got nothing to do with me.
This is Alex's fantasy.
You want to live it out, you do it with him, not me.
I just don't want you getting hurt, that's all.
Don't flatter yourself, Bone.
All right. Then sit down and forget about it.
That son of a...
Where are you going?
What do you care?
Come on, if you wait a second,
I'll give you a lift back to the hotel.
No thanks, I'd rather hitchhike.
Hey, Richie! Hey!
You got a minute?
Yeah.
Look, Rich. I wouldn't mind being in your shoes sometimes.
But I think in the end, you'll tire of all this drifting.
Now just stay on here. Permanently.
Take the customers out.
You look great on the deck.
And anything you sell, you get 5%.
And what do you get?
With you around?
I get to know what Alex is up to.
And speaking of Alex, what's he up to?
Alex. He feels the world's short of heroes.
He's trying to fill the gap.
I don't know about him lately though, Rich.
I mean, it's a little funny, but it's a little more than that.
You know what he said to me last week?
He said he would sell me the next five years of his life.
I mean, that's what he said.
For $50,000.
And in return, he wouldn't damage my merchandise.
Now what does that mean?
Can you believe that?
- I told him he was crazy.
- You got that right.
Where am I going to get that kind of money? And for what?
Ha!
Well, I better get my ass in gear.
- Lock up for me, would you?
- Yeah, sure.
You see? It's not so bad.
A little responsibility.
Just take it one step at a time.
Sooner or later, you're going to have to make a decision about something.
Come on, Tiger, let's go home.
Calcutta, Black Hole speaking.
It's me.
Yeah? Great.
Listen, I've changed my mind.
About what?
Cord.
It's too late.
What do you mean?
I just slashed my wrist.
Well, tape it.
"I will phone your office to arrange a personal meeting with you.
"Time is of the essence.
"Richard Bone, witness."
Brilliant. It's goddamned brilliant.
We got that motherfucker's balls in a vice.
What a team. What a goddamn team, huh.
Not since the Three Musketeers, one for all and all for one.
Mmm-hmm.
- You want me to sign this, right?
- Right.
Nah.
It's my main squeeze, bringing home the bacon.
Ain't she a swell gal, hmm?
You want me to sign this? Tell her.
Blackmail, huh?
What's all this crap?
Food. Real food.
This, for instance, is a tomato.
Food, huh? Yeah, I remember food.
People used to have to eat it during the prohibition, didn't they?
Occasionally, for days on end.
You serious?
I, uh, lost my head.
I was on my way to the Liquor Locker as usual, and, uh, all of a sudden
I got an overwhelming desire to eat.
To eat real food.
I couldn't stop myself.
You know, vegetable, piece of meat.
I tried to stop myself,
God knows I did, Alex.
But then it happened.
7-Eleven.
Food will never catch on, darling.
No.
I'll take everything back, Alex,
I promise.
Why?
Just to make you happy.
You remember a conversation
Rich and I had about a Mr. Cord?
Well, our investigation has proceeded apace, as they say.
Things are beginning to crystallize, and, uh, we are, all three of us,
Rich included, agreed.
It was Cord who killed Valerie's sister.
So we're going to apply a little pressure.
And if he pays, we're going to bust him.
Telling you, it was Bone's idea.
Me? I would have waited.
Wait a minute.
You're going to blackmail J.J. Cord?
And if he pays, you're going to turn him over to the cops with the money?
Is that right?
- You got it, kid.
- This is really insulting of you, Alex.
This is more bullshit than I expect, even from you, in a day.
You're an asshole!
Whatever you say.
It can work. Just like he said.
And that's what I want.
To get Cord and then just turn in the money.
Get fucked, sweetie!
Don't be abusive, Mo.
Abusive, Alex? How could anyone be abusive with the three of you?
A band of would-be extortionists. Really?
Now wait a minute, hold it just one little minute, here.
And let me refresh your burnt-out little memory.
Valerie here did just lose her sister, you with me so far or you want a drink?
And if Cord killed her, very likely, it seems to me that whatever we do falls under the heading of justice.
Justice, pure and simple.
Simple, Alex, hardly pure.
Dishonorable and gutless.
Now, you know a lot about guts, do you?
Oh, you bet I do.
Guts is hanging around in this pigsty month after month, waiting for you to get the nerve to start living again and what does it get me?
You and your fucking cronies in the playpen planning a dumb crime!
I don't see much use in this.
I'm gonna go.
You're a little charmer, aren't you?
I mean, your sister's what, two days in the ground?
And you're already planning how you're gonna cash in.
We're not gonna keep the money.
Oh, shit. Give me a break, will you?
Richard, I'm going.
Wait a minute, hold it.
This was your idea, Bone, telling little mama all about it.
Speak up.
I got nothing to say, Alex.
Of course not. He's got nothing to say!
When does he ever have anything to say?
Or what about you?
You're not some saint avenging the sins of the earth, you know, Alex.
And if you are, what am I doing here?
Oh, I know. I'm like your leg.
Your leg! Sending messages to your brain and there's nothing there anymore.
I wouldn't.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
You think this is the first time?
You make it the last, Alex.
Whatever you say, partner.
I'm sorry.
Someday in Tahiti, we'll look back on all this and, uh, laugh.
There she blows.
Gonna be fine, just fine, Rich, do your thing.
That's easy for you to say.
I'm gonna be the one out there all alone.
On point. Only place to be.
Purple Heartland.
That's where I was, Rich.
Used to call this the wet-ass hour.
Really know how to give a guy confidence, Alex.
Hey, pal, you're just delivering the mail.
Neither rain, nor sleet, nor snow, nor gloom of night...
Can I help you?
Yeah, uh, I'm supposed to meet a friend here.
Hi. I'm here to see Mr. Cord, and, uh...
You're kind of sexy.
Do you have an appointment?
No, no, I don't have an appointment, but I have to see him.
It's a matter of crucial concern to Mr. Cord.
It concerns the night his car was burned.
I'm sure he'd be very, very glad to hear from me, but it has to be from me, personally.
Well, I don't have that authority, I'm sorry.
I'll have to go to my superior,
Miss Ironcrotch.
Yeah?
No kidding. Well you, uh...
You know, you do what you have to do, miss.
If I were you, I'd go as high as I can.
I'm sure Mr. Cord would be very unhappy if too many people knew about this.
You can skip right past Ironcrotch and go on to Mr. Stepan Fetchit.
That's as far as he's gonna get.
Come on, let's go.
Out of sight, man, what happened?
Okay, I pressed the dude, right?
I told him, I said, "Look, this is a very personal, very important letter."
I told him how Cord gonna have his ass if anybody else got a hold of the letter, right?
- That's it!
- That's exactly it.
Now, it's up to him.
- You did it!
- Well, I gotta call him back at 1:00.
He did it! Bonehead did it!
You did it, Boner!
You did it! That Baby Bones!
You're really gonna nail that guy with the huge head and a leeny, teeny weeny, weeny, weeny...
We did it!
It's a grand old flag
It's a high ﬂying flag
Wherever with grace may you wave
It's the emblem of the land I love
The home of the free and the brave
Yay, one more time.
What do you think?
- Oh, I try not to.
- Hmm.
I mean, about me, or about what Mo said.
Vicki only being dead a few days and me trying to cash in.
We all have our reasons.
That's mine, right?
- Rich. Rich! It's time to call Cord.
- One sec.
What do you mean, "One sec?" Call him now.
Hey, I'm gonna win a doll here.
Yeah? You've been trying to win a doll for half an hour. Come on.
Piss me off, Bone.
Give him his goddamned doll.
Give this clown enough to cover any damage.
You'll get it back in a couple hours.
Come on.
Yeah.
He didn't, huh?
Oh, I see. But he gave him the message.
No, I understand. Fine, thank you.
No.
Wait... What does that mean?
- No dice, man, no dice.
- What?
He gave Cord the message. Price gave it to him personally, and that's it.
That's all there is.
Which is nothing, no response.
The murdering bastard.
The murdering bastard!
Shit! Fuck! What can I do? Are you fucked?
Sorry, Alex, there's no sale, you know?
That God damn... That fucking murdering bastard! God damn it!
You fucking shitting me!
God damn! Fuck! Shit!
Fuck! Fuck!
Shit! Fuck!
I didn't deliver the letter, Alex!
Why not?
Because the game's over.
You may be suicidal, I'm not.
Yeah. It takes too much commitment.
Yeah. Yeah, you tickle me, Bone.
Yeah, you know, look!
If you want... If you...
If you don't wanna hang around anymore and you want to go home where the heart is, go!
I'm sure Mo's very lonely, too.
Me?
I'm gonna, uh...
I'm gonna nail the bastard.
Come on, Val. It's you and me.
Mo?
Hello, Rich. Enjoy yourself?
Yes, I did.
Well, they're pretty good, what there is of them.
I'm an eyes man.
- Bloodshot?
- Yeah. Most of the time.
Where's Alex?
He's fighting the good fight.
What about you?
Me? I chickened out.
Amazing. A moment of weakness or sanity?
I don't know.
You know, I was hoping that when nothing happened, this scheme would just dissolve or something, I don't know.
And Valerie. Did she chicken out, too?
No, no. No, she's hanging in till the bitter end.
Hello.
Hi.
Fine.
Wonderful.
Yo.
Hey, look, man,
I wish you all the luck, you know?
You did?
Well, that's terrific.
He's gonna send you a message. Uh-huh.
Thank you, Alex.
Thank you very much.
Yes, I'll tell her.
Okay. We won't expect you.
Bye-bye.
Well, he's done it. Gave Cord the letter.
He's also forgiven me of my sins, and he wanted me to tell you to be sure to be extra nice because my ego has been so badly bruised of late. And...
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.
Well, Rich.
Sanity is positively taking over.
It's an off day.
Speaking of which, do you want to take the day off?
Anything special in mind?
Probably.
We could start with the old stand-bys, you know, loaf of bread, jug of wine...
- Cheese.
- Cheese.
We're old enough to know
And that won't change the way
Your eyes look back like photographs
Of others I can see
We're old enough to know
One night can't take away
Faces look for lovers
But your seeing grabbed on me
We're old enough to know that it can't be
Don't bother, Rich.
Can't remember all the faces
Can't remember half the names
But I remember all the times that were like this
All the thrilling and the chasing
You'd only be disappointed.
I'd lose a friend.
Hmm. I don't think so.
Let's find out.
You really are a slave to it, aren't you?
Gee, Mo, if you don't want to, that's fine, but you don't have to knock the feeling, you know?
You're right. Sorry.
It's a bad habit.
I guess we really don't have that much to lose, do we?
Wait a minute.
This is my big exit
But I'm moving awful slow, slow, slow
Thought it was just another show
And though I know it isn't true
I may just play along ﬁne
But we're both old enough to know how it will end
I'll even say that I love you
I'll even promise I won't lie
- Rich, can I ask you a question?
- Yeah, sure.
Do you still mean any of what you said?
Yeah. I think so.
How much?
I said I love you.
Relax, Rich.
The, um, Richard Bone Fan Club is now complete.
No more holdouts.
Well...
Yes?
Is there something else?
Do you know what I do, Rich?
Sometimes...
Hmm?
You know, when I wake up in the night alone and I can't sleep.
I have to go and look and see if I'm still here.
Mo, I'll be here.
I just stand there, looking.
And I wonder...
I really wonder if I care.
If I ever really cared.
Or if... Or if all I...
...ever do is pretend.
It's... No, Rich, it's not you. It's me.
I'm gonna stay.
Would you?
Just tonight, you know.
Please.
Shh.
Come on.
Never met a man so eager to make a fool of himself on the field of combat.
- Richie! Richard!
- Yeah, I'm down here, George.
- Where's Alex?
- In LA, why?
What happened?
What happened?
Open it.
Mo.
You okay?
I've been better.
Susie wants you to have the guest house for as long as you need it.
- Come on, George. You and Susie?
- Yeah.
Let's go to the polo club, get a drink.
I don't drink.
You know the routine grind drives me to drink. Tragedy I take straight.
I need a drink.
Why don't you go play, George?
I'll stay here with you, there's always a game.
I'd kind of like to watch you play.
I'm gonna score one for you, Alex.
You've been watching too many Babe Ruth movies, George.
It's kind of a funny hat, wouldn't you say?
Like the kind the gas station attendant said the guy with the jeep cans wore.
What, you think Cord killed Mo?
I know he did, so do you.
'Cause of the blackmail letter?
The letter, what a crock.
Jesus, I win the prize.
Alexander Cutter underestimates the rich.
I was one.
It's simple, Rich. It's real easy.
Your picture was in the paper, remember, page one.
He knew who you were from the first and not only you, but me, Valerie and Mo.
You think we haven't been watched?
He may be scared, but he's smart and powerful.
He had your baptism papers within the first half hour, a list of your friends and every broad you've racked for the past ten years.
You never had to deliver any blackmail letter.
All you had to do was go to the Cord Building.
So what are you gonna do?
It's not a question of what I'm gonna do.
It's a question of what you're gonna do with the time you've got left.
They weren't after Mo.
They were after you.
He just didn't see you leave.
The ball is in play.
No, huh?
That night I left...
She was pretty depressed, you know, things got kind of heavy.
You're unbelievable.
You are truly unbelievable.
What a monster fucking ego!
I mean, you walk out on a girl and what choice has she got, she just heads straight for the oven, right?
I mean, what's left her?
Nice, Rich. Really nice. Nice.
- Fuck you!
- When you gonna walk?
I know you're gonna try.
I know you're gonna try to do your little walk.
Richard Bone always does his famous walk.
Walk!
Walk.
Walk.
Walk. Walk.
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk!
Walk. Walk.
Alex!
Alex!
You killed my wifey! You...
They're gonna crucify you!
They'll crucify you!
You're gonna pay!
You're gonna pay!
Walk, walk, walk, walk!
Permission to come aboard.
Come on in, Rich.
I'm worried about you and Alex.
I mean, hassling guys at the local pub is one thing, but J.J. Cord, that's crazy.
Even with Mo and all, he is way overboard.
He's practically barricaded himself in my guest house.
Won't come out, won't let me in.
I don't know what he does for food.
What is this about Cord murdering somebody?
I don't know.
You know Alex. He, you know, picked up on something and won't let it go.
Well, he better.
That sounds a little final, George.
Why? Somebody said something about yesterday?
Look, you know I feel responsible for Alex in a lot of ways.
When my mother died, his mom took me in like a second son.
I know.
Cord has helped me out, too. He set me up.
But he's in a whole other league, they don't play games.
They play for keeps.
Okay.
He presses on this one, and he's in serious trouble.
Now, I have a lot on my mind, so I know you'll take care of him.
I mean, if you need anything, I'm here.
But I don't want to lose him.
Hey. Alex.
Private R. Bone reporting to
General George Armstrong Cutter.
All quiet on the western front, sir!
I think tomorrow is our best bet.
All right, I'll bite. For what?
For a meeting with Cord.
You've got down here he's having a party tomorrow.
Yeah.
I figure I'd like to have as many people around as possible, you know.
I hear he's dangerous.
You've been invited, huh?
'Course I've been invited,
I wouldn't go without an invitation.
We're invited.
This is George's.
I understand if you don't want to have anything to do with this, but I'd like you there.
But it's up to you.
George is pretty frightened.
So am I. Fool not to be.
- Still, it's up to you.
- I mean, he's scared, man.
You know why?
Cord killed his father.
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.
Alex is really around the bend, huh?
This you can check out with Georgie.
You see, in the '30s, his old man used to own the entire marina.
Cord was always trying to buy it from him, but no sale.
Old man Swanson was one tough son of a bitch, he was a great guy.
Anyway, somebody offed his old lady.
That broke him.
He went after Cord.
Unfortunately, he found him.
He got beat up real bad.
Ended up a vegetable and died.
Georgie was just a kid.
He was a kid, but he knew something.
And all of a sudden, Cord started paying extra special attention to him, you know.
Put him through college, put him up in the marina.
Trying to help the poor kid. Sure.
And keep real close tabs on him, too.
So, yeah, Georgie's scared, he's scared shitless.
Has been his whole life.
It's got nothing to do with Georgie.
It's got something to do with us.
So like I say, Rich, it's up to you.
You sure about this, Alex?
Not really.
No, I'm not.
Then what the hell are we doing here?
Cord sent us a message, he killed my wife.
Look.
That last night with Mo, she was depressed.
I mean, she was really depressed.
So, who isn't?
You take it pretty good, don't you?
Which part?
The dying part or the screwing part?
Alex, what's this gonna prove?
It's not like it's gonna change anything.
It's not gonna bring her back.
It's not gonna take away our guilt.
It's no gonna make you whole again, you know that.
Nothing's ever gonna do that.
I, uh... I gotta go, I go.
What are you gonna do, kill him?
That's what I do.
If you want to walk, I understand.
I think Mo'd like this.
She always liked to play dress up.
Excuse me, fellas, uh...
Oh! Excuse me!
Excuse me. I'm Mrs. Cord.
Alexander Richard.
How do you do?
With such a charming hostess, marvelously.
Yes, well, if there's anything I can do, please, uh, let me know.
Okay.
Bone.
- You seen Cord?
- Not yet.
Well, saw his wife in there, she gave me a real weird look.
Then he knows we're here.
Let's go find the murdering bastard.
- Give me the gun.
- Are you serious?
Alex, you look ridiculous, give me the gun.
It isn't loaded.
Let's, uh, mingle.
Howdy, uh, just put your arms around me.
I'm trying to...
I'm trying to avoid somebody.
- Just laugh, like you're...
- I'm supposed to laugh at you?
Just look at me and kiss me.
My God, there are surprises, no wonder you didn't...
Great. I'm Richard Alexander with C.C. & Mutual Investment.
How're you doing?
It's been pleasant chit-chatting with you.
Alex!
- Alex! What are you doing?
- I'm looking for Cord.
I know you're looking for Cord.
Look, will you wait for me?
- Come on!
- Wait!
Come on, let's look.
Let's stick with the crowd.
You stick out too much.
We already checked out the crowd, he isn't in the crowd.
Come on, will you?
I know every room in this house.
Why don't we all go out into the garden?
I've got the most magnificent roses you've ever seen in your life.
Hey! Let's stick with the crowd.
We don't stand out so much.
We checked the crowd. We're looking for
Cord, remember? Come on!
- Hold it right there, fellas.
- Move your ass, Alex!
Come on, Bone!
All right, all right, all right.
All right? Ow!
Mr. Bone,
I do hope you aren't hurt.
Come in, Mr. Bone.
I'll take care of it, my dear. Thank you.
- Mr. Cutter?
- Richard Bone.
How did you find your way into this house?
Uh... We used George Swanson's invitation.
That's right, he just called me.
He seemed quite disturbed.
Not very coherent.
As I understand it, this young friend of yours is pursuing some fantasy of his own, and it includes me. Is that correct?
Something like that.
I don't find that very pleasant, you understand that?
Yes, I do.
A veteran, isn't he?
- Excuse me?
- I understand he's a veteran.
Uh-huh.
Well, I've been in the war.
I know what it does to some men.
I'm willing to talk to your friend if you think it will do any good.
Do you think it will do any good?
Cord!
Alex!
Alex. Jesus.
Alex, it was him!
It was him!
Alex?
It was you.
What if it were?

# Natty dreadlocks
How do I look?
Like a ripe mango.
- Wanna take a bite?
- I'm on a diet.
That's not what I hear. I hear you're not livin' at home these days.
You been like a big old knot ever since you was a boy. You know that?
- Is he invited?
- Mr Bim?
- Mm.
- I doubt it.
I'll be right back.
Hey, boy. You got married, eh? Long time ago I cut up a pretty boy, you know?
You plannin' to cut somebody?
- Hey, man.
- Not "man", "Chief".
Go on, get outta here, Galan, join the party.
- That's my baby in her belly.
- The baby don't make no difference.
- It does to me!
- Then live with it!
- Live with it?
- Yes, man.
I loved the way you did that.
Get him somethin' cool to drink. He has a heap of grief to get off his big chest.
What about my chest?
- How long the offer last?
- You have till sundown.
Watch out for this.
First thing you do is change the bedding.
Then look in the closet.
Yes, Mrs Elgin.
If you see something that needs to be cleaned, take it to the laundry.

(police radio) Chief Quinn.
Calling Chief Quinn.
Respect.
- Thanks, Chief.
- Come in, Chief Quinn.
- Message for Chief Quinn.
- Quinn here.
Get to Pater's place, Chief.
There's been a homicide.
- Who?
- Donald Pater.
Right away.
(siren)
(# "Groove Master" by Arrow)
- Are you all right, Isola?
- Yes.
Don't ya know this is a goin'-down road until 4pm? Which is five hours away.
Seven days a week for the last ten years!
So what are you doin' comin' up it?
- Uncle...
- Don't give me that shit, Maubee.
I didn't figure anybody would be comin' down so fast.
And on my trike, there,
I thought I'd be slippin' through OK.
If I hadn't turned, where would you be?
What are you smilin' about?
The uniform, man. You look great.
Where you been? Parade?
Wedding.
I open this bag, Maubee, what I find, huh?
Nothin' but ladies' clothes.
You gonna give me a ticket, let me call me lawyer first, wait for him to get here.
Even though we're friends, you're lucky I don't have the time.
Xavier!
You forgot to say hello.
Where's the girl who found him?
- She's not here.
- I sent her home.
I can tell you all you need to know.
Mr Elgin.
The body's been examined by a doctor.
He'll be here in a minute.
- I hope you can catch this Maubee fast.
- Why Maubee?
- What?
- You said "I hope you catch Maubee."
Didn't you get his notebook?
I gave it to one of your men.
- Chief Quinn! This gentleman...
- That's all right. We were expecting him.
Just startin' to get a nice draw on the ball, Thomas.
- You the chief of police?
- You the doctor?
Dr Stuhlberg, this is Chief Quinn.
Dr Stuhlberg's a guest at the hotel and he was kind enough to look at the body.
I examined the corpse two hours ago.
He was killed early this morning.
No doubt about the cause of death?
Are you kidding?
With a neck slit like that?
Looks like he's been boiled.
- Call the hospital. Drain the Jacuzzi.
- Very good, sir.
Mmm!
He was a woman-chaser, eh?
You looking for anything in particular?
Why can't we save this looking around till later?
Now I'd like you to make sure the guests know there's nothing to worry about.
Dr Richardson, Chief Quinn for you, sir.
- The family wants the body flown back.
- Cause of death has to be determined.
I'd say that was abundantly clear.
If the murder had taken place on the mainland, Doctor, you would expect an autopsy, wouldn't you?
That's different.
I talked to Governor Chalk.
He's taking care of it.
- Is he?
- Uh-huh.
Call the ambulance.
Take the body to the hospital.
Yes, sir.
Mrs Elgin?
Xavier Quinn. Chief of police.
Hello.
Sit down.
You're a swell dresser.
I like snappy uniforms.
What can I do for you? A drink?
No. No, thank you. I... have to pretend
I'm doing something productive, or else I can't sit here.
Are you being police-polite, Chief Quinn?
I'm trying to get a picture of Mr Pater.
Offshore corporations, numbered accounts, holding companies.
Very active in stamping out communism in Latin America. Friends in high places.
A patriot.
Women?
Native ladies lately, and not so lately.
- Not very discreet about it.
- Wasn't here very often, was he?
(Elgin) Mr Quinn.
I think we've had enough questions for today.
Thank you.
Mr Elgin.
What'd you tell him, Hadley?
Comfortable answers to uncomfortable questions.
Yes, Thomas?
If I'd waited another minute before I came in here, would I have found you both on the floor?
You try not to lose control of yourself until this is over.
Having trouble finding your way out of here?
My sergeant needs a guest list.
Let's try to understand something.
You've been a cooperative man.
That's why you've got where you are.
But this is not your beat.
Being a policeman isn't quite like being a waiter, Mr Elgin.
Let's keep it simple, then,
Policeman Quinn.
All you have to do is to bring in Maubee.
Exhibit A. Tag it.
It's been in the water.
Governor Chalk's been callin'.
Say he want to see you.
- What's goin' on here?
- Murder.
- My God! Don't let them inside here!
- Somebody put this maniac downstairs.
- Nasty way to die.
- Right through the neck.
Athens! Catch.
That's Maubee's notebook.
Every woman in that book, Athens.
Each one of you take a couple of addresses and look in on these ladies.
Remember it's not just procedure we're dealin' with here, but a feelin'.
These people are gonna find it natural to protect him.
So be good, be thoughtful.
Use your brains.
Hey, Chief! Chief, wait!
Your wife, she just called.
Says she wants you to pick up Henry.
Why you don't tell her I was busy?
- She never gave me a chance.
- No, she don't like to do that.
- Should I send somebody else?
- No, no, it's all right. I'll get him.
She wants him home by five o'clock!
$10,000, man.
Yeah, man.
Drink it, man. Come on, earn your money.
Drink it.
Come on! Pour it down!
Police! Police! Police!
Break it up, man!
Stay where you are, Maubee!
- Out of the way! Out the way!
- Hold it right there, I said!
Maubee, if you don't come down,
I'll shoot your ass down!
- Move out the way!
- Don't let him get away!
Move, move, move, move!
Shit!
Hold it right there!
(creaking)
Yeah, man!
McKeon, get him! Run!
- Good afternoon, Governor.
- Good afternoon, Xavier.
I hear things got a little abrasive out there.
- I was just trying to do my job, sir.
- That's why you're here.
I want to know why you're not.
Talking about the body, Xavier.
Sir?
Thomas Elgin called me. I'm concerned.
Christ, why did you have to send the body to the hospital?
It's mandatory procedure in homicide.
You've got the book. You've got the weapon. All you need is Maubee.
- Well, a motive would help.
- Motive? You kidding?
His whole life long that little nigger watches the laughing rich, and finally his poor impoverished heart screams murder. How about that?
It's my job, Xavier, to see that this thing doesn't hurt us.
Us?
Yes, us. The ones responsible for the welfare and economy of this country.
That's Mr Elgin, me, and you.
We've all gotten this far by each of us doing his job. I expect you to do yours.
- Take me home, Willy.
- Yes, sir.
Ah.
A bunch of us are going out for marlin on Friday.
If this mess is through,
I'd love you to come along.
Thank you, sir.
(groans and retches)
- What happened?
- His brain's not working too good, but from what I can tell, Maubee bet him
$10,000 he couldn't do what he did.
- Which was what?
- Drink whatever it is he's throwing up.
- $10,000, huh?
- That's what the man say.
- What happened, Nick?
- Chief, am I gonna die?
Yes, man. But we're gonna try and put it off for a little while.
We're going to take you to the hospital.
You collect your bet?
The police got there before he could pay.
And what make you think him had a $10,000 bill?
I... I see it.
It was green, with the president.
A ten and three zeros.
Nick, there's no such thing as a $10,000 bill.
Send somebody over and check it out.
Also call the hospital about the autopsy.
Already did. Said they had to
send the body to the airport.
Direct orders from Governor Chalk.
Shit. OK.
Do you think Maubee did it?
Cut a man's head off?
That fucker, he does that.
That's why he's like that.
Try and make sense when you talk, Jump.
OK. The little notebook.
But how could he lose a thing like that?
He'd have to stand on his head.
Not if he was going through windows.
Not if there was a struggle.
Yeah. So, you think he did it, then?
No.
Do you?
$10,000 bill.
$10,000 bill.
There's no such thing as a $10,000 bill.
It must have been counterfeit.
Why? If there's no such thing as a 10,000 d... Oh, shit.
- What?
- My son.
(siren)
Oh, great. That was great!
- Why you didn't go home?
- I was waiting for you.
Mm-hm.
- Your mother's gonna be mad, you know.
- At me too?
So... what you learn in school today?
About the fer-de-lance. It's the most poisonous snake in the world.
If he bites you, that's all there is any more.
You go blind and die in 15 seconds.
- You know how it come to be here?
- No.
Well, way back in the old days, plantation owners imported a snake to discourage the escape of slaves.
- That was us.
- Yes, that was us.
But... the snake don't know the difference between black and white.
The snake start bitin' the white man?
- That's right. So you know what they did?
- No.
They brought in the mongoose to kill off the snake.
But you know what them forget? They forget that the mongoose is nocturnal.
See, that means he likes the night, whereas the snake, he likes the day.
So, while one was on his way to work, the other was on his way to bed.
- What you think of that?
- That's the kind of place this is.
Yes.
(faint music )
Let's go.
(# "(I'm) Hurting Inside")
# Happiness, come back, I say
# And if you don't come
I'm gonna go looking, yeah
# For happiness
# And if you don't come
I'm gonna go looking, yeah
# For happiness
# I've done you no wrong, no
# I've done you no wrong, yeah
# Reveal yourself to me
# I say, I say
# I'm hurtin' inside
# You've got to believe me
# I'm hurtin' inside
# I'm hurtin' inside
# I'm hurtin' inside
# I'm hurtin' inside
Come on, Henry. Time for bed.
- So, when you gonna start work?
- We're negotiatin'.
- With who?
- The Tropicana.
Well, good. Congrats.
Why don't you sit down at the piano and help us out?
No, no, no. Just an innocent bystander.
He doesn't play the piano any more.
Probably not innocent, either.
Can I have a word with you, please?
What the hell are you doing? You were supposed to have him here by five.
- Did you forget about him?
- I was busy, Lola.
- Then you should have called.
- I'm runnin' around town all day chasin' a killer. I could've stopped by a phone and given you a call.
You know something?
I want you out of my house right now.
Your house? So it's your house now, is it?
Why you didn't come and pick him up?
I don't know if you have noticed, but I am in the middle of a rehearsal.
Now, that might not mean much to you, but it means a hell of a lot to me!
Besides, I thought you might like to see your son.
Of course I'd like to see my son.
And what do you mean, you were chasing a killer?
I mean somebody killed Donald Pater.
You know who that is?
Of course I know who that is.
How'd it happen?
I don't wanna talk about it right now, but it looks like Maubee did it.
- Maubee?
- Shh!
- Maubee killed Pater? Why?
- Money. Who knows?
I don't believe it. You know as well as I do
Maubee's a lover, not a killer.
Oh, I know.
Maybe when you finish your business here, you can come down to the station... explain your theory to my men, huh?
Put us all on the right track.
- So, where is the body?
- At the airport.
- Do you expect trouble?
- Mm-hm.
- So this is going to be a complicated job.
- Yes.
Come on, get around the other side.
Ready? One. Two. Three.
(aircraft overhead)
Excuse me, sir. Could you be so kind to go and bring me a pan of cold water?
I'm gonna get into a lot of trouble for this.
No, man, no trouble at all.
Then why are we whispering?
Out of respect for the dead.
(laughter)
Good night. And don't forget to tell Chief
Quinn the offer's been extended till dawn.
- You got that?
- I got it.
Chief.
Chief.
- What is it, Coco?
- You just got a visitor.
Maubee.
# Lord, I gotta keep on moving
# Lord, I gotta get on down
Xavier!
Xavier!
I need to talk!
# I've been accused of a killing
# Lord knows I didn't do
# For hanging me they are willing, yeah
# That's why I gotta get on through
# Lord, they're comin' after me
# Lord, I gotta keep on movin'
Been seen coming out of the mountains, selling ganja to the tourists at the Holiday
Inn, flashing big money at the Hilton, and getting a shoeshine in French Town.
Let him know that they're after his ass and he's bang into the fourth dimension.
- Not with the chief.
- Why not the chief?
- Chief and him grew up together.
- Who never grew up together?
Not like that. Maubee and the chief is like two crossed fingers.
- He's not gonna trust the police.
- A brother trusts a brother.
Bullshit, man.
You never even see the bastard.
- But his footprints are everywhere.
- The man's fucking dedicated.
Yeah, but to what?
It's not hard to figure out.
The man typifies what's wrong with this whole island.
He invented a life because he can't face what's expected of him.
He's no more important than we let him be.
He's just a man.
And we're goin' catch him ass.
It look to me like while I'm doing overtime lookin' for him, him livin' my vacation.
- You want a vacation, McKeon?
- No, sir.
- Then tell me something smart.
- Well...
I found out who him's sleepin' with this week.
Who?
- Isola.
- Isola?
Yeah, man, the witch's niece.
Chief, Governor Chalk just called.
Say him want you over there right now.
Shit.
What the hell you mean tearing up the body at the airport?
Mandatory procedure in homicide.
Looked like someone's trying to prevent this so badly, it's worth a look.
Remember what happened...
- It was ten years ago.
- The place hasn't recovered.
You can't compare 12 white men shot by black extremists...
Yes, I can.
So will every asshole tourist who doesn't get off the big boat in the next ten years.
If you don't catch Maubee fast, you gonna be shovelled out of your office quicker than dog shit.
That's not gonna stop me from finding Pater's killer.
And anyone else who helped him cover it up.
One of you gentlemen got a match?
This is Mr Miller, Quinn.
He's with Pater Enterprises.
Thanks.
- He's here to tie up loose ends.
- Like what?
I'm here to see that the interests of Pater
Enterprises aren't damaged in any way.
I've already given him the basics.
Why don't you take him to Pater's?
You can fill him in on the way.
You don't think Maubee did it, do you?
Not for me to say.
That's for the courts to decide.
I have a lot of stops to make, and I don't want to spoil your plans. If you want to...
No, no, no, that's fine. I love it.
Show me everythin' you got.
How you doin', Gumma?
What you want here, boy?
I want to talk to Isola.
She not here.
You try come in here, I fight you.
You fight me, I arrest you.
You can't arrest me.
Me don't do nothin'.
You think I'm jokin', Gumma?
I put a curse on you!
Believe me, I already got a curse on me.
Ah-ah!
You want take me picture, it cost you!
- How much?
- Two dollar.
(shutter clicks)
- This Isola's child?
- Call it what you want.
You don't seem too happy about it.
- What's in the chest?
- Why don't you open it and find out?
(woman laughs)
You're going to get in trouble fuckin' with me, Gumma.
- Who the hell was that?
- Ubu Pearl, the local witch.
I'm gettin' to like this place more and more.
I'm lookin' for Maubee.
I don't know why anybody would be tellin' somebody he be here.
- What about you?
- Not me, man.
I don't know nothing.
Nobody's going to help you catch him,
Chief. Nobody knows shit.
Turtle.
- Maybe you saw him.
- Not exactly.
Well, where exactly didn't you see him?
There was a guy at the Tropic Eagle looking for him.
- What guy?
- A white guy.
- What kind of white guy?
- Kind of a dark white guy.
Wearing silver sunglasses and a fancy hat. A cowboy hat.
Percy, see to the customers.
Yes, sir.
You're gettin' everything straightened out.
I would consider it a favour if you wouldn't come here in your uniform.
Why?
(loudly) Am I upsetting the guests?
You're out of line, Quinn.
This is a resort, not a police station.
The way I dress, Elgin, is the last thing you should be worried about right now.
What should I be worried about, Mr Quinn?
You think you have it made, don't you?
You come here and do what you want, take what you want, kill who you want.
You're fucking nuts.
- You've gone too far.
- I'm goin' all the way.
No, you won't.
You're finished.
You won't be around, boy.
You watch out, white man.
You watch out.
Now get out of here... before I have you thrown out.
Call the police.
Look like you're missin' somethin' here.
What do you think it could be?
A court dagger, 18th-century Indonesian ceremonial machete with a pearl handle.
- Is it the murder weapon?
- Is it?
- How did you get in here?
- The uniform does it.
I heard someone a few weeks ago while
I was sleeping. I came down to check.
- Where was your husband?
- In his bedroom.
Go on.
It was Maubee. He was here to steal.
What?
Anything he could get, I guess.
He got the machete.
He liked it so I gave it to him.
What else?
What else do you do with a big old tomcat?
If he's friendly, you play.
- I see.
- Do you?
No.
Do you ever let down your guard?
Couple of weeks ago
I shaved off my moustache.
Did your husband know what happened here that night?
Forget what you're thinking.
Thomas may look like a man of action, but that's as far as it goes.
- Well, what have you got there?
- Somebody had a look around.
- Who?
- I don't know.
How come this Maubee never did time?
Got a rap sheet a mile long.
Well, local opinion pretty much takes care of things around here.
You mean the people protect him?
He does things people can't and probably wish they could. Somethin' like that.
Local legend, huh?
Never grew up, that's all. Just like everyone else, but he never even tried.
- Peter Pan.
- Bugs Bunny.
You're not Elmer Fudd, are you?
- I hope not.
- (Miller laughs)

Muzzle velocity so slow.
You an assassin, Patina?
You with a foreign government?

- I can make my phone call now?
(Quinn makes siren noise)
Pull over, ma'am, and cut your engine.
What seems to be the problem, Officer?
Oh, you in trouble, ma'am.
You obstructin' a roadway here.
With what?
You have a licence for that?
- You'd better watch yourself.
- Why?
- I have connections.
- With who?
I know the chief of police.
He can't help you now.
He's scared and lonely these days.
I hear he has family problems.
- I got to go, Xavier.
- Where you goin'?
- We have the audition tonight.
- Maybe I come and see you.
Don't.
# Xavier!
# Even when you was bad you was good
# And that's just one of the many, many, many reasons I can't live without you
- Drop it, Xavier.
- Then talk to me.
We already talked and we're not going to talk again.
Try.
- You changed on me, Lola.
- I did not change. You changed.
- I'm not going to fall into this trap, Xavier.
- What trap?
Being your stupid wife while you mess your head up with shit you never wanted.
All I was trying to do was find a way.
I'm trying to make it better for both of us.
How? By waitin' to get invited to the governor's lawn parties?
Let me tell you, you never will be because you're not one of them.
But then again, you're not you either, so tell me, who are you?
You may cut a man's head off, but it doesn't necessarily mean you kill him.
Especially if he's already dead.
Which seems to be the case in this case.
The victim died suddenly, but not instantaneously, due to the combination of searing, profound pain, and the emotional shock of watching his arm turn deeply cyanotic.
That means, uh, purple.
- Yeah. Yeah. Go on.
- He died of a snake bite.
I got this raasclat cowboy followin' me around - bogus papers, concealed weapon!
He makes one phone call, and before the hour's up,
Governor Chalk has him released - because he gets a call!
I don't care if him gets a call from God!
It's my department!
- Also, we got...
- Never mind "Also, we got."
- Sir!
- How come you let this bastard go?
If you wanna be chief of police, why you don't just move over to my office?
He had a writ. The man sent a lawyer.
There was nothing I could do.
- I'm gonna rearrest him.
- Quinn.
Look, Pater died from poison.
From a snake. He was already dead when he got his head cut off.
- So, what's that mean?
- It means Maubee didn't do it.
But that's for the courts to decide.
Wait. I just want to know one thing now. Is this for real?
- Or is someone playin' a number on me?
- What do you mean?
I'm not sendin' an innocent man to jail for someone else's game.
Look, don't spread this thing out too far, Xavier, or it's gonna get so thin you won't have shit.
- You mean like my job?
- I mean like your ass.
Well, maybe I should apply for poultry inspector.
What?
Chickens, Chalk.

- (Quinn) You want a beer, Jump?
- (Jump) Do the damned need salvation?
I'm makin' my complaint about Lieutenant Jump Jones.
He's not given me no phone and I want it now.
And I'm not goin' out to make no calls.
- (Jump) Who would you call?
- Never mind my personal business.
That lizard fish with the cowboy hat gets to make one call and out he goes.
You want get out, Coco?
You're a tricky man.
Never mind the phone.
- Aren't you ever going to stop?
- Never.
Because that's the way I am.
I am the blight and scourge of the jails.
I am the vengeance of the poor-assed prisoner man.
You sure are.
- Chief! Chief! Chief, you got a phone call!
- Who?
Hi.
- Can I offer you a drink?
- Yes, uh, rum, please.
Who tried to strangle you? Your husband?
No.
Tell me, then.
Hey, brother, come over here! Come here!
Una, come inside.
You ever been in jail?
Those Sandinistas had me for 18 months, and I'm still trying to wash it off.
(siren)
Pat, we got a little problem.
I came to pick up the money, the money's gone, Pater is dead.
What am I supposed to do?
Number one, you don't let 'em know you're looking by tearing up the room.
So what? Our people need the money to buy weapons.
And then you try to choke information out of the lady when a little talk could've told you she didn't have it.
How do you know she didn't?
Number three's the dilly. Followin' the fuckin' chief of police around because you think he'll lead you to the money.
Yeah? Well, he happens to be the only one who knows el cabrón who stole it.
Yeah, sneaky little rip-off bushman.
Hey, you don't have to worry about him.
I'm gonna take care of that problem.
You got a new agenda.
- What do you mean?
- You're goin' home.
Operation's over.
- Because the old man is dead?
- No. Pressure's on up there.
Washington changed its mind.
No more hand-outs.
That's why I'm here, to take the money back.
Until I hear from my colonel,
I'll do what I was sent to do.
Now, I imagine you would tear this place apart, and bare-handed, huh?
Swim back to your people with the money between your teeth if you had to.
You bet. And you stay out of my way, white trash. Or I'll kill you.
Come on, relax.
You step out of what you were, and you don't come back to what you've been.
- Some people don't trust you no more.
- How?
Did three years in the US Marines.
Another in Quantico.
What's Quantico?
FBI school.
You get... two certificates there.
One... just because you attended.
And the other one is for... academic achievement.
So here I am.
Chief of police... on an island where the poultry inspector gets to be governor, and a guy who lies on his back smokin' ganja and gettin' laid his whole life long gets to be a hero.
- You like Bugs Bunny?
- Yeah, pretty much.
- What about Elmer Fudd?
- No, I don't like him.
Yeah, I don't like him either.
I better go.
Quinn.
Are you sure you want to leave?
Then why are you leaving?
You liked me this morning.
I like you now.
I can't.

(# "Groove Master" by Arrow)
Get in. I got us a ride here.
Yes, man. In a stolen car.
It's not stolen.
It's the governor's, bought by the sweaty taxes of hard-workin' people.
What's him need it for? Him sleeping.
It's a touching story.
You're goin' up for murder, Maubee.
You're goin' to jail.
- Why do you think we're doin' this?
- What? This?
- Right now. This.
- Because you are a fuckin' lunatic who got his ass in a mess and don't know what to do.
That's not why I picked you up.
Jesus!
Not because I'm in a mess, but because you and your men couldn't catch me.
- I never even tried.
- You tried to run me off the road.
- I could have shot your ass.
- You could now.
I might.
Your ass! Your ass!
(chuckling)
Soon come. Soon come.
- Isola...
- So how's the missis?
Ha, let's not spoil a good thing, hm?
You?
Isola...
She come out nice, man.
- Ubu Pearl.
- Who? The witch?
Yeah, man. Isola's aunt.
She only let me visit on Monday night.
What happen if you don't?
I get the hex.
My dick fall off and I wake up dead.
Shit, man!
- You better stick to your schedule.
- Yeah, man.
Yes, man. It's truth.
Truth.
Truth.

Lola say if she met me today... sure as hell she'd never marry me.
She say I changed.
Ah, she probably right.

Isola!
- All right, cool down!
- What do you want?
- Cool down!
- What do you want?
- Help me find him.
- He didn't do it.
- Do what?
- Kill any man.
- How you know?
- I was with him.
All right, all right. I believe you.
So tell me now.
If you don't, I can't help him.
I need to find him to do this.
You believe me?
Yeah.
- All right.
- He's at your house.
What house?
Where you were boys and grew up together.
All right.
(chattering)
A ten with three zeros.
If the bank can't help you, then try the Treasury Department on the mainland.
See if there's such a thing as a $10,000 bill.
(siren)
But there's no such thing as a $10,000 bill.
Yes, man! Yes, there is.
Issued in the '20s and again in the '50s.
Any bank that gets one has to turn it over to the Secret Service, and they tuck it away in the Treasury Department.
- And?
- All right.
Let's say the White House believes in this revolution. Hm?
Promises to support it.
Except Congress doesn't agree.
But there is this bundle of money in the reserves, currency no one will miss and no one knows is gone.
But the bagman's killed, the money has vanished, and the heat is on.
So what do they do? They decide to take the money back and plug up the holes.
Bye-bye, Patina.
Are you saying Pater brought the money?
That is exactly what I'm saying.
And Patina was here to pick it up.
Christ! Well, how come they didn't send somebody down here?
What are you talkin' about?
We have two dead people. Of course they sent someone. He was here.
- Nobody told me.
- I'm tellin' you.
Look, I didn't come in here to hear myself talk. I want you to do somethin'.
Uh-huh.
Well, the best thing we can do is to stay out of the way.
Governor, I'm in the way.
Hide your body, girl.
Make yourself and the baby unseen.
Somebody comin'!
- How you doin', mama?
- What you want?
- I wanna talk to your niece Isola.
- She not here.
Where to?
We'll have to get her to talk. Ubu Pearl.
- Who?
- The witch.
Let's go!
The money has got to go back to where it belongs.
You wanna tell me what you know?
I know nothing for you.
You know about the money.
I'm not the bad guy. I'm just doin' my job.
I need your help.
(chuckles)
You gonna die.
Come on. You know everythin', you're not tellin' me nothin'.
I give you a thing make your heart forget to beat, your blood on fire!
Make you squirm on the dirt like maggots.
I die, you die.
What happens if you die first?
I still gon' kill you!
Come on. It's too hot for this.
Talk to me.
Come on, mama. Talk.
(siren)
It's OK. It's all OK.
Tell me what you saw.
Tell me what you saw.
- The fat American.
- Yeah?
He killed my auntie.
- Him kill her.
- OK.
We did a bad thing.
All of this because we did something bad.
No time for that. If the fat American gets to
Maubee before I do, then Maubee is dead.
You understand me?
Now, did Ubu Pearl tell the fat American where Maubee is?
- I don't know. I couldn't hear.
- Then you tell me now. Where is he?
Where's Maubee?
Maubee?
Maubee.
I know you're in here, dammit.
(crash)
- What the fuck you do that for?
- When we were children, old Thunderstone said you were better than me, man.
I hope you're havin' a good time.
Cos you don't have much time left.
- I not dead yet.
- There's a man who wants you dead.
Then I'm glad you got here first.
Playing's over. This is no time for games.
Maubee.
Come on, Xavier!
Old Thunderstone was right.
Isola's baby...
It's Pater's, isn't it?
Who killed Pater, Maubee?
Snake.
Right.
- You know that, huh?
- Yeah, man.
And I think I know who did it.
But I don't know why.
You killed a man who was already dead.
And Ubu Pearl, if that's who you're protectin'... she gone.
She was murdered today.
- Murdered by who?
- By the man sent here to get the money.
- Isola and the baby?
- They're all right. They're OK.
But listen to me now.
They don't care about Isola.
They don't care about anything.
It's only the money they want.
Tell me.
Please.
I sneak into Ubu Pearl's to see Isola.
But she was gone.
The witch catch me.
I find out Isola's gone to Pater to leave the snake.
Back up.
Before all this,
Ubu Pearl go to Pater.
She say "You make Isola pregnant.
You have to pay!"
Pater say "Fuck you, old lady!"
And him laugh. And him laugh!
She say...
"I put a spell on you."
But the spell don't work.
And Isola lose her job at the hotel.
So Ubu Pearl consult her magic... to tell her what to do.
It tell her... to go... leave the snake.
I ride... like hell.
- But I was too late.
- What you see?
The suitcase on the bed with the money,
Pater on the floor.
Why you use a machete?
To make the whole thing seem like something it wasn't.
- And the Jacuzzi?
- I figure if him boil a little, the snakebite might not show so good.
(distant helicopter)
- Do you hear that?
- Yeah, man.
I go get the money.
(helicopter approaches)
You blew it, Miller!
- What'd you say?
- I said "You blew it, Miller."
So now you're supposed to kill me.
I don't need to kill you, Quinn.
You're too little and this is too big.
It never happened and I was never here.
But, of course, that all depends on your friend in there.
(gunshot)
Hey, man!
Here. The money's in the bag.
- Don't!
- Here, man!
Here, man!
Heroic deeds'll get your ass killed, Chief.
Watch out!
Maubee!
Maubee!
Shit!
Maubee! Let go!
- You're crazy, man!
- I wish I could!
(pilot groans)
Pull up, man! Pull up!
Tell me about Maubee.
- What do you want to hear?
- How come he was so special?
Maybe because he never got in his own way.
For instance, when we were kids, he used to stand under a big old tree, like that.
- And you know what he could do?
- What could he do?
He could spot which one of them pieces of fruit was gonna be the next one to fall.
Yes. He would just raise his arms up in the air, and that coconut would just drop right into his hands.
Was he as big as you?
- No. He wasn't so big.
- Then how come he was so special?
(Quinn chuckles)
I don't know.

EN HOH
Mom, there is one thing
I'd like to ask you.
- Sure.
- How do they make that slime
- they're always dumping on you?
- Oh, well.
First they take some water.
Some liquid.
And then they add some
JELL-O powder and some flour.
Sometimes some soap.
Then they dump it all over me.
You gotta get going, kiddo.
We're going to be late.
Where do they dump it from?
Actually, Vanessa, I've always wondered that, too. I just don't know.
Very interesting. Is it always green?
Well, yeah, it usually is, but I guess it could be red.
Or it could be blue.
Or yellow.
- Daddy, telephone.
- Thanks, darling.
Hello?
Hi. No, I'm fine. I just stubbed my toe.
Hang on one second, will you?
Honey, it's Hildy.
I'll call her back.
She's in the bathroom.
She wants to know what you're wearing.
My black suit.
She's gonna wear her black dress.
Well, it's gonna be business.
You know how those things are.
Ellen, I don't want you messing with my make-up now, honey, okay? I'm late.
- Is her red dress okay?
- It's perfect.
Did you hear that? You got it.
Okay, darling, see you later. Bye.
Oh, man.
I told you a million times not to play with my lipstick, right?
So when are you gonna listen to me, huh? Silly girl.
Honey, where's my blue suit?
It's on the back of the door.
Oh, shit!
Shit, shit, shit!
Shit, shit, shit.
Shit, shit, shit.
- Hi, Ellen.
- Hi, Christine.
- How are you doing?
- Good.
- Where's Mommy?
- Mom? She's in the bathroom.
Ellen, I got you a present.
- You want to see what it is?
- Yeah, yeah.
Do you like it?
Okay. Come on, let's go find Mommy.
So then she's taking me to have...
She's pregnant, she's going to give birth.
Hiya, Chuck. How are you? Good to see you. You gonna make it Friday?
- Friday, I'm there.
- We need you, pal. We're in the cellar.
- You know that. Okay.
- Okay.
Dan, is my hair okay?
- You look great.
- I'm serious.
You're the prettiest woman in the room, sweetheart.
You liar.
Dan! Danny!
- Hiya, Bob. How are you?
- Glad you could make it, Dan.
Listen, I'm sorry about the meeting tomorrow.
I know it's a Saturday, but we've got a real crisis here.
Oh, no, I understand.
You know my wife Beth? Bob Drimmer.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- I hope you like sushi.
- Thank you. I love it, Bob. Love it.
- What did he do to his neck?
- He was screwing his wife.
- Are you serious?
- Am I serious?
Absolutely, you should see his wife.
They had to take her out on a stretcher.
- Hi, darling.
- You guys are bad.
Who wants champagne? Champagne?
Let's go.
- Champagne for everyone.
- Hemlock! With a twist.
Four champagnes over here.
Excuse me. Hi.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.
- Excuse me.
Jesus! Thank you. Fuck.
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.
So, what great cultural event are we here to celebrate tonight?
- Some exercise manual.
- Not another one?
This one's different.
Based on ancient samurai discipline.
Danny, look at this guy nod.
What is that, part of the ritual?
Hey...
Hi, there.
- Jesus, if looks could kill...
- Glad to see you haven't lost your touch.
- I think she likes me.
- You do, huh?
- I think she wants me.
- I think you're batting zero for two, and I don't want to know you.
- She was undressing me with her eyes.
- You think so? Good luck, pal.
She had trouble with the buttons.
A signed COPY-
- Here you are, ma'am.
- Oh, thank you, dear.
- Can I get a champagne, please?
- You got it.
I'm not saying anything.
I'm not even gonna look.
Was it that bad?
Let's just say I was glad I wasn't on the receiving end of that one.
Cheers.
Just gotta hate it when guys think they can come on like that.
Jimmy's okay. He's just a little insecure, like the rest of us.
- My name is Dan Gallagher.
- Alex Forrest.
Nice to meet you.
What is your connection here?
I'm an editor at Robbins & Hart.
And you?
I'm with Miller, Goodman and Hurst.
I do all your legal work.
I haven't seen you around their office, though.
I've just been with them a couple of weeks.
I have to go.
- Is that your wife?
- Yeah.
Better run along.
It was very nice to meet you.
"Make concessions with your body."
What does this mean,
"make concessions"?
- Oh, give me a break.
- Give you a break?
What does this mean?
How many did you buy?
- Well, thanks again, Christine.
- Any time, Mrs. Gallagher.
Good night.
Aren't you forgetting something?
Quincy, let's hit it, pal.
You're such a good boy, yes.
You did such good business.
You did good business.
You're the best boy.
Good night.
It's just for tonight, honey.
When you first see the house, don't show any interest at all,
- otherwise we can't negotiate.
- Will you stop worrying about it?
- Ellen, are you chewing gum again?
- What's to worry, though?
- We can't afford it anymore.
- Daddy, is Granny going to be there?
- Just up the road from Mom and Dad.
- Yes.
- Which is another reason not to buy it.
- I didn't hear that.
What's to worry about?
Can't afford the goddamn thing, anyway.
Oh, come on. Hold on to him, honey.
Let's just not worry about it, okay?
I haven't even seen the damn place yet.
I may not even like it.
Ellen? The gum? Thank you.
Come on, Quincy. Come on, boy.
No, honey. Quincy's got to stay here with Daddy. Daddy's gonna be all alone.
Sorry, Quincy. Now, you're not gonna forget to walk him, are you?
- I promise.
- You promise.
Okay. You have a good meeting.
- Okay. See you tomorrow night.
- Love you.
Two times down, third time up, he looked like a jellyfish.
- Hi, Bob.
- Hi, Dan. Sorry to ruin your weekend.
Please, give my apologies to your lovely wife.
- David, hi.
- Help yourself.
- So, how are you feeling?
- Don't ask.
Henry's out of town, so I asked
Alex Forrest to stand in for him.
- Anybody know where she is?
- She's on her way.
Well, since we've got a little time, maybe you can tell us exactly what happened to your neck, Bob.
That's cute. Very cute.
Sorry I'm late. I was getting the file.
Dan, this is Alex Forrest, our new associate editor.
- We've met before. Hi.
- Yeah, hello.
- Okay. Can we get started, Dan?
- Okay, here's the story.
You want to publish a novel in which one of the characters is a senator from New Jersey who's fooling around.
Now, there's a certain congressman from Ohio who claims the character's based upon him, and he's filed an injunction against the publication.
Look, the congressman's bald.
This guy has hair.
They're from different states, for Christ's sake.
Look, if we don't sell those books, we're screwed.
Well, that's all fine, but if I'm gonna go to court to prove the senator's not based upon this congressman, then I have to know the truth.
Now... Well, strictly between these walls, all right?
Did the author have an affair with Mr. Ohio or not?
Yeah, she did.
But she also had a lot of affairs with other politicians.
Any one of them could make the same claim.
She swears this character's fictitious.
I just got off the phone with her.
And you believe her?
Yeah, I believe her.
Okay, now that we've got that on the table, what can we do to lift that injunction?
If we believe the girl, is there some way we can get to the congressman?
They take campaign contributions.
Can we buy him off?
Can we frighten him off?
Is there something in his past that we can find out about?
I mean, we need to use some leverage.
I got 25...
Give me a break, will you?
Come on.
Come on!
Come on.
- Was it made in Taiwan?
- Yeah. These are tough to find.
Wait, wait. Here. We got one.
Come on!
What do you say, you want to go get a drink till it stops?
- Yeah, I'd love it.
- Okay.
Come on.
The strangest case I ever handled?
Well, the truth was,
I never actually handled a case.
The strangest case I ever came near to was when my parents got divorced.
And my mother asked me to represent her.
- You're kidding?
- That's what I said.
"What do you mean?" she told me.
"You know what an asshole the guy is."
"You've been a witness to this marriage for the past 29 years."
Can you believe this?
This is coming from my mother.
No. How did you get out of it?
Well, you can't exactly turn your mother down.
So, I escaped on a technicality.
- Which was what?
- I didn't practice family law.
And it was true, you know.
And she bought it.
- You're making this up.
- Could I make something up like that?
Waiter?
I've got a lot of pull here, you know.
My favorite restaurant.
- Yeah, I noticed.
- They know me well. Miss?
- You want coffee?
- I'd love one.
Can we have two coffees, please?
Well, I tell you, it's a...
- Do you want one?
- No, thank you.
It's funny being a lawyer, you know.
It's like being a doctor.
Everybody's telling you their innermost secrets.
Oh, God.
- You must have to be discreet.
- Oh, God, yeah.
Are you?
Am I what?
Discreet.
Yes, I'm discreet.
Me, too.
- Can I ask you something?
- What?
Why don't you have a date tonight?
It's Saturday night.
I did have a date.
I stood him up.
That was the phone call I made.
Does that make you feel good?
It doesn't make me feel bad.
So, where's your wife?
Where's my wife?
My wife is in the country with her parents, visiting them for the weekend.
And you're here with a strange girl, being a naughty boy.
I don't think having dinner with anybody is a crime.
Not yet.
- Will it be?
- I don't know. What do you think?
I definitely think it's going to be up to you.
I can't say yet.
I haven't made up my mind.
At least you're very honest.
We were attracted to each other at the party. That was obvious.
You're on your own for the night.
That's also obvious.
We're two adults.
Let's get the check.
- Oh, that was great.
- Oh, thank God. Thank God.
Are you feeling energetic?
What do you have in mind?
- How you getting home?
- I don't know, I live upstairs.
- This is the building?
- Yeah.
Well, where do I get a cab, you know?
Have you ever done it in an elevator?
- Not recently, no.
- I bet you haven't.
Oh, I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry.
How are you?
Hi. What happened to you?
I tried you earlier. I'm gonna go...
I guess you're not back yet.
Well, I'm gonna go to bed now, so call me in the morning. Bye-bye.
Hello? Oh, Dan, darling, we were expecting you.
- I'm sorry. I had work to do.
- That's a pity.
We really wanted you to see that house.
- Well, I'll see it next time.
- Yes, of course.
You want to speak to Beth?
- Yes, please.
- Yes, all right.
The phone, it's Dan. Here you are.
Well, hello. What happened to you?
Hi...
Nothing. I just went out and had dinner with Bill last night.
How is he?
He's... Bill's, you know...
Bill's Bill, the same as usual.
Is he still with that girl?
Well, he wasn't last night.
I think it's over.
He really didn't seem like he wanted to talk about it.
- So, are you getting any work done?
- Yeah, I'm working.
Oh, listen, there's some of the spaghetti sauce in the refrigerator, if you get hungry.
Great. Okay. How's Ellen doing?
She is having the best time.
I just hope that Dad survives it.
Honey, I don't know how to tell you this.
But... She wants a rabbit.
Beth, no rabbits.
Jesus Christ! This goddamn family's turning into Noah's Ark.
I mean, please! Give her a kiss, all right? But no promises.
- All right.
- When are you coming home?
- Well, it's getting complicated.
- Why's that?
There's a problem with the house.
They sold it.
Very funny. No. We can't get in to see it until late this afternoon.
I'm not up to fighting the traffic.
I thought I would come in tomorrow.
What about school?
She's only 5 years old.
What's she gonna miss? Trigonometry?
Yeah, okay. All right.
Well, then I'll see you when I get home from work.
Okay. See you tomorrow.
Okay, thanks. Have a good time.
Yeah?
What happened? I woke up.
You weren't here. I hate that.
- You didn't get my note?
- What note?
I left you a note right by your bed.
Oh.
That's nice. I thought we were going to spend the day together.
Alex, look, I've got so much work to do today. I can't.
Why don't you just come over?
I'll cook us lunch.
I got to take the dog for a walk.
The poor dog has not been out of this house all day.
I got to take him out.
Well, bring the dog. I love animals.
I'm a great cook. Come on.
Listen, I'd love to, but I can't.
All right? I really can't.
Do what you have to do, then come over afterwards.
We can always eat late.
Or you can work here.
I won't disturb you, I promise.
I'll be a good girl.
Yeah, you don't give up, do you?
You just don't give up.
Come on!
Come on!
Quincy, no! Quincy!
I got it! I got it! He's free!
Quincy, cover me. I'm on it.
Go deep. He fires. Throws...
- Okay.
- She's got it. Yes. It's back.
Over the head. He's got it.
Dan? Dan!
Dan? Dan, can you hear me?
Oh, my God!
- You bastard.
- Your face!
Your face!
- That was a shitty thing to do.
- I'm sorry. I was just fooling around.
My father died of a heart attack.
I was 7 years old.
It happened right in front of me.
Honey, I'm sorry.
Really, I had no idea. If I did, I never would have done anything like that.
Wait, he didn't die? He's alive?
Yeah, he's alive and well and living in Phoenix.
I guess you certainly got me, didn't you?
Let's hear it.
I hope you like spaghetti.
Specialty of the house.
It goes with the opera.
It smells so good.
- Anything else for me to do?
- No, nothing.
Just make yourself at home.
- You can change the tape if you want to.
- No, this is great.
I love Madame Butterfly.
- Really? It's my favorite opera.
- Mine, too.
It's the first opera I ever saw.
My father, he took me to the old Met.
I was 5 years old.
- Did it make any sense?
- I got most of it.
There was this US sailor setting up house with this Japanese lady.
That was all fine.
But in the final act, after he left her, my father told me,
"She's gonna kill herself."
And I was terrified.
I was...
I climbed right underneath the chair.
It's right here.
This is it. It's right...
It's funny.
- What?
- It's one of the only times...
...I remember my father being nice to me when I was a kid.
Comforting me at Madame Butterfly.
What?
What are you thinking?
I was wondering why is it that all the interesting guys are always married.
Well, maybe that's why you find them interesting, the fact you can't have them.
How long have you been married?
Nine years.
- Do you have any kids?
- I got a 6-year-old girl.
Sounds good.
Yeah, I'm lucky.
So what are you doing here?
Boy, you know how to ask the wrong thing.
No, I really want to know.
I had a wonderful time last night.
I'd like to see you again.
Is that so terrible?
No.
I just don't think it's possible, now.
It's really strange.
I feel like I know you already.
I just want to know where I stand.
I think you're terrific.
But I'm married.
What can I say? I...
Just my luck.
Shit!
- What are you doing?
- I gotta go.
I thought you said she wasn't coming back till tomorrow.
She's not, but I got things to do, honey.
I got to go home.
- You know, I don't think I like this.
- Like what?
The way you run away after every time we make love.
Well, Alex, what difference does it make whether I leave now or in the morning?
The fact is, I gotta go.
- Well, you're not gonna leave now.
- Oh, come on. Will you stop it?
- I mean it.
- Come on! Hey, Alex! Come on!
What's the problem?
I'm sorry.
Jesus Christ, I mean, let's be reasonable.
Be reasonable? What?
"Thank you, goodbye.
Don't call me, I'll call you."
Look, you knew about me, all right?
I didn't hide anything.
- I thought it was understood.
- What was understood?
The opportunity was there, and we took it.
- Come on now, we're adults, aren't we?
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I thought we could have a good time.
- No, you didn't.
You thought you'd have a good time.
You didn't stop for a second to think about me.
That's crazy. You knew the rules, Alex.
What rules?
Look, Alex. I like you.
And if I wasn't with somebody else, maybe I'd be with you. But I am.
Please, don't justify yourself.
It's pathetic.
If you'd tell me to fuck off,
I'd have more respect for you.
All right then, fuck off.
And you get out!
I'm going.
Why don't you come over here and say goodbye nicely?
Let's be friends.
Baby, no.
It's okay.
It's okay.
- Sorry if I upset you.
- It's okay, it's okay, really.
It's okay. All right. That's okay.
Your hands are all wet.
Jesus!
Jesus Christ!
Come here, come here, come here.
Hold on. Hold on.
Nice and tight.
Hi. Did you just call me?
I was in the shower. I heard the phone.
I thought it was you.
So, how are you?
Did you have a good day?
Yeah, yeah.
Really? That's terrific.
That's really terrific.
You sound excited.
Yeah.
No, I'm not against the idea, I mean...
Don't get me wrong. It's just the money.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, darling. I love you.
Bye.
Alex?
How are you feeling?
Okay.
I gotta go.
Will you call me sometime?
You don't have to, if you don't want to.
No, I want to.
You promise me you're gonna go see the doctor?
Okay.
Good bye.
Good bye.
- You take care.
- You, too.
Shit.
Look what I got.
Look what I got for you here.
A little spaghetti and meat sauce.
That's it, buddy.
We'll make an Italian out of you yet.
That's a good boy. Good dog.
Have a good one, yeah.
What are you doing here? It's 8:00 a.m.
I'm in the shitter, Martha. Got to be in court by 2:00 and I'm really behind.
Will you do me a favor?
Cancel everything.
Then call Drimmer, tell him we're fine.
- I'll be there by 2:00.
- At 2:00? Okay.
Good morning, Martha.
- Daddy!
- Hey! Honey! Oh, God, I missed you.
- We had a great time!
- Yeah?
- I went for a walk with Grandpa...
- You did?
...and we saw rabbits and chased them...
Well, good. Why don't you slow down?
I can't understand one word you're saying.
- Daddy, I want a rabbit.
- I know you do, honey.
- Hi, darling. How are you?
- Good.
Good.
God, I missed you.
- Liar.
- I did.
Well, I should go away more often.
- I did this one.
- You did?
- Yes. Pick another one.
- I thought it was this row you picked.
- No. It was this one.
- I think you're in a lot of trouble.
- Okay.
- Now, pick a card, Dad.
Any card at all?
- Yeah? Where'd you learn this?
- Of course.
- Grandpa showed me.
- Oh.
Surprise.
So how was it?
Oh, come on, I'm a big boy. I can take it.
It had a place for rabbits.
Oh, no! She said it.
She said the R-word. Oh, no!
Not rabbits? Rabbits?
Rabbits!
- Rabbits!
- Not rabbits?
Rabbits!
Well, what can I tell you?
It's absolutely perfect.
- In this row?
- No.
So, when are you gonna come up and take a look at it?
- Just for the hell of it?
- In this row?
How about tomorrow morning?
- Daddy, which row?
- You mean it?
If you get me back to the office by 1:00, yeah.
Which row, Dad?
It's in this row, sweetheart.
Oh, I love this.
Dan?
Honey? Honey, come here.
I want you to see this.
Well?
It's... It's okay. It's okay.
- Come on, it's fantastic!
- It's great. It's great.
Just think of all the money we're gonna save, not living in New York.
The local high school is excellent.
My own children went there.
- You see?
- This is a terrific area for kids.
Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure.
Is it okay if I go upstairs?
Please, go right ahead.
I'll wait for you down here.
Thank you.
You know, we still got to decorate.
We can fix up anything.
We can have painting parties.
Painting parties?
Beth, you're making me very nervous.
Well, now, look at this. This is fantastic.
This would make a terrific playroom.
What are you talking about, playroom?
This is my den!
It's a den!
I knew you were going to like it.
I like it.
I'll be in court. How you doing, Dan?
- Hi, Eunice. Martha back from lunch?
- Good afternoon, Mr. Gallagher.
- She just returned.
- Thank you.
Hi.
Hello.
This isn't a bad time, is it?
I was in the area. I figured that...
No, no.
You want to come into my office?
This is his account?
Hey, Danny. Danny, you gonna be in your office a little later this...
- Excuse me? Have we met somewhere?
- I don't think so.
She looked at me first.
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
I was going to call you today.
I... This is terribly embarrassing.
I just wanted to say sorry for what happened.
I had no right to put you through all that.
Nothing happened, okay?
I was going through a bad time.
And everything was coming to a crisis, and...
But I'm fine. I'm really all right.
And thank you.
- You don't have to thank me.
- Oh, yeah, I do.
A lot of guys would have just run away.
I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't been there.
Well, you look good.
As a matter of fact, you look great.
Thanks.
So that's past?
Yeah.
- May I ask you one more favor?
- What's that?
I've got two tickets to Madame Butterfly, two weeks from Thursday.
I'd really love it if you'd come with me, kind of as a peace offering.
Well, that's very nice of you.
But I don't think it's a good idea.
- No strings attached.
- Alex.
I know, you don't have to explain.
I just thought I'd ask.
So...
I'll see you around sometime.
Okay.
Come here.
- Take care.
- Yeah. Good bye.
Good bye.
All right. Come on, let's go, pal.
We're on a roll. We're on a roll.
- Let's see that action.
- Down the middle.
I like it. Very nice.
That is no good. I'm depressed.
What about
Rodgers v. whatchamacallit?
- Winitsky.
- Right.
I got your memo. You're going to go for summary judgment?
Why not, Arthur?
I mean, the facts are not in dispute.
Rodgers admits reading Winitsky's article.
The question is whether he plagiarized it in his book.
As you know, you can't copyright an idea, only the expression of the idea, and Rodgers sure as hell didn't use any of the words in the book.
- Let me think about it.
- Okay.
So I hear you're about to become a suburbanite.
Yeah, we're gonna take the big plunge.
- Got a buyer for the apartment?
- No.
- Got cold sweats about your escrow?
- Yeah.
But not about Rodgers vs. Winitsky?
- No, sir.
- Good.
He's still in a meeting.
Yes, I know.
I did expect him to be through by now.
I'd like you to have lunch with me on Tuesday, if you're around.
Well, thank you, Arthur, that'd be great.
Let me just check my diary.
You are on his list of calls.
It's Alex Forrest.
Again? I thought you told her
I'd call her back.
- I did.
- All right. Put her on hold.
Would you mind holding?
He'll be free in a moment.
Tuesday would be great, Arthur.
- I look forward to it.
- Thank you. I will, too.
Put her through.
Hello?
Look, Alex, I thought we agreed this was not a good idea.
Why?
Look, I'm sorry.
I thought you understood.
If I've misled you in some way,
I apologize.
But I don't think it's a good idea if we talk to each other anymore.
Okay?
Good bye.
Yeah, if she calls again, tell her I'm not here. Thank you.
Wait, let me just...
Let me just look at you.
You're so beautiful.
Just so beautiful.
- Wouldn't you know?
- I know.
Open it, will you? That's my wife!
I wouldn't do it to my wife.
You know what? It's okay.
You don't know how many injuries can happen?
- It's my wife he's doing it...
- Jimmy, don't terrorize them!
I'm a lawyer, I'm insured.
Oh, it's excited.
Now, don't forget who gave you this, all right?
My cold sores are almost gone.
This is for you.
Ladies first. I use that term advisedly.
You're the best.
That's my wife! All right, ladies...
A little attention, please, ladies.
Gentlemen, my wife, ball and chain.
Mother of some of my children.
- I wouldn't be that confident about it.
- Absolutely.
Here is to Miller, Goodman,
Hurst and Gallagher!
- And to Mrs. Gallagher.
- Give me a break, will you, guys?
All he did is ask me to lunch, you know?
Yeah, and you're moving to your country estate.
You'll forget you never knew us plebs.
Oh, no, wait a minute.
I read one of those self-help books.
Published by Robbins & Hart, of course.
Of course. Samurai Self-Help.
In it, it tells you how to deal with the anxieties of your friends as you move up the corporate ladder and they stay put, or God forbid, go down.
And in this book, it tells you not to coddle your friends' anxieties.
So, I'm not gonna make any false reassurances, guys.
I'm not gonna tell you you're gonna be at the house every weekend.
I mean, let's face it.
Things have changed.
This is not a classless society.
As a matter of fact, this is it, guys.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
I knew he was gonna say that!
At least the man is running true to form.
Honey, I think we got to make a clean break.
I mean, we're on a roll. We got to travel light. You know, let's face it.
- Travel light. Exactly.
- Absolutely.
Thanks for the time you've given us in your lives.
Here you, drink.
I want you with a lampshade on your head by 10:00.
Why should today be any different, you know what I mean?
Hello? Hello?
Here's to you.
Cheers.
Hello?
Hello!
Yeah?
Yeah, Richards. It's kind of late, isn't it?
If you refuse to take my phone calls at the office, you leave me no choice.
It's 2:00 in the morning here.
Can't this wait till tomorrow morning?
Oh, is it awkward for you to talk?
You could say that, yeah.
I've got to see you.
I don't have the documentation to answer that question right now, but I'll call you from the office.
No. Meet me in front of the
Robbins & Hart building tomorrow. 6:00.
Don't disappoint me. Be there.
Okay.
This has got to stop.
Dan, if you'd agreed to see me,
I wouldn't have called you.
Do you get it, all right? It's over.
There is nothing between us.
You've mean you've had your fun, now you just want a quiet life.
- Why are you doing this?
- Doing what?
You need help.
- Don't tell me what I need.
- You need a shrink.
Why are you so hostile?
I'm not your enemy.
Yeah, then why are you trying to hurt me?
I'm not trying to hurt you, Dan.
I love you.
- You what?
- I love you.
- You don't even know me.
- Oh, how can you say that?
Alex, we spent a weekend together, that's all.
You spent that second night.
You must like me a little.
Because I was concerned about you.
Jesus Christ!
Why do you read so much into everything?
I mean, can't you understand?
I have a whole relationship with someone else.
- I am very happy.
- Whole means complete.
If your life's so damn complete, what were you doing with me?
Is this what you want to talk about, our imaginary love affair?
I'm pregnant.
I saw my gynecologist on Monday.
Here's his card. You can call him.
You don't...
Use anything? No.
I had a very bad miscarriage last year.
I didn't think I could get pregnant.
And how do you know it's mine?
Because I don't sleep around.
I apologize.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Don't worry, all right? You're not going to have to handle this alone.
Handle what?
The abortion. I'll take care of it.
I'll pay for it.
What makes you think
I want an abortion?
- You're not going to have the baby?
- Why not?
There are plenty of one-parent families.
- At least they don't end in divorce.
- I don't have a say in this?
I want this child.
It has nothing to do with you.
I want it whether you're going to be a part of it or not.
Then why are you telling me? Why?
Why not just go ahead and do it?
I was hoping that you would want to be a part of it.
This is crazy. This is totally insane.
I'm 36 years old. It may be my last chance to have a child.
Alex...
Just think what you're saying.
Just think about it.
We are going to live with this for the rest of our lives.
I know that.
I've thought of that. I know how you feel.
It's a big thing.
But it doesn't have to be a problem.
Really, it doesn't.
You play fair with me,
I'll play fair with you.
"He led Agnes and Nellie into the hall closet and shut the door.
"Agnes and Nellie and Oink giggled and laughed in the dark.
"Pearl listened outside the door.
'Oh, it works, ' cried Nellie.
"'Of course, ' said Oink.
'Look at the flying dog!' yelled Agnes.
"'WOW, ' cried Nellie.
"Pearl frowned. 'Who cares about flying dogs?' she said.
"Nobody heard her.
"'Look out for the worms!' squealed Agnes.
"'Eek!' yelled Nellie and Agnes together.
"'Look at the monster cockroach!' yelled Oink. 'Ick! Help!"'
So, you know what I did? Right.
I call the doctor.
And you know what he says?
"Congratulations!"
I can't even imagine what she told him.
Anyway, that's not the end of it.
So, after I talked to the doctor, this morning, I broke into her apartment.
I know.
Me, a lawyer, breaking and entering.
I don't know, I'm looking for something, anything to get a handle on what I'm dealing with here.
I thought maybe if I can find out she was sleeping with somebody else, you know.
I didn't find anything.
Anyway, I didn't find anything.
Jimmy, I don't know. I don't know anything about family law, okay?
So you gotta help me now.
What kind of case does she really have?
Well, it ain't good.
She keeps calling the apartment.
Every time Beth answers the phone, she hangs up.
I'm scared, Jimmy. I...
I don't want to lose my family.
The facts as alleged are horrendous.
The instrument allegedly used in all three cases
was an electronic shock device,
or stun gun, now standard issue for New York City police.
The stun guns, which jolt and incapacitate the body
by interrupting electrical waves to the muscles,
are being used or experimented with by 500 police agencies
across the country,
marketed as an alternative to the nightsticks.
Operator, may I help you?
Operator, I've been trying to get 555-812-9212.
The recording says it's been disconnected.
Just a moment, please.
I'm sorry. The number's been changed to an unlisted number.
Operator, this is a real emergency.
Please, you need to give me that number.
I'm sorry, we're not allowed to give out that information.
- Well, fuck you!
- Oh, my place or yours?
- I like it. I like it a lot.
- Well, we've been very happy here.
I'd definitely like to think about it if I could.
- ...to clean and all?
- Yes.
I have a lady that comes in a couple times a week, as a matter of fact.
And I can certainly give you her name as well.
Oh, I'd love that.
And I have babysitters galore.
The whole works.
Whatever information you would need.
Hi, darling. Darling, this is Alex.
I'm sorry, I've forgotten your last name.
- Alex Forrest.
- Alex Forrest, this is my husband Dan.
Hi. Glad to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
- Haven't we met somewhere before?
- I don't think so. No.
No, we have. Weren't you at that party at the Japanese place, a few weeks ago?
Honey, the exercise book.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
You're a lawyer?
And you work for the firm of...
What's the name?
Well, anyway...
We've definitely met.
- Well, you have a good memory.
- I never forget a face.
- It's a small world.
- It certainly is.
So, I gather you're going to the country?
- Moving to the country?
- Yes.
Have you found a place yet?
Actually, we found a place in Bedford.
Do you know it up there?
- Oh, it's beautiful.
- Yes.
So I guess you'll be moving out of here almost immediately?
Actually, we wanted to do some remodeling first.
I guess you're looking for a place right away, aren't you?
Well, yeah. I'd kind of like to settle in.
Alex is expecting a baby.
Oh, that's...
Will you excuse me?
I have some work I've got to do.
Oh, I better run, too.
Thank you for the tea and showing me the apartment.
- You're very welcome.
- I like it. I really like it.
- We've been very happy here.
- I'd like to think about it if I could.
Let me give you our number so you can call us direct.
Thank you.
- I'll keep in touch.
- Great.
- Bye-bye.
- Good bye.
She seemed really interested.
It's funny, she didn't mention a husband.
I get the feeling that she's on her own.
- What is it? You seem down.
- No, no. I'm just tired.
- Hello?
- Yeah, hi, it's me.
Who?
You know damn well who it is, okay?
Now, come on. Let me in. I want to talk.
Oh, so now you want to talk?
So, what can I get you?
I've got Scotch, I've got vodka, there's a nice Chablis...
Cut the shit, will you? Just cut it!
I don't know what you're up to, but I'm going to tell you it's going to stop right now.
No, it's not going to stop.
It's going to go on and on, until you face up to your responsibilities.
What responsibilities?
I'm pregnant.
I'm going to have our child.
Alex, that's your choice, honey, that has nothing to do with me.
I just want to be a part of your life.
Oh, this is the way you do it, huh?
Showing up at my apartment?
Well, what am I supposed to do?
You won't answer my calls.
You change your number. I mean...
I'm not going to be ignored, Dan.
You don't get it.
You just... You don't get it.
Don't you remember our weekend?
Wasn't that wonderful?
Why can't we just be like that again?
I know you feel it, too.
I mean, what are you so afraid of?
Hey, just don't flatter yourself, Alex.
Go ahead, hit me. If you can't fuck me, why don't you just hit me?
You're so sad. You know that, Alex?
Lonely and very sad.
Don't you ever pity me, you smug bastard.
I'll pity you.
I'll pity you because you're sick.
Why? Because I won't allow you to treat me like some slut you can just bang a couple of times and throw in the garbage?
I'm going to be the mother of your child.
I want a little respect.
You want respect?
- Respect.
- What are you doing?
Please, Dan. Please don't go.
I didn't mean it. Please, I'm sorry.
I'll tell your wife.
You tell my wife, I'll kill you.
It only takes a phone call!
Hello? Hello?
Got it.
Guys, that's on the second door on the left of the landing.
Thank you.
Honey, you could've stayed in the apartment.
Dan was in such a hurry to get out of New York.
Momma, that's you, isn't it? Look.
Oh, Lord, put it away.
All right, easy on that door frame.
Good. Right. Nice. Just like a glove.
I got it. Sorry. I got it.
Hello?
Martha.
Martha. It's Martha.
Hello?
Hi, honey. How you doing?
Did the plumber come yet?
Oh, did he ever.
Well, I don't really want to know about it, all right?
Hey, guess what I'm looking at.
- You got it?
- Yeah, yeah, I got it right here.
Or, I should say, I got her.
What's she like?
Well, she's cute. She looks like a rabbit.
I mean, she's white, she's got long ears, little pink eyes.
- Soft.
- She sounds cute.
Yeah. Ellen doesn't know anything about it?
No. She doesn't think she's going to get one.
See what happens if you work here too long, Eunice?
- Isn't he cute?
- Thank you.
Oh, I forgot. This arrived for you.
- Good night, Eunice.
- Good night, Mr. Gallagher.
And it's an inbound to Ewing on top.
Patrick gives it back to Gerald.
Gerald on the right to Sparrow.
Goes base line, comes to the reverse side,
gives it off to Ewing.
He spins, knocks the man away, throws the ball. Shot is good.
Hey, Joaquin!
Holton on the outside.
Holding down a left-handed dribble against Sparrow.
Now looking inside, looking in.
Finds no one...
Jesus fucking Christ!
Fucking bitch! Jesus Christ!
No. No. It had something to do with the electrical system.
The whole goddamn thing blew up.
It was smoking.
All right, honey.
I'll see you in a little while.
Mr. Gallagher?
You forgot your contract.
Thanks.
Hello, Dan. Are you surprised?
This is what you've reduced me to.
I guess you thought you'd get away with it. Well, you can't.
Because part of you is growing inside of me, and that's a fact, Dan,
and you'd better start learning how to deal with it.
Because, you know, I feel you.
I taste you.
I think you.
I touch you.
Can you understand? Can you?
I'm just asking you to acknowledge your responsibilities.
I mean, is that so bad?
I don't think so.
I don't think it's unreasonable.
And, you know, another thing is
that you thought that you could just walk into my life
and turn it upside down, without a thought for anyone but yourself.
You know what you are, Dan?
You're a cock-sucking son of a bitch.
I hate you.
I bet you don't even like girls, do you?
You flaming fucking faggot!
Daddy! Thank you.
You're welcome, honey.
Do you like her?
A bunny!
You like it?
You thought you could just walk into my life and turn it upside down,
without a thought for anyone but yourself.
You know what you are, Dan?
You're a cock-sucking son of a bitch.
You are.
I bet you don't even like girls, do you?
They probably scare you. I know I do.
So you're scared of me, aren't you?
You're fucking frightened of me.
You're afraid.
You're afraid, aren't you?
You gutless, heartless, spineless, fucking son of a bitch.
I hate you.
You deserve everything you get.
- Jesus Christ!
- Sorry.
I was wondering what you were doing up so late.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
No, it's okay.
I was listening to a deposition.
I couldn't sleep.
Come on.
I'm going to give you a back rub.
- Back rub?
- Brandy, a back rub.
- You won't know what hit you.
- Sounds good.
My client wants it stopped.
He just wants an end to the harassment.
He's positive it was this woman who trashed the car?
Yes. Yes, of course.
- Any witnesses?
- No.
Welcome to file a complaint if it'd make him feel better.
I mean, there's not a lot you can do without proof.
Look, Lieutenant, this woman is completely irrational.
There's no telling what she could do.
We can't go around arresting people for what they might do. You know that.
I'm not asking you to arrest her.
I... He simply...
He wants her warned.
Well, we could talk to her.
It may make things public.
He's not going to like that.
It may even aggravate the situation with the girl.
How's that?
Well, whatever resentment she's feeling, she's probably got it out of her system.
And any action we take could provoke her.
What if she didn't get it out of her system? What then?
You have to catch her in the act.
Then we can bring charges.
Well, you say he just has to sit there and take it?
It's his bed.
I'm afraid he's going to have to lie in it.
Come on. Come on in, come on in.
Come on, Ellen, we're going to Grandma's.
Grandma's? Let's go.
Come on, Quince.
Quincy, come on, hurry up.
Come on, get on in. Hurry up.
Watch his tail, sweetie.
Make him sit down.
- See you didn't get your car back.
- No, it's a total write-off.
- The electrical system's just shot.
- Extraordinary, those foreign cars.
- There you are, dear.
- Thank you.
- Want to try it again, sweetie?
- Okay.
Okay.
So?
Dear Priscilla, Miles asked me to ask you to marry him.
Very good.
- You want to do it one more time.
- Okay.
Do it with your hat and do the bow, so when you actually do it, you know what you're doing.
- Let me see your bow.
- Okay.
And, what do you say?
Dear Priscilla, Miles asked me to ask you to marry him.
- Very good. You got that.
- Ellen. Ellen.
Come here.
- That was good.
- Thank you.
That was really good.
That was so good.
- I love you.
- I love you, too.
Thank you, darling.
Come on, Quincy.
- Daddy!
- What?
Whitey's gone!
Dan!
Whitey's gone!
It's all right, darling.
It's going to be okay, sweetie.
You should try and get some sleep.
- Is she okay?
- She's asleep.
- Did you call the police?
- Not yet, no.
Why not?
Honey, we've got to talk.
What is it?
I know who did this.
You do? Who?
Remember the girl who came to the apartment?
The one I met in the Japanese restaurant?
The one with the blonde hair.
You're scaring me.
What is it?
Did you have an affair with her?
Yes.
Beth?
Beth, I am so sorry.
The last thing I ever wanted to do was to hurt you.
Are you...
Are you in love with her?
No, no. It was one night.
It didn't mean anything.
What has it got to do with what's happened?
She's pregnant.
She's...
It's yours?
I don't know. That's what she says.
Honey, listen to me. Beth, please.
Get out! I want you out of here.
I want you out of this house!
And I want you out now.
How could you do that? I hate you!
Understand what I'm saying, honey.
I don't want to hear it!
I don't want to hear any of it!
Please, just listen to me, will you, Beth?
Please. Listen to me.
What is the matter with you?
Dan, what a pleasant surprise.
It's over, Alex. It's all finished.
I told Beth, she knows all about it.
Sure. You haven't got the balls.
Why don't you speak to her?
Why would I want to talk to her?
This is Beth Gallagher.
If you ever come near my family again,
I'll kill you, you understand?
That's the last one, Ellen. I mean it.
Hello? Hi, Daddy.
When are you coming home?
Honey, I don't know.
How are you doing?
Good.
Okay.
Yeah.
Grandpa taught me a new card trick.
Oh, did he?
What, the one with the jacks?
No, the one with the kings.
Good.
I won't.
Good.
How's Mommy?
Send her my love.
Okay. Goodbye.
Daddy?
Call me tomorrow.
I will. I promise.
You be sure you tell Mommy I called.
I will.
Love you a lot, too. Bye-bye.
BYE-bye.
Hi, Mrs. Gallagher.
Did you forget something?
I came to get Ellen.
Ellen? Why, I thought you picked her up already.
Well, I'm sure she's left already.
Betty?
Is Ellen in here with you?
- She's gone home already.
- Are you sure?
I'm positive. She's not inside and she's not in the playground.
- I thought you picked her up.
- Who did pick her up?
Well, don't worry.
She can't have gone far.
- You don't understand.
- I'll check her locker.
- Alicia, where's Ellen?
- She's gone.
Call the police.
Ellen.
Please, let her be all right.
Christ.
Where are you?
Ellen! Ellen!
Ellen!
Ellen!
Look out!
Where are you?
- Bye-bye, Ellen.
- Bye.
Ellen, can I have a kiss?
- Bye.
- Bye.
Excuse me, I'm looking for a patient named Gallagher. I'm her husband.
Room 22 at the end of the corridor.
- Is she going to be okay?
- Yeah, she'll be fine.
She was very lucky. It might have been a lot worse. A lot worse.
- Daddy!
- Hi, baby. Oh, God, I missed you.
I missed you, honey.
Are you okay?
Have you seen Mommy yet?
Yeah.
Okay, you stay here with Granny.
I'm going to go see Mommy.
Howard.
You'll be okay.
- You guys want to go to Ziggy's first?
- Yeah!
- It's a hot place.
- That's a good idea.
All right! You know...
I came in here before.
I tried to explain the situation to you, you didn't want to listen to me.
Now, the woman took my kid and that's kidnapping, right? Am I right?
My wife's in the hospital.
She could've been killed!
If you're not going to do something about...
Take it easy, okay.
You don't have to shout.
Okay.
Okay. What are you going to do?
We'll tell New York to pick her up and bring her in for questioning, okay?
Okay.
Okay, then I'm...
I'm going to go to the hospital tomorrow, pick my wife up and hopefully,
I'll be home for the weekend if you need to talk to me.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
You're welcome.
How's that feel?
Good and warm? Good.
Are you all cozy?
Is Mommy going to be all right?
Mommy's going to be fine, honey.
She's going to be fine.
Are you going to stay with us?
I'm going to stay with you, honey.
Now, you go to sleep, okay?
Good night, doll.
Forever?
I promise, honey.
You mean the detectives in Manhattan have no idea where she's gone?
They don't know where she is?
Yeah.
No, I see. I see.
All right.
If you get anymore information, you'll be sure and let me know, won't you, Lieutenant?
Thank you very much. Good night.
I think we just found out where the beef is.
Okay. Cathy and Charlie, who do you think held out for the most money?
The one who has to try out the mysterious new shampoo,
or the man who has to try on the sundress.
And remember, it's possible that one of them...
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
How does the arm feel?
It hurts.
Get you some more painkillers.
Okay.
Welcome back. Our contestants have been asked to decide...
Thanks.
Now, you just holler if you need anything else, all right?
I'd love a cup of tea.
You got it.
What are you doing here?
Why are you here?
He tried to say goodbye to me last night.
But he couldn't, because he and I feel the same way about each other.
Do you know how it is when you meet somebody for the first time and you get this instant attraction?
And don't you think I understand what you're doing?
You're trying to move him into the country.
And you're keeping him away from me.
And you're playing happy family.
But you wouldn't understand that because you're so selfish.
And he told me about you.
He told me about you.
He was very honest.
If you weren't so stupid, you'd know that.
But you're so stupid.
You're just so stupid, you're a stupid, selfish bitch!
You're a stupid, selfish bitch!
Dan!
Dan! Dan!
Dan!
Dan!
Dan!
No!
Stop!
This is Dinky Dau
Doug on All-Hits AFVN Radio Saigon.
You just heard the Left Banke
singing all about their "Pretty Ballerina."
Coming up right after the news,
we got a dedication going out...
... to all you guys pulling guard duty
tonight at Quan Loi.
A little something to keep you awake.
We'll be back with more music
in a minute.
This is Channel 54, Saigon.
Time at the automatic tone,
2200 hours.
The landing zone occupied by elements...
... of the 1st Infantry Division
at Quan Loi...
... 65 miles north of Saigon...
... received about five rounds
of 107 mm rocket fire.
And an element of...
And we're back with
the hits on AFVN, Channel 54, Saigon.
This is Army Specialist First Class
Doug Ledhart with the music tonight...
... and here's Wilson Pickett
with "Funky Broadway."
Criminal Investigations Detachment.
This is it. This is my life.
The path of my life has led me to be a fucking cop...
...in the fucking cesspool of the world.
I'd say we just give up on the motherfucker.
This man's service record says he's a tunnel rat.
For nine months
I've wanted to meet a rat.
Well, I hope you meet one.
- What's the next name on the list?
- Just head over to the Moo-Lon.
I gotta meet my rat.
Yeah, yeah.
This guy here?
Yeah, this dude dinky dau number 10.
Crazy motherfuck.
- He was here?
- Yeah. One hour.
Crazy motherfuck.
Buy cigarette from Plowboy.
Smoking and smoking it.
Fall down.
Get up. Leave.
There. There's Plowboy.
The fucker can run. Out!
No fucking shit.
Motherfucker.
Cut him off!
Slow down, you little fuck!
Stand tall, you little fuck!
Why you chase?
I don't know why you deal drugs,
Plowboy.
You could have made this shithole's Olympic team...
...won some medals and retired to a palace somewhere.
I no deal. Plowboy farmer.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Must be a fucking pill farmer.
This man. Where is he?
- I don't know. Never see.
- "Never see"? You're full of shit.
- I'm gonna pull your fucking nuts off.
- Hey, easy, Babe.
- Easy? He pull a gun on you?
- Yeah.
- He could've shot you.
- Yeah.
Stand the motherfuck up.
Let me go.
- I'm taking them off.
- Hey, hey, easy, Babe.
Remember the last time you did that to a national?
All those reports?
- It ain't worth the paperwork.
- I don't give a shit about paperwork.
I want them nuts. I'm gonna throw them in the fucking sewer.
Think about it. Here I come.
I'm gonna take them...
I can't control him, Plowboy.
You better talk to me.
You better talk to me.
Now, do it, Baby. That's it!
Shit.
We got mice.
The meeting of hearts and minds continues, I see.
Don't give me any shit, Lime.
He pulled a gun on me.
Vietnamese nationals are outside your jurisdiction.
Well, we're looking for a deserter who is in our jurisdiction...
...and your cousin here sold him a laced stick about an hour ago...
...and might know where he is.
Pull his fucking nuts off.
Maybe I should file a protest to the commanding officer.
So you can spend the rest of the tours in the Long Binh stockade.
We gotta talk to him, Lime.
You're welcome to observe if you like.
You allow me that right?
How conveniently you Americans forget that Vietnam is not your colony.
He's at the Kit Kat Club.
Lime, if I was a different kind of guy...
...I'd ask you to marry me.
I simply can't wait.
A- Spot 1, this is Landlord.
A- Spot 1, over.
- Where you guys been?
Top wants you over at an apartment
on Vam Co Dong and Minh Streets.
No can do, Landlord.
We're heading over to the Kit Kat to pop a deserter...
...we've been after for three days.
Send somebody else.
Top just got off the horn with the mice
and he sounded pissed.
Oh, shit.
Shh, shh, shh. Yeah, come here.
Come on.
It didn't take you too long.
Where you been, pissing off more MPs?
You heard about that, huh?
You two can be a couple of real jerk-offs, you know that? I mean, tact.
- Who's your friend?
- Oh, it's a dead woman's kid.
Go away.
You're fucked up, man.
- Get the fuck out of my way.
What you doing?
You'll be seeing me, motherfucker.
Hey, why so glum, Al?
Hey, Top, don't call me Al.
My mama named me Albaby.
A- L-B-A-B-Y.
In respect to her, please.
Looks like a Vietnamese problem.
What are we doing here?
Yeah, it was, until somebody found this.
Oh, great.
American. Officer.
Found it in her hand. She's a hooker.
.45, the back of the head and bang-o.
Anything else?
Not much.
Her name was "Nguyen Tao Giap."
Apparently she's new to the area.
Nobody in the building knows her.
Hey, Top. Let me do that.
Let me do that because I got 13 brothers and sisters.
Yeah.
A neighbor woman here heard the shot.
She's got something to say.
- Where's she now?
- Talking to the mice.
Oh, Colonel Kitts says to coordinate our investigation with theirs, by the way.
In the interest of better ally relations.
Who's heading up the investigation for the mice?
Looks like the American's capacity to enjoy himself has gotten excessive again.
- Nothing's been established yet, Lime.
It will be.
I'm sure you'll do everything to prove it's not an American who did this.
- You're really starting to pain me, Lime.
- Oh, excusez-moi.
Lime Green.
Ain't that the color of puke?
Sergeant.
The neighbor's ready for questioning.
Appears she was with a black GI who went next door when he heard the shot.
He didn't come back, but a couple minutes later...
...she saw him leave the building following somebody.
She thinks it was the killer.
Ask her if she knows the GI's name or his unit.
Drippy dick.
No name, no unit, nothing. He was only with her for a couple minutes.
Her short-arm inspection revealed he had the clap.
Drippy dick.
Yeah, she says he had a real dose.
Tell her to meet me at VD Control tomorrow at noon.
No. Me got no VD. I'm very clean.
I'm number one blowjob girl.
Xin loi, miss.
I'm sure you're as clean as a whistle.
Just tell her to meet me.
And, Rogers, no freebies, okay?
Do you know this girl?
Do you know this girl?
Have you seen this girl?
Do you know this...? Oh, fuck it.
Yeah, right. Nobody knows a thing.
But somebody's got some American scrip in their pocket.
I'll tell you something, man.
Bullshit and science rule the world.
Where did she come from?
Dubuque.
Stockholm.
She ain't from here.
You know, that insignia could be total bullshit.
Yeah.
You know who our suspects are?
- Everybody in Saigon.
- Civilians, troops, gangsters, cowboys...
...deserters, refugees, dopers, black-marketeers.
God...
...I love this town.
I really do.
I'm starting to wonder about you, my man.
My name is Agent Perkins.
This here's my partner, Agent McGriff.
Now, you men are here...
...for two reasons.
One, is because you're black, which there ain't no question about.
And two...
...is because you've all recently been treated for drippy dick.
Dick just dripping.
Shit, I can hear your dicks dripping.
How does it feel?
Black in Nam.
Fucking dick feels like it's about to drop off.
Boy, y'all some sorry motherfuckers.
We have reason to believe that one of you... One of you...
...was in the off-limits soul-kitchen section...
...of Vam Co Dong Street last night when a shooting occurred.
Now, one of you was there.
We'd like to talk to you about what you may have seen or heard.
No volunteers?
All right. Stand up and line up against that motherfucking wall back there.
- Get on up.
- I'll get the girl.
Drippy dick.
Shit.
I don't know why the bitch is telling fibs.
She ain't got no reason to tell fibs.
Bullshit.
I been there all night fucking that bitch.
She should be grateful, all that love.
How many times did you fuck her, Maurice?
Eight, 10 times.
I'm a ho-taming motherfucker.
That bitch won't work for a week at least.
Bullshit.
She don't have the clap, Maurice, and you can't piss without a painkiller.
I'm gonna put your ass in LBJ.
I'm sick of this shit.
Hey, then be sick of it, motherfucker.
The only thing I saw last night was some slant-eyed pussy.
Okay. All aright, all right, all right.
Calm down.
Let me talk to Maurice here.
Oh, shit. What you want, Rochester?
I don't wanna be Rochester.
Maurice, you seem to be overlooking what fine shape you're in here.
You think I ain't hip to that?
I got my own plan for working this.
Yeah? What plan is that?
I'm working on it.
And no way does it involve you two low-rank bohunk motherfuckers.
Who does it involve, Maurice?
A general.
A general.
I want a dude with some jizz to shelter my ass.
I wanna see a dude with some jizz to cut me orders out of here.
Now, you want a piece of this?
You fetch my ass a general.
How are we gonna get you a general...
...if we don't know what you have to tell him?
I followed the dude that wasted the bitch.
Now, I know what he looks like.
I know what's his rank and I know where's his billet.
But we talking here, high-ranking scrambled eggs motherfucker.
I know not to mess with no dude with that kind of juice.
Not in this man's army.
So if you motherfuckers want a piece of this...
...fetch me a dude with stars on his shirt.
Was the man you followed an Army officer?
General Reynolds is in Da Nang until Monday.
Hey, that's cool.
That's cool. I'll wait.
But I ain't going back to my unit.
How's that?
I want a weapon...
...and I wanna stay in a safe house, off-campus.
Somewhere downtown in the soul kitchen.
I don't trust no motherfuckers at this point.
Now, don't give me what I want...
...and I'll get total motherfucking amnesia, dig?
I seen that shit on Mod Squad, understand?
You get that shit and you don't remember nothing.
Those are my terms.
Nonnegotiable, power to the people.
Fuck the people. Power to Maurice.
I'm not staying with the fool because I'll wind up killing him.
- Mr. Rogers.
- Mr. Rogers.
Hey, man. Why don't we get us some dope delivered up here?
Man, you nervous enough without that stuff.
Then let's get some bitches up here and have a party.
I doubt the VD Control would approve you, Maurice.
Shit.
You know, you sure is one square motherfucker.
McGriff and Perkins gonna drop off some food for us in a little while.
Maybe they'll party with you.
Yeah, right.
Those two bohunk motherfuckers.
Hey. Now, that's happening.
Hi, everybody.
I'm Archie Bell with the Drells
of Houston, Texas.
- We don 't only sing...
Oh, watch this shit here.
... we dance just as good as we walk.
In Houston, we just started
a new dance called the Tighten Up.
This is the mu...
They're coming to waste my ass.
Man, would you put that thing away?
The power goes out all the time down here.
Come on, motherfuckers.
Come on and get me.
Phone's dead too.
I can't take this spook house shit at all.
Shh! Be quiet.
Sergeant McGriff?
Perkins?
Biggest fucking game of the year,
Alcindor versus Hayes...
...and I can't get it on AFVN.
Holy shit.
- Are you all right, man?
- Yeah.
- Oh, shit.
I think it was the sappers.
They sprayed us with...
Hold it right there, motherfucker.
- Sure you're all right?
- Yeah. Go ahead.
Just call the medics, man. I'm all right.
Do you see him?
I can't tell.
Are they up there?
- Which way? Which way, goddamn it?
- I don't know.
There they are. Hit it. Hit it.
Look out! Get out of the way!
- Don't do it!
Cocksuckers!
Goddamn insect motherfuckers. Shit.
Okay, slight disorientation here.
Just have him go inside and if he needs an analgesic, give it to him.
But if not, keep him off morphine.
This guy goes to OR 1.
What's the status in OR 1?
- How's he doing?
- They won't let you in there.
Some VC asshole threw a satchel bomb in a movie theater up in Chau Long.
- They're kind of busy.
- We shouldn't have left him.
Concussion wound.
You couldn't have known.
I'm gonna go see how he's doing.
What a fucking mess.
You, out of here.
- Yeah, yeah.
He okay?
Did you get a look at his assailants?
Did you get to look at them?
Yeah.
They were slopes.
Gooks.
Little tiny slant-eyed VC motherfuckers with Hawaiian shirts.
Somehow I find it hard to feel sorry for you losing one friend...
...when hundreds of Vietnamese are dying each day.
But then I suppose American is a study in self-possession.
I should remember that.
I could pop your head like a pimple before they get off a single round.
McGriff.
You guys, get out.
Your passion is misdirected, sergeant.
The men who killed your friend work for the same people you do.
That's an order.
I found out what that was all about in there.
Lime says CID had this case before and suddenly dropped it.
He says there's been six of these murders...
...and there's someone high up on our side covering them up.
Man, that is such bullshit.
You know, that's typical
South Vietnamese paranoid bullshit.
If there was an investigation before...
...it would've been in our files and it wasn't.
Well, he also said those two guys you chased were not VC.
He says they're working for the same folks we're working for.
That's crazy.
Rogers gets put in for a Purple Heart just like everybody else in there.
Go home and get some rest.
Both of you.
Hey.
I'm glad it didn't get any worse in there.
I'm not.
We'd have done all right.
Right back to square fucking one.
Hey, you.
Dead girl baby no mine.
You take orphanage.
Take Sacré Coeur.
- No mine. Fuck you.
- Hey. Hey.
Lady.
Goddamn it.
Go away!
Lady, let me in.
I live in a fucking billet.
- Shut the fuck up. It ain't funny.
- It ain't?
You probably got 10 kids of your own scattered all everywhere...
...and now you finally got one you got to take care of.
Just drive to the orphanage, will you?
- Oh! Ah!
- I was hoping that would happen.
I believe this one participated in our night-care program.
Night care, Mother?
Sister Nicole initiated a program to take care of prostitutes' children...
...while their mothers were at work.
Before that, the work was sometimes performed...
...with the child sleeping in the very next bed.
I see.
These murders, they've become almost epidemic.
Mother...
...we're kind of new on this case.
How many murders do you know of?
Six or seven.
Perhaps more.
Did you know this child's mother personally?
No. Sister Nicole may have.
She does social work with many of the prostitutes and bar girls.
Could we speak with Sister Nicole?
If we can find her.
She's always so busy.
These are the six victims we are aware of.
Sergeant?
It's just you look different in your uniform, Sister.
I find that wearing my habit can be quite off-putting to people.
Sometimes I don't wear it when I work in the community.
The common link you are looking for is obvious even in these photographs.
The murdered women's children were all Amerasian.
The mothers worked in the officers' bars mostly, where the money is highest.
This is Dang Kao Lanh.
She was killed almost a year ago.
Her speciality was sadomasochism.
Bondage.
This is Nguyen Chi Diem.
She specialized in oral sex.
The men at the American officers' club would line up for her.
Ngo Van Dinh and her little boy.
December.
She worked for a pimp who put her in the lesbian shows...
...on Vam Co Dong Street...
...and he cheated her every day.
Sergeant?
You're very worldly for a nun, Sister.
I'm trying to help you as much as I can, sergeant.
I was very close to some of these women.
I want to see the killing stopped.
Jesus Christ, officer. Now, what the fuck are we meeting here for?
The dead girl had a picture of herself taken in front of this place.
Where have you been?
It's almost midnight.
I had to go to USARV HQ.
Just got back.
Look.
Victims.
Not one, but seven.
I guess our pal Lime was at least half right.
This shit's been going on for over a year now.
All the victims are between 17 and 22.
And all of them have babies by American daddies.
I know.
Lime may be all the way right.
CID did have this case before.
We dropped it six months ago.
Bang. Like that.
Hey, let's get out of here.
Who's he?
Colonel Kitts. Recognize the name?
You work for him.
Being almost 12:00...
...I like everybody join in welcoming Vietnamese New Year.
Also welcome Tet cease-fire...
...and offer good will, all men.
All men except Charlie.
Five, four, three...
- Goddamn officer class.
...two, one.
Wouldn't surprise me if any one of these pricks is a fucking girl-killer.
They say the investigator that was on it was one of our Marine cousins.
He was transferred out and that was the end of it.
What do you know?
Goddamn fireworks.
Didn't anybody ask any questions?
No.
Hey, so there are a few dead whores.
Haven't you seen a suspect village after an air strike? Men, women, kids. Shit.
Hey, we're in a war zone, girls.
Is the other agent still in country?
Yes, with the 26 Marine,
1 st MarDiv, Khe Sanh.
Jesus Christ.
They transferred him to that shithole.
Weirder.
He's up there at this own request.
What's his story?
His name's Flowers.
Staff Sergeant Elgin Flowers.
Hey, that's all I know.
- We gotta talk to this guy.
- Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, Khe Sanh.
Get your asses shot off.
Hey, Top, it's Tet. We got a cease-fire.
Don't worry about it.
Get down! Incoming!
Keep it low! Keep it low!
- Cease-fire?
This ain't no fucking cease-fire!
Goddamn!
Oh, shit!
Damn. Jesus fucking Christ.
Bullshit.
Motherfucker, you knock over my chow,
I knock over your life.
- Man, fuck you. Shit.
Son of a bitch.
Why don't you save that animosity for Charles out there?
We're looking for Staff Sergeant Elgin Flowers.
Flowers?
He's supposed to be in this bunker.
Now, what you wanna see
Mr. Flowers for?
Flowers' mama don't even wanna see him.
Where's Flowers?
Lieutenant let Flowers dig his own house.
You keep going until you get to the end of this here trench line.
Flowers' house is maybe 20 meters beyond that.
Hey, y'all can't miss it.
Flowers got his mojo working there.
Yeah, get that voodoo shit working.
It's on a stick.
Close the door, motherfucker.
Hey, fuck you, asshole.
Fuck.
Come on.
Move a little faster, baby?
Relax. We got a cease-fire, remember?
Who the fuck goes there?
Joint services, CID, Saigon.
- You here to waste me?
Ease up.
Nobody here to waste you.
Flowers.
We only wanna talk.
Everything's going along fine...
...until I get it narrowed down to like five suspects.
Then my life starts getting bi-fucking-zarre.
These five suspects, were they officers?
I'm off the case.
Go read the files.
There ain't no files.
Somebody took them.
Fellas...
...why don't you build yourselves some nice little trenches out here...
...like me?
Life becomes so simple.
Just you...
...and the fucking war.
Goddamn it, Flowers.
No one from channels knows we're up here.
Just tell us what you know and we'll leave.
Go away. I got work to do.
Fuck this. This is not gonna happen.
I'm gonna find us a hooch to sleep in.
Kiss my ass, huh?
These are pictures of the dead women's kids.
They're just regular kids...
...but now they're alone in the middle of this mess.
I'm alone in the middle of it too, aren't I?
Flowers...
...we need your help.
Fuck them.
Jim, are you okay?
- You over there?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Not much incoming.
Wait till the plane gets here.
There's our bird.
Oh, God, help me, please.
Oh, Father.
- It's Flowers. Give me your hand.
Hey, asshole!
- Hey! Hey!
- Come on, man.
Come on, you can make it!
Come on!
- Come on!
- Fuck you!
You're guilt-trip assholes!
Guilt-trip motherfuckers!
Fuck you!
Fuck you, assholes!
These are his suspects.
Five of these motherfuckers. Ooh.
It's the fucking boss man.
Surprised nobody's fragged his ass by now.
Who the fuck is she?
A victim that got away.
Her name is Nguyen Tri Quan.
Jesus Christ. He had an eyewitness?
Then how come there's still five suspects?
Well, she ran off before he could show her these pictures.
These are the only colonels who were in town on the nights of the murders.
Good work.
I'll mention your names when it goes upstairs.
- Wait.
What do you mean, "upstairs"?
Now, this ain't a thing for you.
- This is an officer thing.
- It always was an officer thing.
Not a colonel officer thing.
You realize how much punch these cocksuckers have in a war zone?
Yeah. Like goddamn royalty.
And we gonna throw one of them in jail.
You work for me?
- Sir?
Do you work for me?
Yes, sir.
Get a haircut, son.
You're not in the field.
You're in Saigon.
Let's get some air.
Gook whores.
I mean, you don't really give that big a shit.
Come on, Top.
We may have lost a man over this.
Besides, it happened on our beat.
Your beat? Your beat?
You're floating in a big sea of shit.
And instead of just staying in the boat...
...no, you reach out and you pick up this one little turd and you say:
"This turd?
Well, this turd pisses me off.
I'm gonna do something about this turd."
Christ.
- Been here too fucking long.
- Oh, fuck it.
All right, I've made my speech.
If you're gonna pursue this...
...you better do it smart.
No more reports.
You send nothing through channels till you get this fucker cold.
Who hates typing more than we do?
You guys...
...a couple of real fucking
Gary Coopers, huh?
Just don't come crying to me when this turns to shit.
And it could, believe you me.
Yes, Nguyen has an infant child here...
...but we haven't seen her for several months.
No one has.
She just disappeared?
Does she have any family or friends that might know where she went?
She has a sister, Lanh.
She works at the stripping place on the corner of Thieu and Tu Do Streets.
The Pink Pu...
The Pink Pussy, sergeant.
We know it well.
Thank you, Sister.
We'll talk to Lanh and see what she knows.
Sergeant.
I don't think Lanh will talk to you.
She's quite political.
She doesn't like Americans.
Is she VC?
She's political.
I'd be happy to talk to her if you'd like.
I think we'd better question Lanh ourselves.
But maybe you could come with us, smooth things over.
I would have to ask mother superior.
No, sergeant.
We always travel in pairs, like you.
So who gets the pretty one on this here double date?
That's Lanh on the stage now.
I figured we could wait backstage.
No, no, a table will be fine.
Yeah, that will be fine.
Are you uncomfortable, sergeant?
You're a nun, Sister.
Do you think we could do this work if something like this shocked us?
I guess not.
I do not talk Gls.
Gls kill my brothers.
They make fuck-things of my sisters.
They have big party in Vietnam.
Lanh, I know about a half a million Gls...
...who would just as soon quit the party and go home, believe me.
Lanh, if these men can talk to Nguyen...
...they feel they can arrest the man who's killing the girls.
Will you help them?
Nguyen leave when colonel tries kill.
She changed.
She no more want to be fuck-thing.
She became a patriot now.
Hey, miss, we don't give a shit what your sister's politics are.
You know, we're just trying to conduct a murder investigation.
Hanoi. You look Hanoi for Nguyen...
...if you can get airplanes stop bombing long enough.
Thank you, Sister.
I'm sorry we were not of more help.
So, now, you're a novice.
When do you become a full-fledged nun?
- I take my final vows in two weeks.
- I see.
I do intend to take them,
Sergeant McGriff.
Of course.
I was just curious.
I should go.
Perhaps there are others I can ask about Nguyen's whereabouts.
Sister, this is my card.
If anything comes up...
...please call.
I would like to apologize for something.
I enjoyed making you uncomfortable in that club.
Some part of me did it on purpose.
I'm not sure why.
It's okay.
... the UCLA
bench. Warren, around the left side.
Lucius Allen can 't shoot.
Feeds it back to Mike Warren.
Warren to the right of the key.
That 1-3- 1 zone being used by Houston,
and Elvin Hayes is playing the big man.
Outside shot, Lucius. Good.
- Go. Beautiful. Cool.
- Eighteen-footer, hammered her.
I've seen him do it 100 times, the big man.
He heads towards the hoop...
...as he's going up, he feeds off to Allen, two points. Beautiful.
Oh, I'm so happy.
- Yeah. You got a crush.
- No.
Hey, man, this is me you're talking to.
I see the way you watch her.
You got a crush.
I think one of the sappers who wasted Rogers is following us.
Nice day for a walk.
You know, we gotta take this little motherfucker alive.
Stand tall, you little fuck.
- Drop the weapon, asshole.
No!
Drop the gun, you...
Who do you work for, pal?
Speak to me.
I think we should pull his fucking nuts off.
- You better go on home, boy.
- Fuck you, America!
You're lucky that didn't hit me in the foot.
I'll come back here and fuck you up.
Where's he coming from?
You see him?
Where is he?
I think he's up here.
I thought I saw him up here.
Forget it!
We better call for a backup. Come on.
No shit.
Back off.
Move out of the way!
Put that stick down.
Get in the car.
We gotta get out of here.
Get off the car!
Fuck you.
- Put that fucking rock down.
Put the rock down!
Get in the fucking car!
Fuck you. Fuck you.
I'm gonna pop you.
I'm gonna pop you.
You've finally succeeded in killing a Vietnamese national, I see.
No, Lime, that's not what happened.
He's lying in the street.
His poor mother is weeping over him.
Did he commit suicide?
Disperse the pissants and then we'll talk.
I'm placing you both under arrest.
Get out of the car with your hands up.
We didn't do it, Lime.
We won't leave the car until the natives are back in their grass huts.
Hand over your weapons and get out of the car. Now.
You wanna give him the satisfaction?
Rather die.
- May have to.
- I said, I'd rather die.
We won't leave unless we go as brother cops.
No cuffs, no arrest.
You shake our hands, we get out of the car...
...you congratulate us and tell us we're cool.
We arrested one of the cowboys who wasted Rogers.
Someone popped him as we were trying to load him into the car.
Yeah, so now Napoleon here wants to arrest us...
...just so he can impress his fans around here.
We have an angry crowd here, sergeant.
The dead man apparently lived in the neighborhood.
I don't give a shit if he lived at the Presidential Palace.
My men are coming with me.
I'm afraid this crowd won't allow it, sergeant.
Fuck the crowd. Let's go.
I'm afraid me and my friends won't allow it either.
Our credibility is very much at stake here today.
Fuck your credibility.
You're outgunned today, sergeant.
Goddamn, when will you people learn?
We're never outgunned.
Give me the Air Con frequency.
Clipper Ship 3, this is Paste Pot 1, over.
This is Clipper Ship 3. Go.
Roger that. You see the guy standing next to me in that lime green ascot?
Yep.
Put the blade at M60 right over his heart. Hold it there.
Roger, 1. I'm on target, coming up.
We'd love to rock 'n ' roll.
You despise me because you think I am corrupt.
In reality, you're too innocent to see corruption right before your eyes.
Your only real danger lies from those above you.
Yeah! Yeah!
It's the record jackets on the suspect colonels.
Where did you score this shit, Dix?
A real top buddy of mine down at USARV.
You can count two of those guys out, by the way.
How's that?
There was only three in town on the day of the last murder.
Which three?
Well, Kitts, the guy you work for,
Scott, guy in your hand...
...and this sweetheart here.
Look at the mug on him.
Fucking guilty. Guilty.
Citadel, West Point...
...commendations, future fucking joint chief.
Yeah. Not only is he one of the youngest full birds in any branch...
Total animal.
- But he's married to a Vietnamese woman...
...and he had a child by her a couple years ago.
Now, the wife and kid were killed in a mortar attack out near Can Tho.
That's about 13 months ago.
Just about the time the murders started.
Sounds just about twisted enough to be right, doesn't it?
He'll be in town next Thursday morning, by the way.
Brass got him talking in the 5:00 follies.
We're gonna be on your ass like stink on shit, motherfucker.
Gentlemen, Colonel Dexter Armstrong...
...chief of staff, 13th Infantry Division.
Presently stationed at firebase Conrad near Can Tho.
Good morning, gentlemen.
I'm here to dispel some of the gloom and doom...
...running rampant in the press since the beginning of Charlie's Tet Offensive.
I work down near Can Tho and I can tell you, personally...
...a lot of what I've been reading is plain bullshit.
Take a look at the map.
All right, my backyard starts about here...
...runs here across here approximately up to here.
And in my backyard, we run the show both day and night.
Where I was raised, we used to say:
"Never write a check with your mouth you can't cash with your ass."
So if any of you don't buy what I just said...
...come on down, take a look for yourself.
I'm telling you, I could be in love with this woman.
Where does she come from?
From God.
She a tea girl?
Yeah, I met her at the Memphis Pride.
This woman had the biggest tits and nipples...
...that I have ever had in my mouth.
You gonna eat that shit?
No, I'm gonna fuck it.
There's our boy.
Looks like my man got his ass a little twinight double header.
Check it out.
Let's get on it.
Francine, come on.
Come on.
Come on.
I'm gonna go up the other end and work my way back.
Are you frightened, Francine?
No sounds, Francine.
Well, well, well.
Got us a peeping Tom here, Mackey.
You get an eyeful, motherfucker?
McGriff, CID.
- I understand you wanna talk to me.
- Yes, sir.
But first I'd like to know who gave these men orders to bring us here.
These men are my children.
They'd open you up and eat your liver if I told them to.
I'm their CO and they love me.
Uncuff them.
Put them in.
Fire it up, son.
Sir, we're conducting a murder investigation.
Saigon prostitutes. Six of them.
- You're a suspect, sir.
- I know. I'm also busy.
- Lift off.
Okay, sir.
So you think I'm a goddamn murderer.
We're just trying to conduct an investigation.
Oh, shut the fuck up.
I'm conducting something of an investigation here myself.
These VC assholes have information I need.
I'll interrogate them as you interrogate me.
Me them, you me. Got that?
- Colonel, I...
Shut the fuck up.
Bring me a gook.
That down here is goddamn Vietnam.
No!
Start asking your questions.
- Sir, don't you think...?
- Start now.
Where were you on the night of January 28th of this year?
City of Saigon,
Republic of South Vietnam.
Ask him where the supply dump for the 58th NVA Division's located.
Interrogate me. Don't stop.
What were your exact whereabouts...
...in Saigon at approximately
2300 hours...
...on January 28th?
Tell him I'll throw his ass out, he doesn't talk to me.
I was with my little fuck-bitch at the Continental Hotel.
We do a sadist trip together with the little girls.
My little fuck-bitch gets off better than I do.
Unlatch his hands.
Tell him if he can throw me off this aircraft, he's a free man. Faster.
Ask your questions faster or I'll have him throw your ass out of here.
Where were you on the nights of January 28th...?
What the fuck...?
Bring me another gook.
My unit is the most decorated unit in country.
We have the highest body count of any unit in Vietnam.
Ask the little fuck where the 58th Division is.
If you two don't start asking me some pertinent questions...
...I'm gonna goddamn court-martial your asses right here, right now.
Have you ever murdered any prostitutes in the city of Saigon?
No, I have never killed a prostitute.
I pinken girls' asses with a riding crop.
That's my little trip.
Only now, you two assholes are gonna put it in your report.
My career will be fucked for all eternity.
I have never killed a whore.
And I'm gonna prove it to you beyond a shadow of a doubt.
Ask him the same.
Another fucking bullshit artist.
Now, that man may have been a bullshit artist...
...but I admired him.
He didn't whimper.
I don't whimper either.
I walk it like talk it.
Now, if I killed a prostitute,
I will stay in the aircraft.
If I did not, I will jump. You got that?
Shit.
Oh, Christ. Put your hands up.
I said, get your fucking hands up.
You killed the goddamn colonel.
- We didn't kill him. He fucking jumped.
- We're CID.
The colonel was under investigation for multiple civilian murders in Saigon.
He committed suicide. Just ask him.
Colonel Armstrong wild-fuck son of a bitch. He jump out.
- We're going back to the firebase.
- Like shit we are. They'll waste us.
Take us to the MPs in Saigon.
Either that or you shoot us here.
It's your call, pal.
Jesus Christ, the goddamn colonel.
The shit's gonna hit the fan.
We're gonna have shit all over the fucking place.
Now you two are in big fucking trouble.
Why is that?
Keep it down till we get outside, huh?
You sorry assholes.
Took some doing but I got you released to my custody...
...because they're all waiting for
General Bower to get back from Guam.
- And the rumors are flying.
- What kind of rumors?
How you forced the colonel to take a plane ride...
...so you could grill his ass till he killed himself.
Right. Meantime...
...the crazy motherfucker's body-bombing VCs and killing whores.
- The man was guilty.
- All right. The game plan is this:
We go over to the office,
I get your depositions.
We'll get you to your billets, get your shit, get on the plane out of here.
What do you mean, "out of here"?
Your traveling papers, girls.
Just came through.
You report to Fort Ord, California,
Monday, 0800 hours.
What?
Somebody fucked up. They're rotating you a couple of weeks early.
What, you looking a gift horse in the ass?
Shouldn't we be here to defend ourselves when they start the investigation?
That's what the deposition is for.
It turns out Armstrong is like young Jesus around here...
...and the brass is mightily pissed.
In a couple days, they'll get used to it.
Until then, they're looking for blood.
They don't care whose.
You're leaving. Orders is orders.
Well, it's a duffle-bag drag.
When I was looking through Armstrong's Form 20...
...I noticed he was a young lieutenant back in Korea.
We had the same thing going on over there.
Hookers being killed?
Yeah, same m.o.
Went unsolved back then.
Wouldn't surprise me if it was the same guy.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Look...
...I'd have got you something better, but it all happened pretty quick.
- I'll open mine right now.
Go ahead.
Lord have mercy.
Hey, look, don't bite any stews' rumps on the way home.
I got you on a commercial flight.
Thanks, Dix.
Not for this.
- It was a good tour.
Yeah, our paths will cross again.
I only got six months left in this shithole myself.
Maybe I'll put in for Ord, huh?
Take the next right up here.
What you wanna do?
Give her a kiss goodbye?
Just wanna tell her it's all wrapped up and say so long.
She was a good Joe.
Sister?
Lanh. The dancer we visited.
She was...
...killed last night.
How did it happen?
The same as the others.
Only this time he killed the child.
No, please.
I'm sorry, Sister.
I thought it was over.
You two will be picking up where Perkins and McGriff left off.
I'll be working close with you because now I'm pissed off.
The files of this mess are over at HQ.
Just get your asses over there right now.
Son of a bitch.
When did this come in, Dix?
About a half an hour after you left.
- Who are these guys?
- The new investigators.
- You guys are out of here.
- Not yet, we're not.
You miss that flight and you are AWOL.
You got 40 goddamn minutes.
Come on, get.
Hey, take these two to Tan Son Nhut and stick with them.
Goddamn it. Can't you see?
Someone sped up those orders because of what we're working on.
That is either true or it is not.
In either case,
I'm the one that's gotta deal with it.
You are enlisted men and they can put you in fucking jail. Move them out!
I'm coming.
Oh, man, fuck them insect hookers.
I refuse to give a shit.
We weren't doing it for them.
We were doing it for us.
To give it all some kind of fucking meaning.
Leaving this place outside a plastic bag is all the meaning I need.
Get down!
Hey. Hey.
Jesus.
I was hit.
Am I gonna be all right?
Am I gonna be all right?
I want... I wanna sit up.
I wanna sit up.
Jesus.
The little fuck is coming back.
He's coming back?
What's he coming back for?
- What's he coming back for?
- Get down!
What the fuck are you coming back for?
Hey! What you coming back for?
What the fuck are you coming back for?
You motherfucker.
Go ahead on.
Hey, they had a prisoner.
Just put it down.
- Clear the streets, Neil.
Spread out.
Get this gun out of here.
Come on, let's go. We're walking.
- You're dead now, you motherfucker.
Put him in the back.
I ain't dead.
Fucking gook motherfucker.
I'm talking to you.
What happened to you?
Somebody on our side tried to kill us.
I had no place to go.
What time is it?
It's almost 9.
How badly are you hurt?
I'm okay.
I'm worried about my partner.
I know where Nguyen is.
I have known.
I take her child to her every two weeks.
Why didn't you tell us?
I was sworn to secrecy.
Where is she?
She is with the Vietcong near Cu Chi.
Will she talk to us now that her sister's been killed?
She believes she will also be killed if she comes to Saigon.
Can I go to her?
Why not, Sister?
You know these people.
You could tell them what we're trying to do.
You're an American soldier. Do you have any idea the hatred they have for you?
Doesn't anyone give a fuck but me and my partner?
Please, just hold me.
I'm sorry, Sister.
This world is so insane.
What a play!
UCLA with the ball again.
Alcindor's at the top of the key.
He wants it. He wants the ball.
He's got it!
Two men on him. Fakes left.
Oh, what a move!
That's the win.
He gets his own rebound.
He fakes again.
Gorillas the ball and two points.
Two points.
He's fouled on the play.
The crowd's going wild.
Big man's gotta make two.
Two to win the game.
He sets.
He shoots.
He misses.
Are you all right?
Nothing can hurt the big man.
How'd you get away?
Medics took off my cuffs.
Big man made a fast break...
...and he ran and he ran and he...
You didn't hurt anybody, did you?
Does big man wanna go for a ride?
Where?
Where we always been going.
Swish.
He says he can only get through the checkpoints for a short time.
Sergeant McGriff?
I'll spit in your fucking face.
All right. All right. Stop shoving me.
Stop shoving me. Shit.
I'm going.
Chickenshit motherfucker.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
We're gonna fucking die down here.
Oh, my God.
Nguyen.
We've narrowed it down to two men.
Which one?
No here.
Now, you look at these pictures.
Look at these pictures. It's one of these.
- Just...
- No.
There.
This man here?
This man here? Lime Green.
Not Viet man.
GI here.
This picture old.
He colonel now.
Have ugly mark on arm.
Oh, man. Where the fuck we gonna find him now?
Oh, Jesus.
Shit.
He was an officer himself once, you know.
He performed a series of heroic acts back in Korea.
He was recommended for a field commission...
...to the rank of second lieutenant.
But then his regimental commander saw his...
His tattoo.
Very working class.
It so offended his regimental commander...
...that his field commission was never sent through.
I've sinned.
Hear my confession, Sister.
Like a priest.
Dix's regimental commander was married to a Korean woman.
Typical.
Whore.
But he did love her.
Yeah, boy.
Killing her was the only way...
...to truly make him feel the kind of pain that Dix felt...
...by being cheated out of his commission.
There were a few more after that.
Pow. Pow.
Get out of the fucking way!
Then he behaved.
For years, he behaved.
One dog-eared noncom barracks after another.
They gotta be up top.
They gotta be.
Dix's pain wouldn't just go away...
...no matter how many whores he killed.
Goddamn you!
If it wasn't for you, they never would have found him.
Dix. Enough.
How did it go?
It was really beautiful.
You should have come in.
No, man.
I ain't into that voodoo shit.
California.
- You ever been there?
- Yeah.
- You?
- No.
Different.
You know who I got a letter from?
Who's that?
Remember that sweet thing...
...I met at the Memphis Pride?
With big tits and huge nipples?
So she writes me a letter and she starts it off:
"My sweet Albaby...
...I love you too much."
- "Love you too much."
Peace.

IRA a dollar-franc.
Four-ninety-eight, 40, 60.
The market's going against us.
We're exposed on the 100 million.
- We're gonna have to bail out.
- We'll take a whopping loss.
We can't buck the tide any longer.
Let me know the damage when you've finished.
- Hold the phones!
- Hold on.
Okay, no arguments. Everybody cover their short-currency positions.
Buy yen, sterling, francs, marks.
Sell dollars.
We've got 100 million to dump.
No haggling over prices.
- Dollar's off.
- How much?
Two percent against the mark in 20 minutes.
It started in Frankfurt.
No. I think you'll find it started about 10 blocks from here.
At Borough National, as a matter of fact.
They're in trouble.
Bailing out of their long-dollar position.
Dumping about 100 million.
Keep talking.
Let me know if it slides further...
...or hits the next big number.
Frankfurt? Borough National New York.
A dollar-deutsche mark.
Would you like...?
Can you make me a market of spot francs?
- Give me another market!
- Another Geneva for 30-60. Want it?
- Sell eight at 30!
- Two, two at 20.
Hello, Bern National.
Yeah, how do you trade in French?
- What's your spot on yen?
- Take two!
- Three.
- You'll only do three?
- Five million.
- We want sterling.
- Four.
- Good.
- What's the dollar-yen, please?
- Five at 75.
- Make it two. That's four.
- Okay.
- Take it.
- Four done.
- Do you want it? Forty-60!
- Sell five at 40.
- They'll only take two!
- Take the lousy two!
- All right, that's just one!
- I love you too. You're beautiful.
How about four? All right, two.
- Help me out.
- What do you mean there's no market?
It's coming? So is Christmas.
I can't get Bern!
They're closed for the day!
- We look like we're having trouble.
- Europe and the Street...
...know we're dumping.
The dollar's dropping like a rock.
All right, we'd better go in.
Long on dollars. Start with Paris.
And tell Borough National they can have 40 mil on Interbank.
We're going to have to find someone to ride shotgun over there.
I'm not taking this roller coaster again.
Earlier this week, the dollar slipped 50 points.
It recovered. But a lot of people say things are going to get worse...
... before they get better.
Others in the banking community say it was just a flutter.
But if there's one thing all of us worry about, it's money. Our money.
In this case, of course, the dollar.
Here tonight to discuss the dollar is Maxwell Emery...
... president of The First New York Bank.
Mr. Emery has sometimes been called the lion of American banking.
The dollar's been under pressure so frequently in our history.
I don't think these times are exceptional.
We go through regular cycles of anxiety.
In fact, we're an anxiety-prone people.
But we've never had anxiety with so much reason behind it.
Since 1974, when the Arabs started increasing the price of oil...
... they've amassed billions of dollars.
Until now, they've been very kind to leave that money largely in American banks.
Mr. Emery, has there ever been such a concentration of wealth...
... in the hands of one group before?
No, I think probably not.
But I assure you, their interests are ours.
Have a good time.
Thank you.
- Wonderful party.
- Charlie will be by later.
- He's working late at the office.
- See you then.
Enjoy yourself.
Want an educated opinion?
You won't get a glamour boy like Hubbell
Smith to run a rescue operation over there.
He won't touch it with a fork.
He might. If the payoff is big enough.
Could I have a white wine and a Scotch on the rocks, please?
Well, Max, I hear you rode in on your white horse...
...and bailed out Borough National.
Well, that fellow down there is trying, but he's overmatched.
I feel sorry for the poor son of a bitch who tries to fix that mess.
I said I'd help them but only if they'd take my boy.
Wanna hear the deal?
I don't know, Max.
I did my time in the trenches...
...when I was running those problem loans for you.
I had enough crash-and-burn.
Hub...
...I'd consider it a personal favor.
With those turkeys at Borough National, miracle is a better word.
Now, why do you piss cold water on it when you know you're interested?
What makes you so sure?
The guy who turns them round is going to be hero of the week.
And we both know that you're restless, ambitious...
...and a sucker for a chance at a star play.
- That's the spirit that built the West.
- Has either one of you seen Lee Winters?
Last time I saw her she was over by the band.
Something wrong?
Charlie Winters has been murdered.
A mugger broke into his office and knifed him.
Oh, my God.
Isn't it?
I love the way he plays too. Don't you?
- Hello, Bill.
- Lee, could I talk to you alone?
- Would you excuse us?
- Certainly.
What is it, Hub?
Nothing.
I was just thinking about the illusion of safety.
- Yes.
- You were inquiring about Charlie Winters...
... the other day.
I'm sorry to have to tell you that he's dead.
I was struck by the coincidence.
Charles Winters.
I'm sorry to hear about that.
I'm sorry to hear about it too.
I just wanted you to be aware.
Good night.
Police have concluded Charles Winters was murdered by a burglar...
... who panicked when Winters, who was working late, surprised him.
No other motivations for his murder have been found.
At his funeral yesterday in New York, his widow, ex-film star Lee Winters...
... was accompanied by leading members of the corporate and financial world.
So Lee Winters, the poor girl who came out of the dirt hills of Arkansas...
... to achieve stardom as the glamorous Ashley Norman...
... one of Hollywood's most respected actresses...
... who, at the height of her career, gave it up to become the wife...
... of a great American industrialist...
... played today her toughest role: where to go from here.
There are rumors that things aren't what they were...
... in the troubled petrochemical empire built by Winters...
... now facing the critical question of who will become its next chairman.
And now in a...
Don't take too long.
Hurry back down.
- Gaby, did you take my book?
- What book?
Well, Paris, we're seeing some pressure out of Zurich.
Eleven's ringing. Who's on 11?
But we think it's topping out.
We're all atwitter.
Let me have your dollar-franc, please.
The question is, is he ready for us?
I've had a balance sheet worked up...
...and a summary of assets.
Is there anything else you might need?
Oh, nothing special.
Your interim financials maybe.
Something showing your cash position, loan position, deposits.
Also a P & L statement, if you've got one.
The maturity schedules on your commercial paper. Classifications on your loan portfolio.
Maybe the last examiner's report.
Oh, and your current profit breakdown.
You sure that'll be enough?
For a start.
Cheers.
Well, doctor, you've been on the case for a while now. What's the prognosis?
Will the patient live?
The patient's been dead for six months and doesn't know it.
Come on, now. It's not that bad.
No?
Roy, I salute you.
Borough National's your masterpiece.
Well, we may have to tighten our belt.
Try it around your neck.
Okay.
- I'll call Emery. You can bail out.
- No, I took this trip without a parachute.
- This is when the fun begins.
- Smith, this is not some sort of game.
Yes, it is. That's exactly what it is.
You keep talking about a system, Roy.
That's your problem.
You can't beat the system, but you can win a game.
- How?
- First, we have to find a way...
...to get some profit in here now.
Just 3 or 4 million...
...so we can meet that dividend and give ourselves a little time to breathe.
A nice, hungry customer so we can give him a big, fat loan.
Say, a couple 100 million.
- Collect the commission.
- Where are we gonna get the money?
I'll find the money.
What we need right now is a customer.
We really need a company even more in the shithouse than we are.
If that's possible.
Sit down, Roy.
Talk to me about the Winterchem Petrochemical Corporation.
We're loaned out to them to the legal limit.
No matter how hungry they are, we can't give them a thing.
Not even lunch?
I'll start with what you're dying to hear.
We don't need to borrow another dime.
Well, I don't know what to say.
All we have to do is scale down a little.
Think in more modest terms, and we should weather the storm.
I don't think it makes any sense at all.
This is wrong. You can't cut back on this company and expect it to ever grow again.
The replacement cost would be astronomical.
We're grateful for your interest in Winterchem.
All the public relations you've put in for the company.
And I know how you must feel, especially now that Charlie's gone.
Henry, don't patronize me.
You know where we went wrong. We let the competition walk away with the technology.
Instead of cutting, we must invest in R & D.
Keep the plants going until new products are developed.
- Financed how?
- We'll just get ourselves a moneymaker.
There's a small petrochemical plant in Spain at Valencia.
They're in place.
Their balance sheet looks real good.
And they're for sale. We'd have to invest in some updating and a sure feedstock.
If we get it, we'll be buying ourselves a real cash-flow machine.
I hear you, but that kind of capital is simply not available.
Sorry, good people. I'm running late.
Roy, fill me in on the rest of this later.
Ms. Winters.
- Henry.
- Delighted to have met you.
- Warner.
- Good to see you.
That's a hell of a fella. I think we're gonna enjoy working with him.
Let me speak with Lee Winters, please.
She's at the far corner table.
Lee, you're gonna be opening the Palm Beach house soon?
Sorry, Mrs. Winters, a call for you.
Thank you. Excuse me, I'm sorry.
Yes, this is Mrs. Winters.
How good are you at keeping a straight face?
Because your Valencia deal happens to be full of holes.
Helen, I can't talk now.
I'm at a luncheon meeting.
- lf you have some messages...
- Try this on Helen.
Number one, what about currency translation?
A Spanish plant has peseta obligations.
If the peseta goes up...
... your dollar earnings won't be worth a plate of frijoles.
Two, how about labor stability?
Half the country's busy slipping bombs in the pockets of the other half.
Three, Winterchem's tapped out with us at Borough National.
How do you figure to fund the acquisition?
I see.
Is that all, Helen?
Sorry, but I didn't wanna embarrass you in front of Tweedledum and Tweedledee...
... since it's obvious that you wanna be the new chairman of the board.
No, absolutely not. Would you tell him
I'm out of town, please?
I'm sorry. Some people just don't understand business.
Absolutely.
Of course we're gonna show a profit.
One, their currency may be unstable, but they have to sell in international markets...
...so our dollar wouldn't be affected.
Two, the Spanish labor market happens to be relatively strike-free...
...which you would have known if you'd bothered to check, as I did.
Three, there are other banks that recognize a sound investment when they see one.
As for that "chairman of the board" remark...
...Mr. Smith, I don't know what you're talking about.
How much stock did you say her husband left her?
You were saying?
I thought we ought to have a drink on it.
On what exactly?
Your future at Winterchem.
Scotch, if you don't mind, with a twist.
Mr. Smith, you must have me confused with an executive.
They tolerated me on the board because of Charlie.
But now that he's gone, I'm just an ex-movie star coasting into the sunset.
Not someone throwing them a curve ball at lunch...
...about a Spanish petrochemical plant.
I'd say you coast pretty good.
Where'd you learn the moves?
Charlie involved me a lot in the business.
And when I was an actress,
I had my own company.
I made my own deals.
Charlie always says I have...
Charlie used to say I had good instincts.
Well, we're playing the classic scene, aren't we?
The banker and the widow.
I'm sorry. I guess this is all too soon.
Of course it's too soon.
Everything's too soon, isn't it?
The company's in trouble too soon.
Charlie died too soon.
So what? lt'd be funny, wouldn't it?
If the banker helped the widow walk off with the chairmanship.
Hilarious.
You mind telling me how?
- Your Valencia deal.
- I thought you said it was full of holes.
I thought you said you didn't wanna be chairman.
Too bad because Ackerman's just blowing smoke...
...about all this so-called support.
Nobody really wants to sell off.
Nobody wants to be on the board of a shrinking company.
You nail that deal, you have a real shot.
Providing they took me seriously.
Come up with the 500 million to buy that plant, and they'll take you seriously.
All you need is the okay from Ackerman to go after it.
And I'm in a position to put you together with the money.
There are risks involved.
I've never been afraid of risks.
That was Scotch with a twist.
For one thing, I'm not gonna get the okay.
Aren't you the man that told me
Winterchem...
...was borrowed out with the bank?
I'm the man.
- Where's the money supposed to come from?
- Private placement. Outside source.
- Direct?
- Through an agent I know.
We'd have to negotiate with his people.
Probably be a joint venture if they put up the capital and share the profits.
And the bank collects 1 percent for setting it up.
On 500 million, that's 5 million profit.
No risk to you.
You have a very profitable sense of humor, Mr. Smith.
You wouldn't deny me a little incentive, would you?
No.
Was that on the rocks or straight up?
Of course, we do have to handle her very carefully.
Yes. She is sitting on the largest block of company stock.
If she sells her stock to some outfit, we could all be out on our collective ass.
I say to hell with her damn stock.
What's she gonna do, unload
600,000 shares? That's her meal ticket.
This isn't The Washington Post, and she's not Katherine Graham.
And I'll tell you, that woman is not going to negotiate any deals for this management.
Ever.
Would you ask Mrs. Winters to come in, please?
Next thing she'll want to be chairman of the board.
Now, Lee, we want you to know you'll always have a home at Winterchem.
Remember, we'll always be happy to hear any suggestions you might have.
- Mr. Ackerman, please.
- One moment, please.
- At least we didn't overestimate him.
- Hello.
- Warner, this is Hub.
- Hi, what's up?
Nothing special. I just thought it was time we sat down...
...and had a talk about rescheduling your loans.
- Maybe lunch next week?
- How about Thursday?
Right, fine.
By the way, I had a talk with that Japanese conglomerate...
...that's buying up every company in sight.
- Did you?
Yeah, Shigemitsu-Han.
They wanted to talk about the Winterchem financials.
Of course, I wouldn't, but I thought you ought to know.
No problem.
They tried to take us over last year...
... but couldn't get enough stock.
Well, in that case, we can all relax.
So where do you guys like to eat?
How about the Bibliotheque next Thursday at 1?
- Thursday at 1, right.
- See you then.
I can't wait to see their faces when they think I'm gonna sell my stock.
- Hello.
- Helen.
Would you contact Shigemitsu-Han and ask if we can have lunch Thursday at 1.
Thursday at 1.
Hi, Lee.
So she won't sell her stock, huh?
Good move, Warner.
Well, I'm starved. How about you guys?
- I could use a drink.
- So could I.
How did I do?
Ackerman didn't eat a bite.
- How long do we have to wait?
- As long as it takes.
- lf it takes.
- Patience, patience.
They have to huddle first.
Look unconcerned, get back to the office and argue a little bit.
They're probably flipping a coin right now to see who has to make the call.
Yeah.
Right, put him on.
Guess who lost.
Hey, Warner, long time no see.
Hi. Listen, Hub,
I know you'll think I'm nuts...
... but we may let Lee Winters check out the financing on that Spanish thing after all.
She's got an idea she can find the 500 million somewhere privately.
She'll probably give away the family jewels to get it.
Would it make you happier if I kept an eye on her for you?
Jesus, could you?
That would be really terrific.
- We don't want to look like total idiots.
- Consider it done.
Hub, I want you to know we'll always be grateful.
Just your friendly neighborhood banker.
They'll always be grateful.
We're not there yet.
You still have to meet the agent for the 500 million tonight at Emery's.
Any ideas on how I should handle it?
Straightforward.
We've got nothing to hide.
Do we?
Please, Ms. Winters, excuse me.
I know this isn't the time or place...
...but did your husband ever mention
Jerry Fewster?
There's someone named Fewster. Did your husband ever mention anything about him?
In what connection?
- You mean he didn't?
- I don't know. What was it about?
No, if he didn't mention it, that's fine.
It's fine.
- What did you say the name was?
- No, it doesn't matter.
I'm sorry I bothered you.
- Excuse me, does he work here?
- You mean Mr. Fewster?
He's one of the federal bank examiners who come in.
He's very nervous.
I don't believe Mr. Winters told her anything.
She looked right at me.
She didn't know what I was talking about.
That's my train.
Well, if you hear from her again, we expect to hear from you.
Okay?
Not gonna eat your hot dog, huh?
- Well, here they are.
- Oh, Hub.
- I was concerned.
- Courtney, I'm sorry we're late.
- You know Lee Winters?
- Good evening. Lovely to have you.
Would you take her down by Max?
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- Sorry we're late.
- Don't worry about it. So glad you're here.
- Hello, Hub.
- Sorry, Max, got caught in traffic.
Lee, I'd like you to meet Sal Naftari.
How do you do, Mr. Naftari?
Mrs. Winters, at last. I was beginning to be afraid I might not get to meet you.
For a few seconds there,
I had doubts myself.
But I can't tell you how happy
I am that we made it.
Oh, Mrs. Winters, I was just telling Max before you came...
...that I've just come back from Paris.
The state of the dollar is in crisis.
I don't know what you naughty bankers are gonna do to us next.
Do you know that I couldn't buy a single thing?
It's awful. I'm gonna have to wear
American clothes all summer.
- Two percent.
- Not this time.
Okay, 2 and a half.
Eight.
Eight? Why 8?
It's a woman. Makes it tougher.
Hub, get it out of your head.
I've got a lock on this.
These people are unpredictable.
They make up their own minds.
I'm only the agent.
I can only make the introductions.
The rest is up to you.
If my deal is too rich, you're always welcome to try it on your own.
- Okay, 8.
- Plus a fee of 300,000 for contingencies.
- Such as?
- lf I knew, they wouldn't be contingencies.
I'll get right on it, providing, of course, that's acceptable.
Also, she'll have to travel.
They'll want a meeting.
- We welcome you.
- Thank you, Khalid.
We're glad to be here.
My associate, Mrs. Winters.
- How do you do?
- Mrs. Winters, welcome. Please.
Come.
I believe you know my father, Ahmed.
Of course.
He thanks you for honoring us with your visit.
Not at all.
You honor us with the invitation.
And Mrs. Winters.
How do you do?
I feel like a beggar asking them for alms, and I hate it.
You and the rest of the world.
I thought we had an appointment.
This is an appointment.
Mrs. Winters, please.
Hub, good to see you.
To begin with, I'm sure you will be pleased to hear we have decided to make the loan.
But first, I think it best to go over this...
...to make sure we are clear on the main points.
Point one...
...the sum is to be 500 million, of course, for the plant in Valencia...
...the money to be drawn in units of 50 million.
At times to be negotiated.
Yes, of course.
Point two, Winterchem to hold title...
...but profits to be shared on an equal basis.
Point three, Mrs. Winters' stock will stand as security...
...for the entire transaction.
- Point four...
- Excuse me.
That means if something happens,
I lose all my stock.
Mrs. Winters...
...I should tell you there are those in the family...
...who do not think we should be making this offer at all.
I assume if you could've found venture capital of this sort...
...for a company like Winterchem in America...
...you would not be coming all the way to Arabia looking for it.
If you are able to arrange better terms elsewhere, you are free to do so.
Shall I continue?
Point four...
...after repayment of the principal has been completed...
...all interest payments must be made by the 15th day of each month.
If we're ever cash short when a payment comes due, I could lose the whole company.
Don't worry. We'll cover you on that.
The bank will cover you.
I don't like the risk.
I guess it depends on how bad you wanna be the chairman.
Well, I guess I should call the cockpit.
Have them radio the office with the gory details.
Hey, that can wait.
This can't.
You're really ticked off about the deal, aren't you?
I'm sorry.
I just don't...
I don't like being dependent, that's all.
I was never dependent on any one studio.
I didn't depend on Charlie.
And if anything goes wrong, I don't like being dependent on Borough National.
You mean me.
Here.
If you can't live with the deal, forget it.
Tell New York the terms are unacceptable.
I warn you, I'm a problem.
I'm a bad person when I get in a corner.
Fine. If you get in a corner, tell me to go to hell.
In business, that's the ground rules.
But if you think the only thing we've been doing together is business...
...one of us is a fool.
Would you radio Winterchem in New York, please?
Tell them we've come to terms on the whole package.
Well, you got your deal.
You got what you want.
You don't know the first goddamn thing I want.
It's not the deal.
The world's full of deals.
A partner's somewhat more rare.
I'm still not sure I trust you, you know.
That's a perfect basis for a partnership.
Thirty thousand.
Just bumped him out of 20 million.
I thought you ought to see that.
They just want us to hold it?
Not roll it over?
Doesn't make sense.
They'll lose a ton of interest if they don't re-deposit that money.
Must be a mistake.
Ask them to send it again.
You got it.
By the way, how much is the deposit for?
Altogether, 95 million.
Rebecca, let's get a confirmation on that.
Let me have the maturity schedules...
...on those Saudi Eurodollar deposits we're holding.
The ones that are due now or all of them?
- The works.
- What's going on?
Nineteen deposits worth 5 million each are due...
...and the Saudis didn't give us disposition instructions.
You got 23 more maturing in the next three weeks...
...which is 210 million we're gonna have to come up with...
...if they decide not to roll over.
- Two hundred and ten million?
That's practically every cent we carry.
It'll clean us out.
They can't let that money sit without earning interest.
Even the Arabs aren't that rich.
Maybe they'll advise us through their London affiliate, I hope.
Forty-60, anything there?
If you wait five minutes,
I'll have an answer.
That yen deal we lost, who was the customer, and why did we lose it?
Hapsas Oil. First New York must have wanted the trade badly.
They bid one point over market.
Mr. Naftari returning your call.
- Put him on. I got five minutes to kill.
- Yes, sir.
I don't know. Some guys will go anywhere to find a topless beach.
Hey, Sal, how's Monte Carlo, you turkey?
- Not bad. Something on your mind?
- No, nothing special...
...except your friend Dawasir doesn't seem to have both his oars in the water.
What's going on?
They got a couple of Eurodollar deposits maturing. No big deal.
But they're just letting them sit.
You happen to know anything about it?
Nobody's talked to me.
I haven't heard a word.
Well, Europe's gonna start closing in a few minutes.
They work through London and Zurich, and the interest they're losing...
Well, what about it?
Hub, you got a problem?
Hey, listen, if it's okay with them, it's just fine with me. What do I care?
Then there's no problem?
Yeah, kid, talk to you.
Shit.
He said you don't seem to have both of your oars in the water.
You cannot pull $95 million in one chunk...
...from a bank the size of Borough National.
When I undertook to manage this plan...
...you agreed to do it gradually in small amounts.
You're now starting to move billions in a matter of weeks.
The world economic situation is deteriorating...
...more rapidly than we had thought.
We don't think we can afford to wait, Max.
There will be no collapse in the foreseeable future unless you panic...
...and start it with some damn fool move like this.
And if you are wrong, what then?
We wake up one morning, our oil is gone.
We find we have sold all we have in exchange for paper money that is worthless.
You're risking immediate exposure.
We risk it every day.
If Charles Winters could stumble on that account...
...it's just a question of time before someone else finds out.
- And when that happens...
- No one else will find out...
...if you revert to your original timetable.
All right, Max.
We'll think about it.
But I'm not sure what our answer will be.
You're playing with the end of the world, you know.
The end of the world as you know it.
Europe's closing.
You're on your own. No dispositions.
I don't want anyone playing hero.
- Give me the FYCB.
- Okay, let's hedge ourselves.
Cover at least half the amount of the deposits for one day.
First New York and Morgan,
24 million each.
Morgan, this is Borough National.
First New York, let me have your Fed Funds desk.
Listen, we got room for 24, 25.
- Right.
- No problem, get back to you.
- Morgan's tight today.
- First New York's dry.
Come back tomorrow if we have a problem.
This could be a real situation here,
Europe closing down.
If we can't find the cash to cover those
Eurodollar deposits we're shit out of luck.
Okay, try Boston and Chase, but that's it.
Let's not blow it all over the street.
As long as nobody else knows...
Now what the hell is that?
Dollar's dropping.
Dropping? It's going through the basement, for chrissake. Why?
Hey, Hub, it's Paris. They heard some big Arab money is pulling out here.
- They're gonna start shorting dollars.
- They're nuts.
Negative. Kill those calls to Boston and Chase.
- That's what they said.
- Tell them we're buying.
- We're buying?
- Tell them.
Dollar dropping fast against marks and yen.
Add sterling and guilders to that.
Okay, just button up. No more calls go out of here until I tell you.
You better call your mama, both of you.
You're gonna be late for supper.
Vince, this is Gil. I'm bottom-fishing.
You got any ideas?
No, no, nothing definite.
I wanted to flag it at the Fed just in case.
- Hang up.
- No, not much.
Maybe 100 mil or so.
Hang up that phone, Roy, or so help me
God, I'll tear it out of the wall.
Sorry, I'm getting a little static here.
I'll be back to you.
Look, Smith, you can save the dramatics for some other time.
Are you crazy?
Are you right out of your fucking skull?
Nobody knows we're broke.
I'm busting my ass to act like business as usual...
...and you call the Federal Reserve Bank.
Why not take an ad in The New York-fucking- Times?
Everything is drying up on you.
You can't get it anywhere.
I say we go to the Fed and make a clean breast of it.
And blow everything.
Look, the Fed will never find out.
We'll issue some domestic CDs to cover the Eurodollar deposits.
By the time we add up our tabs, it'll be two weeks from now.
By then, everything will be fine.
So we ran a little behind on bookkeeping. So what?
You can't do that. That's illegal.
That is criminal, for chrissake.
Mildly. We can get by with it for one night.
- You don't know what's gonna happen.
- Walk to the Fed...
...let them know,
I'll tell you what's gonna happen.
You won't open tomorrow.
With the performance record you've had, they'll shut our ass down for good.
We gotta sweat it out and pray the Saudis roll over that 95 million...
...before Europe opens in the morning.
It's the only chance we got.
Come on, Roy, where's your balls?
You're the one who's crazy.
I don't know anything about this.
I am not losing my deniability.
You can hide in the closet if you want to...
...but you're staying right here.
If I catch you on the phone,
I'll break your fucking arm.
What are you gonna do if the Saudis ask for that money?
I'll worry about it in the morning.
I gotta get through the night first.
Sorry, Eurodollar section says the market's getting worse. Liquidity's drying up.
- How much of this is around the floor?
- Not a lot.
Okay, here's the drill. For the rest of the afternoon, no strong positions, no exposure.
- Keep it humming. You got me?
- Yes, sir.
Hong Kong opens 8:00 our time.
Maybe they'll run it through them.
You and Betsy stay. I'll get back from reception as soon as I can.
You're not going to that Winters reception tonight, are you?
We're expected.
And since the only conceivable reason for our absence would be a crisis at the bank...
...and since that's what we don't want people to know we're up to our ass in...
...one of us better be there.
She's only the new chairman of the board of one of our biggest customers.
Excuse me just a second, Howard, Nancy.
- Hello, Mr. Smith.
- Good evening.
Are you over your jet lag?
- Bankers aren't allowed to have jet lag.
- Oh, no?
I feel lucky. Warner's agreed to be chief operating officer.
Glad to hear it.
Roy Lefcourt sends his congratulations.
He's a little under the weather.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
I appreciate your being here.
Thanks for your help.
This is gonna work out all right.
Oh, thank you.
N-A...
...blank, blank, L-E.
Cremona.
Me, any joy?
No. Nothing moving here but the leaves on the trees.
Hong Kong opens in 10 minutes.
Want me to take a sniff?
And have it in Paris through the back door? Better not.
How's our friend bearing up?
I think he has visions of numbers on his chest.
He's not the only one.
Let's keep the hatches battened down. Not a word.
Well...
...that sounds fine.
Just keep tracking.
We could get a move out of it.
I'll check in myself if I get a chance.
Not the bank.
I might have to drift over there for a couple of minutes.
Tonight?
Nothing they couldn't handle themselves.
But I think I better look in on them.
- Don't wait up for me.
- You're so tense.
Are you all right?
At the peak of my form, lady.
Good night, Nettie.
Would you order the car to be out front?
Yes, madame.
I think I'll go down to the office for a while.
Fewster, let me tell you the reason I'm here.
You know all about Winterchem, and you know Winterchem...
... depends a great deal on its connection with Borough National Bank.
I've been very concerned about
Borough National Bank's stability.
Mr. Winters, the fact that I am the bank examiner...
... I'm not allowed to discuss any findings.
I hired a private detective.
I hired him to check on you because...
On me? You hired him to check on me personally?
I happen to know...
... that you took a very low-interest loan. Am I right?
For the purchase of a house from First New York.
Is that correct, Mr. Fewster?
This low-interest loan, Mr. Fewster...
... some people might consider it to be unethical.
Others, even as a bribe.
And of course, that would be criminal.
You're asking for information that concerns something bigger...
... than Borough National Bank.
Fewster, I guarantee you...
... you'll have my protection.
Now you just tell me what you know.
I discovered...
... an account, 21214.
Mr. Winters, is the tape machine running?
Yes.
Please, sir, turn it off.
London branch.
They're rolling over 90 million!
I think we can all go home and get some rest now.
- Night, guys.
- Night.
Good night.
Why only 90 million?
What about the other 5?
We're gonna pay the balance of 5 to First New York. Account 21214.
Do me a favor, will you?
Get me all our Saudi records.
Look at this slippage.
All over the last couple of years.
Every month, 8 million,
7 million, 7 million...
...all to that same account number,
21214, First New York.
Could be anything.
An adjustment in the general portfolio or loans.
Be nice to know more about that account.
I'll worry about it later.
Jesus, what a night.
I feel like the sack of Carthage.
What happened at the bank last night?
You act like a man who just had a reprieve from the electric chair.
No, I don't think it can wait until you come to New York.
Mr. Fewster, I can come to Washington today to see you.
Well, I'd like to see you today if that's possible.
Well, where would you like to meet?
I can meet anywhere you want.
In a parking lot?
No, that's fine.
Brown station wagon.
What's the license number?
Would 2:00 be all right?
Thank you very much. I appreciate it,
Mr. Fewster. Thank you. Yes.
Kay, cancel my 1:00.
I'm gonna take the noon shuttle...
...to Washington. And would you have a car reserved for me at the other end?
- Mr. Fewster?
- Mrs. Winters, please get in.
I'm sitting on something.
I'm sorry.
Do you always meet people like this?
I don't meet people at all.
Not prime customers of the bank
I've just examined.
I'm sorry you insisted on coming down here, Mrs. Winters...
...because I can't tell you anything.
I need to know what you told my husband about Borough National.
I told him nothing.
Mr. Fewster...
...I found the tape.
Now, there's enough on that to get you in trouble.
But there's not enough to help me, and I have to know.
I have to know if the bank is rocky...
...if it's losing money.
- It isn't money.
It's where the money is going. And...
...I can't talk about it.
- Well, at least give me your worksheets...
...your notes, your...
- I can't.
They'd know where you got it in five minutes.
Look, if it's... If it's your job you're worried about...
...Winterchem will find you something.
- You don't understand.
All...
All I knew was that Borough National was in trouble, that it had...
...something to do with this account and some Arab Eurodollars.
But...
...what I didn't know was how big this must be.
How desperate they are to keep it all secret.
Because...
...when I started to follow up on it...
...I was told that...
...it was a confidence factor...
...that 21214 was a sensitive area. And...
- What?
- Well...
...I got offered a loan...
...at a very low interest.
A bribe...
...which I took.
God help me.
So...
So, Mrs. Winters, we're not just talking about my job.
- We're talking about prison or worse.
- Worse?
Mrs. Winters, please, just leave it.
I can't leave it. I need your proof.
Your husband couldn't leave it, and look what happened to him.
Charlie?
Are you...? Are you saying this had something to do...
...with Charlie's death?
- I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know.
I can't be sure.
But he found out, and he died, didn't he?
Mrs. Winters, Mrs. Winters, they're all over me, and I... I...
If I tell them you came to see me, what happens to you?
And if I don't, what...?
What happens to...? To me? l...
I thought...
I thought it was all over when I took the bribe.
But it's never gonna end...
...is it?
Mrs. Winters.
There's a Dunkin' Donuts in the Rockville Shopping Center.
I'll meet you there at 4:00.
I'll need some time to get my notes.
This is going to be over, Mr. Fewster.
I promise you.
It's gonna end.
All right. Stand by.
- Hello, Mr. Smith.
- Sam...
...I left some papers up in Mr. Emery's office.
- No problem. I'll sign you in.
- Thanks.
- Anything up?
- No.
Have a good night.
That's one of the rewards of working at night, no phone calls.
- Good evening, Henry.
- Evening, Mr. Emery.
You've got a hectic week ahead of you, there's the IMF conference. Johnson's...
That's one of his problems.
We take count.
Europe development speech is next Thursday.
Not this year. Mrs. Emery's taking care of the Girl Guides.
That's enough scouting.
Tell George that when he writes...
...that community trust speech he can forget Adam Smith.
I know it was enough.
I don't understand how we could've been so wrong on interest rates.
Warren went long on bonds again, tried to cover himself.
I'll accept his being wrong but not his refusal to admit it.
- You gonna talk to him about it over lunch?
- A drink should do it.
Maybe Chase can afford him. We can't.
- Just part of the image.
- What about that little list of yours?
- I'm not gonna need you tonight, William.
- Yes, ma'am.
Hub?
Hey.
I'd just about given up on you.
- Oh, thank God you're home.
- Yeah, where you been?
- Oh, just hold me.
- Oh, I was getting worried about you.
- Just hold me.
- Tell me if you're okay.
Something awful happened in Washington.
What were you doing in Washington?
It was an accident. You know, one of those close calls.
I feel so silly.
I think I need a drink.
While you're at it, get one for me.
Scotch on the rocks with a twist.
Mr. Emery there? Hub Smith calling.
No. This won't keep. Can't you find him?
Look, I have to talk to him.
If he calls in, tell him...
Tell him we've got to talk about 21214...
...before anything else happens.
That's right...
I can't speak for the president of the United States.
He runs his shop. I run mine.
But I'll tell you this.
Bankers are more dependable than governments.
We don't lie to ourselves.
We can't afford to.
Isn't that right, Hub?
I'd like to think so.
We've just been joined by a most distinguished banker.
About 20 years ago, he sat where you are...
...drinking in my words with the same skepticism that I see on some of your faces.
How do you account for the fact that for 30 years after the Depression...
...there hasn't been a single major bank failure?
Now there's one every 18 months.
Herstatt in Germany.
Franklin National here.
The international character of banking today makes everyone vulnerable to everything.
Somebody sneezes in Zurich, we say gesundheit in New York.
The important thing to realize is...
...that everything is interconnected.
We're all in this together.
- This is Hub Smith with Borough National.
- Professor Aikens, it's a pleasure.
Will you excuse us for a few minutes?
I'll catch up with you later.
Well, you're a surprise.
People will start talking about us, fella.
What are you doing?
As a matter of fact, right now
I'm trying to keep my temper.
See, after that flutter we had at Borough National yesterday...
...there was one Saudi Eurodollar deposit that didn't roll over.
It was transferred instead to First New York.
So I went over and had a little talk with your computer about that stray 5 million.
You set me up, Max.
You didn't want me to save Borough National.
You just wanted me to keep them afloat for you to siphon off that Arab money.
You've been doing it for months.
Is that a fact?
Don't dance with me, Max.
You have 21214 listed as a foreign-exchange account.
But you don't buy other currency with those dollars. You buy gold.
But you have to do it slowly because if anybody finds out what's going on...
...the dollar will drop, and all the Saudi investments over here won't be worth shit.
You're being a little wild and woolly here, aren't you, fella?
There have been some perfectly normal transactions...
...that wouldn't raise an eyebrow anywhere.
Borough National is just the tip of the iceberg, isn't it, Max?
I checked the inflows in 21214.
There are billions coming in on a regular basis...
...from Arab and OPEC accounts you control in at least 15 other banks.
You're moving the Arabs into gold.
- You're taking them out of the dollar.
- That isn't a crime.
It isn't against the law.
It isn't even a conspiracy.
Just a routine banking operation.
And if we didn't handle it, they'd find a lot of other people who would.
Goddamn it, Max.
You don't just do this on your own.
You go to the Comptroller of the Currency...
...the Federal Reserve Board, the secretary of the Treasury.
- You call the president, for chrissake.
- And start a real panic?
Have you ever seen anyone in government keep his mouth shut...
...about anything for five minutes?
Go ahead. Call the Treasury.
Call the Comptroller. But I'll tell you what's going to happen.
When the Arabs learn that word of what they're doing is out, they may panic...
...move a big chunk of funds too fast or the wrong way.
Really destabilize the monetary markets.
Then the dollar will collapse.
Whereupon there'll be a lot of jawboning by the president, and that won't work.
Then they'll go to selling gold, and that won't work either.
Then they'll have to go to capital controls. Freeze foreign assets...
...stop any money from going in or out, and that will be the end of all the markets.
That will really be the finish. Then you'll see a worldwide depression that'll...
...make the 1930s look like a kindergarten.
In two months, you'll have breadlines in Detroit, riots in Pittsburgh.
In six months, you'll see grass right over Rodeo Drive.
And Michigan Boulevard and Fifth Avenue.
And I won't have done it, Hub, you will.
All because you tried to stop a movement that couldn't be stopped anyway.
Listen to me, Hub.
Money, capital has a life of its own.
It's a force of nature, like gravity.
Like the oceans.
It flows where it wants to flow.
This whole thing with the Arabs and gold is inevitable. We're just going with the tide.
The only question is...
...whether you want to let it go like an unguided missile and raise hell...
...or whether you want to keep it in the hands of responsible people.
Keep it channeled, keep it quiet.
Believe me, Hub.
The dollar will hold. Believe me.
The system will be fine, providing nobody panics.
I'm looking at you, Hub.
Well...
...l've listened patiently to your somewhat fantastic story...
...with one puzzling question in mind.
If you wish to say something to the Arabs, say it.
Why come to me?
Because you know how to get to them.
Sometimes. If they wish to be gotten to.
And exactly what is it I'm to tell them?
That I...
...know that they're involved in a secret financial manipulation...
...and that they want it kept secret.
And so I'm prepared to trade,
Mr. Naftari, my silence...
...in exchange for Winterchem.
But you have Winterchem.
Our contract has to be renegotiated...
...so that if Borough National goes under...
...I don't lose my company to the Saudis.
My silence is the only leverage I have.
Forgive me...
...but silence about what?
Some secret financial manipulation?
You expect them to believe me if I use those words?
Just tell them 21214.
You realize, of course, that they may reject your whole story as preposterous.
They may not even wish to discuss it.
I'll take my chances.
If they don't get back to me, they'll have to take theirs.
There's something else they should know.
While I've spoken to no one about this...
...l've taken the precaution of putting the evidence I have in a safe place.
Very well, then. I will pass it on.
I so enjoyed your work in films,
Mrs. Winters.
What a pity you decided to give it up.
Hello?
Sorry, partner, I missed the damned 5:00 shuttle from Boston.
I just got into LaGuardia.
Why don't you go ahead.
I'll catch up with you at the opera.
Listen, you're tired.
Why don't you just finesse it.
It's only a benefit.
Well, I am pretty whacked.
Go on home. I'll call you tomorrow.
- You swear?
- In blood.
Hey, maybe we can get off somewhere by ourselves this weekend.
Just the two of us. Alone.
- Call me. Okay?
- Okay.
Nettie, first thing tomorrow I want all the locks in the house changed.
Changed my mind.
Mrs. Winters is not here.
That's okay, Nettie, I'll wait for her.
- Hello?
- Is Mrs. Winters there?
I'm afraid she's out for the evening.
Well, then could you give her a message, please? I'm calling on behalf of Mr. Naftari.
He asked me to say he's been in touch with the other party...
... in regards to the 21214 matter, as Mrs. Winters requested.
And they suggest a meeting at 11 tomorrow.
Eleven tomorrow. I'll tell her.
Hi, Mr. Smith.
Excuse me.
Okay, what the hell have you been playing with Sal?
I have nothing to say to you.
What do you know about 21214?
- Enough.
- Enough what?
Enough to protect myself.
- Against what?
- Against you.
Borough National can go under.
You're not taking me with it.
I'm through depending on you, Hub.
I went to the Saudis.
I'm cutting my own deal.
Sorry, partner.
I guess I just lost confidence.
- Do you know what you've done?
- What I've done?
- Smile.
- What?
Smile.
I have to go. Have a nice evening.
Leave me alone.
Get out! It's not your driver! Get out!
Get out! He's not your driver!
Get out!
Lee, are you all right?
I didn't know.
I swear to God, I didn't know.
Yes, Emery here.
What? Not possible. They couldn't.
Everything that goes to them clears through me, personally.
I'm afraid the matter is out of my hands now, Mr. Emery.
Whatever they're planning is out of yours too.
- It's not the children?
- No, no. Business.
Absolute nonsense.
Okay.
The Arabs yanked every penny they had with us.
They hit all the other outfits too, so it's across-the-board.
Every bank in the country is gonna be struggling for liquidity...
...trying to cover those cash withdrawals.
We're dumping everything.
Treasury bills, bonds, Fannie Maes, commercial papers, we want it all sold.
Fed Funds, Eurodollars, borrow whatever you can find up to 200 million.
Foreign exchange, no positions.
Bullion, grab what you can get.
All right, let's hit it...
...and pray.
Maybe we could try to borrow in Frankfurt...
...or Zurich.
Swiss International owes us a favor.
It's over, Roy.
Twenty-nine percent for three-month money with no nibbles.
- We may have to go to 30.
- The market's starting to react already.
One large bank is bidding 27 percent for six-month Eurodollars.
Dollar down 4 percent against the sterling.
I'm running low on contracts.
I need contracts!
One thousand!
Gold jumped $ 100 in 30 seconds.
Dollar down by 5 percent against the franc.
Borrowers stepping up the bids.
Fed doing another round of repos at 30 percent.
The customers wanna know what's happening.
Do I tell them what we're doing?
Tell them anything, Barney, except what we're doing!
Stock market's off 75 points.
The dollar's depreciated 10 percent and moving down.
They even yanked the Eurodollar deposits that weren't due.
First New York is practically down the tubes, and gold just went over 2000.
By tonight, that'll be cheap.
Hi, Virginia. It's me.
I want you to listen and listen very carefully.
As soon as you hang up,
I want you to go to the closet...
...take the suitcase and get to the bank.
It began eight days ago when a group of Arab investors...
... withdrew billions of dollars from U.S. banks.
That, in turn, started a chain reaction on the world money markets.
Dollars, pounds, marks, francs, yen, not one currency escaped.
This scene, outside a Manhattan bank was duplicated all over the world...
... as people saw their life savings become worthless...
... in a matter of hours.
Good evening. I'm George Page in New York.
And this is another in our series of reports on the world economic crisis.
The growing paralysis of the industrial world...
... has left millions without jobs, without money...
... and without hope.
Crowds of unemployed poured into Washington yesterday.
They stood in silent protest before the nation's leaders.
At the same time, more than a million people packed St. Peter's Square...
... where the pope urged calm and nonviolence.
The pontiff asked for prayers for world leaders...
... prayers and peace and reason.
But the last 24 hours have been marked by growing protests...
... and ever-increasing violence.
Last night, demonstrators burned
American currency...
... in front of the White House.
And attempts to put out the fires led to a confrontation with police.
Every hour, from every corner of the globe...
... there are new reports of outraged crowds demanding action.
A bankrupt world seems to be teetering...
... on the very edge of anarchy.
And now for continued coverage from around the world.
A statement was issued from the OPEC meeting today...
... that the leading oil-producing nations would resume oil exports...
... as soon as the international monetary markets have stabilized.
The panic has spread across political and philosophical boundaries.
The U.S.S.R. and the developed
Eastern European Communist countries...
... dependent on Western trade and capital...
... have witnessed the same riots that have taken place in the West.
The economic summit conference will be attended by leaders...
... of the West, the East and the Third World.
Said one, "There is a need for unity of purpose and resolve...
... unequaled since the end of World War II. "
At this time of crisis, there has been a turning to the past as well as the future.
Words spoken by Franklin D. Roosevelt in the depths of the Depression...
... were quoted in the Senate today.
"This is preeminently the time to speak the truth...
... frankly and boldly.
Nor need we shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country today.
This great nation will endure as it has endured...
... will revive and will prosper.
We face our common difficulties. They concern, thank God, only material things.
Each age is a dream that is dying...
... for one that is coming to birth. "
I've been worried about you.
How are you?
Like everybody else.
Looking for a way to begin again.
You're gonna need a partner.
[ENGLISH]
I don't know how you talked me into this, Tommy.
Hell, I must be crazy, heh.
You know... if the institution ever found out about this... they would haul our butts back in in straitjackets.
- Permanent.
- You didn't have to come, Hawes.
- This is between me and Jason.
- I know, I know, I know.
But I still don't get the therapy here.
All you need to know is
Jason's dead, right, heh?
Seeing his corpse ain't gonna stop the hallucinations.
Seeing it won't, but destroying it will.
Jason belongs in hell, and
I'm gonna see he gets there.
Okay, there it is, huh, heh?
There's his grave.
- Okay, let's go.
- Wait a second.
What?
I gotta be sure.
Okay. There's your proof.
There's his coffin. Let's go.
- Hand me the crowbar.
- You're not gonna open that.
Hand me the crowbar.
I got it.
I really don't like this.
Die!
- Die!
- Tommy!
Die!
- Tommy!
- Die!
Tommy. Tommy, get the hell out of here!
Where are you going?
Hey, what's that for?
Tommy, what are you doing?
Oh, shit.
Oh, boy.
He must've really messed you over.
Yeah, fuck you, Jason.
What are you doing?
Tommy. Would you just leave that thing alone?
Please.
Tommy, please. Let's get out of here.
My heart can't take any more of this.
Hawes!
- Don't shoot. Please.
- You in show business, kid?
- You sure know how to make an entrance.
- Look, you gotta do something.
Jason's alive. He killed my friend,
- now he's coming for me.
- You better cool out, boy.
- You almost got your head blown off.
- Will you listen, dammit?
Don't piss me off, junior or I will repaint this office with your brains.
Look, Jason is alive.
We dug up his body.
- I was gonna cremate it.
- Hold it. What's your name, son?
Tommy Jarvis. But look, we've gotta do something.
He's even more powerful now...
Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were killed by that maniac?
Yeah. Jason murdered them.
You've been in some psychiatric clinic ever since.
What the hell's going on with the weather?
- Sorry. I didn't know you had...
- No problem, Rick.
I want you to meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis.
- He's got some kind of prank...
- There's no time for this bullshit!
- Jason's gotta be stopped!
- What prank, Mike?
- Hey. Hey!
- Unh!
That's what's known in the books as
"screwing the pooch." Iron this punk.
No, wait. You gotta listen to me.
Jason's coming here. He's after me!
- I tried to destroy him, but I fucked up.
- You got that right, punk.
You listen to me. I'm sorry about what happened to you and your folks years ago... but no one in Forest Green wants to be reminded... of what that maniac did here.
That's why we changed the name.
People wanna forget this was Crystal Lake.
They don't need some kid stirring up Jason shit again.
Now, you just lie down and get some rest.
- In the morning, I'll call that clinic.
- No.
If you just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
Either you get some sleep, or I'm gonna come in there and put you out.
You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
You're gonna be sorry if you don't shut up.
Take a nap, junior.
Take it easy. It's hard enough to read this thing.
- Well, who told me to take this cowpath?
- Wait a minute.
You admit the sign did say Camp Forest
Green with an arrow pointing this way?
I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
I told you we should've left a trail of bread crumbs.
Don't start.
So much for the head counselors ever getting back to the camp on their own.
I say we stop the car, get out and start screaming for help.
- I was just kidding, Lizbeth.
- Darren, we'd better turn around.
- Why?
- Because I've seen enough... horror movies to know any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly.
Whoa!
There's no way that we can do this.
If the car drops into that gully, we'll never get it out.
Do you have a better suggestion?
Yeah.
We're gonna scare him.
- We're gonna scare him?
- That's right.
Just drive towards him. He'll move.
- Nobody wants to die.
- Well, that's a freaking fact.
- Least of all us.
- Just drive.
He'll get out of our way.
Yeah. That really scared the shit out of him.
- Oh, no.
- That's it.
We're driving this baby back to town in reverse.
The hell we are.
- Where'd you get that?
- Don't worry about it.
- Just stay cool.
- Stay cool?
You ain't Dirty Harry.
Now, stop it.
All right, scumbag.
Get out of the road.
Now.
Darren, get back in here right now. He'll kill you.
Not if I get him first.
No, no.
No!
Please.
Please, wait a second.
Please. Take these...
Please.
You can have the...
Come on, Dad. You can at least have Rick drive out... and look for them.
Megan, my deputy has more important things to do... than look for camp counselors with car trouble.
Come on. Can't you put out an all points bulletin?
- That would be wicked decent.
- Your mother own a sewing machine, kid?
- Excuse me?
- Hey, off.
Oh, hey. Sorry.
Darren and my sister
Lizbeth are in charge... of organizing the new campgrounds and we don't know what to do.
And all the kiddies arrive today.
We're not ready to deal with that.
I sympathize with you kids.
Best I can do is call the station in
Carpenter and have them keep a lookout.
I've got a bad feeling what might've happened.
Hopefully they're fine, but with Jason out there...
- Shut up.
- Jason who?
Megan, stay away from him.
He's dangerous.
I'm not dangerous.
Jason is out there.
He's looking for me. He's probably headed back to the camp.
I told you to shut up.
You mean the Jason of Camp Blood?
- Yes.
- No.
You kids better leave.
This boy is not well and I need to talk to him in private.
- Come on, Dad. We were just...
- Megan.
Take your friends back to the camp.
I'll let you know if I hear anything about your camp leaders.
Don't beat him up too bad. He's cute.
Megan, leave.
Ooh. He's cute.
I was gonna call that clinic and have them collect your ass but I don't want you here any longer, poisoning my daughter or anyone else, with your warped sense of humor.
They have to be warned, sheriff. Jason will return to the area that's familiar.
No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him.
We're gonna escort you to the edge of my jurisdiction.
Then we will say goodbye and we'll never see you around here again.
Do we understand each other?
Shit. Shit. Damn.
I know I'm gonna get blamed for this.
Say old Martin ain't a good caretaker.
Hell, I'm a damn high school graduate.
And I deserve this job.
I earned it.
Nobody's gonna find out.
Shitheads couldn't even stick him back in right.
Well, I ain't gonna touch the slimy sucker.
Why'd they have to go and dig up Jason?
Some folks have a strange idea of entertainment.
Hey, you guys. You guys,
I'm getting worried.
- About Jason? Ooh.
- No, about Darren and Lizbeth.
They should've at least called, don't you think?
- Megan?
- What?
- Hello?
- Yeah, heh.
This girl's back in the jail cell with her prisoner of love.
Aw. Ha, ha.
Don't be messing with no crazy jailbird, girl.
- Those dudes are bad news.
- Oh, and how do you know?
I been around long enough to see plenty on TV.
- TV?
- Yeah. Heh.
I don't know about that guy, Megan.
He seemed pretty weird with all that Jason stuff.
You know what you need? I've been telling you this forever. You need a guy like me, eh?
- Guy who's not so twisted.
- Maybe he was telling the truth.
Just because our parents keep telling us... that Jason was only a legend doesn't mean it wasn't true.
What if he did come back here... looking for the camp counselor that caused him to drown as a boy... searching for the one that decapitated his vengeful mother?
And you do know what today's date is, don't you?
And I can think of only one thing even more terrifying.
What?
The kids are here.
Yeah, right!
Be careful. You may fall.
Here they are.
And they're all yours.
Think I'd rather deal with old Jason.
Once we nail Roy, that's it. Victory is ours.
It's taking forever. I'm starving.
That's your trouble, Larry.
That's why your sales are always behind quota.
Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
- You're a real ass, you know that?
- Better than being all ass.
- Oh. That is so unfair.
- Oh, here we go with unfair again.
- War is not fair.
- Give me a break, would you, please?
- This is not war. This is a game.
- War is an ugly thing.
- I'm hungry. I wanna get a sandwich.
- Wait till we kill something, then you can eat.
Calm down, would you?
- You're an insurance salesman.
- Death is my business.
You become this whole other person when we're out here, Stan.
- I don't like it.
- Hey, this is a man's game.
Requires a man's cunning.
A man's intelligence...
Fuck!
- With a woman's touch.
- Now, wait a minute!
- I thought Burt shot you!
- See any paint?
Sorry, guys. I did in Mr.
Commando, weapons and all.
Survival's the name of the game and that flag is mine.
I can't believe this.
Burt never gets shot.
- Never should've let her play.
- It's a damn company exec game... and she's a damn company exec.
Now, now, boys. Don't be spoilsports.
Put on your headbands.
Dumb broad. She tricked me.
God, they're gonna laugh for months.
She should've stayed in the kitchen where she belongs.
A woman shouldn't even be allowed in these games.
It's not a game. It's life.
Jason really screwed up that poor son of a bitch's mind.
He really believes that Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
That's not what worries me.
It's how far he'll go to try and prove it.
Darn.
Oh, no.
No.
Oh, my God. No.
What...? Come...
Where...? Oh, no. Oh, no. God.
Come on out, you guys!
The game's over.
You don't know. What about Roy?
- Nobody's seen him.
- Of course not.
If he hasn't accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
- Well, the game's not over till it's over.
- That's right.
Shh.
Wait a second. What was that?
- What?
- Nothing.
I could swear I heard something.
- I'm hungry.
- Oh, God.
Be quiet.
Oh, my God. My God.
Help, guys! Help me!
Help!
Oh, no. Help me, guys! Help!
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, God. Help me. Somebody help me!
He's gonna kill me.
Fucking-A, what did I tell you?
Hit the noise and the cherries.
Sheriff. Sheriff, wait.
- You gotta listen.
- I'm tired of listening to you, kid.
I gotta... I gotta show you Jason's grave.
I've seen it. Come on, get up!
- Get up!
- Please, sheriff.
You'll see we dug it up.
Well, he must've got chilly in the night and pulled the dirt back over.
That's not right.
Somebody covered it over.
- I gotta see it.
- Freeze it, psycho.
Now see what you've done.
You made my deputy draw his revolver.
He's been dying to try out his mail-order laser scope.
Wherever the red dot goes, you bang.
- What's the problem, sheriff?
- No problem, Martin.
Just a vagrant kid.
We got it under control.
- Did you cover up Jason's grave?
- What are you talking about?
Don't concern yourself.
This kid needs treatment.
Jason's not in his grave,
Hawes is. Dig it up!
You gotta dig it up!
You gotta dig it up!
Dig him up?
Does he think I'm a farthead?
Yeah!
Okay. Is this gonna be the best weekend ever?
Yeah!
- Are we gonna go fishing?
- Yeah!
- Are we gonna scare all the boys?
- Yeah!
Okay. Are we gonna, uh...?
Are we gonna not eat
Brussels sprouts?
- Yeah!
- What happened to Cort?
Are you ready?
He's taken the young men off to teach them my favorite sport.
- Heh, which is?
- Boy Scouting, honey.
Heh. Cort? You've gotta be kidding.
You gotta be kidding.
Listen, you obviously don't know anything about Indians.
Probably none of you do. Look, here's the story. These are called Indian markers.
Let's just say you have a chief, all right?
And he dumps his squaw or his wife or whatever.
He decides, "I'm gonna pick up with another woman and take off with her."
He takes off, leaving his son with the mother.
A week or two later, the son wants to catch up with his dad.
He wants to learn how to shoot a bow, kill a buffalo.
So, what happens is he comes along... sees the rocks, says, "Dad, he went that way," obviously.
He knocks them all down before the mother catches up... because he doesn't wanna see any of her anymore.
Pretty much, that's the basic story. It tells you where to go.
If this is exciting as it gets, we're in big trouble, dude.
Let's go.
Like the sign says, you are now leaving Forest Green.
Don't forget to buckle up.
You are damn lucky, kid.
With all the grief you've given me... you should be leaving wearing your balls as earrings.
And if I ever see you around here again, you can guarantee it.
Let's get the hell out of here, Rick.
Take you home again, Kathleen
To where...
Your heart will feel no pain
I'll take you home again
Steven, it's beautiful.
God, I love it. I really do.
I don't know. I mean, you know, I'm sort of hurt.
You thought I brought you up here just to... Ah, never mind.
Yeah, well, I guess I do owe you.
Yeah. No, look. I have a headache and I've been working out.
- Mm-hm. Ah.
- I'm... I'm sore...
- And...
- Yeah. Right. Forget about it.
Well, it's a messy act and...
- What the heck.
- Great.
Again, Kathleen
Oh.
Where'd the road go?
I can't find the road.
Where's the road?
Kathleen, you led me astray.
What's that? What's that?
Huh?
Darling, you're gonna be the death of me.
Yeah, but what a way to go, huh?
- Stay here.
- Steven, please.
- Stay here.
- No, Steven. Don't.
Steven. Steven, what's going on?
- Annette, let's go.
- Okay.
Never mind.
- What are we gonna do?
- We gotta get to the sheriff's office.
- Pick a card.
- I don't wanna play anymore, Sissy.
- Oh, come on. Pick a card.
- No, I really don't.
Okay. Okay. I've got a great game.
It's called Camp Blood.
- Great.
- Yeah.
The object of the game is, first you take this jack of spades... which is Jason, right?
And then you have all these face cards, which represent counselors.
The queen of hearts is me.
- Now, who do you wanna be?
- Oh, come on, Sissy.
Okay, you be the queen of diamonds.
What you do is you shuffle Jason up in these cards here... and you put them in piles, because the piles represent cabins.
Now, the object of the game is to find out which cabin Jason is in.
Did Megan say when she's coming back?
Of course not. You wanna bet she took him... a loaf of bread with a saw hidden in it?
I'm gonna call her.
Hopefully her dad has found out what's happened to Darren and Lizbeth.
I say if they're not here by morning, we send the kids home.
We're not prepared to run this...
- She saw a monster!
- Who did?
- It's okay. We're here.
- Yeah, honey, we're here.
- So, what happened?
- There was this monster.
And he was after me and he wanted to kill me.
- Where?
- He was everywhere.
- Oh, you mean you had a bad dream.
- No.
It was real, just like on TV.
Okay, listen, sweetie.
What's your name?
- Nancy.
- Well, Nancy...
I'm Paula, remember?
And this is Sissy.
And we're gonna be right out there all night so nothing can hurt you. Okay?
So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?
Good. Okay, lay down.
There. Okay?
Okay.
Hey, wait a minute, where's Cort?
I haven't seen him for hours.
I don't know. He called somebody, then he just took off.
Said something about checking out things that go bump in the night.
You're the best. The best.
You gotta keep it up to the end of this song.
How much longer?
It's only 10 more minutes.
- Fuck!
- Oh, yeah.
Wait a sec and I'll...
Cort, you didn't already?
Oh, come on, wasn't that the end of the song?
Great, just great.
If this thing is burned out, frigging
Horace is gonna have my butt.
- Who's Horace?
- My frigging stepfather... and asshole in residence.
Ah. Now, how'd that happen?
What?
Will you go out and plug the cord back in?
- Who unplugged the cord?
- Smokey the Bear. I don't know. Go do it.
- Do you know how cold it is out there, Nikki?
- I don't give a shit, Cort. Go do it!
You're a real pain in the ass.
A major pain in the ass.
Will you hurry up? I gotta get this back before Horace finds out I took it.
Hurry up.
- Will you come on?
- All right.
I'm going. I'm going, okay?
God, shut the hell up.
- What...?
- Cort.
- Nikki.
- What are you doing?
- Look at this.
- What happened to it?
I don't know, but I say unless you wanna look exactly like it... we make this place a memory right now.
Nikki, somebody's out there.
- What if it's that guy Jason?
- I don't wanna know.
- No way. This isn't happening.
- You're right, it isn't.
- You gonna drive or not?
- Whoo! Out of here.
Shit! Damn it, Cort.
Shit!
Go!
Shit! Cort!
Whoo! Boy, this baby jams.
Let me tell you, for a big truck, it's not bad at all.
That's it! Pull over, I'm driving.
No way, babe, I wanna rock!
Yeah! Whoo.
Whoo. This is... This is great!
I've never driven a house before.
I like this. This is great.
Sounds like you're having fun back there.
What are you doing? Need some company?
Ooh, that sounds great.
Do you need some company or what, huh?
Cort!
Whoo! This is great. I am having such a good time.
Ha, ha. This is great!
Hey, Nikki, what are you doing back there, taking a dump?
Mind if I come back and snatch a peek?
Or vice versa?
Whoo! Yeah!
Nikki, listen to this.
What makes you so high and mighty?
You keep forgetting, little
Megan, I'm the parent.
You're the child.
When are you gonna stop treating me like one?
When you stop acting like one.
Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy.
Oh, how do you know, Dad? What'd you do, take his temperature?
Better watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
"If your mother were still alive..."
That's it. Out. I don't need this tonight. Out, Megan.
Sheriff's office.
Oh, I'm sorry, he can't come to the phone right now.
He's in the can draining his lizard.
May I take a message?
Oops, here he comes now. Please hold.
- It's Rick.
- What?
- What kind of problem?
- You better get the hell down here.
I found what's left of those counselors... and it looks like someone did them in using Jason's old MO.
I knew I should have done something about that son of a...
Where are you?
- Right, I'm on my way.
- What is it?
Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
- I thought Jason was just a legend.
- That's right.
Only, Tommy wants to prove the legend is true.
Now, you stay put.
And I'm not kidding.
Sheriff's office.
I'm sorry, he's not in.
Can I take a message?
Oh, hi. This is his daughter, Megan.
I met you this morning, remember?
Yeah, hi. Listen, I've gotta talk to your dad about... About Jason.
I've got a plan. But first I need to buy some supplies and...
Tommy, my father's out looking for you right now.
Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible for it.
- If he finds you, he's gonna...
- Yeah, he made that real clear.
Megan, Jason is out there.
I'm positive he's headed back to the camp. He's gonna...
- Where are you? I'll come pick you up.
- What?
It's the only way. If my father sees you in your car... he's gonna nail you in a second. Where are you?
Uh, Karloff's General something, um...
I know just where it is. I'll see you in a half-hour, heh. Whoo!
Megan.
- Okay, lift it, ugh.
- Ugh.
I want all officers, units and stations within a 50-mile radius...
- alerted about this wacko kid.
- Yes, sir.
You have his vehicle description.
I want roadblocks.
- Sheriff, get over here!
- Shit, now what?
Come on.
Mike, over here.
Is that all you found?
I wish it was.
I'll order up some body bags.
Our boy sure wants us to believe his story.
Well, he picked the right day to pull this shit.
What do you mean?
Happy Friday the 13th.
All right, who's out there?
What's going on?
Think I hear somebody fooling around out there.
It's gotta be Cort. You know how he loves to try and scare us, heh.
Teach him a lesson.
You guys, try not to wake the kids.
I'm gonna borrow your car.
You can't do this.
It's too dangerous.
You gonna talk about dangerous?
You wanna leave that truck in plain sight?
Hide it behind the store and let's get out of here.
Look, this isn't a game.
You're not going with me.
I'm already responsible for...
You said you needed some supplies, right?
- Yes, but I...
- Then let's get going.
We can argue about it on the way.
Tell me what you need and I'll get it.
- Megan...
- Besides, nobody drives this puppy but me.
Now, hide that heap and let's book.
- Can't this tub go any faster?
- You got it.
- You just keep your eye out for roadblocks.
- Okay. There's one.
Get down.
Hey! Hey!
Unit 45, Officer Pappas to
Sheriff Garris, do you copy?
- Yeah.
- We've got a different vehicle... that took off when they saw us.
I saw somebody duck down.
- Got a description or plates?
- I got the whole enchilada.
It's a '77 orange Camaro. License number Mary, William, 85-10.
That's my daughter's car.
Uh, how do you want us to proceed, sir?
With extreme care, asshole.
If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.
Please, don't do anything crazy.
I know what I'm doing. I got you your supplies, didn't I?
If I can just get us to
Cunningham Road, I can lose them.
Stay down.
Whatever you say.
That's what I want.
This is gonna be a hairy turn. Hang on.
Megan, step out of the car.
End of the line.
Oh, shit.
Paula, I can't sleep. I'm scared.
I saw someone at my window.
- Where did you get this?
- I found it outside.
Ah, you know what? Sissy and
Cort are playing jokes.
You know, trying to scare each other.
- Why?
- Well... because grownups think it's funny to be scared.
- What?
- Heh, never mind.
I can't believe it's that late. No one called.
- I better...
- Who you calling?
Why don't we go and find
Sissy and Cort first.
Then you can go to bed.
- Wait. What if they try to scare us?
- Well, we'll scare them right back.
- Okay, heh.
- Okay, heh.
Let's go. Let's find them.
I said, shut up!
All he's asking you to do is just check it out.
- You've got me where you want me.
- If I had you where I wanted you... they'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde.
Why don't you at least call the camp, make sure everything's all right.
We have, trying to track you down.
The phone there's disconnected.
- Doesn't that tell you something?
- Yeah, they should've paid their bill.
Sheriff.
You just sit tight, Jason.
As soon as the authorities...
- from Carpenter get here...
- Sheriff! You better take this.
Sheriff Garris.
What time?
I'll be right there.
- What's happened?
- Rick.
Keep an eye on this wacko.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
What's going on?
Make sure my daughter stays put. She's grounded.
Tell me!
They just found your friend Cort and some girl.
Her head was crushed in and Cort, he had a knife rammed through his skull.
No.
Tommy Jarvis is a psychopathic killer.
- He wants you to believe that...
- It was Jason.
Sheriff, when did it happen?
For God's sake, Meggie, stay away from him, please.
- What time did this happen?
- What difference does that make?
- What time?
- Eight-thirty, 9:00. Why?
Tommy was with me all that time, Dad.
Rick...
I'll call you from there.
Lock him up.
Okay, flash, into the cage.
I'm sure Sissy and Cort are back in their cabins by now.
So you just go back to sleep and don't worry.
But what if I get scared again?
Shh!
You know what I used to do when
I was a little girl and I got scared?
I would close my eyes and say a little prayer.
And you know what? Pretty soon, everything scary went away.
It worked for me. I bet it'll work for you too, heh.
- Good night.
- Good night.
See you in the morning.
Cort?
Sissy?
No!
- No.
- Yes.
So, what are you drawing?
So, what's it to you?
Pipe down, Jarvis!
I was just curious as to what she's drawing, is all.
There, you happy?
- No.
- Why?
Because it stinks.
- Okay, give it back.
- Come and get it.
I'll get it for you, babe.
Come and get it.
Give it back, punk!
Hey!
Hey, hey! Get your hands off her, animal.
You little turd! I ought to punch you silly.
Let him out of there, Rick.
Megan.
Don't clown around.
I'm not the one with the funny red nose.
Now, open the cell and let him out.
Meggie.
I'm not kidding.
You better do as she says... because wherever the red dot goes, you bang.
You son of a bitch!
You're really screwing up here, missy.
Don't do this, Megan!
Megan!
- I thought he took your key.
- He did.
- But I've got my hide-a-key.
- Not this time.
- Hey, wait a minute.
- I appreciate you getting me out... but I have to finish what I started here.
Come on, hot lips, let's go.
You drive, I'll navigate.
Let me know when we're about to blast into hyperspace. I'll fasten my seatbelt.
I got a bad feeling we're already too late.
Are you sure this is gonna work?
Why didn't we just bring the gun and blow him away?
The only way now to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place.
Where he drowned in 1957.
- Lake Forest Green.
- Crystal Lake.
Where this nightmare began.
Now I lay me down to sleep.
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.
Now I lay me down to sleep.
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.
- So, what's the story here?
- Why don't you boys nose around.
I gotta break the news to Megan's friends about what's happened.
- Holler if you see anything.
- Like what?
Anything that don't belong.
And don't wake the kids.
Come on, handsome.
Girls?
It's Sheriff Garris.
Hey!
Oh, my God.
All right, come on out of there.
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Come on out of there.
Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing running around out here?
- Now, you go on back to bed.
- No! No, there's a scary man!
Oh, what scary man?
No, no, no. It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. Everything's all right.
Everything's okay, honey. It's okay.
Come on, boys, let's go.
Come on, kids. Come on.
Now, I want you to listen to me very carefully.
I want you to all lie down on the floor under the beds.
Do not get up until I come back. Do you understand? Now, move, hurry. Come on.
Come on.
Fuck!
- See, they did show up.
- Yeah.
We'll have to take...
Megan, wait!
Oh, God. Dad! Daddy!
It's okay. It's me, Megan.
Don't be afraid. It's okay.
Shh, everything's gonna be all right. Don't be afraid.
- Is everyone okay?
- They're fine. They're fine.
It's okay. Everything's gonna be just fine, okay?
I'm gonna go find my daddy, the sheriff, and then we can all go home, okay?
Now, uh, go back and lie down where you were before... and stay there. Go ahead.
And we'll come back and get you.
I promise. Go lie down. Stay there.
What do you think?
I think we're dead meat.
Daddy!
Dad, answer me!
Dad, where are you?
Megan! Use your dad's radio! Call for help!
And an ambulance!
Oh, God.
Stop it!
Daddy, where are you?
Daddy, please come to help us!
Daddy!
Real dead meat.
So, what were you gonna be when you grew up?
Daddy, where are you?
Daddy! Come help us, please!
No, not her!
No!
Dad!
Dad, answer me!
Ouch.
You've gotta help me find my dad.
We need him to help us.
Hand me the padlock.
Aren't you listening to me?
Yes, and I said, hand me the padlock!
- Here! You're gonna be sorry.
- I hope not.
Megan.
Megan, get back to the cabin with the kids.
Megan, please!
- Wait a minute. You can't do this.
- Get back in there before it's too late.
Megan, no!
Megan!
Megan! Megan, no!
Jason!
Jason!
Jason, come on!
Come and get me! It's me you want, remember?
That's it. Come on, maggot-head. Come on!
Come on, maggot-head.
That's it, come on!
Tommy!
Get out of there!
Hurry!
Hey, asshole!
It's me you want, remember? Come on!
Come on, chickenshit.
Come on, I'm standing here waiting. Come on, you pussy!
No!
Is he killed?
Stay here.
All right! Yeah!
It's over.
It's finally over.
Jason's home.
You're with your baby
And you're parked alone on a summer night
You're deep in love but you're deeper in the woods
You think you're doing all right
Did you hear that voice?
Did you see that face or was it just a dream?
This can't be real, that only happens, babe,
On the movie screen
Oh, but he's back
He's the man behind the mask
And he's out of control
He's back
The man behind the mask
And he crawled out of his hole
You're swimming with your girl out on Lover's Lake
And the wind blows cold
It chills your bones but you're still on the make
That's a bad mistake
Ah, but the moon was full
And you had a chance to be all alone
But you're not alone
This is your last dance
And your last romance
Yeah, cos he's back
He's the man behind the mask
And he's out of control
He's back
The man behind the mask
And he crawled out of his hole
Oh, if you see him coming
Get away if you can
Just keep on running, run as fast as you can
He's a dangerous, dangerous man
And he's out tonight
And he's watching you
And he knows your house
No, don't turn out the lights
Yeah, cos he's back
He's the man behind the mask
And he's out of control
He's back
The man behind the mask
And he's after your soul
He's back
He's the man behind the mask
And he's out of control
He's back
The man behind the mask
And he's after your soul
He's back
He's the man behind the mask
And he's out of control...
MAN FACING SOUTHEAST
To My Father
Mirta... my love...
I fired twice, as we agreed.
There were two bullets left for me.
I put the revolver here and fired the other two shots...
Then I couldn't see anything.
I could only hear her moan.
She was suffering...
I wanted to help her, but there were no more bullets.
I couldn't see through the blood.
I heard her, but I didn't know where she was.
The blood gushed from me like water from a broken pipe...
She was gone.
We'd agreed to die together.
She had bought the gun.
I failed her.
How could it be?
You must help me.
He thinks I can help?
I fired twice...
A priest could help more.
There were two bullets left for me.
He'll never rid himself
of those images.
I'll sedate him.
Soon he'll disappear among the rest.
He'll be on more,
but he'll never be himself.
As we agreed.
How would he react if
I touched his hand?
She was moaning...
It would show affection,
tenderness.
My God... How he must need it.
But he can't expect that from me.
I put the revolver here and fired the other two shots.
Neither do I.
I could only hear her moan.
She was suffering.
Poor fool.
He doesn't realize
he's being punished.
A prolonged agony.
I wanted to help her, but there were no more bullets.
You didn't save yourself.
Welcome to Hell.
Don't worry, we'll help you.
Excuse me, Doctor. How many patients have you?
32, I think. You must know it.
- Check the registry.
- I have checked.
- There should be 32.
- Has someone escaped?
Just the opposite.
There's one too many.
I checked the other wards.
Everything's in order.
Nobody's missing.
No new patients have been admitted.
- When did you discover this?
- This morning.
- Which one?
- He must be outside.
He's in the chapel. He's a good man.
He comes from far away.
It's only a series of vibrations, but they have a good effect on the men.
Where does the magic lie?
In the instruments?
In the one that wrote it?
In me?
In those that hear it?
I cannot understand what they feel.
Yes, I can understand.
I just can't feel it.
Do you understand?
Excuse me. I am Rantes.
How did you get here?
To earth?
In a spaceship.
You're a Martian.
Doctor, that is an insult.
You are an intelligent man.
Do you always underestimate your patients like this?
Are you a patient?
No, but I'm not a Martian.
I come from far away... from another world.
It's pointless to explain.
You wouldn't believe me anyway.
But you came in a spaceship and landed right here... in our courtyard.
No.
Coordinates 34 degrees latitude south,
61 longitude west.
In a field, near a place called
Junin, I believe.
I shouldn't reveal so much information.
All right, Rantes, or whoever you are...
We're alone... We're not the police.
You're involved in something shady and want to hide out here.
You're not the first, who would look here, right?
Look, I don't care what you've done, but don't waste my time.
If you stay, I'll have to contact the police.
You know the best way to protect my mission?
Telling the truth.
Who's going to believe it?
And the best place to tell the truth is this.
Anywhere else, you know what would happen?
They would bring me here.
I would be back here telling you the same things.
If you're gone tomorrow, no one will say anything.
If you stay....
Do you know what you're in for?
I know the methods, all the methods that you humans use.
I think he's faking.
Tomorrow he may be gone.
If he stays, just in case, give him a sedative.
- What about his file, Doctor?
- Put...
Unidentified Flying Patient, until we find out his name.
Dr. Denis, this is
Dr. Gimenez's secretary.
I'm confirming the interview on Tuesday at 3.00.
Julio, it's Nolasco. I'm calling about the clinic. Give me a call.
Ciao, a hug.
Horrible machine, tell my Daddy when you see him that I called to tell him that
Saturday, when he comes to see us, to take Consuelo and me to see the Moscow Circus.
Buy the tickets.
Bye, machine.
A kiss to Daddy.
If Rantes was faking it, the lengths
that he went to made him sick.
He sat for hours without moving,
without blinking. Totally isolated.
Immersed in someplace, I began
to suspect that was too far away,
but not outwards, as he said,
but inwards.
Rantes, what do you do in the gardens?
You spend hours without moving.
I receive and transmit information.
I told you I need to learn your identity.
The police will come to take your fingerprints.
- I hope it doesn't bother you.
- No.
I would find that amusing.
It's just... if my prints should match someone who's dead, don't be scared.
Rantes, do you believe that could happen?
I mean, do you... believe that you could be dead and be here, in front of me?
Yes. Not in such simple terms, of course.
But... in reality most of these men are dead but they're here...
Sometimes in front of you.
They're dead in what way?
What do you think?
You are a sincere son of a bitch, a faking son of a bitch, which is even crazier.
My mother would find your statements amusing.
What's her name?
We have no mother. At least they never told us.
- You're a robot.
- No.
You are all robots.
You just haven't realized it.
All right.
I'm a robot. What are you?
- You wouldn't understand.
- Try me.
You are in the prehistory of the holograms.
Holograms?
Yes. A type of photograph obtained through a laser beam.
It's an experiment done in our physics laboratories.
We have been able...
How can I explain?
To have those images take shape in space through what you would call a large projector programmed with a highly complex computer to include the vital information for that image to be alive.
Let's see... You're telling me that you are a projection.
In a way.
I... my spaceship... We are as images projected in space.
I say ''images'' for your benefit, because, in reality, I could do without your eyes.
You could close them.
I'd still exist.
I breathe. You can touch me,
I can touch you.
We are perfect human replicas.
Except for one detail.
We cannot feel.
''I cannot feel. ''
That was one of the most
moving confessions.
I'd ever heard from a patient.
I hadn't been feeling much
for my profession.
I hadn't been so interested in a patient
in a long time.
And I hadn't been happy
in a long time.
Soon they would take his fingerprints.
I guessed that Rantes had been
a mathematician... maybe a physicist.
He had mentioned a physics laboratory.
This is a hologram.
The laser bounces off the object leaving its impression on the plate.
Then, to reconstruct the image we use another laser.
- Is this an experiment?
- It's a laboratory experience.
The object is registered indirectly on the photographic plate. Understand?
The hologram represents the object in code.
Could people be photographed and projected in space?
For example, projecting a person here so that person would seem reel?
It could be done with pulsating lasers, but it would just be the image of its outward appearance lacking all the other attributes of a real person.
Why assume that a person who talks
about physics must be a physicist?
He could just know about certain
phenomena and make up a story.
Who'd use such information for
non-scientific purposes? What is he?
A writer.
A writer.
A writer or just a reader.
Reader?
Why did I think that?
Reader of what?
Fiction was not one of my interests, but
in Rantes' description of holograms
had a literary feel to it.
Someplace I had read something similar.
That business of projecting human
beings... In some book...
and I had it.
''I began to find unknown waves
and vibrations
and devised instruments to capture
and transmit them. ''
''Here's the machine's first component. ''
''The second records,
the third projects. ''
''It doesn't require screen or papers. ''
''If you open all the receivers,
Madeleine appears, complete,
reproduced, identifiable. ''
''Remember that we refer to images
extracted from mirrors... with sounds...
resistance to touch, taste, the smells,
the temperature,
perfectly synchronized. ''
''Morel's Invention. ''
Adolfo Bioy Casares, 1940.
If Rantes had written his story
instead of telling me,
he could have become a famous writer,
instead of the lunatic
I hoped to unmask.
Okay. Rantes could have been
a physicist
or read ''Morel's Invention. ''
But what would that prove?
Take it easy.
There are only two alternatives.
Either Rantes is crazy or he's from another planet.
No, old man.
There cannot be
two alternatives.
- What is it?
- The report on Rantes' fingerprints.
- I don't understand.
- They're not on file.
He doesn't exist.
- Any explanations?
- A Uruguayan... who suddenly turned up here would have no records.
He always looks in the same direction.
He always orients himself in the same direction between the water tank and
Pavillion 6.
What direction is that?
- Which way is north?
- There.
Then he faces towards the south.
South...
- Southeast... right?
- Yes, southeast.
Southeast.
And why not southwest?
Or north?
- Southeast.
- What does he say?
That he receives and transmits information.
Whatever it is... on that line... there must be some clue to his past.
We're changing the medication for the patient in bed 7, Rantes.
He is delirious and he's not improving.
We'll try to depress him.
I want a daily report, O.K.?
He's a good man, he comes from far away.
Everyone seems to like you.
I thought about what you told me that you couldn't feel.
What about that?
Can we chat?
How about some coffee?
My projection includes all the information to do many things.
To play Bach... and other things that would surprise you.
To me, it's only information.
Why do psychiatrists lean back when they listen?
They think it's contagious?
Forgive me. It's just a habit.
Now, Rantes...
- You gave that patient your coat.
- He was cold.
What compelled you to give him your coat?
- He was cold.
- Stop bullshitting me, Rantes.
You felt something for that man.
No, it's a totally rational reaction.
If someone is cold, I help.
You're programmed for that.
- Do you have hallucinations?
- No, you do.
I'm one of your hallucinations.
You're a complete lunatic.
But you're a very special lunatic.
You worry me.
You really do.
I appreciate your worrying about me.
It's not customary to care about someone else here.
In this hospital?
On this planet.
What about yours?
Tell me about that.
Where did you live?
In a town?
In a city?
No data found. That information is unavailable. Ask again.
I don't want to deceive you.
I could describe any town, any city...
That would be deceiving you.
It wouldn't be a town as you understand it... nor would it be the past you're seeking.
You're my past... this moment... this world.
You want to take me to man's past.
But how could you understand that?
Relax, Doctor.
What's worrying you?
If I were a dictator and could command powerful armies, I could understand.
But I'm not.
I'm in an asylum.
Everyone knows that I'm crazy.
You, too, right?
Rantes, you're sick.
I'm a doctor.
I want to cure you, that's all.
I want you to understand me, not cure me.
Even though he didn't believe it,
I tried to understand.
In fact, it was becoming my life's main
objective to understand Rantes.
He passed every test, as expected.
Sticking to his crazy beliefs, each time
more complex, more perfect.
The intelligence test rated him
as a genius.
No analysis showed any
physical abnormality,
all the results indicated
he was healthy.
Except for one detail... he claimed
to come from another world.
- We're seeing the circus?
- No.
I didn't have time to buy tickets.
- Where are we going?
- To the zoo.
Again?
What are you doing?
Keep still.
Sit straight. Leave that alone.
Waiter!
Here.
One steak!
- The steak!
- What?
- My steak?
- I put it there.
- Where?
- I left it there.
People are waiting!
- Did you take it?
- Where?
Time went by.
Rantes became just another shadow.
One of many...
acknowledged only by the priest,
who now had an incredible organist.
Rantes didn't exist,
except for me.
No other doctor acknowledged him.
At that time I was the only witness
to his existence.
If Rantes was crazy,
he was crazy only for me.
His delirium didn't diminish.
Apparently, he had avoided
taking the anti-psychotics.
I could have injected him.
For some reason, I chose not to.
Rantes' delirium was harmless
and for the moment, perfect.
I just had to wait.
I was sure that, at any moment,
he would make a mistake.
I want to ask a favor.
Would you arrange for me to work in Pathology?
In Pathology? What would you do in Pathology?
Let's say... cleaning... maintenance.
I see, you're bored.
You want to use your hands.
- What about the handicraft workshop?
- No, Doctor.
What would you have me make?
Wooden boxes that read
''Souvenir from Nuthouse''?
I'm not bored. I want to work in Pathology.
You're my only friend with any power here.
Sending a lunatic to work in Pathology
would make you a lunatic.
The cleaning story is a good pretext.
That's the pretext.
What's the real motive?
To investigate.
- Investigate what?
- Man's brain.
- Your brain?
- No, your brain.
I hate to disappoint you.
All signs indicate your brain is exactly like mine or any other human's.
Then why are you considered sane and I'm considered insane?
He sure seems like he's from another planet.
He is a good man. Gentle.
O.K. Leave him with me.
On a conditional basis.
If he behaves, he stays.
He'll be useful.
It's the only way to get an assistant.
There's not even money for coffins.
The other day I sent out two corpse in the same box.
Behold... a genius.
I wonder what made him go nuts.
When he dies, I get the autopsy.
You're a son of a bitch.
Yes, it's mine.
- All these clippings...
- It's information.
- About what?
- About the world's deadliest weapon.
We know how to defend against your other weapons.
Not this one. It baffles us.
- What weapon, Rantes?
- Stupidity. Human stupidity.
Why do you say ''us''?
I'm not the only inhabitant of my planet nor am I the only one here.
For God's sake, Rantes, don't tell me there are others. You're plenty.
This same scene is happening all over the world.
Other Rantes facing other doctors like you in other nuthouses, having the same discussion at this very moment.
And we're all saying exactly the same thing.
Check it out. Call them.
Dr. de la Fuente, Madrid.
Dr. Lamarque, Lima.
You speak English? French?
If one of you would call, you could change history, but we know you won't.
It is beyond the limits of what you can accept.
We are beyond those limits.
O.K., if I accept all those doctors are talking to all the Rantes, what do these clippings mean?
The daily crimes.
If God is within you, you assassinate God every day.
How does this concern you?
We are preparing the rescue.
Do you see why a nuthouse is the safest place?
I can tell you this confidential information because nobody will believe it.
- What rescue?
- The rescue of the victims, those who cannot survive amidst the terror.
Those broken by the horror, those who are without hope... here.
It will not be robbery.
All you've left out are the words
''Blessed are the Meek''.
You made a mistake in assuming your role.
You say you are from another planet.
You should have said you were Christ.
My story might've been different but not your reaction.
Rantes, did you have children?
Why do you keep this?
They also cannot live with horror... and they die like ants.
International Operator, one moment, please.
International Operator, one moment, please.
An invasion of Christs
was an amusing idea.
God forgive me. The absurdity
of it amused me.
The old, official version of one Christ
always seemed absurd,
but it never amused me.
I didn't know why, but it was impossible
to get the thought out of my mind.
I wondered, if this were true,
why was that Christ a social being,
one with a political approach while
this one isolated himself completely?
Things had not gone well that time.
Perhaps this time they decided
to change their tactics.
My God! Rantes was probably right
in saying that psychiatrists lean back
to avoid being infected.
In his case, I had committed
the indiscretion of not doing it.
Sometimes a perfumed breeze comes through a window.
Does it call up some old memories?
I don't have memories that can be activated that way... but if I had them, certain smells, certain perfumes would harm me.
We have lost many agents that way.
- How's that?
- Agents... like me.
They feel things they are not programmed for and separate themselves from the beam.
They have deserted, why?
For things that you would consider stupid.
Perfume coming through a window, for example, a woman's fragrance, a catchy saxophone melody.
- A saxophone? Did you know I play the saxophone? - No.
But, please, Doctor, don't take me literally.
Don't show up with a saxophone to try to destroy me.
I don't understand something.
You talk about sensations... sensations that seriously upset the people of your planet.
Combinations are produced which make our computerized memory begins to malfunction.
We still do not know why.
That's why I asked to work in Pathology.
To investigate.
Why don't you stop bullshitting?
I will help you, I really will.
I know that you're afraid to see yourself as merely a man, as a sick man, but don't worry,
I will not abandon you.
But you have to help me.
You're a great guy, Rantes.
It's a pity.
You're a great guy, too, but you're not happy.
You know it, and it doesn't bother you.
Human beings resign themselves to so many destructive things.
They do nothing to change things.
Is it stupidity or are you paying for your sins?
Home again.
Rantes, it's still early.
How about some coffee?
Why should I be cured?
Can you give me a serious reason we can discuss here?
Rantes, if you're not a lunatic,
I would concede that you are an extraterrestrial.
That would mean that I'm a lunatic.
Nature allows only for very slow change accepting a change of species before a change of conscience.
I'm more rational than you.
I respond rationally to stimulus.
If someone suffers, I console him.
If someone needs my help, I give it.
Why do you think I'm crazy?
If someone looks at me, I respond.
If someone talks, I listen.
You have slowly gone crazy by ignoring those stimuli, simply for having ignored them.
Someone dies. You let him die.
Someone asks for help.
You look the other way.
Someone is hungry. You squander what you have.
Someone is dying of sorrow.
You lock him up so as not to see him.
One who systematically adopts this conduct, who walks among the victims, ignoring them, may dress well, may pay taxes, go to Mass, but you cannot deny he is sick.
Your reality is terrifying, Doctor.
Why don't you look at the real madness for once?
Stop persecuting the sad ones, the meek, those who don't want to buy, or cannot buy that shit you would gladly sell me.
That is, if you could.
Rantes had just made a move that
surprised me.
It seemed unprogrammed.
Unexpectedly, a rage
had surfaced in him.
He claimed to be a ''Cybernetic Christ'',
but his rage made him resemble
the other Christ, the old Christ.
At this stage, my thoughts were
confused somewhat by shame,
somewhat by anger.
Since Rantes was becoming more
Christ-like, his end would be the same.
I wouldn't admit it, but I wanted Rantes
to disappear completely.
Even though history would see me,
if this were true,
as the Pilate of the galaxies.
Even so, I would prefer,
as had many Romans,
to risk a resurrection rather than have
him here saying what he was saying.
Hey, Rantes has a visitor.
- Beatriz...
- Dick.
Rantes had been here for a while and he's made no progress.
We don't know his identity.
In the register, he's listed as N.N.
So your presence may be very useful.
That's why I intercepted you.
Now I'd like to ask you some questions.
They may seem indiscreet, but I think you'll understand.
- Are you related?
- No.
A friend?
We met a while ago.
I'm an evangelist.
I work in a church.
We do relief work in a village.
- That's where we met.
- In a church?
- Why was Rantes at the church?
- He showed up offering to help out.
At first, we didn't realize his importance.
Importance?
He knows everything.
He teaches the kids music.
He's delivered several babies very professionally.
He's assembling a machine using parts of radios and calculators.
He says it will be a computer.
From the beginning we found him a little strange, but a good man.
He told me his story.
- It was very moving.
- He explained why he's here?
He described his problems with alcohol.
Problems with alcohol?
What problems with alcohol?
He didn't tell me why.
I didn't ask.
He said he'd been an alcoholic.
He sought help to avoid harming anybody.
He said he was improving.
He spoke highly of you.
- He never mentioned coming from another planet? - No.
Ranted may have problems, but he doesn't seem crazy to me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, Doctor, but it is late.
Yes, of course.
Will you be visiting again?
I'd like to talk more.
Anything he said may help me.
- And him.
- Yes, of course.
Can I have your phone number?
I don't have a phone.
I'll give you my numbers.
You can call me here or at home.
Rantes deserves our help.
He's a valuable man.
You told me everything, eh?
The Saint?
She's a very interesting woman.
Why do you call her the ''Saint''?
Because she's a very special woman.
Her mechanisms are unlike other humans.
- What mechanisms?
- This is confidential... but I can trust you.
Uncommon connections between the emotional and the physical.
When a human being feels something what are the external physical reactions?
You can cry, or tremble, or pretend you don't feel a thing.
The Saint could never hide anything.
When she feels, when... she becomes deeply moved or feels love, I suppose, she regurgitates a blue liquid.
A blue liquid?
Yes. It's a very interesting case.
Searching for ways of decoding feelings and transforming them into information, it's truly an exceptional case.
Why the need to expel the liquid?
Why blue?
What produces it?
Perhaps she's epileptic and you imagined the liquid was blue.
What's wrong, Doctor?
Have you found yourself at the limits?
Crazy trees grow in nuthouses.
Why did you tell her you were an alcoholic?
An alcoholic?
I didn't want to frighten her.
I am interested in working with those people.
Telling the truth would ruin everything.
Horrible machine, tell Dad
I would like to go to fishing.
I deserve it since I got an A in school.
Bye, machine. I don't like to talking to you.
Have Daddy call me.
Dr. Denis, this is Beatriz Dick,
Rantes' friend.
Please tell him that
I haven't abandoned him.
I had important reasons for not visiting him.
I'll visit him again next Sunday at 5:00 p.m.
I called because I know you care about him.
Thank you, Doctor.
Listen Doctor, I've been cheating on you.
Hi, how are you?
I've finished seeing my patients.
Would you like some coffee?
I want to know how
Rantes seemed to you.
Excuse me for a minute.
I'll wait in the car. It's outside.
Beatriz, I don't want to alarm you, but...
Rantes did not explain his case fully.
He hides things.
A man always hides something in his soul that's why he's not happy.
Of course, but these are serious things.
Rantes is not an alcoholic.
He thinks he is from another planet.
- What's your opinion?
- About another planet?
No. Do you think it's serious?
Can he be cured?
The truth is, I don't know.
- I haven't made any progress.
- He seems well.
He feels well, but that place is not exactly a summer camp.
I know it.
I though you would be able to help me.
I want to help you, but I don't know how.
I'm searching for some human trace.
I can't find any trace of his past, of his origins.
I can say he's sick, but I don't really know what's wrong with him.
This happens often in psychiatry.
A man lives his life without leaving some imprint.
I know the real story of Rantes must exist somewhere.
I think you can help.
Why do you think I could help?
He lied to me, too.
You never heard him mention a place, a town where he might have lived?
- He never mentioned Uruguay?
- No.
As far as I remember, no.
Once he mentioned a trip.
There is a boy Rantes teaches music.
He's very impressed with him.
Rantes thinks he's a genius.
He admires him.
It bothers him because he believes that the boy's genius will be wasted.
Once, he mentioned taking the boy on a trip.
I asked about the trip. He just said,
''That boy will travel.''
Rantes can go out.
He comes and goes when he pleases.
Why doesn't he go out with you for a walk or a drink?
He doesn't want to.
He says he's too busy at the hospital.
- He's investigating something.
- Oh, yes...
Are you suggesting I don't do enough with him?
No, no. You do plenty by visiting him.
I better go.
Need a ride?
No, thanks.
I'm not going far. I like to walk.
So long, Doctor.
Thank you for your concern.
Next week I'll take him to a concert.
Would you like to come with us?
A REAL LOONEY CONCERT
MADMAN CONDUCTS IT
It would've been fine in the entertainment section, but... it made the Crime section, and
I look like a fool.
''How did the patient escape?''
He didn't escape.
He was out with one of our doctors.
You're right, I'm sorry.
I made a mistake.
I thought it would be good for him to get out.
He loves music. Besides, he's harmless.
So I see.
It's lucky you didn't take him to a military parade.
Instead of the Crime section we'd be front page news.
''Nut Orders Military Attack''
That's already happened, and Rantes wasn't involved.
Dr. Denis, this man is a delirious paranoid and you're treating him as a mere neurotic.
I don't have to remind you that a man who persists in such delirium is potentially dangerous.
Today he's a Martian, tomorrow he hears voices and kills someone.
You put him to work in Pathology, take him to concerts.
Perhaps you're experimenting with new healing technique.
We don't cure anybody.
If you've lost faith in your profession, you know what to do.
I come here every day because I believe that, despite the difficulties, we do serve.
Curing even one patient gives our work meaning.
One in 1500 patients.
That's a pretty low average.
Dr. Denis, regarding yourself, the subject is not closed.
Regarding the patient,
I want no more confusion.
Alpidol injectable, and that's final.
He'll fall apart.
It's the only way to shake the delirium.
Yes, but the delirium is all that keeps Rantes going.
He may become catatonic.
If he becomes catatonic, give him electroshock.
You have 15 years' experience.
This can't go on.
This... Rantes... was with you the whole time yesterday?
Yes, I picked him up and brought him back.
The other patients say that he led last night's activity.
The sentence was handed down
and would be carried out.
I had my orders.
After all, in this story
I was only Pilate.
I felt guilty, not about hoping
that Rantes would slip up,
but about how little
his future troubles bothered me.
The Saint, as was her custom,
had disappeared,
vaguely promising to visit soon.
Oh, Doctor.
I was worried.
I didn't mean any harm.
Please forgive me if my behavior yesterday caused you problems.
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
I understand storing information, but what makes them function?
What keeps them going?
What makes them feel?
Is that what you call the ''soul''?
You did nothing wrong except making yourself conspicuous.
You made the papers and the Director looks like a fool.
There are torturers who love Beethoven, who love their children, who go to Mass.
Man allows that.
At the time of killing, animals are more honest.
Don't say that. We're not talking about torturing or killing you,
I just have to give you medicine.
I cannot work here anymore.
For a while.
Where is that afternoon in which he first felt love?
What traces of the moments of pain and pleasure this man felt?
You may be feeling some changes, but don't worry.
It's for your own good.
And I won't abandon you.
There goes Einstein, there goes Bach,
Mr. Nobody, a madman, an assassin...
What do you think, Doctor?
Will this drain lead to heaven or hell?
The first results were unexpected.
Rantes' delirium seemed to persist.
Only I noticed a change.
His position, where he claimed
to receive information,
it had changed.
He wouldn't admit it, but these
transmissions had been affected.
The medication had damaged
his antennae.
More in touch with reality, Rantes
concentrated on concrete problems.
I considered this progress,
but it led to new problems.
Outraged by the hospital food,
he spoke for the patients
demanding that the Director
sample the food.
The Director refused to see him.
Rantes would not leave
until he was heard.
The next day, he changed his tactics.
He went to the newspaper
office to plead his case.
They showed interest,
but Rantes refused to leave,
unless the Director came to taste
the food.
He fared no better than he did
leading the orchestra.
There was the imbecile
asking for help,
claiming by his gestures that
he spoke for others.
How could he be helped?
How could one penetrate that robot
driven by a mechanism so fragile
that he needed to protect himself
with such strong armor?
I was beginning to doubt
I would ever find out why.
Doctor...
Doctor...
Why have you forsaken me?
- Yes.
- Doctor, Rantes is dying.
So am I. I want to see you.
I don't think it would be right.
Beatriz, don't make me make a scene.
I need to see you.
Why did you abandon him?
I didn't.
Perhaps he had been abandoned before.
- We'll cure him.
- You should leave him alone.
At least he was happy.
He'll get better.
I know it won't be easy...
Don't disappear again, Beatriz.
Rantes needs me.
I need you more.
I love you.
There will be a price to pay.
For sleeping with me?
No, for my betrayal.
Of whom?
Rantes.
- You have slept with Rantes?
- No... not because of that.
Then what?
I'm not what you think, Doctor.
You're incredible. We make love and you still call me Doctor.
I don't think anything, Beatriz.
I haven't felt this way in a long time.
What?
I'm happy.
- No matter what?
- No matter what.
I came with Rantes.
I'm one of those lost agents he spoke about, corrupted by sunsets, by certain fragrances.
I mean it.
All right. I lied to you.
I'm not an evangelist.
I didn't meet Rantes in church, but we do work with people in the village.
There is a boy Rantes wants to take.
It is also true we cannot feel... except some traitors like me.
Get out!
Get out, you goddamn nut!
Don't abandon us!
Who do you think I am?
I'm not stupid!
- Don't leave us!
- Get out!
- Please, please!
- Get out!
I could have loved you, too.
She is your sister?
In this photo... you were both
15 years younger.
Maybe 10.
Who was in the missing part?
Mom?
Dad?
Who was he?
An alcoholic?
Everything will work out, Rantes, but you must help me.
Was this... the garden of your house?
Was your house big?
Rantes...
I must know who you are.
And Beatriz?
Who is Beatriz?
Your sister?
Was she your wife?
February 9, 1985, was a Saturday.
I went fishing with my children.
Rantes had reached rock bottom.
His vital signs were weak.
The on-duty doctor ordered
the usual treatment,
electroshock to bring the patient out
of the catatonic state.
Rantes suffered a heart attack
from the anesthetic.
When I returned to the hospital, Rantes'
body had been sent to the University.
I wondered if some student,
some professor
upon opening his body, would sense
the mystery it had contained.
The patients didn't accept
Rantes' death.
They said he had gone, but that
he would return in a spaceship.
They would be there... waiting.
I waited for her.
If they were brother and sister,
God would be, for me, from then on
an unknown alcoholic who has fathered
these children,
these opposite sides of one coin.
Perhaps that's all we are, the foolish
or crazy children of a father,
who, at any rate,
was too difficult to forget.
It's 47 degrees right now at 7:17.
Sports news coming up at twenty-five after the hour.
Jack Walters will be having that exclusive interview with Billy Martin, and you know that could be fireworks.
The best bet for you folks coming in from Jersey, do whatever you got to do to use the Holland rather than the Lincoln Tunnel.
The backup there, at the Lincoln, is already a nightmare.
Looking forward to some bright blue skies all day today, with sunshine and the highs this afternoon somewhere in the upper 50s.
Especially in the city, it could get up near 60.
Enjoy it while you can, my friend.
Old Man Winter is going to be blowing on your neck any day now.
Lows tonight in the upper 30s with frost in some of the usually colder regions upstate.
You're listening to Willie Craig on PRM-FM 93.
And if your clock radio is set to go off at 7:18, it should be doing that right about now.
Start every day with music on PRM.
This is a cut from the new Pandemonium album, "Lady Stevie."
Peter, you're supposed to be ready in half an hour.
Ready for what?
We're going to the museum today, and then you and Mike and I...
Mom, I can't go. I need the rest of the vacation to finish this thing.
We made these plans a week ago, remember?
I know. But I'm way behind my schedule.
I'm sorry.
Peter, have you been up all night again?
Mom, the City Science Championships are next week.
Turn that thing off.
Put that down and look at me.
We made a little deal, didn't we?
You know I'm very proud and excited about your project, but I don't want you working all night on it.
I know. I'm sorry.
Mom, this is the most incredible thing that I've ever built.
I mean, this carries.
It carries? Carries what?
Binary numbers.
It can hold up to a 20-digit figure.
Now wait a second. You said it can carry, and it holds, too?
Both. It does both.
That's the whole point.
I mean, there isn't a circuit like this in any of my books.
I've invented it.
Well, that's great.
That's great, Peter.
What are you going to call it?
I don't know.
Well, come on.
Everybody knows that when you invent or discover something, you get to name it, like... a napoleon.
- A what?
- You know, the French pastry.
It was named after Napoleon.
Napoleon invented pastry?
I thought he was a general.
Well, you can't fight battles all the time.
He baked as a kind of relaxation.
Are you OK, Mom?
Listen. No more all-nighters, OK?
OK.
What is this called, anyway?
It's a peter, of course.
That is, if I ever get it finished.
OK, I'll let you skip it this time, but only if you promise not to work all night.
OK, I promise.
I promise. All right?
Grandma's going to be very disappointed.
But it's all right. I'll explain that you're working on your peter.
There's someone at the front door. Yes.
Between 11:00 and 12:00,
Thursday, right?
OK, fine. Bye.
Kate, good to see you.
Mary is on vacation, so I have to be my own receptionist.
How am I doing?
I hope you won't keep me waiting today.
I want to get to the museum early.
I have to be at lunch by 12:30 with Mike and his mother.
No waiting, go right in.
The doctor will be with you shortly.
So, what's happening?
My mother's driving me crazy as usual.
Did you talk to her?
She's hinting around about surprising me for my birthday.
She's going to come up from Florida, is she?
That's her surprise.
How do you feel about seeing her?
Well, I feel...
I should want to see her.
It's been six months since we've been down there, but... she'll just ruin my birthday.
And it's my day, not hers.
Well, now, think.
What are our options?
I could make up an excuse and tell her not to come.
No, I can't do that.
And let's not forget, it's supposed to be a surprise.
Anyway, it's not her.
It's just...
I don't feel up to it, or her or anything.
How are things going with Mike?
- Fine.
- Good.
No, they're not fine.
What a dumb word that is.
He gave me one of his wham-bang specials this morning, and I'm mad at him.
Isn't that right? Shouldn't I be mad?
Yeah. Did you tell him?
- What?
- That you were mad at him.
Of course not.
I moaned with pleasure at his touch.
Isn't that what every man wants?
I don't know. Is it?
Don't start that stuff with me.
Don't you think you'd feel better if you snapped at Mike instead of me?
Think about where your anger is going.
I'm sorry.
Stop apologizing and tell Mike he makes you mad.
Tell him he stinks in bed?
Does he?
- Yes.
- Then tell him.
Maybe there's something wrong with me.
There's nothing wrong with you.
Do you find me attractive?
Of course.
Would you want to sleep with me?
Yes.
Then why don't you?
Because I love my wife, and sleeping with you isn't worth jeopardizing my marriage.
Is it worth it to you to jeopardize yours?
I don't know.
Come on, look at the pictures.
This is so boring. Come on.
Look at the pictures.
That's what we came here for.
Hi.
First time here?
Stop it.
Cut it out.
Mommy.
Mommy.
Now you stop that. I told you to stand and be still and I meant it.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been so rude. Thank you for picking up...
Hello?
Who is this?
It's not polite to stare.
No.
No.
No. No.
So you really think Auditron's going up?
Well, I got it from a very good source.
- Double?
- You didn't hear it from me.
You know what? I'm going to give my broker a little call.
- Jesus.
- Well, what about...?
Oh, my...
No, wait! Help!
Please, you don't understand!
Please, call the police! Wait!
Please, call the police!
Call the police!
Somebody call the police!
Dr. Elliott, this is Lou Freeman.
I'm still in Chicago.
I won't be back in time for our appointment on Friday.
I'll give you a call on Monday, OK?
Robert, call George.
I'll be home over the weekend.
This is Bobbi.
You won't see me anymore, so I'm going to have a little session with your machine.
Doctor, I'm so unhappy.
I'm a girl inside this man's body, and you're not helping me to get out.
So I got a new shrink.
Levy's his name, and he's going to sign the papers so I can get my operation.
I borrowed your razor and...
Well, you'll read all about it.
Some blonde bitch saw me, but I'll get her.
Remember, if he calls you... you better tell Levy I'm OK.
Don't make me be a bad girl again.
Yes, Dr. Elliott, this is Mrs. Peters.
I just wanted to confirm our appointment for tomorrow. Two o'clock, right?
This is Detective Marino from the 13th Precinct.
One of your patients, Kate Miller, was killed tonight.
I wonder if you'd stop down at the precinct and ask for me.
I got some questions
I think you can help me with.
Are you sure?
OK.
Positive ID.
Hey, Eddie. Listen, I want you to take this over to the lab
- and get some pictures made of it.
- Yeah.
- Keep an eye on her.
- Right.
- Detective Marino?
- OK.
- Yeah.
- I'm Dr. Elliott.
Oh, Doctor.
Listen, would you have a seat outside my office in the corner over there.
- I'll be right with you.
- All right.
So give me three copies...
Why don't you let go of me, will you?
Are you Kate Miller's son?
I'm Dr. Elliott, your mother's doctor.
Why do you have to be here?
I made Mike bring me.
He's identifying the...
My mom wouldn't be dead if I had gone with her.
You shouldn't feel responsible for your mother's death.
If you talk about it,
I might be able to help.
Do you know who killed her?
- No.
- Then you can't help, can you?
Not now maybe.
But later, if you want someone to talk to about all this.
- Ask your father to call...
- No, he's not my father.
My father was killed in Vietnam.
Take this.
You can call me any time.
I'm always there all day long.
I'm usually there...
OK, Doctor, let's talk in here.
Call me.
She was picked up by Lockman at the museum.
She spent the afternoon at his place and was chopped up in the elevator on the way out.
That girl out there saw the murderer.
That's terrible.
- Do you know who it is?
- Some broad.
- A woman?
- Yeah.
Miss Blake didn't get a great look at her face because she had on these big sunglasses.
Is there anything I can do to help?
Yeah. When you spoke with Mrs. Miller... did she say she was going to meet anybody?
No.
Did she leave your office with anybody?
No.
What was she seeing you for?
Nothing too serious. She had some problems with her marriage, and I was helping her work them out.
What kind of problems?
Are you married, Detective Marino?
- Yeah.
- Children?
Two sons.
When was the last time you had intercourse with your wife?
Now what the fuck is it to you?
That's exactly how I feel about your questions concerning Mrs. Miller.
Hey, look, Doctor, we got a brutally murdered woman here, who passed the point of being embarrassed by anything you might tell me.
I guess you're right.
I'm sorry, but I'm not used to discussing a patient's case with outsiders.
I'm not an outsider. I'm a cop.
Now, let's make it easy for you.
Was she looking to get killed?
- You mean, was she suicidal?
- Yeah.
- No.
- No.
So why did she pick up this Lockman character?
- He could've been a killer.
- But he wasn't.
Yeah, but the next guy might have been.
You know, if at first you don't succeed.
Do you think she wanted to get killed?
Don't you? Look.
We got some hot-pants broad cruising around for some action.
The guy she picked up went down on her in a cab, for Christ's sake.
I got a blow-by-blow description from the cabby.
After she finishes with him, she comes on to some weirdo in the elevator?
Hey. There's all kinds of ways to get killed in this city, if you're looking for it.
Well... Yes, she did have a problem about her sexual worth.
And this morning she asked me if I was attracted to her.
Yeah, but you're not a psycho.
You do know something, though, don't you, Doc?
Yes, of course.
I do some work at Bellevue.
Could she have met one of these nuts at your office?
I mean, some kind of weirdo she could've turned on that might have followed her?
The term we use, Detective Marino, is not "weirdo," but a person suffering from emotional dysfunction and a problem of maladaption.
And they never come to my office.
Are you sure?
How about a new patient?
I mean, how do you know how nuts they are until you see them?
That's possible, but it's hardly likely...
Doctor.
You're not protecting one of your patients now, are you?
Absolutely not.
Well, Doc, you've got to look at it my way.
See, we got no leads, except a witness out there who maybe should take a look at all your patients that were around that morning.
And that way, I can be absolutely sure that my weirdo isn't your
"person suffering from emotional dysfunctions and problems of maladaption."
Peter, come on, let's go home.
Excuse me.
OK, Doctor.
I'm sorry you're not more cooperative, which means that
I'm just going to have to waste some time in getting a court order to check out your appointment book.
I'm sorry, too.
But I feel I must protect the confidentiality of my patients.
Of course, we're just two professionals doing our job.
It's too bad we can't work together.
Come on.
Thank you very much for your help.
I'll be in touch.
Yes, thank you for waiting.
This is the answering service.
- Would you care to leave a message?
- Yes, I would.
- This is Dr. Elliott.
- How do you spell that?
E-L-L-I-O-T-T.
What is the message?
Would you please say that I would very much like to see her, and could she call me at my office.
So, Miss Blake.
Are you still living at 93 Nassau Street?
That's right.
Tell me, how did you happen to be in that building that Mrs. Miller was killed in?
I was visiting a friend.
And who was that?
Well... it's sort of embarrassing.
I'd really rather not say.
Why?
He's married.
What kind of building is this?
Everybody's getting laid after lunch.
I didn't say I was "getting laid," to use your expression.
What's the matter?
- I'm a little crude for you?
- That's right.
Look, Miss Blake, let's cut this shit.
I got all the dope on you right here.
Does this look familiar? Let me see.
March 5th. Charge: disorderly conduct, solicitation for the purpose of prostitution.
Arresting Officer: Duram.
Apprehended at the Park Avenue Hotel.
Classy arrest.
- Thank you.
- Let's face it, you're a whore.
A Park Avenue whore, but you're still a whore.
Now, who were you fucking?
Fuck you.
No, fuck you.
You're no witness.
You're a suspect.
What are you talking about?
We got a murder weapon with your prints on it.
That's bullshit.
Why would I want to kill her?
You were there with the razor.
You tell me.
I told you. There was a blonde woman in the elevator...
Yeah, except nobody else saw this blonde woman enter or leave the building.
You didn't notice if she had wings, did you?
She was in the elevator. I saw her.
So, what were you doing there?
- I had a job.
- Who?
You want me to get in trouble, don't you?
- You are in trouble.
- Hey, I didn't kill her.
So who were you fucking?
Ted, I didn't get his last name.
He's from out of town.
Well, that's great.
Yeah, Ted from out of town.
That's almost as good as the blonde from the elevator.
It's true.
He was standing right behind me.
He saw the elevator doors open and that... woman inside all cut up and bleeding.
I know all about Mrs. Miller.
We got her downstairs.
But what about this blonde?
Did he see her, too?
I don't know.
Well, look, Miss... Miss Blake.
You're going to save me a lot of trouble by finding this Ted from out of town and getting him in town and downtown and in here to sign this statement as to exactly what he saw and when he saw it.
How the hell am I supposed to know where he is?
Well, if you can't find him,
I sure can't.
And anyway, you got a lot better motivation than I do: your ass.
Now, get the hell out of here.
I'm giving you 48 hours.
And don't try to blow town.
I'll be keeping tabs on you.
Norma? Liz.
Where the hell have you been?
I've been trying to get you all day.
Ted was terrific.
That's why I'm calling.
I'd like to see him again.
When's he coming back?
Two weeks?
That's no good.
Do you have a number for him?
I'd like to give him a call.
What do you mean, your escort service doesn't give out numbers?
I want to talk to him.
Trouble? No, I'm not in any trouble.
I just want to talk to the guy.
OK.
OK, thanks!
Thanks for nothing.
You're just never in.
I've been out myself, running down that nosy bitch.
I found out where she lives, so I'm just going to wait right here until she shows her face.
And then I'm going to cut those spying eyes out.
What were you calling me about, anyway?
It wouldn't be about that murder
I read about in the papers.
Hell of a way to lose a patient.
But you shouldn't try to fuck them, Doc.
Hi, Max. It's Liz.
Look, I want to buy 60 shares of Auditron. What does it sell for?
I'm glad I took care of that cock-teaser.
$15.60 a share?
You would've done the same thing yourself.
That's $936... Hold it a minute, Max.
I guess that's why I used your razor.
- Hello.
- But don't worry about it, Doc.
- Hi, Norma.
- Just call the police...
- I'm sorry about yesterday.
- ...lost-and-found department.
Yes, I know, I was a bad girl.
Remember, if Levy calls...
Tonight?
- ...tell him I'm OK.
- No, I really can't.
Norma, hold on just a minute.
I'm talking to my mother.
- Max, when do you need money?
- That's funny.
- No, I don't want to sell anything.
- Isn't it?
Hold it, Max.
Norma, do you think this guy might go for $500?
Great.
Hold on just a minute.
I'm going to say goodbye to my mother.
OK, Max, I got the money.
I'll have it for you tomorrow.
OK. OK.
Hi, Norma.
Do you think you could put together a coffee break and a hot lunch, for tomorrow?
Yeah, I need $1, 000 for my mother's operation.
No, it's nothing serious.
I'm sure she'll be fine.
- Great. Now, what time tonight?
- It's been three to four years since your surgery.
- 8:30. Where?
- I want to show a picture, prior to...
- OK, anything special?
- Where'd you find that?
Actually we stole it from
People magazine, which has an article.
Thank God straight fucks are still in style.
This is Nancy Hart, the transsexual.
- Just in from Cleveland.
- Isn't that something?
- I'll be there.
- You were a war correspondent?
Among other things.
And a foreign correspondent in the Middle East. And...
I did a lot of police reporting, and I dove on Spanish treasure wrecks.
You did a lot of macho things, then?
This is very common among transsexuals.
You find...
When I speak of transsexuals,
I tend to speak of male to female because there are a whole lot of more of them than going the other way.
And an awful lot of them have real macho backgrounds.
I know a police captain, a West Pointer, a couple of fighter pilots.
They all, you know, most of them tried real hard.
You were married twice?
You are also the father of three children.
So, you enjoyed a...
I don't want to say normal, I guess that's a prejudicial way to put it, but you enjoyed the traditional role of father.
You fathered three children, and you have engaged in at least two heterosexual relationships.
More than that.
I've always been a devout heterosexual.
Cleveland?
Excuse me?
Room 331, you're the guy from Cleveland, right?
Three-thirty-one. I'm from Cleveland.
Well, hi.
I'm Liz from the escort service.
You're kidding?
- It's me.
- Well, hi.
Yeah, I'm glad to meet you.
Well, are you going to pump me dry here or invite me in?
I'm sorry, come in.
You know, could I get you anything...?
93 Nassau Street.
Well, come on, let's go.
Look, forget that address
I just gave you.
Drop me at Columbus Circle.
Could you help me out?
Someone's following me.
This is Dr. Elliott again.
Did Bobbi pick up my messages yet?
- Yes, she has.
- She did?
- Yes, she did.
- When?
I'm sorry. I wouldn't know.
Could you give her another message, please?
- Yes. Go ahead.
- Yeah.
It is urgent that I see her.
I will be in my office all tonight and after 5:00 tomorrow.
What's the going rate on running lights?
Did I lose her?
You're doing swell, just swell.
But she's still coming.
Look, I didn't deliver, so why don't you let me take you to dinner instead?
- All right, you got a date.
- OK.
- Look, I gotta go.
- OK. Listen, I'll give you a call.
Yeah, call me.
Excuse me.
Get out of the way!
It's a free country!
He nearly clipped me!
Keeps pushing me.
Do you know her?
Hey, lady, what you looking for?
A train.
They still stop here, don't they?
Yeah, they stop here.
They stop down there, too.
Am I bothering you?
- No, you ain't bothering me.
- Good.
But you're bothering me.
She's bothering you, Sonny?
Yeah, that's right, this bitch is bothering me.
- What are you going to do about it?
- I'm going to break her fucking ass.
Hey, why break it when we can fuck it first?
Hey, lady, where you going?
I don't want to crowd you guys.
Why are you down here if you didn't want to crowd us?
Give me a break.
Hey, man, don't let her get away!
Get after her!
Come on, man.
Come on, catch her, man.
Shit! Get out of the way!
Take it easy, lady, this ain't the rush hour.
Where the fuck are you guys when somebody needs you?
I was almost attacked.
- When?
- Right here, now, by those punks.
I don't see nothing.
Well, they were right here.
I thought you said you were attacked...
There are, but there's this blonde that's been following...
Oh, forget it.
Let's get the fuck out of here!
The blonde must be one of Elliott's patients.
I was unloading my camera when I saw her come out of his office and I followed her to you.
What was that stuff you sprayed on her?
It's a kind of Mace I made at home.
It's a pretty simple compound of sodium...
Save the Mr. Wizard lecture,
I wouldn't know sodium from Adam.
It sure worked.
It's temporary blindness.
It only lasts about ten seconds.
Saved my life.
I know.
I wish I had saved Mom's.
You liked your mom a lot, didn't you?
Yeah.
I miss her.
You want some more Coke?
Yeah. Yeah, thank you.
How do you like my painting?
It's... very nice.
I bought it a couple of years ago for $500.
It's really a great investment.
I mean, ten years from now, it could be worth... a million dollars.
More if the artist dies, of course.
- Good luck with it.
- Thanks.
Doesn't your father wonder where you are?
He's not my father. He's my stepfather.
I told him I am staying at my friend
Paul's, and he'll cover for me.
I'll take you home tomorrow.
I don't want to go home.
Miss Blake, I've got some pictures...
Call me Liz, OK?
Liz, I've got some pictures of that blonde from a camera I hid outside Elliott's office.
Now, we gotta get in, get Elliott's appointment book, and get her name.
That's what the police are for.
Come on, let's talk to Marino.
Fine, you talk to Marino.
I'm going to find out the blonde's name.
Who do you think you are, Superman?
You're just a kid, for God's sake.
Yeah, I'm the kid that saved your life.
All right, look, let me talk to Marino.
If he cops out, then I'll help you.
OK, but you can't mention my name.
Mike would kill me.
I'm supposed to be... studying for a French exam.
Well, your friend's covering for you tonight, right?
Well, I'm your friend, too, and I'll be the best cover you ever had.
OK.
You sure you going to be OK here?
Fine.
Well... Here you go.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Hey, Marino, I gotta talk to you.
- Mr. Out-of-Town turn up?
- No.
Then you better send for your overnight bags.
Hey, come on, you know I didn't kill that woman.
You're still my best bet.
For your information, she tried to kill me last night.
Really?
Is that supposed to be concern in your voice?
I take a professional interest in our citizens knocking each other off.
Where did this happen?
She followed me from the Sheraton into the subway.
I thought I lost her, but she was waiting when I got home.
- She tried to slash me.
- Any witnesses to this one?
- Yes.
- Who?
- I can't tell you.
- Out of town again?
No, I just promised
I wouldn't say anything.
You know, this has a familiar ring to it.
Look, Marino, I'm not interested in your wiseass remarks.
Someone's trying to kill me, and I need help.
I'll help you. I got a nice cell.
You'll be very safe in it.
Hey, Eddie.
Hey, wait a minute. Look.
I know the murderer is one of Elliott's patients.
- How do you know that?
- Because she came out of his office.
Did you see her?
Well, no, not exactly.
But I know she came out.
You got to get in there, get his appointment book.
Her name's got to be in it.
I hope you make a better hooker than you do a detective.
I thought about Elliott's appointment book a long time ago.
- So?
- So...
You can't just walk into some shrink's joint and start going through his books.
You need a search warrant.
And judges take a long time before they let you start snooping around some shrink's office.
Of course, that wouldn't prevent a paranoid murder suspect from breaking in.
You know, searching for some evidence to defend her case.
Oh, I get it.
You want me to break in for you.
I don't want you to do anything illegal.
You can quote me on that.
But I'm booking you tomorrow.
You got it? Tomorrow.
I'm Dr. Levy.
How do you do? I'm Dr. Elliott.
What can I do for you, Dr. Elliott?
You're seeing a patient of mine.
That's right.
I believe she's dangerous.
Really? In what way?
She's causing me trouble because I wouldn't approve her sex-change operation.
What kind of trouble has she caused you?
She's threatened me several times over the phone.
- She also stole my razor.
- Why would she do that?
Doctor, did you read about the woman who was slashed to death in an elevator?
It was on the front page,
I could hardly miss...
Kate Miller, the victim, was my patient.
You don't think that Bobbi had anything to do with that?
My razor's gone.
Kate Miller was killed with a razor.
Nobody else could have taken it?
Doctor, I am not paranoid.
Bobbi has threatened me over the phone.
She said she was going to hurt me.
My patient was slashed to death, and my razor's gone.
Now you don't have to be a detective to figure it out, do you?
Come with me, and... we'll talk to the police.
I've already been to the police.
But I didn't tell them about Bobbi.
I wanted to talk to her first.
I wanted to be absolutely sure that it was her.
But she wouldn't return my calls.
I was hoping you'd be able to help.
Yes, I'll help.
I'll talk to her.
If I agree with your diagnosis, we'll go to the police.
Thank you.
Please let me know what happens.
Do you know why Bobbi came to see me in the first place?
No.
Why don't we go to my office, and we'll try to get in touch with her.
I am late for an appointment now.
Why don't you call me at my office when you've reached her.
All right.
You sure you'll be at your office?
Yes, I'm sure.
I'll call you there.
Peter Miller, I left some Super-8 film.
There's four dollars there.
I timed Elliott's patients coming out of his office, and the fastest was eight seconds.
So I set my camera to go off every four seconds so I'd be sure to get a good shot of everybody.
- That's her.
- She must be his last appointment.
We got to get a look in that book.
Yeah, I know. Marino wants it, too.
Only, I can get it for him faster.
No legal red tape, just my ass.
Look, I'll get it, nobody cares about my ass. I'm just a grief-struck kid.
Yeah, but what a kid.
Okay, I got an idea.
It was very nice of you to see...
It was nice of you to see me so soon.
I try to keep my nights open for returning phone calls or in case a patient needs some extra help.
I was worried about you.
You've had a terrible experience.
I know.
I didn't realize...
But I've been having these terrible nightmares.
What were they about?
Well...
I have to get a cigarette.
I'm in this house that I've never been to before, visiting a friend.
He's not there.
I'm watching TV... and the doorbell rings.
It's a man.
He's big, dark.
He says his car broke down, and he needs to use the phone.
I believe him and let him in... although I know something's wrong.
He closes the door, locks it, and takes out a razor.
He says he's not going to hurt me.
Then he tells me... what he's going to do to me... and how much I'm going to like it.
All the time he's talking,
I can see the bulge in his pants.
He orders me to strip.
I do it, keeping one eye on the razor.
He drops his pants... forces me down, on my stomach.
He spreads my legs, kneels down behind me... and rests the cold blade.
Forcing it.
I'm sorry.
What's the matter?
It's just so dirty.
Why do you say that?
Look, I know what dirty is, and this is dirty.
Well, why don't you just talk about it?
I'm sure it's not as bad as you think.
It's very bad.
And you're talking to an expert on bad.
Oh, really?
Now what makes you such an expert?
Because I'm a hooker.
And I have done most of the bad things you just read about.
Do you like doing these things?
- Sometimes.
- What do you like about it?
I like to turn men on.
I must do a pretty good job because they pay me a lot.
Do you ever have any sex that's not paid for?
Is that a proposal?
No. It...
It's what we psychiatrists call a question.
Yes.
"Yes" what?
Yes, I do. For men that turn me on.
What sort of men turn you on?
Mature, doctorly type.
Like you.
Are you sexually attracted to me?
Yes. Are you?
Attracted to you?
Yes.
But then, this isn't a social visit, is it?
You've come here for help and my job is to offer you emotional assistance.
How about some sexual assistance?
Do you want to fuck me?
- Oh, yes.
- Well, why don't you?
- Because I'm a doctor and...
- Fucked a lot of doctors.
- And I'm married.
- Fucked a lot of them, too.
Don't you think we're getting off the point?
Do you mind if I take off my coat?
No.
And the rest, too?
Now, why would you want to do a thing like that?
Well, because of the size of that cock in your pants.
I don't think you're so married.
Well?
What do you think?
I think you're a very attractive woman.
Would you like to touch me?
Yes and no. Yes, because I'm...
Well, why don't you?
I told you why.
That's right. You're a married doctor.
I remember now.
- I think you're full of shit.
- You do?
Just because I happen to have personal and professional ethics?
Look, Doc, I think you're kind of shy.
So... I'm going to go powder my nose and when I come back,
I hope to find your clothes right next to mine.
And if not, we can just get back to the mind-fuck.
Dr. Elliott?
Dr. Elliott?
Dr. Elliott?
You really are shy, aren't you?
Liz!
Behind you, Liz!
So you had me followed?
That's right.
You've met Betty Luce, one of our best young police... persons.
When I told you I was attacked on the subway, you thought I was nuts.
Well, Detective Luce told me she lost you at Columbus Circle.
I didn't figure there was another blonde following you. I mean, who would?
Yeah, and you wrote me off as a girl with an overactive imagination.
Yeah, something like that.
- And she followed me to Elliott's.
- That's right.
Thank God.
What's wrong with that guy, anyway?
- He was a transsexual.
- What?
A transsexual.
About to make the final step, but his male side couldn't let him do it.
Male side?
There was Dr. Elliott, and there was Bobbi.
Bobbi came to me to get psychiatric approval for a sex-reassignment operation.
I thought he was unstable, and Elliott confirmed my diagnosis.
Opposite sexes inhabiting the same body.
The sex-change operation was to resolve the conflict.
But as much as Bobbi tried to get it,
Elliott blocked it.
So Bobbi got even.
By killing Mrs. Miller.
Yes, she aroused Elliott, just as you did, Miss Blake.
You mean, when Elliott got turned on,
Bobbi took over?
Yes. It was like Bobbi's red alert.
Elliott's penis became erect and Bobbi took control, trying to kill anyone that made Elliott masculinely sexual.
When Elliott came to my office, it was the first time
I saw Bobbi's masculine self.
When he told me that he thought
Bobbi had killed Mrs. Miller, he was confessing himself.
I immediately called Detective Marino.
So why the hell didn't you stop me from going to Elliott's?
Why? Because I was at a football game with my kids, that's why.
By the time I spoke with Dr. Levy, you were already over there.
So you never really thought
I killed Mrs. Miller?
No. But I had to get into Elliott's office to find out which weirdo did, so I pressed you into service.
Are you kidding?
So I had Miss Luce there tailing you to make sure you didn't get into too much trouble.
Thanks.
Well, it's always wonderful to be of some assistance to the police.
Are you kidding?
So what's going to happen to Elliott?
Well?
There's some men and women who think they're born in the wrong body.
They're called transsexuals.
And all they want to do is have their sex changed.
How do you do that?
Well, if you're a man that wants to become a woman, you take female hormones.
What do they do?
Well, your skin softens, you grow breasts, and you don't get hard anymore.
Great.
You sure you want to know about this?
Yeah. It's giving me some wonderful new ideas for a science project.
Instead of building a computer,
I could build a woman... out of me.
Great idea. In that case,
I'll give you all the details.
The next step is surgery.
Let me see if I can remember the exact word that Levy told me.
Oh, yeah, a penectomy.
What's that?
You know, when they take your penis and slice it down the middle.
Yeah, that's what I thought it was.
Then... castration... plastic reconstruction and the formation of an artificial vagina.
A vaginoplasty, to those in the know.
And I thought Elliott just put on a dress.
He did. And a wig, too.
But you see, that's no good in bed, when you gotta take everything off.
What's going to happen to him now?
Well, first he has to recover from the gun wound, and then if he's ever sane enough to get out of Bellevue, they'll try him.
And guess who's the star witness.
You.
Right. Something
I'm really looking forward to.
Well, I think I'm going to stick to my computer.
That sounds like a very good idea.
Look, Liz...
I gotta get home and get to work.
I'm going to miss having you on my tail.
It made me feel kind of safe.
Look, you want to come home with me?
I'd love the company.
Wouldn't Mike mind?
Well, Mike's out of town on a business trip.
We got plenty of room.
Great. I could sure use the vacation.
Good. I'll get the check.
I told ya.
A quick tunnel job, then up the stairs, as pretty as you please.
That's worth over ten thousand pounds.
- We're gonna be rich!
- Not this time, gentlemen.
Sherlock Holmes!
Watson?
Right you are, Holmes.
Run, Archie, or we'll swing for it!
Don't let those ruffians escape!
I am Inspector Lestrade.
You are under...
There's no escape, my friend.
This will be a pleasure.
- Well done, Watson.
- Are you all right, Holmes?
Quite.
Which is more than I can say for John Clay, one of London's least notorious thieves.
Inspector! I have your man.
Come on.
Well, Mr. Holmes...
I don't know how, but you've done it again.
Thank you. That's high praise indeed, coming from such a workmanlike detective as yourself.
And now, if you have nothing further to add,
I hereby declare this case... closed.
Good! We got kippers for breakfast.
Just a minute.
You idiot!
What?
Confound you!
What... what did I say?
What did I say wrong?
I did everything you said, exactly as you said it.
All right, what did I do?
You're not going to tell me, are you?
All right. You want to know what's wrong?
- I said I did, didn't I?
- I'll tell you what's wrong.
Don't declare a case is closed...
Just a minute. My public awaits. until I say it's closed!
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, Mr. Holmes!
- May we have a word?
- Certainly.
How did you know somebody was tunneling into the Royal Gallery?
That was very interesting.
There was fresh dirt in the building next door.
Fresh dirt...
Would you like to elaborate on that?
It was an elementary deduction based on the clues at hand.
But didn't Scotland Yard see the very same clues?
I see and observe.
Isn't that rather redundant?
Describe the front of this building.
Without looking, describe the front of this house.
Well, it's brick... it's got black railings, I think, and windows.
- How many windows?
- How many?
I don't know.
Quite so. He sees, but he does not observe.
Whereas I see and observe, and thus bring many notorious blackguards to justice.
Hear, hear!
Did I put that reporter in his place?
Just for the record... how many windows are there in the front of this building?
I haven't the foggiest idea.
There are fifteen windows, you fool!
Fifteen!
Not only that...
Not only that, but the reporter you just embarrassed... he knows how to type, is somewhat nearsighted, and recently returned from a holiday.
"And how do you know that, Watson?"
Elementary. From the creases on his wrist where a typist presses against the table.
Do you think this is a good likeness of me?
Wonderful story, by the way, but on page two, you have me admitting a mistake.
A writer must write of which he knows.
Do you think that's really necessary?
I mean, tarnishing the image and all that?
Hello.
What have we here?
Something's afoot.
How many times have I told you to stay away from my experiments?
Something wrong?
I seem to spend an increasing amount of my precious time correcting your blunders, both private and public!
I see. It's the Clay case.
You still in a snit over that?
Well, if you want my opinion...
I beg your pardon?
Opinion, did you say?
Oh, my God. Not that speech again.
May I remind you, for your information, sir, that your opinions are my opinions.
Oh, piffle.
I created the character of Sherlock Holmes, and hired you merely to play the part... snatching you from the gutter.
Hardly the gutter, old boy.
After all, I was once an actor of note.
Whose last play ran a total of one-half of one performance.
I'll have you know Shadow of Death with Reginald Kincaid was a towering work, decades ahead of its time.
Lesson number two. Advanced Bowing.
My only regret was that it ended before the climactic third-act duel.
Too bad you didn't have a chance to see it.
I've no use for theatrical swordplay.
All I ask is that you obey a few simple rules, not the least of which is, a case is not closed until I say it's closed.
I think you underestimate my own native deductive abilities.
Do you hear those footsteps?
I'd say this was a woman about five-feet-five, weight about twelve-and-a-half stone, age fifty-four. Voilà.
Blown yourself up again?
It's for you... your
Baker Street Irregulars.
Hello, boys.
Wiggins, give it back.
Just tryin' to earn a living.
We heard you was looking for us, Doctor.
Yes, there's been some trouble concerning the break-in at the Royal Gallery.
What?
We heard that Mr. Holmes declared the case closed.
That will prove, after some creative writing, to be merely a ruse on Mr. Holmes's part.
Something's not right... John Clay does not deal in works of art.
I need you boys to have a look around... eyes sharp, ears quick.
A copper apiece for your trouble, and a shilling for what you learn.
We'll do our best, won't we, lads?
Don't let us keep you, boys.
Come on... out.
Don't worry about a thing.
We know how much you could use some real assistance.
You're making a laughingstock of me. How can I be...
How can I be expected to maintain a character when you belittle me in front of those hooligans?
Are we talking of the same man who once declared that the late Colonel Howard had been bludgeoned to death by a blunt "excrement"?
Is it my fault you have such poor handwriting?
Anyway, it was just a little mistake.
He's been at it again.
- I never liked that woman.
- Come in, Mrs. Hudson.
I found it under a loose board in the stairwell.
Thank you.
An occasional libation enables me to stiffen my resolve.
Your resolve should be pickled by now.
I don't believe that either of you realize what pressure I'm under!
Do you know what it's like to commit to memory a never-ending list of clues and deductions to be parroted back to
Lestrade and reporters?
Blood stains on a toothpick? Cigar ash?
New soil in the garden next door?
Endless twaddle!
Twaddle!
Are you referring to the systematic gathering of evidence and the logical deductions based thereon?
I am referring to twaddle!
You would be well served to include fewer of these dreary details in future chronicles, and place greater emphasis on me.
I am, after all, the one the public really cares about.
Would you be so kind as to excuse us for a moment?
Careful, Watson! Remember your blood pressure!
And good riddance to bad rubbish, I must say.
Am I to understand that you are giving me notice?
Let's just say that the curtain has come down on yet another miserable performance.
Right.
I was once a figment of your imagination.
But now, Sherlock Holmes belongs to the whole world.
At last we're free of that ungrateful baggage!
From now on, things are gonna be much more pleasant around here.
An actor?!
Nothing the matter, nothing at all.
Back to work.
Hold my calls.
We'll start at the beginning... shall we?
It was about nine years ago.
One of my patients was a
Scotland Yard inspector investigating the
Paxton murder case.
I gave him the name of the murderer, but gave credit to a nonexistent detective.
At the time, I was hoping for an appointment to the staff of a rather conservative medical college.
I knew that they'd frown on my little...
- Hobby?
- Exactly.
Well, I didn't get the appointment.
Instead, what I got was a quite unanticipated public demand to meet this Sherlock Holmes.
So you hired this Reginald Kincaid.
He was an actor.
Unfortunately, he was also a gambler, a womanizer, and a drunkard.
John, you have jeopardized the integrity of English literature.
Still, I should have known.
He was always borrowing large sums of money off me and never paying me back.
The cad.
Don't worry. We deducted it from your royalties.
- Who else knows of this?
- No one.
Except Mrs. Hudson and the Irregulars.
But it's time now for the public to learn the truth.
The truth?
Certainly.
No one will want to read of that twit again.
His popularity will plummet.
They'll be desperate for my new creation.
What new creation?
John Watson, the Crime Doctor!
I could have it ready for your very next issue.
Sit down, John.
People buy the Strand magazine expecting to read a story in which Sherlock Holmes solves the case, not the Crime Surgeon.
Crime Doctor.
Crime Doctor, Crime
Surgeon, Crime Dentist... who cares, really?
Let's face it, John,
Sherlock Holmes is worth a fortune to the magazine.
You're stuck with him.
Norman, I'll write what I want.
There's nothing you can do.
The devil there isn't.
You can't go in there!
What is this?
Sorry, Doctor, but we found something. Down by the docks.
- Excellent!
- Hello, ducks.
If you'll excuse us, we have work to do.
Do you work here?
Watson, I'm warning you... it's Sherlock Holmes, or we'll sue you for everything you're worth!
And I mean everything!
Anyone seen my watch?
- There it is.
- Camden Paper Mill.
Burned about four this morning.
- Same time as the Clay robbery.
- On the button.
Good lad! Now we're getting somewhere.
Let's take a look around.
Went up like a torch, they say.
Well, it's full of wood pulp and paper, you see?
I'm sorry, sir. No one's allowed in this area.
Quite all right, I assure you.
I'm Dr. John Watson.
Nobody's sick here.
You don't understand.
- John Watson.
- The Crime Doctor.
That's right. John Watson, the Crime Doctor.
Crime Doctor? Never heard of him.
Though your name sounds a bit familiar.
All right.
I am Dr. John Watson... author of the Sherlock
Holmes mysteries.
The Sherlock Holmes?
Me and the wife has read every one of his stories.
All right. Now, if you'll excuse me...
I'm sorry, I still can't let you in.
Strict orders about that, I'm afraid.
But Mr. Holmes... did he send you here?
He certainly did not!
Well, perhaps the next time you should check with him first.
Save yourself a trip.
You try and fight crime in this city, and all you hear about is Sherlock Holmes!
"What's he like? When will you see him next?"
Never, that's when! Never!
Doctor, dear, keep your voice down.
- Why should I?
- Because you have visitors.
Inspector Lestrade and a Lord Smithwick.
Of the Treasury?
Gentlemen, won't you come up?
Oh, yes, thank you very much.
Mr. Holmes is in, is he?
Dr. Watson will see you, although he is quite busy with his scholarly pursuits.
Gentlemen.
Good afternoon, Inspector.
This is Lord Smithwick,
Her Majesty's Chancellor of the Exchequer.
My pleasure, sir.
His Lordship wishes to see Mr. Holmes.
I'm sorry to say he's not here at the moment.
Oh, how disappointing!
As I said before,
I really don't think
Mr. Holmes's involvement in this case is necessary.
- I quite agree.
- You do?
However, the Crime Doctor is at your disposal.
Who the deuce is the Crime Doctor?
What?
Most amusing, but this is a matter of the gravest urgency.
When do you expect Mr. Holmes?
Not for a while. He's out of town.
Good afternoon.
Well... too bad.
I'm sure we'll be able to get along quite well without Mr. Holmes.
Wait!
Today's Friday, isn't it?
Of course it is. Silly me.
Holmes is supposed to be back tonight.
How fortunate.
Very well. We shall return at seven tonight.
Come along, Inspector.
Till then, gentlemen.
- We've made this trip for nothing.
- I must ask you once again...
Where did you get that hat?
Where did you get that tile?
Isn't it a knobby one?
It's just the proper style
I would like to have one just the same as that
Where'er I go, they shout Hello!
And where'd you get that hat?
Where did you get that hat?
Where did you get that tile?
Good evening.
Have you seen Peter Bright?
He's disappeared.
Hello, Connie.
All right...
Who did it?
Come on... which one of ya pinched me?
- Pinched, you say?
- That's right.
May I be of... some assistance?
The name is Holmes...
Sherlock Holmes.
Constance Peyton, sir.
Pleased to meet ya.
Charmed.
Now, let's see...
By careful observation of the patrons of these premises,
I have been able to deduce the identity of the fiend who pinched you.
Me. Did it again!
- Thank you, my good man.
- Thank you, sir.
I'll make this brief.
I'll make this brief.
I'll need to see some money.
It's been five days now.
- Now, see here, my good man...
- Go ahead, sir, it's on me.
Thank you, sir.
- How are things?
- Couldn't be better.
Good health.
I'll meke this braif.
I'll make this brief...
I want you to come back.
Like I predicted... you need me.
I do not need you.
Then what are you here for?
I didn't call for you.
All right, I need you... for this one blasted time.
One time, and that's all? You're gonna have to do better than that.
Don't push me. You've already run out of money.
This is because you lack the necessary skills to gain decent employment.
Wrong, Watson.
I have been honing my ability of elementary deduction to a razor's edge... observe.
Excuse me, sir.
How are things on the subcontinent?
I beg your pardon?
You are a reporter just back from India, are you not?
I'm a barrister, and I've never been to India in my life.
- But you do read the Times.
- Of course.
There you have it.
My card.
I'll ask you just once more.
Are you coming with me or not?
I would rather waltz naked through the fires of hell.
I can see coming here was a mistake.
Excellent deduction.
Keep up the good work.
Gentlemen. And what can I do for you?
A mystery to be solved?
You might say that.
There's a little matter of a gambling debt.
The mystery is why you ain't paid it.
Gentlemen, you are dealing with Sherlock Holmes, a man of honor and character beyond reproach.
There he is!
That's the bloke who pinched me bum!
Pardon me! Pardon me!
Excuse me, luv.
- Didn't I say seven o'clock?
- Forgive me for being late.
Is Mr. Holmes with you?
Well, actually, Lord Smithwick, a short time ago I received a wire from Holmes instructing me to take down the details and begin the investigation... without him, as it were.
- What?
- Believe it or not,
I am every bit Holmes's equal as a detective.
I happen to know that you recently recovered from an illness, that you smoke a pipe... probably rosewood... and you spent time in China.
This is no time for parlor games.
This is a matter for professionals.
You gotta help me!
There's two big men...
You're back! So good to see you!
Isn't this a clever disguise?
A drunken lout... very realistic.
This woman said I pinched her bottom...
Pinched her bum! Ha ha!
Gentlemen... Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
It's good to see the department is letting you out at night again.
Trouble at the Exchequer?
Well, to be honest...
Wait... how did you know?
The same way that I can tell you've recently recovered from an illness, smoke a pipe... probably rosewood...
- and have spent some time in...
- China.
Amazing!
Thank you.
Before we start, perhaps a little sherry?
I wish we could, but the matter which brings me here involves the fate of the entire Empire.
I see. Perhaps a whiskey, then?
Perhaps later.
Tell me the details, and omit nothing.
- Watson, pay close attention.
- Do you know what these are?
- I do.
- So do I.
Plates for the Bank of
England's five pound note.
- Undoubtedly.
- Or very good imitations.
- Precisely.
- Exactly.
Indeed.
That's cleared that up.
How about that whiskey?
- May I?
- I suppose so.
Just two nights ago, these clever forgeries were exchanged for the genuine plates.
If the real plates are in the hands of some foreign power...
Or someone even more treacherous, the kingdom could find itself awash in counterfeit notes.
And I don't have to tell you what that would mean.
Yes, you do.
It would mean, quite simply, economic ruin for England.
Nobody would know which five pound notes were real and which weren't.
Gentlemen, I accept this case.
My fee will be five hundred pounds... payable in ten pound notes.
Good evening.
We can all rest a little easier now, Inspector.
Drive on, my good man.
I don't suppose it would make any difference if I said I have grave doubts about Mr. Holmes.
I must confess,
I feel a bit prouder knowing
Sherlock Holmes is British.
Do you suppose he took the case, Professor?
Watson?
My dear boy, how could he resist?
This is working out so very well.
Driver.
Gentlemen... I am here.
Mr. Holmes, at last!
Welcome to Her
Majesty's Royal Mint.
This is one of my long-time employees, Mister...
- Hadlers, sir.
- Hadlers, yes.
Inspector Lestrade was inquiring about the vaults.
It's my guess that it's an inside job by someone with a key.
You have a key, don't you, Hadlers?
Me? No!
Inspector, please. Mr.
Holmes will take over now.
It's quite all right.
As a matter of fact, Lestrade,
- you can be of some help.
- Of course.
Hold my coat. It's hot in here.
So this is where the printing plates are kept.
Very interesting...
No harm done.
Tell me, how many people have access to this vault?
Three persons only... myself, the Commissioner for Seals and Engravings, and the printing supervisor, Peter Giles.
I should like to speak to this, uh, third person.
He didn't turn up for work this morning.
We've already done some checking on this Giles.
He is a widower, with one child named Leslie.
I've seen her once or twice, myself.
A very pretty girl, in an unusual sort of way.
- Pretty?
- Oh, yes, sir. Quite.
Watson, make a note of that.
Though Mr. Giles himself seemed slightly uncomfortable when I complimented him on her appearance.
Surely you can't believe that
Peter Giles was involved!
The man's worked here for over thirty years, and he was very religious, too.
Wouldn't you say so, uh...
Hadlers, sir.
Oh, yes. He was always quoting from the Psalms.
The Psalms... one of my favorite books.
The... Bible, wasn't it?
I suppose you'll want to speak to this Peter Giles.
I've never been one for religious talk, myself.
On the other hand, no leads must be overlooked.
You can rest assured, your Lordship, we shall be investigating the daughter, as well.
I must be going.
Come here! You ninny, what are you doing over there?
Amazing fellow, really.
All right, now go! Go!
Open this door!
Giles, open the door.
It's Sherlock Holmes.
Stand back, I'll break it down.
Half a tick, Mr. Holmes.
You can't go walking into someone's residence, pokin' about their personal possessions, disturbin' their privacy.
That's for Scotland Yard.
Anybody home?
Nobody home.
- You're treading on the mat.
- Sorry.
Nice, tidy little place.
- A French postcard.
- Really?
I knew a chap who collected these once.
He had this wonderful one of two women...
- Oh. It's just the Eiffel Tower.
- Quite a bit of correspondence there.
I'd say Giles hadn't been home for several days.
Anything of interest in that card?
It says, "Having a gay time here, but need a holiday.
Will see you on Monday. L."
I wonder who that can be?
"L"... is that an old friend?
A secret lover?
It's my guess it's his daughter Leslie.
I'll wager you're right.
That's right... let him deduce everything.
When Lestrade returns, go about your sleuthing routine.
The full treatment?
Whatever it takes to keep him occupied while I look around.
It would appear as if Mr.
Giles has taken a holiday.
I expected no less.
If you'll allow me.
- Very interesting up here.
- Excuse me.
My word.
Don't touch that!
There may be fingerprints.
The book of Psalms...
As I anticipated... the Bible.
All starting to fit together rather neatly, I'd say.
Stay with me, Lestrade.
Investigating crime calls for the searching out of patterns.
Now, take the patterns in this carpet.
Rosettes and what appears to be cherubs.
Is that a cherub?
What have you there?
Oh, this.
I just found this in the fireplace.
Careful. Might be evidence.
Really?
"E-R-M-E-R-E."
What do you make of it?
Are you blind, Lestrade?
Tell him, Watson.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but this piece of paper is part of a map.
A location.
Emere...
Cashmere...
Windermere! Lake Windermere!
Brilliant!
The lake district is a perfect place to hide.
Nobody goes there this time of year.
We'll wire Windermere and see if Giles has made his appearance yet.
And don't you worry, Mr. Holmes... we'll have this case wrapped up in no time.
Unique, actually.
- So much for the great detective!
- Very creative, Watson.
Something that would never have occurred to the likes of me.
Imagine... a Sherlock
Holmes adventure in which Lestrade solves the bloody case!
Calm yourself.
There's a healthy chunk of mystery yet to be solved.
It's to Windermere for us, where, I assure you, the game is still afoot.
Where, I assure you, the game is still afoot.
"As was his habit, Sherlock Holmes sat in the railway carriage, lost in thought."
You must be a millionaire...
Are you Sherlock Holmes?
I am indeed, madam.
Would you like my autograph?
You put me old man in jail, you did!
"From these moments of quiet, intense reflection
"would inevitably spring some new insight."
Stop it, you silly girl!
Go on back!
Sorry about that.
- What are you doing?
- Thinking.
Right.
I'm gonna think, too.
What shall we think about?
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am the Right Honorable
Gerald Fitzwalter Johnson,
Lord Mayor.
This is my daughter Christabel.
Hello, Mr. Holmes.
We're enthusiastic readers of your articles in the Strand.
My daughter, in particular, reads each one several times.
Don't even think about it.
I believe we have something for you.
A man matching Mr. Giles's description arrived two nights ago.
This is Andrews, a dock worker here on the lake.
He remembers the man quite well.
Andrews, this is Mr. Holmes, come to our fair community to investigate a matter of great importance.
You may begin, Mr. Holmes.
What makes you remember this man so clearly, Mr. Andrews?
- I remember this man...
- Your hat.
I remember this man so clearly because he was carrying a brown leather suitcase.
The suitcase was fastened to his wrist with a pair of silver handcuffs.
It was very heavy, and he commented on the weight several times.
- He asked Donald Ayers...
- A local boatman. a local boatman, to transport him across the lake to a cottage he had rented.
Make a note of that.
I'm sure Holmes would like to speak to this boatman,
Donald Ayers.
Yes, indeed.
The thing of it is, no one has seen the fellow or the man with the suitcase since that night.
You mean they've gone missing?
My theory, if you'll permit me, is this... the storm may have done both of them in.
- They went out in a storm?
- Watson, please.
They went out in a storm?
The lake can get very rough at this time of the year.
Here we are, our finest hotel... the Shakespeare Arms.
We're all so proud to have you here.
The duke's absolutely beside himself.
- The duke?
- Uh, the d-o-g.
- Sherlock Holmes and Doctor...?
- John Watson.
Now, if you'll just follow me,
I'll have your luggage taken upstairs.
Stay down, now! Sit, boy, sit!
Now, then, Dukie, you stay down here while I take the gentlemen upstairs.
He's taken quite a fancy to you.
He doesn't like everybody, you know.
Fetch!
What he likes is the summer, with all them ramblers!
The King Lear Room... the finest we've got.
Yours is upstairs, Doctor.
Be careful of the carpet... the mice have been at it.
We call this the Hamlet Room, and it does have a lovely view of the lake.
Now, if you'll excuse me, Doctor...
Watson.
I'll just go and see if
Mr. Holmes is all right.
Would you mind swapping rooms with me?
I once played King Lear, and, quite frankly, that room would revive memories of rotten fruit.
One room's the same as another to me.
Thank you.
What a dreary place this is.
Excuse me, but you are
Sherlock Holmes, aren't you?
That depends.
Do you have a relative who was recently sent to prison?
Me? Why, no.
Yes, then. I am Sherlock Holmes.
We could all consider it an honor if you'd have a drink with us.
A drink.
I was just saying to my good friend Dr. Watson here what a lovely village this is.
I'll have a double whiskey.
Just to ward off the chill of the evening.
A double whiskey for
Mr. Holmes, please.
A toast... to the greatest detective in all the world.
Thank you, gentlemen. I am touched.
I can vouch for that.
You remind me of someone
I once encountered during the curious affair of the Manchurian Mambo.
Could I have a word?
I believe that was the
Manchurian Mamba.
Mamba, mambo... what's the difference?
Very little, other than one is a deadly poisonous snake, and the other is a rather festive Caribbean dance.
It was a night just like any other, when someone knocked at the door.
I opened it, and there were these Manchurians doing this rather festive
Caribbean dance.
Manchurian Mambo...
Steady, Watson.
Just get through it one more time, then you're rid of the fellow.
What a pleasant thought.
I feel much better.
Quite euphoric! as the snake struck at me,
I danced out of the way.
And if it hadn't been for my flawless footwork,
I'd be standing here a dead man today.
What about another drink?
I have to be up early tomorrow, and I need all my wits about me.
Perhaps just one more.
Holmes, sweet Holmes.
You're not the Hound of the
Baskervilles, you know.
Fresh air... that's what I need.
That's better.
Help!
Help me!
Watson, wake up!
Help!
My God!
Hang on, I'm coming!
Hang on, here I am!
Quickly!
Give me your hand.
- Are you there?
- Yes, I'm here.
Well done.
Pull, quickly! Pull harder!
Don't let go!
Well done.
Jolly good.
Oh, shit!
Fascinating... this railing appears to have been cut by someone.
Get him off!
Good morning, gentlemen.
This is the cottage Giles leased from a company in London.
Allow me to show you the way.
Mr. Mayor, don't move!
Not until Mr. Holmes has had a chance to inspect the area for clues.
By God, I've trained you well, Watson.
Now follow me closely.
- What am I looking for?
- Footprints.
Right.
- Have I found any yet?
- No, not yet.
Let me know when I do.
Hello? Anyone at home?
If Giles was headed here... it's obvious he never arrived.
They've found Donald Ayers.
Who?
Dreadful!
Stand back, lads. Leave it to me.
Constable, please.
Not until Mr. Holmes has had a chance to investigate the body for clues.
Yes... it is my opinion that he is dead.
He's a genius!
Thank you.
Here you are. Two first-class tickets to London.
Well, Mr. Holmes, any theories?
Indeed. Obviously Giles and
Ayers were caught in a storm too far from the shore to swim for it.
And with that heavy suitcase attached to his wrist, and the lake being so deep...
Quite. Pulled the poor wretch to the bottom.
Struggling futilely, flailing desperately as the cold, black water sealed his fate forever.
Well, it's certainly been a laugh.
Thank you very much.
We must be off. Pleasure meeting you, Mr. Mayor.
The same, Doctor.
Now... now...
We know for a fact that
Giles was on the boat.
No, we don't.
Oh.
Well, we do know for a fact that
Giles arrived at Windermere.
No, he didn't.
He didn't? I thought he did.
Well, we really know that Giles was behind the theft of the printing plates.
No, he wasn't.
Fine.
Just trying to get things straight.
Tell me something... is there anything we do know for a fact?
Yes.
What?
That without a doubt there is an evil mastermind behind all of this.
Professor Moriarty?!
Oh, for God's sake.
You didn't tell me that homicidal maniac was involved in this!
Because I knew you'd behave this way.
Bravo! Another triumph for deductive reasoning!
Don't you think you're overreacting?
Pardon me.
Wasn't I the one he tried to kill last night?
Merely a technicality.
- Maybe for you, mate.
- Think, man...
Who was supposed to sleep in that room?
That's true... you were!
Moriarty knows I'm the only match for his evil genius.
Are you sure he's not trying to kill me?
Of course not.
He knows you're an idiot.
Thank God.
Whoa, there. Steady.
Stand. Here you are, miss.
Thank you.
It's all very nice, miss.
Miss Leslie Giles?
Yes?
Dr. John Watson, at your service.
And this is Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
But what do you want with me?
The government suspects that your father has stolen the printing plates for the five pound note.
What?
They also believe he is at the bottom of Lake Windermere, drowned like a rat.
Father...
- Get some water, please.
- Of course.
Father...
Sorry for the fright, Miss Giles.
Unfortunately, you fainted before Holmes could add that he personally believes your father not only innocent, but alive.
Really?
Holmes believes your father has been abducted.
Abducted! By whom?
Abductors.
You see, Miss Giles, your father was described to us as fanatically neat... a fact confirmed by the immaculateness of this very place.
I took the opportunity to have a look around, and it is extremely tidy.
One must ask, therefore, why such a compulsively neat man would leave an unmade bed, unless he was snatched from that very bed.
Oh, dear God.
Then a man posing as your father was sent to Windermere where a mock drowning was staged, unfortunately costing the life of an innocent boatman named Ayers, forcibly drowned.
- Murdered.
- Why?
Why, you ask.
Because...
Fill in the details.
Because someone wanted us to believe that your father and the printing plates were lost at the bottom of the lake.
Thus Scotland Yard and that poor, misguided fool Lestrade would foolishly believe that the case was closed, leaving the true villain free to wreak havoc with the economy of the Empire.
All quite... elementary.
Let me go!
Have courage!
You're not getting away that easy!
Put me down!
You don't know who you're dealing with!
My name is Sherlock Holmes!
Look out!
Sorry about this, Miss Giles.
Sorry about this, Miss Giles.
- Hurry!
- My bleeding shoe!
- They're gone.
- I know. I chased them away.
You brave, brave man.
Danger is my trade... but not yours.
It's unsafe for you to sleep alone tonight... unattended.
Yes, we insist you stay with us.
- But surely I'd be an imposition.
- Think nothing of it, my dear.
Indeed, Holmes will be working all night anyway, so you can have his room.
Interesting... of
Italian manufacture.
What?
This shoe... brand-new.
Yes, very interesting.
Do you think... do you think she's ready for bed yet?
And if I'm not mistaken, caked with mud mainly found in the vicinity of the Thames.
The Thames, yes. Poor girl.
Poor, beautiful girl.
Some sleep would do her good.
I can picture her lying there, her eyes closed, gently breathing.
Her breasts heaving... as her supple, nubile young body... caresses the cool, limpid sheets...
Yes, the Thames it is.
Near Southwark... interesting, isn't it?
To say the least.
Why would common ruffians be wearing imported shoes?
Not secondhand, mind you, but brand-new.
- What was that?
- What?
If it's not one thing...
Oh, I'm sorry.
I suppose I must be still rather nervous.
You may rest easy. No one will disturb you tonight.
- Isn't that so?
- Quite.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were still asleep.
Sleep? Who can sleep when there's work to be done?
- Dr. Watson seems to have gone out.
- Really?
I wonder where.
Who knows?
He has very little patience with detective work.
Often becomes quite bored.
Your job must be very difficult.
One does get rather... tense.
I can imagine.
The hardest thing... is to find ways to relieve that tension.
So, you play the violin.
Only if worst comes to worst.
Well, I really don't want to add to that tension, so I think I'd better go and finish getting dressed.
No, please, I assure you...
An occasional break is quite refreshing.
My mind thrives on diversity.
What? What?
How many times have I got to tell you to knock?
Have you no respect for people's privacy?
Right! You've gone quite far enough, overstepping the bounds of propriety.
Come along, my dear. You'll be much safer with me.
- We'll have tea downstairs.
- Now, there's a good idea.
You have visitors.
Such carryings-on, and in the middle of the day.
This is a respectable
Presbyterian house, I assure you!
Take no notice.
The woman drinks a bit.
Come in, welcome.
Good morning.
I've informed Lord Smithwick of the findings in Windermere.
Though the case did not turn out as we hoped,
Her Majesty did insist on rewarding you for your efforts.
Who am I to go against the wishes of the Queen?
Stunning, isn't it?
I'm overwhelmed.
Pity you had to go all the way to Windermere merely to confirm my theories.
Think nothing of it. If I hadn't gone to Windermere,
I could not have confirmed my theories... namely, that your theories are completely wrong.
- What's that?
- This is utter nonsense.
He refuses to accept that I solved this case before he did.
Giles is dead, the plates lost, case closed.
Neither Giles nor the plates were ever in Windermere... case open.
- Really?
- What?
Well, gentlemen, I see Holmes has taken you into his confidence.
Did he also tell you that we expect to conclude this case within three days?
I'll let you fill in the details, Holmes.
Let me assure you, Lord Smithwick, that come... Friday, you shall have your plates.
You must succeed before news of the theft leaks out and causes widespread panic throughout the Empire!
Steady, sir.
That is exactly why the
Empire now more than ever needs all of us to remain calm and composed.
You're right, of course.
We must remain composed.
- Composed.
- And calm.
Friday? Are you out of your mind?
Steady on. You've made some excellent discoveries this morning.
Get your coat on.
We have a cab waiting.
- What discoveries?
- For one thing, the Royal Mint purchased its paper from the Camden paper mill.
You make these things up, don't you?
Those men were here about my father, weren't they?
Oh, good morning.
Is there any news, anything at all?
Sadly, no.
But take heart. Last night something occurred to Holmes, and he suddenly realized how stupid he'd been.
Really?
- I didn't exactly say "stupid."
- Yes, you did.
And now he's off to continue the investigation.
- Perhaps I could come, too.
- Ah. Now...
The moment he knows anything, he'll tell you.
- Thank you.
- Cabbie.
What's that?
A reply to a telegram
I sent late last night.
You might let me in on the joke, old boy.
In due time.
Cabbie, stop.
You was dead right, Doctor!
All of 'em, just sittin' there waitin' for customs.
Wonderful! Just as I thought!
Hop in, lad!
Driver, Southwark docks!
Thanks, guv'nor.
Wiggins.
Here they are.
- We found 'em here this morning.
- Wonderful.
All these crates full of imported shoes.
And the ship?
Got in this morning from Germany.
Two days late, she was.
Excellent. You've done well, my boy.
We'll take it from here.
Picture it... two, three, maybe four of Moriarty's henchmen waiting here under cover of darkness for that ship.
But it's delayed.
They wait. They become bored.
Being men of no moral fiber whatsoever, they can't resist helping themselves to a new pair of shoes.
Do you think they have these in brown?
I hate Italian shoes.
Moriarty.
- Moriarty?
- Without doubt.
- This one.
- All right.
What's "tinte"?
German for "ink."
He smuggled it in to avoid the attention of Scotland Yard.
Marvelous.
He already has the paper he needs.
He got it from The
Camden Paper Mill... burning the place to the ground to cover the theft.
The John Clay case was staged simply to throw me off the scent.
What's the German for "pen"?
What's all this?
Blast!
You can't be movin' things about.
It has to be cleared through customs.
Sorry, Professor. We thought the dock was deserted.
Sorry, indeed.
I went to all this trouble... for the sake of discretion.
Then you allow this to happen.
Well?
Do you have your revolver with you?
Yeah, somewhere.
Come on.
Let's not be all day about it.
Here it is.
Now, I'm gonna let you have some bullets for it.
Try not to shoot yourself... at least, not until
I give the signal.
Moriarty.
Damn.
What am I doing here?
Nobody told me Moriarty was...
- Holmes!
- What?
Come on!
Die, Moriarty.
Idiot!
Come on!
They can't follow us down the canal.
How demeaning to be set upon by nitwits.
What are you doing?
Damn!
Look out!
No luck, Sergeant.
- Anything?
- No, sir.
The tide may have carried the body miles downriver.
Is it true?
I'm afraid it's true.
I am so sorry.
He was such a good man.
I can't believe he's gone.
I know it's difficult at such a time, but if it's any consolation, we still have Mr. Holmes.
Did I say something wrong?
I seem to have overestimated the amount of rope required.
One more thing I've botched.
What would Dr. Watson say?
He'd have volunteered to kick the chair out from under me!
He would not!
He said this was gonna be our last case together.
You mustn't blame yourself.
You can still avenge the doctor's death by capturing this Moriarty and rescuing my father.
Oh, what a good idea.
While I'm at it, I'll bring in the Loch Ness Monster.
I don't understand!
I am not a detective.
I never solved anything.
Dr. Watson did.
You're just upset.
I couldn't detect horse manure if I stepped in it.
Please, Mr. Holmes!
Sorry.
- Another one?
- Yes, please.
Stop.
Perhaps not.
I'm afraid my grief... has exceeded my resources.
- It's on the house.
- Thank you, Henry.
Thank goodness!
Mrs. Hudson said we might find you here.
We want to offer you our condolences.
Pity about Dr. Watson.
I trust, however, it will have no bearing on the outcome of the case.
What?
You vowed to solve the case by Friday.
Well, you see, the fact of the matter is, you see, Lord Smithwick, is... Dr. Watson...
I believe what Mr. Holmes is trying to say is that it was Dr. Watson who first made that pledge, and... with all due respect,
I'm sure he did not fully understand the complexities of the case.
As I have tried to point out to Your Lordship,
Her Majesty should rely on the counsel of trained criminologists such as myself.
Though well-meaning, the good doctor was... no detective.
As I was about to say, Lord Smithwick,
Dr. Watson was decidedly precise in his estimate of the closure of this case.
Have no fear... you shall have the plates in your hands come Friday.
What?
The game's afoot!
Dr. Watson always said, start by listing everything you know.
So, let us begin.
Number one.
Moriarty.
Isn't he wonderful?
He is behind all this, that's one thing we know.
Very good. Progressing nicely.
Now, the next thing we know... number two.
This might take a while.
I'll get some tea.
What?
All right... let's go back to number one.
Perhaps the clue is in Moriarty's name.
Clever people often do that.
Amity... rarity...
I've got it!
His real name is Arty Morty!
What the hell am I talking about?
I found a five pound note floating in the river.
Lucky you.
But it's only half printed!
I suppose it's only worth two pounds-ten, then.
Everyone knows the normal five pound note carries a serial number which contains five digits.
- Six digits.
- Six digits.
This one contains only three.
- Two-three-four.
- What's that mean?
Her father's a printer, ain't he?
Maybe he's trying to tell us where he is.
What can these numbers mean?
Could be a measurement... an address!
- An amount!
- A page number!
Did your father have a favorite book?
He did!
- The Bible.
- Yes.
I have a Bible. It's at my bedside.
Is there something on page 234?
Page numbers vary from Bible to Bible, but chapter and verse is the same in every Bible.
Did your father have a favorite book of the Bible?
Yes, he did.
The book of Psalms.
Psalms 23rd, verse four.
"Yea, though I walk through the valley of... the shadow of death."
Does that mean something?
That means... the Orpheum Theater.
What are you talking about?
I'm sorry, but I just don't understand.
The Shadow of Death.
The gripping drama was the last play presented at the Orpheum.
It closed after only one night, but not without garnering some praise.
Harris, in the Daily Telegram. Said,
"In an otherwise dismal evening,
Reginald Kincaid provided some welcome laughs."
Laughs? You said it was a gripping drama.
It's unimportant now, isn't it?
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
- Cab!
- Oh, dear.
The Fleet River runs under that part of town.
The Orpheum Theater stands right on top of it.
You could be on to something.
There's tunnels and caverns running all under there.
- Just a moment!
- We haven't got a moment!
Wiggins, fetch Scotland Yard.
Let me, Mr. Holmes.
I'm sure they'll be much more inclined to listen to me.
Good idea. Wiggins, on the back.
The Orpheum Theater.
We haven't a moment to lose!
I kind of liked you better when you was a coward.
The stage door's round back. Go ahead.
- You go ahead.
- Wiggins, go ahead.
Here ya go, gents.
Here you go, my good man.
You may keep the change.
A fiver? God bless ya, guv'nor!
Think nothing of it.
I print my own.
"Print me own"... that's a good one.
Still, we can't afford to waste them.
We shall move the barge out at high tide.
I shall miss this place... somewhat.
Go around front.
When the police get here, tell them what happened.
Right you are.
And... the best of British luck to you both. You're gonna need it.
And don't move until they get here!
Up we go.
- Hold on to that.
- Slowly.
Where are we?
Don't kick the...
- bucket.
Let go.
Are you quite serious?
Do you do this kind of thing on purpose?
Listen.
It's nothing, Professor.
Probably rats.
Ah, yes... rats.
I think...
I think it's louder over here.
It might...
I am so dreadfully sorry.
On the contrary,
I think we're making very good progress.
There's a hole in the wall.
I'm not stayin' around here.
Blimey.
Well, well.
The ink's not dry yet.
There's more paper line over here.
Hand over.
You've done a splendid job, Mr. Giles.
The Queen herself could hardly tell the difference.
However... this one seems to have been only half printed.
It was found on the bank of the river.
I've got a pussycat
And I'm very fond of that
A reject.
Must have slipped away.
And the tide carried it out.
The tide, that's all.
Suppose we have a look at this reject.
Shall we?
Two-three-four...
Oh, yes. Clever.
How many of these rejects accidentally slipped away?
Well, I...
No matter.
Shame that the only person capable of deducing your clue is currently lying at the bottom of the Thames.
What are you doing here?
I told you to keep an eye on that imbecile!
- He may yet stumble onto something.
- He has.
They know all about this place.
Luckily for you, they sent me to fetch Scotland Yard.
- All right, no Scotland Yard. Fine.
- What now, Professor?
No need to panic.
I need a good plan.
Attack!
Attack with what?
That's no good.
Start packing!
In spite of this latest piece of foolishness, you've done your job well.
Your reward will be a quick and relatively painless departure.
Not so fast, Moriarty.
I've been waiting hours for your arrival.
- Thank God you're here!
- Please, my dear.
Ingenious, planting a spy in our midst.
That staged attack at
Giles' was quite realistic.
However, a cable to France revealed a rather unique fact about the real Miss Giles... something of an embarrassment to the Giles family, I should think.
Perhaps you would like to meet the real Lesley Giles.
Lesley!
All right, back to the first plan... attack.
Pity you won't be able to share my greatest triumph... the forcing of an empire to its knees.
But you will be allowed to see these two die... before you.
Right!
Don't anybody move.
Otherwise, there'll be an impromptu roasting.
Has it occurred to you, Mr. Holmes, that if you set fire to that money, you will burn to death yourself?
You will burn to death yourself?
Of course it has.
Put out those flames!
Don't just stand there!
Look out!
- I thought you were dead.
- You may yet be right.
I'm not done with you yet!
- Put sand on it!
- Bring more buckets!
- Get some water in here!
- Clear those boxes!
Leave this to me.
There, there, my dear.
We're in a tinderbox!
What was that?
You cowards!
- Professor, the gas mains!
- What?
They could blow in the heat!
Keep them pinned down.
I'll get the plates.
It's all over now, my pretty one.
You're disappointed, aren't you?
Hell!
Brilliant.
Why didn't you kill him when you had the chance?
Rock of ages
Cleft for me
Let me hide
Myself in thee
Rock of age...
Go on, hurry up!
- Get movin'!
- Come on, George!
- Let's get out of here!
- The back door!
It's safe, Professor.
Come on.
This is an escape, not a cakewalk.
Oh, please... don't wait for me, will you?
Mercy me!
Oh, my dear... that must have been so painful!
Hello?
All right...
There he is!
- You hold them off.
- Just like I told ya.
Oh, my head.
It's all right, dear.
It's still there.
- Sorry, Mrs. Hudson.
- Watson, there's a fire down here.
It became necessary for me to stage my death so I might work unobserved for a few days.
And I must say, you've caused quite a bit of grief.
You needn't bother with her... she's an imposter.
She's not Leslie Giles?
Then who is?
I am.
There you have it.
Ladies and gentlemen... you seem to be blocking my exit.
Kindly step aside.
Remove these people from the stage.
They're locked.
Ordinarily I do not bother with half-wits and buffoons.
Buffoon, is it?
Buffoons, is it?
- He'll be killed!
- I quite doubt it.
He's in his element now.
I warn you... I've killed as many as six men in a week.
Eight, if you count matinees.
"The brilliant swordsmanship of Reginald Kincaid...
...was almost worth the price of admission," raved the critic of the...
Cotswold Press.
All right, put your shoulders to it, men.
Let's have it down. The rest of you, round the back.
He really is quite good.
- Follow me.
- Follow him, lads!
Trying to be funny, eh?
Hold on! Don't anybody move!
The authorities are here!
Stay where you are, everyone.
Get down!
Right.
I have killed before, and I can assure you I have absolutely no compunction about doing so again.
You are not dealing with an amateur, you know.
Well played.
Once more unto the breach, dear friends.
You're alive!
Astounding observation,
Inspector... we must discuss it.
Well done!
Stand back!
I'm about to bring the world's greatest criminal to justice, and nothing's going to stop me!
Have you forgotten the gas mains?
More pressure! Come on, boys!
More water! Come on!
Congratulations!
Her Majesty wishes to offer you her sincerest appreciation for a job well done.
And you too, Dr. Watson.
Mr. Giles tells me that you both deciphered the clue.
I doubted if anyone would understand it.
Child's play.
- 23rd Psalm.
- Shadow of death.
Elementary.
No, no, no... I was referring to the serial number... 234.
The address of the theater...
234 Beacon Street.
Amazing!
Don't worry, I'll fix it in the story.
The arrests were made, and the rest of the story you know.
Don't mean to toot my own horn, you understand.
Nice bit of work, this. But as I was telling Miss Giles, had it not been for the timely arrival of Scotland Yard,
I doubt things would have turned out so well.
Of course, I realize you would never admit such a thing.
On the contrary.
Indeed, Holmes was telling me how indispensable you were.
- He was?
- As a matter of fact, it is to Lestrade, and Lestrade alone, that you owe your deepest gratitude.
Really?
Miss Giles is on the stage, you know, in Paris.
A revue called Les Femmmes Faux.
An actress... what a surprise.
There's more surprises yet to come.
Good morning!
Excuse me, sir. Is it true that Moriarty is dead?
Never assume, gentlemen, never assume.
How did you know where
Moriarty was hiding out?
It was an elementary deduction based on the clues at hand.
But how is it that
Scotland Yard did not...
Perhaps...
Perhaps Scotland Yard did not have the invaluable assistance, the keen insight and the extraordinary patience... of Dr. John Watson.
My friend.
Hear, hear!
Now, gentlemen and ladies,
I have an announcement of some consequence.
With the safe return of the plates to the Royal Mint,
I must inform you that this is my last case.
Sherlock Holmes is retired.
Surely not, sir. That cannot be!
Is it possible?
Of course it's not possible.
Mr. Holmes is merely pulling your leg.
Aren't you?
Sherlock Holmes retire, when there is murder and mayhem at every turn?
Already several adventures have begun to take shape which can be solved by no one else. Right?
Right you are.
And so, without further ado,
I hereby declare this case... closed.
[male] In the rolling hills of a simple farm community untouched by time, a gruesome secret has been protected for generations.
[motor starts up]
Hey!
- I brought you a surprise.
- A surprise, huh?
I love you.
Faith stowaway often at this farm.
Oh! Get away from me,
William Gluntz.
Ugly, Hittite pig brain.
- Stop it, Gluntz!
- Incubus.
You retard!
[Gluntz] Incubus.
- [girl yells]
- Servant of the incubus.
Ma!
William, William!
Hell fire to the incubus!
Hell fire to you, Hittite!
Get back where you belong, William.
You're gonna be in trouble with Isaiah.
Infidel.
He chasin' you again?
He broke my paints, Ma.
I'll get ya some more.
Get on back home, Faith.
Go on.
You, know, uh--
William never really hurt anybody.
Tell that to Faith.
Every time she comes near that place that Gluntz idiot starts chasin' her like he was some kinda guard dog or somethin'!
Of course, I know it ain't nothin' you can help.
Well, you tell her she's welcome over here.
Well, I like her at home.
Out of people's hair.
Anyways, you have my thanks.
Okay, in a while we'll be calling on you for somethin'.
You do midwifin', don'tcha?
Hey, don't say-- when?
It won't be until spring sometime.
Well, I hope it's a girl.
Boys ain't nothin' but trouble.
Incubus!
She incubus!
Whoa.
Uh!
Ow.
We have no use for that kind of machinery.
So do not covet what he has.
He is dead.
Do you understand?
Yes, Father, I understand.
I'm sorry.
Damn it.
Damn, damn, damn, damn!
[female] Faith?
Faith!
You hear me callin' you?
Dinner's ready.
Sorry, Lou, I guess I'm just too busy thinkin' about what I'm doin'.
I think--
I think girls should-- paint their nails.
Not stuff like this.
Lots a girls paint, Momma.
There ain't no shame to it.
Wait 'til you see the next one
I'm gonna do.
It's gonna be my masterpiece, that's all.
[male] Martha, what are you up to?
What's this?
Thanks-- for the best anniversary
I've had so far.
It's not surprising since it's our first.
New manure spreader?
Portable.
We'll save the bow.
Already we're history, right?
Nice suit. [chuckles]
Poppa knew this would happen if he let me go off.
Glad you went anyway?
Glad your stuck out in the country with your crazy Hittite?
Ex Hittite.
What's wrong?
Oh, just a little, uh, trouble with the tractor.
I pulled the wheels off.
I may go out and pack the bearings a little later.
You're a little bombed, no?
- Poo.
- Who's bombed?
Besides, isn't there--
Isn't there anything else you can do tonight except pack bearings?
Hmm?
[dog barks]
[door creaks]
[dog barks]
[tractor starts]
[motor stops]
[chicken cackles]
[cackles]
[tractor starts]
What the hell are you--
Jim?
You in here?
[gasps]
[cries out]
Jim, Jim?
Ain't no need for you to wait any longer, Mam.
I'll stay 'til you're through.
They usually do that when one of their own dies.
Funny.
He kin to them?
Kin.
Evil one is among us.
Do you believe she calls and tells us not to come?
That's Martha.
Turn here.
I never thought she'd isolate herself so much.
[sighs] Who are these Hittites anyway,
Amish or what?
No, no connection.
According to Martha, the Hittites make the Amish look like swingers.
Ain't no way we're gonna get in there.
There's always a way, if you want one.
Will, you gonna do it?
Or are you afraid your girlfriend's gonna come around and catch ya?
Ain't my girlfriend.
Nah, you just come around and peek in her window.
Watch it.
Okay.
Father Isaiah said this place was with the incubus.
If he knew--
Now who's chickens?
You get blue, you just call me.
I'm sorry that it-- it took this for us to get to know each other a little better.
- Thanks.
- It's nothin'.
Wow, big as a house.
I gonna look.
- Dare you to touch the blood.
- Dare you.
Double dare goes first.
[chickens cackle]
[yells]
Honey, we thought you heard us.
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
[cackling]
[dog barks]
[female] Do you have a clear deed to this place?
Did Jim leave a will?
Jim was very careful.
He'd just inherited this farm when he got into a big fight with his father, Isaiah.
Well, what happened, anyway?
Jim was the first Hittite to go away to school-- to the city.
Isaiah was furious to begin with.
And then when Jim came back with me...
Isaiah kicked him out of the family.
He forbid anyone to even talk with us.
Called me the incubus.
What's an incubus?
Some sort of a devil that seduces the faithful in his sleep.
Or it just comes after you and takes you like a beast.
Oh, God.
It's been an awful shock.
You'll feel better when we get you back to L.A.
I'm not going anywhere at least until spring.
Just stay with me for a week and I'll be all right.
I love you both.
To old friends.
You know what the cost of a shoe is?
I was fetchin' the calves to feed.
Caught in the mud.
My foot was stuck in mud and when I pulled it out my shoe came off.
There is no mud on the shoe you have.
I washed it, so--
More than the cost of the shoe is the cost of the lie.
I will go get it.
- If I could find it.
- You will find it.
If it takes all night.
And while you are searching, keep in mind the wages of sin!
Whoa.
Matthew, it is best I speak to this one.
Yes?
I have come only to speak for one of my people.
[Matthew] It's my boy.
He went out yesterday.
He lost one of his shoes and I told him to go find it.
But he never returned.
I've asked everyone.
Have you seen him?
William?
- The big boy?
- Oh, yes.
This must have been yesterday-- in the evening maybe.
I'm sorry.
If-- if you see him--
If I see him, I'll drive him by.
Where's your farm?
- By the river, just by the--
- Matthew, Matthew, you see how the glib serpent's tongue deceives you?
Would you put your son in her ungodly machine?
If it would bring him home.
She is with incubus.
She could not speak the truth if she knew it.
Go.
Wait by the wagon.
I will have one more word with her.
If you should see the boy before me,
I am the elder.
One more word.
I, too, have lost a son.
I am certain in my heart he would want this land to stay with his people.
His people.
His people turned their backs on him.
You ordered it.
Our people are prepared to offer a good price.
A very good price.
You want your answer right away?
If you like.
May you be damned in hell!
[Martha] I shouldn't have let him get to me like that.
If I owned a piece of property like this and I kicked the bucket, my parents would start building condos on it on the way home from the funeral.
Lana!
Chow!
Stop shouting, I'm up.
Yeah.
How's the champ?
I'm fine.
Vicky's done everything but inject me with chicken soup. [chuckles]
- How are you?
- I'm okay.
You're up before noon.
You must be sick.
Just couldn't sleep, that's all.
And when I finally did get to sleep, I--
I had this really awful nightmare.
I dreamed about this man whose skin was all gray like ash.
Came to my door and--
This house?
No, just-- just a house in a dream.
Anyway, he came and he banged on the door.
And he just said my name...
[whispers] real quiet.
"Lana, Lana..."
Lana, what a bummer you can be.
Well, then I took this big cannon and I aimed it right at the door
And it didn't go off, naturally.
No, it did.
But when the smoke cleared... he was still there.
Just... changed.
How did he change?
He'd--
He'd become a spider.
He--
He whispered my name again.
[whispers] But this time right in front of my face.
Said it like a lover would say it.
[whispers] "Lana."
I woke up in a cold sweat.
It's a cold room.
I should have put you in with Vicky.
I'm so pissed off at you,
Lana Marcus.
Well, we came here to cheer up Martha, not make her so depressed that she wants to blow her brains out.
God, you're right, I'm sorry.
It's okay.
You can choose to look at the shadows or you can choose to look at the light.
- [gasps and screams]
- Jesus.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to peek.
Can I come in?
Look how many I brought you.
They're all grade A large too.
And we'll never miss 'em.
Fact, I'm sick a eggs.
I really am.
It's eggs this, eggs that.
Sometimes I'd rather eat dirt.
Here, these are for you.
Now, don't you worry
'cause I candled all of them.
There ain't gonna be no little beady eyes staring up at you outta your sunny-side ups.
Uh, terrific.
You're Louisa Stohler's daughter, right?
Mm-hmm, I'm Faith.
F-A-I-T-H, like in believe.
Faith, uh, this is Lana and Vicky.
And I'm Martha.
It's nice to meet you all.
You're not a Hittite, are you?
No, I ain't a Hittite.
And don't ever say that,
I hate 'em.
We ain't even farmers.
Ma's a waitress.
Oh, those damn Hittites.
All they done is try to run us outta here like they done everybody else.
My momma won't budge.
Just like you don't, Martha.
Well, gotta scoot.
I'll bring ya some more eggs real soon.
That's fine, but we have plenty now.
Oh it's-- it's no trouble.
Okay, you bring 'em.
Boy, I bet you miss him a lot, huh?
I had a pet once.
It was just this dumb old bird with a broken wing.
Next thing I knew he was dead.
Cried and cried for him all night.
Just like I would for a brother.
I know how it is.
Please don't do that.
I like your room a lot.
It's real nice.
Are, uh-- are those two visitors?
They'll be stayin' a while.
Oh.
Come on, gang.
Come on, I'll beat you to the wagon.
[growls]
Hey.
Hey!
Hey is this--
[yelps]
[horse blows]
Hi.
Where is your red car?
How'd you know I had a red car?
I saw it yesterday on the road.
By Jim's farm.
You know Jim?
Martha's Jim?
Jim was my brother.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.
We rejoice for the dead.
Hey, they are in a better place.
I'm John Schmidt.
Vicky Anderson.
[horse blows]
You didn't think he was so terrible, did you?
My father shunned him for leaving the way.
What my father says will always be the law.
But he was my brother.
Well, I guess I better go.
Why?
I feel like I've been through a time warp.
There's no cars, no jets.
No telephone poles or power lines.
What is a warp?
That's when somebody from the 20th century wakes up one morning back in the 18th century.
This century's more peaceful, I think.
Really.
[horse whinnies]
- What's wrong?
- It's my father.
John?
You do not work?
No. I mean yes, Father.
Something troubled you?
- No, Father.
- We were just talking, sir.
These things are not for us.
John.
You'll be working now, ya?
- Yes.
- Ah.
I'm Vicky Anderson,
I'm a friend of Martha's.
We are the kindred of God.
We have no business with the serpents.
A field is all, ya?
Yes, Father.
Your cousin is a sound woman.
You are to shun the rest.
You understand?
Yes, Father, I understand.
Git up!
Hey!
Hey, hold it!
Hey!
Foot worked loose.
Got another?
Yeah, in the barn.
Well, where is it?
I'll get it.
Thanks.
It's, uh, back where we park the tractor-- there's a toolbox.
Here, you'll need this.
[door creaks]
[chickens cackle]
[door bangs]
[cackling louder]
[tractor starts]
Vicky.
Vicky, if you think this is funny, it's not.
[cackling]
Martha! Martha!
[cackling]
[sobs]
[clattering]
Vick?
[whimpers]
Vick?
[creaking]
Vick, you back?
Ah!
[screams]
[Martha] Lana?
You need help with that?
[sighs] Oh.
[screams]
He said he ain't gonna let me touch him.
Never harmed no one.
He was touched.
You didn't have to hurt him.
Mr. Gluntz, you don't think
I killed William?
Mr. Gluntz, there's no use making accusations
'til we have an autopsy or--
I'll never let you put your knives on my boy.
He's suffered enough.
Sheriff, this is our affair.
We will bury William.
You want me to find who did that or not?
We already know who did this.
- Who?
- The incubus.
Your laws cannot crush the incubus.
Ours can.
Take him home, Matthew.
Well, I'll be damned.
These boys eat brimstones for breakfast, I swear.
If I was you, I'd get out tonight.
I'll come back with you tomorrow and get your things.
Meanwhile, I'll get a court order and look at that body.
You want me to run just because you can't find a killer?
Your friend said he was hangin'.
You found him in the straw.
She goes on about death running after her wearing a black bathrobe or something.
On the other hand, if someone did do it, it wasn't someone you'd want to tangle with, believe me.
If something happens,
I ain't gonna be here in time for nothin' but cleanup.
[car starts]
[whispers] Are you okay?
Never felt better.
Did the sheriff find any clues?
No.
What did this person look like?
[whispers] What person?
The one you saw in the barn.
There was nobody there.
Just me.
Maybe you two better go back.
Why don't we just wait and see what the sheriff finds out.
Okay.
[footsteps]
Hey.
How ya doin'?
Okay.
Did you get some sleep?
Not much.
Do you want to play some backgammon?
Sure.
Martha's in the tub, huh?
Yeah, she's got the right idea.
Okay.
[water running]
Lana?
Hey, if anyone wants to use this, just sing out.
Touch me there again and I'll scream.
What is it?
[beating]
What happened?
Bed, huh,
I'm going back to bed.
[door closes]
What was it?
[choir singing]
John, what are you doing out here?
The meeting has begun.
I wanted some air.
Isaiah's back.
You should come inside.
He expects you there.
You are the eldest son now.
[singing continues]
[singing ends]
This is a most grievous day.
[sobs]
An incubus has crept into our fold and defiled our flock.
William Gluntz, an innocent man-child is dead.
Killed by the messenger of the incubus.
Death came to William.
Death took him.
Because someone took him to that forbidden place.
Who?
Remember that lying is the sin of the serpent.
And the wages of sin are death!
Leopold Smith step forward.
Leopold Smith, kneel and confess thy wrongdoing.
I went into the forbidden barn.
I... have shamed us all.
And more.
It was me who dared him to go into the barn.
I humbly ask God for forgiveness.
[sobs]
We shall make it impossible for the incubus to rest comfortably in your soul.
One we have lost.
Another shall we save.
[congregation]
Amen.
If thine eye offends thee, pluck it out.
If thine hand offends thee, then in God's name cut it off!
Is that usual, snakes coming into houses?
Oh, it happens enough.
Morning, Mrs. Schmidt.
Morning, Sammy.
Fill the tank and this.
Okay, Stretch?
- Coming?
- Yeah, in a minute.
I've just got some business in here I gotta take care of.
I think I'll, uh, get a lot of-- about ten lbs. of chocolate.
What do you think?
Used to work every time.
[horse neighs]
Hey, uh, you want me to come over with you?
Just wait a sec.
That's okay,
I'm not afraid a Hittites.
At least, not all of them.
That one is good.
This one is proper.
You think?
Whatever you like, Melissa.
[cash register rings]
Why don't you surprise me?
I'll fetch the flour while you choose.
[horse and buggy passes]
[stutters]
About what happened yesterday--
We're really not that unfriendly.
[whispers]
Well.
Isaiah should not have treated you that way.
That's all right.
I suppose, to your father, jogging shorts and a t-shirt make me a Jezebel.
You know about Jezebel?
You wanna do somethin' some time?
Well, just a movie or something.
I think the one in town's
Lassie Meets Godzilla.
Can't be sinful.
And nobody will know.
I knew it.
Melissa, Melissa.
Melissa.
I'm sorry.
Melissa.
Say it.
She's prettier than I am.
She's not.
No.
Swear it.
I'll never talk to her again.
I was weak.
It's just hard waiting.
You better take me home.
It's you I want, not her.
I can't.
[ripping]
[cries]
[grunts]
What's that for?
What are you up to?
Oh, my God.
What, has war been declared or what?
Where did you get that thing?
Got it from Sammy back at Coopers Junction.
Oh, [chuckles] Stretch.
Anyway, uh, I told him about the snake and, uh, also told him
I was an old hand at this.
Here.
You fire guns before?
No.
No?
Oh, good grief.
Well... doesn't take an Einstein to pull a trigger.
See that green bottle right there?
Oh, God.
- Oh, I'm deaf.
- What?
I got it, though.
Here.
[sighs]
You don't think it would have bounced off, do you?
Wait a minute.
What are you aiming at?
Paint can.
Not gonna to take any chances.
It's just about the size of a man's chest.
[whispers]
Squeeze.
[gunshot]
Melissa?
Who did this?
You will follow me to the barn.
- But Father--
- Obey!
I need to talk.
You need the fear of God in thee.
- Kneel.
- Father--
Kneel!
Father?
No!
You're cursed.
No more.
Please.
Go!
You are a stench in the nostrils of God!
The devil has you now!
Melissa, come with me and we'll talk.
She is too pure to hear the devil.
All our hearts and ears are stone to you now.
Your brother will not look at you.
Your mother will never feed you again.
You are not of us now-- go.
Go to thy whore.
Go.
Join your brother in hell!
I gotta get out of the house for a while.
You'll be okay?
We're fine.
[sighs] Okay.
Get outta here.
All right.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Stay outta trouble.
I always try.
[clunk]
[knocking]
Who is it?
Louisa Stohler.
Hi, Louisa.
Can I come in?
Oh, sure.
Sorry.
Left your hat in my truck.
- Oh, thanks.
- Mm-hmm.
Come on in.
Thanks.
Louisa, this is my friend Lana.
And Vicky you just missed.
Uh, pleased to make your acquaintance, Lana.
Nice to meet you.
- Sit down.
- Oh, thanks.
Louisa's Faith's mother.
- You remember Faith?
- Yeah.
Yeah, well, it's kinda hard to forget her.
Once you've said hello, she goes on so.
And that's partly why I come down.
I thought maybe she might a snuck down here.
Started getting in your hair.
Well, she's been very generous with the eggs.
So that's where they disappeared.
I'll go get the basket.
I'm sorry about all the trouble down here.
I don't suppose the sheriff's been much good.
No, as a matter of fact, all he does is tell us to get out.
Well, I wouldn't be surprised if he was a Hittite hisself.
Men around here is hopeless.
Well, I guess my old man made me hate the whole breed.
[sighs] Yeah, as soon as Faith was born he was over the fence and gone.
I swear, if Faith had been a boy,
I think I'd a just stuck her in the river like sack a kittens.
Here.
Listen, I hope you don't scold Faith for coming by.
No.
No, there's nothing personal.
I just like to keep an eye on 'er.
She's so dumb.
She couldn't pour piss from a boot if the instructions was printed on the heel.
Well.
Nice you came by.
Watch the Hittites.
[whispers]
Watch 'em.
I mean, if you're gonna stay, you gotta watch 'em.
'Course, your Jim, he was different.
Bye.
Thank you.
John?
What are you doing here?
Huh.
You didn't drive your buggy
30 miles, did you?
I hitched.
Hiked and I hitched.
What's wrong?
Something happened?
No.
It's just some trouble between my father and me.
Come on.
I'll drive you back.
We'll talk.
[gravelly voice]
Lana.
Open your mouth.
Wider.
[coughing, gasps]
Hey.
You all right?
Just a... bad dream.
Something got in my throat.
[sighs] Scare you?
What, who me?
I knew it.
You're just as scared as I am.
It's all a big front.
Just look at you.
You're shaking.
I'm not scared.
It's just--
Just what?
Well, it's just there's a draft in here or something.
[female screams]
[Rod Stewart sings "Maggie May" on the radio]
[gears grind]
This is wonderful.
This is much better than a horse.
It's much better to even try it, don't you think?
Thanks for listening.
Whoa!
Oh, close, but no cigar.
I guess I'm not so good a driver.
You kidding?
For your first time, you did great.
Well, wh-- what is it you do to start it running again?
What's your hurry?
Huh?
Oh.
Is this, uh--
Is this where we say we've run out of gas?
Could.
John!
John.
[distant howl]
What?
Something I did?
No, I just thought
I saw something out there.
There's nothing out there.
Everyone around here goes to bed by dark.
[snap]
That's probably a raccoon or opossum.
Maybe we should go.
Not at all, I'll go--
I'll chase it away.
- John, don't.
- Don't worry.
[whispers]
John!
Did you see anything?
Only ghosts and goblins.
[kissing]
[yelling]
John.
[whispers]
John.
No!
Don't worry, she'll be home soon.
Even when we were in college
I used to sit up like a mother hen.
Hey, how 'bout let me fix you a snack?
Peanut butter and jelly sandwich might be nice.
Big glass of milk?
Okay, you got it.
Hey, would you like this on toast?
No.
Oh!
Lana?
Lana, listen, stop it.
Oh, he did this to me.
Someone's idea of a joke, maybe.
Just don't freak out on me, come on.
It's no use.
You can't lock him out.
He comes in whenever he wants.
What are you talking about?
Death.
He's after me.
Jesus, Lana.
Just get a hold a yourself.
He tried to get me in the barn.
Martha, I saw him.
I wasn't dreaming.
Please don't do this.
He spoke to me like in my dream.
Just reaches out and touches your--
Don't!
Just go sit down.
I'm going to go into the bedroom and check the windows.
For what, if there's nothing to be afraid of?
Go sit down.
Jim.
[screams]
Faith.
[cries out]
[screams]
[female] I command thee whosoever thou art, thou unclean spirit, and all my companions possessing this land.
Divine mystery of the incarnation, resurrection in the century of our Lord, Jesus Christ.
By the sending of the Holy Ghost and by the coming of our Lord to judgment, count on me thy name, the date and the hour of thy coming out.
[gasps]
I command!
Louisa!
[screams]
Can't let you go now, little bird.
[screams]
I wouldn't a hurt you.
I only hurt the ones that were keeping us apart.
[screaming]
I tried to be a little girl, Lou.
I tried so hard.
I ain't got no secret no more.
Not if she lives.
Tried to kill her, didn't ya?
You put the snake after her.
Hey, listen, she come to me and she laughed about you.
Yeah, yeah, she could tell.
She could tell that you were-- that you was half and half.
She laughed at you.
She laughed and laughed and laughed at you!
No, she did not, my Martha.
She's not yours!
She can't be, never will be.
She's carrying his child.
You ain't never gonna have her-- never.
Lana?
- Lana.
- What?
Get up quick.
- What?
- Give me the gun.
Come on.
Why?
Gotta get out.
Where are we going?
To the truck.
It's him, it's him!
Get off!
Uh!
I'm sorry.
[gunshot]
Operator.
Operator, this is an emergency.
I've gotta keep--
[horse whinnies]
[wagon wheels rolling]
[screams]
[groans and screams]
Melissa.
Messenger of the incubus is dead.
Sure you don't want to come back with me?
The seed's planted.
I stay.
Bye.
[car starts]
[whispers]
Martha.
Beware.
Beware of the incubus.
Jim?
[creaking from below]
[howl]
[male] The beast that thou sawest was and is not.
And shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition.
And they that dwell on the earth shall wonder.
THE TIME MASTERS
Why are you going so fast?
It's just for fun
Hello, Jaffar?
Calling Jaffar
Claude here. Answer me!
Come in!
- Who are you talking to?
- Jaffar?
This is Claude.
Where are you?
Can you read me?
I'll leave a message
Jaffar, this is Claude
I'm calling from the planet Perdide
Northern hemisphere, 73rd sector
Jaffar, the hornets attacked us by surprise!
It was horrible
Annie is dead
I'm heading for the Dolongs
Jaffar, I've crashed
I'm trapped. I'm sending Piel into the Dolongs with a microphone
Come get him, for God's sake!
Hurry!
I beg you!
Goodbye, Jaffar...
...and thank you
Claude
Here, Piel. Catch this
- What is it?
- It's a toy that can speak
- Is this a toy?
- Yes, it's a microphone
Call it Mike.
Mike is a friend of yours
When Mike talks to you, you must do exactly what he says
Now run as fast as you can to the Dolongs...
...and stay there until the machine...
...until Mike... talks to you
I can't run. My knee hurts
Anyway, I don't want to go into the Dolongs
I want to go home
Your mummy doesn't want us to come home right now
Do as I say!
Run into the Dolongs
Run, I tell you! Run!
Well done, very nice!
What's the matter?
- You idiot
- What's got into you?
What are you doing?
Look what's happening
We almost collided with that meteor while you were taking a nap
I thought the collision-swerve control was automatic
Yes, but only for masses that weigh less than 10,000 tons
Well, I didn't know
You don't know much
Hello
I have refreshments for the navigators
- Is anything wrong?
- No, it's all good
You must be joking!
How long has this signal been on?
How should I know? I don't understand anything about this tub of yours
Jaffar, this is Claude
Where are you?
Can you read me?
I'll leave a message
Jaffar, this is Claude
I'm calling from the planet Perdide
Northern hemisphere, 73rd sector
16:50, universal time
Jaffar, the hornets
attacked us by surprise!
It was horrible
Annie is dead
I'm heading for the Dolongs
Jaffar, I've crashed
I'm trapped. I'm sending Piel
to the Dolongs with a microphone
Come get him, for God's sake!
Hurry!
I beg you!
Goodbye Jaffar...
and thank you
Piel! Can you hear me?
Answer, if you hear me
Can you hear me, Piel?
Answer me!
I don't like you, and I don't like your lights
Mike!
I don't like you either
What?
I didn't know you could hear me, Mike
Piel, is that you?
Of course it's me
Where are you?
Right here, in front of you
Piel, I'm speaking to you
from very far away
Look, Jaffar, he can't understand
- Perhaps you should...
- Why do you have two voices?
Answer, Mike.
I know your name is Mike
Why do you have two voices?
You're right, Piel.
My name is Mike
And I have two voices because I have practically nothing else
I don't have eyes to see with, nor legs to walk with...
...nor arms to hold things with
So instead, I have two voices...
...and I can even have more than that
- Do you understand?
- I think so
- You're in a forest now, aren't you?
- Yes
- With glowing red and yellow fruit?
- Yes, that's right
Good. Just wait there.
A big spaceship will come to get you
Wait a minute!
We're not going to Aldebaran anymore?
That's exactly it!
But we're paying you a fortune to take us to Aldebaran
You can't break your word
I didn't promise anything,
Prince Matton
Aldebaran was on my way and you asked to join the ship...
...with half the public treasury that you pocketed
- Only that which was mine
- Don't make me laugh!
The police of the Interplanetary
Reformed Alliance are on your tail
Your destination makes no difference to you
It could be Aldebaran, or anywhere else, just as long as you get away
Yes, I've changed our destination
It's no longer Aldebaran.
It's Perdide
Consider yourself lucky that you're going anywhere and I've taken pity on you
And don't smoke on board!
Oxygen is precious
Go back to your cabin and buckle up
To get to Perdide, we'll have to land on Devil's Ball...
...and then go to Gamma 10
We'll have to wait for the passage of the Blue Comet
By keeping within its magnetic field, we'll be able to approach Perdide
Mike, why are you so quiet?
Piel, I'm busy right now
I'll talk to you later
Oh, they're lovely
Silbad calls them his shrews
Jaffar, you rascal!
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
Perdide would be nice, if it weren't for the hornets
You know about the hornets of Perdide, Princess?
Here. Look at this
The hornets of Perdide did this to me years ago
They like to eat the human brain...
...just as if it were a soft-boiled egg
Mr Silbad, please...
Sorry, Prince
So what were you saying about your friend Claude?
- Claude had a son called Piel
- A son!
Having a wife is bad enough, but a son as well...
- Jaffar, your friend is crazy!
- He's dead
Those hornets again
His wife too, and the boy?
The boy's taken refuge in the Dolongs
As long as he stays there, he's safe
The pollen from the trees keeps off the hornets
Are there settlers around?
Piel is totally alone on Perdide
How old is he?
He must be somewhere between five and ten Earth years
The only link you have with him is through that mike?
A little marvel, that thing!
Instant communication anywhere in Space Four
Yes, Claude gave it to me
He thought I might need help one day.
But he was the one who needed it
Let me think
They've been singing for three days.
They'll soon metamorphose
- It could work
- What could, Mr Silbad?
If someone who knows Perdide very well...
...remains in contact with the boy...
...and keeps telling him what to do...
...he'll make it, he'll manage to get out
How long will it take you to get there?
Hello, Piel. Are you there?
How would you like to hear a song?
Listen to this!
It's the song of the Lamprey Guzzlers.
Do you know that one?
No, sing it to me, Mike
I'm a galactic lush
The kind that will buy you a drink
I'm a cosmic tramp
and I roam without a blush
I'm the Astro Guzzler
But believe me when I say
Sometimes I feel very depressed,
and I end up in the gutter
I'm a nasty piece of work
Sometimes it's true I go berserk
A really long time ago
How long exactly, who knows?
I was having a ball on the Lamprey
with all the friends I know
Suddenly I realised
I might have drunk too much
But the hell with it,
you only have one life
One drink after another
Like a famous Guzzler
Alcohol is flowing
and that's what matters
I'm the interstellar fool
Space is so beautiful
Let's have another drink
and then we'll...
You ought to be ashamed of yourself...
...singing this kind of song to a child
Why did you stop, Mike?
Keep singing
I'll sing the rest later on
Right now, little one, I want you to eat one of those pretty red fruits
I'm tired of them.
Isn't there anything else?
Do you want me to get angry?
OK, OK...
What's a lamprey?
Ah, my boy,
that was a proud space vessel...
... the last of an illustrious fleet
What's a guzzler?
Well, now, that's, er...
Guzzle... that means sort of to drink
So guzzlers are people
who like to drink just a tiny little bit
You know, Mike,
I'd like to drink something as well
- I'm thirsty
- I've already told you
You can drink the juice
of the red fruit
I don't like that taste
I'd like some water
Listen
I know something that's much better than water
Are there giant strawberries near where you are?
Enormous juicy strawberries?
I can't see any
Look around a little
They grow on the trunks of trees.
There must be some around
There's one, over there
Right. I'm standing in front of your big, fat strawberry
- What shall I do now?
- You see those soft, round spots on it?
- Yes
- Burst them open with your finger
Something will flow out
that's much better than water
That's good!
Are you crazy, Silbad?
First you sing him drinking songs and now you're trying to get him drunk
Under the circumstances, my friend, we can't be choosy
The juice of the legol contains an alkaloid
It's harmless but it will help him sleep...
...and keep him out of trouble
Are you sure it won't poison him?
If he soaks it up for a month straight, then maybe yes, it could be harmful
But he'll get over it very quickly.
Believe me. I know from experience
He'll be OK
I really like your friend
Yeah, he's quite a character, isn't he?
He certainly is
Maybe I'm just imagining things
Not completely, Belle
The fact is, Silbad does suffer
- In his head?
- No, in his heart
Silbad has been hopelessly in love for 20 years
- In love? With whom?
- With this planet
You're going to witness something very rare
Close your minds!
We're here!
- What's that?
- The metamorphosis of the shrews
But be careful.
Those little scamps are telepathic
Close your minds!
We're here!
Careful, close your minds!
Leave us in peace.
Go on, be off with you
Close your mind, human.
I hear everything
Look! Two of them seem to be stuck
Yes. And the petals are closing again
Stay here. I'll go
Hello, Piel?
Little Piel, do you hear me?
Would you go and fetch the prince, please?
To enter the Blue Comet's magnetic field, we have to leave in an hour
I bet you'd be more than happy to abandon the prince here
- Certainly not!
- You and your code of honour
Hello. Who are you?
Come on, now
Don't be afraid of me
Am I afraid of you?
Of course not
Isn't it you who took my Mike?
Listen, you old pirate, are you sure everything's OK?
We haven't heard from the boy in a while
That's true. He should have been awake for some time now
Ssh! I can hear something
It's as if he were a long way from the mike
Answer me!
Well, I can't shout any louder
We have to make a sound that will catch his attention
Do you know the war cry of the fighting monks of Guamar 35?
Then cover your ears
No comments, please
Just wait
Mike, was it you who shouted like that?
Are you all right?
It sounded like you were very far away from me
There was a big animal sitting on you
- I'm glad I found you again
- Me too, little one
What happened?
I heard a terrifying noise
It was nothing, my dear lady
I was just clearing my throat
I drew it from memory
Here's the Desert of the Sangs
The Dolongs are here
Claude arrived from the west in his machine
So, the little fellow had to cross through here
Right... Now there are only a few caves there
Piel must have used a cave for shelter
My dear lady, the caves of Perdide are full of Sarpeels
- Full of what?
- Sarpeels
Another scourge on Perdide
They're very dangerous creepers
Oh, how awful!
- Do you think Piel is...
- No. I've questioned him
He hasn't got near the caves
I'm worried about the lake
The lake?
What's the danger there?
It's just a body of water per se, filled with friendly little fish
However, a kid can drown, and the hornets can get nearby
By now, Piel must be very close to it
There's something odd going on behind that screen
Something that doesn't...
Hey! Stowaways!
The others preferred to remain on Devil's Ball
To await the next transformation
Something stinks here
Mind your language in front of a lady!
Oh, dear. Perhaps it's my perfume
No, madam, not on your life.
Your perfume is exquisite
You must excuse Yula.
He's talking through his hat
- A bad telepathic smell?
- That's it!
There's a thought here that stinks, don't you think, Jad?
Now, enough of that.
I'm ashamed of you
Don't you know how to behave in polite company?
Anyway, it's gone now
Piel, are you there?
Yes, I'm here... and I'm getting fed up with being here too
Yes, I understand, dear Piel
So for a change,
why don't we take a little walk?
I don't want to take a walk.
I want to be somewhere else
Of course, but to be somewhere else,
you have to walk
I want you to go to the lake
You'll be able to get washed there
Why? I'm not dirty
All right, you don't have to wash
But the lake's pretty.
You'll enjoy it
Well, if I don't have to wash, OK then
How do I get there?
First, you have to turn your back
to the moon
Why have you changed your voice again?
I liked the other ones better
The others have to rest
How much farther is the lake?
You'll be there in just a few minutes
I'm going to see what the prince is up to
Here you are.
I was wondering where you'd gone
Well, I just wanted to be useful
Since no one was looking after Piel,
I thought I would
Any new developments?
No. He's asleep
Look! Like this, it's more beautiful
Why own sparkling things, if all you do is lock them in a bin like rubbish?
You know how it is
Human beings, at least some of them, don't care about the beauty of things
Only their value interests them
"Value"?
What's "value"?
It's a concept.
I read it in their thoughts
And what's a concept?
To tell you the truth, I'm not too sure
It's something that drives men crazy...
...at least some of them, like Prince Matton
Now there I agree with you
His thoughts smell terrible
Perhaps we should warn the others
They're humans, space mate.
We are gnomes
It's best that we each mind our own business
"Business"? What's "business"?
Humans have their way of doing things...
...and we have our own
I suppose you're right, but Prince Matton's thoughts still stink
Right. From this point on, we can rely on the computer
It'll put us in orbit around Gamma 10...
...until the Blue Comet passes
Then it'll send us into its gravitational field
Since we'll be orbiting Gamma 10...
...would we have enough time to land there?
We could if we wanted to
All right, I'll relieve you now
But I prefer to stay here and look after the kid
You see, Jaffar...
...when I said a little while ago that I wanted to be useful...
...I truly meant it
The thoughts of that human keep smelling worse and worse
Well, close your mind, space mate
Those are human affairs, not ours
- Piel?
- Well, it's about time!
What happened to you?
Did you fall asleep?
Never mind.
Just tell me, are you still walking?
Don't forget, you have to reach the lake
But I'm already there
Are you!
- And what have you been doing?
- I saw a big fish
Is that all?
Did you get washed?
You said I didn't have to
I've changed my mind.
You have to take a bath
Go into the water and head towards the middle of the lake
But I'll drown!
Of course you won't, you little fool
If you carry me with you,
you'll be safe
I'll make you float on the water.
You'll see
Are you in the lake yet?
Yes, but it's cold
Walk to the middle of the lake
Keep walking. Forward!
Obey me!
I am walking,
but this is getting deep
- No, Piel! Stop!
- Belle!
- Don't move
- You wouldn't dare...
Mike! What did you say?
What do you want me to do now?
I'm cold,
and I'm almost out of my depth
Piel, turn around and get out of the water!
Get out of this lake at once!
Belle, listen. I can explain
It's perfectly clear
But if we continue to Perdide, we're finished
They'll take my treasure
We'll be miserable tramps, roaming from planet to planet
Jaffar, please come here immediately
Right. I'm coming
Go to the Dolongs, dry yourself, and wait there until I speak to you again
I have to think for a moment
Belle, have pity on me.
Try to understand
Tell Jaffar I tried to kill the child, and he'll throw me out into space
Belle, please, I beg you!
- What's going on?
- Mike!
I did what you told me to do
I've come out of the lake,
and I'm drying myself
Now what should I do?
- Just wait there
- I see
- May I make a suggestion?
- Go ahead
Oh, no!
There go all our decorations
All that work for nothing
I'm beginning to think that the human race is crazy!
Let me out! I'll kill you!
I swear, I'll kill you!
What a nightmare!
We've got to do something
I can't take any more of that guy's thoughts
I'll simply die if he carries on like this
He's giving me a splitting headache too
Look.
He wants to get out of here, right?
Perhaps we could...
Don't talk nonsense
That guy is a cosmic danger
Jad, I'm getting sick
Let's help him escape
All he wants is to take the shuttle to go to Gamma 10
That's not all.
He also wants to recover his treasure...
...to recruit mercenaries and massacre everybody
No. We can't let him get away
- He'll never come back from Gamma 10
- How do you know?
Can't you hear that planet?
Hear it? It's bursting my eardrums
Mine too, space mate
That's a world I don't want to have anything to do with
- He'll never leave it
- No. Not a chance
Well, then, shall we liberate that monster?
Look out
Little white boy
Look out
For your gloomy thoughts
Look out
My little Astro
Look out
For the black holes
Look out
Little white boy
Look out
For certain looks
Everything's fine now, Mike
I'm warm and I'm sleepy...
... and I like it
when you sing like my mum
Go to sleep now, Piel
I love you, Mike
And I love you too, little Piel
What's going on?
Someone's ejected in the shuttle!
- It's the prince!
- Prepare the emergency capsule
What kind of planet is this?
What happened?
I don't know, space mate...
...but a little more of it and I think my brain would have melted
I thought mine was turning to stone
We have to do something
First of all, let's not lose Jaffar
Jad, I'm afraid
I'm afraid of what's under that dome
Me too, space mate.
I'm terrified
We're the ones who got Jaffar into this mess
Now we'll have to get him out of it
We must contact the others in the spaceship
We can try
That thing is liable to swallow our brains
My dear lady, there's nothing we can do but wait...
...and hope Jaffar will make it back before the passage of the Blue Comet...
...which means he only has five hours
At last! Where were you?
Do you think it's easy for us, with that thinking thing?
It's no use. It's too sturdy
But take off my helmet.
The air is breathable here
Listen. You're going to have to pilot the shuttle
Tune in on my thoughts, and I'll show you how to fly it
Take it back up to the spaceship
Tell Silbad to catch the Blue Comet, and go and save the boy
And desert you?
Out of the question
I think it's a pretty good idea
Why don't we get out of here?
We can always return later to save Jaffar
Of course. Yula is right
No. Yula is wrong, and he knows it
Yula, I'm ashamed of you
You're a coward, a scaredy-cat, a cry-baby and a milksop
And what's more, you're spineless, chicken-hearted
You know what will happen to Jaffar in just a few hours, if we leave him here
I can take care of myself
Not against that, Jaffar.
Not against that thing
- What thing?
- It doesn't have a name
It's... It's pure thought
Don't worry.
I can handle pure thought
I'm afraid you can't
The thought will absorb you as it has all the others
- What others?
- Those who set foot on Gamma 10
They look perfectly normal
Now they're puppets... puppets of that thing
Brothers!
It is time!
Once again, difference has intruded on Gamma 10
Once again, the ceremony must take place
Once again, difference must be abolished...
...and unity restored
Here they come!
I smell their thoughts
Relax. We still have a minute
Pull, Jaffar!
They're coming!
They're coming!
Jad, is there anything I can do?
Against the thing, your thought is powerless...
...a feather against a mountain
- That is, unless...
- Unless what?
Unless you can turn your thought against itself and any other thought
If you can become pure denial, pure hate, pure insane fury...
Then there's a slim chance that you can annihilate the thing
But you will annihilate yourself at the same time
- I prefer to be destroyed than enslaved
- They're here!
Hurry to the shuttle, and do exactly as I told you
Obey!
- Goodbye, Jaffar
- Hurry!
Jaffar, do you think
I'm a coward and a cry-baby...
...and all those things
Jad called me?
Of course not.
You're a sweet little gnome, Yula
And you've very brave.
Now goodbye
Thank you, Jaffar
Here is the second individual
Let's carry him to the bliss of the sameness
Happiness
Happiness upon them!
Happiness upon us!
Happiness!
Unity!
Are they going to turn us into fodder for that blob?
It's more complicated than that...
...but that's the general idea
I suggest that we fight and die together
That won't do any good
Don't you understand?
I say we fight them
We can wipe out a few dozen before they crush us
The enemy is there, Matt
All those poor creatures are nothing but puppets
Then let's attack the blob
- There must be something we can do!
- Yes, there is one thing
When we're absorbed into it...
...when it tries to turn us into contented puppets...
...we must hate and deny ourselves with all the force in our minds
We must become madmen in order to drive it mad
But even if we succeed...
...it will cost us our lives and our souls
That suits me fine
My life isn't worth much, and my soul is worth nothing
The ceremony has begun!
In a few moments...
...the unhappy ones...
...will lose their individuality
They will be one with us
We will be one with them!
All will be unified!
Say, space mate.
Your thoughts have an odd smell
Your intention is a funny colour
That's because I don't appreciate you calling me a coward
Come on. We have very little time before the Blue Comet passes
Right. Hold tight!
Let's go, Matt!
Goodbye!
No, Jaffar, I'll go!
If you ever get out of this, take care of Belle
Monstrous violation!
Difference is opposing unity!
One individual is hurling himself into totality!
The ceremony... is disrupted!
The individual denies it with all his strength!
He denies totality!
Difference denies unity!
Hatred denies happiness!
Folly denies peace!
Jad, Yula!
By the rings of Saturn!
What are they doing down there?
I swear, they've started an interplanetary war
Why are you so quiet, Mike?
Are you worried?
No, everything is all right, Piel
Look, Belle! He did it!
He's returning!
Prepare for departure
- Jaffar, do you read me?
- Roger
May I be bamboozled by the mighty stars!
What in the devil's name is all that?
Sorry. I was a little too busy to warn you
We have guests for dinner
You're a funny Wah-wah, aren't you?
Have you lost your pals?
Let's go and look for them together
Are you quite sure he's gentle?
Oh, yes, Mike.
He's a good friend
Piel's walking with a thing that goes, "wah-wah"
There's nothing to fear.
It's just a hippornithorhynchus
Gentle as a lamb and strictly vegetarian
How are you feeling, Yula?
You know very well
Poor thing!
When they're asleep, their thoughts smell the strongest
I don't understand why humans stuff themselves with food and drink...
...as soon as they meet
Not only humans
Did you see how much that Centaurian packed away last night?
I can understand, but...
I beg your pardon?
Excuse me.
I'm tuned into...
...the thoughts of that moustached man...
...who drank three quarts of moonshine last night
He can't prevent...
...his glottis from convulsing and neither can I
Try to close your mind
I can't.
I have the hangovers of...
...32 people, all at the...
...same time
- Is everything all right?
- Yes
Belle, I haven't yet told you how Matton died
Don't bother. I'm sure he died as I wish he would have lived...
...with generosity and courage
Silbad?
- Trouble?
- Yes
We are being pursued
by a warship of the Reform
Great! Let's attack them!
Easier said than done.
Right, everyone
Meeting in the conference room
at once
This is the space cruiser Silver Vessel, of the Reform Patrol Fleet
Unidentified ship, maintain your speed
We are going to board you
This is spaceship Double Triangle 22, receiving you
We await your visit with humble respect
Captain Jaffar
If you hadn't saved my life...
...I'd cut your throat for your cowardice
Do you want to surrender to them?
I want them to board us
You and your comrades need your own ship, right?
Well, you can get theirs, but only by letting them board ours first
The captain's right.
We're stalking big game
We must proceed with caution
If you have any ideas...
I believe I have one
Allow me to present my good friend,
Onyx the Digeed of Gnaz
What's he supposed to do, make them die laughing?
Quiet!
My friend has the natural ability to mimic anything
Go ahead, Onyx, give us a little demonstration
Amazing!
It even has the smell
Onyx fully controls his molecular structure...
...and can change it in an infinite number of ways
Hey, Onyx...
...change yourself into a secret weapon
Something dreadful!
By the rings of Saturn!
It's amazing what they can do nowadays
As you can see, the illusion is perfect
I must admit, that opens up a lot of possibilities
What do you think, Silbad?
I think the Reformists are in for a bad time
A ship full of foul-smelling thoughts is approaching
Attention, everyone
As soon as the airlock is sealed, keep your mouths shut
Jad and Yula, if anything goes wrong...
...warn me by telepathy
Honourable representatives of the Reform...
...I welcome you on board my humble ship
Your ship is giving refuge to Matton, the traitor, former prince of Atral
And the treasure chest that was stolen by the traitor
Silence
Actually, it was while defending this mysterious chest that Matt...
...that the prince was murdered by the pirates of Gamma 10
Matton is dead?
And where's the chest now?
In the hold, with the pirates we took prisoner
Let's go and see that treasure chest
- Halt! Leave that here
- But it's not a weapon
Do as you're told!
Me and Wah-wah found a cave
We'll be safe here until his friends come
Go on, Wah-wah.
Go on in
Don't leave me alone.
Do something!
What a bunch!
Our prisoners... the pirates of Gamma 10
May I suggest that Your Excellencies have these creatures re-educated?
Perhaps. We'll see
Everything's fine, Jaffar
They don't see the trap
They don't see anything.
They're all blind
Captain, that was a good catch
Guards, prepare for immediate transhipment
Silbad, how long do you think it will take them to become masters of the vessel?
With the Digeed, their secret weapon, two hours...
They might prefer to stretch out the pleasure
The microphone is no longer working
- Answer me, little one!
- We've lost him!
I'm afraid we'll never hear from him again!
Come on, Belle.
Don't worry
Silbad will fix it
There's nothing to fix. The problem is, there's no one at the other end
No offence, but you're not very pretty
In fact, you're ugly... all of you
Go away!
Do you hear me?
Go away!
Clear off!
I've given her a sedative
She's convinced it's her fault
Nonsense. Something must have happened on Perdide
Fortunately, we're getting nearer
Soon the computer will release us from the Blue Comet's gravitational field
Hello, Piel?
Can you hear me?
The stars, they're fading out in the sector of Perdide
What is that?
A magnetic storm?
I don't know
But all the dials are going crazy!
Or maybe we are...
What's going on?
According to these instruments...
...all the radiations in the sector, including light...
...are going backwards!
Buckle up, quick!
Attention
This is Patrol Robot number five...
... of the fleet of the Federation
of the Time Masters
This is a warning
You are approaching
the forbidden zone of Perdide
Identify yourselves
and decelerate to a stop
I repeat
You are entering a forbidden zone
Identify yourselves and stop
Calling adviser Pixa
An unidentified vessel
is entering the forbidden zone
Its course is irregular
Shall we destroy it?
No. I want a thorough investigation
Board the vessel
and escort it to the base
Captain Jaffar and his crew should consider themselves lucky
We managed to save those odd creatures
Good. They're very valuable from a scientific point of view
- Silbad as well?
- Yes
But in truth, the old man is dying
It's just a question of hours
You and your ship were at the fringe of the danger area...
...when the operation took place
- What operation?
- Do you know where we are?
Well, I can see we're in a hospital somewhere in space
Not just somewhere in space, Princess
We are in a particular zone now being colonised by the Time Masters
Have you ever heard of their method of accelerated colonisation?
No, never
It's a strange race, Princess
They can manipulate time itself
When they decide to colonise a planet, they project it into the past...
...literally send it backwards through time
In the case of Perdide,
60 years backwards
So for those on a distant ship...
...it would seem as if light rays were speeding in reverse...
...and all of space were going mad
Exactly. But to those on the planet being colonised...
...everything seems normal...
...except that their present time would be that of 60 years ago
And that's what happened to Perdide
My God, Piel!
Mike...
Jaffar, how old is Silbad?
No one knows
No one's ever known anything about his childhood
Keep quiet
The old man's past is rising from the depths
- Shut your eyes, humans
- And open your minds
For what was hidden in the folds of time can now be revealed
Now long-lost memories...
...the unknown past of a small child...
...will be projected on your mental screens
Shut your eyes, humans, and open your minds
Mike! Mike!
- It's Piel's voice!
- Silence, humans
It's Piel...
...just as he was when we were approaching Perdide
No, Belle.
It's Piel as he was 60 years ago
It's Piel hurled into the past, along with the entire planet...
...by the Time Masters
Lowry! Cover me!
Get away from him, filthy creatures!
I hope those filthy beasts didn't hurt you too much, son
I've done everything I could
The doctors on my planet will do the rest
And now the best thing you can do is sleep
Where are we now, Lowry?
What sector is it?
Those monsters!
Speak up, Lowry!
Didn't you hear me?
I'm sorry. I was thinking
You're getting old, Lowry
Alas, Igor, aren't we all?
I'll have none of your insolence!
Now, then, be good enough to explain to me...
...why we suddenly found ourselves on the surface of a planet...
...when just a moment before we were in empty space?
- Were you daydreaming?
- I had nothing to do with it, Igor
It was the planet's fault
- What planet?
- The planet Perdide
It suddenly appeared before us
Come now, don't be silly!
- Where did it come from?
- From the future
Lowry!
I think you're becoming senile
I am not becoming senile!
The planet Perdide surged out of
the future and almost smashed into us
But the child, Lowry, the child...
Did he also "surge out of the future", as you say?
Exactly, Igor, with the planet
It's stopped
I know what happened.
The child recovered
He became a cabin boy, then a space sailor...
...a pilot, a mercenary...
...a hundred other things that filled 60 years of his life
The orphan of Perdide is dead, humans
He has left our time to enter into eternity
It's strange
There are only a dozen, but I sense the emotions of a thousand
I know. Me too
Where is it all coming from?
From the heart...
From the heart, Yula
I believe we loved that old man very, very much
Look up there!
A Time Master
[wolf howling]
[thunderclaps]
Randolph... I wish you wouldn't rush me this way.
- I thought it proper...
- Give me your arm.
- Your arm, not your hand.
- Sorry, my love.
Here we are...
Easy does it.
Upsy-daisy!
Very good.
Just a moment...
Beastly night.
I do hope the Bradfords don't serve mutton again this evening.
Hay...
-...I do hope...
- I heard you, Randolph.
Hello! I seem to have forgotten my smokes.
Really, Randolph!
Your choice of words!
Wrong again?
Again.
Still... why don't you try to do one thing in your lifetime right?
It could be quite a challenge.
Yes... quite.
Well, I'll... just pop back into the manor and fetch some smokes. Ah... cigars.
Don't go away, buttercup!
Buttercup!
[thunderclaps]
Here we are, my dear!
Frightfully sorry for the delay.
All is well that ends satisfactorily.
Oh, blast!
Eh...
Perhaps you're right.
Maybe I will try to organize something right in my life.
Find a project, so to speak.
Good idea, lamb-pie.
I say, Victoria, no fair dozing before dinner.
You had to bring so many pigeons?
We might have to send a lot of messages back to the Yard.
- Find a cleaner way to send a message.
- I'm working on it.
- Did you bring the time-gun?
- Yeah, I've got it.
This isn't one of your better inventions.
Whoever heard of a gun that went off every hour.
Might save your life someday.
If you have to shoot someone every hour.
By the way, better turn it off, it's almost 3 o'clock.
Too late. Just...
You know, you're gonna be the death of me yet.
Did you see the look on the chief's face when we got called in... to solve the Morley case?
Yes, sir! When they talk about the detective world, first names that are gonna roll off people's lips are...
Inspector Winship and Dr. Tart.
Since I shot the chief in the foot with your stupid time-gun, we're lucky he didn't have us walking a beat!
- Hello, gents. What'll it be?
- Fill her up.
Right!
Would you believe the price of gas?
It's almost 10 ¢ a gallon.
Cor, blimey!
You know who you are?
You're the two idiots... what got your picture in the newspaper! Inspector...
-...Winship and Dr. Tart!
- All right. That's us.
- Here, have a cigar.
- Oh...
- Hey, it's the Dorfderflankter.
- Oh, thanks!
I'll bet you two... private eyes have been called in on this Morley case, eh?
Exactly. Official business.
Well... folks around these pans don't believe it were no accident.
Lord Morley, he knew his cars.
And he was a good driver.
Why, he was a licensed driver!
Say...
You two gents could make my place famous!
Wait here while I get pencil and paper and I'll get your autographs!
I'll bet a lot of people saw our picture in the paper.
- How's that cigar?
- [Coughing].
- The Duke of Norton smokes those.
- Yeah, they're mild.
Think I'll find out if we're on the right road.
[coughing heavily]
Excuse me. Our destination is the Morley Manor.
Are we heading in the right direction?
The Morley Manor?
- The man's stone deaf.
- Really?
Hey!
You may be right there, huh?
All right...
Pardon me.
Could you help us out?!
You're probably right on it.
Could you...
Probably blind, too. I think he read lips, so I'll just...
Can you tell us where the Morley Manor is?
The Morley Manor?
We're looking for the...
We'll find it ourselves, I guess.
I know, I have to work with him.
- There you go. Keep the change.
- 'Ere you go, governor.
Er...
Phiew! I can't wait to hang this in a window.
And everybody who sees it they'll know you Yanks were really here!
Thank you, sir.
Ah, this is great!
This is something we'll keep in a place that will always be special to us.
Thank you, governor.
Hay...
Do you know you... you got stuff all over your face?
- Huh?
- You got stuff all over your face.
He's oiling his brain.
Let's get going. These pigeons are beginning to stink!
- Bye!
- Bye.
And there they go, Roy... two idiots what's gonna leave their mark wherever they go!
We really need to get that muffler fixed.
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy... boy, look at that house.
Boy, that's bigger than the home town I grew up in.
Don't remind me. If it hadn't been for your harebrained inventions, we wouldn't have had to leave the States.
Better get a pigeon in case we have to contact the Yard.
I'm gonna take Judy. Harold's been under the weather lately.
- His stool's been a little loose.
- That's too bad.
I'll have to put a Get Well card on the bottom of his cage.
Now get the door.
Ooooh!
Gee...
Yes?
Good day. lam Inspector Winship, and this is my assistant,
Dr. Tart.
We're the law and the order.
We've been assigned to this case by the Yard.
I just thought of something.
We're actually working by the yard.
We received this letter.
We're here to... investigate the Morley case.
The Morleys' death was an accident.
You are mistaken, gentlemen.
Perhaps we should make that decision.
The letter stated that it was definitely murder.
[snars agitatedly]
It's not murder!
[yelling uncontrollably]
Justin!
Ahh... ahh... ohh...
These... two gentlemen... are here to investigate the death of Lord and Lady Morley.
We're here to investigate the murder!
[excited muttering]
Huh?
This letter is signed, Lord Morley.
That's...
That's right.
Lord Morley was dead at the time this letter was written.
How'd he do that?
In order to find out, perhaps we should get a warrant from the Yard.
That won't be necessary.
- Shall I take them to Mistress Phyllis?
- Yeah.
Show them to the study.
Justin!
May I speak to you for a moment in private?
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Do me a favor. Don't say that word around this guy.
- What word?
- Murder!
You won't believe what this guy goes through.
What you're talking about?
Oh! Mm...
Walk this way.
Mistress Phyllis!
Must you sneak up on me, you decayed old sissy?!
These two gentlemen are here to see you.
This is Inspector Winship, and this is Dr. Tart.
They were in the yard.
From the Yard.
Inspector...
Yes, we're here to investigate the Morley murder.
Shhh...
Oh... gentlemen forgot their letter...
Oh, ha-ha-ha!
Ouch!
I'm sorry. I'm a little on edge lately.
Well, you can relax now that we're here.
My God, what was that?!
Ah, th-that was a time-gun.
It goes off every hour.
- You forgot to shut it off again.
- M-hm.
Gentlemen...
Won't you take a seat.
All right, we'll need to know some facts, so why don't you start from the beginning?
- Tart? Notes...
- Right.
I was adopted by the Morleys when I was 10.
Lady Morley never had children.
Lord Morley never could do anything right.
I was shipped off to boarding school when I was 13, and I only got to see them in the summers.
Now... they're gone.
Oh, we're so sorry.
Sorry.
I am the sole heir to the Morley fortune.
But there was a stipulation in the will that if I die, the jack-pot... fortune... is to be divided equally among the living members of the staff.
I suspect that they would like to see me... dead!
Well...
I don't mean to accuse, but we will have to know where you were during the incident.
I was in Parkhurst Restaurant.
- I was in that little booth...
- Not you, blockhead. Her!
Please...
Certainly.
- Wanna get this down?
- Right.
I was in my bedroom... preparing to retire for the evening.
I remember distinctly, because...
I had just purchased a new nightgown from Talbot's and I was trying it on.
It was a light blue silk gown...
Low cut here in front... with thin lacey straps, which crossed... here...
The sides were split open... about up to... here.
And I remember thinking to myself how delicate the gown was.
I was looking at myself... in a full length mirror, and I noticed... with the light behind me... that I could see through the gown.
And that's where I was.
Did you get that?
Huh?
- What she said.
- Huh?
Oh, er...
No, I-I-I forgot to take legs... notes...
Well, what else can you tell us about the deaths?
Oh, just that they were on their way out to dine.
Lord Morley evidently had a heart attack.
He probably had his foot on the accelerator... causing the car to speed up across the lawn and... down into the lagoon.
They both drowned!
It was awful!
- Oh, we're sorry, Miss Phyllis.
- Yeah, but remember, a lot of... people die.
The reason... we're here, Miss Phyllis... is in this letter.
It requests that we investigate the Morley murder.
And is signed, Lord Morley.
It would've been impossible for
Lord Morley to have written that letter after his death.
Unless he was a ghost.
Huh? A ghost?
Er... who else was here the night of the...
"accident"?
Oh, just the staff.
Well, I suppose we'll have the question the...
"staff".
But first we'd like to inspect
Lord Morley's quarters.
Oh, yes... of course.
Follow me, please.
Got that message?
Better send it off to the Yard, let them know we're here.
Want to write another message?
No.
- How many rooms are in this place?
Small, but we call it home.
That's Lord Morley's room.
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy...
- What a place, huh?
- Yeah.
Well, one thing is obvious...
- What's that?
- Lord Morley was right handed.
- How do you know that?
- Simple.
Look at the placement of the things on his desk.
Pen... magnifying glass... stationery box...
Everything to the right of center.
Indicating that the ma--...
The... ring around your collar...
Wait a minute. What's this?
A Paper!
Another brilliant deduction.
Hey, there's those two idiots again.
You know, I've got an idea.
Whoever wrote that letter must've read about us in the newspaper!
What is it?
What's what?
- The idea you got.
- I just told you!
What was it?
Whoever wrote that letter must've read about us in the newspaper!
Right!
That letter was signed by Lord Morley.
So he must've read about us and called us in to solve his murder!
How could Lord Morley write us after he was dead?
Right!
You know what?
Maybe whoever killed Lord Morley wrote that letter.
If you killed Lord Morley, would you ask someone to find the killer?
Are you saying,
I killed Lord Morley?
No, I'm saying you're killing me!
Hey, cigars...
Hm...
I don't think they'd miss one cigar. Huh?
- What did you do?!
- I didn't do it!
- Light a candle.
- I haven't got a candle.
[astonished sigh]
- You said you didn't have a candle.
- I know I...
- Well, light it.
- How do I...
- Good! Let's get out of here.
- Oh! I...
Ah... listen...
- Can I talk to you about this candle?
- What's to talk about?
- Ever seen a candle before?
- Not one that came out of the woodwork.
Shut up!
Let's get in step, all right?
Left foot first.
Would you get in front!
Look at that.
Hey... it's Santa!
No wonder he didn't come around last year.
Is there anything you don't believe in?
Long way down there.
Clear that thing out of there.
Let's get up that ladder.
Here, hold that.
Hey, look! There's presents...
- in this thing.
- You're kidding.
- Hm, is it a drum?
- Harmonica.
- Let me see that.
- Me first.
Hang on. We must be near a bowling alley.
Aaaah!
Wow! Oh!
Oh... my back.
They ought to get the elevator fixed!
Oh!
Ah...
Oh, there you are.
Staff, stand to attention!
I would like to introduce
Inspector Winship and Dr. Tart.
- They were in the yard.
- From the Yard.
Yes. The inspector would like to say a few words.
Thank you.
- After some early investigation...
- Right.
And the letter to indicate so...
Dr. Tart and I have come to the conclusion...
- that we have among us...
- Oh, boy.
A murderer!
And that killer is right here in this room!
. My bosom!
- My loin!
All right, get your hands off...
All right.
I want each one of you...
What?
I want each one of you to state your name... and how you came to work for the Morleys.
Who wants to go first?
I'll get it.
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe...
Catch a killer by the t--...
- Let me handle this, please.
- Oh.
All right, we'll start with you.
I am honorable Mr. Uwatsum.
I've been employed for ten years.
Lady Morley won me in bridge game.
I always liked her... just like a mama-san.
Is that the truth?
Fa! Fe!
Fo!
Seems like a nice guy.
And you...
- my dear?
- I'm Hilda, the upstairs maid.
Lord Morley gave me a promotion every week. He said I was the only maid he'd ever had who was full of bounce.
- What am I gonna do now?
- Er... excuse me.
My card...
Oh! Ta...
We can use somebody to do a little light work around the house.
Like laundry or something...
Ahem... and you, sir?
I am Tibet, the caretaker.
Burp!
I've been here ever since
Lord Morley saved my life... when I was caught in that... animal trap.
My Gypsy custom compelled me to be indebted to them.
Unfortunately... they died.
Gypsy, huh?
You know how to get rid of warts?
Probably a rumor.
- What do you have to say?
- My name... is Jock. I'm the groom.
I was under Lord Morley's command in India.
He had my tongue cut out...
Er... ahem... what did you say?
He said... [mumbling]
- Will you shut up?
- That's what he said.
Jock is the groom.
He served under Lord Morley's command in India.
He disliked Lady Morley immensely.
For she used to make him sing for his supper.
His tongue was cut out when he was caught trying to steal... a ruby from his commanding sergeant's wife.
Terribly rough penalty for just trying to steal a ruby, isn't it?
It was in her navel... at the time.
Thank you.
I am Justin, the butler.
I was accused of killing my wife and her lovers.
But Lord Morley... bless him... convinced the authorities it was a case of justifiable insanity... and I've served him... happily... ever since.
How many lovers did your wife... have?
Thirteen.
Er...
- Er... do you mind if I have a...
- Well, if you wish.
Thank you. Cheers.
Ah...
And you?
I have been here forever.
My first duty was to
Lady and Lord Morley.
Then Phyllis came... and everything changed.
It's a shame that accidents always happen to the wrong people.
Hm...
What is this stuff?
I believe it's ink.
Ink?!
Yes. Lord Morley brought it back from India.
It's made of buzzard pus.
All right, thank you.
Well, I... everybody is dismissed, but stay on the premises.
Out!
I want to... er...
I'd like to inspect the car the Morleys were killed in.
I'll show you the way.
Huh?
[wolf howling]
Now... Miss Phyllis told us... that Lord Morley went back to the manor to get a cigar case.
While Lady Morley was awaiting his return... someone in the back seat took this scarf and strangled her.
Now...
Ah-h!
- Like this?
- Ah!
Stop it!
- Well I was, er...
- You dummy!
Well...
When Lord Morley returned and sat in the driver's seat... he was struck from behind with this pipe.
After he was knocked unconscious, the killer started the car, turned on the lights, put it into gear... and drove the car into the lagoon while standing on the running board.
Ah-h...
Now let's see...
Stan the car... put in gear...
Here we go.
It's good how you figured this out.
Ah-ouch!
Hey!
You missed the lagoon!
You know... those two idiots have got me worried.
They will question the staff.
When they do, make sure they find out only what we wish them to find out.
Oh, right, it's me. Always me, isn't it? Always me!
Why don't you do something...?!
A-ah! Ooh!
O-oh-oh!
It shall be arranged exactly as you desire.
[yells in Japanese]
- Watch it.
- Whoa!
- I am sorry.
- Oh, that's all right.
- That's quite all right.
- Domo.
- It was actually our fault.
- Well...
We should have knocked.
We'd just like to ask you...
We'd just like to ask you a few more questions.
Oh... sorry.
I only use to cook...
I never think of using to kill someone.
- Well, now, we never said that.
- No. We just want to ask you
- a few more routine questions.
- That's right.
- If you're innocent, you're innocent.
- Whoa!
- If you're guilty, a hanging.
- Argh!!
- Just let me handle this.
- Sorry. Sorry. Didn't mean that.
[In Japanese]
I am sorry, too.
[in Japanese]
Sorry.
- Ask him where he gets his hair done.
- Yeah, I will.
Just let me handle this.
- I'll handle it, OK?
- Right.
I'll handle it.
All right. Ah...
Now where are you from?
Ah... so.
- What did you call me?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Ah...
- I am from Nara.
- Ah... how are you spelling that?
- Nara. Na-ni-nu-ne-no-no-na...
Not to confuse
"Na-to-do-na-na-pe-no-na".
- So, Na-...
- I got it. I got it. I got it.
Now exactly where were you when the Morleys left to dine...
- with the Bradford's?
- I was in bed.
That's spelled "bed",
"ba-bi-bu-be-bo"...
I know how to spell that.
Did you kill the Morleys?
Ikorosi nai the Morleys!
What do you mean, you crosinize the Moneys?
I said, I korosi nai the Morleys!
You mean, you crosinize the Moneys?
I said, I didn't murder!
[yelling]
What are you doing?
Just fixing that door...
- Little squeaking and that.
- Be more quiet about it.
Sorry.
Huh? sorry- sorry
- Will you, please, stop nodding?
- Right.
Right. He wants us to...
-...nodding. I'm trying to tell him.
- We'll look around.
[in Japanese]
How about a nice bowl of fish eyes?
Will you pardon me, please?
Thank you.
You... you like humming bird cookies?
No, thank you.
Thank you.
- Well, come on, let's start looking.
- Right.
Let's see... corn...
- What we're looking for?
- We're looking for evidence.
You, er... you suspect that
Mr. Uwatsum?
Aaugh!
You dummy!
Ah...
I suspect everyone.
That's my job.
Everybody here had a motive to kill the Morleys.
You now what I think?
What are you doing?
- Huh?
- What in the world are you doing?!
- Peaches...
- What?
[mumbling]
Want some?
Stop spitting on me!
- Come on before I drown!
- All right!
Well, one thing is clear.
Whoever wrote that letter knew the Morleys were murdered. Here.
Get this message off to the Yard.
Find out if they have any records on the Morley staff.
Come in.
Mister Uwatsum made you some tea.
Really?
Did he get it from a buzzard?
"Did he get it from a buzzard"!
Dummkopf.
Dummkopf!
- Dummkopf!
- What?
Dumb dummkopf!
- She has a wonderful personality.
- I'll get this message off.
[sound of gunshots]
You know what I think?
I think there's someone here who doesn't want anyone to know that there's someone here who might be someone that's a killer.
You know what I think? For a short person you have long sentences.
Better drink that tea before that foam settles.
Wait a minute. Tea... isn't supposed to foam!
Here... stir.
Well let's go ask that Yokohama
Yo-yo about his secret recipes.
Mr. Uwatsum?
Mr. Uwatsum!
- He's dead.
- Are you sure?
See...
- Boo!
- Ahhh!
He's dead, all right.
He didn't even move.
Here... read that note..
Out loud, you dummy!
"In this house it's hard to survive.
Some will be dead who are now alive."
"Mr. Uwatsum has gone
'cause he knew too much."
"Bye for now, but rest assured we'll keep in constant contact with each other."
- "Keep in... knew too much..."
- Let's get Miss Phyllis!
Worst thing I ever saw.
Like a Japanese... shish kebab. Come on, tell her. Tell her!
Excuse me, Miss Phyllis.
You'd better come with us.
Why? What's the matter?
It's... er... Mr. Uwatsum.
He... er...
Follow us, please.
- Horrible sight.
- Is he?
Oh, God.
[thunderclap]
Your cook and dinner had something in common...
They're both dead ducks.
Right in here.
He's gone!
Are you sure there was a body in here?
- Of course we're sure!
- And he was dead, too!
I gave him the test.
Boo!
See? He moved.
That body never moved.
He was gone.
Well, there doesn't seem to be a body here now.
Whatever it was, didn't like chickens.
Couldn't have been a wookalar, they like chickens. You know, they said one time that one ate seventeen alive.
- Feathers and all.
- Would you shut up?
If you don't mind,
I'll return to the study.
B--B... there was... a body in there...
There was a body in there, wasn't there?
Without a doubt.
I think.
I'm going to send a message to the Yard.
I'll inform them there's been another murder and we are working on it.
Trouble...
Excuse me.
What happened?
Must have been a relative.
Come on. Let's go and try to get some information out of these wackos.
[wolf howling]
Pardon me...
Pardon me, sir.
Er, what are you digging?
I am digging for worms.
I go fishing every night.
I see...
Er, let me ask you something.
When you sealed
Lord Morley's coffin...
-was he in it at the time?
- Of course!
But Lord Morley had a great fear of being buried.
- Well, most folks do.
- No.
He said he wanted come back to life.
And he wanted a way to get out.
The crypt was built to be unlocked from the inside.
[thunderclap]
You mean, so he can get out?
Right! Jock made it that way!
You don't suppose that this Morley guy has actually figured out a way
- to come back from the dead, do you?
- Of course not! Who ever has?
Well then why would he make a coffin that you can get out of?
Obviously, the man... wasn't very bright!
Wasn't that what Phyllis said?
Yeah. I would...
You know, they say that wookalars figured out a way to come back.
Don't start.
Let's to go talk to Jock before we're buried alive.
[wolves howling]
Argh!
Argh!
Argh!
- What is this Jock guy is doing?
- Sounds like he's doing push-ups.
Argh!
Argh!
Jock?
Argh!
Jock?
Jock?
I wonder where he is?
What are you trying to do, kill us or something?!
Neers! Neers! Horse Neers!
Wonder if he's got relatives in Notre Dame.
Listen, we want to ask you some questions.
Neers! Step back!
- What?
- I think he said "beers".
Three? Three beers!
No!
You're standing in horse neers!
He's right.
Standing in horse neers.
Wait a minute! We'd like to ask you about Lord Morley's crypt!
Aaaargh!
Oooh!
- Tibet?
- Must have saw a worm.
Come on!
[thunderclap]
[thunderclaps]
Mr. Tibet!
Mr. Tibet!
Boy, when he digs for worms, he really gets in there, doesn't he?
I think he's dead!
Look at that!
"To dig your own grave is quite a sight."
"But to bury yourself is not very bright."
"There are more to kill and the job will be done."
"Now there are five.
Soon there will be a lot less."
There will be fresh tracks here.
Come on! Let's go get Jock and his dogs on this trail.
Jock!
Hello!
- Jock!
- Hey!
Jock!
- Hey, what's that?
- What?
- That sound!
- I don't hear any sound.
Ah...
"if Jock could talk, he'd give you a clue."
"But now that he's dead, what can you do?"
"He deserved what he got,
I don't regret it a bit."
"By the way, you're standing in bull ca-ca."
- What?
- Right.
Let's get back to Phyllis then.
[thunderclap]
[thunderclap]
[thunderclaps]
These people are dropping like flies!
I am sorry, Inspector, but I could find no bodies either in the graveyard, or the stables.
What do you mean, there were no bodies?!
I tell you there were two bodies out there!
Now they didn't just get up and walk away!
I said, there are no bodies... either in the graveyard or the stables.
I searched the entire estate!
Perhaps you've been working too hard.
I'm telling you, there were bodies out there!
Didn't you see two bodies out there?
Well, you have been working pretty hard.
You dope!
You saw them, too!
Well, that's right! I did.
There were two bodies out there.
If you say so, sir.
How am I going to find any clues without any bodies?
- Another glass of pus?
- No, I don't want another glass of pus!
Don't you realize that you're next unless we get to the bottom of this?
- Somebody here is the killer!
- Unless...
Morley's ghost did it.
Ugh...
Tell me you believe that, too.
He claimed he had the power to return from the dead.
They say that wookalars have the power to return from the dead, too, and they only have a brain the size of a pea!
In that case you'd have a tough time getting into the group!
I'm telling you, there are no ghosts!
Was that the...?
Maybe I do need a little rest.
[thunderclap]
[thunderclaps]
Get those notes, will you?
That buzzard pus... is backing up on me.
Try to throw up.
Just get the notes.
You know what my mother said would make you throw up?
Drink a glass of warm milk with lard in it.
Chunks and all.
Or tear fly's wings off and let it walk around in the back of...
Have you had pudding with cat hair in it?
Is that right?
Did she say that before they took her away or after?
Say what you want, but
I'll tell you one thing.
Mother always talked about you.
- Is that right?
- That's right.
What she always used to say?
She said, "if you had another brain, it'd be lonesome".
You know what else she said?
She'd say, you weren't worth the powder to blow you up.
Do you know what else she said?
She used to say...
- Get the notes!
- Right.
Hey
Goat's gone.
- Where did you put it?
- In there.
- Well, then it's still in there.
- I just looked.
Look again!
- Hey, my coat's back.
- Good. You solved that case.
- This is a note.
- Read the note.
"I said when I died that I'd come back."
"if you believe in ghosts, you're on the right track."
"I'm out of the grave and roaming the moors."
"if you want to be safe, you'd better lock all the windows and screens."
Are you out of your gourd?
Look at that.
Hey, where are the notes?
I don't know. They were in there. Now this is there.
I suppose that you're going to tell me that a ghost put that note in there.
- I was thinking about it.
- Well, I'm telling you...
-there's no such thing as a ghost!
- Is that right?
Well, a wookalar was a ghost in the Barkley Mountain Mystery!
You know what it did?
Ripped open a horse's stomach... and ate it! You know what else?
Tore off a pig's head, sucked its... brains right out its nose.
Just... right out.
[choking sounds]
Stop it!
- That's all make-believe anyway!
- Is that right? Tell that to the pig!
[sucking sounds]
But...
Lord Morley is dead and buried.
- Can I ask you something?
- What?
If you actually saw Lord Morley's body, would you believe he was dead?
- I guess so.
- Then let's go.
Where are you going?
To prove that there is no ghost.
You're not going down to the mausoleum and dig up the...
Oh, boy.
Sucked its brains right out of its nose.
[thunderclap]
[thunderclaps]
Get that candle.
Got it!
Light it.
Here...
Aaugh!
Ugh!
Hey, what's that?
It stopped.
There it is.
Does it sound like this?
Yeah!
That's us.
I'll get it.
Lady Morley.
[thunderclap]
Now that one.
Achoo!
Lord Morley.
[thunderclap]
Let's get that slab off.
Aaah!
Ah! Ah!
Ah! Ah!
- Oh!
- Aaargh'
Aah! Oooh!
- Ah! Ah!
- It's a dog.
My ha--my hands...
Ah!
Quiet! Shhh!
- There.
- Open up.
Flip ya for it.
Call it.
Heads.
Open it!
Aaaaargh!
Aaah! Ooh! Aaah!
What was that?!
Aaaah!
Oh! Oooh!
You know something?
That Lord Morley... is ugly enough to scare a wookalar.
And they don't scare very easy.
- What do you think?
- I'll tell you what I think...
Aaaah!
Hey... she really goes for you, huh?
Are you kidding?!
She's dead!
Hey, a note!
Let me see that.
- Let me see.
- Read that.
"Hilda is dead and there is something to note."
"You can't bury her at sea,
'cause her bosoms will float."
Why would anybody want to kill Hilda anyway?
' Ugh...
- I got it!
- Maybe she wouldn't do windows.
- Will you...?
Look!
- You stay here with the body!
- Ah... right.
[woman's screams]
Don't go away.
What do you think you're doing?!
Get that off of me!
[yelling]
Come off me!
[woman's screams]
Tart, come here!
Tart!
What are you doing?!
What do you think, what am I doing?!
Get down here! Get her off of me!
Ugh!
What were you doing, creeping around?!
I... heard some noises downstairs, so I came downstairs to see what was going on.
I'll tell you what's going on. There's a dead body up there. Come on!
Come, get moving!
We'll show you! Go on!
Well, go on! Go on! Go on!
Just get going!
Get... get...
Yes, the, er, body is right there in the...
Come on!
It's right in the elevator here.
We found Hilda right in the...
Yeah. Right down is where she is...
Right there.
There, er... there...
M-hm...
- I want to go lie down.
- I'll join you.
He-he! Ho-ho-ho!
There! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
There, my fine feathered friend!
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
How I'll cook you...
Got any clues yet?
What we got so far, the Morleys murdered... four people being killed, bodies getting up and walking away... and a crate full of dead pigeons.
There's a hole in this.
A lot of holes in this.
Let me think, will you?
No. I mean there's a hole in this!
How did you do that?
I didn't do anything.
It just opened.
It's another passageway.
Don't tell me you're going to try to find out where... you know..
- It goes? Of course!
- Er...
Well, look... why don't I just stay here?
I got a couple of things to rinse out.
Go head.
- Give me some air.
- Well, I don't want to lose you.
Just back off.
Hey...
I wonder what that is!
What is it?
Somebody's bed room.
Hm.
Well, this place must be loaded with secret passages to spy on... people.
- Phyllis.
- Huh?
Yeah.
- That's Phyllis. Must be her bedroom.
- Hm. Well, then let's go.
How would you like if someone was watching you in your bedroom?
Hey, wait a minute.
- She's getting undressed.
- Let me up there! Let me get...
I was here first.
These are mine...
- Get off my back!
- I was here first!
Find another passage!
Come on. I'll give you a quarter.
Come on. Half a buck.
Let me see that.
Find another one.
- She's taking off her stockings!
- Let me see that!
I can't see anything.
There's a nose in my way.
She's gone, she's gone.
She's gone!
Nice going.
Let's go. We have work to do.
Er... you know, I was thinking...
Let's mark this spot in case we ever want investigate it again.
Let's go!
[owl hooting]
- Don't lose me.
- I should be that lucky.
- You know where you're going?
- Just shut up and stick with me.
You said you knew where you were going.
Just shut up and light the candles.
If you don't know where you're going, you shouldn't be in the lead.
I think we've know each other long enough and if you don't know you should tell me so, and we won't get into this kind of trouble.
Quiet! Quiet!
Hey...
This... is Justin!
Oh, my gosh!
You don't suppose he...
Holy... eh...
Hello-o... eh...
Hey, look!
- Hm, it's got engraving on this.
- Yeah.
"Now there's one less that has to be fed. But...
Justin can't serve you,
'cause he's dead."
Haah... "The groom was... right, you can't come back.
When you... said there was a ghost, you were on the right trail."
"Trail..."
"You can't come back..."
This is one clue that isn't gonna get away.
You stay here.
I'm gonna get Phyllis.
Good idea. Wait a minute! How...
Don't argue with me now!
What's the matter with you?
- Ever seen a dead man before?
- Yeah, but I--
Just stay here! I want Phyllis to see this for herself!
Y--You got...
How...
- You know the way?
- I know exactly where I'm going!
Ouch!
He's, er... I'm gonna... er...
I... er...
Yo-hoooo!
Hah...
Are you gonna leave me here al... house!
Ah...
Hey! Ha...
Hello?
Yoo-hoo!
Anybody home?
Aaaaah!
We started to explore these passages and found Justin murdered!
Watch your step here.
- Dr. Tart!
- Is he...?
I don't know!
Tart, can you hear me?
- Tart!
- Is he gone?
He's dead.
My long time friend... and companion, Dr. Tart... is dead!
This is awful!
A man who loved his country, his mother... old glory!
Why did I do this?
I took him from... a simple life in Minneapolis, Minnesota... and led him into a life of danger.
Now he's gone.
St. Paul.
What?
- I'm from St. Paul, not Minneapolis.
- Why do you do that to me?!
Could I hear that pan about my mother again?
We've got work to do!
Where is Justin?
- I don't know. He's gone!
- Gone where?
Well, that's what I wanted to tell you. I saw something...
- I can't tell you.
- Why?!
- 'Cause you'll get mad.
- What?
I think I saw a wookalar.
[grunts]
Aaaah!
I told you you would.
Ahh...
Told you.
Come on.
Wait a minute.
Let me come with you. I...
[strains]
Hey!
Wait for... ah!
- It's become obvious that someone...
- Or something.
Someone is trying to do in this entire household!
I still say it's something.
Disregarding a ghost, I'd say it would be to Nanny's advantage to have me and the entire staff out of the way, then she would inherit the fortune.
[woman screams]
You don't suppose that...
We'll have our next case in a smaller house.
Oh' my...
You'd better stay here.
This may not be pleasant.
A horrible way to go.
Looks like she's been...
[thunderclap]
Aaargh!
Aaaah!
Uh!
- There is no note!
- Hm...
Let's take a look at this...
Listen up, dummies.
The help is all gone.
The house is bare.
Now you know a shadow lives there.
There is one left to die, and my job will be done.
I like killing people.
It's a lotta kicks.
This doll will self-destruct.
We've got to contact the Yard.
Get a pigeon!
Gotta contact the Yard.
The Yard? I see no reason to bring them in. I mean... you're the detectives.
Can't you find this thing that's trying to scare us?
Scare us?!
This thing is killing us!
We've got to get somebody here... before this body takes off!
Tart?
Hurry up!
I'd better stay with the body.
What is this?
A one day body service?
Look at this. The squadron leader,
Captain Buster... has been murdered.
All right... stand back!
- Watch it!
- Thanks!
That's... that's Lord Morley's
Bengal lance spear.
- It should have been buried with him.
- Hey, there's a note on it.
"Now you will see
I can do something right."
"lam going to show you a killer tonight."
"I want Phyllis to come to my chamber and see... who was the one... who murdered Lady Morley... and myself."
It's for you.
It's signed, "Lord Morley".
This is his signature.
[thunderclap]
Aha.
It says for you to come to his room, so you'd better get going.
She's not going anywhere!
This is our job!
Are you kidding? Did you read that?
Says there's going to be a killer there.
I know what it says!
I recognize that key.
It's the key... to Lord Morley's torture chamber.
He was the only one that ever went in there.
It's getting late. You should go.
Shut up! You and I are gonna get to the bottom of this, not Phyllis. Here.
Make yourself a cup of tea, we will see to this.
- I'll have one, too, my throat...
- Come on!
- See what you did to me?
- Ah...
Let's both have a cup of tea and settle our nerves.
Go ahead.
Hey. you go.
Go first, come on!
Get the candle.
Are you gonna light it?
Come on.
Don't let that door... shut.
Nice going.
Boy... this place gives me the creeps.
A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
I don't think we're alone.
- I'm gonna go get us tea.
- No, it's alright, just an echo.
A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
You have to keep doing that?
Ahh!
What's the matter?!
Wax on my hand!
What are you trying to do to me, give me a heart attack?!
Hello.
Right... just stick with me.
Tart?
Tart?
Tart!
Aaaah!
L...
Get around there!
- I made a shortcut.
- All right... let's go through there.
[wolf howling]
Ah! Ah!
Ah! Ah!
Eh?
[yells in surprise]
Where are you going?!
Ah!
- Where are you going?
- Wait a minute!
Hey!
It's a meat chopper!
Get me out of this thing!
Grab the legs!
Not my legs, the chair legs!
Aaaah!
Tart!
It's a convertible!
[both yelling]
Cut the rope!
Right... I get it!
- Got a pair of scissors?
- Are you crazy?!
Cut the rope!
I'll be right back!
Don't go away!
- Where would I go, you idiot?!
- I'll look at that tin man.
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Can I borrow this ax?
Help!
Got a guy in trouble here.
Gimme it!
- Help!
- I've got to get thing!
Tart!
Cut the rope!
Working on it!
Tart!!!
Here it comes!
OK!
I'll just...
Er...
- How'd you do that?
- Never mind, I saw the killer!
We gotta get to Phyllis!
Let me out of this thing!
Here... I'll just push you...
Ah! Ah!
- You OK?
- I'm gonna kill you one of these days.
[thunderclap]
- Ah... ah...
- Oh, boy...
- That's...
- That's a snake in the box.
- Let's get out of here!
- Right...
Ah...
Ah...
Oh...
[scared whispers]
L...
I think they hear with their tongues.
Mmm... mmm...
- That thing could eat a horse!
- Lets' get out of here!
- We can't walk with it out there.
- There must be a lever, a button... something that opens that door!
Ah!
- That's it!
- Aaaah!
- Oh!
- Ah...
I found it!
- Oh... what in the...
- Hey.
Where are we?!
I don't know.
You stink.
Hey...
Some kind of garbage container.
At least we know one thing, there is a killer!
- We've got to get to Phyllis!
- Yeah.
Hey... wait a minute!
This is a garbage crusher!
- Hey!
- God, it's awful!
- What are you doing?
- Eating it up for more room!
That's not gonna get us more room, you dummy!
Help!
Help!
Oh, help! Help!
- Help!
- Help!
[tired sighs]
- Scent of lemon...
- Ahhh!
I feel awful.
You stink, too!
We gotta get to Phyllis before that thing gets to her!
I think I ate a light bulb.
[thunderclap]
[thunderclap]
[thunderclap]
The gun's all wet.
Hold it!
- I'm glad we caught you in time!
- Yeah.
You gotta come with us.
You won't be needing that.
We'll handle this.
- So you figured it out, did you?
- Yeah, right.
I knew you knew.
You knew we knew you knew what?
You knew all along that
I killed Lady and Lord Morley.
Er... well, we figured that"
We didn't figure that, did we?
No! We figured you might be in danger because of the Shadow.
- He's our killer!
- There's no Shadow.
- I killed the Morleys.
- There is too a Shadow.
We saw it. Tell her we saw the Shadow.
- I was, ah... I didn't...
- Tell her.
Er...
Now look. There's...
- a lot more going on here...
- Save your breath!
It's about to be your last!
I don't know what you saw and who's doing all the killing around here.
But I am pulling out of this place with the money.
All I have to do is rid myself of you two.
You don't suppose we had this figured wrong, do you?
Dead wrong.
But why would you kill
Lord and Lady Morley?
Don't you know why?
Well, I'll tell you why.
I needed more and more money to support my gambling habit.
But the Morleys wouldn't give any more cash to their little daughter Phyllis.
So I figured, the easiest way to get my hands on their fortune was to knock them off and I was right.
So it was you in the back seat of the car.
Correct... dummy.
And now I must bid you... farewell!
Aaaah!
Ah!
Aaaah! Aaaah! Aaaaah!
[screaming]
Shadow!
Hold right there!
Or I'll shoot!
What's the matter with this gun?!
The trigger's stuck!
It'll go off at 2 o'clock!
Give me the other gun!
Give me it!
- Hurry!
- Hold it right there!
A gun! A gun!
Give me a gun!
Come on!
Come on!
I can't get it out!
All right, give me your leg!
Raise it!
- [painfully moaning]
- Aim! Fire!
Aaah!
It's a perfect hit!
We did it! We did it!
We did it!
Aaaaah!
- Ooooh!
- Aaaah!
Aaaah...
Lord Morley!
The staff's back!
How could they be? I mean,
Justin was hanging by the cuckoo, and she had a knife in her...
Now look...!
I think I'll... f... faint...
Ahhhhhh...
A great pity... my dear.
Killer!
Slot machine freak!
Yeah!
Now let me make sure
I've got the story straight.
Certainly.
When I returned to my motorcar on that... fatal evening, I spotted Phyllis in the rear-view mirror.
Before I could do anything, she hit me over the head
and rendered me unconscious.
My motorcar hit the lagoon,
I was dazed.
However, I managed to get out of the car and swim to the surface.
I summoned the entire stuff to the mausoleum and there we concocted this charade of phony killings... hoping to force Phyllis into a confession.
It worked perfectly!
He-he... well, that's just exactly the way we had it figured.
- Eh...
- We did?
Yes, we did.
I must congratulate you both.
I shall inform the Yard that this case was handled with great skill.
Hah, well, thank you.
Well, if you ever get killed again, be sure and call us.
Yes... Dr. Tart's always being funny.
Come on.
- He-he...
- Bye!
Good bye! Good bye!
See you on the weekend.
Eh...
What's that?
That is a valuable gift from Lord Morley.
It came from an ancient
Egyptian tomb.
It is 3000 years old.
Altogether now... one-two-three...
Heave!
Some reward. Another body.
Put that thing away!
Slow down, will you?!
My nerves are shot!
Better turn off the time-gun.
- Well, I guess we're on our way now.
- Yeah. You know something?
Now that we solved this
Morley case, maybe the chief... could put us on the wookalar case.
How many times do I have to tell you there's no such thing as a wookalar.
I wouldn't be too sure of that.
They said somebody down in Old Bridge Forest came face to face... with one.
Ugliest thing you ever saw.
A face like a pig, big snoot, two tusks coming up like that...
Tore a big hole in the barn with a single swipe.
[grunting]
You can grunt if you want to, but I believe in wookalars.
Hah! I don't know howl put up with you.
Believing in... a crazy thing like that.
A guy that looks like a pig!
[grunting]
Ha-ha-ha!
[snorting]
- Aaaaaah!
- It's a wookalar!
- Now do you believe me, huh?
- Throw him a chicken!
You'd better hurry or he'll suck our brains out!
The fish are dead!
The truck. Please, Mr. Huberty.
Quickly, come on.
What do you know about Baal-Dahar?
Baal-Da-what?
I was in Jerusalem for a symposium.
Why am I here?
Baal-Dahar's an Arab village.
It's rumoured to be a terrorist base.
I should say "was."
This morning we found it destroyed.
What does that have to do with me?
It's how it was destroyed.
That's where we need your help.
My help? I know nothing about terrorists.
I think you've made a terrible mistake.
Please, come with me.
You don't understand. I'm the wrong man.
I can't help you. I'm a meteorologist!
We know.
That's why we brought you here.
You see that...
...was Baal-Dahar.
Yesterday, a kibbutz nearby was attacked.
They threw a petrol bomb into the school.
Thirty-four children burned to death.
We tracked the terrorists back to here and found this.
It's incredible.
- Can you explain it?
- It cannot be explained.
- I have clearance.
- You damn well better.
The Vatican.
I'm sorry...
...Father Lucci.
Can you explain it?
With the proper equipment, I think...
I don't think so.
They'll never explain it.
It'll melt in a day or a week and they'll forget it.
They'll call it a freak, an aberration.
You don't think it is.
I would, Colonel, except this kind of thing happened here once before.
Baal-Dahar has been here for 3,000 years.
But you see, Baal-Dahar was built on the ruins of an older place.
A much older place.
And it too was destroyed.
But you wouldn't want that to explain this.
Why is that?
Because that place that was destroyed was called Sodom.
Destroyed by the wrath of God.
How's he doing?
I have to tell you, he's still a boy.
- Is he kicking a lot?
- He's very active. Moves all over the place.
That's great. We're getting some good soccer in our last trimester.
I can't wait. Two months to go.
I want to see you next week.
I'm not completely happy with his growth.
And your amniotic fluid is a little less than normal.
But you said he's doing fine.
He is. There's nothing to be alarmed about.
But I can't say definitely that we won't run into the same problem again.
I know this time it'll be okay.
I've been eating really well and resting.
That's good.
So I'll see you both next week.
"... have seen the glory
Of the coming of the Lord
"He has trampled out the vintage
Where the grapes of wrath are stored
"He has loosed his fateful lightning
Of his terrible swift sword
"His truth is marching on"
They're so adorable.
Would you like to see the computer room now?
At the Oaks we start them early.
So your husband is a lawyer...
...and you restore fine arts for the Hirshenson Collection.
- And the baby's due...
- February 29th.
- It's leap year.
- Of course.
I notice you didn't write anything under
"Religious Denomination."
Do you mind if I ask why?
Because I don't have any.
Is that a problem?
No, no. I just don't like blanks.
Hi, baby dog.
Ace, be careful. Good boy.
Hello?
Well, let's see.
It's $650, utilities included.
It's a garage apartment.
No, no problems with the fumes.
We park our car outside.
It's partially furnished. There's a bed and a table right now, but that's about it.
I see. Well, okay. Sorry.
Hi, sweetness.
Tragedy continues to strike
around the globe...
.... As the changing
weather patterns continue.
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.
- That's nice.
- Thanks.
How did it go today?
The State Supreme Court denied my appeal.
- Are you kidding?
- I couldn't believe it.
- I thought you had such a strong appeal.
- So did I.
So did I.
The whole petition was based on the fact that Jimmy's trial lawyer was incompetent.
I've told you that. I thought I proved it.
Shit. What are you going to do?
Appeal again. Fight it.
Anyway, how's our bouncing baby boy?
Good. We had a good day.
Good.
I know we talked about it and decided not to...
...but I went to the Oaks today and put down a deposit.
It only puts us on the waiting list for four years.
Why are you doing this?
I just want to be prepared.
I want you to be realistic.
- I am realistic.
- We don't know for sure if the baby...
I saw Dr. Inness today.
She said I'm doing perfect. No problems.
Really?
This baby is going to be fine.
It has to be.
It has to be? What if it isn't? Then what?
I just don't want to lose you, that's all.
Okay?
Okay.
Will you die for Him?
Will you die for Him?
What is it?
What's the matter?
I was in these rooms.
Oh, God, I could feel it coming.
Death.
It was just a dream, Abby.
It was just a dream.
It's all right.
It was just a dream.
Russell Quinn?
Penny Washburn. Sorry I'm late.
I understand you're quite an expert on death sentence appeals.
So they say.
What do you know about this case?
So far, not much.
The kid murdered his parents?
He poured gasoline on them and set them on fire while they were sleeping.
I take it this is not someone with a lot of remorse.
His parents were brother and sister.
"Executed for the word of God" is what he said in his signed confession.
Jimmy...
- How's it going?
- Hello, Russell.
This is Penny Washburn.
She's going to help us with your case.
- Hello, Penny.
- Hello.
- Can we talk a minute?
- Yes.
Penny's going to help me prepare a new appeal...
...but we'll need your help.
I told you, I do not go to hospital.
I can't help you unless you let me.
Just talk to her, tell her what happened, that's all.
No hospital.
Jimmy, this is important.
If you go to the hospital, the doctors may find you incompetent.
Then the court will reconsider your case.
Otherwise, we don't have anything.
I know what is right and I know what is wrong.
I did nothing wrong.
You admitted killing your parents.
It was not wrong. It was the law of God.
Leviticus.
Isn't murder a crime too, in the eyes of God?
It is not murder to punish the guilty.
Incest may be against the law of God...
...but it's the law of California that we're dealing with.
They've sentenced you to the gas chamber!
Do you want to die?
No.
Then go to the hospital and let the doctors see if you knew what you were doing.
That says I did a crime!
That it was wrong!
If it'll save your life, say you're wrong!
What is it going to matter?
It matters to God!
No hospital.
Goodbye, Penny.
Jimmy, think about it. Please.
- Hello.
- Hi.
My name is David.
David Bannen.
I'm here about the apartment.
Please, come in.
Ace, get down! He usually doesn't do this. Go on, get down.
It's okay. Hi, Ace.
Get down!
I'm surprised. He never does this.
I'll go get the keys.
Would you like a towel? You're soaked.
It's terrible out there, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
If I can just find these keys.
Where are you from?
All over. I've moved around a lot.
- Because of work?
- Yes.
What do you do?
I'm a teacher. Ancient languages.
Over at the university?
I've been travelling for some time.
I've really just come back to town.
May I have some water?
Sure. Let me get you a glass.
- Use the bottled water, it's better.
- Thanks.
Your baby is due in February.
The 29th.
How did you know?
I saw your calendar.
It's kind of nice.
There isn't a 29th except leap year.
Makes it special somehow.
It is a special day.
I am getting so absent-minded.
I hope you're not expecting something fancy.
This is it.
It's a bit small.
I don't need much room.
I'd like it.
- Lf that's all right.
- That's great!
I'll discuss it with my husband, but I'm sure it won't be a problem.
Call me tomorrow and I'll let you know.
- Fine.
- We'll talk then.
I do hope this will work out.
I hope so, too.
I'm back.
That didn't take very long.
He didn't need much help.
About all he had was a suitcase.
But he did have first and last month's rent in cash.
Did you ask him to dinner?
I did. He said, "No, thanks."
Of course, he didn't use so many words.
The guy is out there.
He's a little bit different.
I don't know, I think he's just quiet.
He's quiet all right.
He doesn't have a stereo or a television.
He doesn't even want a telephone.
Really? That's weird.
What's weird is that he has a short-wave radio.
You think he's a spy?
The spearhead of an invasion force that will take over and bore us to death!
You're such a nut. Toss that up.
- Where are you going?
- I'm sure you did a great job inviting him.
Looks tossed to me.
- Jesus, you scared me to death.
- You snuck up on me!
I was trying not to scare you.
What are you doing?
Look at this. Isn't this wild?
Yeah, it is strange.
David's in the house.
He changed his mind about dinner.
Maybe he'd change it again if he saw you snooping.
I'm not snooping.
I'm looking.
So after all that, the senator wouldn't even see me.
This poor kid will die in the gas chamber and I get this aide who tells me...
...he doesn't think their involvement is appropriate.
Why?
Because he's a politician.
He won't get involved in anything that could come back and bite his fat ass.
- It's typical.
- It's typical bullshit.
What would you do?
Me? What do you mean?
Would you stop it?
Of course I would, but I have no control.
I can't do anything.
Maybe you can.
She can't do anything, David.
That's what I'm saying, nobody listens anymore. I'm the kid's attorney...
...and they won't listen to me.
So they won't listen to Abby.
Maybe you are right.
It's not up to us.
- How about dessert?
- Please.
Jesus Christ! Look at this!
Get a broom.
Please don't!
I wasn't going to hurt it.
I'm sorry.
That was weird.
Do you know...
...there's a story about a new-born child and the sparrow's song.
It's ancient.
Hebrew.
They believed that in Heaven...
...God's mansion has many halls.
And that one of these halls is the Hall of Souls.
It's called The Guf.
"The Guf"?
They say whenever a baby is born...
...this is where its soul comes from.
As the soul descends from heaven...
...only the sparrows can see it.
So they sing.
So whenever you hear a sparrow sing, you know a baby's about to be born?
The Guf. I like it.
I'll get the dessert.
- Would you like some coffee?
- Yes, please.
Wasn't that the sweetest story?
It sounded like a bunch of guff to me.
"The second angel poured his bowl into the sea.
"And it became as the blood of a dead man...
"... and every living thing...
"... died that was in the sea."
The prophecies...
...they have begun.
The Guf.
Do you like that?
I do. It reminds me of a story I heard.
It's Italian. Really good quality.
I don't know. I've spent so much money already.
But it's so cute. Yeah, why not?
You only live once, right?
Will this be on your card?
Mrs. Quinn, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Shit.
Excuse me, lady.
What are you doing here?
I'm looking for someone.
There's no one here but the minyan.
I followed him in, he's wearing a grey coat.
No one came in.
But I followed him in.
I've been here ten minutes.
No one has come in.
You okay?
Are you okay, lady?
Yes, I'm fine.
You better leave now.
We don't want to disturb kaddish.
Kaddish. The prayer for the dead.
You're going to be fine.
This won't hurt.
You'll just feel some pressure.
Don't hurt my baby.
- Keep breathing.
- Take a deep breath.
Just take a deep breath. There you go.
We're almost through.
You're doing just fine.
Just hold still. Breathe.
Take a deep breath.
Breathe. Nice and easy. Nice and easy.
You're doing a good job.
It's going to come out now.
Good job, good job.
Why does this keep happening to her?
It's too early for Caesarean.
Right. The baby's lungs aren't fully matured yet.
But the immediate threat is over.
Right now we have to keep her from going into labour for at least two weeks.
I've started her on ritodrine again.
Can she go home?
No. I want to keep her here for 48 hours.
She needs to rest as much as possible...
...both mentally and physically.
- Can I see her?
- Sure.
There she is.
How are you feeling?
It's not like the last time.
Don't even think about that.
Just rest.
I know that feeling. It's different this time.
Something else is causing it.
The pain isn't even the same.
It's not coming from the inside.
Margaret said you can come home in a couple of days.
Then a couple days in bed, you'll be as good as new.
Why won't she believe me?
Can't she find out what's really going on?
She's trying, Abby.
I know something's happening.
It's different this time.
I know it is.
"The third angel poured his bowl into the rivers, and they became...
"... blood."
Reports of more fighting near
the Nicaraguan border today.
In the fiercest confrontation of the year,
casualties are mounting on both sides.
Refugee camps have sprung up
in areas considered safe...
.... But even these have received sniper fire.
I love the news.
- How are you feeling?
- Good.
- Want some dinner?
- Want me to cook?
I'll take care of it.
How about some pasta primavera?
- Do you know how long that'll take?
- Twenty minutes. I'll go pick it up.
.... Rescuers can only watch
the great beings gasp for breath...
.... Away from what had always been,
for them and us...
.... The protective sea.
Locally, a different kind of tragedy today.
A drive-by shooting between rival gangs
claimed the lives...
.... Of a woman and her 4-year-old child.
Caught in the crossfire...
The death toll in this latest
terrorist bombing is expected to climb...
Bloodshed in the war
between Iraq and Iran...
.... Raped repeatedly, her body was dumped...
.... Was apparently set by representatives
of a radical...
In international news...
.... French officials announced
they have two suspects...
.... In the bombing
of the Champs Elysées restaurant...
Abby.
I'm sorry.
It's okay. I thought you were away.
I just came back.
No, please.
I just wanted to...
How do you feel?
I'm all right.
I thought I saw you the other day, in the rain.
I wasn't sure if it was you, but I thought you might need a ride.
You are very kind.
That's rare.
Were you there?
So much misery.
Man against man.
They kill each other. They have no faith.
I used to think the world would change...
...but it hasn't.
No, I guess it hasn't.
It's sad.
The course is chosen...
...and it can't be turned.
What do you mean, "course"?
Toward death.
I really don't think we'll blow ourselves up.
I didn't mean that.
I better go upstairs now.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry about the baby.
After all your travels, Father Lucci...
...you've reached these conclusions?
- I have, Your Eminence.
You have no doubt, no doubt whatsoever, regarding the signs?
No doubt at all. They were not signs.
Not to try your patience, Father, but once again:
The snow in the Negev.
Didn't the Israeli Army report that?
I was there.
I saw a freak, an aberration of convective showers.
Frigid air from the Balkans was swept into a cut off low.
It created a storm of such intensity, it sucked the freezing rain from the sky.
It turned everything in its path to ice.
A rare occurrence.
It happens once in 100 years.
But a sign from God?
Everything you saw...
...was either scientifically explainable or a hoax?
Yes, Your Eminence.
My brothers, all these things I saw were of the natural world.
There have been no miracles.
These were not signs of the Apocalypse.
I will tell His Holiness.
He will be quite relieved.
He has tickets next week to Faust.
"2- 29." That's the baby's birthdate.
I can't understand any of this.
What about the baby's birthdate on it?
We don't have a corner on February 29th.
You don't know that's what that means.
Have you ever seen strange writing like this?
And what about those horrible clippings?
Russell, he's here because of the baby!
You think David is responsible for what's wrong with the baby?
What's wrong with the baby is called placental insufficiency!
You're wrong! I told you, it's different!
It isn't! Nobody is trying to hurt the baby.
It's just like last time.
Abby, what do you want me to do?
Kick him out?
Would that make you feel better?
All right. He's gone.
I'll tell him as soon as I see him.
I'm looking for Dr. Ornstein.
Rabbi Ornstein.
You stay.
Are you Dr. Ornstein, the linguist?
Among other things. May I help you?
I hope so. I'm Abby Quinn.
Nice move, lady.
- What'd I do?
- You touched him.
You don't touch a Hasidic rabbi unless you're his wife.
- Are you serious?
- No. I'm making it up.
It's halakah. It's the law.
- I should apologise.
- I wouldn't do that.
Just leave. He won't see you again.
I have to see him.
I need to know what language this is.
That's Melachim.
It's Melachim.
It's a secret form of Hebrew, like a code.
In the Middle Ages, scholars used it to protect their writings.
You know it?
I hope so. I learned it from him when I was nine.
Then you can translate it?
I guess so. It's just a simple replacement alphabet.
Come on. There's a book I'll need.
Here it is.
So, what is this?
How does this date translate?
That's not a date.
Of course it is. 2-29. February 29th.
- Have you ever read the Bible?
- Well, yeah.
Well, 2:29, it's a Bible heading.
Chapter and verse.
Chapter 2, verse 29.
Are you sure?
The whole page is a quote from the Bible.
Book of Joel 2:29.
Can you read it for me?
"Even upon the menservants and maidservants in those days...
"... I will pour out my spirit.
"And I will give portents in the heavens and on the earth...
"... blood and fire and columns of smoke.
"The sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood...
"... before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes."
What is "the great and terrible day"?
When God passes judgement on mankind for its sins.
It's about the Apocalypse.
Come on! The end of the world?
That's what the portents are.
The sun going dark, the moon turning red.
They foretell the end of the world.
There's a whole chain of signs, like a countdown.
Earthquakes, plagues, water turning to blood.
All kinds of weird natural disasters.
They're to warn us that God's wrath is about to destroy the world.
That's what this paper's about?
Yeah, the signs of the end.
Didn't you go to Sunday school?
A long time ago. But they taught us that God was a God of love.
Are you okay?
But what do Biblical prophecies have to do with the baby?
Avi, would you translate it anyway, just to be sure?
Here's my number.
- I guess I could have it for you tomorrow.
- That would be great.
- Bye.
- Okay, Mrs. Quinn.
The Guf, 358.
"Ln Judeo-Christian mythology,
The Guf is the Hall of Souls.
"Every time an infant is born, this is where its soul comes from.
"Folklore says sparrows can see the soul's descent and this explains their song.
"But a day will come when the sparrow sings no more...
"... because there are only a finite number of souls in The Guf.
"Lt's when the last soul is used, and
The Guf is empty, that the world will end.
"The first infant born without a soul...
"... born dead as a soulless child must be, heralds...
"... the death of the world, and so is called...
"... T he Final Sign."
I'm trying to reach the governor.
It's urgent.
I told you it has to do with Jimmy Zaragoza's execution.
Russell, it's Abby.
I've already spoken to his aide.
I need to speak to him directly.
Yes, I'll hold. Tell her I'll call her back.
I tried, but she's not at home.
She says she must speak to you right now.
Cover for me. Abby, are you all...
It's not the baby's birth date, it's from the Bible.
He's here because of the baby.
Slow down.
He thinks it's a Bible sign!
He told us about it, but not the whole story. Listen:
"The first infant born without a soul, born dead as a soulless child must be... "
No, it's not! He's a religious fanatic!
He thinks if he can kill the baby, he'll end the world.
- Listen to me.
- I've got the governor.
Ask him to hold. I want you to go home.
All right? I promise.
Sorry, he wouldn't wait.
Oh, Christ!
Keep working on this and I'll try him from home.
Russell, are you here?
- You won't kill my baby.
- Your baby's dying because it has no soul.
- Don't say that.
- The Guf is empty!
I won't let you kill my baby.
Don't you think I cry for man?
I've tried to intercede, but God has judged!
- Man's sins are...
- Stay away!
I can't die again, Abby. I wish I could.
- I'm His messenger.
- You're crazy.
- I was here before.
- Stay away.
It's time for you to know, Abby.
I came as the Lamb...
...and I return as the Lion.
Now I am His wrath.
Strap her down!
It's happening!
Why won't you believe me?
You have to believe me.
Please.
Will you die for Him?
I don't know what you could have done.
This can happen.
I know the delusions seem extreme, but she's under enormous stress.
There's incredible guilt involved when...
Well, you certainly know the history.
What do we do now?
This sounds pathetic, but the best we can do is wait and see. Watch her.
The baby's fine. He's hanging in there.
If this is just an episode, she can go home in a couple of days.
Will you be able to stay with her?
- Not all the time.
- Then we should get you a nurse to help.
And I think you should go home now and get some serious rest.
Of course, God will judge the world.
- Could it be happening now?
- It could happen any time.
Jesus said the end would come like a thief in the night.
That belief is fundamental to every religion.
Moslem, Christian, Jew, Hindu.
There are differences amongst them as to how it will actually happen...
...but we all believe in a Messiah who delivers God's wrath...
...upon the world.
Then it could be happening.
The moon has turned to blood.
I told you about the paper and the fish.
Yes. In Revelation, it is written that the sea will die.
- Then you do see it?
- With perfect clarity.
I see a young man with a very large imagination.
What you're forgetting is that the prophetic signs are signs.
They're symbols.
They're not meant to be taken literally.
They're poetry written to describe the concept of greater divine judgement...
...not to be checked off like a laundry list.
So the moon and the fish?
Coincidence. You're forgetting the most important aspect of eschatology.
That when the end comes, with it comes eternal life...
...for those of us who are saved.
Well, who'll be saved, Reverend?
The Jew doesn't think it will be the Moslem.
The Moslem doesn't think it will be the Christian.
The Christian doesn't think it will be the Buddhist.
What if nobody is saved?
What if we're all wrong?
My God. What if it's just the Hare Krishnas?
- You're too young to worry so much.
- That's what my rabbi said.
Believe me, Avi, someday you'll make quite a philosopher.
If there is a someday.
Hello, Mr. Quinn. She's fine.
Could you give me that number again?
When? Well, I have to leave.
No, it's impossible...
No, she's upstairs resting.
I'll tell her.
I want my baby.
We still house noviciates here, of course.
But we do get quite a few guests, also.
Mostly people passing through on their way to new parishes.
- Is that what you're doing, Father Lucci?
- Yes, it is.
- Then you won't be staying very long?
- Father Morrell?
May I help you?
No, Father, this is Father Lucci.
I'm sorry. I thought that...
But the resemblance is...
...remarkable.
I don't believe we've met.
No, it couldn't be. That was long ago.
Very long ago.
If you'll excuse me.
But the resemblance...
...it's remarkable!
Really?
Good night, Father.
Abby?
Why is this happening?
God's grace is empty.
There's nothing I can do.
The signs have begun.
As each passes, the end grows closer.
Then why are you here?
I'm its deliverer. I'm its witness.
What if a sign didn't happen?
What if a sign could be stopped before my baby comes? What would happen?
Please, tell me.
Then the chain would be broken.
But it would take something you don't have.
Hope.
How can someone who cared so little for life...
...give life to the world?
I do care.
I'm going to try.
I'm going to try.
Any chance at all, sir?
What can you do now that the federal appeal has been denied?
With less than 24 hours to go, can you do anything to stop the execution?
"The windows of heaven," Mrs. Quinn...
"... the windows of heaven are open and the earth is rent asunder.
"Lt falls...
"... and will not rise again! "
Please, Mrs. Quinn, it doesn't have to be.
How do you know my name?
I followed the signs. They led me to you.
Who are you?
A priest who's come to help you and your baby. We don't have much time.
Please.
I know what you're going through.
I know what's going to happen.
Hey, Mrs. Quinn!
I must know everything he's told you if I'm to help.
He said if I can stop a sign, the chain will be broken.
He said that?
Yes, and God would grant the world a second chance.
Did he tell you which sign to stop?
No, I'm trying to figure it out.
No, no. That's impossible.
A sign can't be stopped.
He wouldn't have told me if there weren't a way.
That's why I have to know the other signs.
You said you knew them.
God has no secrets.
The signs are contained in the seven seals.
The first four have already begun.
The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.
And their signs are almost over.
- The fifth is the death of the last martyr.
- A death could be stopped.
But whose? Where?
- What about the sixth?
- The sun will turn to darkness...
...and the earth will quake and the stars shall fall from the sky.
"And when the Lamb opened the seventh seal...
"... there was silence in heaven."
The silence of The Guf, empty.
The stillbirth of the soulless child.
You are the seventh seal.
I'm not going to let my baby die.
One of the signs has to be stopped.
How? Do you know how?
With hope.
Can hope stop an earthquake?
Can it stop a murder halfway around the globe?
The fourth horseman still rides.
The angels have unleashed the winds from the corners of the earth.
Can you stop that with hope?
Will you die for Him?
Will you die for Him?
No!
You hit him in my dream.
It was no dream.
You were there.
You're not here to help.
You want the world to end.
Yes, Mrs. Quinn. For a very long time.
You are my deliverance.
There's nothing you can do.
You can't stop it.
What kind of God are you?
Let me in!
You were always nosy, Harold.
It is you, Morrell.
But that was 70 years ago.
That was just yesterday to me.
But you haven't aged.
You haven't changed.
In the name of God, how?
In the name of God is how.
I was cursed by Him for what I had done.
I struck a man.
But, of course, He was no man.
He was the Son of God.
I am Cartaphilus.
Pilate's gatekeeper?
The Roman soldier who was...
Cursed to walk the earth until the Messiah returned.
Cursed to live and never die, until it was time for the world to die.
And so it has been for 2,000 years.
For me, there's been no escape from the misery of life.
But I always knew my sentence would not be eternal.
And so, I win!
An end has come! My death is at hand.
I won't be stopped by anyone.
Not her, not you.
I can't allow it.
You understand, don't you, old friend?
Thank you.
Did you see him?
I'm gonna die?
I tried, Jimmy. I did everything I could.
They don't understand.
Do you think God will forgive them?
I don't know.
So we've got to stop this death.
Whose death?
I don't know.
It's somebody who's a martyr.
- That's the fourth sign?
- No, I think it's the fifth.
The last martyr, an earthquake and...
I don't know. I can't think anymore.
You should know this!
That's not my book, it's the New Testament.
Pull over. Pull over there!
- What are you doing?
- Getting us a Bible!
We need a room!
Thirty bucks.
- Got it. Revelation 5. "A Scroll... "
- Read me the sixth sign.
"When he broke the sixth seal, there was a great earthquake...
"... and the sun became black as sackcloth and the moon became red as blood."
An eclipse.
It's on my calendar for tomorrow.
Go back to the fifth sign.
"When He opened the fifth seal, I saw the souls of those slain for the word of God.
"They cried, 'Lord, when wilt thou avenge our blood on those on the earth? '
"They were told to rest until the number of their brethren was complete...
"... who were to be killed as they themselves had been."
The death of the last martyr.
It's someone who dies for the word of God, before the eclipse.
How?
Tortured to death? Murdered?
Executed.
Attorneys were unable to get
a stay of execution for Jimmy Zaragoza...
.... The "Word of God Killer,"
whose parents were brother and sister.
He murdered them, he said,
"because it was God's law."
This morning, Jimmy will die
according to man's law.
Hello?
Abby, where are you?
Russell, I know how to stop it.
An eclipse?
Abby, I can't stop the execution.
You must. He is the last martyr.
You can't let them kill him.
There's nothing I can do.
Tell me where you are.
Abby, are you all right?
I'll meet you at the prison.
No! You can't stop...
I'm going to leave now.
Penny! Thank God! You've got to get me in! You've got to help me.
Okay, breathe, breathe.
Stop!
Somebody stop him!
I did it. It's over.
Somebody...
Somebody help us!
No!
Somebody help us!
It's all right, Abby.
God, no!
Sorry. It's all my fault.
It's all right, Abby.
Breathe deeply.
Relax. Breathe.
All right, push.
- Breathe, Abby.
- Push!
You're fine.
It's all right. You're doing good.
Deep breaths!
Can you do it one more time?
One more time, Abby.
That a girl. Come on, push!
Hold on! The head is out!
Come on, sweetheart, we're almost there!
We've lost the baby's heartbeat.
Will you die for Him?
Will you die for Him?
Yes, I will!
I will die for Him.
I will die for Him.
He's beautiful, Abby...
...just like you said he'd be.
You can't see him...
...but you know.
You always knew.
The Hall of Souls is full again.
It was you, Abby.
Just the one person with hope enough for the whole world.
Remember it all.
Write it down.
Tell it...
...so people will use the chance she has given them.
Marie?
Good morning, Crumb & Crumb
Detective Agency. Please hold.
Yes, he'll be with you in just a minute.
Mr. and Mrs. Downing?
- P.J.
- How are you, Eliot?
Helen.
You okay?
We still haven't heard anything.
Well, it only happened yesterday.
The kidnappers are probably as scared as you are.
I don't care what they want.
I'll pay anything.
You've alerted the police.
Detective Casey's good, very good.
- We want you.
- Look...
...she's your daughter.
I can understand your wanting to rely on a private investigator...
...but I simply don't have anyone who can give it the kind of attention it needs.
It's not what I want to hear, Eliot.
There is one possibility.
- Harry Crumb.
- Who's Harry Crumb?
He is one of them.
First, there was Augustus Crumb, who founded the agency.
And then there was his son,
Lionel Crumb...
...perhaps the most brilliant detective of his time.
It was Lionel, God rest his soul, who entrusted me with the day-to-day...
- ...operations of Crumb & Crumb.
- What about Harry Crumb?
He's Lionel's only offspring.
Pure genius.
He's been on special assignment in the Midwest.
I have to pull some strings, but I may be able to convince him.
He's the last in a long line of great detectives.
He's good, huh?
Oh, he's better than good.
He's a Crumb.
Damn.
Think, think, think.
Yeah. Now I've got you.
Help. Help.
Oh, yeah? If you're not cheating on me, whose socks are these?
I've never seen those before.
I get the feeling every time
I walk out that door...
...someone's gonna come in here and take my place.
Sleep in my bed and sit in my chair.
Harry Crumb.
It's for you.
Hi. How you doing?
It's nice to see you.
Nice people, very nice people.
- Morning, Harry.
- Morning, Georgie.
- Any calls yesterday?
- No, Harry.
- How about today?
- Nope.
But you do have a noon appointment with Mrs. MacIntyre.
- Are the photos back?
- On your desk.
- Satin finish?
- Glossies.
- Damn. Noon appointment, huh?
- That's right.
Hold all my calls.
"One who engages in love affairs frivolously or casually."
One who engages in love affairs frivolously or casually.
Yes?
- Yes. Hello? Yes? Yeah? Yes.
- It's Mrs. MacIntyre!
Thank you.
- Send her in.
- Okay, Harry!
Mrs. MacIntyre.
Well, did you or didn't you get the pictures?
Did I get these pictures?
The tough part is not getting the pictures.
The tough part is what you see...
...what you learn about people.
Sad things.
Is that tree diseased?
- What are you talking about?
- There is, Mr. Crumb...
...a lot of money riding on this divorce.
Now, are you gonna show me those pictures or not?
There's some weird things going on in these pictures.
Sick things.
That husband of yours...
...he's quite the philodendron.
- Just give me those pictures.
- Sure.
You idiot.
These pictures are of me.
What?
Let me see those.
Not so fast.
I've had my eye on you for a while, lady.
I knew you were up to something.
Now here's my proof.
It was you having an affair with your husband.
- What?
- I've uncovered some low schemes...
...but hiring me to take pornographic pictures...
...of you and your husband is as low as it gets.
I don't believe this.
Well, believe what you want, but don't believe it here.
You are a poor excuse for a human being.
Says you.
Next.
Boy.
- Crumb & Crumb, serving greater Tulsa.
- Crumb there?
- Yes, he is. Who, may I ask, is calling?
- It's Eliot calling.
One moment, please.
It's the home office.
Yes. Yes.
- Cherry?
- No fruit, thank you.
Coke?
No, thank you.
Mix them together, you got a Cherry Coke.
A Cherry Coke.
Thanks.
What the hell are you doing, you big idiot? Open your eyes!
I see you've been redecorating.
Well, it's been 10 years, Mr. Crumb.
I guess a lot's changed.
Yes and no.
Would you like a mint?
Got them from the bus station.
They're very good.
No, thanks.
Well, I'll show you to your office,
Mr. Crumb.
Good.
- Mr. Crumb?
- Yes?
Mr. Crumb?
Okay, I'm coming.
Mr. Crumb, are you there?
Mr. Crumb?
- Yes?
- Mr. Draisen will see you now.
Exactly.
I really don't think you'll run into any trouble.
Just wanted a second opinion.
- Yes?
- It's Harry Crumb.
- Oh, send him in.
- Crumb?
- You mean...
- That's right, the Harry Crumb.
By the shine of your suit, the cut of your shoes...
...and the look in your eye, you must be Eliot Draisen.
No, I'm Draisen.
Master of disguises, eh?
Good, very good.
Actually, this is Jeffrey Brandt.
He's one of our top men.
Exactly.
Eliot tells me you share my love of languages.
Why don't you just check in with me later, Jeff?
I'll bring Crumb up to speed on the Downing case.
Crumb, do you know what that is?
- An egg?
- Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Well, what kind of egg?
- Bird egg?
- No. No. No. It's a pterodactyl egg.
It's fossilised.
It's 90 million years old.
In the entire world, only two of these have ever been found.
You know, that may be worth something.
- That thought had crossed my mind.
- We think a lot alike.
I like a man who thinks like me.
Did you bring your copy of the Downing file?
No need to.
I've committed it to memory.
At 10:45, on the morning of June 11, it was discovered...
...that Jennifer Downing was abducted from Room 3 at Suki's...
...1225 North Rodeo Drive.
Her assailant chloroformed
Ms. Downing's attendant...
...one Marie Cannell, and it's suspected, did the same to Ms. Downing.
A laundry cart was found in the rear parking lot.
Traces of chloroform were present.
This, no doubt, was their means of escape.
Still one thing puzzles me.
There was not one single mention of the stolen jewels.
There aren't any jewels.
This is a kidnapping.
Just kidding.
I gotta go.
- Hello?
- How's our girl?
Oh, she's nice, Mr. D, real nice.
I had to tell you one thing, Dwayne.
We're in better shape than we thought.
Yeah?
- That guy Crumb I told you about?
- Yeah?
I was right.
The man's a complete and utter idiot.
This is excellent.
This is just plain old-fashioned excellent.
Would you mind taking your free hand off the doorbell?
Sorry. Bit of an accident.
- You Crumb?
- You know who I am.
That's right. Your cover's blown.
- My dad's upstairs.
- So you'd have me believe...
...you're P.J. Downing's daughter, huh?
Impossible.
I happen to know that P.J. Downing's daughter...
...was kidnapped not more than 72 hours ago.
I'm Nikki, the other daughter.
Of course you are.
It's just that I was told...
...that P.J. Downing's daughter was a beautiful young woman...
...so I momentarily mistook her for you.
What a schmooze.
Yes, it is Jennifer Downing
I'm here to find.
And find her...
...I will.
You get paid for this?
- Usually, yeah.
- Mr. Crumb...
...so nice to meet you.
- And you must be...
- Helen Downing.
And then some.
Off to play tennis again?
As you can imagine, these are trying times.
We do what we can to get through them.
But we don't have to enjoy it.
Kids.
Bitch.
I think it's time I see your father now.
Hey, Dad!
Mr. Downing?
Harry Crumb. It's nice to...
Oh, please, sit down.
Continue what you're doing.
Thank you.
Ordinarily, this is one of my great pleasures.
Today, it's just a way to keep my mind off Jennifer.
A sad situation.
Kidnappings always are.
But they are less sad to me...
...because I have yet to meet a kidnapper I could not outwit.
Eliot Draisen says you're the best.
Indeed. He sounds like a smart man.
I'd like to meet him someday.
Didn't he send you here?
Exactly.
- Isn't that a marabou muddler?
- Why, yes, it is.
- Are you a fly-fisherman?
- Fishing is my life.
There's a feeling between man and fish...
...a bond...
...an intimate connection between fish and fisherman.
A special understanding.
You know, the whole fish-man thing.
I was thinking this morning about the kidnappers.
About how much more respect...
...a sportsman has for his quarry.
Exactly.
I'd do anything to get her back.
Money means nothing, Mr. Crumb, when it comes to your own child.
Yes, I met Nikki on the way in.
Nikki? Oh, yes, she's wonderful, but Jennifer was my first little girl.
- Nice fish.
- Thank you.
Very big.
And what have we here? Well....
A real beauty.
You certainly know your bamboo.
Bamboo is my business.
And it's my business to know what no one else wants to know.
That is the very business I'm in.
- You all right, Mr. Crumb?
- Yes, I'm fine.
The girl's mother, how is she holding up?
Oh, she's their stepmother, actually.
We married a couple of years ago in a moment of weakness, perhaps.
She's an attractive woman...
...a very attractive woman, but to tell you the truth, Mr. Crumb...
...she and the girls have never been that close.
- You know how it is.
- Yes.
I know the score of that game:
40-Love.
- Excuse me?
- I was just thinking, Mr. Downing...
...I must become more familiar with these kidnappers.
I must understand them.
I must think like them.
I must go to the scene of the crime.
- Good day to you, sir.
- Good day.
We'll see you then. Bye-bye.
I'm sorry.
What did you say your name was?
I am Deszu Djizlas.
- Could you spell that please?
- I don't think so. Try it with a D.
- You're from New York?
- No, I work in New York.
- I am from Budapest.
- Oh, Hungary.
No, thank you.
I had a falafel before I got here.
I'm sorry, that's not what I meant.
- Mr. D...
- Djizlas.
- I'm Dennis Kimball.
- Dennis Kimball.
Yes. I just heard this morning you were coming.
Yes. Well, I'm here.
- This is our vice president of operations.
- Quality control.
Yes, something that's very important to us here.
So you say.
Move it, Kimball. Come on.
Move, move, move, Dennis.
So, what have we here?
Too tight.
Too loose.
Too foofy.
- You don't like what you see?
- Only I am the judge of that.
- Of course.
- Of course.
The full-body mud pack is one of our most popular treatments.
It tightens the pores and rejuvenates the dermis.
Indulge me. I will be you.
You will be the intruder. Show to me exactly how it happened, please.
Well, he must've been standing here, just in back of me.
And you were applying the mud like so.
He didn't make a sound.
- And you were leaning over like this:
- Yes, that's correct.
And suddenly he leapt out at me.
So it was not as easy as you said.
But you knew what I was doing.
And you... That's funny.
You look different somehow.
Maybe your eyes are playing tricks on me.
Playing tricks on me.
So you always give Miss Downing her mud pack?
- Well, no, it was her first time.
- Oh, really? Really, huh?
Like she doesn't have a regular weekly appointment...
...is that what you're saying?
No, that was her mother, Helen, it was Mrs. Downing's regular time.
Of course.
She had given to her daughter her regular appointment.
I guess she did.
So one could say that Mrs. Downing knew precisely...
...where her daughter would be that day.
A sneaky player.
Very good. Very good. Okay.
- They won't really kill her, will they?
- Of course not.
That's why Mr. Crumb's here.
God.
Great.
I'll see you later.
Helen should know about this.
Tim. Do you know where Mrs. Downing is?
Well, what happens if I do?
That's all right. I'll find her.
Thank you, God.
Thank you, Eliot.
She's probably down by the stables.
Yes, thank you, Eliot.
Good man.
What do you think, Harry?
One size fits all.
Who are they kidding?
- Would you mind?
- No, of course not.
Detective Casey.
I'd like you to meet Harry Crumb.
- I know you by reputation.
- My reputation precedes me.
Otherwise, I'd be late for all my appointments.
Harry Crumb.
You know, Mr. Downing...
...I have a lot of experience in these matters...
...and over the years, I've developed a theory about private detectives.
They're slime, and without exception...
...they are lazy, stupid, cowardly, arrogant...
...and thoroughly incompetent.
It's just a theory.
There it is.
And make sure the lab has the number here...
...in case they come up with anything.
You can have your lab inspect this note as much as you want...
...but they may never discover what I already know.
And what is that, Mr. Crumb?
You find that crazy typewriter, and you'll have your kidnappers.
The ransom note arrived.
They want 10 million.
My God.
They'll suck him dry.
He wants to see you.
- Helen. Listen, I know you're not happy.
- Eliot?
- Oh, my God. Really? Stop it.
- I can make you happy. You know me.
You make me sick.
- Haven't changed since night school.
- I loved you then, and I still do.
I'll tell you what, Eliot.
Back then, dinner and a movie might've gotten you into some girl's panties...
...but it's going to take a lot more than that to get into mine.
What do you want?
Don't you know, Eliot?
Money.
Lots of money.
I'm working on it.
You see, P.J., I believe that there's the criminal body...
...and the criminal mind.
Each are separate from each other in that the criminal body...
...although it's a criminal, doesn't know exactly what it's doing...
...will commit the crime, unwittingly, if you will.
The criminal mind knows exactly what it's doing.
A mind that is brazen, yet cowardly.
Nimble, yet clumsy.
Cunning, yet naive.
- Zealous...
- Would you get to the point?
You first.
It makes me wonder if the criminal mind is actually human at all.
I believe that there's a reason mankind has been lifted...
...beyond the level of the animals.
Human nature is man's greatest triumph...
...but also the source of his undoing.
We all aspire to our noblest instincts...
...and yet, all too often, we indulge our basest desires.
Just like those animals that took our Jennifer.
Yes. They're animals all right.
But have no fear.
The kidnappers will not harm your daughter...
...not while I'm nipping at their heels.
Do you think that these people imagine...
...that they are going to get what they want?
I wonder if it's ever occurred to Mr. Crumb...
...that there may be things going on of which he is totally...
...perhaps blissfully, unaware.
Unfortunately, people don't always do what we expect them to.
Not criminals. Not anyone.
Mr. Draisen.
I don't know what you thought...
...but I would hope you could keep things on a professional level.
- What?
- Please. These things...
...can be so easily misinterpreted.
I think this is a good time for coffee.
Oh, great. Now I suppose everyone will want some.
Oh, jeez, I hope that wasn't as old as it looked.
Sorry.
Hello, Nikki.
You mind if I look around?
Thank you.
It's no wonder they took her, huh?
Do you know that when she was 14 years old...
...she was so skinny that she had everybody worried.
She looked like a newt.
And now, I mean, just look at her.
She's perfect.
Perfect?
Gee, I don't know.
I mean, look at the size of her head.
She must be enormous.
Be easy to find...
...because she's huge.
- Lecithin.
- Lecithin.
Scrod oil.
Crumb.
Scrod oil?
Improves slow-twitch muscle response.
I always thought pancakes were good for that.
Jennifer taught me how to make this.
She tells me that's what gives her that amazing figure.
Your mileage may vary.
You know, it would appear your mother is...
- She's not my mother.
- Okay.
All she wants is Dad's money. Money and sex. She's a nympho, you know.
- Nympho.
- She's gotta have it constantly.
Four or five times a day.
Nympho. Nympho. Nym...
- Nympho.
- That's why she's going out...
...with that scumball, Vince.
What a sleaze.
It would appear that your stepmother presents something of a puzzle to me.
And I thought maybe you'd like to lend a hand.
- Like what, spying?
- No, not like spying.
More like perception or observation or...
- Like spying.
- Like spying, yes.
I just wish they would've kidnapped the old cow instead.
Well, the truth is, Nikki, the kidnappers had a very good reason...
- ...not to take your stepmother.
- What's that?
One cannot kidnap oneself.
I wish we could hear what they were saying.
No need to hear. I've been trained in the art of reading lips.
Every word they say, I see.
Goddamn it, Vince,
I am suffering here.
It's taken me two years to get him to write me into the will.
We spend six months coming up with a plan to kill him...
...and what's it come to? Kidnappers are gonna walk away with the whole thing.
- Don't get so creamed.
- If we don't kill him now...
...he is gonna pay those bastards every penny they want.
There'll be nothing left.
The house, the cars, the stocks.
That's my money.
Our money.
Look, we can get into his car whenever you want.
You wanna do it tonight, we'll do it tonight, okay?
Tonight?
Well, did they do it or not?
They're the kidnappers all right. We've got them right where we want them.
What do you mean? We have no idea where they're keeping Jennifer.
One thing we can be thankful for is...
...that they assigned that idiot Crumb to the case.
You don't think he suspects anything, do you?
No, I think he suspects he has a dick, but he'd need a road map to find it.
Well, I don't mean to be boastful...
...but they're discussing my prowess as a private dick.
Crumb!
Crumb, are you okay?
Don't worry, Nikki.
I've got a firm grip.
Everything will be just fine.
Crumb!
Kid, where you going?
No. No.
Hey.
I thought you said you could do this with your eyes closed.
- Shit.
- What now?
I just paid 34.50 for this shirt, and that's with my pro-shop discount.
Vincent, I hate it when you talk cheap.
Is that it?
No brakes at all?
Better. Pressure's good for regular driving, but once they hit the hills:
No more Freddy the Fisherman.
You bet.
Stop.
I like you dirty.
Yeah.
Say something sexy, you animal.
Gotta check in with the mister.
He cares about you almost as much as I do.
- Hello?
- How we doing, boss man?
Fine. Getting along
with your house guest?
Oh, yeah.
She's a little shy, but I can tell she likes me.
You'll get your chance.
Control yourself till the cheque's in the mail, so to speak.
- Damn it, Draisen, you said...
- Dwayne, you'll get what you want...
...when I get what I want, understood?
- All right, I'll put my magic on hold.
- Sorry, sorry.
Yeah. Just stay there till Dobson gets there. Right.
I have identified the kidnapper.
- Do tell.
- Brace yourself, Eliot.
You may find this very hard to believe...
...but the kidnapper is none other than...
...Helen Downing.
That does come as a surprise to me.
I thought it would.
But that is why you hired me in the first place, isn't it?
You're right about that.
You wanna hear some more?
Helen Downing is having an affair.
She what?
She's doing the bad thing with Vince Barnes...
...that two-bit country-club Romeo.
Our little Helen is not only a kidnapper...
...she's a slut.
I thought you'd find that funny.
Oh, God. From now on,
I'm gonna keep a close eye...
...on our Mrs. Downing and that strapping stud of hers.
You really are incredible, Crumb.
I mean, just the way that you handle yourself.
God forbid anything dangerous should happen.
Dangerous?
Dangerous? Eliot, I've got a black belt in aikido and the boots to match.
Touchdown.
We'll be taking the canyon drive today, Mr. Downing?
Yes, I can't stand this waiting around,
Henry, sitting in the house.
I thought, perhaps, a drive alone might help.
Let's go.
I think it'd be better if I'm not here.
Nice car.
I don't believe it.
A 1936 supercharged
Auburn 851 Speedster...
...with Lycoming double overhead cams, and in cherry condition.
You're certainly a font of knowledge,
Mr. Crumb.
I'm fond of many things,
Mr. Downing.
And one of them is keeping an eye on my quarry.
I can just see him now, hanging on to that wheel...
...listening to Mozart, heading down that canyon.
He's gonna die a happy man.
The whole trick to tailing a suspect is anticipation.
Anticipation, perseverance and inconspicuousness.
You make this stuff up as you go along?
Not at all.
I've been so thoroughly trained...
...I don't even have to think before I speak.
So tell me, what's it like, I mean, you know, being a great detective and all?
Well, my modesty prohibits me saying.
However, I can tell you what it's like coming from a long line of detectives.
It was a very, very, very...
...big pain in the butt, that's what it was.
- Oh, same old family crap, huh?
- Yeah. You know, Nikki...
...I'm not like those other Crumbs.
I'm my own Crumb.
You know what I mean?
But it's different with Jennifer.
I mean, she's so good at everything, and she's so beautiful.
Not that I'm jealous or anything.
Perhaps Jennifer should be the jealous one.
I have this feeling.
- You mean that he's dead?
- Do you think so?
To tell you the truth...
...there's a way in which you and I are very much alike.
We're both travelling through life...
...in a car with no brakes.
Crumb.
Oh, no.
No.
Hey, watch it!
- My God.
- It's Crumb.
- For chrissake, can't you lose him?
- This guy's on me like glue.
Hey, what happened to inconspicuous?
Not now, my little health shake.
He's good, really good.
Can't you control this thing?
Let's see. "Runaway vehicle.
Step number one: Remain calm.
Step number two: Feather the brakes with a light pumping motion."
That makes sense.
- Holy shit, that was dangerous.
- Danger?
Danger's my middle name.
I'm sure of it, Nikki.
It was no accident.
The brakes on your father's car were deliberately tampered with.
The one thing that puzzles me is how the kidnappers knew...
...that I would be driving P.J.'s car.
That Vince Barnes, he's craftier than I thought.
Oh, come on, Harry, he's an idiot.
A book cover is only skin-deep.
Sometimes you have to read every word to get the whole picture.
I think it's time we paid
Mr. Vince Barnes a little visit.
Mr. Crumb, I have news.
My mechanic says the brake fluid was deliberately drained.
Harry already figured that out, Dad.
The kidnappers have made one fatal mistake.
- What's that, Mr. Crumb?
- They're making me mad.
Dad, we're gonna set up a surveillance operation.
I'm sure Mr. Crumb doesn't need you interfering with his work.
On the contrary, P.J.,
Nikki's been invaluable to me.
I'm sure she means to be helpful, but...
No "buts" about it.
Nikki has given me information...
...I couldn't have gotten on my own.
You shouldn't underestimate her.
Yes. Well, I'll take that into consideration.
You're an insightful man, Mr. Crumb.
A man of many talents.
It's a burden, yes, but one that I can live with.
Oh, there we are.
There we are right here.
Good, good, good.
Vince Barnes. Vince Barnes.
Vince Barnes, number nine.
Good, good, good.
Very good.
That is very good to know.
Very good. Oh, no.
Right, right.
Combination, combination.
That's it. Left, right, left, right.
Come on, throw him, throw him, throw him.
Oh, boy. A thousand apologies for my face hitting your fisticuffs, sahib.
- Who are you?
- I am Vijay. Vijay from Bombay.
Bombay Air Conditioning.
Let me present you with my card.
When the going gets hot, the hot get air conditioning.
- It's a cute slogan, wouldn't you say?
- Beat it.
Perhaps later.
Now I will fix your air conditioning.
- Now listen, Tonto.
- Tonto?
I don't know if you speak American, but I'm just gonna say this once:
Nobody told me nothing about no air-conditioning repair.
I don't know anything about that.
But what I do know is this:
That the people of this building are very, very hot right now.
They are sweaty and disgusting.
They are all blaming you.
- Me?
- Oh, yes.
I've even heard them say they're talking about your dismissal.
Well, what are you standing around for? Get.
- Come on, get your butt up there.
- All right, I'm moving.
I still don't understand why Crumb was in that car.
- P.J. should've been dead by now.
- Shut up.
Just think of another way to kill him and pour me a drink.
I got it.
Look, Vince's apartment is right here...
...and the ventilator shaft runs right alongside of it.
Right.
- Hello?
- Hello, Mr. Barnes.
- Yeah?
- You're late.
- What?
- Tennis lesson.
- You mean right now?
- That's right. I'm waiting.
Okay.
Who was that?
- It's the club. I got a lesson.
- Now?
Hey, babe, I'll be back in an hour.
Just like a doctor, always on call.
God help us.
How you doing, Harry?
The things I do for money.
Okay, listen, you're almost there.
About another 15 feet up on your left.
It's not too far.
That's easy for you to say.
What's the matter, big boy?
Just couldn't stay away?
Eliot.
What the hell are you doing here?
I might ask you the same thing.
Classy.
- You can't just barge in here.
- Better me than your husband.
Number 9. I'm here.
Damn. The vent's too high.
I can barely see.
This is very low, blackmailing me for sexual favours.
But what the hell.
Just give me a minute.
Hell, in our own hacienda.
With servants?
Servants and seascapes
and champagne wishes.
And caviar dreams.
With my brains and your brown eyes,
we're going places. Big places.
We'll get the loot, go to the airport.
Got tickets booked under a false name.
- There's no coming back.
- This is great.
They're giving away everything.
Yeah, it's like taking candy from a baby.
- But what about the girl?
- Forget the girl.
We don't need her anymore.
Not where we're going.
- You mean...
- That's right, baby. Buenos Aires.
- Buenos Aires.
- Buenos Aires, is it?
- Great.
- You sure you can handle it?
I can handle it.
I can handle anything.
Helen? Helen?
If I were rich, would you think differently of me?
What kind of girl do you think I am?
Of course I would.
Good.
Hold me. Touch me.
Kiss me, you mad fool.
You make me feel
like a woman again.
What is going on in there?
I don't know.
Sounds like things are getting mushy.
- Stop. Stop.
- What?
- It's too hot.
- What?
Turn on the air conditioner.
It's too hot.
I can't wait, my darling.
I get the feeling like there ain't nobody
in this crazy, mixed-up world...
...who can stop us now. No one.
It's just dribbling out.
It's a little nippy in here.
- What kind of cheap place is this?
- Well, it's happening right now.
Eliot. It's probably just clogged.
Just put it on exhaust.
What a piece of junk.
What the...?
Stick him. Move. That's it.
Up, down, up...
All right. My lucky day.
Move. Sucker punch. Sucker punch!
More coins!
All right, come on. Come to Daddy.
Come on. Jackpot!
And Kelly is the winner
at 1:29 in the 11th round.
Tom "The Maniac" Kelly....
Shit.
Vince, you are not listening.
They want the money on Friday.
- Friday.
- This Friday.
I can buy us a little time, but we have to kill him this weekend.
Helen, you don't understand.
If they don't get their money
on Friday, they might kill her.
Don't be such a putz, Vince.
You make an omelette, you break a few eggs.
Just be there tonight, you big hunk of meat.
Eliot, I have something to show you.
- You do?
- Yes.
As a result of my clandestine photo operation...
...I have photographic prints showing Helen Downing...
...and Vince Barnes in the midst of their humping activity.
- And you want me to see them?
- Of course.
I'm always interested in your professional opinion.
Say, is that a dog?
Why don't we just discuss this in your office?
As you wish.
Come on in, Eliot.
Make yourself to home.
I took these yesterday.
I had the lab put a rush on them.
Go ahead. Have a look-see.
You were photographing
Vince Barnes' apartment yesterday?
Exactly.
You haven't looked at these, have you?
No. I was there.
I mean, you'd think an athletic guy like Vince Barnes...
...would have a big dingus, you know?
But no, take a look at that pathetic little...
...fallacy.
You don't know anything about this kidnapping.
Quite the contrary, Eliot.
The kidnappers are so unnerved by my presence...
...they've had to change their plans midstream.
What are you talking about?
See for yourself.
They had to push back the ransom drop from Friday till Monday.
- No, no. This is wrong.
- No, it's perfect.
Perfect.
I believe, Eliot...
...in fact, I know, that at this very moment...
...the kidnappers are in pain, mental torment...
...trying to figure out my next move.
There's only one thing
I don't know, Eliot.
What this lever does.
I don't know. Maybe it's a brake.
Come on, Eliot. What kind of stationary bike has a brake?
You know, Eliot, you were right.
That was a brake.
Go figure, huh?
All there.
All there.
- One short.
- Oh, please.
I hope you're not actually paying this clown for his so-called services.
"So-called"?
See for yourself, butch.
Ninety-five, 96, 97, 98....
- Ninety-nine.
- Amazing.
Tim.
All right.
Right on time. Eliot.
- Hello.
- This is Jennifer.
They want the money today.
- Today instead of Monday?
- That's right.
Put the money in a suitcase
and go to the racetrack at noon...
...then wait by the phone
next to the jockeys' entrance.
And no police...
...or they'll kill me.
Okay, Jennifer. Just relax.
Everything's gonna be fi...
Jennifer? Jennifer?
Jennifer.
- Too short to get a trace.
- Exactly.
Very nice.
I'd say you got at least a fifty-fifty chance of living.
And good news...
...we're going to the airport.
As long as we keep track of the money...
...we know where the kidnappers are.
This gives us a range of up to three miles.
There is no way they'll be aware of police presence.
Sounds peachy.
Mr. Crumb?
Sounds okay to me.
As long as the police stay completely out of sight...
...and out of my way.
When this is all over, Crumb...
...I'm gonna rip your heart out and eat it for breakfast.
Take a number.
- Hello?
- Vince.
- Yeah, babe.
- We've got a problem.
Hello, Susie? My name is Angel.
I'm a friend of Miguel.
- Hello?
- Crumb?
- Yes?
- Give the money to Draisen.
Pardon?
Give the money to Eliot Draisen.
- Who?
- Eliot Draisen.
- Eliot Draisen?
- Give him the money.
You want me to give the money
to Eliot Draisen?
Hello? Hello? Kidnapper?
I can barely here you. Hello, man.
Speak up, for God's sake.
Use your voice. Hello?
We have a faulty connection.
I'm on a jockey phone.
- I'm on the phone.
- Crumb.
- Eliot?
- I'm on the phone with the kidnappers.
I guess I'm supposed to take it from here.
So, yeah, just help me, okay?
That's my pants. All right.
- Hold there. Wait a minute.
- Crumb.
- Yeah?
- Breathe in.
Eliot.
Bye, Harry Crumb.
- What now?
- Who said that?
It's Nikki.
I thought you might need me.
- What do we do now?
- Now we sit tight.
There's no point in following their path, because we know where they're going.
The flight to Buenos Aires doesn't leave till 4:00.
We've got all the time in the world.
And I think we're gonna need it.
I think I'm stuck.
I know I'm stuck.
Let's go.
Shit. What the hell was that?
- You're losing him.
- He's right there.
Will you let me handle it?
We gotta get the money...
- ...before the kidnappers do.
- Vin, just get it.
What do you think he's doing?
Do I look like Mr. Frigging Wizard?
He's doing whatever the hell the kidnappers told him to do.
You idiot.
One, two, three.
Now announcing the arrival
of Flight 50 from New York...
...arriving at Gate 88.
Now announcing the arrival
of Flight 50 from New York...
...arriving at Gate 88.
I hate being poor.
Well, we've still got each other, babe.
- Yeah?
- Hello. Helen?
Who is this?
What the hell do you want, Eliot?
You what?
You kidnapped her?
Buenos Aires?
Well, of course I'm coming.
I'm out the door, you cute little man.
This jacket's too tight. It was those motel dry cleaners, they shrunk it.
Yeah, right. Says you.
Eliot?
Helen.
Is that the money?
Ten million?
You know, Eliot, I have a little confession of my own to make.
What?
I'm the one who changed the ransom note.
You?
Well, I've been trying to kill P.J.
You know, for his money.
I guess we're just two of a kind.
We're made for each other.
You shouldn't talk so loud on the phone, Helen.
Give me the suitcase, pal.
Nice and slow.
Final boarding call for Flight 736
to Reno.
Thank God you're here.
I've been so worried.
Can you believe this man almost got away with our money?
I don't know, Helen.
I don't think I can trust you anymore.
Oh, Vincent.
Vinny.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
No! No!
In there.
I don't think you'll be needing those.
Hit it.
The bag, the bag.
- Flight 212 to Buenos Aires, Gate 17.
- Right.
Step back please, sir.
Flight 212 to Buenos Aires
is now boarding.
Flight 212 to Buenos Aires
now boarding Gate 17.
Should be getting a call any minute now.
You gonna miss me?
Metal plate in my head.
I forgot. It's a scooter accident when I was a kid.
Metal plate.
It doesn't hurt.
All right.
Come on.
Nikki! Nikki! Take it down, Nikki!
Take it down!
I can't get this thing down!
Nikki, turn!
Crumb, are you okay?
Of course I'm okay!
Nik! Nikki!
We're currently number three for takeoff.
We'll be receiving takeoff clearance momentarily.
You there! Pilot!
- Stop!
- We'll be cruising at 32,000 feet.
What the fuck is that?
Nikki. Nikki. Nikki, turn!
Who is that?
Crumb. Harry Crumb.
And I hereby charge these two miscreants...
...with the kidnapping of one Jennifer Downing.
You must be crazy, Crumb.
Crazy? Crazy like a fox.
I must warn you, Vince Barnes,
I have a black belt in aikido.
For chrissake, just shoot him.
And the boots to match.
Thank you, Mr. Crumb.
Nikki says we owe everything to you.
Oh, please. I had a good partner.
Didn't I tell you he was a schmooze?
If it's all right, Miss Downing, we'd like to ask you...
- ...a few more questions.
- Sure. Whatever.
Hey.
Well, well, well. Detective Casey.
What about your theory now?
What can I say, Mr. Crumb?
What can you say?
I'll tell you what you can say.
- You can say that you're a...
- Harry.
It's just a thought, that's all, a theory.
Don't make a sound.
Eliot.
Don't think I didn't know what was going on in your mind.
You didn't think I could figure it out, did you, Eliot?
You didn't think
I was up to the challenge.
Now you understand.
Now you know how good I really am.
Yup. Now you know the folly of your ways.
Maybe now, in front of these two gentlemen...
...you'll finally be man enough to give credit...
...where credit is due.
What do you say to that,
Eliot Draisen?
All right, you imbecile, I confess.
I did it!
I kidnapped her!
I was behind the whole thing!
I don't know how you figured it out with that witless brain of yours...
...but I would rather rot in jail for the rest of my life...
...rather than listen to one more idiotic word!
Book him.
I'm forever in your debt, Harry.
I don't know how I can ever repay you.
You kind words are enough, P.J., not to mention this enormous cheque.
You earned it, Harry.
You've given me back my daughter.
Both my daughters.
Harry, are you sure you won't come with us to Hawaii?
You'd look great in a grass skirt.
Thanks, Nikki, but a president must be on call 24 hours a day.
Okay.
- Goodbye, Crumb.
- Goodbye, Nikki.
- P.J.
- Remember, lunch, soon as I get back.
You got it. Have a safe trip.
- Okay.
- Say hi to Don Ho for me.
Excuse me, Mr. Crumb. These escrow papers are ready for your signature.
Not quite. Call the bank, we wanna refinance at 8 percent.
I need to set a date for the stockholders meeting.
Set it for the 12th.
These are you drapes for the boardroom, Mr. Crumb.
- No. Go with Venetian blinds.
- Like I suggested in the first place.
Not now. Not now. That's enough.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Harry! San Francisco's calling on line two!
All right.
- Hello?
- Mr. Crumb?
- Hey.
- Harry Crumb?
Yes. Yes, this is Crumb.
- You ever been to San Francisco?
- Yes, I've been to San Francisco.
- The Bottoms Up Club?
- The Bottoms Up Club?
- Yes, I've heard of that club. That's...
- You've been here?
- No, I've never been there.
- There's been a murder.
- A murder?
- Yes. Can you come?
- Yes.
- Right away?
- Yes. Consider me there.
- Good.
Good luck, Harry.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna need it.
Looks like this one could get a little rough.
Agnes!
I'm just gonna put something here to stop the bleeding.
Excuse me, Sister. She'll be fine.
Here they are now.
One question:
Are you guilty?
Are you guilty?
- Martha, it's you.
- What about Roger? He's free.
They want a woman.
All you have to do is meet with her and tell the court she's insane.
Are you dictating my position?
This is sticky territory.
Nobody wants this case to go to trial.
Not the Church, the Crown, least of all me.
- Eve, she strangled a baby.
- Nobody wants to send a nun to prison.
We're not telling you what to decide, or even to take it.
Is there any reason why you feel you shouldn't take it?
Today's my birthday.
I always make bad decisions on my birthday.
Happy birthday.
Hi, kitty.
It's Helen. Mrs. Davenport confirmed
her appointment at 9:00 tomorrow.
Okay? Bye-bye.
Wait a minute.
- Yeah.
- It's Roger. Call me at the hospital.
I'd like your opinion on a case.
And happy birthday.
Helen again. I cancelled
your Wednesday appointment...
... so you can visit your mother.
Bye-bye.
Hello, Martha. Guess who?
Bonjour. I'm Dr. Martha Livingston.
Hello. I'm...
...Dr. Martha Livingston.
I...
Excuse me.
I'm a...
...court-appointed psychiatrist.
Thank you.
I believe your Mother Superior's expecting me?
Dr. Livingston, I presume?
I'm Mother Miriam Ruth.
You needn't call me "Mother."
Most find it uncomfortable.
I'm afraid it brings up unpleasant connotations.
- So you can call me "Sister."
- Thank you.
You must have tons of questions.
You may smoke.
Just don't tell any of the sisters.
They wouldn't understand.
Especially Marguerite.
She'd scare the pants off
Queen Elizabeth.
Besides, I miss them.
- You smoked?
- Two packs a day.
I can beat that.
Unfiltered.
Well, you have questions.
Fire away.
- Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
- No one.
- She hid it?
- She undressed and bathed alone.
- Is that normal?
- Yes.
- And during the day?
- She could've hidden a machine gun.
Did she have any physical exams?
Once a year.
Her pregnancy fell between the visits.
- Who is the father?
- I haven't a clue.
- What men had access to her?
- None, as far as I know.
- A priest?
- Yes, but...
- His name?
- Father Martineau.
- I don't see him as a candidate.
- Was there anyone else?
Obviously, there was.
- You didn't find out who?
- I've done everything but ask Agnes.
- Why haven't you?
- She can't even remember the birth.
- Somebody gave her the baby.
- Yes, 10 months ago.
I fail to see how that somebody has anything to do with this trial.
Why do you think that?
Don't ask me questions.
I'm not the patient.
Well, I'm the doctor.
I'm the one who will decide what is or is not important.
I don't know how to tell you this, but I don't approve of you.
- Not personally...
- Psychiatry.
Exactly. I want you to deal with her speedily and easily.
She won't hold under cross-examination.
- I'm not the Inquisition.
- I'm not from the Middle Ages.
I know what you are.
I don't want that mind cut open.
Hello.
I'm Dr. Livingston.
I've been asked to talk to you. May I?
Yes.
You have a lovely voice.
No, I don't.
I just heard you.
That wasn't me.
Was it Sister Marguerite?
You're very pretty, Agnes.
No, I'm not.
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
Let's talk about something else.
- What should we talk about?
- I don't know.
- Anything. May I sit down?
- Yes.
The first thing that comes to your mind.
God. But there's nothing to say about God.
- Second thing that comes to mind?
- Love.
- Have you ever loved anyone?
- Yes.
- Who?
- Everyone.
- Who in particular?
- Right now?
I love you.
Have you ever loved another man?
Other than Jesus Christ?
- Yes.
- Who?
There are so many.
- Well, do you love Father Martineau?
- Oh, yes.
- You think he loves you?
- I know he does.
- He's told you?
- No, but...
...when I look into his eyes,
I can see.
- You've been alone together?
- Yes.
- Often?
- At least once a week.
- And you like that?
- Oh, yes.
- Where do you meet?
- In the confessional.
- Do you ever see him outside...?
- You want to talk about the baby?
- Would you like to?
- I never saw a baby. They made it up.
- Why should they?
- I don't know.
- Do you remember the night?
- No, I was sick.
- How?
- Something I ate.
- Did it hurt?
- Yes.
Where?
Down there.
- What did you do?
- I went to my room.
- What happened there?
- I got sicker.
- And then what?
- I fell asleep.
- In the middle of all the pain?
- Yes.
- Where did the baby come from?
- What baby?
- The one they made up.
- Their heads.
- That's where they say?
- No, the wastebasket.
- Where was it from before?
- From God.
- After God, before the wastebasket.
- I don't understand.
- How are babies born?
- Don't you know?
Yes, I do, but I want you to...
I don't understand! You want to talk about the baby, everybody does.
But...
...I never saw the baby, so I can't talk about it...
...because I don't believe in it.
- Let's talk about something else.
- I'm tired of talking.
Nobody believes me when I tell them.
Nobody listens to me.
I don't want to answer questions.
Would you like to ask them?
- What do you mean?
- You ask and I'll answer.
Anything?
Anything.
What's your real name?
- Martha Louise Livingston.
- Married?
- No.
- Would you like to be?
- Not at the moment.
- Do you have children?
- Would you like some?
- I can't have them.
Why not?
I've stopped menstruating.
Why do you smoke?
- Does it bother you?
- No questions.
Smoking is an obsession with me.
Maybe I'll become obsessed with something else and I'll stop smoking.
- Do you have any more questions?
- One.
- What?
- Where do you think babies come from?
From their mothers and fathers, of course.
Before that, I don't know.
I think they come when an angel...
...lights on their mother's chest and whispers to her.
That makes a good baby start to grow.
Bad babies come when a fallen angel squeezes in down there...
...and they grow, and grow...
...until they come out down there.
I don't know where good babies come out.
And you can't tell the difference.
Except bad babies cry a lot.
And they make their fathers go away.
And their mothers get very ill.
Die sometimes.
Mommy wasn't very happy when she died.
I think she went to hell, because every time I see her...
...she looks like she stepped out of a hot shower.
And I'm never sure if it's her...
...or the lady who tells me things.
They fight over me all the time.
The lady...
...I saw when I was 10.
I was lying on the grass, looking at the sun.
The sun became a cloud...
...and the cloud became...
...the lady.
And she told me she would talk to me.
Then her feet began to bleed.
And I saw there were holes in her hand and in her side.
And I tried to catch the blood as it fell from the sky...
...but I couldn't see because my eyes hurt...
...because there were black spots in front of them.
And she tells me things. Like...
...right now she's crying,
"Marie! Marie!"
But I don't know what that means.
She uses me to sing.
It's as if she's throwing a hook...
...and it catches under my ribs and tries to pull me up.
But I can't move.
Mommy's holding my feet.
All I can do is sing in her voice!
It's the lady's voice!
God loves you!
God loves you!
God loves you.
- Do you know a Marie?
- No.
Do you?
Why should I?
I don't know.
Well, what do you think?
Totally bananas or slightly off-center?
Or maybe perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
What's your opinion?
- I believe Agnes is different.
- From other nuns? I've noticed.
From other people.
I believe that she's not crazy nor lying.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
She's an innocent. She's a slate that hasn't been touched except by God.
Ridiculous.
Not in her case.
She's had little school.
Her mother kept her home.
When she died, Agnes came to us.
She's never been out there.
She's never seen a movie or TV.
- Never even read a book.
- Then why did she murder a child?
It's manslaughter, not murder.
She didn't consciously kill it.
She lost a lot of blood.
She was unconscious.
- Someone else could've done it.
- Not in the eyes of the police.
- And in your eyes?
- I've told you.
She was unconscious.
Someone easily could've...
- You honestly believe that?
- It's possible, isn't it?
Who?
Another nun found out and wanted to avoid a scandal.
That's absurd.
- The possibility never occurred to you?
- No one knew about Agnes' pregnancy.
Not even Agnes.
You've been listening to
"Mostly Music."
This is CBC radio.
Is Father Martineau in, please?
Wipe your feet.
They rise at 5 in the morning.
Please.
And they're in bed...
...by 9:00 at night.
Even if a man could get to them...
...he would probably find them praying.
That's why I say that the real question...
...is not only how he got in, but when.
And you're the only man to see them?
I promise you, doctor...
...even if I had the inclination...
...how could I possibly catch her?
She would have to be a very slow...
...and patient nun.
They're a very special and rare people...
...those sisters.
Only a few of them left in this modern world...
...consecrated to the praise of God.
That's why we were chosen
by the president himself!
The president?
Come on, lizard brain,
can't you tell it's really us?
Hello, Mama.
- Brought you something.
- Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
It's your favourite.
Who are you?
It's Martha, Mama.
Here you go.
Marie brings me ice cream too, you know.
Chocolate. My favorite.
I thought cherry vanilla was.
Not anymore. Now I like chocolate.
- Are they treating you all right?
- Martha never comes to see me.
Watch, she's going to hell.
After the things she's said to me.
Then she marries this son-of-a-bitch
Frenchman, has an abortion.
I knew that one wouldn't work out.
Not like you, Marie.
You got married to God.
Marie's dead, Mama.
When you was little, Marie, you'd come back from the movies and say:
"Mama, that ending was so sad."
I'd tell you they had the happy endings in a vault in Hollywood.
And you believed me.
Mama...
...that wasn't Marie, that was me.
Who are you?
I'm Martha, Mama.
The convent was built for over 50.
Not many of us left.
- Us and the chickens.
- How do you survive?
We own the land, but we rent it out.
We keep a few acres.
Some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
That's a lot of land.
You have field hands?
No, we work the land alone.
Only Sister Marguerite and I are permitted public contact.
Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
That one there, in the corner.
- The one up on the third floor?
- Yes.
This convent is locked solid.
Only Marguerite has a key.
She wouldn't let Christ in after dark.
It happens in the day too.
Maybe Agnes went to him.
She doesn't know how babies are born, let alone made.
When did you first learn about...
...her innocence?
The way she thinks.
- When she came to us.
- You weren't shocked?
I was appalled. Just as you are.
- What happened?
- She stopped eating completely.
- This was before her pregnancy?
- About two years before.
Agnes, it has come to my attention that you've stopped eating.
- Why is this?
- I've been commanded by God.
- He talked to you himself?
- No.
- Through someone else?
- Yes.
- Who?
- I can't say.
- Why?
- She'd punish me.
- One of the sisters?
- No.
Who?
Why would she tell you to do this?
Look at me.
- Because I'm getting fat.
- Oh, for heaven's sakes.
There's too much flesh on me.
I'm a blimp.
You needn't worry about being attractive here.
I have to be attractive to God.
- He loves you.
- No, he hates fat people.
- It's a sin to be fat.
- Why?
- Look at the statues. They're thin.
- Agnes.
They're suffering. It's beautiful.
I want to be beautiful.
Who tells you this?
Christ said,
"Suffer the little children."
- I want to suffer like a little child.
- That's not what he meant.
My body keeps getting bigger.
Soon I won't be able to squeeze into heaven.
- Heaven is not a place with bars...
- Look at these! I'm a blimp!
Oh, my dear child.
God blew up the Hindenburg.
He'll blow me up, she said.
- Who?
- Mommy. I'll get bigger until I pop.
But if I stay little, it won't happen.
Your mother tells you this?
Agnes, your mother is dead.
- She watches, she listens.
- Nonsense. I'm your mother now. Eat.
- I'm not hungry.
- You've got to eat something.
No, I don't.
The host is enough.
A wafer doesn't have enough daily allowance of anything.
Of God.
Yes. Of God.
I'm being punished.
- Why?
- I don't know.
Dear Jesus!
It started this morning.
I can't stop it.
- Why didn't you send her to a doctor?
- It healed the next day...
She had a hole in her hand!
What if she bled to death?
But she didn't, did she?
If anyone had seen what I'd seen, she'd be ridiculed.
- She doesn't deserve it.
- She has it now.
You think she's a hysteric, pure and simple.
- Not simple, no.
- I saw it.
Clean through her palm.
Can hysteria do that?
It's been doing it for centuries.
She's not unique.
- She's just another victim.
- God's victim.
That's her innocence.
She belongs to God.
And I intend to take her away from him.
It's what you're afraid of, isn't it?
You bet I am.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Here they are.
Don't let anyone know where you got them.
Thanks.
Last Tuesday, I didn't eat all of my lima beans...
...but hid them under my spoon.
- Yes.
I had ugly thoughts about
Sister Marguerite.
Speak up.
I can hardly hear you.
I thought ugly thoughts about Sister Marguerite!
Why the hell is this
taking so long?
There are many unanswered questions.
Your job is to diagnose, not to play detective.
Don't tell me my job, Lyon.
My duty as a doctor is...
You must make a decision as quickly as possible, and not interfere with...
As quickly as I see fit.
The longer you take, the more difficult it'll be for us.
Why?
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
The sooner she's in prison, the better!
- I don't bloody believe this!
- Well, the bishop will be very upset...
I'm fighting for this woman's life!
Not some bloody bishop!
You liked Sister Paul?
She was kind to me.
She told me I was beautiful.
What else did she tell you?
She said all the angels would want to sleep beside me if they could.
I liked that.
She lived here for almost 70 years.
Every day she'd ring the bell, wake us up...
...call us to God.
She took me to my secret place.
Where's that?
I promise I won't tell.
Would you take me?
Sister Paul was in her 80s?
- Did she come here often?
- Only when she felt like it.
She brought me up here last winter, and the next day she died.
No wonder. Wait.
- Agnes?
- What?
Agnes, how do you feel about babies?
They frighten me.
I'm afraid I'll drop them.
They have a soft spot, and if you drop them, they become stupid.
- That's why I don't understand things.
- Like what?
Numbers. You can count and never reach the end.
I don't understand them either.
Think I was dropped on my head?
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
Oh, I gotta give up smoking.
Agnes? Wait a minute.
Agnes, slow down.
She said you could see the whole world from up here.
That it looks much better far away than it does close-up.
- Beautiful.
- And sometimes, I get under here.
It makes a wonderful sound.
- What happens if the bell rings?
- It's even more wonderful then.
It's like hiding from my mother as a girl.
- Where did you go?
- No place as wonderful as this.
Have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?
No.
There is nothing else.
Being here at night helps me sleep.
- You have trouble sleeping?
- I get headaches.
Mommy did too.
Oh, but she wasn't stupid.
She knew things nobody else knew.
What things?
She knew what was going to happen to me. So she hid me.
- How did she know?
- Somebody told her.
- Who?
- I don't know.
Agnes.
You'll laugh.
I promise I won't laugh.
Who told her?
An angel during one of her headaches.
- Did she see angels often?
- No.
- Do you?
- No.
Do you believe she really saw them?
- No. But I could never tell her that.
- Why not?
She'd get angry.
Agnes, did you love your mother?
- Yes.
- Did you ever want to be a mother?
- I could never be a mother.
- Why not?
I'm not old enough, and I don't want to have a baby.
Why not?
Because I don't want one.
- If you did, how would you get one?
- From someone who didn't want a baby.
- Like you?
- No, not like me.
How would they get one?
- A mistake.
- Agnes.
- Your mother...
- It was a mistake.
- That's what she said?
- You want me to say she was bad...
...but she was a saint!
- You know nothing about sex?
- I'm stupid.
You don't remember getting pregnant or carrying a child?
- It was a mistake!
- A child?
Everything! Nuns don't have children!
Don't touch me like that!
I know what you want from me.
You want to take God away.
You should be ashamed. They should lock you up, people like you!
Don't let her take me away.
- You hate us, don't you?
- What?
Nuns. You hate nuns.
- I hate stupidity.
- And the Church.
- I haven't said...
- The Church isn't on trial.
Deal with her without prejudice or leave the case.
- This is my affair!
- And mine.
- How dare you try to bully me?!
- I only want you to be fair.
You expect applause for the way you've treated this child?
She's not a child.
She should know the world is filled with people who don't believe in God.
People who've never bent their knees once, to anybody!
People who fall in love and have babies, and are happy!
She has a right to know that, but the Church has kept her ignorant.
Ignorance is next to virginity!
Poverty, chastity and ignorance!
I'm not a virgin, doctor.
I was married for 23 years.
I even have grandchildren. I was a failure as a wife and a mother.
My children won't even see me anymore.
They tell their friends that I'm dead.
I'm not making up for past mistakes,
Dr. Freud!
- Then help her.
- I am.
Let her face the world.
Why? It's either prison or a nut house and the differences are pretty thin!
- There's another choice.
- What?
- Acquittal.
- How?
Legal innocence.
I know the judge wants any reason to throw this case out of court.
- What do you need?
- Answers.
When would Agnes have conceived the child?
Sometime in January.
Remember anything unusual happening at the time?
Earthquakes.
- Visitors to the convent?
- Nothing.
- Do you have a daybook?
- Yes.
- Take a look at it.
- There's nothing here.
Was it full-term?
- Oh, dear God.
- What is it?
- The sheets.
- What sheets?
Oh, dear God. I should have guessed.
I should have suspected something.
Marguerite says you've been sleeping on a bare mattress. True?
- Yes, Mother.
- Why?
In the medieval days, nuns and monks slept in coffins.
- It's not the Middle Ages.
- It made them holy.
It made them uncomfortable.
The next day they were cranky as mules.
Sister, where are your sheets?
Do you think a bare mattress is like a coffin?
No.
Then tell me, where are your sheets?
- I burned them.
- Why?
They were stained.
How many times have I told you and your fellow novice...
...that menstruation is natural and not to be ashamed of?
- Yes, Mother.
- Say it.
It is a natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
- Mean it.
- It is a perfectly natural...
Years ago, one of the sisters came to me in tears, seeking comfort...
...because she was too old to have children. Not that she wanted to.
But once a month she'd been reminded of the possibility of motherhood.
Dry your eyes, Sister, and thank God for that possibility.
It's not that, it's not that.
- What do you mean?
- It's not my time of month.
- Should you see a doctor?
- I don't know what happened.
There was blood on the sheets, but I don't know why.
I don't know what I did wrong.
I don't know why I should be punished.
- For what?
- I don't know, I don't know.
That was the beginning,
the night of the conception.
When was that?
The 23rd of January.
One of our elder nuns passed.
- Sister Paul?
- Yes.
I don't know where Agnes was.
I was needed in the sickroom.
His Excellence expresses his
gratitude for the care you're taking.
- She shouldn't return to the convent?
- No.
You're probably right.
It can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continue.
I never called it an investigation.
Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherine's.
- What does...?
- Your sister died in a convent.
- Who told you this?
- Do you still go to church?
- What business...?
- We wonder if you can be objective.
Look, just because I don't subscribe to your beliefs...
Your beliefs make no difference to us whatsoever.
But they do to Agnes.
- You expect me to just condemn her?
- Someone's got to suffer for this.
You've got to be merciful and quick.
Excuse me.
Agnes, I want to help you.
- I'm not sick.
- You're troubled, aren't you?
Because you keep reminding me.
Let me forget.
- You're unhappy.
- Everyone is, aren't you?
- Agnes...
- You never answer me.
Sometimes, yes.
Your mother never said things to you or did things to you.
- But that was because I was bad.
- What did you do?
- I'm always bad.
- Why?
I breathe.
Agnes.
What did your mother do to you?
If you can't answer, just shake your head. Did she hit you?
Did she make you do something you didn't want to do?
Did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it?
Did it embarrass you?
Did it hurt you?
What did she make you do?
- You can tell me.
- I can't.
- She's dead. She can't hurt you.
- She can.
- How?
- She watches.
Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me.
I'll protect you from her.
- She...
- Yes?
...makes me...
- Yes?
...take off my clothes, and then...
- She makes fun of me.
- She tells you you're ugly.
- That you're stupid.
- Yes.
- That you're a mistake.
- My whole body is a mistake.
Why?
She says if I don't watch out,
I'll have a baby.
- How does she know?
- Headaches.
Oh, yes.
- And then...
- What?
She touches me down there with her cigarette.
Please, Mommy.
Don't touch me like that anymore.
I'll be good.
I won't be a bad baby anymore.
Oh, Agnes.
I want you to do something.
I want you to pretend that I'm your mother.
- Tell her what you're feeling.
- I'm afraid.
Please, I want to help you.
Let me help you.
All right.
"You're ugly!"
What do you say?
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do!
"You're ugly!"
What do you say?
- No, I'm not.
- Are you pretty?
Yes.
- "You're stupid!"
- No, I'm not.
- Are you intelligent?
- I am!
- "You're a mistake!"
- I'm not!
How can I be a mistake if I'm here?
God doesn't make mistakes!
You're a mistake!
Oh, Agnes, it's all right.
It's all right.
I love you. I love you.
It's all right.
Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
I really love you.
As much as Mother Miriam loves me?
As much as God loves you.
I've been watching.
We were fine until she came.
She brought the devil here.
There was blood on her hand that night. I saw.
Agnes?
Who? Mother Superior?
What?
- Look into the convent records.
- Sister!
Good afternoon, Sister.
I'm looking for some biographical data on Sister Agnes.
Mother said I might find it here.
Thank you.
- You lied to me!
- About what?
Your niece!
- I didn't think it was important.
- It just makes you doubly responsible!
I never saw her until she came.
My sister ran away from home.
We lost touch. When I came here, she asked me to take care of Agnes.
And Agnes' father?
Any of a dozen men, from what my sister told me.
She wanted to prevent Agnes from following in her footsteps.
By keeping her home, listening to angels?
- She drank too much.
- You know what she did to her?
- I don't think I care to know.
- She molested her.
There is more than meets the eye.
Lots of dirty little secrets.
- If I'd known...
- Why didn't you?
You knew she was an alcoholic.
- I knew that after the fact.
- But why didn't you stop her?
Because I didn't know.
Oh, God.
- Larry.
- Marty, what are you doing here?
There's gotta be something missing.
I gave you the pictures.
What else?
- Maybe something they overlooked.
- What, you think she's innocent?
- I don't know.
- You gotta be crazy.
- Larry.
- You've seen the report. Cut and dry.
- Maybe something's not in the report.
- You're too involved.
Jesus. Turn this case over to someone else.
I'll see what I can come up with.
For now, go home and get some sleep.
Thanks.
If I find anything, I'll call you.
It's Helen. You missed
Mrs. Davenport's appointment.
Call her at home.
And some reporters were
trying to get ahold of you.
They seemed persistent
and may call you.
I didn't give them your number.
My name is Jean Martin. I'm writing
an article on Sister Agnes.
I'd appreciate it if you'd
give me a phone call at 942-2424.
Hi, it's me.
I just talked with Detective Crowley.
There was one thing
that didn't make it in the report.
The wastepaper basket
in Agnes' room.
None of the other nuns had one.
Bye.
- Didn't make it in the report.
The wastepaper basket
in Agnes' room.
None of the other nuns had one.
Bye.
I've gotten the court's permission to hypnotize her.
- And my permission?
- I'd like yours too.
We'll see about that.
- You'll deny it?
- I haven't decided.
- Her health is at stake.
- Spiritual health.
- I don't give a damn.
- I know you don't.
Sentence her and be done with it?
- She's a simple woman.
- An unhappy woman.
She'd be happy with us if she were left alone.
Why did you call the police?
Why didn't you just burn the baby?
- I am a moral person.
- Bullshit!
- Bullshit yourself!
- The Church doesn't...
What the hell does the Church got to do with you?
- Nothing.
- What have we done to you?
I can smell an ex-Catholic miles away.
What did we do? Burn heretics?
That was when the Church was a ruling body. So what did we do to you?
You wanted to neck and you couldn't because it was a sin?
- So instead of questioning...
- It wasn't sex.
It was a lot of things, but it wasn't sex.
My friend was run over in the 1 st grade.
The nun said she died for missing morning prayer.
- Stupid woman, that's all.
- That's all? That's enough.
- She was beautiful.
- What has that to do with it?
I wasn't. I wasn't.
The pretty one died. Why not me?
I never said my morning prayers.
And I was ugly. I had freckles.
Sister Mary Cleatis called me "Polka Dot" Livingston.
- So you left because you had freckles?
- No, because I...
Yeah.
Yeah, I left the Church because I had freckles.
As a child I could hear my guardian angel.
She sang to me until I was 6 years old.
That's when I stopped listening.
But I remember the voice.
A few years ago,
I was a nun certain of nothing.
Not even of heaven.
Not even of God.
And then one evening, I saw Agnes standing by her window, singing.
And all my doubts about myself and God were gone, in that one moment.
I recognized the voice.
Please don't take it away from me again, Dr. Livingston.
Those years after 6 were very bleak.
My sister died in a convent.
And it's her voice I hear.
Does my smoking bother you?
No, it reminds me.
Would you like one?
I'd love one.
I'm out of practice.
- All right?
- Fine, thanks.
- Suppose the saints would've smoked?
- Undoubtedly.
Not the ascetics, of course, but...
...well, Saint Thomas More.
Long, thin and filtered.
Saint Ignatius would stub out cigars on the soles of his bare feet.
- And the apostles?
- Hand-rolled.
Even Christ would partake socially.
- Saint Peter?
- Pipe.
Mary Magdalene?
"You've come a long way, baby!"
Saint Joan would chew tobacco!
All right.
What do you think today's saints smoke?
There are no saints today.
Good people, yes.
But extraordinarily good people?
- Those, we are sorely lacking.
- Do you think they ever existed?
Yes, I do.
You wanna become one?
To become? One is born a saint.
Well, you can try, can't you?
To be good?
Yes, but goodness has very little to do with it.
Not all the saints were good.
In fact, some of them were crazy.
But they were still attached to God.
Left in his hands at birth.
No more.
We're born, we live, we die.
No room for miracles.
Oh, my dear, how I miss the miracles.
You think Agnes is still attached to God?
Listen to her singing.
I'd like to begin.
- Begin what?
- The hypnotism. You still disapprove?
- Would it stop you if I did?
- No.
May I be present?
Of course.
Then let's begin.
You're listening to a chorus of angels.
Their music surrounds you like a...
...warm and comfortable pool of water.
And while you're sleeping, you're going to be able to recall...
...all the things that we want you to remember.
And when I count to three and clap my hands...
...you'll no longer be hypnotized.
- Can you hear me?
- Yes.
- Who am I?
- Dr. Livingston.
- And why am I here?
- To help me.
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
- Because I'm in trouble.
- What kind of trouble?
- What kind of trouble, Agnes?
- I'm frightened.
- Of what?
- Of telling you.
But it's easy.
It's just a breath with sound. Say it.
What kind of trouble, Agnes?
I had a baby.
- How did you have a baby?
- It came out of me.
- You knew it would?
- Yes.
- Did you want it to come out?
- No.
- Why?
- Because I was afraid.
- Why were you afraid?
- Because I wasn't worthy.
To be a mother?
- Why?
- May I open my eyes now?
No, not yet, Agnes.
Very soon, but not yet.
- How did the baby get in you?
- It grew.
- What made it grow? Do you know?
- Yes.
- Would you like to tell me?
- No.
- Did anyone else know about the baby?
- I can't tell you that.
- Will she be angry?
- She made me promise not to.
Who? Who made you promise?
It's all right, Agnes.
It's all right.
Let's go to your room.
It's a night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.
- I'm afraid.
- Don't be, I'm here. It's all right.
Tell me what you did before you went to bed.
- I ate.
- What did you have for dinner?
Fish. Brussels sprouts.
- You don't like Brussels sprouts?
- I hate them.
- And then what happened?
- We went to chapel for vespers.
I left early because
I wasn't feeling very well.
- What?
- I'm being followed.
- Sister Marguerite.
- It was her who knew about the baby?
See your room as you saw it on that night.
- Open your eyes. What do you see?
- My bed.
- What else?
- A crucifix.
Above the bed?
Anything else?
- What do you see? What is it?
- A wastepaper basket.
- Know who put it there?
- No.
- What's it for?
- My sickness.
- What do you feel?
- As if I've eaten glass.
- What do you do?
- I have to throw up.
I can't.
- One of the sisters has fed me glass.
- Which one?
- I don't know. They're all jealous.
- Of what?
Of me. Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Water. It's all water.
- Why isn't anyone coming?
- They can't hear me.
Oh, God, no, please!
I don't want this to happen.
- I don't want it.
- Stop her!
- What?
- Get away from me.
- Who?
- I don't want you here.
- Is someone in the room with you?
- No, don't touch me. Please!
- Stop her! She'll hurt herself!
- No, let her go!
- You're trying to kill my baby!
- I said, leave her alone!
No, stay in! Please, stay in!
It wasn't my fault, Mommy.
It was a mistake, Mommy.
All right, Agnes. It's all right.
One, two, three.
It's all right.
It's me, Dr. Livingston.
It's all right, it's all right.
- Thank you, Agnes. How do you feel?
- Frightened.
Do you remember what just happened?
- Yes.
- That's good.
- Do you feel well enough to stand?
- Yes.
There you go.
It's all right.
Yes, it's all right. It's all over.
It's all right, Agnes. That's right.
That's right.
That's right.
Excuse me. Hello?
I'm looking for some ground plans for the...
...Saint Mary Magdalene Convent in Berthierville.
Oh, very interesting, I guess.
Excuse me.
This has everything.
Even the secret entrances.
They all had them.
Usually to get from building to building in the snow.
That's how he got in.
Or she got out.
Excuse me. What did you say?
Nothing. May I take some notes?
Okay.
- Is the doctor in her office?
- Who is calling?
- General MacArthur.
- Just a minute. You can't go in there!
- It's okay. Close the door.
- We're taking you off the case.
If we want to hire a psychiatrist, we'll find our own.
- Who'll ask questions you want asked.
- One with objectivity and respect!
- For the Church?
- For Agnes.
- Think she's a saint?
- She's touched by God.
How? She hallucinates, stops eating, and bleeds.
That's why she can't be touched?
Give me a miracle!
- The father.
- Who is he?
Why must he be anybody?
- My God. You're crazy.
- I'm saying it's possible.
- How? A white dove?
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Give me an explanation!
- A miracle has no explanation.
If she can put a hole in her hand without a nail...
...she can split a cell in her womb.
- This is insane.
No man could have gotten in that night.
- God did it?
- That's like saying Martineau did it.
- I'm saying God permitted it.
- But how?
- You won't find all the answers.
- You don't believe in miracles.
But I want the opportunity to believe.
You believe a lie because you won't face that she was raped or seduced...
...or was the seducer!
- She's innocent.
She's not an enigma. What she's done is explainable through psychiatry...
...one, two, three.
- That's what you believe?
- That's what I have to believe!
- Why are you so obsessed with her?
You think about her all the time.
You're bent on saving her. Why?
I'm not accusing, I'm recognizing.
There's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. Did you know that?
There's an answer.
That's how she got out.
- How could she find out?
- Somebody told her.
- It hasn't been used for 50 years.
- Stop lying, Mother!
- Why would I lie?
- Because it's murder!
She told us there was another person.
Who was that person, Mother?
Was it you?
If it's murder, then it's the Crown
Attorney you have to talk to, not me.
And definitely not Agnes.
Not too fast. No.
- All I want is one more week.
- Why?
Mother Miriam is very adamant about this.
- You haven't shown any progress.
- I'm getting to her.
You're getting to all of us.
- I'll have a decision by next week.
- It's gone on long enough.
- Joe, she didn't kill the baby.
- You have proof?
- I will.
- When?
Next week, I'll get you new evidence.
No.
Tomorrow. I'll get it by tomorrow.
I will.
Yeah.
Excuse me, Mother.
Dr. Livingston's here.
- You'll take her apart.
- Where is she?
- Hasn't she had enough?
- I have more questions.
- You're determined.
- Who knew she was pregnant?
- Why do you persecute her?
- Was it you?
- Did you know she was pregnant?
- Yes.
- You didn't send her to a doctor?
- It was too late.
For an abortion?
Too late for what?
- To stop it.
- The baby?
- The scandal.
- You went to help.
- She didn't want help.
- You wanted it gone.
- No.
- The wastebasket.
It was for the blood and sheets.
And the baby. You used the cord.
No, I wanted her to have the baby when no one else was around.
But there was so much blood, I panicked.
- After you killed the child?
- I left it with her to go for help.
- I doubt that's what she'll say.
- Then she's a liar!
- Agnes, can you hear me?
- Yes.
I want you to remember a night last January.
The night Sister Paul died.
Do you remember?
What's the matter?
- She said, "Michael."
- What did she mean?
The statue. She had shown it to me the day before.
- And the passage to the barn?
- Yes.
- Why?
- So I could go to him.
- Who?
- Him.
- She knew about him?
- She'd seen him too.
- Where?
- From the bell tower before she died.
- So she sent you?
- Yes.
What happened?
- He's here.
- Are you frightened?
Yes.
Hello?
Where are you?
Is it you?
But I'm afraid.
Yes. Yes, I do.
Why me?
Wait. I want to see you.
What do you see?
Halos. Dividing and dividing.
Feathers are stars falling.
Falling into the iris of God's eye.
It's so lovely. It's so blue!
Yellow, black wings, brown, blood!
No. Red! His blood!
My God, I'm bleeding!
I'm bleeding!
It won't stop!
I can't get it to stop!
- Let go of me! I wish you were dead.
- Agnes.
- Stay away from me!
- Agnes.
That man in the barn did a terrible thing to you.
He hurt you. It's not your fault.
It's his fault. Tell us who he is.
- We'll stop him.
- It's your fault.
- Who did you see?
- I hate him.
- Who?
- I hate him for what he did to me.
- For what he made me go through.
- Who?
- Agnes, who did this to you?
- God!
It was God!
And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him.
You won't. It's all right to hate him.
- Enough.
- And the baby?
- She can't remember!
- The baby.
- It was dead.
- It was alive.
- I don't remember.
- It was alive, wasn't it?
Yes!
- Mother Miriam was with you?
- Yes.
- She took the baby.
- Yes.
You saw it all, didn't you?
And then, what did she do?
Agnes, what did she do?
She...
...left me alone with that little thing.
I looked at it.
And I thought, this is a mistake.
But it's my mistake, not Mommy's.
God's mistake.
I thought I can save her.
I can give her back to God.
- What did you do?
- I put her to sleep.
How?
I tied the cord around her neck.
Wrapped her in the bloody sheets...
...and stuffed her in the trash can.
In view of the situation as it now stands...
...and the testimony given here this morning...
...it seems quite clear that the defendant...
...was in no manner responsible for her actions.
It is the judgment of this court...
...that she be returned to the convent of Mary Magdalene...
...where she will be cared for under proper medical supervision...
...by a visiting physician.
Do you have something to say?
I stood in the window of my room...
...every night for a week.
And one night, I heard the most beautiful voice imaginable.
And when I looked...
...I saw the moon shining down on him.
For six nights he sang to me...
...songs I had never heard.
And on the seventh night, he opened his wings...
...and lay on top of me.
And all the while he sang.
Please remove her from the court.
Would someone please remove the defendant from the courtroom?
I don't know the meaning
behind the song she sang.
Perhaps it was a song of seduction,
and the father was a field hand.
Perhaps it was a lullaby she
remembered from many years ago...
... and the father was hope
and love and desire.
And a belief in miracles.
I want to believe
that she was blessed.
And I do miss her.
And I hope that she's left something,
some little part of herself with me.
That would be miracle enough,
wouldn't it?
Oh, baby.
Okay?
I can't...
Is this okay?
IDs, fellas.
Invites, guys, invites.
Invites and IDs, guys.
Invites and IDs.
IDs, fellas.
Invites and IDs, fellas.
Welcome to the Yankees.
All right, have a good breakfast.
Go ahead. Go on in, young man.
Welcome to the third annual
"Meet the Yankees" breakfast.
Have a seat, fellas.
The Yankees will be here in a few minutes.
How you guys doing?
Yo, bro. Where are the Yankees at?
They're coming.
You a Yankee?
- You don't recognise me?
- Shortstop?
- Used to be.
- What?
Sure.
Holy cow!
- I thought so.
- You're the Scooter!
Yo, Efram, this dude is Phil Rizzuto.
Do that again.
Holy cow!
How come you're pouring us juice?
How we get to the game after?
I ain't got no car.
- We got you covered.
- Word. Yanks up in here?
- Yeah.
- All right. Bust it out.
Yo, Scooter.
I'm good.
Go ahead, get yourself something to eat.
I got some good news, and I got some bad news.
Which you want to hear first?
Good news, good news!
Fuck that.
Give up the bad news, homeboy.
Bad news wins.
The Yanks can't make it here, guys.
You can't make it over to the stadium.
We got 45 outstanding warrants eating our pancakes here.
On behalf of the New York Yankees... and the New York City Career
Criminals Investigation Unit... you are all under arrest.
Sorry, guys. We got you.
- What's the good news?
- Good news is coming around.
Excuse me.
I'd like to propose a toast.
Hold it.
To Detective Frank Keller... on today, his 20th anniversary on the job.
I can't believe you're not retiring.
I get 20 years and a wake-up call, and I'm history.
Take half my pay...
Open a motel, a bar, a polygraph school...
I'm going to be 46 years old in some alley... sticking my pencil in some dead skull looking for a bullet?
Nothing wrong with motels.
I'll visit you.
I'll get you plenty of towels.
Anyway, congratulations.
Am I too late?
Got an invitation?
Yeah.
Who's this?
That's my son.
Ernest Lee, the invitation's for you only.
I can hardly meet Dave Winfield without taking my boy.
You got ID, Ernest?
Yeah.
Grand theft auto... two counts.
We're all booked up, Ernest.
- I got an invite.
- I said we're all booked up.
- Thanks, man.
- Catch you later.
Gruber.
Frank Keller.
How you doing?
I wake you?
Could I speak with my wife, please?
Yeah, my ex-wife.
Denise. How you doing?
I wake you?
I'm sorry. Listen.
I gotta talk to you.
I think...
I got appendicitis.
Hello?
Mr. Mackey!
Mr. Mackey?
Thank you, chief.
Where's it at?
18-F.
Anybody talk to you?
No one of weight.
No one of weight?
You ever on the job?
Me?
I'm just a square badge.
I was in Korea, though.
I could have sworn you were on the job.
Listen, I'll come down.
We'll talk later, okay?
I'm of weight.
"You ever on the job?"
Oh, shit.
It's called making people feel good... so they'll cooperate with you.
You should try it sometime.
I'm sorry about that phone thing last night.
I'm having a mid-life crisis.
I don't want you calling at 3:00 a.m. Anymore.
You want to talk to Denise, call at decent hours.
Decent hours? What's that?
9:00 a.m. To what?
Dinnertime? 8:00 p.m.?
I can't believe those guys.
You never saw Joe Louis.
In the bedroom.
Joe Louis?
Where did you see him?
Way before you were born, in Chicago.
They called him The Brown Bomber.
He was gorgeous.
You want to take the lady outside?
Getting a little crowded in here.
And your prints, too, chief.
What's this guy's name?
James...
Mackey.
Mack the Knife.
You know... when she was married to me...
I was never gonna die.
We fight, we split... she goes to you.
So it goes. Life is forever, right?
What do I care?
I passed my 20 yesterday.
Everybody says retire... so...
I feel kind of mortal all of a sudden.
Know what I mean?
I say this guy's dead 48 hours.
No.
Look at the lividity.
It's more like 36.
Smells like 48.
Smells like 36.
I was just trying to get some attention.
You know?
I apologise.
It was just... we're in the same squad... six years.
We don't so much as have a beer together.
How the hell do you take my wife away?
I didn't take nobody nowhere.
You understand?
You didn't treat her right.
She walked.
I didn't treat her right?
She walked!
You want to kick somebody's ass about it, you kick your own.
Fuckface.
I'll check everybody out, but truthfully... it boils down to grabbing the strange trim... he got hooked up with.
This guy's a swordsman extraordinaire.
Could be one of these ladies gets pissed off... because, you know, they're in bed... he starts moaning "Mary" instead of "Gladys."
"Hell hath no fury," and all that.
How do you know the trim is strange?
Maybe it's a steady.
Strange. You know how I know?
Records, 45s.
Nobody whips out their old 45s, except on a first or second date... when you're doing
"the wonder of me" thing.
Getting to know you.
So what do you do?
Take out old records, show the broad you kept them all these years... meaning you're a wonderful, sentimental individual.
Who does that with somebody they know already?
Once you know them, who gives a shit?
How you doing, chief?
Working hard or hardly working?
Little of both. How you doing?
Okay.
You think of anybody else yet?
The mailman maybe came by in the afternoon.
I don't remember.
There was a cable TV repair guy here, I think.
What's that, Cable Time? Cable Tone?
But he was down in the basement.
Pretty much what I told you yesterday.
What about ladies?
See any young ladies?
See any of them?
You told me there was a sex parade.
If I'm looking to see somebody in particular, I'll see them.
If not, if I'm hailing a cab, or in the package room...
Okay. We'll talk again.
So the emcee says to the first husband:
"Where did your wife say...
"was the most exotic place you ever made love to her?"
So this guy's thinking, right?
He's got a brain like a friggin' pea... but he's thinking.
Finally he says, "In the butt."
You get it?
Hey, anybody do any work over at 365 West End Avenue Monday?
I was over there.
Did you see anybody over there, not looking right?
You know, freaked out, scared?
Running, like, lost?
No, I saw a couple ladies going to the laundry room.
Why? What happened?
There was a shooting.
If you remember, you want to give me a call?
Yeah, sure.
Thank you very much.
So good.
Please.
Excuse me.
A toast for our host.
Ten promotions overdue.
Meet your detectives.
Tommy Squibb, detective third grade.
Felix King, detective third grade.
Dave Pines, detective third grade.
Hey, fellas!
Come on, I'm giving a toast here.
Tommy Squibb, detective third grade.
All right, George.
Where the hell did you learn that?
That's like watching a movie.
It keeps me fit.
I get in a beef with a guy, I hit him fast, a lot, I'm out of there.
I don't like getting hurt.
God gave fat guys guns, so we wouldn't have to do that.
You're Frank Keller?
- I'm Sherman Touhey from the 112.
- Forest Hills?
I heard you caught a good one.
Face-down taxpayer, back of the head in his own bed?
Me, too, on Yellowstone Blvd.
- No shit?
- The bullet, we can't do nothing with it.
It got pancaked on the bed frame.
We got cigarette butts with lipstick on them.
- We didn't get any butts.
- Get any prints?
Yeah, nothing showed up on the files, though.
Let's compare tomorrow.
Dewars, double Dewars on the rocks.
Budweiser.
You know something?
You talk lipstick.
I think my guy got done by a broad.
How's that?
We're talking a four-star ladies' man here, okay?
You play, you pay. Am I right?
My wedding night, I wake up... my wife's got the tattoo needle, the eyeshades.
I look down,
I've got "property of" on my balls.
I'm only kidding, but catch my drift?
This guy, I found 30 letters... from the singles magazine he placed an ad in.
He didn't even get around to opening them.
You find any records there?
What do you mean, like files?
Records, like old records, 45s.
One was playing on the turntable when they found him: Sea of Love.
Remember that one?
Sea of Love? Jesus.
Come with me, my love
to the sea
the sea of love
I want to tell you
how much I love you
Do you remember
when we met?
That's the day
I knew you were my pet
I wanna tell you
how much I love you
Something's got to come off.
That's it?
No, you gotta take something off.
Come on, take it off!
I just met this guy.
Actually, I admire this woman... whoever she is, for her directness.
I mean, the guy fucks around on her... falls asleep, whatever.
Bingo!
Pop him in the head, it's over.
Other women, like my ex-wife Denise, for example... you step out of line a little, she'd like to stick it here... stick it there, let you walk around bleeding.
This one, bingo! No muss, no fuss.
Evelyn Woods School of Speed Revenge.
No walking wounded.
Fuckin' women!
Hey, Grube, let me ask you something.
Your wife, does she ever like to stick it to you?
What are you trying to say?
You're a happily married man.
Maybe Gruber's too busy sticking it into her... to notice when she's sticking it into him.
Break it up!
Guys, come on, break it up!
Are you okay?
Come on. He's crazy. Let's go.
Fuck it.
"Silver balloons
"A lifetime of Junes
"Old rock tunes"
Who the hell are you?
Wait a minute.
What's my name?
This isn't funny.
I said, what's my name?
Jim Mackey.
So you answered his ad in the New York Weekly?
I don't know why I'm crying.
I never even got to meet him.
It's just so sad, somebody dying.
So you wrote him, or you called him?
I wrote him... and then he called me.
Fate sucks, I swear.
Gina... maybe you'd feel better... if you took those balloons off.
They're the only things keeping me up.
Frank.
The lieutenant said I could go through the jacket on your case.
Guess what? The prints match.
The same doer. Ain't that grand?
Well, I got one for you, my man.
Your guy put an ad in a singles magazine, right?
New York Weekly.
Bingo to that.
My guy's in there, too.
"Silver balloons, endless Junes,
Old rock tunes
"Let me put it in your moon"
Wire Paladin. Something like that.
You want to hear my guy?
"City streets beneath my feet
"4:00 a.m., the longest hour
"The hunt goes on till the break of dawn
"for love, the rarest flower"
This lady, she's in the crosshairs.
Poetry lover.
More like she hates it, you know what I mean?
Listen,
I had my lieu talk to your lieu... and me and you, a two-man task force on this.
What do you think?
- Queens or here?
- Are you fucking kidding me?
I'd kill to work in Manhattan.
You want to work in Queens?
Let me introduce you.
Let me catch them tomorrow.
I gotta split.
I got a tuxedo fitting in an hour.
Tuxedo? You got a lounge act?
My daughter's getting married Sunday out on the Island.
You like weddings?
Get out of here!
Want to dance with a couple of bridesmaids?
Want to know how we catch her?
We put in our own ad.
Say what?
New York Weekly magazine.
We put our own ad in.
A hundred guys place ads in there a month.
They get 30 to 50 responses each.
That's 4,000 or 5,000 women.
What are we gonna do?
Go out with 5,000 women? Hell, no.
We know the broad is into rhyming ads, right?
So we put in a rhyming ad.
"Moon, June, spoon, sand dune."
We set up dates with 30, 40, 50 of the ladies who answer.
We take them out, some restaurant, some bar... get their prints on a wineglass.
Bingo! She's dropped.
I love it.
That's horseshit, but I love it.
Do you know how many guys placed ads last month that rhymed?
Three.
She went out with two of them.
Shit!
I can't believe we haven't chased down that third guy.
Raymond Brown,
8130 Austin Avenue, Kew Gardens.
I tracked him through his post-box.
- What are you, a fucking cop?
- Sometimes.
Gruber.
I'll catch up with you.
How you doing?
This 20-year thing, it's kicking my ass.
I'm sorry.
"Raymond Brown,
Downtown Brown."
Here we go.
"Loneliness and silence
"Envelop a heart that pounds like thunder
"All the love I have inside
"Is ripping me asunder
"The city is a jungle of pain
"But my love is from the soul"
"So be so kind as to answer this ad
"And you can ride on my pole"
Give the guy a break.
This is a major lonely heart.
Major?
Good afternoon,
I'm Detective Frank Keller.
This is Detective Sherman Touhey.
Does a Raymond Brown live here?
Daddy!
What's the matter?
They're cops.
What's up, fellas?
What's wrong?
Relax.
Are you all right?
I want to tell you something.
I love my family.
Raymond, no kidding.
We don't give a shit.
All we need are the names of those you went out with and their letters.
I don't have letters.
Raymond, there's some psycho woman out there killing guys.
I swear,
I didn't go out with any of them.
I threw them away.
I didn't have the heart to do it.
Raymond, you take the time... to make up this beautiful poem... about loneliness and silence.
You spring $300 to put the ad in the magazine.
You spring another $500 a month for some love nest in the Village...
$50 for the post office box... and you're trying to tell us you never went out with any of them?
Raymond, please.
You know what the worst part of being a cop is?
Eight hours a day, all you hear from people are lies.
"I didn't do it. I wasn't there.
It was somebody else.
"Blah this. Blah that."
I swear on the eyes of my children.
30 sit-downs, 30 sets of prints...
Miss Wrong, we got her.
Upstairs gives us $300 to put the ad in the magazine... we spring for a few vinos, a chef's salad or two... bag the wine glasses, it's all over.
What? Come on.
"What? Come on?"
Suppose I pull out $300 of my own money, buy the ad myself... we drop her, you pay me back like a personal bet?
This thing's gonna work.
If you want me to, I'll set you up with my sister-in-law.
She's got great tits, divorced, no kids, no cats.
Lieu's sister-in-law sounds great.
"I swear on the eyes of my children."
We should've tailed him.
We fucked up.
He fucked up.
Don't take them out of the restaurant.
Don't lay a hand on them.
- Don't have intercourse with them.
- It's over. I'm not doing it.
You converse, you get prints and you split.
You wear a wire, we'll have a sound van outside... and a two-man backup at another table.
Keep the restaurant receipts.
I don't want to have to read about this in the Village Voice.
What's with the backup and wire?
What's she going to do?
Confess? Shoot me?
We're in a restaurant.
To make me happy, okay?
Now, who's writing the ad?
Who's the poet?
"Roses are red
"Violets are blue
"I got one yea-long
"And it's all for you"
"I got one yea-long!"
Check it out.
I got one!
Check this one out.
"Windswept hallways in my heart
"Echo the blackness of eternity"
Get out! What is he,
Edgar Allan Poe, this guy?
I'll be sitting across from Morticia Addams.
- Thing!
- Gomez!
She's a shooter, right?
So, how about something like:
"Many a girl has shot me down"
"I've been shot before..."
"Shot me down..."
"I'm hot to trot, give Frank a shot"
"I live alone
"within myself, like a hut within the woods
"I keep my heart high upon the shelf
"barren of other goods
"I need another's arms to reach for it
"and place it where it belongs
"I need another's touch and smile
"to fill my hut with songs"
Not bad.
It's a little corny, but it's good.
- Better than what we got.
- Did you just make that up, Mr. K?
Frank's mother wrote that.
High school, 1934.
She was a goddamn beautiful person.
Go ahead. Use it.
She'd have liked that.
Good poem.
I really liked that.
You guys are fucking slobs.
And you're GQ.
See you later, Frank.
Pop.
Come on.
You stay here with me tonight.
Come on.
That's it.
Where are you taking me?
That's good.
Am I walking?
I'm walking, right?
It'll pass for it, Dad.
That warrant isn't for me.
You got the wrong guy.
Sorry, Frank.
Okay, kid.
Smell a shooter in there?
I don't know, Gloria.
I just got this hopeful feeling when I read your letter.
It's just... I can't explain it.
I'm a printer.
My own business.
Amanda? My mother's name was Amanda.
Miranda?
You're a what? That's what?
You like guys and girls?
Or girls?
I got an aunt named Carmen.
That's cool.
Carmen Miranda.
Me?
Sometimes, but mainly girls.
You've a lovely voice.
You should be on radio.
Women, you know?
How's around...
Are you a night owl?
Solid. Let's get crazy, then.
Taxi!
Not that I haven't done this before.
Shove this in here.
I've wanted to do this all night.
- Is he on, Bill?
- Yeah.
I look natural?
You look good.
Okay, kids.
Can I help you?
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.
- Chair this evening?
- Yes, thank you.
Cocktail this evening?
Cocktails? Yeah.
What kind, sir?
- A little bourbon and water.
- Bourbon and water it is.
Come back now.
Do you remember
when we met?
That's the day
I knew you were my pet
Can I get a little hi-de-hi here?
If I look half as good as you at your age...
You got nothing to worry about.
You look great.
You're very sweet.
It's just that I should've said on the phone that I'm the age I am.
Look, I'm telling you something.
You look better than three-quarters of the girls...
I know that are half your age.
Did that come out right?
Yes, thank you. I'll buy that.
I'll quit while I'm ahead.
The lady would like another white wine?
- Yes, please.
- And I'm fine here.
I got it. I'm taking it out now.
Watch it!
We need some more dinner plates out front, on the double.
They're coming out now.
What do we do now?
Well, I'll tell you, I gotta pick up my son in half an hour, so it's...
My timing's terrible.
Should we have dinner sometime?
Sure. We'll call you.
"We"?
- I said "we"?
- Yes.
That's me, all day on the phone, it's "we this, we that."
Meaning my company. I'll call you.
Check, please.
I'll call you. Me.
No, you won't.
Oh, well.
I don't know.
I get this very weird feeling you're not who you say you are.
There's something not right about this.
What do you mean? Like what?
You got cop's eyes.
Cop's eyes?
You look at me,
I feel like I did something.
Like you did something? Like what?
My ex-husband was a cop.
What did you say?
What are you, you're a printer?
If you're a printer, I got a dick.
I didn't doubt it for a minute, baby.
Think you could go for a babe with a dick?
Depends on her personality, really.
So you're divorced, right?
I said that.
You got kids? Kid. One kid. A boy?
No. A girl.
You got a girl, right?
You know, it's interesting, your coming from...
York, Pennsylvania, because in a way... you went from York to New York.
You like the park, and I like the beach.
You like movies, I like plays.
You're a printer,
I manage a shoe store.
And I don't believe in wasting time on this stuff.
You know what you know, and you go with it.
You go with what?
You're just not my type.
I mean, you just sat down.
Give it a little bit of time.
I believe in animal attraction.
I believe in love at first sight.
I believe in this.
And I don't feel it with you.
I'm hell on wheels once you know me.
How are you folks doing here?
Is that wine okay, miss?
You haven't even touched your glass.
Have a little sip.
You know, warm up.
Let's raise a glass here. Come on.
Come on, here.
Let's have a happy hunting toast.
It's nothing personal.
Come on. Where are you going?
Kiss my tiara, bitch. Look at that.
I didn't get prints.
I didn't get prints.
How many more of these have we got?
Okay, that's two more.
Two more.
Oh, no.
Mercy, mercy.
How are you doing, Frank?
- Anything on the prints?
- Nothing yet.
How's your head?
It couldn't be worse.
How are you doing?
Terry. Cable Tone.
Yeah. What's up?
I was just telling your partner that there was a kid there that day.
A black kid.
I think he was from the supermarket...
'cause I saw him come in with groceries earlier on.
Anyhow, I'm working down in the basement.
About 20 minutes later... he comes tearing through there like a bat out of hell.
No groceries.
I mean, why is he going back out through the basement, right?
There is a lobby, right?
The kid has those... black militant corn holes.
I mean, corn rows in his hair.
He looks like a real shitbag, if you ask me.
How are you doing, chief?
One of your kids got corn rows?
You know, afro hairdo?
- Stevie Wonder hair.
- Wonder hair?
Reggie, he means Quawi.
- Where's he at?
- You got me. I fired his ass Monday.
How come?
He goes to make a delivery, he doesn't like the tip... so he starts screaming at the customer.
You got his address?
Maybe.
What did he do, kill somebody?
Quawi Benjamin.
"Spooney." Call him that, he goes crazy.
I got nothing here.
He only worked, like, a week or so.
If he comes in, or if you see him somewhere...
Call us?
Sure.
"Hell on wheels," huh?
How quickly we forget.
No, I don't forget you.
You're the "animal attraction"?
"Love at first sight."
What, do you live around here?
88th Street.
Yeah? I live on 85th.
You know that poem you wrote?
You didn't write it.
I read that poem in the magazine... and figured, this is either a very sensitive guy... or else he ripped off some lady's poem... or some girl's poem.
You didn't write it, right?
Nope.
Some lady did, right?
My mother wrote it, some 50-odd years ago.
That's why my father fell in love with her.
Something like that.
Is that true?
So he says.
I like that.
I like that you did that.
You want to hear my idea of poetry?
Precision in life.
Knowing when and how to make your move.
Say your piece... like you the other night with me.
That was... poetry in motion.
Beautiful.
Look at me.
What?
You still want to go have that
"happy hunting toast"?
What happened to the animal attraction?
What are you, fucking nuts?
What if she's the doer?
We won't get the prints back till tomorrow.
Wait till then.
Come on, the doer's down south somewhere.
Spooney, Quawi, whatever his name is.
Listen.
This one walked. You remember her?
You with that bitch who wouldn't even drink with you?
It's good in a way.
Maybe I'll get her prints now.
Bullshit! What are you gonna do?
Send your dick to the lab?
That'll be some great testimony if she's the one.
"You see, Your Honour...
"first I whipped it out, then she whipped it out."
You catch my drift?
How do you know it's this Quawi kid?
It's probably a broad.
You know that.
She's a friggin' suspect.
Just walk away.
Frankie, just walk away.
Nothing to it, chief.
That's it. I'm walking. Okay?
See you tomorrow.
No, just a girlfriend.
Okay. Thanks a lot.
I'll talk to you later.
Something came up, you know?
Isn't that crazy?
What's your name again?
Helen.
You know why I got married?
I was 37 and I wasn't married.
So I got married.
How do you like that?
I can top that.
You want to know why I got married?
Some guy says to me, "I love you."
I knew him a week.
Playing hard to get?
Yeah, right.
We didn't last very long,
I'll tell you that.
Me, neither.
The wedding lasted longer than the marriage.
But we still...
We're still friends... sort of.
- You?
- Friends? No.
I found out I was pregnant,
I walked.
You walked? What do you mean?
The guy doesn't know about the kid?
No. He's out of the picture.
You know, sometimes, when I think about... the people I got involved with, the choices I made... it's pretty amazing, but I found something out.
There are very few mistakes in life that can't be corrected... if you got the guts.
If you got the guts?
Last call.
What are they, bombing us?
Oh, man.
You know, when it gets late sometimes...
I feel like a big cat... in a small cage.
Yeah?
You know...
I have done some desperate, foolish things... come 3:00 a.m.
You mean like being here with me?
Where's your bathroom?
- Where's your bathroom?
- Over there.
Where's my bag?
Get in bed.
Jesus Christ.
For God's sake.
Holy fuck.
What the fuck?
Oh, shit.
Holy fuck.
Oh, my God.
Holy fuck.
I can't believe it.
Fuck! Jesus!
What did you do?
Where did you put it?
No! What are you doing?
Open the door!
Open this fucking door!
What is it?
This ain't real.
Open this fucking door!
It's a starter's pistol. I saw...
You goddamn son of a bitch!
Don't you ever fucking put your hands on me!
I got scared.
Tell me about scared!
What are you doing with a starter's pistol?
None of your goddamn business!
Get off me.
Listen to me!
I saw the gun sticking out of the purse.
I freaked, okay? It was a reflex.
Feel my heart. Feel it.
Go ahead.
It's like a drum.
Feel it?
I'll tell you some stories about scared sometime.
You don't know.
This city, what it does to people...
I can't apologise enough for...
I don't know,
I got this survival rush.
You start to think with your hands, not your...
Like an animal.
Did I hurt you?
No.
What?
What are you looking for?
What are you doing?
What are you looking for?
Jesus.
Oh, baby.
Jesus.
What are you looking for?
It was just too late to call you back.
Okay.
Yeah, just a friend.
Okay, I'll be home.
I'll be home when I get home. Bye.
You're killing me.
Is that the sun?
Are we still alive?
I thought you were an insomniac.
I am.
I must have fainted.
What are you doing over there?
I can't even make you out.
Helen, right?
Come here.
What?
I gotta talk to you.
There's something I got to say.
You've gotta be kidding.
I'm kidding.
Good.
Are you kidding?
I'm gonna have to be airlifted to a standing position.
But you, you're something.
You go in the kitchen, you make coffee, you come in here.
- What are you, Superman?
- Wonder Woman.
What do you wonder about?
I wonder how we made it through last night in one piece.
Last night?
Let me tell you about last night.
Let me tell you.
Cut it out.
I have to get home, to my daughter.
Your daughter?
She's with your mother, right?
Your mother live with you?
She's just helping us out for a couple of weeks.
I don't know about this.
What's it like working in a print shop?
A print shop?
Yeah.
Inky.
What's it like running a shoe store?
It's okay.
But we don't live for our work, do we?
No. I always like to think
I live for love.
I mean, what else is there? Food?
- You're something else.
- No, you're something else.
You've no idea how many creeps there are out there.
You're wired like no one I ever met... but you're a good man.
You never know.
I always know.
Or at least I find out.
What do you mean, creeps?
Manipulators.
Liars.
Guys who wait till you're in deep... before you find out who they really are... guys who, all of a sudden, you're fighting for your life.
Creeps.
You asked.
You got any cigarettes?
You smoke?
- Sometimes. Does that bother you?
- What brand?
I mooch.
I think I'm out.
Let's see here.
See any jump out at me?
I gotta go.
I gotta go.
I like to be home when my daughter wakes up.
Hello.
Keller here.
Guess what? She's still out there.
None of the prints match up.
So should we dust your dick?
You know, cover all bases?
Would you finish that sale?
Can I help you with something, sir?
Yeah, you got this in a sneaker?
I was in the neighbourhood, so I thought I'd come in.
- Why are you whispering?
- I'm whispering?
Yeah.
Sorry. I just want to talk to you.
Why don't you have a seat?
I'll be with you in a minute.
So, what did you want to talk to me about?
I was going to ask you about something.
About some of the people you've been seeing... over the past month or so.
You know, guys.
It's none of your business.
- It is, in a way, my business.
- Yeah? And how's that?
Forget it. It's stupid.
Look, I don't sleep around, if that's what you're talking about.
No, that's not it.
Look, why don't you come over to my house tonight for dinner... and we can talk about it?
Lady.
- Yeah, you, I was in here, what...
- Six months, right?
Yeah, six months ago, and... you had this real beautiful boot.
It was Vivoli, Vavoli, Ravioli, or something like that.
Vivoli. We're out of stock.
You can try back in about two weeks, if you like.
Look, can I help you with something, or what?
Come on, man, what's your problem?
Tommy, let's blow. The guy's a cop.
Let's blow.
So, if I beat the shit out of you...
I'd get nailed for assaulting an officer, right?
You piece of shit.
Okay, what?
You're a cop?
Yeah.
So what?
Pretty bad, huh?
It's just too much for you.
I mean, you let scum like that in here... but my being a cop, that's just too much, isn't it?
Let me tell you something about this.
All these people in here, with their rocks and their furs... they get robbed, they get raped,
I'm all of a sudden their daddy.
Come the wet-ass hour,
I'm everybody's daddy!
What do you think you're doing?
What do you mean?
Don't try to turn this around on me.
You lied to me.
You looked like
I had the plague over there.
Why did you tell me you were a printer? You're a cop.
- I always wanted to be a printer.
- Come on. Talk to me.
For 20 years,
I go out with people, right?
I tell them I'm a cop.
You know what happens?
I'm a nonperson.
What do you think
I put the ad in the paper for?
Look, you ever keep something inside yourself?
But you know you'll let it out.
I just want to get on solid ground with you.
I wanted us to know each other a little bit, before I told you.
That's all.
I wanted to bring it along slowly.
So you're a cop?
I'm Frank.
I'm just Frank.
Don't lie to me again.
I don't like it.
Look at these. They're so soft.
They feel like feet.
They're very subtle.
Wild, right?
This girl, you know...
My girl gave them to me.
Gotta wear them, right?
What are you gonna do?
Pretty jazzy.
You know, look at these things.
She works in a shoe store.
No offence, but you never did get her prints.
She's not the shooter.
And this we know how?
I asked her.
- Golden Cadillac?
- Screaming Golden Cadillac.
What makes it scream?
Getting attacked by a White Russian.
That's very clever.
Make that two.
- Want yours screaming, too?
- You have very tight skin.
You know that?
That's 'cause I'm fat. It pushes it out like balloon rubber.
Excuse me, did you not get that order or what?
See you.
I bet I've seen eight women tonight.
I bet every one made more money than me.
That blonde, she was a school principal.
I mean, how come none of these women are married?
I don't know.
How come I'm not married?
Gentlemen, anyone here up for the Island of Lost Souls?
- No, not me tonight, kids.
- What's the matter, Frank?
I don't know. I'm tired.
You're tired?
I'm going to walk home.
Tired?
Talk to you tomorrow, kids.
All right, Frank.
Hey, how you doing?
Did I wake you?
Listen... is your daughter asleep?
You think you can get somebody to watch her for a while?
Good.
What have you got on?
No, take them off.
I was just... Sea of Love.
What?
You have Sea of Love.
I don't know.
I haven't looked in those boxes in years.
Why? Do you like that record?
Yeah, I like it.
I'm saving them for my daughter.
Probably worth a fortune by now.
I bet they'd fall apart if I put them on the turntable.
You never play them?
I don't even know what's in there anymore.
You want something to drink?
Yeah.
A lot of people keep records, huh?
I should have kept mine.
I had thousands of them.
They'd be worth something now.
You better go home before it gets light out.
Okay.
I want you to see something.
Beautiful.
How would you know?
You didn't even look at her.
What do you mean?
I didn't want to wake her.
I wonder what kind of father you would make.
Me?
I don't know, you know...
Who the hell wants a policeman for a father?
She's got a father, doesn't she?
I mean, she does have a father.
You know what I mean?
Go home.
He's not dead.
You're divorced, right?
Yeah.
You mad at me?
No.
Okay.
Okay.
Is your mother back yet?
Can you stay with me tonight?
Good. I've got something very important to talk to you about.
Okay? I'm gonna take you somewhere, so I want you to dress nice.
Waiter!
I'm being paged now.
Can I call you back?
All right. Okay. Take care.
Come with me, my love
How are you doing, folks?
A little something from the bar?
I know you. You're that cop.
- Hold it. You're a police officer?
- Did you get fired?
- This is Gina.
- What do you want with me?
Just sit down. It's okay.
This is Gina Gallagher.
Hi, Gina.
This is Detective Sherman Touhey.
She's good people.
Hi.
I'm gone.
I feel like Betty fucking Crocker in this.
Jesus, it's only 8:00, and I'm hammered.
I'm gonna stay around here tonight.
If I drive, I'll die like a dog.
It would make a nice headline.
I'll call the wife, tell her I'll crash around here.
Get a hotel.
Go to the squad room.
There's this nice cosy army cot there, man.
Go ahead.
I got extra keys for my old man.
I'm two blocks away.
We'll sleep together?
Why not?
I'm going to see this Helen later.
I got this hotel suite.
An ex-partner of mine is head of security... so he owes me one.
It'll be a nice surprise.
You see this guy
This guy's in love with you
I'm gonna ask her to move in with me.
What, are you nuts?
You just met her.
I feel like a fucking teenager.
The guy says to me, "Frank, retire."
I say, "To what?"
There's nothing out there after this.
Could you get the waiter, please?
Is there a waiter in this place?
That's what I'd like to know.
So, what's this important thing you wanted to ask me?
What?
Maybe you should slow it down a little, huh, Frank?
Maybe a menu should come here sometime this century.
What's the big question you wanted to ask?
I don't know.
I feel like I got the London Philharmonic up my ass.
Let's go. Come on.
- We just got here.
- I know. Let's get out of here.
Bad choice.
Not my favourite place.
I love this neighbourhood.
I figure the worst that could happen to me here... is I'd trip over an old Perrier bottle.
Could get worse, you know.
Nicey-nice, this neighbourhood, huh?
Hold it.
Last year alone, we had three murders right in this block.
See that garage over there?
One in there.
The building across the street, second floor. One in there.
Two months later, third floor.
One in there.
This town is like one big city of the dead for you, huh?
City of the dead?
What do you say that for?
I love life.
I'm just trying to share with you.
If you live with a cop...
I mean, there are certain things... you know, a cop's eyes, what we see...
There's you, what you see... which is like nothing... and our eyes, our life, what we see.
If you live with a cop?
What?
You said, "If you live with a cop."
You mean, if I live with a cop.
Me, right?
Have you thought about this at all?
I have a kid.
It's a whole family.
You get that, right?
I want to ask you something.
The singles magazine.
I don't know, you know?
I mean, the dates...
How can you do that shit?
I mean, you know, go out with guys like that.
How can you do that?
What do you mean? You do it.
Did you forget how we met?
What are you talking about?
I was on a job.
I mean, that was a job.
I was wearing a wire.
We were going to drop somebody.
I'd never do that for real.
The part about the wire.
You want to run that by me again?
- Let me just tell you...
- Fuck you!
Wait a minute, now.
I was just... Listen!
I was just saying that...
What're you having?
Double Dewar, Pete.
You got it.
Oh, hi. Is...
It's 1:00 a.m.
I'm Frank.
I know who you are.
My mouth ain't working so good tonight, so... all I can say right now is that... the circumstances... were the circumstances, and...
- No, that's not good enough.
- Okay.
The whole thing is horseshit.
Know what I mean?
The wire, the job.
There was no wire, there was no job, no nothing.
I was just saying that to push you away from me... because I was going to ask you to live with me.
And I got scared, you know?
I'm sorry.
You know... you never even told me... what your kid's name is.
Sarah.
I would like... for the three of us... you know... to go somewhere, a movie or something.
Just take it slow, you know?
Helen...
I can't even sleep in my own bed anymore unless you're in it.
I mean...
I need you to lie down with me.
Otherwise, I'm just going to walk the streets all night.
I'm so tired.
You gotta come lay down with me.
I got these shoes here.
See?
Come back with me, please.
Let me go tell my mother.
Frank, I didn't want to wake her up.
I think I need a little time to think all this through.
I think I should be alone tonight.
Okay.
Catch you later.
Sherman.
Frankie?
Yeah.
Frank?
I forgot you were here.
Scared the shit out of me.
I'm gonna stay on the couch.
- I thought you went to a hotel.
- No, it didn't work out.
What's he doing here?
Is this his place?
Look, I'll go to the station house.
No, listen, I gotta talk to you.
I never did nothing like this before.
That's okay.
No, listen.
I gotta talk to you about this.
None of this was my idea.
First Gina starts hitting on me, rubbing my leg under the table.
Then you threw the keys.
I told you not to throw me the keys.
You want to go get her?
Want me to get her?
I'm sorry, Sherman.
I'm sorry.
Take care.
"Catch you later"?
What's that supposed to mean?
Is that some kind of brush-off, Frank?
No, not at all.
No.
I got something for you.
Oh, yeah?
What?
You were looking at this like it rang some bells.
Want to dance?
Okay.
Got something for me?
You got something special for me tonight, huh?
Real special.
What do you got, Mummy?
Got something special for me?
Yeah, special.
What are you going to give me?
Find it.
Where's it at?
Find it.
Here?
Cut it out!
Let's see what we got here.
What?
Let's see.
What's this?
Why did you bring the fake one?
You forgot the real one?
Want to try mine?
You're crazy.
Come on. Let's get it over with.
I don't want to wait a couple more days.
Let's get it over with now. Bingo.
Just put the gun away, please.
Want to fuck first?
Then get me face down?
Just put the gun away, okay?
What kind of creep am I?
I'm the guy who fucks you once and wants to own you, right?
What about James Mackey?
What kind of creep was he?
Or that poor bastard in Queens?
What's his name? Raymond Brown.
You fucked him good.
You've been following me around?
Last chance.
How long have you been following me?
I haven't been following you.
Then how do you know about them?
It's my job. It's what I'm paid for.
I didn't sleep with any of them.
They were just dates.
- Shut up!
- Okay, I slept with James Mackey!
Big deal! He didn't mean anything!
I don't care!
Why'd you do it, Helen?
Tell me why you did it.
Tell me you did it.
Tell me why you did it.
I want to know everything, all right?
Come on. Talk to me.
Look. I'm wearing your shoes.
Talk to me. Come on.
Talk to me.
Look, the arresting officer was fucking the doer!
See? It's a joke.
It won't go to trial even.
You understand?
Talk to me. Come on.
Come on!
Helen.
Please.
Talk to me.
Get out.
Come on.
Go ahead.
Helen?
I know you!
You fucking swinging dick!
You got in deep, man!
She throws a court order at me, my family is up for grabs?
It's not your family!
It's not your daughter!
God!
Don't!
Go!
On the bed!
Get down on the bed, man.
Tell me, man, did you have a good time with her last night?
Who are you talking about?
Who? Are you a fucking owl?
I don't know who you're talking about.
I'm talking about my wife.
My wife, Helen.
You remember her, don't you?
I don't know.
I'm a New York City...
I know who the fuck you are.
You just show me how you did it to her!
I didn't do anything.
You know.
No, I didn't do anything.
You show me, I'll let you go.
I didn't do anything.
Show me what you did to her!
Show me!
I tell you, we didn't do anything.
Okay. Okay.
This? You mean this?
Okay?
Fucking bastard!
Get your fucking clothes off!
Take your fucking...
Don't fucking move!
Put it down!
On the floor!
Hands in back of the head! Come on.
Get them on there!
Don't fucking move!
Okay.
What are you going to do?
Lock me up and throw away the key?
Shut the fuck up!
Fuck you! It ain't going to work!
It's not your wife!
- It's not your family!
- What are you doing?
No!
I hadn't seen him in about a year.
I thought he was gone for good.
That's it. That's the stuff.
This one's on the house.
You don't want to get up.
- Come here.
- How you doing, sport?
- Good to see you.
- I'm doing better than you.
What are you drinking, scotch?
No. I think I'll have a club soda and lime.
Club soda and lime?
- You're a cheap date.
- It's the new me.
Here's to the new you, and the old me.
Rub it in, rub it in.
How you doing, Frank?
Hanging in, hanging out.
I'm with the 1-9 now.
Yeah?
You?
Same old, same old.
That was a hard job to top.
- I hear that.
- Wildest ride I was ever on.
You know, I followed up that nutbag.
The husband, Terry?
Turns out he'd been shadowing her for eight months.
Can you believe it?
Jesus.
She always had that edge, you know?
Like she smelled him, like she sensed him, or something.
I must have sensed him, too.
- Wonder what she ever saw in him.
- I don't know.
What does anybody see in anybody?
People are work, brother.
A lot of work.
- Too much work.
- Did you ever see her again after?
Well, I tried, but... she didn't want to.
Can you blame her?
I'm in bed with her, making love...
I'm out of bed,
I'm stalking her, like...
She had that nutcase over one shoulder... and me over the other.
Come on.
Can you blame her?
Yeah, right.
I'm going to let her go.
I ran her through a wringer, man.
You know?
What am I supposed to do?
She'd tear my head off.
What are you looking at?
How you doing?
Just great.
Good. How's your daughter?
She's fine.
Good, good.
I'm working out of the 1-9 now.
That's this area here.
We had a series of break-ins around here.
You've been all right, though?
Your shop's wired to the precinct?
Yeah.
Listen, the reason I come by is...
I wanted you to meet somebody.
"Who, Frank?" Well, actually...
I'd very much like to introduce myself to you.
Who are you this week, a fighter pilot?
Fighter pilot? No.
No more surprises.
No more lies.
I'm all here.
Right. The circumstances are no longer the circumstances?
I hung fire to be with you.
You don't know.
There's a lot I don't know.
You've got to give me a chance.
You never really got to know me.
Not 100 percent.
The person you got involved with, that was half of me.
You owe it to yourself.
Check out the complete person.
Cut the crap, okay?
Look, I had a rough day.
What am I gonna do, follow you all over the city?
How am I gonna get over with you now?
How are you gonna get over with me?
After what you did, you're looking to get over with me?
It couldn't be helped.
I couldn't help that.
It's killing me, not seeing you.
It's killing me.
How do you think it makes me feel?
I don't know. How does it...
- How does it make you feel?
- It doesn't make any difference.
I'm moving back home anyway.
Back to York?
That's fantastic.
Because just this morning...
I got offered a job in York, Pennsylvania.
Police department.
They want me to head this huge...
Break up this huge counterfeit produce ring.
Listen, this is fantastic, you know?
Look, I tell you what.
What?
I'll take the job now. All right?
Whatever.
You could help me out there.
Do you know any nice apartments, houses, stuff that I could...
- What about the guys...
- Okay, enough, Frank.
- Enough.
- No, really! When are you going?
You're not going?
You're staying here, right?
I've been on the wagon... for seven weeks now.
You still drink coffee?
Like it's going out of style.
I'll buy you a cup if you like.
- Ready? You have your instructions.
- Oui, monsieur.
Everything all right, Mrs Ho?
Dinner will be ready at 7.30.
- Good evening.
- I don't know if...
You are expected, Colonel.
May I take your coat?
- It is Colonel Mustard?
- No, that's not my name...
Tonight, you may well feel obliged to my employer for the use of an alias.
- And who are you?
- Wadsworth, sir. The butler.
Yvette, give the Colonel anything he requires.
Within reason, that is.
Wadsworth, I was...
Come in, madam. You are expected.
- You know who I am?
- You are to be known as Mrs White.
Yes, it said so in the letter. But why?
May I introduce you?
Mrs White, this is Yvette, the maid.
I see you know each other.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Want a lift?
- Yes, please!
- Thanks. I'm late for a dinner date.
- Me too. Where are you going?
Let's see... hill house, off route 41.
Wait, let me look. That's where I'm going.
I got a letter like this.
- And this is Mrs Peacock.
- How do you do?
Yvette, check dinner will be ready as soon as all the guests have arrived.
- Is this the address for Mr Boddy?
- You must be Mr Green.
Sit!
No... not you, sir.
It should be just off there.
That must be it.
- Why has the car stopped?
- It's frightened.
What a God-forsaken place!
Professor Plum! Miss Scarlet!
- I didn't know you were acquainted.
- We weren't.
May I present Professor Plum and miss Scarlet?
You've each been addressed by a pseudonym.
Nobody here is being addressed by their real name.
Ah, dinner.
I'm sorry. I'm a little accident-prone.
You'll find your names beside your places. Please be seated.
- Is this place yours?
- No, sir. I'm a butler.
- What exactly do you do?
- I buttle, sir.
The butler is head of the kitchen and dining-room. I keep things tidy.
What's all this about, this dinner party?
Ours not to reason why, ours but to do and die.
- Die?
- Merely quoting Tennyson, sir.
I prefer Kipling. "The female of the species is more deadly than the male."
- You like Kipling?
- I'll eat anything.
Soup.
- For our host?
- For the seventh guest, Mr Boddy.
- I thought Mr Boddy was our host.
- So did I.
So, who is our host, Mr Wadsworth?
- I want to start.
- Wait for the other guest.
- I'll keep something warm for him.
- What did you have in mind?
Well, someone's got to break the ice, so why not me?
I'm often a hostess, for my husband's work.
It's always hard, when new friends meet for the first time, to get acquainted, so I'm prepared to start the ball roiling.
I have no idea why we're here, why I'm here, what this place is about, but I am determined to enjoy myself.
I'm very intrigued, and this soup's delicious, isn't it?
You are often a hostess for your husband?
Yes, it's an integral part of your life when you are the wife of a...
I forgot, we mustn't say who we are, though I don't know why.
- Don't you?
- I know who you are.
- Will you tell?
- How do you know?
I work in Washington, too.
- So you're a politician's wife?
- Yes, I am.
Come on, then. Who's your husband?
- So what does your husband do?
- Nothing.
- He lies around on his back all day.
- Sounds like hard work to me.
I'm sorry!
- I'm a little accident-prone.
- Watch it.
Excusez-moi.
- This is one of my favourite recipes.
- I know, madam.
What do you do in Washington DC,
Mr Green?
Come on! How can we get acquainted if we say nothing about ourselves?
Perhaps he doesn't want to.
I don't know, but if I wasn't making conversation we'd be sitting here in an embarrassed silence.
- Are you afraid of silence?
- Yes... no... why?
You seem to suffer from what we call
"pressure of speech".
Who's "we"? Are you a shrink?
I do know a little about psychological medicine, yes.
- A doctor?
- But I don't practise.
Practice makes perfect. Most men need a little practice, don't you think?
- So what do you do?
- I work for the united nations.
Another politician!
I work for a branch of the UNO,
WHO, the World Health Organisation.
- What is your area of concern?
- Family planning.
- Are you a real colonel?
- I am, sir.
You're not going to mention you also live in Washington DC?
How did you know that?
Have we met before?
I've seen you before.
You may not have seen me.
- Do you live in Washington, too?
- I sure do.
- Does anyone not live in Washington?
- I don't.
But you work for the united nations, a government job.
Anyone not earn their living from the government?
Where's our host and why have we been brought here?
Good evening.
You are eagerly awaited.
- Locking me in? I'll take the key.
- Over my dead body, sir.
- May I take your bag?
- No.
- It contains evidence?
- Surprises, that's what it contains.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present Mr Boddy?
- What are they doing here?
- Eating dinner.
- Do sit down, Mr Boddy.
- Thanks.
No, you can take that away, honey.
I demand to know what's going on.
Why have we been dragged here?
Well, I believe we all received a letter.
My letter says, "it will be to your advantage to be present,
"because a Mr Boddy will end a certain long-standing, painful, financial liability."
- Signed, "a friend."
- I got a similar letter.
- So did we, didn't we?
- I also received a letter.
- No, Yvette. I just ate.
- You know her?
We know each other, don't we, dear?
Forgive me, but was your letter the same?
- No.
- I see.
Can I interest any of you in fruit, or dessert?
I suggest we adjourn for coffee and brandy, when I believe our unknown host will reveal his intentions.
- There's no one here.
- Please help yourselves and be seated.
Mind if I smoke?
I'm instructed to explain to you what you all have in common, unless you would care to do the honours,
Mr Boddy?
- Why? They know who I am?
- I don't think so.
- It's a hoax. I suggest we all leave.
- You cannot leave this house!
- No? Who's gonna stop me?
- There's no way out.
The windows and doors are locked.
- Outrageous! You can't imprison us!
- Ladies and gentlemen!
Please return to the study.
Everything will be explained.
You too, Mr Boddy.
The other way!
- You can't go that way.
- It's only glass.
You all have one thing in common.
You're all being blackmailed.
You have all been paying money to someone who threatens to expose you.
And none of you know who's blackmailing you.
Please! That's ridiculous.
Nobody could blackmail me.
My life is an open book.
I've never done anything wrong.
Anybody else wish to deny it?
As everyone's in the same boat, there's no harm in revealing details.
And my instructions are to do so.
Thank you, Yvette.
- Can't you spare us this humiliation?
- I'm sorry.
Professor Plum.
You were a psychiatry Professor, helping paranoid, homicidal lunatics with delusions of grandeur.
- Now I work for the UN.
- The same job.
You don't practise medicine.
- His licence has been lifted.
- Why? What did he do?
You know what doctors mustn't do with patients? He did.
- How disgusting!
- Are you making moral judgements?
Can you justify taking bribes, for handing your husband's vote to lobbyists?
- Nothing wrong with paid consultancy.
- Not if it's publicly declared.
But what if it's used greenbacks slipped under the door of the men's room?
- It stinks.
- Were you in the men's room?
- It's true?
- It's a vicious lie.
I'm sure we're glad to hear that.
But you've paid blackmail for over a year to keep it out of the papers.
I'm being blackmailed for something I didn't do.
Me too.
- Not me.
- No?
I'm being blackmailed, but I did what I'm being blackmailed for.
What did you do?
I run a service providing gentlemen with the company of a young lady.
Oh, yeah?
What's the phone number?
You knew the Colonel works in Washington. Is he a client?
- No!
- I asked miss Scarlet.
- Say it's not true.
- It's not.
- True?
- No.
- It is true!
- A double negative!
- You have photos?
- Sounds like a confession.
The double negative has led to proof positive.
Trying to make me look stupid?
- You don't need any help from me.
- Right!
What's so terrible about the Colonel visiting a house of ill fame?
- Most soldiers do.
- Please!
He holds a sensitive post in the Pentagon.
You drive a very expensive car for a colonel.
I came into money during the war when I lost my parents.
Mrs White, you've been paying since your husband died under mysterious circumstances.
- Why is that funny?
- That's why he's on his back. In a coffin.
- I didn't kill him.
- So why pay the blackmailer?
I don't want a scandal. We'd had a very humiliating confrontation.
He was deranged. He was lunatic.
He didn't like me.
He threatened to kill me in public.
- Why kill you in public?
- He threatened, in public, to kill her.
- Was that his final word?
- Being killed is pretty final.
- Yet he was the one who died, not you.
- What did he do for a living?
A scientist. Nuclear physics.
What was he like?
A stupidly optimistic man.
It came as a shock to him when he died.
He was found at home, his head had been cut off and his...
You know...
- I'd been at the movies.
- Miss him?
It's life after death.
Now he's dead, I have a life.
- Your first husband also disappeared.
- That was his job. An illusionist.
- But he never reappeared.
- He wasn't a very good illusionist.
I have something to say.
I'm not going to wait for Wadsworth to unmask me.
I work for the state department.
And I'm a homosexual.
I feel no personal shame or guilt about this.
But I must keep it a secret or I'll lose my job on security grounds.
Thank you.
Well...
- That just leaves Mr Boddy.
- What's your little secret?
His secret? Hadn't you guessed?
He's your blackmailer.
- You bastard!
- Colonel!
Put 'em up!
- Gentlemen!
- If you can't fight fairly, don't fight.
He called me a bastard!
- Was that necessary, Mrs White?
- Wait! The police are coming.
- Oh, no!
- My career is very sensitive...
Listen! Blackmail depends on secrecy.
You admit he's blackmailing you.
Tell the police, convict him, and it will be over.
It's not so easy.
You'll never tell the police.
I shall. I have evidence, and this conversation is being recorded.
- Recordings aren't admissible evidence.
- Ladies and gentlemen!
The police will be here in about 45 minutes.
Tell them the truth and Mr Boddy will be behind bars.
- Where are you going?
- I can help them decide.
I'll get my bag.
- Who can guess what's in here?
- The evidence against us, no doubt.
- Did you know you'd see us tonight?
- Yes.
- What were you told?
- That you'd be discussing our little deal.
And if I didn't appear,
Wadsworth would tell the police about it.
Naturally, I could hardly resist putting in an appearance.
Excuse me.
- Open 'em.
- Why not?
I enjoy getting presents from strange men.
A candlestick? What's this for?
In your hands, you each have a lethal weapon.
If you denounce me to the police, you will also be exposed and humiliated.
I'll see to that in court.
But... if one of you kills Wadsworth now, no one but the seven of us will ever know.
He has the key to the front door...
...which he said would only be opened over his dead body.
I suggest we take him up on that offer.
The only way to stay off the front pages is for one of you to kill Wadsworth...
Now!
- It's not Wadsworth!
- Is he alive?
Stand back! Give him air. Let me see...
He's dead.
- Who had the gun?
- Me, but I didn't shoot.
You had the gun.
If you didn't, who did?
Nobody! No gunshot wound! Somebody grabbed the gun and it went off.
Look, the bullet broke that vase on the mantle.
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.
He's right.
There's a bullet hole in the wall.
- How did he die?
- I don't know. I'm not a forensic expert.
- One of us must have killed him.
- I didn't.
I need a drink!
Maybe he was poisoned!
Mrs Peacock, please. It's all right.
We don't know anything.
Sit down. Sit down, Mrs...
I... had to stop her from screaming.
- But was the brandy poisoned?
- I don't...
- Looks like we'll never know.
- Unless... unless she dies too.
- It's locked.
- Open up!
- The murderer!
- Screaming?
- It must be Yvette.
- Oh, my God!
- You're alive!
- No thanks to you.
- You locked me up with a murderer!
- The murderer is in this room?
- Where?
- Where? Here!
We are looking at him, or her. As
Mrs White said, one of you is the killer.
- How do you know?
- I was listening.
- But why were you screaming in here?
- I am frightened.
I also drink the cognac. Mon dieu,
I can't stay in here by myself.
- Come with us.
- With the murderer?
There is safety in numbers, my dear.
- No clue how he died?
- No.
This is absolutely terrible.
It's not what I intended. Oh, my God!
- Not what you intended?
- You're not the butler?
Not the butler, but a butler.
In fact, I was his butler.
If he invited us, why was he late?
I invited you. I wrote the letters.
It was all my idea.
Wait a minute. I don't understand.
Why invite us?
Were you helping him blackmail us?
- Certainly not!
- You had better explain.
Please sit down, everyone.
When I said I was Mr Boddy's butler, it was true but misleading.
I was once his butler. But it was not his death that ended my employment.
- When did it end?
- When my wife decided to end her life.
She too was being blackmailed by this odious man who lies dead.
He hated my wife for the same reason he hated you.
He believed you were all thoroughly UN-American.
- Sorry.
- He felt it was inappropriate for a senator to have a corrupt wife, a doctor to take advantage of patients, for a wife to emasculate her husband and... so forth...
It's ridiculous. Why didn't he report us to the authorities?
He decided to use his information to make some money - very American!
- What was your role?
- I was a victim, too.
At least, my wife was.
She had friends who were...
- Socialists!
- Oh, my God!
Well, we all make mistakes.
He threatened to report her unless she named her friends.
She refused, so he blackmailed her.
We had no money.
The price of his silence was that we work for nothing, like slaves.
- To make a long story short...
- Too late!
The suicide of my wife created a sense of injustice in me.
I resolved to put Mr Boddy in jail.
It seemed the best way to do it, and free you from blackmail too, was to get everyone face to face, confront Mr Boddy with his crimes, and turn him over to the police.
- So, everything is explained.
- We still don't know who killed him.
We have to find out before the police arrive.
- We can't have the police now!
- How can we know which of you did it?
- Why "which of you"?
- I didn't.
All of us had the opportunity and a motive.
- Great!
- Maybe it wasn't one of us.
- Who else?
- Who else is here?
- The cook...
- The cook!
Well, she's not here.
I didn't do it!
Would somebody help me, please?
Help me, please!
- Don't touch it, it's evidence.
- We have to find out who did this.
- You'd better explain yourself.
- Me? Why?
- Why kill the cook?
- Dinner was OK.
- How can you make jokes?
- It's my defence mechanism.
Some defence!
If I was the killer, I'd kill you next.
I said "if"...!
- The only admitted killer here is her.
- I've admitted nothing.
- How many husbands have you had?
- Mine?
- Yours.
- Five, just five.
Husbands are like Kleenex, soft, strong, disposable.
You lure them like a spider with flies.
- Flies are where men are vulnerable.
- Right.
If it wasn't you, who was it?
Who had the dagger? Mrs Peacock!
- I put it down, in the study.
- When?
I don't know...
Before I fainted, after I fainted.
But any of you could have picked it up.
I suggest we take the cook's body into the study.
- Why?
- I'm the butler. I keep the kitchen tidy.
Look! The body's gone!
- What are you staring at? Who's there?
- Nobody.
- What do you mean?
- No body. Mr Boddy's body has gone.
Maybe he wasn't dead.
We should have made sure.
- By cutting his head off?
- Really!
- Where is he?
- We'd better look for him.
Well...
- He couldn't have been dead.
- He was! At least, I thought he was.
- What's the difference?
- Quite a difference to him.
- Maybe there is life after death.
- As improbable as sex after marriage.
- Maybe Mr Boddy killed the cook!
- Yes!
How?
If you'll excuse me...
Is there a little girl's room?
- Oui, oui, madame.
- No, I just want to powder my nose.
What's this?
- The negatives the Colonel referred to.
- My God!
- Planning to blackmail him?
- Certainly not!
I was going to give them to the Colonel once Mr Boddy was unmasked.
Very pretty! Want to see?
They might shock you.
- No, I am a lady.
- So how d'you know what they're like?
- What are they like?
- I'd like them back.
- Something in them concerns me, too.
- Let me see.
- My! Nobody can get into that position.
- Sure they can. Let me show you.
Get off!
Mr Boddy! He's attacking her.
- No, he's dead.
- Mr Boddy, dead? Again?!
- Oh, my God!
- She's fainting.
- Catch her!
- I'll catch her. Fall into my arms.
- Sorry.
- You've got blood on your hands.
I didn't do it!
He's got new injuries.
He's dead now.
Why kill him twice?
- Unnecessary.
- What we call "overkill".
- Psychotic.
- Unless he wasn't dead.
- So what?
- That's what we want to find out!
- Who killed him, where, and with what.
- No need to shout.
I'm not shouting!
All right, I am.
I'm shouting, I'm shouting...
OK, put the corpses on the sofa.
Ladies first.
- Don't get blood on the sofa.
- The dagger will go further into her back.
Tip her forward, over the arm.
Now Mr Boddy.
Ready...
- A little higher.
- There you go.
Now... who...
- Who had the candlestick?
- It was given to you.
I dropped it.
Anyone could've picked it up.
We have all these weapons, the gun, the rope, the wrench, the lead pipe.
Let's lock them all in this cupboard.
There's a homicidal maniac about.
- That's wise.
- Good idea.
- Why are you pocketing the key?
- To keep it safe.
That means you can open it.
What if you're the murderer?
- I'm not.
- What if you are?
It has to go somewhere.
I know I'm safe.
We don't!
- I have an idea. We'll throw it away.
- Good idea.
- Brilliant.
- That'll do it.
Sorry...
Sorry... can we help?
I didn't mean to disturb the whole household.
My car broke down and I was wondering if I could use your phone.
Just a moment.
Very well, sir.
Would you care to come in?
- Well, where is it?
- The body?
- The phone. What body?
- No body. Nobody in the study.
- No!
- But there's a phone in the lounge.
Thank you.
- When you've finished, please wait here.
- Certainly.
- Where's the key?
- The key to the weapons cupboard.
- You still wish me to throw it away?
- Yes!
Well... what now?
- Wadsworth, let me out.
- No, we've got to know who did it.
- If you go, I'll say you killed them both.
- Me too.
I'll make you sorry you started this, one day when we're alone.
No sane man would be alone with you.
- I could use a drink.
- So could I.
Just checking...
Two corpses, everything's fine.
- Anybody else want a whisky?
- Yeah.
All right, look. Pay attention, everybody.
Am I right that there is nobody else here?
- No.
- There is someone else.
- No, I said no meaning yes.
- No meaning yes?
I want a straight answer.
Is there someone else? Yes or no?
- No.
- "No, there is", or "No, there isn't"?
- Yes.
- Please!
Shouldn't we get rid of that man before he finds out what's going on?
- We can't throw him out.
- If he stays, he'll get suspicious.
- If he goes, he'll be suspicious.
- I'd be suspicious.
Who cares? Let him stay locked up for another half an hour.
The police will be here by then, and there are two dead bodies in the study!
There's confusion as to whether there's anyone else here.
- There isn't.
- Confusion or anybody else?
- Either. Or both.
- Gimme a clear answer.
- Certainly. The question?
- Is anybody else here?
- No!
- So he says. But does he know?
I suggest we do this in military fashion.
We split up and search the house.
- Split up?!
- Yes.
We have very little time, so we'll split into pairs.
What if one of us is the murderer?
Whoever is left with the killer might get killed.
- Then we'll discover the murderer.
- But one of the pair will be dead!
This is war, Peacock!
Casualties are inevitable.
Making omelettes means breaking eggs, every cook knows.
Look what happened to the cook!
- Will you take that chance?
- What choice have we?
- None.
- You're right.
Bon, d'accord. But it is dark upstairs.
Will anyone go with me?
- I will.
- No, thank you.
I suggest we all draw lots, for partners.
Ready? The two shortest together, the next two shortest together. Agreed?
I suggest the two shortest search the cellar and so on, up.
It's you and me, honey-bunch.
The cellar.
We know what's in the study and the library.
- The stranger's in the lounge.
- Let's go with the billiard-room.
- Want to go in front?
- Absolutely no.
- I'm sure there's no one there.
- Then you go.
All right.
- Well, ladies first.
- No, you can go first.
- I insist.
- I insist.
- Afraid of a fate worse than death?
- Just death.
- Are you going in there?
- Yes.
- Right.
- Right.
- I see no light switches.
- Nor do I. There must be some.
- Shall I come with you?
- No!
I mean... no, thank you.
- Ladies first.
- No, thanks.
- Go on, I'll be right behind you.
- That's why I'm nervous.
Then we go together.
Stay there!
If there's anybody in here, just look out!
Are you hiding? I'm coming!
- What room's this?
- Search me.
- All right.
- Get your mitts off me.
- Nobody here.
- He's behind one of those curtains.
You look. I'll search the kitchen.
I'm a little nervous.
I'm in this big house, and I've been locked into the lounge.
Yes...
The funny thing is, there's a group of people here having a sort of party.
And one of them is my old boss from...
Looks like a secret passage.
- Shall we see where it leads?
- What the hell?
I'll go first. I've had a good life.
- Oh, God!
- It's all right.
Oh, my God!
Come on! We're locked in here!
Help!
Down here! Get us out of here!
- Where's it coming from?
- Where are we going?
- Where are they?
- The lounge.
We're in here!
- The door's locked!
- I know!
- Where's the key?
- It's gone!
- Never mind, unlock the door!
- I can't unlock it without the key!
- Let us in!
- Let us out!
It's no good. Stand back.
There's no alternative.
I'll just have to break it down.
- I know, I have it!
- Help!
Will you shut up? We're doing our best!
They're shooting at us.
- I've been shot!
- Come out! The door is open!
- Why are you shooting at us?
- To get you out.
You could have killed us.
I could've been killed.
I can't take any more scares.
Look!
- Which one of you did it?
- We found him, together.
- How did you get in?
- There's a secret passage.
Is that the same gun?
The cupboard was locked!
- Unlocked.
- Unlocked?
See for yourself.
How did you know you could get at the gun?
I didn't. I think I break it open, but it was open already.
A likely story.
Maybe they'll just go away.
- I'm going to open it.
- Why?
I have nothing to hide, I didn't do it!
The key.
Thank you.
Good evening, sir.
- Yes?
- I found an abandoned car at the gate.
- Did the driver come in here for help?
- No.
- Well, actually, yes.
- No!
- Seems to be some disagreement.
- No!
Yes.
- Can I come in and use your phone?
- Of course, sir.
You may use the one in the... no...
You could use the one in the St... No...
Would you be kind enough to wait in... in the library?
Sure.
Don't I know you from someplace?
You all seem very anxious.
The chandelier fell and almost killed us.
Would you come this way?
Frightfully draughty, these old houses.
Please help yourself to a drink, if you'd like.
- Not the cognac, just in case.
- In case of what?
What now?
- We should've told.
- You say that now.
- I said it then.
- Oh, shut up!
Let's clean this up.
Hello?
- Maybe the cop answered it.
- And who shall I say is calling?
Would you hold on, please?
Let me outta here!
You have no right to shut me in.
I'll book you for false arrest, wrongful imprisonment, and obstructing an officer in the course of his duty and murder.
What do you mean, "murder"?
I just said it so you'd open the door.
What's going on?
Why lock me in? Why are you getting calls from J Edgar Hoover?
- J Edgar Hoover?
- That's right. The head of the FBI!
- Why is he on your phone?
- He's on everyone's. Why not mine?
Excuse me.
- What's going on here?
- We're having a party.
- Mind if I look around?
- Sure!
- You can show him around, Mr Green.
- Me?
Yes, you can show him the dining-room, the kitchen, the ballroom...
Fine!
Fine. Officer, come with me.
I'll show you the dining-room or the kitchen or the ballroom...
Make it look convincing.
- So, this is the dining-room.
- No kidding!
Come on!
- What's going on in those two rooms?
- Which two rooms?
- Those two rooms.
- Oh, those two rooms!
Yes.
- Officer, you shouldn't go in there.
- Why not?
Because it's all too shocking.
It's not all that shocking.
These folks are just having a good time.
My God!
Excuse me.
- This man's drunk. Dead drunk.
- Dead right!
- You're not going to drive home?
- He won't drive, I promise you.
- He'll get a lift?
- We'll get him a car.
- A long black car.
- A limousine.
- Officer!
- I've seen it all.
- I can explain everything.
- You don't have to.
- Don't worry, it's nothing illegal.
- Are you sure?
- This is America.
- I see.
- It's a free country.
- I didn't know it was that free.
- May I use your phone now?
- Certainly.
Why lock him in?
We haven't finished searching the house yet!
- Only 15 minutes till the police come.
- They already came!
- Shut up!
- Let's get on with it.
Look! I can't believe it.
I wonder where this one goes?
Let's find out.
Let's try the ballroom again.
Don't you touch me!
Hello?
Shut the door.
Did anyone recognise you?
They must have. And not just my face.
They know every inch of my body.
And they're not the only ones.
It's you!
There's something funny going on around here, I don't know what it is.
No, I'm not on duty.
But I have a feeling that I'm in danger.
You know that big, ugly house...
Hello?
Hello?
Are you there?
I am
your singing telegram!
I'm coming!
I'm just trying to find the door.
- Help me, please!
- Coming.
What's this? Another door?
Two murders.
- Neither was shot. I heard a gun.
- So did I.
- I heard the front door slam.
- The murderer must have run out.
- Three murders.
- Six altogether.
This is getting serious.
No gun. Yvette dropped it here.
- Very well. I know who did it.
- You do?
Furthermore, I'm going to tell you how it was done.
Follow me.
To help you understand, I shall take you through the events step by step.
At the start, Yvette was here by herself, waiting to offer you champagne.
I was in the hall.
I know, I was there.
Then I hurried across to the kitchen.
The cook was in here, alive, sharpening knives.
And then...
The doorbell rang...
It was you. I asked for your coat and stopped you from saying your name as I wanted you to use pseudonyms.
I introduced myself as the butler, and I ran across the hall to the library.
Then Yvette met you, and smiled, and poured you a drink.
The doorbell rang. It was Mrs White.
I took her coat and hung it up.
I introduced Mrs White to Colonel Mustard, and I noticed that Mrs White and Yvette flinched.
There was a rumble of thunder and a crash of lightning.
- In short...
- Too late!
You all arrived.
Then the gong was struck by the cook and we went into the dining-room.
Mrs Peacock sat here,
Professor Plum here.
Mrs White, Mr Green, miss Scarlet, Colonel Mustard.
This chair was vacant. Anyway, we all revealed we'd had a letter...
- Get on with it!
- The point is, blackmail.
- All this came out in the study.
- You're right.
Mr green stood here, Mrs Peacock here, miss Scarlet, Professor Plum, Colonel...
- Get on with it!
- I'm getting there!
Mr Boddy got packages from the hall, you opened your presents,
Mr Boddy switched out the lights...
- Oh, my God.
- Grand!
- Mr Boddy lay apparently dead.
- He was dead!
So why was he bashed with a candlestick?
- OK, I made a mistake!
- Right.
But why did Mr Boddy pretend he was dead?
Because he realised his scheme had misfired.
The gunshot was intended to kill him, not me.
The bullet grazed him. He escaped death by pretending to be dead already.
Whoever grabbed the gun was trying to kill him!
What happened next?
Mrs Peacock took a drink.
You said, "maybe it's poisoned."
She screams.
We took her to the sofa...
Mr green...
Well, I had to stop her screaming...
Then more screaming. Yvette!
We all rushed to the billiard-room.
- But one of us wasn't here. No.
- No?
No. Maybe one of us was murdering the cook.
- Who wasn't here with us?
- Do you know?
I do. While we stood here, trying to stop Yvette from panicking, one of us could have taken the dagger, run down the hall, and stabbed the cook.
- We'd have seen them run back.
- Not if they used this secret passage.
And the murderer ran down the passage to the study.
- Is that where it comes out?
- Yes, look.
- How did you know?
- This house belongs to a friend.
- You could be the murderer.
- Ridiculous!
If I was the murderer, why would I tell you how I did it?
- Who else knew of the passage?
- Me and the Colonel found it.
- You could've known all along.
- Why should we believe you?
She was with us while Yvette was screaming, remember?
Why was the cook murdered?
She had nothing to do with Mr Boddy.
She did! I gathered you here because you were all implicated in his blackmail.
Did none of you deduce that the others were involved, too?
- Who?
- The cook and Yvette.
- No!
- That's how he got his information.
Before blackmailing anyone, he had to discover their secret.
The cook and Yvette were accomplices.
I see. So, whoever knew that the cook was involved...
...killed her?
- Yes.
I know, as Mr Boddy's butler, that the cook worked for one of you.
- Who?
- You recognised Yvette. Don't deny it.
- What do you mean? I deny nothing.
- Another denial.
OK, I knew Yvette. My husband had an affair with her. I didn't care.
- You knew Yvette.
- She worked for me.
You also knew her.
You were one of miss Scarlet's clients.
That's why you wanted those photos.
You and Yvette in flagrante delicto.
Mr Boddy threatened to send them to my mother. It would've killed her.
Amazing, since you told us she's dead already. So, he had the motive.
- You all did.
- Where and when was Mr Boddy killed?
Don't you see? We came back from the study. Mr Boddy was on the floor, pretending to be dead.
One of us knows he's alive.
I said I'd invited you and we realised there was only one other person here.
The cook!
Where is he?
She was dead. We laid her down, our backs to the freezer.
- One of us went through the passage...
- Again?
...back to the study.
The murderer was in the passage.
Mr Boddy had been on the floor.
He jumped up...
The murderer came out, picked up the candlestick...
Mr Boddy followed us into the hall, the murderer crept up behind him...
- And killed him!
- Will you stop that?
No.
Then he threw him into the toilet.
And joined us in the kitchen.
It took half a minute.
- So who wasn't in the kitchen?
- That is the murderer.
We put the weapons in here, locked it, and ran to the door to throw away the key.
The motorist!
I put the key in my pocket. Someone could have swapped it for another.
- It could have been any one of us.
- Precisely.
Wait a minute...
Colonel Mustard has a top secret job,
Mrs White's husband was a nuclear physicist, and...
Yvette is a link between them.
- What is your job, Colonel?
- I can tell you.
He's working on the next fusion bomb.
- How did you know?
- Keep a secret? Me too.
Was this a plot?
Or did Colonel Mustard do it alone?
We'll see.
Let's look at the other murders.
- Bad luck the motorist arrived.
- No luck. I invited him.
- You did?
- It's obvious.
Everyone was Mr Boddy's victim or accomplice.
Everyone who died gave him information about one of you.
I got them here to force him to confess.
What about that motorist?
What information did he have?
- He was my driver during the war.
- What was he holding over you?
He knew that I was a war profiteer.
I stole essential air force radio parts and sold them on the black market.
That's how I made my money.
It doesn't make me a murderer.
A lot of our airmen died because their radios didn't work.
Was the policeman working for Mr Boddy, too?
The cop was from Washington, on my payroll.
I bribed him so I could carry on with business. Mr Boddy found out.
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, please!
And the singing telegram girl?
She was my patient once.
I had an affair with her.
That's how I lost my licence.
Mr Boddy found that out, too.
Let's put her in the study with the others.
So, now you all know why they died.
Whoever killed Mr Boddy wanted his accomplices dead.
How did the murderer know?
I guessed that the singer informed on me to Mr Boddy, but I knew nothing of you until now.
The murderer needed to get the weapons and stole the key from my pocket.
Then Colonel Mustard suggested we search the house.
That's right! It was his suggestion.
One of us slipped away and hurried to the study.
On the desk was the envelope containing photos and letters, the evidence of Mr Boddy's informants.
- Where's the envelope now?
- Gone.
Destroyed. Perhaps in the fire, the only possible place.
Aha...! Then the murderer went to the cupboard, unlocked it, took the wrench...
Then we found the passage to the lounge and found the motorist dead.
That's right! We couldn't get in, so we went back, got the gun and shot the door open, bang! And then the doorbell rang.
Whoever it is must go away or they'll be killed.
Have you ever thought about the kingdom of heaven?
- What?
- The kingdom of heaven is at hand.
- You ain't kiddin'
- Armageddon is almost upon us.
- It's already here!
- Go away!
- Your souls are in danger.
- Our lives are in danger, you beatnik!
The cop came, we put him in the library.
We forgot the open cupboard, split up.
And the murderer switched off the electricity.
- Oh, my God!
- Turn on the lights!
- Didn't mean to frighten you.
- Bit late for that... I hate that!
Then came three more murders.
None of us killed Mr Boddy or the cook.
- So who did?!
- The one person who wasn't with us.
- Yvette.
- Yvette!
She was listening to us. She heard the shot and thought he was dead.
While we examined the bullet-hole, she got the dagger, ran to the kitchen, and stabbed the cook. We heard nothing because Mrs Peacock was screaming.
Yvette returned, screamed and we ran to her.
- When did she kill Mr Boddy?
- When I said.
We ran to see the cook. Yvette checked that Mr Boddy was dead.
He followed into the hall, she hit him on the head and dragged him to the toilet.
- Why?
- To create confusion.
- It worked.
- Why did she do it?
Was she obeying orders from the person who later killed her?
- Who?
- Who?
Who?
Was it one of her clients?
Or was it a jealous wife?
Or an adulterous doctor?
- No, it was her employer, miss Scarlet.
- That's a lie.
Is it? You used her the way you always used her.
You killed the motorist.
- How did I know about the passage?
- Yvette told you.
When we split up again, you switched off the electricity.
You got the lead pipe and the rope, strangled Yvette, ran to the library, killed the cop, picked up the gun, opened the door, recognised the singer from her photo, and shot her.
- You've no proof.
- The gun is missing.
Gentlemen, turn out your pockets.
Ladies, empty your purses.
Whoever has the gun is the murderer.
Brilliant! I congratulate you.
- Me too!
- Shut up!
- One thing I don't understand.
- One thing?
Why? Half of Washington knows your business.
You were in no danger. The whole town would be implicated with you.
They don't know that my real business is secrets.
And Yvette found them out for me.
The secrets of Senator Peacock's defence committee,
Colonel Mustard's fusion bomb,
Professor Plum's UN contacts, and the work of your husband, the nuclear physicist.
So, it is political. You're a communist!
No, Mr Green.
Communism is just a red herring.
Like all prostitutes, I'm a capitalist and I'm going to sell my secrets, your secrets, to the highest bidder.
- What if we don't cooperate?
- You will, or I'll expose you.
- We could expose you. Six murders...
- It won't help your reputation at the UN.
You're implicated not only in adultery with a patient but in her death.
- And the deaths of five others.
- You don't know the UN, it might help.
- It's no good, I've no more money.
- Neither do I.
I know. But you can pay me in government information, all of you.
Except you, Wadsworth.
As a butler, you have no access to government secrets.
So, I'm afraid your moment has come.
- Not so fast! I do have a secret or two.
- Such as?
Game's up.
There are no bullets in that gun.
- I'm not falling for that trick.
- It's no trick.
One for Boddy, two for the chandelier, two at the door and one for the singer.
- That's not six.
- One plus two plus two plus one.
One for the chandelier.
One plus two plus one plus one.
That's one plus one plus two plus one.
Not one plus two plus one plus one.
One plus two plus... shut up!
The point is, there's one bullet, and guess who's gonna get it?
I'm only a guest!
Where's the chief?
Well done, Wadsworth.
I warned you. Mr Hoover is an expert on Armageddon.
Don't hate me for trying to shoot you.
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn.
There are no bullets in this gun.
One plus two... plus one...
Plus two, plus one... is...
In the dark, the murderer ran to the study, got the rope and lead pipe, ran to the billiard-room, strangled Yvette...
Ran to the library, hit the cop.
The doorbell, it was the singing telegram.
The murderer picked up the gun, ran to the door, recognised and shot the girl.
- Then ran back to the cellar.
- The cellar!
- Colonel Mustard wasn't in the cellar!
- No... but you were!
So?
You were missing when the cook and Mr Boddy died.
The cook used to be your cook.
Remember your fatal mistake?
You told us at dinner we were eating your favourite dish.
Monkey's brains, though popular in Cantonese cuisine, are not often found in Washington DC.
Is that what we ate?
- Why murder the others?
- In case Mr Boddy'd told them of you.
It was nothing to do with a nuclear physicist and the fusion bomb?
No, communism was a red herring.
Mrs Peacock did it all.
- There's no proof.
- The gun is missing.
Gentlemen, turn out your pockets.
Ladies, empty your purses.
Whoever has the gun is the murderer.
Very well.
What do you propose to do about it?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
Nothing. I don't approve of murder, but you've done the world a service by ridding it of a blackmailer and his informers.
- The police will be here any minute.
- Why? Nobody's called them.
- You mean?
- That's right!
I suggest we stack the bodies in the cellar, lock it, leave quietly one at a time and pretend none of this ever happened.
Great idea! I'll leave first, if you don't mind.
Be my guest. In fact, I think we all owe you a vote of thanks.
For she's a jolly good fellow
for she's a jolly good fellow
for she's a jolly good fellow
which nobody can deny
which nobody can deny
which nobody can deny
for she's a jolly good fellow
for she's a jolly good fellow
for she's a jolly...
- I said I didn't do it!
- What if the authorities find out?
- The FBI will take care of that.
- You mean...
Mr Hoover? I work for him, of course.
How else could I know all about you?
- One thing I don't understand.
- One thing?
Who was bribing Mrs Peacock?
A foreign power.
Her husband handles defence contracts.
- Will there be a cover-up?
- Yes, what's to be gained by exposure?
Do the FBI clean up after multiple murder?
Yes. Why do you think it's run by a man called Hoover?
Mrs Peacock?
- How did you know my name?
- The kingdom of heaven is at hand.
OK, take her away.
Take your hands off me.
I'm a senator's wife!
Wadsworth, we got her.
See? Like the mounties, we always get our man.
Mrs Peacock was a man?
Would anyone care for fruit, or dessert?
- Didn't mean to frighten anyone.
- Bit late for that!
- Then three more murders.
- So who did it?!
Let's consider each murder one by one.
Professor Plum, you knew Mr Boddy was still alive.
Even psychiatrists can tell if patients are alive or dead.
You fired the gun in the dark, missed, and pretended he was dead.
You were able to kill him later, unobserved.
He was missing in the kitchen when we found the cook.
He was with us when we found Yvette, so how did he kill the cook?
- I didn't.
- Expect us to believe that?
I expect you to believe it.
You killed the cook.
She informed on you to Mr Boddy.
You made one mistake.
Sitting here, Mrs Peacock said she was eating one of her favourite recipes.
And monkeys' brains, though popular in Cantonese cuisine, are not often found in Washington DC.
Colonel, when we saw the motorist at the door, you took the key to the cupboard and suggested we split up.
You left miss Scarlet, crossed the hall, opened the cupboard, took the wrench, entered the lounge, killed the motorist with a blow.
Like that!
- This is incredible!
- Not compared to what happened next.
I went upstairs with you, Mrs White.
And, while I was in the master bedroom, you hurried downstairs, turned off the electricity, got the rope, and throttled Yvette.
You were jealous of your husband and Yvette so you killed him, too.
Yes.
Yes, I did it. I killed Yvette.
I hated her so much...
It, it... flames...
Flames on the side of my face...
Breathing, breath, heaving breaths...
While we were in the billiard-room, miss Scarlet crossed to the library, and hit the cop she'd been bribing with a lead pipe.
- True or false?
- True. Who are you? Perry Mason?
- Mr green must have shot the singer.
- I didn't!
- There's nobody else left.
- I didn't do it.
The gun is missing.
Whoever's got the gun shot the girl.
- I shot her.
- You?!
I was going to expose you.
- I choose to expose myself.
- Please! Ladies present.
You thought Mr Boddy was dead. Why?
None of you had met him before.
You're Mr Boddy!
Wait!
- Who did I kill?
- My butler.
Oh, shucks.
He was expendable, like you.
I'm grateful to you for disposing of my informers.
Saved me the trouble of destroying the evidence.
This has nothing to do with my nuclear physicist husband or Colonel Mustard's work with the fusion bomb?
No, communism was just a red herring.
The police are coming.
You'll never get away with it.
Why should the police come?
Nobody's called them.
- You mean...
- Oh, my God! Of course!
Why shouldn't we escape?
Put the bodies in the cellar, leave quietly and forget any of this ever happened.
- And you'll go on blackmailing us.
- Of course, why not?
Well, I'll tell you why not.
Good shot, green.
Very good.
- You a cop?
- I'm a plant.
- A plant? Men like you are called fruits.
- Very funny.
FBI. That call from J Edgar Hoover was for me.
I told you I didn't do it.
- All right. Who done it?
- He did it.
- That gentleman...
- No!
They all did it.
But if you wanna know who killed Mr Boddy, I did.
In the hall, with the revolver.
OK, chief. Take 'em away.
I'm going home to sleep with my wife.
- Didn't mean to frighten you.
- Bit late for that... I hate that!
Then came three more murders.
None of us killed Mr Boddy or the cook.
- So who did?!
- The one person who wasn't with us.
- Yvette.
- Yvette!
She was listening to us. She heard the shot and thought he was dead.
While we examined the bullet-hole, she got the dagger, ran to the kitchen, and stabbed the cook. We heard nothing because Mrs Peacock was screaming.
Yvette returned, screamed and we ran to her.
- When did she kill Mr Boddy?
- When I said.
We ran to see the cook. Yvette checked that Mr Boddy was dead.
He followed into the hall, she hit him on the head and dragged him to the toilet.
- Why?
- To create confusion.
- It worked.
- Why did she do it?
Was she obeying orders from the person who later killed her?
- Who?
- Who?
Who?
Was it one of her clients?
Or was it a jealous wife?
Or an adulterous doctor?
- No, it was her employer, miss Scarlet.
- That's a lie.
Is it? You used her the way you always used her.
You killed the motorist.
- How did I know about the passage?
- Yvette told you.
When we split up again, you switched off the electricity.
You got the lead pipe and the rope, strangled Yvette, ran to the library, killed the cop, picked up the gun, opened the door, recognised the singer from her photo, and shot her.
- You've no proof.
- The gun is missing.
Gentlemen, turn out your pockets.
Ladies, empty your purses.
Whoever has the gun is the murderer.
Brilliant! I congratulate you.
- Me too!
- Shut up!
- One thing I don't understand.
- One thing?
Why? Half of Washington knows your business.
You were in no danger. The whole town would be implicated with you.
They don't know that my real business is secrets.
And Yvette found them out for me.
The secrets of Senator Peacock's defence committee,
Colonel Mustard's fusion bomb,
Professor Plum's UN contacts, and the work of your husband, the nuclear physicist.
So, it is political. You're a communist!
No, Mr Green.
Communism is just a red herring.
Like all prostitutes, I'm a capitalist and I'm going to sell my secrets, your secrets, to the highest bidder.
- What if we don't cooperate?
- You will, or I'll expose you.
- We could expose you. Six murders...
- It won't help your reputation at the UN.
You're implicated not only in adultery with a patient but in her death.
- And the deaths of five others.
- You don't know the UN, it might help.
- It's no good, I've no more money.
- Neither do I.
I know. But you can pay me in government information, all of you.
Except you, Wadsworth.
As a butler, you have no access to government secrets.
So, I'm afraid your moment has come.
- Not so fast! I do have a secret or two.
- Such as?
Game's up.
There are no bullets in that gun.
- I'm not falling for that trick.
- It's no trick.
One for Boddy, two for the chandelier, two at the door and one for the singer.
- That's not six.
- One plus two plus two plus one.
One for the chandelier.
One plus two plus one plus one.
That's one plus one plus two plus one.
Not one plus two plus one plus one.
One plus two plus... shut up!
The point is, there's one bullet, and guess who's gonna get it?
I'm only a guest!
Where's the chief?
Well done, Wadsworth.
I warned you. Mr Hoover is an expert on Armageddon.
Don't hate me for trying to shoot you.
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn.
There are no bullets in this gun.
One plus two... plus one...
Plus two, plus one... is...
In the dark, the murderer ran to the study, got the rope and lead pipe, ran to the billiard-room, strangled Yvette...
Ran to the library, hit the cop.
The doorbell, it was the singing telegram.
The murderer picked up the gun, ran to the door, recognised and shot the girl.
- Then ran back to the cellar.
- The cellar!
- Colonel Mustard wasn't in the cellar!
- No... but you were!
So?
You were missing when the cook and Mr Boddy died.
The cook used to be your cook.
Remember your fatal mistake?
You told us at dinner we were eating your favourite dish.
Monkey's brains, though popular in Cantonese cuisine, are not often found in Washington DC.
Is that what we ate?
- Why murder the others?
- In case Mr Boddy'd told them of you.
It was nothing to do with a nuclear physicist and the fusion bomb?
No, communism was a red herring.
Mrs Peacock did it all.
- There's no proof.
- The gun is missing.
Gentlemen, turn out your pockets.
Ladies, empty your purses.
Whoever has the gun is the murderer.
Very well.
What do you propose to do about it?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
Nothing. I don't approve of murder, but you've done the world a service by ridding it of a blackmailer and his informers.
- The police will be here any minute.
- Why? Nobody's called them.
- You mean?
- That's right!
I suggest we stack the bodies in the cellar, lock it, leave quietly one at a time and pretend none of this ever happened.
Great idea! I'll leave first, if you don't mind.
Be my guest. In fact, I think we all owe you a vote of thanks.
For she's a jolly good fellow
for she's a jolly good fellow
for she's a jolly good fellow
which nobody can deny
which nobody can deny
which nobody can deny
for she's a jolly good fellow
for she's a jolly good fellow
for she's a jolly...
- I said I didn't do it!
- What if the authorities find out?
- The FBI will take care of that.
- You mean...
Mr Hoover? I work for him, of course.
How else could I know all about you?
- One thing I don't understand.
- One thing?
Who was bribing Mrs Peacock?
A foreign power.
Her husband handles defence contracts.
- Will there be a cover-up?
- Yes, what's to be gained by exposure?
Do the FBI clean up after multiple murder?
Yes. Why do you think it's run by a man called Hoover?
Mrs Peacock?
- How did you know my name?
- The kingdom of heaven is at hand.
OK, take her away.
Take your hands off me.
I'm a senator's wife!
Wadsworth, we got her.
See? Like the mounties, we always get our man.
Mrs Peacock was a man?
Would anyone care for fruit, or dessert?
- Didn't mean to frighten anyone.
- Bit late for that!
- Then three more murders.
- So who did it?!
Let's consider each murder one by one.
Professor Plum, you knew Mr Boddy was still alive.
Even psychiatrists can tell if patients are alive or dead.
You fired the gun in the dark, missed, and pretended he was dead.
You were able to kill him later, unobserved.
He was missing in the kitchen when we found the cook.
He was with us when we found Yvette, so how did he kill the cook?
- I didn't.
- Expect us to believe that?
I expect you to believe it.
You killed the cook.
She informed on you to Mr Boddy.
You made one mistake.
Sitting here, Mrs Peacock said she was eating one of her favourite recipes.
And monkeys' brains, though popular in Cantonese cuisine, are not often found in Washington DC.
Colonel, when we saw the motorist at the door, you took the key to the cupboard and suggested we split up.
You left miss Scarlet, crossed the hall, opened the cupboard, took the wrench, entered the lounge, killed the motorist with a blow.
Like that!
- This is incredible!
- Not compared to what happened next.
I went upstairs with you, Mrs White.
And, while I was in the master bedroom, you hurried downstairs, turned off the electricity, got the rope, and throttled Yvette.
You were jealous of your husband and Yvette so you killed him, too.
Yes.
Yes, I did it. I killed Yvette.
I hated her so much...

My name is Erwin Fletcher.
I'm an investigative reporter for a Los Angeles paper.
You've probably read my stuff under the byline of Jane Doe.
It's better than Erwin.
Recently I've been loitering around the beach... trying to pass for a minor league junkie.
I don't nod out or drool; that's too obvious.
Act like you don't care and you fit right in.
Business has really picked up.
I'm still closed.
Is it a Colombian national holiday?
What do you figure, Sam?
No idea.
- No idea at all?
- Some idea.
Like when?
When it comes, it comes.
I got some reds.
You don't mean communists, do you?
Is everything a joke to you, Fletch?
Everything, Sam.
- Hey, Gummy!
- Hey, Fletch. Hey, Sam.
How's the eye?
It's OK.
The cops did it.
They always beating up on me.
- He doesn't know.
- Son of a bitch!
That's what he said.
He doesn't know?
How come he doesn't know?
I don't know.
He just doesn't know.
Son of a bitch!
I wonder how he gets the stuff.
I have no idea.
Sam never leaves the beach.
He sits in that chair.
He's out of shit.
Suddenly he gets up, he's got shit.
Where's it coming from?
The sand?
That's highly unlikely, Grease.
I oughta get some sleep.
Grease, how old are you?
Nineteen.
You're not taking very good care of yourself.
If you haven't guessed, there's been a lot of drug traffic on the beach.
I'm not talking about No-Doze.
I talkin' about the hard stuff.
A lot of it.
I've been trying to find out who's behind it.
It hasn't been easy.
I don't shower much.
Excuse me. I have something
I'd like to discuss with you.
- What's that?
- We can't talk about it here.
- Why not?
- Because we can't.
You on a scavenger hunt, or did I forget to pay my dinner check?
Come to my house to talk.
Wrong gal, fella.
I'll give you
$1,000 cash.
What?
Come to my house and listen to the proposition.
If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand... and your mouth shut.
Does this entail my dressing up as Little Bo Peep?
- It's nothing of a sexual nature.
- Yeah.
One thousand just to listen?
How can you pass that up,
Mister...
Nugent. Ted Nugent.
Alan Stanwyk.
Alan, charmed.
For an extra grand, I'll let you take me out to dinner.
What a coincidence.
What?
I almost bought this place.
Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy killed himself here. Blew it for me.
- Who?
- Hopalong Cassidy.
Bow and arrow.
Very weird.
Are you doped up?
Don't talk to me like that.
I don't work for you.
- Buenos dias.
- Buenos dias.
Pup 'N' Taco.
Oh, you've remodeled the garage.
Must have cost you hundreds.
Good idea.
I oughta frame mine.
Will the Pope be in later?
Here's my proposition.
I'm all ears.
I want you to murder me.
Here... on Thursday.
I'd like you to shoot me dead.
The reason
I ask for this service... is because I'm already facing a very long... painful and most certain death.
You see, I have bone cancer.
I don't know if you know about bone cancer.
It's the worst kind you can get.
It just eats you up bit by bit.
You don't look sick.
I don't feel sick. Not yet.
It'll get bad in a month.
After that, I'd rather not be around for it.
Why not try suicide?
I've thought about it.
My company's taken out a large life insurance policy on me.
Suicide would nullify it, but murder does not.
- Why me?
- You're a drifter.
A, uh... pardon the expression... a junkie.
Nobody would notice if you disappeared.
I've been watching you for a couple of weeks.
Maybe I'm just on vacation.
Not with the scum you hang out with.
No, I've watched... and I've thought.
It's an elegant plan.
I've even figured out your escape.
Swell.
Has it ever occurred to you
I might not want to murder you?
I've got $50,000 says you will.
And a guarantee you won't get caught.
I'm still here.
I want it done Thursday around 8:00 p.m.
My wife will be out, and it's the staff's night off.
- These will be open.
- Wouldn't they normally be locked?
Sometimes. The staff usually forgets.
I have the same trouble with my help.
I'll be here waiting for you.
The safe will be open.
There will be
$50,000 in it.
You'll be wearing rubber gloves.
Do you own rubber gloves?
I rent 'em. I have a lease with an option to buy.
Now in this drawer...
Ah!
A.357 Magnum.
My.357. You use it.
No one can trace it to you.
The room will be in disarray.
Like a burglary attempt?
You come in and catch me stealing your ties and money?
We scuffle. The gun gets loose and I shoot you.
Precisely.
- Are you a good shot?
- Yeah, I'm all right.
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
- Do you have a passport?
- Can dig one up.
Good. Now, after you kill me, take the Jaguar.
The keys will be in the glove compartment.
- Take it where?
- L.A.X.
Pan Am will have a ticket for you.
- Where am I going?
- Rio.
It departs at 11 p.m.
They serve dinner onboard?
And a movie and drinks.
Stay down there for a year.
So?
So...
You certainly thought this out.
I don't leave a great deal to chance.
Those will be open?
Take care of the gloves, the passport and the aim.
I'll handle everything else.
The gun, the money, the tickets... and the dying.
That's right.
Looks like you get the hard part.
What do you say?
You'll be doing me a great service.
Will you kill me?
Sure.
Hey! Good to see you.
Slouch, how are you?
Can I steal you?
If you promise not to return me.
- Magic today?
- Yeah, Kareem's in the wash.
I need a favor.
- Fletch!
- Did you hear something?
See what we have on Alan Stanwyk in Beverly Hills.
I need this right away.
- I take it the story's done.
- W-Y-K.
Tell me I'm right.
You're right, but you're very peaked.
Want to vomit?
Come on in.
- The story's done, right?
- Uh... almost.
Almost is not an answer.
Yes is an answer.
And a damn fine answer.
Professional journalism time now.
Go back and finish the story!
Frank, I will.
I swear it.
Something came up.
You've got a deadline tomorrow.
Did you see Sunday's ad?
I don't read the paper.
What's the spread on tonight's game?
- Lakers by six.
- Take a look.
"Shame of the City."
That's very nice.
Try to follow this.
You can't run the ad and then not run the story.
You can't? Why not?
Shit. Really?
I'm putting you on. You'll get the story. You'll be proud of it.
You broke it?
You know the source?
Practically.
Is it Fat Sam?
You said you had pictures of him.
- I do have pictures of him dealing.
- Let's go. We'll run them.
You can't do that.
Fat Sam isn't the story.
There's a source behind him.
Who?
That's a gray area.
How gray?
Charcoal.
May I help you with that?
OK. A little lighter.
Can you go higher?
Over to the right.
Higher. Perfect.
Nice and hard.
That's good. Thank you.
- That it?
- Perfect.
Everything's recent.
Let me see that. "Alan Stanwyk, commercial airline pilot... from Provo, Utah."
Formerly a test pilot, member of the Jaycees.
- Move on?
- Yeah.
Married Boyd Aviation.
He's no dummy.
That's big bucks.
His parents are Marvin and Velma,
"were unable to attend the wedding."
Those are three names I enjoy:
Marvin, Velma and Provo.
Hold it there.
Cancer.
"Cancer Society Benefit."
"Internist Dr. Joseph Dolan."
I wonder if that's his doctor.
One way to find out.
There is.
Where do you know Alan from?
We play tennis at the club.
California Racquet Club?
- Right.
- That's my club too.
I don't remember seeing you there.
I haven't been playing because of these kidney pains.
Right. How long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
No, that's Babar.
Two B's?
One "B."
B-A-B-A-R.
- That's two.
- Yeah, but not together.
I thought that's what you meant.
Arnold Babar.
Aren't there children's books... about an elephant named Babar?
- I don't know. I don't have any.
- No children?
No, elephant books.
Open wide.
Say, "Ah."
Aah.
It's an odd name.
I haven't seen it on the club registry.
I don't formally belong.
I'm a guest of my aunt's.
Your aunt?
- Right. Mrs. Smith.
- Joan or Margaret?
Uh-huh.
Which one?
Margaret.
Funny old bird.
I could tell you some stories.
I bet.
You know, it's a shame about Ed.
It was.
That was really a shame.
To go so suddenly.
He was dying for years.
But the end was very sudden.
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
But the very end, when he actually died... was extremely sudden.
Alan and I were recently speaking of dying.
He told me Boyd Aviation took out a large insurance policy on him.
You've got to be in perfect shape... to get that sort of a policy, I bet.
Drop your shorts and bend over, Mr. Babar.
No, really.
We don't need to.
We don't want to do that.
My kidneys feel better in this position.
Maybe it's that I'm not doing any calisthenics.
If I did sit-ups or bent over like this...
I'd feel 100%/% bet...
# Moon River ##
Whew! Thank you, Doc.
You ever serve time?
- Breathe easy.
- Breathe easy.
I was surprised Alan got that policy.
There's a history of cancer in the family.
- There is?
- Yeah.
As a matter of fact... Aah!
You using the whole fist?
Just relax.
I saw Alan the other day.
He was looking peaked.
Are you sure he's all right?
I can't discuss another patient.
You know that.
Well, I don't find anything wrong with you.
I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking.
12 noon.
I was anxious to return to my drug story.
But since Dr. Jellyfinger wasn't talking...
I had to find out about Stanwyk's health.
May I help you, Dr., uh...
Dr. Rosenpenis. I'm here to check Stanwyk's file.
Doctor who?
Dr. Rosenrosen.
Your name again.
It's Dr. Rosenhite.
Doctor who?
Dr. Rosen.
Where's the records room?
- Next to Pathology.
- Would you take care of these things?
I'd like to check
Alan Stanwyk's file.
Where the hell's the records room?
Next to Pathology, B1.
Collate these for me.
Where did you say that was?
- B1.
- Thank you very much.
- Take the elevator.
- Thank you.
Give me a hand, Doctor.
Me?
Come on!
Yeah.
Have you ever seen a spleen that large?
No, not since breakfast.
Here. Hold this.
I haven't sterilized my hands.
You won't make him any sicker.
I'll get it.
Ah, oh!
You never get used to the smell, do ya?
Oh, Doctor.
Are you all right?
Where am I?
- The records room.
- The records room?
- I'm fine.
- Can I get you something?
Do you have
The Beatles' White Album?
Never mind. Get me a glass of hot fat.
And bring me the head of Alfredo Garcia.
Dr. Holmes was surprised you fainted.
He was surprised?
I thought that body was my dead brother.
Oh!
That spleen was the spitting image.
No, I'm fine.
Nurse, I'm hyperventilating.
Would you get me a paper bag?
- Yes, right away.
- Thank you.
Here you are, Doctor.
Oh, thank you.
Can I help you?
No. Uh, yes, there is, actually.
One of my associates was doing a biopsy on this man.
They said he had a melanoma, carcinoma... some kind of noma.
There's no record of it here.
If he had one, it would be in here.
Wait. Here it is.
"Surgical removal of two moles.
Tissue was benign."
Benign? There's no mention of cancer? That's it?
That's it.
This is one month ago.
According to this hospital,
Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
I guess not.
He'll be so relieved.
- Thank you very much.
- My pleasure.
Have a nice day.
I'm not finished.
- Sorry, Mr. Underhill.
- Do I look finished?
I guess not.
- Now I'm finished.
- Whatever you say.
You're expecting a nice gratuity, right?
Maybe next time.
Gail Stanwyk?
Yeah.
I haven't seen you since the wedding. You look great.
I do?
That's sweet of you.
I must've been plowed at your wedding.
I don't know you.
Not my wedding, your wedding.
Oh, my wedding.
Thank God.
Doesn't really help me.
Are you a friend of Alan's?
Yes, we flew together.
I'm John.
Oh, John.
Oh, yes.
No. John who?
John Cocktoasttoy.
Beautiful name.
It's Scotch-Rumanian.
- An odd combination.
- So were my parents.
Do you mind if I practice some more?
Go ahead.
You're a member of the club, senor?
No. I'm with the Underhills.
They left, senor.
He'll be back after his urinalysis.
Would you like some drinks?
I'll put it on the Underhills' bill.
Yes. I'll have a Bloody Mary... a steak sandwich, and a steak sandwich.
So how's Alan?
He's been so busy lately,
I hardly see him.
- He's been preoccupied.
- With what?
I don't know.
Personal stuff.
Whoa!
I hit one.
Lobs are important in tennis.
Sorry, sir.
I'll show you a couple things.
Stand here.
When the ball comes, face it like this.
Yeah.
And then pivot your body, step in with your left foot.
Just like this.
OK?
Go ahead. Try one.
All right.
Go ahead.
Get in position.
The ball's going to come.
Ready?
How many are in the machine?
- A lot, I thought.
- It's finished.
Good.
Much better.
I must be having an off day.
I'm usually a fabulous player.
I affect women this way.
I bet you do.
I bumped into Alan this morning.
You know what
I can't figure out?
Alan's in Utah.
I can't figure out what I was doing in Utah this morning.
I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married.
You're hitting on me, aren't you?
How did you guess?
I'm such a heel.
Don't know what came over me.
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up...
I'd be rich.
You are rich.
See what I mean?
The vice president knew
I was opening the door... but the Secret Service...
Whack!
And blood...
Washington.
Sugar, Mr. Poon?
No, never, never.
Thank you.
Well, now, let me reiterate... that this is not a formal investigation.
If Alan Stanwyk isn't involved in improprieties...
Alan Stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties.
How can the S.E.C. make such an accusation?
You know that, and I know that... but somebody's bucking for a promotion.
It's probably that pederast Hanrahan.
If I don't go back with something... you and your son-in-law will be the scapegoats.
Unbelievable.
This is unbelievable.
They want to know why he's in Utah.
Jesus H. Christ on a Popsicle stick.
First of all...
Alan Stanwyk does not own one single share of stock.
The $3 million for the ranch in Provo... was entirely provided by my daughter... who converted her personal, non-corporate holdings.
So, if any of your D.C. boys... want to challenge that, bring them on.
Otherwise, tell them to get out of my face.
God, I admire you.
Well... consider this case closed.
It stopped bleeding.
Isn't that something?
My pleasure.
Thank you and good day.
By the way... what kind of a name is Poon?
Comanche Indian.
Good-bye.
Madeline, Frieda lost the number for Alan's realtor in Provo, Utah.
Could you get me that?
- Jim Swarthout?
- Yeah.
- Who are you again?
- I'm Frieda's boss.
- Who's Frieda?
- My secretary.
I knew my junkie pals were awaiting my good cheer on the beach... but I needed a second wind, a beer and a wardrobe change.
As I pulled up to my imitation apartment building...
I observed the Oldsmobuick of Mr. Arnold T. Pants, Esquire... attorney for the former
Mrs. Erwin Fletcher.
Time to use the service entrance.
Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.
What about trespassing and loitering?
I am neither loitering nor trespassing.
I've simply chosen an advisable location... to await my client's delinquent husband.
I prefer to discuss business inside.
Leave your rubbers outside.
A little one-on-one?
He draws the foul.
You owe Wendy $918.
She doesn't need it. She's been living with somebody for months.
I don't what you're referring to.
Wendy maintains her own residence.
This stinks.
I empathize, Fletch.
However, you threw her out.
She slept with everybody.
Prove that in court.
My lawyer was a bum.
I agree.
They slept together.
You may be right.
Are you serious?
That's history, Fletch.
You owe us $918.
Hey!
I think our problems may just be solved. Ed McMahon.
I think I just won $1 million.
"Erwin M. Fletcher, you choose."
Whoo-ee! I lost. Sorry.
It's no joke, Fletch.
If some kind of payment isn't made,
I'll have to garnish your wages.
I can't have my wages garnish-ied.
Tell you what.
Cash? I'm impressed.
I saw my pimp today.
Open your raincoat.
Come on. Just once.
It's worth it.
That's $1,000.
Apply some towards next month.
- Now scram.
- Till then.
Keep 10 and get yourself a nice piece of ass.
Our guest is the most valuable player... of the National
Basketball Association... from the Los Angeles Lakers... the all-time scoring champion of the N.B.A., Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
He's coming off a game that was second to none in his brilliant career.
You must be proud.
Definitely, Chick.
It was a great effort.
But I had a lot of help, and we're just glad to be here.
How about Fletch?
What can I say about Fletch?
He's been fantastic.
He boxes out for us, gets the tough rebounds... and does what we need to win.
It's great working with him. I don't know where we'd be without him.
Let's look at the play.
He's 6'5". With the Afro, 6'9".
Good dribbler. Comes in deep.
His club is behind by one point.
Fletch puts the ball through the legs.
What a great play!
He puts it in!
The Lakers have the lead!
Was that some play! This kid from Harlem really creates excitement.
$4 million a year, but he earns every nickel.
Look how he shakes off four or five defenders with ease.
Fletch... he truly defines grace under pressure.
See if you've got anything on Stanwyk from when he lived in Utah.
Yeah. And check out a realtor in Provo named Swarthout.
Shit!
What's going on?
Take off, Fletch!
What are you doing?
They're after
Gummy again.
Slow down.
This is dumb.
Come on, man!
He's defenseless.
Don't...
Get up!
What are you doing?
Fletch!
Let me out!
Beat it, cop!
Hey, you're really nuts.
You OK?
Yeah. I feel like $100.
- They didn't do anything.
- What are you talking about?
I busted their window.
You're lucky.
It's not luck.
They didn't want me.
They wanted Gummy.
The cops and Gummy...
Relax, Frank.
I need more time.
I could be onto something.
What?
I don't want to spoil your surprise.
Read about it tomorrow.
What do you want?
Don't point. Speak!
- I need Fletch.
- She needs me.
Nothing on Utah or Jim Swarthout.
I know. Put this on the back burner.
Right here. That's good.
You wanna give me just a little hint?
All right, Frank.
- There may be cops involved.
- Did you say cops?
- Yeah.
- That's one thing I found.
- It's from last month.
- What's this?
More cops. Frank,
I need to go to Utah.
Utah?
Yeah, Utah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada.
- What about finding the source?
- I have some ideas.
Say yes, Frank. I'll buy you some new deodorant.
Go to Transportation.
Get a ticket.
- My hero.
- Nothing to it.
You're not recording this, are you?
No. Never. Never.
Question.
Question.
Why does a man ask me to kill him... and lie about dying when he isn't dying?
Gail Stanwyk converts
$3 million of her stocks... to buy the ranch.
Why pay in cash?
Mr. Jim Swarthout?
I'm Igor Stravinsky. I'm calling about some ranch property I'd like to buy.
What did you have in mind?
Mm-hmm.
Are you a friend of Alan's?
No, not exactly.
I overheard some people talking at the club.
$3 million sounded like a good price.
Oh, is that right?
In that case,
I have been very misinformed.
Excuse you? Yes.
I'd like to come out and see you anyway. Is that all right?
What's good for you?
Well, I'm about to close up shop.
How about tomorrow morning?
First thing in the morning.
Tomorrow. Bye.
Hello!
Anybody home?
Hey, fella, what's your name?
Fluff? Fifi?
All right.
Bad dog.
Sit.
Stay.
I hate dogs.
Come on. Smile.
Say, "Fletch."
Look, defenseless babies.
Fell for the oldest trick in the book.
# Strangers in the night #
# Exchanging clothing #
# Strangers in my pants... ##
Surprise!
- What the hell's...
- Police. Spread 'em!
- Got a gun?
- Shamu's got one. Borrow his.
- What have we here?
- That's my dick.
Oh, funny boy.
What have we here?
Looks like heroin, Gene.
You just planted that.
- What'd you say?
- Wanna read me my rights?
You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to have your face kicked in.
Nice.
You have the right to have your balls stomped by him.
I'll waive my rights.
What's the booking, gentlemen?
Possession of narcotics.
The chief wants to talk to him.
You'll like Chief Karlin.
He's a nice man.
I hear he's mellowed since he came out of the closet.
Take his picture while he still has a face.
That hurts.
You've been hurting.
Give him a buzz.
Come in.
Here he is, Chief.
Easy, fellas. I'll be with you in a moment.
Did Mrs. Chief of Police help you decorate?
So... what's your name?
Fletch.
- Full name.
- Fletch. F. Fletch.
I see. What do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
I'm a shepherd.
Officers, could you excuse us for a few moments?
Go to the gym and pump each other.
Why are you doing this?
I like men.
I like to be manhandled.
I like you.
For someone caught holding a bag of heroin...
- That was planted.
- We're looking at maybe 10 years.
Is that what you want, Jane Doe?
Your editor phoned me... to respond to allegations you're about to print... concerning police involvement in narcotics dealings.
Uh-uh. I'm about to bust that beach wide open.
I don't need some penny-ante
Woodward and Bernstein... to get in the way of my men.
Your men may be involved in this.
I would think that might interest you.
Idiot!
All right.
Strictly off the record, OK?
Yeah, OK.
I got that beach crawling with undercover cops.
But if you go nosing around, you'll make the bad guys more cautious.
Makes my job harder.
And listen, if you print your story this week... it might get some of my men killed.
I can't have that,
Mr. Fletch.
You understand?
Yeah.
I understand.
I got a deadline.
The name's Karlin with a "K"?
You dipshit!
Go back to that beach, you won't live to regret it!
All right?
Hey, you and
Tommy Lasorda.
- Yeah.
- I hate Tommy Lasorda.
Hey!
I'll take care of it now.
# Swing low, sweet chariot #
I'll handle it from here.
# Comin' for to carry me home ##
Can't keep me here.
Maybe I won't keep you.
Maybe I'll blow your brains out.
I do believe that's a violation of my rights.
After I shoot you,
I stick myself with this knife... and place it in your dead hand.
Self-defense.
We don't do it anymore, but back in the old days...
You're serious.
Ask anybody.
Can I ask anybody now?
Can I call my mom, tell her I love her.
Uh... guess not.
I'm a newspaper reporter. You don't blow away newspaper reporters.
Kinda stupid, isn't it?
What will it be, Fletch?
Hey, I hate the beach anyway.
It's not even my story.
I've got a deadline on the off-track betting... in the Himalayas.
Smaller story, but I know you've been following it.
You have things under control down there.
Your beach.
Come on out.
Come on.
May I? Thank you.
How could you call him?
Fletch, I'm sorry.
You know how close to death I came?
Yeah, it's awful.
He had a gun at my head and a knife in his hand!
He threatened to kill me.
Hey, that's a shame.
He would've shot me.
Unbelievable.
You don't believe me.
Nope.
- He thinks I'm lying.
- Unbelievable.
I need an article by tomorrow.
- You believe me.
- Yes, I do.
I don't want unsubstantiated charges about dope-dealing cops... or paranoid fantasies about homicidal police chiefs.
Give me something
I can print!
Print this.
Me, too.
Hey, watch it.
You're on thin ice, Larry.
It was time to hang out at Boyd Aviation... to find out what Stanwyk was doing with that plane.
I splurged.
I invested 49 cents on some novelty teeth.
Hey!
- You the guy from Ajax?
- Yeah, you bet.
All right.
- Thought you were bringing the eight?
- They're coming.
I'm the supervisor.
I don't carry the stuff.
Freddie's bringing them?
Yeah. Freddie.
You were supposed to be here an hour ago.
Traffic was murder.
A manure spreader jackknifed on the Santa Ana.
God-awful mess.
You should see my shoes.
Whew!
Stanwyk's baby, huh?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Looks well-used.
Travels to Utah every weekend.
Is that right?
Is he a Mormon?
I don't think he's doing a lot of singing... with the Tabernacle Choir.
These executives live high.
Know what I mean?
I sure do.
That's a terrific wing.
I love this shape.
Do us a favor, pal.
Name's Liddy.
Gordon Liddy.
Take a look at the seventh Fetzer valve.
It's been sticking.
Probably the humidity.
That's funny.
I think it's the by-pass line.
It could be the by-pass line.
I should look at it.
Uh, Gordo?
Back here?
Don't tell me my business, boy!
Just checking the luggage.
Somebody should clean these windows.
There's gook all over 'em.
Look at that.
You use a lot of fuel to go to Utah?
I ask that, too.
Burns enough to go to South America and back.
South America and back.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
I always kid him.
I say:
"You doing some stunt flying up there or something?"
What's he say?
Nothing.
He just gives me that look.
You know, he's got that look.
Yeah, he just gives him that look.
Sure.
He's the boss.
Let me look at this Fetzer.
Uh, Gord.
I know. I'm getting a bird's-eye view.
Oh, ho ho.
It's the by-pass line, right?
I think so. Yeah.
Told ya.
I'll need some pliers... and a set of 30-weight ball bearings.
- What?
- Yeah.
Tell ya what.
I gotta go to my truck.
If Fred gets here before I'm back, tell him to start without me.
Why do you need ball bearings?
Come on, guys.
Maybe you need a refresher course.
Hey, it's all ball bearings nowadays.
Prepare that valve with 3-in-1 oil... and gauze pads.
And I'll need 10 quarts of antifreeze... preferably Prestone.
No, make that
Quaker State.
And wash those windows.
They got muck on 'em.
Buenos dias, senor.
Hi. Where's
Mrs. Stanwyk?
In her cabana.
I'm supposed to meet her.
Cabana six?
Cabana one. You would like something to eat or drink?
Actually, I would.
Charge it to the Underhills?
Right.
Do you have any caviar?
Si, senor. Beluga.
But it is $80 a portion.
I better just take two portions.
How's the Lobster Thermidor?
- I recommend it.
- Good. That'll be fine.
Bring two bottles of Dom Perignon.
Very good, senor.
- Put down $30 for yourself.
- Muchas gracias, senor.
Who is it?
It's John.
John who?
It's John.
John Levin... I don't remember.
John Cocktoastin?
Hi.
Hi.
I was hoping you'd say that.
I just got out of the shower.
Yeah.
Can I borrow your towel?
My car hit a water buffalo.
Nice place.
I'm surprised to see you.
What are you doing here?
I ordered some lunch.
For here?
I knew this is where my mouth would be.
I really should change.
No, you should stay the wonderful person you are today.
I mean put clothes on.
Make yourself comfortable.
Are you always this forward?
Only with wet married women.
Get the door!
Ah. Very good, gentlemen.
Come right in.
Right in this way.
Right in here.
That's good.
That's very nice.
Want I set up?
No, I'll take care of it.
Give each other $20.
- Put it on Underhill.
- Muchas gracias.
Sierra del fuego.
Oh, this is beautiful.
There we have it.
This goes on the Underhills' bill?
I saved his life during the war.
- You were in the war?
- No, he was. I got him out.
Oh.
I can't believe
I'm doing this.
This is great.
Let's eat.
- Your bill, senor.
- Oh, thank you.
- $400 for lunch?
- Your guest, senor.
We didn't have any guests today.
Two bottles of Dom Perignon?
$100 a pop!
- Jesus H. Christ! Where is he?
- With Ms. Stanwyk.
- Where's she?
- Cabana one.
Can I ask you a question?
- Depends on the question.
- More champagne?
- Yes.
- Are you still in love with Alan?
No. I mean, no, you can't ask me that question.
- Ask me another one.
- Why'd you let me in?
Um, because I'm bored.
If you're bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
Utah's not exactly a cure for boredom.
Good point.
I've never been there.
I shouldn't say that.
What about his parents?
He hasn't seen them for years.
I've never met them.
They don't get along?
- Mrs. Stanwyk.
- Yes?
I'm sorry to disturb you.
It's Ted Underhill.
Thanks for a great time.
I... Whew! ...gotta go.
Wait a minute.
What is this?
Someone of your acquaintance... has charged a $400 lunch to my account.
You don't know the Underhills?
I'd like to discuss this matter with you.
I'm just out of the shower.
- Wait a minute.
- I have to wee-wee.
Yes, of course.
- Why did you do it?
- You shouldn't have to pay the bill.
A $400 lunch tab?
It's outrageous.
It's way over the line.
I'll cover it. You can't go out looking like that.
He might spot you.
Hold on.
You look like you're the same size as Alan. Put this on.
- Nice suit.
- Just return it.
Any other surprises?
Yeah.
My name is not
John Cocktoastin.
- I wasn't at your wedding.
- Who are you?
I'm Erwin Fletcher.
I write a newspaper column under the name of Jane Doe.
So?
So... your husband hired me to kill him.
Mrs. Stanwyk.
- Mrs. Stanwyk!
- In a minute!
Enough surprises.
What are you talking about?
Sit down.
Your husband told me he was dying of cancer. Is that true?
It's not true.
That property you thought you were buying in Utah? Not true.
He's a bad guy.
He's involved in something very big and very bad.
Do you know Jim Swarthout?
Yeah. He's the man who sold us the ranch.
Wrong. He sold you
$3,000 worth of scrub brush.
I saw the deed.
You saw a forgery.
This is the real deed.
There's Swarthout's name.
If this were legible, you'd see what I meant.
This dog tried to bite me.
The motel, my car.
The Mormon Tabernacle.
Stop it. Stop.
He's told me a lot of things.
So far, not one has been true.
I'm sorry to have to tell you these things.
- Mrs. Stanwyk!
- Just wait a minute!
- I'll call my father. He'll know.
- No, you can't.
I know you don't know me, but you've gotta trust me.
Give me 24 hours.
Mrs. Stanwyk!
You a Laker fan?
No.
- Just a minute!
- I'll take you to a game.
Mrs. Stanwyk!
Sorry. Thanks. Bye.
- What are you talking about?
- I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
- If you need me, call the paper.
- What do I do for 24 hours?
- Act natural.
- I was afraid you'd say that.
Oh, Jesus. What's he doing with the chief?
Seeing Bone Cancer and Chief Karlin together... might lead to a page one item. but without real evidence,
Frank wouldn't print it.
I had to keep digging... without a shovel.
Smog Patrol.
Had your emissions checked?
- No, sir.
- Fluorocarbons? Ozone?
- No, sir.
- Well, let's check it out.
What do you say?
Smells pretty good.
That's him.
Unit 12, in pursuit.
Catch some shuteye.
Lay back and enjoy.
- Try to breathe through your nose.
- Aaah!
I use chewing gum on these rides.
It filters out the pollutants.
Aw, shit!
You've got good grillwork.
Keep out the ozone.
I gotta get this thing up to 95, check out the fluorocarbon output.
Don't worry about the speed limit.
That's why we've got the police escort.
- You a cop?
- As far as you know.
You gonna take me to jail for car theft?
- Why, did you steal the car?
- I sure did!
I'm not even sure that's a crime anymore.
Pull over!
Hey, look out for that truck!
Just a game I play with my buddies.
Hide-and-seek kind of thing.
They love it.
What a day!
Must be a stage two.
Do a little slip-streaming.
Whoa! There's Fred!
Won't he be surprised!
Don't you hear me?
I said pull over...
Uh-oh.
Got a license?
Not on me.
You have one?
- No.
- Pull over, buddy!
- Hey, Freddie, how's the herpes?
- Pull over!
- I did before. I'll pull over later.
- Pull over!
That's it.
Turn your bike in!
- You're a disgrace to the force!
- Aaah!
Get the door!
Congratulations.
You passed the test.
Raise your left hand.
My men will be right with you.
Thelma Noble, Ellis Lee Hereford...
Lee Weaver... and Harold Arthur.
I would like for you to meet our friends on the dais.
- Hold your applause until I'm finished.
- More coffee?
- Kitty Domaine, Selby Desner.
- There you go.
Barbara Wattell,
Walter Smith...
Martha Sterling and Paul Fleming.
And to my right,
Michael Kenyon...
Olivia D. Williams...
Otto Bailey...
Bea Dorfman.
And now... the Father of
Internal Bushings... our very own and beloved leader...
A man who needs no introduction!
Thank you very much, Sammy.
I couldn't wait.
That was a very nice introduction, and I am... very thrilled and proud to be here.
It's been a wonderful ceremony here on behalf of our own Fred...
"The Dorf" Dorfman!
- Who is he?
- Fred was darn near death recently.
He wasn't ashamed to admit to me that he had syphilis.
Thank God he stopped it in its tracks.
It takes a lot for a man... to admit where he got it from and how he got it.
Look at him today.
Fred, you look just wonderful.
The nose looks normal again.
The face has come back into shape.
It's not drooling anymore.
And hats off to Marge, his wife, because that whole experience... the three weeks that she stayed at Trembling Hills has paid off.
No more alcohol or sedatives in her life.
There are many other things
I wanna tell you about Fred... things that maybe many of you already know.
Sammy, you're not going to sing for us, are you?
Did you know that Fred spent much of his life... honoring a profession that has gone largely unsung around here?
Some of them are here tonight.
The profession is law enforcement.
I know Fred feels that too often our feelings are locked in... and we feel restrained and perhaps even embarrassed... to reach out and touch an officer of the law.
After all, they are people, aren't they?
Stand up. Pat them on the back.
Reach out.
Shake hands with any one of these men in blue.
Hug a cop!
Yeah, go ahead. I said it.
Yeah!
That's a wonderful feeling!
I'm so proud tonight!
# Oh, say can you see #

Mr. Stanwyk, you are confirmed on Flight 441... to Rio de Janeiro tomorrow evening,
11 p.m., first class.
That's terrific.
Thank you.
- You reconfirmed this morning.
- You bet I did.
I'm a bear for detail.
I hope there's nobody sitting next to me.
I always travel first class, and I take both seats up.
I'm in bridge work.
Bridge construction.
These fold-outs take a lot of space.
There is someone next to you.
Oh, for God don don!
Who is it? Mr. Singleton?
- No. The name is Cavanaugh.
- Cavanaugh?
Ah! Morris or Pierre?
Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
Sally Ann?
Well, terrific.
In fact, you purchased the ticket for Miss Cavanaugh.
Doesn't mean I want her sitting next to me.
The flight's full.
She's connecting out of Provo.
Oh. All right, fine.
Provo, Spain?
Utah.
Utah.
Frank, don't give me crap about the beach story.
- I'm at the airport.
- The airport?
There are two dozen cops after my ass.
I can't go home or to the office.
I'm a man without a country.
If cops are really after you, come in here. You'll be OK.
I couldn't get through the front door.
I'm going to Utah.
You go to Utah, you stay in Utah.
I'm turning the story over to a professional reporter.
The story is Utah.
Trust me.
You're going to Utah?
Fine.
If you're story is not on my desk by 11:30, you're fired.
Cujo?
Who the hell are you?
Get up!
I'm up.
- Door was unlocked.
- Lock's busted.
There you have it.
I work for the landlord.
He told me to watch out for the place.
- I commend him on his choice.
- What?
I commend him on his choice.
I was supposed to meet
Mrs. Cavanaugh here.
Who are you?
I'm Don Corleone,
Mrs. Cavanaugh's cousin.
You know where she is?
Moved out.
Moved out?
Isn't that something.
I talked to her last week.
She didn't say a thing about it.
- She moved out.
- You're saying she moved out.
- This morning.
- This morning?
God! Uh. We had so much to talk about.
Mo Green is out of the Tropicana.
My sons, Mike and Fredo, are taking over.
What did you want under the bed?
I have to pull rank on you.
I didn't want to have to do this.
I'm with the mattress police.
There are no tags on these mattresses.
I'm taking you downtown.
Give me the weapon.
I'm calling the cops.
- This is for the cops.
- Come on, man. I'm her cousin.
Tell the cops.
OK. You wanna call the cops, call the cops.
Better tie your shoelaces first.
Thanks a lot!
Stretch, what's happening?
- Got an unbelievable story here.
- Yeah? Great.
- What can I do?
- Write this down. Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
Check every hotel in L.A.
Start near the airport.
He's supposed to leave the country with her tomorrow night.
Got that, honey?
I love your body, Larry.
Good afternoon.
Howdy.
They should recall these things.
Hit one bump and the window explodes.
You're Marvin Stanwyk?
- Yeah.
- Hi there.
Harry S. Truman,
Casewell Insurance underwriters.
Harry S. Truman?
My parents were fans of the former president.
Isn't that nice.
He was a good man.
- He sure was.
- He showed the Japs a thing or two.
- Dropped the big one, huh?
- He dropped two big ones on them.
- He was a real fighter.
- Yeah.
You're in insurance, Harry?
That's right.
- Well, I'm fully covered.
- I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk.
Actually, my company sub-insures a policy... held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.
Yeah, he is.
Mr. Truman, meet my wife Velma.
- My pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.
Sit down and have a glass of lemonade.
- Thank you.
- Velma makes the most unusual lemonade.
It's hard to keep it cold on a day like this.
Where you from, Harry?
I'm from California.
San Berdoo.
Yeah. Utah is part of my route.
You folks don't mind if I ask you a couple of questions, do you?
- Shoot.
- Thank you very much.
We'll start with some routine things.
You and your wife are currently alive, I take it?
- Harry, if there's...
- It's just regulations.
Now, you, Marvin, and your wife named Velma... are the parents of one Alan Stanwyk of Beverly Hills...
Executive Vice President of Boyd Aviation.
- Check.
- Check.
And when did you last see Alan?
Oh... uh... about 10 days ago.
10 days ago?
He comes and visits about every three weeks.
Isn't that nice.
How long has he done that?
Since he moved to L.A.
Pardon me if I seem a bit personal here.
I don't know how to put it.
We understand that there's a young lady friend in Provo... that Alan's been seeing.
What's this got to do with insurance?
This is a comprehensive policy.
Forget about that lady friend business.
Alan is a loving husband.
He dotes on his bride.
Who?
His wife.
You've met her?
Of course we have.
He brings her with him.
Has Alan ever mentioned the name Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
Has he?
Boy, what in the hell's the matter with you?
- He has.
- Of course he has.
That's his wife.
Of course.
His wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
Cute as a button.
You wouldn't have a picture of them, would you?
We've got lots of pictures.
- Let me get you some.
- Great.
Still married are they,
Alan and Sally Ann?
Yes, they are.
How long have they been married?
It was before he moved to L.A.
Eight years April.
This gets heavier each year.
There we are.
Here it is.
- That's the one.
- Oh, my goodness.
She is a button, isn't she?
Isn't she cute?
Could I borrow this picture?
I promise to send it back.
- It's routine. The actuarial people...
- That's all right. We have more.
- Want to see the reception?
- No, thank you. I'm trying to quit.
How about Marvin's
65th birthday party?
- How about that, Marvin?
- They got a picture of me in here.
This is Alan?
I can't believe this!
It's really Alan, and it's really bigamy.
- How long have they been married?
- About eight years.
Who is this woman?
I think it's Alan's high school sweetheart.
Sally Ann something or other.
Alan's been keeping many secrets lately.
I'm calling the police.
No, Gail, don't.
- I'm calling my father.
- Give me one more day.
Why? Do you have any idea how humiliating this is?
Yes, I do.
I really do.
Remember what I told you?
Tomorrow night you have a club meeting.
Stay away from the house.
I'll take care of him.
- Don't worry.
- She looks like a hooker.
Look at her. Could you love someone who looked like that?
What are you talking about?
Of course not.
5, 10 minutes tops, maybe.
It's funny.
I know. Listen.
Why don't we relax and lie down and I'll fill you in.
This is a good time to make a pass at me.
- Gum?
- Who? Go somewhere else.
Gum, it's me.
- Fletch. Really, is that you?
- Shut up. Don't say my name.
Shut up. Don't look at me.
I gotta talk to you.
All right. About what?
There are cops all around here.
They're after me.
- You mean those surfers over there?
- Lay back down.
- Don't point. Just lay back.
- OK.
- Why they after you?
- I'm a newspaper reporter.
I'm nailing Chief Karlin as the major drug source on this beach.
Sit back.
Fat Sam's turning
State's evidence.
What's that?
He wrote me a nice deposition.
Said he received the drugs and you did the selling.
He said what?
Fletch, he's lying.
I didn't sell nothing.
You gotta believe me.
I just carried the drugs from the chief to Sam.
- Sure you did, Gum.
- Honest, man. That's all I did.
20 years in prison, Gum.
Unless you want to play ball.
You don't leave me much choice.
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.
These robes...
I got another question.
Where does the chief get his drugs?
I don't know.
Have fun.
Don't bend over for the soap.
Fletch.
Fletch, OK.
It's somewhere in South America.
Mind if I sit here?
Fletch?
Man...
- You don't know me, Sam.
- My pleasure, brother.
I'm a reporter, Sam.
I'm breaking the story on the drug traffic around here.
Gummy's turning
State's evidence.
I got good proof it's the chief.
You gonna bust the chief?
Gonna bust the chief.
I could use your help.
I'm a slave to that son of a bitch.
He busted me, third offense.
Said push for him or do 15 long.
All I get from this is free junk.
- You don't have a piece of the action?
- No. Free junk, that's it.
Hey, how you doing?
Albert Einstein's forehead.
You like it? Won it in a raffle.
Fellas, stay with me.
Fletch?
What's up?
- I'm quitting at midnight.
- Who are they?
This is Fat Sam and Gummy.
Come with me.
Their statements name Chief Karlin... as the number one drug pusher from here to Oxnard.
I want them to have Federal protection sponsored by the paper. OK?
- This is wonderful.
- I'm out, Frank.
- You lost faith in me.
- Fletch, I got nervous.
Forget it.
I'm writing the story.
Hold the last two paragraphs till 10:00.
You want an apology?
- You were going to can me, right?
- No, not really.
- Not really?
- I was upset. You know.
OK. Jesus,
I'm sick of this place.
Ow.
I'll try out for the Lakers.
They need a power forward.
This is a hell of a story.
Thanks.
- About these guys...
- They're fine.
You don't have valuables in there, do you?
Good evening.
I like your outfit.
Did you bring the 50 grand and the tickets?
Of course.
Oh, oh, oh. You forgot your rubber gloves.
You're planning on killing me, aren't you?
You catch on real quick,
Mr. Nugent.
That's a hostile thing to do.
You were gonna kill me.
I look at this as self-defense.
Now, if you would be so kind as to put your passport on my desk.
You're wearing my suit.
Where did you get that?
Where did you get my suit,
Mr. Nugent?
The name's Fletcher.
I'm a newspaper reporter.
I write a column under the name Jane Doe.
- What is this?
- Read this.
- I don't have time...
- Cut the crap.
Come read this.
I'm not going anywhere.
Unless my people hear differently, that letter goes out at midnight.
"Dear Mr. Boyd:
Alan Stanwyk murdered me tonight.
Charred remains found in the Jaguar are mine, not his.
Mr. Stanwyk, using my name and passport... boarded Pan Am Flight 306.
- On arrival, he intends..."
- Pretty hefty.
Keep reading.
"...with his legal wife... the former
Sally Ann Cavanaugh..."
Don't stop, Alan.
- Uh-oh. The missus.
- What are you doing here?
I know most of it. I want to hear the rest from you.
He doesn't read my stuff very well.
Let me take a crack at it.
"Sally Ann and Alan were married eight years ago... never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist, even in Utah.
Stanwyk is traveling with $3 million in cash... the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock."
It's true, isn't it?
"Sally Ann can confirm this... when the police pick her up at the Airport Marriott."
Isn't that where she is?
"By the way,
Alan is a big drug smuggler.
But you can read about that in tomorrow's paper.
Sincerely, I.M. Fletcher.
P.S. Have a nice day."
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
Bravo.
What tipped me was something your wife said while we were in bed together.
Oh?
And what was that?
She said we had roughly the same build.
From the waist up,
I imagine.
Then I figured it.
You bump me off, plop me in the car... and burn me up.
What the heck, same bone structure.
You son of a bitch.
But I'm not a stupid son of a bitch.
I was prepared to commit one murder, assface.
What makes you think
I won't commit two?
- Whoops.
- What do you mean, "Whoops"?
By the time your story's published,
I'll be on the beach.
I understand extradition from South America's complicated.
For two murders, it's even more so.
That thing loaded?
If you shoot me... you're liable to lose those humanitarian awards.
Tough shit, Hopalong.
Greetings, everyone.
Thank God, the police.
What are you doing here?
Put the gun down.
I can take care of them.
Thought you had this figured out.
Nice going, Erwin.
Don't ever call me Erwin.
Fat Sam and Gummy left the beach today.
It occurred to me that maybe there are things happening I should be aware of.
I'll take care of this.
It doesn't involve you. Go home.
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- What? Long distance?
Overheard you say something about South American extradition.
Are you taking that $800,000
I staked you with on the next load?
You two have a lot to talk over.
We'll just catch the last ten minutes of "Dynasty."
Jerry, you're gonna have to trust me!
I got a way to get rid of this asshole, and you're jeopardizing everything!
Your way is gonna land my butt on the front page... while you're basking in the sun!
With your money.
The second one's going to be more fun.
Go ahead, make my day.
Thanks.
No, this is getting absurd.
"One Bob Haldeman wig, a gorilla suit."
- A gibbon suit.
- "Tennis shorts. leather sneakers, wrist bands."
- It's business. I hate tennis.
- What's novelty teeth?
Frank, it's all business.
"A nun's habit.
Six tubes of Crazy Glue."
That's personal.
- Take it out of my raise.
- You're not getting a raise. Come on.
I would think the D.A. would need these tickets for evidence.
Not necessarily.
- Not necessarily?
- Larry!
In the court ruling
"U.S. vs. Fishbein"... a man subjected to potential incineration... while wearing another man's suit... is entitled to $10,000 worth of airline tickets.
It's an obscure ruling but very important one to me.
Why don't you say that you want to take me to Rio with you?
There's a different slant.
The thing is, we haven't really dated formally.
I take first dates to Laker games.
I don't want to go to a Laker game.
I don't like basketball.
Maybe that's because you don't understand basketball.
You haven't learned the fundamentals.
The pick and roll.
Sounds like a fast-food chain.
- Reverse stuff.
- That I've done.
I'll bet you have, you little vixen.
The coroner had certified Stanwyk dead... or extremely sleepy.
And Chief Karlin was facing
20 years in the fun house.
I decided to accompany Gail to Rio... and personally assist her in her grief therapy.
On the beach, I explained basketball to her, but she didn't grasp it.
- Fletch?
- Call me Erwin.
Why do they bounce the ball the whole time?
Doesn't it seem a little childish?
Well, it may seem that, but that's called dribbling.
- "Dribbling"?
- If they stop bouncing the ball... they get called for traveling.
Traveling. Aha.
That's what they call it when you don't bounce the ball.
When it came to basketball,
Gail was a loss.
But we had our own version of one-on-one... and she thought I was the bravest man in the world, which I am.
By the way, I charged the vacation to
Mr. Underhill's American Express card.

I'M HALLUCINATING. OVER.
DON'T TRUCK DRIVERS
TAKE PILLS FOR THAT?
I DRIVE A TRUCK.
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME
A TRUCK DRIVER.
IS THAT AFFIRMATIVE?
THERE'S A STRIKE
IN THE WEST.
THEY NEED MEAT.
SWEETHEART,
THERE SEEMS TO BE
A LOT OF
INTERFERENCE HERE,
BUT I LOVE YOU.
I ALWAYS HAVE. OVER.
WHY DO WE ALWAYS

HEY, BOSWELL.
ISN'T THAT THAT YOUNG FOX

NOW HE WILL GET HER.
USE SMITH OR JONES.
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
WHO CARES NOWADAYS?
LET'S GO.
COME ON.
OH, GOD.
FIRST HE STEALS MY GIRL,
THEN MY BED.
OK, BOSIE,
IT'S YOU AND ME, PAL.
NOW, LISTEN,

MAYBE A SCHOOL TEACHER.
NO...
AN ACCOUNTANT.
WATCH IT, KIDS,
OR YOU'LL STAY IN
THAT POSITION FOREVER.
THERE'S A MAN WITH BALLS.
BENNY BALLS.
BOSIE, THERE'S SOMETHING

IT'S SNEEZY RIDER.
HORS D'OEUVRE?

BOSIE,
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE.
MAYBE I SHOULD
PICK HER UP,
DAZZLING HER WITH
MY STYLISH RHETORIC.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
NO?
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S AGAINST REGULATIONS.
ALL RIGHT, MATE,
THAT'S NINE JAP TRAPS

YOUR ROLLS ROYCE.
WANT TO QUIT?
TAKE 2 EXTRA POINTS

OK, OK. MAKE IT 3.

[HONK HONK]
[WHIMPERING]
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
SOMETHING ABOUT
THAT VAN?
WONDER WHY
HE DOESN'T PASS.
MAYBE HE'S AFTER
OUR MEAT, HUH?
I WONDER IF THAT FOX
IS WITH HIM.
WELL, LET'S GET
A BETTER LOOK.
WHY DOES ANYBODY
GET UP AT 5 A.M.
TO WATCH
THE GARBAGE COLLECTORS?
[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS]
THE TIME IS 1:00.
THE WEATHER IS
CLEAR AND STABLE.
HERE'S THE NEWS--
A COUNCIL WORKER
IN THE BRISBANE SUBURB
OF EAGLE FARM
DISCOVERED A HUMAN HAND
IN A STORM WATER DRAIN.
THE HAND WILL BE COMPARED
WITH THE HUMAN LEG
DISCOVERED IN TOWNSVILLE
LAST WEEK.
POLICE ARE DENYING
SPECULATION
OF A JACK-THE-RIPPER-TYPE
MURDERER AT LARGE,
CLAIMING THE TWO
GRISLY ITEMS
ARE PROBABLY UNCONNECTED
AND ISOLATED.
WELL, WELL.
...WHO IS THE PRINCIPAL
ANTAGONIST IN THE STRIKE,
WHICH HAS LEFT PERTH
WITHOUT MEAT.
THE FEDERATION
HAS ASKED ANYONE
KNOWING THE WHEREABOUTS
OF MR. DAY,
WHO'S BELIEVED
TO BE RETURNING WITH HIS FAMILY
FROM THE NEVADA CARAVAN PARK--
SUCKER.
HELLO THERE.
WAIT A MINUTE, MISS.
I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO PICK UP HITCHHIKERS.
I'M NOT HITCHHIKING.
MY IDIOT HUSBAND
DROVE OFF,
LEAVING ME HERE.
WE CAN CATCH HIM
IF YOU HURRY.
ISN'T THIS COZY?
SO HIGH UP.
BET I GET TRUCK-SICK.
I'M MADELYN DAY.
IT'S A PLEASURE.
FLOYD,
MY IDIOT HUSBAND,
CALLS ME SUNNY,
SUNNY DAY.
SOUNDS LIKE A WILD
AND CRAZY GUY.
WE'VE GOT A DAUGHTER,
DORIS DAY,
LIKE THE MOVIE STAR.
WE CAN GO NOW,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.
I CAN TAKE YOU
AS FAR AS YELLOWDINE.
YOU CAN PHONE THE POLICE
FROM THE ROADHOUSE.
DOES YOUR DOG BITE?
HE'S NOT A DOG.
IT LOOKS LIKE A DOG.
HE'S A DINGO.
DINGO?
WHY KEEP A DINGO?
I LIKE HIM.
HE'S QUIET.
A DINGO'S
LIKE A DOG,
SO WHAT'S
THE DIFFERENCE?
A DOG IS
A PARASITE HYBRID--
HE BARKS AT SHADOWS
AND EATS HIS FECES,
BUT A DINGO'S CLEAN,
INTELLIGENT, QUIET.
HE'S PHYSICALLY
INCAPABLE OF BARKING.
THEY CALL HIM
"THE SILENT DOG."
HE'S AN ARISTOCRAT...
LIKE ME.
ARE ALL TRUCK DRIVERS
SO STUCK-UP?
DRIVING A TRUCK
DOESN'T MAKE ME
A TRUCK DRIVER.
YOU AND YOUR WOLF,
ABOVE IT ALL...
ARE YOU MARRIED?
NO.
AREN'T YOU
PICKING HER UP?
THAT HITCH WILL
MAKE PERTH BEFORE US.
SUCH LANGUAGE.
NO,HITCH.
A GENTLEMAN
WOULD HAVE STOPPED,
WITH THIS MANIAC
RUNNING AROUND...
WHAT MANIAC?
ON THE RADIO.
YEAH, GO ON.
JUST SOME MANIAC.
DID THEY DESCRIBE
HIS RIG?
I DIDN'T MENTION
A RIG.
HOW DID YOU KNOW
MY HUSBAND WAS
AN ACCOUNTANT?
JUST A GUESS.
HOW FAR AWAY
IS THIS ROADHOUSE?
NOT FAR.
GOOD.
WE HAVE
AN ACCIDENT HERE.
WE'RE CLEARING THE ROAD.
PLEASE PULL OVER.
WHERE ARE WE GOING?
SHORT CUT.
WAIT. I'VE GOT IT.
THE HOOCHIE-KOOCHIE
DOLL.
IT'S MINERAL,
NOT ANIMAL.
I'VE GUESSED EVERYTHING
IN THE TRUCK.
MAYBE IT ISN'T
IN THE TRUCK.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
IT COULD BE ANYTHING.
YOU WANTED
TO PLAY GAMES.
GIVE UP?
YEAH.
IT'S YOUR BOOTS.
MY BOOTS?
LEATHER IS
AN ANIMAL PRODUCT.
MY BOOTS ARE
IMITATION LEATHER.
THEY'RE VINYL,
THERMOSPLASTIC RADICAL,
WHICH MAKES THEM EITHER
MINERAL OR VEGETABLE,
BUT CERTAINLY
NOT ANIMAL.
SO I WIN.
BUT YOU GAVE UP!
OK, OK, OK.
IT'S MY TURN.
UM...ANIMAL.
THAT FLY THERE.
IF YOU WON'T PLAY
PROPERLY, FORGET IT.
IS IT THE FLY?
YES, IT'S THE FLY,
BUT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
NARROW IT MORE LOGICALLY.
OK, HERE'S
ANOTHER ONE.
I'VE HAD ENOUGH.
IT'S REALLY EASY,
JUST A PLAIN
ORDINARY ANIMAL.
OK, BUT NO TRICKS.
IT'S BIGGER
THAN A BREAD BOX.
ME?
NO.
- BOSWELL?
- NO.
- IT MUST BE YOU.
- WRONG.
IF THERE'S AN ANIMAL
INSIDE THIS TRUCK, YOU'D BETTER
TELL ME ABOUT IT.
I NEVER SAID IT WAS
INSIDE THE TRUCK.
PIGS?
NO.
KANGAROO?
NO.
EMU?
NO.
THE NULLARBOR NYMPH?
LAWRENCE OF
FRIGGING ARABIA?
THIS IS CRAZY.
YOU GIVE UP?
YEAH.
THAT MAN BACK THERE.
I DIDN'T SEE ANY MAN.
YOU WERE ARGUING.
HE WAS BY
A GREEN VAN,
DIGGING A HOLE.
WHAT THE HELL
IS HE DOING?
I TOLD YOU,
DIGGING A HOLE.
WHAT'S WRONG?
WHAT'S WRONG?
SHH!
WHAT THE HELL
WAS HE BURYING?
IS THIS
ANOTHER GAME?
WHY DOES A MAN STOP
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE
AND DIG A HOLE?
MAYBE HE NEEDED,
YOU KNOW, A TOILET.
LADY, YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND.
THIS SAME GUY PICKED UP
A HITCHHIKER LAST NIGHT.
THIS MORNING, HE WATCHED
GARBAGE BAGS BEING COLLECTED
OUTSIDE THE MOTEL.
NOW HE'S BURYING
MORE GARBAGE.
DOESN'T THAT
SEEM WEIRD?
YOU TRUCKERS
TAKE DRUGS, DON'T YOU?
YOU'VE GOT THE DDTs.
"CAST TO THE WIND
THY GHASTLY SIN."
PARDON?
THAT'S IT.
THE GHASTLY SIN
IS DISSIPATED,
ERASED FROM EXISTENCE.
AND ANOTHER THING--
A BODY WOULDN'T LAST
HALF A DAY OUT HERE.
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
I'M TALKING ABOUT SEX!
SEX STOLEN FROM
A YOUNG GIRL
IN THE BACK OF A VAN
OR A SEEDY MOTEL.
I'M TALKING ABOUT GUILT--
TERRIBLE GUILT,
AWFUL GUILT.
A GUILT SO TERRIBLE
IT CAN ONLY
BE OBLITERATED
BY SPREADING THE EVIDENCE
ALL OVER THE COUNTRYSIDE.
JESUS!
I WANT
OUT OF HERE.
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT EXACTLY DID
THEY SAY ON THE NEWS?
I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING.
YOU'RE THE AUTHORITY
ON WEIRDOS.
HELP ME OUT.
IT WAS SOMETHING ABOUT
JACK THE RIPPER, OR--
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
I'VE GOT A GAME.
I'M NOT INTERESTED.
IT'S ANIMAL.
NO!
IT'S BIGGER
THAN A BREAD BOX,
BUT IT'S SMALL ENOUGH
TO FIT IN A PLASTIC
RUBBISH BAG.
THAT'S A SICK GAME!
IT WOULDN'T FIT ANYWAY.
IT WOULD IF YOU
CUT OFF THE--
STOP IT!
HEY, LADY!
LADY!
LADY, STOP!
I'M NOT GOING
TO HURT YOU, I PROMISE.
YOU STOPPED ME
ON THE ROAD, REMEMBER?
I'M JUST
A TRUCK DRIVER.
I'M GIVEN TO FLIGHTS
OF IMAGINATION,
BUT THERE'S NO NEED
TO BE AFRAID OF ME.
LET'S GO BACK
TO THE TRUCK, OK?
WE DON'T
WANT TROUBLE.
WE NEVER
WANTED TROUBLE.
THEY THREATENED
MY CHILDREN.
THEY KILLED OUR DOG.
THE POLICE SAID
THE STRIKE
WAS FLOYD'S FAULT.
WE'VE GOT OUR OWN
PROBLEMS, MISTER.
I DIDN'T SEE
ANY MAN BACK THERE,
UNDERSTAND?
YEAH, I THINK I DO.
NO VANS,
NO LUNCH BOXES,
OR ANYTHING TO DO
WITH POLICE.
AND NO MORE GAMES.
ALL RIGHT.
NO MORE GAMES.
HELLO?
I'M TRYING TO REACH
THE NEAREST POLICE STATION.
HOLD ON A SECOND.
[PUTTING COINS IN BOX]
MY NAME IS QUID,
AND I'M CALLING
FROM YELLOWDINE.
SORRY. YELLOWDINE.
RIGHT.
I MAY HAVE INFORMATION
REGARDING THOSE MURDERS
YOU'RE INVESTIGATING.
YEAH.
NO, NO. MY NAME IS QUID.
QUID?
PATRICK QUID.
Q-U-I-D.
QUID.
AS IN POUND NOTE.
I'M A TRUCK DRIVER.
A TRUCKIE. RIGHT.
LISTEN, I MAY HAVE SOME--
HELLO?
HELLO?
UH, SORRY, SORRY.
I WAS SAYING, UH--
WELL, I...I--
I THINK WE'VE GOT
A BAD CONNECTION HERE.
I'D RATHER NOT GET INTO IT
OVER THE PHONE.
WHAT DOES IT MATTER
WHAT MY NAME IS?
I CAN'T STICK AROUND.
I'VE GOT A LOAD OF MEAT
THAT, UH--
IT HAS TO DO
WITH THIS BUSINESS
ON THE NEWS ABOUT, UH--
WHAT?
MEAT.
PIGS.
NO. I'M CARRYING
MEAT, MATE.
M-E-A-T, AS IN MEAT.
IT HAS TO DO WITH A GUY
IN A DARK GREEN VAN.
WHAT?
IF YOU'LL JUST HOLD ON
AND LISTEN FOR A SECOND.
HAS ANYONE SEEN A GUY
IN A DARK GREEN VAN?
THANKS.
I'M SORRY, UM--
I WAS TALKING ABOUT
A GUY IN A GREEN--
[JUKEBOX PLAYS]
HOLD ON A SECOND.
WOULD YOU KILL
THAT MUSIC, PLEASE?
HELLO.
WHAT?
NO, IT'S QUID.
"Q" AS IN
QUARTERMASTER,
"U" AS IN UTOPIA,
"I" AS IN ICE CREAM.
I-C-E-C-R-E--
OH, JESUS.
I CANNOT
STICK AROUND.
I'VE GOT TO GET
MY PORKERS TO PERTH.
IT'S Q-U-I-D!
"D" AS IN DEATH
TO YOUNG GIRLS!
EXCUSE ME.
THAT YOUR DINGO?
YEAH.
THERE'S A BOUNTY
ON THEM IN THIS DISTRICT.
HE'S JUST A PET.
WE'RE TRAVELING
ON THROUGH.
NEITHER HERE NOR THERE
TO THE LOCALS.
THEY SHOOT THEM
ON SIGHT.
YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO
BREAK THE LAW, WOULD YOU?
BOSWELL!
BOS!
[WHIMPERING]
BOSWELL,
WHAT HAPPENED?
SON OF A BITCH!
[HONK]
WHAT THE HELL--
[HONK HONK]
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO HIM?
IF THAT'S HOW
YOU WANT IT.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
WHAT DO YOU SAY, BOSWELL,
THIRD TIME, LUCKY?
AREN'T YOU KIND OF YOUNG
TO BE HITCHHIKING?
AREN'T YOU KIND OF OLD
TO BE PICKING ME UP?
IT'S NOT A PICKUP,
JUST A LIFT.
I DON'T USUALLY
PICK UP HITCHHIKERS.
WHAT MAKES ME
THE EXCEPTION?
I GUESS I JUST
FELT SORRY FOR YOU.
I DIDN'T KNOW
THERE WERE ANY
CHIVALROUS
TRUCK DRIVERS.
OH, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR DINGO?
YOU DIDN'T SEE A GUY
IN A GREEN VAN?
YEAH. WHY?
WONDER WHY HE
DIDN'T PICK ME UP.
YOU SOUND DISAPPOINTED.
HOW OLD ARE YOU
ANYWAY, HITCH?
OLD ENOUGH.
HOW OLD ARE YOU?
OLD ENOUGH
TO BE YOUR FATHER.
MY FATHER'S 67.
MAYBE HE MAKES LOVE
TO THEM FIRST.
HITCH, DOES YOUR FATHER
KNOW YOU HITCHHIKE?
MY NAME ISN'T HITCH.
DOES YOUR MOTHER
KNOW YOU'RE GONE?
SHE'S DEAD.
MY FATHER LIVES
WITH A WHORE.
YOU RAN AWAY?
I WALKED AWAY.
YOU SHOULD
LET HIM KNOW
YOU'RE OK.
THAT'S HOW HE
GETS HIS ROCKS OFF.
YOUR FATHER?
NO. YOUR MR. SMITH.
MAYBE HE MAKES LOVE
TO THEM AFTERWARDS.
WHY DO YOU THINK
HE DOES IT?
DON'T GET
CARRIED AWAY.
IT'S THE MOST FUN
I'VE HAD ALL AFTERNOON.
OK. I'VE GOT A GAME.
GOOD. SCRABBLE.
CALL IT THE SMITH
OR JONES GAME.
SOUNDS INTERESTING.
LET'S ASSUME THERE'S
A METHOD TO HIS MADNESS,
THAT EVERYTHING HE DOES
IS LOGICAL, RIGHT?
HE'S KILLED A GIRL.
DID HE MAKE
LOVE TO HER?
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
WE SHOULD KNOW WHAT
HE THINKS OF WOMEN.
IT'S MY GAME.
IT'S THE METHOD
WE'RE INTERESTED IN.
HE KILLED THIS GIRL.
HOW DOES HE DESTROY
THE EVIDENCE?
CUTS IT UP.
YEAH, BUT WHY?
UM...
SO THE PIECES
WON'T BE FOUND.
BUT PIECES DON'T
PROVE ANYTHING.
AN ARM OR LEG
PROVES NOTHING.
YOU CAN LOSE
AN ARM OR LEG
WITHOUT BEING DEAD,
BUT IF YOU
LOSE YOUR TORSO,
YOU'RE
DEFINITELY DEAD.
YOU'VE
DEFINITELY HAD IT.
BUT ONE TORSO
IS LIKE ANOTHER.
FOUL.
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT
WHAT HE DOES.
WHAT DOES HE
THINK OF WOMEN?
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO
GET INSIDE HIS HEAD?
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT HE THINKS.
HE THINKS
WOMEN ARE PIGS.
BUT WHY?
I THINK YOU
HAVE MORE FUN
SITTING HERE
WITH YOUR STEREO
AND YOUR
AIR CONDITIONING
AND YOUR DINGO.
YOU DON'T
WANT TO KNOW.
YOU ALWAYS
DONE THIS?
AT YOUR AGE,
I WAS FIRST MATE
ON A GUNBOAT
IN THE PERSIAN GULF.
JOHN BLOODY WAYNE.
BY THE TIME I WAS 30,
I WAS TRANSPORTING GUNS
ACROSS THE SUDAN BORDER.
NOW YOU'RE PUSHING
PIGGIES TO PERTH.
HITCH, YOUR FATHER
MIGHT HAVE THE COPS
OUT LOOKING FOR YOU.
HE WOULDN'T DO THAT.
OH, YEAH?
[SIREN]
WOULD YOU
STEP DOWN, PLEASE?
WHAT YOU CARRYING?
PIGS.
YOU ALWAYS PICK UP
HITCHHIKERS?
NO.
YOU PICK ONE UP
LAST NIGHT?
THE MELBOURNE
CAR HOTEL MANAGER
CLAIMS YOU CHECKED IN
WITH SOMEONE
FITTING THE DESCRIPTION
OF A MISSING PERSON.
ME?
YOUR NAME WAS
ON THE REGISTER.
ANYBODY COULD'VE
COPIED MY NAME
OFF THE TRUCK.
WHY WOULD ANYONE
WANT TO DO THAT?
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THAT GIRL?
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
SOMETHING
HAPPENED TO HER?
I DON'T WANT
TO GET HUNG
FOR SOMETHING
I DIDN'T DO.
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
DID YOU TELL THEM
ABOUT THE LUNCH BOX?
OH, SURE.
WHERE WERE YOU
A WEEK AGO
LAST SATURDAY?
PORT HEDLAND.
AND THE SATURDAY
BEFORE THAT?
UM...
I WAS LAID UP OVERNIGHT
IN MELBOURNE.
THE LOGBOOK
CONFIRMS THAT.
LOGBOOKS
CAN BE CHEATED.
BOOK OF LIES
THEY'RE CALLED, RIGHT?
IS THIS ABOUT THE THING
ON THE RADIO?
CATCH UP WITH THE GUY
IN THE GREEN VAN.
ACCORDING TO THIS,
YOU SHOULD HAVE HAD
A 12-HOUR STOPOVER.
YOU DON'T RESPECT
THE LAW, DO YOU?
WELL...
IF THAT YOUNG LADY
COMES TO ANY HARM,
WE'LL KNOW
WHO TO TALK TO.
IT WASN'T ME.
TALK TO
THE MOTEL MANAGER.
HOW LONG YOU HAD
THAT DINGO?
FOUR OR FIVE YEARS.
WHY?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
DIDN'T THEY
BELIEVE YOU?
I'M LUCKY THEY DIDN'T
SHOOT BOSWELL.
DO THEY KNOW
ABOUT OUR FRIEND
IN THE VAN?
I BEG YOUR PARDON?
I GET IT.
YOU KNOW WHAT
THIS MEANS?
WE'LL HAVE TO
GET HIM OURSELVES.
ELEMENTARY,
MY DEAR WATSON,
EXCEPT OUR FRIEND
COULD BE ALL THE WAY
TO PERTH
OR TIMBUKTU.
YOU TELL EVERYBODY
THIS STORY,
NOW YOU WON'T DO
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
NOPE, NOT TODAY.
WHY NOT TODAY?
I'M NOT TRYING
TO LAY A TRIP ON YOU,
BUT WE'VE GOT TO STOP
FOR THE NIGHT.
WHY?
REGULATIONS.
"NOTHING BESIDE REMAINS
"AROUND THE DECAY
OF THAT COLOSSAL WRECK,
"BOUNDLESS AND BARE,
ALONE AND LEVEL SANDS
STRETCH FAR AWAY."
HOW DO YOU LIKE
MY PLACE?
IT NEEDS WORK.
I ONLY KEEP IT
TO IMPRESS THE LADIES.
I'LL BET
THEY'RE IMPRESSED.
FIRST STOP
ON THE PAT QUID
GUIDED TOUR.
HITCH, YOU CAN LEAVE.
CALL ME A CAB?
I'M PAMELA,
NOT HITCH.
PAMELA WHAT?
THAT'S ALL
YOU NEED TO KNOW.
WHAT'S THE MYSTERY?
ARE YOU ON THE LAM?
IF I WAS, WOULD YOU
TURN ME IN?
ME? NO.
WELL, I'M NOT.
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT
TO HIDE?
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE
SOMEBODY'S DAUGHTER.
MOST GIRLS ARE
SOMEBODY'S DAUGHTER.
YOU'RE NOT
JUST SOMEBODY'S.
QUICK.
YOU'RE NOT WHAT I'D CALL
THE TYPICAL HITCHHIKER.
THAT LOOK IS NOT
EARLY SALVATION ARMY.
SO COME ON.
WHO'S YOUR DAD?
COME ON.
I PROMISE I WON'T
HOLD IT AGAINST YOU.
HE'S IN THE DIPLOMATIC
SERVICE, LET'S CALL IT.
AND YOU DIDN'T LIKE
THE SERVICE?
LIFE WAS INCREDIBLY
DIPLOMATIC IN CANBERRA.
NOW YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR A LITTLE ADVENTURE?
I COULD GO
TO DISNEYLAND
FOR ADVENTURE.
I'M LOOKING
FOR EXCITEMENT.
AHA.
WHAT IS
THIS PLACE, ANYWAY?
IT'S AN OLD
TELEGRAPH STATION.
THERE USED TO BE A TOWN
OF 700 PEOPLE HERE.
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THEM?
THEY WERE DEVOURED...
BY THE DREADED
ORYCTOLAGUS CUNICULUS.
SOUNDS EROTIC.
LISTEN.
LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY.
YOU CAN HEAR HIM
OUT THERE...MUNCHING.
IS HE ANIMAL,
MINERAL, OR VEGETABLE?
OR IS IT MAN,
ADVANCING LIKE AN ARMY
OF PLASTIC DENTURES,
DEVOURING HIS FELLOW MAN?
AND WOMAN.
AND WOMAN.
THANK YOU.
WHAT IS A...
CUNIC--
CUNICLUN.
CUNICULUS.
WHAT IS IT?
A RABBIT...
A BUNNY RABBIT.
NO, I'M SERIOUS.
IN THE 1800s,
THERE WAS A PLAGUE
OF RABBITS.
THEY ATE ALL
THE VEGETATION.
THE SAND DUNES ADVANCED,
SO EVERYBODY LEFT.
I GUESS THAT'S WHY
I LIKE IT HERE.
RABBITS?
YOU'RE WEIRD.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
USE YOUR IMAGINATION.
HITCH...
PAMELA...
WATCH OUT
FOR THE BUNNIES, HUH?
[THUNDER]
HELLO?
HELLO!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
KEEPING THE
PASSENGERS COMFY.
SHUT THE DOOR.
YOU'LL LET
THE COLD OUT.
"GOOD-BYE,
YOUNG PORKERS.
GOOD-BYE,
AND KEEP COLD."
AAH!
"DREAD 50 ABOVE
MORE THAN 50 BELOW."
HOW YOU DOING?
OK.
ROBERT FROST.
HOW DID YOU SLEEP?
I CAN SLEEP
ON A FENCE POST.
HOW ABOUT YOU?
OH...
"SLEEP NOT,
DREAM NOT.
THIS BRIGHT DAY
WILL NOT, CANNOT
LAST FOR AYE."
EMILY BRONTE.
RIGHT.
READ MUCH OF HER?
YEAH.
IN SCHOOL?
NO. SELF-EDUCATED,
MORE OR LESS.
WHAT'S THAT EXPRESSION?
"EDUCATION IS
HANGING AROUND
LONG ENOUGH--"
WHY DO YOU
ALWAYS DO THAT?
DO WHAT?
TALK IN POEMS.
DO I?
POEMS ARE OLD
AND DUSTY.
YOU'RE NOT
OLD AND DUSTY.
HOW OLD ARE YOU?
TOO OLD.
I DON'T THINK SO.
WHAT'S THAT?
"PIG IN A POKE,
YOU BETTER
START SHAKIN'.
TODAY'S PIG IS
TOMORROW'S BACON."
T.S. ELIOT?
HI, DADDY. IT'S ME.
NO. I'M FINE.
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHERE I AM. I'M FINE.
HELLO, NANCY.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"GET RAPED"?
HE'S ACTUALLY
A VERY NICE GUY.
YES, HE IS
A TRUCK DRI--
LOOK, I DIDN'T CALL
TO GET YELLED AT.
I WANTED TO LET
YOU KNOW I'M FINE.
[ALARM SOUNDS]
NO, I'M NOT
COMING BACK.
NOT NOW.
I'LL CALL YOU LATER,
ALL RIGHT?
WHAT DID HE SAY?
HE WAS DIPLOMATIC.
MY STEPHOOKER
WANTED TO KNOW
IF I'VE BEEN
LAYING TRUCKERS.
SEE WHAT
I'M UP AGAINST?
WELL, THEY KNOW
YOU'RE ALIVE.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
GOT TO USE
THE LADIES ROOM.
QUID?
HERE.
EXCUSE ME, UH...
WAIT HERE.
KIND OF CAUGHT YOU
WITH YOUR PANTS DOWN,
DIDN'T WE?
BUTCHERING YOUNG GIRLS
IS ONE THING,
BUT WHEN YOU
HURT MY ANIMAL,
YOU MADE A MISTAKE.
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
CAT GOT YOUR TONGUE,
YOU MISERABLE STINK?
WORD TO THE WISE, SHITHEAD.
YOU TRY ANYTHING FUNNY,
THIS DOG WILL EAT YOU.
YOU KNOW,
THERE'S NO WAY OUT,
EXCEPT DOWN THE S-BEND
OR THROUGH ME, COWBOY.
I'M TALKING TO YOU,
SMITH, JONES,
OR WHATEVER
YOUR NAME IS!
AH-CHOO!
OH, I'M SORRY, MATE.
I THOUGHT IT WAS
SOMEBODY ELSE.
I APOLOGIZE, REALLY.
HITCH.
GO TO THE TRUCK,
BOSWELL!
AH! AH! AH!
WHAT THE--
SHIT.
BOSWELL.
LOOK OUT, MATE.
LOOK OUT.
WATCH THAT DINGO.
HE'S VICIOUS!
GO STRAIGHT
FOR YOUR CROTCH,
IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL.
AH! AH! AH!
IF YOU READ ABOUT THIS
IN THE PAPERS,
YOU'LL KNOW WHAT
IT'S ABOUT.
YOU GOING TO GO
FOR HIS CROTCH?
THAT'S FUNNY.
HE'S SLOWING DOWN.
MAYBE HE'S OUT OF GAS.
MAYBE THIS IS
SOME NEW KIND OF GAME.
SHE DOESN'T LOOK
TOO KIDNAPPED TO ME.
WHAT IS SHE DOING,
PSYCHOANALYZING HIM?
YOU DON'T THINK
SHE'S STUPID ENOUGH
TO BLACKMAIL HIM?
WELL, I...
I DON'T KNOW, BOSIE.
MAYBE WE'VE BEEN BARKING
UP THE WRONG TREE.
[HORN HONKS]
I TOLD YOU
WHEN WE PICKED HER UP,
"SHE IS TROUBLE."
WE SHOULDN'T
HAVE DONE IT.
I HOPE SHE STEALS--
AT LEAST SHE DIDN'T
GET MY WALLET.
WELL, SHE'S ALL YOURS,
MR. SMITH
OR FREAKING JONES.
WHATEVER YOUR GAME IS.
WHAT HAVE WE GOT
ON HIM ANYWAY?
WHAT DO WE
KNOW ABOUT HIM?
WE KNOW ABSOLUTELY ZILCH.
IS IT AGAINST THE LAW
TO DIG A HOLE
IN THE DESERT?
IS IT A CRIME
TO HAVE A LUNCH BOX
AND THUMP DINGOS?
WHAT DOES THAT PROVE?
WHAT IF HE IS
BUTCHERING FEMALES,
MAKING THEM INTO TACOS?
IF THE COPS
DON'T CARE, I DON'T.
WHY IS IT
MY RESPONSIBILITY?
WE'RE TRUCKERS,
AND FROM NOW ON,
WE'RE GOING TO TRUCK!

THIS IS THE NEWS
IN BRIEF.
THE UNITED MEATWORKS FEDERATION

AUTHORITIES DENY
ANY POSITIVE CONNECTION
BETWEEN THE MISSING GIRLS

EXTREMELY DANGEROUS

MANIAC. HE CUTS THEM UP

NOTHING ON ME.
I'M NOT WORRIED.
I CAN PROVE IT.
WELL, AUTOPSY...

I WAS ON THE ROAD

HITCH.
WHAT WAS HER NAME?
I THINK IT WAS PAMELA.

SHE WAS WORTH SOMETHING.
FALLS ON HER BACK,
LEGS UP,
READY TO GIVE A GOOD WHACK
TO THE FIRST TOM, DICK OR HARRY
THAT COMES ALONG.
THEY'RE ALL THE SAME.
THEY DO IT LIKE ANIMALS.
NO OFFENSE, PAL.
FORGET IT, BUDDY.
SHE ISN'T WORTH
A SECOND GLANCE.
I MAY START TAKING DOPE.
I GOT TO STOP
THESE HALLUCINATIONS.
OHH.
MAYBE HE DOES
MAKE LOVE TO THEM FIRST.
ONE THING FOR SURE...
I NEED SOME SLEEP.

HOW MANY ROWS HERE?
20 ON THIS SIDE--
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
TWO.
WE JUST MISCOUNTED.
350 DIVIDED BY 8--
I FORGOT TO LATCH THE DOORS
THIS MORNING
WHEN I WAS
TALKING TO HITCH.
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?
SAM THREW THEM IN
BY MISTAKE.
SAM DOESN'T
MAKE MISTAKES.
MAYBE IT WAS PAYOLA.
HE TAKES CARE
OF HIS FRIENDS IN PERTH.
35 TIMES 2.
THE FRONT MEAT
WASN'T FROZEN
BECAUSE WE
WERE GOING FAST.
THE COLD AIR...
HOT AIR.
WOULD BE HEAVIER--
WELL, MORE DENSE.
JUST...IT WASN'T
CIRCULATING, THAT'S ALL.
HOT AIR.
YEAH.
THAT'S ALL.
STEEP DESCENT.
IT'S ALL DOWNHILL
FROM HERE, HARRY.
COME ON, BABY,
WE'RE GAINING ON HIM.
HE'S SLOWING DOWN AGAIN.
HE'S RUN OUT OF GAS.
I KNEW IT!
OH, SHIT!
HEY, LESTER.
HEY THERE, QUID.
YOU GOT
SOME HEAT TONIGHT.
BLOODY COPS.
WHO ARE THEY
LOOKING FOR ANYWAY?
FOR SOME POOR BASTARD.
LET'S GET YOU WEIGHED.

BLOODY ANIMAL.
I WOULDN'T
HAVE ONE MYSELF.
NEW TRB THING.
THEY SNIFF OUT MARIJUANA.
YOU GOT ME.
I CONFESS.
HE WOULDN'T KNOW POT
FROM POT ROAST.
I'VE GOT
TO GET GOING.
I'VE MADE A FRESH
POT OF COFFEE.
THANKS, BUT I'LL
TAKE A RAIN CHECK.
OH, RIGHT, RIGHT.
ON YOUR WAY.
HOLD IT, QUID!
SOMETHING'S
WRAPPED AROUND
YOUR AXLE.
WHAT IS IT?
IT'S A BUNCH
OF WIRE.
IT'S PROBABLY WHY
YOU'RE 75 KILOS OVER.
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
I'VE GOT SOME
WIRE CUTTERS.
NO, THANKS, LES.
YOU'LL BUGGER UP
YOUR TRAILER.
THANKS FOR THE HAND.
I ONCE PULLED
A ROAD TRAIN
AND GOT A LENGTH

IT GOT CAUGHT
ON A CATTLE GRID.
SNEAKY BASTARD.

AAH!
[SIRENS]
WAIT A MINUTE!
WAIT A MINUTE!
I'M THE WRONG GUY.
STAND BACK, PLEASE.
TAKE YOUR FAMILIES
AND CLEAR.
STAND BACK.
HE TRIED PUSHING ME
OFF A CLIFF.
HE TRAPPED ME
IN A TOILET.
HE DROVE UP
WITH A PICKUP.
HE WAS SHOUTING
OBSCENITIES AT ME.
WAIT. IT'S THAT GUY.
DON'T LET HIM GET AWAY!
THAT GUY OVER THERE!
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,
CHECK THE VAN.
JUST CHECK THE VAN!
IS THAT YOUR DOG?
HE'S NOT A DOG.
HE'S--
HE BARKS.
THAT'S HIM!
HITCH!
YOU SAID HE WAS
IN THE BATHROOM.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
I THOUGHT YOU
WERE DEAD.
I'VE BEEN
IN THAT BAG!
I'VE
HAD IT ROUGH TOO!
JUST A MINUTE.
WHICH ONE
ABDUCTED YOU?
THAT ONE, YOU JERK,
AND ABOUT 20 OTHERS.
WHERE ARE THEY?
DIG UP
THE NULLARBOR PLAIN.
ARE YOU OK?
[SIRENS]
WHEN YOU PAY $100
FOR A DINGO,
YOU EXPECT TO GET ONE.
JESUS! $100,000
WORTH OF DAMAGE.
YOU THOUGHT
I SLEPT WITH HIM.
WHERE WERE YOU?
I HAD A BAG
OVER MY HEAD.
THANK CHRIST
THEY SALVAGED THE MEAT.
NOW WHAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
HEAD UP NORTH,
SEE ABOUT GETTING A JOB.
OK.
THERE'S SOMETHING
I FORGOT TO TELL
THE POLICE.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
HANGING IN THE BACK

How are you?
Hello!
Yes, this is Harold Angel.
Yes, initial R, like in the phone book.
Excuse me?
Winesap.
Herman Winesap,
Winesap & Mackintosh?
Hold on a second!
Winesap from Winesap &...
Mackintosh. I've got it!
Of course I know what an attorney is.
It's like a lawyer, only the bills are bigger.
Sure, I'll hold.
Asshole!
Hello, Mr. Winesap? Harold Angel.
Yeah, I could be free.
Would this be with your firm?
Gimme that again.
Louis... how do you spell that?
Cyphre... okay.
What is it... foreign?
Is your client a foreigner?
Mr. Winesap, could you give me a few more details?
Okay, I know the place.
It's a long way up, but I can be there.
Hallelujah!
Show right now how much you love God!
I want you to show! It's your time!
Open up your hearts and open up your wallets!
Open your purses!
Open your pockets!
And give it up! Praise the Lord!
Somebody has been talking about me riding around in a Cadillac.
If you love me and want to give to me, then I should be in a Rolls-Royce!
Would you come with me, please?
An unfortunate husband of one of Pastor John's flock took a gun to his head. Most unpleasant.
Mr. Angel? Please?
Allow me to introduce my client,
Monsieur Louis Cyphre.
Hi, Harry Angel.
- Pleased to meet you, Mr. Angel.
I don't want to appear impolite, but do you have any I. D.?
- Sure! Here...
How's that?
GU N PERM IT
Nothing personal.
I'm a little over-cautious.
You know how these things are.
- I know. So...
How did you hear about me?
I guess you guys just looked in the phone book.
Usually that's what happens. Because my name is "Angel", it's under "A"...
People are lazy.
They see the first name and...
- Johnny Favorite.
Excuse me?
Do you by chance remember the name Johnny Favorite?
Johnny...
No, I don't think so.
You never knew him?
- Am I supposed to?
He was a crooner before the war, quite famous in his way.
Well, I tell you, Mr. Cyphre...
I'm sorry!
I usually don't get involved in anything very heavy. I usually handle insurance jobs, divorces, things of that nature.
If I'm lucky sometimes
I handle people. But I don't know no crooners or anybody famous.
- His real name was Liebling.
I don't know any Liebling, either.
What do you want from me?
Does this man owe you money?
- Not quite.
I helped Johnny at the beginning of his career.
You were like... his agent?
No!
Nothing so...
Monsieur Cyphre has a contract.
Certain collateral was to be forfeited in the event of his death.
You're talking about a guy that's dead?
- He was drafted in '43,
North Africa.
"Special Entertainment Services".
There was an attack, and his head and face was badly injured.
He had...
- Amnesia. I think you call it...
Shell shock.
- Exactly! - I know how that feels.
Why? Were you in the services?
- I was in for a short time.
But I got a little fucked up.
Excuse me! They shipped me home, and I missed the whole shebang:
The war, the medals, everything.
I guess you could say I was lucky.
Johnny wasn't so lucky.
He returned home a zombie.
His friends had him transferred to a private hospital upstate.
There was some sort of radical psychiatric treatment involved.
His lawyers had the power of attorney to pay the bills, things like that.
But you know how it is.
He remained a vegetable, and my contract was never honored. - I see.
I don't want to sound mercenary.
My only interest in Johnny is in finding out if he's alive or dead.
Each year my office receives a signed affidavit confirming that Johnny Liebling is indeed among the living.
But last weekend
Monsieur Cyphre and I, just by chance, were near the clinic in Poughkeepsie.
We decided to check for ourselves, but we got misleading information.
The run-around!
I didn't want to cause a scene,
I hate any sort of fuss.
I thought, perhaps you could subtly and in a quiet manner...
You want me to check it out.
- Check it out!
I have a feeling I've met you before.
I don't know, I don't think so.
Do you remember the name Johnny Favorite?
His real name was Liebling.
My only interest in Johnny is in finding out if he's alive or dead.
May I help you?
- My name is Harry Conroy from the National Institute of Health.
Is there anyone in particular you want to see?
The Institute is conducting a survey of incurable trauma cases.
I understand you have a patient here fitting that description?
We can't let you see anyone without an appointment.
I appreciate that, but maybe you could check the files and make sure I'm on the right track.
I don't want to bother anybody unnecessarily.
Okay? Thank you.
What's the name of the patient?
- Liebling, Jonathan Liebling.
One moment please, I'll check.
Were you working here last weekend?
No, day off.
- Did you do anything nice?
My sister's wedding.
We did have a Mr. Liebling, but he was transferred.
You sure?
- That's what it says.
And when was that?
- Years ago, in December '43.
May I take a look at this? Thanks.
Is this recent?
It's an old file.
- It's in ballpoint!
They weren't big on ballpoint in '43.
Is that ballpoint?
Well, I'll be!
They didn't have ballpoints back then?
No.
This here
Dr. Fowler, does he still work here?
- Just part-time, he's old.
Thank you.
Time for your evening fix?
Who are you?
How did you get in here?
Through the mailslot.
I'm a private detective.
Breaking and entering is a crime, whoever or whatever you are.
- Hey man, call the police!
Which you won't do in case they discover your opium den in the icebox!
I'm a doctor. I'm perfectly entitled to keep pharmaceuticals at home.
Tell it to somebody else!
We're not talking about a Band-Aid or a tube of unguent. How long you been hooked? - What do you want?
Information about Johnny Liebling.
I treated a patient of that name many years ago.
I'm not fooling around.
Either you give me some answers or I'll call the police myself.
I've seen the works cooking upstairs, and it ain't Mr. Salk's vaccine.
He was an entertainer during the war, a neuro case.
No chance of recovery, so I transferred him to a V.A. Hospital in Albany.
I hate to shake you up, but I checked, and he's not there.
You faked the transfer.
Because he recently had a visitor, the first in 12 years.
Popular guy, eh?
Where is he now?
- I don't know... - Come here!
I haven't seen him since he was a patient here.
You're in a cold sweat! Look at you!
You can't wait for me to leave so you can raid the icebox.
The sooner you get out with it, the sooner you can shoot up.
I'll ask you again: Where is he?
I don't know.
Some people came one night years ago.
He got in the car with them and left.
He got into a car?
I thought this guy was a vegetable.
At first he was in a coma but he quickly recovered.
But he still suffered from amnesia.
The friends.
Who were the friends?
- His name was Kelley, Edward Kelley.
The young lady I don't know.
She stayed in the car.
Where did they take him? - Down South.
The man said: "We're taking him home."
And what was the deal?
For what? - I was supposed to pretend that he was still a patient in hospital.
Didn't the administration suspect?
- Why should they? I kept the charts up to date. And no one asks questions when the bills get paid.
Tell me about Johnny Liebling.
What did he look like?
- No idea. His face was damaged.
He had facial reconstruction.
He was in bandages the day he left.
What can you tell me about Kelley?
It's too long ago.
I only have a vague memory.
He was well dressed and had a southern accent.
I truly don't remember.
- All right, Doc. Have a lie down.
I'm going out to grab a cheeseburger.
Maybe a few hours cold turkey will refresh your memory.
Watch yourself!
We're going to take a little nap, sit your ass down.
We're going to clear your mind.
I'm going out. When I get back,
I'll fix you some goodies from the icebox, alright?
Tell me what I want to know and you'll get rid of me forever.
I'm back, Doc!
I brought you a little something!
I didn't think you'd want a cheeseburger...
I will! Bye!
Hi, Ellie!
Is that your boyfriend?
He's got a car and everything?
See you later!
Did you see him?
- No.
Why not?
- It would've been difficult. - Why?
Why? Because he's not there.
Johnny Favorite walked out of the clinic 12 years ago, in his best suit, with a new face wrapped in bandages and a headache.
He left with a guy called Kelley and a girl.
Do you know this Kelley?
It seems this Kelley paid off some bent doctor called Fowler to pinch hit for your guy.
He's covered up for him all these years.
Looks like our Johnny has a perfect disappearing act.
- It seems so.
But you know what they say about slugs.
No, what do they say about slugs?
They always leave slime in their tracks.
You'll find him.
- No, I won't find him.
Because I left out one little detail.
This Dr. Fowler ended up dead with his fucking brains blown out.
Did you kill him?
- No!
But the cops might think I did.
I took on a $125-a-day missing persons job for you.
Now, I'm a murder suspect.
That's it! I'm out.
Such are the hazards of your profession.
If the fee bothers you, we'll adjust it.
You bother me!
The closest I ever come to death is watching a hearse go by on 2nd Avenue. That's the way I like it.
Are you afraid?
Yeah, I'm afraid.
I'll instruct my lawyer immediately to send you a check for $5,000.
If you don't want the job,
I'll engage someone else.
You want this Johnny pretty bad, eh?
I don't like messy accounts.
Some religions think the egg is the symbol of the soul, did you know that?
No.
Would you like an egg?
No, thank you.
I got a thing about chickens.
It's after eleven, you're late.
- I'm sorry.
You get it?
- If I lose my job,
I'll come and be your secretary.
I couldn't pay you what the "Times" pays. Besides, they won't miss it.
Hi, Johnny, where the fuck are you?
He really was a crooner, like you said.
I didn't realize he was so big.
He was in a band called the Spider
Simpson Orchestra. They're all dead.
Only Spider is here in town.
- Where? - I wrote it all down.
The dyke in the archive is suspicious.
My boss hasn't researched the story in years.
You can get the files.
Spider is in an old people's home on 138th Street.
Oh, I get to go to Harlem again.
There was a picture of Johnny with Toots Sweet, a guitar player.
No one's heard of him for years!
Johnny was engaged to a rich broad,
Margaret Krusemark.
Her dad owns half of Louisiana.
Met him at a high school prom. Johnny shit on her, and she went back to Daddy.
There's lots on their spells.
Spells, what do you mean, spells?
The eye of a newt, toe of a frog and that kind of shit?
- Seems she was a bit of a crackpot.
Casting spells at society do's and stuff.
Didn't go down too well with the lvy League stiffos.
She was known as the Witch of Wellesly.
Did I do good?
Great! So what've I got:
A religious loonie as a client.
I gotta find Johnny "Golden Tonsils" and we don't know where he is.
And he probably doesn't know who he is.
I got a geriatric bandleader in a home in Harlem.
I got a guitar player called Toots Sweet.
What else have I got?
A hard-on?
Are you okay?
January 3rd,
1955. Client: Louis Cyphre.
Copy: Winesap & Mackintosh, attorneys. As reported,
Johnny Favorite has not been in the Sarah Dodd Clinic in
Poughkeepsie for the last 12 years.
He was taken away by a man called Edward Kelley and a girl.
The girl is unidentified.
Kelley paid a Dr. Fowler $25,000 to falsify reports stating that Favorite was still in the hospital.
The doctor is now deceased.
Before Johnny's accident it seemed like his career was going great, until he started to dump on everyone.
I tracked down Spider Simpson,
Johnny's old bandleader. He resides at the Lincoln Presbyterian Hospice on 138th Street. Johnny also had a good buddy, a guitar player called Toots Sweet.
Toots went back to Algiers.
That's Algiers in New Orleans.
I think maybe Margaret went back there, and maybe Johnny, too.
Oh, yeah! According to Spider,
Johnny had a secret love.
A black lady called Evangeline Proudfoot.
Evangeline ran some kind of spooky store in Harlem called "Mammy Carter's."
You don't need to know that, Cyphre. I think a secret love should stay secret.
The only person who Johnny was seeing regularly was a palm reader in Coney Island called Madame Zora.
Are you lzzy?
Looks like the last bit of sun, eh?
The guy in the arcade over there told me you might be able to help me.
I'm looking for Madame Zora. - I know her, friend of the wife before the war.
She was a fortune teller, right?
- And then some!
I hate those hocus-pocus bitches!
Her and the wife got along real well.
Wife's a baptist. Oh, here!
Have a nose shield!
Go on, take one. I found a whole boxful under the boardwalk.
There's not much sun right now.
Yeah, but it keeps the rain off too.
Ever hear of a Johnny Favorite?
The singer?
- Yeah, he used to visit Madame Zora.
Heard of him, but don't know nothing.
Ask the wife.
She always sings stupid tunes off the radio. She knows all that shit.
She likes the water, eh?
- She hates it.
She's getting on the heavy side.
She thinks it's good for varicose veins.
Alright, thanks.
What do you do here in the summer?
Bite the heads off the rats.
And in the winter?
- The same.
Excuse me!
I was just talking to your husband.
I was inquiring about Madame Zora.
Yeah, I knew her before the war,
Madame Zora, you say?
Yeah, she was a gypsy fortune teller!
Had the booth across the boardwalk from me. She was a debutante not a gypsy, and she did more than just read tea leaves.
Did you ever see her with a guy called
Johnny Favorite? - Yeah, he was cute.
She was stuck on him. He was called
"Golden Tonsils". I knew all his tunes.
Have you ever heard of a Margaret Krusemark?
Don't be a gazoony, fellah!
Madame Zora was Margaret Krusemark.
Well what happened to her?
Packed up her stuff and went back home, down south.
You have any idea where I could find Johnny Favorite?
No, maybe the cemetery.
Want to hear one of his tunes?
Thanks for the nose shield.
I'm going to need it where I'm going.
In Brooklyn?
- Louisiana. - Nice.
Where'd he go?
FOR COLORED PATRONS ON LY
Mr. Angel? Sorry to keep you waiting, but you're a little early.
I had a bad line.
I didn't know if you said 4:00 or 4:30.
This is a wild place you got here!
- Yes, I've been very happy here.
I've never had my fortune read before.
Does it take long?
I'll take the details now. It usually takes a couple of days to do a chart.
Tea?
Do you want some tea?
Yes, thank you.
Darjeeling, jasmine or oolong?
Not many people like oolong.
Do you play the piano?
No, not exactly.
Sing?
I can carry a tune, but no... not really.
Who is this mean looking guy?
My father.
I'm sorry!
Don't worry, he hates it too.
He looks like one of those guys in an old pirate movie. What's his name?
Ethan.
- Ethan Krusemark...
Well, I tell you,
I never saw any of Ethan's movies.
Do you speak French?
I'm from Brooklyn.
I would prefer it if you didn't smoke.
- That's okay.
Cream or sugar?
Straight up is fine, thank you.
I need your exact date of birth.
Sure!
I was born on February 14th...
...1918, on Valentine's day.
How curious! I used to know a boy who was born on that exact same day.
Well, you know how it is, all the soldiers home on leave and all.
Maybe we could pull your friend's chart and save ourselves some time.
I don't think so. Every person is very different. I don't think you'd like his chart.
Place of birth?
Brooklyn, New York.
Was your friend a jerk or something?
You could say that.
I guess you didn't get along.
You and Johnny.
You and Johnny Favorite?
Who are you?
- I was an old army buddy.
I thought you two were kinda...
Look, I ain't no army buddy, I'm just a guy who was paid to snoop around.
To tell the truth,
I wasn't born on Valentine's day.
It's Johnny's future I'm interested in.
Johnny has no future, he's dead.
He died 12 years ago.
I'd like you to leave.
I know you're thinking who is this creep poking his snitch in everything.
I don't want to sound nosy, but...
- He's dead, Mr. Angel.
And if he isn't, he is to me.
He must've hurt you pretty bad!
We all have our scars.
I don't know too much about the guy, but he must've been stupid to let you go.
Lies and cruelty come very easily to some people.
Pity, I really would've liked to have gotten my palm read.
Then I could have held your hand just a little longer.
I don't think you'd like what I see.
Very pretty necklace!
You got any High John the Conquerer root?
- Powdered or hanging?
I'm not really sure.
Caught in the rain, eh?
Two roots, $1.20.
I have a question.
I had an acquaintance in Harlem who used to deal in the root.
Name was Evangeline. Heard of her?
Practically everyone around here is called Evangeline. After the poem.
Do you know it?
Yeah, I know it.
This acquaintance had a store in Harlem and it was the same name:
"Carter."
- Everybody uses the name, mister.
Like "Howard Johnson," but this is the real place.
Her name was Proudfoot.
Evangeline Proudfoot?
I knew her. She used to come back all the time when she lived in New York.
Do you know where she is now?
- She got sick and died.
She went back to the Holy Shelter swamp and was buried in Armandville.
She was waiting on some fellah.
- Just like in the poem? - Yep.
Who was the guy?
- She never told.
Okay, thanks.
A week, you say?
- At the most.
What is it?
Why are you crying?
We're going to Grandma. What's there?
Grandma.
Grandma.
Let's go.
Give me your hand.
I'm sorry!
I got these off a guy in Coney Island.
Some crazy guy.
I'm sorry.
Stop crying.
I was hoping
I could talk with your mother.
You're a little late.
Did you know her?
No, I never met her but I was hoping she could answer some questions for me.
Are you a cop?
No, my name is Harry Angel.
I'm a private detective.
So what's...?
- Epiphany.
Your mama left you with a very beautiful name.
And not much else.
Actually, I'm looking for a friend of your mother's, a guy called Johnny Favorite.
I met all her friends but never anyone called Favorite.
Shit!
I got a thing about chickens.
This Favorite was friends with your mother in New York city before the war.
Well, she never told me.
Mama had a lot of guys. She liked men.
How about a guy called Toots Sweet?
He was a friend of Favorite. Know him?
- No. - He was a good guitar player.
I was going to catch his act tonight.
I'm going to be staying in town, in a hotel.
If you remember anything that might help me, give me a call.
You're a very pretty girl, Epiphany, your name suits you.
These crazy chickens!
What are you after him for,
Johnny Favorite?
I'm not after him. I'm just being paid to find out where he is.
He could be 6 feet under.
- Then I'll have to buy a shovel.
How are you, sugar?
Some beautiful tune you were singing there, Mr. Sweet.
- Toots, son! Thanks. - Buy you a drink?
Mine's on the house. Special cocktail.
Whatever's in it gives a big kick.
You know, I heard you play years ago in New York.
Before the war at the old Dickie Wells Bar.
You were having it up pretty good with a guy called Johnny Favorite.
Yeah, I vaguely remember.
- You and he were buddies, weren't you?
No, he recorded one of my songs.
Say, are you a dick or a book writer?
Neither. I'm a journalist and I'm doing this piece about Johnny and the Spider Simpson Orchestra.
Spider played them drums like two jackrabbits fucking!
Haven't got much time. Got to piss, spit and get back to work.
Try one of those cocktails. Then you can make the whole thing up as you like.
That's what you usually do, anyway.
I can't even take a piss!
I just wanted to talk about Johnny
Favorite and Evangeline Proudfoot.
I'm too big to go hiding under beds.
I don't know nothing.
I'm only interested in cocktails. Fuck!
What's going on? - Nothing! Mind your own business. I want to piss!
Get outta here, or you'll wish your little white ass was never born.
Please! I've got a thing about chickens.
End of bullshit time!
I've had a good look at you and young Epiphany doing your hot shoe number with the chicken.
Listen!
I ain't up on this voodoo shit.
I'm from Brooklyn.
We ain't all Baptists here.
- What's with this Proudfoot girl?
She's a mambo priestess, like her mom.
Has been since she was 13.
When was the last time you saw
Johnny Favorite at a chicken dance?
He used to run around with Ma mambo.
- I ain't seen him since before the war.
And the chicken foot in the john?
- It means I got a big mouth.
It's not big enough.
What's this fucking star in your mouth? I'll tell you what.
I'll give you my hotel number.
Gimme a call if you hear anything.
You never know.
Next time you get a delivery of a chicken foot, you might need help.
As far as I'm concerned, any dead chicken is a good chicken.
Only cops and bad news don't knock.
Only private dicks sleep late.
Quite a dream you were having!
- I was on my way to Mandalay.
Shit! There's some leak up there!
Here! Is this your name?
That your hotel?
You're standing in it, ain't you?
- Your handwriting?
I think so.
Then perhaps you can tell us why we found it in the hand of a dead guitar player.
Toots Sweet is dead?
This one wasn't so quick, this one took time.
How did he die?
Technically?
Asphyxiation by his own genitalia.
And not so technically?
They cut his dick off and choked him with it.
Then redecorated his apartment with his blood.
When did you see him? - I interviewed him around 1:00. - About what?
A missing person.
Who?
A guy who took a walk 12 years ago.
There was a photo of him and Toots.
- Who is the party you're looking for?
I can't say.
I'm working for a New York lawyer.
Name?
- Come on, man!
Winesap!
You want his number, his address?
Ask Tess Truehart over there, it's in the book.
Under "W," genius! - Do you know
Ted Williams, the baseball player?
Alright, is that it, guys?
That's it.
You can go eat lunch, but don't stroll too far.
Not until we talk to this lawyer.
Ever watch the "Mickey Mouse Club?"
Do you know what today is?
Today is Wednesday.
It's "anything can happen" day.
Hey man, do you want a tune?
Yeah, I got a tune for you.
Hiya, boys!
Same to you.
I'm getting kinda hungry.
Do you want to sell some of those?
10 cents a sack.
- Sure, give me a sack.
Listen good! Margaret Krusemark's old man wants you on the first train home.
Take that fucking thing away from me!
Don't, or the dog will bite your fucking face clean off.
What happened to you?
A dog bit me.
So, what do you want?
Right now, I need a laundry.
Listen, Epiphiny...
- Epiphany.
There's something I want to ask you.
The other night I saw you and Toots boogying with the cock-a-doodle.
Looked like you were having some party.
What's your problem?
It's a free country.
Not for chickens.
- Oh yeah, your thing about chickens.
Listen, Toots is...
Toots is dead.
- I know, I heard.
You set him up.
- No, I didn't.
You were the only one that knew I was seeing Toots.
You sent the gift-wrapped chicken foot, didn't you?
Toots had a big mouth.
I guess he did, judging by what the cops found in it.
Quite a cute religion! - Nailing a man to a cross ain't so cute either!
You've got to kill the chicken to make the soup, eh?
We don't go around murdering people.
What about your Johnny Favorite?
Now you remember him after all.
- Yes, he was my father.
I'll pick the baby up later, okay?
- He'll be all right.
Anything you're holding out, now is a good time to tell.
Nothing to tell.
Johnny never came back from the war.
Mama waited and Mama died.
Sad and simple.
There's too many dead bodies floating around, even for Louisiana.
I'd tell your old man to look out for you.
You do have a husband?
- No.
No?
Jesus, you've got beautiful eyes!
Really.
The kind of eyes that tell what's going on inside.
Right now, you're scared.
- I'll manage.
Listen...
- Yes, I'll call you if I hear anything.
Call me if you don't.
Alright?
I have a message for you.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
I'm so glad you could come.
- I didn't know you were in town.
I'm speaking in Baton Rouge and thought
I'd catch up on your progress.
I'll tell you, the progress ain't too good.
I've found out a lot of stuff, but so far... no Johnny Favorite.
How unfortunate! - All I've got is a belly full of hocus-pocus and...
3 stiffs.
Dead bodies, Mr. Cyphre.
Murders.
I got Fowler, Johnny's doctor, bumped himself off.
This old voodoo guy Toots Sweet.
He got choked to death with a part of the body meant for pissing with...
This is a church!
The whole thing has to do with religion. It's very weird.
I don't understand it. It's ugly.
They say there's enough religion to make men hate each other but not love.
Do they say that?
I'll tell you something. There wasn't much love around for Johnny Favorite.
He was bad luck!
It's starting to rub off on me. I'm a murder suspect already in two cases.
The police found my name and my address in Toots Sweets' hand.
I know, Winesap told me.
You must be careful, Mr. Angel.
And the third murder?
I checked out Johnny's old society girlfriend, Margaret Krusemark.
Do you know her?
- Vaguely.
Vaguely? I'm a little fed up with fucking vaguely.
"Vaguely" is putting a noose around my neck and I'm choking, so...
Did you know her or not?
I knew about her, but I never actually knew her.
Tell you what, she was doing my chart.
I gave her Johnny's birthday,
February 14th.
Except someone got to her and took out their own Valentine's card.
They slit her open and cut out her heart.
I guess she couldn't predict the future for herself.
The future isn't what it used to be.
And your conclusions?
- I haven't any.
All I know is that Johnny is running around bumping off everyone he knew.
And more and more, it's me who's on the line for it.
I'm being set up and it's scaring the shit out of me.
So why don't you just level with me and tell me what the fuck is going on?
Just Johnny Favorite and the debt that's owed to me.
I have old-fashioned ideas, about honour.
An eye for an eye, things like that.
Who the fuck are you?
Watch your language!
I don't give a fuck, if this is a church.
I don't like churches.
- Are you an atheist?
Yes, I'm from Brooklyn.
I'll be in town for a day or two, let me know what else you find, and if you need more money...
- No!
But if I'm not careful, that 5,000 bucks you gave me could buy me a seat on the electric chair.
Frightened eyes never lie.
Come on! Come inside!
Where's your child?
- He's at Mincie's. She'll bring him.
She's got 14 of her own, so he'll be okay there.
You're welcome to stay here, or I can get you a room.
No, it's okay.
I'm going to have a drink. Want one?
Well, have one anyway.
I've been thinking...
What the hell did your mother see in a guy like Johnny Favorite?
I don't know. Whatever he had, it sure stole her heart away.
To tell you the truth, the guy was a creep.
She sure missed him.
What does a lady see in a guy who runs around chopping up pigeons?
They say it's always the bad-asses who make a girl's heart beat faster.
Did she ever say anything about him?
Just two things.
- What?
That Johnny Favorite was as close to true evil as she ever wanted to come.
What else?
That he was a terrific lover.
How old are you?
Kind of young to have a kid, isn't it?
Old enough.
Where did the father go?
- I never knew him.
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I took this room.
I can't believe this!
It was a Bambouche. When spirits possess you, it's called "chevalier."
I know that: Chevrolet.
Chevalier. - That's what I said:
Chevrolet. - Mounted by the gods.
So the gods got you pregnant?
I understand now. I'm sorry.
I'm not.
It was the best fuck I ever had.
Want to dance?
Here?
Yes, here.
I got bit by a dog this morning,
I can't move around.
You won't feel a thing.
Alright, I'll dance with you.
But you've got to promise.
- What's that? - No chickens!
Alright, I'm coming!
I should've recognised the knock.
At least you got a reason for sleeping late.
Down here we don't mess with jigaboos.
The colored folks keep to themselves.
I'm not from down here.
- You cut yourself?
Dog bit me.
Somebody called Margaret Krusemark figure in your missing persons case?
No, why? - She's dead.
That nigger guitar player of yours, he didn't matter a shit. He was into voodoo, they 86 each other every week.
But this Krusemark dame, she comes from a Louisiana money family.
Two people bumped off in a week, what's the connection?
Similar circumstances!
Did she have her dick cut off too?
- No!
Some fucker cut her heart out, neat as a butcher.
Look, mine's a missing persons, it's not a murder.
I want the name of the party you're looking for. - Talk to the lawyer.
I did. A fancy mouthpiece, gave me the same big city shit as you.
What should I say? Why don't you and
Effie Klinker just fuck off and leave me alone?
- You ass-wipe!
You play jump rope with Louisiana law and I'm going to stick your big city smarts right up your New York ass.
This Krusemark was into black magic and all that shit.
Nothing is worse for a cop than people who get killed for nutso reasons.
Sorry about the mess.
Maybe your nigger can clean it up.
What are you singing?
It's by Johnny Favorite.
My mother used to sing it all the time.
You okay?
Shit!
What do you want, Mr. Angel?
I thought you knew.
- Why should I?
Two of your morons with a matching poodle have been chasing me for days.
I'm looking for Johnny Favorite.
As far as I know, that dance band scumbag is dead.
That dance band scumbag probably killed your daughter.
Who is employing you?
- I can't say.
I'll pay.
- So do they.
12 years ago, you and your daughter snatched Favorite from the nut hatch.
You gave a junkie doctor 25 grand to pretend Johnny was still there.
You did a good job until a week ago.
You used the name Edward Kelley.
Let's go over here. It's a little private and you can sample our Gumbo.
I've got an acid stomach.
Cajun cooking kills me.
Pity about your stomach!
You'd have enjoyed our Gumbo.
I was Edward Kelley.
It was me who paid Fowler the 25 grand.
Did Favorite know you?
- No.
He acted like a sleep walker. He looked out of the window at the lights.
Where were you taking him?
- Times Square. New Years Eve, '43.
We dropped him off in the crowd, and he disappeared forever.
Or so we thought.
You're telling me you paid 25 grand for a guy and lost him in a crowd?
I did it for my daughter.
Some sort of hocus-pocus she and Johnny were fooling with. She was obsessed.
I know,
I found a mummified hand in her room.
The hand of glory.
It's supposed to open any lock.
It was the right hand of a murderer, cut off while his neck was in the noose.
That's what Margaret believed.
Black magic! - Black, white, what's the difference? Margaret was always...
Evil.
- Evil as a dunghill.
Everyone speaks about someone else.
Margaret wasn't evil.
She was a strange kid! She was into
Tarot cards before she could read.
Who got her started?
- Some maid, or governess, who knows.
Everything you tell me is a crock of shit!
You got her started!
You're a devil worshipper! - The Prince of Darkness protects the powerful.
Shit!
- I can't help if you don't believe it.
Come straight with me, you slime-bag, or I'll save the state an execution!
I introduced
Johnny Favorite to my daughter.
I watched him conjure up Lucifer in my home. He was deeper in it than me.
He made a pact with Satan.
He sold his soul.
You expect me to swallow that?
- I don't give a damn!
That's a crock of shit, you lying toad!
He sold his soul for stardom.
- For stardom?
Satan rose from the depths.
But he tried to outwit the Prince of Darkness.
When he made it big, he tried to duck out of it.
That's a crock of shit!
Johnny found an obscure rite in an ancient manuscript. He needed a victim.
Someone his own age. - Why?
- To steal their soul.
Toots and Johnny picked up a young soldier.
Who?
- Just a soldier celebrating New Year's Eve in New York.
They took him back to Johnny's hotel, where they had the ceremony.
What ceremony?
The boy was bound naked on a rubber mat, there were complicated incantations.
A pentacle was branded on his chest.
Margaret gave Johnny a virgin dagger.
He sliced the boy clean open and ate his heart.
It was still beating when he wolfed it down.
Johnny wanted to become that soldier.
Before he had worked it out, he was drafted, injured and sent home without even knowing who he was.
Who was the boy?
Only Johnny knew. He put the dog tags in a vase and gave it to Margaret.
It was Margaret's plan to drop him off in Times Square.
The last place he remembered before it happened.
He needed a victim.
Someone his own age.
To steal their soul.
He sliced the boy clean open and he ate his heart.
Who was the boy?
Johnny wanted to be the soldier.
Maybe he gained the guy's soul, but he still looked like Johnny to me.
I know who I am!
Alas...
How terrible is wisdom if it brings no profit to the wise, Johnny.
Louis Cyphre...
"Lucifer!"
Even your name is a dime store joke.
"Mephistopheles" is such a mouthful in Manhattan, Johnny.
Do you think posing as the devil, just because it scared a superstitious old guitar player, and that witch, and that nutty old man, do you think it's going to scare me?
It ain't, because I know who I am.
You killed them, and you're trying to pin it on me.
I know who I am.
If I had cloven hooves and a tail, would you be more convinced?
You're crazy.
I know who I am.
You're trying to frame me.
You're trying to frame me.
I know who I am. You murdered them people! I never killed nobody!
I didn't kill Fowler,
I didn't kill Toots, and I didn't kill Margaret or Krusemark.
I killed no one.
I'm afraid you did, Johnny.
- My name's not Johnny!
All killed by your own hand.
Guided by me, naturally.
You were doomed from the moment you slit that young boy in half.
You've been living on borrowed time and another man's memories for 12 years.
I want to tell Winesap, he knows!
- He's dead.
Nasty accident!
Don't worry, no one will mourn one less lawyer. Death's everywhere these days.
But what gives human life its worth, anyway?
Because someone loves it, hates it.
The flesh is weak.
Only the soul is immortal.
And yours belongs to me!
I know who I am.
That's it Johnny, take a good look!
However cleverly you sneak up on the mirror, your reflection always looks you straight in the eye.
- I know who I am.
I know who I am!
Why did you come back?
I live here.
Who is she?
She ain't: Angel, Harold.
She's my daughter.
Bullshit! Who is she?
Epiphany Proudfoot.
She stayed here for a little while.
Long enough for you to kill her?
Or ain't that your gun up her snatch?
You're going to burn for this.
I know.
In hell!
Where did you find that garbage?
Tell me!
It's disgusting!
You're just like your father.
Tits! That's all he ever cared about!
You think he was a hero, don't you?
I could tell you a thing or two about him.
I'll kill you if I find this garbage in the house again.
Get the trash can.
I'm burning it all.
Don't just stand there, stupid!
Come on!
I'll bet the bastard showed it to his son so he'd grow up to be just like him.
That pig.
I'm sure he's got more filth in here.
Don't be stupid! Get the trash can!
Hurry up!
- What's in here?
- It's his room.
- My God.
- Whoever did this is completely crazy.
It's terrible.
I've never seen so much blood.
There must be something in here.
It's Mrs. Weldon.
I knew it.
I knew something terrible had happened.
- My God!
- Please escort her.
Don't worry, I'm okay.
Back.
- It was a very big man.
- Timmy.
- Very big!
- Take it easy, Timmy.
Where's his dad?
He died in Europe.
He was in the Air Force.
But he's got an aunt who lives nearby.
I'll call her and go get her.
It's horrible.
Mom?
Where are you?
Mom, come back!
Are you gonna be a while?
I'll go somewhere else.
Only a moment, miss.
All right.
Just a moment, gentlemen.
The dean will be with you shortly.
Don't worry. We're used to it.
Did you know that girl?
Well, I'm not sure.
This is a very big university and it's hard to remember all the students.
- Yes, sir?
- Are the gentlemen still there?
- Yes, sir.
- All right, I'll be right out.
Okay.
You must be Bracken.
- Lieutenant Bracken.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Sergeant Holden.
- How do you do, Sergeant?
- How do you do?
- Come in, please.
Grace, hold all my calls, please.
After you.
What a terrible matter.
You guys heard the latest?
They installed a water bed in the gym.
How about that?
You ever slept on a water bed?
The coolest feeling in the world... is smoking a joint while having sex in a water bed.
Watch out! There he is.
Watch this.
Professor Brown?
I'm sorry, sir. Can I ask you a question?
Where are the pectoral muscles?
My classmates say that mine are pretty funny.
I can assure you there's nothing the matter with yours.
Yes, but where are they?
Here. Right here.
We need be discreet. What happened was just an unfortunate accident-
That murder is simply horrible.
The police are inside. They think it was somebody from this university.
I won't ask how you came across that piece of information.
What makes you think that?
Well, the lieutenant says it looks like an inside job.
Poor Willard. He found the body.
But they still haven't found the head.
I wonder what the killer could've done with it.
- You know, I'll bet-
- Are they going to be a while?
I don't know, Professor.
They've been in there for quite some time, so it can't be long.
But if you prefer to come back later-
Get Professor Brown, Grace.
He's probably in the teachers'lounge.
He's right here, sir.
Should I send him in?
Great. Yes, send him in.
According to our current records, we have over 2000.
I'm glad you're here, Arthur.
This is Inspector Bracken, and Sergeant Holden.
Pleased to meet you.
I'd like you to show them around.
When is your next class?
- Tomorrow, actually.
- Tomorrow? Great.
They want to ask you some questions about that girl, Virginia Palmer.
She was in your class, if I remember correctly.
Professor Brown is the head of our anatomy department.
Please, show them anything they wish to see.
And feel free to come back and see me if you need anything else.
Now...
I ask that you be discreet.
Imagine what it would mean for the university... if all of this became front page news.
Don't worry.
That wouldn't help us either.
We'll be discreet.
I'm sure you'll agree that it must have been an unfortunate accident.
Although these things always end up becoming public, it's important right now is to gain time.
I've said enough already, and I've got work to do.
I don't think
I'll be of much help to you.
I don't remember the girl too well.
I've had a lot of students this trimester.
Come on, Arthur.
You're only in charge of one department, while I'm in charge of the whole campus.
I'm sure you'll do a better job than me.
Gentlemen, you'll have to excuse me. My apologies.
Professor Brown will show you out.
Thank you, sir.
You've been a great help.
I appreciate it.
Please keep me up to date.
Of course, don't worry about it.
So you didn't know the girl too well?
- Got a light?
- No, I don't.
Any idea what kind of girl she was?
Did she chase boys?
She was very attractive, but I don't remember her having a boyfriend.
This is my classroom. Come in.
We study comparative anatomy for its use in anthropology and the like.
A present from one of my students.
I don't know where he found it.
It's the skull of a 16-year-old girl.
I'd like to talk to that kid.
What's his name?
That was a long time ago.
Surely, you don't think one of our students killed her.
Our job is like identifying garments which are missing their tags.
We have to check everything.
Did that girl have many friends in her class?
Yes, she was very popular.
If you come to my office, I'll give you some names that might help you.
Thank you very much, Professor.
We have to start somewhere, and we don't even have the coroner's report.
All right.
Willard?
Tell me, Willard. When do you think your work will be done here?
Well, I'm not sure.
Probably in another week or two.
But don't worry.
It won't cost you any more.
That's the deal
I made with your secretary.
- It's all included in the price.
- Yes, it's all included, I know that.
But the sooner you're done, the sooner you can start work somewhere else.
And I assume that's in your best interest, isn't it?
- I'll finish as soon as I can.
- Good. All right.
How about a little dip in the pool by ourselves?
- Hi. How are you?
- Leaving already?
Yes, I have to study.
Brown is real tough.
Look, there he is. He's so weird.
He's always by himself.
So sexy!
- All right, see ya.
- Bye.
Kendall?
- Have you seen Kendall?
- Yeah, he's right there.
Thanks.
By the way, are you free this afternoon?
All right, that's what I was saying.
You're not free.
Kendall, I finally found you.
This is for you.
- What is that?
- How am I supposed to know?
I just know it's urgent.
Where the heck were you?
I've been looking all over campus.
You weren't here before.
Alistair, when did they give you this?
About half an hour ago.
Half an hour? That's weird.
When it comes to keeping a secret, my lips are sealed.
- Yeah, I know.
- See ya later.
Grab him!
Hold it!
Don't move, or I'll blow your brains out.
What a tough line of work to be in.
Nobody realizes just how horrible it is.
Thanks for coming so quickly, Professor.
Hank? Bring that over here.
I need your help.
I still don't have the coroner's report... and I need to know right now if this- this bloodbath-was caused... by that chainsaw.
Don't touch that!
You might erase some of the prints.
Sorry, I didn't realize that.
I'm not exactly a pathologist, but...
I could almost guarantee that it was caused by this chainsaw.
Or by something very similar.
All right, Professor.
We'll be in touch. You can go now.
Thank you.
Sergeant, do those kids know
I want to see them?
- Yes, they know.
- Good, let's go talk to the dean.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. Just a feeling.
This case is driving me crazy.
Me too. I've got the strange feeling that somebody's watching me.
What we really need here are a couple of undercover officers.
I'll mention it to the dean.
- Women, right?
- Yes, of course.
That's all the killer's interested in.
All right, I'll see ya.
Just a second, kid. And you too.
The lieutenant wants to see you at the dean's office in half an hour.
All right, I'll make sure he comes with me.
- Don't worry, we'll be there.
- I hope so, for your sake.
- And not a word of this.
- All right.
Yeah, man. We know.
We're absolutely certain that person is on campus.
You surely don't think it's one of my students or teachers.
It could be anybody.
Do you want to cooperate or not?
You want to place two female officers here to spy on us.
I think you're asking too much.
We've had two murders.
And now that maniac is going to kill again.
I assure you it's the only way to catch him.
Yes. Of course.
I understand.
When do you want to start?
I'll let you know.
Now I'd like to ask your secretary and those two kids some questions.
Don't tell them you couldn't find me the first time you went to the library.
- You know how cops are.
- You think I'm stupid?
- Where were you?
- With Alice. You know her?
The blond chick? Really? Her too?
- Of course. Nothing to it.
- You're amazing.
- You gotta share that recipe.
- If you behave.
Let's see, if I'm not mistaken... you found an envelope on your desk... addressed to Kendall with the word "urgent" written on it.
Yes, and I gave it to the dean right away.
Didn't I, sir?
And what did you do?
I'm sorry, but is all this really necessary, Lieutenant?
Maybe you should ask that to the parents of the murdered girls.
Yes, I understand.
It's natural.
You see, I instructed Grace, my secretary... to send the letter to Kendall urgently.
Urgently? Why?
I can't tolerate my office being used as a post office.
The students know that... and they keep bothering Grace with all their nonsense, love letters and that sort of thing.
Nevertheless, when I found the letter on my desk...
I assumed that what it said on the envelope was true: "Very urgent."
I'm sorry, sir.
I never imagined thatJenny... would use your office for something like that.
You're wrong, kid.
It wasn't her. The killer sent that note to keep you away from the pool.
Why did you go?
I really don't know.
I had a hunch.
I felt something strange.
Something I can't explain, Lieutenant.
Yeah.
What about you? You know anything?
Me? Not a word, I swear.
Okay.
But I don't want you to mention this conversation to anyone.
- Understood?
- Understood.
Give me a call when you feel better.
- There's somebody I'd like you to talk to.
- All right.
I don't have any more questions.
What about you?
One, two, three, four.
And one, two, three... four, five, six, seven... eight.
All right.
- I'm going to step out for a sec.
- All right.
What's the matter?
You scared me to death.
You came out so suddenly.
Come on.
I want to tell you something.
Come in.
- Hi, Doctor.
- Would you stop calling me that?
I'm a psychologist, not an MD.
- Is this the kid?
- Hey, I don't need a shrink.
Come here.
I'm not a shrink, young man.
And I'm sure you don't need me.
Calm down.
The doctor just wants some information.
- About what?
- My name is Jennings.
I'm a psychologist, as you've just heard.
It's my job to prepare a detailed psychological profile... of the possible killer.
In many cases, his psychological profile is all we have to go on.
But I don't know anything.
Or do I?
Exactly.
You might know the killer without being aware of it.
Now, if the lieutenant is kind enough to carry on with his work... we'll try to make some sense of things.
All right. I'll see you later, huh?
- Bye.
- Have a seat.
Is he dangerous?
Very.
Good. I'm sick of being bored to hell in this damn office.
I imagined as much. Find an active girl, make her fill out forms all day long... and six months later she'll volunteer for just about anything.
- Dr. Jennings is done with me.
- It wasn't that bad, was it?
- Hey, aren't you Mary Riggs?
- The one and only.
- Mary Riggs, Kendall James.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
I've seen almost all your matches.
What's a tennis champ doing here?
It's quite simple. This is my home.
Are you saying you work here?
Of course.
She's the woman I spoke to you about.
She'll be working undercover at the university.
- She'll be the new tennis teacher.
- That's great!
I really appreciate your trust in me, Lieutenant.
And yours too, of course.
Kendall, all you have to do... is keep your eyes peeled... and stay close to Miss Riggs in case she needs help.
- All right?
- All right.
He's a good kid, and he's been through a lot.
We've had a good talk, and I think we can trust him.
That's just fine.
But why did you tell him about me?
We've hit a dead end.
I don't have anyone to protect you.
I trust him.
I'd trust him with my own life.
And mine too, of course.
I can't see why you're complaining.
You'll be playing tennis every day, playing tennis till you're worn out.
- In the mean time, we'll be watching.
- I need to speak to the lieutenant.
I'm really sorry, but that's impossible right now.
- I have orders. You understand-
- I've been calling all morning.
Let her in.
- What is it?
- I was waiting for you, Lieutenant.
Do you have a minute?
- Who are you? It's okay.
- Sylvia Costa. Boston Globe.
What's going on at the university?
What's going on at the university?
What could possibly be going on?
There are rumors going around about some strange incidents.
Apparently, there's a maniac on the loose, or something similar.
Look, miss. Rumors like that go around every single day of the year.
Yes, but this time they seem to be true.
There's even talk about a murdered girl.
The students' imagination knows no bounds.
I'm sorry, but I'm very busy.
Will you excuse me?
But-
Why don't you talk to Miss Riggs?
She's the one that's up to date on all that stuff.
Forty-fifteen.
Game, Miss Riggs.
Six-three, third set.
Well done, Miss Riggs.
You were marvelous.
- Just marvelous!
- Thank you very much.
We're serving tea in the teachers' lounge.
I'm sure you could use a little.
Yes, but I'd like to shower first.
That girl gave me a good workout.
Please, Miss Riggs, don't be modest.
I'm sure with your teaching... our tennis team will improve tremendously in very little time.
Tell me, does anyone suspect anything?
Anybody know why I'm here?
Not a soul- except for those the lieutenant has confided in.
Good, then you're the only one.
I'd like to talk to you later.
- Is that possible?
- Yes, of course.
But, tell me, where's the other young lady?
I don't see her anywhere.
Well, I'm on my own.
These jobs are for volunteers.
You're brave, Miss Riggs.
I hope you're capable of performing your job with discretion.
That is very important.
By the way, where's Willard?
We had to let him go.
We don't have any evidence against him.
Excuse me, sorry to interrupt.
Can I talk to you for a moment?
I'm afraid that's impossible right now.
I'm busy.
It's about the incidents that have occurred lately.
I don't know a thing about that.
There's nothing strange going on here.
There's nothing going on, is there, dear?
Please excuse us. We're in a big hurry.
Who's there?
It's you. You scared me.
What's going on here?
What are you doing?
- The key! Where's the damn key?
- We don't have a key.
I'll go in through the window and open the door.
Come on!
Hurry up!
Get help. Quick. Come on!
Use that phone right there.
If the door is locked, knock it down!
Damn bastard.
- What happened?
- He cut a girl's arms off.
And we weren't able to catch that son of a bitch.
Calm down. We'll get him this time.
Sergeant, make sure they search every square inch of this building.
- I will.
- Every square inch, got it?
Don't worry.
- Doctor, how is she?
- It's hard to say.
She's alive, but she's lost a lot of blood.
Her condition is critical.
I don't think she'll make it.
God!
That son of a bitch is probably laughing at us.
What happened?
- Where did you come from?
- What?
Are you deaf?
I asked you where you came from.
- Upstairs, from the library.
- All right.
We'll talk later. Kendall.
Sir, something horrible has happened.
Listen, kid. We have patrol cars everywhere, but that's not enough.
You need to keep your eyes open and your ears peeled.
We need your help.
And above all, I ask that you don't let Miss Riggs out of your sight.
I shouldn't have to ask you this, but I can't afford to let that damn maniac get away again!
Go on, get out of here.
Randall, I want a full check of all the employees.
A thorough check.
- Use the whole department if you need to.
- Very well, Lieutenant.
I thought you'd like that.
Try to do your best.
It won't be long before this madman gets back to work.
Shut up!
Don't you realize? You're going to wake the whole campus up.
And you're the one that was afraid of getting caught? You're unbelievable.
- Oh, Kendall.
- What the heck?
Why do women always end up crying?
Get off me!
You're all the same.
As soon as you get what you want, you forget all about us.
What are you doing?
You're leaving now?
- Miss Riggs?
- It's you.
- Miss Riggs.
- You scared me to death.
- What happened here?
- I don't know.
I thought I saw someone running through the garden.
Hey, it's my kung fu teacher.
What are you doing here?
Well, I was jogging and I was attacked all of a sudden.
But I can see everything's okay.
Good night.
- Bye.
- Bye.
What are you doing out here so late?
The lieutenant asked me to keep an eye on you.
I saw you go out, but when
I got downstairs, you were gone.
- So I got the bike.
- Next time, forget the bike.
It sounds just like a chainsaw.
- Well, since you're okay, I'll go.
- No way, Kendall!
I'll grab my gun and leave with you.
All right.
Get on.
Hold on!
Well, thanks a lot... for saving my life tonight.
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Mary?
How about a drink?
Some other time.
Thanks.
Casanova!
You?
Willard?
- Who put that music on? It's unbearable!
- They must be testing it out.
I thought that was your job.
No, ma'am.
I just take care of the garden.
The PA system is controlled from the dean's office.
Kendall, call and ask them if someone's testing the system.
There's a phone in the locker room, if Willard's got the key.
Using that phone is against the rules.
I'll take responsibility for it.
Wait for me there.
- How do you stop that?
- How do I know?
That damn music is driving me crazy!
Willard, isn't there some way we can stop the music?
I'll try. Come with me.
Let's go.
What about that key?
Don't touch it.
It could be evidence.
If something happened, I mean.
Kendall?
Kendall, where are you?
What happened?
Another one. In there.
It's Susie Billing!
Right!
While we were distracted by the music... that bastard was killing her!
Monster!
Monster!
He cut her in two while she was still alive.
Do you realize how much that girl must have suffered?
Sergeant, we're running out of time.
I know, Lieutenant. I know.
And I'm doing everything I can.
But if I move too quickly,
I may overlook something important.
- You've gotta give me more time.
- That's what we don't have.
Make a special effort, don't sleep, anything! But give me a lead.
Lieutenant, I'm doing everything I can, but I'd like to have some help.
I can't stay up all night.
My eyes are so tired, I can't read anymore.
I think I can get you some help.
You remember Kendall?
That kid could be a great help to us.
Are you kidding?
We can't use a suspect for this.
What kind of nonsense is that?
That kid knows everyone.
He's been in this university for five years... and he would notice anything weird way before anyone else.
Yes, Lieutenant, I know that.
But the rules-
To hell with the rules.
We have to find the killer.
That's what the rules say.
So Kendall will be there in half an hour.
Don't worry, Mom. I'll fix it.
Professor? Professor Brown?
Do you mind if I walk with you?
I'm a little nervous after what happened.
In broad daylight, in the middle of campus,
I don't think you have too much to fear.
I'm going to Horton Hall.
Is that on your way?
Yes, of course.
I'm sorry, you must think I'm silly, but after what I saw-
No, not at all.
I'm used to seeing cadavers... and maybe I'm desensitized.
Unlike the dean, you seem like a sensitive man.
I think you're not at all familiar with campus politics.
Why do you say that?
In order to survive on a campus like this one, you need to be very tough.
I'm not one to stand in the dean's way.
I'm sure I wouldn't fare too well.
That sounds like the voice of experience, a bitter experience.
I say it the way I see it.
- Tell me more.
- I have nothing more to say.
Miss Riggs...
I don't like people who pry into other people's private affairs.
I just want to know what I've gotten myself into, Professor.
Especially with a maniac on the loose.
- It's me.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous, that's all.
Where were you?
The lieutenant asked me to help
Sergeant Holden check the records.
Well, well.
The lieutenant doesn't play by the book.
Well-
You know where I can find the dean?
He won't be back until this afternoon.
He goes to Arlington on the first of every month.
But you'll find him in his residence around 7:00 p.m.
At 7:00? Good, I'll go see him then.
- As you wish.
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Hi. What are we going to start with today?
Oh, our police apprentice.
Well, I hope you still like this job... after reading reports for 10 hours.
- You don't smoke, do you?
- No. Why? Does it bother you?
Yeah, I can't stand smoke.
Especially being stuck down here.
Well, you know how it works:
Read each report carefully... and take note of any reference to members of the university, all right?
And that's your desk.
Okay.
Well, Miss Riggs. What a surprise.
- I'm sorry. I don't want to bother you.
- Please, come in.
I only wanted to ask you some questions.
Certainly, but if you insist on staying here... we'll just have to make ourselves comfortable.
It is a little silly, isn't it?
This way.
Can I offer you anything?
I was making some tea, but maybe you'd prefer coffee.
Yes, coffee, please.
You have a very nice apartment.
Thank you.
You're very kind.
I don't hear that often.
It's a little big for one person.
Make yourself comfortable, dear.
Give me just a second, please.
Miss Riggs, how do like your coffee?
With milk and sugar?
Milk and no sugar.
Maybe a little saccharine.
I see you look after your figure.
I wouldn't think you'd need to with so much tennis.
I'll put a little in.
Just a moment.
Here I am, dear.
Sorry for taking so long.
Here's your coffee.
I don't know if you'll like it.
It's instant coffee.
Thank you.
I put a little saccharine in there, like you asked.
It tastes great. It's delicious.
You're very kind.
I'm glad you like it.
And now, Miss Riggs, tell me.
What did you want to talk about?
About Professor Brown.
- Professor Brown.
- Yes.
Do you know if he has any problems, something he'd like to hide?
I hate asking questions like this, but it's absolutely necessary.
Would you like some more coffee?
Yes.
It was very good.
If we don't find something soon...
I think they're going to investigate everyone on campus.
Frankly, I don't want to see this university crawling with cops... looking for bodies everywhere.
It would be pretty unpleasant.
Sergeant... this looks important.
He changed his name.
It's no big deal, but we better find out why.
I'll call the Arlington archive.
I hope someone's there... even though it is a bit late.
Arlington?
This is Sergeant Holden, in Boston.
I need an enlargement of file 672947-HF.
It's urgent.
Yes, I'll hold.
You better keep working.
This will take a while.
It's an old guy who sounds like he's about to drop dead.
Yeah, go ahead. Yes.
Are you sure?
Can you send me a telex with that information right now?
To our central office.
It's very urgent.
Yes, I understand. That'll be all.
Thank you.
What did he say?
We've got him.
I'm positive the dean is the killer.
Apparently... his mother was chopped to pieces when he was a kid... and that must have left him disturbed.
I imagined it was something like that.
Mary said she was going to go see the dean at 7:00.
Good Lord.
Why didn't you tell me? Let's go!
- No, stay here and call the lieutenant.
- Yes.
What am I saying?
No! There's no time to lose.
We'll use the radio. Come on, Kendall.
I hope we get there in time.
I'm sorry. The water got cold and I had to reheat it again.
- Thank you very much.
- Your coffee.
We were talking about
Professor Brown.
He's a homosexual.
I found out by chance several years ago.
But, for now, he hasn't broken any rules... and, therefore, that's entirely his business.
Don't you think, dear?
Brown was really worried... about me knowing his little secret... and he tried to destroy me.
But I'm stronger than him.
I don't feel well.
I feel really weird.
You're feeling the effects of the drug I've just given you.
You can see and hear everything I'm saying, can't you?
But you can't move, can you?
Lieutenant?
- Lieutenant.
- What?
An urgent telex.
It's about the crimes at the university.
It looks like they found out who the killer is.
Tell Rogers to get my car right away!
Nobody will ever find you. Ever!
Sergeant!
Hold on.
You two go around the back.
Let's go.
That way.
Kendall, you stay put here.
Lieutenant, you can't do this to me now.
All right, but stay back.
If somebody shouts "Down!", hit the dirt like a soldier, okay?
Yes, sir.
Get away from there!
Hold it.
Mary?
What's wrong? For God's sake, what did he do to you?
- The dean's not here.
- We need to find him. He can't be far.
Kendall, stay with her.
I'll radio for an ambulance.
Come on, Mary.
Mary, please.
You need to walk now. Come on.
Snap out of it. Get up.
Please. Come on, get up!
Come on. It's all over.
Please.
That's it, I'll help you up.
There you go.
That's it, Mary.
Now you have to walk.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
What you have to do now... is walk a little.
That's it. There you go.
You're doing great, Mary.
Come on.
- Are you okay, kid?
- Yeah.
- You're lucky.
- No kidding.
How's Mary?
She'll recover soon.
She's just drugged.
Bring something to cover him.
Sergeant?
We're going to search everything here.
Mary.
- Take a look at this.
- Let's see.
It's horrible, isn't it?
I wouldn't say that.
She's not that bad-looking.
I never imagined the dean collected things like this.
- Who would of thought?
- As you see, you learn something new every day.
Hurry it up.
Where's the lieutenant?
- He left with Miss Riggs.
- All right. You can go.
- How are you feeling?
- Pretty good.
- You still want to be a cop?
- You kidding?
Come on, let's go.
I'll buy you a coffee.
You can rest easy.
You helped avenge their deaths. Let's go.
Just a second.
CHILD: ...34, 35, 36, 37,
- Killer is coming.
- CHILD 2: The killer is coming.
CHILD 3:
Killer is coming. Watch out, Kelly.
CHILD 1: I hear you.
CHILD 2: Hey, Nick! Missed you.
CHILD 1: Here, killer's here.
CHILD 3: Killers are coming, killers are coming.
(ALL CHANTING) Killers are coming.
Killers are coming.
Killers are coming.
CHILD 2: Kill! Kill! Kill!
CHILD 1: Wendy, you're it.
WENDY:
All right, but I'll kill you all.
- Hey, this way.
The killer is coming.
The killer's gonna get you.
(STUTTERING) L-look, Kim.
It's Nick.
Nick!
He's an idiot.
KIM: Where's my geography book? Darn.
I've got to go back for it.
Robin, you and Alex go on.
Come on.
Come on, they don't want you in their game.
Well, I'm not waiting.
ROBIN: A-Alex...?
- (CLATTERING)
- (CHILD SCREAMING)
Kill! Killer's got you.
There!
The killer's gonna get you, Kelly.
- (SCREAMS)
- Shut up.
- GIRL: Killer's got you, Kelly.
- (GIGGLING)
- Now you've done it.
- WENDY: We know you're up here, Nick.
- (CHILDREN GIGGLING)
- The killers are coming.
Here, killers, here.
(STUTTERS) P-p-please.
ALL: Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill.
Kill! Kill! Kill!
(CHANTING) Killers are coming.
Killers are coming.
Killers are coming.
Killers are coming.
Killers are coming.
Killers are coming... killers are coming.
Killers are coming... killers are coming.
Killers are coming... killers are coming.
Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill.
Kill. Kill.
Kill. Kill!
Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill.
Kill! Kill!
(STUTTERS) P-p-please.
I d-d-didn't want to p-play.
Kill! Kill!
Kill, kill!
Kill. Kill...!
Kill, kill!
Kill! Kill!
Kill, kill!
Kill, kill...
Kill! Kill!
We've got to get somebody, quick.
Are you crazy?
They'll put us in jail.
If we tell anyone they'll say it's our fault.
Who'd believe it was an accident?
- But what if...
- WENDY: Listen to me.
We'll go home now and never, ever tell anyone.
No one but us will ever know.
- Jude, swear?
- I swear.
- WENDY: Kelly? Kelly!
- I don't want to go to jail.
WENDY: Swear?
I swear.
- Nick? Nick!
- I'll never tell.
- Good. Let's go.
- (PANE CREAKING)
(MALE VOICE ECHOING) Probably the victim of a sexual attack.
MALE VOICE: She must have resisted.
We think we know who's responsible.
MALE VOICE:
We'll pick them up for questioning.
Vi. No!
WOMAN: No. No...
Oh, no.
Uh, Vi...?
Time to go. We've got to get back.
Oh, Vi.
Come on, now, trust me.
Have a date for the prom yet?
Mm-mm.
KIM: Hm, I happen to know
Jude's still available.
Now she is older and very sophisticated.
Come on, Kimbo.
I may be hard up...
KIM: Alex, she's cute.
Besides, she's very funny and very intelligent.
It'll give you somebody to do your equations with.
Oh, great. You know I'm in charge of the sound system tonight.
Not bad, but it isn't romance.
- Morning, Mr. Sykes.
- ALEX: He's wacko.
- Alex, no man is wacko.
- KIM: He really scares me.
He's always looking at women. I don't know.
Kelly says he spies on the girls in the locker room too.
No, Sykes is not a Peeping Tom.
He may have been here for just a short time but he's been checked out.
Hello?
- RASPY VOICE: Jude.
- Yes?
Can you come out to play tonight?
I'll see you at the prom.
MOM: Still no date?
- Getting closer though.
- MOM: A boy?
An obscene call and not very obscene at that.
Sorry, Mom, gotta run.
- Hey, beautiful, need a lift?
- No thanks.
- Come on, I won't bite.
- So who are you?
Seymour Crane. But, uh... they...
- (BANGS)
- ...they call me Slick.
(JUDE LAUGHING) I can see why.
- How old are you, Slick?
- Old enough.
Well, I've heard about guys like you running over girls on the sidewalk.
SLICK: For some girls, if they're... if they're good looking,
I give 'em a ride.
I'm going straight to Hamilton High.
Straight to Hamilton High.
GIRL: James' residence.
RASPY VOICE: Kelly.
It's been a long time.
Tonight... it's my turn.
Drew?
Drew, is that you?
- Kelly.
- (GASPS)
Where did you come from?
The back door was open.
I'm glad to see you too.
Oh, Drew, this horrible voice on the telephone.
- It sounded so...
- What did you get? A heavy breather?
It was worse than that.
He turned you on, didn't he?
Maybe I should try that.
I'm serious.
So am I.
Come on.
- Come on, Nicky.
- Yeah, Dad. I'm coming.
For a guy so fast on the disco floor, you are the slowest.
- (PHONE RINGING)
- It's okay, Dad, it's my phone.
- Why didn't you answer it?
- It's just Wendy.
She's mad. She wants me to take her to the prom tonight.
- (PHONE RINGING)
- I thought you two broke up.
You can't tell Wendy anything she doesn't want to hear.
Are you still going with the Hammond girl, the principal's daughter?
Kim.
God, I wish I had your women problems.
MAN'S VOICE: Dr. Fairchild, we only wanted him for routine questioning but he tried to outrun the detectives.
Why did they have to chase him?
The circumstances of the Hammond girl's death are unclear.
Murch lived near the place where she died and he's a known sex offender.
He was. Was, past tense.
It might have helped if your men had stopped harassing him.
Maybe, Dr. Fairchild.
But I believe he killed Robin Hammond.
You wanted to see me?
Thanks for coming over, Doc.
Been a long time.
I'm on a tight schedule. I hope this is an emergency, Sergeant.
Lieutenant. I was promoted last year.
Great, congratulations.
What's the problem?
Leonard Murch.
This came over the wire.
Last night, Murch escaped from the state hospital in Cleveland.
He took a nurse and her car with him.
The authorities in Cleveland say he's violent.
Whew...
I don't see how I can help.
I haven't even seen Leonard since he was institutionalized.
- But you know him.
- Knew him, knew him. Past tense.
- You think he'd head back here?
- I don't know.
Come on. Even a guess will help.
Lieutenant, you're asking me to comment on a catatonic schizophrenic who was disfigured and institutionalized six years ago.
I'm sorry, I...
Leonard Murch is an unknown quantity now.
McBride.
MAN: Lieutenant, Unit 3 has found that nurse.
- Are they sure?
- MAN: Yeah, the description fits.
- Where?
- MAN: Down at the old cottonwood.
Okay, I'll be right over.
He's back.
Nick?
RASPY VOICE: Wendy.
Do you still like to play games?
Oh, get lost, Lou.
Be home for dinner, Wendy?
How the hell should I know?
Save it.
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Jude.
- Missed you on the bus today.
- I didn't ride it.
- No kidding.
- I got a ride.
- Who with?
- KIM: None of your business.
- Who with?
- A guy.
A guy, huh? Who with, Jude?
- KIM: Who?
- I'm going to the prom.
What? What?
The prom!
Now I know why Kim won't go out with me.
She likes girls.
It's better than kissing an ashtray.
- Say goodbye, Lou.
- ALL: Goodbye, Lou.
Hey, listen, you guys ever get tired of each other,
I'm always around, lonely.
Oh really, give us a break.
Good girl, must be exhausting.
Why, look how he has to hold her up.
Go sit on it, ape.
Uh-oh.
- NICK: When? I never.
- Yes, you did.
Hi, Nick.
See you later, lover.
- I told her it was over.
- Worked real well.
Kim...?
- That's cruel.
- Oh, no, you don't.
Nick, she's smiling.
Got a big grin spread all over her face.
Race ya, honey blonde.
No! Women in love coming through.
- Where's the medical examiner?
- He's on his way.
I also called for the meat wagon.
Any sign of her car?
No, Murch must have driven it off after killing her.
I got an APB out on it.
Shouldn't be too hard to find a beat-up VW.
LIEUTENANT: Hey, don't touch that.
Might be the murder weapon.
Can I take a look at the girl?
Some butcher job, huh? (SIGHING)
Well, now we know he's back in town.
Next question is why?
Your guess is as good as mine, Lieutenant.
Revenge?
Against who?
You. The police.
- The whole town.
- Oh, great.
All we need is a full-scale panic on our hands.
Lieutenant, I think it would be wiser to keep quiet about this for now.
Come on, you mean not tell 'em that there's a homicidal fruitcake on the loose?
Now think about it.
Leonard can't move around freely, not the way he looks.
Yeah, you got a point.
And we don't even know if he's still in town.
I fail to see any good in needlessly terrifying the entire community.
Listen, the last thing
I want to do is...
Then keep it quiet.
If it is Leonard, we should be able to pick him up before nightfall.
I hope you're right.
- (CLICKS)
- (SLOW CLAPPING)
Bravo.
Practicing for tonight?
As a matter of fact, I was.
Practice makes perfect.
Kim is always so perfect.
Uh, Nick likes me that way.
WENDY: Really?
You are keeping in mind that after tonight is all over, everything's gonna be back to normal?
I mean, Nick is King of the Prom and you just happen to be Queen of the Prom.
But that's as far as it goes, Hammond.
KIM:
You really ought to tell him that.
I'm telling you, okay?
You seem a little anxious, Wendy.
By the way, who are you going with tonight?
It's not who you go with, honey.
It's who takes you home.
I'll try and remember.
You wait and see. Just wait and see.
I can't believe they got it ready on time.
Yeah, that disco floor looked fantastic.
- Know how much it cost?
- How much?
Don't ask.
Here's the incredible hunk himself.
Mm-hm, looks like a party.
Yeah, I don't think he's gonna be too good for my diet.
Mm-hm.
Thank you. What else?
- How about a muffin?
- No, cookie...
Like me better now?
KIM: It's an improvement.
Well, if you like it so much, why don't you taste?
- No...
- Come on, be nice.
No, let go!
(SCREAMING) Alex!
Alex!
Get off of him!
Get off!
Get off of him! Alex!
Alex!
No, no!
- (GROANS)
- Alex!
Alex?
Cool it. Cool it!
That's it, Perano, this time you're out.
Look, man, he started it.
Alex?
He was just trying to help me.
You better come along with us to your father's office.
Are you okay?
It just didn't work out, Wendy.
Why can't we just leave it at that?
Well, because I don't want to leave it at that.
I do.
Well, you blew it.
Lou?
I got this appointment.
I'll wait.
Vi, I have to go now.
Now, we will be there within the hour.
- Well, if you...
- (LINE CLICKS, HUMS)
Hello?
You again?
Brawling in the cafeteria, both of them.
All right, thank you.
I'll handle this.
HAMMOND: Explanations.
Look, I was just fooling around with this girl.
Kim.
And this... your son, he belted me.
Is that true, Alex?
- Huh, I knew it.
- You knew what?
- LOU: Well, it just figures.
- That I'd play favorites?
I'd take it easy on Alex because he's my son? Well, you're right.
You have been nothing but a disgrace to this school and this community.
You're suspended indefinitely.
Now get out.
I'll see you around.
Go and have the nurse take a look at you.
And come on back.
(THINKING) The same place he killed Robin Hammond.
Why back here?
What's he trying to prove?
Revenge.
Against who?
Psychotic... disfigured... violent.
He has to be hiding somewhere.
Waiting.
I've got to get that bastard before he butchers someone else.
NICK: You don't seem very excited.
KIM: I am. It's just... in some ways, it's such an awful day.
It's Robin's day.
My mom's all upset.
Dad is too. He's just too strong to show it.
You know, she would have been a junior this year?
Would have been her first prom.
But the Queen of the Prom must maintain her...
...whatever.
I love you.
You know that?
I love you too.
I want you to know,
Robin's death, I remember it.
I've always been really sorry about it.
I mean, I know what you're feeling.
I...
Listen, Kim...
- I, uh...
- (SCHOOL BELL RINGING)
I got to go.
Yeah.
See you later.
- It's a nice car.
- Gets me around.
Thank you.
- You ready to order?
- Yes. What would you like?
- Well, I'm a little short of cash.
- WENDY: You can owe me.
Yeah? Oh, well, I'll have a couple of burgers, large fries and, uh, what kind of beer you got?
Come on, man, this is a drive-in, not a bar.
All right, don't get nervous.
Just bring me a Coke and bring her the same.
No, a small diet cola, please.
That's it?
Yes, that's it.
Nice.
I'll buy you one for
Christmas, all right?
Lou...?
Lou!
How do I know you're serious about this?
What do you mean, serious?
Man, I hate that school, Hammond and his whole fucking family.
Okay, okay.
Listen, I don't want anyone hurt.
Not badly.
I'll take care of it.
Don't worry about it.
You'll be in the gym promptly at 3:15 for rehearsal, Kim?
All right, girls, let's try this again.
Mr. Sykes...?
This is just for you.
HENRI-ANNE: Vicki?
Vicki! Come here this instant.
- (JUDE LAUGHING)
- And you too, Jude.
KELLY: I'm not like the others, Kim.
Drew needs somebody like Vicki who'll give him what he wants.
Vicki's sex life is more talk than action.
Besides, Drew wants you.
I dunno. If I don't do it with him,
I know he'll find somebody who will.
- So? Let him.
- I'd die if he did.
- What about you and Nick?
- What about me and Nick?
What happened when he asked you?
Maybe I asked him. (GIGGLING)
Come on. Come on, Wendy.
I've got a thousand things to do.
So? You think I don't?
What's this? Is this supposed to be funny?
- I didn't do it.
- No.
You're all idiots.
- GIRL: I didn't.
- WENDY: Oh, shut up!
She's out of her mind.
I think I'll let Drew do it.
Let him? Oh, that'd be interesting.
Oh, you know what I mean.
KIM: Well, I can't believe it.
- (GIGGLING)
- (CRASHING)
Hello?
Who did it? Did you see?
Uh-uh.
Who was here?
I don't know.
Let's find out. Come on.
Come on.
- Who would do that?
- I don't know. Why?
- Kelly...?
- What?
Careful, Monty. A little higher.
- Sorry I'm late.
- Oh, I'm glad you could make it.
Yeah. If it isn't the literary
Miss Hammond.
Let's get started.
Alex!
All set, Miss Ransom.
Just updating all the tapes.
Oh, wonderful.
You can be Mr. Hammond for the rehearsal.
Nick and Kim, onstage.
George, could you close the curtains, please?
Now, you'll wait here.
Nick? Nick?
- (GASPING)
- Scary place.
Look, you are gonna be standing up here tonight and not me.
And if you don't know what to do, you'll look the fool.
Come on.
Over there.
HENRI-ANNE: Can you both hear me?
Yes.
- HENRI-ANNE: Can you hear me, Kim?
- Mm-hm.
HENRI-ANNE:
All right, Davy, start the tape.

Good. Now the king.

Shake hands.

- (FAINT GIGGLING)
Jude, look.
Why?
Yeah, we've done that, Lieutenant.
We got checkpoints at all the main roads and the other units are covering all the streets, plazas and garages around here.
If that blue VW is still in town, we'll find it.
One more thing, Sayer,
I want you to make sure to double check the whole... the whole area around the high school, okay?
- Will do, Lieutenant.
- See you later.
Hm, what am I wearing now?
Oh, tonight?
Yeah, well, you'll see soon enough.
- LOU: Yeah, I guess.
- Okay, now listen, is it all set?
It better. I don't want her ever to forget this night.
- LOU: Don't worry about it, Wendy.
- Okay.
Bye, bye.
- VIVIAN: Kim?
- Yeah?
Do you remember that dark red lipstick that you like?
- Did you take it?
- No. I haven't seen it.
Why does everything have to happen at the last minute?
Mom? Mom? You look terrific.
I remember putting it on the dressing table.
I saw it on the dressing table,
I know it was there.
I'm sure you did.
You look lovely, dear.
Thank you.
Well?
- Amazing.
- You like?
You look almost like a woman.
(LAUGHING) Oh, thank you.
You're welcome.
Are you gonna help me with these or are you gonna just stand there and leer?
You're my sister. I'll leer.
You're gonna get over here.
Thank you.
Oh, you've done this before, I see.
- Stop it.
- No.
Now.
Stop it! I smell like the ladies' room.
How would you know? Oh, of course, you know everything.
- He's here.
- Better hurry.
Would you get the door for me, sir?
- Yes, Milady.
- Oh, thank you, sir.
KIM: Good evening.
God, you're beautiful.
Thank you.
Thank you for the corsage.
It's perfect.
It's no match for you.
- Shall we go?
- Yeah.
Good Lord, what was that?
My date.
What the hell is this?
Where's your suit?
It's in the trunk.
Listen, don't worry about it.
Look, the guys needed a ride, okay?
Couldn't the guys have got a ride with someone else?
It's better like this.
Ah-hh.
- Come on, we're gonna party.
- No.
Look, this whole thing was your idea, right?
- Anyway, you look terrific.

I'm sorry we missed your grand entrance, Kim, but Vi's been very upset.

She's probably just nervous.
Yeah, I hope so.

Thanks for the dance.

No, still nothing, Lieutenant.
I'll check in later.
I thought she'd explode.
- It that dress, it wouldn't take much.
- KIM: She looks great.
Listen, if you need a ride home afterwards.
Thanks.
- Hi.
- How are you, okay?
It'll be okay as long as we stay on the dance floor.
- It's tough in the trenches.
- We'll be around if you need support.
Or an extra pair of hands.
Ready? We don't want to keep Preppie waiting.
He'll never miss me. He's seen Wendy.
It's really no big deal, Kelly.
It's like getting a shot.

I believe this is our dance, Monty?
We've had every man looking for some sign of him or that car all day.
Damn right I'm upset, and I need some results, and soon, okay?
JUDE: Oh, oh.

Oh, yeah? Well, why don't we take a walk along the bluffs?

This morning, I didn't even know you.
And I figured I was out of luck as far as going to the prom was concerned.
And now... (GIGGLING)
SLICK: Yeah, me too.
Funny how fast our life changes.
SLICK: Hand me the history book.

I had to tell you myself. We got him.
Where? When?
Well, actually the state patrol got him, out near Alderson.
That's over 50 miles from here.
Yeah, he must have left town after he killed that girl in the convent.
Well, I can start enjoying the prom.
See you in the morning, Sayer.
Good night, Lieutenant.
Hey, Drew. Have you seen my Dad?
- Kim, where's your father?

It's almost time for the Royal Procession.

Try to imagine:
Colonel Gray's secretary.
Unbelievable. A real Hoover.
She's wanted my ass for months.
Jody called in sick.
- You're on desk duty.
- My ass.
Stay on the radio.
The fog's a bitch tonight.
I saw some activity at Fort Point.
Patti Jean, give me a call if you get cold.
I got a jacket.
- It's not the same as a man.
- Neither are you.
Unit One Foxtrot is 10-8.
Unit One Foxtrot to Dispatch 297.
Scared away a couple of lovebirds.
Judging by the car, they could afford a motel room.
- 10-4. Stay on the handset.
- Yes, Daddy.
One Foxtrot to Dispatch 297.
Checking an open door at Officers' Club.
Wait for Unit Two Bravo to back you up.
Stay where you are, Patti Jean.
Bud's leaving right now.
Freeze!
Presidio, this is Unit One Bravo.
I've had an accident.
Suspect vehicle, light-coloured Lincoln heading southbound on Bernard from Presidio.
He ran me off the road!
Sonofabitch!
Shit! Hang on.
We've got him! He's heading for the Arguello Gate.
Stay on the base, Zeke.
Don't pursue off base.
SFPD will be notified.
They will respond.
Do you read me?
Zeke, answer me, damn it!
We'll cut him off!
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Hey, scuzzball.
What's this, plant food?
Come on, Ace. That's not my stuff.
- No?
- No.
I borrowed this vest from a friend, and it belongs to him.
That's what it is.
Is that right?
All units. Possible 459.
Lincoln eastbound on Lombard.
Come on, Schmitty. Let's move.
Hang in there, Leroy.
Save this for me till we get back.
- Gentlemen, this isn't legal.
- So sue us!
We are in pursuit southbound on Arguello from California, at speeds of over 70mph.
Roger, Edward Five. All units in the area, please respond.
Edward Five, eastbound California.
Roger, Edward Five.
Austin.
Yeah. Be right there.
Howard, I'll give you one more chance.
- Who were you with?
- I don't know shit.
You're too dumb to have done this by yourself.
Come in. When you were in the army, weren't you stationed at the Presidio?
Why?
You're going to handle a shooting.
Colonel Caldwell's in charge.
Yeah. I know him. I don't like him.
So? Don't take any shit.
This doesn't look good for you.
This'll be your third time down.
Third time. Ooh. That's the big one.
- Eat shit!
- You're wrong.
I'm gonna be eating in restaurants.
You'll be in the slam forever.
Shit is what you'll be eating.
It's their best entrée!
Howard is beginning to see the light.
- You'll be OK. I'll get help.
- My heart!
- Priest.
- What?
Right there!
You move, and I'll kill the cop!
Take your gun out.
Drop it and kick it to me.
Do it, or I'll fucking blow him away!
- Don't give him your gun.
- You want to die, cop?
Nope. Do you?
- Put the gun away.
- Give me the gun!
Think about it, pal.
You shoot me, he's going to shoot you.
No. Keep your eyes on me, or I'll kill you.
I'll do it!
Either way, you're dead.
- I'll shoot!
- You keep saying.
You're not gonna do it.
He's got his hand on his gun.
It's not quite working out right, huh?
Live or die. Your choice.
I need some help in here now!
OK, everybody. Let's go.
Move back. Let's go.
It doesn't concern you. Let's go.
The show's over. Come on. Back.
Zeke, how's it hanging?
Austin. What in the hell are you doing here?
- No shit?
- No shit.
You didn't steal that?
What happened, some officer shoot himself in the foot?
It's Patti Jean.
She never had a chance.
- I'm sorry, Jay.
- Is the old man inside?
If there's anything I can do...?
It's a kentia palm, sir.
I don't care what it's called.
When did you last water it?
Excuse me, Colonel, should I type up my report?
Who are you?
John Mueller.
I manage the Officers' Club.
You checked the inventory?
Yes, but there's nothing to steal, just supplies.
No? Somebody wanted something because they killed that girl.
- Yes, sir.
- Don't call me sir.
Anything missing?
No, sir... I mean, no. Nothing.
- The rear door's been jimmied.
- Yeah, I noticed that.
My people will handle this now.
- Don't you guys touch anything.
- Oh, really?
Listen to me.
We've got a multi-jurisdictional investigation involving the army and the San Francisco Police
Department. That's me.
CID still handles felonies, don't they?
So, unless I miss my guess, you're still the provost marshal.
Sir.
- Are you done?
- Maybe.
Listen, boy.
I was prepared to cut you some slack because of Patti Jean.
Well, your time's up, so listen real good.
This is my command here.
You watch your mouth when you're here.
Or I might cut off your balls and serve them for breakfast.
- Do you understand me?
- Oh, yes, sir.
Good.
Mueller, did you water this plant?
Say something.
- What?
- That's a start.
I'm lnspector Jay Austin,
San Francisco Police Department.
- Who are you?
- You didn't do that right.
You're supposed to show me your ID.
Close the door.
- What?
- Close the door.
Hello. Inspector Austin,
San Francisco Police Department.
I'm looking for Colonel Caldwell.
He lives here.
He works somewhere else.
I figured that.
You wanna wait on the porch, lnspector?
No, I wanna come in.
Donna Caldwell, the colonel's daughter.
You here about the MP killed last night?
The phone hasn't stopped ringing.
Such a small post. No excitement.
I know. I was an MP under your father's command.
- I never knew he had a daughter.
- Why did you leave the army?
- I had my reasons.
- Was my father one of them?
- Yeah.
- You're very pretty.
- Is it hard?
- Is what hard?
- Being a policeman.
- Oh, yeah.
Inspector Austin, are you flirting with me?
I thought it was the other way around.
Your father will tell you things about me.
- What things?
- Nothing good.
Are they true?
Find out for yourself.
Want to have dinner tonight?
- You don't waste time.
- How do I get hold of you?
I should have made decaf.
He'll be here any minute.
He's an intelligent guy.
He'll see us talking and figure out what's going on.
- What?
- You're attracted to me.
He'll be climbing the walls.
Later, when you're alone, he'll order you to stay away from me.
He won't. We have an agreement.
- He'll break it.
- No. We made it when I was seven.
- You were never seven. Free tonight?
- I'm a free woman.
My card. My home address is on it.
Here's my phone number.
Call me.
You remember Jay Austin?
Yeah. I remember.
He remembers you.
What are you doing in my house?
Ballistics matched the weapon used to kill the patrolman - the slugs match the ones in Patti Jean.
- So?
- They're from a Tokarev 33.
So it's Russian.
It's still a long way to come for coffee.
- What do you want?
- I thought you could help.
My instincts tell me it belongs to someone on the base.
Your instincts suck.
It could belong to a Russian.
They have a consulate, remember?
Or it could be a Vietnam veteran's war trophy.
I'll ask you once more.
What do you want?
I asked Sergeant Garfield at the pistol range if anyone owned a Tokarev on the base.
He said there might be.
When I asked for more information, he suddenly got amnesia and threw red tape in my face.
And you want me to talk to Garfield.
You said you only wanted to go through CID, and I was just a provost marshal.
Tell you what. Forget it.
Wait!
Let's go.
- Afternoon, sir.
- At ease, Sergeant.
This is lnspector Austin,
San Francisco police.
- I phoned about a Tokarev 33.
- Yeah.
- You got one stored here?
- Nope.
When we spoke, you mentioned you might have some information.
That's right, but you didn't ask about information.
You asked if the weapon was stored here.
This is fun.
Yeah, I'm having fun.
Are you having fun?
All right, what information do you have about a Tokarev 33?
I worked on one for an officer, as a favour.
It had a busted firing pin.
I made him a new one from tooled steel...
His name?
Godammit, forget him.
Face me. The name.
- Colonel Lawrence.
- Paul Lawrence?
You knew.
You goddamn knew.
That's all, Sergeant.
Did I say something I shouldn't?
- Let's talk to him.
- No way.
I'll get a warrant.
Just try to serve it on a federal reservation.
Since you got back here, you've pissed on me like I'm a tree.
You thought you didn't need me.
So, suddenly it's different... No.
If you want to talk to Colonel
Lawrence, you do it my way. OK?
What happened between you two was long ago.
You were wrong then, and you're wrong now.
And if you want to do anything with my help, you're going to do it the proper way.
- You coming?
- I'll walk.
..Air Force academy as a freshman and decided to become a civilian.
The bears on the one. Gilbert.
There's MacDougal, going in motion.
There's a hand-off, a dive, and he doesn't get in.
Who's winning?
The bad guys, probably.
You're going out dressed like that?
- Like what?
- You can see through that dress.
- Why bother wearing one?
- There's a thought.
Good night.
You're going to see Austin, aren't you?
That's not a good idea.
- He said you'd say that.
- Did he say why?
- That's between you two.
- Don't get in the middle.
- I don't tell you who to see.
- Of course you don't!
I don't think I'd choose Myra, the redhead who makes you breakfast on Thursday mornings.
That's different.
There are things you don't know.
- He was an MP, I was his CO.
- He said.
- He said a lot.
- Some.
Don't be fooled.
He doesn't respect women.
And you respect Myra enormously.
I certainly do!
He'll use you to get at me.
Gonna fight again?
Look. I care what happens to you.
I know that.
What is with you two anyway, huh?
It happened two years ago.
You were away at school.
- He and Patti were patrolling.
- The girl who was shot?
They pulled over Paul Lawrence, who was drunk, words were exchanged,
- and Austin blew up.
- Blew up?
He said Lawrence insulted the girl, so he beat him and put him in jail.
And you went down and took Lawrence home.
Even if Lawrence had insulted the girl, he can't justify beating him up.
- Depends on the insult.
- He was out of line for an MP.
You're defending someone you don't know!
- I'll find out about him.
- I don't want you seeing him.
- Is that an order?
- Yes, it is.
And what about our agreement?
Yeah. He told me you'd break that, too.
Don't wait up for me. I'll be late.
Shit on a stick.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Am I late?
- 10 minutes.
10 minutes isn't late.
In my house, they'd call out a search party.
You look great.
- People say I look like my father.
- Christ, what a thought!
- He knows where you are?
- Yeah.
I got a question,
I need a straight answer.
- It's all I got.
- Why'd you ask me to dinner?
Why do you think?
My father thinks you're using me.
- And you?
- I'm not sure.
Your father and I don't like each other. That's no secret.
There was an incident at the Presidio.
I busted a Colonel Lawrence, who was drunk. I threw him in the tank.
Did you beat him up first?
Yeah, I told you your father would tell you a lot of garbage.
You also told me to find out for myself.
He resisted arrest, then started on my partner, a woman.
Oh. Were you involved with your partner?
She was my partner.
Lawrence took a swing at me, missed.
I hit him - once.
- Were you out of line?
- No way. He deserved it.
And the sonofabitch demanded they courtmartial me.
So in walked your father.
What a sight - not a wrinkle on him.
He didn't want to know why.
He didn't care.
"Why?" isn't in his book, just "how much? When? What?"
There was an officer involved.
That's all that mattered, not my word.
I was just one of his men.
You want to know what the colonel did?
Backed Lawrence.
He walked. I lost a stripe.
That's it. So I got out.
I'm interested in you, not your father.
- Prove it.
- What?
The way I see it, we can do this two ways - we sit here and wonder about being alone together... or just cut to the chase.
- Pull across the street. Follow me.
- No. You follow me.
You don't know where you're going.
What are you doing?
Gave me your address, remember?
Oh, God.
Come on.
After school, I thought I'd move back home until I figured out what I'd do.
My father would be happy if I married an officer and had a million kids.
Would it make you happy?
How about your mom?
She and your father get divorced?
No.
My mother killed herself when I was two.
I'm sorry.
Where you going?
I've gotta get back.
- I want to see you again.
- I'll call you.
You take it easy.
I'll do the talking, OK?
Good morning, sir.
Colonel Lawrence is expecting you.
Thank you.
- Good to see you, Alan.
- Paul.
What's he doing here?
- What is this?
- It's official.
- Where's the gun, asshole?
- You really are smooth.
- Where's the Tokarev?
- Up yours!
The gun is part of a homicide investigation.
I don't have to answer his dipshit questions.
Listen to me, Paul.
He can get a federal judge.
- Let him.
- I don't want that.
I'll check the gun against those slugs.
When they don't match I'll return it, and this guy's gone forever.
- I don't have it.
- Where is it?
I lost it at poker two weeks ago.
- To who?
- None of your business.
- I'm making it my business.
- Get out of my office!
Come on. I said come on.
When you leave the Presidio you'll be on my turf, and I'll haul your ass.
I won't let you protect him again.
You understand what I'm saying?
I'm impressed. You handled that really professionally!
You keep covering for him, we'll have serious problems.
Even with a head as empty as yours, an occasional thought must creep in sometimes.
Like maybe we don't need the gun.
Maybe we already have a bullet.
Careful, don't try too much.
You might pull something.
- Afternoon, sir.
- At ease, Sergeant.
When you repaired Colonel Lawrence's
Tokarev, did you test it?
Yes, sir. I capped it several times, Colonel.
Any chance you'd have the slugs?
They should be in the bottom of that barrel.
It should be easy to spot.
A Tokarev's only a 7.62 millimetre.
Should stick out like a sore thumb against all these .45s and 9 millimetres.
Here's one here.
This came from
Colonel Lawrence's Tokarev.
Thank you, Sergeant.
If this matches the slug taken from my MP and your cop,
I want your word that you'll go through me.
- Sure.
- There's more.
If it doesn't match, get off
Lawrence's back and stay off it.
Take it or leave it.
Deal.
Guy named Peale called yesterday, reported his Lincoln stolen.
Tough guy to see. Heavy money.
- So?
- I won't ask you to come.
Probably wouldn't like it if you did.
But if you want to, it's OK.
You're all charm and grace, boy.
Pick me up at the museum.
More American soldiers died in the civil war than any other.
- How come?
- Both sides were American.
That's kind of lame.
This flag was at Fort Sumter when the war started.
- What's this?
- Never mind. Come back over here.
Get him to tell you what it is.
Don't listen.
He's mentally incompetent.
That's the medal of honour, our highest award.
Did you let that man in?
Look closely at that photograph.
That man is Lyndon Johnson.
He was President.
That soldier won that medal.
Doesn't this place have security?
- Just anyone can walk in here?
- Doesn't that soldier look familiar?
He wasn't nearly as ugly then.
Holy shit!
That relic there is Sergeant Major Maclure.
- Ask how he won the medal.
- How old are you?
- Eight.
- Wanna be nine?
It wasn't for charm.
He won it in Vietnam. In the jungle.
When he was separated from his unit, he found this wounded officer who was close to dying, so he picked him up.
As he carried him towards the American lines, he met an enemy group.
They were set up to ambush an American patrol, so he put down the officer, and with one M-16 and a few hand grenades, he attacked them.
He was one man against 50.
- He wiped them out.
And despite being wounded, he got the officer, and carried him to safety.
- What's that gun?
- A .45
The officer gave him it for saving his life.
- What's Vietnam?
- A place where we fought a war.
- I never heard of it.
- Well, it happened.
Did we kick ass?
I want you all to thank the Sergeant
Major for giving us this tour.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
You guys come back anytime, huh?
Did we kick ass?
- Thanks a lot.
- Don't mention it.
I should've left your Scotch ass there.
Scotch is a drink. A man born in Scotland is a Scotsman.
Next time you're dying in the boonies, call a cab.
Still worried about Donna?
We can't have a conversation without blowing our tops.
She's not a little girl any more.
Maybe you don't want her to grow up.
She's seeing Jay Austin.
Remember him?
The MP who threw Lawrence into the pokey?
I never did like Lawrence.
He's a monkey dick.
You're a big help.
Austin's a cop now.
That female MP that was killed?
She was with Austin when they busted Lawrence.
The thought of bringing down Lawrence is giving Austin a hard-on.
- Is Lawrence involved?
- I don't know.
The weapon was a Tokarev.
Lawrence says he lost his at poker.
Did he?
- Lawrence isn't talking.
- So maybe Austin's right.
- I don't want her seeing him.
- It ain't up to you.
She's only seeing him because I don't want her to.
- Say you like him. she might stop.
- He's wrong for her.
Would you listen if someone told you not to see somebody?
That's different.
Sure. Maybe you see a little of yourself in him.
What do you mean?
I remember seeing this 90-day wonder with an order manual in his pocket.
I said to myself, "The Army's finally found a way to screw me."
But you didn't turn out so bad.
It took a little time.
Maybe Austin needs a little time.
- Anybody home?
- Yeah. Over here.
- Hey, top. How you doing?
- Oh, still kicking.
- Still got a big mouth?
- I guess so.
Figures.
Just a little time.
Mr Peale will see you.
- This is lnspector Austin, Mr Peale.
- Jay Austin.
Colonel Caldwell,
Presidio Provost Marshal.
I'm Arthur Peale.
Can I get you guys something?
Beer, coffee?
- No, thanks.
- This is my assistant Mark Wallach.
- Pleasure.
- Coffee for me, Mark.
How can I help you?
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
I assume it's about my car.
Have you located it?
Your Lincoln was involved in a homicide Tuesday morning.
The one on the Chronicle's front page?
- Afraid so.
- Mark, did you hear that?
The Lincoln was involved in a shooting.
- You're kidding.
- When did you last use the car?
It's my wife's.
We went out to dinner.
I left it here and drove home.
Next morning, it was gone.
- What is Transcorp?
- We're a holding company.
Fairly diversified at the moment.
Jewellery stores, shopping centres, that sort of thing.
Which restaurant did you visit?
Jake's. Seafood place on Broadway.
- How far away?
- Thanks, Mr Peale.
Your car's being printed and processed.
You'll probably get it back inside 90 days.
Forget it, I just hope you find whoever shot those people.
Thank you.
Why were you in such a hurry?
Late for a hairdressing appointment?
You're the one who's real big on jurisdictions.
This is my jurisdiction.
I was conducting an investigation.
That was an investigation?!
"Sorry to trouble you,
"but your car was used in a homicide.
We're really sorry."
This may be hard for you to understand.
You're not in command.
You were in such a rush you didn't see what was on the table.
I put Peale through R&l, checked him up, down, sideways...
I don't like him, but he's clean.
OK. Where's the report on the Tokarev slug?
- Couple of hours.
- Good.
Come on. I'll buy you some coffee.
Are you kidding?
No. No, I'm not kidding.
I want to talk to you about Donna.
Are you going to ask me my intentions?
That's exactly what I'm going to do.
- You really are a piece of work.
- What's so funny?
How's it hanging, Major?
- Wanna leave?
- No. After my coffee.
- So...
- Come on, Major.
I'm talking to you.
- Let it alone, boy.
- Excuse me, Major?
- I said let it alone.
- Did I hear the Major right?
Did he give ME an order?
You stink, Major.
What is that smell anyway, mothballs?
What are you going to do now, Major?
Are you sure you want a fight?
I'll only use my thumb.
- Thumb?
- My right thumb.
Left one's too powerful for you.
Come on!
Guys....
Keep it fair.
- Get up, man!
- Come on!
I'll get him!
You see these little oak leaves?
They're silver.
That means I'm a lieutenant colonel.
If they were gold,
I'd be a major, understand?
- Yes, sir.
- That's good.
Next time you see an army officer, you'll recognise his rank, and he won't accidentally hurt you.
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
- About your daughter, sir,
I want you to know my intentions are strictly honourable.
I love this place.
Soldiers from all wars trade lies with each other.
Soldiers should rest together.
They earned their peace.
I got a spot picked out for myself.
They closed the cemetery in 1962, but I've got special permission.
I'm next to a corporal from the Spanish-American war.
Boy, are we gonna trade stories.
I'm going to say, "Listen, Corporal,
"stop telling me about those cannons.
"ln 'Nam, we had Claymores, AK-47s.
"Now, they were real weapons."
- Dad told you to talk to me.
- No. It was my idea.
You two been going
15 rounds every day?
Yeah. It's like talking to a brick wall.
He can be a stubborn son of a bitch.
You can't, right?!
- You like this kid Austin?
- Yeah, I do.
We've been seeing each other a lot.
Not just to piss your old man off?
Maybe in the beginning.
He wants me to marry Captain Gordon.
- That what you want?
- No!
- Let HIM marry Captain Gordon.
- That's what I told him.
This guy's different, though.
He's just...scares me.
- Why?
- I don't know.
He just...gets too close.
You're not afraid of HIM, you're afraid of YOU.
- I'm ugly, but I'm not stupid.
- I think you're gorgeous.
Afternoon, Colonel.
- You have the storeroom key?
- Yes, sir.
Yeah.
Is this about what I think, you sonofabitch?
That package you wanted located?
I found it. It's in Chinatown,
1412 Washington.
- Hurry. It won't be there long.
- Thanks.
- Surprise!
- You can't arrest me.
Wrong. You're in the real world.
You're not a colonel, asshole, and I own you.
- You can't do it.
- Guess what? I got a warrant.
I got a slug from your Tokarev, a ballistics match, saying it's the one that killed Patti Jean.
You know what I'd like?
I'd like you to resist arrest... just a little.
God, I'd really like that.
You have the right to remain silent...
Get out of here!
T.U.A., three five heavy,
descend to 3000 feet.
Minneapolis center, this is Trans-Universal
three five heavy, descending to 3000.
Roger,
T.U.A. three five heavy.
T.U.A. three five heavy, could you give me your location?
Ron, where the hell are we?
25 miles due south on approach, descending through 5000 feet.
Three five, what is your current heading?
What's his problem?
Minneapolis, we are currently heading zero-
T.U.A. three five, turn to heading-
Say again, Minneapolis.
Jesus, down.
Oh my God.
Down, go down.
My God, we hit 'em, we hit 'em!
Minneapolis, this is T.U.A. three five.
Declaring an emergency, we hit another aircraft.
Looked like a 10.
Three and four shutting down, cutting fuel to three.
We are going down, repeat, going down.
How much of the wing is gone?
Ron, get back there.
See how much we have left.
Right.
- There he is.
- Excuse me!
Mr. Smith, I'm Kevin Briley, from the Minneapolis office-
And you're not doing your job.
Round these people up and shove 'em in a room somewhere.
Make no statement
'till I get back.
Ashby, tell 'em what we need.
Right, c'mon, move it.
The rest of y'all, let's go.
- Move it!
- Back up, back up.
Come on, people, let's go now, do it!
Where'd the DC-10 go down?
10 miles to the south.
Jerry, Eli, go take a look.
Tom and I'll put down here.
Wanna give me a hand with this?
Bill.
Alright.
Bill.
Get the flashlight over here!
We were just going after the flight data recorder.
You wanna do that next?
Sure.
I think that the
DC-10 site came down a lot harder than this one.
What happened here?
Well, he managed to get it level, but you might have noticed there's only three engines.
One came down south of here.
So he lost a lot of wing?
We think so, yeah.
We started on the site map, and the cops have finally stopped moving things around.
Look, Bill, uh, we're being very careful but we don't think that this is a structural failure, natural.
Do you have any numbers yet?
Yeah, yeah, got 'em right here.
This one had 354 and 13 crew and the 10 had 265 and 11.
Watch that wing section there.
Do you already have the cockpit voice recorder?
Yeah, we have it, but it's pretty battered.
They're working on it now.
I want a dub made before you send it on to Washington.
Alright, I'll tell 'em, but it might not be too good.
It's a silly rule.
Why should the boys in
Washington hear it first?
I gotta hear what those poor bastards were up against after they hit the 10.
I'm sure they did their best.
They always do.
Are you one of Roger's team?
I'm Dr. Arnold Mayer.
I'm the investigator in charge, Bill Smith.
Bill Smith, yes, I know.
I've read many of your crash reports.
Naturally I've heard of you, Doctor.
What's your interest here?
You want me to leave?
No, it doesn't matter.
All this just seems pretty far removed from your physics lab.
Maybe scientists should leave the lab more often.
They might learn some things.
Dr. Mayer, what's an ecology professor doing at a crash site?
Do you know someone on the plane?
Not that I'm aware of.
How did you hear about the crash, sir?
I got a call from a television.
He's the last guy I'd expect to find out here.
Yeah, actually, he's not.
He's been to several midwest crashes.
That big one in '79 at O'Hare, he was all over that one.
I wonder why.
I don't think it will win him another Nobel prize.
Over here, I got it!
There's a whole mob here from Boeing, and the man from McDonnell
Douglas is on the way.
Wes Lake from the F.B.I is here, and the assistant D.A. from Ramsey County.
Okay, the usual gang.
Mr. Janz, I'm Bill
Smith of the NTSB.
Mr. Smith, my name is Raymond Leacock.
I represent Mr. Janz.
Is this a formal deposition?
Not yet.
I'm sitting in on this.
Bill, meet Ian Carpenter.
He's with the Air Traffic
Controllers Organization.
Mr. Janz, I know this is a hard time for you.
I want to hear what you saw, and what your actions were.
We were handling 40 flights, three of us, plus the private planes.
The screen was so crowded.
And a goddamned headache.
I was tired.
35 was coming in from the east.
No, from the west, and 880 was coming in.
Was that the 747, Don?
I looked away for a moment.
Some other situation.
And when I looked back, they'd changed places.
I told 35 to turn.
They were close, man.
And then the numbers switched.
You couldn't tell
'em apart anymore.
Somebody's got these guys working harder and faster than I've ever seen.
Well, that DC-10 was pretty public.
It spread itself over a field not half a mile from the Interstate.
Right.
And they don't want people gawking at their...
What was it they called that crash in Florida?
Involuntary conversion.
I think they made a profit on that when the insurance paid off.
Yeah, well, they sure are busting their asses on this one.
Look at that, they even got the ticket agents serving coffee.
Mr. Keane, where does this go?
What do you wanna do with this stuff?
Did I tell you you could touch that?
Excuse me.
Put that down!
Just put that down.
Hey.
How about some coffee?
Hey, wait a minute.
I think she likes you, Bill.
What'd I do?
Could it be your breath?
I thought you always got that reaction.
Gentlemen, they're ready to play the cockpit tapes.
Minneapolis, we are currently heading zero-
T.U.A. three five, turn to heading-
Say again, Minneapolis.
...Jesus, down.
Oh my God.
Down, go down.
My God, we hit 'em, we hit 'em!
Minneapolis, this is T.U.A. three five,
We hit another aircraft.
Looked like a 10.
Three and four shutting down,
cutting fuel to three.
We are going down, repeat, going down.
How much of the wing is gone?
Ron, get back there, see how much we have left.
Right.
Would you like some coffee, Mr. Smith?
Dammit, I'm listenin'-
Still going down.
Is there any place to land?
I'll check-
Can you rewind that a little?
Still going down.
Is there any place to land?
I'll check for a field.
Just look for a flat place, anything.
We'll be on the ground in-
They're dead, they're all dead.
What the hell's he talking about?
Sit down for
Christ's sake, Ron.
They're dead, all of 'em, they're burned up.
Jesus.
Yes, here it comes.
Was that Kennedy shouting?
Yeah, Rockwell couldn't understand him.
Run that last part through again.
I'll see if I can clean it up a bit for ya.
Just look for a flat place, anything.
We'll be on the ground in-
They're dead, they're all dead!
What the hell's he talking about?
Sit down for
Christ's sake, Ron.
They're dead, all of them, they're burned up.
Jesus.
Burned up?
They were going to be.
They might as well have been dead already.
Makes me sick.
Yeah, but it doesn't make sense.
You expect him to make sense at a time like that?
No, not like that.
Okay, I'll back the pilots.
Like they say, they're the first on the scene of the accident.
But how many crash tapes have you heard?
God, too many.
But how many times do you hear a man come apart like that?
Okay, but it's gotta happen sometime.
He goes back there and sees all those people who are gonna die and it's too much for him.
Obviously they hadn't burned up yet.
Well, what about, if, uh, maybe, maybe there was a fire in the cabin, maybe they were burned up already?
Sorry, but that won't work.
The fuselage was unaffected by fire until after impact.
He just broke under the strain.
Get me a transcript of that tape.
Roger, set up a press conference for tonight.
Let's go see what the dead have to say about it.
This gymnasium, is this the biggest place they could find?
Oh, Bill, I've got something interesting for you.
These are pretty good bodies in here.
Next door we got stuff from the DC-10, which is mostly pieces, can't be identified.
Next of kin are gonna have to look at personal effects, mostly, not many faces to show them.
Then the F.B.I. takes over.
We'll be lucky to tag 60% for fingerprints and dental charts.
Not enough hands, not enough heads.
We autopsied a few, and they died of trauma, dismemberment, burns, the usual.
We gotta get some reefer trucks in here, and some airtight coffins-
Yeah, they're on their way.
Look, I only got this place for two days.
I got a dance-
Trucks will be here.
Okay.
Now, here's what I wanted you to see.
Two kinds of watches, okay?
Mechanicals here, and digitals here.
Now, these digitals didn't do so good.
Mostly they're blank.
Heat must have wiped 'em out.
But we did find this.
Yeah, so what?
Well, so take a closer look.
It's going backwards.
This better not be a joke.
It's not.
Somebody had a gag watch.
Well, we thought of that.
Look at this.
Good evening.
You all have copies of the prepared statement.
I'm William Smith, investigator in charge.
I'll try to answer your questions, but I warn you, we don't know much more than is in that statement.
Who wants to go first?
Mr. Smith!
Sir, there have been rumors of some type of computer error being the cause of this crash.
Can you confirm this?
That's being looked at.
I can't say more at this time.
When can we talk to the controller who was handling the planes?
You'll have to take that up with the man's lawyer.
Mr. Smith, you're on record as issuing a pretty harsh indictment of the FAA for failing to require anti-collision devices on all commercial and private aircraft, even though, as you note, these devices have been available for over a decade.
Would you care to comment?
Dr. Mayer, do you have any idea what caused this crash?
One of Newton's Laws,
I suspect, the one about gravity.
Beyond that I don't know any more than you do.
Can I have an interview, Doctor?
Gentlemen, please,
I have to get in there and ask some questions of my own.
Would you care to reply to the charge made by Mr. Carpenter?
No reply at this time.
Next question.
Mr. Smith,
I'm Dr. Arnold Mayer, professor of physics at the university.
I remember you.
Thank you.
My question has nothing to do with overloaded computers or negligent air traffic controllers.
That should be refreshing.
I doubt it.
What unusual facts have you developed so far in your investigation?
I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Were there any unexplained observations?
Is there any indication that this crash was caused by something less obvious than a computer overload?
None at all, of course, every crash is unique.
Yet they share common factors.
There are things you expect to find and things you don't.
For instance, is there anything in the cockpit voice recording that's out of the ordinary?
I can't comment on that; it's confidential.
The relevant portions will be released in a couple of days.
You can listen for yourself.
Alright, but is there anything else odd?
Have you found any unusual item in the wreckage?
Any discrepancies in the time sequence of the crash?
I'm afraid I still don't know what you're driving at.
I can't be more plain without sounding like a fool.
I'm simply looking for the inexplicable; I usually find it.
Look, somebody made a mistake, and a lot of people died.
In a few days we should be able to tell you what went wrong.
There's no mystery about it.
Then I salute you.
I'll read your report with interest.
All T.U.A. personnel,
please check with your supervisor for shift changes.
So, is there anything else you need tonight?
I want the salvage team to work through the night.
You got it.
Better keep crew at the hangar, too.
Might as well start getting it all sorted out.
Alright, it's done.
Oh, my secretary managed to get you a room at the Marriott.
Tom, you're staying at the Holiday Inn.
Privilege of rank, I guess.
Why? They got a big beauty pageant there tonight.
Miss I-94.
You know,
I hear the bar's pretty wild.
Well, I'm outta here.
Thanks, Roger, your people did a great job.
Our usual service.
Alright, well,
I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah.
Los Angeles passenger
Mr. George Kelliman,
please pick up the white courtesy telephone.
Mr. George Kelliman to the white courtesy telephone, please..
I keep running into you.
If you're not running away.
I had to get out of that hangar.
I thought I was going to be sick.
I guess you get used to it after a while.
Excuse me.
Well, we could be stuck here for hours.
Maybe we'd better get acquainted.
I'm Louise Baltimore, and you're Bill Smith.
How long is it since you slept?
Do I look that bad?
I didn't say bad, just tired.
It's gotta be 30, 35 hours, but who needs sleep?
Listen, maybe we could go have coff-
Some dinner, and a few drinks, that'd be nifty.
Am I moving too fast for you?
I can move fast, too.
Let's go.
You should be careful, picking up strange women.
You never know where it might lead.
Taxi.
We could take my car.
What kind of car do you drive?
What kind?
That's mine.
You smoke too much.
I'll quit tomorrow.
Just like that, huh?
I've heard that story before, took me over a year to quit.
You don't believe me?
This is my last cigarette.
Was it that good?
You were the best thing in 1000 years, Bill.
I was, wasn't I?
I'm stunned.
Why?
It's been so long since I've... enjoyed myself... let alone been swept away.
Do you believe in fate?
I will if you will.
I think it was fate that brought us together.
You may be right.
I want to spend more time with you.
I'd like that.
We'll have all day tomorrow.
We'll have all tomorrow night, anyway.
This job is killing you, Bill.
You need to take a rest.
Take it with me.
The first rule is... never go to bed with anybody crazier than yourself.
I don't know if you're crazier, but you're right up there in the top ten of my weird list, lady.
If you knew me better...
I'd be number one.
Yes, I'd like to cancel the 6:30 wakeup.
Yes.
Damn it, they were supposed to call me.
Well, they can't start
'till you get there.
Bill, you remember we were talking about fate?
Sure, I remember.
Maybe that's why they didn't call you.
Are you listening to me?
I don't get it.
This job is wearing you down.
I know it is.
I can't just walk away from it, Louise.
Why not?
The world's not gonna come to an end if you just walk away.
I haven't had a vacation in six years, I got one coming.
In one week, I'll have this investigation started, and I can hand it over to someone else.
Then I'm gonna take a long look at my life.
Maybe we can go away somewhere together.
Anyway, we got tonight.
I may not be here tonight.
We'll talk about it tonight.
Louise?
Louise?
Now, as to systems surrounding engine number four, which was the one that sheared off in the collision, let's consider the fuel feed first.
You'll find that on page 19 of the computer printout.
Everybody got that?
On line five you will see there was a momentary surge when fuel line number four was severed along with
25 feet of wing tip.
They'll have a better figure on that by tomorrow, they tell me.
Smith.
Julie, thanks for calling back.
No, it has nothing to do with the investigation.
I can't understand it.
She was wearing a T.U. outfit.
That's right, Baltimore, like the city.
First name, Louise.
I guess I made a mistake, then.
Thanks, Julie.
...It looks like the captain had very little control.
Good night, fellas.
Good night.
We're locking up, Mr. Smith.
What's that?
There'll be a guard on that door over there.
Just knock on the glass when you want to go.
I'll do that.
Good night.
Hell of a mess, huh?
One hell of a mess.
Good night.
Smith, isn't it?
I'm not sure.
Looks like the pictures I saw.
Is he dead?
Stunned.
God dammit.
Where's the stunner?
There.
He must have been fooling with it.
Is he out?
Our luck, he's probably seeing and hearing everything.
If he is, it's already too late.
God, what else can go wrong?
Let's get the hell out.
Smith, you're gonna be all right.
You don't know me and I can't tell you who I am.
But you're endangering a project that's bigger than you can imagine.
Forget about this.
There's gonna be a paradox if you don't.
You...
You...
Coventry, send the gate.
My God, do you think...?
We didn't make those planes crash, I swear it.
Stand by for time travellers arriving
through gate Gantry D.
Operator, prepare for arrival.
We have major problems.
What happened?
We got the stunner.
Imagine my relief.
Louise,
I want an explanation.
Our master's voice.
There was a little problem.
Those words will be engraved in the annals of understatement.
Your mother was a cash register.
And she turned a tidy profit, too.
Louise, what happened?
All gate operators,
report to decontamination center on shutdown.
Do you see that?
Do you see the red blob on the timeline?
That is 1989.
That's where you just went.
And there's the mess you left behind you.
It's a goddamn paradox, Louise.
It's a potential paradox.
You sent me back to get the stunner we lost.
Well, here it is.
What you didn't mention was that Smith was there.
He'd already found it and stunned himself.
And I don't think he was out when we found him.
I think he saw us.
Sir, I have a timequake approaching.
Paradox, time quake approaching.
Four, three.
A paradox, Louise.
You've changed the past.
I know damn well we can't change the past.
It catches up with us.
We change.
Well, we haven't changed much.
We're all still dying, this place still stinks, and you are still as ugly as ever.
One not much bigger than that could destroy us completely.
Look, you're the one that's supposed to scan the past.
Why didn't you know Smith was gonna be in that hangar?
And you're supposed to be ready for the unexpected.
You're supposed to be the best.
You and your people get all the best food, all the best quarters, all our precious medicine.
Do you realize what it costs to pamper you?
He was there, he was in the dark.
What did you want me to do, kill him?
Oh, you'd like that.
Killing him would create the worst paradox imaginable.
His life affects thousands of other lives in an endless chain, and if you break it-
You get a thousand years of bad luck.
And none of us is here anymore.
Alright.
Let's go find out what happened.
Maybe we can still do something.
All I'm getting is temporal censorship from her jump.
Scan past it.
What does temporal censorship mean?
It means we can't see where we've been, or where we're going to.
We can only go back to a specific moment once, and never to that same moment again.
Too bad. If we could see where were gonna go-
You'll get used to it, Susan, after you've done a few more missions.
There he is, in the shadow.
Give us rapid scan until he moves.
Louise?
He knows my name.
You probably dropped your calling card.
Louise.
I didn't mention my name, neither did anyone else.
How does he know my name?
He's got the initiator.
Smith had met me before, hadn't he?
How else would he know your name?
I'd never been back to that era.
Do you want me to spell it out for you?
Give it a try, would ya?
In Smith's time he has met you before.
In your time you have met him only once, in the hangar, which means you will go back and meet him earlier.
I spoke to him, Sherman.
That was not a good idea.
I didn't like talking to him, Sherman.
I didn't like it at all.
You were not helping him.
What's that supposed to mean?
This seems to be my day for spelling out the obvious.
I suppose I should not complain.
Come on, you old fraud, prep me for the 1963 flight.
'63 mission will proceed to stage one.
The 63 mission will proceed to stage one.
You did not smoke enough, Louise.
Give it to me straight, doc, I can take it.
No new degeneration.
The levels of complex hydrocarbons in your blood are depressed, due to breathing the primordial atmosphere of the 20th century.
They think their air is awful, they ain't seen nothin' yet.
Maybe I should replace those kidneys.
Maybe a little kick, get the ol' blood moving?
Speed kills, my dear.
Uniform and hair for lookalikes
will proceed to stage two.
Uniforms and hair for lookalikes
will proceed to stage two.
Sometimes I think you want me to live forever.
Okay, so explain it to me.
It's what you were built for.
You don't expect me to know what's going on in my own head, do ya?
Hardly.
All right, on a normal mission, when you are taking people who are about to die off doomed airplanes you do not mind treating them roughly.
All done.
It's 'cause I'm helping them.
Obviously, without you, those people would be dead.
So you can function without remorse.
But with Smith it was different.
I don't think I want to hear any more.
How's the little feather head today?
Louise loves you,
Orville, yes, she does.
Polly want a chemical free sterilized cracker?
I should take you to 1963.
You could fly.
Would you like that?
Huh, would you like that?
You left Smith helpless and confused, so there was pain in you.
Alright, I felt sorry for the bastard.
But, I'd-a shot him if it'd straighten things out.
As Coventry said, you did not have that choice.
What choices do I have?
You say I have to go back, because he met me before.
Yes.
What if I don't go back?
What happens to the universe?
You must go back.
Where's my free will?
Did you lose it?
I will look around for it.
This is awful.
If you think that's bad, take a look at this.
We located the 1963 crash while you were away.
It is likely you will go tomorrow.
How are you on the idiom and history?
I know it like the back of my hand.
Who was the U.S. president?
Johnson.
No, wait, uh, he was assassinated by...
Vito Corleone?
Louise.
We've talked about quarks and antineutrinos, but what about people?
It's quite a step from demonstrating that subatomic particles can travel backward through time, to saying that people can.
What would be the result of people travelling in time?
For one thing, paradoxes become possible.
Say you build a time machine, go back, and murder your father when he was 10 years old.
That means you were never born, and if you weren't how did you build the time machine?
It's the possibility of paradoxes that make most people rule out time travel by human beings.
Still, why not?
If you were careful you could do it.
You would not go back to kill Adolf Hitler, much as you might like to.
Because it would change history.
The time traveler would have to be careful, but he could do a surprising number of things.
He could observe, for one.
Find out once and for all who was on the grassy knoll that day in Dallas.
And he will know what we can only guess at, that we are destroying the planet we live on by complacency.
He will have to live with our legacy of pollution and acid rain.
Our negligence today is producing a world in which our children's children will be barren, and the human race heading towards extinction.
He could also take things, providing they wouldn't be missed.
A cup of water from the Pacific Ocean, a stone from the Grand Canyon.
This may sound pointless... but sometimes very small differences can be crucial.
The difference between a dead man...
and a man who's alive can be very small.
What about a man who is about to die, a man no one will ever see alive again.
Stage three alert, all sections go.
This is the hard part about looking for time travelers.
They don't want to be found.
You must look for them in places where no one is, or where there are people no one will ever see alive again.
All personnel stand by for departure.
Go, go!
Gate attendants, pick up new arrivals,
pick up new arrivals.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
This is your captain speaking.
We are cruising at an altitude of 31,000 feet,
at a ground speed of 460 miles per hour.
If you look out the right side, through the clouds,
you can see the Finger Lakes.
Our expected time of arrival is on schedule at 4:30.
So sit back and relax, and enjoy the flight.
Alright, send the others.
Everything's nice and quiet.
Let's keep it that way.
Gantry operators prepare for arrival.
Extreme radiation danger.
May I get you a pillow, sir?
Sure.
Prepare holding pens for arriving passengers.
I'm through up here.
What's up?
Well, there's a guy acting funny.
He's watching us too close.
Get up, hey!
You're gonna take me to see the captain.
Sir, you can't shoot that.
If you depressurize the cabin you'll kill us all.
Nobody gets hurt if I see the captain.
You stinking son of a bitch.
Oof!
Hey, wake up, get in there and cork the crew.
You know the flight plan.
Keep it steady.
Alright, Squad Martin, fast and dirty.
This one's falling apart.
Did that man shoot her?
Don't worry, honey, it's gonna be alright.
When she fell-
I want you to sleep now.
Attention, attention,
initiation phase has commenced.
All recovery team personnel stand by.
63 flight in force field.
Holding, all systems engaged.
Ladies and gentlemen, please remain in your seats.
Ladies and gentlemen, please move toward the rear of the plane.
Excuse me, would you mind telling me what's going on?
Please step onto the raft,
Walk quickly to the bottom, and follow instructions.
You will be taken to a safety area.
Let's get you out of here.
You idiot, that's the survivor.
Buckle him in and come and help me with Susan.
Please step onto the ramp.
Walk quickly to the bottom, and follow instructions.
You will be taken to a safety area.
Please step onto the ramp.
Walk quickly to the bottom, and follow instructions.
You will be taken to a safety area.
Please step onto the ramp.
All substitute bodies will be placed
strictly according to the passenger list.
Passengers now in transit.
Prepare to activate holding pen force fields.
So now we know a hijacker caused this crash.
We know there was a survivor.
We know when it crashed.
We just have to duplicate it.
I stopped it.
I stopped the bullet.
You saved us all, kid.
Hang in there, you're gonna be all right.
He must have fired his gun in the cockpit.
Have Djakarta attach a 5K bomb to the wind screen.
That should duplicate the effect.
I lost it.
What, Susan? what did you lose?
Stun.
Stunner, I lost the stunner.
Look out!
Stop it!
Hold the gate!
Stop her.
Baltimore, get out of there, get out!
No time, Louise, no time!
Louise, there's a bomb.
One of my team was shot.
In the confusion, a stunner was lost.
It was too late to go back and get it.
You know the prevention of paradox is more important than individual lives.
Blame is secondary at this point.
The first stunner you lost in 1989 ended up briefly in the possession of Bill Smith.
He knows what it can do.
Then you went back to 1963 and lost another stunner.
The computers estimate it wound up in the possession of Arnold Mayer.
If he learns what it can do, he might be capable of learning how it works.
The council has decided to risk another mission to 1989.
You must meet Smith the day before you saw him in the hangar.
You must prevent him from going to that hangar the night he saw you there.
Since he knew your name when he saw you, he must have met you previously.
Therefore, you did go back.
Must go back.
Seems I can't get away from you.
I would be a poor personal robot if you could.
I lost a very good girl on that plane, Sherman.
And what was the council's epitaph for her?
"Preventing a paradox is more important
"than individual lives."
Susan knew that.
She accepted it.
I just...
I couldn't leave her.
It is not necessary to destroy your soul in this job, Louise.
But a certain amount of violence will be done to it.
You made the wrong choice.
It is easy for them to make cold choices, Louise.
They are hardly human anymore.
Am I so different?
We're all dying, they're just a little further along.
You are different.
You have feelings.
They want me to go back again.
You have to go back.
He must be kept out of that hangar.
This isn't a job for me, Sherman.
You want somebody bashed in the head, I'm your girl.
You will have to learn new methods.
You can do it.
I know you can.
Then let's go do it.
Somebody's got these guys working harder and faster than I've ever seen.
Well, that
DC-10 was pretty public.
Spread itself over a field not half a mile from the interstate.
Right.
They didn't want people gawking at their...
What was it they called that crash in Florida?
Involuntary conversion.
I think they made a profit on that when the insurance paid off.
Well, they sure are busting their asses on this one.
Take this coffee over there, would you?
Look at that, they even got the ticket agents serving coffee.
Put that down, just put that down!
What do I do with this stuff?
Did I tell you you could touch that?
Excuse me.
Hey, how about some coffee?
Hey, wait a minute.
Declaring an emergency;
we hit another aircraft.
Looked like a 10.
Three and four shutting down.
Cutting fuel to three.
We are going down, repeat, going down.
How much of the wing is gone?
Ron, get back there.
See how much we have left.
Right.
Would you like some coffee, Mr. Smith? after the senior prom in high school.
Still going down.
Is there any place to land?
I'll check.
Alright, Sherman, he's seen me again.
I think he's interested.
What next?
What now, Sherman?
Think of something.
Take him to dinner, someplace romantic.
How do I do that?
Pick him up, my dear.
How?
Drop your hankie, wiggle your behind.
You're the woman, Louise.
You figure it out.
Just be subtle.
Louise is about as subtle as a lead pipe.
Thanks.
These should be appropriate to the era,
as well as stimulating to the contemporary male.
Sorry about the high heels.
Standby passenger D. Lawrence,
report to Gate 17.
D. Lawrence to Gate 17.
Standby passenger D.
Lawrence, report to Gate 17.
D. Lawrence to Gate 17.
I keep running into you.
If you're not running away.
I had to get out of that hangar.
I thought I was going to be sick.
I guess you get used to it after a while.
Oh.
Excuse me.
Well, we could be stuck here for hours.
Maybe we'd better get acquainted.
Taxi.
We could take my car.
What kind of car do you drive?
What kind?
That's mine.
Why don't you get in?
You got the keys?
Keys?
Whoa!
Tower clear you for that takeoff?
So, do you know Minneapolis?
Nah, I've only been here-
Watch it!
...a couple of times.
Oh, I know a good place.
Any place is fine.
Something wrong?
Just watch it, Jesus!
You really drive this thing.
Are we almost there?
Another two minutes at this velocity.
How long have you had this car?
Oh, uh, forever.
You must be the luckiest woman in the world.
Hey, what are you doing?
Idiot!
You alright?
I feel like I should kiss the ground.
Wow, can't get that anymore.
I'll have another one.
Forget the water.
Can't get it anymore?
It's old, but it's not that old.
Oh, I mean I can't usually afford-
Are you ready to order now?
Bill, would you order for me?
I can never decide.
Okay, the sole, and tossed salad, and Italian dressing.
That's the first time I've ordered for a girl since... after the senior prom in high school.
Did I act improperly?
No.
No, it's just... haven't you ever heard of Women's Lib?
The suffragette movement,
19th Amendment,
Rosie the Riveter, bra burning,
Gloria Steinem, ERA, the battle of the sexes.
Who won?
I think it's still being fought.
We might call a truce for tonight.
I'd like that.
Who won?
You have a strange sense of humor.
Sometimes it's like you grew up in a foreign country.
I did.
I grew up abroad, overseas.
Whereabouts?
France.
I'm from France, my father was posted there.
He was a warrior.
Soldier?
That's right, a soldier.
Well, to France, then.
Excuse me, your table's ready for you now.
That's a real habit you got.
What habit is that?
I never seen anyone eat and smoke at the same time.
Where did it go?
If you hear someone scream, that's probably where it is.
Louise, you gotta quit.
The tobacco's ruining your brain.
So you never remarried, and don't have a girlfriend?
Isn't that a little unusual?
Is it?
I guess so.
I don't know, sometimes I wish I'd...
What?
Done things differently, I guess.
The job always came first.
I know what you mean.
That's how I feel about my job.
Really?
But yours doesn't take you away in the middle of the night, keep you gone for a couple of months?
By the time I got back, my girl had actually gone.
Well, maybe you didn't find the right girl.
Maybe.
Tom says I'm burning out.
Whatever.
I just gave up looking.
Took a lot of cold showers.
You find it difficult to talk about yourself.
That's all I've been doing.
But you're right, I can't.
Open up emotionally?
That's it.
I'm no good at...
Expressing yourself?
I couldn't-a said it better myself.
What about you?
Why aren't you married?
I can't have any children.
I'm sorry.
But that's not the only reason to get married.
It would be for me.
Bill, I'd like to get out of here.
Where are you staying?
I can drive you there.
For a minute, I forgot.
I haven't even seen the room yet.
I was going to ask you if it's nice.
Well, you could come up and take a look.
It is nice.
At least they delivered my luggage.
Compliments of the management.
That's real nice.
That is nice.
Would you like an apple?
What's so funny?
I don't know, you just seem to do everything a little different from everyone else.
Is that bad?
I don't think so.
Let's find out.
This may not have been such a good idea.
Why not?
You don't find me attractive?
Nah, it's not that, I just...
Wait, try it again.
Please, I really want this to work.
I really need this to work.
Let me get the light.
To hell with the light.
There's a spare toothbrush in there, if that's what you're looking for.
I thought you were sleeping.
I think I was.
Come here.
You smoke too much.
I'll quit tomorrow.
Just like that, huh?
I've heard that story before.
Took me over a year to quit.
You don't believe me?
This is my last cigarette.
Damn it, they were supposed to call me.
Well, they can't start
'till you get there.
Bill, you remember we were talking about fate?
Sure, I remember.
Maybe that's why they didn't call you.
Are you listening to me?
I don't get it.
This job is wearing you down.
I know it is.
I can't just walk away from it, Louise.
Why not?
The world's not gonna come to an end if you just walk away.
I haven't had a vacation in six years, I got one coming.
In one week I'll have this investigation started, and I can hand it over to someone else.
Then I'm gonna take a long look at my life.
Maybe we can go away somewhere together.
Anyway, we got tonight.
I may not be here tonight.
Stay with me.
I can't.
We'll talk about it tonight.
Sherman, send the gate.
Louise?
Gate's operation is terminated.
All controls to zero.
Hmm.
He'll never miss it.
What happened?
Did you stop him?
Sherman, get my uniform.
Paradox, time quake approaching, force seven.
I have to talk to the council.
We don't have much time.
Here's what happened after I left.
...going over every single piece of wreckage in this hangar.
Identify it, tag it.
If you don't know what something is, bring it to me.
What is it we're looking for?
I'll know it when I see it.
We're gonna reassemble the
747 from the ground up.
Bill, are you sure of this?
That's all.
Go to work.
He's forgotten all about what really caused the crash.
Now he's looking for the stunner.
And for me.
We're wasting time, Bill.
Can't learn anything from this.
Rebuild it.
Every inch of it.
Day and night,
I'll approve the overtime.
Bill, the boss is on the phone from Washington.
Tell him I'll call him back.
He says get yourself back there or you'll be fired.
Well, that sounds fairly urgent.
You want me to go with you?
I don't think you'd better be around me.
It might not be good for your career.
He's doing his job badly now.
It had to lead to conflict with his superiors.
Bill,
I've always backed you,
because you were a good investigator.
I let you run with this even if I couldn't see the reason,
but you've turned up nothing new.
Now, I have to know what you expect to find.
If I knew, I wouldn't have to look so hard for it.
This crash has been crazy from the start.
Like, the watches that ran backwards.
You said that wasn't important.
I didn't think so.
Now I do.
And the cockpit tape.
The engineer screaming that they're all dead and burned.
Was it computer error, or not?
Yeah.
As soon as we get your report saying that, we can recommend getting the new computers.
That's a big appropriation, and Congress is ready to spend the money.
Something happened in the hangar.
I found something.
I think it knocked me out.
Then they came and took it from me.
Now they're watching me.
I can feel it.
They can go anywhere.
Look anywhere.
There was this girl.
Now he'll go see Dr. Mayer.
Dr. Mayer doesn't have the answers.
But he has one of these.
It's the stunner
Susan lost in 1963.
Smith has the initiator.
You put them together, and it spells paradox.
Come in, Mr. Smith.
I've been expecting you.
That's it, it's all temporal censorship from there.
That means I will go back.
I can still stop the paradox if I leave right now.
The watches, the cockpit voice recording, that could be important.
It's hard to tell, but you say she didn't know you.
That's right, she said
I look like my pictures.
Then she hadn't met you yet.
I told you, we spent the night together.
It was unforgettable.
You're missing the point.
She finds you in the hangar on the night of the fifth.
She returns to wherever she comes from, then, for reasons of her own, she returns to the fourth and meets you... for the first time, from her point of view.
She's travelling in time.
There has to be another answer.
It's time I showed you something.
I've been working on a puzzle for 25 years.
You may be the missing piece.
That's it!
Where'd you get it?
What is it?
It's a weapon of some kind.
All systems green, quadrants interlocked.
All systems go.
Two minutes, Baltimore, solo,
1989, two minutes.
All I want to do is find her.
I don't care about anything else.
Bill, I think you'll see her again.
How do you know so much about her?
Because of this object.
It's very important.
I've run tests on it over the years.
I still don't know what it's made of, and we can't make one in the 20th century.
Where'd you get it?
It was in the wreckage of a 707 that crashed in upstate New York in 1963.
I was on that plane.
That can't be; the only survivor was a boy named-
William Collins.
My mother remarried and I took the name.
This is incredible.
Then you must...
What do you remember?
I don't think about it much.
You must remember something.
I don't remember the crash at all.
Before that, people were shouting.
Somebody got shot.
They found a gun with one shot fired.
It was a mental patient, a hijacker.
There was this lady.
It was her.
I remember now.
She told me everything would be all right.
She knew you'd survive.
But what about her, why didn't she die in the crash?
She got off some way, but she left this behind.
She'll be wanting it back.
After 25 years?
In our time, but in her time, she just lost it yesterday.
This is the key, Bill.
It's something that shouldn't be here.
We're living in her past.
If she changes her past, if she creates a paradox, then her world is destroyed.
Oh yes, we'll be seeing more of Louise Baltimore.
Laser beams, prepare for countdown.
Time tolls intermittent at six seconds, five, four, three...
I may not make it back.
You will be back.
...one.
All systems green.
30 seconds, Baltimore, solo,
1989, 30 seconds.
This came off mine.
You two know too much already, and I don't have much time, but I'll try to answer your questions.
Dr. Mayer, I'll have to take that.
You take people off planes just before they crash.
We replace what we take with dead bodies.
I'm glad you came back.
But the relatives identify them.
They identify the wrong people.
We duplicate them, fingerprints, dental records.
We're very good at what we do.
Then you are from the future.
About 1000 years.
It must be incredible.
It must be horrible.
It's awful.
We're all dying.
We can make the bodies, but we can't make the souls.
We can't have children anymore.
We steal people from the past to send them somewhere else to start over.
To give them a second chance.
I have to take that stunner back with me, Dr. Mayer.
It could cause a paradox.
I'm going with you.
You can't, Bill.
Haven't you heard anything I said?
You said you were dying.
So am I.
Bill, the whole race is dying, all of humanity.
We're all gonna die.
What matters is now.
This moment.
I can't take anything with me that will be missed.
No one's gonna miss me.
The stunner, Dr. Mayer, that's what I came for.
I knew I was right.
No!
He's dead.
The paradox has happened.
I gotta get outta here.
Take me with you.
Sherman, send the gate.
Watch that first step.
It's a killer.
Paradox, time quake, force infinity.
Paradox, time quake, force infinity.
Mr. Smith, I presume.
Come on.
Mayer's work would have changed the course of history.
He wasn't supposed to die for six years.
I tried to stop him.
I was too late.
It's all over.
The paradox is here.
If you had left things alone, none of this would have happened.
I did what I had to do.
Our world is at an end.
All evidence of our existence will be washed away.
We must attempt to send those We have saved
into a distant future that may lie beyond the gate.
Coventry, reverse the gate.
Get out.
Get out, everybody get out!
Go, Louise.
Get him out of here.
Open the holding pens.
Release everyone and send them to the gate.
You will awake now.
Remain calm
Remain calm.
- Come on!
- Come on, let's go.
Proceed to the gate as quickly as possible.
Proceed in single file to the main terminal.
Remain calm.
Do not be afraid.
Do not be afraid.
No harm will come to you.
Follow directions.
Walk towards the light,
and step into the light.
Move along.
Move along, everything's all right.
Please remain calm.
Single file, walk into the light.
You'll be all right.
Keep movin'.
Single file, walk into the light.
Walk towards the light,
and step into the light.
Our work is done.
I move we adjourn.
Seconded.
Just keep moving, walk through the light.
Walk into the light.
Time to go, Bill.
The gate will be destroyed in two minutes.
What happens when the gate's gone?
Like a nuclear bomb.
Step through, Bill.
Together.
None of us can go, only you.
Then I'm not goin', either.
Take a chance, Louise.
Go with him.
You are going to have his child.
The gate will be destroyed in one minute.
Sherman, come with us.
There is no place for me where you are going.
Go, now.
This is not the end.
This is not the beginning of the end.
It is the end of the beginning.
Hey, cowboys!
Want some sugar?
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year!
Should auld acquaintance be forgot...
No. I would never forget you.
I'll never forget you.
Bullshit.
After you, my dear Alphonse.
Thank you.
Oh, dear!
Call me if you get blue.
I am blue.
Call me.
The phone will be ringing by the time you get home.
Here I go.
Wait till she gets in, please.
Allison.
What?
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year, honey.
Bye.
Gracie Mansion, please.
Fish!
They've multiplied.
Lord Jeffrey Amherst was a soldier
Royal and true
And he summoned all the Indians
Into his sight
Oh, Amherst, dear
Oh, hello.
Ten-hut!
Line up!
Hello, Pepino.
Hello, little Lord Byron.
Come here and lay one on me.
Four, three, two, one!
Happy New Year!
Frank, wait a minute.
Forget it.
Just forget it.
That's easy to say.
You don't understand.
See, I don't care anymore.
I don't care what makes sense anymore.
I don't give a rusty fuck... if they boot me down the City Hall steps... and send me back to the Bronx!
We gotta get this guy!
Everything that can be done is being done.
My daughter was with her last night.
It was my daughter, my child.
It could have been her.
This is not politics anymore.
Everything's politics!
The hell it is!
I can't even sleep.
Bullshit!
When you point your finger at some guy... and you say this is the guy that could do the job... ain't the flashbulbs going?
Don't you read it in the papers the next day?
Get me your brother... and get him now... and get him before you go to the ballet, Frank.
Get those hoses up here!
Come on. Move your ass!
Move it!
Get it on, Tony!
OK, Tony, turn it up!
In the windows!
Put it in the windows!
Turn it on!
Get that pressure up!
Turn it on, damn it!
- Chief?
- Yeah?
I'm looking for one of your men.
Who are you?
Franklin Starkey.
I'm Chief Sunday.
Who you want?
- Nick Starkey.
- He's in there.
Well, get him out here.
I have to talk to him.
It remains to be seen whether or not he is coming out!
What the hell are those guys doing?
Tell them to get the hoses up!
That window!
Over there!
Get jumping now!
Come on! Move it!
Move it, damn it!
Stay with it.
Hey! Advance that line!
Hi, there.
I'll take it from here, Nick.
I wonder if I could get a cup of coffee.
Preferably espresso.
I'm not happy to see you, Frank.
You should be.
I've come to take you away from all this... and make you a big shot.
I never wanted to be a big shot, Frank.
That's your thing.
You must be up shit's creek to be here talking to me.
The mayor knows you're good at this kind of thing.
You must be out of your mind with amnesia... to be here talking to me.
Now calm down, Nick.
I'm a fireman!
We're going to reinstate you.
I'm a fireman now!
We're going to take all the heat we have to from the press.
I run into these fucking buildings when they're on fire!
You're gonna get a commendation for what you did tonight.
Please, don't bother on my account.
That was very heroic.
Go, Frank.
There's a lot between us.
None of it is good.
Please.
It's my career.
All right.
I'll come back.
Frank... on one condition.
What do you think of Maria?
- Who's Maria?
- The ballerina.
She doesn't trust her partner enough.
Should she?
I don't think she has any other choice.
Where's Frank?
I don't know.
He's late.
In that case, let me see you through intermission.
Mrs. Starkey, where's the commissioner tonight?
Here he is.
Excuse me.
Duty calls, and Christine goes.
I was beginning to think you wouldn't make it.
I had to go...
I had to talk to Nick.
He's going to be reinstated in the department...
He's going to be the new special investigator.
How is he...
Did he agree?
You look flushed.
The dance was very stirring.
Usually you're bored.
Did he agree?
I can't believe it.
Why not?
After all, he is my brother.
That never stood in your way.
Are you siding with him?
Franklin, you should know better than that.
What did you have to promise him?
Hi, Ramon.
I'm thinking.
I am thinking.
All right.
Hi, Ed.
Will you get that animal, please, and put it at her feet.
Don't smile, Olympia.
"Beware the jabberwock, my son!
"The jaws that bite, the claws that clutch!"
Watch your hands, buddy!
- Like that? Stay.
- Very good.
Shut up!
Ed, why didn't you use your apartment?
You've got the light.
Look, I'm making dinner tonight.
Can I borrow my table?
Sure.
Just languish there, darling.
Don't molest anything.
Ed... you want a job?
- What's a job?
- Work... for money.
- Money?
- Yeah. Do you remember money?
Yeah, I remember it.
What do you think?
It is irritating to me that I need money.
- I shouldn't need it.
- I don't agree.
It's good every once in a while... to get roped into somebody else's, you know...
What?
Problem.
For money?
Right.
I'm going to have a press conference... tomorrow morning at 10:00.
The governor, he's letting me have his best speechwriter.
He's gonna write the statement.
The fucking guy is a poet.
I'll have the hard-liners... wringing their handkerchiefs out before I'm through.
The prodigal son with the right stuff... forgive and forget.
"For everything there is a season."
How do we face the terrifying spectacle of Nick Starkey... what he may do, what he may not do.
Anyway, I wanna get going.
I want to start working on it tonight.
I want to get all the borough presidents.
I want them standing up there with me shoulder-to-shoulder... and if I can get that prick with the scarlet cape... the cardinal, to stand up,
I'm gonna get him up there, too.
And, you, you're going to be to my right.
Now, what I want to do...
I want it to look like the city is united... in bringing Nick Starkey back.
I don't want it to look like his brother's... bringing him clean underwear or something like that.
I'll take care of all the questions.
No matter how rough they get,
I'll be as pious as hell.
And when it's over... take a break, let them have a shot at you.
And then give them some hard talk back... two or three minutes, but be conservative.
Very, very conservative.
And if you blow, blow with dignity.
I'm going to be dog meat after this.
No, you're not.
If he comes out of this looking great...
I'm an asshole for firing him.
If he blows it, I'm a schmuck for bringing him back.
If he blows it, we're all unemployed.
And if he gets the guy, we're all heroes.
That's the news.
It's like
Elizabeth Taylor says...
"There is no deodorant like success."
What is it?
Captain Alcoa is here.
Shit.
He heard.
OK. Send him in.
I won't do it!
Do what?
Hey, don't bullshit me besides screwing me.
We're all having a bad day,
Alcoa.
Nobody needs your volume.
Nick Starkey is no policeman!
Well, his record shows otherwise.
He don't belong in the department.
That's for me to say!
He's like a... he's a fucking beatnik!
He's got a beatnik mentality.
Maybe that's what we need, is a beatnik.
Sure, seems funny down here and now... but it don't feel so fucking funny... in the middle of a murder case... when you've seen those girls dead!
Who do you think you're talking to?
Jesus Christ!
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
You think I'm your wife?
You wanna fuck me?
Don't mess with me.
You mess with me, and you better have a goddamn sense of humor... the size of Lake Michigan to find something to laugh about.
If I send you a rubber duck to work with... that is the news!
Can you understand that?
Do you understand?
So then, it's true.
It's true.
- When?
- Tomorrow.
So you get out of here, and you be a good boy.
And if Nick reports to you, you treat him like a god.
Do you understand that?
Can you understand that?
And if he wants anything, you give it to him.
If he wants your wallet, you give it to him.
And you keep me posted.
No. Never mind trying to say anything.
Just shut up and get out.
Go on! I'm trying to have a meeting here!
So... did Nick agree without a fuss?
No.
Well... what do you have to do?
I let him cook dinner for my wife tonight.
Come in. Door's open.
It's been open for two years.
Hi.
Hi.
What, is it snowing?
A little.
Well, take off your clothes... coat!
Make yourself comfortable.
I got to change.
How you doing, Sam?
- How are you?
- Good.
Shit.
What is it?
Why did you make me come here?
I wanted to make you dinner.
You always make me things that I hate.
I try to.
Listen.
What?
The wine.
It's breathing.
I decanted it an hour and a half ago.
How much did it cost?
I won't like it.
I never like any wine that costs less than $20.
No matter how good it tastes?
That's right.
I'll pour you a glass.
- What do you think?
- I hate it.
Here.
This is balsamic vinegar.
Sprinkle some on the octopus.
It's great.
Where did you get that scar?
A burn from a fire.
Right. You're a fireman.
Till yesterday.
It's hard to picture.
A burning building... everybody else runs out, you run in.
Basically, it's a maniac's job.
Marinated eggplant?
No, thanks.
Have you forgiven Franklin?
For what?
Did he do something wrong?
He betrayed you.
Did he?
He needed a fall guy, and he gave them you.
Did he?
Yes.
- His own brother.
- That's right.
How should I feel about that?
I guess you should be mad.
Then that's what I am.
I'm mad.
Anything else that I should be mad about?
- Yes.
- What?
- Me.
- Right.
I should be mad about you... and that is my fucking curse.
I am... still mad about you.
I should go.
Yeah. You should.
You hate the food, and you married the wrong man.
I'll get my coat.
You might as well, Christine...
'cause I am not gonna sleep with you... not while you're married.
I'm not gonna sleep with you.
That's right, you're not.
Not if you beg me on your knees.
I may covet my brother's wife, but I am not gonna boff her.
You have not changed.
Neither have you, but you should.
Chris.
Haven't you missed me?
Please, don't.
When you close your eyes, don't you see my face?
Nick, don't.
How do you make love to him after me?
How do you get wet?
Do you think about the money?
There was a check.
What?
That last night I saw you, two years ago. Here.
There was a canceled check on the table.
I don't know what you're talking about.
There was a canceled check on that table right there... made out to my brother Frank.
After you left, it was gone.
Are you accusing me?
I'm telling you.
You're wrong.
Maybe.
Thanks for stopping by.
All right. You've got about one more minute.
I can take one question.
One more, that's it.
Mr. Mayor, do you really think Nick Starkey... can expect the support and respect... of the police department... given his ungraceful departure of two years ago?
Now understand this.
There was no hard evidence of graft, all right?
What's going to happen to him?
Just a second.
Let me finish... or you can come up here and do it.
Now, because he was under a cloud... we were under a cloud.
So we made what you might call a political decision.
And he was wonderful.
He put the department's good ahead of his good.
He could have fought it, but he knew what he'd destroy.
And I respect him for that.
And at this moment, I think he's the obvious choice... in this dangerous juncture of time to lead the investigation.
Because we have to do something... and I think that Lieutenant Starkey... can make it happen.
That's all for today.
The show is over.
I gotta go.
Bye-bye.
Commissioner Starkey, how do you feel... about your brother being named special investigator?
I'm very glad my brother's been reinstated.
Obviously, I was grieved... by his difficulties of two years ago... and hoped the day might come when he could resume his career.
That day has come.
No one is happier than me.
Yeah, you look ecstatic.
That was police...
Cone.
Come in here.
Yes, sir?
When Lieutenant Starkey reports, keep him away from me.
Give him Olson's old office.
Lieutenant Starkey's already reported, sir.
He has?
Yes, sir... and he didn't like
Olson's old office... so he took the big one down at the end of the hall.
He doesn't like Olson's office?
He said the light was no good.
What light?
You know, sir. The sunlight.
Sunlight?
What's he need sunlight for?
For Ed.
For Ed?
Yes, sir.
Who's Ed?
The painter.
That office doesn't need to be painted.
He's not that kind of painter,
Captain.
He's... you know, he paints paintings.
He's an artist.
What's going on here?
Captain.
You told him?
Yeah.
You told him about the painter?
Yeah.
I got a sweet tooth for this shit.
I love it.
Captain.
Hi, Butch.
Captain Alcoa.
You want some espresso?
Do I hear crickets?
Yeah. It's a tape.
Isn't it great?
Who's that?
That's Ed.
The painter?
That's right.
You want sugar?
Why's the furniture in the hall?
I didn't want it.
I wanted space.
Did you miss me?
I don't have anyplace to put that furniture... if it's not in here.
I don't want it.
But I'll tell you what I do want... all reports, photos, news accounts... background of any kind on every one of the murders.
In order of priority... everything on that last murder first.
Second priority... everything on the very first murder.
You must have a shitload of stuff by now.
We do.
It's like a library.
It's in 202.
Then leave it in 202.
I'll go to it.
OK.
And put Ed on the payroll.
As what?
My assistant.
No. I'll assign you an assistant.
I need Ed.
OK.
And...
I need an NEC computer...
Lotus Agenda.
We have about five Bedbecks.
Bedbeck's no good.
I need the NEC.
I need the NEC.
You're not drinking your espresso, mon capitaine.
Oh, well.
I've got to go.
Where you going?
I'll be back about 3:00.
Where would I be going?
It's a beautiful day.
I put on my best dress and go to a funeral.
Hang in there, Ed.
Up yours, copper.
But we must meet calamity with introspection.
Allison Hawkins was a member of the Hawkins family.
She is gone, but the Hawkins family remains.
The family remains... and something of Allison remains in them... in each of them... and in all of them.
You are in shock now, and you are in pain.
When this coffin is shouldered and carried from this church... grieve your grief... let it go.
Trust in God.
Grieve, repair... live.
Open your hymnals, please.
- I'm sorry. Are you OK?
- I'm fine.
Sorry.
Do I know you?
No.
You're Nick Starkey.
I know your brother.
Good for you.
Were you following me?
Why?
You were the prettiest one at the funeral.
Can I buy you some hot chocolate?
Sure.
So... do you usually go from funerals to ice skating?
No.
It makes sense to me.
It does?
Yeah.
What's funny?
My father thinks you're a genius.
I am.
You know... let's forget this.
You don't want to question me?
No.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
In a hundred years, we'll all be dead.
So?
So...
My friend Allison and I spent New Year's Eve together.
I keep going over our conversation in my head.
We didn't really say anything to one another.
It was like most conversations,
I guess... except it happened to be her last.
And then today... that funeral...
I just kept thinking... how much of life is wasted.
I mean, we're sitting here, we're talking to each other.
I mean, shouldn't we be really talking to each other?
All right.
I saw my brother's wife
Christine last night... and she and I were an item at one time... and so it was a very painful evening.
And now today, I see you... and I find you very... attractive.
And I'm feeling vulnerable because of last night... and so my feeling is... my instinct as a man is...
I don't want to ask you a lot of pushy questions... because I want you to like me.
In fact, how real do you want this conversation to get?
Because saying these things out loud... has made me want to go to the next step... and say to you... this restaurant's a five-minute walk... from seven hotels.
It is?
It is... and I'd like to... get a room in one of them... right now and take you there.
You would?
Yeah, I would.
What do you say?
In a hundred years, we'll all be dead.
What do you say?
Just exactly how old are you?
God!
Is something missing?
Nothing's missing.
This is what happens.
What are you talking about?
I knew when I came back down into this world...
I'd start having weird behavior like this.
Like what?
23 years old.
So what?
And look... you're on top.
I've got to get out of here.
So go.
What if I had a heart attack, and they found me with you?
I'm speechless.
So... where we going now?
Where are we going?
How do you figure that?
Listen...
I haven't felt safe.
I feel safe right now.
Let me have a little more of that.
All right.
Show me where
Allison Hawkins lived.
Which window was hers?
You see that right there, next to the lights?
Come on. I wanna take a look.
Thanks.
Oh, Lord Jeffrey Amherst
Was a soldier
Royal and true
And he summoned all the Indians
Into his sight...
Come here and lay one on me.
Everybody knows where I live.
I kept having these nightmares last night.
I know my house is safe, supposedly... but it's giving me the creeps.
Everybody knows where I live.
I'm gonna have to get back to the precinct.
I got to work tonight.
I understand.
You can stay at my apartment if you want.
You'd be by yourself.
- Could I?
- Sure.
That would be great.
I'll... call my father and make an excuse.
Good.
Thanks.
Ed, why are you still here?
I'm just trying to get the hang of this.
Go home.
This is... Bernadette.
Bernadette, this is Ed.
He lives in my building.
She's gonna stay in my place tonight... so would you show her in?
Sure.
Hi, Ed.
Hi.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
So long.
So, go.
Ed, I'll see you in the morning.
OK.
Where you going?
For a walk.
Where?
Nowhere.
To get away from you.
What have you figured out about the case?
This guy, whoever he is, he's fabulous with locks.
In seven of these cases, the guy picked the lock.
Some of these locks were supposed to be unpickable.
What else?
He's not just smart with locks.
He's just smart, very bright in a useless kind of way... and cracked as an old teacup.
You don't get away pulling eleven separate murders... unless you've got a brain like a Swiss watch.
You don't murder eleven women... unless you're plain fucking crazy.
Or you haven't figured out the motive.
I haven't figured out the motive.
That's a separate problem.
I mean, I know the motive.
What is it?
This man has a lot of anger towards women.
That's fucking brilliant.
It must have been his mother.
Blue ribbon's an interesting touch.
I mean, blue ribbon... it's an award.
Maybe the mother... rewarded the kid with something that strangled him.
Maybe the constant rewarding by the mother... was the thing that caused the feeling of being strangled.
I bet this guy overachieves like gangbusters.
I'm walking here!
What are you? Crazy?
"Prime cut."
Prime!
What are you talking about?
I'm about to know when he's going to kill the next girl.
When?
I'll call you in an hour when I got it figured.
Listen, Frank.
You and me, we got something in common with the murderer.
We do? Maybe you do.
Just like him, we've got a mother.
Don't go comparing our mother to his.
Just like his mother, our mother had an affect on us.
Don't you say a goddamn word about our mother!
You see? She's dead, and we're still fighting over her.
She had a big effect.
Get back to talking about the case.
It's like with your wife.
Don't bring my wife into this!
I'm warning you.
You're right.
It's really about our mother.
Frank, I got one thing to say to you... and it's hard, but I gotta say it.
And if you can accept it... a lot of other shit's gonna fall into place.
Frank, Mom loved me more than you.
That's why I took the fall for you, Frank.
I wish you'd just fucking die.
Fuck!
Hello.
Hello.
Bernadette, isn't it?
Yes.
Mrs. Starkey.
I think we met at the mayor's birthday party... and at the opera, also,
I think.
And now here.
And now here.
- Would you like to come in?
- No.
He's not here.
Who?
Nick.
Right.
No, I think I'll just be going before there's a traffic jam.
Oh, my God.
Hiya, Cone.
You know what a prime number is?
Any number...
What is it?
Any number that can only be divided by one and itself.
Whatever you say.
There are twelve prime numbers possible out of 31 days.
These are the dates of the murders.
Eleven prime numbers.
What's the twelfth?
Five.
What's today?
January 4th.
Then it's tomorrow night.
He's going to kill the next girl tomorrow night.
Where?
I don't know.
I better leave you to figure.
You're the real thing.
You're a real shamus.
Alcoa, I know when the guy's gonna hit again.
You gotta give me your cooperation here.
Fuck you!
And don't even look at me.
I don't work for you.
You work for me.
You think you can come in my office... stand in my face and tell me the news... like I'm some monkey-do lieutenant?
Fuck you!
You are not a policeman!
I am a fucking policeman!
Get it, you dilettante fuck?
No matter what the mayor says!
I'm going to need a backup unit tomorrow night on call.
Maybe all night.
If I ever get my hands on a shred of paper... that proves that you were on the take back when...
I will delight in getting the charcoal for the barbecue.
I'm gonna need the team in the van... with the motor running.
Tomorrow's the night.
That's when he's gonna hit, maybe for the last time.
Where?
I don't know yet.
Yes, Captain Alcoa.
Get me Emergency Service unit.
So, Christine, I understand you had dinner with Nick.
Yes.
I want to know what happened.
Did he say he was going to do anything further... or talk to anybody further about the... scandal that happened about two years back?
I mean, not that there's anything to talk about.
He thinks there's a check.
A check?
A canceled check made out to you, Frank.
From who?
Well, it would be a crooked road, Eamon... but I think it would be traced back to you.
Does Nick have this check?
No. I don't even think he's looking for it.
You don't?
No, I don't think so.
I think he's much more interested right now... in fucking your daughter.
What are you talking about?
You don't understand what I'm saying?
I'm sorry.
Picture it. Just...
Look at your cigar and think of your daughter.
Don't bother to get up.
It's all right.
Roger will see me home.
What are you doing?
I'm checking into a hotel, Frank... and out of the whorehouse.
Lovely meal. Thank you.
- Thanks.
- Good night.
All done.
It's here.
What's here?
Tomorrow night is here.
February...
March...
April...
May...
June...
July...
August...
September...
October...
November...
December...
January.
These are the rooms where each murder was committed.
Where?
Have you got my paper?
No paper for 12-C, sir.
Let me take a look and see if my paper's there.
Holy Jesus!
Can you do a whole part of town this way?
Sure.
You want to see the big picture?
Oh, God.
Nick, can this voodoo and meet me out front.
There's been another murder, but we got the son of a bitch.
Tonight?
Hello, Captain.
Hello, sir.
The woman's upstairs, named Lana Pico.
Strangled in her own apartment.
He strangled her, walked to the dining room... jumped right through the fucking window.
Look at that.
The son of a bitch has the ribbon right in his hand.
It's gonna make a great picture for the Post.
How'd he get in?
Broke in through a window opposite the air shaft.
Broke in?
Yeah. The window was gated.
He kicked it in and waited for her in the bedroom.
Wait. Nobody gets through.
Can we just get down there?
Hello, Alcoa.
Hello, sir.
- And you are?
- Detective Reilly, sir.
Good to meet you, Reilly.
Killed himself?
Yes, sir.
- Hi, Nick.
- Not him.
Pretty ironic, huh?
What?
He killed himself.
We didn't need Sherlock Holmes after all.
Can we see you over here,
Commissioner?
That's my father's car.
All right. Go ahead.
Hi, Dad.
What the hell are you doing here?
And what are you doing...
Never mind. I heard.
I heard.
We'll talk about it later.
You just get out of here before they take your picture.
What's the matter with you?
Would you do what I say!
You get out of here.
Don't become a liability, little girl.
Apparently he just jumped, sir.
Oh, my God.
There he is.
The whole city is frightened to death for a year... because of just one guy.
Thank God that's over.
Maybe.
What do you mean, "maybe"?
I don't think this is the man.
What?
He strangled the woman.
He's got the ribbon in his hand.
What the hell are you talking about?
Why'd he kill himself?
How the fuck do I know?
He murders eleven women.
No problem.
He murders one more, he feels so bad... he jumps out the window?
I don't buy it.
Why'd he break in the window gate?
He never broke anything before.
He just picked the lock.
Then there's the date... not a prime number.
It doesn't figure.
Let me tell you something.
Life is like that sometimes.
You were wrong, that's all.
I'd like to take a look at the apartment.
You want to see the apartment, Commissioner?
I'll be up in a minute.
Eamon, could you take a look at this?
What is it?
A statement for the press.
You gonna make it?
- Yes.
- All right.
Mayor, what's the story?
- Did they get the strangler?
- Get back.
It's all over.
The commissioner will have a statement for you.
- Can we leave?
- Sure.
Excuse me.
The commissioner has a statement for you.
Mr. Commissioner! Rumor has it that this is the strangler!
Why was the mayor here tonight?
Tonight comes to an end twelve months of fear.
See you, Nick.
Thanks.
All right, I'm a fireman!
Jesus!
What are you doing here?
Ed let me in.
He was wrong to do that.
Nick, what's wrong?
I'm very tired!
Why don't you come here and sit down.
They want you, they need you.
The rest of the time...
Can I help you?
You!
You're the mayor's daughter!
I could do a number on him, but I wouldn't bother.
What are you talking about?
Don't you get it?
This wasn't it.
That wasn't him.
Then who was that?
Some guy.
Some other crazy!
And tomorrow night, while your father and my brother... and all the other slobs who only care about the way it looks... and don't give a shit about how it actually is... while they're all slapping themselves on the back... the January Man... is going to get his January Girl.
So stop him.
- I've been fired.
- So solve it anyway.
Nick, I woke up here today.
I saw how you live.
I see what you like around you.
I understand you want to run away from these people.
I understand.
- It's their responsibility.
- No.
They don't know what that means.
I'm tired.
I know.
I know you are.
So we're going to go to bed, OK?
And then we'll sleep.
And then tomorrow, after a good breakfast... you're going to catch the killer and save the girl.
How old did you say you were?
Shut up.
A hundred years, we'll all be dead.
But the stars will still be shining.
The stars.
Of course.
And all the constellations.
At this time of year...
Virgo has just become visible in the eastern sky...
I love this.
The recent appearance of Halley's Comet...
Time is running out, Nick.
Named after an English astronomer, Edmund Halley...
In order to be brilliant... you got to be in touch with the universe.
Halley's Comet swings across our skies... once every 75 or 76 years.
That wasn't the guy last night.
Yes, it was.
Don't you read the paper?
The commissioner called me himself... to say the case is closed.
He made it clear that I should give you abuse... shit work... so you'd resign.
I don't think he even wants you in the fire department.
Why are you telling me this?
Because I don't like you.
There's no place for you here.
But I respect you.
It's like the army... wartime hero, peacetime fuckup.
That's you.
Transfer back to the fire department.
I ain't got the stomach to be your brother's stooge.
I need a backup team, maybe a decoy.
I need your help for twelve more hours... then I'll go back to the farm.
I can't, even if I wanted to.
Don't give me that, skipper!
I can't get Emergency Service.
The commissioner says, from now on... all E.S. Orders go through him.
I ain't gonna put a decoy out on the street without backup.
All right.
You got what you got.
That's all the support you're going to get.
I'll look the other way till tomorrow... and then I'll expect a request for transfer.
And in the meantime, unless you see a man strangling a woman... don't call for backup... because it ain't gonna come.
Can you just lift your hair?
Sure.
How's that feel?
Ready?
Feel anything?
No.
I like attention as much as the next girl, but...
No. It's fine.
Actually, it digs in a little bit right here.
I'll put some tape over that.
All right.
There's a puzzle in the computer I got to sort out.
Let's get downtown.
All right.
Here we go.
Can you mark the 11 buildings where the murders took place?
Can you make the rest of the city disappear... and just leave the dots?
Virgo.
Stars.
Ed, there's a star missing.
Find it.
Get a star chart to scale.
Find it, superimpose it on the map.
Then we'll know the building.
Find it.
OK, now... we got one more problem.
Which window on which floor?
You got all that into the computer, right?
All right, Ed.
Yep.
I'll be right back with the stars.
Very good, Eddie.
OK, he likes to fill in squares.
Let's fill in the murder windows.
OK. Find the pattern.
OK. All on the same floor.
Down one here.
Back up to the original floor.
Let's make the distance between the dots uniform.
Good.
What do you suppose it forms?
It can't be another astrological sign... so what is it?
Now, what is that?
Music.
I feel like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.
It was a nifty theory.
There's seven notes in a row.
It goes...
What's that?
I just made it up.
Seven notes in a row...
No. Go back.
What is that?
That right there.
Yes.
That. What you just did.
I love, I love
My little calendar girl
I love, I love my lit-tle
Ca-len-dar
Girl
Yeah
16th floor.
We're lucky in that there's only two single women... living on the 16th floor with windows facing this way... and one of them is currently visiting Disneyworld.
You're getting to be a real cop, Ed.
Thank you.
This is it.
Keep going.
We'll set up in here.
All right.
One of us always watches the door.
We'll take thirty-minute shifts.
If it's the guy, we just take note, let him go in.
If it's the woman, you know what to do.
Bernadette, you take the first watch.
What's for dinner?
Nothing edible?
Prime number, Virgo, and "Calendar Girl"?
I can say it now.
I had my doubts.
Why don't we just take him now?
Right now, it's just breaking and entering.
We got to surprise him in flagrante... homicido.
Relax.
Listen, we're with the police department.
I am a police lieutenant.
Lieutenant Starkey. See?
There is a man... a killer, a strangler... waiting right inside your apartment door.
If you'd gone through that door, you'd be dead now.
Understand?
So we're going to send someone in in your place... and we're going to catch this man.
Do you understand?
Is that all right with you?
All right.
Thanks.
Oh, God.
All right.
- You ready, Bernadette?
- Yeah.
You scared?
It's going to be all right.
Now listen... you open the door, you close the door.
You start to take off your coat.
As soon as you feel that ribbon, you start screaming.
Be a piece of cake.
And what's the next part again?
I save you.
Don't forget that part.
If I close the door behind me, how are you getting in?
Sledgehammer.
I thought you were supposed to shoot the lock off with a gun.
I don't have a gun.
You don't?
Stop worrying.
Ed, I think it'd be best if you don't come in the apartment.
You got it.
I'm an artist.
I'll watch the woman.
Let's go.
Damn!
Jesus!
Hang on!
Come on!
I'm coming!
Damn!
Hang on!
Nick!
You son of a bitch!
Jesus!
Nick, come on!
God!
Bernadette!
Hurry!
Go ahead and do your worst, you dirty, murdering pig!
You all right?
I'm alive.
My name is Lieutenant
Nicholas Starkey.
You... are under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent...
You really want to play this out?
I had a hard time finding you, and I'm not about to let you go.
Call Alcoa!
You have the right to legal counsel.
You're... shit!
Give me the 2nd Precinct, please. It's an emergency.
What?
What?
Hello, Mrs. Starkey.
Hi. Lieutenant Starkey's not in his office.
I'd like to speak with him.
Do you know where he is?
I really don't know where...
Get the commissioner, three squad cars... tell them to get to this address.
And tell them to get the fuck there!
Nick's going at it with the strangler.
I thought the strangler was dead.
So did I!
And get me a car and get me the fuck there!
Get the fuck out of my way!
Sorry, ma'am.
You'll have to excuse us.
Of course.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi. Where's my door?
- It's on the floor.
Good. Grab the elevator.
How am I doing?
Listen.
Stop kicking me.
I hate that.
I told you to stop that.
You're not getting away.
Why don't you just fucking accept it?
I hate this job.
- See?
- I told you to stop.
But, no. All the force necessary, you know.
Do you hear them?
All right.
That's it.
You want to fight?
All right. Come on!
Deploy these fucking men properly!
What's going on?
Nick's in there with the strangler.
What about the guy we got?
It came over the radio on the way here.
They just made the guy we pegged for the strangler.
He got out of the loony bin about three days ago.
He's been in there two years.
Fuck!
OK, are we rolling?
Sorry, lady.
Police personnel only.
Do you know who I am?
Back!
Get down!
Come on.
I wonder if I could get a cup of coffee.
Preferably espresso.
- Does anybody know this guy?
- Who he is ain't important.
That's the problem with him.
He's nobody.
Get the photog out here!
Let's go! Come on!
What are you doing here?
I left Frank.
You'll never change.
Go away.
- You love me.
- No, Christine.
I loved an idea I had that looked like you.
Here's the check.
Darling... don't say I never gave you anything.
Good luck, Bernadette.
The world's either great or wretched, isn't it?
So many people are just finished.
You think?
I don't know, really.
All I know is I'm going home.
I quit.
The job?
Yes. I'm going home,
I'm going to mix some paint... and I'm gonna try and do something original.
See you.
Listen...
I want to make you dinner.
You know... in a couple of days.
That'd be nice.
I want to make you haggis.
What's haggis?
It's a Scottish dish.
You take the stomach of a sheep, and then you stuff it... with the sheep's lungs, liver, and heart... some onions, suet, and oatmeal.
And then you boil the whole thing.
I don't know.
Sounds a little weird... but I'm game to try it.
At last the glittering...
Queen of Night...
with black caress...
kills off...
kills off the day.
Mr. Chandos was a man who spent more time... with his gardener than with his wife.
They discussed plum trees... ad nauseam.
He gave his family and his tenants cause to dread September... for they were regaled with plums until their guts rumbled like... thunder and their backsides ached from over-use.
He built the chapel at Fovant... where the pew seats were of plumwood... so the tenants still have cause to remember Chandos... through their backsides... on account of the splinters.
At last the glittering...
Queen of Night...
with black caress...
kills off...
kills off the day.
Some years ago two gentlemen went back to Amsterdam... saying that Allhevinghay was just like home.
There was so much water... so many ornamental ponds, so many canals... so many sinks and basins.
There was even a wind pump.
What they had not reamed was... my father had made his land into a pattern... of reservoirs... because he was terrified of fire.
There was even a room under the front stairs... that housed two hundred buckets... all of them filled with water.
I know because whenever I was taken short... my brothers and I used to rush in there and use them.
Those buckets were filled before my mother died.
I expect them to be still there... with the same water of thirty years ago I shouldn't wonder... mixed with a little of myself, of course.
I used to pee like a horse.
I still do.
For those that walk...
that walk...
with hopeful step...
in garden...
in garden...
love to find.
At Southampton there's a house I've admired... because from the side it looks so flat.
It is of white Portland stone... and on a cloudy day it looks as though... it might be attached to the sky.
Especially in the evening.
Its owner is a Miss Anterim.
She is a lady without a husband.
From the side Miss Anterim is also... a lady without significance.
Maybe that is why unlike her house... the lady is unattached.
What with one flatness and another, Mr. Neville... as a painter and as a draughtsman... you could be entertained.
Especially in the evening... from the side.
For those that walk...
that walk.
It is said that the Duc de
Courey invited his water mechanic... to the top of an elaborate cascade he had built... and asked him if he could build such a marvel for anyone else.
The man, after offering various thanks and pleasantries... admitted that with sufficient patronage he probably could.
The Duc de Courey pushed him gently in the small of the back... and the wretched man plummeted to a watery death.
Their hope to find success.
They're sure to make.
Mr. Noyes... do you have a ribald piece of gossip for me?
I am here to fulfill a role as entertainer, so I am sure... that I could find something for you.
Then you are here on merit.
A characteristic that the company does not share... being here merely to express confidence in one another's money.
You are one of the company.
My merititious conduct in the company of Mr. Seymour... has been my invitation.
I am strictly not of the company... but a part of its property.
Since that's what the company is here to discuss and to revel in... you should be well favored.
I would well favor you myself above two parterres and... drive of orange trees.
You are not extravagant in your compliments, Mr. Noyes.
I'm not wealthy enough to offer you more... but I intend to be so soon.
In the present company of 13... that owns a fair slice of England.
Two parterres and a drive of orange trees is a beginning... and being a lady of the Italian fashion.
You will appreciate the value of oranges.
They smell so sweet.
They are so invigorating.
The very statues...
breathe.
Do you think your father will ask Mr.
Neville to draw the house?
Why not improve Mr. Neville's chances, and yours, by inviting him yourself?
That is a too imaginative stratagem for me.
Your father would find it uncharacteristically bold.
Then you could surprise him... and perhaps surprise
Mr. Neville, as well.
And if that frightens you, mother... we could lay the blame on Mr. Neville.
I hold the delight or despondency of a man of property... by putting his house in shadow or in sunlight.
Even possibly...
I have some control over the jealousy... or satisfaction of a husband... by depicting his wife... dressed or undressed.
Mrs. Clement asked me if I had a wife... which has a ring of impertinence.
She knows I have a garden, how doesn't she know I have a wife?
Perhaps because you boast of one and not the other.
But I suspect a sense of modesty is an impertinence... to such a lady as Mrs. Clement.
Your mother takes a sense of modesty an unprecedented distance.
Why doesn't she come out more?
She frets in the shadows.
She does not fret, father... or if she does you well know the cause is your indifference.
A house, a garden, a horse, a wife, the preferential order.
Nonsense!
I am anxious, Mr. Neville... that you should draw my husband's estate.
Why is that Madam?
My husband is a proud man delighted to be associated with every brick... and every tree of his property at every moment of his waking life.
No doubt in his dreams as well... though I've not been well acquainted with his dreams.
With such an excellent relationship as... your husband has with his property... he surely, having the real thing, does not need a copy.
I do not take well to young men who preen.
Their vanity outweighs their prowess.
Mr. Neville has prowess enough.
Enough to charm where he cannot impress.
He can charm and impress the wives of rich men.
That's not so uncommon, Mr. Seymour.
You come with me to
Southampton tomorrow.
I'll show you how to impress a lady with a good drawing on.
My father's property, Mr. Neville... is a little more forward than humble.
Since humility in a building is not antithetical to you... perhaps I can prevail on you to draw my father's house?
The same proposition from a different quarter.
A concerted effort naturally intrigues me... but I feel things being as they are.
May I be bold.
I do not think that you or your mother... could afford my services.
Why not enjoy our patronage?
Come and walk in Mr.
Herbert's garden tomorrow.
Madam...
I cannot say that I wouldn't be delighted... but I fear, despite your persistence... that I have work to do up and beyond... this apple season and will be in the service... of Lord Charborough until next year's apples... have all been drunk as cider.
Your mother is excessively keen... to have this house down on paper.
Or perhaps it is you that is keen... and your mother is merely your surrogate?
I admit, Mr. Neville, to being a supplicant on my mother's behalf... but she does not want it for herself but for her husband.
The supplication then has a long and diverse path.
I am flattered.
May not Mr. Herbert himself do his own commissioning?
The point of the exercise... is to avoid that one thing.
You, Mr. Neville, are to be... the instrument of a hopeful reconciliation.
Mr. Neville... how can I persuade you to stay with us at Compton Anstey?
You cannot.
But you can be bought, Mr. Neville.
How much will it cost?
More than you can afford.
But I must confess my prime reason is indolence.
I increase my price... in proportion to my expectation of pleasure.
I do not expect great pleasure here.
Madam...
I'm to leave in the morning for Southampton.
I've come to take my leave of you now.
Do not order the hay to be cut.
Do not leave the estate and do not drink my claret.
Don't expect me back until I'm ready, which at the least will be 14 days.
Good night, Madam.
She laughs...
I have decided... that it is most important that you stay here... to make for me twelve drawings of my husband's estate.
My husband is to go to Southampton... for at least twelve days.
Will that be enough time for you?
First you make a demand that suggests... we haven't discussed the proposition this evening.
Second, you increase your demand by at least 12.
Third, you add to the proposition a time limit.
And fourth, you expect me to start at once.
Four factors, you have convinced us... are well within your talents and capabilities.
Your terms are exorbitant... so must mine be.
She loves...
and she confesses to.
There is then at last...
no more to do.
The conditions of the agreement are:
My services as draughtsman for twelve days... for the manufacture of 12 drawings... of the estate and gardens... parks and outlying buildings of Mr. Herbert's Property.
The sites for the twelve drawings to be chosen at my discretion... though advised by Mrs. Herbert.
For which, Thomas, I am willing to pay eight pounds a drawing... to provide full board for
Mr. Neville and his servant... and...
And, Madam?
And to meet Mr. Neville in private... and to comply with his requests concerning his pleasure with me.
Curriculum for the Execution...
of the Drawings at
Compton Anstey.
For Drawing Number 1.
From 7 in the morning...
until 9 in the morning...
the whole of the back of the house...
from the stable block to the laundry garden...
will be kept clear.
No person shall use the main stable yard gates whatsoever...
and no person shall use the back door...
or interfere with the windows or furniture...
of the back part of the house.
'A 'is for Apricot.
'M' is for Marilla.
'C' is for Citrona.
Citrona.
'A' is for Ananas.
Ananas.
'P' is for Pineapple.
For Drawing Number 2.
From 9 o'clock in the morning until 11 o'clock...
the lower lawns of the house...
including the formal garden will be kept clear.
No window in the upper part of the house will be opened...
closed or otherwise disturbed.
Your Mr. Neville, Sarah... has the God-like power of emptying the landscape.
It is a wonder the birds still sing.
If they stopped...
I doubt whether Mr. Neville would appreciate the difference.
His attitude to nature is strictly material.
Thomas... why is Mr. Neville interested in my sheets?
He is to draw them wet outside the laundry.
Wet?
Why does he want them wet?
I cannot answer you that.
Perhaps he has fond memories of being a baby.
For Drawing Number 3.
From 11 o'clock in the morning until 1 o'clock...
the back and north side of the house...
will be kept clear.
This area...
used as a place for drying linen...
will be left as asked for, on an arrangement...
made between the draughtsman and the laundress...
who will take full responsibility...
for the disposition of the linen.
I am delighted to see that... you've loosened your clothing as I requested.
When your husband had the pear trees grafted... do you know if he asked for the advice... of Mr. Seymour's gardener?
We...
You do not speak very loud.
We...
We do not know
Mr. Seymour's gardener.
I see.
Mr. Neville.
The trees have been poorly cared for.
The angle between the branches... and the main trunk is too steep.
But the original work is good.
And what of the pears themselves... in season.
Are they presentable?
For Drawing Number 4.
From 2 o'clock until 4 o'clock in the afternoon...
the front of the house that faces west will be kept clear.
No horses, carriages or other vehicles...
will be allowed to be placed there...
and the gravel on the drive will be left undisturbed.
No coals are to be burned that will issue smoke...
from the front of the house.
And Hurry up!
For Drawing Number 5.
From 4 o'clock in the afternoon until 6 o'clock in the afternoon...
the hilltop prospect of the estate to the north of the house...
will be kept clear of all members...
of the household staff and farm servants.
Such animals as are presently grazing in the fields...
will be permitted to continue to do so.
Good day, Mr. Neville.
Mr. Talmann.
I see you have selected a fine view... for my son to inherit.
I prefer, for the moment... to regard the view as the property of Mr. Herbert.
Thomas... see that Clarissa doesn't go to the laundry around noon.
And, come to my withdrawing room...
this afternoon with some ink.
I want to send to
Mr. Herbert to know...
by which road he intends to return.
Is it your intention to continue to stand there Mr. Talmann?
I can see the view very adequately from here.
Thank you.
Will you be wearing the same clothes tomorrow?
Why?
I have not decided.
It depends on my servants.
Is it important?
Maybe I will.
For Drawing Number 6.
From 6 o'clock in the evening until 8 o'clock...
the lower lawn of the garden by the statue of Hermes...
will be kept clear of all members of the house hold...
staff, horses and other animals.
Philip, go and ask those people to move.
Ask them nicely, smile.
Don't trot.
Go away.
Where?
Really?
Not that I know.
Mr. Lucas... was a man whose enthusiasms were divided equally... between his garden and his children.
Whenever his wife conceived...
Mr. Lucas planted fruit-trees.
His wife seldom came to a successful labor... and those children she was blessed with died before weaning.
Mr. Lucas threatened to cut his trees down, but he never did.
To date there are 11 trees in his fruit-garden... and he knows them all by their Christian names.
The English are not blessed with the most appropriate fecundity.
They can raise colonies but not heirs to the throne.
It depends which colonies you are speaking of.
Some of England's oldest colonies have heirs in plenty.
Mr. Neville... do we have an indication of Scottish sympathies?
You would be reading far too much... into what is simply a statement of fact.
If the best Englishmen are foreigners... and that seems to be a simple statement of fact... then the best English painters are foreigners too.
There's no English painter worthy of the name.
Would you agree Mr. Neville?
To be an English painter... is a contradictory term.
Then Mr. Herbert shows some sense in encouraging Mr. Neville.
Mr. Herbert, as we all know... is full of contradictions.
Contradictory enough to have invited you into this house.
Despite his being a man without airs and graces.
But not privy to whom his wife... welcomes into his house.
When my father is away, Louis... my mother is at liberty to run his house as she feels fit.
And she has seen fit to invite Mr. Neville.
A gracious speech, Mrs. Talmann.
To hide all manner of inconveniences.
How is that?
It is apparent.
It isn't from our meeting that your presumptory regime... not only extends to confining the household... like animals in reservations... but directing us as to whether or not we should wear a coat... carry a walking-stick or whistle.
When I met you in the garden... you were doing all those things.
If you intend being there tomorrow...
I would wish you to dress and to behave in the same way.
However, it's beyond my power... to describe a whistle pictorially, whether it comes... from an Englishman or from a German dressed as an Englishman.
And what do you do about the birds, Mr. Neville?
If you ignore their song, you can't prevent them from flying across... the field of your vision.
The prospect of twelve fine-weather days... with clear skies... and sharp shadows is an excellent proposition... but not to be guaranteed.
So I am naturally anxious... that time should not be wasted.
It would assist me greatly therefore... if my instructions, which have been given great consideration... should be observed.
I'm painstaking enough... to notice quite small changes in the landscape.
Once started,
I make that a committal... whatsoever ensues.
And I think you can surmise... that it's an attitude from which
I obtain great satisfaction... and some entertainment.
Thomas... can you remember, when
Mr. Herbert had his clothes packed... whether he took his French boots?
How is it that you've contrived... to make the garden so empty of people?
The authority for these drawings comes from Mrs. Herbert.
Do you think that she is a woman who enjoys... having a crowd of people kick her gravel around... or move her earth like a pack of dogs in a herb garden?
I would seek peace and quiet in a garden... and noise and excitement at a carnival.
Carnem levare.
So Mr. Neville, you would reserve your revelries... for a religious occasion.
And what of Gethsemane?
A wild sort of garden I shouldn't wonder.
There would be no geometric paths... and no Dutch bulbs.
We have a Cedar of Lebanon... and a Judas tree.
Perhaps we could cultivate a Tree of Heaven?
The gardens of England are becoming jungles.
Such exotics are grossly unsuitable.
If the Garden of Eden was planned for
England, God would have seen to it.
The Garden of Eden... was originally intended for Ireland.
For it was there that St.
Patrick eradicated the snake.
The only useful eradication in Ireland... was performed by
William of Orange... four years ago on my birthday.
And happy birthday to you Mr. Talmann.
If you are not too old to receive presents... perhaps the gardener and I can find a snake for your Orangerie.
What?
Good day to you, Mr. Neville.
Good day, Madam.
Philip.
I see the company is assembled.
And what are we to be spectators of?
You must not be surprised.
We are here at your request.
I did not request an audience... nor a dinner on the grass.
Perhaps we are to applaud... the view.
The scribbler is never satisfied.
He is as insatiable as a...
You've said that Mr.
Talmann should be here... dressed as you asked and carrying a gold-topped cane.
We have taken you at your word.
There was another instruction, but conveniently I have forgotten it.
Whistling, Sarah.
So much for convenience.
You do not catch me in the best of tempers... wearing yesterday's clothes.
I give you 20 minutes only.
I have a horse to exercise.
Then, Sir, please take your place.
I will take a walk.
Come with me, Maria.
We have a dog to exercise.
A little to the left, if you please.
And puff out your cheeks.
Why should I do that?
Because last time you were whistling.
A tune perhaps not readily recognizable... even by its own composer.
Look, Madam... this man has no head.
A typical German characteristic.
Mr. Neville... you're talking about my son-in-law.
By the grace of God... you are to have a grandson by him... some day.
Is that not a better thing to talk of?
And you mock my money and my person... to draw caricatures.
With my memory, 3 pictures in the house... and your knowledge of the subject...
I intend to place the head of Mr. Herbert... on these shoulders... as an appropriate acknowledgment... of your husband and his property.
If he should return?
Why, Madam, what a strange thing to say?
If he should return home to me.
So...
I am grieving... because Mr. Herbert... is away.
Yes, Mother.
The Contract is void, Mr. Neville.
I cannot meet you again.
Mrs. Herbert, sit here.
Move your head into the shade.
Don't you think the gardeners have excelled themselves?
You should not continue to draw.
I'm not able to continue the terms of our contract.
The fee is yours, as is the hospitality.
I was about to say... that in spite of my satisfaction at continuing... the prospect in such delightful circumstances... the peak of my delight is obtained in those short minutes... when we are together.
I would regret losing them.
Besides, I do not need to remind you... that the contract was made between two people.
It will take the consent of both signatories to make it void.
I feel that from this position I cannot adequately see... what I'm supposed to be seeing and...
I must therefore ask you to find some other resting-place.
At least until 4 o'clock... when our next meeting is to be consummated as arranged.
Who is this child who walks the garden... with such a solemn look on his face?
That is my husband's nephew.
He attracts servants like a little midget King.
What is his patrimony?
His father was killed at Ausbergenfeld.
His mother became a Catholic.
So my husband brought him to England.
To be reared as a little Protestant.
He was an orphan and needed to be looked after.
An orphan... because his mother became a Catholic?
Philip, find out what's happening.
Mr. Neville, Sir...
I'm sorry about the coat.
It was not I that put it there.
Is that so, Madam... then who did?
I'll ask.
No, don't ask. Leave it there.
Someone is getting careless.
The garden is becoming a robe-room.
I wonder what they keep in their clothespress.
Plants perhaps.
Who will be your husband's direct heir after you?
A future grandson... though not after me.
Mr. Herbert does not believe... in a woman owning property.
And what about your daughter and her husband?
They would be guardians on a grandson's behalf.
Do you intend to study legal matters?
You must forgive my curiosity.
Open your knees.
To have possession of my person... is not an excuse to be privy to my husband's Will.
Your loyalty is exemplary.
But what will happen to the estate if your daughter has no heirs?
I don't like to think about it.
The estate was my father's.
Mr. Herbert obtained it through marriage to me.
It is imperative,
Augustus, that in representing me... you ask of yourself the very best.
And you do not fraternize with whomsoever you choose.
And chasing sheep is a tiresome habit best left to shepherds.
If Mr. Neville chases sheep he is not to be emulated.
Drawing is an attribution worth very little... and in England worth nothing at all.
If you must scribble...
I suggest that your time would be better spent in studying mathematics.
I will engage a tutor... and, who knows, one day you, Augustus... may add the Talmann name to the Royal Society.
Augustus... your tutor of course must be German.
There are already far too many English influences on your life as it is.
Mr. Neville is our resident draughtsman.
He is making one or two drawings of Mr. Herbert's house and estate.
I've heard of your prowess, Mr. Neville.
Indeed I've heard more than that.
I've heard you're not a conventional man.
Mr. Neville has planned his stay here... like an officer in a hostile billet.
We've orders to appear and disappear... to wear cocked hats, to eat meals in the open air... and to prepare furniture for inspection.
And yet, Louis...
I hear that you're not averse to exchanging exercise... on a new horse for standing to attention in the hot sun... like a halberdier.
What control you must exercise Mr. Neville.
You might be better employed as a military man... than as someone who merely draws a landscape.
Mrs. Herbert... whatever is the price you must pay... to capture this general who leads the wheat by the ear.
Mrs. Herbert pays no price she cannot afford.
Thanks to her generosity, I am permitted to take my pleasure... without hindrance on her property... and to enjoy the maturing delights of her country garden.
And, gentlemen... there is much there to be surprised at... and applauded.
Board!
Good Afternoon, Mr. Talmann.
Good afternoon, Mr. Neville.
You are late.
I heard the clock strike four some minutes ago.
That is indeed true.
I met Mr. Porringer.
I'm becoming Mr. Porringer's taster of victuals.
Does the same thing happen to you?
Today, it was raspberries.
I congratulate you on today's raspberries... but not on yesterday's damsons.
They were tasteless, "geschmacklos".
Like your coat Mr. Talmann.
There is no way... that I was going to wear that coat a third day.
We are indeed... losing the novelty of this situation.
First I was graced with the presence of Mrs. Talmann... two servants, a maid and a meal served on silver-plate.
Now what have we?
Yourself dressed in the wrong clothes.
Mr. Neville, enough.
Your enthusiasm for complaint knows no limit.
For a fee of 8 pounds your impertinence is too expensive.
Would you have me be impertinent for nothing?
For nothing...
I would have you run off my property.
Good day.
Your property, Mr. Talmann?
Mr. Talmann, you've forgotten your riding-boots.
They are not mine, Mr. Neville.
I felt sure that they were yours.
Why doesn't your husband have the moat cleaned out?
He doesn't like to see the fish.
Carp live too long.
They remind him of Catholics.
Besides from his window... the duckweed could be mistaken for lawn.
Can he swim?
I've never seen him swim.
Good morning, Mrs. Herbert.
This morning I'm progressing well.
I am beginning to enjoy myself.
Would you be so good as to sit?
It's a little chilly perhaps, but I think you tremble too much.
It is not easy for me this way to use your person... as I would like to.
Would you stand?
The ladder, as you can see, has now become... a meretricious vertical.
But I forgive you for standing it there.
What use have I for the ladder.
It does not go anywhere.
Would you be so good as to kneel?
Kneel, Madam.
If you have any influence over your son-in-law...
I suggest that he travel over to Mr. Seymour's to see... what can be done with limes... by doing as little as possible.
Limes, Madam... can smell so sweet.
Especially when they are allowed to bloom without hindrance.
And it will shortly be time to bloom.
Is it true... that you would wish to see Mr. Herbert dead?
I've no great love for Mr. Herbert.
Goodness, a provocative question.
Then why stay?
Mr. Noyes has a great attachment to my mother, Mr. Neville.
I'm employed by Mr.
Herbert as Estate Manager.
Mr. Herbert is often away... and I can make myself useful to Mrs. Herbert.
In more ways than one I presume.
But is it not that way which is most important?
Your questions... are far too imprudent and provocative in this company.
Then you'd rather I asked them behind your back?
Mr. Noyes' position in this house is well known to us all.
It is a... a difficult position.
I'm surprised that you all concur in it.
The organization of this house is Mr. Herbert's affair.
My father and Mr. Noyes were once great friends.
And then?
My mother was at one time promised to Mr. Noyes.
Your position Mr. Noyes is then a consolation.
You overstep your privileges in being a guest in Mrs. Herbert's house.
Sit down, Mr. Noyes.
I merely pursue an enquiry.
It may help me to understand what is happening in the garden.
That shirt, Mr. Neville, is prominent enough in your drawing.
Would it be possible to disguise its presence?
I try very hard...
never to distort or to dissemble.
Would that always be you method of working?
It would.
Well... let me make a little speech.
In your drawing of the north side of the house... my father's cloak lies wrapped around a figure of Bacchus.
In the drawing of the prospect over which... my husband turns an appreciative gaze... you will have noticed that there is unclaimed a pair of riding boots.
In the drawing of the park from the east side... it is possible to see leaning against my father's wardroom... a ladder usually put to use for the collecting of apples.
And in the drawing of the laundry... there is a jacket of my father's slit across the chest.
Do you not think that before long you might find the body... that inhabited all those clothes?
I am thinking very hard about the drawing you've left out.
And you, Madam, were in that drawing.
Are you sure?
The sound of you was in the drawing.
You were playing the spinet.
I thought that we had discussed... the pictorial equivalents of noise without conclusion.
Perhaps it was not me playing the spinet.
Have you thought of that?
Then who was it?
You see, Mr. Neville, you are already beginning... to play the game rather skilfully.
Four garments and a ladder... do not lead us to a corpse.
I said nothing about a corpse.
You are ingenious.
It is as if you'd planned it.
Your father is in Southampton.
He would not miss his clothes or notice the ladder.
Is my father in Southampton,
Mr. Neville?
My mother told you that.
And you must realize that she is a lady of few words... and not incapable of a few stratagems.
Haven't you thought how hard... she persuaded you to be her draughtsman... to draw her husband's house while her husband was away?
Her explanation for that can be supported.
Perhaps you have taken a great deal on trust.
I look forward to the eventual purpose and... outcome of this ingenuity.
My last six drawings will be redolent of the mystery.
I will proceed step by step to the heart of the matter.
Perhaps to the heart of my father?
Lying crimson on a piece of green grass?
What a pity that your drawings are in black and white.
You rush ahead.
The items are innocent.
Taken one by one, they could so be construed.
Taken together you could be regarded as a witness to misadventure.
Misadventure?
What misadventure?
There is no misadventure.
And more than a witness.
An accessory to misadventure.
You are fanciful.
Mr. Neville...
I have grown to believe that a really... intelligent man makes an indifferent painter.
For painting requires a certain blindness.
A partial refusal to be aware of all the options.
An intelligent man will know more about... what he is drawing than he will see.
And in the space between knowing and seeing, he will become... constrained... unable to pursue an idea strongly.
Fearing that the discerning, those who he is eager to please... will find him wanting if he does not put in... not only what he knows, but what they know as well.
You, Mr. Neville... if you are an intelligent man and thus an indifferent painter... will perceive that a construction such as I have suggested... could well be placed on the evidence contained in you drawing.
If you, are as I have heard tell... a talented draughtsman... then I imagine that you could suppose that the objects...
I have drawn you attention to, form no plan... stratagem or indictment.
Indictment, Madam?
You are ingenious.
I am allowed to be neither of the two things... that I wish to be at the same time.
I propose... since I am in a position to throw a connecting plot over... the inconsequential items in your drawing... an interpretative plot that I could explain to others... to account for my father's disappearance.
And there's no word now of my father having arrived in Southampton.
I propose that we could come to... some arrangement... that might protect you... and humor me.
I suggest that we come to a similar arrangement... as you have struck with my mother.
I would like you now to accompany me to the library... where I know that
Mr. Noyes is waiting for us.
And for each remaining drawing to agree.
And for each remaining drawing to agree.
To meet Mrs Talmann, in private.
And to agree to meet
Mrs. Talmann in private.
And to comply with her requests... concerning her pleasure with me.
And to comply with her requests... concerning her pleasure with me.
Drawing Number 7.
From 7 o'clock in the morning until 9...
the front prospect of the house will be kept clear...
of members of the household, household servants...
horses and carriages.
Drawing Number 8.
From 9 o'clock in the morning until 11...
the gardens in front of the bath house building...
will be kept clear.
No coals will be burnt to cause smoke...
to issue from the bath house chimney.
From 11 o'clock in the morning until 1...
the yew tree walk in the center of the lower garden...
will be kept completely clear...
and all members of
Mr. Herbert's family...
members of his household staff and animals.
It is time, Mr. Neville.
From 2 o'clock in the afternoon until 4...
the back of the house and the sheep pasture...
on the eastern side, will be kept free of all members...
of the household and farm servants.
The reason I've suggested you come here is... because I've borrowed this painting from the house.
Would you stand?
Are you not intrigued by it?
I confess I have paid it little attention.
Your husband surprises me... with his eccentric and eclectic taste.
Whilst most of his peers are content to collect portraits... mostly of an edifying family connection...
Mr. Herbert seems to collect anything.
Perhaps he has eye for optical theory.
Or the plight of lovers.
Or the passing of time.
What do you think?
Perhaps, Madam, he has... and I would stand by him in this... an interest in the pictorial conceit.
Can you see why your husband had reason to buy it'?
It's of a garden.
That's reason enough.
True, but what of the events that are happening within it?
Shall we peruse it together?
Do you see... a narrative in these apparently unrelated episodes?
Theirs drama is there not in this overpopulated garden.
What intrigue is here?
Do you think the characters have something to tell us?
Would you know if your daughter... had any particular interest in this painting?
Could you put a season to it?
Do you have an opinion?
What infidelities are portrayed here?
Do you think...
that murder is being prepared?
Did you hear that a horse had been found at Strides... which is about three miles from here on the road... if followed long enough could lead you to Southampton.
I will stay dressed,
Mr. Neville, you will not.
Mr. Clarke says the horse has been badly treated.
All roads can lead to
Southampton... if the traveler on horse is ingenious enough.
I've heard of a horse that found its way to Dover... and boarded a ship taking hay to Calais.
The French do not treat horses kindly.
They eat them.
Was your horse partly eaten?
May I leave my hat on?
Your chair looks insignificant out there, Mr. Neville.
What significant assumption are we to make... of a wounded horse belonging to your father... found on the road to Southampton?
The first assumption is... that the horse has no business being there without my father... and why is it wounded... and what does that imply for my father?
And the second assumption will no doubt implicate me... since a saddle-less horse has found... its way into this morning's drawing.
Mrs. Talmann... why don't you now leave the window... and come to the basin.
Don't worry... your position of superiority won't be diminished.
I will still have to look up to you.
Since I have taken valuable time... to fill this basin with a little water... why not share it with me?
You have a curious mole, Mrs. Herbert... and it is ideally placed.
Does your gardener catch moles, Mrs. Herbert?
No, he says they are to be encouraged... for good luck and the destruction of one's enemies.
They trip up horses, Mrs. Herbert.
You will not persuade Mr.
Porringer to persecute them.
A curious man... and ideally placed.
Ideally placed for what?
Why for persuading a fine white horse... from Southampton to go lame in the leg.
You have nothing to fear from Mr. Porringer, Mr. Neville.
He watches you for his own amusement.
As I do you, Madam.
You seem nonetheless to be curiously keen to protect your gardener.
It is not you... but his breeches that are his best defense.
A man in red breeches could scarcely be considered... an inconspicuous conspirator.
Unlike that other fool who behaves like a statue when you least expect.
Away from the house, Mr. Neville...
I feel I grow smaller in significance.
Madam, what signifies, does not grow smaller for me.
Your significance Mr. Neville is attributable to both... innocence and arrogance in equal parts.
You can handle both with impunity, Mrs. Talman.
But you will find that they are not symmetrical.
You will find that one weighs heavier than the other.
Which do you think is the heavier?
Your innocence, Mr. Neville... is always sinister.
So I will say that the right one is the heaviest.
Your dexterity is admirable.
You spend too much time with Mr. Neville.
How is that?
The man is a pariah.
He eats like a vagrant and dresses like a barber.
What compliments.
I think he would be amused.
As for his servant... he looks like a fleece with a foot disease.
Don't you think
Mr. Neville is knowledgeable?
About what?
About what, Madam?
I could take your silence as provocation.
And why should I wish to provoke you?
To excite me to think that you might wish... to compliment Mr.
Neville with more than praise... for his knowledgability.
The complexity of your speech does you credit... but it far exceeds the complexity of any relationship...
I might have with Mr. Neville... which is indeed very simple.
He's a paid servant of my mother's... bound by a contract.
That is all.
I'm encouraged by my mother to see him honor it.
Is his pleasure in your encouragement so necessary?
Although Mr. Neville has qualities... he is neither as intelligent nor... as talented as he thinks.
Both characteristics you have observed from the start, Louis.
Though I admit more by prejudice than by observation.
I understand that you will be leaving us tonight, Mr. Neville.
With Mrs. Herbert's permission...
I will be leaving after the arrival of Mr. Herbert... and after he has passed an opinion on the drawings of his house.
If my servant has obtained a vehicle...
I will be leaving in the morning.
And, of course, Mr.
Neville, the sooner the better... as you expected me to say.
You Sir, have acquainted me with your opinion on drawing... on horticulture, the
Roman church, childbearing... the place of women in
English life, the history... and politics of
Lubeck, and the training of dogs.
So I am in a fair position... to anticipate your opinions to my departure.
Is Radstock to greet you with such devoted hospitality?
Mr. Talmann...
I have been treated with as great hospitality... as I could wish for in Mrs. Herbert's house.
Your drawings are full of the most unexpected observation, Mr. Neville.
Looking at them is a kin to pursuing a complicated allegory.
- Are you sure this ladder was there?
- Indisputably.
- And what's this? It looks like...
- Whatever it is, it was there.
Mrs. Talisman will confirm it.
How is that?
How will my wife confirm it?
Mr. Neville is probably too encompassing in his statement.
I can, however, confirm the sighting of a ladder.
It is propped against my father's with drawing-room.
It is indeed Madam.
You have an exact knowledge.
As exact a knowledge as though... you had placed it there yourself, would you say?
Mr. Neville, if ever I had such a mind to...
I would have found it impossible to have lifted it.
It would have taken... two men.
Away!
What do you want, Mr. Clarke?
Can you come with me, Sir.
It's important.
It is most important that
I speak with you.
I cannot now, Thomas.
I am in a position to insist.
After what has happened,
I refuse to speak to you now.
Take care of affairs yourself... or in the last resort, ask Mr. Talmann.
Telling Mr. Talman what is on my mind will not help you.
What do you mean?
I am sure I'm shortly to be accused of the murder of your husband.
I'm determined to confront that eventuality well protected.
Who will accuse you?
Firstly, I think will be your son-in-law... abetted and witnessed probably by his servants.
- How can that be?
- I need your assistance.
To what end?
If my son-in-law believes that you're guilty of the murder of Mr. Herbert.
Leave me.
Maria!
Calling your servants is not going to help.
What do you mean?
Maria!
I mean the draughtsman's contract.
What of it?
Maria, call Mr. Talmann.
I mean your contractual obligations to Mr. Neville.
What of them?
You are disingenuous beyond words.
Don't bother to call Mr. Talmann.
Fetch me instead a...
Fetch me nothing.
I'm not thirsty just at present.
Now...
Mr. Noyes, what are you inferring?
I am to be unjustly and unscrupulously accused... of the murder of your husband.
On what grounds?
That I was the most likely person to have done it.
I was the only person, except your servants... to know of Mr.
Herbert's return on Friday.
I am culpable because of my known feelings towards your husband.
That is ridiculous, there was...
I am the only person in the group of people you are about to mention... who was not at home awaiting the arrival of Mr. Herbert.
And, further, because of my known feelings towards you.
Is all that sufficient reason?
There is more.
Mr. Herbert's study is mysteriously littered... with papers and my gloves are there.
Now against this conspiracy...
I need your protection... and more.
If you're guilty,
Thomas, you shall have neither.
With Mr. Neville's contract...
I shall have them both.
For your protection and for seven hundred guineas...
I will trade you the contract of your infidelities.
I have no money.
Seven hundred is a calculated sum.
I will trade you the contract for the drawings.
You have 12 drawings... and Mr. Neville has a reputation.
What for 12 drawings executed privately?
Consider, Madam.
The drawings could be construed as an embarrassment to you.
And the original purpose and significance... of the drawings as a gift to your husband is absolved.
Those drawings, Mr. Noyes... have cost me too much already.
They may cost you a great deal more.
They may cost you possibly everything.
An adulteress with a dead husband is no reputation to relish.
And Mr. Neville?
What of Mr. Neville?
He's gone to Radcote.
What part is he in this stratagem?
He is not part of my stratagem.
He could be party to a future arrangement with the same intent.
You paid him a fee, Madam... and you offered him full board on your property during the commission.
To the prying eye that is as much as he is usually worth.
With the contract in your hand and then destroyed... why should the world think you have offered him more?
Where is that contract now?
I have it here.
Where are the drawings?
What would be said if I no longer had the drawings?
That you destroyed them.
For without your husband they were valueless to you.
What would happen if it were known... that they were for sale?
Your stratagem is weak.
That you sold them... in order to afford a memorial to your husband... or alternatively... that you sold them in order to rid the house... of something which pains you each time you look at them.
You once asked me if I could... supply you with a ribald piece of gossip.
I remember your friendly gesture at the time.
Madam, you Romans know how to be charitable.
I can supply you with a little more than gossip.
I invite you to help me... elaborate and decorate such an item.
An entertaining item.
We need not work too hard for the rump... of the matter has been well laid.
What real benefit do you think I might gain... from this exercise?
Amusement... and a certain delight in a symmetrical stratagem.
And the satisfaction that our betters... might be discomforted.
And who knows, perhaps... two parterres and a grove of orange trees.
If Mrs. Herbert is generous.
And why Mrs. Herbert?
Because I think you will find she is mistress of strategy.
If you don't benefit from her directly...
I think that, if you wait a few years... then you will achieve them from me... as a token of my esteem.
From the same source?
I think you have understood me.
A monument would need a designer.
Would a certain pecuniary draughtsman... be eager to sign another contract?
As far as I am aware, the idea is Mrs. Herbert's.
Though the expenses might be laid at Mr. Neville's door.
An about face.
It is his drawings that are to be sold.
Not more of his talent.
By Mr. Neville's growing reputation...
12 drawings could be profitably sold... to furnish a more solid and enduring monument.
It is said that Mr. Neville is to be invited to The Hague.
If I had the wherewithal...
I would advance Mrs.
Herbert one hundred guineas... straight away for capital audacity... for bravura in the face of grief.
Mr. Herbert is no especial excuse for such generosity.
But how publicly directed is the gesture?
How could posterity doubt her affection?
Just so.
I shall offer 300 guineas, not my own money, you understand.
My father-in-law's can afford it... he collects, has no perspicacity, no knowledge.
I shall tell him... that they are Italian...
Guido Reni...
Modesta.
He shall hang them in the darkroom... and they shall never be seen again.
That is a pity... for they are full of illuminating details.
Mr. Neville moves forward in
Mrs. Herbert's susceptibilities... like a man pressing a life-work by slow stages.
Would there perhaps be an idea in Mr. Neville's imagination... for a certain contract to cap them all?
On horseback, a dashing St. George... looking like a Jacobite with...
With a palette for a shield and quiver full of brushes... and a pen held crosswise in his teeth.
With ink stained fingers.
What is in his fingers?
Unmentionable.
Another pen?
It's like a pen.
Is it a pen?
A little pen.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
We will forward 400 guineas... to this scabrous monument to a pen.
And our receipt will be Mr. Neville's drawing in the bath-house.
The one with the little dog.
Wagging its tail.
Mrs. Herbert does well to sell them.
How much will they bring?
They are worth what those who buy them wish to pay.
Mr. Seymour has tentatively offered four hundred guineas.
I am inclined to think that he makes his offer generous... to Mrs. Herbert in order to interest her in a larger and... a grander sale.
What other sale?
Why, of course, of the house.
That was very forward to him.
I tested his ambition by suggesting... that he might buy a set of distinguished drawings of it.
Either way is a useful way to help Mrs. Herbert to a... more profitable bargain... and thereby to help her demonstrate her loss... in the knowledge that a larger sum would make... for a larger monument for her husband.
Mr. Herbert, one way or another... stands to benefit by Mr. Neville's industry.
As do we all.
I fail to see, for a start, my benefit, or for that matter, yours.
Mr. Talmann, you are disingenuous.
You as by your leave... your future son's future guardian... stand in an enviable position.
Consider the neatness of it.
The estate would have an endurable memorial... which is part of the landscape, instead of 12 perishable items... which are mere representations of it.
I fail to see why Mr.
Seymour's presumption... should gain him a part of my son's inheritance.
Maybe there again...
Mr. Seymour will be doing you a favor.
What do you mean?
By taking away the possibility of your son ever seeing them... when you have one, as I'm sure you will.
Why should he not see them?
Because he might perceive the allegorical evidence... in them which you might be stubborn enough to deny.
Mr. Neville had no use for allegory... and I am unlikely to miss what my son would appreciate.
An allegorical meaning that might involve his mother.
What? My Wife? How is that?
It is fancifully imputed... that Mr. Neville saw you as a deceived husband.
How was I deceived?
I've been convinced, Sarah... that you have been deceiving me.
What is the matter with your voice?
Damn my voice.
If you did, it would scare me less.
What's the matter with your face?
Your face, Louis, is very red.
No redder than your backside... when Mr. Neville had finished with it.
When your speech is as coarse as your face, Louis... you sound as impotent by day as you perform by night.
Night and Day your behavior has been coarse... and is no down in corresponding black and white... for all the world to peer at, whether the sun shines... or the wind blows, hot or cold.
Your speech, Louis, is becoming meteorological.
Explain your conceit.
It is no conceit but
Mr. Neville's drawings.
I was sure you believed Mr. Neville incapable of complicated meaning.
What has he done now?
It is mostly what he has undone.
It seems to be your person.
I have no control over
Mr. Neville's drawings.
He draws what he pleases.
He is not paid to draw for his own pleasure, nor for yours.
What makes you think he has done that?
- The way it looks.
- How does it look'?
- The way the world sees it.
- The world!
There cannot be that many people who have seen these drawings.
Who are these people that represent the world?
Seymour, Noyes, the Poulencs.
What do they see?
Enough to delight them... to exercise their tongues, to discuss patrimony.
Or the lack of it.
They see then what they have long been searching for.
Do you think?
And that means?
An opportunity to braid you for not producing an heir.
Woman, it takes two.
It does indeed, Sir.
You amaze me.
What has that to do with Mr. Neville?
- I could ask you that.
- You did not. You asked Mr. Noyes.
It was he who pointed it out to me.
With his long nose he could point you in any way he wishes.
Madam... you'll look at those drawings... and you'll explain to me... why a ladder is placed under your window... and why your revolting little dog is outside the bath-house... and why your walking-clothes casually decorate... the bushes of the yew-walk.
Your inventory,
Louis, is unlimited... like you long, clean, white breeches.
But there is nothing of substance in either of them.
Let me ask you.
Perhaps you can explain what your boots were doing in the sheep-field.
- They were not my boots.
- Why was your undershirt idling... on a hedge near the statue of Hermes?
It was not my shirt.
Can you not see... the drift of this domestic inquisition?
You are answering me as I could answer you.
You cannot deny it is your dog.
And whereas, with your final accusation.
You pursue the ambiguity of an abandoned sunshade.
You are complete on paper... in a borrowed hat and a borrowed coat... and a borrowed shadow I shouldn't wonder.
Posing with your knees tucked in... and arse tucked out... and a face like a Dutch fig... and a supercilious Protestant whistle, I shouldn't wonder... on your supercilious smug lips.
And Louis... you have always said that
Mr. Neville has no imagination.
He draws what he sees.
Whose patrimony were you apeing then?
My father's?
The world knows that he is dead... and is not certain who killed him.
The world might peer at those drawings... and ask what conspiracy of inheritance... did Mr. Neville have for you.
You are disreputable.
You side with a tenant-farmer's son against your husband.
You have married the grand-daughter of an army victualler.
There is nothing that I have said that suggests I side with Mr. Neville.
I hope you will agree that he has been useful to us all.
What have you done with his drawings?
I've bought them for 600 guineas and plan to destroy them.
It would be a pity to destroy them.
You are concerned that posterity... will know of your duplicity.
Louis... they contain evidence of another kind.
A kind more valuable than that seized upon by those titillated... by a scandal that smears your honor.
Evidence that Mr.
Neville may be cogniscent... to the death of my father.
Good morning, Madam.
Mr. Neville.
Good morning, Sir.
Good morning.
Though the summer suddenly seems past and the weather less than good.
What has brought you back to Anstey so soon?
I thought our humble estate had seen the last of you.
I am staying at Radstock with the Duke of Lauderdale... and have come at the invitation of Mr. Seymour... to find that curiously he is out and most of his house is shut up.
Mr. Seymour is in
Southampton with my husband.
The funeral was three days ago and they are discussing property.
It would seem then that my visit is poorly timed.
May I ask after the health of your mother?
Although my mother was understandably disturbed... by my father's death, she is now... from the knowledge that her affection for my father... can never be reciprocated... at ease.
And what of yourself?
I am very well, Mr. Neville.
And we are thriving.
Mr. Van Hoyten is to consider for us a new management... of the grounds in an entirely fresh approach.
He has come at our request to soften the geometry... that my father found to his taste, and to... introduce a new ease and complexion to the garden.
Mr. Van Hoyten has worked in The Hague... and he has presented
Mr. Talmann with some novel... introductions which we will commence next spring.
He is a draughtsman too.
Mr. Neville has come, Mother... as we both believed he might.
He has brought with him a rare gift from Radstock.
Three pomegranates from
Lauderdale's gardener... reared in English soil under an English sun.
But with the help of one hundred panes of glass... and half a year's supply of artificial heat.
Thank you Mr. Neville.
We must see what we can do for you in return.
I was about to take Mr.
Van Hoyten to the river.
He has plans to make a dam... and flood the lower field.
I will no doubt see you later, Mr. Neville.
Flooded fields, Madam?
Do you plan to join Anstey to the sea?
We are to have an ornamental lake.
My son-in-law has ambitions for his countrymen.
It is probably you that has opened his eyes... to the possibilities of our landscape.
Why is this Dutchman waving his arms about?
Is he homesick for windmills?
Who knows?
He's a man with new ideas.
New ideas demand new methods, perhaps.
How was Radstock?
Fine enough, Madam... but dull after the excitements of Anstey.
Have you now come here to renew those excitements?
That would be presumptuous.
It would indeed.
All contracts have been honored... and the body has been buried.
That was blunt.
I remember that you were blunt... in your dealings with me.
I was glad to see Mrs. Talmann... and in all truth, put as much a possibility as I could... to see that a meeting with yourself might occur.
I was curious to see the house and gardens again.
To see what appearance they'd put on after this week of changing weather.
But I admit that it was out of curiosity to see you... was behind the reason for my wishing... to be invited to
Mr. Seymour's house.
Curiosity... dies bit sound a very respectful reason to visit a lady.
Even one you've had the pleasure of.
Is it really myself that is the center of your interest and not my daughter?
Yes, Madam.
How's that?
My former contractual obligations... tied us together to my advantage, and at your husband's death... it was again I who gained and you who lost.
Very confident of that, Mr. Neville.
I must confess that in losing... you have excited my curiosity further.
How do you imagine my losses...
Mr. Neville?
Humiliations, Madam.
Each one exceeding the other.
Is losing a husband a humiliation...
Mr. Neville?
In making my arrangements here...
I concluded with the possibility of 13 sites... one of which had to be rejected to comply... with the 12 drawings
as commissioned.
The site that was rejected was... as you will recall, to the south of the house... and included the monument to the horse.
It is the site where your husband's body was found.
It was that irony that was uppermost in enquiring minds... at the discovery of Mr. Herbert's body.
The thirteenth site was rejected... for no clear reason.
It contained no view of the house... then that was true of several other of the drawings.
It was the least characteristic of the garden's viewpoints... and was most powerful at the least advantageous times of day.
And that is why, with your permission...
I would like, if I may... to attempt to accomplish that drawing this afternoon.
That is, if you have no objection.
Mr. Neville... your approach is full of hesitant pleasantries.
That is because I am still unable to fully judge... your present feelings as to past events.
Mr. Neville, suffice it to say that the object of my life has changed.
I am a widow whereas I was a wife.
It could be construed that I was a widow whilst being a wife.
I've only exchanged a false position that made me unhappy for... a true position... that has left me without any emotion.
Mr. Neville, I propose to eat... and I propose that you should eat with me.
When we are ready...
I will show, along with my gardener, Mr. Porringer... what we at Anstey are capable of cultivating.
It will be by way of returning your gift in kind.
And, who knows? It may be that we could revive... one more time... a liaison, outside of a contract... to our mutual satisfaction.
Then you must accomplish your thirteenth drawing.
Is all that acceptable to you?
It is as if you'd planed it.
I'm surprised... delighted.
I am overwhelmed.
Mr. Neville, I will take all three states... of your satisfaction into consideration.
I have... quite legitimately, a freedom to exploit... and I might as well exploit it with you... considering our past experience.
A pomegranate, Mr. Neville.
Gift of Hades to Persephone.
My scholarship is not profound.
Unusual of you, Mr. Neville... to profess to an ignorance of a subject which before... you would be anxious to have us believe was an essential... prerequisite to an artist's vocabulary.
Maybe I am hesitating to acknowledge an unintended allusion.
By eating the fruit of the pomegranate...
Pluto kept Persephone in the Underworld.
A symbolic fruit, Mrs. Herbert.
And you've brought me three.
That was all that Mr.
Clancy would spare me.
Maybe Mr. Clancy is a contriver of allusions.
How is that Mrs. Herbert?
Are you acquainted with the man?
Having been tricked into eating the fruit of the pomegranate...
Persephone was forced to spend a period of each year underground.
During which time, as even
Mr. Porringer will tell you...
Persephone's mother, the goddess of fields... of gardens and of orchards... was distraught, heart-broken.
She sulks... and she refuses, adamantly refuses... to bless the world with fruitfulness.
Mr. Porringer and... your Mr. Clancy try hard... to defeat the influence of the pomegranate... by building places like these.
Don't you think?
And having built them and stocked them and patiently tended them.
What do they grow?
Why, the pomegranate?
And we are turned full circle again.
Certainly a cautionary tale for gardeners.
And for mothers with daughters, Mr. Neville.
Who knows?
Pomegranates grown in England... might not have such unhappy allegorical significance.
Plants from the hot-house, according to Mr. Porringer, are seldom fertile.
Fertile enough, Mrs. Talmann... to engender felicitous allusions if not their own offspring.
And, of course, there are more.
More of what?
We well know your delight in the visual conceit.
The juice of the pomegranate... may be taken for... blood... and in particular the blood of the new born... and of murder.
Then thanks to your botanical scholarship... you must find it cruelly apt that I was persuaded to bring such fruit.
Mr. Neville...
I suspected you were innocent in the insight... as you have been innocent of much else.
Innocent, Madam?
By impute I was convinced you thought me guilty... certainly of opportunism.
Probably of murder.
What I do think you guilty of...
I do not at all reproach you for.
In our need of an heir... you may very likely have served us well.
Madam?
We had a contract, did we not?
You do not think I would have signed so much... for pleasures alone?
Madam... that was ingenious.
No.
Since when has adultery been ingenious?
Mr. Neville you are ridiculous.
And why should you have murdered Mr. Herbert?
For what reason?
Mr. Talmann believes
I had reason enough.
Yes, Mr. Talmann is in Southampton... still trying to find or invent... some responsibility for you in the matter.
He will not forgive your indiscretion with Sarah.
But he won't disown his wife, for then... he would lose Anstey.
I am sure that Mr. Talmann is not in Southampton... for did I not see him on the carriage drive here this afternoon.
I think not.
He is in Southampton, with Mr. Seymour.
I do not think that Mr. Seymour can be in Southampton.
For he stopped my servant this morning at Radstock to ask after me.
And on the understanding that
I had some hope of seeing you... was according to my servant, more than pleased.
I am convinced that we will see him this afternoon.
I confess I am surprised if that is the case.
I will enquire.
Sarah... ask Mr. Porringer to get Mr. Neville a chair.
He intends to make a drawing for me in the garden... by that horse.
And, Sarah... ask Mr. Porringer to bring Mr. Neville a pineapple.
A small one, they're sweeter.
You would care to try a pineapple would you not?
I would be delighted.
Good evening, Mr. Neville.
Good evening, Sir.
And why, Mr. Neville, do we find you here so late?
Surely the light is now too poor to see adequately.
That is true. I am finished.
Good.
Perhaps I could see it?
If we had light, that might be possible.
I'm sure we can find some light.
But it is not finished, Mr. Neville.
No, Mr. Talmann, it is not.
You may successfully hide your face in the dark... but in England it is not easy for you to hide your accent.
I did not think to hide my identity for long... which even in the eyes of the English is no especial crime... compared with the identity you care to assume with such ease.
And what identity might that be?
The identity of a man of some little talent... some dubious honor, a proper dealer in contracts.
The identity of a man with an eye to the improper pursuit... of dishonor to others.
You talk, Mr. Talmann, like one who has learnt abroad... an archaic way of speaking that became unfashionable... in England when my grandfather was a young man.
My speech is in no way dependable... on your view of fashion.
We all know that in the field of deeds and of talent... you in your field are an innovator.
That must be some sort of ﬂattery, Mr. Talmann.
Have your companions also come to flatter?
We have come merely as curious observers, Mr. Neville.
To wonder why after so much has happened... you return to continue to fix
Mr. Herbert's property on paper... and chose to draw this particular site?
I might be inclined to answer those questions... if I didn't feel that the truthful answers I would give... would in no way be of interest to you.
It is our belief, Mr. Neville, that in returning here... you are seeking a codicil to your original contract.
A codicil of a more permanent nature than the last one.
A lasting contract with a widow.
You speak, of course, Mr. Talmann, like a disinherited man.
Uninterested in painting or draughtsmanship.
Uninterested even in the prospect of the estate... you covet from this position.
An ideal site for a memorial, perhaps.
Do you think Mr. Herbert would have appreciated... the prospect of his estate?
As a landowner yourself, Mr. Seymour...
I leave you to judge.
For a man of property it is a view that might be enviable.
Though I think you are wrong to ascribe those... enviable thoughts to me.
Perhaps they should be ascribed... to my friend Mr. Noyes who is I think standing beside me.
A custodian of contracts.
A man who was given custody of private agreements... in black and white.
And how do you feel that Mr. Herbert... felt about these black and white contracts?
As his agent, his bailiff, his notary... his one-time friend, the close... though not close enough confidant of his wife.
I would have thought you would be the best person to answer that.
It is curious that you persist in asking me questions... which you are the most suitably situated to answer.
It has occurred to me that you might have advanced...
Mr. Herbert the information that was so discretionally... set down in black and white.
If he could have appreciated what it stood for is another matter.
He was blind to so much.
Certainly blind to considerable unhappiness.
Your understanding of
Mrs. Herbert's unhappiness... could in no way be considered profound or relevant.
I had access to some considerable... observation of her state of mind.
You won't forget that I was helped in that respect by... her daughter, your wife.
And was persistently persuaded by both ladies... to undertake the commission in the first place.
And they persuaded you with a view... that you might reconcile differences and not plunder them.
I am in no way responsible... for Mr. Herbert's death.
The affair is a mystery to me... though I have suspicions
Mr. Talmann...
Mr. Seymour, Mr. Noyes.
And if they were here, indeed of
Mrs. Herbert herself and Mrs. Talmann.
Ladies who both after all entered willingly into their contracts.
Is that why, Mr. Neville, you have just abused Mrs. Herbert further?
What a pity.
That was clever.
We now have a contract with you, Mr. Neville... and under conditions of our choosing.
The contract concerning our present pleasure... has three conditions.
It would be best served when you have removed your finery.
Take off you hat.
My hat has no contractual obligations with anyone.
The contract's first condition... and there's no need to write it down for you... will never see it, is to cancel your eyes.
Since we have now deprived you of your access to a living... this shirt on your back will be of no value to you.
It may well dress a scarecrow to frighten the crows.
Or be scattered about an estate... as ambiguous evidence... of an obscure allegory.
And the third condition of your contract... concomitant to the other two... and legally binding... and efficiently undertaken... and for what is a man without property... and foresight... is your death.
(WOMAN SINGING) You're always there when I need you
I can count on you all right
If the world would end
I'd just call you
And you'd fix it overnight
If I wanted the sun
I bet you
Would deliver it to me
You're always there when I need you
And I need you constantly
These are dangerous days we're living in
And many times I feel like giving in
But I never, never do
Instead I turn to you
You're too smart to be true
You're always there when I need you
Heaven must have sent you here
It's a miracle somehow
You make disasters disappear
You make everything I'm feeling
There is nothing you won't try
You're always there when I need you
And I'll need you till I die
CHORUS: Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
You're always there when I need you
I can count on you all right
If the world would end
I'd just call you
And you'd fix it overnight
If you wanted the sun I bet you
You'd deliver it to me
You're always there when I need you
And I need you constantly
Oh, I'm gonna need you, baby
CHORUS: Oh, baby, baby, baby
I'm gonna need you, baby
Gonna need you, babe
You're always there
I'm gonna need you, baby
Hey, your boot's ringing.
Oh, is that my boot? I thought it was yours.
Yes, well, I think
I'll take it outside.
Answer it here.
Yeah, answer it here.
Yeah, on second thought,
I think I'll answer it here.
Maxwell Smart, Agent 86 here.
Max, this is the Chief
This better be important, Chief.
What is your situation?
Well, I'm 10,000 feet in the air, facing a squad of killers, who, I think, know who I am.
How many?
Well, counting the guy with the gun in my face, 18.
Get rid of them and get back here immediately
Right, Chief.
Well, gentlemen, sorry, but orders are orders.
All right, you guys stay here.
I'll go out and get him and bring him back.
What is it now, Chief?
CHIEF: Max, I wanna know what's happening
MAXWELL: I'm falling at a speed of 120 miles an hour from a height of approximately 8,000 feet.
I'm gonna open my parachute.
Should be on the ground in two minutes.
Would you believe?
Two seconds.
Nations of the world, this is KAOS
The all powerful organization of evil and tyranny speaking to you from our secret headquarters
We have in our power a devastating new weapon, capable of systematically destroying all known fabrics which exist in the world
It is called the Nude Bomb
I am prepared to detonate this bomb in every single nation, eradicating each fiber, every last swatch of cloth, rendering the entire world completely nude
Every man, woman, and child on the face of this Earth is at the mercy of KAOS if our demands are not met
These demands will be forthcoming
That is all for now Have a nice day
CHIEF: Good work, 86.
You made it.
Hello, Chief.
Well, I see you're using the stair ramp.
Pretty tight security, eh? What's up?
A big one, 86.
KAOS.
KAOS?
The international organization of evil and rottenness, eh?
We're really up against it this time, 86.
The fate of the entire world is in your hands.
Oh, no, not again.
Well, okay, this time.
But next week,
I'm on vacation, Chief.
If you get in trouble then, it's your ass.
MAXWELL: You know, Chief, this Nude
Bomb might solve a lot of problems.
CHIEF: Such as? MAXWELL: Well, for one thing, flashers.
Only you would think of that, Max.
That's why they pay me the big bucks.
And there'd be no more trouble with concealed weapons.
I mean, if everyone is nude, there'll be no place to hide a gun or a knife.
Well, there is a place but it could be painful.
Activate the wash.
This is your team.
Now, Larabee, you already know.
Why don't the rest of you just introduce yourselves?
My name is Carruthers...
Just a minute.
Ladies first, please.
I'm Agent 36 and I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be working with the world's most well-known secret agent.
The Maxwell Smart.
Oh, you've heard of me.
Who hasn't?
You're a legend, 86.
While I was studying with the Spy Academy,
I reviewed every one of your cases.
Oh.
Well, wouldn't you like to hear my side of the story?
They think you're wonderful.
Oh, you have heard my side of the story.
I'm Dr. Jerry Krovney and this is my sister, Dr. Pam Krovney.
No kidding?
Listen, Doc, I got a little pain right about here.
See, I went to this Japanese restaurant and I had a chili dog and I got a...
Max, Max, they're not medical doctors, they're doctors in the field of technology.
They are computer analysts.
You're kidding?
That's fantastic.
BOTH: Thank you.
Okay old-timer, you're next.
My name is Carruthers.
I'm in charge of special tactical weaponry and logistical support.
I'm responsible for your life while you're on this assignment.
Well, I certainly hope you're up to it, old-timer, because there are a lot of people out there that would like to see me dead.
They're not all out there.
CHIEF: Deactivate the wash.
MAXWELL:
By the way, Chief, what was the nation's reaction to the KAOS broadcast?
Were they frightened?
CHIEF: Angry.
Angry?
Well, they interrupted a soap opera.
Which one?
As The Earth Turns
Well, I don't blame them.
That's my favorite soap opera.
Do you realize that
Jessica is knocked up...
CHIEF: Max, Max, please, please.
Could we get on with this, please?
Rendezvous point one.
The President should be calling in a minute and 20 seconds.
He's gonna let us know where to meet him.
Chief, your rear-view pipe.
What about it?
You got it?
Yes.
Let me have it.
What's the matter?
I think we're being followed.
I was right.
Duck, Chief.
CHIEF: Max!
She's on our side.
She's one of your team.
22 has been assigned to back you up.
Agent 86, Agent 22.
You shot at me.
I'm sorry.
But you drew your gun and
I had to protect myself.
Well, you could have killed me.
Oh, no.
I aimed for your gun.
I put my bullet in your barrel.
You put your bullet in my barrel?
Max?
Of course, the old bullet-in-the-barrel trick.
Well, suppose you'd missed and hit me?
Max, I want this to be a harmonious relationship.
Well, I'm sorry if I was out of line, 22.
I'm sure you're a very good marksperson, but we all make mistakes.
And if there's one thing I've learned in many, many years of experience, is that you cannot be too careful with your gun.
Excuse me.
Are you all right?
Missed it by that much.
Excuse me.
PITS.
Yes, Mr. President.
Right, Mr. President.
22, take cover.
Right, Chief.
See you later, 86.
Right, 22.
Where the hell did she go?
You know she graduated at the top of her class?
Majored in vanishing.
But she's always there when you need her.
Maxwell Smart, Agent 86 here.
PRESIDENT: This is the President speaking
Oh, how do you do,
Mr. President?
PRESIDENT: Mr. Smart, because of the highly sensitive nature of this Nude Bomb threat,
I've arranged for us to rendezvous in this unorthodox manner
(CAR HONKING) Than risk any form of security leak
Any form of what, sir?
(CAR HONKING) Security leak
I'm sorry, sir, but I can't hear you because of the traffic noise.
Security leak!
Oh, that?
Yes, sir, thank you.
Mr. Smart, I've just received the KAOS demands.
We're in severe trouble.
They're insisting the United
Nations pool its resources and pay KAOS a monthly rent of 10 billion dollars.
Well, that's blackmail, sir.
I know.
But my information is
(HONKING) The United Nations is ready to capitulate.
Oh, blow it out your ass!
Blow it out my what?
Oh, no, not you, 86.
Oh.
Now, listen.
They've called an emergency session of the Security Council.
They meet at noon.
Mr. Smart,
I want you to be there.
Right, sir.
Now, you realize, Mr. Smart, that once KAOS learns of your mission, they'll stop at nothing.
You'll be in imminent danger, constant jeopardy, facing death at every turn.
And loving it.
I don't think Carruthers expects us this early.
I hope he moved your things over from your old apartment.
22, we'll be out in about five minutes.
AGENT 22: Okay. Chief, you may have been followed.
A black truck just turned the corner.
Well, check it out.
AGENT 22: Will do.
And stay out of sight.
Right.
AGENT 22:
Watch your step, 86.
Now, remember, Max, when you use this entrance...
Got it, Chief.
You knock the bell and ring the knocker, right?
Right.
As I was explaining, Max, the door is the wall and the wall is the door.
Unless you make the mistake of ringing the bell or knocking on the door, then the wall will electrocute you.
You're early.
I'm not ready.
Max just came to pick up a few things, Carruthers.
We'll be out of your way in a minute.
CARRUTHERS: All right, in that case, I have in this box...
MAXWELL: Now, just a minute, Carruthers.
Let me see if I get this straight.
What you're trying to tell me is that that telephone activates that wall?
Actually it's not a telephone,
86, it's a master control panel.
There's another one over there.
Now, I have in this box...
Now wait a minute. What do I use for a telephone?
That stapler.
Now, I have in this...
A stapler telephone?
That's fantastic, Carruthers.
Can it also be used as a stapler?
No.
Oh, well, you better work on that.
What's in the box, Carruthers?
We don't have all day, you know.
We made you a new shoe phone, 86.
Touch tone dialing.
Very good.
And in the event you're indisposed, my latest innovation.
Shoe answer phone. Very practical, Carruthers.
Now, when you wanna go to bed, you press that top button there, and it activates the bedroom wall.
CARRUTHERS: And now, I've got to activate your filing cabinet.
Well, Carruthers has really done an exceptional job this time, hasn't he?
You know, you ought to thank him, Max.
You thank him, Chief.
The only thing that's on my mind right now is why is there a KAOS agent in my bedroom?
What the hell are you talking about?
(CLATTERING) Shh, listen.
Now, let's not be hasty, Max.
This could be one of Carruthers' men.
No chance. He would have mentioned it.
Look, just let me handle it, Chief, and above all, try not to panic.
Drop that gun and put up your hands.
Not you, Max.
Right.
Come over here.
Who are you and what are you doing here?
I'm Harrington. I'm on
Carruthers' special staff.
I came in here to make a last minute check for hidden microphones.
A likely story.
Don't trust him, Chief.
Why not?
Why not?
Why not?
Yes, why not?
Well, for one thing, he has a foreign accent.
A foreign accent?
I don't hear any foreign accent.
What kind of an accent?
What kind of an accent?
Chinese.
Chinese?
Would you believe Japanese?
Max, not another word.
Italian?
Let's see your identification.
All right, Harrington, you can go.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
MAXWELL: Hey, Chief, have you ever seen this?
This is a picture of Agent 13 and me.
That's Agent 13 in the trash can.
Agent 13 would be terrific on this case.
No! You're already dangerously overstaffed, Max.
But, Chief, Agent 13 is one of the best undercover men in the business.
Why, he could be in a room with you and you wouldn't even know it.
No! I wish you would reconsider, Chief.
I'm telling you, Agent
13 is one of the best.
He's top drawer.
Bottom drawer, Max.
13, what are you doing here?
We always work together, don't we, Max?
Not on this job.
Ma...
Let's go.
Chief, Chief, believe me, you cannot get anybody better than Agent 13 for this job.
22, can I see you a minute?
Sure, Chief.
Oh!
All right, all right, you can have Agent 13.
Thank you, Chief.
What's up?
Well, Max has to go to the United
Nations and you're gonna back him up.
Of course.
Good.
That girl worries me a lot, Chief.
Whatever happened to our regulations regarding female agents?
They're supposed to be unmarried, without dependents, and willing to fool around a lot.
Here comes that black truck!
Of course, the old big black truck trick.
CHIEF: Get down!
Max, take cover!
CHIEF: Max, watch out!
Well, Max, KAOS knows you're on the job.
I've never seen that maneuver before.
Falling over backwards and coming up shooting!
When did you first think of that?
The second my foot hit this banana peel.
PITS has picked Maxwell
Smart to work against us.
But it's to our advantage.
Stop mumbling through that ridiculous affectation.
This affectation, my dear Nino, is more than a disguise.
It's my latest innovation.
Besides being perfectly coordinated stylistically with this ensemble, this fabric filters every last particle, each microorganism of a polluted world.
I'm telling you, Maxwell Smart has been put on the case!
Maxwell Smart is a fool and a bumbler.
So how do you explain how this bumbler has been able to thwart KAOS constantly in the past?
He's a lucky bumbler.
I also know an attempt was made on his life.
Did you order that?
Yes, he's dangerous.
On the contrary, my dear
Nino, he's invaluable.
I planted a double agent in PITS.
Hence, we have on
Maxwell Smart's team, a constant conduit of information who will apprise us of every move he makes.
You're really taking over, aren't you?
I rather look upon my contribution as an enormous help to both of us.
It's no help to have
Smart go to the UN.
He could convince them we don't mean business.
An antidote to that is to drop the bombs.
Drop the bombs! That's all you think, drop the bombs!
We'll drop the bombs when I say drop the bombs!
Calm down, dear Nino.
I don't understand these outbursts.
You've become highly irrational since that explosion in your laboratory.
When you lost your eye, your arm, your leg, your larynx.
What's wrong with you?
You're a fool!
If we kill the goose, where is the golden egg?
If we destroy the world, who'll pay us the money?
However, your plan does have some merit.
We'll drop just a few bombs.
Limited warfare!
Very civilized.
(MEN CONTINUE
SPEAKING RUSSIAN)
COMMANDER: Present...
Halt!
PLAYER: Let's give these fans what it's worth.
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please, please.
Let us not panic!
It is perfectly obvious to me what has happened here.
KAOS has merely tried to confuse us by using the old fake naked trick.
Of course, the old fake naked trick. Yes!
What's the old fake naked trick?
They have employed and hired hundreds of people to appear naked in different countries throughout the entire world.
It's an old trick, but they have not fooled me.
In a top secret discussion of such a sensitive nature, we cannot risk being bugged.
I suggest that we activate the Cones of Silence.
OFFICIAL:
For security reasons, we shall activate the Cones of Silence.
There are advantages to nudity.
It might eliminate war.
Without uniforms, no one will know who the enemy is.
We will know.
We can have uniforms made out of metal.
Aluminum is good.
It's light.
You can march in it. You can paint your medals on it.
Uniforms! Uniforms!
And stop already.
Where did your uniforms get us in the last war?
I would advise you not to talk to me like that.
You have relatives in Germany?
I can talk any way I like.
I got relatives in Chicago!
Gentlemen, trust me. I know what I'm talking about.
There is no such thing as a Nude Bomb.
There never has been a Nude Bomb and there never will be a Nude Bomb.
LARABEE:
How was the UN, Max?
MAXWELL: Very cooperative, Larabee.
It's a fine organization.
Max, I've been thinking about it.
And if they decide to drop the
Nude Bomb, I know the answer.
Well?
Well, what?
Don't you want to know the answer?
No!
Food.
Food?
Sure, the whole world will start wearing food.
Larabee, that is the stupidest thing
I have ever heard in my entire life.
The whole world will start wearing food?
I have heard you say some dumb things, Larabee, but that's got to be the dumbest thing
I have ever heard come out of your mouth!
People wearing food. Forget it, Larabee, just forget it!
Food! Jesus!
What kind of food?
Fruits, vegetables, fish, but not too much red meat.
You wear red meat a couple of times a week, that's plenty.
But this is crazy.
Why? We're just going back to the Bible.
Now what did Adam and Eve wear to cover up the good parts?
Fig leaves.
Now, that's fruit.
Now, you take a head of romaine lettuce.
That will clothe a family of six.
You buy a flank steak, you throw it over your shoulders and you got a stole.
Cantaloupe. You cut it in half, scoop out the inside and you got a bra.
What holds the bra up?
Linguini.
Linguini?
Larabee, that's insane.
Do you realize that the whole world is facing a food shortage as it is?
Max, this will work.
People for the first time will know where their next meal is coming from.
They'll be wearing it.
You'll wear it two or three times, then you eat it.
Won't it spoil?
Not if you're neat.
What has neatness got to do with it?
Well, you can't take your clothes off and throw them over a chair anymore.
You got to learn to fold them neatly and put them in the refrigerator.
MAXWELL: Larabee, you can just drop me off in front.
Why are we going in this way?
LARABEE: Wait till you see
Carruthers' invention, Max.
See you later, Max.
CARRUTHERS: Got our first break, Smart.
Man named Seigle responded to the distribution of the photographs.
Said he'd call you back.
(PHONE BUZZING) Don't tie up that stapler, Carruthers.
Seigle may call back any minute.
Carruthers here.
I'm leaving the stapler location.
I'll be at my piano number in half an hour.
If you need me earlier, call me on my jock strap, but please, just ring once.
All right, Smart, I'll explain this desk to you and then get the hell out of here.
That won't be necessary, Carruthers.
I've seen desks before.
Not like this one.
This is the latest in counterattack furniture.
The D-1 Turbocharger
Desk Mobile.
This desk can go from zero to 60 in five seconds and can cruise at 80 miles an hour.
It was built at a cost of $12 million.
Get on.
See that key in the drawer?
Turn it.
Of course. The old dashboard in the drawer trick.
To activate the armament, you press the knob marked "air-conditioning."
How do you turn on the air-conditioning?
There is no air-conditioning.
There is no air-conditioning?
Are you kidding?
$12 million for this thing and no air-conditioning?
You better work on that, Carruthers.
How much mileage do you get on this thing?
Thirty-five on the highway,
12 in the living room.
Well, that's not bad for an American make.
That's because it doesn't run on gasoline.
It runs on ink.
This thing runs on ink?
That's fantastic, Carruthers!
Why, do you realize that could be the answer to the fuel shortage?
I'm afraid not. Special kind of ink.
Comes from Saudi Arabia.
Well, Smart, that's it.
Make sure to change drawers every 6,000 miles.
Mine or the desk's?
That depends on who's chasing you.
CARRUTHERS:
I'm sure I'll see you later.
It's been that kind of day.
22, don't do that to me!
How did you get in here?
Through the wall.
Through the wall?
Well, what do you want?
Well, I've been doing a lot of thinking since we met, and I feel we got off on the wrong foot.
You know, things would run a lot smoother if we became friends.
Let's stop beating around the bush, 22.
What you're after is my body.
Well, just put it out of your mind because it won't work.
I don't know what you may have heard about me, but I am not easy.
Look, I think you've got this all wrong.
I'll be...
I know, I know.
You'll be gentle.
I've heard that one before.
Sure, and as soon as I relax, you'll be all over me.
And then when the case is over,
I'll never hear from you again.
Max!
So now it's Max! See?
That's what I was afraid of!
Look, 22, when I'm on a case, I don't fool around!
I mean, before a case, maybe!
After a case, definitely.
During a case, never!
Never?
Never!
Hmm?
After, definitely.
Freeze.
36, what are you doing in my bed?
Well, Carruthers called about Seigle.
I rushed right over and you weren't here, and I hadn't slept in 48 hours, so I thought I'd take a shower to wake myself up.
But it didn't work.
I'm sorry, Max, I guess I fell asleep on the job.
I suppose nothing like that's ever happened to you?
I'm going to change into my clothes.
Oh, Max, would you hand me the bra and panties on the chair?
AGENT 22: Max?
Excuse me, I just got instructions from Carruthers to activate the voiceprint monitoring system for the Seigle call on all the extensions.
What was that?
What was what?
Didn't the toilet just flush?
The toilet, yes.
Well, that's another one of Carruthers' inventions.
It's an automatic flusher.
You see, it flushes every hour on the hour whether you want it to or not.
It's also a clock.
Two flushes, that's two a flush. 2:00.
Well, time certainly flies when you're having fun, doesn't it?
Well, you should be running along,
22, it's getting kind of late.
What is that in your hand?
That? That's my bra.
Your bra?
Would you believe, my training bra?
Uh-uh.
22, I can explain this bra in five seconds.
These panties are gonna take a little longer.
It isn't necessary.
But it is necessary, 22.
You see, they're a disguise from a former mission.
Max, where are my bra and panties?
36, you know 22.
Mmm-hmm.
Now, wait a minute, 22,
I can explain anything.
I mean, I can explain everything!
I did not know that
36 was in my bedroom.
When I came into my bedroom, there was 36 lying on my bed in my bathrobe.
So, then when I came in, she was embarrassed, you see, so she went into the bathroom and she asked me to bring in her clothes.
So, that's when I went to get her clothes, her panties and her bra, see?
And I went to bring them in.
That's when you came in, she came out and that's the whole story in a nutshell.
Well, what do you think?
Bullshit!
Bullshit.
This is the last time I ever tell the truth to a woman.
Look, the next time you come over here, don't wear my bra and panties.
Your bra and panties, that's an order!
That could be Seigle.
Hello?
My name is Jonathan Levinson Seigle.
I own Jonathan of Paris, here in New York.
I have information which could determine the fate of the entire world and civilization as it is known today.
You got a minute?
Of course.
I received a photograph of that fellow that broadcasts for KAOS on television.
And suddenly I remembered.
Yes?
I had a model who worked for me.
Came in late one day, wearing a dress with the exact same pattern, a plum paisley.
Now, listen, this is very important, Mr. Seigle.
Can you put me in touch with this model?
Look, Mr. Smart, this is not a good time.
I've been waiting for a buyer.
And she's finally here.
Why don't you come by my place?
17117th Avenue, tonight, exactly 5:00.
Could be 5:15.
Mr. Seigle?
He's been shot, 22.
See what you can do for him.
I'm gonna check out the back.
Relax, relax.
Calm down, ladies.
You have nothing to fear from me.
I'm a government agent.
I advise you to keep this door shut and locked.
Whoever it was got away.
Is this Seigle?
Yes.
How is he?
I think he's dying.
I'll call an ambulance.
Mr. Seigle, did you see who did it?
It was a man.
It was a man who...
Too late.
Better call the morgue.
Just a second.
Ambulance.
He was a big man, a tall man.
I'd say a 42 long.
Did you notice anything else about him?
He had a patch over one eye.
Morgue.
What's your hurry?
Ambulance.
He also had one leg and one arm.
One leg and one arm? Why didn't you tell me that before?
You didn't ask me if he was hard to fit.
Morgue.
Just a few minutes.
Ambulance.
When you called me, you told me you had information about the Nude Bomber.
I think...
Who should I call?
Morgue?
Ambulance.
Get me a fair deal, Andy, with Ernest Ainsley.
Mr. Seigle, you've got to try to remember!
Now, you said that this model that worked for you, that wore a dress with the same paisley pattern as the man in the photograph.
Something was happening.
SEIGLE: What is this? The fucking Indianapolis 500? Hey!
MAXWELL: Mr. Seigle!
Mr. Seigle, say something!
Whiplash!
Watch where you're going, fellow.
Oh, Doctor, how is he?
Will he be all right?
I think so.
His vital signs are encouraging, but he's very weak.
We have to ask him some questions.
He can't talk.
Can he type?
I'm sorry, you can't go in there.
Doctor, it is absolutely vital that we speak to him.
This is an international emergency.
That man in there has information that could determine the fate of the entire world.
Well...
22, do you mind?
Let me handle this. I've dealt with doctors before.
Now, look, Doctor, we want in.
No!
Please?
Okay.
See?
Mr. Seigle.
We desperately need to know the name of the model who wore the dress.
Can you help us,
Mr. Seigle?
What did he say?
He asked me to take my hand out of his groin.
What did he say?
He wants you to put your hand in his groin.
Mr. Seigle, please, can you help us?
He's too weak to talk. He's humming the information to us.
That's Hello Dolly The model's name must be Dolly.
Mr. Seigle, Dolly, Dolly. This Dolly?
Where can we find this Dolly?
I know that tune.
I know it.
I know that tune.
Now, don't tell me, I know it.
California Here I Come
I told you I knew it.
She's somewhere in California.
Where in California,
Mr. Seigle?
In Hollywood.
(COUGHS) Los...
Los Angeles.
Mr. Seigle, you said you knew the name of the man who designed the paisley dress?
(SINGING) I wanna be
In that number
When the saints go marching in
Oh, when the saints
Go marching in
Oh, when the saints go marching in
AGENT 22:
Well, I want to be
Mr. Seigle?
Mr. Seigle?
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, but you're going to have to leave.
Doctor, you've got to give us a little more time.
I must ask him one more question!
We've got to find out what he meant by When the Saints Go Marching In
It's too late.
He's asleep.
Well, at least we have some information to feed into the computer.
We know about Dolly and we know about California.
Yes, and we also know that somehow
KAOS has advance information on every action we take.
Well, no matter how clever they may be, no one, not even KAOS can anticipate my every move.
Nothing on When the Saints Go
Marching In, but as for Dolly...
Do you have a make on her?
JERRY: Subject's full name is Dolly Francine Winston.
Address, 2211 Beach Avenue, Santa
Monica, California, 90402.
That's fantastic.
What does she do?
Interesting background.
She traveled with Isaac Stern as his accompanist on 20 concerts worldwide.
Prior to that, she was a curator, specializing in pre-Columbian restoration at the Pyramids of Teotihuacan.
And she voyaged with the Cousteau expedition as a consultant on bathyspheric pressure studies.
What is she doing now?
She's a tour guide at Universal Studios.
Well, she certainly has the background for it.
Well, thank you very much.
You've been very helpful.
Oh, just one more question, Doctor.
BOTH: Yes?
Are you sure this is the right Dolly Winston?
BOTH: Positive.
Why do you ask?
Well, I once knew a Dolly Winston, traveled with the Benny Goodman band.
She was a singer?
No, she just traveled with the band.
(DISPATCHER CHATTERING
ON RADIO)
What happened here?
Ask the landlady.
We're government agents.
What happened?
I didn't see that.
That doesn't look anything like you.
It's my thumbprint.
Okay.
Was that Dolly?
That was Dolly.
Dolly Winston?
Mmm-hmm.
What happened?
A man.
A man with a patch over his eye.
And one arm?
And a limb.
Of course, they knew we were coming again, but how?
He ripped the room apart.
He destroyed everything.
May we see the room?
It's $300 a month.
Of course, you realize it's a mess right now, but once we get it cleaned up,
I may have to charge my cleaning fee a little higher than usual.
But as a rule, we're very clean and the apartment is such a mess we...
LANDLADY: And the bathroom is just down the hall. You are so lucky.
The plum paisley dress isn't here.
The plum paisley, that was her favorite.
But she never kept it here.
She kept it in her locker at the studio, for when she went out on dates right from work.
We got here as soon as we could, 13.
Who you working with?
Agent 22 is my backup, right over here.
Hi, 13.
Oh, hi, 22.
Where's the locker room?
Oh, it's over there.
Women only. I better go get the dress.
I didn't know 22 was your backup.
She's really something, isn't she?
Yes, she's very nice.
I knew her when she was married to Agent 78.
22 was married to the late great 78?
Wasn't he a little old for her?
Well, let's see, 22 was 21 when she married 78 in '72.
78 was 46, that means 78 was
22, 32, 40... Twenty-five years older than 22.
22 joined PITS when 78 died in '75.
Tell me, 13, how was 78 killed?
Investigating the numbers racket.
AGENT 22: Max, help!
22, are you all right?
He clubbed me.
A man, he grabbed the dress and went out the door!
That way, 22.
MAN: Now, there are rules to movie fighting.
The villain always gets in the first punch.
I counter with a left, like in the stomach, toss him out the window.
And that's why movie fights look realer.
Now, we have a little gunplay after a fist fight.
There has to be a movie shootout!
They're using real bullets.
ROBOT: You have blundered into a Cylon battle zone
You are now our prisoners
Do not attempt to escape
Move forward immediately, or we will blast you
ROBOT: All stations stand by
Power beams on Stand by
Secure for space travel
ROBOT: Activate primary thrusters
Activate
Ignition sequence
All systems ready Stand by
GUIDE: Ladies and gentlemen, we're about to see a close-up of one of the most famous structures in motion picture history.
A house used in the Alfred
Hitchcock thriller, Psycho
We've got to take this tram.
There are people on it.
Tell them it's part of the tour.
They could get killed.
So what? We're not charging them for it.
MAXWELL:
This tram is overloaded.
Tell them they can walk on water, it's part of the tour.
AGENT 22: All right, now, you're all Israelites.
You're going to go into the water and experience what Moses did.
Everybody up!
One, two, three!
Max, duck!
Your damn vanity could have led Smart right to us!
Fairly empty accusation, considering it was you, my dear Nino, who gave the whole damned dress to your lady friend.
Smart has seen me.
He should be eliminated!
Yes, I'm afraid we'll have to kill him, if he gets too close.
We're getting close, 86.
PAM: Name?
Nino Salvatori Sebastiani.
Subject was victim of violent laboratory explosion, which occurred the afternoon of November 24th.
Wasn't that on Thanksgiving Day?
That's not important, Larabee.
Subject sustained the loss of one arm, one leg, one eye and one turkey.
Told you.
I think what Larabee is really trying to say is that the explosion in the laboratory took place while Nino was working on the Nude Bomb.
And Nino Salvatori Sebastiani could be the Nude Bomber himself.
Question is where do we find
Nino Salvatori Sebastiani within the next 36 hours?
This may help.
He was recently divorced from Edith Von Secondberg.
She's a reputable fashion designer currently vacationing in Innsbruck, Austria.
Well, that's good enough for me.
Okay, I'm off.
MAXWELL: Agent 34?
86, welcome to Innsbruck.
Thank you.
Shall we go?
MAXWELL: Fill me in on Edith Von Secondberg.
AGENT 34: She's a famous fashion designer, cherishes her seclusion.
However, she does like her men.
A bit of charm and you may get what you want.
Bit of charm, eh?
Well, I've used that weapon many times before.
If that's what it takes to get the information,
I may let her have her way.
And if necessary,
I'll go the limit.
Uh-oh.
Just our luck. We got to run into a poisonous Achtung
That means attention.
There has been an avalanche.
Well, what do we do now?
Oh, don't worry,
I'll get us out in a second.
Meanwhile, why don't you slip in your ski boots?
Carruthers has adapted them with your usual equipment.
AGENT 34:
Now, the road is blocked.
We have to do the rest of the way on skis.
You know how to ski, don't you?
I'm gonna try and forget you said that.
Slip into those bindings.
If you don't lock them in place correctly, they can be very difficult to get off, almost impossible.
They freeze shut.
All set?
MAXWELL: I'll be right behind you.
You're the boss, 86.
What took you so long?
Oh, boy, you are fast.
I couldn't even see you pass me.
Okay, 34, you better get out of sight.
Let me help you with your skis.
If it'll make you feel better.
The bindings are stuck. They're frozen.
Got a cigarette lighter?
34, listen. Someone's coming to the door.
Get out of sight.
Good luck, 86.
(SHUSHING) You mustn't knock.
No noise whatsoever or that will come down.
Won't you come in?
We can talk inside.
Wouldn't you prefer to leave your skis outside?
In this neighborhood?
Are you kidding?
You're quite witty.
And charming.
Who are you?
My name is Maxwell Smart.
I'm an insurance salesman of Mutual of Austria, and I have come here to sell you avalanche insurance.
Really?
I'm most interested.
Oh, I'm preparing some hot, buttered rum.
Would you like to join me?
No, thank you.
If you're chilled,
Mr. Smart, why don't you stand by the fire?
Oh, thank you.
There's something I think you should know, Maxwell.
And what is that?
Your skis are on fire.
Well, in that case, why don't
I just take them off and...
Let's see.
I'll just...
Just put them there until I'm ready to leave.
You are amusing.
I've tried for years to get avalanche insurance.
There is no such thing.
What is it you really want?
That's very perceptive of you, my dear.
The truth of the matter is that
I'm not really an insurance man.
I'm a secret agent.
And I'm here on a very important mission, Edith.
May I call you Edith?
I'd like that.
Particularly since that's my name.
You'll find I answer a lot faster to it than I would if you call me Marian.
I'm going to level with you, Marian.
May I call you Marian?
Edith.
I'm looking for your husband.
Do you know where I can find him?
I don't know.
I haven't seen him in years.
Were you married to him when he had his accident?
We were married, but...
Well, we weren't living together.
Things weren't working out.
Nino became almost schizoid at times.
Schizoid?
Yes.
Half scientist, half fashion designer.
He developed an insatiable desire to know everything about my work in design.
And then came Norman.
Norman?
I took an out-of-work scientist and made him a partner.
And what did it get me?
Permathin and Norman.
Who's Permathin?
It's a fabric.
Is that like a plum paisley?
It could be produced as plum paisley.
It could be plaid.
It could be plain.
In other words, it could be anything that starts with a "P," right?
Right. If you invested in it, it could make you poor.
It was prohibitive to produce.
And who is Norman?
Norman Saint Sauvage.
But I never did meet him.
Norman...
How do you spell that last name?
S-A-l-N-T.
That's Saint.
It's pronounced "San."
Of course.
Well, that's what Seigle was trying to tell us when he hummed When the
Saints Come Marching In
Norman Saint Sauvage.
AGENT 34: Open up, 86.
It's KAOS.
(SHUSHING) The avalanche.
Where are they?
They're on a snowmobile.
There's two of them.
KAOS knows every move I'm making.
There must be a double agent on our team.
We've got to get out of here.
Is there a back door?
Through the kitchen.
All right, you two stay here and I'll take care of them outside.
All right, nobody move.
All right, gentlemen, that's it.
This ridiculous little game is over with.
I advise you to drop your guns and put up your hands.
Why?
Because at this very minute, my friend, this chalet is being completely surrounded by 500 Alpine crack troops.
I find that hard to believe.
Would you believe 150
Tyrolean ski troopers?
No, we wouldn't.
How about two
St. Bernards in heat?
You all right?
Yeah.
This is Maxwell Smart
I'm sorry I can't speak to you at the moment
But at the sound of the beep, you'll leave your name, number and the approximate time you called
I shall return your call as soon as possible
I can't believe this.
What is it?
Something's goofy.
This morning we ran a profile on
Saint Sauvage and found nothing, and now suddenly, we've got something.
MAXWELL: I find that very difficult to believe.
Yesterday, nothing on Saint Sauvage, today, the computer has the whole story.
There's something very strange going on around here.
What happened, Doc?
Somebody screwed around with the computer.
JERRY: Or there's been an unprecedented malfunction, which led to an egregious miscalculation of...
Forget it!
I'll check out the circuitry.
"Norman Saint Sauvage, Boulder,
Colorado, age 43, height 6'2".
"Profession, fashion coordinator."
That certainly ties in with the design and textile business.
Sauvage lived in New
York in 1975 and '76.
Didn't Edith Von Secondberg say that that's where Sebastiani and Sauvage met?
MAXWELL: Yes.
LARABEE: Looks like
Sauvage is our man.
AGENT 22: I don't think we have any options, 86, we'll have to fly to Boulder.
86, don't you think it's advisable to take the whole PITS team?
If it turns out that Sauvage is the Nude Bomber, you're gonna need their expertise and skills.
Good idea, Chief.
Hi, Max.
Did you give it the once over? Twice.
Somebody had good reason for getting you on this plane.
Left you a little going-away present.
A going-away bomb.
It's set for 5,000 feet and bon voyage
Well, that clinches it.
Whoever doesn't show up for this flight is the double agent.
Who do you think that is?
MAN: Girls don't understand baseball.
I'll tell you at checkpoint seven.
Okay.
Well, who do you suspect?
Agent 36.
36? How do you figure?
It's really quite simple, 13.
She knew about Seigle, she knew about Dolly Winston and she knew about the Von Secondberg trip.
I'm sorry to say this, but
Agent 36 is the double agent.
Hi, I came early to set up my equipment.
On the other hand, it could be the Krovneys.
Those two innocent teenagers are vicious KAOS killers.
Hello, 36.
Pam, do you have the file diskettes load FCRTF?
It could be Carruthers.
86, it's Carruthers.
Are you gonna be in there long?
I'll be right out, Carruthers.
How about Larabee?
He knew every move you were about to make, too.
Max, come on out! Give Carruthers a break, it's an emergency.
Well, 13, that takes care of about everybody on board.
With one exception.
Yes, Agent 22.
I can't believe it.
I don't wanna believe it.
There's nothing else I can do.
She's the only one left, 13.
I like her.
Well, 13, there's no room for sentimentality in this business.
Oh, I'm sorry about that, 13.
AGENT 13: (GARGLING)
Oh, that's all right.
22 is not on board.
Well, I'll tell you why she's not on board.
It's something I've suspected for a long time.
What's the factual data, 86?
22 is...
Sorry, I'm late.
Always sorry she's late.
Boy, am I glad to see you, twenty...
Oh, there you are.
I'm glad to see you, 22.
Let's take off, Max.
No, Larabee, this flight is canceled.
Coming.
Hello.
AGENT 22: Hello, Max
Oh, it's you, 22, good.
Anything yet?
Well, we're working on it
Well, did you seal the airports and the Amtrak?
We worked around that, too Good.
Well, any news yet?
No.
I'm waiting word from the President.
Okay Well, you can call me here, 22.
From here on in, I'll be working out of the apartment.
Gotcha
CHIEF:
Not for long, Max.
I underestimated you, Max.
When did you first get suspicious?
It really wasn't that difficult to figure out.
You knew about Seigle, you knew about Dolly, and you knew about the Von Secondberg trip.
But the real clincher was when you sent me to fly the unfriendly skies of KAOS.
It's been nice working with you, 86.
Where would you like it?
How about Cincinnati?
Very funny.
Goodbye, Max!
MAXWELL: Watch out, Larabee, it's not the Chief.
May I see your license, please?
Now, look, Officer...
Is this your desk?
Yes, it is my desk.
Sixty miles an hour is pretty fast for a desk, isn't it?
It is?
Yep.
Look, Officer, I'm a government agent.
I'm after a defector.
MAN: Hey, man, where did you get your license?
Hey, you!
Don't let go, please!
I won't if you tell me where I can find Sebastiani and Saint Sauvage.
I don't know!
And I don't know how much longer I can hold onto you.
The Pocono Mountains.
Mount Thimble.
But don't tell them I told you.
They'll destroy me.
Don't worry, I won't tell them.
Can I have your word on that?
You've got...
Sorry about that, Chief.
NINO: The President has requested more time from the UN
They are going to give it to him
And that's dangerous for us.
Smart knows too much.
Why all this stupid waiting?
Let's drop the bombs!
That suits your purpose, but not mine.
Get it out of your head, once and for all.
We are not turning the world nude so you can dress them in your
Norman Saint Sauvage look.
I'm in this for money, not applause.
You're jealous of me.
Jealous?
Of you?
And you're beginning to exhaust my patience.
I am beginning to exhaust your patience?
Who do you think you are?
If it weren't for me, you wouldn't be sitting behind that desk.
You wouldn't exist!
Oh, but I do exist.
As for you, that's no longer true.
How long will it take you to have the bombs prepared for launching?
WOMAN:
All the bombs, sir?
Yes, all the bombs.
Countdown for total launch is two hours
Good.
Start your countdown procedures immediately.
We've landed totally undetected, thanks to my genius in creating the noiseless Shushcopter.
Look, there it is.
That's the second biggest zipper I ever saw.
It's unzipping.
Don't look, 22.
Why?
No telling what's liable to come out of that thing.
It's a magenta alert. We launch the bombs in 15 minutes.
15 minutes?
Carruthers, radio our position to PITS Central.
Tell them to send in the task force and to have them get here faster than possible.
All right, 22, we've got to invade that zipper before the mountain's fly closes.
Come on.
All right, all right, no need for any rough stuff!
It's the Chief!
How can that be?
When they pulled him from the manure truck, he had two broken legs!
He's in a Washington hospital under heavy guard.
22, there's something very strange going on around here.
Which way should we go?
I don't know, but we can't afford to get lost.
This place is full of labyrinths and they all look exactly alike.
You're right.
Of course I'm right.
Why, I once knew an agent who went into the Pentagon
Building in Washington and was lost for three days.
Three days? I can't believe anybody could get that confused.
Well, let me see.
I went in on a Tuesday and I came out on a Fri...
Max, I don't understand it.
If the Chief is working with Sauvage, then why is he a prisoner?
I don't know, 22, the whole thing is crazy, but there must be some explanation.
Indeed there is.
Please come in.
Well, thank you very much, but we were just leaving.
GUARD:
We'll take those guns.
You want to stay for a little while?
I don't care, it's up to you.
Please, come in, Mr. Smart, make yourself comfortable.
We're in trouble.
What'll we do?
Stall.
Sit down, please.
Thank you.
Well, this is certainly a very pleasant and unexpected surprise.
I'm sure there is a good reason why you have invaded my mountain.
Okay, let's hear it.
You're indeed an incredible man.
Here you are, completely in my power and yet you manage to keep your sense of humor.
All right, Sauvage, let's cut out all the small talk.
I'm here to make you a deal.
Give up this mad scheme, turn over the Nude Bombs to me, disband KAOS, make a public apology, and I will see to it personally that you are executed immediately to avoid a long stay in a dirty, filthy jail cell.
Well, that's my deal.
What do you say?
Well, what's your answer?
I'm waiting.
You won't have to wait too long, Mr. Smart.
In five minutes,
I will release the Nude Bomb and rid the Earth of all its unsightly, gauche fabric.
And then I, being the only source of clothing, become master of a shivering, groveling, naked mass of humanity!
Thereby gaining absolute control of every living man, woman and child on this Earth!
Well, that's a very pretty speech, Sauvage.
But it has one great flaw in it.
What's that?
Yeah, what's that?
Yes, well, I'm not quite sure, but if you would run through it one more time,
I think I could spot it.
You're a strange man,
Mr. Smart.
I'm strange?
Listen, fellow, anyone that runs around with panty hose over their head and tries to make the whole world nude, that's strange!
Let's face it, Sauvage, you're not playing with a full deck.
Your bogus ingenuousness is straining my equanimity.
Could you put that another way?
You're pissing me off.
Yes, well, there's no need to get hostile about it, Norman.
May I call you Norman?
No, you may not.
No, I may not.
Norm?
Mmm-mmm.
Normy?
Yes, well, perhaps you're right.
Familiarity does breed contempt.
Well, Mr. Saint Sauvage, sir, let's look at a couple of facts.
Let's.
Supposing you do get four billion shivering, groveling, bare-assed subjects.
A fashion plate like yourself would wanna design clothes for them so that it would reflect your own good taste.
Let's face it, my friend, good help nowadays is hard to find.
I've taken that into consideration.
Madame Rose?
There is my answer.
Madame Rose. The world's greatest seamstress.
She's going to make clothes for four billion people?
Boy, is she in for a lot of overtime.
Madame Rose, pass through the Clonatorium.
Instant cloning?
Yes.
When I need them, there will be a room full of Roses.
That's fantastic.
One goes in, two comes out.
I got to get one of those machines.
I wonder what they go for.
De-clone yourself.
Thank you, Madame Rose.
Now it's time for you to witness history in the making.
I'm going to set off the Nude Bomb and introduce to the world
Norman Saint Sauvage.
There is no Norman Saint Sauvage.
What?
This isn't Norman Saint Sauvage.
This is Nino Salvatori Sebastiani!
Release him.
Stand back.
You're very clever,
Mr. Smart.
And you are very careless.
You yourself gave me the answer.
Your vanity led you to demonstrate the cloning machine.
And then it came to me in a flash.
The Chief was captured, cloned, and returned to PITS as a double KAOS agent.
After that, it was fairly simple.
If Nino could clone the Chief, then he could clone himself, and that's exactly what he did.
And after cloning himself and creating you, Mr. Norman Saint Sauvage, that's when the explosion in the laboratory took place, leaving the original Sebastiani with a squint, a gimp and a limp.
Well, Mr. Norman Saint Sauvage,
I wouldn't be too smug, because to use the terms of your own trade, you're nothing but a knockoff, a cheap copy.
Where is the original Sebastiani?
(CHUCKLES) Dead.
You killed him!
I merely discarded an imperfect mold and preserved the product.
Its first and finest masterpiece.
Well, Mr. Smart, evidently
I underestimated you.
You're not a complete fool, after all.
Almost. Very close, but not complete.
Unfortunately, your luck has run out.
It's a pity that one so young and pretty must die.
Well, thank you, Sauvage, but I'm not afraid to die.
Max, I think he means me.
Oh!
The girl has a choice.
She may die with you or stay with me and join KAOS.
Well, what do you think, 22? Max!
There can only be one answer to a question like that.
There can only be one answer to a question like that, Sauvage!
What is that answer, 22?
Max, I'm staying with you.
That's the answer to a question like that.
Too bad.
If you'll excuse me for one minute,
I'm now going to fire my missiles.
MAN 1: Initiate all pre-launch programs.
WOMAN 1:
Prepare phase one.
MAN 2: All crew, ready areas.
Let's hustle it up, men.
WOMAN 2:
Code blue, code blue.
Prepare for launch.
Go to your underground shelters.
You stay here.
They're on their way,
Mr. Smart.
In four minutes, these missiles will reach their destination and strike the world nude.
Now, Mr. Smart,
I have one last delightful launch to perform.
Yours.
Sorry about that,
Normy.
Max!
22, are you all right?
My legs are numb.
Well, don't worry, 22.
I'll have you out of here in no time.
Put your arms around my neck.
Atta girl.
Jesus!
What are you doing, Max?
The Fireman's Carry.
22, where are you?
I'm over here.
Oh.
Max, I'm starting to get some feeling down there.
We've got no time for that, 22.
No, I mean my legs!
If I let you up, will you walk?
If you let me up, I will dance.
Chief! Are you all right, Chief?
I'm fine.
What about you two?
MAXWELL: We're okay.
How did you get loose?
Well, my guards deserted the mountain.
Where's Sauvage?
He got hung up.
Max, this mountain is gonna blow up any second!
MAXWELL: Let's go!
Mission's over, Max.
Listen, there may be some fallout from that Nude Bomb.
We better get out of here.
MAXWELL:
Don't be ridiculous, Chief.
There is no fallout from a Nude Bomb.
Fallout from a Nude...
WOMAN: (SINGING) You're always there when I need you
I can count on you all right
If the world would end
I'd just call you
And you'd fix it overnight
If I wanted the sun I bet you
Would deliver it to me
You're always there when I need you
And I need you constantly
These are dangerous days we're living in
And many times I feel like giving in
But I never, never do
Instead, I turn to you
You're too smart to be true
You're always there when I need you
Heaven must have sent you here
It's a miracle somehow
You make disasters disappear
You make everything I'm feeling
There is nothing you won't try
You're always there when I need you
And I'll need you till I die
I'm gonna need you, baby
You're always there when I need you
I can count on you all right
If the world would end
I'd just call you
And you'd fix it overnight
If you wanted the sun I bet you
Would deliver it to me
You're always there when I need you
And I need you constantly
Don't you know I need you, baby
CHORUS: Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm gonna need you, baby
Gonna need you, baby
{{{ the end }}}
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
LIONS GATE ENTERTAINMENT
HELLO.
I WASN'T SURE
YOU'D COME.
I ALMOST DIDN'T,
AND THEN I GOT LOST,
ALL TURNED AROUND.
NOTHING LOOKED THE SAME.
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOMETHING TO DRINK?
MAYBE THAT
WOULD BE GOOD.
SOME WHITE WINE?
UH. I'M OUT OF WHITE WINE
RIGHT NOW.
I'VE HAD ENOUGH
TO DRINK ALREADY.
MAYBE TOO MUCH.
HOW DID YOU GET AWAY?
MY SISTER'S
HAVING PROBLEMS
WITH HER HUSBAND.
I TOLD COLLIN
SHE NEEDED TO SEE ME.
AT THIS HOUR?
IT'S A CRISIS.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
"THANKS FOR THE PARTY."
COLLIN WON'T MISS ME.
HE'S YOUR HUSBAND.
I JUST WORK FOR HIM.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO SAY.
I DON'T EITHER.
I'VE NEVER...
I KNOW.
WHY DID YOU...
WHY ARE YOU...
BECAUSE YOU WANT ME TO.
AND HAVE WANTED ME
FOR A LONG TIME.
I WAS SO OBVIOUS?
I COULDN'T IGNORE IT.
AND I GUESS I'M TO THE POINT
WHERE I NEED
TO BE WANTED LIKE THAT.
COLLIN...
OH, DON'T TELL ME
COLLIN KNEW, TOO?
IF COLLIN KNEW...
YOU KNOW HIM.
WHAT DO YOU THINK COLLIN
WOULD DO IF HE KNEW?
I DON'T KNOW.
MMM.
MMM.
I CAN'T MOVE.
THANK GOD.
HA HA!
BUT I HAVE TO.
EXCUSE ME. I'LL
BE RIGHT BACK.
WHEW.
Woman:
AAH! AAH!
AAH! AAH!
TERRY!
UHH!
AAH!
TERRY!
WHAT?
HELP ME!
HELP!
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT HAPPENED?
HE WAS TRYING TO KILL HER.
WHO WAS?
HEY, YOU.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
HE'S GONE NOW.
HE HAD HER FROM BEHIND.
HE WAS DRAGGING HER
TOWARD THE STREET.
THERE YOU GO.
TAKE MY ARM.
LOOKS LIKE
SHE'S ALL RIGHT.
COME ON, COME ON.
HEY,
THEY CAN SEE YOU.
HE WAS TRYING
TO KILL HER.
TO REALIZE IT WAS
REALLY HAPPENING.
DID YOU SEE HIM?
YES. HIS FACE WAS SO WHITE.
OH.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
I'VE GOT TO
GET OUT OF HERE.
I'LL WALK YOU
TO YOUR CAR.
20, 24... WITH
UNBELIEVABLE WHITE SKIN
AND RED HAIR COMBED
BACK LIKE A DUCK.
A DUCK TAIL.
YES.
THAT COULD'VE BEEN ME
DOWN THERE.
YOU MAY HAVE
SAVED MY LIFE.
THE PLEASURE WAS MINE.
IN FACT,
LET ME GO FURTHER.
IF I CAN BE
OF SERVICE AGAIN...
OH, DON'T.
I CAN'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT THAT NOW.
I'M SCARED AND LATER
THAN I SHOULD BE,
AND THAT COULD BE
TROUBLE FOR US BOTH.
ANY REGRETS?
NOT ONE.
IN SPITE
OF WHAT HAPPENED,
MAYBE BECAUSE OF IT,
IT'S THE MOST
EXCITING NIGHT
I CAN REMEMBER.
YOU?
REGRETS?
ARE YOU KIDDING?
ALL RIGHT!
HA HA HA HA!
ROUGH NIGHT LAST NIGHT?
YOU'RE LATE.
THOUGHT MAYBE YOU SLEPT IN.
HE'S BEEN ASKING FOR YOU.
COLLIN?
GOOD LUCK.
I WANT THE CONCRETE
ON THE SITE.
IF I GET THERE
AND FIND MY BOYS
SITTING AROUND
PULLING THEIR PUDS...
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU
LAST NIGHT?
WELL, SEE TO IT
THAT YOU DO.
EVERY LAST YARD
OF IT.
PARTY. WHERE DID
YOU DISAPPEAR TO?
OH, NOWHERE. I WENT HOME.
AND THE NEXT THING
I KNEW YOU WERE GONE.
WHAT'S THAT?
IT'S A BEAUTY, ISN'T IT?
BELONGED
TO BUGSY SEGAL.
40 YEARS OLD,
NEVER BEEN REGISTERED.
WHERE DID YOU GET IT?
A FRIEND.
GOT IT FROM A FRIEND.
HOLD IT.
FEELS GOOD,
DOESN'T IT?
THE WAY IT FITS
IN YOUR HAND.
ALMOST MAKES YOU WISH YOU
HAD A REASON TO FIRE IT.
EXCUSE ME. YOUR PAPER.
AHEM. THANK YOU.
Hi, TERRY.
Hi, LILLA.
WELL, THE MARKET'S
LOOKING UP.
HOW ARE THINGS COMING
ON THE WOOTON PROJECT?
HELLO?
IN FACT, I'D BETTER
GET BACK TO IT RIGHT NOW.
MAY I?
BE MY GUEST.
WHAT'S
SO INTERESTING?
LOOKS LIKE THE MIDEAST
IS HEATING UP AGAIN.
WELL, YOU SEE, THAT'S WHY
I NEVER READ THE NEWS.
RIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT IT...
THE GIRL IN THE NEWS?
A FEW BLOCKS AWAY,
LESS THAN
HALF AN HOUR LATER.
I THINK
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
NOT THE SAME GIRL, THOUGH.
MM-MMM.
YOU SAID THE ONE
YOU SAW HAD BROWN HAIR.
MMM. GOD, IT'S SCARY.
DID THE PAPER SAY ANYTHING
ELSE ABOUT WITNESSES?
SAID THERE WEREN'T ANY.
MMM.
TERRY,
IF IT WAS THE SAME MAN
AND NO ONE ELSE SAW HIM,
I SHOULD GO FORWARD,
GIVE THE POLICE
A DESCRIPTION.
MM-HMM.
YOU COULD ASK THEM
TO KEEP
YOUR IDENTITY A SECRET.
WHAT IF THEY WOULDN'T?
IT WILL ALL COME OUT.
WHAT ABOUT A LETTER?
NO, THEY WOULDN'T PAY
MUCH ATTENTION TO IT.
THEY WOULD THINK
IT WAS FROM SOME CRANK.
OH, JESUS, TERRY,
I WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING.
WHY SHOULD MY LIFE
BE TURNED UPSIDE-DOWN
JUST BECAUSE I HAPPENED
TO LOOK OUT OF A WINDOW?
IT'S NOT FAIR.
MM-MMM.
AM I TERRIBLE?
NO.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
POLICE DEPARTMENT, PLEASE.
AAH! TERRY!
I'LL TELL THEM
WHAT YOU SAW,
ONLY I'LL TELL THEM
THAT I SAW IT.
WHY SHOULDN'T I HAVE BEEN
THE ONE LOOKING OUT OF IT?
HELLO? YES. I WITNESSED
AN ASSAULT LAST NIGHT... Okay.
THEY'LL PROBABLY MAKE
A HERO OUT OF ME.
BUT YOU'LL BE LYING.
HELLO?
AND I THOUGHT I'D BETTER
CALL UP ABOUT IT.
RIGHT OUTSIDE MY APARTMENT
NEAR THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT.
12 EAST MOUNT VERNON PLACE.
TERRY LAMBERT.
SURE.
THAT'S THE MOST
ROMANTIC THING
I'VE EVER SEEN
IN MY LIFE.
YOU DID THAT FOR ME.
YOU REMEMBER
WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE?
MM-HMM. TELL ME WHAT
HE LOOKED LIKE.
TALL, RED HAIR.
MM-HMM. YES,
COMBED BACK
BEHIND THE EARS
LIKE THIS.
MM-HMM.
WHAT WAS HE WEARING?
UH, TAN JACKET
AND BLUE JEANS,
TENNIS SHOES.
WHEN YOU SAY TENNIS SHOES,
YOU MEAN TENNIS SHOES
OR RUNNING SHOES?
I MEAN TENNIS SHOES.
AND I'M GOING TO
MAKE LOVE TO YOU
LIKE NOBODY
EVER HAS BEFORE.
BUT I'M NOT SURE
WE'LL HAVE TIME
BEFORE THEY GET HERE.
GET HERE? TERRY!
MM-HMM.
SOME DETECTIVE. HE SOUNDED
VERY EXCITED, ACTUALLY.
OH, MY GOD.
HA HA HA.
TERRY, YOU'RE
GONNA PAY FOR THIS.
NO, YOU'D BETTER NOT.
COLLIN MIGHT BE HOME.
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF
THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT
IN AN HOUR.
I'M DETECTIVE QUIRKE, AND
THIS IS DETECTIVE JESSUP.
MAY WE COME IN?
YEAH, SURE.
I'M SORRY.
NICE APARTMENT. I LIKE
THESE OLD BUILDINGS.
MM-HMM.
YOU LIVE HERE
ALONE?
YES.
WHY?
DETECTIVE JESSUP
WILL TAKE NOTES,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.
WHAT HAPPENED, WHAT YOU
WERE DOING, WHAT YOU SAW.
WELL, I'D BEEN TO A PARTY,
KIND OF AN OFFICE PARTY...
OFFICE?
WENTWORTH CONSTRUCTION.
COLLIN WENTWORTH?
YOU WORK FOR HIM?
YEAH. ANYWAY,
WE JUST CLOSED A BIG ACCOUNT,
AND WE WERE HAVING A PARTY
TO CELEBRATE.
I CAME HOME EARLY
AND WENT TO BED.
AROUND 10:00.
THEN LATER, AT 2:15...
I REMEMBER,
'CAUSE I LOOKED AT THE CLOCK...
I HEARD A SCREAM,
NOT VERY LOUD,
BUT I COULD TELL
IT CAME FROM THE PARK.
I JUMPED UP
AND I WENT TO THE WINDOW.
WHICH WINDOW?
THE BEDROOM WINDOW.
MAY WE SEE IT?
MM-HMM.
WERE THE DRAPES OPEN?
YES.
AND WHAT DID YOU SEE?
RIGHT DOWN THERE.
HE HAD HER FROM BEHIND
AND WAS SORT OF DRAGGING HER
TOWARD THE STREET.
UH, SHE WAS STRUGGLING.
AND THEN HE THREW HER DOWN
AND THAT'S WHEN SHE SCREAMED
REAL LOUD, "HELP! HELP ME!"
AND THEN HE RAN AWAY.
WHY DIDN'T YOU
CALL THE POLICE?
I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS THAT IMPORTANT,
UNTIL I READ ABOUT THAT OTHER
GIRL THAT WAS MURDERED.
WHAT MADE YOU THINK
THERE WAS A CONNECTION?
A FEW BLOCKS AWAY,
HALF HOUR LATER.
NO, MR. LAMBERT, WE THINK
THERE'S A CONNECTION, TOO.
AND WE'RE VERY GLAD
YOU CAME FORWARD.
CIGARETTE?
NO, DON'T SMOKE.
GOOD FOR YOU.
DO YOU MIND?
DID YOU GET A GOOD LOOK
AT THE ASSAILANT?
YES.
DESCRIBE HIM, PLEASE.
YOUNG, EARLY 20s, 6-FOOT.
ANY DISTINGUISHING MARKS
OR CHARACTERISTICS?
RED HAIR, RED HAIR,
COMBED BACK BEHIND THE EARS
IN A DUCK TAIL.
TAN JACKET, BLUE JEANS,
TENNIS SHOES.
TENNIS SHOES
OR RUNNING SHOES?
TENNIS SHOES.
WHEN YOU SAY
TAN JACKET,
DO YOU MEAN A SPORTS COAT
OR A WINDBREAKER?
WINDBREAKER.
YOU HAVE A GOOD EYE
FOR DETAIL, MR. LAMBERT.
HE PROBABLY CAME
FROM BEHIND THAT TREE.
THE GIRL SAYS
THE SIDEWALK WAS DESERTED,
THAT HE CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.
SHE BARELY SAW HIM AT ALL.
BY THE WAY,
DO YOU KNOW HER?
THE GIRL. SHE LIVES
AROUND THE CORNER.
AHEM! NO.
SHE'S A LUCKY ONE.
THE OTHER GIRL WAS RAPED,
BEATEN TO DEATH, AND DUMPED.
YOU SAID HE WAS DRAGGING HER
TOWARD THE STREET,
AND HE WAS TRYING TO GET HER
TO HIS VEHICLE.
SHE'S A LUCKY ONE,
ALL RIGHT.
MR. LAMBERT, YOU SAID YOU
CAME BACK FROM THE PARTY,
WENT RIGHT TO BED?
THAT'S RIGHT.
WERE YOU ALONE?
YES. DIDN'T I SAY THAT?
NOT EXACTLY.
I WAS ALONE.
THAT'S WHY
HE WENT TO SLEEP, DAVE.
JUST WANTED
TO MAKE SURE.
AAH!
DID YOU MEAN WINDBREAKER
OR SPORTS COAT?
WINDBREAKER. WHY?
I WAS SO NERVOUS.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.
THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT TO SEE.
THAT'S WHERE SHE LIVED,
THE GIRL THAT WAS KILLED.
COME ON, I'LL SHOW YOU.
THIS ONE WAS ATTACKED
ON HER WAY HOME, TOO.
BUT IF IT HAPPENED
SO SOON AFTER,
HOW DID HE PLAN IT?
HOW DID HE KNOW
WHERE SHE LIVED?
I SUPPOSE HE CAME
DRIVING DOWN THIS STREET.
YOU KNOW, HE'S...
HE'S ANGRY.
EXCUSE ME, PLEASE.
Okay.
HE'S FRUSTRATED
AFTER HIS ABORTED ATTEMPT
OUTSIDE OF MY PLACE.
HE STOPS AT THAT STOP SIGN
RIGHT THERE.
LOOKING OVER, HE SEES A CAR
PARKED IN THE RED
IN FRONT OF THIS BUILDING.
HE SEES A GIRL LOCKED
IN THE ARMS OF HER LOVER,
HAVING A LAST
GOOD NIGHT KISS.
ON IMPULSE,
THE KILLER BACKS UP.
HE SEES THE SIDE DOOR
OF THE BUILDING,
HE PARKS,
AND RETURNS ON FOOT.
HE'S GUESSED THAT THE GIRL
LIVES IN THE BUILDING.
THAT SOON
SHE'LL BE GOING INSIDE.
HE RUNS UP THE STEPS
TO THE FRONT DOOR,
WHERE HE DOES SOMETHING
TO THE LOCK
SOMETHING THAT'LL PREVENT
THE KEY FROM OPENING IT.
AND HE SLIPS BACK DOWN
THE STEPS TO THE SIDE DOOR
TO WATCH AND TO WAIT.
THE GIRL GETS OUT
OF THE CAR,
WAVES GOOD-BYE,
GOES UP THE STEPS.
SHE TRIES TO OPEN THE DOOR,
BUT SHE CAN'T.
SHE TURNS
TO CALL AFTER HER LOVER,
BUT HE'S ALREADY
SPEEDING AWAY.
SO SHE DECIDES TO GO AROUND
TO THE SIDE DOOR.
THE POLICE TOLD YOU
ALL THAT...
ABOUT THE GIRL?
MOST OF IT. THE REST
WAS IN THE PAPER.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU HELPING ME DO
THE RIGHT THING,
GIVING THE POLICE
THE DESCRIPTION.
LET'S HOPE IT'S
OF SOME USE TO THEM.
WHEN WILL
I SEE YOU AGAIN?
SOON. VERY SOON.
THERE YOU GO.
HEY, WHAT'S IN THE BAG?
A LITTLE
LUNCH TIME SHOPPING?
UH, JUST SOME
WHITE WINE.
HAVE YOU BEEN
UP TO SOMETHING
YOU SHOULDN'T,
OLD BOY?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
COP WAS HERE
TO SEE YOU.
DETECTIVE
JESSUP.
HE WANTS YOU TO CALL
HIM AT THAT NUMBER.
THANKS, COLLIN.
WELL, WHAT'S IT
ALL ABOUT?
NOTHING MUCH.
A FEW NIGHTS AGO,
I WITNESSED AN ASSAULT
ON THIS GIRL.
SOUNDS INTERESTING.
NOT A RAPE, COLLIN,
MORE OF A MUGGING.
NO BIG DEAL.
WHICH NIGHT?
WHICH NIGHT?
YEAH,
WHICH NIGHT WAS IT?
THURSDAY NIGHT.
THAT WAS THE NIGHT
OF THE PARTY.
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
WELL?
AREN'T YOU GOING
TO CALL 'EM?
YES,
I'M GOING TO CALL 'EM.
IT'S TERRY LAMBERT,
DETECTIVE JESSUP.
CERTAINLY. 7:00?
THAT WILL BE FINE.
PROBABLY GO OVER
MY STATEMENT AGAIN.
YOU KNOW THE POLICE.
FRANKLY, I'M SURPRISED
TO SEE YOU GET SO INVOLVED.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD SUCH A
STRONG SENSE OF CIVIC DUTY.
HEY!
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU APPRECIATED
FRENCH WINE, EITHER.
I'M DEVELOPING
A TASTE FOR IT.
JUST TELL ME
WHAT YOU WANT.
YEAH, Okay.
JUST A SEC. YES?
I'M HERE TO SEE
DETECTIVE JESSUP.
THEY'RE RUNNING
LATE.
IF YOU HAVE A SEAT,
THEY'LL HAVE IT
SET UP
IN A FEW MINUTES.
YEAH. BURGLARY.
UH-HUH.
NO. OF COURSE.
YES, THANKS.
ALL RIGHT, HOLD ON.
LATE SETTING WHAT UP?
YOU SAID THEY WERE RUNNING
LATE SETTING SOMETHING UP.
YOU'RE HERE FOR
THE LINE-UP, AREN'T YOU?
THE LINE-UP?
YES.
NO, I THINK I WAS SUPPOSED
TO JUST COME DOWN...
YOU MUST BE THE ONE.
I MEAN, THEY TOLD ME
THERE WAS A WITNESS.
YES.
SORRY TO KEEP YOU
WAITING.
OH, Hi.
OF COURSE,
YOU TWO MUST HAVE
BUT I'LL HAVE TO ASK YOU
TO REFRAIN FROM DOING SO
DURING THE PROCEEDINGS.
RIGHT THIS WAY.
NOW THERE ARE 6 MEN
I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT.
DON'T WORRY. THEY WON'T
BE ABLE TO SEE YOU.
I DON'T WANT TO
DISAPPOINT YOU,
BECAUSE SOMETIMES PEOPLE
SEE MORE THAN THEY REALIZE.
BUT MR. LAMBERT HERE,
HE GOT A GOOD LOOK
AT THE MAN.
YOU DID?
WELL, I, UH...
Jessup: STEP RIGHT UP,
GENTLEMEN. DON'T BE SHY.
THAT'S RIGHT.
ALL THE WAY TO THE END.
TAKE YOUR TIME.
LOOK AT EACH ONE...
VERY CAREFULLY.
FACE LEFT, GENTLEMEN,
PLEASE.
BUT YOU DID GET A GOOD
LOOK AT HIM THAT NIGHT.
GOOD ENOUGH
TO GIVE US
THAT DETAILED
DESCRIPTION.
BUT SEEING THEM ALL TOGETHER
LIKE THIS,
I JUST CAN'T BE SURE.
BUT SURELY IF YOU
WERE TO COME
FACE-TO-FACE
WITH THE MAN
YOU DESCRIBED
IN SUCH DETAIL,
YOU'D RECOGNIZE HIM,
WOULDN'T YOU?
YES, I THINK SO.
THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES.
YOUR HUNCH WAS WRONG.
ONE OF THE MEN
YOU SAW TONIGHT
HAS DONE THIS KIND
OF THING BEFORE.
THAT, COMBINED WITH
YOUR DESCRIPTION...
WELL, OBVIOUSLY
I WAS WRONG.
WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO KEEP LOOKING.
SORRY.
I'M SORRY
YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HIM.
YEAH, ME, TOO.
I'VE SEEN YOU BEFORE...
AT EDGAR'S.
I DON'T THINK...
I COCKTAIL THERE.
IT'S NOT MY NIGHT
FOR RECOGNIZING PEOPLE.
I WAS WALKING HOME FROM WORK
THE NIGHT IT HAPPENED.
I DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE.
THERE'S A LOT I DON'T DO.
CAN'T DO
TILL I KNOW WHO HE IS.
THEY SEEM PRETTY SURE
THAT THE SAME GUY
ATTACKED
THAT OTHER GIRL.
ONLY SHE'S DEAD,
AND I'M ALIVE.
I SHOULD FEEL LUCKY,
I GUESS.
DO YOU THINK
THEY'LL CATCH HIM?
I HOPE SO.
WELL, GOOD NIGHT.
HE'S NOT EVEN
TELLING HER ABOUT IT.
YOU'LL SEE WHEN
HE TAKES HIS HOOD OFF.
WHAT IF IT IS HIM?
WHAT DO WE DO?
FIRST, YOU'LL HAVE TO
TELL ME WHETHER IT IS.
TERRY, THERE MUST BE
HUNDREDS OF YOUNG MEN
IN BALTIMORE WITH RED HAIR.
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU THINK...
THERE! LOOK.
Man: YOU CAN'T
WELD IT DOWN HERE.
I WANT YOU TO HAVE
A BETTER LOOK.
THAT'S HIM, ISN'T IT?
COME ON, SYLVIA.
HE'S JUST WHAT YOU SAID,
THE HAIR, THE SIZE,
EVERYTHING.
EVEN THE WHITE SKIN.
I CAN'T SAY.
NOT FOR SURE.
WHY NOT?
I JUST CAN'T.
BUT IT MIGHT
BE HIM.
IT MIGHT BE.
BUT WHAT GOOD
DOES THAT DO?
WHAT GOOD DOES ANY OF IT DO?
I COULDN'T
GO FORWARD BEFORE.
IT WOULD BE WORSE NOW.
IF HE DID WHAT HE DID
TO THOSE GIRLS
BUT WE DON'T KNOW IT, TERRY.
I AM NOT SURE.
THAT DETECTIVE QUIRKE...
HE SAID THAT ONE OF
THE MEN IN THE LINE-UP
WAS THERE BECAUSE
HE HAD RAPED BEFORE.
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
THIS IS THE ONE
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT.
I'M SORRY, TERRY.
I KNOW
YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED,
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO ABOUT IT.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
LET'S NOT SPEND OUR TIME
DRIVING AROUND, Okay?
Okay.
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING
FROM THE BAR?
UH, YEAH. A BEER.
DRAFT?
YEAH.
HEY.
OH.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
WHOA!
YEAH! WHOO!
WHOO! WHOO! WHOO!
GOOD LORD, HAVE MERCY.
Men:
TABLE! TABLE!
Men, chanting:
TABLE! TABLE! TABLE!
TABLE! TABLE! TABLE!
Man: YEAH!
NO KEEP GOING!
GO AROUND!
AND ME,
MAKING A FOOL OF MYSELF.
HERE, WATCH THIS.
READY FOR ANOTHER?
NO, THANKS.
OH! OH, MY GOD! OH!
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
NO, REALLY.
LET ME BUY YOU
A DRINK.
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.
IT'LL MAKE ME
FEEL BETTER.
Okay, Okay.
IT'LL MAKE ME
FEEL BETTER.
♪ TAKE ME IN YOUR ARMS
AND MAKE LOVE TO ME ♪
DON'T WANT TO WAKE THEM.
NO SUCH LUCK.
CHRIS, IS THAT YOU?
YOU COME UP HERE!
I'M TIRED OF YOU
BEING OUT
TILL ALL HOURS
OF THE NIGHT!
I TOLD YOU TO BE IN THIS
HOUSE BEFORE MIDNIGHT!
IF THIS EVER
HAPPENS AGAIN,
YOU'RE PACKING YOUR
THINGS AND LEAVING!
I MEAN IT!
GO ON DOWN!
YOU BE QUIET ABOUT
IT DOWN THERE!
THAT'S IT.
GET HER OUT OF HERE.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
THEY FOUND HER BODY STUFFED
IN THERE ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.
ANY IDEA WHO SHE IS?
NAH.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
INTERESTING.
HERE'S PETERS.
IS THIS
WHAT TIME
DON'T START, HUH?
I HEAR YOU GOT SOMETHING.
PETERS. STATE'S ATTORNEY'S OFFICE.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE
TOLD QUITE A STORY.
I'D LIKE TO ASK
SOME QUESTIONS.
WHY DIDN'T YOU IDENTIFY
HENDERSON AT THE LINE-UP?
HENDERSON?
THAT'S HIM...
CHRIS HENDERSON.
I DIDN'T WANNA MAKE
A MISTAKE.
AT NIGHT, TO SEE HIM
UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES.
UNUSUALLY
CONSCIENTIOUS.
AT NIGHT YOU
BECAME POSITIVE
HE ATTACKED MISS CONNELLY? YES.
YOU STILL DIDN'T IDENTIFY HIM.
YOU WAITED...
2 DAYS.
WHY?
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU THINK? HAVE WE
ENOUGH FOR A SEARCH WARRANT?
WITH LAMBERT'S POSITIVE
I.D., HENDERSON'S RECORD.
CAN I TIE HENDERSON
TO THE DEAD GIRLS?
SHE WAS IN A BAR
LAST NIGHT.
I'LL SEE IF ANYONE THERE
RECOGNIZES HIS PICTURE.
I CAN PROBABLY GET THE
WARRANT WITHOUT IT,
THANKS, MR. LAMBERT.
YOU'VE BEEN A BIG HELP.
I ONLY WISH
I HAD HELPED SOONER.
EVEN IF YOU'D IDENTIFIED
HENDERSON EARLIER,
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE
ARRESTED HIM.
HE'D OF STILL BEEN OUT ON
THE STREET LAST NIGHT.
OUR CONCERN ISN'T
THE ASSAULT ITSELF...
EXCEPT AS IT HELPS
TO BUILD A MURDER CASE.
AND THANKS TO YOU,
IT'S HELPING.
MAYBE WE'LL TIE HENDERSON
TO THE DEAD GIRLS.
IF WE DO,
WE'RE OFF AND RUNNING.
DON'T TORTURE YOURSELF
ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN.
WHAT YOU DID WAS RIGHT,
THERE'S NO DOUBT.
I JUST WISH YOU
HADN'T HAD TO DO IT.
HE COULD COME BACK
AND HURT US.
MY STATEMENT'S ONLY A TOOL
FOR THEIR SEARCH WARRANT.
BEYOND THAT, THEY
DON'T CARE ABOUT ME
YOU DIDN'T TELL THEM YOU
FOLLOWED HIM TO THE BAR?
EITHER I RECOGNIZED HIM
AT NIGHT OR I DIDN'T.
I HAD NO REASON
TO FOLLOW HIM.
SUPPOSE THEY DISCOVER
YOU LIED?
THEY DON'T CARE
ABOUT ME.
I PROMISE I WON'T LET
THEM FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.
HELLO?
OH, HOW ARE YOU,
DETECTIVE QUIRKE?
I SEE.
THANKS FOR
LETTING ME KNOW.
GOOD LUCK TO YOU.
WHAT? WHAT DID HE WANT?
THEY GOT
THE SEARCH WARRANT.
ISN'T THAT
WHAT YOU WANTED?
I GUESS SO, BUT...
NOBODY AT THE BAR
REMEMBERED HENDERSON.
BUT THEY'VE GOT
THE WARRANT ANYWAY?
YEAH. MY STATEMENT WAS ENOUGH.
THAT'LL BE
THE END OF IT.
TO CONNECT HIM TO THE
MURDERS OR THEY WON'T.
THEY'RE DONE
WITH ME.
THE SEARCH WAS SOMEWHAT
DISAPPOINTING.
NO FINGERPRINTS, NO BLOOD
SAMPLES, NO CLOTHING.
NOTHING TO PROVE HENDERSON
EVER CAME IN CONTACT
SOME COTTON FIBERS MATCH
THE SWEATER OF ONE GIRL,
BUT IT'S COMMON FIBER.
WE FOUND SOME
PEPPERMINT-FLAVORED TOOTHPICKS
IN THE TRUCK'S
GLOVE COMPARTMENT.
EACH GIRL WAS PREVENTED
FROM ENTERING HER RESIDENCE
BY A TOOTHPICK
JAMMED INTO THE KEYHOLE
AND THEN BROKEN OFF
THE NEWSPAPERS MENTIONED
JAMMED LOCKS.
WE HELD BACK
ABOUT THE TOOTHPICKS.
SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW?
I'LL LET PETERS EXPLAIN.
JESUS, THAT HOLDEN'S
A BREAKING JUDGE.
HAVE YOU FILLED HIM IN?
I WAS JUST
STARTING TO.
WE GOT A MURDER CASE
WE CAN'T WIN,
SOME INSIGNIFICANT
COTTON FIBERS,
SOME TOOTHPICKS
ANYONE COULD POSSESS.
MY ASSISTANT
LEARNED THAT BRAND
IS GIVEN AWAY IN LOTS OF
BALTIMORE RESTAURANTS.
SO HE DIDN'T DO IT?
HE COULD HAVE
RAPED THE GIRLS,
HAMMERED THEM TO DEATH
WITH HIS FIST.
HE COULD HAVE THROWN AWAY
THE GLOVES HE WORE,
ANY ARTICLES OF CLOTHING
WITH BLOOD ON THEM.
A CAR WASH WOULD HAVE
CLEANED HIS TRUCK. WHEW!
WHAT I'M SAYING IS
WE CAN'T PROVE
THAT HE DID IT.
SO DETECTIVE QUIRKE AND I
HAVE AGREED
TO GO WITH
THE ASSAULT CASE.
WE PROSECUTE HENDERSON
ON THE ASSAULT CASE.
WE CAN WIN THAT.
IT'S OPEN AND SHUT.
WE GOT A WITNESS WHO
SAW HIM DO IT... YOU.
YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T CARE
ABOUT THE ASSAULT.
I DON'T IF THERE'S
A CHANCE FOR MURDER,
BUT WE'RE UP AGAINST IT.
WE AREN'T GIVING UP
ON THE MURDER CASES.
WE MIGHT GET LUCKY
WHEN HE'S IN PRISON.
YOU MEAN SOMEONE
MAY KILL HIM?
I DOUBT THAT LUCKY.
I MEANT HENDERSON MIGHT
SHOOT OFF HIS MOUTH
TO SOMEBODY WHO WANTS
TO MAKE A DEAL.
MEANWHILE, HE DOESN'T
HURT ANYONE.
HOW ABOUT BEING
A STAR WITNESS?
I...
THIS ISN'T WHAT
I THOUGHT WOULD HAPPEN.
DON'T WORRY.
IT'LL BE A BREEZE.
ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO
IS TELL THE TRUTH.
YOU SAID
THAT WOULD NOT HAPPEN.
YOU'LL HAVE TO
TESTIFY UNDER OATH.
HOW DO YOU THINK
I FEEL?
WHY DID I HAVE TO
LOOK OUT THAT WINDOW?
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO
CALL THE POLICE?
IF HE'S NOT PUT AWAY,
HE COULD KILL AGAIN.
ALL HE'S BEING TRIED FOR
IS ASSAULT. WHAT A MESS.
IT'S NOT YOUR MESS.
IT'S MINE.
I'LL PROTECT YOU
FROM IT.
SO FAR, ALL YOU'VE DONE
IS GRANDSTAND.
FIRST FOR ME,
AND NOW FOR THEM.
YOU BELIEVE THAT?
YOU WANTED TO BE
THE HERO.
SEE WHERE
IT'S GOTTEN US?
I AM THE ONE
WITH EVERYTHING TO LOSE!
SYLVIA.
HEY.
I THOUGHT IT WAS YOU.
HOW LONG... WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?
I'LL WALK A WHILE
IF YOU LIKE.
OH, I'M... I'M GOING.
I WAS HAPPY TO HEAR THEY'RE
GOING TO PROSECUTE
WHAT HAPPENED? YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT IT LATER AND WERE SURE?
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
I'M BETTER. I'M DOING
THINGS LIKE THIS NOW.
I USED TO RUN AT NIGHT.
MOSTLY I'M JUST
WAITING TO TESTIFY.
IT'S ALL I THINK ABOUT.
I'M NERVOUS. ARE YOU?
YOUR TESTIMONY IS MUCH
MORE IMPORTANT THAN MINE.
EVEN IF I HAVE TO GET UP ON
THE STAND, I WANT TO GET HIM.
YOU MUST FEEL
THE SAME WAY.
YEAH.
I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU
HOW MUCH IT MEANS TO ME
TO SEE SOMEONE WHO'S NOT
AFRAID TO COME FORWARD.
I'M NOT DOING SO MUCH.
YOU'RE TELLING THE TRUTH.
THAT'S MORE THAN
MOST PEOPLE WOULD DO.
SEE YOU IN COURT.
OH, TERRY, I'M SO ASHAMED.
DO YOU HATE ME?
OF COURSE I WANT
TO STAND BY YOU.
I'M JUST SCARED.
SO AM I.
YOU FORGIVE ME?
DO YOU?
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS.
I WANT TO.
I DIDN'T.
AND I WANT TO COME
TO THE TRIAL.
WHEN YOU TESTIFY,
YOU'LL BE TESTIFYING
FOR BOTH OF US.
YOU'LL BE SAYING
THE WORDS,
BUT THEY'LL BE
MY WORDS.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE
WITH YOU.
THIS WAY.
STATE YOUR NAME
FOR THE COURT, PLEASE.
YOU SWEAR THE EVIDENCE
YOU'RE ABOUT TO GIVE
IS THE TRUTH,
THE WHOLE TRUTH,
AND NOTHING
BUT THE TRUTH?
YES.
PLEASE TAKE
THE STAND.
THIS WON'T TAKE LONG.
WHAT WERE YOU DOING ON
APRIL 21st AT 2:15 A.M.?
LOOKING OUT
MY BEDROOM WINDOW.
YOUR BEDROOM OVERLOOKS
THE PARK?
YES.
A MAN FIGHTING
WITH A WOMAN.
PHYSICALLY FIGHTING?
WOULD YOU DESCRIBE
AS EXACTLY AS YOU ARE ABLE
HE HAD HOLD OF HER FROM
BEHIND, TRYING TO DRAG HER...
OBJECTION. CONCLUSION.
SUSTAINED.
WAS HE DRAGGING HER?
YES, TOWARD THE STREET.
THEN WHAT HAPPENED?
HE THREW HER DOWN
ON HER FACE,
GRABBED HOLD
OF HER NECK,
AND STARTED
TO STRANGLE HER.
WHAT DID YOU DO?
I WENT TO YELL
OUT MY WINDOW.
SHE SCREAMED,
AND HE RAN AWAY.
I'D LIKE YOU TO LOOK
AROUND THIS COURTROOM.
DO YOU SEE THE MAN YOU
SAW ATTACK THAT GIRL?
YES.
PLEASE POINT HIM OUT.
LET THE RECORD SHOW THE WITNESS
IS POINTING AT THE DEFENDANT.
YOU ARE SURE THE DEFENDANT
IS THE MAN YOU SAW?
YES, I AM.
THANK YOU, MR. LAMBERT.
ONE MOMENT, MR. LAMBERT.
THERE ARE TWO LAWYERS
IN THIS CASE.
YES, I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE YOU
THROUGH THIS ONE MORE TIME.
PERHAPS IN A LITTLE
MORE DETAIL.
YOU WERE IN YOUR APARTMENT
ON EAST MOUNT VERNON PLACE.
YOU LOOKED OUT
YOUR WINDOW
AND YOU SAW A MAN
FIGHTING WITH A WOMAN.
YES.
WHAT TIME WAS THAT?
WHAT WERE YOU DOING JUST PRIOR
TO LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW?
JUST PRIOR?
WERE YOU
WATCHING TELEVISION?
READING?
CHATTING WITH FRIENDS?
SLEEPING.
IN YOUR BED?
YES.
NOT IN A CHAIR?
NO, I WAS IN MY BED.
WHEN DID YOU
GO TO BED?
AROUND 11:00.
YOU HAD BEEN TO A PARTY
THAT NIGHT, CORRECT?
YES.
DID YOU HAVE
MUCH TO DRINK?
NO. I LEFT EARLY.
I HAD BEEN WORKING
HARD AND WAS TIRED.
SO YOU WENT HOME
TO GET SOME SLEEP.
YOU'RE SOUND ASLEEP
AT 2:00 A.M.
WHAT WOKE YOU UP?
I HEARD A SCREAM.
THERE WERE TWO MUFFLED SCREAMS.
WHAT DID YOU DO?
I WENT TO THE WINDOW.
DID YOU TURN ON
A LIGHT?
DID YOU STOP
TO GET SOME MILK?
AND THAT'S WHEN YOU SAW
THIS MAN AND WOMAN FIGHTING.
I WENT TO OPEN THE
WINDOW, BUT IT STUCK.
THE WOMAN
SCREAMED,
DID HE RUN AWAY AS
SOON AS SHE SCREAMED?
SHE SCREAMED TWICE,
"HELP! HELP ME!"
AND THE MAN RAN AWAY,
I THINK.
WELL, IT ALL HAPPENED
PRETTY QUICKLY.
HOW QUICKLY?
WHAT?
YOU SAW
THESE PEOPLE FIGHTING.
THE WOMAN SCREAMED,
THE MAN RAN AWAY.
IT HAPPENED VERY QUICKLY.
HOW QUICKLY?
FIVE SECONDS?
UH... IT MUST HAVE BEEN
LONGER THAN THAT.
FOR ALL THAT
TO HAPPEN. YEAH.
WHY DON'T WE JUST SAY
THAT YOU SAW THIS MAN
FOR A BRIEF TIME PERIOD,
DURING MOST OF WHICH
HE WAS MOVING QUICKLY.
WOULD THAT BE
AN ACCURATE STATEMENT?
HOW FAR IS IT
FROM YOUR WINDOW
TO THE FOUNTAIN STEPS?
15 YARDS?
IT'S 22 YARDS.
IT'S 22 YARDS.
I NEVER MEASURED.
WELL, WE DID
MEASURE IT.
THE NIGHT OF APRIL 21st,
WAS THAT A CLEAR NIGHT?
IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR.
SO VISIBILITY WAS GOOD.
THERE ARE
STREETLIGHTS ALSO.
THERE ARE THREE,
SPACED ALONG THE BLOCK.
YES. THE PARK'S
WELL-LIT.
WELL-LIT?
OH, YES.
AS WELL-LIT
AS THIS COURTROOM?
NO.
YOU'RE SURE?
OF COURSE.
OF COURSE YOU'RE SURE.
YOUR HONOR,
WITH YOUR PERMISSION,
OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR.
WHAT KIND OF EXPERIMENT?
THIS EXPERIMENT
IS RELEVANT?
YES. IT'LL TAKE
TWO MINUTES.
THE COURT CAN INDULGE
DEFENSE COUNSEL
FOR TWO MINUTES.
THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.
ONE THING
BEFORE WE BEGIN...
MR. LAMBERT, WOULD YOU
REMOVE YOUR CONTACT LENSES?
YOUR CONTACT LENSES. YOU'RE
WEARING THEM, AREN'T YOU?
YES.
THEN KINDLY
REMOVE THEM.
MR. LAMBERT WEARS
HARD CONTACT LENSES.
THAT'S TRUE,
ISN'T IT?
THEY'RE IRRITATING
IF YOU SLEEP WITH THEM IN.
HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN THEM
OUT THAT NIGHT.
ISN'T THAT TRUE?
HE JUST SAID THAT WHEN
HE WAS AWAKENED BY SCREAMS,
HE HURRIED TO THE WINDOW
WITHOUT MAKING ANY STOPS.
SURELY HE WON'T NOW SAY
HE PUT IN CONTACT LENSES.
WILL YOU?
NO, I DIDN'T
HAVE THEM IN.
SO I REPEAT MY REQUEST
THAT YOU REMOVE THEM.
I THINK YOU'D BETTER
REMOVE THEM. HERE.
NO, I, UH...
I HAVE
A LENS CASE.
NOW, MR. LAMBERT,
THE DISTANCE BETWEEN US
FROM YOUR BEDROOM WINDOW
TO THE FOUNTAIN STEPS.
TURN OUT THE LIGHTS.
OBJECTION.
IF WE ARE TO RE-CREATE
THE CIRCUMSTANCES
UNDER WHICH THE WITNESS
OBSERVED THE DEFENDANT,
SURELY IT SHOULD BE DONE
PROPERLY, BY EXPERTS.
LET'S INDULGE DEFENSE
COUNSELOR FOR TWO MINUTES.
FRANKLY, I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHERE
THIS IS HEADING. PROCEED.
THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.
MR. LAMBERT, I'M HOLDING
IN MY HAND AN OBJECT.
COULD YOU KINDLY
TELL THE COURT
WHAT THIS OBJECT IS?
IT'S A...
YOU'RE HOLDING, UM...
COME ON, MR. LAMBERT.
WHAT IS IT?
I CAN'T QUITE
MAKE IT OUT.
COME ON, MR. LAMBERT.
WHAT IS IT?
AAH!
AAH! AAH!
HELP!
HELP ME!
SHALL I GIVE YOU A HINT,
MR. LAMBERT?
IS IT A CAP?
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
IS IT A LADY'S SLIPPER?
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
IS IT A RED WIG?
WELL, LET'S TRY IT
WITH THE LIGHTS ON.
HOW ABOUT NOW,
MR. LAMBERT?
I CAN SEE...
I CAN SEE THAT
SOMETHING'S THERE.
BUT YOU CAN'T IDENTIFY IT,
NOT EVEN
WITH THE LIGHTS ON.
JUST A BOOK, MR. LAMBERT.
JUST A RED BOOK.
I SEE WHY
MOTOR VEHICLES STIPULATES
THAT YOU CAN'T DRIVE
WITHOUT GLASSES OR CONTACTS.
YOU'RE SHORTSIGHTED.
YES.
IN FACT, YOU'RE
EXTREMELY SHORTSIGHTED.
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT EXTREMELY.
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE THAT A PERSON WHO
FAILED TO DISTINGUISH AN OBJECT
IN A BRIGHTLY LIT COURTROOM
FROM 20 YARDS AWAY
COULD FAIRLY BE DESCRIBED
AS EXTREMELY SHORTSIGHTED?
YES.
WOULDN'T YOU ALSO AGREE
THAT IT WOULD BE UNLIKELY
THAT AN EXTREMELY
SHORTSIGHTED PERSON
COULD POSITIVELY IDENTIFY
SOMEONE GLIMPSED AT NIGHT
FROM 22 YARDS AWAY
FOR ONLY A FEW SECONDS?
YOU NEVER SAID
YOU'RE NEARSIGHTED!
YOU NEVER ASKED.
WITH MOTOR VEHICLE
REGISTRATION!
ACCUSED ASSAILANT
CHRIS HENDERSON
THE CASE AGAINST HIM
DISMISSED
FOR INSUFFICIENT
EVIDENCE.
BALTIMORE POLICE REPORT
NO NEW LEADS
IN THE SO-CALLED
DUMPSTER MURDERS.
COULD I TALK TO YOU, PLEASE?
I'M YOUR NEIGHBOR.
IT'S FUNNY HOW TWO PEOPLE
CAN LIVE SO CLOSE
AND...
MY NAME IS KATHY.
KATHY HOFFNER.
TERRY LAMBERT.
OH, PLEASE EXCUSE
THE WAY I LOOK.
I'M SUCH A SLOB TODAY.
I HEARD YOUR FOOTSTEPS
ON THE STAIRS,
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS
PROBABLY YOU,
SO I JUST THREW THIS ON
AND CAME OUT.
WELL, I'M JUST
GETTING HOME.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER
TO SAY ANYTHING,
I FEEL FUNNY ABOUT TALKING
BEHIND PEOPLE'S BACKS.
TALK TO WHO?
THE POLICE.
THE POLICE.
OH, YOU MEAN BACK THEN.
I TALKED TO THEM
BACK THEN, TOO.
THEY ASKED ME IF I WAS
AWAKENED BY THE ATTACK.
THEY WERE HERE
AGAIN TODAY.
TODAY?
THEY ASKED ME IF
I SAW YOU THAT NIGHT.
SEEN ME?
FIRST I THOUGHT
I HADN'T.
THEN I REMEMBERED
THAT I HAD PEEKED OUT
WHEN I HEARD FOOTSTEPS
COMING UP THE STAIRS.
I WAS NERVOUS
AFTER WHAT HAD HAPPENED.
WHAT DID YOU SEE?
I SAW YOU
COMING BACK IN.
THIS WAS LATER, AFTER THE
EXCITEMENT HAD DIED DOWN.
I WENT OUT
FOR SOME AIR.
DID YOU SEE ME
GO OUT?
THE POLICE ASKED ME
THE SAME QUESTION.
I JUST SAW YOU COMING IN.
MUST HAVE BEEN AFTER 3:00.
OH, I'M SURE IT WASN'T THAT LATE.
NO.
THANKS FOR LETTING ME
KNOW ABOUT THE POLICE.
ANYTIME.
ANYTIME AT ALL.
YOU HEARD
THEY LET HIM GO.
IT'S SICKENING,
ISN'T IT?
WANT A BEER?
THANKS. I WOULD.
SO THAT'S THE FAMOUS
BEDROOM WINDOW?
YEAH.
DO YOU MIND?
I KNOW, TERRY.
WHAT?
IT WASN'T YOU
IN THE BEDROOM WINDOW.
SHE WAS THE WITNESS.
SHE SAW IT, NOT YOU.
WHO? I'M SORRY
THEY LET HIM GO.
BUT YOU WENT FORWARD...
SAVE IT, TERRY!
I SAW HER IN THE PARK,
AND I SAW HER IN COURT
COACHING YOU. PATHETIC.
WHAT, IS SHE MARRIED?
MUST BE,
TO SOMEONE POWERFUL.
IT DOESN'T MATTER, REALLY. WHAT
MATTERS IS HE'S OUT THERE, FREE.
THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN
BE DONE ABOUT THAT.
THEY CAN'T
TRY HIM AGAIN.
NOT FOR ATTACKING ME,
BUT WITH
SOME MORE INFORMATION,
THEY MIGHT BE ABLE
TO GET HIM
FOR WHAT HE DID
TO THE OTHERS,
THE GIRLS THAT DIDN'T HAVE SOMEONE
LIKE YOU TO PROTECT THEM.
THE QUESTION ISN'T
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO,
IT'S WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO
AND WHAT IS SHE
GOING TO DO?
NOW IT'S MY TURN
TO WATCH.
THANKS FOR THE BEER.
TERRY!
THE COPS HAVE BEEN HERE.
THEY JUST LEFT.
HERE? THEY WANT
ME TO CALL THEM?
THEY DON'T WANT
TO TALK TO YOU...
THEY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT YOU.
ABOUT ME?
HOW LONG YOU'VE BEEN HERE,
WHAT YOU'RE LIKE.
THEY ALSO WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE
NIGHT OF THAT PARTY WE HAD.
WHAT YOUR MOOD WAS,
WHY YOU LEFT EARLY.
IT'S ALMOST AS THOUGH THEY
SUSPECT YOU OF SOMETHING.
DID THEY ASK
ANYTHING ELSE?
IF I'D NOTICED
ANYTHING UNUSUAL ABOUT YOU
ON APRIL 26 OR 27.
WHAT?
THEY THINK YOU KEEP
A DIARY OF MY MOODS?
WHY WOULD THEY ASK ABOUT
THOSE DATES IN PARTICULAR?
WHO KNOWS?
ANYWAY, THANKS, COLLIN. I'M
SORRY THEY BOTHERED YOU.
THE POLICE DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU, NOT YET.
THEY'VE BEEN QUESTIONING
MY NEIGHBORS.
I THINK THEY'VE
TAPPED MY PHONE.
THEY'VE BEEN
WATCHING ME.
SHE SAW YOU IN COURT.
SHE'S FIGURED IT OUT.
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
TERRY, YOU MADE A MISTAKE,
A SIMPLE MISTAKE.
THE POLICE
WOULDN'T DO THAT.
THEY WERE AT THE
OFFICE THIS MORNING
QUESTIONING
COLLIN.
COLLIN?
THAT'S RIGHT.
WHY WOULD THEY
QUESTION COLLIN?
ABOUT ME! SYLVIA!
THAT'S WHAT I'M
TRYING TO TELL YOU!
DO THEY SUSPECT YOU WERE...
WITH SOMEBODY?
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY SUSPECT.
IT LOOKS LIKE
THEY'RE WONDERING
IF MAYBE I DIDN'T
KILL THOSE GIRLS.
THEY'RE TRYING TO PUT THE
BLAME ON SOMEBODY ELSE.
IT'S RIDICULOUS.
YOU'RE BEING PARANOID.
ANYWAY, WHAT DID THEY
TALK TO COLLIN ABOUT?
THEY ASKED
ABOUT APRIL 26,
THAT'S THE DATE OF
THE SECOND MURDER.
THEY ALSO ASKED HIM ABOUT
THE NIGHT OF THE PARTY...
WHY I LEFT EARLY.
THE PARTY?
WHAT IF COLLIN STARTS
THINKING ABOUT THE PARTY?
WELL, ONE WAY, THAT WOULD
PARTIALLY SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU WOULDN'T NEED TO BE SO
AFRAID TO GO TO THE POLICE.
GO TO THE POLICE?
I CAN'T DO THAT.
YOU KNOW THAT.
YOU'VE ALWAYS KNOWN.
BESIDES, I THINK YOU'RE
EXAGGERATING THE WHOLE THING.
WHAT ABOUT THE
REDHEAD, HENDERSON?
IF YOU'D TESTIFIED,
HE WOULDN'T HAVE.
I NEVER SAID IT WAS HIM.
I WAS NEVER SURE.
YOU MADE UP YOUR OWN
MIND ABOUT THAT.
IF IT WAS HIM,
HE COULD DO IT AGAIN.
STOP IT, TERRY.
THAT'S NOT FAIR.
IT'S NOT MY FAULT
THIS IS HAPPENING.
BESIDES, IT'LL WORK OUT.
THE POLICE AREN'T FOOLS.
WHAT ABOUT DENISE CONNELLY? WHO?
THE GIRL
THAT WAS ATTACKED!
SHE KNOWS ALL
ABOUT US.
TELL HER WE NEED A LITTLE TIME.
I HAVE TO THINK.
SHE'LL BE REASONABLE,
WON'T SHE?
MAYBE.
SHE HAS TO BE.
I DIDN'T GET US INTO THIS.
YOU KNOW THAT.
I HAVE TO GO NOW.
I DO.
I NEVER EVEN KNEW YOU
WORE CONTACT LENSES.
LITTLE REVERSE ENGLISH, YOU'D
HAVE DONE ALL RIGHT, AL.
THANKS, DENISE.
♪ AND IF YOU EVER TOUCH
MY WOMAN ♪
♪ WELL, BOY,
YOU'RE GONNA WEAR THE SCARS ♪
♪ CHECK IT OUT... ♪
HELLO.
Hi.
I NEED TO TALK.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
♪ CHECK IT OUT ♪
♪ YOU'RE RUNNIN'
OUT OF TIME... ♪
UH, C.C.,
COVER ME, WILL YOU?
♪ WITH A CRIMINAL MIND ♪
♪ AH YA YA YA... ♪
NOW, THE POLICE SEEM TO HAVE
GOTTEN IT INTO THEIR HEADS
THAT MAYBE I HAD
SOMETHING TO DO
THEY KNOW YOU LIED.
THEY JUST DON'T KNOW WHY.
YEAH. DID YOU SEE ANY
OF IT THAT NIGHT?
SHE SAW IT, BUT
SHE WOULDN'T GO FORWARD,
SO YOU TOOK HER PLACE.
I THOUGHT I COULD
BRING IT OFF.
AND SHE LET YOU?
YOU'RE EITHER
A ROMANTIC FOOL,
OR YOU'RE AN IDIOT.
I DON'T KNOW
WHICH IS WORSE.
WHAT DOES SHE SAY NOW,
NOW THAT YOU'RE IN A SPOT?
SHE WANTS TO WAIT...
GIVE TIME TO THE
POLICE TO SORT IT OUT.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
HER POSITION.
SURE, I DO. SHE HAS A HUSBAND
AND A STUD ON THE SIDE,
AND NOBODY THE WISER. SHE
WANTS TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.
UH, DENISE...
YEAH. SO, WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO NOW?
IF I HAD IT TO DO OVER,
I'D DO IT DIFFERENTLY.
BUT IT WAS MY IDEA TO
HANDLE IT THE WAY WE DID,
AND I JUST DON'T THINK
IT'S FAIR FOR ME
UNLESS SHE'S COME TO THE
SAME CONCLUSION I HAVE.
LIKE I SAID,
A ROMANTIC FOOL.
WHAT ABOUT HENDERSON?
SHE'S NOT SURE IT WAS
HENDERSON, AND SHE NEVER WAS.
BUT YOU WERE SURE. THAT
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
AND I'D LIKE TO TELL IT TO YOU SOMEDAY.
I WOULD.
BUT RIGHT NOW, DENISE, ALL I
WANT IS A LITTLE MORE TIME.
DENISE, SERIOUSLY.
COME ON.
BUT I'M GIVING THE TIME
TO YOU, NOT TO HER.
YOU'RE THE ROMANTIC FOOL.
SHE KNOWS EXACTLY
WHAT SHE'S DOING.
♪ OH, YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, YEAH ♪
♪ NA, NA, NA ♪
Child: I'VE GOT IT!
HA HA HA!
MR. LAMBERT?
GOOD MORNING.
WOULD YOU MIND
COMING WITH ME?
DETECTIVE QUIRKE AND I WOULD LIKE
TO TALK TO YOU FOR A FEW MINUTES.
SHALL I FOLLOW YOU?
THAT'S Okay.
I'LL BRING YOU BACK.
MR. LAMBERT.
SEEMS YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
EXACTLY TRUTHFUL WITH US.
OH, YES. I'M SORRY
ABOUT THE CONTACTS.
THAT'S OUR FAULT.
WE SHOULD HAVE ASKED.
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT THAT.
WE'VE LEARNED THAT
YOU WENT OUT THAT NIGHT.
YOU TOLD US YOU WERE IN BED.
YES.
THAT YOU WERE AWAKENED,
YOU WITNESSED THE ATTACK,
AND THEN YOU WENT
RIGHT BACK TO BED.
YES, I DID GO OUT.
I... I FORGOT.
YOU FORGOT?
YES, I...
YEAH, I DID. IT'S...
WHEN DID YOU GO OUT?
UH, AFTERWARD,
BEFORE I WENT BACK TO SLEEP.
I WENT TO GET SOME AIR
AND LOOK AROUND.
I WAS ALL KEYED UP.
IT'S...
WHEN DID YOU
COME BACK?
A FEW MINUTES LATER.
THAT'S WHY I FORGOT.
LOOK, I KNOW THAT
YOU'VE BEEN QUESTIONING
MY NEIGHBORS
AND MY BOSS,
AND YOU'VE BEEN
HAVING ME FOLLOWED,
BUT I...
LOOK, YOU DON'T
REALLY THINK THAT I'M...
I'M NOT A SUSPECT,
AM I?
SUPPOSE YOU TELL US
ABOUT THE BAR.
WHAT BAR?
WHERE THE MURDERED
GIRL STEPHANIE LUGIE
SPENT THE LAST
HOURS OF HER LIFE,
WHERE NO ONE... NO
ONE... CAN REMEMBER
HAVING SEEN THE REDHEAD
CHRIS HENDERSON.
COCKTAIL WAITRESS REMEMBERS
YOU QUITE CLEARLY.
SHE SPILLED
A DRINK ON YOU.
WAS THAT SOMETHING
ELSE YOU FORGOT?
WHERE DID YOU
GET THAT PICTURE?
AM I...
ARE YOU ARRESTING ME?
NO. NOT JUST YET.
WE'RE MOVING A LITTLE
SLOWER THIS TIME AROUND.
I DON'T THINK I SHOULD
ANSWER ANY MORE QUESTIONS
UNTIL I CONSULT
AN ATTORNEY.
THAT MIGHT BE
WELL-ADVISED.
HELLO.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU
CAN'T JUST CALL HERE!
WE HAVE TO TALK.
THAT'S
IMPOSSIBLE!
I HAVE TO SEE YOU
RIGHT AWAY.
NO! I CAN'T
SEE YOU.
I CAN'T SEE YOU
AT ALL ANYMORE.
I'VE BEEN TO THE POLICE.
THEY'VE BEEN QUESTIONING ME.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
I CAN'T SEE YOU,
AND I CAN'T
TALK TO YOU.
SYLVIA,
DON'T MAKE ME...
I HAVE TO GO NOW.
DON'T HANG UP ON ME!
GOODBYE!
WHO WAS THAT, DEAR?
TERRY.
TERRY LAMBERT.
TELL MRS. WENTWORTH
IT'S TERRY LAMBERT.
WAS SHE EXPECTING YOU?
I'M SORRY,
BUT SHE ISN'T HERE.
YOU TELL HER,
OR SHALL I?
SHE'S NOT HERE.
NO ONE'S HERE.
WHERE ARE THEY?
DAMN IT!
WHERE HAVE THEY GONE?
THE BALLET.
THEY'VE GONE
TO THE BALLET.
I don't know.
Listen, I'm going to talk with him.
What are you doing here?
You gave me no choice.
Are you crazy?
People will see us!
We've gone past where any of that matters.
You may have.
I haven't.
Our affair, the fact that you witnessed the attack...
I'VE TOLD YOU...
I WILL NEVER, NEVER
SYLVIA! I'VE TOLD YOU
THAT FROM THE START!
SHH!
DON'T TOUCH ME!
THEY SUSPECT ME OF MURDER.
I'VE BEEN FOLLOWED.
THEY MAY HAVE
FOLLOWED ME HERE.
THEY MAY BE WATCHING
ME RIGHT NOW.
THEN YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOICE
BUT TO TALK TO COLLIN MYSELF.
I'M SORRY, TERRY, BUT
IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT.
I'VE ALREADY TOLD HIM.
I HAD A FEELING...
TOLD HIM WHAT?
THAT I WENT TO BED
WITH YOU... ONCE.
ON CONDITION I SWEAR I WAS IN BED
WITH HIM THE NIGHT OF THE PARTY.
HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE
DRAGGED INTO THAT MESS!
I TOLD HIM I WOULD.
HEY!
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
YEAH, THANK YOU.
I'M FINE.
I HAD TO.
I HAD NO CHOICE.
AND I TOLD HIM YOU'D
BEEN AFTER ME EVER SINCE
TO CONTINUE THE AFFAIR,
TO SAY I WAS WITH YOU
WHEN I WASN'T.
YOU'LL HAVE TO FIND SOME OTHER
WAY TO SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS.
THERE IS NO OTHER WAY.
WITH OR WITHOUT YOU,
I'M GOING TO THE POLICE.
WELL,
YOU DO WHAT
YOU HAVE TO DO...
AND I'LL DO
WHAT I HAVE TO DO.
GOODBYE.
IT WAS HIM, WASN'T IT?
THE REDHEAD?
LET GO OF ME, PLEASE.
YOU WERE SURE,
WEREN'T YOU,
RIGHT
FROM THE BEGINNING?
YOU WERE SURE
IT WAS HENDERSON.
ALL RIGHT.
I WAS SURE!
OF COURSE
I WAS SURE.
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH MY EYES.
THE ACT
IS ALMOST OVER.
IT WOULD BE
BETTER TO WAIT.
OF COURSE.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
OH!
MMM MMM MMM!
AH!
AH... AH...
SYLVIA!
YOU BASTARD!
GRAB HIM!
HE STABBED MY WIFE!
UNH!
GET HIM!
AAH!
OH! OH, GOD!
AAH!
HE KILLED MY WIFE!
STOP HIM!
AAH!
CALL THE POLICE!
AAH!
AAH!
GET HIM!
GET HIM!
AAH!
AAH!
HE'S THE KILLER!
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE BACK HERE.
HEY! SECURITY!
GET SECURITY!
YEAH...
THE BACK DOOR.
TONIGHT THE BALTIMORE
SOCIAL COMMUNITY IS SHOCKED
OVER THE MURDER
OF ONE OF ITS OWN.
BUT POLICE REFUSE
TO SPECULATE
HERE AT THE TOWNSEND
THEATER IS CONNECTED
TO THE SO-CALLED
DUMPSTER MURDERS.
AN EMPLOYEE OF
THE DEAD WOMAN'S HUSBAND,
COLLIN WENTWORTH,
WAS A WITNESS
TO AN EARLIER
RELATED ASSAULT.
POLICE ARE SEEKING HIM
FOR QUESTIONING.
THANK YOU, CRAIG, FOR
THAT LIVE MINICAM REPORT.
HUNDREDS OF SCHOOLCHILDREN
SWARMED ABOARD THE TALL SHIP...
DENISE...
OH!
OH! OW!
DENISE!
OH, MY GOD.
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
WELL,
HERE IT IS.
GOOD NIGHT.
YEAH.
THANKS, PETER.
GOOD NIGHT.
SO, WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?
I'LL TELL THEM EVERYTHING AND
TRY TO GET THEM TO BELIEVE ME.
YOU'D SEEN US TOGETHER.
YOU SAW SYLVIA
AT THE TRIAL.
WHY SHOULDN'T SHE BE
AT THE TRIAL?
BUT DENISE, YOU KNOW
SHE WAS THE REAL WITNESS.
I CAN SAY I THINK THAT.
I CAN'T PROVE IT.
THOSE PEOPLE
AT THE TOWNSEND THEATER
WILL SAY THEY THINK
YOU KILLED HER.
I LED HIM
STRAIGHT TO HER.
I KNEW I WAS BEING FOLLOWED,
BUT NOT THAT IT WAS HENDERSON.
AND HE COULDN'T
HAVE PLANNED IT BETTER.
HE GOT RID OF THE ONE PERSON
THAT COULD IMPLICATE HIM
AND THE ONE PERSON
THAT COULD CLEAR ME.
SO NOW IT LOOKS
LIKE I WAS TRYING
TO SHIFT THE BLAME
FROM THE BEGINNING.
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS.
WANT A BEER?
YEAH.
TELL ME
SOMETHING.
YOU DIDN'T SUSPECT ME
LIKE THE POLICE. WHY?
I KNEW SOMETHING
THE POLICE DIDN'T.
REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME
WE MET? THE LINE-UP?
HOW COULD I FORGET?
I KNEW SOMETHING
WAS WRONG EVEN THEN.
IT WAS OBVIOUS YOU'D
NEVER SEEN ME BEFORE,
FROM YOUR BEDROOM WINDOW
OR ANYPLACE ELSE,
AND YOU WERE COMPLETELY
INDIFFERENT TO WHAT YOU DID SEE.
NOT FLATTERING, PERHAPS, BUT
UPON REFLECTION, TRUSTWORTHY.
YOU WEREN'T INTERESTED
IN FUCKING ME,
AND YOU CERTAINLY WEREN'T
INTERESTED IN KILLING ME.
YOU WEREN'T INTERESTED,
PERIOD.
HE'LL DO IT AGAIN,
YOU KNOW.
KILL SOME GIRL,
OR TRY TO.
I'LL BE SAFE IN JAIL.
THE PERFECT ALIBI.
I WONDER WHAT
SETS HIM OFF.
BETWEEN THE 2 OF US, WE KNOW
MORE ABOUT IT THAN ANYBODY.
YOU WERE THERE
THAT NIGHT AT THE BAR
WHEN HE PICKED OUT
THAT SORORITY GIRL.
THE NIGHT HE ATTACKED ME, I
DON'T REMEMBER HIM AT THE BAR,
BUT HE WAS PROBABLY THERE
WATCHING ME.
DO WE LOOK ALIKE AT ALL,
THAT OTHER GIRL AND ME?
NOT REALLY.
WHAT MADE HIM
SINGLE HER OUT?
WHAT MADE HIM
NOTICE HER IN PARTICULAR?
WELL, EVERYBODY
NOTICED HER.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WELL, SHE DANCED.
DANCED...
TO A RECORD?
WITH HER FRIENDS CHEERING HER ON.
SHE WAS SEXY.
YOU DIDN'T DANCE FOR
HIM, DID YOU?
SURE. ON A THURSDAY NIGHT,
THE PLACE IS PACKED.
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO BREATHE.
DID ANYTHING UNUSUAL
HAPPEN THAT NIGHT?
IT WAS PETER'S BIRTHDAY.
PETER?
I REMEMBER, BECAUSE THE NEXT
DAY, AFTER WHAT HAPPENED,
HE TOLD ME I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN
HIM THE PRESENT HE WISHED FOR...
HE WANTED ME
TO GO HOME WITH HIM.
WHAT HAPPENED
THAT WAS SO UNUSUAL?
AT MIDNIGHT...
WE'D GOTTEN HIM A CAKE...
AND AT MIDNIGHT, C.C.
AND I BROUGHT IT OUT.
Okay, YOU GUYS!
THIS ONE'S FOR PETER!
♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU ♪
♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU ♪
♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY,
DEAR PETER ♪
♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU ♪
YAY!
PETER MADE A WISH
AND BLEW OUT ALL THE CANDLES.
AND THEN I KISSED HIM.
YES, I KISSED HIM,
AND SO I KISSED HIM AGAIN,
AND THEY CHEERED EVEN LOUDER.
WHOA!
THEN HE KISSED ME.
I MEAN HE REALLY
KISSED ME,
AND EVERYBODY
WENT CRAZY.
BUT YOU DON'T REMEMBER
HIM THERE, HENDERSON?
AT THAT OTHER BAR, EITHER,
THE ONE WHERE YOU SAW HIM.
ANOTHER BEER?
YEAH.
TWO VICTIMS.
BOTH YOUNG, BOTH PRETTY.
BOTH WERE IN BARS WHERE THEY
COULD BE WATCHED BY HIM,
AND BOTH DID SOMETHING THAT MADE
THEM THE CENTER OF ATTENTION.
MAYBE HE GETS EXCITED,
TOO, BUT HE WANTS TO KILL.
WHAT A GUY.
WHAT CAN I DO? I'LL TAKE MY
CHANCES WITH THE POLICE.
DO YOU KNOW
ANY LAWYERS?
YEAH, A GUY I USED
TO GO TO SCHOOL WITH.
I THOUGHT
I'D GIVE HIM A CALL.
IT MIGHT BE BETTER
TO GO IN WITH SOMEBODY.
YOU CAN STAY HERE
TONIGHT IF YOU WANT...
ON THE COUCH.
CALL HIM
IN THE MORNING.
DID YOU LOVE HER?
SYLVIA?
LOVE...
I DIDN'T REALLY EVEN
KNOW HER, AS WE'VE SEEN.
I WAS JUST SOMETHING
FOR HER TO DO.
I CAN THINK OF
WORSE THINGS TO DO.
HERE.
YOU'RE AWAKE.
WHAT TIME IS IT?
ABOUT 4:30.
LISTEN... WHY DON'T YOU
COME INTO MY ROOM?
I'D LIKE YOU TO.
I FIND YOU ATTRACTIVE.
I MEAN,
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
THAT IS TRUE, BUT...
THAT'S NOT
THE REAL REASON.
EVER SINCE THAT NIGHT,
I HAVEN'T
BEEN ABLE TO...
TO DO CERTAIN THINGS.
TONIGHT,
I THINK I COULD,
I MEAN,
IF YOU... WANT TO.
COME HERE.
COME HERE.
THERE'S A BED IN THERE.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS?
NOTHING, I GUESS.
TERRY? COME HERE.
WHAT'S WRONG?
WAIT A SECOND.
THINGS ARE DEFINITELY LOOKING
BETTER TO ME THIS MORNING.
ME, TOO.
I WAS THINKING.
ABOUT IT BEING ONLY A MATTER
OF TIME WITH HENDERSON,
AND SOONER OR LATER,
HE'LL KILL AGAIN? YEAH.
AND THAT WOULD CLEAR UP
YOUR PROBLEM?
IT COULD HAPPEN SOONER
INSTEAD OF LATER,
WITH A LITTLE HELP.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
THINK ABOUT IT.
SOME GIRL WHO COULD
INADVERTENTLY PUSH HIS BUTTONS.
THAT COULD TAKE
A LONG TIME.
WHAT IF SOME GIRL WHO
KNEW WHAT BUTTONS TO PUSH
DELIBERATELY
SET ABOUT PUSHING THEM?
A GIRL WHO WAS HIS TYPE?
FORGET IT.
WHY?
I WON'T LET YOU.
WHY?
IT'S DANGEROUS.
NOT IF YOU HELP.
WE WON'T LET IT BE.
NO. I SAID FORGET IT.
THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE THE OFFER.
IT'S NO MORE
THAN YOU DID FOR HER.
THAT I WAS EITHER A
ROMANTIC FOOL OR AN IDIOT.
I WAS PROBABLY BOTH.
YOU KNOW, IF I WANT TO
AHEAD, YOU COULDN'T STOP ME.
YOU'D BE IN CUSTODY,
REMEMBER?
BUT I DO HAVE MY OWN REASONS
FOR WANTING HIM CAUGHT.
HE ASSAULTED ME.
IF I THOUGHT
YOU WERE SERIOUS...
IT WOULD NEVER WORK. HE
WOULDN'T GO FOR YOU AGAIN.
HE'D KNOW
IT WAS A TRAP.
NOT IF HE DIDN'T
RECOGNIZE ME.
YOU JUST DON'T THINK
I'M SEXY ENOUGH
TO MAKE HIM TRY.
WHY WOULDN'T HE
RECOGNIZE YOU?
BECAUSE, TERRY,
I'M A WOMAN,
IN CASE YOU STILL
HAVEN'T NOTICED.
HOW DO I LOOK?
UH, DETECTIVE QUIRKE,
IT'S TERRY LAMBERT.
NEVER MIND THAT NOW.
YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG.
UH, I WANT TO
GIVE MYSELF UP.
I DO,
BUT JUST TO YOU...
AND DETECTIVE JESSUP.
WELL, THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT YOU TO DO.
NO, NOT NOW. TONIGHT.
LOOK, ONE MORE DAY
WON'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
LOOK, JUST BE
AT THIS NUMBER AFTER 10:00.
I'LL TELL YOU
ABOUT IT THEN.
JUST BE THERE.
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO YOUR EYEBROWS?
DYED.
FAKE EYELASHES.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
YEAH.
YEAH.
WHY WOULD HE HAVE
TO WORK LATE TONIGHT?
WHY NOT?
WHAT IF HE DOESN'T
GO OUT?
WHAT IF HE GOES HOME
AFTER WORK?
THEN THAT'S IT.
I CALL QUIRKE.
LOOK.
NOW, REMEMBER.
STAY BACK A LITTLE.
WATCH ME
IN YOUR REAR-VIEW MIRROR.
I'LL BE
RIGHT BEHIND YOU.
GO...
YOU BETTER HURRY.
GO.
WE DON'T GET SEPARATED,
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS.
YOU LOSE ME, STOP AND
WAIT FOR ME TO CATCH UP.
BUT BY THEN,
HE'D BE...
WE DON'T GET SEPARATED
NO MATTER WHAT, AGREED?
AGREED!
COME ON.
COME ON.
COME ON.
COME ON!
NOT ONE OF YOUR BETTER
PLACES IN TOWN.
THERE'S A PHONE BOOTH

ONE MORE TIME.

TO SET THE HOOK.

GONNA GO FOR IT...

Mr Bobster, are you all right, sir?
Oh!
Ah!
Aah...!
Aah...!
It was a cold, snowy day in early December.
Lack of funds had forced my old school to close.
I was being sent to a new one in the middle of term.
I was accustomed to the open expanse of the country,
and now I was in the heart of London, at the height of the Victorian era.
The streets teemed with every activity imaginable.
I was very taken by what I saw.
Stepping from my carriage,
the sight of my new school filled me with apprehension.
And yet, I was swept with a wave of curiosity.
However, nothing could prepare me for the adventure that lay ahead,
or the extraordinary individual who would change my life.
There you are, sir.
Stop! Isn't it valuable?
What's more important, its value or my sanity?
I should have mastered it by now.
- How long have you been playing?
- Three days.
- Perhaps you should be patient.
- You're the new boy.
Yes, I've transferred. My name is...
Wait. Let me.
Your name is James Watson.
You're from the north, your father's a doctor, you spend much time writing, and you're fond of custard tarts.
Am I correct?
- My name isn't James, it's John.
- What's the difference?
- A great deal.
- Very well, so your name is John.
- How did I do on the others?
- You were correct.
On every count. How is it done?
Is it some sort of magic trick?
No magic, Watson.
Pure and simple deduction.
The name-tag on your mattress reads "J Watson".
I selected the most common name with "J".
- "John" was my second choice.
- Of course.
Your shoes aren't made in the city.
I've seen them before when visiting the north of England.
Your left middle finger has a callus, the trademark of a writer.
You were carrying a medical book not available to the general public, only to physicians. Since you can't have been to medical school, it was given to you by an older person, someone who is concerned for your health: Your father, the doctor.
- And the custard tarts?
- Simple.
There's a stain of yellow custard used in making tarts on your lapel, and your shape convinced me you've eaten many before.
- There's no need to be rude.
- Come on.
- Hang on, where are we going?
- Do you want to miss Chemistry class?
- By the way, what's your name?
- Holmes. Sherlock Holmes.
The deductive mind never rests, Watson.
It's like a finely-tuned instrument.
It demands practice.
How does one go about fine-tuning a mind?
Problems of logic, mathematical equations, riddles.
For example, you're in a room with an all-southern view.
A bear walks by the window.
What colour is the bear?
- The bear is red.
- Why would the bear be red?
The southern sun is very hot.
The bear would be terribly burnt!
That's the most absurd answer
I've ever heard.
To successfully conclude the experiment...
...the experiment.
To reiterate, experiment fourteen.
Throw a small piece of potassium onto some water.
The liquid will be rapidly decomposed and so violent will be the action that a large amount of light...
Thank you.
He's being particularly boring today.
...the production of potassium alkyl... which will be dissolved...
- That was a girl.
- Brilliant deduction, Watson.
Who is she?
What's she doing in a boys' school?
Her name's Elizabeth.
Following her parents' death, she came to live with her uncle, a retired schoolmaster.
... such is modified by...
Elizabeth was just admiring my new timepiece. Would you like to see?
- Very interesting.
- All stylish gentlemen wear them.
- Expensive?
- From Bond Street.
- I find that unlikely.
- I beg your pardon?
Had you examined the face, you'd see it is French in style.
Yet according to this inscription, the exterior was made in Switzerland.
My suspicion was correct, the works are Italian.
Congratulations, Dudley, your timepiece is a fraud.
Keep your opinions to yourself, Holmes.
I look forward to resuming our conversation...
...when there's a little more privacy.
- Why did you do that?
- Dudley's a pompous ass.
- He's very sweet.
- Really?
Is that why you were standing so close to him, flirting with him?
Do I detect a sense of jealousy?
Holmes, jealous?
That word is not in my vocabulary.
- Neither is punctuality.
- You're angry because I'm late.
- As always.
- I'm sorry, but I can explain.
- You had something more important...
- How can you say that?
I was... Forgive me.
Elizabeth, let me introduce you to my new friend, the honourable, but clumsy, Watson.
- The ladder's a bit wobbly.
- Hello.
Elizabeth! Holmes! I think I've solved all of the problems!
- Who's that?
- My uncle.
Rupert T. Waxflatter, retired schoolmaster.
Degrees in Chemistry and Biology, well-versed in Philosophy.
- Author of 27 books.
- Incredible.
- Most people think he's a lunatic.
- Why?
Oh, my God.
Ooh... oh...!
Oh!
A very hopeful sign.
Very hopeful.
Let me see, that makes six!
Six failed attempts!
Nevertheless, we shall not be defeated. We shall conquer.
I have made up my mind.
The conquest of the skies is in my grasp.
He's done this six times?
I live here with Uncle.
After he retired, the school gave him the attic.
It's incredible.
I've spent many happy hours here.
He's taught me more than ten schoolmasters put together.
- Uncas. Say hello to Watson.
- Say hello, Uncas. Say hello.
Watson, he's not a parrot.
- Have you found the weakness, sir?
- The wing material is inferior.
I shall have to rebuild the entire machine.
The entire machine?
Won't that be difficult?
Elementary, my dear Holmes.
Hm... Erm...
You'll have to excuse me.
Come on, come on, come on.
- I've got it. The bear is black.
- What's that, old chap?
- The bear in the riddle is black.
- Wrong again.
Please don't disturb me while
I'm concentrating on the lesson.
- Are you all right?
- I've sprained my ankle.
Mrs Dribb, will you attend to him, please?
Gentlemen, we cannot permit ourselves lapses in concentration.
We must work on technique, rhythm and balance.
There's no better pupil to illustrate form and technique than Holmes.
Study our stance, our movements and our style.
En garde.
Touché.
Touché.
My game, Holmes.
Now, gentlemen...
...Mr Holmes lost because of one important factor:
His emotions took over.
He ignored discipline.
Never replace discipline with emotion.
Well played, Holmes.
Amen.
- I want to enlist. A general.
- Generals don't make any money.
- I want to be an author.
- Authors don't make money.
- I want to be a barrister.
- Barristers make money.
I want to be a doctor.
- Nobody asked you.
- Sorry.
Holmes, what do you want to be when you grow up?
I never want to be alone.
Uncas!
Uncas!
Why did you do that?
You left me all alone.
There we go.
Hello, is anybody there?
Oh!
Aah...! Ah! Ah...!
Get out of the way!
Aah...!
Holmes is going to solve the crime!
- Holmes is going to solve a crime!
- What?
- Let's go!
- Did you hear? Holmes is going...
It was my second week at Brompton.
With each passing day, my fascination with Holmes continued to grow.
On this occasion, the school was bursting with excitement.
Dudley had challenged Holmes to a test of ingenuity and perception.
Dudley had snatched the fencing trophy and hidden it in a secret place.
He gave Holmes 60 minutes to find the trophy.
Holmes accepted with confidence.
- The game is afoot!
- Hooray!
Good luck, Holmes! Good luck!
There he is!
But this is truly despicable!
Lmagine, a student acting like a chimpanzee!
Mr Snelgrove, he's just having fun.
- Surely you remember what fun was?
- Fun
This Holmes boy is too precocious, too egotistical for his own good.
He'll never find that trophy.
- I'll wager a guinea he does.
- Done.
- Ah!
- Uh.
Excuse me.
Holmes, you've only got one minute.
Holmes, you've only got...
I heard you the first time!
Can't you see I'm concentrating?
Only seconds left.
I assume you're giving up?
Never assume anything.
But Holmes, I see no sign of a trophy.
But I do.
Stop! Holmes, have you gone mad?
This is an antique!
It was a wonderful moment for Holmes.
Little could he know his talents would soon be put to a much greater test.
A test of terrifying and deadly proportions.
I came through the skylight into the kitchen, giving them a fright.
I noticed the particles of freshly-baked ceramic beneath the oven.
Odd for a kitchen used to prepare meals.
So, the clues:
Red and green paint, ceramic.
Pondering this, I kicked the snow from my shoe.
The snow crumbled and revealed my shoe. This struck a chord.
- You heard music?
- Watson, you buffoon!
I'm talking about a parallel, between my foot encased in snow and the trophy encased in some sort of ceramic: A jar, a vase.
- Painted with red and green paint.
- Exactly, Watson.
Holmes! This time
I've definitely solved the problem!
He's going to fly again.
- Mr Lestrade?
- Holmes!
It's been, what, three or four days since your last visit?
- This will only take a minute.
- There are no murder reports,
- no casebooks you haven't read.
- I'm not here for research.
- I'm on to something.
- Not again.
- I'm certain of it.
- Really?
Like when you thought the French ambassador embezzled £300,000?
- It was the Russian ambassador.
- Holmes, please!
I don't have time for any more of your... playpen crimes.
Just have a quick look at these.
- A suicide. A carriage accident.
- I suspect foul play.
Why? They are completely unrelated.
Wrong. Both men graduated from the same university in 1809.
Coincidence.
Neither death fits their personalities.
Bobster was a happy man, content with his life, career and family.
Why commit suicide?
He didn't even leave a note.
Reverend Nesbitt is described as loving and peaceful.
Yet the carriage driver insists he was crazed, in a panic when he ran into the street.
A fluctuation of character is not sufficient for an investigation.
Keep your nose out of the "Times" and into your school books.
I appreciate your time, Mr Lestrade.
I suggest you hold on to these.
If I were a detective sergeant trapped in this room all day,
I'd do everything in my power to seek out that one investigation
- that could promote me to inspector.
- Good day, Holmes.
Holmes!
What are you doing?
Dudley dropped this.
I was giving it back.
- I beg your pardon?
- Your paper.
- It doesn't belong to me.
- You dropped it.
- It isn't even my handwriting.
- Give it...
These are the exam answers.
It appears we have finally discovered the secret of your intelligence.
- But, sir...
- You better come with me.
The fools!
Their age has turned them to granite.
They only listen to themselves.
- I thought they'd consider my record.
- They did.
It did more harm than good.
A record of that quality only convinced the Board you'd cheated all along.
- That's absurd.
- Well, Holmes, you were caught with the answers in front of a classroom of students.
Worse, the answers were in your handwriting.
An excellent forgery. Who'd have suspected Dudley could pull it off?
I can prove my innocence, if you'd give me time.
The Board quoted the school motto five times during our meeting.
- "Honesty, probity and diligence."
- Exactly!
In their eyes, you've committed the worst crime imaginable.
And I'm being given the worst punishment imaginable: Expulsion.
Holmes, I will do everything within my power to help you.
I'll watch this Dudley fellow and write a recommendation that will get you into any school in England.
- I appreciate that, sir.
- If there's anything else I can do...
Oh, well, there is one thing.
- One last duel.
- Yes, sir.
Holmes. You all right?
Fine. It's just a small cut.
I lost concentration for a moment.
I should have removed my ring.
It was an unfair distraction.
- The match is yours.
- Call it a draw.
Come, let Mrs Dribb look at that wound.
Ah!
- There we are.
- Thank you, Mrs Dribb.
We're all going to miss you around here, Mr Holmes.
Come on, giddy-up.
Dudley's going to pay dearly for this.
Punch to the jaw! Jab to the ribs!
Now, Watson, revenge is sweetest when it's served up cold. Come.
Holmes!
You did this!
You're responsible, aren't you?
So that's where I dropped my chemistry experiment: Into your tea!
Don't worry, it will wear off shortly.
You should be back to normal... by summertime.
Chestnuts, hot chestnuts!
Chestnuts!
Chestnuts!
Ding-dong, ding-dong.
- Is your brother expecting you?
- I'll tell him when I arrive.
Ah...! Ah...!
Get 'em off me!
Get them off me!
Get 'em off me, please!
Get 'em off!
Ah!
- Get it off!
- No, sir, no!
So, this is goodbye.
I really expected us to become good friends.
What's going on?
Sir! You dropped this!
Eh Tar.
Eh Tar.
He seemed to go mad! He snatched up a knife and stabbed himself!
Eh Tar, Holmes. Eh Tar.
Sir... No!
- Please, no!
- Holmes!
- I might have known.
- This is to do with...
Get these two schoolchildren away from here!
Mr Lestrade, you've got to listen to me!
Ho...! Ho!
Man that is born of a woman has but a short life...
A few days later, they buried Professor Waxflatter.
I had never been to a funeral before, though I've been to many since.
Holmes could not attend the funeral.
His expulsion prevented such a thing.
The death of his mentor and friend had taken its toll on Holmes.
In my life, I have only seen Holmes cry on two occasions.
Today was the first.
No, Uncle didn't kill himself.
- He didn't? Then, what happened?
- He was murdered.
- What are you doing here?
- Excuse my entrance.
I had to climb up the fire escape.
I can't afford to be seen.
I only got halfway to Mycroft's home.
I had something gnawing at my insides.
I ordered the driver to turn round.
I'm going to miss him, too, Elizabeth.
- He was very important to me.
- I'm so glad you're here.
I had to come back.
- You really believe he was murdered?
- I'm certain of it.
Come on, you saw
Waxflatter's hand on the knife!
It was obviously a suicide!
Never trust the obvious. There are too many puzzling elements.
Firstly, a man jumps out of a window.
Second, a reverend throws himself under a carriage for no reason.
Then Waxflatter stabs himself, which is unbelievable.
Another question. Why was Waxflatter obsessed with their deaths?
Yes, he'd saved those clippings, and he kept meeting that odd man.
He attended the funeral.
Do you know his name?
No. When he visited,
Uncle sent me out of the attic.
I asked about him, but he changed the subject.
That man is connected to all three murders. We must find out who he is!
You've been reading too many detective novels.
This is not fiction! There's a clever murderer about, and I'll find him.
- How?
- I'll live here. Work here.
- If that's all right with you.
- Yes.
- What if we're found?
- Only the three of us know.
- Someone may see you!
- I'll take my chances.
But you'll need food, supplies.
Me?! I can't...
You can run errands, be my assistant.
I might get caught.
That would mean trouble!
You'd let trouble ruin an opportunity for adventure?
I can't afford to jeopardise my medical career.
- Weasel.
- I'm not a weasel.
- I am practical.
- Weasels are practical.
And I imagined you courageous, stout of heart.
I am courageous.
And I'm stout of heart.
It's just that...
- All right, I'll do it.
- Thank you, Watson.
Uncle would have wanted you to have this.
Please.
Put it on.
On second thoughts, take it off.
It looks very silly. You can't wear hats.
I think it's very becoming.
- You're teasing.
- No, seriously.
The following day, we set out to solve Waxflatter's murder.
We had very little to go on.
We only had two clues:
Waxflatter's final words, "Eh Tar", and the dropped blowpipe.
It occurred to me that when the cloaked figure ran off,
I had heard a peculiar jingling sound,
very much like the sound
I heard in the library at Brompton.
Holmes was intrigued, and we decided to visit the library that night.
However, our first stop that day was at Engle's Curio Shop.
Nice. Oh, very nice.
Egyptian. The markings, the design, that's Egyptian craftsmanship.
- I've only seen this type once before.
- Where?
On jewellery, on sculptures.
I had it here in the shop.
- But I sold the lot.
- To whom?
An Egyptian.
Keeps some sort of tavern.
- And his name?
- Let's see...
Mm...
You promised to purchase something.
- Watson, buy something.
- Me?
- I'm short of funds right now.
- Rubbish.
Don't be a penny-pincher.
That address could lead us to our killer.
- How much do I need to spend?
- Buy anything!
Why on earth did you buy a pipe?
- It's distinguished.
- It's ridiculous.
You'll see. I shall learn to smoke it, then you can't laugh.
What can I get for you boys?
Drink, food, women?
- Do you have any soup?
- Watson, please.
Are you the owner?
Have you seen this before?
Rame Tep.
Rame Tep! Rame Tep!
Rame Tep!
- Is that the end of the song?
- Where...?
- Where did you get this?
- I happened upon it.
Go! Take it away! Get out of here!
It's very important.
Could you tell us something about this?
Get out of my tavern, or these words will be the last words you ever hear!
Sir...
We're leaving, we're leaving.
Up there, the top shelf.
That's where I heard the sound.
Holmes, please hurry. Do you know what happens when we're caught?
- Incredible!
- Holmes, your voice, keep it down!
Sorry, Watson.
- My God, that is remarkable!
- Holmes, please!
Oh, God. Oh, God.
What are my chances of medical school?
- That quaint office I've dreamed of...
- Listen. "The care to preserve..."
Holmes explained that the Rame Tep were fanatical followers of Osiris,
the Egyptian God of the Dead.
They were scorned because of their distortion of traditional beliefs,
and their violent and sadistic rituals.
The Rame Tep use a blowpipe and shoot a thorn into their victim.
The thorn is dipped into a solution made up of plant extracts.
Upon entering the bloodstream,
the solution causes the victim realistic, nightmare-like hallucinations.
- But we can be certain of one thing.
- What's that?
The murderer is still here... on school grounds.
That's a rash statement, since this jingling has been heard only once.
- Twice.
- Twice?
Remember a few nights ago in the courtyard?
Uncas heard a jingling sound like you described.
He took a piece of clothing from him.
It might still be here!
We must find that piece of clothing.
We sprang into action, searching every nook and cranny for the cloth.
I accidentally turned on one of Waxflatter's strange machines,
and I had the dickens of a time trying to turn the thing off.
I found it! I found it!
Holmes spent a night and day examining the section of cloth.
He conducted numerous experiments.
Not once did he rest.
His energy seemed boundless.
Following 18 straight hours of work,
Holmes turned to us, and those four familiar words shot from his lips:
The game is afoot!
He explained it was Egyptian in origin
and contained so many warp and weft threads, which I didn't understand.
The cloth was stained with paraffin made only at Froggit and Froggit,
located in Wapping in London, a dark and dangerous place,
and I told him so in no uncertain terms!
Perhaps we should come back in the morning when it's lighter, and when there are more people.
- It's open.
- Holmes, wait.
- What if the murderer's inside?
- Then I shall introduce myself.
I knew it, there's no one here.
Back to school, eh?
Watson, you'll be on your own.
What do you suppose it is?
Some sort of Egyptian artwork?
Some sort of statue?
No, Watson, I'm afraid this is only the tip of the iceberg.
Ah...!
Oh, no!
This is an interesting development.
There must be a passageway inside.
I hear chanting.
Holmes, there's a door here!
Fancy him missing a door.
Watson, Elizabeth, over here.
It's some sort of temple.
- I'm going down for a closer look.
- Let's get out of here alive!
Stay here,
I'll be back in a few minutes.
Stop! She's alive!
Get him! Get him!
Get him!
- Ah!
- Ah!
We got them!
Elizabeth!
Can you hear?
Elizabeth!
- What could have happened to her?
- Maybe she was hit by a thorn.
Aah...!
Elizabeth!
- I think I hear something.
- You're right.
Please! Please, Uncle! Don't!
Please! Help me! No!
- No...!
- Elizabeth!
- Help me tie her down.
- What with?
- My scarf! Quickly!
- I don't want to die!
- It's a hallucination!
- Help me!
It's not real! You're hallucinating!
Wake up!
- You've got to wake up! It's not real!
- No, Uncle!
- You're hallucinating. Listen to me!
- Please!
It's a hallucination! Elizabeth, listen to me! Now, Watson... Watson?
- Dear God, not Watson, too!
- Please!
Watson!
Watson!
Oh!
Get 'im, get 'im, get 'im!
No!
No!
Please don't cry, Mother. Please!
Don't you understand, Mother?
Can't you hear me?
Can't you hear what I'm saying?
Mother!
You! This is all your fault, son.
How could you do such a thing to me?
To your own father! Spying on me.
Forgive me, Father, please.
I didn't realise...
My private life is my own!
Your mother need never have known!
No, no, no! This is not real!
This is not real!
Argh!
This is not real!
It's just a hallucination.
It's only in my mind.
Maybe not!
No. Please, no!
Stay right there, or I'll blow your bleedin' heads off!
I've convinced him to drop the charges.
Holmes, you and your friends have cost me a night's sleep.
- Please, good morning.
- Mr Lestrade, these fanatics are responsible for numerous deaths.
I think they're responsible for the four girls who disappeared last month.
- I beg you, begin an investigation!
- Based on what, your imagination?
A great detective relies on perception, intelligence and imagination.
- Where'd you get that rubbish from?
- It's on the wall behind you.
Oh, gosh...
I don't see why I should explain my actions to you.
I've spent seven years at Scotland
Yard, analysing hundreds of cases.
With your background of school books and headlines, you consider you know more than me. I despise your arrogance!
- And I despise your laziness.
- Out! All of you. Simply leave.
If you have any investigative power in you at all, you'll test these.
- Maybe then you'll be convinced.
- Out, Holmes!
Oh!
Ow!
Blast.
Holmes, please stop that infernal tinkering.
- I have a headache.
- Tinkering helps me think.
- Sleep helps me think.
- There's no time for sleep!
We've got to find something to link Waxflatter with the Rame Tep.
- I've got a picture here.
- I want clues, not art critiques!
Clues. What do you think
I've been doing for the past hour?
Yes, Mr French Pastry, I have nothing whatsoever to say to you.
I trust you have nothing to say to me.
What have you done with that painting?
- You know what you've found?
- Waxflatter as a young man?
Not just that. Bentley Bobster,
Duncan Nesbitt, Rupert Waxflatter.
They've all died recently except this man, Chester Cragwitch!
He was here and at the funeral.
He's the only man here still alive!
This is the clue we've been looking for.
We're going to solve this crime.
Good show, Watson!
Holmes... I did not expect our foils to cross so soon.
- How did you know I was hiding?
- We share the same keen observation.
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- I shall be needing your assistance.
- Mr Holmes, I thought you'd gone.
- We were all under that impression.
Now, unfortunately, Mr Holmes is in a rather awful mess.
If the Board knew, they'd probably have you arrested and sent to prison.
But there's no need to tell the Board.
I'm willing to forget about this.
Tomorrow you go home, as planned.
- Watson, you will do the same.
- I'm being expelled?
The Board would summarily expel you.
This saves you any such disgrace.
Elizabeth, did you permit Mr Holmes to stay in your uncle's study?
- Yes.
- Oh, dear.
I find that extremely unladylike behaviour.
Indeed. May I suggest that we have the dog taken to the pound?
- What?
- Other schools do not allow pets.
You can't take him away!
Perhaps, in the circumstances,
I should take care of him myself.
Holmes, it grieves me that you've taken advantage of my friendship.
It is time to dispose of everything in the Waxflatter laboratory.
But, sir, it's filled with his inventions, drawings and experiments.
We mustn't cling to the past.
- It's his whole life!
- And his life is over.
- You have no right!
- Mr Holmes!
I'm surprised at your tone of voice, especially with me!
- I apologise. I got a bit carried away.
- Take your seat.
You'll have to stay overnight, it's too late to find transport.
Place the boys in 14B, and keep the young lady in your adjoining room.
Holmes.
Remember what I always taught you.
Control your emotions, or they will be your downfall.
Yes, sir.
Oh, I knew it.
It's the end of my medical career.
Father's going to be furious.
I suspected becoming your friend would end in disaster.
What are you doing?
Are you trying to get us arrested?
- We can leave now.
- I'm staying here.
Please, I need you, Watson.
We're in this together. We're a team.
Elizabeth, wake up!
- This is Chester Cragwitch.
- The man who visited Uncle.
- The one who ran from the funeral.
- Exactly.
Isn't it odd that he's the only surviving member of this group?
Go back to the laboratory and salvage as much as you can.
We'll meet you there.
First, we've got to get out of here.
- Watson.
- Yes.
Holmes.
Be careful tonight.
This is too much.
Go away, Rame Tep!
Bloody murderers, go away!
You won't get me!
Sir! Mr Cragwitch!
We were friends of Mr Waxflatter.
I know you. You're the youngster that followed me at the cemetery.
Go away! I'm a dangerous man to be around!
I need your help. I want to know why the Rame Tep killed five men.
Go in.
You can get up now, Watson.
The war's over.
We were to become business partners, all six of us.
We borrowed money from our fathers to build a hotel, the most luxurious hotel ever conceived.
And where better to build...
...than Egypt?
Labour and materials were cheap, and only a few years earlier, the British Army had driven out the
French. It was a land of opportunity.
- What happened?
- We engaged an architect and began.
But what started out as a business venture...
...soon became a major archaeological find.
We discovered an underground pyramid.
The ancient tombs of five Egyptian princesses.
We removed all the relics and treasures to send to England.
But... Oh!
Bloody insect.
Place needs a good cleaning.
There was an uproar.
The villagers were convinced we'd desecrated sacred ground.
Our lives were in danger.
The British sent the troops in, several people were killed.
The entire village was burned to the ground.
Burnt...
Fire!
Ah!
- Are you all right?
- Fire!
- Fire!
- They've hit Cragwitch with a thorn!
- I'm burning! Fire!
- Listen to me!
Your name is Chester Cragwitch, you're a banker. Can you hear me?
- Answer me, who are you?
- My name is Chester Cragwitch.
I reside at Cragwitch Manor,
Hampstead...
My God, it was so real.
Real, so very real...
Yes. I mustn't forget.
I must pass on this information.
It is time someone else knew.
- The village had burnt to the ground?
- Yes. Yes!
We got out of Egypt with our lives.
In England, we went separate ways, all of us keeping in touch with
Waxflatter through correspondence.
When the murders began,
I met frequently with my dear friend.
What about the Rame Tep?
A year after the incident, we all received this letter.
It was sent by a young boy of Anglo-Egyptian descent.
You'll notice the letterhead is adorned by the symbol of the Rame Tep, two golden serpents.
The boy and his sister were in England with their grandfather when they learnt of the destruction of the village which was their home.
Both their parents were killed in the attack.
The boy vowed that the Rame Tep would take their revenge and replace the bodies of the five Egyptian princesses.
- And the boy was called Eh Tar?
- Waxflatter's final words!
- Very good, Watson.
- Eh Tar!
You filthy murderer.
You wanted to kill all of us.
- Well, you won't kill me.
- Watson, speak to him!
What? Oh... Your name is Craggy Critch... Your name...
- Your name is... What's his name?
- Cragwitch...
Argh...!
Mr Lestrade!
- What are you doing here?
- I stuck myself with a thorn.
The hallucinations... Ghastly.
Took four policemen to stop me hanging myself.
So I thought
I'd better look into your story.
Now, I wish you and your podgy friend farewell.
I appreciate you getting me started on the case.
Getting him started on the case?
Lmagine that.
I've only done all the work for him.
- It's you!
- Yes, my dear.
Ah!
Aah...!
Mr Rathe, you must stop her, she's a murderer!
So, my dear, you've discovered our little secret.
Where are your two friends?
You'll never find them.
You'll never find them.
You'll never find them.
Never find them.
- What shall we do with her?
- She'll come with us.
We need the fifth princess.
Holmes, I know the answer to the riddle. The bear is white!
Good for you. Do you know why?
Well... No. It was the one colour
I didn't choose.
Keep thinking.
Answers without evidence are useless.
This riddle will give me a headache.
- Eh Tar... Eh Tar...
- Can't you think of anything else?
- It's necessary.
- It is annoying.
This silly bear puzzle, Holmes.
I can't work it out.
I know the bear is white, but I don't know why. I'm not stupid or anything.
Think the whole thing through.
Take it apart piece by piece.
Your face is bleeding again.
This cut from Rathe's ring never seems to heal.
The bear is white because...
- Oh, God! How could I be so stupid?
- What?
It's Rathe, Watson. It's Rathe!
Giddup!
Come on!
Faster!
Giddup! Giddup, there!
Rathe's got Elizabeth!
- There's only one way to catch them.
- How?
- Come on!
- Where are we going?
This is madness!
It's our only chance to get there in time.
Waxflatter worked on it until he died, and I've also done some tinkering.
Hopefully, the problems are sorted out.
Coming, Watson?
Oh, dear...
- What have I got myself into?
- The adventure of a lifetime.
Uncas, pull!
- It works, Watson, it works!
- We're flying!
- Would you believe it, Watson?
- We're flying!
Faster! Giddup!
Faster!
Holmes, down there!
Holmes, look out!
Ooh...!
My God, it's nearly half past twelve!
I've just realised I have no idea how to land this machine!
- Hold tight!
- I'm holding!
This time we're going to crash!
- Hurry, we're sinking back here!
- All right!
Oh!
Oh, my God, they're going to kill her.
Elizabeth.
Oh, Elizabeth.
I don't know what to do.
There are a hundred of them.
What can we do?
Perhaps we can apply something we learnt at school.
- For goodness' sake.
- I can't think of anything.
- Why don't you think of something?
- Watson, that's not helpful.
- Why can't I think of anything?
- You're flustered.
- Why can't you?
- I'm flustered!
Watson, I've got it.
- We must create a diversion.
- Create a diversion?
- Why didn't I think of that?
- If my geometry is correct, one beam misplaced will bring down this whole thing like a house of cards.
Watson, I've a plan.
Hurry, Holmes!
Holmes!
Aah...!
Argh...
Holmes...! Look out!
Holmes, are you all right?
Watson, get her out of here!
Aah!
Oh, no...
Holmes!
Rathe's taken Elizabeth and the stairs are blocked! What should I do?
Go around the other way!
You must stop him!
Holmes!
Holmes! Holmes! Holmes!
No!
What am I going to do?
No...!
Giddup! Ha!
Ya! Ya!
Aah...!
Good show.
- Elizabeth, are you all right?
- I think so.
Please...
- What are we going to do about Rathe?
- Where is he?
He's gone.
The police will find him.
- Elizabeth...
- Strange...
Strange.
Let's just go back now.
I don't know how
I'll explain this to my parents.
It'll all be explained in tomorrow's papers.
- Will you be allowed back to school?
- I don't know. Perhaps.
- Holmes!
- No!
Damn!
Ah...!
- Put my coat around her.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to get him.
- You'll be killed!
Eh Tar.
You're nothing but a damned fraud!
And you are letting your emotions get the better of you again.
You cannot best me.
Throw down your sword.
- Never. I'd rather die a horrible death.
- Very well. Then I will oblige.
Come, is this the best you can do?
You fight like a child! I've already won!
You've lost every battle, this will be no exception.
All your dreams have been shattered!
Everything has been destroyed forever!
Ha...! Ha...! Ha...!
Ha...!
Elizabeth... Elizabeth.
Yes, Holmes, let's tarry a while longer, as your Elizabeth's precious lifeblood flows from her body.
Argh...!
Elizabeth, come on.
Wake up. Open your eyes.
Elizabeth... Elizabeth.
Holmes.
Don't be sad.
Someday, we'll be reunited.
In another world. A much better world.
I'll be waiting.
And you'll be late... as always.
Elizabeth... No.
No.
Elizabeth.
Goodbye.
You'd think he'd uncovered the entire case on his own.
That's what he wanted the Yard to believe.
What other reason would they have for promoting him? Bye, Uncas.
Stay there, Uncas,
I'll be back in a minute.
You know, Holmes, a few things still haunt me.
Why did you suspect Rathe was involved with the Rame Tep?
When Waxflatter retired, the Board wanted him to leave.
Rathe argued until he convinced the Board to let Waxflatter remain.
I could never understand why Rathe wanted Waxflatter to stay.
He liked Waxflatter's inventions?
What's wrong with you? Have you been asleep through this entire case?
Sorry.
Holmes explained that Rathe spent years plotting his revenge.
He established himself as a respected member of society,
completely erasing his former identity.
It took a long time to organise his followers,
made up of the poor, the homeless, the lost souls of the streets.
Also, it took time to build a wooden replica of the pyramid.
Mrs Dribb was the Rame Tep's chief assassin,
but, more importantly, she was Rathe's younger sister.
Amazing, Holmes, simply amazing.
- You did forget one important clue.
- Oh? Please enlighten me.
- "Rathe" is "Eh Tar"' spelt backwards.
- Very clever, Watson.
I would have seen that sooner or later.
Sooner or later. Are you coming back after the holidays?
No, I'll transfer.
There are too many memories here.
- You have your entire life ahead of you.
- And I'll spend it alone.
Merry Christmas, Holmes.
I thought you might have more luck smoking it.
- Well?
- Seems to suit you. But that coat...
Why do you wear that ridiculous cloak of that unspeakable person?
Consider it a trophy.
The skin of a leopard.
- Indeed.
- I'm going to miss you, Watson.
I'm going to miss you too, Holmes.
- You were right about something.
- What?
It was the adventure of a lifetime.
- Wait! I know why the bear's white!
- Why is that?
A room with an all-southern view is on the North Pole. It's a polar bear!
Bravo. You have the makings of a great detective.
As I watched Holmes settle in, a sudden feeling came over me,
that I would most certainly be seeing him again.
So ended my first adventure with Mr Sherlock Holmes.
As I watched his carriage disappear,
I realised that I'd forgotten to thank him.
He'd taken a weak, frightened boy and made him into a courageous man.
My heart soared. I was ready for whatever mystery or danger lay ahead.
I was ready to take on the greatest adventure of them all.
And I knew it was bound to involve Sherlock Holmes. subs by tarun
- Can I help you?
- I'd like a room, please.
Please, sir, to sign here.
Which one?
Which one will it be?
"Although we all must sometimes stumble...
"as we journey through this life...
"l never heard you moan or grumble.
"The perfect mother...
"and wife."
Terribly sorry, sir!
I do beg your pardon.
Why the devil don't you look where you're going?
I'm terribly sorry.
Hello!
Fancy bumping into you!
-What?
-Wow!
Well, you're the last person
I expected to see.
What are you talking about?
Oh, you've forgotten me, haven't you?
I don't know you from Adam!
Oh, I know it's been a long time.
Goodness, yes! How time flies.
Surely you recall, sir.
We met at the uh... the what's it...the uh... the um...
What's my name?
Pardon?
My name!
What then is my name?
Don't you know your name?
Fancy not knowing your own name.
Bloody fool!
Don't know who you are, but I know what you are.
You're a pig! Piggy!
Pig, pig, pig!
Piggy!
Oh! I beg your pardon.
Oh, no. My fault.
-My fault.
-Oh, thank you.
Excuse me.
Good heavens!
-What is it?
-Well, well!
How are you?
Oh, um...hello.
You've forgotten me, haven't you?
No, no, it's not that. it's just that l...
Well, yes, I have, as a matter of fact.
Anyway, how are you?
Yes, yes.
It's been such a long time.
Goodness, uh...
-Long time, yes.
Yes, a long time.
You still at the same place?
-At the Evangelist Press.
-No, no, I meant um...
Oh, uh...Puddle Mear, yes.
Puddle Mear, dear me!
Still there, then?
Same old house.
A bit too big for us now, of course.
Uh, you must be--
Got it?
A friend of Patricia's?
There, you've placed me now, haven't you.
How is dear...Patricia?
Well, of course... she'll never be... well, we've got her at home now... and we do our best for her.
Oh, I'm sure you do.
Of course you do.
Well, I must be trotting along.
It's nice to meet you again.
Taylor, Martin Taylor.
Remember?
Oh, yes, I seem to remember
Patricia mentioning you.
It was the art college, wasn't it?
It's quite appalling... how people lose contact, isn't it?
Yes.
There's so many things
I remember.
I'd very much like to see her again.
See her!
Well, you know, just to talk over--
She can't talk.
Oh. I...
We thought she would after the accident.
The doctors said she might.
But uh...
Oh, my God.
Well, I thought you knew.
I thought you said you were a friend of hers.
-I've been away.
-For 3 years?
America--I went to study the arts.
The American Realists.
I thought you knew.
Most of her friends abandoned her, of course.
I'm not a fair-weather friend.
I only heard about the accident uh...
Steady.
I say...
Are you--oh. I...
Look, sit down over here.
I say, are you all right down there?
Miss, look, can you give me a hand please?
Don't try to move him.
Put a handkerchief in his mouth.
We were just talking.
Loosen his collar or something.
He was just talking to me and he just... went over.
No, no, not necessary.
I just--
Don't want you to bite your tongue.
Thank you!
Get him back as quickly as possible.
I should get him home.
Don't go rushing about now.
Take it very gently.
Well, well, young man... whatever am I going to do with you, eh?
Do you think... a piggyback...
What?
A piggyback.
Well, I'm not a... how far?
As far as the car park.
I've got to get a taxi, you see.
Oh, a taxi, yes.
To take me back to the station.
The station.
Look, I do apologize, my...oh.
Look, I can't just bung you in a taxi.
No, of course not.
Look, can you walk at all?
Walk...
Look, my car's just round the corner, you see.
I'll tell you what...
I'll bring the car around to the edge of the park.
Yes. That's it.
I'll bring it round to the back of the cathedral.
You just stay here, old man.
You just wait there.
I won't be a moment.
I've got him.
Bastard! Bastard!
How stupid, Mister...
Bates.
Mr. Thomas Ezekiel Bates.
I'm very sorry, Tom.
I did try, you know. Really.
It doesn't help us when you can't be bothered.
Patty was very difficult this afternoon.
And I had this terrible headache, Tom... just as if there was... a stone rolling around inside my brain.
Your what?
I do work quite hard, you know.
I wrote 69 "in memoriam" verses this afternoon.
It's not entirely unreasonable... to expect a cooked meal when I get in, is it?
So, is it?
Please don't raise your voice, Tom.
After all, this isn't the first time... this has happened, is it?
It's the second, actually.
More than that.
Please don't raise your voice, Tom... it upsets Patty.
Oh, don't be foolish.
How can she tell which--
She knows, Tom.
She knows what goes on.
She knows when you're angry... and when I'm sad.
That's... that's not possible.
Listen to her then.
That's horrible.
No.
What do you mean, Tom?
It's horrible.
Horrible--I mean... if she understands more than she can tell us.
Oh, but she can.
I'm sure of it.
It's horrible. Horrible.
No, Tom, it's a sign of improvement.
The doctors don't know everything.
Don't.
Oh, it's all right.
Hush, darling, I'm here.
To be cooped up... caged up inside your own head...
-and be unable--
-Don't, Tom.
It's like having an anesthetic... so that you're completely paralyzed... as far as everyone else is concerned.
But they all think you're out--right out-- but all the time you can hear what they're saying.
No, Tom, it's not like that.
All the time you can see the knife in the surgeon's hands.
And no matter what they do... or however much it hurts... you can't scream... or cry out.
Or... it's horrible.
Tom!
I don't want this.
I don't want to eat this.
I just want to be sick!
I spend much more time with Patty than you do... and I notice many more little things.
I think there's a different sort... of expression in her eyes nowadays... there's a light from inside.
A definite light.
What are you talking about?
A light?
I know what I mean.
A light-- a definite human light.
Something inside her is trying to speak to us.
Patricia has gone from us, Norma.
She's gone forever.
You must accept that.
Who knows?
What?
When you look outside... into the dark... into the garden... you know that... well... this little box is not all there is.
What are you going on about?
Nothing you would understand.
Norma...
I used to believe.
It's my business, in a manner of speaking--
God and all that.
But now, l...
We must keep our faith.
No. I no longer accept... there's such a thing as a loving God, Norma.
If he's there, then he's just a cruel beast... a vicious old bugger.
Tom!
There is no God.
There is no hope for Patty.
There are no such things as miracles.
I'll make your coffee.
I won't be a minute, Patty.
Don't do that.
Please, don't do that.
Oh, but I will!
It's wicked to act as though she's not here.
Norma, listen to me, please.
And wicked, wicked, very wicked... to say that... that she has gone from us forever.
One man went to mow
Went to mow a meadow
One man and his
Dog
Did you like that, Patty?
I used to rock you to sleep with that one.
You've gone.
You've gone, my love... far, far away.
There are miracles, Tom.
They can come at any time... and at any place.
Who could that be?
Only one way to find out.
Don't go.
Don't go, Norma.
-Don't open it.
-Why ever not?
Good evening.
Can I help you?
Why don't you come in?
This way, please.
Aah.
Tom, what on Earth...?
Hello, Mr. Bates.
So we meet again, eh?
I-I am...
Oh, do you know my husband then, Mr.--
Uh, yes--that is, sort of.
What are you doing with that?
Oh, it's your wallet, Tom.
You dropped it. I found it.
By the cathedral.
Isn't that nice of the young man, Tom... to bring it all the way out here?
Did you have any money in it, sir?
What? Oh, yes. £80.
Oh, don't be alarmed.
This is Patricia, our daughter.
She--
The young man used to be a friend of Patty's, Norma... at the art college.
Oh.
Must be a terrible shock for you to see her in this condition.
Hello.
Hello, again, my dear, darling Patricia.
Don't be a fool!
She can't understand you.
She--
Oh, my dear, darling.
Oh, my fallen angel.
I've waited so long.
So very long for this one single moment.
Love and pity... and grace and beauty.
What are you doing?
That is... oh, I think that is... the loveliest thing
I've ever heard.
It's gone, the money's gone!
Oh, dear, dear, what a shame.
Well, where is it? £80!
Tom!
No one likes to lose money, Mrs. Bates.
You're lucky the credit cards weren't stolen, sir.
You're supposed never to leave home without them.
Yeah, that's all very well, but I've--
Oh, none of that matters.
I didn't know when I asked you in... that you knew Patricia,
Mister...
Taylor. Martin Taylor.
Do you recall the name, dear?
It must have been taken when I collapsed.
Collapsed?
Yes, dear, he uh...
With all those people sort of huddling around me...
I didn't like the look of that clergyman, so-called.
I bet he took your wallet.
You collapsed?
That's--
Yes, I did suggest he came home with me, dear, but he--
Oh, yes, he was very insistent.
Well, I'm very glad you're here now.
Aren't you, Tom?
Oh, yes, indeed.
It's very good of you to bring this back... even without the money.
Tom.
Would you care for a cup of coffee...
Mister--
Oh, please, call me Martin.
Would you, Martin?
It's just been made.
Well, that would be very nice if it's not any trouble.
No, not any trouble at all.
Oh, bring a cloth, too, will you dear... to mop up the mess I made.
Oh, let me do that.
Oh, good heavens, no.
Whatever next?
It's just that l...
I love housework.
I think it's, well, such a peaceful art.
Oh, tell that to my husband.
I'm sorry I gave you such a start, sir.
Oh, no. I couldn't--uh...
I couldn't get the car started.
You know, not for ages... there's been some...
Well, you better sit down then, Martin.
Thank you very much.
Here we are, then.
Well, isn't this nice!
Just what I needed.
Did you get the cloth, dear?
Yeah--oh, my!
I'm all at sixes and sevens.
-Oh, let me!
-Please stay where you are.
But I just told Mrs. Bates you'll be feeling rather tired.
I'll get it.
Thank you, dear.
What's his game, then?
What's he up to?
Mmm! Superb flavor, this coffee.
Oh, good.
It's not instant, you see.
The color alone indicates that.
Didn't see the damn thing.
It's on the draining board, dear.
I can't stand stains.
Oh, either can l, sir!
Or dirt of any description.
Did you know Patty very well, Mister-- uh, Martin?
What can I say, l--
Yes, well, I'll just take this back... to the place where it's supposed to be.
I suppose it's a painful question.
I thought the world of her, madam. I really did.
But you sort of...
Iost touch, did you?
Think I could deserve another cup of coffee now?
I've been in the United States of America.
Oh, I see.
So, you didn't know about...
No.
And how long is it... since you've been back, then?
Two days, sir.
And you say you recognized me when you cannoned into to me.
That's correct, sir.
Superb flavor, this coffee, if I may say so.
Thank you.
Would you mind telling me when it was we last met?
-What?
-And where?
Do you mean to say you only pretended to remember me, sir?
I don't know why you're questioning Martin like this.
Patty's not exactly in a position to say... whether she knows the young man or not, is she, dear?
What on Earth are you talking about?
Really, Tom!
She knows I'm here.
She knows.
Don't be ridiculous.
She can't possibly be aware--
We don't know enough about the human mind.
None of us know enough... about what goes on inside the head, do we?
-Or the heart, Mrs. Bates.
-We have to face reality.
We have to see things as they really are.
Do you think I want to?
They never did find the driver, you know.
Oh?
Hit and run, you see.
It was raining.
He should be hung up on a steel rope... and cut down while still alive!
It was 4 years ago last Tuesday fortnight.
All I hope is that whoever did it... dies full of cancer screaming his head off.
Absolutely, sir... at the very minimum.
Yes, it was very kind of you to return my wallet... but if you want to get back into town at anything like... a reasonable hour...
Yes, yes, of course.
Oh, but you haven't finished your coffee.
Oh, I have almost, and greatly appreciated it was.
Oh, is anything wrong?
Did Patty never mention me to you?
No.
Well, of course Patty had so very many friends... from school, the art college, the tennis club.
It's just that
I wasn't simply... one of her many friends though.
Well, of course, we don't remember every single name... she talked about.
She knew so many people.
She was such a lively, friendly girl.
She and l, we...
It doesn't matter very much one way or the other, does it?
Not now.
You and she were...what?
I can't say with total confidence... exactly what I was to her, sir.
She can't speak for herself... and so I must be scrupulously honest in this house, but...
Go on.
But as for what I felt...
I thought she was the most exquisite being... in the entire universe.
And yes-- oh, yes, she will always be for me... the girl all the songs sing about... the girl with eyes like fallen stars--
You don't know-- you can't know... what you're saying.
Perhaps he does, Tom.
Would you let me stay with her?
Stay?
-Oh, that's not possible.
-How do you mean, Martin?
The plain truth is...
I once dared to ask Patricia to be my bride.
Oh!
And she?
-She turned me down.
-I'm not altogether surprised.
Tom, how very rude.
To be more accurate, sir... she asked me to wait 4 or 5 years... until my prospects had improved.
Or until she'd had time to put her thoughts in order.
You mean she--
Well, she never told us anything of this.
-lsn't that surprising?
-To me? Yes, it is.
But she was fond of you, was she, Martin?
She said so, and I believed so.
I loved her.
I always will.
But you never wrote... when you were in America.
We agreed not to communicate... until the period of separation and consideration was finished.
But now that you've seen her... seen how terrible...
Now that I've seen her...
I know at last that... a certain peace--
Peace?
Peace... a quietude that falls upon a soul... when it meets and recognizes... ordained destiny.
Sit down, Martin.
Thank you.
Now, let's get things in order, shall we?
I think that would be very sensible.
These romantic declarations... about love and destiny, you know... they don't necessarily signify--
What do you mean precisely "stay"?
-What do you hope to do?
-Help.
To help.
Look here, old son, we don't know anything about you... not the first thing.
I mean, you could be the devil himself, for all we--
I'm sure you're a very nice young man, Martin.
Tell me... do you have a nurse or anything to see to Patty?
-I wish we did.
-It's not necessary.
Oh, hush, darling.
There's a good girl.
So, you wash her, Mrs. Bates... and feed her, and clothe her?
Yes, and lift her and clean up her...
Yes, I do it all.
-I lend a hand, too, of course.
You're out at your work.
-This is a private matter, dear.
-We never go out, Tom, now.
Not ever.
I feel as though I'm scraping my nails on the lid.
-What lid?
-The lid of my coffin.
Why do we have to be so bloody melodramatic?
-lt will kill you, Mrs. Bates.
-Now, look!
I presume you go shopping?
I wish I could go shopping.
I wish I could go anywhere.
We can't leave Patty, and Tom won't let me get any help.
People are far more cruel and calculating... than you think they are.
You never know what they're up to.
Not today, you don't.
My husband has always been a little... well, reclusive.
But he's very kind.
Oh, I'm sure he is.
But I have to admit...
I'm practically at the end of my tether.
Norma, dear...
We... we live in the shadows,
Mr. Taylor.
And we can see no light.
Then let me stay.
What? For the night, you mean?
A few days.
Oh, yes.
Where would he sleep, dear?
There's one bed already made up.
I always make it up every day.
Oh, Norma, no, I don't think so.
Patricia's old room.
Oh, that would be--
I can't tell you what that would mean to me...
Patricia's old room.
Thank you!
What about your things?
Oh, my things.
Where are you living now?
In a hotel in town.
A very dreary place.
More what you'd call a boarding house.
Well, I mean, your things.
Well, I can scrape along without them for one night.
Just lend me a toothbrush, eh?
Well, I'm sure we can find you something, Martin.
Great, well, I'll just wash up these cups--
Oh, there's no need for that.
I can soon do it, Martin.
You stay where you are, Mumsy.
What did you say?
Mumsy.
That's what I thought you said.
That's how I think of you now, Mrs. Bates.
I hope you don't mind too much.
No.
The kitchen, no doubt, is through here.
Yes.
One man went to mow
Went to mow a meadow
One man and his dog
Went to mow the meadow
Two men when to mow
Went to mow the meadow
Two men, 1 man...
It's almost as though she's trying to tell us she's pleased.
Might as well say she's trying to warn us.
Don't be silly, Tom.
Warning us?
About what, for heaven's sake?
Daddy!
I saw you, daddy, I saw you!
Listen, listen--
Oh, daddy, how could you?
And with that woman!
When you're older--
And with that woman!
About human suffering... and human disappointment...
Please, no.
Daddy.
Daddy!
What...what is it, dear?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
That is a good boy.
-Good morning!
-Oh!
Oh, you startled me.
I did knock, but...
I thought you'd like a cup of tea.
Tea, yes. Thank you.
You know I had the strangest dream.
Oh, I hope the bed was not to blame.
No... it was beautifully comfortable actually.
You didn't have sugar in your coffee last night... so I didn't put any in.
No sugar, good.
Superbly brewed.
We don't use tea bags, you see.
Oh, I can tell.
I can tell you're not that sort of lady at all.
Did you like the room?
I've kept it just as Patty left it.
Do you know I can--
I can feel her presence... her personality in every detail.
She was such a lovely girl.
Was, Mrs. Bates?
Oh, I mean...
Is, Mrs. Bates.
Shall I call you Mumsy?
Oh, oh, well...
You see, my own dear mother is... passed on to that far distant shore.
Sorry?
She's safe in the arms of Jesus.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is Mr. Bates, is he gone... or is he still here?
Yes.
Yes, he's just gone.
He's...
Worried about leaving you alone in the house with me, was he?
Well...
You told him not to be such a silly-billy, didn't you?
He was very worried this morning about... well, about what he said to you last night.
About God.
Oh?
He always talks too much when he's had a glass of sherry.
It's partly to get at me, too, of course... his not believing in God.
But he doesn't really want... people to know about it... because it would damage his business, you see.
You tell Mr. Bates not to worry.
I won't breathe a word to a living soul.
He publishes hymns... and evangelical prayers, you understand-- and those little verses of comfort... for the bereaved.
Mr. Bates has nothing to worry about.
Nothing at all.
Except his soul.
Yes, of course.
His soul.
Hey, what's the matter with...
Cheap little slut.
Well, what are we doing today then, Mumsy?
Pardon?
More to the point, what are you going to do?
Me? Oh...
Stroll around the shops?
Have your hair done? You choose.
Well, l...but I can't go out.
You can't go out?
What do you mean you can't go out?
I mean Patty-- she's asleep now... but she can't be left.
Then why am I here?
You? Well, you can't--
I'm quite capable of looking after Patty.
You just show me what to do, eh?
Oh, I don't think...
No problem, lovey.
No problem at all.
I don't think Tom would like it.
Tom isn't here, though, is he?
We'll talk about it later, shall we... when you've had some breakfast... and got your things.
Yes, my things.
Don't let your tea get too cold.
No. No, I won't. Thank you.
It's very nice tea.
If you like that sort of thing.
Memories are so sweet on the mind...
Although you've gone beyond...
They tell me of...
They tell me of...
Mr. Bates?
Mr. Bates, sir?
Miss Holdsworth, what is it?
I'm extremely busy.
I'm very sorry, sir.
I...
I thought you wanted me.
Want you? Want you?
What on Earth do you mean?
Want you?
I didn't meant to interrupt, sir.
I beg your pardon.
Miss Holdsworth?
Sir?
Raise your skirt, please.
-Valerie.
-Sir.
You are an extremely salacious... and corrupt Jezebel... and thank you very much.
She doesn't exactly chew, you see.
And she doesn't swallow.
Well, not precisely... but it gets down somehow or other.
I see, so you just get a spoonful... inside her mouth and...and wait.
Yes, but I don't really expect you to--
Go on, Mumsy.
Go out for an hour.
Give yourself a break.
Well, l...it doesn't seem--
You know you want to.
Well, perhaps if I just went... and had a shampoo and set.
Be a treat for you.
My hair...
You can never do it properly yourself...
-I don't think.
-Of course you can't.
And she is very quiet today.
I'm sure you can manage, Martin.
It would be nice to get out of the house.
Of course I can manage.
Would you have it cut, too?
-My hair?
-Mmm.
Just a wee bit shorter so as not to spoil... the contours of your face.
You've got a very pretty face, you see.
Oh, was once, perhaps.
Not anymore.
No. It's a very pretty face... you just need to take more care of yourself, that's all.
I will go for a little while.
That's a good girl.
Yeah, oh, I better do the beds first.
Oh, no, you don't.
Come on, ducky.
Out through the front door.
-Don't dillydally.
-But, Martin...
You'll be just fine, you'll see.
Well, l...Ieave her face.
I have washed her, and she has been changed.
You seem frightened of going out.
That's what comes of being housebound for so long.
Gets to be a disease.
People in hospitals, they get where they can't go out.
They have to force themselves.
You're a very kind and considerate young man.
And you are one of the kindest... bravest ladies in the land.
-Ooh, the dish.
-Ohh, the dish.
Bye-bye, Martin.
Bye, Patty.
Bye.
Come on, then, my lovely.
It's time for eaty-weaties.
Then I'll have a good snoop around the old homestead, eh?
There, there, my ickle-wickle baby.
Ick. Dirty ickle girl.
Daddy will have to smack your botty, won't he?
Smack your pretty little bum.
Banana.
Don't fret, baby.
There, there, my ickle-wickle pudding pie.
Patricia.
Let daddy see boo-boos, then.
Let daddy see them ickle-wickle boo-boos.
Yeah.
Would you like a coffee?
-Coffee?
Yes, please. Thank you.
Now that you've left me all alone... the days are so cold and so dank.
I recall the sunshine... sunshine....Iaughter.
I recall the laughter...
Beautiful.
You're beautiful.
Oh, you made me jump.
What are you doing up there?
I've made the beds.
Oh, you haven't.
You didn't expect me not to, did you?
Some fun that would be to go out and come back... and find everything left to do.
That was very sweet of you.
Your hair!
What's the matter with it?
It's amazing.
You look years younger.
-Do you like it?
-Like it? I'll say I do.
It's splendiferous.
I must say, I do feel better.
When you want to cast aside your care
Go and have a shampoo for your hair
Oh, Martin, you're atomic.
-Oh, dear.
-What's the matter?
Well, I like it, but I don't know what Tom will say.
Does it really matter what dear old Tom says?
Well, after all, he is my husband.
Oh, anyway, of course he'll like it.
So, you coped all right with Patty, did you?
Oh, yes, she was as good as gold, God bless her.
Hello, darling. Mommy's here.
What is it?
She looks...different.
Different?
There's a light in her eye.
A real sense of...
Let me see.
Tom won't have it, he won't believe me... but look at her.
I think there are signs.
Definite signs.
There's more going on in her head than anyone knows.
Do you say your prayers, Mumsy?
Every night, every morning, and 1,000 times in-between.
So do l.
Poor Martin.
Amore omnia vincit.
What?
Love conquers all.
Oh, I wish it did.
Oh, but it does.
The only chance Patty has now... the one thing which no doctor, no x-ray machine... no tricky dicky psychiatrist, none of them... none of them can ever detect the holy presence... and the deep sacred pulse of love.
Sweet love.
Love? Oh, yes.
Pure, absolute, undefiled love.
The sole lord of life.
The only adequate measure of almighty God.
The secret language of the angels.
You speak so beautifully, Martin.
I speak the truth... and the truth is always beautiful.
She seems so quiet, so content... as though she'd heard what you said.
Come on, then, Mumsy.
I'll make us both a nice cup of tea, eh?
-Thank you.
-Sit down. Relax.
-Put your feet up. Come on.
-I'm in such a tiz today.
I don't know whether
I'm coming or going.
That's because you've been locked away... for such a long time.
I have. Oh, yes, I have.
Well, that's over now... for as long as you want me here.
Oh, Martin, the angels must have sent you.
I feel as though
I'm in the middle... of a wonderful dream.
Yes, but--but when will it end?
Mr. Bates...he won't want me here, will he?
Well, when he sees what you do for me... how kind and how decent you are... but surely, Martin... you can't or don't want to stay... more than a day or two, do you?
I want to be with Patricia.
That's all I know.
I think I'm going to cry.
Don't cry... or else I will, too.
Drop a bomb. Drop a bomb.
Wipe us all out.
Destroy us one and all.
What did you say?
Well, you are so good with words... but I don't really like to ask.
Please do.
Earlier on, you... you asked me if I said my prayers.
Go on.
And I do. Of course I do... but I never feel
I say them properly.
I never find the... anything like the right words... and these things need to be expressed properly... don't they?
Out of respect for God.
Do you mean you want me to say a prayer?
Would you?
Oh, would you, Martin?
Yes, if you want me to.
You don't mind?
No. Of course not.
I'll kneel down, shall l...by Patty.
I'll kneel with you.
When shall we 3 meet again... in thunder, lightning, or in rain?
Almighty God, dear gentle father in heaven... who sees all and knows all and loves all... for the little sparrow falling in the sky... to the deepest chambers of the puzzled human heart... help us to understand the mystery... of pain and suffering.
Help us to see that the misery... of the least of thy creatures is but a part... of thy infinitely complex mercy... and limitless compassion.
Show us the pain and anguish for those... who bear them closer to thy gentle being.
Reach out, O Lord, in thy holy mercy... and touch this innocent young girl... the loveliest of thy creatures.
She cries out in the long, dark night of her soul... and we who love her... can neither hear nor understand.
Please, oh, please, God.
Only you can hear, O God.
Only you.
Show us the pain and anguish... bring those who bear them closer to thy gentle being.
Reach out, O Lord, in thy holy mercy... and touch this innocent young girl... the loveliest of thy children... who cries out in the long, dark night of her soul... and we who love her on this earth... can neither hear nor understand.
Only you, O God, only you can once again... present to her the warmth of a joyous life... an innocent world, the sunshine of laughter... and the grace of intelligence.
Sing "amen."
What? Oh, yes.
One, two...
Amen
Oh, that was lovely,
Martin. Lovely.
My mother taught me never to underestimate... the power of prayer.
Ohh...oh, I don't seem to be able to get up.
I'm not as fit as I was.
Come and sit down.
Take it easy for a bit.
Your shoes.
-lt must be all the excitement.
The hairdresser and your lovely prayer.
Did you like it?
It made the top of my head go all funny.
Tingly.
Well, that's the presence of things we don't understand.
Oh, goodness. The time.
I must see to the cooking.
Tom only had sandwiches last night.
Have you got any eggs?
-What?
-Eggs.
Oval steroids deposited from the vagina of a domestic fowl.
Yes, there are some eggs.
I shall cook the lightest, fluffiest... most delicious omelet you've ever tasted.
You?
Yes, me. Why not?
Oh, what a wonderful husband you would have made for Patty.
I saw you, Daddy, I saw you!
That's horrible, Daddy!
How could you? How could you?
-When you're older--
-And with that woman!
When you're older, you'll understand a bit more.
A bit more.
A bit more about human suffering... and human disappointment and frustration.
Not bad. Not bad at all.
I told you so, Tom.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Why can't you make eggs taste like this?
Martin's going to show me, aren't you, Martin?
Mmm. One of these days.
Did you collect your things, Martin?
My things, yes. Um...
Martin fed Patty this morning, Tom.
Fed her? Martin did?
And you let him?
And he made the beds, cooked the food... dusted the furniture... scrubbed the kitchen floor... and put fresh flowers everywhere.
Your hair!
-What about it?
You've had it done.
Oh, Tom...
You mean you went out... and left Patty with...
I looked after her, sir.
Yes, but--
I regarded it as a great privilege, sir.
I want to help look after Patty.
You didn't, uh...wash her or...or change her, did you?
Of course not, Tom.
That wouldn't be wrong, though, would it, sir?
Well, she's a young woman, and you are a young man.
I don't imagine for a moment.
Her brain may be damaged, but her body is that... of an attractive young woman.
What if I was a doctor or a male nurse, even?
That would be different, but you're not, are you?
I see.
I don't think Tom means--
Tom does. Tom certainly does.
Oh, I get it. I get it.
Someone who loves her, cares about her... who would give up everything for her... is somehow less trustworthy than some doctor... or even an overworked... and possibly quite callous nurse?
Is that what you're saying, sir?
That's not what
I said at all.
Then what did you mean, Tom?
He means it would be indecent for me... to see her poor, innocent body;, obscene for me to help her life more comfortable;, and lewd and disgusting to--
Martin, are you all right?
I'm not suggesting anything like that at all.
Good gracious, me.
Are you saying
I should be locked up... put away in an asylum?
I didn't think you had that sort of mind, Tom.
How could you?
How could you!
Christ almighty.
If you drive him away,
I shall never forgive you.
Don't you speak to me like that.
Hello, my lovely.
You don't know what it's like being cooped up in an office... day in and day out.
You've no idea the hell on Earth
I've been living.
-Please don't exaggerate.
-Exaggerate?
And please don't shout.
Don't you yell at me, Mr. Bates.
-Norma...
-Listen to me for once.
Today has been the happiest day I've had... in 4 horrible, horrible years.
-Stop it, please.
-No, I will not.
This is the first time in all these months...
I've felt this great stone in my head... and on my chest even begin to lift... and all because of that young man out there... whom you so offended with your filth.
Filth? Now, come on!
Filth! Yes, filth!
How could Martin even think the things you suggest?
A nice young man who says his prayers.
You ought to be ashamed.
Prayers?
What on Earth are the good of prayers?
Tom, will you think what you're saying?
Your whole business is based on faith and hope... and you don't know a thing about it.
I know what I'm saying!
What can prayers do for Patty?
What have they done for Patty?
More than any other single thing on this Earth.
What?! Pray to a God who maims young girls?
Pray to a God who lets cats torture mice... and men torture women... and stops his ears to the screams... and the moans and the torments?
You are a--Tom... you're a very, very wicked man.
You--how dare you say such a--
I've had my eyes open to a few things around here.
What? By that bloody little creep?
Your...Ianguage!
What's his game, eh?
What's he up to?
He has no game.
He isn't up to anything.
Well, he might con you, but he won't con me.
I'll tell you that!
I'm not going to sit here and listen to this.
For goodness sake--
Yes, and that's why he's here... for goodness sake.
Mumsy!
And I might have been... if Patty had had the sense to accept his proposal.
She wouldn't have looked twice at a mealy-mouthed... pasty-face ninny like him.
That's near enough the truth, sir.
But she did promise to think it over.
Patty did respect me, sir.
You can be sure of that.
I can't pretend I was ever the answer to her dreams.
Oh, Martin, he didn't--
One--one says the wrong thing now and again.
It's heat of the moment.
I'll go, I'll go tonight.
-It's perfectly all right.
-No, no, don't go.
How can I stay when Mr. Bates... mistrusts and even dislikes me so?
It's not fair on the head of the household, is it?
Oh, Tom...
I'm not saying I mistrust you.
Or--well, it's just that we don't really... know anything about you.
No, Norma, that's the truth.
It really is.
You were just the same with Patty's friends... when she was--just the same.
I was not.
Always cross-examining them.
Always trying to make them feel uncomfortable.
Always laying down the law.
Nonsense! I was just being her father.
Saying what she could wear and what she couldn't wear.
Oh, well, up to a-- yes, up to a point.
Up to a point!
Even down to her underwear.
I--I just wanted her to be decent, that's all.
You know what, Martin?
He even used to examine her brassieres.
I did not!
Yes, you did!
I saw you.
I saw you checking on her things.
I don't--I was--look--
I was just being her father.
Then why are you so embarrassed, sir?
Keep out of this, you!
Don't talk to our guest like that.
Don't be so rude, Tom.
Norma, why don't you shut your bloody, stupid mouth?
Norma, Norma,
Norma, look, I'm--
That wasn't very clever, was it, sir?
Patty. Oh, Patty.
If only you knew.
Norma, listen...
I'm very sorry.
I think you are the cruelest bully!
Now, now, Mrs. Bates,
I'm sure he didn't mean it.
You're both a bit overwrought, that's all.
You see how thoughtful he is?
-Oh, my God.
-Don't shout, Mr. Bates.
You know it disturbs your daughter.
She--I'm not shouting!
Yes, you are!
Patty responds to the mood of the house.
-What?
-She doesn't want to hear... all of this dissension.
I don't think she knows anything about what goes on.
Well, you're wrong,
Tom, you're wrong.
I spoke to her for two hours today... and I swear I could sense a response.
Yes, a response, however remote, no matter how buried.
-That's right.
-Talking, it's what she needs.
Loving, lots of it.
I think we-- well, I have to say...
I think we're deluding ourselves.
Well, you don't know everything, Tom... though you always talk as though you do.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Now listen, you two.
Grief's supposed to bring families together... not drive them apart.
Come on now, Mumsy.
Sit down here by your husband.
You make us feel ashamed, Martin.
-Hold hands.
-Huh?
Hold each other's hands!
Share your grief.
Hold on to each other.
Don't shout at each other!
Look, I have no wish to argue.
We never used to. It's only since you arrived, Martin.
-Oh, Tom.
-Do you want me to go?
Is that it?
Well, what about your job?
Or don't you have a job?
-I'm not a sponger, sir.
-Of course, you're not.
But you don't have a job.
-We shouldn't pry, Tom.
-But you haven't, have ya?
I've--I've had many jobs.
But you haven't got one now, have ya?
As soon as I saw the situation in this house, sir...
I knew I had a job.
How do you mean, Martin?
Well, I see a husband and a wife... good people, unaware of the bitterness... which is growing between them... which would eventually destroy them.
Now, look--
I see a good woman... worn down to exhaustion and despair by her labor... and her imprisonment.
Yes, yes.
I see a poor, young girl... whose only hope of any semblance of humanity...
Iies in the loving care of someone young enough... brave enough, strong enough... devoted enough, and free enough... me.
Yes, Martin, you.
But as you set your face against it, sir... so be it.
It's your house.
Please don't go straight away, Martin.
-Look--
-Not tonight.
All I'm asking is how long you might be here.
Now that's not unreasonable, is it?
How much would it cost to have a professional nurse... in full-time attendance?
Well, of course--
And how much on top of that for a cook... a cleaner, and a companion?
Yes, did you like your omelet, dear?
What?
Tomorrow, I'll do a boeuf bourguignon... followed by a nice creme brulee... or maybe a chestnut cream vacherin.
Wouldn't that be nice, eh?
And then you could go to the cinema... and catch up on
"The Sound of Music."
Oh, wouldn't it, Tom?
Just imagine.
Chestnut cream vacherin--
Or just a mousse, if you prefer.
I ask nothing in return... except the chance to be with the girl I once loved.
I don't care over much for puddings.
Well, there are other things more important than pudding--
But, I do like a nice boeuf bourguignon.
Three men and his dog went to mow a meadow
Three men, two men, one man and his dog
Went to mow a meadow
Four men went to mow, went to mow a meadow
Four men, three men, two men one man and his dog
Went to mow a meadow
Five men and his dog went to mow a meadow
Five men, four men, two men
Three men, one man and his dog
Went to mow a meadow
Six men went to mow
Went to mow a meadow
Seven men, six men, five men, four men, three men two men, one man and his dog
Not a sparrow falls.
Martin!
Martin?
What is it?
The bird...
The poor little bird.
Oh, Martin.
Oh, Mumsy.
Oh, there. There now.
No, don't cry.
Don't cry.
Yes, well...
That was very nice,
I must say... a genuine beef bourguignon.
I told you it would be.
Well, thank you.
Thank you both very much.
You see, I'm so used to people trying to outmaneuver one, and--no, no, you make me feel really rather ashamed... of what l--of my rudeness last night, Martin.
Oh, Tom.
Nonsense, it's perfectly understandable.
You've every right to be suspicious.
It's not easy being a father nowadays, is it?
Oh, now there you've put your finger right on it.
I mean, you didn't know me from Adam, did you?
Quite! Quite!
I could have been the devil himself for all you knew.
I've been having a bad time recently.
I'm not feeling myself at all.
Nightmares, that sort of thing.
Oh, dear.
You know, that's more or less what I thought you were.
What? The devil?
Oh, well, not literally of course, no.
No, I simply felt--
Anyway, it doesn't matter, I'm sorry.
I knew you'd see, Tom.
I knew you would.
Well, why don't we open a bottle of something?
Put a seal on it.
Oh, lovely.
Couldn't help noticing... the bottle of Scotch in the larder, actually.
I'll get it! How lovely.
Oh, thank you, Tom.
Thank you for seeing.
Uh, will you have a drink, too, Norma?
-Mm-hmm, may l?
Yeah.
Well, we'll all have a toss.
I don't normally consume alcohol, sir.
Oh very wise, very wise.
One bottle and 3 glasses.
Yes, I'm afraid we haven't got anything to go with it.
We got rather out of the habit of entertaining.
Are you able to drink it neat, dear?
I don't see why not.
Not too much now, Mumsy, you'll get a headache.
Now, now, only a little.
There we are.
No, no, our guest first.
Oops, sorry.
There we are then, Martin.
Thank you very much, very nice.
Well, cheers.
-Oh, a toast.
-Toast?
To a happy household.
Happy household.
And long may it be so.
Long may it be so.
Poor old Patty.
She's still a very lovely girl, sir.
She would've been yours,
Martin, in the end.
I'm sure she would.
She is mine. She is.
Oh, Tom, why don't you...
-you know?
-What?
Oh, you haven't for such ages, Tom.
Not for 4 years.
Oh, no, I couldn't.
Oh, please, Tom.
Just to show that, well... things are changing, hope is coming back into our--
-Please, Tom.
-Do you really want me to?
I really want you to, Tom.
I really do.
Oh, very well, very well.
Go on, then.
Oh, goody! How lovely!
I wondered why no one ever played it.
What are you gonna play, sir?
I used to use this thing in my business.
I vowed I'd never play it again.
You know what to play, don't you, dear?
Oh, are you sure?
Oh, yes, please play it.
It will mean so much.
Bless this house,
O Lord, we pray
Make it safe by night and day
Bless these walls so firm and stout
Keeping want and trouble out
Bless the folk who dwell within
Keep them pure and free from sin
Bless us all that we may be
Fit, O Lord, to dwell with thee
Bless us all that one day we
May dwell, O Lord, with thee
Can't you sleep, dear?
I can never sleep, never.
I wish...
What? What do you wish?
Nothing.
My prayers, Tom... they will be answered.
That'll be the day.
Shut up, you bitch. Shut up!
Shut up, bitch!
What are you doing?
Patty, Patty.
Daddy!
-Patty--
-Don't speak, Norma.
Oh, Patty!
How could you?
And with that woman.
No, no, honestly, I'll be fine.
I'll see you all in the morning.
So sorry, sir.
Hello!
Fancy bumping into you!
Well, well, hello!
Fancy seeing you. This is nice.
I'm so glad I've bumped into you.
You're the last person
I expected to see.
How are you? My, my, my.
It must be all of-- what? Two, 3 years?
And where was it? Oh, not here.
Oh, no, not in this place.
Oh, I'd say not.
Well, anyway, I'm very, very glad to see you, old chap... and I'm sure the bishop will be, too.
He misses you terribly.
Why, I've seen him with tears in his eyes.
Well, in his one good eye.
Oh, come, come, old lad, none of that.
We don't want any of that, do we?
How's the old arm, by the way?
The left one, wasn't it?
Through a glass door, eh?
The tank itself...
...was unusual in that it was vertical...
...and looked like an old boiler. inside the tank the subject wore a heavy glass bubble...
...and you would have thought the whole contraption uncomfortable to say the least. it was, however, effective. of the 23 students tested, only two found the experience unpleasant.
Some even called it exhilarating.
A number of students hallucinated.
Dr. Jessup found the encephalographic evidence especially interesting.
And one Saturday afternoon, in April 1967...
...he decided to try the experience for himself.
Arthur. Hey, Arthur.
Are you there?
Can you hear me, Arthur?
Arthur, answer me.
Is that it? You want me to come in and get you out? i want to get a look at those EEG tracings.
How do you feel?
Not bad.
I hallucinated like a son of a bitch.
A variety of dream states, mystical states...
...a lot of religious allegory, mostly out of Revelation.
You were in there close to five hours.
It felt like an hour.
I'd like to try that myself sometime.
You should. You'll like it.
Did we have any communication?
Sure. I kept checking you out like you told me to.
How did I respond?
Very orderly.
At one point you were crying.
You mean, actually crying?
You were sobbing.
There were tears on your face.
When I asked you what was going on, you said you were...
...re-experiencing your father's death.
Did you make notes?
It's all there.
I'd like to try this again next week. Do you think you could make it again next week?
What are we looking for?
I don't know, yet.
There's really very little literature on this kind of research.
There are some good people in the field:
Tart, Ornstein and Deikman...
...but most of it is radical-hip stuff, drug-culture apologias.
Obviously, the first thing to do is set up some sensible methodology...
...study these experiences under controlled laboratory conditions.
It won't interfere with the work we're doing with Hobart.
What are we getting into?
Sensory deprivation? Isolation studies?
I mean, where will we be going with the tank stuff?
We're not writing up a grant.
Strictly bootlegging, just for kicks.
We've got the use of this tank.
Let's play with it.
Let's find out where it takes us.
It's fascinating stuff.
I think we ought to get into it.
I didn't even know they had one of those isolation tanks at New York Hospital.
Must be some guy in the Psychology Department...
...doing sensory deprivation studies.
What's Jessup doing with it?
You've got me. He's been taking students out of his classes and testing them.
He's been doing this for three, four months.
Did you know...
...Jessup was into this kind of stuff?
Not until you just told me.
What do you want?
How long are you going to let it ring?
It's okay, I'll get it.
He's the last guy in the world I figured...
...to be screwing around with anything as flaky as altered states of consciousness.
Let's face it.
Jessup is pretty flaky himself.
That's him.
Arthur says you're very shy.
He wants me to draw you out.
Draw me out?
That doesn't sound like Arthur.
Well, what he actually said was you were a high-handed, arrogant prick.
A little nuts, but brilliant...
...and that if I ever got you talking,
I would find you fascinating.
That sounds more like Arthur.
He says you're doing some work with him and Alan Hobart at Payne-Whitney.
What sort of work?
Toxic metabolite stuff.
We're replicating Heath's and Friedhoff's strategies...
...trying to find maverick substances specific to schizophrenia.
I think we're chasing our tails.
What do you do?
I'm a physical anthropologist.
I'm sweating out my dissertation.
Where?
Columbia.
Holloway, and that bunch.
You're kind of young for a Ph. D., aren't you?
I'm 24.
That's still pretty good.
I didn't get my Ph. D. until I was 25.
I'm supposed to be a whiz kid.
I'm a whiz kid, too.
Anthropology seems to attract good-looking women.
So you don't think schizophrenia can be reduced to a single etiological agent?
I'm not even sure it's a disease.
You think madness is simply another state of consciousness?
There's a body of evidence to support that.
You don't like to talk about your work, do you?
As a rule, no.
I'm interested in interior experiences, especially the religious experience.
The only reason I'm working with schizophrenics now...
...is the religious experience is so significant in schizophrenia.
There's only so much you can do with animals.
I worked with monkeys...
...but they can't tell you what goes on in their consciousness.
You need human beings for that.
You can't ablate human beings, nor stick electrodes in their skulls...
...so I have to use a trance-inducing technique...
...and the isolation tank seemed the least risky.
And I'd like to go home with you tonight.
Would that be all right with you?
I've got a roommate.
We'll be confined to the living-room couch.
What's wrong with the living-room couch?
You tend to slip off a lot.
I'm sure we'll manage.
I'm sure we will.
So, whenever you want to go there, you let me know.
How about right now?
What are you thinking about?
God...
...Jesus, crucifixions.
As a rule, do you usually think about
Christ and crucifixions under sexual stress?
When I was nine years old,
I used to see visions...
...visions of saints and angels, even Christ himself.
Of course I don't do that anymore...
...not since I was 16.
Were your parents religious?
Anything but.
My father was an aeronautical engineer.
My mother, a clinical psychologist.
What happened?
I mean, how did a little kid who saw visions of Christ turn into a physiologist...
...teaching at the Cornell Medical College?
I stopped believing.
It was very dramatic.
My father died a protracted and painful death of cancer.
I was 16 years old and very fond of my father.
I used to race to the hospital every day after school...
...and sit in his room doing my homework.
He was very heavily sedated.
The last few weeks he was in coma.
One day I thought
I heard him say something.
I got up and leaned over him...
...my ear an inch away from his lips.
"Did you say something, Pop?"
Then I heard the word he was desperately trying to say, a soft hiss of a word.
He was saying...
"... terrible..."
"... terrible."
So the end was terrible, even for the good people like my father.
So the purpose of all our suffering was just more suffering.
By dinner time, I had dispensed with God altogether. I never saw another vision.
I haven't told anybody about this in 10 years.
I'm telling you now because I want you to know...
...what sort of a nut you might be getting mixed up with.
Arthur was right.
You are a fascinating bastard.
Well, it's settled.
Metcalfe spoke to Spencer again this morning and it's definite. The job's mine.
I'll be in Nairobi doing my post-doc work July and August...
...and in September,
I'll be teaching at Harvard.
Terrific.
It looks like we'll both be teaching at Harvard in September.
Looks that way.
You can't get any tidier than that, can you?
We're going to be together in Boston and I think we should get married.
You know, of course,
I'm supposed to be at least a little bit nuts.
A little bit?
You're an unmitigated madman!
You don't have to tell me how weird you are. I know how weird you are!
I'm the girl in your bed the past two months.
Even sex is a mystical experience for you.
You carry on like a flagellant, which can be very nice...
...but I sometimes wonder if it's me that's being made love to.
I feel like I'm being harpooned by some raging monk in the act of receiving God.
And you are a Faust freak, Eddie.
You'd sell your soul to find the great Truth.
Well, human life doesn't have great truths.
We're born in doubt. We spend our lives persuading ourselves we're alive.
And one way we do that is we love each other, like I love you.
I can't imagine living without you.
So let's get married.
If it turns out to be a disaster, it'll be a disaster.
We'll shake hands and say goodbye.
He's giving her dimethyltryptamine.
It takes effect in about a minute and she'll trip out for about half an hour.
Do you feel different now?
Less anxious?
Much less.
Do you have any special feelings?
I feel...
...like my heart is being touched by Christ.
There's a lot of religious delusion among acute schizophrenics.
Some guys say schizophrenics are physically different from the rest of us.
It's almost as if they were trying to change their physical selves to...
...adapt to their schizophrenic image of themselves.
All right, we'll get married, since it's that important to you.
I'm not comfortable with women...
...and I'm not likely to find anyone half as remarkable as you again.
I think I can make a reasonably good husband.
I don't want to lose you, you see.
I suppose that's the closest thing to a declaration of love I'll ever get out of you.
Am I really that weird in bed?
Sometimes.
Shall I try to change?
No, I kind of like it.
- Daddy, I'm tired.
- We'll give the little lady a ride!
Hey, Mason, be careful.
How you doin', Eddie?
Hi, Mason. How about a beer?
- If I didn't see this, I wouldn't believe it!
- You were supposed to come next week!
Look at the family man!
Oh, Eddie, you look so good!
I don't believe it.
Not again? When did this happen?
Well, it's a long story.
Have you found a place yet?
We got a nice little place near Huntington Field.
We moved to San Francisco seven years ago.
Arthur is going to teach at Boston U.
I can't believe it's been seven years.
I hear you just got associate professor.
You guys must be loaded!
We've got a place in Maine you can use for the summer.
I'm going to Africa again in June.
Eddie will be in Mexico.
Do you know a guy named Eccheverria,
University of Mexico?
Says he worked with you.
Sure. A very bright young guy.
He's here at the Botanical Museum.
We'll all have to get together.
I'm going back to Mexico with him in June.
What's in Mexico?
Eccheverria's got this witch doctor down there, the Hinchi Indians.
They're an isolated tribe in Central Mexico who still practice...
...the ancient Toltec rituals, sacred mushroom ceremonies, that kind of thing.
Apparently they use some kind of hallucinatory drug...
...that is supposed to evoke a common experience in all users.
Maggie has fallen asleep on the couch.
Will you take care of her?
Did you ever get into an isolation tank since New York?
No. Did you?
No, but I just found out there's one here at the Medical School.
I didn't think anybody was doing those kind of studies anymore.
We did some interesting stuff in that tank...
...in New York for the few months we played around with it.
Maybe when I get back from Mexico we'll get into it again.
Why not?
A terrific housekeeper she's not.
They're getting a divorce, you know.
- I don't know if they're getting...
- What are you talking about?
She and the kids are moving to Cambridge.
That's why this place is such a mess.
They're moving her stuff into storage tomorrow.
Then she's going off to Africa for a year with the kids.
And he's going to Mexico.
When she comes back, she's going to live in Cambridge and he's staying here.
It's he who wants the divorce, not her.
I'm surprised they stayed together this long.
When did all this happen?
She just told me five minutes ago.
What about the letters she kept writing us about how happy they were?
Don't ask me. She's still crazy about him.
He's still crazy.
Sylvia just told me you're getting a divorce.
We're getting separated.
We probably won't get around to the divorce until next year.
I know it's none of my business, but why?
You're married to a great woman who adores you.
My God, if anybody has it made, you have.
You're a respected and admired figure...
...a full professor on the faculty of the Harvard Medical School.
For God's sake, is that how you imagine me? A respected and admired figure?
A devoted father? A loving husband?
Well, I've also published nearly two papers a year for the last seven years...
...and not a fundamental piece of work in the lot.
I sit around the living rooms of other young married faculty members...
...talking infantile masturbation, who's sucking up to the head of the department...
...whose tenure is hanging by a thread.
Emily is content to go on with this life.
She insists she's in love with me, whatever that is.
What she means is she prefers the senseless pain...
...we inflict on each other to the pain...
...we would otherwise inflict on ourselves...
...but I'm not afraid of that solitary pain.
If I don't strip myself of all this clatter and clutter and ridiculous ritual...
...I shall go out of my fucking mind!
Does that answer your question, Arthur?
What question was that?
You asked me why I was getting divorced.
Listen, it's your life.
I'm sorry I even asked.
Why don't I call Eccheverria and we'll all go out and have some dinner?
As a matter of fact, Eduardo, my year in India was disappointing.
No matter how you slice it...
...yoga's a state-specific technology operating in the service of...
...an a piori belief system...
We scientists have a moral obligation to the public as well as to our own research.
It just never occurred to baboons...
...that they could shorten that time to five minutes if they used a stick.
Originally, man was just another savanna-living primate like the baboon.
What dignifies the yogic practices is the belief system itself is not truly religious.
There is no Buddhist god, per se.
It is the Self, the individual Mind, that contains immortality and ultimate Truth.
What is not religious about that?
You've simply replaced God with the original Self.
Yes, but we've localized it.
Now I know where the Self is.
It's in our own minds.
It's a form of human energy.
Our atoms are six billion years old.
We've got six billion years of memory in our minds.
Memory is energy! It doesn't disappear!
It's still in there!
There's a physiological pathway to our earlier consciousnesses.
There has to be.
It's in the goddamned limbic system.
Jessup, you're a whacko!
What's whacko about it?
I'm a man in search of his true Self.
How archetypically American can you get?
Everybody's looking for their true selves.
We're all trying to fulfill ourselves...
...understand ourselves, get in touch with ourselves...
...face the reality of ourselves, explore ourselves, expand ourselves.
Ever since we dispensed with God...
...we've got nothing but ourselves to explain this meaningless horror of life.
You're whacko.
Well, I think that the true Self...
...that original Self, that first Self, is a real, mensurate, quantifiable thing...
...tangible and incarnate...
...and I'm going to find the fucker.
What are their chemical properties?
Are they safe?
The mushrooms are almost certainly amanita muscaria...
...a very powerful psychedelic and a little dangerous.
It contains belladonna, alkaloids...
...atropine, scopolamine.
The sinicuiche plant is highly regarded...
...among a number of Indian tribes.
I've seen it as far north as Chihuahua.
The Indians say it evokes old memories...
...event ancient ones...
...and the Hinchis call it The First Flower.
The first in the sense of primordial?
Yes.
In the sense of the most ancient.
I'd like to try it.
Do you think they would let me join in their ritual?
Well, they seem like agreeable people.
Est todo bien para ti participar en la ceremonia.
He says it's all right for you to participate in their ceremony.
Ask him what kind of an experience
I can expect.
Are they gathering these mushrooms for the ritual?
No, they're being harvested for next year.
Qué clase de experiencia puede esperar mi amigo?
Su alma regresar a su primera alma.
Your soul will return to the First Soul.
Ask him what this First Soul will look like.
?Cómo es la primera alma?
Es la ateria increada.
It is Unborn Stuff.
Entonces, usted se lanzará en el vacio...
Then you will propel into the void.
Usted verá una mancha.
You will see a spot.
La mancha se convertiráen una grieta.
The spot will become a crack.
Esta es la Grieta Entre la Nada...
This is the Crack Between the Nothing...
De esta Nada saldr su Alma increada.
...and out of this Nothing will come your Unborn Soul.
Digale que extienda la palma de la mano.
He wants you to hold the root.
Put out your hand with your palm up.
Are you all right?
We only have their word I killed a lizard.
You didn't see it and I have no recollection of it!
This whole hideous business is just a joke...
...the Indians have played on me to make the gringo look like a fool!
Look, you asked me what happened and I told you!
You drank the mixture and you went outside.
After a while there was a scream and some dogs were barking.
I shouted after you.
The screaming stopped.
The brujo yelled at me to come back.
Oh, bullshit!
Then why did you ask the brujo to give you the mixture to take back to Boston?
I thought I'd like Arthur to analyze, maybe synthesize, it.
The noise is stupefying.
The sun became black...
...as sack cloth.
The full moon became like blood.
Then a great mountain burning with fire...
...was thrown into the sea.
Then the beast ascends from the bottomless pit.
The angel of the bottomless pit.
His name is...
...Abaddon.
He's off the wall!
Are you okay?
Get this stuff! It's new!
It's deafening! The noise is deafening!
Can you hear me above this noise?
The most unbelievable thing I've seen!
I'm watching the birth agony of a mountain!
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?
I'm fine. Really, I'm fine.
Do you want me to bring you down now?
What happens now?
He's blacked out.
These blackouts can get pretty freaky.
Sometimes they last as long as four hours.
When he comes out of it, he's as chipper as a bird, but he doesn't remember a thing.
Just how dangerous is this stuff he brought back from Mexico?
I didn't say dangerous, just said it was weird.
It hangs around too long...
...and what's really screwy is it heads straight for the brain.
Well, I don't believe this.
You guys are shooting up with an untested drug that stacks up in the brain...
...and works in the nucleus of the cell and you don't call that dangerous?
For the record, we don't actually shoot up.
- Eddie drinks a 10-milligram...
- It will stop now!
You guys are supposed to be reputable scientists...
...not two kids in the dorm freaking out on Mexican mushrooms!
Why do you think I called you for?
Let's see you stop him.
This ain't LSD, goddamnit!
This is no serotonin antagonist you're drinking!
How many grams of that stuff you think you've got in you?
Two? Three?
You could be working up one hell of a case of cancer...
...with all the antimetabolites in you.
The Hinchis have been drinking that stuff for centuries with no incidence of cancer.
Fuck the Hinchi Indians!
You don't know anything about those mushrooms!
They seem to have fantastic staying powers!
We've shot up at least 30 rats with that stuff.
Some of them have a whopping load in them...
...and none of them have been noticeably affected.
Where are we going?
We were going to get something to eat.
Eddie wants to show me an isolation tank.
Isolation tank! You guys get flakier every time I talk to you!
I thought all that isolation tank stuff went out in the '60s...
...with Timothy Leary and all them other gurus!
Will you shut up for a minute and let somebody else say something?
What happens during these blackout periods is...
...you get the feeling of phenomenal acceleration...
...like you're being shot out over millions, billions of years.
Time simply obliterates.
You sense the hallucination is going on, but you get no images.
I want to break through that blackout barrier.
I want to know what those images are that I know are going on but I can't see.
We can't raise the dosage of the drug because we're close to toxic levels now.
The only way to intensify the experience is...
...to take the 200 milligrams along with the tank.
There's more I'd like to do to that drug before you take it again.
I'd like to do a half-life determination.
- That would take us a year!
- I'd like to know the transport system.
I'd like to find some analogues.
This Mexican stuff is an extraordinary substance...
...and every instinct I have tells me
I'm onto something hot here...
...and another 200 milligrams isn't going to kill anybody.
There it is.
Oh, it's horizontal.
It's smaller than the one we had in New York.
If they're doing sleep studies, it must be...
I don't think anybody's used it in years, but I checked it out yesterday and it works.
It won't take a week to get this place cleaned.
You could get your ass in a sling...
...if it ever gets out you're using an untested drug on human subjects.
Don't worry.
Nothing's going to happen to me.
Let's get a quick hamburger.
I'm seeing one of my students tonight.
All right!
Do what you want to do.
I think you're both irresponsible as hell!
Don't call me and tell me you're worried about Eddie putting all this shit into him!
I'm telling you, don't you put any more of that shit into him...
...until you know a hell of a lot more about it!
I've offered you the use of my lab and all the rats you can cut!
That's as much as I want to be implicated in your dumb experiments!
Go get your own dumb hamburger.
I've already got my own date
I'm an hour late for!
I already did these first three.
You do the rest.
Couldn't resist, right?
Well, somebody's got to keep his eye on you two sorcerers.
What have you got in there, some kind of salt solution?
Ten percent magnesium sulfate, for buoyancy.
Weird, man.
One, two, three, four. one, two, three, four.
Okay, you're fine.
Wednesday, January 7th, 4:28 P. M.
Hey, this is terrific!
He went into theta like a shot.
No spindling, nothing.
Grasslands, savannas. i feel...
...i am actually alive and inside this landscape.
A density of woodlands about a mile away.
Beyond that, mountains that seem to be smoking.
Newly born mountains,
Cenozoic, latter Tertiary. i'm in an edge-area.
Utter tranquility, but alive.
Life in the trees. Life in the sedge. oh, my God...
...the birth of man. That's got to be it! y God! There it is...
...a proto-human.
The first, and the original truly human form...
...tiny, perhaps 4 feet high, completely furred...
...chimp-like, but erect.
No knuckle walking. Shorter arms.
He's moving along so gracefully.
There's two, three of them.
Bipedal, tiny, little furred humanoid creatures...
...a chunk of lava in their hands...
...stalking or hunting something.
For Christ's sake.
Are you okay, Eddie? i'm becoming one of them. i'm no longer observing. i'm one of them.
Killing something, a goat. i'm killing...
...i'm eating...
...i'm eating the blood, hot flesh of a goat.
Are you okay?
Beautiful.
Do you want to come down?
It sounded like he was having a bad trip to me.
Some of these tank trips can get pretty creepy.
What the hell was that?
Are you okay?
Beautiful.
Do you want to stop this?
- Do you want me to leave you alone?
- Yeah.
I thought you said these things don't last more than four hours.
It's a quarter to nine.
He's coming out.
I don't like being out of contact for these long periods of time.
I think he's in shock.
He must have had a seizure, hit his head or something.
What do you want blood tests for?
What does he say?
"Buccal smear, blood for a karyotype...
"... also pictures for the Goodman and Sarich lab.
"Picture of my neck. Now, before I...
"... reconstitute."
Before he what?
Before he reconstitutes.
Then take his damn blood, and maybe he'll let me have a look at him.
Do you mind if I examine your neck for a minute?
Any masses?
Stop talking shit!
Are you trying to say your dumb hallucination has externalized?
What did he write?
"Not common aphasia.
"Time-space, fallout from the hallucination."
You are a fucking flake, Jessup.
Get dressed. I'm taking you to the Brigham...
...and do a complete workup on you.
You are a very sick dude, you dumb son of a bitch.
I'll look down your throat, do some skull films...
...get a CAT scan, maybe even an arteriogram, and I'd like...
...an unbiased eye to look at those EEG tracings.
What does he say?
"X-ray! "
All right, finish up with him and let's get him over to X-ray.
Be right back. is it possible it's purely mechanical?
Well, if it isn't neurological, it's got to be mechanical.
I'd like some plain films of this guy's neck.
A PA, a lateral and oblique.
I'm backed up to my ass!
Just take the damn pictures!
This is an emergency!
Might be a TIA.
I guess we'd better not tell Eddie he had...
...blood all over his face when he came out of the tank. He'll claim it was...
...goat's blood from that goat he was eating in his hallucination.
You know, you're really getting as weird as he is!
What do you think happened?
He's not the type for hysterical conversion, so I'm thinking seizure.
He came out of that tank in a fugue state and had blood all over his face.
He must have had a seizure while in the tank...
...bit his lip while convulsing and is postictally aphasic.
I thought maybe he had a vascular insult, a stroke, a flipped embolus...
...but neurologically he's intact, so I'm thinking seizure now.
Now you just take it easy.
None of us are so terrific at reading X-rays.
What are you looking for?
Just put these in an envelope.
Who's reading tonight in Radiology?
Dr. Wissenschaft.
I want someone reliable to look at them.
I'd rather not have everyone in the Brigham on this.
It's bad enough we've got this nosy X-ray technician.
Are you all right?
I'm fine. I tried to indicate this was just a transient thing.
A transient ischemic attack, that's all it was.
- He's got his voice back.
- It wasn't an ischemic attack!
It wasn't a seizure.
You saw the X-rays, Mason.
There was something anterior to the larynx that looked like a laryngeal sac.
That's strictly simian.
I obviously regressed...
...to some quasi-simian creature.
I'll show these to someone who can read them right.
You're reading them wrong. That's all...
...because no one is going to tell me...
...you de-differentiated your goddamn genetic structure...
...for four goddamn hours and then reconstituted!
I'm a professor of endocrinology at the Harvard Medical School!
I'm an attending physician at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital!
I'm a contributing editor...
...to the American Journal of Endocrinology!
And I'm a fellow and vice-president of the
Eastern Association of Endocrinologists!
And president of the Journal Club!
And I'm not going to listen to any more of...
...your cabalistic, quantum, friggin', dumb, limbo mumbo jumbo!
I'm going to show these to a radiologist!
Do me a favor.
Conclusion, bilateral aspiration pneumonia.
- Do me a favor and take a look at these.
- What's the story in this case?
A 35-year-old white man, acute onset of aphasia, no history of trauma.
What are you looking for?
It looks to me like the architecture is somewhat abnormal.
Somewhat?
This guy is a fucking gorilla!
Are you okay, Dr. Jessup?
Yes.
Are you all right, Dr. Jessup?
I'm fine.
I just want to make a few notes.
My God, you look so marvelous!
How have you been, Eddie?
Just fine. You?
Fine.
Look, there's Daddy.
Are you going to drive us to our new house?
You bet. Depending how nice you are...
...maybe we'll take you to a Chinese restaurant.
Don't let anybody tell you baboons aren't occasionally carnivorous.
I observed instances of predation...
...which involved the unmistakable behavior of hunters.
A pair of baboons killed the Thomson's gazelle and ate it.
There was even a rudimentary communication...
...between the two baboons...
...so I've become...
...fascinated with the work being done on nonverbal communications with apes.
I've been corresponding with the Gardners at the University of Nevada. i may just go out and spend a couple of weeks there this summer.
I've got nothing else to do except write up my report.
I don't suppose you recorded any of those baboon sounds?
Of course I did. Why?
I'd like very much to hear them.
Of course.
Mrs. Tally said she'll be here tomorrow morning at 10:30...
...to help you put everything away.
She wanted to know if you wanted her to come back to work steady. i got a letter from ason about a week ago...
...just before we left Nairobi.
He says you've been working with a very complex drug...
...which you brought back from Mexico.
It hasn't been thoroughly tested yet and is dangerous as hell.
What else did Mason write you?
That over the past year you've taken about two grams of that drug yourself...
...and you had a very unusual instance of genetic regression about three months ago.
You may have leukemia or lymphoma.
He's been trying to get you to go for a complete workup...
...but you've refused to go.
He's worried stiff that you're cracking up.
He thinks you're behaving very strangely...
...and he begged me to talk to you about this when I got back.
Mason is pathologically incapable of keeping his mouth shut about anything.
- He's a stupid, starched, doctrinaire idiot!
- Mason is a first-rate doctor!
It's not leukemia!
Or any other kind of cancer!
I've let him do a liver-spleen scan on me and a CAT scan.
I have been probed, scoped and palpated!
He's had a mirror down my throat or up my ass for the last three months...
...and there is no evidence, no suggestion whatsoever of cancer!
What else did Mason write you?
Which of these has the baboon vocalizations on them?
- I'd like to hear them.
- Why?
Did he write you that during the regression...
...I had an aphasic experience for about four hours?
The only sounds I could get out were clicks and grunts.
They sound like the baboon vocalizations on your tapes.
Mason said you took blood tests and the lab report showed...
...some characteristics of simian blood group systems.
They also picked up antigens specific to man.
I'd like to see that data.
The thing to do is for me to get back to that isolation tank and try it again!
Let's see if it happens again!
None of us really believes it happened.
After three months, I'm beginning to wonder if it ever happened myself.
They won't go back to the tank.
Mason's taken over the project.
He's got Arthur up in his lab every day fractionating rats' brains!
What the hell am I supposed to do while they're fractionating rats' brains?
Everybody thinks your father's going nuts.
Mommy, when are we going to eat?
Run along now and play with Grace.
I am convinced that the regression was triggered by an act of consciousness.
When I was in the tank,
I entered another consciousness!
I became another self, a more primitive self...
...and the drug, in some way...
...triggered the externalization of that other, more primitive self.
At least look at my data!
Of course. Would tomorrow afternoon be...
Don't patronize me!
It's just possible I'm not mad, you know!
I'm asking you to make a small quantum jump with me...
...to accept one deviant concept...
...that our other states of consciousness are as real as our waking state...
...and that reality can be externalized!
You're screaming.
I get this patronizing shit...
...from Arthur and Mason for three months and I'm sick of it!
We've got millions of years stored away in that computer bank we call our minds!
We have got trillions of dormant genes in us, our whole evolutionary past.
Perhaps I've tapped into that!
I want to get back into that tank and repeat the experiment.
The most elementary laboratory behavior!
Repeat the experiment. Confirm it!
I would like other responsible scientists with me when I do it!
I would like a little consensual validation on this.
We may have demonstrated a whole new force in nature!
For God's sake, don't you agree it merits further investigation?
I have the tapes, notes and everything.
What time would you like to come and look at the stuff tomorrow?
I just want to get the girls.
I'll be right back.
- i'll get it, i'll get it.
- No, no, i will.
It's 8:30, so get washed and changed right now...
...and I want no trouble from either of you tonight.
Hello?
Oh, Mason. Thank you for calling.
I assume you've spoken to Arthur.
No, no, I just got back from dinner with the kids.
Well, I just don't know what to say.
I think you're absolutely right.
He's on the verge of a breakdown.
He was here all afternoon and carried on like a madman and then just disappeared.
Ordinarily I wouldn't be this panicky, but I just am very worried.
- What's the trouble?
- There's an animal loose in the basement!
What kind of animal?
Monkey, I think!
Charlie! Charlie Thomas!
Where are you?
We've got an animal loose in the B-building basement.
I'm heading to the north corridor leading to the boiler room...
...so you guys come down the other way.
Now, watch your step.
He's a pretty good-sized ape.
Call the animal rooms and...
What the hell is he doing down here?
He must be in here somewhere.
I'm gonna take a look up here.
Get out of here!
What were you doing in the tank room?
I remember large fragments of what happened, but not all of it.
You'll have to be patient with me.
I've had Mason looking all over Boston for you all night.
It's okay. I'm all right.
I suppose getting a call at 2:30 in the morning from the police...
...to the effect your husband has been found sleeping naked...
...in the city zoo might have caused you some concern.
I think you could say that.
And Mason writing you this whole time that I'm having a nervous breakdown...
...and you figured
I finally flipped out altogether.
I'm sorry, Emily. Forgive me. I know what a harrowing day I've caused you.
I suppose you've been sitting here all this time...
...trying to figure out how to get me to a psychiatrist.
As a matter of fact, I have.
I don't know how you've put up with me all these years.
I loved you.
Oh, my God, Emily, I don't know how to tell you this. I really don't.
The implications are staggering.
Apparently I entered a very primitive consciousness.
All I can remember is what was comprehensible to that consciousness.
I don't remember, at least not clearly, how I got out of the tank room.
The first thing I remember are the dogs.
I followed a pack of wild dogs to the zoo.
That's how I got there.
In the zoo, I hunted down, killed and ate a small sheep.
I was utterly primal.
I consisted of nothing more...
...than the will to survive, to live through the night...
...to eat...
...to drink...
...to sleep.
It was the most supremely satisfying time of my life.
I may have killed a man tonight.
I remember...
...beating on a...
You don't know the trouble I had getting these clothes.
I had to go down to the security office.
They want you to call the security office right now.
There was some kind of ape loose in your isolation tank room tonight.
Do you know anything about that?
This ape almost killed a security guard.
You didn't bring some ape down to that tank room tonight, did you?
Your watch and stuff are in your jacket pocket. Are you all right?
Is he all right?
Tell Mason what you've been telling me.
I want to hear Mason's views on all this.
I think Mason's views will be predictable. y God! There it is...
...a proto-human. The first and the original truly human form.
Tiny. Perhaps four feet high.
Completely furred.
Chimp-like, but erect.
No knuckle walking. Shorter arms.
He's moving along so gracefully.
There's two, three of them.
Bipedal, tiny... i'm killing... i'm killing something, a goat. i'm killing...
...i'm eating hot flesh. i'm eating the blood of a goat.
Are you okay?
Beautiful.
Beautiful. it sounded like he was having a bad trip to me.
Some of these tank trips can get pretty creepy.
What the hell was that?
Did I wake you? It's Emily.
Eddie, I'm in a kind of wild panic.
I need to talk to you.
I don't know how even to put this into words...
...but I'm beginning to think what happened to you was...
...not just a hallucinatory experience.
I've got this gut feeling that something phenomenological did actually happen...
...that there was some kind of genetic transformation.
I don't know why I think this is in defiance of all rationality, but I do...
...and now that I do, I'm terrified.
I mean really terrified. Petrified.
So am I.
I don't want you doing this experiment again next week.
I have to find out if it actually happened.
I'm asking you to put the experiment off...
...till we understand it more to minimize the risk.
You can't. You have to work back from the event itself.
But you may be causing yourself irreversible genetic damage!
We're not dealing with genetics!
We're beyond mass and matter here, beyond even energy.
What we're back to is the first thought.
I'm trying to tell you I love you.
I know that.
And I'm trying to tell you, this is an all-bets-are-off sort of thing.
We may be opening a black box that may scrap our whole picture of space-time.
We might even have a link to another universe.
For God's sake, you're a scientist.
You must know how I feel.
Yes, I know how you feel.
It's very late.
Would you like to stay here tonight?
I could do with a little love and a little reassurance right now.
You'll stay, won't you?
If I come out of that tank anthropoid,
I'll be in a very primitive state...
...and impossible to relate to, so sedate me while I'm still in the tank...
...otherwise you'll have to chase me around and subdue me.
You come out of that tank looking like an ape...
...I'm going over to Mass. Mental and commit myself.
If it happens, we'll bring him down with a big bolus of Amytal.
What do you mean if it happens?
Everybody keeps saying if it happens!
Do you think something is gonna happen?
Because if you do, I'd like to know.
I'm sorry. I'm just nervous as hell.
Listen, so am I.
Anything happen?
I just checked him 10 minutes ago.
Did you order chicken or turkey?
I hope chicken is all right.
I've got nearly 11:00.
That's more than two hours now.
I think we should stop this.
Frankly, I'm really frightened!
We could be screwing up his whole genetic structure!
Now how do we stop this?
- Can you bring him down?
- He's gonna be sore as hell.
We should never have let him do it!
I don't know how we let him talk us into this.
We were humoring him, but we know he's not crazy...
...and we all know, deep in our hearts...
...he may be onto something beyond our own comprehension!
Now, because I believe him,
I want this thing stopped!
His signs are all good.
He'll sleep a day or two, come out a bit stuporous.
He's got a whopping load of drugs in him.
It's not uncommon for a psychedelic experience like this...
...to whack you out.
You'd hardly call this just a psychedelic experience.
His heart is good. His pressure is good.
I'm more worried about you than I am about him.
I'm all right.
Of all the goddamn men in this whole world, why do I have to love this one?
I can't get him out of me.
Do you know how many men
I tried to fall in love with this past year?
No matter who I'm in bed with, I have to imagine it's him or nothing happens.
No matter who I'm eating with or walking with...
...there's always this pain because it isn't him.
I'm possessed by him.
Oh, it's crazy!
I think that's the way it's supposed to be.
But he doesn't give a damn about me!
You're the only thing he cares about outside of his work.
I was never real to him. Nothing in the human condition was ever real to him.
He's a truth lover.
Reality to Eddie is only that which is changeless, immutably constant.
What happened to Eddie tonight, that was Eddie's idea of love.
That's consummation.
He finally got it off with God.
He finally embraced the Absolute, was finally ravished by Truth...
...and it goddamned near destroyed him!
He never loved me.
You knew him as well as I did.
We were all bits of transitory matter to him.
All right, now, you're going into shock.
I'm going to get you something.
We reached a point tonight where physical science just breaks down.
We're in blue skies!
Tonight was history, and what are we going to do about it?
I'm going to do nothing about it!
Tonight scared the hell out of me!
That tank just blew up!
Whatever happened inside that tank released a hell of a lot of energy.
For God's sake, let's drop this goddamn thing. I don't want to talk about it.
I can't help it!
You may want to go to sleep...
...but the way I feel
I don't expect to go to sleep for a year!
I'm on fucking fire!
I am in there mopping up the goddamned tank room and I would like to know why!
Do you believe in supernatural agencies?
No, sir, I do not!
Then what we saw tonight was a physical phenomenon...
...an inexplicable physical phenomenon!
If it's phenomenological, then it's explicable. I have to know why.
Let me talk!
I've been mopping that tank room...
...for the last three hours and I've had it! Leave me alone!
I would like to tell you what I would like to do!
We have got to repeat this with other human subjects!
We need a selective sample!
We will put up a notice in the Student Union for volunteers!
And get five or six subjects and go back to square one with them...
...and step up the doses of the drug...
...in a graduated fashion and check them against Eddie's values!
We could even get a grant, for Christ's sake!
And here you are, willing to use an untested drug on innocent human beings!
Please stop shouting!
How are you?
Would you like to go back to sleep?
Yes.
Would you mind if Mason had a quick look at you first?
Good idea.
Maybe you ought to have a quick look at him.
Oh, I hope it isn't the kids.
Hello?
Everything's fine, Arthur. He's fine.
It's Arthur. Are you fine?
I'll call you back when I'm more awake.
Everything is fine.
God, I wonder what time it is.
I should call the kids.
I can't tell you how much you mean to me...
...how much I need you and the kids.
I just wanted you to know that.
You saved me. You redeemed me from the pit. I was in it, Emily.
I was in that ultimate moment of terror...
...that is the beginning of life.
It is nothing.
Simple, hideous nothing.
The final truth of all things is that there is no final Truth.
Truth is what's transitory.
It's human life that is real.
I don't want to frighten you...
...but what I'm trying to tell you is that moment of terror...
...is a real and living horror, living and growing within me now...
...and the only thing that keeps it from devouring me is you.
Why don't you just come back to us?
It's too late.
I don't think I can get out of it anymore.
I can't live with it. The pain is too great.
Defy it, Eddie!
You made it real. You can make it unreal!
If you love me, Eddie...
...if you love me!
Eddie! Defy it!
I love you, Emily.
In October, my brother and I left Ohio.
We were driving to California.
We got into Dallas on a Thursday night.
Friday morning, while I'm eating eggs and drinking coffee, I get a good job.
I mean, it's, you know... all these people are supposedly out of work.
I'm not in town a half a day, and I've got a job.
Everything clicked.
It's as if I was meant to be here.
I'd run away from home a couple of times. Once or twice. I don't know.
And this all started,
David is running away from home.
And he takes... I took a pistol of my dad's and a shotgun.
Took a neighbor's car.
I had broken into their house and got the keys to it.
I forget exactly what it was.
Ended up coming to Dallas.
I went to work and no one showed up.
Being a weekend, sometimes they worked, sometimes they didn't.
On the way home, I ran out of gas.
And as I was walking down the street with the gas can... a person, at that time, pulled over.
I guess since I had the gas can... he figured I was out of gas.
I wasn't 100 yards from the car.
And being Thanksgiving weekend, there was no gas stations open.
He stopped and asked me if I needed any help.
I'm driving down some street somewhere in Dallas.
I had just turned 16.
And there was a guy over there,
I think he'd run out of gas...
I took him to get some gas.
This was Randall Adams.
Ended up following him where him and his brother were staying.
Eventually, that evening... we went out and got some beer.
We smoked a little marijuana and what have you.
Went to a movie that night.
I get up, I go to work on Saturday.
Why did I meet this kid? I don't know.
Why did I run out of gas at that time?
I don't know. But it happened.
The day they picked me up, December 21.
They took me upstairs.
What floor, I don't know.
But they put me in a little room.
Gus Rose walked in.
He had a confession there he wanted me to sign.
He said that I would sign.
He didn't give a damn what I said.
I would sign this piece of paper.
I told him I couldn't.
"I don't know what the hell you people expect of me.
"But there's no way I can sign that."
He left. He came back in 10 minutes.
And threw a pistol on the table.
Asked me to look at it.
Which I did. I looked.
He asked me to pick it up.
I told him no, I wouldn't do that.
He threatened me.
Again, I told him no.
He pulled his service revolver on me.
We looked at each other for...
To me, it seemed hours.
I do not like looking down the barrel of a pistol.
I do not like being threatened.
When he finally saw that he would either have to kill me... or forget the signature...
I guess he forgot the signature, because he put his pistol up.
He took the pistol on the table, put it up and stormed out.
I had a casual, friendly conversation with him to start with... to try to size him up... to see what he liked and what he didn't like.
I found almost immediately that he didn't have much conscience.
Anything he had done, it never really bothered him.
He had done other things that he told me about... that didn't seem to bother him in the least.
He showed no expression whatsoever.
It's just like he's sitting here talking about the color of this wall... or the shooting of the police officer.
He showed no reaction to any of the questions.
He almost overacted his innocence.
He protested he hadn't done anything.
Couldn't imagine why we were bringing him in.
He didn't fight or he didn't resist.
He just protested his innocence.
I told them what happened that
Saturday, that I had met this kid.
I kept telling them the same thing.
They didn't want to believe me.
Never once was I allowed a phone call.
Never once was an attorney there.
I don't know how long this had been.
I had smoked two packs of cigarettes and had been out for a long time.
Wood didn't take his ticket book out of the car.
He left it in the car on the front seat... which indicates that he was not going to write a ticket.
What he was probably going to do was have them turn on the headlights.
He didn't know that the car was stolen.
I think that there's a very good chance... that he was going to check the driver's license... and tell him to turn on his headlights, and let the guy be on his way.
Officer Wood's wife had purchased him... a bulletproof vest and had it under the Christmas tree.
Or had it stored away, to give to him at Christmastime.
His partner was one of the first female police officers... that was assigned to patrol.
They were from the Northwest Station.
Just patrol officers following the clock.
Working the graveyard shift and everything.
They had been into a fast-food restaurant. And she had a malt.
This car came by, these two dudes in it, with no lights on.
It wasn't a serious problem...
but he just pulled up, turned his lights on to stop him.
Just to warn the man that his lights were off.
Got out of the car and walked up.
Before he got to the window, where the driver was... he was in the right position.
This man just turned around and just... with a little small-caliber pistol.
The first shot hit him in the arm.
He had his flashlight. It hit the flashlight and went into his arm.
The next one hit him right in the chest.
The officer falls in the street and he was in the first traffic lane.
He lay there and bled to death.
So she's out of the car.
She empties her pistol at the fleeing suspect...
and she runs to his aid.
Procedure says you grab the radio and call for an ambulance.
Common sense would tell you that.
But what do you do?
And that time, she's so... just tore down.
And the blood.
An enormous amount of blood.
How do we hold her responsible for not following procedure?
But the main thing was, she couldn't remember the license number.
When we started putting facts together on how much information we had... from the leads we had, we found out we didn't have anything.
The only thing that we knew we were looking for was a blue Vega.
Probably every Vega that was registered in the state of Texas...
was stopped and checked.
We had people calling the office... saying, "I've got a Vega and it's not blue.
"But would you come out and be sure to check it.
"Be sure it's not mine, because
I don't want to get stopped anymore.
"I'm afraid."
If you're the investigator assigned to the murder... you get frustrated with other witnesses.
But when you got a police officer that witnessed it... you expect that they would know a little more than she knew.
Procedure.
When there's a two-person unit, when either one approaches the car...
the other positions himself to the right rear...
where they can watch all the activity in the car.
And if the man on the left of the driver gets in trouble...
their partner is in a position to help.
Speculation was, at the time... that his partner was sitting in the car.
That's where the discrepancies were.
Just a matter of time, and whether or not she was out of the car...
completely out of the car, or partially in the car...
or just sitting in there with the door closed.
And the thing I think we did then that really helped...
It didn't really help anything at all.
Let me back up.
But it was interesting, and it cost a lot of money... but it was worthwhile.
You got to cover every trail.
A guy out of California...
I don't recall his name, he was an expert in hypnosis.
He came down, hypnotized her and questioned her.
What was interesting was... she couldn't remember anything particularly about the car.
She remembered getting a malt.
They'd stopped in the fast-food.
It was a Whataburger.
They remembered all that, and stopping the car.
Got back on the road.
She didn't remember anything.
But she remembered a license number off a hit-and-run vehicle... that they had worked earlier in the night.
It was getting awfully close to Christmas.
We'd never gone that long in Dallas without clearing a murder of an officer.
We'd had several killed, but we'd cleared them pretty quick.
And this case had gone a month, or nearly a month... and we still hadn't cleared it.
We finally got the break that cleared it.
It came out of Vidor, Texas.
Mr. Calvin Cunningham, who lives in Vidor, had his home broken into... and his little Mercury Comet stolen.
We felt as though
David had committed that crime.
For several days, though, he was missing. We couldn't find him.
It was one afternoon, one of our officers spotted Cunningham's car... on North Main Street, here in Vidor.
David abandoned the vehicle and ran on foot.
We started getting little bits of information, though... that David had been involved in a shooting in Dallas of a police officer.
We would always get third-hand rumor, fourth-hand rumor.
So we went back to a few of his other comrades in crime, we could call them.
They said,
"We thought he was just bragging.
"We didn't really take him seriously."
Sitting down, watching the evening news, well, the night news.
My father was asleep on the couch.
Heard somebody knocking at the door.
It was David Harris.
I let him in. He came in.
He was standing there beside my chair... and a news broadcast advertised about a police officer shot in Dallas.
Right then and there he starts swearing up and down.
He says, "I swear to God,
I shot that fucking pig."
He says, "I'm the one that killed him."
Somewhere around Dallas, they got pulled over.
I think he said because they were checking out a stolen car.
He said that the cop had pulled him over... and walked up to the window.
When the cop came, he rolled down the window... and just pulled the gun up and shot him.
He swore up and down.
He made a big scene about it.
Jumped up and down... trying to get anybody and everybody... to listen to him.
"Yeah, I shot that son of a gun."
And everybody said,
"Sure you did, David. Sure."
"I swear to God I killed that cop."
I asked him if he'd been to Dallas.
He denied having been to Dallas.
I asked him if he'd been involved in any shooting... or knew anything about a shooting, and he denied that to the end.
Which is fairly consistent with David.
Even if he had some involvement... his first way that he always treats you, he would deny.
Then, if he felt as though you really knew he had done it... then he would be truthful with you.
He give me a pistol, a .22 caliber pistol.
He showed it to me. He says,
"That's the one I shot him with."
He gave me the pistol.
I didn't really consider it that much.
I don't guess I really realized he did shoot the cop.
He led me to a swampy area... several hundred yards behind his residence in Rose City.
There was a sock under water.
He said, "There it is."
And he had sprayed this sock with boot oil.
When we retrieved the gun...
I said, "I better do something with it.
It's going to rust up."
Even the time that I saw the gun at the trial in Dallas... it looked just as good as when I'd taken it out of the swamp.
So he had taken pretty good care of it, even though he did put it under water.
He got to thinking...
"I didn't do that and I've been saying that I did...
"and I'm in over my head now,
I better tell them what happened.
"Because they are going to send me to the penitentiary for life...
"if I don't tell them what really happened."
So he said,
"I am just bragging about this.
"I didn't do it, but I was there, and I know who did do it."
And, of course, he came clean then.
He tried to hide no facts.
He just seemed like a friendly kid.
I may have talked to him
15 or 20 minutes on a friendly basis... just to keep him friendly.
We didn't want to make him mad.
But we didn't want him to tell us something that he thought.
We wanted him to tell us what we knew.
It wasn't very long until I realized that what he knew... was the facts of the case, and it matched with what we knew.
And it had to be right.
The story that I told was...
It was like 12:00 something.
So it was the next day... early in the morning. We were stopped.
When we were stopped, the officer came up to the car... and asked to see the driver's license, and he just started shooting.
I don't know why, but it's always seemed like time just stopped.
It didn't seem like any time passed.
It just seemed like it was, boom!
Time stopped or something.
I don't know what it is.
It's like a flash.
We went back to his room.
He was supposed to ask his brother if I could stay there that night.
But he said that his brother don't like to do that.
Anyhow, he went in and never came back out. So I left.
Ended up pulling into a parking lot.
I slept there I think, for a while.
Then, finally, the next morning, early or something...
I found my way to Freeway 45.
And went back home.
After riding around with him,
I come to find out he's got an arsenal.
He's got pistols. He's got rifles.
He's got this pistol.
He's waving it around. He's doing this.
I told him, "Hey, why don't you put those in the trunk of the car?"
We stopped at a restaurant... and ordered and ate sandwiches in the car.
I bought a six-pack of beer.
He pulled this pistol back out.
And I ask him why he got the pistol out.
And he kind of laughed... rolled the window down, and fired the pistol outside the car.
And I asked him to please put it up.
And I think he handed me the pistol, and I put it under the driver's seat.
He wanted to go to the movies, so we went to the movies.
We got there probably at about 7:00.
He was the one that had picked the movie out.
I call them drive-in movies, beer-drinking movies.
$0.50, put them together and make a bunch of money...
with a bunch of people getting drunk at the drive-in.
- Are you going to concede?
- Please, sit down...
What is this, Mr. Brooks?
- Anybody can see it's an ashtray.
- Wrong!
Anybody can plainly see it's a wall-breaker!
I'm trying to speak for you!
I'm trying to speak for all of you!
I am the student body!
The show that was on was half over.
We watched half of the one show...
we started watching the first part of the second show.
We want a victory, and we're gonna get it.
I didn't really care for the second feature...
which is an R-rated, cheerleader-type thing.
I don't know what it was.
May I have some wine?
It's good, Ross.
I didn't know you could cook.
It is good, isn't it?
You got to try my celery rémoulade.
No.
I told him I wanted to leave.
"I don't really care to sit here and watch this. Let's go."
He's acting strange, he wanted to watch the end. Anyway, we left.
We drove back towards Dallas and we drove to the motel.
There's a little store.
I bought a pack of cigarettes...
and a newspaper.
And when I left, this kid was still sitting there.
I leaned against the car and we talked to him for a few minutes... and I told him that since he was looking for a job... and there hadn't been anybody at work... that if he wanted to stop back
Monday morning... that sure, he could ride out and follow me to work... and he could talk to the boss.
And he would probably get a job.
I told him that I would catch him
Monday morning if he showed up.
I told him what time I went to work.
Why, I left.
I walked around the store and went to the house.
When I walked in, the television was on and my brother was sleeping.
He had been home this whole time that I had been gone.
So I made me a sandwich...
and sat there and watched the end of
The Carol Burnett Show.
When it went off, the news came on and I watched 15 minutes of it.
And that was it.
I turned the TV off and went to sleep.
Finally, they bring in a stenographer.
She sits down and I run the story.
I tell them what happened this Saturday.
She leaves. She types.
She comes back in about 25 to 30 minutes...
with a copy of this statement.
I read through it...
and when it was basically what I liked...
yes, I signed it.
He admits driving the car and taking a right on Inwood Road... off of Interstate 35... or Highway 183.
He admits driving it.
After he made his right turn on Inwood Road...
this is where our statement ends.
He says he does not remember anything after that.
He didn't remember anything about a shooting.
He didn't remember anything about a police officer stopping him.
That part of his mind just conveniently went blank.
He remembered driving the car... and he remembered approaching the scene of the shooting... and then, from that point, he blacks out... and can't remember until he gets to the motel room... which is some 10 minutes later.
Everything else he remembers vividly.
And that's just a convenient memory lapse, is all that is.
The Morning News in Dallas County... stated that I had signed a confession... that I had confessed to the killing of Robert Wood... and they had their killer and they were ready to go with it.
The statement that I signed for Dallas County... was never... and never would have been anything as "a confession."
But yet, they labeled it as such.
Of course, I couldn't dispute this because I didn't even know about it.
I heard no news.
I knew nothing for two weeks.
They kept me completely away from everybody.
Several times we talked to her, trying to get her to recall.
"Do you recall the license number?
Do you recall anything to help us?"
And she gave us a pretty good description of the car.
As it turned out, her description of the car was real close.
It comes out that we weren't looking for a blue Vega.
We were looking for a Comet.
No telling the man-hours we literally wasted... looking for a blue Vega.
There is a difference between a Vega and a Mercury Comet.
So in reality, in regard to cars... every piece of information that was called in... they were calling in regard to a Comet,
I mean, a Vega.
The people that called in were truthful, trying to help.
They really were trying to help.
We just all had the wrong information.
There wasn't a mark on this car
David Harris had stolen.
Wasn't a mark.
Do you think a car sitting still... starting from a stop, heading up a hill... with a woman standing right behind it...
that is a very good shot with a pistol...
She should have hit the damn thing one time. She didn't.
I wish to God she had blown whoever was driving the car's head off... because I wouldn't have been here.
I went back several times... and with Mr. Cunningham, he and I both searched... and could find no indications that that car had been hit by gunfire.
Later on, he finally found one place... that he felt as though that a bullet had been creased on it.
But before he could tell me about it, his daughter totaled the car out.
Totally demolished it.
I was doing burglaries and some robberies... and a few possession cases and stuff like that.
I think he just came up to me and said:
"Are you Edith James?
I'd like to talk about my case."
That's the way I remember it, anyhow.
And I said, "Sure."
And I said, "What sort of a case is it?"
He said, "It's a capital murder." And I said...
Inside, I kind of thought:
"I've never done one, but I can surely talk to him about it."
I hate to be considered... some kind of dummy that believes in the innocence of her clients.
A lot of people think,
"A woman lawyer...
"she's bound to stupidly believe anything she's told."
I admit, I'm sort of a gullible person.
But on the other hand,
I've seen an awful lot of people... who admitted guilt or were found guilty... and all but Randall turned out to be guilty, in my opinion.
Douglas Mulder had a perfect win record.
I believe he resigned from the
D.A. 's office without any defeats.
That's why he's legendary.
Everything, as I recall, that Mulder ever said... was about what a great guy Mulder was...
and how marvelous it was that he was getting all these convictions.
I wanted somebody else in on it, so I got Dennis interested in it... because Dennis has a lot more trial experience... and Dennis wins practically all of his jury cases.
And Dennis was very enthusiastic about the Randall Adams case... because he kept saying,
"This is one we can win.
"They don't have substantial evidence.
All they've got is David Harris."
I prepared a motion for a continuance to get more time to try the case... and in doing that had to lay out my schedule for several weeks... as to exactly what time
I'd be in Vidor, Texas.
Vidor is the headquarters of the
Ku Klux Klan for the state of Texas.
It's a city where black people will not spend the night.
Black people won't even stop there to get their car filled with gasoline.
And furthermore, the people of Vidor were under the impression...
that the policeman that was murdered was a black man.
I had to stop at a motel on the way.
My wife and I stayed in one room, the lady lawyer in another room.
We arranged to get up very early, go to Vidor and start our investigation.
At about 6:00 in the morning...
Edith James, the lady lawyer, got up... and was looking for me.
While she went out in the parking lot to find me, she went to one room... and someone in the parking lot said:
"If you're looking for the lawyer from Dallas...
"he's in room..."
And he gave her the room number.
I immediately began to suspect... from the time I was that close to Vidor,
I was being followed and observed.
Doug Mulder had been there the week before I had...
and had told the people in Vidor that I was... an Eastern-educated civil liberties attorney... and that I was down there to discredit David Harris.
And then I had been recommended to see one particular policeman... who had been led to the solution of this case.
And I had the impression... that he was the one honest policeman
I could trust in Vidor.
He told me that after the policeman was killed...
David Harris went back to Vidor.
But before he was arrested, he committed a robbery down there... and had someone on the floor of a 7-Eleven type of store... with a shotgun at her throat.
Got back there... robbed O'Bannion's 7-Eleven with a.22 rifle.
Committed some other burglaries and what have you.
All this time I was on probation.
Juvenile probation.
Eventually I turned myself in for this stuff in Vidor.
I think I made a confession.
I can't even remember exactly.
So I'm told I did.
He had told us he had robbed stores, and we laughed.
"Sure, we know you have."
I'd given him one of my hats.
It's an old Bonnie-and-Clyde-looking hat, it's turned sideways.
We said, "We'll draw you a little mustache, walk in with that gun.
"Nobody'll know who you are."
About 2:00 that morning,
I was asleep and the phone rings.
I said, "Hello?" He said, "This is
David." "This is David Harris?"
"Yeah," he said, "I did it.
Will you come and get me?"
I said, "I'm not coming to get you.
I'm asleep."
He didn't have a conscience.
If I do something bad, it kind of gets to me.
I feel, "Shucks, I shouldn't have done that. I feel bad about it."
But it didn't bother him.
Didn't bother him at all.
We asked the D.A. In Vidor, Texas... what they were going to do with little David. They said:
"We'll send him to the Texas Youth Council."
And we sort of tried to inquire... didn't he think it was strange that there was a robbery committed... with that same pistol.
And here it was David Harris' pistol...
David Harris' automobile that picked up Randall Adams.
Didn't he think it was a little odd... that all the utensils for committing this so-called murder... were furnished by David Harris who got off scot-free... and was being a witness for the prosecution?
And all he said was, "We don't feel that way in Vidor, Texas.
"Our people just are not that...
"We're not that keen on ruining a young man's life."
I tried to introduce the crime spree theory.
The theory that David Harris was on this series of crimes... both before and after the killing of the policeman.
That he would be the person who had... the heart filled with malice most apt to commit a murder.
But the judge would not allow me to introduce any of those crimes.
They'd had a 28-year-old man.
The only alternative would be prosecuting a 16-year-old... that could not be given the death penalty under Texas law... where our 28-year-old man could.
That's always been the predominant motive, in my opinion... for having a death penalty case against Randall Adams.
Not that they had him so dead to rights.
But just that he was a convenient age.
The judge is supposed to have said...
That Don Metcalfe is supposed to have said... to Jeanette White,
Dennis White's wife...
"What do you care? He's only a drifter."
I grew up in a family... where I was taught a great respect for law enforcement.
I became acutely aware of the dangers... that police officers go through, law enforcement officials go through... that I think much of the public is not really sensitive to.
My father was an FBI man.
Probably at the worst possible time to be in the FBI.
It was from 1932 to 1935 in Chicago.
He was at the Biograph Theater the night that Dillinger was killed.
It was a hot summer evening.
Little air conditioning in Chicago...
and people were out for a walk.
My father would tell me that when Dillinger was killed...
within a matter of two minutes...
people were dipping their handkerchiefs in the blood... to get souvenirs.
And he vividly remembered one lady... who, all she had was a newspaper, held it up and said:
"I bet I'm the only lady from Kansas
City with John Dillinger's blood."
He told me, the "Woman in Red"... she had on an orange dress.
This is trivia, okay?
It looked red under the lights.
He said it was really orange.
So she got to be known as the
"Lady in Red" that fingered Dillinger.
He said, "It was really the Lady in Orange."
As her reward, she got a new fur coat... and a one-way ticket back to her native Romania.
His whole story from the start was two hours late.
I met this kid at around 10:00 in the morning.
He says we met at noon.
I say we were at the Bronco Bowl at 2:00 or 3:00.
He says it was 5:00 or 6:00.
Everything that we did coincide with, he was two hours late.
Two hours later.
Two hours into the night.
His testimony is that...
as we were getting off the freeway on Inwood Avenue... he stated that I'm driving the car... that we're pulled over.
He gets scared and he slumps down in the seat of the car.
That, as the officer walks up...
and shines his flashlight, and I roll down my window...
I pull the pistol out and blow this man away.
His testimony is... when I finally do drive to the motel...
I get out. I tell him,
"Don't worry about it.
"Forget this ever happened."
That's crazy.
The police officer was killed at 12:30... which is about two and a half hours after he last saw me.
Just before he went into the motel... he'd gone across the motel courtyard... to a little store over there and bought some cigarettes.
And I was supposed to go and find out if the man remembered him... coming in there just before 10:00 to buy the cigarettes.
I didn't get over there to Fort Worth for a long time.
We got some pictures from his family that didn't show him in jail clothes.
I took the pictures in to show them to the man behind the counter.
He was very cooperative and he wanted to help us.
But he honestly... He said:
"I don't remember anything about this guy coming in there...
"I couldn't tell one night from another.
Might have been that night or another.
"Cause they were always coming for cigarettes."
His brother... at first... was saying that at the time of the murder, that he was home... watching... I believe it was a wrestling match on TV.
And he said, "Me and my brother likes wrestling matches. He was with me.
"Randall, my brother, was with me all night long.
"He couldn't have done it."
He was trying to cover for his brother.
Later, as I recall, he changed... because he said:
"If I get down there and perjure myself...
"there's nothing that they can do because they've got the case."
This is the way I think that he thought.
"They know that my brother did it.
"If I get up there and lie, they are going to have me for perjury.
"I'll be in the penitentiary with him, and it ain't going to do any good...
"so I just ain't going to testify.
I ain't gonna say nothing."
So he backed off of his story completely... and Adams was left without any witnesses.
Her in-court testimony and her original statement... which should be the best.
You're talking 15 to 20 minutes after the killing.
Should be the best eyewitness testimony she's got.
It doesn't match. Doesn't match at all.
In court, she testified... he got out of the car, she got out of the car.
She positioned herself at the back of the automobile.
Her original statement,
15 minutes after the killing...
"a fur-lined collar on the killer."
In court,
"It might have been bushy hair."
The kid testified that I had a Levi jacket on... which is the same type collar, basically the same as this.
He testified at pretrial that he had a fur-lined parka.
She's telling you who killed the man.
One person in the car with the fur-lined collar.
Very convenient that the driver happened to have bushy hair.
All she's got to do is look at a picture they took of me.
But that is not her original statement.
It's a hell of a big difference from "fur-lined collar" to "bushy hair."
It's crazy.
She went through two weeks Internal Affairs... when she comes out, her testimony changes.
She goes in saying one thing, she comes out saying another.
Something happened. What?
"We refreshed her memory."
Friday afternoon,
I think it was Good Friday... we came back in the courtroom that afternoon...
and we were sort of elated because we thought...
"He's gonna walk."
And there's nothing really in that evidence.
There's just little David Harris, and nobody believes him.
And so we were very optimistic about his chances... until we walked into the courtroom... and here were all these people standing in front of the bench.
Three of them, anyway.
They were taking the oath to be sworn as witnesses.
Mrs. Miller got on the stand that last afternoon.
And she said,
"That's the man, I saw that man!
"I saw Randall Adams' face just right after..."
She said, "I saw the gun sticking out of the car...
"when he shot that police officer.
And that's the man."
And she waved her finger right toward Randall Adams.
She's the one that got him convicted.
When I was a kid,
I used to want to be a detective... because I used to watch all the detective shows on TV.
When I was a kid they used to show these movies with Boston Blackie...
and he always had a woman with him.
I wanted to be a wife of a detective or be a detective... so I always watched detective stories.
I'm always looking because
I never know what might come up.
Or how I could help.
I like to help in situations like that.
I really do.
It's always happening to me, everywhere I go... lots of times there's killings or anything.
Even around my house. Wherever.
I'm always looking or getting involved, to find out who did it, what's going on.
I listen to people.
And I'm always trying to decide who's lying, or who killed who... before the police do.
See if I can beat them.
Yeah.
I was working at a gas station.
My husband and I both.
We weren't getting along well at all.
We were arguing back and forth.
We didn't wanna go home, because we'd rather talk it out in the car... than go home with the kids and fight.
Had to listen to them, too.
So we were really arguing, and decided to get something to eat.
About that time, a police came out of a restaurant... on the right hand side of the road...
and he went to pull the man over.
She turned around.
She was looking hard. She looked.
I didn't think she seen the guy, but she did.
Because I said, "What you looking at?"
I knew something had went wrong.
She said, "You just shut up and drive."
And I kept telling my husband:
"Slow down so I can see."
He said, "Come on, we're getting out of here.
"You're too nosy.
You don't even know what's going on."
I had no idea that somebody was gonna get killed or shot.
So I just drove on.
He was one of these kind that didn't like getting involved.
He wanted to go on. He told me to shut up and turn around. Don't look.
I turned around and looked anyway.
So we heard something, like backfire or firecrackers.
And so we drove over the bridge, and I got to thinking.
I said: "Em, there're no firecrackers this time of the year."
I was thinking to myself:
"That couldn't be somebody shooting."
It was real dark, and it was cold.
It was hard to see in that car.
But his window was down.
The driver's window was down.
This is how I got such a good look.
I really couldn't see anything inside.
It was kind of... shadows on the window and stuff.
But when he rolled down the window, what made his face stand out so.
The car was dark blue.
He had a beard, mustache... kind of dishwater-blond hair.
But, like I said, when he was in court, he sure looked a lot different.
All I could just tell by this and this, that it was him.
I knew that there was some shots over there.
But I didn't want to be involved in it... because West Dallas is a high-crime neighborhood.
One of the biggest.
He was more scared of it than I was.
But when you have black people like that... they don't like getting involved in nothing.
That's just common.
Like here, nobody wants to see nothing or hear nothing.
And they'll stay completely in the background.
That's why they were having such a hard time there... finding anybody that would come forward.
Because it was in a totally black neighborhood.
She believe in, see somebody done something wrong she should tell it.
'Cause she told on me... a couple of times... that I was hauling drugs out of El Paso.
Called the sheriff down there, going to make me open my trunk.
So I ended up opening it, but there was nothing in it.
Good grief.
She's a ho, but she find out you done something, she turn you in.
Mrs. Miller had testified at the trial... that she had gotten off early from her gas station job... and gone down to pick up her husband to help him with the bookwork.
We found out that she was not doing any bookkeeping for that station... because she had been fired from her job two weeks earlier... for till-tapping, for stealing.
The reason that they were talking to the police at all... was that there'd been a three-day running knife fight in their apartment.
And they were all booked... for disorderly and drunk behavior in there... including assault with knives, and all kinds of stuff.
When they were at the police station, they suddenly decided to volunteer... all this information about what they had seen...
about the police officer's killing.
A woman called me at my home... and said that she knew this woman... who had testified and identified
Randall Adams from a passing vehicle.
This woman had never told the truth in her life.
She also told me that she had tried to call the D.A. During the trial... and give this evidence that this woman was not believable.
If their case hinged on this testimony, this was not believable testimony.
They were scum. They were just... actually scum.
He was a black man and she was a white woman.
He came to work the day after.
He told me about the policeman that had gotten shot the night before.
And I hadn't heard anything about it.
And I thought it was another one of these stories.
And he brings in these newspapers... and he says he didn't see a thing.
He couldn't see nothing, it was dark.
Wheels started rolling in his head about money.
That's when he got the idea.
Let me put it in his words.
For enough money, he would testify... to what they wanted him to say.
He would say anything they wanted him to say.
Or he would see anything that they wanted him to see.
Those were his words.
I was shocked that he did go ahead... and get up and tell that he saw the actual shooting... and recognized the boy. Identified him.
That's when I called Dennis White.
I told him, "That man's lying."
Nobody has that good of an eyesight.
From where the policeman was shot and from where they were at...
I doubt if you could have even seen them with binoculars.
I'm a salesman.
And you develop something like total recall.
I don't forget places, things... or streets.
Because it's a habit, something I just picked up.
I just stare intensely at people and try to figure them out.
Being nosy, I just stare.
I was leaving the Plush Pub one night... driving a 1977 Cadillac...
heading west on Hampton.
I noticed an officer had two individuals pulled over... to the curb in a blue...
some type of vehicle.
It was a blue...
It was a blue Ford.
It was a blue something.
The driver, I think, had long blond hair and a moustache.
And the other one didn't have no hairs on his face.
A person that is white going through that area at night... he's a sore thumb, he stick out for the first reason.
And if they don't look right, they're gonna stop you.
The officer, he walked up to the vehicle.
His car was behind...
I don't know if it was behind or in front... but I know he had him pulled over, and he was up to the car.
I think he was up to the car.
Let me think.
Yeah, he was up to the car.
As we was coming by he had to have been up to the car.
I didn't see no bullet.
I didn't see no gunfire.
Because I went on.
We have three people that testified and identified him... positively as being the driver at the time that Wood was walking... right beside the car.
So we know that he was the driver from the witnesses... and we also know... that it was the driver that shot Officer Wood... coming from his partner.
We couldn't have made a case...
with the voluntary statement that we got from Adams.
We had to rely on witnesses.
And this is what we did.
I always tried very hard, every judge I know of does... to not show emotion on the bench.
The reason, if you do show emotion... the jury might take it that you're favoring one side or another.
So you try to remain passive, emotionless, objective.
I do have to admit that in the Adams case... and I've never really said this...
Doug Mulder's final argument was one I'd never heard before.
About the "thin blue line" of police... that separated the public from anarchy.
I have to concede that there my eyes kind of welled up... when I heard that.
It did get to me emotionally, but I don't think I showed it.
In death penalty cases... we have a question, or we did at the time... of whether or not that person is of a dangerous mentality... and might be expected to commit other crimes.
To answer that question...
the Dallas District Attorney sends psychiatrists to the defendant's cell... to discover whether he is without remorse... and therefore is a dangerous and psychopathic personality.
Of course, in the instance of a person... who did not commit the crime, they're not going to show remorse.
There were two psychiatrists that appeared again and again.
Holbrook and Grigson, the "Killer Shrinks."
There was certain criticism directed against these two people... because, in effect, whenever they showed up, the purpose of their visit... was to kill the defendant.
It was April 15th, tax day.
I think I was filling out my taxes at the time.
Afraid I might be late.
A guard walks up to the door... tells me, "There's someone out here who wants to talk to you."
I ask him who it was.
He said he didn't know... but the court ordered me to talk to him. I said, "All right."
And here come this real tall, ostrich-looking dude.
He introduced himself as Dr. Grigson.
He pulled a pad out of his coat pocket... that had a line drawn across it.
On this pad, on the upper half... he had six images.
I will say a box, a square, a circle with a diamond in it.
I don't... It's been awhile.
He slides this piece of paper across to me and he hands me a pencil.
He says,
"I'm going to get a cup of coffee.
"Please copy what's on this piece of paper."
I'm looking at this man.
I said, "What? You want it copied just the same way you did?
"Or you want me to change them around? What do you want me to do?"
He said, "Just do whatever you think you want to do."
And he left.
So on the bottom half of this piece of paper...
I made my boxes and X's... and zeros with diamonds in it.
Exactly like his.
He asked me...
"What's the meaning of
'A rolling stone gathers no moss?"'
I'm looking at this man.
I said, "Are you kidding? Is this a joke? What are you doing?"
He said, "No, I really want to know your answer to that question."
I said, well,
"A rolling stone gathers no moss."
I said, "To me...
"it would represent that a person that doesn't stand still long enough...
"it's kind of hard for people to cling to him.
"If he keeps moving around, it's hard to get close to him."
He shook his head.
He said, "What about 'A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"'?
I said, "If you have a hold of something, why give it up...
"for a chance of getting something that might be a little better?
"It doesn't make sense. You've got something good, why let go of it?
"If you can get the other one, get it if you can...
"but don't let go of what you got to try to get something else."
He asked about my family.
He asked about my background.
And he left.
Total time we had talked, maybe 15, 20 minutes.
Dr. Grigson was up there testifying he would commit violent crimes... in the future if he was released.
Grigson is known as "Dr. Death" because he always testifies that way.
In about 99% of the trials...
that he's been a witness for the prosecution, he always testifies...
that they will commit violent crimes in the future.
You can't tell what somebody's gonna do years from now.
Not really.
Except based on your past record, which anybody can do.
Randall never had any prior record.
And as far as we know, he never had any history of violence whatever.
Grigson testified for... two and a half hours about all these degrees he's got.
He's been here, and he's been there, and he's studied here.
He called me Charlie Manson.
He called me Adolf Hitler.
He said I'm the type of personality... that can work all day and creep all night.
He testified, Grigson... that the future seriousness... of my mental state... would be such that if they released me...
I would go crazy and probably butcher half of Dallas County.
Even though he talked to me
15 minutes...
I have no prior convictions, no prior arrests...
I was nonviolent for 28 years.
On one instance... and that's saying if I did this, which I didn't...
he's stating that, that's enough...
For the rest of my life, watch me.
Don't ever turn your back on me.
And he talked to me 15 minutes.
He's crazy.
You can understand why a man might steal if he needs money... to put food on the table.
I can understand why a 17-year-old boy who doesn't have a car... would steal one to ride around in.
I can understand why the heroin addict needs heroin.
But it's very hard to understand why anybody has to kill a police officer.
It just doesn't have to be.
When I'm asleep and I close my eyes and think...
"Why would he do it?
"He had no background that would lead to murder...
"no reason to commit a murder."
And I look at the facts of the case and say...
David Harris knew the car was stolen, knew the guns were there... knew the guns were stolen... was on a crime spree... had had a criminal record prior to stealing this car and these guns.
He was the one that wanted to commit the murder... and get away from the scene.
He was the one that, after the murder was committed... went right back home and bragged about it to his friends.
I looked at all the evidence... and I found that I believed that David Harris committed murder.
The jury looked at the same evidence... and found they believed that
Randall Adams committed murder.
And it was their verdict that counted.
You have a D. A... he doesn't talk about... when they convict you or how they convict you... he's talking about how he's going to kill you.
He don't give a damn if you're innocent.
He don't give a damn if you're guilty.
He's talking about killing you.
You get numb. You get...
It's like a bad dream. You want to wake up, but you can't do it.
Fifteen times, 20 times a day,
I hear this same story... about what happens when a man is electrocuted.
His eyeballs pop out.
His fingernails pop out.
His toenails pop out.
He bleeds out of every orifice he's got.
They don't care...
They don't care.
All they want to do is talk about how they're going to kill you.
That's the only thing that they cared about and talked about.
At that point, that's all they're wanting.
I didn't have any idea what happened to him.
After I testified, I was gone.
I never really concerned myself with it.
Maybe I didn't want to know.
I don't know.
I didn't have any interest in knowing... otherwise I might have tried to find out.
Dennis filed the motion for a new trial...
then we filed an amended motion for a new trial.
About 20 days later, we were to have a hearing on it.
Both Robert Miller and his wife testified there.
But we could not bring out the fact... that they had said that they were gonna get that reward money... and that they didn't care whether they saw anything or not... but their car was too steamed up.
We were not allowed to get any of that in... because it was held that it was impeaching testimony... and therefore it came too late.
We kept running into blank walls.
A reporter from the Dallas Morning News... discovered that one week after the trial was over with... the daughter of this woman had a robbery case in this court.
She offered her testimony...
at a time when her daughter was in danger of going to jail for life...
and got her daughter out of jail.
How can you believe her... when the very next week the same judge dismisses that case?
The Millers are the kind of people that would do anything... if there was something to be gained... such as her daughter not being sent to the penitentiary for armed robbery... or for money.
When we went to court that day, the District Attorney was hard-nosed.
Wouldn't let me answer any questions.
He'd ask me questions, but then he'd cut me off real short.
And that's when he said something about my big fat nose.
If I'd kept my big fat nose out of their business... the Millers would be better off.
When I started to leave out of the courtroom... he started laughing, like:
"Didn't do you any good to get up here."
It really didn't.
Didn't help the guy at all.
To the best of my recollection... the brief conversations
I have had with Mr. Adams... and they have been brief...
I don't even recall ever asking him, or my having told me... that he did not do it.
Because, for my purposes, representing him on appeal...
it's totally irrelevant.
When the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas... voted 9-0 against us,
I was a little upset about that.
I felt we, A: Should have won...
B: Certainly shouldn't have been slapped so hard... with the unanimous decision against us.
I was with my family in an ice-cream parlor... and the judge and his family happened to come at the same time.
And he came over to me and made the comment...
"I see where the Court of Criminal
Appeals gave me an 'A'...
"in the Adams case."
Our highest state appellate court... the Court of Criminal Appeals in Austin affirmed the case, 9-0.
Then it was reversed by the
United States Supreme Court, 8-1...
When the Appellate Court reverses a case... they are never saying the trial judge was right or wrong.
They are saying they disagree with the judge.
You can't, for instance, in the Adams appeals... say the appellate courts were saying I was right or I was wrong.
After all, if in Austin... in our state appeals court,
I was 9-0 correct... and in Washington, I was 1-8 incorrect.
If you tally all those votes,
I come out 10-8.
Yet the case was reversed.
Eight justices of the Supreme Court were the first people to agree with me.
They're the only people anywhere that ever agreed about that statute...
were eight justices of the Supreme Court.
The Dallas Morning News had a very nice front-page story... either the same day... or the day after the reversal was announced by the Supreme Court... in which Henry Wade, the District Attorney...
vowed a retrial of Randall Dale Adams...
because there was no room in his book for a cop-killer...
getting off with anything less than the death penalty.
I took that to heart. I thought
I was going to get my chance.
For reasons that were never really made public...
Mr. Wade requested the governor to commute...
Mr. Adams' death penalty to life... and that eliminated the possibility of a retrial... based on the reversal.
I was absolutely shocked.
I can't help but believe... that some of the motivation behind that decision... was a fear that...
Adams may be vindicated at a retrial.
I just felt they prosecuted the wrong person. I don't know why.
I felt that some policeman, whether in Vidor or in Dallas... made a decision to prosecute and set the wheels of justice in motion... in the wrong direction and they got going so fast no one could stop them.
So I felt it was up to me to stop them and I didn't.
I felt it was up to the Supreme Court and they did what they could, but... it's all gotten messed up and derailed again.
Since his trial, I have given up my practice of criminal law.
I have not had a jury trial... since I heard the verdict of this jury in this case... and don't intend to.
I just feel like...
I'll let other people handle these problems for a while.
Because if justice can miscarry so badly...
I'd rather do something else.
Prosecutors in Dallas have said for years...
"Any prosecutor can convict a guilty man.
"It takes a great prosecutor to convict an innocent man."
To this day, I think Mr. Mulder... believes that the Adams conviction was one of his great victories... probably because of some reservations he has about Adams' guilt.
I got a call one morning, a lady here in Vidor... had been hit over the head with a rolling pin... and the attacker thought she'd been knocked unconscious... when, in reality, she wasn't.
And she recognized the attacker to be David Harris.
He voluntarily came to the police station.
I told him,
"David, this girl knows who you are.
"I don't even have to tell you
I know the truth.
"You know I know the truth this time."
He said, "I was wrong.
I smoked marijuana, I was drinking.
"I don't know what got over me but something just came over me."
But he forgot to mention one thing, that he was only wearing underwear.
I felt as though the attack was sexually oriented.
He never wanted to admit that... and, as I recall, he never really finally admitted it.
He'd just get to where he wouldn't deny it.
He posted his bond and went to Germany.
We had a crime with basically the same M.O. As his... and so it led me to want to check and see if he was in town.
I contacted the Worldwide Military Locator... to see if, through the military,
I could locate him.
I did, and found out that he was in prison at the time.
He really didn't remember what happened.
He said he woke up in the stockade...
and he'd been told that he beat up one of his ranking officers.
We had another occasion to have a crime that fit his M.O. A lot... so I started looking for him again, and this time...
I found him in prison in California.
So I realized again that unfortunately, he hadn't straightened up.
He was still having a lot of problems.
I was 16 years old.
I really didn't have no real dealings with the court systems, etc.
Didn't know how they worked, really.
Didn't know much about the law.
Just a young, dumb kid.
Police give you the time of this and the time this happened... and you just correlate from those events.
You just estimate from that event what time it was.
You don't know.
You're taking a guess.
Police tell you, "It was 12:30 when this crime happened.
"What time did you leave the movie?"
"I know it was somewhere around midnight.
"It might have been before then.
I don't know.
"I didn't have a watch on."
He went over my testimony with me pretty extensively.
How I should answer certain questions... things of this nature.
That's what you call
"coaching the witness."
Let's get this evidence in a spectrum where it's going to be most effective.
At the time,
I didn't really ponder on it... but he was deceiving the jury.
He wanted to deceive justice.
That's why I think that statue with the scales...
Justice? What is she called?
I don't know what she's called.
She's got that blindfold on.
We don't see what goes on behind the closed doors.
I had another woman in the car.
I didn't tell them about that.
My wife'd kill me.
She would've tore my head off if she knew I was out with another woman.
Would you tell?
That's what happened.
I was trying to get her home.
The driver's side was down because... the lady was a little sick.
She needed some air.
Because she was pretty drunk.
See, the Millers, one is black and one is white.
They said I was going with...
The reason I was over that night...
I was over there messing with this man's wife.
And I ain't never gone with her in my life. She was too old and ugly.
Like I said, the D.A. Will put something into their mouth.
They could have prefabricated the whole story.
They sure could have.
But what I saw is just what I saw.
That was it.
So if they got paid, they got paid for lying.
They already decided what to do with you in the hall.
That's why they call it the Hall of
Justice, the scales are not balanced.
The scales are in the hall, and they go up and down.
They might go up for you, favor one way, they might go down against you.
So if the D.A. Wants you to hang
15 or 20 years, you're hung.
I had all these charges still pending in Orange County.
I could have been certified as an adult... maybe given a life sentence.
I don't know.
I'm 16 years old.
I know I don't want that.
That District Attorney told me,
"Don't worry about them charges."
"I'm gonna ask your...
Defense Attorney is gonna ask you...
"if you had any kind of deal...
"or anything of that nature...
"in exchange for your testimony in this case...
"as relating to those charges.
"Don't answer that 'Yes.'
Answer it 'No."'
My husband, he didn't get that good a look at him.
He wasn't sure, because they put a bunch of them that looked alike.
They had about three or four in the lineup that had bushy hair... but he had his combed down, different to what it was in the killing.
I didn't pick him out right then... because I picked out this bushy-haired man.
I understand one other witness did pick out the man at the lineup.
I'm not sure, but I think he did.
Of course I picked out
Randall Adams just like that.
I don't know about the others.
Evidently they did at that time.
I just took off.
It's like, kids run away... they don't think about where they're going to stay... how they're going to eat, all these things.
They had that roof over their head all their lives.
They don't really think about those things... till you get out there and you say,
"My stomach's growling now."
Or, "It's getting cold out here.
It's raining."
There was ice on the road.
I remember there was a car coming pretty fast up the road behind me... and didn't see me or something... or was in one lane and came into the other lane and I was in that lane... and tried to stop me.
He went off the side of the road.
I remember this car went off the side of the road.
I'm just looking back.
I remember that.
I got a call at my house about 3:30 one morning.
One of the patrolmen in my department called... and said, "We just arrested this boy named David Harris...
"and he won't even tell us his name.
He said he wants to talk to you."
They told me something that really made me interested. He'd been shot.
David had initially told me that he had gone to a bar in Houston... and was flirting with a young lady and her boyfriend became upset... and chased him out with a pistol, shooting at him.
We knew that wasn't true.
I said,
"David, I know you're lying to me.
"We go through this all the time, all my dealings with you in the past.
"I don't know what you've done just yet.
"I know you were shot.
"I know you were shot doing something that you shouldn't have been...
"we know you burglarized a gun shop.
We know you were driving drunk.
"Got witnesses who can identify you, who can identify your truck."
I said, "You're caught.
So tell the truth."
And David said, "Okay, I killed him."
Their home was entered while he and his girlfriend were there alone.
The man was sent into the bathroom at gunpoint and told to stay there.
David took the girl and was starting to leave.
The man exited the apartment with a gun.
The man fell to the ground, or near the ground... holding onto a pole there in the parking lot of the apartment complex... and these last, whether it be two, three, or how many shots...
I don't know, were fired at point-blank or near point-blank range.
David thought that the one that was really at fault that night... was the guy that got killed.
He said, "That guy's crazy.
"He came after me with a gun."
I told him,
"David, you'd broken into his house...
"you abducted his girlfriend, what was he supposed to do?"
He said,
"Man shouldn't come out with a gun.
"That dude's crazy.
He should have been killed."
When we went to retrieve the pistol...
I had to go into the water to get it.
It was a bayou and it was grassy, snaky-looking area.
I was not real pleased about being there myself... but David enjoyed watching me have to go down there and look for the gun.
I'd been searching several minutes, he was up on the bridge... and probably 25 feet from me... directing me to where he thought that the gun had landed in the water.
He was handcuffed.
Traffic would come by, and he would turn around... and show them his handcuffs and holler at them, "Help me!
"The officials will throw me in this water and drown me."
Just anything he could do to make a joke and cut up out there.
He was just really having a good time.
The kid scares me.
To think that he could actually be out there, walking the streets... and Dallas County let him go.
The kid had seven crimes coming down on him.
He had armed robberies.
He had firing on a peace officer.
He had breaking and enterings, aggravated assaults.
God knows what all this kid had.
And Dallas County gives him complete immunity for his testimony.
Just lets him walk.
My mom had a good phrase.
She said the first night she pulled into Dallas, it was raining... and that it was lightning.
And they're coming into Dallas... and she said if there was ever a hell on earth, it's Dallas County.
She's right.
You deal with people who you sense bad vibrations, more or less.
You feel, this guy doesn't like me anyway because I'm a policeman.
You can just kind of sense something.
Maybe I shouldn't even be saying it... because police shouldn't take these things to the bank.
When you deal with people over and over, you sense a lot of things.
Talking to David, you don't ever feel hostile feelings coming from him.
I have never seen David any way... other than cordial, friendly to me as he could be:
"Yes, sir." "No, sir."
Never disrespectful.
I've never seen the bad side.
I've seen the results... and I've talked to him about it, and he's aware of it.
He remembers the bad side.
But I've never seen him committing a crime... or in a violent or volatile state.
When his crimes were confessed to... he seemed to feel better and do better during those times.
His parents would tell me he would to do better at home... he seemed to get along better with the people in town... his neighbors and friends.
But something happens to David...
I don't know what it is. I don't know if anybody can put their finger on it.
But there's no other indication of anything in the family...
that would lead you to believe he had exposure to these activities.
David's got at least one other brother and sister that I know of.
And he had one brother that drowned numerous years ago.
I was 3 years old...
I had a 4-year-old brother... and he drowned in 1963...
right after President Kennedy was assassinated, I believe.
Sometime right after that, during the summer.
We was living in Beaumont on Harrison Street...
and my dad was working on his truck out in the yard...
and mom was in the house doing her housework or fixing dinner.
Me and my brother, we had one of these little blow-up pools...
and we were playing in that.
My dad was supposed to be watching or keeping an eye on us or something.
My brother wandered off down the street...
and these people had a swimming pool in their backyard...
and they were elderly people.
They never used the pool.
I guess it had a bunch of leaves and stuff in it.
And he, evidently, fell in there and drowned.
I used to sit up in my room at night and talk to him and he wasn't there.
So that might have been some kind of a traumatic experience for me.
I guess my dad...
I don't know, maybe he couldn't get rid of the responsibility... or the guilt or something.
I don't know what it was.
I was there and I guess maybe
I reminded him of that... all the time, growing up.
It was hard for me to get any acceptance from him.
When my younger brother was born...
it was kind of like he was Daddy's favorite or something, I don't know.
Everybody's life is going to take some kind of path regardless of what happens.
I think maybe that a lot of the things
I did when I was younger... was an attempt to get back at him or something... for the way he treated me.
But I wasn't doing nothing but hurting myself.
No!
No!
Details of the brutal slaying of Page Forrester...
... at the Forresters' Baker Beach weekend retreat, are still sketchy.
Her husband, John C. Forrester, has been rushed to St. Paul's Clinic.
The Times-Lofton publishing empire, founded by her grandfather in 1876...
- I'm District Attorney Krasny.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Krasny.
- What are you doing outside?
- I needed air.
You got a lot of headlines in there.
It's a forced rear entry.
Window at the back. We're upstairs.
It's the maid.
Consuela Martinez.
And that's Page Forrester.
Christ!
We've got multiple stab wounds.
The wounds are jagged.
The blade must have a kind of serration.
I'll know much more tomorrow.
The cause of death is obvious.
- Where was Forrester?
- Over here.
He comes in, he gets hit. He blacks out.
He comes to and goes upstairs and finds them.
- And saw what?
- The bodies.
- Where is he now?
- St. Paul's Clinic.
- Mr. Krasny, was she raped?
- Is it a ritual killing?
We have no comment.
Do you have any leads?
We have no comment.
No sign of sperm.
No evidence of any real sexual pattern...
...apart from the specific wounds we found on the wife.
The knife used was a heavy blade...
...six inches, with a serrated upper edge.
- I'm betting a hunting knife.
The rope you could buy at any Safeway.
No prints were found, except Forrester's, his wife's and the maid's.
The blood on Forrester's clothes was that of the wife but not the maid's.
What about his head wound?
No concussion, some bleeding.
Blunt object.
Come on, Hal, you know what I'm asking you.
Possibly self-inflicted?
Got it! Everything was in her name.
The corporate stuff, personal, everything.
She owned the guy.
He was an employee, and you know what?
He gets it all.
Jack Forrester is the direct beneficiary...
...of all Page Forrester's corporate and personal assets.
Do you really think he could've done that to his own wife?
What the hell is "that"? You murder your wife to take all the money?
"That" is the oldest crime in the world.
Only you're real smart...
...so you make it look like some fucking Charlie Manson did it.
You want people to say: "Do you think he could've done that to his own wife?"
If I was gonna kill my wife, that's the way I'd do it.
Mr. Forrester, why didn't you go out to the beach house with your wife?
I had dinner at the Union Club and then I went back to the paper.
- I checked on the Sunday editorials.
- You don't write those yourself, do you?
I didn't think editors wrote their own editorial.
Sometimes they do.
Did you write the ones about me?
Yes. I insisted on writing all of those.
Is that relevant here?
- The editorials I wrote on Mr. Krasny?
- I was just going to object.
Objection sustained.
I was just curious, that's all.
Page was a woman of great generosity and compassion.
I think the thing I'll miss about my sister the most...
...is her great sense of resolve.
Page always did whatever she set out to do.
I'll miss her more than I know how to say.
Thank you.
Nice service.
Krasny.
Now?
He's gonna ride my ass into the Senate.
He can't do that. You're innocent.
The fuck he can't.
You've been coming here for weeks now...
...putting the best apples on top of the barrel. I don't buy it!
You say you were happy?
You ever argue? Any problems?
We've been over this and over this.
And we're gonna go over it again, and again and again.
Frank, there's no need to badger Mr. Forrester.
Right, Counsellor?
Mr. Forrester...
...l'm not trying to get you to admit you whacked your wife around every day...
...but I wanna know if you ever argued.
I never said we didn't argue.
- So, you argued.
- What did you argue about?
I told you, we had the usual arguments.
- We were married!
- Arnold needs to speak to you, sir.
I thought you had the only perfect marriage in the state of California.
That's fine, Mr. Fabrizi, but let's get back to the bit about the lockers.
The club gives me a passkey, you know.
So, I go through them.
The members don't even know
I've been in there.
I've seen all their stuff.
Their rubbers and everything.
- That's when I saw it.
- The knife?
- Yeah, the knife.
- When did you see it?
When?
It was right after New Year's last year.
They like me to go in there at the start of the year and clean them out.
Start the year off with clean assholes.
Excuse me.
They let you clean out private lockers?
Sure, they trust me.
I been workin' for them for 20 years.
What kind of knife did you see?
A hunting knife, about 6 inches long with a jag on the edge.
How'd you know it was Forrester's locker?
'Cause it was numbered 122 and that's his number.
Because right after I saw it,
I thought to myself:
"I didn't know Mr. Forrester was a hunter."
It kind of made me feel good, you know...
...that he was a hunter, you know?
Yeah. I know what you mean.
- I'm getting tired of this, Andrew.
- Look, admit it, she owned you.
- I'm getting tired of this.
- We're all getting tired of it.
We've been doing this too long.
I had no quarrel with the financial structure of the company.
Do you hunt, Mr. Forrester?
What?
Have you ever been hunting?
No.
- Do you own a hunting knife?
- No.
What the fuck is going on?
Have you ever been in possession of a hunting knife?
No.
I'm giving you a chance to cop a plea.
You think I killed my wife? Prove it.
You're under arrest for the murders of Page Forrester and Consuela Martinez.
Frank, read him his rights.
You have the right to remain silent.
If you give up that right...
...anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Mr. Forrester is the editor of the San Francisco Times...
...and president of Times-Lofton Publishing.
He is, however, charged with two capital offence felonies.
But, your Honour, the charges are based purely on circumstantial evidence.
Mr. Forrester has no prior criminal record.
I don't expect him to flee the jurisdiction.
Fine. The set bail of $500,000 will stand.
I made some calls back east.
I'll get you a heavy hitter.
I don't want anyone from out of town.
I don't want to contribute to the goddamn circus.
Your firm has got to handle it.
We're corporate lawyers.
We can barely handle a hearing.
- Jack, you got something for us?
- What do you think?
I'm innocent. That's all I can say.
- What do you think of Krasny?
- No further comment.
Come on!
Isn't this related to the Senate race?
No further comment.
My paper has been critical of Mr. Krasny's conduct as district attorney.
That's no secret. He's an ambitious guy.
He's got big political aspirations...
...so you can draw your own conclusions. Excuse me.
No comments at this time. Please, folks.
This will be a show trial, for God's sake.
We've only one person who's had any criminal experience.
- Who is he?
- She.
And she hasn't practised criminal law for four years.
Jack, give us a...
- Is she any good?
- Yes, she was a very good prosecutor.
She worked for Krasny.
Well.
Teddy, are you familiar with the Forrester case?
I go out of my way not to be familiar with criminal cases.
Mr. Forrester wishes to speak to you about representing him.
I'm in the middle of a case, Andrew.
I think it can wait, don't you, Andrew?
Oh, yes. Teddy...
Nothing in the world will make me go back to criminal work, Andrew.
You know the decision I made.
There is nothing in the world I'd like less than to lose Jack Forrester as a client.
Teddy, you know the affection
I've always had for you.
Nothing would please me more...
...than one day being able to speak to you as one of my partners.
Please, do an old man a personal kindness.
Speak to him.
Who lives here anyway, Joe Montana?
I told you. A guy called Jack Forrester.
He killed his wife. I saw it on TV.
He allegedly killed his wife.
That means he's gonna get away with it.
So, how do I look?
Weird.
- Good morning, madam.
- 'Morning.
Mr. Forrester is expecting you.
No, I agree Carl, but the murders happened over two months ago...
...and there's no leads because Krasny's locked into me.
Excuse me, I'll be right with you.
I'll tell you guys what I'm gonna do at the meeting.
All right, I've gotta go.
I'll be home all evening, so if you need me you can catch me here.
All right, 'bye.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- I'm glad you came.
- Nice to meet you.
Nice meeting you.
We met at a party five or six years ago.
You probably don't remember.
You said you like horses.
Very much.
Come on.
- Andrew spoke to you?
- Yes, he did.
And?
And the problem is,
I just don't do criminal work anymore.
Yes, I know, he told me.
I was hoping you'd reconsider.
I didn't kill my wife.
- I didn't ask you if you did.
- Lf you represented me, you would.
I'd ask about the case they had against you.
I'd want to win my case.
Did you win all your cases when you were a prosecutor?
Yes, I won every one.
Is that why you wanted me to represent you?
Yes, and because you're a woman and because you're good.
You know what Krasny's capable of.
Thanks, Karen.
All right, let's show her what you got.
Come on!
I love this beauty.
He was Page's pride and joy.
Isn't he beautiful?
The oldest equine species.
The most beautiful...
...perfectly tempered...
"It makes men imperious to sit on a horse."
Oliver Wendell Holmes, right?
Well, he was wrong.
Look at his legs.
Shows how vulnerable we all are.
What's with this lead on Krasny we're running Sunday?
It's a profile. Reviews his career, looks at the Senate race.
The Senate race is nine months away!
- I just thought now would be...
- Look, folks!
I don't want any slant, any bias on our coverage of my case or of Krasny.
You hear me?
I've put my nuts into this paper for 15 years. I want objective coverage.
I'll be taking a leave of absence until my trial's over.
Carl's gonna be running things.
I'm gonna miss you.
Thank you.
You know how much I'm gonna miss these goddamn machines?
- Good evening, Mrs. Barnes.
- Good evening.
- Is Mr. Barnes here?
- Yes, right over there.
- Hi.
- Sorry I'm late.
We went to the zoo.
David's been after me for weeks.
Damn! I was gonna take him to the zoo next weekend.
Oh, well, we'll just do something else.
Starving.
Did I hear something about you and the Forrester case?
You heard wrong.
Matthew, remember Tom Krasny?
May I?
I think you should take the case.
- Think of the fun we'll have.
- It wouldn't be any fun.
Maybe you're right.
Too bad about Styles.
What?
Don't you remember Henry Styles?
He's dead.
What?
I'm sorry.
You didn't know.
He hanged himself.
When?
Day before yesterday.
I don't know how you figure it.
Teddy and I send this guy to the joint four years ago.
He's halfway to his parole hearing, and he hangs himself.
You take care.
Good night.
When's Bridget gonna be back?
Bridget is coming back tomorrow.
- What's for dinner?
- What do you want? I'll cook you anything.
- Oh, God, Mum. You can't cook.
- Either can Bridget.
Yes she can. I thought you liked Bridget.
She farts too much.
So do you.
At least not atom bombs.
- Did you finish your homework?
- Yes.
Was Dad here last night?
He was? Why didn't he wake us?
He kissed you when you were asleep.
- 'Bye, Mum.
- Bye-bye, honey.
David.
David!
Can I have my kiss?
Tell him to wake me next time.
I will.
'Bye, Mum.
Have a good day.
Mrs. Styles.
You have no place here.
Just a goddamn minute!
Yes?
Christ.
You look like a real broad.
Come over here.
It's good to see you.
Come on in. Oh, yes.
Teddy, I'm a busted tyre for Christ's sake.
My lungs are shot.
I can't even piss straight.
You were the best investigator the DA's office ever had.
- That was a long time ago.
- Four years!
I know the fuck how long ago it was.
Henry Styles.
Dumb fucking asshole. He hanged himself.
- I know.
- I know you know. You're here, aren't you?
Forrester isn't Styles, right?
Let's say the bastard didn't do it.
You're never gonna get him off.
If he didn't do it, I'll get him off.
Stop the horseshit, Teddy.
Look, I don't give a flying fuck how much money he's got.
A rich guy like Forrester...
Where the hell's he going to find a jury of his peers?
He'll get a lot of people who hate him for what he's got.
If he didn't do it...
...l'll get him off.
Forget Styles, will you? Forget him!
You're going to eat yourself alive with all that guilt.
I can't forget him, and neither can you.
The fuck I can't!
- Sam, I'm responsible and so are you.
- Like hell I am!
Tom Krasny is responsible!
And fuck Styles and fuck you and your goddamned guilt!
I'll take the case on one condition:
If you lie to me, or if I think you're guilty,
I'll drop out.
That's not professional, and you know it.
It's not a problem.
I'm not going to lie to you.
Okay.
I want Sam to have access to all your personal and corporate correspondence.
Your financial records, your wife's records...
...everything. Absolute access.
- You got it.
We've got four months to the trial.
I don't want you out in public.
I don't want pictures of you in the paper.
Look as if your life's been shattered.
My life has been shattered.
I don't want any visible support from the firm, unless I ask for it.
I want to defend him alone.
Not with a team of high-priced lawyers.
The jury will like that.
I like her.
Yeah? She pisses me off.
Nice to meet you. I'm very happy.
See you tomorrow.
- Andrew?
- Be back in a moment.
- What do you think?
- What the fuck do I know?
Did your mother ever wash your mouth out with soap?
Yeah. But it didn't do any fucking good.
What if he passes the polygraph?
How will you know if he's lying?
I'll know.
Teddy, a guy like him, you never know.
I'm representing Jack Forrester.
Is he finally going to cop a plea?
Go ahead, I'm a reasonable man. I'll listen.
I don't want any problems with discovery.
I don't know what you're talking about.
If you hold anything back on me
I'm going to bust your ass wide open.
You talk to corporate clients this way?
I mean it, Tom.
"It's unprofessional conduct for a prosecutor to fail to disclose...
- "... to the defence at the..."
- I know the words.
I'm not going to let it happen again.
You prosecuted the Styles case with me, and you did a good job.
The jury found him guilty.
He had a rap sheet as long as my dick.
I'm going to nail you to the wall.
I'll see you in court, Counsellor.
Consuela's door was open.
What did you see?
Blood.
I ran to our room.
Was the door closed?
No.
Open it.
- I can't...
- What did you see?
That word on the wall...
...and the rope.
Her hands and her feet were tied.
There was blood all around her breasts and all over the bed.
She didn't have any clothes on.
All between her legs, the blood! Oh, God!
How did you meet her?
We met at Stanford.
We met at this party.
I didn't even know her name.
I'm glad I didn't. I never would've had the nerve to talk to her.
A couple of years later, we ran into each other at the country club.
I wasn't a member, but I used to...
...go in and use their pool every once in a while.
Then we got married.
I started working for the paper.
I used to...
...bring coffee around to everybody.
I hated that shit.
I worked in Advertising Circulation.
Got to know everything about the company.
Her father liked me.
Why didn't you ever have any children?
That was the biggest mistake we ever made.
Were you faithful to her?
You know how many times
Krasny asked me that?
Yes, I was faithful to her.
Except for a short period a long time ago.
It wasn't even an affair.
It was like a series of one-night stands.
The girl went back to France.
It didn't even last a month.
You'll have to tell me all about her.
I'll send you all the details, times, dates, restaurants.
Do you want the motel room numbers?
I may have forgotten those.
You're divorced, aren't you?
Yeah.
Were you faithful to him?
Really?
Really.
- Was she faithful to you?
- Yeah, as far as I know.
What does that mean?
It means, as far as I know.
I didn't kill her.
I know you didn't.
No, you don't.
You just want to get closer to have a better look.
- What are you doing, Mum?
- Homework, nothing much.
I could sure use a hug, though.
- You're such a good hugger!
- Really?
Really.
Mum?
What?
Do you ever...
Do you ever think about boys and all that stuff?
Sometimes.
Do you ever think about it with Dad?
Sometimes.
- Mum?
- What?
I liked it when Dad was here the other night.
I miss him, Mum.
- Give me the bottom line, Dan.
- The bottom line?
A straight, solid graph.
The machine loves him.
He's telling the truth.
Or he's the kind of ice cube even the machine can't melt.
Is he psychopathic?
No, but he's manipulative.
He didn't get where he is without being manipulative.
Neither did I, neither did you.
But did he do that bloodbath?
I don't know.
But if you're asking me whether
I think he's capable of doing that...
I saw nothing that would lead me to that conclusion.
Sam, come on in.
Thank you, doctor. I'll call you later.
All right. I've got 832 pages, signed, sealed and delivered...
...by Thomas Krasny, Esq.
The People versus John C. Forrester.
It really took Krasny two months to put this together?
Christ's sake, he's got him tied to that fucking knife.
No, he doesn't. He has a janitor who claims to have seen a knife in a locker.
- The next best thing, isn't it?
- Nope. It's not good enough.
It's circumstantial. Krasny doesn't have the knife that killed Forrester's wife.
The janitor isn't identifying it.
What about this friend of his wife's?
This Virginia Howell?
It's hearsay coming from one witness.
Kathy, would you get Mr. Forrester on the phone for me, please?
Thank you.
Krasny's too smart.
He's holding something back, that son of a bitch. He's got to have more.
Teddy, I gotta tell you.
I've been watching this guy for months now.
Do you wanna know what I think?
- What I really think?
- What do you think?
He killed her.
Hi.
He's got a witness who saw a hunting knife...
...in your locker at the country club.
I figured something like that.
It's complete bullshit.
May I use your phone?
He described it.
Said it was 6 inches long and...
I never had any kind of knife in my locker.
Why would he be lying?
All I can tell you is, it never happened.
Did you always want to be a lawyer?
I always wanted to be a prosecutor.
My dad was a cop.
What'd I get myself into?
You want some more of this?
No.
You're a very pretty lady.
Now she thinks, maybe he did do it.
It sounds like he's coming on to me.
You like to play games, don't you?
Racquetball. I play every day.
I used to play, years ago.
We should play. You still look in shape.
I don't play games with my clients.
Yeah, you do.
Tell me about Virginia Howell.
She's a real bitch.
She says your wife told her she was going to divorce you.
- We can blow her out of the water.
- How?
- Coffee?
- Yeah.
When you come back,
I want to know exactly how.
When I come back, I'll tell you exactly how.
Hello, Mr. Fabrizi? Teddy Barnes.
How do you know it was this locker?
'Cause right after I saw it, I put it together that it was Mr. Forrester's...
...and it stuck in my head that he had it.
Is there any possibility that it wasn't this locker?
Lady, listen. I like Mr. Forrester.
I wish I'd never seen the damned thing.
Now, you ask me if I think
Mr. Forrester killed his wife.
I say, "No way Mr. Forrester would ever do a thing like that."
But, you ask me if the knife I saw was in the locker here, I say:
"Hell, yes.
The son of a bitch was right up there!"
I'm telling you now.
I see this trial degenerating...
...and I'll hit you like a freight train roaring down the High Sierra.
We've got a man's life at stake here.
Not headlines, not careers.
Do you have anything you want to share with me?
- No, your Honour.
- Yes, your Honour.
I'm not satisfied that the prosecution is complying with its discovery obligations.
I have complied, your Honour.
Do you have any evidence
Mr. Krasny has not complied?
No, your Honour.
Then, what do you base your allegation on?
On my past association with Mr. Krasny, your Honour.
Cite the case.
I held something back?
Cite the case, Teddy.
I hope I don't have to say this to you again,
Mrs. Barnes...
...but you don't question ethics in my chamber...
...unless you have the evidence to support you.
Thank you, your Honour.
Yes, your Honour.
Why didn't you cite the case, Teddy?
You could've gotten disbarred before the trial.
- Do you realise how much I admired you?
- It never got me anywhere with you.
What about Forrester?
Do you like him any better?
Yes.
I like him a lot better.
Why don't you cite the case?
Put it all on the line.
The People versus Henry Styles.
Case Number 26022.
You got me! Come on.
You can catch me. Watch out!
You can do it!
I'm not sure I want to.
Yes, you do. Come on!
See? It's a cinch!
Hey, where are you going?
I'm getting you now!
- You ride very well.
- Thank you.
That was wonderful. I loved it.
You're not going anywhere.
You left your lights on.
I'll get a jumper.
Why don't you just take me home?
The first time I saw you...
...I wondered.
You did too, didn't you?
No.
You liar.
Dad?
David.
Sorry.
Good night.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
You got another one of these crank letters today.
- Hello.
- Hi, Teddy.
David called from school.
He was a little upset.
Come on, Matthew, nothing happened.
That's not what David says.
It's so difficult. If I like someone,
I'd like to be able to invite him home.
I'll talk to David when they come this weekend, man-to-man.
Thanks. 'Bye.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I got another one.
Are all the t's slightly raised?
I had the last one analysed.
He told me it was typed on a 1942 Corona.
It's a big help, isn't it?
How are you doing with the knife?
I'm striking out, that's how I'm doing.
How are you doing with our killer?
- I like him.
- You like him. He wants you to like him.
The more you like him, the harder you'll try to defend him.
I know that, Sam.
I'm just reminding you, sweetheart!
I can't.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.
I'm at a friend's house.
Jen, I gotta go.
Okay. I love you too. Bye-bye.
I make a great Denver omelette.
I have to go.
I know.
Look, I hope you don't think...
It's okay, Teddy.
It really is.
I want you to stick close to me in court tomorrow.
I think you should help me carry my things.
We might as well take advantage of the fact that a woman is defending you.
The jury's going to be watching every move that we make.
Body language is really...
Wear a blue suit.
Juries like blue suits.
Anything else?
Jack, this way!
Any new developments in the case?
Hear ye, hear ye.
The Superior Court for the County of San Francisco is now in session.
The Honourable Clark Carrigan presiding.
The facts in this case are simple.
The People will prove that on the night of June 12 of this year...
...the defendant, John C. Forrester...
...brutally murdered his wife and his wife's maid.
The murders were in cold blood with malice aforethought.
And he did it out of lust and greed.
His greed for money and his lust for power.
Finally, the People will prove that
John C. Forrester was, in fact, living a lie.
That behind the facade of all the dinners...
...and all the charity events he and his wife attended...
...their marriage was crumbling.
The People will prove that had Page Forrester divorced him...
...it would've meant the end of his prestigious career.
The end, in fact, of his livelihood.
We will prove that at the time of her death...
...her brutal murder...
...Page Forrester was contemplating divorce.
Thank you for your attention.
Do you wish to make your statement now?
Yes, your Honour.
John Forrester did not murder his wife.
He did not murder his wife's maid.
He is an innocent man, unjustly accused.
You may call your first witness.
My sister directly owned 20 percent of the eight million shares outstanding.
The shares were in her name.
She had absolute control.
Jack had less than 1 percent of the shares in his name.
Mr. Lofton, could you tell us the provisions of your sister's will?
Jack Forrester is the direct beneficiary of all my sister's assets.
All of it? Corporate and personal assets?
Yes.
Mr. Lofton.
Did your sister ever express any dissatisfaction...
...about Jack's administration of the company?
No, she was very pleased with Jack's helmsmanship.
Did she ever express any dissatisfaction to you...
...about her personal relationship with her husband?
No.
- Never?
- Never.
Do you think Jack Forrester killed your sister?
- God, no!
- Objection!
- I move to strike that from the record.
- Granted!
The jury will please ignore the last remark.
The People call Mrs. Virginia Howell.
Describe your relationship with Page Forrester, please.
We were like sisters.
What did she say about her relationship with her husband?
Objection. Calls for hearsay.
This testimony is being offered to show the state of mind of Page Forrester.
It's an exception to the hearsay rule.
He's shown no connection between Mrs. Forrester's state of mind...
...and my client and the charges in this case.
I'll allow it, subject to connection to Mr. Forrester.
What did Page Forrester say about her relationship with her husband?
She knew that he didn't love her...
...and she was sure that he was seeing someone else.
Did she tell you anything else?
She was going to tell her husband she wanted a divorce.
Thank you.
I will tolerate no further disruptions in this courtroom.
Mrs. Howell.
When was the last time you saw Mrs. Forrester at her home?
At her home?
I really don't remember.
Wasn't it about the same time she stopped playing tennis with you at the club?
No. We played together all the time.
She's bluffing.
Isn't it true, Mrs. Howell, that six months before her death...
...Page Forrester broke all contact with you?
No, we spoke together on the telephone and we'd see each other at the club.
Mrs. Howell...
...you find Jack Forrester an attractive man, don't you?
What do you mean?
Isn't it true that Page Forrester broke all contact with you...
...because she learned you were trying to seduce her husband?
- That's not true.
- You're under oath.
Objection! Badgering the witness, your Honour.
Motion denied.
Isn't it true that during the week of December 7, 1984...
...you called Jack Forrester, at his office, on eight separate occasions?
I don't remember that.
Let me refresh your memory.
December 7: 9:40 AM and 4:23 PM.
December 8: 10:15 AM and 3:45 PM.
Would you like me to read the list?
Jesus Christ. How did you miss this?
She came to us.
How was I supposed to know?
Did you ever write to Mr. Forrester?
No.
No?
No.
Is this note in your handwriting?
Yes.
I ask that this be marked as "Defence
Exhibit A" and admitted as evidence.
Mrs. Howell, did you send this note to Jack Forrester?
Yes, I suppose so.
Will you read it, please?
"Dear Jack:
"I've been trying to reach you all week.
"I'll be at the Canyon in Palm Springs.
"Wouldn't it be fun if you came down?
"Isn't it silly to keep avoiding me?
"Page will never know."
How is it signed, Mrs. Howell?
"Love, Ginny."
Your Honour, may I show this to the jury?
Mrs. Howell...
...did Mr. Forrester meet you in Palm Springs?
No.
Did he meet you any time, anywhere?
No.
What did he do with your note?
I really don't know.
He gave it to his wife, didn't he?
I don't know.
Why don't you ask her?
Mrs. Howell...
...did Mrs. Forrester, to your knowledge...
...begin divorce proceedings against her husband?
No.
No further questions, your Honour.
How was I supposed to find out?
Only the two of them knew.
Mum, I don't understand this.
- Honey, why don't you go ask Jenny?
- I don't want to ask Jenny!
- I have a trial tomorrow, okay?
- I've got a test tomorrow!
- Honestly, David.
- You don't care!
Forget it!
I hope he did it! I hope he's guilty!
David, honey...
Come here.
David, honey, come on. I didn't...
Teddy, come here.
The tennis pro at the club, a guy named Slade, Bobby Slade.
I talked to the bartender at the club.
Two weeks ago he disappears when some guys...
...from the DA's office come to see him.
Krasny's going to spring him on us.
What do you have on him?
He worked along the coast at all the clubs.
We got La Jolla, Laguna,
Newport Beach, Santa Cruz.
Santa Cruz?
I talked to 183 goddamned club members about that knife.
Know what I get? Nada, zilch.
I told you, you're dreaming.
What about former club members?
- People who quit after January of last year.
- That's a wild-goose chase!
Sam, he didn't do it!
Is that your head talking or another part of your anatomy?
Okay, what the hell? Fuck me!
You may call your next witness.
The People call Eileen Avery, your Honour.
Who's she?
Your Honour, may counsel approach the bench?
This witness was not mentioned in the discovery material.
The prosecution isn't complying...
She's a reluctant witness.
She was served a subpoena last night...
...on the basis of information uncovered yesterday.
- Bullshit.
- Mrs. Barnes.
- I want it on the record.
- I'll be happy to put it on.
- You think it'll hold up in appeal?
- What appeal? You don't expect to lose.
Here's the subpoena, your Honour.
I'll allow her testimony.
Put the circumstances on the record.
Thank you, your Honour.
Let's continue.
Let the record show that Miss Eileen Avery is a reluctant witness.
She was subpoenaed on the basis of information uncovered yesterday.
Who is she?
A friend.
- What do you mean?
- A friend, that's all she is.
- State your name, please
- Eileen Avery.
How old are you?
I'm 26.
What's your relationship to John C. Forrester?
He's a friend of mine.
Between July and December of 1983 what was your relationship?
He was my...
He was my lover.
You had an affair with him for six months...
...two years ago?
Answer the question, please.
Yes, I did.
You were in love with him?
Yes, I was.
And he was in love with you?
Yes.
Did Mr. Forrester ever speak to you about divorcing his wife?
Please, Miss Avery.
He said he wanted to.
Yes?
He said he could never do it.
And why could he never do it?
Because, he said, he would lose everything he had always worked for.
Your witness, Mrs. Barnes.
No questions.
Thank you, Miss Avery.
You may step down.
The People call Robert Slade.
Mr. Slade, how did you meet Mrs. Forrester?
I played tennis with her at the club.
And you became friends?
She liked me...
...and I liked her a lot, too.
It went on from there.
You had an intimate sexual relationship with Mrs. Forrester?
Yes.
For how long?
Let's see,
I got to the club in November of '83...
...until the time she died.
You knew she was married?
Sure.
- It didn't seem to bother her.
- What do you mean?
- She said he didn't care what she did.
- Objection as to form!
Sustained.
Did she talk about her relationship with her husband?
Objection. Hearsay.
I'm trying to establish the state of mind of Mrs. Forrester prior to her murder.
The testimony is irrelevant.
I think I can establish the relevancy of the testimony.
You may proceed.
Did she ever speak to you about her relationship with her husband?
- She said he didn't care what she did.
- Move to strike, your Honour.
Motion denied.
Please continue.
She said she knew he was seeing someone, too.
Whoever he was seeing...
...Page said he'd take her riding all the time.
Riding?
She joked about it.
She said those horses of his were...
...foreplay.
Did Mrs. Forrester ever talk to you about divorcing her husband?
She was thinking about it.
She said the thing that stopped her from getting a divorce...
...is that he was doing such a good job running the company.
She said he had a million-dollar image.
I remember once, she said that...
...she knew he was using her, but she said...
...she was using him, too.
She said that was his special talent.
He really knew how to use people.
Your witness.
Due to the lateness of the hour, we'll adjourn and reconvene at 9:00 AM Monday.
That's it. It's over.
You didn't think he'd find out?
Four years ago I walked away from all this.
I felt that I was drowning...
Over my head. The dirt, the slime.
You played me.
You played me so well.
No.
You set me up from the very beginning.
How did you find out about Styles?
- That's why you wanted me to defend you.
- What are you saying?
If you'd told me about Avery
I wouldn't have taken the case.
I had an affair with somebody.
That doesn't mean I killed my wife!
I couldn't tell you in the beginning...
...because you wouldn't have taken the case.
Later on, I...
What?
I couldn't, because you wouldn't have thought we were real!
- You lied to me.
- I had to lie to you.
Don't you understand? I had to lie to you!
Teddy, that stuff about Page.
I didn't know anything about it.
I didn't want to be used anymore.
I gave all this up because I just...
I wanted to clean myself off.
I'm dropping the case.
You can't. It's my life.
It's my life, you can't!
I didn't kill her!
I don't believe you.
What did he say?
- I told you.
- I don't want to hear it.
We got another letter from the 1942 Corona.
I'm sorry to disturb you, your Honour.
It's against all better judgement for me to speak with you.
Please, your Honour.
Did this hypothetical client confess his guilt...
...to his hypothetical lawyer?
Then...
...the defence counsel has no real ethical dilemma.
He took an oath.
He must live up to that oath.
What if he finds that he can't?
Then he had no business taking the oath in the first place.
What if someone came to you...
...under circumstances like these and asked to be dropped from a case?
I probably would accede...
...to his or her wishes.
But...
...with great regret.
Teddy!
What the fuck are you doing in the dark?
Playing with yourself?
Everything okay?
You're going to love what we got on Bobby Slade.
What the hell's the matter with you?
Come on, read it.
Are you okay?
No.
You're not okay. You look like shit.
I'm sorry. Come here.
I'm sorry, kid.
Hear ye, hear ye.
The Superior Court for the County of San Francisco is now in session.
- The Honourable Clark Carrigan presiding.
- Will counsel approach the bench?
Do you have anything you want to say to me, Mrs. Barnes?
Yes, your Honour.
The defence would like to recall
Bobby Slade.
Recall Robert Slade.
Where were you employed before coming to the Hillsborough Country Club?
At the Oceanside Racquet Club in Santa Cruz.
What were the circumstances under which you left there?
- I don't understand.
- I think you do.
You were fired, were you not?
No, I got a better offer from Hillsborough.
Isn't it true that you were fired in Santa Cruz for selling sexual favours?
- That's not true.
- Perjury is a criminal offence, Mr. Slade.
Objection, your Honour.
I presume you know the penalty for committing perjury, Mr. Slade?
That's what they said...
...but there's no proof.
There's nothing on my record.
I wasn't fired. I left.
During the course of your intimate sexual relationship with Mrs. Forrester...
...where did you have sex with her?
Motels. The house in Hillsborough.
- Down at the beach house.
- The house in Baker Beach?
- Yes.
- Where the murders took place.
Did Mrs. Forrester ever pay you for having sex with her?
She was beautiful.
She didn't have to pay anybody.
What kind of sex did you have with her?
What do you mean?
Did you tie her up?
- Objection, your Honour!
- Sustained.
You fucking bitch!
What did you call me?
- I object!
- Denied.
What did you call me, Mr. Slade?
You called me a bitch.
Is that what you called me?
Speak up, Mr. Slade.
Yes.
No further questions, your Honour.
No questions.
The People call Anthony Fabrizi.
It was a 6-inch hunting knife with jags on the edge.
And what locker was it in?
- It was in locker 122.
- And whose locker is that?
It was Mr. Forrester's locker.
Mr. Fabrizi, are you absolutely certain that the knife you saw...
...on January 2, 1984, was in Mr. Forrester's locker?
Yes, I am certain.
Your witness.
No questions.
The People rest.
That will be all, Mr. Fabrizi.
Are you ready to call your first witness,
Mrs. Barnes?
I am, your Honour. We call Duane Bendix.
Who's Duane Bendix?
Were you a member of the Hillsborough
Country Club on January 2, 1984?
Yes, I was.
Was there a knife, on that date, in your locker at the country club?
There was.
What kind of knife was it?
It was a hunting knife with a 6-inch blade and a jagged edge.
Is this the knife?
Yes, it is.
What was your locker number at the club?
No further questions.
Your witness, Mr. Krasny.
No questions.
Thank you.
Your Honour, we would like to recall
Anthony Fabrizi.
Mr. Fabrizi, I'd like to remind you that you are still under oath.
Thank you, Judge.
Mr. Fabrizi.
Are you certain, beyond any doubt, the knife you saw was in locker 122...
...and not in locker 222?
- No, it was in locker 122.
I remember, because I put it together in my head that it was Mr. Forrester's.
Where was Mr. Bendix's locker in relation to Mr. Forrester's?
Well, it's in the row right behind his.
Does this look like the knife you saw that day?
- No, this one's different.
- How is it different?
It's the same kind of knife, but...
...this one here is all scratched up on the sides and the handle's all worn.
If this knife was brand new and hadn't been used for a year and a half...
...would it look like the knife you saw?
Could it have been the knife you saw?
It is possible?
Jesus Christ, I don't know! It's possible!
Your Honour, I'd like this knife marked...
...and admitted into evidence as "Defence Exhibit B."
Your witness.
- Mr. Fabrizi...
- What the hell are you going to ask me?
I told her, it looks different. I don't know.
If it was brand new, sure!
It's possible it's the one I seen.
I don't know how I could've mistaken the locker numbers.
No questions.
Thank you, Mr. Fabrizi. That's all.
We'll adjourn and reconvene again tomorrow morning at 9:00.
- Can I talk to you?
- There's nothing to talk about.
I tried calling you all weekend.
I went over to your place.
You still think I'm guilty?
How can you defend me if you think I'm guilty?
It happens all the time.
It's the way our legal system works.
I bet you're a cold fuck.
What do you want, Mr. Slade?
You really think you're something, don't you?
You twist everything around, don't you?
You just don't give a shit.
I bet I could warm you up.
I bet I could make you real hot.
Jen, hi.
What are you doing?
No, I'm at the office. I just wanted to call.
Why don't you get David to watch
Spiderman while you do your homework?
Okay.
Why don't we talk about that when I get home, okay?
All right, I love you.
'Bye.
Julie Jensen?
- I'd like to talk to you. My name...
- I know who you are.
The Superior Court for the County of San Francisco is now in session.
The Honourable Clark Carrigan presiding.
Mrs. Barnes, call your next witness.
We call Julie Jensen.
Ms. Jensen, where do you reside?
At 1326, Del Mar Lane in Santa Cruz.
Would you describe for us the events that took place...
...on the night of January 21, 1984?
Objection, your Honour.
This testimony is not relevant.
This testimony is directly related to the crimes Jack Forrester is accused of...
...and Mr. Krasny knows it.
The witness may continue.
I was in my bedroom.
I woke up. There was a knife at my throat.
There was a man there.
He was dressed in black.
Pants, a turtleneck.
He wore a black ski mask.
- I never saw his face.
- Objection, your Honour.
- This crime is not relevant to this case.
- Overruled.
He kept the knife pressed to my throat.
It was a big knife.
It had these jags on the top.
He tied my hands and my legs to the bed.
He cut my night-gown off of me.
What did he do then?
He pushed the knife against my nipples...
...and he cut me.
How did he cut you?
He cut around my right nipple with the tip of the knife.
He smeared the knife with...
...the blood and he got up and he wrote it on the wall.
What did he write?
He wrote the word "bitch."
Then he came back to the bed...
...and he started putting the knife...
...between my legs.
But he didn't...
...cut me.
And then he suddenly stopped...
...and he went away.
And these events took place at your beach house in Santa Cruz...
...on January 21, 1984...
...18 months before the murders at Baker Beach?
Yes.
Well done.
Ms. Jensen...
...did you relate these events to anyone from the San Francisco DA's office?
Your Honour, that is irrelevant.
Overruled!
Yes, I did.
To that man there.
To this man? Mr. Arnold?
- An assistant district attorney?
- Yes.
When did you relate these events to him?
He came to see me three weeks after Mrs. Forrester was killed...
...and he came back to see me two days later.
When Mr. Arnold came back to see you, what did he tell you?
He told me that the Baker Beach killings were not related to what happened to me.
Ms. Jensen...
...were you a member of the Oceanside
Racquet Club in Santa Cruz...
...from January to October, 1983?
- Yes.
- Do you play tennis?
I did before this happened.
Did you ever play with the club's pro,
Bobby Slade?
- I object...
- Yes!
Bobby Slade is not on trial here!
Why isn't he?
You knew. You hushed it up.
You are trying to mislead this jury.
That is not true and you know it.
I will see you both in chambers.
All I'm asking for is a two-week continuance.
For what?
To tie him into the Santa Cruz crime?
He's had months to tie him but can't.
He's innocent and you know it.
That's why he didn't turn over her statement to me.
How did you find her? How did you?
She kept her name out of the papers.
- We saw the police report.
- We pulled it.
You pulled the police report?
You've breached the canon of ethics,
Mr. Krasny.
Now, your request is denied.
If it were up to me, I'd vote to disbar you.
He told you, didn't he? He told you.
What did he do? Did he phone you?
- Send you anonymous notes?
- You'll stop at nothing, won't you?
Anyone could've sent those notes.
Everyone knew.
The police knew, people in your office knew.
Bullshit!
Don't you understand what he did?
He did the identical crime
18 months before he murdered his wife.
He knew it would get him off the hook.
He knew Bobby Slade was seeing his wife.
That's why he did the first crime in Santa Cruz.
He threw us Bobby Slade as a suspect.
He picked that woman very carefully.
He knew she played tennis with Slade.
He planned this for 18 months.
He is not a psychopath.
He is an iceman.
He is a monster!
You're the monster, Tom.
If you make any attempt to implicate
Mr. Forrester in the Santa Cruz crime...
...I shall strike it.
He is not charged with that offence.
They're in.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?
We have, your Honour.
Not guilty.
We stand in recess.
I'm proud of you!
I'd like to say something, please.
I'd like to say something, please.
Four years ago, I resigned my job as an assistant district attorney.
I'd like to tell you why.
I prosecuted a case with Mr. Krasny.
It was a very newsworthy case.
The kind of case that wins elections, makes careers.
We convicted the man and he went to jail.
A week after the trial, I discovered...
...that during the trial...
...one of our investigators had come up with evidence...
...which would have exonerated the man we were prosecuting...
...and that Mr. Krasny had buried that evidence.
Although I found...
I didn't do anything.
I didn't tell anyone.
I let that man...
He hanged himself in prison.
I will have to learn to live with that...
...somehow.
The People versus Henry Styles...
...Case Number 26022.
Mr. Krasny, do you have a comment on that?
- We want a statement, please.
- Do you have any comment, please?
Your partners are very proud of you.
This verdict has been a terrific vindication for our legal system.
It couldn't have happened without Teddy Barnes.
Where are you?
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!
What's going on?
We're going to my house to let you celebrate.
I have no one to celebrate with except you guys.
- Yes you do. Come on, you guys.
- Goodbye, Mum.
I feel vindicated,
I think more than anything else.
This verdict has been a great vindication of our system.
It couldn't have happened without Teddy Barnes.
I'll never be able to thank her.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Mr. Forrester.
That's Jack Forrester...
... found not guilty of those brutal murders of his wife and her maid.
That's the situation here.
This word, just in to the Channel 7 newsroom.
Police are seeking Hillsborough
Country Club tennis pro, Bobby Slade...
... for questioning in the Baker Beach killings.
We'll have full details and a film report at 11:00.
Good morning.
- Good afternoon.
- What time is it?
The time is 3:30.
Are you hungry?
- I'm starving.
- I made some brunch down there for us.
I'm going to the stables.
I'll be back in 10 or 15 minutes.
You know how I feel?
I feel free!
Free!
Where are you going?
It's David. He has a fever.
I've got to go home.
No.
Go on, Ed.
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know. Matthew called.
- I'll come with you.
- No. I'll call.
Here, let me try.
Can I at least kiss you goodbye?
Hello? Teddy?
- Yes.
- How's David?
He's fine.
What was the matter with him?
I...
Nothing.
You said he had a fever.
I found the typewriter.
What typewriter?
What are you talking about?
You killed her.
What is the matter with you?
- Teddy, I love you.
- No.
- Will you listen to me?
- No.
- I'm on my way over.
- No!
- Hello?
- Sam?
What the hell's the matter? Are you okay?
- I need to talk to you.
- About what?
Teddy, what is it?
What is it?
What is it?
For Christ's sake, what is it?
Nothing.
I just wanted to...
I just wanted to say thank you.
Thank me?
What the fuck do you have to thank me for, baby?
They got a warrant out on Bobby Slade.
They're going to charge him.
Did you hear me?
I don't want to hear about Bobby Slade.
Are you sure you're all right?
Sure you don't want me to come over?
No.
No, nothing's wrong.
It's all right now.
'Bye, Sam.
I need to see your face, Jack.
I could've loved...
Jesus Christ.
Fuck him. He was trash.
No.
Hey! Where's Howard and the rest of the apprentices?
Left at the bottom to find their own way up. You gotta learn sometime.
You wanna be a troubleshooter, you gotta know the mine.
All clear down there?
Yeah, we won't need these anymore... but I wouldn't go lightin' any matches.
Damn methane. Gonna blow this place to shit one of these days.
We ain't that lucky.
Hey, come on, now!
Knock it off!
- Howard!
- Hey, Howard!
Hey, enjoy your walk up?
Yeah, real cool.
Why didn't you guys wait?
Look, Landers, you better get a lot of exercise... if you're gonna grapple with Gretchen.
Oh, yeah? I got a valentine for her that she's never gonna forget.
Right to the heart, huh?
It's gonna be a hot time on Saturday night!
Stavisky, you do anything else with that... except throw it over your shoulder and burp it?
Aw, get lost, Axel!
Bunch of clowns. Things haven't changed a bit. Same as always.
Bet you wish you never came back.
Especially now since Sarah's goin' out with Axel.
No skin off my nose.
I don't give a damn.
Come on. Last one into town gets the brew! Let's go!
Okay. Let's go, guys!
Quittin' time!
Casanova is here!
- Gretchen, it's me.
- Howard, stay away from me.
- Hi, babe.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- How are ya?
- I'm fine.
- How are you?
- Good to see ya.
Hi, sweetie.
You big lug.
I missed ya.
- Anything I should do?
- No. Of course not.
Gretchen, I want you to be my date for the dance. Okay?
Dry up!
Gretchen, you know what'd look really good on you?
- What?
- Me.
Suck it in and zip it up, will ya?
Gretchen, why fight it?
Let the good times roll!
All right!
Hi, fellas.
Mabel, this is the best thing that's happened to this town in years.
Your decorating committee has done one hell of a job!
Well, after all, the first
Valentine's dance in 20 years... has to be something special.
Yeah, well--
Of course, you're right, Mabel... but we'd all be better off if you played down the fact... that it's the first
Valentine's dance in 20 years... if you know what I mean.
Let's just concentrate on having a good time Saturday night... and put all that other business to rest.
My thoughts exactly, Mayor.
- Hi, guy.
- Aw, come on, you clown!
Help Miss Osborne pick those things up!
What the hell are you kids doing in here?
You're supposed to be decorating the room, not each other.
Where you goin', son?
I always go this time of day... for another beer and a real good nose pick.
I'm sorry, T.J.
I don't think he likes being back in the mine very much.
Well, that's too bad. Nobody told him to go out to the West Coast.
It's not my fault he couldn't make it on his own.
But now that he's back, he's my son and he's working in the mine.
Put those things back... or I'll turn you both upside down, especially you.
This is my date, Chief.
That meeting in Centerville is at 7:00. We should hit the road.
Then let's go.
I'll see you kids later.
Bye, Mabel.
Keep up the good work.
See ya, Chief.
I might as well go too. All of this will have to be rewashed.
I'm really sorry, Mabel.
This is station QPID,
940 on your radio dial.
- Oh! Mayor!
- Country-fried QPID...
from Valentine Bluffs, where the
heartland meets the sea.
Mayor?
Mayor, somebody left this for ya.
- For me? Who was it?
- I don't know.
It was inside when we got here.
Maybe you got a secret admirer, huh?
- You in on this, Mabel?
- I'm afraid not, Mayor.
Oh, no. No, no.
Don't look at me. I didn't have a thing to do with it.
Well, hell.
I've been looking for an excuse... to get off this miserable diet
Mrs. Hanniger has me on.
Thanks, Howard.
If there's one thing I like better than Christmas candy... it's Valentine's candy.
- Have some.
- Hey.
Who sent it?
"From the heart comes a warning... filled with bloody good cheer.
Remember what happened... as the 14th draws near."
It can't be happening again.
It can't be happening again.
It can't be happening again.
It's a bad time, this time of year.
There's bad things coming, my words you hear.
Beware of the 14th if you value your life.
Here we go again. How many times is he gonna tell that story?
Oh, let him tell it.
I love fairy tales.
This ain't no fairy tale, little girl!
If you don't take it seriously, you're a fool!
Ow!
Hurt yourself?
Axel, are you okay?
Oh, no! Let me see.
I know what I'm talking about.
I'm telling you now.
This town is accursed.
It all started 20 years ago.
It was the night
of the Valentine's Day dance...
at the Union Hall.
The biggest event of the year.
It'd been a tradition
for over a hundred years.
Everybody was there,
except for...
seven miners who were out
at the Hanniger Mine.
Five of them
still down below.
Two supervisors were waiting
for the men to come up.
Anxious to get to the party...
they left before the men
were safely out...
failing to check the methane gas
levels in the tunnels down below.
The five men were buried alive...
as the town
continued its party.
For six weeks we dug 'round
the clock to try to save them.
After we broke through,
one man was found alive.
I was the one
who found him.
Harry Warden spent the next year
in the state mental hospital.
Exactly one year later,
on Valentine's Day...
he came back to town.
He killed the two supervisors...
who had left their posts
the year before.
Then he cut out their hearts...
and stuffed them
into heart-shaped candy boxes.
That night at the dance,
we found the boxes...
blood dripping out the sides.
Inside was a note--
a warning from Harry...
never to hold a Valentine's dance
ever again.
Every February 14th,
Harry comes back to town...
his pickax stained with blood...
waiting in the shadows
of the Hanniger Mine...
just for someone to kill...
should they not heed his warning.
It could be you!
I know what I'm sayin'.
Forget about having a party at all on Saturday night... or you may not live to see daylight.
Laugh now... but you'll be sorry you didn't listen to me.
Uh-oh!
Come on, Hap!
Lighten up!
It's a stupid legend.
It gives me the creeps.
All right, you guys.
Who ordered the Moosehead?
I did, you gorgeous slab of female fleshiness.
There is a young barmaid
named Harriet
Who's never been robbed
of her cherry yet
Oh, try as she may
This girl can't get laid
A Valentine virgin
named Harriet
Why did you hit me in the ribs like that?
- Hey, where ya goin'?
- I just want to put on some music.
Be my guest.
Excuse me.
It's your own fault.
You know that, don't you, T.J.?
Never said it wasn't.
Then why can't you accept things the way they are?
Thing is, I don't like the way things are.
Excuse me.
Yes. All right.
Thank you very much.
I have to call in the morning.
The administration office is closed at night.
The nurse that's on duty doesn't know a thing.
She's got to know whether he's there or not!
I just hope this is some kind of joke, and the kids... are just trying to scare us.
If it is a joke, I want every one of those kids strung up... starting with that damn Howard Landers!
Well, it's a human heart, all right.
Ayoung woman.
About 30 years old.
What are you guys doin' with a loose heart?
Looks like a butcher ripped this thing out.
What's goin' on over in Valentine Bluffs?
You remember Harry Warden?
Oh, God, of course I remember.
Those were terrible murders.
God. I thought they locked him up in Eastfield 20 years ago.
- They did.
- Are you sure he's still there?
We'll find out in the morning.
I'm checking on it.
Well, gentlemen, I'd say you have your answer.
It looks like Harry Warden's back in town.
Well, now.
I wonder who sent this.
Jake?
"Roses are red, violets are blue...
One is dead, and so are you"?
No!
No! Get away!
Get away!
No, don't!
Get away! No! No!
No!
This is gettin' really good.
Don't put your nose in it.
Hey, this is what I really call
"junk food."
How much longer, Hollis?
I'm freezin'.
Relax. This thing ain't no microwave.
How 'bout rewin' it up?
- Man, have I got the munchies.
- Yeah, me too.
A little protein patrol, eh, boys?
- Don't go pokin' my meat.
- Oh, come on.
Probably cooked.
- Don't stick your nose in the food.
- It's his. He can do what he wants.
Is that turkey?
I asked for roast beef.
Turkey for the turkey.
Here.
Come on.
Shove over.
- Sure is cold tonight.
- Yeah.
I guess we got ourselves a problem, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess so.
What are we gonna do about it?
Well, there ain't nothin' to do about it.
Sarah's goin' with me now... and that's all there is to it.
I ain't gonna back off for you, T.J.
Nobody asked you to go away, T.J.
Come on, Axel. Don't give me any of that horseshit.
You're beginning to sound like my old man.
Too bad, man.
Look, you left.
You went away, and we didn't know where you were... or when you were comin' back.
I ain't gonna back off for you.
You stay the hell away from Sarah!
All right, all right!
You want a fight, then you got it!
'Cause you and I both know who Sarah wants.
You're kinda hard on him, Teej.
Can't exactly blame him.
Sure it's not his fault.
It's nobody's fault.
I don't know what to do.
You know, I really do like that son of a bitch.
Hey, remember?
Remember how we used to tear this place apart?
Eh? Get drunk, race out to the bluffs.
That was great.
I guess things change, huh?
Nothin' stays the same.
W-A-R-D-E-N.
Harry Warden. He was committed under court order... approximately 20 years ago.
Well, I'm afraid I have no records of a Harry Warden, past or present.
How can that be?
He was committed there, under court order!
I'm sorry. I have no records on him.
In 20 years, any number of things could have happened.
Now, if this Harry Warden was committed, as you say... then he's simply no longer here... and if I have no records on him,
I have to assume... that he's transferred, he's released, or he's on the slab.
One of three, take your pick.
One out of three?
Now, look,
Mrs. Raleigh... you're gonna have to do a little bit better than that.
Now, I have to know what happened to this man... and I have to know what happened to him now!
Now, have you
checked everything?
Everything, except the microfilms over in central file... and it will take several days to check that.
I need answers fast.
I'll be waiting for your call.
Dr. Peyton, 3-5-3.
Jumpin'Je-- They don't even know what the hell happened to him.
What more do we need to know?
It's gotta be Harry.
Maybe we oughta cancel the dance.
Just decide which one you really want.
And now for the big moment.
Will it be number one or will it be number two?
Patty, will you be serious?
This is important.
- You can't have 'em both.
- I don't want them both.
- Oh, no?
- No.
Just what I thought.
Oh, I don't know.
T.J. won't talk to me.
He just sulks all day long.
He ends up making me feel guilty... when he's the one who owes me the apology.
And Axel is not behaving any better.
Oh, Patty, I don't even want to go to the dance on Saturday night.
Oh, but you gotta go.
It'll be all right.
Stay with Hollis and me. Besides, you gotta see the dress I got.
Cut down to here, slit up to there.
I may not get out alive!
Mabel?
Mabel, I gotta talk to you. We got a problem concerning the dance.
Mabel, you back here?
Okay. Little John, I want you and Mike to check the wall.
T.J., take care of the sump.
You get a pump down there, or I ain't doin' it.
You do it, or you get your ass outta here for good.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
What's buggin' him today?
Son of a bitch is after my ass
'cause of Sarah.
- Keeps it up, I'm gonna nail him.
- I said move it, Hanniger!
Oh, yeah.
Come on, man.
Anytime, loser.
Hey, that's it!
Break it up, you two!
T.J., you get your ass up top to 217!
Let go!
There ain't gonna be no fighting in my section, Palmer! Understand?
What an awful smell.
This is like it was
20 years ago.
I can remember those murders just like it was yesterday.
Jake, you gotta get help from Granville.
No, not yet.
Call in Granville, we'll have police crawling all over this place... and we'll have a hell of a panic on our hands.
You just mention that Harry's back... and this town won't be worth the powder to blow it to hell.
Just a minute, boys.
I want you to bring the ambulance around back.
Load her up from there. I don't want anybody in town seeing this.
You remember. Mabel Osborne died of a heart attack, and that's all.
Breathe one word of this to anybody... and you'll have to answer to me.
Wait a minute.
What's this?
Take her away.
"It happened once, it happened twice.
Cancel the dance, or it'll happen thrice."
Well, that's it.
The dance is canceled.
Let's tear every poster, every banner, every decoration... down and out of sight!
I don't want to see a single
Valentine's heart anywhere.
As long as this town is decorated to the hilt...
Harry's gonna keep on killing and--
And get that damn
Union Hall locked up!
All right, Mayor.
No, I'm sorry.
There's nothing I can do about it.
What's goin' on?
The mayor has canceled the dance, and that's all there is to it.
In the light of Mabel's death, he had no choice.
There'll be no parties either.
We owe her that much respect.
Mabel would have wanted us to have the dance.
- She worked so hard on it.
- Yeah, you can't cancel it now.
He's looking for an excuse to cancel the dance.
That's the way it is.
There'll be no dance tomorrow night... and no parties either.
Do you understand me?
Hanniger!
- We have something to settle.
- You bet we do.
Howard, you gotta chew it.
You don't blow bubbles with it.
I'll take care of myself.
How did you ever get to be so stupid?
Come on.
Let's take a shower.
T.J., will you stop this?
I don't wanna go with you!
Are you listening to me?
Nope.
Remember this spot?
Of course
I remember this spot.
Why didn't you write me, T.J.?
Why didn't you call?
I wanted to, believe me, but I couldn't.
I mean, I really fell on my ass out there.
I made so many mistakes.
But I learned something.
Look. Give me a chance.
If you still want me to go away, I will... but I have to tell you that
I love you and I want you back.
How was I supposed to know that,Jessie?
I honestly didn't think you were ever coming back.
You just left me here.
Sarah, please.
I'm sorry.
I'm so damn sorry.
That's what I am
And, girl
I don't expect you to understand
I just play my song
And right or wrong
Now music's all I need
to get along
Women and wine
don't thrill me like they used to
- And I don't feel--
- You seen Sarah?
Ain't my turn to watch after her.
Damn it, Sarah, why do you do this to yourself?
How am I gonna tell Axel?
Sarah!
- Chief Newby.
- I'm sorry I startled you.
It's all right.
- Is something the matter?
- No, I'm--
I'm just making my nightly patrol.
Right.
- Good night, Chief.
- Good night, Sarah.
- Just a-diggin'in my mine
- Beer, Hap.
- I'll take my time makin'you mine
- You hear about Mabel Osborne?
- I'm a part-time lover
- She got it just the way I said.
- Mmm, you're a full-time fool
- Heart attack, my ass!
If we aren't gonna have a Valentine's dance... what are we gonna do?
Why don't we have a Valentine party?
A party!
Where? Newby's got this whole town locked up, bright guy.
- How 'bout my father's mine?
- T.J., are you crazy?
- Come on.
- The mine!
In the mine?
That'd be great.
- It would! What a blast!
- In the mine, that's exactly...
- what it would be.
- It'd be great!
Come on. We got everything we need down there.
Let's see. We got a rec room, we got a pool table, everything.
Yeah, in the mine. Where people get killed and eaten.
Beware of Harry Warden.
Shut the fuck up!
Beware of what you make fun of, you little asshole!
- Who?
- You!
Forget about having a party at all tomorrow night, or you'll be sorry.
Lighten up, Hap.
Piss on Harry Warden and that damn old legend.
We're gonna have ourselves a party.
Don't you go tellin' nobody.
Don't say
I didn't warn you.
That settles it, then!
We're goin' to the mine.
We're gonna have ourselves a party.
- All right!
- Whoo!
You're a full-time fool
Assholes.
Yeah. Damn kids.
I'll show them.
Piss on Harry Warden, will they?
Well, I'll give 'em a scare they'll never forget.
Lights!
Come on!
It's cold out here!
- Hey, it's party time!
- This is great!
Hey, Hollis!
...Saturday night and we'll stick
around till the mornin'light
Let the good times roll
Yeah, let the good times roll
Let the good times roll--
Well, I work all day
just pushin'dirt
Got grease in my hair
coal on my shirt
Hi, Ben. Anything happen?
- No. It's been quiet all evening.
- Good.
That came for you, though.
Oh, my God.
- Get me a coffee, will ya, Ben?
- Yeah, sure, Chief.

Mummy!
He's gone all to pieces and lost his head.
Don't panic, Penfold!
I'm just over here at Fourth Dimension.
- Eh?
- Um... well, my head is.
Look here, you fiend!
I don't know how...
Henry, would you please hurry up!
Okay. Down in a minute.
Same every morning!
Stupid old trains!
Yes, he's removed the door
and the demon to Alpha Centauri.
Hello?
Hello?
Mummy!
Oh, please.
Oh please, stop.
Please. Please, stop!
Please!
You stinking fat bastard!
I'll catch up, don't worry!
Pig!
- Henry, for goodness' sakes!
- Coming!
And this is a model engine.
Let's see what's inside, shall we?
You see, there are four tubes called cylinders,
and inside each cylinder is a kind of plunger called a piston. You see?
Have you got that, Chumley?
The engine has four cylinders,
and inside each cylinder is a plunger called a piston.
Okay, Mr Whoopee, go ahead.
Oh! Well, a little gas and air come into the cylinder.
Now, gas is very, very explosive.
So when a spark plug in the top of the cylinder makes a spark...
Interesting?
Not to you.
Try me.
Come on, Linda. You don't want to know about my hobby.
I can't care if you don't talk to me about it. Can't I?
Hmm?
You baiting me?
Now, why would I do a thing like that?
Chooga-chooga-chuff-chuff...
Hey ho.
Hey ho.
Linda, what's wrong here?
- You'll be late at the clinic.
- Again.
Bye-bye, sugar. See you at six.
- Have a nice day, Henry.
- Bye-bye, sugar. See you at six.
Surprise, surprise.
Come soon.
Oh, come today.
I have to say it.
I don't normally approve of the disfigurement involved in tattoos.
- What?
- But I wholly approve of yours.
It's admirable!
Just what the hell are you trying to say?
The simple word, "Mom".
The way you've got the word "Mom" across the heart like that.
Listen, fella, you just don't jump up a man's truck and start talking about his tattoo.
That's some bad judgement.
I presume you love, or loved, your mother?
What?!
I take it you had feelings of the warmest possible affection for your mother?
Yeah. I did.
Everybody should have a mother.
But I never knew mine.
They took me away when I was only two or three days old.
Where to?
The funny farm?
Yes.
Two days old.
Think of it.
I was born in this country, you know.
I should have had my childhood here.
But they took me away.
"...I don't give a frog shit."
To the Minister! Look, I said,
I've got to live in this town.
At least you don't have to tidy up his toys.
Rather have that.
You ever wish you were someplace else?
Okay, buddy.
This is where you're getting out.
What?
I'm putting you down here.
Erm... but... what?
Listen, fella. You ain't done nothing but run your damn mouth for the last hour and I ain't understood but about half of what you said.
I didn't want you to feel lonely.
Look here, fella, this is a little old biddy town.
There ain't nothing happening here at all.
So they ought to be damned glad to get you.
Now get your ass out.
You think I talk too much.
Is that it?
Nooo!
But that don't matter none, good buddy.
What?
I'm just practising.
I don't want to stand out like a sore thumb, do I?
Who's that mother?
I'm that mother!
Go on, get out!
Thanks.
Well, I guess maybe they're thinking of doing it more like last year.
Always the same.
They just go on and on and on...
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh.
- Good morning, Dr Henry.
- Good morning.
Oh, I didn't notice you, Bernard.
Good morning!
Why don't you try a little harder, Henry?
Pretty soon you'll be able to say
"good afternoon" when you arrive.
You wouldn't happen to have such a thing as egg and chips, by any chance, would you?
- What?
- I mean, erm...
Shit, what do I mean?
Ah, fried egg and French fries.
Sure. How do you want your egg?
- I beg your pardon?
- Easy over, or what?
- Do I have an alternative?
- Do you have what?
That will be fine. Splendid.
Ta very much.
What's "easy over"?
Are you English?
Um... is it that obvious?
I mean, I've scarcely opened my mouth.
You don't mind, do you?
- No.
- Do you?
No. Go ahead.
As long as you don't think I'm being impertinent or anything gross like that, but there's something about your face that sort of reassures me.
- I'm not intrusive, am I?
- No.
- Am I?
- No, of course not.
How do you do, Madam?
My name is Martin.
And spot on, quite right, jolly shrewd.
I'm from England.
I've come all the way across the pond in search of my mama.
Oh, hi. I'm Linda.
Well, welcome to America.
Hey.
- This is my friend Arlanda.
- Hi.
Arlanda.
Arlanda? Isn't that the name of an airport?
Hello, Arlanda. Come in, please!
Are you receiving me, Arlanda?
I don't know. Is it?
Yes.
It is.
Stockholm.
In Sweden, you know.
I'm not sure I like having the same name as an airport.
It's better than a railway station.
What is it? What's the matter?
No, no, nothing.
There's not something on my face, is there?
I haven't got a bogey on my nose, have I?
No.
I remind you of someone, don't I?
- No...
- Don't I? Yes. Yes, I do.
Well, it was real nice meeting with you.
I hope you really have a nice vacation.
- Oh, are you going?
- I'm going.
- But I will see you again, won't I?
- We've got to go.
I will see you.
I will.
- Yeah, we'd better go now, sir.
- I doubt it.
- Excuse me, sir.
- Well, I don't. I certainly don't.
Jesus Christ...
Enjoy.
Shut up!
Piggy.
Little piggy.
No...
Daddy?
Daddykins?
Which ickle-lickle naughty ickle girl wants to be a bad lickle girl?
No, Linda.
Daddy...
Ickle Linda can't go bye-byes.
Not now, Linda.
I've hardly had a wink of sleep.
Ooh, but I'm a naughty ickle girl.
Daddy...
- Daddykins!
- Oh, for goodness sakes! What the hell!
Oh, for Christ's sake, Henry, you're so goddamn boring!
What's the matter, Linda?
Linda, I'm tired.
Chooga-chooga-chuff-chuff!
Linda, would you put the light out?
You know I can't sleep with the light on.
Linda...
He's outside, you know.
He's come back.
He's outside, and he's waiting.
Oh no he isn't!
Linda?
Linda?
Linda?
Linda?
Why are you looking at me like that?
Like what?
It's not exactly a friendly look, now, is it?
Have I, er... upset you in some way?
You sure have.
Daddys'll smackoo.
Daddykins will smack little Linda...
- No! Not that!
- I, uh, I thought that...
My God, Henry. You're so obtuse!
Yes. I guess I am.
I'm not one of your geriatric patients, you know.
No...
You're so used to treating those old has-beens, or... or playing with your trains.
I do not play with my trains.
Well, what do you do with them, then?
Every morning, every evening, it's driving me crazy!
"Unreasonable" is a better word.
You're being unreasonable.
You didn't even use that... that pretty little snowplough
I bought you for your birthday.
It's a Canadian Pacific snowplough.
I don't have a Canadian Pacific loco.
There.
You see? You see?
We know nothing whatsoever about each other. Nothing!
We'll talk about this later.
Henry.
Henry,
I need that child. I want that baby!
Linda...
I'm suffocating.
I'll just die without that baby.
It is not, not,
I repeat, not possible.
We've got this big house.
You're a doctor.
We're good people.
We could give it... him... everything a child could possibly want.
No, Linda.
Love, security, everything.
It is not possible.
I can't go on like this any more.
It's just so empty.
There's no shape. No purpose.
You know very well no agency, no court anywhere is going to allow us to adopt a child, and you also know why.
You cruel bastard!
If you say so.
You're selfish, Henry!
Totally and completely selfish!
Now stop getting yourself worked up.
We've had all this out at least a hundred times.
Why get overwrought?
Bye-bye, sugar.
See you at six.
- I'll kill myself!
- Yeah, yeah, sure...
I'll be at the bottom of the pool!
I mean it!
My baby!
Bastard!
What did you say?
What?
Did I hear the word "bastard" from your fair lips?
It's not a word that I care to hear, myself. Gets too personal.
But, as the Bard said,
"God, stand up for bastards!"
- What the hell are you...
- Hello.
Hello?
What do you mean, hello?
I suppose I ought to have brought a big bunch of flowers.
What do you want?
How did you...
A bouquet of English roses, red and thorny.
No, a bunch of forget-me-nots!
How did you get in here?
What are you doing?
You almost overdid it, didn't you?
No air left in your lungs.
You might even be dead. Hmm?
- What are you...
- You are Mrs Linda Alice Henry, are you not?
- I'll call the police!
- Who used to be Linda Alice Carter.
- Correct?
- How did you...
Look, you haven't told me who you are, or what you want, or what you were doing staring up at this house last night.
You're so much younger, and so much more beautiful than I ever imagined.
Who are you?
I've come a long, long way to find you,
Linda Alice Carter.
Do I know you from...
We were very, very close once upon a time.
As close as close can be.
Do you not remember the tug of my lips on your tender young breast?
I'll do this for you, Nurse Stein, if you'll do the same for me!
Okay, Mr Ennis. Come on, darlin'.
Up on the table.
You got a nice piece there, don't you?
- Nurse Stein, please.
- Jealous, Doc?
- Hey! Never mind that needle!
- I forgot to ask you to call my wife.
You want me to call your wife?
Oho! That's the way it is, huh?
Tell her I'll, well...
I'll be home late.
Very late.
I didn't have an opportunity to, um...
I forgot our little gathering this evening.
You forgot the Trainorama?
Well, one should sometimes be economical with the truth.
I'll do this for you, Nurse Stein, if you do the same for me.
I'll do better than that, Henry.
- Hey!
- Mr Ennis?
Is there something you like about my butt?
- What?
- You want to keep on looking at it?
You want I should keep it stuck up here in the air all day long?
Now, now, now, now, now,
Mr Ennis.
Hold still, please.
Holy shit!
That hurt!
There. That should do nicely.
Our plucky heroes left on their perilous quest.
- Harry felt a little confused.
- Yeah, must be the tropic zone.
Er... no, it's my watch.
Anyway, although they scoured the area,
not a sign of Zero did they find.
No sense in going any further. Let's...
Aren't you the nice lady, then?
Aren't you at all the kind of woman
I always thought you were.
Be so kind as to cast your mind back to the summer of rock and free love.
- What?
- The end of flower power.
Scruffy sods giving each other daffodils and the clap.
Peace, and all that shit.
Remember?
What were you doing then?
I was at school.
Bet you were good at biology.
What?
The reproductive system.
It can't be.
It can't be.
I'm very tired, you know.
I'm very, very tired.
I mean, I've spent all my life looking for you.
As well as all my money.
For God's sake please, who are you?
I'm your little baby boy, Mummy dear.
My baby?
My little pink baby?
Mother...
It's blown the whole building away.
But at least there's my Junior,
my little boy.
I... I don't know whether to believe you or not.
No?
I can't...
- I can't take it all in.
- You abandoned me!
Didn't you?
- I...
- Well?
I had no choice.
I had no choice.
No choice. No choice.
I didn't!
No choice, no rights, no nothing!
I was taken over and humiliated and bullied!
Made to feel the dirtiest, wickedest...
I was a schoolgirl.
Pregnant schoolgirl.
Somebody who didn't know what to do, or where to go, or who to turn to... or how to escape, or nothing!
A very scared little girl, with an overbearing father and a dimwit mama...
Come on, hey.
Come on...
There hasn't been a day since I haven't thought about what happened, or what should have happened.
I spy!
I spy with my little eye something beginning with... B!
What are you do...
Don't be ridiculous!
- Please play with me, Mummy!
- No!
Something beginning with B.
Now, think!
What's the matter?
- What are you pulling a face for?
- Let go of my wrist!
I'm only playing.
How do I know you are who you say you are?
You could have followed me from that diner, or... could have found out about me.
Two days after I was born, which was May 17th, my birthday,
I was given to a middle-aged couple called Brennan.
You know.
She was a cleaning woman in your mum's house.
But within a year... back to England.
With me.
Little me.
Then it's true.
My child! Where's my child?
- There's no reason to fear!
- It's really true!
Underdog is here!
I've got a new cassette
I want to play.
It's the most fantastic...
You sure this isn't going to give you cardiac arrest one of these mornings?
Hurry up. Hurry up!
You want me to lock the door, don't you? Be patient, Doctor.
She wanted me to be daddy again last night.
It just disgusts me.
It does not come easy to me.
It's not what I like at all.
Wait, wait, wait!
There's a terrific bit coming up.
Now!
- I spy with my little...
- No!
Now you cut it out. I mean it!
Hey!
What... where'd you go?
Martin?
Martin?
I'll be all right... be all right.
Be. All. Right.
- Guess who?
- God, you scared me!
Why don't you like games, Mummy?
- Martin loves games.
- Well, I don't!
What's the matter with you, anyway?
Are you out of your mind?
Oh, don't say that.
Don't ever say that.
I've been ill. That's all.
Sort of.
Ill?
How do you mean, ill?
- Where are we going?
- What?
In this nice car.
Where are you taking me?
I hope it's somewhere exciting.
Well, you'll just have to wait and see, won't you?
I'm not a bit like you thought I am, am I?
Eh?
It's the shock just beginning to hit me, I...
- I never thought...
- Something beginning with B.
- What?
- Do you give up?
Well, do you give up?
- What are you talking about?
- Something beginning with B.
You can't guess it, so... you give up.
Right?
Oh, this is no fun.
This is no fun at all.
What sort of mummy are you, anyway?
And where are we going?
- To the clinic.
- What?
- I must see my husband. I have to.
- No!
- Stop it!
- No!
We are not going to any clinic.
Well, my husband is there.
I have to talk to him.
No clinic! No doctors!
Nothing medical whatsoever!
No... maybe not.
Definitely not!
What is it?
Are you going to make up for lost time?
How... how do you mean?
All the years.
All those years.
The lost years.
Martin, how can I?
- I'm sick to death of being grown up.
- What?
You owe me.
Oh, certainly you owe me.
Definitely you do.
- Or am I just the dirty little secret?
- No. Don't say that.
You mustn't say that. You've never been that, not to me.
You can kiss me, if you want.
You can kiss me.
I mustn't get drunk.
Henry says I have to stop drinking.
You never cuddled me, did you?
And you never played peep-bo.
And you never kissed it better.
Kissed what better?
- My knee.
- Oh. Did you...
You never brought me a light in the dark, and you never waited outside the school gate, and you never let me follow your finger along the line of... nice, big words.
Oh please, what words?
"Once upon a time."
All that stuff.
You know, kids' stuff.
- I used to tell you stories in my head.
- Yes, ma'am?
I wasn't talking to you.
- No?
- No.
Did you really?
Did you really and truly?
Yeah.
Snow White, Rumpelstiltskin.
That sort of stuff. Yes.
Would you tell me one now?
Will you tell me one for real?
Will you? Will you?
"Once upon a time..."
Come on. Come on.
"Once upon a time..."
Scary. Excuse me.
She's sitting there talking to herself with tears in her eyes.
Long, long ago, there was a little girl who was as pretty as she was good, and she was so very, very excited,
'cause her mama told her the fair was coming to the town, with wooden horses, going up and down... up...
And the bumper cars... the bumper cars...
There was this young man, he was helping with the bumper cars.
Yeah.
And...
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
No. I can't.
Come on! Oh, come on!
I don't know how to.
I've never done this before.
Please don't. No. Don't.
I've never done this before.
Please...
Come on! Come on baby!
Come on! Come on!
Yes... yes... yes!
Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
What am I gonna do now?
Who shall I tell?
What shall I say?
Oh, you wicked bastard!
My baby...
Would you like a drink, or...?
A drink?
Do you think I should?
Well, no, maybe, um... yes, wash your hands.
Wash my hands?
Do I have to wash my hands?
Not... not if you don't want to, I...
- I just thought that...
- Are you going to make me?
- Look, why are you behaving like this?
- I don't want to wash!
I don't want to! And I won't!
I won't! I won't!
Now, Martin, stop this this minute, do you hear me?
I mean it!
- Am I a naughty boy?
- Yes, Martin, you are!
Come here!
Are you going to make
Martin go bye-byes?
Are you going to put me to bed?
Are you?
Mummy.
Mummy.
Do forgive me, Bernard.
I know you said to come at once, but old Mrs Hanwell was being more than usually difficult.
And, well, here I am.
- Mrs Hanwell?
- Yes.
- Varicose veins, isn't it?
- Yes. Varicose veins.
No, amend that. Varicose brain.
Well, do sit down. Please.
Yes. Thank you.
- Er... is it anything in particular?
- No, in general.
Nothing serious, I trust?
- Doctor Henry...
- Mmm.
- What's the matter?
- Doctor? Rather formal, Bernard.
At eleven-fifteen this morning, you gave Mr Ennis an injection.
- Yes.
- Could you tell me what it was?
Ooh, er...
Penicillin, yes.
I thought he had...
- You know what this is?
- Yes, of course.
Then read it.
I should have checked, of course.
But I...
But?
Well, I know, of course I'm sorry...
Mr Ennis quite rightly says your mind is not entirely on your work.
- Well...
- How's your wife nowadays, Henry?
She's, er...
Perhaps your domestic situation is affecting your professional life?
I don't think so.
I don't think you have any right to say these things, Bernard.
No?
Everybody makes the occasional error.
Oh.
By the way, I'm going to have to let Nurse Stein go.
You understand my meaning?
Ah... I, er... you're referring to... my therapy..., I...
Therapy?
Your therapy?
Is that what you call it?
Er... s-s-sciatica.
The sciatic nerve.
- Extremely...
- Painful, yes.
He never does anything interesting.
Poor Henry.
Very, very nice, but... boring.
What you marry him for, then?
Mummy?
I needed to. That's all.
Hey!
- What are you doing?
- Playing.
I'm playing.
I like playing!
Yes...
I've decided to have my American childhood.
What?
I am entitled to an American childhood.
...trying to get the crowd wound up here a little bit.
They're having a great time.
Look at the smiles on their faces.
Ball of energy today.
Maybe next year, if we're here for the parade still...
Spoiled!
Choo-choo!
Pampered!
Over-indulged.
The whole package, as you people say.
I've been utterly fed up with being a grown-up for a long time now.
What do you mean?
There's no fun in it.
There's no magic.
There's not even any marbles, or kites, or bedtime stories.
There's nothing.
But that's how it...
What?
Just... yakety-yak!
Yakety-yak!
About bombs, and interest rates, and... stuff like that, from old geezers with prostrate trouble... fucking up the world.
Being a kid again is as good an occupation as any.
It's better.
In fact, it's a pretty good career!
Like Princess Diana.
That what you mean?
Got to work at it.
You can't expect it to be easy.
I'm going to try really hard.
Who wants to dig prostate glands out all day, anyway?
On my terms. In my way.
You've compromised my dignity.
- Looking forward to the speech. I really am.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Hell, I've been looking forward to this evening for so long.
I mean, the honour of the keynote address and everything.
- But now...
- I didn't call her.
What? What do you mean?
Why? Why not?
- It's time we stopped pretending.
- Look, I'm all strung up.
I've lost my job.
I'm worried about this speech.
Bull!
I'm not backing out, but this has got to be done my way.
- Bull!
- Bull?
This is it. You either leave that neurotic drunk or...
Or what?
Or I'll never lay another finger on you again.
Mummy!
Mummy!
Mummy!
And now, without further ado, let me introduce our national leader,
Doctor Henry Henry!
Thank you, thank you!
When the ignorant and the ill-informed say to me, and they sometimes do say to me, if they can find the time to empty their heads from the soap and the football on TV, when they say,
"Fancy! A grown man,
"a doctor, playing with toy trains."
- Do you know what I feel?
- What do you feel?
- Shall I tell you what I feel?
- Tell us!
I feel damned sorry for them!
Yes,
I'm proud of my model railroad!
Yes!
I'm proud of the mental discipline.
The intellectual hygiene of perfectly scaled miniaturisation.
For there, in the layout, is the record writ small of what built this great nation!
Shining tracks from shining shore to shining shore.
Whoo!
Okay!
And I say to you, I say... as I close my eyes at night, the day's work done, the troubles all at bay,
I see a picture of my little train coming down the track, a picture of long ago, when we knew who we were!
What we were!
And where we were going!
Thank you, thank you.
Pardon me...

Yeah, yeah! I'll catch you on the way back.
Out of the darkness she comes...

God bless the model railroaders of America!
Bastions of innocence!
Of decency!
Of healthy family life!
Mummy...
- You can't catch me!
- Yes, I can!
I won! I won!
Yes, you did!
I'm fast, I am.
Mmm, aren't you a clever one?
Am I a good boy?
Am I?
Am I?
I don't know.
Won't play.
Oh, please!
Well...
I feel like I've turned some sort of corner.
You know that guy who was talking to me after my speech?
Truman.
He runs a modelling factory.
Makes everything from locos to little animals.
Including hogs?
The point is, he's offered me a job.
If I can p-p-put up...
Er... he's undercapitalised.
- Nasty complaint.
- Yes.
Well... of course,
I'd have to relocate.
And you, too.
What do you mean?
Well... up there, on that platform, all those upturned faces loving me.
They did. They truly did.
Made me realise a few things.
Personal things.
- Like what?
- Like knowing who I am.
What I want, and who I want.
Especially who.
- Or is it whom?
- Who?
It's not whom?
I've never known about that one.
Grammar's always been a problem for me, and yet you can't say that
I'm not well educated...
Henry!
What's the matter now?
- Who, Henry? Who?!
- If you say so.
Oh! Oh!
Well, you, of course.
You, my dear.
Who else?
You're my... inspiration.
My little choo-choo.
My cuddly caboose.
Yes, yes.

You liked that, didn't you?
Yeah.
You did.
Come on.
I'm going now.
I'm going to smash up the trains.
Bye-bye, Mummy.
Good boy.
Smash 'em up.
Oh, I love you.
We should have gone to the left of this island.
About a mile back.
Arlanda?
Oh, Arlanda, thank God!
Arlanda, help me.
- Arlanda, please come over.
- What?
- Please. You have to. Come now.
- Now?
Yes. Okay!
Are we gonna be completely marooned?
I mean, no visitors at all?
You didn't say anything to Betty?
I didn't say anything to a soul, honest.
Well, have a nice voyage to nowhere.
I'll see you in a day or two.
Don't get lost on the way home.
Linda?
Linda?
Linda, are you there?
What is it, Linda?
Keep your voice down.
- Come on. Quickly, this way!
- What... what's happened?
Shhh! Quietly.
...be able to stand all this shattering peace and quiet?
- Oh my God!
- Don't you worry about Nancy.
I don't know what to do, I...
- I think I'm going out of my mind!
- Well, whatever's happened, Linda?
Where's Henry?
I don't know! He...
He should have been home hours ago!
I shouldn't get so excited, I expect he's been delayed at the clinic.
Have you called him?
Look. Come on, now.
Come on, sit down.
Come on.
Just sit down, now.
Sit down, and we'll just talk about it.
- I don't want him to hear us.
- Who?
Oh, I'm scared. I am so scared.
What are you talking about?
I... I think he might have...
I think he might have broken poor Henry's trains.
- I don't think he likes Henry.
- Who? Who has? Who doesn't?
Oh... and Henry...
Henry will be heartbroken and then he'll blame me.
He'll say I did it!
- Linda...
- He came to the door, I...
I mean, to the pool.
And suddenly... he was just standing there.
- Who was?
- I had to let him in.
- I had to. Had to. Had to.
- Linda.
That young man. Yesterday.
At the hamburger place.
- That Englishman.
- What?
Wait a minute. What have you been up to, Linda?
Oh, now, come on.
You ain't that scared.
I had to. I had to.
Had to. Had to.
Linda?
When you've kept something down inside you for so long, so very long it isn't easy to bring it all out in the open.
I... I don't really know how to tell you.
Even you, my best friend.
Tell me what, Linda?
On my fifteenth birthday...
Go on. Go on.
Well, we went to the travelling fair.
My friends, my school friends,
in the field outside the town.
There was this guy on the bumper cars...
I mean, he ran them, I suppose.
Red cars,
green cars, blue ones...
Don't you just love the way the sparks fall down from the top of those poles?
- With a crack, and a hiss, a phuzzzzt!
- What?
Ah, phuzzzzt!
Electric!
That's just the way he was.
Electric!
Bumper car man.
The others, they got bored and drifted away.
He wasn't interested in them, anyway.
I was the prettiest.
I always was the purty one.
Yes, I was!
But, Lindy, why are you telling me all this?
I kind of hung around.
Letting him come on to me.
Wait a minute, now.
- All the time.
- You proposition me.
- The distance, and...
- You, instead of Nancy. the fairground music was... was churning...
Now, your husband...
Churning about.
It was as if it was inside my stomach.
- God. It made my legs go weak!
- But he ain't never gonna forget it!
This sounds like True Confessions, with a soundtrack.
I'm sorry. I... I'm sorry.
- ♪ When the red red robin comes... ♪
- What?
The music.
In the distance.
Oh, that music!
♪ Comes bob-bob-bobbin' along ♪
Come on!
No. I kept saying no!
No! Don't! Don't!
"Come on, baby!
"Come on! Come on!"
Ah! Ah!

Lindy. Lindy!
What has any of this have to do with anything, Lindy?
Linda?
Linda?
Listen!
- What... what?
- Shh!
- Why are we listening?
- There were footsteps.
- Are you sure?
- On the stairs!
- Did you hear it?
- No. I don't think so. It wasn't...
The back door!
For Christ's sakes, Linda, cut it out, you're scaring me!
Jesus...
He's gone.
He's gone away.
I knew he wouldn't stay.
Who's gone?
They always take him away from me.
Who's gone?
Go and look, Arlanda.
Go look.
Please. Please do this for me.
Listen, Linda, I don't know what the hell's wrong with you, but what the fuck are you talking about?
Please, please, please, Arlanda.
Go and see if Henry's trains, I...
I think I might have done something to them.
- You?
- Yes. Me. I...
I think I might have smashed up his fucking trains.
I tell you, this is giving me the creeps.
I mean, I don't know what you're playing at.
But, if it makes you happy...
Hello, Arlanda.
Did I scare you?
Oh, Henry. Thank God you're here!
What's the matter?
It's Linda...
Linda.
- Oh, my God.
- Linda... look at me.
Look at me.
- Poor ickle Henry.
- Stop it!
Please, Linda, stop it at once.
Henry, what's wrong?
What's happening to her?
She's crazy. That's all.
Totally loco.
Henry!
You have no idea.
- You just don't know.
- But, Henry...
Do you think you could make her a hot drink?
- Chocolate or something.
- Why, yes, of course. Anything.
Thank you.
Poor thing.
Hot drink, yes...
Poor ickle Henry Henry.
You bitch. You crazy boring idiot! Stop it!
Do you hear me, stop it at once!
Shut up! Shut up!
Choo-choo.
- What?
- Choo!
What do you mean?
Are you referring to my trains?
Chooga-chooga-chuff-chuff!
Henry! Get off!
I know what I'm doing.
I know what I'm doing!
They wouldn't even let me stay in school.
After all, I am a doctor.
They took him away from me.
They... they pulled him out of me.
And then they... they pulled him out of my arms.
He didn't even cry or anything.
He was only just born, you see.
Yes, he did, he did cry.
I heard him. Just once.
They said God would punish me.
My Daddy said, "Punish! Punish!"
You haven't done anything to my trains, have you?
- For Christ's sakes!
- You're probably in on this with her.
I know what you women are like.
If there's one thing
I've learnt in this world it's that women and trains don't mix.
Listen, buster. You're the crazy one, going on about your toys like this!
- Toys?! Toys?
- I couldn't buy him any toys.
Why shouldn't he play with yours, Henry?
If you've...
I'm going to go see if you...
Oh, Linda.
Linda, I just don't know what to do.
I don't know how to help you.
- Help me?
- Well, if I could.
- You want to help me?
- Well, of course I do.
The only way to help me now,
Arlanda, is to remember.
Remember everything you've seen and heard here tonight.
Lock it in your head.
Write it down.
Well... what... why?
- Linda, I...
- Arlanda, please.
Before Henry comes back down.
- Yes, but...
- Um, really, I know what to do now. Bye.
Linda! Linda!
Come here,
I want to talk to you.
No more clinics. No more drunks!
Linda! Come here at once!
Do you hear!?
Well, I didn't do it.
It wasn't me.
I told you he'd come back to me.
I always told you my baby would come back to me.
Linda? Where are you?
Here, Daddy...
Linda?
Linda?
All aboard!
Linda!

Mr. Murray? yes. yes. yes. this woman bore a remarkable resemblance to you, miss McGovern. miss McGovern.
Julie rose.
Julie rose. precisely. precisely. she shared the knowledge of the murder with me during one of our sessions.
I prescribed an unorthodox, but profitable form of therapy. but profitable form of therapy. blackmail. it was all going so well... it was all going so well... until Julie s sister did something
I did not expect. she had
Julie murdered... she had
Julie murdered... in a parking lot... on new year's eve. on new year's eve. the videotape. the videotape. exactly. exactly.
Mr. Murray was on his way to meet her, but he was too late to save her. but he was too late to save her. he was able to retrieve the body and dispose of the car before the authorities arrived. before the authorities arrived. when he got the corpse back here, we noticed... we noticed... it was missing the ring finger on her left hand. on her left hand. apparently,
Julie s sister had the killer remove it as proof of his accomplishment. as proof of his accomplishment. you're going to kill me, aren't you? you're going to kill me, aren't you? why, not at all. why, not at all. but Julie s sister might. but Julie s sister might. you see, miss McGovern, your excellent performance convinced her that Julie is still alive. that Julie is still alive. she wishes it wasn't so. she wishes it wasn't so. she will pay a great deal for a second chance. for a second chance. in chess, miss McGovern, second chances are rare... second chances are rare... but very valuable. there. that's not too tight, is it? that's not too tight, is it? this, my dear, will make you drowsy. no. no. no,
I don't want it!
I don't want it! no. no, please. no. this will all make it easier to fix, my dear. to fix, my dear. come back here! come back! my god, please help me! please help me!
I m the one who called! please! they're trying to kill me! they're trying to kill me!
I m glad you're here. who's trying to kill you? dr. Lewis: hello, tom. don't mind Julie. she's a patient of mine. delusional and very agitated. no! she doesn't know what she's saying,
I m afraid. he's lying! don't believe him! he's lying! he's crazy. they're trying to kill me! all right, all right. he's trying to kill me. you can't believe him!
Julie, please try to keep calm. she has these fits. help me, please! don't listen to him! it's all right, tom. she's only dangerous to herself. last night she got hold of a steak knife and cut off her own finger. no! no, they did this to me! let go of me! it took us all morning to suture the wound, didn't it, Julie? don't call me that. my name is
Katie McGovern. tom, do you want to see her papers? here. this is the statement of her admission to mercy psychiatric institute. that's not me! she was admitted there last winter. please, look closely. that's not me. they made me look like her. please, it's not me! please, it's not me! please, you can't believe him! oh, god. you can't believe... oh, no. dr. Lewis: this is very sad...
Julie rose is dead.
Julie rose is dead. her corpse is in the attic. go look in the attic! go look in the attic! please! look in the attic. sometimes her imagination gets the better of her. please! go look in the attic. she'll be all right in a few minutes. hmm. maybe we ought to take a look.
I don't think you should encourage her.
I think we should leave. look, john, put the lady's mind at rest. go up--
I really don't think it's not necessary. it can't hurt. it might calm her down.
I m gonna have to write out a report anyway. all right.
Mr. Murray... take the officers to the attic. take the officers to the attic. the attic? the attic? of course, sir. right this way. right this way.
I am sorry you had to come out on such an awful day. well, it's part of the job. well, it's part of the job. are you sorry, Julie? are you sorry, Julie? it's not heated. it's not heated. would you look at that. what?
I haven't seen one of those things in years. oh, dr. Lewis was once quite a hunter. he wouldn't need to be much of a hunter with one of those. with one of those. oh, uh... oh, uh... oh. oh.
I m going to have to get a repairman in here. look. she tore this wire right out when she had her attack this morning. when she had her attack this morning. dr. Lewis doesn't seem to think there's much hope for her. there's much hope for her. lovely, isn't it?
90 years old.
90 years old. made for president McKinley. that right? poor man never got to play on it, though. shot dead in Cleveland the day it was delivered to the white house. you play? now and then. someday you must come by and we'll have a game. and we'll have a game. well? there's nothing up there. there's nothing up there. what? what? it was there. it was.
I saw her. oh, god.
Mr. Murray, take her back to her room and see that she remains there. no. no, please. no. no, please. come on. come on. they're going to kill me. please, they're lying. please, they're lying. madness is a terrible thing. madness is a terrible thing. no. no. no. no. no. no. aah! aah! aah! aah! aah! aah!
I wonder sometimes why I don't just give up on her. stubborn, I guess. stubborn, I guess. rob: it wasn't making any sense. she kept talking about goldfish.
Roland: huh? goldfish! rob it's got to be this next exit. why? because according to this, there are only
6 covered bridges in this part of new York state. yeah? so? only 4 of them go anywhere near the thruway. right. according to this,
Katie said she was on the road about a few hours. right. let's figure somewhere between 2 and 4. ok! ok! so, of the 4 you can get to off the highway, one is only an hour from the city.
2 are 5 hours away, minimum. the only other one is just east of here. it's about 1/2 a mile away from the next exit. you sure? gotta be. why didn't you say something? why didn't you say something? thank you for taking such good care of my sister. she's been through so much recently. you have a visitor.
Julie.
Julie.
I don't think she can hear us.
I don't think she can hear us.
Julie, dear... so good to see you again. so good to see you again.
Mr. Murray, would you please take her upstairs? upstairs? up we go. up we go. grrr! grrr! she became quite agitated when she heard you were coming. when she heard you were coming. it was necessary to sedate her. it was necessary to sedate her.
Julie s told me so much about you...Evelyn.
Julie s told me so much about you...Evelyn.
I can imagine. would you care for a glass of sherry? would you care for a glass of sherry? a brandy, perhaps? a brandy, perhaps? nothing? nothing? there is no reason to be so downhearted. there is no reason to be so downhearted. after all, you are getting exactly what you want. she is all yours... when I have what I want! now where is it? now where is it? nearby. you've been told to bring it with you.
I ve never been one to do what I was told. didn't Julie tell you that? didn't Julie tell you that? you grossly underestimate me, my dear. my dear.
I do have something for you.
I do have something for you. what is it? what is it? a gamesman to the very end. a gamesman to the very end. oh, I admire that. perhaps I ll have that sherry after all. that's the spirit. that's the spirit. she's resting comfortably, dr. Lewis. she's resting comfortably, dr. Lewis. every town around here is called pine something. there's pine valley, pine ridge, pine lake. damn! damn! here you go. hang on a sec. be right back. hang on a sec. be right back. what's he doing? come on, come on, come on. let's get out of here. let's get out of here. free with every
$10 purchase. free with every
$10 purchase.
Evelyn, you must understand that in any game there can be but one victor. it is a role
I ve grown accustomed to over the years. now, where is the locker?
Katie: aah! go and see, Murray. what about--
Mr. Murray!
Mr. Murray! perhaps the game isn't over yet. perhaps the game isn't over yet. oh, dear! oh, dear! dr. Lewis: run, you fool! get her! get her! she went this way. go, man! down in the field! go, man! catch her. catch her. catch her. catch her. do you see her? only her blanket. only her blanket. is that her?
I don't see any sign of her.
I don't see any sign of her. that's all? yes! yes! come back. but she must be here somewhere. come back. come back. hello, Julie. hello, Julie. it's been a long time. it's been a long time. please.
I m not Julie. you're not? you're not? no.
I m an actress. this was all arranged by dr. Lewis. this was all arranged by dr. Lewis. your sister's dead. your sister's dead. is she? yes.
I can prove it to you. just come with me to the attic.
I ll show you her body. you want me to come to the attic with you? yes, please, before they come back. yes, please, before they come back. why should I trust you? just look at me. listen to me. can't you see
I m not her? can't you see
I m not her? poor Julie. still playing make-believe. still playing make-believe. the guy you're lookin' at. that guy. that's the guy that picked her up in the city. ok, let's say he did. it was about 4:30 in the afternoon, it was almost dark. ok. then what? then they disappeared. who's that? what do you mean? who's she? that's her. that's my wife.
I m sure she is, but that's not the girl I saw. but that's not the girl I saw. look, why don't you just give us the address. we'll go there ourselves.
I can't do that. what is wrong with you people?! she said they were going to kill her!
Christ, they cut off her finger!
Christ, they cut off her finger! oh. oh, get in. get in! she's in here. she's been here the whole time. come on. move! move!
I don't pay you for that!
Evelyn.
Evelyn.
Evelyn.
Evelyn.
Evelyn.
Evelyn. finished playing in the snow? your sister is a resourceful woman. my sister's a fool, and so are the two of you.
I ll find her myself. quickly. keep them apart. you shouldn't wander around up there all by yourself.
I mean, it's a pretty old house, and you don't know your way around, so why don't you go back down there and let me look for her. you must trust me. you know, trust. you hear? that's the foundation of relationships... that's the foundation of relationships...
I ll find her.
I really will. see, there's no back stairs to this house. it's the only way she could get out. oh, I ll find her, wherever she is. there isn't a place to hide in this house that I don't know about. oh, yes. no, please. if we do find her, you let me handle her. dr. Lewis wants you to stay away from her. oh, he's been so worried about things recently. sometimes people worry when they really don't have anything to worry about at all.
I learned a long time ago that worrying doesn't help one bit. that worrying doesn't help one bit. miss McGovern. there. oh. where can she be? where can she be? she wouldn't go back in here, would she? she wouldn't go back in here, would she?
Evelyn. look, you stay right against that door. you just stay there. you just stay there. oh. oh, she has caused so much trouble.
I, for one, am going to be very glad when you've killed her, and this is all over with. after what she's done,
I could kill her myself! after what she's done,
I could kill her myself! she's got to be here somewhere. hmm? so, how do you plan to do it? a rope? a knife? oh, you don't have to tell me.
I was just curious. if you don't mind,
I do have a suggestion. use a piece of cord-- strong, nylon cord. that's what I d use. there's no blood. there's no blood. you know... you know... aah! aah! miss McGovern? miss McGovern? miss McGovern. miss McGovern. dr. Lewis? did you find her? did you find her?
Mr. Murray is still looking for her, but she's obviously not in the house. she has to be. we'll find her. the two of you have let her escape. the two of you have let her escape. impossible. impossible. she must be here. she must be here.
I m going home. call me... call me... call me when you find her... if you find her. we have found her... miss McGovern! miss McGovern! there's no way out. there's no way out. oh! ohh... ohh... hunting weather. hunting weather.
I know what the cold can do.
I ve seen it. it's only a matter of time. it's only a matter of time. aah! aah! aah! aah! there is nowhere to go, miss McGovern. there is nowhere to go, miss McGovern. it's all over. it's all over. the game is over. the game is over. aah! aah!
Katie?
Katie? oh, Katie. oh, Katie.
Your move: Bishop to knight four.
My move: Knight to rook three.
Poor baby, you're starting to lose it, aren't ya?
Your move: King to rook one.
My move: Rook to knight six.
Checkmate. Checkmate.
You cheating bitch.
- Childs, what's he doing?
- Circling the camp.
Who is he?
- Said "Norge" or something on the side.
- It's Norwegian.
- George, are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.
- Are you?
- Yeah. What's going on there?
Watch it.
Easy.
Easy, easy, easy. Yes.
First goddamn week of winter.
Oh, come on. Four stitches.
Barely grazed you.
What were they doing flying that low, shooting at a dog, at us?
Stir-crazy. Cabin fever. Who knows?
U.S. Number 31, calling McMurdo.
Come in. Over.
U.S. Number 31, calling McMurdo.
Urgent. Come in. Over.
Great.
- Come on, come on.
- Nobody!
Nobody. Get a hold of somebody.
Get a hold of anybody.
We gotta report this mess.
Look, I haven't been able to reach shit in two weeks.
I doubt if anybody's talked to anybody on this entire continent, and you want me to reach somebody!
Maybe we're at war with Norway.
I was wondering when the El Capitan was gonna get a chance to use his popgun.
- How long have they been stationed there?
- It says here only eight weeks.
Well, that's not long enough for guys to go bonkers.
Bullshit, bwana. Five minutes is enough to put a man over down here.
Damn straight.
I mean, look at Palmer.
He been the way he is since the first day.
How many in their party?
They started with 10.
There'd be eight others left.
How do we know? Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.
- Nothing we can do about that.
- Yes, there is. I wanna go up.
- In this weather?
- Bennings?
Winds are gonna let up a tad next couple of hours.
A tad?
Can't condone it much myself, but it is a short haul.
An hour there, an hour back.
Shit, Doc, I'll give you the lift.
No problem.
- Forget it, Palmer.
- Hey, thanks for thinking about it though.
Loaded with kerosene. I count 15 cans.
MacReady! Mac, get your gear on!
- Mac, it may not clear up for a week.
- Yeah.
- We're the closest ones to them.
- It's all right by me, Doc.
I'm just letting you know we're taking a chance.
Quit the griping, MacReady.
Those clouds keep moving over the sun, we're gonna get a whiteout.
We get caught in that, you can scratch one doctor and one pilot.
This is real thin.
It'll clear as soon as you get up.
It's up to you, Mac.
If you don't wanna fly, we don't fly.
You really wanna save those crazy Swedes, huh?
Norwegians.
- Which way, Doc?
- Southwest.
You're gonna have to read the map.
'Cause I'm gonna be busy.
Mac's really taking it up, huh?
He knows what he's doing.
Nauls, will you turn that crap down?
I'm trying to get some sleep.
I was shot today.
Read, bwana. Will do.
Writing's on the wall
Very superstitious
Anybody there?
Hey, Sweden!
They're not Swedish, Mac. They're Norwegian.
Mac!
My God. What the hell happened here?
Come on, Doc.
- Portable video unit. Anything?
- It's all in Norwegian.
What are you doing, Doc?
Could be important work.
I wanna take it back.
Well, it's getting late. Let's hurry it up.
I'll check out the last few rooms.
Hey, Copper, come here!
Maybe they found a fossil, the remains of some animal buried in the ice, and they chopped it out.
- But where is it?
- Look at this.
What is that?
Is that a man in there or something?
Whatever it is, they burned it up in a hurry.
Help me find a shovel, Doc.
We found this.
Jesus Christ.
Blair, I'd like you to start an autopsy right away.
Did you reach anybody yet?
Reach anybody?
We're a thousand miles from nowhere, man, and it's gonna get worse before it gets better.
Well, stick to it, Windows. Stick to it.
Nothing wrong with this Norwegian, physiologically anyway.
No drugs, no alcohol. Nothing.
Well, what we got here is what appears to be, anyway, a normal set of internal organs.
Heart, lungs, kidneys, liver.
Intestines.
Seem to be normal.
One, door number two and door number three.
And I think that Dawn Screen here has got the one to trade in the most.
I went to you first.
You brought your friend Anna.
You've been consulting Anna all through the show anyhow.
You may as well consult her one more time.
I know how this one ends.
Clark, will you put this mutt with the others where he belongs?
Yeah, okay.
Go ahead.
Go ahead. What are you waiting for?
I don't know what the hell's in there, but it's weird and pissed off, whatever it is.
Bennings, go get Childs.
What is this? What's going on?
- Hey, Palmer, what is this?
- I don't know.
- Childs, Mac wants the flamethrower!
- Mac wants the what?
- That's what he said. Now, move!
- Damn it.
- Stay back.
- Hey, Mac, what is it?
- Don't! No!
- Get away!
Get back! Get back!
Get your ass over here!
Burn it.
Damn it, Childs. Torch it!
Oh, my God.
Oh!
Look. Son of a bitch. Oh.
You see, what we're talking about here is an organism that imitates other life-forms, and it imitates them perfectly.
When this thing attacked our dogs, it tried to digest them, absorb them, and in the process, shape its own cells to imitate them.
This, for instance... that's not dog.
It's imitation.
We got to it before it had time to finish.
Finish what?
Finish imitating these dogs.
Easy, easy. Good.
Easy, easy.
- Clark.
- Yeah?
Did you notice anything strange about the dog, anything at all?
Strange? No.
What was the dog doing in the rec room?
I don't know.
He was just wandering around camp all day.
Are you saying to me the dog wasn't put in the kennel until last night?
Right.
How long were you alone with that dog?
I don't know. An hour.
Hour and a half, maybe.
What the hell you looking at me like that for?
- I don't know.
- What?
I don't know. It's probably nothing.
It's nothing at all.
How much more of this crap is there?
Oh, about nine hours, I'd say.
- We can't learn anything from this.
- Guess not.
Where'd they take these shots?
Seems like they were spending a lot of their time in a little place northeast of their camp about five or six miles.
What's that?
It looks like something buried under the ice.
And look at that.
They're planting thermite charges.
Whatever it was, it was bigger than that block of ice you found.
Here. This is it. The place where they were spending most of their time.
- Pretty nasty out, Mac. 35 knots.
- Screw it. I'm gonna go up anyway.
Half a mile due east.
Jesus, how long do you figure this has been in the ice?
Well, the backscatter effect's been bringing things up from way down around here for a long time.
I'd say... I'd say the ice it's buried in is
100,000 years old, at least.
- And those Norwegians blew it up?
- Yeah.
I don't know.
Thousands of years ago, it crashes, and this thing...
Gets thrown out or crawls out, and it ends up freezing in the ice.
I just cannot believe any of this voodoo bullshit.
Childs, it happens all the time, man.
They're falling out of the skies like flies.
Government knows all about it. Right, Mac?
Do you believe any of this voodoo bullshit, Blair?
Childs. Childs. Chariots Of The Gods, man.
They practically own South America.
I mean, they taught the Incas everything they know.
Come on, now, MacReady.
The Norwegians get a hold of this, and they dig it up out of the ice.
Yes, Garry, they dig it up.
They cart it back.
It gets thawed out, wakes up, not in the best of moods.
- I don't know. I wasn't there.
- Which one of you disrespectful men been tossing his dirty drawers in the kitchen trash can, huh?
From now on
I want my kitchen clean, germfree.
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice?
- And how could it look like a dog?
- I don't know how.
'Cause it's different than us, see?
'Cause it's from outer space.
What do you want from me? Ask him.
You buy any of this, Blair?
Mac, removing those things out of the lab into the storeroom.
Can you come get your stuff?
Be there in a minute, Doc.
Through the door.
Right over here. Right over...
Sorry, Mac. You have to move your stuff...
Doc says we gotta lock him up.
Stash him in here and lock him up.
- I have to talk to you.
- I'm tired of talking, Fuchs.
I just wanna get up to my shack and get drunk.
- Mac, it's important.
- What is it?
- Outside.
- It's 40 below outside.
In the Thiokol. Please, Mac.
- We ought to just burn these things.
- Can't burn the find of the century.
That's gonna win somebody the Nobel Prize.
You got the keys?
Get them from Garry.
I wanna get some stuff out of here.
There's something wrong with Blair.
He's locked himself in his room, and he won't answer the door.
So I took one of his notebooks from the lab.
- Yeah?
- Listen.
"It could have imitated a million life-forms on a million planets.
"Could change into any one of them at any time.
"Now it wants life-forms on Earth."
It's getting cold in here, and I haven't slept in days.
Wait.
"It needs to be alone and in close proximity with a life-form to be absorbed.
"The chameleon strikes in the dark."
- So is Blair cracking up, or what?
- Damn it, MacReady.
"There is still cellular activity in these burned remains.
"They're not dead yet."
Let's go, Bennings. I gotta get some sleep.
Holy shit.
Go get the doc.
I'll get Garry. We'll meet in Blair's room.
It's Bennings!
Bennings was right there.
Mac, I swear to God. It had a hold of him.
Windows! Windows! Keep away from him!
Get back! Stay back!
It isn't Bennings.
My God, what was happening to him?
If it had more time it would have looked, sounded and acted like Bennings.
I don't know what you're saying.
That was one of those things out there trying to imitate him, Garry.
- Come on.
- MacReady, I know Bennings.
I've known him for 10 years. He's my friend.
We've gotta burn the rest of them.
All right, step back.
You sure that's all of them?
We cleaned out the storehouse, the lab.
There is nothing left.
Where's Blair?
I can't find Blair.
Where's everybody else?
Windows is in the radio room still trying to get through.
Everyone else is in the rec room.
Well, you go on. I'll be in in a minute.
Blair?
Blair?
Don't! You son of a bitch.
You understand me?
- He's got a gun. Get back.
- Anybody interferes, I'll kill them.
- Jesus.
- Just leave it here. We're gonna talk.
He smashed up some of the chopper pretty good.
Nobody talk to nobody!
Childs, go see if he got to the tractor.
Nobody gets in and out of here. Nobody.
You guys think I'm crazy. Well, that's fine.
Most of you don't know what's going on around here.
Well, I'm damn well sure some of you do.
Christ.
He got most of the chopper and the tractor, and he's killed the rest of the dogs.
Garry, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Now, Childs, go around to the map room door. Talk to him.
Okay.
Norris, get a table from the lab.
Do you think that thing wanted to be an animal?
No dogs make it a thousand miles through the cold.
Nah, you don't understand!
That thing wanted to be us.
If the cell gets out it could imitate everything on the face of the earth
- and it's not gonna stop!
- Okay, Blair.
Come on, man, you don't wanna hurt anybody.
I'll kill you.
Good shot, MacReady.
- Excuse me.
- Okay.
- All right, bring him up.
- Yeah.
Come on, Blair.
What about your shack?
I don't want him in my shack.
We'll lock him in the toolshed.
- Why am I in here?
- For your own protection, Blair.
How you doing, old boy?
I don't know who to trust.
I know what you mean, Blair.
Trust's a tough thing to come by these days.
Tell you what.
Why don't you just trust in the Lord?
- Watch Clark.
- What?
I said, watch Clark.
And watch him close. Do you hear me?
And now the radio's gone.
- And so are the choppers.
- We're completely cut off.
All we can do now is hole up
'til spring, wait for the rescue team.
No, we don't wait.
Somebody in this camp ain't what he appears to be.
Right now that may be one or two of us.
By spring, it could be all of us.
So how do we know who's human?
If I was an imitation, a perfect imitation, how would you know if it was really me?
Is there some kind of test, Doc?
Well, yeah, possibly.
I've been thinking about a blood serum test.
What's that?
We could take a sample of each person's blood, mix it with uncontaminated blood.
I suppose if there's a reaction, we'd know who isn't human.
- We've got whole blood in storage.
- Start working on it.
Keep an eye on Clark.
He was close to that dog.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Mac, we need Blair's help.
He's the only one who knows this organism.
He's too far gone.
But get the rest of his notebooks.
Start going through them.
Garry! Hey, you guys, come here!
- What?
- Somebody got to the blood.
What?
- Where's Clark?
- Right here.
- Wait a minute. Was this broken into?
- The lock is undamaged.
Somebody opened it, closed it, then locked it.
Great.
Who's got access to it?
I guess I'm the only one.
And I got the only key.
- Would that test have worked, Doc?
- I think so, yes.
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
Well, who else could've used that key?
Nobody! I just give it to Copper whenever he needs it.
Could anybody have gotten it from you, Doc?
I don't see how. As soon as I'm finished,
I return it right away.
Great.
- When was the last time you used it?
- Day or so ago.
I suppose somebody could have lifted it off me...
Oh, come on!
That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.
Accusing everybody...
MacREADY: Stop it! It ain't worth it!
Copper's the only one who's got any business with it.
Wait a minute!
You've been in here on several occasions.
Doc thought of the test.
So what? Is that supposed to clear him?
- Windows!
- Windows!
Put that down!
- No.
- I'll put this right through your head.
You guys gonna listen to Garry?
You gonna let him give the orders?
He could be one of those things.
Windows.
Wait a minute. Just take it easy.
Put the gun down.
Put it down. You don't want to hurt anybody.
Right.
On the floor.
It's on the floor.
I don't know about Copper, but I give you my word,
I did not go near that blood.
But I guess you'll all feel a little easier if somebody else was in charge.
Norris, I can't see anybody objecting to you.
I'm sorry, fellas, but I'm not up to it.
- I'll take it.
- Like hell you will.
It should be somebody a little more even-tempered, Childs.
MacREADY: All right.
MacREADY: I know I'm human.
And if you were all these things, then you'd just attack me right now.
So some of you are still human.
This thing doesn't want to show itself.
It wants to hide inside an imitation.
It'll fight if it has to.
But it's vulnerable out in the open.
If it takes us over, then it has no more enemies, nobody left to kill it.
And then it's won.
There's a storm hitting us in six hours.
We're gonna find out who's who.
All right, Doc, Garry and Clark, move over there away from the others.
Norris, you and Childs shoot them up with morphine.
Tie them down in the rec room and watch them.
Fuchs, you start working on a new technique.
- I need Doc's help.
- You don't wanna drug me.
Mac, I'm not a prisoner!
Let me do it.
You're gonna break the needle in my arm.
No, Doc, he's doing a real fine job.
I'm gonna hide this tape when I'm finished.
If none of us make it, at least there'll be some kind of record.
Storm's been hitting us hard now for 48 hours.
We still have nothing to go on.
One other thing,
I think it rips through your clothes when it takes you over.
Windows found some shredded long johns, but the name tag was missing.
They could be anybody's.
Nobody...
Nobody trusts anybody now.
And we're all very tired.
Nobody trusts anybody now.
There's nothing else I can do.
Just wait.
R.J. MacReady, helicopter pilot,
U.S. Outpost, number 31.
You come up with anything yet?
One or two ideas.
But, MacReady, I've been thinking.
If a small particle of this thing is enough to take over an entire organism, then everyone should prepare their own meals.
And I suggest we only eat out of cans.
All right.
Who's that?
Anybody see Fuchs?
Somebody blew out a fuse in the lab.
Lights were out for an hour.
Anyone of us could've gotten to him.
All right, we gotta find him.
Nauls, why don't you come with me and we'll look outside.
Palmer, you and Windows check the inside.
I ain't going with Windows.
I ain't going with him. I'll go with Childs.
- Hey, fuck you, Palmer!
- I ain't going with you!
- Who says I want you going with me?
- Cut the bullshit!
Windows, you come with us.
Norris, you stay here.
Any of them move, you fry them.
You hear anything, cut loose on the sirens.
We all meet back here in 20 minutes regardless.
And everybody watch whoever you're with... real close.
Hey, Blair.
Blair, have you seen Fuchs?
I don't wanna stay out here anymore.
I wanna come back inside.
I hear funny things out here.
- Have you come across Fuchs?
- It ain't Fuchs.
It ain't Fuchs.
I'm not gonna harm anybody.
There's nothing wrong with me.
And if there was, I'm all better now.
I'd like to come back inside.
Now you've got my promise.
We'll see.
Wait a minute, man.
I wanna come back inside, don't you understand?
I'm all right.
I'm much better... and I won't harm anybody.
You gotta let me come back inside.
Hold it!
Is it Fuchs?
Yeah.
Why would it burn him?
Flare. Maybe he tried to burn it.
Maybe he burned himself before it could get to him.
Great! Now what are we gonna do?
You go inside.
Tell the others we found Fuchs.
We'll be in as soon as we can.
- Where are we going?
- Up to my shack.
What the hell for?
'Cause when I left yesterday,
I turned the lights off.
How long have they been out there?
Forty, 45 minutes.
We better start closing off the outside doors.
Hey! All of you, come here!
Open up! Open up this door! Open up! Open up!
Close that door.
Where's MacReady?
I cut him loose of the line up by his shack.
- Cut him loose?
- Yeah.
We were up checking around his place,
I found this.
Look. It was stashed in his oil furnace.
Wind must've dislodged it, but I don't think he saw me find it.
I made sure I got ahead of him on the towline on the way back.
I cut him loose.
- MacReady?
- He's one of them.
- When do you think it got to him?
- I don't know.
It could've been anytime, anywhere.
If it did get to him.
Look, Childs, come on.
- When the lights went out.
- That would've been perfect.
Right. You said guys were missing.
Windows, where were you?
I told you to shut your mouth!
This is just what it wants!
To pit us against each other.
- Let's open it.
- Hell no!
You think he's changed into one of those things?
He's had time.
Nothing human could've made it back here in this weather without a guide line.
- Let's open it now.
- Why are you so anxious to let him in here?
Because it's so close.
- May be our best chance to blow it away.
- Let him freeze.
Childs, what if we're wrong about him?
Well, then, we're wrong!
The supply window!
All right, all right, we got no choice now!
Damn it! He's got the keys!
What's going on? The towline snapped.
Bullshit, Childs.
He's got to know damn well I cut it!
You're a dead man, MacReady!
Or a dead whatever the hell you are!
Anyone messes with me and the whole camp goes.
Come on, Childs, burn me.
Put those torches on the floor and back off.
Back off. Way off.
- You asshole.
- You'd have done the same thing.
Don't argue with him.
Where's the rest?
Come on, man, I mean it!
It's cool, MacReady, come on.
Yeah. Yeah, man, just relax.
Anybody touches me... and we go.
- He's not breathing!
- Go untie the doc.
Get him in here. And bring the others.
From now on, nobody gets out of my sight.
Let me at him.
So, you sweethearts were about to have a little lynching party, huh?
I might just have to put an end to you on general principles, Nauls.
Did it ever occur to the jury that anybody could've gotten some of my clothes
- and stuck them up the furnace?
- We ain't buying that.
Quit that bickering over there!
Windows, wheel that defibrillator over here.
Give me those paddles!
You're gonna have to sleep sometime, MacReady.
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs.
If anyone tries to wake me...
Clear!
- Clear!
- Clear.
- We're on fire, MacReady! We're on fire!
- Get back! Just wait!
All right, go!
Windows! Windows, get in here!
You gotta be fucking kidding.
- What do you got in mind, MacReady?
- A little test.
And, Windows, you and Palmer, tie everybody down real tight.
- What for?
- For your health.
Let's rush him!
He's not gonna blow us all up!
No, no, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Let's do what Mac says.
I mean, he wasted Norris pretty quick, didn't he?
That's close enough, Clark.
He ain't tying me up.
Then I'll have to kill you, Childs.
Then kill me.
I mean it.
I guess you do.
Geez. This is bullshit, Mac!
- Finish it, Palmer.
- They're dead, Mac!
- Windows?
- Yo?
You tie up Palmer over here.
We're gonna draw a little bit of everybody's blood
'cause we're gonna find out who's the thing.
Watching Norris in there gave me the idea that maybe every part of him was a whole.
Every little piece was an individual animal with a built-in desire to protect its own life.
You see, when a man bleeds, it's just tissue.
The blood from one of you things won't obey when it's attacked.
It'll try and survive.
Crawl away from a hot needle the same.
Now you.
That's good.
All right, move back, over there.
I guess you're okay.
All right. Put that on and watch them.
Now I'll show you what I already know.
It's a crock of shit.
Let's try the doc and Clark.
Now Clark.
Then Clark was human, huh?
Which makes you a murderer, don't it?
Palmer now.
This is pure nonsense.
It doesn't prove a thing.
I thought you'd feel that way, Garry.
You were the only one that could've got to that blood.
We'll do you last.
Get him away from me! MacReady, burn it!
What is it?
Come on!
Get me out of here!
Windows, blast him!
Get me out of here! Get me out of here!
Windows!
Get me out of here!
MacReady, get in here! Come on, hurry up!
He's coming back! Burn it!
Burn it, for God's sake!
Hurry up, MacReady! Burn it!
Let's do it.
Get me out of here! Cut me loose!
Cut me the hell... Come on, get me out of here! Come on, get me out of here!
Cut me loose, damn it!
I know you gentlemen have been through a lot, but when you find the time,
I'd rather not spend the rest of this winter tied to this fucking couch!
Childs.
We're going out to give Blair the test.
If he tries to make it back here and we're not with him... burn him.
Mac, the door's open!
How'd he get out?
The door was bolted from the outside.
Blair?
Hey, Blair, you down there?
We got something for ya!
Blair's been busy out here all by himself.
What is it?
Something he's been making.
It's a ship of some kind.
He stole the parts from the helicopter.
The smart S.O.B. put it together piece by piece.
Where was he trying to go?
Anyplace but here.
Hey, you guys, come here. Come here.
I think I saw Childs outside the main entrance of the camp.
- What's he doing outside?
- I don't know.
Got a flare?
He got back inside and blew the generator.
In six hours, it'll be a hundred below in here.
Well, that's suicide!
Not for that thing. It wants to freeze now.
It's got no way out of here.
It just wants to go to sleep in the cold until the rescue team finds it.
What can we do? What can we do?
Whether we make it or not, we can't let that thing freeze again.
Maybe we'll just warm things up a little around here.
We're not getting out of here alive.
But neither is that thing.
Generator room.
The generator's gone.
Any way we can fix it?
It's gone, MacReady.
All right.
We gotta bring this whole place right down into the ice.
Garry, plant yours in the old storage room.
Nauls, down by the generator.
God!
How's it coming in there?
I said, how's it...
Yeah, fuck you, too!
You the only one who made it?
Not the only one.
Did you kill it?
Where were you, Childs?
Thought I saw Blair.
I went out after him and got lost in the storm.
Fire's got the temperature up all over the camp.
Won't last long, though.
Neither will we.
How will we make it?
Maybe we shouldn't.
If you're worried about me...
If we've got any surprises for each other,
I don't think we're in much shape to do anything about it.
Well... what do we do?
Why don't we just... wait here for a little while?
See what happens.
Oh! No!
No, no!
Mother! Oh, God, Mother!
Blood! Blood!
Are you stating, Counsel,
you're not gonna offer any contradictory psychiatric testimony?
Yes, Your Honor.
On the basis of this staff report,
Norman Bates is judged restored to sanity and is ordered released forthwith.
What about his victims?
Don't they have any say?
Can you restore them?
Madam, please sit down.
This matter is being represented by the District Attorney.
Your Honor, my name is Mrs. Lila Loomis.
I have a petition here signed by 743 people against Norman Bates' release, including the relatives of the seven people he murdered.
Doesn't that give me the right to speak out?
Has the District Attorney advised Mrs. Loomis about her rights in this matter?
Yes, Your Honor.
I explained that her petition had no effect on these proceedings.
Did you explain to her that this hearing...
Why are you people just sitting here?
Don't you realize they're going to release a homicidal maniac?
I must ask you to sit down or I'll have the bailiff remove you from this courtroom.
If you've any further questions, please discuss them with the District Attorney after this hearing.
Why bother?
It's all too obvious, our courts protect the criminals, not their victims.
Congratulations, Norman.
Turning now to calendar number 71143.
Is that all there is to it?
That's all there is to it. Let's go.
Let the record reflect that the defendant is present with counsel.
Just like I said, they let him go.
I'll call you later.
Are you satisfied,
Doctor?
Turning a murderer loose on an innocent public?
Mrs. Loomis, Norman was not convicted of murder.
He was found "not guilty" by reason of insanity.
And since he is no longer...
That is just legal hocus-pocus and when he murders again, you will be directly responsible.
Well, this belongs to Mr. Toomey who runs the motel.
Want me to find him?
I'll introduce you.
No, no. It'll... lt'll wait.
What's the matter?
Uh, I saw someone.
Where?
L-ln that window.
They haven't had a tenant in the house for years.
I guess
I'm just nervous.
Well, that's understandable under the circumstances.
Yeah.
Well, this is it.
Yeah.
You don't have to stay here, you know.
I could find you a place in town.
No, no.
L... I want to stay here.
Then as long as you realize that the memories are more likely to reoccur here...
But you know how to handle that now, don't you?
Sure.
You start work at noon today.
Don't forget.
No, I won't.
I don't suppose you will.
What's wrong?
Oh, nothing, really.
I just wish there hadn't been all those cutbacks, there'd be a trained social worker looking in on you from time to time.
Well, I have you, don't I?
Damn right you do.
I had the phone reconnected.
Any trouble, use it.
Okay.
Thanks, Doctor, for everything.
Mother?
Norman.
Norman, what did you put in my tea?
I'm gonna get you for this, Norman.
I'm gonna show you what happens
to bad little boys who poison their mothers.
I'm going to kill you!
Can I help you?
I'm Norman. Norman Bates.
The new cook's helper.
Oh, yes.
Doctor what's-his-name called about you.
Raymond.
I'm the one who urged Mr. Statler to give you the job.
I think it's very Christian to forgive and forget, don't you?
I sure do.
So do I. Myrna.
This is Norman Bates.
That's Myrna, Norman.
Come on, I'll introduce you to Mr. Statler.
He's in the back.
Ralph, this is Norman Bates.
You have to tell me what.
Just give me...
Ralph, this is Norman Bates, your new helper.
Hi. Get him an apron, will you, Mrs. Spool?
Scott, we have to talk about it sometime.
Step on it, would you, girl?
You're being paid to wait on tables, not gab on the phone.
Look, I'll call you back later. We'll talk then.
We're getting ready for rush hour.
He's really very nice once he catches his breath.
Hey, Queen for a Day, wanna try being a waitress?
Mary, this is Norman.
He's gonna be working back here.
Hi.
Boyfriend troubles, poor child.
Heart of gold but head of wood.
Let's get that apron for you, shall we?
Here you go.
Jesus Christ, girl, what have you broken this time?
It wasn't her fault,
Mr. Statler.
It was me.
L... l... I did it.
Well, let her pick up and you get back here before you do any more damage.
Thanks.
Here, Bates.
Here, put these up there under the hot lights and read the orders off.
On the wheel. On the wheel.
Oh.
Uh, two meatloaf sandwiches and one mashed potato with gravy.
And one baked potato.
Okay, go ahead, go ahead, do it. See if I care.
No, no, Scott. I didn't mean it. Listen to me.
Hello?
Hello?
Bastard.
You all right?
Of course I'm all right.
Where you going?
Into town.
Will you please leave me alone?
If you're going into town, you're heading in the wrong direction.
Look, l... I don't know what happened, but, uh, why don't you let me call you a cab?
Why?
Why? So you can get home safely.
I don't have a home.
No home?
I've been living with my boyfriend for over a year.
And all of a sudden, he tells me we're through.
And then I just phoned him to ask him why and he wouldn't tell me.
All he'd say is that I couldn't come back to our apartment.
Well, what're you...
What... What're you gonna do?
Call a friend in town,
I guess.
See if somebody'll let me crash with them for the night.
What about your parents?
Uh, couldn't you stay with them?
They're in Portland.
And they don't care what happens to me, anyway.
Oh, uh, I own a motel not too far from here.
And you'd be welcome to spend the night in one of the empty rooms if you'd like.
F-FOC, of course.
What?
Free of charge.
Oh.
But no, that's very nice of you but I don't wanna impose.
You wouldn't be imposing.
Co-workers ought to help each other out, don't you think?
You know what, you covered for me today when I broke that pie plate.
Yeah.
I figured you'd get into more trouble for it than I would.
You're not kidding.
I've been working there four days and
I've broken a dozen dishes already.
You sure it's all right if I stay at your motel?
Absolutely.
Come on, let's get going.
It looks like rain.
Well, we almost made it.
You didn't get too wet, did you?
No, I'm all right.
Oh.
Do you own all this?
Oh, yeah.
Well, it isn't much, but I'll get it fixed up eventually.
Well, let me get you a room key.
Mr. Toomey.
Why don't you wait here while I check the room?
Uh, just to make sure the linen's fresh.
What you thinking about stealing something?
There's no reason to be scared, sweetheart. I manage this dump.
What do you want, a room?
Norman's already getting me one, thank you.
You're with Bates?
Well, uh, you must be
Norman Bates.
I'm Warren Toomey.
Mary, why don't you go up to the house?
The... The front door is open.
Is something wrong with the room?
No. Just... Just... Just... Just...
Just go up and wait for me, okay?
Look, it doesn't matter...
Look, just do as I say, okay?
She's pretty cute.
Where'd you find her?
What's this stuff?
I'd say it was drugs.
What about the occupied cabins?
Is that what's going on in there, too?
Yeah.
Boy, this town.
If it isn't the parents, it's the kids.
I caught a couple of them screwin' in the basement of your house up there last week.
Of course,
I threw them right out.
Can you believe that?
What kind of a motel are you running here?
The kind that makes money.
People come here to party.
They stay a few hours and then they leave.
What more can you ask from a motel so far from the beaten track, huh?
You're fired.
Hey, you can't fire me.
I was hired by the hospital.
This State has no claim on me or my property anymore.
And neither do you.
I want you out of here tomorrow.
Yeah, well, why don't you try putting me out, Mr. Whacko, hmm?
I'd like to see that.
I won't have to.
I'll just go to the police.
I'm sure they'd be very interested in what's going on here, especially the drugs.
Tomorrow, Mr. Toomey.
And don't rent out any more rooms in this motel. No more.
At least my customers have a good time.
What'd yours get,
Bates, huh?
Dead, that's what they got!
Dead! Murdered by you, you loony!
Hi!
What was all the yelling about?
Oh.
My motel manager and I just had a fight.
Wasn't because of me, was it?
No.
Why are you sitting in the dark?
I was just thinking about Scott.
Maybe if I hadn't blown up at him so quick, we would've worked things out.
Yeah, maybe.
L... I don't know.
Is that, uh, better?
Do you think I should call him and talk to him again?
Oh, sure.
Hi, Scott?
Are you all right?
What were you talking about?
Listen, I didn't mean it.
Are you still mad at me?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm at this motel.
No, I didn't get wet.
I got here just before the storm started.
Look, I can take care of myself.
No, of course not.
Look, I can't talk any longer.
I got to go.
Uh, oh.
How did it go?
Terrible. I found out why he didn't want me to come home tonight.
Oh, well, why?
He's got somebody new.
He's moved her in already.
Well, that's no good.
Oh, well.
Think how it would've been if
I'd married him and then found out what sort of guy he was.
He asked me to, you know?
Sure. L... I mean,
I'm sure he did.
Oh, uh, have... have... have you had dinner yet?
No.
Well, let... let's have it together.
I was just about to sit down.
It's just, uh, sandwiches and milk, but you're more than welcome to share it.
I really don't think that...
No, no, no, do it. Do it... Do it for my sake. Starving yourself isn't going to make anything any better, either.
All right.
But this is yours.
No, go ahead, you... you have it. I'll make another.
Do you have a knife?
No, I'm afraid I don't.
L... I just moved back here after being many years away.
I forgot to bring any cu-cutlery.
That's odd.
People usually leave something, even if it is only an old butter knife.
Oh, there.
Is something wrong, Norman?
Um, aren't you going to eat?
No. L... l... l... I just suddenly lost my appetite, but you... you... you go ahead.
Enjoy it.
I guess I'm like you. L... I suddenly lost my appetite, too.
Oh, w-w-would you like something else?
There're cookies for dessert.
Oh, no, no, th-thank you.
Uh, can I use your phone again?
Sure.
Who you gonna call?
Um, I just remembered this girlfriend I have in town.
L... I mean, she's kind of a girlfriend, and, uh, maybe she'd let me spend the night with her.
Well, huh, I thought you were gonna stay here.
There's a spare room upstairs and you're more than welcome to it.
Uh, l... I don't think that's such a good idea.
Why?
I don't mean to hurt your feelings or anything, but Myrna was talking about you at the diner today.
Mrs. Spool kept on telling her to shush but she wouldn't.
She said you'd been locked up.
Did she say why?
Well, I'll tell you.
When I was 12, my mother went mad, so I put some poison in her tea.
You know? Just...
I'm all right now.
You sure?
Sure.
Otherwise they wouldn't have given me a job in a diner, would they?
I don't know.
It takes a nut to work there.
Oh, boy!
Look, I-I-I'm sorry, but I don't want to...
What if I told you that I needed you to stay?
Why would you need me?
Because this is the first night
I've spent in this house in years, much less alone.
A lot of my troubles had to do with this house.
So you see, I'm as scared as you are, just for different reasons.
I-I'm sorry, but l... l...
Please.
That bad, huh?
No. Not... Not... Not that one.
This one over there.
What's wrong with this one?
Well, that, uh, used to belong to my mother.
But she's dead, isn't she?
Yeah.
Is this the room where you had your troubles?
One of them, yeah.
Well, I don't know what happened to you in the past, but you're never gonna get over it, not unless you face it.
See? No ghosts.
No.
I could sleep here.
No, I'd, uh...
Why not?
I'd just rather you didn't.
What happened in here that scared you so?
Let me show you the room across the hall, okay?
You'll be, uh, just fine in here.
Well, the, uh...
The bathroom?
L-ls, uh, right over there.
Uh, well,
I guess it's time to, uh, to go to sleep.
Okay.
Good night, Mary.
About time, girl.
Sorry.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm sorry I missed you this morning.
I got up early and went into town to see my girlfriend.
You know, the one
I was telling you about.
Guess what?
What?
We're going to room together.
Well, y-y-y-you... you're more than welcome to stay with me, you know.
Thanks, but I'd really rather live in town.
Oh, in town, yeah.
Uh, my... my place is a lot closer to work.
No, l... I really don't think that's a good idea.
Okay. Well, if you change your mind.
Hey, girl, I gave you the morning off, not the afternoon.
Hop to it.
Charming, isn't he?
Chop up some more lettuce, will you, Norman?
Hey, Ralph, so, uh, how's your new helper doing?
Hi, Warren.
Just fine, thanks.
Yeah, well, I hope he washes dishes better than he runs a motel.
Hey, can I get a little service around here or what, huh?
Okay.
Hey, cutie! Come here.
Oh, hello, what would you like?
I'd like some of what
Norman got last night.
Pardon?
You heard me, sweetheart.
Why don't you look at a menu and I'll be right back?
What happened between you and that man last night?
I fired him.
Oh, great, he's on my station.
What did he say?
Nothing nice and I think he's been drinking.
He sure smells like it.
Hey, you do have other tables, honey, or do you want me to wait on those, too?
Talk about the customers being nasty.
Excuse me, do you still work here?
Yeah.
Then can I please have my orders?
What was it like?
What's what like?
Screwin' a psycho?
Would you mind removing your foot?
Next.
Two turkey sandwiches on whole wheat toast.
One BLT, hold the mayo.
I'll get the tomatoes,
Mr. Statler.
Hey, I suppose you didn't spend last night alone with him in that house, huh?
You got strange tastes in men, honey.
Just because two people sleep under the same roof doesn't necessarily mean they've made love.
Since when, huh?
Or are you the kind that doesn't, uh, kiss and tell?
You really want to know what Norman's like?
Yeah.
Better than you'll ever be, fat boy.
Cut it out, Toomey!
Norman?
Are you talkin' to me, whacko?
Come on.
Come on. Come on! Huh?
What's wrong?
Oh. Oh, that's... that's beautiful.
Go on, psycho, pick it up.
Come on, pick it up!
What's the matter, you lose your nerve, huh?
Or do you only attack women, huh?
Go on, pick it up!
Show us what you're really like.
Come... Come on, loony.
Oh, look, not only is he crazy, he's chicken shit, too.
What's the trouble, Warren?
The trouble is that psycho you hired.
This is the last time
I eat here.
You're sweating all over.
Can I get you something?
A glass of water, maybe?
No.
What the hell did you do out there?
That man, Mr. Toomey, he was trying...
I'm not talkin' to you, girl.
Well?
He was bothering Mary, and then he slipped me a note.
What note?
It's there on the wheel.
There's nothing here.
Look, Norman, you're tired.
Why don't you take the rest of the afternoon off?
I'm telling you, it was right there.
Sure it was.
Don't humor me.
I'm telling you there was a note on that wheel from my dead mother.
Okay, everybody, business as usual.
Hi.
Is that offer to room with you still open?
Oh, sure.
Great.
Well, w-what happened?
Oh, you know my girlfriend, the one I told you about?
Yeah.
Well, her boyfriend sleeps over almost every night.
Do you know what it's like trying to sleep in a one-room apartment when a couple's making love five feet from you?
Noisy?
You're not kidding.
Well, I thought you were wonderful today.
Why?
The way you handled that Toomey guy.
What an asshole.
I could've killed him and you were so cool.
No, I don't kill people anymore, remember?
Oh, here.
What's this?
Fudge.
My grandmother sent it to me. She makes great fudge.
Well, thank you.
What about that note?
You figure out who sent it?
That was just a practical joke.
Yeah, I guess so.
Oh, oh, oh, l-let me take that.
No, no, no, that's all right. I can manage.
Uh...
Did you... Did you have dinner yet?
Yes.
And I'm exhausted. I'm going to bed right after I take a shower.
If that's all right with you.
Oh, oh, sure.
Hey, wake up!
Hey, you nut guys there?
Hey!
Psycho!
Hey, hello, psycho!
I just want you to know
I'm moving out! Huh?
Hello?
W-What? Who is this?
My mother is dead.
Mr. Toomey, if this is you, you're sicker than I ever was.
Bastard.
Bill!
Hi, Bill. I wasn't expecting you till tomorrow.
Hi, Norman.
I got a call from Mr. Statler.
He said you quit your job at the diner.
Yeah. Well, I just figured I could make more money with the motel.
You know, once I get... once I get it back into condition that is.
What does Mr. Toomey think about your plans?
Him? You know,
I fired him.
Y-Y-You know, he was turning this place into what I think they call an "adult motel."
Oh, I see.
Well, there've been an awful lot of changes in the week you've been back.
Yeah, yeah.
Any more notes or phone calls?
Oh, no, no, no.
Who's that?
Where?
There, in the top window?
In the attic?
It looked like a woman.
Oh, oh, oh, that must've been Mary.
Mary, who?
Oh, Mary. She works with me at the diner.
She's been staying here, too.
Hmm?
Oh, it's nothing like that.
We're just, uh, we're just friends.
Mary.
Hi, Mary. You look great.
Look, this is, uh, this is Dr. Raymond.
He was my psychiatrist in the institution.
Hello.
Hi.
Well, what do you think?
About what?
What Norman's doing. Has he told you his plans for the place?
Some of them.
Well, I have to be going to work.
Can I give you a lift?
Go ahead.
See you tonight.
So, what can I do for you, Doctor?
Oh, thank you.
Are you familiar with the Norman Bates case?
Very. I was deputy here when Sheriff Chambers arrested him years ago.
I re-read the file when I found out he'd been released.
So, what's the trouble?
Bates dressing up as his mother again?
No, nothing like that.
Although, Norman says that somebody has been leaving notes and making phone calls claiming to be his mother.
Well, people. So, what do you want me to do about it?
Put a tap on his phone.
Sorry, Doc,
I can't do that.
This is Fairvale, California, not Washington, DC.
But I can check around and see who might hate Norman enough to do something like that.
Anything else?
You could keep an eye on Norman.
I have been.
All right, Sheriff, here's my card, in case you should need me.
Oh, there is one other thing.
Why, of course, what?
He's got a girl living with him.
Uh, Mary Samuels.
She works at the diner.
Then I'll check on her, too.
Thank you, Sheriff.
Any time.
Slut?
Are you sure this is safe?
It always has been.
Come on.
Oh, I don't need any more.
What's that?
What?
That sound in the next room.
You're just stoned.
I'm not.
Jesus.
What is it?
Shh.
Let's get out of here.
Shh.
Come on, hurry!
Come on!
Look out, behind you!
Norman?
Norman?
Norman?
Mary, up here.
What are you doing up here?
L... I was locked in.
You couldn't have been.
There's no key in the lock.
Someone unlocked it while I was asleep.
Who?
Whoever's been pretending to be my mother.
Norman, what are you talking about?
I saw her in the window.
And just look in the room.
It's all been fixed up and her stuff's inside.
There's another note, too.
I'm going to check the back stairs, maybe they went down that way.
Norman?
What?
There's no note in there.
What do you mean it's not there?
No, th-this isn't how it was.
It was all fixed up.
It wasn't like this.
The... The note.
This...
The dresses are...
Who's that?
Norman, you better answer the door.
Yeah.
Norman, whatever you do, don't tell them about the bedroom.
Hello, Norman,
Well?
I'm Sheriff Hunt.
How are you?
This is Deputy Pool.
Can we come in?
Sure, yes. Yes.
Uh, this is...
I know. Mary Samuels.
What can we do for you?
There hasn't been any trouble, has there?
Yes, there has.
What sort?
The old sort.
There's a girl sitting down in my squad car below.
Too scared to come into this house.
Why?
She claims that she saw her boyfriend murdered in your fruit cellar today by a large woman dressed in black.
That's just how your mother used to look, isn't it, Norman?
Well, what... what were they doing in the cellar, anyway?
Oh, what kids do today,
I guess.
Smoking dope, messin' around.
Do you know anything about that, Norman?
No.
Do you mind if we look in the fruit cellar?
No.
Looks clean to me.
Yeah, doesn't it?
You've been straightening up down here?
No, sir.
This is the first time
I've been inside this room s-s-since I came home.
Then who did it?
I did.
Several days ago.
Hey, Norman?
I just hate a dirty house, don't you?
Why is this open?
I don't know.
You better put a padlock on it before someone robs you blind.
You know why Norman doesn't come down here, don't you?
No, I don't.
He used to keep his mother's corpse down here.
Stole it from the grave.
Talked to himself in her voice, answering in his own.
What do you think of that?
It's horrible.
That's right, it was.
Now, let me ask you again.
Are you positive you cleaned up down here?
Yes.
All right.
Mike?
Yeah?
Let's go.
Are you sure that neither one of you heard anything this afternoon between 4:00 and 5:00?
I don't know.
But I was...
He was with me all afternoon.
We were walking in the fields.
Goodbye.
Nice to see you again,
Norman.
Why did you do that?
Do what?
Lie to the Sheriff?
You weren't with me this afternoon.
I had to do something.
He was going to arrest you.
Norman.
It's starting again.
Sheriff Hunt?
Yes.
I-I'm Lila Loomis.
I used to be Lila Crane.
Oh, yes, of course.
What a coincidence.
I was just thinkin' about you and Sam.
How is he?
My husband is dead.
I'm sorry.
Well, what brings you back to Fairvale after all these years?
Norman Bates.
Where is he?
He's out at his motel,
I suppose.
Why haven't you arrested him?
What for?
For murder.
It's all over town what he did to that boy.
Mrs. Loomis, I can't arrest a man without proof.
Especially one with an alibi.
What alibi?
There's a girl staying out there with him and she says that he was with her at the time the murder took place if there was a murder.
Oh, well, what do you mean
"if there was a murder"?
Well, what I mean is that I am not convinced that anybody was killed.
There's no body.
No corpus delicti.
So let's just wait and see if the boy comes home tonight.
Have you dragged the swamp yet?
What?
The swamp?
That's where he dumped his victims the last time.
Have you dragged it yet?
No, ma'am.
Well, then I suggest you start, before there are more murders.
Unless, of course, you want it on your conscience.
What's her problem?
I don't know.
But if Norman Bates is crazy, there are a whole lot of people around here runnin' him a close second.
Are you sure you're all right?
Yeah. I'm fine.
What you need is one of my special Irish coffees.
Is there any brandy in the house?
I don't know.
My mother doesn't allow liquor.
Mr. Toomey was a drinker, wasn't he?
Did he leave a bottle in the office?
I don't know.
I didn't look.
I'll be right back.
You rest here.
Hello?
Why did you lie to the Sheriff and say Bates was with you this afternoon?
Mother. What are you doing here?
Go back to the hotel before you ruin everything.
Answer my question?
Why did you alibi Bates?
I didn't alibi him.
Don't lie to me.
I talked to the Sheriff.
Why did you do it?
Because Norman couldn't have murdered that boy.
Why not?
He saw me in the window like we planned, then he went in to the room and saw the stuff.
Then when he went looking for her,
I locked the attic door behind him.
He was trapped in there for hours while I took everything down the back stairs.
So, you see, he couldn't have done it.
What difference does it make?
We want him re-committed.
This would have done it.
Mother, he's innocent.
Innocent? He killed your aunt, didn't he?
Not to mention the six other people.
Mother, that was 22 years ago.
Mary, people don't change.
He must have gotten out somehow.
Mother, I was wrong.
I don't think he drilled that hole in the bathroom wall.
Of course he did.
Mother, listen to me.
I think there's someone else in the house.
Don't be stupid.
It's just Bates up to his old tricks again.
It can't be Norman.
He isn't like that anymore.
Maybe if you knew him now.
It's just that he's trying so very hard to do what's right to keep his sanity.
And that hardly seems fair for us to be doing what we're doing to him.
You're as crazy as he is.
We'll talk later.
Norman needs me.
Norman needs you?
A psychopath needs you?
Look, go back to your hotel.
We'll talk later.
He'll kill you.
You know that, don't you?
He'll murder you just like he did all the others.
Mary!
My God, what happened?
I don't know.
Jesus. How did that get in there?
After I killed that kid in the cellar,
I used it to clean up the mess and then, then I flushed it down there.
You didn't kill anybody.
You were locked in the attic.
It wasn't locked.
You said so yourself.
Norman, stop talking nonsense.
I told you, you didn't kill anybody.
Then how do you explain this?
Well?
I can't.
Did you clean up the cellar the way you told the Sheriff?
No.
Somebody did.
And with that towel, after they killed that kid.
Norman, it couldn't have been you.
How can you be so sure?
Even I don't know.
I always used black out when l...
Because you couldn't.
You don't have it in you, not anymore.
Norman, look, why don't you go downstairs and make us a drink, okay?
And I'll clean this up.
Norman.
Yes.
Uh, the tea kettle's boiling.
Oh.
Okay.
What happened?
Up there.
I saw someone staring at me.
There's no one there now.
Someone was watching me through that hole.
They're in the house right now.
Where'd you get that thing?
L... I had it in my purse.
My mother gave it me when I was...
Oh.
Come on.
Uh...
You take the downstairs,
I'll check up here.
Well, shouldn't we stick together?
Don't worry,
I've got this.
It's because of me, isn't it?
That's why you have it.
Of course not.
Hurry up, they'll get away.
Mrs. Lila Loomis,
Room 15, please.
You're sure she hasn't come back?
There'll be no message, thank you.
Okay, Mother, where are you?
Norman.
What is it?
It's my mother.
She's downstairs.
Did you see her?
You're sure you heard her?
Come on.
No.
She'll kill you.
I know she will.
Norman, your mother's dead.
You killed her.
You told me so yourself.
I was wrong.
She survived.
And now, she's downstairs, waiting for you.
Norman, it couldn't be your mother.
No.
No, it... it had to be someone else.
Whoever it is that's trying to drive you crazy again.
Yeah?
Yes.
So, let's go downstairs and find...
No!
It's too dangerous.
Let's wait till morning.
What are we gonna do until then?
I'll protect you.
You'll be okay.
I'll... I'll be fine right here.
It was always safe here at night.
Norman, listen...
No!
Okay.
We'll spend the night in here.
You can use the sleeping bag.
What are you doing, Norman?
Norman, put the knife down.
Nobody's gonna come in the door.
They're not?
No.
Okay.
Mary.
Yes.
I'm becoming confused again, aren't I?
Of course not.
Don't lie to me. Not you.
Yes, Norman, you are becoming confused again.
Just don't let them take me back to the institution, all right?
Don't worry, Norman.
I won't.
You smell good.
I do?
Yeah.
What do I smell like?
You smell like, like the toasted cheese sandwiches...
What?
...that my mother used to bring me when I was in bed with a temperature.
She used to do lots of nice things for me before she went...
Before she became...
Shh.
Just remember the good things she did for you.
Only the good things.
I can't.
They're not there anymore.
Of course they're there.
No, the doctors took them all away.
Along with everything else.
Except, except those sandwiches.
Shh.
Just sleep.
Oh, good morning, Doctor.
Good morning, Norman.
I called your office.
They said you were on your way over here.
Where's Mary?
She's gone in to town.
Oh. What for?
I don't know.
She didn't tell me.
Some tea?
Coffee, if you have it.
Thank you.
Sure.
Norman.
Do you remember
Lila Loomis?
Yes.
She's staying in town.
She is?
She's Mary's mother.
That's why Mary went in to town. To see her.
Do you realize what this means, Norman?
What?
They're the ones who've been leaving the notes and making the phone calls.
Why would they do that?
Because they hate you.
Mary, Mary doesn't hate me.
Come on, Norman.
Like mother like daughter.
You know how Lila Loomis feels about you.
She can't wait see you re-institutionalized.
That's why all this is happening to you.
They want to destabilize you, undermine your sense of reality.
They can't do that.
Good. Glad to hear you say that.
But...
It isn't them, anyway.
It isn't?
Who is it?
It's my mother.
She's not dead.
How do you know that?
I've seen her, up in the window.
You saw her, too.
That was Mary Loomis or Lila Loomis dressed up to look like your mother.
What about the phone calls?
Mary Loomis again.
But she's been with me when the phone rang.
Then it was her mother.
My mother spoke to me.
Downstairs.
Norman.
Do you remember now our discussions about your mother?
Once you accepted the fact that you murdered her, her memory would have no hold over you.
Room 15, please.
I want you to stop calling Norman.
What are you doing here?
You heard me.
Stop calling Norman.
I haven't called him.
Don't lie to me.
You called him this morning.
For God's sake, keep your voice down.
All right, so what if I did call him?
He's slipping into insanity again,
I can hear it in his voice.
There's nothing anyone can do about it, not even you.
You could stop stuffing bloody towels down toilets and peering through peepholes in walls.
That would be a help.
What?
What are you talking about?
About what you're doing to Norman.
You were in that house last night.
I was not.
I came right back here after I saw you.
Don't lie to me.
I'm not lying.
Why weren't you in your room last night when I called?
What, did you have me paged?
I was probably down here.
Mother, stop lying to me, please.
What happened in that house last night?
Goodbye, Mother.
He's about to go over the edge, isn't he?
Listen. Now listen.
Just dress up in his mother's clothes one more time.
That's all it's going to take.
I'll have the police and the doctor before you are in danger.
Then they'll have to act on our petition.
Mother, I signed all your petitions.
I've been to all your meetings, done everything you've asked for years.
But I am not going to hurt Norman anymore.
Well, if you won't do it for me, at least do it for your father.
I'm not living for dead people anymore, Mother.
Not for your sister, or my father, not even for you.
I'm going.
Now, wait a minute.
Mother, let go, you're hurting me.
Mom, don't.
No.
Listen to me! If you go near that house, you're going to be sorry.
Yeah.
I don't see what all the rush is for.
The Sheriff's concerned.
And he thought we might bend the rules.
I don't like it.
You're supposed to have an order from the coroner.
Now do you believe me?
Yes. She's dead.
Then she's not coming back to life again, is she?
Back to life?
No.
Shall we go?
Mary.
Back here.
I was just about to have some lunch.
You want some?
No.
Where have you been?
At the cemetery.
Dr. Raymond had them open up my mother's coffin.
Oh.
Yes.
That proves that she's not the one who's been torturing me.
Not unless she's a ghost.
No.
No. He says, he says it's you and your mother.
He says your last name is Loomis.
Is that true, Mary?
I wonder who that could be.
I don't know.
Don't you?
Hello, Mrs. Loomis?
How are you this...
I'm... I'm sorry, Mother.
I didn't mean to insult you.
Norman, stop it.
This is not your mother.
Hello. Hello, Lila?
Lila, are you there?
There's no one on the line.
Hello?
Yes, Mother, I'm sorry we were interrupted.
Norman, there's no one there.
Yes, Mother.
Yes, Mother.
Hello?
Hello, Norman?
This is your mother.
It doesn't sound like her.
It is, Norman, and I want you to hang up.
Do you understand? Hang up.
All right.
Do it, Norman, now.
Hang up.
I was so worried.
About what?
Well, that all the things that have been happening to me were because of you and your mother.
When Dr. Raymond showed me
Mrs. Bates' corpse,
I knew she was dead for sure.
But now, now I know it's somebody completely different.
Who is it?
My real mother.
Who is your real mother,
Norman?
I don't know.
She won't tell me.
Your mother is dead.
Mrs. Bates was your real mother and she's dead.
Then who was that on the phone?
My mother.
Dr. Raymond was right about both of us.
Lila and I were trying to drive you crazy again.
But then I stopped, only she won't, and she's the one who's calling.
Well, why did you stop?
It wasn't fair for us to be doing what we were doing to you.
Is that the only reason?
What do you mean?
You know what I mean.
Ma'am?
Norman?
The Sheriff would like to see you out at the swamp.
Hey, Sam.
Yeah?
Scotch it is.
There you go.
All right.
Spread that line away.
We're gonna send the divers down here in a minute.
Hello, Norman.
Hi, Sheriff.
What is... What is going on here?
Have you seen this before?
No. Did you... Did you find it in the swamp?
Yes.
How about any of this stuff?
This is Mr. Toomey's.
Who?
Norman's motel manager, before he fired him, that is.
Have you seen him since?
No, I told him to get packing and he left.
That's all I know.
You sure?
Y-Yeah.
Well, that's about it then.
You can leave.
Just you, Norman, not the young lady.
Okay. But shouldn't I wait?
Don't worry.
I'll have her along presently.
Oh, forget the marker.
Get on in there.
Sheriff, I've been wanting talk to you.
Yeah.
Someone has been phoning Norman claiming to be his mother.
And not the dead Mrs. Bates, his real mother.
So?
So I've been wondering if it's possible that he was adopted?
Not that I've ever heard of, and I've lived my entire life here, Miss Loomis.
How did you find out who I was?
We're a tad slow around here, young lady, but not incompetent.
Now,
I've got a question for you.
Either you or your mother know anything about this?
No.
I don't see any point in either of you stayin' around
Fairvale any longer, do you?
Have we broken some law?
None that are on the books, but a whole hell of a lot of them that aren't.
Like all the ones having to do with right or wrong.
I'd say you and your mother just about broken every one of those, wouldn't you?
I didn't mean to.
Well, that's what
Norman said 20 years ago.
Only he was crazy.
Now, what's your excuse?
I guess I don't have one.
Well, I'll just say goodbye to you now then.
I expect it to be for the last time.
Sheriff.
I said goodbye,
Miss Loomis.
Sheriff, there's a car down here.
Anybody in it?
I can't tell.
It's stuck in the mud.
Well, get a winch line down to it and get it out of there.
All right, we found a car.
Doctor?
What are you doing here?
I followed Lila Loomis from her hotel to your house.
She came down here.
Oh.
Where is she?
I don't know.
But she was here.
It proves she was the one that was dressing up as your mother.
How?
If she wasn't gonna do it again, why would she sneak into your house?
But she wasn't the woman
I saw in the window.
She wasn't?
No.
Then who was?
That was my mother.
Norman, your mother's dead.
Remember the open coffin?
Mrs. Bates only took care of me.
My real mother is somebody completely different.
How do you know this, Norman?
She told me on the phone.
Norman, I've already proved to you that Mary and Lila Loomis were the ones who were calling you.
Would you accept the fact that you have no other mother than Mrs. Bates?
Of course.
Then that's what I'll do.
It would be a great load off my mind.
Okay, everybody stand back.
That's it.
Keep it comin'.
Looks like Toomey's car, doesn't it?
That's it, a little more.
We'll check inside before we open the trunk.
All right.
That's it.
Do you recognize it?
Okay, hold it right there.
Well?
Sheriff, it's empty.
Don't you have some place else to go?
Open the trunk.
Watch out,
Mike.
Oh, Jesus.
Norman. Norman!
What is it?
They found a car in the swamp.
Who? I don't know who it is.
They just found a car.
Isn't that enough? For what?
For them to arrest you!
I'll get your jacket!
Come on.
We're getting out of here.
How?
I don't know. We'll hitch a ride until we get a car.
Where would we go?
Somewhere, anywhere, Norman.
Please hurry.
They'd catch us.
You're right.
So what's the point of going?
Because it's my fault.
If my mother and I had left you alone, you would've been fine.
Nobody'd be dead, and I'd just be a dumb psych student with nothing on mind but having a good time.
It's not your fault.
Then whose fault is it?
My mother's.
She's the one who's been doing the killing to protect me.
She told me so herself.
Oh, Norman.
You're mad, don't you know that?
You're mad as a hatter.
Should I answer it?
Why bother?
It's only my mother, poor thing.
She shouldn't be calling.
She should be sitting back and gloating.
I better answer it.
Hello?
Norman, this is Dr. Raymond.
I just found Lila Loomis' car parked down the road.
I'm calling you from the motel parlor.
The calls that you've been receiving from your fictitious mother have been placed right here.
Lila Loomis has used this phone to call your house.
Yes.
L... I understand.
Mother?
Norman, this is Dr. Raymond.
I've been waiting for your call, Mother.
Hello. Lila?
Lila...
She's hung up.
No, Mother.
Mary's still here with me.
I like her.
No.
No, of course not.
Not as much as you.
No, I...
I won't do that.
You can't make me kill her.
Do I have to, Mother?
But why?
Why do I have to kill her?
Oh, no, Mother, please.
Please don't make me...
Oh, Mother,
How can you even think such a thing?
I can never do anything like that.
I don't think you understand about Mary, Mother.
She's really very kind.
I trust her.
She would never do anything to hurt me.
Norman? Norman.
Do you recognize me?
It's me, your mother.
Yes, Mother.
And since I'm standing here in front of you,
I can't very well be on the phone, can I?
So hang up the phone,
Norman. Hang up.
Yes, Mother.
Norman, put the phone down this instant!
Norman, this is your mother.
Norman, can you hear me?
Norman.
Norman, are you there?
Norman, please say something.
Norman.
Norman.
Got you!
Norman!
Norman, I...
I didn't mean to do it. L... I...
I thought he was you.
It's all right, Mother.
Norman, I'm not your mother.
It's all right.
Norman, I am not your mother.
I am Mary.
How many times have you killed?
How many times have I told you...
Norman, look,
I am Mary.
They're gonna come for you,
Mother, just like they did before.
Stay away from me.
And I'll cover up for you.
Now give me the knife.
Stay away.
I always have, because I'm your dutiful son.
Stay away.
And you're my loving mother.
So, please give me the knife.
It's time to go to the fruit cellar now, Mother.
Norman, stay away.
Mother, I don't want to...
Norman, now, look.
I don't want to hurt you, Mother.
You're coming.
In there, Mother, hurry.
Norman, please stop.
You... You need help.
You're losing blood.
You did it.
They're here.
Let me help you.
You killed them all.
Freeze!
The County Sheriff and the DA have come down from Bakersfield to confer with Sheriff Hunt.
Is that loud enough, guys?
Yeah, that... that's good.
Move over to your left.
I'll get the City Hall in the background.
Okay, we'll go in
Five, four, three...
You want to read through this and make sure it's exactly what you said.
Yeah, that's...
No, wait a minute.
She didn't say that.
She said if she didn't stay away, she'd be sorry.
Sorry.
Not that she'd kill him?
Can I get a cup of coffee? In a minute.
Everybody's getting coffee around here.
...the suspect, uh, wielding a big knife...
...the victim.
I drew myself...
So, she and her mother were trying to put Norman back in the asylum.
Well, that much we know for sure.
Then somethin' went wrong between them.
What?
They had a fight.
She wanted Lila to leave Norman alone, but she wouldn't.
We have a witness that heard the whole thing.
So she murdered her own mother over Norman?
Looks like it.
What about the bodies in the swamp?
The boy and that motel manager?
Mary and Lila Loomis did it.
They tried to blame the murders on Norman.
Or maybe only the daughter did it.
She definitely killed Dr. Raymond.
I'll tell you, If you had seen
Mary Loomis at the end, you wouldn't have questioned it.
She'd gone mad.
Dressed up in Norman's mother's clothes and a wig, trying to kill Norman, and him hardly even able to defend himself any longer.
Right till the end, she kept saying
Norman was the one who was crazy.
It was horrible.
What about it, Norman?
Are you ready to go home?
Lt'll all be in my report tomorrow, gentlemen.
Uh, let's go out the back.
Mrs. Spool.
Hello, Norman.
Come in.
I was just having some supper.
Nothing much, but would you like to share my toasted cheese sandwich?
Oh, no, thank you.
It's, uh,
Miss Spool, actually.
Oh.
You were expecting me.
Well, I was...
I was expecting someone.
I just wasn't sure of when.
Tea?
Please.
Milk and sugar?
That would be nice.
So, are you really my mother?
The name Spool doesn't mean anything to you?
No. Should it?
It was Norma Bates' maiden name.
The woman you thought was your mother was my sister.
I had you when I was very young out of wedlock.
I couldn't handle a brand-new baby, especially, uh, being by myself.
I had some trouble and the State put me away for a while.
That's when
Norma took you in.
You were less than a year old.
Too young to remember me.
She never mentioned me, did she?
No, she, uh, she didn't.
I guess she didn't want you to know that you had a mother who wasn't quite right.
But we know all about that, don't we, Norman?
Mmm-hmm.
After I got out, you'd already had your troubles and been committed.
I decided to wait for you.
Then when I saw what they were trying to do to my poor little boy,
I couldn't stand it.
So I followed them, and one by one...
After all, you're all I have in this world.
You're sure you won't have a sandwich?
Pardon?
I know how it is, Mother.
You've had a long day.
You must be tired.
I'll just put you to bed and tuck you in for the night.
I'll even say your prayers for you.
Would you like that?
I'm not sleepy.
Put me in my chair.
Yes, Mother.
And now, turn me to the window.
I want to keep my eyes on you.
Make sure you don't start playing
with filthy girls again.
Yes, Mother.
Good.
Well, what are you gawking at?
Go downstairs and open the motel.
What do you expect us to live on, hope?
No, Mother.
Remember, Norman,
I'm the only who loves you.
Only your mother truly loves you.
Señor.
- Have you seen this woman?
- No, señor.
Gracias.
Gracias.
No.
No?
No?
Señor. Señor.
Gracias.
Ten, 42, 36, hut, hut, hut!
Way to go, Brogan!
The old man can still catch, huh?
Take care of that shoulder.
Good job.
Nice snatch, for an old man, but watch this one.
Brogan!
I didn't like what I saw on Sunday.
What? I caught the winning touchdown.
You missed that track-back block on Cooper's run.
You were worried about your shoulder.
What's that gotta do with the operation.
There's no permanent damage.
I don't want any weaknesses that can be read by the other team.
You took yourself off the injured reserve.
You said you were healthy.
The shoulder is solid.
Why don't you prove that to me.
I intend to.
I mean right now.
Mrs. Wyler's paying you a lot of money to play football, not talk about it.
Why don't you go over to the sled and impress me.
The sled is bullshit.
I got two rookies who need playing time, Brogan.
Either go to the sled or sit on the bench.
No, Stassen. I'll go over there and prove it to you.
Sam! Go with him.
Yeah, come on, Sam.
No matter how long you play, they want you to prove it one more time.
North field scrimmage.
That guy's been on my ass since he got here.
Here we go.
All right, hand down.
Look at me. Ready.
Hit it!
Sam, get on it.
All right, hand down.
Look at me.
Hit it!
Argh! Fuck!
Sully! I'd like you to meet our county supervisor, Ed Phillips.
He's Mrs. Wyler's guest today.
- Hi, Ed.
- I'm a big fan.
Not only of the Outlaws, but of the kind of football you played.
Football's changed since
I was a player.
Right, right.
I guess that run of injuries kind of hurt you guys last season.
Yeah. We had a lousy bench last year.
We had to play a lot of injured ball players that shouldn't have been playing.
That's part of the job.
You telling us you never played injured?
Yeah, well, I was dumb.
I don't like my boys getting hurt permanently.
- That's why they call him "Mother".
- Hit it!
I don't know about being a supervisor.
I sure as hell don't know about being a lawyer.
But if I was a lawyer I wouldn't know shit about football, would I?
Excuse me.
Let's get out of here.
- Hit it!
- Ugh!
You don't have to do this, Brogan.
The fucker's not beating me.
Hand down again. Look at me!
- Hit it!
- Ugh!
I'm the trainer here, and I say he's had enough.
Hey, come on, Brogan.
What are you trying to prove?
You're a veteran!
What a dumb fucking thing to have me do!
Wait for me in my office, Brogan.
Steve Kirsch's office.
This is Terry Brogan.
I need to speak to Steve.
Yeah, the Outlaws just put me on waivers.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm a big fan of yours, Terry.
Hold, please.
It's Terry Brogan. He's been cut.
- Tell him to call Schumacher.
- He needs to talk to you.
I don't handle players anymore.
- Steve.
- Get rid of him.
Hello again. Mr. Kirsch can't talk right now, but he suggests you call Hal Schumacher.
I don't want Hal Schumacher,
I wanna speak to Steve.
When's he available?
I really don't know.
Thank you. Thanks a lot.
- They hurt my shoulder, then cut me.
- Shit!
That's it in a word.
They promised me they'd keep you.
This is behind my back, kid.
Yeah, I figured.
At first I thought they'd pay me off.
But fuck,
I want to play football.
Not this year.
Not with that shoulder.
Let me ask you something.
What makes you think they'll pay you off?
I was injured.
You played two games great.
If you were injured, you didn't look it.
What was I supposed to do, huh?
I could smell what they were thinking.
I give them any trouble, they cut me.
They cut you anyway.
They're rebuilding.
More profit, less talent.
You cost too much, my friend.
They're not screwing me around.
I'm gonna see my lawyer.
I'll miss the pressure, Hank.
Give me a call.
Caxton, Benjamin,
Parker and Stein.
Yes, he is. Hold on a moment.
Hello. May I help you?
- Yeah. I'm here to see Steve Kirsch.
- I'll ring his office.
Please have a seat.
Hello.
Hi.
I'm here to see Steve Kirsch.
I know.
I'm the one you've been talking to all day.
The one who's a big fan.
- Oh, right. What's your name?
- Edie.
Edie, I guess he's not ever going to talk to me?
Oh, you're down in my book to call.
- Where's his office?
- He's not here.
I know you gotta keep your job, Edie.
You have a nice face. I...
I'm telling you the truth.
It wouldn't be out of line for you to lie, would it?
No.
Where is he?
- Terry. It's good to see you.
- I've been cut from the Outlaws.
Yeah, I know, I heard.
The firm represents Mrs. Wyler.
Since I joined the firm,
I can't represent players.
Mrs. Wyler owns the Outlaws.
She's our biggest client.
It's a conflict of interest.
Wait a minute. Listen, Steve.
When you came hustling me in school,
I put my career in your hands.
Remember those times, please.
You're right, I'm sorry.
Sit down.
Now,
I've been playing injured.
They know that and they don't wanna admit it because they don't want to pay me off.
Yup. I think that's what their position's gonna be.
Their position's fucked.
I'll go to the Players' Association.
They'll back me.
You could do that, but listen.
What happens if the Outlaws prove that you're perfectly fine?
They've got film on you at practice, preseason games.
They're gonna fight for a long, long time.
Steve, look.
I'm having money problems, man.
I'm broke.
Terry. Did you spend every single cent you ever made?
Let me think for just a second here.
I should get you a low-interest loan to tide you over in the meantime.
- Excuse me...
- Could you just wait for a second, please?
And then I'll talk to these guys, see if I can soften their position and get you something so it's not such a big hassle for you.
Yeah?
Excuse me, Mr. Kirsch.
The reception?
Mr. Caxton's waiting.
Oh, right, I forgot. I gotta go.
Look, I gotta know something about this soon, Steve.
I'll get on it first thing.
Hey, you're one of my first players, huh?
Mike Hogan and his wife, Susan.
Ben Cassidy.
Thank you for coming.
Here's Hal Schumacher's number.
Call him. He's a nice man.
Do they always get bombed at the end of the day?
It's business down there.
It's an intimate fundraiser.
What do you mean?
Mr. Caxton has assessed every lawyer in the firm
$1500 to contribute to the reelection of Councilman Weinberg.
Mrs. Wyler is Caxton's biggest client, isn't she?
Yes. In fact, he's doing business for her right now.
Yeah? For the Outlaws?
No. Mrs. Wyler's real business is real estate.
Caxton wants a zoning variance on Mrs. Wyler's canyon so she can build houses there.
His guest of honor tonight could vote against it.
Trust me, he won't now.
I hate things like before, when I couldn't be straight with you.
I'm running out of conversation.
I'm sorry. Look, I gotta go.
I'd like to have a drink with you.
The Ginger Man, after work?
Okay, sure.
The Ginger Man.
Touchdown.
What are you doing here?
You been cut.
- They can get you for trespassing.
- I'd outrun them.
Why are you here, Tommy?
Jake wants to see you.
How is Jake?
He got stabbed last week.
What a shame.
He survived, Brogan.
Why does he want me?
- He might have a job for you.
- Heh, heh.
You tell him "No, thanks".
He'll be at the beach tomorrow.
There's a volleyball game.
Yeah? Is he playing?
I told you, he got stabbed, man.
Well, he lived, right?
You got problems now, Terry.
You want trouble too?
Come to the beach tomorrow.
You're not dumb.
Besides, what the hell else you got to do?
Sam!
Sam!
Sam! Come here!
Hey, you look good as a cripple.
Is that why I had to come here, after two years, to give you my opinion on that?
- Good to see you. How you doing?
- Lousy.
How's your life?
The club? The Palace is doing great.
The other business is even better.
My action's about half a million dollars a week.
You know the grand prize today for the two guys who win this thing? Thirty grand.
It's not bad, is it?
A few hours running on the beach.
Don't tell me you're taking action on this game?
You think these are beach rats running around here? Huh?
These guys are world-class players.
You didn't know that?
Sam! Sam, come here!
People love to bet on sports.
You know that. I just help them out.
Yeah, right.
South Bay guys love this fucking game, and they got money to burn.
I'll take their action.
Hey, who's the fuzzy face?
Do you want a cookie?
There's one! Whoa!
You fuzzy face, come on!
What kind of dog is gonna hang out with you, Jake?
He doesn't belong to me.
He belongs to the lady who cut me.
You're into violent women now, hm?
Look, I was a bit of an asshole.
I got crazy and popped her a few times.
She came after me with a knife.
Just missed my balls.
And was she going for them?
Don't they all?
- You got a new Porsche, huh?
- Yeah.
What the fuck, you're rich, right?
Let's talk it over at the Palace.
What do you say?
We'll get there like the old days.
You up to it?
No.
Come on, Sam. Come on!
Come on, get in the car.
I'll just meet you there.
You getting afraid of me in your old age?
Yeah, right.
Come on.
Be a good release. You don't need to release a little tension?
Do I have to tie one leg behind my back?
Take the old route.
Sunset.
Let's see if you still got balls!
- How'd you like that?
- All good!
Where were you?
That was smart. Ha, ha.
See you!
Shit.
You're still number two!
Dream on, Terry!
Jake!
Son of a bitch!
Shit.
What a fucking idiot!
Scared the shit out of you, huh?
No!
I'm an asshole for racing with you!
I'm pulling out!
Come on, don't pussy out on me now!
The fun's over, Jake!
Not yet!
- Hey. Sam, be quiet!
- Get over here.
What kept you?
I was getting worried.
I was afraid you flew out of your car got stuck in all that garbage.
Can't have a fair race with a goddamn maniac.
Here, maybe this will fix you up.
Come here.
Have a taste of this.
How about a Guinness?
Wanna tell me what
I'm doing here?
You're out of a job, right?
I've got some job possibilities for you.
For one, you can work right back here.
Celebrity bartender.
Making drinks and telling your football stories to drunks every night.
How does that sound?
You take the job.
You're a lot funnier than I am.
How about security guard?
I mean, you know how to get hit.
The point is, for a guy in your situation, Terry, the options stink.
Or you can find her for me.
Who's this, the knife lady?
She's very important to me, Terry.
I think about her the whole fucking time.
Hey, that's a new reality for you.
She stole 50 grand from me.
I would've given her the money.
I want her back.
And I want you to find her.
You're crazy. Why would you trust me with her anyway?
Jessie hates football players.
You think that's funny?
She's also Mrs. Wyler's daughter.
Did you ever meet her?
Jake.
I've heard about her.
She's supposed to be pretty wild.
Her father was this English guy
Mrs. Wyler use to be married to.
One of those London stage actors who comes over here, can't make it in American films.
Anyway, after he died,
Mr. Wyler adopted her.
An owner's daughter, living with a bookie.
That's something, isn't it?
She hates her mother. The woman treated her like a possession all her life.
You know what it feels like to be one of
Mrs. Wyler's possessions, don't you?
I'll give you $10,000 right now.
Pay your expenses.
And if you find her,
I'll give you 20,000 more.
You're crazy.
I'm a football player.
Without a team.
Hey, that new Porsche of yours, is it paid for?
What are you gonna do, man?
Sell insurance? I mean, that's it.
You don't have the personality to work for one of the networks.
Look, Terry.
I don't want you to bring her back, man.
Just find her. Tell me where she is.
What does that take?
Time and money.
You got the time right now.
I got the money.
Oh, great.
You know, I've never used what I got on you.
Could be otherwise.
I wouldn't want that. Would you?
It's simple.
Either you want to play football again or you don't.
You never change, do you?
Not a bit.
Try Mrs. Wyler. She's probably got an idea where Jessie is.
Right.
If this is about you being cut,
I don't involve myself with the day-to-day business of the team.
That's not why I came here,
Mrs. Wyler.
Oh?
Then suppose you tell me exactly what you want with me, Mr. Brogan.
I'm looking for your daughter.
We were very close, and she disappeared all of a sudden.
- Give me a break.
- What do you mean?
He sent you.
Who?
Jake...
Wise.
She was only with him to spite me.
I don't know what she did to get away from him.
What matters is, she got the hell away from him.
Why don't you drink to that?
Grace?
Hi.
Well, Ed seems to have solved the Soames problem.
The head of the planning commission is coming to your party Saturday.
We're finally softening up these environmentalists.
How wonderful.
You seem to have won the opposition over on your own.
A good project sells itself.
MOBSO's got lots of other mountains to save.
- You know Terry Brogan.
- How are you?
Okay.
- And Supervisor Phillips.
- I'm a big fan.
Thanks.
Ed, I wonder if you'd mind going ahead to the table. We'll be right along.
Oh, yes.
Yes, of course.
- Be with you in a minute.
- See you then.
Well, Ben, it seems Mr. Brogan has a new job.
Working for Jake Wise.
Looking for Jessica.
Oh.
You and Wise good friends?
I go to his club for the music.
So do a lot of the team.
Uh-huh.
Why don't you let us steal you away from him.
I won't let Jessica live like this.
I'll double whatever he's paying you.
I'm not some gun for hire.
He can't top what we can offer, can he, Ben?
He can't give you your job back with the Outlaws.
Well, we could consider something.
You know, it isn't easy for
Jessica to hide from me.
She's been drawing from her trust.
It's going to a little bank in Mexico.
To an island.
Cozumel.
You could keep a watch on her.
Make sure he gets nowhere near her again. Hmm?
You know, uh...
I think I used Jake Wise as an excuse to come here.
I guess I did come here to get my job back.
I didn't deserve what I got.
I played some damn good ball for you.
I got a lot of good years left.
Of course I want to be back on the team, but because I'm worth it.
Not because I spied on some
25-year-old who ran away from home.
I'm not going to spy for you or Jake Wise.
Ben, this young man is trespassing here.
Throw him out.
I don't believe you're wanted here.
And you can forget about Kirsch.
He's on my team.
You want the Outlaws to pay you off? Sue us.
Walk him to his car.
I can kick myself out, thanks.
Ten years' work, Grace.
And we're this close.
I think just a few members of the team would have been enough.
Having the Outlaws out here, full force, is kind of crowding it.
I have to get some use out of them.
I don't like football.
Ben!
Ben!
We got troubles.
Soames is here.
He's brought a lot of those
'Save the Mountain' people with him.
It doesn't look good.
Goddamn environmentalist bastards.
I think you'd better handle this.
Come on, Ed.
I can't believe he's doing this to us, Ben.
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Wyler.
- Hello.
I'm Bob Soames.
I'm on the County Planning Commission.
- But then you know that.
- Of course I do.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
It's been a long time coming.
I've brought a few of my friends.
I hope you don't mind.
Not at all.
Bob, are your friends from the Sierra Club?
Yes, as a matter of fact.
Quite a few of them.
I hope they're welcome here.
I've supported them for years.
Not only financially, of course, but also in my heart.
Please join us for refreshments.
- Oh, no, no. I really don't think so.
- Oh, come on.
Please.
All right.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, Ben.
He promised me.
Soames thinks he's a smart-ass.
I'm not laughing.
Cute little stores on the bottom.
"Zoning variances don't count."
I say, "Come on..."
What's it been, three weeks?
Could you excuse me for just a second?
What are you doing here?
Free eats, right?
Right. It's Mrs. Wyler's party.
You don't wanna be here.
That was total bullshit in your office, wasn't it?
You don't care about me.
You work for Caxton.
You wanted to play pro football, right?
Every year, there's a 25 percent chance you'd lose your job because of injury.
You players never grasp, it is not a very secure job.
A lot of us made you rich, didn't we?
That's right, Brogan. I got rich.
I'm getting still richer all the time.
That's good, Steve.
- Come on, come on.
- God.
You can afford it when I kick your teeth in!
Do it, see what happens!
You're a has-been!
Cool it, man.
Come on, goddamn it!
That's intelligent.
- Will you cool it?
- You know Caxton's here.
Hey, come on.
Relax.
You're finished in football!
- Get him out!
- I'm out of here!
- You're not playing this right.
- I could give a fuck.
Mr. Wyler never mixed his other businesses with the team.
We played football.
We didn't sell real estate.
You're saying I'm lucky to be off the team?
It's a new goddamn ball game.
That's all I'm telling you.
It's all bullshit!
I don't belong here either.
It's a goddamn circus!
- I'm hearing weird things about you.
- Heh, heh. Like what?
Like you might be going to work for Jake Wise.
He offered me a job.
But you turned him down.
You're a smart kid. Wait.
You're worried about money, but don't screw around with Wise.
I'll make a call.
I'm gonna get you a coaching job.
Just for the year.
I'm not ready to do what you do.
I'm a player!
There's nothing here for me now but shit!
They won't pay me my money.
My shoulder's screwed up.
Know what
I'm telling myself to do?
Take Wise's money.
Take a damn vacation!
I'll find his rich girl for him and lay in the sun.
Have a good season, Hank.
- Terry!
- I'm on my own.
Keep away from Wise, damn it!
Thank you.
Jessie?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
No.
Jessie?
You're Jessie Wyler, aren't you?
I'm Terry Brogan.
I played ball for the Outlaws.
The Outlaws don't interest me.
I'm not playing this season.
Gracias.
Say, there's not much going on here.
Where can I go to have a good time?
Get off the island.
The ferry leaves every morning.
- Can I buy you a drink or something?
- Nope.
How about a taco, huh?
I guess you can have anybody do that for you in L.A., huh?
- What's that?
- Have some football player buy you a couple tacos and a beer.
There are a lot better things to do.
Even in L.A.
What is it you don't like exactly?
Football players, tacos or beer?
I like tacos and I like beer.
Hey!
I should take the ferry, huh?
I figure if I keep talking, you won't disappear.
Bye.
You sure about that?
Hey!
Yeah?
Hey, Jake. How's it going?
No, nothing yet.
No.
Hey, I didn't expect to have signs telling me where she is, you know?
I don't know.
Maybe I'll be outside having a drink,
I'll look over and, out of nowhere, she'll be buying some fruit or something.
I'll call you in a few days.
All right. See you. Bye.
Hey, pretty slick, Roberto.
Okay, señor. Cerveza, no glass.
Gracias. I've been hanging out here a lot, huh?
Sí.
Some hangout.
Damn it!
- Where's that boat going?
- Tulum.
- When's the next ferry?
- Six hours.
Shit!
Should I be afraid of you?
I don't know.
It's beautiful, huh?
If this were L.A., my stepfather would've bought it.
Torn it up and built condominiums.
Here, the land intimidates them.
They leave it in peace, thank God.
Some spot.
It's nothing like the great
Maya cities of the Yucatán.
Chichén Itzá.
Should have hidden there.
Is that what you're doing? Hiding?
Yep.
From you, right?
What do you mean?
Jake sent you.
Maybe your mother did.
Hey, I wouldn't know which one had more to threaten you with.
You wanna know the truth?
I came for the hell of it.
I wanted to get out of L.A. An island in the Caribbean didn't sound too bad.
Only trouble is, now I'm here I find myself in the middle of something
I have absolutely no feeling for.
Well, you're not doing this for free.
You're getting paid well, aren't you?
Which one are you working for?
Which one knows you found me?
Nobody knows anything, okay?
Oh, sure!
I figure, fuck them. You know?
Fuck you too, lady.
I loved your drawing.
Yeah?
I wanna talk to you.
Talk.
Why should I believe you won't tell Jake where I am?
Hey, look, there are probably people who care what you believe. I don't see them in the room.
I have a broken shoulder, both my knees are shot, there are guys crippling themselves now so you can act like a 13-year-old runaway from some mansion in Bel Air.
I could really give a shit what you believe.
- How's Sam?
- Who?
My dog.
I don't know.
Looks like he's being fed.
I think you were right.
I shouldn't be afraid of you.
When you leaving?
I think 4:00.
I wish it were sooner.
Never found where I live, did you?
I don't think anybody could.
It's the prettiest place on the island.
Don't leave without saying goodbye.
You take the highway out of town to kilometer 19.
When you see the three Tecate cans,
it's the first dirt road on the right.
Don't leave without saying goodbye.
Don't leave without saying goodbye.
You don't have to worry about the neighbors.
They were building homes here when a storm hit.
They all fell down except this one.
- Waited for you, huh?
- Yeah.
Like a drink?
All right.
That'd be great.
Tequila okay?
That's great, yeah.
It's Maya.
Third century, I think.
- No ice.
- That's all right.
You don't have any electricity here, huh?
No.
Propane.
So how'd you end up with Jake?
The Palace, I guess.
I wanted to be a rock 'n' roll singer.
Jake convinced me that rich girls don't have the soul for it.
Sounds like Jake. Always convincing somebody of something.
It seems I have the soul to live with him, be his girlfriend.
Well, he never had anybody like you before, I can tell you that.
You're a whole different class for him.
Not really.
My family didn't get to own most of Bel Air by being honest.
Jake always thought
I was his luck.
I helped him outthink people like my family.
I know why he wanted you.
But why were you with him?
I liked that my being with him made a lot of people crazy.
Like your mom?
It even frightened her.
And that was really something to finally pull off.
If only my brother had done that and not by killing himself.
Your brother killed himself?
I guess.
He got into drugs for the same reason I did.
To get away from our terrible life.
Did his dying make you stop?
No.
Jake did.
Jake did?
After I was with him awhile, it became very important to him that I stop.
Wouldn't leave me alone.
Kept after me until I quit.
The truth is I wanted to quit.
When I did,
I didn't need Jake anymore.
Bet that kind of threw him, huh?
He said the only way I could get away from him was to kill him.
Well, you almost did.
Not really.
I'm gonna stay away from Jake.
And my mother.
Good.
I ought to get going.
Why?
What'd you come here for?
You know, this is the best
I've felt in years.
I think you're incredible.
You do?
Yes, I do.
There's a great canyon down there.
Let's go back down there.
Don't you ever have to breathe?
Come on, it's good therapy for my shoulder.
This is a dream, you know that?
It's true! I've completely forgotten about football.
- You liar!
- Hey!
That's the first thing you've said I don't believe.
Hey, come here! It's true!
Then come in here and prove it!
I'm not coming in there!
Whoo!
Come on, guapo.
It's good therapy for your shoulder.
Ay, caramba!
Ay, caramba!
You know, I thought Jake would send someone awful.
- How do you know I'm not awful?
- Maybe I'm no different than Jake.
We haven't left each other's side for the last two weeks.
I figure I know who you are,
Terry Brogan.
- Jess.
- Hmm?
You know... when I got my pro contract, it was the first real money
I ever had.
It wasn't much because my lawyer took a big hunk out of it.
But still,
I bought everything in sight.
And the girl that I was living with at the time, she moved out on me when I was on the road.
Took all my furniture with her.
It seems funny now, but at the time it flipped me out.
I was under a lot of pressure, trying to make the starting lineup.
I started acting crazy, hanging out with Jake.
We got along great.
He was as crazy as I was.
And after a couple of years,
I got my ass into debt.
I mean, really badly.
And I made a deal with him to shave points.
You know, you don't have to tell me this, okay?
I'm supposed to stop now, or something?
You said you know me.
Well, you don't. I want you to.
It was a game during the playoffs.
We were expected to win by a four-point spread.
I was supposed to see we didn't win by so fucking much.
I kept putting off doing anything about it because I was feeling so good.
You know, blow the other team out.
In the fourth quarter, they scored
14 points. Everything was great.
The point spread was four.
We were ahead by three.
I didn't have to do anything.
Then the quarterback, he threw this pass.
Put it right into my hands.
It was just so perfect I just had to catch it, you know.
All I had to do was just drop the fucker.
But my reflexes took over.
So their guy tackled me on the five... and I fumbled. I, uh...
I just made my hands let go of the ball.
It scared the shit out of me.
I thought everybody in the stadium, all 55,000, knew I was a son of a bitch.
So you won by three instead of four points.
Jess, if another player would have done that, you'd have to pull me off of him quick, or he'd be dead.
It's still torturing you, isn't it?
See, I do know who you are.
Do you know what I wish?
I wish I'd seen you play football.
I bet you were wonderful.
God.
I can see how Jake would go crazy without you.
God, Jess.
All from Jake.
They stopped coming in four days ago.
We should leave here, you know.
Oh, Terry, I don't want to leave.
It's so perfect here.
Yeah, I know.
We have no choice, though.
Well, I don't have much money left.
Can't draw from my trust for another three months.
Jake's money's all gone?
What do you mean, Jake's money?
He said you took, uh,
50 grand from him.
Steal from him, when I want him off me?
I'd be out of my mind.
I didn't take a cent of his goddamn money.
Well, I've got the money he gave me so...
Hey, I'll go to the hotel in the morning and get my bags.
We'll cover our tracks, huh?
But you have to go to
Chichén Itzá alone, okay?
I gotta get Jake off our trail.
Okay.
God, where have you been, Terry?
I've had 10 days in this horrible place.
I found a guy to get us a house in Oaxaca.
- Anywhere but here.
- I hope he's for real.
It'll cost all I've got.
- You don't know what it's like here.
- Where are we going?
- Come on, people can see us.
- If they can, who cares?
Jess, come on.
Will you cool it?
Come on, you know we had to separate.
Jake thinks I'm all over the place looking for you.
I've been to Mexico City,
Cuernavaca, Taxco.
Jessie. Hey.
I wired Jake.
He thinks you're in Campeche.
I wonder, when was the last time someone used this court?
Fourteen or 15 centuries ago, maybe.
The games they had here must've been incredible. Look at this.
They even wore facemasks, had shoulder pads.
Games were a little more serious than the ones you play, Terry.
They'd play for days. The team that lost got their heads chopped off.
And the guys who bet on the game, wagered themselves, even their children.
And if they lost, they were slaves.
You're going crazy here, aren't you?
I think I'd be crazy if I weren't.
We're getting out.
To go where?
Another place we don't belong?
We could do better.
With what?
Jess.
I don't have the money Jake and your mother have, but so what?
I'm taking care of you, aren't I?
Jess.
There's money in Mexico City.
- What do you mean? Whose money?
- Mine.
Yours?
Jake's.
- Why didn't you tell me this before?
- I couldn't trust you for sure.
Since when couldn't you trust me?
- In the beginning.
- What beginning?
We've been in this 10 minutes after we saw each other.
Hey, tell me. When did you start trusting me?
Terry, it was a risk to trust you, all right?
That's funny.
I never thought of it that way.
I took the risk by letting you come with me.
You let me come with you?
Yeah. It would've been different if I were alone.
What, do you think I'm caging you in or something?
Well, it's true, isn't it?
I'm standing in your way of freedom?
I'm keeping you from your money in Mexico City?
You're twisting what I say.
Hey, Jesus, I love you.
You've become everything I'm about!
Don't you understand?
Can't anyone love me without it being life or death to them?
Most people are afraid they're never going to be loved like that.
Terry, wait!
I've lied and used people all my life because
I thought that's what everybody did.
Everyone except my brother, and look where it got him.
It's just so hard for me to trust anyone.
I'm not anyone.
I know.
I know you're not, and I'm trying.
I want to trust you.
God, I love you.
I love you.
Come on.
The park's closing.
Let's go to the sweathouse.
Okay.
Terry.
There's somebody in here.
- Where?
- There's somebody there.
Sully.
- What the fuck...-?
- Sorry I walked in on you like that.
Walked in on me?
What the hell are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
What are we doing here?
You're in a lot of trouble.
I came to talk some sense into you, I guess.
You came here to talk to me?
Terry, if a tired old guy like me can find you...
I don't understand.
What are you talking about?
Who is he, Terry?
It's Hank Sully.
He's with the Outlaws.
Jake sent him.
That's crazy.
I know his name!
He called Jake at the house.
Talk to me, Sul.
Why did you leave the team in the middle of the season?
Come on, talk!
What do you want from me?
That jackass Caxton and her old lady screwing up the team.
You know, if Mr. Wyler were alive,
I'd be head coach.
I think about that a lot, Terry.
So I just figured, fuck it!
I'd do something for me for a change.
I was close to you guys. I knew who was in debt, and how deep.
So when Jake wanted,
I could always finger who was ready to break.
You're going home from here with nothing. You know that.
Wise will send someone a lot tougher than me, Terry.
Hank, come on.
Man, this is crazy.
- How much trouble are you in?
- Enough.
- I'm sorry.
- Come on, Terry.
Hold it!
Hank. Come on, man.
You said you were old and tired, you're not out of your mind too, are you?
Hank, come on.
This is Terry, man.
You're talking to him like he's a friend.
You don't know him.
Just let me take her back with me.
Who's gonna hurt her? Wise?
He worships her.
Back off, Sully.
Goddamn you, Terry!
She's worthless!
Come on, Terry.
You're no good at this.
It was easy to find you.
Mexico City, Cuernavaca.
I was breathing down your neck and you didn't know it.
Come on, Terry.
I'm taking her back!
Son of a bitch!
Jessie!
Damn it, Sully!
Go on and get it, Terry!
Stop it!
Get off him!
Hank!
You jackass!
Terry! Goddamn it.
Stop!
- Come on, Terry.
- Okay, stop.
- Stop!
- Shut the fuck up!
Back off, Sully.
Get away, please!
- Get away!
- See what you've done?
Give me that fucking gun.
He grabbed the gun, Terry.
I couldn't help it.
Come on, let's get out of here.
- He's not dead!
- He will be, Terry.
There's no one to help him.
She's right.
Maybe I'll stop bleeding.
What do you think?
Sure. Sure.
You're full of shit, Brogan.
- We gotta do something...
- Do what?
Take him to a Mexican jail, with a body and a gun?
Are you crazy?
It's not our fault.
We can explain it.
We can't, Terry! Let's just get out!
Let's go! Let's run!
This isn't something we can run from anymore!
Oh, God! You're so innocent!
You just don't understand! Do you?
Come on, Sul, hang in there.
Bury me here, Brogan.
Forget that shit, will you?
What are we doing down here?
Hank.
Jess?
Jessie!
Jess!
Jessie!
Jess!
Oh, God. Jess, no!
Give it to me.
All right, I'm not spiking.
- I got it. I got it.
- Get it.
Nice. You playing with your high heels on?
- Impressive.
- Terry.
Now see, if I like a guy and it looks like I'll never see him again,
I don't worry.
You know why?
Because I always get lucky.
Thanks, honey.
You're working up a sweat.
That's good.
I love sports, Terry.
You know that.
Okay.
An Outlaws game is starting.
Come on up.
Tommy, head into town.
Call me after the games, okay?
So did you notice?
I'm walking without a limp.
You got your life together, Jake.
I'm impressed.
You know, Ter, there's never just one game.
There's always a whole mess of them.
Like life.
You get hit hard by one, you get blessed by a couple of others.
You still like football, don't you?
I love the game, myself.
Business and pleasure.
You got a new conditioning coach.
Did you know that?
Sully's gone.
When the hell are you going to tell me?
What happened to you down there?
I decided it was a shit job.
So you just walked away from it?
You still looking for her?
- Didn't you find her yet?
- It's none of your business, Terry.
You didn't finish the job, so I don't owe you the rest of the money. Okay?
I figure you just came over today to say we're still friends.
- Am I right? Tell me I'm right.
- No.
No. I just wanted to tell you to your face to eat it.
That's nice.
You mentioned having something on me?
You hang me, you hang yourself.
Go to hell.
It's not that easy, Terry.
There's other people involved.
It's just not you and me.
If you want to play football again, there's something you gotta do.
Another job.
It's gonna help both of us.
You didn't hear what I said, did you?
It's finished with us.
Don't you feel you owe me just a little something?
Hello, Terry.
She look great, or what?
Christ, would you look at that defense, huh?
It's like the whole team's gone out of shape without Sully.
Sully is missed.
I can tell you that.
Don't leave.
Stay and watch the game, man.
If you want, you can even place a bet.
Some other time.
Oh, hey. There's a party at the Palace tomorrow night.
You'll hear some good music.
And I'll tell you all about that job.
This is something you've got to do for yourself.
Because your career's all you got now, my friend.
So I'll expect you, right?
Hey, get out of there!
Get out!
Get out of there!
Have you been all right?
Wait till I get my wind back, will you?
Get your dog out of here.
Come on, Sam.
I think about you.
I think about you too, lady.
- Let's leave it at that, huh?
- You've gotta understand who I am.
Someone's always been there to take care of things.
You couldn't handle what happened to Sully.
I had to come back.
It was either Jake or my mother.
And I couldn't go to her.
Terry, he knows about Sully.
What's he know?
What did you tell him?
Terry, he could hurt us.
You mean he could hurt me.
Just do what he wants and finish it with him.
Are you scared for me, Jess? Huh?
Yes.
You know, I've been down there looking for you.
I came back hoping somebody might know something.
I was worried about you.
You came back to this fuck.
I love you.
Oh, yeah, I noticed.
Todd, how you doing?
Let's go upstairs and talk some football.
- You're here to watch the show.
- Catch me when I'm in the mood.
Tommy.
Hang out at the bar.
You want to talk, maybe Tommy will listen.
Look, Jake, he never writes anything down.
I don't even know if he can write.
- Hey.
- I don't trust...
Watch your mouth when you fucking talk about Tommy. Do you hear me?
Now if not, okay, go play your money someplace else. Hi. How are you? Go on.
Go on.
I'll be in the bar.
He'll be at the bar.
Hi. How are you?
Nice to see you.
Glad you showed up.
That's nice.
Came to get your stink off me.
Listen, pal, I'm not the one who blew this friendship, okay?
- Where's Jessie?
- She stayed at home. She's upset.
I don't know what it could be.
What you think?
- I think you've got a lot of friends.
- Go mingle with them. Okay?
Tommy, show Terry to his table.
Talk to you later.
I want something in return.
I want a complete catalog on Bob Marley.
Everything, all the records.
And I want live concerts.
Everything.
- Listen, if I ask him to...
- Hi.
You heard about this band?
No.
It's supposed to be great,
I can't wait.
What are you doing here?
If you have something to say to me, say it and get out.
This guy looks familiar. Why?
Listen, smart ass, just get out of here.
Okay.
Uh, Tommy?
Hey, Tommy.
Go ahead.
Hey, Tommy!
- This guy a friend of yours?
- Go ahead.
This guy the show, or what?
Sit down!
You're such a prick.
Thank you!
Well, the good news is that some of my best friends are here tonight.
The bad news is, the rest of you are here.
It's a good thing I'm in the music business instead of in comedy.
Okay, a great act tonight, straight from my hometown.
Where's my hometown?
Nueva York, New York City.
The Big Apple. Yeah!
Rotten to the core, as tonight's group will aptly demonstrate.
They think of themselves as tropical gangsters, but we like to call them
Kid Creole and the Coconuts.
Planning Commissioner Soames.
Dealing with politicians now.
I'm a top sports accountant.
Bob Soames has been a client for a long time.
I only deal with uptown people.
Like this guy I'm sitting with?
Kirsch? As a matter of fact, this job I have for you, it's got to do with Kirsch.
You're really coming up in the world.
Lawyers, politicians.
I've done business with Kirsch for a long time.
Yeah. Sully too.
Sully kept me up on injuries that might affect upcoming games.
Kirsch let me know what players wouldn't have their contracts renewed.
I had it great.
It's a shitty business, Jake.
Well, it's a shitty world, Terry.
You see, Kirsch and Sully fixed a game behind my back.
Kirsch placed what I thought was an off-the-wall bet.
But when he won big,
I paid the cocksucker.
I guess he figured when I lost Jessie,
I was ripe for being screwed.
Must be an epidemic.
- How'd you find out?
- Your friend.
Sully.
Kirsch, the greedy son of a bitch, cheated Sully on his cut.
So he came up here, figured there would be some money telling me about it.
Poor fucking Sully.
I'd like to kick the shit out of Kirsch.
The asshole's got files on me.
And I'm the dumb fuck who's supposed to get them for you?
He's got records of the games.
Of the business I did with the players.
Know who that includes?
You got no smart-mouth remark for that one?
Here. These will get you into
Kirsch's building and the office.
Sunday night. Late.
It's a little dirty, but not so dirty you won't sleep nights.
Why me? Why not Tommy?
I want Tommy clean.
You? I was ready to be your friend for life.
You owe me.
This is what I want from you.
It's in our mutual interest.
As far as I'm concerned, it finishes all the shit between us.
I'm missing the show.
What the hell made you think you could handle Jessie?
I bet you brought her flowers.
You don't have to do that when you're living in the jungle.
You just take her outside, show her what tree you're gonna do it under.
Hell, we hit lots of trees.
Shit! Now you follow me into the fucking toilet.
Give me a break, please.
- What is this?
- It's a warning. Be careful.
Okay, Terry. I'm going to be very careful, all right?
Just fuck right off.
You think we're sitting at the same table by accident? Hm?
I figure the bet was you'd make a scene. We'd be noticed.
Really? Hm.
I'm looking out for myself.
I've done what I can for you.
Okay, fuck off.
I keep thinking of what I did to make me deserve you.
Go to hell.
Oh, I have.
You know that, lady!
What's it like with Jake? Huh?
When you two are doing it?
Is he good?
Shut up, Terry!
Does he have a bigger cock than I do? Huh?
Shut up!
Do you know what he wants me to do for him?
You and I have seen worse.
Jake's a gambler. He thinks I took his luck when I took you.
I hit him too hard.
Then get out of it now.
But what about all the things you and I shared, Jess? Hm?
What about Sully?
Hm?
You remember him?
That guy we killed down there in the jungle.
He's got me one way or the other, doesn't he?
Huh? Doesn't he?
Yeah, go ahead, you rip the shirt off. Come on.
Rip the shirt off.
Rip the fucking shirt off!
What am I gonna do, Jess?
Oh, Terry! I'm sorry.
- I'm so sorry.
- I love you.
Hold me.
Hold me.
What are we gonna do?
Is this Sam?
Is this Sam? I bet it is Sam, is it?
There's Sam.
Sam's crazy about me.
That's a fact.
You know, dogs kill for people they love.
Maybe Sam knows
I'd kill for you.
- What do you mean?
- See that?
Now you're looking at me.
Why do I have to frighten you to get you to look at me?
I give you everything you want.
Your mother and Caxton can't stomp on me.
You're not even afraid of them anymore.
Jake.
You know, when you came at me with a knife, all I could think of was that you'd hurt yourself.
I'm not spitting in your face.
I just want you to let me go.
When we were first together, it was so great.
I finally impressed those fucks in Beverly Hills. Remember?
You know what was even better?
You were smart.
You really helped me.
But I don't care about any of that now.
I need you.
It's just not okay to be alone anymore.
No, Jake.
No.
You ruined my life.
Goddamn it, I'm not gonna lose you.
He's got files on the business I did with the players.
You do want to play ball again, don't you, Terry?
Sunday night.
Late.
It's a little dirty, but not so dirty you won't sleep nights.
Steve?
Steve?
This is the rest of what Jake owes you...
Jesus Christ! What?
I hid the body.
They'll find it sooner or later.
He killed him?
- He had him killed?
- Shh. Edie.
Oh, my God.
Not that it's any great loss, but...
Look, Jake Wise planted something up in his office to frame me.
I didn't find it in time.
Oh, they're all bastards.
- All of them.
- Look, Edie, I need your help.
You worked with Kirsch for a long time.
You could knock the hell out of them.
What do you mean?
I don't know what Jake planted.
But Kirsch kept a tiny treasure chest that could blow everybody up.
I shouldn't be this drunk.
Listen, if the booze helps...
I can't believe this is my life. Ugh.
Where was this box?
Terry...
I'd be too scared to do it.
You worked for Kirsch. You knew most of what he knew. They know that.
Edie, they'll kill you too.
Edie, help me.
- But it means...
- What?
Going back there.
To Kirsch's office.
There shouldn't be a dog in here.
Who the hell are you?
I worked for Kirsch.
You must be the one who unemployed me.
Sit.
- Are the others here?
- Mm-hm.
They're all over the building.
Looking for the body.
Some mess.
We're gonna find him.
Jake wants certain things out of the office right away.
Why?
I guess he's a little jumpy.
Things seem to be disappearing tonight, don't they?
Your dog bothers me.
It's supposed to bother people.
Put him in there, please.
No.
You're making this take much more time than it has to.
Mister...
Mr. Wise is waiting for me.
Listen, you're not a security guard.
But I belong here.
Now put the goddamn dog in there!
Come on.
Stay.
Yeah?
Hello, Mr. Wise.
No, we haven't found Kirsch's body.
Don't worry about it.
Don't get excited. We'll find it.
Gonna take it a floor at a time.
I'm sure of it.
No, we're in the office looking for those papers you wanted.
The ones you asked that girl to get.
Hey, come back here!
- Get back!
- You crazy bitch!
Who are you? Goddamn it!
Who the hell are you?
You little punk! You're dead!
Argh!
Run, Edie!
Come on!
Edie!
- Did you get the papers?
- Yes, I got them!
Hey!
- Here, I'll park it for you.
- I live here.
Jessica.
Hello, Mother.
You're looking well.
I need to see Ben.
I've missed you.
Please get Ben, Mother. Please.
He's much too busy celebrating.
Bob Soames changed his vote on Wyler Canyon.
Why do you want Ben?
I just wanna talk to him about something.
- You can talk to him tomorrow.
- No, I need to speak to him now!
- Right now!
- Keep your voice down.
I'll embarrass you, Mother.
I'll just walk right in there and I'll be my sweet self.
Hello, Jessie.
Hello, Ben.
I have to talk to you, alone.
- Excuse us.
- Sure.
Let's go in there.
- Jake's had Kirsch killed.
- What?
He's made it look like Terry did it.
He was trying to get Terry for what he did with me, but it's more than that.
He's been fixing games and betting against his own bank.
Kirsch was making the bets for him.
Something's going down at Kirsch's office.
- Brogan wouldn't have gone back.
- Why would he?
He'd be crazy to.
Would you get over there and find out what's going on? Come on.
You've gotten out of hand, Jake.
Come on, Tommy.
What've you done to me?
He's here to help me, not hurt you.
The things you don't know.
This man that you, your mother and everybody thinks so much of, he's my bank.
I work for him.
Ben?
Yeah.
Ben. You told him everything, didn't you?
Didn't you?
Oh, God.
You're still trying to kill me.
This time I might just be dead.
Jake.
I love you, Jessie.
Why did that have to be a bad thing?
I tell you,
I didn't mean anything bad.
Your office is still busy.
Yeah?
That you, Brogan?
Here.
Hello, Brogan.
Who's this?
Hey, Señor Caxton!
Couldn't catch the game tonight.
We won. Listen, Brogan,
I'm getting into this because of my goddaughter, Jessica.
I'll tell you, there's somebody else you gotta help tonight, Caxton.
Yourself.
I've just been in Kirsch's safe.
You know what he had in there?
The goods on you,
Supervisor Phillips, a whole lot of people.
I know all about Soames.
You know, the commissioner who wanted to protect the environment but liked to bet on football too.
Guess he found out the two don't mix, didn't he, Caxton?
I think we should meet.
I got no problem with that.
As a matter of fact, I know a great place.
Wyler Canyon, in an hour.
The spot where you're gonna break ground in a couple of weeks.
I know the place.
That idiot football player you were going to get has got me by the balls.
Come on.
Jessie.
You too, Wise.
Your friend Brogan is a threat to me, Jessie.
I don't know what he wants, but it's got to be settled. Tonight.
I can't believe this is you, Ben.
I think my mother would snap if she knew.
I get things done in this town.
And the people I work for, like your mother, have no interest in how that happens.
Just that I do it.
She wants Wyler Canyon developed, but she can't get through to everybody with campaign contributions.
So I have to go into business with some very strange people.
Like that asshole next to you.
I don't have to take this from you, Caxton.
He's as dirty as I am, Jessie.
He owns 75 percent of the book and 75 percent of the club.
I take all the heat while he sits on his ass.
Shut him up, Tommy!
He got you into this. Now convince me you're not an asshole.
Come on, Tommy.
They'll never let you sit on top.
When you had Kirsch killed, you buried yourself.
You think they'll ever do business with you?
Wise up!
I'm telling you no one in Beverly Hills is ever gonna do business with a black man.
Shut up, Jake.
You're a dead man.
Not yet, Caxton.
Brogan won't beat anybody.
I'll take care of him.
You still need me.
Put that gun away.
Take it, Jake.
My best friend?
Brogan!
- Watch it, they've got a gun!
- Shut up, Jessie!
That's okay, Jessie!
Things have a way of getting messed up when you're in them.
I don't expect the best.
What the hell are you doing, Brogan?
This mountain's pretty important to you, isn't it, Caxton?
With what I got from Kirsch's safe,
I can knock all your plans to hell!
Mrs. Wyler wouldn't like that, would she?
What do you want?
- Don't shoot!
- Terry!
You're trying to kill me!
What do you think I want?
I wanna stay alive!
What do you want?
I didn't want you, Caxton!
I want Jake's shit out of my life!
Now I want yours out too!
That's all you want?
Why don't I believe you?
Because you're a corrupt old man.
Your coverage stinks, Tommy.
What's your deal, Brogan?
I found out tonight Jake jumps for you.
Slap him down.
It's that fucking simple, Caxton.
I'll keep Kirsch's stuff until I'm satisfied.
That can be arranged.
Are you crazy?
Don't let this punk beat you.
It can still work. Sully the trainer,
Kirsch the lawyer, and Brogan the player, all cheating each other on the fix!
- Knock it off, Jake!
Drop the gun.
Drop the fucking gun.
Take the gun away from her head.
You're not gonna hurt her.
You wanna gamble with me, Terry?
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Take the gun away.
You were my friend. You know me.
Take your shot.
Don't do it, Terry.
He won't hurt me.
I'm not gonna take that chance.
Thattaboy.
Don't think about it, Tommy.
I'll blow you away. Step back.
Step fucking back.
Who's gonna be a dead man, Caxton?
Not me.
It's gotta be Terry.
What makes somebody your friend, Jake?
How much shit they're willing to do for you?
Jake. Jake, don't do it.
Don't... Jake, I love him!
Right in my face.
Right in my fucking face.
I'll blow him the fuck...
Jessie.
Keep away from her, Brogan.
You can't help her with this.
But you can, Caxton.
I think so.
But it means doing things my way.
I want that stuff from Kirsch.
And Jessie's going back where she belongs.
You'll leave him alone, Ben.
I'll do what you want, but you'll leave him alone.
What I'm most happy about is the opportunity to share this land.
It's beauty and the beauty around it won't be sitting up here alone anymore, just going to waste.
I'm sharing what I believe is the best location on the West Side.
Close to Century City and the ocean.
We won't crowd the hillsides.
Each owner will feel that the canyon belongs to him.
A sanctuary from the crowding and crime of the city below us.
Specifically, I'd like to acknowledge three public officials without whose generous support we wouldn't be here:
Supervisor Ed Phillips,
Councilman Leonard Weinberg...
Stay here.
Just remember your promise, Ben.
And the head of the commission,
Bob Soames.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Now for the big moment.
This was the only way you could get a look at her, eh?
Nothing stops progress, does it?
We had to put it off for six months until things died down in the press.
Moving 5 million yards of earth out of here.
Enough to fill dump trucks from here to Nova Scotia.
This town does belong to people like you, doesn't it?
You and her mother control what she says, what she does.
There's nothing in the news that isn't exactly the way you wanted it.
Jake Wise did things even he'd freak out about.
There's a lot of sympathy for her.
Well, there should be.
It didn't seem to hurt you, Brogan.
I heard you got some tryouts with good teams.
I'm playing with the Dolphins next season.
That's one you couldn't put a stop to, could you?
I'll be ready.
Couple of good years and I'll quit on my own terms.
So you're going to leave L.A. Good.
Look, when you need me in court,
I'll be there for her.
But forget anything else.
Remember, Brogan, you're out of her life.
I figure that's up to her.
You're not gonna control us forever.
Believe me.

Listen, listen. I expect you people to take me seriously, you know?
You are being taken perfectly seriously here, sir.
As a matter of fact, you have a special treatment.
Usually we fill out this form after a week or so.
Usually we just take a deposition.

Okay? This is the procedure.
Photo.
You see, the thing is, even if they find Mrs. Walker...
...they cannot disclose her whereabouts without her consent.
Unless you get the attorney to make a formal request.
What are you talking about?
Why wouldn't my wife want me to know where she's at?
You and your wife have been to Paris before?
Yes, on our honeymoon.
Is it possible she met someone then, someone she has been thinking about?
Since June 15, 1968?
Please, don't take offense.
I'm an ex-cop.

- That's right.
- Is there something I can do for you, sir?
- Yes. My wife, do you remember my wife?
- Yes.
She ieft the hotel this morning while you were on duty, I think.
- Did you see her?
- Yes, I spoke to her.
What did she say?
She asked me to send up some toilet articles...
...and then she ieft with the man who had called her.
- I don't understand. The man who...
- Well, a man...
...asked me if Mrs. Walker was staying at the hotel.
I said she was. So he called your room.
Then, a few minutes later, your wife came down...
...she asked me to get her some toothpaste, a toothbrush and...
How do you call to take off makeup?
Take makeup off your face. It's...
- Cotton balls.
- Cotton balls.
And they left together.
Is there some probiem?
Did she seem to know him?
Were they talking together?
Did you notice anything else?
I noticed she had wet hair, which is a bit strange.
I didn't really hear what they were saying but...
...he had his arm around her.
- Around her waist or...?
- No, around her shoulder.
What...? What did he iook like, this man?
Tall, well-dressed, mustache, dark skin.
He had an accent.
- An accent?
- Not American, if you know what I mean.
More like Middle East.
- Thank you very much for your help.
- No, no. Dr. Walker. No, no.
I'm sorry. Thank you very much.
I'm sorry, sir.
You'll have to wait your turn.
- But this is an emergency, you understand?
- Yes, sir.
You understand, but don't give a damn, is that it?
I'm sorry, sir. We have a iot of emergencies.
You have to wait like everyone else.
Has everyone eise had their wife kidnapped?
I don't know, sir.
Where you from, sir?
San Francisco, just like it says on the passport.
Can you step through the metai detector, please?
Here, I'il take that, sir.
[METAL DETECTOR BUZZES]
Wanna step back through and remove all the metal objects from your pockets.

- I keep your passport.
- Thank you.
You're supposed to wear this pass in the building, sir.
Thank you. Go in.
[DOOR BUZZES]
Eyes?
Blue, both of them.
Blue.
- Face?
- Oval. Look...
I know this must seem like annoying bureaucracy, but really...
...we have to get one of these to the police when we deal with a missing person.
I've already been to the police.
I filled out one of these damn forms.
And it's not a missing person.
It's a kidnapping.
Don't you think that's a bit premature to be so positive?
No, I don't think. I have witnesses.
My wife was kidnapped.
- Do you understand what I'm saying to you?
- Yes. Yes, of course.
But what would you like us to do, exactly?
I want you to find my wife.
Well, you understand, Dr. Walker, ours is basicaliy a liaison function.
We can assist you in communicating with the French police.
We can put pressure on the Ministry of Interior. But this is their country.
It's their jurisdiction.
We can't just send a posse out after her.
What do you do here?
I'm head of American Services.
Visa applications...

- Is there somebody here who can help me?
Why don't you have a word with our security officer?
- Are you rich?
- No. Well, I'm well-off. I'm a surgeon.
- You involved in politics?
- No.
What about your wife?
The same.
We don't even vote anymore, I'm afraid.
There doesn't seem to be much to support your kidnapping theory.
This is your only evidence?
She could have just dropped it.
It's a bit flimsy, doesn't close very well.
It used to.
You were in the shower when this person calied?
Yes.
So you didn't actually hear any of their conversation?
No, none of it.
They spoke for a moment and then she went downstairs to meet him.
Meet him?
Yes, meet him.
And when they left the hotel, he had his arm around her.
- Dr. Walker.
- He had his arm around her.
Here, like this.
He could have had a gun. Like this.
Here. Pointed right at her.
"Shut up. Smile. Walk. Out the lobby."
Like this, huh?
Yes. Yes, it couid mean that. Or they could've just been having a good time.

Ha-ha-ha. Let me introduce you.
Dr. Alloullou, Dr. Bouzid, Professor Cherif.
Best surgeon in Tunisia.
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.
- What happened?
Did you have some trouble or did you have too much champagne like us? Ha-ha.
- We dance?
- Yes.
I see.
[SPEAKS IN FRENCH THEN CHUCKLES]
[GRACE JONES' "I'VE SEEN THAT FACE
BEFORE" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
We take American Express.
I've got something else too.
- Where is he?
- Dead.
Those Israeii dogs.
It's most regretted you were followed.
It's more likely you were followed.
We still have your wife, doctor.
And I still have what you want.
Then I propose another exchange.
And this time,
I decide how it's gonna be done.
- You'il hear from me.
- Very well.
- So everybody is in your hands, doctor.
- That's right.
MAN [OVER PHONE]: Yes?
RICHARD: Are you ready?
Yes.
Five a.m.
On the bridge by the Statue of Liberty.
I understand.
[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
You broke your word.
You were to keep me with you.
I'm sorry. It's dangerous.
I don't need your money, Waiker.
It's cold.
MAN:
Hold it there!
Let's see it.
Give it to the girl.
- She comes alone.
- My wife first!
[SOBS]
Give me my money or I'll throw your fucking thing in the river.
- Money? What money?
- I still wasn't paid.
I don't have any money.
Oh, really?
Hold it there!
- How much?
- Ten thousand francs.
- Quick.
- All right.
[SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
MAN:
Stop!
[SHOUTING IN FRENCH]
[GUNSHOTS]
No.
[GRUNTING]
RICHARD:
Go!
MAN: Ah!
RICHARD: Just go!
Ah!
[GUNSHOTS]
[SPEAKING IN FRENCH]
- I'm cold, Walker.
- You'il be fine, baby. You'll be fine.
You'll be all right.
Oh.
[SPEAKING IN FRENCH]
This? This is what you want?
I love you, baby.
[SNIFFLING]
I love you.
[ENGLISH SDH]
-Did you get soaked, Ginny?
-Begin, Mr Cope.
-Of course l didn't.
-Very well.
Don't worry about me. ln this will your late husband left you a life interest in his entire estate.
After your death it is to be distributed equally among the children.
As you know, Elmer relied upon you to look after them.
No more than my duty when l became their stepmother.
However, Mrs Boynton, there is a second will.
Second will?
Signed two days before he died.
This is the last will and testament of Elmer D. Boynton... of Milk House, Spiddletown, New Jersey--
Just the meat and potatoes, Mr Cope.
The estate is to be divided equally.
You and the children receiving approximately...
$200,000 each. l don't believe it.
Bring that here. l want to see that for myself.
Elmer knew the children were not fit to take control of their own affairs.
He must have changed his mind.
Elmer changed his mind only under my direction. lt's perfectly valid, Mrs Boynton.
Shall we read the will?
Have you ever done a discreditable act,
Mr Cope?
Not professionally, l hope.
The affair of the Bolivian silver-mining corporation slipped your memory? l'm not sure what you're-- lt used to be called share pushing, Mr Cope. lf it were to come to the attention of the United States Law Society... you'd be instantly disbarred and probably go to prison as well.
How did you know about that? l did not serve in the prison service 1 4 years for nothing.
People trusted me with their little secrets.
Your partner, for example.
She went inside, didn't she?
She told me all about you, and l can prove it.
Well, Mrs Boynton, l was"...." l was young, ambitious.
This room has gotten a little chilly.
Why not get a nice cheerful blaze going?
Go ahead.
A wise decision, Mr Cope.
Now we'll call the others.
Bring in the children.
''My dearest children, Lennox...
''Carol...
''Raymond...
''and Ginevra...
''l leave in the good and loving hands of Emily Boynton.
''And to my wife, Emily Boynton, l leave a life interest in my estate.
''On her death l leave it shared equally...
''among my aforementioned and beloved children.''
-No!
-Jesus Christ! What"...." lmpossible! l don't believe it!
And now, children, l have a lovely surprise.
Another one, Stepmother?
My three stepchildren, whom l love as l do my own daughter Ginevra... and you, Nadine, my dear daughter-in-law... l've arranged for us all to go to Europe and the Holy Land. lt will clear the air of death.
-Does that include Mr Cope?
-Certainly not.
Mr Cope has work to do here.
Smile.
Attagirl!
Come on.
Like that.
That's pretty.
Oh, my.
Just as l thought.
That will look great.
Nadine, please, my medicine.
Quickly, please.
Yes, Mother.
Someone should be with Mother. l'd like to push her over.
You really think there was another will? l know there is. Father told me.
Daddy said l was to have $200,000 all to myself.
You see?
What's the point of knowing about it if we can't do anything about it?
Oh, my dear"...."
She's all right. Some girl's gone to help her.
So l see.
Can l help you? l am a doctor, well, just.
Just?
Nadine, over here quickly.
When l get back l'm going to have it out with Cope.
You can do it now.
-Don't be silly, Ginny.
-Look, he's here over by the car.
Let me see.
She's right. He's there.
Cope's here, Mother. Did you ask him?
Of course he's not here.
Here, give a lira to that girl for her help.
-He's not really here, is he?
-Sure he is, by the terrace café.
Nadine, where are you going?
Excuse me.
My mother asked me to give you this. l can afford to buy my own cup of coffee, thank you. l helped your mother because l'm a doctor.
You are?
Yes, l've just graduated. l'm sure you did.
Excuse me.
What is the point in authorising a guide... if, as you say, Miss Quinton, he gets his facts wrong? lt's easy to make a mistake about dates, Lady Westholme.
Confusing Romanesque and Gothic is not a mistake. lt is ignorance.
What's the matter, Miss Quinton? l seem to have lost my cigarette case.
That man masquerading as a guide probably stole it.
Where is he?
Officer. l want that man arrested. l am Lady Westholme, a member of the British ''Parliamentos''.
That man there is a thief.
You must arrest him.
Officer, l told you. You must arrest him.
Oh, dear.
Hi.
-l told you not to come.
-l had to.
My husband tells me there's another will. ls that so, Jefferson?
Nadine, darling, l'm your mother's attorney. l can't divulge that.
You think if there's no money for him, l'll be forced to leave Lennox and come with you. l think you'll come anyway.
Well, now what if Lennox sees that?
When can l use it with that inscription?
Whenever you want.
You want him to find out, don't you?
MademoiseIIe.
Poirot.
-Hercule Poirot.
-Yes.
Thank you.
What are you doing in Trieste? l'm taking a well-earned vacation, Miss King.
Or is it already Doctor? lt's Doctor. l graduated with honours.
Probably passed it on to an accomplice by now.
Oh, dear. l have heard you enough for the rest of my life.
Lady Westholme is always arguing with somebody.
Lady Westholme?
But she sounds American.
Well, her name was Laura Vansittart.
She met Lord Westholme on a boat trip back from America.
You know, within a month they were married... and 10 years later she's a member of our Parliament.
Which shows the danger of ocean travel.
This will be good fun.
Go away, Ray.
Look who l found.
Get up with me, Nadine.
Lennox, you take Ray and Carol and walk.
We're going back to the ship.
Yes, Mother.
Lennox.
Good morning, Emily. l decided to join you.
You should be in America, Jefferson, sorting out the family's affairs.
Yes, well, l thought l might sort affairs out here.
Driver. To the port.
You know that young man?
His mother nearly became my first client.
Look here. l've found it. l've got a deep and awful fear that those ladies are going to be on the ship with us.
Lennox, Nadine, come along.
Mrs Boynton.
What have you got there? lt's a duck.
Oh, God. lt's a dead duck.
Good evening.
Miss Quinton, l thought we'd lost you.
-A friend of mine from England.
-No, thank you.
-May l have some barley water?
-Seems a very nice person.
Miss Quinton has to be careful.
She is to take charge of the excavations at Qumran.
Hercule Poirot?
The Belgian?
He's missing an excellent Meursault.
Ray, will you dance with me?
You're tired, Ginevra. Better go to bed. l'm not tired, Mother. Come on, Ray.
-lt's 9:00. You go to bed, young lady.
-l won't.
Come on, Ginny. l'll go with you.
Sit down, Nadine.
The child prefers to go by herself.
Yes, l'd rather go alone. Thank you, Nadine.
Mrs Boynton, would you care to dance?
You don't mind, do you, Lennox, if l take your wife for a spin?
-He's very daring.
-l'll say. He's got a lot of nerve.
You may call me Nadine if you like.
Okey-dokey, Nadine.
When we get to Jaffa why don't we just disappear... you and me together?
Why, Mr Cope, the things you do say.
Young man, look through here.
And this is how you get it to focus.
You understand? You move this.
But not until l tell you.
Ready?
One, two, three.
You took it too soon.
-This is charming.
-Yes, indeed.
Have a good time.
-Sarwazi Swizzle.
"-S"i", signore."
Hello.
-We met in Trieste.
-Yes. You're from England?
We went there. lt rained. lt often does.
What's that?
When we get to Jaffa, let's just disappear.
What do we use for money? l'm not trained for anything.
You're not even a qualified nurse. lt'd be hopeless.
Not as hopeless as living with your mother.
She can't live forever.
She'll live.
Good morning, "Monsieur" Poirot.
How are you feeling today?
You're going to administer the last rites, Doctor? l have some hyoscine syrup.
Here, two drops will cure you.
Four drops will kill me, so count them carefully in that case.
Don't mess with me, Jefferson.
You're having an affair with a married woman... who happens to be my daughter-in-law.
When we get to Jaffa, l suggest you leave us and go back to America.
They know about the will, Emily.
Elmer told Lennox, and he told Ginevra.
Why don't you give them some money?
Let them enjoy it while they're still young? l spent 1 4 years in prison, Jefferson.
As a matron. lt was still prison. l'm used to prison.
You're not.
Elmer never made a second will.
Do you understand? Never.
Stay away from my family. l've done things in my life that l'm not proud of, Emily.
Right now, l must tell you, it surprises even me. l'm ready to do something decent. l want those children of yours to have a chance.
You may be right. l'm sorry that l threatened you, but"...."
Join us tonight for dinner, will you?
Well"...."
One way or another you're one of the family after all.
That's terribly nice of you, Emily.
-lt'll all work out.
-l'm sure it will.
Now just let me get some rest.
See you at dinner.
She fixed the will. We're trapped.
You do see, don't you?
She's got to be killed.
She's not even our mother.
Look what she's doing to us now.
She treats us like we're puppy dogs.
Exactly. Can you think of any other way?
"Monsieur" Poirot, at last you surface to join us at the Captain's table.
Look at them. So garish. l am sometimes ashamed of my fellow countrymen.
Yes, but you are British now,
Lady Westholme. ln fact you are a member of Parliament. ls that not unique? l've been British for 10 years, "monsieur." l consider myself merely a colonial who returned to the fold.
Oh, my dear.
A magnum of Louis Roederer Cristal, 1928.
To celebrate our last night on the ship.
Lennox, darling, l must have left my watch in the cabin.
Be a dear and get it for me, would you?
Of course.
Nadine, how careless of you.
Cope's coming.
-Mother asked him.
-She did?
Good evening, everyone.
-Good evening.
-Good evening, Jefferson.
Ravishing.
Excellent.
No, no, no! Let me. lt's lucky to pour your own wine.
Your glass, Carol.
Hi. Do you loop-de-la?
Loop-de-la?
Jitterbug? l nearly tried that once. l think l fell over.
Jefferson, your glass.
Fell over?
Well, doesn't everyone? lt's such a strange dance.
Well, listen, some of the guys in the band... you know, when the old fogies have gone to bed... they really start to boogie.
Here, around midnight, would you? l'd be most interested in boogying with you,
Mr Boynton.
Great.
Jefferson.
Thank you.
See you later.
Ray, your glass.
Careful, it's very full.
-There you are, my dear.
-Thank you.
Do you think we'll get much time?
Lennox not back?
-He won't be a minute.
-Never mind.
Get up.
To us all, the family and our dear lawyer.
Health and happiness.
You bastard! l knew no good would come from him being here.
Good God!
He's such a nice young man usually.
Oh, no.
''To my dearest Nadine, may we always be together.''
Lennox shouldn't have hit him. lt's no way for a gentleman to behave. lt was just a figure of speech.
Get him"...." Get him away from me.
Off.
All right, let's settle it down. Take it easy.
Did you see him? He's a mad man.
These Americans, scandalous behaviour.
What next, l wonder?
Next, madam, we arrive in the Holy Land.
Come along, Dr King. l've arranged a little priority for us.
-Priority?
"-Baksheesh" is the word.
Poirot.
Poirot, good to see you, old fellow.
Yes, Colonel Carbury.
May l present Dr King?
This is Colonel Carbury.
He's an old friend of mine... and he is responsible for keeping the peace in this Holy Land.
Colonel.
Colonel, are you here to meet me? l am Lady Westholme, a member of His Majesty's government.
Your Ladyship, the Governor's representative, Mr Bickerstaff, is over there.
-Where have you been?
-Good morning, Lady Westholme.
Are you staying at the American Colony,
Miss King?
-We are on the same tour.
-Well, let me take you there.
Thank you.
Poirot and l are old friends.
We were together in lndia. ln Burma, l believe it was.
What on earth has brought you out here, old chap?
Oh, l don't know.
A nose for murder, perhaps.
Murder? Where?
Oh, no, it hasn't happened yet. l hope it doesn't happen.
Quite enough to keep us busy here already.
This vehicle is disgusting.
We have you down for six days in Jerusalem, Mr Cope... and then Qumran for another four.
Qumran is particularly interesting. lt's on the Dead Sea.
Excuse me. l'll wait for you here, sir.
Miss Quinton, isn't it?
Oh, you were the young man who was involved in the incident last night.
How nice of you to call me young.
Where are you going in Palestine?
To Qumran. l'm an archaeologist. l love digging. l'm a lawyer. l like digging, too.
-How long have you been an archaeologist?
-About 10 years. l'll deal with this, Nadine. Jefferson.
Would you excuse me? l think it best, Jefferson, if you distanced yourself from us for a while.
As a matter of fact, Emily, l have only just made arrangements to forego Jerusalem. l will be going directly to Qumran to dig.
Digging too much can be dangerous.
Jerusalem was the capital of Judea and Samaria.
The Jewish people had a state here in Biblical times.
Yes, now they flock in from every country in Europe.
Makes a lot of trouble for us, l can tell you.
Well, l thought that man, Weizmann, put it rather well the other day... before Lord Peel's commission here in Jerusalem.
''There are six million Jews in Europe,'' he said...
''for whom the world is divided into two parts.
''Places in which they are not allowed to live and places they cannot enter.'' lt will have to be solved.
Do you want to go out tonight, Poirot?
Give me one good night on "terra firma." l'll do anything you want tomorrow.
-Well, let me see you in then.
-Oh, yes. Thank you. lsn't that the girl from the ship?
Smile.
Lennox, if Daddy had intended to leave me a lot of money... wouldn't he have told Mr Cope about it?
And why did Mr Cope disappear? l haven't seen him since yesterday.
They turned me out because l have on a sleeveless dress.
Apparently, the Almighty doesn't like my arms... in spite of having made them.
Sleeves are holy.
So picturesque. l just love it.
Young man, press that. Not yet.
Lady Westholme.
This is the men's section.
You are not allowed.
Press the button. Press the button.
This is the back of the
Holy Sepulchre Church, you understand.
Mind the steps.
Wait now. Don't all rush.
Raymond, come here! ls all well, "madame?"
What are my sufferings compared to those of our Redeemer?
Of course. l thought since my friend there is a doctor"...."
Hi, can l see you tonight after dinner?
Oh, l"...."
The Café El Arish. lt's in the square behind the hotel.
-Right.
-Raymond.
Now where are Nadine and Lennox?
Smile.
Come on. You're not still sulking over Jefferson, are you? lt's a good one. l love you, Lennox. You know that. l want our marriage to work.
Nadine! Lennox!
But it won't unless we can get away from your mother.
Come here!
We have so much to see.
Goodbye, "Monsieur" Poirot.
Goodbye, "madame."
Come along, children.
-Mother, can l go swimming?
-Swimming is dangerous, Ginevra.
May we go to the Dead Sea? l hear it's full of salt.
The proud mother hen with her chicks.
She's a monster.
Are you getting emotionally involved, dear Doctor?
Come.
Dr King.
Hi, l'm Carol Boynton. l have a message for you from Raymond. l had a feeling he might not turn up.
He wanted to, but he wasn't feeling well.
My stepmother went on at him.
About me?
Before her marriage, our stepmother was a wardress in a prison.
My father was the governor, and he married her.
And she's still a wardress to us.
How old are you?
Twenty-two. Ray's a year older than l am.
Why don't you leave home?
We wouldn't know where to go or what to do.
No one outside can really understand. l think l understand quite well.
Please, Ray is very sorry.
He really would like to meet you.
You're back early, Dr King. Why don't you join Colonel Carbury and myself?
-l could do with a drink, thank you.
-Yes.
Sit down here. l'll order for you.
What would you like?
This is an awful lot of money.
You'd better do the job properly.
Are you sure this is the normal fee for the work? l thought you ought to see this, sir.
Oh, Lord!
Something serious?
Some American's disappeared from Qumran.
Qumran? lsn't that by the Dead Sea?
This American, do we have anything on him?
His name is--
Jefferson Cope.
How on earth did you know that?
Ascribe it to the little grey cells. l have some slight knowledge of the fellow.
Perhaps l could help?
Would you?
Will you be going out today, sir?
-Good morning, Hercule.
-Bonjour, docteur.
Mother, please. l'm not a child anymore.
That voice.
Go upstairs, Ray, darling, and get my digitalis. l don't feel very well.
Will you be going out, then?
Mrs Boynton... you have tried to prevent your son and daughter from making friends with me.
Well, it's just pathetic and rather ludicrous.
Why be an ogre?
You could be kind if you tried. l never forget. Remember that. l never forget anything... not an action... not a name... not a face.
Dr King. l believe you, too, are going by car to Qumran?
Yes. l've already complained about the first one our tour company sent. l am insisting on decent transport.
Perhaps you will accord me the pleasure of coming to Qumran with me?
Colonel Carbury has placed a car at my disposal.
"Monsieur" Poirot, did l hear you say you had a car available? l shall be going with "Monsieur" Poirot.
-Be sure l get a complete rebate.
-l'll do my very best for you, madam.
A most gracious gesture. l think so, yes. All right, let's go to Qumran. l'm so looking forward to this.
The desert, the sand, local animals. l do hope l've brought enough film for my camera. l have so much l want to record.
Thank you. l'm Hercule Poirot.
The Hercule Poirot?
-My name's Healey, sir.
-Oh, yes.
We work along the same lines... putting together a case from little scraps of evidence that don't seem to make sense.
And what news of Mr Cope?
Not a thing, l'm afraid.
And there's more bad news.
Miss Quinton has vanished, too.
Miss Quinton and Mr Cope? l can't believe it.
What are those people doing?
Why, they're digging, Mrs--
Lady Westholme.
Why are they digging when they should be searching for Miss Quinton?
Sarah King.
Here. Here. Here. l wish you all would please listen to me.
We have a lady missing.
-There's so much coming and going.
-l want you to stop your digging now.
Visitors and archaeologists and other excavations. lt was only today we realised that Miss Quinton had gone.
She's very small, very petite.
Why don't you all pay attention?
-Did they both go together?
-Well"...."
Hello, lady. Look, l found something.
For the cigarette.
And what do you think of that?
Think of what, "madame?" What is it?
Miss Quinton's cigarette case.
She's always losing it. lt is a vital clue to her whereabouts.
What is that?
Horsemen. Quite a lot of them.
Well, maybe it's their abductors. l think the truth is probably more prosaic than that. lt usually is you know, Dr King, despite appearances.
Goodness me, there she is.
How immensely theatrical. l hoped to see something like this.
Remind me not to do this again.
Miss Quinton, you've caused much anxiety.
Oh, really? Oh, dear.
Well, we were only in the next valley.
-You were?
-We enjoyed an Arabian night in the desert. lt was great fun. l can imagine it was.
"Shucran." Thank you very much.
See you again, l hope.
Well, we rejoice that the lambs that were lost have returned to the fold.
Now that that has been established, could we have some lunch, Mr Healey?
That's the most sensible thing you've said all morning.
There's no need for that noise, madam.
This is not New York. lt is a site of history.
Why, that woman is of the commonest type, gross and offensive.
Lunch is served a little further up the hill.
Look at that.
The Arabs have a nose for who tips the most.
Afternoon. l've been thinking about you. l know it seems odd after such a short acquaintance... but l think l'm in love with you.
Well, if you are, you'd better learn to stand up for yourself a little.
Behave like a man. Don't you think? lt's never as true as it is about food in this region. lt looks like lamb.
A very nice meal, wasn't it, children?
Considering it was prepared by foreigners.
Poirot!
-ls that"...."
-Poirot!
Since there is no mystery for me to solve...
Colonel Carbury has persuaded me to visit the town of Acre with him.
Well, l shall just have to manage without you, "Monsieur" Poirot.
You will do it all too well.
Small ones in the front, tall ones in the back. That's it. l'm coming, Carbury. Excuse me. l must hurry. l'm sorry. l'll bet you are.
Good-bye. l think you should all take a little walk. lt will do you good to get away from me for a little while.
Smile.
-Say ''cheese''.
-Cheese!
Lennox will settle me in my chair outside my tent... and, Nadine, you'll see that l have my medicine. l don't want to go to bed.
Why should l go to bed? l'm not going to.
Ginevra, go to your tent. l'm not tired.
-Of course you are, go to rest at once.
-All right.
-Raymond.
-Yes, ma'am.
Why don't you ask Dr King if she'd like to join you on your walk?
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
And while you're there... ask Lady Westholme if she could spare me a moment while you're all gone.
Jefferson, Mother suggested we go for a walk.
You know Qumran.
Where do you think we should go?
Well... back in the hills. lt's quite lovely. l've been there before.
-l bet you have.
-Would you like me to take you?
-Mother.
-Come now. Let's all be friends.
This is too confined a spot for tribulation.
Excuse me. l was wondering, Dr King, if you'd care to accompany us on our walk? l should like that very much. l do not believe in exercise after lunch. l think l'll go to my tent and work.
My stepmother would like a word with you later, Lady Westholme.
She would?
Shall we go?
So do l. l thought we were all going for a walk. l have permission to go with Miss Quinton.
She's going to explain the diggings to me.
-Well, have fun.
-Thanks.
Bye.
They've found some bronzes with very odd markings on them.
All ready? Off you go, then. l guess it must be very different from England, Miss King.
Of course it's different.
-l've had enough.
-What's up, Lennox? l'm going down.
Aren't you feeling well?
There he goes.
Well, what's the old saying?
You shouldn't join if you can't take a joke.
Don't you think we should go down with him?
You said l should behave like a man. l'm going back now.
No, on my own.
There's something l have to say and do to prove to you that--
You don't have to prove anything to me, Raymond.
To myself then.
-Where is everyone?
-They've gone down below, haven't they?
They've gone to see what was found today at the digging.
No. No. No, please. Will you please"...."
Thank you, Carbury. l don't know l'm sure whether we should partition Palestine or not.
Maybe we should have left it to the Turks. l never studied all that. l was too busy with my medical curriculum. lt's a pity.
You learn so much about a place, but only if one has prepared. ln my view the British--
Excuse me, Lady Westholme.
-Let me. l'm a doctor.
-She no answer, lady.
Let me do it, Ginny. Let me do it.
-Excuse me.
-Let me see.
What does she want? l'm afraid l have some bad news.
Mr Boynton, l'm sorry.
Your stepmother is dead.
-Careful, Margaret.
-You've got to take care of her.
There you are. lt's all right. lt's all right.
But l just spoke to her an hour ago. lt's not possible.
What, in your opinion, was the cause of death, Dr King?
Heart failure seems the most likely.
And can you estimate a time of death?
Well, l'm not very experienced at that sort of thing... but l'd say a couple of hours ago at least. l see.
You noticed the marks on the wrist, of course?
No, what kind of marks?
Oh, yes, little pin pricks.
She had a bad heart condition. l'm convinced she died of natural causes.
You know, when someone is hated as much as Mrs Boynton was... a sudden death by natural causes seems a little too convenient.
Do you think you've stumbled on another murder, "Monsieur" Poirot?
Would you oblige me by opening your medical bag?
Yes, of course.
Though, l really don't see what possible--
Someone has been here.
Excuse me.
This bottle of digitalis, was it empty?
No, it was full.
Really, Poirot... are you sure you're not letting your professional instincts run away with you?
Why should l do that, "mon coIoneI?"
Old woman with a heart condition...
-walking, heat.
-Yes--
Yes, l know she had pricks in the arm, a family that hated her.
She could easily have taken an overdose of her own medicine.
No, because it was her habit to take that drug in water... administered by her daughter-in-law.
You mean, she's a suspect?
My dear Colonel, everybody is a suspect.
Well, you're the expert, but what do you want me to do?
That Doctor"...." What's her name?
Dr King thought it was natural causes. l'm convinced that Mrs Boynton was murdered.
Can you show me any evidence? l can do better than that. l can identify the guilty party.
Oh, my dear fellow, l couldn't possibly ask you to do that. l mean, you're on holiday after all. l give you my word of honour.
You mean you'll give us a case that will stick? l don't know that l can do that, but l can tell you who the murderer is.
Well, how long will it take? l can't keep all these people here as suspects forever.
They'll soon run out of day trips to take and insist on going home. l will give you the truth in two days.
Very well. Very well, 48 hours. ln time for the coronation junket at the American Colony.
You seem very certain. l am very certain because, you see, people like to talk... and in talking they tell the truth.
Why? lt puts much less of a strain on the memory.
Oh, but, of course you have to have the genius to listen.
Thank you very much.
Dr King.
Very pretty, miss, for you special price.
Twenty dinars.
Offer him five.
But, sir"...."
Tea time. Come along.
Five dinars. l give in.
You still think someone killed her with an injection?
Someone? You had as good a motive as anyone.
Me?
Well, you called Mrs Boynton an ogre, did you not, back at the hotel? l criticised her behaviour.
And how did she respond to that?
Well, all she said was"...." l never forget anything... not an action... not a name... not a face.
Then you fell in love with Raymond Boynton.
Of course his stepmother could never allow such a marriage. ln any case he could never leave home of his own accord.
That's rubbish. He'd already made up his mind to do exactly that.
You had discussed it with him?
Yes.
Earlier yesterday afternoon?
Yes, as a matter of fact.
Dr King, could you tell me exactly what happened yesterday after lunch... when l was no longer there?
Well, as you know...
-we were all going off for a walk.
-Yes. lt must've been about 3:15 when we left the camp.
Nadine was fIirting dreadfuIIy with Mr Cope.
Lennox was suIking, and then suddenIy he said.... l'm going down.
And what time was it?
-About quarter to 4:00.
-And then?
I stayed and taIked to Raymond.
He said he was going back.
He said he had to prove something.
There's something l have to say and do"...."
It was 5..00, I'd say.
Perhaps he decided to murder his stepmother.
Raymond's incapable of such a thing.
Excuse me, l heard him plot exactly such a thing with his sister Carol. l heard them by chance, aboard ship.
How is it you're always in the right place to hear threats and plots, "Monsieur" Poirot?
Put it down to a gift, if you will.
When did you return to the camp?
About 6..00.
I saw Mrs Boynton. The Arab was having troubIe waking her for dinner.
You were arriving then yourseIf.
And you insist that Mrs Boynton had been dead for two hours? l do. ln other words, when Raymond came down, he said he spoke to his stepmother.
He must have been speaking to a corpse? l thought, "Monsieur" Poirot, we were friends.
We were while l was still on holiday... but now l have been empowered by His Majesty's representative... to conduct an inquiry.
All suspects are equal.
And you really believe, "monsieur," that l am a suspect?
Why not? lt would be very easy for you to go to your tent.
On the way back you stop briefly at Mrs Boynton... and you give her her fatal dose.
After all, you're a doctor.
And to put the clock back two hours would protect both you and dear Raymond.
That is the most--
Dr King, l suspect... that your butterfly's on upside down.
Hercule Poirot.
Thank you. lt was quite extraordinary really, l--
Enter.
May l present "Monsieur" Poirot, Lord Peel.
A distinct honour. l extended my morning break, when l heard you were coming, "Monsieur" Poirot.
Lord Peel heads a Royal Commission.
On his judgement alone rests the fate of Palestine.
A task for Solomon.
The Arabs wouldn't think so.
Excuse me, "Monsieur" Poirot,
Lady Westholme, Miss Quinton.
Delegations await me. l hope they're not getting too impatient.
Lady Westholme, l badly need your help.
Fire away.
Miss Quinton and l will do our best.
When it comes to matters of public duty, one must be punctilious.
As my dear father used to say,
''When the stern call of duty comes''--
What is it you want to know?
Well"...." No, thank you very much. l'm particularly interested in the period yesterday after we finished lunch.
You did not immediately go for your walk, l believe.
Knowing l was to meet Lord Peel today... l attempted to study my papers on the history of Palestine.
I was asked to have a conversation with Mrs Boynton.
-And you went?
-lndeed.
Pardon my"...." What did you talk about?
She started to attack me...
because the British do not want
Mrs Simpson to marry their King.
It must be the onIy subject on which she and I couId possibIy agree...
but she wouId not Iisten to me.
And then?
Having failed to ruffle my feathers... she picked an argument with one of the Arabs.
She seemed very annoyed with him.
Having servants about who cannot speak a word of EngIish is very trying.
Could you identify this man? l couldn't see his face. l had returned to my tent... but l can tell you he was of more than average height.
He wore the usual native headdress. ln addition, he had on a pair of torn and patched breeches... and his puttees were wound most untidily.
And after that you went for your walk?
No, l waited for Miss Quinton to return and suggested that we ask Mrs Boynton... if she wanted anything before we left the camp. That would've been about"...."
We're going for a walk, Mrs Boynton. ls there anything we can do for you?
She grunted like a pig.
Most offensive.
Quite obviously, she drinks.
Come along, Miss Quinton.
She's not the sort of person we should talk to.
And when you came back?
We didn't talk to Mrs Boynton again. l returned to my work.
And l went down to the huts below... to see if anything significant had been unearthed that day.
Telephone for you, Lady Westholme. lt is Lord Westholme from England.
-May l?
-Madame. l hope the line is clearer than it was"...."
A providential phone call.
Did you actually see
Mrs Boynton speak to an Arab boy? l did see someone in white approach her.
The sun was in my eyes, but I thought it might be--
It might be?
The sheik who brought us back.
But, of course, it wasn't.
No. And then? l went back to Carol Boynton.
Well, it's been most informative.
Thank you so much. Yes.
-There was something else.
-Oh?
But l can't remember what it was.
Well, when you think of it, don't hesitate to tell me.
Oh, Mr Cope and l are to go to Petra.
Petra? The rose-red city half as old as time.
Roses. That's it.
Something to do with roses?
Roses, greenfly, spray, syringe!
Syringe?
While l was walking back down...
I saw this IittIe box.
I picked it up, and inside was one of those hypodermic things.
To whom did it belong? lt was Carol Boynton's.
She thanked me for finding it and took it with her... when she went to fetch Ginevra.
Colonel Carbury phoned.
He asked us all to stay in Jerusalem.
Only for a day or two, "madame."
For what?
You can't seriously suggest that l murdered that ludicrous Boynton woman? l'm terribly sorry, but once my investigation is under way, it's--
"Monsieur" Poirot, l'm deeply disappointed in you.
Come along, Miss Quinton. l'm so sorry.
The British aristocracy's well-known for its bad manners.
They call it eccentricity.
Oh, l'm quite used to it.
-Bottoms up.
-Cheers.
He's coming over.
Colonel Carbury said you wanted to see us. l'm investigating your mother-in-law's death. lt doesn't need investigating.
She died quite naturally. l think not. lf l might have a few moments with your husband? l've a good mind to call our consul.
Oh, that's your right. l mean, if you object to my--
We don't. l'll wait in the lobby.
Thank you very much.
Well, you have your freedom at last.
Freedom?
Well, at least you've managed to save your marriage.
You go too far, "Monsieur" Poirot. l'll speak of that day.
Tell me about it.
When you returned from your walk that afternoon, you were alone?
That's right.
And at what time did you reach the tents?
Soon after 4:00. l looked in on Ginny.
She was asleep.
And what exactly did you say to your stepmother?
She said l hadn't been gone very long...
and I said how hot it was.
That's all?
No, she"...."
She asked me what time it was, since her watch had stopped.
I took it off her, wound it up, and set it to the correct time.
Which was?
Just a quarter after 4..00.
And then?
Then I asked her if there was anything she wanted.
She said no. She was rather tired.
Soon after that l left her to join Carol and Ginny at the excavations.
And she told you of no annoyance caused by an Arab boy?
No. No, she didn't.
No, you saw no one of that description then.
An Arab boy?
-Not a soul. Except down below, of course.
-Yes, of course.
Well, thank you very much indeed,
Mr Boynton. lf l may have a few moments of your wife's time.
Why do you think Mrs Boynton was murdered, "Monsieur" Poirot?
Well, from all l've heard... it's difficult to understand why she wasn't murdered before. l don't regret her death, but l do feel responsible.
My married life has not been particularly happy, "Monsieur" Poirot. l came to the Boynton house a poor girl... hoping to pay for the rest of my nurse's training by taking care of the old lady.
Then l fell in love with Lennox.
Mrs Boynton's condition for letting us marry... was that we both continue to stay living with her. l assumed that this would only be temporary... but l underestimated her hold on my husband.
So in the end l came to a decision.
When did you come to this decision?
On the afternoon of my mother-in-law's death. l have to tell Emily, darling. l decided to leave Lennox for an old flame, Jefferson Cope.
Oh, a flame perhaps, but hardly an old one.
What happened? l returned to the camp about 10 minutes after Lennox.
About 4:30?
I decided to teII her there and then.
Oh, before you toId your husband?
How did she react?
She took it very badly. l refused to listen to her insults and left to join the others.
Do you think it was the shock of your decision which killed her?
But when did you tell your husband?
My husband and I taIked down at the huts.
"Madame," do you by any chance own a hypodermic syringe? l carry one in my medicine chest, but l didn't take it to Qumran.
Mrs Boynton was taking a medicine called digitalis? l usually gave it to her in water.
And if she had taken an overdose"...."
Well, it would've killed her certainly, but she was always very careful, and so was l.
You don't think there's any chance the chemist who was making it up might've-- lt's highly unlikely, "Monsieur" Poirot.
Well, l suppose the analysis will tell us all.
No, unfortunately the bottle containing her medicine... was broken when we brought her back. l did not kill my mother-in-law,
"Monsieur" Poirot.
She was alive and well when l left her.
We've all suffered for so long.
What good does it do to bring ruin and misery to the lives of innocent people?
But who are these innocent people?
At least one of you is very guilty indeed.
Good day, "madame."
Don't worry, darling.
-Room 21 .
-Certainly, sir.
Mr Cope... l thought that Colonel Carbury's representative... asked you not to leave Jerusalem?
Yes, well"...." l have Colonel Carbury on the line.
Perhaps if you do not care for this accommodation... you could move to British military headquarters?
Rather less comfortable.
Take the gentleman's bags back to his room.
No. No, now that your clothes are on their way back to their cupboard... perhaps we could take a walk?
There's really nothing l can say.
Come, Mr Cope.
You've had a most eventful vacation.
First of all, you almost persuade an attractive young woman... to leave her husband.
Secondly, another young woman falls for your charms.
Thirdly, another one is dead, not inconveniently for you. l enjoyed a long and rewarding association with Emily Boynton and her husband. ln fact, her death came as a double blow to me.
The lady l one day hoped to marry... as a result of her husband's new acquisitions of wealth and freedom... decided to remain with him.
Now what sort of convenience has this tragedy for me?
Mr Cope, Mrs Boynton made you present to the family a will made out in her favour... which was invalidated by another one made out in favour of the children.
You were about to be discovered.
Mrs Boynton's death saved you from scandal.
-Please.
-From disgrace!
Rest assured my only interest is the crime of murder.
When did you return to the camp?
I stayed a few more moments with Nadine.
It was obvious that Dr King and Raymond had no desire for company...
so I started back. l guess l must've got back to the camp at about 5:00.
Shortly after that
Carol Boynton came up for Ginevra.
Which gave you plenty of time to go into Dr King's tent... take the hypodermic syringe and put an end to a long and valued friendship. l've made mistakes in my life,
Mr Poirot, many of them... but l am not a murderer.
Allow me to judge that.
There are so many possibilities. l'm totally baffled.
Well then, "mon cher coIoneI," l wish you to address yourself to the following questions.
The time of death. ls Dr King telling the truth? lf not, why not?
Why did "Madame Boynton" encourage her family to go away?
And why was it Mahmoud who tried to wake Mrs Boynton?
Why did not some member of the family attempt this earlier?
-You want me to question Mahmoud?
-You know the lingo.
And see where he and the other Arabs were at the crucial time? lt may have been one of them who was seen arguing with Mrs Boynton.
Perhaps. l go now to question the last of our little group.
The concierge tells me that they went sightseeing to Bayt Jibrin.
Well, l'll report to you at dinner.
What fun!
Fun?
Everything is always fun for you English.
The sun will never set on your games.
Well, l hope it will always be so.
Although l have my doubts.
Thank you.
What are you doing there, miss?
Hiding from the light of day.
Only the guilty hide. l'm guilty of nothing, "Monsieur" Poirot.
Well, suppose you tell us what happened that afternoon.
After that you can explore the darkness to your heart's content.
Miss Quinton showed me the ivories that they had discovered... and then l went up for Ginevra.
What time did you go up?
About a quarter past 5:00.
Did you talk to your stepmother?
As a matter of fact l did.
She was sitting by her tent, and I said
I was going to get Ginevra, and she said....
Let her sleep. No time asleep is wasted. lt's like money in the bank, a store of health. l got Ginny, and she was chattering to me about a sheik visiting her in her tent.
Now, my stepmother was asIeep when we went by...
and Ginny kept insisting that a sheik had come to take her away.
Yes, of course, that is your story... but you could quite easily have taken your hypodermic syringe... the one Miss Quinton found where you dropped it... and you could've killed Mrs Boynton. l don't know how that got where it did.
Do you really think that l would kill my own mother?
''But she's not even our mother''... you said to your brother Raymond on the boat... when he was determined that she should die.
You heard? l heard every word.
We were mad even to think about it, but we were desperate. lt was intolerable what she was doing to Ginny and to Nadine and Lennox.
And so you killed her.
No, we talked about it, but we didn't do it. ln the morning the whole thing seemed ridiculous... like one of those dramas that you dream up in the dark. l had nothing to do with her death.
You do believe me, don't you, Mr Poirot? l've not said that l don't.
You can come out now, Mr Raymond.
Hello, "Monsieur" Poirot.
So you overheard our conversation just as l overheard your conversation.
Yeah, but we didn't go ahead with that stupid plan to kill our stepmother.
-Non?
-Definitely "non." l was with Miss King.
And then I went down. There was something
I had to teII my mother.
About Dr King and yourself?
Exactly. She was pretty upset. l forbid you to see her again.
Do you hear me?
There was no point in arguing... so l went down below to look at the artefacts.
At what time did you talk to your stepmother?
About 5:30.
5:30, after she was dead. Yes, well"...."
Dr King says that she examined the body at 6:00. lt had been dead for about two hours.
She's wrong.
Don't you think it is possible that you took Dr King's syringe... and injected
Mrs Boynton as you had planned?
After all, this would leave you free to marry Dr King... a rich man. ls that what you suspect?
Was your plan any different?
Oh, yes. That's why l don't understand.
All right. All right. What was your plan? l don't think l'm going to say any more.
Not even to me?
No.
Right.
-Well, good-bye.
-Good-bye.
"Monsieur" Poirot.
"Monsieur" Poirot, come here. l must see you.
Well then, come forward, sir or madam... and let me see you.
Tomorrow at 10:00.
The back door of the hotel at 10:00.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, good evening, Miss Quinton.
Oh, good evening, Mr Poirot.
Are your investigations nearly over?
Well, l must say that"...." Oh, that must be the largest spider l've ever seen.
Look, it's going back to its hole... and a brown one at that.
Did you see the spider, Miss Quinton?
Oh, yes. Spiders do not frighten me. l see so many in the course of my scrapping and digging. Oh. Bye-bye.
We really shouldn't talk to him, my dear.
My dear fellow, l'm sorry if we're a little late.
Mr Rogers here has been writing up the notes... of the talks we had with the Arab boys at Qumran.
Had any of them seen anything?
They saw everything and nothing.
We will discuss these notes later,
mon coIoneI.
-A "creme de cassis, s'iI vous pIaît."
-Whisky and soda.
Certainly, sir.
You're on duty now, Rogers.
You'd better get back to the office.
One moment, Rogers, please.
Would you be kind enough to ask our American friends if they have"...." Hello.
They have any knowledge of that person?
Leave it to me, sir. My connections are tiptop. l was in North America.
-Thank you, Rogers. That'll do. Good night.
-Good night, sir.
Colonel Carbury, may l raise my glass to criminology, the easiest of all sciences.
-Hello, Mr Poirot.
-Oh, my dear. How are you?
-Come on.
-Why can't l talk to him?
One Arab, Mahmoud's assistant, l believe he knew something.
Yes, he's asked to see me in the morning.
He has? Do you know who did it? l'm fairly certain, but l want one final meeting between them all tomorrow.
And we must find a really dramatic location for this encounter. l don't want it to be too late. lt's the coronation dance, you know. l'll need time to change.
Good evening.
You used to be so popular.
This is an outrage.
He commands me to take tea.
At the springs of Sataf.
You mean it's a picnic?
You may be a Colonel, Mr Carbury...
but I am a fuIIy accredited member... of His Majesty's government.
You trifle with me at your peril...
with these siIIy charades.
Murder is not a charade, Your Ladyship. lf you prefer, l can have "Monsieur" Poirot conduct his interview here.
One more day l will put up with this.
After the coronation baII tonight, I go.
Dr King.
See you at the market. l want to apologise for last night. lt was silly ignoring you.
We're all on edge.
You are a formidable inquisitor, you know. lt will all be over today.
At your theatrical tea party?
Couldn't you drop it, Hercule?
So many of us stand a chance of happiness now. l"...." lsn't that Hassan from the camp at Qumran?
Yes, indeed.
We have an important meeting arranged.
Hassan, l'm glad you've come. l was--
Hassan, don't go. l'll fetch him back.
"Monsieur" Poirot, l'm going to the market now.
Hassan! Come back!
Sorry.
Single round. Fire!
You better come with us, miss.
She said she was chasing the boy, and he ran into this street.
The shot came from the side.
A gun was thrown in to lie beside the boy.
She ran up to him, picked it up.
Do you really believe all that?
Dr King was wearing a thin cotton dress.
She had no handbag.
There was nowhere to hide even a small revolver like this one.
Our chaps dusted it for fingerprints.
Only Dr King's were on it.
Well, the Boynton family...
Lady Westholme, Miss Quinton, Mr Cope, all in the area... and all the family vouching for each other as you'd expect.
What do we do?
Release Dr King.
You are free to go. l didn't kill him. lt is now 2:30. There is just time to have you driven back to your hotel and then--
Surely you're not still performing your picnic interview?
Oh, yes.
We are foregathering in Sataf as arranged... for afternoon tea.
Colonel Carbury and l have gone to a great deal of trouble... to arrange this spree... and l am sure you will find it informative, refreshing... and even entertaining. lt's like a scene from a play.
Yes, well, if you wish to present a comedy, you must first set the scene.
And the same is true even if it turns out to be a tragedy.
Ladies and gentlemen.
A complete waste of British military resources.
Colonel Carbury has done me the honour of consulting me.
Why? Why the devil should he bring you into this business? l am often brought in in cases of sudden death.
Mrs Boynton's death gave her family not only financial independence... but also a liberation from a tyranny... which had become well nigh insupportable.
Raymond Boynton had been overheard... discussing the possibility of taking Mrs Boynton's life.
He had fallen in love.
You told me you returned to the camp at 5:30 and spoke to your stepmother.
And yet Dr King informs me that at that time she was no longer alive.
Now l put it to you that you returned to the camp...
you saw your stepmother, and you discovered that she was dead.
Did you teII anybody about this?
No, you did not.
You pretended to taIk to her, and then you waIked away.
Now, why on earth should you do that?
You, who could not possibly have been guilty of her murder... because Mrs Boynton was dead sometime before you returned to the camp.
Your mind went back to that conversation you had had aboard ship... with your sister, Carol.
Had she perhaps carried out your plan, done the deed?
Were you in some way trying to protect her?
That's a damned lie!
Let us consider the case against Carol Boynton.
Admitting that the murder was committed by a lethal injection... we already know that Dr King's syringe had been tampered with... but there was another syringe.
That found by Miss Quinton and claimed by whom?
By none other than Carol Boynton.
What have you to say to that, "mademoiseIIe?" lt wasn't mine.
But you claimed it, did you not?
All right. All right, l believe you.
You claimed the hypodermic because that was the instrument... which you and your coconspirator, your brother Raymond, had selected.
You were afraid that he had killed your stepmother.
You, in your turn, were protecting him.
All right, "Monsieur" Poirot, you win.
How did you conceive your plan, sir? l read it...
in a detective story.
Sticking an empty hypodermic into someone injects an air bubbIe which kiIIs them.
So you just purchased the syringe yourself?
No, l took the one Nadine had.
The thing was, l dropped it before l could use it.
And then, when l found Mother dead... l thought maybe Carol had"...."
Of course, it was incredible... but the shock of finding her dead like that"...."
Thank you, Mr Boynton, you may resume your seat.
Time is pressing on, "Monsieur" Poirot, and l can't see that this is leading anywhere.
Can you, Colonel Carbury?
Better let "Monsieur" Poirot proceed in his own manner, dear lady.
He usually gets there in the end.
Usually? Always.
Who then was responsible for the killing?
Dr King?
Was she eager to free Raymond Boynton from his stepmother's clutches?
No, because when Dr King left the encampment...
Mrs Boynton was still alive.
When Dr King returned,
Mrs Boynton was dead.
This has been proved by an independent medical report.
And what of the youngest of our suspects?
Oh, really, "Monsieur" Poirot. That's not fair. l will not have Ginny be accused of such a thing.
Then what about you? lt was you who acted as a nurse to your mother-in-law.
You were the last member of the family to speak to her... which gave you unique opportunity of plunging the hypodermic into her wrist.
Also, you had a motive.
What motive, for God's sake?
Her love for you, sir.
Yes, she behaved well towards her mother-in-law simply because of you... until she found out that your spirit was broken.
She tried to rouse you, to convince you to break free, but she could not.
And so, she determined on one last desperate gesture... using the old trick of jealousy.
Oh, she was prepared to go further than mere fIirtation.
She threatened to actuaIIy Ieave you.
And if that faiIed, there was onIy one aIternative...
to eIiminate her mother-in-Iaw's infIuence over you... by eliminating her mother-in-law. l killed her.
Why?
How can you ask? l am asking you, sir.
Because of what she had done to us, to our marriage.
Your wife only told you of her decision to leave you... when she joined you down at the excavations after Mrs Boynton was dead.
What does it matter? l knew anyway.
But it matters a great deal, sir.
Look, l strongly advise you to tell the truth.
By God, l will.
When we Ieft the tents,
I knew it was aII up unIess I acted fast.
It dawned on me that if I made one decent gesture, I couId stiII save everything.
What gesture, Mr Boynton?
Same as Raymond's, I guess. l've had enough.
To teII Mother I was getting the heII out. l'm going down.
My idea was to take Nadine away that very night if she'd come with me.
And when you reached the tents?
Wake up, Mother. Nadine and l have--
I started to taIk to her tiII I reaIised she was dead.
I didn't know what to do.
You corrected the time on her watch?
It was Iying there in her Iap.
I just acted mechanicaIIy. It was horribIe.
Then I waIked down to the excavations.
That is the truth, l swear. l believe you, Mr Boynton.
Your explanation is consistent not only with the facts... but also with your psychological condition.
This is all very interesting, indeed touching... but l'm expected for cocktails by Lord Peel in an hour and a half.
You may continue with your exhibition,
"Monsieur" Poirot. l am going.
Of course, Lady Westholme. Of course.
Better not be late for the loyal toast, what?
Look, why don't we all go?
Everyone welcome.
Celebrate George mark Vl... though l suppose l ought to say sorry about your Mrs Simpson. l'm very disappointed. l would have expected an American woman to navigate skilfully onto the throne.
Colonel Carbury, were you asking us all to the coronation ball tonight? l was, Miss Boynton.
Thank you.
Sarah. l don't imagine there'll be much in the way of boogying.
Come on.
Do you know who did it? l have until midnight, Colonel.
You didn't even mention that business this morning with the Arab boy.
Well, that will come later. lt only confirms what l know already.
Yes?
The information you wanted from America, sir.
Has Colonel Carbury seen this?
Seen what, old chap? l say, Poirot, what are you doing with that fellow? l thought you were supposed to be working for me.
Help me with my tie, would you please?
After all it's your coronation. lt worked out well.
The Colonel's the best dancer l've ever met.
Not that you've met a lot, kid.
He's better than you, Ray.
Oh, surely no one's better than Ray.
The Colonel certainly is.
-That's very sweet of you, my dear.
-That was fun.
"Monsieur" Poirot should not dance. Too fat.
Bad for the heart. l'd kind of like to know who did it,
"Monsieur" Poirot.
Oh, does it matter? l think it does. Will you tell us?
What makes you so sure it wasn't one of us?
Well, l want you to consider two facts.
First of all,
Mrs Boynton was taking digitalis... and secondly,
Dr King here was missing a syringe.
Now, quite clearly no member of the family need have taken the risk of injecting it.
All they had to do was to increase the level of the digitalis to a fatal dose.
At worst this could be attributed to a mistake by the chemist who mixed it. lf a syringe was used, it was for a very good reason. lt was that the murderer was not sufficiently intimate with Mrs Boynton... just to enter the tent and to tamper with the medicine.
Of all the suspects so far... the most obvious one is Mr Cope.
You, sir, were guilty of chicanery. l admit that she forced me to burn the real will.
Thank God that little injustice was prolonged only for a few weeks.
We forgive you, Jefferson.
But he tried to cheat us.
Well, goodness, we were plotting to murder her.
Go on, man.
Mrs Boynton took a particular pleasure in preventing her family... from associating with other people.
And yet on the fatal afternoon... she actually insisted that they left and that they enjoy themselves elsewhere.
Why?
Well, you see,
Mrs Boynton had to get rid of the family... because, to use a vulgarity... she had other fish for frying.
What was it you said to her in Jerusalem, Dr King? l called her pathetic and ludicrous.
There you have it. There was Mrs Boynton confronted by herself... owing to the words of an intelligent young woman.
She was full of baffled fury.
And then, suddenly, while she was in this mood... there was a face from the past, somebody she recognised... another victim to fall into her grasp.
Consider her words to Dr King. l never forget anything... not an action... not a name... not a face.
Those words were spoken not to Dr King... but to someone else who was standing behind her.
Let us reconstruct what occurred on that fateful afternoon.
The family went off on its jaunt.
Lady Westholme tells us... that one of the Arab servants picked a quarrel with Mrs Boynton.
You mean that one of those Arab fellows stuck her with a hypodermic?
Both Miss Quinton and Lady Westholme say... they saw the Arab boy emerge from the tent occupied by Ginny... but Dr King's tent was next door. lt might quite easily have been that tent to which they were referring.
Lady Westholme said"...." ln addition, he was wearing a pair of torn and patched breeches... and his puttees were wound most untidily.
But Lady Westholme was sitting at her tent
200 yards away.
She said she didn't see the face.
How couId she possibIy have seen the detaiI of cIothing at such a distance?
There was no Arab who had an argument with Mrs Boynton.
The person who killed Mrs Boynton was the same as the one that stood... behind Dr King in Jerusalem.
Dr King.
And it was the same one who was standing behind me...
when I was waiting for the onIy witness of the murder to meet me.
Oh, it was no coincidence.
Lady WesthoIme's window gave onto the very aIIey...
where the boy had asked me to meet him the night before.
She overheard, but she had no way of finding him before our actuaI meeting.
After that she took to the streets
Iike a hunter... and did not rest until she had killed her quarry.
But just a minute. Miss Quinton said that Mrs Boynton was still alive... when she and Lady Westholme started out on their walk... and she was certainly dead by the time they got back.
Miss Quinton agreed with Lady Westholme.
She grunted like a pig.
Most offensive.
But Miss Quinton is easiIy suggestibIe.
OnIy yesterday in the Iobby, I said....
That is the largest spider l have ever seen.
Oh, yes. Spiders do not frighten me.
There was, of course, no spider... and Mrs Boynton at no time grunted like a pig. l invented the spider.
And as for Mrs Boynton, oh, she was dead.
What happened was that Lady Westholme went back to her tent.
She made herseIf a headdress out of a sheet... and a duster, in this manner here... and some kind of a cord.
Like this.
Then she went into Ginny's tent by mistake, hence the story of the sheik.
She came out and went into the tent of Dr King.
Here she finds the hypodermic and fills it.
Then she goes out...
to where Mrs Boynton is sitting, grabs her wrist, and injects the poison.
She Ieaves her sitting there untiI Miss Quinton returns... when Lady Westholme invites her to go for a walk.
But why should Lady Westholme, of all people, want to murder Mrs Boynton?
Lady Westholme was born an American... but, of course, she became more English than any native.
Mrs Boynton said she never forgot a face.
Consider she was a wardress in a prison... and your adjutant, Colonel, has confirmed my suspicion... in a telephone call to the American police... that Lady Westholme, prior to her marriage, was a criminal... who served a prison sentence in that very same prison.
So Stepmother was going to blackmail
Lady Westholme?
Well, not conventional blackmail.
No, there was no money involved. lt just gave her the opportunity of torturing her victim for a while.
Then she'd enjoy revealing the truth. ln the most spectacular way.
Precisely.
Lady Westholme knew that the days of her influence were numbered... if Mrs Boynton could not be silenced.
Ladies and gentIemen...
if you wouId care to go out to the terrace, the fireworks await you.
Fireworks, we've had them already. l'll see you later.
Do you know what it is to come from nothing?
To climb inch by inch to respectability... to hear acclaim, to have position... to see all that turning to dust?
She's better dead.
The family rejoice.
Should l be the only one to suffer?
Will you arrest me, "Monsieur" Poirot?
That is up to Colonel Carbury, "madame."
Damn you.
Oh, l love that visual opulence.
God bless the King.
Oh, look. The royal crown, can you see it over there?
Yes, how nice and royal. lt gives you confidence, l always think.
Lady Westholme's room.
-Excuse me. Excuse me.
-Come on.
What was that?
What's going on?
She died while cleaning her gun.
What?
Suicide would mean another investigation.
She had trouble enough while alive.
Give her peace in death.
A terrible accident, Lord Peel.
There's nothing more that we could do.
''The tragic death of Lady Westholme occurred in Jerusalem yesterday.''
While cleaning her gun as l deduced.
She was ever a woman who knew her duty.
How British for a woman to take the gentleman's way out.
She was American.
Oh, hello.
Good-bye, Hercule.
Good-bye, Colonel Carbury.
You're going to America with this young man?
Oh, Ray's asked me to stay in America.
Only briefly, of course.
Of course. l'm going digging in America,
"Monsieur" Poirot.
-Good-bye!
-Bye-bye.
-Have a good time.
-Bon voyage!
Good-bye, "Monsieur" Poirot!
Good-bye, Colonel Carbury!
Well, l hope they realise, as André Gide did... that to free oneself is nothing.
The really arduous task is to know what to do with one's freedom.
-Good-bye.
-Good-bye.
-Good-bye.
-Au revoir.
Well, l think they'll be all right.
Los Angeles late at night is much like any big American city late at night.
At 2:00 a.m. People are either making a mess or cleaning it up.
Tonight's my night to do the cleaning up.
My name, most of the time, is Irwin Fletcher.
I write under the name of Jane
Doe. That's the kind of gal I am.
This is a Greek seafood house, part of a very successful chain.
But, believe me, it's not because of the food. from basketball.
List it as codfish.
120,000 from the Gonzalez fight.
That includes 60 from our chain in the Valley.
Twenty from Long Beach.
120 total.
Put that under halibut. from the track.
Scrod.
We already got over two million in scrod this month.
Scrod's making a comeback, all right?
So how are you listing my stake?
Breakage.
$ 75,000 worth of breakage?
We're Greeks! We dance, we break plates, we're clumsy!
Cut the fighting. We gotta be cross town in 30 minutes.
You wanna wash up?
Nah. My wife gets suspicious if I come home and my hands don't smell like fish.
I got it.
You get the lights.
Where's Poppa?
In the back.
Tell him to snap it up. We'll meet him in the car. Phil, I'll drop you off first.
You better.
- Hi.
- What's your name, little lady?
My name? Peggy Lee... Zorba.
Peggy Lee Zorba.
- You're cute!
- Do you mind if I freshen up a little bit?
Splash a little water on my face.
Whatever makes you feel sexy.
Okay.
Just wait outside.
I'll be right out.
What the hell was that?
- Jesus.! If it's a cop, kill him.
- Hi. Mary Poppins!
If it's a reporter, cripple him.
You're never driving again!
I just did what you told me to do.
There's a new thing called brakes.! Will you shut up.!
Good. Brilliant as usual, Fletch.
We'll run it in the next edition.
Great. See you in two weeks.
Uh, Fletch, there's... "Uh, Fletch"?
Frank, I see a double-cross in your eyes.
You promised me a vacation and I'm taking it. Right after the sewer story.
What are you talking about?
You can't do this to me.
I spent eight nights on my knees for you dressed like Dolly Parton at a funeral.
I got felt up. I got dishpan hands and sore knees!
Three guys tried to kill me.
And do you give a crap?
You promised me a vacation!
And you're gonna get a vacation.
As soon as you research and write the sewer system expose. You owe me a vacation!
In July you're gonna have it!
That's two months away.
That's why you're such a great reporter. You know the facts.
By the way, the new computer disallowed your undocumented expenses.
- It'll come out of this week's pay.
- You can't do that.
There's nothing I can do about it. It's amazing. It's all done automatically.
On top of everything else,
I think I'm getting my period.
No wonder I got a fumigation alert. How'd you get in here?
The window was open.
I knocked, and I could swear
I heard you say, "Come in."
You really know how to cover your ass, Gillet.
Although those pants are a huge mistake.
You owe me $4,381 in back alimony.
What? I was married to you?
You're right. I've been foolishly squandering my salary on food and heat.
You have one week to comply with Judge Proctor's orders.
Payment in full.
Otherwise you go to jail.
Wendy doesn't need the money.
I hear she's been... banging some balding, wimpy lawyer who can't get it up.
- May I see that?
- Be my guest.
It's a nice briefcase.
Couldn't guess your weight?
Oh! I'm sorry.
I got it.
Never mind,
I'll take care of it.
Look at this. A note from the Oakwood Potency Clinic.
"Sorry to inform you, our machines cannot process sperm counts as low as yours."
Here we are. What about this? Be careful!
Uh-oh!
I am terribly sorry!
You did that intentionally.
No, I did not. I really didn't.
That was good juice too.
Leave it alone.
Good idea. My mistake. Where are you going with that?
My mess.
I'll clean it up.
- What are you doing?
- What's this?
You are damaging personal property and I'm gonna...
The ink is running.
I didn't expect that.
There we are!
Clean as a whistle.
Thanks for coming by, Marvin.
Expect to hear from my lawyer.
Oh, Gillet, one more thing. Come back here. It's very important.
They're doing a thing now where they make an incision in the scalp, push the hair together.
Or you could try a transplant. Maybe the hair from your ass might make you smarter. Bye.
Betty, how 'bout lunch at the In-N-Out Burger?
I'm not hungry.
Forget the burger. How about just the "in and out"?
Very well.
How about just the "in"?
Ooh!
Fletch, answer your phone.
In-N-Out Burger.
May I take your order please?
Mr. Irwin Fletcher?
This is Amanda Ray Ross. I represented your Aunt Belle Fletcher.
Good ol' Aunt Belle.
How the hell is she?
She's deceased, Mr. Fletcher.
Oh. I guess she could be better.
- You're a hard man to find.
- I was touring with the Stones. What can I do for you?
Didn't you get my message?
No.
I'm the executor of your aunt's will and as such I can inform you... you are the major beneficiary of your aunt's estate, Belle Isle.
What about this expense... $58 for leg waxing? That's bullshit.
Yeah, but feel how smooth they are.
It consists of 80 acres of old plantation property.
Wait a minute. Did you say plantation? Yes, indeed.
She left it to me? According to her will, she did.
- Can I get back to you?
- Hair by Ziggy? Who's Ziggy?
5-0-4... Shut up, Frank. Yeah.
I'll get right back to you.
Can't we just return some of these things? What about the lingerie?
- I ate it.
- Be serious for one minute.
I quit.
I'm not unreasonable about legitimate expenses. I quit, Frank.
Yeah. On the sewer story, I'm gonna advance you for the hip boots and wet suit.
Frank, I'm really quitting.
Fletch, look, I got a little
A-frame up at Arrowhead.
Why don't you go there, take a couple of weeks, relax?
I'm really gonna miss you.
Maybe that's an overstatement.
Treat this as good news. You can always write my Jane Doe column.
You're not gonna quit, and I'll tell you why.
Why? You have journalistic integrity.
Yeah. And you have a sense of loyalty.
And you'll never give up the quest for truth, will you?
You're right. I can't abandon the principles that nurtured me lo these many years.
Wrap them up with the shit on my desk and have them shipped to my mansion in Louisiana.
Bye.
What happened?
And my husband said I was crazy to go 2,000 miles to have my nose done.
That's an interesting watch.
Is it a prize of some sort?
No. It certainly looks like one.
It's a championship
Laker watch.
Oh! Are you a Laker?
I used to date one. Only thing
I have to remember him by.
Lord, what was that?
We just clipped a Piper Cub. The pilot's okay. I just saw him parachuting.
I love a man with a sense of humor.
What did you say your name was?
Nostradamus.
I'm Cindy Mae Sample.
Nostradamus.
I love the Fightin' Irish.
Lord, I hate to fly. I wish I was gettin' off in Thibodaux like you.
It's two more stops to Selma. All those ups and downs and ups and downs.
You should try holding your breath.
Sometimes that works.

You made it,
Mr. Notre Dame.
Mr. Fletcher.
I'm Amanda Ray Ross.
I spoke with you on the phone. Oh, yes. That was you?
Great.
Do you have any luggage?
Just one piece.
Plannin' on stayin' long?
Just long enough to see Mount Rushmore and squeeze in a little ice fishing.
I'm on the board of the Pontchartrain Society.
We help preserve and restore some of these lovely mansions.
We headed to Belle Isle?
- You must be dying to see it, Mr. Fletcher.
- Call me Fletch.
Your house is not quite as grand as some of the others in the neighborhood.
It doesn't matter. It's the thought that counts. Eighty acres, huh?
Mm-hmm.
Isn't it strikin'?
Your aunt tried to keep things in their natural state.
She ever brush her hair?
- I can see you're disappointed.
- No, not at all!
A little spackling and some napalm, this place would make a nice mausoleum.
Oh, my God!
Are you all right?
Oh! I was aimin' to fix that today. How do you do?
I be Calculus Entterby.
You be Mr. And Mrs. Fletcher?
I be Fletch. Geometry Fletch.
She be Miss Trigonometry Ross.
Pleased, I'm sure. Your Aunt Belle told me you'd be takin' over the place, and I'm extendin' my "condulations."
Right. You work here?
Your Aunt Belle and I, we had an arrangement.
And I was hopin' we could make an extenuation of it.
Help me get your stuff out the car here. Come on.
You mind your step.
Our families go back for hundreds of years.
Your great grandparents owned my great grandparents and that's how it all started.
Did you ever hear of the
Emancipation Proclamation?
I heard somethin' about it, but I don't recall exactly.
- It didn't get much publicity around these here parts.
- I'll bet.
Excuse me, sir.
Could you give me a hand?
R-Right here.
Just pull it towards you.
Just pull it.
Come on, come on.
Just pull it.
Just pull it on over.
That's it, that's it.
Don't scar the car.
Is there any electricity or gas?
Everything works.
No cable TV, I guess.
If I'd known you was comin', I'd have straightened out a bit and stocked your refrigerator.
No food?
No refrigerator.
We need to do some paperwork.
Want a lift into town?
What? And leave my estate unattended?
It's not yours till you sign.
I can make you some dinner, ease the culture shock.
That sounds great.
Should I be doin' anything?
No, not really.
Uh, soon as you get that trunk upstairs and have finished your nap,
I guess you could fix that step and jump down, turn around and pick a bale of cotton.
And while I'm gone, see to it Miss Scarlett stays away from the Union Army, will you?
More wine?
You're not trying to take advantage of me, are you?
Not yet.
You need to sign these papers.
Do you mind if I read 'em first?
Be my guest. Had you talked to your aunt recently?
That depends on your view of history. It's been 16 years.
Sign all three?
Please.
I was just wonderin' because she changed her will three weeks before she died.
Well, lucky for me.
Why'd she do that?
I don't know. She was old. Seemed to be under a lot of strain.
Dying always does that to you.
Congratulations. You know, you can make yourself some good money out of this.
A Realtor contacted me with an unusually high offer... 225,000.
- Dollars?
- Mm-hmm.
Let me ask you this:
If they're so anxious, don't you think if
I wait a little longer, they might go up?
- They might.
- And I just got here, didn't I?
No sale?
While you're thinking about it, what are you gonna do with the land, Fletch?
I don't know. Raise chitlins... the chitlin' market as high as it is.
They're mean little animals, but their coats are worth a fortune.
What do you think I oughta do?
If I were you, I would proceed slowly and carefully.
That's my specialty.
- Would you like some dessert?
- What do you have in mind?
How 'bout something sweet... and Southern?
I borrowed your toothbrush.
Would've used your razor, but it looks like you've been doing some gardening with it.
Gee, I can't believe we slept this late.
Amanda? Want to drive into Belle Isle?
I guess not.
It was good, but not that good.
'Morning, Mr. Fletcher. If that's your real name. I'm Billy Jo Hendrick.
Howdy.
What's your relationship to Amanda Ray?
She was my attorney.
She was working on my briefs.
- You come into town, y'all just hit it off?
- So to speak.
Sparks just flew. That's what you're gonna tell me.
Wonder why things like that never happen to me?
Wonder why!
Were y'all usin' some drugs you brought in from California by any chance?
Just some Beaujolais.
Beaujolais?
It's a pretty popular drug made from grapes?
- You feel like makin' a statement?
- A statement?
"Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country."
I guess you just wanna make it hard on everybody.
Well, let's see how you feel after some time in the tank. Y'all come.
All of us?
Just you.
- What's the charge?
- Pissin' me off.
Is that a felony or a misdemeanor? That's it!
You're cleaner than most of the ones we get around here.
You smell nice.
I expect you'll be popular.
Do you realize you have to read me my rights?
Or at least find someone who can read to do it for you.
A little gamy in here.
Not much ventilation, huh?
How's the chow?
You know, you really shouldn't wear so much eye makeup. It makes you look cheap.
You're sittin' on my bunk.
Sorry.
Shut up!
Take your pants off.
Ah, I don't even know your name.
Bend over.
Ben? Nice to meet you.
Victor Hugo.
You wouldn't happen to have a middle name, would you? Everybody else here seems to.
- What are you in for, Ben?
- Molesting a dead horse.
Ooh, there's no crime in that.
That's your right as an American.
I'm tryin' to cut down myself.
His missus hit him on the head with a ball pein hammer whilst he was eatin' sausage... and almost choked him to death.
Okay, beautiful, let's hope another long night in the tank has sobered you up.
Ben?
If I don't hear from you on Valentine's
Day, I'll be very disappointed.
Mr. Johnson, I'm surprised to see you here.
Judge Watkins usually assigns these small potatoes to Billy Ray.
Well, he's on vacation. This is the price
I pay for the proximity of my office.
Excuse me. Sir?
You don't have a card, do you? Or a price list?
Well, matter of fact,
I do.
I'm Hamilton Johnson.
I'm an attorney at law.
You take other cases or you just specialize in transvestite necrophiliacs?
Not enough evidence to hold you.
Just a petty form of intimidation putting you in a cell with that Neanderthal.
She wasn't so bad. If she'd just fix up her hair and shave her back.
It's so embarrassin', this sort of thing still goes on in the New South.
'Course, 20 years ago a Yankee like you could've been lyin' in the ditch.
I'm assumin', of course, that you had nothin' whatsoever to do with the death of Amanda Ray.
Sure hope not.
Hop in.
I was shocked to hear about this.
She was such a dear friend.
So tragic... when this happens to somebody so young and healthy.
Was she feelin' all right last night? She felt great to me.
Just smell that soft
Southern air.
It's so sad to see this beautiful pastoral countryside... blighted by the greed of a few men in pursuit of the almighty dollar.
That's my place over there.
The trees just beyond it screen off the
Bibleland Amusement Park in the daytime, but at night, they do make a hell of a racket.
- Thanks for everything, Hamilton.
- Most welcome. Just call me Ham.
Ham, call me Fletch.
All right, Fletch.
Anything I can do to help ya.
Fletch!
- Might I give you some personal advice?
- Is it free?
To the sheriff and his sort of people, you're an outsider.
Guilty in spite of the law.
Should I get outta town before sundown?
It's not that bad, but... if I were you, lookin' for peace and quiet...
Well, they can make it a might uncomfortable for ya.
It's gonna take time.
Thanks, Ham.
Bye.
My pleasure.
Anything I can do for ya.
Welcome back. I thought you run off for good. Does this car run?
Yeah, but Miss Belle stopped drivin' it when the brakes ran out.
I run a few errands from time to time, but if you wanna stop it, you got to think ahead.
Hmm. I finally got the place straightened out for you.
Mm-hmm. When was that?
Back in 1970?
Your Aunt Belle, she lived in this one room. Didn't take up much space.
Calculus?
Hmm?
You don't see a spider, do you?
Spiders is good. They eats the cockroaches. Yeah, sure they do.
Mister Owl.
This is more like it. This is what I came here for.
Yes, sir.
Peace and quiet.
Scum, scum, scum.!
Go back to where you come.!
- Friends of yours?
- Nothin' to me.
"The loyal sons of the...
Buford, where's the cross.
Did you bring the cross?
"White race will not allow any kind of alien infection... to invade our beloved land."
Scum, scum, scum.
Go back to where you come.
Let's do it together.
Scum, scum, scum. Go back...
Get the hell outta here and go home! Scum! Pigs!
Sorry I'm late.
Who goes there?
Henry Himmler.
What klavan claims you?
California klavan, Cucamonga.
California?
Yeah. I was passing through town and was lookin' for something to do this evening.
There was nothing goin' on at the
Rotary Club. I heard about this.
Welcome, Henry.
I'm the Grand Kleagle.
Oh.
California thing.
Pig-faced scum!
What's the occasion here? Oh, some undesirable carpetbagger... I think.
Damn! Boys, I just got a closer peek. There's nobody in there.
We're wasting our time.
- And I washed all these sheets.!
- Wh-Who's this?
Oh. Sorry. Hi, fellas. Hank Himmler.
Hi, Hank.
The cross won't burn, nobody home.
Hell, it ain't like it used to be.
You said it.
I couldn't get more than 13 guys out here tonight. Five of them are green recruits.
Kinda stand-ins, you know what I mean? Yeah.
We call 'em Klookies.
Klookies?
That's good! Of course, it's just a contract job.
Yeah.
Contract job?
Yeah.! We've been havin' a terrible time down here. We've had to rent out.
Here I come!
Gene Hackman, kick your ass.
They're speakin' some kind of African dialect!
Hi.
'Morning.
- Mr. Fletcher?
- As far as you know.
I'm Becky Ann Culpepper.
Thibodaux Realty.
I'd offer you some coffee and eggs
Benedict, but we're all out of Benedict.
Thanks.
I've already eaten.
What can I do to... for you?
Mr. Fletcher, you may have heard that there's a party interested in acquiring your property.
A substantial offer.
How substantial?
Whew!
I don't know.
I had big plans for this place.
Mini mall with a yogurt bar and a tanning parlor.
Well, Mr. Fletcher, all I know is $250,000... is a mighty generous price for land in this area.
Who's your client?
I'm not at liberty to say.
Well, then I'm not at liberty to sell.
This is a tremendous opportunity.
I'll tell you what. I'll consult with my people who will contact their people, and they'll get in touch with your people.
Who are your people?
- Who are yours?
- As I said, I have to keep that confidential.
Very well. I'll just have my people contact each other. Keep 'em busy.
All right. Well, just keep me in mind. Here's my card.
Oh, I'll keep you in mind.
Hope we can do this again sometime soon.
In about 10 minutes?
That night I decided to return to the scene of the crime.
It gave me a chance to check out my new car and practice my parallel parking.
So far the only really good suspect in Amanda's death was me, and I was pretty sure that I didn't do it.
Amanda knew more than she'd let on, but the only clue she'd left me... was a reference to Aunt Belle changing her will just before she died.
I knew the local police force was watching her place carefully... so there'd be no trouble getting in.
Over the years I found Mr. Underhill's credit card to be a useful tool... much like Underhill himself.
As usual, I was willing to risk my life just to get a peek into a filing cabinet.
I love them when they're unlocked, neatly organized and tell me what I wanna know.
Belle's legal files were in good order... with the exception of something missing under the heading of "Bluebird. '"
My aunt had almost left
Belle Isle to some minister.
Obviously at one time he must have touched her deeply.
Since she changed her mind, I guess he didn't touch her deeply enough... or in the right place.
Thank you very much. Couldn't find that light switch.
What the hell you doin' here? This is a restricted area. Didn't you see the sign?
Signs? Signs! That's all I see is signs. Look at this.
Stressed out "dormants" on the windows, walls that are deplaning to an alarming degree.
Deplaning? This house is obviously infested with reticulermes Mario Cuomos.
What's that?
What's what?
Reticulermes. You can't even say it yourself.
They are deadly African microscopic termites.
They can eat a hundred times their weight in five minutes.
Much like yourself. From the look of things, I'd say... this place is about ready to collapse. Who are you?
Billie Jean King, Bug Busters.
My van is parked out front.
Mr. King, I don't know nothin' about no Bug Busters.
The surgeon general was right.
They've been mighty busy here.
The only time you can catch 'em is at night.
Aha! I got one!
See that?
These little buggers are the piranhas of the insect world.
The only thing they like better than wood is human flesh. Really?
You bet. If you can't see it, how do you know you got one?
I'm glad I asked that question. They make this horrible high-pitched noise.
It's kinda like a tiny little scream. Can you hear that?
Can you hear that? It's like a tiny little piglet.
No? Uh-oh. I seem to have dropped it in your ear. You what?
That's all right.
We better get that. Can't let that nest in there. They multiply by masturbation.
The only way to get that out is to get as close to the floor as you can.
Go on down to the floor. That's right.
They're drawn to the floorboards.
Now shake your head like you're trying to get water out of your ear.
That's good. But hit it... No, hit it harder. This side. That's right.
Now make that scream. That'll draw 'em out. Squeal like a pig.
A little higher.
Hey, I found the queen!
I found the queen! I don't believe it. No one's ever found a queen.
I gotta get this to the lab and get a stool sample.
After my close call with Miss
Piggy, I couldn't wait to get home.
My head was filled with decorating ideas.
I didn't have a lot of money, but I could move the pool closer to the house.
I could see I wasn't gonna get much privacy.
- Who's there?
- It's Avon calling.
Oh.! It's you.!
- I'd like to talk to you for a minute.
- Yeah, come on in.
Come on in. Have a seat.
Make yourself at home.
What's on your mind?
Well...
What do you do?
Mud wrestle in this thing?
I'm sorry about that, but I won it in a raffle.
Must be an art to sitting in one of these. Lost art.
You get the Lakers? I'm lucky if I can get Wheel of Fortune.
Do you know any reason why somebody would want to buy this land?
Insect research.
Boston two-and-a-halfback of the Yankees.
I have an offer for $250,000.
Take the money and run!
What you thinkin'?
What do you know about this Farnsworth Ministry?
Jimmy Lee Farnsworth? Down here everybody knows about him.
Your Aunt Belle used to watch him when she was laid up.
...And that is have you've been saved?
I know that there are a lot of you out there tonight... that the devil has got a good, firm grip around your neck and is choking you to death.!
Amen!
I want you to send whatever you can afford.
If you've got a thousand dollars in the bank, don't be afraid to send the whole thousand dollars.
I need your money. Bibleland is only halfway there.
Bible... land.
The most important attraction... since the crucifixion itself.
Immediate seating for the 5:00 service.
The 5:00 service is about to begin.
Immediate seating for the 5:00 service.
Welcome, sinner.
Praise the Lord!
Bless you, bless her, bless him. Hallelujah! Name please.
Irwin Fletcher. Irwin M.
Fletcher. Irwin Mahatma Fletcher.
Address.
Seven.
It's time for the 4,323rd edition... of the Farnsworth
Television Ministry with...
Mimsy Carlyle,
God's own songbird.
The heavenly feet of Damon Feather.
Mr. Coco.
The Ringfield Revivalists.
The Bradley Family Singers and Ted Medly and the band.
And now, the host of our show, the ministry's founder and your friend...
Mr. Good News himself, the
Reverend Jimmy Lee Farnsworth.
I know that there is someone out there tonight... who needs to step forward.
Lyda Pearl Shindley.
Me?
Lyda Pearl, come on down here.! Give her a big hand, folks.! Make her welcome.!
All right.!
Bless you.
God bless you.
I know that you suffered a terrible tragedy when you lost Jo Bob... in the merry-go-round accident at the State Fair. I did.
I also know that Jo Bob left you financially stable.
But answer me this one question.
Has all of them riches brung you happiness, child?
No, they haven't.
I've sinned.
We've all sinned.
I know, but
I've really sinned.
Please, God, have her not mention my name.
Say it aloud so your soul might be cleansed.
I'm so ashamed. I slept with my best friend's husband.
You are forgiven. Praise the Lord. Amen!
- And I also slept with my Uncle James.
- You are forgiven, child.
Ladies and gentlemen, doesn't it take a tremendous amount of courage... to come up here on nationwide cable hookup... and confess to human frailties?
And I also shoplifted this blouse and... You've been forgiven.
Demons out!
Praise be.! Praise the Lord.!
- Ladies and gentlemen, praise be, praise the Lord.
- Bravo!
Surely Lyda Pearl was not alone.
Surely there is someone else out there whose life is full of confusion.
Irwin M. Fletcher just inherited
Belle Isle. I sense grief.
I sense deep grief and loneliness.
I sense a recent bereavement.
Someone who has lost an uncle or an aunt.
Mr. Fletcher.
- Mr. Irwin M. Fletcher.
- That's me.
Are you out there?
Step forward, young man.
The Lord's calling to you. Come on up here. Give him a big hand.
Make him welcome.
Come on down here.
Your Aunt Belle recently passed away, didn't she, son? Yes, she did. Yeah.
Are you still grieving in your heart, son?
Absolutely.
And even her generous gift to ya of the ancestral home, the beautiful Belle Isle, has not eased the grief, pain and sufferin' in your heart now, has it?
Not a hell of a lot.
No.
Irwin, admit that you are a sinner.
Uh, well I've sinned. Didn't take any Polaroids or anything.
But... I've sinned.
Yeah.
The Lord forgives ya!
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Thank you. Amen.
What? Other sins?
Uh, I parked in a handicapped spot on my way over here.
Actually on a handicapped person.
I told him I'd be out in five minutes so that's not such a big deal.
There have been other things. They're personal, so I wouldn't wanna get into it on TV.
But I have sinned and I'm sorry about it. Thanks.
God forgives ya!
Amen.!
The good Lord is gonna ease... the pain and sufferin' in your heart... with a bright light of grace.
Look out, you demons!
Demons, demons, out!
Oh! That was great.
Praise the Lord.
Another soul saved by Jimmy
Lee Farnsworth. How about that?
I dangled Belle Isle like bait in front of Jimmy Lee and he took the hook.
I could tell, at the heart, he was a deeply religious man and I liked his teeth.
Once we've had a chance to expand,
Bibleland's gonna be like some kind of heaven on earth... if it isn't already.
- There's the hotel.
- Hi, Reverend.
We call it the Heavenly Hilton and Convention Center.
Beyond that is the
Farnsworth Bible College.
If you look down the road, you see the Jump for Jesus Trampoline Center.
- What do you think?
- It's unbelievable.
You don't suppose I use too many photographs of myself, do ya?
No! No!
It worked for the Ayatollah.
Mr. Fletcher, your Belle Isle's a bit rundown.
That sucker's gonna eat you alive in maintenance.
You don't know how much your land would mean to our ministry.
And to God, too, of course. After all, he does give us our guidance now, doesn't he?
- Amen!
- You bet your ass.
Like my mother used to say,
"There's a tick for every dog. '"
What did your mother mean by that?
Why in God's name you let Farnsworth's ministry burrow into your fur?
Why would you even think of givin' away your property when you got a big cash offer on it?
I don't know. I guess I thought, after a lifetime of hedonism, it was time to rededicate my life.
Nah, I just wanted to see what would happen if I went along with him.
Well, it happened.
The sheriff's office called.
The charges against you have been dropped.
Is that right?
Mm-hmm.
The ministry has a good deal of influence around here.
I suppose you've heard that your... aunt was under considerable emotional strain in the weeks before she died?
Yeah, I've heard that.
So was my mother.
They took advantage of her.
These Holy Rollers.
When she was at death's door, they preyed on her faith and her fear.
When she was no longer able to make rational decisions, persuaded her to give away our land for that amusement park.
My guess is that your speedy conversion and your promised gift... played no small part in the charges against you being dropped.
Well, whatever.
At least I'm off the hook.
And who or what do they think is responsible for Amanda Ray's death?
The autopsy report come in today.
They said she died of a heart attack. Natural causes.
Either she had some congenital defect... or... you're one hell of a lover.
Probably both.
I needed more background on Farnsworth so I called Frank for a favor.
Maybe I should've asked him to check out Calculus Entterby.
I liked him, but I wasn't buying his Amos and Andy routine.
He seemed a lot smarter than that.
I never took you to be no murderer. That's a relief.
So who's the odds on favorite now?
Nobody.
They're sayin' she dropped dead in her sleep. Yeah!
The odds on that?
Same as catchin' a bass this afternoon.
What's that?
About 258,000 to one.
You sure you don't wanna back out?
I'm in.
This be the morgue?
Have the police come yet?
What? The police! They was bringing a doctor to make a death certificate.
You got a stiff, boy, you're in the right place. Where is it?
In my Cadillac.
Put him on the gurney. Take him in the back with the rest of'em.
Don't bother me.
I'm watchin The Terminator.
You better put a steerin'wheel on that. Excuse me, sir.
I'll be right back now.
- What's that stickin' out?
- His lucky golf cap.
Hey.!
You gotta tag his toe.
- He got a name?
- Eldridge Cleaver.
Take him in the back, strip him. Hold it.
Let's see what Mr. Cleaver has, or should I say, had.
Wait a minute.
Shouldn't I get that?
Tell you what.
I'll make you a deal.
You call me whenever you want,
I'll tell you what time it is.
Now get movin!
- Eldridge Cleaver.
- Shh.
Good evening, Mr. Hoffa.
Amanda Ross. Amanda Ross.
Five.
Can I take a look?
Yeah, go on.
Boo!
Any mail for me?
You don't have a Tic-Tac, do you?
What happened?
I black out?
Did I land the plane safely? Passengers hurt?
No.
Everything's okay?
Check that air-conditioning.
What'd you find out, Fletch?
Cremated. I wouldn't be surprised if all the paperwork was burnt up with the body.
The morgue proved to be a dead end.
But I guess it is for most people.
I had three questions. Why was
I cleared in Amanda's death?
Why, if she wasn't murdered, was the body so quickly destroyed?
And finally, when it comes to stewed prunes, are three enough or are four too many?
When I got back to Belle Isle, there was a cozy fire in the fireplace... and on the roof, on the walls and on the porch.
It was great.
Think maybe I should pack.
Guess you'll be movin' in with me now. Thanks, Cal.
Look at the bright side. You won't have to bother dusting anymore. Yes, sir!
Here's your diet plate.
Thank you, Miss Selma. Does everything around here come with the head still on it?
- You bet, honey.
- Glad I didn't order a hamburger.
I'd say grace, but I don't wanna wake him up.
Are you religious?
I believe in a God that doesn't need heavy financing.
How you doin', Mr. Barbour?
How's it goin', Calculus?
Fine, fine.
This here's Mr. Fletcher.
He's the new owner of Belle
Isle, or whatever's left of it.
Yeah, I heard about your fire. Sorry about that.
You know, you've had your share of problems ever since you've been here.
How about me and the boys showing you some real Southern hospitality?
You ever been on a coon hunt?
Now a coon hunt is like an English fox hunt, except we cut through all the bullshit, all the fancy clothes and music, all the beautiful women.
We reduce the experience to its essence.
Yeah, a bunch of sweaty drunks chasin' a scared animal.
You're damn right.!
What am I supposed to do?
The dogs do most of the work.
We just follow the dogs, they tree the coon, we get him down.
This drug testing has gone too far.
Take a jolt.
Kick-a-poo joy juice?
Oh, stronger than that!
Whoo!
Aren't you coming?
Nah, it ain't safe for a black man to be chasin' around these woods at night... unless he be handcuffed to a white man.
I'll see you back at... my
"domiside." You want some of this?
You haven't lived till you've been on a coon hunt, and after that, you don't want to.
But it gave me a chance to snoop around the neighborhood.
The ministry seemed so hot for all this land. Why?
Maybe they just wanted a remote spot to bury Jim and Tammy.
Where the hell are we? Actually, this is my place, or was.
I ain't been on it since I sold the sucker.
This is your property over here and that's Ham's mama's old place over there.
Don't you think we oughta catch up with the boys?
Damn right. There's a couple of'em I don't think I should leave alone with the dogs.
Oh, wait up.
Jesus! What happened to my flower garden?
Everything's dead!
Yo, Barbour.! Rags has got a water moccasin in his mouth.
Hey, we in luck. You wanna jerk the head off a snake?
Oh, no.
I gave it up for Lent.
I'm not gonna miss the fun.
Hey, guys, wait up!
I never liked guns, especially when they're pointed at me.
And this night a couple of people were taking pot shots in my general direction.
It was time to get outta there.
% Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na Na-na-na-na% %
I was heartbroken to miss the raccoon, but all I wanted was a good night's sleep so I headed for Cal's water bed.
Welcome back. Jimmy Lee was on a roll tonight.
Ten salvations. Big bucks. You catch a coon?
I was shot at. Somebody's sure trying to scare me off.
And they don't mind killing me to underline the threat.
You were shot at? Yep.
Now, who would do that?
Damn shame. I'll go outside and see what's goin' on.
What was it? I thought I saw somethin'.
I just fired in the air to scare whatever it was.
Didn't sleep well that night, and it wasn't the fault of the water bed.
Something was rotten in this whole situation.
Figuring out that the thug who dropped my watch... was the same guy who stole it at the morgue didn't take Sherlock Holmes.
Larry Holmes could've figured that out.
I wasn't sure who'd be taking the next shot at me, so I decided to work alone.
Fletch, perfect timing. I've got just what you asked for.
Frank, stop salivating. I'm sending you my Laker high-tops for lab analysis.
He's behaving very strangely.
He must be in trouble.
Somebody must be holding a gun to his head.
Fletch, if you need rescuing, just say,
"I believe Louisiana is the Pelican State."
Okay, Frank. I believe Louisiana is the
Pelican State... as a matter of fact.
- What do you have on Farnsworth?
- I've got everything you need.
Jimmy Lee Farnsworth, former used-car salesman in Biloxi.
In '77, he pleaded "no contest" to a charge of check kiting.
'81, discovered by businessmen who helped him found the Farnsworth Television Ministry.
Our sources indicate he may be a target of federal investigation.
- Anything else?
- Uh, two marriages.
One daughter goes by wife's maiden name. Becky Culpepper.
It was hard to believe that beautiful
Becky was Farnsworth's daughter.
But I wasn't gonna hold it against her.
If I was gonna hold anything against her, it certainly wouldn't be her father.
Fletch, I heard about the fire. I hope you're all right.
I'm just fine.
I was just lying in the embers of my house, trying to calm my nerves after being shot at.
What? You were shot at? I was thinking what a good day to sell my property... and move back to Los Angeles.
Is the buyer still interested?
No, I'm afraid he withdrew.
I still have five minutes on the meter. Let's talk in your office.
Now, why don't you tell me who your client is?
Is it the
Farnsworth Ministry?
Why would you say that?
And who is shooting at you?
Maybe the
Reverend Farnsworth.
Look, Jimmy Lee Farnsworth may be a lot of things, but he's not a murderer.
You're right, he is many things.
A former used-car salesman, a confessed embezzler, your father, good square dancer.
That's right, he is my father.
But I'm also telling you the truth.
Becky, somebody wants my land bad enough to kill me for it.
Now, if you don't tell me who your client is, I'm gonna find out some other way.
It is guest healer's night with Jimmy Lee on this... the 4,323rd edition of our show with tonight's special guests... people with the healing gift.
Excuse me. May I have your name? I'm Claude Henry...
Claude Henry...
Claude Henry.
Claude... Claude or Clod is good. Henry.
Henry.
Smmoot.
Henry. Smmoot. S-M-M-O-T-T.
I'm sorry. Two "O's," one "T."
I'm a guest healer.
Smmoot, a guest healer.
Yes. Healed.
God bless you.
With Mimsy Carlyle.
Wait here.
The heavenly feet... of Damon Feather.
God's simian favorite,
Mr. Coco.
The guest healers who have volunteered for tonight's show will follow Jimmy Lee.
And now the founder of our show, your friend,
Mr. Good News himself,
Jimmy Lee Farnsworth.!
You know,
I have a feeling that there's someone out there amongst us who needs to step forward.
Gordon Joe James.
Gordon Joe James.
Who are you?
Gordon Joe lost a limb to a pit bull.
Gordon Joe, will you please stand and raise your right hand?
Left hand.
Excuse me, left hand.
There you are.!
Bibleland Two.
Jimmy Lee's dream.
He was like some deranged
Walt Disney.
It was all in front of me.
Ham Johnson's place.
His mother's bequest.
Belle Isle.
The numbers on the boxes were certainly not zip codes. Maybe computer codes.
All I needed now was a computer, and a ten-year-old kid to teach me how to use it.

% Or MasterCard%

Bobby Ralph?
Peter Lemongello.
Your house is on fire.
What? They told me to tell you, your house is on fire.
I'll take over.
God bless you!
God bless you for believing this shit.
There was a new element I hadn't anticipated:: A second suspect.
Becky's client was not the ministry, but some secret entity called Everest Development.
She never knew who they were.
Becky was a good girl, and wouldn't have to be spanked. Damn it.
Who's gonna be the next one to get the call?
Who's gonna be the next one saved?
- Who's going to be...
- T'Boo Ted Marshall.
T'Boo Ted Marshall, are you with us tonight?
Yes, indeed, Reverend.!
But how can God help my problem?
T'Boo Ted is a...
Compulsive gambler.
T'Boo Ted, the first you gotta do is expose that problem!
Excuse me?
If you can't expose that problem, at least to your family, it grows and grows, and becomes an even bigger problem.!
That's true!
He's been a compulsive gambler for 20 years.
Because you've had this affliction for more than 20 years,
I think you should expose that problem to us... right here... tonight.
I want you to do it. The good Lord wants you to do it!
- You really think so?
- I know so!
Do it. Do it now!
Well, if you say so.
Oh, God, put your pants back on.!
Coming right back to introduce our guest healers.
Let's welcome all of them beginning with Claude Henry Smmoot.
Come on out, Claude!
Here we are.
I have a headache.
No, Claude, this way.
You're gonna do just fine.
Now, get out there. Go on.
I said, get out there now!
Here he is!
Make him welcome, folks!
Welcome, Claude Henry.
When was the very first time, the very first moment that made the difference in your life?
Well, Jimmy Lee, I was...
I was, uh, on my gazebo, on the roof making some repairs, and I was struck by lightning.
I have had acute migraine headaches and blurred vision since then.
But praise the Lord, that was my lucky day because... ever since then I have had the healing power.
Amen. God bless you. Thank you very much. Good night. Thank you.
Claude Henry. Good night.
What? What happened? Yes?
Before you heal another, would you like for me to attempt to heal your own affliction?
No, no! No, no. No, those of us with perfect faith... have no need of perfect vision.
We have no need of wisdom.
We have no need of anything except the creature comforts and lots of them.
Hallelujah.! Amen.! God bless you. Amen. Thank you. Hallelujah.
Ladies and gentlemen, he sees more than he doth know.
- Yes, I do.
Amen!
Claude Henry has the gift.!
Would you use that gift, Claude
Henry? Would you use it now?
I guess I could.
Praise be.
Reverend, I sense that in our audience... there is a gentleman by the name of Jim Bob.
Jim Bob, would you stand up?
Would you rise, please?
Sixteen, 17...
I sense that Jim Bob is a young man.
That he is between the ages of 25, 27.
That's more like it.
I feel the Lord is telling me that
Jim Bob suffers from the same...
Satanized affliction that I suffer from: : Migraine headaches.
Don't you, Jim Bob?
Is that you?
Come on down, Jim Bob.!
Praise be.! Hallelujah.!
Amen.!
Praise the Lord!
Be saved!
Jim Bob, welcome.
God bless you.
Jim Bob, how long have you had these headaches?
About five, 10 minutes.
God... help him!
- And how do you feel now?
- It's a throbbing...
God bless you. A throbbing headache comes up through your heels, up through the hip bone, the knee bone, up the spine, up through your back, through your head like Satan was belching through you?
- Is that it?
- Exactly.
- Do you believe?
- I believe.
He believes! Hallelujah!
Amen! God bless. Amen.
Hallelujah.
Rid this man of these headache demons, of these migraine demons.
Heal this man!
Amen!
Amen!
Hallelujah!
Oh, good golly, Miss Molly!
How do you feel, son?
My headache is gone, but...
God bless him! Is there anything else I can do for you?
No! No. Good! God bless you. Praise be.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much. Ouch!
I am worn to the bone.
Thank you very much for gracing us with your presence.
Good night. Praise be!
Maybe I was wrong about Farnsworth.
There was a new player in the game: : Becky's unknown client.
I had to find out more, and the only way was to get into her pants...
I mean, her car. At least it had brakes. Her car, that is.
Fletch, what are you doing?
The guy who works in there stole my watch.
He dropped it while he was trying to kill me. I'd just as soon he not recognize me.
I'd like to keep an eye on him.
Maybe he'll lead us to his boss.
How long are we gonna be here?
Bored?
Oh, no!
This is exciting!
Fletch?
What?
I have to pee.
The same thing used to happen whenever I'd play hide-and-seek.
I always got caught. You think the morgue has a ladies' room?
Hey.
Not so close. Try to get a little distance between you.
I'm gonna have to play it pretty tough in there. Still have to pee?
I gather the rain isn't helping a lot.
- There's always the bushes.
- I'll be okay.
If I'm not back in five minutes, call your dad.
Could I have a soda, please?
Diet Pepsi or a Tab would be good.
- Hey, pussy.
- Name's Ed. Ed Harley.
Are you sure you're in the right place?
I think so.
"Think so"!
Ed, what are you doin' here?
I'll give you a hint.
Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
Hmm?
You don't get it?
You're the one that doesn't get it.
Ed Harley.
Harley-Davidson Motorcycles.
You own the company?
Well, my granddaddy started it. Then my daddy screwed Davidson out of his half.
Now I own the whole thing.
- Harley-Davidson?
No shit? - No shit.
Hey, y'all, Ed Harley of Harley-Davidson!
We're the Nazis from Natchez!
Who're you callin', babe?
Knock it off! Yo, boss, look who's here!
Harley-Davidson. Yo, Ed, come over here and meet the boss.
Hi. Ed Harley, the Third.
Harley-Davidson Motorcycles.
If you need any T-shirts or decals,
I can make arrangements for you.
I just can't wait.
- What model do you ride?
- '78 XL.
'78 XL? That's a legend!
It's not blue, is it?
- You in luck, white boy. Come on.
- Oh!
There she is. Ain't she beautiful? Original blue!
Oh, she is a beaut. Gee, golly,
I'd love to ride this '78 XL.
Nobody... touches my Hog.
- Sorry. - If you wanna ride that low-rider, that's all right.
Hell, we'll all ride.
Fire 'em up!
Do you mind if...
Darleen.
- If Darleen rides with me?
- Feeling a little horny, Ed?
Yeah. You know, my life isn't all hubs and gears.
Take it easy.

Home!
Oh, my God!
I'm a mess.
You want some coffee?
Sure.
I look like a raccoon.
I gotta get to work, although I don't know why. All I do is sit with nothing to do.
The only work I've had in the last three months has been with Everest Realty.
And look what that's gotten me. Can I use your phone?
Sure, go ahead.
That's toxic waste on the soles.
What have you been doing?
Jogging in the Love Canal.
What do you mean "toxic waste"?
- It's special. There's only 11 places that make this shit.
- Where?
Frank, just give me the ones that aren't in New Jersey.
Ah, there's only one.
Yazoo, Mississippi.
Bingo.
I wanna thank you for everything you've done.
I'm sorry I caused such a mess.
Can I ask you a personal question? Mm-hmm.
Did you finally get to pee?
Yes.
Good.
You better get cleaned up.
Yeah.
Particularly my mind.
Where's the shampoo?
I'll get you some.
Here. You'll need a clean towel too.
No, yours will be fine.
Fletch!
You're right.
This is too wet.
You know how to get to Yazoo?
Well, you're in the right vicinity.
The church seemed less and less culpable.
Why would they want toxic waste next to their land? Why would anybody?
Why are there four S's in Mississippi?
Four I's and only two P's... and one "M'" as far as I know?
Bly Bio Chem was the biggest chemical plant in Mississippi.
My Laker shoes were ruined by toxic waste produced there.
They probably knew who delivered it to my backyard.
Now the lead-lined containers painted with innocent bluebirds... added a crucial piece to the puzzle... that had begun way back in Amanda Ross's pants...
I mean, bedroom.
This is a secure area.
I'm very happy for you. Most people live in terrible neighborhoods.
Are you the head honcho? That's right, sir. Headly Dan Duke.
And what seems to be your problem?
I agreed to take a shit load of that Bluebird crap off your hands.
And it ain't come yet. I'm very sorry, sir. And you are?
I are pissed!
Some damn fool told me it was on back order, and I'd have to wait.
Whose signature is this?
Who signed that? I can't...
That's the trouble! It's typical of a large corporation.
Lack of communication. That's why I like to keep Everest small.
Oh, you're from Everest!
Now you're talkin'!
Elmer Gantry. Elmer Fudd Gantry. I'm not sure there's anything I can do.
You could pull my file instead of standing there pulling your pud!
Whatever you say, sir.
Bring me the Everest file.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Gantry?
I apologize for my bellicosity.
I've had a hernia operation.
Is that the stuff
I'm supposed to get?
Yes, sir. Why are they wearing those funny suits?
They're protective, as you know. That's a very corrosive by-product they're handling.
Oh, yeah. I guess if they didn't wear those suits, those boys would be so full of holes, they'd whistle when they walked.
I've been spitting up blood, pissing blood, bleeding.
I go through five of these suits a day.
It appears you have your facts wrong, Mr. Gantry.
Your company is supposed to get 1500 gallons.
Destination someplace called Belle Isle in Louisiana.
Signed for by an officer of your company and due the 23rd.
So... we're right, and you're wrong.
Let me see that.
Takes a big man to admit when he's wrong. I am not a big man.
We're late again, because you had to stay late at the jail.
Hurry up.
Just get out.
Are you all right?
You're wrecking my present.
My fault?
Wash and gas it.
Check the brake fluid, will ya?
My friends, ladies and gentlemen.
With all the fun we've been having, I hope we don't forget our real purpose here tonight... to preserve the legacy that nature has given us.
We are mere custodians of...
Bob Lee.
Bobby Lee. Bobby Lee.
Bobby Lee.
Bobby Lee Schwartz.
Schwartz.
Schwartz, the Second.
Fletch!
What you doin' here?
- What are you doin' here?
- You know me. I ain't happy unless I'm working.
Why, Fletch, I'm surprised to see you here, sir. Welcome, sir, welcome.
My pleasure, my pleasure.
Thank you for not inviting me.
Oh!
I do believe we have something to discuss.
Oh. Well, might I suggest we repair ourselves to a quieter place.
Let us remove ourselves, shall we?
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.
My mama's room.
I've kept it just the way it was when she died.
Her ashes?
She used to say, "We come from the earth and we return to the earth, and in between, we garden."
A little gardening, a little polluting.
They spelled my name wrong.
My gun's made of rubber.
How 'bout yours?
No.
I see your point.
Wouldn't do for your conservationists guests to hear about... that load of toxic waste heading for my land at Belle Isle.
My land... at Belle Isle, Fletch.
After you die, who's gonna prove that you did not sell your land to Everest?
You may have this town in your back pocket, Johnson, but there are a lot of people downstairs who are gonna be very interested... in the hows and whys of Amanda Ray's death.
She knew about Bluebird.
She started a file on you, and you found out about it.
That was my lucky night. The night I found the Bluebird file, the night you porked her.
I figured it was like an alligator shoot on the freeway, if you'll excuse the metaphor.
- It's not a metaphor. It's a simile, to be precise.
- Whatever.
So you poisoned Amanda, figuring I'd sell and get out if I was facing a murder charge.
- I don't scare easy. I'm too dumb.
- So it would seem.
Now get out of my mama's chair before
I put the first bullet up your nose.
Are you kidding?
You pull that trigger and 100 people will be up here in a second.
My dear boy, why would
I do my own dirty work?
Those hundred do-gooders down there dressed in rebel crap... will be my alibi.
Now get outta my mama's chair!
I synchronized my beloved Laker watch with Miss Culpepper's Timex.
If I don’t join her at the ministry in 10 minutes, the whole ugly story... goes out on the Farnsworth Network.
Of course, it's cable, but...
- You're bluffing, Fletch.
- No, I'm not.
You think you're not... but you are.
Swell.
- Did he hurt you?
- Not yet. That comes later.
Sorry, Becky.
The band won't take a break for some time, so screaming would be futile.
Mr. Fletch's convenient appearance has allowed us... to move up our plans for your demise to coincide with his.
Now I'm goin' downstairs to be the gracious host.
Do what you have to do.
- The bride of Frankenstein.
- Put my mama down!
Oh! I'm sorry.
Oh, how clumsy of me.
Oops! I'm sorry. I stepped right on her mustache.
Get away! Get away!
- Sorry. I was just trying to help.
- It's all right, Mama.
You should be more careful where you put your breakables.
I've been careful all my life.
When she was sick,
I was careful.
Then that goddamn Jimmy Lee's ministry... taking everything she had.
Bloodsuckers!
It's gonna be all right, Mama.
And when we're far, far away... from this godforsaken chemical swamp, we're gonna sit back and watch 'em all just decompose.
That should be good for Bibleland's business, all their customers glowing in the dark.
I hope they all fry in hell!
- You bloodsucking bastards!
- Isn't this interesting?
- Put that down.
- She really is in there.
- Put that down.
- She seems to have lost a little weight.
I thought you had her stuffed and mounted. Here she is. Head's up!
Ohh! Ohh!
Becky!
Swine... Darryl, are you having a good time?
Welcome to great Noah's Ark... where we have a flood every 10 minutes.
In the...
No! This way.
Join our pyramid of prayer.
For only $12, you begin your exciting journey up the pyramid.
And when you reach the top, you're gonna be the target of 20,000 prayers!
A lady in Fargo, North Dakota broke the chain and began a five-day fit of sneezing... that ended in her death.
Daddy?
Well, Mr. Fletcher, what a pleasant surprise. And, Becky, what are you...
Look who's here! Hamilton
Johnson! Friend of the community.
Ham, you look like you've worked up quite a sweat.
Maybe you should dry your hair first. Do you want a towel?
Uh-oh, he's got a gun.
Show your lovely face on national television.
Let 'em see that greedy glint in your eye.
Let 'em hear that bullshit chuckle, Ham.
Who's gonna save you now,
Fletch?
You'll have to shoot through me, you son of a bitch!
He's not gonna shoot anybody. Are you, Ham? You're on television now.
You haven't got the guts.
- My mistake.
- Freeze!
F.B.I. Drop the gun!
I said, drop it. Harry!
And it's my plan to rerun this incident every night during Sweeps Week.
The obvious question is... What did you know and when did you know it?
And how long did you plan on letting me twist in the wind?
Up to a point. The Agency was barking up the same tree you were.
Jimmy Lee's finances.
Yep.
It was easy for Harry and Field Officer
Vincent to infiltrate the ministry.
Field Officer Vincent?
That's Mr. Coco's real name.
We've been working on this case for over a year.
Excuse me, Agent Goldstein, the officer would like to speak to you. Surely.
Goldstein?
Thank you, sir.
Ding dong, the wicked witch is dead.
So what's next, Fletch?
Back to L.A.?
There's no place like home.
Unless home is here.
You know what? We gotta get you away from this chemical swamp.
I was wondering...
Do you like smog?
Back home there was a surprise party for me.
But the nicest surprise was an insurance check for the Belle Isle fire... $ 100,000.
However, no one stopped Bly Bio Chem from dumping that toxic waste on my land.
They told me not to worry. Its half-life was estimated at 3,000 years.
Everything okay, Fletch?
Betty was a little pissed off about giving up her office, and accounting gave me some flak about the new car, but trust me, everything's gonna be just the way you want it, maybe better.
I like your attitude, Frank.
Excuse me just a sec. What a guy!
I thought I told you... never to come to my workplace.
Time's change, my dear Fletch.
Rumor has it that you have inherited a sizable piece of property.
Who told you?
I have my sources too.
These sources also suggest that you may have been considering skipping town... and retiring on this vast estate.
Thus skipping out on your financial responsibilities.
Would I do that? Wendy could probably get half of it anyway.
So in return for the other half, we would forego any other claims.
Think about it.
You would never see me again.
Where do I sign?
I'll never see you again?
Never.
You realize this is my family land?
Does it please you to rip out my ancestral roots?
I was born and raised in a briar patch.
Now Wendy can live a life of leisure.
Clean air, clean water. This is the way she was destined to live.
Okay, Gillet.
You've broken me.
I hope you're happy.

Did you say something?
No.
That's odd.
Didn't you hear that?
There was a voice.
That's Sarasate on the record.
What's he saying?
So you don't understand.
Hey!
A dead body has washed up!
She was a fisherman's wife.
She fell in love with a traveler.
They ran away together.
But she ended up holding him back.
So he pushed her into the sea.
They were last seen arguing on the rocks last night.
Seen by the light of the moon.
Name and address?
Are you deaf?
No, I can hear.
Are you making fun of me?
No, that's your role.
You've got no reason to arrest me.
No reason?
You know perfectly well why.
No, I don't!
I want an explanation!
There's no escape.
Give yourself up.
Give up?
Enough!
Wait. Excuse me.
Who are you?
Here's my card.
"Military Academy..."
Professor of German.
Senior Professor.
This is my friend.
His name is Nakasago.
He was also a professor at the academy.
A professor?
You can, of course, make further inquiries.
That won't be necessary.
My apologies.
Please forgive me.
That wasn't very nice of you.
I invited you to come with me.
But you refused and went off alone.
You did the same thing.
No. I wanted to go with you.
But you refused, so I had to go alone.
I didn't expect to run into you like this.
Six in all.
Six crabs crawled out from her crotch.
They were red all over.
They ate her flesh.
That's why they were all red.
- What do you think?
- About what?
You think I killed her, don%you?
But I didn't.
She killed herself.
I told her not to follow me.
She just went crazy.
It was suicide.
Still, you're partly responsible for her death.
Hey!
The first and most important thing
Is that a man should not sleep alone
The written character for 'man', perhaps
Shows two people sleeping together
As for the second point
What would they do when they shared a bed?
That's enough!
I fancy some eel.
I'll eat you.
What about you, sir?
Any one will do.
Will she cook them?
Yes, she's very good.
Call a geisha.
Not a sourpuss, one with some life.
I'm sorry, no geisha are available.
They're all busy.
- All of them?
- Yes, I'm sorry.
They're all attending a party for the prefectural officials.
This is one big eel.
Eels are our local speciality.
It's O-lne. O-lne!
- Hey! She's a geisha!
- No, I'm sorry.
- She's not?
- Well, yes, but not today.
- Why not?
- Her younger brother just died.
We just held the funeral.
She's in mourning.
A geisha in mourning, eh?
That's interesting.
- Call her.
- But, sir...
His bones were red?
My brother poisoned himself.
When you take poison, the stomach ruptures.
You normally writhe and vomit blood.
But he wanted to keep the room clean.
He died without spitting a single drop of blood.
His face was all twisted in agony and torment.
And then?
Then we cremated him.
His bones weren't any different.
Ordinary white bones. But...
When I brought the urn home and lifted the lid...
Was it red?
A pale pink.
Like cherry blossom.
As if blood was seeping out.
That's strange.
The old folks say the blood he didn't spit out stained his bones.
That he can never rest in peace, and I must pray for him every day.
Red bones, eh?
Your bones are pretty and delicate too.
I'm not weak, though.
I'd never take poison.
Sorry about all that.
Though hundreds of leagues from the capital
I must tell you that my member missed you so much
The redness of your Gate of Heaven pulsates
A woman takes her pleasure beneath her man's belly
Oh, how good it was to share the same bed
No one thought she would ever take another man
Why did your brother kill himself?
I really don't know.
Apparently he fell in love with a married woman and was jilted.
Quite foolish of him.
Two men and a woman.
A triangle.
That's always dangerous.
Don't you agree?
Oh, the beggars?
A father and his children.
The battle between the sheets has passed its climax now
She reaches down, rag in hand, and wipes her twat clean
They're husband and wife.
Please take me in your arms and do it again
I'll do my best to make it hard for you
The older man and the girl.
The young man is his student.
How do you know?
I should know.
They come here every year.
I'm afraid it takes much longer
To stand again the second time
If I can't get it up, you'll have to sup
Stop it! Stop that!
Hello again!
- Did you eat the eel?
- Yes.
- But no liver, right?
- How did you know?
The cook takes all the livers home.
The cook at the inn?
She takes them to her sick husband.
He has TB.
Eel liver is good for that.
She makes him eat them raw, from mouth to mouth.
She loves him.
She refuses doctors.
She even sleeps with him.
She really does love him.
The very same bed.
Delicious.
- That's strange.
- What?
You have a strong Tokyo accent.
You can tell?
I lived in Tokyo as a child.
And you became a geisha there?
My father had debts.
He sold me off.
Why did you come back?
I had to leave Tokyo.
I caused some trouble.
Man trouble?
You killed him?
Or just made him suffer?
A known killer, eh?
So you took to the road?
Hey, Speak up.
I'm no killer! I didn't expect you to get drunk so easily.
I killed a woman.
It was two nights ago.
The police caught me yesterday.
That fellow there saved me.
I got away with murder.
That's not funny.
He is joking, right?
I wonder.
I wouldn't be surprised.
I pushed her off the cliff.
It looked to me as if he were sucking out her liver.
It seems their relationship has changed.
The old man looks really beat.
Ouch! That hurts.
- Time to go!
- Yes, master!
Let's part ways here.
You're not coming back with me?
I'm going to follow the beggars.
Something fun is bound to happen.
Hey, wait.
I envy you.
You're always so free.
Selfish too.
Hey!
Nakasago got married the next year.
His wife came from a good family in western Japan.
Nakasago Residence
Ah, you're here.
Welcome.
My name is Sono.
They're alike, aren't they?
An incredible resemblance.
What's this secret you two share about me looking like someone?
Who is she?
Please tell me.
Well...
Tell me.
Go on, tell her.
Please.
Sorry, no.
Why not?
I can't really explain.
This is delicious.
The beef is so good.
We're not trying to be mean by keeping it from you. Right?
It's a geisha.
You look like a geisha named O-lne.
Unlike you, she's a lousy cook.
She's a geisha after all.
- Pour me some sake.
- Right.
Did you say something?
No.
That's odd.
Didn't you hear it?
I heard a voice.
Sarasate's voice.
While he was playing during the recording, he said something.
It ended up on the recording of the music.
At first they thought it was a glitch.
But that's what actually made the record famous.
What did he say, this Sarasate?
I've listened many times, but I can't make it out.
I thought you might be able to hear it.
I don't think I can either.
If only it were a bit clearer.
Speaking of voices,
I heard a strange voice.
I visited my wife's sister in hospital.
She said something strange today.
I'm to give you the cod eggs in the cupboard.
Did she mean me?
Apparently so.
Then she fell asleep.
This is delicious.
Do we have cod eggs?
We should have.
No?
No, we don't.
That's strange.
I thought we did.
You're just tired.
Is she really going to die?
I noticed that all the life has left her eyes.
But she can still see?
I wonder.
Her eyes seemed to be watching us.
But I'm not sure.
Besides, the shape of her nose has changed.
She's too young to die.
I think she'll get well again.
- Why?
- Why not?
You're wrong!
Ah!
It wasn't you who said,
"You're wrong!"?
No.
If I had, my wife wouldn't have been so shocked.
Then she said it.
No. She has this strange habit.
When something new happens to her she always looks into her mirror.
She did that immediately.
Proving it was a new experience for her.
Then it must have been you.
You said it.
If I'd been alone, of course, maybe I just imagined it.
But my wife heard it too.
It's a sign!
You say what you don't mean to say.
And you make out it's somebody else's voice.
You've gone crazy.
You've got something wrong in the head.
I'm normal.
There's nothing wrong with me.
It's frightening.
You'd better be careful.
What's wrong?
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm going home.
Farewell.
Please come again.
Nakasago soon took to the road again.
He wandered around like a gypsy,
leaving his wife all alone.
Where are you headed?
Where?
Oh, I've walked all the way.
Aren't you headed somewhere?
Never mind me.
It's going to rain.
Let's hurry!
But where?
Where are we going?
See, it's getting dark.
It'll be dark soon.
We'd better hurry.
Even the glass of the windows is bursting
Even the garden at the school...
It really is night already.
Even the glass of the windows is bursting
Even the garden at the school...
Who are those people?
Who?
Where?
On that bridge.
What are they doing?
They're watching fireworks.
Be careful.
Will you stay with me?
I really must go.
Then I shall escort you.
I was once beguiled by a fox on the road at night.
You're saying I'm a fox?
No, this just reminded me of it.
My apologies.
But you're right.
I could very well be a fox.
And you could very well be in the fox's den.
A place from which there is no escape.
Well, I never!
You look like you've seen a ghost.
Didn't you hear that?
It was just stones falling.
Where were they falling from?
Where did they fall from?
Did someone throw them?
Is someone in the garden?
No, there's no one out there.
Please don't leave!
There's no one here.
Please stay here with me just a little while longer.
I'll think it over.
I'm bored of Japan.
I'm getting married.
I've followed you this far.
But you have a wife.
Hey!
Hey!
So you're getting married?
Congratulations are in order!
You like my bones, don't you?
After my body's cremated, and they're pink, like pure cherry blossom.
You'll want them, won't you?
I know.
You caress me as if you were sucking my very bones.
I can tell.
Toyojiro Aochi Residence
Dean
Dean
What is it?
I can feel pain across my chest.
Look.
It's an allergy.
The plum tree in the garden...
It's so itchy!
Close the shutters.
That's why I asked you to cut it down last winter!
You know all about my allergy.
I'm allergic to pollen.
I have to be careful.
The doctor warned me.
It's so itchy!
Brother-in-law?
Yes, it's me.
Where's my sister?
She's ill.
It's her usual spring allergies.
I thought you were Nakasago.
Has he been to see you?
Yes, with my sister.
With my wife?
Is that true?
Yes.
It was a very windy day.
It's a miracle she's still alive.
The doctor's already given up.
But she still has her strength.
It might be better for her if she just died quickly.
Can she see?
They say she can't.
What's wrong?
A bit of dust...
Don't rub it.
You'll scratch your eye.
Come in the light.
Close your eyes.
Don't open them.
Just a little more.
That hurts.
She thought I couldn't see, so she just went ahead.
She thought it was a secret.
She really enjoyed it!
Are you still there?
Are you angry?
Why?
Because I've said too much.
I'm not angry.
This is proof you're getting better.
Brother...
What now?
Did you eat the cod eggs
I kept in the cupboard?
Yes. Thank you.
Were they good?
Yes, quite delicious.
I bought them especially for you.
I didn't want my sister to have them.
Who is it?
Who's there?
Who is it?
My husband is out.
I said he's not here!
Why are you making love to me now, when my body is so repulsive?
You're at your best.
Things are best when they begin to rot.
Hello!
How about lunch?
I was at your place.
Your wife said you were out.
So I headed back.
I see.
How was she?
Who?
My wife.
What did you talk about?
Nothing in particular.
I hate to say this, but...
...she's not my type.
She's far too rich.
Is that so?
Like a skeleton having sex on a tin roof.
What about your wife?
She's not great.
She's far too slight.
There's not much of her.
Bedding her is like chewing on vinegar.
I once took her from behind in the kitchen.
How was it?
In the kitchen.
Good sex.
At first she fought back, but then she hung on tight.
But afterwards she cried, regretting she wasn't
"one of my countryside geisha".
Stupid woman.
Do you treat everyone like that?
Like animals?
Your wife, the geisha O-lne...
And...
And what?
Go on. Spit it out.
You're right, after all.
I won't get angry.
Here. Come on.
How about we swap wives?
Swap wives?
Nakasago! Are you crazy?
Yes, I am.
Don't act so surprised!
I've been crazy my entire life.
You've known ever since we met.
Well, I guess that's true.
So you agree?
Enough of your jokes.
Skeletons.
They're the best.
The most beautiful human form.
Remove the skin and flesh that cover their pure beauty.
Then polish the bones.
Lately,
I felt that the more women I sleep with, the deeper I sink into a sea of flesh.
The bones beyond that sea look so pure and beautiful.
Bones are the ultimate flesh.
As beautiful as ivory?
No, ivory doesn't even come close.
But you might be right.
If I die,
I'll leave my bones to you.
My actual bones, unburnt.
But in return...
...if you die first,
I get your bones.
I'll make a beautiful skeleton out of you and put you on display.
That would please you, wouldn't it?
Agreed?
Are we agreed?
A few months later,
Mrs Nakasago had a baby girl.
Congratulations.
A girl, isn't it?
Her name's Toyoko.
It was my husband's choice.
You're his best friend.
He took part of your name for her.
Would you like to hold her?
He didn't tell you about naming her?
No, I didn't know.
I'm sorry.
He should've told you.
It's an imposition, isn't it?
No, not at all.
Please. Have a hold of her.
She's a big baby.
Yes, quite heavy.
Is Nakasago in?
Has he gone missing again?
He gives you a hard time.
Leaving so soon?
Yes. I have to go.
A little something for the baby.
Good bye.
The following year was marked by the Spanish Fly epidemic.
Nakasago carried it home with him.
His wife soon became infected.
She died before her baby was fully weaned.
I firmly believe that Nakasago deliberately killed her.
In mourning
She said...
...just before she died...
"if Mr Aochi comes, give him burdock root jelly."
And then she died.
Can Nakasago really take care of a child?
He has a wet nurse, right?
She ran away, I heard.
When she was suckling the baby, he came to her.
He wanted to suckle, too.
To remember the taste of milk.
He latched onto her breast.
Did he really?
Yes. Typical.
No wonder she ran off.
What's that you're eating?
A peach.
But it's rotten.
No, it's just on the verge of going off, which makes it sweet, like honey.
You wouldn't eat it, would you?
There's a stinging taste in the sweetness, like poison.
It's really delicious.
But aren't you allergic to the smell of flowers and fruit?
Strangely enough,
I'm not any more.
I've actually begun to love them.
Maybe my body has changed?
Did you ever visit...
...the hospital with Nakasago?
Which hospital?
Your sister's.
No, I didn't.
Did he say he went with me?
No.
So she did.
She just imagined it.
She isn't all there.
She sees things.
She can't tell what's real.
After all, she is very ill.
Look. A peeled peach is all wet and slippery.
So is a skinned human being, they say.
The inside of the spine is like threads of burdock, they say.
Although maybe not to your taste.
Have Nakasago and my wife visited again together?
Has Nakasago been here recently?
Na... ka... sa... go?
Who's that?
Don't you remember?
You said he came here with my wife.
She licked his eyes...
Brother...
What?
Did you eat the cod eggs
I bought for you?
Yes. Thank you.
Nakasago invited me over, saying he'd hired another nurse.
Hello, Mr Aochi. Welcome.
It's O-lne.
I thought she was a ghost.
This takes me back to the night we all met.
She had come back from a funeral and you forced her to dance.
I enjoyed that inn.
Those three blind beggars too.
Speaking of the beggars - please, have some.
You followed after them, right?
So what happened in the end?
What was it between them?
Nothing happened to start with.
They just kept walking, that way they did.
An interesting approach, right?
Neither could move around.
It's been a while since I had that much fun.
They really tried to kill each other?
The three of them got married.
Who do you mean?
The three blind beggars.
Married?
The three of them?
The young ones got rid of the old man first.
But they didn't know the roads.
The villagers beat them and pushed them into the river.
So all three got married?
They had no choice.
How else could they survive?
Didn't they kill each other?
Yes, they did.
That's not what she's saying.
They beat each other to death.
The woman was swept away.
I saw it all.
- Which is the truth?
- Don't ask me.
Anyway, I'm glad.
The three of us drinking together again.
I feel a sense of destiny in this.
Well said.
We're man and wife now.
This is our destiny.
You two got married?
I should've brought a gift.
Married? She's joking.
She's only a wet nurse.
She's my nurse, housekeeper and my geisha. She's convenient.
She just imagines that we're married.
Let her have her dream.
I see.
I envy you.
I don't mind.
I consider us a couple.
Play the shamisen!
I haven't heard you play for a while. Go on.
- It'll wake the baby.
- So what if she cries?
But...
...I left my shamisen at home.
Then send for the damn thing!
A geisha should have her shamisen!
You hear me?
Don't make me.
I'm no longer a geisha.
I gave it up.
You! Where are you going?
To meet my master
In spite of this cold weather
With all these attendants
Your attendants will surely be cold!
She's ruined the mood.
Let's go somewhere else.
We'll go find some other geisha.
All right, then.
I'll go by myself.
Being a man isn't easy!
I'm very sorry.
I wish you didn't have to see that.
- Devils out!
- Blessings come inside!
- Devils out!
- Blessings come inside!
I went to Hibiya to the Heifetz concert.
I heard that he was going
to play Zigeunen/veisen.
But I was so disappointed.
He didn't even play it.
Blessings come inside!
No one can compare to Sarasate's vision.
Blessings come inside!
Devils out!
Nakasago once again went wandering.
We are many hundred leagues from the capital
Life is hard here in the wilds of Manchuria
The red skirts of the whores are all we have to sate us
We pan' the skids and take our fill
For on the morrow we're off to war
And the bra vest of us all to battle gird our loins
Their women will swoon as we win our victory
The bravest of us are weary and lay down our heads
A real devil just passed by.
I thought he was going to eat us.
Is he still there?
Still at it, is he?
It's almost noon.
It is noon.
Excuse me, sir!
A call for Professor Aochi!
Hello, Aochi speaking.
My dear, I'm afraid
I have bad news for you.
It's about Nakasago...
The poor man's dead.
They found the body...
They found his body in the mountains.
Was it suicide?
According to the policeman, he was messing around with narcotics.
He took an overdose and suffocated.
Accidental death, they say.
Where's the body?
At his house.
The wake is tonight.
You'll have to go.
Can you come home as soon as possible?
I'm all alone here...
You're new here.
Are you waiting for someone?
Yes, the surgeon, Dr Amaki.
He called a little while ago.
He's running late.
That's him now.
Hello!
What's the time?
Five o'clock.
Shall we press on or shall we turn back
Beneath the aurora lights
Russia is a northern country, one that knows no bounds...
Are you busy?
Yes. I just finished an autopsy.
- Suicide?
- What?
- Your patient.
- No, it was a disease.
He died today at the clinic.
But it was unclear exactly why.
I had to do a complete dissection.
By the way, what brings you here?
That's OK.
Can you remove the skeleton from a human body?
I have the body.
Remove the skin and flesh and leave just the bones.
Is that possible?
Is this a joke?
No.
Can you do it?
Not a chance!
There's no medical basis for it.
Even if I could, I wouldn't.
Please forgive me.
I couldn't bring myself to attend the funeral.
I couldn't watch him turn to ashes.
I couldn't bear to see it.
I was a coward.
Forgive me.
That's all right.
He wouldn't have minded.
I'm sure he would have understood how you felt.
Go ahead.
Please take a look.
I'm sure he'd want you to.
No, I have no right.
They were white.
Ordinary, dry, white bones.
My wife is out.
She'll be along later.
The patient has regained her senses, but she won't survive much longer.
Awhile ago...
...Mr Nakasago came here.
He came to visit me.
He was wearing a black cape.
His hair was long and disheveled.
He stood there, staring at me.
Has he been again in the past few days?
He was with my sister.
You had the same dream, didn't you?
The same horrible dream as me.
Dream?
He made love to my sister in the dream.
Dream?
It's so strange...
I had the dream first.
But you stole it.
Taeko.
Five years passed.
Well...
Hello O-lne.
- And this young lady must be...
- Toyoko, Nakasago's daughter.
Pay your respects to Mr Aochi.
She was taking a nap when I heard her groan.
She groaned?
She looked so scared. I woke her up and was taking her for a walk.
I see.
But you'll find that children often react like that to bad dreams.
Is that so?
I have some business to attend to.
I'm glad I met you today.
It's been a long time.
Don't be a stranger.
Please come and visit sometimes.
Thank you.
We'll take our leave here.
What's the matter?
You look pale.
Didn't you sleep well?
On the contrary,
I sleep day and night.
Still, I'm always tired.
I wake up, drink some water that I keep by my pillow, and go back to sleep.
Speaking of that water, sometimes it disappears.
Because you drink it.
No, it's not that.
I wake up and reach for the glass, only to find that it's half empty.
You just forgot you drank some.
At first I thought so too.
But one time it was being poured over my face.
I woke up.
I touched my face, thinking it was just a dream.
But my face was soaking wet.
That was no dream.
Absolutely not.
So who did it?
The wind is rising.
It's blowing through dark places.
A Mrs Nakasago is here to see you.
That'll be O-lne.
What an event!
She's never visited us before.
- Send her in.
- Yes... but...
- What is it?
- She wishes to talk to you, sir.
The former geisha?
If you'll excuse me.
I'll go and take a peek.
What's the matter?
Why don't you come inside?
No, thank you.
This won't take long.
What won't take long?
Please return the book
Nakasago lent you.
Book?
I believe you have his
Sanders German-English Dictionary.
You're so lucky!
That's mine.
I can't believe you!
Property of Nakasago
Sorry, I forgot to return this.
You're right, I did borrow it.
How's Toyoko?
Is she doing well?
Yes, thank you.
Did you leave her at home?
No, she's here.
You must be cold out there.
Come inside.
I'll give you some sweets.
A few days later,
O-lne came around again.
Please return the book that Nakasago lent you.
Another book?
Yes. One of those philosophical primers.
Property of Nakasago
Here, I found it.
I think this is the last book of his that I have.
This is all a bit too strange for me.
How did O-lne know
I had Nakasago's books?
Perhaps he told her before he died.
He wasn't that careful with his books.
And they're all obscure, scholarly works.
How could a former geisha remember anything philosophical?
That is quite strange.
It's very strange.
Mrs Nakasago to see you.
And there was a call from the mistress.
She'll be home late.
I have a question to ask of your wife.
What is it?
I can ask her for you, if you don't mind.
Toyoko wakes up every night at the same time.
She seems to be awake but doesn't respond to me.
She appears to be speaking to Nakasago.
Your little girl?
Naturally, a girl may dream of her late father.
But this poor child...
She can't possibly have any memories of her father.
He passed away the very year she was born.
While she's speaking with him, your name is always mentioned.
What does she say?
I can't catch the exact words.
But I sense it's about something he loved that he'd loaned to you.
That's what it seems to be about.
I thought perhaps your wife would know what it is.
Why would she know?
Is that what he said in the dream?
No, that's just the feeling I had, that's all.
Did Nakasago ever come here while I was out?
When he was alive, of course.
No.
Wait, I remember.
Yes, once.
I said you were out, so he left.
Remember?
I was sick at the time.
You were visiting my sister at the hospital.
Why do you ask all of a sudden?
You don't like being asked?
No, it's not that.
But it does make me nervous.
I'm telling the truth but you obviously don't believe me.
Don't misunderstand me.
Nakasago might have been quite handsome, but he was crazy.
I didn't like being in his company.
In Toyoko's dream, he apparently said he'd given you something.
O-lne believes he was telling the truth.
She seems to think you'd know what it is.
I have no idea!
He never gave me anything!
He left a record here.
A record?
Zigeunen/veisen, performed by Sarasate.
I'm sorry. I can't find it.
Are you certain?
I've no recollection of even borrowing it.
I'm sure he left it here.
It's a ten-inch gramophone record.
I know what it is!
I just said that I couldn't find it.
If I do, I'll return it.
Is that so?
I wanted it.
Nakasago is surely back with his wife now.
He was that sort of man.
He never thought of me.
He never cared about me.
That makes me so upset.
I want every single thing of his in this world.
I want his things near me.
Yes, but...
That way he will always be with me.
Or so I thought.
But how do you know exactly which books of his I had?
That was strange.
I heard about them from Toyoko.
She talks when she's dreaming.
I listened very carefully.
You're lying.
He knows howl loved him.
Yet he still went back to her.
All I have left of him now is little Toyoko.
I love her because she's part of him.
I love her more than myself.
I'll raise her by myself.
I'll never let him have her.
It doesn't work right away.
Let it run and it will start.
Won't you come in here?
You've lost a friend.
You must miss him.
There's some beer here that Nakasago left.
Shall we party again, like we did?
Perhaps then he will finally notice me.
Where's Toyoko?
She's gone, hasn't she?
No!
She hasn't!
Toyoko, come here immediately!
Toyoko“.
Toyoko!
Toyoko“.
Ah. She's gone to school.
Don't leave so soon.
Stay here with me for a while.
You can't leave now, can you?
Who are you?
Just who are you?
Who?
Toyoko has gone to school.
She's at school.
Toyoko.
Give me your bones.
Why do you look so surprised?
My father is alive.
You're the ones who think you're alive, but you're dead.
Now! Give me your bones, like you promised.
Come with me.

WelI, if it isn't Deputy London keeping an eye on things.
Hi, guys.
Hi.
Hi, Pam.
Hi, Mark.
Well, I guess you don't need me anymore.
Where you goin'?
Uh, to drop these off.
The graduation edition?
Yeah. Wejust finished this morning.
You have a spare?
Yeah, but we had to print these very small, and I wouldn't want you to strain your eyes twice in one day.
Well, maybe you can read it to me over lunch.
Okay.
All right. I gotta stop by the office first though.
If I don't, the sheriffwill kill me.
They haven't had a graduation dance since 1 945... because Major Chatham wouldn't allow it.
Well, he'd stop it now if he could.
But he can't. Since the stroke, no one's even seen him.
You know, I feel sorry for him.
He's all alone in that house, so close to where he found his daughter and that boy.
State police called about an hour ago.
Somebody robbed a market up near Columbus.
Cut some kid up and took his car.
They think he may be headed this way.
Are you still gonna leave?
I can't start the summer without fishing.
You know that. I never could.
Besides, you've been here for two years now.
You can handle anything that might come along.
Here you go.
You were so anxious to read it before.
"Pam MacDonald."
I'm impressed.
Thankyou.
Check, please.
I guess with the, uh, sheriff leaving, you'll be on duty tonight, huh?
Yeah.
Oh.
I was hoping maybe you could come by the graduation dance a little later.
Well, maybe I can come by for a while.
Mark?
Hmm?
You don't think the guy who robbed that store might come here, do you?
I don't think so.
State police will get him soon.
Yeah, well, until they do, be careful.
Okay?
Hey, Pam. Over here.
Hi, Carl.
Hey. I read your article.

Don'tjust stand there.
Shut the door.
Aren't you gonna ask me in?
How fast can you take offyour clothes?
Start your stopwatch, coach.

Guess you've been around here longer than anyone.
Yeah. Fortyyears.
Good having the girls back.
Makes me feel young again.
Thanks for the dance.

It's all right.
- Deputy, that was fun.

[ Gasps ]
Mark!
What's wrong?
Oh, God.
What happened?
What happened?
It's all right. What's the matter?
Mark. Somebody was chasing me.
Somebody was chasing me, and Major Chatham grabbed me.
Major Chatham?
Uh-huh.
Mark, he hurt my arm.
What the hell was Major Chatham doing down here?
I don't know.
And he- And he chased you?
No. I don't know who chased me.
All I saw was, um, boots and some kind of uniform.
Are you okay?
All right, I'm gonna take a look around.
Myjeep's right there. Stay there.
I'll be right back.
Be right back.
[ Exhales ]
[ Gasps, Exhales ]
Did you find anything?
I found wheelchair marks and boot tracks too.
Did you look in the dorm?
No.
Here.
Mark, Sherry's in there.
Carl's with her.
Okay.
Let's go.
Where?
Major Chatham's.

Major Chatham!
Let's try around back.

Mark.
This is Francis Chatham.
I'm gonna take a look upstairs.
[ Stairs Creaking ]
Major Chatham?
[ Floor Creaks ]
[ Gasps ]
Oh, Mark, you scared me.
Everything's covered upstairs.
Chatham probably hasn't even been up there since his last stroke.
You find anything?
Look at this.
So what?
It's the major's daughter.
Francis Rosemary Chatham.
They must have called her Rose.
And look. See? I found a pressed rose in the yearbook.
And the killer left behind a rose in her hands.
Didn't you read my article?
They never found out who did it.
But it had to be someone in town, someone who knew that she was called Rose, and, Mark, that guy still might be around here.
Oh, man. I don't believe this.
You're talking about something that happened over 30 years ago.
Pam. The guy who chased you may be the one the state police are looking for right now.
I say let's get the hell out of here and go to the dance and see that everyone stays inside.
Maybe you should call the sheriff.
Thanks.
I'm sorry.
Okay. I didn't mean that.
It's all right.
Let's go. δδ [ Rock, Muffled ]
[ Retches ]
Paul, are you okay?
Oh- [ Coughs ]
God.
I think I'm gonna throw up again.

But I wanna see blood on the floorδ δ Standing in the spotlight
I hope I can see her bleed δ δ I want to see her bleed δ δ Don't turn offthe spotlight
I still want to see her bleed δ
Is Paul still in here?
Yeah. He's sick as a dog.
[ Coughs, Retches ]
I'm gonna go cool off, Paul.
When you get tired of hugging the toilet, you can find me up at Garner's pool. δ I'm lonely and I wanna go home alone δ
There she is. δ I'm lonely
Don't leave me alone δ
You mean there was someone actually in the dorm?
Are you sure you're all right?
I'm fine.
God. It must have been terrible.
I want you to tell everyone to stay put.
Right. I-I'll make an announcement right away. δδ [ Continues ]
[ Indistinct ] δδ [ Stops ]
Very important announcement to make.
Uh, is this thing on still?
Do you think-
Hello? Testing-
[ Blows ]
[ Feedback ]
Hello? Uh, attention.
Could I have your attention, please, ladies and gentlemen?
Uh, Deputy London hasjust informed me... that a prowler has been seen around the campus, and, uh-
Well, he could be dangerous.
Now, I know this won't be very popular, but I'm gonna have to ask... that everybody please stay in the building until we know more about this.
[ Groaning ]
Which shouldn't be too long, okay?
So everybodyjust relax and enjoy the dance and the music.
- [ Feedback ]
- Shit.
[ All Laughing ]
Oh. Thankyou.
Oh.
[ Toilet Flushes ]
I'll probably puke in the damn pool.
Psst!
Hi. I'm back.
Who turned offthe band?
Miss Allison just made an announcement.
There's some kind of prowler outside or something.
Maybe we should tell her Lisa left.
Nah. Paul will be with her.
She'll be okay.
[ Drumsticks Tapping ]
[ Man ]
One, two, three! δδ [ Rock ]
Hey, baby.
Let's struggle. Come on.
Wait a minute, Paul. You're gonna have to wait a while before you go outside.
For what?
Paul, hold on.
Just listen to me for a minute, okay?
What the fuck's goin' on here? δ Don't go δ
I don't give a shit about any goddamn prowler.
All right. Nowjust settle down!
Calm down, buddy.
Leave me alone!
Okay, okay.
I want this boy arrested!
We don't have to stand for this kind ofthing here.
I want him out of here!
Or am I gonna have to call the sheriff?
Oh, God.
This is stupid, man.
All right, look.
I'm gettin' him out of here. Okay?
Look. Can you handle everything here?
Come on! Come on.
[ Panting ]
[ Grunts ]
[ Gasping ]
[ Screaming ] δδ [ Continues ]
She's where?
Okay, I think that she went out to the pool, just to cool off.
See, it was before the announcement.
No, somebody's gonna have to go get her.
Ifyou see Mr. Turner, just tell him where I've gone.
Think I just got Lisa in trouble.
[ Laughing ]
[ Muttering ]
Paul.
Gonna slap the cuffs on me, chief?
Book 'em, Pam-o.
[ Chuckles ]
Lisa? δδ [ Continues, Loud ]
I am not going outside until they catch the prowler. That's it.
We don't have to go-
We don't have to go outside.
There's a perfect place down in the basement. I know it.
I mean, people here, they use it all the time for parties and stuff.
Ha! Right!
What kind of people?
Come on, Sally. It's great. I'll show you.
Come on. Come on.
Am I okay?
Yeah.
Yeah?
I thought you knew where this place was.
Ah, that's the beauty of it.
It's difficult to find.
That way, there's no chance of being interrupted.
[ Sally ]
Hang on.
[ Lights Clatter ]
Hey.
It's around here somewhere.

Hey! Warden!
We're bustin' out of here at midnight!
You can't keep me in here!
What are you charging him with?
Disturbing the peace.
Hey, you can't keep me in here.
My boys will spring me as soon as they hear about this.
Hey! Keep it down in there!
Ooh! Look out, boys!
The marshal's comin' with his rubber hose!
Paul, shut up!
[ Soft Footsteps ]
[ Floorboard Creaks ]
I heard something.
[ Sniffles ]
It was probablyjust the wind.
In the basement?
Hmm?
[ Chuckling ]
Basement!
Why don't we check out the dorm again?
You don't think he'd still be there, do you?
It's all we have to go on.
Oh, but Mark, what about Major Chatham?
I'm not gonna break into the man's house twice in one night.
Well. Lookee here.
Now, George left you in charge here.
Can't you keep them kids under control?
What are you doing here, Kingsley?
It's that damn graduation thing.
We haven't had any trouble out ofthat college for more than 30 years, and... now they have to start that damn thing over again.
- What do you mean?
- There's a bunch of kids over there in the cemetery.
I know what they're doin' in there.
Now, what are they doing in there, Kingsley?
Hell, it was dark.
I couldn't see anything.
Well, ifyou couldn't see anything, why don't you just go home?
Sure.
But that gate was wide open.
[ Footsteps Sloshing ]
The gate's supposed to be locked at night.
I wonderwhat he was doing wandering around down there.
[ Crickets Chirping ]
[ Engine Stops ]
[ Exhales ]
Watch the road.
I'm gonna see what I can find out there, okay?
Okay.
[ Footsteps ]
[ Screaming ]
Mark!
Mark! Mark! Mark.
I saw somebody.
I think it was Otto Hahn!
I- H-He was looking at me through the window.
I found an open grave out there.
It's been opened.

[ Whimpering ]
Oh, Lisa.
[ Sobbing ]
No!
No!
[ Pam Sobs ]
[ Crying ]
[ Phone Ringing ]
[ Ringing Continues ]
- Ocoee Lodge.
- Hello, yeah. Uh, could I please speak to Sheriff George Fraser?
He should have checked in today.
Well, I just come on an hour ago.
Let me check and see what cabin he's in. δδ [ Humming ]
Look, buddy. This is an emergency.
I need to get in touch with him right away.
He's in, uh...
Lake Cabin Number 7.
Most everybody's asleep now.
Uh-huh.
Well, why don't I just run out and get him?
[ Clatters ]
[ Dog Barking In Distance ]
[ Exhales ]
[ Spits ]
[ Clatters ]
He ain't in his cabin.
Well, do you know where he went?
I told you. I just come on an hour ago.
I ain't seen him.
I know a bunch of'em were goin' night fishing for crappie up in, uh-
Oh, shoot. Where were they going? Uh-
Look, could you take a message?
Yeah. I could take a message.
Wait till I get a pencil.
[ Scoffs ]
[ Sighs ]
All right. Shoot.
Yeah. Tell him to call Mark London.
Tell him to get in touch with me right away.
All right. I'll tell him.
Bye.
[ Handset Settles In Cradle ]
[ Sighs ]
Mark? Mark, who are you calling?
State police.
[ Dialing ]
Yeah. This is Deputy Mark London from Avalon Bay.
Could I please speak to Captain Jenkins?
Yeah, I'll hold.
[ Snoring ]
[ Cartridges Clattering ]
When will they be here?
Less than halfan hour.
They caught the man who robbed the store three hours ago.
He couldn't have killed Lisa.
That was Rose Chatham's grave we found, wasn't it?
I don't know.
Mark, the same man who killed her killed Lisa. δδ [ Band: Rock ]
[ Engine Stops ]
Why are we stopping here?
I want you to go inside and see ifeverything's under control.
All right?
All right. I'll be right back.
Pam?
I want you to stay at the dance.
What?
I'm going up to Chatham's alone.
Mark, that doesn't make any sense.
I don't wanna drag you around anymore, okay?
Drag me around?
What are you talking about?
[ Engine Starts ]
I'm sorry.
All right. That's fine, Mark!
You just go play sheriff, all right?
[ Exhales ]
Let's go.
[ Engine Stops ]
I'm going upstairs.
Mark?
Mark!
What happened?
I don't know!
[ Switch Clicking ]
[ Floorboards Creaking ]
Must be the fuse.
I'll go down and check it.
[ Screams ]
No! No!

It's a sunny, woodsy day in Lumberton,
so get those chain saws out.
This is the mighty W-O-O-D, the musical voice of Lumberton.
At the sound of the falling tree...
...it's 9:30!
There's a whole lot of wood waitin' out there, so let's get goin'.
Mr. Beaumont?
Your son Jeffrey's here to see you.
7894.
Hey, Dad.
Um, do you have a Detective Williams still working here?
Yes, he's up in Room 221.
Right up the stairs, through that door.
Thanks.
Detective Williams?
Yes?
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont.
I live near you.
I believe you know my father,
Tom Beaumont?
Beaumont's Hardware Store?
Sure, I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How's he doing?
He's okay, I guess. I hope.
They're doing tests.
That's why I'm home from school.
Anyway, I was at the hospital this morning, and coming home through the field, behind our neighborhood, there behind Vista,
I, uh... found an ear.
You did? A human ear?
Yeah. I thought I should bring it to you.
Yeah, that's right.
Let's take a look at it.
Yes, that's a human ear, all right.
Let's take it down to the coroner's office and see what they make of it.
Then I want you to show me exactly where you found it.
All right.
We'll check the morgue records, but I don't recall anything coming in minus an ear.
The person may very well still be alive somewhere.
What can you tell about the person from the ear?
Well, once the tests are done, quite a lot.
Sex, blood type, whether or not the ear came off a dead person.
Also, it looks like the ear was cut off with scissors.
- I'm goin' out for a while.
- Do you want the car?
- No, I'm just gonna walk around.
- All right.
Oh, Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
No, I'm just gonna walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
Okay, honey.
Hello. My name is Jeffrey Beaumont.
Is Detective Williams here?
Oh, yes. Yes, Jeffrey, come on in.
Thanks.
Well, now, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us.
Very interesting.
I know you must be curious to know more.
But I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you not only not to tell anybody about your find, but also not to ask more about the case.
One day when it's all sewed up,
I'll let you know all the details.
Right now, though, I can't.
I understand.
I'm just real curious, like you said.
I was the same way myself when I was your age.
I guess that's what got me into this business.
Must be great.
It's horrible too.
I'm sorry, Jeffrey.
That's the way it has to be.
Anyway, I know you do understand.
Sure.
- Thanks for the card for my dad.
- Oh, you're welcome.
- It was nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
- You too.
- Say hello to Sandy for me.
- We will.
Okay.
Good night, Jeffrey.
Good night, Detective Williams.
Are you the one that found the ear?
How did you know?
I just know, that's all.
- I remember you from Central.
- Oh, yeah?
- Are you a senior?
- Yup.
- How is Central these days?
- Terrible.
- I don't know. Boring.
- Yeah. What else is new, right?
Really. So what are you doin' now?
Uh, I'm home from school.
My father's in the hospital.
- That's too bad.
- Yeah.
So, what do you know about the ear?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?
Yeah, but you brought it up.
- You know anything?
- I don't know much but bits and pieces.
- I hear things.
- Yeah?
My room is right above my father's office, so...
Above your father's office?
- So I heard a few things about the ear.
- Uh-huh. And?
Well... there are a couple of cases
I get mixed up on.
Hmm?
But one name that keeps coming up is this woman singer.
She lives in an apartment building that is real close to your house.
It's also close to the field where you found the ear.
It's a strange world, isn't it?
Yeah.
Do you know where this woman's apartment building is?
Yeah. It's really close by.
That's what's so creepy.
They had her under surveillance for a couple of months,
'cept I don't know what they found out
'cause she's not my dad's case, so...
I, uh, guess you gotta get back home pretty soon, huh?
Mmm, not really. Why?
Well, um...
You wanna see the building.
Yeah.
- Come on. I'll show you.
- Okay.
Hey, baby. Hey, babe.
That's her building right there.
She lives on the seventh floor.
Come on.
So... uh, what are you gonna do now that you're home?
I've gotta help out at my father's hardware store.
They're giving me my own hours, which is nice.
I used to know a kid that lived there.
Had the biggest tongue in the world.
What happened to him?
I don't know.
He moved away.
All my old friends are gone.
You know the chicken walk?
What's that?
That's kind of interesting.
- Coffee time.
- Yo!
Hey, Double Ed, where are the overalls?
They're on the bottom shelf, rolled up, where they've always been.
Hey, Ed, how many fingers?
Four.
I still don't know how you do that.
Now listen. You sure you don't need me or this rig for a while?
Well, if you wanna spray for bugs,
Jeffrey, it causes us no pain.
Okeydokey, Double Ed.
- Oh, it's so good to have you back.
- Yeah, sure.
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
I don't know.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
Wait just a minute.
Listen. Don't you guys dare say anything to Mike, all right?
- Sure.
- It's not what you think, okay?
- Promise?
- Whatever you say.
I don't wanna cause any trouble.
I'm here, aren't I?
- Yeah, he is nice-lookin'.
- Yeah.
You ever been to Arlene's?
Of course.
Now, are you gonna tell me why we're here?
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience.
Sometimes it's necessary to take a risk.
Now, I got to thinking,
I'll bet someone could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment.
You know, sneak in, hide, and observe.
- Sneak into her apartment?
- Yeah.
Are you crazy?
Jeffrey, she's possibly involved in murder.
- This is givin' me the creeps.
- Now just settle down.
I have a plan which I think will work.
There's very little for you to do, but I do need your help.
Don't you even wanna hear the plan?
Well, you can tell me any plan you want, but it's not going any further than this diner.
Sandy, don't take that attitude.
All right.
The first thing I need is to get into her apartment and open a window that I can crawl into later.
How are you gonna do that?
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug-spraying rig.
I will go to her apartment.
I will be the pest-control man.
I will spray her apartment.
After a few minutes, you knock on the door, drawing her attention away from me, at which time I will then jimmy a window.
And what am I supposed to say when she comes to the door?
You will be a Jehovah's Witness.
I have some Awake! magazines for you.
I don't need very much time.
Just a few seconds.
What do you think?
I don't know.
I mean, it sounds like a good daydream, but... actually doing it's too weird.
It's too dangerous.
Sandy, let's just try the first part.
No one will suspect us because no one would think two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
You have a point there.
Give me at least three minutes from when I'm through the door.
I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window. All right?
All right.
Let's go.
Here I go.
Wait a minute. What's her name?
Oh, brother, Jeffrey.
Dorothy Vallens, seventh floor.
Look on her mailbox for the number, bright boy.
Thanks.
Dorothy Vallens, seventh floor.
Okay. Good luck.
Good luck yourself.
Three minutes. No sooner.
Yes? What is it?
Pest control. I gotta do your apartment.
That stuff stinks.
Well, this is new stuff.
There's no smell.
Good.
Just need to do the kitchen.
Grand Central Station.
It's only the bug man.
- That should do it.
- Yeah?
Are you all right?
Yeah. What happened?
Well, I was just about to go to the door when that guy did my job for me.
- Was it all right?
- Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
I only saw his back.
It sounded like he went out a door at the end of the hall.
Yeah. I didn't get a very good look at him either, but he sure looked at me.
I didn't have time to get a window, but I found these keys.
It's pretty nifty, huh?
Yeah, if they open the door.
Yeah.
So, what's next?
Are you game for more?
I owe you one since I goofed this one up.
You didn't goof it up.
But... you still owe me one.
I'm gonna try and sneak in tonight.
It's Friday. Do you have a date?
Yeah. I do.
Well, that does that.
You really wanna do this, don't you?
I don't want you to get involved.
I do, but if something went wrong...
Like you said, they may be involved in murder.
Okay. I'll tell Mike I'm sick.
Just so the record is kept straight, though,
I love Mike.
What do you want me to do?
Well, first we'll have a really nice dinner.
Try to find out where Dorothy Vallens sings.
I already know.
It's the Slow Club on Route 7.
Great. I'll pick you up about 8:00?
Uh, yeah. But don't pick me up.
My dad might think it's strange.
I'll walk over to your house.
I'll be there at eight o'clock. Okay?
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
Okay.
See ya!
Wait.
Here's to an interesting experience, huh?
I'll drink to that.
Man, I like Heineken.
You like Heineken?
Uh, well, I never really had a Heineken before.
You never had Heineken before?
My dad drinks Bud.
Ah. King of beers.

Jeffrey, you shouldn't do this.
Why not?
'Cause it's crazy.
And dangerous.
- My God, I should have never told you.
- I'll be all right.
I don't think you should stay here though.
I think you should go home.
Can you drive this car?
- Yeah, but I just...
- Well, leave it in front of your house for me, okay?
Okay.
I'll see ya tomorrow, and I'll tell ya how it went.
I don't wanna see you tomorrow.

What are you doing in my apartment,
Jeffrey Beaumont?
I wanted to see you.
Are you kidding? Who sent you here?
- Nobody.
- I've seen you before.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key.
I didn't mean to do anything except see you.
What did you see tonight?
Tell me!
I saw you come in.
I saw you talk on the phone.
- And then?
- You got undressed.
Do you sneak in girls' apartments to see them get undressed?
No, never before this.
Get undressed. I want to see you.
Look, I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
No way! I want to see you! Get undressed!
Stand up.
Come closer.
Closer.
What do you want?
I don't know.
Don't move. Don't look at me.
- Do you like that?
- Yes.
Don't touch me, or I'll kill you!
Do you like talk like that?
No.
Get over there on that couch.
Lie down.
Shut up! Don't say anything.
Go hide in the closet.
Don't say anything, or I'll kill you.
I mean it.
- Hello, baby.
- Shut up!
It's Daddy, you shithead!
Where's my bourbon?
Can't you fuckin' remember anything?
Now it's dark.
Spread your legs.

You stay alive, baby.
Do it for Van Gogh.
Why don't you lie down?
Come on. I'll help you.
I don't like that.
- What do you want?
- Nothing.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
I'm all right.
I'll go then.
Don?
- Oh, Don!
- No.
Oh, Don, hold me. Hold me.
I'm scared. I'm scared.
I'm scared.
It's okay. It's okay.
Don? Don?
Are you back?
Do you like me?
- Do you like me?

Do you like the way I feel?
Yes.
See my breast?
You can feel it.
My nipple... is getting hard.
You can touch it.
You can feel it.
Do you like the way I feel?
Yes.
Feel me.
Hit me.
No.
Dorothy, no. Stop it.
Hit me.
Hit me.
Hit me!
I'm leaving now.
Torned.
Torned.
Help me.
Oh, my God. That hat.
She's married.
"Don."
Help me.
Now it's dark.
Hit me. Hit me.
Man, oh, man.
- Sandy, can you talk?
- Uh-uh. Mike's here.
Oh, he is.
I guess I'll talk to you later then.
Well, how'd it go?
It went okay. I'll tell you about it.
I'll pick you up at 8:00.
New ax, 48721.
I'll see you then.
- Okay, great.
- Bye-bye.
Bye.
Well?
Aren't you gonna tell me about it?
Okay.
It's a strange world, Sandy.
Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don.
They have a son.
I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank.
Frank has done this to force Dorothy to do things for him.
I think she wants to die.
I think Frank cut the ear I found off her husband as a warning for her to stay alive.
Frank is a... is a very dangerous man.
My God.
- Should you tell my father?
- No. I can't do that.
I can't prove any of this.
I found out my information illegally.
You could get into a lot of trouble.
You saw a lot in one night.
It is a strange world.
Why are there people like Frank?
Why is there so much trouble in this world?
I don't know.
I had a dream.
In fact, it was the night I met you.
In the dream, there was our world... and the world was dark because there weren't any robins.
And the robins represented love.
And for the longest time, there was just this darkness.
And all of a sudden, thousands of robins were set free.
And they flew down and brought this blinding light of love.
And it seemed like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference.
And it did.
So I guess it means... there is trouble till the robins come.
You're a neat girl.
So are you.
I mean... you're a neat guy.
Uh, I guess we better go.
Yeah. I guess so.
Hi. May I come in?
Yes.
Hurry, though.
Are you all right?
No, I'm not.
Why are you here?
- What do you want?
- I, uh...
I looked for you in my closet tonight.
It's crazy, I know.
I don't know where you come from, but...
I like you.
It's not crazy. I like you too.
I liked being with you last night.
Same here.
Please be with me. Be with me, please.

- Sandy?
- All right.
Oh, great.
- You're late.
- I'm sorry.
- What am I gonna do now?
- You wanna go talk to him?
Yeah, but...
I don't think it's gonna do much good.
- Let's just go. I'll try to talk to him later.
- Okay.
One!
See that clock on the wall?
Yeah.
Five minutes from now, you're not gonna believe what I've told you.
Number one:
Today I staked out Frank's place with a camera.
Now, there's another man involved in all this.
I call him the Yellow Man.
You saw his back the other day at Dorothy's apartment.
Today I saw the Yellow Man go into
Frank's building, laughing with Frank.
Now, the only trouble is, what does that prove?
Nothing, really, but it's interesting.
Number two:
I saw the Yellow Man come out and meet up with a well-dressed man carrying an alligator briefcase.
They went to this factory building downtown, stood on a staircase and looked off in the distance.
Now get this.
In the distance, there was a murder.
This drug dealer was shot to death and a woman had her legs broken.
Jeffrey.
Then these two guys told me that the police would find a huge amount of drugs in the dead dealer's place.
I can't believe what you're finding out.
Are you gonna continue with this?
Yeah.
Until when? I mean, what are you gonna do with this stuff?
Well, I don't know.
You're not going back to her apartment?
Yeah.
Jeffrey, why?
I'm seeing something that was always hidden.
I'm involved in a mystery.
I'm in the middle of a mystery.
And it's all secret.
You like mysteries that much?
Yeah.
You're a mystery.
I like you... very much.
Oh, yeah?
Jeffrey. Don't, please.
You worry about me, really?
Yeah.
Is that so surprising?
Yeah, I worry... a lot.
I got you into this.

What do you want to do?
I'm doing it.
Are you a bad boy?
What do you mean?
Do you wanna do bad things?
Anything.
Anything.
What do you want?
I want you to hurt me.
No. I don't want to hurt you.
I told you, I want to help you.
Dorothy, I know some of what's happening.
Frank has your husband and son, doesn't he?
Dorothy, you gotta do something... go to the police or...
No police.
No police.
Don! Hit me!
No! No!
Get away! Get away from my bed!
Get away!
I have your disease in me now.
He used to make me laugh.
I'm sorry, Dorothy.
I should go.
Yes.
You think I'm crazy, don't you?
I want you to stay.
Don't hate me.
Oh, I sure don't hate you.
I'm not crazy.
I know the difference between right and wrong.
That's good.
You're my special friend.
I still have you inside of me.
It helps me.
I need you.

Would you excuse us all for a moment, please?
Excuse us, por favor.

Jeffrey, what do you mean, you're lucky to be able to call me?
Things got a little out of hand.
I know some things. They could help your father, but you might get into trouble.
Look, forget me. You've got to tell him.
Okay.
I promise I won't mention you.
Jeffrey, I mean it. It doesn't matter.
Good. I'll see you Friday, if not before.
- Okay.
- Good.
- Bye-bye, Sandy.
- Bye.
- I don't want to talk about it.
- But...
Everything is okay now.
I just don't want to talk about it.
But sometimes it's good to talk things over, Jeffrey.
For instance, they say that many marriages...
Aunt Barbara...
I love you, but you're gonna get it.
Gordon.
Gordon went right up to 'em in broad daylight, of course, 'cause he's the man, right?
And he took all those drugs away, and it was beautiful.
I got it.
- Jeffrey. Come on in.
- Jeffrey?
Hi, Sandy.
Hi, Jeffrey.
I'm sorry to bother you, but I need to talk to you.
Okay. Looks like you had a bad face-lift.
- Yeah.
- Come on into my study.
I have to show you some photos and tell you some things about them.
This is the first picture.
It's Frank Booth.
He is a very sick and dangerous man.
His address is on the back of the photo.
This photo is of Frank and another man as they went into Frank's building.
And then that man came out and met with a third man.
This well-dressed guy. Here's that photo.
I think a woman named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people.
I think Frank kidnapped her husband and son.
I have no hard proof of any of this.
- Is Sandy part of this?
- Oh, no. No.
Who else knows you have these photos?
Just you and the photo lab.
- And you're through with this business now?
- Yes, sir, I am.
For now, all right, you better be.
And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you.
Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Yes, sir.
Is everything okay?
Yeah. Is Friday still on?
- You didn't tell him about me?
- No.
Why did I ever get you going on this,
Jeffrey?
- Of course Friday's still on.
- Great. See you then.
Good night, Detective Williams.
- Night, Sandy.
- Good night, Jeffrey.
Dad?
What's wrong?
There'd better be nothing wrong.
Looks like it's straight.
- Okay. I'll get it.
- Okay, thanks.
- Good evening, Jeffrey. Come on in.
- Thanks, Mrs. Williams.
- She's all ready.
- Okay.
You look great.
Thanks.
- Hello, Detective Williams.
- Hello, Jeffrey.
- You all set?
- Almost.
Hey, John, get a move on.
Just a minute, Tom.
Easy does it, Jeffrey.
Behave yourself.
Don't blow it.
Come on, John. Get it in gear, pal.
So long, Jeffrey.
- You two have a nice time tonight, okay?
- Okay.
What's going on?
Just a little fatherly advice.
That's right, Jeffrey.
Come on.
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.
Good night, Mom.
Bye. Have a good time.
- Night, Sandy.
- Good night, Tom.
Jeffrey, what was that all about?
It's nothing.
Really.
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
Hi.
Just a minute.
- Lookin' good!
- Thank you.
- It's all taken care of.
- Okay.
Um, you want something to drink?
Want to dance?
Yeah.

I can't outrun this guy.
- My father's got a gun at home.
- Jeffrey, no.
Sandy, this guy's a killer, I promise you.
It's Mike! Jeffrey, it's Mike. Oh, my God.
Oh.
Whoo! Get him, Mike!
Get outta the car!
Come on! Get outta there!
You stole my girl, you bastard.
Now I'm gonna kick your ass. Come on!
Right here, right in front of your own stupid house.
- Get outta here!
- Mike, stop it.
Shut up! Just shut up, all right?
Nobody's talkin' to you, all right?
- Come on.
- Mike, look, I don't wanna cause any problems.
Who's that, huh? Is that your mother?
That your mother?
- Dorothy.
- That your mother, Jeffrey?
- No, come here, you Ivy League shit.
- I gotta take care of someone who's hurt, in case you didn't notice.
Dorothy Vallens?
Come on.
I'm really... Hey, I... I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
- I di... I didn't know. I'm really sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay.
I thought you were gonna kill him, man.
We've gotta get her out of here.
Take her to my house. My father can get an ambulance faster than anyone.
His partner won't be there, will he?
- No, probably not. Why?
- Nothing.
Watch out for Mike.
Oh, God.
Is that you, Jeffrey?
Yeah. It's me.
Oh, Jeffrey.
Jeffrey.
Dad? Mom?
- I'm in here, honey.
- Mom?
All right, I'll be right there.
Is Dad home?
No. He oughta...
You better call him.
And, uh, get an ambulance.
Where have you been?
Oh, God.
Oh, God, they've hurt him.
Oh, Jeffrey! Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me!
- Hold me! Hold me!
- It's okay, it's okay.
- Oh, God.
- It's okay. Shh. It's okay.
My secret lover.
I've called for an ambulance, and the police are on their way.
Don't get the police!
Stop it!
I love you! Love me!
He put his disease in me.
Tell me it's all right
I opened myself to you.
- Tell me it's all right. It's all right.
- Sandy, please.
Sandy?
I'll get a coat to put on her.
Jeffrey?
- What's going on here?
- I'll tell you.
They... They've hurt his head.
Who, Dorothy?
Don.
Help him.
Help him.
Promise me you'll help him!
Okay.
He put his disease in me.
Would you like to come with us in the ambulance or take your own car?
I'll be right with you.
I should go.
- Go.
- Sandy.
Hold me! I'm falling!
I'm falling! Hold me!
You lied to me.
Sandy, please, forgive me.
I love you.
I forgive you, Jeffrey.
I love you.
God, I love you.
I-I...
But I couldn't watch that.
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, she's okay.
Listen, get ahold of your father.
Tell him to send the police over to Dorothy's apartment right away.
Tell him to hurry. I'm leaving right now.
- Jeffrey, no.
- I have to.
- I love you.
- Oh, God, be careful.
I will. Believe me.
Where is...
Where is my dream?
Look, this is an emergency.
He said someone was hurt, and he wants Detective Williams there.
We do not know his whereabouts at this time.
Well, find him!

Yeah, it's me. Listen, I'm hiding in Dorothy Vallens' apartment.
Frank is on his way up here in the well-dressed-man disguise.
I've got no way out. He...
He's got a radio.
Jeffrey!
Detective Williams?
I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Please hurry.
Hey, neighbor.

Well, she's up against the register
With an apron and a spatula
Yesterday's deliveries
And tickets for the bachelors
She's a moving violation
From her conk down to her shoes
Well, it's just an invitation
To the blues
And you feel just like Cagney
She looks like Rita Hayworth
At the counter of the Schwab's drugstore
You wonder if she might be single
She's a loner
Likes to mingle
Got to be patient
Try and pick up a clue
She said "How you gonna like 'em?"
Over medium or scrambled
You say, "Any way's the only way"
Be careful not to gamble
Oh, Stefan, I'm sorry.
You will call, hmm?
It's not really like going away.
For you.
Oh, Alex. I've done something stupid.
Alex?
- Oh, God, I'm tired.
- Tired or drunk?
I wanted to say good-bye.
You said it exceptionally well the other night.
That's right. Pissed.
- Milena, what do you...
- How else could I get myself ready?
God, good-bye, you...
Oh, Alex, please don't go.
I wanted us to have a real good-bye.
Alex?
- You the husband?
- No.
- A relation?
- No.
Any idea what she took?
- Was this full before?
- I wouldn't know, Doctor.
This'll kill you in the end.
If we're gonna meet, might as well be now.
Could be right.
Then again, why spoil the mystery?
Mystery?
If we don't meet, there's always the possibility it could have been perfect.
Hey, Alex. Alex, come on.
To tell you the truth,
I'm not sure what I meant.
- It's okay.
- Excuse me.
Took you a little longer than I thought.
I'm afraid it's gonna take a little longer than that. I'm leaving.
Road's wet.
It wasn't raining when I got here.
No?
Too bad.
If you'll let me by,
I'll drive carefully.
If that's the way you like it.
- Are you gonna let me by?
- Hmm?
Wrote my number on it.
Call me.
Please.
Bye.
Bye.
- Husband?
- No.
- Relation?
- No.
Boyfriend?
Look... what connection do you have with her?
You could say I'm a friend.
Oh.
Were you there when she swallowed the pills?
- No.
- Please, this way.
Ja. Good.
Please sit down.
And, uh... how did you happen to be there afterwards?
- Did somebody call you?
- She did.
What, the girl?
Yes, she phoned.
- After she took the pills or before?
- How would I know?
She called and said, "I'll be dead in a minute. I wanted to say good-bye."
- That's all?
- That's all.
And what did you say?
- Did you try to...
- Nothing. I hung up.
Cigarettes?
Thanks. I only smoke these.
Oh, Alex, it's true this time.
I've done something stupid.
Really stupid.
Milena, what are you...
What time did she phone you?
- I don't remember.
- Try to think.
Did you go to bed? Were you asleep?
No. I was working.
- Was it very late?
- I told you, I don't remember.
I didn't look at the clock.
Use whatever time you want.
It is now 2:00.
You called for the ambulance at half past 1:00?
How did her voice sound on the phone?
Normal?
Upset?
Did she have any difficulty speaking?
I don't.
- But...
- No, it's just that...
I wanted to see you.
This was the only chance I got.
I didn't want to wait.
You tell the truth about a lie beautifully.
Take me to your favorite place in Vienna.
Oh...
Who is this Linden?
The fellow who brought her here.
- Bit of a pain. Bad temper.
- Why?
You combine that with traces of various drugs, none of them harmful enough in themselves... but with the overdose she consumed tonight you have a very advanced toxic condition.
This place is... I mean, really!
I want it! Alex!
- It's mine!
- Give it to me!
- How does it work?
- I'll show you.
No, no! Come on. Where are they?
- Cards are in the back.
- Here they are.
But you need a neutral field. This is not really good. That's why we need to go home.
Here. Do it here. No, I don't wanna go.
We have to do it now, right...
Pick your favorite color, the one you're most sympathetic to.
- And the second.
- Okay. Here. All right. Got it.
- Slow down.
- No, no, I already know which ones I want.
- I like... this one.
- Don't associate it with anything.
- This one.
- Slow down.
- Turn 'em over now.
- Okay.
There. There. What does it mean?
- Hang on.
- Tell me! I wanna know right now, Alex.
- Just a second.
- Tell me!
- Tell me! What does it say?
- Hang on. Hang on.
- What?
- Mmm!
What? Tell me!
Is it bad?
I don't think you should spend too much time alone.
Oh, Alex!
"What is it men in women do require?
"The lineaments of gratified desire.
"What is it women do in men require?
The lineaments of gratified desire."
- That's good. I like that.
- I like that.
Gotta take a pee.
In all the old familiar places
That
This heart of mine embraces
All day through
Alex, come here. I wanna try something.
Like them. They're happy.
That's because they don't know each other well enough yet.
Oh, come on.
You don't really believe that, do you?
What does it matter?
Definitely happy. At least I hope so.
Twice?
That's good.
Once when I was 18. Again last year.
Shit.
Both times I... I wanted a child, but... at the last minute I changed my mind.
And how do you feel about it now?
It's done. I did what I chose.
And the fathers?
The first was happy.
The second... he was mad at me.
Oh, God, I've spilled it all over.
It hurts! Oh, God.
Maybe we could get something at the café.
Let's. It's burning my pussy, Alex.
Gonna have to do something about this, quickly.
All right.
Let me just turn off the road.
You're hung like an ape, Konrad.
You belong in a zoo.
Du bist. It's always you who makes me do this.
You know how dainty I am.
Move on, Konrad. Move on.
- Asshole.
- I suppose he has one.
Who are they?
- Oh, friends, crazy people.
- In what way?
They do crazy things.
Anyway, you're sexy. That's better!
Could you comment on sex with crazy people?
Eurgh. Cold.
How come you're so cold?
Yes, but I'm referring to the whole manifestation of curiosity.
You see, through the gratification of curiosity one acquires knowledge.
- Could you tell me if Dr. Linden is here?
- Yes. In the library.
Will you tell him Miss Flaherty is here to see him?
- Of course, my dear.
- Thank you.
- Moment.
- I'll be in the other room.
One would ask the question, what is a kiss?
And the answer is merely an inquiry on the second floor as to whether the first is free.
- But it's really simplis...
- Excuse me, Dr. Linden.
- There's a young lady to see you.
- Thank you.
Excuse me.
No. No, you can't...
Tell me, Doctor, is there any chance for us?
- No.
- No? Come here, you!
Clear.
I've just been drinking.
Fuck.
For practice, I mean.
Yeah.
Why?
What?
Yeah, why? What?
- She's been drinking a lot, hasn't she?
- The past few months, maybe.
Please wait there.
God, prices today.
A ticket to Fidelio...
Who could afford it?
Poor, silly girl.
How old is this girl?
Just a question.
Twenty-four... five.
Nice age.
She had difficulty speaking?
She seemed normal.
Sounded like a joke.
But it wasn't normal.
How do you know?
- Someone rings you...
- They ring you. They telephone me.
Sorry. I'm a little tired.
Yes.
Someone rings you, says she's going to kill herself... now, that isn't normal.
At least for normal people.
Would you agree?
I've spent a good part of my life trying to understand what normal means.
I still don't.
Would you say she sounded... excited?
Say whatever you like.
No, Dr. Linden, what you would like.
Excited.
What area do you work in,
Dr. Linden? Surgery?
No. I'm a research psychoanalyst.
- Research?
- I teach.
Was your girlfriend a bit mad?
"Mad" is an expression I never use.
I see.
It's quite simple.
If you say so.
Yes, but I must first know who I am before I know what I'm capable of.
How we come into this world and how we go out... is different for every one of us.
We are constantly in isolation... watching... spying on everyone and everything around us.
In birth, chance seems to be merely the visible part of an as-yet unknown... and uncomprehended natural law... which links us up with the central area of today's inquiry... secrecy and spying, or... call it what you will... watching.
So I give you the first spy.
And the first to be spied on.
Some famous spies... two of whom might be called political voyeurs.
Could you not as well put your picture up there, or mine?
- I could.
- Then you are saying we are all spies?
Well, I prefer to label myself... an observer.
Now, the guilt-ridden voyeur is usually a political conservative.
Anyway, I had time to think about it, and I feel I was wrong.
I wanted to apologize... for being too nosy.
Hey, I want to apologize too.
Guess I did get a little... tipsy.
Yeah, you did.
I don't want to embarrass you, Alex.
I do things when I drink too much.
I guess I think you're not happy with me anymore.
It makes me nervous.
Still seeing that actor?
Let's get some air.
I'm not seeing him or anyone.
I just went out with him a couple times. Once or twice.
Maybe three times.
You don't own me, I don't own you.
You are seeing him.
Is that why you called... to apologize?
I missed you.
Missed you too.
It's just, I can't stand these dumb arguments anymore, Alex.
Move in with me.
You'll see. It'll be great.
Can't.
But we've been practically living together.
Maybe later.
Why can't we get it back to how it was in the beginning?
You know?
I don't know.
For now, why don't we just keep it, you know...
I'm gonna take a walk.
Catch a bus.
Talk to you later. Okay?
Hello?
Hello?
Whoa! The whole family!
I hate Barcelona!
Come on!
I've got to go to work now, darling.
See you. Love you.
Ladies and gentlemen, and now the lovely Ulla!
Ooh, ooh
Which party shall I go to
Tonight
Now tell me, whose mug shall I smile at tonight
I'm gonna look for it
I'm gonna lie for it
I'm gonna swing for it
I'm gonna shout
Better than words?
So you like Ulla, do you?
- Just get here?
- Yeah.
Yeah? I was just gonna call you.
We're on our way to another place.
- All?
- Yeah, my friends.
I thought we'd be alone.
Oh, come on. Be with us.
I'd rather be with you.
Yeah?
- Okay. Come on.
- Really?
First read.
Then sign, please.
So...
It's all right. It's a formality.
Of course. Huh!
Read first, please.
I know someone who could get two tickets to Fidelio.
So, is that what they mean by university education?
Maybe.
All right if I go out and pick up some cigarettes?
Yes, you can do anything you like.
There's an all-night bar around the corner, near the bridge. Ask for the ale.
- Superior to the beer.
- Thanks.
Dr. Linden.
Will you be coming back here or going home... after the cigarettes?
I thought I was free to do whatever I like.
Absolutely.
It's just to know where, later on, to give you any news, if necessary.
I'll be back.
Sure.
But I thought you said he was in the army, your father.
It's a rather strange envelope, no?
It's normal for him.
He works for a wire service in San Francisco.
Left the army three years ago.
Mother loved it there.
I miss her terribly.
She was only 46 when she died.
Can I have a cigarette?
Married again last year.
She's nice. Teaches.
I drifted back... drifted back here where Daddy was stationed when I was little.
Actually, Paris first.
That's where we were all together last.
I worked at this and that.
I worked for one guy, had 20,000 bees, and he didn't even like honey.
He wasn't very funny either.
So my brother died in an auto accident.
Daddy could hardly get himself together.
Guess with he and Mother gone we weren't much of a family anymore.
Just... people on our own.
Ever been married?
Nope.
I hate these sheets.
I hope that I won't be that wrong
Anymore
And maybe I've learned this time
I hope that I find
What I'm reaching for
The way that it is in my mind
Someday
I'll get over you
I'll live
To see it all through
But I'll always miss
Dreaming my dreams with you
No, I won't let it chain me
Not if I can
I'd rather believe
In love
And give it away
Just as much as I can
To those that I'm fondest of
Someday
I'll get over you
I'll live
To see it all through
But I'll always miss
Dreaming my dreams with you
Hi.
Danke schön.
- How you doin'?
- What happened?
- You don't like it. Do you?
- Don't like what?
- My outfit. The way I look.
- You look fine.
- Oh, come on. I look better than that, don't I?
- Right. You look real fine.
Bought it for you. Aren't you happy?
- Couldn't be happier. You're a day late.
- Hey, I wired you, didn't I?
Yeah. It was waiting for me when I got back.
Alex, I'm moving in with you.
Can't we just... just do one thing for me. Never force yourself to be different from who you are.
Well, how am I then? Huh?
You tell me. How am I?
You're just fine if you forget someone was waiting.
Look, can't we just forget all that?
What, forget that 'cause you got on something pretty, it changes who you are?
I was gonna tell you something.
I was...
I'm sorry.
Milena, I'm sorry.
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere!
Hiya, Doc. Colonel Taylor here.
I hear you're thinking of going to New York.
Confirm one way or another, because we've got some important profile work coming up.
Oh, by the way, the NATO people were delighted with what you did... on those two files yester...
Hi, sweet. It's Amy here.
I just got back from L.A., so give me a call when you've got ti...
- You got a whole department here.
- You oughta see what we got in Italy.
You said this is a rush job, right?
Yeah. Otherwise I'd have used one of our regulars.
But, as you can see, we're working full blast.
Got some people coming in soon...
Files, Inga.
Need some up-to-date psychological reports.
You know, the usual.
- She's Viennese? I thought...
- Born in America of Austrian parents.
Regular army through and through.
One of us.
You'll find everything you need to know about these two guys in here.
- Or maybe you won't.
- Any idea what it's for?
Come on.
For all I know, it could be because their names both begin with the same initials.
You just work out whether either one of them is likely to sniff coke or play with little girls... or boys.
I don't know what any of it's for.
Maybe they forward it to
American Express for credit ratings.
I'm just cleared for taking them out of the cabinet and putting them back in the cabinet.
- All yours, Doctor.
- Doctor.
Inga.
No, no, it wasn't anything so shadowy or complicated.
Why would she marry him?
Listen, I've had men in my life... and only one would I have liked to marry.
But there are problems. You know?
But marry him?
Sure. Why not?
Did he want to marry her?
Why not?
As for him and intelligence work, it's ridiculous.
I think he would be flattered someone he didn't know was analyzing him.
Though I'm sure he'd be as amazed as he would amused.
Of course, everything I say has to be taken in the context of who I am.
I'm only joking.
Suddenly so sad, so silent?
- Mmm.
- So sad, so silent.
- That's me.
- Here. Have some.
You know I hate this stuff.
Why didn't you tell me you were married?
I... didn't...
You sort of lied, though.
A relative is what you said was over the border.
If I told you I was married... you'd think it meant your way, and it wasn't like that.
So better I...
I don't think it was a lie.
It was words.
It's not important.
- Not important?
- Nope.
To whom?
Not important to whom?
To whom? To whom?
To whom? To whom?
Not important to whom?
To whom?
It's over. Took time to get out.
And for how long out?
A week? A month?
A day?
For good.
You still love him?
I married him. Of course I loved him.
I don't anymore.
He's what I needed then.
He's almost 30 years older than you.
You think you're not?
- Are you cold? Mm-hmm?
- Yeah, I am cold.
Why is everybody so nosy over nothing? Hmm?
I know something much better.
I'm not everybody.
No, you're not.
Anybody home?
Yoo-hoo! Alex!
- Hi!
- Hi, darling.
- How you doin'?
- I'm great.
Good. Mmm!
Where are we going tonight?
- I'll tell you about it.
- Better be exciting. I'm in an exciting mood.
- You're in the mood, huh?
- Yeah.
- All right. Let's go.
- Where?
Tonight I thought I would take you to the library.
The what?
You've got lipstick all over you.
Well, it's just that...
Stefan lived through the... going here and there... doing crazy things on a whim.
Oh, he'd do them for me.
I tried to please him.
Stopped doing whatever it was
I felt at the moment.
Oh, I don't know.
Seems the more rules I make for myself, the unhappier I get.
You like me, huh?
- I like you.
- How much?
This much.
Is that all?
All right.
Find me charming too?
I am immune to your charms.
- Who said that?
- Guess.
Oh, a certain shrink I know.
- Wrong.
- Who?
You don't know, huh?
How do you keep a moron in suspense?
- How?
- I'll tell you later.
I love you, honey, but I don't know why.
I am going to fix us a terrific cheese omelet.
That is, if I can.
Even a not-so-terrific one would be great.
You got it.
What did you think of the play tonight?
Well, coach?
The drama?
Dr. Linden!
- Dr. Linden?
- No, we don't need Dr. Linden now.
Rest. Rest.
Smoke.
Soon we'll have a chance to speak.
- What?
- With me.
Who is the doctor who took over when the woman was brought in?
Dr. Schneider.
See if I can have a word with her on the telephone.
Well, Doctor... is there hope for us?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Passaplatz.
Yes, I need some information on...
Yes? On what?
Divorce in your country.
I have...
Stairway to the second floor, first door on the right.
Danke schön.
Please.
Essentially, what I'm asking is... how does one go about getting a divorce in your country?
In my country, as anywhere else... the first step is to ask for one.
But how does such a question come to be asked by you?
Someone I know... a friend, an American... is married to a Czech.
It would seem, then, that the problem, if there is one... is not properly one of your concern.
I asked you not to go.
You could cause trouble for Stefan.
Milena, either you're married or divorced.
You can't be in-between.
To be in-between is to be no place at all.
I don't get it.
I can't find anything around here anymore.
I put something down,
I go to look for it, it's gone.
Could spend more time at your place.
My place is getting to look exactly like your place.
This must be his car.
It's open.
About 14 minutes.
Let's say a comfortable quarter of an hour.
Yes, but if there was traffic...
Traffic.
1:00 in the morning? Nonsense.
Well, well, the radio is on.
That's the... late station.
So that's what you do at night... you listen to music instead of your communications band.
- Never.
- What time does it start?
- Never!
- The late station, Gudagast. The late station.
Around midnight, I think.
Oh, he thinks.
It was open.
Right again.
Like?
Incredible.
I was just thinking, if I'm not nice to you, if I'm mean, it'd be easy for you to leave me.
Look. Look at the kitchen.
Oh! Look.
Your favorite sheets.
- That's great.
- Yeah.
Alex. Not now.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
- What is it?
- Nothing. It's just that I don't want to.
What do you wanna do then?
What's so urgent?
We can just sit and talk, be with each other.
Relax. You're so tense these days.
Hey, we're okay.
I'll talk. It's just that you don't want to face the things I want to talk about.
- I daren't talk.
- Oh, honey.
Please. Come sit down.
Okay, what do you wanna talk about?
Haven't we anything else left? I just wanted us to be nice together, that's all.
You say you wanna be nice.
- I'd like you to be this and...
- Is that the only way I can be nice to you?
You know that's not true.
Do I?
Anyway, I have to go soon.
Why do you have to go?
I have things... some stuff I was gonna do.
What if we'd made love?
But we didn't.
Anyway, I really can't stay.
I'm sorry if I spoiled things.
Alex, don't go. Wait.
- Why are you lying to yourself all the time?
- I'm not. I have to go.
Wait. Wait a minute, Alex.
Look...
You gotta understand me, the way I am.
I mean... there's nobody else... they're all in your head.
But I must be who I am.
You know, to be with people you don't like... and, I don't know, get up when I want to get up... and eat when I want to eat... drink when I want to drink and fuck when I want to fuck!
I'm sure you will.
You do everything only when you want to.
See ya tomorrow, same time, same place.
Fuck you.
Wait a minute. Wait! Alex!
Wait! Alex!
Alex.
Alex.
You want me?
Come on. Come on.
Do it now, Alex. Do it now.
Here it is, Alex.
Here it is. Look at it, Alex!
Alex! Don't you want it?
There it is, Alex! Come here! Come here!
Come here and take it.
That's what you want. Here it is!
Come on!
Don't you want it?
Then do it now! Fuck me!
Fuck me right here and now, goddamn it!
- I'll fuck you.
- Huh?
There you go.
Stick in it there then?
That's it.
Oh, God.
- Oh, God.
- That's all it is? That's all it is?
Oh, God.
Love me.
Love me!
Love me!
Love me! Damn it!
Oh, fuck.
Oh, fuck!
Good night.
Right again.
What a mess. Just like my sister's.
Nothing!
Nothing.
Come back!
Bonjour, monsieur.
Notre voiture est en panne.
Nous allons à Ouarzazate.
Pouvez-vous nous aider, s'il vous plait?
- Ouarzazate?
- Oui.
- Ouarzazate c'est lá-bas.
- Oui.
- Nous allons ici.
- Je vous en prie, monsieur.
- Qui est-il?
- Il est mon frère seulement.
- Bon. Vous...
- Merci.
Vous montez derrière.
Il y a une seule place ici pour votre soeur.
C'est très, très beau.
What's happening?
- à deux semaines.
- Ai, yi, yi, yi, yi.
American. Beautiful!
- Merci.
- Shake the guy.
- Come on. D'accord?
- Oui.
Oui.
Shake the guy.
Monsieur. Monsieur. Enough. Enough.
Oui. Oui.
I remember in New York... across from us, on the other side of the park... there was this beautiful, old mansion.
It was very elegant, aristocratic.
It made me feel good knowing something so beautiful... was so close.
Around it were lots of other lovely buildings, mostly built, I think... around the turn of the century.
One by one, they went down... and one by one, up went mostly monstrosities.
But that one building remained.
It was there.
Someone said an eccentric millionaire owned it.
At night, as a kid, when I'd walk across the park...
I'd use it to guide me.
Then later, when I graduated, started to teach... it was still there.
One day I had to go to Boston.
That was Friday.
When I got back on Tuesday, it was gone.
Gone, like that.
What?
Nothing.
I found this on the floor.
Hi! I missed you!
- I've been shopping.
- New York?
I have an option to renew my contract with the university, which I won't.
But I say we go back, we get married, we build something solid to...
What about now?
- What do you mean "now"?
- Here, right now. This minute, this second.
Look where we are.
Milena, did you miss that I asked you just now to marry me?
No.
Well, what are you talking about?
I'm asking you to marry me.
- What are you...
- I've loved these days.
- I've loved them.
- I don't get it.
- Well, weren't you happy?
- Yes!
- You had to be happy. I felt it.
- I am happy. I was happy.
- It can be that way from now on.
- I am happy.
When I'm with you, I'm with you.
I love being with you.
Milena, what does that mean?
"With me," "not with me."
- You have a husband you don't want, but you...
- I just... My own life.
My own time.
You can be a part of it, the biggest part of it.
You are the biggest part of it.
I love you.
Come on.
Okay? Look at where we are.
Look at this.
- Yes?
- Dr. Alex Linden?
- Yes.
- Your call to Bratislava is ready.
- Do you still want it?
- Yes, I want it.
Fine. We'll put you through as requested.
- Hold the line.
- Yes.
Yes.
- Uh, my name is, uh...
- Yes?
Yes, Alex Linden. You've heard of me?
To be sure.
Look, this is as embarrassing for me as it must be for you.
Listen, Mr. Linden.
Please come to the point... and tell me what I owe this communication to.
Milena. She hasn't been seen for almost a week.
I haven't seen her, and I'm worried, and I thought you...
I thought maybe you knew where she was.
You there? Did you hear me?
Yes, I heard you, Mr. Linden, and, no, I don't know.
Please help me.
Someplace, someone she might... that you know.
Believe me, Dr. Linden.
I would most certainly tell you if I knew... because what I want more than anything is for Milena to get bored with you... as soon as possible... and it may come as a surprise to you, more for her sake than for mine.
So why don't you just bugger off!
This Stefan Vognic...
He's her husband, is he not?
- I think so.
- Then there's a question in your mind?
He's her husband.
Do you know him?
We spoke on the phone.
Does Mr. Vognic...
He is aware of the relationship that exists between you and his wife, is he not?
- What relationship is that?
- You tell me.
I told him. I told you already.
I'm a friend.
Yes. Forgive me. Of course.
A friend.
And this is why she telephoned you when...
But as I understand, you didn't believe her... because this wasn't the first time she telephoned you, threatening to kill herself.
Is that a correct assessment of the truth?
It is, but I went all the same.
Without, however, taking the business very seriously. Right?
Say good-bye.
Right.
I see.
You went to make sure... but you were convinced you would find
Mrs. Vognic alive and well, as usual.
Am I right?
You like Superman?
- Superman?
- It's Superman. Why you say "Superman"?
It's not a bad book.
Would you excuse me?
- You going to Hummels's party?
- Ciao.
Bye-bye.
Lost your tan.
- You've lost your tan.
- More than a month. It fades.
Doesn't matter.
You look good, tan or no tan.
Heard you've been trying to find me.
- Why didn't you call me?
- I did, five, 10 times.
I didn't know, did I?
I guess it was...
I guess it was as difficult for you as it was for me.
But maybe if you would have... left a message or something.
Maybe...
Alex, some interesting papers arrived from America.
- Let's have a coffee and talk?
- Sure.
Who's the guy?
Does it matter?
Why did you come here?
I don't know, Alex. I...
Guess I was... Maybe I wanted to stumble into you. I...
Sounds reasonable, but how can I believe you?
What are you afraid of, Alex?
Let's not argue.
You're calling me a liar.
He's not the guy in the photo, is he?
What photo?
You and someone at a lake.
You took them?
Stefan I know, but that someone at the lake...
It wasn't him... or him.
Would it really matter if I told you?
Who?
The lake was in California.
And the boy was my fucking brother.
You don't believe me, do you?
You think I'm lying.
Think? You'll never change, Milena.
Never.
If you weren't who you are,
I wouldn't have to.
Oh, God, I'm...
I'm glad you decided to get rid of me, Alex. You know that?
Because I did love you, and...
I couldn't...
Oh, geez, I...
- Fuck off.
- You're drunk.
- Disappear.
- Milena, I want to explain.
Tell it to your students.
It's just that I can't stand to think of you with anyone else.
Please. I'm tired. I had too much.
I need sleep. Please, just go.
Milena, I love you.
Please. I waited all night out there in the car.
It's fucking daylight.
You want me to tell you
I slept with someone?
Is that what you want? We fucked?
Would you believe that?
Is that what you want to believe?
What do you want to know?
The truth?
No, you'd only call it a lie.
What do you want to do, go up and make love?
Go up and fuck?
You want us to do that?
You want me to do that?
What is it you want?
Okay. I love you.
I don't love you.
What do you want me to say?
What do you want me to do because of that?
Kill myself?
Would you be sure then?
Would you? Would you?
What do I want? What do you want?
I want you to be mine.
No, you don't.
You want to own me and dump me.
Well, I don't want to be yours or anyone's.
Greedy bastard.
You got everything. You had everything.
Know everything.
I don't want any fucking thing of mine... let alone yours.
I'm not ambitious.
I'm not a fucking artist... or a poet... or a philosopher... or a goddamn revolutionary.
I don't want to have to pretend I am for anybody.
I just want to be allowed... to give where I can... how I can... to whom I can.
For Christ's sake, don't ever use that word "love" again... and I promise I won't.
You want me to give you a great big present, Alex?
Yes, I did do it! I did it!
But you made me do it.
You're driving me crazy!
Why did I ever meet you anyway? What?
Did you know that Mrs. Vognic took drugs?
No.
Tests made before the operation reveal considerable traces... of amphetamine in her blood.
Amphetamine.
She may have taken stimulants. She suffered at times from severe depressions.
Drugs aren't so unusual, are they?
You wouldn't recommend them, would you, Doctor?
I'm not her doctor.
I'm a friend. That's it.
Of course.
Did you get her the prescription?
- I'm a friend. That's it.
- Of course. You did tell us that. Yes.
Another? You may smoke if you like.
This, Dr. Linden... is an extract from our archives.
The Germans have always been very good at archives.
This is Austria.
"On the fifth of May...
"a disturbance was reported by various neighbors...
"living in the
Schonbrunner Schlossstrasse.
"Complaints were filed against Milena Vognic...
"for drunken and disorderly conduct.
"After additional inquiries it was learned that the party receiving the attack...
"of verbal abuse was...
"Dr. Alex Linden... currently on the faculty."
So what does that mean?
Of course... but what caused that?
That?
I told you, she's a very erratic person.
We decided not to see each other after that... for a while, at least.
Why did you decide not to see each other?
How, Dr. Linden, would you account for a young girl... getting into a state... drugs, depressions?
Oh, you love... Oh!
- Yes
- Alex?
Yeah.
Alex, I think I've done something stupid.
- What are you up to?
- Nothing.
Is someone there?
- No. Nobody's here.
- There isn't, is there?
No, and, Milena, I really want to talk to you. I've been thinking about things.
Oh, yeah?
Really, we ought to talk.
No one there, huh?
Listen, it's a little late for drunken phone calls.
Oh, Christ, the usual lecture.
Jesus, Alex!
Why don't you just fuck me to death?
I've done it, Alex.
I feel so strange and fucked up and confused in my head.
"No one there." You are a creep.
- It's none of your business.
- You creep! You liar!
Why don't you just fuck off!
Milena, your scenes are boring, dull and stupid.
Stupid?
Not according to that orange file of yours.
Not according to that, huh?
You know, you really are a prick.
Don't worry. I won't embarrass you anymore.
You'll be able to close that file, Alex Linden.
Milena, I wanted to talk to you about all this.
I hate to be hung up on.
She wouldn't do anything stupid.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Milena?
Milena?
Welcome to the wake!
Chains, so you can lock me up, and I'll forever be yours.
Did you bring your orange file for protection?
Oh, don't worry about it.
It doesn't matter.
- You've won.
- I've won?
We are celebrating the death of the Milena you don't want... and the birth of the Milena you do want.
Don't I look pretty?
Don't you like... Mmm-mmm! Ehh!
Here! For you. The only one, sir.
The only one chains for which you have the only key!
For you. For Milena's freedom.
Leave, and you've killed me!
Leave, and I'm dead!
Don't go. Help me!
I need you now! I need you, please!
Me? You need me now?
Milena, you have so many friends.
Call 'em. Call 'em now.
- I'll throw myself out the window!
- Be my guest.
Alex! Alex, no, don't go!
Alex, please, don't!
Alex!
Alex! Alex!
Where are you? Come here, you...
Alex! Alex!
Alex! Alex!
Come on there, you! You hear me?
There you are! Get you!
You'd like me to do it, wouldn't you?
Admit it! Admit it!
You'd like to see me dead! Oh!
- Shit! Shit! Shit!
- Milena.
- Milena!
- Why ruin your neat little existence, Alex?
- Why?
- Stop that, you crazy bitch!
That's what you wanted!
Neaten up your little fucking life!
Get clear of it! Fucker! I hate you!
I'll jump! I'll do it!
- I'll do it!
- Stop that!
Oh, blow it out your ass! Fuck you!
Fuck you! I hate your fucking guts!
Don't go away. Watch! I'm going to do it,
Alex! I'm going to do it for you! Alex!
Don't go. Watch me!
That's what you want, isn't it?
I'll jump. I'll jump.
I'll jump. I'll jump.
God!
Who are you
Who, who, who, who
Who are you
Who, who, who, who
Who are you
Who, who, who, who
Who are you
Who, who, who, who
I woke up in a Soho doorway
A policeman knew my name
He said, you can go sleep at home tonight
If you can get up and walk away
I staggered back to the underground
And the breeze blew back my hair
I remember throwin' punches around
And preachin' from my chair
- Well, who are you
- Who are you
Who, who, who, who
"The said, et cetera, et cetera, telephoned me at about 1:30."
I can't remember the time with any precision.
But I'm not asking you for the precise time.
So could it have been half past 12:00 perhaps?
- 10:00? 11:00? Midnight?
- No.
You see, it wasn't 11:00, it wasn't midnight.
- Could it have been 1:00?
- Wrong again.
If you know I'm wrong, then you must know what the correct answer is.
- It wasn't 1:00.
- Later or earlier?
Which? Later? Earlier?
Later, naturally.
"Naturally"?
- Not 2:00?
- Obviously.
"Obviously."
Yes?
I...
I wanted to say good-bye.
You said it exceptionally well the other night, Milena.
Alex, please...
Alex?
I didn't mean to. I...
Oh, Alex, please don't go.
Alex?
Please?
Oh, God.
I wanted...
I wanted us to have a real good-bye.
I wanted...
I wanted us to have a real good-bye.
Oh, God, I'm tired.
Very tired.
Tired or drunk?
That's right. Pissed.
How else could I get myself ready?
God... Good-bye to you.
No, Alex.
I've done something stupid.
Really stupid.
What did you do after you got the call?
- Did you have to dress?
- No. I was working.
I put on my jacket and tie.
Your tie?
Then you went to your car?
Like this, or faster? Or slower?
More or less like now.
- Was the radio playing?
- What does that mean?
While you were on your way to see... whether Mrs. Vognic had...
Stop calling her "Mrs. Vognic."
While on your way to see whether there had or had not been a suicide... you switched the car radio on.
It was still on an hour ago when I went for the first time... to look at her apartment.
You wouldn't, by chance, remember what was playing?
I don't know. Music.
A news bulletin maybe.
Do you have a light?
Maybe it was the late station.
No, it wasn't the late station.
The radio was tuned to the second station.
I switched it off myself.
Thanks.
- Herr Hauptmann.
- Hauptmann Netusil.
- Go up. I'll join you in a minute. Stay here.
- Hauptmann Netusil.
Hauptmann Netusil.
- Hauptmann Netusil.
- Yes. Speaking. What?
Alex?
You came.
Well, we've decided it took me about 20 minutes to drive here.
Where was she when you entered?
Mrs. Vognic rang you between 1:00 and 1:30... which means she was in a condition to dial and talk.
So?
She arrived at the hospital about one hour later in a state of advanced coma.
- So?
- So?
An abnormally rapid toxic process, wouldn't you say?
- Hmm?
- Not my branch. Ask a specialist.
I have.
When Mrs. Vognic reached the hospital, she had swallowed the pills... at least three or four hours before.
If she swallowed the poison, let's say, between 10:30 and 11:30... then at 1:30 she was in no condition to ring anybody... or even move a finger.
You follow me?
Maybe she phoned earlier. I don't know.
Maybe I didn't leave that quickly.
I wasn't convinced.
I probably was...
It must have been half an hour before I got here.
I mean, she'd threatened before.
And there's that business about your radio being tuned to the second station.
You know, don't you, that the second station ends at midnight?
Now, please, Dr. Linden... be kind enough to tell me... exactly what did occur when you received her call.
You're not gonna scare me, Milena... not with a weak gesture like this.
Why don't you scare Konrad, that slob you kissed at that café?
He'd laugh at you now, throw a bomb at somebody.
Or Giavanni, although he's probably at the theater tonight.
If only you could've gotten yourself together.
We could have...
It could have been good.
But you couldn't get it together.
My sweet, you've been drunk before.
You've handled it then, you will now on your own... without help.
Who would you call anyway?
That young guy in the photo?
Your brother?
Your brother.
I'm here.
We don't need anybody else.
Just you and me.
Help me.
Louder.
Help.
It's better this way.
Believe me... there was no other way.
If you arrived here, let's say, two or three hours... before you said you did...
Which I didn't.
Of course. Only detection.
What is it if not a process of elimination?
Why I chose this profession... a puzzle.
Certainly the law doesn't interest me.
But...
When I see...
When I see...
And, well...
I see you.
- Where was I?
- You were making incorrect assumptions.
Yes, yes. Anyway, if... if... then you would have to explain why you allowed all that time to elapse... before calling for an ambulance.
But what about all those Marlboro butts?
You smoked quite a few last night waiting for the ambulance.
They could have been there for weeks.
One could never accuse Mrs. Vognic of an obsession with cleanliness.
- Ask the portress.
- I have.
What I need is a confession.
Would you like to confess, Dr. Linden?
To what?
The truth of the matter,
Dr. Linden, is... that no one cares about Article 139B.
Suicide.
It has little, if any, indictable application to this case.
But Article 205... ravishment.
There we have quite another apple, do we not?
You know,
I ordered a vaginal swab taken... as detection demands.
Wake up, Milena.
Don't sleep.
Wake up.
Tell me!
We're alone here. No witnesses.
Tell you.
A sort of confirmation.
Tell you what?
About ravishment.
I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
Difficult, the law.
Difficult.
In this area... it's not as clear as it could be.
Ravishment.
It has to do with... when... well, in... in a sense... in a sense, you take advantage of someone's love.
You disguise your feelings of... of hatred.
Somehow I have the feeling we're talking about you and not me.
We are not unalike.
I could understand.
People who live in this sort of disorder... this sort of moral and physical sewer... they spread it around them like an infectious disease.
Dangerous creatures... to themselves and others.
They envy our strength... our capacity to fight... our will to master reality.
What do they do?
They try to drag us into their confusion... their chaos.
Anything to get you.
Anything to get you back... back the way it was.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you. I love you, Milena.
I love you, Milena.
I love you.
I love you.
Hello. We need an ambulance.
It's urgent.
What?
Schonbrunner Schlossstrasse.
Confess. Please, Dr. Linden.
As a personal favor.
Personal favor.
You see, a swab would prove nothing.
I fear I am not so good a detective.
But... But what is detection if not confession?
Confess between us. It might help.
Help who?
You.
I can help you, Dr. Linden.
Confess, between us.
Tell me what you... dare not.
I had a phone call before... in the car.
- Is she dead?
- Hmm.
No.
She will live.
Then you don't need me anymore.
Everything you need you can get from her.
Excellent. Thankful news.
But for me, perhaps, it arrived a moment too early.
I trust... both you gentlemen will... make yourselves available to me for the next few days.
What did you get from her, Dr. Linden?
Not enough, I think.
You must understand, you see, it's not enough to love a woman... when she is so difficult.
You must love her tremendously.
More even than one's own dignity.
Don't you agree?
I've got to take two with me this afternoon.
Ann, those are the strangest...
They're not mine.
Milena.
- Milena!
- Call me.
The same old story
It's as old as the stars above
The same old story
Of a boy and a girl in love
The scenes say more moonlight
The times say more June light
Romance's the thing
Two hearts away
Deep in a dream
The same old story
It's been told much too much before
The same old story
But it's worth telling just once more
It's all fun and laughter
They lived ever after
In ecstasy
The same old story
But it's new to me

Maybe Charlie could bring a friend or two.
No.
And you better be careful.
Sometimes when a person acts wild and crazy, wild and crazy things happen to them.
They do?
Yeah, believe me.
Anything could happen in this creepy place, but I have a feeling it's the last time I baby-sit.
Listen, I gotta go.

Not here.
Not now.

Upstairs, 10 seconds.

Charlie, you clean?
What kind of a question is that?
Of course I 'm clean.
Besides, you can't wash away herpes.

Julie.
Julie, you're not responding to my maleness.
Julie, are you asleep?
[heavy breathing]
Holy shit!
No!
Woman:
What a waste of money.
$10 for a movie,
$5.00 for popcorn.
Man: Don't forget
$15 for parking and a baby-sitter.
If I see one more horror film, I 'll throw up.
What makes them think the American public wants to watch such stupid trash?
You're right, dear.
Now hurry up or we'll miss
 The Dukes of Hazzard.
She left the door open.
Julie, we're home.
Where is that girl?
I hope she wasn't murdered in our bed.
Woman: Aaah!
Aaaah!
Aaaah!
What's wrong?
Look at the sink!
Your finger?
You hurt your finger?
She didn't wash the dishes!
75 cents an hour.
She didn't wash one dish.
Where is that girl?
Maybe she's watching TV.
At 75 cents an hour?
We'll see about that.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Chicken.
Hmm.
Broken.
[heavy breathing]
Aaaah!
She left the TV on!
Oh, where is that girl?
I'll find her.
I'll find her.
The TV is left on, the dishes undone, and look at this mess.
She's ruined the stairs.
What's going on in my home at 75 cents an hour?
Calm down, calm down.
You know how high-strung you are.
The doctor said one more heart attack and it's all over for you.
Are you murmuring?
Fluttering?
Do you want your pills?
Don't worry about the stairs.
I'll clean them.
You know how I like cleaning gum off of things.
The important thing is that you calm down and relax.
Well, I 'll be darned.
Aah!
Today is a sad day for me, perhaps the saddest in my tenure as principal of our school, dear old Lamab High.
For me, to look down on the corpses of 2 former students is very painful, and I 'll bet it's no picnic for the parents either, but we must go on, for although today is a sad day, it is also a big day-- the day of the big parade.
The big game...
I told her to be careful.
Shh.
I told her not to have
Charlie come over.
Why wouldn't she listen?
The big queen crowning, the big yearbook signing party, the big panty raid, the big tree trimming.
Stop. How can you think of sex now?
I can never stop thinking about it.
Funerals get me hot.
Now this, the big funeral.
Now, we could moan about the fact that we have to have the extracurricular activities in one day due to state budget cuts, but that wouldn't be in the spirit of Lamab High, would it?
Let's hear it for life.
Ok, give me a boo!
Give me a hoo!
Give me a boo hoo hoo!
Beat death!
Yay!
Thank you, members of the pep team.
Sex kills.
Sex kills.
Back, Malvert, back!
Do you want people to be suspicious of you?
Look at those two sneaking off.
Boy: Maybe they have to go to the bathroom or something.
We can't do it now.
My mother found my diaphragm.
What?
I'll get some protection.
I'll get foam and rubbers.
Don't start without me.
[heavy breathing]
Breather: Yoo-hoo.
Anybody home?
Joe, what's that?
I'm gonna give you horse head.
You're not Joe!
Aah!
Joe: Oh, you started without me.
Bertha?
[heavy breathing]
Bertha?
Oh! [gasps]
Oh, Mrs. Smith,
I'm Mrs. Hummers.
Julie was baby-sitting at my house when she got it.
Now I wanted you to have the money I owed her.
It's all there.
5 hours at 65 cents an hour.
Oh, and I also included
Julie 's car fare-- one way, of course.
So, I mean, it's not your fault, you know?
I've been trying to tell you that all this time.
Don't worry.
Oh, look. There's Joe.
Joe!
This is not very funny!
Joe, this is not my idea of a joke, and--and you're acting in very bad taste!
Aah!
Oh, Hardy, have you been fooling around with my bicycle seat again?
No.
What did you hit now?
Damn dog again.
Where are you?!
Where are you?!
What do you think you're doin'?
Hey, man, that's my parking space.
Can't you see I 'm blind?
Hey, I 'm more handicapped than you.
I can't even make love to a woman!
I can never find one!
Now move it.
Hey, that's our parking spot.
Great physical beauty can be a handicap, too.
Who could have done these murders?
I don't know.
It could have been anybody.
Well, it can't be anybody.
It's gotta be somebody.
Well, of course, it's somebody.
But that somebody could be anybody.
Well, look, we didn't do it, right?
Right.
So you can't say it could be anybody.
We're anybody.
True. But we're also somebody.
Whoever the killer is couldn't have chosen a worse day.
In any case, we must remember the 3 Ps :
No police, no publicity, and, uh...
No pasta.
Don't let the pressure get to you, Harlow.
That's the third &quot;p.&quot;
I can't stand the pressure.
You're a brilliant educator.
You need some rest.
[bell rings]
Class, today we will learn how to make... a horse head bookend.
[class groans]
Perhaps man's highest cultural achievement is the horse head bookend.
With rape... and violence... rampant in this land.
With human flesh cheap and... and vulgarized, one of the last bastions of decency is the gentle satisfaction one gains from making a horse head bookend.
Just a minute, son.
Me, sir?
Yeah, yeah, the one in the bed sheets.
Take that tambourine off your head.
You belong to this school?
Yes, sir.
My name is Mawamba.
Is that a fact?
Do you know the school year began in September?
This is the last day in June.
I'm a bussing student, sir, from the zowie.
The zowie?
That near Philadelphia?
It's in Africa, sir.
That's why I 'm late.
My bus just got in.
Do you know anything about... horse head bookends?
No, sir.
Good.
Now we only have one day to work with you
'cause it's the last day of school.
Now you're gonna make horse heads, jungle boy.
You're gonna have horse heads coming out of your ears.
Now one more question.
Would you mind telling me... how come you're not in your neighborhood school?
It's a court order.
A court order, huh?
A court order?
Now that the right people have taken over this country, you're gonna see some real court orders.
Now sit down and make horse heads.
Now, remember, class...
You won't believe what I saw over there.
What?
Don't ask.
Look--look at this.
Where did you get that?
I found it where Joe and bertha were murdered.
They shouldn't have been doing that at a funeral.
Talking?
During horse head bookends?
Who was that?
Sure, the girl.
What have we here, Miss...
&quot;Shouldn't be in the class anyway&quot;?
Well, it's a horse head bookend, Mr. Duncan.
You stained it and everything.
Yes, sir.
I couldn't have done a better job myself.
That's what I was thinking.
Don't mind us, girls.
We prom queen candidates have to get changed for the parade.
Hey, how come I have to break my ass playing volleyball while you get all dolled up?
'cause I 'm beautiful and you're hideous.
Oh, yeah? Someday, you'll be old and ugly.
Oh, no, I won't.
Take a look at this.
I have these saved up for the very first sign of wrinkles.
What is it, vitamin E?
Cyanide capsules.
Death before disfigurement.
You're sick.
Girl: Has anybody seen Toby?
She's in big trouble.
She was found with a weapon, and...
Breather:
Ha. I love locker rooms.
I love girls' locker rooms.
I love sweat.
I love girls' sweat.
[heavy breathing] what's the matter with you guys?
I don't know what's the matter with them, but I 'm nervous about becoming prom queen.
Breather: queens.
Hey, you haven't won yet.
Well, listen, darling, with a figure like this...
Breather:
Nice figure.
...that's French.
French. French.
I like French.
[heavy breathing]
Skin.
[breathing faster]
Boobs! Boobs!
Very fun.
Itchy. Icky.
I'm taking it out of my pants.
I'm doin' what my mommy told me not to do.
[heavy panting]
Oh! Ah!
Oh! Oh! Aah! Aah!
Aah! Aah! Aah!
Aahooh!
Girl: All right, let's move it! Let's go!
[all chattering]
[heavy breathing]
[breathing faster]
[inhales, slow, deep breathing]
[breathing stops]
[breathing]
[breathing stops]
[breathing quietly]
[heavy breathing]
[gasping]
Why do they always run away from me?
It's the galoshes.
They're a dead giveaway.
Why do I wear 'em?
It isn't even raining.
[heavy breathing]
My luck.
I picked a jogger.
[heavy breathing]
[heavy breathing]
Unh! I can't get a break!
[grunts]
[heavy breathing]
Aah! Oh!
Mr. Malvert!
You Mrs. Malvert.
No!
Say no to Malvert?
Yes! No!
Help Malvert.
Malvert have big problem.
5-letter word for stealth-like.
Creep!
Malvert thanks!
[band playing when
 The Saints Go Marching In]
Lovely day for a parade.
Or a murder.
Yes.
Principal:
Ladies and gentlemen, the Lamab High
Marching Band.
The finest marching band on this street at this moment.
And remember, my dear friends, this may not be the biggest parade in the world, but it will be the most sincere.
We have dedicated it to those students who have...passed on.
For, like everyone else, even the dead love a parade.
I'd like to make a special appeal to the killer.
Hasn't there been enough senseless killing?
Let's have a murder that makes sense.
The cheerleaders are taking off their blouses.
Yeah, yeah!
And the prom queen candidates, no clothes on.
Oh, man, yeah!
So you got my dollar?
And on the next float, our lovely prom queen candidates, uh, or what's left of them.
[heavy breathing in tune with song]
Meet Patti Priswell,
Joan d'amico, and Barry, our boy queen candidate.
Man, that Dagmar sure looks good.
Are you crazy?
Later, man.
Our school mascot the bull.
When I say that
Kanab has the finest educational standards in the state, what do you say? Bull!
Look, over there.
[roars]
Did you see that?
Hardy: Well, maybe he's helping her find a bathroom or something.
Let's get comfortable, baby.
The floor may be hard, but I 'm soft.
Couldn't you pick a better place?
I can't help it.
Hollow bulls get me hot.
[heavy breathing]
Here I am.
You always want to do it in the daytime.
Can't we do it at night?
Yeah, but--
Breather: Let me see.
A murder weapon.
What's in this goddamn float?
Ok, ok, it's gonna be slow.
Hey, man!
Hey, slow down!
[Breather becomes more excited]
Breather:
I gotta find something.
There must be something.
Ah! All right!
No!
You like eggplant?
Not eggplant! Aah!
[roars]
Ok, baby.
Breather:
♪ Welcome back! ♪
Ooh, I like your outfit.
What's this? I thought you hated eggplant.
Ralph?
Dagmar? Aah!
[heavy breathing]
No!
Toby: Where are you?
You guys, I saw you come down here.
Dagmar? Aah!
[roars]
It's a big day!
Big day, big day,
Miss Mumsley.
Oh, my god.
Student bodies!
Student bodies!
Ladies and gentlemen, in order to achieve an &quot;R&quot; rating today, a motion picture must contain full frontal nudity, graphic violence, or an explicit reference to the sex act.
Since this film has none of those and since research has proven that &quot;R&quot;-rated films are by far the most popular with the movie-going public, the producers of this motion picture have asked me to take this opportunity to say fuck you.
Finished.
They're gone.
Hardy?
Aah!
What have we here,
Miss &quot;shouldn't be on the float anyway&quot;?
Wait a minute.
No!
No. I--
I didn't do it!
I didn't do it!
I never do it!
3 down.
This is the anatomy of the frog, and here, thousands of years later, man.
Quite a difference, huh, class?
And yet is he perfect?
I think not.
This is totally unnecessary, ugly, and gets in the way.
Now...
I can't believe about all this talk about Toby being involved in these murders.
It isn't true.
She's reflecting very poorly on our school.
If she has any sense of self-honor and decency, she'd kill herself.
Now, we can't go around changing men's anatomy, legally, that is. But we can change a frog's.
Now if you will all please expose your frogs.
First, we will remove all these ugly little frog penises.
[frog croaks]
Cigarette?
Ok. I'll come straight to the point.
You're the murderer.
No. That's impossible!
I wouldn't hurt a fly.
[fly buzzing]
The girl's obviously a liar.
Let's give her the chair.
If you want, I can saw her head off.
Now wait a minute.
May I make a suggestion?
Instead of sending Toby directly to jail--
What? And let her pass go and collect $200?
No way.
No, I meant it would be a good idea if Toby saw our school psychiatrist before we came to any firm conclusions.
I don't believe in psychiatrists.
What did they ever do for me?
Obviously nothing.
Dr. Sigmund is an eminently--imm-- a top man who has treated many murderers before they killed.
I feel strongly that the proper course of action is a thorough psychiatric consultation. Ok?
No.
I don't think so.
Good. Then it's settled.
Good-bye, and thanks for your confidence in me, Mr. Peters.
It's not really confidence, my dear.
I think you're crazy.
Now let's examine the evidence again.
Now, here are the murder weapons.
Now, who would logically have access to them?
One paperclip.
Harlow, that's yours.
3 trash bags. Now who could these belong to?
What's he doing?
This used to be the rest room before they remodeled the building, and Malvert thinks it's still here.
I keep a trash can over there for just this purpose.
Better to be safe than sorry.
Of course, the man deserves some respect.
He was a teacher before the accident.
What accident?
Oh, he was in a terrible crash, he got rammed from both the front and the back at the same time.
Poor fellow got whiplash in both directions.
Poor soul. Once a teacher, now a janitor.
He does enjoy the raise in pay.
Malvert afford hookers.
All done?
No. [urinates]
Now done.
You can't get angry with him.
He gets teased unmercifully.
Wait a minute.
Now, he could be our man.
Look at him.
Look at him!
He's got blood on his hands.
No. Since accident,
Malvert sometimes pee red.
You know good urologist?
[telephone rings]
I'll get it. I'm farthest from the phone.
Miss Mumsley :
That makes sense.
[ring]
[spring breaks]
[ring]
Hello.
Hello! I won't beat around the bush.
I killed everybody, and I 'm glad! Heh heh!
I appreciate your honesty.
What makes your voice sound so funny?
I'm disguising it, schmuck.
How?
By talking through a rubber chicken.
I thought it sounded like you were speaking through a rubber chicken.
Listen, I 'm going to kill next at the football game.
Click!
Did you hang up?
No. I just said click.
[dial tone]
Well, who was that?
The killer-- chicken lips.
And if that was the killer, then Malvert can't be guilty.
You can go,
Malvert.
Damn. Malvert never get picked!
[bell rings]
I've never been to a shrink before.
What do I say?
Tell him anything he wants to hear.
I don't know what to tell.
Just don't let him give you a lobotomy like they did to Jack Nicholson in Cuckoo's Nest.
No,
I don't think so.
That would really mess you up. Don't worry.
I'm scared.
It's routine.
[sniffles] I 'm sorry.
I promised myself
I wouldn't cry.
That's ok. It's all right to cry.
Perhaps this will help.
I'm sorry
I'm out of Kleenex.
Thank you, Dr. Sigmund.
Don't be so formal.
Call me Pischer.
Toby,
I'm going to ask you a difficult question.
Are you up for it?
I--I think so,
Dr. Sigmund.
Please, don't be so formal.
Call me daddy.
Daddy? Wouldn't that be unusual?
Not really, Toby.
You see, some day
I hope to be famous, a father image to the disturbed.
All I need is one...
[heavy breathing]
Sensational case.
Multiple personality, perhaps.
Proof that reincarnation does exist, perhaps.
The devil as a patient, perhaps.
Perhaps... perhaps... perhaps...perhaps... perhaps.
Somebody's been using my office.
[heavy breathing]
Tell me, Toby... how do you feel about sex?
What?
Did I pronounce it right?
Well...
You mean between a man and a woman.
Yes. Or the species of your choice.
Well... well, I think that-- that sex can be a beautiful thing if 2 people are in love and-- and are married and can share and care for one another.
Uh-huh.
2 souls blending into one.
2 hot bodies pressed
 against each other's flesh!
Stop!
But at the same time, it can be so ugly and-- and dirty and disgusting.
Yuck. My father--
Your father's name was yuck?
Tell me about your father.
Did you like yuck?
Oh, no. I hated him.
When I was a child, he used to beat me and lock me in my room with him in it!
Don't call me daddy anymore.
Well, he-- he told me that sex was bad and--and dirty and-- and your mother?
What did she tell you?
She also told me that sex was bad and dirty, but only with my father.
With everyone else, she said it was great.
[sobbing]
Thank you.
Your fellow students who were murdered, they had sex, didn't they, Toby?
Yes, but I tried to warn them.
But the police say you may be involved in these murders.
Why would I kill my best friends?
Listen, you've gotta believe me!
I believe you, Toby.
But sometimes the mind plays strange tricks.
We do things and afterwards we don't remember doing them.
[pipe clunks]
We become forgetful.
Did you know that forgetfulness was classified as a mental illness?
I didn't do anything
I wasn't aware of.
[bell rings]
And--and I don't feel so well now, and I 'd like to return to class, please.
Of course.
We'll continue some other time.
Good-bye, Sybil,
Uh, eve.
Toby.
Toby.
Today, we will discuss shakespeare's Hamlet.
Who was Hamlet?
His dog.
His dog?
Wasn't he a Great Dane?
[students laugh]
Class!
In all my years of teaching, that is the stupidest answer
I have ever heard.
Go back to grammar school.
I know where it is.
I'll show you.
Whoa!
Ok, ok.
Be careful! Hey, where's your seeing eye dog?
Sorry, man. He stole my car and everything.
My legs, my legs!
Hamlet is one of shakespeare's greatest tragedies.
It is the story of a prince, the prince of Denmark, a melancholy man whose mother is sleeping with his uncle.
I can relate to that.
And how does he solve this problem?
Students: Murder!
Sorry I 'm late.
Take your seat, please.
Peters on P.A.:
Attention, students.
As principal, I am obligated to report that Toby Badger has just come from a psychiatric session with Dr. Sigmund.
While Dr. Sigmund has not reached any formal conclusion, he does however feel there is strong evidence that Toby may indeed be the psychotic killer we've been all looking for.
But until this is confirmed at a later date, please treat her just like any other student.
Murderer!
Bye, killer.
There, there, Harlow.
Don't fret.
You do have a lot on your mind.
A lot on my mind?
The big day, the big game, the big parade,
6 big deaths-- you'd call that a lot on my mind?
Here, speak to the student bodies.
You know how you like having your voice amplified.
Good afternoon, students.
This is Mr. Peters, your principal.
I have some good news and some bad news.
The good news is the killer has definitely been identified as a psychotic individual suffering from paranoiac schizophrenia.
He is armed and dangerous.
The bad news is we have no idea who it is.
If anyone should come across an individual matching this description, please call me at once, but don't do it in front of him.
And remember, the big football game...
Mr. Malvert,
I wanted to talk to you.
If for some reason suspicion should fall on our dear Mr. Peters, we would like you to confess.
Well, Mr. Peters is a valuable asset to society, while you are mere scum.
What difference would jail make to you?
You'll have fun with the boys.
Women don't like you much now.
I certainly don't.
Homosexuality is the up-and-coming thing.
[band playing]
Call again.
Mine.
[blows whistle]
[crowd cheering]
All right! Come on!
Man, wheels, how'd you get such great seats?
The 50-yard line.
Yeah, I used my influence.
Give me the money.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
[band playing]
[crowd cheering]
Red hots! Hot dogs!
Peanuts!
Give me a hot dog.
Here's your hot dog.
You want mustard?
Yeah, give me some--
How about something to drink?
Yeah, gi--
[gulps]
Hot dog.
Hot dog!
Here's your hot dog.
Here's your hot dog.
Here, you want mustard, too?
Here you are.
Peanuts!
Here.
I'm gonna buy you a hot dog.
Then you'll like Malvert.
Hot dog!
Malvert: Slut! Slut!
All women alike!
All women with Malvert.
I still think the boys are being killed and then stuffed in the trash bags.
Not necessarily.
It's a well-known fact that if you put a male inside a 3-ply hefty bag, tightly tied at the top, they'll suffocate in a matter of minutes.
You can believe me.
That's how they were murdered.
You're on. Hey, chief, get over here.
Yes, sir?
Get in the bag.
Why?
Because
I told you so.
Yes, sir.
Oof!
[blows whistle]
[blows whistle]
[thumping]
I'm bad.
That's right. I'm bad.
Hey, blood. Hey, bro.
What's happenin'?
Hey, blood. Whoo!
[crowd cheering]
Try to get out.
[whistle blows]
All right.
Come on!
This is boring.
The game sucks anyway.
Excuse me. I have to make a phone call.
I got a phone right here.
I feel like grabbing a quick shave.
Oh? I used to be a barber.
I just remembered
I must pick up my daughter at the airport.
Daddy, daddy, the plane was early!
I'm back!
Come on. Everybody will be watching the game.
Stop! Look at all this crap!
Come on, baby.
Come on.
No. Al, let's stop.
It's cold.
All this garbage is falling.
The garbage gets me hot.
Ohh!
Ok, ok, stay here.
I'll get a blanket and a broom.
Ok. Hurry, hurry.
I'm going.
Wrong time. Don't!
I'm just gonna keep an eye on her.
Toby.
[heavy breathing]
[breath catches]
Heeeere's Breather!
Al? An eraser?!
Aah!
[crowd cheering]
Joan?
Al?
I saw you guys come down here, and I just don't think is a very good idea.
[thud]
Ohh!
Joan, I 've got 'em.
Best broom and blanket money can buy.
Joan?
You look terrible.
What's this white powder?
Ecch, cut with chalk.
Joan?
No! No! No!
[crowd cheering]
[whistle blows]
[heavy breathing]
[whistle blows]
[team cheers]
Referee: No touchdown.
Dead bodies on field.
15-yard penalty.
Take off.
[blows whistle]
All right, listen up now.
There's been another double murder.
A killer is among us.
All you people who have had no previous duress for criminal charges, leave the stadium.
All those who have had no motives in connection with this killing, you can go home.
[crowd murmuring]
All right, now.
All those whose parents are of the same sex, you can go.
Damn. Question was too obvious.
Sheriff: Well, hell, we ain't got no suspect.
Peters: Where's Toby Badger?
Has anybody seen her?
Sheriff: No, not me.
She's been found on the scene of all the crimes.
Sheriff: Well, sounds like the killer to me.
Ok, I want everyone deputized.
Spread out and reconnoiter the area.
Any questions?
Yes, Dr. Sigmund.
Dr. Sigmund: Yes, where did you learn to speak English, a zoo?
I understand this killer strikes only those who are having sex.
That could wipe out the entire senior class.
Wait a minute!
No students leave the school grounds without filling out the proper forms.
But they're dead.
Nurse: If we make an exception for the dead, we have to make an exception for everyone!
I better get my forms.
[engine starts]
[siren]
Damn it, son.
We've been here for 2 hours now, and we're not letting you go anywhere until you tell us where the murderess is of these 2 young bodies.
Now, tell me, boy, have you ever seen a dead body? Huh?
Well, now, has anybody in this room ever seen a dead body?
Now talk, boy.
I'm not a suspect, and you can't keep me here any longer, and if you had any decency, you'd remove these bodies.
[farts]
There's something in the air.
Ok. Who had beans for lunch?
Who did it?
He did.
Peters:
But he's dead.
Nurse:
It's a well-known fact that corpses can pass wind, urinate, have erections.
There's an old
Welsh saying--
&quot;Dead men tell no tales, but they fart.&quot; this investigation's going nowhere.
I'm getting out of here.
[ring]
That was a high-pitched one.
That was the phone.
Hello.
Hello again.
Chicken lips again.
Put him on the speakerphone.
I will kill next at the prom.
Oh, yeah? Click.
Did you hang up?
No. I just said click.
Ha ha. I got him.
[farts]
Eww! God!
Coach:
Don't you leave town.
[whispering]
Toby.
Toby.
Toby, wake up.
I didn't do it.
Toby, it's me,
Hardy.
Hardy, where am I?
[sniffs]
Cleveland?
Ugh!
Oh, Hardy, it was so awful under there.
The worst is over.
[farts]
Toby: Aah!
[crash]
Hardy, you saved me.
That's Ok.
You owe me one.
What is all this?
It's from the junior class play.
They're doing a nonmusical version of Grease.
They couldn't get the rights to the music.
I'm gonna have to get you out of here.
No, I have to go to the prom and find the killer.
But you can't do that.
They'll grab you.
It's the only way to save my name.
How are you going to get past the entrance?
I--I 'll have my hand stamped or something.
I mean they'll recognize you.
Besides, wouldn't that be counterproductive?
I'll go in disguise.
I--I need 2 balloons.
Oh. I happen to have 2... in case I got lucky.
Hardy, can you please wait outside?
I could wait here.
Ahem. Outside.
Breather: We have temporarily lost our picture.
Please stand by.
Just kidding.
[heavy breathing]
Hello! It's me, the Breather.
You're probably wondering who I am.
Who could I be?
Could I be the innocent-looking Toby?
Would you trust a girl who looks like Prince Valiant in a plum sweater?
Maybe I 'm Dr. Sigmund, a man who was once arrested for corrupting the morals of a hooker.
Then there's Malvert, with the I.Q. Of a handball and the personality of a parking meter.
Violated.
Could I be the principal
Mr. Peters, a man who keeps cheese in his underwear to attract mice?
Let's not forget
Ms. Leclair--
English teacher by day and English teacher by night.
Ah, Miss Mumsley.
She eats 12 prunes a day and nothing happens.
Nurse Krud and Miss Van Dyke.
What's in a name?
Everything.
Then there's Dumpkin, a man who sleeps with his nuts between horse head bookends.
Toby! You look so different.
I put a wig on, and I--
I put these balloons up here.
They look great.
Can you keep them?
You can have them when I 'm through.
Now, listen,
I've been thinking.
All the clues have to be in Mr. Peters' office.
What makes you think that?
Well, that's where they've been holding the investigations and all the important evidence.
It's--it's got to be there.
That does make sense to me.
Somehow I 've got to get Mr. Peters' keys.
Hey, who is that chick?
I don't know, but what a great set of balloons.
Ignore them.
Come on, stick close to me.
Hardy, I can't go to the prom with you.
Everyone knows I 'm the only friend you have.
Hardy.
Hardy, you'll blow my cover.
All right,
I'll go in alone, but I 'm gonna keep my eye on you.
Ok.

Hi there, big boy.
Oh! I'm sorry.
Well, you look so young, and I thought you were a student. Heh.
You're the principal, aren't you?
Yes, uh... do I know you, my dear?
Well,
I don't think so.
See, I just transferred here, and with you being so busy and all.
Principal.
Such an important job.
Why, just look at all those keys.
Indeed, I 've got heavy responsibilities.
Aw, poor thing.
May I ask where you come from?
[groans]
Harlow, you're not mingling.
I'm telling you, that's her.
She wants my crown.
I'll find out.
I'll go dance with her.
If I don't get a hard-on, it's Toby for sure.

I want you to remember this moment forever.
I will.
And who knows?
Maybe when this is all over, maybe we can kiss again.
But right now, I--
I know.
You're in danger.
What can I do to help?
[mumbles]
Check all the outside windows.
See if there's any way in.
Then check
Miss Mumsley 's office.
She's like
Peters' clone.
She could
 be involved, too.
I've gotta go get those keys.
All right.
Mr. Malvert.
Don't scare Malvert.
You know Malvert?
Yes, I know Malvert.
Remember 5-letter word for stealth-like movement?
Mrs. Malvert!
Yes, yes, Mrs. Malvert.
Listen, you've gotta come help me.
Malvert come.
[panting]
Where is it?
Yeah, where is it?
We gotta make horse head bookend.
[machine hammering]
Mr. Peters treats you badly like the others, doesn't he?
Yes, he mean to Malvert.
Then you can help me and get even.
How?
Listen...
♪ Why don't you say what you mean? ♪

[laughter]

♪ Mean what you say ♪
Down, Malvert.
Down!
Did you get them?
Uhh! I said his keys, not his cheese.
Oh. Oh, Malvert, you're wonderful.
[balloons squeak]
Miss Mumsley :
Students, quiet, please.
Students.
[music stops]
[gunshot ricochets, glass breaks]
Thank you for your courtesy.
I have a special announcement.
Since all of the prom queen candidates have been killed except miss Patti Priswell, the teachers' committee has decided it would be inappropriate to award the crown to a student this year.
They can't do this.
We can do anything we want.
We're teachers.
Boy: Teachers suck!
And so we have decided to award the crown this year to a king-- a king of learning-- your principal
Harlow Hebrew Peters!
[all booing]
[crying]
Patti, stop it!
[sobbing]
Oh, I want to slash my face.
Oh, if I can't be the prettiest girl in school,
I want to be the ugliest.
Come on, Patti,
I understand this incredible sense of loss you must be feeling.
It's a very trying moment for a tender girl like yourself.
But I want you to know, underneath this uniform is the best body in this school.
Let's ball.
[shuts machine off]
Was it good for you?
Scott:
'Cause he's my hero.
Patti: What if someone finds us?
Patti... double time.
At ease.
I'm nervous.
There's nothing to be nervous about.
I'm worried.
What are you worried about?
I'm scared.
Would you pipe down and strip?
I wanna get this over with before you change your mind.
I've changed my mind.
What if the murderer should find us?
How's he gonna find us here?
I can't do it with all these horse heads staring at me.
I can't help it.
These horse heads make me hot.
[whispering]
Horse heads?
[clunk]
What was that?
Rahr!
I heard heavy breathing.
It's me.
Look, it's safe.
I got protection.
You don't have one, and don't try to tell me you've had a vasectomy.
Please don't pull that line.
Look, I know where I can get one.
Where?
I planned an occasion like this last summer.
I got one planted upstairs.
[chuckles]
Where are you going?
Behind the men's room toilet.
Ha! You're crazy.
I got the idea from Godfather I.
Wait here, and don't open the door for anyone but me.
That's an order, soldier.
[laughs]
[rumbling]
Scott?
Scott?
[rumbling growing louder]
Aah!
Who is it?
[heavy breathing]
Oh, it's you!
You brought me the crown.
Oh, I 'm prom queen after all.
Aah!
[machine gun fire, explosions, sirens]
[train bell ringing]
[noises stop]
All right, soldier.
You countermanded a direct order by leaving that door open, and as soon as we're done here, you're gonna police the whole area.
Scott: Patti?
[singsong]
Just kidding.
Look, another minute,
I'll have my clothes off, and, uh... we'll break the rules together.
And don't worry about it-- one fully-tested safety, government-issued, and I even cleaned my weapon.
Patti?
Patti, you finally got your crown.
Mother of god and country, you're dead.
Let's have one for old times' sake.
Bleah.
Well, I won't be needing this.
[heavy breathing]
Who is that?
Who's there?
Hey, I 'm trying to get laid here.
[heavy breathing]
No!
Aah!
[rustling]
[heavy breathing]
Aw, poor kids.
They bought the farm.
At least I 'm safe.
[chain saw buzzing]
Feet, do your stuff!
[heavy breathing]
What are you doing?
What's up with the saw?
Ohh, I get it.
I get it.
You're the killer.
[chain saw buzzes]
Look, you've killed
10 people already.
11 is the legal limit in this state.
Best thing you can do is just unplug the chain saw and--and hand it over to me.
[buzz]
Keep it.
What do you want, my life?
What would you
 do with it?
Take my car.
It's a gorgeous k-car.
I just washed it an hour ago.
I buy Japanese.
[heavy breathing]
Ooh, better idea.
While you got the buzz saw,
I'll teach you how to make horse head bookends for all your books.
Ah, ptuh!
Ah, you probably don't have much time for reading, what with your schedule.
Only smut.
Please... from one sicko to another,
I'm begging you...
[chuckles]
[crying]
Mommy... mommy.
[chain saw buzzing]
Ah ah ah ah.
Not bad.
Ahh.
Were you gonna use that-- that on flesh?
Uh-huh.
Where's your rotary?
That's for wood.
Huh? Ahh!
I can see the heavy breathing, but shut off the buzz saw.
[chain saw shuts off]
Good.
Now, this is what you gotta do.
First, unplug the buzz saw.
Good.
Now oil it and clean it.
[sprays oil]
Wipe that grease off.
Ahh!
Good.
Now put it back in the case.
[heavy breathing]
Put it back on the shelf where it belongs.
[thunk]
Ha ha ha.
[keys jingling]
[balloons squeak]
[rattling]
[balloons squeak]
Harlow, Harlow, where are you going?
I'm gonna check my office.
I think
I lost my keys and my cheese.
[marbles rattling]
Toby, thinking:
Harlot.
Slut.
Floozie.
Bad girl.
Whore.
Bimbo.
Toby.
Oh.
Oh, Mr. Peters.
You-- you startled me.
I wouldn't want to do that.
Um...
I wanted to thank you for having
Dr. Sigmund, um, have those sessions with me.
It was very helpful.
Oh?
And that's why you're here in my office?
Yes!
Yes, that's right.
Toby, I 'm curious.
Did you expect to find me in the filing cabinet?
Oh. Oh, that.
Oh, you mean these?
Well, I was looking at these pictures, and--and, well,
I couldn't wait for the yearbook to come out.
Is that so, Toby?
No. Um... do you really want to know the truth?
Yes, Toby.
Tell me the truth.
[sighs] Well-- well, the truth is-- it's that-- well, as you know, everyone suspects me of having something to do with the murders, like me being the murderer.
And--and--and so
I was just thinking--
Yes, go on, Toby.
What were you thinking?
Well, to tell you the truth,
I didn't know what to think.
You're a bright girl, Toby.
Surely you have some theory developed by now.
Well, yes, as a matter of fact,
I think that the murderer knew all the victims.
Yes, go on.
And he must've had access to the school...
Good. Good.
Because of the murder weapons.
Toby: Someone who's immature and crazy and-- and deranged and-- and someone who wanted to see harm come to the students.
Someone like-- someone like the principal.
Yes, someone like the principal.
Mr. Peters!
You're naked!
Yes, Toby.
All these years
I've been secretly naked underneath my clothes.
But did anyone notice?
Any girls?
Any prom queen candidates?
No.
All those lithesome budding bodies changing from girlhood to womanhood, like moths into butterflies, year after year, right before my eyes.
Do you realize how that affects a man?
Um... it makes you hot?
That's right, Toby.
It makes me...hot.
Especially the naughty ones like Julie and Bertha and Joan and Dagmar.
[heavy breathing]
Do you want to know why
I think they were murdered?
No. Yes!
Why?
Because they were naughty.
Naughty?
Disgustingly naughty.
Each and every one of them was caught doing...sex.
Sex? Yuck!
That's right, Toby.
Yecch.
Sex is dirty and sex is bad.
Yes. Yes, I agree.
I-- well, I don't know.
I've never really done it.
But you would like to do it, wouldn't you?
Yes. No! No.
Excuse me a moment.
I'll be right back.
What--what are you going to do?
Have you ever seen our school trophy, Toby?
No, I--
I never knew we ever won a trophy.
Oh, we did.
In 20 years, we only won one trophy.
Ahh, the typing team really came through that year.
Typing team?
We retired the typewriter, but we kept the trophy.
I'll be back.
[door closes]
[ringing]
Hello?
Hello, um--
Listen, I 'm in terrible danger and I need some help.
Recording: You have reached the police.
We are closed.
Look out behind you!
[gasps]
I'm back again.
Look.
Look behind you.
You're not going to fool me with that old trick.
See? I was right.
This is our trophy, Toby.
Look!
No!
[bell clanking]
Miss Mumsley : Well, she's not in the men's room.
Malvert:
When we catch her, can Malvert kill her first, ok?
Ok, but I get first crack at her.
[voices arguing]
Dr. Sigmund: hello, all.
Dr. Sigmund, what are you doing here?
And what's that hideous creature at the end of the leash?
I tamper with nature as a hobby.
I crossed a flounder with a walrus and a horny toad.
What did you get?
A fish with warts and a mustache that can't get a date.
It really belongs in a zoo.
Thanks, but they refused it.
Well, good night.
She's got to be here someplace.
I'll look in the men's room.
Malvert: Ok.
Aah!
Ohh.
Aah! Hardy!
Hardy!
Hardy! Hardy!
Hardy, I killed
Mr. Peters, and I think he's a murderer, and everything's so horrible!
Hardy--
Aaaah!
Ohhh!
He's dead, my dear, just like the others.
I didn't have time to bag him.
Miss Mumsley!
Yes, Miss Mumsley.
Do you think
I look good in green?
Why, yes, I think it's quite flattering.
Thank you.
Too bad you have to die.
You're the only one of the girls who didn't get laid first.
Then you did it.
I only kill the boys.
He killed the girls.
It breaks up the monotony.
But why?
Why not?
I never told him.
He had no idea.
I did it to protect him in case there were any witnesses.
I don't understand.
Because he was my son.
You're his mother?!
No, his father.
Oh, my god!
Father-mother.
But why did you do it?
Because I loved him.
Listen, please let me go and-- and I won't tell anyone you're crazy.
I swear!
Hold still while I kill you.
I'm an old woman with arthritis.
[horse whinnies]
[horse nickers]
[cackling laugh]
Ohh!
Hee hee hee!
[creaks]
[squeaking]
[gorilla roars]
Ha ha ha!
[gunshot echoing]
Aah!
[all laughing]
[monstrous roaring]
This way out.
Ohh!
Aah!
Toby, snap out of it.
Snap out of it, Toby.
[gasps]
Hardy?
Julie.
Bertha.
Toby: Patti and Scott, you're all alive!
You're all alive and-- and you're who you are in real life.
Oh, Mr. Dumpkin,
I had this dream and-- and you weren't even my French teacher!
I will always be your French teacher.
But you were surrounded by all these horse heads.
Qu'est-ce que c'est,
 a horse head?
You must've had a terrible dream, no?
A terrible dream?
It was a nightmare.
Oh, this swine flu really affected my mind.
I--I dreamt that all my friends were murdered because they were having sex.
Sounds reasonable.
Toby: Mr. Mumsley, you were a woman.
And Mr. Peters, you were the principal and-- it's all due to sexual repression and urban stress, my dear.
So who was the murderer?
Luke, you can walk.
Yeah, I have been since I was 2 years old.
And Mr. Malvert, you were a janitor.
Absurd!
No, really,
I was at this prom and-- and there was this weird red punch.
Sometimes,
Peters pee red.
While you were unconscious, we all felt so sorry for you that, well, the gang voted you prom queen.
It was
Patti Priswell 's idea.
But, Patti, all through my dream all you wanted was the crown.
It's all I wanted in my dreams, too.
Will you put these in water for me?
Sure.
In any event, people,
Toby needs her rest.
We can all visit her tomorrow.
Don't forget your appointment on Tuesday, my dear.
Bye-bye.
What was I like in your dream?
Well, besides me, you were the only one who was normal.
Yeah.
Boring, isn't it?
Nope.
Boring gets me hot.
And I don't have any more nightmares.
Good.
Dr. Sigmund told me that sexual repression causes swine flu, so I think it's time for me to do it.
Here? Now?
Ok.
All I ask is that you just turn your back while I undress, ok?
Yes.
And I 'll slip into something more comfortable.
[heavy breathing]
Hardy.
Hardy, what are you doing with those rubber gloves on?
Hardy, why are you breathing so heavy?
I'm the killer.
Hardy, you're not the killer.
You're my friend, remember?
That was a dream.
This is reality.
Why are you doing this?
I don't know.
I guess I 'm just that kind of guy!
Aah! Aah!
Uhh!
Hardy, no!
I know it's unusual for a psychiatrist to speak at a funeral, but this was my client.
The latest victim,
Toby Badger, just laid to rest.
She suffered severe social repression, countered by an expressed nausea towards sex, which led to severe social alienation causing huge psychological problems, leading to the greatest psychological problem of them all, death.
Let us pay our final respects, but the living must go on and make a new beginning, hopefully in a spirit of openness and sharing of grief, individually or in groups.
I'm sorry I had to kill you, Toby.
You just shouldn't have done it.
I lost respect, but I do still love you.
Others have only brought you one flower, but I 've brought you 2.
And if we should ever meet again--
Aah!
[choking]
Grandmother's house.
Though it's been many years since I last saw it,
I'll always remember that even my first impression...
was one of fear and wonder.
My childhood was soon to be lost,
my innocence shattered,
and all our dreams destroyed...
by what we would find within.
My Mother and Father were the center of my universe when I was young,
and I always wanted to grow up to be just like mom.
The whole family was really close.
I still remember...
how we'd greet dad when he came home from one of his many business trips.
He's home!
- Get Cory and Carrie.
- Yeah. Come on, guys! Hurry up!
- Hurry! Come on!
- Daddy!
Come on, Carrie.
Get behind the couch.
Get down. Get down, get down, get down.
Daddy! Dad!
Yeah. Yeah! How you doin'?
He loved us all, but dad never let me forget...
that I was his favorite.
I was afraid the others might be jealous, so I had to wait until they all went to bed.
But you give me so much.
Just tell me what you think.
And you see?
It's a jewel box as well.
The moment I saw that box,
I knew you had to have it.
Oh!
Mother, how should I arrange the candles?
I can have six rows of six or three rows of 12.
Or just one big circle of
36 all around the cake.
What happened to two lines of 18?
Couldn't you figure that one out?
We want to taste daddy's cake!
We want to taste icing.
- And lick the bowl!
- And the spoon too!
Don't you look handsome and pretty?
But we have to wait until we sing...
"Happy Birthday" to daddy before we eat the cake.
- Can't we even have an little bite?
- Yeah!
And give dad a cake that looks like a mouse has been nibbling at it?
I've decided I'm gonna do six rows of six.
- It's daddy!
- Cathy, dad's here! Come on out!
Get down. Hurry. Get down here.
No!
When dad died,
Mother's grief overwhelmed her.
We had to sell everything we owned just to survive.
And when that money ran out, they took our house.
We were forced to leave the place where we all grew up,
where all our happy memories were,
the only home I'd ever known.
Mother said there was only one place left to go.
How come you never took us to meet the grandparents before?
I suppose because we were never penniless before.
Years and years ago, I did something that angered your Grandfather.
His punishment was to disinherit me.
Then why are we going there now?
If they won't give us any money?
Because he will.
Your Grandfather is dying.
He's not expected to live much longer.
But in that time, I'm going to win back his love.
And then, darlings,
I'll be the heiress to a fortune beyond your imaginations.
And through me, every dream you've ever had will come true.
Mother should have prepared us for something like this.
What do you mean?
She never allowed us to have a dog or a kitten.
What that's got to do with anything?
Because pets die, Christopher.
And if we had had a pet and it had died, we would have learned something about that.
- About what? About death?
- Yes, death. Death.
She should have told us. Somebody should have told us that fathers die too.
They die, Christopher,
Even if they're young and they're handsome and we need them.
I don't want to be here, Christopher.
I don't want to go to the grandparents' house.
I could care less about being rich and having all my dreams come true.
All I want is to be at home and just stay at home where daddy's memory is.
I don't want to walk at night. It's scary.
Why didn't they send a car for us.
Witches in there, mama.
Witches and monsters.
Good morning, John.
Children, this is John.
He's been with your grandparents for... well, as long as I can remember.
This is Christopher and Cathy... and the twins, Cory and Carrie.
Very nice to meet you, John.
Hello, Mother.
Leave all the bags with John, Corrine, and bring the children upstairs.
Let's get ready for bed, children.
Stay tonight, mama.
It's only 6:00 in the morning, sweetheart.
Mama's got to take a little nap herself.
With us?
The boys will sleep in one bed,
Corrine, the girls in the other.
But I want to sleep with Cory, mama.
Stop your whimpering, young lady, and listen to me.
As long as you're in this house, you will abide by my rules.
You will not yell... or cry or run about.
And when your Mother and I leave this room, we will lock this door behind us.
Mother, please, they're children.
You can't expect me to...
What I expect, Corrine, is that they will do precisely as I've instructed.
Listen to mom, all of you.
Behave and obey your Grandmother... and never ever give her any reason, any reason at all, to punish you.
Please? Please do this.
Make them obey.
Make it seem like a game, like a wonderful adventure.
Why are you crying, Mother?
I'll come back this afternoon.
Don't worry about us, mom.
We'll be fine.
It won't be so bad.
That Grandmother... she can't possibly be as mean as she seems.
Remember, God sees everything.
God will see whatever evil you do behind my back, and he will punish you for it.
Do you know why your
Mother has come home?
Yes. To win back her Father's love... so he'll make her part of his will again.
And why was she stricken from that will? Did she tell you that?
I have to go to the bathroom.
Be silent.
Learn control.
And never, never speak unless I ask you a question.
- He's just a little boy...
- What did I just say?
Your Mother has come home after 17 years... to repent for her sins and for her crimes... not only against your Grandfather and me... but against God.
Your Mother's marriage was unholy, a sacrilege, an abomination in the eyes of the lord.
She did not fall from grace.
She leapt... into the arms of a man whose veins pulsed with the same blood as hers.
Not a stranger, but her own uncle.
And you, the children, are the devil's spawn.
Evil from the moment of conception.
- I'm getting my Mother!
- Come back here!
Come back here.
Sit down.
And don't move again until I leave.
There is one other matter.
Your Grandfather will not be told that you are here.
He will never be told.
He has no idea that you even exist... any of you.
No idea that you were ever born.
As long as he lives... and I swear this to you...
I will spare him that final agony of shame.
I don't like it here, Cathy.
I wanna go home.
Mama!
Where have you been, mama?
Where have you been?
Oh, mama's here.
Mama's here. Mama's here.
What's wrong, mom?
What happened to you?
Corrine! You will stop those children's screaming this very moment!
- Mother!
- No! Devil!
Mama, make her stop!
Corrine, control your children or I'll whip them till the blood runs from their backs!
Your children are spoiled and indulged and need lessons in obedience.
No child that lives under this roof... will disobey... or scream, or show defiance.
Do you hear me?
Do you?
Now, remove your blouse, daughter, and show them how punishment is given in this house.
If you're cruel to my children,
I'll take them away tonight.
Take them, Corrine.
Take them now! Do you think I care?
Take off the blouse, Corrine.
Take it off.
Now, look closely, children.
Seventeen lashes.
One for each year she lived in sin with your Father.
So that you understand me now.
I will give you food and shelter, but never kindness or love.
For it is impossible to feel anything but disgust... for what is not wholesome.
It's better.
- If I had some antiseptic...
- My young doctor.
The years of happiness I had with your
Father are worth a hundred whippings.
The things that Grandmother said to us, Mother, they are ugly things.
They hurt you, mom. I hate them for that.
The worst is over.
Beginning tomorrow,
I'm going to start to win back my Father's love.
If you help me, if all of you help me... by doing what I ask, by being good...
I'll succeed.
The closet on the right has a secret panel.
Look for it tomorrow morning.
If you push on it gently, it'll open.
You'll see a narrow stairway.
Up the stairs is an attic, an attic so big... you could easily get lost in it.
Make it a playground for the twins. Make it...
Make it your special place.
Do you need to use the bathroom?
No.
Not even to brush your teeth?
I don't feel like it tonight.
What do you think about all that talk?
Uncles marrying nieces?
Maybe having kids with thorns and tails?
You're the future doctor.
What do you think?
Could it really happen?
You sure can't prove it by us.
- What are you thinking?
- About mom.
How different she's become since daddy died.
She hasn't been different. Just sad.
We're sad, too, Christopher.
It hasn't changed who we are.
What if the Grandmother comes in before we wake up and sees us in the same bed?
Then we'll sic Cory on her.
He can bite her other leg.
- She doesn't scare you?
- Nobody scares me.
Anyway, we used to sleep in the same bed all the time.
I've listed the rules you're to follow as long as you live in my house.
Read them carefully and put them to memory.
Grab some food. We don't want to starve up there.
Let's go find those stairs.
- I found it.
- What do you see, Christopher?
Nothing to see from here.
Just some stairs.
Is everybody ready to go up?
Not yet. Your Mother was given permission to tell you about the attic.
But let me remind you again.
You must never be seen.
My God.
Grandmother's rules weren't rules,
they were cruel punishments.
We were trapped, and the only way we could even feel the sunlight...
was to look out a barred window.
Our Mother must've been desperate to have come back.
We were all going to pay the price.
As the weeks became months,
our memories of our real home began to fade.
But we clung to our dreams.
Chris wanted to go to medical school someday,
and I wanted to be a dancer.
We tried to act like a family.
It was the only way we could survive.
Mother's visits became fewer and fewer,
and then stopped altogether.
We imagined that something horrible had happened to her.
Or had we been forgotten?
There seemed to be no way to escape, but soon, very soon,
we'd have to find a way past Grandmother...
to find and to help
Mother if we could.
Do you think it's a good snail?
I think it's a wonderful snail.
It's very beautiful.
It doesn't look like an orange?
Not in the very least.
And I've never seen an orange with feelers. Have you?
Antennae, Cathy. Not feelers.
Snails are members of the family of Mollusks... soft bodies, no backbones,
And tubular intestines that end with their mouths.
Dear Dr. Christopher.
When Cory and I want to hear... about a snail's guts, then we will... send you a telegram or something, thank you.
When do we get to go outside?
- As soon as mom says we can.
- But mama doesn't come anymore.
If we could go outside, we'd have real flowers and real grass.
And real snails.
God's taken all the grass to heaven.
- Why?
- For daddy.
Remember how he used to mow the lawn all the time?
Why do we have to stay upstairs all the time?
- 'Cause downstairs has gone away.
- That's not true, Cory.
Mama doesn't like us anymore.
- Stop it, you two.
- I itch.
Mama's being mean. We want a TV.
We want our ice cream.
We want to play with our friends.
We want to go outside.
- Don't you want to go to school?
- No!
Look at me. Look at me, all of you.
The bible says there's a time for everything.
A time to be born.
A time to plant. A time to harvest.
Probably a time to have ice cream too.
This is our time to sacrifice.
For mom.
Later on, we'll have plenty of time... to live and enjoy.
Cathy? Can I come in?
Close the door so we won't wake the twins.
Something could've happened to mom.
Maybe she's sick.
Mom's always been healthy as a horse.
Well, where's she been all this time?
Why'd she stop coming to see us?
And I had another thought.
- A terrible thought.
- What?
What if they've locked her up somewhere in this huge house?
Just like they've locked us up.
- Why would they want to do that?
- To punish her. Why do you think?
'Cause they're crazy as loons.
Gave me a chill.
Giving myself chills just thinking about it.
I'm sure it's not true.
How can you be sure?
Does it matter? We're never gonna know until she comes to see us again.
Oh, yeah?
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I've got a plan.
Christopher, what are you thinking of doing?
- Don't worry about it.
- Christopher!
You don't want to wake the twins.
Carrie, you're in the wrong bed.
I want to sleep with Cory tonight.
Get up! Get out of those beds!
Don't! Don't touch that! No!
My Father gave that to me!
Oh, God!
No!
Tell me, Christopher. You thought of a way out of here, haven't you?
Without the Grandfather finding out.
I've thought about it for weeks, Cathy.
It's the only thing I've been thinking about.
Can it be done?
Christopher, if Mother's here, we have to find her. We've got to tell her.
We will. Tonight.
Okay, grab the bar, Cathy.
Okay, pull it.
Come on, pull! Yeah.
That's it. Grab it.
Pull. Pull, Cathy.
I'm going with you.
- No chance.
- Yes!
All right. But I go first.
And you don't lay one hand on this rope till I get all the way down.
- You understand?
- I understand.
Be careful.
- Careful!
- Oh!
What?
My God.
Get out of here! Quick!
Come on! Come on!
Come on!
Christopher!
- Cathy!
- Christopher!
Come on, Christopher!
Come on! Throw the rope!
I can catch it!
Christopher, you can make it!
Just climb!
Come on, Christopher!
Mama?
Mama?
- Mama! Mama!
- Mama!
Oh!
- Christopher made me a swing, mama.
- And we made a garden of paper flowers.
Here! And Cathy has them pasted up right near the window!
You've been wonderful with them.
Look how happy they are.
Happy to see you, mama, but not happy to be here.
You haven't been to see us in so long, mom.
We were worried about you.
Is that why you tried to run away?
Is it? Answer me.
We weren't trying to run away, Mother.
We were trying to find you.
Didn't it occur to you you could've ruin my plan? Our plan?
Don't you understand? I told you.
- My Father...
- The twins aren't healthy, Mother.
They need to be outside in the fresh air and the sun.
They need to be with their friends.
They need plenty of room to run around, and they need to be in school.
All right. I'll leave it up to you.
- We can pack our things and leave today...
- Yes!
...or we can wait a little longer until the reading of the will.
Grandfather's dying?
The doctors say he won't live out the month.
If we leave now, we have nothing.
Nowhere to go.
If we stay, we... we'll have more than we could ever want... forever.
We love you, mom.
Whatever you think's best, that's what we'll do.
Cathy, you have a say in this too.
I think I'd better check on the twins.
We'll be all right, mom.
If it's just a little longer, we'll be all right.
Don't worry.
I've got him! I got him!
Christopher! I've got a pet!
"I hate vain thoughts, but thy law do I love.
Thou art my hiding place and my shield."
Christopher, come and look what happened.
Why did you put up more bars?
I knew Chris would have second thoughts about agreeing with Mother.
I found a way to escape, even if it was only to a hot bath and my fantasies...
fantasies of a life filled with dancing, friends, and maybe even romance.
Fantasies that might never come true.
- Cathy?
- Yes?
- Can I come in and talk?
- What is it?
You're not mad at me for siding with mom, are you?
No, but why do you always have to agree with her?
Sinners!
Christopher!
What have we done to be called sinners?
Do you expect us to live in one room, week after week, and not see each other?
You put us here.
You-you locked us in.
You want to catch us doing something you can call evil.
Look at you in your black dress and your fancy jewels and your pinched face.
We're not afraid of you.
We laugh at you. Do you hear that?
We laugh. Get out! Out! Out!
Mom won't let her do anything to hurt us, Cathy.
We have to barricade the door, or we'll hide in the attic.
She won't come up there.
I'm so scared, Christopher.
We'll be all right.
Mom'll make sure of that.
So will I.
Cory?
- What is it? What's wrong?
- Cory's gone.
Cory?
- Cory! Where are you?
- Cory! Cory!
- Cory!
- Cory!
Fred's gone.
Look, you guys go that way.
- Cory! Cory!
- Cory!
- Cory! Cory!
- Cory! Cory!
Cory?
- Cory!
- Cory!
Cory?
He's here.
Cory! Cory, wake up!
Wake up, honey! Come on!
Fred got out. I had to catch him again.
- Where is Fred?
- He's right here.
Guess we'd better keep
Fred downstairs?
Cathy!
Cathy. Cathy! Open the door!
Cathy! Come on. Open the door.
Cathy! Cathy!
- You are a sinner.
- Open the door!
Come on, open the door!
What's going on? Cathy!
Cathy! Cathy!
Why is Mother doing this to us?
Mom doesn't know what happened.
I'm sure of it.
Why doesn't she come back?
She'll come, Cathy.
Soon. You'll see.
Why didn't the Grandmother bring our food today?
She's just coming late, that's all.
Maybe there is no more food.
Maybe they ran out.
I'm not hungry anyway.
She'll be here.
Oh!
Oh!
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Mr. Winslow.
Starved for both sunlight and food,
our faces became pale and our bodies thin.
When Grandmother stopped feeding us, little Cory became very sick,
and every day, we watched him become weaker and weaker.
Move him over.
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Hold his head up.
- Why? What are you gonna do?
- Just do what I say.
I figured another way out.
I'm gonna try it tonight.
If you want to go with me, all the better.
If not, I'll go by myself.
Check that door.
Cathy...
It's Mother's.
This is Mother's room.
Come on. We can't stay here.
Look, there's an explanation for all this, Cathy.
As soon as we find mom, we'll ask. And she'll tell us.
Come on. We've gotta keep looking.
Let's go that way.
It's him.
He's dead, Christopher.
- What if he sees us?
- How can he see us if he's dead?
I always thought you were the best, Corrine.
Here!
- Do you love her as much as you used to?
- Don't ask stupid questions.
Wherever she is tonight, she's thinkin' of us... and she'll be comin' back. And when she does this will all make sense.
- The twins are sick, Christopher.
- They'll be all right.
- Chris!
- No! I don't want to talk about it anymore.
That crazy, sick old man is not gonna live forever, Cathy.
You could see that tonight.
He didn't even know who we were. Who you were.
Did you forget why we came here in the first place?
All the money in the world isn't worth the living that we've lost.
Well, maybe not for you, but without some of it, mom doesn't have a thing.
She has us if she cares!
Let's just take the twins and run away, Christopher.
We'll find a way out, but let's do it now before it's too late.
And then what do we do? What do I do for the four of us to keep us alive?
Don't you even doubt her in the least?
Can't you see how different she's become?
Can't you see what wanting all that money is doing to her?
I can't stop seeing that bed.
It's Mother, Cathy.
What do you want me to say?
Just the truth, that's all.
- Cory?
- I have to throw up, Cathy.
Why are you taking the flowers away, Carrie?
'Cause it's time.
- For what?
- Winter.
- Do you have a headache, Cory?
- I had one yesterday.
- Sore throat?
- A little.
Any numbness in your fingers or your toes?
What's numbness?
Like when your foot falls asleep and you can't feel it.
Sometimes.
Let me see your hand.
What are you doing?
Just looking.
Darlings! I'm back!
Darlings! I'm so happy.
Cathy, your hair!
What a sensible decision.
It's lovely, sweetheart.
You're angry with me. But you don't know how much I've missed you.
And wait till you see the presents I've bought you.
I wanted to tell you I was going away, but... but guess, guess what's happened.
- The Grandfather's dead.
- No.
He's been taken to the hospital?
No, I'm not happy because he's dying,
I'm happy because he loves me.
Don't you see?
I've done what I promised.
I've pleased him so much he's giving me a party tonight.
A grand party to reintroduce me to society.
And tomorrow my Father is having his attorney, Bart Winslow, a wonderful man, write me back into his will.
He's going to leave me everything.
Even this house.
And what about your children, Mother?
Does he know about them?
We know perfectly well what he feels about that.
So what's to become of us, mom?
How much longer do we continue living in this prison?
- Prison?
- You come back with gifts for us, mom.
Do you think they can make up for what we've lost?
Christopher...
- If you stop loving me...
- I haven't stopped loving you, mom.
I make myself keep loving you every day despite what you do.
- Don't say another word.
- Look at us, Mother.
Do we look like you, with your rosy cheeks and your bright eyes?
Look at the twins, Mother. Cory has stomach cramps almost every day!
And Carrie has little sores growing on her skin!
Do you know, or even care, that the
Grandmother stopped feeding us
- for over a week?
- Stop it!
You have no right to talk to me like that!
Tell me I've had pleasure while my children have been in pain.
You are heartless.
When you are ready to treat me with love, I'll be back.
What are you doing?
I'm going downstairs.
I wanna see that party.
You going with me?
Why aren't you up and dressed?
What have I told you about being together in your night clothes?
Cory's sick. He's very sick.
He needs a doctor.
Why are you just standing there?
Cory needs to be taken to a hospital.
There's no other decision to make.
What's wrong with you, Mother?
Are you just gonna stand there... and think about yourself and your money while Cory lies there and dies?
Don't you care what happens to him?
Have you forgotten that you're his Mother?
Always it's you!
- Ooh!
- Cathy!
Damn you to hell mama, if you don't take Cory to a hospital right now!
Do you think you can go on doing whatever you want to us... and nobody will ever find out?
If Cory dies, mama, you'll pay for it.
One way or another,
I will find a way.
I promise you that.
Come in.
Take the child downstairs and bring the car around.
My daughter is taking him to the hospital.
Hello, John.
Don't worry, Fred. He'll be back.
Cory had pneumonia.
The doctors did all they could.
There won't be a funeral.
He's already been buried.
No!
Something's wrong with Fred,
Christopher. He won't wake up.
Arsenic poisoning.
In the sugar on the cookies.
In small quantities you can't taste it or smell it.
It doesn't leave much of a trace, Cathy.
If they did an autopsy they wouldn't have found it.
Unless they were looking for it.
What do we do?
Tonight I'll go downstairs by myself.
I'm gonna find us some money... or a couple of those diamond rings that Grandmother wears.
And then what?
Then we're gonna leave this place, Cathy.
One way or another we're getting out.
Whatever happens after that will be up to us.
But whatever happens we'll be free.
Do we really have to wait until tomorrow?
Yes.
- Don't know if I can.
- You must.
What difference would 12 hours make?
The difference between one ring and two.
Damn you!
Damn you!
- What happened?
- We're leaving tomorrow.
- You found a way out?
- Yeah.
- Where? A window?
- No, a door.
- The front door.
- What?
There's gonna be another party tomorrow.
I saw them preparing one of the rooms.
There's probably gonna be
100 guests, maybe more.
They can't keep locking the door, not with that many people coming in.
What else happened tonight,
Christopher? What else did you see?
I mean, you told me that it's us against them. We're on our own.
Don't lie to me, Christopher.
It's not just a party, Cathy.
It's a wedding party.
Mom's getting married to that man tomorrow.
No, Chris!
- We're very excited to be here today.
- Congratulations.
I'm scared, Christopher.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Nobody's gonna hurt us anymore.
- This way.
- No, Chris.
They're not gonna get away with this.
We gotta go tell our Grandfather the truth.
What difference does it make now? Let's just go!
No! Mother's not getting that money, not after the way she treated us.
Now, come on.
He's gone.
He's dead, Cathy.
Yea, we can be with mama now.
No, Carrie. Mama lied to us.
She said she'd come and get us after her Father died, but... she never came.
She only cares about herself, Carrie.
She's going to spoil everything.
We can't wait any longer.
But your Mother... these are her friends.
It's my wedding.
We'll start the ceremony now!
Today's April 23.
Christopher, what is it?
A copy of the Grandfather's will.
It's two months old.
Says if it's ever proven that mom had children from her first marriage, even after he's dead, she'll be disinherited.
Mother's known all this time that we could never be found.
She never meant for us to leave that attic.
Dearly beloved, family and friends, we are gathered here on this most joyous of occasions... to join Corrine and Bart in holy matrimony.
Let us pray.
Heavenly Father, we read in
Genesis the creation story.
You said it was not good for man to be alone, so you created woman and thus gave your blessing to the union of holy matrimony.
Look now upon Bart and Corrine and pour out your grace upon them.
Give them the strength and peace to honor the vows they make before you today.
We pray that, in your loving kindness, you would bless their home by filling it with the sounds of happy, healthy children.
In the name of Christ, amen.
Mother!
Do you like my dress? I thought it was appropriate for the occasion.
Who are you? How did you get in here?
- Have you forgotten us already?
- Mama?
- Who are you children?
- We're the children of the bride.
Nonsense. You know I don't have any children.
Get them out of here.
I'll not have my wedding day ruined by a cruel, evil prank.
You're the one who's cruel and evil, Mother.
You kept us locked up in that attic and you said you'd come for us... after your Father died.
You never came!
You couldn't let anybody find out about us 'cause if you did you'd be disinherited.
It's not true. No!
What proof do they have?
It died from eating the same cookies Cory ate.
- Who's Cory?
- He was your son and my little brother.
- And you killed him.
- Just like you tried to kill us.
Look at us, Mother!
How could you do this to us?
Here, Mother.
Our wedding present to you.
- Stop it.
- Go on, eat it!
Eat the cookie!
We finally got our real revenge.
We managed to make it on our own.
I got a job to help put Chris through medical school.
Little Carrie grew up but she was never truly healthy.
I even started dancing again.
We left the past behind, all except the memories...
of Mother, Grandmother and the attic.
I sometimes wonder if
Grandmother is still alive.
Still presiding over Foxworth Hall.
Still awaiting my return.
[Siren]
Why can't people get themselves murdered on the ground floor?
Lieutenant.
Hey, Chaney.
Putting on some weight?
Where's the main event?
Down there.
Oh, Jesus.
Who was he?
Student. A few lived here.
One of them called?
No. Neighbor, floor below.
Heard some yelling.
Did he see anything?
No. Nothing.
It's hot as hell.
What were they yelling about?
Don't know.
All in some weirdo language.
Could this neighbor tell how many there were?
He wasn't sure.
Two, three...
One woman.
Surprise, surprise.
"but the lipstick-stained cigarette in the ashtray
"said this was no dream.
"so there was just one problem--
"if only he could... remember what she looked like"?
You don't like it.
I didn't--
I know. it's not that good.
I reread this last night.
This has an edge
That your new stuff doesn't have.
I won't lie to you, Phil.
The publishers are getting antsy.
You need a best-seller soon.
It's a dry spell.
Of course.
These things happen to writers.
It's been two years.
Four.
Four.
Christ.
Christ. Yeah,
I'm researching all the time.
I can't come up with any new crimes.
Get married again.
You'll think of new crimes.
The last thing
I need is another woman.
You haven't been with a woman since Susan.
That's not true.
I have.
Forget Susan.
She left you.
Thanks for reminding me, Sam.
That's ok.
It must have been so humiliating-- leaving you for a literary critic.
Why would you think that?
That's what you need.
What I need is a story.
Sleep with her and take notes.
Uh, miss?
Go for it.
Go on.
Hi.
My name's Phil.
I wrote this.
Mine's Karen, and, uh...I wrote this.
188-104-39a,
The state of New York vs. Richard Ryan.
My client has never dealt drugs.
He claims the only drug he's used is aspirin, and frankly,
I believe him.
Ok, ok. we accept possession,
But let's forget assault.
He's not capable of assault.
I understood from the prosecution that he attacked a uniformed officer and that this was seen by four witnesses.
Hey. Oliver, fx, Millie.
Hiya, Phil.
Phil, how's it going?
Good to see you, man.
You look tired.
Have some liverwurst.
Thanks.
I'm not hungry.
So how did it go?
Just like Rose said-- felony possession.
He dropped the assault charge.
You owe me 5 bucks.
Thanks.
See you soon.
How's the new book?
It didn't work out.
I need a new story. what's happening here?
Drug case down the hall, kidnapping-- second floor, a big malpractice upstairs.
189-403-26a...
Stick to murders. they're the cream.
Tony BernardinI's preliminary.
How does defense plead?
Not guilty.
Not guilty.
We're asking for a reasonable bail.
No chance.
Bail is...
[Gavel bangs]
That face--
He's an obvious killer.
Remember, a man's innocent until he's proven guilty.
Is he innocent,
Rose?
Guilty.
Who is that?
Must be the girl
Mason mentioned.
They say she killed a guy.
326-579-0a,
The state of New York vs. Nina Ionescu.
Her?
How could she kill anybody?
Stabbed him through the heart with a pair of 9-inch scissors. she'll go to prison.
The major drawback in killing someone.
Your honor, my client doesn't speak much english.
Guilty or not guilty?
I'm requesting a 24-hour continuance to talk with my client through a Romanian interpreter.
Granted.
Chapter one.
The tough heart of private eye
Peter Swift turned to molten lava when he saw her in that courtroom.
She had the face of an angel, fragile, ethereal.
He wondered what her breasts looked like.
She has a valid student visa.
That's about all we know.
We want to help you.
You don't understand a word I'm saying.
Would you like to confess?
In lieu of that, would you like to have my children?
Careful, Craig.
The dead guy was probably her lover.
What a way to go.
Craig, it's the embassy guys.
Hello, I'm craig farrell, assistant D.A.
Eugene Mason, public defender's office.
Frank Polito, homicide.
Troppa, Comanescu,
Avram.
I'm told you won't release her
To Romanian government.
Sorry, comrade. no can do.
But the victim was Romanian citizen.
He made the mistake of getting killed here.
The D.A.'s trying the case.
I will talk to her?
Be my guest.
Excuse me.
What's she saying?
She's begging for our assistance.
What the hell was that all about?
Maybe that's how they say goodbye in Romanian.
Congratulations, Jack.
Wonderful book.
Wonderful.
To Margaret, please.
What have you been doing, Philip?
I've been working, Jack.
Glad to hear that.
I thought you'd forsaken writing altogether.
I miss that character of yours,
That Peter...Swine?
Swift.
Of course.
He's so populist.
Jack, darling,
I couldn't put it down.
The best.
Just brilliant work.
You must sign this book.
Jack, it is superb.
Riveting, riveting.
Jack's a damned fine writer.
He's a pretentious ass.
He plagiarizes every word.
His stuff's so predictable.
I can write him off the page with my eyes closed.
So why don't you?
Maybe I will.
Meaning?
I think
I've found a story.
It could be good.
So what's the problem?
My inspiration's kind of locked up.
You think Balzac waited for inspiration?
You think Harold Robbins waits for inspiration?
Phil.
One of the most eligible bachelors in town.
You're looking so svelte.
How do you do it?
Liposuction.
Oh, you're so witty.
Swift had penetrated enemy headquarters.
His mastery of disguise was legendary.
[Metal detector beeps]
Was this a trick?
Were they actually aware of his brazen plan?
Swift suspected these thugs were leading him into a trap.
How you doing,
Raynette?
Ok.
The nubile scandinavian guard hurled the door open.
He was brutally flung inside.
This is it, father.
Thanks, dear-- uh...my child.
Um...
[Speaking romanian]
The word for "confession," father, is spovedania.
Spovedania.
Thank you.
[Speaking romanian]
What did I say?
You just said your mother's an octopus.
You do speak english.
You know, father, I'm from a communist country.
We have no religion.
I have nothing to confess.
No one's without sin.
There must be something.
Yes, uh...
Uh, I had, uh... impure thoughts.
Really?
I mean, uh...
Were they, uh, thoughts of anyone in particular or just random lust?
Just, uh...random?
Yes, my child.
And, uh, I de... de...tee... deceased?
Destroy.
Decapitated? des--despaired.
That's it? nothing else you want to tell me?
Take your time.
You didn't cheat at cards, steal anything?
No insider trading?
Murder anybody?
I have nothing more to confess.
Well, I can't tell you how happy that makes me.
Uh... what about my penance?
What?
Penance?
You're forgiven.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
Look... it's my turn to confess.
I'm not a priest.
Me, neither.
You work for the police.
No, I don't.
Who, then
Not for anybody.
I, uh, don't understand.
I was in court when you were arraigned.
I'd like to help you.
How
I can give you an alibi.
They will never believe it.
Well, maybe they will.
And if they don't?
What have you got to lose?
So...
What do you want...
Sex?
No.
No, no. God, no.
No. Nothing like that.
So, why are you doing this?
Because, I...
I don't know...
But I'm your only hope.
So, what is this alibi?
We're having an affair.
Since when?
Since last week she's been with me.
Sam knows about her.
Is that right?
That's right.
Where was this affair?
In my place in Connecticut.
How'd you meet her?
I already told you.
At a lecture
I was giving.
Bullshit.
Actually, it was a brilliant analysis of the american detective novel from Poe to Chandler.
Not the lecture, the meeting.
There was no meeting, not then.
I met Nina after the lecture.
Yes, he did.
I was there.
Billiant analysis of the american--
Did I already tell you this?
Lsten to this crap.
Excuse us a minute, please.
We have to take this one seriously.
We're running about five years behind in murder cases anyway.
You're buying his bullshit?
He's lying.
Why would he?
Are you blind?
Did you look at her?
Evidence against her isn't conclusive.
Nobody saw her do anything.
Just because she's a looker-- this political stuff's a pain in the ass.
We got two solid citizens with an alibi.
Why would they make it up?
Do you think they'll put me in one of those prisons for executives?
[workman whistles]
For you.
Thank you.
Where are you going?
You have to come with me.
No.
No?
We agreed.
This alibi has to be supported.
I could go to jail for this.
You're right, you're right. Let's go.
Ok.
Do you have many friends here?
No.
What do you do in your spare time?
Nothing.
Sounds like fun.
[Telephone rings]
Hello?
She with you?
Yes, and, uh,
I'm very happy about it.
Thank god.
Never thought this would work.
Uh, Phil, now do me a favor, hmm?
Get back to the typewriter.
Right.
How's blackwood? got him working?
As we speak, Hank.
I hope so. You've backed him a long time.
There's a buzz around--
If he bombs out, you do, too.
[Door closes]
Talk to you later.
All right.
Bye-bye.
Yeah. Bye.
You don't have phones in your cars in Romania?
We don't have phones in our houses.
What do you do?
I write books.
Oh, what kind of books?
Oh, mystery novels, thrillers.
Oh.
You're not impressed.
No. I read only serious books.
Hmm.
Well...
Here we are.
You did not tell me you live in a hotel.
I don't. it's my house.
So, how many people live here?
I live alone.
There you are.
Ah, you must be very rich.
Oh, not really.
I do ok.
Here we are.
So, the bathroom's down the hall.
Closet, extra towel, bed.
No telephone in there?
My room's right down the hall.
In case you need anything...
Like extra hangers, blankets...
Unbridled passion.
Despite the dozens of ravishing creatures begging to be part of his life,
Swift had lived alone since his wife... was incinerated several years before when the microwave went berserk during a thunderstorm.
But now a stranger was living with him, an exotic, sensual creature whose obvious passion for Swift was barely contained beneath a cool facade.
Ahem.
What is this?
What?
This.
I call it soup.
Oh, soap.
Soup.
Can I, uh, ask you a question?
Um, it is not personal, I hope.
No.
No.
So, what's the population of Romania?
Um...
Are you married?
And Romania's
91,700 square miles.
As the japanese servants unobtrusively cleared away the remnants of Swift's gourmet meal, he and the girl exchanged sparkling repartee.
His turn of phrase clearly had her entranced.
Yet, perceptive as always,
Swift knew she needed him, that without him, she'd be as helpless as a lost child.
Jesus.
Um, I do not like bugs.
Well, neither do I, but I usually scream at them and hit them with a copy of sports illustrated.
How did you do that?
Um, I don't know. it was just, uh... instinct?
Yeah. Instinct.
Uh, I'm tired now.
I'm going to go to bed.
But... good night.
[Doorbell rings]
Good night.
[Ring]
Lieutenant.
Mr. Blackwood.
Hey, that's not a bad idea.
You may need that for more than just bugs.
What do you want?
I was nearby.
I thought I'd check in.
That's thoughtful of you, but as you can see, everything is fine.
Ah, this is nice, very classy.
It's my kind of house.
Thanks.
Something occurred to me today.
Did it?
What if she's guilty?
She's innocent.
For the sake of arguing, let's say you're lying and you didn't have an affair or even meet her until after the crime.
Consider the position you're in.
I'm a perjurer.
Not just that.
What?
You're the mystery writer.
I thought you'd figure that out.
While you're alive, there's a chance you'd rescind your phony alibi, sending her to jail, and she knows that.
If you die before rescinding it, it would stand forever.
Her freedom would be practically guaranteed by your death.
It doesn't matter.
She's innocent.
Yeah, well, I just thought I'd tell you that.
Glad you shared that.
Did you want to tell me anything else?
Nope.
You mind if I borrow this?
Be my guest.
I'm going to bed.
Alone?
Yes, alone.
Weren't you having an affair?
Oh, I have a headache.
Well, I hope you have a good lock on your bedroom door.
Safe dreams, pal.
The cop turned and left, but his insinuations hung in the air like a bad smell.
It was absurd,
But could he be right?
What if she was a killer and he was the only thing standing in the way of her freedom?
He tried to relieve the tension with a strenuous workout, but even the 200 extra one-arm push-ups did nothing to calm him.
"Do any of us,"
Swift wondered,
"really know the person we fall in love with?"
[Floor creaks]
[Knock at door]
Philip?
Shit.
I'm coming.
Just a second.
Just a second.
I'm coming.
I'm coming. just a second.
[Ripping]
I'm coming.
Hi.
Uh, I was just exercising.
Hmm. It looks more like you were moving furniture.
That's how I exercise.
Some people ride bicycles.
Some people jog.
I move furniture.
You're a very odd man.
I take it that's a compliment.
No, but I wanted to thank you for everything that you have done for me.
Oh.
That's ok.
Anytime you're locked up, just... thank you.
Did you sleep well?
Sure. Why not?
You?
Mmm. Ok.
You're reading one of my books.
I thought you were strictly Proust and Dostoevsky.
Oh, I couldn't go to sleep last night.
I knew this would help.
Murder becomes her-- it's my personal favorite.
What'd you think?
Oh, it was, um, how you say... pre-- profound?
No, no, no, no.
It was per-- was not per-- it's per... perceptive?
Perfect.
Wait, um, um... perdictable.
Yeah. Perdictable. Yeah.
You mean, predictable?
Yeah.
I'm going to town.
Um...
I will go with you.
Yeah?
Predictable?
Son of a bitch.
Uh, could you push that button again?
Shit.
Aah!
Oh, I'm--I'm sorry.
Uh, just shut the engine off.
Nuh.
60% chance of rain--
* bop bop ba loo mop *
The key!
Turn the key!
* and she knows just what to do *
* I said a girl named Sue *
[Horn honks]
* she knows just what to do *
* she run to the east... **
I must have moved, uh...
Gearshift.
Yeah.
That's ok.
Accidents happen.
The destruction of Pompeii, the Titanic.
It is your fault anyway.
Why is it my fault?
Because you get all panic,
And you make me nervous.
Avram.
How about this one?
They don't make them any sharper.
Surgical steel.
Go ahead.
Feel that edge.
Hmm?
Yeah. It is good.
A knife?
Why would she tell him nothing?
Swift had to find the truth for himself.
That night, he crept with leopard-like stealth to where he could observe her... unnoticed.
What strange, exotic ritual was he watching?
He tightened his grip on the pistol in his hand.
Aah!
From the bedroom of the otherwise innocent-looking bungalow, she stared coldly into the darkness like a primeval predator surveying her prey.
And slowly, irreversibly...
"she closed the shutters."
She did that?
Of course not.
It's fiction.
I never liked this situation between you and her.
It's very dicey.
You want me to quit?
No, of course not.
So you like it.
Very promising.
Of course,
This priest stuff is totally unbelievable, only a cretin would do something that stupid, but very inventive.
Damn stuff.
So, what happens next?
I'm not sure.
I thought you planned out your stories before you started writing.
Usually, but this one's different.
I'm going day to day on this one.
I'm sorry. Well, if it's any consolation, this is your best work in years.
I know.
Are they going to have an affair?
I don't know.
I hope so.
Where is she now?
I don't know. out somewhere.
Buying more weapons,
I suppose.
Attention,
K-Mart shoppers, for the next 15 minutes, there will be a blue-light special on light bulbs.
Brighten your day with K-Mart quality.
[Speaking romanian]
Bye, Nina.
Where are you going?
My barber's.
But your friend's still here.
No, he's gone.
I can cut your hair.
I used to cut my family's hair.
I'll just skip it.
I don't need a haircut.
Long hair's making a comeback.
No, it is not.
Don't be silly.
Now, uh...
Now...
Where are the scissors?
Scissors?
You know what they are.
Scissors?
There's no scissors.
There were, but I loaned them to my brother.
Ah, here they are.
Yeah.
They are sharp enough, you think?
They look very dull to me.
Besides, my hair is very coarse.
Come on. Sit down.
Keep still, or I'll cut you.
Just a trim, nothing radical.
Perfect!
God, you're wonderful at this.
You've cut hair professionally.
Go on, admit it.
I didn't cut anything.
It's not how much you cut,
It's what you cut.
Minimalism. It's...
Just sit down.
You're so nervous.
No, I'm relaxed.
I just--I look nervous when I'm relaxed.
You make fun.
You hide your feelings in, how do you say-- sarcasm.
Yeah.
Why do you do that?
Now, move toward me.
Closer, closer, closer.
Yeah, that's good.
It's great.
Hmm. Very good.
Yes. I'm finished.
Good?
Perfect.
How was it for you?
[Distant thunder]
Hello.
Hi.
Hi.
This is beautiful.
Yes.
Philip... why did your wife leave you?
She said she had to grow.
To grow?
I assumed that she was fully grown when I married her.
It was, uh, painful for you, her leaving.
Yes.
Actually, I'm not being completely fair about her.
She thought she had a reason for leaving.
What?
She said she left me because I wrote.
But you are a writer.
Yeah.
Well, that's just it.
It was all very nice at first.
It was very romantic, very mysterious, my being a writer, but she said I never really did anything, that I wrote about life, but I never lived it.
This would make your wife happy.
What would?
Me.
You?
Yeah.
This-- what you have done, this alibi you've given me.
It is something very different from your books.
Yeah,
I guess it is.
I do not fit in your world. not entirely, no.
But you are doing something, yes?
Yeah, I guess I am.
It's going to rain.
So? We will dry.
Doesn't it rain in your books?
I guess it does.
Oops.
[singing in romanian]
[Humming]
[singing in romanian]
* bum bum bum bum bum **
They let their towels drop to the floor.
His eyes explored every inch of her glistening, wet body.
Her eyes explored every inch of his... muscled torso.
He took her in his arms.
Her breasts squashed against him.
They kissed.
She nearly passed out from the rapture, but Swift, familiar with this reaction, gathered her into his arms and carried her into his bedroom.
Careful.
It's not as easy as it looks.
You got to allow for wind, arrow weight, trajectory...
And don't shoot that dog.
[Woof woof]
I think you've grasped the principle.
[Telephone rings]
[Ring]
Doggie.
[Ring]
Hello?
Hey, Blackwood.
Lieutenant Polito.
You're still alive.
Yes, thanks.
Listen, I read your book.
I've got to tell you something.
Your work is a little predictable.
Predictable?
Yeah. You should spend some time with me.
Get some grit into it.
I'll think about that, lieutenant.
How's the girl?
Get rid of those headaches?
You know what your problem is?
What?
I think you're jealous.
Is that right?
Yes.
You want to know why?
I'll bet you've never had a decent relationship.
Am I right?
Sure, sure.
You are suspicious of everything and everyone.
Let me tell you something, the right woman will change all that.
She'll make you want to sing.
Ever feel like that?
No. What's it feel like?
Aah! aah!
Ok. All right.
I didn't ask for a recital.
Aah! Aah!
Listen to me,
Blackwood.
I'd haul you in for perjury if I could.
Your ass would be grass. understand?
Blackwood?
Are you there?
You--aah!
You have to work at a relationship.
What are you talking about?
It's very easy to get hurt.
All right, I know.
I've been there myself.
Maybe I am a little jealous of you.
I mean, she's a beautiful woman, you know?
Aah! Exactly.
So tell me, um... what's she like?
Aah!
That good, huh?
Oh, my god.
What have you done now?
This is no time to make a call.
Lieutenant--aah!
Get down! Get down!
Am I interrupting something here?
Yes. Don't pull it!
Aah! Aah!
It's coming!
It's coming!
Aah! That's enough.
Leave it alone.
Aah!
Don't touch the shaft! Aah!
You're pulling too hard.
She's an animal.
She's an animal.
She's tearing him apart.
You'll never get it out.
We'll need help.
Aah!
The lucky putz.
I'd better call an ambulance.
I can get you there faster.
Watch the tip.
Aah!
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Reverse.
You need reverse.
Open the door!
I thought you said you drove in Romania.
This is how we drive in Romania.
Oh, no. Lucy!
There goes my safe driver discount.
[Honk]
What does this word
"yield" mean?
Brake. Brake!
It was the dog.
It jumped up at me.
It was an accident.
Don't blame yourself.
What will you tell the doctor?
That I shot myself.
With a bow and arrow?
Aah! I didn't know it was loaded.
Wait!
That was the hospital you just passed.
No!
It's ok.
No! Aah!
Aah!
We are here.
The cold, steel shaft of the arrow pierced his... sinewed shoulder. the pain would have been unbearable for the average man, but Swift pulled it cleanly from the wound.
His amazing instincts told him something was wrong with her story about the dog.
As he lifted 400-pound weights, he was in agony, but he bore it in silence.
Aah!
[Thunder]
Aah!
You think she's really trying to kill you?
No. Yes. Maybe.
Of course not.
I don't know. why do you ask?
Excuse me.
Because if she kills you, I'm next.
She's not going to kill me.
Oh?
Just using you as target practice?
That was an accident.
There's no such things as accidents.
Only plans other people don't tell you about.
I hope she's a tornado between the sheets.
I haven't slept with her yet.
You haven't slept with her?
Sorry.
Then what's the point of this?
I love her.
Oh, right.
Why do I keep forgetting that?
Doesn't anybody recognize love anymore?
The tensions.
The pain.
Uncertainty.
The cold sweats.
The nauseous feelings that swell in the pit of your stomach.
Where has romance gone today?
I'm sorry.
I don't buy this whole thing.
You're jeopardizing a best-seller.
I think you should end it.
Sam, you don't understand.
Even if I wanted to,
I couldn't.
I need her for this story.
We're writing it together.
I don't know what comes next.
Lie. That's what writers do.
That won't ring true.
Ever since she moved in, the story just-- it flows.
Sometimes she seems like a lost child. other times I think she's hiding something.
I love her, and I'm terrified of her.
Sounds like a normal relationship.
What drives our characters, what drives us all, is lust.
Lust. We're slaves to its power.
We let it run our lives.
Well, don't kid yourselves.
We're all its willing victims.
Its raw, molten lasciviousness motivates all of us.
Uh...
Uh, ahem, are there any questions?
People say that you've based the tough but suave and debonair character
Peter Swift on yourself.
Is that true?
Well, it...
Yes, that's true.
I'm sorry.
His lecture on laser weapons to the assembled anti-terrorism experts was, as expected, a great success.
But the girl?
Why was she there?
Was she KGB?
CIA
There was no denying her physical attributes.
Physical attributes.
But Swift brushed these thoughts aside as he went about his daily routine of righting wrongs.
And yet... even now... was he being furtively followed?
Finished.
Yeah?
This, um... how do you say, gen
Genre?
Yeah. Well... has possibilities.
I'll look forward to that.
Good.
Your, uh, detective, uh, Peter Swift, he never makes love to the women that he helps?
He's gay?
No.
It's a code he lives by.
Oh. Why?
Because that's the way it is.
Or because that's the way you want it.
It's the same thing.
What I want is how it is.
Are you angry at me?
Philip, what is it?
Who are you?
What do you mean?
That's an easy enough question. Who are you?
I wish
I could tell you.
Then do it.
No.
And why not?
Be--it-- it's for your own good.
Thank you.
That makes me feel a whole hell of a lot better.
I will go.
I don't want you to go.
I just want you to answer a question of mine, one question of mine.
I want to know.
What do you want to know?
Did you kill that man?
Her weapon's glare reflected in his eye, but he had faced death before.
He waited for her to make the first move.
[Door closes]
Swift coolly stood his ground,
All but daring her to come and get him.
Aah!
Ahem. Uh, you were exercising?
What are you doing here?
For you.
Nina...
My tender femininity aches to feel the thrusting of your firm maleness.
I'm sorry?
Can you not feel the twin points of my two love globes crushed against your chest?
What?
My moist loins hunger to have you firmly inside me.
What are you saying?
Words of love.
Oh. Whose words of love?
Yours, from your magazine stories.
What magazine?
Playboy?
You read that?
Is that not what you americans say when you...
Ha ha.
What is so funny?
You were laughing at me.
I wasn't.
Nina, I wasn't laughing at you.
Oh, hell.
You don't have to memorize anything.
It'll come out of you naturally in any language.
[Speaking romanian]
What's that mean?
My moist loins hunger to...
Swift poured himself a bourbon and watched from the patio as she dived into the azure mediterranean.
The tension was finally broken. fear had been replaced by passion.
But more than that, he was assured this was no murderess.
This was the best sex he ever had.
He never felt happier or safer.
Lieutenant, fire chief says could have been a gas main or a bomb.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, my god.
Is he all right?
He's stable.
Just shocked.
I'm fine.
Most accidents happen near the house.
So do most murders.
It was an accident.
Really?
And where were you when it happened?
I was, uh, just inside the door.
And her?
She was in the pool.
How convenient.
Don't say another word.
You're very kind.
Yes, but that's not the point.
We're delighted you're staying with us.
Come and have some, dear.
You're very underweight.
Tony, get away from that old barn!
Phil, what are you making, meteorites?
Oh, uh, sorry.
I hope you like your burgers well-done.
You know, Phil,
Nina's a marvelous girl.
She's so unusual.
That accent, is that for real?
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
We know you're an independent guy and you pride yourself on being like your detective character, but something's bothering you.
We're worried about you.
We're your family. we care.
We want you to open up to us.
Break that facade and let what you're feeling out.
Talk to us, Phil.
Why keep secrets from your brother?
I'm an emotional nomad.
When Susan left me, it killed me.
I asked myself-- am I looking for something too perfect?
Then along comes Nina.
She makes me feel like no one has in a long time-- salad needs more salt.
It has salt.
I think it needs dill.
In one way,
I love her, but then again,
I loved Susan, and one day this stranger left me.
Try paprika.
Parsley.
Still I had doubts, but who doesn't doubt the person they love?
There's always a part of someone you never know.
Parsley makes erections last longer.
How is it?
I'll let you know tonight.
Oh, I'm sorry, Phil.
You were saying there's someone in your house you didn't know
Mom, Dad, Tony's stuck on the roof!
Oh, my god.
Oh, for Christ's sakes.
Tony, stay still!
Don't move!
Get a ladder.
I lent it to the sinclairs.
Honey, just stay calm.
Daddy's going to get you down.
I am calm.
I'll get him.
Don't you dare move.
That rope's too short.
We need something. here's a barrel.
How did he get up there?
He used the hole in the barn and climbed-- all right. shut up!
Tony, stay still.
Grab this, Phil.
What is all the fuss about?
If he falls, he falls.
Don't look down.
Will you two hurry?
Coming, tony!
Hold on, son.
I got it.
There you go.
Oh, no!
Aah!
Clowns.
Phil, are you all right?
Sorry, buddy.
That was great, Gary.
Let's do it again.
Here comes wonder woman.
What?
I could do that.
Swift realized the child's only chance lay in his hands.
Unconcerned for his own safety,
Swift scaled the towering wall of the embassy.
Bracing himself against the powerful alpine winds, he calmly walked the crest of the roof, at least 300 feet above the courtyard.
Oh!
Watch out!
The tile broke in his grasp, and the startled screams of the women watching rose like prayers from below.
All right.
Now we're going to get you down.
You put this leg over on this side.
Good.
Finally, Swift reached the terrified child and swung him through the bay window of the embassy into his mother's outstretched and eternally grateful arms.
Smart ass.
What did you say she did back in Romania?
Receptionist? my friend in immigration learned something about the girl.
Her family was here in America last year.
Why?
Don't know. Her file was withdrawn.
Shit.
Well, I'm still working on it.
There's a D.A. owes me a favor.
Thanks, Rose.
Bye.
[Speaking romanian]
Atunci la inmorminatare.
Da. Inmorminatare.
Inmorminatare.
Inmorminatare Grimaldi.
Swift, an expert linguist, recognized the word from the time he spent behind the iron curtain.
It was the Romanian word for... funeral.
Greg is so busy.
Oh, you poor thing.
I'll bring it up to the board monday.
We agreed. no shop talk tonight.
So where's the bulgarian beauty
I've heard about?
Romanian.
What do you mean, you won't be at dinner?
It's a Romanian custom.
What is?
On St. Stanislaw day, the youngest woman in the house, usually a virgin, prepares a meal and then she leaves.
For how long?
Until after.
You must keep one empty seat for me.
That's a perfectly lovely custom.
I never heard of it.
What did
St. Stanislaw do?
He was martyred.
Naturally. By whom?
Um, by heretics.
You see, they lived in the forest of pain.
St. Stanislaw went to convert them, but they captured him, cut his tongue out, hung him naked by his testicles, and burned him alive.
Charming. Sort of a Romanian triathlon.
Ah, I think it is ready now.
Great. Can't wait to taste it.
Bad luck.
Where are you going during dinner?
For a walk.
All alone?
No. The woods will be full of romanian virgins swapping recipes.
Remember to toast to my health while I'm gone.
I love you.
See you later.
[Meow]
Beeswax, get away from there!
Sorry, Beeswax.
There you go.
You can have
Nina's share.
My compliments to the absent chef.
Absolutely.
To Nina.
Hear, hear.
To the chef. Ok.
Still nervous, Phil?
No, no.
Look at him.
He's a wreck.
You want my advice?
Marry her.
She's a little too young for him.
You never know who you're marrying, do you?
People change.
This isn't the woman
I married
15 years ago.
You're damn right.
That woman lives on Central
Park west.
You married me
12 years ago.
Whatever.
Laura. and this arrow comes right through the door and skewers me in the ass.
It's all comical now.
I was convinced she did it on purpose.
On purpose?
Here's the best part.
I thought she tried to blow up my house.
He thought she tried to blow up the house.
Am I an idiot?
You're an idiot.
You're an idiot.
How could I suspect her?
Who wants more casserole?
Oh!
I do.
Thank you.
More. More.
I'll get it.
Honey, you shouldn't.
It won't kill me.
Greg, did Gary tell you what Nina did yesterday?
What's the matter,
Beeswax, too much casserole?
Beeswax?
Beeswax?
Beeswax, come on.
I think they're an adorable couple.
She has a surface beauty, but that's no basis for a long-term relationship.
What is?
Love.
Right.
She poisoned us!
No, really.
I'm serious!
The casserole.
The cat.
The cat!
Oh, my god, it's true!
How could you fall in love with a murderer?
It's not easy to meet girls.
My beautiful Beeswax.
There's got to be an antidote.
Nice going, Phil.
Don't worry.
Give me that cheesecake!
What about your diet?
Screw my diet.
St. Stanislaw.
I knew she made it up.
Here, try the antidote for liquid drain opener.
No. You try it.
Let's get this stuff analyzed.
I'd rather die.
We better throw up.
Throw up, come on!
Let's go to the balcony.
Hurry!
That's not good enough.
They'll pump our stomachs in the hospital.
Do you know the way there?
Believe me,
I know it.
Sam, we never said goodbye to the children.
Careful, don't spill it.
Calm down, everyone's going to be fine.
Sweethearts, it's your mother.
I don't want to upset you, but you may never see us again.
I have a confession.
I've been lying about my age for years.
We know.
Why didn't she just murder you?
Say something she'll remember.
Thanks, Gary.
I've never been much of a father, Daphne,
I know, but there's one bit of advice that I regard as invaluable.
Dad, my boyfriend's on the other line.
I should get my own parking space here.
Come on, hurry.
I'm suing you,
Blackwood.
I always knew she was trouble.
Relax, stomach pumping doesn't hurt.
Philip?
Um, Consuela, where is everybody?
[Speaking spanish]
He walked to her and took her in his arms, her breasts pressed firmly against him.
That was the worst experience of my life.
I've never had anything that big stuck down my throat before.
That's not what I've heard.
The tough heart of Peter Swift turned to molten lava when he saw her.
She had an angel's face. fragile.
Her breath was tantalizing. Arousing, but as she cut his hair,
Swift felt the cold scissors brush his neck.
Swift had lived alone since his wife was incinerated when the microwave went berserk.
Now a stranger lived with him.
An exotic, sensual creature.
What if the cop was right?
What if she was a murderer?
Do any of us know the person we fall in love with?
Was this woman his lover or murderer?
You'll never work again, Blackwood.
Gary, I want to explain something.
Not now, Henry. we had a rough night.
You know how your cat is always coming over?
Well, Donna found it in our basement, dead.
It must have been around the fuse box and gotten electrocuted.
Donna wanted to tell you before, but she didn't want to walk into your party carrying a dead cat, so she put it inside your back door.
Look, I'm sorry.
We'll get you another cat.
Nina.
You think
I'm a murderer.
I don't think that.
It's in your book!
I'm willing to see the other side.
Did you give me this alibi to get ideas for your book?
I did it because I knew you were innocent and I love you.
No. You're afraid of me.
Well, fear is part of any healthy relationship.
I'm going.
Where?
Oh, wait!
Don't say it-- you can't tell me.
I cannot.
Naturally.
You can't go!
I'm not a character in your book.
You cannot make me stay.
You didn't invent me.
You don't write my words.
I do as I choose.
Now I choose to go.
Goodbye.
[Engine starts]
[Car drives away]
Her family is still here.
In America?
They disappeared last month.
It's my friend's guess that they want to defect and the romanians want to stop them.
Why doesn't our state department help?
They don't like to get involved.
It's a touchy area.
What are her parents, diplomats?
No. Ready for this?
They're circus performers.
They're acrobats.
Famous.
National treasures in Romania.
If the government loses them,
It's bad P.R. for the comrades.
Why wouldn't Nina tell me that?
In her country, you grow up not trusting anyone.
Half the country informs on the other half.
That phrase you wrote-- uh... im-- uh, in-- inmormin--
It means funeral.
That's right. the funeral of Grimaldi.
But what or who is Grimaldi?
A famous clown.
Every year clowns get together on the day he died.
That's where she'll meet her parents.
American clowns have been hiding them since they decided to defect.
Let's tell the cops.
They'll nail us for perjury.
I'm going to prison.
I'll become a sex slave to some drug kingpin.
You won't become anybody's sex slave.
What will we do?
We'll help her ourselves.
What do you mean, ourselves?
Phil, this isn't the Bolshoi ballet, you know.
These people are KGB!
Look, I told you,
If I don't go through with this,
I don't have an ending for the book.
Well, steal it!
Plagiarize.
Get in.
Phil, stop and think about this.
Everybody's saying my work is detached, that I live in an ivory tower.
I'm coming down from that tower right now.
I'm going, with or without you.
What do you say?
Frankly, what I like most about your books is they're predictable.
That's a very comforting quality. readers love it.
Swift, now attired in his customary tuxedo and accompanied by his african bodyguard, evaded the cloying paparazzi and slipped into the elegant ballroom, where he rubbed elbows with the cream of society.
Philip!
Nina.
I'm with my parents.
We are going to defect.
Nina, I'm sorry.
[Toot]
Oh.
That man.
What man?
That clown.
Come, quick.
[Speaking romanian]
Comanescu.
KGB.
[Speaking romanian]
Come on.
Mama, stop.
They'll be waiting at the main gate.
There must be another way out.
[Speaking romanian]
What are you all talking about?
Freeze, Bozo!
Amateur.
Look, he's one of them.
[speaking romanian]
Go!
Rapide, rapide!
Rapide!
You, too. Go on.
No, no.
If you stay, then I stay.
[speaking romanian]
[speaking romanian]
What did he say?
I must go with him.
Sorry, pal.
The lady's with me.
I go with him.
No! What's romanian for
"get lost, dickface"?
What dickface?
Swift knew he had a formidable opponent, but the detective's mastery of karate, judo, tae kwon do, and macrame, combined with his gutsy knack for street fighting, made him more than a match for his adversary.
That's a good one!
Swift played him like a cat
Toying with a doomed mouse.
It was only a matter of time.
[speaking romanian]
[speaking romanian]
You guys need an agent?
[speaking romanian]
Get your hands up!
Hands up!
His opponent had landed a few lucky punches.
Swift decided the time had come to stop fooling around. and 1...
3! You're out!
The winner!
I am diplomat, the romanian socialist republic.
Yes, sir. Thank you for the information.
Where are the others?
One over there.
Jesus.
You ok?
I'm fine.
Nina!
Nina!
Pretty realistic, huh?
That's more like it.
Where's the third one?
Right here.
Piece of cake.
[Speaking romanian]
Uh, hello.
[Speaking romanian]
How'd you know where I was?
The feds were working on this defection deal.
What's happening?
To us.
I heard it's all approved.
You still have some formalities at the state department.
I'll take you there.
You're in bad shape.
I never felt better in my life.
Get in the car.
I'll drive.
Listen, you think you can manage the rest without me, lieutenant?
I'll give it a try.
That night, Swift returned to his lavishly refurbished
Manhattan penthouse, where his personal code of never falling in love with a client or suspect finally came to be broken.
The doubts, the fears are gone at last, and yet there was one thing the detective had to know.
Nina.
Hmm?
There's something
I have to know.
The guy who was murdered...
Oh, yeah.
You know, the scissors.
Well, you see--
No. They--they caught my family,
Uh, when we were about to defect.
And this student, a romanian, he came over to help us, and, uh, they started to fight.
And my family, they managed to escape, but the... the man that you fighted with...
Mmm.
He killed a student.
Mmm.
I knew you couldn't have done anything like that.
I knew it from the first moment I saw you.
Aah!
Got it.
You're so nervous.
Why?
Bugs do that to me.
He held her in his arms and kissed her long and hard.
He understood this woman completely now.
Not a part of her existed that he didn't know, except, of course, what she didn't want him to know.

They're watching me.
May l have the key to the conference room? lt's all right.
This is the Vanderbilt Club.
The world's dangers stop at the front door.
The committee won't allow them in.
Call an ambulance.
This one's mine. Find your own.
Goddamn... l love you!
- Get out of my cab!
- Where is it?
Get out right now!
- l'd love to.
- Driver!
- Get out of my cab.
- This one is my cab. lt's my cab.
Tell me where to take it.
Where do you wanna go, honey?
To your place or mine? l don't care. Let's just go.
Just go straight up Park Avenue.
We'll tell you where when we finish negotiating.
- Any decision yet?
- Take me to the Roosevelt.
The Roosevelt? Your place.
Shameless hussy.
Okay, we'll go to there for a drink, then guess what? l'm gonna take you to the circus.
Afterwards, we'll have supper and champagne. How's that sound?
- Don't like the circus?
- No.
- Okay, so we'll skip the circus.
- l just can't.
Certainly. You think l'm a dummy? l can take a hint.
How does this sound?
Your place, late supper, your place.
All right, your place, quick shower, your place.
What is it? ls that cab following you?
Who's back there? Russian spies?
- A jealous lover?
- Driver, find me a mailbox.
A mailbox?
What's the matter?
Are you in trouble? l'll mail it for you.
Okay.
- Are you all right?
- l'm fine. l was acting dopey, but it's because l'm nervous.
Today is a great day. l got a contract. l don't know anyone.
Would you have one drink with me? l'll go right away. Would you do that?
You're very sweet, but not today.
How about tomorrow?
Wait a minute.
- Tell me your name.
- You don't give up.
- lt's important.
- Janet Dunn.
Michael Jordon.
- Hello.
- Hello, Janet.
Goodbye, Michael Jordon.
Oh, shit.
What have we got here, $4.70?
That's what it says. l got an extra circus ticket.
Elephant shit makes me sneeze.
My sister's kids would.
Sold.
- Bye, Mr. Jordon.
- Bye, Jimmy.
- Mr. Jordon?
- Yeah, hi.
- Don't do anything stupid, Mr. Jordon.
- Okay. Okay.
Let me guess. Mugging? ls this a mugging?
My second trip to New York l got a mugging.
Everything's yours.
No one gets hurt. l'm not the Michael Jordon you want. l'm an architect from Chicago. l haven't made any enemies here.
All right, all right. l can walk, you know.
Assume l am the right Michael you're looking for. l wanna know what the hell is going on here right now. l suppose it could wait till later.
We're not going to the circus?
Move.
What's your connection with Janet Dunn?
She's my brother.
Sit down, Mr. Jordon.
What's your connection with Janet Dunn? l don't know what you mean. l shared a taxicab with her.
You know that. You followed us.
- You mailed a package for her.
- l did. l mailed a package.
Listen, l don't know who Janet Dunn is. l don't know who you are. l just wanna get out of here.
- Can't we work it out?
- Who did she send it to?
- l don't know.
- Didn't you see the address? l looked at the package for a second.
But l wasn't paying attention. l don't remember anything.
What? Oh. What are you doing?
Jesus! Oh, no!
Don't, please! Not needles!
Thank you, Mr. Jordon.
You've been a help.
Take care of him.
No, no, not that way.
Persuade him to commit suicide.
Off a bridge.
What about witnesses?
Don't worry about it.
He'll be a good boy. Won't you?
Where there's life, there's hope.
- Who's the creep?
- What's the problem?
One of these creeps is pumping my buns.
Yeah, which one?
Goodbye, creep.
Right here.
- Not a chance.
- Don't say that.
There hasn't been a caboose here... l was in the caboose that hasn't been here. l was in it!
- lt had electronic equipment.
- Someone must've copped it.
- Want me to put out an APB?
- You're making jokes!
They tried to kill me, and you're making jokes.
You've a woman you never saw before, three guys you don't know. lt happened in a caboose that don't exist.
No, l don't think it's a joke.
Go home and sleep it off.
May l help you, sir? l'm trying to find a friend,
Janet Dunn.
Just a minute.
We have no one by that name, sir.
Sorry.
Janet Dunn!
That's your name? How come the clerk didn't know it?
Because l didn't register under it.
- l wanted privacy.
- l'd like some privacy too.
Three of your friends tried to kill me. Tell me their names?
Stay away from me and you'll be all right. l'll stay away from you. Just tell me who tried to kill me tonight.
You won't tell me one thing?
All right, you don't know their names.
Will you do me one favor,
Janet, please. Stop!
Would you just tell me what l mailed?
- Why is that package important?
- lt's not.
They stuck a needle in me to get the address.
What did you say?
Everything l know, but who knows what that is.
They said thank you.
Wait a minute!
Janet, wait a minute. Let me talk to you for a minute. l know you're scared. l'm scared too.
- Maybe we could help each other.
- Get away.
Not until l have some answers.
Get the fuck away from me!
Operator, this is long distance to Terrance Martin.
The number... Yes, l'll wait.
But hurry, operator, please.
Let go!
Son of a bitch!
What happened? What happened?
Jesus...
Jesus!
- God!
- What have you done to her?
He shot her, Buck. He killed her!
What are you talking about? l didn't do it. This isn't mine.
Help me, call the po...
Mister, call... Lady...
Lady! God! Call the police!
Oh, God! Help me!
Hold it right there, boy.
Here, take it.
Tension coupled with anxiety.
Look out, he's got a gun!
Freeze, boy!
Hold it right there, boy!
Not me, you damn fools! Him!
He killed a woman upstairs!
His what hurts?
Come in, coffee's on. l gotta scan the neighborhood first.
I got my lucky saxophone?
We're two weeks from the greatest fight of your life...
...and en route to the championship.
Why take chances?
- ls that you, Mr. Jordon?
- Yeah, Jimmy.
- Good night, Mr. Jordon.
- Good night.
- Police.
- l wanna turn myself in.
- lt's Michael Jordon.
- Please hold.
I don't wanna die. I don't wanna die!
Father, I don't wanna die!
Help, please!
- Night Sergeant.
- Hello, do you deliver?
Pizza!
Not police, pizza! l'm sorry, l had the wrong number.
Here's a local news wrap-up.
Murder at a midtown hotel.
National security chief stricken at Vanderbilt Club.
And the Yanks blow it.
Now the top story.
A brutal murder at one of New York's best hotels.
A man apparently shot and killed...
...a young woman registered as Janet Stone.
The alleged murderer was photographed...
...by our cameras covering the Humanities Award.
The police have an eyewitness and are confident of an early arrest.
If you know the whereabouts of this man, contact the police.
This is everything l have.
Just don't hurt me.
Who are you?
- Just take the money.
- l don't want your money! l don't want your body either.
What are you doing in my apartment?
- This is Nathan Curry's.
- You're a friend?
- Yes, who are you?
- l'm Michael Jordon.
- He's got my apartment in Chicago.
- When did he leave? l don't know! l've been here a week.
The agency in Chicago didn't say anything about you. l'm Kate Hellman. l'm really sorry.
- l thought you were a burglar.
- l thought you were!
- l almost bashed your brains in!
- l'm sorry.
- You scared me!
- lt's a mess in here. lf my home's like this...
Nathan didn't leave me a message.
He knew l was due back tonight.
Would you like to share it with me? l gotta get out of town fast. l'm on the lam.
You know what l mean. Help yourself to anything. You know better. l'll see you later on.
How you doing?
Hold it right there!
- Oh, no!
- Hands up, hands up! Feet back! l tried calling the police.
Now just relax here.
Did he hurt you, lady?
No, l'm fine. What did he do?
He killed a woman.
- l didn't kill that woman!
- lt was on TV. l don't care what it was on.
Shoot! l don't care!
Do you wanna know what happened?
Give me a little sip of that. l met a lady in a taxi. l flirted with her. l mailed a package for her. l flirted a bit more. l asked her if she wanted to have a drink. l dropped her off. l went to Madison Square Garden...
...to the circus.
And two guys kidnapped me...
...and took me underneath the Garden, some awful place.
Steam and red lights and slime!
They asked about the girl, the package...
...and they stuck a needle inside my neck.
They stuck a needle in my neck.
Give me a swig.
And l woke up, and the guy says,
''Thank you very much.''
And l went up the escalator...
...and got away. l called the police and told them.
They didn't believe one word. l went back to the hotel because l'm a law-abiding citizen. l find that lady.
She pulls a gun.
Then she slams the door in my face.
So l say, ''That's it.'' l go to the elevator to walk out.
Suddenly l hear bam! l run back, and she's standing in the doorway...
...with blood.
And she falls right into my arms. l catch her and l lay her gently down.
The door opens from a guy with a gun...
...thinking that l killed her.
And he looks at me and he says, '' Freeze!''
Just like you did. l didn't know what to do. l started running. l know l shouldn't have run...
- You shouldn't have killed her.
- l didn't!
Over here! Move it!
Bend over. Bend over.
- What're you doing?
- Bend!
Grab your ass.
Both hands!
Both. That's it.
Things like this don't happen to me. l'm taking you in, killer!
You knocked a policeman unconscious!
That was the worst story.
No one's gonna believe you.
You believed it though! You did!
- Didn't you?
- Yeah. l hope we get adjoining cells.
We'll discuss that with your friend. l'm leaving.
Holy shit!
Oh... l hope everything works out.
They'll blame this one on me too.
- Wait.
- l was just trying to help.
You're the only alibi l've got. lf the police come up...
- Give me your key!
- Key?
- Your key to the apartment.
- All right.
- They're coming!
- lt won't work.
How can you get the keys?
You've gotta open it.
- Where did it go?
- Get out of my purse!
- l gotta get out.
- Mind if l join you?
- Where are we?
- Come on, this way. l got a car a couple of blocks away.
Act normal. l gotta get some clothes.
Cool it.
Get a load of the nut.
That is the nut. lt's the Jordon guy.
Hey, you! Hold it!
- Where you going?
- She's in the dog act.
Hold it right there, Jordon!
- Wait!
- Hey, what are you doing?
Gimme!
Hey, stop him!
Come here. Come back here.
Hey, stop him!
Some moron just stole my act.
Shit!
Come on!
This is insane. l'm wanted for murder.
People are trying to kill me. l gotta get back to Chicago.
How? They'll have everything covered, airports, trains.
- Besides, why run?
- l have no alibi. l was on TV. lf l stand still l'll get jailed for life...
- ...or they'll kill me.
- Push back.
Who should l push back?
The people trying to kill you. l don't know who is.
Didn't somebody see you with those guys?
- '' l'm allergic to elephant shit.''
- So?
Sidney Wicks, the cab driver. l gave him a circus ticket.
They must've talked to him and found me.
We'd better talk to him too.
'' l'm allergic to elephant shit.''
Of course, that's it!
How do l look?
Terrific.
- l don't have any change.
- Here's some change.
- How much?
- Seventy-five cents each.
- Here's a wallet.
- Come on, pal!
- Only in New York.
- Okay, let's go, pal.
- Here's two dollars.
- Two dollars.
- Exact change.
- Exact change.
Does anyone have change for a couple of dollars?
- Buddy, l've got some change.
- Thanks.
- Getting better.
- Thanks.
Thanks very much.
Your cab driver's dead. Heart attack.
- Poor guy. That's it.
- No, that's murder.
You said it was a heart attack.
They got Janet Dunn with a gun, you with a car.
- There's lots of ways to kill.
- What do l do now?
- Start with Janet Dunn?
- She's dead. l mean the package.
That's what they're after. l mailed the package. l put it in the mailbox on Park Avenue.
- How did you know her name?
- l heard you say it to that cop.
- l did?
- Maybe l heard it on the news. lt doesn't matter.
You're right. lf l had it, l'd understand why they're trying to kill me.
Can you remember where you mailed it to?
Cambridge. What good does that do? l grew up in Maine. l go to Boston all the time.
- Don't worry. We'll find it.
- We'll find it. lt's more than my blue eyes.
The eyes help.
But Michael, l'm a reporter.
This is my first real chance.
This is big. l'm on the run with an accused murderer.
And you're innocent.
This could be a great story.
You can't get rid of me. l just hope we live to read your story.
We can't take more chances.
Stay here. l'll get my car.
Wait a minute. This is crazy.
You're gonna get hurt. l'm the only one that believes you that can help. Please, let me.
Stay here, l'll be right back.
- l feel ridiculous.
- But it'll get us by the police.
- They'll look for a tuxedo.
- lt's silly.
We'll buy other clothes in Boston.
The ignition wiring.
Try it.
There's a thousand streets.
We'll never find that address.
Wanna bet?
Relax. Close your eyes.
Close your eyes.
Relax.
383 Harvard Street,
Cambridge, Massachusetts.
- l couldn't get the zip.
- We can't just go.
They'll await that package too.
Are you all right? l'm all right, but l fear for my eggs here. l think they're... l guess l'll have to eat them right away.
Should watch where l'm going.
Put the spinach back in there. l think there's...
- Are there cookies in that bag?
- They're here.
- You're sure none broke?
- l don't think so.
- The eggs are all right.
- They're here.
What is it?
A computer tape.
Why couldn't it be simple? l thought it would be.
A little black book with some names.
A photo of some congressman.
Yeah, or a wanted poster with a signed confession. lt is simple.
All we need is a computer. l know where we can get one. ln Maine. My Uncle John.
He's not my uncle.
He's a friend of my dad's.
He's the head of a computer center.
He can help. l don't wanna talk to a computer. l wanna talk to Terrance Martin.
Janet Dunn sent this to him.
He must know what it means.
That's dumb.
Those guys know the address too.
They'll look for you.
They won't be looking for you.
That's not so dumb.
Gotcha!
You sure did.
Terrance Martin? l'm Kate Hellman. l'd like to talk to you about Janet Dunn.
Come in.
You're asking me to help an accused murderer.
Mr. Martin, l'm asking you to help an innocent man. l know. But you see my problem. l don't know if he is innocent.
They say he killed my ex-wife.
- l should go to the police.
- lf you met him...
The thought of Janet dying like that is...
- l'd like to help, but l...
- Please, please! l must be crazy.
All right, bring Mr. Jordon here. l'll run the tape over to the university.
No, he can't come here.
The men who killed Janet will be watching.
We could meet elsewhere.
We'll call you in an hour.
All right.
Thank you.
Hello, Mr. Martin.
- Hello, Mrs. Strunck.
- How was your trip?
- Fine, just fine.
- How'd they like the lecture?
- Fine, Mrs. Strunck.
- That's nice.
Where is he? You said noon.
He had to be sure that you didn't bring police.
As you can see, there are no police.
- Wait here. l'll go get him.
- All right.
He's upstairs.
Hey, watch it! Are you nuts?
What a man. We're all gonna miss him so terribly.
My God, what a wonderful man.
Man? This is Aunt Gertrude.
Gertrude?
Aunt Gertrude too! l can't stand it! lt's beautiful. ls it early 1800s?
That's close.
- And you grew up here?
- l was born upstairs.
- l'll call Uncle John.
- l hope he can see us tonight.
May l please speak to Dr. Wolff?
He knows me. l'm an old friend.
What time will he be back?
Could you have him call me? l'm at my parents' house. Thank you.
Sounds like somebody should strip. lt ought to. This is how l paid the bills in college.
Shangri-La Club. l played, the ladies showed their tushies.
- You, in a strip club?
- Yeah, l played in a tushie joint.
There's lots of things you don't know.
Michael, l have a confession to make. l lied to you. l'm not a reporter. l don't even know who Nathan Curry is. l got into your apartment with a lock-pick.
You hit that policeman to start me running?
- Yes.
- ln the direction of the tape?
Why?
They murdered my brother.
All that's left is an insane painting on his wall. lt was a couple of months ago.
They found him here.
He had hung himself in the barn.
And the autopsy showed traces of drugs.
Not ''drug'' drugs, but experimental weird stuff.
Whoever injected him drove him mad.
That was the last thing he did.
Why would somebody do that to him?
He was in with the government.
Something secret.
- Someone killed him because of that?
- l want to find out.
- Who was Janet Dunn?
- Robert's girlfriend. She called me.
Asked to meet her at the Vanderbilt.
She had evidence.
She got into your cab, and l had to know who you were.
That was you in the taxi behind us?
Why didn't you tell me this?
- l couldn't trust you.
- You couldn't trust me?
What did you think, l made all this up?
- The best liars look innocent.
- You ought to know.
Sure, l lied to you. l want the people who killed my brother. lf you can't understand that, then screw you.
You got the tape now.
Do whatever you want with it! lt's up to me? lt's up to me?!
Nothing has been up to me since this started!
- Come in.
- Peace?
Peace. l'm sorry. l've been so scared.
Since he died, l've had to be brave.
- l didn't wanna fight.
- l'm sorry too.
And we're not gonna fight anymore. l wanna show you something.
Anything come to mind?
- No.
- l know that's the West. l can feel it. l can tell by the shapes and the colours.
But l don't understand it.
Wait a minute.
Michael! Michael, look at this.
This is it.
The Grand Canyon!
But what are those?
We think Robert painted the grids as a message.
What does it mean?
They could be anything.
Traffic patterns...
...tonal progressions of a Bach fugue...
...goal lines of the Redskins.
- And those numbers?
- Code questions.
Punch in the right responses, you unlock the tape. l don't have the codes to get into this.
- We don't have those responses.
- Who does?
People who can break these codes are in Washington.
- l could get it to them.
- Government people?
Government people are trying to kill me.
- Do you have a match?
- l don't smoke.
- l might.
- There's some on the desk.
- Help an old man out.
- Sure.
Kate, honey, l think we should keep this clean.
You'll find an envelope in the second drawer.
- Here you are, sir.
- Fine.
We're not dead.
Codes can be broken.
Let me think.
You hold on to the tape. l'll call you in the morning.
- Sure thing.
- Come on. l forgot my jacket. l'll be right back.
- Got it?
- Right here.
- All set?
- Take care of her.
Her father was my best friend. l'm sure you will.
- Thanks, Uncle John.
- Goodbye.
We've got a long way to go.
- Long way?
- We're going to Arizona tonight.
- Tonight? Are you crazy?
- l'm tired of waiting.
- You have to do it yourself.
- And Uncle John?
You can stay with him.

Dr. Keller to surgery B, stat.
- You awake, sir?
- Yes.
Dr. John Wolff's on line 3.
- He says it's urgent.
- l'll take it.
- Hello, Jake, how are you?
- l've got a surprise, Hiram. l hope your heart can stand it.
- Wasn't my heart. lt was poison.
- lt fits.
- You've got a big security leak.
- Tell me something l don't know.
How about this?
Somebody dropped off a millibar tape.
A four-tiered code...
...re-access kickback, everything!
- Are you out of your mind?
- l retired, Hiram. l didn't get stupid. Check it!
- Emergency alert.
- Status on millibar.
Try it. l don't know, it's not a millibar tape.
- So it's a copy.
- You helped set up that system.
- Those tapes can't be copied.
- But somebody did it.
And it scares the hell out of me!
That son of a bitch stole it back from me.
Put this in your purse.
- You trust me with it?
- Absolutely.
There it is!
The tower in the painting!
- Mr. Puckett, circle around again.
- Okay.
You were right, Michael. lt's really there!
We got the tower.
The line must've been a road. lt was to the right.
Just fly us straight ahead.
A little bit to the right.
We can't stay up here too long.
- Gas?
- l don't know, maybe.
Something down here.
Been going on a couple of days.
There! There's the road!
Then the grids must be along there.
Okay.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
What is it?
Want me to help you?
What's that?
Mr. Puckett, just say what it is.
Put your hands on the wheel!
Jesus God, don't just...
- Take over.
- Take over what?
What do you want me to take over?
We're flying a piece of cardboard!
You son-of-a-bitch bastard!
God! Don't move! Don't move!
- We're gonna die!
- Help!
- Somebody help us!
- Grab the stick! l don't wanna! l don't know how to fly!
- Just steer!
- l don't know the first thing.
Just stop talking like that!
Mr. Puckett.
Mr. Puckett, are you...
- Are you all right?
- Of course he is!
What are you asking stupid questions for?
- Michael, he's dead!
- He is not dead!
Don't say he's dead.
The man is resting.
- Look at him!
- l don't have to look at him!
- Did you ever hear of gas?
- Michael, watch out!
Michael, do something. l am doing something! l'm crashing an airplane!
Michael, stop! Stop the plane!
- Put on the brakes!
- How?
Put on the brakes!
- Where are the brakes?
- l don't know.
Ask Puckett where the brakes are.
That was close.
- No!
- Oh, my God!
Do you see it, Michael?
Do you see it?
- Yes.
- What is it?
- l see a rock!
- We're gonna crash into it!
- You're getting the hang of it.
- Are you crazy?!
Civilian aircraft 22901 Romeo...
...you're in government airspace.
Turn back.
This is a restricted area.
Repeat, turn back immediately.
Talk to them! Tell them we're... l knew this would happen. l dreamt about this all my life.
Since l was a boy...
...l dreamt this was gonna happen.
Ask him if l bring it in nose first or tail first.
- Michael, he's dead!
- Don't say he's dead. Ask him.
- l can't ask him!
- Will you shut up and ask him?
Mr. Puckett, should he bring it in nose first or tail first?
- What'd he say?
- Michael, he's dead!
- He's not dead, God!
- Do something!
- Where are the wheels?
- l don't know.
Why don't you ask Mr. Puckett?
And why can't l ask Mr. Puckett?
- Miss Smartass. Go on, say it.
- Because he's dead.
Will you stop saying he's dead!
He has gas!
Repeat, civilian aircraft 22901 Romeo.
You're violating government airspace.
Turn back.
This is a restricted area.
Turn back immediately.
Alive! Alive! Thank you, God!
Michael, look!
A mirage.
Section four, level R, blue.
The grids.
This is what your brother painted.
We're waiting.
- Who's watching this?
- That's not important.
Let's get back to it.
This is all supposed to be a big secret...
...but the secret's out.
People are killing!
We don't care about your secret. lt doesn't interest us.
We wanna know who killed her brother and Janet Dunn.
This tape we took is worthless.
Six years of biology grades.
That tape may be harmless, but this is scary. l wanna know how an architect wanted for murder winds up...
...with code numbers in his notebook...
...to the most advanced weapons system ever.
Millibar puts us 20 years ahead.
Lose it, we're years behind.
The way to those numbers is on tape.
Only we have access to it.
Has one of us gotten careless?
That's a nasty insinuation.
Can you back that up?
Gentlemen, please.
We all want answers. l've asked Pruitt to look into it. ln the meantime, we'll question those two.
- Are you all right?
- Yes. You?
- Yeah.
- What's going on? l'm not positive, but l think l have an idea.
- lt's crazy.
- No, it's not.
Somebody wants us to run.
They think l'll lead them to the tape.
You never had the real tape since Maine.
- l didn't think l could trust you.
- And now? l know l can. You had chances to run and you didn't.
You're still here, and l'm glad.
- Come on.
- l have something to tell you. l'm glad too. l think you're wonderful. l thought so. l'm scared. lf they're watching us, what are we gonna do?
As long as they don't know where the tape is, we got a chance.
- Got it.
- Thanks.
Kate, where are you? l'm here.
- l'll be right back.
- A little more. l'm going to get us some breakfast.
Be careful.
Oh, no! This is a bad dream.
Pinch yourself, Jordon. l'll still be here. l've had it! Go ahead, shoot! l'll die in my sleep.
- Get up. We've got the girl.
- You got the girl?
You expect me to believe that?
That's a clichй. l'm tired of hearing...
Shoot! Now, shoot!
Damn it, l'd cut your throat right now if they'd let me.
But they won't let you.
- lt's the tape for the girl.
- Don't hurt her.
Only if you screw up.
We'll do it at noon. Here's the address. lf you're late, we kill her.
Here's your truck keys.
General delivery, Michael Jordon.
You were right.
He mailed it to himself here.
- Sign here, Mr. Jordon.
- Thank you.
- Okay. Have a nice day.
- Thanks.
Oh, please.
God!
- lndian Flats in the southwest desert.
- Sorry, out to lunch.
Can you answer me? ls that asking so much?
Can't you pay me the respect of answering me?
Talk to me, so l don't feel like l'm an idiot!
A life is at stake! l'm not Capone.
- Can't you talk to me?
- l'll talk to you, Mr. Jordon.
Thank you. Thank you, sir.
God bless you. l thought l was going crazy. l'm not a bad person. l know l didn't do such a good thing. l'll pay for the car, but l gotta get out of here now. l'll come back if you want me to.
That wouldn't be appropriate.
There's a girl who's going to die if l don't leave right now.
She knew the risks.
What are you talking about?
- To find her brother's killer.
- Who are you?
Hiram Calder. l head the
National Security Directorate.
You... l...
What...
Are you saying the post office, the taxicabs...
...my truck not starting, that was you?
You played with me all this time? l'm the only person you've ever met...
...and l know who drives
55 miles an hour on the highway!
Who are you people that you can manipulate people's lives?
That girl could be dead now!
Do you know that?
- They won't.
- Why?!
They'll think this is a legitimate arrest. l'm after a traitor who's done the impossible.
He's made a copy of an uncopyable tape l don't care beans for this.
- You got the tape, get the girl.
- l can't. l need the man, and l don't know who he is.
Stop talking.
You're wasting time. l don't wanna hear it.
That's why you and the tape must disappear.
What did you say?
You and the tape will disappear in a public way.
What the hell are you talking about? l'll arrange a spectacular accident.
What?
- Of course you won't be in it.
- Whoopee! Where am l gonna be?
Where would you like to be? Who?
We'll give you a new life. l don't want a new life. lt took me ages to find this one. l like this guy.
The New York police do too.
- You can fix that.
- l know l could.
Are you gonna let that girl die? ls that what you're telling me?
Excuse me, sir,
Washington's on the phone. l don't care!
Are you gonna let that girl die? l'm sorry.
He wants to be a hero.
He is. What have we got? lt's a fake reel. We wired the truck.
You still on him?
Yes, sir. He's running north.
Where's the girl?
What's a four-letter word for ''record''?
Tape. Of course.
Only half of it's here.
You'll get the rest when we're safe.
Kate?
- Michael!
- Oh, no! You're kidding. l'm glad to see you!
- Are you all right?
- Yes. How'd you find me?
Under a truck.
The truck is still moving.
There's a holding pattern on the tape.
They've separated. Stay on it. l'll be in the helicopter.
This is half of nothing, Ransom! lt's a fake!
- We lost the other signal.
- l'll get on Calder.
Kate, they're coming now.
- l need more time.
- There is no more time.
Calder set me up with a fake tape.
Do something. l gotta have more time.
Break it down.
Lacey? l think l'm getting it.
- Hurry, please!
- l'm trying!
Stop right there!
Not one more step!
Right there!
- Hold it right there!
- Move it out. l'll blow us all up, l swear! lt doesn't matter to me.
You're gonna kill us both anyway.
You want me to do it?
You want me to do it?!
All right, get back! Get back!
Sure, shoot me!
You better hope l don't drop this!
All right, get back! Get back!
Go, Kate!
Go! Go!
- Not bad, huh?
- What?
- Not bad, huh?
- You want compliments now?
Back off till l reload.
Get down! l said down, not out!
When l tell you to, start circling.
Now, Kate!
Start circling!
- What are we doing?
- Keep circling until l say stop.
Stop!
Get out, quick!
Goodbye, Michael.
Now we've got them!
THE RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE
On this St. Michael's Sunday in the church of Artigat...
...we receive
Bertrande de Rols...
...daughter of the late
Laurent de Rols and of...
...Raimonde, his wife
And we receive Martin Guerre...
...son of Mathurin Guerre... and of his wife, Brigitte,
Martin wishes to take Bertrande for wife... and keep her all his life
I, Martin, give my body to thee,
Bertrande
I accept it and give my body to thee, Martin
I unite you in the bonds of holy matrimony
You will not regret having followed this story...
...for it is not a tale of adventure...
...nor an imaginary fable
It is a true story
It began one August Sunday, in 1542...
...in the village of Artigat, county of Foix...
...in the reign of Francis I
Bertrande, at her parents' decision...
...brings a dowry of 30 acres of wheat...
...and 40 of millet, at the place called Pomarede
Also one pair of oxen and the Roussas woods...
...inherited from her father
Laurent, deceased
Three dresses, one bed, one linen-chest with lock and key
That's all
Catherine... something to drink
If you still agree, sign here
Seraphin, you will have to blow harder, boy!
It's a good match... well arranged
May the Lord bless this bed with health...
...and keep the Demon from this house
Kiss her, Father
Martin, tender buds need to be sprinkled at night!
You two... kiss your brother
Make us some pretty grandchildren!
The rest... you can do without me
Whenever you want, come eat and dance.
This is Bertrande de Rols
You say at first your husband couldn't...
...consummate your marriage.
Why not?
Because of the spell that had been cast on him
So your mother wanted the marriage dissolved?
Yes... but I didn't
I was married...
I felt bound to him
People knew?
Of course... We had no children
They made fun of him?
Yes... the whole village
Tell me what happened that
Candlemas Day
If you're tired of sleeping at night, change husbands!
Change husbands if you want to have children!
Stop trembling, boy
It's caused by evil thoughts
They put a spell on you
I'll take it away
Blessed Flesh, I unknot you
Blessed Flesh, I unbind you
Blessed Flesh,
I make you grow again
Accursed Demon, leave this servant of the Lord
Merciful God, shed Thy Grace on Martin...
...whose flesh is suffering
Merciful God, shed Thy Grace on Bertrande...
...whose flesh is suffering
And put in all your heart.
Don't be afraid
I am Jean de Coras, of the Toulouse Parliament
I am now in charge of this matter
You must tell me everything, even if the priest said not to
And that worked?
That very day... yes
We had a son... his name is Sanxi
So all was well
For me, yes, but Martin...
Martin kept to himself
He didn't even look at our son
He didn't like farming
He and his father argued
You want us to die of thirst?
Where were you?
You can't do anything right!
Iwas with some soldiers, at the stream
2 sacks of grain are gone...
You seen them?
You stole them
You loaded the grain...
You stole them!
You stole them!
Our family doesn't steal!
I’ll make you hate the taste of bread!
Ididn't take them!
- While I'm alive...
...I'm the master here!
Look, Martin, aren't they pretty?
Wear them Sunday
You cut them too big.
You wasted your time
You always scold me
It's not my fault
Be nice sometimes
That was the night he left
Why steal the grain?
Did he know he was leaving?
And needed money?
Maybe... I don't know
He didn't talk to me much
What did you think?
That he'd be back soon
Everyone thought so
That his father had scared him
He waited for Martin every day for months
Finally he died... killed by sorrow
Martin's mother died a year later
So Melusine married a prince...
...and all her sons became kings
But one Saturday, her husband couldn't resist
He peeked through the keyhole...
...and saw she was a mermaid...
...with scales on her body, and wings on her back
Some people believe she comes back every day...
...secretly, to feed the children
And I believe it, too
She couldn't desert them
Your mother got married again?
Yes... to Pierre Guerre, my husband's uncle
To keep the farms together?
No doubt
Our lands are now held in common
The wolves are out tonight
Make sure the animals are locked up
Yes, mother...
I do it every night
Dirty beast!
Did Martin stay away long?
Eight winters... or nine
You never heard from him?
No... nothing
But I'm sure you had no lack of admirers
No... but I kept my virtue
Speak up, we can't hear you
I kept my virtue
Ask anyone... I remained chaste
You never forgot Martin?
Iprayed to St. Catherine to send him back
So many seasons passed...
Then she heard me.
Who are you?
Do you have some water for a thirsty man?
Who are you?
Don't you recognize me?
Look closely!
Do I know you?
- I think you do
Aren't you Mathurin Guerre's son?
Is it you, Martin?
You're back!
And you're Jacques, Etienne's son
No, Jacques is my brother
Right... you're "Smallpox Andre"
Remember the bear hunt, when Nicolas "castrated" me?
Made me miserable, didn't you?
Martin Guerre is back!
You're bigger, Martin
War does that
Martin Guerre is back!
You've seen him?
Yes! He's down the road
Guillemette... your brother!
Are you sure?
- I saw him!
Bertrande, your husband's back!
Come... it's your husband!
You still here?
Where've you been, Martin?
We thought you were dead!
Hello Jeanne... sister
Martin... at last!
You've changed!
Where's your husband?
Are you Guillemette?
You were so small when I left!
Come kiss your brother
Sanxi?
You're so big
Don't be afraid
Come nearer
I'm your father
Hello, Uncle
You were gone a long time
That's true
Forgive me for what I did
Your father and mother are dead
I heard, and I prayed for them
I also heard you married Raimonde...
...my wife's mother
It's good news
My daughter has suffered
Have you changed for the better?
You're here... it's all true!
Is it really you?
Is that you, Catherine?
You haven't changed
I wondered if you'd ever come back
And here you are, safe and sound
Where's Bertrande?
- At the wash-house
She's waiting for you
It's me, hello
It's me... Martin
Hello, Martin
My God, my wife is beautiful!
It is a gift of God that you have returned
He was in the Army in Picardy
Don't you recognize me?
Who are you?
It's me... Nicolas
It's confusing, seeing you all
I forgot about the bear long ago
I've seen worse
Here's cloth from Flanders
The nicest for Bertrande, with lace
Catherine, take the last one
You've learned to read?
And to write, too
To write?
What did you do all this time?
Ifought in the war
I even went to Spain
Then I wanted to see you
All of you
What's Spain like?
It's dry
And Paris? Did you see Paris?
It's big...
There are people everywhere
I even got lost there
There are thieves at night
You're so strong now, Martin!
Iknew my brother would come back
This calls for a celebration!
When you left here, Martin...
...you didn't have a beard yet
And you didn't drink as much
Now I drink like a monk!
After war... peace!
To you, my wife
A little rough... but not bad
Just enough to kill the worms!
I’ll prepare your bed
It's good to be on your own land
What are you looking for?
The candles
In there
You moved them?
No, they've always been there
Then I forgot
She cried a lot because of you
Remember, Bertrande?
Go get my white breeches...
...the ones lined with silk...
...from the linen-chest
If they're still there
I'll go
You've found your smile
"The bird's back in the nest,
Tonight they will not rest"
They're still there
Waiting for you... like me
I'll wear them tomorrow
How often I've wanted you
I'm here only because of you
So everyone recognized him?
Yes... everyone
His sisters, his uncle...
...Catherine, the servant?
His friends... the whole village
You too?
Me too
Without hesitation?
Then what?
He took up his work, his place at home
We had two children.
The first died...
...the second is alive:
A girl, 18 months old
And everything went well?
Very well
Better than before?
Yes... and he worked hard
Our harvests have never been better
And between you two?
It's been good
When did the doubts first begin?
One day some vagabonds slept in the barn
A game for 15 points?
Idon't gamble
Then buy a saint's image or a holy relic?
Go to the devil, we have a priest!
I’m going back
I'll play
Dominique, play with me
No, I think not... like Martin
Come on Father... only 15 points
Who is he?
Martin Guerre, who went away and came back
Like the prodigal son
He's not Martin Guerre!
Iknew Martin Guerre
At the battle of St. Quentin
In fact, he lost a leg there
Of course it's Martin
I ought to know...
I'm the one who married him
But it's not! He's...
What's his name again?
Iknew him in the Army, too.
It is Martin... we're even related!
Itell you he's not Martin
He's Pansette!
That's it... Pansette
He's from the village of Tihl
I knew him in Picardy, too
What's he doing here?
Isaw two of those people in Arras
From a land called Brazil
Their bodies were all painted
They had feathers on their heads... It's true, Sanxi
Feathers are for them what silk is to us
They were in chains, and made to dance
In their own country, they go naked
Even the women?
Sounds like a nice country
Then you should go there
They eat their prisoner's hearts
And the prisoners consider it a worthy death
Are they human?
Do they have a soul?
The monks say they do
In some tribes, they share their land and their women
In others, the women go to war and make all the decisions
The day women rule here, it'll be the end of the world
Tomorrow we'll have a north wind
No... Let's go home, I'm afraid
Why?
See? A circle of smoke...
Spirits will be out...
We mustn't look at them
Pansette! What are you doing?
Leaving us already?
Trying to find your way?
When are you going?
Did you come to the wrong village?
Imight've known it was you, you snake!
He's strong! Not like Martin... right, Bertrande?
Pansette, you look true but you play false
Beware!
Where was this soldier from?
A garrison in Picardy
Don't believe tales told by strangers...
...and by drunks
Or by rogues!
He's right
"Lies come easy from afar"
We know Martin well
If anyone knows Martin...
...it's us
We must do our accounts one day
How much my land earned in my absence
What do you mean?
You worked my land and I'm grateful... but it made a profit
Now I need the money
I figure it's about 6000 livres
You dare ask me for an accounting?
I, who raised your son while you roamed the world?
I, who protected your wife?
I, who welcomed you back and forgave you?
It was your duty! Iwent to war... I've a right to it!
You have no rights... you left!
Yes, I have!
Ihave the law on my side
I'll seek justice, if I must
You'll be condemned
You threaten your uncle?
Ineed that money!
I’ll sell Gold Cross Field and buy Pusol's...
...to plant barley
You want to sell your father's field?
It's too steep for planting
You're starting to squander our property!
But I expected it
I'm not surprised
I warn you...
...Martin or not Martin
...you won't get away with it!
What did you say?
Repeat that!
So Bertrande, you have doubts too?
Know what they're saying?
You know that if this man isn't your husband...
...you've been living in mortal sin for three years
You know that you're damning your soul
You'll follow him into the depths of Hell
Your flesh will burn
Your eyes will fall into the flames
You will scream but no one will hear
An eternity of suffering awaits you, Bertrande
Aren't you afraid to lie to God?
If you have doubts, why haven't you told me, in confession?
You aren't hiding anything from me?
Beware, Bertrande...
...of the day when the dead come for the living...
...the Day of Judgment!
But when he came back, you recognized him, too
The whole village did
You all welcomed him
Look at Bertrande
She's not complaining
She's never looked better
He'd been gone a long time
What if we were all mistaken?
He's changed a lot, hasn't he?
Reading and writing lead to all kinds of mischief
You're right to stand up to him
I ask you again...
...what if it's not him?
You be careful, too.
After me, it'll be your turn
He'll wipe your ass and take your shirt!
He'll pluck you clean and go away again
Leaving you your eyes to cry with
Then you'll see what kind of man he is!
The work isn't finished!
I’m ashamed for you, Uncle
My father wants you
I'm coming
What do you want?
I’ve thought it over
You're right... I have the money
I owe it to you and I'll give it to you
I don't want any trouble
Know where your father hid money?
No, he never told me
In the hay-loft above the stable
I'll wait for you there at cock's crow
I'll give you your due
But let's keep it to ourselves
Their heads are empty so they tell tales
They're all jealous
Seeing us happy makes them piss vinegar
All they talk about is us
Calm down, my uncle has understood... He'll shut them up
Give me your hand
Let me guide you
Is that her name?
Yes, that's my name
It's in the grain chest
You wanted it, right?
You wanted what we owe you?
You're going to get it!
Your money's worth...
...in hard cash!
You won't ask for it again!
At your service, Pansette!
Hit hard, he has a tough hide!
Go on, Antoine, or I'll disinherit you!
You were ready to die for him?
Yes, to protect him
Explain something to me
You defended your husband, risking your own life
But when his uncle attacked him legally...
...you didn't say anything
You should've protested
Talked to the judge
Told everyone:
I know he's my husband
But you said nothing
Why?
Did you have doubts, too?
How could you, of all people, have had doubts?
At one moment, I was troubled
I wavered
I thought...
Speak up
I thought: Maybe he's fooling me, too
Charming me, as he did others
Then my daughter is a bastard
And I'm living in sin and will go to Hell
Yes... I had doubts
And still have?
No, not any more
Then he is your husband
Yes or no?
I say yes
And what does he say?
The same thing, obviously
He says they're man and wife
It got so confusing,
I took it to the Parliament
They're all here
Come with us
Go join your family
You are Martin Guerre?
Yes, I am
You're quite sure?
I don't know of any other
You're going to pay!
You're an impostor!
You tricked us!
The law will punish you, you cheat!
You tricked us, to steal our property
Slander! To avoid paying what you owe me!
I owe you nothing!
You're not my nephew!
I am and you know it!
Everyone knows it!
Eat your words!
The family apart... over here
Now listen to me, all of you
Those who honestly think...
...this man is not Martin Guerre, to my left
Those who honestly think...
...he truly is Martin Guerre, to my right
And you?
I am their priest
But surely you have an opinion
The others have no opinion?
In settlement of this dispute...
...I, Jean de Coras, Counselor of the Toulouse Parliament...
...declare that there is no reason...
...to believe this man is not Martin Guerre
The charge is dismissed due to lack of proof
This man shall be released
Pierre Guerre is condemned to pay...
...500 livres to the King and to his nephew, for calumny
Free him
You are a knave! God knows it and will punish you!
You hold water in one hand, fire in the other
That was an excellent judgment
What happened to my brother?
You should be in bed
On your feet!
This time we've got you
Get dressed
Get up, you're under arrest!
I was released yesterday!
Things changed during the night
This time your wife signed, too
Get dressed, you're going to Toulouse
When did she sign?
Last night, before going to bed
Is it true?
They made you sign?
This time you're done for
The accusation is the same
But it will be more difficult to answer
Your wife signed
It's a forgery
If so, why did she let them arrest you?
Her uncle and cousins scare her
They might cut her throat
They've threatened her?
Often
Especially lately
She now says you betrayed her
That you're not her husband...
That's serious
I know her...
They forced her to sign.
Assure her safety and ask me what you want
You'll see I'm Martin Guerre
We've heard many witnesses...
...and we shall hear more
Shall a counselor defend you?
I don't need help to prove who I am
Who married you?
Father Dominique Caylar... he's still there
He doesn't like me...
I swear a lot
We married on St. Michael's day,
18 years ago
Who was the notary?
Jehan Pegala, from Fosset
He was late, my father was upset
Bertrande's dowry was the
Roussas woods...
...her lands at Pomarede and two oxen...
...a bed with feather pillows...
...and three dresses
And sacks of grain, have you forgotten?
No... no sacks of grain
Since returning, you've been a loving husband
That wasn't so before
Had I known my wife better,
I wouldn't have left
And she's changed
So have I
You're not stupid
You know you risk death?
It's all Pierre Guerre's doing!
I was his nephew until
I wanted my money
Everyone knew me: My sisters, my wife's mother...
...even my wife
Others also say you're not Martin
My uncle's rich
They're afraid of him!
He acts out of self-interest!
He'd rob me of my name and my property!
It's outrageous!
Follow me
You are Jean the Spaniard and Valentin Rougier?
You asked to see this man
Do you know him?
Yes... it's him
Who is he?
What's his name?
It's Arnaud
They call him Pansette
Where's he from?
Our village
He's from Tihl
You're sure?
He left a long time ago but that's him
Not Martin Guerre, from Artigat?
No... Arnaud, from Tihl
Called Pansette
Look at them!
They're sent by my uncle!
Bought and paid for!
Look at them... shame written on their faces!
They're from Tihl, that's been verified
So what? My uncle has influence
Why should I pretend?
To have a house and a wife
But it's my house and my wife!
I’m wronged... and I'm accused!
Never was a husband so maligned!
But I'll appeal... to the Parliament here!
I want my uncle to be punished
So it'll all be clear!
I want them all here
First Pierre, guilty of bearing false witness
Also my sisters and cousins
And my wife who was forced to sign, and all the villagers
Artigat has been my parish for 23 years
I knew Martin Guerre well,
I married him
When he left, he was thinner, darker and a bit stooped
He had a cleft chin and slightly drooping lips
And a hairy mole on his neck
Show us
Here, in the neck
There's no trace of it
And a scar above his right eyebrow...
...also not there
No, sir... that's wrong!
I knew Martin when he was little, too
I diapered him... and saw him naked, more often than you!
He had no hairy mole
He had a scar on his forehead... and still has!
It was closer to his eyebrow
It was here... I ought to know
He fell in the barn,
I picked him up
Also... open your mouth...
...he broke two teeth
There they are, in back
And a pushed-in thumbnail!
So you maintain that he is
Martin Guerre?
I’m sure, sir... as sure as night follows day
May I speak?
I’ve seen death
I've heard the roar of cannon and the screams of the wounded
You wish me ill, Uncle, but I've lived through worse
But must that be a man's fate...
...for wanting to live a little...
...before returning to his family...
...to work the land God gave us?
Don't let him talk any more!
He's clever with words
We know who he is now
All he wanted was my nephew's property
I don't want to take it,
I'm defending it!
He's not my nephew!
Ask the cobbler, he'll prove it
Cobbler... step forward
Is it sure they'll let me go?
If I say what I have to say, can I leave?
I guarantee you'll return to your village
Before he left, Martin had a very large foot
His size was 12 points
After he came back...
...his size was only 9 points!
You're quite sure?
Yes, and in my trade
I've seen feet grow bigger...
...but I've never known feet to shrink
You're getting old!
Your sight's going...
You forget things
I see better than you, you old mule!
You see where your interest lies!
Jacmette, your fingers remember
Tell them who I am...
Tell the truth
You're Martin Guerre
Bertrande, my wife, you know me better than anyone
Swear I'm not your husband and I will yield
Swear it on the Holy Gospel
You won't swear it?
Therefore I am your husband?
You are my husband
Come forward, Bertrande
And this cross?
I didn't draw it
Then why didn't you protest?
They threatened me
To throw me out.
- She's lying... that cross is her mark!
- It's the truth!
They'll do anything...
They tried to kill me!
It's her mark...
I saw her sign it!
I didn't sign!
I would've signed my name!
How? You can't write!
I’d like a quill and some paper
All this fuss over money!
Pierre knows it's his nephew
Mass at six in the morning, for everyone
Pierre, how long are we staying here?
I don't know...
As long as it takes
Who pays for it?
I’ll pay you
Enough to live on... that's the law
Who is Bertrande de Rols?
Why do you want her?
She's to be lodged separately
It's me, Bertrande de Rols
Follow me with your children, by order of the Parliament
Blessed Virgin Mary, see my distress and my sorrow
Please, help me
Protect me. I feel so lonely...
I brought some chestnut bread
It's from our village
It's cold here
My only child...
Do you want to ruin us?
But for you, that impostor would have been executed by now
He seems to have bewitched you
You're under a spell...
You only see him
All he's after is our property
Your husband has bewitched you.
My own mother attacks us
If he isn't my husband, why did you wait three years?
I wasn't clear before
Now we know he's not Martin
I was always suspicious of him
He uses you and you say "Amen!"
He's my husband... I know he is
Didn't Pierre offer money to Dominge at your inn?
Accused, sit down and stay seated!
Continue
Didn't he?
Money to pay for killing me!
Call Dominge Pailhas
Don't be afraid
Did Pierre offer you money?
Be honest... yes or no?
Yes, he offered me money
I said I wouldn't kill a relative...
...even for money
I'm sort of related to Martin
It's true, that's what he said
Thank you. You may go now
Come, Jeanne.
Speak up now.
Didn't Uncle urge my wife to accuse me?
It's true
Didn't he threaten to throw her out?
It's true.
Didn't he raise his hand to her?
It's a lie!
Let me talk to her husband
Accused, remain seated!
Come, Augustin
You lived under our roof
After the soldier had been there...
...you said: Be careful
My uncle was sending people after me to beat me up
Remember?
To teach me a lesson
You must remember.
We'd beaten the Vals team...
...4- 2. A Sunday in August!
I remember
It's true
So, Uncle, you thought
I'd never find out?
He's the impostor... the criminal!
He should be sitting here
If Arnaud of Tihl was a sinner...
...who profaned God...
...what do I care?
I’m not Arnaud of Tihl!
I’m not this man!
I’m not!
The man's memory is prodigious...
...and he's very clever
What if he were a demon?
It has happened before
Demons like to enter human beings...
...and poison their minds
What do you say?
Lies have a thousand faces...
...even the Demon's
Truth has only one
And justice exists...
...to discover the truth
Jacmette Cayrol has gone to God
Beat the devil out of him!
Stop fighting
Stop it! Jacmette is dead!
Jacmette is dead
He knew everything better than anyone in the village
When he came back...
...he knew my sons' names
He'd look at me...
I couldn't move
I felt that I was...
...on fire!
I’m sure he uses magic
Even here, with all of us!
Since the world began...
...Satan has had a store of magic
How can he know so much?
And have all the answers?
He is the Devil's emissary
Perhaps he is a devil himself!
I’m not a devil...
Be seated
If a devil is in you, speak
Tell us his name
A devil?
Then I'd be with my wife!
I wouldn't have been arrested!
I wouldn't be here!
He answered well
There's no proof of any magic
What should we do?
Any suggestions?
The most humane solution...
Presume innocence if guilt is not proven
But first...
...I'd like another chance to question...
...Martin Guerre's wife
The Court turns to you
Now...
...and for the last time...
...I ask you...
...if that man is your husband
Yes... I'm sure
How can you be absolutely certain?
Speak... We are here to learn all
On his return, he knew all about me
Did he know intimate details...
...only a husband could know?
What details?
He knew when I wanted him...
...and the words to say
Before...
...during...
...and after
The Court...
...will now retire to deliberate
I think that does it
This peasant seems to have won his case
He's Martin Guerre
It would be inhuman not to free him
We'll clear his name
Could anyone else have defended him better?
In the name of the King and of his justice...
...this Parliament...
...hereby declares...
...that the accused is indeed...
...is indeed Martin...
A new witness insists on being heard
Have him come forward
You claim to be Martin Guerre?
Yes... that's my name
Where were you?
In Picardy... the Army
I lost my leg at St. Quentin
When I arrived in Artigat,
I heard my family was here.
Here I am
Do you know that man?
We soldiered together
His name?
He's Arnaud of Tihl... Pansette
Don't listen! Look at them...
Having lost, they try a ruse!
A beggar, hired by my uncle!
Do you know that woman?
Bertrande, my wife
It's one last low trick!
You wrong me... and you insult me?
Wrong you?
I’ve never laid eyes on you!
Why don't you arrest him?
A hired liar!
Pierre Guerre, come forward.
Where is your wife?
Do you know this man?
Yes, I recognize him
Martin, my nephew
Let me hug you.
At last you're back
You're quite sure?
Yes, I'm sure
He's my brother's son
He's my son-in-law, returned to us by God
Arrest him!
- Sit down!
Proof he was paid!
He arrives now...
...just in time, like a miracle!
It's God's doing
The hand of God, manifesting itself
It's divine justice
God has sent him...
...to prevent injustice!
Don't forsake me!
It's a plot against me
In my own family!
Please listen to me once more...
I'm Martin Guerre, from Artigat
He's a paid liar
He was taught what to say, but I will confound him
Let me put him to the test!
You claim to be me! Tell me...
...on my wedding night...
...who gave us the nuptial bowl?
She did. Catherine Bore...
She tucked us in
Just after the wedding
I was bewitched
How many masses were said for me?
It's so long ago... and I'm tired
Answer!
Six...
- He's wrong! He doesn't know!
Not six... four!
Dominique Caylar, answer.
Tell the truth
I said four masses, it's true
You should have been better informed
Where was the spell broken?
At the priest's
Was it hot or cold?
Cold... I was naked
We warmed up quickly!
Who bought the sacks of grain
I stole?
Smallpox Andre
You learned that lesson well
When I went away, what did I leave...
...in the linen-chest upstairs?
What did I leave?
I left it! What was it?
White breeches!
Sewn by Bertrande... and you didn't know!
But I told you.
- No, I told you!
Don't twist it around!
Arrest him!
I’ve proven I'm Martin Guerre
You say you told him?
And he's trying to use it!
But before you said...
...you didn't know him
Accused, sit down
The sisters, come here
Which one is your brother?
Make up your minds
This is my brother
No, you're making a mistake!
And you, Guillemette?
What do you say?
I can't remember
I was too little
Maybe it's him
He's my father!
You treated me like a brother...
I am your brother!
Silence!
What do you say?
Of no importance...
I'm not family
Catherine... tell them
Forgive me, Martin
Don't cry... Women cry easily
You should have known your own husband
Our house is dishonored
It's all your fault
You're to blame, Martin
You betrayed my friendship
You deserve no pity
What harm in caring for a woman her husband deserted?
We await your confession,
Arnaud of Tihl
It's true
We soldiered together
He talked about his wife...
...his son, his house
One day on the road, two men took me for him
They called me Martin
It gave me an idea
I thought...
...why not take his place?
So I learned all I could
Martin said he wasn't going back
I went to Artigat
I was taken for him
I almost told them...
"I fooled you!
Martin's up north!"
I almost said it
Then I saw you
I took you in my arms
Next day, it was too late
After that, I learned whatever I didn't know...
...from my uncle, sisters, wife
And I remember it
There's no magic in it...
...I swear it
You don't deserve her
I know her better than you do
I ask you all to forgive me
And you...
...who were my wife
Your men can stay in the barn
Are you thirsty?
Where's Bertrande?
At home
Pierre Guerre, you brought discord to this village
Now keep the peace
Leave us, please
I'm thirsty
You have dared much and feared God very little
We hesitated before declaring you innocent
It was unwise to take that stranger into your bed
Women are often the victims...
...of men's wickedness
That's why we acquitted you...
...and legitimized...
...your daughter's birth
We hope that now...
...you will be a good wife
But tell me...
...so I'll understand
Before Arnaud appeared...
...you needed a man?
And this one pleased you?
Did he satisfy your needs?
You loved each other?
You knew from the start?
You can tell me
It will go no farther
Arnaud and I...
...were good together
Martin had neglected me
Arnaud respected me...
...like a true husband
I trusted him
We thought of asking to be judged
We could have won
If Martin hadn't turned up, we'd be man and wife
No one could've denied it
At the last minute...
...why did you change?
Why choose Martin?
In Arnaud's eyes...
...I saw it was hopeless
I saw what he wanted
He wanted me to live... for me and my children
So I did it
God forgive me,
I defiled marriage!
The King, the law, all those I offended...
...forgive me!
Get up, Arnaud
Open the door
Forgive me God,
I defiled marriage!
The King, the law...
...all those I offended!
Forgive me God,
I defiled marriage!
The King, the law...
...all those I offended!
Commend your soul to God
The story of false
Martin Guerre...
...ended that morning
The Counselor, Jean de Coras impressed by this...
...daring imposture, made a record of it
12 years later came...
...the St. Bartholomew Massacre
For his Protestant beliefs...
...Jean de Coras was hung before the Toulouse Parliament...
...with a hundred of his friends
But we live only by the spirit
Baba!
How can we fight for freedom... when our fathers sit in the government's beer halls and get drunk?
Boycott these places!
The beer that you drink buys the bullets that kill your children!
Come on, boys!
Watch your wing!
Come on!
- Yes.
- Come on, Johan!
- Yes!
- He's got a great future.
That was brilliant!
Like father, like son.
- To your family!
- To our headmaster!
- You coming, Gordon?
- Yes, Mr. Ben.
Jonathan will come and help me.
How is Jonathan?
The algebra still giving him trouble?
He's working hard, Mr. Ben.
Your money will not be wasted.
- Emily and me will always thank you.
- That's fine.
- See you later, Gordon.
- All right, Mr. Ben.
Get inside.
Come to Grandpa.
Just like your ma.
Be gentle with Grandpa, Piet.
Don't hit Grandpa.
Smell.
Almost ready, Chris. Any minute.
No, come on, keep your hands off, man.
Johan, man, come on, bring it...
Next time you get the fork.
Jonathan.
I'm sorry, Gordon, but they must have had a reason.
I know my son, Mr. Ben.
If he says he was not doing anything,
I believe him.
The court didn't.
Was he represented?
Our lawyer, Julius Ngakula, is in detention.
- That's why I came to you, Mr. Ben.
- Ben?
I'll be there in a minute, darling.
Get some iodine, will you?
God.
Johan.
Jonathan, did you tell the court exactly what happened?
What does he know about court?
Before he knew, it was all over.
We need a good lawyer, Mr. Ben.
It's too late for a lawyer, Gordon.
There's nothing to be done now.
You don't understand, Mr. Ben.
I don't want him to have a police record.
It will be there for the rest of his life.
It's such a minor matter. Let it go, Gordon.
Here. Put that on his backside.
I'm not worried about those wounds.
I know they'll get better.
It's the wounds here.
These are the ones I worry about.
There's nothing to be done.
The cuts looked terrible, Pa.
He must have done something.
- What happened to him?
- The court sentenced him to a caning.
These kids are going mad. Bloody savages.
The only language they understand is force.
I thought the idea was to give them their own homelands.
Let them live with their own kind.
No conflict then. Everybody's happy.
Come on. Enough talk. Let's eat.
I don't care what other parents are saying.
Now, listen to me.
I tell you, no demonstrations.
Tomorrow you go to school.
But there'll be nobody at school, Baba.
Then you and Robert will be the only ones.
What do I say to Mr. Ben?
"Thank you for the school fees, but my son doesn't want to learn"?
Let Mr. Ben keep his white money for his Boer education.
We want to learn in English.
We don't want to learn Afrikaans.
You don't understand, Baba.
They don't want us to be really educated.
If we learn in Afrikaans, we have no future, Baba.
They want us to be messenger boys, mine boys...
And garden boys like me.
Yes, Baba.
Everybody knows that you're a wise man.
Everybody comes to ask your advice.
And they respect you.
You should be a lawyer, Baba.
But what are you?
This is a peaceful demonstration.
We know the police will come.
But be calm. Be cool.
Remember, this is a protest march.
We are not here to fight the police.
Let's go.
Bantu education!
Now you listen to me!
This is an illegal demonstration.
I order you to disperse immediately!
This is the last warning!
Disperse immediately, or I will take action!
Tear gas!
Ready!
Fire!
Watch out!
After them!
This way.
They're behind you.
Jonathan!
You killed my sister. Shoot me!
I said shoot me now! Shoot me!
Tell me again.
You were there when all this happened?
Yes, Baba.
- And you say you saw everything?
- Yes, Baba.
Are you sure it was Jonathan they took away?
Yes, Baba Gordon.
And they arrested Wellington, too.
It's hell out there.
I've been like an ambulance all day, taking children to the hospital.
One even died in the car.
God knows how many the bastards killed.
It's happening in Alexander, Springs, all the townships.
Stanley, they've arrested Jonathan.
He's not on the list.
Okay, baasie, but is that all the names, baasie?
I've told you, he's not in custody.
Are you trying to make me out as a liar?
No, baasie.
Why don't you try the hospital, the mortuary?
I will, baasie. What about headquarters, baasie? John Vorster Square, baasie?
- That's enough! Move on! Next.
- Okay. Dankie, baasie.
That's three this morning, Pa.
Hi, Gordon.
Gordon, where have you been the last two days?
Hold it, champ.
Gordon, I'm talking to you.
What's the trouble, man?
- They arrested Jonathan.
- Not again. What for?
There is big trouble in the townships.
They're killing our children.
Gordon...
I saw the bodies, Mr. Ben.
Many have been detained.
I went to the hospital.
To the mortuary. Everywhere.
The police deny they've got Jonathan.
He disappeared.
Why didn't you tell me?
I am telling you.
Let me see what I can find out.
Ian McKenzie, please.
Benjamin Du Toit.
We met at Peter Crozier's.
Hello? Yes.
Ben, telephone.
Hello? Here.
How did they say he died, Mr. Ben?
- In the rioting.
- In the rioting?
They buried him is all I know, when nobody came to claim the body.
- They buried him where?
- I don't know.
You don't know?
That was all Mr. McKenzie could find out.
Then I'll find out.
As God is my witness,
I'll find out what really happened...
- and where he lies.
- Please, Gordon.
It's a terrible thing, but there's really nothing more we can do, you or I.
That's what you said when they whipped him.
But he's my child.
His body belongs to Emily and me.
Jonathan!
- Good night, Pa.
- Bed already?
Come. Bed, sweetheart.
Go to sleep.
He's taking this hard.
God, I haven't seen that in years.
Jonathan made it, remember?
Come to bed.
I'll be in, in a minute.
Okay.
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yeah?
Have you seen this boy inside?
No, I didn't see him.
This is my own child. They took him in.
No, I didn't see him.
Did you see this child inside?
He's my son. Inside there.
Emily.
Julius Ngakula, our lawyer.
So you are the cleaner at John Vorster Square?
Yes, sir.
- How long have you worked there?
- Twenty years, sir.
Where did you see Jonathan?
I saw him in the cell, Mr. Julius.
Did you speak to him?
I talked to him and said:
"My child, what have they done to you?"
But he could not answer.
And then a policeman came.
- It's me, Wellington.
- Wellington?
Come in.
They released me this afternoon.
- My mother said that you wished to see me.
- Yes.
What have they done to you?
Two times, they put a wet bag on my head.
You can't breathe, Baba.
You think you're going to die.
They never stopped, Baba.
They kept asking,
"Who are the ringleaders?"
But, what can I tell them?
I know nothing.
I heard Jonathan next door.
He was screaming in Afrikaans.
Asseblief mei, baas.
Then it was very quiet.
And the man said, "Come on, Ngubene.
"Get up.
"Stop pretending. "
That's all I know, Baba.
Later, somebody said... he was taken to the hospital.
I never saw him again.
Take the bastard away.
Lieutenant, I told you this man was trouble.
Come and help us!
The Afrikaners suffered under the British rule... and decided to take to the interior, to find land far from the British.
On the Great Trek, they had to fight many native tribes.
The Xhosas, Zulus, Tswanas...
Basothos, and many others.
They beat them, and had farms all over South Africa.
All right, little monkeys, time's up.
Thank you, Swanepoel.
You wanted to see me?
I'm sorry, Mr. Ben.
My name is Emily.
Gordon is my husband.
What's happened?
I have an appointment with Colonel Viljoen.
My name is Benjamin Du Toit.
Sign this form, please.
- Meneer Du Toit.
- Come in, Meneer Du Toit.
- Colonel Viljoen. Captain Stolz.
- Pleasure to meet you.
I used to watch you play for the Transvaal.
You were one of the great flyhalves.
That was a long time ago.
- Would you sign an autograph for my son?
- With great pleasure.
- What's his name?
- Jaanie.
My son will be thrilled.
- He plays rugby?
- Soccer.
Traitor.
- Thanks very much. See you later, Colonel.
- Thank you.
Please sit down.
So you're inquiring about detainee Gordon Ngubene.
Yes.
I thought there might have been some kind of misunderstanding...
- that I could help straighten out.
- Misunderstanding?
I've known Gordon Ngubene for over 15 years, Colonel.
He is an honest, diligent, hardworking African.
I can't imagine why he's being detained.
You'd be surprised how many... honest, churchgoing Bantu we come across during a working day.
Meneer Du Toit, our task is not an easy one.
The press screaming bloody murder, especially the English... and they will be the first to squeal if the Reds took over, make no mistake.
We're just doing our job.
I'm sure you understand.
Of course I understand, Colonel.
I know how complex your position is.
I was just trying to say that... we're only human, and we can all make a mistake.
Yeah, we can indeed.
Meneer Du Toit, we can indeed.
And I think one might have been made here.
Would you mind if I asked you a few questions about Ngubene?
I'd welcome it.
Did he ever discuss his son's death with you?
I was the one who broke the news to him.
But he accepted the truth?
Well, he was upset, of course.
But he is a religious man, and in time he will resign himself to it, I'm sure.
You mean he hasn't?
Was he angry? Rebellious?
Come along, Colonel.
If someone told you that your child had died... and wouldn't tell you how it happened or where the body was buried... wouldn't you be upset?
We told him how his son died.
And when the time is right, we will tell him where he's buried.
What are you waiting for?
- You have a son, Meneer Du Toit?
- Yes.
Does he burn and destroy everything he can lay his hands on?
No. And neither does mine.
That's what I can't understand... after everything the government does for them, with an open heart.
Think about it.
We're for you, not against you.
Believe me,
I'm with you all the way, Colonel.
If Ngubene is the innocent man you claim, he will be released soon.
You have my word.
Thank you, Colonel. May I ask a favor?
Gordon's wife is very worried.
May she bring him a change of clothes and some food?
Of course. No problem.
And thank you for your help.
Thank you.
Come on, you bloody bastard... who else has been feeding you this bullshit?
Why don't you answer, kaffir?
Who told you to collect the affidavits?
I want my son's body.
All right, kaffir.
Let's start again.
Sepati, get the drinks ready, would you?
What do you want?
Sorry, Madam. We have come to see Mr. Ben. I am Gordon's wife.
The teeth were in the pocket of the shirt she exchanged the clean one for.
Yes. One moment.
One of his partners can see you immediately.
Yes.
Dick Peterson...
22 Hilldown Road.
Got it. Thank you.
I'm sorry to have done this to you on a Saturday, Mr. McKenzie, but...
Yes, thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Ben.
You must not give up hope, Emily.
Hope is a white word, lani.
It's not hope we need.
Come, Sisi.
Tomorrow it'll be all first class again.
Why would they arrest an innocent man, Ben?
Our Special Branch is too busy rounding up terrorists and communists.
These are not nice times, Ben.
There are subversives everywhere.
Anton, you know Gordon.
He's a gardener, for God's sake.
I don't know anything about Gordon, Ben, and neither do you.
He tends the flowers, he trims the hedges.
That's all know about him.
Ben, blacks lead double lives.
One you see, and one you don't.
That's what I like about them.
Trust me. They'll smile at you one moment and knife you the next.
All Gordon was trying to do was find his son's body.
- That's not a crime.
- Then he has nothing to worry about.
Except his teeth.
How do you feel today?
Are you ready to talk or ready to fly?
Captain?
Don't ever open that door without knocking!
Yes, Captain.
Do you think it will be ready for Piet's birthday?
Stanley.
Gordon is dead.
They say he committed suicide.
Hanged himself.
My God!
Why would he commit suicide?
I said, they say he committed suicide.
What do you mean?
What do I mean? What about Timol, who they say jumped from the 10th floor?
What about Ngudle? What about Mosala?
Joyi? Malele? I've got 37 others for you.
They all died in that John Vorster Square.
All suicide, huh?
Where is his body? In Soweto?
I'd like to see him.
Look, I came here to deliver Emily's message, that's all.
Don't be silly, Ben.
I want to see him, Susan.
There are riots all over Soweto.
Don't look for trouble, man.
- I want to see him.
- You're out of it, so stay out of it.
I'll drive myself then.
What you gonna do, lani?
Buy yourself a map?
Okay. Finish.
Welcome to the land of love and glory.
Come on.
Hurry.
Okay. He's okay.
Hi, Stanley. Who's that?
Meneer Du Toit, I'm sorry to bother you.
I'm Melanie Bruwer.
I write for The Rand Daily Mail.
Is it possible to talk to you about Gordon Ngubene?
I understand that you've known him for some years.
No.
What is Emily going to do now?
- She wants an inquest.
- Really?
Good. I'll ask Ian McKenzie to help her.
If it makes you feel good, lani.
Will you take me to the funeral?
Are you crazy?
That's no place for you, man.
Here. Take this number.
In case you need me and I'm not there, just say, lani phoned. All right?
What does lani mean, anyway?
That's enough for one day, man.
Thank you.
Hello, Ben!
- What was the point of coming here?
- What?
- Gordon has been murdered.
- Oh, come on.
I saw his body.
I could barely recognize his face.
- He was murdered.
- Hello, Susan.
And what about you, Pa?
Going off to Soweto.
You could have been murdered.
Mr. Du Toit, sir.
Mr. Du Toit.
- How do you do, Mr. McKenzie?
- How do you do? Won't you sit down?
I beg your pardon.
- I'm terribly sorry.
- I'm sorry you're not feeling fit.
Well, I actually feel rather spry as things go.
Unfortunately,
I fell in love with these flowers 10 years ago.
And I've looked after them.
I've cared for them.
And then, like naughty mistresses... they've shown their thanks by giving me a permanent allergy.
But I've found myself with an undying affection for them.
Especially this beautiful, troublesome wench.
There must be something you can do.
Bloody doctors tell you anything, take your money...
I take these lozenges.
Totally ineffective, but they're rather tasty.
I'm rather fond of the lavender one.
Would you care for one?
No, thank you.
I'm terribly sorry.
Would you like a cup of tea?
No, thank you.
I'm here on a matter of justice.
Oh, justice.
I'm afraid that's a trifle more complex to serve you up... than a cup of tea.
But, in any event, please do go on.
Gordon Ngubene.
You remember the story of Gordon Ngubene?
Yes, dreadful, dreadful story.
I want justice for him to the full extent of the law.
You see, justice and law...
Mr. Du Toit, are often just...
I suppose they could be described as distant cousins.
And here in South Africa, they're simply not on speaking terms at all.
And I've familiarized myself with your dossier.
And I'm afraid that my counsel to you is to just give it up.
- Give it up?
- Yes.
Because there is nothing to be done.
That's what I said to his son when his son was caned.
And now his son is dead.
That's what I thought that about Gordon when he was jailed.
Now he is dead because of my neglect.
I have known that family for 15 years, Mr. McKenzie.
I cannot give it up.
Yes.
That does make a difference, of course.
There must be some penalty under law for those who commit murder.
Mr. Du Toit, may I ask you... how long you have lived with us in South Africa?
All my life.
I'm afraid that I am...
I'm just not the barrister that you're seeking.
I'm sorry.
I'm confused, Mr. McKenzie.
I thought that you had undertaken many cases and won them... in support of human rights.
No, you see, what you don't realize... that every time I've won a case, they simply changed the law.
So, therefore, my considered counsel to you... is to just simply chuck the lot.
I shall find another barrister, and I shall prove you wrong.
Good afternoon, Mr. McKenzie.
Please sit down, Mr. Du Toit.
I will take your case.
I will take your case, if only to make it abundantly clear... how justice in South Africa is misapplied... when it comes to the question of race.
Emily, how are you?
- This is Father Masonwane.
- Benjamin Du Toit.
- This is my friend, Margaret Ledwaba.
- Benjamin Du Toit.
Please.
Here, take this one.
Emily, I have been to see Mr. McKenzie... and he has agreed to represent you at the inquest.
Thank you, Mr. Ben.
He's the best we can get.
You mean well, sir, but it is better to forget.
If we keep the pain alive, the hate will weaken our faith.
They killed my child, who was a good child.
They killed my husband, who did what a father must do.
People must know the truth.
The living close the eyes of the dead.
And now the dead will open the eyes of the living.
Are you not afraid of the road you are taking, Sister Emily?
No.
We are now leaving beautiful Soweto, the high-class slaughterhouse.
Who are you, Stanley?
A mean black cat in the night, lani.
I bet you are.
- And Emily?
- She is like a sister.
- We grew up together.
- Then you're a Zulu?
Zulu, Xhosa, Sotho, whatever.
I'm African, that's all.
Me, too.
My father had a farm.
I grew up like any African boy in the bush.
Ate African porridge.
No shoes except Sunday.
Barefoot. No vote. Carry passbook.
Robben Island jail. Careful, lani.
Yeah.
- Good morning, Dr. Herzog.
- Morning.
I was wondering if you could assist me in identifying these objects.
Do you recognize them?
The appear to be human teeth.
Yes, they're from the body of the deceased.
Gordon Ngubene.
It may be so.
Were you notified by Captain Stolz?
Yes...
Ngubene complained of a toothache.
And what was noteworthy about his appearance?
Nothing.
You see, the police report reads:
The injuries to his head and body were extensive.
Doesn't that stir your memory just a trifle?
I don't know.
You don't know whether it does or not?
I remember pulling the rotten teeth from his mouth.
And did you administer an anesthetic... before you tore the teeth from his jaws?
I don't recall.
And who ordered you to pull those teeth?
I don't recall.
Dr. Herzog, what day is it today?
Friday, the 24th.
I'm greatly relieved.
I thought that you have lost complete control of your faculties.
That will be all. Thank you.
No more questions.
The deceased was arrested on the 27th of July, was he not?
Yes.
And what was the reason for Gordon Ngubene's apprehension?
He was in possession of incriminating documents.
I have an objection.
Good morning, Captain Stolz.
Good morning, Mr. McKenzie.
We have before us no evidence whatsoever... that these documents were incriminating,
Your Worship.
Can you not give us an example,
Captain Stolz?
Yes. He subscribed to a newspaper called The World For Black Workers.
Well, I subscribe to
The World For Black Workers.
Do you suppose, Your Worship, that places me... in some jeopardy of arrest and detainment?
I have nothing to add, Your Worship.
Objection overruled. Continue with your evidence, Advocate Louw.
I beg your pardon, Your Worship.
Did you say that my objection is overruled?
Yes, overruled.
Now, tell the court about his death.
I was called at 605 hours.
I was notified that the detainee was hanging by a rope tied to the window bars.
Yes. And then?
I summoned Dr. Jansen to make a post mortem.
Thank you, Captain Stolz.
Are you aware, Captain Stolz... that a post mortem examination was carried out... on behalf of the Ngubene family?
Yes. By Dr. Hassiem, whose signature is also there.
And where is the good doctor now?
- Detained.
- Under what charge?
The Internal Security Act.
Is this his signature?
Yes, thank you.
It is.
I have a graphologist who will swear... that this is not Dr. Hassiem's signature.
We have three police graphologists who will swear that it is.
Only three?
You see, Dr. Hassiem found... that the abrasions on the prisoner's neck were... Oh, yes.
"Were not made by rope, but chains. "
Objection! Where is the witness for this assertion, Your Worship?
Dr. Hassiem is my witness.
You know that Dr. Hassiem is not available to testify.
I am also aware that he can be summoned by Your Worship to this courtroom.
And he will be accompanied by armed guards... then chained, neck, hand, and foot... and all in a matter of minutes.
I'm afraid we cannot dismiss acts of treason just when we like, Mr. McKenzie.
Are you at all concerned, Your Worship, that he might be carrying... some explosive charges in one of the recesses of his body... with the intention of blowing this entire courtroom to smithereens?
Mr. McKenzie, I must caution you as to your remarks.
I am warning you, this court will not tolerate contemptuous fripperies.
Contestants and spectators are reminded that the track meet will begin in 15 minutes.
Contestants should be preparing and suiting up in the locker room number 4.
Spectators are invited to proceed to the track and field area.
Come on.
Come on, you want to do it, don't you?
Are you kidding? Sure, I do.
You know Marty. Game for anything.
You have done it before, haven't you?
What do you think you got here?
Some little virgin?
Me, I'm a sex machine.
She's got him hooked. It's working.
All right. Let's go!
I can't go in there.
Sure, you can.
The track meet's just starting.
Who's gonna see us?
Some other time.
Oh, come on, now.
Lover boy's not frightened, is he?
What would all the guys think?
It's not that, Carol.
It's just I don't want you to get into trouble.
Oh, come on.
Come on. Come on, that's it.
Come on.
You get undressed in there.
What about you, Carol?
Where are you...
Where am I what?
Where are you gonna un...
No, listen.
Nobody's gonna hear about this from me, you know.
That doesn't mean...
I mean, if you want to tell some of your friends, that's fine by me.
Don't worry, they'll find out all about Marty Rantzen.
Now, get in there!
You got it.
- By the way, just one thing.
- What's that?
You won't forget to take your hands out of your pockets?
Quiet now.
Quick, get in there!
Oh, my God. Don't panic. Keep calm.
Hi, Susan.
Are you coming to the meet?
Oh, no. Those sports jocks bore me.
But Frank's throwing the javelin.
Aren't you gonna watch it?
Do me a favor, will you?
Okay, no big deal.
I'll be seeing you.
Bye.
Hey, what's going on?
Ever tried it under the shower before?
You know, Carol, this is an experience
I'm never gonna forget.
You won't.
How do you want it? Hot or cold?
In what?
The shower.
Come on, how'd you have it last time?
How does lukewarm grab ya?
You kids.
God damn it!
What's the matter?
I can't undo the fastener on my bra.
You want me to help?
Oh, no.
No, it's okay.
Hurry up, sex machine.
I'm wet all over.
Thank you, God.
You know, Carol, this is the best birthday
I've ever had.
April 1st is your birthday?
That's right.
Are you ready?
Just about.
Here's Marty!
April fools!
Where's the beef?
Where's the beef?
April fools!
Hi, you're on Candid Camera.
Hey, Coach.
They be fooling about in the girls' locker room.
Yeah, so what else is new?
Man, they got a lot of guys in there with them.
Guys?
- Yeah.
- Boys?
Shove that sucker's head down.
Yeah!
What the hell's going on in here?
Just having a little fun, Coach.
Which one of you heroes thought that this was gonna be fun?
We kind of decided together.
A team decision?
Hey, what have we here?
Come here.
It's the joker.
And team captain Skippy Pollack.
Well, you can tell the rest of the team that you've just been drafted.
I want everybody in the gym,
3:45, suited up, ready to go, and we're gonna find out what fun really is.
By the way, Rantzen, what are you doing in the girls' locker room in a state of undress?
I kind of got lost, Coach.
Yeah, well, you better get lost right now.
Come on.
3:45, in the gym.
And that goes for you, too, Stella.
That stupid dork Marty.
It's all his fucking fault.
All right, all right!
Cut the trained monkey act.
Come on, line up.
I want a lineup right here.
Come on.
Shape up, come on!
So this is the gang, huh?
How long has this motley crew been in existence, huh?
Can anybody tell me?
Come on, come on.
What do you have to do to become a member of this elite hit squad?
Be tough?
Are you tough, Frank?
- No, Coach.
- "No, Coach."
Am I tough?
- Yep.
- Yes...
- Yes, Coach.
- "Yes, Coach." Good.
The joker.
Make me laugh.
Make me laugh, Skip.
Come on, make us all laugh.
Or maybe you just have to be pretty.
Or stupid?
Now where the hell are Harrison and Putney?
Hey, lay off, guys!
Hey, Marty.
We just wanted to say...
Well, what I mean is...
Look, we're sorry about what happened back there.
We were just messing around.
- You know how it is.
- Yeah.
Things kind of got out of hand.
Yeah, well, next time
I'm about to score, cool it, will ya?
I mean, Carol really has the hots for me, you know?
- She does?
- Sure, she does.
She lives just down the block from you, doesn't she?
So you'll get another chance.
Anyway, just to show you there's no hard feelings, try this joint.
It's really good stuff, man.
Yeah, I rolled the joint with my own fair hands.
Listen, we've gotta get back to detention for being bad boys.
Guess you'll be staying late in chemistry again tonight, huh?
Yeah, I have to go make up some 2, 4, 6-trinitrotoluene.
Good luck, man.
Be seeing you!
Bye!
Just wait until he tries that dope.
All right, keep your butts down, your backs straight.
Let's see some movement!
Come on!
One! Two! One! Two!
That's very good, Joey.
And then, after that, we're gonna learn three, four, five, and six.
Congratulations, Skippy.
You're almost making me laugh.
Very nice. Keep trying, sweetheart.
Come on, come on!
Who told you to stop?
Let's see something here!
Stop daydreaming, you sex fiend.
Harrison, Putney!
Where the hell have you guys been?
Sorry we're late, Coach.
I guess we must have forgot the time.
Yeah, well, get down there and give me 20.
Which arm?
Your right one, wise guy.
You're now on 60.
You want to try for 120?
Hey, Coach!
Somebody threw a brick through the window!
I could have been scarred for life!
Will you cut out the dramatics?
Go find out who did this.
Yes, sir. Right away, Coach.
Come on, get a move on, Pollack!
Hey, come on, the rest of you.
What is this, National
Sit On Your Duff Week?
And keep your elbows in at your sides, Shirl.
That's it. Breathe out as you curl up.
Now, breathe in as you let it down.
Keep it in... Don't move the elbows.
Keep them in...
- Pollack!
- Yeah?
Don't "yeah" me.
Yeah, Coach?
Did you catch the guy that did it?
By the time I got there,
I was so tired, Coach, I lost him.
Sorry.
That is pa... pathetic, Pollack.
I'm sorry, Marty. We didn't mean to.
Hello?
That you, Carol?
Hi, Manny.
What do you want now?
Carol, baby, I just called you to say good morning and have a good day, you know.
Yeah, well, you have a good day, too.
Now what do you want?
You know what I want.
Are you gonna do this picture or not?
I've got to know, because the guy wants an answer this afternoon.
- I'm not doing it.
- You're not?
Tell me why the hell not!
What about my percentage?
Look, Manny.
The guy's weird, the story's weird, and...
- And what?
- And you're weird.
Listen to me.
You take your clothes off for the photographers every day of the week.
What's the difference?
The difference is that guy should be locked up.
He has been.
Now listen, kid. It's a big break for you.
"Break"? Do me a favor.
Don't give me any more breaks like this one.
Hey, baby. Be nice to me.
Who's a pretty boy, then?
Who's a pretty what?
Who's a pretty boy?
Hey, I take it all back.
You'll go far in this business.
I was talking to the dog, Manny.
I'm not doing that picture.
You know how many big names started off this way?
I could tell you.
Hundreds, thousands already.
I said forget it, Manny.
You know what?
I'd rather go to my crummy class reunion than do that picture.
And that's final.
Why, you ungrateful bitch.
Hey! Don't do that!
You almost frightened me to death!
- Where have you been all night?
- With Ricky.
Yeah? I was worried about you.
Guess what.
What?
We're engaged!
Wow!
That's fantastic.
Is that the ring?
God, it's so beautiful.
I've got to meet Ricky's parents tonight.
I thought you were gonna make it to the reunion.
Damn, I forgot all about it.
But, hey, listen.
They're only in town for a couple of hours.
- I'll get away early.
- We'll see.
No, I'll make it! Whatever.
Maybe a little late, but I'll make it, okay?
Okay.
It should be fun.
Besides, what have we got to lose?
D.O.D., Radio Doddsville.
Radio Doddsville. All right.
- Doddsville High, here I come.
- But first, the bad news.
Local weather conditions are going to be changeable, so it seems like it's going to be a cold and wet vacation weekend, and maybe some sleet and thunderstorms.
Aw, shit.
The good news, Radio Doddsville will be with you all the way.
And April Fool's Day is on its way, too, so here's your favorite, Barry Manilow.
Barry fucking Manilow?
You gotta be kidding me.
Taxi, lady?
Skip!
It's great to see you!
Hey, easy, baby.
I got my image to think about.
Your image? In this crate?
Boy, I'm glad you came by.
I thought I was gonna have to walk all the way from the 7-Eleven back there.
Well, you're lucky I decided to take the scenic route.
Yeah. Silly me decides to hitch it.
You know, see America the beautiful?
So, this thing gonna get us there?
Don't you worry.
Old Skip and his faithful warhorse will get you there without a hitch.
Oh, shit!
Where'd you get this old jalopy, anyway?
Do not insult Doris.
She's very sensitive.
I guess the rubber band finally broke.
Oh, shit!
Fuck you, asshole!
Why don't you get this heap of shit off the road?
Joey!
Skip. It's great to see you, man.
- How you doing, Joe?
- Yeah!
Put her there, pal!
Yes! Stella!
So you finally went and made and honest woman of her, huh, Bone-crusher?
Yeah, you gotta call me
"Mrs. Bone-crusher" these days.
Was that Carol?
Who else?
Miss "Most Likely to Succeed" has finally made it.
Looks like you got a problem here, old buddy.
Yeah. Think you can fix it?
No sweat.
That one's on me, Hanson.
Carol, Ted! Great to see you!
Kissy, kissy, Shirl!
Carl. Where you been keeping yourself?
Law school. What you been up to?
You know, this and that.
Hey, but shouldn't we be inside?
Class is about to begin.
The door's locked.
It can't be. We got the right date.
Try for yourself.
Are we the only ones?
Looks that way.
Can't see shit inside.
This place is the pits, man.
Yeah, nothing changes.
For Christ's sakes, Frank.
What are you trying to do, kill us?
Oh, man. That bike has got to go.
You're past it, Frank.
Over the hill.
"Over the hill"? Bullshit.
Frank, are you okay?
Sure, Stella.
How you been keeping, big boy?
Hey, whoa, there.
Let me breathe.
Who's got the beers?
Same old Frankie.
Where the hell is everybody?
This someone's idea of a cute joke?
Hey, don't look at me.
I don't know who sent out the invitations.
Well, is anybody else coming?
It's not gonna be much of a party.
I vote we go back to town and swap a few stories.
No way, man.
I'm going inside.
Who's coming with me?
Hey, I will.
Joe! I am freezing my butt off!
I won't be long, honey, okay?
Come on, Joe.
We'll go around the back way.
We'll find a way in.
It's a waste of time.
Carol, lighten up.
It'll be fun!
Oh, sure.
There's a window over there.
Yeah. Let's take a look.
Aw, shit!
What?
Dog shit.
Shut up.
Hey, Skip, did you hear something?
Where?
Over there, in the bushes.
No. It was nothing.
Come on.
I sure heard something.
Give me a boost.
All right. Ready?
One, two, three. Hike.
Yeah.
Try that top window.
Cheer up, girls.
There's some extra beer left.
Do me a favor, Ted.
I'm gonna go back to town and call Susan.
I'll join ya, darling.
Sounds like they got in.
They'll never get in.
That whole place is locked up.
Shit.
Looks like rain.
Joe!
Are you in there?
You jerk!
Who'd you think I was?
Jason?
April Fools!
April Fools doesn't start until midnight, smart-ass.
Hey, someone's been fucking around in here.
It looks like we've been set up.
Or it's Skip's weird idea of a joke.
Come on, you guys.
I had nothing to do with it.
Cobwebs.
You gotta be kidding.
You're sick, man.
For Christ's sakes.
Okay, I did it.
I set this whole thing up just to waste your time.
Satisfied?
Come on, I'm leaving.
I'm with you, Carol.
Yeah, this place gives me the creeps.
Let's go find our old classrooms.
Should be fun.
Yeah, there's a good idea.
We'll wait for the storm to go by.
Aw, what the hell?
Yeah, why not?
Jesus, looks like Halloween.
Hey, Skip, this is really great.
Yeah, you should be shot and put away.
I'm only staying five minutes.
Somebody turn the lights on!
Holy shit.
This is weird.
Reminds me of prom night, doesn't it, Joe?
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Just before I passed out.
It's spooky.
Hey, we got food and drink and everything.
Must have set you back a fortune, Skip.
Yeah, well, you know, I do try.
Come on, you guys. Let's party!
Hey, aren't those our lockers?
Somebody must have moved them in here.
And there's my name scratched on it.
I got my ass kicked for that.
Look, my gloves.
I'd lost them on prom night.
That's not the only thing she lost.
My calculator.
That went missing, too.
And you only just noticed it?
What the hell are these doing here?
- They yours?
- They were.
Still smell the same.
- There you go, Skip.
- Oh, man.
You were always borrowing them from me, anyway.
This time, you can keep them.
You sure you didn't have anything to do with this?
This your idea of a joke?
Cut it out, Carol.
Hey, isn't that Marty's locker?
Marty.
You think we should take a look inside?
You want to?
No way.
I'll do it.
Now, look, I had nothing to do with that.
Marty's yearbook.
Oh, God.
Open it.
Guess the little sucker never got it.
Boy, would you look at Joey?
He never collected that prize, did he?
No, they took him straight to the hospital.
He had six months of plastic surgery.
- Did he recover?
- No.
Not all the skin grafts took.
When they finished with him, he still looked a real mess.
Not that it mattered much, anyhow.
The doctor said he'd never be fit for human company again.
His mind went berserk.
He flipped out real bad.
No shit?
Yeah.
Don't you realize that we... we turned him from a nice little guy into a crazed lunatic?
And you know what?
They say he still roams the nuthouse, ever hopeful of that chance to escape, escape back to his old school so he can take his evil revenge out on us all.
You're really not that funny at all, bird brain.
Come on, relax.
Last I heard of Marty, he'd joined IBM.
He's forgotten about us, believe me.
Okay, but, just stop fooling around, huh?
You're getting to be a pain in the ass.
Yeah.
All right, all right.
Hey look, I don't know about you guys, but I'm drinking some beer.
Sounds all right to me.
Good shit, man.
You want it, too?
Hey, that stuff costs.
Yeah, but it's better than grass.
Jesus, 11:30.
Time flies when you're high, man.
Skip, I want to go pee.
So?
So it's creepy out there.
I want someone to go with me.
Don't look at me. Remember?
No boys in the girls' locker room.
I'll go with you.
And watch out for the boogeyman, girls.
I'm going to explode.
You bastards! I wet myself!
You morons!
When the hell are you gonna grow up?
Hey, dry off fast, girls!
What the hell do you kids think you're doing?
Don't you know you're trespassing?
Hey, man, don't do that.
You nearly gave me a coronary.
It's old Digby.
You used to be the janitor here.
I am the caretaker now.
What's the difference?
Well, the caretaker's a man who takes care of a place.
The janitor, he...
Janits it.
Now, don't you get smart with me, boy.
Hey, say, don't I know you from somewhere?
Yeah, sure.
You remember me.
Skip Pollack.
Pollack? Can't say I do.
But what are you kids doing here, anyway?
This place has been closed now for nearly five years.
Five years?
Pollack. Hey, I remember you.
Yeah.
Boy, you was a pain in the ass.
And I thought I was one hell of a guy.
Well, you ain't changed much.
By the way, they're knocking down this old place here next month, so if you want to have a last look around, that's all right by me.
But just you don't go and start no fires.
Okay, man. Relax.
Hey, have a beer.
Enjoy yourself.
Thank you, thank you.
Well, I guess an old caretaker's gotta take care of himself, too.
- Good night.
- Okay, boys.
Good night.
Ah, yes. I'll be heading out before midnight.
Yes, sir. Oh, yeah.
Goddamn kids.
Hey, I thought I told you kids
I don't want no trouble.
Hey, Skip.
Want to earn ten bucks?
Nance, you can have me for free.
See this quarter?
All you gotta do is drop it off your head into this funnel, twice.
You gotta be kidding.
It's not as easy as it looks.
It'll be a cinch.
Now, lean back real far and close your eyes.
That's it.
Now, when I say go, you lean forward slowly and drop it right in the funnel.
- Okay.
- Go.
- Yes! Ten bucks!
- Wow!
You ain't got nothing down there, Skip.
How could you miss?
You gotta do it twice, dummy.
All right, all right.
Give me the quarter.
Go!
Hey!
The little boy wet his panties.
It's after midnight.
What are you talking about?
It's April Fool's Day.
Or can't you take a joke, Skip?
Yeah, I can take a joke.
Give me a beer.
Hey, Ted.
Show us how you sink a beer.
I'll show you.
You're past it, Frank.
Let Ted do it.
Ted's full of shit.
Atta boy.
Okay.
Five, four, three two, one!
You want to pound down this?
Are you okay?
I feel sick!
I can't get the door open!
Try the window!
- Oh, shoot.
- Is she all right?
She'll be okay.
What's happened to Shirley?
She's still up there.
Want to go for her?
You ain't gonna get me back up there.
No way!
All right, well, we stick together.
There's gotta be a way out.
Shit!
The whole goddamn place is locked tight.
Well, one of us has got to do something!
All right. Just hold your water!
Let me try it.
Keep going, Carl! Kick it, man!
Come on, Putney!
Be careful!
Who's got the fastest car?
Carol does.
Give me the keys.
Here, she always starts first time.
Just get in and drive like hell!
Shit.
What the hell is he doing?
I can't see!
I thought you said she started every time!
Every time except now.
He's done it!
What the hell's he doing?
He's turning around!
Get back! Go for help!
No!
Come on, let's go find her.
I'll stay with Nancy!
Oh, my God!
Marty's come back!
No, that's crazy.
What happened to Marty was an accident.
It wasn't our fault!
Of course it was!
And Marty knows it!
I'm scared, Frank!
It's... It's all right, baby.
I'm here.
Susan!
Susan, go back!
Skip! Frank!
Hey, you guys, stop fooling around!
This isn't funny!
Hello?
Is anybody there?
Skip!
Frank!
Marty?
Marty Rantzen?
Shirley's dead.
- Dead?
- You don't want to see it.
Oh, Christ.
I saw Susan.
Susan?
- Susan?
- She's out there.
Isn't that her car?
If Susan's out there, then... then so is he.
What are we gonna do, Frank?
What the fuck are we gonna do?
Joe said he saw a tractor, when you came in.
I've got an idea.
A tractor?
There it is.
Do you think it'll bust through these doors?
There's only one way to find out.
You're never gonna bust out of here in this piece of shit.
You gotta be kidding me.
- You got any better ideas?
- No.
Then button it!
Think you can start it, Joe?
If the engine ain't seized up, it's got a chance.
Hey, oil! Good stuff.
And gas.
About a half a gallon.
Well, how far's that gonna get us?
Ten, 12 miles.
Unless you want to cut grass.
Hey, never you mind how far.
You just open those doors, and everybody'll look after their own ass, all right?
Anything we can do?
No. Just let me do what I know best.
So why don't you take care of Stella and the girls, huh?
Okay. How long you gonna be?
Maybe an hour.
Maybe more.
I'll call when I'm finished.
Call?
You do more than call, Joe.
You holler loud and clear.
You understand me?
Loud and clear.
Frank.
I wish things could have turned out different.
How do you mean?
With Joe and me.
I don't follow.
Sometimes, I just wish it would have been you and me.
Come on, Stella.
Joe's a good guy.
Sure, Joe's good.
And I'm bad.
He takes care of me, but only after he's taken care of his goddamn truck.
It wouldn't be right.
Not with you and the kid and all that.
It could have just as easily been a little Frank.
I don't get you.
You're his father, Frank.
What?
You can't have forgotten.
The summer of '80?
June 23rd? 2:30?
Yes. Sure!
Why didn't you tell me?
I tried, Frank. I tried.
But you weren't around.
And then Joe came along, and it seemed so much easier just to...
Jesus!
I want to go to bed with you, Frank.
Now?
What about Joe?
Joe? Joe's busy.
He's still fixing his goddamn machines.
That's not what I meant.
Come on, baby. We've got time.
Well, say Joe came back.
Joe won't come back.
It's okay.
What do you think I've got to offer you?
I ain't no hero no more.
Frank.
I'm in the home stretch.
Hey, pass me the wrench, will you, Frank?
Thanks.
Oh, shit.
Don't mess with that. Don't...
Aw, shit.
What the fuck do you think you're doing, Frank?
Get this thing off me!
Crazy son of a bitch!
Get this fucking thing off me!
No.
No.
This never happened to me before.
I thought this sensi shit is supposed to get you real hot.
Hey, Frank, the Surgeon General's right.
This stuff does damage your health.
Lay off, will you?
Ease up, Frank.
You're supposed to enjoy it.
Say, you ain't turned gay on us, have you?
Come here.
Where's Frank and Stella?
While the cat's away...
They can't be.
At a time like this?
What about Joe?
He's fixing the tractor.
Come on, don't stop now.
I can't.
I can't.
Talk dirty, Frank.
- Talk dirty.
- Fuck. Tits.
Dirty, dirty.
Fuck.
Tits, screw.
Aw, shit!
I should have kept my leathers on.
Don't stop now, Frank.
Don't stop now.
I'm coming, Frank.
I'm coming!
Jesus Christ.
Stella must've really needed that.
Has anybody checked Joe?
Joe's dead.
Get upstairs, quick.
Let's stick together.
Oh, my God.
You bastard!
You filthy, stinking bastard, Marty!
What do you want from us?
Come out and show yourself, you little prick!
You hear me, Marty?
Come out and show yourself!
I'll get you for this, Rantzen.
You fucking little asshole,
I'll get you for this!
Come out, you ugly son of a bitch!
You hear me? Come out!
What do we do now?
We wait.
Wait? What for?
Marty's got to show himself sooner or later.
All we do is put our backs to the wall and wait for him.
Nancy, listen.
It's dawn.
April Fool's Day ends at noon.
Marty won't hurt us after midday, I'm sure of it.
You're sure.
Well, that's great.
If it hadn't been for you and your stupid jokes, we wouldn't be here.
Cool it, Nancy. It's not Skip's fault.
If you hadn't taken Marty into the showers, none of this would have happened.
It's you two he's after, nobody else.
Stella, Frank, Joe... none of them should have died.
It should have been you two.
You both should be dead!
Hey. Come on.
We'll get out of here.
We will.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
All we have to do is stay awake.
It'll be a cinch.
Where's Skip?
I don't know.
I fell asleep.
I'm going to look for him.
No. It's safer here.
It's past 11:00.
So?
April Fool's ends at noon.
If we can last out one more hour, we're safe.
I don't know.
Marty's stuck to the rules so far.
We've got to find Skip.
Are you going to come?
You're not getting me out there. No way.
Suit yourself.
Hey!
Wait for me!
I don't understand it!
They're gone.
I never meant to hurt Marty.
Please, let me go home.
Please, let me go home.
Shut up!
We got to find Skip, then we can go home.
Promise?
I promise.
Careful, now.
Oh, no.
Marty's yearbook.
What the hell is going on in here?
Just having a little fun...
My picture.
He's going to get me next.
Nancy? Nancy!
Nancy, come back!
Don't be stupid! Nancy!
No!
No!
No. Please, no!
Please! No!
No!
Please!
Oh, God!
Skip!
No!
Marty!
How do you want it?
Please, stop. No!
- Hot or cold?
- No! No!
Marty, no! Please stop... No!
I showed you!
April fool!
April fucking fool, you motherfuckers!
I showed you! Me, Marty Rantzen!
Oh, Marty!
Marty.
Marty.
You're dead meat, Marty.
Can't you take a joke, Marty?
Smoke this, Marty.
Hot or cold, Marty?
Remember me, wuss?
Show us your stuff, Marty.
You're all alone, Marty.
Relax, Marty.
The plastic surgeons have done a great job.
You'll be able to take off the bandages in a couple weeks.
How can anybody...
How can anybody see if I don't?
Nurse?
Nurse, everything okay?
Go! Get off!
How can anybody...
How can anybody see if I don't?
I'll get you!

They still hate you.
They still hate you.
You can put your arms down when the search team finishes with you.
We don't want anybody from this fort going into Tynin looking for rednecks.
- May I speak, sir?
- Cobb?
Nivens must know nobody colored killed the sarge.
Well, this is precautionary, Cobb.
We can't have the Army engaged in revenge on civilians.
Sir. Are there any suspects, sir?
None.
Oh, come on, now. Everybody knows it was the Klan.
Were you an eyewitness, soldier?
They lynched Jefferson the week I got here.
Two weeks after that, it was...
Henson.
Unless you saw it, keep your opinions to yourself.
Yes, sir.
And that applies to everybody else.
Yes, sir.
Tynin has been placed off-limits to all enlisted personnel.
Oh, come on, captain.
Any man found in the town will be immediately subject to court-martial.
Sergeant Waters' replacement will be assigned in a couple of weeks.
Until then, Cobb, you're barracks NCO.
Any questions?
Carry on.
Now, what you think?
Taylor and that goddamn colonel, they know who killed Waters.
Anybody feel like playing me in some pitty-pat?
I thought all you could play was flunky.
Yeah.
Wilkie, whose ass you gonna kiss now that your number one ass is dead?
You know what you can do for me, Henson.
You too, Peterson.
Take it easy.
I'm the one who lost three stripes.
I'm the only man here with kids.
When the man said jump, I jumped.
Come on, don't put your wife and kids between you and Waters' ass.
I don't kiss nobody's ass, Henson.
I just wanted my stripes back.
Never been no place, never had nothing.
You can't understand a man like me.
I was a top sergeant of this platoon.
Yeah? Well, now you ain't nothing.
Nothing, Wilkie.
- Recruits, over here.
- Let me see your passes.
Let's go. Let's go.
Hey, wake up. Wake up, boy.
You said Tynin, didn't you?
Yeah, yeah. Ahem. Yeah.
Come on, boy.
Let's go.
- Hang on.
- Here we go again.
I'm from Mississippi.
Captain Davenport?
Corporal Ellis at your disposal, sir.
I'm to take you to Colonel Nivens, sir.
Well, let's get rolling, soldier.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, Captain Davenport.
Yes, sir.
We're rolling, captain.
This is where they killed
Sergeant Waters last month, sir.
Why did you say "they" killed him, corporal?
- Who's "they"?
- The Klan, sir.
They ain't too crazy about us tan yanks down here.
I suppose whoever drove you in from the station showed you the spot where the killing took place.
Told you I had all the troops' personal effects searched for weapons.
He tell you all that?
Is there a point the colonel is trying to make, sir?
There's a point.
This thing has been blown all the hell out of shape.
This is the Army's business.
Not the NAACP.
Not the Negro press.
Not those paper-shuffling desk jockeys in Washington.
I was brought up in the South, Davenport.
Ever hear of
Threadgill County, Alabama?
No, sir.
No matter.
I've been commanding colored troops all my life, Davenport.
The worst thing you can do in this part of the country is pay attention to death of a Negro under mysterious circumstances.
Especially a soldier.
People get itchy. Uneasy.
White folk in the town, colored at the fort.
Keep turning this thing over, sooner or later, you're bound to have an explosion.
Now, I've lived here in Hunter Parish three years.
I'm fond of the place.
I like the duty.
You get my meaning?
What is it you want, colonel?
I want whatever you came here to do completed in three days.
Sir, I request permission to notify Washington.
Denied.
I'm under direct orders...
I don't give a damn if Roosevelt sent you.
I'm trying to prevent my troops from going into town and killing somebody.
And I don't care what you think.
You can always return to Washington.
No, sir.
I was assigned this case and I intend to file a report, sir.
Here are your instructions and our reports.
Taylor's men will help you get settled.
Taylor was Waters' CO.
That'll be all, Davenport.
Oh, and, captain?
Remember, you're the first colored officer most of these men have seen.
The Army expects you to set an example for the colored troops and be a credit to your race.
Is that clear, captain?
Yes, colonel.
Sir.
Sir, you all right?
You like to go to your quarters?
No, I'll see Captain Taylor.
You don't wanna unpack, sir?
Freshen up? Didn't go too good?
You got a hearing problem?
No, sir. I was born with big ears.
It runs in my family.
My grandmother had big ears...
I used to drive a fire truck, captain.
Then the Army took and let me drive an ambulance.
I've been driving this jeep for six months, sir.
Only turned over twice.
- Twice?
- Yes, sir.
Good.
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon, sir.
Sergeant Washington, sir.
Can I help you, captain?
Captain Davenport to see Captain Taylor.
Just a moment, sir.
Yes?
There's a Captain Davenport to see you, sir.
- Well, send him in.
- Yes, sir.
Every member of the lodge is rooting for you, sir.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.
I like your flowers, captain.
Hey, where's he from?
He's from Washington, D.C.
He's here on special assignment.
Washington?
Yes, sir.
You gotta be shitting me.
So they assigned a lawyer to the military police, eh?
Well, where did you graduate law school?
Howard University.
Your parents rich or something?
No, my father's a mailman.
I graduated at the Point.
I didn't see any Negroes at the Point.
In fact, I never saw a Negro until I was, I think, 12 or 13.
Have you seen my orders, captain?
Yes, as soon as Colonel
Nivens received them.
Look, I think it only fair to tell you that had I known you'd be a Negro
I would've requested the immediate suspension of the investigation.
Now, look, may I speak freely?
You haven't stopped yet.
Look, these local people aren't gonna charge a white man in this parish on your say-so.
And Nivens knows that.
He doesn't give a damn about this killing.
Your being here proves it.
Making a fool out of you. Can't you...?
Will you take off those sunglasses?
I like these.
They're like MacArthur's.
All right. Now, look. Let me explain something to you.
You go near Tynin in uniform, sounding white and charging local people, you're gonna wind up just as dead as Waters.
This isn't Washington, Davenport.
I know where I am.
Do you know how many times I've asked
Nivens to look into this killing?
Every day since it happened.
Do you suspect someone?
Don't play lawyer with me, soldier.
With you on this case, we are not gonna get anywhere.
Like it or not, captain.
I am all you've got.
Your orders instruct you to cooperate.
Now, is there anything else?
- Ellis.
- Yes, sir.
Captain Davenport will need some assistance with the men.
You'll excuse me, captain?
Oh, I'm glad I met you.
Captain.
I sure hope we get to fight soon, sir.
Next, they'll have us picking this year's cotton crop.
Don't worry, they don't grow a lot of cotton in Germany.
Yes, sir.
How long was Captain Taylor's investigation?
Two days, sir.
Two days? Who did he question?
Well, mostly guys who had contact with sarge that day.
Guys in his platoon, then anybody who could've seen him on the road.
Wasn't but a handful.
- Did you see him that day?
- Nope.
No, sir.
Did your sergeant drink a lot?
I didn't know him well enough, sir.
All right, soldiers, let's get back to those exercises.
Haven't you ever seen a colored officer before?
No, sir. Have you, sir?
Ten-hut.
This is it, sir.
The captain instructed everyone in the sergeant's platoon to be here.
As you were.
Sergeant Waters' room is right there, sir.
Sir, I think I ought to tell you, sir.
Captain Taylor questioned two white officers from this fort that night.
How do you know?
I delivered his report to Colonel Nivens, sir.
And on the way over, the jeep hit a hole, bam!
And the papers flew all over the road and I happened to notice it, sir.
Who are they?
No names, sir.
Just the mentioning of the questioning.
Seems they were on the road that night.
Well, don't let any more reports fly away from you, corporal.
No, sir.
Sir, may I say something, though?
It sure is good seeing one of us wearing captain's bars, sir.
Call in the first man, corporal.
Yes, sir.
Private Wilkie, captain wants to see you.
Yes, indeedy. On my way.
Private Wilkie reports as ordered, sir.
Close the door.
- Have a seat.
- Yes, sir.
I'm Captain Davenport. I'm conduc...
We all know that, sir.
Word went out on the grapevine you were here the minute you hit the fort.
I'm conducting an inquiry into the events surrounding the death of Waters.
The report I file will be confidential.
How long did you know the sergeant?
About a year, sir.
You see, this company, sir, was basically a baseball team.
Most of the guys had played in the Negro league.
Naturally, the Army put us all together.
The Army sent Sergeant Waters here to manage the team, summer of '42, right after the invasion of North Africa.
He'd been in field artillery, a gunnery sergeant.
He had a FEF and an ETO.
A Croix de Guerre from the First World War.
What kind of man was he?
He was all spit and polish, sir.
He took my stripes, sir, but I was in the wrong.
Sergeant Wilkie.
You're a noncommissioned officer in the army of a country at war.
Penalty for being drunk on duty is severe in peace time.
So don't bring me, "Us colored folks can't do nothing unless they're drunk."
You're supposed to be an example.
I'm gonna put you in the stockade for 10 days and take those stripes.
Wait, sergeant...
To teach you a lesson.
You're in the Army.
Colored folks running off at the mouth.
What will they do if the white man give them a chance? What do you do?
You wind up drunk on guard duty.
I don't blame the white man.
Why the hell should he put colored and white together?
You can't guard your own quarters.
Sergeant...
Where's your pride, soldier? Where's your respect for this uniform?
Get out of my sight, private.
And how was he with the other men?
Sometimes the Southern guys caught hell.
Sergeant wasn't too big on guys from the South.
Me, I'm from Detroit.
Did you know that Joe Louis got his start in Detroit?
What about the Southern men?
The sarge didn't like them.
Except for C.J.
It could've been because C.J. was the best ballplayer on the team.
He could sing too.
Boy, could he sing.

Drink up. Drink up, y'all.
Drink up. Mary can't make no money when the U.S.
Army stops sipping.
So drink up now because I need a new car.
Yeah.
I'm gonna ask that boy something. Come on, Wilkie.
Hey, boy.
You ever heard of Blind Willie Reynolds?
From Son House?
I knew it.
I bet you're from
Mississippi too, ain't you?
Yes, sir.
I used to hear him at the Bandana
Club outside Camp J.J. Reilly.
Folks used to come from everywhere, Wilkie.
Folks would be dancing, sweating.
Reminded me of a place
I used to go in France.
The whiskey, the women.
Place called the Café Napoléon.
Where did you learn to play, son?
My daddy taught me, sarge.
You play pretty good, boy.
Wilkie, wasn't that good?
Yeah, that was good, sarge.
Take it easy, son.
I mostly agreed with the sergeant, sir.
He was a good man.
Good to his men.
Talked about his wife and his kid all the time.
As a matter of fact, he wrote home to his wife every day.
I just don't see why anybody would wanna kill the sarge.

See this?
My wife let a neighbor take this just a couple of weeks ago.
Army's not for my son.
See, when this war is over, things are gonna change.
I want him to be ready for it.
I'll send him to some big white college.
Let him rub elbows with the whites.
Learn white man's language, how he does things.
White don't rub off.
Well, what are we gonna do?
Stay behind in everything?
Hell, you can see it in the Army
. White man's running rings around us.
Lot of us ain't had the chance them white boys had, sarge.
Oh, that ain't no excuse.
My daddy shoveled coal from a wagon all his life.
Couldn't read or write, but he saw that we did.
Now, not having is no excuse for not getting.
You can't get pee from a tree, sarge.
You're just like the rest of them,
Wilkie.
Ignorant, scared.
- Stop thinking like a nigger.
- Take it easy.
All I said...
Is the equipment ready?
No.
Then see that it gets ready.

Two people, sir.
Mr. Warm and Mr. Cold.
But deep down, a real nice guy.
You could borrow a 10 from him if you needed it.
Did you see him the night he was killed?
I saw him in town at the club earlier.
But I left around 10:00.
He was juicing pretty heavy.
Is it true that when they found him his stripes and insignia were still on the uniform?
Yes.
Something's wrong, ain't it, sir?
Those Klan boys, they can't stand to see us in these uniforms.
They usually take the stripes and stuff off before they lynch us.
That'll be all, private.
Yes, sir.
Can you do anything about allotment checks?
My wife didn't get hers last month.
Did you see the finance officer?
Yes, I did, sir.
Well, I'll speak to Captain Taylor about it.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Yes, indeed.
Would you like me to send the next man in?
Yes.
Private First Class Melvin Peterson, reporting as ordered, sir.
Sit down, private.
Where are you from, Peterson?
Hollywood, California.
By way of Alabama, sir.
You see, I enlisted in '42. I thought we'd get a chance to fight, sir.
Did you know the sergeant well?
No. He was with the company when I got assigned, and PFCs and sergeants, we don't mix too well, sir.
You played ball for him.
Oh, yes, sir. I played shortstop.
And did you like the sergeant?
No, sir.
Well, it goes back to the team.
Stoneass felt that...
Stoneass?
I'm the only one who called him that. Sergeant Waters.
Didn't mean no offense, sir.
By the time I got here, the team had won nine or 10 games in a row.
There was even a rumor we'd get to play the Yankees in exhibition.
Anyway, we were...
We were playing the 35th
Ordinance this particular day.
It was a real big game too.
The YWCA sent a whole busload of women to see us.
Yes, a real big day, sir.
I can't believe that.
Yeah.
Let it fly again. Let's go, Pete.
Come on, batter. Hit the ball.
That's a hell of a ballplayer.
Come on, hit it.
Throw another one up here.
Come on, C.J., next county.
Hell of a ballplayer.
Did you see...?
- All right, C.J.
- Right on, C.J.
Come on, boy.
Did you see that ball?
Did you see it? Did you see it go?
We played fairly well. I had two hits.
Smalls had a couple and C.J...
C.J. was incredible.
And we beat them something like nine-, 10-nothing.
Like we always did after, we went over to the mess hall to celebrate.
Fellas.
It's a big ball, give it back.
C.J. Who was that fine river hip thing you was talking to before the game?
The woman had tits like two helmets.
You see the size of them knockers?
No, he didn't.
Smalls couldn't even see a ball go in his glove.
How the hell he gonna see C.J.?
I saw C.J., man.
Will you all let C.J. tell me about this woman?
She looked mighty good to me, C.J.
All she asked me for was my autograph.
She looked like she was asking for more than that.
Moved in close.
Breathing heavy.
Waving them tits all in your face.
He's right on that, C.J.
If I'd given that gal what she asked me for, she'd give me something
I didn't want.
Around home, there's a fella folks used to call
Little Jimmy One-Leg on account of his thing was so big.
A couple of years ago, a young, pretty thing laid clap on Jimmy so bad he lost the one good leg he had.
Now folks just call him Little.
You know, that pretty young thing talking to me ain't look too clean.
Yeah, them dirty ones will give you the clap every time, right, Henson?
I hear tell they're on the verge of getting all of us together.
The colored, the white, say they want one army.
You can forget that, C.J.
White folks ain't never gonna integrate no army.
I don't know. If they do,
I'm gonna be ready for them.

Knock it off. We don't need no more of that guitar-picking, sitting-around-the-shack music today, C.J.
I want all you out of those baseball uniforms and into work clothes.
You'll report to me at 1600.
We got a work detail, painting the lobby of the Officers' Club.
Why can't those officers paint their own club?
Hell, no, Smalls.
Let the Great Colored
Cleanup Company do it.
Our motto is, "Anything you don't wanna do", the colored troops will do for you."
♪ Anything you don't wanna do
The colored troops will do for you ♪
♪ Anything you don't wanna do
The colored troops will do for you ♪
♪ Anything you don't wanna do
The colored troops will do for you ♪ ♪
That's enough.
Let me tell all you fancy-assed, ball-playing Negroes something.
The reasons for any orders given by a superior officer is none of y'all's business.
You obey them.
This country is at war.
And you niggers are soldiers, nothing else.
And something else.
From now on, when I tell you to do something, I want it done.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
Now get out of those baseball uniforms.
I could smell you suckers before I hit the door.
Hey, what kind of colored man are you?
I'm a soldier, Peterson.
And the kind of colored man that don't like lazy, shiftless Negroes.
Well, sir, you ain't got to come in here calling us names.
The Nazis call you schwarze.
You gonna complain to Hitler he hurt your feelings?
Don't look like to me we could do too much to them Nazis with paintbrushes, sarge.
You trying to mock me, C.J.?
- No, sir, sarge.
- Good.
Because whatever an ignorant
Geechee like you has to say ain't worth paying attention to, is it?
Is it?
I reckon not, sarge.
You're a creep, Waters.
Sarge's just joking, Pete.
He don't mean no harm.
No, he does. I mean, we take enough from them white boys.
Yes, you do.
If it wasn't for Southern niggers white folks wouldn't think we was all fools.
Well, where are you from,
England?
Wilkie.
Looks like we got us a wiseass Alabama boy here.
Yes, sir.
Now, don't you get smart, nigger.
Get your fucking hands off me.
You wanna hit old Sergeant Waters, boy?
Come on.
Please.
Come on, nigger.
Ten-hut.
At ease.
- What's going on here, sergeant?
- Nothing, sir.
I was going over some batting techniques, sir.
Is there something you wanted?
Something I can do?
No, no, nothing.
I just wanted to congratulate you men on the game you won today.
Now, the way I figure it, only seven more and we'll be the first colored team in Army history to play the Yankees.
The entire regiment is counting on you.
- Sergeant?
- Sir.
As far as I'm concerned, these men can have the rest of the day off.
I beg your pardon, sir.
Excuse me, sir. These men don't need time off.
They need work. Our fellas in Africa aren't getting time off.
Besides, we have orders to report for a paint detail at 1600.
Who issued that order?
Major Harris.
- I'll speak to the major.
- Sir?
I don't think it's a good idea to have a colored NCO mixed up with your officers, sir.
I said I'd speak to him, sergeant.
Yes, sir.
Memphis, about that catch you made in center field today...
How in the hell did you get up that high?
They say I got bird in my blood, sir.
I hope it's American eagle.
No, sir. Crow.
See, a man told my daddy the day I was born.
He said, "The boy got the shadow of crow in his chest..."
That's fine, Memphis.
Men, you played a great game today.
- Sergeant?
- A-ten-hut.
Carry on.
Shadow of a crow.
- What do you say?
- Yeah, that's the...
How long a story were you gonna tell the man there, C.J.?
Peterson. I ain't forgot you, boy.
It's time to teach you a lesson.
- Wilkie.
- Sir?
Go outside and make sure everything is set up.
You want all the NCOs?
I'm going outside and wait for you, Geechee.
And when you come out,
I'm gonna whup your black Southern ass.
Let the whole company watch too.
You need to learn respect for these stripes.
The rest of you, get those goddamn uniforms off like I said.
You ain't gonna fight him, are you?
Don't do it. He'll fight dirty.
You can't whup the sarge.
Well, you wanna fight in my place, Cobb?
Shoot.
Pete. Pete, I got some farmer's dust.
Just a pinch will make you strong as a bull.
Would you get the hell out of here with that crap?
You can't speak up. You let him treat you like a dog.
Calling names ain't nothing, Pete.
I know who I is. Sarge ain't so bad.
He's been good to me.
C.J., the man despises you.
You're wrong, Pete.
Plus, I feel sorry for him myself.
Any man ain't sure where he belong gotta be in a whole lot of pain.
Look, don't you all even care about nothing?
Don't none of us like it, Pete.
But this is the Army and sarge got all the stripes.
I'll go get the captain. You ain't got to go out and get your head beaten in.
Well, somebody's got to fight him.
Waters, what's going on?
I had a problem with one of the guys.
- Yeah?
- Don't worry about it.
Come on now, boy.
Let's take your whupping like a man.
Kick his ass, Pete.
Watch him, Pete.
Yeah, come on out here and kick old sarge's ass.
Come on, Geechee.
You don't want the sarge to grow old waiting for you now.
Fight.
Fight him. Fight him. Grab him.
- Get him.
- Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Watch him, Pete.
He got him. That got him.
Come on. Get up. Get up, sarge.
You throw a pretty mean punch, boy.
But old sarge is here to kick your ass.
- Come on.
- Come on, Pete.
Move over there.
- There you go.
- Come on.
Who the hell is fighting over there?
- Come on.
- There you go.
- Get up, Pete.
- Get up, get up.
- Get him, sarge.
- Vernon. Vernon.
That's enough.
Yeah, he beat me pretty bad that day, sir.
Did anybody report the fight to an officer?
No, sir, I never reported it.
I know I should have, but he left me alone after that so I just played ball.
I appreciate your honesty,
Peterson.
Thank you, sir.
Did you see Sergeant Waters the night he was killed?
No, sir. Smalls and I had guard duty.
Thank you. That'll be all for now.
Yes, sir.
Did the team ever get to play the Yankees?
No, sir. We lost the last game to a sanitation company.
What brings you out to my neighborhood, captain?
Slumming?
I wanted you to see the request
I've sent to Colonel Nivens to have your investigation terminated.
Now, my reasons have nothing to do with you personally.
My request won't hurt your career in any way.
It's just that there are other things to consider in this case.
Only the color of my skin.
Now, hold it, Davenport.
I want the people that killed Waters prosecuted.
- So do I.
- Then give this up.
White people down here, they won't see their duty or justice.
They'll see you. And you can't possibly get at the truth.
Why? Because two white officers are involved in this?
And you can't get them charged, court-martialed or anything else.
Why wasn't there any mention of them in my report?
You think I'm gonna let you get away with this?
I was ordered not to include it.
- By who?
- Colonel Nivens.
Now, look, they took two .45-caliber slugs out of Waters, Army issue.
Now, if my men thought a white officer had killed him, there would have been a slaughter.
Who are the officers?
Lieutenant Byrd in Ordnance and a Captain Wilcox,
12th Hospital Group.
Private Seymour saw them on the road.
When I checked the officers' billet, I found them both asleep.
They admitted they'd had an argument with the sergeant... but said they'd left him on the road.
So you never believed the Klan was involved.
No. No.
Now can you see why this thing needs somebody else?
Tell me what they told you.
Look, hotshot, they're not gonna let you charge those two men.
Tell me what they told you.
Left, hup, three, four.
Left, hup, three, four.
Left, two, three, four.
You wanna move your ass off the goddamn road, sergeant?
Well, I'll be damned.
If it ain't the white boys.
Did you hear what he said?
- Shit.
- Let it go.
Let it go my ass.
Come here, sergeant.
White boys, all starched and stiff.
Want everybody to learn that symphony shit.
That's what you said in France, and, you know,
I listened to it.
Am I right, now? Am I?
You'd better straighten up and salute an officer or I'll take your fucking stripes, boy.
That's better.
Well, look at the nigger.
You come to attention right now, and that is an order.
I ain't doing nothing white folks say do. No more.
No, leave him alone, the man is drunk.
I want the nigger to do like I tell him. Do it.
- No.
- I'll teach him, goddamn it.
I always mind y'all.
Look what it's done to me.
I hate myself.
Don't blame me. God's the one who made you black, not me.
My daddy said,
"Don't talk like this," talk like that.
Don't say,
"Say..."
I even killed for you.
Stop!
You wanna kill him? The man is sick.
Let him go. You're gonna kill him.
Come on.
White men are killing for you, nigger.
Good men dying for you.
So anyway, they said they left Waters about 2310.
And everyone in the barracks confirms that they were in by 2330 and that neither man left till the following morning.
That's nothing but white officers lying to protect two of their own.
You know that.
I'm arresting both of them, captain.
Consider yourself under arrest... pending my charges against you.
What charges?
It was your duty to go over
Nivens' head if you had to.
Oh, you're gonna arrest the colonel too, Davenport?
Because he's part of their alibi.
He was there in the officers' billet when they came in.
Played poker till 3:30 in the morning, yeah.
Yeah, the colonel, Major Hines and four other white officers.
They're all lying.
You just go out and prove it.
Sir, I intend to arrest Lieutenant
Byrd and Captain Wilcox.
You will do nothing of the kind.
Colonel.
I believe these men had something to do with Sergeant Waters' death.
No, I can't allow that.
You have no authority to arrest white officers.
Then give me the authority, sir.
Colonel.
Your breakfast is ready.
Thank you, honey.
Can I have someone fetch you coffee, captain?
No, thank you, ma'am.
I hope they're making your stay at
Fort Neal real comfortable, captain.
They're taking good care of me.
It's very thoughtful of you to ask.
Good morning.
No, I can't give you that authority.
- I told you.
I was there.
Now, you've read our affidavits on this thing.
Colonel, what will the Army say when they find out white officers beat up the victim not long before he was shot to death?
Their CO refuses to report they had anything to do with it and he signs an affidavit supporting their alibi.
These two are our best suspects.
How can you not have them arrested or at least questioned by the investigating officer?
Something like this is bound to get out.
I didn't say you couldn't question them.
But I want a white officer present.
And I want everything that's said reported to me.
- Is that clear?
- Of course, sir.
You're dismissed, captain.
Yes, sir.

Hey, Virge, same old sermon?
I didn't know you were a religious man, Henson.
I'm not.
I just play this organ.
If I play on Sundays, I get out of a few work details during the week.
That's all.
I wanna talk about Sergeant Waters.
Yeah?
There ain't much to talk about, except for I didn't like the man myself on account of what he did to C.J.
What did he do?
I don't mean you no offense, but I ain't exactly crazy about talking to no officer.
Colored or white.
Oh, you're gonna talk, Henson.
You'll talk or I'll put your ass in the stockade so long you'll forget how to.
He was always on...
Always on C.J.'s back about something.
Every little thing. Least ways, that's how it seemed to me.
Then the shooting went down.
What shooting?
Well, the shooting over at
Williams' Golden Palace.
Happened just last year right at the end of the baseball season.
A whole lot of shots had gone off right near the barracks.
I had gone over and gotten a little juiced at the Enlisted Men's Club.
Somebody's shooting.
They're shooting over there.
Everybody up. Wake them up, Wilkie.
Move it.
Come on, Un-ass them bunks.
Come on, you Geechees.
Off your asses, on your feet.
Everybody up.
- Let's go.
- What's going on, man?
Company, a-ten-hut.
There's been a shooting.
One of ours bucked the line at Williams' pay phone and three soldiers are dead.
Two colored, one white MP.
The man who bucked the line, he killed the MP and the white boys started shooting everybody.
That's how our two got shot.
And this lowdown nigger we're looking for got chased down here.
Was almost caught till somebody in these barracks started shooting at the men chasing him.
So we got us a vicious, lowdown murdering piece of black trash in here somewhere.
And a few people who helped him.
If any of you are in this,
I want you to step forward.
All you baseball niggers are innocent?
- Wilkie.
- Sir.
Make the search.
Open those footlockers. Come on.
All right, Peterson, what are you waiting for, an invitation?
Open them up. Spread them out.
I wanna see what's happening inside.
Memphis, you in this?
No, sir, sarge.
You heard what the sergeant said.
How many of you were out tonight?
I was over at Williams' around about 7.
I got me a pack of Lucky Strikes.
- But I didn't try to call home, though.
- Got something.
Still warm.
C.J., is this yours?
You know it ain't mine, sarge.
Probably not.
Probably just crawled in through a window, passed everybody's bunk,
Peterson, Cobb, and just snuggled up under yours?
Must be voodoo, right, boy? Or some of that farmer's dust.
That ain't mine, sarge. I hate guns.
Makes me feel bad just to see a gun.
Liar. Place this man under arrest.
Look, sir, C.J. couldn't hurt a fly, sarge.
You know that.
I found a gun, soldier.
You know it ain't him.
Who is it then? You?
I saw somebody sneak in here.
You were drunk when you left the club.
Throw his ass in the shower.
Well, I was here all night.
C.J. ain't go nowhere.
He was asleep before I got to bed.
Oh, you think he's innocent?
C.J. Memphis, playing cotton picker, singing the blues, bowing and scraping, smiling in white folks' faces.
This man undermined us.
You and me. Everybody.
That "yes, sir, boss" is hiding something.
Are we like that today, in 1944?
He shot that white boy.
What are you going to do now, boy?
Hit a noncommissioned officer.
Well, C.J. just lost his head...
Shut up.
Get him out of here.
Sarge, I know I saw somebody.
Smalls, I saw somebody, I did.
Oh, C.J. was sleeping when I came in.
Well, it's Waters.
Can't y'all see that?
You know, I seen them before.
Yeah, we had them in Alabama.
White man give him a little-ass job as a servant, and when the boss ain't looking, that old copycat nigger act like he the new boss.
Shouting, ordering people around.
You see, arresting C.J., that'll get Waters another stripe.
Yeah.
Next, it'll be you or you.
You see, he can't look good unless he's standing on you.
Cobb told him C.J. was here all evening.
Waters didn't even listen, did he?
Turning somebody in.
"Yeah, look what I done, captain, boss."
Only reason they let him in is they know he'll do what they tell him to.
See, I've seen this kind of fool before, boy.
Yeah, somebody's gonna kill him one of these days.
I heard they killed a sergeant at Fort Robinson.
- A recruit did it.
- Forget it, Pete.
Our luck, sarge will come through the war, won't even get a scratch.
Yeah, maybe, but I'm going over to them stockades.
Tell them MPs what I know.
C.J. was in here all evening.
I'm gonna go with you.
Y'all wait up. I'm coming too.
Was Wilkie the only person out of his bunk?
I guess.
Wilkie came in with the sarge.
But it's hard to say.
It's been a while and like I said,
I was a little juiced that night.
- Ellis.
- Yes? Yes, sir?
Find out what's holding up my investigation of Wilcox and Byrd.
Yes, sir.
The night Sergeant Waters was killed, where were you?
I was in the barracks.
I played checkers with Cobb till 9:30 and then I went to bed.
Is there gonna be anything else, sir?
Dismissed, private.
Let her go.
Let me know when it's full board.
Here we go. Let's go, baby.
- Pick it up.
- Keep your rifles up.
That's it.
That's it, move out! Move out!
Move your ass!
That's it, move out! Move out!
Goddamn it, get going!
That's it, that's it, move it out!
- Shake it out! Hit that wall!
- Get your feet up!
Hurry it up! Hurry it up!
Move out! Move out! That's it!
- Watch it!
- Shake your ass! That's it!
Move it out!
Move it! Let's go!
Ellis!
Ellis!
Hold it!
- Stop shooting!
- Stop shooting!
Which one of you idiots is Cobb?
That's me, sir.
You all right, captain?
I wanna talk to you.
What'd he want old Cobb for?
I don't know.
What'd he ask you, Pete?
He just asked a couple of questions about the baseball game... some about the sarge.
Didn't amount to too much.
Yeah, we was homeys, me and
C.J., both from Mississippi.
C.J., from Carmella.
Me, I'm from up around Jutlerville, what they call Snake County.
How did you feel when your best friend was arrested?
I hated Waters for it, sir.
Hated?
C.J. ain't killed nobody.
He hit Waters, didn't he?
Yeah, but the sergeant made him, sir.
He called that boy things he ain't never heard before.
C.J. was from the farm, a country boy.
That jail cell started doing crazy things to C.J., sir.
It started closing in on him.
Are you all right?
It's hard to breathe in these little spaces, Cobb.
What they doing to you in here, C.J.?
Man wasn't made for this here.
Nothing was.
Don't think I'll ever see an animal in a cage again and not feel sorry for it.
Rather be on a chain gang.
Oh, come on, homey.
Don't think I'm getting out of here, Cobb.
Feel like I'm going crazy.
Can't walk in here.
Can't see the sun.
I tried to sing, but nothing won't come out.
Yesterday, I broke a guitar string.
And I lost my dust.
Got no protection, Cobb.
Nothing to keep the dogs from tearing at my bones.
C.J., stop talking crazy.
You know who come up here last night?
Sergeant Waters.
They talking about giving you five years.
They call what you did mutiny, boy.
That gun ain't mine.
We know that, C.J.
We changed the charge on you this morning.
You're in here for striking a superior officer, boy.
And everybody seen it too.
Why are you doing this to me, sarge?
Oh, don't feel too bad, C.J.
It has to be this way.
You see, the first war didn't change nothing for the Negro.
But this one, gonna change everything.
Them Nazis ain't all crazy.
Whole lot of people just can't seem to fit in to where things seem to be going.
Like you, C.J.
See, the black race can't afford you no more.
Oh, there used to be a time we'd see somebody like you singing, clowning,
"yes, sir, boss" ing, and we wouldn't do anything.
Folks liked that.
You were good.
Homey kind of nigger.
When they needed somebody to mistreat, call a name or two, they paraded you.
Reminded them of the good old days.
Not no more.
The day of the Geechee is gone, boy.
And you're going with it.
We can't let nobody go on believing we're all fools like you.
I waited a long time for you, boy.
But I got you.
I put two Geechees in jail in Camp Campbell, Kentucky.
Three in Fort Huachuca.
Now I've got you.
One less fool for the race to be ashamed of.
What happened to him?
C.J. killed himself, sir.
The day after I saw him, the MPs found him hanging from the bars.
We lost our last game.
We just threw it.
We did it for C.J.
Captain Taylor was mad because we ain't get to play the Yankees.
Peterson was right on that one.
We needed to protest that man.
And the sergeant, what did he do?
Well, they broke up the team and they assigned us to this here smoke-generating company.
And the sarge, he just started acting funny.
He stayed drunk all the time.
What time did you get in the night he was killed?
Between 2120 and 9:30.
Me and Henson listened to The Jack Benny show, played checkers.
Who was the last man in that night?
Peterson and Smalls.
They had guard duty, sir.
Is that it, captain?
Thank you, corporal.
Yes, sir.
Eight ball, corner pocket.
Whose idea was this, Charlie?
Nivens.
And you have to clear the area, Jim.
We're here to question these two.
He's got no business in here.
Take it up with the colonel.
Now, this is Captain Davenport.
You both understand, you're to give the captain your full cooperation.
You're a lawyer?
I'm not here to answer your questions, lieutenant.
Sit down.
Yes, sir.
When did you last see Waters?
Same night somebody killed him.
Course, I should've done it myself by the way he spoke to Wilcox and me.
How did he speak to you, captain?
Well, he was drunk. He said a few things he shouldn't have.
I told the lieutenant not to make the situation any worse than it was.
So we just left him there, on the side of the road, on his knees.
Alive.
Exactly what did he say?
He said he wasn't gonna obey the white man's orders anymore.
And he starts blaming
Wilcox and me for him being black.
I mean, imagine that,
Hell, I didn't even know the man.
Yeah and he said he killed somebody too.
And some pretty insulting things about us.
I mean, white officers.
Did he say who? Mention a name?
Look, the goddamn nigger was disrespectful.
No way a colored soldier speak to a white officer like that.
What are we doing, wasting time on this?
You answer him like he wants you to, Byrd, or I'll stick it to your ass every chance I get.
You got that?
Yes, sir.
Captain, let me handle this.
Then handle it.
You said he was disrespectful.
Is that why you killed him?
- I killed no one.
- Sit down.
- You hit him?
- Knocked him down.
- Shot him.
- He was alive.
You beat him up, shot him.
Get out of my face before I kill you.
Like Waters?
- No!
- Soldier.
He's trying to put it on me.
Sit down.
Answer his questions, lieutenant.
You were both coming off bivouac?
Speak up.
You had weapons.
But we didn't fire.
When did you turn them in?
Right away.
Nivens took our .45s to the MPs.
He wanted it quiet.
Didn't want colored boys to know anybody white was involved.
But those weapons cleared ballistics.
Besides, we've been short on .45 caliber ammo for, what, six months?
It's for MPs and special-duty people only.
Look, nobody on that exercise was issued any.
What?
I said, sir, nobody on the bivouac was issued any .45 ammo.
I don't believe you.
Why wasn't I told?
The weapons had cleared, the colonel felt if he involved you, you'd go to Washington, which you did anyway.
Sir, I just wanna say we were not involved with the sergeant's death.
Now, I'm a doctor.
We left that man on the side of the road. Alive.
- You're under arrest.
- The charge is murder.
Captain...
You think I believe that crap?
Let them go.
What?
- Are we being charged?
- Not by me.
What are you doing? You've got a motive, you've got a witness.
I mean, what more do you want?
This is still my investigation,
Charlie.
We've both been had, captain.
Colonel knew this all along.
Been marching around in circles.
They are guilty and you know it.
Now, I'll back you up.
Charge them.
I do what the facts tell me, not you.
You don't know what a fact is.
I'm the lawyer.
They teach law at West Point?
You don't have to be a lawyer to deal with those two assholes.
And if they didn't kill Waters, who did?
I don't know yet.
What do you know about C.J. Memphis?
A great ballplayer.
Committed suicide.
It was a tragedy.
I think Waters tricked the kid into attacking him.
No, I can't believe that,
Davenport.
This man managed the finest baseball team in the entire
United States Army.
Besides, colored people aren't that devious.
Hell, we hadn't lost a game for two years.
And the finest...
I mean, the finest player that
Waters ever had was C.J. Memphis.
If you'd have seen him, you'd know what I mean.
Captain. Captain Davenport.
We found Wilkie, but we haven't located Peterson and Smalls yet.
- Where's Wilkie?
- Waiting for you, sir.
- Good.
- Wait.
Didn't you question
Wilkie and Peterson already?
I asked you a question.
This is my investigation.
Ellis, let's go.
Well, that's the problem.
You arrogant son of a bitch.
You nervous, Wilkie?
No, I just couldn't figure out why you called me back, sir.
You said the sarge busted you, right?
Yeah, he got me busted, sir.
He reported me to the captain.
- How'd you feel?
- Well, I...
You and the sarge were good friends.
- Yeah...
- He was a nice guy.
Didn't you tell me that?
Yeah, I...
Would a nice guy get a friend busted?
- Well...
- No, speak up.
You lied when you said he was a nice guy?
No. What I said was he was...
Was Waters a nice guy or not?
No. No, he wasn't a nice guy.
You don't turn somebody in.
Give him extra duty.
But three stripes, it took me
10 years to get them stripes, sir.
That's right.
That made you mad, didn't it?
Yes, mad. Things I did for him.
That's right. You were his boy, weren't you?
You took care of the team.
- You ran his errands.
- Well...
You policed his quarters.
You listened to his stories.
Put the gun under C.J.'s bunk.
Yes. No...
Sit down!
It was you Henson saw. You lied about Waters, you're lying now.
The only person out of barracks. Who else could've found C.J.'s bunk?
It was you, Wilkie. You.
It was the sarge.
He ordered me to do it.
He said I'd get my stripes back.
He wanted to teach C.J. a lesson.
Put him in jail, scare him.
The boy hit him, he had C.J. where he wanted him.
And then C.J., he hung himself.
He died like he was spiting the sarge.
He didn't figure on that.
What did he have against Memphis?
He despised him, but he would hide it, everybody liked that boy.
Underneath, it was a crazy hate, captain.
Crazy hate. You won't believe it.
Sometimes you could...
You could just feel it.
♪ Well, now my daddy's
Gone to glory ♪
♪ I work real hard, I drink corn liquor
That's the truth ♪
He's the kind of boy that seems innocent, Wilkie.
Got everybody on the post thinking he's a strong, black buck.

His speed.
Power in his swing.

♪ Yes, he would ♪ ♪
You know the damage one ignorant Negro can do?
We were in France in the first war, we'd won decorations, but the white boys had told all them French gals that we had tails.
And they found this ignorant colored soldier.
Paid him to tie a tail to his ass and run around half-naked making monkey sounds.
They put him on a big round table in the Café Napoléon.
Put a reed in his hand, a crown on his head, blanket on his shoulders, and made him eat bananas in front of them Frenchies.
Oh, how the white boys danced that night, passed out leaflets with that boy's picture on it.
Called him Moonshine, king of the monkeys.
When we slit his throat, you know that fool asked us what he had done wrong?
My daddy told me, we got to turn our backs on his kind, Wilkie.
Close our ranks to the chitlins, collard greens, corn-bread style.
We are men, soldiers.
And I don't intend for our race to be cheated out of its place of honor and respect in this war because of fools like C.J.
You watch everything he does.
Everything.
Give me a drink.
And I watched him.
But Waters couldn't wait.
He wouldn't talk about nothing else.
C.J. this, C.J. all the time.
Why didn't he pick on Peterson?
They had the fight.
He liked Peterson.
Pete fought back.
Sarge admired that.
He was planning to promote Pete.
You imagine that?
He thought Peterson would make a fine soldier.
What did Peterson do when C.J. died?
Everybody blamed sarge.
Pete put together that protest that lost our last game.
Afterwards, he kept to himself or with Smalls.
I didn't mean to do what I did.
- Ellis!
- It wasn't my fault.
- Ellis!
- Yes, sir.
I did what he told me.
What is going on?
We're shipping out.
They're gonna give us Negroes a chance to fight.
Hitler ain't got a chance. After what
Joe Louis did to Max Schmeling...
Twenty-four-hour standby alert.
It's the invasion of Europe, boys.
Look out, Hitler, the niggers is coming to get your ass through the fog.
We gonna goose the goose step there.
Heil Hitler!
We gonna turn them Nazis around.
Yeah!
We're gonna teach them a thing or two about them schwarze.
- Ellis.
- Yes, sir.
Private Wilkie is under arrest.
Take him to the stockade.
Sir?
You heard me.
Private Smalls, as you requested, sir.
- Leave us alone, sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
Why'd you go AWOL, soldier?
Private Anthony Smalls, sir.
Answer my question.
I didn't go A-W-O-L, sir.
See, I got drunk in Tynin and I was just...
Weren't you and Peterson supposed to be on detail?
Where was Peterson?
Speak up.
I don't know, sir.
You just walked off your detail and Peterson did nothing?
No, sir.
See, he warned me, sir. Said, "Listen, Smalls.
Listen up, you..."
Are you trying to make a fool out of me, Smalls?
No, sir.
You two went over the hill together, didn't you?
Answer me!
Yes.
Yes. You went over the hill because Peterson knew I'd find out the two of you killed Waters.
Didn't you?
What? I can't hear you.
You killed Waters, didn't you?
I want an answer.
Did you kill Waters?
It was Peterson, sir.
It wasn't me.
Smalls, look who's drunk on his ass, boy.
Oh, leave him be, Pete.
No, no.
No, I'm gonna enjoy this.
Big, bad Sergeant Waters down on his knee.
No, sir, Smalls.
No, I'm gonna love this.
Hey, sarge.
Need some help?
Hi, Pete.
Oh, yeah. Here, come on now, here we go.
- That's the help I'll give you. Shut up!
- Peter...
Smalls, some people...
If this was a German, would you kill it?
If it was Hitler or that fucking
Tojo, would you kill him?
There's a trick to it, Peterson.
It's the only way you can win.
See, C.J., he could never make it.
He was a clown.
A clown in blackface. A nigger.
See, you got to be like them.
But the rules are fixed and...
Listen.
Hear it?
It's C.J.
♪ Lowdown
Lowdown dirty shame ♪ ♪
I made him do it.
But it doesn't make any difference.
They still hate you.
Peterson. It's justice, Smalls.
It's for C.J.
Everybody. They still hate you.
And you call that justice?
No, sir.
Then why the fuck didn't you do something?
I was just...
Just scared of him, sir.
He said everybody would think white people did it.
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I was just so scared about it.
Caught this one on old bridge road, sir.
That'll be all, thank you.
You told it, didn't you?
I didn't kill much.
Some things need getting rid of.
A man like Waters never did nobody no good anyway, captain.
Who gave you the right to judge?
To decide who is fit to be a Negro and who is not? Who?
Sergeant.
Sir?
Get these goddamn men out of here.
Yes, sir.
I hear they caught Peterson.
I guess that's it.
Got your man.
Yeah, I got him.
I was wrong.
So was I.
Say, Charlie, look,
I could do with a lift.
Hop in.
I guess I'll have to get used to
Negroes with bars on their shoulders.
You know, being in charge.
Oh, you'll get used to it, captain.
You can bet your ass on that.
You'll get used to it.
Hut!
Hit it!
Go! Drive!
Suck it up, Jeff!
Jack, harder!
Ready about!
Hard alee!
Let's go, guys! Come on!
Bring it in! Get the jib!
Cannonball is outpointing us.
Trim it!
- Hold back.
- Trimming the jibsheet now!
Let's go! Come on!
I need more helm.
Traveler up.
- OK, guys.
- Cannonball!
- Move it!
- Hold it down!
- Get it up!
- Watch the boom!
We got 'em.
I think we got 'em.
Come on. Come on.
Hit it! Go! Hit it!
Drive! Suck it up!
Shit!
Be at Four Winds at 6:30.
- Mr. Morrison...
- I won't spend money to lose.
It takes a long time to get a boat right.
She kicked ass to windward.
Yeah, she did that.
She'll be awesome when we get her tuned.
If I'm not in the poorhouse!
Hi, Jillian.
This is Tim Whalen.
Jillian Wyles.
- Hi.
- Well, I'm out of here.
Obsession's spending the summer in the yard.
Tim's staying with her.
Anybody have a garage apartment available?
I'll ask around.
Got to keep my captain happy.
This is the first summer
I've looked forward to in years.
He really trusts me.
Who?
Your husband.
CG? (Laughs)
Thank God.
It's not that painful, is it?
No, that's the problem.
It feels too good to stop.
We could always give it a try.
Maybe we should stop this.
Or maybe this.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
What?
You want your birthday present, don't you?
You remembered.
That's more than my husband did.
You want me to put these on?
I can't bite them off if you don't.
Olivia Lawrence.
Marjorie Little.
Kathleen Monahan.
Hey, Liv.
Mike!
How are you?
Get in.
- What's this?
- I'm a cop.
Yeah, I can see that.
I thought you were studying law.
I did. I worked hard, took the state police forensics course, and now I am the law.
When did you get in?
Last night.
You seen anybody?
No. I've been in the house all day.
(Radio) It's 547 Broadway.
547 Broadway on the fifth floor.
I'm sorry about your mom.
Thanks.
Headquarters to 209.
That's me.
Respond to Le French Crepe,
Main and Hampton.
Theft of service. 10-4?
It's a ditch and dine.
I gotta roll.
First major crime wave of the summer.
OK.
(Man) Yep.
Launch dropped them off.
Two minutes later, six people are dead.
Harbormaster said they never knew what hit them.
Your old man's a barrel of laughs.
Two or three propane explosions each year.
No sense getting killed because of a $5 piece of hose.
Why don't we take a look right now?
Thanks, Sam.
If he needs it, use it.
I heard
Obsession's gonna be in most of the summer.
Morrison's doing
200 thou's worth of work.
Jesus!
If I wasn't doing it,
I'd swear his captain was in for a taste.
He told me to take my time.
Only use the best.
Maybe he wants a summer in the Hamptons.
I gotta go.
Did you ever meet him?
- Who?
- Tim Whalen.
Morrison's captain.
I heard of him.
I never met him.
I know
I've seen him somewhere.
You coming to dinner this week?
How's Wednesday?
I'll tell your mother.
See you later, Pop.
How you doing?
Hey, Tommy.
Captain. I got some parts for you to look at.
May I see your invitation, sir?
It's all right, Mike.
He's with me.
Nice to see you,
Mrs. Morrison.
I didn't see your name on the invitation list.
I'm crashing.
You look incredible.
Thank you.
Have one on me, OK?
OK.
I understand you're teaching at the club.
I just started.
My two granddaughters already have mad crushes on you.
Oh, there's someone
I want you to meet.
The Lawrence girl.
Terrible about her mother, huh?
Olivia Lawrence,
Tim Whalen.
And of course, you know Brooke Morrison.
Hello, Mrs. Morrison. Hi.
Nice to meet you.
Well, Tim, dance with this young lady while Brooke and I gossip.
Mrs. Chase...
Shh. It'll be good for you.
Come along,
Brooke, darling.
Would you like to dance?
Who was the guy you were dancing with?
Boyfriend?
No.
Good.
2-0-9. Headquarters to 2-0-9.
Resume normal patrol until 0100. 10-4?
10-4. I'll be in in 10 minutes.
Put some coffee on for me, Bernadette.
You ever been to the Hamptons before?
No. Mr. Morrison's had
Obsession down south since I've been on her.
Me, too.
You ever meet a man named Gateworth on the southern circuit?
Yeah. He's a real jerk.
He's here tonight, over at the bar.
He's my mother's last husband.
I guess I put my foot in my mouth.
I should have worn my mint-flavored shoes.
In Bermuda, he rammed me coming into the harbor.
He shouldn't be allowed to tail a jibsheet.
You sail.
Since before I could walk.
Would you like to go out sometime... on the water?
Are you a member at the club?
Uh-huh.
You should come down.
I'm there every day.
Yes. Time to go.
How about Wednesday?
Wednesday's great. 2:00?
OK.
Hi.
Looks like you two got along.
She's a nice kid.
She's the richest nice kid on the east coast.
Really?
The only thing money's good for is to make a boat go faster.
Hi, Tony.
When did you get here?
Huh? (Drunken laughter)
(Woman) That Tony Gateworth.
He's drunk again.
He's never sober.
Well, well, well.
Please don't embarrass both of us.
I'm not the one climbing all over boat niggers.
When did you start chasing white trash?
I don't.
Milady.
Save your breath.
I don't care what the offer is, the answer is no.
All I'm asking is that you talk to
Theodore Cantrell and try to work something out.
You think I'll give up Aspen or Hobe Sound or summers here?
Forget it.
Anyway, my dear, you know your mother wanted me here with you.
You fooled her.
You never fooled me.
Hi. Anne Briscoe.
You must be
Tony's stepdaughter.
Yeah. Olivia Lawrence.
Darling, could you send somebody to the cleaners to get my dress?
Alberto will be happy to do it.
What is the princess's problem?
A little bitch.
(Olivia) Not only is Gateworth living off my money but he's trying to run my life.
Unfortunately, this office drew up the will.
Short of his remarrying, there's no way to keep Gateworth out of the residences.
Maybe I should buy a house.
You already own eight, Olivia.
They're not mine as long as he's there.
Key money?
How much does he get from Mommy's estate?
228,000 last quarter.
If you married, your husband would be in the same situation once you had a baby.
The child would inherit your estate, and your husband would be generously provided for.
Gateworth gets a million a year.
He won't need key money.
It's not enough.
He's usually in trouble six weeks into the quarter.
How?
If you lose $112,000 in three days in Atlantic City, you can probably use extra cash.
Could he ever get back in?
Not if he signed a quitclaim against his right of occupancy.
Let's try it.
I'll see what I can do.
You realize, though, if he says no, there's nothing we can do.
(Olivia) You really like that movie?
I love that movie.
It's been ages since
I've been to the movies.
I feel like I'm 16 again.
Those were fun summers.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
Maybe I'll...
Graduate school.
Maybe travel for a while.
Try and figure out what I want to do with my life.
Do you remember when we were 12?
The summer I taught you how to sail.
Summer before that.
What you told your mom.
That we would get married when we grew up.
I guess some dreams don't die.
It's the wrong dream, Mike.
You're right.
All right, get out of here.
I'll see you on Friday.
Bye!
That was great!
That was boring.
I didn't think you'd come.
I didn't think I was going to.
Well, you're right on time - to the second.
It's a little problem I have - compulsive promptness.
Maybe we could take my boat out?
- Great.
- OK.
- She's beautiful.
- Yeah.
She's no Obsession but she was
Daddy's pride and joy.
When did he die?
When I was 12.
Mrs. Morrison says that your mother died recently.
Yeah. A couple of months ago.
Both my parents were killed in a plane crash eight years ago.
We should be getting back.
You want to take her?
OK.
(Olivia) Ready about?
Hard alee!
Wanna grab a beer?
We can get one at my house.
Where do you live?
Dune Road.
Longview Cottage.
(Tim) Cute cottage.
My grandparents built it in '28.
They had a house in Bar Harbor, but Gramps got tired of spending summers alone.
- Shit!
- Who's that?
Gateworth's girlfriend.
Anne Briscoe,
Tim Whalen.
- Hi.
- How do you do?
I'm doing fine.
Nice to meet you.
Just can't stay away from the help, Olivia?
I don't want to listen to this.
Then you listen,
Romeo.
You keep sniffing around my stepdaughter, you'll be out of a job.
I'm talking to Cantrell.
Talk to your heart's content.
I'm not leaving here.
(Tim) I should be getting back.
Good idea. Get back and hump Brooke Morrison.
I'm sorry about that.
Don't worry about it.
Would you like to have dinner sometime?
Go out?
Well, I'm not much of a cook.
Sure. I'd love to.
- Friday?
- OK.
Listen, about what
Gateworth said...
Oh, that's none of my business...
I spend a lot of time with the Morrisons and all I know is she's really in love with her husband.
How long had you been on Morning Star?
Three years.
Skipper for the last two.
A good boat but I couldn't win with her.
Thank you.
When Mr.
Morrison offered me Obsession
I jumped at the chance.
Thanks.
You were awfully young to be on the helm.
I was the youngest captain on the Southern
Ocean Racing Circuit.
Do you race?
I've beaten every guy my age from Montauk to City Island.
Any ocean racing?
Nobody ever gave me a shot.
You'd be too much of a distraction.
Ah! (Laughs)
(Tim) All I really wanted to do was sail.
I barely lasted two semesters at college.
The day classes ended,
I ferried a one-ton from Santa
Barbara to Palm Beach.
Daddy would have really liked you.
She changed husbands as often as she changed cars.
She had three in eight years.
But Gateworth, he was by far the worst.
What was she looking for?
I don't know.
I think she wanted someone to love her for her.
That was a really good movie.
Why are we whispering?
I don't know.
It sort of feels like we ought to.
Good night.
Your mother made it clear she wanted me to keep an eye on you.
What I'm seeing would make her spin in her grave.
From Virgin Mary to Mary Magdalene in under a month.
I don't want to talk about it.
I want you to stop seeing him.
You'll embarrass me and the family.
I will? You've been an embarrassment ever since you conned my mother into marrying you.
Don't you ever touch me!
I'm going away for the weekend.
When I get back,
I want the boat nigger out of your life!
I hate him.
I really hate him.
Look on the bright side.
At least we'll get to spend the weekend together.
At my house.
I'll give the staff the weekend off.
God, I want to kiss you.
I've been warned against public displays of affection on club property.
(Man) Lobster roll!
Pick up!
Lobster roll!
Everything OK over here?
(Woman) It's very good.
(Waitress) Two lobster rolls and a chicken-fried steak.
(Man) Erin, you bus number three.
Sorry I'm late.
What do you know about him?
He's from California.
Both his parents are dead.
He has a married sister in San Francisco.
He loves sailing as much as I do and he's the first man
I've ever been comfortable with.
We have too much money.
You know that.
He doesn't care about that.
If he really doesn't care, grab him.
Ones like that are as rare as your father.
The important thing is to establish a psychological dominance.
Once she sees you can handle me, she'll be totally dependent on you.
Just be careful with that gun.
I'm not about to hurt the guy who's going to lay the golden egg.
Come on. Cheer up.
A year from now, the late Olivia
Lawrence-Whalen's grieving husband and stepfather will both be on the Forbes 400.
I have a better idea.
Well, I'd just love to hear it.
There's so much money, maybe we'd be better off with her around.
Forget it.
Look, I think the heat will be too much.
Think? You don't think.
I think. You perform.
The only way this deal goes south is if you fuck it up.
You want out? Fine.
You're on the first bus to Palookaville and I'll find another gigolo.
You think she'll fall for whoever you drag in?
She fell for you, didn't she?
Hey, we can get everything we want, maybe more, by keeping her healthy.
I'll make it real simple.
You're either in now, or you're out.
And you even think of fucking with me, she's gonna know your whole life story, the real one.
You got that?
Yeah, I got it.
Well, that's better, partner.
More coffee?
What was that?
What's wrong?
I heard something.
You fucking little whore!
Bringing this garbage into your mother's house?
- That's enough!
- Shut up!
- Give me the gun!
- I said stay away from her!
Look, calm down.
Nobody wants...
I'll blow your...
For God's sakes, Tony!
You f...
Is he...?
Call the police.
My God...
Do you...do you realize how this is going to look?
They're gonna think we planned this.
Yeah.
You've got to go.
You go.
I'll call the police.
What will you say?
I don't know. I'll say...
I'll...I'll say that...
I was here alone, and he came in, and I thought he was a burglar.
And you just happened to have a gun.
That's Tony's gun.
I'll say, I got it from his night table earlier, nobody was in the house...
It won't work!
It will work!
It was fired point blank.
They can tell.
Then I'll say that...
I'll say that he tried to rape me.
Nobody can prove
I didn't do it!
Yes, they can!
- How?
- Guns leave powder on your hand.
They can tell you haven't fired one.
Let's just call the police and tell the truth.
Now you have to go.
There's no way they'll believe us if we both have... powder on our hand.
God. I'm going to be sick!
I love you.
I love you.
Hi.
You're awfully late.
Yeah, I had to stay late, settle them down.
I even promised Abrams he could get off the foredeck as soon as Obsession's ready.
We don't get many nights together, you know.
I know. What can I do to make it up to you?
Taking off your clothes would be a good start.
Affirmative, 17. 187 at Longview Cottage.
And he fell after you kicked him?
I grabbed the gun...
Gateworth's gun.
And...
Yeah, I got it from his room this afternoon.
Worried about local burglars.
And the staff had the weekend off so I...
God!
You OK?
Yeah. Is he gone?
He's gone.
It was just an accident.
It was...
What about the second shot?
I don't... It just went off.
My hand jerked.
OK. It's OK. I told you,
I just have to ask.
He told you he'd be gone for a week.
He comes back at night, drunk, tries to attack you.
- You were terrified?
- Yes.
This will have to go by the DA, but this is going to be justifiable homicide.
Do you want to go someplace, call somebody?
Yeah. I'd like to go over to Holly's place.
OK.
You listen to me.
Don't say anything to anyone except your attorney, OK?
You know the press, they'll be all over you.
I don't want you to have any problems, because Gateworth sure wasn't worth it.
Thanks, Mike.
Come on.
Joe.
Will you please take
Miss Lawrence over to
Holly Morgan's residence?
- Have the detectives been here yet?
- Uh-uh.
(Man, distant) Yeah.
That's right.
Get that as well.
Did that show anything?
Nothing.
The wall's clear, right?
Theodore Cantrell.
I'm Miss Lawrence's attorney.
You were the investigating officer?
Yes, sir.
This is my chief, Ed Wells.
Lieutenant Wacker,
Suffolk County Police, homicide.
Why wasn't
Miss Lawrence arrested?
On the weapons charge?
It was my decision because the weapon was licensed.
We met with the District Attorney this morning.
Unless new evidence is forthcoming, we don't anticipate filing any charges.
I'm going upstairs.
Lieutenant.
I'll be outside.
Thank you.
County police are letting us work this one alone.
I've known the Lawrence family my whole life.
My father helped build this house.
Now, Mr. Cantrell, the DA doesn't want to see
Olivia Lawrence's picture plastered all over the National Enquirer, and neither do I.
Know what I mean?
I was so scared.
If the DA goes along with this, we're home free.
He lay there for hours.
If anything goes wrong
I'm coming forward.
That's the worst thing to do.
It was self-defense.
They'd think we were in it together or you were lying.
This is going to ruin everything, isn't it?
It was an accident.
The only way it's going to affect us is if we let it.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
A man was murdered and you're not doing anything!
There's not one scintilla of evidence implicating Miss Lawrence.
That is the most insane...
For Christ's sake, she shot him!
Look, Tony was no saint, but this isn't right.
It's just not right.
Unfortunately, you're simply not in possession of all the facts.
Well, maybe you'd better fill me in on all the facts before I go to the state Attorney General!
Did you know that Mr. Gateworth was going to return to the Hamptons this weekend?
No.
He wasn't supposed to be back until Tuesday.
Were you aware that he'd made advances toward Miss Lawrence before?
That's ridic...
What, did she tell you that?
No, ma'am.
Two members of the staff observed incidents on separate occasions.
I don't believe it.
We do.
On the night that he died,
Mr. Gateworth returned home in the middle of the night, entered his stepdaughter's bedroom and attempted to rape her.
She defended herself.
He had a blood-alcohol level of .15.
He was quite drunk.
It doesn't make sense.
He hated her.
Rape's a crime of violence, ma'am, not affection.
It's so hot in here.
Mr. Gateworth's death was regrettable but he wasn't murdered.
What about the boyfriend?
What boyfriend?
Her boyfriend.
What, you don't know about him?
It figures.
A professional sailor.
Tony despised him.
What's his name?
I don't know!
I only met him once!
But I'd sure as hell talk to him!
Know anything about a boyfriend?
No, sir.
I'll check it out.
Jesus!
Just what I needed.
There wasn't anything that indicated someone else had been in the house?
No, sir.
Alberto.
Alberto?
Hi, Mike.
Social call?
I wish it was.
You have a new boyfriend.
I shouldn't be telling you this.
Gateworth's girlfriend's making all kinds of noise.
Says he hated the guy you've been going out with.
Now, is there anything else you want to tell me?
I told you exactly what happened.
I don't think you told me everything.
I asked around. You've been seeing a guy named Tim Whalen.
He has nothing to do with this.
You two had dinner at the Colombe D'or?
- So?
- You didn't leave till after 10:00.
And we got here by 10:30 and Tim left by 11:30.
Liv, I know you couldn't kill anyone.
You're good.
I'll give you that.
You're really good.
You had me fooled.
- It wasn't like that.
- Look. It's no contest.
I'm married, and she's got
$200 million.
You hit the jackpot.
Come on, I mean, you know how much
I care about money.
I wouldn't believe you if you told me water was wet!
You stay away from me, all right?
One more thing...
I was out with Olivia the night
Gateworth was killed.
The police may want to verify my whereabouts around midnight.
- Are you crazy?
- Just tell them the truth.
I was at your place from 11:30 on.
You know what will happen if this gets out?
Like I said, if it comes up, tell the truth.
That's all I'm gonna tell them.
There's no reason for me to get into all that other stuff that you told me and get perfectly innocent guys involved.
You prick.
Brooke Morrison?
Whalen wouldn't name her until I suggested he killed Gateworth.
And?
She confirmed it.
He was there from 11:30 on.
You believe her?
She'd love to cause him problems.
He dumped her.
That's that.
Except for Anne Briscoe.
I told Mrs. Morrison
I'd try to keep her name out of it.
No problem.
If Briscoe doesn't keep her mouth shut we'll have to show her how we know he's not involved.
I'll tell her the case is closed.
That may not do it.
I mean, suppose Gateworth was killed an hour earlier?
What are you trying to say?
He walked in on them?
Yeah. Maybe, yeah.
And they got into some kind of beef.
- You got any proof?
- Not yet.
Then I don't want to hear about it.
You grew up here!
Christ,
I have to draw you a picture?
- No, sir.
- All right.
He's absolutely perfect...
I mean, aside from the fact that he's gorgeous and he's charmed the pants off the family.
He's obviously crazy about you, and that's the only thing that really matters.
- I love him.
- No kidding.
- Uncle Charlie, this is a great wedding.
- Thanks for coming.
- Thanks for inviting me.
- Nice to meet you.
- I'll get the car.
- OK.
- Your friend made quite a hit.
- I knew he would.
Could I make a suggestion?
- Why? What kind?
- Let me run a check on him.
I need him a lot more than he needs me.
- Thanks.
- Bye-bye.
So what's the Deering story?
Oh, er, Nina was two years ahead of me in school, and...
..Lex is a stuffed shirt.
He's the type who'll meet somebody and then he'll go home and check if they're in the Social Register.
- She seemed nice.
- Yes.
They had to get married.
Nobody has to get married today.
Catholics do.
All three of the Kaiser girls were shotgun.
- Daddy's right.
- About what?
- Champagne.
- What'd he say?
"Makes girls dance and drop their pants."
Milk? Sugar?
No.
Maybe a little something stronger?
No, thank you.
Look, Miss Briscoe, there's no one who'd rather pin Gateworth's murder on Whalen than me, but I can't do a thing without proof.
(Scoffs) Give me a break.
Nobody in this town is going to rock that little bitch's boat.
That's not true of me.
Yeah?
Well, I've got something, but I'm going to the papers.
Let's see how she feels about that.
I really hope you don't do that.
Going to the media will just prejudice a criminal prosecution.
I know everybody in this town.
I know the summer people, the winter people, the poor people.
Yeah. So?
One of my poor friends was in Carlson's diner the day that Tony died.
Tony walked in, sat with some young kid, and they had an argument.
Did your friend recognize this kid?
No. He never saw him before, but he'd recognize him if he saw him again.
It was that sailor.
I know it was him.
So either you do something... or I'm going to.
- What's your friend's name?
- Uh-uh.
You get that
Keystone Kop police chief to reopen this investigation,
I'll bring my friend in.
(Olivia) Marry me!
- What did you say?
- You heard me.
Olivia...
A simple "yes" would be fine.
You know I love you.
Jesus! Forget it.
Pretend I never said it.
There's nothing in the world
I'd rather do, I...
I just don't think you know enough about me.
You rob banks or something?
- Bounce checks.
- For a living?
When I quit school,
I got caught with no money.
I wrote a lot of bad checks, spent 30 days in jail.
And for that, you won't marry me?
- There's something else.
- What?
Gateworth was right about one thing.
I did have an affair with Brooke Morrison.
When did it stop?
The day I met you.
Look at me.
I have nothing.
I have three pairs of Top-Siders, some foul-weather gear.
- Not even a credit card.
- Do you love me?
Yes, but we shouldn't get married yet.
I have nothing to give to you.
By the authority vested in me by the state of New York,
I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Don't go anywhere.
Hello.
Hi, Mr. Fitzgerald.
Yes.
It's true.
Yesterday afternoon.
No, we didn't tell anyone.
What did she write?
That's not true.
All right. We'll see you here tomorrow at ten o'clock. OK.
What's wrong?
Gossip columnist got ahold of the wedding.
She wrote that you're the boyfriend
Anne Briscoe's been screaming about all over the Hamptons.
There's nothing to panic about.
I'm only worried some prosecutor will press for a murder indictment if Miss Briscoe keeps shooting her mouth off.
I think you two should draw up new wills.
If I could get a list of assets...
You're looking at 'em.
This is out of my league.
I'll let you talk to them.
Excuse me.
CG Morrison is very upset with you.
Says you've cost him the best damned helmsman on the SORC.
- What do you think?
- I think he's a superb sailor.
I hope he'll be as good a husband.
(Radio) We have a 489 in progress.
Check the car.
What's the deceased's name?
Anne Briscoe.
She might have changed her mind.
She was really clawing at the belt.
- What time?
- Between midnight and two.
I want an autopsy ASAP.
- What am I looking for?
- Cause of death.
Shortness of breath.
- Don't fuck with Dick Tracy.
- There is a suicide note.
Right, a typed suicide note, unsigned.
Real convincing.
OK, guys.
You can go get her.
Did you bring a body bag?
Hi.
Good morning.
You slept late today.
Yeah.
I sleep like a baby with you.
I'm going down to have Mr.
McGill do some work on Masquerade.
(Maid) Phone call,
Miss Olivia.
Mr. Cantrell.
Thank you.
Hello? Hi, Mr. Cantrell.
Jesus! When?
No, we...
Yes, I will.
Thank you.
Anne Briscoe killed herself last night.
- Six by six or nine by nine?
- (Sam) Nine by nine.
All right, here you go.
- That's a 16".
- Yeah.
- What did Whalen want?
- He's checking on Obsession.
She'll be in the water in six weeks.
He's still working for Morrison?
Yeah, but I'm not complaining.
Now he's buying for two boats.
What's wrong with Masquerade?
Propane line.
They're going to be cruising in the fall so... he wanted it checked.
That guy's a phony.
Well, if you ask my opinion,
I don't think he won the grand prize.
That kind of money's its own prison.
- Lock me up.
- Mike.
You know what's funny?
I know I could have made her happy.
I know it.
You can drive yourself crazy.
Not me, Pop.
Son of a bitch!
It was worth every damn penny!
- She gonna start winning?
- She'll kick ass.
If you come south and race her.
Doesn't Olivia have a house in Florida?
Hobe Sound.
You really want to turn this boat over to somebody else?
That's a low blow, Mr.
Morrison.
Whatever it takes to win.
By the way,
Mike McGill came over the other day.
He was asking a lot of questions about you.
That cop hates you.
I noticed.
Be careful.
I remember him from the marina.
He's been in love with your wife for years.
Talk to her.
Come to Florida.
How would you like to go to Florida next month?
Obsession's sailing better?
Unbelievable.
And Mr. Morrison wants you to do the Southern Racing Circuit.
He knows we can win big.
- I have no objections.
- You don't?
It would be quite pleasant being pregnant in Florida.
You know how
I've been feeling yucky lately?
Well, I went to see
Dr. Morton yesterday, and he didn't know what was wrong so he ran a pregnancy test...
But you've been on the pill.
Yeah. It happens, not very often, but it does happen.
God, you're upset.
No, I'm stunned. I...
I mean,
I just can't believe it.
I'm very happy.
You are?
You are?
Yeah.
I said fine.
I'll be there tonight.
Yeah. Yeah.
OK, I'll see you.
Does this mean what I think it means?
This weekend?
- It's stupid meeting here.
- Chill out.
Nobody comes up here at night.
We have to talk.
Talk?
What's there to talk about?
I can't kill her.
When you improvised with Gateworth that was fine.
50 percent's better than 33 but I'm not letting you get 300 million all for yourself.
I don't give a shit about the money.
Right.
That's why you married her.
Look, it's gonna work out perfectly.
Like you said, everybody knows I hate you.
Christ, even the lawyers know
I hate you.
I clear you on accidental death, nobody's going to question it.
She's pregnant.
Jesus Christ.
Once the baby's born, it gets the money, so it's over.
I don't give a fuck if it's triplets!
I have done too much for this.
I spent a whole year setting this up.
I'm not gonna do it.
Listen up, my friend, because you'll only hear it once.
You're gonna do her, and we'll split a shitload of money, or you're going away for murder.
Really?
What proof do you have?
You forgot one thing in that bedroom - a glass with your fingerprints all over it.
That puts you there that night.
Ten to one I walk if it goes to a jury.
I don't want to take your money and your life.
There's more evidence that's real conclusive.
You planted something, you cock...!
Just give me a fucking excuse.
It's either her... or you.
You just want her dead.
That's what this is all about.
Happy birthday.
What's that smile for?
I'm just happy.
I'm so happy.
It's only 7:15.
What's the rush?
It's a surprise.
Hello, Raymond?
Bring it around.
Well?
Do you like it?
I love it!
Saint-Tropez etait vraiment tres bien l'ete dernier.
- Pardon?
- Saint-Tropez.
You'll come out of a sharp left-hand curve.
There's a big elm just past the apex.
Without a seat belt, she's history.
You wear yours, you'll be OK.
Hey.
What are you worried about?
A month from now you'll be able to buy Ferraris in colors.
Don't kill me.
He just got it this week.
- You're a fucking dead man.
- Just relax, all right?
Relax.
You're gonna have plenty of time to relax.
I figure, like, 15 to life.
- You're going down for Gateworth.
- I have an alibi.
Maybe.
But what about
Anne Briscoe?
You killed Anne Briscoe.
According to the evidence I found, you killed her.
Your move, Romeo.
Look, I told you I'll do it but I won't crash into a fucking tree.
I could have been killed myself.
Fine.
My old man says Masquerade's already had problems with its propane line.
It would be clean, easy.
Disconnect the propane flexihose at the stove, roughen the edges with a file like a rat chewed it, caused a leak.
- A rat?
- Yeah, a rat.
I'll put a big rat onboard.
They'll find it in the wreckage.
Accidental death guaranteed.
It'll be tough getting her on the boat alone.
Bullshit.
Tell her you'll meet her there at a certain time.
She's always on time, to the minute.
She knows her boats.
She sees the warning light, hits the pump... boom.
When do you leave for Florida?
Next Thursday.
I'm glad you're home.
Brooke Morrison wants us to have dinner tomorrow night.
- You sure you wanna do it?
- Uh-huh.
Yeah.
What's past is past.
- I had a wonderful evening.
- We'll see you tomorrow?
Yeah. Meet on the Obsession.
Is there a bathroom
I can use?
- Up the stairs, first bedroom.
- Thank you.
Let's hear from you.
I love you.
Very sweet.
Truce?
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
I'm glad you came up.
- Really?
- I wanted to thank you.
I mean,
I know about you and Tim and with him sailing Obsession
I think it's better if we all remain friends.
I really don't think you know the half of it.
I don't know what you mean.
I'm sure you don't.
Gateworth died around 11:30, didn't he?
You and Prince Charming were already an item then, weren't you?
We were seeing each other.
Seeing each other?
It was a little bit more than that, right, sweetheart?
I just thought you might want to know.
While you were plugging your stepfather, your husband was plugging me, and he was great.
Olivia.
I wouldn't trust the prick, if I were you.
Is it true?
Olivia, of course it's not true.
- You said it was over by then.
- It was.
- Are you sure?
- She told you a time, 11:30.
You know where I was.
I can't be in two beds at the same time.
Brooke is a hopeless alcoholic.
She's also insanely jealous.
She's just doing this to get back at me and hurt you.
- It really hurt.
- That's what she wanted it to do.
Don't ever lie to me.
Hey, Mike.
- What's up, Sam?
- Just replacing the Barient.
Whalen said it had to be done by tonight.
I thought they weren't leaving until next week.
They moved it up.
They're heading south tomorrow afternoon.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
That's what he told me.
- You feeling OK?
- Do I look OK?
- Morning sickness?
- Oh. Yeah.
Oh, God.
We don't have to leave today.
No, everybody says if you're going to be sick, you're going to be sick.
It doesn't matter where you are.
No, let's just go.
I'm sick of this town.
One o'clock?
You gonna be on time?
I wouldn't miss it.
Well, I'll buy groceries.
I love you.
Good.
28.40, please.
Alberto.
- Mrs. Whalen around?
- I'm afraid she's out.
Mr. Whalen?
He left about an hour ago.
I'll wait around for a couple of minutes.
- Hi, Olivia.
- Tommy, fill it up, please.
Yes, ma'am.
I know, Alberto. Did she call?
- 20 minutes ago.
- From the boat?
From town.
She'll be there at one.
On the nose.
Yes, sir.
And Officer McGill came by looking for Mrs. Whalen.
- What did he want?
- I don't know.
He waited inside for about ten minutes and then left.
OK. Thanks.
Well, this is a nice surprise.
- I'll take you to lunch.
- Great. On you?
Sure. Anything you want that's under a buck.
The Masquerade's looking sharp.
I varnished her last week.
Olivia, get off the boat!
Tim?
If you get to talk to any of those paramedics at all...
Chief. What happened?
Propane explosion.
Lawrence's old sloop, the Masquerade.
One DOA.
Olivia Lawrence?
- No, her husband, Tim Whalen.
- Tim?
Damn shame.
She's up in your father's office.
Let's go.
Mike?
Oh, my God.
Why?
Why, Mike?
You bastard!
..and may Timothy Whalen rest in peace. Amen.
Thank you, Father, for coming.
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Olivia.
Thank you for coming.
There's something
I have to tell you.
Tim came to see me two weeks ago.
Why? What about?
To have himself taken out of your will.
He made me swear that I wouldn't tell you.
But with what's come out, you have to know.
I think somehow he wanted to have all temptations removed.
I told him it was against your wishes but he was adamant.
He wanted nothing from you.
He loved you, Olivia.
However it started, he came to love you.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Are you Dr. Margaret Ford?
- Yes.
- Could I ask you-- Would you sign my book?
Yes, of course.
- I recognized you from your picture.
- Uh-huh.
- I hope I'm not inconveniencing you.
- No, not at all.
It's for a friend.
It's the second one I've bought.
Then I'm doubly pleased.
Thank you for buying it.
You've helped me very much.
I'm very glad I have.
Thank you.
Good-bye.
And I saw the face of an animal.
And I said that we all try to run from experience.
From experience.
Do you understand me?
But that it will seek us out.
You think that you're exempt?
I'm talking to you.
Do you think that you're exempt?
Do I think that I'm exempt?
That I'm exempt from what?
- Experience.
- No.
I don't think that I'm exempt.
Well, you better be assured you're not.
What is the animal?
- The animal.
- You said in your dream you saw the face of an animal.
- I don't know how to say it. It was--
- Yes?
It was a-- I--
I want to say--
I don't know how to say it.
- I'm so sorry I'm late.
- Oh, that's okay.
- You've eaten. Good.
- Now, how are you today, Maggie?
I'm fine. Listen to this.
In her dream, she saw a foreign animal.
What is the animal?
She cannot think of the name.
The animal is saying,
"I am only trying to do good."
I say, "What name comes up when you think of this animal?"
- She says--
- Yes?
"It is a 'lurg.'
It is called a 'lurg.'"
And so if we invert "lurg," a lurg is a girl.
And so she is the animal, and she is saying,
"I'm just trying to do good."
And now someone has heard her.
Good, Maggie.
Good for you. Good work.
And now, what are you going to eat?
I don't have time.
It's so beautiful.
It's old, and it's heavy.
It looks like someone gave it to you.
Sometimes I think the only pressures in my life--
- The only what?
- I'm sorry?
You said "the only pressures."
"Pleasures." I said "pleasures."
No. What you said was "pressures," and this is what I'm telling you.
Many things that should be pleasures are not.
Your book is a best seller.
Your income jumps up.
People think of you differently perhaps.
This is confusing.
Listen to me. Slow down.
Try to enjoy your success.
Give yourself all the rewards you would like to have.
You see a beautiful gold lighter... buy one for yourself.
Your friend asks you to lunch... go and eat lunch with her.
- Do you forgive me?
- No.
Good-bye.
Go work.
Uh, sort of a--
- A what?
- I don't know. A feeling of nothingness.
And what does that make you think of?
Will you leave me alone, for Christ's sake?
What does it matter?
What does it mean? You understand?
It's in my head or not. It doesn't make a difference.
- Billy--
- What?
Are you going to tell me
I'm entitled to my feelings?
What does it--
What the hell does it matter?
It matters if you're going to cure yourself.
If I'm going to cure myself.
- And what do I do now?
- What do you do now?
No, no. What do I do today?
What do I do tomorrow?
Today and tomorrow you say this:
I am a compulsive gambler.
The reasons for this are in the past.
Oh, man. I don't know. What am I doing here?
What am I doing here?
You're here to take control of your life.
You want to know something?
What the hell do you care, man?
You're rich. You're comfortable.
You got your goddamn book you wrote.
All the time you want to help me, you don't do dick.
You don't do nothing, you and your goddamn book.
It's talk. And it's just talk.
The whole thing is a con game.
You do nothing.
This doesn't help me.
You want to help me?
You want to help me?
Help me with this.
Help me with this if you can.
Because if not, I gotta use it.
To use it for what?
- Aren't you gonna ask me, "Is it loaded?"
- To use it for what?
To use it to kill myself or, you know, to--
- I don't know, to--
- Why would you want to kill yourself?
What do you think this is?
Some dream?
Man, you're living in the dream-- your questions.
- 'Cause there is a real world.
- And what happened to you in that world?
- What happened to you?
- What difference does it make?
You say you want to help. You can't help,
'cause, babe, you don't know what trouble is.
Give me the gun... and I will help you.
Billy.
Billy, I swear to you.
You give me the gun... and I will help you.
I just lost $25,000... that I do not have.
And if I do not pay it by tomorrow, they are going to kill me.
Now... what kind of help is your damn promise now?
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I need a match.
- You looking for a partner to play something?
- I'm looking for Mike.
- Who's Mike?
- Would you get him for me?
I don't think Mike is here.
Why don't you go take a look?
What the fuck is it?
I'm looking for Mike.
Mike isn't here.
What do you want?
- A friend of mine--
- Hey. Cut to the chase.
- I'm very busy. What do you want with Mike?
- I'm telling you, and you're Mike.
- I want you to listen 'cause you threatened to kill a friend of mine.
- Is that what I did?
Yes, that's exactly what you did, Mike, and that behavior doesn't go.
Whether you mean it or not.
And it's irrelevant to me,
'cause you aren't going to do it.
Now, this is a sick kid.
- He's a compulsive gambler, and he--
- Wait, wait. What is this?
What are you gonna do to me?
What are you fronting off about?
If I'm this bad dude, why don't I take out some gun, blow you to a billion parts?
I'll tell you why.
'Cause I think you're just a bully.
Just a bully?
What, you're not gonna let me carry your books?
Aren't you a caution.
Let's talk turkey, pal.
One, you threatened to kill my friend.
You aren't going to do that.
'Cause if you do, you're going away for life.
- Two is the money.
- Money?
- He hasn't got it, but--
- Who is this friend?
- Billy Hahn.
- Billy Hahn.
- He lost how much to me?
- Come on. Come on. $25,000.
$25,000 Billy Hahn has lost to me.
Excuse me one moment, will you?
You say Billy Hahn lost 25 large to me.
I'm showing you this
'cause I like you, okay?
'Cause you got blonde hair.
You're looking at Billy Hahn's I.O.U.
Okay?
- Billy Hahn owes me 800 bucks.
- In or out?
Deal past me.
Okay?
How come you made me so quick?
How did you size me up so quick that I'm--
I'm not some hard guy who's gonna rough you up or something?
- I don't know. In my work--
- What work is that?
- Well, it's none of your business.
- In or out?
Out!
Oh, it's none of my business.
Okay, then I stand corrected.
Here's the thing.
- I want something from you.
- What do you want?
- I want you to do me a favor.
- Why should I do you a favor?
'Cause if you do,
I'll forget the 800 your friend owes me.
What do you want?
Let's talk for a minute.
What is it?
- Do you know what a tell is?
- A tell?
Here. Do this.
You have to choose a hand.
You do it to me. Do it.
Bingo. Do it again.
Okay. Now, I can do that all day.
How? You got a tell.
You're telling me the hand that has the coin.
- I am?
- Yes.
- How?
- It's not important.
Okay. You're doing it with your nose. You point your nose slightly at the hand that has the coin.
Okay? That's a tell.
Now, look back over my shoulder.
A guy in a beard, in a cowboy shirt--
- Do you see him?
- Yes.
He's from Las Vegas. He's been beating me all night. He's got a tell. Okay?
When he's bluffing, okay, he plays with his little gold ring.
I caught him doing it.
And he knows I did, so he stopped.
He's conscious of himself.
- I want you to do me this favor.
- What's that?
I want you to be my girlfriend for a while, come in the game.
You stand behind me, watch me play.
We get in a big hand,
I-- I go to go pee.
You watch this guy and tell me... does he play with his gold ring?
Then I know he's bluffing,
I win the big hand... and I forget the 800 your friend owes.
If you're such a good gambler, how'd you fall into this bind?
- Who told you I'm a good gambler? I'm not a gambler.
- You're not a gambler?
- No.
- What are you then?
Look, I made you a deal.
I'll tear up your friend's marker if you help me out.
Will you do that?
All right.
Two.
Three.
- One card.
- The man takes one.
Dealer takes three.
- I bet a hundred.
- Call.
Call.
Up 200.
Here we go.
Your three... and five more.
Call.
- Pass.
- The guy's got a full house. You got two pair.
It puts you in a philosophically indefensible position.
Well, it's good that
I can joke about it, isn't it?
I'm out.
You drove me out.
A man with style is a man who can smile.
- How are you?
- I can't get a hand to save my soul.
- You having a good time?
- Never better.
- Glad to hear it.
- Out.
- I'm out.
- Damn cards-- cold as ice.
- Full house.
- New hand.
- What you do, win again?
- That's right.
If you want to win the hand, you gotta stay in till the end.
- Thank you.
- What do you gotta do around here to win a pot?
- You're gonna help me out here.
- Yes.
You keep looking for the tell.
If he plays with his ring,
I'm gonna gut that son of a bitch.
- Can we deal?
- Deal, say the losers.
Well, the man says you gotta give action to get action.
Yeah, I've heard that too.
I bet the flush, the flush don't come.
I slow play trips, and nobody calls.
- New hand. Every hand a winner.
- Budge over, will ya?
- Ante up.
- Everybody stays. Everybody pays.
Here they come.
I bet 50.
I call.
And 50 back.
Fold.
100, and 200 more.
I call.
200. I call it.
Cards to the players.
Three good players.
Mike?
One card.
Al?
One moment. I'll take three.
One card.
I pass.
What's the pot?
Two, four, five-- $800.
That's my bet.
I call it.
You call.
You only call?
Well, let's go visit Mr. More.
Your 800... and I raise 2,500 bucks.
I can't stand it. South.
I'm going south.
South Street Seaport, the man says.
He can't stand the heat.
He can't stand it.
You want to play cards?
The bet is two and a half thou.
The bet? I'll tell you what the bet is.
Your 25... and I raise you $6,000.
You son of a bitch!
You've been steamrolling over me all night!
What are you trying to tell me?
One card? You caught a flush? A boat? What?
I think you're bluffing, pal.
I think you're trying to buy it.
Then you're gonna have to give me some respect or give me some money.
- The bet is $6,000.
- I know what the goddamn bet is!
I'm going to pee.
Watch my cards.
I thought you were gonna bring me luck.
Make your own luck.
- Taking change.
- Uh-huh.
And I think I might have to go to the well again.
Yes, yes, yes.
Some people say one thing.
Some people say something else.
If the man can't play, he should stay away.
His money is as good as yours is.
His money is.
Now we're gonna see about his cards.
That's right, miss, isn't it?
Now we're gonna see his hand.
How you doing, miss?
You bringing him good fortune?
Excuse me?
Who do you like in this hand, him or me?
- Leave the woman alone.
- Just making conversation.
Who do you like in this showdown here, your friend or me?
Well, I've seen his hand, but I haven't seen yours.
That's right.
That's absolutely right.
Okay, let's play some cards.
Now, the bet is what?
You're raised $6,000, Mike.
- Mike, how you feeling? You ready to take this guy's money?
- Give me a light.
- He's bluffing.
- You saw him?
He did exactly what you said.
He played with his ring.
He did? Well, he better be.
'Cause my problem is I don't have the six, and if I lose--
- You aren't going to.
- Are you sure you saw him?
He played with his ring.
Call the bet.
The bet is $6,000.
I think you're bluffin'.
What are you, Joe Hep? I didn't ask what you think. Raise, call or fold.
I should raise your ass, but I'm just gonna call.
My marker's good for a moment.
- What is this marker? Where are you from?
- Where am I from?
I'm from the United States of kiss my ass.
My marker's good.
Fuck you! And get the goddamn money up or fold the goddamn hand!
Listen, mister, this man is a man of his word. He's a regular player.
Where I come from, the rule is: you can't call the bet, you're out of the hand.
Call the bet.
I'll call the bet.
- I'll back it up.
- With what?
I said I'll back it up.
If he loses, I'll write you a check.
Who is this broad?
She's a friend of Mike's.
She's all right. Your bet is called.
Trip aces.
Beat 'em, my friend.
Club flush.
You owe me $6,000.
Thank you very much.
Next case.
Tough beat, Mike.
It happens to the best.
It happens to the rest.
I'm going home.
I'm out too.
Gentlemen.
Good night.
Huh.
I thought you had him, Mike.
I, uh--
Yes?
- He didn't do the thing with his ring.
- No, he did it.
He did? Then the fuck is he doing with a flush?
What the fuck are you doing with a flush?
That beat trips where you come from?
Give me the goddamn money.
- We lost.
- I have gathered that.
- I, uh--
- And if you think I'm leaving here without that check... you're out of your motherfucking mind.
- Hey, look--
- I'll look later. Now give me the money!
Okay. Okay, okay.
Give me a moment, will ya?
Because I won that money from you, baby.
I'll give it to you when I get to it!
Now don't get pushy!
Pushy, Jim? Pushy?
You don't know what pushy is.
Now give me my $6,000.
They put me in, um... an embarrassing position... but I'm gonna have to ask you for that money.
- That's right.
- I can't tell you how sorry I am.
No, no, no. Please.
Let's just complete this transaction and--
I think that that's probably wise.
And this check had better be like gold, you understand...
or I'm coming back here, because I won this money.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Are you all right?
Cool it, man. Just cool it.
Please. You're gonna get your money.
You know what?
I don't think I'm going to pay you.
Don't get the guy mad.
For heaven's sake, don't get the guy mad.
- Pay the man.
- You crazy bitch. Pay me what you owe.
No, I don't think I will.
And you know why?
'Cause you can't threaten someone with a squirt gun.
You slut. I can threaten you with anything I goddamn want.
- George.
- Shut up.
- George.
- What?
I think it's olly, olly in free.
- No, I'm doing fine.
- No, George. You blew the gaff.
- I have?
- Yes.
I told you a squirt gun wouldn't work.
A squirt gun would have worked.
You didn't have to fill it.
What, am I gonna threaten someone with an empty gun?
No, George, you're right.
Of course.
You guys are fantastic.
What, do you do this for a living?
- Ask her. Is she mad?
- You're not miffed at us, are you? I mean, nothing personal.
You guys were going to con me out of my money.
- It was only business.
- It was only business.
- It was only business, huh?
- It's the American way.
I don't know about you folks, but I'm starved.
Anybody care for a snack?
I told you the damn squirt gun wouldn't work.
Aces and jacks, man with the ax, suicide kings.
Well, there you have it.
A sucker born every minute, huh?
And two to take him.
Play past it.
Here.
Here's a souvenir of your escape from the con men.
You run a candy store.
This is the candy store.
Now, I come into your candy store... and I give you $20 in singles... and I say, "Excuse me, miss.
Could you please give me a $20 bill?
I have to send a registered letter to my mother."
To your aunt. It's more pathetic.
Send it to your aunt.
- To my aunt.
- And it's addressed and there's a stamp on it.
You give me a $20 bill.
Give me the 20.
And I seal it.
And you watch me seal it in the envelope.
Now, I gave you what appeared to be $20 in singles... but when you count it, there's only 19.
And you say, "I've only got 19."
I've only got 19.
Here, let me count it.
And there are only 19.
"God, I'm sorry. Let me get another dollar from my wife in the car.
Here, hold this a minute."
And I give you the envelope with the $20 in it.
And I take the $19, and I go home.
Good-bye.
And that's a little larceny called "the Flue."
- I don't get it.
- You don't get it?
- You gave me the 20, I gave you the 19.
- Yes?
I just won a dollar.
Open the envelope.
That's right.
But I saw you put the $20 bill in there.
No. That's what you thought you saw.
How did you steal the bill?
Secrets of the pyramids.
It's okay, Joe. Show her.
I think we owe her one.
All right.
The Flue revealed.
Let's do it again.
I come into your store, and I hand you $20 in singles.
And I say, "Excuse me, miss.
Could you please give me a $20 bill?
I have to send a registered letter to my aunt."
And you give me the bill, and I seal it.
And you watch me seal it in the envelope.
A little page in the history of the short con.
It's been very nice talking to you.
- Here's your cab.
- Thank you.
Good night.
May I talk to you for a moment?
My friend square with you on the $800?
Well, I thought you'd probably say that.
We struck a bargain. You said watch for the tell and you'd cancel his debt.
Are you a man of your word?
- All right. He's square.
- May I have the I.O.U.?
Hey, you're right.
What's right is right.
Thank you.
What's your name, by the way?
Thank you for a lovely evening.
You're a lovely woman.
Good night.
Come back anytime you'd enjoy some more excitement.
Let's go.
He said, "I can make any woman a whore in 15 minutes."
And what did you say to that?
I said he couldn't make anybody a whore that was not a whore to start out with.
He said, "I've been reading your mail...
and you are that whore."
Then...
'cause he didn't realize what he had done--
What had he done?
You know, I know there are people who are normal.
Are there?
Yes, there are.
- But--
- But what?
But I don't know what those people do.
It's all right, darling.
It's all right.
No. It's not all right.
It never was all right.
How can you live when you've done something--
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
Shh.
Inhalation therapist to Room 316.
Inhalation therapist, Room 316.
Maria. I have to talk to you.
Uh, you excuse me?
Thank you.
Why do we listen to their troubles when we can't help them?
Oh, you have been talking to your murderess.
I know why she is in the hospital.
She's sick.
The question is, what am I doing in there?
It's a sham. It's a con game.
Nothing that I say will help her.
And there's nothing I can learn from her to help others avoid her mistakes.
That poor girl. All her life, my father tells her she's a whore, so all her life--
- Your father?
- I'm sorry?
You said your father says that she's a whore.
- I said "my father"?
- Yes.
You remember what your friend told you yesterday?
Don't work so hard.
Do something that gives you satisfaction... something that you always enjoy.
What do you really enjoy?
- What do I enjoy?
- Yes.
I enjoyed writing my book.
Well, then write another book.
And in the short term, you come to my house for dinner tonight. Will you do that?
I'm sorry. I can't come tonight.
Now, tonight you, uh--
Forgive me for asking.
You have something to do that gives you enjoyment?
Yes, I think so.
Ah, that's good.
You need joy.
Mm-hmm.
You come back to play some pool?
- I'm looking for Mike.
- Mike ain't here.
Try down at Charlie's.
Thank you.
Inside I'm crying
- 'Cause this true love stopped for you
- Help you?
- But not for me
- Drinking?
Scotch and water.
Alone at home
I sit and stare
Afraid to leave
- 'Cause you'll
- There you go, gentlemen.
Be there
When you walk by
I stop and cry
I turn away
So you won't see
When true love ends
You say we're friends
- Scotch and water.
- Thank you.
- You pay now.
- How much is it?
Well, like most things, it's negotiable.
Oldest trick in the book.
Never fails.
Not good for much of anything, but still of great historical interest.
- Hiya.
- Hi.
It's good to see you. Did I ever tell you my name?
My name is Mike.
- Glad to meet you.
- Well, I'm glad to meet you too.
- I have a proposition for you.
- And what's your name?
Listen to this. How would you feel if someone were to do a study of-- a study of the confidence game?
And someone were to talk to you and learn your views and watch how you operate?
- A study of?
- Yes.
- For what?
- For my own reasons.
- What are you, a journalist?
- I'm a writer. I'm a sort of writer.
You're a sort of writer, and that's why you came back here? To write?
- How would you feel about that?
- What did you come back here for?
I came back here to write.
I came back here--
- I would like to see how you operate.
- Is that the idea?
You want to see how a true bad man plies his trade?
Yes.
All right.
- You'll call me when it comes in?
- Yes, sir.
Thank you.
The basic idea is this.
It's called a confidence game. Why?
Because you give me your confidence? No.
Because I give you mine.
How do you get money when you have no money?
Watch closely.
This is called "short con."
Would you please check again, please?
Howard. Martin Howard.
- Money order for $300.
- It hasn't come in yet.
- As I told you, sir, the moment--
- It was supposed to arrive this afternoon.
- The moment it arrives--
- All right, all right. Thank you.
I'm expecting some money.
- Sergeant John Moran.
- One moment. Moran?
- Yes, sir.
- No, I'm sorry. It hasn't come in yet.
They told me definitely by 9:00.
If you'll have a seat,
I'll let you know the moment it arrives.
Thank you.
Can you beat that?
Can you beat this? I've been waiting here since-- honey-- since 3:00 this afternoon.
No.
3:00 this afternoon.
I got my car stolen, my wallet.
The kid's in the hotel room, hasn't eaten since noon.
- They told me I'd have my money by 9:00.
- I swear to God.
I've got to pick up a bus ticket.
- When's the bus leaving?
- Not till 6:00, but I gotta pick up the ticket.
- Where you going?
- Back to Pendleton.
You're in the corps?
Joe, I was in the corps.
- When were you in?
Yeah, I was there.
- Marty Howard.
- John Moran.
John.
- Okay, look. What do you need for the bus?
- Forty.
When my money comes in,
I'll give you the 40. Go back to the base.
- No, I couldn't take that.
- The hell. What are you gonna do, miss your formation?
I'll lend you the 40.
When you get back to the base, send it back.
- Um--
- No, you get on that bus.
- Thank you.
- Nothing to it. You'd do the same for me.
- If my money comes in first, you take--
- No, we'll be all right.
- Uh-uh. No. If my money comes in first--
- No, I couldn't do that.
Moran.
Can I see some I.D., please?
Thank you.
Now that man is going to give his money to a total stranger.
Now, you've got to take some money from me.
I want you to take it.
- What do you need?
- No, we'll get by.
No, wait.
You tell me. What do you need?
I've got it right here.
Save your money, Joe.
Semper Fi.
What's more fun than human nature?
- Well, you learn something new every day.
- Ain't it the truth?
- You impressed?
- So you can't cheat an honest man.
That's probably true... but what we've just seen is the operation of a slightly different philosophic principle.
- Which is?
- Don't trust nobody.
Were you in the marines?
You see, everybody gets something out of every transaction.
I give that guy my confidence.
I ask him for help.
And what he gets is he feels like he's a good man.
Now, what do you get out of this transaction?
- I told you.
- Did you?
Yes, I said that I wanted--
You want to know a tell?
I'll show you another one.
Give me your hand.
Think of a finger.
Think of one.
- You're thinking of one?
- Yes.
Okay.
I'm gonna tell you which finger you're thinking of.
Do you think I can do that?
- This one.
- Yes. How did you know?
How did I know?
'Cause you were thinking of it.
- Do you want to make love with me?
- Excuse me?
Because you're blushing.
That's a tell.
The things we think, the things we want... we can do them or not do them, but we can't hide them.
What is it you think I want?
I'll tell ya.
Somebody to come along... somebody to possess you... to take you into a new thing.
Would you like that?
Do you want that?
Yes.
What is it?
Yes.
That's good.
- Good evening. May I help you, sir?
- A room.
- Your name, please.
- Richard White.
Mr. White.
- You have a reservation?
- No, I don't.
I'm sorry, Mr. White, but the entire hotel is booked up with the apparel show.
- Good night.
- Good night, Mr. Dean.
- You have nothing?
- No, I'm sorry, we don't.
Who's that man?
Is that the manager?
Uh, no, sir. The manager is away from the desk at the moment, but I assure you that the hotel--
That's all right. Thank you.
- I'm sorry. If you could just check back--
- That's perfectly all right.
What if the--
What if the man comes back?
He had on a tuxedo. We would believe he's going out for the evening.
- What if he does?
- I don't think so.
And if he does, we deal with that thing then.
In or out?
We should be leaving.
You said he wasn't coming back.
Probably not.
But why should we wait for him?
Some people would say that you're an interesting man.
I'm a con man.
That's what I am.
I'm a criminal.
You don't have to delude yourself.
You can call things what they are.
You can call yourself what you are.
What am I?
Listen to me.
'Cause there are a lot of things in the world... and there are many sides to each of us-- good blood, bad blood.
Somehow all those parts have got to speak.
You know what I'm talking about.
The burden of responsibility has become too great.
- It's true, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.
Babe, I know that it is.
I read a book once which said this:
If you're fired from your job, when you're going home, take something.
A pencil-- something to assert yourself.
Take a memento.
Take something from life.
I think what draws you to me is this:
I'm not afraid to examine the rules... and to assert myself.
And I think you aren't either.
Do you really think so?
Yes, that's exactly what I think.
I'm gonna wash up.
And then let's get out of this guy's room.
Let's get outta here.
- Taxi this evening, sir?
- No, thank you.
- I want to see you again.
- Well, I hope so.
We'll do that soon.
- I have to go.
- Can I go with you where you're going?
- Where do you have to be?
- I've actually got to be right here at--
Christ. What time is it?
- What is it?
- Look. Look.
You remember Joey from last night?
- Your friend.
- The guy in the bow tie.
Slowly-- Slowly look over my left shoulder and tell me if you see him.
Yes. He's just crossing the street.
- Oh, Christ.
- What is it?
There's a bit that I'm supposed to do here.
Okay. Okay, I'm gonna call you.
Soon.
- Let me do this with you.
- No, babe. Good-bye.
- You're getting into the frame-up.
- Let me do this with you.
No! This is not a game.
We're about to sting this guy.
I'll do it with you. Please.
Let me do it with you. Just tell me what to do.
Aw, babe, you're mucking up my timing.
Come on.
You're my wife. You follow my cue.
Whatever I do, don't volunteer anything.
Taxi!
However strange things seem, keep your mouth shut.
And the only one you know is me.
The airport. And hurry.
- Going to the conference tomorrow morning?
- Wouldn't miss it.
Wait for the light.
They'll ticket you for jaywalking.
Oh, yeah.
I've been in this town before.
- Fella left his briefcase.
- Sorry?
Fella left his briefcase.
Well, he probably came from the hotel.
Let's, um, take it back and--
Holy Christ.
Oh, my God.
I'd better get this--
I suppose I'd better get this back to the hotel.
Let's, uh--
Let's-- Let's just talk about this for one moment.
I'm with you.
Now, look, look, look.
This has got to be stolen money.
I understand.
But how do we know that?
What are you, nuts?
There's $80,000 in the goddamn bag.
- Who's gonna be carrying that--
- That's right. carrying that kind of money in a bag in the middle of the night?
- That's absolutely right.
- And--
And there is no goddamn way
I'm giving that money to the police.
- Why should we? So some cops can split it?
- That's absolutely right.
I'm not gonna do it.
And I'm not gonna let you do it.
All right, now let's just stop pussyfootin' around here.
This is the central proposition--
This money fell into our laps.
There is no way we're gonna give it back.
So we all know what we're gonna do, so let's just face the goddamn facts.
'Cause we know we're gonna split the money, so let's just do it.
I, uh--
I work in a bank.
- We don't wanna hear about your personal problems.
- Will you just shut up for a second?
Listen to what I'm gonna tell you.
I work in a bank.
If this money's clean-- If it's clean--
If it's not counterfeit, I say this--
I say we split it up.
We split it up down the middle and we walk away, and this never happened.
That's what I say.
That's what I've been saying for the last three hours.
I'll take the money to the bank.
And tomorrow--
Excuse me. Are you nuts?
Do you think we're insane?
Listen to what I'm gonna say.
We keep this money intact. We don't touch it.
I check it out.
If it's hot, we-- we sit on it for six months, a year.
- And you keep the money all this time?
- Listen to what I'm gonna tell you.
I can go to my bank tomorrow morning, here, in town... and I can get--
I can get $10,000, $20,000 clean money--
my money.
I'll give you a bank check.
I keep the briefcase, you keep my money.
- We keep your money.
- Yes.
Wait a second. Wait a second.
Back up, back up.
I'll go to my bank.
I'll go to my bank, all right?
I'll get $30,000, and I'll get the thing checked out.
I'll give you my money, and I'll take the briefcase, you son of a bitch.
Who's he think he's dealing with here, for Christ's sake?
I'm gonna wash up.
I'm gonna change my shirt, and then we'll go.
- Keep an eye on the, uh--
- Go on. Don't worry.
- You awake?
- Yeah.
- How you doin'?
- Fine.
Got a little bit more than you bargained for, huh?
- What's happened?
- Yeah.
I don't understand how this works.
Okay, I'm gonna tell ya.
The mark gets dressed.
We take him to the bank.
Don't include the broad in it, Mike.
Are you nuts? You had to drag her along?
Leave it be.
She doesn't have to know how we do this.
Be cool, Joey.
It's almost over. It's going good.
Don't mouth it. It's going how it's going.
You were a fool to have brought the broad.
Be that as it may, you make a deal with the mark.
Gets to ship the briefcase to himself in, uh--
Where's he from?
- Baltimore.
- From Baltimore.
Now, why do we let him do that?
Because before he does, he goes to a bank here... and gives us $30,000 as collateral... so that we trust him.
Just before we send him the briefcase, we switch it on him... and we've got his $30,000.
If it's phony money in the case, why do you have to switch it?
Who said it was phony money?
It's real. That's the beauty of the thing.
We're showing the guy 80,000 real dollars.
We borrowed the money from the hard guys for one night. Tonight we give it back.
How's he doing?
Changing his shirt.
We got a couple of minutes.
I hope you enjoyed your evening.
You have seen sights that few have seen.
You were a goddamn fool to bring her along.
It's over, Joe. It's all right.
You did real good.
Okay, time to go.
- Let's take it to the bank.
- Better get your jacket.
Coming out in about five minutes.
We'll be coming out in five minutes.
Not as far as I can determine.
Negative. None of them are armed.
We'll act as if they are, in any case.
Roger.
When you come in, have a female officer go for the woman...
get her down on the ground and frisk her good.
I don't know who she is, and I don't trust her.
I'll take the young guy, you take the old.
I got it.
The signal is I clear my throat.
Say again.
- And that's at the bank?
- Yes, at the bank.
- He's a cop.
- What?
He's a cop.
I heard him on the walkie-talkie.
- Oh, my God. We gotta get her out of here.
- You'd bloody better well believe it.
- Hold it. Briefcase.
- Got it.
What did we forget?
Good. Come on.
Where are you going?
- It's just my wife. She's got a cough.
- No, no, no. Hold on.
- We're gonna stay with you. She--
- Nobody goes anywhere.
- She's very ill.
- Police. Don't move.
- I told you, my wife is ill.
- Move back, get on the floor, sit on your hands.
- You're under arrest. It's all over for today.
- No.
You move, and I'll blow your goddamn head off.
I've gotta get out of here.
- Uh-uh.
- No.
How is he?
Yeah, he's dead.
I can't be here.
- Why did you have to kill him? Are you out of your mind?
- We've got about seconds to get outta here.
- A straight bitch and she panicked.
- Shut up. Go check the door.
Come on.
- Stairs.
- Go.
They're out there.
She's killed us, man.
The bitch has killed us dead.
Steal the car.
I can't do that.
Do you wanna spend the rest of your life in jail?
Or do you wanna get us out of here?
We need you to steal the car.
All my life, Mike--
All my life, I never had a moment's violence.
Never saw a moment's violence.
Forget it. Wipe it down, and let's get outta here.
I swear to God. And you had to bring your square john broad into it.
- You had to bring your trick into the game.
- Okay, okay. It's happened.
It's something that happened.
- It was an accident.
- An accident?
Goddamn you!
You broke the first rule!
I should've turned around the first moment you brought the broad!
I brought the broad?
Who brought the goddamn cop?
- Where did you get the cop?
- I found him at the apparel show.
- He looked like a businessman.
- Okay, okay. Shut up.
- He looked--
- I said shut up!
We're gonna get the car wiped down.
In a couple minutes, we'll be out of here and we're home clean. None of this ever happened.
You go home, nobody even knows your name and it's all over.
We give the mob back their money--
Where's the briefcase?
You had it.
You had it at the garage.
- You had the briefcase.
- I thought we put it in the car.
- Where is it, Joe?
- It isn't there.
- What does this mean?
- I'm sorry, Mike. I swear.
- When we were in the garage--
- Shut up. Let me think for a second.
What does it mean?
I'm sorry, Mike.
I was scared.
You were scared?
You son of a bitch! You've killed us!
What does it mean?
It means we've lost $80,000 we borrowed from the mob.
If we don't pay it back tonight, they turn us over for that cop we killed.
- I can give you the money.
- You got senile, old man.
- I can give you the money.
- I need $80,000 by this evening.
- I'll get it. I'll give it to you.
- You have that kind of money?
I can get it.
Then, for God sakes, get it.
Funny how things happen sometimes.
- I'm sorry, Mike.
- Get in.
- I'll tell 'em--
- They know what happened.
You don't have to tell 'em a goddamn thing.
Start for the airport.
What happens now?
What's gonna happen is this:
Joey gives the money back to the mob, and then he goes away.
I'm gonna go away.
You're gonna stay here
'cause you have a life here.
Nobody knows who you are.
They can't trace you.
If you don't tell them, then they don't know.
Listen to me.
You're gonna get a strong urge to confess to thievery, to murder.
You're gonna want to confess.
Don't do it.
What happened was an accident.
The fact that you were there was an accident.
You did nothing wrong.
So you go and forget it.
I--
I just wish--
Stop the cab.

Maggie.
Maggie!
What is it?
What is it, darling?
- Come inside.
- No.
- No. I--
- What?
- I have to talk to you.
- What? Anything. What is it?
You know-- You know the dream where you've done something terrible... some-- some-- and you're going to die... and you say,
"I wish this was a dream."
Maggie darling, come inside, sit down and tell me.
No. Listen to me. No.
And if you reveal yourself, you betray someone else, and--
- When you have done something unforgivable--
- Yes.
When you have done something unforgivable,
I'll tell you exactly what to do.
You forgive yourself.
It isn't as if you'd killed somebody.
Dr. Littauer?
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Dr. Ford. Do I have the wrong day?
Am I here on the--
I'm very sorry. I'm very sorry.
I'm quite ill. I have to cancel.
- Are you all right?
- Didn't I just tell you?
What did I just say?
No calls through under any circumstances.
Call my appointments for today and cancel them.
Dr. Ford?
Dr. Ford?
Dr. Ford, it's Billy Hahn.
What do you want?
I tried to call.
I had to cancel my appointment tomorrow.
They said you weren't taking any calls.
I have to go away for several days.
Yes, I think it's best if we suspended treatment for a while.
I stopped by to tell you that I would be gone and couldn't come tomorrow.
Yes.
Thank you.
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
Could I speak to Bill, please?
Right. I'll hold.
Bill. Yeah. How's it going?
Real good.
What? Oh, yeah!
Hey, well, that's really good news, man.
I'm always glad to hear that.
Yeah.
Excuse me.
I just won $5,000 on a baseball game.
How 'bout givin' me a taste?
Oh, man. I would give you a taste if you'd make a bet sometime. You're so fuckin' cheap.
- How come I always gotta play the straight man?
- Hey, man, think about it.
- Think about what?
- Sit down, man.
- Who filled the goddamn water pistol?
- I did.
You're turning into Sarah Bernhardt, man.
That water pistol made a puddle big enough to swim in.
- That's the point, isn't it?
- A taste for the theatrical.
You don't know the half of it.
He threw his arm out battin' that bitch around.
- He hit her?
- Oh, yeah.
Slam-bang on the breezoid.
He put the slam-bang on my forehead.
Look at this fuckin' bruise you gave me.
What do you pay for?
It's realism.
- So, is she gonna stand up?
- Well, like you said, she's on tilt.
But I don't think she's gonna beef to the cops.
So do you want me to send him back to have him check on her again?
No, I think she'll stand up.
Pay the kid off.
- Keep him a little scared.
- Oh, yeah.
Mike, how did you know she was gonna go for it?
Go for it?
Hey, the broad's an addict.
This is great. This is fantastic.
Listen to this.
- The bitch, when we were dressing the room--
- When you were dressing my hotel room?
- Spreading some personal junk on the bureau.
- We put some personal stuff up on the bureau.
- Uh-huh?
- Yeah?
Yeah.
- So it'll look like somebody's in the room.
- Get this. Listen to this.
I leave some stuff--
I leave 40, 50 bucks up on the desk.
Now, the broad steals my pocketknife.
- No.
- The broad-- My hand to God!
- She boosts my lucky pocketknife.
- Can you beat that?
- The bitch is a booster.
- The bitch is a born thief, man.
- So you had her made from the jump?
- I'm tellin' you, a ton of fuckin' bricks.
- "Show me some real con men."
- Yeah, we showed her some con men.
We showed her some dinosaur con men, some old-style.
Yes, sir.
Years from now they're gonna have to go to a museum to see a frame like this.
- That's right.
- Took her money and screwed her too.
A small price to pay.
We took out for the hotel-- two hotel rooms --
Speaking of which,
$300 for your hotel room?
Always show a little front.
You taught me that yourself, Mike.
Oh, you're such a flatterer.
Spend 300 to make 80,000?
Mike, you are the ringtail rounder.
- You are King Kong.
- One riot, one ranger.
- You put that bitch in the panic bag.
- Hey, baby, this is my road game.
- What's next?
- For me? A vacation.
I'm goin' to Vegas tonight on the 10:00.
You wanna come?
- Quittin' winners this time.
- Miss ya.
What did I say?
Got the two hotel rooms.
52.90 for two policemen's uniforms.
Twenty-five dollars we gave the parking lot attendant...
and 500 to the kid.
Give me a running total.
Mike-- Mike, what are y--
Why are you here?
- We can't be here.
- What are you doing here?
Listen. Listen.
They're following me.
- They're following me.
- They are?
- Yes. I tried to--
- Wait a second.
Vegas Air flight 182 departing for Las Vegas --
- Look, we can't be seen together.
- Don't leave me. I'm so glad you're here.
- You're in no danger.
- I told you, they're waiting for me.
There were men--
There were policemen following me.
What are you doing here?
I thought you'd gone.
I couldn't get on the right flight.
Now look.
If they haven't followed you here, then you have some time.
- But we have to split up.
- No, I can't.
- Yes.
- No, don't leave me.
- This is a godsend that you're here.
- I'm gonna tell you where I'm going.
- We'll meet there. We'll take separate flights.
- No, no.
No, no, no.
I'm so frightened.
And, Mike-- Mike, I--
I took all my money--
I took all my money out of the bank. I'm--
And you'll help us disappear.
We'll disappear together.
Mike, I've got a quarter of a million dollars.
We can live. We can--
I can't believe I'm seeing you.
- Do you think you were followed to the airport?
- I don't know. I'm frightened all the time.
- I saw them. I went to the bank.
- Yes, I see.
Then I waited to throw them off before I went to the airport.
- Good.
- I bought my ticket in another name.
I think that's wise.
My real name is Margaret.
Margaret.
We'll get out of this, I promise you.
- Yes.
- I'll get us out of the country.
- Yes.
- We need a plan.
I've got you.
- It was fate I found you.
- Yes, it was.
- Because together--
- Yes, we can.
- And when I saw them-- When I saw that they came after me--
- It's all right now. You're safe.
No, I knew that I was being punished.
No. It was an accident. No.
No, I knew that I was bad.
You know why?
You know when I knew?
Because I took your knife.
That's when I knew.
- What knife?
- Your knife from the hotel room.
And I said, "That's why it happened."
Yes, because I'm bad.
Because I stole.
What is it?
Mike, what is it?
Oh, you're a bad pony, and I'm not gonna bet on you.
Mike.
You see... the thing of it is, you just said my knife.
- I don't understand.
- My knife.
You said you took my knife from the hotel room.
You see, in my trade, this is called-- what you did--
You cracked out of turn. Huh?
You see?
You crumbed the play.
My knife.
What do you want?
What do you fuckin' want from me?
You want your 80 grand back?
I can't give it back. I split it up.
What do you want? Revenge?
- I gave you my trust.
- Of course you gave me your trust.
That's what I do for a living.
You asked me what I did for a living.
This is it.
Look-- Look, I'm sorry--
I'm sorry I hurt you.
Really.
You're a good kid.
Now, whatever it is you feel that you have to do--
- Sit down, please.
- I'd love to, but I--
- I said to sit down.
- What are you gonna do, go to the cops?
- I may.
- Tell 'em what? What are you gonna tell 'em, stud?
That the author of the best-selling
Driven: A Guide to Compulsive Behavior... gave her fortune away to some con man?
You see my point?
But we've had fun.
You must say that.
I said to sit down.
If you walk out that door,
I'm going to kill you.
I don't believe you.
What is life without adventure?
What?
What do you want me to do?
You took my money.
How naughty of me.
- You raped me.
- Is that what I did?
- You took me under false pretenses.
- Golly, Margaret, well, that's just what happened then, isn't it?
Okay, look, you got stung, and you're hurt.
I can understand that.
You're stuck, and you're steamin'.
I want to know how you could do what you did to me.
It wasn't personal. Okay?
And funny as that sounds,
I'm sorry that it happened, but it did.
We've all gotta live in an imperfect world.
- You used me.
- I used you. I did. I'm sorry.
And you learned some things about yourself that you'd rather not know.
I'm sorry for that too.
You say I acted atrociously.
Yes, I did.
I do it for a living.
You sit down!
You can't bluff someone who's not paying attention.
Are you nuts?
- What are you, nuts?
- I want you to beg me.
Fuck you. I'm not gonna beg you for a goddamn thing.
- Beg me.
- It's a goddamn bluff.
You're all bluff.
What, are you gonna kill me and then go to jail?
Give up all that good shit that you have?
Your best seller? That doctor stuff?
All that stuff you're trying so hard to protect?
You're gonna give that up?
It's not my pistol.
I was never here.
Beg for your life, or I'm going to kill you.
Hey-- No.
I can't help it.
I'm out of control.
- Hey-- No, I--
- Beg me for your life.
Hey, fuck you! This is what you always wanted, you crooked bitch! You thief!
You always need to get caught
'cause you know you're bad.
I never hurt anybody.
I never shot anybody.
You sought this out. This is what you always wanted.
I knew it the first time you came in.
You're worthless, you know it?
You're a whore.
You came back like a dog to its own vomit.
You sick bitch!
I'm not gonna give you shit!
Thank you, sir.
May I have another?
Are you Dr. Margaret Ford?
Yes, I am.
Would you sign my book?
I'd be delighted.
Maggie! Darling!
I missed you.
How are you?
- I'm fine. Really fine.
- Are you?
Yes, I absolutely am.
Good. Come.
I'm so happy you are back.
Now we'll sit down... and then you'll tell me everything.
Please.
Do you know how frightened I was for you before your trip?
It was just the strain.
I had my book coming out and--
No, no. I know.
But something--
There was something on your mind.
- You were--
- That's right.
And you said,
"When you've done something unforgivable... you must forgive yourself."
And that's what I've done, and it's done.
Good. Good.
Oh. Now, what are we going to eat?
What did you eat down there?
Dr. Littauer, you're wanted on the phone.
Oh. Sorry, darling.
Please order for me.
Excuse me.
Yes?
Could you tell me what that is on the buffet?
- A Waldorf salad.
- Thank you.
You don't have to start following her until...
That was the Man in Black...
...and this is WHN —
1050 on your dial...
...the home of country music in New York City.
It's a beautiful Monday here in the Big Apple...
...so if you city slickers are feeling blue...
...stay right here. 
I'll be right back.
Stavros!
Been a long time!
Long time.
My wife.
How are you doing, Mrs. Niotes?
I just got in — I have to leave!
Tomorrow, I go with him to Washington.
So take good care of my wife.
Father — Father!
Come in here and look at this!
It's beautiful...
No. You stay here. I'm flying.
You watch your mother.
Are we going to the Plaza,
Mr. Niotes?
That was Rodney Crowell — and now, real quick —
here's another newcomer doing very well — and I hear she's a New Yorker —
Christy Miller — "Kentucky Nights."
Keep it right here, Sam.
Sam who?
Well, what's your name?
My name's Deborah.
That's why I called you Sam.
Makes sense.
I'll take the tangerine if you give me a butt.
What are you, a cop?
What, do I look like a cop?
Could be — my brother was a cop.
So?
So, your brother was a cop.
Take the drive up here, will you, Sam?
Okay, boss.
Who's your friend with the beard?
You all mafia or something?
You smoke too much.
Doing a lot better.
Used to be three packs.
Your friend with the beard is weird.
I'm gonna finish a pack now.
Too much.
I know.
Goddamn things are killin' people.
I gotta stop.
Yeah, I stopped.
Your friend. he don't smoke — don't like music —
Uh-huh.
You weird, like your friend with the beard?
Me? Oh, no, Sam.
Me? I'm a charmer.
Get off up here.
I'd like to.
Oh, Sam...
Okay, Sam — I'll see you later.
I think you will, boss.
I don't know what I like better about you —
Your freckles, or...
...your freckles.
Oh, you are a —
Mmm-hmm.
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!
Wait for me, Stefania.
Oh my god! The best girls on Earth!
I knew you were coming today!
I knew it!
I knew it, too, daddy.
You did not.
<I>I was the one who said let's wait a little longer.
You didn't say anything.
But I thought it.
She thought it.
She's just lying again.
No I'm not.
Oh, you're smoking, Johnny.
Jesus — how'd that get there?
"How'd" that get there...
That's Sam, fellas.
This is Steffie.
Ow!
How's it going, Steffie?
Pretty good.
And Gina.
Howdy, Gina.
Howdy.
Gotta drive!
Yeah, go ahead, Sam.
Have a good day!
Seeya later, kids. Nice to meet you!
So long, daddy...
That a new one?
What do you think?
She's very pretty.
I liked her freckles.
Oh, did she have freckles?
Yeah, daddy — she had a lot of freckles.
Daddy noticed the freckles.
Well, thanks a lot, Stefania.
What about Christy?
Ah — Christy, Christy, Christy...
"Christy, Christy, Christy..." —
You always say that, daddy.
Why do you do that? It's so cute.
I don't know why I do that...
I haven't seen you for two days!
It's been two days, daddy!
Shut up, idiot! Stop repeating everything I say!
I'm not!
You are!
Well, maybe she has the same thought and you keep feeding it to her...
I had the same thought.
Very boring.
Daddy, can I have a pineapple?
What are you gonna do with a pineapple in school?
Who's gonna cut it for ya?
Your mother'll buy you a pineapple.
How is your mother?
She's okay.
She's okay.
She threw a jar of roses at Dad...
...I mean — at Cliff.
Roses, huh?
I don't know why I called him Dad.
I don't call him that anymore.
Don't worry about it, kid.
Mommy likes for us to call him Dad.
No? She doesn't care...
Don't worry about it! This is kid shit.
Call the guy whatever you want!
I mean — you see a lot more of him than me.
I'm the one who left...
Sometimes we wish you were together.
But then we wouldn't have met Christy or Alicia...
...or Suzanna. 
Is she still in Albuquerque, New Mexico?
Yeah, she'll be there for a while.
Christy's so funny. I like her.
I like Alicia.
I like Alicia too.
I didn't say I didn't like her.
You like Christy better.
No I don't. I like them both.
Sometimes I feel sorry for Christy, though.
Why's that, angel?
I dunno.
Christy is funny, daddy.
Christy's in love with you, daddy.
Yeah, well — I love her too.
But you're not in love with her.
What the hell do you know about it?
Women's intuition!
It's women's intuition, daddy.
Will you cut that out?
C'mon. You'll be late.
Did you finish that case, daddy?
That's why you didn't see me start a new one today.
Got a date tonight?
How about the cab driver?
Good. I don't like when you're alone.
Stop worrying. You'll get an ulcer.
I love you, daddy.
Oh, Gina, my Gina.
When can we have dinner?
How about tomorrow?
Okay. Bye.
Seeya later!
Be nice to your mother!
Good luck tonight, daddy!
Good luck tonight, daddy!
There you go again! Stop doing that!
Yo, cab!
Take me down to Wall Street, will ya?
God, she looks awful pretty in that dress.
Keep your mind on business, Charles.
Dark yet?
I don't think so.
Whatever you say, Chas.
Do you think she's gonna meet her boyfriend, or the husband, or...
We''re gonna find out. 
Come on, let's go.
Mmm, it's so hard to say.
Yeah, I think it happened once, but...
You never know...
Do you love him?
No.
Are you sure?
I'll see you later. Bye!
It's a hotel!
Good, Chas.
Can I help you, sir?
No, thank you. I'm... well, uh...
Yeah, uh, do you have...
...actually, I've eaten, so maybe...
Do you have a speciality? Or...
I could have, uh... a tomato juice...
...on the rocks, I guess.
Very good.
Unless... thanks...
Forget it. Hold that one.
I never wanna talk to her.
Wait. Hold on a second, Amy.
The gaucho just showed up.
Mrs. Martin's boyfriend.
He's got a girl with him
I wish I knew.
No. Nah.
I dunno who the other girl is.
I tell ya — I'm gonna find out.
Tell Johnny where we are, will ya?
Gotta go, kiddo.
I'll seeya later.
Yo, Mary — you got a butt?
It's Sylvia.
Glad to hear it, Sylvia. You got a butt?
Sure, why not? Something wrong with your eyes, junior?
Yeah. I'm dazzled by your allure.
Got a match?
Where ya gonna be later?
I'm busy.
With the gaucho?
Maybe. What's it to you? You know him?
No. Nuh-uh. do you?
Aren't you getting a bit nosy?
How I can help it?
Nah, he's just a friend. Rich kid.
He's cute, though.
At least I can see his eyes.
Well, the shades come off at midnight.
Where you gonna be?
Here you are, sir.
What? Oh...
Alright, thank you.
Georgie George, one of the great men —
Can I use your phone?
Sure, Johnny. Go ahead.
Working?
Nah! Never.
Yeah, honey — will you get me the Algonquin?
Honey, page Arthur Brodsky in the lobby for me, will ya?
Mr. Arthur Bromsky?
Mr. Arthur Bromsky?
Yeah? Yeah?
Telephone.
Brodsky.
Yeah? Hey, Johnny — what's happenin'?
The plaza? What are you doing at the...
Oh yeah? Really?
Not much.
Ms. Martin's just leaving with her boyfriend.
What? Oh, not again.
Christy's not that dumb.
Tipp City, pal.
Do not worry — I'll be there.
What was that?
Johnny — no big deal.
Go, go, go!
Maybe we'd better stop leaving the boyfriend out of reports, Chas.
Boyfriend...
Four times this week, already!
Yeah, but never alone with him.
Yeah.
Until today.
That's what I mean.
I don't like this. I don't like this at all.
Easy. Easy. Good. Right here.
Thanks, pal.
He asks a lotta questions, the husband.
Is it dark yet?
Yeah, I guess.
Just one hit for me. It's gonna be a long night.
Me too.
Look at it this way, Chas —
She's in pre-bop with her boyfriend —
She's in post-bop with her husband.
If she goes into post-bop with her boyfriend, she'll be — ah -
She'll be in ex-bop with her husband. 
And if she's in ex-bop with her husband...
...the case is over — we get paid, and...
...well, then — it's every man for himself.
Yeah, it's the post-bop with her boyfriend that worries me.
Yeah, well — it's the post-bop with the boyfriend that worries everybody.
That's what we got the job for.
Chas. Remember?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Chas. Remember?
I know, I know, I know.
No, no, no, I'm going. Keep it.
I'm gonna go see Johnny.
Call me at Christy's later if you can, okay?
I'll seeya.
Hello, beautiful.
Fallen
I have no place left to go
No one to help me
I've been sinkin' like a stone
I've been callin' the blues my firstborn
And one old lonely room my home
I've been blinded by these city lights
Dreamin' of Kentucky nights
What's a country girl like me to do
I've been livin' with my foolish pride and driven by the rain
But there's nothing in this city
But the heartbreak and the pain
Now, lover
You mean so much more to me
Than livin' in this lonely town
And tryin' to be free
I've been spendin' all my time up north, alone
But those Appalachian mountains are my home
I've been blinded by these city lights
Dreamin' of Kentucky nights
What's a country girl like me to do
I've been livin' with my foolish pride and driven by the rain
But there's nothing in this city
But the heartbreak and the pain
Did my best
Can't get no rest
I tried to make these city ways my own
I tried to find
What's on my mind
I guess that country feeling's in my bones
I've been blinded by these city lights
And dreamin' of Kentucky nights
What's a country girl like me to do
I've been livin' with my foolish pride and driven by the rain
But there's nothing in this city
But the heartbreak and the pain
You're a shit.
Christy Miller, ladies and gentlemen!
Christy Miller!
I, for one, am sick and tired, honey —
sick and tired.
I'm not going to be another one of your passive ladies...
...trembling at the thought of you — willing to put up with any kind of mouth treatment — just for the glorious opportunity...
...of spending a glorious night with you... once in a week — once in a blue moon...
No, sir — not by a longshot, honey.
Nuh-uh. No way.
Unfortunately, honey, you're some kisser.
And you're very mean to me.
Very mean.
What you need is a nice guy...
...who watches every set...
...has drinks waiting for you in the dressing room...
...rubs your feet at night...
...sprays your throat...
...tells you how terrific you are...
...makes eggs in the morning...
You made eggs — once...
And I burned them.
I thought they were delicious.
Why did you look at your watch?
I didn't know what time it was!
Why? Do you have a date?
Yeah. Redhead. Tall, freckles... she's a cab driver.
She gonna take you for a ride?
A little ride.
You're such a liar.
I think...
Yo, Christy!
It's Arthur.
Sounds like it.
What is Arthur doing here?
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
Did you tell Arthur to come down here?
Why would I tell Arthur to come down here?
Something's fishy.
Come in!
Hello, Christy. Pardon the intrusion —
I've been looking for Johnny. Have you seen...
Oh, hello, Johnny.
Well, what's up, kid?
Well...
We've got a little problem.
Yeah, the Martin case. Leon is...
...furious.
He's foaming at the mouth.
He said...
If you're not down here right away, you're all fired.
Well, I guess you'd better go!
Yeah, I guess I'd better go.
I'll, uh, see you soon, hmm?
I doubt it!
Oh, sure, sure.
Hey! Where are you going?
Where are your skates?
I gotta get this guy...
Sylvia, I don't know what I'm gonna be doing later yet.
I gotta find some other guy, first.
I'd love to be with both of you — particularly, your friend Tulips...
Hey — how ya doin', Chassy-boy?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, brother...
Oh, god, thanks...
What the hell are you doing here?
I dunno. I dunno what I'm doing.
Did you smoke that whole joint?
I was just standing there...
...looking at her —
Next thing I know, I'm out here on these skates like an idiot...
Look, we're gonna get ourselves in big trouble here — you know that. I think we should take things just a little bit light.
I know, but let me kiss her on the mouth...
Oh, the husband's gonna like that one!
Oh, no, no, Arthur!
I've got that figured out!
What?
What?
You've got that figured out...
Oh, yeah! Yeah! If the boyfriend — 
shit...
Yo, Chassy — what are ya doin'?
Better take yourself a little break here or something...
I'll be right back.
Yo, Tulips!
You two know each other?
Huh? Who? Her? No.
Well — Sylvia — Tulips, this is —
What's your name, again?
Quite a maneuver...
Not bad, huh?
Just give him your name, kid.
He's tenacious as hell.
They call me Barbara Jo.
Hey, Barbara Jo, what do ya know —
How about a lil' skate — c'mon, let's go!
Are you okay?
I'm very well, thank you. How are you?
Sam, Sam, the ice cream man.
How was your day, kid?
I'm starving.
Yeah? What did you have in mind?
I'm not particular.
Frozen pizza?
Well...
I am a little particular.
Yeah, well, I know a little French joint.
Sounds chic.
Chic, it ain't.
Deborah! How ya doin'?
Fine. Fine.
Creep.
Friend of yours?
Briefly.
His heart is broken.
Did you see it all over his sleeve?
You think so?
I can see why, too.
You're just a romantic.
Yeah? What's wrong with romance?
Nothing wrong with it.
It's just hard to come by.
Never had much of that, eh, kid?
Not much. I just don't like sleeping alone, I guess.
Gotta bundle! Why don't you bundle?
Why would I bundle?
Yeah! Bundling.
A guy and a girl sleep in the same bed — but there's a board between them — a wooden board.
He can see her — he can hear her breathe — but he can't touch her.
What are they gonna do if they can't handle it?
They get splinters!
This line here — this is your heart line.
It shows you're very emotional.
Emotions are terrific.
Besides — nobody can help how they feel.
Uh-oh. Now here's a problem.
What's that?
You're married, right?
Right!
Well — that line's a little short.
It's weak.
But that's not what I'm worried about.
No?
There's a bad romance here.
Oh — really?
Very bad — you see this line?
It goes nowhere.
Boy — that doesn't leave me with much, does it?
Well, now — I dunno...
There's something new right here — very promising. You see this line?
It goes on forever.
Maybe that's my skating line.
Your skating line...
No — that's your true passion line.
But — it's clear of the marriage line — it doesn't start 'til —
Are you getting a divorce?
You're getting very personal, aren't you?
I'm sorry — I'm very sorry —
It's just that you've got to be clear of the — of these —
I gotta go.
You do?
Well, thanks for the reading.
Do you have a phone?
Do I have a — yeah — Trafalgar 33901.
Bye!
Can you — remember —
Excuse me —
I'm sorry.
I'm not being rude — it's just that my shoes are —
I left my shoes — and my rollerskates.
Hey, Willy — he's a friend of mine.
Let him slide, alright?
Okay, Arthur.
I'll catch ya tomorrow.
Listen — I have a knot —
Go ahead.
Go ahead. You're covered.
Oh — here.
Hey, Chas!
How ya doin'?
I'm fine! Go ahead.
Wait —
C'mon.
C'mon, Chassy.
Go!
C'mon. Make this turn up here.
Christ!
Have you got your —
Yeah, I've got it right here — gimme your foot.
I'll take care of it.
What happened? Did you get anything?
Plenty. Three votes says their marriage won't last.
Oh, sure — but what about the boyfriend?
The gaucho?
Two to one, she won't. Tulips thinks yes.
Tulips thinks yes...
Heavy no from Barbara Jo.
Sylvia's on the fence — which is where I'd like her.
Sylvia's on the fence...
...which is where I'd like her.
Seeya later, BJ — I'll call you.
Yeah — do that. I'll be home.
Good — I liked his hair.
Huh? What?
Nothing.
Here's your change — for you.
Thanks.
Heavy move, bro.
Something must have changed our lady's mind.
You think?
Chassy, Chassy —
You think?
I know.
I gotta go see Barbara Jo and find out some mo'.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What about — what about —
Stop. Smoke this — try to get some sleep —
It's gonna be a difficult day tomorrow.
She knows you now.
By the way — I met her.
Worth the wait.
Did I snore?
Bad?
Kicked?
Couple. No bruises.
No splinters.
Listen — you know where the key is.
Any time you —
...need a good night's sleep?
Yeah — that's right.
See ya later.
Hey, Ritzi — how ya doin'?
Hey, Johnny — where's Arthur?
I dunno! I was gonna ask you!
Huh — tell him to call me, will you?
I will — I will.
Arthur!
Shit.
I'm sorry, Arthur. I wasn't thinking.
Lovesick. The girl's lovesick.
I'll call you at 6:30 tonight, definitely, Rita!
She's gonna knife you one day.
Well, what can you do? It's love.
Yeah, she's gonna have to get in line — after Leon.
You too?
Why? What happened?
I called in from the gym — it's Dolores's day at the gym.
Ah, it's "Dolores" now.
He was icy.
Worse — he was polite.
I gotta get back to the gym...
What — did you spy on her or something this morning?
No, no, but it's so much rougher now.
I mean —
Yeah — Barbara Jo knows me — not as well as I'd hoped by now, but, nevertheless... 
What did you guys do, blow your cover?
No — no — but we spoke.
You spoke.
For a while.
A little while.
Long enough.
A little longer.
I figured.
But they didn't connect us.
Yet.
Well you're gonna need a beard.
A front!
Odyssey Detective Agency —
We never sleep —
Could you hold, please?
Amy, Amy, Amy.
Hi, Amy — is Leon busy?
Charlie, where the hell are the reports on the Martin case?
Oh — well —
We got 'em, Amy. Any calls?
Yeah.
Mandy —
Nuh-uh.
Sherry —
Nuh-uh.
Terry —
Terry — Sherry's sister, Terry?
The same.
Hmm. Interesting.
Any calls for me, Amy?
Just your father, Charles.
Ah — father again.
Good — why don't you call him back and ruin your day?
Oh, God.
Charles.
Hello, Mr. Leondopolous — how are you?
Where the hell are the reports on the Martin case?
Yes, well — it's been a little hectic lately, Leon.
We got 'em, Leon — they just ain't typed yet.
Then we don't got 'em, Arthur.
The typing isn't some middle-class bureaucratic curlicue.
And I would really prefer not to hear exasperation...
...in anyone's tone this morning.
Because I'm on the narrow edge of a precipice — and even the smallest additional irritation could cause me to slip over into a gaping abyss — out of which I gravely doubt it would be possible for me to climb —
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph —
Holy mother —
Shit, that burns.
Charlie?
Get the ice.
Butter —
Ice, ice — butter just fries —
Once a week, it's the same story, Leon.
Thank you. Thank you.
It's alright.
In any event — in any event —
When Mr. Martin called this morning, for information on his wife —
Thank you, Ms. Lester — for the first time in three weeks —
Thank you, Ms. Lester —
I would have been content with scribbles — on toilet paper!
Anything would have been better than nothing.
Charles — the file was empty.
It's all right here — 
I'll have 'em for you tonight, Leon.
He'll have 'em for you tonight, Leon.
Tonight's too late — I need them now.
He needs 'em now...
But I gotta back to Delores —
I could take care of all of this with Amy.
You have another call on 4,
Mr. Leondopolous.
Go ahead, Chas.
We can handle the whole thing,
Mr. Leondopolous.
They can handle the whole thing, Leon.
Well, somebody handle something.
John!
Yes, Leon?
Can I see you for a minute?
Sure. Sure — definitely.
Let's talk.
You have two calls, Mr. Leondopolous.
I'm well aware of that, Ms. Lester.
One of them is Mrs. Leondopolous...
Hello — yes?
I wanna hear every word the doctor said —
Thanks, Amy.
You're welcome.
I love your flippers — you know that?
I know that.
Odyssey Detective Agency —
We rarely sleep.
Oh, hello there, Christy.
What a pleasant surprise!
Good morning, Amy — you're looking very well this morning —
Why, thank you, Christy.
Very well.
Thank you, Christy.
Where's Mr. Russo's desk, Amy?
Do you know?
Right over there, Christy — not too far from Mr. Russo himself.
Thank you, Amy. 
I can see you're all working very hard today.
Morning, Christy — how are ya?
Good morning, Judas.
I have a few things here that belong to Mr. Russo — and I'm sure he'll be needing them a lot more than I will.
Yes, Harold — be quiet now.
Whose stuff is this, honey?
I think you've got the wrong guy.
Very funny.
Excuse me.
And Charles — how are you doing this morning?
I'm a little frazzled —
Odyssey Travel — can I help you?
Just a moment, please.
Arthur, it's for you on the travel line —
Barbara Jo.
Barbara Jo?
Hello, Jo — what do ya know?
You're looking very sexy today, Charles.
I am? Well, I'm running late — that's all —
You mean you always look sexy when you're running late?
I guess I'll have to keep you tardy...
Yes, Harold. 
Say hello to Harold, Charles.
Hello, Harold.
Okay, Jo — gotta go.
What's up?
Little rendezvous at the gym.
Uh, Christy, I have to go.
Can you gimme a lift, Charlie?
I really can't.
Well, thanks a bunch, Charlie...
I'm sorry.
Well, where are you going?
Uptown.
Well, that's where I'm going.
Way uptown...
You shave today, Charlie?
What? Yes.
Funny — from here, looks like you got a beard...
A beard?
Nope! Smooth as silk.
Oh —
Christy, where did you say you were going?
Uptown.
No kidding — what a coincidence — so am I!
Come on — I'll give you a lift.
Why, thank you, Charles.
It's been a rough day —
My toilet exploded this morning.
Is that so?
Yes — I flushed it quite innocently — you would've thought a bomb went off!
I'm just lucky I wasn't sitting on it!
Yes. Thanks for calling.
Listen — we'll have to get back to you.
I saw all that.
What did you see?
Nothing.
Type.
Shoot.
Three Mondays ago — when was that?
Oh, good.
Copious notes.
Alright, dearest. Alright.
Yes.
God.
There's a virus going around.
Excuse me — my back —
People are dropping like flies.
Well, I haven't seen anybody dropping, Leon.
I see a couple of joggers —
They'll be dropping soon.
Last night, Leon, 
I went to bed with a twenty-three-year-old.
Redhead.
I put my arms around her — kissed her — and went to sleep.
Is there something wrong with her?
Nah — there was nothing wrong with her.
Well, in that case, it must be spring.
Oh, is that it?
Well, I've been noticing a certain distant, dreamy look in your eyes as of late —
And I get the impression that your personal life is —
Yeah, well —
Sometimes we could all use a nap.
What's with that husband?
Stavros?
Yeah, Stavros — that husband.
Odd. 
That marriage is odd.
When's he leaving?
Tonight — for five days.
Does he fool around?
I dunno, really.
But then — he was always something of a ladies' man —
Actually — I haven't seen him for fifteen years.
This is his second wife;
I knew the first one.
The guy believes in marriage...
Don't we all?
Yeah, that's right.
Well — I'm gonna take the kid with me.
You gotta go easier on your back, Leon.
What's that supposed to mean?
It's supposed to mean you gotta go easier on your back.
You ready, son?
Yeah — good enough, Pop.
Is there anything I can read?
There will be, Mr. Leondopolous.
Odyssey — we never sleep.
Could you hold, please?
Take care of his back, Amy.
The man is delicate — he's a delicate man.
Oh, I know.
Thank you, Ames...
Bye, boys.
Yes?
Just a moment, Mrs. Leondopolous — I have another call.
It's your wife again.
I left.
Where'd you go?
Anywhere!
Yes — Mrs. Leondopolous — I'm sorry.
He left for an early lunch.
Can I give him a message?
I will. Have a good day.
She's feeling much worse.
I'm sorry to hear it.
So am I.
Amy, I think John is suspicious.
You do, huh?
He keeps making jokes about my back.
Well, he's probably right — we're overdoing it.
You think so?
Why don't you stop right here, driver?
That'd be fine.
Okay, Mac.
Here — keep it — thanks a lot.
Charles, you certainly are the most
impulsive man I've ever met!
Repulsive, did you say?
Im! Impulsive, Charles!
I don't think you're repulsive at all!
No, I just thought you might like some orange juice or a hot dog —
I think you're very handsome!
Why, thank you, Christy —
I think you look pretty good yourself —
would you like some orange juice or a hot dog?
Yes — actually, I'd like a very large orange juice — yes —
A very large orange juice, please?
Are you Greek?
Thanks a lot, honey.
Besides, Charles — I thought you were late.
Uh, no, Christy — my watch is fast —
Would you like to take a walk?
Why don't we cross the street?
Honestly, Charles, you are strange sometimes.
Oh, I'm sorry, Christy. would you like to sit down?
What'd you have in mind, Charles — the curb?
You sure you don't wanna come up for a little lunch, Charles?
I can't cook a thing, but I know where everything is —
Do you like eggs, honey?
'Cause I've got eggs — and there's bread, I think — is there bread, Harold? Do you remember —
Yes —
Harold thinks there's bread, too, Charles.
Um — I'm not really very hungry, Christy.
Oh, you're not?
No...
Would you like some new shoes?
New shoes?
Would you like some new shoes?
Those are pretty old, aren't they?
Well, thanks a lot, Charles! These happen to be an original '30s design — from the '30s!
That's what I mean —
Wouldn't you like some new ones?
Charles...
Here — you take Harold.
So firm about it...
Wow, look at those beautiful shoes, Harold — aren't those nice shoes?
Can I help you?
We'd like to see some of the new shoes.
Yes, but we don't sell
used ones here, sir.
Oh, that's good.
This way.
Oh — excuse me — I'm terribly —
Oh. Sorry...
Do you like these, Charles?
Huh? Oh, sure — terrific.
Do you?
Okay, I'll try 'em on — I think I'll check a dress out too.
Keep an eye on Harold, will you, Charles?
Harold — easy.
I like this one.
What do you think of these, Charles?
Jesus, Christy, what are those?
Where'd you get those? Those are very unattractive...
Oh, I hate 'em, honey.
I thought you liked 'em.
No, no —
I was talking about these boots — here — why don't you try these on?
Anything you say, Charles.
I just gotta get out of this dress — it does absolutely nothing for me...
Thanks a bunch, Charles.
He just —
Harold — I can't even let the guy keep a dog!
I cannot believe this — I'm really sorry —
Harold...
Harold — just calm down...
Hi — I'm really sorry.
Sorry — I'm Christy Miller.
Oh, hello — you're the singer!
'fraid so — The record's climbing the charts as we speak —
I'm Dolores Martin. Pleased to meet you.
Oh, nice to meet you —
Mrs. Martin, or Ms. Martin?
Mrs.
Oh, Mrs. —
And who is this tall drink of water?
José, this is Christy Miller — the country singer!
Hello — nice to meet you.
Charles! Come here!
Who, me?
Of course, Charles is like the absent-minded professor, y'know.
What? Who?
Charles.
This is Charles.
Charles, this is Dolores.
Hello, Charles.
Nice to... meet you, Dolores.
And this is José, Charles.
Charles...
Hello — who are you?
I'm Charles, José. How are you?
I am José.
Oh, good.
Nah — the husband.
The husband?
And the kid.
You think?
Mmm-hmm.
Ah, yeah — there she goes.
Hey — no skating around here.
Yeah, sure — alright.
You did say only a week, Father — right?
Maybe more, maybe less —
Maybe it depends on your mother.
Father... 
Okay — take care of your mother.
Bye, Angie.
Be good — both of you!
And the flip-side of the record is doing so well —
I think it's gonna be a hit, too.
I'm really excited about it.
Don't you think so, Charles?
I certainly do — I certainly do —
What?!
My goodness, Charles.
You really are distracted —
I was just telling Dolly about the record — how excited I am. It's fantastic — it's just been really, really rough rehearsing — but they're great. 
Don't you agree, Charles?
Charles, what are you looking at?
Uh, Christy, what time did you say
Friday night?
Eight o'clock!
Eight o'clock — fine. 
Are you girls coming Friday night to Greene Street?
You're acting awfully peculiar, Charles.
Anyway, that's Friday —
What time do you wanna meet for the night, Charles?
Oh — anytime — anytime at all is fine.
Oh, the time — we're late for class!
We'd better go.
Oh, gosh. Okay.
Bye, you guys!
Bye, Dolly — nice to meet you!
Bye, José...
Christy — Christy — here you go.
I'll see you tonight, then — okay?
Wait a minute, Charles — why don't you come up to my place for a drink?
Um — I really can't, Christy —
I gotta get back to the office —
Charles, you are tense and nervous and apprehensive —
We are going to go to my apartment right now — and I don't wanna hear another word about it!
Well, I do feel kinda tense —
Taxi!
I don't believe you, Charles!
Really. I don't.
The dog is injured —
Charles —
I'll cover the side.
Take off your skates.
What?
Take off the skates.
We should go in, you think?
We're gonna pick her up.
Oh my god.
Your father's good at this —
I'm not!
Well, it's very difficult.
Wanna try it?
What did you have in mind, Laura?
Cute.
Laura, Laura — the face in the misty light — give my son a rifle —
Give him a rifle.
Gee — thanks, Pop.
He's not really your son.
Sure he is!
He curls his hair to embarrass me.
He's an aging hippie, my son.
Finally.
Mike, I thought that was me.
I think it was you.
Thanks, pal.
What is that, bro?
You got a Polish accent, there? What is that?
Me? Oh, no — English.
No shit? Well, excuse me.
C'mon, wise guy.
Let's see a little action.
Laura, you're reading my mind.
There.
Congratulations.
Easy. Take your time, Arthur.
Easy!
Yeah, Arthur — take it easy.
It's good! It's scattershot!
I can't miss...
Well, you hit everything but what you wanted —
(story of my life, sweetheart...)
Perhaps he should aim.
What's that, Mitchell?
Michael.
Well, hiya Mike. I'm Arthur.
That's my father — that's John.
Come on, darling. It's late.
Oh, just a second.
See — you have to aim carefully at the lower part of the light.
And then you have to squeeze slowly.
I can't believe it, Michael!
You're a prince.
Prince Mike — thanks a lot for the tip.
Oh, that's okay.
Buh-bye — nice meeting you —
Listen — Mike — one other thing —
You ever play computerized checkers?
No — I don't think so —
Laura — you mind showing me and my son here some of those moves?
I've got a hunch you know the moves.
Pretty hot stuff — what do ya think?
Puzzles, puzzles.
Please — my husband has me followed.
Yeah, I know.
I'm following you.
I don't know what to say.
I don't, either.
Why don't we have lunch and talk about it?
Mmm, no, I'm sorry — that's not possible.
Oh, sure it's possible.
It may be difficult, but it definitely is possible.
Now you bring your son —
I'll bring mine.
That's not your son,
Mr. — Russo.
Michael — can we go?
Did he tell you?
Shh. Easy.
Tell me what, darling?
They're working on something secret.
Top secret.
Yes! And we mustn't tell anyone we've met them.
They're undercover!
That's why the hair.
I see.
They need our help.
You two certainly think of everything.
Come on.
Hey, Laura — I'll see you after work.
Yeah? Fat chance.
Better than none.
For the penguin.
I'll see you later.
She's in love with me.
I noticed.
Hey, Mike — got a girlfriend?
Oh — two, three — nothing serious.
Oh, you've got a stable already —
I wouldn't call it a stable —
I'm gonna follow you until you change your mind.
Well, I guess that's your job.
Seeya.
Bye. I'll seeya.
Pop?
What?
What do we do?
I dunno.
I think you'd better get your sisters.
My sisters?
Tell 'em they're working.
Yeah, yeah.
Here we are — home at last.
And don't tear around too much, Harold.
Be a good boy.
Yes, Charles, just put it right there —
Go ahead, Charles!
Relax, Charles, Relax.
Isn't he sweet?
Do you hate dogs, honey?
Because I can lock him up.
No, no! Not at all.
I'm making an album, Charles.
Do you wanna hear it?
Sure. Nice view...
Why, thank you, Charles. 
Why don't you sit down? Make yourself comfortable.
Can I get you a drink?
Yes, Harold. Now calm down, honey.
You got a vodka?
Why, we certainly do, Charles.
There a match around somewhere, Christy?
On the way, honey — but I'd imagine that cigarette's probably a year old.
Oh, that's okay.
How are you doing out there, Charles?
Is Harold bothering you?
No, no — no, it's fine.
Thank you.
Don't you just love that song?
Oh, it's very nice.
Here you are, Charles — although I don't approve —
Do you wanna lie down or anything,
Charles?
No — no —
I really don't feel too well, Christy.
Don't you, Charles?
What is it?
I think I've got a headache.
Well, that's alright, Charles —
We don't have to do anything.
Why don't we just talk?
Of course! 
Why don't I give you a massage, Charles?
Why don't I give you a Touch Assist?
A what?
A Touch Assist.
A Touch Assist...
It'll relieve all your pressure, Charles — you'll feel like a cloud in pants.
A cloud in pants?
Come on!
What?
Well, you do have to lie down, Charles.
Come on. It won't hurt.
Nice the way the music does that there, don't you think?
Very nice.
Haven't done that room yet.
Look, Charles — I've got a terrace!
Wanna step out on the terrace?
That's not a terrace, Christy!
That's a ledge!
No, really, Charles! Come on!
No — Christy — don't.
My goodness, Charles.
You really are nervous today.
Now take off your tie and jacket, sweetheart. And your shirt.
I'll be right back.
Wanna play on the terrace, Harold?
Now, Charles — I can't very well give you a Touch Assist if you're standing in the corner.
Christy, I don't think — I'm — really in the mood for —
Of course not, Charles.
I'm going to give you a Touch Assist — and then you can go get ready for tonight.
Now c'mon. Lie down over here —
Oh, isn't he cute? He wants to play.
Now, calm down, Harold. 
Charles is very tense —
He's had a hard day. 
Come on, Charles. Lie down.
Don't you wanna take off some of those clothes, Charles?
You'll feel a lot more comfortable.
No, no — it's alright.
I'm quite comfortable.
Now, that's enough, Harold.
You leave Charles alone.
We're going to give Charles a Touch Assist.
Here we go now, Charles.
Just relax, honey.
Isn't that song nice?
Very nice.
Feel my finger?
Yes, of course.
Good — just concentrate on feeling it.
Feel my finger?
Say it, Charles.
Yes.
Close your eyes, darling, and feel my finger.
Feel my finger?
Yes.
Feel my finger?
Yes.
Feel my finger?
Yes. 
Feel my finger? 
Christy, I really don't think I can —
I feel there's a lot of pressure here.
Feel my finger?
Yes, I feel it, but —
Just hold me close Charles.
We don't have to do anything.
Christy...
Put your arms around me, Charles.
Nuh-uh — none of that, now —
Feel my finger?
Christy.
Feel my finger?
Yes, but —
Feel my finger?
Yes.
Charles.
Yes?
Feel my finger?
Christy, I —
Do you feel my finger?
This is a little crazy, isn't it?
Yes. Feel my finger?
Yes. God.
What is it, Charles?
Feel my finger?
Oh, Charles...
'Scuse me, honey. 
Might be my agent.
Oh, sure. I feel much better now.
Hello? Who?
José?
Oh, hello, José. How are you?
It's José.
Something happen?
What?
Wait a minute, José —
Calm down, Charles —
He's just checking on the time for tonight — he's sending a car.
Eight is just fine, honey. 
Can't wait.
I said, I can't wait!
Wait! What?
Nevermind, José.
We'll see you tonight.
That boy is very attractive, but I don't think he understands the language.
Yeah, well — everybody has that problem sometimes, Christy —
Don't you think?
I certainly do.
Kiss me again, will you, Charles?
I really like you, Christy.
You know that?
Yeah, I know — and why don't we just keep it that way, right?
Don't you think?
Yeah, I guess.
But why don't you kiss me anyway?
It's such a nice afternoon.
Okay, right here.
Alright — let's go. Come on —
We'll get new skates — here we go —
Here we go, my gorgeous girls.
'Scuse me — are these seats taken?
Oh, by the way — have you seen Arthur?
Yeah — Where is Arthur?
Where is Arthur?!
I thought it was you!
You did not.
You did not.
He didn't tie his shoelaces!
Oh my god...
Arthur! Where did you pick these two up?
We're his sisters.
We're his sisters.
They're my sisters!
They're his sisters.
I really fell right into that one, didn't I?
I'm not saying!
I don't think she's saying —
Arthur always watches us.
Arthur's used to kids.
Are you saying you don't trust me to take care of these three midgets?
No — I'm saying I don't know who's going to take care of me.
John will.
That's what I'm afraid of.
You're not making sense, Mother.
The evening doesn't make any sense.
John is very good with women.
He has a lot of girlfriends.
Will you shut up?
C'mon — we'll drop you back off at the hotel.
Nooooo.
That's very good, Mr. Russo.
Mother, I promise we'll be careful.
You're going skating.
Yeah, we'll wait for you there.
We'll wait for you there.
Thank you, Mother.
I didn't say yes —
You didn't say no.
The kid's got a point.
Come on. Let's get a taxi.
Arthur, now, you take care of them.
Don't worry!
Taxi! Taxi!
As for you — you forgot this guy before.
Oh yeah? Well, it's not mine — it's hers.
Here you go. I'll seeya later, Pop.
I'll see you too.
Take care, kid.
Michael, take care.
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
Bye, Johnny!
Bye, Johnny!
You are unbelieveable.
Now, now, Stefania.
Why you have to repeat everything from everybody? Seriously!
I never could deal with men.
I know what you mean.
I bet you do!
No, no, no — with women.
Me — with women.
Are you saying you don't know how to deal with women?
You? That's funny.
You're a professional, Mr. Russo.
Women are your life.
Why don't you call me Johnny, or Jack, or Jake, or Harry? Whatever you want?
Am I right or wrong, Mr. Russo?
About what?
About women being your life.
Well, uh — could be so.
That doesn't prove anything.
It only really matters when you fall.
And when you fall, nobody's a pro.
Alright — what happens if a girl falls for a pro — and the pro doesn't fall back?
The girl's got herself a problem.
Anybody we know, we're talking about?
Only slightly.
Are you in love right now, Mr. Russo?
I mean — personally speaking?
Personally speaking — no.
What about you?
That's a silly question. I'm married.
That's why I asked.
Mr. Russo — promise we'll never get married.
I promise.
Promise we'll never fell in love.
I promise.
Mr. Russo, I'm beginning to like you.
Honey, if you like country, you're gonna love this place.
What? What?
It's a top country place, José —
Oh, I love this western music, you know?
You really can sing this?
She has a hit record, José — have you heard it, Charles?
Huh?
He's heard it, honey.
What?
Huh? What?
Ladies and gentlemen,
Christy Miller is in the audience with us tonight —
She thinks it's her night off, but we're not gonna have that —
C'mon up here, Christy!
Sing with us!
C'mon! Everybody sing!
Ladies and gentlemen — Christy Miller!
Now, this is funny.
What's funny?
I was gonna invite you around for a drink.
I live up here.
Ah, what a coincidence!
But I see my friend's using the place — a cab driver I know.
That's the hack.
Using — or, uh —
No, no, — just hanging out.
Oh good — I'll have a chaperone.
Where's that drink?
Over here.
Your friend's a music lover.
Very fond of music.
It's me, Sam.
Oh — I was just writing you a note.
That's Angela, Sam.
Hello — I'm Deborah.
I was just leaving.
Hello, Deborah.
What are you drinking?
I gotta work. I drive a taxi.
Yes, he told me —
I'll have a scotch.
Do you enjoy it?
How?
Oh, it's okay.
Neat, thanks.
I drive for my dad.
He had a bit of — y'know.
Oh, I'm sorry — how is he?
Oh — he's great — he'll be great.
Uh — so long.
I left the keys on the table.
Thanks for the place!
Sure, Sam. Anytime.
Nice meeting you.
Why do you call her Sam?
Because she doesn't look like a Deborah.
She doesn't look like a Sam.
She looks more like a Sam than a Deborah.
Why don't you call me Steve?
Okay, Steve —
But you — you look like an Angela.
How is that, Angela?
It means "angel," doesn't it?
Now you know why my husband has me followed —
I am a brazen woman who cannot be trusted.
Mmm-hmm. I had another idea.
Me — you reminded me of someone
I knew in school.
My eighth-grade nun.
I was in love with her.
I'm sure she was in love with me, too.
I waited for her to make the first move.
Did she?
Just now.
I think it's so sexy, having that car follow us all the way.
And how about Charles?
Is he a little smitten, or am I nuts?
It seemed a little obvious he wanted to take your friend home alone.
Huh? Oh — alone, yeah.
You're awfully cute — are you rich or something, honey?
Oh, uh — a little.
I think I'm falling in love.
Love? Do you want love?
That's right, bright eyes.
How old are you?
Me? I'm nineteen.
You're not.
I'll be twenty soon.
Mmm, well — there's no hurry, honey.
I come for a drink, yes?
You come for a drink, no.
Huh?
I have to rehearse very early in the morning.
I have to rehearse very early.
Call me, now!
Right here's fine.
Well —
Well.
I gotta go, my husband —
Yeah — I gotta get up early anyway.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Go ahead — easy.
Pumpkin, what's over there?
What are you smelling over there?
What's the matter, Pumpkin?
What is it, Pumpkin? Huh?
What is it?
Why, Charles — what are you doing down there?
I — I couldn't leave.
What do you do, Charles?
You never told me.
Uh — travel agent.
Y'know — tours — planes — trains — buses — y'know.
How — weird.
Is it? Why?
You don't look like a travel agent.
I don't?
No — you don't.
Wh — what do I look like?
I don't know exactly — but not a travel agent.
Maybe —
Yeah?
More like — someone who travels himself.
Take us to Foley Square.
What the hell are you doing?
Don't you know I'm on duty?
It's an emergency — would you follow that cab? 
Just drive — I'm sorry.
What cab?
Right up there — I'll show you — just drive, drive, drive.
I'm sorry — we're very late. 
It's okay, Mac — you need any help?
What?
No — thank you very much!
Hey, buddy —
Hello, judge — I'm sorry I'm late —
Hiya, kids — wait 'til I tell you who I just saw here —
Mrs. Niotes —
Sorry, Mrs. Niotes, this just came for you.
Thank you.
It's okay — it's from your husband.
Have a nice day.
Mother?
C'mon, let's go!
What's the matter?
Nothing, darling.
It's from your father.
He's coming home tonight.
Really? Good.
Not so good — we have to leave tomorrow.
Leave? I thought it was two weeks — it's only been one!
Well, something must have come up.
What'll I tell Georgina?
She'll be so disappointed.
What about you, kiddo?
I'm disappointed, too.
Good — then we're all disappointed.
Have a nice day, darling.
Bye-bye — see you tonight.
Don't think about tomorrow.
Where to, lady?
Oh — no, that's all, thank you.
What're you staring at, bozo?
A vision in Stuyvesant town.
They oughta keep you here — dress up the place.
Aren't we chipper?
You seen Arthur?
If I see him,
I'm gonna cut his thing off.
Okay, I'll tell him.
Five minutes, angel.
I'll bet!
Five minutes!
Angela! Hey, Angela!
It doesn't make any sense, Johnny — not after the last four days.
It just doesn't!
Where the hell's Amy?
Where's Leon?
In here.
Leon?
In here, for God's sake.
Leon.
Charles, I was trying to reach you.
Mrs. Martin appears to have left
Mr. Martin — she left him a note, anyway.
Where'd she go?
It was my fervent hope that you would have that answer, Charles.
After all, Mr. Martin is paying us for precisely that answer —
What do you mean,
where did she go?
Didn't you follow her this morning?
What is it — your day off?
I lost her, Leon.
Oh, that's wonderful news.
Up around city hall.
They just disappeared —
I looked and looked. 
Who's "they?"
She and José. They had luggage.
Who's José? Boyfriend?
Well —
I guess you could say that.
I guess I could say that?
Charles, you're not making any sense.
I want you to find out where that woman is — and I want you to find out quickly —
Because if we don't find out — it's going to be very difficult for Mr. Martin to justify paying us.
Oh, it's been a wonderful morning so far.
The Niotes case is ending.
I didn't tell you that.
No, you didn't.
Go ahead, gentlemen — find that Martin girl. What are you waiting for?
Arthur, call a few places for a new secretary.
Amy has left us.
What's with Niotes?
I thought it was two weeks.
Has to get back to London — some business thing — I don't know.
He'll be in around midnight.
They're all leaving tomorrow.
John. I'm mortified.
Oh, she'll be back, Leon.
You think so?
Sure!
I guess — you must have guessed — about —
Since the beginning.
When?
Three years ago. When.
You've known about this for three years and never told me?
Yeah, that's right.
My god.
Everybody's known.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Well — who does?
Good morning, everybody!
Hold on.
Christy, what are you doing here?
I hope you're all coming to the new show tonight —
And how about these flyers?
Aren't they nice?
The record's doing so well they're starting to spend some money.
People Magazine called for an interview!
I'll give y'all a plug.
Great in the sack, honey — but lousy detectives.
Couldn't follow an elephant up Fifth.
Girls slip through their fingers like sand.
Christy, what are you talking about?
Do you know where they are?
Why, Charles — what do you mean?
What do you mean,
what do I mean?
What do you mean,
"couldn't follow an elephant up Fifth"?
My goodness, Charles — you're very agitated this morning.
What did you have — a bad day in court?
There. Did you hear that? 
She knows where they are.
Where are they, Christy? Please?
You didn't shave today, Charles — what, are you growing a beard?
Johnny, could you help us out over here?
What's everybody talking about?
What's she got to do with all this?
Are you kidding? Christy Miller has the scoop on everybody in town.
Probably knows where Amy is.
I do.
You see?
What?
She's in the ladies' room.
Okay.
Barbara Jo's playing dumb, just like Sylvia, and just like Tulips.
Just like Christy.
Nobody knows zip, mmm-hmm?
What — are you girls in cahoots or something?
Girl, what do you think?
C'mon, honey — give him the terms.
Wait a minute.
What's she doing in the ladies' room?
Some detectives.
Well, look who's here —
Hello, Amy!
Hello, Christy.
Leon, say hello to Amy.
Hello, Amy.
Hello, Leon.
Okay, folks — I gotta go.
Seeya later.
I'll walk ya down, John.
Christy, you can't just 
leave like this —
Could you hold a moment?
He missed you.
Thank you.
It's Mrs. Leondopolous.
Could you tell her I'm not here?
You tell her.
Hello? I'm not here. I'm terribly late —
I'll call you later.
There.
Big deal.
Amy, I love you.
Well, why don't you kiss me, then?
Kiss you?
I wouldn't have — it didn't even occur to me that kissing would be appropriate —
Will you shut up?
Christy, this isn't very funny.
Arthur, tell her it isn't funny.
It isn't funny.
You'll just have to wait
'til tonight, honey — it's only nine hours —
I mean, honestly, Charles!
I wonder who they 
they're talking about.
I'll let you know.
Are you coming tonight, Johnny?
I'm gonna try, kid.
I know what that means.
Now, look here, Christy — this is my job, okay?
It has nothing to do with my personal interests.
Well, Charles — pardon me if I laugh.
Ha ha.
Bye, now!
Christy!
Better.
What?
We'll follow her.
Eh? Clever?
Right, right!
Look what I found.
How ya doin', Sam?
Can't complain, boss.
Johnny.
Another cab driver?
Singer.
Sorry to bother you, honey. 
Hello, girls.
Here — they told me I had to hand these out — they need the business. What can I do?
I've got one.
You're the singer — this is your show, isn't it?
Hi, I'm Angela.
Hi, Angela, I'm Christy.
Are you Christy Miller?
No shit?
There's some dispute about that, honey, but thanks.
I love that record you did.
Thanks, honey.
Is Mr. Russo allowed into your club, Christy?
Maybe you could take me tonight.
Is he allowed.
I gotta drive.
Can you gimme a lift, honey?
C'mon.
So long, boss.
Take care.
You too, Sam.
Thanks for the cigarette.
Thanks for the light.
See you folks tonight, but if you can't, come any time!
Bye, Johnny. 
Watch out for him, Angela — he's slippery as the dickens!
Are you slippery as the dickens,
Mr. Russo?
I dunno, but I'm dizzy.
Well, I must say you have a very good taste in women — which is more than can be said about my taste in men.
Uh-huh — where does that leave me?
Dangling miserably, I hope.
Come on — show me all the sights.
Tell me your funny stories.
And take me to your loft again and ravish me.
You talk too much, you know that?
I know that.
I can't believe you drive a taxi — you oughta be an actress or a model or something! You're gorgeous!
Thanks.
I used to do a little modelling — it's a pain in the ass, y'know?
Well, it's all a pain in the ass, honey — unless you're in love, of course.
And that's a pain in the ass.
The biggest.
Right  — where can you get me some of that?
Well, I'd like a lot, darling.
Well, I'd love a ton, boy, lemme tell you —
Yep — here they come.
What'd I tell ya?
Hang on.
You guys, don't go anywhere.
Stay right here. Stay right here! 
Where the hell do you think
you're going?
Hello, Mr. Russo.
What's funny now?
I've never had a girl at this particular time call me "Mr." before.
I haven't been called a girl in some time.
Haven't felt like one, either.
Well, you feel like one to me.
Could you tell how long it's been since —
Since you felt like a girl?
You get used to anything.
Can you?
Do you know why he has me followed?
I could guess.
Could you?
Some people figure whatever they're doing, somebody else must be doing it too.
Where'd you go just then?
Everywhere.
Got a butt?
Uh-huh.
And that's it, right?
Uh-huh.
That figures.
What do you think I am — a rat?
Let's make a swap.
A piece of news on Johnny — a piece of news for Chas.
Look at the poor sap.
He's already smoked two packs today.
What do you wanna do — kill him?
Personally, I'm also late for a little appointment.
Picking up Angela's kid...
Oh — well, let's forget about the deal —
I guess I've got no news to swap —
So, what are you doing later?
Sleeping.
Want some company?
You're welcome to the floor.
I'll take it.
You've got three chicks over there already, Curly.
What're you gonna do about them?
You got a big floor?
It's nice to meet you, Sam.
You too, doll.
Thank you!
Let's go — one-two-three-four!
Now, you don't have to worry about me, babe
Hook 'em up and head out to the places where you've been
Go ahead and fly like an eagle in the sky
When you land you'll find I'm still your friend
But I don't think I could take you back again
Where you goin'?
(Where you goin'?)
You can get there without me
So goodbye
(Go on, goodbye)
And remember
(And remember)
Though I'm setting you free
I won't cry
I won't cry
Ain't no need to bother about me, babe
Someone will come along
And he will take me by the hand
Together we will walk
Where the grass is green and new
And I'll even think about you now and then...
Dolores, will you marry me?
Okay, I will.
You will?
Well, yes — after my divorce.
Oh.
Well — okay.
I can wait.
I've seen you toss and turn in your sleep, babe
Now your dream bag's packed
You've got your ticket in your hand
When you love someone
You want what's best for them
That's how it is
That's how it's always been
But I don't think I could take you back again
No, I don't think I could take you back again
Hey, everybody! This is my fiancé!
Ain't he cute?!
I'll seeya later.
I'm watching you, Curly.
I know you are, Sam.
Aren't you a little late?
Yeah — why don't you gimme a lift?
I was thinking of that.
That's where I turn into a pumpkin.
I'm sorry we didn't see Christy's show.
Maybe tomorrow we can go.
Yeah, tomorrow — sure.
Goodbye, Arthur.
Thank you.
For what?
So long, Mike. See you soon.
Maybe next year.
Right.
Oh — Michael told you we were —
Yeah, but I knew.
I guess everybody knows.
What do you mean you knew?
I mean, I knew all this was too good to last.
I'll seeya, Angela.
I gotta go meet with John.
Michael, you take care of your mother.
How is John? Where is he?
Still undercover.
So long.
You crying, Mother?
No, darling. The wind blew something.
How are the sisters?
Their mother and father were sort of nice tonight.
I think Georgina's in love with me.
How about you?
Oh, I dunno. I love her, of course, but —
I don't know if
I'm in love with her.
We're going to write to each other.
That's good.
We'll see how it goes.
No commitments, eh?
It's better that way, don't you think, Mother?
Much better, darling.
You're listening to Benny Goodman.
It's a beautiful Saturday morning, and we'll be right back.
He's here.
Angela, you remember Leonida?
Yes, of course.
How are you?
Fine, thank you.
So good to see you again.
And you.
This is Leonida's partner, Angela —
Mr. Russo.
How do you do, Mr. Russo?
How do you do, Mrs. Niotes?
I must speak with Leonida for one minute.
Will you please excuse us?
I hope the case turns out, John.
Thanks, Mike.
You make a good double agent.
Well, I'm going to check out the action.
I hoped so much you'd come.
I also wished you wouldn't.
Yeah, so did I.
We did have a promise on goodbyes,
Mr. Russo.
Yeah, that's right — we did have.
That's okay.
We're even now.
I broke the break one.
I broke that one, too.
You break all your promises,
Mr. Russo.
They're going to leave without us.
Goodbye, Mr. Russo.
I hope to see you again.
So do I.
Goodbye, Angela. Have a good flight.
Goodbye, Leon. thank you.
Goodbye, Mr. Russo.
John.
John.
Michael?
Yes?
Come fast — we have to go.
Coming!
Goodbye, Michael.
Bye-bye.
I won't need you 'til tomorrow, John, if you feel like —
...taking a little walk? Yeah.
Seeya later, buddy.
Hi, boss.
Goin' my way?
What'd you have in mind?
Go over to Brooklyn, raise some hell?
Sounds good.
What the hell are you doing down here, anyway?
The lady.
Thought you might need some lookin' after.
Got some splinters, eh, Johnny?
Got a few, Sam.
Well — cheer up, boss.
We're gonna get drunk.
Take her off!
Giddap!
Somebody help me!
Help me!
Tom!
Cut!
- I said cut.
- That was great.
Okay, that's lunch. Half an hour.
- Hi, Tom.
- Alfie.
- Hello, Tom.
- Miss Victoria.
- You look mighty pretty today.
- Thanks. So do you.
Let's go for a walk, Tom.
Randy, bring a couple chairs.
The film's looking very good.
Afraid we may have another big hit on our hands.
- You came here to tell me that?
- No.
- How are you, Mr. Alperin?
- I didn't think so.
I just bought a sensational script called Lawman.
About a famous frontier marshal,
Wyatt Earp.
Yeah, I heard of him.
"Alperin Films presents Tom Mix,
Hollywood's cowboy...
...starring as Wyatt Earp, the West's famous lawman."
- I'll get Earp as technical advisor.
- Now hold on!
I didn't become numero uno at the box office by playing other people.
Tom, this is a very important project to me.
Fox and Chaplin are gambling on sound.
I'm betting my bankroll on you in Lawman.
What if I don't agree?
Fact is, I'll be very unappy.
And you'll have to sit out your contract.
Whers it up? March '33?
That's four years.
What are we saying?
You havert read the script yet.
I may be wrong, but I'm sure you'll love it.
Well, I'll read it.
I'll let you know in the morning.
Fine.
I wanna start shooting next month.
I still have to talk to the famous marshal.
All right, let's get back to work.
It should be educational, working with a real gunfighter.
Maybe he'll give you some pointers.
Yeah, I bet he will.
You've got the wrong end of the horse.
Depends on how you look at it.
If you was Tony Jr. Here, you'd think you got the wrong end of Tom Mix.
Here comes Alfie.
- Bye, Alfie.
- Bye.
- Did he say yes?
- No, but he will.
Where's he going?
- It's been a pleasure, Mr. Earp.
- Feeling's mutual, George.
- Mr. Wyatt Earp?
- That's right. Tom Mix, isn't it?
That's right.
Can I give you a lift into town?
On your horse?
No, Tony Jr. Ain't got no license plates.
I'm afraid you'll have to ride in the Duesenberg.
There's a press conference at 2:00.
At 3:30, you meet with Mr. Alperin.
At 4, we have a photo session.
Will he have enough time to get to the radio station by 5:30?
If we finish the photos by 4:45.
Do you have clothes that look Western?
We'll get something in wardrobe.
You look a like a Texas oil man instead of a sheriff.
- A marshal.
- Marshal. What's the difference?
Hey, here they come!
Would you ever consider acting?
Excuse me.
I'm not gonna like staying here.
Then let's find you a place where you will like staying.
Will Alperin be disappointed if I don't show up for those things?
Yeah. That worry you?
I hired on as an advisor, not a celebrity.
Well, that's it.
I lived here before I got famous.
Quiet. Private.
- Washed my socks in the sink.
- Think you can get me in?
Sure, I own it.
Mi casa es su casa.
- You learn Spanish in Cuba?
- You knew I was in Cuba?
I read about it in the Sunday paper.
- Lf it's in print, it's gotta be true.
- Absolutely.
In the Chicago Tribune they said you were in the Boer War.
- Any photos?
- No, just sketches and engravings.
Engravings? Isn't that how counterfeiters make funny money?
Cue the Earps.
- Dialogue!
- You're under arrest.
Don't kill me!
I ain't shooting!
The fight's commenced.
Get to fighting or get out.
Dialogue, Billy.
God, forgive me for all the bad things I've done.
Cut!
- We'll do the close- ups after lunch.
- All right, that's lunch.
- Was it okay?
- Okay for me.
- Was that really just like it?
- Just like it.
I want to get Tom's close- ups first.
Tom, that was interesting.
- Suggestions?
- No. You handle a six-gun pretty good.
- Praise from Caesar.
- Can you hit anything?
You gotta hit what you shoot at.
I just gotta look good.
Was that really the way it was?
- Absolutely. Give or take a lie or two.
- Mr. Earp.
Good morning, Miss Shoemaker.
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure.
Honey, I'm gonna propose.
If you don't do publicity,
I'll lose my job.
I don't want that to happen.
I'll work it out with Mr. Alperin.
I know Alfie. He won't talk until he gets his pound of flesh.
Do you mind if I try anyway?
- Okay, Mr. Earp.
- Would you mind making that Wyatt?
Sure, if you make it Nancy.
You warm an old mars heart, Nancy.
Shame on you, Wyatt, trying to pull that old man stuff on me.
Mr. Earp?
Chief Dibner wants to see you.
- Who?
- Chief of security. I'll take you.
No need.
Just point me in the direction.
Go down Main Street.
Last bungalow on the left.
- Sounds easy. Thanks, officer.
- You're welcome.
Hey, Wyatt.
- Where you headed?
- Chief Dibner wants me.
Hold on a minute.
- Make him come to you.
- Why?
Because he's a dangerous son of a bitch.
You know what they say about bearding a lion in his den.
Sometimes the same thing applies to dangerous sons of bitches.
You could've made a hell of an actor.
Marshalling and acting arert too far apart.
One time, I wasrt packing my six-gun, and Doc Holliday was drunk.
He was roaring he was gonna shoot my earlobes off.
I went for a hideout gun.
Luckily, he thought I had one.
- Is that the truth?
- Oh, every word.
Give or take a lie or two.
Watch yourself, amigo.
It's just a Western.
Some Indians die, big deal.
- Watch your step.
- Michael, please!
Hold on.
Excuse me, but you're in the way of some very dedicated drinking.
Well, I'm sorry.
Hey! What picture are you in?
I'm not.
- Well, then who are you?
- Name's Earp.
Wyatt Earp?
Well, I'm Billy the Kid, and she's Calamity Jane.
Mary Jane Canary was a dear woman, but she looked like an unmade bed.
- This young lady's much too pretty.
- Thank you, Mr. Earp.
Mr. Earp is here.
I'm Marvin Dibner.
Well, have a seat.
Apparently, Mrs. Alperin knows you're here in Hollywood.
Mrs. Alperin would like you to pay a call on her as a favour.
You know who she is?
Did you ever meet her?
- You don't say much, do you, Wyatt?
- No, I don't.
Also, it's Mr. Earp.
Or Marshal, or even Earp.
Not Wyatt until I tell you.
And while I think of it...
...don't ever question me again.
Just trying to be friendly.
You're trying to stay ahead of the game.
Your boss's wife wants to talk to me, you want to know why.
Probably your boss does too.
My job is to get curious about anything involving Mrs. Alperin.
- You know what she wants?
- Why not ask Mrs. Alperin?
What's bothering you?
Your bad manners and the fact you don't hear too good.
I told you not to try questioning me.
And I meant it.
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Mr. Earp.
- Can I help you?
- With what?
First off, don't ever crowd anybody unless you got a first-class reason.
Did you do a lot of time, boy?
- Where?
- Folsom.
For what?
Armed robbery.
Make a move, it'll be the mistake of your life.
- Am I clear?
- Oh, yeah.
- Yes, sir?
- Marshal Earp to see Mrs. Alperin.
If you'll follow me.
I'll inform Mrs. Alperin that you're here.
Not much like Denver.
Mr. Earp, thank you for coming.
- I've hoped to see you again.
- I wanted to hear from you.
It wouldn't have been fitting.
I didn't think you'd remember.
You've never been forgotten.
You are just as I remember.
Perhaps taller.
- Is it possible that you grew?
- Not likely.
Then there can only be one explanation.
I was wearing high heels.
You were. Soft, gray kid high-button shoes.
- How could you remember?
- I undid them.
- The buttons were yellow ivory.
- Whalebone.
That night in Denver, you said...
That if you were ever in trouble,
I'd come.
Let's go outside where we won't be interrupted.
Alfie told me you were here, and everyone else is afraid.
- Afraid?
- Of each other. Of...
Of your husband?
Yes, I suppose so.
They're afraid Alfie might not want me helped.
With your son?
I met him today at the studio.
- Was he...?
- Drinking? Yes.
I received a letter from a woman
I used to know named Candace Girard.
She runs a place called the Candy Store.
She says Michael hurt one of her girls and I suggests I buy her off.
- What was the girl's name?
- Rhonda Lopez. Please see her.
I've no one to turn to.
I'll pay anything.
I'm not for hire. I'll do it for the way you held the roses.
Christina Alperirs a very lovely lady who married the wrong man.
Easy to understand.
When she met Alfie...
...he didn't want to take over the world.
He was still "The Happy Hobo" that people laughed at and loved.
I'm here to tell you, Wyatt, when he wanted to be...
...he could be the most charming, considerate...
...giving, funny man.
Especially when he wanted something.
He sure did want Christina.
Arert you hot?
It's open.
- The press awaits.
- Better get her done, pardner.
I explained that you have pressing engagements and must be done by 6:30.
- How did you know that?
- I didn't.
Tom's taking me on a tour.
Starting with Graumars Chinese and ending up at the Candy Store.
- Good evening, Mr. Mix.
- Cheryl.
Allow me to introduce Mr. Wyatt Earp.
- The real Wyatt Earp?
- Yes, I'm not dead yet.
I can see that.
Promise not to close us down like the saloons in Tombstone.
- I never closed a saloon in my life.
- Good.
- We know what Tom drinks.
- I'll have...
No, let me guess.
A Waterfill and Frazier...
...and a cold Dos Equis to chase.
Close enough.
- How long do you plan to be in town?
- As long as I find it interesting.
- We'll do what we can to keep you.
- I think that'd be nice.
- Cheryl.
- Miss Alperin.
Victoria Alperin,
Alfie's kid sister, and...
Dutch Kieffer.
I'm surprised a marshal knows the Chicago underworld.
East or West, a crook is a crook.
Did Tom tell you that our ladies all look like famous movie stars?
Greta? This is Mr. Wyatt Earp.
- It's a pleasure, Mr. Earp.
- My pleasure, Ms. Garbo.
Amazing resemblance.
Yes, and besides Greta, we have Janet Gaynor, Pola Negri...
...and the Gish sisters.
I forget you're here on business.
Mrs. Alperin wanted me to talk to Candace Girard.
I see. About the girl that Michael beat up?
Yes.
You'll find Candace in the guest cottage.
That's where she lives and sometimes entertains.
Use the back door.
Tom knows the way.
Will you be here when I get back?
Depends on when you get back.
How you doing, pal?
Hiya, big boy.
Honeysuckle.
- You arert what I expected you to be.
- What exactly did you expect?
I don't know, exactly.
A little less civilized.
You're not exactly what
I expected you to be, either.
What exactly did you expect I'd be?
Taller, maybe.
Candy! It's Tom Mix, honey.
Candy!
- Cadillac Eight.
- Recognize it?
No.
I got a lousy feeling about this.
Yeah, I got the same lousy feeling.
Candy!
Candy?
Oh, shit.
- Michael Alperin.
- Yeah, we met. Get the car.
Candy! Open up, it's important.
- It's a raid.
- Where's the car?
- Killed her!
- What's going on?
- What happened?
- Don't go in there!
- No! No!
- Cheryl, come on! Cheryl!
Tom! Get your hat and close this door!
- Cheryl! Shut up!
- No!
Cheryl! Listen to me!
Listen to me! Listen!
Get down! Get down!
Pull yourself together.
Go in there and keep your mouth shut.
Come on, Tom!
- I didn't know you could drive.
- I can't.
Hey, look out!
Close that door, honey.
- Get him undressed.
- Will you tell...?
Candy Girard was murdered.
They're looking for Michael.
We gotta keep him here.
- He did it?
- I don't think so.
- I killed her.
- He disagrees.
He's drugged.
- You mean drunk.
- That too. He's gonna be sick again.
Towels!
- You sure about her?
- Real sure.
- That's sure enough for me.
- Honey, come on.
Wait, wait.
- We gotta go. Can you handle this?
- Sure, I'll just pretend he's my ex.
- It's gonna be a couple of days.
- I'll manage. I'll call in sick.
I'll call you as soon as I get home.
Tom, come on.
- What if he decides to leave?
- Where is he going without his pants?
I killed her.
God, I hope you're lying.
Wyatt.
I'm okay.
I'm all right.
Will you sleep with me?
I'm old enough to be your father.
You're old enough to be my grandfather.
Now answer the question.
Yes.
I just need to be held.
At one time or another, we all do.
- Why did you tell Cheryl where I was?
- She asked me.
I figured if she asked, you'd tell her.
- Was I wrong?
- Nope.
Grand girl.
A grand 26-year-old girl.
Could've done myself permanent injury.
- How many men you killed?
- How many cars you got?
- About 16.
- You got more cars.
Mr. Mix!
Captain Dibner wants you and Mr. Earp to report to his office.
Mr. Mix and Mr. Earp.
Wyatt Earp, Captain Blackwon'th, P.D.
Tom, you know him.
Have a seat.
You boys were at the Candy Store last night.
- Was we?
- Guess we was.
Candace Girard was killed shortly before you left.
- Did you know that, Wyatt?
- Yeah.
- Dib, you got a drink?
- Yes, sir.
I'm a tequila man.
Waterfill and Frazier.
You saw a girl. Cheryl.
Gotta hand it to you.
You sure are up on things.
We need to talk to her.
She was...
...close with Candy.
Real close.
Maybe you'd talk at headquarters.
So far, you've been telling us things.
Ask questions, you'll get answers.
What do you know about Candy's murder?
Very little.
Practically nothing.
No idea who killed her?
- Could be the man in the black Cadillac.
- What black Cadillac?
The one that drove out of the alley.
- Licence number.
- I forget.
Yeah, I forget too.
Well, if I was you,
I'd damn well try to remember.
You'd have trouble remembering when you get pushed hard.
Let me give you an example.
Why did you raid the Candy Store?
It was engaged in the practice of prostitution.
That's illegal here.
Come on, captain.
Candy's been around a long time.
It's a gold mine.
To stay open, she had to be paying someone a lot of juice.
I don't know. That's not my department, that's vice.
Well, there you go.
That's the way it is in the big city.
Everybody's in another department.
All nice and legal.
Tell me, captain. With all those different departments...
...have you got a department that looks into crooked cops on the take?
See?
Sometimes you get pushed too hard...
...you got a tendency to forget.
Afternoon, Dib.
You're not gonna let him get away with that?
No.
What are you gonna do?
I don't know...
...but I'm gonna love it.
Get out of town, Earp.
- Smile when you say that, pardner.
- Oh, yeah?
Cut! That was great.
How'd you like it?
It was real thrilling...
...but I've never been in a fight like that.
- And Buffalo Bill didn't kill Injuns.
- You're right.
Bill was good, but not as good as his publicity.
Like a movie star cowboy I know.
I get the feeling you're not comfortable being a famous movie star.
What if I told you when Roosevelt was charging up San Juan Hill...
...I was in Muskogee busting broncs.
I'd say that you and I are whole lot alike.
Part fact and just enough fiction to sell newspapers.
Nobody's comfortable being anything.
I think the trick is to know the fact, and don't believe the fiction.
Tell me about Blackwon'th.
Known as "Dirty Bernie."
Not a nice piece of work.
- I think he'd like to kill one of us.
- Which one?
Maybe both.
If it's me, I'm counting on you to avenge me.
- Waterfill and Frazier?
- Oh, no. Too early.
Says you. This morning,
I need some help.
Do you know Rhonda Lopez?
- The girl Michael beat up?
- Alleged to have beat up.
Met her once or twice.
Can't say I know her.
- Tom!
- Where's Michael?
Gone. I tried to stop him but he left.
- In his underwear?
- No, in your pajamas.
- What's that?
- Tequila.
You know I don't drink tequila.
He called a cab.
I tried to reach you.
- What cab company?
- Checkered, I think.
- Know where he went?
- No. Can you find out?
Maybe. We gotta be careful.
We don't want the cab company calling the police.
What the hell did you run into?
Mr. Alperin wants Mr. Earp to have lunch.
I'm sorry we couldn't meet sooner.
I've had meetings all week.
Twelve, sometimes 15 hours a day.
Couldrt even have lunch till now.
You must enjoy your work.
Most of the time it's a real challenge.
Keeps me on my toes. Keeps me young.
- Have you seen any of my pictures?
- A few.
My biggest problem is staying in shape.
Not like it was when I was an acrobat.
These days I have to steal time just to work out.
I've found that a strong, agile, average man...
...can nearly always beat a strong, clumsy, big man.
Now, you take, for example, Arthur.
Remember Arthur, who was unsuccessful in preventing you from seeing my wife.
Please, don't misunderstand me.
I'm not opposed to you seeing my wife.
I'm opposed to people not doing their jobs. It was Arthur's job to stop you.
Even if he knew I was expected?
But he didn't. That's the point.
So the strong, agile, average man...
...showed the strong, big, clumsy man.
The error of his ways. Exactly.
- He must love his job.
- He has no choice.
He's on parole to me.
There is nothing more important than the welfare and safety of my family.
Which brings us to the reason that you saw my wife.
- She asked you to help Michael.
- Did she tell you that?
I've been told the police suspect that he murdered Candace.
If you really want to help, get him to turn himself in.
I'll try.
Good.
Where is he?
Why would I know?
You were at the Candy Store.
I presumed you helped him.
To hide, to get away?
If he did kill Candace Girard, that would make me an accessory.
I did see another member of your family.
Your sister Victoria on the arm of Dutch Kieffer.
What is it that you want?
To do whatever I can to help Christina.
Why?
Because she asked.
That's okay, we've gotta go anyway.
How are you?
- Call me.
- And me too.
I got a favour to ask you.
I want you to tell Dirty Bernie to lay off Wyatt.
He won't listen.
You don't want Earp to blow down
Alfie's house of cards.
Expose him for what he is.
- Just how would he do that?
- Wanna find out?
Turn down my favour.
Pick your ass up out of the chair.
You'll find out.
Go ahead, Marvin.
Take that chance.
- I'll see what I can do.
- Not good enough.
Either do it or don't.
Get it?
Have a nice day, Dib.
How was your lunch?
The man is crazy.
Underneath all that happy lovability and charm is a brutal sadist.
- How come nobody spotted it?
- It's been spotted.
Nobody's proven it...
...although it's a topic of conversation in the industry.
I've got some bad news.
Michael has been arrested and booked...
...for the murder of Candace Girard.
They'll locate the cab driver who picked him up.
- Lf they tie you in, you're in danger.
- We gotta get you out of town.
- Go to the ranch.
- And don't go home.
Let me borrow your car.
What's the next move?
- What?
- He don't know how to drive.
This time I gotta stop you.
Tell him to go to hell.
I'll talk to the parole board.
- They'll listen to him.
- He's worse.
- Nothing's worse.
- I gotta see her.
Mr. Earp, please come in.
I'll explain to Mr. Alperin.
Tell your boss I pulled a gun on you.
Tom called.
He said you were on your way.
- Tell me about Michael.
- You all right?
- Did he do it, Wyatt?
- I don't think so.
- Will you help him?
- I'll try.
There's something else.
It's not just Michael.
- What is it, Christina?
- Please!
If I knew you were coming to see
Christina I'd have given you a ride.
I asked him to come by.
Saved you the trouble of pulling that gun on Arthur.
Darling, shouldn't you be in bed?
I'm much better.
Christina took a nasty fall.
Luckily no bones broken, huh?
The doctor recommended that she stay in bed for the next few days.
I know how worried you are.
You've simply got to take more care of yourself.
Now, go on.
Back to bed.
I'm sure Mr. Earp will understand.
Thank you, Mr. Earp.
I'll be up shortly.
You know, Mr. Earp...
I considered you a good investment...
...but lately you've become more trouble than you're won'th.
If anything happens to Christina...
...you're gonna have to come up with a new definition of trouble.
What am I gonna do for clothes?
We'll get you the clothes you need.
Asunciòn will get you what you need.
- Asunciòn?
- The housekeeper.
- Don't leave, you understand?
- I do.
- This is serious.
- Okay.
Get in.
- Filled with gas?
- Yes.
Check to make sure nobody's following you.
This baby could outrun anything on four wheels.
It's hard being in competition with a horse and 16 cars.
I'd rather be with you than any car.
What about your horse?
- Don't answer that.
- Get her going, George.
- What are you gonna do without me?
- Whatever I can.
Bye.
Candy's my mother.
She thought I looked cute and provocative in mers clothing.
She knew people would assume we were lovers.
And...
And I wouldn't have to entertain.
I expect that's why Dirty Bernie's looking for me.
It's Candy's customers.
Various notations on their lifestyles and preferences.
Who is "Hellman, Robert"?
The mayor.
Enough in here to get a lot of important people in a lot of trouble.
You knew about most of these things?
Yes.
According to this,
Michael's a lot like his father.
No, not really.
Michael's basically passive unless he drinks.
But, Alfie...
He enjoys hurting people.
There are some interesting things...
...about Dutch Kieffer and Victoria.
Yeah.
She likes women, and he likes to watch.
You're a long way from Tombstone, marshal.
Where can I find Dutch Kieffer?
We//, you cou/d try the Kit Kat C/ub.
- There you go.
- Thank you very much, sir.
Hi, Tom.
May I take your hat?
Who the hell let you in?
Ladies.
- The door was open.
- There's a doorbell.
I rang it.
- Nobody answered.
- You could've knocked.
How well did you know Candy Girard?
What the hell business is it of yours?
You may not like this, Victoria...
...but I'm making it my business.
My houseman was the Australian light heavyweight boxing champion.
He'll kick your ass all the way to Pasadena.
- Well, in the meantime...
- There is no "in the meantime."
You were there the night she was murdered.
So were you.
So were a lot of people.
So what?
You think your nephew killed her?
How the hell do I know?
In case you hadrt noticed,
Michael's a serious lush.
When he's drunk, he's been known to beat up women.
Maybe that's what happened with Candy.
Maybe he lost control and killed her.
Maybe.
As anybody could see, you're all broken up about it.
Son of a bitch!
Somebody with a real bad temper killed Candy.
Hurt him. Really hurt him.
I recognize you.
You're Tom Mix, the movie star.
I hear you've sparred with Jack Dempsey.
Come on, mate.
Let's see what you've learned.
- Marquis of Queensberry?
- Yeah, okay. Marquis of Queensberry.
I gotta go look.
- Come on!
- Smash his face in!
Damn you!
Son of a bitch!
- Marquis of Queensberry?
- Yeah.
Compliments of Mr. Jack Dempsey.
Ladies.
You wait till I tell my brother!
You'll never work in this town again!
The guy is still out cold.
You sure?
Well, I kicked him.
He didn't seem to mind.
He knows it was your Cadillac.
He knows you were at the Candy Store the night Candy was killed.
You better figure out what to do with him.
I know what.
I just havert decided how.
I'll be home.
When you're finished, call the station.
Get the car and then give us a hand.
There's no "us." I'm out of this.
You just give advice, huh?
In this case, right.
In this case, wrong.
You're in this up to your badge.
You stop playing, you're gonna end up in somebody's meat locker.
- You can't intimidate me, Dutch.
- The fuck, I can't.
- You have a cat?
- Not that big.
Trespassing. Assault.
- That can get you hard time.
- Not if I shoot the witnesses.
I doubt you will.
You had me whipped and tied like a calf ready to be branded.
Yeah, I did that.
You broke in. I don't know you.
I know who you are, Dutch.
If I was some unknown trespasser...
...you'd have called the police instead of tying me up and leaving me.
That's Captain Blackwon'th.
I know who he is.
Then do what you gotta do.
I'm gonna call your bluff and walk.
When Captain Blackwon'th recovers...
...I want you to persuade him to lay off Cheryl.
- I don't have that kind of influence.
- I think you do.
Anyway, you try.
Because if Cheryl has any trouble with Blackwon'th, or you, or anybody...
...the DA is gonna get a certain black book.
I don't know what you're talking about.
- You're wasting time again.
- I don't know about any black book.
Drop it!
I'll kill you.
Now, about that, I have influence.
If he doesrt drop it by the time
I count three...
...you kill him.
One.
Two.
Now, what I got here is a 12-gauge, full-choke shotgun.
Go ahead and count three.
Let's see who gets killed first.
Your call.
Okay, I've made my point.
You can take it or leave it.
- Sorry we're on opposite sides.
- Well, that's usually the case.
And if you touch me again,
I'll kill you.
Likewise, Mr. Earp.
In an actor's world, things arert what they seem.
A pauper is a prince...
...or a shotgun is a mop.
- You'll have to give this up.
- Why?
- You're gonna get yourself killed.
- People have said that for 50 years.
Can we go someplace quiet to talk?
Sure.
Hey, Mix!
Come on! Ho/a, Maria Chiquita.
- We dance later, okay, baby?
- Sure, baby.
Tom Mix.
I don't give a damn who he is!
He broke in, he wrecked the place and he insulted me!
I want his damn legs broken!
He practically accused me of killing Candy!
Look, shut up.
Did you hear what I said?
All right, I heard you.
Jesus.
- Hello.
- I'm at El Coyote.
Mix just came in with Earp and the girl.
There are a couple stunt riders here that think Mix is a phony.
If the price is right they might prove it.
Let me know what happens later.
Right.
Well, are you going to take care of Mix or do I have to tell Dutch?
What I do is my business.
- You're not gonna tell Dutch anything.
- The hell I'm not.
Except what I want you to tell him.
Otherwise, you're gonna have two gimpy legs, little sister.
You're gonna go home.
You're gonna call the cops.
Tell them that Tom Mix beat you up, then raped you.
They'll never believe me.
They'll believe you.
I want you to cry a lot...
...and show them the bruises.
Alfie!
And they'll believe you.
Bravo!
Ride her, pardner.
Bravo!
Where did you learn to dance like that?
I fell in love with a lady from Buenos Aires who believed...
...a man wasrt a lover unless he tangoed.
- Not much choice.
- I took lessons.
What was this lady's vocation?
Tango instructor.
- Is that the truth?
- Hundred percent.
Give or take a lie or two.
- To honest men.
- And brave women.
And friendships, tried and true.
Hello, boys.
We saw your wagon and thought we'd tell you right to your face.
- Tell me what?
- You're a half-breed candy ass.
Not exactly a hot bulletin.
That's why we hire fearless stuntmen like yourselves.
Mosey to the bar and buy a drink on me.
- We don't want a drink on you.
- We'll buy her a round.
How about it? You want to have a drink with real men...
...instead of a half-breed candy ass and his granddaddy?
Before you make two big fools of yourselves...
...I suggest you look under the table.
Do what?
I'd do what he says. This here's
Wyatt Earp, famous lawman...
...known to carry a pistol that he may have snuck out as you picked a fight.
Yeah, right. I know who he is.
He didn't come in packing no hog leg.
- I thought you were looking at my car.
- We wasrt.
Earp or no Earp...
...I bet you don't have a gun under the table.
It's your funeral.
- I'm going to kill you!
- One move and I'll pig-stick you!
Now, take my advice and run, while you still have your cojones.
Hey, Mix, baby!
Hello, Tom.
Let's take a walk, Dib.
Excuse me, darling.
Me and Marvin got important business to discuss.
- What the hell...?
- Walk!
- What did I do?
- Can it.
You set me up with those stuntmen.
- Tom, l...
- You listen to me, you lying shit.
I asked you for a favour.
Now I'm telling you.
Get Alfie to lay off Wyatt or the next time this happens...
...l'll drag you down Sunset.
Ain't gonna be enough hide on you to patch a pinole.
Just counselling the chief.
I'm a little more civilized than him, and I want to get my two cents in.
Give me trouble, I'll kill you, understand?
- Yes.
- Say it. Convince me.
- Any more trouble, you'll kill me.
- I believe you.
So from now on, whether you live or die is up to you.
Excuse me.
Can I go to the bathroom?
We gotta get something straight.
I threatened to drag him and you threatened to kill him.
- I don't like being out-threatened.
- Wort happen again.
Bad as being upstaged.
I'm a movie star.
Why are you here?
You don't come here.
We had an agreement.
Had an agreement.
What's that supposed to mean?
Any agreement didn't include you beating Victoria.
What? What do you...?
- Did Victoria tell you that?
- She did.
She fingered Mix, but I know what really happened.
And how do you know?
A year ago we made a deal.
I don't deal with anyone
I don't know everything about.
I know who and what you are.
I knew a guy like you when I was starting. Cocky guy.
Wore spats and a derby.
He used to brag about how smart he was.
Till someone shot him in the mouth.
If Mix is arrested, what happens to his movie?
I'll close down for a few days.
We'll recast.
Tom Mix will be washed up.
Provided he's found guilty.
The press will find him guilty.
Blackwon'th's arresting Mix is okay.
But not until I get
Candy's little black book.
- How will you do that?
- Nancy Shoemaker.
Mix is hiding her up at his ranch.
A woman called, but wouldn't leave her name. She sounded disturbed.
- You didn't recognize the voice?
- It was English.
She asked if you could be reached.
I'll get it.
Hello.
- Tom.
- Yes?
This is Christina.
Dutch Kieffer knows you've got Nancy up at the ranch...
Strap on your iron, we're saving Nancy.
This here is my flying buddy!
- Wyatt, Cheryl!
- Hi!
What about the funeral?
If you're not back, take Cheryl to the funeral!
Come on, Wyatt! We gotta go!
- You ever done any flying?
- Nope!
Me neither!
- It's still dark!
- It'll be dawn in 10 minutes!
Fasten your seat belt!
How much further?
About 50 miles.
Oh, shit!
What do you think you're doing?
Mostly trying to stay alive.
Hey, I know you.
- Ain't you...?
- Yeah.
That's Tom Mix.
Wyatt, I want you to meet...
What are your names?
- This is Henry.
- And this is Fred.
I want you to meet Wyatt Earp.
- Wyatt?
- Earp?
Morning, boys.
- Where are we?
- Now you're on the Circle C.
About 15 miles southeast of your spread.
We sure would appreciate the loan of a couple fast horses.
I'm getting to where I can't even stay on a horse.
Go on!
Hey, what do you want?
What do you want?
Let go of me, you big bastard!
- You'll be all right?
- I'd feel better if they was a camera.
Let's get her done.
Get in the car!
Get in there and shut up!
Spread out!
Get off me!
My God!
Wyatt.
Well, you done good, pardner.
Of course, a couple more inches...
To assure the resurrection to eternal life...
...through the Lord, Jesus Christ...
...we commend thee, Almighty God, our sister, Candace Girard.
We commit her to the ground.
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Bless you, my child.
Cheryl King?
Yes.
I would've given you this sooner, but I couldn't find you.
My card.
If you need help, please call.
I'm sorry.
- A man gave me this envelope.
- Open it.
You know a Leo Vogel, attorney?
No.
It's a safety deposit box key.
I'm glad you boys finally showed up.
What are you doing here, Blackwon'th?
I'm about to arrest America's favourite star cowboy...
...for felonious assault and rape.
Unless you try to stop me.
And I hope you do.
Rape?
You're kidding. Who did I rape?
You'll find out about that at the station.
Let's go.
I'm primed.
You wanna take him?
I'd like to, but he's not won'th it.
You bit off more than you can chew.
Call my lawyer, Saul Rosenstein.
I'll be all right, honey.
You go with them.
I'd run you and your lesbo girlfriend out of town...
...but you made some dangerous enemies here.
I'm looking forward to what's gonna happen when they catch you.
How's your nose?
Get out of here, before I forget I'm a lawman.
I don't think you killed half those men.
And the ones you did kill,
I bet you shot them in the back.
Let's find out, you son of a bitch.
Draw.
My men will cut you to ribbons.
Not before I shoot out your eyes.
Another time.
- Would you have killed him?
- No.
Why?
I'm not packing a gun.
- Hey, ain't you Tom Mix?
- I sure am, pardner.
Tom, you need a new sidekick?
- Can I get you anything?
- I don't expect to be here long.
Don't count on it.
- Hello, Michael. How are you, boy?
- Not very well.
- Mind if I ask you a question?
- Yes, I was framed.
Who'd do that?
Whoever got the bartender to drug me, then had me go to Candy's.
- And you found her dead.
- No.
She said, "Never trust an Alperin," then she died.
She was trying to name the killer. She just didn't have time to be specific.
You can take your pick, though.
I mean, there are four Alperins.
Well, three, if my mother decides to narrow the field.
What do you mean?
You didn't hear?
She's in the hospital.
She's not expected to live.
How much do you think there is?
Maybe this'll help.
"Hi, baby.
The man who gave you this key is an old friend...
...and a good lawyer.
If you need any help or advice after you read this, give him a call.
They say that confession is good for the soul...
...so here goes.
On August 11 th, 1916...
...I was a guest aboard
Alfie Alperirs yacht...
...which was returning from Catalina.
I witnessed Alfie Alperin fighting with his first wife.
Then he hit her, and pushed her overboard.
When he saw me...
...I was sure he was going to kill me.
Instead...
...he led me to his cabin, where he beat me...
...and raped me.
Afterwards, he said that if I kept my mouth shut...
...he would set me up in business.
Now, baby, I want you to give this...
...give this letter to the district attorney.
It will protect you."
It's an exciting evening, ladies and gentlemen.
We expect a gala turnout tonight of major stars.
Arriving now is Mr. Alfie Alperin.
No statement right now, okay?
The press conference is all set.
Any other news?
What's wrong?
Mix and Wyatt are at the hospital.
Can they hurt you?
I better get dressed.
So silly, losing my balance and falling over like that.
Is that you, Tom?
Yes, Christina.
I saw Michael. He sends his love.
- He didn't kill that girl, did he?
- No.
No, I'm sure Alfie killed her, just like I'm sure he did this to you.
Why do you protect him?
Because...
...he's not Michael's father.
He promised me that if I married him, he'd raise Michael as his own son.
I guess for a while he even tried.
But the thought of another man...
Then, when the doctor told him that we...
That he couldn't have children...
...he grew to hate Michael.
I did everything I could to protect him.
What about Michael's real father?
He never knew.
I don't seem to have had much luck with my men, have I, Wyatt?
I'm so tired.
Try to rest.
He'll never bother you again, my dear.
Welcome to the first annual
Academy Awards.
Before we start handing out our little statuettes...
...I wanna introduce an entrepreneur...
...a brilliant clown who retired his tuxedo coat and baggy pants...
...and is now one of Hollywood's most successful producers.
Known by millions of his adoring fans as "The Happy Hobo":
Mr. Alfie Alperin.
- Landmark in Hollywood history.
Arriving now, we can see Tom Mix.
But who's that he's got in the car with him? It's Wyatt Earp!
Thank you.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you for remembering.
Congratulations to all of us here today...
...for being here to celebrate this most important event for our industry.
As some of you know...
...my dearest wife, Christina, is seriously ill in the hospital.
So unfortunately, I'm gonna have to leave before you honour the winners.
Let me just say this in parting:
Have fun, enjoy yourselves...
...and those who are working at Alperin, my studio...
... especially the ladies, don't stay up too late, all right?
Enjoy yourselves. God bless.
Have fun.
Alperin?
I'm taking you in.
How can you do that?
You're not the law here.
No, just a citizen making sure a murderer doesrt escape.
I'll shoot if I have to.
You're insane.
This is Candace Girard's confession.
She saw you murder your first wife.
You're making a scene, Mr. Earp.
Walk with me to the stairs.
If I don't?
I killed Candy.
I've got nothing to lose.
- Victoria.
- Go on, Alfie.
Get out of here, Alfie.
Walk to the stairs.
You couldn't have beaten
Candace up like that.
You and Dutch find her after Alfie got through with her?
- Finish her off with an ice pick?
- And I loved every minute of it.
Hold it right there, Earp.
Get your hands up.
Get away from him, Miss Alperin.
Dib, get his gun.
We got a report from Paso Robles.
Four men were killed at Mix's ranch.
- Yep.
- You admit you know about it?
Sure. I killed them. Well, two of them. Tom got the other two.
- I arrest you for murder.
- Let's go.
Get back!
- What the hell?
- Interesting development.
- Get out of the way.
- He can't.
- What's this?
- Vickie.
- He can hurt Alfie. I won't let him.
- But not like this.
- We'll take care of him.
- She killed Candy.
Alfie has paid you a fortune.
- Just go down the stairs!
- There's too many witnesses.
- Miss Alperin...
- No!
- Victoria!
- No, Dutch. It's gone too far. Go away.
- Oh, Christ.
- You son of a bitch!
No! Dutch!
- Dutch, give me the gun.
- Tom, go get Alfie.
It hurts.
Why did you kill Candy?
She was gonna tell about what happened on the boat.
I had to protect Alfie.
You don't understand, do you?
Sometimes...
...bad people like me and Alfie...
...only have each other.
Daddy. Daddy...
Go! Don't slow down for anything.
Get me to the boat as fast as you can.
- Did you hear about Mrs. Alperin?
- No.
It was on the radio. She died.
Just step on it!
I think we're being followed.
Come on. Can't you shake him?
Just get me to the boat quickly.
It's all I ask.
You stop this goon behind us...
...or you're gonna see the inside of Folsom for a long time.
Do you hear me, Arthur?
Do you hear me?
Where are you going?
You passed the boat!
Hey! Son of a bitch! No! No! No!
No!
- Help! Help!
- Shit!
- I can't swim!
- Hang on, Arthur!
Help! Help!
Relax!
- You okay, Mr. Mix?
- I'm all right.
- What about Mr. Alperin?
- Better call the police.
Sorry.
You'd have drowned us both.
Better to drown.
They'll put me away for life!
- Think you can walk?
- Yeah.
Then why don't you start?
Keep walking till you find a place you want to start a new life.
You mean it?
I'm the hero, Arthur.
I always mean what I say.
Thanks.
Por nada, amigo. Get going.
You know something, pardner?
You're developing a real knack for upstaging me.
Some folks would rest a whole lot easier if you burned this.
Or I could open up the Candy Store again.
That you could.
Got a match?
All aboard!
Come back.
You never know.
Now you take care of that big guy, will you?
- I'll miss you.
- And I'll miss you.
Michael.
I'll tell you like I told your mother a long time ago.
If you ever need help, you know where to find me.
Yes, sir.
All aboard!
So long, pardner.
Adiós, amigo.

I just met you
Yet I'm feeling
It seems that somehow we met somewhere before
I think I loved you
In my dreams 100 times or maybe more
What a connection
I just can't conceal it
There's a kind of magic in the air
Ooh, I can feel it
Something special
Is gonna happen tonight
I want you to know that
Something special
Is gonna happen tonight
I promise I'll be good to you
What a connection
I just can't conceal it
There's a kind of magic in the air
Ooh, I can feel it
Something special
Is gonna happen tonight
I want you to know that
Something special
Is gonna happen tonight
I promise I'll be good to you
Something special
Is gonna happen tonight
Oh! All right. That's it.
- What's the matter, Marie? What happened?
- She tried to kill me.
- Well, isn't that the point?
- No, Lauren.
This is theatrical fencing.
This isn't an autopsy. All right?
All right.
Damn it! I don't even know why we have to do this.
If you want to do Shakespeare,
Shakespearean people have duels.
- Not the women.
- It's my ambition to play Hamlet.
Oh, that'll pack 'em in the aisles.
Yes.
Paulette.
Lan.
Good. Lauren.
Excellent.
Naomi.
Bitch.
- Lauren.
- Hi, George.
- Have dinner with me tonight.
- What?
- Say, "Yes."
- George.
- Say, "Yes."
- Why are you acting like this?
Because I wanna be with you.
Well, that's nice.
This is so funny, George.
I thought you were gay.
Oh, I am. It's just, I play so many heterosexual roles...
I feel I really need to do some serious research.
Mm-hmm.
And just when you think there's no greater depth... to which an actor could possibly sink.
- That's nothin'. Remember Fred?
- Fred.
I've got a 50 percent hearing loss in this ear... from him yelling "Stella" in bed.
I tell ya, I swore off actors a year ago.
I said if that's the only subspecies of men available...
I'd rather not date at all.
And I haven't. But there are other things.
My work, I perfect my craft.
L... Kor... Korzenowski!
- Yeah.
- He's taking students.
- Hey, but where you gonna get that kind of money?
- L...
I gotta use that phone.
Come on. You're up.
Who is it?
It's your sister-in-law. Hurry up. My feet are falling off.
Well, hi, Shirley.
I'm glad you finally...
Wait a minute.
Get in front of the camera.
- I knew it.
- Come on, Mom. Let me in.
No, we can't afford it.
Mom, please.
- Is that my baby?
- Daddy!
Yes, but she can't come in. She wants a loan.
Daddy, can I come in, please?
Please, please, please, please, please, Daddy? Daddy?
- Daniel, what are you doing?
- Oh, yes.
- You don't know she wants money.
- Of course she does.
- You don't know that.
- That's right, Mom.
Can't I just drop in to see my parents?
Okay, I need $5,000.
- But it's to study with Korzenowski. -
$5,000. - She might have a good reason.
- Daddy! Stanislav Korzenowski.
- $5,000, Daniel.
- I'll pay you back.
- What did you say?
W
- What was that?
- I know I owe you some money.
- You owe us $3 2,000.
But it's the Korzenowski.
Lauren, we sent you to Yale and London and the institute.
You have been at this acting thing for years, and you haven't earned a dime.
You are still working as a salesgirl!
- Honey, face it. Maybe it's time for you to give it up.
- Daddy.
- Daniel. Hey, what did you do? - Oh. Oh, Daddy. - Nothing.
- You gave her that money? - Oh, Daddy.
- I cannot believe that you did that.
- She is our only child. - Oh. Oh, Daddy!
- I can't believe it. She is sucking us dry.
- $5,000. Thank you, Daddy!
- She isn't. Well, I just got another bill from Bloomingdale's.
- Oh, thank you.
- Drop that now. Don't you dare start talking about that.
Give me back my fuckin' quarter! Damn!
Well, good luck.
I'm Lauren Ames.
There's my application, your board, your pen.
- Thank you.
- And my down payment.
Keep that for now. You still have to audition.
- Right.
- Sit down. Mr Korzenowski will call you.
Thank you.
You nervous? Sorry. I'm sorry.
- I mean, I'm sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay. No, I'm... I'm not... It's fine.
I guess we're all a little bit, uh...
Don't talk. Right.
Oh, boy. I don't blame you.
This is so intense. Shut up, Weldon.
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
- Holy Mary!
Isn't there one fucking phone in this whole town that works?
You got a phone I can use?
Yeah, hi. This is Sandy
Brozinsky. Who's this?
Howie. Okay, Howie. I'm holding in my hand this thingee... says you're gonna turn off my phone at noon.
Oh, yeah? Well, I wanna tell you somethin'.
I just got out of the hospital.
I get home after two months of intensive care... they wheel me into my building, I open my mailbox...
I find your thingee screaming at me I have till 12 noon today...
Hey, no, you listen. You listen!
I just opened the damn thing. I just now laid eyes on it for the first time.
What was I supposed to do?
Have 'em unhook the life-support machine so I could pay my bills?
Oh, really? Yeah, so now I have three... No, make that two minutes... to write a check and wheel myself down to your office?
Howie, is that the drill?
24 hours?
24 big ones?
All right, Howie. You're a prince among men.
I mean it. I wanna have your child.
Yeah, bye.
No, stop!
Please, do not screech at anyone else.
I am trying to prepare for an audition here.
Thank you.
Oh, yeah? What for?
A workshop with Stanislav Korzenowski.
Who's that?
Only one of the great geniuses of the theatre.
Now if you don't mind.
Hey, maybe I should audition for him too. I'm an actress.
Hey, no, I'm a pro. I bet
I'm more of a pro than you.
Uh-huh. Well, I just made
2,500 bucks doin' a movie, yeah.
That's where I've seen you.
It has been driving me crazy.
- You saw Ninja Vixens?
- I, uh, must have.
Huh. Well, this whole acting thing's been goin' pretty good.
I mean, it's all just bullshittin', right?
Actors are just bullshitters who get paid.
Where do I sign up?
Just exactly what do you think you're going to do in there?
I don't know. I'll make somethin' up.
You're going in to Stanislav
Korzenowski and wing it?
Jesus, you'd think I was gonna go in and pee on him.
Listen to me.
You do not audition for a man of Korzenowski's reputation... without a prepared classical monologue.
That means Shaw, Ibsen, Shakespeare.
I'm doing Ophelia's mad scene. I'm not waltzing in off the street... saying, "Gee, I think
I wanna be an actress."
You know what I bet?
I bet you haven't been laid in about a year.
- Ames, Lauren.
- Ah, ah.
Yes, I'm coming. I'm...
I'm... I will be co...
I'm... I'm... I'm ready. I'm... I'm...
- I'm ready.
- Quickly, Miss Ames.
I have a good mad scene.
It's really great. I just saw it.
Hmm.
I will not only wish you to absorb everything that I say.
I will also wish you to keep notes of everything that I say.
And I will wish to look at those notes.
Now if you say this is like high school...
I do not apologize.
I am an old egotist... and I want to know that you record my ideas.
If you do not, you're gone from the class.
All right. We begin.
We begin with vowel groups.
Vowel groups.
Mr Weldon... do you know the difference between a Texas diphthong... and a Georgia diphthong?
Sorry I'm late.
They made me fill out all these dumb-ass financial aid forms.
You want 'em?
You want 'em?
I cannot believe... I absolutely cannot believe he let her in!
And on scholarship!
I just bet I know what she did as an audition.
The woman has no training, no experience.
I mean, correct me if I'm wrong.
I really thought if you worked at your craft, maybe... just possibly, you'd get to work with one of the greats.
It's $2.95, not $295.
I knew that.
Something's seriously wrong with my life.
Excuse me.
- Are you all right?
- Better.
L-I w... I was just, um...
- Who cares? May I help you?
- Yeah.
- Have you got something in a pumpkin?
- The shade pumpkin?
- No, a pumpkin costume.
- Oh.
God, I sound like an idiot.
The reason is that I teach grammar school.
- You're a schoolteacher? - Uh-huh.
- You're not an actor?
- Oh, God, no. I'd be awful.
Why do you ask?
Oh, well, there's just so many actors who come in here. Please go on.
Well, we're putting on a little pageant... and there's a kid in my class who's very insecure.
You know, the other kids pick on him and his mother doesn't sew... and I think it would give him such a boost... to have the best darn costume in the place.
So I thought a professional costumers would have an incredible pumpkin.
But I can't go more than $50... because this is coming out of my own pocket.
I'm really sorry. I don't think we have a pumpkin.
What about a squash?
We don't have any vegetables as such.
I'm sorry.
Well, this is the last place on the list.
But I'll just throw something together myself, huh?
I really appreciate your time. Thanks.
Um, uh, listen. I don't know, maybe, uh, maybe someone...
Maybe I could, uh... I've made a lot of my own costumes.
I'm sure it wouldn't be that difficult. If I could help out, I'd... like to.
That would be fabulous.
- I hope you'll forgive me, Lauren.
- For what?
L... I don't usually lunge at women like that.
- Oh.
- But you just, uh...
I just had to kiss you.
L-I really am sorry and I hope that you'll want to see me again.
Oh, where in the world did you come from?
- New Mexico, originally.
- No, no, I mean... how can a man so delightful as you... be just wandering the streets of New York?
Single, single, yeah.
I can't believe it.
Well, that's not by choice.
I'd like to be married.
- This isn't happening.
- Why not?
Well, there must be something wrong with you. Don't you have any faults?
I smoke.
You smoke? That's it? Call the police!
No, no, no. It's an addiction.
Colton's tobacco. New Mexico's finest.
I hope you don't mind.
Well, I'll struggle through somehow.
Good. Very good.
Because, uh, I'd like to see you again... tomorrow night.
Well, yes.
Mmm, thank you.
What's this?
"Ooh, eee, ooh, ah, ooh, eee, ah, ooh."
- That's what you do in acting class?
- Those are vowel groups.
Mmm, sorry. "Wowel" groups.
- Ooh. -
Ooh. - Ooh.
- Ooh, I feel the same way.
- Ooh, ooh.
Will you please kiss me hard on the lips?
That was tender, but tasty.
- Bite my face.
- Okay.
Bite my leg. Now bite my other leg.
- You get her two 1 X legs and...
- Going over the fence gymnastics?
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, my. That kind of evening, huh?
Not the kind you're used to. No money changed hands.
No, no, no, no. Reveal, reveal.
You have killed your father.
You have married your mother.
Na, no words, remember.
Na, reveal.
Here we have a sick sea lion. Go.
- Miss Brozinsky.
- Okay.
You will now perform for us, also without words...
Hamlet's soliloquy.
Who's that?
Hamlet.
Hamlet.
Shakespeare's tragedy of Hamlet.
Ah, well.
Uh, for her, we get the comic book, huh?
Taxi!
Hey!
Hey!
Oh. Ooh, that creep
Korzenowski is driving me nuts.
Ooh.
I know what I need.
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Ooh.
To die on the stage... is perhaps the greatest single challenge... an actor can face.
The audience must know, must absolutely believe... that the breath, that the very life... is going out of your body.
Now...
You! You will die now, please.
No, no, I don't believe you.
Maintain your focus.
Na, I don't believe you.
- Maintain your focus and lean forward.
- Stop, stop, stop. Stop it. Stop it.
- Are you all right?
- Fine.
Perhaps you would like to die for us now, Miss Ames.
You, I think, I will shoot.
You will feel the bullet enter your body.
You will lose all muscle control.
You will fall down dead.
Bang.
This can only be the achievement... of years of training.
No other way would we ever see so false a performance.
So mechanical, so thought-out.
Never for one moment truly felt.
Here, you must reach deep inside yourself.
You must go beyond the safety of what you know.
We know you can act, Camille... but can you be a person of flesh and blood?
Ah, time.
We die again tomorrow.
And, uh, please, give me your notebooks.
I wish to see them.
You can't walk there!
Hey, Ed, you want the delivery or not?
The man is a Nazi.
I have never been the dumbest in any class before.
I haven't seen you for nine hours.
Taxi!
Taxi!
Mmm.
- You know what today is?
- No.
It's our third-week anniversary.
- Stop on the next corner.
- You got it.
- I think you need some roses.
- Oh, no, no, you can't afford any more flowers.
- Right here.
- No, don't stop.
- Half... Half a dozen.
- No, don't stop. I know what teachers make.
Don't stop.
Michael!
A crowd is gathered here. Traffic is backed up for two blocks.
Killed in the explosion are Lee
Veran, the owner of the flower shop... and Michael Santers, a teacher at Holmes Elementary School.
Two terrorist groups have claimed responsibility for the blast.
It's all right, Miss Ames. We've got a positive ID from his wallet.
You don't have to see him.
I want to see him.
I warn you, there's very little left to see.
Particularly in the, uh, upper body region.
I wanna see him.
I'm very sorry you feel a need to do this.
Just leave me alone with him, please.
What are you doing here?
- Me? What the fuck are you doing here?
- I beg your pardon.
- I am in mourning.
- Well, so am I!
- For my lover.
- Well, so am I!
- Who?
- Michael Santers.
- No, no, you little witch! No!
- You bitch, you didn't know him!
- Oh, he loved me.
- How could you lie, little bitch?
- Oh, get away from me! Oh!
- Get out of here right now!
- I'm gonna bitch-slap you! I'm gonna break every bone in your body! - Oh, you are?
- Oh, you are?
- Yes, I am!
How dare you! How dare you!
- Oh. Ooh.
- He loved me.
He loved me!
Loved you? Loved you?
- Damn right he did!
- Ha, that's obscene.
No, that's reality, baby, 'cause no way did that guy give a shit about you!
I refuse to believe for one second that he would lower himself.
Oh, he lowered himself, all right.
This is all a lie. You are psychotic. Yes, that's right.
I've known from the first time I saw you sleaze into that office.
You lied to that phone man... you lied your way into the class and you're lying now.
- I'm gonna get you for this!
- Whoa!
Whoa, my... Oh!
Well, what the hell?
- Well, that's not his...
- No way. Look at that.
- It's too small.
- It's a fuckin' pencil.
- Where's the appendix scar?
- And that little mole?
It's somebody else! He's alive!
He's alive! He's a...
Well, thank you. Wait a minute, wait a minute. This was my idea.
I don't care, I'm gonna handle this.
You don't have the dimmest, dullest notion how to handle this.
You can't just walk in and bluntly announce this kind of thing.
Thing, thing. What kind of thing are you talking about?
You can't even say it. You sure as hell can't tell 'em.
And just what do you think the response is going to be when you do?
You suggest...
You suggest...
You suggest that on the basis of this little nugget of testimony... we spend tax dollars on an investigation?
Have you been listening to us?
The man in the morgue could not possibly be Michael Santers.
All you have to do is look at his...
If you were to look... in the region...
If you were to look down.
Michael was not a guy other guys would have made fun of in a locker room, okay?
- I think he's got the big picture now.
- Well, I don't think he does.
This guy in the morgue, whoever he is... he's got, uh...
Does the phrase "needle dick..."
"the bug fucker," mean anything to you?
- I beg your pardon!
- You big lunkhead!
Now get outta here and don't come back.
The model of tact and decorum.
Oh, who gives a shit?
He wasn't gonna help us.
Well, of course not! You sounded insane.
Oh, it is insane.
If he's alive, where is he?
He's probably back at my house, wonderin' where the hell I am.
- Taxi! - Your house? - Taxi!
- Oh. - Taxi!
- Wait a minute.
- W-W-Wait just a minute here. - Come here! Taxi!
I don't believe for one minute that he's at your apartment.
Oh, boy, are you gonna shit cement!
Taxi! Taxi!
If Michael is anywhere, I assure you he is at my place.
- Taxi, taxi!
- Oh, you believe that?
I believe that he loved me, that he barely knew you.
And you're... you're fantasizing a relationship that is probably...
- an isolated, drunken encounter.
- Isolated? Isolated?
Hey, this girl does not have one-night stands.
Every guy I have ever slept with... and we are way into double digits here, has come back for more.
Every single one!
- You wanna hit me, right? - Oh, wouldn't
I just love it. - Okay, give it a try.
Give it a try. Let's go, let's go.
Bob and weave, honey. Bob and weave.
- Who dresses you anyway?
- Okay, okay. Try it. Okay.
Stand still, you little bitch. I'm gonna bash your little WASP brains out.
I'm gonna hit you. I'm gonna murder you.
- That's what I'm gonna do.
- Talk about dingbats.
They'll lead us right to him.
- Nine... Nine years of ballet!
- You're too weird to hit.
- Taxi! - Oh, taxi!
- Taxi! - Taxi!
Taxi! Well, now wait just a minute. Wait just a...
All right, all right. Okay, okay. You insist Michael is at your apartment.
I think he's at mine.
So we'll go to both.
If he's at your place, which I doubt... then I will tell him goodbye and good riddance.
If on the other hand he's at mine... you will find yourself a nice biker and compare tattoos.
Oh!
You see, he's here.
Now don't make a scene.
Try to be adult about this.
- Oh, my God.
- Relax, it's just thieves.
Russian thieves?
He was here.
- Colton's?
- They're looking for Michael.
Let me see.
Hi, Mrs Hardy.
- Who are these morons?
- I don't know.
Stop! Come back!
Oh, oh. Oh, God.
- Oh, my God.
- Help me.
Come on!
Pretty baby.
- Oh!
- Put it down. This isn't supposed to be up.
Oh, damn! You messed up the thingee!
You crazy bastards.
Mr Atkins, these girls are bimbos. They know nothing.
- What do we want 'em for?
- They know he survived.
They may know where he is. We gotta get back on the trail.
So we're gonna cover every airport, every bus depot... every train station, every car rental out of this city.
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my God.
Well, so much for your apartment. You wanna try mine?
They've been here. Oh, my God.
Wait a minute. Nobody's been here. This is normal.
- Come on. Geez!
- Oh, no.
Michael? Michael?
Michael? Michael? Mi...
- He's not here.
- I'm going to find him.
- Oh yeah? -
Yeah. - Where?
Well, he... he could be hiding, he could be hurt. I don't know.
But I know that he needs me. Now if you'll excuse me.
Where you gonna look? His apartment?
You think he's gonna be hangin' out at his apartment, someone wants to kill him?
Oh, well, I'm not going to his apartment.
- Then where are you going?
- Isn't that my business?
Okay, look. Hold it, okay?
All right, if you have an idea, you might as well tell me.
And we'll both go. We'll go find him and we'll help him out of this.
And then we'll make him choose.
- Choose?
- Yeah.
- Between us?
- Yeah.
- I doubt that he'll know your name.
- Then we're on.
I mean, you're so goddam sure it's gonna be you, what do you care?
I'm confident, yes.
Well, so am I. So let's go.
- Good.
- Oh, wait. I gotta fluff.
Could you fluff a little faster?
- What is that?
- I got it off a Christmas tree at Saks.
- You defiled a Christmas tree?
- No one saw.
What, nothing for the nose?
Oh, Lady Di, explain this to me.
The man's afraid for his life.
He's not gonna stop and buy tobacco.
Oh, you obviously didn't spend the kind of time with Michael that I did.
- He... He couldn't last a day without his Colton's.
- I knew that.
Uh-huh. Did you also know this is the only place in town that carries it?
- I didn't know that.
- No, no, you didn't.
Now, listen. This time, let me handle this.
Your simplest exchanges with people become pornographic.
- That is a fucking lie.
- Need I say more.
Excuse me, sir.
Yeah, I know the guy.
Have you seen him? Was he here today?
Yeah, maybe.
Maybe not.
When do you think you might arrive at a decision?
Uh, over a drink?
Mm-hmm. Wouldn't you feel better, as a person... just unselfishly helping somebody find out something she really needs to know?
No. How 'bout dinner?
- How 'bout a blow job?
- How 'bout a...
- What did you say?
- Right here. Right now. Both of us.
Kind of, uh, taking turns.
- He was in here this afternoon.
- This afternoon?
- You sure it was this afternoon?
- Yeah, right at my lunch break.
1:00. He bought 10 pouches of Colton's.
- What else?
- Nothing. He was kinda in a hurry.
He used the phone and then he ran right out of here.
He used the phone at 1:00? Is that it?
That's all she wrote, baby.
Here or in the back?
I think I can take care of it from here.
Couple of floozies!
Oh, my God.
- That is the most disgusting, unscrup...
- What is your problem now?
Promising sexual favours? That sends us back to the Dark Ages.
It's something you simply do not do!
You do if you're lying.
Besides, it worked.
Excuse me, but I must have missed something.
How exactly did it work?
We're at a dead end.
- You'll see. - I'll see?
- Howie Rinker, please.
- Oh, Howie.
- How! San!
- Great, how 'bout you?
- Hey, Frankie, wanna paper?
Yeah? How's your fish?
Uh-huh. What'd the vet say?
- What does a diseased fish have to...
- Stop it. It's in the bag.
Listen, cutey.
Seeing as how you're my main man over at the phone company...
I wanna ask you just a teensy favour, all right?
Can you tell me what number was called out of Wally Frank Tobacconist at 1:00?
- This afternoon. Yeah, yeah, I'll hold.
- This is good.
It's probably one of those guys with polyester pants and hips.
- Yeah, I'm here. - Uh-huh.
- Good boy.
- All right.
That's a cab company, right?
Got it. Oh, you're a catch, How.
Our kids are gonna be gorgeous, you know that?
- See you.
- Okay, don't gloat.
Taxi!
Is that all the money you walk around with?
Well, where's yours? I thought you were the working pornographic actress.
I went to the Bahamas.
Hi. Can you help me? I, uh... I'm such a ditz.
L-I left my, uh, tennis racket in one of your cabs today.
Uh, I was picked up around, uh, uh, 77th a-a-and Broadway... at 1:00.
- Is there a reward? - Yes. - No.
Ooh! Ah!
What the hell is goin' on? What the hell you gonna do to me, huh?
- What's wrong with you?
- Yo!
Dipstick! There's your man.
What?
- Your turn.
- Come on, Rico. Back to work.
- I don't wanna go back to work.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
No, I can't talk to him.
I went to a private school.
Hey, he looks like a prince. He's gonna love you.
Hi.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about a fare... you might've had earlier in the day.
A very attractive Cauca-ca...
Just "person" will do nicely, won't it? Why differentiate?
You would have picked him up, uh, right outside a little smoke shop.
Does that ring any bells of any kind?
Whatsoever? Hello?
- Tall dude? -
Yes. - Tweed coat?
Yes, yes. A tweed coat, right.
I don't remember a thing.
- No, no, you just said a tall dude...
- I didn't say nothin'.
Oh, come on now. Don't give me a big song and dance.
Oh, no.
Yeah. Oh, my God.
- He's going to hurt us.
- What the hell is the matter with you?
Why should he help us with nothin' in it for him?
All right, you tell me. What should I do?
You're an actress. Bullshit him.
I don't use my training to tell lies to people.
Well, what do you use it for? Geez, it's so simple.
Hey, how'd you like to make a quick 200 bucks?
- Say what?
- 200 bucks, cash... to take us to where you, uh, took the guy.
Are you out of your mind? We don't have $200.
Ah, chill out, would ya?
Where are we?
We've been going for miles, and I haven't seen a single white person on the street.
There's one. Oops, they got him.
That's not funny.
- Oh, my God.
- You sure this is it?
Hey, keep your pants on. We're coming right out, all right?
Look, you know and I know I'm never gonna get another cab to come out here to Vietnam, cue ball.
So get real, all right?
All right, I'll give you 300 bucks.
Three hundred bucks just to sit here till we get back.
Three hundred?
You're a real pain in the ass. You know that?
- Gonna break his neck. I'm gonna break his neck.
- Beyond belief.
- You're really determined to have us killed, aren't you?
- Hey, get over yourself.
- He's not gonna kill us.
- Oh? Why not?
- 'Cause we're gonna be raped and murdered in this building.
- Oh!
Oh! Ohh.
Oh, no. Oh. Is that urine on the floor?
- What's a little urine?
- Freeze!
- Oh, my God, he's just a child.
- Well, at least rape's out.
Let me do this. Do you really think you should be playing with your daddy's...
Shut up! Where's your money? Credit cards!
- Revoked. Where do you think?
- Your bags.
- Throw 'em over here.
- Oh, I love this bag.
Ohh! Oh! Oh.
I'm not hit. You little...
Give me that, you little thug.
- I'll be damned. -
What? - It's a fake. - Oh.
- Where'd you get this?
- Santa.
Oh, yeah? Well, if you want to see another
Christmas, you're gonna have to help us find someone.
Shh.
- Come on, man, stop begging.
- This was a mistake.
Not any more.
Police! You're under arrest!
Don't even think about it. Don't even fuckin' think about it, or I'll blow your fuckin' nuts off!
Do we understand each other? Okay, turn around.
Face the wall. Do it.
Do it! Do it! Do it!
- Okay, frisk 'em.
- Frisk 'em?
Damn. Busted by two broads.
Nice buns, boys. You been working out?
Read 'em their rights.
You have... the right to remain silent... because anything you say can... and will be used against you.
You, uh...
Attorney. You have, uh, you have the right to an attorney.
- Shit.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I heard it, I heard it.
Hey, look, look, what do you want? You got it. Just talk to me.
You know, he's right. We could make you a real sweet deal, baby.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we heard it.
Wait a minute. Maybe they can help us find Santers.
- They don't know Santers.
- Michael Santers?
The hell you say! He was just here.
He was just here a few hours ago.
- Rat fixed him up with a passport.
- Ah, fuck you, Gilroy.
- What the fuck you want me to say?
- Oh, we're in the phoney ID business as well. Ain't that nice?
- What name was the passport under?
- I wanna talk to a lawyer.
Oh, yeah? It's gonna be kind of a short conversation.
They'll have to squeegee your brains off the wall.
Yeah. You, uh, you better tell her the name.
- She's kinda cranky.
- Yeah. I got my period.
- John Strauss.
- John Strauss.
- Where'd he go?
- Hey, look, he's leaving town. That's all I know.
Hey, look, I'm bein' real nice here, huh?
Why don't you be nice and, uh, open that box on the table?
Go on.
- Now, look, why don't you just keep it?
- You givin' them the money?
- Forget that we ever met.
- Are you sick?
- Turn around!
- Yeah. Happy to.
Well, I hate to give it to you, but that was pretty good.
Yeah, it was, it was.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, a deal's a deal.
And now, my man, we wanna go to the airport.
The airport.
- Eastern Airlines flight 501...
- They don't give out passenger lists.
- You have to be police or FBI.
- You are such a dip.
This is all the FBI we need.
His luggage was totally over the weight limit.
Can you imagine the gall, trying to bribe an airline official?
He offered me $ 100 to let it go through.
- Ah, what a world. I tell ya.
- This is the final boarding call for Eastern Airlines flight 501...
- Watch and learn.
- To Albuquerque, now boarding at gate 4 2.
Excuse, please. I was hoping you would to help me.
Uh... how... how do I to say?
You say it quickly. I'm off in three minutes.
My father, he's coming here. We...
No, I tell you from the beginning.
My name is Anna. This is my sister Elona.
My half-sister. She does not speak English.
My father, we have not seen him since we was babies in Prague.
He send us here in suitcase on train.
We, uh, escape, you see?
- No, I'm afraid I don't.
- Now we get letter.
He escape.
He is here.
But we do not know where.
We do not know which plane.
Could be any plane. Please, you tell us which plane. Please?
Absolutely not. I'm sorry.
That was the single biggest crock...
I've ever had the privilege to hear in my 19 years at this airline.
I think that deserves something.
What was the name?
- Strauss. John Strauss.
- John Strauss.
- Here we go. - Uh-huh.
Flight 501 to Albuquerque.
- Looks like you just missed him.
- Oh, no!
Wait a minute, wait a minute. He took another line through St Louis, and it's delayed.
If I can put you on our flight
225 through Kansas City...
- you can beat him. - Yeah! - Aha!
- But it's leaving in one minute.
- You get the tickets, I'll hold the plane.
Oh, good, good. Two tickets to Albuquerque, please.
The white zone is for the immediate loading and unloading of passengers only.
- Oh, thank you.
- No parking.
The white zone is for the immediate loading and unloading of passengers only. No parking.
The white zone is for the immediate loading and unloading of passengers only.
No parking.
- Hey, what's your hurry?
- Come on, over there, you jackass!
Officer, those men are bad!
Hold it right there!
Hold it! Come back here!
I swear to you, she'll be here any second.
Her ivy got caught in the luggage rack.
Sandy, where are you?
She's a sick woman. She's gotta get on this plane.
There's a kidney in Kansas City that's not gettin' any fresher.
Sandy! Excuse me. Look out. Wait, Sandy. Sandy.
- Here you go.
- Hold up there!
- Anyone care for some money?
- Money! Money!
What have you done? Oh, my God!
- That's all our money. What are you doing?
- Hey! Hey!
Albuquerque, honey, Albuquerque. Thanks.
I gotta get on that plane!
I sell cars in Albuquerque.
Give us a call if you can.
- Wanna apprehend?
- No. We'll pick up surveillance.
I had this old Cadillac, see? We couldn't get rid of it. I said, what the hell...
Oh, my God, there they are.
- And I played it big. No use playing it little. I'm just sorry it was so...
- Look.
Fan out.
- Why don't you get your car the same colour as your...
- Come on.
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, where you gals scootin' off to, huh?
- Panansky!
- Bobby, this way!
Ow!
Hey, buddy! Hey, where do you think you're...
Throw something.
Go!
And I thought coach was bad.
Panansky! Panansky!
Excuse me. Sir.
- Has flight 501 arrived? - Yes, ma'am. Right there. - Uh-huh. Yeah.
Panansky!
Where's he going?
No, no, ladies. You know better than this.
- You're right. - That way. - You're right, of course. Thanks for your help.
Panansky! Where the hell have you been?
- Michael! - Michael!
- There he goes!
Wait! No, no, wait!
Oh, no, no!
Oh! Yes, okay.
- Hey! Stop!
- Go through that next light! Go through the yellow! Through it!
You can take the bike back.
Michael and I will be spending the night in that motel we passed.
Dream on. We'll be on a plane to Hawaii.
- I can't believe it.
- He's really in there.
Yeah.
What's the matter? You afraid?
Why should I be?
Then why don't you go rushing into his... into his arms, huh?
Well, why don't you?
It's a long way to come to get bad news.
Yeah.
Well...
- Oh, God!
- Oh, I know.
- Let me see.
- Oh, no! Oh!
- Rat woman! Oh!
- Oh, it's not that bad.
- Oh, I'm...
- Oh, no!
- Could we share the mirror?
- Oh, Christ!
- What is it?
- I would be getting a zit.
I don't see anything.
There's nothing there.
- No?
- No. You're worse than I am.
- At least you have eyelashes. Geez.
- Oh, what do you want? You're a natural blonde.
- And you tan. - I want eyelashes. - You make me sick.
Oh, natural? You think this is natural?
"Oh, my dear, you too can have this colour."
- No shit? It looks great.
- Oh, thanks. It's just a rinse and a cellophane toner.
- Yeah? - You want a Tic
Tac? - Yeah. - Okay. L...
Well, I'd say good luck, but...
Yeah.
- Whatever.
- Yeah, whatever.
Hello.
Michael, no!
You.
- Oh, Michael!
- Michael!
- He's all right.
- Oh! Let's get him out of here.
- Michael? Oh!
- Michael. Oh!
Oh!
You're okay. It's just a bump.
- Yeah.
- My God.
- Michael! - Michael! - I feel that we are entitled to an explanation here.
- What is your relationship with this woman?
- Did you make it with her?
Do you even know this person?
- That's why you're here? - Yeah! - Well...
I know you're in some sort of trouble, but I'd like to discuss this first.
- Please.
- Right now.
- W-Wait a minute. -
Please? - Oh, Michael. Here.
- Darling, let me help you up.
- Oh! Easy.
- You mean you did this on your own? - Yeah. - Yeah.
- There's nobody with you?
- No.
- He changed the subject. Did you see how he did that?
- Yes, you did.
Now, look here, Michael, there's an issue at stake and I'm sorry, you're just not going to get out of it.
- How did you follow me here? - L-l... Well, we... we knew you weren't dead at the morgue.
- And you told them?
- Of course we told them. We...
- Shit.
- Bad idea, huh?
Wait a minute. You mean you wanted to be dead?
It would have been useful.
Russell, abort the rendezvous. There's a chopper out there, and this could be trouble.
- Get out of here. I'll meet you in Tres Crucas.
- Screw 'em. You got the stuff.
No, we don't have the advantage here.
I'll meet you in Tres Crucas. Acknowledge.
You're the boss. Over and out. Let's go.
You're not a schoolteacher, are you, Michael?
Michael, what's going on? What's in Tres Crucas?
- I'm sorry you heard that.
- Who cares what I heard?
What was I to you?
- What was I?
- Convenient.
Moderately enjoyable... largely forgettable... and a lesson to me not to leave loose ends.
I can't go on. I don't wanna go on.
Oh, Mother told me about men like this. I hate it when she's right.
Oh, loose ends!
That's all I was to him? A loose end?
What are you doing worrying about your love life going to shit? We're gonna die!
That's comforting.
- Who the hell are they?
- Well, how am I supposed to know? He's after Michael.
They're the good guys!
- Help us! Take us!
- Down here! Here! Please! Help us!
Down here!
Get into the light! He won't go for us if we're in the light!
- But it won't hold still!
- It's moving too fast!
Sandy! Oh!
Come on, Sandy!
Hurry!
Oh, how do they ever catch criminals?
- He's going to cut us off!
- I'll get you. I'll get you!
Come on!
Looks like these ends are gonna stay loose just a little longer, you big shithead!
Come on! Down here!
- Hello!
- Weldon?
Hello! I guess you know Mr Atkins!
- Oh, my God!
- No, it's all right!
We're CIA!
CIA?
Uh, can I offer you ladies coffee, or, um, a Coke?
- Weldon!
- Weldon! What is going on?
I'm not authorized to debrief you at...
You're not authorized to debrief me?
After I saved you from being throttled? Weldon!
Who is Michael Santers?
He was one of our best.
Very high clearance.
Access to everything.
And then... we began to suspect that he was a double agent working for Korzenowski.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Korzenowski, our teacher?
Our teacher and, I'm sorry to tell you, a key undercover man for the Russians.
Oh, please! The man has a reputation.
He was the definitive Lear.
He is the definitive KGB.
That's why I was in that class.
I was supposed to keep an eye on him, see if he and Santers were in contact.
- And they were?
- We still don't know how.
I never saw them come within a mile of each other.
But somehow Korzenowski hired him.
What did Michael do?
He stole the prototype of an experimental virus.
It's called floratoxin. It's, uh, an airborne defoliant.
A few drops destroys all vegetation for hundreds and hundreds of square miles.
Like grass and trees a-and the... and the whole shot?
- As in California.
- Oh, my God.
- As in the entire wheat belt.
- He would do that?
All he has to do is spill a couple of drops, and the wind'll do the rest.
Don't try to bargain with me. I want $20 million cash.
And please don't insult my intelligence by trying to mark it.
All right. Only it's going to take a couple of hours. Where are you?
Don't be ridiculous, Weldon.
They're his accomplices.
- Oh, please! - They're professionals. - Oh, no, sir!
- I believe them.
- What?
- You believe that a couple of two-bit actresses... - Oh, l...
- Where are they taking me? - Could have tracked down Michael Santers? - Yes.
It was a rendezvous. They helped him to escape. I was there. You remember?
Yeah, what did we know? He was just some guy we happened to be boffing.
Damn it, I don't boff.
I have never boffed.
Okay, had sex with. Is that white enough for you?
- Move it.
- Sir, if you'll just go over their statements...
That's what I intend to do at Fort Morgan in a nice underground cell until we get Santers' whereabouts.
You want to know his whereabouts? Fine. He said he was going to Tres Crucas, New Mexico.
That's a little bit too easy, isn't it? Get in the van!
That's a little bit too easy, isn't it? Get in the van!
Okay, okay, here's an idea. Why don't we all go to Tres Crucas and see if Michael is there?
I'll prove it to you.
I kn... I know, I know. Your head hurts, and it's our fault. I understand that.
- But if you'd only identified yourself...
- Oh, I see.
- You want me to walk up to enemy operatives and hand over... - Oh, come on! - Ah, who's an enemy operative?
- Hey, Steve, why the hell are we slowing down?
- Wait just a...
Who the hell are you?
Oh, my God!
Some of us who teach can also do.
What do you want?
- Where is Michael Santers?
- Hey, you should know.
You're the ones he's working for.
This is last time I will ask you.
Where is Michael Santers?
Come on, come on, come on! Go. Go!
I think you'll stay.
I never died better, did I, teach?
Okay, let's go up, real easy.
That a boy. That a boy.
Yeah, you're a good actor, but a lousy shot.
Please, look, we can make bargain.
- Uh, the KGB is very generous.
- Oh... Oh, stop with the KGB.
How dare you defraud the entire
New York theatre community?
- Lauren. - I've never... Hi. - Lauren.
- I've never heard such behaviour in my life. - Lauren. - These people are artists.
- Lauren. - What is it? -
Th-That's not the hot issue here.
The... No. No.
Okay. Okay, here it comes, Stan.
You're gonna tell us right now what was going on in that class... or Sandy's gonna shoot you.
I'll shoot it off, Stan.
We needed couriers.
- How? -
Yeah. - Uh... your notebooks.
I left microdot for him in yours, and he sent back reply in yours.
Well, if he stole the toxin for you, why don't you have it?
He screwed you too.
He screwed me too.
Ladies, I admit I've made a big mistake, but if you'd just put yourself in my hands... you can walk away from here right now with full federal protection.
Complete clearance of all conspiracy charges.
I will give you free acting lessons for the rest of your life.
- We'll pay all the expenses you've incurred.
- Oh, stop it.
The both of you, you're so full of it. Come on, let's go.
It stinks around here.
Thanks for trying.
- We'll find you.
- Not if the coyotes find you first!
- Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, oh, oh.
- Please!
Please!
Blood is on your head, you putz.
- This is the worst day of my life.
- Yeah.
- We're a couple of chumps. You know that, don't you?
- Oh, we're worse than that.
- Mmm, well, okay, yeah.
- I can't believe I didn't see it.
- I am so humiliated.
- I know.
He hit on us for those notebooks.
"Hit on"? He got me to pick him up.
Tell me! I attacked him in a Burger King.
I worked all night on his fucking pumpkin costume.
- For a mythical student, if you will.
- No!
- Yes!
- No.
Hey, I baked cookies for his entire class.
- Oh, no!
- Could you see me baking?
Icing... Icing these little happy faces on every one of'em?
Well, I paid $5,000 to study with the KGB.
The KGB. Oh, my God!
Oh, he trashed me much worse than he trashed you.
- Oh!
- Really. Hamlet. How am I gonna know Hamlet?
You really should if you're going to be an actress.
Oh, pardon me... but, you know, we can't all of us study at the
London School of Shakespearean Weirdness, you know.
Some of us had to schlepp drinks for a living.
I'm sorry, Sandy.
Oh, God.
So, where you wanna go now?
I don't know.
They'll be after us.
- I was thinking...
- Yeah. So was I.
What?
That we go find Michael and rip his face off.
- That, and get the toxin back.
- Oh, the hell with the toxin.
- I just wanna rip his face off.
- No, we need the toxin.
We don't want the CIA on our backs all our lives.
- Just so I get to rip his face off.
- I promise we'll rip his face off after we get the toxin.
Hey! Hello, honey! Hello!
No, no, you idiot!
My shoes!
- Hey, Stan.
- What?
Looks like you're gonna be facing KGB tribunals.
Unless, of course, you'd like to make an arrangement.
Would such an arrangement include, uh, unlimited expense account?
Condo on the Potomac?
Redskins season tickets? Huh?
Aw, nuts!
Thanks, Humphrey. It was sweet of you.
Oh, it was my pleasure, Lauren.
Well, what should we do first?
Get a little sushi? Take in a show?
Now, why do they do that?
Has there ever been one woman in the history of the world who actually said...
"Yes, fellas, please, take me now."
For a bed and a bath,
I'd... I'd consider it.
- Bite your tongue.
- Hey, turisto. Welcome.
Hey, you're lookin' for a guide, right?
Native Indian to show you the hidden wonders of this great Chicatacawa nation?
Well, ladies, you have found him.
Special price, today only... $20.
I don't want to be the first to break this to you... you are not an Indian.
That's a technicality.
I've been a blood brother to the Chicatacawa since 1968.
I got a tan. What do you want for $20?
Honey, I'm an actress. I love to dress up and pretend. And the hat is fabulous.
But what we need right now is to find a man.
Well, okay, but it's not gonna be that great.
- I'm a little bombed.
- What?
And it's still $20.
No. No, no. No, no, no.
- We're looking for a specific man...
- So we can kill him.
Oh, then you need a witness. Hey,
I'll stand up for you in court.
I saw the whole thing. It was an accident. The axe slipped out of your hand.
It's a wonderful scenario. When we find the guy, we're gonna let you know.
- Thanks.
- Find him?
Find as in "locate"? "Track down"?
Hey, now we are rollin'. We have hit the nail right on the hammer.
I'm a tracker. That's my vocation... a tracker.
A guy who tracks down other guys. That's my main gig!
Genuine Indian shit.
- What do you think?
- He's a bum.
But he might have good instincts.
Should we ask for references?
Hey, you wanna find this guy or not?
- Ah, ancient Indian techniques.
- Oh, those could be anybody's.
Yeah, they could... anybody about 185 pounds... dragging his right leg a little like it's injured.
And... smoking one hand-rolled Colton's... every three minutes.
Admit it. The man is cool.
- Yeah, come on.
- Oh, baby.
Yeah, why you do this to me, huh?
Oh, my God.
Wow! That is some major ill repute happening there.
- Come on, let's go.
- No, no, don't try it.
You'll never get past
Gert. It's customers only.
Come on, let's get out of here. Come on. Hey.
- Let's go, will ya. Come on.
- Customers?
Customers! You get his shirt, I'll get his pants.
What? Come on! You had your chance at me, and you lost it. Come on, now!
- Oh, I want the hat.
- Will you stop it!
Who do you think you're kiddin', huh?
How old are you boys?
Thirteen? Fourteen?
Hell, you're just babies.
Why, you can't even shave yet.
- Your daddy know you're here?
- Hell, yes. He told us where to come.
Come. Get it?
Oh. First time.
Oh, no way!
- It's his first time.
- What'd you tell her that fer?
- You chickenshit, huh?
- I ain't! I done it plenty!
- You chickenshit. You chickenshit.
- Oh, you always tell my secrets. I'm gonna get you.
Chickenshit... Oh, lordy, don't do that.
That ain't no way to act in a whorehouse.
Be a man. Be a man!
This is Tina and Maria. Have fun.
Yeah, now tell me how we're gonna get it up.
Definitely not.
Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
- He's there.
- "Oh, God, oh, God."
- Won't be long now.
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God!
Oh... Oh, God!
- That was it.
- He'll be asleep in three seconds.
Did you ever think you'd be glad men roll over and pass out?
- Okay?
- You've gotta be...
Have a nice day.
- I've come to a definite conclusion.
- What's that?
You can have him.
Oh, God.
Was it good for you too?
H-H-Hurry!
Hey, baby!
Help me up!
You guys are the sweetest, most gorgeous creatures.
You're sweet.
Yikes!
- Hey, wait a minute. Guys!
- Wait a minute. We're not supposed to stop.
Why... Why are we stopping? Why did we stop?
- Oh. Sorry. - Uh, w-we have to get to a phone.
- Yeah, uh, uh, phone. - We have to...
Oh, God. - Phone. Phone. - Oh, my God.
- What are you doing here?
- Trying to get back to the reservation... before one of these guys hits on me for my phone number.
- Oh, come on, you don't look so bad.
- Except for prints don't work for him. He should stick with solids.
- Wait a minute. Did he say phone?
- Phone!
- Frank! - Leave me alone!
- Frank, you have to listen!
- No, I don't!
- Yes, you do!
- Oh! Oh. Oh. Oh.
- Oh.
- I'm sorry, Frank, but this is really important.
- Oh, leave me alone.
- Just leave me alone!
- Look, we gotta use your phone.
Forget it! You stiffed me for $20.
You leave me in drag. You got some maniac with a knife chasing you.
These things do not tempt me to wanna team up with you guys.
- Ah, what's wrong with my head?
- Are you okay?
No! I think I'm gettin' sober!
Look, listen, Frank, we're not just jerking you around.
Some guys are chasing us 'cause one of them stole a virus... that's gonna kill and destroy all the plants and all the trees for thousands of miles all the way around.
We stole it back, so now they're trying to kill us. You get it?
Jesus, the '60s were good to you, weren't they?
Frank, that's right.
Think back to the '60s.
- People did things for each other.
- They were wasted.
Listen, Frankie, get us to a telephone, all right?
I swear to you, you're gonna be showered with money.
Showered with money.
Okay, ladies, this is it.
This is it, Frank? It's not exactly the hub of the reservation, is it?
- Hey, it's off season. What do you want?
- We wanna use the phone, Frank.
Hey, five minutes. That's it.
If you guys stay more than five minutes, you'll bring down a goddam tornado.
We have no intention of hanging around.
- Fine.
- I just wanna make this call... I must have that blouse!
- That shirt has my name on it.
- Oh! Oh, I love this.
- I wore one of these when I did Oklahoma.
- Oh, that'll be cute on you.
- You think? Not too short-waisted? - No! You get a little snakeskin belt, give it a little texture.
- Oh, that's a good idea. I like this too.
- Hey!
Will ya? Come on, now. Just take the blouse. Keep 'em. They're on the house.
- Now, you gotta make this phone call. - Oh, thanks,
Frank. - Get on the phone, and let's get going here.
Right. Right, right, right. Okay, who are we gonna call? The New York Times. Huh?
- No. We'll call the president.
- Oh, yeah! That's really a call he's gonna take.
"Hi, we're two struggling actresses.
We're saving the world." Get real.
He was an actor.
Okay, the FBI.
We're gonna call the FBI, we're gonna turn this in, we're gonna save our country.
Uh-huh. Do you have a changing room?
This doesn't work.
They must have cut me off.
- I owe 'em a little money.
- Don't you know how to deal with those dorks?
- You don't have to pay them anything.
- You don't?
- No, all you have to do... - No! - What?
No, not that again.
Frank, how do we get to a phone that works?
Frank, how do we get to a phone that works?
Okay, ladies, this here's Frodo.
He'll take real good care of ya.
Now, you're gonna ride across those hills till you come to the edge of a cliff.
Don't go off there.
That's a 700-foot drop.
Now, if you do get down, you're gonna come to the rattlesnake area. Be real careful goin' through there.
Now, take a left at the rattlesnakes and you'll come around to a dirt road.
Take you right into the taco stand.
They got a phone in there. Huh?
It couldn't be just a block and a half to the corner store, Frank?
Not around here.
- Hey, Frank, thanks.
- Oh, okay, all right.
- Now, come on, we gotta... - We won't forget you. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- We're gonna see you get something out of this, Frank.
- Oh, yeah, sure.
I'll be showered with money. I can hardly wait. Come on, let's get outta here.
- Come on.
- Wait, wait, wait. I don't have the toxin.
- Wait a minute.
- Oh, hold on a second there.
Give me the vial.
Slowly.
- Let go of me!
- Go!
Whoa! Asshole! Come on!
Well, of course.
Russell! Boyd!
- Where's the other one?
- She got away.
- Now you're gonna make yourself useful.
- I don't know how to drive a stick shift.
- Get in the back.
- Oh.
Let's turn around, okay?
Let's just go this way.
Holy shit.
Go away!
- Frank?
- Go away!
- What happened? Where's Lauren?
- They took her.
- We gotta go find her.
- Oh, no!
Frank, I can't track her without you. Now, please, come on!
- You go! I'm busy bleeding!
- Frank!
You don't give up, do ya? You think I'm gonna go chasing a pack of psychos for some dumb blonde?
She's not dumb, and she's not a blonde.
- Well, good luck, lady.
- Frank!
Frank!
Okay, okay, the truth.
Lauren and I pulled a bank job. Those guys were feds, and Lauren buried the money...
- Spare me, will ya?
- Well, what about revenge?
I mean, these guys trashed your house. Don't you want to get even?
I'm insured. No deductible.
Save your breath.
I'm running out of bullshit,
Frank. They're gonna kill her.
I know it's not your problem... but this person and I, we've been through a lot of disgusting things together.
This person and I are...
This person's a friend... and I don't have that many friends.
I do.
I do.
Hello, Michael. This is Atkins.
Hello, Joe. Do you have the money?
Yep, it's here.
Fine. Here it is.
You'll get into the chopper and fly to
Mesa Azul Cliffs at the Four Fingers.
Don't even think about ground support because I've got lookouts.
Now, if I see a plane, a tank, a chopper other than your chopper...
I'll get very nervous and I'm gonna dump this stuff in the first stiff wind blowing east.
You got it?
You will not land the chopper.
You'll come level with the mesa and you'll lower the money down to me... at 5.:00 p.m. Exactly.
And now you're gonna make the exchange.
I knew you wouldn't keep your end of the bargain.
This is your big moment.
Don't you wanna do it yourself?
Atkins is a crack shot.
Like I said, I'm doing the exchange.
- I see somebody. It's Lauren.
- Now you wanna tell me how much you believe them?
No, don't shoot. Sir, she's being coerced.
- Will you land this damn thing!
- He's trying!
Throw down the bag.
- Throw it down.
- You'll shoot me.
I'm really sorry about this.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
- Aren't you dead yet?
- Not till I play Hamlet.
- Boy!
- Oh, you came back.
- Sure!
- I can't believe it.
- And look at you. You made off with the works.
- Yes.
- I got the toxin and $20 million.
- Wow!
This time l... l-I think
I'll hold the money.
- You don't mind.
- Oh, look, there's Weldon.
Maybe we can hitch a ride with those guys. Hey, handsome!
- Go! Go!
- Go where?
I will never... date a man again.
- Sandy.
- Getting laid just isn't worth it.
Oh, Sandy!
Get it! Get it!
Pull!
Pull! Oh!
There is no God.
- Hey, look!
- Hey, look!
Yes. Let's go.
- Let's go.
- Oh, fuck.
You son of a bitch! En garde!
- Yes!
- Go!
- Where is it? Shit.
- I don't have it!
I have it. Let her go.
No! You...
Shit.
Ah, nuts.
Oh, shit!
Nine years of ballet, asshole!
You did it! You did it!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
That is the best Hamlet ever.
Except for mine.
Wow! Yeah!
Oh, this is the happiest moment of my life.
- They bought that shit.
- Sh... "Shit"?
You're calling my Hamlet shit?
He's a wimp. I mean, look at him. He can't make up his mind about anything.
He stands around all night and says,
"What'll I do? What'll I do? What'll I do?"
Give me Romeo or Henry the Fifth.
Now, there's a guy I could boff.
Boff? Oh, we're back to boffing, are we?
- I see. That's... That's the criteria for your great...
- Absolutely!
Right, whether you would boff the hero.
Well, who will you go to
When there's no one to betray
And I said
Who will you go to
When your best friend turns away
Hey, hey
Last time you're gonna let me down
Last time you're gonna fool around with me
It's the last time
Last time you're gonna let me down
Last time you're gonna fool around with me
It's the last time, baby
Last time you're gonna let me down
Last time you're gonna fool around with me
It's the last time
Last time you're gonna let me down
Last time you're gonna fool around with me
It's the last time, baby
There's a garden full of roses
There's a necklace full of pearls
You have come to take the roses
To give to other girls
Well, I'm just a pretty thing
You wanted for a day
There is nothing left between us
There is nothing left to say
Hey, hey
Last time you're gonna let me down
Last time you're gonna fool around with me
Last time you're gonna let me down
Last time you're gonna fool around with me
It's the last time
Achtung Achtung! Feind in Sicht.
Alles in Stellung. Alles in Stellung.
Alle Maschinen für den Kampf bereit.
- You're off course by two degrees.
- Yes Sir!
You've got to watch them all the time...
Captain...
...otherwise they'll become sloppy.
They'll become very, very sloppy.
I think we should join the party, Captain.
Damn the passengers...
...to see, to become a Captain,
...not a party host...
...you take care of her.
She'll be all yours in another three days.
I will.
Check her position every 30 minutes...
...and tell the purser I will NOT be attending the over 50s party tomorrow.
Yes Sir!
Unless you'd care to go...
...I'm told you're an excellent conversationalist.
That depends on whom I'm talking to Sir.
Bastard!
Thank God it's his last trip!
- Come on everyone, let's move!
- Good evening Mrs. Marshall.
Nick, I want to dance!
I wish I was 20 years younger!
You're not Cyril, you'll have to dance with me.
Why don't you go to bed, you can't keep your eyes open?
Yes I can!
Another half hour Long John Silver and you're going to bed!
That's not fair!
She's staying up, why can't I?
I'm older.
Now that's enough, both of you.
Ooh baby!
You can come with me!
Hey, great!
Now we've all had lots of booze and what have...
...you all must be feeling very happy?
Let me hear yah, happy?
I can't hear you, a little louder, are you happy?
Oh, Ladies and Gentlemen,
I see our captain has joined us.
Captain, welcome.
On behalf of everybody, Captain...
...I would like to thank you for a very smooth trip...
...especially the overland section.
Captain, how about a little bow?
Let's hear it for the Captain!
Thank you.
Gentlemen, a little music if you please.
Forty years at sea and you end up being a straight man for a smart-ass comedian.
I wonder what sort of jokes he'll make about me when I take command?
None darling.
Nobody ever makes jokes about you.
Am I as stuffy as that?
I wouldn't know.
I hardly ever see you out of your uniform.
Wait until tonight.
Sir... take a look a this.
It's on a collision course!
Twenty degrees port!
Can I have that please?
Ben!
Is it past your bedtime?
Ben, that's greedy!
Robin, be an angel and take Ben below and put him to bed.
Say goodnight, Ben.
Come on!
Good night mum.
Good night son.
I'm sorry!
Thank you band, thank you.
Now, Ladies and Gentlemen...
...we are coming to the end of a very long...
...and beautiful voyage.
How about a little appreciation for a great band...
...Mal Diamond and the Boys.
Maybe you'll get used to all of this.
I never did.
Cruising around in endless circles...
...blue-rinse ladies repeating "have a nice day!" over and over again...
...and then having to have dinner with them...
...so that they can go back to Akron or Toronto or wherever...
...and say that they ate with the Captain.
I thought daddy was the Captain?
No dummy, not till the next trip!
Good! Then I can get all the cake I want!
Ben, come back!
Whatcha doing now?
I gotta go!
You've just been!
Well I gotta go again.
Ben.
Women.
It's as if it's deliberately trying to ram us.
Full to port.
Fast!
Get me the Captain.
My Husband was so anxious to come on this cruise.
But, when God calls, you have to go.
- Pardon?
- He died, just before we sailed.
I'm not grieving.
I mean, he had a wonderful life.
And he would have wanted me to come on this cruise.
- Are you a religious man?
- Excuse me.
He's a wonderful man.
But he's not religious.
How many more days?
Two and a half.
Are you counting?
Now listen, you promise you'll forget me!
I promise.
I know.
You say that to all the girls.
You're right.
What do you want me to say?
I don't want you to say anything.
Signal him to alter course!
We have, Sir!
Well signal him again, dammit!
Full astern!
Let's get the hell out of here!
It's going down fast!
Come on!
Come on, let's go!
We've got to hold our position.
Make it easier for Air and Sea Rescue.
They did get a distress signal off, didn't they?
Of course they did.
Daddy, daddy!
What is it?
There's something in the water!
Give me a hand!
Come on!
It's the Captain!
The poor man!
Make some room.
Give him air.
He's breathing, He's alright.
- Captain, you poor thing!
- He'll be alright.
Is he alright?
What can we do for him?
Wake up Margaret!
Margaret, it's a ship!
Wake up!
Ahoy!
Ahoy!
Ahoy!
Hello up there!
Is anybody up there, Ahoy!
Ahoy!
Hello! Ahoy!
Ahoy!
Ahoy!
Hello!
Is anybody up there?
Hey! Anybody home?
Look!
They've lowered the ladder!
Well at least someone on board heard us.
What would a ship be doing anchored out here?
I don't know.
Maybe some sort of engine failure?
Steady! Steady!
Right. I got it.
Mind the Captain!
Nick, go take a look.
Hello?
Hello, anyone on watch?
Hello! Hello!
Anybody here?
Hello!
There's no one here!
Okay Ben, up you go.
Careful now.
You next.
Come on Robin. Come on.
Come on. Give me your hand.
See where he's going.
Ben! Come here!
Ben!
I had to go!
You should wait till we find the washroom!
Nick, give me a hand!
Coming Sir!
That's it... that's it.
Easy!
Hang on.
Hang on!
Trevor!
Nick!
The Captain!
Nick! Come in here!
Damn your ladder!
We've got to get the rope around him.
Hold him there!
I'll pull him from above.
Okay Sir... I've got you.
- Is he okay?
- Yes Sir.
There must be someone on watch.
- See if you can find 'em.
- Yes Sir.
Give me a hand!
Let's sit him here.
Here, let me.
Are you alright?
I'm fine.
It's not so bad...
...we're out of the water...
...and it's a nice day, huh?
We could clear this mess up...
...play a little shuffleboard, get a tan...
...we'll have a nice trip. Whaddaya say?
What's going on!
Oh my God... Jackie!
Get me down! Please!
For God's sake, can you get me down!
Jackie, grab my hand!
I feel so stupid up here!
You can grab my arm!
Grab it!
What's the matter with you?!
Oh Jesus... Jesus!
Grab me!
Grab my hand!
Grab him! Come on!
It's swinging me out!
It's swinging me out!
Don't let me drop!
Hey... don't let me drop!
Get me back!
Get me back!
Get me back!
I'm going up!
Help me!
Please!
Jackie, your hand!
No Trevor, don't!
The propellers!
He's drowning!
He's drowning!
Come on darling, it's alright.
It's alright.
Up you go.
Come on... let's see what's in here.
Ben... is that you?
Yes Dad!
Come on.
- Are you alright?
- Yes.
Dammit.
What do we do now?
Do we just go on?
Be careful.
Watch your heads.
Herr Ashland...
Kapitän Ashland... können Sie Mich hören, Kapitän?
Dieses Schiff hat auf Sie gewartet.
Es ist Ihr neues Schiff, Kapitän.
Können Sie Mich hören, Ashland?
Ashland...
...es ist lhre Chance...
...worauf warten Sie noch?
Ein neues Schiff...
Ein neues Kommand.
Ashland...
...jetzt!
...Ihre Chance ist gekommen.
This old ship... seems to have a life of it's own.
Let's keep moving.
Mummy, I'm frightened!
Oh come on Robin, it's alright.
Robin. Come on sweetie.
Come on honey. Nothing can happen as long as we're all together.
Come on.
It smells a bit funny in here.
I wonder where the crew are?
Wherever they are, they certainly don't care about this ship.
What nationality can they be?
How about German?
- German?
- Yeah, look at this.
It says... er... "Please replace games where you found them", I think.
It's German.
I'm thirsty!
Me too!
Come on, let's see if we can find the galley and get some water, hmm?
Come on Robin, get up.
Listen, I'm going to try and find some clothes for everyone - okay?
I could use some help with Ashland.
Well I... I'll try and help you.
This it it, mum.
Right Robin, you start over there, and Ben and I will start over here.
Robin, now be careful and don't eat anything.
No no darling! Don't drink that!
No, not until we boil it, right?
That's it, there's a good boy.
Anybody there?
The steam comes up here and runs down there.
That's called condensation.
That's right Robin.
We learned it at school.
Just proves that not everything you learn in school is useless, hmm?
Oh look!
Darling, there's some water over there.
Oh, thanks.
Has anyone seen Nick?
No.
Hello.
Hello! Hello!
Hello!
Who's there?
Hello!
Probably Nick?
Probably.
Ashland...
...können Sie Mich hören, Kapitän?
Sie sind hier endlich in Sicherheit.
Ich erwarte Sie auf der Brücke.
Sofort!
Kommen Sie zur Brücke!
These old ships'll row on anything.
Even wet blotting paper.
Nick!
Nick, can you hear me?
Coming!
Nick!
This door was locked.
What the hell's going on here?
Did you find anyone?
No. There's nobody on board.
Well, where are they?
C'mon Nick.
Don't let this door shut!
What happened to you?
What is it with this ship?
It's like it's running itself.
Take me to the chart room.
Kapitän Ashland, Sie gehören zum Schiff.
Sie müssen es sofort führen.
Sofort!
I've gotta get to the bridge.
No Captain Ashland, No.
What... ship is this?
I don't know Captain Ashland.
No-one knows.
Captain Asland. No...
No, you... must lay down.
Rest.
Rest!
Rest.
That's odd.
The course marked on this chart...
...just goes around the Atlantic in huge circles.
Captain, take a look at this.
This equipment must be over forty years old.
We can't use this junk to send out a signal.
Let's hope our first message got through.
Look at this!
This one's about Hitler.
Who is he?
A rather unpleasant man, he started World War Two.
Is this Hitler?
Not quite...
The King of England.

♪ ...and everything that worries me... ♪

Listen. There's that music again.
He's wrong.
There is someone else on board.
Let's take a look.
Come on Ben.
Let's stay together.
This is incredible.
What the hell are those engines using for fuel?
All these gauges read zero.
Come on, let's get outta here.
Lead the way!
We've gotta get off this ship!
The lifeboats!
That's odd. I'm sure it was coming from this direction.
- Not in there.
- Maybe it's in the next room.
It's a movie house.
Movie house? It can't be.
Can we run the film mummy? Can we?
I don't know.
Let's see.
It works!

Mrs Morgan...
Mrs Morgan...
- What? What is it?
- It's a movie.
- Come quick!
- A movie?
It should work, It looks well greased.
Let's go below, get cleaned up, and get the others...
...and get off this ship.
Stop moaning and put the lights on.
I'll get it.
What's happening to... to me?
Mrs Morgan!
Don't touch her mummy!
She's poisonous!
Robin! Come back! Robin!
Help me.
Help...
Töten Sie, Ashland...
...das ist das richtige!
Töten Sie, Ashland...
...worauf warten Sie?
Es tut nicht weh.
What happened to you?
Daddy, daddy, I'm real frightened.
Can we all get off this ship please.
Thank God.
It's Mrs Morgan.
Stay with them Nick.
Oh Nick.
She's dead.
Of a seizure. It was quite quick.
At least she won't be in pain any more.
I suggest you assemble everyone for a burial at sea.
We are gathered here to pay our last respects...
...to a wonderful woman...
...that sadly, we knew for such a short time.
Those are quite the wrong words,
Marshall.
Perhaps you will allow me?
Let us pray...
...for the soul of our dearly departed sister.
O God, whose mercies cannot be numbered.
Accept our prayers on behalf of our servant departed...
...and grant her entrance into the halls of light and joy...
...in the fellowship of thy saints through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Almighty God, we commend her spirit...
...and we commit her body to the deep...
...in the sure hope of the resurrection and eternal life...
...through our Lord Jesus Christ.
Amen.
The boats!
The boats are our last chance!
Damn it I know it!
Quick, the other boat.
They're floating away, Dad!
This damned ship!
It's like it's alive, trying to kill us!
Marshall!
Can you step up to the Bridge please.
Would you care to inspect the Wheel House?
Charts, sextant, log book.
Daily sailing orders.
Main steering gear.
How do you like my chair, Marshall?
Ideal for long trips.
Did you say "your" chair?
Yes.
You'll get one when you are a Captain.
In the meantime, this is my ship, and I am the Captain.
Would you like to steer her?
All of my previous passengers liked to do that.
They liked to pretend to be a Captain.
Like you.
But it's no so easy.
Try it.
You took my last ship from me.
You won't get this one.
I didn't take your ship from you.
The company took it from you.
And you know why?
Because you can't deal with people.
You don't know how to handle a crew or passengers.
Maybe so Marshall.
But I know how to handle ships.
Engine room!
Full ahead!
A captain never leaves his post, even a pretend captain like you, Marshall.
Ashland, you're sick.
I'm taking command of this ship.
You can't.
No one can take this ship away from me!
Where do you plan to sail her?
Eternity, Marshall.
Eternity.
Come on Robin.
I want you to try and get some rest.
I can't. I'm too scared.
Oh shhh... there's nothing we can do until tomorrow morning.
Why? Why do we have to wait?
I wanna go now.
Quiet. You'll wake Ben.
Now listen to me.
I want to get off this ship as much as you do, but...
...we've got to wait until it's light so we can all see what we're doing.
Daddy thinks it's best that we stay right where we are.
We're warm, and dry and...
...we've got something to eat, and... well...
Understand?
What is it?
Ashland's totally schizophrenic.
He's taken on the role of a German naval officer.
It's as if this ship has somehow taken possession of him.
Where is he now?
I left him in the Wheel House.
- Ben's sleeping?
- Yes, yes.
We'll lock ourselves in for the night, til we figure a way to get off this ship.
C'mon.
Robin.
Robin?
What now?
I gotta go.
You can't, not now.
Hold it til morning.
I can't.
Come with me Robbie. Please.
Alright...
Men!
Where is it?
I don't know, but we'll find it.
No Ben.
But it's getting desperate!
Hurry up, Ben!
Okay! I'm ready.
Lori, I love you.
Do you?
Do you?
If you had asked me a week ago,
I'd have said no.
Now, maybe.
Come on. Let's take a shower.
I'm scared.
You're scared? I'm scared shirtless!
It's shitless... oops!
Never mind. I'm just trying to be polite.
- I know lots of other words like...
- Okay wise guy.
I think...
...we...
...we should go down there.
- You sure?
- Think so.
You go first then.
- You're smallest, you go.
- No, you.
Men first, Ladies last.
- Since when?
- Since now. Go on!
What ya whistling for?
If we get lost, we can hear each other.
- That's stupid.
- No it isn't.
Ben?
Ben!
Nick, open the door.
Hang on a minute. Looks like it's stuck.
Nick... this is blood!
It's blood!
Hold on... just hold on!
Hold on, Lori! Hold on!
Somebody help me!
Help me! Help me!
Ben, are you down there?
Let me out of here please!
Ben, I'm coming down!
Get me out of here! Get me out of here!
Help me!
Lori!
Lori! Don't give up!
Holt Eure Maschinengewehre.
Munition nicht vergessen.
Schnell, Schnell... den Patronengürtel!
Alles fertig? Ja!
Robin!
Ben!
Where are you?
Ben!
Robin!
Answer me!
Let me help you.
Daddy!
C'mon. Let's go find mum. C'mon.
It's Lori.
Stay here, all of you.
Shh... try and get some sleep.
And to our mighty God, we commend her soul, and we commit her body to the deep!
No!
Ashland you crazy bastard!
We've gotta stop him before he gets to someone else!
This way!
My God!
What the hell are these?
Gold teeth.
This must have been used as an interrogation ship.
It's still running.
Come on, let's get the hell out of here!
Come on!
Stop it!
For God's sake! Stop It!
This ship needs blood, Marshall...
...needs blood...
...it must have blood...
...must have blood...
...blood to survive...
...blood...
...your blood...
...and the blood of your wife...
...blood of your wife...
...the blood of your children...
...blood of your children...
...blood of your children...
...your wife...
...wife... children... children... children... blood, Marshall...
...must have blood... this ship needs blood, Marshall...
...must have blood... this ship needs blood, Marshall...
What's happening?
I don't know what's happening.
But we've got to get off this ship!
But there aren't any boats!
There may be something we can use in the ship's store.
Keep them back...
Margaret, keep them back!
What is it mummy? What's in there?
It's...
It's... it's not... not for you.
Just stay there!
Margaret...
...put these on the kids.
What are you going back in there for?
There's something else in here we can use.
- Come on!
- I'll help you daddy!
- Attaboy, Ben. Grab the other end.
- Robin, you take this.
Pick it up!
Up you come.
That's it.
Come on.
Hurry up! Hurry up!
We've got to stop this ship.
Keep this life jacket on all the time.
Now, do you hear me Robin?
Yes, mummy.
Get down!
No-one leaves my ship, Marshall!
No-one!
Come on, Ben!
Come on!
Go!
Run!
Stay down!
Go to the children, quick!
Hurry, children, hurry!
That's right Robin, push!
Go, Ben!
Alright Robin, get ready!
Go!
Swim for the raft!
No-one leaves my ship!
Trevor!
No!
No!
Get in there, you bitch!
- Achtung Achtung! Feind in Sicht.
- Alles in Stellung.
Achtung Achtung! Alle Mann an Deck.
Trevor!
Trevor!
Ben... Robin... where's mum?
She's still on the ship!
Trevor!
Alright... Margaret...
Alright...
Yes!
Hard to port!
You bastards! When I give an order
I expect it to be obeyed!
Do you hear me?!
Verfolgen Sie eine 30
Grad Steuerbordwendung.
Voraussichtliche Berührung mit
Feind um 21.00 Uhr.
I am your Captain!
I command you to alter course!
Ben... give me that.
Sit over here.
Kurs und Position ein. 190 Grad
Steuer voraus. Volle Kraft voraus...
It's going the other way.
We made it!
We'll be alright now.
Keep paddling!
That's it.
Roger, base. We'll make just one more sweep then we're headed home.
Hold it!
I think we've got something here.
Yeah! We have a raft.
One, two, three, four... Yeah, four people.
No sign of any further survivors.
Hello! Hey! Hello!
They seem to be in pretty good shape.
Heading in to execute rescue.
We're safe, Margaret. We're safe.
Robin... we're alright!
Mother!
Gotcha!
All right,
... you're asking for it!
- One more step and...
... you're gonna get it!
Parental abuse!
- I'll quit if you quit.
- Truce?
Truce.
Help your old mother up.
I had my fingers crossed!
You're gonna be very sorry...
Don't do that!
Not as sorry as you!
Jerry's home!
Come on.
Come on, honey...
"Jerry's home"
Yeah!
Excuse me, lady, is this the Blake residence?
- It is.
Stephanie home?
She's in the backyard.
- I've got a surprise for her.
- What?
- Something no family should be without. - What is it?
Stephanie!
There's somebody I'd like you to meet.
I can't tell you what his name is, because he doesn't have one yet.
Names don't seem to matter much.
I had a dog when I was a kid.
He was just a mutt, but to me, he was Rin Tin Tin.
Rin Tin Tin?
Well, that was a little before your time, I guess.
So, what do you think? Can we give this little guy a home?
- Sure.
- That's my girl...
I'll go inside and call Karen to tell her about the puppy.
- Honey... What do you say?
- Thanks, Jerry!
I gotta fix that screendoor one of these days...
I hope she doesn't think I was trying to buy her love.
- Maybe the puppy was a mistake.
- The puppy was perfect.
You're perfect!
Give her some time.
It'll be fine.
I know... All takes time!
And time is one thing I got plenty of.
I feel like I'm watching a tennis match.
Stephanie, why don't you ease in for a landing?
I'll stop pacing if you stop doodling.
All right, you pace, I'll doodle, and we'll both be happy.
We were... talking about your father.
My father died a year ago.
Sorry, I meant your stepfather.
If my father hadn't died, there wouldn't be a stepfather.
You're mad at him for dying.
I'm mad at somebody!
Being unable to accept your father's death...
... is part of the reason you've been getting into trouble.
I'm not in that much trouble.
Suspended three times last year...
Twice this year, and school's barely been in session two months.
I know what my problem is.
Him.
If he wasn't here, my Mom and I would be alright.
Steph, you're going to have to face the fact...
... that your mother loves the guy.
She doesn't see!
Doesn't see what, Stephanie?
I think my time is up.
Isn't it?
So, how was your session?
OK.
Sweetheart, it seems like you and I are always budding heads.
How about we try to get along a little better?
Sure.
One more thing and then I'll shut up.
It's very important to your mother and to me...
... that you try to get along better in school this year.
What do you say?
Stephanie, knock it off!
Girls, come on, stop it!
Enough!
It's the last time you cause an outburst in my classroom.
Mr. Conroy! Stephie didn't start it!
When I want your opinion, Baker,
I'll ask for it.
You couldn't have got yourself in deeper trouble if you tried.
Well, Norah, what do you think?
- I love it!
- I knew you would.
And this is the south. You'll have sun all day long.
- What do you think, pumpkin?
- I don't know...
Oh! One thing I forgot to mention.
It comes with a swing set.
I have a daughter, too.
She's a few years older than you.
Her name is Stephanie.
She goes to Oakridge High, which is where you'll be going one of these days...
... after your parents buy the house.
- What grade are you in, Cindy?
- Third.
Third grade... !
I remember when Jill was in third grade.
I used to walk her home from school every day.
- Who's Jill?
- That's my daughter.
You said her name was Stephanie.
Right, Stephanie.
She goes to Oakridge High.
She's on the student council.
She's a straight A's student.
I'm very proud of her.
- Suspended again?
- Expelled.
No! What're you gonna do?
Maybe boarding school.
- Really?
- I'm sure gonna try for it.
What's your stepfather gonna do when he finds out?
He's gonna kill me.
Expelled? You're kidding.
Principal said it wasn't working out.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Girls don't get expelled.
All right, it's over...
The damage is done...
Now...
What are we gonna do about the future?
I wanna go to a boarding school.
You wanna leave home?
It's not a family without children.
I think it'd be best for everybody.
Best for everybody?
Running away would be best for everybody?
It's not running away!
Well,
Jerry, what do you think?
I don't think we have to break up the family, do we, pumpkin?
Father knows best.
Karen, it's freaky, the way he looks at me...
... like he wanted to erase me off the face of the earth.
I'm sure.
Ok, don't believe me.
Ok, so, what's the verdict?
Is Scary Jerry gonna let you go to a boarding school?
I don't know. He has his own fantasy we should be like families on TV.
Grin and laugh, and have fewer cavities all the time...
It's like having Ward Cleaver for a Dad.
I gotta hang. Firing squad has arrived. Bye.
Come in.
So, where's my blindfold?
What blindfold?
I thought the condemned person always got a blindfold.
You don't really wanna leave home... do you, honey?
Yes, I do.
It isn't our house anymore...
... it's his!
Of course it's our house.
It's always been our house.
I loved your father, and when he died I thought:
"Well, maybe that's it.
Maybe you only get one chance to be happy. "
I never thought I'd love anybody that much again.
I know, Mom.
I miss him so bad...
I know you do, honey.
We have a second chance with
Jerry.
He's a wonderful man.
And he wants to care for us.
Can't you just...
... give him a chance?
I'm trying.
I'm really trying hard!
There's just something about him.
- Well, what is it?
- I don't know! I just...
I hope you're not still upset...
... over this school business.
We were just talking about that.
Everything will look clearer in the morning, uh?
We'll work it out.
Good night, sweetheart.
Good night, Mom.
Sweet dreams, Steph.
G' night, Jerry.
Wilbur, will you turn the page for me?
Turn it yourself. You've got a tongue.
No, I'd better not.
I tried it yesterday and swallow the comic section.
OK, I'll be quiet as a church mouse.
I used to love this show when I was a kid.
It wasn't till I got in high school
I realized horses couldn't talk.
- I bet you were cute back then.
- Yeah...
I'd like to see a picture of you.
You would, wouldn't you?
You never talk about your past.
I didn't even exist until
I met you.
Past is important.
Don't try to touch the past.
It isn't real.
It's just a dream.
The only reality is...
... this moment.
You and me.
Here and now.
What are we doing here?
This is the house where Henry
Morrison murdered his family.
Do you think I don't remember that?
I was here that night.
I never wanna see anything like that again.
Yeah, I know. A friend of mine sent me your article.
I was in Europe at that time.
It took 9 months for me to get it.
Cops did never really catch the guy.
File's inactive. I think it should be reopened.
Yeah, well... Talk to the cops.
I'm just a reporter.
Well, I talked to the cops.
They can give a shit.
Listen to me a minute, alright?
Three weeks before Morrison killed them...
... he quit his job, didn't tell anybody.
Got up every morning, pretending he'd go to work, and came home at the same time every night.
So how far could he go every day...
... and still get back at the same time every night? Look at this.
It has to be...
... somewhere within this radius.
See, what I think...
... is that during that time he was setting himself up a new life, somewhere close by.
- What do you want from me?
- Just this: do a follow up story, right?
You run a picture of Morrison.
Your paper circulates in this area.
Someone might recognize him and if they do, Brennan, you're a hero.
Why are you chasing this?
Vicky Morrison's maden name was Ogilvie.
She was my sister.
Oh... Jesus!
I'm sorry, Ogilvie, uh?
Ok, I'll do what I can, right?
OK.
This place is mine now.
You wanna go inside?
Fuck no!
I'll take him.
Everybody! Everybody!
Jerry is gonna make a speech!
I guess you all know why I asked you here.
'Cause when I first started with
American Eagle Realty, a year ago, you were the first five families
I sold houses to.
Yeah, Jerry, I've been meaning to ask you about my garage door.
It would still work if you wouldn't have gotten your car into it.
We met doing business and we stayed to become friends.
And although I may be arguing against the comission here, don't sell your houses 'cause
I like being your neighbor.
I wanna get a picture with my family. Steph! Susan!
Come here! Come on down.
Yeah! Come here.
Yeah, come on!
- Come on, Steph.
- Oh, I don't know...
There we are... OK.
This is as good as it gets!
I hope you don't think what
I'm gonna say is pretencious.
I sell houses, that's my job, but sometimes I think it's more than that... I truly believe
... that what I sell is the
American Dream.
You can call me sentimental,
I don't care.
When I came here I was a stranger, but I never felt more at home anywhere in my life.
I have beautiful friends,
I have a wonderful new family...
Have a good time. Thanks for coming.
Look at this. They'd print anything to make a buck.
- It's just simple sensation.
- What's that, Herb?
That guy in Bellvue who killed his whole family.
Cut'em up with knives.
I don't think I know about that.
It happened last year, that's what I was talking about.
This thing is a year old and they go waking it up again.
This is terrible.
Jerry...
Jerry?
You're alright?
This kind of thing really gets to me, you know?
That a man could be driven to do something like that to his family? to his children?
I don't even wanna know about it.
Makes you wonder though...
What's it take to make a guy...
... do such a thing?
Maybe they disappointed him.
Hey, I thought this was supposed to be a party.
Hey, Tommy! Tommy, come here!
- You're Black Beard, the Pirate.
- Thank you, Mr. Blake.
Aye aye, Captain.
Steph, honey, would you go down and get the ice cream, please?
All we need is a little order around here!
Order!!
You're a good boy. You're
Daddy's little angels.
Why don't they just leave me alone?!
Let me out! Let me out!
We're gonna keep this family together.
You had better believe it!!
Hi, honey.
Oh, the ice cream.
Honey, you know how it is.
Being a salesman, smiling all the time, you know-Sometimes I, have to let off some steam, you know?
You know how it is.
Sure. I gotta get back or Mom is gonna wonder where I'm at.
Steph, things like these don't happen.
It happened to them.
Let me see if I follow your thinking.
A man murdered his family.
You hate Jerry.
Therefore, Jerry is the man who murdered his family.
Yeah... that all adds up.
Karen, maybe Jerry isn't the guy... but you don't know him like I do, or see him down in the basement.
And guess when Jerry showed up in town and met my Mom?
Right after this!
So, what are you going to do,
Nancy Drew?
I'm writing this letter to the "Seattle Examiner", and ask them to send me a picture of Henry Morrison.
I told them I'm in a project about mass murders.
Off the deep end...
Give me a break.
You didn't run his fucking picture!
- How is anyone gonna identify him?
- Get your hands off of me!
My editor didn't want the picture not me, huh!
I almost didn't get the article on the paper at all!
What do you want from me? I just work here, I don't make policy.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, I don't want this to happen again. Almost gave me a coronary.
Here.
And this is a job for professionals, Ogilvie.
You're just one man.
Why don't you get on with the rest of your life? Forget about it!
You saw what he did to 'em.
Can you forget about it?
Mom says you only charge half of your regular fees to see me.
How come you do that?
My 3 o'clock pacient is schizophrenic. I charge him double.
All works out.
Besides, I like seeing you.
You were gonna tell me your idea.
I wanna go to a boarding school.
Don't say it's running away.
- What's the matter with running away? - It's just that...
- What?
- Sometimes running away is the best.
It gives everybody some breathing room, right?
Right.
What do your folks say?
I think I can talk my Mom into it.
And what about... him?
He has this crazy thing about breaking up the family.
If you saw this man, you would say: "Commit him".
You probably are driving him crazy to a certain extent.
- Yeah...
Why don't I have a talk with him?
If you could be on my side...
I am on your side.
I'll give your father...
Sorry.
I'll give... him a call.
You're home awfully early.
Hi, honey, I run out of appointments.
Anything for me?
As a matter of fact, something did come for you.
Well, can I have it?
I don't know...
What do you mean?
I don't know if it's the kind of thing you should be looking at.
I'm just kidding. Here you go.
Ohh... My sweet little thing.
My sweet little bitch.
That's my good girl.
Yes, you are daddy...
Jerry, honey!
Yes?
Dinner in 15 minutes.
Okay...
Where did you go?
Oh, yeah...
Ahhh... That's my baby.
I'm sorry.
Hello?
Hi, Dr. Bondurant.
Jerry?
Dr. Bondurant is on the phone for you.
What does he want?
He wants you to come in for a talk.
Tell him I'm not here.
- Why don't you just come up and talk to him? - Tell him...
I'm not here!
And if he calls back, tell him
I'm still not here.
Er... Jerry can't come to the phone right now. - I see
Could I have him call you back?
- Yes, that would be fine.
- Thank you.
I take it you're the guy that called me... Ogilvie?
I'm Lieutenant Wall.
You're in my parking space.
I figured this way you'd have to talk to me about Henry Morrison.
For starters, Morrison isn't his real name.
- Well, what is it?
- God only knows, we don't.
His personal history was falsified and his prints were untraceable.
We talked to a criminal psychologist who proposed a possibility you might be interested in.
He said it was possible that
Morrison had done it before.
Married into an existing family, something upsets him and wipes 'em out.
You knew him,
What do you think?
I think it's better than a possibility.
What do you plan to do about it?
For the moment, nothing.
We don't have a single lead.
The guy is smart!
We won't have anything to go on unless he does it again.
You're gonna wait until he gets to another family and butchers them?
You're not hearing me!
We've got nothing!
Zilch!
Lieutenant, if you were me, what would you do?
Just between the two of us?
I'd get a gun and blow the son of a bitch away.
How do you do, Mrs. Leitner?
- I'm Jerry Blake.
- How do you do? Please sit down.
I've come to talk about the situation with Stephanie.
I'm afraid, Mr. Blake, it's a lost cause.
Well... I'm sort of a believer in lost causes.
OK.
I guess I have to face it.
Jerry Blake is the most wonderful man in the world.
He got you back into school, didn't he?
You know why, don't you?
To get out of seeing you.
Did it ever ocurred to you that maybe... it isn't the rest of the world that's wrong?
I told you how phony he is, and how he acted in the basement
... making faces at himself.
- Oh, come on! We all do that.
Why did he freak out and... absolutely refused to come and see you?
Because he's afraid of my eagle eye?
It's more than that.
He scares me, Dr. Bondurant.
I'm afraid of him!
Jerry Blake here.
Which house was that?
Yes, sir, I'd be happy to show you that house, Mr...
Martin?
What about 4:30 tomorrow?
Fine! I'll see you then.
So, are you gonna be coming back to art class?
No. They put me in typing instead.
What a waste! You've got a lot of artistic talent.
- Get out of here!
- No, really, I mean it.
You'd have a great future as a big shirt designer.
I really liked the one you made for Mr. Conroy.
The green hand print was great!
If I buy my own paints, would you make one like that for me too?
No, but I might do it to your face.
All right... Give it to me, give me that shot. Come on!
Maine she takes a jab!
Baker shots her jaws!
Maine pounds at his middle section!
Baker gets her to the corner!
- I'll see you tomorrow in school.
- Sure, great.
- Well, bye.
- Bye.
- Hi, sorry I'm a little late.
- No problem, no problem.
- Ray Martin.
- Hi, Ray. Jerry Blake.
- It's a great house.
- Wait till you see inside. Come.
- Come on in.
- Big mirror in the hall.
And lot of closets in here.
It's great. Kitchen back here?
Yes, it's back here, yeah.
I forgot to tell you, lovely hardwood floors.
Look at the inlaid.
It's terrific.
- Right, very nice.
- I'll show you the bedroom.
Lot of space here.
Lot of room for kids.
You a family man, Ray?
Confirmed bachelor.
How about you, Jerry?
Happily married. I wouldn't trade it for the world.
I don't know... I think it just works for some guys.
What's that?
You know, the family, home sweet home, all that crap.
What line of work are you in, Ray?
If you don't mind my asking.
Oh! Not at all!
I'm in stress management.
Sounds complicated.
The kitchen has been remodeled.
Built-ins. I like this.
I try to find ways for employers and employees to get along better.
I ask questions, they give me answers.
For instance: How do you sleep at night?
How do you sleep at night, Jerry?
- I sleep like a baby.
- See, that's interesting.
Because I think there'd be a lot of stress in your line of work.
I suppose there's a certain degree of stress in every job, Ray.
It depends on how you handle it.
Which way am I facing?
North.
Come on in here, Ray. Great big room for kids to tumble around in.
You know, a house like this should really have a family in it.
You mean you won't sell it to me because I don't have one?
Oh, no! I didn't say that.
This is all being remodeled here.
You really are a fan of traditional values, aren't you, Jerry?
Tradition is important.
Sounds like you had a strict up-bringing?
You might say that.
- Let me ask you a question, Ray.
- Sure.
Are you interested in buying a house or in me?
Sorry.
Force of habit.
My wife gets on me for that all the time.
I thought you said you were a bachelor...
- Er... Recently divorced.
- I see.
Sometimes I forget
I'm not married anymore.
Probably it's just stress.
What are you-- ?
Who are you?
How did you get on to me?
I'm looking for--a house--
Oh, oh, oh...
I don't think this house is right for you.
I think you'd be more comfortable somewhere else.
This house is for a family!
You know what I mean?
A family...!?
... Home, sweet home?!
All that crap!!
OK.
It's alright.
A little order around here...
Just a little order, that's all.
A little order around here!!
Bondurant.
Dr. Bondurant?
Well,
Dr. Bondurant.
Rest in peace, doctor.
Come on, come on, Doctor.
Let's go.
All right, doctor.
We got to go...
... a little ride.
We'll take a little ride.
You seem disappointed he didn't turn out to be Jack the Ripper.
I was wrong, Karen.
I was totally wrong.
Doctor.
Buckle up for safety.
Steph?
I'm sorry, honey. I have some bad news about Dr. Bondurant.
His office just called.
What? I shouldn't go to my hour tomorrow?
No, no. It's more serious than that.
There was an accident sometime last night up by the highway.
He-- lost control or something, his car went off the road.
His car?
He's dead, Steph.
Sorry.
What happened?
Nobody knows.
Police say he lost control of his car.
Just one of those stupid unnecessary accidents.
He was my friend!
I know, baby.
He was a very special man.
In his own way, he helped bring us together.
And nothing is ever gonna split us apart.
Can I help?
Yeah, would you honey?
Thanks.
What do you think?
I like it!
Is it straight?
A little bit towards me.
Perfect!
- Jerry...
- Yeah?
I just wanna say that...
I know I've been a lot of trouble.
And I'm sorry...
Well, let's say we owe each other an apology and bury the hatchets.
Deal.
When I was a kid I went through some pretty rough times myself.
So, what happened?
I outgrew my problems and so will you.
Besides, you'll be too busy checking boyfriends.
Boyfriends?
Yeah, you know...
Boys, girls, dating.
He's so old fashioned.
Aren't you?
Guilty as charged, Your Honor.
There's plenty of time for that, sweetheart.
Don't try to grow up too fast, huh?
OK.
It'll be nice with a family of birds leaving in there.
Dear Lord, we thank you for the meal we're about to enjoy, for our dear friends, our wonderful home, but most of all, Father, we thank you for bringing us together as a family.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Oh... sweetheart, everything looks absolutely perfect.
What do you think of this turkey, Steph, huh?
Looks almost good enough to eat.
Yeah.
What do you say if we cut up this bird? Steph?
Light or dark?
Wait, wait, wait, let me guess.
You're the...
... drumstick-type.
Two drumstick-type.
You know?
Until this moment,
I never realized what
Thanksgiving was all about.
Well, if it isn't the Road Warrior!
- Come on, hop on.
- Looks dangerous...
- No, this bike is totally safe.
- I meant you.
Me? You are the dangerous one, you and that mean right hook.
Come on... Chicken.
Only if I get to drive.
So how come you're not with ever popular Kathy Lombardo tonight?
Kathy Lombardo is a stuck up bitch.
She dumped you!
No, no! I dumped her.
Alright, alright, she dumped me.
Come on! Watch where you're going. Easy.
We're OK now. You can stop holding on so tight.
Do I have to?
Not if you don't want to.
- I walk you up.
- OK.
Well, thanks for the ride.
- It's your bike.
- Right.
Well...
- Good night.
- Good night.
I-I- guess I'll see you in school, huh?
I guess so.
That's the Miller's dog.
Yeah.
Anyway-- er-- bye.
Bye...
You!
You could go to jail!
This girl is 16 years old!
- And so am I.
- Jerry. What's wrong?
This punk was trying to rape our daughter!
I just kissed her good night!
Stephanie? What's going on?
- Go home, Paul!
- Steph, are you sure?
Go home and I'll talk to you tomorrow...Go!
Would somebody please tell me what this is all about?
He kissed me good night.
I wanted him to.
I like Paul, Mom!
- Of course you do, honey...
- She's still a child!
I'm not a child!
Just 'cause you're a crazy demented about sex!
- Don't you talk to your father that way!
- He's not my father.
He's just some crazy creep!
How can you even bare to...
... let him touch you?
- Stop it!
He's your father now and you'll respect him!
Stephanie!
Stephanie, come back!
Let her go, Susan. She'll come back when she calms down.
What were you thinking of...
... making such a stupid scene?
- That punk was undressing her!
That's Paul Baker. I've known him longer than I've known you!
- Meaning what?
- All the progress we've made with Stephanie thrown away, just thrown away! by you!
I...
- Bye, Ron.
- Good luck. Take care.
- Good bye, Audrey, don't work too hard, uh? - Good luck!
Bye Sylvia, thanks for everything.
- Bye everybody!
- Bye, Jerry!
- We'll miss you, Jerry.
- Thanks, Mr. Grace.
- Good luck.
- Thanks for everything. Good bye.
Just listen to me. All I'm saying is that the guy just married again, to a divorcee with kids or a widow. I know him!
This guy can not live without a family.
- Now, you gotta help me!
- I don't have time.
Come on! All I'm asking for are copies of marriage certificates for the last year. How much time is that gonna take?
More time than I've got or care to spare.
Come back in a couple of weeks.
- I need them now!
- Good bye...
- Asshole.
- You're not qualified.
- What?
- To call him asshole.
It's an earned privilege. You have to know him for half an hour.
Well, perhaps you can help me here, Miss... Barnes.
I could. The question is: why should I?
Because the asshole wouldn't like it, and I would.
What do you say, Miss Barnes?
I say...
... you're qualified to call me Annie.
Ok.
Honey... honey!
They say this Dr. is one of the best. Have a good session, huh?
Miss Maine?
Miss Stephanie Maine?
Sorry, wrong office.
- Mr. Meredith?
- Yeah, that's me.
Sorry to have bothered you.
Thanks.
Over here.
This house was supposed to be empty. I'm sorry about that.
- Hi, I'm Bill Hodgkins.
- The man who phoned about the job?
- That's right.
- Roy Chesterton.
How'd you do?
- You ever sold insurance before?
- Back east in Pennsylvania.
If there's a policy I haven't sold
I'd like to know what it is.
Especialized in any one area?
Well, I'm pretty comfortable in all of them but if I have a personal crusade, it's family related policies, life insurance.
That's a toughy. People don't wanna think they're gonna die
- I know I don't.
- Death is always something that happens to someone else.
That's why I really believe that
I'm protecting the family.
I'm glad to hear you say that.
That's our main objective here.
Jerry?
We have to talk, honey.
About what?
About what?
About what is happening to our family.
I'm taking care of it.
By yourself?
Daddy is home!
Daddy is home!
- Daddy, Daddy!
- Look who's here!
- Yes?
- Hi! Is Gerald Blake home?
No. Was he supposed to show you a house?
He sells houses?
Yes, he does.
Can I help you?
No, I'll just drop by later.
See, I'm not even sure it's the same Gerald Blake.
Well, I can give him a message for you.
No, that's okay.
If it's the guy I know, I'd rather just surprise him.
- All right.
- Ok, thanks.
You're welcome.
Hi.
Hello.
I'm Bill Hodgkins. I've just rented the house next door.
So, we're neighbors.
I'm Dorothy Reinhard.
Welcome to Madison St.
Thank you.
Hard work.
Oh, the kids were supposed to do it, but... you know how kids are.
It's just you and the kids, then?
Yeah.
Jerry Blake, please?
I'm sorry but Mr. Blake is no longer connected with this agency.
There must be some mistake.
No, there isn't. I can give you his home number though. It's...
I know that number! I'm calling from that number.
I'm sorry, Madam, but Mr. Blake left several days ago.
Well, thank you very much.
- It's about time!
- Mrs. Fairfax?
Not for long. Put this in the trunk. I'm leaving now!
Is this him? Is this the guy?
Sure, I'm having an affair with the cab driver.
You let her in your cab and I'll break every bone in your body!
- I'm not a cab driver, okay?
- OK.
I just wanna ask you a question.
You ever seen this guy before?
The beard's new, but he looks like the guy who sold us this house.
- Muriel?
- Could be him.
He sells houses?
Yeah... that's right.
Hey, what the hell are you doing, buddy?
Hi, honey.
Where've you been?
Showing the Morton house to some folks from California.
- Don't lie to me, Jerry.
- What?
I called your office today.
I didn't get the message.
Of course you didn't. They said you stopped working there...
... several days ago.
- What?
The recepcionist said that you left!
That idiot!
That new girl can't...
Susan... I've never got anyone fired in my life, but that girl... I don't know...
- You mean you still work there?
Of course. Where else would I be?
I don't know! I just-I don't know what I thought. Sorry.
This is very upsetting. I hope
Grace is still there...
No, forget it, honey.
Forget it! She probably just-- got the name wrong or something.
Hodgkins! What's to get wrong?
What did you say?
What?
Wait a minute...
Who am I here?
Jerry... !
Jerry?
Jerry Blake. Thank you, honey.
You're alright, sweetheart?
Jerry?
Where are you going?
Susan! Susan, come here!
Come here!
A little order around here, huh!
Come on, Rinnie.
Come on, Rinnie. Come on, fella.
Come on, come on...
Come on, fella, come on...
Come see me, come on...
Here boy, here boy.
Yeah! That's my little fella.
That's a good Rinnie, that's a good Rinnie, yeah.
Oh, yes! Yeah, you're a good dog.
You're a good dog!
Mom?
Mom? you home?
Hey. What they do? Leave you alone?
You're a very bad girl...
Come on, move!
Come on! Come on!
Jim...
Jim Ogilvie!
That's-- blood.
Next time, Jim, call before you drop by.
Hi, pumpkin.
Steph...
Help! Somebody help me!
Help! Please!!
Somebody help me!
Help me! Help!
Open the door!!
Open the... damned... door!!
Oh, no!
No!
Help!
Come on down, Steph!
Steph!
It's ok, sweetheart, I won't hurt you.
Steph, come out here now!
Get out here!!
Steph.
Come on, honey.
Where are you, Steph?
Come on, honey, it's alright.
It's all a game, Steph, uh?
Come on, Steph, it was all a...
... misunderstanding!!
No!
- No!! Please!!
- Come to Daddy! Come here!
- Come here!
- No!! Please!!
Stephanie!
Stephanie!!
Stephanie!
Stephanie?
Mommy?
No, Jerry!
Stephanie, the knife!
Leave her alone!!
Stephanie!
Stop it!
I... I love you...
Was all of it for nothing?
See? They didn't accept me.
The psychiatrist said no. l'm not sicK.
What do l do now?
Tell me, please, what now?
This is Todd, and l can't come to the phone right now.
But don't hang up, okay? l hate these machines just as much as you do.
Anyway, leave a message after the beep, tell me why you called... and l swear to God l'll call you back, okay?
Wait for the beep. l called to see if you were home. l have to kill you tonight. l have to kill you tonight.
This is very auspicious, Dietz.
You're removing your uniform for the very last time.
Don't breaK my balls.
Did you hear that?
The guy maKes Detective, the first thing he does is turn on his old friends.
That's not true. l never liKed you guys.
-So who's coming?
-Where you going?
-Kelly's.
-You buying?
Yeah, why not?
-Let's bust him.
-Officer Dietz.
Yes, Lt. Cardoza.
Get that locKer cleared out?
Yes, Lt. Cardoza.
Put the show on the road.
ThanK you, Lt. Cardoza.
Bye, Archie.
Adiós, Dietz, good lucK. l'm telling you, don't worry about it. lt's probably just some wacKo.
Shit. You Know, that's what l'm afraid of.
LooK, l got a tape.
-You want this tape?
-No. lt's got his voice on it.
Give me the tape.
The investigators will call you in a couple of days.
-You tell them what you told me.
-A couple of days?
We've got a lot of worK.
We don't have a lot of people. lt'll taKe three or four days for them to get to your report.
Meantime, go home, locK your doors, go to sleep. lf the guy calls you, call us, all right?
Have a good night.
Here. lt's all right. lt's easy.
Let me help you.
There. lt's over.
What do you feel liKe for breaKfast?
Dying.
Come on, waKe up.
All right.
Detective Dietz, don't you looK handsome?
Corey! l'd love you to practice, but not first thing in the morning.
Good morning.
-What are you maKing?
-Avocado omelette.
How about sausage and peppers?
Sausage and peppers?
Next time your mom and dad come to visit.
Yeah, l don't even have the time.
You got plenty of time, taKe your vitamins.
No, l want to get there early. lntroduce myself to the guys.
Sam, can you do me a favour?
Just this once, try and remember... that you don't have to set the world on fire your first day. l Know, just be myself.
No. l said, you don't have to set the world on fire.
LiKe, be mellow?
Carol, that's so West Coast.
-Kid, never marry a girl from the West Coast.
-l don't liKe girls.
Well, don't marry a boy from the West Coast either.
Avocado omelette up. l gotta go. Be good, l love you.
-My hero, are you nervous?
-No.
A little. l thought so.
She does that to me all the time, too.
All right, Captain, l'm worKing on it right now.
-Why don't you quit smoKing, too?
-l'm trying. l thinK, beyond that, you got to go through Capt. BlaKely... except you don't wanna do that.
He's a jerK-off.
You're better off going through his secretary Francine, over there.
This is gonna be your desK.
Just scrape that shit off, put your stuff in the drawer.
Everybody, listen up.
This is Sam Dietz.
He's gonna be worKing with me now.
How're you doing?
Nice talKing to you.
Nice jacKet.
Malloy, homicide. Hollywood.
TaKe the rooKie with you.
RooKie?
Come on, let's go. l got a name, he calls me rooKie?
-ls that the jerK-off?
-No, that's another one.
-How many jerK-offs you got around here?
-Got exactly eight.
Hope you don't maKe nine.
Jeez, standing here reminds me.
Remember that one where the girl strangled her boyfriend... with a soap-on-a-rope? Were you on that?
No, that was Bob Connely. l was on that classy one.
The guy drowned his girl in the toilet.
-Yeah! Did you ever breaK that?
-No.
TaKe this to the lab.
Who is this guy?
MacAfee retired. This is my new partner.
Bulldog, what are you doing?
-ChecKing things out.
-Yeah?
Why don't you sniff around out there, see what you can find?
OKay.
What do you thinK these condos go for?
Find anything?
That Knife he was Killed with belonged to the victim.
He's got a whole set of them.
So?
So why would he get Killed with his own steaK Knife?
Maybe his girlfriend was a vegetarian.
His girlfriend wouldn't have to looK up his address and underline it.
Maybe he was a male hooKer, and he stumbled on a burglar.
Burglar? He's got a watch and a ring in plain sight on the dresser, Malloy.
Maybe the Killer was blind, but l'll bet you've got a better idea.
Better than a male hooKer with a vegetarian girlfriend... who finds a blind burglar in his bathroom, huh?
You've been a detective two hours, you've got all the answers?
Our boys said all the lights were on in the apartment.
-So the stiff was afraid of the darK.
-He sure was last night.
Now looK... the shower curtain's pulled bacK.
That's not the way he normally Kept it.
You're probably wondering how l figured that out. lf you Keep a plastic shower curtain pulled bacK... you get mildew in the folds.
No mildew.
How about that?
Now, this other thing is just a guess.
But l'm saying,
Todd comes into the apartment... he thinKs somebody else is here.
He gets a Knife, turns on all the lights, he comes in here.
He's looKing.
-He pulls the shower curtain bacK--
-Hold it.
He was behind the curtain.
You can practically see through this.
You can't hide behind something liKe that.
So where did he come from?
From out there.
Todd pulls it bacK, he doesn't find anybody.
He turns around, the Killer comes through the door, they scuffle.
Todd goes down just liKe that.
What do you thinK? This is a joKe?
Would you excuse us, please?
Let me tell you something about police worK.
All that stuff you just figured out so brilliantly is bullshit.
That's oKay, because most of what we do is bullshit.
But the bullshit that you just dumped on us is useless bullshit. lt doesn't help us.
ThanKs for your advice, old-timer.
KnocK off the old-timer stuff. l don't want a snot-nose for a partner.
Don't tell me l'm not helping.
You're not helping us. You wanna help us?
Tell us who the fucK this guy is!
What the fucK is with the phone booK?
Who the fucK Killed him?
How the fucK do l Know? lt's my first day.
That's right, it's your first day.
We all acted that way on our first day. lt's sort of a tradition.
Come on, let's get something to eat.
Eat? l thinK that we ought to get something to eat.
We wait for the lab report, the autopsy, the prints.
Then we maKe with the theories. l just feel liKe we ought to be doing something.
LiKe interrogating someone?
Yeah?
Excuse me.
What exactly was your relationship to the deceased?
All right.
We eat.
Hello?
Los Angeles Police Department.
We're sorry, all available lines are busy.
Stay on the line.
An officer will answer your call... in the order in which it was received.
Thank you. This message will repeat until an officer is available to help you.
Police Emergency. This is Officer Rosko.
May l help you?
Yes, l'd liKe to report a prowler. l believe l heard somebody....
Oh, my God!
Hello, ma'am, can you hear me?
Hello? Ma'am? ls it an emergency?
Are you having a medical emergency?
Hello?
Do you need help, ma'am?
Hello? Are you still on the line?
Ma'am, l'm sending a unit out right away.
No!
Yeah, taKe it.
That's it. lt's easy.
See?
Yes. lsn't that better?
So we went to the bathroom, and the body is lying on the floor... with a note on the chest.
Do we have to discuss this at dinner?
Sorry.
-Dinner's great.
-How's the roast?
Are you Kidding me?
Red meat instead of tofu? l thinK l died and went to heaven.
Well, it's a special occasion. lt's your first dinner as a dicK.
What's a dicK?
That's another word for detective.
How was your day?
ThanK you for asKing. lt was very good. l picKed up a new client.
No Kidding.
A little restaurant on Union, the RathsKeller.
They need a dozen ferns and a couple of trees. lt's gonna be cute.
Ferns? That's great.
All right. Sam, what happened then?
All right, so l'm trying to piece this thing together... get some clues.
This clown, all he wants to do is stand around and wait for the report to come in.
That sounds reasonable.
That's not how we did it in New YorK.
Honey, maybe that's how they do it in LA.
Did we checK the basement?
This broKen window here?
Son of a bitch!
-What time?
-Dispatch got the call at 6:48.
They traced it here 6:52.
First wheels got here about 7:22.
Come on. Did you get a load of this place? l bet it's worth $2.5 million if it's worth a nicKel.
Come on, what have we got here?
We got ourselves a stiff: Angela Taylor,
Caucasian, age 39. Occupation: songwriter. l actually caught her on
The Cosby Show once plugging her stuff.
She was a great-looKing broad.
Anyway, the guy comes in through the sKylight... chases her downstairs, strangles her with a piano wire...
-he sticKs her in a dryer.
-No, he didn't.
-He found her in the dryer.
-What, no mildew again?
No, she KicKed the shit out of the insides.
-You got anything over there?
-Not so far, l haven't.
Malloy, could you refresh my memory again?
Now tell me, what exactly are we waiting for?
What you always wait for in a goddamn homicide.
An eyewitness, a confession or the accumulation of a shitload of evidence.
-How about a sign from God?
-What, are you getting wise with me?
LooK, can l talK to you for a second?
Over here.
Let's go over here, away from all this.
What's up? l wanna get the hell out of here.
Malloy, let me tell you something.
When l was on the force in New YorK, we caught the Son of Sam.
You Know how we caught him?
500 guys busting their tail in 500 directions around the clocK.
One poor schlub had to checK out all the parKing violations... written near the murders on the slim chance... that the motherfucKer was parKed illegally while he was Killing people.
Then we had other poor schlubs, myself included... who had to follow up every one of those fucKing ticKets... and believe me, we thought it was one jacK shit waste of time... until two of our guys from YonKers found him.
And they busted that son of a bitch.
So don't give me this stand-around-and-wait bullshit, 'cause l don't buy it. l Know where you're coming from.
You thinK we're dragging our asses, you wanna do something constructive.
-You're right.
-Shit, oKay.
Capt. BlaKely's gonna want a report first thing in the morning.
What do you say you taKe that on?
-Yeah, it's better than nothing.
-OKay, great.
Just maKe sure it's good, because Capt. BlaKely...
Jesus, he's got high standards, just liKe you.
-How's it going?
-Good.
You've got a great big Knot bacK here.
What's the matter?
This thing tonight, this Taylor woman... she tries to hide, right?
Two feet from her is a toolbox with hammers, chisels, screwdrivers.
She could have beat the guy to a bloody pulp. lnstead she crawls inside of the dryer.
Not everybody is a fighter. l Know that, Carol, but if you act liKe a victim, you're gonna be a victim.
What's really bothering you? l really wanna do my job, and this guy's not letting me. lf you wanna do it so bad, you're going about it the wrong way.
But he's maKing me crazy. l can't seem to convince him to let me do what l can do.
You didn't tell him the Son of Sam story, did you?
You Know what you need?
What?
Come on, Carol, it's late.
Every time that you feel frustrated by Malloy... l want you to say something nasty to the plant. lnsult it, threaten its little life... and pretty soon it's going to be droopy... the leaves are gonna get brown.
You're gonna feel liKe you really accomplished something.
-Get it out.
-No, come on.
Now you try it. Give it your best shot, Sam.
Go ahead. Go on.
You eat shit.
That's not an insult to a plant. l hope you get root rot, you little fucK.
That's good. That's very good. l thinK l almost saw it starting to cringe there. l thinK l'm going to finish this report in the morning.
Very good idea.
Come in.
This report is excellent.
-You type this, Malloy?
-No, sir.
Detective Dietz typed it.
This is good. This is real good.
Nice margins.
Did you see this morning's Times?
''Police hunt Sunset Killer.''
You didn't give them that, did you?
No, sir.
All we told them was that there was no definite linK between the Killings.
The fact that they tooK place near Sunset Boulevard at sunset.
-Coincidence.
-What about the phone booK thing?
We didn't tell them that.
We were afraid of a copycat.
This lunatic is trying to show the world... that he can picK anybody at random from a phone booK and Kill them... and maKe us looK liKe idiots. l'd just as soon the world didn't get that message.
So let's Keep a lid on it, oKay?
Excuse me, Captain.
A little publicity might be just what we need here.
Those people are dead because they did exactly the wrong thing.
Maybe we should tell people. lf they thinK someone's in their home, get out.
Don't go looKing, don't maKe phone calls, don't hide.
Get out, then call us.
Maybe we could save some lives that way.
Maybe you'd liKe to worK the switchboard when we get 100,000 calls a night... to help little old ladies into their apartments.
You're exaggerating a little bit.
LooK, Dietz, if you argue with me... you're gonna find yourself worKing the airport.
Now, until l say otherwise, we Keep a lid on it.
Understand? Get out!
You Know what to do.
No, Captain, l don't Know what to do.
Try catching the son of a bitch.
FucKing moron.
He's the jerK-off. You're the fucKing moron.
-Where are you going?
-l'm going to taKe the jerK-off's advice.
He can't help it, he's from New YorK.
-What's that?
-lt's jaywalKing.
The other one, the Taylor woman?
She's clean.
Has either of them ever been under investigation for anything?
No. ln both instances, it appears that the victims were forced... to participate in their own deaths.
The wide Knife-entry wound on Mr. Arthur's body indicates a definite struggle.
As you can see, there are minute traces of latex we found on the piano wire.
So we figured he was wearing rubber gloves.
That's why there were no prints.
Francine, is there liKe a police psychiatrist or somebody liKe that?
You've only been on the job two days.
-lt's not for me.
-l Know.
-You want it for a friend.
-Yeah. l love you, don't ever change.
Dr. ParK? This is Detective Dietz, LAPD. l'd say that this guy is seriously fucKed up.
At last, somebody who speaKs my language.
So what else?
Two notes aren't a hell of a lot to go on, really.
These would indicate he's a taunter.
Extremely self-confident.
Very successful at whatever he attempts.
And he doesn't mind telling you just how successful he is.
You thinK we're gonna hear from him?
Without finding a body attached to one of those?
Probable, if Killing simply for the saKe of Killing begins to bore him.
Then you're saying that there's gonna be more.
Unfortunately, yeah.
You might wanna consider the victims.
A movie extra and a songwriter.
They're industry-related. l'm sorry, l'm getting into your territory now.
Believe me, l could use the help. lt's a tough one, Dietz.
Maybe he's just crazy. l could have said that.
But l get paid for it.
No, Carol, you go ahead and eat. l don't Know how late l'll be.
Yeah, l'm trying to.
All right, l love you, too. l thought we discussed this.
What are you doing still dressed?
Arthur, you are my boss.
OKay, let's see what's hidden behind door Number 1 .
LooKy, what have we got here?
Here's a little something for you. l'll go get something for the both of us.
Phone rings, don't answer it.
Arthur, don't taKe too long.
She's hot to trot. l'll write it off.
Yes!
Arthur, what's taKing so long?
Don't be afraid. l'll help you. lt's easy.
Yes.
Arthur, l'm waiting!
Get in here now, Arthur! l want you now.
You taKe too long, Arthur. lf you want me now, you'll have to force me.
See?
You did it.
That's good.
Ernie! How are you?
Can you give me something for the 1 1 :00? l'll snoop around and let you Know.
-Carmen, you looK beautiful.
-Hiya, cutie.
What does a condo liKe this go for?
Hey, early bird. Who's the mystery victim?
Read this. No clues, no nothing.
-What is it?
-The asshole left it.
You're Kidding.
''Where are police when you really need them?''
Funny.
-Funny. Heard there was a girl.
-Yeah, and our friend Killed her, too.
LooK, l hope you don't thinK this is useless bullshit...
-but isn't there something strange?
-Hold on a second.
-Arthur Taylor?
-Yeah.
Todd Arthur.
Angela Taylor. lt's as plain as the nose on your face.
What is?
Arthur Taylor. This is the guy we're really after. Come on.
Let's go talK to the news people.
Anybody talKs to you, just say,
''No habla inglés. ''
-Yeah, sure.
-Good Kid.
Just hold off on the name thing for 48 hours... and l promise to give you everything we've got.
What time did the attacK taKe place?
-What time?
Who are you Kidding?
You won't go on record that this was another Sunset murder?
No comment.
You're calling it that, we're not.
Does this looK liKe Sunset Boulevard?
What are you trying to do? Start a panic?
-Do you have a description of him?
-No.
Shit!
What are you so grumpy about? l thinK you're wrong.
And you don't wanna listen.
This guy is a psychopath. l'm not arguing with you.
He's a psychopath.
-No, l don't thinK he's gonna stop.
-He'll stop when we nail him.
-You just don't give a shit!
-Who the hell is raining on your parade?
You are, man.
Sam?
You thinK l handled that well? l love you.
What do you want me to say? No? l felt liKe punching the guy's lights out because he just won't listen.
Have you tried being reasonable? l mean, just sitting him down and discussing it calmly with him?
Sure, you Know me.
Yes, l do Know you, and that's why l'm asKing.
We've been through this same thing before, remember?
No, that was different.
Cardoza was a jerK-off.
You said that this new guy is a jerK-off.
That's a different jerK-off.
Until you learn how to deal with these jerK-offs... you're never gonna get what you want, Sam.
-Hi, sweetie.
-Hey, you little snoop.
-Hi, Dad.
-What are you doing out of bed? l couldn't sleep. l want to hear you tell what you did today.
Story time's over.
Why don't you go bacK to bed?
No.
-Corey, darling--
-l'll handle this.
You're looKing for a KnucKle sandwich if you don't move.
Good job, boss.
Sweetheart, l Know that you love to hear your daddy's stories... but it's not polite to listen to people talK when they don't Know you're there, is it?
But we'll forgive you, if you'll run off... get right bacK into bed and have sweet dreams, oKay?
-Night-night, honey.
-Good night.
Reasonable.
-l could have done that.
-Do it with Malloy. l'll buy him some Roger Rabbit jammies.
Dad, what's a jerK-off?
AsK your mother.
Mom, what's a jerK-off?
Bed!
Don't give me nougies.
You go bald that way.
Yeah? lf you say, ''l told you so,'' l'll bust you in the chops.
-He hit again last night. Twice.
-What?
Yeah. l just got the call.
Connely's already on it.
- ou there?
-Yeah.
Why don't l come by and pick you up?
You wanna picK me up? Why?
You Know, carpools save energy.
Give us a chance to talk.
OKay, bulldog.
Guess what the two stiffs had in common?
What?
They're both named Arthur Taylor.
We made the papers.
''Hollywood division detectives
Bill Malloy and Sam Dietz...
''refused to disclose anything regarding the double murder at the scene.
''Police officials will neither confirm nor deny...
''that this latest crime was the work of the so-called Sunset killer.
''But Detective Malloy did call the murders.:
'''the senseless acts of a sick mind. '''
By the way... l understand the nutcase pen pal sent us a hot note.
What?
Something liKe,
''l'm getting closer, are you?''
How many more Arthur Taylors are there in the phone booK?
-l'm way ahead of you.
-Maybe we should see if they're still alive. l already called it in. lf they are, we ought to tell them
Tijuana is nice at this time.
That's a good idea.
Malloy, one other thing. lt's been bothering me a little bit. l don't wanna spit in the face of modern science... and l don't wanna challenge your authority or experience... but l thinK it's time we taKe after this guy. l Knew this couldn't last. Jesus Christ.
What do we Know about him?
He's good at breaKing in and Killing.
Why don't we get a couple poor schlubs, liKe in the old days... sit down at a file cabinet... start pulling jacKets on murders, assaults, burglaries, prowlers, escaped lunatics?
How about escaped lunatics with parKing ticKets?
My wife is going to be very upset if this reasonable crap doesn't worK.
-Your wife is going to be upset?
-Yes. Come on, give me a breaK.
All right, Kiddo. l'll call Capt. BlaKely.
He'll recruit us some slubs.
-Not slubs. Schlubs!
-Whatever.
-Arthur Taylor?
-Yeah.
We'd liKe to asK you a few questions.
Do you mind if we come in?
-Do l have any what?
-Any enemies, Mr. Taylor.
-Do you have any enemies?
-Hell, yes, l got enemies. l got hundreds of them, probably even thousands. l wouldn't even Know where to begin.
-You want some prunes?
-No, thanKs. Never touch them.
For a man your age, they're very good for you.
Mr. Taylor, we don't wanna upset you... but maybe there's somebody you could stay with for a while.
-Are there people you could stay with?
-You mean broads?
How about family? l'll bet they'd love to have you.
You Know something? You're an asshole.
And you're full of shit.
And you're a bastard.
What the hell?
Now that we Know each other, l may as well throw up my hands.
-l'll go.
-Attaboy.
Yeah, I'm telling you.
Real estate in LA went up 30% last year.
-That house is worth $200,000, minimum.
-For that Kind of money bacK east... you get a lot more than a little house with no bacKyard.
BacK east, my ass.
You liKe it so much there, why don't you buy this grumpy place?
Living in a tenement liKe this would maKe you feel right bacK in the Big Apple. lt's open.
Arthur Taylor?
LooK, we're police officers.
Can we talK to you for a minute?
Sorry to waKe you up.
There's a possibility you may be in some danger.
Do you have any enemies, anybody who would harm you?
What?
Do you have any enemies?
Am l in danger?
Someone's been Killing people with the same name as you.
Maybe you saw somebody following you, or hanging around.
No, sir.
Just the same... is there somebody you can stay with for a while, just until we catch him?
Why can't you catch him?
Believe me, we're trying.
When you catch him, what are you gonna do?
That's for the courts to decide.
You're gonna Kill him, aren't you? lKe Taylor? Jesus Christ, lKe!
Little BucK.
You're not BucK, are you?
Goddamn, lKe Taylor! Hell of a cop! lnspirational.
That's right, a real inspiration.
What a guy.
-How come you're not on the job?
-They wouldn't taKe me.
They wouldn't taKe you, lKe Taylor's Kid?
Their loss.
BucK. lt's BucK, right?
Boy, this is some cannon you got.
You Keep it real nice and clean.
You got a license for it?
Yeah, sure you do.
So you say you got no people you can stay with for a few days? l'm a police officer, and l can't advise you to use this weapon.
But if you're staying here....
Let me put it this way. l Keep mine right in that drawer, right next to my bed.
You Know what l'm saying? l don't wanna freaK you out.
He's just very dangerous.
Dangerous? He's a fucKing maniac. lf you need us, you can call us at this number.
You asK for me, Detective Dietz, or Detective Malloy.
Dietz, and you're Malloy.
Bill Malloy. Kid, come here.
-You need anything, you call me. All right?
-Yes, sir.
BucK, you grew up.
-You Keep your door closed from now on.
-Yes, sir. l hope he'll be all right.
Any son of lKe Taylor can taKe care of himself.
He was the meanest, toughest son of a bitch l ever met.
So what ever happened to him?
Liberals said that we had to start burping the criminals that we nailed.
They said that lKe was too dangerous for the streets.
So lKe said, ''FucK it.''
Don't looK at me liKe that. lt's not my fault the cops are stupid.
What do you want from me?
Listen.
No?
FucK.
You're right.
You're always right.
Not this way.
They have to do it.
Let's just say l heard about you and Lt. Cardoza not getting along. lt's just that l worKed for him for three years... during which he tried to get me thrown off the force.
-Yeah? Did he have a good reason?
-Yeah, he's a rat bastard.
No shit. Also a pretty goddamn good cop.
Sure. All you old farts sticK together.
Hey, wise guy. l'm tired of all this bullshit about an old man.
Go find a younger fucKing partner.
-Bill, l'm sorry.
-Balls.
LooK, give me a breaK. l don't wanna be jerK-off Number 9.
Come on.
-How's it going?
-How's it looK, gramps?
-What did you say?
-You're a little testy there, aren't you, man? l'd liKe to meet the brain donor who came up with this bullshit idea.
You're looKing at him.
You don't liKe it, Kiss my ass.
All right, come on. Girls, easy!
Come on.
What my partner meant to say was... you're doing a fine job, and we Know it's thanKless and boring.
But we're depending on you.
So please, stay with it, oKay?
Yeah, oKay.
-What's your name?
-Terrell. lt's nice to meet you, Terrell.
Hang in there.
When this case is over, l'm gonna rip his lungs out.
FucK him and the horse he rode in on.
What are you laughing at?
Shit. Underneath it all, you're just as big an asshole as l am.
Yeah, but l hide it better than you.
You're a bad influence on me.
-How's that?
-You're maKing me give a damn.
There's about 1 2 million people in LA... and a million of them are bona fide committable.
And out of that million,
200,000 are probably dangerous.
And of that 200,000, one of them decides it's open season on people.
One of them, Sam, against you and me.
But we're gonna find him.
Sam, here. TaKe a looK at this.
-That's you and Lasorda!
-Yeah. lt's the annual police benevolent game at Dodger Stadium. l got no hits and a plate of pasta.
That's a great shot, man.
-What position did you play?
-Third base.
Yeah?
-Can you still maKe that throw?
-Better when they moved me to second. lt was humiliating.
To baseball, the ultimate game. l used to liKe it.
What do you mean, used to?
Baseball is liKe life. l'm a tracK horse rounding third base, trying to slide home safe.
And you're trying to maKe rooKie of the year. l did love it. l used to sit in the bleachers with my father.
Campy, the DuKe. l Knew 'em all.
You Know my favourite? Gil Hodges.
He used to hit a home run, he'd cross home plate and blow his wife a Kiss. l loved them so much, and then they fucKing moved to LA.
They broKe my heart.
Son of a bitch.
That's why you have a hard-on against LA.
You Know what you gotta do?
You gotta see a ball game.
-No.
-Yeah, you do. l got two ticKets. Opening day.
Third base line, right behind the dugout.
You come with me. l'll introduce you to Lasorda. l gotta go home. l appreciate the offer. l'll see you in the morning.
You and me, opening day? You're on.
Right, you're on.
You Know, Malloy, l always had you figured for a catcher. l catch a lot of shit from you, that's for sure.
What are you doing here?
Come on in.
Close the door behind you.
Just getting myself a beer.
How did you find my address? ln the phone booK.
My father said l was sicK... once.
Sir... what's it liKe?
Corey.
Time-out.
Why don't you help your mother with dinner? l don't want to.
When l was a Kid, l used to help my mother with dinner.
That way, l made sure l got the smallest portion of spinach.
-You Know what l'm saying?
-OKay.
-Would you chop up these cucumbers?
-No problem.
Hello?
Just a moment. Sam, it's for you.
Carol, this reasonable stuff, it worKs.
-Yeah?
-Dietz, it's Blakely. Malloy's been killed.
-How?
-Shot in the heart.
No. l just left him. ou better get over there right away.
Yeah, l'll be right there.
Somebody Killed Malloy.
-Oh, my God. Do you thinK it has anything--
-No, there was no note.
You and Corey should spend the night at your mother's.
No.
-We don't Know what this guy might do.
-We don't. l'm not gonna run and hide every time a criminal is loose... just because you're on the case.
All right. Stay inside, maKe sure everything's locKed.
You Know where the gun is.
Shit!
What does that mean?
Malloy called the guy sicK in the newspapers.
PacK a bag. You're going to your mother's.
Do it! lt's just for tonight.
You come bacK in the morning.
You're a dead man.
You're a fucKing dead man.
Here's the MO report, sir.
-l'm really sorry about Bill.
-l Know you are.
Carmen, l need your help.
All right.
But what l'm gonna tell you is against the rules.
Corey, go get your schoolbooKs.
-Good morning.
-You got the paper? lf it's safe now, why wasn't it safe last night?
He doesn't worK days.
She did it.
-What?
-Listen to this.
''ln the waKe of last night's murder of LAPD detective Sergeant Bill Malloy...
''police psychologist Dr. Lyndon ParK has provided a profile of the Killer.
''He's an anally fixated, sexually impotent, socially inept individual...
''who's using homicide...
''as a means of hiding his own feelings of inadequacy or worthlessness.'' l can't believe that a psychologist would say that. l just hope he believes it.
And you'll probably be there waiting for him.
Praying for him.
Keep your eyes open.
Let's catch this psycho.
-Can l talK to you?
-Dietz, l was just gonna call you.
Your new partner's WicKer.
He's got something on Fairfax, go with him.
-What about the Sunset murders?
-You're not worKing that anymore.
See WicKer.
What do you mean, l'm not worKing that anymore? l mean, the shit hit the fan. l'm turning it over to some guys who have more than three days' experience.
-Would you listen to me for a second?
-No. l have to put together a tasK force this morning... for a news conference this afternoon. l don't care about news conferences, because l need men for a staKeout.
You don't need men, l need men.
You need ears.
Now for the last time, get the hell out of my office!
Sam Dietz? Art WicKer.
Dr. ParK, this is Dietz. l'm leaving for your house right now.
Dietz? l'm looKing forward to worKing with you.
See you tomorrow.
What's going on?
And Wills and Chico in 510.
King and Eagle in 407.
What the hell do you thinK you're doing? l hate your fucKing guts as much as you hate mine... but why haven't your men responded to our order?
-What order?
-Don't give me that, you asshole!
Four men, all-day staKeout, remember?
What staKeout?
Why, you son of a bitch, l got a sitting target with no protection... all because you got this hard-on for me. l don't Know what you're talKing about. l never got an order for four men. l short faxed this morning.
-Who sent it?
-BlaKely sent it.
Let's call BlaKely and see what he has to say.
Good idea, do it.
He's a reasonable man. He'd wanna hear how you screwed up so bad.
Give me four men.
Spencer, Marra, Furillo, and Snowden.
Don't worry, l'll Keep a lid on it.
All right, here's what we got.
So far, he's strucK early evening, around 6:00 or 7:00.
But just in case, Keep on your toes.
Spence, let me show you around for a minute.
-Are these bozos any good?
-Yeah, Snowden used to be with SWAT.
-Good.
-The other two, they're sort of new.
Terrific. You let me taKe Snowden and one more. You taKe the other one outside.
Hey, guys. He's very resourceful.
So don't go looKing for him
KnocKing on the front door.
Furillo, come with me.
My aching balls.
For a sitting ducK, you're a pretty cool customer. l Know a lot of guys who'd be shaKing in the closet.
Before we go into practice, we always undergo analysis ourselves.
Keeps us on balance, in touch with reality.
-Sort of practice what you preach?
-Yes.
What the hell is with that?
Psychiatry, Sam, isn't always preaching.
Sometimes it's persuasion.
Detective Dietz, please.
This is Officer Terrell. l'm sorry, he's not in right now.
Can l taKe a message?
41 29. OKay.
WicKer, where's Dietz? l don't Know.
He split and said he'd be bacK tomorrow.
So Carmen, over at the news... she printed it just like l told her.
You made it up?
Every word.
All by yourself?
No, Dr. ParK helped me with the big words.
Jesus, how did you ever get it approved? l haven't actually done that yet.
What?
You should have seen the trip l laid on Cardoza.
Shit, Dietz.
You'll get your ass in a sling over this.
Spence, l'd settle for that on this one.
You get down there and looK at the fax log, and then looK at the dupe sheets... and if you don't find it there, get BlaKely on the phone.
We'll raise some hell.
-Got it.
-Great.
This is Terrell again. ls Dietz bacK yet?
Sorry, Terrell, nobody seems to Know where he is. Bye.
Stay on your toes, guys.
Goddamn lying little pricK.
Yeah, this is Lt. Cardoza for Capt. BlaKely.
He did what?
That son of a bitch!
You're goddamn right, l'm gonna pull him.
Where is he?
Francine, get in here!
Dr. ParK.
Hello?
Dr. ParK.
Dietz, is that you?
What the hell are you doing?
WorKing.
You're about to experience crucifixion.
Blakely wants you to send those men back, and he wants you in right now. l can't do that, because l'm not here, and you didn't talK to me.
Oh, man.
Francine, please. l thinK l can get the guy that nailed Malloy.
But l need your help. Don't tell BlaKely. l can't help you, Dietz.
Because you're not there, and l haven't talKed to you.
Good lucK.
Attagirl.
We got a guy on the corner with a blue jacKet.
He's moving east.
LooKs to me liKe a high-ranKing government official.
He's probably waiting for a homosexual rendezvous.
Now he stops.
Nice try.
He's talKing to himself.
No, the boyfriend's not there.
He's walKing the other way.
We've got a lady with a baby carriage.
They're on the north side.
Might be concealing a small nuclear device.
And the baby carriage goes away.
Dr. ParK.
Dietz, it's me, Terrell.
-Who?
-Officer ''Kiss my ass'' Terrell.
Yeah.
Jesus, l've been trying to get a hold of you all day.
You remember the first victim that got Killed? Todd Arthur?
The night that he got killed, he came to the station to the report a death threat. lt was a message on his answering machine.
And you'll never believe this.
Listen, he even brought in the tape, and we got it.
-So what does it say?
-lt's not what he says. lt's how he says it.
Hold on. Wait a second. l called to see if you were home. l have to kill you tonight.
Terrell, play it again. l called to see if you were home. l have to kill you tonight. lt's him.
Spence, l thinK l Know where he is.
You stay here, in case l missed anything.
He's on the second floor, and he's armed.
He's already Killed one cop.
Tell me if you got a better way. l say l'll taKe the front stairs, you taKe the bacK... we meet on the second floor, l'll get out the bait.
Sounds all right to me, l guess.
What do you mean, you guess?
You were on the SWAT team.
That's Snowden, not me. l've never been on a SWAT team.
Shit.
Maybe we should call for bacKup?
Unfortunately, l can't do that.
Hello, how are you?
Just taKing a walK in the parK here.
No problem.
How are you, dear?
Yo, brothers, what's up?
Shit, checK it out.
Sam, come here. TaKe a looK at this.
Call it in.
LooK at this, there's a page missing.
-What letter?
-D-l-E--
Call my house. That's 555-9950.
Tell them to get out of there right now, and you call for bacKup.
Hello?
Hello, Mrs. Dietz?
Yes, operator, this is a police emergency. l need an intercept on 555-9950.
-How was your day?
-Pretty good.
-Was it good?
-Yes.
-Do you have a lot of homeworK?
-No.
-You sure?
-Yes.
Good. 'Cause you're gonna do it right away, or you don't watch any TV tonight.
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.
Yeah.
Please, don't hurt my son.
What do you want? l want you to sit.
Come on.
Excuse me.
My name is Carol.
And you're?
Waiting for you.
May l sit in this chair?
Yes.
Do you have a name?
You can call me BucK.
Young BucK.
That's a nice name. ls there anything that l can do?
-Where are you going?
-l just want some juice. l'll get you some juice, sweetheart.
No.
You sit.
-l'm sitting.
-That's nice.
Let's go get you some of that juice. lt's a 9-millimeter semi-automatic.
You can do just about anything with this gun.
See, the safety is on right now.
-So if you pull the trigger--
-Corey.
Honey, don't play with the gun.
The safety is on. l love you.
Do you have enough juice?
Yeah.
BucK... l'll do anything.
Please... what do you want?
Let me help you.
You can't.
Safety off.
You don't want to hurt us.
BucK, it's not funny anymore.
Do you?
No.
No, don't hurt yourself.
-Or this one?
-No.
Arthur!
Corey! Come to me!
Dad! lt's all right.
Stay there.
-Do l have to go to school tomorrow?
-No.
What do they do with dead bodies?
God taKes care of them.
You oKay?
You Know, it was your idea to move to LA.
You wanna give New YorK another try?
No, too much crime.
Jim, taKe a looK at this.
You believe this Kid did all those Killings?
Did you see the closet?
Did you see how much firepower he had in there?
He had enough firepower to start World War lll.
The sicKest thing is, his father was a cop.
Bring it back!
Do we pull it out?
It's too deep, bring it back!
Don't move!
Griffin, wake up!
What did I do?
We called you, shout at you and you didn't wake!
Griffin!
It's the fourth time this week!
When will you get out of the water?
A cathedral...
...people...
...digging in the earth.
Aw, Griffin!
No, it's true!
It's true! it's true!
Griffin is dreaming...
He's out of his head.
No, no. Let the old men first.
Where did they start?
Do not forget the peddler who was here on Monday last...
"If it finds you at breakfast... and you're dead by noon", he sais.
It's Connor I'm worried about.
If something is abroad,
Why isn't he back yet?
It's been too long.
I'll find him.
Tomorrow I'll go.
Whatever is out there...
...they don't know him.
Griffin...
...the sun is on the west wall.
You're going to be late!
Dreamers will be cold in rags, Griffin.
Leave the Griffin alone.
Wasn't the one you had up there big enough?
There's been enough ill fortune come down on this house for ten families.
If the sickness gets this far we'll need something to protect us.
You're overdoing it.
Come on, it is big enough.
You'll be the leader of the herd, Griffin.
Go on, hurry.
Go on, don't you get cold now boy.
- Cumbria, March 1348 -
This one comes out of the earth, carrying people.
Growing closer.
Do you remember the peddler who brought us the faggots?
"By the hundreds", he said...
"They were falling dead without warning".
To die, I don't like it.
Chrissie!
Go on, Griffin.
If Connor comes,
Chrissie will let you know.
Go down on it, Griffin.
Connor's kinda sharp, he knows the ways of the wild.
Are you right there now?
Off you go.
Down to Hell. The finding of it.
So, how many days has he gone now?
It's work that drives away the worry.
If we put each a spike on our roofs, we'll all be protected.
There's talk about places that Death just keeps tripping over...
An offering to God is making them safe.
An offering would mean a journey, wouldn't it Searle!
We'd take it off to the big cities.
You?
We'd draw back the curtain.
We'd show us the holy rights,
Saint Augustin's finger bone...
And feathers from Archangel Gabriel.
Nothing's been outside of the village before.
None of us have.
And nobody would want to neither.
Look at Connor...
He's still not back.
I start to fear.
I don't want to be in his shoes.
Griffin!
It's Connor!
Go on.
Connor!
Wait! Wait, Griffin.
We're coming up.
Easy! Hold on, Griffin.
Connor!
Easy!
Connor!
Come on, Chrissie!
Faster!
Come on, Chrissie!
Griffin!
Connor!
Connor, you're back! It's a miracle!
Look at them: you'd think they were married.
Tomorrow I would have gone and find you.
How would you been doing that?
I would fly like a bird and I would ask for help for the trip.
You would, eh?
You won't go away like that no more,
Connor, will you?
No, never. Never.
Look.
It is a new method for counting your devotions
They're made out of oak for great lords
Rosewood for rich ladies.
This one's made from sandalwood.
It is a craggy tree, small and tough.
Reminded me of someone.
It's the same tree they makes axes from.
Axes of wood.
If I am a big wheel on the move...
It's because it's you in my heart.
You and Linnet.
Connor!
Look, here she comes.
Connor!
If you had not come back...
I can feel it growing, Connor.
It's already 8 months gone now.
God, I do not know what I would have done if you'd not...
The dog's nose started to bleed and we couldn't stop it.
We thought it was a sign.
We felt for sure that you were lost.
Con'!
Searle! Martin!
Connor, you're back!
It's so strange to see people smiling.
What's happening out there, Con'?
We've heard the stories.
We've got to do something, yes!
We could meet tonight.
Hurry! Hurry!
There's a powerful evil on the move...
Connor has seen it.
A pestilence which makes haste in the full moon, he says...
Do we fear it or do we plan?
Tell them, Arno!
A week back, a monk crossed the lake.
He spoke of a great church being built into West.
He says it's highest in all Christendom.
There's pilgrims come from everywhere.
You make an offering, you stop the Death.
No, the church is too far!
It's beyond further reaches are left off here.
Across mountains, across seas... across places that aren't names for them.
We got to go, Searle, there's pilgrims on every road.
With Connor's to lead the party, we'll do it.
He knows the outside world better than anyone of us.
What do you say, Connor?
I've seen pilgrims, Martin.
I've seen so many bodies there weren't enough living to bury the dead.
I've seen mobs chasing monks from their abbeys for refusing last rights to dying.
It's the same monks that head West as pilgrims might.
They're people no more than animals.
You can trust no one.
Children... begged me for food.
I didn't dare go nearer.
And black boils under their armpits ready to burst and they denied plague was upon them.
All the churches are empty.
And still not satisfied, the evil keeps striding forth with each full moon.
We've got a month maybe two, with a scrap of God's grace.
We could do it.
Reach the church and raise a spike of Cumbrian copper.
With you or Searle to lead our party.
I deserve this chance.
Show the faith.
Here's to taking it! Our journey!
Then Searle must do it...
I am sick of all the death.
Intruders in the lake!
Con'! Come on!
I never thought I'd see the day where you'd stay put.
Now you are among friends.
Don't touch!
We must defend our village.
In the lake!
They defy the village!
Are they armed?
Hey! Look!
Lost looters.
No, there's women and children on board.
Refugees from the East.
They're scared, scared of the Death.
Somebody gather the spears.
It's best to keep'em out of ourselves.
I heard a story once.
In the old pit on the isle of mine.
They reckon there's a hole up there
So deep that if you'd dropped a stone down it, sooner or later
It will fall out the far side of the Earth.
The copper... An offering.
We've got to take the offering, Con'!
To the great church, to the far side of the Earth
Look.
There is no time for your journey, Martin.
It's the plague.
They have the Death and...
It's too late.
It will be up to 20 miles long for Gostford in the morning.
It's full moon, bears its contagion for it like a sac.
As sunrise she lets it fall... on us.
Help!
Griffin! Griffin! What is it?
Are you all right?
Griffin! What's wrong?
- Wake up Griffin!
- Griffin!
Griffin, wake up!
- Griffin!
- Wake up!
What's wrong, Griffin?
The seam, the pit.
In the dream we were tunneling through to the furthest part of the Earth.
You're hearing the clouds again, Griffin?
Leave him. There's signs within dreams, he's been right before.
Like last year's Con'?
The vein of copper in the pit?
Have you forgotten?
Will we do the journey then?
Agreed. I'm with you then.
It's our only chance.
Come on!
And Griffin comes too.
So I carry the cross, eh?
Why should always men carry the weight?
Hey, Ulf! Ulf!
There's a church at the far reaches of the Earth.
It is the greatest in the world.
The pilgrims say that it's there.
And that's this place I will leave the Virgin.
And I will put it there myself, for you, mother.
Ulf!
Ulf!
I'm coming, Searle!
Don't go! Don't go without me!
Wait! Wait!
Keep the fire burning.
We'll be back soon!
Ulf, come on, hurry up.
Always to the front or too far behind.
What is it?
It's what I told you before.
We're tunneling through the Earth.
All of us.
We are using a engine.
The engine is going to shaft for breaking the rock and dirt.
The engine you see, it mixes fast enough...
...to be there before the moon turns full.
The moon struck you daft.
Not, it is true. I saw it in dreams.
And I keep seeing it.
And I am sure that the big black hole is there too.
Come out here! Come on! Hurry!
What the hell?
I think you got a son sleepwalking, Searle.
But I've never been down here before.
You know that, Con'.
So...
It is just like in your dream.
To the other side of the Earth.
We follow the torch.
It's blown by the wind.
It's come from the other side of the Earth.
We use the machine to tunnel.
Take it, take it.
Move back!
Out!
Keep it going!
Keep it going!
More rocks.
There, go!
We must keep moving.
Faster than the moon!
We're not yet on the other side.
But hurry. There she comes.
We must hurry or the village is lost.
Griffin, to be able to break through to the other side of the Earth, that's just two days digging...
...Without the sky, like we have to cling like a tick.
It is further than we thought.
Three times the length of your rope, Arno.
No, all of six times that length.
Before we struck the last hard rock between us and the far side of the world.
Come on now!
There it goes!
Again!
Look!
What is it?
What's that smell!
It's tunnel.
Tunnels under the soil.
Only great cities have them.
Underground sewers where every household can empty its bucket.
My God! It's huge!
Whatever city is up there must be... vast!
I'll go!
Hold your horses.
Not, it's allright. I'll be able to tell them where we are.
Connor, put the rope to him just to be safe. I mean, you never know.
This will help you with the air, Griffin. to find out if the air is poisonous or full of contagion.
God speed.
Griffin!
Griffin!
Griffin!
Griffin.
Griffin!
Griffin!
I can see the sky!
The sky!
All the skies above!
We're here!
We are there.
Come on, let's go up.
Searle, Searle.
Searle, I am afraid.
I am afraid.
It's alright. Come on.
It is as if it was on fire.
Hundred thousands fires.
Torches.
Think how much wood they need for all that.
That's the city.
The city I kept seeing in my dreams.
Lights, water, trees, grasses.
It's all fixed down to earth.
God's goodness!
It makes sense.
Everything flat's got two sides.
And if the evil is our side...
...Then surely God is on this one.
It has to be God's city, alright.
Can you see its great church?
No.
No?
What do you mean, no?
I can't see it.
Nothing is higher than a church spire. surely you can see it.
Searle, in big cities the buildings are higher than a man can see over.
But the boy surely must know where it is.
Come on Searle. Let's go.
Just remember, Con'... there's a run of ill fortune struck our family these past years.
It is enough, we have to take care.
But it must be God's city.
There's so much light...
Where is Ulf? Ulf!
I am here, don't leave me behind.
I've always had to stay at home.
So I'm glad to get a chance to journey out a bit.
You see, I've got something special.
A Lady of wood.
Say, it was my secret!
The little Virgin my mother gave us before she passed on.
I'll put her in the cathedral for her myself.
Con', can you see me placing her as an offering for my mother then?
I am sure I keep remember as we go along, you know.
Searle, come on.
Let's just get on with it.
So pretty.
So pretty.
Ulf!
Ulf, you get back, don't cross here.
For God's sake.
Ulf!
Come here brother!
Give me your hand.
Get in here, by Christ!
- What is going on?
- My little Virgin, I lost it!
Griffin, do we cross that?
I don't remember.
Do we go across lights?
- Griffin?
- Yes.
Come on then, everybody together, then we're strong. Are you ready?
Searle.
The Virgin.
Go.
Wait.
Ulf?
Where is Ulf?
- Ulf!
- You're supposed to come with us!
By Jesus all blessed to me!
Listen to me!
Nothing on your side, you get to the middle. I'll take it from there.
I'll kill the bastards if they try to stop me.
Take it back first. Come on.
It's alright, Ulf. Stay right back.
Con'.
God's speed, Griffin.
We separate here.
I'm going to go on to the cathedral.
We'll never have time to raise the spire if we stay together.
I will travel faster if I'm alone, I can have everything done by the time you arrive.
- You will not leave my brother.
- It is all for the village, Searle.
You take charge here, find the foundry... get that spike cast and get it to the cathedral.
Come on, let's everybody just do what they have to do.
Connor, no!
Take charge?
Find the foundry?
In this place?
All you have to do is use your nose.
Even in big cities you can smell the foundry.
Stench in the wind, still a coarse.
But you take care of the boy, Searle.
Connor!
You promised.
- You swore you'd never leave.
- Move away from me.
Connor's gone, he could be lost.
The city is so big Martin, so queer.
Don't fret, Griffin.
He's the only one who's right for all of us.
And however big the city...
...There's only one church.
He hit me.
Ulf!
Wait for me.
I come back for you, I swear it.
Do you hear me Ulf?
We'll come by on our way back.
Don't leave me.
Griffin.
If there are things in your dream that can help us, keep us out of danger, you got to make sure we know about them.
If we could have kept Ulf from walking into that...
I didn't know!
I can't know about everything!
But if you do know something you'd better let us know about all!
Oh Christ! Bloody Eric!
The bastard didn't even stop.
What's all this then?
Hare bloody Krishna?
They look like they've been in the bush for a while.
The kid's alright.
I smell a toad.
The stench in the wind.
What the hell?
Connor, I've got one.
Foundry.
Griffin, come here.
Foundry.
Nothing broken.
Don't worry, lad.
You're only the last in a long series of accidents.
Hey, Tom.
Come on, we'll dress this in the shop.
Blacksmiths.
We brought copper.
We shield out of the butt, aren't you boy?
Copper, cast it. Now.
Connor said that you'd cast the spike.
You've got to help us or the village is lost.
Please, cast it.
Do you understand these beggars?
Copper?
Ay, Ay, copper. You must cast it for us.
Careful, Arno. There's no pedal!
Smithy. You've got to help us.
Please, Smithy.
Cast the spike.
If it's casting you're after?
Sorry, son, but we're being closed down.
For the church.
Hang on. Join me here.
The church wanted us to cast a pentacle.
Put the scaffold up.
We had this bit lying around here for months.
Waiting for them to scratch around, getting some money..
No money..
The church is poor?
Yes, well like any other business, hey?
When they don't want what you're selling.
Selling?
Hell!
Pour the copper for us, please.
Pour the copper.
The church sent you, did it?
Who in the hell are you?
Cast metal, now
Jesus!
And we bloody thought you were the wreckers!
Good copper.
Ay, Cumbrian copper.
Smithy!
We're a foundry, aren't we?
We cast things?
I never saw a stove like that.
Now we water that spike
No, just let it cool 'til tomorrow.
No!
Before the dawn we got to raise it up by then.
To raise it?
Tonight?
You want to raise this, tonight?
Ay, our man Connor is on his way to prepare the spire.
Have a beer.
Who are you guys?
Ale.
Let's help 'em now.
It's our last night, Smithy.
Give it a bash!
There's no money in this, no one will pay.
But the copper is a tribute.
And surely people have come as we did.
With gifts.
Gifts?
From across the world.
Well, put it this way.
You probably be the first.
Please, Smithy, you must!
Anyone else comin', I wouldn't do it.
Come on, let's put water about it... and we'll put some scaffolding in the back of the wagon.
Now Martin...
...You stay with the blacksmiths.
We'll move on.
Not unless you can swim.
The cathedral is on the far side of the harbor.
That's right! We cross water!
Quicker. Quicker out of here.
Bloody horse. Come here
- Searle, it's stealing.
- Come here!
Push it Griffin, we need it.
Just go still, will you?
Just go still.
This bloody arse is just going to hold us off.
Arno, we need it to wrench up the spike.
Look, you know what happened to me last time.
It only burned, the bloody thing.
Look, you won't get off that thing until we're aboard this boat.
It seems he doesn't like the water very much.
Don't give me worms.
Bring in that bloody horse.
Bloody horse?
Doesn't matter to you if I loose the other arm, but flinging does it?
Hey! You! Bring it back.
If they take an ant for a horse.
What will they think of a horse about a boat?
Hush! Something.
We're never getting there.
We're too slow.
This boat's too slow.
Arno, take oars.
Griffin.
If there's something out there, will you tell us?
I don't like this.
I thought I told you to roar!
I row.
There's nothing out there, is this so?
What the hell is that?
You never tell us anything!
What is it?
Evil... An omen.
- You never bloody tell us!
- I didn't see it!
How could I have seen that?
It's coming against us!
Listen to us!
We're navigators from Cumbria, we've got the right of expedition!
God's faith! Forsaken!
Left me on my own!
Oh God! Saint Mary Mother of Christ, not the ocean deep!
I can't swim!
Everything we don't need, throw it over!
I can't swim!
Where's your damn church, Griffin?
I don't know!
Is it the last church of hell you're taking us to, boy?
Go in, fish.
Don't move!
Remember the queen fish dive.
Above it, the church spire.
One of us will fall.
One of us, dead!
One of us will die at the cathedral!
Who?
Who dies at cathedral?
I don't know.
No?
Not Arno.
Two hands, with hand over hand before he fell.
It's me, ain't it?
The end for me.
I've watched them all.
My wife in childbirth.
The child she died for. Picked away.
My mother. Picked away. Picked away!
And Ulf. Picked away and... Picked away!
No, Arno!
He holds our fate in his hands.
Oblivion, Griffin!
I'm last.
I die. And my blood dies.
Connor. Connor!
I hope you'll see it.
Luck's always been with Connor.
For the love of God, Griffin, tell us.
We can't move until you tell us!
Might be Martin, or you!
Could be me!
I want Connor, I want my brother back.
Oh, God.
Connor!
Connor.
What is it? What's wrong?
None of us is wearing gauntlets.
God's speed.
It's Connor! He's the one who falls!
Connor's going to fall!
Arno, talk to him.
Make sure he don't try swimming.
As soon as we reach shore, we will run like the wind, boy.
No!
It's not fast enough.
I've got to take the horse.
The horse stays with me.
There are right huge shoes, like Connor.
You stay away from these things.
They're not going anywhere.
But Searle! I've got to meet him at the church before he falls.
You'll not leave us now, will you?
Without you, we're blind.
It's Connor.
The tallest spire in christendom.
How the hell did he get up there?
When we reach shore, remember no one travels alone, Griffin...
You're our eyes, you stay with us.
Griffin!
Now what?
Griffin! Don't leave us!
You can't!
You can't do that!
Searle, come back!
Come on! Come on!
Hey, Searle!
Hurry.
Searle!
Come back here, boy!
What am I supposed to do with this boat?
If I don't catch him we're lost!
What about me? Where do I go?
I must catch him to find out!
Wait!
Griffin!
Wait for me!
The fact is, you still have an alliance with the Pentagon.
This is the real world, year 1988.
You can isolate one little pocket in the world...
and say, nuclear free,
You can try, but then... there is no real act.
No pocket, no escape from the real world.
Where is the cathedral?
I will break all the windows!
Get back, boy.
Griffin, come here.
Come here, Griffin.
The spike!
It's coming!
The cathedral, Griffin.
The refuge, make us safe.
I lost it.
I can't see the spire anymore.
Connor...
Connor is going to fall.
I don't recognize any of this.
We'll find him.
We'll find him.
I don't get a chance to catch air.
Clear the rope!
Clear!
It won't move!
The cord is stuck!
Clear it!
Be careful!
We still have some time left!
It's moving!
Get someone to ring bell, Martin.
Signal the others, the city's vast.
I am still lost, it's like...
...I see too much
Which way boy? Show us!
A signal.
Where, Griffin?
Where?
Which way, boy?
Spire on its way, up!
Searle! Searle!
Cover my eyes. Quick. Blindfold me.
Hurry! Hurry!
It's this way! Or here?
No! This way.
Wait.
Ok, take it up a little.
Just keep her right in there.
Con'! Look out!
Griffin.
What's wrong?
Don't move!
This way!
Aye! It's not safe!
Not, it's alright.
The blacksmiths give good instructions.
In Griffin's dream, it's Connor who fell.
It is going to strike it!
Beware the wind!
Hang on!
Secure it, damn it!
The horse. Tie him to it!
Make it fast!
Get back, Griffin!
Griffin, don't go!
Griffin, don't!
Griffin, watch out!
Griffin, stay back.
Con', it's not safe for you.
Safe for no one, the moon is it.
We've got to get the spike raised before the dawn be.
Leave it to me.
Can you do it?
Griffin, your hand.
Here.
God's speed.
Easy, now.
Easy...
Good, now get up there!
Easy, Griffin...
Come on, Griffin!
We'll hear the bells loud and clear at dawn... if they're still well...
The dawn's coming, for good or evil.
There's no time!
There's no time, Griffin!
Come on, boy!
You made it, boy! You made it!
The bells.
They're safe!
Do you hear that?
It was me that fell.
Connor!
Griffin!
Are you there, lads?
The bells' rang this far, you two got in.
Listen, it's Linnet.
Hello!
Con'! Linnet!
It's no one sick!
Did you hear that? Griffin, it could be we've done it!
They're well.
It's a sign.
A dream.
You had a wonderful dream, Griffin.
A wonderful story.
It was like a window opened.
So... Everyone reached the great church but me.
I got stuck at the black hay road.
You didn't get stuck, Ulf.
We don't do it.
We're long gone by then.
You went forth.
You showed the little Virgin...
...the celestial city
Hey, Ulf.
You've been travelling.
The little Virgin.
Could we place her in the great church?
Perhaps do you think it was enough to have shown her the great city?
That's enough.
I did that.
I did that watch.
It was a dream, Griffin.
Hey, but what a dream!
The vision of Hell.
Connor.
You're safe!
- Gregor.
- Searle.
It's fine to see you.
God's speed to us all.
The moon's already turned and no one's fallen down. No one!
It's great.
The village is saved!
Have we dreamed?
Could it be?
The Death!
You won't go away like that, you won't,
Connor, will you?
No, never.
Stay away from me.
Connor, no!
Death...
Connor.
Griffin!
You knew!
You were sick all along! You knew!
Griffin, I...
The Death!
How could you've come back?
Listen, I swear I didn't know. It wasn't far enough while we were in the Pit.
And then I kept my distance... from all of you. I swear it.
Then I was afraid.
There was nothing else I could do.
There was nowhere else for me to go.
And I came to believe the unfolding of your story was...
I came to believe it was my salvation.
The salvation of us all.
But the dream made you safe.
It's true, isnt' it?
It's true.
The plague's left me and ended.
The scars are all that remains.
Are we lost. Do we all die, then?
Not, it can't be!
If the infection's break loose...
Not, because I dreamed one died.
Only one.
It won't break loose!
She will not return to the village.
I want them to know the threat is gone.
The village is safe.
Con', you tell them!
You bring them around!
Make them believe my story!
They must!
You tell them once, you Con'!
They will believe it.
God's speed.
Farewell, boy.
"Not for pleasure alone"
Fanny.
Mother.
Siri.
Maj.
Grandma.
I am king of 17 lands.
Heed my command.
Alexander.
How are things?
Would you like to play cards before dinner?
THE FIRST ACT
THE EKDAHL FAMILY CELEBRATES CHRISTMAS
It takes longer every year.
Worthy Joseph, do not fear
Thy angel is thee ever near.
I come in haste to bring thee word from thy creator and thy God.
Mary and the child now wake and quickly into safety take.
Herod with his murdering hand threatens every man-child in this land.
All this I have noted well and shall do as you foretell.
Praised be God upon his throne who thus protects my only son.
Thus, good people, ends our play.
It all ends well this holy day.
The son of God, saved from the sword is our saviour,
Christ the lord.
We know that in his mercy mild he guards every woman, man and child.
Though far from Bethlehem we roam the star in the east leads us home.
Merrily may every light shed its radiance clear and bright.
A time of joyous Christmas cheer we wish to all, both far and near.
Let no one into darkness fall.
A merry Christmas one and all.
Traditionally the Ekdahls give a party for the theatre staff down on the stage.
The guests are what you'd call a rather mixed lot.
Quite different from what we're used to here in the theatre restaurant.
Nevertheless, I don't want to see any supercilious glances, snootiness, or raised eyebrows.
I want to see generosity, warmth and kindness. Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
- That's the spirit!
Alma and Petra, take the Christmas basket.
I'll take the punch bowl.
- Are we ready?
- Yes, sir.
Forward march!
Come along, Carlchen.
We mustn't be late to your mother's like last year.
Come along.
Hurry up.
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas, Oscar.
Help yourselves, everybody!
Step forward, step forward. Don't be shy.
When you've given Ismael his dinner, turn off the lights in the shop and lock up.
I have the key.
Good night, Aron.
Good night, uncle Isak.
This is the 43rd Christmas we're celebrating together.
My dear ester, is it possible?
Yes, the 43rd.
Well, well, who'd have thought it?
Yes, it's odd.
Dear ester.
Good evening, Mrs. Ekdahl.
Good evening, girls.
- Alida, you may join the other girls.
- Thank you, Mrs. Ekdahl.
- Why are you so sullen?
- I'm not sullen.
I can see you are.
You're always sullen on Christmas eve.
- I don't know what you mean.
- You heard me. You're sullen.
Old hag.
My dear friends.
For 22 years... in the capacity of theatre manager,
I've stood here and made a speech... without really having any talent... for that sort of thing.
Especially if you think of my father, who was brilliant at speeches.
My only talent, if you can call it that in my case... is that I love this little world... inside the thick walls of this playhouse.
And I'm fond of the people who work in this little world.
Outside is the big world, and sometimes the little world succeeds... in reflecting the big one... so that we understand it better.
Or perhaps we give the people who come here a chance to forget for a while... for a few short moments... for a few short moments... the harsh world outside.
Our theatre is... a little room... of orderliness, routine, care... and love.
I don't know why I feel... so comically solemn... this evening.
I can't explain how I feel, so I'd best be brief.
My wife and I... and the rest of the Ekdahl family, my brother Carl
- I think Carl is here.
We wish you all a happy and joyous Christmas.
I hope we meet again on St. Stephen's day, strengthened in body and soul.
Merry Christmas.
Isak!
Merry Christmas.
I can't think where they all are.
They should have been here a long time ago.
I expect Oscar is making a long, dull speech.
I think I hear them down in the street.
Ester, bring me my fur.
There comes my family.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, grandma.
Merry Christmas, aunt.
Mama, you look so beautiful.
What is it, darling?
Aunt Emma, how nice to see you.
Aunt Emma, how nice. Welcome.
What time is it?
The only question is:
Where are Carl and Lydia?
Perhaps they got the wrong time.
Christmas dinner is always at 4:30.
Alexander, run down and ring uncle Carl's doorbell.
- Carlchen, please hurry.
- Shut up!
- We're so late.
- Shut up!
We arrive late every year.
- I'm doing this for your sake.
- No more, mein Carlchen.
- Mama.
- Well, Carl.
Merry Christmas, aunt.
Well, at last we can have dinner.
Now for the first sing hop faderallan lallan lay and those who don't the first one take will also number two forsake now for the first sing hop faderallan lallan lay cheers, Isak and miss Alida.
I've got terrible heartburn.
I have to take a pill.
Mr. Jacobi, how awful!
The Ekdahls will be the death of me.
After last Christmas,
I was in bed for three weeks with kidney pains.
- You don't say.
- Worse than childbirth.
Does miss Alida have children?
Good heavens, no.
Why do you ask?
I'm in need of a housekeeper, miss Alida.
Thank you, sir, but I like it with the Ekdahl family.
Let's discuss it after the new year.
Well, there's no harm in discussing it.
So you see, my brother Gustav Adolf Ekdahl is a magnificent human being.
Then you brown the breasts, but use plenty of butter in the pan, and fry some prime pork at the same time.
Then you put the ground meat on top of the breast, and the pork on top of that.
Finally, you pour the port sauce with mushrooms on top of everything.
Hey, Christmas gnomes let's raise our glasses and be merry our time on earth is brief full of toil and grief hey, Christmas gnomes let's raise our glasses and be merry no appetite, miss ester?
Miss Vega, you're not eating anything yourself.
It's not easy, I must say.
No, it's not easy.
You're right.
It's unseemly, all of us sitting together like this.
I agree with you.
It's unseemly.
Sitting together in the kitchen.
It was the old master who decided --
Be that as it may.
It's awkward nonetheless.
Yes, it is. It's awkward.
Well, Fanny, we're having a pleasant time, aren't we?
I think dinner is taking too long.
You're wondering what you'll get for Christmas, of course.
Aren't you, uncle Gusten?
You're absolutely right, my dear.
I'm quite curious as to what the evening will bring.
Frau von Bahlen.
My dear husband has implored me to sing something after dinner.
I said I couldn't, but he's so persistent.
He says my singing reminds him of our youthful days in Munich.
My husband is so touching,
Frau von Bahlen.
Sometimes he's like a child.
Your father is a magnificent human being.
You think I'm being sarcastic.
I'm never sarcastic when I'm in good spirits.
So believe me, Petra, when I say... then you add carrots, sprouts, red cabbage and cauliflower, and then you pour cognac over the whole thing.
We'll have to try it on twelfth night
- if we're still alive, of course.
Dear friends,
I would like to make a speech.
But I'm not going to.
Cheers, Carl.
Short and sweet!
This is the 24th Christmas I've celebrated with the family.
My dear Emma, is it really possible?
Yes, my Karl-Henrik died in '79.
Was it that long ago?
He'd be 98 years old if he were living today.
My dear Emma, imagine that.
I was 19 when we got married.
You were only 19?
A great age difference.
There's no denying that.
But you were fond of --
My sister also married an older man.
Yes, I remember.
It was a magnificent wedding.
He died three months later, leaving a fortune behind.
Karl-Henrik did no such thing.
No, he certainly didn't.
Putte!
Try sitting up properly for once.
Elbows down and back straight.
You really have awful table manners.
Berta, since you're sitting next to my father, could you ask him for me if I may be spared being taught manners on Christmas eve?
- Siri.
- What is it, Jenny?
Are you mad about something?
Not at all.
Why do you ask?
You're not laughing like everybody else.
Some people find it hard to laugh.
Why?
Some people bear a great sorrow, for instance.
And it grows larger and larger when others are happy?
For some people,
Christmas is a bit difficult.
Why?
Well, Jenny, there are so many memories.
Maybe you'll be happy by next Christmas.
Maybe.
Aunt Anna?
Yes, Alexander?
Since you're so rich, you could get any man you please.
- You think so, Alexander?
- That's what father says, anyway.
That's nice to hear.
So, you're leaving us to get married, miss Berta.
Yes, sir, I am.
Well, it's going to be damned lonely without you.
Both my wife and I --
It looks like you'll have some consolation.
Here's to old times, miss Berta.
Cheers, sir... and good luck.
A rhyme for the porridge.
"Our porridge is our strength and stay it is our staple food in joy, in grief, both night and day it always does us good" look! I found the almond!
Four cheers for the coming year's little bride-to-be!
Now it's Yule again, now it's Yule again and Yule will last until it's Easter that's not true of course no, that's not true of course for in between comes lent and fasting what would Maj say to a little visit in her room this evening?
The master must be joking.
Are you all right, sir?
I'm fine.
I must help the girls with the tree.
Have you noticed that my old man has begun to court Maj?
- Aren't you angry?
- Angry?
I think it's sweet.
Children, come.
Uncle Carl is going to treat you to one helluva fireworks show.
Stay here.
Ready?
Number one.
Now comes number two.
Now comes number three.
Bring the candle.
"And it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.
And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.
And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.
And Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea... unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem... because he was of the house and lineage of David, to be taxed with Mary his wife, who was great with child.
And so it was that while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.
And she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn."
- Give up?
- No!
I'm sorry.
It's a terrible mess in here.
Come see us later and you'll get a Christmas present.
Thank you, Mrs. Ekdahl.
Now then, children, into bed.
Hurry up, Alexander.
To bed now, children.
Now say your prayers.
Thank you God for this day.
Please make me good.
May your angel stay by me through the night.
God bless papa and mama, grandpapa and grandmama, myself and my brothers and sisters and cousins, uncles and aunts,
Vega, Ester, Maj, Siri, Berta, Alida,
Lisen and uncle Isak and everybody else.
Amen.
- Good night, Alexander.
- Good night, sweetheart.
Good night. Sleep well.
Putte kisses like a real man.
Look at my Christmas present.
Look what Mrs. Ekdahl gave me.
Aren't I beautiful?
Don't I look lovely?
I look like a real lady.
Don't you think?
Tonight you can't sleep in Maj's bed because Maj will have a visitor.
And I can't just have any number of men in my bed.
But you're Maj's sweetheart.
You know that.
I think mama should recite something.
No, my dear.
Calm down, now.
Don't be shy.
You give wonderful recitations.
No, I don't know.
I'll have to fortify myself.
I don't know what to read.
Well, you asked for it.
Alone I advance on my course farther and farther stretches the road alas, in the distance my goal is hidden dusk is falling, night fills the sky soon the everlasting stars are all I see but I do not lament the fleeting day the coming night does not appal me for of the love that shines through the world a gleam has entered my soul how beautiful.
Well, my dear ones, it's time to say good night.
We're getting up early.
Carlchen! Wake up.
We're going home.
Good night, mama. Carl's a bit tired.
I'll give him a hand.
Come along now.
We're going home.
Good night.
Good night, mama.
- I stayed behind.
- So I noticed.
There she lies, the beautiful girl, poor Arabella.
Little does she know what awaits her.
She's alone in the whole house.
Her mother is dead, and her father is carousing with loose companions.
Who comes there as the clock strikes 12:00 in the castle tower?
"Fear seizes me.
What is that terrifying white figure floating on the moonbeams and drawing near my bed?
It is my dead mother.
My mother's ghost."
No more noise in here now!
Go to sleep, children.
Good night.
I thought I smelled kerosene in the nursery.
- Kerosene?
- Yes, kerosene.
There's no kerosene lamp in the nursery.
Well, it smells like it anyway.
I'll go see what it could be.
It really does smell of kerosene.
Are you sleeping, you brats?
What have you been up to?
That's strange.
Yes, very strange.
This is a chair.
But not just any chair.
It might look like an ordinary nursery chair, made of wood, humble and rather worn... but looks can be deceiving.
It's actually the most valuable chair in the world.
It belonged to the emperor of china and has by strange paths ended up in the Ekdahl nursery.
But pay attention, ladies and gentlemen.
Look closely.
Keep your eyes open.
Look there.
Do you see the mysterious light that radiates from that little chair?
That's right.
It glows from within.
Look how it shines.
Now I ask you, my children:
Why does the chair shine?
Why does it shimmer in the dark?
I'll tell you, but remember:
It's a secret.
Whoever reveals it will perish.
Do you swear to keep quiet?
- We swear.
Not so loud.
Mother could hear us.
And that would be the end of the performance.
This is the most valuable chair in the world.
It's made of a metal found
40 miles beneath the earth, and only in china.
Though it appears encrusted with diamonds, it's much finer and more costly.
The chair was built 3,000 years ago by the emperor's master jeweller as a birthday present for the empress.
She was very small in stature, not much bigger than Fanny, but she was the world's most beautiful woman.
Her entire life she sat on this chair.
Two servants accompanied her wherever she went, carrying the chair between them.
When the empress died, she was buried sitting on this chair.
For 2,000 years she sat in her burial chamber.
The chair shimmered in the dark, its light shining right through the empress's little figure.
But then a band of robbers came and broke into the tomb.
They knocked the empress off the chair, and she turned to powder and dust.
Then they made off with the chair.
Now it belongs to you.
The most precious chair in the world belongs to you.
Take care of it, for it's very fragile.
It might easily fall to pieces.
Touch it gently.
Sit on it very carefully.
Talk to it.
And at least twice a day breathe on it.
What an idiotic little chair!
So worn and ridiculous!
And ugly, to boot!
I'll be damned!
I think the confounded chair is trying to bite my rear end!
I'll show it!
Don't do that!
Have you all gone mad?
It's 3:00 in the morning!
We have to get up for church in two hours!
- Can we be in Hamlet?
- Please.
I know you've spoken with Mr. Landahl, but this is a matter for father to decide.
It's for mother to decide.
It's much too late for children who have school the next day.
No, it's not.
We can be pages in the first act.
Who's not in the last act can't be in the first.
It has to be different pages in the last act anyway.
Good night, kids.
On the condition that you do your homework... and come straight home after the court scenes.
And absolutely no whining about getting up the next morning.
Here we go, Isak.
I've made some nice strong coffee.
Much better than Vega's awful dishwater.
Give this a try.
What can the time be?
Ten past 3:00.
We can sit for two hours, and then I must change for early service.
How good it is to have you here!
You're my best friend.
Whatever would I do without you?
Last year I enjoyed Christmas.
This year all I wanted to do was cry.
I suppose I'm getting old.
Do you think I've aged?
You've grown older, yes.
I thought so.
Yes, I just wanted to cry.
Though I love having the grandchildren, of course.
I didn't think Oscar looked well.
He wears himself out with that theatre.
And the idea of him playing the ghost.
He should take it easy.
Besides, he's an awfully bad actor.
I wonder if Emilie realizes that he's weak and needs rest.
I think I'll have a word with her.
He's capable, of course.
Capable and conscientious.
Can you believe the theatre even makes a small profit?
Isn't that splendid?
A few years ago I contributed a minimum of 50,000 kronor per year.
I didn't care, but Oscar felt so awkward asking me for money.
Not like Carl.
He asked me for a new loan, but I refused.
If he comes to you for money, you must say no too.
Promise me that.
- Yes, yes.
I don't understand it.
Time and again I clear everything up for him.
After a year, he's in dire straits again.
He says he doesn't go to moneylenders.
- Do you know?
- No.
And that poor German woman he's married to.
How could he have fallen for her?
It must be something erotic.
What do you think?
Erotic? Yes, perhaps.
- You're not listening.
- Yes, I am.
Never mind.
The main thing is that you keep me company.
Carl and Gustav Adolf are oversexed.
They take after their father.
He was oversexed.
At times I thought it was too much of a good thing, but I never refused.
Gustav Adolf is incorrigible.
I've spoken with Alma, and she wisely says she doesn't mind his philandering, because he's the kindest husband in the world.
It's fortunate that alma is so understanding.
Perhaps I ought to warn that nursemaid Maj, or whatever her name is.
I must say she's very pretty, and good with the children.
Beautiful colouring and a nice figure.
Pity she limps, the poor thing.
What you don't poke your nose into you don't have to pull it out of, as grandma used to say.
- Are you asleep?
- No, no.
Carl and Gustav Adolf got too much, and Oscar got nothing.
Imagine the tragedy for Emilie, who's such a warm-blooded young woman.
When she was pregnant with Fanny, she told me all about it.
Poor girl.
I have to say she's handled her affairs in a most tactful manner.
Oscar and Emilie are enormously fond of each other.
A happy marriage in spite of everything.
Are you sad because you've grown old?
I'm certainly not.
Everything's getting worse.
Worse people, worse machines, worse wars... and worse weather.
I'm glad I'll soon be dead.
You're an incorrigible old misanthrope and always have been.
- I don't agree with you.
- I thought as much.
That doesn't stop me from crying.
Would you mind if I cry a while?
No, upon my soul, I can't.
The tears won't come.
I'll have to have some more cognac.
What are you laughing at?
Do you remember when we sat there on the sofa kissing madly?
You had unbuttoned my blouse, and something else too.
Then suddenly the curtain was drawn aside, and there stood my dear husband.
It was just like a play by Feydeau.
I screamed and you made for the door.
He rushed off to get his pistol, with me hanging on his leg.
You became friends for life.
Your husband was a great-hearted man.
Now I'm weeping.
The happy, splendid life is over, and the horrible, dirty life engulfs us.
That's the way it is.
This won't do.
I must wash up and redo my makeup, do my hair and put on my corset and silk dress.
A weepy, lovesick woman turns into a self-possessed grandmother.
We all play our parts.
Some play them negligently, others with great care.
I'm one of the latter.
Good night, my lovely Helena.
You were a sweet lover.
Like strawberries.
You wanted me to help you with your morning toilet, Mrs. Ekdahl.
The time is ten to 5:00.
A cafe on castle street.
Your own cakes and pastries, tarts and confections.
What do you say to that, little Maj?
You'd be in charge of it.
Just yesterday I said to alma,
"look at Maj.
She's a princess."
What breasts you have, my girl.
Let me see properly.
You drive me crazy.
Don't be afraid, child.
I'm a wonderful lover.
All the women say so.
Once you get me on my back, you'll forget about the cafe.
I swear.
Give me something to write on.
Come. Come over here.
Here's a pen.
Now I'll write:
"Maja kling... is the proprietress of my cafe."
Signed, Gustav Adolf Ekdahl.
Christmas night, 1907.
There! That's a contract.
Stick it under a lawyer's nose if I forget my promise.
Be careful not to put me in the family way.
Well, what do you say?
Aren't I nice?
Ever felt such a wooden leg?
Damnation!
The rocket went off too soon.
Oh, well, it happens.
Wasn't it wonderful?
You're a real Billy goat, sir.
And you're my little lamb.
I must lie on my back.
I'm all in a sweat.
- I ate and drank too much.
- You're not ill?
Not me!
I feel like a bakery ablaze.
Or should I say cafe?
Iii?
When I'm with such a tasty little morsel?
Sit on top of me.
Oh, you're impossible, sir!
Ride a rocking horse to Banbury cross to see a fine lady on a white steed what a glorious time we're having!
- My goodness, how your heart's pounding.
- I've got a splendid heart.
Now you'll have to give me a new bed.
You'll have a cafe, an apartment, beautiful furniture, and a big bed.
- And pretty clothes.
- No one will be prettier.
You will be Gustav Adolf's mistress, and I'll come see you every
Wednesday and Saturday at 3:00.
How silly you are.
- What?
- I said you're silly.
- Silly, am I?
- You're a real numbskull.
I'm not a numbskull!
You are, for imagining I'd want anything from you.
Don't you want anything?
Don't you see I was joking?
Joking?
In what way?
Don't be angry.
I'm not, but I don't like being treated like an idiot.
- Stop laughing.
- I think you're so funny.
I don't like being laughed at.
I can feel a cold coming on.
My throat hurts when I swallow.
My teeth are tingling.
It's freezing in here.
Why isn't there any heat?
We don't have any credit with the wood merchant.
We owe 150 kronor.
Das wei┈t du doch.
You haven't learned a damn bit of Swedish in 23 years.
Speak Swedish!
I do my best.
Last Tuesday I asked mama for ten thousand to sort out my affairs.
She took out a paper that said I owed her 37,000.
It's incredible.
- You'll have to go to the Jew.
- I've already been.
I'm paying one hell of an exorbitant interest rate, and if I don't pay on time, he'll show the iou to mama.
I have some jewellery.
Idiot.
That would be nice.
Professor Ekdahl running to the pawnbroker.
Aren't you coming to bed?
I feel ill.
There was something wrong with the herring salad.
It tasted stale.
I'm sure mama saved it from Easter, the stingy hag.
You don't serve herring salad for Christmas, damn it.
Why did I marry you?
You're ugly, poor and barren.
You couldn't even give me a child.
You never make love to me.
- Ich sage aber nichts.
- Speak Swedish.
Poor Carl.
You're so unhappy.
If you weren't so anxious --
The dean scolded me.
Said I'm neglecting my lectures.
I'm a scientist, the only real scientist in the whole damn university.
But nobody cares.
Oh, my head.
I have a terrible headache.
And we have to go to that damn early service!
Coercion at every turn!
No, Carlchen!
Then you have to smile matter-of-factly,
"dear mama, how beautiful you are.
You look like a young woman."
"Dear Emilie, I've never seen you play the Christmas angel so wonderfully."
"How is it, Oscar, that you succeed in everything you do?"
How do you do that?
Come, Carlchen.
Come and sit by me.
You smell bad.
Have you given up washing, or are you starting to rot?
No.
I don't smell bad at all.
You have olfactory hallucinations.
It's bleeding.
- Shall I bandage it up?
- No.
- Won't you try and get some sleep?
- Yes.
I feel sorry for you, mein Carlchen.
How is it one becomes second-rate?
Can you tell me that?
How does the dust fall?
When has one lost?
First I'm a prince, heir to the kingdom.
Suddenly, before I know it...
I'm deposed.
Death taps me on the shoulder.
The room is cold... and we can't pay for kindling.
I'm stupid and unkind.
And I'm most unkind... to the only person who cares for me.
You can never forgive me.
I'm a shit and a cad.
If you'd like,
I'll make you a hot toddy.
Don't be so damned servile!
Wipe your mouth.
Your lips are always wet. It's disgusting!
I don't mean to be unkind.
I know that, mein liebling.
Oh, life!
Insomnia, poverty and humiliation.
Stretch out your hand and you grope in the emptiness.
Why am I such a bloody coward?
You have your amusements.
- That's enough, mein liebling.
- Nothing troubles you.
I strike you and you kiss my hand.
I spit on you and you forgive me.
You're repulsive!
I can't stand your love.
I have to get away from you.
You'll have to go back to Munich.
We're getting a divorce.
I want to finally be spared seeing you, smelling you, listening to your damned gibberish.
I'll be spared your solicitude, your anxious eyes, your cloying love.
When you're sad and unhappy, you always talk like this.
I don't care anymore.
You know that.
I want to sleep.
Maybe I'll dream of a sweet-smelling female body... with small breasts and narrow hips, long legs... dark hair and cheerful personality.
Her legs and arms are wrapped around me, pressing herself against me.
We make love.
Her flesh is firm and generous.
Damnation!
Old age, prison, disgust!
No, Carlchen!
Stop! Stop it!
Don't touch me, damn it!
You know why I hate you so, mein liebchen?
You're a mirror image.
Kindness reflects kindness.
Mediocrity reflects mediocrity.
I see it contorting your face.
You suffer, but you endure it.
That's the big difference,
I will never endure it.
Good night.
Well, Gustav Adolf.
- Good morning, papa.
- Good morning, Petra.
Don't I get a kiss?
- Good morning, Gustav Adolf.
- Good morning, alma.
Go and fry three eggs and some ham for papa, and make two cheese sandwiches.
- What will you drink?
- Beer.
Petra, you know where the beer crate is.
No, wait,
I think there's some stout in the cupboard.
- Would you rather have stout?
- Yes.
Don't stand there staring.
We have to be at grandma's in an hour.
- How do you feel?
- Cognac.
- I've put out your clothes.
- Thank you.
And there's hot water if you want a bath.
That would be nice.
Hurry up now.
You're a damned handsome woman.
And you're a big shit.
- Come to bed.
- I just did my hair.
We'll have a quick one standing up.
- Petra's coming with breakfast.
- We'll lock the door.
Come on then, but make it quick.
- I don't think I can.
- You can't?
No.
There must be something wrong.
- You're not sick, are you?
- I'm fit as a fiddle.
- Lie down on the bed.
- Yes, I guess I could do that.
- Shall I bring in the breakfast tray?
- Yes, please.
To think that I haven't killed you.
Now what do you say?
I wonder if it will be a cold day.
I think it'll be very cold.
My thermometer says 4* below.
Don't yawn at the table, Alexander.
Cheers, brother Carl.
I heard the Bishop will be saying the service today.
Really?
I can't help it.
Your father's a bit nutty.
Excuse me.
Well, my friends, it's time.
THE SECOND ACT
THE GHOST REHEARSAL
My hour is almost come when I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames must render up myself.
Alas, poor ghost.
Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing to what I shall unfold.
Speak.
I am bound to hear.
So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear --
What?
I am thy father's spirit.
Doomed for a certain term to walk the night, and for the day confined to fast in fires till the foul crimes done in my days of nature are burnt and purged away.
But that I am forbid to tell the secrets of my prison house
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood, make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres.
But this eternal blazon must not be to ears of flesh and blood.
List, o list!
If thou didst ever thy dear father love... o God!
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
Murder!
Yes, murder!
Murder most foul, as in the best it is.
But this most foul... strange --
- ...and unnatural.
- Huh?
And unnatural.
Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift as meditation or the thoughts of love, may sweep to my revenge.
Now, Hamlet, hear.
'Tis given out, that sleeping in my orchard, a serpent stung me.
So the whole ear of Denmark is by a forged process of my death rankly abused.
But know, thou noble youth - the serpent that did sting thy father's life.
Huh? Did sting?
Thy father's life.
Did sting thy father's life now wears his crown o my prophetic soul!
My uncle?
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast, with witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts - o wicked wit and gifts, that have the power so to seduce - won to his shameful lust the will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
But soft!
Methinks I scent the morning air.
Mr. Landahl, shouldn't there be steps here?
Can somebody help Mr. Ekdahl down.
The steps were forgotten today.
Brief let me be.
Sleeping within my orchard my custom always of the afternoon upon my secure hour thy uncle stole with juice of cursed hebenon in a vial and in the porches of my ears did pour the leperous distilment, whose effect holds such an enmity with blood of man that swift as quicksilver it courses through the natural gates and alleys of the body and with a sudden vigour it doth possess and curd, like eager droppings into milk, the thin and wholesome blood:
So did it mine and a most instant tetter bark'd about most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust all my smooth body.
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand... of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatched.
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin, unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd, no reckoning made but sent to my account with all my imperfections on my head.
Oh, horrible, most horrible!
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be a couch for luxury and damned incest.
I've forgotten what I am to do.
You get up and exit upstage centre.
- Where am I?
- Here... at the theatre.
Let's go home and rest.
What's happened?
You're tired, that's all.
Shall I call for the ambulance?
What am I doing here?
You were acting.
I was acting?
Why was I acting?
Come along, Oscar.
Let's go home.
Am I going to die now?
Please help me.
I'll get a carriage.
He needs his overcoat.
Alexander, come along.
Come on.
Stop!
I said stop! Hey, you!
Take the cart behind you!
Come along, Alexander.
No.
No.
We know nothing yet.
Yes, let's hope so.
Thank you for calling.
- How is our dear Oscar?
- We can only hope.
- How is he?
- It's a matter of hours.
- Is he in pain?
- He sleeps most of the time.
Go see ester and Vega for hot chocolate and sandwiches.
I was over at the Gustavssons' and I met Mr. Albrektsson.
Just imagine, children.
This letter will go all the way to a mission in china.
Mr. Albrektsson told me his poodle had four puppies.
A friend of mine has lived there for 50 years.
He wondered if you'd like a puppy.
Mama won't let us have dogs or cats.
- We could keep it here.
- Really?
- Yes.
- Splendid.
Otherwise it'll be sold.
When I was in china, working in the fields with my friend, we had a dog and three cats.
- Want to play again?
- You take red, then.
Mr. Albrektsson makes lots of money on his dogs, but he wants to give this puppy away.
He's wealthy in his own right.
It's his wife's money, dear ester.
Would you two like a molasses sandwich?
Yes, please, miss Vega.
There, the letter's finished.
Come, Fanny, and I'll let you lick the envelope.
- Would you like to borrow the flute?
- No, thank you.
- You want to lick the stamp?
- No, thank you.
You lick the stamp, then.
Thank you, sweetheart.
Leave me alone.
Come in.
Your mama asked me to come get you.
Let's put down the sandwiches.
Hurry up, Alexander.
Come, Alexander.
Don't be afraid.
Come here, Alexander.
Come on.
I'll wait outside.
Come here, Fanny.
Tell Alexander there's nothing to be afraid of.
I'll tell him.
You needn't be afraid.
This is nothing to worry about.
I feel no pain.
I actually feel better than I have in a long time.
Don't be alarmed if I keep my eyes closed.
The light seems rather bright.
It doesn't matter if I close my eyes.
I could play the ghost now... really well.
Nothing.
Nothing... separates me from all of you.
Not now... and not later.
I know that.
I see it... quite clearly.
I'll be closer to you now... than when I lived.
Now I'd like to look at Alexander.
Father says there's nothing to be afraid of.
Don't be childish now.
Try to be a good boy.
Take care of the theatre.
Mr. Sandblad will explain the business side.
Artistic matters you'll decide on your own... as usual.
A simple funeral.
Don't forget.
Nothing Majestic in the cathedral... with Chopin's "funeral march."
Promise me that.
Everything must go on as usual.
Everything must go on as usual.
I'll soon be dead.
Will you hold my hand?
Eternity, Emilie.
Eternity.
Fanny, wake up.
You hear that?
My condolences.
Allow me to assure you that my family and I feel the very greatest sympathy in this difficult hour that has befallen you and your esteemed family.
It is our regiment's duty and honour, in keeping with our proud tradition, to be allowed to express our sympathy at the funeral service.
Allow me to kiss your hand in veneration and affection... and venture so boldly as to offer all the support an imperfect mortal can.
Alexander, come out.
The Bishop will be here any moment.
I don't give a damn!
Come out now.
Don't be stupid.
My deepest sympathy.
My dear Emilie Ekdahl... words are so inadequate.
Let's gather together.
Right foot.
It is with dismay that we gather around Oscar's bier.
A close friend has been taken, and we're left in distress.
We actors, who daily play with life and death, should not be so upset, but oddly enough, our dismay is greater --
...greater than others'.
The hour before he died, he was conscious.
He even laughed.
We spoke of practical things... the children's future and business matters.
We also spoke of our theatre.
Oscar said,
"everything must go on as usual, Emilie."
So we'll carry on as usual.
At Oscar's request,
I'll take over management of the theatre.
We resume rehearsals tomorrow.
The premiere of Hamlet will proceed as announced.
That's everything.
We'll all do our best.
Thank you.
Dear Emilie.
Oscar will be proud.
I'm so happy for your sake, dear Emilie.
Cock, piss, shit, fart, piss, hell, shit, cock, fart, shit, piss, fart, cock, cunt, damn, hell, crap, ass, piss, cock, butt, pussy.
Siri, tell the children they may leave the table.
Yes, ma'am.
Did you hear something?
Alexander, wake up!
There's something out there.
THE THIRD ACT
BREAK-UP
When that I was and a little tiny boy with a hey, ho, the wind and the rain.
A foolish thing was but a toy for the rain it raineth every day.
Did you hear Emilie wants to talk to us after the performance?
Doesn't sound good.
No.
But when I came to man's estate with hey, ho, the wind and the rain
'gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate.
For the rain it raineth every day.
But when I came, alas, to wive with hey, ho, the wind and the rain.
By swaggering could I never thrive.
For the rain it raineth every day.
Emilie, you want to speak with us afterwards?
What is it about?
But when I came unto my beds with hey, ho, the wind and the rain.
With tosspots still had drunken heads.
For the rain it raineth every day.
A great while ago the world begun with hey, ho, the wind and the rain.
But that's all one, our play is done and we'll strive to please you every day.
Well, that's that.
Better hurry up, you old ghost.
It's all a bunch of crap.
If you'd please sit down,
I'd like to talk to you.
My husband died a year ago today.
He wanted us to go on as usual, and we have gone on as usual, though everything has been different.
We draw the theatre over our heads like a security blanket.
Our dressing rooms are bright and warm.
The stage enfolds us in friendly shadows.
Playwrights tell us what to say and think.
We laugh, cry and rage.
People sit there in the dark, kindly disposed towards us.
They're remarkably loyal, though we often give them stones instead of bread.
Most of the time we're simply playing.
Almost always.
We play because we enjoy it.
And if we don't enjoy it, we sulk and blame the circumstances... never ourselves.
That's how it is.
So I pass my life in wonderful self-deception, with a keen eye for others' faults while glossing over my own.
I don't know what I really am, as I never cared to find out the truth about myself.
But I do care about myself, which is something different.
And I don't care about reality, either.
It's drab and uninteresting.
It doesn't concern me, unless, in one way or another, it concerns the part I'm playing.
Are you tired of the theatre?
I think so.
- You want to quit?
- Perhaps, and for good.
What will happen to us if you quit?
Even if I quit, everything will go on as before.
Who will be our manager?
We'll all decide that together when the day comes, if it comes.
I haven't yet made up my mind.
Now I suggest we say good night.
Good night.
Come children.
Let's change.
I need a drink and a sandwich.
Anyone care to join me?
I've received an offer from the Lindberg troupe, so it's all the same to me.
What did I tell you?
I think there's something behind this.
- Haven't you heard?
- You mean it's true?
Well, I'll be damned.
If music be the food of love, play on.
Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting --
Come, Alexander.
Stop fooling around.
Come on.
Good day, Alexander.
Please give my regards to your mother.
- You're gonna be sorry.
- What do you mean?
You'll soon find out.
Hi.
What's wrong?
Someone wishes to talk to you.
The hot chocolate will have to wait.
- What have I done?
- You know quite well.
- Good day, Alexander.
- Good day.
We met once before.
Under sadder circumstances, when I officiated at your father's funeral.
Since then, your mother has turned to me with her worries, as is only natural.
I am a close friend of your grandmother.
I'm the spiritual guide of the parish.
The Bishop has been very good to me during this difficult time.
We've also spoken of you, my son.
I've told the Bishop how proud I am of my well-behaved children.
You and your sister are doing well at school,
I'm told.
Diligent and attentive, and earning good grades.
Isn't that so, Alexander?
Don't be afraid.
I'm your friend and wish you well.
You believe me, don't you?
But diligence and good grades are not everything in this world.
Blow your nose, Alexander.
That's filthy!
Didn't Maj give you a clean handkerchief?
Yes.
Goddamn it all!
As I said, diligence and good grades aren't everything in this world.
Listen to the Bishop, Alexander.
I'm sure he is.
Isn't that so, Alexander?
You're anxious to know what I'm going to say.
You're a big boy now.
So I'll talk to you man to man.
Can you tell me --
Can you explain to me what a lie is and what the truth is?
You think that was a stupid question, and it probably was.
I was just kidding with you.
Of course you know what a lie is and what the truth is, don't you?
Splendid.
Splendid, my boy.
You also know why one lies.
Why does one lie?
Why does one lie?
Can you explain to me why one lies?
Because you don't want to tell the truth.
A very sly answer, my young friend.
But you won't get off so easily.
I asked you... why does one not tell the truth?
I don't know.
We have plenty of time, Alexander, and I'm so interested in your answer that I'm prepared to wait indefinitely.
You may not believe that, but it's true.
One lies to gain an advantage.
Good answer, my boy.
Good and concise.
Forgive me if I ask another question, a bit more personal this time.
Can you explain to your mother and me why you lied at school?
What?
Your teacher has written to me, saying that you've been spreading the most incredible lies.
Like what?
Sold to a circus!
Do you deny that you told your classmates that I sold you to a travelling circus, and that at the end of the semester they're coming to get you?
You are to train as an acrobat and circus rider, together with a gypsy your age named Tamara.
Your mother was both terrified and upset when she read the letter.
She didn't know what to do.
So I suggested I come over and discuss these unpleasant problems with you.
And here I am.
You should be grateful to the
Bishop for taking the time.
Do you understand, Alexander?
We've agreed that he who lies does so to gain an advantage.
So I ask, quite logically, what advantage did you gain by stating your mother had sold you to a circus?
I don't know.
I think you do know... but you're ashamed to answer.
You're ashamed, aren't you?
That's good, my son. Very good.
It shows you'll be on your guard against further fabrications in the future.
Go to your mother and ask her forgiveness for all the sorrow and worry you've caused her.
Go to your mother and ask her to forgive you.
You hear what I say, don't you?
I ask mother's forgiveness for lying, and I promise never to do it again.
Good, Alexander.
The matter is resolved and need never be mentioned again.
Imagination is a splendid thing, a mighty force, a gift from God.
It's held in trust for us by the great artists, writers and musicians.
I'll get Fanny.
Come, Alexander.
I have something important to tell you.
Edvard has asked if I will marry him.
I've accepted with gratitude and joy.
I've been alone for a long time, and my children need a firm hand.
A father.
Of course, a great deal will be --
May God in his mercy take care of our little family.
Let us kneel down and unite in a heartfelt prayer.
May God our father in his mercy take care of our little family and bless us and keep us from evil all the days of our life.
God give me strength to be a guardian and a worthy example to these little fatherless ones.
Give me strength as well to be a support to this lonely young woman.
In the 15th century, when this house was built, they didn't bother much about comfort.
My predecessors kept it all as it was, and I follow the tradition.
These old rooms have an imperishable beauty.
We should be grateful that we may live in an atmosphere of purity and austerity.
Ah, here come my mother and sister.
You're already here.
Welcome, Mrs. Ekdahl.
Thank you.
This is my sister Henrietta.
- Welcome to the Bishop's palace.
- Thank you.
Come and say hello, children.
This is Mrs. Tander, our capable cook, who's been with our family for 30 years.
This is my future wife, Mrs.
Emilie Ekdahl.
Good day, Mrs.
Ekdahl. Welcome.
These are our capable helpers: Karna,
Selma and little Justina.
Now we'll go see my aunt, who, alas, is sick and bedridden.
How are you today, aunt Elsa?
We have a visitor.
Don't be afraid, children.
Come and say hello.
My future wife, Mrs.
Emilie Ekdahl, the famous actress.
Hello, miss Bergius.
The children have fallen asleep.
It's late and we must go home.
- Not yet.
- What is it, Edvard?
I have a wish.
A single wish, but an important one.
You may change your mind if you find it impossible.
Tell me your wish.
I want you to come to my house without possessions.
What do you mean?
I want you to leave your home... your clothes, jewels, furniture... your valuables... your friends, habits and thoughts.
I want you to leave your former life entirely.
Am I to come naked?
I'm serious, my dear.
I want you to come to your new life as if newly born.
- And the children?
- The children also.
- Their toys, dolls, books...
- Nothing.
- I must talk to them.
- It's your decision.
I can decide for myself, but not for the children.
I must ask them.
They must sacrifice something for their mother's happiness.
You're angry.
Kiss me.
I'm not angry, not in the least.
I'll win them over.
Think it over, Emilie.
I've already thought it over.
For me it's not hard to grant your wish.
I've never cared for anything very seriously.
I've sometimes wondered if there wasn't something very wrong with my feelings.
I couldn't understand why nothing really hurt... why I never felt really happy.
I know now that the crucial moment has come.
I know that we'll hurt each other, but I'm not afraid.
I also know that we will make each other happy.
And I sometimes weep from fear, because time is so short, the days pass so quickly, and nothing lasts forever.
You say your God is the God of love.
It sounds so beautiful... and I wish I could believe as you do.
Perhaps one day I will.
My God is so different, Edvard.
He's like myself, amorphous and intangible.
I'm an actress.
I'm used to wearing masks.
My God wears a thousand masks.
He's never shown me his real face, just as I can't show you or him my real face.
Through you I'll come to know God's true nature.
Kiss me, now, and hold me in your arms, as only you can.
I, Olof Henrik Edvard Vergerus... take thee,
Elisabet Emilie Josefin Ekdahl... to be my wedded wife... to love you for better and for worse... and as a symbol of this love I give you this ring.
I, Elisabet Emilie Josefin Ekdahl... take thee,
Olof Henrik Edvard Vergerus, to be my wedded husband... to love you for better and for worse... and as a symbol of this love I take this ring.
In the name of God the father, son and holy ghost.
Amen.
For as much as you have consented in holy wedlock and have witnessed the same before
God and this Christian gathering,
I hereby confirm, as Christ' servant, this holy union.
I wonder if this is a good thing.
You saw how happy she was.
- I'm thinking of the children.
- They'll get used to it, dear mama.
He's a devil of a lady killer, the Bishop is.
You don't know that for sure, Carl.
I don't know why I just want to cry.
They should have taken a honeymoon.
I invited them to our house in Provence, but Emilie refused.
That's not so strange.
She has great respect for her new husband.
He's a handsome man, whatever you say.
- I expect he has false teeth.
- Petra, don't be silly.
His mother was nice.
They say the sister's a bitch.
I've a feeling we'll have Emilie back... quite soon.
Closed the children don't appear to have an appetite.
Everything's new and strange to them.
You must understand, Henrietta.
Perhaps they're turning up their noses at the food.
Let's be happy on our first evening together.
I have no desire to spoil it, but in the future --
Yes, I might as well mention it now.
In the future no one may leave the table without having eaten up --
Dearest Henrietta,
I'll tell my children what to do.
There's a basic rule in this house which no one must break, not even you, dear Emilie, and that is respect for the temporal gifts.
I think you've misunderstood an essential point, dearest Henrietta.
But I suggest we postpone this discussion to a more suitable time.
Forgive me, dear Emilie.
I am forgetting myself.
I'm sure you're a more capable housewife than I.
I'll ask your advice in all things.
Edvard has admonished me a hundred times.
It's not easy to realize one has become superfluous!
That will do, Henrietta.
Perhaps I may be allowed to share that we are early risers in this house, both weekdays and Sundays.
At 6:00 we gather for morning prayers in Edvard's study.
I'd also like to mention that we make our own beds and tidy our rooms.
In this house, punctuality, cleanliness and order are the rule.
Don't be alarmed, children.
My daughter makes it sound worse than it actually is.
We'll start out very gently.
I'm not sure I understand.
If you mean to apply a new method of upbringing --
Not at all, dear Emilie.
I'm convinced that the children will soon realize how fun it is to perform one's duties conscientiously.
It's all to be like a game.
My children don't care for that sort of game, and neither do I.
Time will tell, dear Emilie.
Let us bring our hands together and thank God for this meal.
Thank you, dear lord, for what we have received, and may we with generous hearts share our abundance with those who hunger and thirst.
Amen.
Justina, please show Fanny and Alexander to the nursery.
It's late and high time for young people to go to rest.
They're coming now.
Into bed, both of you!
Now we'll say our prayers.
Thank you, God, for this day.
Please make me good.
May your angel stay by me through the night.
God bless papa and mama and grandpapa and grand --
And uncle Edvard.
And uncle Edvard, myself and my brothers and sisters and cousins, uncles and aunts,
Vega, ester, Maj, Siri, Berta, Alida, Lisen, and uncle Isak and everybody else.
Amen.
Good night, Alexander.
Justina, I'd like to speak to you about tomorrow.
What's that book you're reading, Alexander?
What's that book you're reading, Alexander?
Good night, my boy.
Good night, my child.
God bless you.
Good night, uncle Edvard.
My dearest wish is for us to live at peace with one another.
Love cannot be commanded, but we can show respect and consideration.
You go ahead, my dear.
I'll come later.
Whose doll house is this?
Fifteen years ago, two little girls lived in this room.
They drowned in the river with their mother.
- Perhaps the house is haunted.
- There are no such things as ghosts.
- Did they live in this room?
- I think this was the nursery.
Good night. Sleep well.
I think we've got a terrible stepfather.
And the sister is crazy.
And that tub of lard that has to be fed.
I don't want to live here.
You have to give me time.
Much has to be changed.
Some things will go quickly, others will take time.
The main thing is not to lose heart.
Why did you marry the Bishop?
Because I love him.
Now let us sleep. Things will seem better when we're not so tired.
Don't play Hamlet, my son.
I'm not queen Gertrude, your kind stepfather isn't the king of Denmark, and this is not Ellsinore castle, even if it does look rather gloomy.
Hell and damnation.
Come, Fanny.
I'll show you something.
The windows are barred.
They can't be opened.
THE FOURTH ACT
EVENTS OF SUMMER
Is that you, old Isak?
How nice of you to call.
No, you're not disturbing me.
I was just sitting with my eyes closed.
Sleeping?
You know I never sleep.
Everyone's abandoned me.
It's the annual excursion to the outer cliffs.
Gustav Adolf doesn't change plans, even if it's raining cats and dogs.
When they left at 10:00, the weather was fine, but clouds have gathered over the mainland.
There's not a soul here.
Won't you come out here for once?
Come now, don't be so stubborn.
You can't sit in your awful shop the whole summer.
You want me to come to you?
I've sat here three days with a sprained ankle.
I was playing hopscotch with Jenny, so I've only myself to blame.
I'm not complaining.
I'm very comfortable.
What did you say?
There's such static on the line,
I can't hear what you're saying.
It's thundering somewhere, but it doesn't seem to be coming this way.
Yes, exactly, my friend.
Actually I'm very worried.
No, we haven't heard anything.
Emilie only told us she'd be staying in town all summer.
This isn't good, Isak.
I feel sick when I think of that big house with its thick walls.
It's no place for children in the summer.
I can't hear a word you're saying.
It's hopeless.
Isak, can you hear me?
You sound very far away.
I'm going to hang up now.
I'll call you back in an hour.
I wonder if it isn't time for a little cognac.
Yes, I think it is.
- Good day, Mrs. Ekdahl.
- Why, it's Maj! How nice.
Come in, dear child.
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
Not at all.
Give me a kiss.
That's nice.
Very pretty.
Did you make it yourself?
Yes.
A pretty pattern.
So you didn't go on the excursion?
No, I wouldn't fit in the boat with my big belly.
Nonsense.
- Is something wrong?
- I'm silly to worry.
Let's sit here.
You're worried about the children?
Alexander and I agreed to write.
I've written seven letters.
And you've received no reply?
One postcard three weeks ago.
"Dear Maj. We are well.
Uncle Edvard took us to..." the botanical gardens.
"We learned about rare flowers."
"Thank you for your letters.
I'll write when I get some time.
Love from Alexander.
Fanny sends her love."
We mustn't underestimate Emilie.
She's perfectly capable of looking after her children.
We're worrying for no reason.
I came to the family before Fanny was born.
They're my children too.
You're going already?
I wanted to speak with you, since I knew you were alone.
Stay a moment.
Thank you for your kindness, but I promised to have dinner ready when they came home.
I haven't put the steak in the oven yet.
Dear child, are things that bad?
Yes.
- Is it the cafe?
- That too.
Has Gustav Adolf been pestering you?
I don't want to hurt him.
He's so kind.
What worries me most is the children.
I'm sorry to be crying.
I'm behaving badly.
Forgive me.
Supper time.
Then you are to go straight to bed.
The tray can be left until tomorrow.
Mrs. Tander sent some cookies for you.
I'll be upset if miss Vergerus finds out I gave these to you.
Hasn't mother returned?
No, your mother has not returned.
She said she'd be back this evening.
Oh, dear,
I don't know what to say.
Why do you keep sighing like that?
I haven't been in this house long, thank goodness... but Mrs. Tander, who's been here since the first wife, could tell you a thing or two.
Would you like a cookie?
- Yes, thank you.
- What does Mrs. Tander say?
That it was the same in the first wife's day.
Only worse.
- Poor children.
- You mean us?
No, I don't mean you.
I mean the poor little ones who found their grave in the dark river outside.
Their mother tried to save them, but she was pulled down by the current.
They found them later by the bridge.
They clung tightly to each other as if they were one big body.
The arms had to be sawn off to get the bodies into separate coffins.
Mrs. Tander says that since then, it has never been quiet in this house.
There are no ghosts.
I don't mean to frighten you... but this house does funny things to you.
Look at my hand.
Skin's been completely ripped off, stripped down to the flesh.
I was taking his grace his coffee.
When I grabbed the doorknob, the skin stuck and ripped off.
Someone laughed behind me.
I heard it clearly and turned around.
But there was no one there.
I feel sorry for anyone who --
I shouldn't chatter on like this.
I'll keep quiet.
I'll close the door now.
Don't worry.
Your mother will probably be back tomorrow, and his grace will personally release you from captivity.
- I've seen them.
- Who?
The woman and the children.
Is that the truth?
Are you telling the truth, Alexander?
Word of honour as a Swedish citizen.
Where did you see them?
I had been in the library with that man who married my mother.
He'd been lecturing me.
I don't remember why.
I was passing through the dining room... and it was unusually bright.
Then I saw a little girl in the doorway.
She ran past me without a sound.
Then I saw the older girl, with the dark hair and big eyes.
She stopped and looked at me and motioned to me to turn around.
And there in the bright sunlight... stood the woman in her black dress.
She said in a faint, almost inaudible voice... not to be afraid, that she had something to tell me.
What did she say?
I don't want to frighten anyone, but these were her very words:
"I want you to know our secret.
Your stepfather, my husband, locked me and my children in the bedchamber.
For five days and nights he kept us without food and water.
In our misery we decided to escape.
We tied sheets together and tried to climb down to the finger of land sticking out into the deep, swirling water.
My daughters went first, but they fell headfirst into the water and were dragged under.
I tried to save them but was sucked down into a black whirlpool that grabbed my clothes.
Underwater I grasped my children's hands and drew them to me."
That's devilish.
Get to bed.
I said get to bed.
What time is it?
His grace has forbidden me to speak to you.
I'll be angry if you don't keep quiet.
Him and his stories!
Did you see that?
- The lightning struck.
- It was nearby.
I hope the damn cathedral went to hell.
What if God punishes you for saying that?
If a big know-it-all like him punishes a runt like me for so little, then he's just the dirty bastard I suspect he is.
Listen, he's playing the flute.
If we concentrate on him dying, then he will.
But we have to start together.
One, two, three:
Die, you devil!
- He's still playing.
- Let's try again.
One, two, three:
Die, you devil!
Mrs. Tander wants to know if your grace will have supper alone.
Tell her I don't want any supper.
A glass of milk and a sandwich in my room will be sufficient.
Thank you, sir.
I'll tell her.
Was there something else?
I don't know.
I don't know how to say it.
It's so unpleasant. It might seem --
Well?
Sir, I can't stand here in the doorway.
Come in, then, and close the door.
You said I was to keep an eye on the children, listen to their conversation and tell you of anything unusual.
Well?
Alexander made up a terrible story.
Really?
It was about --
Oh, it's so awful I don't know how to get it out.
He says you locked your first wife up, and she was drowned with her children when they tried to escape.
- That's all, sir.
- You can go.
Yes, Oscar, that's how it is.
One is old and a child at the same time.
What became of those long years in between that seemed so important at the time?
I sit here growing melancholy, thinking time was all too short.
Your father used to say I was sentimental.
He wasn't known as a particularly sensitive man.
He was both angry and indignant when he died.
He never thought life was cruel or unfair or beautiful.
He just lived and didn't care to comment.
He left that to me.
And when I went on about life, he laughed and called me sentimental.
But I was an artist.
As an artist,
I had a right to be emotional.
Oscar, my dear boy.
I may be worrying for no reason, but when you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, you immediately start worrying.
May I take your hand?
I remember your hand as a child.
It was small and firm and dry.
And your wrist was so awfully slender.
I enjoyed being a mother.
I enjoyed being an actress, too, but I preferred being a mother.
I liked having a big belly, and I didn't give two shakes about the theatre then.
It's all acting anyway.
Some roles are nice, others not so nice.
I played a mother.
I played Juliet and Margareta.
Then suddenly I played a widow or a grandmother.
One role follows the other.
The thing is not to shrink from them.
But what became of it all?
Can you tell me that, my boy?
You're a good boy to listen to your old mother's soliloquies, as Isak calls them.
Yes, you're a good boy, Oscar... and I grieved terribly when you passed away.
That was a strange role to play.
My feelings came from deep in my body.
Even though I could control them... they shattered reality, if you know what I mean.
Reality has remained broken ever since... and, oddly enough, it feels more real that way.
So I don't bother to mend it.
I just don't care anymore if nothing makes sense.
Oscar, my dear boy?
- Yes, mama.
- Are you sad?
I'm worried.
About the children?
Yes.
Get up.
Your stepfather wants to talk to you.
Get dressed.
Your stepfather wants to talk to you.
Hurry up!
Who's there?
It's just me.
Alexander, my boy.
In the presence of your sister and Justina you have accused me of having murdered my wife and children.
What?
Justina, please repeat what you told me.
Alexander said he had seen your first wife and children.
She spoke to him and said that the bishop had locked them all up without food and water.
On the fifth day they tried to escape but drowned in the attempt.
- Do you recognize the story?
- No.
- So Justina has given false testimony?
- She could have dreamt it.
Justina, are you prepared to confirm your statement under oath?
Yes, your grace.
Good, Justina.
Fanny, did you hear Alexander's story?
No.
So you maintain that Justina was either lying or dreaming?
Yes.
Please come here, Alexander.
Are you prepared to swear to it?
Of course.
It's a mortal sin to swear falsely.
It's called perjury and is severely punished.
Really?
Lay your hand on the bible and say after me:
"I, Alexander Ekdahl... swear by holy writ and by the living God... that all I have said, say and will say... is the whole truth and nothing but the truth."
Alexander, my boy.
You remember that the two of us had an important conversation about a year ago.
It concerned certain moral questions.
It wasn't really a conversation.
What do you mean?
The bishop spoke and Alexander said nothing.
And felt ashamed, perhaps, on account of your lies.
I've grown wiser since then.
You mean you lie better.
More or less.
I don't know what you imagine.
Do you think you can besmirch another person's honour with impunity?
Do you think you can lie and get away with perjury without consequence?
Do you think this is a game, Alexander?
Or a play in which the children get to make up their lines?
I think the bishop hates Alexander.
That's what I think.
Oh, so that's what you think.
I'll tell you something that may come as a surprise.
I don't hate you.
I love you.
But the love I feel for you and your mother and sister is not blind and sloppy.
It is strong and harsh.
- Do you hear what I say?
- No.
You're hardening your heart.
Moreover, you misjudge the situation.
- I am much stronger than you are.
- I don't doubt it.
I mean stronger spiritually.
Because I have truth and justice on my side.
I know you'll confess in a little while.
Your confession and punishment will be a relief to you.
You're a wise little man, Alexander.
You realize that the game is up... but you are proud and stubborn... and of course you are ashamed.
I've forgotten what I'm to confess.
Have you now.
What does the bishop want
Alexander to confess?
You know I have means at my disposal.
I didn't, but I do now.
In my childhood, parents were not so soft-hearted.
They had the cane.
I have one too.
It's an ordinary carpet beater, but it can dance a fine step!
If that didn't work, we had other effective means, namely castor oil.
There you see the bottle and a glass.
A few mouthfuls of this and you're more docile.
If that didn't help, there was a dark and cold cubby-hole where you sat for a few hours until the rats started sniffing at your face.
Why must I be punished?
That is obvious, my boy.
You have a weakness in your character.
You can't distinguish lies from truth.
So far they are just child's lies, however dreadful they may be.
But soon you will be a grown man, Alexander, and life punishes liars ruthlessly and indiscriminately.
The punishment is to teach you a love of truth.
I confess I made it up about locking your wife and children in.
- Do you also confess to perjury?
- I suppose so.
Now you've won a great victory.
A victory over yourself.
Which punishment do you choose?
Cane, castor oil or the dark cubby-hole?
- How many strokes of the cane?
- Ten.
Then I choose the cane.
Take two cushions and put them on the table.
Pull your pants down.
Bend over.
Stand up.
- You have something to say to me.
- No.
You must ask my forgiveness.
I won't.
Then I must cane you until you think better of it.
Can't you spare us both that unpleasant experience?
I'll never apologize.
You won't apologize?
No.
Bend over.
No more, please!
Will you ask forgiveness now?
Yes.
Button your pants and blow your nose.
Lend him a handkerchief, Justina.
What do you have to say now?
Alexander asks the bishop for forgiveness.
Speak up.
I want everyone to hear your regret.
Alexander asks the bishop for forgiveness.
For the lies and the perjury.
You do understand that I punished you out of love?
Yes!
Kiss my hand, Alexander.
- May I go to bed now?
- Yes, you may.
But so that you may contemplate the day's events in peace and quiet... you're to sleep in the attic.
Justina will provide a mattress and a blanket.
At 6:00 in the morning you will be let out.
Understood?
Yes, your grace!
Helena, it's hardest on the children.
They're punished for the slightest misdeed.
His mother locks them up, puts them to bed in the middle of the day.
A week ago,
Fanny refused to finish her porridge.
She had to sit there all night.
She threw up on the plate.
At last she finished it.
He's mad with jealousy but doesn't realize it's mutual.
My poor Emilie.
How could I be so blind?
How could I feel compassion for that man?
I'm an actress.
I should have seen through his pretence.
But I had lived practically alone since Fanny was born.
I hated my occasional emotional storms.
Oscar was my best friend.
You know that, Helena.
You know how fond I was of him, how sincere my grief was when he left us.
I don't blame you for anything.
I saw nothing, understood nothing.
He spoke to me of another life.
A life of demands, of purity, of joy in the performance of duty.
I'd never heard such words.
There seemed to be a light around him when he spoke to me.
At the same time,
I could tell he was lonely, unhappy... haunted by fear and bad dreams.
He assured me I would save him.
He said together with the children we'd live in nearness to God.
In the truth.
The truth
- that was the most important part.
I was so thirsty.
I know it sounds dramatic and overstrung, Helena... but I thirsted for truth and felt I'd been living a lie.
I must go.
A carriage is waiting at the gate.
I'm afraid something might have happened while I've been here.
I'm in constant fear that Alexander will say something to displease him.
Alexander is so foolhardy.
I've tried to warn him, but he can't see that his stepfather is a dangerous opponent who's just waiting for the right opportunity to crush him.
You must leave him, Emilie.
I'm pregnant.
Nevertheless, you must --
Forgive me for interrupting.
I've asked him for a divorce.
He refuses.
I tell him that I'll leave just the same.
Then he explains in detail what will happen.
In a court of law,
I'll lose on grounds of "desertion," as it's called.
The children will be taken from me, to be brought up by him.
I've written in secret to a friend of mine who's a lawyer.
He's confirmed what Edvard says.
I am shut in and can no longer breathe.
I'm dying, Helena!
I hate that man so violently that I could --
Don't mention that I've been here.
To anybody.
Mother.
Father.
If you're coming to visit... please remember I'm scared of ghosts... and that you're actually dead.
Don't sneak up on me from behind.
I might go mad from fear.
You wouldn't want that, right?
I don't understand why I always have to see dead people when it makes me sick.
Damn it!
Ah, hell!
My name's Pauline.
My sister Esmeralda is over by the crucifix.
- She's mad at you, Alexander.
- Why?
She wants us to punish you.
Why do you look so surprised?
- You know very well why we're mad.
- No, I don't.
You lied about our father.
You said he locked us up.
That's not true.
The floodgates had been closed for several weeks, and the river had frozen over.
We'd gotten new skates for Christmas.
But the ice broke, and we fell into the water.
Mother tried to save us, but the current dragged us under the ice.
Now you know the truth, wretched boy.
My sister and I thought we'd free our father from you and your hatred.
We'll scare the wits out of you so you end up in the hospital, locked in a cell, chained hand and foot.
Please, don't frighten me!
- Give me the key!
- Edvard has forbidden it.
Give me the key now!
Edvard has forbidden it!
You're hurting me!
Emilie, you can't!
Carl, don't forget the cognac.
There's none left.
Take your damn paint box!
Listen to me.
I told you, there's none left.
- Alma, we're to go up to see grandmama.
- What are you shouting about?
I'm just shouting!
Punch will do just as well!
The old girl's not here.
She's probably in the dining room.
Good evening, mama.
We came to see how you are.
I'm splendid.
I hope you aren't lonely.
Lonely?
I love being alone.
Vega was bitten by a wasp.
A wasp stings, my dear.
It has a stinger just like your old man.
Don't pinch me.
And Petra fell in the lake and got soaked.
Where shall I serve supper?
I don't want any.
- How's the wasp sting?
- Not worth talking about.
And mama is busy with the old man's photographs.
How many thousands have you sorted by now?
Here's one of you and your brothers.
You couldn't have been more than five years old.
- You can already tell which brother...
- Who is this beautiful woman?
Did it rain on you the whole time?
No, not at all, dearest mama.
Not a cloud over the outer islands, but we saw the rain over the mainland, and heard the thunder it's rained all day here.
This woman with the low neckline was one of papa's lady friends.
You're mistaken.
We were at school together.
She married a count, had 12 children and became as big as a house.
I always admired your skilful way of handling papa's little adventures.
We must be going.
Mr. Ohman and his lovely wife are going to stop by.
I'm going into town tomorrow.
Anything I can do for you?
Thank you, Gusten.
I don't need anything.
But I'd like to talk to you about Maj.
What the hell is it now?
She's got it good.
Now I'm damned angry
- if you'll excuse me, mama.
Calm down, Gusten!
He loses his temper at the mention of Maj's name.
I just want to say --
You have to realize Maj is not your private plaything.
Thanks to alma's broad-mindedness, she's a member of our family, and she's expecting my grandchild.
In your dictatorial way, you've decided her future.
I don't give a damn --
I don't like it when you swear in your mother's presence.
You hear me, Gusten?
I like the girl.
I wish her well.
I want to ensure her future.
I don't want her to be dependent on the family's benevolence if I die.
She's accepted my suggestions.
She doesn't need any protectors, especially against me.
Stop your twaddle!
Don't make me out as a dictator!
Maj has decided it all herself!
I like her.
I'm kind to her.
Alma's kind to her.
Now I'm hurt, let me tell you.
Damned hurt!
There's no reason to side with Maj against me!
I'm fond of her.
Alma's fond of her.
She is loved in the same way as Jenny,
Petra and Putte.
Well, not exactly in the same way, but almost.
She's good to me.
She doesn't think I'm fat and old and disgusting.
Nobody thinks that, by the --
I've a soft spot for the ladies.
What's to be done about it?
That's nothing to giggle at.
Maj is to go her own way through life, and I'm going to give her solid ground to stand on.
That's enough said about that.
The opera singer said he would stop by with his wife and children. Come now.
Good-bye, mama.
Give me a kiss.
I don't want you and alma to sit gossiping about Maj's future.
I'll see to that!
Or rather, she will.
Good night, mama.
Come, alma.
- I'll be back in a couple of hours.
- Like hell you will! Come on!
Calm down or you'll have a stroke.
I am calm.
You're the one who's shouting.
I want an end to all that gossip between you and mama!
Carlchen, you can't demand that I ask her.
Mama distrusts me and it's your fault.
Therefore I can't ask her.
I don't see how I can say anything.
- Tell her I'm desperate.
- You can tell her better yourself.
Make it clear I've been contemplating suicide.
Is that really true?
We can be poor together.
I will to work.
Idiot. Bonehead. Fool.
"I will work."
I'm sorry. I will work.
What do you want me to say, mein Carlchen?
Don't you have any imagination, you imbecile?
Say I look unhappy, that I've stopped eating, that I lie awake at night.
Yes, you do lie awake with insomnia.
It damn well is insomnia!
Say that I've grown quiet, that I never laugh, and when I do, it sounds dreadful. Understand?
Don't just come right out with it, damn it.
Lead her to suspect I've spoken of suicide.
Don't say that terrible word, or I'll start crying.
Stupid slut.
Do you think of suicide, mein Schatz?
Only when I look at you.
Why are you so cruel?
Don't go, Goddamn it!
Where are you going?
Why the hell are you leaving?
I won't talk to your mother.
I'm going home.
Du bist bose.
I have to cry.
You don't understand that I love you.
Now I'm crying, and I won't be able to stop.
Dear God, my creator, why must I go on acting in this wretched farce?
Lydia, stop!
Let me help you.
Oh, Goddamn it!
Just look at this.
Pick up your shawl.
Damn it all! My leg!
Grandma.
- Shouldn't you be in bed?
- We sneaked out.
What will your mother say?
She won't find out.
Unless grandma tattles, of course.
What do you want from your old grandma?
Welcome home, Emilie.
You were gone a long time.
We almost began to worry.
Mrs. Tander wonders if you'd like something to eat.
I'm not hungry.
I'll let her know.
- Will you be coming to bed soon?
- When the children are asleep.
I'll be reading in the library.
Please don't be long.
Good night, children.
We had actually decided
Alexander would sleep in the attic tonight.
But I understand that decision has changed.
Yes, it has.
Very well.
Perhaps it's best.
- Good night, Fanny.
- Good night, uncle Edvard.
Good night, Alexander.
Is he asleep?
No, I'm not.
Then you can also answer me when I bid you good night.
I can't.
You can't?
What nonsense is that?
Alexander doesn't wish the bishop a good night.
You have a sense of humour.
I like that.
Well, did you see your mother-in-law and relatives?
Was it a nice visit?
Did it rain?
It rained and thundered here all day.
Well, a little moisture's good, at least for the farmers.
Alexander and I had a little review this afternoon.
The usual:
He couldn't distinguish fantasy from reality.
But we clarified the concepts.
He's not stupid, that Alexander.
He's not stupid, but he's very unforgiving.
"Alexander doesn't wish the bishop a good night."
That's really priceless.
You're not saying anything.
Are you mad about something?
You locked up the children.
A safety measure, Emilie.
I wanted to guarantee you would return.
You abused Alexander.
You're so dramatic.
I punished him.
That's my duty as his guardian.
Besides, the punishment was mild in comparison to the offence.
He's bleeding, and the skin is broken.
I gave him a few lashes.
His buttocks will sting for a few days, but it's a healthy sting.
He'll think twice before fabricating new lies, or fantasies, if that's the term you prefer.
And the humiliation?
Punishment given out of love can never be humiliating in the deeper sense.
Love and respect have nothing in common, and the language of love... can be rather harsh.
You're one to speak of love.
You allow yourself to be contemptuous.
Shall we end this conversation and go to bed?
You locked him in the attic.
Of course.
He needed to be alone.
You know he's afraid of the dark.
The nights are bright this time of year, and those with a clear conscience have nothing to fear.
I could kill you.
You'll harm the baby with thoughts like that.
Our baby will never be born.
Be careful of what you say.
You don't frighten me.
I must frighten you, Emilie.
But I do so with a heavy heart, since I love you in spite of everything.
You're not strong, Emilie.
The pregnancy is draining your strength.
From now on you'll stay in a room that we'll make as comfortable as possible.
Henrietta and my mother will take turns looking after you.
For the time being, your freedom will be somewhat limited.
But we must be very careful.
You should also know that the slightest attempt to rebel or contact the outside world will affect your children's welfare.
By being irresponsible, you've forced me to take responsibility, not only for your children, but also for you.
It's a heavy burden.
I feel a terrible loneliness.
I'm an ordinary man with great faults, but I exercise a powerful office that always overshadows the person holding it.
A man becomes a slave to such an office, with no right to opinions of his own.
THE FIFTH ACT
DEMONS
Good day, Mr. Jacobi.
Good day,
Miss Vergerus.
What is it?
Is His Grace --
He is not to be disturbed.
May I speak to his wife?
She is indisposed, resting in her room --
And not to be disturbed.
My mother is out and I am busy.
His Grace might be annoyed if --
What is this concerning?
Some months ago,
His Grace proposed a business deal.
Really? I don't recall.
Of course not, miss Vergerus.
His grace is careful to spare his family such trivial worries.
What worries of his could concern you?
Please don't force me to be vulgar.
To be candid, Mr. Jacobi,
I find you unpleasant.
I've neither the time nor the inclination to speak with you.
- Good-bye, Mr. Jacobi.
- A pecuniary predicament.
I beg your pardon?
Your brother, His Grace, was in a pecuniary predicament.
- May I sit down?
- Not there! There.
In a peculiar way
- I don't know why -
I appreciate your straightforwardness.
And I do not appreciate your fawning.
What business do you have with my brother?
None at all, as far as I know.
I'm tired of your riddles.
Tell me what's on your mind and go.
I must speak to His Grace first.
It's a matter of money.
A lot of money.
Does my brother owe you money?
On the contrary.
It's like this:
In November His Grace wanted to borrow money.
Regrettably, Jews have certain principles, like never lending money to the clergy.
He suggested I should buy that chest for a reasonable sum.
I declined.
So you declined.
Foolishly so, since I've now changed my mind.
I'd like to buy that chest, and at almost any price.
Almost.
I will get my brother.
I told you not to disturb me.
Mr. Jacobi wants to buy the chest.
That man hangs on like vermin!
Stay where you are.
I'll come get you in a few minutes.
Take your shoes off.
Forgive an old man's unfortunate weakness, your grace.
- You wish to buy the chest?
- Yes.
For how much?
Here is the sum.
It seems you've changed your mind.
I may have an interested buyer.
- I'm being cheated, of course.
- You're free to say no.
- Do you have you the money with you?
- The money?
The money!
Of course, your grace.
I have large bills right here.
Let me see.
Yes, here they are.
- Give me the money.
- Of course.
If I may have your grace's name on the contract?
Forgive me if I retire.
I shall miss you, miss Vergerus.
Do not take anything that is not your due.
Suspicions recoil on those who harbour them.
Your grace will want to ensure that
I'm not taking more than my due.
That's quite all right.
I just wanted to return the signed contract.
Please have a seat.
What would you say about that painting?
A beautiful and valuable work.
Would it interest you?
My resources are regrettably a bit strained at present.
- How is your wife?
- It's kind of you to inquire.
She is indisposed.
This sudden heat disagrees with her.
- May I pay my respects?
- Unfortunately not.
I understand.
Here is a letter for her from old Mrs. Ekdahl.
- I shall give it to her.
- You're too kind.
Filthy Jewish swine!
You damned, filthy Jewish swine!
You thought you could cheat me.
You'll regret this, you repulsive, hook-nosed bastard!
Calm down!
That swine is trying to steal my children!
He can't.
I have the key to the nursery.
Don't touch them!
Come on, quickly!
Come here.
First and foremost, let's have something to eat.
This is my nephew, Aron.
Let's go to the table.
I'd like to sleep.
Our guests are tired.
Have you tidied the room and made the beds?
I've done all you asked, uncle.
This is Aron's puppet theatre.
If you ask him nicely, he may give a performance.
Behind this door lives my nephew Ismael.
He's sick.
The door must always be kept shut.
Remember that, both of you.
Sometimes he sings, even at night.
It's nothing to worry about.
You'll get used to it.
Mind the steps, Fanny, so you don't trip.
Now down this hallway.
It's a bit cold and damp, because we don't dare light a fire or open the windows.
Straight ahead, and then through that little door.
It's not so unusual.
This will be your home for the time being.
I hope you'll like it.
Go to bed now.
Good night, Fanny.
Good night, Alexander.
Lock the door at night and don't open it for anyone.
- Don't forget to say your prayers.
- Don't go.
You want me to stay?
Then I'll sit here.
I'll go and see to Ismael.
My name is Aron.
Ismael is my brother.
Our parents died when we were small.
Good night.
What kind of book is that?
It's a book of stories, thoughts, words of wisdom and prayers.
It's written in Hebrew.
You understand that language?
- Shall I read you something?
- Yes, please.
Uncle Isak?
Are you sure His Grace can't come and get us?
You can put your mind at ease.
Come on, read.
It may be a bit choppy, since I have to translate.
A young man journeys down an endless road in the company of many others.
The road leads across a rocky plain where nothing grows.
The sun's fire burns from morning to evening.
They can't find shade or coolness anywhere.
A harrowing wind stirs up huge dust clouds.
The youth is driven forward by an incomprehensible anxiety... and tormented by a scorching thirst.
Sometimes he asks himself or one of his travelling companions about the goal of their pilgrimage.
But the answer is uncertain and tentative.
He himself has forgotten why he ever set out on his journey.
He's also forgotten his native land... and the journey's final destination.
Suddenly, one evening he finds himself standing in a forest.
Dusk sets in and all is quiet.
Perhaps the evening wind sighs through the tall trees.
He stands amazed... but also anxious and suspicious.
He's all alone... and he discovers his hearing is weak, since his ears are inflamed from the merciless light of day.
His mouth and throat are parched from the long pilgrimage.
His lips are cracked, pressed together around curses and harsh words.
So he doesn't hear the ripple of flowing water and doesn't notice its reflection in the dusk.
He stands deaf and blind at the edge of the spring... unaware of its existence.
Like a sleepwalker he wanders unaware between the sparkling pools.
His blind skill is remarkable, and soon he's back onto the road... in the burning, shadowless light.
One night by the camp fire he's seated near an old man who's telling some children about the forests and springs.
The youth recalls what he's been through, but faintly and indistinctly... as in a dream.
He turns to the old man, sceptical yet courteous, and asks,
"where does all this water come from?"
"It comes from a mountain whose peak is covered by a mighty cloud."
"What kind of cloud?" the youth asks.
The old man answers,
"every man carries within him hopes, fears and longings.
Every man shouts out his despair or bears it in his mind.
Some pray to a particular God.
Others address their cries to the void.
This despair, this hope... this dream of deliverance, all these cries, all these tears are gathered over thousands and thousands of years... and condense into an immeasurable cloud around a high mountain.
Out of the cloud rain flows down the mountain... forming the streams and rivers that flow through the great forests.
That's how the springs are formed where you can quench your thirst... wash your badly burnt face... cool your blistered feet.
Everybody has at some time heard of the mountain, the cloud and the springs... but most people anxiously remain on the dusty road in the blazing light."
"Why do they stay there?"
Asks the youth in great astonishment.
"I certainly don't know," replies the old man.
"Perhaps they've convinced themselves and each other that they'll reach their unknown destination by evening."
"What unknown destination?"
Asks the young man.
The old man shrugs his shoulders.
"In all probability the destination does not exist.
It's deception or imagination.
I myself am on my way to the forests and the springs.
I was there once when I was young... and now I'm trying to find my way back.
It's not easy, let me tell you."
The next morning the youth set out with the old man to seek the mountain, the cloud, the forests and the rippling springs.
Shall we have a seat?
- May I tempt you with a glass of sherry?
- No, thank you.
No.
- An almond cookie? My sister's specialty.
- No, thank you.
Not that either.
I want the children back.
This is a small town, and tongues will soon be wagging.
I fear you've misunderstood the reason for our visit.
We're here on behalf of the family to ask that you set Emilie and the children free.
We can't say with certainty that we know what has occurred.
We only know that our dear
Emilie is extremely unhappy and that the children hate the Bishop's palace.
We certainly understand that divorce is a painful step for a highly placed servant of the church, and we'd like to make appropriate compensation for your painful loss.
I've spoken with my mother, and we're ready to place a considerable sum at your disposal, which you may, of course, use... for charity, a foundation, or some other purpose close to your heart.
We agree that everything must be handled with utmost discretion, and my mother is willing to take
Emilie and the children to Italy and remain there for at least a year.
Let me first say that I fully appreciate the respect and generosity the Ekdahls extend to me in this difficult hour.
At the same time, it's necessary, though painful, for me to speak very clearly.
The children have been abducted from their home.
They must unconditionally and without delay be returned to their legal parents.
Every delay will cause all of us - not least their mother - unspeakable suffering.
When the children are returned,
I'll be prepared to listen to any proposals the Ekdahl family may have.
But to avoid any further misunderstandings...
I must make it clear that a divorce... is absolutely out of the question.
I'm very grateful for your precise and clear standpoint.
But I'm obliged to mention that the children will never... be returned to the Bishop's palace to be subjected to the suffering that up till now has befallen them.
Perhaps I should add that on this point the Ekdahls are in complete agreement.
The matter is therefore not open to discussion.
The children are part of our family, and we therefore consider ourselves responsible for their well-being... and development.
It grieves me... that the Ekdahl family should be dictating conditions.
Especially since, as their stepfather,
I have the law on my side.
And furthermore, as a representative of the church,
I have the moral advantage.
But we have the children, my dear brother.
I'm glad you're able to laugh in this awkward situation.
Perhaps legal proceedings and police action will be unavoidable.
I doubt it, my dear Edvard.
You'd rather shit in your pants than suffer the disgrace of the parish hags whistling through their false teeth.
You may well have morality and the law on your side, old man, but bear in mind that I'm in league with immorality, and even were you to win in court, we who side with immorality will have spread so many credible rumours about your person, your way of life, your household, your sister, your servants, your sanity, your sexual excesses, your phoney hair, your hypocrisy, your hypochondria, and your lack of decency that you'll be forever forced to preach to Huguenots, hooligans and Eskimos!
I'm not saying this to frighten you, my esteemed friend.
I only wish to lay all the cards on the table.
So let me see you listen to reason.
If you have any, that is.
Your clownish antics are amusing.
I'd be inclined to laugh if your babble didn't contain what I would call a real and material threat.
Let me tell you something, my fine lord Bishop, something you might not understand.
I can see through you.
You're a cad of monumental proportions!
Shut up, Gustav Adolf!
Think of your blood pressure!
I must apologize, my dear Edvard.
Even if we have differing views in what seems to be an irresolvable conflict, we must behave like civilized beings.
I disassociate myself entirely from
Gustav Adolf's expressions and attitudes and assure you that he represents no one but himself.
He certainly does not voice the family's opinion.
My esteemed brother must forgive me.
A thousand apologies.
I'm a boor
- at least that's what my wife says.
I have no eye for people's inner qualities.
I drink too much.
I'm embarrassed. I apologize.
We'll say no more about it.
I'm prepared to listen to an honest man's honest opinion, even if he is a bit... brusque.
A glass of sherry?
I assure you it's quite good.
Thank you very much.
I'm awfully sorry.
I'm so fond of that silly Emilie, that silly little creature.
We love her. The whole family loves her.
Isn't that so, Carl?
And when our brother Oscar died, we didn't care for her sufficiently.
We have much to blame ourselves for.
One can be so damned slack and self-centred.
I said that to Alma this morning.
If we hadn't been so slack and self-centred, this would never have --
I don't think we can reach an agreement under present circumstances.
Let us consider our confidential and frank conversation as a cautious exploration.
I fear I do not share your cautious optimism.
I consider our negotiations terminated... and feel compelled to make my standpoint quite clear.
The children must be returned to their home within 12 hours.
Otherwise I'll be forced, though it conflicts with my principles, to report the matter to the police and the public prosecutor.
Is it conceivable that if the children were returned, we could begin informal talks about their future relations with us?
I'm a believer in firm rules and principles... a fact that in no way conflicts with my sincere and passionate love of freedom.
May I understand your statement as an indirect promise of future discussions regarding the sensitive question of Emilie's and the children's freedom of movement?
Disintegration in our lives... is due in large part to broken ties between people... who otherwise have the capacity to respect and love each other.
A cruel and incomprehensible mystery.
To think that a man like me, almost 220 pounds, with a fully grown beard and a developed mind... should have to sit here on this silly, uncomfortable chair and listen to this unmitigated hypocrite.
"Disintegration in our lives!"
Kiss me where my back changes its name!
You shut up, Carl.
Shut up!
While I tell this spiritual masturbator what we have up our sleeves.
Listen to me!
I'll tell you something,
Edvard Vergerus.
I've acquired your promissory notes.
You didn't know that, did you?
Yes, my friend.
110,000 kronor in debts.
So I'll be dictating conditions now.
Turning pale now, are you?
The holy man's looking pale, eh, Carl?
I'd say his nose even grew a bit too.
You're a special kind of bully,
Edvard Vergerus.
One thing I've learned in my profession is to recognize the smell of a bully, even if he wears a cassock.
And I know how bullies should be treated.
They must be bullied!
Emilie is to have her divorce, or I'll declare his holiness bankrupt!
Idiot.
What?
I said idiot.
You're an idiot.
I thought it honourable to tell him he doesn't have a chance.
I get so tired of you sometimes,
Gustav Adolf.
Really?
What stupid thing have I done now?
You'll soon see.
A moment ago we spoke of the advantage of putting our cards on the table.
I beg to return to that metaphor shortly.
To Mr. Ekdahl I'd like to say... that I pity him.
He has a poor opinion of the world and a simplistic view of people.
He suffers from the widespread misconception that man is ruled by his needs.
He believes that everything can be bought and sold.
Mr. Ekdahl is the son of one of the country's greatest artists.
Despite this he has grasped little or nothing... of the spirit's unlimited power over matter.
He is a wretched caliban, groping with clumsy hands for his dull tools.
I pity him and feel sincere compassion for him.
My esteemed Carl, I thank you for a respectful and dignified conversation.
I regret we have not come to an agreement.
Try sometime to tell your brother --
No, he would never understand... that there are people who have no needs... who are indifferent to money... who dismiss the world's luxuries, who happily allow themselves to be slandered because their conscience is clear before God the almighty.
Now, to return to our game of cards, which Mr. Ekdahl spoke of so wittily.
Allow me to play the last card.
Excuse me for a moment.
That man is the devil himself!
Have you ever seen such a cold-blooded scoundrel?
If you hadn't behaved like an idiot.
I admit it, and I'm sick about it.
No, that's not the word.
I'm terribly sorry.
- Be quiet, he's coming. Shut up!
- I'll shut up.
Dear, dear Gustav Adolf.
Dear Carl.
I can't begin to express my gratitude for your care and affection, but unfortunately you've misunderstood.
Isak Jacobi took it upon himself to abduct the children.
It's terrible and unbelievable.
It's nice and safe here.
Edvard is good to us, and we're very happy.
I implore you with all my heart to bring back my children.
It's true that I've been anxious and unhappy.
It's true that I went and talked to Helena.
It's true the children had difficulty adjusting to their new surroundings.
It's true we live a stricter and more serious life than at home.
But I'm happy and safe.
Edvard is goodness itself.
You must believe me.
I implore you with all my heart:
Bring back my children!
I cannot live without them!
Dear friends, do as I say.
It's all a terrible misunderstanding.
Farewell, gentlemen.
I have to pee.
Damn, there's no chamber pot.
It won't be easy to find the toilet in the dark.
I hope there aren't any ghosts.
Damn, I think I've lost my way.
Now I'm lost for sure.
It's not my fault it's all gone wrong.
I can't leave you.
I just can't.
It would be better if you'd take off for heaven.
You can't help us anyway.
I lived my whole life with you children and Emilie.
Death makes no difference.
What is it, Alexander?
Why can't you go to God and tell him to kill the Bishop?
Or doesn't God give a damn about you, or any of us?
Have you even seen God on the other side?
Not a bastard has a thought in his head.
Idiots, the whole bunch of 'em.
You must be gentle with people.
Aren't you coming to bed?
The clock has struck 4:00.
I can't sleep.
Neither can I.
Elsa's very sick.
We ought to send for the doctor.
He's coming in the morning.
- What are you drinking?
- Hot broth.
- It helps against insomnia.
- May I?
Be my guest.
Can't you forgive me?
I'm staying with you, aren't I?
I don't understand this sudden yielding.
Drink while it's hot.
- You insist that the children return?
- Yes.
In that case, it's hopeless.
I don't care if it's hopeless.
I care only for what is right.
Isn't that Elsa calling?
Stay here. I'll see to her.
Can I help you, aunt?
It's so dark.
What time is it?
Almost half past 4:00.
It's been a long night.
Try to get some sleep.
My legs hurt.
They're swollen and aching.
I've heard the universe is expanding.
Heavenly bodies are hurtling away from each other at a bewildering rate.
The universe is exploding, and we find ourselves at the very moment of explosion.
You once said you were always changing masks... until finally you didn't know who you were.
I have only one mask.
But it's branded into my flesh.
If I tried to tear it off --
I always thought people liked me.
I saw myself as wise, broad-minded and fair.
I had no idea... that anyone could hate me.
I don't hate you.
No, but your son does.
I'm afraid of him.
Who's behind the door?
It is God behind the door.
- Can't you come out?
- No living being may see God's face.
- What do you want?
- To prove that I exist.
This is the end of me.
Shall I show myself?
Now you will see me.
Here I come, Alexander.
- Admit you were scared.
- I wasn't a damned bit scared.
"This is the end of me."
Ouch! That hurts.
Don't cry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
At least not that much.
I've been working all night on this puppet.
A rich circus owner in England is mad about our puppets.
I heard you tiptoeing around.
Hear that?
My brother Ismael is awake.
He's singing.
Poor Ismael.
Human beings are more than he can bear.
Sometimes he gets furious.
Then he's dangerous.
Doctors say his intelligence is light-years beyond normal.
He reads continuously.
He's incredibly learned and knows everything by heart.
You said you'd been up all night, but I saw you asleep.
There are many strange things that can't be explained.
You realize that when you dabble in magic.
- Have you seen our mummy?
- No.
Come.
Look carefully, Alexander.
Can you see it breathing?
It's been dead 4,000 years, but it breathes.
I'll make the room dark.
- What do you see?
- It's shining.
Exactly.
No one knows why it's luminous.
No one can explain why.
The unknown makes people angry.
It's better to blame it on mirrors, machines and projections.
Then people laugh, and that's healthier from all viewpoints, especially financially.
Watch carefully now.
My father and mother ran a magic theatre in St. Petersburg.
One evening, in the middle of a performance... a real ghost appeared.
It was my father's aunt, who had died two days earlier.
The ghost lost her way among the machines and projectors.
It was a fiasco, and father had to refund the tickets.
- I know quite a bit about ghosts.
- Do you?
Uncle Isak says we're surrounded by different realities, one on top of the other.
There are swarms of ghosts, spirits, phantoms, souls, poltergeists, angels and demons.
He says the smallest pebble has a life of its own.
- More coffee?
- Yes, please.
Everything is alive, and everything is God or God's thought.
Not only good things, but the cruellest too.
What do you think?
If there is a God, then he's a shit, and I'd like to kick him in the butt.
Your theory is very interesting and appears to be justified.
Shall we take Ismael his breakfast?
For my part,
I'm an atheist.
If you've been raised as a magician and learned all the tricks since childhood, then you can do without supernatural interference.
As a magician,
I create the believable.
The audience provides the unbelievable.
You're definitely no idiot, Alexander, especially considering you're only nine.
- I'll be eleven in November.
- Here.
I've brought your breakfast.
Your sister gave me sleeping pills for my insomnia.
I had put three in the broth.
I didn't mean for you to drink it.
When you went to see Elsa,
I put in three more.
You will sleep soundly.
When you wake up,
I will be gone.
I'm going back to my children... to my home... and my family.
I'll change and you'll come back.
I'll never come back!
I'll poison your life!
I'll follow you from town to town!
I'll ruin your children's future!
Poor Edvard, you don't know what you're saying!
I am awake!
I'm horribly awake.
Help me into bed at least.
I can't see anymore... and I feel dizzy.
Are you there?
I can't see.
Ismael, I've brought your breakfast.
Good morning, Ismael.
This is Alexander Ekdahl, a friend.
Leave us alone, Aron.
Don't worry.
I won't eat him... even if he does look appetizing.
You can come back in half an hour.
- Go now, Aron.
- Uncle Isak...
Uncle Isak is an old goat and needn't know of Alexander's visit.
Go now.
No, thank you.
My name is Ismael, but you already know that.
"And he will be a wild man.
His hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him."
I'm considered dangerous.
That's why I'm locked up.
Dangerous in what way?
Write your name here.
The pencil's pretty dull, but it should still serve.
There, Alexander Ekdahl.
Now read what you've written.
It says "Ismael Retzinsky."
Perhaps we're the same person, with no boundaries.
Perhaps we flow through each other, stream through each other boundlessly and magnificently.
You bear such terrible thoughts... it's almost painful to be near you.
Yet it's also enticing.
- Do you know why?
- I don't think I want to know.
You've heard of making an image of someone you dislike and sticking pins in it?
It's a rather clumsy method when you think of the swift paths an evil thought can travel.
You're a strange little person.
You won't speak of that which is constantly in your thoughts.
You're thinking of a man's death.
Wait a moment.
I know who you're thinking of:
A tall man with fair, greying hair.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
He has clear blue eyes and a boyish face.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
He's asleep and dreams he's kneeling at the altar.
Above the altar hangs the crucified prophet.
In his dream he gets up and cries out,
"my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
There is no answer, not even a laugh.
Don't talk like that.
It is not I talking.
It is yourself.
You are not to hesitate.
He's sound asleep, plagued by nightmares.
Give me your hands.
It isn't really necessary, but it's safer.
The doors will be thrown open.
A scream will echo through the house.
- I don't want to.
- It's too late.
You have only one way to go, and I am with you.
I obliterate myself.
I merge into you, my child.
Don't be afraid.
I am with you.
I'm your guardian angel.
It is 5:00 in the morning, and the sun has just risen.
The doors are thrown open.
No, wait.
First a horrible scream echoes through the house.
A shapeless burning figure moves across the floor, screaming.
I don't want to.
Let me go! Let me go!
The police are here and insist on speaking to you.
Honoured, Mrs. Vergerus.
It is my painful duty, as the town's ranking administrator of justice, to have to inform you of the terrible circumstances surrounding your husband's horrible death.
Furthermore, according to the law of the land, and in the presence of this witness, chief inspector Jespersson,
I must conduct a short and,
I assure you, in all respects formal interrogation, for which I beg your forgiveness.
Your husband,
His Grace the Bishop, lost his life this morning under terrible circumstances.
May I, madam?
We think we've been able to determine the course of events.
Miss Elsa Bergius, who was gravely ill, lay in bed.
On her bedside table stood a lamp.
By some unfortunate accident, the lamp fell on the bed igniting her nightgown, hair and bed linens.
Blazing like a torch, she ran through the house and by chance made it into the Bishop's bedchamber.
According to His Grace's sister, miss Henrietta Vergerus, he was in a heavy sleep from a soporific you had given him earlier that night.
After a heated quarrel with your husband, you left the house at 4:20 a.m.
Miss Bergius flung herself on him, igniting his bedclothes and nightshirt.
His grace woke up and succeeded in freeing himself from the dying woman who was still ablaze.
But he could not extinguish the flames that were now engulfing him.
Old Mrs. Vergerus found her son with his body burnt and face charred.
He showed faint signs of life and said he was in unbearable agony.
Ten minutes later, the doctor and ambulance arrived on the scene, but by then His Grace had already been released from his suffering and had taken his last breath.
Although I can't overlook the fact that the sleeping aid you gave him possibly made the disaster worse,
I also cannot attach any serious importance to it.
Therefore, I must characterize the event as an ill-fated coincidence of extremely unfortunate circumstances.
Therefore I beg to extend to you my deepest, most sincere condolences.
Come, Jespersson.
Madame, I had the honour to wait upon you yesterday, but your maid showed me the door with an offensive message.
Monsieur le marquis,
I blush at your presumption and can only deplore the fact that my servants this morning were unable to show you the door once again.
You say that you love me, sir.
In that case, be so kind as to spare me your presence, because, frankly, it does me only harm, not to mention the anger over the embarrassment you caused me in the presence of her Majesty the queen.
Marquis, to what do we owe the honour of such an early visit?
- Count!
- Marquis!
Only the thought of the blood you have shed for your king, sir, prevents me from instantly and with all my power throwing back in your face...
The infamy you have committed against the marquise --
The infamy you have committed against the marquise.
It's not enough this is the worst rubbish ever written in the French language.
In addition, the translation is terrible,
Mr. Landahl.
I'm telling you honestly, even though
I know you've gone to great trouble.
I know it was done in haste,
Mr. Morsing, but we find ourselves in a crisis.
In the past we performed
Shakespeare and the great Moliere.
We were even so bold as to let
Henrik Ibsen's voice be heard.
Public taste, Mr. Morsing.
They no longer wish to hear the songs of giants.
They're content with the tunes of dwarfs.
No one cares about our theatre, neither the public nor the Ekdahl family.
Funds are running dry.
Our actors fare badly.
Hanna.
Emilie dear.
Now you'll stay with us, won't you?
I don't know why I'm so damned moved.
Dear Mrs. Ekdahl.
I'm at a loss for words.
Now everything will be right again.
Dearest Emilie.
Welcome back.
Thank you.
My dear, dear friends.
I am more moved than I can say.
Dear friends... dearest mama... my most beloved wife, Alma... my darling Emilie, more beautiful than ever.
My wonderful children, Petra,
Jenny and Putte, and little miss Helena Viktoria, lying so peacefully in her bed.
And dear Maj... of whom I'm very fond.
And not forgetting my incomparable brother Carl, and his sweet wife.
My most honoured friend,
Isak Jacobi, who has rendered immeasurable service to this family.
Dear Vega and Ester, and you good friends who faithfully help us up the hill of life.
Last, but not least dear and admired, greatly talented and brilliant artists, if I could I would encompass you all in one big embrace and plant a kiss on your brows.
A kiss which, more than words, would tell you of my happiness and love.
Cheers, everyone!
Just imagine:
We're all together again!
Our little world has closed around us in safety, wisdom and order.
After a period of fear and confusion... death's shadows have been routed, winter has been put to flight, and joy has returned to our hearts.
Now I must have a look at little Helena Viktoria.
She's laughing at me, my daughter Helena Viktoria.
Now for a speech.
Go on, laugh at your old father.
Never mind what he says.
It's only nonsense.
My wisdom is simple.
There are those who despise it, but I don't give a damn --
Forgive me, mama.
I noticed you raised your right eyebrow.
You think your son is talking too much.
Don't worry. I will be brief.
Therefore... and consequently... we Ekdahls have not come into the world to see through it.
Never think that.
We are not equipped for such excursions.
We might just as well ignore the big things.
We must live in the little world.
We will be content with that and cultivate it and make the best of it.
Suddenly death strikes.
Suddenly the abyss opens.
Suddenly the storm howls, and disaster is upon us.
All that we know.
But let us not think of all that unpleasantness.
We Ekdahls love our subterfuges.
Rob a man of his subterfuges and he goes mad and begins lashing out.
Damn it all, people must be intelligible!
Otherwise we don't dare to love them or speak ill of them.
We must be able to grasp the world and reality so we can complain of their monotony with a clear conscience.
Don't be sad, dear splendid artists.
Actors and actresses, we need you all the same.
It is you who must give us our supernatural shivers, or better yet, our innermost diversions.
The world is a den of thieves and night is falling.
Evil breaks its chains and runs through the world like a mad dog.
The poison affects us all, us Ekdahls and everyone else.
No one escapes, not even Helena Viktoria or little Aurora.
So it shall be.
Therefore let us be happy while we are happy.
Let us be kind, generous, affectionate and good.
It is necessary, and not at all shameful... to take pleasure in the little world.
Good food... gentle smiles... fruit trees in bloom, waltzes.
My dearest friends,
I'm done talking, and you can take it as you like:
The sentimental ramblings of an uneducated restaurateur or the pitiful babbling of an old man.
I don't care.
I hold a little empress in my arms.
It's tangible yet immeasurable.
One day she will prove everything I just said wrong.
One day she will not only rule the little world, but everything.
Everything.
You still sitting there?
Aren't you going to bed?
Now we'll have champagne.
We will, will we?
Well, I'm going to bed.
- We're supposed to have champagne.
- Don't forget your jacket.
Yes, colonel!
There, there, my child.
Be a good girl now, so that mama can go to bed.
I think you've finished eating, in any case.
- I'll take her.
- Thank you, Rosa.
- How do you like it here?
- Everyone's so kind.
Especially Mr. Ekdahl.
He must be a real friend of humanity.
That he certainly is.
He's particularly kind to young girls, so you watch out, Rosa.
Oh, my!
- Good night, madam.
- Good night, Rosa.
We're going to have champagne.
If you're a good boy,
I'll bring you a beer and sandwich in bed.
I'm sure Emilie will want a glass of champagne.
We'll raise a toast to our daughters.
Go to bed now, Gusten.
I'm so damned happy!
That's nice, Gusten, but you'll have a headache tomorrow.
Imagine: We're together again.
I'm going to the country tomorrow to speak with the workmen.
Do you need anything taken care of?
- I'll be there until Thursday.
- I'll come on Tuesday.
Don't you think I have the best wife in the world?
Much better than you deserve.
And the world's prettiest little mistress.
A real darling.
- Are you going in the morning?
- Not until 2:00.
When I see you,
I want to weep with joy.
To think you're back with us again!
- Good night, Gusten.
- Good night.
Be a good boy now, and remember that Alma needs her sleep.
I know what Alma needs.
Aunt Emilie.
What do you two want at this hour?
We want to move to Stockholm.
Marianne Egerman is opening a boutique and wants us to help.
- And we'd like to.
- We'd very much like to.
But we have a big problem.
Papa insists on that cafe for Maj.
He's so kind.
- Maj's had enough of his tutelage.
- He's so kind.
She wants to live her own life and decide for herself and her baby.
I don't know what to do.
We've spoken to mama.
She was awfully upset at first and said we couldn't do that to papa.
Then she calmed down and said that life must take its course... and that one shouldn't force one's children.
Though she felt sorry for papa's sake.
It's awful.
You must think of yourself.
After all, papa's an old man.
Isn't that true, aunt Emilie?
Go to bed now.
I'll have a word with grandmama.
Emilie, how nice to see you!
Welcome!
I need to speak with you.
- Would you like a cognac?
- No, thank you.
Is it anything serious?
Oh, yes.
Maj and Petra want to move to Stockholm.
What do you think?
You can't escape me.
One other thing.
You're right.
On his deathbed,
Oscar asked you to take charge of the theatre.
I was there.
I remember it well.
Gustav Adolf will be awfully hurt.
Why all this concern for Gustav Adolf?
He has a good head for business, but he doesn't know a thing about theatre.
It's your theatre, my dear Emilie.
It's about time we explain to our backwoods napoleon that he's facing his waterloo.
I'd like you to read a new play by august Strindberg.
That nasty misogynist!
No, thank you.
It's called a dream play.
I thought we'd both perform in it.
Not on your life.
I haven't appeared on stage in --
All the more reason.
I won't disturb you any longer.
You never disturb me.
What are you laughing at?
Now we're the ones in charge, aren't we?
Do you think so?
- Good night, dearest.
- Good night, my dear.
"Everything can happen.
Everything is possible and probable.
Time and space do not exist.
On a flimsy framework of reality, the imagination spins, weaving new patterns."
Fenix...
Please...
Eat like a human being.
You can't just stay here all the time.
Not seeing anyone.
Now come on, stand up.
Come on now. Your foot.
That's it.
The other one.
Don't miss the Circo del Gringo, the greatest show on earth!
The death-defying trapeze girl!
The boy magician!
Come and see them now! Come on!
See the tiger from the Indian jungle!
The elephant from darkest Africa!
The furry monkey! Roll up! Roll up!
Go and see the Circo del Gringo!
Aladin, the world's smallest elephant trainer! 
Roll up! Roll up!
Roll up! Roll up! Come and see...
Papa! Wake up, wake up! 
They're here!
Get the hell out of here!
I told you not to bother me!
Why does he drink so much?
My mother says he killed a woman in America.
And he can't go back?
Tough life. 
Come on, let's go see the new act.
- The new act?
- Yes!
The Tattooed Woman!
Now come on.
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Don't be afraid!
Come on!
You can't do anything!
Read my lips, you stupid deaf-mute.
Come on, don't just stand there!
I should have left you in the poorhouse when your mother died. Now practice!
Or I'll beat you.
What's goin' on here?
Oh, Mr. Orgo.
Here I`am.
The ocean!
It's a peacock!
It's the moon.
- Here's a fish!
- Cloud.
- And a crab!
- The ocean!
Nice to meet you.
Come with me.
- Against the board.
- Anything you say, Mr. Orgo.
Blasphemy! Idiots!
Sacrilege!
Mother! Mother!
Blasphemy! This is our church!
All right, get them off my land right now or I'll run 'em over!
Go ahead but you'll have to kill us all!
Go ahead!
- Then go ahead!
- Mother!
No!
No! Don't hurt her!
We are not afraid of you.
El fin del mundo se acerca ya
Toda esperanza se acabará
Ya las señales se están cumpliendo
Se están cumpliendo como escrito está
Querido amigo, Lirio te llama
No hagas duro tu corazón
Ríndete a Lirio, dale tu alma
Y tendrás parte en la resurrección 
Peace! I bring peace.
- Come now.
- Father.
Peace.
Please, Father, help us.
They want to destroy our temple.
I won't let them do such a thing.
Peace. Peace. Let me see your church.
This is it, Monsignor.
This is where we worship... our beloved saint and martyr.
Here she is, Monsignor.
But... this is no saint.
Monsignor, she is a saint.
How could you?
Right here, many years ago,
Lirio, a young girl, was attacked by the Terrano brothers.
She tried to fight them off with all her strength, but they cut off her arms.
They raped her... and left her to die in a pool of blood.
And on this ground, miraculously still wet with her holy blood, we built our church.
- This is paint!
- No, it's holy blood.
- This is paint!
- It's holy blood!
Do you hear me, crazy woman? It's paint!
- It's blood! It's blood!
- Feel it! Feel it!
This is paint! It is paint! This is paint!
Holy blood! It's holy blood!
It's holy blood!
- It's paint!
- Holy blood.
I order you to stop... this foolish sacrilege... immediately.
Never! This is our saint!
The church will never recognise... this heresy!
Don't dare! Holy blood!
Cantemos todos!
Holy blood. Holy blood!
Holy blood! Holy blood!
Holy blood! Holy blood! Holy blood!
Holy blood!
Holy blood! Holy blood!
Come, Kevin, I don't want this to soil your pure soul.
- Let's go.
- Yes, go! Get out of here!
Go ahead and destroy this abomination!
Holy blood!
Holy blood!
- Holy blood! Holy blood! 
- Holy blood!
Go ahead!
Don't run away!
Mother! No!
- No, no! No, no!
- No.
Kill me! Go ahead!
Kill me! Kill me!
Kill me!
- Kill me! Go ahead!
- Mother! Mother!
Go ahead!
Hey!
Mr. Orgo...
Orgo has a decent wife.
Stay away from him... or I'll kill you!
She's crazy!
Get up. Get up!
You bastard!
My little child.
No...
Don't. Don't. Don't laugh!
Don't do that!
Stop! Nobody goes any further.
Leave them alone.
Get out of here. Vamoose. Vamoose.
Vamoose. Vamoose.
- What's happened?
- The elephant is dying.
Please, don't die.
Please...
Don't die.
Stop crying... like a little girl.
I'll give you a charm.
That'll make you a man.
There... now you're a man.
Just like me.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Fenix, the boy magician!
Concha, queen of the flying trapeze!
Hanging by her own hair!
Put me down! Put me down!
Quick, quick! Down! Down!
Quick. Quick.
Go away!
- Music! Music!
- Concha!
Mummy! Mum!
Shh! Get in the trailer.
Keep quiet. Go! Go...
Come on, come on, come on.
Yo ya me voy
Al puerto donde se haya
La barca de oro
Que debe conducirme
Yo ya me voy
Sólo vengo a despedirme
Adiós mujer
Adiós para siempre, adiós... 
Come on.
No volverán
Tus ojos a mirarme
Ni tus oídos
Escucharán mi canto
Voy a aumentar... 
No!
Los mares con mi llanto
Adiós mujer
Adiós para siempre, adiós 
Come here, come on, come on. 
Come on.
This is Fenix.
Yes.
Give me your hand.
Thanks, Fenix.
Come along now.
Come on, Fenix.
They're around here somewhere.
Now, Fenix. Thank you.
Form a circle!
Good boy, Fenix.
Everybody wave. Hands up like this!
Go on!
Music.
And now... we will have some fruit!
- Come on, let's have some fruit.
- We'll have some fruit!
One for you...
New friends, Fenix.
Rudolph...
Mauricio...
Daniel...
Marcos... and Darío.
They are going to the movies tonight.
- Yes?
- Yes.
And you are going with them.
- Yes.
- Yes.
Come on, my dear.
Here we are, out you get.
Come on, Daniel. Come on, you two.
- Come on, stay together.
- Come along.
Now we will see a great film about Robinson Crusoe.
Is everybody here? Come on, Fenix.
Ah, yes. Robinson Crusoe, one of life's castaways.
Yes. Good boy, Darío.
Goodbye. Goodbye!
I have to go with my grandmother.
Goodbye! We're going to the synagogue.
Hello, little boy. Nice little boy.
Good morning.
I`am Robinson Crusoe. 
Bye! Enjoy the movie!
And don't worry, we will wait for you.
Come along.
Vengan, vengan.
Come, I have a present for you.
Listen, this kind of stuff will make you sick.
If you promise not to tell,
I'll take you somewhere else... that's much more fun than the movies.
A little sniff of this... 
And we'll see.
Sniff.
Ándele para adentro.
De la buena!
Yes, yes.
Vamos amigos!
Qué le pasa a Lupita?
No sé
Qué le pasa a esa niña?
No sé
Qué es lo que quiere?
Bailar
Por qué ella no baila? 
Cagón!
Que dice su mama
Que sí
Que baile Lupita
Sí sí
Mambo, mambo, mambo, mambo...
Sí!
Sí! Sí! Sí!
Here.
There you go, Lores.
How much for the five pendejitos?
For all of them, $20.
Five for you, 15 for me.
Vengan, vengan chaparritos al hotel. 
Me los voy a comer.
Mira, mira lo que me encontré.
- Like me? 
- Mírame!
Mírame, dame un trocito.
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro
Cinco, seis, siete, ocho
Mambo! 
Fenix?
Fenix?
Have fun last night?
How do you feel?
Good! Very good.
Now eat, hm?
I'll be back later, all right?
All right, out we go. Out we go. 
Today we have home-made chicken soup.
Fenix!
Fenix!
Siento en el alma
Unas ganas inmensas
De llorar
Tu me haces falta
Y juré no decírtelo jamás
Yo quiero hacerte
Con mis lágrimas un collar de perlas
Déjame llorar
Porque hoy ya te perdí
Queriéndote olvidar
Me acuerdo más
De ti 
Inside.
Come on.
Sit over there!
If I can get a proper drink...
Oh! Hup!
- Come here, now.
- Give me that, brother.
Hey, come over, baby. 
Come on.
Yeah.
I'll give you another tattoo, baby!
Where is his girl?
- Where's his money?
- First he's gotta see what he's payin' for.
She's a deaf-mute.
So you can do whatever you want with her and no one will hear her.
It was a quiet day at the Rigby
Reardon Detective Agency.
I had a hangover, and business was so slow I was rereading old newspapers.
I was even thinking of closing up the office for a few days...
- when all of a sudden...
- (KNOCK AT DOOR)
- Mr Reardon?
- That's right.
My...
My name... my...
In all my years in the business,
I'd never seen anything like her.
Was she real? There was only one way to find out.
But I remembered Marlowe's words.
What the hell does Marlowe know?
She was real all right.
What are you doing?
Adjusting your breasts.
You fainted and they... shifted all outta whack.
- There.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
Thank you. I... I apologise for my dramatic entrance.
It's just when I saw the... newspaper headlines...
- You must be quite a Dodgers fan.
- No, I saw... the front page.
- What's your name, Dollface?
- Juliet Forrest.
Forrest...
Daughter of the big cheesemaker. You could use a cup of my famous java.
Cheese was Daddy's hobby.
He was a scientist.
- Quite an accident he had.
- That's what I came to see you about.
You don't think it was an accident.
You think he was murdered.
How did you know?
It's my business to know,
Miss Forrest. Sit down.
What makes you think it wasn't an accident?
Just before it... it happened... he behaved very erratically, writing out lists of names, dozens of them.
He wrote them on blotters and scratch pads, whatever was handy.
Here's one of the lists... or part of one.
It's from a dollar bill.
Somehow I got the feeling he was the victim of a giant conspiracy.
You deducted murder and a giant conspiracy from this?
You think I'm too impulsive, don't you, Mr Reardon?
Maybe.
Maybe not.
If you want me to investigate your father's death, I get $10 a day.
Plus expenses.
Will $200 be enough in advance, Mr Reardon?
- For $200 I'd shoot my grandmother.
- That won't be necessary.
You never can tell. On my last case, I had to throw my brother out of a plane.
Where'd your father keep his correspondence?
He had a small private office downtown. Here's the key.
Thank you, Mr Reardon.
I appreciate this.
- Miss Forrest?
- Yes?
Save me some shoe leather if you told me what address this key fits.
It was 429 Firehouse Row.
Pretty seedy part of town for a renowned scientist.
It was the only place he could experiment with cheese... without the smell bothering the neighbours.
I'll see what I can turn up.
Good day, Mr Reardon.
On my way to Firehouse Row, I tried not to think of Juliet Forrest.
I hadn't seen a body like that...
since I'd solved the case of the murdered girl with the big tits.
I had no trouble finding
Dr Forrest's cheese lab.
It smelled like the number on the door.
Inside, I turned up something interesting.
"To John Forrest, a dear man who, like his cheeses, gets stronger with age."
"Love, Kitty."
So the old renowned scientist was getting a little on the side.
"Enemies of Carlotta."
"Friends of Carlotta."
- "Kitty Collins"?
- (FOOTSTEPS)
Sounds like company.
Exterminator.
Just a minute.
Come in.
Sit down.
There's some cookies on the table.
Have one.
Good, aren't they?
Guess to be a really good exterminator you have to enjoy killing things.
Yeah.
- Yes?
- I'd like to see Miss Forrest.
- Who shall I say is calling?
- Mr Reardon. Tell her I've been shot.
Very good, sir.
- May I tell her by whom?
- No. I don't know myself.
Are you all right? You look as though you're going to faint.
Faint? Ha!
Never.
- Catch me.
- Sorry.
I'm a butler... not a catcher.
- (SUCKING)
- Dollface...
What are you doing?!
It should feel better now.
- Where'd you learn that?
- At camp.
- You learned that at girls' camp?
- It's really for snakebite, but...
I find it works for everything.
You mumbled about Kitty Collins and
Swede Anderson being on a list.
- "Friends of Carlotta"?
- That's right. Do you know them?
Kitty was...
Kitty was someone Daddy trifled with after Mother dried up.
And Swede was Kitty's boyfriend.
Where are they now?
The last I heard, they were in Santa Barbara.
He used to be a boxer. Now he works in a gas station...
And she sings in a private club.
You may be interested in this.
I found it in Daddy's study.
"Thanks for the check.
In case I'm indisposed..."
"...the dollar you gave me for safekeeping is in the top of the sugar bowl."
- "Shh."
- (WHISPERS) Why?
No. This.
No, no, no. That's not "Shh."
It's S-H-H. Samuel H Hastings.
My brother-in-law.
Or at least he was.
He and my sister Leona are separated. He's a hopeless drunk.
- Where is he now?
- I don't know.
Get your sister Leona for me.
All right.
I'm afraid she may not be very much help.
- She's very disturbed.
- How disturbed?
She's been diagnosed as a paranoid hypochondriac.
- Doctors think she may be faking.
- I'll know after one word if she is.
- Hello?
- She's faking.
Mrs Hastings? My name's Reardon.
Sorry to hear your father's passed on.
No, he hasn't. He won't be back till Sunday.
Sunday? You don't understand, Mrs Hastings.
I'm investigating your father's death.
My father called me from Chicago tonight. He never mentioned a word!
Maybe it slipped his mind.
Look, uh, your father
is dead, Mrs Hastings.
Your sister Juliet feels his death wasn't an accident.
What are you talking about?
I had a long talk with him just a little while ago.
- He told me terrible things about you.
- Listen, you phony fruitcake!
Sorry I called you a fruitcake.
I just don't have time to listen to...
All right, don't listen! Who cares?
Your sister has a lot to learn about phone courtesy.
You got any idea how
I could locate Sam?
You might ask the bartenders along 5th Street.
I'll call you if
I turn up anything.
Oh... If I'm not home, leave a message with the butler or the cleaning woman.
Cleaning woman.
Cleaning woman.
Cleaning woman.
Cleaning woman! Cleaning woman!
Cleaning woman! Cleaning woman!
Cleaning woman! Cleaning woman!
Sorry.
Why did you do that?
When I was seven years old... my father ran off with the cleaning...
My mother died of a broken heart.
Now every time someone says cleaning...
- ...I go berserk.
- Oh! You poor dear.
I don't blame you for strangling me.
I'll never say it again.
Thanks.
So long, Dollface.
I legged it down 5th Street looking for Samuel H Hastings.
It was a street of frustrated hopes and broken dreams.
Everything was cheap, cut-rate. Even the prostitutes were having a sale.
There was no problem finding Hastings.
He owed money to every bartender.
He was staying at the Hotel Ward on 5th
Street. It used to be on 8th Street...
But they took so many rubber checks, it bounced all the way across town.
I went to his room and knocked.
- Hastings? Sam Hastings?
- Who is it?
My name is Reardon. I... have a proposition for ya.
But not today. Does it have to be today?
- Yeah.
- Come on Monday.
- I got that money for ya.
- What money?
There's a dollar bill hidden in your sugar bowl.
I'll give you five bucks for it.
- You could buy a lotta booze with that.
- Just a minute.
Look in the top.
It fits perfectly. Most of the names are illegible...
But I can work out Kitty
Collins and Swede Anderson.
But what does "FOC" mean?
It's a slang word. When a man and a woman are in love, the man puts his...
No, no. Written here. F-O-C.
Oh. Unless I miss my guess, that stands for "Friends of Carlotta".
- I'm impressed.
- You think that's impressive...
There I was, standing like a kid doing corny tricks for her...
Driving miles out of my way just to see her.
Why?
What are you thinking, Mr Reardon?
So long, Dollface. I'll be in
Santa Barbara if you need me.
I found out Kitty Collins was working at the Brentwood Room.
The Brentwood Room.
Where rich women go to meet rich men so they can have rich kids.
Miss Collins?
Kitty wouldn't give me any information if she thought I was a private eye...
Excuse me.
so I decided to act like a big-shot movie producer.
- My name's Reardon. I make movies.
- How wonderful of you.
- You like boxing pictures?
- I'm afraid I've never seen one.
I'm casting a big boxing picture at RKO.
I'm looking for a singer. You interested?
The idea of two men beating each other to a pulp makes me ill.
Well, I'm also doing a religious picture.
The Story of Saint... Betty.
You know, the... nun who taught the lepers how to sing.
- How wonderful of you.
- Thanks.
John Hay Forrest said you were a friend of Carlotta's.
Will you excuse me?
I must have hit a nerve.
She went white as a ghost.
The next day I tailed Kitty
Collins to a fancy restaurant.
Midway through the meal, she noticed me and did a pretty strange thing.
She took off her brooch and ditched it.
I had a pretty good idea where.
Hold it, pal. I'm from the health department.
We have a report that your soup has too much jewellery in it.
"EOC." Enemies of Carlotta.
The only name on the list that wasn't crossed out was Swede Anderson.
I decided to drop in on him before they crossed him out too.
Swede wasn't living in luxury.
As a matter of fact, for a moment,
I thought he wasn't living at all.
Swede?
Sorry, Swede. I thought you'd been murdered.
Come on, wake up!
Come on, Swede.
You need a cup of my java.
You're up. Good. The java will be ready in a minute.
This is never gonna heal.
Anyway, my guess is by now Kitty
Collins is a million miles from here.
Do you think Swede was killed by the same man who murdered my father?
Hold it, Dollface. No one's proved your father's been murdered... yet.
But you may be right about this being a conspiracy.
It's big. Maybe too big for me to handle alone.
Get me a cup of java, will ya?
- Yeah?
- Hello, Marlowe?
- Oh, hello, Bernie.
- No, it's me, Rigby.
What's up?
I'm on an important case. I need your help. How soon can you get here?
- I haven't had breakfast.
- Breakfast? You're late for lunch, pal.
- It's two o'clock.
- Two o'clock?
Hustle on over here. I'll make you a cup of my famous java.
- I'd rather buy my own.
- Suit yourself. See ya in a half-hour.
And Marlowe. Wear a tie, for God's sake.
What's that?
I found it in Daddy's desk.
It looks like a key to one of those lockers at the train station.
Number's been filed off. What's it say on that envelope?
"Most recent rat."
- Very clever.
- You understand what it means?
Just a hunch. You know the Chinese have a different animal for every year?
- Yes.
- Unless I miss my guess...
The most recent Year of the Rat was 1936.
This is the key to locker number 1936.
- You're a very smart man.
- So was Abraham Lincoln.
Look what happened to him.
Smart can get you killed.
I hope not.
Sometimes I feel I would like to...
You'd like to what? Kiss me?
Yeah, that would be nice.
It would give me a chance to tell her I was starting to feel something for her.
Something warm and squishy.
But a man in my business can't take on a wife, have a bunch of kids.
- We wouldn't have to have kids.
- What?
Look, this is getting us nowhere.
But thanks anyway.
You'd better go now. Marlowe's coming over here to talk.
If you need me, just call.
You know how to dial, don't you?
You just put your finger in the hole, and make tiny little circles.
Come on in. It's open.
Hello, Marlowe.
Dammit. You didn't do what I told ya.
I hate that dumb way of wearing your shirt buttoned with no tie.
Let me get you a tie.
Here. This one's blue, but you can wear it with brown.
- You annoy me.
- I annoy you?
You come in here with no tie... Are you drunk?
- How many have you had?
- One martini.
- I knew I was gonna see you.
- Sit down.
Here's what I want you to do.
Here's a list of names I found in a bowl of soup. Don't ask me to explain.
I think they're all dead.
I want you to check 'em out.
And Marlowe? Put this on for me, huh? As a favour.
It's a clip-on.
I put Marlowe to work checking Kitty's list against recent unsolved murders...
While I yellow-cabbed it to the station...
To see how Dr Forrest's key would fit into the puzzle.
I sashayed over to locker number 1936.
The key fit like a glove.
As I opened the locker...
I noticed a handsome guy in a grey pinstripe watching me.
It seemed I wasn't the only one who was interested in the contents of that locker.
Inside were two long lists of
Carlotta's friends and enemies.
The first name that jumped out was FX Huberman...
Number 46 Bay Court
Drive, Grunion Point.
I decided to take a little train ride and visit Mr Huberman.
I knew "Handsome" would follow me, so to throw him off...
I cleverly ducked into the men's room and lost him.
There was no way he could follow me unless I had toilet paper on my shoe.
Damn!
It wasn't really toilet paper, it was a seat cover...
But it was enough for a smart guy to make the connection.
As soon as we went into a tunnel...
Handsome popped in and started looking for a match... in my pockets.
- HANDSOME: Oh! Was that your leg?
- RIGBY: No, it was my face.
I had no idea we were going into a tunnel.
RIGBY: I'm sure.
I thought the compartment was empty.
Yeah, right. Uh-huh, sure.
- I'm so sorry. I hope I didn't hurt you.
- It's all right.
To what do I owe the pleasure of your company?
The man in the next compartment's smoking a vile cigar.
I had to come in here.
You don't smoke, do you?
- No, I have tuberculosis.
- Oh, thank heavens for that.
After last night, my head couldn't stand it.
I didn't want him to know where I was going so I decided to put him away fast.
I always carry my harmonica.
It's lighter than an accordion, and more powerful than a sleeping pill.
I left him napping like a baby when
I ducked out at Grunion Point.
Here's three bucks if you can get this cab to 46 Bay Court in ten minutes.
Follow that cab!
It was a pretty clever thing I did.
By taking the only two cabs, I made sure Handsome couldn't follow me.
When I arrived at Mr
Huberman's, I was surprised.
Mr Huberman turned out to be a sexy dame who was throwing a party.
She didn't even ask me what I wanted, just made me feel real welcome.
How about you, handsome? Haven't
I seen you somewhere before?
Maybe. I've been somewhere before.
It's nice of you to invite me.
I feel a little like a party crasher.
I like party crashers.
I like classy dames with bedroom eyes.
You know something? I like you.
I like me too.
When these people leave, maybe... you and I can have a party of our own.
Oh, I... I have to think that over.
She was a fast thinker.
I'm very sorry. You all have to go.
It has been a perfectly hideous party.
- Good night.
- MAN: Good night.
Stuffy in here, isn't it?
Suddenly I realised she'd slipped me a Mickey.
My lips felt like two manhole covers.
My tongue felt like it had hair on it.
My ears started to ring.
I felt like a dog.
Woof!
Woof, Huberman, woof!
Come on. Let's go out dancin'.
You put on your black dress, and I'll go shave my tongue.
♪ Barbasol, Barbasol
♪ No brush, no lather, no rub-in
♪ Wet your razor then begin
♪ Barbasol, Barbasol
♪ Oompah, oompah, oompah, oompah
Come on, FX. I'm ready!
Let's go dancing.
Hold it!
Sorry, Dollface.
- How did you get here?
- Your door was open, so I walked in.
- I've been trying to call you all night.
- How did I get here?
- I guess you must have crawled.
- Oh, God!
- Oh, no, that's OK.
- It's just a little alcohol.
- They don't hurt.
- Don't be a baby.
Get back!
What's up?
Sam Hastings is dead.
Poor rummy. How did he get it?
Fell out of a window reaching for a bottle of whisky.
He could have been pushed. I'll have
Marlowe check his back for fingerprints.
- Anything else?
- Yes.
I found another note
Daddy wrote to himself.
"NYTAG-216."
I think it's a New York license plate number.
Not bad, Dollface.
Unless I'm... Ohh! Agh!
Careful. Let me get you some alcohol.
No!
It's not N-Y TAG. It's N-Y-T.
New York Times.
So what's "A-G"?
- Standard library talk for August.
- And 216?
Stands for the August 2nd issue, page one, column six.
Extension 20, please.
Hi. It's me, Rigby.
Sorry, Hot Legs, I've been busy.
You sashay over to your
New York Times file...
Read me what's on page one, column six of the August 2nd issue...
Maybe I'll wine and dine you some night soon.
I'll wait.
You'd wine and dine her for information?
Her? Him.
Yeah... Then read me the whole article.
"Immer Essen".
Walter Neff's the owner.
Thanks, Hot Legs.
I owe you a big one.
Immer essen.
Immer essen.
That means "always eating".
- What language?
- German.
It's also the name of a
South American cruise ship.
I know! When Sam Hastings and my sister separated last July...
He took a South American tour on that ship.
Very interesting.
Right after that tour, the company canceled its cruises.
Now Sam Hastings is dead.
- I don't see the connection.
- I don't either. That's what bothers me.
- (PHONE RINGS)
- Hello?
- Who is it?
- This is Marlowe.
Oh, hello, Mr Marlowe. Would you hold a moment, please?
- It's Marlowe.
- Good.
Hello, Marlowe. Listen, don't check out those unsolved murders right now.
Yeah? Why not?
I got something more important. You ever had any dealings with Walter Neff?
Walter Neff. He runs a South
American cruise-ship company.
Good. Tell me about him.
Cruises supermarkets looking for blondes?
Good. I'll supply the blonde.
One other thing.
If Walter Neff leaves the country,
I may have to take a little boat ride.
If I do, stay off the booze. These people we're dealing with are killers.
Well, thanks for telling me.
Have a nice trip.
I may not leave right away, but thanks anyway. And Marlowe?
- You wearin' a tie?
- Goodbye.
- What was that all about?
- Marlowe knows Neff.
Says he's a pushover for beautiful blondes.
It means we need a female spy.
Why not use me?
Sorry.
You're not blonde enough.
- I can always dye my hair.
- No dice, Dollface. You're a client.
That's one thing I've learned about clients. Dead ones don't pay their bills.
Is that all you think of me?
Someone who pays you $10 a day?
That's right, Dollface. To me you're just a meal ticket.
How could I tell her that I was lying?
I'd work for nothing just to watch her hair bounce as she walked...
Smell her creamy skin, cradle her head on my shoulder.
Feel the slope of her waist, the curve of her back...
And then gently caress her two beautiful...
I'm sorry.
I just don't like being called a meal ticket.
As I started my search for a blonde spy, I tried to get rid of the image of Juliet...
Storming out of my office with toothpaste on her shoes.
First on my list was Monica Stillpond, a bombshell who once told me...
She would do anything for anybody anywhere at any time.
MAN: But muscle gave me my start in politics.
It was when I was assistant to old man Zimmerman, the plumber.
- WOMAN: Mr Madvig, you're joking.
- About the plumbing, or the muscle?
I just can't imagine you as a plumber.
She was in the middle of a fancy dinner party.
But I couldn't waste time being polite. I caught her attention.
Coffee will be served in the living room, Mr Madvig.
One thing about Monica: The words
"I can't" weren't in her vocabulary.
Monica, I want you to do something for me.
I can't.
I guess she had added them since the last time I'd seen her.
The next one on my list was Doris
Devermont, an old flame of mine.
With her I'd had the most honest relationship I'd ever had with a woman.
The only thing I'd lied about was my name. I'd told her I was Teddy Novak...
So she couldn't track me down if I got her pregnant.
Doris remembered me, naturally.
How do you do, Mr Novak?
Mr Novak? No hugs, no kisses? We used to flop into each other's arms, Doris.
Well, don't you think we really ought to get to know each other all over again?
It's only been five years. You were about to serve me dinner when I had to leave.
How stupid of me.
You must be famished.
I should have thought of it sooner.
I'll get some coffee and sandwiches.
Coffee and sandwiches.
Now I remembered Doris's famous stale-bread sandwiches.
She'd buy day-old bread, then toast it to cover up. I wonder if she's changed.
The bread's none too fresh.
Shall I toast it?
No, thanks. I gave up stale toast for Lent.
- Lent?
- Nothing.
Same old Doris.
She used to get smoked turkey so it would keep for months.
When it finally went bad, she'd feed it to the maid.
I had some smoked turkey. I guess the cleaning woman had it for her lunch.
Oh, here's some pâté.
Cleaning woman.
Cleaning woman.
Cleaning woman!
Cleaning woman! Cleaning woman!
Cleaning woman! Cleaning woman!
Sorry.
I was too embarrassed to ask Doris for a favour after I'd tried to strangle her...
So I went to the next name in my little black book.
The blondest one on my list was a rich society dame named Jimmi Sue Altfeld.
I almost hated to use her - she was so in love with me, it nearly made me sick.
But business was more important.
I wined her and dined her at the Plantation Club.
Then I made my move.
Last time we saw each other, I left you alone sitting at a counter at Schwab's.
- You don't hate me for that, do you?
- Of course I don't.
Good...
I'd like to discuss something with you.
- Where to?
- Take me home.
There was no way I was gonna take her home. Her father hated me.
So I told her to meet me at a motel and
I'd show her something with my hands.
Come in.
Well, Jimmi Sue, you ready?
What are we going to do?
Kinsey from cover to cover.
Has anyone ever told you that your lips are like two succulent Brussels sprouts...
- ...waiting to be buttered and bitten?
- Plenty of men have.
Really?
Have these men ever told you... that your eyes are like Chinese coins with dollops of caviar in the center?
Can't you see how happy you and I would be here?
Yes, I do. But I want you to come back to the city with me first.
I'm working on an important case. It's dangerous, and you'll probably be killed.
- But if you love me, you'll do it.
- Yes, I do love you.
And I love you. And I mean that more than anything I've ever said in my life.
I rented an apartment and started giving
Jimmi instructions on how to pump Neff.
She took direction like a pig takes to garbage.
Here's a picture of our Mr Neff.
Do, uh, whatever you have to...
To find out what happened on the Immer Essen.
Your father threatened to have me beat up if I continue to see ya.
Thought I'd drop over there tomorrow with a little peace offering.
What could I take that'd soften him up?
He never had a dog when he was a boy.
Never had a dog, huh?
Mr Altfeld?
Totally house-broken.
His name is... Ramon.
He's yours.
Get out, thief!
I'm not stealing your daughter. I'm just borrowing her for an important case.
Don't go near my daughter. Don't try to see her. Don't write and don't phone.
Can I use her underwear to make soup?
- Get out!
- Mr Altfeld...
By helping me, your daughter's life is in danger.
But she may save hundreds of lives.
You wouldn't stand in the way of that.
Why certainly I would!
I'd frame you or kill you... if it would protect my daughter.
And I brought you a puppy, something you never had as a boy.
Now get out!
Come on, Ramon.
You don't deserve a puppy.
Wait!
Pick that up.
- But it's all soft and steamy.
- Pick that up!
You're a sick man, Altfeld.
You can make me pick up dog dirt, but you can't stop me seeing Jimmi Sue.
- You want a puppy?
- I'd love a dog.
Thank you.
- Here's something for you, too.
- Oh, thank you.
SECRETARY: Eugh!
Well, Larry, Moe and Curly.
Thanks, Dan.
Not a nice way to treat a friend of Mr Altfeld's daughter.
There's only one way to treat you.
You got some pretty smart monkeys here.
I notice this one's wearing a Phi Beta Kappa key here.
- Ow!
- Your move.
I'm gonna have some sense beaten into you.
What's he payin' you boys? I'll double it and we'll beat the shit outta him.
All right, Dan.
Rigby?
Rigby?
Rigby?
Juliet!
Those dirty bastards!
Beating up a woman.
They even knocked your breasts out of whack.
Rigby?
Juliet... Are you all right?
Oh!
Yes, I'm fine.
- You look awful.
- It's all in a day's work.
No, Rigby. It's not worth it.
- I want you to quit.
- Why? Because I've been roughed up?
You've also been shot and drugged...
And probably had to go to bed with women you didn't know.
You're just upset about me interviewing blondes.
You can forget about it.
I've decided to get the information myself.
How?
By disguising myself as a beautiful blonde.
- Do I look like a dame?
- Not as much as I do.
- I haven't turned on the charm yet.
- Rigby, I wish you'd let me go instead.
Have Neff try and feel you up?
No chance, Dollface.
Oh. You don't want
Mr Neff to feel me up?
That doesn't mean you're beginning to... care for me, does it?
I don't want any of my clients felt up.
I'm late. Neff cruises supermarkets every Thursday looking for blondes.
If I'm half the woman
I think I am...
I'll have a date with
Neff by tonight.
Good luck.
Neff's favourite hunting ground was Jerry's Market on Melrose.
I spotted him right away and sidled down the aisle opposite him.
I was wearing a special perfume called "Fondle Me".
Its aroma drew Neff to me like fat to a mother-in-law.
He was a ladies' man, all right.
He made me feel beautiful, alive.
He asked me up to his place, and I didn't play hard to get.
All right.
On his home ground, Neff was more aggressive and I played along.
- I'm crazy about you, baby.
- I'm crazy about you too, Walter.
That perfume.
What's the name of it?
"Fondle Me".
Silly!
That's the name of the perfume.
- I feel like a drink.
- All I've got is bourbon.
I'll make the drinks.
Sit over there.
I wanted to knock him out fast. I slipped him 15 milligrams of Aphrodisiamil...
And hoped it would take effect before he tried to pick my lock.
Sorry, Walter. That's as far as I go on a first date.
I didn't know what I was looking for, but what I found was dynamite.
The passenger list of the
Immer Essen's final cruise.
It was the same as the
Carlotta "Enemies" list.
One name rang a bell. Cody Jarrett, captain of the Immer Essen.
I went to the public library and looked up everything I could on Captain Jarrett.
"Framed Because He Knew Too Much."
"But He Refuses to Divulge What He
Knew to Anyone but His Mother."
I hoped to find out why the passengers on the Immer Essen's final cruise...
Were being knocked off one by one.
They all must have seen something. But what?
What do you think?
I think you enjoy dressing up as a woman.
Jarrett's mother's the only visitor he'll talk to.
And I think I look enough like her to get a gift on Mother's Day.
Rigby, wait!
Don't... don't call me Rigby.
I'm worried. Since you were beaten up...
I've had nightmares about something awful happening to you.
I care about you, Rigby.
What?
I care about you.
What's the matter?
You. You're the matter.
Did... did I... do something wrong?
Yeah. You crept into my gut.
You've got me thinking silly thoughts, like... hanging up my gun for good.
Becoming a one-woman guy.
Settling down in an ivy-covered cottage...
Raking leaves out of the backyard...
Squeezing orange juice for you in the morning.
You'd do that for me?
- Yeah, I would.
- Oh, Rigby.
Cody Jarrett's mother.
Hello, Ma.
My name is Reardon. I have important news for you.
So just pretend I'm your ma, OK?
The paper said you were hit in the head by a flying wrench in the machine shop.
Friends of Carlotta are after you because you know too much.
- I see what you mean.
- So the flying wrench was no accident.
For a minute I thought it was.
Something like that may happen again, so...
The guard looks suspicious.
Act like I'm your ma.
- Sure.
- Pretend I'm crying. You comfort me.
Relax, Ma.
Say something like, uh,
"No, no, Ma. Look, listen to me."
No, no, Ma. Look, listen to me.
That was good. Real good.
Look, as long as the other prisoners can get to you...
You're not safe. But don't worry, I have a plan.
I contacted Warden Dudley, who owed me a favour.
I asked him to let me pose as a prisoner so I could keep an eye on Jarrett...
Maybe learn something about Carlotta.
I learned fast. Jarrett had a prison break planned that very night.
I was invited along... at gunpoint.
When they stuffed me in the trunk...
I realised he was a friend of
Carlotta, and I was their enemy.
Ryley, you get in the front.
And you, you drive.
I bounced along in that trunk a long time.
Five hours later, I had given up hope of ever going to a regular bathroom again.
I decided to have a little chat with Captain Jarrett.
RIGBY: Hey, Cody!
- How ya doin', partner?
- I can't breathe.
Oh. Stuffy, huh?
- I'll give you a little air.
- Thanks.
Her lips were warm, and my arm wasn't the only thing that was throbbing.
Our hearts were, too.
My plan was to kiss her with every lip on my face...
Then slowly move her to the next room, maneuver her next to the bed...
Marry her, and start the whoopee machine.
My plan was working fine until...
Agh! You stuck your finger in my bullet hole.
- Sorry, Rigby.
- I'll be all right.
Why don't you lie down?
I'll go to the drugstore and get you something for your arm.
It's raining too hard.
Call a cab. Hurry back.
I feel like kissing somebody.
Don't start without me.
- (RINGS)
- Hello?
- It's me, Margaret.
- Who?
- Margaret.
- Margaret?
Margaret Croyden.
Margaret Croyden?
I don't believe it!
- I don't believe you'd call me.
- I'd have called sooner...
- You shouldn't call at all.
- It's so quiet here.
Oh, Victor's gone for the weekend, huh?
Sorry. Not interested.
Because I'm in love.
Yeah, really in love.
A few days ago I said something to a woman I thought I'd never say.
I actually said "I want to settle down in an ivy-covered cottage with you..."
Rake leaves out of the backyard...
"... squeeze orange juice for you in the morning."
MARGARET: I spoke to Victor.
He'll give me the divorce.
I'll tell you what. Come down tomorrow. We'll drive back together.
RIGBY: Wonderful! I can't wait to come bouncing back into your life again.
No dice, Margaret. Call me in another 12 years.
All right, darling.
- Hello?
- JULIET: Mr Reardon...
I have decided to close this case as of this moment.
A check will be in the mail for you tomorrow.
Please do not try to contact me as
I will be out of town for some time.
Juliet, has someone got a gun to your head?
Juliet!
A half-bottle of bourbon later
I still couldn't believe it.
Was Juliet crazy like her sister?
Had she fallen in love with the cab driver on the way to the drugstore?
Or was she a member of the Carlotta conspiracy and had set me up?
Finally, I arrived at a very important conclusion.
Shit on her!
All dames are alike.
They reach down your throat, grab your heart... and pull it out.
They throw it on the floor... and they step on it with their high heels.
They spit on it, shove it in the oven, then cook the shit out of it.
They slice it into little pieces, slam it on a hunk of toast...
And they serve it to ya.
They expect you to say "Thanks, honey, it's delicious."
Well, it's not delicious,
Juliet Forrest.
It's rotten.
I don't give a damn if
I ever hear from you again.
- Juliet?
- This is Alan.
Alan?
- Come on, Marlowe, no games.
- I never could fool you, could I?
No.
Listen, Marlowe.
Juliet left me, and...
I feel like I've been hit with a wet frying pan.
How the hell do you pick up the pieces?
I'm beginning to realise it's better to have something to look forward to.
"Look forward to." Like what? Work?
I can't get a break on this case.
I don't even know who the hell this Carlotta dame is.
Can you get a map of South America?
- Yeah. You got something?
- Look up Peru.
Got it!
There's a little town on the coast called Paita.
Tell me where it is.
It's right next to a tiny little island called...
You son of a gun! Carlotta!
Damn! It's not a woman's name.
It's a place.
- Thanks, Marlowe. I owe ya.
- Good.
I'm leaving for Carlotta right now.
Even if Juliet's gone, I'm gonna solve this case...
No matter how many killers are involved, even if Juliet's one of 'em.
Any idea where in Carlotta
I should start looking?
There's a little café right on the bay.
When I arrived, I thought of the words
Marlowe had said to me 15 years ago:
"Dead men don't wear plaid."
Huh!
Dead men don't wear plaid.
I still don't know what it means.
Carlotta was the kind of town where they spell trouble T-R-U-B-I-L...
and if you try to correct them, they kill you.
I knew Marlowe had steered me right.
There was Kitty Collins, the girl who ditched me in Santa Barbara.
Señor Reardon.
Manuel Alesandro.
Not quite.
Carlos Rodriguez.
- Carlos Rodriguez?
- Sí.
Before the war... we ran guns to the rebels.
Oh, yeah.
You're a cop.
Sí, sí, sí.
I have joined the establishment.
That's good, Carlos. I'm here on an investigation. Maybe you can help me.
There is much to investigate in Carlotta.
The whole island is like a powder keg.
There is much tension, the... the smell of something rotten.
That's what I'm here for. To find out what it is that smells.
Psst!
Be careful of the, uh, fat one who sweats a lot.
What about Kitty Collins?
She doesn't sweat as much, but she's just as dangerous.
♪ What you want
♪ Everybody wants
They say she is one of them.
Who is... "them"?
Nobody knows. Only they know who is "them".
But there is a man. His name is Arroz. Rice.
Kitty Collins is in love with him.
He is a killer.
- Rice, huh?
- Uh-huh.
- Thanks, Carlos.
- De nada, señor.
- Where are you staying?
- Hotel Guano.
Ha! I'll be in touch.
Cuidado, Señor Reardon.
Cuidado, Carlos... Cuidado.
I wanted Kitty Collins to tell "them" I was in town...
So I tossed a five-pesetaria coin into the bowl.
The clank was loud enough to make her look my way.
That five-pesetaria coin was the best investment I ever made.
The next day, I hooked a big fish:
A fat one who sweats a lot.
- Señor?
- Nothing alcoholic. Oh, a beer, maybe.
Sí, señor.
Hard liquor goes to my feet.
- (COINS CLATTER)
- Just a minute, Mr Rigby.
We know who you are, Mr Rigby.
I'm interested. Who am I?
You could be a guy who collects $10,000...
Just to leave this stinkin' town.
- I could, could I?
- You know who I could be?
Hunchback of Notre Dame?
I could be the guy who hands ya... them $10,000.
$10,000. Me to you... just like that.
Sorry. My price for leaving stinking towns is 11,500...
And a kiss on the lips from Carmen Miranda.
Pass it on to "them". Room 204.
Room 204, señora.
Come in.
Right on time, Kitty.
Been expecting ya.
Thought you'd come last night.
- I wasn't thinking too well last night.
- Keep talking.
You see, I just found out something, Rigby.
Who you are, what you do, and why you're in Carlotta.
I'm here to bust up your game.
I don't get it. A class girl like you in love with a killer like Rice.
Who... what... why?
When you love someone...
I guess it doesn't make any difference who, what or why.
You go right on loving them.
Yeah, you do, don't ya?
- I feel as if...
- (PHONE RINGS)
Make me another drink, will you, baby?
Hello?
- What's up, amigo?
- Plenty.
A plane arrived today, and all the passengers spoke German.
- German?
- Mm-hm. Our friend Rice was there.
They gave him a packet.
It was marked today's date...
- ...and "Final Instructions".
- How do you know?
I was hired to protect Rice until he gets on that plane with Kitty Collins...
Tonight after the
Carlotta Festival.
Why are you telling me this?
Because the lives of millions of innocent p...
Carlos? Carlos!
Carlos!
Damn.
Where are you and
Rice headed tonight?
What do you know about a plane with Germermans on it?
Germerm... Germans.
Germermans.
There's a plane with mermans on it.
The plane's in town.
Ethel Merman came in on it.
Wanna go see Ethel Merman with me?
I'll buy two tickets.
Let me get on my pajamas,
I'll be ready to go.
I'd done some brilliant things in my time.
Asking Kitty Collins to mix me a drink wasn't one of them.
When I came to, I could make out only light and shadow at first.
Then I saw an unfamiliar face.
But even in my stupor...
I knew he was one of the big fish in the conspiracy: Rice!
Well, I believe that about winds things up.
- I'm gonna wind you up on a rope.
- But you're the one who's gonna die.
Better make it look good. If anything fishy happens to me, the FBI...
It'll look very natural.
People who know Rigby Reardon know
I'd never die a natural death.
Do you think I'd leave you around to talk?!
You've already talked too much!
Hold it, Rice!
You're not getting on that plane tonight. I want those papers.
I'm gonna walk out of this room. You won't shoot.
I won't?
That was a warning shot, Rice. And I don't fire as many of 'em as I used to.
Rigby! Señor!
- I heard shots.
- I'm all right.
- Rice went that way.
- Come on, Carlos!
Are you wearing pajamas?
Señor, I'll help you take them off.
I don't need help with my pajamas! Stop!
- Sí.
- Carlos!
Sí. Don't worry about your pajamas, señor. I'll take care of them.
CARLOS: Out of the way!
We are chasing a killer!
Everybody stand back! He's with me.
Coming through!
Señor!
Cuidado, señor. Cuidado!
- CARLOS: Stand back!
- RIGBY: Cuidado!
Señor! Your pajamas!
Forget the pajamas!
- Are you all right?
- It's just a bullet.
My wife Carmelita will suck it out. Go ahead, señor.
And don't worry about your pajamas. I'll take care of them!
"Final Instructions".
So that's their game.
"Rasmussen Place".
The last thing I expected to see was
Juliet and her father, alive...
Talking with their butler, who was dressed in a Nazi uniform.
Yeah. That explained a lot.
Why Juliet was able to translate
German, for one thing.
I'd been played for a sucker.
But it wasn't too late to set things straight.
Yaaah!
OK, hands in the air.
Over on the steps. Let's go!
It's time for a class picture. Tall ones in back, short ones in front.
Now sit! Hold hands.
Now smile.
- That's nice.
- Rigby...
Hold it! Stay where you are, you dirty, lying Nazi scum.
Rigby!
I should have known. I fell for a dame who played me for a sucker.
No, Mr Reardon. She did not play you for a sucker.
I did. Pretending to be a butler, waiting on inferior races was galling to me.
- But I fooled everyone.
- You see, Rigby? I didn't betray you.
- How did you know to come here?
- Marlowe told me.
That's how I found Daddy.
I smelled his cheese molds.
I am sorry to interrupt such a tender scene...
But we have a plan to carry out now.
- Who are you really, kraut?
- Field Marshal Wilfred von Kluck.
- At your service.
- Von Kluck?
Former chief of Hitler's
Special Secret Weapons Corps.
I'm flattered. How did you know?
I figured out your whole stinking scheme.
How you duped Dr Forrest into helping you. How you flew in your agents!
The finest officers in the Führer's army.
- Former army.
- For the moment.
But we shall rise again.
- We'll see about that.
- How did they use Daddy?
Bullet-head here found out your father had developed a cheese mold...
So powerful it could decompose rocks, trees and mountains.
He devised a plan to dissolve the entire United States.
At first your father gave this swine information because...
Please, Mr Reardon. Allow
me to tell the story.
- Your father went along...
- Mr Reardon.
It is customary in these situations for the developer of the plan to describe it.
I beg your pardon. It's customary for the private eye to tell how he figured it out.
No, it is my right!
We were able to dupe Dr Forrest by posing as a humanitarian organization... who planned to wipe out hunger by aging cheese faster.
- When he saw what they were doing...
- He assembled lists of our agents...
- And seemed about to go to the FBI...
- We had to drug him and bring him...
Here, faking his death so there'd be no investigation...
But while testing the mold on a small island nearby...
The Immer Essen passed by. Some of the passengers saw the island dissolve...
They were therefore labeled "enemies".
We had Neff cancel all further tours, and our...
Friends systematically began to eliminate everyone on that cruise ship!
- Schweinehund!
- Jerk!
Now...
We are ready. Our agents have just returned...
After planting cheese bombs throughout America.
With America destroyed, we will win the next war.
And the one after that, too!
When these switches are thrown, your meddling country will disintegrate...
Like a moldy hunk of Liederkranz!
Hold the mold, Kluck. Those switches aren't going to be thrown.
Und I think they will be.
Halt ihn!
Good... good.
I'm sorry to prevent your becoming a hero, Herr Reardon.
Actually, it is too bad you and I are on opposite sides.
I admire your tenacity. Under different circumstances...
I might have even allowed you to live, perhaps as my, uh... valet, or butler.
And what would you have me become, Herr Field Marshal?
- What?
- I said...
What position could I hold in your "New Order"?
Juliet! What are you saying?
He's a Nazi! Don't beg a Nazi!
Would I be your... Reinemachefrau?
Ja, you could, uh... you could be that.
- What is that? What is it?!
- JULIET: Tell him.
- Reinemachefrau.
- Rrrreinemachefrau.
It means she could be my... cleaning woman.
Cleaning woman!
All right, join your pals.
Let's go! Move it!
Great work, Juliet. Go find
Carlos Rodriguez for me.
All right.
Your having that gun won't stop us, Herr Reardon.
We are a dedicated people, willing to sacrifice ourselves!
There are only six bullets in that gun. There are nine of us.
Thus at least three will survive to throw those switches.
OK. But who's going to win the lottery...
And who's going to lose?
Cowards! Fools!
I'll do it myself!
Sorry, pal. You're through.
Not... quite.
At least... we got...
Terre Haute, India... na.
Damn! They were just about to get a public library.
Carlos, lock these creeps up.
With pleasure!
OK, creeps. ¡ Vámonos! Let's go!
Schweinehunds! Pig dogs!
I pity the Devil the day you boys start arriving in bunches.
Señor Reardon, when will you be leaving Carlotta?
- Next plane out, Carlos.
- Aha!
That gives me four hours to wash and press your pajamas.
No, thanks, Carlos.
I don't think I'll be needing my pajamas any more.
What a guy!
What are you... doing?
Adjusting your willie.
When you fell through the window, it shifted out of whack.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
I hadn't had my willie adjusted like that in a long time...
Especially without having to beg.
So there it was... the Carlotta mystery...
All wrapped up in a neat little bundle.
As I stood there kissing Juliet, I thought of nothing but hanging up my gun...
and spending the rest of my days in that ivy-covered cottage.
Little did I realise that less than a year later...
She and I would have an even more exciting adventure...
Which is coming soon to your neighbourhood theater...
With a possible nude scene by Juliet.
[thunder]
[clock chimes]
[thunder]
They're waiting for you in the drawing room, sir.
Thank you, Barnsby.
Oh, Barnsby?
I'd rather like you to join us, if you don't mind.
[thunder]
Have you found Lady Ridgeley's jewels?
Yes, Inspector, have you found my cabochon ruby?
No, Your Ladyship, but I have found something else.
The identity of Lord Fenley's murderer.
Inspector, you're not trying to imply that one of us could have actually performed such a loathsome deed?
It's quite ridiculous.
I simply don't believe it.
Not only do I believe it, Mr Montrose, but I have the evidence to prove it.
All of you had sufficient motive.
It could have been... any one of you.
You, Sir Derek, have been falsifying the accounts of Finwick Industries with the help of your son-in-law Mr Foxwell.
And you were also aware that Lady Ridgeley was having an affair with Lord Fenley which ended abruptly when he resumed his dalliance with Lady Foxcroft.
You see, she had stumbled upon the knowledge that Barnsby was in truth
Lord Fenley's half brother and the illegitimate father of Mr Peter Montrose, who was planning to gain control of Fenley Industries with the help of Mr Da Silva, who risked bankruptcy if the plot failed.
Yes, you all had motives.
Any one of you could have done it.
But only one of you did.
A person sitting in this room?
At this very moment?
Yes, Miss Kate, in this very room.
This ridiculous cat-and-mouse game has gone on long enough!
Very well, then.
Lord Fenley's murderer...
[audience groans]
[man] Oh dear, oh dear.
Lights, Mr Paycock, please.
I'll have it fixed in no time, no time at all.
I'd say that's highly unlikely.
Oh, dear.
Now we'll never know who did it.
[woman] It does seem rather obvious who the murderer was.
Who, Miss Marple?
Do tell us. Was it Sir Derek?
I hardly think so, Miss Giles.
It's unlikely he would have murdered his business partner, not while he only had
49% of the business, and the controlling interest would have reverted to Lord Fenley's sister, a bitter enemy of Sir Derek's.
I'll bet it was that young blaggard Lord Peter.
Impossible, Major.
Excuse me, dear.
The only tracks leading to Lord Fenley's estate that evening were bicycle tracks.
But he hated Lord Fenley.
Yes, but you forget, young Peter had a birth defect which caused a malfunction to the inner ear.
This loss of equilibrium in his system would have made it impossible for him to maintain his balance on a bicycle.
[Marple] Good night, Major.
Excuse me, Mrs Morley-Smith.
Good night, Dolly.
Good night, Jane.
I still say it was that awful butler.
It was Barnsby, don't you think, Miss Marple?
- I most certainly do not.
- But the revolver in his drawer?
Barnsby had never been to Lord Fenley's estate'
The footprints on the night of the murder led directly to the smaller bedroom off the left wing where Lord Fenley frequently sought privacy.
Whoever killed him knew how to go directly to that room.
Well, then who did do it, Miss Marple?
Who murdered Lord Fenley?
Why, young Miss Kate, of course.
Why do you say Miss Kate?
Because when the body of Lord Fenley was discovered, the knife was firmly implanted in the chest to the left.
A right-handed person would have clearly been unable to strike such a thrust in that direction.
If you'd looked closely, you would have noticed
Miss Kate was twirling her pearls in her left hand.
Good night, Vicar. I'm sure you'll have this contraption running in no time'
Good night, all.
[chatter]
She could be wrong, you know.
She's not. I've seen the picture.
I never would have guessed that ending.
That girl, she looked so nice.
Human nature, Cherry dear
The world of the cinema, the village, it's all quite the same, really.
[man] Listen to me, Marty.
I don't care what those tea-guzzling limey sons of bitches are demanding, those tea-guzzling limey sons of bitches are gonna make this picture a hit.
So stop playing around and give them what they want!
Look, I don't want to argue with you.
I'm the director and if I want three dozen poker-playing kangaroos with PhDs, then you'd better damn well go out and find them.
- Do I make myself clear?
- [Marty] Absolutely.
- How's Marina?
- Marina? [chuckles]
She's just fine, Marty.
- Thank you, Bates.
- Thank you, Bates.
Mrs Bantry, I really must apologise.
Marina's had to go for a costume fitting up to town.
Miss Gregg was particularly anxious that I should tell you how sorry she is to have missed you today.
Of course, I quite understand.
By the way, what picture are you over here to make?
- It's called Mary Queen of Scots.
- Really? How very interesting.
Marina was especially keen for me to double-check with you personally all the arrangements for the village fete.
- She's terrified no one's gonna come.
- [chuckles]
We are rather intruders here.
My dear Miss Zielinsky,
Miss Gregg's arrival has caused considerable excitement.
It's not every day we have a real-life film star and her director husband living here at St Mary Mead.
Oh, Jason, we were just talking about you.
- Mr Rudd, Mrs Bantry.
- Mrs Bantry.
How do you do?
I cannot tell you how happy my wife and I are to be in your house.
Mr Rudd, you must get it out of your head that this is my house.
After the Colonel, my husband, died, it was much too big for me.
And I'm much more comfortable down at the lodge'
Well, I really must be on my way.
- Would you like some more tea?
- No more tea, thank you.
- Very nice to have met you, Mr Rudd.
- Very nice to meet you.
No, no, no, please, please.
I think I can find my own way out.
Please give my regards to your wife.
Goodbye, Miss Zielinsky.
Mrs Bantry.
- Where's Marina?
- Upstairs, out like a light.
- Is she taking those damn pills again?
- Well, you shake her, she rattles.
I want her to be happy.
God knows, she's been through enough.
She'll be happy. Till she gets bored playing the lady of the manor'
Ella!
Sorry.
Don't spoil it.
OK?
OK.
[chatter]
[brass band plays]
[woman] Now, boys.
Don't drink this too quickly.
Otherwise, you're going to have very sore tummies.
[children shout]
Quite a turn-out.
More like Buckingham Palace than Gossington Hall.
Mind you, it plays havoc with the lawn.
Ah, good afternoon, Mrs Bantry,
Miss Giles.
- Afternoon, Major, Jane.
- Darling, Miss Giles.
- Do you think she'll come down?
- Who?
Marina Gregg, the film star!
Really, Miss Marple.
Well, I don't know anything about film stars, Miss Giles, but if this gathering is any indication of her local interest,
I'm sure that Miss Gregg won't disappoint her fans.
I do hope not.
I'm sure Mr Foxley, our dear postman, will herald her arrival with suitable fanfare.
[brass band continues]
[brass band stops playing]
[brass band plays ”There's
No Business Like Show Business '9
Steady, boys. Don't rush. Don't rush!
Miss Marple, you were right!
[applause]
Can you turn this way, please?
Just one more?
- Excuse me!
- Thank you.
- Mrs Babcock?
- Yes?
Miss Gregg would like to thank those of you that worked so hard.
Perhaps you'd like to come up to the hall.
Yes, indeed! I'd be absolutely thrilled!
Thank you very much!
Isn't it exciting?
- You know, Wendy...
- Yes, I know, you met her once.
Oh!
Major, ladies, we'd be honoured if you'd join us for refreshments.
- Yes, indeed. Most kind.
- We'd be delighted, wouldn't we?
She's so beautiful.
But not much of a shot, is she?
Oh, thank you, my friends.
My new, dear, wonderful, sweet friends, thank you.
Marina.
Jason's screaming for you, your guests are piling up.
Oh, but I'm having such fun.
Try a little restraint.
Perhaps I could borrow some of yours.
We seem to be sharing so much these days.
Now, boys and girls, on your marks.
Ready, steady, 90!
[crowd shauts encouragement]
[dog growls]
Roy! Come here. Come here, Roy!
Come here, boy. Come along.
That's a good boy. Sit. There.
Freddie Hawkins! Would you kindly take control of your dog?
You know perfectly well he should be held on his lead.
Sorry, Miss Marple.
[whistles] Roy! Roy!
Oh, Miss Marple!
Oh, goodness. Are you alright?
- That'll teach me to be dogmatic.
- [both chuckle]
- Can I have one?
- Thank you very much.
- Can I have a spoon?
- Here's a spoon.
I assure you, Dr Haydock,
I'm perfectly alright.
Perhaps you'd care to join the egg-and-spoon race.
It's just about to start.
- You had a nasty fall.
- Nonsense! I'm not even shaken.
In fact, I'm amazed nothing's broken.
You got away with just a sprain.
I never did discover the secret of your bone structure.
Long brisk walks as a young woman,
I expect.
Well, you're not walking anywhere for a few days.
I'll run you back in my car. That's it.
I'll fill you in on all the gossip you'll miss up at the hall
- when I call round to see you tomorrow.
- Gossip?
I prefer to call it a healthy interest in human nature.
[Haydock chuckles]
[boys yell]
- Cherry.
- [Cherry] Yes, Mr Bates.
See to that lot upstairs, will you?
They're doing their best to drink us dry.
I'm afraid, Miss Gregg, that it would seem that our committee have always felt that your films are a little, how shall I say, risqué for our monthly soirée in the village hall.
[laughs]
- How sweet of you.
- Your lemonade, Vicar.
Oh, thank you. Most kind.
Marina honey, the mayor is upstairs.
I think you should...
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Do excuse me.
- Yes.
Excuse me.
Is this your first visit to the United Kingdom, Mr Rudd?
Why, no, I've been...
[gasps] Oh, what a divine necklace!
Well done, Mr Rudd.
First-rate show.
Ah, Mrs Babcock.
Mrs Babcock is our untiring secretary.
The Women's Institute would be quite lost without her.
I'm sure she's been wonderful.
Now, Miss Giles. How about your cat?
- I keep forgetting its name.
- Matthew.
- [Vicar] That's right!
- [Miss Giles] Your dear wife had a cat.
[Vicar] Yes, but it always suffered from eczema.
[Miss Giles] Carrots. Mashed carrots and a little warm milk works wonders.
Marina? Mrs Babcock, Miss Gregg.
Miss Gregg, Mrs Babcock.
- Mrs Babcock, lovely to see you.
- Oh, Miss Gregg.
I know this is very silly, and I'm sure you don't remember, not with all the millions of people you meet...
No, no, no, of course not,
How could you? It was ages ago.
It was during the war.
I was in Plymouth in the Wrens and you came over to entertain all those marvellous Gls.
Oh, I remember it so well, just like it was yesterday.
[woman] I told you I lost my borage, last year in the frost?
[man] I'm sorry about that.
You know what to do, don't you?
Cut it right down to the ground in the...
Oh, Mr Rudd, I understand that you are a film producer.
- No, sir. A director.
- ls there any difference?
Yes, sir. The producer supplies all the money, the director spends it.
Then the producer yells at the director for spending too much money, the director doesn't pay attention and goes on spending.
The director gets the credit, the producer gets an ulcer.
It's all very simple. Excuse me.
[brass band plays]
[excited chatter]
- [man] It's Lola Brewster!
- [woman] It is?
[mar?] Yes!
[woman] It is!
[man] Miss Brewster!
Uh-oh. Mary Queen of Sluts and Baby Bernhardt under the same roof.
That's all we need.
[woman] Miss Brewster, look this way.
Oh, I was so thrilled.
Absolutely thrilled.
You were wearing that wonderful blue sparkling dress.
Do you remember what you sang?
I'll Be Seeing You.
Oh, I was a mad fan of yours.
How sweet.
How absolutely, perfectly sweet.
Oh, but then the most awful thing happened.
Or I thought it was awful.
I was terribly upset.
[Miss Giles] Do you mean to say you actually met Clark Gable?
Is he married at the moment or is it just a rumour that he's a lonely person?
- Jason.
- Is that the fellow with the big ears?
- Excuse me.
- Oh, Major.
- Lola's here.
- What?
- Marty brought her.
- Why in the hell did he bring her here?
I wasn't ill, just poorly.
You know what I mean?
Then I had this idea.
You see,
I didn't have a ticket or anything“.
Save it for the Oscars.
But this is the most extraordinary part.
You'll never guess who my uncle was.
He was the stage door keeper.
Now isn't...
Jason, darling!
- My Svengali.
- Glad you could make it.
Where is sweet Marina?
Jason, baby. Nice spread you got here.
I ought to spread you across this room for bringing her here.
Publicity, bubbie. That's what keeps
Martin N Fenn Productions in business.
[Mrs Babcock] I was in the theatre, standing in the wings.
It was my first time there.
It was so exciting.
Oh, you were wonderful!
And when the curtain came down, you gave me your autograph and you let me kiss you.
Oh, yes, you did!
Oh, it was worth it a hundred times.
I've never forgotten it...
[sound fades]
I do believe it was the most exciting day of my life'
What a nice little story, dear.
Now what will you have to drink?
Jason makes a wonderful daiquiri, you'll adore it.
Thank you.
Honey.
Oh, Jason, darling.
We'd like two of your special daiquiris.
Sure. Are you alright?
- I'm fine, Jinks.
- Are you sure?
Yes.
[photographer] That's great.
Thanks, Miss Brewster.
Marina, darling! I didn't see you.
Why, Lola. What a delightful surprise.
You're looking as lovely as always.
Of course, there are fewer lights on than usual.
In fact, any fewer and I'd need a seeing-eye dog.
Oh, I shouldn't bother to buy one, dear.
In that wig you could play Lassie.
Same adorable sense of humour.
And I'm so glad to see you not only kept your gorgeous figure, but you've added so much to it.
What are you doing here so early, dear?
I thought the plastic surgery seminar was in Switzerland.
Actually, darling, I couldn't wait to begin our little movie.
You know the saying,
"Once an actress, always an actress."
Oh, I do know the saying.
But what does it have to do with you?
Cute angel.
So do tell, how does it feel to be back after being away so long?
[Marina] Love your outfit, darling.
Drink, Mrs Babcock?
Mr Rudd is getting me one himself, thank you.
[Marina] What are you supposed to be, a birthday cake?
Too bad everybody's had a piece.
- Can we have a big smile, ladies?
- Chin up, darling. Both of them.
A little bit closer, please, ladies.
Lola, dear, you know there really are only two things I dislike about you.
Really? What are they?
- Your face.
- Thank you.
- One daiquiri special.
- Oh, thank you very much.
- I've never really tried one before.
- Enjoy it.
- Here you are, my dear.
- Oh, thank you, darling.
How are my two favourite stars getting along?
What are you trying to do, give Marina another breakdown?
Why would I want to do a thing like that, pumpkin?
Come on. Remember they used to grind glass in each other's cold cream.
One would only kiss the other if she had viral pneumonia.
They're professionals.
They take their job seriously.
- So did Attila the Hun.
- Marina, baby!
Oh, Marty, darling.
How thoughtful of you to bring Lola to my party.
You know, I've always thought of Lola
as one of my oldest, oldest friends.
[chuckles]
Jason, darling, I'm certainly looking forward to working under you again.
Watch it, Lola.
Jason, how about a drink with an old pal'?
- I only drink with friends.
- What am I, chopped chicken liver?
Bad enough forcing me to use your wife in this picture, but bringing her here with Marina in the condition she's in.
- Think of the picture!
- I am!
- And the sanity of my leading lady!
- Bubbie, listen to me.
She's gonna be fine.
I'm looking out for our best interests.
[laughs] Our best interests?
Hey, De Mille, why don't you face reality?
When was the last time
Marina made a movie?
- The advent of sound?
- [scoffs]
When did you direct a movie that was any good?
- Well...
- Listen to me.
If Martin N Fenn wants to get publicity for his two leading ladies, he's gonna get it, without any dissent.
Because the esteemed director and his wife are only here because of his good wishes.
And if he wishes, he can pull the plug any time he wants, you got it?
- Whoopee.
- Good.
- So go and enjoy the party.
- You know what?
- What?
- You're a bastard.
Of course I'm a bastard.
I'm the producer.
Oh, Mr Rudd. I believe I've reached some understanding about the difference between a producer and a director.
But who chooses the leading lady?
Whoever's sleeping with her.
Er, Vicar, may I introduce our noted producer Mr Martin N Penn'?
I'm sure he'll tell you everything you want to know.
What would you like to know,
Vicar, baby?
I'm sorry about your ulcers, Mr Fenn.
What?
Jason, we've got a problem upstairs.
That woman.
Marina.
[Cherry] Then the police came.
They took everybody's name.
They kept us there for hours, they did.
I just couldn't believe it.
I mean, she seemed as right as rain.
She was only five years older than me.
There was an awful flap.
Poor Mrs Babcock.
I mean, she just had one drink and about five minutes later, she sits down, sort of gasps...
...and then she's dead, poor thing.
What do you think of that?
Don't forget under the curtains, Cherry dear.
- Miss Marple, I hope you don't mind.
- Mind?
Well, me doing Saturdays up at the hall,
I did so want to see all those film stars.
- It's not going to upset you?
- No, Cherry dear. It won't upset me.
In fact, it might even prove useful.
Really?
Put that duster away and sit down and tell me everything that happened.
- Well...
- Exactly as it happened.
Well, I was moving about...
Yes, of course, but what precisely did you see?
Well...
[Cherry] The whole village was there,
of course.
And there was a girl taking pictures.
Just about everybody. There was
Marine Gregg and her husband
Oh, I liked him.
I think he's smashing.
- [Miss Marple] Cherry, dear.
- [Cherry] Oh, sorry.
Then the secretery girl came up
with Heather Babcock
and Heather shook hands with Miss Gregg
and then she went into a boring old
story about how they'd met years ago.
On and on she went. I thought
Miss Gregg was gonna fall asleep-
Honestly, she did go on, so.
Then a few minutes later, you served Heather a drink and not long afterwards, she dies.
Oh, no. No, I didn't serve her.
It was Mr Rudd.
- One daiquiri special.
- Oh, thank you.
Enjoy it.
[Cherry]
I don't think she really liked it.
Thank you, Cherry dear, you've been very helpful.
- [Cherry] Have I?
- Extremely.
- Oh, good.
- [knocking at door]
Oh, I'll get it.
- [man] Morning, Cherry.
- Morning, Doctor.
Morning, Miss Marple. How's the leg?
Good morning, Dr Haydock.
You know, I think it's very much better.
Shall I do upstairs now, or finish here in the lounge?
- This is the drawing room, Cherry dear.
- Sorry, drawing room.
- Upstairs, I think.
- Right.
Oh, later on, I'll bring you in a nice cup of tea.
Poor Heather Babcock.
Mmm.
She was a patient of yours, wasn't she?
She was on my list.
- Heart trouble?
- Nothing wrong with her heart.
- Which does rather...
- Stick out your tongue.
- Say "aah".
- Aah.
- Put it back.
- Which does rather suggest poison.
I think we should leave that to the coroner, don't you?
Glad to see you started my treatment.
Treatment?
Unravelling, aren't I right?
You will have your little joke,
Dr Haydock.
[both chuckle]
You can't pull the wool over my eyes, dear lady.
Look at you. Your cheeks are pink, your eyes bright.
You're enjoying yourself.
Isn't that so?
Dr Haydock, I would be very distressed if I thought you believed that the only excitement in my life was predicated on the unfortunate fate of helpless victims who somehow seem to fall into my path.
Upon examination, the deceased's body was found to contain massive traces of a barbiturate.
Phenobarbital.
Unquestionably the cause of death.
Had she a medical history for which such a drug could have been prescribed?
Virtually none, sir.
Apart from chickenpox as a child and German measles during the war.
According to her doctor, she was in excellent health.
Thank you.
Bearing in mind the evidence we have heard,
I have no choice but to record a verdict of murder by poison at the hand of person or persons unknown.
- Dermot!
- Hello, Aunt Jane.
My favourite nephew.
What a pleasant surprise.
What are you doing here?
- Why, I've come to see you.
- Or to enquire about Heather Babcock.
What would a chief inspector from
Scotland Yard be doing in St Mary Mead if poor Heather had died of natural causes?
Well, he might have been passing by and suddenly had a craving for some of your special peach jam.
Now, Dermot, you know very well
I haven't made peach jam since Taphrina deformans attacked my Russell reds.
Now come and sit down and let's have a little chat, shall we?
It was poison, wasn't it?
Aunt Jane, you wouldn't mind very much
I suppose if I anyway began
- by asking the question, would you?
- [laughs]
The poison was apparently an American barbiturate, marketed under the name of Calmadon.
It appears the principal ingredient of it is...
Phenylethylmalonylurea.
I know it from my days at Bridge Hampton Hospital in the war.
Mixed with alcohol, it causes respiratory depression.
A drop in blood pressure.
Feeble heartbeat. Quite deadly, in fact.
And you naturally knew the victim,
Babcock?
Ooh, yes. Of course.
She was a simple soul. Friendly enough.
A bit of a bore, but you don't kill someone for that.
If you did, there'd be no one left in the village.
[laughs]
Well! So you're not being much help, Aunt Jane.
No, I realise that.
So Mrs Babcock refused your offer of a drink?
Yes, she said Mr Rudd was getting her one. I told you that.
- And Miss Gregg?
- It's funny you should say that.
- Funny?
- Well, not funny.
Kind of strange, really.
Go on, Cherry. Slowly.
Try to remember everything.
Well, it... it was a sort of look on Marina Gregg's face.
What kind of a look?
Sad? Angry? Surprised? Frightened?
I don't know.
Cherry, dear, take your time.
Think back.
Try to remember the precise look.
Well, it was sort of... frozen.
[Cherry] She was staring over
Heather Babcockfis shoulder
like she wasn't listening to what she was saying.
[Marple] Go on.
[Cherry] She was looking towards the stairs. There's a religious picture.
Then Lola Brewster arrived with her husband, the producer. Funny man.
Wouldn 't be surprised if he dyes his hair.
The girl took a photo.
Heather Babcock was rattling on
and Miss Gregg had this sort of strange frozen look.
What specifically was she looking at'?
The people? The picture?
- Obviously one of the people.
- Oh, why do you say that?
Really, Dermot, she sees the picture every day.
Absolutely. I'm so sorry, Aunt.
Er, now, how long did Miss Gregg remain looking at that picture?
The Lady of Shalott.
Aunt Jane?
"Out ﬂew the web and ﬂoated wide -
The mirror crack'd from side to side;
'The curse has come upon me,' cried
The Lady of Shalott."
Tennyson, of course.
I do have a weakness for Tennyson.
And it does seem a rather suitable description.
Go on, Cherry dear.
Continue with your story.
Nothing much more to tell, really.
Lola Brewster came up to Miss Gregg.
I don't think they like each other much, if you ask me.
They had some pictures taken and then Mr Rudd came up.
He's so handsome.
Cherry, we want to hear about
Miss Babcock and Miss Gregg.
Did anything else happen?
No, I don't think
I've left anything out.
Heather spilled her drink and Miss Gregg walked away.
Spilled?
You say Heather spilled her drink?
Oh, yeah. Oh, didn't I say that?
Oh, I must have forgot.
[Cherry] I am silly, aren't I?
- Oh, Miss Gregg! I'm so terribly sorry.
- It's perfectly alright.
- Oh, will it stain?
- I'm sure not, I'm sure not.
Here, you take mine,
I haven't touched it.
Oh, no. I couldn't.
Please, it's no problem.
I'll get another.
So...
...Heather Babcock drank from Marina Gregg's glass.
Fate was rather unkind to poor Heather Babcock.
Seems we've been dealing with the wrong murder.
I suggest you proceed to Gossington Hall first thing in the morning.
To put to use all those cunning skills
I've inherited from a certain relative?
You know, Dermot, you really are my favourite nephew.
I'll let Mr Rudd know you are here, sir.
- Inspector Craddock?
- Yes.
Mr Rudd will be with you
as soon as he can, but I must warn you, he's awfully tied up.
Tied up?
Inspector, have you any idea what making a movie entails?
We have wardrobe tests, we have make-up tests, we have lighting tests.
- Rainbows End.
- I beg your pardon?
Yes, it was Marina Gregg's first Academy Award, wasn't it?
- Yes.
- I'll never forget that last scene.
So vivid, real.
Vulnerability, Miss Zielinsky.
Her modus operandi
Journey Home, Paradise Road.
Absolute conviction.
This indestructible ability to make us care.
- Now, they were facing this way.
- Inspector?
[Craddock] I'm sorry.
The guests when they were introduced.
Yes, that's right.
Those eyes.
Violent. Mesmerising.
It's a copy, of course.
No, no.
I was referring to Miss Gregg's eyes.
Yes, my earliest memory of those eyes was in Tomorrowfis Dawn.
She played a young socialite heiress who came from...
Now, where was it she came from?
- Boston.
- Boston, that's right!
She came from Boston and inherited land in California.
Do you mind...?
Do you remember that scene where they threatened to dig up her land?
The way she stood up to those gold-miners, that sweet, helpless young butterfly.
Tell me, might I speak to her, please?
- I'm sorry, she's resting.
- Oh.
- Well, perhaps later?
- Perhaps.
But sweet, helpless young butterflies do need their rest.
That snake-eyed son of a bitch,
Marty Fenn!
He always did have the class of a toad!
And he's putting up the money for your comeback, so calm down.
And putting that peroxide ﬂoozy into my film!
And as the virgin queen!
She's in two lousy scenes, neither of them with you'
Lola Brewster, actress.
If she's read the script,
I'd see a blister on her finger.
It's your picture all the way. Nobody will remember anyone else in it.
Oh, Jinksy.
- Do you really mean that?
- I'll make sure of it.
Oh, God. God, it has been so long.
You don't think there's any chance I have lost it, do you?
Oh, you'll be better than ever.
I promise.
My love. You're so good for me.
You always have been.
Oh, damn her! That bitch!
If you look at her carefully, there's so many lines on her face, you could drive a train on it!
Maybe I won't shoot her through a filter.
- Filter? Try using an Indian blanket.
- [chuckles]
You're gonna have to dub her voice in too.
Or write a line in the script that
Elizabeth is from Hoboken, New Jersey.
[sighs]
Bags, bags, go away-
Come right back on Doris Day.
[phone rings]
- Hello?
- [Marty] Jason, where the hell are you?
Lola's been sitting here for 20 minutes waiting for you.
She likes the feathers so much, she wants them in the costume.
I told her, a queen only wears feathers if he lives in Hollywood, but she won't believe me.
Jason, you get your ass over here!
- I've been thinking, poopsie.
- Oh, that's a new experience!
Maybe we should bring in Alexander for my hair.
Lamb chop, if I've told you once,
I've told you a thousand times:
Queen Elizabeth was bald.
- Not in this movie, she ain't.
- It's history.
So is Lola Brewster.
I'll be majestic.
Awesome. Inspiring.
[chuckles]
I'm going to wipe that cow right off the screen'
Let's see, we're gonna need some scenes with the two of us together, so the world can see how much younger and thinner I am.
Lola, baby.
Elizabeth and Mary never met.
Oh, maybe they meet at the market.
[chuckles] No, of course not, she'd never do her own shopping.
The beauty parlour?
No, they'd come to her.
Wait a minute.
I've got it.
I come to see her at the Tower of London.
It's right before the beheading and the rats are crawling all over her.
She's in rags, looking like shit.
And in walks... me.
- Inspector, I do have things to do.
- Yes, of course.
Miss Gregg and Miss Brewster, are they very close?
Close?
If you put the two of them together in a tank with a shark, the shark would have an identity crisis.
Tell me, I'm curious, who's younger?
Marina Gregg or Lola Brewster?
- Neither one. [sneezes]
- Bless you.
Oh. [sniffles]
[sneezes]
- You alright?
- Hay fever.
Those are maddening things, allergies.
I'm allergic to wool.
I find a tranquiliser helps me.
I use a drug called Calmadon.
- Do you know of it?
- We ship it in by the barrel.
Oh. Does Miss Gregg take it?
By the time this movie's over, there may be a world shortage.
- Do you take it?
- Do I have a choice?
Ah, I think it must be very exciting working for someone like Marina Gregg.
I'm sure she's a grand person.
Inspector, Marina Gregg can make
Medusa look like St Bernadette.
- Why don't you change your job?
- What, and quit show business?
I used to work for Jason before they were married.
I've learned to live with her tantrums and her breakdowns.
Breakdowns? But the image she projects on the screen is so rational.
Tell me about them.
- It's all rather turgid.
- Really, I'm fascinated.
Well, you can't mention illness or insanity or anything to do with children.
That's most interesting. Why not'?
Inspector, I really can't go into it.
I'm sure that Mr Rudd is a tower of strength to her.
- Devoted beyond the call of duty.
- And Mr Penn?
Marty Fenn is a producer.
He only lies when he speaks.
[chuckles]
I should think they've been pretty unsettled by the murder?
Murder?
Inspector, we have a picture to make.
We can't be bothered by little local difficulties.
[door opens]
Ah, Mr Rudd.
Could I ask you a few questions?
I'm in a rush. Talk to my secretary, she'll arrange an interview.
[Craddack] But I'm not a reporter.
- [phone rings]
- Mr Rudd.
Yes? Tell him I'm on my way, damn it.
Ten minutes!
- Mr Rudd.
- I told you, not now.
I'm Inspector Craddock,
Scotland Yard.
Everything we're doing is according to form.
British crew, extras.
I've waivers on my two leading ladies.
- We're in total compliance.
- If I might interrupt you.
I'm sure you're going to make a very fine picture without the aid of Scotland Yard.
I happen to be here on a minor matter of murder.
[Rudd] Oh, yes. Er, Miss...
Babcock, Heather Babcock.
- I'm truly sorry.
- If I might talk to your wife?
I'm sorry, no one may see her.
She's resting' Doctor's orders.
If you'll excuse me.
Mr Rudd, it's very important that I talk to her.
Inspector, my wife is about to start the most important role of her career.
Every ounce of energy is being devoted toward preparing this role.
She is going to win her third Academy Award and I will not distract her with...
Mundane matters like murder.
- Whatever you say, Inspector.
- Jinks.
[Craddock]
That's all very well and good.
I firmly believe your wife deserves a third Oscar.
I think she should have got it for Summer Rain, actually'
But has it occurred to you the death of Heather Babcock wasn't entirely accidental'?
That the intended victim was, in fact, your wife?
Now may I see her, please?
No, you may not.
My wife has been through a lot and I'm not only talking about last Saturday.
I'm sorry, but you're not going to give her a nervous breakdown.
Now, if you will excuse me.
[Craddock] I believe she's had several all ready.
- [Rudd] Several what?
- Breakdowns.
- [Rudd] Who told you?
- I thought it was common knowledge.
Ah, it's nice of you to let them play here.
What? Oh, the gardener's kids.
I thought they might have upset Miss Gregg.
Alright, Inspector, let's stop playing games.
There was a time years ago when Marina wanted children, badly.
The doctors told her she could never have any, so she adopted two.
Then a few years later... She was still married to her first husband.
She found out she was actually going to have one of her own.
Unfortunately, the child was born mentally retarded. An imbecile.
Marina had a complete breakdown.
She hasn't worked since.
I see.
Now maybe you can understand what this film means to her.
That she actually has the guts to appear in front of a camera again.
Yes, indeed.
This film's gonna turn everything around for her.
That's why if she ever found out, even suspected, she was the intended victim...
You don't believe the thought has entered her mind?
Not for a minute.
The idea of someone wanting to murder your wife doesn't bother you?
You've been seeing too many
Charlie Chan movies, Inspector.
Look, I'll be here the whole time.
When I'm not, my secretary won't let her out of her sight.
- You trust Miss Zielinsky?
- Of course I trust her.
She was there.
She had the opportunity.
- Ella is devoted to my wife.
- And to you too?
Jason, Marty phoned again!
He said if you're not there in ten minutes, he's getting John Houston!
Will there be anything else, Inspector?
Is that the Martin N Fenn who produced the Terror in Trinidad?
The one and only.
I've always wondered what the N stood for.
No idea.
How about "knockwurst"?
- [chuckles] Oh, Mr Rudd.
- What?
I was really most impressed with The Last Brigade.
Particularly, if I may say so, with your very subtle use of low-key lighting.
Why, thank you.
Shouldn't you be resting that foot,
Aunt Jane?
Old Edward's got his rheumatism again.
I really can't let the garden become like a jungle
Do you think Mr Rudd is fond of his wife?
- I'd say he adores her.
- What about Miss Zielinsky?
Business-like. Efficient.
Seemingly loyal.
Suffers from hay fever.
- Attractive?
- Yes, in a uncalculated sort of way.
- That's a very austere assessment.
- Maybe, but what are you implying?
I'm implying absolutely nothing.
I just find your lack of emotion, shall we say, a bit studied.
Oh, alright.
If you prefer I were more direct, then I'd say that given the right time, the right place, that Miss Zielinsky is probably... hotter than a pistol.
Hmm, perhaps we should return to austerity.
- Well, you brought it up.
- [laughs]
Seriously, do you believe she was telling the truth?
Well, let's say, I think she allowed her loyalties to become quite transparent'
- Her feelings for Mr Rudd.
- Exactly.
- A prime suspect, I'd say.
- Oh, would you, now? Well, well.
Where are you off to?
I'm off to the glamorous world of movie making.
I see this is not a particularly taxing case for you, Dermot.
Show business is just a business, Aunt Jane.
What we need is a little more business and a little less show.
In fact, there's a wonderful saying
I read not too long ago about Hollywood.
"Underneath all that phoney tinsel lies the real tinsel."
- That's very profound, Aunt Jane.
- Better be careful, Dermot.
They're liable to mistake you for Leslie
Howard and put you in the picture.
Well, I do have a certain charm, or so I've been told.
Perhaps it's time it was discovered.
Dermot! First discover
Heather Babcock's murderer.
Well, I'd better work fast before someone else does it for me.
[man] Shooting next time!
Let's have a shooting bell.
- [bell rings]
- Very quiet, everybody!
[Jason] Roll the camera!
- [Jason] Speed. Mark it.
- [man] Forget the board.
Lola Brewster, make-up test.
Take one. Board on end.
Alright, Lola honey, turn left.
Slowly.
Lovely. Now hold it there a moment.
Down with the chin a little.
Up with the eyes. Good.
Now, keep the chin down. Lovely.
Excuse me, gov. Could you check this?
Yeah.
[man] Dimmer on the key light.
Down a bit. Whoa.
It's not dark enough.
Don't you have Italian blood?
It's the stuff we always use.
Kensington Gore.
It looks like water.
Don't you people know that blood is thicker than water?
I want it thick like tomato juice.
Excuse me, sir, could you have a look at the guards, please?
They're supposed to be the queen's soldiers, not her ballerinas.
Yes, sir. Leave it to me, sir.
Now turn your head right.
No, dear. Not your shoulders, just your head.
Right. No, dear. Your right.
- Jason!
- Cut.
[man] Save the red.
- Yes, my dear.
- [bell rings]
Lest we forget, you do have an actress in this movie, one who also happens to be married to the producer.
No, I haven't forgotten.
I think it's important we discuss the queen's relationship with her father.
When the picture begins, the father's been dead over 30 years.
Why don't you go to your dressing room and put on a nice new costume, OK?
I told Marty we should have got George Cukor.
Swords and blood, that's all he thinks about.
That and that over-stuffed psycho of a wife.
Will you get your paws out of my hair?
Where did you get this wig, Woolworths?
Calls himself a director.
Did you see his last picture?
I could eat a can of Kodak and puke a better movie.
Oh, why, you must be Inspector Craddock.
They told me you'd be here.
How sweet of you to come.
Miss Brewster,
I'm a great fan of yours.
Isn't that nice?
And I now you'll excuse me while I change.
Yes. Yes, of course.
Please, you carry on.
Now, tell me, Inspector dear, what's on your mind?
I have a few questions regarding the murder of Heather Babcock.
- Who?
- The woman up at Gossington Hall.
Oh, yes. Who was she, an extra?
Ow! The zipper, you moron.
It's caught in my rump!
I'm sorry, Miss Brewster.
If I might digress for a moment.
I'd like... Oh, so sorry.
...to erm, ask about your relationship with Marina Gregg.
Gregg? Gregg, that name rings a bell.
- Come now, Miss Brewster.
- I'm just teasing you, Sherlock.
Of course I know Marina Gregg.
Isn't she that aging, broken-down ex-star trying so desperately for a comeback?
Here, try combing this out; they may find Amelia Earhart.
Now, tell me, Inspector dear, why don't you ask me some more of those searching questions?
I just love being examined, especially by someone as cute as you.
Erm, what I'm particularly...
Are you really from Scotland Yard?
A real-life Inspector?
I can just hardly believe it.
A real-life Inspector in my dressing room.
Oh, just think of me as a... what you call a cop.
Only if you brought your nightstick, honey.
[chuckles nervously]
- Miss Brewster.
- Oh, I'm sorry. I've upset you.
Forgive me,
I promise I'll be a good girl.
Now, about Marina.
Well, what can I say?
She was a great star. Was.
I mean, when I was just a teensy-weensy little girl, my grandmother used to take me to see all of her movies.
And then about ten years ago, around my 16th birthday, she had this awful collapse, poor thing.
Drugs, alcohol, insanity.
It's not easy when you've hit rock bottom.
Marty and I felt the least we could do was to give her a part in my picture.
- Yes, that's very charitable.
- Ow, not so tight.
- Erm, Miss Brewster?
- Inspector?
Wasn't there some kind of trouble between you and Miss Gregg
- a few years ago?
- Trouble? [laughs] Why...
Whatever do you mean?
When Miss Gregg began seeing Mr Rudd, weren't you and Mr Rudd...
Now, Inspector.
That's ancient history.
Besides, Jason and I were ending it anyway.
I was only too happy to see
Marina find a little companionship, lonely and pathetic creature that she was.
Is that why you aimed and fired a short-barrel 9mm Luger at her skull missing it by two and a half inches?
- Did the bitch tell you that?
- No, Miss Brewster.
The Beverly Hills Police Department.
Alright, so I got a little miffed.
I may be a great star, but I'm still human.
Human enough to try it again?
Only this time with poison?
- Are you insinuating?
- [knocking at door]
Merely exploring the possibility.
Er, ready, Miss Brewster.
Well, it seems that I must take my leave.
Thank you for our little... chat,
Miss Brewster.
And jolly good luck with your picture.
Miss Brewster, we're waiting.
Screw Scotland Yard!
[gasps]
Sorry, ma'am!
I was just taking a walk down to the village.
It's that way, ma'am.
Ah.
[sneezes]
Cherry dear, are the post office playing with the telephone lines again?
Don't think so, ma'am.
[phone rings]
Gossington Hall.
Hello? Hello?
What is that girl up to?
I saw you.
I saw you put the poison in Marina's glass.
[Miss Zielinsky] I saw you.
Look, that part's been cast.
Why didn't you call last week?
Leave your name and address with my secretary and we'll call you when“.
[line gees dead]
[laughs] Actors.
You know about actors, don't you?
They all live up there somewhere.
I knew a broad once.
I was making a Civil War epic.
We were supposed to shoot a big scene that day.
She comes to me and tells me she can't work that week. Know why?
Because her astrologist... tells her it's not in the stars.
So, I, er, pay this little creep a visit.
I give him a grand, right?
[laughs] He tells her the stars have made a sudden shift and if she doesn't report to work every morning on time, she's gonna lose her sex drive.
The next morning she was there before the janitor.
Won't you sit down?
- Yes, fields of Glory, wasn't it?
- Yeah, did you see that?
Yes, I found it a bit melodramatic.
It's not a very positive...
The only thing positive thing about it was the negative.
Inspector, what's on your mind?
Erm, how long have you known
Miss Gregg?
Marina? We've been friends a long time.
Have the two of you been, er, intimate?
Intimate?
Yeah, we've been intimate.
Everybody in Hollywood is intimate.
[phone rings]
Swifty! How are you, Swifty?
What are you doing?
Oh, things are great.
The girl's got the best spot in the picture. What do you want me to do?
I can't, Swifty. You gotta give me a break. Come on!
Wonderful. I owe you one. 
Thanks, pal.
Agents. He thinks he's got a lot of class.
He once sold me an actress, said she was great.
I called her in the morning, she'd been dead for six months.
[both laugh]
- Please go on. I'm sorry.
- Oh, thank you.
Erm, now then, about Miss Gregg.
Let me tell you something about Marina.
Secure, she ain't.
Under all that jewellery is a sad, insecure lady' ls there anyone you could think of who might want to harm Miss Gregg?
Yeah, Hedda Hopper.
No, I mean anyone involved in the picture. You, for instance.
Me? I'm the producer.
I'm coming up with $3.5 million to make this movie.
You think I'm going to bump off my leading lady two days before I start shooting the picture?
I've got contracts at Radio City
Music Hall for Christmas!
Unless, of course, someone else bumps her off.
If someone else bumps her off,
I'll prop her up and dub her to get her at the Radio City Music Hall at Christmas.
Harry, I want those pictures up here right now.
I don't care if she's having tea with Mickey Mouse, tell her to bring the pictures up here now!
Excuse me.
Anything else I can help you with?
I've got a picture to make.
- Errn, yes. Oh, just one thing, Mr Penn.
- Sure.
- I've always been curious about...
- What?
What does the N stand for?
You want to know what it stands for?
I'll tell you what it stands for.
Nothing.
But it sure looks great on that big silver screen, doesn't it?
- [laughs]
- Yes.
Goodbye.
- And thanks for your time, Mr Fenn.
- Any time.
Get me the coast.
What do you mean, what coast?
[butler]
Chief Inspector Craddock, madam.
Miss Gregg?
[Marina] That man is working on the lawn with such dedication.
[chuckles]
I'm Marina Gregg.
- At least what's left of her.
- Miss Gregg.
I understand you were here earlier.
I'm sorry for having to make you come back.
Please, please don't apologise.
I quite understand.
I hope you realise the, er, chaos of film making.
It really is rather a wretched business, you know.
I don't get to the cinema very often.
Ah, of course.
- Tea?
- Yes, please.
- Please.
- Thank you.
- Milk'?
- No milk, no sugar.
You know, it's funny.
I never drank tea in America.
Now I'm slowly becoming an addict.
Well, there's a little shop in the village, Hedgeworth, offers an extraordinary selection.
The most exotic brews.
[Marina] Oh, I'll have to check it out.
[chuckles] "Check it out."
You're probably thinking how hopelessly American she sounds.
You're here about that poor woman, aren't you?
Who would want to kill her'?
Do you have a clue?
Can you tell me about her'?
Me?
How would I know anything about her?
People said that the two of you spent some time talking together.
Ah, well, she spent time talking,
I spent time listening.
Can you be more specific, Miss Gregg?
Do you know what fans are like,
Inspector? I mean, real fans.
No. Why don't you tell me'?
Well, it seems...
Let me think,
I want to get this straight.
It seems we had met once, years ago during the war.
She remembered every detail of it, even down to the song I was singing, the dress I was wearing.
Funny thing is, I remember it too.
Anyway, I was entertaining the troops and she was sick or something, but she was determined to see me.
And she got out of bed, got dressed, got into the stage door.
Her uncle or someone was the door keeper.
And she waited in the wings until after my curtain call, and I signed her autograph or something.
She said it was the most exciting night of her life.
And you know, it probably was.
I'm so sorry. Erm, yes.
I understand there was a moment when you seemed startled about something or maybe even frightened.
Frightened?
It was about the time when
Mr Fenn and his wife appeared.
You looked at a picture on the landing.
Oh, that.
Yes, of course.
There... There was a moment.
I was talking to that woman, that fan, and she was going on and on, gushing.
I was feeling run out of thank yous and I just didn't know how to get out of it and I... just went blank.
Miss Gregg,
I hope you won't find this upsetting but can you think of anyone who might want to kill you?
- Why do you ask that?
- I must explore every possibility.
How do you get along with Miss Zielinsky?
Why are you asking these questions?
A local woman was murdered.
What does it have to do with me?
I came here to make a movie.
I came here with friends.
I came here with people that love me.
Why are you doing this to me? Why?
I'm trying to pull my life together.
They're behind me. My husband, Ella.
They won't let it happen.
They'll stand up for me'
Why are you doing this? Why?
Oh, God!
It was me, wasn't it?
It was me they were trying to poison, wasn't it'?
Who am I kidding?
Somebody is trying to kill me, aren't they?
Somebody is trying to... poison me, aren't they?
Somebody is trying to kill me, aren't they?
Aren't they? I know it! I can...
"I can feel it.
I can almost hear them coming."
- Danger in the Dark.
- [laughs]
MGM, 1932.
[continues laughing]
The scene when you thought your husband and your sister were trying to kill you and you broke down in front of the police.
Why, you sneaky little chief inspector.
I bet you've seen every one of my movies.
- Oh, at least twice.
- [chuckles]
That one was a real dog.
But you were most compelling in that scene, though
The critics didn't seem to think so.
If they'd been here today,
I'm absolutely certain they would have succumbed.
You didn't.
Well, I'm a detective, Miss Gregg.
It's my job to analyse behaviour off screen.
Well, I'm an actress. I act.
Yes, I think the performance was a little overdone, if I may say.
I would have settled for simple sincerity.
I didn't think you'd believe me.
I still don't think you believe me.
"You won't escape next time."
"Prepare to die."
One came here, the other was sent to the studio.
- When?
- This morning.
- Who delivered them?
- We don't know.
- We?
- My husband and I.
At first I thought it was a joke.
Some kind of joke, huh?
I don't think I've been so scared since I was a kid in Oklahoma City.
Shirley Bookbinder.
Prettiest little girl in town.
I really thought I was something.
Till one day I found...
I think I was around ten.
I found in my desk a note saying...
"Nobody likes you, Shirley."
I cried for three days.
I never did find out who wrote it.
See, the tough thing about having it, there's always somebody who wants to take it away.
And you know, they usually do.
Help me, Inspector, please.
- And I'm sure you will, Dermot.
- Well, I'll certainly try.
I suspect you're rather smitten with Miss Bookbinder.
Nonsense, Aunt Jane.
Trouble is, of course,
I now have enough suspects with enough motives to fill every shop in this high street.
Please make sure that you and little Jeremy John and the godparents are on time, because at 3:30 I have Mrs Cracknell and her little Jeremy John.
No, no, that's wrong. Mrs Cracknell's little Michael Jeremy John.
No, that's wrong too.
Mrs Michael's John.
No, that's not right either.
So confusing.
But I must get it right, mustn't I?
Well, see you Saturday, 3:30.
Ah, Miss Marple! Great news!
Mr Edwards down at the garage has been able to diagnose the problem.
We shall, therefore, hopefully no longer have to call upon you to resolve next Friday night's little extravaganza, Two Girls from...
I've forgotten where.
But I do hope to see you anyway.
Somewhere in America I'm sure.
Idaho. You can safely give that one a miss, Aunt Jane.
[Miss Marple] If you say so, Dermot.
Jamie.
Oh, Jamie.
How I've longed for you.
To take you in my arms and to clasp you to my bosom.
Jason, will you get that creep out of my eye line?
- Cut.
- Who? Who, me?
Was I in your eye line?
Oh, but I just wanted Jason to see my costume.
Dear, will you put the virgin queen back into her cage?
Lola, why don't you go study your lines?
Anything you say.
Anybody got a script breakdown?
Oh, I am so sorry.
I shouldn't have used that word.
- Tee's up!
- [bell rings]
Don't all rush. Plenty to go round.
Don't walk in front of the camera, for goodness' sake! Load of animals.
Are you OK?
Hmm?
I'm fine, Jinks.
That's my girl.
Excuse me.
- Coffee, Marina.
- Oh, thank you.
Jason, shall I get you a cup?
Could you come and look at this?
See if you can strike it? Thanks'
Thank you.
Jason, when do I get to play my scene with Sir Walter Raleigh?
- What?
- Jason! Jason!
- What is it?
- The...
The coffee.
There's nothing wrong with it, it's just a little strong.
- You're lying.
- Honey, come on.
You're lying! It's poisoned!
[Cherry] I'll see you in the morning,
Miss Marple. I've laid everything out.
And don't forget,
I left your dinner in the oven.
[Miss Marple] Thank you, Cherry dear.
[rings]
[inserts coin]
Remember me?
I saw you, murderer.
Good evening, miss.
Mr Rudd has been asking for you.
[sneezes]
[sneezes]
- [Jason] Where have you been?
- [gasps]
I've been out for a walk.
What's the matter with you?
You look terrible.
The coffee Marina almost drank on the set.
I had it analysed.
- Arsenic.
- Arsenic?
- How?
- I'm asking you.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You made it, you poured it.
- You gave it to her.
- Do you think I tried to poison her?
Yes!
No. I don't know.
I don't know what to think.
You really do love her, don't you, Jason?
Don't worry, I'm sure they'll find him.
- Him?
- Whoever did it.
[sneezes]
Oh, for God's sake, do something about that cold.
[sniffs]
- [Craddock] ls the doctor here?
- Yes, sir.
Mr Rudd called the station at 8:55, sir.
You'll have my report in the morning.
Alright, girls, you can go now.
Bates, if you'll stay, Constable Arnold will take your statement now.
Inspector, who would want to kill her?
The same person that tried to poison your wife.
Did you know that Miss Zielinsky was making a series of phone calls from the box in the village?
She was apparently playing detectives.
Phoning every suspect.
Telling them that she'd seen them poison Miss Gregg.
Waiting for a reaction.
If whoever she was talking to had took the bait, she'd find the murderer.
She obviously did.
You've seen the coffee analysis?
Yes. Mr Rudd, why didn't you tell me about these notes?
I obviously forgot about them.
Somebody threatened to kill your wife and you forgot?
- I thought I could handle it.
- Not very effectively, it seems.
What are you doing?
- I'm getting out of here.
- Marina.
I'm sorry, Jason, but I'm not staying here another night.
- What about the picture?
- To hell with the picture!
Somebody out there is trying to kill me.
- Think I'm gonna sit and wait for them?
- No one is going to hurt you.
- Oh, Jinks. I'm so scared!
- I know, I know.
But I'm here with you.
The police are on guard.
Why? Why would somebody want to hurt me?
Shh.
Why didn't you tell me about those notes?
What's the point?
Scare the hell out of you too?
Please, let's get out of here.
OK, we'll check into a hotel in the morning.
- Do you promise?
- I promise.
And we'll be together always.
Till death do us part.
Why'd you say that?
Seems we can eliminate
Miss Zielinsky as a suspect.
Murder is a very dangerous business.
If one gets mixed up in it, one must be prepared for the consequences.
She wasn't a pretty sight.
Prussic acid is a most unpleasant death.
So, where do we go from here, Aunt Jane?
Our most likely suspecfs become our latest victim.
Do you realise there were at least 40 people at that party and no one saw the poison being put into the glass?
Come now, Dermot. At least three people could have quite easily.
One, the unobservant soul preoccupied with other thoughts,
- completely unaware of what he saw.
- Hmm, second?
The person who may have seen it and thought nothing of it because it seemed quite natural.
In my day, it was considered bad manners, but people today are always putting things in their drinks.
- Pills, medicine. All sorts of things.
- I suppose. And third?
We have the person who actually did it.
The same person who murdered Ella Zielinsky.
Exactly. You know, Dermot, I always think that murder is like a jigsaw.
Until you've fitted in the final piece, you can't see the whole picture.
Obviously, we still have a piece missing.
Now, what was that awful women's name?
Brown boots, sort of Cheltenham type.
- Colethorpe.
- Cynthia Colethorpe, right.
And I distinctly remember it wasn't till halfway through the case when you reminded me about her smelly little Pekingese.
What was its name?
It smelt revoltingly.
Aunt Jane?
Frozen. That frozen look.
What was it that Heather Babcock said to Marina Gregg just before she gave the frozen look?
You mean all that interminable nonsense about how she was ill?
Marina gave her an autograph and it was the most exciting moment of her life.
Yes, it was before she spilled the drink.
- Here it is.
- It's not good enough.
We've got to know Heather's exact words.
I'm not sure that I follow you.
- Alice Wetherby's cousin.
- Alice Wetherby's cousin?
She went into a back room one day and found her husband had hung himself from a hook at the top of the ceiling eight feet high'
There was absolutely nothing else in the room except the hook, the body and a small puddle of water beneath his feet.
Nobody could understand how he'd manoeuvred himself to perform the deed, until it was discovered he had purchased a two-foot block of ice from the local fishmonger, 
Mr Croswell.
To this day,
Alice Wetherby's cousin shudders at the mere suggestion of an ice cube in her gin.
Yes, Aunt Jane.
Don't you see, Dermot?
Something as trivial as the suggestion of an ice cube when it becomes associated with another experience, something that caused great grief, it fixes in the mind, stays with you forever.
Yes, but I'm not sure what you're getting at.
If only we knew what
Heather actually said.
Cherry!
Oh, I'm afraid that's impossible.
At least for now. I've sent her away.
Whatever for?
Dear boy,
I don't want her to be murdered too.
Marina, honey.
I brought you something warm to drink.
Hot chocolate.
Do you remember when we used to drink it on those cold nights in Sun Valley?
When there was nothing else to do.
I mean, afterwards.
Sleep tight.
I'll take these.
You won't be needing them any more.
Jason?
Hmm?
- I love you.
- I love you too, baby.
[church bells toll]
[cat meows]
[Miss Marple breathes heavily]
Of course, the vicar!
Thank you, Inch.
If you'll wait, please.
I'm sorry, Miss Marple,
Miss Gregg is not available.
But it is imperative that I see her at once.
My apologies, madam. I have my orders.
Then I shall wait.
- There is a lady here, sir.
- What kind of a lady?
A somewhat elderly lady, sir.
A Miss Marple.
She refuses to leave. Shall I...'?
No. I'll get rid of her.
Mr Rudd. Good morning, Mr Rudd.
Look, Miss, er, Marble, or whatever your name is,
I don't know what you're doing here, but you cannot stay.
It's Marple, and I won't keep you long.
I'm correct, am I not, that that is where your wife stood the day of the murder?
She looked in that direction and then her face froze.
I think you'd better leave.
Bellini's Mother and Child.
A very fine painting.
A present of the Brera Institute in Milano, I believe.
The whole thing is really quite simple, isn't it?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I think you do.
- [Miss Marple] Ah, Dermot.
- Good Lord, Aunt Jane.
I might have guessed you'd be here.
This is the spot where it happened, which makes it so much easier to understand.
It's very simple, if only one looks at it the proper way.
It all began, you see, with the kind of person that Heather Babcock was.
Damn it, that's enough!
The two of you come busting into my house. I want you out. Now!
Perhaps you should call the police,
Mr Rudd.
Let us go back, shall we,
to the moment when
Heather greets Miss Gregg
and launches into her efiusive little tale?
Poor Miss Gregg listened patiently as Heather rattled on,
or at least she appeared to.
And then suddenly
Marina turned her head away.
A strange look came over her face.
A look of doom.
It had nothing to do with Lola Brewster's arrival.
Marina wasn't even looking at her or poor Heather.
She was looking at the Madonna.
A picture of a serene mother holding a beautiful happy baby.
I still don't see the connection.
Of course not, you don't know what Heather actually said.
Yes, but haven't we been through all that last night?
She got out of bed, powdered her nose,
slipped out of the barracks determined to see her idol
then proceeded to the theatre where some relative let her in
and allowed her to watch from the wings.
[cheering]
I still don't see where that gets us.
Neither did I.
And then I thought of the vicar.
I telephoned him in the middle of the night. I wasn't at all popular.
He remembered Heather's convalescence.
She had been ill and spent her sick leave in the village with her mother.
You see,
when Heather Babcock went to the theatre that evening,
she was infectious.
She was suffering from rubella.
More commonly known as German measles.
Your wife had a child that was born mentally retarded.
She never recovered from the shock.
Marina... contracted German measles during the pregnancy.
And she never knew how.
And then one afternoon, a perfect stranger tells her with pleasure, with pride even, what she has done.
And you let me kiss you.
Oh, yes, you did!
What a nice little story, dear.
- Now, can I get you a drink?
- Oh, thank you, yes.
[Marple] A rather perfect murder.
Not exactly as Cherry described it.
I was wrong about one thing.
I deduced that one of the guests at the party took the risk of putting the poison in the glass.
But it was unnecessary.
No one would have noticed
the hostess taking a momentary leave of absence to visit her bathroom
to prepare the fetal potion.
As an actress used to handling props,
she would have had no trouble jogging Heather's elbow,
accidentally spilling her drink and offering her her own.
Marina had to insist that she was the intended victim,
that the murder was aimed at her to support her plot.
She wrote the notes herself
Even doctored her coffee at the studio.
It deceived nearly everybody. Nearly.
But one person saw through it.
You knew, didn't you, Mr Rudd?
It was the notes that made you finally realise.
The notes your wife forgot to tell you about.
If they had been real, she would have informed you at once.
So you decided to protect her.
[Craddock] Mr Rudd,
I'd like to speak to your wife.
[Miss Marple] Would you mind if I saw her first?
Thank you, dear. Mr Rudd.
- Miss Marple.
- Yes, Mr Rudd?
She's dead.
I rather suspected as much.
Couldn't you?
I killed her.
I put poison in her hot chocolate last night.
It was inevitable she would have been discovered.
I couldn't let her face the humiliation.
She's suffered enough.
You must have loved her very much.
Mr Rudd,
I think you better come in here.
Marina?
[Marple] Mr Rudd.
She's given the performance of her life.
Captain!
Something off the port bow.
See if you can match it to that torso that came in last month.
Otherwise, you know, Doc:
"Circumstances Undetermined
Pending a Police Investigation."
Wait a minute.
We got a hand here.
If we can get a fingerprint, we can make this a homicide.
Alright, you give me a cause of death.
I can't give you a cause from this.
It's obvious it's not a suicide, and it's not a natural.
Doc, you know I can't prosecute a homicide without a cause of death.
That means I'd have to go out and find the rest of the body.
No good, Doc.
I got too much on my plate now.
Just a numbers game, huh?
Body count? That's all it is to you guys!
The only way you'll prosecute a murder is if you've got a guy downtown signing a confession!
She ain't gonna make a fool out of me.
Takes the kids and goes to Florida to see her sister, leaves me a note.
Ten years.
- They're all scumbags.
- What?
They're all scumbags.
- Who?
- All of them.
- You're better off.
- Just drive the car, huh?
You'll be driving this car the rest of your life. You don't know nothing.
I'll get that bitch.
She ain't gonna jerk me around.
I'll get her.
- You'll get her.
- Damn straight I will.
One day, this whole city's gonna explode.
Used to be able to play stickball on these streets.
Now look at these guys.
Christ, what's happening?
Hey, girls, you working?
- You buying?
- No, honey, I ain't buying.
Hey, what is that?
You'll break your ass you fall down in those high heels.
- Yeah, so will your sister.
- My what?
Come here, I'll break your face!
Come here!
Hey, man, give us a break, OK?
I said, come here.
Come on, you already hauled my ass in last week, hard-on.
A lot of good it did me.
Come on, baby, I cannot handle another bust this month.
Look, you're on my corner again, shithead.
You know what that means?
Get in the car.
In the car.
Pussy.
You remind me of a fella I used to know.
He used to be a coke sucker.
Before that, he was a cork soaker!
- You guys are hilarious.
- Yeah?
Come up here,
I wanna show you my nightstick.
Move your ass.
Get up here.
Do I qualify?
- I hate cigarettes.
- Oh, really?
- I think they're disgusting.
- Well, I enjoy them.
All it is, is anal regressive.
If you wanna quit, I suggest you try another form of childhood stroke.
I don't wanna quit.
I suggest you try an ostrich feather along the small of your back, up your spine to the nape of your neck.
Sounds addictive.
- Why do you come here?
- Why do you?
Because I'm having ego problems,
I need to be worshipped and adored.
- Where you from?
- Mars.
Terrific. I never made it with a Martian before.
What are you doing?
Just looking for a pack of cigarettes.
Why, are you afraid?
Should I be?
Have you ever been ripped off?
I don't have anything to take.
I can't believe you're not afraid.
♪ Who's here?
♪ I'm here
♪ You're here
Now I'm afraid.
Yeah.
Lie down.
Go on.
Lie down.
Yeah.
Turn over.
I said, turn over.
- What are you gonna do?
- I know what I have to do.
Please...
I don't wanna make this too tight for you.
Please. Please.
Please. Please.
You made me do that.
Anus was dilated at the time of death, slight rupture above the anus indicating intercourse.
We found semen, but I can't identify it.
- What do you mean?
- Aspermia.
In English.
No sperm.
Your killer's shooting blanks.
His semen tested positively, but it doesn't have any sperm in it.
Why not?
Well, maybe he has some physical aberration or a malfunction.
Could be his testes are infected, maybe he had a vasectomy.
What else?
Well, this first wound here, that's clean, which means he never knew it was coming.
But this one and these, they're defensive, which means he tried to resist.
So we have a top-to-bottom grouping, and from the angle of entry,
I'd say your killer was right-handed.
- This knife is leaving its own fingerprints.
- That's right.
And from the serrations, the width of the cut,
Approximately three inches into the flesh,
I'd say it matches the other killing pretty close. Close enough.
I know him.
Yeah, I know this guy.
He don't come around no more.
He beat some guys out of some bread.
I know this dude, too.
I seen him on the deuce.
He gives the best beatings like six ways from Sunday.
Didn't you work uptown with him?
Work uptown with him, man? No.
I don't work with nobody.
A john just comes to me and tells me what he wants.
Have fantasy will travel.
Well, that fellow was seen with the Columbia professor who got whacked.
And he says that you introduced him.
That's possible. See?
But this guy ain't no killer.
- I mean he's a pull-together hustler.
- Alright.
I gotta talk to you, alone.
OK.
I need a favor, man.
These two cops working out of 6th Precinct, they been leaning on me.
Who are they?
I think one guy's name is Simone or something like that.
The other guy is Jerry something or whatever.
They're partners.
A couple of real fucking hard-ons.
And dig, they run me the other night, and this guy Simone, he made me give him head right in his radio car.
Take your foot off the table.
- You're full of shit.
- I swear to Christ!
How do you know they're cops?
Cos they're wearing shields and riding around in a radio car.
- What are their shield numbers?
- They work out of the 6th Precinct.
You know how many guys were arrested last year for impersonating a cop?
There's more guys out there impersonating cops than there are cops.
- I need this favor, man.
- You wanna put on a wire?
I'll take you down to Internal Affairs, we'll draw up a complaint.
Listen to what I'm saying.
These guys are bad dudes!
You get me names or numbers, otherwise don't come around with stories.
Listen, man, you need me just as much as I need you!
Take a hike.
Son of a bitch.
- Captain Edelstein?
- Edelson.
I'm sorry. I'm Steve Burns.
Close the door. Sit down.
Burns... why do you think you were called down here?
I don't know, they told me that there was some special assignment and that I was right for it.
Let me ask you something.
Have you ever had your cock sucked by a man?
A man? No. Er...
Ever been porked?
Or had a man smoke your pole?
Ha-ha! You gotta be kidding.
- Yeah, you're kidding, I knew it.
- No.
No? Well, you got the wrong guy,
I guess, that's all.
Take a look at the board over there.
Paul Vincent was a professor at Columbia University.
Loren Lukas was an actor.
Oh, the St. James Hotel stabbing.
I read about that.
How'd you like to disappear?
- Disappear?
- Go undercover.
These killings have a similar M.O., but we've also been finding parts of bodies floating in the river.
We don't know a thing about these torso victims.
We don't even know who they are yet.
But it's my hunch that they were done by the same guy who did these killings up here.
So why me?
Well, frankly, all of the victims appear to be the same physical type.
Which is to say, they all look like you.
Late 20s, 140-150lbs.
Dark hair, dark eyes.
I see.
I wanna send you out there to see if you can attract this guy.
Out where?
Lukas and Vincent were not in the mainstream of gay life.
They were into heavy leather, S&M.
It's a world unto itself.
I don't know how much you know about that sort of thing.
If you take this assignment, you'll come out with more experience than any of my detectives.
Er... do I carry a gun?
No gun, no shield.
You get paid once a month.
You get a call telling you where to pick up the money. You report only to me.
And nobody can know anything about what you're doing.
- Up the creek without a paddle, huh?
- What do you say?
Yeah, I love it.
What's this new thing you're doing?
I can't talk about it, Nance, I told you.
Why not?
Because I just can't, so please don't ask me, OK?
Don't ask me.
How long are you gonna be gone?
Oh, I don't know.
- Is it dangerous?
- I don't know.
I think it is, yeah.
Why do it, then?
Skip patrol, gold shield right away.
Can we talk about something else, yeah?
Your father called today.
Yeah?
Gold shield?
I didn't realize you were so ambitious.
There's a lot about me you don't know.
Such as?
Hi.
- Hi.
- When did you move in?
Er... yesterday.
Yesterday afternoon.
I must've been asleep with the air conditioner on.
I've been sleeping days and working nights.
Like Fidel Castro, only he's running a whole country.
- Right.
- I'm Ted Bailey.
- I'm John Forbes.
- Hi.
You doing a little housecleaning?
Oh, these, yeah.
Somebody left them in my closet.
Yeah, that was Bobby.
He had exotic tastes.
Er, don't put them in the trash bin.
Mrs. McGuire likes it if we stack our magazines.
She sells them.
- You're putting me on.
- No.
She hasn't figured out how to sell ordinary garbage, so that she lets us throw out.
- And don't hang any pictures.
- I know, she told me.
Hey, you got time for a cup of coffee?
Really primo, right down the street.
Dinnertime I only eat seafood.
I gotta watch myself or I balloon up like Shelley Winters.
It's worse when I'm working on something.
I hope my typing didn't bother you.
- What are you working on?
- I'm trying to finish a play.
Oh, yeah? What kind of play?
Boy meets boy, boy loses boy, boy ends up with analyst.
It's a light romantic comedy.
It's old-fashioned and sophisticated.
The kind nobody's interested in anymore.
Well, I hope that doesn't bother you.
Ha! Hell, no. Listen, it'd be hard to be ignored if I was Paddy Chayefsky.
But I'm just trying to make a buck.
Hey...
Things are tough right now, but I feel it's my destiny to be recognized.
But my roommate works steadily, so we get by.
- What's your roommate do?
- He's a dancer. Gregory Milanese.
He's out of town right now working on a musical.
He's trying out in Westport or someplace.
So I'm at loose ends, so to speak.
- How about yourself?
- Oh, I just quit school. Art school.
Looking for a job, commercial artist.
- Good luck.
- Yeah.
So where you been living?
Well, I was living in the Bronx with my folks.
The first Braille waitress!
Hey, did you read about the killings?
"Homo killer on the prowl"?
- Yeah, I was reading about that.
- Talk of every gay bar in town.
- Scared to death of cruising myself.
- They're gonna get that guy.
- The cops are gonna get him.
- The cops?
Listen, they get their hands on him, they'll make him a member of the Vice Squad.
Let me tell you. We had another killing like this one about five or six months ago.
I don't even think it made the papers, but we heard about it around here.
The victim was a teacher at Columbia.
They found him in his apartment in about ten pieces.
Detectives came around asking questions for a couple of days, nothing came of it.
I guess you can't be too careful, huh?
Excuse me.
Could I ask you about these?
What about them?
What are they for?
A light-blue hanky in your left back pocket means you want a blow job.
Right pocket means you give one.
The green one left side says you're a hustler, right side you're a buyer.
The yellow one left side means you give a golden shower, right side you receive.
- The red one is...
- Right, thank you.
- See anything you want?
- Er...
I'm gonna go home and think about it.
I'm sure you'll make the right choice.
Alright!
You into water sports?
No, I just... I like to watch.
- Later.
- Yeah.
If you like to watch, take that hanky out of your pocket, asshole.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
'Yes!'
'Yes!'
- How you doing?
- Good.
Bartenders are starting to give me some information, like who the regulars are, who's been there before, who ain't, that stuff.
Good. What else?
Ah... Oh, yeah, there's this name keeps popping up all the time.
Tommy Mancusi.
He owns the Cock Pit, four, five other places.
"Tommy the Joker" they call him.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
You trying to tell me you don't know who Tommy the Joker is?
I don't know who he is.
Well, I do.
I can't move on him.
Why not?
I ask the questions.
You dropped your chalk.
- See you later.
- Watch yourself.
You bet!
I think he's cruising.
- Great night.
- Yeah, it is.
- Wanna get a beer?
- Oh, I don't know. It's kind of late.
I'd invite you up to my apartment, but I don't have air conditioning yet.
Oh, that's too bad.
- How about the park?
- Fine.

Where are you, man?
Come on.
Where are you?
Don't play games with me, man.
Where are you?
I'm waiting for you.
- Everything's ready.
- Good.
Nance...
Why don't you lie down for a little while?
Don't let me lose you.
- Uh-uh.
- OK?
- Don't let me lose you.
- I love you.
You're not gonna lose me.
I love you so much.
Gregory called me last night.
Remember roommate Gregory?
Seems the star of the show has hepatitis and the tour's canceled till he recovers.
Show closes in Bucks County tonight, he'll be home tomorrow.
- That should make you happy.
- Overjoyed.
Listen, I never told you about Gregory and me.
You know what he said when he called me up?
He said I should forget about my writing and find a job till his show reopens.
He says it's my turn to work now.
He intends to flop on the beach and turn nut brown.
His very words. Damn.
I was counting on having the rest of the summer.
I could've finished by Labor Day.
- So tell him.
- I did.
At which point, dear Gregory said that the world could wait for any play I might turn out, but the summer sun waits for no man.
Who knows?
He might be right about this play.
He was right, God knows, about the others I've written.
Nobody else cared much about them either.
So I guess I'll work my bricks off.
We need the money.
Gregory's tired.
It's fair enough, I suppose.
You, er... you really feel like that?
No.
I'm seething.
I'm not exactly mad enough to kill, but I am mad enough for something.
Bobby, the guy that used to have your room, he used to get this way, only worse.
He'd slam out the door, go stomping off down the stairs.
I never knew what set him off, but later he'd tell me where he went.
Usually the baths.
He'd check in, blow a dozen guys in an hour.
You ready for that?
No. I'm not ready for that.
But I understand what made him feel that way.
I hate Mondays.
Oh, Ted, I wish I could help you, do something for you.
You do?
You do.
Where you going, friend?
- What do you mean?
- Got a knife, gun, anything at all?
- Why? What's wrong?
- You a police officer?
- What?
- This is Precinct Night.
You got the wrong attitude. I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Right.
You looking for something?
That bulge in your pants ain't a knife.
Why don't we take a walk?
Yeah...
Not tonight.
Joey, listen, you'll come before 7:00 on Sunday night, won't you?
Cross my heart. I'll be on the island if you need to reach me.
I don't have that number.
It's on the wall in your kitchen under "reminders".
Oh, alright.
You know how paranoid Bess gets if dinner starts one minute after 8:00 the night before she's shooting.
Not to worry!
I have Margo's dress to finish.
She opens in Vegas in two weeks.
- Have fun.
- I'll try.
You made me do that.
- It's my place as much as yours.
- As if the hell it is.
- When did you pay rent?
- I paid rent!
- Which you get out your ass.
- You just listen to me.
- In Westport?
- Yeah...
When will you be on Broadway?
As soon as you get a play on Broadway!
- How did he get hepatitis?
- That's none of your goddamn business.
- You're asking me about my life.
- I'm not asking you about your life!
- I don't have to ask a thing!
- What is it? I told you.
It's a ridiculous, idiotic.
- Your life is a flop play!
- Let's see yours.
- Your life is just beating my ass.
- That's life!
Get someone else. I don't think you'll find anything as big as this.
Bullshit, man.
I can find anybody I want.
- Oh, you're so good-looking and so fine.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Answer just one question.
- Yeah.
When you gonna get it into that stupid head of yours?
You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
I'm making $650 a week dancing my ass off, while you're just playing...
Right now, what do you make?
I gotta pay the rent.
P.C.'s on the phone, the mayor's on the phone.
Every gay group in the city is stomping around my office all day.
Now, what in Christ more do you need, Dave?
I just have to do more with the information I already have.
Dave, you got 23 years on the job.
I'd like to see you go out on a high note, but both our reputations are at stake on this one.
I went to the P.C.,
I recommended you for the squad, and I am not going to have this thing explode on me.
I understand that.
So wrap it up.
I don't care how you do it.
You clean this thing up before the Democratic convention comes in, or I will put somebody in your office who can.
Skipper, we found this quarter in the coin box at the peep show.
The blood matches the victim's, but not this print we lifted from it.
Take a walk?
I'll tear your goddamn head off.
The guy by the pinball machine.
The guy with the... the eagle on his jacket.
Oh, yeah, his name's Skip Lee.
He's a bad dude.
The other night he got stoned out, came on to a guy at the Eagle's Nest.
The guy gave him the swerve,
Skip went for his throat.
Leave him alone. He's a scumbag.
- Hey, baby, what's happening?
- I'm with someone.
Aren't we all? Wanna dance?
- There he is.
- The one with the red scarf?
No, the one with the hat.
The one on the outside.
He calls himself Skip.
I don't know his last name.
- He's been in a lot of hassles here.
- Is that the one that followed you?
- Yeah.
- Why didn't you go with him?
I don't know.
I... I kind of choked.
But I think you should check him.
Red card you win, black card you lose.
That's a black and that's a black.
- I won't say that. Anybody else?
- I bet 10.
Ten dollars, put it up. Ten dollar to win.
Oh, I got a winner, I gotta pay.
I don't get mad when I lose.
Now watch my red number and my black number.
I need some information on a guy called Skip.
Twenty-six, maybe 27 years old.
He's a regular at the Cock Pit and the Anvil.
Yeah, Skip Lee? He works at a steakhouse in Penn Station, The Iron Horse.
- Got it.
- Hey!
Edelson take care of those two cops for me?
He's working on it.
- Well, I got something else.
- What?
You know that guy that was killed up at the Ramble?
Couple of my friends were up there that night. They said they heard singing.
- Singing?
- Yeah, nursery rhyme, like...
♪ Who's here? We're here ♪
Something like that.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- Table for two?
- Yeah.
This way, please.
There you go.
- OK.
- Thank you.
Enjoy your dinner.
- There's our boy.
- Hmm-mm.
Yes, would you like a drink before dinner?
- Yeah, Heineken.
- OK.
And what about you, sir?
Something to drink?
- I'll have... I'll have a steak.
- OK.
- Make it two.
- Right. How would you like those cooked?
- Rare.
- Medium.
The pattern of lacerations match the serrations.
The depth and the width of the stab wounds could all have been made with this type blade.
Could you take off an arm or a leg with that thing?
You'd have to be very strong.
But, yes, it could get the job done.
This is what you're looking for.
Your man's carrying this.
Come on, guys, let's get it going.
Another half-hour, I'm on overtime.
Yeah.
Let's go to work.
Here we go.
- 'What's that?'
- 'Well, there's two of us here.'
'Are you kidding?
That's not my scene.'
'OK, then, you tie me up.'
- 'No, that's too weird, man.'
- 'Are you saying you won't do it?'
- 'Well, I just don't get into that.'
- 'Yeah, but I do.'
'You want me to tie you up and then what do you want me to do?'
'Do whatever you want.'
Let's get out of here.
'And do what?'
- Huh? What the hell is this?
- Get your ass in there!
- Against the wall!
- What's going on?
- Gimme your hand.
- What's your name?
What are you doing here?
- Did he try anything?
- No.
- Did he show you his knife?
- No.
Now, what were you faggots doing up there?
What is this shit, huh?
- You were gonna stick him, weren't you?
- What are you talking about?
- Whose room was it?
- His.
Is that right?
I... I told you, what we were doing in there is none of your business.
- So you had no right to come in there...
- I wanna know what you were doing.
- Nothing!
- Nothing?
He's tied up, lying face down.
Nothing?
Is this what you had in mind for him?
Listen, we got enough to stick you away for three years right now.
- It's as tight as a chicken's ass.
- Now, you wanna do yourself a favor?
Hey, listen...
This guy cruised me.
I didn't even know him.
I don't even know his name.
He got me to go up to his room with him!
- That's bullshit.
- Is that right?
I told you it was my room.
That's all I'm gonna tell you.
I wanna see a lawyer.
- What the hell was that?
- Did he show you his knife?
- What'd he hit me for?
- Who paid for the room?
- What was that?
- Who paid for the room?
- What'd he hit me for?
- Who paid for the room?
- I told you, I did!
- He did, man!
Alright, let's separate these two girls.
- Come on, get up.
- Let's go.
Come on, get up.
Come on, get in there!
You came in too soon, Sonny.
You were too soon.
Hey, you really hit me, man.
You know this man?
No.
What about him, Skip?
Recognize him?
Have you ever seen him before?
- Him?
- What do you want from me, huh?
'I never killed nobody.
You better let me see a lawyer, man!'
Tremendous.
Oh, Nolan Ryan.
You know he did that off the two-hitter too?
Oh, come on!
- Who is that guy?
- Ever see a knife like this, Skip?
I see them every day.
They give them out where I work.
Do you have one like it?
- What do you want from me, huh?
- You're a lying son of a bitch.
Skip, the day Martino
Perry was killed, you were seen coming out of his store.
I bought him an ounce of grass.
Get up! Get on your feet!
Get your pants down.
- What?
- Watch my lips.
- Get your pants down!
- Get them off!
'You're gonna jerk off, mister.'
'We're gonna get a sample of your sperm.'
Then you're gonna take the floating-ball test.
What's that?
We're gonna fill that sink with water, then we're gonna dip your balls in it, and if they don't float...
...you're our main man.
Do you understand that?
The prints don't match.
The print on the quarter's different than the kid's print.
Listen, boss, let me have this guy.
I'm telling you, I can make him give it up.
He's only been working in that steak joint a little over two months.
You got nothing.
He's the wrong guy.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Why didn't you use your key?
Can I come in?
Er... I'm on my way out.
OK.
What's going on?
Nothing.
Why can't you trust me?
I don't wanna talk about it, Nance.
- Is it me? Are you turned off to me?
- No.
Why don't you want me anymore?
I'm tired, that's all.
I'm not an idiot.
Nance, what I'm doing is affecting me.
I'm on your side, you know?
I don't know, I...
I don't understand what's happening to you.
Neither do I.
Maybe we should cut loose for a while.
Yeah.
Yeah. OK.
Steve?
Forget it.
I don't understand how you let those guys work me over like that.
Welcome to the Detective Division.
We're gonna have to find another way, because I'm not getting paid enough to go through this.
You think I enjoy it? We're looking for a killer. We gotta make it convincing.
Look, the guy was innocent.
You worked him over like he shot the president or something.
You destroyed that kid.
You didn't even have a case against him.
You fingered him.
I didn't think anybody was gonna go that far with him.
- Sometimes you only get that one chance.
- He didn't have a knife.
I didn't come on this job to shitcan some guy just cos he's gay, Captain.
You're gonna come into days where you have to collar a dozen guys like that.
Scared, weird little guys who don't know why they have to do what they do.
It isn't their fault, it isn't your fault, it's the job.
I can't do the job.
I don't think I can do the job, Captain.
I don't think I can handle it, that's all.
I don't know...
It's just... It's...
Things happening to me, you know.
I don't know that I can handle it.
I want you to know that it's not because I'm afraid or anything.
It's just stuff going down,
I don't think I can... I can deal with it.
I need you.
You're my partner and you can't let me down.
We're up to our ass in this, and I'm counting on you.
Steve...
This is from the Columbia University yearbook.
These pictures go back two years.
There's a check mark next to every student who ever took a class from that Columbia professor who got killed.
I'd like you to take this and see if you can recognize anybody.
'Registrar's office.
Good morning.'
Yes, I'm trying to locate a student,
Stuart Richards.
He's in the department of Music and Speech.
'Is he enrolled in the summer session?'
Er... yes, I believe he is.
- 'Would you wait just a moment, please?'
- Yes.
- 'Hold on.'
- Yes.
'The last address I have on Stuart Richards...'
Hold on just a second, please. Yes?
- 'It's 140...'
- One-forty.
- 'Claremont Ave., Morningside Heights.'
- Thank you.
God, what is this? Sheep shit?
What do you expect for 50 cents a pack?
I didn't realize things were getting that rough.
I think my old man's about to draw the line again.
- He turned me down on a car.
- Oh, yeah?
He doesn't understand why I'd want a car to do research in a library that's right across the street from where I live.
So what are you gonna do?
Live within my meager means and continue my thesis on the roots of the American musical theater.
All in the way of buying two more years before I have to go out in the world.
I didn't mean your plans for life, Stuie.
What about tonight?
- Don't call me Stuie, OK?
- Sorry.
I got a lot of stuff to do tonight, Paul.
I have to go out. I should do more work.
Well, if you get tired of studying,
Maybe I can get my old man to adopt you.
- You're too kind.
- You noticed.
Father, I need to talk to you.
I wish just once you'd say something positive to me.
I've tried to do everything you wanted, but it's never good enough.
I've taken it for granted that you understood, Stuie.
You know what you have to do.
'You know what you have to do.'
- Yes?
- I'm looking for Ted.
- I got the room next door.
- You must be the famous John Forbes.
- You must be Greg.
- Yeah, looks as if I got back just in time.
What do you mean?
Do you usually come barging in on Ted at dinnertime?
I don't know whether that's any of your business.
Wrong. It's exactly my business.
Anyway, you struck out tonight.
Ted isn't here.
Where is he?
If you must know, he's out working an IBM machine in a primo brokerage house.
It pays well because normal folk don't like working at night.
It's good for him, cos when he's out working he's not out getting involved.
- If you know what I mean?
- No, I don't know what you mean.
- No?
- No.
Ted is too sensitive to have too many involvements.
We found that out with the last piece of trash that moved in.
It must be something about that room, the people it attracts, do you suppose?
You bastard.
Pussy.
Come on, you cocksucker!
Just do it again and I'll call the police, asshole!
Fuck.
Oh, shit.
Motherfucker!
You're in love with him.
You love Ted, don't you?
You're crazy, mister.
You ought to be committed!
You wanna play, I'll play with you!
Get out.
Got a light?
Thanks.
♪ Who's here? I'm here
♪ You're here... ♪
You're very funny.
You got a place?
Yeah, I have a place.
But it's not available right now.
- We could go to my place.
- Yeah, where is that?
- West Village.
- Too far. How about...
...right down there in the tunnel?
Well... I'm not too crazy about public places.
Oh, don't worry, Dorothy, there's nobody around.
- How big are you?
- Party size.
- What are you into?
- I go anywhere.
- I don't do anything.
- That's cool.
Hips or lips?
Bashful?
No.
Then get them down.
I wanna see the world.
Go for it.
Stuart, the man you attacked the other night was a police officer.
He attacked me.
We know you killed Martino Perry.
Your fingerprint was on the quarter.
We're going to indict on that.
The upside for you is twenty to life.
That's all you're gonna get, an indictment.
If you confess to the murder of Martino Perry and Loren Lukas and Eric Rossman, and four or five others we think you're involved in, we'll reduce your sentence.
You'll do eight years, no more.
I've talked to the D.A., and he's willing to go along.
I never killed anyone.
You'll have to run it down for the grand jury.
- Grand jury?
- Just a formality.
Once you've been cleared, you can never be sued or face any charges.
We'll present the evidence, tell them what your assignment was, they'll go for necessary force, and you'll walk away.
You know, Captain, er...
I appreciate the chance you gave me.
You were there for me.
I... I...
I appreciate it.
Your orders should come down after the grand jury.
Meanwhile, take the rest of the week off.
Burns...
Welcome to the Detective Division.
Thanks.
- Captain Edelman.
- Edelstein.
Do you know any of these people,
Mr. Gaines?
Er... they look like pictures of Stuart when he was a kid.
I got a box of old letters here.
All addressed to, er...
John L. Richards, St. Louis.
- That was his father.
- I wonder why he never sent these.
He's been dead for 10 years.
Oh, yeah?
I guess he never got over it.
He used to talk about him like he was alive.
Huh...
Are you Mazzillo?
Right in there, Captain.
- What time did you hear the voices?
- About 2:15, 2:30.
Did you hear anything they were saying?
Captain...
The landlady discovered the body about 2:30 a.m.
The guy downstairs heard some screaming.
He's giving the details to Desher outside.
Who is he?
Name is Ted Bailey. Works in a brokerage house downtown, part-time, nights.
Went to the beach today with three friends.
Got back about 6:00, went to work.
And he must've got hit just after he came home.
There's no sign of a struggle, nothing seems to be stolen.
Must've been someone he knew.
I think we got the murder weapon in there. It's a kitchen knife.
He had a roommate by the name of, er... Gregory Milanese.
He's a dancer.
We got an alarm out for him.
Looks like a lover's quarrel to me.
- Di Simone.
- Sir?
- Sixth Precinct.
- Yes, sir.
Who lives in that apartment down the hall?
A guy called Casey, but he's away for the summer.
The one next door is registered in the name of John Forbes.
The landlady thinks it's phoney, cos she ain't seen him in a couple days.
What's that name?
John Forbes.
Jesus Christ.
Sir?
- When did you get in?
- A little while ago.
I'm back.
Can I stay?
Sure.
I'm glad.
I need to talk to you.
I wanna tell you everything.
OK? Let me just get this off.
